Europe was proposed; but though there is much enjoyment\r\nfor a naturalist in contact with the active scientific life of the Old\r\nWorld, there is little intellectual rest. Toward Brazil I was drawn by a\r\nlifelong desire. After the death of Spix, when a student of twenty years\r\nof age, I had been employed by Martius to describe the fishes they had\r\nbrought back with them from their celebrated Brazilian journey. From\r\nthat time, the wish to study this fauna in the regions where it belongs\r\nhad been an ever-recurring thought with me; a scheme deferred for want\r\nof opportunity, but never quite forgotten. The fact that the Emperor of\r\nBrazil was deeply interested in all scientific undertakings, and had\r\nexpressed a warm sympathy with my efforts to establish a great\r\nzoölogical museum in this country, aiding me even by sending collections\r\nmade expressly under his order for the purpose, was an additional\r\nincentive. I knew that the head of the government would give me every\r\nfacility for my investigations. Nevertheless, tempting as was the\r\nprospect of a visit to Brazil, as a mere vacation it had little charm\r\nfor me. Single-handed, I could make slight use of the opportunities I\r\nshould have; and though the excursion might be a pleasant one for\r\nmyself, it would have no important result for science. I could not\r\nforget that, had I only the necessary means, I might make collections on\r\nthis journey which, whenever our building could be so enlarged as to\r\ngive room for their exhibition, would place the Museum in Cambridge on a\r\nlevel with the first institutions of the kind. But for this a working\r\nforce would be needed, and I saw no possibility of providing for such an\r\nundertaking. While I was brooding over these thoughts I chanced to meet\r\nMr. Nathaniel Thayer, whom I have ever found a generous friend to\r\nscience. The idea of appealing to him for a scheme of this magnitude had\r\nnot, however, occurred to me; but he introduced the subject, and, after\r\nexpressing his interest in my proposed journey, added, “You wish, of\r\ncourse, to give it a scientific character; take six assistants with you,\r\nand I will be responsible for all their expenses, personal and\r\nscientific.” It was so simply said, and seemed to me so great a boon,\r\nthat at first I hardly believed I had heard him rightly. In the end, I\r\nhad cause to see in how large and liberal a sense he proffered his\r\nsupport to the expedition, which, as is usual in such cases, proved\r\nlonger and more costly than was at first anticipated. Not only did he\r\nprovide most liberally for assistants, but, until the last specimen was\r\nstored in the Museum, he continued to advance whatever sums were needed,\r\nalways desiring me to inform him should any additional expenses occur on\r\nclosing up the affairs of the expedition. It seems to me that the good\r\narising from the knowledge of such facts justifies me in speaking here\r\nof these generous deeds, accomplished so unostentatiously that they\r\nmight otherwise pass unnoticed.\r\n\r\nAll obstacles thus removed from my path, I made my preparations for\r\ndeparture as rapidly as possible. The assistants I selected to accompany\r\nme were Mr. James Burkhardt as artist, Mr. John G. Anthony as\r\nconchologist, Mr. Frederick C. Hartt and Mr. Orestes St. John as\r\ngeologists, Mr. John A. Allen as ornithologist, and Mr. George Sceva as\r\npreparator. Beside these, my party was enlarged by several volunteers,\r\nto whom I was indebted for assistance as untiring and efficient as if\r\nthey had been engaged for the purpose. These were Mr. Newton Dexter, Mr.\r\nWilliam James, Mr. Edward Copeland, Mr. Thomas Ward, Mr. Walter\r\nHunnewell, and Mr. S. V. R. Thayer. I should not omit to mention my\r\nbrother-in-law, Mr. Thomas G. Cary, as one of my aids; for, though not\r\nnominally connected with the expedition, he made collections for me at\r\nMonte Video, Buenos Ayres, and other places. I was also joined by my\r\nfriends Dr. and Mrs. Cotting. Dr. Cotting, like myself, was in need of a\r\nvacation, and it was his intention to remain with us for as long a time\r\nas he could spare from his professional practice. But the climate proved\r\nunfavorable to his health, and after passing a couple of months in Rio,\r\nand sharing with us all our excursions in that neighborhood, he sailed\r\nwith Mrs. Cotting for Europe, where they passed the summer. His presence\r\nwith us during that time was most fortunate, for it so happened that the\r\nonly serious cases of illness we had among us occurred before he left,\r\nand his medical advice and care were of great service. I lost the\r\nassistance of Mr. Anthony, and Mr. Allen also, early in the expedition;\r\ntheir health, always delicate, obliging them to leave for home. With\r\nthese exceptions, our working force remained intact, and I am happy to\r\nstate that every member of the party returned in safety to the United\r\nStates.[1]\r\n\r\nNo sooner was the Brazilian Expedition known to the public, than I\r\nreceived a letter from Mr. Allen McLane, President of the Pacific Mail\r\nSteamship Company, offering to me and my whole party the hospitality of\r\ntheir magnificent ship the Colorado, then just sailing from New York for\r\nthe Pacific coast. She was going almost empty of passengers, being bound\r\nby the way of Cape Horn for San Francisco. We left New York on board\r\nthis beautiful vessel, on the 1st of April, 1865. The record of our\r\ndelightful voyage to Rio de Janeiro will be found in the narrative; but\r\nI wish here publicly to acknowledge my obligation to Mr. McLane for his\r\ngenerosity to the expedition. Besides the sympathy accorded me by\r\nprivate individuals, I have to thank the Hon. Gideon Welles, Secretary\r\nof the Navy, for a general order, received on the eve of my departure,\r\ndesiring the officers of the United States Navy, wherever I should fall\r\nin with them, to afford me such assistance in my scientific researches\r\nas would not interfere with the regular service; and I learned at Rio\r\nthat Mr. Seward had warmly recommended the expedition to General Webb,\r\nat that time United States Minister to Brazil. Finally, I would express\r\nmy thanks also to Messrs. Garrison and Allen for the free passage\r\noffered to myself and my companions for our return, on board the line of\r\nsteamers established between New York and Rio de Janeiro during our stay\r\nin Brazil.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen hereafter what facilities were granted me throughout\r\nthis journey by the Brazilians themselves, and that the undertaking, so\r\nwarmly speeded on its way, was welcomed no less cordially in the country\r\nto which it was bound.\r\n\r\nOne word as to the manner in which this volume has grown into its\r\npresent shape, for it has been rather the natural growth of\r\ncircumstances than the result of any preconceived design. Partly for the\r\nentertainment of her friends, partly with the idea that I might make\r\nsome use of it in knitting together the scientific reports of my journey\r\nby a thread of narrative, Mrs. Agassiz began this diary. I soon fell\r\ninto the habit of giving her daily the more general results of my\r\nscientific observations, knowing that she would allow nothing to be lost\r\nwhich was worth preserving. In consequence of this mode of working, our\r\nseparate contributions have become so closely interwoven that we should\r\nhardly know how to disconnect them, and our common journal is therefore\r\npublished, with the exception of a few unimportant changes, almost as it\r\nwas originally written. In this volume I have attempted only to give\r\nsuch an account of my scientific work and its results as would explain\r\nto the public what were the aims of the expedition, and how far they\r\nhave been accomplished. It is my hope to complete a work, already begun,\r\non the Natural History, and especially on the Fishes of Brazil, in which\r\nwill be recorded not only my investigations during the journey and those\r\nof my assistants in their independent excursions, but also the\r\nresearches now regularly carried on in connection with the immense\r\nBrazilian collections stored in the Museum at Cambridge. This must,\r\nhowever, be the slow labor of many years, and can only be published very\r\ngradually. In the mean time I hope that this forerunner of the more\r\nspecial reports may serve to show that our year in Brazil, full as it\r\nwas of enjoyment for all the party, was also rich in permanent results\r\nfor science.\r\n\r\n                                                             L. AGASSIZ.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1:\r\n\r\n  There is but one sad record I have to make connected with this\r\n  journey. My friend and companion of many years, Mr. Burkhardt, died\r\n  about ten months after his return, of a disease which, though not\r\n  contracted in Brazil, since it was of some years’ standing, was no\r\n  doubt aggravated by the hot climate. His great desire to accompany me\r\n  led him, against my advice, to undertake a journey which, in his case,\r\n  was a dangerous one. He suffered very much during our stay on the\r\n  Amazons, but I could not persuade him to leave his work; and in the\r\n  following pages it will be seen that his industry was unflagging.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           TABLE OF CONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n                 VOYAGE FROM NEW YORK TO RIO DE JANEIRO.\r\n\r\n                                                                    PAGE\r\n\r\n First Sunday at Sea.—Gulf Stream.—Gulf-Weed.—Lectures\r\n   proposed.—First Lecture: On the Gulf Stream in the Gulf\r\n   Stream.—Aquarium established on board.—Second Lecture.—Rough\r\n   Sea.—Peculiar Tint of Water.—Third Lecture: Laying out Work\r\n   of Expedition in Brazil; Distribution of Fishes in Brazilian\r\n   Rivers; its Bearing on Origin of Species; Collecting of\r\n   Eggs.—Tropical Sunset.—Fourth Lecture: Plan of Geological\r\n   Investigations with special reference to Glacial Phenomena in\r\n   South America.—Flying-Fish.—Fifth Lecture: Glacial Phenomena,\r\n   continued.—Second Sunday at Sea.—Rough Water.—Sixth Lecture:\r\n   Embryological Investigations as a Guide to sound\r\n   Classification.—Seventh Lecture.—Moonlight\r\n   Nights.—Trade-Winds.—Eighth Lecture: Importance of Precision\r\n   in Localizing Specimens.—Southern Cross.—Ninth Lecture:\r\n   Fresh-water Fishes of Brazil.—Easter Sunday.—First Sight of\r\n   South American Shore.—Olinda.—Pernambuco.—Catamarans.—Tenth\r\n   Lecture: Methods of Collecting.—Eleventh Lecture:\r\n   Classification of Fishes as illustrated by\r\n   Embryology.—Preparations for Arrival.—Twelfth Lecture:\r\n   Practical Lesson in Embryology.—Closing Lecture:\r\n   Transmutation Theory; Intellectual and Political\r\n   Independence.—Resolutions and Speeches.—Singular Red Patches\r\n   on the Surface of the Sea                                        1–45\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n             RIO DE JANEIRO AND ITS ENVIRONS.—JUIZ DE FORA.\r\n\r\n Arrival.—Aspect of Harbor and City.—Custom-House.—First Glimpse\r\n   of Brazilian Life.—Negro Dance.—Effect of Emancipation in\r\n   United States upon Slavery in Brazil.—First Aspect of Rio de\r\n   Janeiro on Land.—Picturesque Street Groups.—Eclipse of the\r\n   Sun.—At Home in Rio.—Larangeiras.—Passeio Publico.—Excursion\r\n   on the Dom Pedro Railroad.—Visit of the Emperor to the\r\n   Colorado.—Cordiality of the Government to the\r\n   Expedition.—Laboratory.—Botanical Garden.—Alley of\r\n   Palms.—Excursion to the Corcovado.—Juiz de Fora\r\n   Road.—Petropolis.—Tropical Vegetation.—Ride from Petropolis\r\n   to Juiz de Fora.—Visit to Senhor Lage.—Excursion to the\r\n   Forest of the Empress.—Visit to Mr. Halfeld.—Return to\r\n   Rio.—News of the Great Northern Victories, and of the\r\n   President’s Assassination                                       46–79\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n                  LIFE IN RIO CONTINUED.—FAZENDA LIFE.\r\n\r\n Botafogo.—Insane Hospital.—Tijuca.—Erratic\r\n   Drift.—Vegetation.—Birthday Dinner.—Arrangements for Parties\r\n   to the Interior.—Public Lectures in Rio.—Procession of St.\r\n   George.—Leave Rio on Excursion to the Fortaleza de Santa\r\n   Anna.—Localities for Erratic Drift between Rio and\r\n   Petropolis.—Departure from Juiz de Fora.—Arrival at the\r\n   Fazenda.

On the right\r\n   are Lianas, from which hang parasitic flowers.\r\n\r\n                   From a photograph by G.

The weather is delicious, the\r\nship as steady as anything on the water can be, and even the most\r\nforlorn of our party have little excuse for sea-sickness. We have had\r\nservice from Bishop Potter this morning, and since then we have been on\r\ndeck reading, walking, watching a singular cloud, which the captain says\r\nis a cloud of smoke, in the direction of Petersburg. We think it may be\r\nthe smoke of a great decisive engagement going on while we sail\r\npeacefully along. What it means, or how the battle ends, if battle it\r\nbe, we shall not know for two months perhaps.[2] Mr. Agassiz is busy\r\nto-day in taking notes, at regular intervals, of the temperature of the\r\nwater, as we approach the Gulf Stream. To-night we cut it at right\r\nangles, and he will remain on deck to continue his observations.\r\n\r\n_April 3d._—The Professor sat up last night as he intended, and found\r\nhis watch, which was shared by one or two of his young assistants, very\r\ninteresting. We crossed the Gulf Stream opposite Cape Hatteras, at a\r\nlatitude where it is comparatively narrow, some sixty miles only in\r\nbreadth. Entering it at about six o’clock, we passed out of it a little\r\nafter midnight. The western boundary of the warm waters stretching along\r\nthe coast had a temperature of about 57°. Immediately after entering it,\r\nthe temperature began to rise gradually, the maximum being about 74°,\r\nfalling occasionally, however, when we passed through a cold streak, to\r\n68°. These cold streaks in the Gulf Stream, which reach to a\r\nconsiderable depth, the warm and cold waters descending together in\r\nimmediate contact for at least a hundred fathoms, are attributed by Dr.\r\nBache to the fact that the Gulf Stream is not stationary. It sways as a\r\nwhole sometimes a little toward the shore, sometimes a little away from\r\nit, and, in consequence of this, the colder water from the coast creeps\r\nin, forming these vertical layers in its midst. The eastern boundary is\r\nwarmer than the western one, for the latter is chilled by the Arctic\r\ncurrents, which form a band of cold water all along the Atlantic shore.\r\nTheir influence is felt nearly to the latitude of Florida. On coming out\r\nof the Gulf Stream the temperature of the water was 68°, and so it\r\ncontinued for an hour longer, after which Mr. Agassiz ceased his\r\nobservations. To-day some of the gulf-weed was gathered by a sailor, and\r\nwe found it crowded with life. Hydroids, in numbers, had their home upon\r\nit; the delicate branching plumularia and a pretty campanularia, very\r\nlike some of our New England species; beside these, bryozoa, tiny\r\ncompound mollusks, crusted its stem, and barnacles were abundant upon\r\nit. These are all the wonders that the deep has yielded us to-day,\r\nthough the pretty Portuguese men-of-war go floating by the vessel, out\r\nof reach thus far. Such are the events of our life: we eat and drink and\r\nsleep, read, study Portuguese, and write up our journals.\r\n\r\n_April 4th._—It has occurred to Mr. Agassiz, as a means of preparing the\r\nyoung men who accompany him for the work before them, to give a course\r\nof lectures on ship-board. Some preparation of the kind is the more\r\nnecessary, since much of the work must be done independently of him, as\r\nit will be impossible for so large a party to travel together; and the\r\ninstructions needed will be more easily given in a daily lecture to all,\r\nthan in separate conversations with each one singly. The idea finds\r\ngeneral favor. The large saloon makes an excellent lecture-room; a\r\ncouple of leaves from the dining-table with a black oil-cloth stretched\r\nacross them serve as a blackboard. The audience consists, not only of\r\nour own company, but includes the few ladies who are on board, Mr.\r\nBradbury, the captain of our steamer, Bishop Potter, some of the ship’s\r\nofficers, and a few additional passengers, all of whom seem to think the\r\nlecture a pleasant break in the monotony of a sea voyage. To-day the\r\nsubject was naturally suggested by the seaweeds of the Gulf Stream, so\r\nrecently caught and so crowded with life,—“A lecture on the Gulf Stream\r\nin the Gulf Stream,” as one of the listeners suggests. It was opened,\r\nhowever, by a few words on the exceptional character of the position of\r\nthis scientific commission on board the Colorado.\r\n\r\n“Fifty years ago, when naturalists carried their investigations to\r\ndistant lands, either government was obliged to provide an expensive\r\noutfit for them, or, if they had no such patronage, scanty opportunities\r\ngrudgingly given might be granted them on ordinary conveyances. Even if\r\nsuch accommodation were allowed them, their presence was looked upon as\r\na nuisance: no general interest was felt in their objects; it was much\r\nif they were permitted, on board some vessel, to have their bucket of\r\nspecimens in a corner, which any sailor might kick over, unreproved, if\r\nit chanced to stand in his way. This ship, and the spirit prevailing in\r\nher command, opens to me a vista such as I never dreamed of till I stood\r\nupon her deck. Here, in place of the meagre chances I remember in old\r\ntimes, the facilities could hardly be greater if the ship had been built\r\nas a scientific laboratory. If any such occasion has ever been known\r\nbefore, if any naturalist has ever been treated with such consideration,\r\nand found such intelligent appreciation of his highest aims, on board a\r\nmerchant-ship fitted up for purposes of trade, I am not aware of it. I\r\nhope the first trip of the Colorado will be remembered in the annals of\r\nscience. I, at least, shall know whom to thank for an opportunity so\r\nunique. This voyage, and the circumstances connected with it, are, to\r\nme, the signs of a good time coming; when men of different interests\r\nwill help each other; when naturalists will be more liberal and sailors\r\nmore cultivated, and natural science and navigation will work hand in\r\nhand. And now for my lecture,—my first lecture on ship-board.”\r\n\r\nThe lecture was given, of course, specimen in hand, the various\r\ninhabitants of the branch of seaweed giving their evidence in succession\r\nof their own structure and way of life. To these living illustrations\r\nwere added drawings on the blackboard to show the transformations of the\r\nanimals, their embryological history, &c.[3] Since the lecture, Captain\r\nBradbury has fitted up a large tank as an aquarium, where any specimens\r\ntaken during the voyage may be preserved and examined. Mr. Agassiz is\r\nperfectly happy, enjoying every hour of the voyage, as well he may,\r\nsurrounded as he is with such considerate kindness.\r\n\r\n_April 6th._—Though I took notes, as usual, of the lecture yesterday, I\r\nhad not energy enough to enter them in my journal. The subject was the\r\nGulf Stream,—the stream itself this time, not the animals it carries\r\nalong with it. Mr. Agassiz’s late observations, though deeply\r\ninteresting to himself, inasmuch as personal confirmation of facts\r\nalready known is always satisfactory, have nothing novel now-a-days; yet\r\nthe history of the facts connected with the discovery of the Gulf\r\nStream, and their gradual development, is always attractive, and\r\nespecially so to Americans, on account of its direct connection with\r\nscientific investigations carried on under our government. Mr. Agassiz\r\ngave a slight sketch of this in opening his lecture. “It was Franklin\r\nwho first systematically observed these facts, though they had been\r\nnoticed long before by navigators. He recorded the temperature of the\r\nwater as he left the American continent for Europe, and found that it\r\ncontinued cold for a certain distance, then rose suddenly, and after a\r\ngiven time sank again to a lower temperature, though not so low as\r\nbefore. With the comprehensive grasp of mind characteristic of all his\r\nscientific results, he went at once beyond his facts. He inferred that\r\nthe warm current, keeping its way so steadily through the broad\r\nAtlantic, and carrying tropical productions to the northern shores of\r\nEurope, must take its rise in tropical regions, must be heated by a\r\ntropical sun.[4] This was his inference: to work it out, to ascertain\r\nthe origin and course of the Gulf Stream, has been, in a great degree,\r\nthe task of the United States Coast Survey, under the direction of his\r\ndescendant, Dr. Bache.”[5]\r\n\r\nWe are now fairly in the tropics. “The trades” blow heavily, and\r\nyesterday was a dreary day for those unused to the ocean; the beautiful\r\nblue water, of a peculiar metallic tint, as remarkable in color, it\r\nseemed to me, as the water of the Lake of Geneva, did not console us for\r\nthe heavy moral and physical depression of sea-sick mortals. To-day the\r\nworld looks brighter; there is a good deal of motion, but we are more\r\naccustomed to it. This morning the lecture had, for the first time, a\r\ndirect bearing upon the work of the expedition. The subject was, “How to\r\nobserve, and what are the objects of scientific explorations in modern\r\ntimes.”\r\n\r\n“My companions and myself have come together so suddenly and so\r\nunexpectedly on our present errand, that we have had little time to\r\norganize our work. The laying out of a general scheme of operations is,\r\ntherefore, the first and one of the most important points to be\r\ndiscussed between us. The time for great discoveries is passed. No\r\nstudent of nature goes out now expecting to find a new world, or looks\r\nin the heavens for any new theory of the solar system. The work of the\r\nnaturalist, in our day, is to explore worlds the existence of which is\r\nalready known; to investigate, not to discover. The first explorers, in\r\nthis modern sense, were Humboldt in the physical world, Cuvier in\r\nnatural history, Lavoisier in chemistry, La Place in astronomy. They\r\nhave been the pioneers in the kind of scientific work characteristic of\r\nour century. We who have chosen Brazil as our field must seek to make\r\nourselves familiar with its physical features, its mountains and its\r\nrivers, its animals and plants. There is a change, however, to be\r\nintroduced in our mode of work, as compared with that of former\r\ninvestigators. When less was known of animals and plants the discovery\r\nof new species was the great object. This has been carried too far, and\r\nis now almost the lowest kind of scientific work. The discovery of a new\r\nspecies as such does not change a feature in the science of natural\r\nhistory, any more than the discovery of a new asteroid changes the\r\ncharacter of the problems to be investigated by astronomers. It is\r\nmerely adding to the enumeration of objects. We should look rather for\r\nthe fundamental relations among animals; the number of species we may\r\nfind is of importance only so far as they explain the distribution and\r\nlimitation of different genera and families, their relations to each\r\nother and to the physical conditions under which they live. Out of such\r\ninvestigations there looms up a deeper question for scientific men, the\r\nsolution of which is to be the most important result of their work in\r\ncoming generations. The origin of life is the great question of the day.\r\nHow did the organic world come to be as it is? It must be our aim to\r\nthrow some light on this subject by our present journey. How did Brazil\r\ncome to be inhabited by the animals and plants now living there? Who\r\nwere its inhabitants in past times? What reason is there to believe that\r\nthe present condition of things in this country is in any sense derived\r\nfrom the past? The first step in this investigation must be to ascertain\r\nthe geographical distribution of the present animals and plants. Suppose\r\nwe first examine the Rio San Francisco. The basin of this river is\r\nentirely isolated. Are its inhabitants, like its waters, completely\r\ndistinct from those of other basins? Are its species peculiar to itself,\r\nand not repeated in any other river of the continent? Extraordinary as\r\nthis result would seem, I nevertheless expect to find it so. The next\r\nwater-basin we shall have to examine will be that of the Amazons, which\r\nconnects through the Rio Negro with the Orinoco. It has been frequently\r\nrepeated that the same species of fish exist in the waters of the San\r\nFrancisco and in those of Guiana and of the Amazons. At all events, our\r\nworks on fishes constantly indicate Brazil and Guiana as the common home\r\nof many species; but this observation has never been made with\r\nsufficient accuracy to merit confidence. Fifty years ago the exact\r\nlocality from which any animal came seemed an unimportant fact in its\r\nscientific history, for the bearing of this question on that of origin\r\nwas not then perceived. To say that any specimen came from South America\r\nwas quite enough; to specify that it came from Brazil, from the Amazons,\r\nthe San Francisco, or the La Plata, seemed a marvellous accuracy in the\r\nobservers. In the museum at Paris, for instance, there are many\r\nspecimens entered as coming from New York or from Pará; but all that is\r\nabsolutely known about them is that they were shipped from those\r\nsea-ports. Nobody knows exactly where they were collected. So there are\r\nspecimens entered as coming from the Rio San Francisco, but it is by no\r\nmeans sure that they came exclusively from that water-basin. All this\r\nkind of investigation is far too loose for our present object. Our work\r\nmust be done with much more precision; it must tell something positive\r\nof the geographical distribution of animals in Brazil. Therefore, my\r\nyoung friends who come with me on this expedition, let us be careful\r\nthat every specimen has a label, recording locality and date, so secured\r\nthat it shall reach Cambridge safely. It would be still better to attach\r\ntwo labels to each specimen, so that, if any mischance happens to one,\r\nour record may not be lost. We must try not to mix the fishes of\r\ndifferent rivers, even though they flow into each other, but to keep our\r\ncollections perfectly distinct. You will easily see the vast importance\r\nof thus ascertaining the limitation of species, and the bearing of the\r\nresult on the great question of origin.\r\n\r\n“Something is already known. It is ascertained that the South American\r\nrivers possess some fishes peculiar to them. Were these fishes then\r\ncreated in these separate water-systems as they now exist, or have they\r\nbeen transferred thither from some other water-bed? If not born there,\r\nhow did they come there? Is there, or has there ever been, any possible\r\nconnection between these water-systems? Are their characteristic species\r\nrepeated elsewhere? Thus we narrow the boundaries of the investigation,\r\nand bring it, by successive approaches, nearer the ultimate question.\r\nBut the first inquiry is, How far are species distinct all over the\r\nworld, and what are their limits? Till this is ascertained, all theories\r\nabout their origin, their derivation from one another, their successive\r\ntransformation, their migration from given centres, and so on, are mere\r\nbeating about the bush. I allude especially to the fresh-water fishes,\r\nin connection with this investigation, on account of the precision of\r\ntheir boundaries. Looking at the matter theoretically, without a\r\npositive investigation, I do not expect to find a single species of the\r\nLower Amazons above Tabatinga.[6] I base this supposition upon my own\r\nobservations respecting the distribution of species in the European\r\nrivers. I have found that, while some species occur simultaneously in\r\nthe many upper water-courses which combine to form the Rhine, the Rhone,\r\nand the Danube, most of them are not found in the lower course of these\r\nrivers; that, again, certain species are found in two of these\r\nwater-basins and do not occur in the third, or inhabit only one and are\r\nnot to be met in the two others. The brook trout, for instance (_Salmo\r\nFario_), is common to the upper course and the higher tributaries of all\r\nthe three river-systems, but does not inhabit the main bed of their\r\nlower course. So it is, also, and in a more striking degree, with the\r\nSalmling (_Salmo Salvelinus_). The Huchen (_Salmo Hucho_) is only found\r\nin the Danube. But the distribution of the perch family in these rivers\r\nis, perhaps, the most remarkable. The Zingel (_Aspro Zingel_) and the\r\nSchrætzer (_Acerina Schrætzer_) are only found in the Danube; while\r\n_Acerina cernua_ is found in the Danube as well as in the Rhine, but not\r\nin the Rhone; and _Aspro asper_ in the Danube as well as in the Rhone,\r\nbut not in the Rhine. The Sander (_Lucioperca Sandra_) is found in the\r\nDanube and the other large rivers of Eastern Europe, but occurs neither\r\nin the Rhine nor in the Rhone. The common perch (_Perca fluviatilis_),\r\non the contrary, is found both in the Rhine and Rhone, but not in the\r\nDanube, which, however, nourishes another species of true Perca, already\r\ndescribed by Schaeffer as _Perca vulgaris_. Again, the pickerel (_Esox\r\nLucius_) is common to all these rivers, especially in their lower\r\ncourse, and so is also the cusk (_Lota vulgaris_). The special\r\ndistribution of the carp family would afford many other striking\r\nexamples, but they are too numerous and too little known to be used as\r\nan illustration here.\r\n\r\n“This is among the most remarkable instances of what I would call the\r\narbitrary character of geographical distribution. Such facts cannot be\r\nexplained by any theory of accidental dispersion, for the upper mountain\r\nrivulets, in which these great rivers take their rise, have no\r\nconnection with each other; nor can any local circumstance explain the\r\npresence of some species in all the three basins, while others appear\r\nonly in one, or perhaps in two, and are absent from the third, or the\r\nfact that certain species inhabiting the head-waters of these streams\r\nare never found in their lower course when the descent would seem so\r\nnatural and so easy. In the absence of any positive explanation, we are\r\nleft to assume that the distribution of animal life has primary laws as\r\ndefinite and precise as those which govern anything else in the system\r\nof the universe.\r\n\r\n“It is for the sake of investigations of this kind that I wish our party\r\nto divide, in order that we may cover as wide a ground as possible, and\r\ncompare a greater number of the water-basins of Brazil. I wish the same\r\nto be done, as far as may be, for all the classes of Vertebrates, as\r\nwell as for Mollusks, Articulates, and Radiates. As we have no special\r\nbotanist in the party, we must be content to make a methodical\r\ncollection of the most characteristic families of trees, such as the\r\npalms and tree ferns. A collection of the stems of these trees would be\r\nespecially important as a guide to the identification of fossil woods.\r\nMuch more is known of the geographical distribution of plants than of\r\nanimals, however, and there is, therefore, less to be done that is new\r\nin that direction.\r\n\r\n“Our next aim, and with the same object, namely, its bearing upon the\r\nquestion of origin, will be the study of the young, the collecting of\r\neggs and embryos. This is the more important, since museums generally\r\nshow only adult specimens. As far as I know, the Zoölogical Museum at\r\nCambridge is the only one containing large collections of embryological\r\nspecimens from all the classes of the animal kingdom. One significant\r\nfact, however, is already known. In their earliest stages of growth all\r\nanimals of the same class are much more alike than in their adult\r\ncondition, and sometimes so nearly alike as hardly to be distinguished.\r\nIndeed, there is an early period when the resemblances greatly outweigh\r\nthe differences. How far the representatives of different classes\r\nresemble one another remains to be ascertained with precision. There are\r\ntwo possible interpretations of these facts. One is that animals so\r\nnearly identical in the beginning must have been originally derived from\r\none germ, and are but modifications or transmutations, under various\r\nphysical conditions, of this primitive unit. The other interpretation,\r\nfounded on the same facts, is, that since, notwithstanding this material\r\nidentity in the beginning, no germ ever grows to be different from its\r\nparent, or diverges from the pattern imposed upon it at its birth,\r\ntherefore some other cause besides a material one must control its\r\ndevelopment; and if this be so, we have to seek an explanation of the\r\ndifferences between animals outside of physical influences. Thus far\r\nboth these views rest chiefly upon personal convictions and opinions.\r\nThe true solution of the problem must be sought in the study of the\r\ndevelopment of the animals themselves, and embryology is still in its\r\ninfancy; for, though a very complete study of the embryology of a few\r\nanimals has been made, yet these investigations include so small a\r\nnumber of representatives from the different classes of the animal\r\nkingdom that they do not yet give a basis for broad generalizations.\r\nVery little is known of the earlier stages in the formation of hosts of\r\ninsects whose later metamorphoses, including the change of the already\r\nadvanced larva, first to the condition of a chrysalis and then to that\r\nof a perfect insect, have been carefully traced. It remains to be\r\nascertained to what extent the caterpillars of different kinds of\r\nbutterflies, for instance, resemble one another during the time of their\r\nformation in the egg. An immense field of observation is open in this\r\norder alone.\r\n\r\n“I have, myself, examined over one hundred species of bird embryos, now\r\nput up in the museum of Cambridge, and found that, at a certain age,\r\nthey all have bills, wings, legs, feet, &c., &c. exactly alike. The\r\nyoung robin and the young crow are web-footed, as well as the duck. It\r\nis only later that the fingers of the foot become distinct. How very\r\ninteresting it will be to continue this investigation among the tropical\r\nbirds!—to see whether, for instance, the toucan, with its gigantic bill,\r\nhas, at a certain age, a bill like that of all other birds; whether the\r\nspoonbill ibis has, at the same age, nothing characteristic in the shape\r\nof its bill. No living naturalist could now tell you one word about all\r\nthis; neither could he give you any information about corresponding\r\nfacts in the growth of the fishes, reptiles, or quadrupeds of Brazil,\r\nnot one of the young of these animals having ever been compared with the\r\nadult. In these lectures I only aim at showing you what an extensive and\r\ninteresting field of investigation opens before us; if we succeed in\r\ncultivating even a few corners of it we shall be fortunate.”\r\n\r\nIn the evening, which is always the most enjoyable part of our day, we\r\nsat on the guards and watched the first tropical sunset we had yet seen.\r\nThe sun went down in purple and gold, and, after its departure, sent\r\nback a glow that crimsoned the clouds almost to the zenith, dying off to\r\npaler rose tints on the edges, while heavy masses of gray vapor, just\r\nbeginning to be silvered by the moon, swept up from the south.\r\n\r\n_April 7th._—To-day the lecture was upon the physical features of South\r\nAmerica, something with reference to the geological and geographical\r\nwork in which Mr. Agassiz hopes to have efficient aid from his younger\r\nassistants. So much of the lecture consisted of explanations given upon\r\ngeological maps that it is difficult to record it. Its principal object,\r\nhowever, was to show in what direction they should work in order to give\r\ngreater precision to the general information already secured respecting\r\nthe formation of the continent. “The basin of the Amazons, for instance,\r\nis a level plain. The whole of it is covered with loose materials. We\r\nmust watch carefully the character of these loose materials, and try to\r\ntrack them to their origin. As there are very characteristic rocks in\r\nvarious parts of this plain, we shall have a clew to the nature of at\r\nleast some portion of these materials. My own previous studies have\r\ngiven me a special interest in certain questions connected with these\r\nfacts. What power has ground up these loose materials? Are they the\r\nresult of disintegration of the rock by ordinary atmospheric agents, or\r\nare they caused by the action of water, or by that of glaciers? Was\r\nthere ever a time when large masses of ice descended far lower than the\r\npresent snow line of the Andes, and, moving over the low lands, ground\r\nthese materials to powder? We know that such an agency has been at work\r\non the northern half of this hemisphere. We have now to look for its\r\ntraces on the southern half, where no such investigations have ever been\r\nmade within its warm latitudes; though to Darwin science is already\r\nindebted for much valuable information concerning the glacial phenomena\r\nof the temperate and colder portions of the South American continent. We\r\nshould examine the loose materials in every river we ascend, and see\r\nwhat relation they bear to the dry land above. The color of the water in\r\nconnection with the nature of the banks will tell us something. The\r\nwaters of the Rio Branco, for instance, are said to be milky white;\r\nthose of the Rio Negro, black. In the latter case the color is probably\r\nowing to the decomposition of vegetation. I would advise each one of our\r\nparties to pass a large amount of water from any river or stream along\r\nwhich they travel through a filter, and to examine the deposit\r\nmicroscopically. They will thus ascertain the character of the detritus,\r\nwhether from sand, or lime, or granite, or mere river mud formed by the\r\ndecomposition of organic matter. Even the smaller streams and rivulets\r\nwill have their peculiar character. The Brazilian table-land rises to a\r\nbroad ridge running from west to east, and determining the direction of\r\nthe rivers. It is usually represented as a mountain range, but is in\r\nfact nothing but a high flat ridge serving as a water-shed, and cut\r\ntransversely by deep fissures in which the rivers flow. These fissures\r\nare broad in their lower parts, but little is known of their upper\r\nrange; and whoever will examine their banks carefully will do an\r\nimportant work for science. Indeed, very little is known accurately of\r\nthe geology of Brazil. On the geological maps almost the whole country\r\nis represented as consisting of granite. If this be correct, it is very\r\ninconsistent with what we know of the geological structure of other\r\ncontinents, where the stratified rocks are in much larger proportions.”\r\n\r\nUpon this followed some account of the different kinds of valley\r\nformation and of terraces. “Do the old terraces above the rivers of\r\nSouth America correspond to the river terraces on any of our\r\nrivers,—those of the Connecticut, for instance,—showing that their\r\nwaters had formerly a much greater depth and covered a much wider\r\nbottom? There must of course have been a cause for this great\r\naccumulation of water in ancient periods. I account for it in the\r\nnorthern half of the hemisphere by the melting of vast masses of ice in\r\nthe glacial period, causing immense freshets. There is no trustworthy\r\naccount of the river terraces in Brazil. Bates, however, describes\r\nflat-topped hills between Santarem and Pará in the narrow part of the\r\nvalley, near Almeyrim, rising 800 feet above the present level of the\r\nAmazons. If this part of the valley were flooded in old times, banks\r\nmight have been formed of which these hills are a remnant. But because\r\nsuch a theory might account for the facts it does not follow that the\r\ntheory is true. Our work must be to study the facts, to see, among other\r\nthings, of what these hills are built, whether of rock or of loose\r\nmaterials. No one has told us anything as yet of their geological\r\nconstitution.”[7]\r\n\r\nTo-day we have seen numbers of flying-fish from the deck, and were\r\nastonished at the grace and beauty of their motion, which we had\r\nsupposed to be rather a leap than actual flight. And flight indeed it is\r\nnot, their pectoral fins acting as sails rather than wings, and carrying\r\nthem along on the wind. They skim over the water in this way to a great\r\ndistance. Captain Bradbury told us he had followed one with his glass\r\nand lost sight of it at a considerable distance, without seeing it dip\r\ninto the water again. Mr. Agassiz has great delight in watching them.[8]\r\nHaving never before sailed in tropical seas, he enjoys every day some\r\nnew pleasure.\r\n\r\n_April 9th._—Yesterday Mr. Agassiz lectured upon the traces of glaciers\r\nas they exist in the northern hemisphere, and the signs of the same kind\r\nto be sought for in Brazil. After a sketch of what has been done in\r\nglacial investigation in Europe and the United States, showing the great\r\nextension of ice over these regions in ancient times, he continued as\r\nfollows: “When the polar half of both hemispheres was covered by such an\r\nice shroud, the climate of the whole earth must have been different from\r\nwhat it is now. The limits of the ancient glaciers give us some estimate\r\nof this difference, though of course only an approximate one. A degree\r\nof temperature in the annual average of any given locality corresponds\r\nto a degree of latitude; that is, a degree of temperature is lost for\r\nevery degree of latitude as we travel northward, or gained for every\r\ndegree of latitude as we travel southward. In our times, the line at\r\nwhich the average annual temperature is 32°, that is, at which glaciers\r\nmay be formed, is in latitude 60° or thereabouts, the latitude of\r\nGreenland; while the height at which they may originate in latitude 45°\r\nis about 6,000 feet. If it appear that the ancient southern limit of\r\nglaciers is in latitude 36°, we must admit that in those days the\r\npresent climate of Greenland extended to that line. Such a change of\r\nclimate with reference to latitude must have been attended by a\r\ncorresponding change of climate with reference to altitude. Three\r\ndegrees of temperature correspond to about one thousand feet of\r\naltitude. If, therefore, it is found that the ancient limit of glacier\r\naction descends on the Andes, for instance, to 7,000 feet above the\r\nlevel of the sea under the equator, the present line of perpetual snow\r\nbeing at 15,000, it is safe to infer that in those days the climate was\r\nsome 24° or thereabouts below its present temperature. That is, the\r\ntemperature of the present snow line then prevailed at a height of 7,000\r\nfeet above the sea level, as the present average temperature of\r\nGreenland then prevailed in latitude 36°. I am as confident that we\r\nshall find these indications at about the limit I have pointed out as if\r\nI had already seen them. I would even venture to prophesy that the first\r\nmoraines in the valley of the Marañon should be found where it bends\r\neastward above Jaen.”[9]\r\n\r\nAlthough the weather is fine, the motion of the ship continues to be so\r\ngreat that those of us who have not what are popularly called\r\n“sea-legs,” have much ado to keep our balance. For my own part, I am\r\nbeginning to feel a personal animosity to “the trades.” I had imagined\r\nthem to be soft, genial breezes wafting us gently southward; instead of\r\nwhich they blow dead ahead all the time, and give us no rest night or\r\nday. And yet we are very unreasonable to grumble; for never were greater\r\ncomforts and conveniences provided for voyagers on the great deep than\r\nare to be found on this magnificent ship. The state-rooms large and\r\ncommodious, parlor and dining-hall well ventilated, cool, and cheerful,\r\nthe decks long and broad enough to give a chance for extensive\r\n“constitutionals” to everybody who can stand upright for two minutes\r\ntogether, the attendance punctual and admirable in every respect; in\r\nshort, nothing is left to be desired except a little more stable\r\nfooting.\r\n\r\n_April 10th._—A rough sea to-day, notwithstanding which we had our\r\nlecture as usual, though I must say, that, owing to the lurching of the\r\nship, the lecturer pitched about more than was consistent with the\r\ndignity of science. Mr. Agassiz returned to the subject of embryology,\r\nurging upon his assistants the importance of collecting materials for\r\nthis object as a means of obtaining an insight into the deeper relations\r\nbetween animals.\r\n\r\n“Heretofore classification has been arbitrary, inasmuch as it has rested\r\nmainly upon the interpretation given to structural differences by\r\nvarious observers, who did not measure the character and value of these\r\ndifferences by any natural standard. I believe that we have a more\r\ncertain guide in these matters than opinion or the individual estimate\r\nof any observer, however keen his insight into structural differences.\r\nThe true principle of classification exists in Nature herself, and we\r\nhave only to decipher it. If this conviction be correct, the next\r\nquestion is, How can we make this principle a practical one in our\r\nlaboratories, an active stimulus in our investigations? Is it\r\nsusceptible of positive demonstration in material facts? Is there any\r\nmethod to be adopted as a correct guide, if we set aside the idea of\r\noriginating systems of classification of our own, and seek only to read\r\nthat already written in nature? I answer, Yes. The standard is to be\r\nfound in the changes animals undergo from their first formation in the\r\negg to their adult condition.\r\n\r\n“It would be impossible for me here and now to give you the details of\r\nthis method of investigation, but I can tell you enough to illustrate my\r\nstatement. Take a homely and very familiar example, that of the branch\r\nof Articulates. Naturalists divide this branch into three\r\nclasses,—Insects, Crustacea, and Worms; and most of them tell you that\r\nWorms are lowest, Crustacea next in rank, and that Insects stand\r\nhighest, while others have placed the Crustacea at the head of the\r\ngroup. We may well ask why. Why does an insect stand above a crustacean,\r\nor, _vice versa_, why is a grasshopper or a butterfly structurally\r\nsuperior to a lobster or a shrimp? And indeed there must be a difference\r\nin opinion as to the respective standing of these groups so long as\r\ntheir classification is allowed to remain a purely arbitrary one, based\r\nonly upon interpretation of anatomical details. One man thinks the\r\nstructural features of Insects superior, and places them highest;\r\nanother thinks the structural features of the Crustacea highest, and\r\nplaces them at the head. In either case it is only a question of\r\nindividual appreciation of the facts. But when we study the gradual\r\ndevelopment of the insect, and find that in its earliest stages it is\r\nworm-like, in its second, or chrysalis stage, it is crustacean-like, and\r\nonly in its final completion it assumes the character of a perfect\r\ninsect, we have a simple natural scale by which to estimate the\r\ncomparative rank of these animals. Since we cannot suppose that there is\r\na retrograde movement in the development of any animal, we must believe\r\nthat the insect stands highest, and our classification in this instance\r\nis dictated by Nature herself. This is one of the most striking\r\nexamples, but there are others quite as much so, though not as familiar.\r\nThe frog, for instance, in its successive stages of development,\r\nillustrates the comparative standing of the orders composing the class\r\nto which it belongs. These orders are differently classified by various\r\nnaturalists, according to their individual estimate of their structural\r\nfeatures. But the growth of the frog, like that of the insects, gives us\r\nthe true grade of the type.[10] There are not many groups in which this\r\ncomparison has been carried out so fully as in the insects and frogs;\r\nbut wherever it has been tried it is found to be a perfectly sure test.\r\nOccasional glimpses of these facts, seen disconnectedly, have done much\r\nto confirm the development theory, so greatly in vogue at present,\r\nthough under a somewhat new form. Those who sustain these views have\r\nseen that there was a gradation between animals, and have inferred that\r\nit was a material connection. But when we follow it in the growth of the\r\nanimals themselves, and find that, close as it is, no animal ever misses\r\nits true development, or grows to be anything but what it was meant to\r\nbe, we are forced to admit that the gradation which unquestionably\r\nunites all animals is an intellectual, not a material one. It exists in\r\nthe Mind which made them. As the works of a human intellect are bound\r\ntogether by mental kinship, so are the thoughts of the Creator\r\nspiritually united. I think that considerations like these should be an\r\ninducement for us all to collect the young of as many animals as\r\npossible on this journey. In so doing we may change the fundamental\r\nprinciples of classification, and confer a lasting benefit on science.\r\n\r\n“It is very important to select the right animals for such\r\ninvestigations. I can conceive that a lifetime should be passed in\r\nembryological studies, and yet little be learned of the principles of\r\nclassification. The embryology of the worm, for instance, would not give\r\nus the natural classification of the Articulates, because we should see\r\nonly the first step of the series; we should not reach the sequence of\r\nthe development. It would be like reading over and over again the first\r\nchapter of a story. The embryology of the Insects, on the contrary,\r\nwould give us the whole succession of a scale on the lowest level of\r\nwhich the Worms remain forever. So the embryology of the frog will give\r\nus the classification of the group to which it belongs, but the\r\nembryology of the Cecilia, the lowest order in the group, will give us\r\nonly the initiatory steps. In the same way the naturalist who, in\r\nstudying the embryology of the reptiles, should begin with their lowest\r\nrepresentatives, the serpents, would make a great mistake. But take the\r\nalligator, so abundant in the regions to which we are going. An\r\nalligator’s egg in the earliest condition of growth has never been\r\nopened by a naturalist. The young have been occasionally taken from the\r\negg just before hatching, but absolutely nothing is known of their first\r\nphases of development. A complete embryology of the alligator would give\r\nus not only the natural classification of reptiles as they exist now,\r\nbut might teach us something of their history from the time of their\r\nintroduction upon earth to the present day. For embryology shows us not\r\nonly the relations of existing animals to each other, but their\r\nrelations to extinct types also. One prominent result of embryological\r\nstudies has been to show that animals in the earlier stages of their\r\ngrowth resemble ancient representatives of the same type belonging to\r\npast geological ages. The first reptiles were introduced in the\r\ncarboniferous epoch, and they were very different from those now\r\nexisting. They were not numerous at that period; but later in the\r\nworld’s history there was a time, justly called the ‘age of reptiles,’\r\nwhen the gigantic Saurians, Plesiosaurians, and Ichthyosaurians\r\nabounded. I believe, and my conviction is drawn from my previous\r\nembryological studies, that the changes of the alligator in the egg will\r\ngive us the clew to the structural relations of the Reptiles from their\r\nfirst creation to the present day,—will give us, in other words, their\r\nsequence in time as well as their sequence in growth. In the class of\r\nReptiles, then, the most instructive group we can select with reference\r\nto the structural relations of the type as it now exists, and their\r\nhistory in past times, will be the alligator. We must therefore neglect\r\nno opportunity of collecting their eggs in as large numbers as possible.\r\n\r\n“There are other animals in Brazil, low in their class to be sure, but\r\nyet very important to study embryologically, on account of their\r\nrelation to extinct types. These are the sloths and armadillos,—animals\r\nof insignificant size in our days, but anciently represented in gigantic\r\nproportions. The Megatherium, the Mylodon, the Megalonyx, were some of\r\nthese immense Mammalia. I believe that the embryonic changes of the\r\nsloths and armadillos will explain the structural relations of those\r\nhuge Edentata and their connection with the present ones. South America\r\nteems with the fossil bones of these animals, which indeed penetrated\r\ninto the northern half of the hemisphere as high up as Georgia and\r\nKentucky, where their remains have been found. The living\r\nrepresentatives of the family are also numerous in South America, and we\r\nshould make it one of our chief objects to get specimens of all ages and\r\nexamine them from their earliest phases upward. We must, above all, try\r\nnot to be led away from the more important aims of our study by the\r\ndiversity of objects. I have known many young naturalists to miss the\r\nhighest success by trying to cover too much ground,—by becoming\r\ncollectors rather than investigators. Bitten by the mania for amassing a\r\ngreat number and variety of species, such a man never returns to the\r\ngeneral consideration of more comprehensive features. We must try to set\r\nbefore ourselves certain important questions, and give ourselves\r\nresolutely to the investigation of these points, even though we should\r\nsacrifice less important things more readily reached.\r\n\r\n“Another type full of interest, from an embryological point of view,\r\nwill be the Monkeys. Since some of our scientific colleagues look upon\r\nthem as our ancestors, it is important that we should collect as many\r\nfacts as possible concerning their growth. Of course it would be better\r\nif we could make the investigation in the land of the Orangs, Gorillas,\r\nand Chimpanzees,—the highest monkeys and the nearest to man in their\r\ndevelopment. Still even the process of growth in the South American\r\nmonkey will be very instructive. Give a mathematician the initial\r\nelements of a series, and he will work out the whole; and so I believe\r\nwhen the laws of embryological development are better understood,\r\nnaturalists will have a key to the limits of these cycles of growth, and\r\nbe able to appoint them their natural boundaries even from partial data.\r\n\r\n“Next in importance I would place the Tapirs. This is one of a family\r\nwhose geological antecedents are very important and interesting. The\r\nMastodons, the Palæotherium, the Dinotherium, and other large Mammalia\r\nof the Tertiaries, are closely related to the Tapir. The elephant,\r\nrhinoceros, and the like, are of the same family. From its structural\r\nstanding next to the elephant, which is placed highest in the group, the\r\nembryology of the Tapir would give us a very complete series of changes.\r\nIt would seem from some of the fossil remains of this family that the\r\nPachyderms were formerly more nearly related to the Ruminants and\r\nRodents than they now are. Therefore it would be well to study the\r\nembryology of the Capivari, the Paca, and the Peccary, in connection\r\nwith that of the Tapir. Lastly, it will be important to learn something\r\nof the embryology of the Manatee or Sea-Cow of the Amazons. It is\r\nsomething like a porpoise in outline, and seems to be the modern\r\nrepresentative of the ancient Dinotherium.”\r\n\r\n_April 12th._—The lecture to-day was addressed especially to the\r\nornithologists of the party, its object being to show how the same\r\nmethod of study,—that of testing the classification by the phases of\r\ngrowth in the different groups,—might be applied to the birds as\r\nprofitably as to other types.\r\n\r\nWe have made good progress in the last forty-eight hours, and are fast\r\nleaving our friends “the trades” behind. The captain promises us smooth\r\nwaters in a day or two. With the dying away of the wind will come\r\ngreater heat, but as yet we have had no intensely warm weather. The sun,\r\nhowever, keeps us within doors a great part of the day, but in the\r\nevening we sit on the guards, watch the sunset over the waters, and then\r\nthe moonlight, and so while away the time till nine or ten o’clock, when\r\none by one the party disperses. The sea has been so rough that we have\r\nnot been able to capture anything, but when we get into smoother waters,\r\nour naturalists will be on the look out for jelly-fish, argonautas, and\r\nthe like.\r\n\r\n_April 13th._—In to-day’s lecture Mr. Agassiz returned again to the\r\nsubject of geographical distribution and the importance of localizing\r\nthe collections with great precision.\r\n\r\n“As Rio de Janeiro is our starting-point, the water-system in its\r\nimmediate neighborhood will be as it were a schoolroom for us during the\r\nfirst week of our Brazilian life. We shall not find it so easy a matter\r\nas it seems to keep our collections distinct in this region. The\r\nhead-waters of some of the rivers near Rio, flowing in opposite\r\ndirections, are in such close proximity that it will be difficult\r\nsometimes to distinguish them. Outside of the coast range, to which the\r\nOrgan Mountains belong, are a number of short streams, little rills, so\r\nto speak, emptying directly into the ocean. It will be important to\r\nascertain whether the same animals occur in all these short\r\nwater-courses. I think this will be found to be the case, because it is\r\nso with corresponding small rivers on our northern coast. There are\r\nlittle rivers along the whole coast from Maine to New Jersey; all these\r\ndisconnected rivers contain a similar fauna. There is another extensive\r\nrange inland of the coast ridge, the Serra de Mantiquera, sloping gently\r\ndown to the ocean south of the Rio Belmonte or Jequitinhonha. Rivers\r\narising in this range are more complex; they have large tributaries.\r\nTheir upper part is usually broken by waterfalls, their lower course\r\nbeing more level; probably in the lower courses of these rivers we shall\r\nfind fishes similar to those of the short coast streams, while in the\r\nhigher broken waters we shall find distinct faunæ.” The lecture closed\r\nwith some account of the excursions likely to be undertaken in the\r\nneighborhood of Rio de Janeiro on arriving, and with some practical\r\ninstructions about collecting, based upon Mr. Agassiz’s personal\r\nexperience.[11]\r\n\r\n_April 14th._—Last evening was the most beautiful we have had since we\r\nleft home; perfectly clear with the exception of soft white masses of\r\ncloud on the horizon, all their edges silvered by the moonlight. We\r\nlooked our last for many months to come on the north star, and saw the\r\nsouthern cross for the first time. With the visible image I lost a far\r\nmore wonderful constellation which had lived in my imagination; it has\r\nvanished with all its golden glory, a celestial vision as amazing as\r\nthat which converted Constantine, and in its place stands the veritable\r\nconstellation with its four little points of light.\r\n\r\nThe lecture to-day was upon the fishes of South America. “I will give\r\nyou this morning a slight sketch of the characteristic fishes in South\r\nAmerica, as compared with those of the Old World and North America.\r\nThough I do not know how the fishes are distributed in the regions to\r\nwhich we are going, and it is just upon the investigation of this point\r\nthat I want your help, I know their character as distinguished from\r\nthose of other continents. We must remember that the most important aim\r\nof all our studies in this direction will be the solution of the\r\nquestion whether any given fauna is distinct and has originated where it\r\nnow exists. To this end I shall make you acquainted with the Brazilian\r\nanimals so far as I can in the short time we have before beginning our\r\nactive operations, in order that you may be prepared to detect the law\r\nof their geographical distribution. I shall speak to-day more especially\r\nof the fresh-water fishes.\r\n\r\n“In the northern hemisphere there is a remarkable group of fishes known\r\nas the Sturgeons. They are chiefly found in the waters flowing into the\r\nPolar seas, as the Mackenzie River on our own continent, the Lena and\r\nYenissei in the Old World, and in all the rivers and lakes of the\r\ntemperate zone, communicating with the Atlantic Ocean. They occur in\r\nsmaller numbers in most tributaries of the Mediterranean, but are common\r\nin the Volga and Danube, as well as in the Mississippi, in some of the\r\nrivers on our northern Atlantic and Pacific coasts, and in China. This\r\nfamily has no representatives in Africa, Southern Asia, Australia, or\r\nSouth America, but there is a group corresponding in a certain way to it\r\nin South America,—that of the Goniodonts. Though some ichthyologists\r\nplace them widely apart in their classifications, there is, on the\r\nwhole, a striking resemblance between the Sturgeons and Goniodonts.\r\nGroups of this kind, reproducing certain features common to both, but\r\ndiffering by special structural modifications, are called\r\n‘representative types.’ This name applies more especially to such groups\r\nwhen they are distributed over different parts of the world. To\r\nnaturalists the comparison of one of these types with another is very\r\ninteresting, as touching upon the question of origin of species. To\r\nthose who believe that animals are derived from one another the\r\nalternative here presented is very clear: either one of these groups\r\ngrew out of the other, or else they both had common ancestors which were\r\nneither Sturgeons nor Goniodonts, but combined the features of both and\r\ngave birth to each.\r\n\r\n“There is a third family of fishes, the Hornpouts or Bullheads, called\r\nSiluroids by naturalists, which seem by their structural character to\r\noccupy an intermediate position between the Sturgeons and Goniodonts.\r\nThere would seem to be, then, in these three groups, so similar in\r\ncertain features, so distinct in others, the elements of a series. But\r\nwhile their structural relations suggest a common origin, their\r\ngeographical distribution seems to exclude it. Take, for instance, the\r\nHornpouts; they are very few in the northern hemisphere, hardly ever\r\noccurring in those rivers where the Sturgeons abound, and they are very\r\nnumerous in the southern hemisphere, in southern Asia, Australia,\r\nAfrica, and South America, where the Sturgeons are altogether wanting.\r\nIn South America the Siluroids everywhere exist with the Goniodonts, in\r\nall other parts of the world without them; the Goniodonts being only\r\nfound in South America. If these were the ancestors of the Siluroids in\r\nSouth America, they were certainly not their ancestors anywhere else. If\r\nthe Sturgeons were the ancestors of the Siluroids and of the Goniodonts,\r\nit is strange that their progeny should consist of these two families in\r\nSouth America, and in the Old World of the Siluroids only. But if all\r\nthree had some other common ancestry, it would be still more\r\nextraordinary that its progeny should exhibit so specific a distribution\r\nupon the surface of our globe. The Siluroids lay very large eggs, and as\r\nthey are very abundant in South America we shall no doubt have\r\nopportunities of collecting them. Of the reproduction of the Goniodonts\r\nabsolutely nothing is known. Of course the embryology of both these\r\ngroups would have a direct bearing on the problem of their origin.\r\n\r\n“Another family very abundant in various parts of the world is that of\r\nthe Perches. They are found all over North America, Europe, and Northern\r\nAsia; but there is not one to be found in the fresh waters of the\r\nsouthern hemisphere. In South America and in Africa they are represented\r\nhowever by a very similar group, that of the Chromids. These two groups\r\nare so much akin that from their structure it would seem natural to\r\nsuppose that the Chromids were transformed Perches; the more so, since\r\nin the western hemisphere the latter extend from the high north to\r\nTexas, south of which they are represented by the Chromids. Here the\r\ngeographical as well as the structural transition would seem an easy\r\none. But look at the eastern hemisphere. Perches abound in Asia, Europe,\r\nand Australia, but there are no Chromids there. How is it that the\r\nPerches of this continent have been so fertile in producing Chromids,\r\nand the Perches of all other continents, except Africa, absolutely\r\nsterile in this respect? Or if we reverse the proposition, and suppose\r\nthe Perches to have grown out of the Chromids, why have their ancestry\r\ndisappeared so completely on the Asiatic side of the world, while they\r\ndo not seem to have diminished on this? And if Perches and Chromids\r\nshould be represented as descending from an older common type, I would\r\nanswer that Palæontology knows nothing of such a pedigree.\r\n\r\n“Next come the Chubs, or in scientific nomenclature the Cyprinoids.\r\nThese fishes, variously called Chubs, Suckers, or Carps, abound in all\r\nthe fresh waters of the northern hemisphere. They are also numerous in\r\nthe eastern part of the southern hemisphere, but have not a single\r\nrepresentative in South America. As the Goniodonts are characteristic of\r\nthe southern hemisphere in its western half, so this group seems to be\r\ncharacteristic of it in its eastern half. But while the Cyprinoids have\r\nno representative in South America, there is another group there,\r\nstructurally akin to them, called the Cyprinodonts. They are all\r\nsmall-sized; our Minnows belong to this group. From Maine to Texas they\r\nare found in all the short rivers or creeks all along the coast. It is\r\nfor this reason that I expect to find the short coast rivers of South\r\nAmerica abounding in Minnows. I remember to have found in the\r\nneighborhood of Mobile no less than six new species in the course of an\r\nafternoon’s ramble. These fishes are almost all viviparous, or at least\r\nlay their eggs in a very advanced state of development of the young. The\r\nsexes differ so greatly in appearance that they have sometimes been\r\ndescribed as distinct species, nay, even as distinct genera.[12] We must\r\nbe on our guard against a similar mistake. Here again we have two\r\ngroups, the Cyprinoids and Cyprinodonts, so similar in their structural\r\nfeatures that the development of one out of the other naturally suggests\r\nitself. But in South America there are no Cyprinoids at all, while the\r\nCyprinodonts abound; in Europe, Asia, and North America on the contrary,\r\nthe Cyprinoids are very numerous and the Cyprinodonts comparatively\r\nfew.” The Characines were next considered with reference to their\r\naffinities as well as their geographical distribution; and a few remarks\r\nwere added upon the smaller families known to have representatives in\r\nthe fresh waters of South America, such as the Erythrinoids, the\r\nGymnotines, &c. “I am often asked what is my chief aim in this\r\nexpedition to South America? No doubt in a general way it is to collect\r\nmaterials for future study. But the conviction which draws me\r\nirresistibly, is that the combination of animals on this continent,\r\nwhere the faunæ are so characteristic and so distinct from all others,\r\nwill give me the means of showing that the transmutation theory is\r\nwholly without foundation in facts.” The lecture closed with some\r\naccount of the Salmonidæ, found all over the northern hemisphere, but\r\nrepresented in South America by the Characines, distinct species of\r\nwhich may be looked for in the separate water-basins of Brazil; and also\r\nof several other important families of South American fishes, especially\r\nthe Osteoglossum, the Sudis, &c., interesting on account of their\r\nrelation to an extinct fossil type, that of the Cœlacanths.[13]\r\n\r\n_April 17th._—Yesterday was Easter Sunday, and the day was beautiful.\r\nThe services from Bishop Potter in the morning were very interesting;\r\nthe more so for us on account of the God speed he gave us. Wind and\r\nweather permitting, it is the last Sunday we shall pass on board ship\r\ntogether. The Bishop spoke with much earnestness and sympathy of the\r\nobjects of the expedition, addressing himself especially to the young\r\nmen, not only with reference to their duties as connected with a\r\nscientific undertaking, but as American citizens in a foreign country at\r\nthis time of war and misapprehension.\r\n\r\nThis morning we were quite entertained at meeting a number of the\r\nso-called “Catamarans,” the crazy crafts of the fishermen, who appear to\r\nbe amphibious animals on this coast. Their boats consist of a few logs\r\nlashed together, over which the water breaks at every moment without\r\napparently disturbing the occupants in the least. They fish, walk about,\r\nsit, lie down or stand, eat, drink, and sleep, to all appearance as\r\ncontented and comfortable as we are in our princely steamer. Usually\r\nthey go into port at nightfall, but are occasionally driven out to sea\r\nby the wind, and may sometimes be met with two hundred miles and more\r\nfrom the shore. To-day we have fairly come upon the South American\r\ncoast. Yesterday we could catch sight occasionally of low sand banks;\r\nbut this morning we have sailed past the pretty little town of Olinda,\r\nwith its convent on the hill, and the larger city of Pernambuco, whose\r\nwhite houses come quite down to the sea-shore. Immediately in front of\r\nthe town lies the reef, which runs southward along the coast for a\r\nhundred miles and more, enclosing between itself and the shore a strip\r\nof quiet waters, forming admirable anchorage for small shipping. Before\r\nPernambuco this channel is quite deep, and directly in front of the town\r\nthere is a break in the reef forming a natural gateway through which\r\nlarge vessels can enter. We have now left the town behind, but the shore\r\nis still in sight; a flat coast rising into low hills behind, and here\r\nand there dotted with villages and fishing-huts.\r\n\r\nThe lecture on Saturday was rather practical than scientific, on the\r\nbest modes of collecting and preserving specimens, the instruments to be\r\nused, &c. To-day it was upon the classification of fishes as illustrated\r\nby embryology; the same method of study as that explained the other day\r\nand now applied to the class of fishes. “All fishes at the time when the\r\ngerm becomes distinct above the yolk have a continuous fin over the\r\nwhole back, around the tail, and under the abdomen. The naked reptiles,\r\nthose which have no scales, such as frogs, toads, salamanders, and the\r\nlike, share in this embryological feature of the fishes. From this\r\nidentity of development I believe the naked reptiles to be structurally\r\nnearer to the true fishes than to the scaly reptiles. All fishes, and\r\nindeed all Vertebrates, even the highest, have, at this early period,\r\nfissures in the side of the neck. These are the first indications of\r\ngills, an organ the basis for which exists in all Vertebrates at a\r\ncertain period of their life, but is fully developed and functionally\r\nactive only in the lower ones, in which it acquires a special final\r\nstructure; giving place to lungs in the higher ones before they reach\r\ntheir adult condition. From this time forward not only the class\r\ncharacters, but those of the family, begin to be distinguished. I will\r\nshow you to-day how we may improve the classification of fishes by\r\nstudying their embryology. Take, for instance, the family of Cods in its\r\nwidest acceptation. It consists of several genera, among which are the\r\nCod proper, the Cusk, and the Brotula. Naturalists may differ in their\r\nestimation of the relative rank of these genera, and even with reference\r\nto their affinity, but the embryology of the Cod seems to me to give the\r\nnatural scale. In its early condition the Cod has the continuous fin of\r\nthe Brotula, next the dorsal and caudal fins become distinct, as in the\r\nCusk, and lastly the final individualization of the fins takes place,\r\nand they break up into the three dorsals and two anals of the Cod. Thus\r\nthe Brotula represents the infantile condition of the Cod, and of course\r\nstands lowest, while the Cusk has its natural position between the two.\r\nThere are other genera belonging to this family, as, for instance, the\r\nLota or fresh-water Cusk and the Hake, the relative position of which\r\nmay be determined by further embryological studies. I had an opportunity\r\nof observing something in the development of the Hake which throws some\r\nlight on the relation of the Ophidini to the Cod family, though thus far\r\nthey have been associated with the Eel. The little embryonic Hake on\r\nwhich I made my investigation was about an inch and a half in length; it\r\nwas much more slender and elongated in proportion to its thickness than\r\nany of the family of Cods in their adult condition, and had a continuous\r\nfin all around the body. Although the structural relations of the Eels\r\nare not fully understood, some of them, at least, now united as a\r\ndistinct family under the name of Ophidini, are known to be closely\r\nconnected with the Cods, and this character of the Hake in its early\r\ncondition would seem to show that this type of Eel is a sort of\r\nembryonic form of the Cod family.\r\n\r\n“Another well-known family of fishes is that of the Lophioides. To this\r\ngroup belongs the Lophius or Goose-fish, with which the Cottoids or\r\nSculpins, and the Blennioids, with Zoarces and Anarrhichas, the\r\nso-called Sea-cat, ought to be associated. It was my good fortune to\r\nhave an opportunity of studying the development of the Lophius, and to\r\nmy surprise I found that its embryonic phases included the whole series\r\nhere alluded to, thus presenting another of those natural scales on\r\nwhich I hope all our scientific classifications will be remodelled when\r\nwe obtain a better knowledge of embryology. The Lophius in its youngest\r\nstage recalls the Tænioids, being long and compressed; next it resembles\r\nthe Blennioids, and growing stouter passes through a stage like Cottus,\r\nbefore it assumes the depressed form of Lophius. In the family of\r\nCyprinodonts I have observed the young of Fundulus. They are destitute\r\nof ventrals, thus showing that the genus Orestias stands lowest in its\r\nfamily. I would allude to one other fact of this kind observed by\r\nProfessor Wyman. There has been a doubt among naturalists as to the\r\nrelative standing of the Skates and Sharks. On geological evidence I had\r\nplaced the Skates highest, because the Sharks precede them in time; but\r\nthis fact had not been established on embryological evidence. Professor\r\nWyman has followed the embryology of the Skate through all its phases,\r\nand has found that in its earlier condition it is slender in outline,\r\nwith the appearance of a diminutive shark, and that only later it\r\nassumes the broad shield-like form and long tapering tail of the skate.\r\nWere it only that they enable us to set aside all arbitrary decisions\r\nand base our classifications on the teachings of nature, these\r\ninvestigations would be invaluable; but their importance is increased by\r\nthe consideration that we are thus gradually led to recognize the true\r\naffinities which bind all organized beings into one great system.”\r\n\r\n_April 20th._—The day after to-morrow we shall enter the Bay of Rio de\r\nJaneiro. One begins to see already that little disturbance in the\r\nregularity of sea life which precedes arrival. People are making up\r\ntheir letters, and rearranging their luggage; there is a slight stir\r\npervading our small party of passengers and breaking up the even tenor\r\nof the uniform life we have been leading together for the last three\r\nweeks. It has been a delightful voyage, and yet, under the most charming\r\ncircumstances, life at sea is a poor exchange for life on land, and we\r\nare all glad to be near our haven.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday the lecture was upon the formation and growth of the egg; a\r\nsort of practical lesson in the study of embryology; yesterday, upon the\r\nimportance of ascertaining, at the outset, the spawning season of the\r\nanimals in Brazil, and the means to that end. “It will often be\r\nimpossible for us to learn the breeding season of animals, a matter in\r\nwhich country people are generally very ignorant. But when we cannot\r\nobtain it from persons about us, there are some indications in the\r\nanimals themselves which may serve as a guide. During my own\r\ninvestigations upon the development of the turtles, when I opened many\r\nthousands of eggs, I found that in these animals, at least, the\r\nappearance of the ovaries is a pretty good guide. They always contain\r\nseveral sets of eggs. Those which will be laid this year are the\r\nlargest; those of the following year are next in size; those of two\r\nyears hence still smaller, until we come to eggs so small that it is\r\nimpossible to perceive any difference between their various phases of\r\ndevelopment. But we can readily tell whether there are any eggs so\r\nadvanced as to be near laying, and distinguish between the brood of the\r\nyear and those which are to be hatched later. When the eggs are about to\r\nbe laid the whole surface is covered with ramifying blood-vessels, and\r\nthe yolk is of a very clear bright yellow. Before the egg drops from the\r\novary this network bursts; it shrivels up and forms a little scar on the\r\nside of the ovary. Should we, therefore, on examining the ovary of a\r\nturtle, find that these scars are fresh, we may infer that the season\r\nfor laying is not over; or if we find some of the eggs much larger than\r\nthe rest and nearly mature, we shall know that it is about to begin. How\r\nfar this will hold good with respect to alligators and other animals I\r\ndo not know. I have learned to recognize these signs in the turtles from\r\nmy long study of their embryology. With fishes it could hardly be\r\npossible to distinguish the different sets of eggs because they lay such\r\nnumbers, and they are all so small. But if we cannot distinguish the\r\neggs of the different years, it will be something to learn the size of\r\ntheir broods, which differs very greatly in different families.”\r\n\r\nThe lecture concluded with some advice as to observing and recording the\r\nmetamorphoses of insects. “Though much has been written on the societies\r\nof ants and other like communities in Brazil, the accounts of different\r\nnaturalists do not agree. It would be well to collect the larvæ of a\r\ngreat many insects, and try to raise them; but as this will be difficult\r\nand often impossible in travelling, we must at least get the nests of\r\nants, bees, wasps, and the like, in order to ascertain all we can\r\nrespecting their communities. When these are not too large it is easy to\r\nsecure them by slipping a bag over them, thus taking the whole\r\nsettlement captive. It may then be preserved by dipping into alcohol,\r\nand examined at leisure, so as to ascertain the number and nature of the\r\nindividuals contained in it, and learn something at least of their\r\nhabits. Nor let us neglect the domestic establishments of spiders. There\r\nis an immense variety of spiders in South America, and a great\r\ndifference in their webs. It would be well to preserve these on sheets\r\nof paper, to make drawings of them, and examine their threads\r\nmicroscopically.”\r\n\r\n_April 21st._—Yesterday Mr. Agassiz gave his closing lecture, knowing\r\nthat to-day all would be occupied with preparations for landing. He gave\r\na little history of Steenstrup and Sars, and showed the influence their\r\nembryological investigations have had in reforming classification, and\r\nalso their direct bearing upon the question of the origin of species. To\r\nthese investigators science owes the discovery of the so-called\r\n“alternate generations,” in which the Hydroid, either by budding or by\r\nthe breaking up of its own body, gives rise to numerous jelly-fishes;\r\nthese lay eggs which produce Hydroids again, and the Hydroids renew the\r\nprocess as before.[14]\r\n\r\n“These results are but recently added to the annals of science, and are\r\nnot yet very extensively known in the community; but when the facts are\r\nmore fully understood, they cannot fail to affect the fundamental\r\nprinciples of zoölogy. I have been astonished to see how little weight\r\nDarwin himself gives to this series of transformations; he hardly\r\nalludes to it, and yet it has a very direct bearing on his theory, since\r\nit shows that, however great the divergence from the starting-point in\r\nany process of development, it ever returns to the road of its normal\r\ndestiny; the cycle may be wide, but the boundaries are as impassable as\r\nif it were narrower. However these processes of development may\r\napproach, or even cross each other, they never end in making any living\r\nbeing different from the one which gave it birth, though in reaching\r\nthat point it may pass through phases resembling other animals.\r\n\r\n“In considering these questions we should remember how slight are most\r\nof those specific differences, the origin of which gives rise to so much\r\ncontroversy, in comparison with the cycle of changes undergone by every\r\nindividual in the course of its development. There are numerous genera,\r\nincluding many very closely allied species, distinguished by differences\r\nwhich, were it not for the fact that they have remained unchanged and\r\ninvariable through ages, might be termed insignificant. Such, for\r\ninstance, are the various species of corals found in the everglades of\r\nFlorida, where they lived and died ages ago, and had the identical\r\nspecific differences by which we distinguish their successors in the\r\npresent Florida reefs. The whole science of zoölogy in its present\r\ncondition is based upon the fact that these slight differences are\r\nmaintained generation after generation. And yet every individual on such\r\na coral stock,—and the same is true of any individual in any class\r\nwhatsoever of the whole animal kingdom, whether Radiate, Mollusk,\r\nArticulate, or Vertebrate,—before reaching its adult condition and\r\nassuming the permanent characters which distinguish it from other\r\nspecies, and have never been known to vary, passes in a comparatively\r\nshort period through an extraordinary transformation, the successive\r\nphases of which differ far more from each other than do the adult\r\nspecies. In other words, the same individual differs more from himself\r\nin successive stages of his growth than he does in his adult condition\r\nfrom kindred species of the same genus. The conclusion seems inevitable,\r\nthat, if the slight differences which distinguish species were not\r\ninherent, and if the phases through which every individual has to pass\r\nwere not the appointed means to reach that end, themselves invariable,\r\nthere would be ever-recurring deviations from the normal types. Every\r\nnaturalist knows that this is not the case. All the deviations known to\r\nus are monstrosities, and the occurrence of these, under disturbing\r\ninfluences, are to my mind only additional evidence of the fixity of\r\nspecies. The extreme deviations obtained in domesticity are secured, as\r\nis well known, at the expense of the typical characters, and end usually\r\nin the production of sterile individuals. All such facts seem to show\r\nthat so-called varieties or breeds, far from indicating the beginning of\r\nnew types, or the initiating of incipient species, only point out the\r\nrange of flexibility in types which in their essence are invariable.\r\n\r\n“In the discussion of the development theory in its present form, a\r\ngreat deal is said of the imperfection of the geological record. But it\r\nseems to me that, however fragmentary our knowledge of geology, its\r\nincompleteness does not invalidate certain important points in the\r\nevidence. It is well known that the crust of our earth is divided into a\r\nnumber of layers, all of which contain the remains of distinct\r\npopulations. These different sets of inhabitants who have possessed the\r\nearth at successive periods have each a character of their own. The\r\ntransmutation theory insists that they owe their origin to gradual\r\ntransformations, and are not, therefore, the result of distinct creative\r\nacts. All agree, however, that we arrive at a lower stratum where no\r\ntrace of life is to be found. Place it where we will: suppose that we\r\nare mistaken in thinking that we have reached the beginning of life with\r\nthe lowest Cambrian deposit; suppose that the first animals preceded\r\nthis epoch, and that there was an earlier epoch, to be called the\r\nLaurentian system, beside many others older still; it is nevertheless\r\ntrue that geology brings us down to a level at which the character of\r\nthe earth’s crust made organic life impossible. At this point, wherever\r\nwe place it, the origin of animals by development was impossible,\r\nbecause they had no ancestors. This is the true starting-point, and\r\nuntil we have some facts to prove that the power, whatever it was, which\r\noriginated the first animals has ceased to act, I see no reason for\r\nreferring the origin of life to any other cause. I grant that we have no\r\nsuch evidence of an active creative power as Science requires for\r\npositive demonstration of her laws, and that we cannot explain the\r\nprocesses which lie at the origin of life. But if the facts are\r\ninsufficient on our side, they are absolutely wanting on the other. We\r\ncannot certainly consider the development theory proved, because a few\r\nnaturalists think it plausible: it seems plausible only to the few, and\r\nit is demonstrated by none. I bring this subject before you now, not to\r\nurge upon you this or that theory, strong as my own convictions are. I\r\nwish only to warn you, not against the development theory itself, but\r\nagainst the looseness in the methods of study upon which it is based.\r\nWhatever be your ultimate opinions on this subject, let them rest on\r\nfacts and not on arguments, however plausible. This is not a question to\r\nbe argued, it is one to be investigated.\r\n\r\n“As I have advanced in these talks with you, I have become more and more\r\ndissatisfied, feeling the difficulty of laying out our work without a\r\npractical familiarity with the objects themselves. But this is the\r\ninevitable position of one who is seeking the truth: till we have found\r\nit, we are more or less feeling our way. I am aware that in my lectures\r\nI have covered a far wider range of subjects than we can handle, even if\r\nevery man do his very best; if we accomplish one tenth of the work I\r\nhave suggested, I shall be more than satisfied with the result of the\r\nexpedition. In closing, I can hardly add anything to the impressive\r\nadmonitions of Bishop Potter in his parting words to us last Sunday, for\r\nwhich I thank him in your name and my own. But I would remind you, that,\r\nwhile America has recovered her political independence, while we all\r\nhave that confidence in our institutions which makes us secure, that so\r\nfar as we are true to them, doing what we do conscientiously and in full\r\nview of our responsibilities we shall be in the right path, we have not\r\nyet achieved our intellectual independence. There is a disposition in\r\nthis country to refer all literary and scientific matters to European\r\ntribunals; to accept a man because he has obtained the award of\r\nsocieties abroad. An American author is often better satisfied if he\r\npublish his book in England than at home. In my opinion, every man who\r\npublishes his work on the other side of the water deprives his country\r\nof so much intellectual capital to which she has a right. Publish your\r\nresults at home, and let Europe discover whether they are worth reading.\r\nNot until you are faithful to your citizenship in your intellectual as\r\nwell as your political life, will you be truly upright and worthy\r\nstudents of nature.”\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of these remarks a set of resolutions was read by\r\nBishop Potter.[15] They were followed by a few little friendly speeches,\r\nall made in the most informal and cordial spirit; and so ended our\r\ncourse of lectures on board the Colorado. Later in the day we observed\r\nsingular bright red patches in the sea. Some were not less than seven or\r\neight feet in length, rather oblong, and the whole mass looked as red as\r\nblood. Sometimes they seemed to lie on the very top of the water,\r\nsometimes to be a little below it, so as only to tinge the rippling\r\nsurface. One of the sailors succeeded in catching a portion of it in a\r\nbucket, when it was found to consist of a solid mass of little\r\ncrustaceans, bright red in color. They were all very lively, keeping up\r\na constant rapid motion. Mr. Agassiz examined them under the microscope\r\nand found them to be the young of a crab. He has no doubt that every\r\nsuch patch is a single brood, floating thus compactly together like\r\nspawn.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2:\r\n\r\n  On the 17th of May, nearly a month after our arrival in Rio, this\r\n  cloud was interpreted to us. It was, indeed, charged with the issues\r\n  of life and death, for it was on this day and the following that the\r\n  final assaults on Petersburg were made, and the cloud which marred an\r\n  otherwise stainless sky, as we were passing along the shores of\r\n  Virginia, was, no doubt, the mass of smoke gathered above the opposing\r\n  lines of the two armies.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3:\r\n\r\n  The species of Hydroids most numerous upon the gulf-weed have not yet\r\n  been described, and would form a valuable addition to the Natural\r\n  History of the Acalephs. For an account of the animals of this class\r\n  inhabiting the Atlantic coast of North America, and especially the New\r\n  England shores, I may refer to the third volume of my Contributions to\r\n  the Natural History of the United States, and to the second number of\r\n  the Illustrated Catalogue of the Museum of Comparative Zoloögy at\r\n  Cambridge.—L. A.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4:\r\n\r\n  “This stream,” he writes, “is probably generated by the great\r\n  accumulation of water on the eastern coast of America, between the\r\n  tropics, by the trade-winds which constantly blow there.” These views,\r\n  though vaguely hinted at by old Spanish navigators, were first\r\n  distinctly set forth by Franklin, and, as is stated in a recent\r\n  printed report of the Coast Survey Explorations, “they receive\r\n  confirmation from every discovery which the advance of scientific\r\n  research brings to aid in the solution of the great problem of oceanic\r\n  circulation.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 5:\r\n\r\n  No one can read the account of the explorations undertaken by the\r\n  Coast Survey in the Gulf Stream, and continued during a number of\r\n  successive years, and the instructions received by the officers thus\r\n  employed from the Superintendent, Dr. A. D. Bache, without feeling how\r\n  comprehensive, keen, and persevering was the intellect which has long\r\n  presided over this department of our public works. The result is a\r\n  very thorough survey of the stream, especially along the coast of our\r\n  own continent, with sections giving the temperature to a great depth,\r\n  the relations of the cold and warm streaks, the form of the ocean\r\n  bottom, as well as various other details respecting the direction and\r\n  force of the current, the density and color of the water, and the\r\n  animal and vegetable productions contained in it. (See Appendix No.\r\n  I.)—L. A.\r\n\r\nFootnote 6:\r\n\r\n  This anticipation was more than confirmed by the result of the\r\n  journey. It is true that Mr. Agassiz did not go beyond the Peruvian\r\n  frontier, and therefore could not verify his prophecy in that region.\r\n  But he found the localization of species in the Amazons circumscribed\r\n  within much narrower limits than he expected, the whole length of the\r\n  great stream, as well as its tributaries, being broken up into\r\n  numerous distinct faunæ. There can be no doubt that what is true for\r\n  nearly three thousand miles of its course is true also for the\r\n  head-waters of the Amazons; indeed, other investigators have already\r\n  described some species from its higher tributaries differing entirely\r\n  from those collected upon this expedition.\r\n\r\nFootnote 7:\r\n\r\n  Mr. Agassiz afterward visited these hills himself, and an account of\r\n  their structure and probable origin will be found in the chapter on\r\n  the physical history of the Amazons.\r\n\r\nFootnote 8:\r\n\r\n  See Appendix No. II.\r\n\r\nFootnote 9:\r\n\r\n  It proved in the sequel unnecessary to seek the glacial phenomena of\r\n  tropical South America in its highest mountains. In Brazil the\r\n  moraines are as distinct and as well preserved in some of the coast\r\n  ranges on the Atlantic side, not more than twelve or fifteen hundred\r\n  feet high, as in any glaciated localities known to geologists in more\r\n  northern parts of the world. The snow line, even in those latitudes,\r\n  then descended so low that masses of ice formed above its level\r\n  actually forced their way down to the sea-coast.—L. A.\r\n\r\nFootnote 10:\r\n\r\n  In copying the journal from which these notes are taken, I have\r\n  hesitated to burden the narrative with anatomical details. But for\r\n  those who take an interest in such investigations it may be well to\r\n  add here that the frog, when first hatched, is simply an oblong body,\r\n  without any appendages, and tapering slightly towards its posterior\r\n  end. In that condition it resembles the Cecilia. In its next stage,\r\n  that of the tadpole, when the extremity has elongated into a tail, the\r\n  gills are fairly developed, and it has one pair of imperfect legs, it\r\n  resembles the Siren, with its rudimentary limbs. In its succeeding\r\n  stages, when the same animal has two pairs of legs and a fin around\r\n  the tail, it recalls the Proteus and Menobranchus. Finally the gills\r\n  are suppressed, the animal breathes through lungs, but the tail still\r\n  remains; it then recalls Menopoma and the Salamanders. At last the\r\n  tail shrinks and disappears, and the frog is complete. This gives us a\r\n  standard by which the relative position of the leading groups of the\r\n  class may safely be determined.—L. A.\r\n\r\nFootnote 11:\r\n\r\n  On account of the many exploring expeditions for which the Bay of Rio\r\n  de Janeiro has been a favorite port, it has acquired a special\r\n  interest for the naturalist. It may seem at first sight as if the fact\r\n  that French, English, German, Russian, and American expeditions have\r\n  followed each other in this locality, during the last century, each\r\n  bringing away its rich harvest of specimens, by diminishing its\r\n  novelty would rather lessen than increase its interest as a collecting\r\n  ground. On the contrary, for the very reason that the specimens from\r\n  which the greater part of the descriptions and figures contained in\r\n  the published accounts of these voyages were obtained from Rio de\r\n  Janeiro and its neighborhood, it becomes indispensable that every\r\n  zoölogical museum aiming at scientific accuracy and completeness\r\n  should have original specimens from that very locality for the\r\n  identification of species already described. Otherwise doubts\r\n  respecting the strict identity or specific difference of specimens\r\n  obtained on other parts of the Atlantic shore, not only in South\r\n  America but in Central and North America, may at any time invalidate\r\n  important generalizations concerning the distribution of animals in\r\n  these seas. From this point of view, the Bay of Rio de Janeiro forms a\r\n  most important centre of comparison, and it was for this reason that\r\n  we made so prolonged a stay there. Although the prospect of\r\n  discovering any novelties was diminished by the extensive\r\n  investigations of our predecessors, I well knew that whatever we\r\n  collected there would greatly increase the value of our collections\r\n  elsewhere. One of my special aims was to ascertain how far the marine\r\n  animals inhabiting the coast of Brazil to the south of Cape Frio\r\n  differed from those to the north of it, and furthermore, how the\r\n  animals found along the coast between Cape Frio and Cape St. Roque\r\n  differed from or agreed with those inhabiting the more northern shore\r\n  of the continent and the West Indian Islands. In the course of the\r\n  following chapters I shall have occasion to return, more in detail, to\r\n  this subject.—L. A.\r\n\r\nFootnote 12:\r\n\r\n  Molinesia and Pœcilia.\r\n\r\nFootnote 13:\r\n\r\n  This lecture was accompanied by careful descriptions and drawings on\r\n  the blackboard, showing the structural differences between these\r\n  groups. These are omitted, as they would have little interest for the\r\n  general reader. The chief object in reporting these lectures is to\r\n  show the aims which Mr. Agassiz placed before himself and his\r\n  companions in laying out the work of the expedition, and these are\r\n  made sufficiently clear without further scientific details.\r\n\r\nFootnote 14:\r\n\r\n  As these investigations have been published with so much detail\r\n  (Steenstrup, Alternate Generation, Sars’s Fauna Norwegica; L. Agassiz,\r\n  Contr. to Nat. Hist. of U. S.), it has not been thought necessary to\r\n  reproduce this part of the lecture here. Any one who cares to read a\r\n  less technical account of these investigations than those originally\r\n  published, will find it in “Methods of Study,” by L. Agassiz.\r\n\r\nFootnote 15:\r\n\r\n  See Appendix No. III.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n             RIO DE JANEIRO AND ITS ENVIRONS.—JUIZ DE FORA.\r\n\r\n  ARRIVAL.—ASPECT OF HARBOR AND CITY.—CUSTOM-HOUSE.—FIRST GLIMPSE OF\r\n    BRAZILIAN LIFE.—NEGRO DANCE.—EFFECT OF EMANCIPATION IN UNITED\r\n    STATES UPON SLAVERY IN BRAZIL.—FIRST ASPECT OF RIO DE JANEIRO ON\r\n    LAND.—PICTURESQUE STREET GROUPS.—ECLIPSE OF THE SUN.—AT HOME IN\r\n    RIO.—LARANGEIRAS.—PASSEIO PUBLICO.—EXCURSION ON THE DOM PEDRO\r\n    RAILROAD.—VISIT OF THE EMPEROR TO THE COLORADO.—CORDIALITY OF\r\n    GOVERNMENT TO THE EXPEDITION.—LABORATORY.—BOTANICAL\r\n    GARDEN.—ALLEY OF PALMS.—EXCURSION TO THE CORCOVADO.—JUIZ DE FORA\r\n    ROAD.—PETROPOLIS.—TROPICAL VEGETATION.—RIDE FROM PETROPOLIS TO\r\n    JUIZ DE FORA.—VISIT TO SENHOR LAGE.—EXCURSION TO THE “FOREST OF\r\n    THE EMPRESS.”—VISIT TO MR.

The coast range here, though not very lofty,\r\n(its highest summits ranging only from two to three thousand feet,) is\r\nbold and precipitous. The peaks are very conical, and the sides slope\r\nsteeply to the water’s edge, where, in many places, a wide beach runs\r\nalong their base. The scenery grew more picturesque as we approached the\r\nentrance of the bay, which is guarded by heights rising sentinel-like on\r\neither side. Once within this narrow rocky portal, the immense harbor,\r\nstretching northward for more than twenty miles, seems rather like a\r\nvast lake enclosed by mountains than like a bay. On one side extends the\r\nridge which shuts it from the sea, broken by the sharp peaks of the\r\nCorcovado, the Tijuca, and the flat-topped Gavia; on the other side, and\r\nmore inland, the Organ Mountains lift their singular needle-like points,\r\nwhile within the entrance rises the bare bleak rock so well known as the\r\nSugar Loaf (_Paō de Assucar_). Were it not for the gateway behind us,\r\nthrough which we still have a glimpse of the open ocean, and for the\r\nshipping lying here at anchor, leaving the port or entering it, we might\r\neasily believe that we were floating on some great quiet sheet of inland\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nWe reached our anchorage at eleven o’clock, but were in no haste to\r\nleave the ocean home where we have been so happy and so comfortable for\r\nthree weeks past; and as the captain had kindly invited us to stay on\r\nboard till our permanent arrangements were made, we remained on deck,\r\ngreatly entertained by all the stir and confusion attending our arrival.\r\nSome of our young people took one of the many boats which crowded at\r\nonce around our steamer, and went directly to the city; but we were\r\nsatisfied with the impressions of the day, and not sorry to leave them\r\nundisturbed. As night came on, sunset lit up the mountains and the\r\nharbor. In this latitude, however, the glory of the twilight is soon\r\nover, and as darkness fell upon the city it began to glitter with\r\ninnumerable lights along the shore and on the hillsides. The city of Rio\r\nde Janeiro spreads in a kind of crescent shape around the western side\r\nof the bay, its environs stretching out to a considerable distance along\r\nthe beaches, and running up on to the hills behind also. On account of\r\nthis disposition of the houses, covering a wide area and scattered upon\r\nthe water’s edge, instead of being compact and concentrated, the\r\nappearance of the city at night is exceedingly pretty. It has a kind of\r\nscenic effect. The lights run up on the hill-slopes, a little cluster\r\ncrowning their summits here and there, and they glimmer all along the\r\nshore for two or three miles on either side of the central, business\r\npart of the town.\r\n\r\nSoon after our arrival Mr. Agassiz received an official visit from a\r\ncustom-house agent, saying that he had orders to land all our baggage\r\nwithout examination, and that a boat would be sent at any day and hour\r\nconvenient to him to bring his effects on shore. This was a great\r\nrelief, as the scientific apparatus, added to the personal luggage of so\r\nlarge a party, makes a fearful array of boxes, cases, &c. It would be a\r\nlong business to pass it all through the cumbrous ceremonies of a\r\ncustom-house. This afternoon, while Mr. Agassiz had gone to San\r\nChristovāo[16] to acknowledge this courtesy and to pay his respects to\r\nthe Emperor, we were wandering over a little island (_Ilha das Enxadas_)\r\nnear which our ship lies, and from which she takes in coal for her\r\nfarther voyage. The proprietor, besides his coal-wharf, has a very\r\npretty house and garden, with a small chapel adjoining. It was my first\r\nglimpse of tropical vegetation and of Brazilian life, and had all the\r\ncharm of novelty. As we landed, a group of slaves, black as ebony, were\r\nsinging and dancing a fandango. So far as we could understand, there was\r\na leader who opened the game with a sort of chant, apparently addressed\r\nto each in turn as he passed around the circle, the others joining in\r\nchorus at regular intervals. Presently he broke into a dance which rose\r\nin wildness and excitement, accompanied by cries and ejaculations. The\r\nmovements of the body were a singular combination of negro and Spanish\r\ndances. The legs and feet had the short, jerking, loose-jointed motion\r\nof our negroes in dancing, while the upper part of the body and the arms\r\nhad that swaying, rhythmical movement from side to side so\r\ncharacteristic of all the Spanish dances. After looking on for a while\r\nwe went into the garden, where there were cocoa-nut and banana trees in\r\nfruit, passion-vines climbing over the house, with here and there a dark\r\ncrimson flower gleaming between the leaves. The effect was pretty, and\r\nthe whole scene had, to my eye, an aspect half Southern, half Oriental.\r\nIt was nearly dark when we returned to the boat, but the negroes were\r\ncontinuing their dance under the glow of a bonfire. From time to time,\r\nas the dance reached its culminating point, they stirred their fire, and\r\nlighted up the wild group with its vivid blaze. The dance and the song\r\nhad, like the amusements of the negroes in all lands, an endless\r\nmonotonous repetition. Looking at their half-naked figures and\r\nunintelligent faces, the question arose, so constantly suggested when we\r\ncome in contact with this race, “What will they do with this great gift\r\nof freedom?” The only corrective for the half doubt is to consider the\r\nwhites side by side with them: whatever one may think of the condition\r\nof slavery for the blacks, there can be no question as to its evil\r\neffects on their masters. Captain Bradbury asked the proprietor of the\r\nisland whether he hired or owned his slaves. “Own them,—a hundred and\r\nmore; but it will finish soon,” he answered in his broken English.\r\n“Finish soon! how do you mean?” “It finish with you; and when it finish\r\nwith you, it finish here, it finish everywhere.” He said it not in any\r\ntone of regret or complaint, but as an inevitable fact. The death-note\r\nof slavery in the United States was its death-note everywhere. We\r\nthought this significant and cheering.\r\n\r\n_April 24th._—To-day we ladies went on shore for a few hours, engaged\r\nour rooms, and drove about the city a little. The want of cleanliness\r\nand thrift in the general aspect of Rio de Janeiro is very striking as\r\ncompared with the order, neatness, and regularity of our large towns.\r\nThe narrow streets, with the inevitable gutter running down the\r\nmiddle,—a sink for all kinds of impurities,—the absence of a proper\r\nsewerage, the general aspect of decay (partly due, no doubt, to the\r\ndampness of the climate), the indolent expression of the people\r\ngenerally, make a singular impression on one who comes from the midst of\r\nour stirring, energetic population. And yet it has a picturesqueness\r\nthat, to the traveller at least, compensates for its defects. All who\r\nhave seen one of these old Portuguese or Spanish tropical towns, with\r\ntheir odd narrow streets and many-colored houses with balconied windows\r\nand stuccoed or painted walls, only the more variegated from the fact\r\nthat here and there the stucco has peeled off, know the fascination and\r\nthe charm which make themselves felt, spite of the dirt and discomfort.\r\nThen the groups in the street,—the half-naked black carriers, many of\r\nthem straight and firm as bronze statues under the heavy loads which\r\nrest so securely on their heads, the padres in their long coats and\r\nsquare hats, the mules laden with baskets of fruit or vegetables,—all\r\nthis makes a motley scene, entertaining enough to the new-comer. I have\r\nnever seen such effective-looking negroes, from an artistic point of\r\nview, as here. To-day a black woman passed us in the street, dressed in\r\nwhite, with bare neck and arms, the sleeves caught up with some kind of\r\narmlet, a large white turban of soft muslin on her head, and a long\r\nbright-colored shawl passed crosswise under one arm and thrown over the\r\nother shoulder, hanging almost to the feet behind. She no doubt was of\r\nthe colored gentry. Just beyond her sat a black woman on the curbstone,\r\nalmost without clothing, her glossy skin shining in the sun, and her\r\nnaked child asleep across her knees. Or take this as another picture: an\r\nold wall several feet wide, covered with vines, overhung with thick\r\nfoliage, the top of which seems to be a stand for the venders of fruits,\r\nvegetables, &c. Here lies at full length a powerful negro looking over\r\ninto the street, his jetty arms crossed on a huge basket of crimson\r\nflowers, oranges and bananas, against which he half rests, seemingly too\r\nindolent to lift a finger even to attract a purchaser.\r\n\r\n_April 25th._—Nature seems to welcome our arrival, not only by her most\r\ngenial, but also by her exceptional moods. There has been to-day an\r\neclipse of the sun, total at Cape Frio, sixty miles from here, almost\r\ntotal here. We saw it from the deck of the ship, not having yet taken up\r\nour quarters in town. The effect was as strange as it was beautiful.\r\nThere was a something weird, uncanny in the pallor and chill which came\r\nover the landscape; it was not in the least like a common twilight, but\r\nhad a ghastly, phantom-like element in it. Mr. Agassiz passed the\r\nmorning at the palace where the Emperor had invited him to witness the\r\neclipse from his observatory. The clouds are poor courtiers, however,\r\nand unfortunately a mist hung over San Christovāo, obscuring the\r\nphenomenon at the moment of its greatest interest. Our post of\r\nobservation was better for this special occasion than the Imperial\r\nobservatory, and yet, though the general scene was perhaps more\r\neffective in the harbor than on the shore, Mr. Agassiz had an\r\nopportunity of making some interesting observations on the action of\r\nanimals under these novel circumstances. The following extract is from\r\nhis notes. “The effect of the waning light on animals was very striking.\r\nThe bay of Rio is daily frequented by large numbers of frigate-birds and\r\ngannets, which at night fly to the outer islands to roost, while the\r\ncarrion-crows (_urubús_) swarming in the suburbs, and especially about\r\nthe slaughterhouses of the city, retire to the mountains in the\r\nneighborhood of Tijuca, their line of travel passing over San\r\nChristovāo. As soon as the light began to diminish, these birds became\r\nuneasy; evidently conscious that their day was strangely encroached\r\nupon, they were uncertain for a moment how to act. Presently, however,\r\nas the darkness increased, they started for their usual night quarters,\r\nthe water-birds flying southward, the vultures in a northwesterly\r\ndirection, and they had all left their feeding-grounds before the moment\r\nof greatest obscurity arrived. They seemed to fly in all haste, but were\r\nnot half-way to their night home when the light began to return with\r\nrapidly increasing brightness. Their confusion was now at its height.\r\nSome continued their flight towards the mountains or the harbor, others\r\nhurried back to the city, while others whirled about wholly uncertain\r\nwhat to do next. The re-establishment of the full light of noon seemed\r\nto decide them, however, upon making another day of it, and the whole\r\ncrowd once more moved steadily toward the city.”\r\n\r\nThe cordial interest shown by the Emperor in all the objects of the\r\npresent expedition is very encouraging to Mr. Agassiz. So liberal a\r\nspirit in the head of the government will make his own task\r\ncomparatively easy. He has also seen several official persons on\r\nbusiness appertaining to his scientific schemes. Everywhere he receives\r\nthe warmest expressions of sympathy, and is assured that the\r\nadministration will give him every facility in its power to carry out\r\nhis plans. To-night finds us established in our rooms, and our Brazilian\r\nlife begins; with what success remains to be seen. While still on board\r\nthe “Colorado” we seemed to have one foot on our own soil.\r\n\r\n_April 26th._—This morning Mrs. C—— and myself devoted to the arranging\r\nof our little domestic matters, getting out our books, desks, and other\r\nknickknacks, and making ourselves at home in our new quarters, where we\r\nsuppose we are likely to be for some weeks to come. This afternoon we\r\ndrove out on the Larangeiras road (literally, the “orangery”). Our first\r\ndrive in Rio left upon my mind an impression of picturesque decay;\r\nthings seemed falling to pieces, it is true, but mindful of artistic\r\neffect even in their last moments. This impression was quite effaced\r\nto-day. Every city has its least becoming aspect, and it seems we had\r\nchosen an unfavorable direction for our first tour of observation. The\r\nLarangeiras road is lined on either side by a succession of country\r\nhouses; low and spreading, often with wide verandas, surrounded by\r\nbeautiful gardens, glowing at this season with the scarlet leaves of the\r\nPoinsettia, or “Estrella do Norte” as they call it here, with blue and\r\nyellow Bignonias, and many other shrubs and vines, the names of which we\r\nhave hardly learned as yet. Often, as we drove along, a wide gateway,\r\nopening into an avenue of palms, would give us a glimpse of Brazilian\r\nlife. Here and there a group of people were sitting in the garden, or\r\nchildren were playing in the grounds under the care of their black\r\nnurses. Farther out of town the country houses were less numerous, but\r\nthe scenery was more picturesque. The road winds immediately under the\r\nmountains to the foot of the Corcovado, where it becomes too steep for\r\ncarriages, the farther ascent being made on mules or horses. But it was\r\ntoo late for us,—the peak of the Corcovado was already bathed in the\r\nsetting sun. We wandered a little way up the romantic path, gathered a\r\nfew flowers, and then drove back to the city, stopping on our return to\r\nramble for half an hour in the “Passeio Publico.” This is a pretty\r\npublic garden on the bay, not large but tastefully laid out, its great\r\ncharm being a broad promenade built up from the water’s edge with very\r\nsolid masonry, against which the waves break with a refreshing coolness.\r\nTo-morrow we are invited by Major Ellison, chief engineer of the Dom\r\nPedro Railroad, to go out to the terminus of the road, some hundred\r\nmiles through the heart of the Serra do Mar.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tree entwined by Sipos.]\r\n\r\n_April 27th._—Perhaps in all our journeyings through Brazil we shall not\r\nhave a day more impressive to us all than this one; we shall, no doubt,\r\nsee wilder scenery, but the first time that one looks upon nature, under\r\nan entirely new aspect, has a charm that can hardly be repeated. The\r\nfirst view of high mountains, the first glimpse of the broad ocean, the\r\nfirst sight of a tropical vegetation in all its fulness, are epochs in\r\none’s life. This wonderful South American forest is so matted together\r\nand intertwined with gigantic parasites that it seems more like a solid,\r\ncompact mass of green than like the leafy screen, vibrating with every\r\nbreeze and transparent to the sun, which represents the forest in the\r\ntemperate zone. Many of the trees in the region we passed through to-day\r\nseemed in the embrace of immense serpents, so large were the stems of\r\nthe parasites winding about them; orchids of various kinds and large\r\nsize grew upon their trunks; and vines climbed to their summits and\r\nthrew themselves down in garlands to the ground. On the embankments also\r\nbetween which we passed, vines of many varieties were creeping down, as\r\nif they would fain clothe in green garments the ugly gaps the railroad\r\nhad made. Yet it must be confessed that, in this instance, the railroad\r\nhas not destroyed, but rather heightened, the picturesque scenery,\r\ncutting, as it does, through passes which give beautiful vistas into the\r\nheart of the mountain range. Once, as we issued from a tunnel, where the\r\ndarkness seemed tangible, upon an exquisite landscape all gleaming in\r\nthe sunshine, a general shout from the whole party testified their\r\nastonishment and admiration. We were riding on an open car in front of\r\nthe engine, so that nothing impeded our view, and we had no\r\ninconvenience from smoke or cinders. During the latter part of the ride\r\nwe came into the region of the most valuable coffee-plantations; and\r\nindeed the road is chiefly supported by the transportation of the\r\nimmense quantities of coffee raised along its track or beyond it. Near\r\nits terminus is an extensive fazenda, from which we were told that five\r\nor six hundred tons of coffee are sent out in a good year. These\r\nfazendas are singular-looking establishments, low (usually only one\r\nstory) and very spreading, the largest of them covering quite an\r\nextensive area. As they are rather isolated in situation, they must\r\ninclude within their own borders all that is needed to keep them up.\r\nThere is something very primitive in the way of life of these great\r\ncountry proprietors. Major Ellison told me that some time ago a wealthy\r\nMarqueza living at some distance beyond him in the interior, and going\r\nto town for a stay of a few weeks, stopped at his house to rest. She had\r\na troop of thirty-one pack-mules, laden with all conceivable baggage,\r\nbesides provisions of every sort, fowls, hams, &c., and a train of\r\ntwenty-five servants. Their hospitality is said to be unbounded; you\r\nhave only to present yourself at their gates at the end of a day’s\r\njourney, and if you have the air of a respectable traveller, you are\r\nsure of a hearty welcome, shelter and food. The card of a friend or a\r\nnote of introduction insures you all the house can afford for as long as\r\nyou like to stay.\r\n\r\nThe last three miles of our journey was over what is called the\r\n“temporary road,” the use of which will be discontinued as soon as the\r\ngreat tunnel is completed. I must say, that to the inexperienced this\r\nroad looks exceedingly perilous, especially that part of it which is\r\ncarried over a wooden bridge 65 feet high, with a very strong curvature\r\nand a gradient of 4 per cent (211 feet per mile). As you feel the engine\r\nlaboring up the steep ascent, and, looking out, find yourself on the\r\nedge of a precipitous bank, and almost face to face with the hindmost\r\ncar, while the train bends around the curve, it is difficult to resist\r\nthe sense of insecurity. It is certainly greatly to the credit of the\r\nmanagement of the line that no accident has occurred under circumstances\r\nwhere the least carelessness would be fatal.[17]\r\n\r\nIt gives one an idea of the labor expended on this railroad, to learn\r\nthat for the great tunnel alone, now almost completed (one of fourteen),\r\na corps of some three hundred men, relieving each other alternately,\r\nhave been at work day and night, excepting Sundays, for seven years. The\r\nsound of hammer and pick during that time has hardly ever been still,\r\nand so hard is the rock through which the tunnel is pierced, that often\r\nthe heaviest blows of the sledge yield only a little dust,—no more in\r\nbulk than a pinch of snuff.[18]\r\n\r\nOn our return we were detained for half an hour at a station on the bank\r\nof the river Parahyba. This first visit to one of the considerable\r\nrivers of Brazil was not without its memorable incident. One of our\r\nfriends of the Colorado, who parts from us here on his way to San\r\nFrancisco, said he was determined not to leave the expedition without\r\ncontributing something to its results. He improvised a fishing\r\napparatus, with a stick, a string, and a crooked pin, and caught two\r\nfishes, our first harvest from the fresh waters of Brazil, one of which\r\nwas entirely new to Mr. Agassiz, while the other he had never seen, and\r\nonly knew from descriptions.\r\n\r\n_April 28th._—This morning we went over to the Colorado, which still\r\nlies in the harbor, and where the visit of the Emperor was expected. We\r\nall felt an interest in the occasion, for we have a kind of personal\r\npride in the fine ship whose first voyage has been the source of so much\r\nenjoyment to us. The Imperial yacht arrived punctually at twelve\r\no’clock, and was received by the captain with a full salute from his\r\nParrott guns, fired with a promptness and accuracy which the Emperor did\r\nnot fail to notice. His Majesty went over the whole steamer; and really\r\nan exploring expedition over such a world in little, with its\r\nprovision-shops, its cattle stalls, its pantries and sculleries, its\r\nendless accommodations for passengers and freight, its variety of decks\r\nand its great central fires, deep below all, is no contemptible journey\r\nfor a tropical morning. The arrangements of the vessel seemed to excite\r\nthe interest and admiration both of the Emperor and his suite. Captain\r\nBradbury invited his Majesty to lunch on board; he very cordially\r\naccepted, and remained some time afterward, conversing chiefly about\r\nscientific subjects, and especially on matters connected with the\r\nexpedition. The Emperor is still a young man; but though only forty, he\r\nhas been the reigning sovereign of Brazil for more than half that time,\r\nand he looks careworn and somewhat older than his years. He has a\r\ndignified, manly presence, a face rather stern in repose, but animated\r\nand genial in conversation; his manner is courteous and friendly to all.\r\n\r\n_May 1st._—We celebrated May-day in a strange land, where May ushers in\r\nthe winter, by driving to the Botanical Garden. When I say we, I mean\r\nusually the unprofessional members of the party. The scientific corps\r\nare too busily engaged to be with us on many of our little pleasure\r\nexcursions. Mr. Agassiz himself is chiefly occupied in seeing numerous\r\npersons in official positions, whose influence is important in matters\r\nrelative to the expedition. He is very anxious to complete these\r\nnecessary preliminaries, to despatch his various parties into the\r\ninterior, and to begin his personal investigations. He is commended to\r\nbe patient, however, and not to fret at delays; for, with the best will\r\nin the world, the dilatory national habits cannot be changed. Meanwhile\r\nhe has improvised a laboratory in a large empty room over a warehouse in\r\nthe Rua Direita, the principal business street of the city. Here in one\r\ncorner the ornithologists, Mr. Dexter and Mr. Allen, have their bench,—a\r\nrough board propped on two casks, the seat an empty keg; in another, Mr.\r\nAnthony, with an apparatus of much the same kind, pores over his shells;\r\na dissecting-table of like carpentry occupies a conspicuous position;\r\nand in the midst the Professor may generally be seen sitting on a\r\nbarrel, for chairs there are none, assorting or examining specimens, or\r\ngoing from bench to bench to see how the work progresses. In the midst\r\nof the confusion Mr. Burkhardt has his little table, where he is making\r\ncolored drawings of the fish as they are brought in fresh from the\r\nfishing-boats. In a small adjoining room Mr. Sceva is preparing\r\nskeletons for mounting. Every one, in short, has his special task and is\r\nbusily at work. A very questionable perfume, an “ancient and fish-like\r\nsmell,” strongly tinged with alcohol, guides one to this abode of\r\nScience, where, notwithstanding its unattractive aspect, Mr. Agassiz\r\nreceives many visitors, curious to see the actual working process of a\r\nlaboratory of Natural History, and full of interest in the expedition.\r\nHere also pour in specimens from all quarters and of every kind;\r\nvoluntary contributions, which daily swell the collections.[19] Those of\r\nthe party who are not engaged here have their work elsewhere. Mr. Hartt\r\nand Mr. St. John are at various stations along the railroad line, making\r\ngeological sections of the road; several of the volunteers are\r\ncollecting in the country, and Mr. Hunnewell is studying at a\r\nphotographic establishment, fitting himself to assist Mr. Agassiz in\r\nthis way when we are beyond the reach of professional artists.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Side View of the Alley of Palms.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Vista down the Alley of Palms.]\r\n\r\nOur excursion of to-day took us to another of those exquisite drives in\r\nthe neighborhood of the city, always along the harbor or some inlet of\r\nit, always in sight of the mountains, always bordered by pretty country\r\nhouses and gardens. The Botanical Garden is about eight miles from the\r\ncentre of the town. It is beautiful, because the situation is admirably\r\nwell chosen, and because anything that calls itself a garden can hardly\r\nfail to be beautiful in a climate where growth is so luxuriant. But it\r\nis not kept with great care. Indeed, the very readiness with which\r\nplants respond to the least culture bestowed upon them here makes it\r\nvery difficult to keep grounds in that trim order which we think so\r\nessential. This garden boasts, however, one feature as unique as it is\r\nbeautiful, in its long avenue of palms, some eighty feet in height. I\r\nwish it were possible to give in words the faintest idea of the\r\narchitectural beauty of this colonnade of palms, with their green crowns\r\nmeeting to form the roof. Straight, firm, and smooth as stone columns, a\r\ndim vision of colonnades in some ancient Egyptian temple rises to the\r\nimagination as one looks down the long vista.[20]\r\n\r\n_May 6th._—Yesterday, at the invitation of our friend Mr. B——, we\r\nascended the famous Corcovado peak. Leaving the carriages at the\r\nterminus of the Larangeiras road, we made the farther ascent on\r\nhorseback by a winding narrow path, which, though a very fair road for\r\nmountain travelling in ordinary weather, had been made exceedingly\r\nslippery by the late rains. The ride was lovely through the fragrant\r\nforest, with enchanting glimpses of view here and there, giving promise\r\nof what was before us. Occasionally a brook or a little cascade made\r\npleasant music by the roadside, and when we stopped to rest our horses\r\nwe heard the wind rustle softly in the stiff palms overhead. The beauty\r\nof vegetation is enhanced here by the singular character of the soil.\r\nThe color of the earth is peculiar all about Rio; of a rich warm red, it\r\nseems to glow beneath the mass of vines and large-leaved plants above\r\nit, and every now and then crops out in vivid, striking contrast to the\r\nsurrounding verdure. Frequently our path followed the base of such a\r\nbank, its deep ochre and vermilion tints looking all the softer for\r\ntheir framework of green. Among the larger growth, the Candelabra-tree\r\n(_Cecropia_) was conspicuous. The strangely regular structure of the\r\nbranches and its silvery-tinted foliage make it stand out in bold relief\r\nfrom the darker background. It is a striking feature of the forest in\r\nthis neighborhood.\r\n\r\nA wide panoramic prospect always eludes description, but certainly few\r\ncan combine such rare elements of beauty as the one from the summit of\r\nthe Corcovado. The immense landlocked harbor, with its gateway open to\r\nthe sea, the broad ocean beyond, the many islands, the circle of\r\nmountains with soft fleecy clouds floating about the nearer peaks,—all\r\nthese features make a wonderful picture. One great charm of this\r\nlandscape consists in the fact, that, though very extensive, it is not\r\nso distant as to deprive objects of their individuality. After all, a\r\nvery distant view is something like an inventory: so many dark, green\r\npatches, forests; so many lighter green patches, fields; so many white\r\nspots, lakes; so many silver threads, rivers, &c. But here special\r\neffects are not lost in the grandeur of the whole. On the extreme peak\r\nof the height a wall has been built around the edge, the descent on one\r\nside being so vertical that a false step might hurl one to instant\r\ndestruction. At this wall we dismounted and lingered long, unwilling to\r\nleave the beautiful view before sunset. We were, however, anxious to\r\nreturn by daylight, and, to confess the truth, being a timorous and\r\ninexperienced rider at best, I was not without some anxiety as to the\r\ndescent, for the latter part of the slippery road had been a sheer\r\nscramble. Putting a bold face on the matter, however, I resumed my seat,\r\ntrying to look as if it were my habit to mount horses on the tops of\r\nhigh mountains and slide down to the bottom. This is really no\r\ninaccurate description of our descent for the first ten minutes, after\r\nwhich we regained the more level path at the little station called “the\r\nPaïneiras.” We are told to-day that parties usually leave their horses\r\nat this station and ascend the rest of the way on foot, the road beyond\r\nthat being so steep that it is considered unsafe for riding. However, we\r\nreached the plain without accident, and I look back upon yesterday’s\r\nride with some complacency as a first lesson in mountain travelling.[21]\r\n\r\n_May 20th._—On Friday, the 12th of May, we left Rio on our first\r\nexcursion of any length. A day or two after our arrival Mr. Agassiz had\r\nreceived an invitation from the President of the Union and Industry\r\nCompany to go with some of his party over their road from Petropolis to\r\nJuiz de Fora, in the Province of Minas Geräes, a road celebrated not\r\nonly for the beauty of its scenery, but also for its own excellence. A\r\nword as to the circumstances under which it has been built may not be\r\namiss here; and it must be confessed, that, if the Brazilians are, as\r\nthey are said to be, slow in their progress, the improvements they do\r\nundertake are carried out with great thoroughness. It is true that the\r\nconstruction of the road has been intrusted to French engineers, but the\r\nleading man in its projection and ultimate completion has been a\r\nBrazilian, Senhor Mariano Procopio Ferreira Lage, a native of the\r\nprovince of Minas Geräes. This province is said to be remarkable for the\r\ngreat energy and intelligence of its inhabitants, as compared with those\r\nof the adjoining provinces. Perhaps this may be owing to its cooler\r\nclimate, most of its towns lying among the highlands of the Serras, and\r\nenjoying a fresher, more stimulating air than those nearer the\r\nsea-coast. Before undertaking the building of this road, Senhor Lage\r\ntravelled both in Europe and America with the purpose of learning all\r\nthe modern improvements in works of a similar character. The result\r\nbears testimony to the energy and patience with which he has carried out\r\nhis project.[22] Twelve years ago the only means of going into the\r\ninterior from Petropolis was through narrow, dangerous, broken\r\nmule-tracks, and a journey of a hundred miles involved a difficult ride\r\nof three or four days. Now one travels from Petropolis to Juiz de Fora\r\nbetween sunrise and sunset over a post-road equal to any in the world,\r\nchanging mules every ten or twelve miles at pretty little stations,\r\nbuilt somewhat in the style of Swiss châlets, each one of which is a\r\nsettlement for the German colonists who have been induced to come out as\r\nworkmen on the road. This emigration in itself is a great advantage to\r\nthe country; wherever these little German villages occur, nestled down\r\namong the hills, there are the neat vegetable and flower gardens, the\r\ntidy houses, the general aspect of thrift and comfort, so characteristic\r\nof the better classes of the German peasantry. Nominally no slaves are\r\nallowed on the service of the road, Portuguese and German workmen being\r\nchiefly employed. This is a regulation which applies not only here, but\r\non other public works about Rio. The contracts granted by the government\r\nexpressly exclude the employment of slaves, though unfortunately this\r\nrule is not adhered to strictly, because for the performance of certain\r\nkinds of work no substitute for slave labor has yet been found. In the\r\ndirect care of the road, however, in the repairs, for instance,\r\nrequiring gangs of men who are constantly at work blasting rock and\r\ncracking the fragments into small pieces for the fresh macadamizing of\r\nany imperfect spot, mending any defects in the embankments or walls,\r\n&c., none but free labor is employed.\r\n\r\nThis attempt to exclude slaves from the public works is an emancipation\r\nmovement, undertaken with the idea of gradually limiting slave labor to\r\nagricultural processes, and ridding the large cities and their\r\nneighborhood of the presence of slavery. The subject of emancipation is\r\nno such political bugbear here as it has been with us. It is very\r\nliberally and calmly discussed by all classes; the general feeling is\r\nagainst the institution, and it seems to be taken for granted that it\r\nwill disappear before many years are over. During this very session of\r\nthe Assembly one or two bills for emancipation have been brought\r\nforward. Even now any enterprising negro may obtain his freedom, and,\r\nonce obtained, there is no obstacle to his rising in social or political\r\nstation. But while from this point of view slavery is less absolute than\r\nit was with us, it has some appalling aspects. The slaves, at least in\r\nthe cities, are literally beasts of burden. One sees the most cumbersome\r\nfurniture,—pianos and the like, and the heaviest trunks or barrels,\r\npiled one on top of the other, or bales of sugar and coffee weighing\r\nhundreds of pounds,—moving about the streets on the heads of the\r\nnegroes. The result of this is that their limbs often become crippled,\r\nand it is common to see negroes in the prime of life who are quite\r\ncrooked and maimed, and can hardly walk without a stick to lean upon. In\r\njustice I must add, however, that this practice, though it shocks a\r\nstranger even now, is gradually disappearing. We are told that a few\r\nyears ago there were hardly any baggage-wagons except these living ones,\r\nand that the habit of using the blacks in this way is going out of\r\nvogue. In this as in other matters the Emperor’s opinions are those of\r\nan enlightened and humane man, and were his power equal to his will,\r\nslavery would vanish from his dominions at once. He is, however, too\r\nwise not to know that all great social changes must be gradual; but he\r\nopenly declares his abhorrence of the system.[23]\r\n\r\nBut to return from this digression to the road of the Union and Industry\r\nCompany. It is now completed as far as Juiz de Fora, affording every\r\nconvenience for the transport of the rich harvest of coffee constantly\r\ntravelling over it from all the fazendas in the region. As the whole\r\ndistrict is very rich in coffee-plantations, the improvement in the\r\nmeans of transportation is of course very important to the commercial\r\ninterests of the country, and Senhor Lage is making practicable roads to\r\nthe smallest settlements in his neighborhood. He has not, however, been\r\nfree from the difficulties which men encounter whose schemes are in\r\nadvance of their surroundings. No doubt a great part of the\r\ndissatisfaction is owing to the fact that the road is not so\r\nremunerative as was anticipated, the advance of the Dom Pedro Railroad\r\nhaving impaired its success. Still it must be considered as a monument\r\nto the public spirit and energy of the men who undertook it. Not wishing\r\nto interrupt the course of the narrative, I have thought it best to\r\npreface the story of our journey by some account of this road, the\r\nbuilding of which is a significant fact in the present history of\r\nBrazil. I will now take up again the thread of our personal adventures.\r\n\r\nLeaving the city at two o’clock in the ferry-boat, we kept up the harbor\r\nsome fifteen miles. There was a cool breeze, and the day, though warm,\r\nwas not oppressive. Passing the large Ilha do Governador, the smaller\r\nbut exceedingly pretty island of Paqueta, and many others, with their\r\npalms, banana and acacia trees, dotting the harbor of Rio and adding\r\nanother grace to its beauty, we landed in about an hour and a quarter at\r\nthe little town of Mauá.[24] Here we took the cars, and an hour’s ride\r\nthrough low and marshy grounds brought us to the foot of the Serra\r\n(_Raiz da Serra_), where we left the railroad for the post-coach, which\r\nruns regularly from this station. The drive was delightful, in an open\r\ndiligence drawn by four mules on the full gallop over a road as smooth\r\nas a floor. It wound zigzag up the mountains, through the wildest\r\nscenery, while below us lay the valley broken into a billowy sea of\r\ngreen hills, and the harbor with the coast range beyond, growing soft\r\nand mellow in the afternoon sunshine. To complete the picture, one must\r\nclothe it in palms and acacias and tree-ferns, and drape it in a tangle\r\nof parasitic growth, with abundant bloom of the purple Quaresma (Flower\r\nof Lent),[25] the Thunbergia vine, with its little straw-colored\r\nblossoms creeping over every wall and shrub, and the blue and yellow\r\nBignonias. We are constantly astonished at the variety of palms. A palm\r\nis such a rarity in our hot-houses, that we easily forget how numerous\r\nand varied they are in their native forests. We have the scarlet-oak,\r\nthe white-oak, the scrub-oak, the chestnut-oak, the swamp-oak, and many\r\nothers. And so in the tropical forest there is the cocoanut-palm, with\r\nits swollen, bulb-like stem when young, its tall, straight trunk when\r\nfull grown, its cluster of heavy fruit, and its long, plume-like,\r\ndrooping flower;[26] the Coccoeiro, with its slighter trunk and pendant\r\nbranches of small berry-like fruit; the Palmetto, with its tender\r\nsucculent bud on the summit of the stem, which is used as a vegetable\r\nhere, and makes an excellent substitute for cabbage; the thorny Icaree\r\nor Cari, a variety of fan-palms, with their leaves cut like ribbons; and\r\nvery many others, each with its characteristic foliage and\r\nappearance.[27]\r\n\r\nThe mountains along the road, as indeed throughout the neighborhood of\r\nRio, are of very peculiar forms, steep and conical, suggesting at first\r\nsight a volcanic origin. It is this abruptness of outline which gives so\r\nmuch grandeur to mountain ranges here, the average height of which does\r\nnot exceed two or three thousand feet. A closer examination of their\r\nstructure shows that their wild, fantastic forms are the result of the\r\nslow processes of disintegration, not of sudden convulsions. Indeed, the\r\nrocks here differ so much in external character from those of the\r\nNorthern Hemisphere, that the European geologist stands at first\r\nbewildered before them, and feels that the work of his life is to be\r\ndone over again. It is some time before he obtains a clew to the facts\r\nand brings them into harmony with his previous knowledge. Thus far Mr.\r\nAgassiz finds himself painfully perplexed by this new aspect of\r\nphenomena so familiar to him in other regions, but so baffling here. He\r\ncomes upon a rock, for instance, or a rounded elevation which by its\r\noutline he would suppose to be a “roche moutonnée,” but approaching it\r\nmore nearly he finds a decomposed crust instead of a glaciated surface.\r\nIt is the same with the loose materials corresponding to the drift of\r\nthe Northern hemisphere, and with all boulders or detached masses of\r\nrock; on account of their disintegration wherever they are exposed to\r\nthe atmosphere, nothing is to be learned from their external appearance.\r\nThere is not a natural surface of rock, unless recently broken, to be\r\nfound anywhere.\r\n\r\nThe sun had set before we drove into the pretty town of Petropolis, the\r\nsummer paradise of all Rio Janeirans whose circumstances enable them to\r\nleave the heat and dirt and vile smells of the city, for the pure air\r\nand enchanting views of the Serra. In a central position stands the\r\nsummer palace of the Emperor, a far gayer and more cheerful-looking\r\nedifice than the palace at San Christovāo. Here he passes six months of\r\nthe year. Through the midst of the town runs the pretty river Piabanha,\r\na shallow stream, now rippling along in the bottom of its bed between\r\nhigh green banks; but we were told that a night of rain in the hot\r\nseason is enough to swell its waters till they overflow and flood the\r\nroad. I could not but think how easy it would be for any one who cares\r\nto see tropical scenery to come here, when the direct line of steamers\r\nfrom New York is established, and, instead of going to Newport or\r\nNahant, to take a house in Petropolis for the summer. It commands all\r\nthe most beautiful scenery about Rio, and the horseback rides are\r\nwithout end. During our summer the weather is delightful here, just\r\nadmitting a semblance of wood-fire morning and evening, while the orange\r\norchards are golden with fruit, and flowers are everywhere. We had\r\nlittle time to become acquainted with the beauty of the place, which we\r\nhope to explore more at our leisure on some future visit, for sunrise\r\nthe next morning saw us on our road again. The soft clouds hanging over\r\nthe tops of the mountains were just tinged with the first rays of the\r\nsun when we drove out of the town on the top of the diligence, the mules\r\nat full gallop, the guard sounding a gay reveille as we rattled over the\r\nlittle bridge and past the pretty houses where closed windows and doors\r\nshowed that the inhabitants were hardly yet astir.\r\n\r\nThe first part of our road lay through the lovely valley of the\r\nPiabanha, the river whose acquaintance we had already made in\r\nPetropolis, and which accompanied us for the first forty or fifty miles\r\nof our journey, sometimes a restless stream broken into rapids and\r\ncascades, sometimes spreading into a broad, placid river, but always\r\nenclosed between mountains rising occasionally to the height of a few\r\nthousand feet, lifting here and there a bare rocky face seamed with a\r\nthousand scars of time and studded with Bromelias and Orchids, but more\r\noften clothed with all the glory of the Southern forest, or covered from\r\nbase to summit with coffee shrubs. A thriving coffee plantation is a\r\nvery pretty sight; the rounded, regular outline of the shrubs gives a\r\ntufted look to the hillside on which they grow, and their glittering\r\nfoliage contrasts strikingly at this season with their bright red\r\nberries. One often passes coffee plantations, however, which look ragged\r\nand thin; in this case the trees are either suffering from the peculiar\r\ninsect so injurious to them, (a kind of Tinea,) or have run out and\r\nbecome exhausted. As we drove along, the scenes upon the road were often\r\nas amusing as they were picturesque. Now we came upon a troop of pack\r\nmules with a _tropeiro_ (driver) at their head; if a large troop, they\r\nwere divided into companies of eight, with a man to guide each company.\r\nThe guard wound his horn to give warning of our coming, and a general\r\nstruggle, garnished with kicks, oaths, and many lashes, ensued, to\r\ninduce the mules to make way for the coach. These troops of mules are\r\nbeginning to disappear from the seaboard since the modern improvements\r\nin railroads and stage lines, making transportation so much easier; but\r\nuntil lately it was the only way of bringing down the produce from the\r\ninterior. Or again we fell in with a line of country wagons made of\r\nplaited bamboo, a kind of fabric which is put to a variety of uses here,\r\nsuch as the building of fences and lining of ceilings or roofs, as well\r\nas the construction of carts. Here and there the laborers were sitting\r\nin groups at the roadside, their work suspended while they cooked their\r\nmidday meal, their kettles hanging over the fire, their coffee-pot\r\nsimmering over the coals, and they themselves lying about in gypsy-like\r\nfreedom of attitude.\r\n\r\nAt Posse, the third stage of our road, after having gone some thirty\r\nmiles, we also stopped to breakfast, a meal which was by no means\r\nunacceptable after our three hours’ ride. It is an almost universal\r\ncustom with the Brazilians, especially when travelling, to take their\r\ncup of black coffee on rising, and defer their more solid breakfast till\r\nten or eleven o’clock. I do not know whether my readers will sympathize\r\nwith me, but I am always disappointed myself if any book of travels,\r\nhaving led me along the weary road, does not tell me what the hungry\r\nwanderers had to eat. It seems hardly fair, having shared their\r\nfatigues, that I should not also share their refreshment and be invited\r\nto sit down at table with them. Doing, therefore, as I would be done by,\r\nI shall give our bill of fare, and take an opportunity of saying a word\r\nat the same time of the characteristic Brazilian dishes. In the first\r\nplace we had black beans stewed with _carne secca_ (dried meat), the\r\ninvariable accompaniment of every meal in Brazil. There is no house so\r\npoor that it does not have its _feijōes_, no house so rich as to exclude\r\nthis homely but most excellent dish, a favorite alike with high and low.\r\nThen there was chicken stewed with potatoes and rice, almost as marked a\r\nfeature of the Brazilian cuisine as the black beans. Beside these, there\r\nwere eggs served in various ways, cold meat, wine, coffee, and bread.\r\nVegetables seem to be rare, though one would expect a plentiful variety\r\nin this climate.[28] At Posse Mr. Agassiz found a cordial co-operator in\r\nMr. Charles Taylor, who expressed a warm interest in his scientific\r\nresearches, and kept one of the collecting cans that he might fill it\r\nwith fishes from the neighboring rivers and streams.[29]\r\n\r\nOur kind friend Senhor Joaō Baptista da Fonseca, who was our guide and\r\nour host on this journey, had neglected nothing which could contribute\r\nto the success and pleasure of the party, and had so prepared the way\r\nfor the scientific objects of the excursion that at several points of\r\nthe road we found collections of fishes and other animals awaiting us by\r\nthe roadside. Once or twice, as we passed a fazenda, a negro carrying a\r\nbasket came out to stop the diligence, and, lifting the cool green\r\nleaves which covered them, showed freshly caught fishes of all hues and\r\nsizes. It was rather aggravating, especially as we approached the end of\r\nour long drive, and the idea of dinner readily suggested itself, to see\r\nthem disappear in the alcohol cans.[30]\r\n\r\nAt about midday we bade good by to the pretty river we had followed thus\r\nfar, and at the Estaçaō d’Entre Rios (between the rivers) crossed the\r\nfine bridge which spans the Parahyba at this point. The Parahyba is the\r\nlarge river which flows for a great part of its course between the Serra\r\ndo Mar and the Serra da Mantiqueira, emptying into the Atlantic at San\r\nJoaō da Barra considerably to the northeast of Rio de Janeiro. One is a\r\nlittle bewildered at first by the variety of Serras in Brazil, because\r\nthe word is used to express not only important chains of mountains, but\r\nall their spurs. Any mountainous elevation is a Serra; but though there\r\nis an endless number of them between the Serra do Mar and the Serra da\r\nMantiqueira, these are the two most important chains, running parallel\r\nwith the sea-coast. Between them flows the Parahyba with its many\r\nbranches. It is important to make collections here, as the peculiar\r\ncharacter of this water basin, the many tributaries of which drain the\r\nsouthern water-shed of the Serra da Mantiqueira, and the northern\r\nwater-shed of the Serra do Mar, make it of especial interest for the\r\nnaturalist. On account of its neighborhood to the sea, it is also\r\ndesirable to compare its inhabitants with those of the many short,\r\ndisconnected rivers which empty into the Atlantic on the other side of\r\nthe coast range. In short, it gives a good opportunity for testing those\r\nquestions of the geographical distribution of living beings, as\r\nconnected with their origin, which Mr. Agassiz so strongly urged upon\r\nhis assistants during our voyage.\r\n\r\nSoon after crossing the Parahyba, the road strikes the Parahybuna, a\r\ntributary which enters the main river on its northern side, nearly\r\nopposite the Piabanha. The latter part of the journey is less wild than\r\nthe first half; the mountains fall away in somewhat gentler slopes, and\r\ndo not shut in the road with the steep rugged precipices so striking in\r\nthe valley of the Piabanha. But though perhaps less picturesque on\r\napproaching Juiz de Fora,[31] the scenery is beautiful enough throughout\r\nthe whole ride to satisfy the most fastidious and keep the attention\r\nconstantly awake. We arrived at the end of our journey at about six\r\no’clock, and found most comfortable accommodations prepared for us at a\r\nlittle cottage, built somewhat in the style of a Swiss châlet, and kept\r\nby the company for the use of their guests or for the directors of the\r\nroad. An excellent dinner awaited us at the little hotel just opposite,\r\nthe door of which is shaded by two stately palms; and with a ramble in\r\nthe neighboring grounds of Senhor Lage, and a concert by a band of\r\nGerman musicians, consisting of employees on the road, our day closed,—a\r\nday full of pleasure.\r\n\r\nThe following morning we were indebted to Senhor Lage for a walk, as\r\ninstructive as it was charming, through his gardens and orange orchards.\r\nNot only has he arranged his grounds with exquisite taste, but has\r\nendeavored to bring together the shrubs and trees most characteristic of\r\nthe country, so that a stroll through his place is a valuable lesson to\r\nthe botanist, the more so if he is fortunate enough to have the\r\nproprietor as a companion, for he may then learn the name and history of\r\nevery tree and flower he passes. Such a guide is invaluable here, for\r\nthe Brazilians seem to remain in blissful ignorance of systematic\r\nnomenclature; to most of them all flowers are “flores,” all animals,\r\nfrom a fly up to a mule or an elephant, “bixos.” One of the most\r\nbeautiful features of Senhor Lage’s grounds is a plantation of\r\nparasites,—an extensive walk, bordered on either side by a rustic fence,\r\nover which are trained some of the most exquisite parasitic plants of\r\nthe Brazilian forests. In the midst of this walk is the Grotto of the\r\nPrincesses, so called after the daughters of the Emperor who, on\r\noccasion of a visit made by the Imperial family to Juiz de Fora, at the\r\nopening of the road, were exceedingly pleased with this pretty spot,\r\nwhere a spring all overhung with parasitic vines, orchids, &c. flows out\r\nfrom the rock. The spring, however, is artificial, and is a part of the\r\nadmirable system of irrigation introduced over the whole estate. So\r\nrapid is the growth of everything here that one can hardly believe this\r\nbeautiful country place to have been under cultivation only five or six\r\nyears; a few years more under the same direction will make it a tropical\r\nparadise.\r\n\r\nA variety of plans combining pleasure and science had been arranged for\r\nthe next day. First on the list was a drive to the “Forest of the\r\nEmpress.” Everything of any interest in the neighborhood recalls the\r\nvisit of the Imperial family at the opening of the road. From this event\r\nall loyal Juiz de Forans date, and the virgin forest we were to visit is\r\nconsecrated by the fact that on this great occasion the Emperor with his\r\nfamily and suite breakfasted here in presence of a numerous assemblage\r\nof their loving subjects. Surely a more stately banqueting-hall could\r\nscarcely be found. The throne was cut in the broad buttressed trunk of a\r\nhuge figueira; the rustic table, built of rough stems, stood under the\r\nshadow of great palm-trees; and around was the tropical forest,\r\ntapestried with vines, and embroidered with Orchids. These were royal\r\naccompaniments, even though the whole entertainment was conducted with a\r\nsimplicity in harmony with the scene. Neither gold nor silver nor glass\r\nwas brought to vie with the beauties of nature; the drinking-cups were\r\nmade from the hollow stems of the wild bamboo-tree, and all the service\r\nwas of the same rustic description. The tables, seats, &c. stand,\r\nundisturbed, as they were on that day, and of course this spot remains a\r\nfavorite resort for humbler picnics than the one by which it was\r\ninaugurated. We wandered about for some time in the cool shade of the\r\nwood, lunched under the rustling palms, and then drove homeward,\r\nstopping for a while by the side of the river, where a pretty cascade\r\nrushes over the stones, and a rustic house built for the same memorable\r\noccurrence makes a pleasant resting-place. In the afternoon a heavy rain\r\nkept us within doors, but we were not sorry, for we were in danger of\r\nhaving a surfeit of pleasure, and quiet was very grateful.\r\n\r\nA great part of our last day at Juiz de Fora was spent at the hospitable\r\nhouse of Mr. Halfeld, the German engineer who has gained an honorable\r\ndistinction by his explorations in the interior. His work on the Rio San\r\nFrancisco was well known to Mr. Agassiz, so that they found themselves\r\nat once on familiar ground, and Mr. Halfeld was able to give him a great\r\ndeal of valuable information respecting the prospects of the present\r\nexpedition, especially that department of it which will go to the\r\nAmazons by way of the Rio San Francisco and the Tocantins. He has also\r\nan interesting collection of objects of natural history, and cordially\r\noffered his assistance in obtaining the fishes of the neighborhood. As\r\nfor the collections, they had been going on famously during our whole\r\nvisit. We had hardly been in Juiz de Fora twenty-four hours before a\r\ndozen collectors were actively at work. All the urchins of the\r\nneighborhood and many of the Germans employed on the road lent a helping\r\nhand. Even the ladies did their full share, and Mr. Agassiz was indebted\r\nto our friend Mrs. K—— for some of the most interesting specimens from\r\nthis locality. No doubt such as were left of the “bixos” of Juiz de Fora\r\nmust have congratulated themselves on our departure the following\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nWe enjoyed our return over the same road scarcely less than our first\r\nintroduction to it; but the latter part of the day was full of an\r\ninterest which touched us more nearly. At Posse, where we had\r\nbreakfasted on our way up, Mr. Taylor welcomed us with a Portuguese\r\npaper containing a bulletin announcing the great victories of the North.\r\nPetersburg and Richmond taken,—Lee in full retreat,—the war virtually\r\nover. This was the substance of the news received with delight and\r\nacclamation, not without tears of gratitude also, and we went on our way\r\nrejoicing. As we drove up to the Hotel Inglez after dark that evening,\r\nhoping to get a glimpse of an American paper, or at least to have the\r\ngood news confirmed through the American Minister, General Webb, whose\r\nresidence is at Petropolis, we were greeted by the announcement of the\r\nassassination of Lincoln and Seward, both believed at this time to be\r\ndead. At first it seemed absolutely incredible, and the more sanguine\r\namong us persisted in regarding it as a gigantic street rumor, invented\r\nperhaps by Secession sympathizers, till on our return to town the next\r\nmorning our worst fears were confirmed by the French steamer just\r\narrived. The days seemed very long till the next mail, which reassured\r\nus somewhat, as it brought the news of Mr. Seward’s probable recovery\r\nand strengthened our faith in the stability of the national character.\r\nAll the accounts, public and private, assure us that, though there is\r\nmourning throughout the land, there is no disturbance of the general\r\nregularity and order.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 16:\r\n\r\n  The winter palace of the Emperor.\r\n\r\nFootnote 17:\r\n\r\n  Some weeks after this I chanced to ask a beautiful young Brazilian\r\n  woman, recently married, whether she had ever been over this temporary\r\n  road for the sake of seeing the picturesque scenery. “No,” she\r\n  answered with perfect seriousness, “I am young and very happy, and I\r\n  do not wish to die yet.” It was an amusing comment on the Brazilian\r\n  estimate of the dangers attending the journey.\r\n\r\nFootnote 18:\r\n\r\n  This road, which is but the beginning of railroad travel in Brazil,\r\n  opens a rich prospect for scientific study. From this time forward the\r\n  difficulty of transporting collections from the interior to the\r\n  seaboard will be diminishing. Instead of the few small specimens of\r\n  tropical vegetation now preserved in our museums, I hope that\r\n  hereafter, in every school where geology and palæontology are taught,\r\n  we shall have large stems and portions of trunks to show the structure\r\n  of palms, tree-ferns, and the like,—trees which represent in modern\r\n  times the ancient geological forests. The time is coming when our\r\n  text-books of botany and zoölogy will lose their local, limited\r\n  character, and present comprehensive pictures of Nature in all her\r\n  phases. Then only will it be possible to make true and pertinent\r\n  comparisons between the condition of the earth in former times and its\r\n  present aspect under different zones and climates. To this day the\r\n  fundamental principle guiding our identification of geological\r\n  formations in different ages rests upon the assumption that each\r\n  period has had one character throughout; whereas the progress of\r\n  geology is daily pressing upon us the evidence that at each period\r\n  different latitudes and different continents have always had their\r\n  characteristic animals and plants, if not as diversified as now, at\r\n  least varied enough to exclude the idea of uniformity. Not only do I\r\n  look for a vast improvement in our collections with improved methods\r\n  of travel and transportation in Brazil, but I hope that scientific\r\n  journeys in the tropics will cease to be occasional events in the\r\n  progress and civilization of nations, and will be as much within the\r\n  reach of every student as journeys in the temperate zone have hitherto\r\n  been. For further details respecting the building of this road, see\r\n  Appendix No. IV.—L. A.\r\n\r\nFootnote 19:\r\n\r\n  Among the frequent visitors at the laboratory, and one to whom Mr.\r\n  Agassiz was indebted for most efficient aid in making his collection\r\n  of fishes from the harbor of Rio, was our friend Dr. Pacheco de Silva,\r\n  who never lost an opportunity of paying us all sorts of friendly\r\n  attentions. He added quite a number of luxuries to the working-room\r\n  described above. Another friend who was often at the laboratory was\r\n  Dr. Nägeli. Notwithstanding his large practice, he found time to\r\n  assist Mr. Agassiz not only with collections but with drawings of\r\n  various specimens. Being himself an able naturalist, his co-operation\r\n  was very valuable. The collections were indeed enriched by\r\n  contributions from so many sources that it would be impossible to\r\n  enumerate them all here. In the more technical reports of the\r\n  expedition all such gifts are recorded, with the names of those\r\n  persons from whom the specimens were received.\r\n\r\nFootnote 20:\r\n\r\n  The palm is the beautiful _Oreodoxa oleracea_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 21:\r\n\r\n  Leuzinger’s admirable photographs of the scenery about the Corcovado,\r\n  as well as from Petropolis, the Organ Mountains, and the neighborhood\r\n  of Rio generally, may now be had in the print-shops of Boston and New\r\n  York. I am the more desirous to make this fact known as I am indebted\r\n  to Mr. Leuzinger for very generous assistance in the illustration of\r\n  scientific objects.—L. A.\r\n\r\nFootnote 22:\r\n\r\n  A commemorative tablet, set in the rocks on the dividing line between\r\n  the provinces of Rio de Janeiro and Minas Geräes, recording the speech\r\n  of the Emperor on the occasion of the opening of the road, testifies\r\n  the appreciation in which this undertaking was held by the government\r\n  of Brazil.\r\n\r\nFootnote 23:\r\n\r\n  Since this was written the Emperor, at a large pecuniary sacrifice,\r\n  has liberated all the slaves belonging to the property of the crown,\r\n  and a general scheme of emancipation has been announced by the\r\n  Brazilian government, the wisdom, foresight, and benevolence of which\r\n  can hardly be too highly praised. If this be adopted, slavery in\r\n  Brazil will disappear within the century by a gradual process,\r\n  involving no violent convulsion, and perilling neither the safety of\r\n  the slave nor the welfare of his master.\r\n\r\nFootnote 24:\r\n\r\n  To the Baron de Mauá, a leader in the great improvements now going on\r\n  in Brazil, the citizens of Rio de Janeiro owe their present convenient\r\n  road to Petropolis, their favorite summer residence.\r\n\r\nFootnote 25:\r\n\r\n  A species of Melastoma, with very large, conspicuous flowers.—L. A.\r\n\r\nFootnote 26:\r\n\r\n  This is not, however, native to Brazil.\r\n\r\nFootnote 27:\r\n\r\n  Indeed, their diversity is much greater even than that of our Oaks,\r\n  and it would require a comprehensive comparison with a majority of our\r\n  forest-trees to match the differences they exhibit among themselves;\r\n  and their native names, far more euphonic than the systematic names\r\n  under which they are entered in our scientific works, are as familiar\r\n  to the Indians as those of our beeches, birches, hazels, chestnuts,\r\n  poplars, or willows to our farmers. There are four essentially\r\n  different forms among the palms: the tall ones, with a slender and\r\n  erect stem, terminating with a crown of long feathery leaves, or with\r\n  broad fan-shaped leaves; the bushy ones, the leaves of which rise as\r\n  it were in tufts from the ground, the stem remaining hidden under the\r\n  foliage; the brush-like ones, with a small stem, and a few rather\r\n  large leaves; and the winding, creeping, slender species. Their\r\n  flowers and fruits are as varied as their stock. Some of these fruits\r\n  may be compared to large woody nuts, with a fleshy mass inside; others\r\n  have a scaly covering; others resemble peaches or apricots, while\r\n  others still are like plums or grapes. Most of them are eatable and\r\n  rather pleasant to the taste. It is a thousand pities that so many of\r\n  these majestic trees should have been deprived of their sonorous\r\n  native names, to bear henceforth, in the annals of science, the names\r\n  of some unknown princes, whom flattery alone could rescue from\r\n  oblivion. The Inaja has become a Maximiliana, the Jara a Leopoldinia,\r\n  the Pupunha a Guilielma, the Pachiuba an Iriartea, the Carana a\r\n  Mauritia. The changes from Indian to Greek names have not been more\r\n  felicitous. I would certainly have preferred Jacitara to Desmonchus,\r\n  Mucaja to Acrocomia, Baccába to Œnocarpus, Tucuma to Astrocaryum. Even\r\n  Euterpe for Assai is hardly an improvement.—L. A.\r\n\r\nFootnote 28:\r\n\r\n  This observation was confirmed by our year’s travel. The Brazilians\r\n  care little for a variety of vegetables, and do not give much\r\n  attention to their cultivation. Those they do use are chiefly imported\r\n  in cans from Europe.\r\n\r\nFootnote 29:\r\n\r\n  On our return from the Amazons a year later we heard with great regret\r\n  of the death of Mr. Taylor For many months he took an active part in\r\n  the objects of the Expedition, being himself a good naturalist, and\r\n  not only made valuable collections for Mr. Agassiz, but also some\r\n  admirable colored drawings of fishes and insects, which it is hoped\r\n  may be published at a future time with the other scientific results of\r\n  this journey.\r\n\r\nFootnote 30:\r\n\r\n  My experience of this day might well awaken the envy of any\r\n  naturalist, and I was myself no less astonished than grateful for its\r\n  scientific results. Not only had Senhor Lage provided us with the most\r\n  comfortable private conveyance, but he had sent messengers in advance\r\n  to all the planters residing near our line of travel, requesting them\r\n  to provide all the fishes that were to be had in the adjoining rivers\r\n  and brooks. The agents of the stations situated near water-courses had\r\n  also received instructions to have similar collections in readiness,\r\n  and in two places I found large tanks filled with living specimens of\r\n  all the species in the neighborhood. The small number of species\r\n  subsequently added, upon repeated excursions to different parts of the\r\n  basin of the Parahyba, convinced me that in this one day, thanks to\r\n  the kindness of our host and his friends, I had an opportunity of\r\n  examining nearly its whole ichthyological fauna, and of making\r\n  probably as complete a collection from it as may be found from any of\r\n  the considerable rivers of Europe in the larger museums of the Old\r\n  World.—L. A.\r\n\r\nFootnote 31:\r\n\r\n  In some maps this place is inscribed under the name of Parahybuna.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III.\r\n                  LIFE IN RIO CONTINUED.—FAZENDA LIFE.\r\n\r\n  BOTAFOGO.—INSANE HOSPITAL.—TIJUCA.—ERRATIC\r\n    DRIFT.—VEGETATION.—BIRTHDAY DINNER.—ARRANGEMENTS FOR PARTIES TO\r\n    THE INTERIOR.—PUBLIC LECTURES IN RIO.—PROCESSION OF ST.\r\n    GEORGE.—LEAVE RIO ON EXCURSION TO THE FORTALEZA DE SANTA\r\n    ANNA.—LOCALITIES FOR ERRATIC DRIFT BETWEEN RIO AND\r\n    PETROPOLIS.—DEPARTURE FROM JUIZ DE FORA.—ARRIVAL AT THE\r\n    FAZENDA.—RIDE IN THE FOREST.—EVE OF SAN JOAŌ.—CUPIM\r\n    NESTS.—EXCURSION TO THE UPPER FAZENDA.—GRAND HUNT.—PICNIC.—COFFEE\r\n    PLANTATION.—RETURN TO RIO.—MIMIC SNOW-FIELDS.—COFFEE INSECT\r\n    SPINNING ITS NEST.—VISIT TO THE FAZENDA OF COMMENDADOR\r\n    BREVES.—BOTANIZING EXCURSION TO TIJUCA.—PREPARATIONS FOR LEAVING\r\n    RIO.—MAJOR COUTINHO.—COLLEGIO DOM PEDRO SEGUNDO.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Botafogo Bay.]\r\n\r\n_May 22d._—This afternoon Dr. and Mrs. C—— and myself went out for a\r\ncountry ramble, somewhat at a venture, it is true, but feeling sure that\r\nin the beautiful scenery about Rio we could hardly go amiss. We took one\r\nof the many ferry-boats in the neighborhood of our hotel, and presently\r\nfound ourselves on the way to Botafogo. Almost all the environs of the\r\ncity are built along beaches; there is the beach or Praia of Botafogo,\r\nthe Praia of San Christovāo, the Praia of San Domingo, and half a dozen\r\nothers, all of which mean some suburb of the town situated on the shore\r\nwith a beach in front of it. As it is rather the fashion for the better\r\nclass of people to live out of town, the houses and gardens in these\r\nsuburbs are often delightful. We enjoyed the sail exceedingly. For a\r\npart of the way the boat keeps close under the mountains, and no\r\ndescription can give an idea of their picturesque outlines, or of the\r\nwonderful coloring which softens all their asperities and mellows the\r\nwhole landscape. We landed at a jetty thrown out from a romantic-looking\r\nroad, and as we found no carriage on the wharf, and ascertained that the\r\nboat did not return for two hours, we wandered up this road to see where\r\nchance would lead us. The afternoon would have been full of interest had\r\nit ended in the walk along the crescent-shaped bay, with the water\r\nrippling on the sands, and the mountains opposite all purple in the\r\nafternoon sunshine. The road brought us, however, to a magnificent\r\nhospital for the insane, the hospital of Dom Pedro Segundo, which we had\r\nseen and admired from the deck of the steamer on the day of our arrival.\r\nWe entered the grounds, and as the great door of the building was open\r\nand the official on guard looked by no means forbidding, we ascended the\r\nsteps and went in. It is difficult to imagine an edifice more\r\nappropriate for the purpose to which it is devoted. It is true we saw\r\nonly the public rooms and corridors, as a permit was required to enter\r\nthe wards; but a plan hanging near the entrance gave us an idea of the\r\narrangement of the building, and its general aspect bore testimony to\r\nthe cleanliness, cheerfulness, and order of the establishment. Some of\r\nthe public rooms were very handsome,—especially one, at the end of which\r\nstands a statue of the boy Emperor, taken, no doubt, at the time of his\r\ncoronation. In the man of forty you still recognize the frank,\r\nintelligent, manly face of the lad on whom such great responsibility was\r\nthrown at the age of fifteen. As we went up the spacious staircase, the\r\nsound of music brought us to the door of the chapel, where the evening\r\nservice was going on. Patients and nurses were kneeling together; a\r\nchoir of female voices was singing sweetly a calm, peaceful kind of\r\nmusic; that somewhat monotonous chanting, so passionless in its regular\r\nmovement, which one hears in the Catholic Church; the candles were\r\nburning before the altar, but the great window just outside the door was\r\nopen to the setting sun, and, as I stood in the balcony looking out on\r\nthe mountains and listening to the music, I thought that a mind which\r\nhad gone astray might find its way back again in such scenes and under\r\nsuch influences. Certainly, if nature has any healing power, it must be\r\nfelt here. We lingered and listened as long as we dared, and stole away\r\nas the services were closing, just in time to take the evening boat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mina Negress.]\r\n\r\n_May 25th._—The fish-market is, in all seaport towns, a favorite haunt\r\nwith Mr. Agassiz, and here it has an especial interest for him on\r\naccount of the variety and beauty of the fishes brought in every\r\nmorning. I sometimes accompany him in these rambles for the pleasure of\r\nseeing the fresh loads of oranges, flowers, and vegetables, and of\r\nwatching the picturesque negro groups selling their wares or sitting\r\nabout in knots to gossip. We have already learned that the fine-looking\r\nathletic negroes of a nobler type, at least physically, than any we see\r\nin the States, are the so-called Mina negroes, from the province of\r\nMina, in Western Africa. They are a very powerful-looking race, and the\r\nwomen especially are finely made and have quite a dignified presence. I\r\nam never tired of watching them in the street and market, where they are\r\nto be seen in numbers, being more commonly employed as venders of fruit\r\nand vegetables than as house-servants. It is said that a certain wild\r\nand independent element in their character makes them unfit for domestic\r\nservice. The women always wear a high muslin turban, and a long,\r\nbright-colored shawl, either crossed on the breast and thrown carelessly\r\nover the shoulder, or, if the day be chilly, drawn closely around them,\r\ntheir arms hidden in its folds. The amount of expression they throw into\r\nthe use of this shawl is quite amazing. I watched a tall, superbly made\r\nwoman in the street to-day who was in a great passion. Gesticulating\r\nviolently, she flung her shawl wide, throwing out both arms, then,\r\ndrawing it suddenly in, folded it about her, and stretched herself to\r\nher full height; presently opening it once more, she shook her fist in\r\nthe face of her opponent, and then, casting one end of her long drapery\r\nover her shoulder, stalked away with the air of a tragedy queen. It\r\nserves as a cradle also, for, tying it loosely round their hips, they\r\nslip the baby into the folds behind, and there it hangs, rocked to sleep\r\nby the mother’s movement as she walks on with her long, swinging tread.\r\nThe Mina negress is almost invariably remarkable for her beautiful hand\r\nand arm. She seems to be conscious of this, and usually wears\r\nclose-fitting bracelets at the wrist, made of some bright-colored beads,\r\nwhich set off the form of the hand and are exceedingly becoming on her\r\ndark, shining skin. These negroes are Mohammedans, and are said to\r\nremain faithful to their prophet, though surrounded by the observances\r\nof the Catholic Church. They do not seem to me so affable and responsive\r\nas the Congo negroes, but are, on the contrary, rather haughty. One\r\nmorning I came upon a cluster of them in the market breakfasting after\r\ntheir work was done, and I stopped to talk with them, asking what they\r\nhad for breakfast, and trying various subjects on which to open an\r\nacquaintance. But they looked at me coldly and suspiciously, barely\r\nanswering my questions, and were evidently relieved when I walked away.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mina Negress and Child.]\r\n\r\n_May 26th._—Tijuca. In the pleasant environs of Rio there is no resort\r\nmore frequented than the establishment of Mr. Bennett at Tijuca, and we\r\nwere not sorry the day before yesterday to leave the hot, dusty city,\r\nwith a pleasant party of friends, for this cluster of mountains, some\r\neighteen hundred feet above the sea level and about eight miles from\r\nRio. It takes its name from the peak of Tijuca, so conspicuous an object\r\nin the coast range. On our arrival we were very cordially welcomed by\r\nour host himself, who was not quite a stranger to us, for Mr. Agassiz\r\nhas been already indebted to him for valuable collections. Mr. Bennett\r\nhas an Englishman’s love of nature, and is very familiar with the botany\r\nand zoölogy of the beautiful region which has been his home for many\r\nyears. Under his guidance, we have taken a number of pleasant rambles\r\nand rides, regretting only that we cannot avail ourselves for a longer\r\ntime of his intimate knowledge of the locality and its productions.\r\n\r\nI have alluded before to the perplexing character of the geology, and\r\nthe almost universal decomposition of the rock surfaces, making it\r\ndifficult to decipher them. The presence of the drift phenomena, so\r\nuniversal in the Northern hemisphere, has been denied here; but, in his\r\nlong walk to-day, Mr. Agassiz has had an opportunity of observing a\r\ngreat number of erratic boulders, having no connection with the rocks in\r\nplace, and also a sheet of drift studded with boulders and resting above\r\nthe partially stratified metamorphic rock in immediate contact with it.\r\nI introduce here a letter written by him to his friend, Professor Peirce\r\nof Harvard University, under the first impression of the day’s\r\nexperience, which will best explain his view of the subject.\r\n\r\n                                              “May 27th, 1865, TIJUCA.\r\n\r\n  “MY DEAR PEIRCE:—\r\n\r\n  “Yesterday was one of the happiest days of my life, and I want to\r\n  share it with you. Here I am at Tijuca, a cluster of hills, about\r\n  eighteen hundred feet high and some seven or eight miles from Rio,\r\n  in a charming cottage-like hotel, from the terrace of which you see\r\n  a drift hill with innumerable erratic boulders, as characteristic as\r\n  any I have ever seen in New England. I had before seen sundry\r\n  unmistakable traces of drift, but there was everywhere connected\r\n  with the drift itself such an amount of decomposed rocks of various\r\n  kinds, that, though I could see the drift and distinguish it from\r\n  the decomposed primary rocks in place, on account of my familiarity\r\n  with that kind of deposits, yet I could probably never have\r\n  satisfied anybody else that there is here an equivalent of the\r\n  Northern drift, had I not found yesterday, near Bennett’s hotel at\r\n  Tijuca, the most palpable superposition of drift and decomposed\r\n  rocks, with a distinct line of demarcation between the two, of which\r\n  I shall secure a good photograph. This locality afforded me at once\r\n  an opportunity of contrasting the decomposed rocks which form a\r\n  characteristic feature of the whole country (as far as I have yet\r\n  seen it) with the superincumbent drift, and of making myself\r\n  familiar with the peculiarities of both deposits; so that I trust I\r\n  shall be able hereafter to distinguish both, whether they are in\r\n  contact with one another or found separately. These decomposed rocks\r\n  are quite a new feature to me in the structure of the country.\r\n  Imagine granite, gneiss, mica slate, clay slate, and in fact all the\r\n  various kinds of rocks usually found in old metamorphic formations,\r\n  reduced to the condition of a soft paste, exhibiting all the\r\n  mineralogical elements of the rocks, as they may have been before\r\n  they were decomposed, but now completely disintegrated and resting\r\n  side by side, as if they had been accumulated artificially in the\r\n  manner you have seen glass cylinders filled with variously colored\r\n  sands or clays to imitate the appearance of the beds of Gay-Head.\r\n  And through this loose mass there run, here and there, larger or\r\n  smaller dikes of quartz-rock or of granite or other rocks equally\r\n  disintegrated; but they retain the arrangement of their materials,\r\n  showing them to be disintegrated dikes in large disintegrated masses\r\n  of rock; the whole passing unmistakably to rocks of the same kind in\r\n  which the decomposition or disintegration is only partial, or no\r\n  trace of it visible, and the whole mass exhibiting then the\r\n  appearance of an ordinary metamorphic set of rocks.\r\n\r\n  “That such masses forming everywhere the surface of the country\r\n  should be a great obstacle to the study of the erratic phenomena is\r\n  at once plain, and I do not therefore wonder that those who seem\r\n  familiar with the country should now entertain the idea that the\r\n  surface rocks are everywhere decomposed, and that there is no\r\n  erratic formation or drift here. But upon close examination it is\r\n  easy to perceive that, while the decomposed rocks consist of small\r\n  particles of the primitive rocks which they represent, with their\r\n  dikes and all other characteristic features, there is not a trace of\r\n  larger or smaller boulders in them; while the superincumbent drift,\r\n  consisting of a similar paste, does not show the slightest sign of\r\n  the indistinct stratification characteristic of the decomposed\r\n  metamorphic rocks below it, nor any of the decomposed dikes, but is\r\n  full of various kinds of boulders of various dimensions. I have not\r\n  yet traced the boulders to their origin; but the majority consist of\r\n  a kind of greenstone composed of equal amounts of a greenish black\r\n  hornblende and feldspar. In Entre Rios on the Parahyba, I was told\r\n  by an engineer on the road that in Minas Geräes iron mines are\r\n  worked in a rock like these boulders. This week I propose to explore\r\n  the Serra da Mantiqueira,[32] which separates the province of Rio\r\n  from Minas, and may advance the question further. But you see that I\r\n  need not go to the Andes to find erratics, though it may yet be\r\n  necessary for me to go, in order to trace the evidence of glacier\r\n  action in the accumulation of this drift; for you will notice that I\r\n  have only given you the evidence of extensive accumulations of drift\r\n  similar in its characteristics to Northern drift. But I have not yet\r\n  seen a trace of glacial action properly speaking, if polished\r\n  surfaces and scratches and furrows are especially to be considered\r\n  as such.\r\n\r\n  “The decomposition of the surface rocks to the extent to which it\r\n  takes place here is very remarkable, and points to a new geological\r\n  agency, thus far not discussed in our geological theories. It is\r\n  obvious here (and to-day with the pouring rain which keeps me in\r\n  doors I have satisfactory evidence of it) that the warm rains\r\n  falling upon the heated soil must have a very powerful action in\r\n  accelerating the decomposition of rocks. It is like torrents of hot\r\n  water falling for ages in succession upon hot stones. Think of the\r\n  effect, and, instead of wondering at the large amount of decomposed\r\n  rocks which you meet everywhere, you will be surprised that there\r\n  are any rocks left in their primitive condition. It is, however, the\r\n  fact, that all the rocks you see are encased, as it were, in a\r\n  lining of the decomposed part of their surface; they are actually\r\n  covered with a rotten crust of their own substance.\r\n\r\n                                         “Ever truly yours,\r\n\r\n                                                         “L. AGASSIZ.”\r\n\r\nAmong the objects of special interest which we have seen here for the\r\nfirst time are the colossal fruits of the Sapucaia-tree, a species of\r\nLecythis, belonging to the same family as the Brazilian nuts. These\r\nfruits, of which there are a number of species, vary from the size of an\r\napple to that of an ordinary melon; they resemble an urn closed with a\r\nlid, and contain about fifty seeds as large as almonds. The woods all\r\nover these Tijuca hills are beautiful and wonderfully luxuriant; but I\r\nlack names for the various trees. We are not yet familiar enough with\r\nthe aspect of the forest to distinguish readily its different forms of\r\nvegetation; and it is besides exceedingly difficult here to ascertain\r\nthe common names of plants. The Brazilians do not seem to me observant\r\nof nature in its details; at all events, I never get a satisfactory\r\nanswer to the question I am constantly putting, “What do you call this\r\ntree or flower?” And if you ask a botanist, he invariably gives you the\r\nscientific, not the popular name, nor does he seem to be aware that any\r\nsuch exists. I have a due respect for nomenclature, but when I inquire\r\nthe name of some very graceful tree or some exquisite flower, I like to\r\nreceive a manageable answer, something that may fitly be introduced into\r\nthe privacy of domestic life, rather than the ponderous official Latin\r\nappellation. We are struck with the variety of Melastomas in full flower\r\nnow, and very conspicuous, from their large purple blossoms, and have\r\nremarked also several species of the Bombaceæ, easily distinguished by\r\ntheir peculiar foliage and large cotton fruits. The Candelabra-tree\r\n(Cecropia) is abundant here, as throughout the neighborhood of Rio, and\r\nis covered at this season with fruit resembling somewhat the fruit of\r\nthe bread-tree, but more slender and cylindrical in form. Large\r\nEuphorbias, of the size of forest-trees, also attract our attention, for\r\nit is the first time we have seen them except as shrubs, such as the\r\n“Estrella do Norte” (Poinsettia). But there is before Mr. Bennett’s\r\nhouse a very large nut-tree, “Nogueira,” of this family. The palms are\r\nnumerous; among them the Astrocaryum Cari, whose spiny stems and leaves\r\nmake it difficult to approach, is very common. Its bunches of bright\r\nchestnut-brown fruit hang from between the leaves which form its crown,\r\neach bunch about a foot in length, massive and compact, like a large\r\ncluster of black Hamburg grapes. The Syagrus palm is also frequent; it\r\nhas a greenish fruit not unlike the olive in appearance, also hanging in\r\nlarge pendent bunches just below the leaves. The mass of foliage is\r\neverywhere knit together by parasitic vines without number, and every\r\ndead branch or fallen trunk is overgrown by parasites. Foreign tropical\r\ntrees are cultivated about the houses everywhere,—bread-fruit trees and\r\nAmeixas, a kind of plum of the hawthorn family, bananas, etc. The bamboo\r\nof the East Indies also is used to form avenues in Rio de Janeiro and\r\nits environs. The alleys of bamboo in the grounds of the palace at San\r\nChristovāo are among its most beautiful ornaments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fallen Trunk overgrown by Parasites.]\r\n\r\nMr. Agassiz has been surprised to find that shrimps of considerable size\r\nare common in all the brooks and even in the highest pools of Tijuca. It\r\nseems strange to meet with Crustacea of marine forms in mountain\r\nstreams.\r\n\r\nTo-day we are kept in the house by a violent rain, but there is enough\r\nto do in looking over specimens, working up journals, writing letters,\r\n&c., to prevent the time from hanging heavy on our hands. To-morrow we\r\nreturn to town.\r\n\r\n_May 28th_, RIO.—To-day is Mr. Agassiz’s birthday, and it has been so\r\naffectionately remembered here that it is difficult to believe ourselves\r\nin a foreign country. The Swiss citizens gave him a dinner yesterday on\r\nthe eve of the anniversary, where everything recalled the land of his\r\nbirth, without excluding the land of his adoption. The room was draped\r\nwith the flags of all the Cantons, while the ceiling was covered by two\r\nSwiss national flags, united in the centre just above his own seat by\r\nthe American flag, thus recognizing at once his Swiss nationality and\r\nhis American citizenship.[33] The Brazilian flag which gave them all\r\nhospitality and protection had also an honored place. The fête is\r\nreported to have been most genial and gay, closing with a number of\r\nstudent songs in which all bore their share, and succeeded by a serenade\r\nunder our windows. To-day our room is festive with flowers and other\r\ndecorations, and friendly greetings on every side remind us that, though\r\nin a foreign land, we are not among strangers.\r\n\r\n_June 14th._—Since our return from Tijuca we have been almost constantly\r\nin town, Mr. Agassiz being engaged, often from early morning till deep\r\ninto the night, in taking care of the specimens which come in from every\r\nquarter, and making the final preparations for the parties which he\r\nintends sending into the interior. The most important of these, or\r\nrather the one for which it is most difficult to procure the necessary\r\nfacilities, is bound for the upper course of the San Francisco. At this\r\npoint one or more of their number will strike across the country to the\r\nTocantins, and descend that river to the Amazons, while the others will\r\nfollow the valley of the Piauhy to the coast. This is a long, difficult,\r\nbut, as we are assured, not a dangerous journey for young and vigorous\r\nmen. But wishing to anticipate every trouble that may befall them, Mr.\r\nAgassiz has made it his business to ascertain, as far as possible, the\r\nnature of the route, and to obtain letters to the most influential\r\npeople for every step of the road. This has been no light task; in a\r\ncountry where there are no established means of internal communication,\r\nwhere mules, guides, camaradas, and even an armed escort may be\r\nnecessary, and must be provided for in advance, the preparation for a\r\njourney through the interior requires a vast deal of forethought. Add to\r\nthis the national habit of procrastination, the profound conviction of\r\nthe Brazilian that to-morrow is better than to-day, and one may\r\nunderstand how it happens that, although it has been a primary object\r\nsince our arrival to expedite the party to the Tocantins, their\r\ndeparture has been delayed till now. And yet it would be the height of\r\ningratitude to give the impression that there has been any backwardness\r\non the part of the Brazilians themselves, or of their government, to\r\nfacilitate the objects of the expedition. On the contrary, they not only\r\nshow a warm interest, but the utmost generosity, and readiness to give\r\nall the practical aid in their power. Several leading members of the\r\nCabinet, the Senate, and the House of Representatives have found time\r\nnow, when they have a war upon their hands, and when one ministry has\r\nbeen going out and another coming in, not only to prepare the necessary\r\nintroductions for these parties from Rio to the Amazons, but also to\r\nwrite out the routes, giving the most important directions and\r\ninformation for the separate journeys.[34] Yet with the best will in the\r\nworld the Brazilians know comparatively little of the interior of their\r\nown country. It is necessary to collect all that is known from a variety\r\nof sources, and then to combine it as well as may be, so as to form an\r\norganized plan. Even then a great deal must be left to be decided in\r\naccordance with circumstances which no one can foresee. No pains have\r\nbeen spared to anticipate all the probable difficulties, and to provide\r\nfor them as far as it is humanly possible to do so; and we feel that\r\nthis journey, a part of which has been made by very few persons before,\r\nhas never been undertaken under better auspices. This party will explore\r\nthe upper course of the Rio Doce, the Rio das Velhas, and the San\r\nFrancisco, with the lower course of the Tocantins and its tributaries,\r\nas far as they can; making also collections of fossils in certain\r\nregions upon the route. Another party, starting at about the same time,\r\nis to keep nearer the coast, exploring the lower course of the Rio Doce\r\nand the San Francisco. Mr. Agassiz thus hopes to make at least a partial\r\nsurvey of this great water system, while he himself undertakes the\r\nAmazons and its tributaries.[35] In the mean time, the result of the\r\nweeks he has been obliged to spend in Rio, while organizing the work of\r\nthese parties and making the practical arrangements for its prosecution,\r\nhas been very satisfactory. The collections are large, and will give a\r\ntolerably complete idea of the fauna of this province, as well as a part\r\nof that of Minas Geräes. A survey of the Dom Pedro Railroad, made under\r\nhis direction by his two young friends, Messrs. Hart and St. John, is\r\nalso an excellent beginning of the work in this department, and his own\r\nobservations on the drift phenomena have an important bearing on the\r\ngreat questions on which he hoped to throw new light in coming here. The\r\nclosing words of a lecture delivered by him last evening at the Collegio\r\nDom Pedro Segundo will best express his own estimation of the facts he\r\nhas collected in their bearing on the drift phenomena in other parts of\r\nthe world. After giving some account of the erratic blocks and drift\r\nobserved by him at Tijuca and already described in his letter to Mr.\r\nPeirce, he added: “I wish here to make a nice distinction that I may not\r\nbe misunderstood. I _affirm_ that the erratic phenomena, viz. erratic\r\ndrift, in immediate superposition with partially decomposed stratified\r\nrock, exist here in your immediate neighborhood; I _believe_ that these\r\nphenomena are connected, here as elsewhere, with the action of ice. It\r\nis nevertheless possible that a more intimate study of these subjects in\r\ntropical regions may reveal some phase of the phenomena not hitherto\r\nobserved, just as the investigation of the glacial action in the United\r\nStates has shown that immense masses of ice may move over a plain, as\r\nwell as over a mountain slope. Let me now urge a special study of these\r\nfacts upon the young geologists of Rio, as they have never been\r\ninvestigated and their presence is usually denied. If you ask me, ‘To\r\nwhat end?—of what use is such a discovery?’—I answer, It is given to no\r\nmortal man to predict what may be the result of any discovery in the\r\nrealms of nature. When the electric current was discovered, what was it?\r\nA curiosity. When the first electric machine was invented, to what use\r\nwas it put? To make puppets dance for the amusement of children. To-day\r\nit is the most powerful engine of civilization. But should our work have\r\nno other result than this,—to know that certain facts in nature are thus\r\nand not otherwise, that their causes were such and no others,—this\r\nresult in itself is good enough, and great enough, since the end of man,\r\nhis aim, his glory, is the knowledge of the truth.”\r\n\r\nOne word upon these lectures, since we are told by the Brazilians\r\nthemselves that the introduction of public lectures among them is a\r\nnovelty and in a certain sense an era in their educational history. If\r\nany subject of science or letters is to be presented to the public here,\r\nit is done under special conditions before a selected audience, where\r\nthe paper is read in presence of the Emperor with all due solemnity.\r\nPopular instruction, with admittance for all who care to listen or to\r\nlearn, has been hitherto a thing unknown. The suggestion was made by Dr.\r\nPacheco, the Director of the Collegio Dom Pedro II., a man of liberal\r\nculture and great intelligence, who has already done much for the\r\nprogress of education in Rio de Janeiro; it found favor with the\r\nEmperor, who is keenly alive to anything which can stimulate the love of\r\nknowledge among his people, and at his request Mr. Agassiz has given a\r\ncourse of lectures in French on a variety of scientific subjects. He was\r\nindeed very glad to have an opportunity of introducing here a means of\r\npopular education which he believes to have been very salutary in its\r\ninfluence among us. At first the presence of ladies was objected to, as\r\ntoo great an innovation on national habits; but even that was overcome,\r\nand the doors were opened to all comers, the lectures being given after\r\nthe true New England fashion. I must say that, if the absolutely\r\nuninterrupted attention of an audience is any test of its intelligence,\r\nno man could ask a better one than that which Mr. Agassiz has had the\r\npleasure of addressing in Rio de Janeiro. It has also been a great\r\npleasure to him, after teaching for nearly twenty years in English, to\r\nthrow off the fetters of a foreign tongue and speak again in French.\r\nAfter all, with a few exceptions, a man’s native language remains for\r\nhim the best; it is the element in which he always moves most at ease.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor, with his family, has been present at all these lectures,\r\nand it is worthy of note, as showing the simplicity of his character,\r\nthat, instead of occupying the raised platform intended for them, he\r\ncaused the chairs to be placed on a level with the others, as if to show\r\nthat in science at least there is no distinction of rank.[36]\r\n\r\n_June 11th._—To-day has been a festa, but one the significance of which\r\nit is somewhat difficult to understand, so singularly is the religious\r\nelement mingled with the grotesque and quaint. In the Church it is the\r\nfeast of Corpus Christi, but it happens to fall on the same date as\r\nanother festival in honor of St. George, which is kept with all sorts of\r\nantique ceremonies. I went in the morning with our young friend, Mr.\r\nT——, to the Imperial chapel, where high mass was celebrated, and at the\r\nclose of the services we had some difficulty in finding our way back to\r\nthe hotel, before which the procession was to pass, for the street was\r\nalready draped with all sorts of gay colors and crowded with spectators.\r\nFirst in order came the religious part of the procession; a long array\r\nof priests and church officials carrying lighted candles, pyramids of\r\nflowers, banners, &c. Then came the host, under a canopy of white satin\r\nand gold, supported by massive staffs; the bearers were the highest\r\ndignitaries of the land, first among them being the Emperor himself and\r\nhis son-in-law, the Duke of Saxe. In strange contrast with these\r\nsolemnities was the stuffed equestrian figure of St. George, a huge,\r\nunwieldy shape on horseback, preceded and followed by riders almost as\r\ngrotesque as himself. With him came a number of orders resembling, if\r\nnot the same as, the Free-Masons, the Odd Fellows, and like societies.\r\nThe better educated Brazilians speak of this procession as an old legacy\r\nfrom Portugal, which has lost its significance for them, and which they\r\nwould gladly see pass out of use, as it is already out of date.\r\n\r\nThis evening Mr. Agassiz gave the closing lecture of his course. It is\r\nto be followed next week by a lecture from Dr. Capanema, the Brazilian\r\ngeologist, and there will be an attempt made to organize courses of\r\npublic lectures on the same plan hereafter. Our numbers are gradually\r\ndiminishing. Last week the party for the interior, consisting of Messrs.\r\nSt. John, Allen, Ward, and Sceva, started, and Messrs. Hartt and\r\nCopeland leave in a day or two to undertake an exploration of the coast\r\nbetween the Parahyba do Sul and Bahia.\r\n\r\n_June 30th._—On the 21st we left Rio on our way to the province of Minas\r\nGeräes, where we were to pass a week at the coffee fazenda of Senhor\r\nLage, who received us so courteously on our former visit to Juiz de\r\nFora, and who was so influential in projecting and carrying out the\r\nUnion and Industry road. The journey to Juiz de Fora, though we had made\r\nit once before, had lost nothing of its beauty by familiarity, and had\r\ngained in interest of another kind; for his examination of the erratic\r\ndrift at Tijuca has given Mr. Agassiz the key to the geological\r\nconstitution of the soil, and what seemed to him quite inexplicable on\r\nour first excursion over this road is now perfectly legible. It is\r\ninteresting to watch the progress of an investigation of this character,\r\nand to see how the mental process gradually clears away the obscurity.\r\nThe perception becomes sharpened by dwelling upon the subject, and the\r\nmind adapts itself to a difficult problem as the eye adapts itself to\r\ndarkness. That which was confused at first presently becomes clear to\r\nthe mental vision of the observer, who watches and waits for the light\r\nto enter. There is one effect of the atmospheric influence here, already\r\nalluded to in the previous pages, which at first sight is very\r\ndeceptive. Wherever there is any cut through drift, unless recently\r\nopened, it becomes baked at the surface so as to simulate stone in such\r\na way as hardly to be distinguished from the decomposed rock surfaces in\r\nplace, unless by a careful examination. This, together with the partial\r\nobliteration of the stratification in many places, makes it, at first\r\nglance, difficult to recognize the point of contact between the\r\nstratified rock and the drift resting above it. A little familiarity\r\nwith these deceptive appearances, however, makes it as easy to read the\r\nbroken leaves of the book of nature here as elsewhere, and Mr. Agassiz\r\nhas now no more difficulty in following the erratic phenomena in these\r\nSouthern regions than in the Northern hemisphere. All that is wanting to\r\ncomplete the evidence of the actual presence of ice here, in former\r\ntimes, is the glacial writing, the striæ and furrows and polish which\r\nmark its track in the temperate zone. These one can hardly hope to find\r\nwhere the rock is of so perishable a character and its disintegration so\r\nrapid. But this much is certain,—a sheet of drift covers the country,\r\ncomposed of a homogeneous paste without trace of stratification,\r\ncontaining loose materials of all sorts and sizes, imbedded in it\r\nwithout reference to weight, large boulders, smaller stones, pebbles,\r\nand the like. This drift is very unevenly distributed; sometimes rising\r\ninto high hills, owing to the surrounding denudations; sometimes\r\ncovering the surface merely as a thin layer; sometimes, and especially\r\non steep slopes, washed completely away, leaving the bare face of the\r\nrock; sometimes deeply gullied, so as to produce a succession of\r\ndepressions and elevations alternating with each other. To this latter\r\ncause is due, in great degree, the billowy, undulating character of the\r\nvalleys. Another cause of difficulty in tracing the erratic phenomena\r\nconsists in the number of detached fragments which have fallen from the\r\nneighboring heights. It is not always easy to distinguish these from the\r\nerratic boulders. But a number of localities exist, nevertheless, where\r\nthe drift rests immediately above stratified rock, with the boulders\r\nprotruding from it, the line of contact being perfectly distinct. It is\r\na curious fact, that one may follow the drift everywhere in this region\r\nby the prosperous coffee plantations. Here as elsewhere ice has been the\r\ngreat fertilizer,—a gigantic plough grinding the rocks to powder and\r\nmaking a homogeneous soil in which the greatest variety of chemical\r\nelements are brought together from distant localities. So far as we have\r\nfollowed these phenomena in the provinces of Rio and Minas Geräes, the\r\nthriving coffee plantations are upon erratic drift, the poorer growth\r\nupon decomposed rock in place. Upon remarking this, we were told that\r\nthe farmers who are familiar with the soil select that in which they\r\nfind loose rocks imbedded, because it is the most fertile. They\r\nunconsciously seek the erratic drift. It may not be amiss to point out\r\nsome of the localities in which these geological phenomena may be most\r\nreadily studied, since they lie along the public road, and are easy of\r\naccess. The drift is very evident in the swamp between Mauá and Raiz da\r\nSerra on the way to Petropolis. In ascending the Serra at the half-way\r\nhouse there is an excellent locality for observing drift and boulders;\r\nand beyond one may follow the drift up to the very top of the road. The\r\nwhole tract between Villa Theresa and Petropolis is full of drift. Just\r\noutside of Petropolis, the Piabanha has excavated its bed in drift,\r\nwhile the banks have been ravined by the rains. At the station of\r\nCorreio, in front of the building, is also an admirable opportunity for\r\nobserving all the erratic phenomena, for here the drift, with large\r\nboulders interspersed throughout the mass, overlies the rock in place. A\r\nfew steps to the north of the station Pedro do Rio there is another\r\ngreat accumulation of large boulders in drift. These are but a few of\r\nthe localities where such facts may be observed.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the 22d we arrived at Juiz de Fora, and started at\r\nsunrise the next morning for the fazenda of Senhor Lage, some thirty\r\nmiles beyond. We had a gay party, consisting of the family of Senhor\r\nLage and that of his brother-in-law, Senhor Machado, with one or two\r\nother friends and ourselves. The children were as merry as possible, for\r\na visit to the fazenda was a rarity, and looked upon by them as a great\r\nfestivity. To transport us all with our luggage, two large coaches were\r\nprovided, several mules, and a small carriage, while a travelling\r\nphotographic machine, belonging to Senhor Machado, who is an admirable\r\nphotographist, brought up the rear.[37] The day was beautiful and our\r\nroad lay along the side of the Serra, commanding fine views of the\r\ninland country and the coffee plantations which covered the hillsides\r\nwherever the primeval forest had been cut down. The road is another\r\nevidence of the intelligence and energy of the proprietor. The old roads\r\nare mere mule tracks up one side of the Serra and down the other,\r\ngullied of course by all the heavy rains and rendered at times almost\r\nimpassable. Senhor Lage has shown his neighbors what may be done for\r\ntheir comfort in a country life by abandoning the old method, and,\r\ninstead of carrying the road across the mountain, cutting it in the side\r\nwith so gradual an ascent as to make the ride a very easy one. It is but\r\na four hours’ drive now from Juiz de Fora to the fazenda, whereas, until\r\nthe last year, it was a day’s, or even in bad weather a two days’\r\njourney on horseback. It is much to be desired that his example should\r\nbe followed, for the absence of any tolerable roads in the country makes\r\ntravelling in the interior almost an impossibility, and is the most\r\nserious obstacle to the general progress and prosperity. It seems\r\nstrange that the governments of the different provinces, at least of the\r\nmore populous ones, such as Minas Geräes and Rio, should not organize a\r\nsystem of good highways for the greater facility of commerce. The\r\npresent mode of transportation on mule back is slow and cumbrous in the\r\nhighest degree; it would seem as if, where the produce of the interior\r\nis so valuable, good roads would pay for themselves very soon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fazenda de Santa Anna in Minas Geraës.]\r\n\r\nAt about eleven o’clock we arrived at the “Fazenda,” the long, low,\r\nwhite buildings of which enclosed an oblong, open space divided into\r\nlarge squares, where the coffee was drying. Only a part of this\r\nextensive building is occupied as the living rooms of the family; the\r\nrest is devoted to all sorts of objects connected with the care of the\r\ncoffee, provision for the negroes, and the like.\r\n\r\nWhen we reached the plantation the guests had not all arrived. The\r\nspecial occasion of this excursion to the fazenda was the festival of\r\nSan João, kept always with great ceremonies in the country; the whole\r\nweek was to be devoted to hunting, and Senhor Lage had invited all the\r\nbest sportsmen in the neighborhood to join in the chase. It will be seen\r\nin the end that these hunters formed themselves into a most valuable\r\ncorps of collectors for Mr. Agassiz. After an excellent breakfast we\r\nstarted on horseback for the forest with such of the company as had\r\nalready assembled. The ride through the dense, deep, quiet wood was\r\nbeautiful; and the dead pause when some one thought the game was near,\r\nthe hushed voices, the breathless waiting for the shot which announced\r\nsuccess or failure, only added a charm to the scene. They have a strange\r\nway of hunting here; as the forest is perfectly impenetrable, they\r\nscatter food in a cleared space for the animals, and build green\r\nscreens, leaving holes to look through; behind such a screen the hunter\r\nwaits and watches for hours perhaps, till the paca, or peccary, or\r\ncapivara steals out to feed. The ladies dismounted and found a cool seat\r\nin one of these forest lodges, where they waited for the hunt. No great\r\nsuccess, after all, this afternoon, but some birds which were valuable\r\nas specimens. We rode home in the evening to a late dinner, after which\r\nan enormous bonfire, built by the negroes in honor of the Eve of St.\r\nJoão, was lighted in front of the house. The scene was exceedingly\r\npicturesque, the whole establishment, the neighboring negro huts, and\r\nthe distant forest being illuminated by the blaze, around which the\r\nblacks were dancing, accompanying their wild gestures with song and\r\ndrum. Every now and then a burst of fireworks added new brightness to\r\nthe picture.\r\n\r\nThe next day, the 24th, began with a long ride on horseback before\r\nbreakfast, after which I accompanied Mr. Agassiz on a sort of\r\nexploration among the Cupim nests (the nests of the Termites). These are\r\nmounds sometimes three or four or even six feet high, and from two to\r\nthree or four feet in diameter, of an extraordinary solidity, almost as\r\nhard as rock. Senhor Lage sent with us several negroes carrying axes to\r\nsplit them open, which, with all their strength, proved no easy task.\r\nThese nests appear usually to have been built around some old trunk or\r\nroot as a foundation; the interior, with its endless serpentine\r\npassages, looked not unlike the convolutions of a meandrina or brain\r\ncoral; the walls of the passages seemed to be built of earth that had\r\nbeen chewed or kneaded in some way, giving them somewhat the consistency\r\nof paper. The interior was quite soft and brittle, so that as soon as\r\nthe negroes could break through the outer envelope, about six inches in\r\nthickness, the whole structure readily fell to pieces. It had no opening\r\noutside, but we found, on uprooting one of these edifices from the\r\nbottom, that the whole base was perforated with holes leading into the\r\nground beneath. The interior of all of them swarmed with the different\r\nkinds of inhabitants; the little white ones, the larger black ones with\r\nbrown heads and powerful forceps, and in each were found one or two very\r\nlarge swollen white ones, quite different in dimensions and appearance\r\nfrom the rest, probably the queens. With the assistance of the negroes,\r\nMr. Agassiz made, for future examination, a large collection of all the\r\ndifferent kinds of individuals thus living together in various numeric\r\nproportions, and he would gladly have carried away one of the nests, but\r\nthey are too cumbersome for transportation. The Cupim nests are very\r\ndifferent from the dwellings of the Sauba ants, which have large\r\nexternal openings. The latter make houses by excavating, and sometimes\r\nundermine a hill so extensively, with their long galleries, that when a\r\nfire is lighted at one of the entrances to exterminate them, the smoke\r\nissues at numerous openings, distant perhaps a quarter of a mile from\r\neach other, showing in how many directions they have tunnelled out the\r\nhill, and that their winding passages communicate with each other\r\nthroughout. So many travellers have given accounts of these ant-houses,\r\nand of the activity of their inhabitants in stripping and carrying off\r\nthe leaves of trees to deposit them in their habitations, that it hardly\r\nseems worth while to repeat the story. Yet no one can see without\r\nastonishment one of these ant-armies travelling along the road they have\r\nworn so neatly for themselves, those who are coming from the trees\r\nlooking like a green procession, almost hidden by the fragments of\r\nleaves they carry on their backs, while the returning troops, who have\r\nalready deposited their burden, are hurrying back for more. There seems\r\nto be another set of individuals running to and fro, whose office is not\r\nquite so clear, unless it be to marshal the whole swarm and act as a\r\nkind of police. This view is confirmed by an anecdote related by an\r\nAmerican resident here, who told us that he once saw an ant, returning\r\nwithout his load to the house, stopped by one of these anomalous\r\nindividuals, severely chastised and sent back to the tree apparently to\r\ndo his appointed task. The Sauba ants are very injurious to the coffee\r\nshrubs, and difficult to exterminate.[38]\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon, the hunters of the neighborhood began to come in and\r\nthe party was considerably enlarged. This fazenda life, at least on an\r\ninformal jovial occasion like this, has a fascinating touch of the\r\nMiddle Ages in it. I am always reminded of this when we assemble for\r\ndinner in the large dimly lighted hall, where a long table, laden with\r\ngame and with large haunches of meat, stands ready for the miscellaneous\r\ncompany, daily growing in numbers. At the upper end sit the family with\r\ntheir immediate guests; below, with his family, is the “Administrador,”\r\nwhose office I suppose corresponds to that of overseer on a Southern\r\nplantation. In this instance he is a large picturesque-looking man,\r\ngenerally equipped in a kind of gray blouse strapped around the waist by\r\na broad black belt, in which are powder-flask and knife, with a bugle\r\nslung over his shoulder, a slouched hat, and high top-boots. During\r\ndinner a number of chance cavaliers drop in, entirely without ceremony,\r\nin hunter’s costume, as they return from the chase. Then at night, or\r\nrather early in the morning, (for the Brazilian habit is “early to bed\r\nand early to rise,” in order to avoid the heat,) what jollity and song,\r\nsounding the bugles long before the dawn, twanging the guitar and\r\nwhistling on the peculiar instrument used here to call the game.\r\nAltogether it is the most novel and interesting collection of social\r\nelements, mingling after a kind of picnic fashion without the least\r\nformality, and we feel every day how much we owe to our kind hosts for\r\nadmitting us to an occasion where one sees so much of what is national\r\nand characteristic. The next day we went to breakfast at a smaller\r\nfazenda belonging also to Senhor Lage, higher up on the Serra da\r\nBabylonia. Again, starting before sunrise, we went slowly up the\r\nmountain, the summit of which is over 3,000 feet above the sea level. We\r\nwere preceded by the “liteira,” a queer kind of car slung between two\r\nmules, in which rode the grandmamma and the baby; as carriages are\r\nimpossible on these mountain roads, some such conveyance is necessary\r\nfor those who are too old or too young for horseback travelling. The\r\nview was lovely, the morning cool and beautiful, and after a two hours’\r\nride we arrived at the upper fazenda. Here we left our horses and went\r\non foot into the forest, where the ladies and children wandered about,\r\ngathering flowers and exploring the wood walks, while the gentlemen\r\noccupied themselves with fishing and hunting till midday, when we\r\nreturned to the house to breakfast. The result of the chase was a\r\nmonkey, two caititú (wild pigs), and a great variety of birds, all of\r\nwhich went to swell the scientific collections.[39] We returned to dine\r\nat the lower fazenda, and all retired soon after, for the next day the\r\ngreat hunt of the week would take place, and we were to be early astir.\r\n\r\nAt dawn the horses were at the door, and we were mounting the Serra\r\nbefore sunrise. We were bound to a fazenda on the Serra da Babylonia,\r\nsome two leagues from the one at which we were staying, and on higher\r\nground, too high indeed for the culture of coffee, and devoted to\r\npasture land. It is here that Senhor Lage has his horses and cattle. The\r\nride along the zigzag road winding up the Serra was delightful in the\r\nearly morning. The clouds were flushed with the dawn; the distant hills\r\nand the forest, spreading endlessly beneath us, glowed in the sunrise.\r\nThe latter part of the road lay mostly through the woods, and brought us\r\nout, after some two hours’ ride, on the brow of a hill overlooking a\r\nsmall lake, sunk in a cuplike depression of the mountain, just beyond\r\nwhich was the fazenda. The scenic effect was very pretty, for the border\r\nof the lake was ornamented with flags, and on its waters floated a\r\nlittle miniature steamer with the American flag at one end and the\r\nBrazilian at the other. Our host invited us to ride in at the gate of\r\nthe fazenda, in advance of the rest of our cavalcade, a request which we\r\nunderstood when, as we passed the entrance, the little steamer put into\r\nshore, and, firing a salute in our honor, showed its name, AGASSIZ, in\r\nfull. It was a pleasant surprise very successfully managed. After the\r\nlittle excitement of this incident was over, we went to the house to tie\r\nup our riding-habits and prepare for the woods. We then embarked in the\r\nnewly-christened boat and crossed the lake to a forest on the other\r\nside. Here were rustic tables and seats arranged under a tent where we\r\nwere to breakfast; but while the meal was making ready and a fire\r\nbuilding for the boiling of coffee, the stewing of chicken, rice, and\r\nother creature comforts, we wandered at will in the wood. This was the\r\nmost beautiful, because the wildest and most primitive, specimen of\r\ntropical forest we have yet seen. I think no description prepares one\r\nfor the difference between this forest and our own, even though the\r\nlatter be the “forest primeval.” It is not merely the difference of the\r\nvegetation, but the impenetrability of the mass here that makes the\r\ndensity, darkness, and solemnity of the woods so impressive. It seems as\r\nif the mode of growth—many of the trees shooting up to an immense\r\nheight, but branching only toward the top—were meant to give room to the\r\nlegion of parasites, sipos, lianas, and climbing plants of all kinds\r\nwhich fill the intervening spaces. There is one fact which makes the\r\nstudy of the tropical forest as interesting to the geologist as to the\r\nbotanist, namely, its relation to the vegetable world of past ages\r\nhidden in the rocks. The tree-ferns, the Chamærops, the Pandanus, the\r\nAraucarias, are all modern representatives of past types, and this walk\r\nin the forest was an important one to Mr. Agassiz, because he made out\r\none of those laws of growth which unite the past and the present. The\r\nChamærops is a palm belonging to the ancient vegetable world, but having\r\nits representatives in our days. The modern Chamærops, with its fan-like\r\nleaves spreading on one level, stands structurally lower than the Palms\r\nwith pinnate leaves, which belong almost exclusively to our geological\r\nage, and have numerous leaflets arranged along either side of a central\r\naxis. The young Palms were exceedingly numerous, springing up at every\r\nstep upon our path, some of them not more than two inches high, while\r\ntheir elders towered fifty feet above them. Mr. Agassiz gathered and\r\nexamined great numbers of them, and found that the young Palms, to\r\nwhatever genus they may belong, invariably resemble the Chamærops,\r\nhaving their leaves extending fan-like on one plane, instead of being\r\nscattered along a central axis, as in the adult tree. The infant Palm is\r\nin fact the mature Chamærops in miniature, showing that among plants as\r\namong animals, at least in some instances, there is a correspondence\r\nbetween the youngest stages of growth in the higher species of a given\r\ntype and the earliest introduction of that type on earth.[40]\r\n\r\nAt the close of our ramble, from which the Professor returned looking\r\nnot unlike an ambulatory representative of tropical vegetation, being\r\nloaded down with palm-branches, tree-ferns, and the like, we found\r\nbreakfast awaiting us. Some of our party were missing, however, the\r\nhunters having already taken their stations at some distance near the\r\nwater. The game was an Anta (Tapir), a curious animal, abounding in the\r\nwoods of this region. It has a special interest for the naturalist,\r\nbecause it resembles certain ancient mammalia now found only among the\r\nfossils, just as the tree-fern, Chamærops, &c. resemble past vegetable\r\ntypes. Although Mr. Agassiz had seen it in confinement, he had a great\r\ndesire to observe it in action under its natural condition, and in the\r\nmidst of a tropical forest as characteristic of old geological times as\r\nthe creature itself. It was, in fact, to gratify this desire that Mr.\r\nLage had planned the hunt. “L’homme propose et Dieu dispose,” however,\r\nand, as the sequel will show, we were not destined to see an Anta this\r\nday. The forest being, as I have said, impenetrable to the hunter,\r\nexcept where paths have been cut, the game is roused by sending the dogs\r\ninto the wood, the sportsmen stationing themselves at certain distances\r\non the outskirts. The Anta has his haunts near lakes or rivers, and when\r\nwearied and heated with the chase he generally makes for the water, and,\r\nspringing in, is shot as he swims across. As we were lingering over the\r\nbreakfast-table we heard the shout of Anta! Anta! In an instant every\r\nman sprang to his gun and ran down to the water-side, while we all stood\r\nwaiting, listening to the cries of the dogs, now frantic with\r\nexcitement, and expecting every moment the rush of the hunted animal and\r\nhis spring into the lake. But it was a false alarm; the cries of the\r\ndogs died away in the distance: the day was colder than usual, the Anta\r\nturned back from the water, and, leading his pursuers a weary chase, was\r\nlost in the forest. After a time the dogs returned, looking tired and\r\ndispirited. But though we missed the Tapir, we saw enough of the sport\r\nto understand what makes the charm to the hunter of watching for hours\r\nin the woods, and perhaps returning, after all, empty-handed. If he does\r\nnot get the game, he has the emotion; every now and then he thinks the\r\ncreature is at hand, and he has a momentary agitation, heightened by the\r\ncries of the dogs and the answering cry of the sportsmen, who strive to\r\narouse them to the utmost by their own shouts, and then if the animal\r\nturns back into the thicket all sound dies away, and to a very\r\npandemonium of voices succeed the silence and solitude of the forest.\r\nAll these things have their fascination, and explain to the uninitiated,\r\nto whom it seems at first incomprehensible, why these men will wait\r\nmotionless for hours, and think themselves repaid (as I heard one of\r\nthem declare) if they only hear the cry of the dogs and know they have\r\nroused the game, even if there be no other result. However, in this\r\ninstance, we had plenty of other booty. The Anta lost, the hunters, who\r\nhad carefully avoided firing hitherto, lest the sounds of their guns\r\nshould give him warning, now turned their attention to lesser game, and\r\nwe rode home in the afternoon rich in spoils, though without a Tapir.\r\n\r\nThe next day was that of our departure. Before leaving, we rode with Mr.\r\nLage through his plantation, that we might understand something of the\r\nprocess of coffee culture in this country. I am not sure that, in giving\r\nan account of this model fazenda, we give a just idea of fazendas in\r\ngeneral. Its owner carries the same large and comprehensive spirit, the\r\nsame energy and force of will, into all his undertakings, and has\r\nintroduced extensive reforms on his plantations. The Fazenda da\r\nFortaleza de Santa Anna lies at the foot of the Serra da Babylonia. The\r\nhouse itself, as I have already said, makes a part of a succession of\r\nlow white buildings, enclosing an oblong square divided into neat lots,\r\ndestined for the drying of coffee. This drying of the coffee in the\r\nimmediate vicinity of the house, though it seems a very general custom,\r\nmust be an uncomfortable one; for the drying-lots are laid down in a\r\ndazzling white cement, from the glare of which, in this hot climate, the\r\neye turns wearily away, longing for a green spot on which to rest. Just\r\nbehind the house on the slope of the hill is the orangery. I am never\r\ntired of these golden orchards, and this was one of especial beauty. The\r\nsmall, deep-colored tangerines, sometimes twenty or thirty in one\r\ncluster, the large, choice orange, “Laranja selecta,” as it is called,\r\noften ten or twelve together in a single bunch, and bearing the branches\r\nto the ground with their weight; the paler “Limaō dôce,” or sweet lemon,\r\nrather insipid, but greatly esteemed here for its cool, refreshing\r\nproperties,—all these, with many others,—for the variety of oranges is\r\nfar greater than we of the temperate zone conceive it to be,—make a mass\r\nof color in which gold, deep orange, and pale yellow are blended\r\nwonderfully with the background of green. Beyond the house enclosure, on\r\nthe opposite side of the road, are the gardens, with aviary, and\r\nfish-ponds in the centre. With these exceptions, all of the property\r\nwhich is not forest is devoted to coffee, covering all the hillsides for\r\nmiles around. The seed is planted in nurseries especially prepared,\r\nwhere it undergoes its first year’s growth. It is then transplanted to\r\nits permanent home, and begins to bear in about three years, the first\r\ncrop being of course a very light one. From that time forward, under\r\ngood care and with favorable soil, it will continue to bear and even to\r\nyield two crops or more annually, for thirty years in succession. At\r\nthat time the shrubs and the soil are alike exhausted, and, according to\r\nthe custom of the country, the fazendeiro cuts down a new forest and\r\nbegins a new plantation, completely abandoning his old one, without a\r\nthought of redeeming or fertilizing the exhausted land. One of the\r\nlong-sighted reforms undertaken by our host is the manuring of all the\r\nold, deserted plantations on his estate; he has already a number of\r\nvigorous young plantations, which promise to be as good as if a virgin\r\nforest had been sacrificed to produce them. He wishes not only to\r\npreserve the wood on his own estate, and to show that agriculture need\r\nnot be cultivated at the expense of taste and beauty, but to remind his\r\ncountry people also, that, extensive as are the forests, they will not\r\nlast forever, and that it will be necessary to emigrate before long to\r\nfind new coffee grounds, if the old ones are to be considered worthless.\r\nAnother of his reforms is that of the roads, already alluded to. The\r\nordinary roads in the coffee plantations, like the mule-tracks all over\r\nthe country, are carried straight up the sides of the hills between the\r\nlines of shrubs, gullied by every rain, and offering, besides, so steep\r\nan ascent that even with eight or ten oxen it is often impossible to\r\ndrive the clumsy, old-fashioned carts up the slope, and the negroes are\r\nobliged to bring a great part of the harvest down on their heads. An\r\nAmerican, who has been a great deal on the coffee fazendas in this\r\nregion, told me that he had seen negroes bringing enormous burdens of\r\nthis kind on their heads down almost vertical slopes. On Senhor Lage’s\r\nestate all these old roads are abandoned, except where they are planted\r\nhere and there with alleys of orange-trees for the use of the negroes,\r\nand he has substituted for them winding roads in the side of the hill\r\nwith a very gradual ascent, so that light carts dragged by a single mule\r\ncan transport all the harvest from the summit of the plantation to the\r\ndrying-ground. It was the harvesting season, and the spectacle was a\r\npretty one. The negroes, men and women, were scattered about the\r\nplantations with broad, shallow trays, made of plaited grass or bamboo,\r\nstrapped over their shoulders and supported at their waists; into these\r\nthey were gathering the coffee, some of the berries being brilliantly\r\nred, some already beginning to dry and turn brown, while here and there\r\nwas a green one not yet quite ripe, but soon to ripen in the scorching\r\nsun. Little black children were sitting on the ground and gathering what\r\nfell under the bushes, singing at their work a monotonous but rather\r\npretty snatch of song in which some took the first and others the\r\nsecond, making a not inharmonious music. As their baskets were filled\r\nthey came to the Administrador to receive a little metal ticket on which\r\nthe amount of their work was marked. A task is allotted to each one,—so\r\nmuch to a full-grown man, so much to a woman with young children, so\r\nmuch to a child,—and each one is paid for whatever he may do over and\r\nabove it. The requisition is a very moderate one, so that the\r\nindustrious have an opportunity of making a little money independently.\r\nAt night they all present their tickets and are paid on the spot for any\r\nextra work. From the harvesting-ground we followed the carts down to the\r\nplace where their burden is deposited. On their return from the\r\nplantation the negroes divide the day’s harvest, and dispose it in\r\nlittle mounds on the drying-ground. When pretty equally dried, the\r\ncoffee is spread out in thin even layers over the whole enclosure, where\r\nit is baked for the last time. It is then hulled by a very simple\r\nmachine in use on almost all the fazendas, and the process is complete.\r\nAt noon we bade good by to our kind hosts, and started for Juiz de Fora.\r\nOur stage was not a bad imitation of Noah’s ark, for we carried with us\r\nthe beasts of the field and the birds of the air and the fishes from the\r\nwaters,[41] to say nothing of the trees from the forest. The party with\r\nwhom we had passed such pleasant days collected to bid us farewell, and\r\nfollowed us, as we passed out from the gate, with vivas and waving hats\r\nand handkerchiefs.\r\n\r\nThe following day we were fortunate in having cool weather with a\r\nsomewhat cloudy sky, so that our ride of ten hours from Juiz de Fora to\r\nPetropolis, on the top of the stage, was delightful. The next morning in\r\ndriving down the Serra to Mauá we witnessed a singular phenomenon,\r\ncommon enough, I suppose, to those who live in high regions. As we\r\nturned the corner of the road which first brings us in sight of the\r\nmagnificent view below the Serra, there was a general exclamation of\r\nsurprise and admiration. The valley and harbor, quite out to the sea,\r\nwere changed to a field of snow, white, soft, and fleecy, as if fallen\r\nthat night. The illusion was perfect, and though recognized at once as\r\nsimply an effect of the heavy morning fog, we could hardly believe that\r\nit would disperse at our approach and not prove to be the thing it\r\nseemed. Here and there the summit of a hill pierced through it like an\r\nisland, making the deception more complete. The incident was especially\r\ninteresting to us as connecting itself with our late discussions as to\r\nthe possible former existence of glaciers in this region. In his lecture\r\na few nights before, describing the greater extension of the ice in\r\nformer geological ages, when the whole plain of Switzerland between the\r\nAlps and Jura must have been filled with glaciers, Mr. Agassiz had said\r\n“there is a phenomenon not uncommon in the autumn in Switzerland which\r\nmay help us to reconstruct this wonderful picture. Sometimes in a\r\nSeptember morning the whole plain of Switzerland is filled with vapor\r\nwhich, when its pure white, undulating surface is seen from the higher\r\nsummits of the Jura, looks like a snowy ‘mer de glace,’ appearing to\r\ndescend from the peaks of the Alps and extending toward the Jura, while\r\nfrom all the tributary valleys similar masses pour down to meet it.” It\r\nwas as if the valley and harbor of Rio had meant to offer us a similar\r\npicture of past times, with the image of which our minds had been filled\r\nfor the last few days in consequence of the glacial phenomena constantly\r\npresented to us on our journey.\r\n\r\n_July 6th._—To-morrow was to have been the day of our departure for the\r\nAmazons, but private interests must yield to public good, and it seems\r\nthat the steamer which was to have left for Pará to-morrow has been\r\ntaken by the government to transport troops to the seat of war. The\r\naspect of the war grows daily more serious, and the Emperor goes himself\r\nthe day after to-morrow to Rio Grande do Sul, accompanied by his\r\nson-in-law, the Duke of Saxe, soon to be followed by the Conte d’Eu, who\r\nis expected by the French steamer of the 18th of this month. Under these\r\ncircumstances, not only are we prevented from going at the appointed\r\ndate, but it seems not improbable that the exigencies of war may cause a\r\nstill further delay, should other steamers be needed. A very pleasant\r\npublic dinner, intended to be on the eve of his departure, was given to\r\nMr. Agassiz yesterday by Messrs. Fleiuss and Linde. Germans, Swiss,\r\nFrench, Americans, and Brazilians made up the company, a mingling of\r\nnationalities which resulted in a very general harmony.\r\n\r\n_July 9th._—For some time Mr. Agassiz has been trying to get living\r\nspecimens of the insect so injurious to the coffee-tree; the larva of a\r\nlittle moth akin to those which destroy the vineyards in Europe.\r\nYesterday he succeeded in obtaining some, and among them one just\r\nspinning his cocoon on the leaf. We watched him for a long time with the\r\nlens as he wove his filmy tent. He had arched the threads upwards in the\r\ncentre, so as to leave a little hollow space into which he could\r\nwithdraw; this tiny vault seemed to be completed at the moment we saw\r\nhim, and he was drawing threads forward and fastening them at a short\r\ndistance beyond, thus lashing his house to the leaf as it were. The\r\nexquisite accuracy of the work was amazing. He was spinning the thread\r\nwith his mouth, and with every new stitch he turned his body backward,\r\nattached his thread to the same spot, then drew it forward and fastened\r\nit exactly on a line with the last, with a precision and rapidity that\r\nmachinery could hardly imitate. It is a curious question how far this\r\nperfection of workmanship in many of the lower animals is simply\r\nidentical with their organization, and therefore to be considered a\r\nfunction, as inevitable in its action as digestion or respiration,\r\nrather than an instinct. In this case the body of the little animal was\r\nhis measure: it was amazing to see him lay down his threads with such\r\naccuracy, till one remembered that he could not make them longer or\r\nshorter; for, starting from the centre of his house, and stretching his\r\nbody its full length, they must always reach the same point. The same is\r\ntrue of the so-called mathematics of the bee. The bees stand as close as\r\nthey can together in their hive for economy of space, and each one\r\ndeposits his wax around him, his own form and size being the mould for\r\nthe cells, the regularity of which when completed excites so much wonder\r\nand admiration. The mathematical secret of the bee is to be found in his\r\nstructure, not in his instinct. But in the industrial work of some of\r\nthe lower animals, the ant for instance, there is a power of adaptation\r\nwhich is not susceptible of the same explanation. Their social\r\norganization, too intelligent, it seems, to be the work of any reasoning\r\npowers of their own, yet does not appear to be directly connected with\r\ntheir structure. While we were watching our little insect, a breath\r\nstirred the leaf and he instantly contracted himself and drew back under\r\nhis roof; but presently came out again and returned to his work.\r\n\r\n_July 14th._—I have passed two or three days of this week very\r\npleasantly with a party of friends who invited me to join them on a\r\nvisit to one of the largest fazendas in this neighborhood, belonging to\r\nthe Commendador Breves. A journey of some four hours on the Dom Pedro\r\nRailroad brought us to the “Barra do Pirahy,” and thence we proceeded on\r\nmule-back, riding slowly along the banks of the Parahyba through very\r\npleasant, quiet scenery, though much less picturesque than that in the\r\nimmediate vicinity of Rio. At about sunset we reached the fazenda,\r\nstanding on a terrace just above the river, and commanding a lovely view\r\nof water and woodland. We were received with a hospitality hardly to be\r\nequalled, I think, out of Brazil, for it asks neither who you are nor\r\nwhence you come, but opens its doors to every wayfarer. On this occasion\r\nwe were expected; but it is nevertheless true that at such a fazenda,\r\nwhere the dining-room accommodates a hundred persons if necessary, all\r\ntravellers passing through the country are free to stop for rest and\r\nrefreshment. At the time of our visit there were several such transient\r\nguests; among others a couple quite unknown to our hosts, who had\r\nstopped for the night, but had been taken ill and detained there several\r\ndays. They seemed entirely at home. On this estate there are about two\r\nthousand slaves, thirty of whom are house-servants; it includes within\r\nits own borders all that would be required by such a population in the\r\nway of supplies: it has its drug-shop and its hospital; its kitchens for\r\nthe service of the guests and for that of the numerous indoor servants,\r\nits church, its priest, and its doctor. Here the church was made by\r\nthrowing open a small oratory, very handsomely fitted up with gold and\r\nsilver service, purple altar-cloth, &c., at the end of a very long room,\r\nwhich, though used for other purposes, serves on such an occasion to\r\ncollect the large household together. The next morning our hostess\r\nshowed us the different working-rooms. One of the most interesting was\r\nthat where the children were taught to sew. I have wondered, on our\r\nSouthern plantations, that more pains was not taken to make clever\r\nseamstresses of the women. Here plain sewing is taught to all the little\r\ngirls, and many of them are quite expert in embroidery and lace-making.\r\nBeyond this room was a storeroom for clothing, looking not unlike one of\r\nour sanitary rooms, with heaps of woollen and cotton stuffs which the\r\nblack women were cutting out and making up for the field hands. The\r\nkitchens, with the working and lodging rooms of the house negroes,\r\nenclosed a court planted with trees and shrubs, around which extended\r\ncovered brick walks where blacks, young and old, seemed to swarm, from\r\nthe withered woman who boasted herself a hundred, but was still proud to\r\ndisplay her fine lace-work, and ran like a girl, to show us how\r\nsprightly she was, to the naked baby creeping at her feet. The old woman\r\nhad received her liberty some time ago, but seemed to be very much\r\nattached to the family and never to have thought of leaving them. These\r\nare the things which make one hopeful about slavery in Brazil;\r\nemancipation is considered there a subject to be discussed, legislated\r\nupon, adopted ultimately, and it seems no uncommon act to present a\r\nslave with his liberty. In the evening, while taking coffee on the\r\nterrace after dinner, we had very good music from a brass-band composed\r\nof slaves belonging to the estate. The love of the negroes for music is\r\nalways remarkable, and here they take pains to cultivate it. Senhor\r\nBreves keeps a teacher for them, and they are really very well trained.\r\nAt a later hour we had the band in the house and a dance by the black\r\nchildren which was comical in the extreme. Like little imps of darkness\r\nthey looked, dancing with a rapidity of movement and gleeful enjoyment\r\nwith which one could not but sympathize. While the music was going on,\r\nevery door and window was filled with a cloud of dusky faces, now and\r\nthen a fair one among them; for here, as elsewhere, slavery brings its\r\ninevitable and heaviest curse, and white slaves are by no means\r\nuncommon. The next morning we left the fazenda, not on mule-back,\r\nhowever, but in one of the flat-bottomed coffee-boats, an agreeable\r\nexchange for the long, hot ride. We were accompanied to the landing by\r\nour kind hosts, and followed by quite a train of blacks, some of them\r\nbringing the baggage, others coming only for the amusement of seeing us\r\noff. Among them was the old black woman who gave us the heartiest cheers\r\nof all, as we put off from the shore. The sail down the river was very\r\npleasant; the coffee-bags served as cushions, and, with all our\r\numbrellas raised to make an awning, we contrived to shelter ourselves\r\nfrom the sun. Neither was the journey without excitement, the river\r\nbeing so broken by rocks in many places that there are strong rapids,\r\nrequiring a skilful navigation.\r\n\r\n_July 15th._—A long botanizing excursion to-day among the Tijuca hills\r\nwith Mr. Glaziou, director of the Passeio Publico, as guide. It has been\r\na piece of the good fortune attending Mr. Agassiz thus far on this\r\nexpedition to find in Mr. Glaziou a botanist whose practical familiarity\r\nwith tropical plants is as thorough as his theoretical knowledge. He has\r\nundertaken to enrich our scientific stores with a large collection of\r\nsuch palms and other trees as illustrate the relation between the\r\npresent tropical vegetation and the ancient geological forests. Such a\r\ncollection will be invaluable as a basis for palæontological studies at\r\nthe Museum of Comparative Zoölogy in Cambridge.\r\n\r\n_July 23d._—At last our plans for the Amazons seem definitely settled.\r\nWe sail the day after to-morrow by the Cruzeiro do Sul. The conduct of\r\nthe government toward the expedition is very generous; free passages are\r\ngranted to the whole party, and yesterday Mr. Agassiz received an\r\nofficial document enjoining all persons connected with the\r\nadministration to give him every facility for his scientific objects. We\r\nhave another piece of good fortune in the addition to our party of Major\r\nCoutinho, a member of the government corps of engineers, who has been\r\nengaged for several years in explorations on the Amazonian rivers.\r\nHappily for us, he returned to Rio a few weeks ago, and a chance meeting\r\nat the palace, where he had gone to report the results of the journey\r\njust completed, and Mr. Agassiz to discuss the plans for that about to\r\nbegin, brought them together. This young officer’s investigations had\r\nmade his name familiar to Mr. Agassiz, and when the Emperor asked the\r\nlatter how he could best assist him, he answered that there was nothing\r\nhe so much desired or which would so materially aid him as the\r\ncompanionship of Major Coutinho. The Emperor cordially consented, Major\r\nCoutinho signified his readiness, and the matter was concluded. Since\r\nthen there have been frequent conferences between Mr. Agassiz and his\r\nnew colleague, intent study of maps and endless talk about the most\r\ndesirable mode of laying out and dividing the work. He feels that Major\r\nCoutinho’s familiarity with the scenes to which we are going will\r\nlighten his task of half its difficulties, while his, scientific zeal\r\nwill make him a most sympathetic companion.[42] We found to-day some\r\nlarge leaves of the Terminalia Catappa of the most brilliant colors; red\r\nand gold as bright as any of our autumnal leaves. This would seem to\r\nconfirm the opinion that the turning of the foliage with us is not an\r\neffect of frost, but simply the ripening of the leaf; since here, where\r\nthere is no frost, the same phenomenon takes place as in our northern\r\nlatitudes.\r\n\r\n_July 24th._—Our last preparations for the journey are completed; the\r\ncollections made since our arrival, amounting to upwards of fifty\r\nbarrels and cases, are packed, in readiness for the first opportunity\r\nwhich occurs for the United States, and to-morrow morning we shall be on\r\nour way to the great river. We went this morning to the Collegio Dom\r\nPedro Segundo to bid farewell to our excellent friend Dr. Pacheco, to\r\nwhose kindness we owe much of our enjoyment during our stay here. The\r\nCollege building was once a “seminario,” a charitable institution where\r\nboys were taken to be educated as priests. The rules of the\r\nestablishment were strict; no servants were kept, the pupils were\r\nobliged to do their own work, cooking, &c., and even to go out into the\r\nstreets to beg after the fashion of the mendicant orders. One condition\r\nonly was attached to the entrance of the children, namely, that they\r\nshould be of pure race; no mulattoes or negroes were admitted. I do not\r\nknow on what ground this institution was broken up by the government and\r\nthe building taken as a school-house. It has still a slightly monastic\r\naspect, though it has been greatly modified; but the cloisters running\r\naround closed courts remind one of its origin. The recitations were\r\ngoing on at the moment of our visit, and as we had seen nothing as yet\r\nof the schools, Dr. Pacheco took us through the establishment. A college\r\nhere does not signify a university as with us, but rather a high school,\r\nthe age of the pupils being from twelve to eighteen. It is difficult to\r\njudge of methods of education in a foreign language with which one is\r\nnot very familiar. But the scholars appeared bright and interested,\r\ntheir answers came promptly, their discipline was evidently good. One\r\nthing was very striking to a stranger in seeing so many young people\r\ncollected together; namely, the absence of pure type and the feeble\r\nphysique. I do not know whether it is in consequence of the climate, but\r\na healthy, vigorous child is a rare sight in Rio de Janeiro. The\r\nscholars were of all colors, from black through intermediate shades to\r\nwhite, and even one of the teachers having the direction of a higher\r\nclass in Latin was a negro. It is an evidence of the absence of any\r\nprejudice against the blacks, that, on the occasion of a recent vacancy\r\namong the Latin professors, this man, having passed the best\r\nexamination, was unanimously chosen in preference to several Brazilians,\r\nof European descent, who presented themselves as candidates at the same\r\ntime. After hearing several of the classes we went over the rest of the\r\nbuilding. The order and exquisite neatness of the whole establishment,\r\nnot forgetting the kitchen, where the shining brasses and bright tins\r\nmight awaken the envy of many a housekeeper, bear testimony to the\r\nexcellence of the general direction. Since the institution passed into\r\nDr. Pacheco’s hands he has done a great deal to raise its character. He\r\nhas improved the library, purchased instruments for the laboratory, and\r\nmade many judicious changes in the general arrangement.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 32:\r\n\r\n  Mr. Agassiz was prevented from making this excursion.\r\n\r\nFootnote 33:\r\n\r\n  Though a resident of the United States for nearly twenty years, Mr.\r\n  Agassiz was only naturalized in 1863. At the moment when a general\r\n  distrust of our institutions prevailed in Europe, it was a\r\n  satisfaction to him to testify by some personal and public act his\r\n  confidence in them.\r\n\r\nFootnote 34:\r\n\r\n  A short account of these explorations may be found at the end of the\r\n  volume.—L. A.\r\n\r\nFootnote 35:\r\n\r\n  I am particularly indebted to Senator Th. Ottoni, Baron de Prados,\r\n  Senator Pompeo, Senator Paranagua, Senhor Paula Souza, and Senhor J.\r\n  B. da Fonseca, for information, maps, and other documents relative to\r\n  the regions intended to be explored by my young friends and myself.—L.\r\n  A.\r\n\r\nFootnote 36:\r\n\r\n  Since it was reported in the newspapers that the proceeds of these\r\n  lectures were devoted to the expedition, it may be well to mention\r\n  here that they were free, given simply at the request of the Emperor,\r\n  and open to all without charge.\r\n\r\nFootnote 37:\r\n\r\n  Mr. Agassiz was indebted to Senhor Machado for a valuable series of\r\n  photographs and stereoscopic views of this region, begun on this\r\n  excursion and completed during our absence in the North of Brazil.\r\n\r\nFootnote 38:\r\n\r\n  The most complete account of these curious animals is to be found in\r\n  Bates’s “Naturalist on the Amazons.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 39:\r\n\r\n  I was especially interested in examining the vegetable productions of\r\n  a little lake, hardly larger than a mill-pond, near this fazenda. It\r\n  was strange to see Potamogeton and Myriophyllum, plants which we\r\n  associate exclusively with the fresh waters of the temperate zone,\r\n  growing in the shadow of tropical forests where monkeys have their\r\n  home. Such combinations are very puzzling to the student of the laws\r\n  of geographical distribution.—L. A.\r\n\r\nFootnote 40:\r\n\r\n  In the same way, it may be said that in its incipient growth the\r\n  Dicotyledonous Plant exhibits, in the structure of its germinative\r\n  leaves, the characteristic features of Monocotyledonous Plants.—L. A.\r\n\r\nFootnote 41:\r\n\r\n  Senhor Lage had caused an extensive collection of fishes to be\r\n  gathered from the waters of the Rio Novo, so that this excursion\r\n  greatly extended the range of my survey of the basin of the\r\n  Parahyba.—L. A.\r\n\r\nFootnote 42:\r\n\r\n  Never were pleasant anticipations more delightfully fulfilled. During\r\n  eleven months of the most intimate companionship I had daily cause to\r\n  be grateful for the chance which had thrown us together. I found in\r\n  Major Coutinho an able collaborator, untiring in his activity and\r\n  devotion to scientific aims, an admirable guide, and a friend whose\r\n  regard I trust I shall ever retain.—L.

Our party consists of Major Coutinho, Mr. Burkhardt,\r\nMonsieur Bourget, who accompanies Mr. Agassiz to the Amazons as\r\ncollector and preparator, our two young friends Mr. Hunnewell and Mr.\r\nJames, and ourselves. At Bahia we shall be joined by Mr. Dexter and Mr.\r\nThayer, two of our party who have preceded us up the coast, and have\r\nbeen collecting in the neighborhood of Bahia for two or three weeks. The\r\naspect of the steamer is not very inviting, for it has been used of late\r\nfor the transportation of troops to the south, in consequence of which\r\nit is very dirty; it is also overcrowded on account of the number of\r\npersons bound northward, who have been detained in Rio by the\r\ninterruption of the regular trips on this line. We are promised better\r\naccommodations after a few days, however, as many of the passengers will\r\ndrop off at Bahia and Pernambuco.\r\n\r\n_July 28th._—Bahia. Half the enjoyment of life borrows intensity from\r\ncontrast, and to this principle we certainly owe a part of our pleasure\r\nto-day. After three half sea-sick days on a dirty, crowded steamer, the\r\nchange is delightful to a breezy country house, where we are received\r\nwith that most gracious hospitality which relieves both host and guests\r\nof the sense of entertaining or being entertained. Here I have been\r\nsitting under the deep shade of a huge mango-tree, with a number of the\r\n“Revue des Deux Mondes” on my knee, either reading or listening lazily\r\nto the rustle of the leaves or the cooing of the pigeons as they patter\r\nup and down on the tiled floor of the porch near by, or watching the\r\nnegroes as they come and go with trays of vegetables or baskets of fruit\r\nand flowers on their heads, for the service of the house. In the mean\r\ntime, Mr. Agassiz is engaged in examining the collections made by Mr.\r\nDexter and Mr. Thayer during their visit here. They have been aided most\r\ncordially by our friend Mr. Antonio de Lacerda, at whose hospitable\r\nhouse we are staying, and where we found our travelling companions quite\r\ndomesticated. He received them on their arrival, and has given them\r\nevery facility during their stay here for the objects they had in view,\r\nhis own love of natural history, to which he devotes every spare hour\r\nfrom his active business life, rendering him an efficient ally. He has a\r\nlarge and very valuable collection of insects, admirably arranged and in\r\nexcellent preservation. They are also greatly indebted to Mr. Nicolai,\r\nthe resident English clergyman here, who has accompanied them on some of\r\ntheir excursions, and put them in the way of seeing whatever was most\r\ninteresting in the neighborhood.\r\n\r\nOn arriving in South America one should land first in Bahia, for in its\r\naspect it is the most national and characteristic of the cities. As we\r\npassed directly through the town this morning, we can give but little\r\naccount of it, and yet we saw enough to confirm all that has been said\r\nof its quaint and picturesque character. On first disembarking, you find\r\nyourself at the foot of an almost perpendicular hill, and negro-bearers\r\nappear at your side to carry you up the steep ascent, almost impassable\r\nfor carriages, in a “cadeira,” or curtained chair. This is in itself an\r\nodd experience for one to whom it is new, and the rest of the city, with\r\nits precipitous streets, its queer houses, its old churches, is as\r\nquaint and antique as these original carriages.\r\n\r\n_July 29th._—To-day we have the “revers de la médaille”; we have\r\nreturned to our prison, and a violent rain drives us all to take refuge\r\nin the hot, close dining-room, our only resort when the weather is bad.\r\n\r\n_July 30th._—Off Maceió. Last evening, when the rain was over and the\r\nmoonlight tempted every one on deck, we had a long conversation with our\r\npleasant travelling companion, Mr. Sinimbu, senator from the province of\r\nAlagôas, on the aspect of slavery in Brazil. It seems to me that we may\r\nhave something to learn here in our own perplexities respecting the\r\nposition of the black race among us, for the Brazilians are trying\r\ngradually and by installments some of the experiments which are forced\r\nupon us without previous preparation. The absence of all restraint upon\r\nthe free blacks, the fact that they are eligible to office, and that all\r\nprofessional careers are open to them, without prejudice on the ground\r\nof color, enables one to form some opinion as to their ability and\r\ncapacity for development. Mr. Sinimbu tells us that here the result is\r\non the whole in their favor; he says that the free blacks compare well\r\nin intelligence and activity with the Brazilians and Portuguese. But it\r\nmust be remembered, in making the comparison with reference to our own\r\ncountry, that here they are brought into contact with a less energetic\r\nand powerful race than the Anglo-Saxon. Mr. Sinimbu believes that\r\nemancipation is to be accomplished in Brazil by a gradual process which\r\nhas already begun. A large number of slaves are freed every year by the\r\nwills of their masters; a still larger number buy their own freedom\r\nannually; and as there is no longer any importation of blacks, the\r\ninevitable result of this must be the natural death of slavery.\r\nUnhappily, the process is a slow one, and in the mean while slavery is\r\ndoing its evil work, debasing and enfeebling alike whites and blacks.\r\nThe Brazilians themselves do not deny this, and one constantly hears\r\nthem lament the necessity of sending their children away to be educated,\r\non account of the injurious association with the house-servants. In\r\nfact, although politically slavery has a more hopeful aspect here than\r\nelsewhere, the institution from a moral point of view has some of its\r\nmost revolting characters in this country, and looks, if possible, more\r\nodious than it did in the States. The other day, in the neighborhood of\r\nRio, I had an opportunity of seeing a marriage between two negroes,\r\nwhose owner made the religious, or, as it appeared to me on this\r\noccasion, irreligious ceremony, obligatory. The bride, who was as black\r\nas jet, was dressed in white muslin, with a veil of coarse white lace,\r\nsuch as the negro women make themselves, and the husband was in a white\r\nlinen suit. She looked, and I think she really felt, diffident, for\r\nthere were a good many strangers present, and her position was\r\nembarrassing. The Portuguese priest, a bold, insolent-looking man,\r\ncalled them up and rattled over the marriage service with most\r\nirreverent speed, stopping now and then to scold them both, but\r\nespecially the woman, because she did not speak loud enough and did not\r\ntake the whole thing in the same coarse, rough way that he did. When he\r\nordered them to come up and kneel at the altar, his tone was more\r\nsuggestive of cursing than praying, and having uttered his blessing he\r\nhurled an amen at them, slammed the prayer-book down on the altar,\r\nwhiffed out the candles, and turned the bride and bridegroom out of the\r\nchapel with as little ceremony as one would have kicked out a dog. As\r\nthe bride came out, half crying, half smiling, her mother met her and\r\nshowered her with rose-leaves, and so this act of consecration, in which\r\nthe mother’s benediction seemed the only grace, was over. I thought what\r\na strange confusion there must be in these poor creature’s minds, if\r\nthey thought about it at all. They are told that the relation between\r\nman and wife is a sin, unless confirmed by the sacred rite of marriage;\r\nthey come to hear a bad man gabble over them words which they cannot\r\nunderstand, mingled with taunts and abuse which they understand only too\r\nwell, and side by side with their own children grow up the little\r\nfair-skinned slaves to tell them practically that the white man does not\r\nkeep himself the law he imposes on them. What a monstrous lie the whole\r\nsystem must seem to them if they are ever led to think about it at all.\r\nI am far from supposing that the instance I have given should be taken\r\nas representing the state of religious instruction on plantations\r\ngenerally. No doubt there are good priests who improve and instruct\r\ntheir black parishioners; but it does not follow because religious\r\nservices are provided on a plantation, the ceremony of marriage\r\nobserved, &c., that there is anything which deserves the name of\r\nreligious instruction. It would be unjust not to add the better side of\r\nthe question in this particular instance. The man was free, and I was\r\ntold that the woman received her liberty and a piece of land from her\r\nmaster as her marriage dower.\r\n\r\nWe arrived at Maceió this morning, and went on shore with Mr. Sinimbu,\r\nwho leaves us here, and with whose family we passed a delightful day,\r\nwelcomed with that hearty cordiality so characteristic of Brazilians in\r\ntheir own homes. Although our stay was so short, a considerable addition\r\nwas made here to the collections. On arriving at any port the party\r\ndisperses at once, the young men going in different directions to\r\ncollect, Mr. Bourget hurrying to the fish-market to see what may be\r\nfound there of interest, and Mr. Agassiz and Mr. Coutinho generally\r\nmaking a geological excursion. In this way, though the steamer remains\r\nbut a few hours at each station, the time is not lost.\r\n\r\n_July 31st._—Pernambuco. Arrived to-day off Pernambuco, and were too\r\nhappy, after a stormy night, to find ourselves behind the famous reef\r\nwhich makes such a quiet harbor at this port. Our countryman, Mr. Hitch,\r\nmet us on landing, and drove us at once out to his “chacara,” (country\r\nplace,) where it was delightful to be welcomed, like old friends, to an\r\nAmerican home.[43] Pernambuco is by no means so picturesque as Bahia or\r\nRio de Janeiro. It has a more modern air than either of these, but looks\r\nalso more cleanly and more prosperous. Many of the streets are wide, and\r\nthe river running through the business part of the city, crossed by\r\nbroad, handsome bridges, is itself suggestive of freshness. The country\r\nis more open and flat than farther south. In our afternoon drive some of\r\nthe views across wide, level meadows, if we could have put elms here and\r\nthere in the place of palms, would have reminded us of scenery at home.\r\n\r\n_August 2d._—Yesterday we left Pernambuco, and this morning found\r\nourselves at the mouth of the Parahyba do Norte, a broad, beautiful\r\nriver, up which we steamed to within a few miles of the little town\r\nbearing the same name. Here we took a boat and rowed to the city, where\r\nwe spent some hours in rambling about, collecting specimens, examining\r\ndrift formations, &c. In the course of our excursion we fell in with\r\nsome friends of Major Coutinho’s, who took us home with them to an\r\nexcellent breakfast of fresh fish, with bread, coffee, and wine. The\r\nbread is to be noticed here, for it is said to be the best in Brazil.\r\nThe flour is the same as elsewhere, and the people generally attribute\r\nthe superiority of their bread to some quality of the water. Whatever be\r\nthe cause, there is no bread in all Brazil so sweet, so light, and so\r\nwhite as that of Parahyba do Norte.\r\n\r\n_August 5th._—We arrived yesterday at Ceará, where we were warmly\r\nwelcomed and most hospitably entertained at the house of Dr. Mendes, an\r\nold acquaintance of Major Coutinho. It was blowing hard and raining when\r\nwe left the steamer; our boat put into the beach in a heavy surf, and I\r\nwas wondering how I should reach the shore, when two of our negro rowers\r\njumped into the water, and, standing at the side of the boat behind me,\r\nmotioned me to come, crossing their arms basket-fashion, as we do\r\nsometimes to carry children. They looked as if it were the ordinary mode\r\nof conveyance, so I seated myself, and with one arm around the neck of\r\neach of my black bearers, they laughing as heartily as I did, I was\r\nlanded triumphantly on the sands. After the first greetings at the house\r\nof Dr. Mendes were over, we were offered the luxury of a bath before\r\nbreakfast. The bath is a very important feature in a Brazilian\r\nhousehold. This one was of the size of a small room, the water (about\r\ntwo feet deep and of a delicious, soft, velvety character) constantly\r\nflowing through over the smooth sand floor. They are often larger than\r\nthis, from four to five feet deep, and sometimes lined with blue and\r\nwhite tiles, which make a very clean and pretty floor. It is a great\r\nluxury in this warm climate, and many persons bathe several times a day.\r\nThe bathhouse is usually in the garden, at a convenient distance from\r\nthe house, but not immediately adjoining it. The bath was followed by an\r\nexcellent breakfast, after which we drove through the city. Ceará is a\r\nwonderfully progressive town for Brazil. Five years ago it had not a\r\npaved street; now all the streets are well paved, with good sidewalks,\r\nand the city is very carefully laid out, with a view to its future\r\ngrowth.[44] To-day we are again coasting along within sight of land,\r\nwith a quiet sea and a delicious breeze. The ocean is covered with white\r\ncaps, and of a very peculiar greenish, aquamarine tint, the same which I\r\nobserved as soon as we reached these latitudes in coming out. This\r\nsingular color is said to be owing to the nature of the sea bottom and\r\nthe shallowness of the water, combined, farther north, with the\r\nadmixture of fresh water along the coast.\r\n\r\n_August 6th._—Arrived early this morning before Maranham, and went on\r\nshore to breakfast at the hotel; for, wonderful to relate, Maranham\r\npossesses a hotel, a great rarity in many Brazilian towns. We passed the\r\ngreater part of the day in driving about the city with Dr. Braga, who\r\nkindly undertook to show us everything of interest.[45] The town and\r\nharbor are very pretty, the city itself standing on an island, formed by\r\ntwo bays running up on either side and enclosing it. The surrounding\r\ncountry is flat and very thickly wooded, though the woods are rather\r\nlow. Here, at the house of Dr. Braga’s brother-in-law, we saw, for the\r\nfirst time, the slender, graceful Assai palm, from which the drink is\r\nmade so much appreciated in Pará and on the Lower Amazons. It is curious\r\nto see the negroes go up the tree to gather the fruit. The trunk is\r\nperfectly smooth, the fruit growing in a heavy cluster of berries, just\r\nbelow the crown of leaves on its summit. The negro fastens a cord or a\r\nstrip of palm-leaf around his insteps, thus binding his feet together\r\nthat they may not slide apart on the smooth stem, and by means of this\r\nkind of stirrup he contrives to cling to the slippery trunk and scramble\r\nup.\r\n\r\nWe were much interested in seeing here an admirably well conducted\r\ninstitution for the education of poor orphans. Its chief aim is to\r\neducate them, not as scholars, though they receive elementary\r\ninstruction in reading, writing, and ciphering, but to teach them a\r\nvariety of occupations by which they can earn an honest livelihood. They\r\nare trained in several trades, are taught to play on a number of\r\ninstruments, and there is also a school of design connected with the\r\nestablishment. A faultless order and scrupulous neatness prevailed\r\nthrough the whole building, which was not the result of an exceptional\r\npreparation, since our visit was wholly unexpected. This surprised us\r\nthe more, because, notwithstanding their fondness for bathing, order and\r\nneatness in their houses are not a virtue among the Brazilians. This may\r\nbe owing to slave labor,—rarely anything better than eye-service. The\r\nlarge dormitories looked fresh and airy, with the hammocks rolled up and\r\nlaid on a shelf, each one above the peg to which it belonged; the shoes\r\nwere hung on nails along the walls, and the little trunks, holding the\r\nclothing of each scholar, were neatly arranged beneath them. On the\r\nupper story was the hospital, a large, well-ventilated room, with\r\nnumerous windows commanding beautiful views, and a cool breeze blowing\r\nthrough it. Here were cots instead of hammocks, but I thought the sick\r\nboys might prefer the swinging, cradle-like beds to which they were\r\naccustomed, and which they evidently find very comfortable. When Mr.\r\nAgassiz remarked, as we passed through the dormitory, that sleeping in a\r\nhammock was an experience he had yet to make, one of the boys took his\r\ndown from the shelf, and, hanging it up, laughingly threw himself into\r\nit, with a lazy ease which looked quite enviable. The kitchen and\r\ngrocery rooms were as neat as the rest of the house, and the simplicity\r\nof the whole establishment, while it admitted everything necessary for\r\ncomfort and health, was well adapted for its objects. A pretty little\r\nchapel adjoined the house, and the house itself was built around an open\r\nsquare planted with trees,—a pleasant playground for the boys, who have\r\ntheir music there in the evening. On our return to town we heard that,\r\nowing to the breakage of some part of the machinery, the steamer would\r\nbe detained in this port for a couple of days. We have, however,\r\nreturned to our quarters on board, preferring to spend the night on the\r\nwater rather than in the hot, close town.\r\n\r\n_August 7th._—To-day we have all been interested in watching the\r\nbeautiful Medusæ swept along by the tide, so close to the side of the\r\nsteamer that they could easily be reached from the stairway. We have now\r\nquite a number disposed about the deck in buckets and basins, and Mr.\r\nBurkhardt is making colored sketches of them. They are very beautiful,\r\nand quite new to Mr. Agassiz. In some the disk has a brown tracery like\r\nseaweed over it, while its edge is deeply lobed, every lobe being tinged\r\nwith an intensely brilliant dark blue; the lobes are divided into eight\r\nsets of four each, making thirty-two in all, and an eye is placed on the\r\nmargin between each set; the tubes running to the eyes are much larger\r\nthan those in the intervals between, and the network of vessels on the\r\nmargin is wonderfully fine and delicate; the curtains hanging from the\r\nmouth are white and closely fringed with full flounces, somewhat like\r\nour Aurelia. The movement is quick, the margin of the disk beating with\r\nshort, rapid pants. Another is altogether brown and white, the\r\nseaweed-like pattern being carried down to the edge of the lobes, and\r\nthe lobes themselves being more delicate than those of the blue-edged\r\none, the disk thinning out greatly towards the periphery. The brown\r\nmarks are, however, darker, more distinct, and cover a larger space in\r\nsome specimens than in others. This is also true of those with the blue\r\nmargin, the brown pattern covering the whole disk in some, confined to a\r\nsimple zone around the disk in others, and even entirely absent\r\noccasionally. Mr. Agassiz inclines to think, from the similarity of\r\ntheir other features, however, that, notwithstanding their difference of\r\ncolor, they all belong to the same species, the variety in coloration\r\nbeing probably connected with difference of sex. He has, at any rate,\r\nascertained that all the wholly brown specimens caught to-day are males.\r\n\r\nWe were rejoiced this morning by the sight of our own flag coming into\r\nharbor. We presently found that the ship was the gunboat Nipsic. She had\r\nsailed from Boston on the 4th of July, and brought papers of a later\r\ndate than any we have seen. The officers were kind enough to send us a\r\nlarge bundle of papers, which we have been eagerly devouring.\r\n\r\n_August 8th._—Another quite new and beautiful Medusa to-day. As we were\r\nwaiting for breakfast this morning a number floated past, so dark in\r\ncolor that in the water they appeared almost black. Two of our party\r\ntook a boat and went in search of them, but the tide was so swift that\r\nthey swept past like lightning, and one had hardly time to point them\r\nout before they were gone again. However, after many efforts, we\r\nsucceeded in getting one, whose portrait Mr. Burkhardt is now taking.\r\nThe disk is of a chocolate-brown, shading into a darker, more velvety\r\nhue toward the edge, which is slightly scalloped, but not cut up into\r\ndeep lobes like those of yesterday. The eyes, eight in number, are\r\ndistinctly visible as lighter-colored specks on the margin. The\r\nappendages hanging from the mouth are more solid and not so thickly\r\nfringed as in those of yesterday. It moves rather slowly in its glass\r\nprison, the broad margin shading from lighter brown to a soft chocolate\r\ncolor almost verging on black, as it flaps up and down somewhat\r\nlanguidly, but still with a regular, steady pulsation.[46]\r\n\r\n_August 9th._—We passed yesterday afternoon with the Braga family in\r\ntown. The weather was charming, a cool breeze blowing through the\r\nveranda where we dined. There were a number of guests to meet us, and we\r\nhad again cause to acknowledge how completely the stranger is made to\r\nfeel himself at home among these hospitable people. We sailed this\r\nmorning, Mr. Agassiz taking with him a valuable collection, though our\r\ntime was so short. The fact is, that, not only here, but at every town\r\nwhere we have stopped in coming up the coast, the ready, cordial desire\r\nof the people to help in the work has enabled him to get together\r\ncollections which it would otherwise have been impossible to make in so\r\nshort a time. If he is unexpectedly successful in this expedition, it is\r\nas much owing to the active sympathy of the Brazilians themselves, and\r\nto their interest in the objects he has so much at heart, as to the\r\nefforts of himself and his companions.\r\n\r\n_August 11th._—Pará. Early yesterday morning, a few yellowish patches\r\nstaining the ocean here and there gave us our first glimpse of the water\r\nof the Amazons. Presently the patches became broad streaks, the fresh\r\nwaters encroaching gradually upon the sea, until, at about ten o’clock,\r\nwe fairly entered the mouth of the river, though, as the shores are some\r\nhundred and fifty miles apart, we might have believed ourselves on the\r\nbroad ocean. As we neared the city, the numerous islands closing up\r\nabout Pará and sheltering its harbor limited the view and broke the\r\nenormous expanse of the fresh-water basin. We anchored off the city at\r\nabout three o’clock, but a heavy thundershower, with violent rain,\r\nprevented us from going on shore till the next morning. None of the\r\nparty landed except Major Coutinho. He went to announce our arrival to\r\nhis friend, Mr. Pimenta Bueno, who has kindly invited us to make his\r\nhouse our home while we stay in Pará. The next morning was beautiful\r\nafter the rain, and at seven o’clock two boats were sent to take us and\r\nour effects on shore. On landing we went at once to Mr. Pimenta’s large\r\nbusiness establishment near the wharves. Here he has provided several\r\nexcellent working-rooms to serve as laboratories and storage-places for\r\nthe specimens, and besides these a number of airy, cool chambers on the\r\nfloor above, for the accommodation of our companions, who have already\r\nslung their hammocks, arranged their effects, and are keeping a kind of\r\nbachelor’s hall. Having disposed of the scientific apparatus, we drove\r\nout to Mr. Pimenta’s “chacara,” some two miles out of town, on the Rua\r\nde Nazareth, where we were received with the utmost kindness. Mr.\r\nAgassiz and Major Coutinho soon returned to town, where no time is to be\r\nlost in beginning work at the laboratory. I remained at home and passed\r\na pleasant morning with the ladies of the family, who made me acquainted\r\nwith the peculiar beverage so famous in these regions, prepared from the\r\nberries of the Assai palm. They are about the size of cranberries, and\r\nof a dark-brown color. Being boiled and crushed they yield a quantity of\r\njuice, which when strained has about the consistency of chocolate, and\r\nis of a dark purplish tint like blackberry juice. It has a sweetish\r\ntaste, and is very nice eaten with sugar and the crisp “farinha d’agua,”\r\na kind of coarse flour made from the mandioca root. People of all\r\nclasses throughout the province of Pará are exceedingly fond of this\r\nbeverage, and in the city they have a proverb which runs thus:—\r\n\r\n                   “Who visits Pará is glad to stay,\r\n                   Who drinks Assai goes never away.”\r\n\r\n_August 12th._—This morning we rose early and walked into town. Great\r\npains have been taken with the environs of Pará, and the Rua de Nazareth\r\nis one of the broad streets leading into the country, and planted with\r\nlarge trees (chiefly mangueiras) for two or three miles out of town. On\r\nour way we saw a lofty palm-tree completely overpowered and stifled in\r\nthe embrace of an enormous parasite. So luxuriant is the growth of the\r\nlatter that you do not perceive, till it is pointed out to you, that its\r\nspreading branches and thick foliage completely hide the tree from which\r\nit derives its life; only from the extreme summit a few fan-like\r\npalm-leaves shoot upwards as if trying to escape into the air and light.\r\nThe palm cannot long survive, however, and with its death it seals the\r\ndoom of its murderer also. There is another evidence, and a more\r\npleasing one, of the luxuriance of nature on this same road. The\r\nskeleton of a house stands by the wayside; whether a ruin or unfinished,\r\nI am unable to say, but at all events only the walls are standing, with\r\nthe openings for doors and windows. Nature has completed this imperfect\r\ndwelling;—she has covered it over with a green roof, she has planted the\r\nempty enclosure with a garden of her own choosing, she has trained vines\r\naround the open doors and windows; and the deserted house, if it has no\r\nother inmates, is at least a home for the birds. It makes a very pretty\r\npicture. I never pass it without wishing for a sketch of it. On our\r\narrival in town we went at once to the market. It is very near the\r\nwater, and we were much amused in watching the Indian canoes at the\r\nlanding. The “montaria,” as the Indian calls his canoe, is a long,\r\nnarrow boat, covered at one end with a thatched roof, under which is the\r\nliving-room of the family. Here the Indian has his home; wife and\r\nchildren, hammock, cooking utensils,—all his household goods, in fact.\r\nIn some of the boats the women were preparing breakfast, cooking the\r\ncoffee or the tapioca over a pan of coals. In others they were selling\r\nthe coarse pottery, which they make into all kinds of utensils,\r\nsometimes of quite graceful, pretty forms. We afterwards went through\r\nthe market. It is quite large and neatly kept; but the Brazilian markets\r\nare only good as compared with each other. The meats are generally poor;\r\nthere is little game to be seen; they have no variety of vegetables,\r\nwhich might be so easily cultivated here, and even the display of fruit\r\nin the market is by no means what one would expect it to be. To-night\r\nMr. Agassiz goes off with a party of gentlemen on an excursion to some\r\nof the islands in the harbor. This first expedition in the neighborhood\r\nof Pará, from which the Professor promises himself much pleasure, is\r\nplanned by Dr. Couto de Magalhaês, President of the Province.[47]\r\n\r\n_August 14th._—We are very agreeably surprised in the climate here. I\r\nhad expected from the moment of our arrival in the region of the Amazons\r\nto be gasping in a fierce, unintermitting, intolerable heat. On the\r\ncontrary, the mornings are fresh; a walk or ride between six and eight\r\no’clock is always delightful; and though during the middle of the day\r\nthe heat is certainly very great, it cools off again towards four\r\no’clock; the evenings are delightful, and the nights always comfortable.\r\nEven in the hottest part of the day the heat is not dead; there is\r\nalways a breeze stirring. Mr. Agassiz returned this afternoon from his\r\nexcursion in the harbor, more deeply impressed than ever with the\r\ngrandeur of this entrance to the Amazons and the beauty of its many\r\nislands, “An archipelago of islands,” as he says, “in an ocean of fresh\r\nwater.” He describes the mode of fishing of the Indians as curious. They\r\nrow very softly up the creek, having first fastened the seine across\r\nfrom shore to shore at a lower point, and when they have gained a\r\ncertain distance above it, they spring into the water with a great plash\r\nand rush down the creek in a line, driving the fish before them into the\r\nnet. One draught alone filled the boat half full of fish. Mr. Agassiz\r\nwas especially interested in seeing alive for the first time the curious\r\nfish called “Tralhote” by the Indians, and known to naturalists as the\r\nAnableps tetrophthalmus. This name, signifying “four-eyed,” is derived\r\nfrom the singular structure of the eye. A membranous fold enclosing the\r\nbulb of the eye stretches across the pupil, dividing the visual\r\napparatus into an upper and lower half. No doubt this formation is\r\nintended to suit the peculiar habits of the Anableps. These fishes\r\ngather in shoals on the surface of the water, their heads resting partly\r\nabove, partly below the surface, and they move by a leaping motion\r\nsomewhat like that of frogs on land. Thus, half in air, half in water,\r\nthey require eyes adapted for seeing in both elements, and the\r\narrangement described above just meets this want.\r\n\r\n_August 19th._—To-night at ten o’clock we go on board the steamer, and\r\nbefore dawn shall be on our way up the river. This has been a delicious\r\nweek of rest and refreshment to me. The quiet country life, with morning\r\nwalks in the fresh, fragrant lanes and roads immediately about us, has\r\nbeen very soothing after four months of travel or of noisy hotel life.\r\nThe other day as we were going into town we found in the wet grass by\r\nthe roadside one of the most beautiful mushrooms I have ever seen. The\r\nstem was pure white, three or four inches in height, and about half an\r\ninch in diameter, surmounted by a club-shaped head, brown in color, with\r\na blunt point, and from the base of this head was suspended an open\r\nwhite net of exquisitely delicate texture, falling to within about an\r\ninch of the ground; a fairy web that looked fit for Queen Mab\r\nherself.[48] The week, so peaceful for me, has been one, if not of rest,\r\nat least of intense interest for Mr. Agassiz. The very day of his\r\narrival, by the kindness of our host, his working-rooms were so arranged\r\nas to make an admirable laboratory, and, from the hour he entered them,\r\nspecimens have poured in upon him from all quarters. His own party make\r\nbut a small part of the scientific corps who have worked for and with\r\nhim here. In Pará alone he has already more than fifty new species of\r\nfresh-water fishes; enough to reveal unexpected and novel relations in\r\nthe finny world, and to give the basis of an improved classification. He\r\nis far from attributing this great success wholly to his own efforts.\r\nReady as he is to work, he could not accomplish half that he does,\r\nexcept for the active good-will of those about him. Among the most\r\nvaluable of these contributions is a collection made by Mr. Pimenta\r\nBueno, of the so-called fishes of the forest. When the waters overflow\r\nafter the rainy season and fill the forest for a considerable distance\r\non either side, these fish hover over the depressions and hollows, and\r\nas the waters subside are left in the pools and channels. They do not\r\noccur in the open river, but are always found in these forest retreats,\r\nand go by the name of the “Peixe do Mato.”\r\n\r\nMr. Agassiz has not only to acknowledge the untiring kindness of\r\nindividuals here, but also the cordial expression of sympathy from\r\npublic bodies in the objects of the expedition. A committee from the\r\nmunicipality of the city has waited upon him to express the general\r\nsatisfaction in the undertaking, and he has received a public\r\ndemonstration of the same kind from the college. The bishop of the\r\nprovince and his coadjutor have also been most cordial in offers of\r\nassistance. Nor does the interest thus expressed evaporate in empty\r\nwords. Mr. Pimenta Bueno is director of the Brazilian line of steamers\r\nfrom Pará to Tabatinga.[49] The trip to Manaos, at the mouth of the Rio\r\nNegro, is generally made in five days, allowing only for stoppages of an\r\nhour or two at different stations, to take or leave passengers and to\r\ndeposit or receive merchandise. In order that we may be perfectly\r\nindependent, however, and stop wherever it seems desirable to make\r\ncollections, the company places at our disposition a steamer for one\r\nmonth between Pará and Manaos. There are to be no passengers but\r\nourselves, and the steamer is provided with everything necessary for the\r\nwhole company during that period,—food, service, &c. I think it may\r\nfairly be said that in no part of the world could a private scientific\r\nundertaking be greeted with more cordiality or receive a more liberal\r\nhospitality than has been accorded to the present expedition. I dwell\r\nupon these things and recur to them often, not in any spirit of egotism,\r\nbut because it is due to the character of the people from whom they come\r\nto make the fullest acknowledgment of their generosity.\r\n\r\nWhile Mr. Agassiz has been busy with the zoölogical collections, Major\r\nCoutinho has been no less so in making geological, meteorological, and\r\nhydrographic investigations. His regular co-operation is invaluable, and\r\nMr. Agassiz blesses the day when their chance meeting at the Palace\r\nsuggested the idea of his joining the expedition. Not only his\r\nscientific attainments, but his knowledge of the Indian language\r\n(_lingua geral_), and his familiarity with the people, make him a most\r\nimportant coadjutor. With his aid Mr. Agassiz has already opened a sort\r\nof scientific log-book, in which, by the side of the scientific name of\r\nevery specimen entered by the Professor, Major Coutinho records its\r\npopular local name, obtained from the Indians, with all they can tell of\r\nits haunts and habits.\r\n\r\nI have said nothing of Mr. Agassiz’s observations on the character of\r\nthe soil since we left Rio, thinking it best to give them as a whole.\r\nAlong the entire length of the coast he has followed the drift,\r\nexamining it carefully at every station. At Bahia it contained fewer\r\nlarge boulders than in Rio, but was full of small pebbles, and rested\r\nupon undecomposed stratified rock. At Maceió, the capital of the\r\nprovince of Alagôas, it was the same, but resting upon decomposed rock,\r\nas at Tijuca. Below this was a bed of stratified clay, containing small\r\npebbles. In Pernambuco, on our drive to the great aqueduct, we followed\r\nit for the whole way; the same red clayey homogeneous paste, resting\r\nthere on decomposed rock. The line of contact at Monteiro, the aqueduct\r\nstation, was very clearly marked, however, by an intervening bed of\r\npebbles. At Parahyba do Norte the same sheet of drift, but containing\r\nmore and larger pebbles, rests above a decomposed sandstone somewhat\r\nresembling the decomposed rock of Pernambuco. In the undecomposed rock\r\nbelow, Mr. Agassiz found some fossil shells. In the neighborhood of Cape\r\nSt. Roque we came upon sand-dunes resembling those of Cape Cod, and\r\nwherever we sailed near enough to the shore to see the banks distinctly,\r\nas was frequently the case, the bed of drift below the shifting\r\nsuperficial sands above was distinctly noticeable. The difference in\r\ncolor between the white sand and the reddish soil beneath made it easy\r\nto perceive their relations. At Ceará, where we landed, Mr. Agassiz had\r\nan opportunity of satisfying himself of this by closer examination. At\r\nMaranham the drift is everywhere conspicuous, and at Pará equally so.\r\nThis sheet of drift which he has thus followed from Rio de Janeiro to\r\nthe mouth of the Amazons is everywhere of the same geological\r\nconstitution. It is always a homogeneous clayey paste of a reddish\r\ncolor, containing quartz pebbles; and, whatever be the character of the\r\nrock in place, whether granite, sandstone, gneiss, or lime, the\r\ncharacter of the drift never changes or partakes of that of the rocks\r\nwith which it is in contact. This certainly proves that, whatever be its\r\norigin, it cannot be referred to the localities where it is now found,\r\nbut must have been brought from a distance. Whoever shall track it back\r\nto the place where this peculiar red soil with its constituent elements\r\nforms the primitive rock, will have solved the problem. I introduce here\r\na letter written by Mr. Agassiz, a few days later, to the Emperor, which\r\nwill better give his views on the subject.\r\n\r\n                                    A BORD DE L’ICAMIABA, SUR L’AMAZONE,\r\n                                             le 20 Aout, 1865.\r\n\r\nSIRE:—Permettez moi de rendre un compte rapide à Votre Majesté, de ce\r\nque j’ai observé de plus intéressant depuis mon départ de Rio. La\r\npremière chose qui m’a frappé en arrivant à Bahia, ce fut d’y trouver le\r\nterrain erratique, comme à la Tijuca et comme dans la partie méridionale\r\nde Minas, que j’ai visitée. Ici comme là, ce terrain, d’une constitution\r\nidentique, repose sur les roches en place les plus diversifiées. Je l’ai\r\nretrouvé de même à Maceio, à Pernambuco, à Parahyba do Norte, à Ceará, à\r\nMaranham, et au Pará. Voilà donc un fait établi sur la plus grande\r\néchelle! Cela démontre que les matériaux superficiels, que l’on pourrait\r\ndésigner du nom de drift, ici comme dans le Nord de l’Europe et de\r\nl’Amérique, ne sauraient être le résultat de la décomposition des roches\r\nsous-jacentes, puisque celles-ci sont tantôt du granit, tantôt du\r\ngneiss, tantôt du schiste micacé ou talqueux, tantôt du grès, tandis que\r\nle drift offre partout la même composition. Je n’en suis pas moins aussi\r\néloigné que jamais de pouvoir signaler l’origine de ces matériaux et la\r\ndirection de leur transport. Aujourd’hui que le Major Coutinho a appris\r\nà distinguer le drift des roches décomposées, il m’assure que nous le\r\nretrouverons dans toute la vallée de l’Amazône. L’imagination la plus\r\nhardie recule devant toute espèce de généralisation à ce sujet. Et\r\npourtant, il faudra bien en venir à se familiariser avec l’idée que la\r\ncause qui a dispersé ces matériaux, quelle qu’elle soit, a agi sur la\r\nplus grande échelle, puisqu’on les retrouvera probablement sur tout le\r\ncontinent. Déjà j’apprends que mes jeunes compagnons de voyage ont\r\nobservé le drift dans les environs de Barbacena et d’Ouro-Preto et dans\r\nla vallée du Rio das Velhas. Mes résultats zoologiques ne sont pas moins\r\nsatisfaisants; et pour ne parler que des poissons, j’ai trouvé à Pará\r\nseulement, pendant une semaine, plus d’espèces qu’on n’en a décrit\r\njusqu’à présent de tout le bassin de l’Amazône; c. à. d. en tout\r\nsoixante-trois. Cette étude sera, je crois, utile à l’ichthyologie, car\r\nj’ai déjà pu distinguer cinq familles nouvelles et dix-huit genres\r\nnouveaux et les espèces inédites ne s’élèvent pas à moins de\r\nquarante-neuf. C’est une garantie que je ferai encore une riche moisson,\r\nlorsque j’entrerai dans le domaine de l’Amazône proprement dit; car je\r\nn’ai encore vu qu’un dixième des espèces fluviatiles que l’on connait de\r\nce bassin et les quelques espèces marines qui remontent jusqu’au Pará.\r\nMalheureusement M. Burkhardt est malade et je n’ai encore pu faire\r\npeindre que quatre des espèces nouvelles que je me suis procurées, et\r\npuis près de la moitié n’ont été prises qu’en exemplaires uniques. Il\r\nfaut absolument qu’à mon retour je fasse un plus long séjour au Pará\r\npour remplir ces lacunes. Je suis dans le ravissement de la nature\r\ngrandiose que j’ai sous les yeux. Votre Majesté régne sans contredit sur\r\nle plus bel empire du monde et toutes personelles que soient les\r\nattentions que je reçois partout où je m’arrête, je ne puis m’empêcher\r\nde croire que n’était le caractère généreux et hospitalier des\r\nBrésiliens et l’intérêt des classes supérieures pour le progrès des\r\nsciences et de la civilisation, je n’aurais point rencontré les\r\nfacilités qui se pressent sous mes pas. C’est ainsi que pour me\r\nfaciliter l’exploration du fleuve, du Pará à Manaos, M. Pimenta Bueno,\r\nau lieu de m’acheminer par le steamer régulier, a mis à ma disposition,\r\npour un mois ou six semaines, un des plus beaux bateaux de la compagnie,\r\noù je suis instalé aussi commodément que dans mon Musée à Cambridge. M.\r\nCoutinho est plein d’attention et me rend mon travail doublement facile\r\nen le préparant à l’avance par tous les renseignements possibles.\r\n\r\nMais je ne veux pas abuser des loisirs de Votre Majesté et je la prie de\r\ncroire toujours au dévouement le plus complet et à l’affection la plus\r\nrespectueuse\r\n\r\n           De son très humble et très obéissant serviteur,\r\n\r\n                                                         L. AGASSIZ.[50]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 43:\r\n\r\n  Mr. Agassiz was indebted to Mr. Hitch for valuable additions to his\r\n  collections, and for many acts of kindness in behalf of the\r\n  expedition.\r\n\r\nFootnote 44:\r\n\r\n  Here, as elsewhere, I found ready and willing coadjutors among amateur\r\n  collectors. On my return from the Amazons, many months later, I found\r\n  collections made in my absence by Dr. Mendes and Senhor Barroso, who\r\n  had been our companions on board the steamer. At Parahyba do Norte I\r\n  was indebted in the same way to Dr. Justa. These collections will\r\n  afford invaluable materials for the comparison of the Coast Faunæ.—L.\r\n  A.\r\n\r\nFootnote 45:\r\n\r\n  At a later period I owed to Dr. Braga far more than the ordinary\r\n  courtesy extended to a stranger. I had informed him that Mr. St. John,\r\n  then following the course of the Rio San Francisco, on his way to the\r\n  province of Piauhy, would arrive in Maranham at the close of his\r\n  journey. When he reached that city he was very seriously ill with\r\n  fever. Dr. Braga took him into his house, where he was attended by him\r\n  and his family as if he had been one of their kindred. I have, indeed,\r\n  little doubt that my young friend owed his recovery to the considerate\r\n  care with which he was treated under their kindly roof.—L. A.\r\n\r\nFootnote 46:\r\n\r\n  These two Medusæ belong to the Rhizostomidæ, and I shall take an early\r\n  opportunity to publish a description of them, with the drawings of Mr.\r\n  Burkhardt.—L. A.\r\n\r\nFootnote 47:\r\n\r\n  To Dr. Couto de Magalhaês Mr. Agassiz was indebted for unremitting\r\n  attentions during our stay in the region of the Amazons. He never\r\n  failed to facilitate the success of the expedition by every means in\r\n  his power, and the large collections made under his directions during\r\n  our sojourn upon the Upper Amazons were among the most valuable\r\n  contributions to its scientific results. When he heard that Mr. Ward,\r\n  one of our young companions, was coming down the Tocantins, he sent a\r\n  boat and boatmen to meet him, and on his arrival in Pará received him\r\n  in his own house, where he remained his guest during his stay in the\r\n  city.\r\n\r\nFootnote 48:\r\n\r\n  This mushroom belongs to the genus Phallus, and seems to be an\r\n  undescribed species. I preserved it in alcohol, but was unable to have\r\n  any drawing made from it before its beauty and freshness were quite\r\n  gone. In the early morning, while the grass was still damp, we often\r\n  found a peculiar snail, a species of Bulimus, creeping by the\r\n  roadside. The form of the anterior part of the foot was unlike that of\r\n  any species known thus far from this group. Such facts show the\r\n  desirableness of making drawings from the soft parts of these animals\r\n  as well as from their solid envelopes.—L. A.\r\n\r\nFootnote 49:\r\n\r\n  The President of this line is the Baron de Mazá, esteemed by his\r\n  countrymen as a financier of great ability and a man of rare energy,\r\n  perseverance, and patriotism. As he was in Europe during the year of\r\n  my visit to Brazil, I had not the pleasure of a personal acquaintance\r\n  with him, and I therefore welcome this opportunity of thanking him for\r\n  the liberality shown in all their dealings with me by the company of\r\n  which he is the moving spirit.—L. A.\r\n\r\nFootnote 50:\r\n\r\n                                  ON BOARD THE ICAMIABA, ON THE AMAZONS,\r\n                                              August 20, 1865.\r\n\r\n  SIRE:—Allow me to give your Majesty a rapid sketch of the most\r\n  interesting facts observed by me since leaving Rio. The first thing\r\n  which struck me on arriving at Bahia was the presence of the erratic\r\n  soil, corresponding to that of Tijuca and the southern part of\r\n  Minas-Geräes, which I have visited. Here, as there, this soil,\r\n  identical in its constitution, rests upon rocks in place, of the most\r\n  diversified character. I have found it also at Maceió, at Pernambuco,\r\n  at Parahyba do Norte, at Ceará, at Maranham, and at Pará. This is a\r\n  fact, then, established on the largest scale. It shows that the\r\n  superficial materials which, here as in the North of Europe and\r\n  America, may be designated as drift, cannot be the result of the\r\n  decomposition of underlying rocks, since the latter are sometimes\r\n  granite, sometimes gneiss, sometimes mica or talcose slate, sometimes\r\n  sandstone, while the drift presents the same composition everywhere. I\r\n  am as far as ever from being able to point out the origin of these\r\n  materials and the direction of their transportation. Now that Major\r\n  Coutinho has learned to distinguish the drift from the decomposed\r\n  rocks, he assures me that we shall find it throughout the valley of\r\n  the Amazons. The boldest imagination shrinks from any generalization\r\n  on this subject, and yet we must gradually familiarize ourselves with\r\n  the idea that the cause which has dispersed these materials, whatever\r\n  it be, has acted on the largest scale, since they are probably to be\r\n  found all over the continent. Already I learn that my young travelling\r\n  companions have observed the drift in the environs of Barbacena and\r\n  Ouro-Preto, and in the valley of the Rio das Velhas. My zoölogical\r\n  results are not less satisfactory; and to speak of the fishes alone, I\r\n  have found at Pará during one week more species than have as yet been\r\n  described from the whole basin of the Amazons,—sixty-three in all.\r\n  This study will be useful, I hope, to ichthyology, for I have already\r\n  succeeded in distinguishing five new families and eighteen new genera,\r\n  while the unpublished species do not number less than forty-nine. It\r\n  is a guaranty of the rich harvest I shall make when I enter upon the\r\n  domain of the Amazons properly so called; for I have seen as yet but a\r\n  tenth part of the fluviatile species known from this basin, and some\r\n  of the marine species which come up to Pará. Unhappily, Mr. Burkhardt\r\n  is ill, and has been able to paint but four of the new species we have\r\n  procured; and of nearly half the number, only single specimens have\r\n  been secured. On my return I must make a longer stay in Pará in order\r\n  to fill these deficiencies. I am enchanted with the grandeur of nature\r\n  here. Your Majesty certainly reigns over the most beautiful empire of\r\n  the world; and, personal as are the attentions which I receive\r\n  wherever I stop, I cannot but believe that, were it not for the\r\n  generous and hospitable character of the Brazilians and the interest\r\n  of the higher classes in the progress of science and civilization, I\r\n  should not have met with the facilities which crowd my path. Thus, in\r\n  order to render the exploration of the river from Pará to Manaos more\r\n  easy, Mr. Pimenta Bueno, instead of allowing me to take the regular\r\n  steamer, has put at my disposition, for a month or six weeks, one of\r\n  the finest boats of the company, where I am installed as conveniently\r\n  as in my Museum at Cambridge. Mr. Coutinho is full of attention, and\r\n  renders my work doubly light by procuring, in advance, all the\r\n  information possible. But I will not further abuse your Majesty’s\r\n  leisure, only begging you to believe in the complete devotion and\r\n  respectful affection of\r\n\r\n                                 Your humble and obedient servant,\r\n\r\n                                                             L. AGASSIZ.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V.\r\n                          FROM PARÁ TO MANAOS.\r\n\r\n  FIRST SUNDAY ON THE AMAZONS.—GEOGRAPHICAL QUESTION.—CONVENIENT\r\n    ARRANGEMENTS OF STEAMER.—VAST DIMENSIONS OF THE\r\n    RIVER.—ASPECT OF SHORES.—VILLAGE OF BREVES.—LETTER ABOUT\r\n    COLLECTIONS.—VEGETATION.—VARIETY OF PALMS.—SETTLEMENT OF\r\n    TAJAPURÚ.—ENORMOUS SIZE OF LEAVES OF THE MIRITI PALM.—WALK\r\n    ON SHORE.—INDIAN HOUSES.—COURTESY OF INDIANS.—ROW IN THE\r\n    FOREST.—TOWN OF GURUPÁ.—RIVER XINGU.—COLOR OF WATER.—TOWN OF\r\n    PORTO DO MOZ.—FLAT-TOPPED HILLS OF ALMEYRIM.—BEAUTIFUL\r\n    SUNSET.—MONTE ALÉGRE.—CHARACTER OF SCENERY AND\r\n    SOIL.—SANTAREM.—SEND OFF PARTY ON THE RIVER\r\n    TAPAJOS.—CONTINUE UP THE AMAZONS.—PASTORAL SCENES ON THE\r\n    BANKS.—TOWN OF VILLA BELLA.—CANOE JOURNEY AT NIGHT TO THE\r\n    LAKE OF JOSÉ ASSÚ.—ESPERANÇA’S COTTAGE.—PICTURESQUE SCENE AT\r\n    NIGHT.—SUCCESS IN COLLECTING.—INDIAN LIFE.—MAKING\r\n    FARINHA.—DANCE IN THE EVENING.—HOWLING MONKEYS.—RELIGIOUS\r\n    IMPRESSIONS OF INDIANS.—COTTAGE OF MAIA THE FISHERMAN.—HIS\r\n    INTEREST IN EDUCATING HIS CHILDREN.—RETURN TO\r\n    STEAMER.—SCIENTIFIC RESULTS OF THE EXCURSION.\r\n\r\n\r\n_August 20th._—On board the “Icamiaba.” Our first Sunday on the Amazons;\r\nfor, notwithstanding the warm dispute as to whether both the rivers\r\nenclosing the island of Marajó must be considered as parts of the great\r\nriver, it is impossible not to feel from the moment you leave Pará that\r\nyou have entered upon the Amazons. Geology must settle this knotty\r\nquestion. If it should be seen that the continent once presented an\r\nunbroken line, as Mr. Agassiz believes, from Cape St. Roque to Cayenne,\r\nthe sea having encroached upon it so as to give it its present limits,\r\nthe Amazons must originally have entered the ocean far to the east of\r\nits present mouth, at a time when the Island of Marajó divided the river\r\nin two channels flowing on either side of it and uniting again beyond\r\nit. We came on board last night, accompanied to the boat by a number of\r\nthe friends who have made our sojourn in Pará so agreeable, and who came\r\noff to bid us farewell. Thus far the hardships of this South American\r\njourney seem to retreat at our approach. It is impossible to travel with\r\ngreater comfort than surrounds us here. My own suite of rooms consists\r\nof a good-sized state-room, with dressing-room and bath-room adjoining,\r\nand, if the others are not quite so luxuriously accommodated, they have\r\nspace enough. The state-rooms are hardly used at night, for a hammock on\r\ndeck is far more comfortable in this climate. Our deck, roofed in for\r\nits whole length, and with an awning to let down on the sides, if\r\nneeded, looks like a comfortable, unceremonious sitting-room. A table\r\ndown the middle serving as a dinner-table, but which is at this moment\r\nstrewn with maps, journals, books, and papers of all sorts, two or three\r\nlounging-chairs, a number of camp-stools, and half a dozen hammocks, in\r\none or two of which some of the party are taking their ease, furnish our\r\ndrawing-room, and supply all that is needed for work and rest. At one\r\nend is also a drawing-table for Mr. Burkhardt, beside a number of kegs\r\nand glass jars for specimens. This first day, however, it is almost\r\nimpossible to do more than look and wonder. Mr. Agassiz says: “This\r\nriver is not like a river; the general current in such a sea of fresh\r\nwater is hardly perceptible to the sight, and seems more like the flow\r\nof an ocean than like that of an inland stream.” It is true we are\r\nconstantly between shores, but they are shores, not of the river itself,\r\nbut of the countless islands scattered throughout its enormous breadth.\r\nAs we coast along their banks, it is delightful to watch the exquisite\r\nvegetation with which we have yet to become familiar. The tree which\r\nmost immediately strikes the eye, and stands out from the mass of green\r\nwith wonderful grace and majesty, is the lofty, slender Assai palm, with\r\nits crown of light plume-like leaves, and its bunches of berry-like\r\nfruit, hanging from a branch that shoots out almost horizontally, just\r\nbelow the leaves. Houses on the shore break the solitude here and there.\r\nFrom this distance they look picturesque, with thatched, overhanging\r\nroofs, covering a kind of open porch. Just now we passed a cleared nook\r\nat the water-side, where a wooden cross marked a single mound. What a\r\nlonely grave it seemed! We are now coasting along the Isle of Marajó,\r\nkeeping up the so-called Pará river; we shall not enter the undisputed\r\nwaters of the Amazons till the day after to-morrow. This part of the\r\nriver goes also by the name of the Bay of Marajó.\r\n\r\n_August 21st._—Last evening we stopped at our first station,—the little\r\ntown of Breves. Its population, like that of all these small settlements\r\non the Lower Amazons, is made up of an amalgamation of races. You see\r\nthe regular features and fair skin of the white man combined with the\r\nblack, coarse, straight hair of the Indian, or the mulatto with partly\r\nnegro, partly Indian features, but the crisp taken out of the hair; and\r\nwith these combinations comes in the pure Indian type, with its low\r\nbrow, square build of face, and straight line of the shoulders. In the\r\nwomen especially the shoulders are rather high. In the first house we\r\nentered there was only an old half-breed Indian-woman, standing in the\r\nbroad open porch of her thatched home, where she seemed to be surrounded\r\nwith live stock,—parrots and parroquets of all sorts and sizes, which\r\nshe kept for sale. After looking in at several of the houses, buying one\r\nor two monkeys, some parroquets, and some articles of the village\r\npottery, as ugly, I must say, as they were curious, we wandered up into\r\nthe forest to gather plants for drying. The palms are more abundant,\r\nlarger, and in greater variety than we have seen them hitherto. At dusk\r\nwe returned to the steamer, where we found a crowd of little boys and\r\nsome older members of the village population, with snakes, fishes,\r\ninsects, monkeys, &c. The news had spread that the collecting of “bixos”\r\nwas the object of this visit to their settlement, and all were thronging\r\nin with their live wares of different kinds. Mr. Agassiz was very much\r\npleased with this first harvest. He added a considerable number of new\r\nspecies to his collection of Amazonian fishes made in Pará, already so\r\nfull and rare. We remained at the Breves landing all night, and this\r\nmorning we are steaming along between islands, in a channel which bears\r\nthe name of the river Aturia. It gives an idea of the grandeur of the\r\nAmazons, that many of the channels dividing the islands by which its\r\nimmense breadth is broken are themselves like ample rivers, and among\r\nthe people here are known by distinct local names. The banks are flat;\r\nwe have seen no cliffs as yet, and the beauty of the scenery is wholly\r\nin the forest. I speak more of the palms than of other trees, because\r\nthey are not to be mistaken, and from their peculiar port they stand out\r\nin bold relief from the mass of foliage, often rising above it and\r\nsharply defined against the sky. There are, however, a host of other\r\ntrees, the names of which are unknown to us as yet, many of which I\r\nsuppose have no place even in botanical nomenclature, forming a dense\r\nwall of verdure along the banks of the river. We have sometimes heard it\r\nsaid that the voyage up the Amazons is monotonous; but to me it seems\r\ndelightful to coast along by these woods, of a character so new to us,\r\nto get glimpses into their dark depths or into a cleared spot with a\r\nsingle stately palm here and there, or to catch even the merest glance\r\nat the life of the people who live in the isolated settlements,\r\nconsisting only of one or two Indian houses by the river-side. We are\r\nkeeping so near to the banks to-day, that we can almost count the leaves\r\non the trees, and have an excellent opportunity of studying the various\r\nkinds of palms. At first the Assai was most conspicuous, but now come in\r\na number of others. The Mirití (Mauritia) is one of the most beautiful,\r\nwith its pendant clusters of reddish fruit and its enormous, spreading,\r\nfan-like leaves cut into ribbons, one of which Wallace says is a load\r\nfor a man. The Jupatí (Rhaphia), with its plume-like leaves, sometimes\r\nfrom forty to fifty feet in length, seems, in consequence of its short\r\nstem, to start almost from the ground. Its vase-like form is peculiarly\r\ngraceful and symmetrical. Then there is the Bussù (Manicaria), with\r\nstiff, entire leaves, some thirty feet in length, more upright and close\r\nin their mode of growth, and serrated along their edges. The stem of\r\nthis palm also is comparatively short. The banks in this part of the\r\nriver are very generally bordered by two plants forming sometimes a sort\r\nof hedge along the shore; namely, the Aninga (Arum), with large,\r\nheart-shaped leaves on the summit of tall stems, and the Murici, a lower\r\ngrowth, just on the water’s edge. We are passing out of the so-called\r\nriver Aturia into another channel of like character, the river Tajapurú.\r\nIn the course of the day we shall arrive at a little settlement bearing\r\nthe same name, where is to be our second station.\r\n\r\n_August 22d._—Yesterday we passed the day at the settlement mentioned\r\nabove. It consists only of the house of a Brazilian merchant,[51] who\r\nlives here with his family, having no neighbors except the inhabitants\r\nof a few Indian houses in the forest immediately about. One wonders at\r\nfirst what should induce a man to isolate himself in this solitude. But\r\nthe India-rubber trade is very productive here. The Indians tap the\r\ntrees as we tap our sugar-maples, and give the produce in exchange for\r\nvarious articles of their own domestic consumption. Our day at Tajapurú\r\nwas a very successful one in a scientific point of view, and the\r\ncollections were again increased by a number of new species. Much as has\r\nbeen said of the number and variety of fishes in the Amazons, the fauna\r\nseems far richer than it has been reported. For those of my readers who\r\ncare to follow the scientific progress of the expedition as well as the\r\nthread of personal adventure, I add here a letter on the subject,\r\nwritten a day or two later by Mr. Agassiz to Mr. Pimenta Bueno, in Pará,\r\nthe generous friend to whom he owes in a great degree the facilities he\r\nenjoys in this voyage.\r\n\r\n                          22 Aout, au matin: entre Tajapurú et Gurupá.\r\n\r\n  MON CHER AMI:—La journée d’hier a été des plus instructives, surtout\r\n  pour les poissons “do Mato.” Nous avons obtenu quinze espèces en\r\n  tout. Sur ce nombre il y en a dix nouvelles, quatre qui se trouvent\r\n  aussi au Pará et une déjà décrite par moi dans le voyage de Spix et\r\n  Martius; mais ce qu’il y a de plus intéressant, c’est la preuve que\r\n  fournissent ces espèces, à les prendre dans leur totalité, que\r\n  l’ensemble des poissons qui habitent les eaux à l’ouest du groupe\r\n  d’îles qu’on appelle Marajó, diffère de ceux des eaux du Rio do\r\n  Pará. La liste des noms que nous avons demandée aux Indiens prouve\r\n  encore que le nombre des espèces qui se trouvent dans ces localités\r\n  est beaucoup plus considérable que celui des espèces que nous avons\r\n  pu nous procurer; aussi avons nous laissé des bocaux à Breves et à\r\n  Tajapurú pour compléter la collection.\r\n\r\n  Voici quelques remarques qui vous feront mieux apprécier ces\r\n  différences, si vous voulez les comparer avec le catalogue des\r\n  espèces du Pará que je vous ai laissé. À tout prendre, il me parait\r\n  évident dès à présent que notre voyage fera une révolution dans\r\n  l’Ichthyologie. Et d’abord, le Jacundá de Tajapurú est différent des\r\n  espèces du Pará; de même l’Acará; puis nous avons une espèce\r\n  nouvelle de Sarapó et une espèce nouvelle de Jeju; une espèce\r\n  nouvelle de Rabeca, une espèce nouvelle d’Anojá, un genre nouveau de\r\n  Candiru, un genre nouveau de Bagre, un genre nouveau d’Acary et une\r\n  espèce nouvelle d’Acary du même genre que celui du Pará; plus une\r\n  espèce nouvelle de Matupirim. Ajoutez à ceci une espèce d’Aracu déjà\r\n  décrite, mais qui ne se trouve pas au Pará et vous aurez à Tajapurú\r\n  onze espèces qui n’existent pas au Pará, auxquelles il faut ajouter\r\n  encore quatre espèces qui se trouvent à Tajapurú aussi bien qu’au\r\n  Pará, et une qui se trouve au Pará, à Brèves, et à Tajapurú. En tout\r\n  vingt espèces, dont quinze nouvelles, en deux jours. Malheureusement\r\n  les Indiens ont mal compris nos directions, et ne nous ont rapporté\r\n  qu’un seul exemplaire de chacune de ces espèces. Il reste donc\r\n  beaucoup à faire dans ces localités, surtout à en juger d’après le\r\n  catalogue des noms recueillis par le Major Coutinho qui renferme\r\n  vingt-six espèces “do Mato” et quarante-six “do Rio.” Il nous en\r\n  manque donc au moins cinquante-deux de Tajapurú, même à supposer que\r\n  cette localité renferme aussi les cinq espèces de Breves. Vous voyez\r\n  que nous laisserons encore énormément à faire à nos successeurs.\r\n\r\n  Adieu pour aujourd’hui, votre bien affectioné\r\n\r\n                                                       L. AGASSIZ.[52]\r\n\r\nThe Indians here are very skilful in fishing, and instead of going to\r\ncollect, Mr. Agassiz, immediately on arriving at any station, sends off\r\nseveral fishermen of the place, remaining himself on board to\r\nsuperintend the drawing and putting up of the specimens as they\r\narrive.[53] He made at Tajapurú a collection of the leaves and fruit of\r\npalms, of which there were several very beautiful ones near the shore. I\r\nsat for a long time on the deck watching an Indian cutting a leaf from a\r\nMirití palm. He was sitting in the crotch of a single leaf, as safe and\r\nas perfectly supported as if he had been on the branch of an oak-tree,\r\nand it took many blows of his heavy axe to separate the leaf at his side\r\nwhich he was trying to bring down. The heat during the day was intense,\r\nbut at about five o’clock it became quite cool and R—— and I strolled on\r\nshore. Walking here is a peculiar process, and seems rather alarming\r\ntill you become accustomed to it. A great part of the land, even far up\r\ninto the forest, is overflowed, and single logs are thrown across the\r\nstreams and pools, over which the inhabitants walk with as much security\r\nas on a broad road, but which seem anything but safe to the new-comer.\r\nAfter we had gone a little way we came to an Indian house on the border\r\nof the wood. Here we were very cordially invited to enter, and had again\r\ncause to comment on the tidy aspect of the porch, which is their general\r\nreception-room. A description of one of these dwellings will do for all.\r\nTheir materials are drawn from the forest about them. The frames are\r\nmade of tall, slender tree-trunks, crossing each other at right angles.\r\nBetween these are woven long palm-leaves, making an admirable thatch, or\r\nsometimes the walls are filled in with mud. The roof overhangs, covering\r\nthe wide, open porch, which extends the length of one side of the house,\r\nand is as deep as a good-sized room; it is usually left open on the\r\nsides as well as in front. Within, the rest of the house is divided off\r\ninto one or more chambers, according to its size. I have not penetrated\r\ninto these, but can bear testimony to the usual cleanliness and order of\r\nthe outer room. The hard mud-floor is neatly swept, there is no litter\r\nabout, and, except for the mosquitoes, I should think it no hardship to\r\nsling my hammock for the night under the thatched roof of one of these\r\nprimitive veranda-like apartments. There is one element of dirt common\r\nin the houses of our own poor which is absent here. Instead of the mass\r\nof old musty bedding, a nest for vermin, the Indians have their cool\r\nhammocks, slung from side to side of the room. One feature in their mode\r\nof building deserves to be mentioned. Owing to the submerged state of\r\nthe ground on which they live, the Indians often raise their houses on\r\npiles sunk in the water. Here we have the old lacustrine buildings, so\r\nmuch discussed of late years, reproduced for us. One even sees sometimes\r\na little garden lifted in this way above the water.\r\n\r\nBut to return to our walk. One of the Indians invited us to continue our\r\nramble to his house, which he said was not far beyond, in the forest. We\r\nreadily complied, for the path he pointed out to us looked tempting in\r\nthe extreme, leading into the depth of the wood. Under his guidance we\r\ncontinued for some distance, every now and then crossing one of the\r\nforest creeks on the logs. Seeing that I was rather timid, he cut for me\r\na long pole, with the aid of which I felt quite brave. But at last we\r\ncame to a place where the water was so deep that I could not touch\r\nbottom with my pole, and as the round log on which I was to cross was\r\nrather rocking and unsteady, I did not dare to advance. I told him, in\r\nmy imperfect Portuguese, that I was afraid. “Naō, mia branca” (No, my\r\nwhite) he said, reassuringly; “naō tem medo” (don’t be afraid). Then, as\r\nif a thought struck him, he motioned me to wait, and, going a few steps\r\nup the creek, he unloosed his boat, brought it down to the spot where we\r\nstood, and put us across to the opposite shore. Just beyond was his\r\npretty, picturesque home, where he showed me his children, telling me\r\ntheir ages, and introduced me to his wife. There is a natural courtesy\r\nabout these people which is very attractive, and which Major Coutinho,\r\nwho has lived among them a great deal, tells me is a general\r\ncharacteristic of the Amazonian Indians. When we took leave of them and\r\nreturned to the canoe, I supposed our guide would simply put us across\r\nto the other shore, a distance of a few feet only, as he had done in\r\ncoming. Instead of that he headed the canoe up the creek into the wood.\r\nI shall never forget that row, the more enchanting that it was so\r\nunexpected, through the narrow water-path, overarched by a solid roof of\r\nverdure, and black with shadows; and yet it was not gloomy, for outside,\r\nthe sun was setting in crimson and gold, and its last beams struck in\r\nunder the boughs and lit the interior of the forest with a warm glow.\r\nNor shall I easily forget the face of our Indian friend, who had\r\nwelcomed us so warmly to his home, and who evidently enjoyed our\r\nexclamations of delight and the effect of the surprise he had given us.\r\nThe creek led by a detour back into the river, a few rods above the\r\nlanding where our steamer lay. Our friendly boatman left us at the\r\nstairway with a cordial good-by, and many thanks from us at parting.\r\n\r\nWe left our landing early this morning, and at about half past ten\r\nturned into the main Amazons. Thus far we have been in what is called\r\nthe Pará river, and the branches connecting it with the Amazons proper.\r\nThe proportions of everything in nature amaze one here, however much one\r\nmay have heard or read about them. For two days and nights we have been\r\nfollowing the isle of Marajo, which, though but an island in the mouth\r\nof the Amazons, is half as large as Ireland. I add here a second letter\r\nfrom Mr. Agassiz to Mr. Pimenta Bueno, giving a short summary of his\r\nscientific progress.\r\n\r\n  MON CHER AMI:—Je suis exténué de fatigue, mais je ne veux pas aller\r\n  me reposer avant de vous avoir écrit un mot. Hier soir nous avons\r\n  obtenu vingt-sept espèces de poissons à Gurupá et ce matin,\r\n  cinquante-sept à Porto do Moz, en tout quatre-vingt-quatre espèces\r\n  en moins de douze heures et, sur ce nombre, il y en à cinquante et\r\n  une nouvelles. C’est merveilleux. Je ne puis plus mettre en ordre ce\r\n  qu’on m’apporte au fur et à mesure que cela arrive; et quant à\r\n  obtenir des dessins coloriés du tout, il n’en est plus question, à\r\n  moins qu’à notre retour nous ne passions une semaine entière ici.\r\n\r\n                                             Tout à vous,\r\n\r\n                                                       L. AGASSIZ.[54]\r\n\r\n_August 23d._—Yesterday morning, before reaching the little town of\r\nGurupá, we passed a forest of Miriti palms; it is the first time we have\r\nseen a palm wood exclusive of other trees. In the afternoon we stopped\r\nat Gurupá and went on shore; but just as we landed, a violent\r\nthunder-storm burst upon us with sheets of rain, and we saw little of\r\nthe town except the inside of the house where we took shelter. Mr.\r\nAgassiz obtained a most valuable collection of “forest fishes,”\r\ncontaining a number of new species; the Indians enumerate, however, some\r\nseventy distinct species of forest fishes in this vicinity, so that,\r\nnotwithstanding his success, he leaves much to be done by those who\r\nshall come after him. We left during the night, and this morning we\r\nentered the river Xingu, stopping at Porto do Moz. The water is very\r\nblue and dark as compared with the muddy waters of the main river. Here\r\nMr. Agassiz found two collections, one of forest fishes, the other of\r\nriver fishes, awaiting him, Mr. Pimenta Bueno having sent messengers by\r\nthe last steamer to a number of ports, desiring that collections should\r\nbe in readiness for him. The harvest of this morning, however, was such\r\nan one as makes an era in the life of a naturalist, for it contained\r\nforty-eight new species,—more, Mr. Agassiz said, than it had ever fallen\r\nto his lot to find in the course of a single day. Ever since we entered\r\nthe Amazons the forest seems to me, though more luxuriant, less sombre\r\nthan it did about Rio. It is more transparent and more smiling; one sees\r\ninto it, and sees the sunshine glimmering through it and lighting up its\r\ndepths. The steamer has just left behind the first open land we have\r\npassed,—wide, extensive flats, with scarcely a tree, and covered with\r\nthick, coarse grass.\r\n\r\n_August 24th._—Yesterday afternoon we saw, on the north side of the\r\nriver, the first elevations of any consequence one meets on the Amazons,\r\nthe singular flat-topped hills of Almeirim. They are cut off as squarely\r\non the top as if levelled with a plane, and divided from each other by\r\nwide openings, the sides being shaved down with the same evenness as the\r\nsummits. Much has been said about the geology of these singular hills,\r\nbut no one has fairly investigated it. Von Martius landed, and\r\nascertained their height to be about eight hundred feet above the level\r\nof the river, but beyond this, no one seems to know anything of their\r\nreal nature. They are generally represented as spurs of the higher\r\ntable-land of Guiana.[55] Last evening was the most beautiful we have\r\nseen on the Amazons. We sat on the front upper deck as the crimson sun\r\nwent down, his broad red pathway across the water followed presently by\r\nthe pale trembling line of light from the crescent moon above. After the\r\nsun had vanished, broad rays of rose-color, shooting almost to the\r\nzenith, still attested his power, lending something of their glow also\r\nto a great mass of white clouds in the east, the reflection of which\r\nturned the yellow waters of the river to silver, while between glory and\r\nglory the deep blue sky of night gathered over the hills of Almeirim.\r\nThis morning at dawn we stopped at the little settlement of Prainha, but\r\ndid not land, and we are now on our way to Monte Alégre, where we shall\r\npass a day and a half.\r\n\r\n_August 25th._—Monte Alégre. We arrived before this town, situated on\r\nthe north side of the Amazons, at the mouth of the river Gurupatuba,\r\nyesterday at about midday, but the heat was so great that I did not go\r\non shore till towards evening. The town is situated on the summit of a\r\nhill sloping rather steeply upward from the shore, and it takes its name\r\nfrom a mountain some four leagues to the northwest of it. But though the\r\nground is more broken and various than we have seen it hitherto, the\r\nplace does not seem to me to deserve its name of Monte Alégre (the gay\r\nmountain). To me the aspect of the country here is, on the contrary,\r\nrather sombre; the soil consists everywhere of sand, the forest is low,\r\nwhile here and there intervene wide, swampy flats, covered with coarse\r\ngrass. The sand rests above the same reddish drift, filled with smooth\r\nrounded quartz pebbles, that we have followed along our whole road. Here\r\nand there the pebbles are disposed in undulating lines, as if a partial\r\nstratification had taken place; and in some localities we saw\r\nindications of the drift having been worked over by water, though not\r\nabsolutely stratified. Both at sunset and sunrise I took a walk to the\r\nvillage churchyard, which commands the prettiest view in the\r\nneighborhood. It is enclosed in a picket fence, a large wooden cross\r\nstands in the centre, and there are a few other small crosses marking\r\ngraves; but the place looked uncared for, grown over, wherever the sand\r\nwas not bare, by the same coarse, rank shrubs which spring up everywhere\r\nin this ungenial soil.[56] At a little distance from the churchyard, the\r\nhill slopes abruptly down, and from its brow one looks across a wide\r\nplain covered with low forest, to the mountain on the other side, from\r\nwhich the town takes its name. Looking southward, the foreground is\r\nfilled with lakes divided from each other by low alluvial lands, forming\r\nthe level flats alluded to above. Though one of the earliest settlements\r\non the Amazons, this town is, by all accounts, rather decreasing than\r\nincreasing in population. In the midst of its public square stands what\r\nseems at first to be the ruin of a large stone church, but which is, in\r\nfact, the framework of a cathedral begun forty years ago, and standing\r\nunfinished to this day. Cows were pastured in its grass-grown aisles,\r\nand it seemed a rather sad memorial, bespeaking a want of prosperity in\r\nthe place. We were most kindly entertained in the house of Senhor\r\nManuel, who, finding that the mosquitoes were likely to be very thick on\r\nboard the steamer, invited us to pass the night under his roof. This\r\nmorning we are sailing about in the neighborhood, partly for the sake of\r\ngetting fish, but passing also a couple of hours at a cattle-farm near\r\nby, in order to bring on board a number of cows and oxen for the Manaos\r\nmarket. It seems that one of the chief occupations here is the raising\r\nof cattle. This, with the sale of fish, cacáo, and India-rubber,\r\nconstitutes the commerce of the place.\r\n\r\n_August 26th._—This morning found us again on the southern side of the\r\nriver, off Santarem, at the mouth of one of the great branches of the\r\nAmazons, the Tapajoz. Here we leave a number of our party. Mr. Dexter,\r\nMr. James, and Mr. Talisman, a young Brazilian who joined our party at\r\nPará, go on a collecting expedition up the Tapajoz. Mr. Bourget and Mr.\r\nHunnewell remain at Santarem, the former to make collections, the latter\r\nto attend to the repairs of his photographing apparatus, which has met\r\nwith some disasters. We are all to meet again at Manaos for our farther\r\nvoyage up to Tabatinga.[57] We remained at Santarem only long enough to\r\nsee the party fitted out with a canoe and the necessary supplies, and as\r\nthey put off from the steamer we weighed anchor and proceeded on our\r\nway, reserving our visit to Santarem for our return. As we left the port\r\nthe black waters of the Tapajoz met the yellow stream of the Amazons,\r\nand the two ran together for a while, like the waters of the Arve and\r\nRhone in Switzerland, meeting but not mingling. Instead of returning at\r\nonce to the main river, the Captain, who omits nothing which can add to\r\nthe pleasure or the profit of our voyage, put the steamer through a\r\nnarrow channel, which, on the Mississippi, would be called a “bayou,”\r\nbut goes here by the name of an “Igarapé.” Nothing could be prettier\r\nthan this “Igarapé Assú,” hardly more than wide enough to admit the\r\nsteamer, and bordered on either side by a thick wood, in which are\r\nconspicuous the Munguba, with its oval, red fruit, the Imbauba-tree,\r\nneither so lofty nor so regular in form as about Rio, and the Taxi, with\r\nits masses of white flowers and brown buds. For two days past we have\r\nlost the palms in a great degree; about Monte Alégre they were\r\ncomparatively few, and here we see scarcely any.\r\n\r\nThe shore between Santarem and Obydos, where we shall arrive this\r\nevening, seems more populous than the regions we have been passing\r\nthrough. As we coast along, keeping close to the land, the scenes revive\r\nall our early visions of an ancient pastoral life. Groups of\r\nIndians—men, women, and children—greet us from the shore, standing under\r\nthe overarching trees, usually trained or purposely chosen to form a\r\nkind of arbor over the landing-place,—the invariable foreground of the\r\npicture, with the “montaria” moored in front. One or two hammocks are\r\noften slung in the trees, and between the branches one gets a glimpse of\r\nthe thatched roof and walls of the little straw cottage behind. Perhaps\r\nif we were to look a little closer at these pictures of pastoral life,\r\nwe should find they have a coarse and prosaic side. But let them stand.\r\nArcadia itself would not bear a too minute scrutiny, nor could it\r\npresent a fairer aspect than do these Indian homes on the banks of the\r\nAmazons. The primitive forest about the houses is usually cleared, and\r\nthey stand in the midst of little plantations of the cacáo-tree, mingled\r\nwith the mandioca shrub, from the roots of which the Indians make their\r\nflour, and occasionally also with the India-rubber-tree, though, as the\r\nlatter grows plentifully in the forest, it is not often cultivated. The\r\ncacáo and the India-rubber they send to Pará, in exchange for such\r\ndomestic goods as they require. We have passed so close to the shore\r\nto-day that it has been easy to make geological observations from the\r\ndeck. For a considerable distance above Santarem we have followed drift\r\ncliffs, resting upon sandstone; the drift of the same reddish color, and\r\npasty, clayey consistence, and the sandstone seemingly the same in\r\ncharacter, as that of Monte Alégre.\r\n\r\n_August 27th._—Villa Bella. Last evening we stopped to wood at the town\r\nof Obydos, but without landing; keeping straight on to this port, on the\r\nsouthern side of the river, at the mouth of the river Tupinambaranas.\r\nHere we were very cordially received by Dr. Marcus, an old correspondent\r\nof Mr. Agassiz, who has several times sent specimens from the Amazons to\r\nthe Cambridge Museum. To-night we are to start in canoes on an excursion\r\nto some of the lakes in the neighborhood of this port.\r\n\r\n_August 28th._—In the porch of an Indian house on the lake José Assú. We\r\npassed a pleasant day yesterday at the house of Dr. Marcus, keeping the\r\nSabbath rather after the Jewish than the Christian rule, as a veritable\r\nday of rest, lounging in hammocks, and the gentlemen smoking. We\r\nreturned to the steamer at five o’clock, intending to start at six, in\r\norder to have the benefit of the night fishing, said to be always the\r\nmost successful. But a violent thunder-storm, with heavy rain, lasting\r\nalmost till midnight, delayed our departure. We loaded the boats,\r\nhowever, before night, that we might be ready to start whenever the\r\nweather should clear. We have two canoes, in one of which Mr. Agassiz,\r\nmyself, and Mr. Burkhardt have our quarters, while Major Coutinho, Dr.\r\nMarcus, who accompanies us, and Mr. Thayer occupy the other. The former,\r\nwhich is rather the larger of the two, has a tiny cabin at one end, some\r\nthree feet high and six feet long, roofed in with wood; the other has\r\nalso one end covered in, but with thatch instead of wood. In the larger\r\nboat we have our luggage, compressed to the utmost, the live stock,—a\r\nsmall sheep, a turkey, and several fowls,—besides a number of barrels\r\nand kegs, containing alcohol, for specimens. The Captain has supplied us\r\nnot only with all the necessaries, but, so far as is possible, with\r\nevery luxury, for a week’s voyage. All our preparations being made, and\r\nno prospect of clear weather, at nine o’clock we betook ourselves to our\r\nhammocks,—or those of us who had stowed their hammocks out of reach,—to\r\nchairs and benches, and had a broken sleep till three o’clock. The stars\r\nwere then shining, and everything looked fair for our voyage. The wind\r\nhad gone down, the river was smooth as glass when we paddled away from\r\nthe side of the steamer, and, though we had no moon, one or two planets\r\nthrew a bright reflection across the water to cheer our way. After\r\nkeeping for some time down the river, we turned, just at dawn, into a\r\nvery narrow channel leading through the forest. It was hardly day, but\r\nperhaps the scene was none the less impressive for the dim half-light in\r\nwhich we saw it. From the verdant walls, which rose on either side and\r\nshut us in, lofty trees, clothed from base to summit in vines, stood out\r\nhere and there like huge green columns, in bold relief against the\r\nmorning sky; hidden flowers filled the air with fragrance, great roots\r\nstretched out into the water, and now and then a floating log narrowed\r\nthe passage so as just to leave room for the canoe to pass. After a\r\nwhile a broader, fuller light shone under the boughs, and we issued from\r\nthis narrow pathway into an extensive lake. Here it was found that the\r\nlarge net, which was to have made a part of the outfit of the canoe, had\r\nbeen left behind, and, after calling at two or three Indian houses to\r\nsee if we could supply the deficiency, we were obliged to send back to\r\nVilla Bella for it. In the mean time we moored our boats at the foot of\r\na little hill, on which stands an Indian house, where we stopped to\r\nbreakfast, and where we are still waiting for the return of our\r\nmessengers. I must say, that a near view of Arcadia tends to dispel\r\nillusions; but it should be added, that this specimen is by no means a\r\nfavorable one. The houses at Tajapurú were far more attractive, and the\r\nappearance of their inhabitants much neater and more respectable, than\r\nthose of our friends here. Yet at this moment the scene is not\r\naltogether uninviting. Some of the party are lounging in the hammocks,\r\nwhich we have slung under the great porch, as we are to pass several\r\nhours here; an improvised rustic table, consisting of a board resting on\r\nforked sticks, stands at one side; the boatmen are clearing away the\r\nremains of our late repast; the Indian women, dirty, half clad, with\r\ntheir hair hanging uncombed around their faces, are tending their naked\r\nchildren, or kneading the mandioca in a huge trough. The men of the\r\nhouse have just returned from fishing, the morning having been more\r\nsuccessful in that respect than was expected, and are now fitting up a\r\nrough forge, in which they are repairing some of their iron instruments.\r\nIn the mean time Science has its sacred corner, where Mr. Agassiz is\r\ninvestigating new species, the result of the morning’s fishing, while\r\nMr. Burkhardt is drawing them.\r\n\r\n_August 29th._—Finding yesterday that our shelter grew more\r\nuncomfortable as the day wore on, and being obliged to wait for the\r\nnight fishing, we determined to cross the lake to a “Sitio” (as the\r\ninhabitants call their plantations) on the other side of the lake. Here\r\nwe found one of the better specimens of Indian houses. On one side of\r\nthe house is the open porch, quite gay at this moment with our brightly\r\ncolored hammocks; adjoining this is a large chamber, opening into the\r\nporch by a wide straw, or rather palm-leaf door; which does not swing on\r\nhinges, however, but is taken down and put up like a mat. On the other\r\nside of the room is an unglazed window, closed at will in the same way\r\nby a palm-leaf mat. For the present this chamber is given up to my use.\r\nOn the other side of the porch is another veranda-like room, also open\r\nat the sides, and apparently the working-room of the family; for here is\r\nthe great round oven, built of mud, where the farinha is dried, and the\r\nbaskets of mandioca-root are standing ready to be picked and grated, and\r\nhere also is the rough log table where we take our meals. Everything has\r\nan air of decency and cleanliness; the mud-floors are swept, the ground\r\nabout the house is tidy and free from rubbish, the little plantation\r\naround it of cacáo and mandioca, with here and there a coffee-shrub, is\r\nin nice order. The house stands on a slightly rising ground, sloping\r\ngently upward from the lake, and just below, under some trees on the\r\nshore, are moored the Indian’s “Montaria” and our two canoes. We were\r\nreceived with the most cordial friendliness, the Indian women gathering\r\nabout me and examining, though not in a rough or rude way, my dress, the\r\nnet on my hair, touching my rings and watch-chain, and evidently\r\ndiscussing the “branca” between themselves. In the evening, after\r\ndinner, I walked up and down outside the house, enjoying the\r\npicturesqueness of the scene. The husband had just come in from the\r\nlake, and the fire on the ground, over which the fresh fish was broiling\r\nfor the supper of the family, shone on the figures of the women and\r\nchildren as they moved about, and shed its glow under the thatched roof\r\nof the working-room, making its interior warm and ruddy; a lantern in\r\nthe corner of the porch threw a dim, uncertain light over hammocks and\r\nhalf-recumbent figures, and without, the moon shone over lake and\r\nforest. The mosquitoes, however, presently began to disturb the romance\r\nof the scene, and, as we were all rather tired from our broken rest the\r\nnight before, we retired early. My own sleep, under an excellent\r\nmosquito-net, was very quiet and refreshing, but there were some of the\r\nparty who had not provided themselves with this indispensable\r\naccompaniment of a hammock, and they passed the night in misery,\r\naffording a repast to the voracious hordes buzzing about them. I was\r\nawakened shortly after daylight by the Indian women, bringing me a\r\nbouquet of roses and jessamine from the vines which grew about the\r\ncottage, and wishing me good morning. After such a kindly greeting, I\r\ncould not refuse them the pleasure of assisting at my toilet, of\r\nwatching the opening of my valise, and handling every article as it came\r\nout.\r\n\r\nThe night fishing was unfavorable, but this morning the fishermen have\r\nbrought in new species enough to keep Mr. Agassiz and his artist busy\r\nfor many hours, so that we are likely to pass another night among these\r\nhospitable people. I must say that the primitive life of the better\r\nclass of Indians on the Amazons is much more attractive than the\r\nso-called civilized life in the white settlements. Anything more bald,\r\ndreary, and uninviting than life in the Amazonian towns, with an attempt\r\nat the conventionalisms of civilization, but without one of its graces,\r\nI can hardly conceive. This morning my Indian friends have been showing\r\nme the various processes to which the Mandioca is subjected. This plant\r\nis invaluable to these people. It gives them their farinha,—a coarse\r\nkind of flour, their only substitute for bread,—their tapioca, and also\r\na kind of fermented juice called tucupi,—a more questionable blessing,\r\nperhaps, since it affords them the means of getting intoxicated. After\r\nbeing peeled, the roots of the mandioca are scraped on a very coarse\r\ngrater; in this condition they make a moist kind of paste, which is then\r\npacked in elastic straw tubes, made of the fibres of the Jacitará Palm\r\n(Desmonchus). When her tube, which has always a loop at either end, is\r\nfull, the Indian woman hangs it on the branch of a tree; she then passes\r\na pole through the lower loop and into a hole in the trunk of the tree,\r\nand, sitting down on the other end of the pole, she thus transforms it\r\ninto a primitive kind of lever, drawing out the tube to its utmost\r\nlength by the pressure of her own weight. The juice is thus expressed,\r\nflowing into a bowl placed under the tube. This juice is poisonous at\r\nfirst, but after being fermented becomes quite harmless, and is then\r\nused for the tucupi. The tapioca is made by mixing the grated mandioca\r\nwith water. It is then pressed on a sieve, and the fluid which flows out\r\nis left to stand. It soon makes a deposit like starch, and when hardened\r\nthey make it into a kind of porridge. It is a favorite article of food\r\nwith them.\r\n\r\n_August 30th._—As time goes on, we grow more at home with our rustic\r\nfriends here, and begin to understand their relations to each other. The\r\nname of our host is Laudigári (I spell the name as it sounds), and that\r\nof his wife Esperança. He, like all the Indians living upon the Amazons,\r\nis a fisherman, and, with the exception of such little care as his small\r\nplantation requires, this is his only occupation. An Indian is never\r\nseen to do any of the work of the house, not even to bring wood or water\r\nor lift the heavy burdens, and as the fishing is done chiefly at certain\r\nseasons, he is a very idle fellow for a great part of the time. The\r\nwomen are said, on the contrary, to be very industrious; and certainly\r\nthose whom we have an opportunity of seeing here justify this\r\nreputation. Esperança is always busy at some household work or\r\nother,—grating mandioca, drying farinha, packing tobacco, cooking or\r\nsweeping. Her children are active and obedient, the older ones making\r\nthemselves useful in bringing water from the lake, in washing the\r\nmandioca, or in taking care of the younger ones. Esperança can hardly be\r\ncalled pretty, but she has a pleasant smile and a remarkably sweet\r\nvoice, with a kind of child-like intonation, which is very winning; and\r\nwhen sometimes, after her work is over, she puts on her white chemise,\r\nfalling loose from her brown shoulders, her dark skirt, and a rose or a\r\nsprig of white jessamine in her jetty hair, she is by no means\r\nunattractive in her personal appearance, though I must confess that the\r\npipe which she is apt to smoke in the evening injures the general\r\neffect. Her husband looks somewhat sombre; but his hearty laugh\r\noccasionally, and his enjoyment of the glass of cachaça which rewards\r\nhim when he brings in a new lot of specimens, shows that he has his\r\nbright side. He is greatly amused at the value Mr. Agassiz attaches to\r\nthe fishes, especially the little ones, which appear to him only fit to\r\nthrow away. It seems that the other family who have been about here\r\nsince our arrival are neighbors, who have come in to help in the making\r\nof mandioca. They come in the morning with all their children and remain\r\nthrough the day. The names of the father and mother are Pedro Manuel and\r\nMichelina. He is a tall, handsome fellow, whose chief occupation seems\r\nto be that of standing about in picturesque attitudes, and watching his\r\nrather pretty wife, as she bustles round in her various work of grating\r\nor pressing or straining the mandioca, generally with her baby astride\r\non her hip,—the Indian woman’s favorite way of carrying her child.\r\nOccasionally, however, Pedro Manuel is aroused to bear some part in the\r\ncollecting; and the other day, when he brought in some specimens which\r\nseemed to him quite valueless, Mr. Agassiz rewarded him with a chicken.\r\nHis surprise and delight were great, perhaps a little mingled with\r\ncontempt for the man who would barter a chicken for a few worthless\r\nfishes, fit only to throw into the river.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Esperança’s Cottage.]\r\n\r\nLast evening, with some difficulty, we induced Laudigári to play for us\r\non a rough kind of lute or guitar,—a favorite instrument with the\r\ncountry people, and used by them as an accompaniment for dancing. When\r\nwe had him fairly _en train_ with the music, we persuaded Esperança and\r\nMichelina to show us some of their dances; not without reluctance, and\r\nwith an embarrassment which savored somewhat of the self-consciousness\r\nof civilized life, they stood up with two of our boatmen. The dance is\r\nvery peculiar; so languid that it hardly deserves the name. There is\r\nalmost no movement of the body; they lift the arms, but in an angular\r\nposition with no freedom of motion, snapping the fingers like castanets\r\nin time to the music, and they seem rather like statues gliding from\r\nplace to place than like dancers. This is especially true of the women,\r\nwho are still more quiet than the men. One of the boatmen was a\r\nBolivian, a finely formed, picturesque-looking man, whose singular dress\r\nheightened the effect of his peculiar movements. The Bolivian Indians\r\nwear a kind of toga; at least I do not know how otherwise to designate\r\ntheir long straight robe of heavy twilled cotton cloth. It consists of\r\ntwo pieces, hanging before and behind, fastened on the shoulder; leaving\r\nonly an aperture for the head to pass through. It is belted around the\r\nwaist, leaving the sides open so that the legs and arms are perfectly\r\nfree. The straight folds of his heavy white drapery gave a sort of\r\nstatuesque look to our Bolivian as he moved slowly about in the dance.\r\nAfter it was over, Esperança and the others urged me to show them the\r\ndance “of my country,” as they said, and my young friend R—— and I\r\nwaltzed for them, to their great delight. It seemed to me like a strange\r\ndream. The bright fire danced with us, flickering in under the porch,\r\nfitfully lighting its picturesque interior and the group of wondering\r\nIndians around us, who encouraged us every now and then with a “Mûito\r\nbonito, mia branca, mûito bonito” (Very pretty, my white, very pretty).\r\nOur ball kept up very late, and after I had gone to my hammock I still\r\nheard, between waking and sleeping, the plaintive chords of the guitar,\r\nmingling with the melancholy note of a kind of whippoorwill, who sings\r\nin the woods all night. This morning the forest is noisy with the\r\nhowling monkeys. They sound very near and very numerous; but we are told\r\nthat they are deep in the forest, and would disappear at the slightest\r\napproach.\r\n\r\n_September 1st._—Yesterday morning we bade our friendly hosts good-by,\r\nleaving their pretty picturesque home with real regret. The night before\r\nwe left, they got together some of their neighbors in our honor, and\r\nrenewed the ball of the previous evening. Like things of the same kind\r\nin other classes, the second occasion, got up with a little more\r\npreparation than the first, which was wholly impromptu, was neither so\r\ngay nor so pretty. Frequent potations of cachaça made the guests rather\r\nnoisy, and their dancing, under this influence, became far more\r\nanimated, and by no means so serious and dignified as the evening\r\nbefore. One thing which occurred early in the entertainment, however,\r\nwas interesting, as showing something of their religious observances. In\r\nthe morning Esperança’s mother, a hideous old Indian woman, had come\r\ninto my room to make me a visit. Before leaving, I was rather surprised\r\nto see her kneel down by a little trunk in the corner, and, opening the\r\nlid slightly, throw in repeated kisses, touching her lips to her fingers\r\nand making gestures as if she dropped the kisses into the trunk,\r\ncrossing herself at intervals as she did so. In the evening she was\r\nagain at the dance, and, with the other two women, went through with a\r\nsort of religious dance, chanting the while, and carrying in their hands\r\na carved arch of wood which they waved to and fro in time to the chant.\r\nWhen I asked Esperança the meaning of this, she told me that, though\r\nthey went to the neighboring town of Villa Bella for the great fête of\r\nour Lady of Nazareth, they kept it also at home on their return, and\r\nthis was a part of their ceremonies. And then she asked me to come in\r\nwith her, and, leading the way to my room, introduced me to the contents\r\nof the precious trunk; there was our Lady of Nazareth, a common coarse\r\nprint, framed in wood, one or two other smaller colored prints and a few\r\ncandles; over the whole was thrown a blue gauze. It was the family\r\nchapel, and she showed me all the things, taking them up one by one with\r\na kind of tender, joyful reverence, only made the more touching by their\r\nwant of any material value.\r\n\r\nWe are now at another Indian house on the bank of an arm of the river\r\nRamos, connecting the Amazons, through the Mauhes, with the Madeira. Our\r\ntwo hours’ canoe-journey yesterday, in the middle of the day, was\r\nsomewhat hot and wearisome, though part of it lay through one of the\r\nshady narrow channels I have described before. The Indians have a pretty\r\nname for these channels in the forest; they call them Igarapés, that is,\r\nboat-paths, and they literally are in many places just wide enough for\r\nthe canoe. At about four o’clock we arrived at our present lodging,\r\nwhich is by no means so pretty as the one we have left, though it\r\nstands, like that, on the slope of a hill just above the shore, with the\r\nforest about it. But it lacks the wide porch and the open working-room\r\nwhich made the other house so picturesque. Mosquitoes are plentiful, and\r\nat nightfall the house is closed and a pan of turf burned before the\r\ndoor to drive them away. Our host and hostess, by name José Antonio Maia\r\nand Maria Joanna Maia, do what they can, however, to make us\r\ncomfortable, and the children as well as the parents show that natural\r\ncourtesy which has struck us so much among these Indians. The children\r\nare constantly bringing me flowers and such little gifts as they have it\r\nin their power to bestow, especially the painted cups which the Indians\r\nmake from the fruit of the Crescentia, and use as drinking-cups, basins,\r\nand the like. One sees numbers of them in all the Indian houses along\r\nthe Amazons. My books and writing seem to interest them very much, and\r\nwhile I was reading at the window of my room this morning, the father\r\nand mother came up, and, after watching me a few minutes in silence, the\r\nfather asked me, if I had any leaves out of some old book which was\r\nuseless to me, or even a part of any old newspaper, to leave it with him\r\nwhen I went away. Once, he said, he had known how to read a little, and\r\nhe seemed to think if he had something to practise upon, he might\r\nrecover the lost art. His face fell when I told him all my books were\r\nEnglish: it was a bucket of cold water to his literary ambition. Then he\r\nadded, that one of his little boys was very bright, and he was sure he\r\ncould learn, if he had the means of sending him to school. When I told\r\nhim that I lived in a country where a good education was freely given to\r\nthe child of every poor man, he said if the “branca” did not live so far\r\naway, he would ask her to take his daughter with her, and for her\r\nservices to have her taught to read and write. The man has a bright,\r\nintelligent face, and speaks with genuine feeling of his desire to give\r\nan education to his children.\r\n\r\n_September 3d._—Yesterday we started on our return, and after a warm and\r\nwearisome row of four hours reached our steamer at five o’clock in the\r\nafternoon. The scientific results of this expedition have been most\r\nsatisfactory. The collections, differing greatly from each other in\r\ncharacter, are very large from both our stations, and Mr. Burkhardt has\r\nbeen indefatigable in making colored drawings of the specimens while\r\ntheir tints were yet fresh. This is no easy task, for the mosquitoes\r\nbuzz about him and sometimes make work almost intolerable. This morning\r\nMaia brought in a superb Pirarara (fish parrot). This fish is already\r\nwell known to science; it is a heavy, broad-headed hornpout, with a bony\r\nshield over the whole head; its general color is jet black, but it has\r\nbright yellow sides, deepening into orange here and there. Its\r\nsystematic name is Phractocephalus bicolor. The yellow fat of this fish\r\nhas a curious property; the Indians tell us that when parrots are fed\r\nupon it they become tinged with yellow, and they often use it to render\r\ntheir “papagaios” more variegated.[58]\r\n\r\nDuring our absence the commander of our steamer, Captain Anacleto, and\r\none or two gentlemen of the town, among others Senhor Augustinho, and\r\nalso Father Torquato, whose name occurs often in Bates’s work on the\r\nAmazons, have been making a collection of river fishes, in which Mr.\r\nAgassiz finds some fifty new species. Thus the harvest of the week has\r\nbeen a rich one. To-day we are on our way to Manaos, where we expect to\r\narrive in the course of to-morrow.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 51:\r\n\r\n  Senhor Sepeda, a most hospitable and courteous gentleman, to whom we\r\n  were indebted then and afterwards for much kindness, and also for\r\n  valuable collections put up during our journey to the Upper Amazons.\r\n\r\nFootnote 52:\r\n\r\n                       August 22d, morning: between Tajapurú and Gurupá.\r\n\r\n  MY DEAR FRIEND:—Yesterday was a most instructive day,—above all, in\r\n  the “forest fishes.” We have obtained fifteen species in all. Out of\r\n  this number ten are new, four are found also in Pará, and one has been\r\n  already described by me in the voyage of Spix and Martius; but what is\r\n  most interesting is the proof furnished by these species, taken in\r\n  their totality, that the fishes inhabiting the waters west of the\r\n  group of islands called Marajó, when considered as a whole, differ\r\n  from those of the Pará river. The list of names which we have asked\r\n  from the Indians shows, further, that the number of species found in\r\n  these localities exceeds greatly that which we have been able to\r\n  procure; for this reason we have left cans at Breves and at Tajapurú\r\n  in order to complete the collection. I add some remarks which will\r\n  help you to appreciate these differences, if you wish to compare them\r\n  with the catalogue of the Pará species which I left with you.\r\n  Considering all, it seems to me already apparent that our voyage will\r\n  make a revolution in Ichthyology. In the first place, the Jacundá of\r\n  Tajapurú is different from those of Pará; so is the Acará; then we\r\n  have a new species of Sarapó, and also one of Jeju; a new species of\r\n  Rabeca, a new species of Anojá, a new genus of Candiru, a new genus of\r\n  Bagre, a new genus of Acary, and a new species of Acary belonging to\r\n  the same genus as that of Pará; also a new species of Matupirim. Add\r\n  to this a species of Aracú, already described, but which is not found\r\n  at Pará, and you will have at Tajapurú eleven species which do not\r\n  exist at Pará, to which must be added four species which are found at\r\n  Tajapurú as well as at Pará, and one which occurs at Pará, Breves, and\r\n  Tajapurú. In all twenty species, of which fifteen are new, in two\r\n  days. Unhappily, the Indians have misunderstood our directions, and\r\n  have brought us but one specimen of each species. There remains, then,\r\n  much to do in these localities, judging from the catalogue of names\r\n  collected by Major Coutinho, which includes twenty-six species from\r\n  the forest and forty-six from the river. We are still lacking at least\r\n  fifty-two species from Tajapurú, even supposing that this locality\r\n  contains also the five species from Breves. You see that we shall yet\r\n  leave a large share of the work to our successors.\r\n\r\n                               Adieu for to-day, your affectionate\r\n\r\n                                                             L. AGASSIZ.\r\n\r\nFootnote 53:\r\n\r\n  The opportunity of watching these fishes in their natural element, and\r\n  keeping many of them alive for hours or days in our glass tanks, was\r\n  very instructive, and suggested comparisons not dreamed of before. Our\r\n  arrangements were very convenient; and as the commander of the steamer\r\n  allowed me to encumber the deck with all sorts of scientific\r\n  apparatus, I had a number of large glass dishes and wooden tubs in\r\n  which I kept such specimens as I wished to investigate with special\r\n  care and to have drawn from life. One of the most striking changes\r\n  made by J. Müller, in the classification of the spiny fishes, was the\r\n  separation into a distinct order, under the name of Pharyngognathi, of\r\n  all those in which the pharyngeal bones are soldered together. With\r\n  these the illustrious German anatomist has associated a number of\r\n  soft-rayed types, formerly united with the Pickerels and Herrings, and\r\n  characterized by the same structure. It would thus seem that there is\r\n  here a definite anatomical character easily traceable, by the aid of\r\n  which a vast number of fishes might be correctly classified. But the\r\n  question at once arises, Are these fishes truly related to one\r\n  another, and so combined in this new order of Pharyngognathi as to\r\n  include all which properly belong with them, and none others? I think\r\n  not. I believe that Müller has always placed too much value upon\r\n  isolated anatomical characters; and, while he was undoubtedly one of\r\n  the greatest anatomists and physiologists of our age, he lacked\r\n  zoölogical tact. This is especially evident with reference to the\r\n  order of Pharyngognathi, for though the Scomberesoces have fixed\r\n  pharyngeals like Chromides, Pomacentrides, Labroids, Holconotes, and\r\n  Gerrides, they have no real affinities with these families. Again, the\r\n  character assigned to this order is not constant even in the typical\r\n  Pharyngognathi. I have found Chromides and Gerrides with movable\r\n  pharyngeals; in the genus Cychla they are normally so. It is therefore\r\n  not out of place to state here that the Chromides of South America are\r\n  in reality closely related to a group of fishes very generally found\r\n  in the United States, known as Pomotis, Bryttus, Centrarchus, etc.,\r\n  and usually referred to the family of Perches, from which they have,\r\n  however, been separated by Dr. Holbrook under the name of\r\n  Helichthyoids. They not only resemble the Chromides in their form, but\r\n  even in their habits, mode of reproduction, peculiar movements, and\r\n  even in their coloration. Cuvier has already shown that Enoplosus is\r\n  not a member of the family of Chætodonts, and I may now add that it is\r\n  a near relative of the Chromides, and should stand by the side of\r\n  Pterophyllum in a natural system. Monocirrus of Heckel, which I\r\n  consider as the type of a small family under the name of Folhidæ, is\r\n  also closely allied to these, though provided with a barbel, and\r\n  should be placed with Polycentrus side by side with the Chromides and\r\n  Helichthyoids. The manner in which Pterophyllum moves is quite\r\n  peculiar. The profile of the head and the extended anterior margin of\r\n  the high dorsal are brought on a level, parallel to the surface of the\r\n  water, when the long ventrals and high anal hang down vertically, and\r\n  the fish progresses slowly by the lateral beating of the tail.—L. A.\r\n\r\nFootnote 54:\r\n\r\n                                         ON THE XINGU, August 23d, 1865.\r\n\r\n  MY DEAR FRIEND:—I am worn out with fatigue, but I will not go to rest\r\n  before writing you a word. Yesterday evening we obtained twenty-seven\r\n  species of fish at Gurupá and this morning fifty-seven at Porto do\r\n  Moz,—eighty-four species in all, in less than twelve hours, and of\r\n  this number fifty-one are new. It is wonderful. I can no longer put in\r\n  order what is brought to me as fast as it arrives, and as to obtaining\r\n  colored drawings of all, it is no longer possible, unless we pass a\r\n  whole week here on our return.\r\n\r\n                                             Wholly yours,\r\n\r\n                                                             L. AGASSIZ.\r\n\r\nFootnote 55:\r\n\r\n  Representations of these hills may be found in the Atlas of Martius\r\n  and in Bates’s “Naturalist on the Amazons.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 56:\r\n\r\n  Afterwards I made a longer stay at Monte Alégre, and learned to know\r\n  its picturesque nooks and dells, where a luxuriant vegetation is\r\n  watered by delicious springs. I feel that the above description is\r\n  superficial; but I let it remain, as perfectly true to my first\r\n  impressions.\r\n\r\nFootnote 57:\r\n\r\n  I soon became convinced after leaving Pará that the faunæ of our\r\n  different stations were not repetitions of each other. On the\r\n  contrary, at Breves, Tajapurú, Gurupá,—in short, at each\r\n  stopping-place, as has been seen,—we found another set of inhabitants\r\n  in the river, if not wholly different from the last, at least\r\n  presenting so many new species that the combination was no longer the\r\n  same. It became at once very important to ascertain whether these\r\n  differences were permanent and stationary, or were, in part at least,\r\n  an effect of migration. I therefore determined to distribute our\r\n  forces in such a way as to keep collecting parties at distant points,\r\n  and to repeat collections from the same localities at different\r\n  seasons. I pursued this method of investigation during our whole stay\r\n  in the Amazons, dividing the party for the first time at Santarem,\r\n  where Messrs. Dexter, James, and Talisman separated from us to ascend\r\n  the Tapajoz, while Mr. Bourget remained at Santarem, and I, with the\r\n  rest of my companions, kept on to Obydos and Villa Bella.—L. A.\r\n\r\nFootnote 58:\r\n\r\n  I was especially interested in seeing living Gymnotini. I do not here\r\n  allude to the electric Gymnotus, already so fully described by\r\n  Humboldt that nothing remains to be said about it; but to the smaller\r\n  representatives of that curious family, known as Carapus, Sternopygus,\r\n  Sternarchus and Rhamphichthys. The Carapus, called Sarapos throughout\r\n  Brazil, are very numerous, and the most lively of the whole group.\r\n  Their motions are winding and rapid like those of the Eel, but yet\r\n  different, inasmuch as they do not glide quickly forward, but, like\r\n  Cobitis and Petromyzon, turn frequent somersets and change their\r\n  direction constantly. This is also the case with the Sternopygus and\r\n  Sternarchus, and even the larger and more slender Rhamphichthys have a\r\n  kind of rolling motion. Though I had expected to find many\r\n  Cyprinodonts, yet their great variety astonished me, and still more\r\n  was I struck by their resemblance to Melanura, Umbra, and the\r\n  Erythrinoids. The presence of Belone and allied forms also surprised\r\n  me. Our stay on the shores of José Assú and Lago Maximo was\r\n  particularly instructive on account of the numerous specimens of each\r\n  species daily brought in by Laudigári and Maia. It afforded me a\r\n  welcome opportunity for studying the differences exhibited by these\r\n  fishes at different periods of life. No type passes, in that respect,\r\n  through greater changes than the Chromides, and among them the genus\r\n  Cychla is perhaps the most variable. I am sure that no ichthyologist\r\n  could at first sight believe that their young are really the early\r\n  stage of the forms known in our ichthyological works as Cychla\r\n  monocolus, Cychla temensis, and Cychla saxatilis. The males and\r\n  females also vary greatly during the spawning season, and the hump on\r\n  the top of the head described as a specific character in Cychla\r\n  nigro-maculata is a protuberance only found in the male, swelling\r\n  during the period of spawning and soon disappearing. Once familiar\r\n  with the young brood of some species of Chromides, it became easy for\r\n  me to distinguish a great variety of small types, no doubt hitherto\r\n  overlooked by naturalists travelling in this region, simply under the\r\n  impression that they must be the young of larger species. A similar\r\n  investigation of the young of Serrasalmo, Myletes, Tetragonopterus,\r\n  Cynodon, Anodus, &c. led me to the discovery of an equally large\r\n  number of diminutive types of Characines, many of which, when full\r\n  grown, do not exceed one inch in length; among them are some of the\r\n  most beautiful fishes I have ever seen, so far as the brilliancy and\r\n  variety of their colors are concerned. Thus everything contributed to\r\n  swell the collections,—the localities selected as well as the mode of\r\n  investigating. I should add here, that, several years before my own\r\n  journey on the Amazons, I had been indebted to the Rev. Mr. Fletcher\r\n  for a valuable collection of fishes from this and other Amazonian\r\n  localities. The familiarity thus obtained with them was very useful to\r\n  me in pursuing my studies on the spot.—L.

Yesterday morning we entered the Rio Negro and\r\nsaw the meeting of its calm, black waters with the rushing yellow\r\ncurrent of the Amazons, or the Solimoens, as the Upper Amazon is called.\r\nThey are well named by the Indians the “living and the dead river,” for\r\nthe Solimoens pours itself down upon the dark stream of the Rio Negro\r\nwith such a vital, resistless force, that the latter does indeed seem\r\nlike a lifeless thing by its side. It is true, that at this season, when\r\nthe water in both the rivers is beginning to subside, the Rio Negro\r\nseems to offer some slight resistance to the stronger river; it\r\nstruggles for a moment with the impetuous flood which overmasters it,\r\nand, though crowded up against the shore, continues its course for a\r\nlittle distance side by side with the Solimoens. But at the season when\r\nthe waters are highest, the latter closes the mouth of the Rio Negro so\r\ncompletely that not a drop of its inky stream is seen to mingle with the\r\nyellow waters outside. It is supposed that at this season the Rio Negro\r\nsinks at once under the Solimoens; at all events, the latter flows\r\nacross its mouth, seeming to bar it completely. It must not be supposed,\r\nfrom the change of name, that the Solimoens is anything more than the\r\ncontinuation of the Amazons; just as the so-called river Marañon is its\r\ncontinuation above Nauta, after crossing the Brazilian frontier. It is\r\nalways the same gigantic stream, traversing the continent for its whole\r\nbreadth; but it has received in its lower, middle, and upper course the\r\nthree local names of the Amazons, the Solimoens, and the Marañon. At the\r\npoint where the Brazilians give it the name of Solimoens it takes a\r\nsudden turn to the south, just where the Rio Negro enters it from the\r\nnorth, so that the two form a sharp angle.\r\n\r\nWe landed at Manaos and went at once to the house which Major Coutinho,\r\nwith his usual foresight, has provided for us. As the day of our arrival\r\nwas uncertain, the arrangements were not completed, and the house was\r\nentirely empty when we entered it. In about ten minutes, however, chairs\r\nand tables—brought, I believe, from the house of a friend—made their\r\nappearance, the rooms were promptly furnished, and presently assumed a\r\nvery cosey and comfortable look, notwithstanding their brick floors and\r\nbare walls. We have some pleasant neighbors in a family living almost\r\nnext door to us, old and intimate friends of Major Coutinho, who receive\r\nus for his sake as if we also had a claim on their affection. Here we\r\nrest from our wanderings, for a week at least, until the steamer sails\r\nfor Tabatinga.\r\n\r\n_September 9th._—We have passed such quiet days here, so far as any\r\nvariety of incident is concerned, that there is little to record. Work\r\nhas gone on as usual; the whole collection of fishes, made since we left\r\nPará, has been so repacked as to leave it in readiness to be shipped for\r\nthat port. Our companions have rejoined us on their return from the\r\nTapajoz, bringing with them considerable collections from that river\r\nalso. They seem to have enjoyed their excursion greatly, and describe\r\nthe river as scarcely inferior to the Amazons itself in breadth and\r\ngrandeur, having wide sand-beaches where the waves roll in, when the\r\nwind is high, almost as upon a sea-shore. Mr. Agassiz has done nothing\r\nin the way of collecting here, with the exception of securing such\r\nfishes as are to be had in the immediate neighborhood; he reserves his\r\nvoyage on the Rio Negro for our return. And, by the way, we are met here\r\nby another practical evidence of the good-will of the Brazilian\r\ngovernment. On leaving Rio, the Emperor had offered Mr. Agassiz the use\r\nof a small government steamer to make explorations on the Negro and\r\nMadeira rivers. On our arrival at Pará he was told that the steamer had\r\nbeen found to be so much out of repair that she was considered unsafe.\r\nUnder these circumstances, he supposed that we should be obliged to\r\nresort to the small boats generally used. But to-day an official\r\ncommunication informs him that, as the Piraja is found not to be\r\nserviceable, another steamer will be furnished, which will meet us at\r\nManaos on our return from the Upper Amazons. The following letter,\r\nacknowledging this favor, to the President of Pará, through whom it was\r\nreceived, contains some account of the scientific results thus far, and\r\nmay not be uninteresting.\r\n\r\n                                            MANAOS, 8 Septembre, 1865.\r\n\r\n  _A Son Excellence M. Couto de Magalhaēs, Président du Pará._\r\n\r\n  MON CHER MONSIEUR:—Je vous remercie infiniment de l’aimable lettre\r\n  que vous avez eu la bonté de m’écrire la semaine dernière et je\r\n  m’empresse de vous faire part des succès extraordinaires qui\r\n  continuent à couronner nos efforts. Il est certain dès-à-présent que\r\n  le nombre des poissons qui peuplent l’Amazone excède de beaucoup\r\n  tout ce que l’on avait imaginé jusqu’ici et que leur distribution\r\n  est très limitée en totalité, bien qu’il y ait un petit nombre\r\n  d’espèces qui nous suivent depuis Pará et d’autres pour une étendue\r\n  plus ou moins considérable. Vous vous rappelez peut-être qu’en\r\n  faisant allusion à mes espérances je vous dis un jour que je croyais\r\n  à la possibilité de trouver deux cent cinquante à trois cents\r\n  espèces de poissons dans tout le bassin de l’Amazone; et bien\r\n  aujourd’hui, même avant d’avoir franchi le tiers du cours principal\r\n  du fleuve et remonté par ci par là seulement quelques lieues au delà\r\n  de ses bords j’en ai déjà obtenu plus de trois cents. C’est inouï;\r\n  surtout si l’on considère que le nombre total connu des naturalistes\r\n  ne va pas au tiers de ce que j’ai déjà recueilli. Ce résultat laisse\r\n  à peine entrevoir ce qu’on découvrira un jour lorsqu’on explorera\r\n  avec le même soin tous les affluents du grand fleuve. Ce serait une\r\n  entreprise digne de vous de faire explorer l’Araguay dans tout son\r\n  cours pour nous apprendre combien d’assemblages differents d’espèces\r\n  distinctes se rencontrent successivement depuis ses sources jusqu’à\r\n  sa jonction avec le Tocantins et plus bas jusqu’à l’Amazone. Vous\r\n  avez déjà une sorte de propriété scientifique sur ce fleuve à\r\n  laquelle vous ajouteriez de nouveaux droits en fournissant à la\r\n  science ces renseignements.\r\n\r\n  Permettez moi de vous exprimer toute ma gratitude pour l’intérêt que\r\n  vous prenez à mon jeune compagnon de voyage. M. Ward le mérite\r\n  également par sa grande jeunesse, son courage et son dévouement à la\r\n  science. M. Epaminondas vient de me faire part de vos généreuses\r\n  intentions à mon égard et de me dire que vous vous proposez\r\n  d’expédier un vapeur à Manaos pour prendre la place du Piraja et\r\n  faciliter notre exploration du Rio Negro et du Rio Madeira. Je ne\r\n  sais trop comment vous remercier pour une pareille faveur; tout ce\r\n  que je puis vous dire dès-à-présent c’est que cette faveur me\r\n  permettra de faire une exploration de ces fleuves qui me serait\r\n  impossible sans cela. Et si le résultat de ces recherches est aussi\r\n  favorable que je l’attends, l’honneur en reviendra avant tout à la\r\n  libéralité du gouvernement Brésilien. Entraîné par les résultats que\r\n  j’ai obtenus jusqu’ici, je pense que si les circonstances nous sont\r\n  favorables en arrivant à Tabatinga, nous ferons une poussée jusque\r\n  dans la partie inférieure du Pérou[59] tandis que mes compagnons\r\n  exploreront les fleuves intermédiaires entre cette ville et Teffé;\r\n  en sorte que nous ne serons probablement pas de retour à Manaos\r\n  avant la fin du mois d’Octobre.\r\n\r\n  Agréez, mon cher Monsieur, l’assurance de ma haute consideration et\r\n  de mon parfait dévouement.\r\n\r\n                                                       L. AGASSIZ.[60]\r\n\r\nThere is little to be said of the town of Manaos. It consists of a small\r\ncollection of houses, half of which seem going to decay, and indeed one\r\ncan hardly help smiling at the tumble-down edifices, dignified by the\r\nname of public buildings, the treasury, the legislative hall, the\r\npost-office, the custom-house, the President’s mansion, &c. The position\r\nof the city, however, at the junction of the Rio Negro, the Amazons, and\r\nthe Solimoens, is commanding; and, insignificant as it looks at present,\r\nManaos will no doubt be a great centre of commerce and navigation at\r\nsome future time.[61]\r\n\r\nBut when we consider the vast extent of land covered by almost\r\nimpenetrable forest and the great practical difficulties in the way of\r\nthe settler here, arising from the climate, the insects, the obstacles\r\nto communication, the day seems yet far distant when a numerous\r\npopulation will cover the banks of the Amazons, when steamers will ply\r\nbetween its ports as between those of the Mississippi, and when all\r\nnations will share in the rich products of its valley.[62] One of my\r\ngreatest pleasures in Manaos has been to walk toward the neighboring\r\nforest at nightfall, and see the water-carriers, Indian and negro,\r\ncoming down from the narrow pathways with their great red earthen jars\r\non their heads. They make quite a procession at morning and evening; for\r\nthe river water is not considered good, and the town is chiefly supplied\r\nfrom pools and little streamlets in the woods. Many of these pools, very\r\nprettily situated and embowered in trees, are used as bathing-places;\r\none, which is quite large and deep, is a special favorite; it has been\r\nthatched over with palm, and has also a little thatched shed adjoining,\r\nto serve as a dressing-room.\r\n\r\nYesterday we passed an interesting morning at a school for Indian\r\nchildren a little way out of the city. We were astonished at the aptness\r\nthey showed for the arts of civilization so uncongenial to our North\r\nAmerican Indians: it reminded one that they are the successors, on the\r\nsame soil, of the races who founded the ancient civilizations of Peru\r\nand Mexico, so much beyond any social organization known to have existed\r\namong the more northern tribes. In one room they were turning out very\r\nnice pieces of furniture,—chairs, tables, book-stands, &c., with a\r\nnumber of smaller articles, such as rulers and paper-knives. In another\r\nroom they were working in iron, in another making fine fancy articles of\r\nstraw. Besides these trades, they are taught to read, write, and cipher,\r\nand to play on various musical instruments. For music they are said to\r\nhave, like the negro, a natural aptitude. In the main building were the\r\nschool-rooms, dormitories, store-rooms, kitchen, &c. We were there just\r\nat the breakfast hour, and had the satisfaction of seeing them sit down\r\nto a hearty meal, consisting of a large portion of bread and butter and\r\na generous bowl of coffee. I could not help contrasting the expression\r\nof these boys, when they were all collected, with that of a number of\r\nnegro children assembled together; the latter always so jolly and\r\ncareless, the former shy, serious, almost sombre. They looked, however,\r\nvery intelligent, and we were told that those of pure Indian descent\r\nwere more so than the half-breeds. The school is supported by the\r\nprovince, but the fund is small, and the number of pupils is very\r\nlimited. Our pleasure in this school was somewhat marred by hearing\r\nthat, though it purports to be an orphan asylum, children who have\r\nparents loath to part with them are sometimes taken by force from the\r\nwild Indian tribes to be educated here. The appearance of a dark cell,\r\nbarred up like the cell of a wild animal, which was used as a prison for\r\nrefractory scholars, rather confirmed this impression. Whenever I have\r\nmade inquiries about these reports, I have been answered, that, if such\r\ncases occur, it is only where children are taken from an utterly savage\r\nand degraded condition, and that it is better they should be civilized\r\nby main force than not civilized at all. It may be doubted, however,\r\nwhether any providence but the providence of God is so wise and so\r\nloving that it may safely exercise a compulsory charity. Speaking of the\r\neducation of the Indians reminds me that we have been fortunate enough\r\nto meet a French padre here who has furnished Mr. Agassiz with a package\r\nof simple elementary Portuguese books, which he has already sent to our\r\nliterary Indian friend, José Maia. This kind priest offers also to take\r\nthe boy, for whom Maia was so anxious to secure an education, into the\r\nseminary of which he is director, and where he receives charity\r\nscholars.\r\n\r\n_September 12th._—On Sunday we left Manaos in the steamer for Tabatinga,\r\nand are again on our way up the river. I insert here a letter which\r\ngives a sort of _résumé_ of the scientific work up to this moment, and\r\nshows also how constantly we were attended by the good-will of the\r\nemployés on the Amazonian line of steamers, and that of their excellent\r\ndirector, Mr. Pimenta Bueno.\r\n\r\n                                            MANAOS, 8 Septembre, 1865.\r\n\r\n  _Senhor Pimenta Bueno._\r\n\r\n  MON CHER AMI:—Vous serez probablement surpris de recevoir seulement\r\n  quelques lignes de moi après le temps qui s’est écoulé depuis ma\r\n  dernière lettre. Le fait est que depuis Obydos je suis allé de\r\n  surprise en surprise et que j’ai à peine eu le temps de prendre soin\r\n  des collections que nous avons faites, sans pouvoir les étudier\r\n  convenablement. C’est ainsi que pendant le semaine que nous avons\r\n  passée dans les environs de Villa Bella, au Lago José Assú et Lago\r\n  Maximo, nous avons recueilli cent quatre-vingts espèces de poissons\r\n  dont les deux tiers au moins sont nouvelles et ceux de mes\r\n  compagnons qui sont restés à Santarem et dans le Tapajoz en ont\r\n  rapporté une cinquantaine, ce qui fait déjà bien au delà de trois\r\n  cents espèces en comptant celles de Porto do Moz, de Gurupá, de\r\n  Tajapurú et de Monte Alégre. Vous voyez qu’avant même d’avoir\r\n  parcouru le tiers du cours de l’Amazone, le nombre des poissons est\r\n  plus du triple de celui de toutes les espèces connues jusqu’à ce\r\n  jour, et je commence à m’apercevoir que nous ne ferons qu’effleurer\r\n  la surface du centre de ce grand bassin. Que sera-ce lorsqu’on\r\n  pourra étudier à loisir et dans l’époque la plus favorable tous ses\r\n  affluents. Aussi je prends dès-à-présent la résolution de faire de\r\n  plus nombreuses stations dans la partie supérieure du fleuve et de\r\n  prolonger mon séjour aussi long-temps que mes forces me le\r\n  permettront. Ne croyez pas cependant que j’oublie à qui je dois un\r\n  pareil succès. C’est vous qui m’avez mis sur la voie en me faisant\r\n  connaître les ressources de la fôret et mieux encore en me\r\n  fournissant les moyens d’en tirer parti. Merci, mille fois, merci.\r\n  Je dois aussi tenir grand compte de l’assistance que m’ont fournie\r\n  les agents de la compagnie sur tous les points où nous avons touché.\r\n  Notre aimable commandant s’est également évertué, et pendant que\r\n  j’explorais les lacs des environs de Villa Bella il a fait lui-même\r\n  une très belle collection dans l’Amazone même, où il a recueilli de\r\n  nombreuses petites espèces que les pecheurs négligent toujours. A\r\n  l’arrivée du Belem, j’ai reçu votre aimable lettre et une partie de\r\n  l’alcohol que j’avais demandé à M. Bond. Je lui écris aujourd’hui\r\n  pour qu’il m’en envoie encore une partie à Teffé et plus tard\r\n  davantage à Manaos. Je vous remercie pour le catalogue des poissons\r\n  du Pará; je vous le restituerai à notre retour, avec les additions\r\n  que je ferai pendant le reste du voyage. Adieu, mon cher ami.\r\n\r\n                                             Tout à vous,\r\n\r\n                                                       L. AGASSIZ.[63]\r\n\r\nAlthough no longer on board an independent steamer, we are still the\r\nguests of the company, having government passages. Nothing can be more\r\ncomfortable than the travelling on these Amazonian boats. They are clean\r\nand well kept, with good-sized state-rooms, which most persons use,\r\nhowever, only as dressing-rooms, since it is always more agreeable to\r\nsleep on the open deck in one’s hammock. The table is very well kept,\r\nthe fare good, though not varied. Bread is the greatest deficiency, but\r\nhard biscuit makes a tolerable substitute. Our life is after this\r\nfashion. We turn out of our hammocks at dawn, go down stairs to make our\r\ntoilets, and have a cup of hot coffee below. By this time the decks are\r\ngenerally washed and dried, the hammocks removed, and we can go above\r\nagain. Between then and the breakfast hour, at half past ten o’clock, I\r\ngenerally study Portuguese, though my lessons are somewhat interrupted\r\nby watching the shore and the trees, a constant temptation when we are\r\ncoasting along near the banks. At half past ten or eleven o’clock\r\nbreakfast is served, and after that the glare of the sun becomes trying,\r\nand I usually descend to the cabin, where we make up our journals, and\r\nwrite during the middle of the day. At three o’clock I consider that the\r\nworking hours are over, and then I take a book and sit in my\r\nlounging-chair on deck, and watch the scenery, and the birds and the\r\nturtles, and the alligators if there are any, and am lazy in a general\r\nway. At five o’clock dinner is served, (the meals being always on deck,)\r\nand after that begins the delight of the day. At that hour it grows\r\ndeliciously cool, the sunsets are always beautiful, and we go to the\r\nforward deck and sit there till nine o’clock in the evening. Then comes\r\ntea, and then to our hammocks; I sleep in mine most profoundly till\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nTo-day we stopped at a small station on the north side of the river\r\ncalled Barreira das Cudajas. The few houses stand on a bank of red\r\ndrift, slightly stratified in some parts, and affording a support for\r\nthe river-mud, shored up against it. Since then, in our progress, we\r\nhave seen the same formation in several localities.\r\n\r\n_September 13th._—This morning the steamer dropped anchor at the little\r\ntown of Coari on the Coari River,—one of the rivers of black water. We\r\nwere detained at this place for some hours, taking in wood; so slow a\r\nprocess here, that an American, accustomed to the rapid methods of work\r\nat home, looks on in incredulous astonishment. A crazy old canoe, with\r\nits load of wood, creeps out from the shore, the slowness of its advance\r\naccounted for by the fact that of its two rowers one has a broken\r\npaddle, the other a long stick, to serve as apologies for oars. When the\r\nboat reaches the side of the steamer, a line of men is formed some eight\r\nor ten in number, and the wood is passed from hand to hand, log by log,\r\neach log counted as it arrives. Mr. Agassiz timed them this morning, and\r\nfound that they averaged about seven logs a minute. Under these\r\ncircumstances, one can understand that stopping to wood is a long\r\naffair. Since we left Coari we have been coasting along close to the\r\nland, the continental shore, and not that of an island. The islands are\r\nso large and numerous in the Amazons, that often when we believe\r\nourselves between the northern and southern margins of the river, we are\r\nin fact between island shores. We have followed the drift almost\r\nconstantly to-day,—the same red drift with which we have become so\r\nfamiliar in South America. Sometimes it rises in cliffs and banks above\r\nthe mud deposit, sometimes it crops out through the mud, occasionally\r\nmingling with it and partially stratified, and in one locality it\r\noverlaid a gray rock in place, the nature of which Mr. Agassiz could not\r\ndetermine, but which was distinctly stratified and slightly tilted. The\r\ndrift is certainly more conspicuous as we ascend the river; is this\r\nbecause we approach its source, or because the nature of the vegetation\r\nallows us to see more of the soil? Since we left Manaos the forest has\r\nbeen less luxuriant; it is lower on the Solimoens than on the Amazons,\r\nmore ragged and more open. The palms are also less numerous than\r\nhitherto, but there is a tree here which rivals them in dignity. Its\r\nflat dome, rounded but not conical, towers above the forest, and, when\r\nseen from a distance, has an almost architectural character, so regular\r\nis its form. This majestic tree, called the Sumaumeira (Eriodendron\r\nSumauma), is one of the few trees in this climate which shed their\r\nleaves periodically, and now it lifts its broad rounded summit above the\r\ngreen mass of vegetation around it, quite bare of foliage. Symmetrical\r\nas it is, the branches are greatly ramified and very knotty. The bark is\r\nwhite. It would seem that the season approaches when the Sumaumeiras\r\nshould take on their green garb again, for a few are already beginning\r\nto put out young leaves. Beside this giant of the forest, the Imbauba\r\n(Cecropia), much lower here, however, than in Southern Brazil, and the\r\nTaxi, with its white flowers and brown buds, are very conspicuous along\r\nthe banks. Close upon the shore the arrow-grass, some five or six feet\r\nin height, grows in quantity; it is called “frexas” here, being used by\r\nthe Indians to make their arrows.\r\n\r\n_September 14th._—For the last day or two the shore has been higher than\r\nwe have seen it since leaving Manaos. We constantly pass cliffs of red\r\ndrift with a shallow beach of mud deposit resting against them; not\r\ninfrequently a gray rock, somewhat like clay slate, crops out below the\r\ndrift; this rock is very distinctly stratified, tilting sometimes to the\r\nwest, sometimes to the east, always unconformable with the overlying\r\ndrift.[64] The color of the drift changes occasionally, being sometimes\r\nnearly white in this neighborhood instead of red. We are coming now to\r\nthat part of the Amazons where the wide sand-beaches occur, the\r\nbreeding-places of the turtles and alligators. It is not yet quite the\r\nseason for gathering the turtle-eggs, making the turtle-butter, &c., but\r\nwe frequently see the Indian huts on the beaches, and their stakes set\r\nup for spreading and drying fish, which is one of the great articles of\r\ncommerce here. This morning we have passed several hours off the town of\r\nEga, or Teffé as the Brazilians call it. It takes its name from the\r\nriver Teffé, but the town itself stands on a small lake, formed by the\r\nriver just before it joins the Amazons. The entrance to the lake, which\r\nis broken by a number of little channels or igarapés, and the approach\r\nto the town, are exceedingly pretty. The town itself, with a wide beach\r\nin front, standing on the slope of a green hill, where sheep and cattle,\r\na rare sight in this region, are grazing, looks very inviting. We\r\nexamined it with interest, for some of the party at least will return to\r\nthis station for the purpose of making collections.\r\n\r\n_September 15th._—For the last two or three days we have been holding\r\nfrequent discussions as to the best disposition of our forces after\r\nreaching Tabatinga;—a source of great anxiety to Mr. Agassiz, the time\r\nwe have to spend being so short, and the subjects of investigation so\r\nvarious and so important. Should he give up the idea of continuing, in\r\nperson, his study of the fishes in the upper Amazons, leaving only some\r\nparties to make collections, and going himself into Peru, to visit at\r\nleast the first spur of the Andes, with the purpose of ascertaining\r\nwhether any vestiges of glaciers are to be found in the valleys, and\r\nalso of making a collection of fishes from the mountain streams; or\r\nshould he renounce the journey into Peru for the present, and, making a\r\nstation somewhere in this region for the next month or two, complete, as\r\nfar as may be, his investigation of the distribution and development of\r\nfishes in the Solimoens? Had the result of the Peruvian journey been\r\nmore certain, the decision would have been easier; but it is more than\r\nlikely that the torrential rains of this latitude have decomposed the\r\nsurface and swept away all traces of glaciers, if they ever existed at\r\nso low a level. To go on, therefore, seemed a little like giving up a\r\ncertain for an uncertain result. Earnestly desirous of making the best\r\nuse of his time and opportunities here, this doubt has disturbed Mr.\r\nAgassiz’s waking and sleeping thoughts for several days past. Yesterday\r\nmorning, at Teffé, a most unexpected adviser appeared in the midst of\r\nour council of war. Insignificant in size, this individual,\r\nnevertheless, brought great weight to the decision. The intruder was a\r\nsmall fish with his mouth full of young ones. The practical plea was\r\nirresistible,—embryology carried the day. A chance of investigating so\r\nextraordinary a process of development, not only in this species but in\r\nseveral others said to rear their young in the same fashion, was not to\r\nbe thrown away; and, besides, there was the prospect of making a\r\ncollection and a series of colored drawings, from the life, of the\r\nimmense variety of fishes in the river and lake of Teffé, and perhaps of\r\nstudying the embryology of the turtles and alligators in their breeding\r\nseason. Mr. Agassiz, therefore, decides to return to Teffé with his\r\nartist and two or three other assistants, and to make a station there\r\nfor a month at least, leaving Mr. Bourget, with our Indian fisherman, at\r\nTabatinga to collect in that region, and sending Mr. James and Mr.\r\nTalisman to the river Putumayo, or Iça, and afterwards to the Hyutahy\r\nfor the same purpose. This dispersion of parties to collect\r\nsimultaneously in different areas, divided from each other by\r\nconsiderable distances, will show how the fishes are distributed, and\r\nwhether their combinations differ in these localities as they have been\r\nfound to do in the Lower Amazons.\r\n\r\nI insert here a letter to the Emperor on the subject of this curious\r\nfish, which happened to be one which Mr. Agassiz had formerly dedicated\r\nto him.\r\n\r\n                                            TEFFÉ, 14 Septembre, 1865.\r\n\r\n  SIRE:—En arrivant ici ce matin j’ai eu la surprise la plus agréable\r\n  et la plus inattendue. Le premier poisson qui me fut apporté était\r\n  l’Acara que votre Majesté a bien voulu me permettre de lui dédier et\r\n  par un bonheur inouï c’était l’époque de la ponte et il avait la\r\n  bouche pleine de petits vivants, en voie de développement. Voilà\r\n  donc le fait le plus incroyable en embryologie pleinement confirmé,\r\n  et il ne me reste plus qu’à étudier en detail et à loisir tous les\r\n  changements que subissent ces petits jusqu’au moment où ils quittent\r\n  leur singulier nid, afin que je puisse publier un récit complet de\r\n  cette singulière histoire. Mes prévisions sur la distribution des\r\n  poissons se confirment; le fleuve est habité par plusieurs faunes\r\n  ichthyologiques très distinctes, qui n’ont pour lien commun qu’un\r\n  très petit nombre d’espèces qu’on rencontre partout. Il reste\r\n  maintenant à préciser les limites de ces régions ichthyologiques et\r\n  peut-être me laisserai-je entraîner à consacrer quelque temps à\r\n  cette étude, si je trouve les moyens d’y parvenir. Il y a maintenant\r\n  une question qui devient fort intéressante, c’est de savoir jusqu’à\r\n  quel point le même phénomène se reproduit dans chacun des grands\r\n  affluents du Rio Amazonas, ou en d’autres termes si les poissons des\r\n  régions supérieures du Rio Madeira et du Rio Negro, etc., etc., sont\r\n  les mêmes que ceux du cours inférieur de ces fleuves. Quant à la\r\n  diversité même des poissons du bassin tout entier mes prévisions\r\n  sont de beaucoup dépassées. Avant d’arriver à Manaos j’avais déjà\r\n  recueilli plus de trois cents espèces, c. à. d. le triple des\r\n  espèces connues jusqu’à ce jour au moins. La moitié environ out pu\r\n  être peintes sur le vivant par M. Burkhardt; en sorte que si je puis\r\n  parvenir à publier tous ces documents, les renseignements que je\r\n  pourrai fournir sur ce sujet dépasseront de beaucoup tout ce que\r\n  l’on a publié jusqu’à ce jour.\r\n\r\n  Je serais bien heureux d’apprendre que Votre Majesté n’a pas\r\n  rencontré de difficultés dans son voyage et qu’Elle a atteint\r\n  pleinement le but qu’Elle se proposait. Nous sommes ici sans\r\n  nouvelles du Sud, depuis que nous avons quitté Rio, et tout ce que\r\n  nous avions appris alors était qu’après une traversée assez orageuse\r\n  votre Majesté avait atteint le Rio Grande. Que Dieu protège et\r\n  bénisse votre Majesté! Avec les sentiments du plus profond respect\r\n  et de la reconnaissance la plus vive,\r\n\r\n  Je suis de votre Majesté\r\n\r\n                   le très humble et très obéissant serviteur,\r\n\r\n                                                       L. AGASSIZ.[65]\r\n\r\nThe character of the banks yesterday and to-day continues unchanged;\r\nthey are rather high, rising now and then in bluffs and presenting the\r\nsame mixture of reddish drift and mud deposit, with the gray, slaty rock\r\nbelow, cropping out occasionally. This morning we are stopping to wood\r\nat a station opposite the village of Fonte Bôa. Here Mr. Agassiz has had\r\nan opportunity of going on shore and examining this formation. He finds\r\na thick bed of ferruginous sandstone underlying a number of thinner beds\r\nof mud clay, resembling old clay slate with cleavage. These beds are\r\noverlaid by a bank of ochre-colored sandy clay (designated as drift\r\nabove), with hardly any signs of stratification. Yesterday we passed\r\nseveral lakes, shut out from the river by mud-bars, and seemingly\r\nhaunted by waterfowl. In one we saw immense flocks of what looked at\r\nthat distance either like red Ibises or red spoonbills, and also numbers\r\nof gulls. Our sportsmen looked longingly at them, and are impatient for\r\nthe time when we shall be settled on land, and they can begin to make\r\nhavoc among the birds.\r\n\r\n_September 17th._—Last evening we took in wood from the shore some miles\r\nbelow the town of Tonantins. I sat watching the Indians on the bank, of\r\nwhom there were some fifteen or twenty, men, women, and children; the\r\nmen loading the wood, the women and children being there apparently to\r\nlook on. They had built a fire on the bank, and hung their nets or\r\ncotton tents, under which they sleep, on the trees behind. They made a\r\nwild group, passing to and fro in the light of the fire, the care of\r\nwhich seemed the special charge of a tall, gaunt, weird-looking woman,\r\nwho would have made a good Meg Merrilies. She seemed to have but one\r\ngarment,—a long, brown, stuff robe, girt round the waist; as she strode\r\nabout the fire, throwing on fresh logs and stirring the dying embers,\r\nthe flames blazed up in her face, lighting her tawny skin and long,\r\nunkempt hair, flickering over the figures of women and children about\r\nher, and shedding a warm glow over the forest which made the setting to\r\nthe picture. This is the only very tall Indian woman I have seen;\r\nusually the women are rather short of stature. When the Indians had made\r\ntheir preparations for the night, they heaped damp fuel on the fire till\r\nit smouldered down and threw out thick clouds of smoke, enveloping the\r\nsleeping-tents, and no doubt driving off effectually the clouds of\r\nmosquitoes, from which the natives seem as great sufferers as strangers.\r\nThese upper stations on the Amazons are haunted by swarms of mosquitoes\r\nat night, and during the day by a little biting fly called Pium, no less\r\nannoying.\r\n\r\n_September 18th._—Another pause last evening at the village of San\r\nPaolo, standing on a ridge which rises quite steeply from the river and\r\nsinks again into a ravine behind. Throughout all this region the banks\r\nare eaten away by the river, large portions falling into the water at a\r\ntime, and carrying the trees with them. These land-slides are so\r\nfrequent and so extensive as to make travelling along the banks in small\r\nboats quite dangerous. The scenery of the Solimoens is by no means so\r\ninteresting as that of the Lower Amazons. The banks are ragged and\r\nbroken, the forest lower, less luxuriant, and the palm growth very\r\nfitful. For a day or two past we have scarcely seen any palms. One kind\r\nseems common, however, namely, the Paxiuba Barriguda—Pa-shee-oo-ba\r\n(Iriartea ventricosa), a species not unlike the Assai in dignity of\r\nport, but remarkable for the swelling of its stem at half height, giving\r\nit a sort of spindle shape. The cut of the foliage is peculiar also,\r\neach leaflet being wedge-shaped. The steamer is often now between the\r\nshores of the river itself instead of coasting along by the many lovely\r\nislands which make the voyage between Pará and Manaos so diversified;\r\nwhat is thus gained in dimensions is lost in picturesqueness of detail.\r\nThen the element of human life and habitations is utterly wanting; one\r\noften travels for a day without meeting even so much as a hut. But if\r\nmen are not to be seen, animals are certainly plenty; as our steamer\r\npuffs along, great flocks of birds rise up from the shore, turtles pop\r\ntheir black noses out of the water, alligators show themselves\r\noccasionally, and sometimes a troop of brown Capivari scuttles up the\r\nbank, taking refuge in the trees at our approach. To-morrow morning we\r\nreach Tabatinga, and touch the farthest point of our journey.\r\n\r\n_September 20th._—On Monday evening we arrived at Tabatinga, remaining\r\nthere till Wednesday morning to discharge the cargo,—a lengthy process,\r\nwith the Brazilian method of working. Tabatinga is the frontier town\r\nbetween Brazil and Peru, and is dignified by the name of a military\r\nstation, though when one looks at the two or three small mounted guns on\r\nthe bank, the mud house behind them constituting barracks, with half a\r\ndozen soldiers lounging in front of it, one cannot but think that the\r\nfortification is not a very formidable one.[66] The town itself standing\r\non a mud bluff, deeply ravined and cracked in many directions, consists\r\nof some dozen ruinous houses built around an open square. Of the\r\ninhabitants I saw but little, for it was toward evening when I went on\r\nshore, and they were already driven under shelter by the mosquitoes. One\r\nor two looked out from their doors and gave me a friendly warning not to\r\nproceed unless I was prepared to be devoured, and indeed the buzzing\r\nswarm about me soon drove me back to the steamer. The mosquitoes by\r\nnight and the Piums by day are said to render life almost intolerable\r\nhere. Under these circumstances we could form little idea of the\r\ncharacter of the vegetation in our short stay. But we made the\r\nacquaintance of one curious palm, the Tucum, a species of Astrocaryum,\r\nthe fibre of which makes an excellent material for weaving hammocks,\r\nfishing-nets, and the like. It is gradually becoming an important\r\narticle of commerce. The approach to Tabatinga, with two or three\r\nislands in the neighborhood, numerous igarapés opening out of the river,\r\nand the Hyavary emptying into it, is, however, one of the prettiest\r\nparts of the Solimoens. We found here four members of a Spanish\r\nscientific commission, who have been travelling several years in South\r\nand Central America, and whose track we have crossed several times\r\nwithout meeting them. They welcomed the arrival of the steamer with\r\ndelight, having awaited their release at Tabatinga for two or three\r\nweeks. The party consisted of Drs. Almagro, Spada, Martinez, and Isern.\r\nThey had just accomplished an adventurous journey, having descended the\r\nNapo on a raft, which their large collection of live animals had turned\r\ninto a sort of Noah’s ark. After various risks and exposures they had\r\narrived at Tabatinga, having lost almost all their clothing, except what\r\nthey wore, by shipwreck. Fortunately, their papers and collections were\r\nsaved.[67] We are now on our way down the river again, having left Mr.\r\nBourget at Tabatinga to pass a month in making collections in that\r\nregion, and dropped Mr. James and Mr. Talisman last evening at San\r\nPaolo, where they are to get a canoe and Indians for their further\r\njourney to the Iça. This morning, while stopping to wood at Fonte Bôa,\r\nMr. Agassiz went on shore and collected a very interesting series of\r\nfossil plants in the lower mud deposit; he was also very successful in\r\nmaking a small collection of fishes, containing several new species,\r\nduring the few hours we passed at this place.\r\n\r\n_September 25th._—Teffé. On Friday, the day after my last date, we were\r\nwithin two or three hours of Teffé; we had just finished packing our\r\nvarious effects, and were closing our letters to be mailed from Manaos,\r\nwhen the steamer came to a sudden pause with that dead, sullen,\r\ninstantaneous stop which means mischief. The order to reverse the\r\nengines was given instantly, but we had driven with all our force into\r\nthe bed of the river, and there we remained, motionless. This is\r\nsometimes rather a serious accident at the season when the waters are\r\nfalling, steamers having been occasionally stranded for a number of\r\nweeks. It is not easily guarded against, the river bottom changing so\r\nconstantly and so suddenly that even the most experienced pilots cannot\r\nalways avoid disaster. They may pass with perfect safety in their upward\r\nvoyage over a place where, on their return, they find a formidable bank\r\nof mud. During three hours the crew worked ineffectually, trying to back\r\nthe steamer off, or sinking the anchor at a distance to drag her back\r\nupon it. At five o’clock in the afternoon the sky began to look black\r\nand lowering, and presently a violent squall, with thunder and rain,\r\nbroke upon us. The wind did, in an instant, what man and steam together\r\nhad failed to do in hours. As the squall struck the steamer on her side,\r\nshe vibrated, veered and floated free. There was a general stir of\r\ndelight at this sudden and unexpected liberation, for the delay was\r\nserious to all. One or two of the passengers were merchants, to whom it\r\nwas important to meet the steamer of the 25th at Manaos, which connects\r\nwith other steamers all along the coast; and the members of the Spanish\r\nscientific commission, if they could not at once transfer their effects\r\nto the other steamer, would not only miss the next European steamer, but\r\nmust be at the expense and care of storing their various luggage and\r\nmaintaining their live stock at Manaos for a fortnight. And lastly, to\r\nMr. Agassiz himself it was a serious disappointment to lose two or three\r\ndays out of the precious month for investigations at Teffé. Therefore,\r\nevery face beamed when the kindly shock of the wind set us afloat again;\r\nbut the work, so vainly spent to release us, was but too efficient in\r\nkeeping us prisoners. The anchor, which had been sunk in the mud at some\r\ndistance, was so deeply buried that it was difficult to raise it, and in\r\nthe effort to do so we grounded again. Indeed, environed as we were by\r\nmud and sand, it was no easy matter to find a channel out of them. We\r\nnow remained motionless all night, though the Captain was unremitting in\r\nhis efforts and kept the men at work till morning, when, at about seven\r\no’clock, the boat worked herself free at last, and we thought our\r\ntroubles fairly over. But the old proverb “There’s many a slip ‘twixt\r\nthe cup and the lip” never was truer; on starting once more we found\r\nthat, in the strain and shock to which the ship had been submitted, the\r\nrudder was broken. In view of this new disaster, the passengers for Pará\r\ngave up all hope of meeting the steamer at Manaos, and the rest resigned\r\nthemselves to waiting with such philosophy as they could muster. The\r\nwhole of that day and the following night were spent in rigging up a new\r\nrudder, and it was not until eight o’clock on Sunday morning that we\r\nwere once more on our way, arriving at Teffé at eleven o’clock.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 59:\r\n\r\n  As will be seen hereafter, want of time and the engrossing character\r\n  of his work in the Amazons, compelled Mr. Agassiz to renounce the\r\n  journey into Peru, as also the ascent of the river Madeira.\r\n\r\nFootnote 60:\r\n\r\n  _To His Excellency M. Couto de Magalhaēs, President of Pará._\r\n\r\n  MY DEAR SIR:—I thank you sincerely for the kind letter you were so\r\n  good as to write me last week, and I hasten to inform you of the\r\n  extraordinary success which continues to crown our efforts. It is\r\n  certain from this time forth, that the number of fishes inhabiting the\r\n  Amazons greatly exceeds all that has hitherto been imagined, and that\r\n  their distribution is very limited on the whole, though a small number\r\n  of species have followed us since we left Pará and others have a range\r\n  more or less extensive. You remember, perhaps, that, when alluding to\r\n  my hopes, I told you one day that I believed in the possibility of\r\n  finding from two hundred and fifty to three hundred species of fish in\r\n  the whole basin of the Amazons; even now, having passed over less than\r\n  one third of the main stream, and only diverged here and there to some\r\n  points beyond its shores, I have already obtained more than three\r\n  hundred. It is incredible, above all, if one considers that the total\r\n  number known to naturalists does not reach one third of what I have\r\n  already collected. This result scarcely allows one to foresee the\r\n  discoveries to be made whenever the affluents of the great river are\r\n  explored with the same care. An exploration of the Araguay for its\r\n  whole course, in order to teach us how many different combinations of\r\n  distinct species occur in succession, from its sources to its junction\r\n  with the Tocantins and lower down till it meets the Amazons, would be\r\n  an enterprise worthy of you. You have already a sort of scientific\r\n  property in this river, to which you would add new rights in\r\n  furnishing science with this information.\r\n\r\n  Permit me to express to you all the gratitude I feel for the interest\r\n  you take in my young travelling companion. Mr. Ward is worthy of it,\r\n  alike from his youth, his courage, and his devotion to science. Mr.\r\n  Epaminondas has just communicated to me your generous intentions\r\n  towards myself, and your purpose of sending a steamer to Manaos to\r\n  take the place of the Piraja, and facilitate our exploration of the\r\n  Rio Negro and the Rio Madeira. I do not know how to thank you enough;\r\n  all that I can say is, that this favor will allow me to make an\r\n  exploration of these rivers which would be otherwise impossible. If\r\n  the result of these researches be as favorable as my hopes, the honor\r\n  will be due, in the first instance, to the liberality of the Brazilian\r\n  government. Encouraged by the results thus far obtained, I think that,\r\n  if the circumstances are favorable, on arriving at Tabatinga, we shall\r\n  make a push into the lower part of Peru, while my companions will\r\n  explore the rivers intermediate between this town and Teffé; so that\r\n  we shall probably not return to Manaos before the end of October.\r\n\r\n  Accept, my dear Sir, the assurance of my high regard, &c., &c.\r\n\r\n                                                             L. AGASSIZ.\r\n\r\nFootnote 61:\r\n\r\n  Some English travellers have criticised the position of the town, and\r\n  regretted that it is not placed lower down, at the immediate junction\r\n  of the Rio Negro with the Solimoens. But its actual situation is much\r\n  better, on account of the more quiet port, removed as it is from the\r\n  violent currents caused by the meeting of the two rivers.—L. A.\r\n\r\nFootnote 62:\r\n\r\n  When this was written there was hardly any prospect of the early\r\n  opening of the Amazons to the free commerce of the world. The\r\n  circumstance that since the 7th of September last this great\r\n  fresh-water ocean has been made free to the mercantile shipping of all\r\n  nations will, no doubt, immensely accelerate the development of\r\n  civilization in these desert regions. No act could have exhibited more\r\n  unequivocally the liberal policy which actuates the Brazilian\r\n  government than this. To complete the great work, two things are still\r\n  wanting,—a direct high road between the upper tributaries of the Rio\r\n  Madeira and Rio Paraguay, and the abolition of the subsidies granted\r\n  to privileged companies, that the colossal traffic of which the whole\r\n  basin is susceptible may truly be thrown open to a fair\r\n  competition.—L. A.\r\n\r\nFootnote 63:\r\n\r\n  _Senahor Pimenta Bueno._\r\n\r\n  MY DEAR FRIEND:—You will probably be surprised to receive only a few\r\n  lines from me after the time which has elapsed since my last letter.\r\n  The truth is, that, since Obydos, I have passed from surprise to\r\n  surprise, and that I have scarcely had time to take care of the\r\n  collections we have made, without being able to study them properly.\r\n  Thus, during the week we spent in the environs of Villa Bella, at Lago\r\n  José Assú and Lago Maximo, we have collected one hundred and eighty\r\n  species of fishes, two thirds of which, at least, are new, while those\r\n  of my companions who remained at Santarem and upon the Tapajoz have\r\n  brought back some fifty more, making already more than three hundred\r\n  species, including those of Porto do Moz, of Gurupá, of Tajapurú, and\r\n  of Monte Alégre. You see that before having ascended the Amazons for\r\n  one third of its course, the number of fishes is more than triple that\r\n  of all the species known thus far, and I begin to perceive that we\r\n  shall not do more than skim over the surface of the centre of this\r\n  great basin. What will it be when it becomes possible to study all its\r\n  affluents at leisure and in the most favorable season! I have resolved\r\n  to make more numerous stations in the upper part of the river and to\r\n  stay as long as my strength and means will allow. Do not think,\r\n  however, that I forget to whom I owe such a success. It is you who\r\n  have put me on the path, by making known to me the resources of the\r\n  forest, and, better still, by furnishing me with the means to profit\r\n  by them. Thanks, a thousand times, thanks. I ought also to acknowledge\r\n  the assistance afforded me by the agents of the Company, at all the\r\n  points where we have touched. Our amiable commander has also exerted\r\n  himself, and while I explored the lakes in the neighborhood of Villa\r\n  Bella, he made a very fine collection in the Amazons, especially of\r\n  the numerous small species always overlooked by fishermen. On the\r\n  arrival of the Belem I received your kind letter and a part of the\r\n  alcohol I had asked from Mr. Bond. I am writing to-day to ask him to\r\n  send me a part to Teffé, and, somewhat later, more to Manaos. Thank\r\n  you for the catalogue of Pará fishes; I shall give it back on our\r\n  return, with the additions I shall make during the remainder of the\r\n  voyage. Adieu, my dear friend.\r\n\r\n                                            Ever yours,\r\n\r\n                                                             L. AGASSIZ.\r\n\r\nFootnote 64:\r\n\r\n  In the course of the investigation, I have ascertained that this slaty\r\n  rock, as well as the hard sandstone seen along the river-banks at\r\n  Manaos, forms part of the great drift formation of the Amazons, and\r\n  that there is neither old red sandstone, nor trias, here, as older\r\n  observers supposed.—L. A.\r\n\r\nFootnote 65:\r\n\r\n                                              TEFFÉ, 14 September, 1865.\r\n\r\n  SIRE:—On arriving here this morning I had the most agreeable and\r\n  unexpected surprise. The first fish brought to me was the Acara, which\r\n  your Majesty kindly permitted me to dedicate to you, and by an\r\n  unlooked-for good fortune it was the breeding season, and it had its\r\n  mouth full of little young ones in the process of development. Here,\r\n  then, is the most incredible fact in embryology fully confirmed, and\r\n  it remains for me only to study, in detail and at leisure, all the\r\n  changes which the young undergo up to the moment when they leave their\r\n  singular nest, in order that I may publish a complete account of this\r\n  curious history. My anticipations as to the distribution of fishes are\r\n  confirmed; the river is inhabited by several very distinct\r\n  ichthyological faunæ, which have, as a common link, only a very small\r\n  number of species to be met with everywhere. It remains now to\r\n  ascertain with precision the limits of these ichthyological regions,\r\n  and I may perhaps be drawn on to devote some time to this study, if I\r\n  find the means of accomplishing it. There is a question which now\r\n  becomes very interesting; it is to know how far the same phenomenon is\r\n  reproduced in each one of the great affluents of the river Amazons,\r\n  or, in other words, whether the fishes of the upper regions of the Rio\r\n  Madeira, the Rio Negro, &c., &c., are the same as those of the lower\r\n  course of these rivers. As to the diversity of fishes in the whole\r\n  basin, my expectations are far surpassed. Before arriving at Manaos I\r\n  had already collected more than three hundred species, that is to say,\r\n  at least three times the number of species thus far known. About half\r\n  have been painted from life by Mr. Burkhardt; if I can succeed in\r\n  publishing all these documents, the information I shall be able to\r\n  furnish on this subject will exceed all that has been thus far made\r\n  known. I should be very glad to learn that your Majesty has not met\r\n  with difficulties on the voyage, and has been able fully to accomplish\r\n  the ends proposed. We are here without news from the South since we\r\n  left Rio, and all we had learned then was, that after a very stormy\r\n  passage your Majesty had reached the Rio Grande. May God protect and\r\n  bless your Majesty!\r\n\r\n  With sentiments of the most profound respect and the liveliest\r\n  gratitude, I am\r\n\r\n                   Your Majesty’s very humble and obedient servant,\r\n\r\n                                                             L. AGASSIZ.\r\n\r\nFootnote 66:\r\n\r\n  At this point the Amazonian meets the Peruvian steamer, and they\r\n  exchange cargoes. Formerly the Brazilian company of Amazonian steamers\r\n  extended its line of travel to Laguna, at the mouth of the Huallaga.\r\n  Now this part of the journey has passed into the hands of a Peruvian\r\n  company, whose steamers run up to Urimaguas on the Huallaga. They are,\r\n  however, by no means so comfortable as the Brazilian steamers, having\r\n  little or no accommodation for passengers. The upper Marañon is\r\n  navigable for large steamers as far as Jaen, as are also its\r\n  tributaries, the Huallaga and Ucayali on the south, the Moronha,\r\n  Pastazza, and Napo on the north, to a great distance above their\r\n  junction with the main stream. There is reason to believe that all\r\n  these larger affluents of the Amazons will before long have their\r\n  regular lines of steamers like the great river itself. The opening of\r\n  the Amazons, no doubt, will hasten this result.—L. A.\r\n\r\nFootnote 67:\r\n\r\n  These gentlemen descended the river with us as far as Teffé, and we\r\n  afterwards heard of their safe arrival in Madrid. They had, however,\r\n  suffered much in health, and Mr. Isern died soon after his return to\r\n  his native land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII.\r\n                             LIFE IN TEFFÉ.\r\n\r\n  ASPECT OF TEFFÉ.—SITUATION.—DESCRIPTION OF HOUSES.—FISHING\r\n    EXCURSION.—ASTONISHING VARIETY OF FISHES.—ACARA.—SCARCITY OF\r\n    LABORERS.—OUR INDOORS MAN.—BRUNO.—ALEXANDRINA.—PLEASANT\r\n    WALKS.—MANDIOCA-SHED IN THE FOREST.—INDIAN ENCAMPMENT ON THE\r\n    BEACH.—EXCURSION TO FISHING LODGE ON THE SOLIMOENS.—AMAZONIAN\r\n    BEACHES.—BREEDING-PLACES OF TURTLES, FISHES, ETC.—ADROITNESS OF\r\n    INDIANS IN FINDING THEM.—DESCRIPTION OF A “SITIO.”—INDIAN\r\n    CLAY-EATERS.—CUIEIRA-TREE.—FISH HUNT.—FOREST LAKE.—WATER\r\n    BIRDS.—SUCCESS IN COLLECTING.—EVENING SCENE IN SITIO.—ALEXANDRINA\r\n    AS “AIDE SCIENTIFIQUE.”—FISH ANECDOTE.—RELATIONS BETWEEN FISHES AS\r\n    SHOWN BY THEIR EMBRYOLOGY.—NOTE UPON THE MARINE CHARACTER OF THE\r\n    AMAZONIAN FAUNÆ.—ACARA.—NEWS FROM THE PARTIES IN THE\r\n    INTERIOR.—RETURN OF PARTY FROM THE IÇA.—PREPARATIONS FOR\r\n    DEPARTURE.—NOTE ON GENERAL RESULT OF SCIENTIFIC WORK IN\r\n    TEFFÉ.—WAITING FOR THE STEAMER.—SKETCH OF\r\n    ALEXANDRINA.—MOCUIM.—THUNDER-STORM.—REPIQUETE.—GEOLOGICAL\r\n    OBSERVATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_September 27th._—Of all the little settlements we have seen on the\r\nAmazons, Teffé looks the most smiling and pleasant. Just now the town,\r\nor, as it should rather be called, the village, stands, as I have said,\r\nabove a broad sand-beach; in the rainy season, however, we are told that\r\nthe river covers this beach completely, and even encroaches on the\r\nfields beyond, coming almost to the threshold of some of the dwellings.\r\nThe houses are generally built of mud, plastered over and roofed with\r\ntiles, or thatched with palm. Almost all have a little ground about\r\nthem, enclosed in a picket fence, and planted with orange-trees and\r\ndifferent kinds of palms,—Cocoa-nut, Assais, and Pupunhas or\r\npeach-palms. The latter bears, in handsome clusters, a fruit not unlike\r\nthe peach in size and coloring; it has a mealy character when cooked,\r\nand is very palatable, eaten with sugar. The green hill behind the town,\r\non which cows and sheep are grazing,[68] slopes up to the forest, and\r\nmakes a pretty background to the picture. In approaching the village,\r\nmany little inlets of the lake and river give promise of pleasant canoe\r\nexcursions. Through our friend Major Coutinho we had already bespoken\r\nlodgings, and to-day finds us as comfortably established as it is\r\npossible for such wayfarers to be. Our house stands on an open green\r\nfield, running down to the water, and is enclosed only on two sides by\r\nbuildings. In front, it commands a pretty view of the beach and of the\r\nopposite shore across the water. Behind, it has a little open ground\r\nplanted with two or three orange-trees, surrounding a turtle-tank, which\r\nwill be very convenient for keeping live specimens. A well-stocked\r\nturtle-tank is to be found in almost every yard, as the people depend\r\nlargely upon turtles for their food. The interior of the house is very\r\ncommodious. On the right of the flagged entry is a large room already\r\ntransformed into a laboratory. Here are numerous kegs, cans, and barrels\r\nfor specimens, a swinging-shelf to keep birds and insects out of the way\r\nof the ants, a table for drawing, and an immense empty packing-case, one\r\nside of which serves as a table for cleaning and preparing birds, while\r\nthe open space beneath makes a convenient cupboard for keeping the\r\ninstruments and materials of one sort and another, used in the process.\r\nAfter a little practice in travelling one learns to improvise the\r\nconveniences for work almost without the accessories which seem\r\nindispensable at home. Opposite to the laboratory on the other side of\r\nthe entry is a room of the same size, where the gentlemen have slung\r\ntheir hammocks; back of this is my room, from the window of which,\r\nlooking into the court behind, I get a glimpse of some lovely Assai\r\npalms and one or two orange-trees in full flower; adjoining that is the\r\ndining-room, with a large closet leading out of it, used as a\r\nstorage-place for alcohol, and serving at this moment as a prison-house\r\nfor two live alligators who are awaiting execution there. The news of\r\nour arrival has already gone abroad, and the fishermen and boys of the\r\nvillage are bringing in specimens of all sorts,—alligators, turtles,\r\nfish, insects, birds. Enough is already gathered to show what a rich\r\nharvest may be expected in this neighborhood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Veranda and Dining-room at Teffé.]\r\n\r\n_September 28th._—Yesterday afternoon, between sunset and moonlight, our\r\nneighbor Dr. Romualdo invited us to go with him and his friend Senhor\r\nJoaō da Cunha on a fishing excursion into one of the pretty bayous that\r\nopen out to the lake. As our canoe entered it, lazy alligators were\r\nlying about in the still glassy water, with their heads just resting\r\nabove the surface; a tall, gray heron stood on the shore, as if watching\r\nhis reflection, almost as distinct as himself, and a variety of\r\nwater-birds sailed over our heads as we intruded upon their haunts. When\r\nwe had reached a certain point, the Indians sprang up to their necks in\r\nthe water, (which was, by the way, unpleasantly warm,) and stretched the\r\nnet. After a few minutes, they dragged it into shore with a load of\r\nfish, which seemed almost as wonderful as Peter’s miraculous draught. As\r\nthe net was landed the fish broke from it in hundreds, springing through\r\nthe meshes and over the edges, and literally covering the beach. The\r\nIndians are very skilful in drawing the net, going before it and lashing\r\nthe water with long rods to frighten the fish and drive them in. Senhor\r\nda Cunha, who is a very ardent lover of the sport, worked as hard as any\r\nof the boatmen, plunging into the water to lend a hand at the net or\r\ndrive in the fish, and, when the draught was landed on the beach,\r\nrushing about in the mud to catch the little fishes which jumped in\r\nmyriads through the meshes, with an enthusiasm equal to that of Mr.\r\nAgassiz himself. The operation was repeated several times, always with\r\nthe same success, and we returned by moonlight with a boat-load of fish,\r\nwhich Mr. Agassiz is examining this morning, while Mr. Burkhardt makes\r\ncolored drawings of the rarer specimens. Here, as elsewhere in the\r\nAmazonian waters, the variety of species is bewildering. The collections\r\nalready number more than four hundred, including those from Pará, and,\r\nwhile every day brings in new species, new genera are by no means\r\ninfrequent. The following letter to Professor Milne Edwards, of the\r\nJardin des Plantes, gives some account of the work in this department.\r\n\r\n                                           TEFFÉ, le 22 Septembre, 1865.\r\n\r\nMON CHER AMI ET TRÈS HONORÉ CONFRÈRE:—Me voici depuis deux mois dans le\r\nbassin de l’Amazone et c’est ici que j’ai eu la douleur de recevoir la\r\nnouvelle de la mort de mon vieil ami Valenciennes. J’en suis d’autant\r\nplus affecté que personne plus que lui n’aurait apprécié les résultats\r\nde mon voyage, dont je me réjouissais déjà de lui faire part\r\nprochainement. Vous concevrez naturellement que c’est à la classe des\r\npoissons que je consacre la meilleure partie de mon temps et ma récolte\r\nexcède toutes mes prévisions. Vous en jugerez par quelques données. En\r\natteignant Manaos, à la jonction du Rio Negro et de l’Amazonas, j’avais\r\ndéjà recueilli plus de trois cents espèces de poissons, dont la moitié\r\nau moins ont été peintes sur le vivant c. à. d. d’après le poisson\r\nnageant dans un grand vase en verre devant mon dessinateur. Je suis\r\nsouvent peiné de voir avec quelle légèreté on a publié des planches\r\ncoloriées de ces animaux. Ce n’est pas seulement tripler le nombre des\r\nespèces connues, je compte les genres nouveaux par douzaines et j’ai\r\ncinq ou six familles nouvelles pour l’Amazone et une voisine des\r\nGobioides entièrement nouvelle pour l’Ichthyologie. C’est surtout parmi\r\nles petites espèces que je trouve le plus de nouveautés. J’ai des\r\nCharacins de cinq à six centimètres et au-dessous, ornés des teintes les\r\nplus élégantes, des Cyprinodontes, se rapprochant un peu de ceux de Cuba\r\net des Etats-Unis, des Scomberésoces voisins du Bélone de la\r\nMéditerranée, un nombre considérable de Carapoides, des Raies de genres\r\ndifferents de ceux de l’océan, et qui par conséquent ne sont pas des\r\nespèces qui remontent le fleuve. Une foule de Goniodontes et de\r\nChromides de genres et d’espèces inédits. Mais ce que j’apprécie surtout\r\nc’est la facilité que j’ai d’étudier les changements que tous ces\r\npoissons subissent avec l’âge et les différences de sexe qui existent\r\nentr’eux et qui sont souvent très considérables. C’est ainsi que j’ai\r\nobservé une espèce de Geophagus dont le mâle porte sur le front une\r\nbosse très-saillante qui manque entièrement à la femelle et aux jeunes.\r\nCe même poisson a un mode de reproduction des plus extraordinaires. Les\r\nœufs passent, je ne sais trop comment, dans la bouche dont ils tapissent\r\nle fond, entre les appendices intérieurs des arcs branchiaux et surtout\r\ndans une poche formée par les pharyngiens supérieurs qu’ils remplissent\r\ncomplètement. Là ils éclosent et les petits, libérés de leur coque, se\r\ndéveloppent jusqu’à ce qu’ils soient en état de fournir à leur\r\nexistence. Je ne sais pas encore combien de temps cela va durer; mais\r\nj’ai déjà rencontré des exemplaires dont les jeunes n’avaient plus de\r\nsac vitellaire, qui hébergeaient encore leur progéniture. Comme je\r\npasserai environ un mois à Teffé, j’espère pouvoir compléter cette\r\nobservation. L’examen de la structure d’un grand nombre de Chromides m’a\r\nfait entrevoir des affinités entre ces poissons et diverses autres\r\nfamilles dont on ne s’est jamais avisé de les rapprocher. Et d’abord je\r\nme suis convaincu que les Chromides, répartis autrefois parmi les\r\nLabroides et les Sciènoides, constituent bien réellement un groupe\r\nnaturel, reconnu à peu près en même temps et d’une manière indépendante\r\npar Heckel et J. Müller. Mais il y a plus; les genres Enoplosus,\r\nPomotis, Centrarchus et quelques autres genres voisins, rangés parmi les\r\nPercoides par tous les Ichthyologistes, me paraissent, d’ici et sans\r\nmoyen de comparaison directe, tellement voisins des Chromides que je ne\r\nvois pas comment on pourra les en séparer, surtout maintenant que je\r\nsais que les pharyngiens inférieurs ne sont pas toujours soudés chez les\r\nChromides. Et puis l’embryologie et les métamorphoses des Chromides que\r\nje viens d’étudier m’ont convaincu que les “Poissons à branchies\r\nlabyrinthiques” séparés de tous les autres poissons par Cuvier comme une\r\nfamille entièrement isolée, à raison de la structure étrange de ses\r\norganes respiratoires, se rattachent de très-près aux Chromides. Ce\r\ngroupe devient ainsi par ses affinités variées, l’un des plus\r\nintéressants de la classe des poissons, et le bassin de l’Amazone paraît\r\nêtre la vraie patrie de cette famille. Je ne veux pas vous fatiguer de\r\nmes recherches ichthyologiques; permettez moi seulement d’ajouter que\r\nles poissons ne sont point uniformément répandus dans ce grand bassin.\r\nDéjà j’ai acquis la certitude qu’il faut y distinguer plusieurs faunes\r\nichthyologiques, très-nettement caractérisées; c’est ainsi que les\r\nespèces qui habitent la rivière du Pará, des bords de la mer jusque vers\r\nl’embouchure du Tocantins, diffèrent de celles que l’on rencontre dans\r\nle réseau d’anastomoses qui unissent la rivière de Pará à l’Amazone\r\npropre. Les espèces de l’Amazone, au-dessous du Xingu, diffèrent de\r\ncelles que j’ai rencontrées plus haut; celles du cours inférieur du\r\nXingu, diffèrent de celles du cours inférieur du Tapajos. Celles des\r\nnombreux igarapés et lacs de Manaos diffèrent également de celles du\r\ncours principal du grand fleuve et de ses principaux affluents. Il reste\r\nmaintenant à étudier les changements qui peuvent survenir dans cette\r\ndistribution, dans le cours de l’année, suivant la hauteur des eaux et\r\npeut-être aussi suivant l’époque à laquelle les différentes espèces\r\npondent leurs œufs. Jusqu’à présent je n’ai rencontré qu’un petit nombre\r\nd’espèces qui aient une aire de distribution très étendue. C’est ainsi\r\nque le Sudis gigas se trouve à-peu-près partout. C’est le poisson le\r\nplus important du fleuve; celui qui comme aliment remplace le bétail\r\npour les populations riveraines. Un autre problème à résoudre c’est de\r\nsavoir jusqu’à quel point les grands affluents de l’Amazone répètent ce\r\nphénomène de la distribution locale des poissons. Je vais chercher à le\r\nrésoudre en remontant le Rio Negro et le Rio Madeira et comme je\r\nreviendrai à Manaos, je pourrai comparer mes premières observations dans\r\ncette localité, avec celles d’une autre saison de l’année. Adieu, mon\r\ncher ami. Veuillez faire mes amitiés à M. Elie de Beaumont et me\r\nrappeler aux bons souvenirs de ceux de mes collègues de l’Académie qui\r\nveulent bien s’intéresser à mes travaux actuels. Faites aussi, je vous\r\nprie, mes amitiés à M. votre fils.\r\n\r\n                              Tout à vous,\r\n\r\n                                                         L. AGASSIZ.[69]\r\n\r\nMr. Agassiz has already secured quite a number of the singular type of\r\nAcarà, which carries its young in its mouth, and he has gathered a good\r\ndeal of information about its habits. The fishermen here say that this\r\nmode of caring for the young prevails more or less in all the family of\r\nAcarà. They are not all born there, however; some lay their eggs in the\r\nsand, and, hovering over their nest, take up the little ones in their\r\nmouth, when they are hatched. The fishermen also add, that these fish do\r\nnot always keep their young in the mouth, but leave them sometimes in\r\nthe nest, taking them up only on the approach of danger.[70]\r\n\r\nOur household is now established on a permanent basis. We had at first\r\nsome difficulty in finding servants; at this fishing season, when the\r\nmen are going off to dry and salt fish, and when the season for hunting\r\nturtle-eggs and making turtle-butter is coming on, the town is almost\r\ndeserted by the men. It is like haying-time in this country, when every\r\narm is needed in the fields. Then the habits of the Indians are so\r\nirregular, and they care so little for money, finding, as they do, the\r\nmeans of living almost without work immediately about them, that even if\r\none does engage a servant, he is likely to disappear the next day. An\r\nIndian will do more for good-will and a glass of cachaça (rum) than he\r\nwill do for wages, which are valueless to him. The individual, who has\r\nbeen supplying the place of indoors man while we have been looking for a\r\nservant, is so original in his appearance that he deserves a special\r\ndescription. He belongs to a neighbor who has undertaken to provide our\r\nmeals, and he brings them when they are prepared and waits on the table.\r\nHe is rather an elderly Indian, and his dress consists of a pair of\r\ncotton drawers, originally white, but now of many hues and usually\r\nrolled up to the knees, his feet being bare; the upper part of his\r\nperson is partially (very partially) concealed by a blue rag, which I\r\nsuppose in some early period of the world’s history must have been a\r\nshirt; this extraordinary figure is surmounted by an old straw hat full\r\nof holes, bent in every direction, and tied under the chin by a red\r\nstring. Had he not been a temporary substitute, we should have tried to\r\nobtain a more respectable livery for him; but to-day he gives place to\r\nan Indian lad, Bruno by name, who presents a more decent appearance,\r\nthough he seems rather bewildered by his new office. At present his idea\r\nof waiting on the table seems to be to sit on the floor and look at us\r\nwhile we eat. However, we hope to break him in gradually. He looks as if\r\nhe had not been long redeemed from the woods, for his face is deeply\r\ntattooed with black, and his lips and nose are pierced with holes,\r\nreminding one of the becoming vanities he has renounced in favor of\r\ncivilization.[71] Besides Bruno we have a girl, Alexandrina by name,\r\nwho, by her appearance, has a mixture of Indian and black blood in her\r\nveins. She promises very well, and seems to have the intelligence of the\r\nIndian with the greater pliability of the negro.\r\n\r\n_September 29th._—One of the great charms of our residence here is, that\r\nwe have so many pleasant walks within easy reach. My favorite walk in\r\nthe early morning is to the wood on the brow of the hill. From the\r\nsummit, the sunrise is lovely over the village below, the lake with its\r\nmany picturesque points and inlets, and the forests on the opposite\r\nshores. From this spot a little path through the bushes brings one at\r\nonce into a thick, beautiful wood. Here one may wander at will, for\r\nthere are a great many paths, worn by the Indians, through the trees;\r\nand one is constantly tempted on by the cool, pleasant shade, and by the\r\nperfume of moss and fern and flower. The forest here is full of life and\r\nsound. The buzz of insects, the shrill cry of the cicadas, the\r\nchattering talk of the papagaios, and occasionally busy voices of the\r\nmonkeys, make the woods eloquent. The monkeys are, however, very\r\ndifficult of approach, and though I hear them often, I have not yet seen\r\nthem on the trees; but Mr. Hunnewell told me that the other day, when\r\nshooting in this very wood, he came upon a family of small white monkeys\r\nsitting on a bough together, and talking with much animation. One of the\r\nprettiest of the paths, with which my daily walks made me familiar,\r\nleads over an igarapé to a house, or rather to a large thatched shed, in\r\nthe forest, used for preparing mandioca. It is supplied with four large\r\nclay ovens, having immense shallow pans fitted on to the top, with\r\ntroughs for kneading, sieves for straining, and all the apparatus for\r\nthe various processes to which the mandioca is subjected. One utensil is\r\nvery characteristic; the large, empty turtle-shells, which may be seen\r\nin every kitchen, used as basins, bowls, &c. I suppose this little\r\nestablishment is used by a number of persons, for in my morning walks I\r\nalways meet troops of Indians going to it, the women with their deep\r\nworking baskets,—something like the Swiss “hotte,”—in which they carry\r\ntheir tools, on their backs, supported by a straw band fastened across\r\nthe forehead, and their babies astride on their hips, so as to leave\r\ntheir hands perfectly free. They always give me a cordial morning\r\ngreeting and stop to look at the plants and flowers with which I am\r\nusually laden. Some of the women are quite pretty, but as a general\r\nthing the Indians in this part of the country do not look very healthy,\r\nand are apt to have diseases of the eyes and skin. It is a curious thing\r\nthat the natives seem more liable to the maladies of the country than\r\nstrangers. They are very subject to intermittent fevers, and one often\r\nsees Indians worn to mere skin and bone by this terrible scourge.\r\n\r\nIf the morning walk in the woods is delightful, the evening stroll on\r\nthe beach in front of the house is no less so, when the water is dyed in\r\nthe purple sunset, and the quiet of the scene is broken here and there\r\nby a fire on the sands, around which a cluster of Indians are cooking\r\ntheir supper. As Major Coutinho and I were walking on the shore last\r\nevening we came on such a group. They were a family who had come over\r\nfrom their home on the other side of the lake, with a boat-load of fish\r\nand turtle to sell in the village. When they have disposed of their\r\ncargo, they build their fire on the beach, eat their supper of salted or\r\nbroiled fish, farinha, and the nuts of a particular kind of palm\r\n(Atalea), and then sleep in their canoe. We sat down with them, and,\r\nthat they should not think we came merely out of curiosity, we shared\r\ntheir nuts and farinha, and they were soon very sociable. I am\r\nconstantly astonished at the frank geniality of these people, so\r\ndifferent from our sombre, sullen Indians, who are so unwilling to talk\r\nwith strangers. The cordiality of their reception, however, depends very\r\nmuch on the way in which they are accosted. Major Coutinho, who has\r\npassed years among them, understands their character well, and has\r\nremarkable tact in his dealings with them. He speaks their language a\r\nlittle also, and this is important here where many of the Indians speak\r\nonly the “lingua geral.” This was the case with several of the family\r\nwhose acquaintance we made last evening, though some of them talked in\r\nPortuguese fluently enough, telling us about their life in the forest,\r\ntheir success in disposing of their fish and turtle, and inviting us to\r\ncome to their house. They pointed out to us one of the younger girls,\r\nwho they said had never been baptized, and they seemed to wish to have\r\nthe rite performed. Major Coutinho promised to speak to the priest about\r\nit for them. So far as we can learn, the white population do little to\r\ncivilize the Indians beyond giving them the external rites of religion.\r\nIt is the old sad story of oppression, duplicity, and license on the\r\npart of the white man, which seems likely to last as long as skins shall\r\ndiffer, and which necessarily ends in the degradation of both races.\r\n\r\n_October 4th._—On Saturday morning at four o’clock, Major Coutinho, Mr.\r\nAgassiz, and myself left Teffé in company with our neighbor and landlord\r\nMajor Estolano, on our way to his “sitio,” a rough sort of Indian lodge\r\non the other side of the Solimoens, where he goes occasionally with his\r\nfamily to superintend the drying and salting of fish, a great article of\r\ncommerce here. It had rained heavily all night, but the stars were\r\nbright, and the morning was cool and fresh when we put off in the canoe.\r\nWhen we issued from Teffé lake it was already broad day, and by the time\r\nwe entered the Solimoens we began to have admonitions that\r\nbreakfast-time was approaching. There is something very pleasant in\r\nthese improvised meals; the coffee tastes better when you have made it\r\nyourself, setting up the coffee-machine under the straw-roof of the\r\ncanoe, dipping up the water from the river over the side of the boat,\r\nand cooking your own breakfast. One would think it a great bore at home,\r\nwith all the necessary means and appliances; but with the stimulus of\r\ndifficulty and the excitement of the journey it is quite pleasant, and\r\ngives a new relish to ordinary fare. After we had had a cup of hot\r\ncoffee and a farinha biscuit, being somewhat cramped with sitting in the\r\ncanoe, we landed for a walk on a broad beach along which we were\r\ncoasting. There is much to be learned on these Amazonian beaches; they\r\nare the haunts and breeding-places of many different kinds of animals,\r\nand are covered by tracks of alligators, turtles, and capivari. Then\r\nthere are the nests, not only of alligators and turtles, but of the\r\ndifferent kind of fishes and birds that lay their eggs in the mud or\r\nsand. It is curious to see the address of the Indians in finding the\r\nturtle-nests; they walk quickly over the sand, but with a sort of\r\ninquiring tread, as if they carried an instinctive perception in their\r\nstep, and the moment they set their foot upon a spot below which eggs\r\nare deposited, though there is no external evidence to the eye, they\r\nrecognize it at once, and, stooping, dig straight down to the eggs,\r\ngenerally eight or ten inches under the surface. Besides these tracks\r\nand nests, there are the rounded, shallow depressions in the mud, which\r\nthe fishermen say are the sleeping-places of the skates. They have\r\ncertainly about the form and size of the skate, and one can easily\r\nbelieve that these singular impressions in the soft surface have been\r\nmade in this way. The vegetation on these beaches is not less\r\ninteresting than these signs of animal life. In the rainy season more\r\nthan half a mile of land, now uncovered along the margins of the river,\r\nis entirely under water, the river rising not only to the edge of the\r\nforest, but penetrating far into it. At this time of the year, however,\r\nthe shore consists, first of the beach, then of a broad band of tall\r\ngrasses, beyond which are the lower shrubs and trees, leading up, by a\r\nsort of gradation, to the full forest growth. During this dry season the\r\nvegetation makes an effort to recover its lost ground; one sees the\r\nlittle Imbauba (Cecropia) and a kind of willow-tree (Salix humboldiana),\r\nthe only familiar plant we met, springing up on the sand, and creeping\r\ndown to the water’s edge, only to be destroyed again with the next rise\r\nof the river. While we were walking, the boatmen were dragging the net,\r\nand though not with such astonishing success as the other day, yet it\r\nlanded not only an ample supply of fresh fish for breakfast, but also a\r\nnumber of interesting specimens. At about eleven o’clock we turned from\r\nthe Solimoens into the little river on which Mr. Estolano’s\r\nfishing-lodge is situated, and in a few minutes found ourselves at the\r\npretty landing, where a rough flight of steps led up to the house. In\r\nthis climate a very slight shelter will serve as a house. Such a\r\ndwelling is indeed nothing but a vast porch; and a very airy, pleasant,\r\nand picturesque abode it makes. A palm-thatched roof to shed the rain\r\nand keep off the sun, covering a platform of split logs that one may\r\nhave a dry floor under foot; these, with plenty of posts and rafters for\r\nthe swinging of hammocks, are the essentials. It was somewhat after this\r\nfashion that Major Estolano’s lodge was built. The back part of it\r\nconsisted of one very large, high chamber, to which the family retired\r\nin the hottest part of the day, when the sun was most scorching; all the\r\nrest was roof and platform, the latter stretching out considerably\r\nbeyond the former, thus leaving an open floor on one side for the\r\nstretching and drying of fish. The whole structure was lifted on piles\r\nabout eight feet above the ground, to provide against the rising of the\r\nriver in the rainy season. In front of the house, just on the edge of\r\nthe bank, were several large, open, thatched sheds, used as kitchen and\r\nliving-rooms for the negroes and Indians employed in the preparation of\r\nthe fish. In one of these rooms were several Indian women who looked\r\nvery ill. We were told they had been there for two months, and they were\r\nworn to skin and bone with intermittent fever. Major Coutinho said they\r\nwere, no doubt, suffering in part from the habit so prevalent among\r\nthese people of eating clay and dirt, for which they have a morbid love.\r\nThey were wild-looking creatures, lying in their hammocks or squatting\r\non the ground, often without any clothes, and moaning as if in pain.\r\nThey were from the forest, and spoke no Portuguese.\r\n\r\nWe were received most cordially by the ladies of the family, who had\r\ngone up to the lodge the day before, and were offered the refreshment of\r\na hammock, the first act of hospitality in this country, when one\r\narrives from any distance. After this followed an excellent breakfast of\r\nthe fresh fish we had brought with us, cooked in a variety of ways,\r\nbroiled, fried, and boiled. The repast was none the less appetizing that\r\nit was served in picnic fashion, the cloth being laid on the floor, upon\r\none of the large palm-mats, much in use here to spread over the\r\nuncarpeted brick floors or under the hammocks. For several hours after\r\nbreakfast the heat was intense, and we could do little but rest in the\r\nshade, though Mr. Agassiz, who works at all hours if specimens are on\r\nhand, was busy in making skeletons of some fish too large to be\r\npreserved in alcohol. Towards evening it grew cooler, and we walked in\r\nthe banana plantation near the house, and sat under an immense\r\ngourd-tree on the bank, which made a deep shade; for it was clothed not\r\nonly by its own foliage, but the branches were covered with parasites,\r\nand with soft, dark moss, in contrast with which the lighter green,\r\nglossy fruit seemed to gain new lustre. I call it a gourd-tree, simply\r\nfrom the use to which the fruit is put. But it goes here by the name of\r\nthe Cuieira-tree (Crescentia Cajeput), the cup made from the fruit being\r\ncalled a Cuia. The fruit is spherical, of a light green, shiny surface,\r\nand grows from the size of an apple to that of the largest melon. It is\r\nfilled with a soft, white pulp, easily removed when the fruit is cut in\r\nhalves; the rind is then allowed to dry. Very pretty cups and basins, of\r\nmany sizes, are made in this way; and the Indians, who understand how to\r\nprepare a variety of very brilliant colors, are very skilful in painting\r\nthem. It would seem that the art of making colors is of ancient date\r\namong the Amazonian Indians, for in the account of Francisco Orellana’s\r\njourney down the Amazons in 1541, “the two fathers of the expedition\r\ndeclare that in this voyage they found all the people to be both\r\nintelligent and ingenious, which was shown by the works which they\r\nperformed in sculpture and painting in bright colors.”[72] Their paints\r\nare prepared from a particular kind of clay and from the juices of\r\nseveral plants which have coloring properties. In an Amazonian cottage\r\none hardly sees any utensils for the table except such as the Indians\r\nhave prepared and ornamented themselves from the fruits of the\r\nCuieira-tree. I longed to extend my walk into the woods which surrounded\r\nus on all sides; but the forest is very tantalizing here, so tempting\r\nand so impenetrable. The ladies told me there were no paths cut in the\r\nneighborhood of the house.\r\n\r\nThe next morning we were off early in the canoes on a fish hunt; I call\r\nit a hunt advisedly, for the fish are the captives of the bow and spear,\r\nnot of the net and line. The Indians are very adroit in shooting the\r\nlarger fish with the bow and arrow, and in harpooning some of the\r\nveritable monsters of their rivers, such as the Peixe-boi (“fish-cow”),\r\nManatee or Dugon, with the spear. We made two parties this morning, some\r\nof us going in the larger canoe to drag a forest lake with the net,\r\nwhile some of the fishermen took a smaller, lighter boat, to be able to\r\napproach their larger prey. Our path lay through a pretty igarapé,\r\nwhere, for the first time, I saw monkeys in a tree by the water-side. On\r\ncoming to the Amazons we expect to see monkeys as frequently as\r\nsquirrels are seen at home; but, though very numerous, they are so shy\r\nthat one rarely gets a fair view of them. After an hour’s row we landed\r\nat a little point jutting out into the water, and went through the\r\nforest, the men cutting the way before us, clearing the path of\r\nbranches, fallen trees, and parasitic vines which obstructed it. I was\r\nastonished to see the vigor and strength with which Dona Maria, the\r\nmother-in-law of our host, made her way through the tangled trees,\r\nhelping to free the road, and lopping off branches with her great\r\nwood-knife. We imagine all the ladies in this warm country to be very\r\nindolent and languid; and in the cities, as a general thing, their\r\nhabits are much less vigorous than those of our women. But here, in the\r\nUpper Amazons, the women who have been brought up in the country and in\r\nthe midst of the Indians are often very energetic, bearing a hand at the\r\noar or the fishing-net with the strength of a man. A short walk brought\r\nus out upon a shallow forest lake, or, as the Indians call it, “round\r\nwater.” The Indian names are often very significant. I have mentioned\r\nthe meaning of igarapé, “boat path”; to this, when they wish to indicate\r\nits size more exactly, they affix either the word “assù” (large) or\r\n“mirim” (small). But an igarapé, whether large or small, is always a\r\nchannel opening out of the main river and having no other outlet. For a\r\nchannel connecting the upper and lower waters of the same river, or\r\nleading from one river to another, they have another word, “Paraná”\r\n(signifying river), which they modify in the same way, as Paraná-assú or\r\nParaná-mirim. Paraná-assú, the big river, means also the sea. A still\r\nmore significant name for a channel connecting two rivers is the\r\nPortuguese word “fúro,” meaning bore.\r\n\r\nThe lake was set in the midst of long, reed-like grass, and, as we\r\napproached it, thousands of white water-birds rustled up from the margin\r\nand floated like a cloud above us. The reason of their numbers was plain\r\nwhen we reached the lake: it was actually lined with shrimps; one could\r\ndip them out by the bucketful. The boatmen now began to drag the net,\r\nand perhaps nowhere, from any single lake or pond, has Mr. Agassiz made\r\na more valuable collection of forest fishes. Among them was a pipe-fish,\r\none of the Goniodont family, very similar to our ordinary Syngnathus in\r\nappearance, but closely related to Acestra, and especially interesting\r\nto him as throwing light on certain investigations of his, made when\r\nquite a young man. This specimen confirmed a classification by which he\r\nthen associated the pipe-fish with the Garpikes and Sturgeons, a\r\ncombination which was scouted by the best naturalists of the time, and\r\nis even now repudiated by most of them. Without self-glorification, it\r\nis impossible not to be gratified when the experience of later years\r\nconfirms the premonitions of youth, and shows them to have been not mere\r\nguesses, but founded upon an insight into the true relations of things.\r\nWearied after a while with watching the fishing in the sun, I went back\r\ninto the forest, where I found the coffee-pot already boiling over the\r\nfire. It was pleasant to sit down on a fallen, moss-grown trunk, and\r\nbreakfast in the shade. Presently the fishermen came back from the lake,\r\nand we found our way to the boats again, laden with an immense number of\r\nfishes. The gentlemen returned to the house in one of the smaller\r\nmontarias, taking the specimens with them, and leaving me to return in\r\nthe larger canoe with the Senhoras. It seemed to me strange on this\r\nSunday morning, when the bells must be ringing and the people trooping\r\nto church under the bright October sky, in our far-off New England home,\r\nto be floating down this quiet igarapé, in a boat full of half-naked\r\nIndians, their wild, monotonous chant sounding in our ears as they kept\r\ntime to their oars. In these excursions one learns to understand the\r\nfascination this life must have for a people among whom civilization is\r\nas yet but very incomplete; it is full of physical enjoyment, without\r\nany mental effort. Up early in the morning and off on their fishing or\r\nhunting excursions long before dawn, they return by the middle of the\r\nday, lie in their hammocks and smoke during the hours of greatest heat;\r\ncook the fish they have brought with them, and, unless sickness comes to\r\nthem, know neither want nor care. We reached the house in time for a\r\ntwelve o’clock breakfast of a more solid character than the lighter one\r\nin the forest, and by no means unacceptable after our long row. In the\r\ncourse of the day two “Peixe-bois” (Manatees) were brought in, also a\r\nBoto (porpoise), and some large specimens of Pirarucu (Sudis). All these\r\nare too clumsy to preserve in alcohol, especially when alcohol is so\r\ndifficult to obtain and so expensive as it is here; but Mr. Agassiz has\r\nhad skeletons made of them, and will preserve the skins of the\r\nPeixe-bois for mounting. He obtained at the same time an entirely new\r\ngenus of the Siluroid family. It is a fish weighing some ten pounds,\r\ncalled here the Pacamum, and of a bright canary color.\r\n\r\nThe evening scene at the “Sitio” was always very pretty. After dinner,\r\nwhen the customary “boa noite,” the universal greeting at the close of\r\nthe day, had been exchanged, the palm-mats, spread over the platforms,\r\nhad each their separate group, Indians or negroes, children, members of\r\nthe family or guests, the central figure being usually that of Major\r\nCoutinho, who was considered to be especially successful in the making\r\nof coffee and who generally had a mat to himself, where he looked, as\r\nthe blue flame of his alcohol lamp flickered in the wind, not unlike a\r\nmagician of old, brewing some potent spell. Little shallow cups, like\r\nopen antique lamps, filled with oil and having a bit of wick hanging\r\nover the edge, were placed about the floors, and served to light the\r\ninterior of the porch, though after a glimmering and uncertain fashion.\r\nOn Monday morning we left the “Sitio” and returned to Teffé, where Mr.\r\nAgassiz had the pleasure of receiving all his collections, both those he\r\nhad sent on before him and those which accompanied us, in good\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\n_October 9th._—Alexandrina turns out to be a valuable addition to the\r\nhousehold, not only from a domestic, but also from a scientific point of\r\nview. She has learned to prepare and clean skeletons of fish very\r\nnicely, and makes herself quite useful in the laboratory. Besides, she\r\nknows many paths in the forest, and accompanies me in all my botanizing\r\nexcursions; with the keen perceptions of a person whose only training\r\nhas been through the senses, she is far quicker than I am in discerning\r\nthe smallest plant in fruit or flower, and now that she knows what I am\r\nseeking, she is a very efficient aid. Nimble as a monkey, she thinks\r\nnothing of climbing to the top of a tree to bring down a blossoming\r\nbranch; and here, where many of the trees shoot up to quite a height\r\nbefore putting out their boughs, such an auxiliary is very important.\r\nThe collections go on apace, and every day brings in new species; more\r\nthan can be easily cared for,—far more than our artist can find time to\r\ndraw. Yesterday, among other specimens, a hollow log was brought in,\r\nsome two feet and a half in length, and about three inches in diameter,\r\ncrowded with Anojas (a common fish here) of all sizes, from those\r\nseveral inches long to the tiniest young. The thing was so extraordinary\r\nthat one would have been inclined to think it was prepared in order to\r\nbe passed off as a curiosity, had not the fish been so dexterously\r\npacked into the log from end to end, that it was impossible to get them\r\nout without splitting it open, when they were all found alive and in\r\nperfectly good condition. They could not have been artificially jammed\r\ninto the hollow wood, in that way, without injuring them. The fishermen\r\nsay that this is the habit of the family; they are often found thus\r\ncrowded into dead logs at the bottom of the river, making their nests as\r\nit were in the cavities of the wood.[73]\r\n\r\n_October 14th._—Mr. Agassiz has a corps of little boys engaged in\r\ncatching the tiniest fishes, so insignificant in size that the regular\r\nfishermen, who can never be made to understand that a fish which is not\r\ngood to eat can serve any useful purpose, always throw them away.\r\nNevertheless, these are among the most instructive specimens for the\r\nichthyologist, because they often reveal the relations not only between\r\nparent and offspring, but wider relations between different groups. Mr.\r\nAgassiz’s investigations on these little fish here have shown repeatedly\r\nthat the young of some species resemble closely the adult of others.\r\nSuch a fish, not more than half an inch long, was brought to him\r\nyesterday. It constitutes a new genus, Lymnobelus, and belongs to the\r\nbill-fish family, Scomberesoces, with Belone and others,—that long,\r\nnarrow type, with a long beak, which has such a wide distribution over\r\nthe world. In the Northern United States, as well as in the\r\nMediterranean, it has a representative of the genus Scomberesox, in\r\nwhich the jaws of its long snout are gaping; in the Mediterranean, and\r\nalmost everywhere in the temperate and torrid zones, Belones are found\r\nin which, on the contrary, the bill is closed; in Florida and on the\r\nBrazilian coast, as well as in the Pacific, species of Hemirhamphus\r\noccur in which the two jaws are unequal, the upper one being very short\r\nand the lower one enormously long, while the Amazonian bill-fish has a\r\nsomewhat different cut of the bill from either of those mentioned above,\r\nthough both jaws are very long, as in Belone. When, then, the young of\r\nthis Amazonian species was brought to Mr. Agassiz, he naturally expected\r\nto find it like its parent. On the contrary, he found it far more like\r\nthe species of Florida and the Brazilian coast, having the two jaws\r\nunequal, the upper one excessively short, the lower enormously long,\r\nshowing that the Amazonian species, before taking on its own\r\ncharacteristic features, passes through a stage resembling the permanent\r\nadult condition of the Hemirhamphus. It is interesting to find that\r\nanimals, which have their natural homes so far from each other that\r\nthere is no possibility of any material connection between them, are yet\r\nso linked together by structural laws, that the development of one\r\nspecies should recall the adult form of another.[74] The story of the\r\nAcaras, the fish which carries its young in its mouth, grows daily more\r\nwonderful. This morning Mr. Agassiz was off before dawn, on a fishing\r\nexcursion with Major Estolano, and returned with numerous specimens of a\r\nnew species of that family. These specimens furnished a complete\r\nembryological series, some of them having their eggs at the back of the\r\ngills, between the upper pharyngeals and the branchial arches, others\r\ntheir young in the mouth in different stages of development, up to those\r\na quarter of an inch long and able to swim about, full of life and\r\nactivity, when removed from the gills and placed in water. The most\r\nadvanced were always found outside of the gills, within the cavity\r\nformed by the gill-covers and the wide branchiostegal membrane. In\r\nexamining these fishes Mr. Agassiz has found that a special lobe of the\r\nbrain, similar to those of the Triglas, sends large nerves to that part\r\nof the gills which protects the young; thus connecting the care of the\r\noffspring with the organ of intelligence. The specimens of this morning\r\nseem to invalidate the statement of the fishermen, that the young,\r\nthough often found in the mouth of the parent, are not actually\r\ndeveloped there, but laid and hatched in the sand. The series, in these\r\nspecimens, was too complete to leave any doubt that in this species at\r\nleast the whole process of development is begun and completed in the\r\ngill-cavity.\r\n\r\n_October 17th._—Teffé. Yesterday, to our great pleasure, our companions,\r\nMr. James and Mr. Talisman, returned from their canoe expedition on the\r\nrivers Iça and Hyutahy, bringing most valuable collections. Mr. Agassiz\r\nhas felt some anxiety about their success, as, in consequence of their\r\nsmall supply of alcohol, for preserving specimens, which was,\r\nnevertheless, all he could spare from the common store, a great deal of\r\njudgment in the choice of specimens was required in order to make a\r\ntruly characteristic collection. The commission could not have been\r\nbetter executed, and the result raises the number of species from the\r\nAmazonian waters to more than six hundred, every day showing more\r\nclearly how distinctly the species are localized, and that this immense\r\nbasin is divided into numerous zoölogical areas, each one of which has\r\nits own combination of fishes. Our stay at Teffé draws to a close, and\r\nto-day begins the great work of packing, in preparation for the arrival\r\nof the steamer at the end of the week. These days are the most laborious\r\nof all; on leaving every station, all the alcoholic specimens have to be\r\noverhauled, their condition ascertained, the barrels, kegs, and cans\r\nexamined, to make sure that the hoops are fast, and that there are no\r\nleakages. Fortunately, there are some of our party who are very\r\ndexterous as coopers and joiners, and at these times the laboratory is\r\nturned into a workshop. We were reminded of the labors of the day by a\r\ncircular distributed at breakfast this morning:—\r\n\r\n  “SIR:—The ‘United Coopers’ Association’ will meet in the laboratory\r\n  after breakfast. You are particularly requested to attend.\r\n\r\n  “TEFFÉ, Oct. 17th, 1865.”\r\n\r\nAnd at this moment the laboratory rings with click of hammer, and nails,\r\nand iron hoops. As usual, there are a number of uninvited spectators\r\nwatching the breaking up of the scientific establishment, which has\r\nbeen, during the past month, a source of constant entertainment to the\r\nvagrant population of Teffé. In this country of open doors and windows\r\none has not the same protection against intrusion as in a colder\r\nclimate, and we have had a constant succession of curious visitors\r\nhanging about our premises.\r\n\r\nI have dwelt especially on the fish collection; but we do not go away\r\nempty-handed in other respects. Mr. Dexter has prepared a large number\r\nof the forest birds for mounting,—papagaios, toucans, and a great\r\nvariety of smaller species of very brilliant plumage, not to speak of\r\nthe less showy water-birds. He has been often in the woods shooting,\r\nwith Mr. Hunnewell and Mr. Thayer, and has employed several sportsmen of\r\nthe place to assist him. Turtles, jacarés, and snakes are also largely\r\nrepresented in the collections; and Mr. Agassiz has obtained, by\r\npurchase, a large and well-preserved collection of insects, made by a\r\nFrenchman during a several years’ residence in this little town. In\r\nTeffé and its neighborhood we constantly tread in the footsteps of the\r\nEnglish naturalist, Mr. Bates, “Senhor Henrique,” as the people call him\r\nhere, whose charming book, “The Naturalist on the Amazons,” has been a\r\nvery pleasant companion to us in our wanderings.[75]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Head of Alexandrina.]\r\n\r\n_October 21st._—Since Thursday afternoon our canoe has been loaded, all\r\nthe specimens, amounting to something more than thirty barrels, kegs,\r\nand boxes, packed and waiting the arrival of the steamer. We have paid\r\nour parting visits to friends and acquaintances here. I have taken my\r\nlast ramble in the woods where I have had so many pleasant walks, and\r\nnow we are sitting in the midst of valises and carpet-bags, waiting to\r\nsee the steamer round the wooded point in front of the house, before we\r\nturn the key on our four weeks’ home, and close this chapter of our\r\nAmazonian life. In this country, where time seems to be of comparatively\r\nlittle importance, one is never sure whether the boat will leave or\r\narrive on the appointed day. One has only to make the necessary\r\npreparations, and then practise the favorite Brazilian virtue,\r\n“paciencia.” The adjoining sketch is a portrait of my little house-maid,\r\nAlexandrina, who, from her mixture of Negro and Indian blood, is rather\r\na curious illustration of the amalgamation of races here. She consented\r\nyesterday, after a good deal of coy demur, to have her portrait taken.\r\nMr. Agassiz wanted it especially on account of her extraordinary hair,\r\nwhich, though it has lost its compact negro crinkle, and acquired\r\nsomething of the length and texture of the Indian hair, retains,\r\nnevertheless, a sort of wiry elasticity, so that, when combed out, it\r\nstands off from her head in all directions as if electrified. In the\r\nexamples of negro and Indian half-breeds we have seen, the negro type\r\nseems the first to yield, as if the more facile disposition of the\r\nnegro, as compared with the enduring tenacity of the Indian, showed\r\nitself in their physical as well as their mental characteristics. A few\r\nremarks, gathered from Mr. Agassiz’s notes on the general character of\r\nthe population in this region may not be without interest.\r\n\r\n“Two things are strongly impressed on the mind of the traveller in the\r\nUpper Amazons. The necessity, in the first place, of a larger\r\npopulation, and, secondly, of a better class of whites, before any fair\r\nbeginning can be made in developing the resources of the country; and,\r\nas an inducement to this, the importance of taking off all restraint on\r\nthe navigation of the Amazons and its tributaries, opening them to the\r\nambition and competition of other nations. Not only is the white\r\npopulation too small for the task before it, but it is no less poor in\r\nquality than meagre in numbers. It presents the singular spectacle of a\r\nhigher race receiving the impress of a lower one, of an educated class\r\nadopting the habits and sinking to the level of the savage. In the towns\r\nof the Solimoens the people who pass for the white gentry of the land,\r\nwhile they profit by the ignorance of the Indian to cheat and abuse him,\r\nnevertheless adopt his social habits, sit on the ground and eat with\r\ntheir fingers as he does. Although it is forbidden by law to enslave the\r\nIndian, there is a practical slavery by which he becomes as absolutely\r\nin the power of the master as if he could be bought and sold. The white\r\nman engages an Indian to work for him at a certain rate, at the same\r\ntime promising to provide him with clothes and food until such time as\r\nhe shall have earned enough to take care of himself. This outfit, in\r\nfact, costs the employer little; but when the Indian comes to receive\r\nhis wages he is told that he is already in debt to his master for what\r\nhas been advanced to him; instead of having a right to demand money, he\r\nowes work. The Indians, even those who live about the towns, are\r\nsingularly ignorant of the true value of things. They allow themselves\r\nto be deceived in this way to an extraordinary extent, and remain bound\r\nto the service of a man for a lifetime, believing themselves under the\r\nburden of a debt, while they are, in fact, creditors. Besides this\r\nvirtual slavery, an actual traffic of the Indians does go on: but it is\r\nso far removed from the power of the authorities that they cannot, if\r\nthey would, put a stop to it. A better class of emigrants would suppress\r\nmany of these evils. Americans or Englishmen might be sordid in their\r\ntransactions with the natives; their hands are certainly not clean in\r\ntheir dealings with the dark-skinned races; but they would not degrade\r\nthemselves to the social level of the Indians as the Portuguese do; they\r\nwould not adopt his habits.”\r\n\r\nI cannot say good by to Teffé without a word in commemoration of one\r\nclass of its inhabitants who have interfered very seriously with our\r\ncomfort. There is a tiny creature called the Mocuim, scarcely visible\r\nexcept for its bright vermilion color, which swarms all over the grass\r\nand low growth here. It penetrates under the skin so that one would\r\nsuppose a red rash had broken out over the body, and causes excessive\r\nitching, ending sometimes in troublesome sores. On returning from a walk\r\nit is necessary to bathe in alcohol and water, in order to allay the\r\nheat and irritation produced by these little wretches. Mosquitoes are\r\nannoying, piums are vexatious, but for concentrated misery commend me to\r\nthe Mocuim.\r\n\r\n_October 23d._—We left Teffé on Saturday evening on board the Icamiaba,\r\nwhich now seems quite like a home to us; we have passed so many pleasant\r\nhours in her comfortable quarters since we left Pará. We are just on the\r\nverge of the rainy season here, and almost every evening during the past\r\nweek has brought a thunder-storm. The evening before leaving Teffé we\r\nhad one of the most beautiful storms we have seen on the Amazons. It\r\ncame sweeping up from the east; these squalls always come from the east,\r\nand therefore the Indians say “the path of the sun is the path of the\r\nstorm.” The upper, lighter layer of cloud, travelling faster than the\r\ndark, lurid mass below, hung over it with its white, fleecy edge, like\r\nan avalanche of snow just about to fall. We were all sitting at the\r\ndoorstep watching its swift approach, and Mr. Agassiz said that this\r\ntropical storm was the most accurate representation of an avalanche on\r\nthe upper Alps he had ever seen. It seems sometimes as if Nature played\r\nupon herself, reproducing the same appearances under the most dissimilar\r\ncircumstances. It is curious to mark the change in the river. When we\r\nreached Teffé it was rapidly falling at the rate of about a foot a day.\r\nIt was easy to measure its retreat by the effect of the occasional rains\r\non the beach. The shower of one day, for instance, would gully the sand\r\nto the water’s edge, and the next day we would find the water about a\r\nfoot below the terminus of all the cracks and ruts thus caused, their\r\nabrupt close showing the line at which they met the water the previous\r\nday. Ten days or a fortnight before we left, and during which we had\r\nheavy rains at the close of every day, continuing frequently through the\r\nnight, those oscillations in the river began, which the people here call\r\n“repiquete,” and which, on the Upper Amazons, precede the regular rise\r\nof the water during the winter. The first repiquete occurs in Teffé\r\ntoward the end of October, accompanied by almost daily rains. After a\r\nweek or so the water falls again; in ten or twelve days it begins once\r\nmore to ascend, and sinks again after the same period. In some seasons\r\nthere is a third rise and fall, but usually the third repiquete begins\r\nthe permanent annual rise of the river. On board the steamer we were\r\njoined by Mr. Bourget, with his fine collections from Tabatinga. He,\r\nlike both the other parties, has been hindered, by want of alcohol, from\r\nmaking as large collections as he might otherwise have done; but they\r\nare, nevertheless, very valuable, exceedingly well put up, and embracing\r\na great variety of species, from the Marañon as well as from the\r\nHyavary. Thus we have a rich harvest from all the principal tributaries\r\nof the Upper Amazons, within the borders of Brazil, above the Rio Negro,\r\nexcept the Purus, which must be left unexplored for want of time and a\r\nsufficient working force.\r\n\r\nOn leaving Teffé I should say something of the nature of the soil in\r\nconnection with Mr. Agassiz’s previous observations on this subject.\r\nAlthough he has been almost constantly occupied with his collections, he\r\nhas, nevertheless, found time to examine the geological formations of\r\nthe neighborhood. The more he considers the Amazons and its tributaries,\r\nthe more does he feel convinced that the whole mass of the reddish,\r\nhomogeneous clay, which he has called drift, is the glacial deposit\r\nbrought down from the Andes and worked over by the melting of the ice\r\nwhich transported it. According to his view, the whole valley was\r\noriginally filled with this deposit, and the Amazons itself, as well as\r\nthe rivers connected with it, are so many channels worn through the\r\nmass, having cut their way just as the igarapé now wears its way through\r\nthe more modern deposits of mud and sand. It may seem strange that any\r\none should compare the formation of these insignificant forest-streams\r\nwith that of the vast river which pours itself across a whole continent;\r\nbut it is, after all, only a reversal of the microscopic process of\r\ninvestigation. We magnify the microscopically small in order to see it,\r\nand we must diminish that which transcends our apprehension by its great\r\nsize, in order to understand it. The naturalist who wishes to compare an\r\nelephant with a Coni (Hyrax),[76] turns the diminishing end of his glass\r\nupon the former, and, reducing its clumsy proportions, he finds that the\r\ndifference is one of size rather than structure. The essential features\r\nare the same. So the little igarapé, as it wears its channel through the\r\nforest to-day, explains the early history of the great river and feebly\r\nreiterates the past.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 68:\r\n\r\n  It is a curious fact, that though a large number of cows were owned in\r\n  Teffé, and were constantly seen feeding about the houses, milk was\r\n  among the unattainable luxuries. Indeed, milk is little used in\r\n  Brazil, so far as our observation goes. It is thought unhealthy for\r\n  children, and people will rather give coffee or tea to a two-year-old\r\n  baby than pure milk. The cows are never milked regularly, but the\r\n  quantity needed for the moment is drawn at any time.\r\n\r\nFootnote 69:\r\n\r\n                                              TEFFÉ, September 22, 1865.\r\n\r\n  MY DEAR FRIEND AND HONORED COLLEAGUE:—Here I have been for two months\r\n  in the basin of the Amazons, and it is here that I have heard with\r\n  sorrow of the death of my old friend Valenciennes. I am the more\r\n  affected by it, because no one would have appreciated more than he the\r\n  results of my journey, which I had hoped soon to share with him. You\r\n  will naturally understand that it is to the class of fishes I\r\n  consecrate the better part of my time, and my harvest exceeds all my\r\n  anticipations. You will judge of it by a few statements.\r\n\r\n  On reaching Manaos, at the junction of the Rio Negro and the Amazons,\r\n  I had already collected more than three hundred species of fishes,\r\n  half of which have been painted from life, that is, from the fish\r\n  swimming in a large glass tank before my artist. I am often pained to\r\n  see how carelessly colored plates of these animals have been\r\n  published. Not only have we tripled the number of species, but I count\r\n  new genera by dozens, and I have five or six new families for the\r\n  Amazons, and one allied to the Gobioides entirely new to Ichthyology.\r\n  Among the small species especially I have found novelties. I have\r\n  Characines of five or six centimetres and less, adorned with the most\r\n  beautiful tints, Cyprinodonts resembling a little those of Cuba and\r\n  the United States, Scomberesoces allied to the Belone of the\r\n  Mediterranean, a considerable number of Carapoides, and Rays of\r\n  different genera from those of the ocean, and therefore not species\r\n  which ascend the river; and a crowd of Goniodonts and Chromides of\r\n  unpublished genera and species. But what I appreciate most highly is\r\n  the facility I have for studying the changes which all these fishes\r\n  undergo with age and the differences of sex among them; which are\r\n  often very considerable. Thus I have observed a species of Geophagus\r\n  in which the male has a very conspicuous protuberance on the forehead,\r\n  wholly wanting in the female and the young. This same fish has a most\r\n  extraordinary mode of reproduction. The eggs pass, I know not how,\r\n  into the mouth, the bottom of which is lined by them, between the\r\n  inner appendages of the branchial arches, and especially into a pouch,\r\n  formed by the upper pharyngials, which they completely fill. There\r\n  they are hatched, and the little ones, freed from the egg-case, are\r\n  developed until they are in a condition to provide for their own\r\n  existence. I do not yet know how long this continues; but I have\r\n  already met with specimens whose young had no longer any vitelline\r\n  sac, but were still harbored by the progenitor. As I shall still pass\r\n  a month at Teffé I hope to be able to complete this observation. The\r\n  examination of the structure of a great number of Chromides has led me\r\n  to perceive the affinities between these fishes and several other\r\n  families with which we have never thought of associating them. In the\r\n  first place, I have convinced myself that the Chromides, formerly\r\n  scattered among the Labroides and the Sciænoids, really constitute a\r\n  natural group recognized nearly at the same time and in an independent\r\n  manner by Heckel and J. Müller. But, beside these, there are the\r\n  genera Enoplosus, Pomotis, Centrarchus, and some other neighboring\r\n  genera, classed among the Percoids by all Ichthyologists, which seem\r\n  to me, from this distance and without means of direct comparison, so\r\n  near the Chromides that I do not see how they can be separated,\r\n  especially now that I know the lower pharyngials not to be invariably\r\n  soldered in the Chromides. And then the embryology and metamorphoses\r\n  of the Chromides, which I have just been studying, have convinced me\r\n  that the fishes with labyrinthic branchiæ, separated from all other\r\n  fishes by Cuvier, as a family entirely isolated on account of the\r\n  strange structure of its respiratory organs, are closely related to\r\n  the Chromides. Thus this group becomes, by its various affinities, one\r\n  of the most interesting of the class of fishes, and the basin of the\r\n  Amazons seems to be the true home of this family. I will not fatigue\r\n  you with my ichthyological researches; let me only add, that the\r\n  fishes are not uniformly spread over this great basin. I have already\r\n  acquired the certainty that we must distinguish several ichthyological\r\n  faunæ very clearly characterized. Thus the species inhabiting the\r\n  river of Pará, from the borders of the sea to the mouth of the\r\n  Tocantins, differ from those which are met in the network of\r\n  anastomoses uniting the river of Pará with the Amazons proper. The\r\n  species of the Amazons below the Xingu differ from those which occur\r\n  higher up; those of the lower course of the Xingu differ from those of\r\n  the lower course of the Tapajoz. Those of the numerous igarapés and\r\n  lakes of Manaos differ as much from those of the principal course of\r\n  the great river and of its great affluents. It remains now to study\r\n  the changes which may take place in this distribution in the course of\r\n  the year, according to the height of the waters, and perhaps also\r\n  according to the epoch at which the different species lay their eggs.\r\n  Thus far I have met but a small number of species having a very\r\n  extensive area of distribution. One of those is the Sudis gigas, found\r\n  almost everywhere. It is the most important fish of the river, that\r\n  which, as food, corresponds to cattle for the population along the\r\n  banks. Another problem to be solved is, how far this phenomenon of the\r\n  local distribution of fishes is repeated in the great affluents of the\r\n  Amazons. I shall try to solve it in ascending the Rio Negro and Rio\r\n  Madeira, and as I return to Manaos I shall be able to compare my first\r\n  observations in this locality with those of another season of the\r\n  year. Adieu, my dear friend. Remember me to M. Elie de Beaumont and to\r\n  those of my colleagues of the Academy who are interested in my present\r\n  studies. My kind remembrance also to your son.\r\n\r\n                                             Always yours,\r\n\r\n                                                             L. AGASSIZ.\r\n\r\nFootnote 70:\r\n\r\n  We found that this information was incorrect, at least for some\r\n  species, as will be seen hereafter. I let the statement stand in the\r\n  text, however, as an instance of the difficulty one has in getting\r\n  correct facts, and the danger of trusting to the observations even of\r\n  people who mean to tell the real truth. No doubt some of these Acaras\r\n  do occasionally deposit their young in the sand, and continue a\r\n  certain care of them till they are able to shift for themselves. But\r\n  the story of the fisherman was one of those half truths as likely to\r\n  mislead, as if it had been wholly false. I will add here a few details\r\n  concerning these Acaras, a name applied by the natives to all the\r\n  oval-shaped Chromides. The species which lay their eggs in the sand\r\n  belong to the genera Hydrogonus and Chætobranchus. Like the North\r\n  American Pomotis, they build a kind of flat nest in the sand or mud,\r\n  in which they deposit their eggs, hovering over them until the young\r\n  are hatched. The species which carry their young in the mouth belong\r\n  to several genera, formerly all included under the name of Geophagus\r\n  by Heckel. I could not ascertain how the eggs are brought into the\r\n  mouth, but the change must take place soon after they are laid, for I\r\n  have found in that position eggs in which the embryo had just begun\r\n  its development as well as those in a more advanced stage of growth.\r\n  Occasionally, instead of eggs, I have found the cavity of the gills,\r\n  as also the space enclosed by the branchiostegal membrane, filled with\r\n  a brood of young already hatched. The eggs before hatching are always\r\n  found in the same part of the mouth, namely, in the upper part of the\r\n  branchial arches, protected or held together by a special lobe or\r\n  valve formed of the upper pharyngeals. The cavity thus occupied by the\r\n  eggs corresponds exactly to the labyrinth of that curious family of\r\n  fishes inhabiting the East Indian Ocean, called Labyrinthici by\r\n  Cuvier. This circumstance induces me to believe that the branchial\r\n  labyrinth of the eastern fishes may be a breeding pouch, like that of\r\n  our Chromides, and not simply a respiratory apparatus for retaining\r\n  water. In the Amazonian fish a very sensitive network of nerves\r\n  spreads over this marsupial pouch, the principal stem of which arises\r\n  from a special nervous ganglion, back of the cerebellum, in the\r\n  medulla oblongata. This region of the central nervous system is\r\n  strangely developed in different families of fishes, and sends out\r\n  nerves performing very varied functions. From it arise, normally, the\r\n  nerves of movement and sensation about the face; it also provides the\r\n  organs of breathing, the upper part of the alimentary canal, the\r\n  throat and the stomach. In the electric fishes the great nerves\r\n  entering the electric battery arise from the same cerebral region, and\r\n  now I have found that the pouch in which the egg of the Acara is\r\n  incubated and its young nursed for a time, receives its nerves from\r\n  the same source. This series of facts is truly wonderful, and only\r\n  shows how far our science still is from an apprehension of the\r\n  functions of the nervous system.—L. A.\r\n\r\nFootnote 71:\r\n\r\n  It is a very general habit among the South American Indians to pierce\r\n  the nose, ears, and lips with holes, in which they hang pieces of wood\r\n  and feathers, as ornaments.\r\n\r\nFootnote 72:\r\n\r\n  See “Expeditions into the Valley of the Amazons,” published by the\r\n  Hakluyt Society.\r\n\r\nFootnote 73:\r\n\r\n  This species belongs to one of the subdivisions of the genus\r\n  Auchenipterus; it is undescribed, and Mr. Burkhardt has made five\r\n  colored sketches of a number of specimens of different sizes, varying\r\n  in their markings.—L. A.\r\n\r\nFootnote 74:\r\n\r\n  When I attempted to record my impression of the basin of the Amazons,\r\n  and characterized it as a fresh-water ocean with an archipelago of\r\n  islands, I did not mean to limit the comparison to the wide expanse of\r\n  water and the large number of islands. The resemblance extends much\r\n  further, and the whole basin may be said to be oceanic also, in the\r\n  character of its fauna. It is true, we are accustomed to consider the\r\n  Chromides, the Characines, the Siluroids, and the Goniodonts, which\r\n  constitute the chief population of this network of rivers, as\r\n  fresh-water fishes; but in so doing we shut our eyes to their natural\r\n  affinities, and remember only the medium in which they live. Let any\r\n  one enter upon a more searching comparison, and he will not fail to\r\n  perceive that, under the name of Chromides, fishes are united which in\r\n  their form and general appearance recall several families of the\r\n  class, only known as inhabitants of the sea. The genus Pterophyllum,\r\n  for instance, might be placed side by side with the Chætodonts,\r\n  without apparently violating its natural affinities, since even Cuvier\r\n  considered it as a Platax. The genera Symphysodon and Uaru would not\r\n  seem very much out of place, by the side of Brama. The genus Geophagus\r\n  and allied forms recall at once the Sparoids, with which some of them\r\n  were associated by earlier ichthyologists; while the genus Crenicichla\r\n  forms a striking counterpart to the genus Malacanthus. Finally, the\r\n  genus Acara and their kindred closely resemble the Pomacentroids.\r\n  Indeed, had not the fresh-water genera Pomotis, Centrarchus, and the\r\n  like, been erroneously associated with the Percoids, the intimate\r\n  relations which bind them to the Chromides, and these again to the\r\n  marine types mentioned above, would long ago have been acknowledged.\r\n  The genus Monocirrus is a miniature Toxotes, with a barbel.\r\n  Polycentrus, which is also found in the Amazons, stands nearest to\r\n  Acara and Heros; it has only a larger number of anal spines. In this\r\n  connection it ought not to be overlooked that these fishes are not\r\n  pelagic, like the Scomberoids, but rather archipelagic, if I may use\r\n  this word to designate fishes dwelling among low islands. If we\r\n  discard the long-prevailing idea of a close relationship between the\r\n  Characines and Salmonides, based solely upon the presence of an\r\n  adipose fin, we may at once perceive how manifold are the affinities\r\n  between the Characines on one hand, and on the other the Scopelines\r\n  and Clupeoids, all of which are essentially marine. These relations\r\n  may be traced to the details of the genera; Gasteropelecus, from the\r\n  family of Characines, is the pendant of Pristigaster among the\r\n  Clupeoids, as Chalcinus recalls Pellona. In the same way may Stomias\r\n  and Chauliodus be compared to Cynodon and the like; or Sudis and\r\n  Osteoglossum to Megalops, and Erythrinus to Ophicephalus, &c., &c. The\r\n  Goniodonts may at first sight hardly seem to have any kindred among\r\n  marine fishes; but if we take into account the affinity which\r\n  unquestionably links the genus Loricaria and its allies with Pegasus,\r\n  and further remember that to this day all the ichthyologists, with the\r\n  sole exception of C. Duméril, have united Pegasus in one order with\r\n  the Pipe-fishes, it will no longer be doubted that the Goniodonts have\r\n  at least a remarkable analogy with the Lophobranches, if they should\r\n  not be considered as bearing a close structural relation to them. But\r\n  this relation truly exists. The extraordinary mode of rearing their\r\n  young, which characterizes the various representatives of the old\r\n  genus Syngnathus, is only matched by the equally curious incubation of\r\n  the eggs in Loricaria. And as to the other families represented in the\r\n  basin of the Amazons, such as the Skates, the Sharks, the Tetraodonts,\r\n  the Flat-fishes (Pleuronectides), the Bill-fishes (Scomberesoces), the\r\n  Anchovis, Herrings, and other forms of the family of Clupeoids, the\r\n  Murænoids, the genuine Sciænoids, the Gobioids, &c., &c., they are\r\n  chiefly known as marine types; while the Cyprinodonts occur elsewhere\r\n  both in salt and fresh water. The Gymnotines are thus far only known\r\n  as fresh-water fishes, nor do I see any ground for comparing them to\r\n  any marine type. They cannot be compared to the Murænoids, with which\r\n  they have thus far been associated. The only real affinity I can trace\r\n  in them is with the Mormyri of the Nile and Senegal, and with the\r\n  Notopteri of the Sunda Islands. Eel-shaped fishes are by no means all\r\n  related to one another, and their elongated form, with a variety of\r\n  patterns, is no indication of their relationship. It may,\r\n  nevertheless, be inferred from what precedes, that the fishes of the\r\n  Amazons have, as a whole, a marine character peculiarly their own, and\r\n  not at all to be met with among the inhabitants of the other great\r\n  rivers of the world.\r\n\r\n  These peculiarities extend to other classes besides fishes. Among the\r\n  Bivalve shells, it has long been known that the Amazons nourishes\r\n  genera of Naiades peculiar to its waters, or only found besides in the\r\n  other great rivers of South America; such as Hyria, Castalia, and\r\n  Mycetopus, to which I would add another genus, founded upon slender,\r\n  sickle-shaped Unios, common to North and South America. But what seems\r\n  to have escaped the attention of conchologists is the striking\r\n  resemblance of Hyria and Avicula, of Castalia and Arca, of Mycetopus\r\n  and Solen, &c. Thus exhibiting another repetition of marine types in a\r\n  family exclusively limited to fresh waters, and having structural\r\n  characters of its own, entirely distinct from the marine genera, the\r\n  appearance of which they so closely ape. In this connection I cannot\r\n  suppress the remark, that it would be puerile to consider such mimicry\r\n  as indicative of a community of origin. Some of the land shells even\r\n  recall marine forms; such are some of the Bulimus tribe, which\r\n  resemble the genus Phasianella and Littorina far more than their own\r\n  relatives. The similarity of the fringes of the anterior margin of the\r\n  foot is particularly striking. The Ampullariæ remind one also, in a\r\n  measure, of the marine genera Struthiolaria, Natica, &c., and many\r\n  fossils of the latter family have been confounded with fresh-water\r\n  Ampullariæ.\r\n\r\n  The most noticeable feature of the Amazonian fauna, considered with\r\n  reference to its oceanic character, is, however, the abundance of\r\n  Cetaceans through its whole extent. Wherever I have navigated these\r\n  waters, from Pará, where the tides still send the salt brine up the\r\n  river, to Tabatinga on the borders of Peru, in all the larger and\r\n  smaller tributaries of the great stream as well as in the many lakes\r\n  connected with their ever-changing course, I have seen and heard them,\r\n  gamboling at the surface and snoring rhythmically, when undisturbed in\r\n  their breathing. At night, especially, when quietly at anchor in the\r\n  river, you hardly ever fail to be startled by the noise they make,\r\n  when reaching the surface to exhale forcibly the air they have long\r\n  retained in their lungs while under water. I have noticed five\r\n  different species of this order of animals in the waters of the\r\n  Amazons, four of which belong to the family of Porpoises and one to\r\n  that of Manatees. Mr. Burkhardt has drawn three of them from fresh\r\n  specimens for me, and I hope before long to secure equally faithful\r\n  representations of the others, when I shall describe them all\r\n  comparatively. One of the Porpoises belongs to the genus Inia, and may\r\n  be traced on the upper tributaries of the Amazons to Bolivia, another\r\n  resembles more our common Porpoise, while still another recalls the\r\n  Dolphin of the sea-coast; but I have been unable to ascertain whether\r\n  any one of them is identical with the marine species. At all events,\r\n  the black Porpoise of the bay of Marajo, frequently seen in the\r\n  vicinity of Pará, is totally different from the gray species seen\r\n  higher up the stream.—L. A.\r\n\r\nFootnote 75:\r\n\r\n  As from the beginning our arrangements were made to stay at least a\r\n  month in Teffé, it became possible to lay out our work in a more\r\n  systematic form than during our rambling travels. It was here that I\r\n  secured the largest number of fish skeletons and had several of the\r\n  larger animals of the country prepared for the Museum; such as\r\n  Manatees, Porpoises, Pirarucus, Sorubims, and the like. I also\r\n  undertook here, for the first time, a regular search for the young of\r\n  all the species of fishes that could be obtained. Here again my\r\n  neighbors, and indeed all the inhabitants of the place, vied with one\r\n  another in their efforts to procure specimens for me. Senhor Joaō da\r\n  Cunha and Dr. Romualdo made frequent fishing excursions for my\r\n  benefit; and when I could not accompany them, a boatful of fish was\r\n  nevertheless moored to the shore, in the evening, from which I could\r\n  select whatever was useful or interesting. The grocer of the place,\r\n  Mr. Pedro Mendez, who employed a skilful fisherman daily to supply his\r\n  large family, gave directions that all the fishes caught should be\r\n  brought in, and before the kitchen received its provisions, I had my\r\n  choice of everything. This was a great favor, especially since the\r\n  Indian fisherman, José, whom I had engaged in Manaos to accompany me\r\n  through the rest of my journey, was now at Tabatinga, assisting Mr.\r\n  Bourget, who had been left there when I returned to Teffé. An old\r\n  Passé Indian, who was as familiar with the fishes of the waters as\r\n  with the animals of the forest, and whom Major Coutinho had befriended\r\n  for many years, rendered also great service in hunting particular\r\n  kinds of fishes and reptiles, the haunts of which he alone seemed to\r\n  know. The schoolmaster and his boys, in short, everybody who knew how\r\n  to catch fish or fowl, was out at work, and, with the assistance of my\r\n  young friends Dexter, Hunnewell, and Thayer, and the co-operation of\r\n  Major Coutinho and Mr. Burkhardt, our daily progress was unmistakable.\r\n  They generally took care of the collections of land animals, while I\r\n  reserved the fishes to myself, and Major Coutinho was busy with\r\n  geological and meteorological observations. Even the servants helped\r\n  in cleaning the skeletons. I made here a very extensive collection of\r\n  fish brains, embracing most genera found in this locality, but it was\r\n  unfortunately lost on arriving at Manaos. Aware of the difficulty of\r\n  transporting preparations so delicate, I kept them always by my side,\r\n  simply packed in an open barrel, in the hope of bringing them safely\r\n  home, and also that I might, without difficulty, add to the number. In\r\n  an unguarded moment, however, while landing, one of our attendants\r\n  capsized the whole into the Rio Negro. It is the only part of my\r\n  collections which was completely lost.\r\n\r\n  After setting my whole party well under way in Teffé, I made the very\r\n  instructive excursion with Major Estolano, of which an account is\r\n  given in the text, to the Lago do Boto, a small sheet of water, by the\r\n  side of his sitio on the banks of the main course of the Amazons,\r\n  where I had a fair opportunity of ascertaining how widely different\r\n  the fishes may be that inhabit adjoining faunæ in the same\r\n  hydrographic basin. To this day I have not yet recovered from my\r\n  surprise at finding that shores which, from a geographic point of\r\n  view, must be considered simply as opposite banks of the same stream,\r\n  were, nevertheless, the abode of an essentially different\r\n  ichthyological population. Among the most curious fishes obtained\r\n  here, I would mention a new genus, allied to Phractocephalus, of which\r\n  I know only a single very large species, remarkable for its uniform\r\n  canary-yellow color. Doras, Acestra, Pterygoplichthys, &c., were\r\n  particularly common. Small as this lake is, the largest animals known\r\n  in the whole basin are found in it: such as Manatees Botos,—the\r\n  Porpoise of the Amazons, which has given its name to the lake,\r\n  Alligators, Pirarucus,—the Sudis gigas of systematic writers;\r\n  Sorubims, the large flat-headed Hornpouts; Pacamums, the large, yellow\r\n  Siluroid above alluded to, &c., &c.—L. A.\r\n\r\nFootnote 76:\r\n\r\n  It was Cuvier who first ascertained that the small Hyrax belongs to\r\n  the same order as the elephant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII.\r\n                  RETURN TO MANAOS.—AMAZONIAN PICNIC.\r\n\r\n  ARRIVAL AT MANAOS.—NEW QUARTERS.—THE “IBICUHY.”—NEWS FROM\r\n    HOME.—VISIT TO THE CASCADE.—BANHEIRAS IN THE FOREST.—EXCURSION TO\r\n    LAKE HYANUARY.—CHARACTER AND PROSPECTS OF THE AMAZONIAN\r\n    VALLEY.—RECEPTION AT THE LAKE.—DESCRIPTION OF SITIO.—SUCCESSFUL\r\n    FISHING.—INDIAN VISITORS.—INDIAN BALL.—CHARACTER OF THE\r\n    DANCING.—DISTURBED NIGHT.—CANOE EXCURSION.—SCENERY.—ANOTHER\r\n    SITIO.—MORALS AND MANNERS.—TALK WITH THE INDIAN WOMEN.—LIFE IN THE\r\n    FOREST.—LIFE IN THE TOWNS.—DINNER-PARTY.—TOASTS.—EVENING ROW ON\r\n    THE LAKE.—NIGHT SCENE.—SMOKING AMONG THE SENHORAS.—RETURN TO\r\n    MANAOS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_October 24th._—Manaos. We reached Manaos yesterday. As we landed in the\r\nafternoon, and as our arrival had not been expected with any certainty,\r\nwe had to wait a little while for lodgings; but before night we were\r\nfairly established, our corps of assistants and all our scientific\r\napparatus, in a small house near the shore, Mr. Agassiz and myself in an\r\nold, rambling edifice, used when we were here before for the public\r\ntreasury, which is now removed to another building. Our abode has still\r\nrather the air of a public establishment, but it is very quaint and\r\npleasant inside, and, from its open, spacious character, is especially\r\nagreeable in this climate. The apartment in which we have taken up our\r\nquarters, making it serve both as drawing-room and chamber, is a long,\r\nlofty hall, opening by a number of doors and windows on a large, green\r\nenclosure, called by courtesy a garden, but which is, after all, only a\r\nragged space overgrown with grass, and having a few trees in it.\r\nNevertheless, it makes a pleasant background of shade and verdure. At\r\nthe upper end of our airy room hang our hammocks, and here are disposed\r\nour trunks, boxes, &c.; in the other half are a couple of\r\nwriting-tables, a Yankee rocking-chair that looks as if it might have\r\ncome out of a Maine farmer’s house, a lounging-chair, and one or two\r\nother pieces of furniture, which give it a domestic look and make it\r\nserve very well as a parlor. There are many other apartments in this\r\nrambling, rickety castle of ours, with its brick floors and its\r\nrat-holes, its lofty, bare walls, and rough rafters overhead; but this\r\nis the only one we have undertaken to make habitable, and to my eye it\r\npresents a very happy combination of the cosey and the picturesque. We\r\nhave been already urged by some of our hospitable friends here to take\r\nother lodgings; but we are much pleased with our quarters, and prefer to\r\nretain them, at least for the present.\r\n\r\nOn our arrival we were greeted by the tidings that the first steamer of\r\nthe line recently opened between New York and Brazil had touched at Pará\r\non her way to Rio. According to all accounts, this has been made the\r\noccasion of great rejoicing; and, indeed, there appears to be a strong\r\ndesire throughout Brazil to strengthen in every way her relations with\r\nthe United States. The opening of this line seems to bring us nearer\r\nhome, and its announcement, in connection with excellent news, public\r\nand private, from the United States, made the day of our return to\r\nManaos a very happy one. A few hours after our own arrival the steamer\r\n“Ibicuhy,” provided by the government for our use, came into port. To\r\nour great pleasure, she brings Mr. Tavares Bastos, deputy from Alagoas,\r\nwhose uniform kindness to us personally ever since our arrival in\r\nBrazil, as well as his interest in the success of the expedition, make\r\nit a great pleasure to meet him again. This morning Mr. Agassiz received\r\nthe official document placing the steamer at his disposition, and also a\r\nvisit from her commander, Captain Faria.\r\n\r\n_October 26th._—Yesterday morning at six o’clock we made our first\r\nexcursion to a pretty spot much talked of in Manaos on account of its\r\nattractions for bathing, picnics, and country enjoyments of all sorts.\r\nIt is called the “little cascade,” to distinguish it from a larger and,\r\nit is said, a much more picturesque fall, half a league from the city on\r\nthe other side. Half an hour’s row through a winding river brings you to\r\na rocky causeway, over which the water comes brawling down in a shallow\r\nrapid. Here you land, and a path through the trees leads along the edge\r\nof the igarapé to a succession of “banheiras,” as they call them here;\r\nand they are indeed woodland bathing-pools fit for Diana and her nymphs,\r\ncompletely surrounded by trees, and so separated from each other by\r\nleafy screens, that a number of persons may bathe in perfect seclusion.\r\nThe water rushes through them with a delicious freshness, forming a\r\nlittle cascade in each. The inhabitants make the most of this forest\r\nbathing establishment while it lasts; the rise of the river during the\r\nrainy season overflows and effaces it completely for half the year.\r\nWhile we were bathing, the boatmen had lighted a fire, and when we\r\nreturned to the landing we found a pot of coffee simmering very\r\ntemptingly over the embers. Thus refreshed, we returned to town just as\r\nthe heat of the day was beginning to be oppressive.\r\n\r\n_October 28th._—Yesterday morning, at about half past six o’clock, we\r\nleft Manaos on an excursion to the Lake of Hyanuary on the western side\r\nof the Rio Negro. The morning was unusually fresh for these latitudes,\r\nand a strong wind was blowing up so heavy a sea in the river, that, if\r\nit did not make one actually sea-sick, it certainly called up very vivid\r\nand painful associations. We were in a large eight-oared custom-house\r\nbarge, our company consisting of His Excellency Dr. Epaminondas,\r\nPresident of the province, his Secretary, Senhor Codicera, Senhor\r\nTavares Bastos, Major Coutinho, Mr. Agassiz and myself, Mr. Burkhardt,\r\nMr. Dexter, and Mr. James. We were preceded by a smaller boat, an Indian\r\nmontaria, in which was our friend Senhor Honorio, who has been so kind\r\nas to allow us to breakfast and dine with him during our stay here, and\r\nwho, having undertaken to provide for our creature comforts, had the\r\ncare of a boatful of provisions. After an hour’s row we left the rough\r\nwaters of the Rio Negro, and, rounding a wooded point, turned into an\r\nigarapé which gradually narrowed up into one of those shaded, winding\r\nstreams, which make the charm of such excursions in this country. A\r\nragged drapery of long, faded grass hung from the lower branches of the\r\ntrees, marking the height of the last rise of the river to some eighteen\r\nor twenty feet above its present level. Here and there a white heron\r\nstood on the shore, his snowy plumage glittering in the sunlight, and\r\nnumbers of Ciganas (Opistocomus), the pheasants of the Amazons,\r\nclustered in the bushes; once a pair of large king vultures\r\n(Sarcorhamphus papa) rested for a moment within gunshot, but flew out of\r\nsight as our canoe approached; and now and then an alligator showed his\r\nhead above water. As we floated along through this picturesque channel,\r\nso characteristic of the wonderful region to which we were all more or\r\nless strangers, Dr. Epaminondas and Senhor Tavares Bastos being here\r\nalso for the first time, the conversation turned naturally enough upon\r\nthe nature of this Amazonian valley, its physical conformation, its\r\norigin and resources, its history past and to come, both alike obscure,\r\nboth the subject of wonder and speculation. Senhor Tavares Bastos,\r\nalthough not yet thirty years of age, is already distinguished in the\r\npolitics of his country, and from the moment he entered upon public life\r\nto the present time the legislation of the Amazons, its relation to the\r\nfuture progress and development of the Brazilian Empire, have been the\r\nobject of his deepest interest. He is a leader in that class of men who\r\nadvocate the most liberal policy with regard to this question, and has\r\nalready urged upon his countrymen the importance, even from selfish\r\nmotives, of sharing their great treasure with the world. He was little\r\nmore than twenty years of age when he published his papers on the\r\nopening of the Amazons, which have done more, perhaps, than anything\r\nelse, of late years, to attract attention to the subject.[77] There are\r\npoints where the researches of the statesman and the investigator meet,\r\nand natural science is not without a voice even in the practical\r\nbearings of this question. Shall this region be legislated for as sea or\r\nland? Shall the interests of agriculture or navigation prevail in its\r\ncouncils? Is it essentially aquatic or terrestrial? Such were some of\r\nthe inquiries which came up in the course of the discussion. A region of\r\ncountry which stretches across a whole continent and is flooded for half\r\nthe year, where there can never be railroads or highways, or even\r\npedestrian travelling to any great extent, can hardly be considered as\r\ndry land. It is true that in this oceanic river-system the tidal action\r\nhas an annual instead of a daily ebb and flow, that its rise and fall\r\nobey a larger orb, and is ruled by the sun and not the moon; but it is,\r\nnevertheless, subject to all the conditions of a submerged district, and\r\nmust be treated as such. Indeed, these semiannual changes of level are\r\nfar more powerful in their influence on the life of the inhabitants than\r\nany marine tides. People sail half the year above districts where for\r\nthe other half they walk, though hardly dry shod, over the soaked\r\nground; their occupations, their dress, their habits are modified in\r\naccordance with the dry and wet seasons. And not only the ways of life,\r\nbut the whole aspect of the country, the character of the landscape, are\r\nchanged. The two picturesque cascades, at one of which we took our bath\r\nthe other morning, and at this season such favorite resorts with the\r\ninhabitants of Manaos, will disappear in a few months, when the river\r\nrises for some forty feet above its lowest level. Their bold rocks and\r\nshady nooks will have become river bottom. All that we hear or read of\r\nthe extent of the Amazons and its tributaries fails to give an idea of\r\nits immensity as a whole. One must float for months upon its surface, in\r\norder to understand how fully water has the mastery over land along its\r\nborders. Its watery labyrinth is rather a fresh-water ocean, cut up and\r\ndivided by land, than a network of rivers. Indeed, this whole valley is\r\nan aquatic, not a terrestrial basin; and it is not strange, when looked\r\nupon from this point of view, that its forests should be less full of\r\nlife, comparatively, than its rivers.\r\n\r\nWhile we were discussing these points, talking of the time when the\r\nbanks of the Amazons will teem with a population more active and\r\nvigorous than any it has yet seen,—when all civilized nations will share\r\nin its wealth, when the twin continents will shake hands and Americans\r\nof the North come to help Americans of the South in developing its\r\nresources,—when it will be navigated from north to south as well as from\r\neast to west, and small steamers will run up to the head-quarters of all\r\nits tributaries,—while we were speculating on these things, we were\r\napproaching the end of our journey; and as we neared the lake, there\r\nissued from its entrance a small two-masted canoe, evidently bound on\r\nsome official mission, for it carried the Brazilian flag, and was\r\nadorned with many brightly-colored streamers. As it drew near we heard\r\nmusic, and a salvo of rockets, the favorite Brazilian artillery on all\r\nfestive occasions, whether by day or night, shot up into the air. Our\r\narrival had been announced by Dr. Canavaro, of Manaos, who had come out\r\nthe day before to make some preparations for our reception, and this was\r\na welcome to the President on his first visit to the Indian village.\r\nWhen they came within speaking distance, a succession of hearty cheers\r\nwent up for the President, for Tavares Bastos, whose character as the\r\npolitical advocate of the Amazons makes him especially welcome here, for\r\nMajor Coutinho, already well known from his former explorations in this\r\nregion, and for the strangers within their gates,—for the Professor and\r\nhis party. After this reception they fell into line behind our boat, and\r\nso we came into the little port with something of state and ceremony.\r\n\r\nThis pretty Indian village is hardly recognized as a village at once,\r\nfor it consists of a number of sitios scattered through the forest; and\r\nthough the inhabitants look on each other as friends and neighbors, yet\r\nfrom our landing-place only one sitio is to be seen,—that at which we\r\nare staying. It stands on a hill sloping gently up from the lake-shore,\r\nand consists of a mud-house containing two rooms, besides several large,\r\nopen palm-thatched rooms outside. One of these outer sheds is the\r\nmandioca kitchen, another is the common kitchen, and a third, which is\r\njust now used as our dining-room, serves on festal days and occasional\r\nSundays as a chapel. It differs from the others in having the upper end\r\nclosed in with a neat thatched wall, against which, in time of need, the\r\naltar-table may stand, with candles and rough prints or figures of the\r\nVirgin and saints. We were very hospitably received by the Senhora of\r\nthe mud-house, an old Indian woman, whose gold ornaments, necklace, and\r\near-rings were rather out of keeping with her calico skirt and cotton\r\nwaist. This is, however, by no means an unusual combination here. Beside\r\nthe old lady, the family consists, at this moment, of her “afilhada”[78]\r\n(god-daughter), with her little boy, and several other women employed\r\nabout the place; but it is difficult to judge of the population of the\r\nsitios now, because a great number of the men have been taken as\r\nrecruits for the war with Paraguay and others are hiding in the forest\r\nfor fear of being pressed into the same service. The situation of this\r\nsitio is exceedingly pretty, and as we sit around the table in our open,\r\nairy dining-room, surrounded by the forest, we command a view of the\r\nlake and wooded hillside opposite and of the little landing below, where\r\nare moored our barge with its white awning, the gay canoe, and two or\r\nthree Indian montarias. After breakfast our party dispersed, some to\r\nrest in their hammocks, others to hunt or fish, while Mr. Agassiz was\r\nfully engaged in examining a large basket of fish, Tucanarés (Cichla),\r\nAcaras (Heros and other genera), Curimatas (Anodus), Surubims\r\n(Platystoma), &c., just brought up from the lake for his inspection, and\r\nshowing again, what every investigation demonstrates afresh, namely, the\r\ndistinct localization of species in each different water basin, be it\r\nriver, lake, igarapé, or forest pool.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Dining Room at Hyanuary.]\r\n\r\nOne does not see much of the world between one o’clock and four, in this\r\nclimate. These are the hottest hours of the day, and there are few who\r\ncan resist the temptation of the cool, swinging hammock, slung in some\r\nshady spot within doors or without. After a little talk with our Indian\r\nhostess and her daughter, I found a quiet retreat by the lake-shore,\r\nwhere, though I had a book in my hand, the wind in the trees overhead,\r\nthe water rippling softly around the montarias moored at my side, lulled\r\nme into that mood of mind when one may be lazy without remorse or ennui.\r\nThe highest duty seems then to be to do nothing. The monotonous notes of\r\na “Viola” came to me from a group of trees at a little distance, where\r\nour boatmen were resting in the shade, the red fringes of their hammocks\r\ngiving to the landscape just the bit of color which it needed;\r\noccasionally a rustling flight of parroquets or ciganas overhead\r\nstartled me for a moment, or a large pirarucu plashed out of the water,\r\nbut except for these sounds nature was still, and animals as well as men\r\nseemed to pause in the heat and seek shelter. Dinner brought us all\r\ntogether again at the close of the afternoon. As we are with the\r\nPresident of the province, our picnic is of a much more magnificent\r\ncharacter than our purely scientific excursions have been. Instead of\r\nour usual makeshifts,—teacups doing duty as tumblers, and empty barrels\r\nacting as chairs,—we have a silver soup-tureen, and a cook, and a\r\nwaiter, and knives and forks enough to go round, and many other luxuries\r\nwhich such wayfarers as ourselves learn to do without. While we were\r\ndining, the Indians began to come in from the surrounding forest to pay\r\ntheir respects to the President, for his visit was the cause of great\r\nrejoicing, and there was to be a ball in his honor in the evening. They\r\nbrought an enormous cluster of game as an offering. What a mass of color\r\nit was!—more like a gorgeous bouquet of flowers than a bunch of birds.\r\nIt was composed entirely of Toucans, with their red and yellow beaks,\r\nblue eyes, and soft white breasts bordered with crimson; and of parrots,\r\nor papagaios as they call them here, with their gorgeous plumage of\r\ngreen, blue, purple, and red. When we had dined, we took coffee outside,\r\nwhile our places around the table were filled by the Indian guests, who\r\nwere to have a dinner-party in their turn. It was pleasant to see with\r\nhow much courtesy several of the Brazilian gentlemen of our party waited\r\nupon these Indian Senhoras, passing them a variety of dishes, helping\r\nthem to wine, and treating them with as much attention as if they had\r\nbeen the highest ladies of the land. They seemed, however, rather shy\r\nand embarrassed, scarcely touching the nice things placed before them,\r\ntill one of the gentlemen, who has lived a good deal among the Indians,\r\nand knows their habits perfectly, took the knife and fork from one of\r\nthem, exclaiming, “Make no ceremony, and don’t be ashamed; eat with your\r\nfingers as you’re accustomed to do, and then you’ll find your appetites\r\nand enjoy your dinner.” His advice was followed, and I must say they\r\nseemed much more comfortable in consequence, and did more justice to the\r\ngood fare. Although the Indians who live in the neighborhood of the\r\ntowns have seen too much of the conventionalities of life not to\r\nunderstand the use of a knife and fork, no Indian will eat with one if\r\nhe can help it.\r\n\r\nWhen the dinner was over, the room was cleared of the tables and swept;\r\nthe music, consisting of a viola, flute, and violin, was called in, and\r\nthe ball was opened. The forest belles were rather shy at first in the\r\npresence of strangers; but they soon warmed up and began to dance with\r\nmore animation. They were all dressed in calico or muslin skirts, with\r\nloose, cotton waists, finished around the neck with a kind of lace they\r\nmake themselves by drawing the threads from cotton or muslin, so as to\r\nform an open pattern, sewing those which remain over and over to secure\r\nthem. Some of this lace is quite elaborate and very fine. Many of the\r\nwomen had their hair dressed either with white jessamine or with roses\r\nstuck into their round combs, and several wore gold beads and ear-rings.\r\nThe dances were different from those I saw in Esperança’s cottage, and\r\nmuch more animated; but the women preserved the same air of quiet\r\nindifference which I noticed there. Indeed, in all the Indian dances I\r\nhave seen the man makes the advances, while the woman is coy and\r\nretiring, her movements being very languid. Her partner throws himself\r\nat her feet, but does not elicit a smile or a gesture; he stoops and\r\npretends to be fishing; making motions as if he were drawing her in with\r\na line, he dances around her, snapping his fingers as if he were playing\r\non castanets, and half encircling her with his arms, but she remains\r\nreserved and cold. Now and then they join together in something like a\r\nwaltz, but this is only occasionally and for a moment. How different\r\nfrom the negro dances which we saw frequently in the neighborhood of\r\nRio, and in which the advances generally come from the women, and are\r\nnot always of the most modest character. The ball was gayer than ever at\r\nten o’clock when I went to my room,—or rather to the room where my\r\nhammock was slung, and which I shared with Indian women and children,\r\nwith a cat and her family of kittens, who slept on the edge of my\r\nmosquito-net and made frequent inroads upon the inside, with hens and\r\nchickens and sundry dogs, who went in and out. The music and dancing,\r\nthe laughter and talking outside, continued till the small hours. Every\r\nnow and then an Indian girl would come in to rest for a while, take a\r\nnap in a hammock, and then return to the dance. When we first arrived in\r\nSouth America we could hardly have slept soundly under such\r\ncircumstances; but one soon becomes accustomed, on the Amazons, to\r\nsleeping in rooms with mud floors and mud walls, or with no walls at\r\nall, where rats and birds and bats rustle about in the thatch overhead,\r\nand all sorts of unwonted noises in the night suggest that you are by no\r\nmeans the sole occupant of your apartment. There is one thing, however,\r\nwhich makes it far pleasanter to lodge in the houses of the Indians here\r\nthan in those of our poorer class at home. One is quite independent in\r\nthe matter of bedding; nobody travels without his own hammock, and the\r\nnet which in many places is a necessity on account of the mosquitoes.\r\nBeds and bedding are almost unknown; and there are none so poor as not\r\nto possess two or three of the strong and neat twine hammocks made by\r\nthe Indians themselves from the fibres of the palm. Then the open\r\ncharacter of the houses and the personal cleanliness of the Indians make\r\nthe atmosphere fresher and purer in their houses than in those of our\r\npoor. However untidy they may be in other respects, they always bathe\r\nonce or twice a day, if not oftener, and wash their clothes frequently.\r\nWe have never yet entered an Indian house where there was any\r\ndisagreeable odor, unless it might be the peculiar smell from the\r\npreparation of the mandioca in the working-room outside, which has, at a\r\ncertain stage of the process, a slightly sour smell. We certainly could\r\nnot say as much for many houses where we have lodged when travelling in\r\nthe West, or even “Down East,” where the suspicious look of the bedding\r\nand the close air of the room often make one doubtful about the night’s\r\nrest.\r\n\r\nThis morning we were up at five o’clock, and at six we had had coffee\r\nand were ready for the various projects suggested for our amusement. Our\r\nsportsmen were already in the forest, others had gone off on a fishing\r\nexcursion in a montaria, and I joined a party on a visit to a sitio\r\nhigher up on the lake. Mr. Agassiz was obliged to deny himself all these\r\nparties of pleasure, for the novelty and variety of the fish brought in\r\nkept him and his artist constantly at work. In this climate the process\r\nof decomposition goes on so rapidly, that, unless the specimens are\r\nattended to at once, they are lost; and the paintings must be made while\r\nthey are quite fresh, in order to give any idea of their vividness of\r\ntint. Mr. Burkhardt is indefatigable, always busy with his drawing, in\r\nspite of heat, mosquitoes, and other discomforts; occasionally he makes\r\nnot less than twenty colored sketches of fishes in one day. Of course,\r\nmade with such rapidity, they are mere records of color and outline; but\r\nthey will be of immense service in working up the finished drawings.[79]\r\nLeaving Mr. Agassiz, therefore, busy with the preparation of his\r\ncollections, and Mr. Burkhardt painting, we went up the lake through a\r\nstrange, half-aquatic, half-terrestrial region, where land seemed at\r\nodds with water. Groups of trees rose directly from the lake, their\r\nroots hidden below its surface, while numerous blackened and decayed\r\ntrunks stood up from the water in all sorts of picturesque and fantastic\r\nforms. Sometimes the trees had thrown down from their branches those\r\nsingular aerial roots so common here, and seemed standing on stilts.\r\nHere and there, where we coasted along by the bank, we had a glimpse\r\ninto the deeper forest, with its drapery of lianas and various creeping\r\nvines, and its parasitic sipos twining close around the trunks or\r\nswinging themselves from branch to branch like loose cordage. But\r\nusually the margin of the lake was a gently sloping bank, covered with a\r\ngreen so vivid and yet so soft, that it seemed as if the earth had been\r\nborn afresh in its six months’ baptism, and had come out like a new\r\ncreation. Here and there a palm lifted its head above the line of\r\nforest, especially the light, graceful Assai, its crown of feathery\r\nleaves vibrating above the tall, slender, smooth stem with every breeze.\r\nHalf an hour’s row brought us to the landing of the sitio for which we\r\nwere bound. Usually the sitios stand on the bank of the lake or river, a\r\nstone’s throw from the shore, for convenience of fishing, bathing, &c.\r\nBut this one was at some distance, with a very nicely kept path winding\r\nthrough the forest. It stood on the brow of a hill which dipped down on\r\nthe other side into a wide and deep ravine; through this ravine ran an\r\nigarapé, beyond which the land rose again in an undulating line of hilly\r\nground, most refreshing to the eye after the flat character of the Upper\r\nAmazonian scenery. The fact that this sitio, standing now on a hill\r\noverlooking the valley and the little stream at its bottom, will have\r\nthe water nearly flush with the ground around it, when the igarapé is\r\nswollen by the rise of the river, gives an idea of the difference of\r\naspect between the dry and wet seasons. The establishment consisted of a\r\nnumber of buildings, the most conspicuous being a large open room, which\r\nthe Indian Senhora who did the honors of the house told me was their\r\nreception-room, and was often used, she said, by the “brancas” from\r\nManaos and the neighborhood for an evening dance, when they came out in\r\na large company and passed the night. A low wall, some three or four\r\nfeet in height, ran along the sides, wooden benches being placed against\r\nthem for their whole length. The two ends were closed from top to bottom\r\nwith a wall made of palm-thatch, exceedingly pretty, fine, and smooth,\r\nand of a soft straw color. At the upper end stood an immense\r\nembroidery-frame, looking as if it might have served for Penelope’s web,\r\nbut in which was stretched an unfinished hammock of palm-thread, the\r\nSenhora’s work. She sat down on a low stool before it and worked a\r\nlittle for my benefit, showing me how the two layers of transverse\r\nthreads were kept apart by a thick, polished piece of wood, something\r\nlike a long, broad ruler. Through the opening thus made the shuttle is\r\npassed with the cross thread, which is then pushed down and straightened\r\nin its place by means of the same piece of wood. After we had rested for\r\na while, hammocks of various color and texture being immediately brought\r\nand hung up for our accommodation, the gentlemen went down to bathe in\r\nthe igarapé, while the Senhora and her daughter, a very pretty Indian\r\nwoman, showed me the rest of the establishment. The elder of the two had\r\nthe direction of everything now, as the master of the house was absent,\r\nhaving a captain’s commission in the army.\r\n\r\nIn the course of our conversation I was reminded of a social feature\r\nwhich strikes us as the more extraordinary the longer we remain on the\r\nAmazons, on account of its generality. Here were people of gentle\r\ncondition, although of Indian blood, lifted above everything like want,\r\nliving in comfort and, as compared with people about them, with a\r\ncertain affluence,—people from whom, therefore, in any other society,\r\nyou might certainly expect a knowledge of the common rules of morality.\r\nYet when I was introduced to the daughter, and naturally asked something\r\nabout her father, supposing him to be the absent captain, the mother\r\nanswered, smiling, quite as a matter of course, “Naō tem pai; é filha da\r\nfortúna,”—“She hasn’t any father; she is the daughter of chance.” In the\r\nsame way, when the daughter showed me two children of her own,—little\r\nfair people, many shades lighter than herself,—and I asked whether their\r\nfather was at the war, like all the rest of the men, she gave me the\r\nsame answer, “They haven’t any father.” It is the way the Indian or\r\nhalf-breed women here always speak of their illegitimate children; and\r\nthough they say it without an intonation of sadness or of blame,\r\napparently as unconscious of any wrong or shame as if they said the\r\nfather was absent or dead, it has the most melancholy significance; it\r\nseems to speak of such absolute desertion. So far is this from being an\r\nunusual case, that among the common people the opposite seems the\r\nexception. Children are frequently quite ignorant of their parentage.\r\nThey know about their mother, for all the care and responsibility falls\r\nupon her, but they have no knowledge of their father; nor does it seem\r\nto occur to the woman that she or her children have any claim upon him.\r\n\r\nBut to return to the sitio. The room I have described stood on one side\r\nof a cleared and neatly swept ground, about which, at various distances,\r\nstood a number of little thatched “casinhas,” as they call them,\r\nconsisting mostly of a single room. But beside these there was one\r\nlarger house, with mud walls and floor, containing two or three rooms,\r\nand having a wooden veranda in front. This was the Senhora’s private\r\nestablishment. At a little distance farther down on the hill was the\r\nmandioca kitchen and all the accompanying apparatus. Nothing could be\r\nneater than the whole area of this sitio, and while we were there two or\r\nthree black girls were sent out to sweep it afresh with their stiff\r\ntwig-brooms. Around lay the plantation of mandioca and cacao, with here\r\nand there a few coffee-shrubs. It is difficult to judge of the extent of\r\nthese sitio plantations, because they are so irregular and comprise such\r\na variety of trees,—mandioca, coffee, cacao, and often cotton, being\r\nplanted pellmell together. But this one, like the whole establishment,\r\nseemed larger and better cared for than those usually seen. On the\r\nreturn of the gentlemen from the igarapé we took leave, though very\r\nwarmly pressed to stay and breakfast. At parting, our Indian hostess\r\npresented me with a wicker-basket of fresh eggs and some abacatys, or\r\nalligator pears as we call them.[80] We reached the house just in time\r\nfor a ten o’clock breakfast, which assembled all the different parties\r\nonce more from their various occupations, whether of work or play. The\r\nsportsmen returned from the forest, bringing a goodly supply of toucans,\r\npapagaios, and parroquets, with a variety of other birds, and the\r\nfisherman brought in new treasures for Mr. Agassiz.\r\n\r\n_October 29th._—Yesterday, after breakfast, I retreated to the room\r\nwhere we had passed the night, hoping to find time and quiet for writing\r\nletters and completing my journal. But I found it already occupied by\r\nthe old Senhora and her guests, who were lounging in the hammocks or\r\nsquatting on the floor and smoking their pipes. The house is indeed full\r\nto overflowing, as the whole party assembled for the ball are to stay\r\nduring the President’s visit. But in this way of living it is an easy\r\nmatter to accommodate any number of people, for if they cannot all be\r\nreceived under the roof, they can hang their hammocks under the trees\r\noutside. As I went to my room last evening, I stopped to look at a\r\npretty picture of an Indian mother with her two little children asleep\r\non either arm, all in one hammock, in the open air. My Indian friends\r\nwere too much interested in my occupations to allow of my continuing\r\nthem uninterruptedly. They were delighted with my books (I happened to\r\nhave “The Naturalist on the Amazons” with me, in which I showed them\r\nsome pictures of Amazonian scenery and insects), and asked me many\r\nquestions about my country, my voyage, and my travels here. In return\r\nthey gave me much information about their own way of life. They said the\r\npresent gathering of neighbors and friends was no unusual occurrence,\r\nfor they have a great many festas, which, though partly religious in\r\ncharacter, are also occasions of great festivity. These festas are\r\ncelebrated at different sitios in turn, the saint of the day being\r\ncarried, with all his ornaments, candles, bouquets, &c., to the house\r\nwhere the ceremony is to take place, and where all the people of the\r\nvillage congregate. Sometimes the festa lasts for several days, and is\r\naccompanied with processions, music, and dances in the evening. But the\r\nwomen said the forest was very sad now, because their men had all been\r\ntaken as recruits, or were seeking safety in the woods. The old Senhora\r\ntold me a sad story of the brutality exercised in recruiting the\r\nIndians. She assured me that they were taken wherever found, without\r\nregard to age or circumstances, women and children often being dependent\r\nupon them; and if they made resistance, were carried off by force, and\r\nfrequently handcuffed or had heavy weights attached to their feet. Such\r\nproceedings are entirely illegal; but these forest villages are so\r\nremote, that the men employed to recruit may practice any cruelty\r\nwithout being called to account for it. If the recruits are brought in\r\nin good condition, no questions are asked. These women said that all the\r\nwork of the sitios—the making of farinha, the fishing, the\r\nturtle-hunting—was stopped for want of hands. The appearance of things\r\ncertainly confirms this, for we scarcely see any men in the villages,\r\nand the canoes we meet are mostly rowed by women.\r\n\r\nYet I must say that the life of the Indian woman, so far as we have seen\r\nit, seems enviable, in comparison with that of the Brazilian lady in the\r\nAmazonian towns. The former has a healthful out-of-door life; she has\r\nher canoe on the lake or river and her paths through the forest, with\r\nperfect liberty to come and go; she has her appointed daily occupations,\r\nbeing busy not only with the care of her house and children, but in\r\nmaking farinha or tapioca, or in drying and rolling tobacco, while the\r\nmen are fishing and turtle-hunting; and she has her frequent festa-days\r\nto enliven her working life. It is, on the contrary, impossible to\r\nimagine anything more dreary and monotonous than the life of the\r\nBrazilian Senhora in the smaller towns. In the northern provinces\r\nespecially the old Portuguese notions about shutting women up and making\r\ntheir home-life as colorless as that of a cloistered nun, without even\r\nthe element of religious enthusiasm to give it zest, still prevail. Many\r\na Brazilian lady passes day after day without stirring beyond her four\r\nwalls, scarcely ever showing herself at the door or window; for she is\r\nalways in a slovenly dishabille, unless she expects company. It is sad\r\nto see these stifled existences; without any contact with the world\r\noutside, without any charm of domestic life, without books or culture of\r\nany kind, the Brazilian Senhora in this part of the country either sinks\r\ncontentedly into a vapid, empty, aimless life, or frets against her\r\nchains, and is as discontented as she is useless.\r\n\r\nOn the day of our arrival the dinner was interrupted by the entrance of\r\nthe Indians with their greetings and presents of game to the President;\r\nyesterday it was enlivened by quite a number of appropriate toasts and\r\nspeeches. I thought, as we sat around the dinner-table, there had\r\nprobably never been gathered under the palm-roof of an Indian house on\r\nthe Amazons just such a party before, combining so many different\r\nelements and objects. There was the President, whose chief interest was\r\nof course in administering the affairs of the province, in which the\r\nIndians shared largely his attention; there was the young statesman,\r\nwhose whole heart is in the great national question of peopling the\r\nAmazons and opening it to the world, and the effect this movement is to\r\nhave upon his country; there was the able engineer, much of whose\r\nscientific life has been passed in surveying the great river and its\r\ntributaries with a view to their future navigation; and there was the\r\nman of pure science, come to study the distribution of animal life in\r\ntheir waters, without any view to practical questions. The speeches\r\ntouched upon all these different interests, and were received with\r\nenthusiasm, each one closing with a toast and music; for our little band\r\nof the night before was brought in to enliven the occasion. The\r\nBrazilians are very happy in their after-dinner speeches, expressing\r\nthemselves with great facility, either from a natural gift or because\r\nspeech-making is an art in which they have had much practice. The habit\r\nof drinking healths and giving toasts is very general throughout the\r\ncountry, and the most informal dinner among intimate friends does not\r\nconclude without some mutual greetings of this kind.\r\n\r\nAs we were taking coffee under the trees afterwards, having yielded our\r\nplaces, in the primitive dining-room, to the Indian guests, the\r\nPresident suggested a sunset row on the lake. The hour and the light\r\nwere most tempting, and we were soon off in the canoe, taking no\r\nboatmen, the gentlemen preferring to row themselves. We went through the\r\nsame lovely region, half water, half land, which we had passed in the\r\nmorning, floating between patches of greenest grass, and by large forest\r\ntrees, and blackened trunks standing out of the lake like ruins. We did\r\nnot go very fast nor very far, for our amateur boatmen found the evening\r\nwarm, and their rowing was rather play than work; they stopped, too,\r\nevery now and then, to get a shot at a white heron or to shoot into a\r\nflock of parroquets or ciganas, whereby they wasted a good deal of\r\npowder to no effect. As we turned to come back we were met by one of the\r\nprettiest sights I have ever seen. The Indian women, having finished\r\ntheir dinner, had taken the little two-masted canoe, dressed with flags,\r\nwhich had been prepared for the President’s reception, and had come out\r\nto meet us. They had the music on board and there were two or three men\r\nin the boat; but the women were some twelve or fifteen in number, and\r\nseemed, like genuine Amazons, to have taken things into their own hands.\r\nThey were rowing with a will; and as the canoe drew near, with music\r\nplaying and flags flying, the purple lake, dyed in the sunset and smooth\r\nas a mirror, gave back the picture. Every tawny figure at the oars,\r\nevery flutter of the crimson and blue streamers, every fold of the green\r\nand yellow national flag at the prow, was as distinct below the surface\r\nas above it. The fairy boat—for so it looked—floating between glowing\r\nsky and water, and seeming to borrow color from both, came on apace; and\r\nas it approached, our friends greeted us with many a _Viva_, to which we\r\nresponded as heartily. Then the two canoes joined company and we went on\r\ntogether, the guitar sometimes being taken into one canoe and sometimes\r\ninto the other, while Brazilian and Indian songs followed each other.\r\nAnything more national, more completely imbued with tropical coloring\r\nand character than this evening scene on the lake, can hardly be\r\nconceived. When we reached the landing, the gold and rose-colored clouds\r\nwere fading into soft masses of white and ashen gray, and moonlight was\r\ntaking the place of sunset. As we went up the green slope to the sitio,\r\na dance on the grass was proposed, and the Indian girls formed a\r\nquadrille; for thus much of civilization has crept into their native\r\nmanners, though they throw into it so much of their own characteristic\r\nmovements, that it loses something of its conventional aspect. Then we\r\nreturned to the house, where the dancing and singing were renewed, while\r\nhere and there groups sat about on the ground laughing and talking, the\r\nwomen smoking with as much enjoyment as the men. Smoking is almost\r\nuniversal among the common women here, yet is not confined to the lower\r\nclasses. Many a Senhora (at least in this part of Brazil, for we must\r\ndistinguish between the civilization on the banks of the Amazons and in\r\nthe interior and that in the cities along the coast) enjoys her pipe,\r\nwhile she lounges in her hammock through the heat of the day.\r\n\r\n_October 30th._—Yesterday our party broke up. The Indian women came to\r\nbid us good-by after breakfast, and dispersed to their several homes,\r\ngoing off in various directions through the forest-paths in little\r\ngroups, their babies, of whom there were a goodly number, astride on\r\ntheir hips, as usual, and the older children following. Mr. Agassiz\r\npassed the morning in packing and arranging his fishes, having collected\r\nin those two days more than seventy new species.[81] His studies have\r\nbeen the subject of great curiosity to the people about the sitio; one\r\nor two were always hovering about to look at his work and to watch Mr.\r\nBurkhardt’s drawing. They seemed to think it extraordinary that any one\r\nshould care to take the portrait of a fish. The familiarity of these\r\nchildren of the forest with the natural objects about them—plants,\r\nbirds, insects, fishes, etc.—is remarkable. They frequently ask to see\r\nthe drawings; and in turning over a pile containing several hundred\r\ncolored sketches of fishes, they scarcely make a mistake,—even the\r\nchildren giving the name instantly, and often adding, “É filho d’este,”\r\n(it is the child of such an one,) thus distinguishing the young from the\r\nadult, and pointing out their relation.\r\n\r\nWe dined rather earlier than usual, our chief dish being a stew of\r\nparrots and toucans, and left the sitio at about five o’clock, in three\r\ncanoes, the music accompanying us in the smaller boat. Our Indian\r\nfriends stood on the shore as we left, giving us farewell greetings,\r\nwaving their hats and hands, and cheering heartily. The afternoon row\r\nthrough the lake and igarapé was delicious; but the sun had long set as\r\nwe issued from the little river, and the Rio Negro, where it opens\r\nbroadly out into the Amazons, was a sea of silver. The boat with the\r\nmusic presently joined our canoe, and we had a number of the Brazilian\r\n“modinhas,” as they call them,—songs which seem especially adapted for\r\nthe guitar. These modinhas have a quite peculiar character. They are\r\nlittle graceful, lyrical snatches of song, with a rather melancholy\r\ncadence; even those of which the words are gay not being quite free from\r\nthis undertone of sadness. This put us all into a somewhat dreamy mood,\r\nand we approached the end of our journey rather silently. But as we drew\r\nnear the landing, we heard the sound of a band of brass instruments,\r\neffectually drowning our feeble efforts, and saw a crowded canoe coming\r\ntowards us. They were the boys from the Indian school which we visited\r\non our previous stay at Manaos. The canoe looked very pretty as it came\r\ntowards us in the moonlight; it seemed full to overflowing, the children\r\nall dressed in white uniforms and standing up. This little band comes\r\nalways on Sunday evenings and festa-days to play before the President’s\r\nhouse. They were just going home, it being nearly ten o’clock; but the\r\nPresident called to them to turn back, and they accompanied us to the\r\nbeach, playing all the while. Thus our pleasant three days’ picnic ended\r\nwith music and moonlight.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 77:\r\n\r\n  The most accurate information upon the industrial resources of the\r\n  Valley of the Amazons may be found in a work published by Senhor\r\n  Tavares Bastos, on his return to Rio de Janeiro, after this journey,\r\n  entitled “O Valle do Amazonas—Estudo sobre a livre Navegaçaō do\r\n  Amazonas, Estatistica, Producçöes, Commercio, Questöes Fiscaes do\r\n  Valle do Amazonas.” Rio de Janeiro, 1866.\r\n\r\nFootnote 78:\r\n\r\n  This relation is a much nearer one throughout Brazil than with us.

This week has been rather uneventful.\r\nMr. Agassiz is prevented from undertaking new expeditions by the want of\r\nalcohol. The next steamer will bring a fresh supply from Pará; and\r\nmeanwhile, being interrupted in his collections, he is making a study of\r\nthe various intermixture of races, Indians and Negroes, with their\r\ncrossings, of which a great number are found here. Our picturesque\r\nbarrack of a room, which we have left for more comfortable quarters in\r\nMr. Honorio’s house, serves as a photographic saloon, and here Mr.\r\nAgassiz is at work half the day with his young friend Mr. Hunnewell, who\r\nspent almost the whole time of our stay in Rio in learning photography,\r\nand has become quite expert in taking likenesses. The grand difficulty\r\nis found in the prejudices of the people themselves. There is a\r\nprevalent superstition among the Indians and Negroes that a portrait\r\nabsorbs into itself something of the vitality of the sitter, and that\r\nany one is liable to die shortly after his picture is taken. This notion\r\nis so deeply rooted that it has been no easy matter to overcome it.\r\nHowever, of late the desire to see themselves in a picture is gradually\r\ngaining the ascendant, the example of a few courageous ones having\r\nemboldened the more timid, and models are much more easily obtained now\r\nthan they were at first.\r\n\r\nYesterday our quiet life was interrupted by an excursion to the great\r\ncascade, where we went with a party of friends to breakfast and dine. We\r\nwere called with the dawn, and were on the road at six o’clock, the\r\nservants following laden with baskets of provisions. The dewy walk\r\nthrough the woods in the early morning was very pleasant, and we arrived\r\nat the little house above the cascade before the heat of the day began.\r\nThis house stands on a hill in a cleared ground entirely surrounded by\r\nforest; just below it the river comes rushing through the wood, and\r\nfalls some ten feet over a thin platform of rock. By its formation, this\r\ncascade is a Niagara in miniature; that is, the lower layer of rock\r\nbeing softer than the upper, the water has worn it away until there now\r\nremains only a thin slab of harder rock across the river. Deprived of\r\nits support, this slab must break down eventually, as Table-rock has\r\ndone, when the cascade will, of course, retreat by so much and begin the\r\nsame process a little higher up. It has, no doubt, thus worn its way\r\nupward already from a distant point. The lower deposit is clay, the\r\nupper consists of the constantly recurring reddish sandstone,—in other\r\nwords, drift worked over by water. Below the fall, the water goes\r\ntearing along through a narrow passage, over boulders, fallen trees, and\r\ndecaying logs, which break it into rapids. At a little distance from the\r\ncascade there is a deep, broad basin in the wood, with a sand bottom, so\r\novershadowed by great trees that it looks dark even in tropical midday.\r\nThe bathing here, as we found by experience at a later hour, is most\r\ndelicious. The shade over the pool is so profound and the current runs\r\nthrough it so swiftly that the water is exceedingly cold,—an unusual\r\nthing here,—and it seems very refreshing to those coming from the hot\r\nsun outside. At the side of this pool I saw a very large parasitic plant\r\nin flower. Since we have been on the Amazons most of these parasites\r\nhave been out of bloom, and, though we have seen beautiful collections\r\nin private gardens, we have not met them in the woods. This one was\r\ngrowing in the lofty notch of a great tree, overhanging the water; a\r\ntuft of dark green leaves with large violet and straw-colored blossoms\r\namong them. It was quite out of reach, and the little garden looked so\r\npretty in its airy perch, that I was almost glad we had no power to\r\ndisturb it. After breakfast some of the guests, and Mr. Agassiz among\r\nthem, were obliged to return to town on business. They rejoined us in\r\ntime for a late dinner, arriving in a canoe instead of coming on foot,\r\nan experiment which we had been prevented from trying in the morning,\r\nbecause we had been told that, as the igarapé was low and the bottom\r\nvery rocky, it would be impossible to ascend the whole distance in a\r\nboat. They came, however, in perfect safety, and were delighted with the\r\npicturesque beauty of the row. After a very cheerful dinner, closing\r\nwith a cup of coffee in the open air, we started at twilight for town,\r\nby different roads. Desirous to see the lower course of the igarapé,\r\nwhich Mr. Agassiz reported as so beautiful, and being assured that there\r\nwas no real danger, I returned in the little canoe with Mr. Honorio. It\r\nwas thought best not to overload it, so the others took the forest road\r\nby which we had come in the morning. I must say that as I went down the\r\nrough steps to the landing, in the very pool where we had bathed, it\r\nstruck me that the undertaking was somewhat perilous; if this\r\novershadowed nook was dark at noonday, it was black at nightfall, and\r\nthe turbulent little stream, rushing along over rocks and logs, looked\r\nmischievous. The rest of the party went with us to the embarkation, and,\r\nas we disappeared in the darkness under the overhanging branches, one of\r\nthem called after us, laughingly,\r\n\r\n               “Lasciate ogni speranza, voi che ’ntrate.”\r\n\r\nHowever, there was only danger enough to laugh at, none to give real\r\nconcern, and I enjoyed the row through the narrow channel, where the\r\ntrees met overhead, and where the boatmen were obliged to jump into the\r\nwater to guide the canoe among the boulders and fallen trunks. We\r\nreached home in perfect safety, and in time to welcome the others when\r\nthey arrived on foot.\r\n\r\n_November 8th._—Manaos has been in unwonted agitation, for the last few\r\ndays, on the subject of a public ball to be given in honor of Mr.\r\nTavares Bastos. Where it should take place, what should be the day and\r\nhour, and, among the Senhoras, what one should wear, have been the\r\nsubjects of discussion. The doubtful questions were at last settled, and\r\nit was appointed for the fifth of the month, in the President’s palace.\r\n“Palace” is the name always given to the residence of the President of\r\nthe province, however little the house may be in keeping with the title.\r\nThe night was not so auspicious as could have been wished; it was very\r\ndark, and, as no such luxury as a carriage is known here, the different\r\nparties might be seen groping through the streets at the appointed hour,\r\nlighted with lanterns. Every now and then, as we were on our way, a\r\nball-dress would emerge from the darkness of an opposite corner, picking\r\nits way with great care along the muddy ruts. When we had all assembled,\r\nhowever, I did not see that any toilet had suffered seriously on the\r\nroad. The dresses were of every variety, from silks and satins to stuff\r\ngowns, and the complexions of all tints, from the genuine negro through\r\npaler shades of Indian and negro to white. There is absolutely no\r\ndistinction of color here; a black lady, always supposing her to be\r\nfree, is treated with as much consideration and meets with as much\r\nattention as a white one. It is, however, rare to see a person in\r\nsociety who can be called a genuine negro; but there are many mulattoes\r\nand mamelucos, that is, persons having black or Indian blood. There is\r\nlittle ease in Brazilian society, even in the larger cities; still less\r\nin the smaller ones, where, to guard against mistakes, the\r\nconventionalities of town life are exaggerated. The Brazilians, indeed,\r\nthough so kind and hospitable, are a formal people, fond of etiquette\r\nand social solemnities. On their arrival, all the Senhoras were placed\r\nin stiff rows around the walls of the dancing-room. Occasionally an\r\nunfortunate cavalier would stray in and address a few words to this\r\nformidable array of feminine charms; but it was not until the close of\r\nthe evening, when the dancing had broken up the company into groups,\r\nthat the scene became really gay. At intervals, trays of “doces” and tea\r\nwere handed round, and at twelve there was a more solid repast, at which\r\nall the ladies were seated, their partners standing behind their chairs\r\nand waiting upon them. Then began the toasts and healths, which were\r\ngiven and received with great enthusiasm. After supper the dancing was\r\nrenewed and continued till after midnight, when the steamer from Pará\r\nwas seen coming into port, throwing up rockets and burning blue-lights\r\nas she advanced, to announce that she was the bearer of good tidings\r\nfrom the war. This, of course, gave general satisfaction, and the ball\r\nbroke up in great hilarity. There were some who did not sleep at all\r\nthat night, for many of the gentlemen went from the ball-room to the\r\nsteamer in search of the papers, which brought the news of a decided\r\nvictory over the Paraguayans, at Uruguayana, where the Emperor commanded\r\nin person. It is said that seven thousand prisoners were taken. The next\r\nnight the ball was renewed in honor of this victory; so that Manaos,\r\nwhose inhabitants complain of the life as very dull, has had a most\r\nunwonted rush of gayety this week.\r\n\r\n_November 9th._—The severity in recruiting, of which we heard so much at\r\nthe Lake of Hyanuary, is beginning to bear its fruits in general\r\ndiscontent. Some of the recruits have made their escape, and, on Tuesday\r\nand Wednesday, before the steamer in which they were to go down to Pará\r\nsailed, the disturbance was so great among them that they were kept\r\nunder lock and key. The impression seems to be general here that the\r\nprovince of the Amazonas has been called upon to bear more than its\r\nshare of the burden, and that the defencelessness of the Indians in the\r\nscattered settlements has made them especially victims. As there was no\r\nother armed force here, several of the crew of the “Ibicuhy” were taken\r\nto go down to Pará as guard over the unruly troops. Partly in\r\nconsequence of this, we have resolved to remain at Manaos till the end\r\nof the month; a delay which Mr. Agassiz does not regret, as it enables\r\nhim to continue the comparison of the races which he has begun, and for\r\nwhich the circumstances here are unusually favorable. In the mean time\r\nthe President has provided him with canoes and men for three separate\r\nexpeditions, on which he sends off three parties this week: Mr. Talisman\r\nand Mr. Dexter to the Rio Negro and Rio Branco, to be absent six weeks;\r\nMr. Thayer and Mr. Bourget to Lake Cudajas, to be gone ten days; Mr.\r\nJames to Manacapuru, for about the same time. We feel the generosity of\r\nthis conduct the more, knowing how greatly the administration stands in\r\nneed of men and of all the resources at its command in the present\r\ndisturbed state of things.\r\n\r\n_November 18th._—One can hardly walk in any direction out of the town\r\nwithout meeting something characteristic of the people and their ways of\r\nliving. At seven o’clock, to-day, I took my morning walk through the\r\nwood near the house to an igarapé, which is the scene of much of the\r\nout-of-doors life here,—fishing, washing, bathing, turtle-shooting. As I\r\nreturned along the little path leading by the side of the stream, two\r\nnaked Indian boys were shooting fish with bow and arrows from a fallen\r\ntree which jutted out into the stream. Like bronze statues they looked,\r\nas they stood quiet and watchful, in attitudes full of grace and\r\nstrength, their bows drawn ready to let the arrow fly the moment they\r\nshould catch sight of the fish. The Indian boys are wonderfully skilful\r\nin this sport, and also in shooting arrows through long blow-pipes\r\n(Sarabatanas) to kill birds. This is no bad way of shooting, for the\r\nreport of the gun startles the game so effectually in these thick\r\nforests, that after a few shots the sportsman finds the woods in his\r\nimmediate neighborhood deserted; whereas the Indian boy creeps\r\nstealthily up to the spot from which he takes aim and discharges his\r\nnoiseless arrow with such precision, that the bird or monkey drops down\r\nfrom among its companions, without their perceiving the cause of its\r\ndisappearance. While I was watching the boys, a canoe came up the\r\nstream, paddled by women, and loaded with fruit and vegetables, on the\r\ntop of which sat two bright green parrots. Two of the women were old and\r\nhideous, very wrinkled and withered, as these people usually are in old\r\nage; but the third was the handsomest Indian woman I have ever seen,\r\nwith a tinge of white blood to be sure, for her skin was fairer and her\r\nfeatures more regular than those of the Indians generally. They were\r\ncoming from their sitio, as I learned afterwards. When they had moored\r\ntheir boat to a tree, the younger woman began to unload, tucking her\r\npetticoat about her hips, and wading to and fro with baskets of fruit\r\nand vegetables on her head. Her hair was dressed with flowers, as is\r\nusual with these women; however scanty their clothing, they seldom\r\nforget this ornament.\r\n\r\n_November 20th._—The President, Dr. Epaminondas, added yesterday to the\r\nmany kindnesses by which he has rendered our stay here doubly pleasant,\r\nin giving an exceedingly pretty fête in honor of Mr. Agassiz. The place\r\nchosen was the asylum for Indian children already described, well\r\nadapted for the purpose on account of its large, airy rooms and\r\nbeautiful situation; and the invitation was given out in the name of the\r\n“Province of the Amazonas.”[82] The day was most propitious; a rain\r\nduring the night had cooled the air, and a slightly overcast sky,\r\ncombined with the freshness of the atmosphere, gave just the conditions\r\nmost desirable for any such excursion in this climate. When we reached\r\nthe beach from which we were to leave, people were beginning to\r\nassemble, and a number of canoes were already on their way, looking very\r\ngay with their white awnings above and the bright dresses inside. Twenty\r\nminutes’ row brought us to our destination. The scene was very pretty;\r\nthe path from the landing to the main house was lined with flags and\r\nwith palm-trees brought from the forest for the occasion, and the open\r\nsides of the large rooms outside, usually working-rooms, but now fitted\r\nup for the breakfast, were all filled in with green arches built of\r\ntrees and flowers, so that the whole space was transformed, for the time\r\nbeing, into an arbor. We were received with music and conducted to the\r\nmain building, where all the guests gradually assembled, some two\r\nhundred in number. At about one o’clock the President led the way to the\r\ngreen arcades which, as yet, we had seen only from a distance. Nothing\r\ncould be more tasteful than the arrangements. The tables were placed\r\naround a hollow square, in the centre of which was the American flag,\r\nwith the Brazilian on either side of it; while a number of other flags\r\ndraped the room and made the whole scene bright with color. The\r\nlandscape, framed in the open green arches, made so many pictures,\r\npretty glimpses of water and wood, with here and there a palm-thatched\r\nroof among the trees on the opposite side of the river. A fresh breeze\r\nblew through the open dining-room, stirring the folds of the flags, and\r\nmaking a pleasant rustle in the trees, which added their music to that\r\nof the band outside. Since we are on the Amazons, a thousand miles from\r\nits mouth, it is worth while to say a word of the breakfast itself.\r\nThere is such an exaggerated idea of the hardships and difficulty of a\r\nvoyage on the Amazons, (at least so I infer from many remarks made to\r\nus, not only at home, but even in Rio de Janeiro by Brazilians\r\nthemselves, when we were on the eve of departure for this journey,) that\r\nit will hardly be believed that a public breakfast, given in Manaos,\r\nshould have all the comforts, and almost all the luxuries, of a similar\r\nentertainment in any other part of the world. It is true, that we had\r\nneither ices nor champagne, the former being of course difficult to\r\nobtain in this climate; but these two exceptions were more than\r\ncompensated for by the presence of tropical fruits not to be had\r\nelsewhere at any price,—enormous Pineapples, green and purple Abacatys\r\n(alligator pears), crimson Pitangas, Attas (fruta do Conde), Abios,\r\nSapotis, Bananas of the choicest kinds and in the greatest profusion,\r\nand a variety of Maracujas (the fruit of the passion-flower).[83] The\r\nbreakfast was gay, the toasts were numerous, the speeches animated, and\r\nlong after the Senhoras had left the table the room still echoed with\r\nVivas, as health followed health. At the close of the dinner there was a\r\nlittle scene which struck us as very pretty; I do not know whether it is\r\na custom here, but, as it excited no remark, I suppose it may be. When\r\nthe gentlemen returned to the house, bringing the music with them, all\r\nthe waiters assembled in line before the door, decanter and glass in\r\nhand, to finish the remains of the wine with a toast on their own\r\naccount. The head-waiter then stood in front of them and gave the\r\nhealth, first, of the persons for whom the banquet was given, followed\r\nby that of the President, all of which were answered with Vivas as they\r\nfilled their glasses. Then one of the gentlemen stepping forward gave,\r\namid shouts of laughter, the health of the head-waiter himself, which\r\nwas drank in a closing bumper with perhaps more animation than either of\r\nthe others. The afternoon closed with dancing, and at sunset the canoes\r\nassembled and we returned to the city, all feeling, I believe, that the\r\nfestival had been a very happy one. It certainly was so for those to\r\nwhom it was intended to give pleasure, and could hardly fail to be\r\nlikewise for those who had planned and executed it. It will seem strange\r\nto many of my readers that Sunday should be chosen for such a fête; but\r\nhere, as in many parts of continental Europe, even in Protestant\r\ndistricts, Sunday is a holiday and kept as such.\r\n\r\n_November 27th._—Yesterday I visited the prison where the wife of the\r\nchief of police had invited me to see some of the carved articles, straw\r\nwork, &c., made by the prisoners. I had expected to be pained, because I\r\nthought, from the retrograde character of things in general here, the\r\nprison system would be bad. But the climate in these hot countries\r\nregulates the prison life in some degree. Men cannot be shut up in\r\nclose, dark cells, without endangering not only their own lives, but the\r\nsanitary condition of the establishment also. Therefore the prison is\r\nlight and airy, with plenty of doors and windows, secured by bars, but\r\nnot otherwise closed. I infer, however, from a passage on the prisons of\r\nthe province, contained in one of the able reports of President Adolfo\r\nde Barros (1864), that within the last year there has been a great\r\nimprovement, at least in the prison of Manaos. He says: “The state of\r\nthe prisons exceeds all that can be said to their disadvantage. Not only\r\nis it true that there is not to be found throughout the province a\r\nprison which fulfils the conditions imposed by the law, but there is not\r\none which deserves the name of prison with the exception of that in the\r\ncapital. And even this one, while it does not possess one of the\r\nconditions exacted by similar institutions, contains so disproportionate\r\na number of prisoners of all classes, so indiscriminately mingled, that,\r\nsetting aside the other difficulties arising from this association, it\r\nis only by the mercy of Providence that the jail has not been converted\r\ninto a focus of epidemics during the great heat prevailing in this city\r\nfor a great part of the year. In four small rooms, insufficiently\r\nventilated and lighted, are assembled forty prisoners (including the\r\nsick) of various classes and conditions. Without air, without\r\ncleanliness, almost without room to move in their smothered and damp\r\nenclosure, these unhappy beings, against all precepts of law and\r\nhumanity, suffer far more than the simple and salutary rigor of\r\npunishment.” These strictures must have led to a great amendment, for\r\nthe prison does not now appear to be deficient in light or in\r\nventilation, and there is a hospital provided apart for the sick. Some\r\nof the prisoners, especially those who were there for political\r\noffences, having been concerned in a recent revolt at Serpa, were very\r\nheavily ironed; but, excepting this, there were no signs, visible at\r\nleast to the transient observer, of cruelty or neglect. After some\r\nremarks on the best modes of reforming these abuses and the means to be\r\nemployed for that object, Dr. Adolfo goes on to speak of the ruinous\r\ncondition of the prisons in other cities of the province. “Such is the\r\nstate of the prison in the town of Teffé. The edifice in which it is\r\nestablished is an old and crumbling house, belonging to the\r\nmunicipality, thatched with straw, and so ruinous, that it seemed to me,\r\nwhen I visited it, rather like a deserted habitation than like a\r\nbuilding destined for the detention of criminals. There were but a few\r\nprisoners, some of whom were already condemned. I formed a favorable\r\njudgment of them all, for it seemed to me they must have either great\r\nconfidence in their own innocence, or scruples as to compromising the\r\nfew soldiers who acted as guards. In no other way could I explain the\r\nfact that they remained in prison, when flight seemed so easy.” I well\r\nremember one evening when walking in Teffé seeing a number of men\r\nleaning against the wooden grating of a dimly lighted room in a ruinous\r\nthatched house, and being told that this was the prison. I asked myself\r\nthe same question which presented itself to the President’s mind,—why\r\nthese wild-looking, half-naked creatures had not long ago made their\r\nescape from a prison whose bars and bolts would hardly have imposed\r\nrestraint upon a child. The report continues: “A more decent and, above\r\nall, a more secure prison at this point, the most important in the whole\r\nSolimoens, is an urgent and even indispensable necessity. Of the sixteen\r\nprisons in the whole province, only two, that of the capital and of\r\nBarcellos, have their own buildings. With these exceptions, the\r\nprisoners occupy either a part of the houses of the legislative\r\nchambers, or are placed in private houses hired for the purpose, or in\r\nthe quarters of the military detachments. In these different prisons 538\r\nprisoners were received during the current year, inclusive of recruits\r\nand deserters.” This last clause, “inclusive of recruits and deserters,”\r\nand the association of the two classes of men together, as if equally\r\ndelinquent, touches upon a point hardly to be overlooked by the most\r\nsuperficial observer, and which makes a very painful impression on\r\nstrangers. The system of recruiting, or rather the utter want of system,\r\nleads to the most terrible abuse of authority in raising men for the\r\narmy. I believe that the law provides for a constitutional draft levied\r\nequally on all classes, excluding men below or above a certain age, or\r\nhaving certain responsibilities at home. But if such a law exists it is\r\ncertainly not enforced; recruiting parties, as bad as the old\r\n“press-gangs” of England, go out into the forest and seize the Indians\r\nwherever they can find them. All who resist this summary treatment or\r\nshow any inclination to escape are put into prison till the steamer\r\nleaves, by which they are despatched to Pará and thence to the army. The\r\nonly overcrowded room I saw at the prison was that where the recruits\r\nwere confined. Coming from a country where the soldier is honored, where\r\nmen of birth and education have shown that they are not ashamed to serve\r\nin the line if necessary, it seemed to me strange and sad to see these\r\nmen herded with common criminals. The record of the province of the\r\nAmazonas will read well in the history of the present war, for the\r\nnumber of troops contributed is very large in proportion to the\r\npopulation. But as most of them are obtained in this way, it may be\r\ndoubted whether the result is a very strong evidence of patriotism. The\r\nabuses mentioned above are not, however, confined to these remote\r\nregions.[84] It is not uncommon, even in the more populous and central\r\nparts of Brazil, to meet recruits on the road, so-called volunteers,\r\nchained two and two by the neck like criminals, under an armed guard.\r\nWhen we first met a squad of men under these circumstances, on the Juiz\r\nde Fora road, we supposed them to be deserters, but the Brazilians who\r\nwere with us, and who seemed deeply mortified at the circumstance, said\r\nthat they were no doubt ordinary recruits, arrested without inquiry on\r\nthe one side, or power of resistance on the other. They asserted that\r\nthis mode of recruiting was illegal, but that their chains would be\r\ntaken off before entering the city, and no questions asked. A Brazilian\r\ntold me that he had known an instance in which a personal pique against\r\nan enemy had been gratified by pointing out its object to the recruiting\r\nofficer, who had the man at once enlisted, though a large family was\r\nentirely dependent upon him. Our informant seemed to know no redress for\r\ntyranny like this.\r\n\r\nThe hospitality we have received in Brazil, the sympathy shown to Mr.\r\nAgassiz in his scientific undertakings, as well as our own sentiments of\r\ngratitude and affection for our many friends here, forbid us to enter\r\ninto any criticism of Brazilian manners or habits which could have a\r\npersonal application. Neither do I believe that a few months’ residence\r\nin a country entitles any one to a judgment upon the national character\r\nof its people. Yet there are certain features of Brazilian institutions\r\nand politics which cannot but strike a stranger unfavorably, and which\r\nexplain the complaints one constantly hears from foreign residents. The\r\nexceedingly liberal constitution, borrowed in great part from our own,\r\nprepares one to expect the largest practical liberty. To a degree this\r\nexists; there is no censorship of the press; there is no constraint upon\r\nthe exercise of any man’s religion; nominally, there is absolute freedom\r\nof thought and belief. But in the practical working of the laws there is\r\na very arbitrary element, and a petty tyranny of the police against\r\nwhich there seems to be no appeal. There is, in short, an utter want of\r\nharmony between the institutions and the actual condition of the people.\r\nMay it not be, that a borrowed constitution, in no way the growth of the\r\nsoil, is, after all, like an ill-fitting garment, not made for the\r\nwearer, and hanging loosely upon him? There can be no organic relation\r\nbetween a truly liberal form of government and a people for whom, taking\r\nthem as a whole, little or no education is provided, whose religion is\r\nadministered by a corrupt clergy, and who, whether white or black, are\r\nbrought up under the influence of slavery. Liberty will not abide in the\r\nlaws alone; it must have its life in the desire of the nation, its\r\nstrength in her resolve to have and to hold it. Another feature which\r\nmakes a painful impression on the stranger is the enfeebled character of\r\nthe population. I have spoken of this before, but in the northern\r\nprovinces it is more evident than farther south. It is not merely that\r\nthe children are of every hue; the variety of color in every society\r\nwhere slavery prevails tells the same story of amalgamation of race; but\r\nhere this mixture of races seems to have had a much more unfavorable\r\ninfluence on the physical development than in the United States. It is\r\nas if all clearness of type had been blurred, and the result is a vague\r\ncompound lacking character and expression. This hybrid class, although\r\nmore marked here because the Indian element is added, is very numerous\r\nin all the cities and on the large plantations; perhaps the fact, so\r\nhonorable to Brazil, that the free negro has full access to all the\r\nprivileges of any free citizen, rather tends to increase than diminish\r\nthe number.[85]\r\n\r\n_December 3d._—Yesterday was the Emperor’s birthday, always kept as a\r\nholiday throughout Brazil, and this year with more enthusiasm than\r\nusual, because he has just returned from the army, and has made himself\r\ndoubly dear to his people, not only by the success which attended his\r\npresence there, but by his humanity toward the soldiers. We had our\r\nilluminations, bouquets, music, &c., as well as the rest of the world;\r\nbut as Manaos is not overflowing with wealth, the candles were rather\r\nfew, and there were long lapses of darkness alternating with the\r\noccasional brilliancy. We went out in the evening to make a few calls,\r\nand listen to the music in the open ground dignified by the name of the\r\npublic square. Here all the surrounding buildings were brightly\r\nilluminated; there was a very pretty tent in the centre, where the band\r\nof Indian children from the Casa dos Educandos was playing; preparations\r\nwere making for the ascension of a lighted balloon at a later hour, and\r\nso on. But whenever we have been present at public festivities in\r\nBrazil,—and our observation is confirmed by other foreigners,—we have\r\nbeen struck with the want of gayety, the absence of merriment. There is\r\na kind of lack-lustre character in their fêtes, so far as any\r\ndemonstration of enjoyment is concerned. Perhaps it is owing to their\r\nenervating climate, but the Brazilians do not seem to work or play with\r\na will. They have not the activity which, while it makes life a restless\r\nfever with our people, gives it interest also; neither have they the\r\nlove of amusement of the continental Europeans.\r\n\r\n_December 6th._—Manaos. Mr. Thayer returned to-day from Lake Alexo,\r\nbringing a valuable collection of fish, obtained with some difficulty on\r\naccount of the height of water; it is rapidly rising now, and the fish\r\nare in consequence daily scattered over a wider space. This addition\r\nwith the collections brought in by Mr. Bourget and Mr. Thayer from\r\nCudajas, by Mr. James from Manacapuru, and by Major Coutinho from Lake\r\nHyanuary, José-Fernandez, Curupira, &c., &c., brings the number of\r\nAmazonian species up to something over thirteen hundred. Mr. Agassiz\r\nstill carries out his plan of dispersing his working force in such a\r\nmanner as to determine the limits of the distribution of species; to\r\nascertain, for instance, whether those which are in the Amazons at one\r\nseason may be in the Solimoens at another or at the same time, and also\r\nwhether those which are found about Manaos extend higher up in the Rio\r\nNegro. For this reason, as we have seen, while at Teffé himself he kept\r\nparties above in various localities,—at Tabatinga and on the rivers Iça\r\nand Hyutahy; and now, while he and some of his assistants are collecting\r\nin the immediate neighborhood of Manaos, Mr. Dexter and Mr. Talisman are\r\non the Rio Negro and Rio Branco. Following the same plan in descending\r\nthe river, he intends to establish one station at Serpa, another at\r\nObydos, another at Santarem, while he will go himself to the river\r\nMauhes, which connects the Amazons with the Madeira.\r\n\r\n_December 10th._—To-day Mr. Dexter and Mr. Talisman returned from their\r\ncanoe excursion to the Rio Branco. They are rather disappointed in the\r\nresult of their expedition, having found the state of the waters most\r\nextraordinary for the season and very unfavorable for their purpose. The\r\nRio Negro was so full that the beaches had entirely disappeared, and it\r\nwas impossible to draw the nets; while on the Rio Branco the people\r\nstated that the water had not fallen during the whole year,—an\r\nunheard-of phenomenon, and unfortunate for the inhabitants, who were\r\ndreading famine for want of their usual supply of dried and salted fish,\r\non which they so largely depend for food. This provision is always made\r\nwhen the waters are lowest, and when the large fish, driven into\r\nshallower and narrower basins, are easily caught. Though their\r\ncollection of fish is therefore small, including only twenty-eight new\r\nspecies, Mr. Dexter and Mr. Talisman bring several monkeys, a very large\r\nalligator, some beautiful birds, among them the blue Mackaw, and a\r\nnumber of very fine palms. To-morrow we leave Manaos in the Ibicuhy, on\r\nan excursion to the little town of Mauhes, where we are to pass a week\r\nor ten days. Though we return for a day or two on our way to the Rio\r\nNegro, yet we feel that our permanent stay in Manaos is over. The six\r\nweeks we have passed here have been very valuable in scientific results.\r\nNot only has Mr. Agassiz largely increased his knowledge of the fishes,\r\nbut he has had an opportunity of accumulating a mass of new and\r\ninteresting information on the many varieties of the colored races,\r\nproduced by the crossing of Indians, negroes, and whites, which he has\r\nrecorded not only in notes, but in a very complete series of\r\nphotographs. Perhaps nowhere in the world can the blending of types\r\namong men be studied so fully as in the Amazons, where mamelucos,\r\ncafuzos, mulattoes, cabocos, negroes, and whites are mingled in a\r\nconfusion that seems at first inextricable. I insert below a few\r\nextracts from his notes on this subject, which he purposes to treat more\r\nin detail, should he find time hereafter to work up the abundant\r\nmaterial he has collected.\r\n\r\n“However naturalists may differ respecting the origin of species, there\r\nis at least one point on which they agree, namely, that the offspring\r\nfrom two so-called different species is a being intermediate between\r\nthem, sharing the peculiar features of both parents, but resembling\r\nneither so closely as to be mistaken for a pure representative of the\r\none or the other. I hold this fact to be of the utmost importance in\r\nestimating the value and meaning of the differences observed between the\r\nso-called human races. I leave aside the question of their probable\r\norigin, and even that of their number; for my purpose, it does not\r\nmatter whether there are three, four, five, or twenty human races, and\r\nwhether they originated independently from one another or not. The fact\r\nthat they differ by constant permanent features is in itself sufficient\r\nto justify a comparison between the human races and animal species. We\r\nknow that, among animals, when two individuals of different sex and\r\nbelonging to distinct species produce an offspring, the latter does not\r\nclosely resemble either parent, but shares the characteristics of both;\r\nand it seems to me of the highest significance that this fact is equally\r\ntrue of any two individuals of different sexes, belonging to different\r\nhuman races. The child born of negro and white parents is neither black\r\nnor white, but a mulatto; the child born of white and Indian parents is\r\nneither white nor Indian, but a mameluco; the child born of negro and\r\nIndian parents is neither a negro nor an Indian, but a cafuzo; and the\r\ncafuzo, mameluco, and mulatto share the peculiarities of both parents,\r\njust as the mule shares the characteristics of the horse and ass. With\r\nreference to their offspring, the races of men stand, then, to one\r\nanother in the same relation as different species among animals; and the\r\nword _races_, in its present significance, needs only to be retained\r\ntill the number of human species is definitely ascertained and their\r\ntrue characteristics fully understood. I am satisfied that, unless it\r\ncan be shown that the differences between the Indian, negro and white\r\nraces are unstable and transient, it is not in keeping with the facts to\r\naffirm a community of origin for all the varieties of the human family,\r\nnor in keeping with scientific principles to make a difference between\r\nhuman races and animal species in a systematic point of view. In these\r\nvarious forms of humanity there is as much system as in anything else in\r\nnature, and by overlooking the thoughtful combinations expressed in them\r\nwe place ourselves at once outside of the focus from which the whole may\r\nbe correctly seen. In consequence of their constancy, these differences\r\nare so many limitations to prevent a complete melting of normal types\r\ninto each other and consequent loss of their primitive features. That\r\nthese different types are genetically foreign to one another, and do not\r\nrun together by imperceptible, intermediate degrees, appears plain when\r\ntheir mixtures are compared. White and negro produce mulattoes, white\r\nand Indian produce mamelucos, negro and Indian produce cafuzos, and\r\nthese three kinds of half-breeds are not connecting links between the\r\npure races, but stand exactly in that relation to them in which all\r\nhybrids stand to their parents. The mameluco is as truly a half-breed\r\nbetween white and Indian, the cafuzo as truly a half-breed between negro\r\nand Indian, as is the mulatto, commonly so called, a half-breed between\r\nwhite and negro. They all share equally the peculiarities of both\r\nparents, and though more fertile than half-breeds in other families of\r\nthe animal kingdom, there is in all a constant tendency to revert to the\r\nprimary types in a country where three distinct races are constantly\r\ncommingling, for they mix much more readily with the original stocks\r\nthan with each other.[86] Children between mameluco and mameluco, or\r\nbetween cafuzo and cafuzo, or between mulatto and mulatto, are seldom\r\nmet with where the pure races occur; while offspring of mulattoes with\r\nwhites, Indians and negroes, or of mamelucos with whites, Indians, and\r\nnegroes, or of cafuzos with whites, Indians, and negroes, form the bulk\r\nof these mixed populations. The natural result of an uninterrupted\r\ncontact of half-breeds with one another is a class of men in which pure\r\ntype fades away as completely as do all the good qualities, physical and\r\nmoral, of the primitive races, engendering a mongrel crowd as repulsive\r\nas the mongrel dogs, which are apt to be their companions, and among\r\nwhich it is impossible to pick out a single specimen retaining the\r\nintelligence, the nobility, or the affectionateness of nature which\r\nmakes the dog of pure type the favorite companion of civilized man. The\r\nquestion respecting the relation of the human races to each other is\r\ncomplicated by the want of precision in the definition of species.\r\nNaturalists differ greatly in their estimation of the characters by\r\nwhich species are to be distinguished, and of their natural limitations.\r\nI have published elsewhere my own views on this subject. I believe the\r\nboundaries of species to be precise and unvarying, based upon a category\r\nof characters quite distinct from those on which the other groups of the\r\nanimal kingdom, as genera, families, orders, and classes, are founded.\r\nThis category of characters consists chiefly in the relation of\r\nindividuals to one another and to their surroundings, and in the\r\nrelative dimensions and proportions of parts. These characters are no\r\nless permanent and constant in the different species of the human family\r\nthan in those of any other family in the animal kingdom, and my\r\nobservations upon the cross-breeds in South America have convinced me\r\nthat the varieties arising from contact between these human species, or\r\nso-called races, differ from true species just as cross-breeds among\r\nanimals differ from true species, and that they retain the same\r\nliability to revert to the original stock as is observed among all\r\nso-called varieties or breeds.”\r\n\r\nOur visit to Mauhes will be the pleasanter and doubtless the more\r\nsuccessful, because Dr. Epaminondas, who has already done so much to\r\nfacilitate the objects of the expedition, takes this opportunity of\r\nvisiting a region with which, as President of the province, he is\r\ndesirous of becoming acquainted. He is accompanied by our host, Mr.\r\nHonorio, whose house has been such a pleasant home for us during our\r\nstay in Manaos, and also by Mr. Michelis, Lieutenant-Colonel of the\r\nNational Guard of Mauhes, returning to his home there, after a stay of\r\nseveral weeks in Manaos. Besides these, our party consists of Major\r\nCoutinho, Mr. Burkhardt, and ourselves. The position of Mauhes, on the\r\nsouthern side of the Amazons, and its proximity to Manaos and Serpa, may\r\nmake this excursion especially instructive, with reference to the study\r\nof the geographical distribution of the Fishes in the great network of\r\nrivers connecting the Rio Madeira and the Rio Tapajoz with the Amazons.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 82:\r\n\r\n  I trust that the motive will not be misunderstood which induces me to\r\n  add here a translation of the general cards of invitation distributed\r\n  on this occasion. The graceful expression of a thought so kind, and\r\n  the manner in which the President merges his own personality in the\r\n  name of the Province of which he is the administrative head, are so\r\n  characteristic of his mingled courtesy and modesty, that I am tempted\r\n  to insert the note, notwithstanding its personal character.\r\n  Unfortunately, I cannot always do full justice to the kindness shown\r\n  Mr. Agassiz throughout our journey, or to the general appreciation of\r\n  his scientific objects, without introducing testimonials into this\r\n  narrative which it would perhaps be more becoming in me to suppress.\r\n  But I do not know how otherwise to acknowledge our obligations, and I\r\n  trust it will be attributed, by candid readers, to the true motive,—to\r\n  gratitude and not to egotism.\r\n\r\n  “The scientific labors undertaken at this time by the learned and\r\n  illustrious Professor Agassiz in this Province, merit from the\r\n  Amazonenses the most sincere gratitude and acknowledgment, and elicit\r\n  on our part a manifestation by which we seek to show due appreciation\r\n  of his high intellectual merit. I wish that for this object I could\r\n  dispose of more abundant resources, or that the Province had in\r\n  readiness better means of showing the veneration and cordial esteem we\r\n  all bear to him, the respect and admiration we feel for his scientific\r\n  explorations. But the uncertainty of his stay among us obliges me to\r\n  offer at once some proof, however insignificant, of our profound\r\n  esteem for this most deserving American.\r\n\r\n  “To this end, the accomplishment of which I cannot longer defer, I\r\n  invite all to join me in offering to Professor Agassiz and to his\r\n  wife, in the name of the Province of the Amazonas, a modest rural\r\n  breakfast (_almoço campestre_) in the Casa dos Educandos, on Sunday,\r\n  the 18th of this month, at 11 o’clock in the morning. I hereby invite\r\n  you and your family to be present, in order that this festival, great\r\n  in the earnestness of our intentions, however small as compared with\r\n  the importance of those to whom it is offered, should be gay and\r\n  brilliant.\r\n\r\n                                          “ANTONIO EPAMINONDAS DE MELLO.\r\n\r\n  “_Palace of the Government at Manaos, 13 November, 1865._”\r\n\r\nFootnote 83:\r\n\r\n  As I do not wish to mislead, and this narrative may perhaps influence\r\n  some one to make a journey in this region, I should add, that, while\r\n  the above is strictly true, there are many things essential to the\r\n  comfort of the traveller not to be had. There is not a decent hotel\r\n  throughout the whole length of the Amazons, and any one who thinks of\r\n  travelling there must provide himself with such letters as will secure\r\n  accommodation in private houses. So recommended, he may safely depend\r\n  upon hospitality, or upon such assistance from individuals as will\r\n  enable him to find a private lodging.\r\n\r\nFootnote 84:\r\n\r\n  Much of what follows upon social abuses, tyranny of the local police,\r\n  prison discipline, &c., though not quoted in his own words, has been\r\n  gathered from conversations with Mr. Agassiz, or from discussions\r\n  between him and his Brazilian friends. The way in which this volume\r\n  has grown up, being as it were the result of a double experience,\r\n  makes it occasionally difficult to draw the exact line marking the\r\n  boundaries of authorship; the division being indeed somewhat vague in\r\n  the minds of the writers themselves. But since criticisms of this sort\r\n  would have little value, except as based upon larger opportunities for\r\n  observation than fell to my share, I am the more anxious to refer\r\n  them, wherever I can, to their right source.\r\n\r\nFootnote 85:\r\n\r\n  Let any one who doubts the evil of this mixture of races, and is\r\n  inclined, from a mistaken philanthropy, to break down all barriers\r\n  between them, come to Brazil. He cannot deny the deterioration\r\n  consequent upon an amalgamation of races, more wide-spread here than\r\n  in any other country in the world, and which is rapidly effacing the\r\n  best qualities of the white man, the negro, and the Indian, leaving a\r\n  mongrel nondescript type, deficient in physical and mental energy. At\r\n  a time when the new social status of the negro is a subject of vital\r\n  importance in our statesmanship, we should profit by the experience of\r\n  a country where, though slavery exists, there is far more liberality\r\n  toward the free negro than he has ever enjoyed in the United States.\r\n  Let us learn the double lesson: open all the advantages of education\r\n  to the negro, and give him every chance of success which culture gives\r\n  to the man who knows how to use it; but respect the laws of nature,\r\n  and let all our dealings with the black man tend to preserve, as far\r\n  as possible, the distinctness of his national characteristics, and the\r\n  integrity of our own.—L. A.\r\n\r\nFootnote 86:\r\n\r\n  For some remarks concerning the structural peculiarities of the\r\n  Indians and Negroes, see Appendix No. V.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X.\r\n               EXCURSION TO MAUHES AND ITS NEIGHBORHOOD.\r\n\r\n  LEAVE MANAOS.—ON BOARD THE “IBICUHY.”—NAVIGATION OF THE RIVER\r\n    RAMOS.—ASPECT OF THE BANKS.—ARRIVAL AT MAUHES.—SITUATION OF\r\n    MAUHES.—TUPINAMBARANAS.—CHARACTER OF POPULATION.—APPEARANCE OF\r\n    THE VILLAGES OF MAUHES.—BOLIVIAN INDIANS.—GUARANÀ.—EXCURSION\r\n    TO MUCAJA-TUBA.—MUNDURUCU INDIANS.—ASPECT OF\r\n    VILLAGE.—CHURCH.—DISTRIBUTION OF PRESENTS.—GENEROSITY OF THE\r\n    INDIANS.—THEIR INDIFFERENCE.—VISIT TO ANOTHER\r\n    SETTLEMENT.—RETURN TO MAUHES.—ARRIVAL OF MUNDURUCUS IN THE\r\n    VILLAGE.—DESCRIPTION OF TATTOOING.—COLLECTION.—BOTO.—INDIAN\r\n    SUPERSTITIONS.—PALM COLLECTION.—WALK IN THE FOREST.—LEAVE\r\n    MAUHES.—MUNDURUCU INDIAN AND HIS WIFE.—THEIR MANNERS AND\r\n    APPEARANCE.—INDIAN TRADITION.—DISTINCTIONS OF CASTE.\r\n\r\n\r\n_December 12th._—We left Manaos, according to our intention, on Sunday\r\nevening (the 10th), raising the anchor with military exactness at five\r\no’clock, the very moment appointed, somewhat to the disappointment of a\r\nboatful of officials from the National Guard, who were just on their way\r\nto pay their parting compliments to the President, at the hour fixed for\r\nhis departure. In Brazil it may safely be assumed that things will\r\nalways be a little behind time; on this occasion, however, our\r\npunctuality was absolute, and the officers were forced to wave their\r\nadieux as we proceeded on our way, leaving their canoe behind. The hour\r\nwas of good omen,—a cool breeze, the one blessing for which the\r\ntraveller sighs in these latitudes, blowing up the Amazons; and as we\r\nleft the Rio Negro, it lay behind us, a golden pathway to the setting\r\nsun, which was going down in a blaze of glory. We were received on board\r\nwith all possible hospitality by the commander, Captain Faria. He has\r\nmade every arrangement for our comfort which a vessel of war, not\r\nintended for passengers, can afford, giving up his own quarters for my\r\naccommodation. On deck he has arranged a little recess, sheltered by a\r\ntarpaulin from the sun and rain, to serve as a dining-room, that we may\r\ntake our meals in the fresh air instead of dining in the close cabin\r\nbelow decks intended for this purpose.\r\n\r\nThe morning following our departure was an interesting one, because we\r\nfound ourselves at the mouth of the Ramos, unknown to steam navigation,\r\nand about which the Captain had some apprehensions, as he was by no\r\nmeans sure that he should find water enough for his vessel. It was,\r\ntherefore, necessary to proceed with great caution, sounding at every\r\nstep and sending out boats in advance, to ascertain the direction of the\r\nchannel. Once within the river, we had depth of water enough to float\r\nmuch larger vessels. The banks of this stream are beautiful. The forest\r\nwas gay with color, and the air laden with the rich perfume of flowers,\r\nwhich, when we came up the Amazons six months ago, were not yet in\r\nbloom. We were struck also with the great abundance and variety of the\r\npalms, so much more numerous on the lower course of the Amazons than on\r\nthe Solimoens. The shores were dotted with thrifty-looking plantations,\r\nlaid out with a neatness and care which bespeak greater attention to\r\nagriculture than we have seen elsewhere. Healthy-looking cattle were\r\ngrazing about many of the sitios. As the puff of our steam was heard,\r\nthe inhabitants ran out to gaze in amazement at the unwonted visitant,\r\nstanding in groups on the shores, almost too much lost in wonder to\r\nreturn our greetings. The advent of a steamer in their waters should be\r\nto them a welcome harbinger of the time, perhaps not far distant, when,\r\ninstead of their present tedious and uncertain canoe journeys to Serpa\r\nor Villa Bella, they will be able to transport their produce to either\r\nof these points in a few hours, in small steamboats, connecting all\r\nthese settlements, and adapted to the navigation. Any such prophetic\r\nvision was, however, no doubt very far from their thoughts; if they had\r\nany idea as to the object of our coming, it was probably a fear lest we\r\nshould be on a recruiting expedition. If so, it is certainly a very\r\ninnocent one, fishes being the only recruits we aim at entrapping. From\r\nthe Ramos we turned into the Mauhes, ascending to the town of the same\r\nname, where to-day we are enjoying the hospitality of Mr. Michelis.\r\n\r\nIf any of my readers are as ignorant as I was myself before making this\r\nvoyage, a bit of geography may not be out of place here. As everybody\r\nknows, the river Madeira, that great affluent of the Amazons, all whose\r\nchildren are giants, except when compared with their royal father,\r\nenters the main stream on its southern side at a point nearly opposite\r\nSerpa. But this is not its only connection with the Amazons. The river\r\nMauhes starting about twenty-five leagues from its mouth, runs from the\r\nriver Madeira almost parallel with the Amazons until it joins the river\r\nRamos, which continues its course in the same direction to a lower\r\npoint, where it empties into the main stream. The district of land thus\r\nenclosed between four rivers, having the Madeira on the west, the\r\nAmazons on the north, and the Ramos and the Mauhes on the south, is\r\nknown on the map as the island of Tupinambaranas. It is a network of\r\nrivers, lakes, and islands; one of those watery labyrinths which would\r\nbe in itself an extensive river system in any other country, but is here\r\nabsolutely lost in the world of waters of which it forms a part. Indeed,\r\nthe vastness of the Amazons is not felt chiefly when following its main\r\ncourse, but rather on its lesser tributaries, where streams to which a\r\nplace on the map is hardly accorded are found to be in fact large\r\nrivers.\r\n\r\nThe region of Mauhes is comparatively little known, because it is off\r\nthe line of steam navigation; but, thanks to the efforts of its most\r\nprominent citizen, Mr. Michelis, who has made his home there for\r\ntwenty-five years, and contributed, by his energy, intelligence, and\r\nhonorable character, to raise the tone of the whole district, it is one\r\nof the most prosperous in the province. It is melancholy to see how\r\nlittle is done in other districts, when an instance like this shows what\r\none man can do to improve the forest population along the banks of the\r\nAmazons. His example and its successful results should be an\r\nencouragement to all intelligent settlers on the Amazons. The little\r\nvillage of Mauhes stands on a sort of terrace, in front of which, at\r\nthis season when the waters are still considerably below high-water\r\nmark, runs a broad, white beach, rendered all the prettier at the moment\r\nof our arrival by a large party of Bolivian Indians, who had built their\r\ncamp-fires on its sands. We looked at these people with a kind of\r\nwonder, thinking of the perilous voyages they constantly make in their\r\nheavily-laden canoes, forced to unload their cargo over and over again\r\nas they shoot the cataracts of the Madeira on their way down, or drag\r\ntheir boats wearily up them on their return. It seems strange, when this\r\nriver is the highway of commerce from Bolivia, Matto-Grosso, and through\r\nMatto-Grosso from Paraguay to the Amazons, that the suggestion made by\r\nMajor Coutinho in his interesting account of his journey on the Rio\r\nMadeira, has not been adopted. He says that a road carried along the\r\nshore of the river for a distance of forty leagues would obviate all the\r\ndifficulty and danger of this arduous journey.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mauhes River.]\r\n\r\nMauhes is not a cluster of houses, but is built in line along a broad,\r\ngrass-grown street running the length of the terrace formed by the top\r\nof the river-bank. In an open space, at one end of this village street,\r\nstands the church, a small but neat-looking building, with a wooden\r\ncross in front. Most of the houses are low and straw-thatched, but here\r\nand there a more substantial house, with tiled roof, like that of Mr.\r\nMichelis, breaks the ordinary level of the buildings. Notwithstanding\r\nthe modest appearance of this little town, all who know something of its\r\nhistory speak of it as one of the most promising of the Amazonian\r\nsettlements, and as having a better moral tone than usually prevails.\r\nOne of its great staples is the Guaraná. This shrub, or rather vine,—for\r\nit is a trailing plant somewhat like our high-bush blackberry,—is about\r\neight feet high when full grown, and bears a bean the size of a\r\ncoffee-bean, two being enclosed in each envelope. This bean, after being\r\nroasted, is pounded in a small quantity of water, until it becomes, when\r\nthoroughly ground, a compact paste, and when dry is about the color of\r\nchocolate, though much harder. In this state it is grated, (the grater\r\nbeing always the rough tongue of the Pirarucu,) and when mixed with\r\nsugar and water it makes a very pleasant, refreshing drink. It is said\r\nto have medicinal properties also, and is administered with excellent\r\neffect in cases of diarrhœa. In certain parts of Brazil it is very\r\nextensively used as well as in Bolivia, and will, no doubt, have a wider\r\ndistribution when its value is more generally known. The Indians display\r\nno little fancy in the manufacture of this article, moulding the paste\r\ninto the shape of mounted soldiers, horses, birds, serpents, &c.\r\n\r\nThis morning I was attracted by voices in the street, and going to the\r\nwindow I saw the door of the house where the President is lodged\r\nbesieged by a crowd of Bolivian Indians. They had brought some of their\r\nrobes to sell, and it was not long before several of our party, among\r\nwhom were ready purchasers, made their appearance in Bolivian costume.\r\nThis dress is invariable; always the long robe, composed of two pieces,\r\none hanging before, the other behind, belted around the waist and\r\nfastened on the shoulders, with an opening for the head to pass through.\r\nSuch a robe, with a broad-brimmed, coarse straw hat, constitutes the\r\nwhole dress of these people. Their ordinary working garb is made of\r\nbark; their better robe, for more festive occasions, consists of a\r\ntwilled cotton of their own manufacture, exceedingly soft and fine, but\r\nvery close and strong. These dresses may be more or less ornamented, but\r\nare always of the same shape. The Bolivian Indians seem to be more\r\nindustrious than those of the Amazons, or else they are under more\r\nrigorous discipline.\r\n\r\n_December 14th._—At the settlement of Mucaja-Tuba. Mucaja signifies a\r\nparticular kind of palm, very abundant here; Tuba means a place. Thus we\r\nare among the woods of Acrocomia. Yesterday we were to have left Mauhes\r\nwith the dawn on an excursion to this place, but at the appointed hour a\r\nflood of rain, such as is seen only in these latitudes, was pouring down\r\nin torrents, accompanied by thunder and lightning. The delay occasioned\r\nby this interruption, however, proved a good fortune in the end. By\r\neleven o’clock the storm was over, but the sky continued overcast during\r\nthe rest of the day. Our way lay up the river Mauhes, past the mouths of\r\nnameless streams and lakes,—broad sheets of water, perfectly unknown out\r\nof their immediate neighborhood. Night brought us to our destination,\r\nand at about eight o’clock we anchored before this little village. As we\r\napproached it a light or two was seen glimmering on the shore, and we\r\ncould not help again wondering what was the feeling of the people who\r\nsaw and heard for the first time one of these puffing steam monsters.\r\nThis morning, with a boat-load of goods of all sorts, intended by the\r\nPresident as presents for the Indians, we put off for the shore. Landing\r\non the beach we went at once to the house of the chief, a most\r\nrespectable looking old man, who stood at the door to receive us. He was\r\nan old acquaintance of Major Coutinho, having formerly accompanied him\r\non his exploration of the Rio Madeira. The inhabitants of this village\r\nare Mundurucu Indians, one of the most intelligent and kindly disposed\r\nof the Amazonian tribes. Although they are too civilized to be\r\nconsidered as illustrating in any way the wild life of the primitive\r\nIndians, yet, as it is the first time we have seen one of their isolated\r\nsettlements, removed from every civilizing influence except the\r\noccasional contact of the white man, the visit was especially\r\ninteresting to us. It is astonishing to see the size and solidity of\r\ntheir houses, with never a nail driven, the frame consisting of rough\r\ntrunks bound together by withes made of long, elastic sipos, the cordage\r\nof the forest. Major Coutinho tells us that they know very well the use\r\nof nails in building, and say to one another derisively, when they want\r\nanother sipo, “Hand me a nail.” The ridge-pole of this chief’s house\r\ncould not have been less than twenty-five to thirty-eight feet high, and\r\nthe room was spacious in proportion. Hammocks were hung in the corners,\r\none of which was partitioned off by a low wall of palm-thatch; bows and\r\narrows, guns and oars, hung on the walls or were leaning against them,\r\nand adjoining this central apartment was the mandioca kitchen. There\r\nwere a number of doors and windows in the room, closed by large\r\npalm-mats. The house of the chief stood at the head of a line of houses\r\ndiffering from his only in being somewhat smaller; they made one side of\r\nan open square, on the opposite side of which was a corresponding row of\r\nbuildings. With a few exceptions these houses were empty, for the\r\npopulation gather only three or four times in the course of the year, at\r\ncertain festival seasons. Generally they are scattered about in their\r\ndifferent sitios, attending to their plantations. But at these fêtes\r\nthey assemble to the number of several hundred, all the dwellings are\r\ncrowded with families, and the square in the centre is cleared of grass,\r\nswept and garnished for their evening dances. Such festivities last for\r\nten days or a fortnight; then they all disperse to their working life\r\nagain. At this time there are not more than thirty or forty persons in\r\nthe village. The most interesting object we saw was their church, which\r\nstands at the head of the square, and was built entirely by the Indians\r\nthemselves. It is quite a large structure, capable of holding an\r\nassembly of five or six hundred persons. The walls are of mud, very\r\nneatly finished inside, and painted in colors made by the Indians from\r\nthe bark, roots, and fruits of certain trees, and also from a particular\r\nkind of clay. The front part of the church is wholly unfurnished, except\r\nfor the rough wooden font standing just within the door. But the farther\r\nend is partitioned off to make a neat chancel, within which several\r\nsteps lead up to the altar and niche above, where is placed the rude\r\nimage of the Mother and the Child. Of course the architecture and the\r\nornaments are of the coarsest description; the painting consists only of\r\nstripes or lines of blue, red, and yellow, with here and there an\r\nattempt at a star or a diamond, or a row of scalloping; but there is\r\nsomething touching in the idea that these poor, uneducated people of the\r\nforest have cared to build themselves a temple with their own hands,\r\nlavishing upon it such ideas of beauty and taste as they have, and\r\nbringing at least their best to their humble altar. None of our city\r\nchurches, on which millions have been expended, have power to move one\r\nlike this church, the loving work of the worshippers themselves, with\r\nits mud walls so coarsely painted, its wooden cross before the door, and\r\nlittle thatched belfry at one side. It is sad that these people, with so\r\nmuch religious sensibility, are not provided with any regular service.\r\nAt long intervals a priest, on his round of visitations, makes his way\r\nto them, but, except on such rare occasions, they have no one to\r\nadminister the rites of burial or baptism, or to give religious\r\ninstruction to them or to their children. And yet their church was\r\nfaultlessly clean, the mud floor was strewn with fresh green leaves, and\r\neverything about the building showed it to be the object of solicitude\r\nand care. Their houses were very neat, and they themselves were decently\r\ndressed in the invariable costume of the civilized Indian,—the men in\r\ntrousers and white cotton shirts, the women in calico petticoats, with\r\nshort, loose chemises, either of cotton or calico, and their long, thick\r\nblack hair drawn up and fastened on the top of their head by a\r\nsemicircular comb, brought so far forward that the edge is about on a\r\nline with the forehead. A bunch of flowers is generally stuck under the\r\ncomb on one side. I have never seen an Indian woman who did not wear one\r\nof these round combs; although of foreign manufacture, they find their\r\nway to the most isolated forest settlements, brought, I suppose, by the\r\ntravelling pedlers, “regataō.” These gentry are known everywhere on the\r\nbanks of the Amazons and its tributaries, and are said to be most\r\nunprincipled in their dealings with the Indians, who fall readily into\r\nthe traps set for them by the wily traders. In one of the reports of Dr.\r\nAdolfo, who, during his short but able administration, exposed, and as\r\nfar as it was in his power reformed, abuses in the province of the\r\nAmazonas, he says, after speaking of the great need of religious\r\ninstruction in the more remote settlements: “To-day who goes to seek the\r\nIndian in the depth of his virgin forests along the shores of these\r\nendless rivers? No one, if it be not the ‘regataō,’ less barbarous\r\ncertainly than he, but much more corrupt; who spies upon him, depraves\r\nand dishonors him, under the pretext of trading.” After our visit to the\r\nchurch, the whole population, men, women, and children, accompanied us\r\ndown to the beach to receive their presents, distributed by the\r\nPresident in person: common jewelry, which they appreciate highly,\r\ncalico dresses, beads, scissors, needles, and looking-glasses for the\r\nwomen; knives, fish-hooks, hatchets, and other working tools for the\r\nmen; and a variety of little trinkets and playthings for the children.\r\nBut though a cordial, kindly people, they have the impassiveness of the\r\ngenuine Indian. I did not see a change of expression on any face or hear\r\na word of acknowledgment or pleasure. The only smile was when, being\r\ntired with standing in the sun, I sat down among the women, and, as the\r\nthings were passed rapidly around the circle, I was taken for one of\r\nthem, and received a very gay gown for my share. This caused a general\r\nshout of laughter, and seemed to delight them greatly. We returned to\r\nthe steamer to breakfast at ten o’clock, and in the afternoon the whole\r\nvillage came out to satisfy their curiosity about the vessel. They are a\r\ngenerous people. I never go among them without receiving some little\r\npresent, which it would be an insult to refuse. Such as they have they\r\noffer to the stranger; it may be a fruit, or a few eggs, or a chicken, a\r\ncuia, a basket or a bunch of flowers, but their feelings would be\r\nwounded were you to go away empty-handed. On this occasion the daughter\r\nof the chief brought me a fine fat fowl, another woman gave me a basket,\r\nand another a fruit which resembles very much our winter squash, and is\r\nused in the same way. I was glad to have with me some large beads and a\r\nfew little pictures of saints with which to acknowledge their gifts. But\r\nI believe they do not think of any return; it is simply a rite of\r\nhospitality with them to make their guest a present. They went over the\r\nvessel, heard the cannon fired off, and, as the captain took them on a\r\nlittle excursion, they saw the machine and the wheels in action; but\r\nthey looked at all with the same calm, quiet air of acceptance, above,\r\nor perhaps one should rather say below, any emotion of surprise. For is\r\nnot the readiness to receive new impressions, to be surprised,\r\ndelighted, moved, one of the great gifts of the white race, as different\r\nfrom the impassiveness of the Indian as their varying complexion from\r\nthe dark skin, which knows neither blush nor pallor? We could have but\r\nlittle conversation with these people, for, with the exception of the\r\nchief and one or two men who acted as interpreters, they spoke only the\r\n“lingua geral,” and did not understand Portuguese.\r\n\r\n_December 15th._—After the Indians had left us yesterday, we proceeded\r\non our way to another settlement, where we expected to find a\r\nconsiderable village. We arrived after dark, and some of the party went\r\non shore; but they found only a grass-grown path and deserted houses.\r\nThe whole population was in the forest. To-day, however, two or three\r\ncanoesful of people have come off to the steamer to greet the President\r\nand receive their presents. Among them was an old woman who must have\r\ncome originally from some more primitive settlement. The lower part of\r\nher face was tattooed in a bluish-black tint, covering the mouth and\r\nlower part of the cheeks to the base of the ears. Below this the chin\r\nwas tattooed in a kind of network, no doubt considered very graceful and\r\nbecoming in her day and generation. A black line was drawn across the\r\nnose, and from the outer corner of the eyes to the ears, giving the\r\neffect of a pair of spectacles. The upper part of the breast was\r\ntattooed in an open-work, headed by two straight lines drawn around the\r\nshoulders as if to represent a coarse lace finish, such as one\r\nconstantly sees around the necks of their chemises. They left us at\r\nbreakfast, and we are now on our way back to Mauhes, after a most\r\ninteresting excursion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mundurucu Indian (Male).[87]]\r\n\r\n_December 16th._—Mauhes. We arrived here yesterday at midday, and, as it\r\nhappened, we found in the village an Indian and his wife, who, as\r\nspecimens of the genuine Mundurucus, were more interesting than those we\r\nhad visited. They came on trading business from a distant settlement\r\nsome twenty days’ journey from Mauhes. The man’s whole face is tattooed\r\nin bluish black, this singular mask being finished on the edge by a\r\nfine, open pattern, about half an inch broad, running around the jaws\r\nand chin. His ears are pierced with very large holes, from which, when\r\nhis costume is complete, pieces of wood are suspended, and his whole\r\nbody is covered with a neat and intricate network of tattooing. At\r\npresent, however, being in civilized regions, he is dressed in trousers\r\nand shirt. In the woman the mask of tattooing covers only the lowest\r\npart of the face, the upper part being free, with the exception of the\r\nline across the nose and eyes. Her chin and neck are also ornamented\r\nlike that of the old woman we saw yesterday. They speak no Portuguese,\r\nand seem rather reluctant to answer the questions of the interpreter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mundurucu Indian (Female).]\r\n\r\nMr. Agassiz has been very fortunate in collecting in this region.\r\nAlthough we are at so short a distance from Manaos, where he already\r\nknows the fishes tolerably well, he finds a surprising number of new\r\ngenera and species about Mauhes and its neighborhood. As usual, wherever\r\nwe go, everybody turns naturalist in his behalf. Our kind friend, the\r\nPresident, always ready to do everything in his power to facilitate his\r\nresearches, has several boats out, manned by the best fishermen of the\r\nplace, fishing for him. The commander, while his ship lies at anchor,\r\nhas his men employed in the same way; and Mr. Michelis and his friends\r\nare also indefatigable. Occasionally, however, in the midst of his\r\nsuccesses, he has to bear disappointments, arising from the ignorance\r\nand superstition of the working people. Ever since he came to the\r\nAmazons he has been trying to obtain a specimen of a peculiar kind of\r\nporpoise, native to these waters. It is, however, very difficult to\r\nobtain, because, being useless for food, there is nothing to induce the\r\nIndian to overcome the difficulty of catching it. Mr. Michelis has,\r\nhowever, impressed upon the fishermen the value of the prize, and,\r\nyesterday evening, just as we were rising from the dinner-table, it was\r\nannounced that one was actually on its way up from the beach. Followed\r\nby the whole party of sympathizing friends,—for all had caught the\r\ninfection,—Mr. Agassiz hastened out to behold his long-desired treasure;\r\nand there was his Boto, but sadly mutilated, for one Indian had cut off\r\na piece of the fin as a cure for a sick person, another had taken out an\r\neye as a love-charm, which, if it could be placed near the person of the\r\ngirl he loved, would win him her favor, and so on. Injured as it was,\r\nMr. Agassiz was, nevertheless, very glad to have the specimen; but he\r\nlocked it up carefully for the night, not knowing what other titbits\r\nmight be coveted by the superstitious inhabitants.\r\n\r\n_December 18th._—In the midst of the zoölogical work, the collection of\r\npalms, which is now becoming very considerable, is not forgotten. This\r\nmorning we went into the forest for the purpose of gathering young palms\r\nto compare with the full-grown ones, already cut down and put up for\r\ntransportation. In these woods a thousand objects attract the eye,\r\nbeside that which you especially seek. How many times we stopped to\r\nwonder at some lofty tree which was a world of various vegetation in\r\nitself, parasites established in all its nooks and corners, sipos\r\nhanging from its branches or twining themselves so close against the\r\nbark that they often seem as if sculptured on its trunk; or paused to\r\nlisten to the quick rustle of the wind in palm-leaves fifty feet above\r\nour heads, not at all like the slow, gathering rush of the wind in\r\npine-trees at home, but like rapidly running water. Through the narrow\r\npath an immense butterfly, of that vivid blue which excites our wonder\r\nin collections of Brazilian insects, came sailing towards us. He\r\nalighted in our immediate neighborhood, folding all his azure glories\r\nout of sight, and looking, when still, like a great brown moth, spotted\r\nwith white. We crept softly nearer, but the first leaf trodden under\r\nfoot warned him, and he was off again, dazzling us with the beauty of\r\nhis wonderful coloring as he opened his wings and, bidding us a gay\r\ngood-by, vanished among the trees. The sailing motion of these Morphos,\r\nthough rapid, contrasts strikingly with the more fluttering flight of\r\nthe Heliconians. The former give broad, strong strokes with their wide\r\nwings, the latter beat the air with quick, impatient, tremulous\r\nmovements.\r\n\r\n_December 20th._—This morning we left Mauhes, accompanied by our\r\nMundurucu Indian and his wife. The President takes them to Manaos, in\r\nthe hope of obtaining their portraits to enlarge Mr. Agassiz’s\r\ncollection. I am interested in watching the deportment of these people,\r\nwhich is marked by a striking propriety that wins respect. They have\r\nremained in the seat where the Captain has placed them, not moving,\r\nexcept to bring their little baggage, from which the woman has taken out\r\nher work and is now busy in sewing, while her husband makes cigarette\r\nenvelopes from a bark used by the Indians for this purpose;—certainly\r\nvery civilized occupations for savages. As they speak no Portuguese, we\r\ncan only communicate with them through the interpreter or through Mr.\r\nCoutinho, who has considerable familiarity with the “lingua geral.” They\r\nseem more responsive, more ready to enter into conversation now than\r\nwhen we first saw them; but the woman, when addressed, or when anything\r\nis offered to her, invariably turns to her husband, as if the decision\r\nof everything rested with him. It might be thought that the fantastic\r\nornaments of these Indians would effectually disguise all pretence to\r\nbeauty; but it is not so with this pair. Their features are fine, the\r\nbuild of the face solid and square, but not clumsy, and there is a\r\npassive dignity in their bearing which makes itself felt, spite of their\r\ntattooing. I have never seen anything like the calm in the man’s face;\r\nit is not the stolidity of dulness, for his expression is sagacious and\r\nobservant, but a look of such abiding tranquillity that you cannot\r\nimagine that it ever has been or ever will be different. The woman’s\r\nface is more mobile; occasionally a smile lights it up, and her\r\nexpression is sweet and gentle. Even her painted spectacles do not\r\ndestroy the soft, drooping look in the eyes, very common among the\r\nIndian women here, and, as it would seem, characteristic of the women in\r\nthe South American tribes; for Humboldt speaks of it in those of the\r\nSpanish provinces to the north.\r\n\r\nMajor Coutinho tells us that the tattooing has nothing to do with\r\nindividual taste, but that the pattern is appointed for both sexes, and\r\nis invariable throughout the tribe. It is connected with their caste,\r\nthe limits of which are very precise, and with their religion. The\r\ntradition runs thus, childish and inconsequent, like all such primitive\r\nfables. The first man, Caro Sacaibu, was also divine. Associated with\r\nhim was his son, and an inferior being named Rairu, to whom, although he\r\nwas as it were his prime minister and executed his commands, Caro\r\nSacaibu was inimical. Among other stratagems he used to get rid of him\r\nwas the following. He made a figure in imitation of a tatu (armadillo),\r\nand buried it partly in the earth, leaving only the tail exposed. He\r\ncovered the tail with a kind of oil, which when touched adheres to the\r\nskin. He then commanded Rairu to drag the half-buried tatu out of its\r\nhole and bring it to him. Rairu seized it by the tail, but was of course\r\nunable to withdraw his hand, and the tatu, suddenly endowed with life by\r\nthe Supreme Being, dived into the earth, dragging Rairu with him. The\r\nstory does not say how Rairu found his way out of the earth again, but,\r\nbeing a spirit of great cunning and invention, he contrived to reach the\r\nupper air once more. On his return, he informed Caro Sacaibu that he had\r\nfound in the earth a great many men and women, and that it would be an\r\nexcellent thing to get them out to till the soil and make themselves\r\nuseful above ground. This advice seems to have found favor in the sight\r\nof Caro Sacaibu, who forthwith planted a seed in the ground. From this\r\nseed sprang a cotton-tree, for into this fantastic tale is thus woven\r\nthe origin of cotton. The tree throve and grew apace, and from the soft\r\nwhite contents of its pods Caro Sacaibu made a long thread, with one end\r\nof which Rairu descended once more into the earth by the same hole\r\nthrough which he had entered before. He collected the people together,\r\nand they were dragged up through the hole by means of the thread. The\r\nfirst who came out were small and ugly, but gradually they improved in\r\ntheir personal appearance, until at last the men began to be finely\r\nformed and handsome, and the women beautiful. Unfortunately, by this\r\ntime the thread was much worn, and being too weak to hold them, the\r\ngreater number of handsome people fell back into the hole and were lost.\r\nIt is for this reason that beauty is so rare a gift in the world. Caro\r\nSacaibu now separated the population he had thus drawn from the bowels\r\nof the earth, dividing them into different tribes, marking them with\r\ndistinct colors and patterns, which they have since retained, and\r\nappointing their various occupations. At the end there remained over a\r\nresidue, consisting of the ugliest, smallest, most insignificant\r\nrepresentatives of the human race; to these he said, drawing at the same\r\ntime a red line over their noses, “You are not worthy to be men and\r\nwomen,—go and be animals.” And so they were changed into birds, and ever\r\nsince, the Mutums, with their red beaks and melancholy wailing voices,\r\nwander through the woods.\r\n\r\nThe tattooing of the Mundurucus is not only connected with this dim idea\r\nof a primitive creative command; it is also indicative of aristocracy. A\r\nman who neglected this distinction would not be respected in his tribe;\r\nand so strong is this traditional association, that, even in civilized\r\nsettlements where tattooing is no longer practised, an instinctive\r\nrespect is felt for this mark of nobility. A Mundurucu Indian, tattooed\r\nafter the ancient fashion of his tribe, arriving in a civilized village,\r\nsuch as the one we visited, is received with the honor due to a person\r\nof rank. “Il faut souffrir pour être beau,” was never truer than among\r\nthese savages. It requires not less than ten years to complete the\r\ntattooing of the whole face and body; the operation being performed,\r\nhowever, only at intervals. The color is introduced by fine puncturings\r\nover the whole surface; a process which is often painful, and causes\r\nswelling and inflammation, especially on such sensitive parts as the\r\neyelids. The purity of type among the Mundurucus is protected by\r\nstringent laws against close intermarriages. The tribe is divided into\r\ncertain orders or classes, more or less closely allied; and so far do\r\nthey carry their respect for that law, which, though recognized in the\r\ncivilized world, is so constantly sinned against, that marriage is\r\nforbidden, not only between members of the same family, but between\r\nthose of the same order. A Mundurucu Indian treats a woman of the same\r\norder with himself as a sister; any nearer relation between them is\r\nimpossible. Major Coutinho, who has made a very careful study of the\r\nmanners and habits of these people, assures us that there is no law more\r\nsacred among them, or more rigidly observed, than this one. Their fine\r\nphysique, for which they are said to be remarkable, is perhaps owing to\r\nthis. They are free from one great source of degeneration of type. It is\r\nto be hoped that Major Coutinho, who, while making his explorations as\r\nan engineer on the Amazonian rivers, has also made a careful study of\r\nthe tribes living along their margins, will one day publish the result\r\nof his investigations. It is to him we owe the greater part of the\r\ninformation we have collected on this subject.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 87:\r\n\r\n  I did not succeed in getting good likenesses of this Mundurucu pair.\r\n  The above wood-cuts do no justice to their features and expression,\r\n  though they give a faithful record of the peculiar mode of\r\n  tattooing.—L.

The Indians have a pretty observance here for\r\nChristmas eve. At nightfall, from the settlements at Hyanuary, two\r\nilluminated canoes come across the river to Manaos; one bearing the\r\nfigure of Our Lady, the other of Saint Rosalia. They look very brilliant\r\nas they come towards the shore, all the light concentrated about the\r\nfigures carried erect in the prows. On landing, the Indians, many of\r\nwhom have come to the city in advance, form a procession,—the women\r\ndressed in white, and with flowers in their hair, the men carrying\r\ntorches or candles; and they follow the sacred images, which are borne\r\nunder a canopy in front of the procession, to the church, where they are\r\ndeposited, and remain during Christmas week. We entered with them, and\r\nsaw the kneeling, dusky congregation, and the two saints,—one a wooden,\r\ncoarsely painted image of the Virgin, the other a gayly dressed\r\ndoll,—placed on a small altar, where was also a figure of the infant\r\nJesus, surrounded by flowers. At a later hour the midnight mass was\r\ncelebrated; less interesting to me than the earlier ceremony, because\r\nnot so exclusively a service of the Indians, though they formed a large\r\npart of the congregation; and the music, as usual, was performed by the\r\nband of Indian boys from the Casa dos Educandos. But there is nothing\r\nhere to make the Catholic service impressive; the churches on the\r\nAmazons generally are of the most ordinary kind, and in a ruinous\r\ncondition. There is a large unfinished stone church in Manaos, standing\r\non the hill, and occupying a commanding position, which will make it a\r\nconspicuous object if it is ever completed; but it has stood in its\r\npresent state for years, and seems likely to remain so for an indefinite\r\nlength of time. It is a pity they have not the custom here of dressing\r\ntheir churches with green at Christmas, because they have so singularly\r\nbeautiful and appropriate a tree for it in the palms. The Pupunha palm,\r\nfor instance, so architectural in its symmetry, with its columnar-like\r\nstem and its dark-green vault of drooping leaves, would be admirable for\r\nthis purpose. To-morrow we leave Manaos in the “Ibicuhy,” in order to\r\nascend the Rio Negro as far as Pedreira, where the first granitic\r\nformation is said to occur.\r\n\r\n_December 27th._—On board the “Ibicuhy.” There was little incident to\r\nmark our day yesterday, and yet it was one full of enjoyment. The day\r\nitself was such as rarely occurs in these regions; indeed, I should say\r\nit is the only time, during the whole six months we have passed on the\r\nAmazons, when we have had cool weather with a clear sky. Cool weather\r\nhere is usually the result of rain. As soon as the sun shows his face\r\nthe heat is great. But yesterday a strong wind was blowing down the Rio\r\nNegro; and its usually black, still waters were freshened to blue, and\r\ntheir surface broken by white caps. It is a curious fact in the history\r\nof this river, that, while tributary to the Amazons, it also receives\r\nbranches from it. A little above its junction with the Solimoens, the\r\nlatter sends several small affluents into the Rio Negro, the entrance to\r\nwhich we passed yesterday. The contrast between their milky-white waters\r\nand the clear, dark, amber tint of the main river makes them very\r\nconspicuous. It would seem that this is not a solitary instance of river\r\nformation in this gigantic fresh-water system; for Humboldt says,\r\nspeaking of the double communication between the Cassiquiare and the Rio\r\nNegro, and the great number of branches by which the Rio Branco and the\r\nRio Hyapura enter into the Rio Negro and the Amazons: “At the confluence\r\nof the Hyapura there is a much more extraordinary phenomenon. Before\r\nthis river joins the Amazons, the latter, which is the principal\r\nrecipient, sends off three branches, called Uaranapu, Manhama, and\r\nAvateparana, to the Hyapura, which is but a tributary stream. The\r\nPortuguese astronomer, Ribeiro, has proved this important fact. The\r\nAmazons gives waters to the Hyapura itself before it receives that\r\ntributary stream.” So does it also to the Rio Negro.\r\n\r\nThe physiognomy of the Rio Negro is peculiar, and very different from\r\nthat of the Amazons or the Solimoens. The shores jut out in frequent\r\npromontories, which, while they form deep bays between, narrow the river\r\nfrom distance to distance, and, as we advance towards them, look like\r\nthe entrances to harbors or lakes. Indeed, we have already passed\r\nseveral large lakes; but great sheets of water so abound here that they\r\nare nameless, and hardly attract attention. The vegetation also is\r\ndifferent from that of the Amazons. As yet we have seen few palms; and\r\nthe forest is characterized by a great number of trees, the summits of\r\nwhich are evenly and gently arched, forming flattened domes. The most\r\nremarkable of these, on account of its lofty height and spreading\r\nfoliage, is the Sumauméra, to which I have alluded before. But this\r\numbrella-like mode of growth is by no means confined to one tree, but,\r\nlike the buttressed trunks, characterizes a number of Brazilian trees.\r\nIt is, however, more frequent here than we have seen it elsewhere. The\r\nshores seem very scantily inhabited; indeed, during our whole journey\r\nyesterday, we met but one canoe, which we hailed, in order to inquire\r\nour distance from the little hamlet of Taua Péassu, where we meant to\r\ndrop anchor for the night. It was the boat of an Indian family going\r\ndown the river. We were reminded that we were leaving inhabited regions,\r\nfor the man who was rowing was quite naked; his wife and children peeped\r\nout from under the tolda in the stern of the boat. We received from them\r\nthe welcome intelligence that we were not far from our destination,\r\nwhere we accordingly arrived soon after nightfall. At this hour we could\r\nform but little idea of the appearance of the place; yet, by the\r\nmoonlight, we could see that its few houses (some eight or ten, perhaps)\r\nstood on a crescent-shaped terrace, formed by the bank of a little bay\r\nwhich puts in just at this point. The gentlemen went on shore, and\r\nbrought back the padre of the village to tea. He seems a man of a good\r\ndeal of intelligence, and was eloquent upon the salubrity of the\r\nvillage, its freedom from mosquitoes, piums, and all kinds of noxious\r\ninsects. At first a life so remote and isolated seems a hard lot, and\r\none would think only the greatest devotion could induce a man to\r\nundertake it. But there is hardly a corner so remote in Brazil as not to\r\nbe reached by the petty local politics; and the padre is said to be a\r\ngreat politician, his campaign before election among the poor people\r\nwith whom his lot is cast being as exciting to him as that of any man\r\nwho canvasses in a more distinguished arena; the more satisfactory,\r\nperhaps, because he has the game very much in his own hands. We left\r\nTaua Péassu with the dawn, and are again on our way to Pedreira. The\r\nweather still continues most favorable for travelling,—an overcast sky\r\nand a cool breeze. But to-day the black river sleeps without a ripple;\r\nand, as we pass along, the trees meet the water, and are so perfectly\r\nreflected in it that we can hardly distinguish the dividing line. I have\r\nsaid that the forest is not characterized by palms, and yet we see many\r\nspecies which we have not met before; among these is the Jara-assú, with\r\nits tall, slender stem, and broom-like tuft of stiff leaves. Mr. Agassiz\r\nhas just gone on shore in the montaria, to cut down some palms of\r\nanother kind, new to him. As he returns, the little boat seems to have\r\nundergone some marvellous change; it looks like a green raft floating on\r\nthe water, and we can hardly see the figures of the rowers for the\r\nbeautiful crowns of the palm-trees.\r\n\r\n_December 29th._—Pedreira. I have said little about the insects and\r\nreptiles which play so large a part in most Brazilian travels, and,\r\nindeed, I have had much less annoyance from this source than I had\r\nexpected. But I must confess the creature who greeted my waking sight\r\nthis morning was not a pleasant object to contemplate. It was an\r\nenormous centipede close by my side, nearly a foot in length, whose\r\ninnumerable legs looked just ready for a start, and whose two horns or\r\nfeelers were protruded with a most venomous expression. These animals\r\nare not only hideous to look upon, but their bite is very painful,\r\nthough not dangerous. I crept softly away from my sofa without\r\ndisturbing my ugly neighbor, who presently fell a victim to science;\r\nbeing very adroitly caught under a large tumbler, and consigned to a\r\nglass jar filled with alcohol. Captain Faria says that centipedes are\r\noften brought on board with the wood, among which they usually lie\r\nconcealed, seldom making their appearance, unless disturbed and driven\r\nout of their hiding-place. To less noxious visitors of this kind one\r\ngets soon accustomed. As I shake out my dress, I hear a cold flop on the\r\nfloor, and a pretty little house-lizard, who has found a warm retreat in\r\nits folds, makes his escape with all celerity. Cockroaches swarm\r\neverywhere, and it would be a vigilant housekeeper who could keep her\r\nclosets free of them. Ants are the greatest nuisance of all, and the\r\nbite of the fire-ant is really terrible. I remember once, in Esperança’s\r\ncottage, having hung some towels to dry on the cord of my hammock; I was\r\nabout to remove them, when suddenly my hand and arm seemed plunged into\r\nfire. I dropped the towels as if they had been hot coals, which for the\r\nmoment they literally seemed to be, and then I saw that my arm was\r\ncovered with little brown ants. Brushing them off in all haste, I called\r\nLaudigari, who found an army of them passing over the hammock, and out\r\nof the window, near which it hung. He said they were on their way\r\nsomewhere, and, if left undisturbed, would be gone in an hour or two.\r\nAnd so it proved to be. We saw no more of them. Major Coutinho says\r\nthat, in certain Amazonian tribes, the Indian bridegroom is subjected to\r\na singular test. On the day of his marriage, while the wedding\r\nfestivities are going on, his hand is tied up in a paper bag filled with\r\nfire-ants. If he bears this torture smilingly and unmoved, he is\r\nconsidered fit for the trials of matrimony.\r\n\r\nYesterday we arrived at Pedreira, a little village consisting of some\r\nfifteen or twenty houses hemmed in by forest. The place certainly\r\ndeserves its name of the “place of stones,” for the shore is fringed\r\nwith rocks and boulders. We landed at once, and Mr. Coutinho and Mr.\r\nAgassiz spent the morning in geologizing and botanizing. In the course\r\nof our ramble we came upon an exceedingly picturesque Indian camp. The\r\nriver is now so high that the water runs far up into the forest. In such\r\nan overflowed wood, a number of Indian montarias were moored; while, on\r\na tract of dry land near by, the Indians had cleared a little grove,\r\ncutting down the inner trees, and leaving only the outer ones standing,\r\nso as to make a shady, circular arbor. Within this arbor the hammocks\r\nwere slung; while outside were the kettles and water-jugs, and utensils\r\nof one sort and another. In this little camp were several Indian\r\nfamilies, who had left their mandioca plantations in the forest, to pass\r\nthe Christmas festa in the village. I asked the women what they did,\r\nthey and their babies, of which there were a goodly number, when it\r\nrained; for a roof of foliage is poor shelter in these tropical rains,\r\ndescending, not in drops, but in sheets. They laughed, and, pointing to\r\ntheir canoes, said they crept under the tolda, the arched roof of\r\npalm-thatch which always encloses the stern of an Indian montaria, and\r\nwere safe. Even this, in the open river, would not be a protection; but,\r\nmoored as the boats are in the midst of a thick wood, they do not\r\nreceive the full force of the showers. In returning from our walk we\r\nstopped at a house where an Indian was making palm-thatch from the\r\nleaflets of the Curua palm. When quite young, they are packed closely\r\naround the midrib. The Indians turn them down, leaving them attached to\r\nthe axis by a few fibres only, so that, when the midrib is held up, they\r\nhang from it like so many straw-colored ribands, being, at that age, of\r\na very delicate color. With these leaves they thatch their walls and\r\nroofs, setting the midrib, which is strong and sometimes four or five\r\nyards long, across, to serve as a support, and binding down the pendent\r\nleaves. Such a thatch will last for years, and is an excellent\r\nprotection from rain as well as sun. I should add, that, in other parts\r\nof the country, different kinds of palms are used for this purpose.\r\n\r\nOn our return to the village we were met by the padre, who invited us to\r\nrest at his house, stopping on the way, at our request, to show us the\r\nchurch. The condition of a settlement is generally indicated by the\r\nstate of the church. This one was sadly in want of repairs, the mud\r\nwalls being pierced with more windows than they were originally intended\r\nto possess; but the interior was neat, and the altar prettier than one\r\nwould expect to find in so poor a place as Pedreira appears to be.\r\nPerhaps the church was in better order than usual, being indeed in\r\nfestival trim. Christmas week was not yet over, and the baby Christ lay\r\non his green bed in a little arbor of leaves and flowers, evidently made\r\nexpressly for the purpose. The padre of this little village, Father\r\nSamuel, an Italian priest, who has passed many years of his life among\r\nthe Indians of South America, partly in Bolivia and partly in Brazil,\r\nhad not so much to say in favor of the healthfulness of his parish as\r\nthe padre whom we had seen the night before in Taua Péassu. He told us\r\nthat intermittent fever, from which he had suffered much himself, is\r\nfrequent, and that the people are poorly and insufficiently fed. When\r\nthey have had no recent arrival from Manaos, neither coffee, sugar, tea,\r\nnor bread are to be had in the village. As there is no beach here, the\r\nfishing is done at a distance on the other side of the river; and when\r\nthe waters are very high, fish are not obtained even there. At such\r\ntimes the Indians live exclusively on farinha d’agua and water. This\r\nmeagre diet, though injurious to the health, satisfies the cravings of\r\nhunger with those accustomed to it; but the few whites in this solitary\r\nplace suffer severely. What a comment is this scarcity of food on the\r\nindolence and indifference of the population in a region where an\r\nimmense variety of vegetables might be cultivated with little labor,\r\nwhere the pasturage is excellent (as is attested by the fine condition\r\nof the few cows at Pedreira), and where coffee, cacao, cotton, and sugar\r\nhave a genial climate and soil, and yield more copious crops than in\r\nmany countries from which large exports of these productions are made!\r\nAnd yet, in this land of abundance, the people live in dread of actual\r\nwant. The village consists, as I have said, of some fifteen or twenty\r\nhouses, all of which are at this moment occupied; but Father Samuel\r\ntells us that we see the little place at its flood-tide, Christmas week\r\nhaving brought together the inhabitants of the neighborhood. They will\r\ndisperse again, after a few days, to their palm-houses and mandioca\r\nplantations in the forest; and the padre says that, on many a Sunday\r\nthroughout the year, his congregation consists only of himself and the\r\nboys who assist at the service.\r\n\r\nAfter we had rested for half an hour at the priest’s house, he proposed\r\nto send us to his little mandioca plantation at a short distance in the\r\nforest, where a particular kind of palm, which Mr. Agassiz greatly\r\ncoveted, was to be obtained. Such a proposition naturally suggests a\r\nwalk; but in this country of inundated surfaces land journeys, as will\r\nbe seen, are often made by water. We started in a montaria, and, after\r\nkeeping along the river for some time, we turned into the woods and\r\nbegan to navigate the forest. The water was still and clear as glass:\r\nthe trunks of the trees stood up from it, their branches dipped into it;\r\nand as we wound in and out among them, putting aside a bough here and\r\nthere, or stooping to float under a green arbor, the reflection of every\r\nleaf was so perfect that wood and water seemed to melt into each other,\r\nand it was difficult to say where the one began and the other ended.\r\nSilence and shade so profound brooded over the whole scene that the mere\r\nripple of our paddles seemed a disturbance. After half an hour’s row we\r\ncame to dry land, where we went on shore, taking our boatmen with us;\r\nand the wood soon resounded with the sound of their hatchets, as the\r\npalms fell under their blows. We returned with a boat-load of palms,\r\nbesides a number of plants of various kinds which we had not seen\r\nelsewhere. We reached the “Ibicuhy” just in time; for scarcely were we\r\nwell on board and in snug quarters again, when the heavens opened and\r\nthe floods came down. I am not yet accustomed to the miraculous force\r\nand profusion of these torrents of water, and every shower is a fresh\r\nsurprise. Yet the rainy season is no such impediment to travelling and\r\nworking as we had supposed it would be. The rain is by no means\r\ncontinuous, and there are often several days together of clear weather.\r\nIndeed, it no more rains all the time in the rainy season here than it\r\nsnows all the time in the winter with us. One word of the geology. The\r\nPedreira granite, of which we had heard, proves to be a granitoid\r\nmica-slate,—a highly metamorphic rock, indistinctly stratified, but\r\nresembling granite in its composition. It is in immediate contact with\r\nthe red drift which rests above it.\r\n\r\nThis morning we had a melancholy proof of the brutality of recruiting\r\nhere, of which we have already heard so much. Several Indians, who had\r\nbeen kept in confinement in Pedreira for some days, waiting for an\r\nopportunity to send them to Manaos, were brought out to the ship. These\r\npoor wretches had their feet passed through heavy blocks of wood, the\r\nholes being just large enough to fit around the ankles. Of course they\r\ncould only move with the greatest difficulty; and they were half pushed,\r\nhalf dragged up the side of the vessel, one of them having apparently\r\nsuch a fit of ague upon him that, when he was fairly landed on his feet,\r\nI could see him shake from my seat at a distance of half the deck. These\r\nIndians can speak no Portuguese: they cannot understand why they are\r\nforced to go; they only know that they are seized in the woods and\r\ntreated as if they were the worst criminals; punished with barbarity for\r\nno crime, and then sent to fight for the government which so misuses\r\nthem. To the honor of our commander be it said, that he showed the\r\ndeepest indignation at the condition in which these men were delivered\r\ninto his hands: he caused the blocks of wood to be sawed off their feet\r\nimmediately, gave them wine and food, and showed them every kindness. He\r\nprotested that the whole proceeding was illegal, and contrary to the\r\nintentions of the central authority. It is, however, the way in which\r\nthe recruiting is accomplished throughout this Indian district; and the\r\ndefence made by those who justify it is, that the Indians, like any\r\nother citizens, must fight for the maintenance of the laws which protect\r\nthem; that the government needs their services; and that this is the\r\nonly way to secure them, as they are very unwilling to go, and very\r\ncunning and agile in escaping. Beside these three men, there were two\r\nothers; one a volunteer, and the other from a better class, the pilot of\r\nthe cataract on the Rio Branco. A man so employed ought, for the sake of\r\nthe community, to be exempt from military service, as few persons\r\nunderstand the dangerous navigation of the river, where broken by\r\ncascades. He will doubtless be sent back when his case is represented to\r\nthe President of the province.\r\n\r\n_December 31st._—Again on our way back to Manaos, having made, on our\r\nreturn, another short stay at Taua Péassu, where, during the two days of\r\nour absence, the padre of the village had prepared a large collection of\r\npalms for Mr. Agassiz. Our collection of palms is becoming quite\r\nnumerous; and though they must of course, in the process of drying, lose\r\nall their beauty of coloring, we hope they may retain something of the\r\ngrace and dignity of their bearing. But even should this not be the\r\ncase, they will answer every purpose of study, as with each one\r\nspecimens of its fruit and flowers are preserved in alcohol. A palm has\r\njust been brought on board—the Baccába, or wine-palm (Œnocarpus)—from\r\nwhich the flowers droop in long crimson cords, with bright-green berries\r\nfrom distance to distance along their length, like an immense coral\r\ntassel, flecked here and there with green, hanging from the dark trunk\r\nof the tree. The mode of flowering of the cocoa-nut palm, which we see\r\neverywhere though it is not indigenous here, is very beautiful. The\r\nflowers burst from the sheath in a long plume of soft, creamy-white\r\nblossoms: such a plume is so heavy with the weight of pendent flowers\r\nthat it can hardly be lifted; and its effect is very striking, hanging\r\nhigh up on the trunk, just under the green vault of leaves. I think\r\nthere is nothing among the characteristic features of tropical scenery\r\nof which one forms less idea at home than of the palms. Their name is\r\nlegion; the variety of their forms, of their foliage, fruit, and\r\nflowers, is perfectly bewildering; and yet, as a group, their character\r\nis unmistakable. The following extracts are taken from Mr. Agassiz’s\r\nnotes on palms, written during this excursion on the Rio Negro.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fan Baccába (Œnocarpus distychius).]\r\n\r\n“The palms, as a natural group, stand out among all other plants with\r\nremarkable distinctness and individuality. And yet this common\r\ncharacter, uniting them so closely as a natural order, does not prevent\r\nthe most striking difference between various kinds of palms. As a whole,\r\nno family of trees is more similar; generically and specifically none is\r\nmore varied, even though other families include a greater number of\r\nspecies. Their differences seem to me to be determined in a great\r\nmeasure by the peculiar arrangement of their leaves; indeed, palms, with\r\ntheir colossal leaves, few in number, may be considered as ornamental\r\ndiagrams of the primary laws according to which the leaves of all plants\r\nthroughout the whole vegetable kingdom are arranged; laws now recognized\r\nby the most advanced botanists of the day, and designated by them as\r\nPhyllotaxis. The simplest arrangement in these mathematics of the\r\nvegetable world is that of the grasses, in which the leaves are placed\r\nalternately on opposite sides of the stem, thus dividing the space\r\naround it in equal halves. As the stem of the grasses elongates, these\r\npairs of leaves are found scattered along its length; and it is only in\r\nears or spikes of some genera that we find them growing so compactly on\r\nthe axis as to form a close head. Of this law of growth the palm known\r\nas the Baccába of Pará (Œnocarpus distychius) is an admirable\r\nillustration; its leaves being disposed in pairs one above another at\r\nthe summit of the stem, but in such immediate contact as to form a thick\r\ncrown. On account of this disposition of the leaves, its appearance is\r\ntotally different from that of any other palm with which I am\r\nacquainted. I do not know any palm in which the leaves are arranged in\r\nthree directions only, as in the reeds and sedges of our marshes, unless\r\nit be the Jacitara (Desmonchus), whose winding slender stem, however,\r\nmakes the observation uncertain. An arrangement in five different\r\ndirections is common in all those palms which, when young, have only a\r\ncluster of five fully developed leaves above the ground, with a\r\nspade-like sixth leaf rising from the centre. When full grown, they\r\nusually exhibit a crown of ten or fifteen leaves and more, divided into\r\ntiers of five, one above the other, but so close together that the whole\r\nappears like a rounded head. Sometimes, however, the crown is more open,\r\nas in the Maximiliana regia (Inaja), for instance, in which the stem is\r\nnot very high, and the leaves, always in cycles of five, spread\r\nslightly, so as to form an open vase rising from a slender stem. The\r\nAssai (Euterpe edulis) has an eight-leaved arrangement, and has never\r\nmore than a single cycle of leaves, though it may sometimes have seven\r\nleaves when the first of the old cycle has dropped, before the ninth,\r\nwith which the new cycle begins, has opened; or nine, if the first leaf\r\nof the new cycle (the ninth in number) has opened, before the first of\r\nthe old cycle has dropped. These leaves, of a delicate, pale green, are\r\ncut into a thousand leaflets, which tremble in the lightest breeze, and\r\ntell you that the air is stirring even when the heat seems breathless. A\r\nmore elegant and attractive diagram of the Phyllotaxis of ⅜ probably\r\ndoes not exist in nature. The common Cocoa-nut tree has its leaves\r\narranged according to the fraction of 5/13; but, though the crown\r\nconsists of several cycles of leaves, they do not form a close head,\r\nbecause the older ones become pendent, while the younger are more erect.\r\nThe Pupunha, or peach palm (Guilielma), follows the Phyllotaxis of 8/21;\r\nbut in this instance all the leaves are evenly arched over, so that the\r\nwhole forms a deep-green vault, the more beautiful from the rich color\r\nof the foliage. When the heavy cluster of ripe, red fruit hangs under\r\nthis dark vault, the tree is in its greatest beauty. As the leaves of\r\nthis palm are not so closely set in the younger specimens as in the\r\nolder ones, its aspect changes at different stages of growth; the leaves\r\nin the younger trees being distributed over a greater length of the\r\ntrunk, while, in the adult taller ones, they are more compact. This\r\narrangement is repeated in the Javari and Tucuma (Astrocaryum); but in\r\nthese the closely-set leaves stand erect, broom-like, at the head of the\r\nlong stalk. In the Mucaja (Acrocomia) the leaves are arranged according\r\nto the fraction 13/34. Thus, under the same fundamental principle of\r\ngrowth, an infinite variety is introduced, among trees of one order, by\r\nthe slight differences in the distribution and constitution of the\r\nleaves themselves. In the Musaceæ, or Scytamineæ, the Bananas, another\r\norder of the same class of plants, a diversity equally remarkable is\r\nproduced in the same way, namely, by slight modifications of this\r\nfundamental law. What can differ more in appearance than the common\r\nBanana (Musa paradisiaca), with its large simple leaves, so loosely\r\narranged around the stem, so graceful and easy in their movements, and\r\nthe Banana of Madagascar (Ravenala madagascariensis), commonly known as\r\nthe Traveller’s tree, which, like the Baccába of Pará, has its leaves\r\nalternating regularly on opposite sides of the trunk, and so closely\r\npacked together as to form an immense flat fan on a colossal stem? Yet,\r\nin all these plants the arrangement of leaves obeys the same law, which\r\nis illustrated with equal distinctness by each one. This mathematical\r\ndisposition of leaves is thus shown to be compatible with a great\r\nvariety of essentially different structures; and though the law of\r\nPhyllotaxis prevails in all plants, being limited neither to class,\r\norders, families, genera, nor species, but running in various\r\ncombinations through the whole kingdom, I believe it can be studied to\r\nespecial advantage in the group of palms, on account of the prominence\r\nof their few large leaves. The most abundant and characteristic palms of\r\nthe Rio Negro are the Javari (Astrocaryum Javari), the Muru-Muru\r\n(Astrocaryum Murumuru), the Uauassu (Attalea speciosa), the Inaja\r\n(Maximiliana regia), the Baccába (Œnocarpus Baccába), the Paxiuba\r\n(Iriartea exorhiza), the Carana (Mauritia Carana), the Caranai (Mauritia\r\nhorrida), the Ubim (Geonoma), and the Curua (Attalea spectabilis); of\r\nthese the two latter are the most useful. The remarkable Piassaba\r\n(Leopoldinia Piassaba) occurs only far above the junction of the Rio\r\nNegro and Rio Branco. We obtained, however, a specimen that had been\r\nplanted at Itatiassu. The many small kinds of Ubim (Geonoma), and Maraja\r\n(Bactris), and even the Jara (Leopoldinia), are so completely\r\novershadowed by the larger trees that they are only noticed where\r\nclustered along the river-banks. Bussus (Manicaria), Assais (Euterpe)\r\nMucaja (Acrocomia), grow also on the Rio Negro, but it remains to be\r\nascertained whether they are specifically identical with those of the\r\nLower Amazons. So peculiar is the aspect of the different species of\r\npalms that, from the deck of the steamer, they can be singled out as\r\neasily as the live-oaks or pecan-nut trees, so readily distinguished on\r\nthe lower course of the Mississippi, or the different kinds of oaks,\r\nbirches, beeches, or walnut-trees which attract observation when sailing\r\nalong the shores of our Northern lakes. It seems, however, impossible to\r\ndiscriminate between all the trees of this wonderful Amazonian forest;\r\npartly because they grow in such heterogeneous associations. In the\r\ntemperate zone we have oak-forests, pine-forests, birch, beech, and\r\nmaple woods, the same kinds of trees congregating together on one soil.\r\nNot so here; there is the most extraordinary diversity in the\r\ncombination of plants, and it is a very rare thing to see the soil\r\noccupied for any extent by the same kind of tree. A large number of the\r\ntrees forming these forests are still unknown to science, and yet the\r\nIndians, those practical botanists and zoölogists, are well acquainted,\r\nnot only with their external appearance, but also with their various\r\nproperties. So intimate is their practical knowledge of the natural\r\nobjects about them, that I believe it would greatly contribute to the\r\nprogress of science if a systematic record were made of all the\r\ninformation thus scattered through the land; an encyclopædia of the\r\nwoods, as it were, taken down from the tribes which inhabit them. I\r\nthink it would be no bad way of collecting, to go from settlement to\r\nsettlement, sending the Indians out to gather all the plants they know,\r\nto dry and label them with the names applied to them in the locality,\r\nand writing out, under the heads of these names, all that may thus be\r\nascertained of their medicinal and otherwise useful properties, as well\r\nas their botanical character. A critical examination of these\r\ncollections would at once correct the information thus obtained,\r\nespecially if the person intrusted with the care of gathering these\r\nmaterials had so much knowledge of botany as would enable him to\r\ncomplete the collections brought in by the Indians, adding to them such\r\nparts as might be wanted for a complete systematic description. The\r\nspecimens ought not to be chosen, however, as they have hitherto been,\r\nsolely with reference to those parts which are absolutely necessary to\r\nidentify the species; the collections, to be complete, ought to include\r\nthe wood, the bark, the roots, and the soft fruits in alcohol. The\r\nabundance and variety of timber in the Amazonian Valley strikes us with\r\namazement. We long to hear the saw-mill busy in these forests, where\r\nthere are several hundred kinds of woods, admirably suited for\r\nconstruction as well as for the finest cabinet-work; remarkable for the\r\nbeauty of their grain, for their hardness, for the variety of their\r\ntints and their veining, and for their durability. And yet so ignorant\r\nare the inhabitants of the value of timber that, when they want a plank,\r\nthey cut down a tree, and chop it to the desired thickness with a\r\nhatchet. There are many other vegetable products, besides those already\r\nexported from the Amazons, which will one day be poured into the market\r\nfrom its fertile shores. The clearest and purest oils are made from some\r\nof the nuts and palm fruits, while many of the palms yield the most\r\nadmirable fibrous material for cordage, singularly elastic and\r\nresistant. Besides its material products,—and of these the greater part\r\nrot on the ground for want of hands to gather them,—the climate and soil\r\nare favorable for the growth of sugar, coffee, cocoa, and cotton; and I\r\nmay add, that the spices of the East might be cultivated in the valley\r\nof the Amazons as well as in the Dutch possessions of Asia.”\r\n\r\n_Sunday, 31st._—Manaos. We had wished exceedingly to extend our\r\nexcursion on the Rio Negro to the mouth of the Rio Branco, but our pilot\r\nwould not undertake to conduct the “Ibicuhy” beyond Pedreira, as he said\r\nthe stones in the bed of the river were numerous and large and the\r\nchannel at this season not very deep. We were, therefore, obliged to\r\nreturn without accomplishing the whole object of this voyage; but though\r\nshort, it was nevertheless most interesting, and has left with us a\r\nvivid impression of the peculiar character of this great stream.\r\nBeautiful as are the endless forests, however, we could not but long,\r\nwhen skirting them day after day without seeing a house or meeting a\r\ncanoe, for the sight of tilled soil, for pasture-lands, for open ground,\r\nfor wheat-fields and haystacks,—for any sign, in short, of the presence\r\nof man. As we sat at night in the stern of the vessel, looking up this\r\nvast river, stretching many hundred leagues, with its solitary,\r\nuninhabited shores and impenetrable forests, it was difficult to resist\r\nan oppressive sense of loneliness. Though here and there an Indian\r\nsettlement or a Brazilian village breaks the distance, yet the\r\npopulation is a mere handful in such a territory. I suppose the time\r\nwill come when the world will claim it, when this river, where, in a six\r\ndays’ journey, we have passed but two or three canoes, will have its\r\nsteamers and vessels of all sorts going up and down, and its banks will\r\nbe busy with life; but the day is not yet. When I remember the poor\r\npeople I have seen in the watch-making and lace-making villages of\r\nSwitzerland, hardly lifting their eyes off their work from break of day\r\ntill night, and even then earning barely enough to keep them above\r\nactual want, and think how easily everything grows here, on land to be\r\nhad for almost nothing, it seems a pity that some parts of the world\r\nshould be so overstocked that there is not nourishment for all, and\r\nothers so empty that there are none to gather the harvest. We long to\r\nsee a vigorous emigration pour into this region so favored by Nature, so\r\nbare of inhabitants. But things go slowly in these latitudes; great\r\ncities do not spring up in half a century, as with us. Humboldt, in his\r\naccount of his South-American journey, writes: “Since my departure from\r\nthe banks of the Orinoco and the Amazon, a new era has unfolded itself\r\nin the social state of the nations of the West. The fury of civil\r\ndissensions has been succeeded by the blessings of peace, and a freer\r\ndevelopment of the arts of industry. The bifurcations of the Orinoco,\r\nthe isthmus of Tuamini, so easy to be made passable by an artificial\r\ncanal, will erelong fix the attention of commercial Europe. The\r\nCassiquiare, as broad as the Rhine, and the course of which is one\r\nhundred and eighty miles in length, will no longer form uselessly a\r\nnavigable canal between two basins of rivers which have a surface of one\r\nhundred and ninety thousand square leagues. The grain of New Granada\r\nwill be carried to the banks of the Rio Negro; boats will descend from\r\nthe sources of the Napo and the Ucuyale, from the Andes of Quito and of\r\nUpper Peru, to the mouths of the Orinoco,—a distance which equals that\r\nfrom Timbuctoo to Marseilles.” Such were the anticipations of Humboldt\r\nmore than sixty years ago; and at this day the banks of the Rio Negro\r\nand the Cassiquiare are still as luxuriant and as desolate, as fertile\r\nand as uninhabited, as they were then.\r\n\r\n_January 8th._—Manaos. The necessity for some days of rest, after so\r\nmany months of unintermitted work, has detained Mr. Agassiz here for a\r\nweek. It has given us an opportunity of renewing our walks in the\r\nneighborhood of Manaos, of completing our collection of plants, and also\r\nof refreshing our memory of scenes which we shall probably never see\r\nagain, and among which we have had a pleasant home for nearly three\r\nmonths. The woods are much more full of flowers than they were when I\r\nfirst became acquainted with their many pleasant paths. Passion-flowers\r\nare especially abundant. There is one kind which has a delicious\r\nperfume, not unlike Cape Jessamine. It hides itself away in the shade,\r\nbut its fragrance betrays it; and if you put aside the branches of the\r\ntrees, you are sure to find its large white-and-purple flowers, and\r\ndark, thick-leaved vine, climbing up some neighboring trunk. Another,\r\nwhich seems rather to court than avoid observation, is of a bright red;\r\nand its crimson stars are often seen set, as it were, in the thick\r\nfoliage of the forest. But, much as I enjoy the verdure here, I\r\nappreciate, more than ever before, the marked passage of the seasons in\r\nour Northern hemisphere. In this unchanging, green world, which never\r\nalters from century to century, except by a little more or less\r\nmoisture, a little more or less heat, I think with the deepest gratitude\r\nof winter and spring, summer and autumn. The circle of nature seems\r\nincomplete, and even the rigors of our climate are remembered with\r\naffection in this continual vapor-bath. It is literally true that you\r\ncannot move ten steps without being drenched in perspiration. However,\r\nthis character of the heat prevents it from being scorching; and we have\r\nno reason to change our first impression, that, on the whole, the\r\nclimate is much less oppressive than we expected to find it, and the\r\nnights are invariably cool.\r\n\r\nAt the end of this week we resume our voyage on board the “Ibicuhy,”\r\ngoing slowly down to Pará, stopping at several points on the way. Our\r\nfirst station will be at Villa Bella, where Mr. Agassiz wishes to make\r\nanother collection of fishes. It may seem strange that, after having\r\nobtained, nearly five months ago, very large collections from the\r\nAmazons itself at this point, as well as from the lakes in the\r\nneighborhood, he should return to the same locality, instead of choosing\r\nanother region for investigation. Were his object merely or mainly to\r\nbecome acquainted with the endless diversity of fishes he now knows to\r\nexist in this immense fresh-water basin, such a repetition of specimens\r\nfrom the same locality would certainly be superfluous, since it is\r\nprobable that a different point would be more prolific in new species.\r\nThe mere accumulation of species is, however, entirely subordinate to\r\nthe object which he has kept in view ever since he began his present\r\nresearches, namely, that of ascertaining by direct observation the\r\ngeographical range of the fishes, and determining whether their\r\nmigrations are so frequent and extensive as they are said to be. I make\r\nan extract from Mr. Agassiz’s notes on this subject.\r\n\r\n“I have been frequently told here that the fishes were very nomadic, the\r\nsame place being occupied at different seasons of the year by different\r\nspecies. My own investigations have led me to believe that these reports\r\nare founded on imperfect observations, and that the localization of\r\nspecies is more distinct and permanent in these waters than has been\r\nsupposed; their migrations being, indeed, very limited, consisting\r\nchiefly in rovings from shallower to deeper waters, and from these to\r\nshoals again, at those seasons when the range of the shore in the same\r\nwater-basin is affected by the rise and fall of the river;—that is to\r\nsay, the fishes found at the bottom of a lake covering perhaps a square\r\nmile in extent, when the waters are lowest, will appear near the shores\r\nof the same lake when, at the season of high waters, it extends over a\r\nmuch wider area. In the same way, fishes which gather near the mouth of\r\na rivulet, at the time of low waters, will be found as high as its\r\norigin at the period of high waters; while fishes which inhabit the\r\nlarger igarapés on the sides of the Amazons when they are swollen by the\r\nrise of the river, may be found in the Amazons itself when the stream is\r\nlow. There is not a single fish known to ascend from the sea to the\r\nhigher courses of the Amazons at certain seasons, and to return\r\nregularly to the ocean. There is no fish here corresponding to the\r\nsalmon, for instance, which ascends the streams of Europe and North\r\nAmerica to deposit its spawn in the cool head-waters of the larger\r\nrivers, and then returns to the sea. The wanderings of the Amazonian\r\nfishes are rather a result of the alternate widening and contracting of\r\ntheir range by the rise and fall of the waters, than of a migratory\r\nhabit; and may be compared to the movements of those oceanic fishes\r\nwhich, at certain seasons, seek the shoals near the shore, while they\r\nspend the rest of the year in deeper waters.\r\n\r\n“Take our shad as an example. It is caught on the coast of Georgia in\r\nFebruary, on the Carolina shores a little later; in March it may be\r\nfound in Washington and Baltimore, next in Philadelphia and New York;\r\nand it does not make its appearance in the Boston market (except when\r\nbrought from farther south) before the latter part of April, or the\r\nbeginning of May. This sequence has led to the belief that the shad\r\nmigrates from Georgia to New England. An examination of the condition of\r\nthese fishes, during the months when they are sold in our markets, shows\r\nat once that this cannot be the case. They are always full of roe, and,\r\nbeing valued for the table at this period, they are brought to market at\r\neach locality until the spawning season is over. Now, as they cannot\r\nbreed twice within a few weeks, it is evident that the shad which make\r\ntheir appearance successively along the Atlantic coast from February to\r\nMay are not the same. It is the spring which migrates northward, calling\r\nup the shoals of shad from the deeper sea, as it touches in succession\r\ndifferent points along the shore. Such movements, if thus connected with\r\nthe advancing spring along a whole coast, appear to be migrations from\r\nsouth to north, when they are, in fact, only the successive rising of\r\nthe same species from deeper to shallower waters at the breeding season.\r\nIn the same way it is probable that the inequality in the seasons of\r\nrise and fall, between the different tributaries of the Amazons and the\r\nvarious parts of its own course, may give a sequence to the appearance\r\nof the fish in certain localities, which seems like migration without\r\nbeing so, in fact.\r\n\r\n“Keeping in view all the information I could obtain upon this subject, I\r\nhave attempted, wherever it was possible to do so, to make collections\r\nsimultaneously at different points of the Amazons: thus, while I was\r\ncollecting at Villa Bella six months ago, some of my assistants were\r\nengaged in the same way at Santarem, and higher up on the Tapajoz; while\r\nI was working at Teffé, parties were busy in the Hyavary, the Iça, and\r\nthe Hyutahy; and during my last stay at Manaos, parties have been\r\ncollecting at Cudajas and at Manacaparu, and higher up on the Rio Negro,\r\nas well as at some lower points on the main river. At some of these\r\nstations I have been able to repeat my investigations at different\r\nseasons, though the intervals between the earlier and later collections\r\nmade at the same localities have, of course, not been the same. Between\r\nthe first collections made at Teffé and the last, hardly two months\r\nintervened, while those made on our first arrival at Manaos in September\r\nup to the present time cover an interval of four months; from the first\r\nto the last at Villa Bella more than five months will have elapsed. On\r\nthis account I attach great importance to the renewal of my\r\ninvestigations at that place, as well as to the later collections from\r\nObydos, Santarem, Monte Alegre, Porto do Moz, Gurupá, Tajapurú, and\r\nPará. As far as these comparisons have gone, they show that the distinct\r\nfaunæ of the above-named localities are not the result of migrations;\r\nfor not only have different fishes been found in all these basins at the\r\nsame time, but at different times the same fishes have been found to\r\nrecur in the same basins, whenever the fishing was carried on, not\r\nmerely in favored localities, but as far as possible over the whole area\r\nindiscriminately, in deep and shoal waters. Should it prove that at\r\nPará, as well as at the intervening stations, after an interval of six\r\nmonths, the fishes are throughout the same as when we ascended the\r\nriver, the evidence against the supposed extensive migrations of the\r\nAmazonian fishes will certainly be very strong. The striking limitation\r\nof species within definite areas does not, however, exclude the presence\r\nof certain kinds of fish simultaneously throughout the whole Amazonian\r\nbasin. The Pirarucu, for instance, is found everywhere from Peru to\r\nPará; and so are a few other species more or less extensively\r\ndistributed over what may be considered distinct ichthyological faunæ.\r\nBut these wide-spread species are not migratory; they have normally and\r\npermanently a wide range, just as some terrestrial animals have an\r\nalmost cosmopolite character, while others are circumscribed within\r\ncomparatively narrow limits. Though most quadrupeds of the United\r\nStates, for instance, differ from those of Mexico and Brazil,\r\nconstituting several distinct faunæ, there is one, the puma or red lion,\r\nthe panther of the North, which is found on the east of the Rocky\r\nMountains and the Andes, from Patagonia to Canada.\r\n\r\n“The movement of the waters, which affects so powerfully the\r\ndistribution of the fishes, forms in itself a very curious phenomenon.\r\nThere is, as it were, a rhythmical correspondence in the rise and fall\r\nof the affluents on either shore of the Amazons, causing the great body\r\nof the water, in its semiannual tides, to sway alternately more to the\r\nnorth or to the south. On the southern side of the valley, the rains\r\nbegin in the months of September and October. They pour down from the\r\ntable-lands of Brazil and the mountains of Bolivia with cumulative\r\nforce, gathering strength as the rainy season progresses, swelling the\r\nhead-waters of the Purus, Madeira, Tapajoz, and other southern\r\ntributaries, and gradually descending to the main stream. The process is\r\na slow one, however, and the full force of the new flood is not felt in\r\nthe Amazons until February and March. During the month of March, in the\r\nregion below the confluence of the Madeira, for instance, the rise of\r\nthe Amazons averages a foot in twenty-four hours, so great is the\r\nquantity of water poured into it. At about the same period with the\r\nsouthern rains, or a little earlier, say in the months of August and\r\nSeptember, the snows in the Andes begin to melt and flow down towards\r\nthe plain. This contribution from the Cordilleras of Peru and Equador,\r\ncoinciding with that from the highlands of Brazil and Bolivia, swells\r\nthe Amazons in its centre and on its southern side to such an extent\r\nthat the bulk of the water pushes northward, crowding upon its northern\r\nshore, and flowing even into the tributaries which open on that side of\r\nthe river, and are now at their lowest ebb. Presently, however, the\r\nrains on the table-lands of Guiana, and on the northern spurs of the\r\nAndes, where the rainy season prevails chiefly in February and March,\r\nrepeat the same process in their turn. During April and May the northern\r\ntributaries are rising, and they reach their maximum in June. Thus, at\r\nthe end of June, when the southern rivers have already fallen\r\nconsiderably, the northern rivers are at their flood-tide. The Rio\r\nNegro, for instance, rises at Manaos to about forty-five feet above its\r\nlowest level. This mass of water from the north now presses against that\r\nin the centre, and bears it southward again. The rainy season along the\r\ncourse of the Amazons is from December till March, corresponding very\r\nnearly, in the time of the year and in duration, with our winter. It\r\nmust be remembered that the valley of the Amazons is not a valley in the\r\nordinary sense, bordered by walls or banks enclosing the waters which\r\nflow between. It is, on the contrary, a plain some seven or eight\r\nhundred miles wide and between two and three thousand miles long, with a\r\nslope so slight that it hardly averages more than a foot in ten miles.\r\nBetween Obydos and the sea-shore, a distance of about eight hundred\r\nmiles, the fall is only forty-five feet; between Tabatinga and the\r\nsea-shore, a distance of more than two thousand miles in a straight\r\nline, the fall is about two hundred feet. The impression to the eye is,\r\ntherefore, that of an absolute plain; and the flow of the water is so\r\ngentle that, in many parts of the river, it is hardly perceptible.\r\nNevertheless, it has a steady movement eastward, descending the gentle\r\nslope of this wide plain, from the Andes to the sea; this movement,\r\naided by the interflow from the south and north at opposite seasons,\r\npresses the bulk of the water to its northernmost reach during our\r\nwinter months, and to its southernmost limit during our summer months.\r\nIn consequence of this, the bottom of the valley is constantly shifting,\r\nand there is a tendency to form channels from the main river to its\r\ntributaries, such as we have seen to exist between the Solimoens and the\r\nRio Negro,—such as Humboldt mentions between the Hyapura and the\r\nAmazons. Indeed, all these rivers are bound together by an extraordinary\r\nnetwork of channels, forming a succession of natural highways which will\r\nalways make artificial roads, to a great degree, unnecessary. Whenever\r\nthe country is settled, it will be possible to pass from the Purus, for\r\ninstance, to the Madeira, from the Madeira to the Tapajoz, from the\r\nTapajoz to the Xingu, and thence to the Tocantins, without entering the\r\ncourse of the main river. The Indians call these passes ‘_furo_,’\r\nliterally, a bore,—a passage pierced from one river to another.\r\nHereafter, when the interests of commerce claim this fertile, overflowed\r\nregion, these channels will be of immense advantage for\r\nintercommunication.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XII.\r\n         DESCENDING THE RIVER TO PARÁ.—EXCURSIONS ON THE COAST.\r\n\r\n  FAREWELL VISIT TO THE GREAT CASCADE AT MANAOS.—CHANGE\r\n    IN ITS ASPECT.—ARRIVAL AT VILLA BELLA.—RETURN TO THE\r\n    HOUSE OF THE FISHERMAN MAIA.—EXCURSION TO THE LAGO\r\n    MAXIMO.—QUANTITY OF GAME AND WATERFOWL.—VICTORIA REGIA.—LEAVE\r\n    VILLA BELLA.—ARRIVE AT OBYDOS.—ITS SITUATION AND\r\n    GEOLOGY.—SANTAREM.—VISIT TO THE CHURCH.—ANECDOTE OF\r\n    MARTIUS.—A ROW OVERLAND.—MONTE ALÉGRE.—PICTURESQUE\r\n    SCENERY.—“BANHEIRAS.”—EXCURSION INTO THE COUNTRY.—LEAVE MONTE\r\n    ALÉGRE.—ANECDOTE OF INDIANS.—ALMEYRIM.—NEW GEOLOGICAL FACTS.—PORTO\r\n    DO MOZ.—COLLECTIONS.—GURUPÁ.—TAJAPURÚ.—ARRIVE AT PARÁ.—RELIGIOUS\r\n    PROCESSION.—EXCURSION TO MARAJO.—SOURÉS.—JESUIT MISSIONS.—GEOLOGY\r\n    OF MARAJO.—BURIED FOREST.—VIGIA.—IGARAPÉ.—VEGETATION AND ANIMAL\r\n    LIFE.—GEOLOGY.—RETURN TO PARÁ.—PHOTOGRAPHING PLANTS.—EXTRACT FROM\r\n    MR. AGASSIZ’S NOTES ON THE VEGETATION OF THE AMAZONS.—PREVALENCE\r\n    OF LEPROSY.\r\n\r\n\r\n_January 15th._—To-day finds us on our way down the Amazons in the\r\n“Ibicuhy.” The day before leaving Manaos we paid a last visit to the\r\ngreat cascade, bathed once more in its cool, delicious waters, and\r\nbreakfasted by the side of the fall. Before many weeks are over, the\r\ncascade will have disappeared; it will be drowned out, as it were, for\r\nthe igarapé is filling rapidly with the rise of the river, and will soon\r\nreach the level of the sandstone shelf over which the water is\r\nprecipitated. Already the appearance of the spot is greatly changed\r\nsince we were there before. The banks are overflowed; the rocks and logs\r\nwhich stood out from the water are wholly covered; and where there was\r\nonly a brawling stream, so shallow that it hardly afforded depth for the\r\nsmallest canoe, there is now a not insignificant river. Indeed,\r\neverywhere we see signs of the changes wrought by the “enchente.” The\r\nvery texture of the Amazons is changed; it is thicker and yellower than\r\nwhen we ascended it, and much more laden with floating wood, detached\r\ngrasses, and _débris_ of all sorts washed from the shore. Wild-flowers\r\nare also more abundant than they were when we came up the river in\r\nSeptember; not delicate, small plants, growing low among moss and grass,\r\nas do our violets, anemones, and the like; but large blossoms, covering\r\ntall trees, and resembling exotics at home, by their rich color and\r\npowerful odor. Indeed, the flowers of the Amazonian forests always\r\nremind me of hot-house plants: and there often comes a warm breath from\r\nthe depths of the woods, laden with moisture and perfume, like the air\r\nfrom the open door of a conservatory.\r\n\r\n_January 17th._—We reached Villa Bella at eight o’clock yesterday\r\nmorning, but waited there only a few hours to make certain necessary\r\narrangements, and then kept on to the mouth of the river Ramos, an\r\nhour’s sail from the town,—the same river which we had ascended from its\r\nupper point of juncture with the Amazons, on our excursion to Mauhes. We\r\nanchored at a short distance from the entrance, before the house of our\r\nold acquaintances, the Maias, where, it may be remembered, we passed a\r\nfew days when collecting in this neighborhood before. Fortunately, Maia\r\nhimself was in Manaos when we left, employed as a soldier in the\r\nNational Guard; and the President kindly gave him leave to accompany us,\r\nthat Mr. Agassiz might have the advantage of his familiarity with the\r\nlocality, and his experience in fishing. The man himself was pleased to\r\nhave an opportunity of visiting his family, to whom his coming was an\r\nagreeable surprise. We went on shore this morning to make them a visit,\r\ntaking with us some little souvenirs, such as beads, trinkets, knives,\r\n&c. We were received as old friends, and made welcome to all the house\r\nwould afford; but, though as clean as ever, it looked poorer than on our\r\nformer visit. I saw neither dried fish nor mandioca nor farinha, and the\r\nwoman told me that she found it very hard to support her large family,\r\nnow that the husband and father was away.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of detached grass, shrubs, &c. carried past the vessel, as\r\nwe lie here at anchor, is amazing,—floating gardens, sometimes half an\r\nacre in extent. Some of these green rafts are inhabited; water-birds go\r\nsailing by upon them, and large animals are occasionally carried down\r\nthe river in this way. The commander told me that, on one occasion, when\r\nan English vessel was lying at anchor in the Parana, one of these grassy\r\ngardens was seen coming down the river with two deer upon it. The\r\ncurrent brought it directly against the ship, and the captain had only\r\nto receive on board the guests who arrived thus unexpectedly to demand\r\nhis hospitality. In the same river another floating island brought with\r\nit a less agreeable inhabitant: a large tiger had possessed himself of\r\nit and was sailing majestically with the current, passing so near the\r\nshores that he was distinctly seen from the banks; and people went out\r\nin montarias to get a nearer view of him, though keeping always at a\r\nrespectful distance. The most conspicuous of the plants thus detached\r\nfrom the shore are the Canarana (a kind of wild cane), a variety of\r\naquatic Aroides, Pistia among the number, Ecornia, and a quantity of\r\ngraceful floating Marsileaceæ.\r\n\r\n_January 18th._—To-day we have been on a hunt after the Victoria regia.\r\nWe have made constant efforts to see this famous lily growing in its\r\nnative waters; but, though frequently told that it was plenty at certain\r\nseasons in the lakes and igarapés, we have never been able to find it.\r\nYesterday some of the officers of the ship, who had been on an excursion\r\nto a neighboring lake, returned laden with botanical treasures of all\r\nsorts, and, among other plants, an immense lily-leaf, which, from its\r\ndimensions, we judged must be the Victoria regia, though it had not the\r\nerect edge so characteristic of it. This morning, accompanied by two or\r\nthree of yesterday’s party, who kindly undertook to be our guides, we\r\nwent to visit the same lake. A short walk from the river-bank brought us\r\nto the shore of a large sheet of water,—the Lago Maximo,—which connects\r\nwith the Ramos by a narrow outlet, but at a point so distant from our\r\nanchorage that it would have been necessary to make a great detour in\r\norder to reach it in a canoe. We found an old montaria, with one or two\r\nbroken paddles, left, as it seemed, at the lake-shore for whom it might\r\nconcern, and in that we embarked at once. The banks of this lake are\r\nbordered with beautiful forests, which do not, however, rise immediately\r\nfrom the water, but are divided from it by a broad band of grass. We saw\r\nmany water-birds on this grassy edge, as well as on several dead trees,\r\nthe branches of which were completely covered with gulls, all in exactly\r\nthe same attitude, facing one way, to meet the wind which blew strongly\r\nagainst them. Ducks and ciganas were plenty; and once or twice we\r\nstartled up from the woods small flocks of mackaws,—not only the gaudy\r\nred, green, and yellow species, but the far more beautiful blue mackaw.\r\nThey flew by us, with their gorgeous plumage glittering in the sun, and\r\ndisappeared again among the trees, seeking deeper and more undisturbed\r\nretreats. From the reedy grasses came also the deep note of the unicorn,\r\nso greatly prized in Brazil,—a large bird, half wader, half fowl,\r\nbelonging to the genus Palamedea; but as we were only prepared for a\r\nbotanizing expedition, we could not avail ourselves of any of the\r\nopportunities thus offered; and the birds, however near and tempting the\r\nshots, had little to fear from us. At the upper end of the lake we came\r\nupon the bed of water-lilies from which the trophies of yesterday had\r\nbeen gathered. The leaves were very large, many of them from four to\r\nfive feet in diameter; but, perhaps from having lost their first\r\nfreshness and something therefore of their natural texture, the edge of\r\nthe leaf was scarcely perceptibly raised, and in most instances lay\r\nperfectly flat upon the water. We found buds, but no perfect flower. In\r\nthe afternoon, however, one of the daughters of our fisherman Maia,\r\nhearing that we wished to see one of the flowers, brought us a very\r\nperfect specimen from another more distant locality, which we had not\r\ntime to visit. The Indians, by the way, have a characteristic name for\r\nthe leaf. They call it “forno,” on account of its resemblance to the\r\nimmense shallow pans in which they bake their farinha over the mandioca\r\novens. The Victoria regia, with its formidable armor of spines, its\r\ngigantic leaves, and beautiful flowers, deepening in color from the\r\nvelvety white outer leaves through every shade of rose to deepest\r\ncrimson, and fading again to a creamy, yellowish tint in the heart of\r\nthe flower, has been described so often that I hardly dare dwell upon\r\nit, for fear of wearying the reader. And yet we could not see it growing\r\nin its native waters—a type, as it were, of the luxuriance of tropical\r\nnature—without the deepest interest. Wonderful as it is when seen in the\r\ntank of a greenhouse, and perhaps even more impressive, in a certain\r\nsense, from its isolation, in its own home it has the charm of harmony\r\nwith all that surrounds it,—with the dense mass of forest, with palm and\r\nparasite, with birds of glowing plumage, with insects of all bright and\r\nwonderful tints, and with fishes which, though hidden in the water\r\nbeneath it, are not less brilliant and varied than the world of life\r\nabove. I do not remember to have seen an allusion, in any description,\r\nto the beautiful device by which the whole immense surface of the adult\r\nleaf is contained within the smaller dimensions of the young one; though\r\nit is well worth notice, as one of the neatest specimens of Nature’s\r\npacking. All know the heavy scaffolding of ribs by which the colossal\r\nleaf, when full grown, is supported on its under side. In the young leaf\r\nthese ribs are comparatively small, but the whole green expanse of the\r\nadult leaf is gathered in between them in regular rows of delicate\r\npuffings. At this period, the leaf is far below the surface of the\r\nwater, growing slowly up from the base of the stock from which it\r\nsprings. Thus drawn up, it has the form of a deep cup or vase; but in\r\nproportion as the ribs grow, their ramifications stretching in every\r\ndirection, the leaf lets out one by one its little folds, to fill the\r\never-widening spaces; till at last, when it reaches the surface of the\r\nwater, it rests horizontally above it, without a wrinkle. Mr. Agassiz\r\ncaused several stocks to be dragged up from the bottom (no easy matter,\r\non account of the spines), and found the leaf-buds just starting between\r\nthe roots,—little white caps, not more than half an inch in height.\r\nThere was another lily growing in this lake, which, though diminutive by\r\nthe side of the Victoria, would be a giant among our water-lilies. The\r\nleaf measured more than a foot in diameter, and was slightly scolloped\r\naround the edge. There were no open flowers, but the closed buds\r\nresembled those of our common white water-lilies, and were no larger.\r\nThe stalk and ribs, unlike those of the Victoria, were quite smooth, and\r\nfree from thorns. After our visit to the lilies, we paddled in among the\r\ntrees along the overflowed margin of the lake, in order that the boatmen\r\nmight cut down several palms new to us. While waiting under the trees in\r\nthe boat, we had cause to admire the variety and beauty of the insects\r\nfluttering about us; the large blue butterflies (Morpho), and the\r\nbrilliant dragon-flies, with crimson bodies and burnished wings,\r\nglittering with metallic lustre.[88]\r\n\r\n_January 21st._—Obydos. We left Villa Bella yesterday with a large\r\ncollection of fishes, and some valuable additions to the collection of\r\npalms. The general character of the fish collections, both from the\r\nriver Ramos and the Lago Maximo, shows the faunæ to be the same now as\r\nwhen we were here five months ago. Certainly, during this interval,\r\nmigration has had no perceptible influence upon the distribution of life\r\nin these waters. Leaving Villa Bella at night, we reached Obydos early\r\nthis morning. This pretty town is one of the most picturesque in\r\nposition, on the Amazons. It stands on a steep bluff, commanding an\r\nextensive view of the river west and east, and is one of the few points\r\nat which the southern and northern shores are seen at the same time. The\r\nbluff of Obydos is crowned by a fortress, which has stood here for many\r\nyears without occasion to test its power. It may be doubted whether it\r\nwould be very effectual in barring the river against a hostile force,\r\ninasmuch as its guns, though they carry perfectly well to the opposite\r\nside, are powerless nearer home. The slope of the cliff on which the\r\nfortress stands intervenes between it and the water below, so that by\r\nkeeping well in to shore the enemy could pass with impunity immediately\r\nunder the guns. The hill consists entirely of the same red drift so\r\nconstantly recurring on the banks of the Amazons and its tributaries.\r\nHere it is more full of pebbles than at Manaos or at Teffé; and we saw\r\nthese pebbles disposed in lines or horizontal beds, such as are found in\r\nthe same deposit along the coast and in the neighborhood of Rio. The\r\ncity of Obydos is prettily laid out, its environs are very picturesque,\r\nits soil extremely fertile; but it has the same aspect of neglect and\r\nhopeless inactivity so painfully striking in all the Amazonian towns.\r\n\r\n_January 23d._ Yesterday, in the early morning, we arrived at Santarem,\r\nand went on shore for a walk at half past seven. The town stands on a\r\npoint of land dividing the black waters of the Tapajoz, on the one side,\r\nfrom the yellow flood of the Amazons on the other, and has a very\r\nattractive situation, enhanced by its background of hills stretching\r\naway to the eastward. Our first visit was to the church, fronting on the\r\nbeach and standing invitingly open. We had, however, a special object in\r\nentering it. In 1819 Martius, the naturalist, on his voyage of\r\nexploration on the Amazons, since made famous by his great work on the\r\nNatural History of Brazil, was wrecked off the town of Santarem, and\r\nnearly lost his life. In his great danger he took a vow to record his\r\ngratitude, should he live, by making a gift to the church of Santarem.\r\nAfter his return to Europe, he sent from Munich a full-length figure of\r\nChrist upon the cross, which now hangs against the wall, with a simple\r\ninscription underneath, telling in a few words the story of his peril,\r\nhis deliverance, and his gratitude. As a work of art it has no special\r\nvalue, but it attracts many persons to the church who never heard of\r\nMartius or his famous journey; and to Mr. Agassiz it was especially\r\ninteresting, as connected with the travels and dangers of his old friend\r\nand teacher.\r\n\r\nAfter a walk through the town, which is built with more care, and\r\ncontains some houses having more pretensions to comfort and elegance\r\nthan we have seen elsewhere on the Amazons, we returned to the ship for\r\nbreakfast. At a later hour we went on a very pleasant canoe excursion to\r\nthe other side of the Tapajoz, again in search of the Victoria regia,\r\nsaid to grow in great perfection in this neighborhood. Our guide was\r\nSenhor Joachim Rodriguez, to whom Mr. Agassiz has been indebted for much\r\npersonal kindness, as well as for a very valuable collection made since\r\nwe stopped here on our way up the river, partly by himself and partly by\r\nhis son, a bright boy of some thirteen years of age. Crossing to the\r\nopposite side of the river, we came upon a vast field of coarse, high\r\ngrass, looking like an extensive meadow. To our surprise, the boatmen\r\nturned the canoe into this green field, and we found ourselves\r\napparently navigating the land, for the narrow boat-path was entirely\r\nconcealed by the long reedy grasses and tall mallow-plants with large\r\npink blossoms rising on either side, and completely hiding the water\r\nbelow. This marshy, overflowed ground, above which the water had a depth\r\nof from four to six feet, was full of life. As the rowers pushed our\r\ncanoe through the mass of grass and flowers, Mr. Agassiz gathered from\r\nthe blades and stalks all sorts of creatures; small bright-colored toads\r\nof several kinds, grasshoppers, beetles, dragon-flies, aquatic snails,\r\nbunches of eggs,—in short, an endless variety of living things, most\r\ninteresting to the naturalist. The harvest was so plentiful that we had\r\nonly to put out our hands and gather it; the oarsmen, when they saw Mr.\r\nAgassiz’s enthusiasm, became almost as interested as he was; and he had\r\nsoon a large jar filled with objects quite new to him. After navigating\r\nthese meadows for some time, we came upon open water-spaces where the\r\nVictoria regia was growing in great perfection. The specimens were much\r\nfiner than those we had seen before in the Lago Maximo. One leaf\r\nmeasured five feet and a half in diameter, and another five feet, the\r\nerect edge being three inches and a half in height. A number of leaves\r\ngrew from the same stalk; and seen thus together they are very\r\nbeautiful, the bright rose-color of the outer edge contrasting with the\r\nvivid green of the inner surface of the leaf. As before, there were no\r\nopen flowers to be seen; Senhor Rodriguez told us that they are cut by\r\nthe fishermen almost as soon as they open. When Mr. Agassiz expressed a\r\nwish to get the roots, two of our boatmen plunged into the water with an\r\nalacrity which surprised me, as we had just been told that these marshes\r\nare the haunts of Jacarés. They took turns in diving to dig up the\r\nplants, and succeeded in bringing to the surface three large stalks, one\r\nwith a flower-bud. We returned well pleased with our row overland.\r\n\r\nOur live-stock is increasing as we descend the river, and we have now\r\nquite a menagerie on board; a number of parrots, half a dozen monkeys,\r\ntwo exquisite little deer from the region of Monte Alégre, and several\r\nAgamis, as tame and gentle as barn-yard fowls, stepping about the deck\r\nwith graceful, dainty tread, and feeding from the hand. Their voices are\r\nsingularly harsh, however, and out of keeping with their pretty looks\r\nand ways. Every now and then they raise their heads, stretch their long\r\nnecks, and utter a loud, gurgling sound, more like the roll of a drum\r\nthan the note of a bird. Last, but not least, we have a sloth on board,\r\nthe most fascinating of all our pets to me, not certainly for his\r\ncharms, but for his oddities. I am never tired of watching him, he looks\r\nso deliciously lazy. His head sunk in his arms, his whole attitude lax\r\nand indifferent, he seems to ask only for rest. If you push him, or if,\r\nas often happens, a passer-by gives him a smart tap to arouse him, he\r\nlifts his head and drops his arms so slowly, so deliberately, that they\r\nhardly seem to move, raises his heavy lids and lets his large eyes rest\r\nupon your face for a moment with appealing, hopeless indolence; then the\r\nlids fall softly, the head droops, the arms fold heavily about it, and\r\nhe collapses again into absolute repose. This mute remonstrance is the\r\nnearest approach to activity I have seen him make. These live animals\r\nare not all a part of the scientific collections; many of them belong to\r\nthe captain and officers. The Brazilians are exceedingly fond of pets,\r\nand almost every house has its monkeys, its parrots, and other tame\r\nanimals and birds.\r\n\r\n_January 26th._—Monte Alégre. Leaving Santarem on Tuesday we arrived\r\nhere on Wednesday morning, and, as on our former visit, were received\r\nmost hospitably at the house of Senhor Manuel. Mr. Agassiz and Mr.\r\nCoutinho have gone on a geologizing excursion to the Serra d’Ereré, that\r\npicturesque range of hills bounding the campos, or open sandy plain, to\r\nthe northwest of the town. They took different routes, Major Coutinho,\r\nwith Captain Faria and one or two other friends, crossing the campos on\r\nhorseback, while Mr. Agassiz went by canoe. They will meet at the foot\r\nof the Serra, and pass two or three days in that neighborhood. Little is\r\nas yet known of the geological structure of the Amazonian Serras,—those\r\nof Santarem, of Monte Alégre, and of Almeyrim. Generally they have been\r\nconsidered as prolongations either of the table-land of Guiana on the\r\nnorth, or that of Brazil on the south. Mr. Agassiz believes them to be\r\nindependent of both, and more directly connected with the formation of\r\nthe Amazonian Valley itself. The solution of this question is his\r\nspecial object, while Major Coutinho has taken barometers to determine\r\nthe height of the range. In the mean time, I am passing a few quiet days\r\nhere, learning to be more familiar with the scenery of a region very\r\njustly called one of the most picturesque on the borders of the Amazons.\r\nNot only are the views extensive, but the friable nature of the soil, so\r\neasily decomposed, combined with the heavy rains, has led to the\r\nformation of a variety of picturesque dells and hollows, some of which\r\nhave springs running into them, surrounded by rocky banks and overhung\r\nwith trees. One of these is especially pretty; the excavation is large,\r\nand has the form of an amphitheatre; its rocky walls are crowned with\r\nlarge forest-trees, palms, mimosas, etc., making a deep shade; and at\r\none side the spring flows down from the top of the cliff, with a\r\npleasant ripple. Here the negro or Indian servants come to fill their\r\nwater-jars. They often have with them the children under their charge;\r\nand you may sometimes see the large red jars standing under the mouth of\r\nthe spring above, while white babies and dark nurses splash about in the\r\ncool water-basin below. Although in the campos the growth is low, and\r\nthe soil but scantily covered with coarse grass and shrubs, yet, in some\r\nlocalities, and especially in the neighborhood of the town, the forest\r\nis beautiful. We have seen nowhere larger and more luxuriant mimosas,\r\nsometimes of a green so rich and deep, and a foliage so close that it is\r\ndifficult to believe, at a distance, that its dense mass is formed by\r\nthe light, pinnate leaves of a sensitive plant. The palms are also very\r\nlofty and numerous, including some kinds which we have not met before.\r\n\r\n_January 28th._—Yesterday our kind host arranged an excursion into the\r\ncountry, for my especial pleasure, that I might see something of the\r\ncharacteristic amusements of Monte Alégre. One or two neighbors joined\r\nus, and the children, a host of happy little folks, for whom anything\r\nout of the common tenor of every-day life is “_festa_,” were not left\r\nbehind. We started on foot to walk out into a very picturesque Indian\r\nvillage called Surubiju. Here we were to breakfast, returning afterwards\r\nin one of the heavy carts drawn by oxen, the only conveyance for women\r\nand children in a country where a carriage-road and a side-saddle are\r\nequally unknown. Our walk was very pleasant, partly through the woods,\r\npartly through the campos; but as it was early in the day, we did not\r\nmiss the shade when we chanced to leave the trees. We lingered by the\r\nwayside, the children stopping to gather wild fruits, of which there\r\nwere a number on the road, and to help me in making a collection of\r\nplants. It was about nine o’clock when we reached the first straw-house,\r\nwhere we stopped to rest. Though it has no longer the charm of novelty\r\nfor me, I am always glad to visit an Indian cottage. You find a cordial\r\nwelcome; the best hammock, the coolest corner, and a _cuia_ of fresh\r\nwater are ready for you. As a general thing, the houses of the Indians\r\nare also more tidy than those of the whites; and there is a certain\r\ncharm of picturesqueness about them which never wears off.\r\n\r\nAfter a short rest, we went on through the settlement, where the sitios\r\nare scattered at considerable distances, and so completely surrounded by\r\ntrees that they seem quite isolated in the forest. Although the Indians\r\nare said to be a lazy people, and are unquestionably fitful and\r\nirregular in their habits of work, in almost all these houses some\r\ncharacteristic occupation was going on. In two or three the women were\r\nmaking hammocks, in one a boy was plaiting the leaves of the Curua palm\r\ninto a tolda for his canoe, in another the inmates were making a coarse\r\nkind of pottery; and in still another a woman, who is quite famous in\r\nthe neighborhood for her skill in the art, was painting cuias. It was\r\nthe first time I had seen the prepared colors made from a certain kind\r\nof clay found in the Serra. It is just the carnival season, and, as\r\nevery one has a right to play pranks on his neighbors, we did not get\r\noff without making a closer acquaintance than was altogether pleasant\r\nwith the rustic artist’s colors. As we were leaving the cottage, she\r\ndarted out upon us, her hands full of blue and red paints. If they had\r\nbeen tomahawks, they could not have produced a more sudden rout; and it\r\nwas a complete _sauve qui peut_ of the whole company across the little\r\nbridge which led to the house. As a stranger, I was spared; but all were\r\nnot fortunate enough to escape, and some of the children carried their\r\nblue and red badges to the end of the day.\r\n\r\nThe prettiest of all these forest sitios was one at the bottom of a deep\r\ndell, reached by a steep, winding path through a magnificent wood\r\nabounding in palms. But though the situation was most picturesque, the\r\nsickly appearance of the children and the accounts of prevailing illness\r\nshowed that the locality was too low and damp to be healthful. After a\r\nvery pleasant ramble we returned to breakfast at our first\r\nresting-place, and at about one o’clock started for town in two ox-carts\r\nwhich had come out to meet us. They consist only of a floor set on very\r\nheavy, creaking wooden wheels, which, from their primitive, clumsy\r\ncharacter, would seem to be the first wheels ever invented. On the floor\r\na straw-mat was spread, an awning was stretched over a light scaffolding\r\nabove, and we were soon stowed away in our primitive vehicle, and had a\r\nvery gay and pleasant ride back to town. Yesterday evening Mr. Agassiz\r\nreturned from his excursion to the Serra Ereré. I add here a little\r\naccount of the journey, written out from his notes, and containing some\r\nremarks on the general aspect of the country, its vegetation and\r\nanimals. A summary of the geological results of the excursion will be\r\nfound in a separate chapter at the close of our Amazonian journey.\r\n\r\n“I started before daylight; but as the dawn began to redden the sky\r\nlarge flocks of ducks, and of the small Amazonian goose, might be seen\r\nflying towards the lakes. Here and there a cormorant sat alone on the\r\nbranch of a dead tree, or a kingfisher poised himself over the water,\r\nwatching for his prey. Numerous gulls were gathered in large companies\r\non the trees along the river-shore; alligators lay on its surface,\r\ndiving with a sudden plash at the approach of our canoe; and\r\noccasionally a porpoise emerged from the water, showing himself for a\r\nmoment and then disappearing again. Sometimes we startled a herd of\r\ncapivaras, resting on the water’s edge; and once we saw a sloth, sitting\r\nupon the branch of an Imbauba tree (Cecropia), rolled up in its peculiar\r\nattitude, the very picture of indolence, with its head sunk between its\r\narms. Much of the river-shore consisted of low, alluvial land, and was\r\ncovered with that peculiar and beautiful grass known as Capim; this\r\ngrass makes an excellent pasturage for cattle, and the abundance of it\r\nin this region renders the district of Monte Alégre very favorable for\r\nagricultural purposes. Here and there, where the red-clay soil rose\r\nabove the level of the water, a palm-thatched cabin stood on the low\r\nbluff, with a few trees about it. Such a house was usually the centre of\r\na cattle-farm, and large herds might be seen grazing in the adjoining\r\nfields. Along the river-banks, where the country is chiefly open, with\r\nextensive low, marshy grounds, the only palm to be seen is the Maraja\r\n(Geonoma). After keeping along the Rio Gurupatuba for some distance, we\r\nturned to the right into a narrow stream, which has the character of an\r\nigarapé in its lower course, though higher up it drains the country\r\nbetween the serra of Ereré and that of Tajury, and assumes the\r\nappearance of a small river. It is named after the serra, and is known\r\nas the Rio Ereré. This stream, narrow and picturesque, and often so\r\novergrown with capim that the canoe pursued its course with difficulty,\r\npassed through a magnificent forest of the beautiful fan-palm, called\r\nthe Miriti (Mauritia flexuosa). This forest stretched for miles,\r\novershadowing, as a kind of underbrush, many smaller trees and\r\ninnumerable shrubs, some of which bore bright, conspicuous flowers. It\r\nseemed to me a strange spectacle,—a forest of monocotyledonous trees\r\nwith a dicotyledonous undergrowth; the inferior plants thus towering\r\nabove and sheltering the superior ones. Among the lower trees were many\r\nLeguminosæ,—one of the most striking, called Fava, having a colossal\r\npod. The whole mass of vegetation was woven together by innumerable\r\nlianas and creeping vines, in the midst of which the flowers of the\r\nBignonia, with its open, trumpet-shaped corolla, were conspicuous. The\r\ncapim was bright with the blossoms of the mallow, growing in its midst;\r\nand was often edged with the broad-leaved Aninga, a large aquatic Arum.\r\n\r\n“Through such a forest, where the animal life was no less rich and\r\nvaried than the vegetation, our boat glided slowly for hours. The number\r\nand variety of birds struck me with astonishment. The coarse, sedgy\r\ngrasses on either side were full of water birds, one of the most common\r\nof which was a small chestnut-brown wading bird, the Jaçana (Parra),\r\nwhose toes are immensely long in proportion to its size, enabling it to\r\nrun upon the surface of the aquatic vegetation, as if it were solid\r\nground. It was now the month of January, their breeding season; and at\r\nevery turn of the boat we started them up in pairs. Their flat, open\r\nnests generally contained five flesh-colored eggs, streaked in zigzag\r\nwith dark brown lines. The other waders were a snow-white heron, another\r\nash-colored, smaller species, and a large white stork. The ash-colored\r\nherons were always in pairs; the white ones always single, standing\r\nquiet and alone on the edge of the water, or half hidden in the green\r\ncapim. The trees and bushes were full of small warbler-like birds, which\r\nit would be difficult to characterize separately. To the ordinary\r\nobserver they might seem like the small birds of our woods; but there\r\nwas one species among them which attracted my attention by its numbers,\r\nand also because it builds the most extraordinary nest, considering the\r\nsize of the bird itself, that I have ever seen. It is known among the\r\ncountry people by two names, as the Pedreiro or the Forneiro; both names\r\nreferring, as will be seen, to the nature of its habitation. This\r\nsingular nest is built of clay, and is as hard as stone (_pedra_), while\r\nit has the form of the round mandioca oven (_forno_) in which the\r\ncountry people prepare their farinha, or flour, made from the mandioca\r\nroot. It is about a foot in diameter, and stands edgewise upon a branch,\r\nor in the crotch of a tree. Among the smaller birds I noticed bright\r\nTanagers, and also a species resembling the Canary. Besides these, there\r\nwere the wagtails; the black and white widow-finches; the hang-nests, or\r\nJapi, as they are called here, with their pendent, bag-like dwellings,\r\nand the familiar “Bem ti vi.” Humming-birds, which we are always apt to\r\nassociate with tropical vegetation, were very scarce. I saw but a few\r\nspecimens. Thrushes and doves were more frequent, and I noticed also\r\nthree or four kinds of woodpeckers, beside parrots and paroquets; of\r\nthese latter there were countless numbers along our canoe path, flying\r\noverhead in dense crowds, and at times drowning every other sound in\r\ntheir high, noisy chatter.\r\n\r\n“Some of these birds made a deep impression upon me. Indeed, in all\r\nregions, however far away from his own home, in the midst of a fauna and\r\nflora entirely new to him, the traveller is startled occasionally by the\r\nsong of a bird or the sight of a flower so familiar that it transports\r\nhim at once to woods where every tree is like a friend to him. It seems\r\nas if something akin to what in our own mental experience we call\r\nreminiscence or association existed in the workings of Nature; for\r\nthough the organic combinations are so distinct in different climates\r\nand countries, they never wholly exclude each other. Every zoölogical\r\nand botanical province retains some link which binds it to all the\r\nothers, and makes it part of the general harmony. The Arctic lichen is\r\nfound growing under the shadow of the palm on the rocks of the tropical\r\nserra; and the song of the thrush and the tap of the woodpecker mingle\r\nwith the sharp, discordant cries of the parrot and paroquet.\r\n\r\n“Birds of prey, also, were not wanting. Among them was one about the\r\nsize of our kite, and called the Red Hawk, which was so tame that, even\r\nwhen our canoe passed immediately under the low branch on which he was\r\nsitting, he did not fly away. But, of all the groups of birds, the most\r\nstriking as compared with corresponding groups in the temperate zone,\r\nand the one which reminded me the most distinctly of the fact that every\r\nregion has its peculiar animal world, was that of the gallinaceous\r\nbirds. The most frequent is the Cigana, to be seen in groups of fifteen\r\nor twenty, perched upon trees overhanging the water, and feeding upon\r\nberries. At night they roost in pairs, but in the daytime are always in\r\nlarger companies. In their appearance they have something of the\r\ncharacter of both the pheasant and peacock, and yet do not closely\r\nresemble either. It is a curious fact, that, with the exception of some\r\nsmall partridge-like gallinaceous birds, all the representatives of this\r\nfamily in Brazil, and especially in the valley of the Amazons, belong to\r\ntypes which do not exist in other parts of the world. Here we find\r\nneither pheasants, nor cocks of the woods, nor grouse; but in their\r\nplace abound the Mutum, the Jacu, the Jacami, and the Unicorn (Crax,\r\nPenelope, Psophia, and Palamedea), all of which are so remote from the\r\ngallinaceous types found farther north that they remind one quite as\r\nmuch of the bustard, and other ostrich-like birds, as of the hen and\r\npheasant. They differ also from northern gallinaceous birds in the\r\ngreater uniformity of the sexes, none of them exhibiting those striking\r\ndifferences between the males and females which we see in the pheasants,\r\nthe cocks of the woods, and in our barn-yard fowls, though the plumage\r\nof the young has the yellowish-mottled color distinguishing the females\r\nof most species of this family. While birds abounded in such numbers,\r\ninsects were rather scarce. I saw but few and small butterflies, and\r\nbeetles were still more rare. The most numerous insects were the\r\ndragon-flies,—some with crimson bodies, black heads, and burnished\r\nwings; others with large green bodies, crossed by blue bands. Of\r\nland-shells I saw but one, creeping along the reeds; and of water-shells\r\nI gathered only a few small Ampullariæ.\r\n\r\n“Having ascended the river to a point nearly on a line with the serra, I\r\nlanded, and struck across the campos on foot. Here I entered upon an\r\nentirely different region,—a dry, open plain, with scanty vegetation.\r\nThe most prominent plants were clusters of Cacti and Curua palms, a kind\r\nof stemless, low palm, with broad, elegant leaves springing vase-like\r\nfrom the ground. In these dry, sandy fields, rising gradually toward the\r\nserra, I observed in the deeper gullies formed by the heavy rains the\r\nlaminated clays which are everywhere the foundation of the Amazonian\r\nstrata. They here presented again so much the character of ordinary\r\nclay-slates that I thought I had at last come upon some old geological\r\nformation. Instead of this I only obtained fresh evidence that, by\r\nbaking them, the burning sun of the tropics may produce upon laminated\r\nclays of recent origin the same effect as plutonic agencies have\r\nproduced upon the ancient clays,—that is, it may change them into\r\nmetamorphic slates. As I approached the serra, I was again reminded how,\r\nunder the most dissimilar circumstances, similar features recur\r\neverywhere in nature. I came suddenly upon a little creek, bordered with\r\nthe usual vegetation of such shallow water-courses, and on its brink\r\nstood a sand-piper, which flew away at my approach, uttering its\r\npeculiar cry, so like what we hear at home that, had I not seen him, I\r\nshould have recognized him by his voice. After an hour’s walk under the\r\nscorching sun, I was glad to find myself at the hamlet of Ereré, near\r\nthe foot of the serra, where I rejoined my companions. This is almost\r\nthe only occasion in all my Amazonian journey when I have passed a day\r\nin the pure enjoyment of nature, without the labor of collecting, which\r\nin this hot climate, where specimens require such immediate and constant\r\nattention, is very great. I learned how rich a single day may be in this\r\nwonderful tropical world, if one’s eyes are only open to the wealth of\r\nanimal and vegetable life. Indeed, a few hours so spent in the field, in\r\nsimply watching animals and plants, teaches more of the distribution of\r\nlife than a month of closet study; for under such circumstances all\r\nthings are seen in their true relations. Unhappily, it is not easy to\r\npresent the picture as a whole; for all our written descriptions are\r\nmore or less dependent on nomenclature, and the local names are hardly\r\nknown out of the districts where they belong, while systematic names are\r\nfamiliar to few.”\r\n\r\n_January 30th._—On board the “Ibicuhy.” Yesterday we parted from our\r\nkind hosts, and bade good by to Monte Alégre. I shall long retain a\r\npicture, half pleasant, half sad, of its shady, picturesque walks and\r\ndells; of its wide green square, with the unfinished cathedral in the\r\ncentre, where trees and vines mantle the open doors and windows, and\r\ngrass grows thick over the unfrequented aisles; of its neglected\r\ncemetery, and the magnificent view it commands over an endless labyrinth\r\nof lakes on one side, beyond which glitter the yellow waters of the\r\nAmazons, while, on the other, the level campos is bordered by the\r\npicturesque heights of the distant Serra. I have never been able to\r\nexplain quite to my own satisfaction the somewhat melancholy impression\r\nwhich this region, lovely as it unquestionably is, made upon me when I\r\nfirst saw it,—an impression not wholly destroyed by a longer residence.\r\nPerhaps it is the general aspect of incompleteness and decay, the\r\nabsence of energy and enterprise, making the lavish gifts of Nature of\r\nno avail. In the midst of a country which should be overflowing with\r\nagricultural products, neither milk, nor butter, nor cheese, nor\r\nvegetables, nor fruit, are to be had. You constantly hear people\r\ncomplaining of the difficulty of procuring even the commonest articles\r\nof domestic consumption, when, in fact, they ought to be produced by\r\nevery land-owner. The agricultural districts in Brazil are rich and\r\nfertile, but there is no agricultural population. The nomad Indian,\r\nfloating about in his canoe, the only home to which he has a genuine\r\nattachment, never striking root in the soil, has no genius for\r\ncultivating the ground. As an illustration of the Indian character, it\r\nmay not be amiss to record an incident which occurred yesterday when we\r\nwere leaving Monte Alégre. On his journey to Ereré, Major Coutinho had\r\nbeen requested by an Indian and his wife, whose acquaintance he had made\r\nin former excursions there, to take one of their boys, a child about\r\neight years of age, with him to Rio. This is very common among the\r\nIndians; they are not unwilling to give up their children, if they can\r\nsecure a maintenance for them, and perhaps some advantages of education\r\nbesides. On the day of departure, the mother and father and two sisters\r\naccompanied the child to the steamer, but I think, as the sequel showed,\r\nrather for the sake of seeing the ship, and having a day of amusement,\r\nthan from any sentiment about parting with the child. When the moment of\r\nseparation came, the mother, with an air of perfect indifference, gave\r\nthe little boy her hand to kiss. The father seemed to be going off\r\nwithout remembering his son at all; but the little fellow ran after him,\r\ntook his hand and kissed it, and then stood crying and broken-hearted on\r\nthe deck, while the whole family put off in the canoe, talking and\r\nlaughing gayly, without showing him the least sympathy. Such traits are\r\nsaid to be very characteristic of the Indians. They are cold in their\r\nfamily affections; and though the mothers are very fond of their babies,\r\nthey seem comparatively indifferent to them as they grow up. It is,\r\nindeed, impossible to rely upon the affection of an Indian, even though\r\nisolated cases of remarkable fidelity have been known among them. But I\r\nhave been told over and over again, by those who have had personal\r\nexperience in the matter, that you may take an Indian child, bring him\r\nup, treat him with every kindness, educate him, clothe him, and find him\r\nto be a useful and seemingly faithful member of the household; one day\r\nhe is gone, you know not where, and in every probability you will never\r\nhear of him again. Theft is not one of their vices. On the contrary,\r\nsuch an Indian, if he deserts the friend who has reared him and taken\r\ncare of him, is very likely to leave behind him all his clothes, except\r\nthose he has on, and any presents he may have received. The only thing\r\nhe may be tempted to take will be a canoe and a pair of oars: with these\r\nan Indian is rich. He only wants to get back to his woods; and he is\r\ndeterred by no sentiment of affection, or consideration of interest.\r\n\r\nTo-day we are passing the hills of Almeyrim. The last time we saw them\r\nit was in the glow of a brilliant sunset; to-day, ragged edges of clouds\r\noverhang them, and they are sombre under a leaden, rainy sky. It is\r\ndelightful to Mr. Agassiz, in returning to this locality, to find that\r\nphenomena, which were a blank to him on our voyage up the river, are\r\nperfectly explicable now that he has had an opportunity of studying the\r\ngeology of the Amazonian Valley. When we passed these singular\r\nflat-topped hills before, he had no clew to their structure or their\r\nage,—whether granite, as they have been said to be, or sandstone or\r\nlimestone; whether primitive, secondary, or tertiary: and their strange\r\nform made the problem still more difficult. Now he sees them simply as\r\nthe remnants of a plain which once filled the whole valley of the\r\nAmazons, from the Andes to the Atlantic, from Guiana to Central Brazil.\r\nDenudations on a colossal scale, hitherto unknown to geologists, have\r\nturned this plain into a labyrinth of noble rivers, leaving only here\r\nand there, where the formation has resisted the rush of waters, low\r\nmountains and chains of hills to tell what was its thickness.[89]\r\n\r\n_February 1st._—On Tuesday evening we reached Porto do Moz, on the river\r\nXingú, where we had expected to be detained several days, as Mr. Agassiz\r\nwished especially to obtain the fishes from this river, and, if\r\npossible, from its upper and lower course, between which rapids\r\nintervene. He found, however, his harvest ready to his hand. Senhor\r\nVinhas, with whom, when stopping here for a few hours on his voyage up\r\nthe river, he had had some conversation respecting the scientific\r\nobjects of his visit to the Amazons, has made during our absence one of\r\nthe finest collections obtained in the whole course of our journey,\r\ncontaining, in separate lots, the fishes from above and below the\r\ncascade. By means of this double collection, which Mr. Agassiz has\r\nalready examined carefully, he ascertains the fact that the faunæ on\r\neither side of the falls are entirely distinct from each other, as are\r\nthose of the upper and lower courses of the Amazons, and also those of\r\nits tributaries, lakes, and igarapés. This is a most important addition\r\nto the evidence already obtained of the distinct localization of species\r\nthroughout the waters of the Amazonian Valley. We regretted that, on\r\naccount of the absence of Senor Vinhas from the town, we could not thank\r\nhim in person for this valuable contribution. Finding that the efforts\r\nof this gentleman had really left nothing to be done in this locality,\r\nunless, indeed, we could have stayed long enough to make collections in\r\nall the water-basins connected with the Xingu, we left early in the\r\nmorning and reached Gurupá yesterday. This little town stands on a low\r\ncliff some thirty feet above the river. On a projecting point of this\r\ncliff there is an old, abandoned fort; and in the open place adjoining\r\nit stands a church of considerable size, and seemingly in good repair.\r\nBut the settlement is evidently not prosperous. Many of its houses are\r\nruinous and deserted, and there is even less of activity in the aspect\r\nof the place than in most of the Amazonian villages. We heard much of\r\nits insalubrity, and found very severe cases of intermittent fever in\r\none or two of the houses we entered. While Mr. Agassiz made a call upon\r\nthe subdelegado, who was himself confined to his room with fever, I was\r\ninvited to rest in the open veranda of a neighboring house, which looked\r\npretty and attractive enough; for it opened into a sunny garden, where\r\nbananas and oranges and palm-trees were growing. But the old woman who\r\nreceived me complained bitterly of the dampness, to which, indeed, her\r\nhoarse cough and rheumatism bore testimony; and a man was lying in his\r\nhammock, slung under the porch, who was worn to mere skin and bone with\r\nfever. Here also we received some valuable specimens, collected, since\r\nour previous visit, by the subdelegado and one or two other residents.\r\n\r\n_February 3d._—On Thursday we reached Tajapuru, where we were detained\r\nfor two days on account of some little repair needed on the steamer. The\r\nplace is interesting as showing what may be done on the Amazons in a\r\nshort time by enterprise and industry. A settler in these regions may,\r\nif he has the taste and culture to appreciate it, surround himself with\r\nmuch that is attractive in civilized life. Some seventeen years ago\r\nSenhor Sepeda established himself at this spot, then a complete\r\nwilderness. He has now a very large and pleasant country-house, with a\r\ngarden in front and walks in the forest around. The interior of the\r\nhouse is commodious and tasteful; and we could not but wish, while we\r\nenjoyed Senhor Sepeda’s hospitality, that his example might be followed,\r\nand that there might be many such homes on the banks of the Amazons.\r\nThis morning we are again on our way down the river.\r\n\r\n_February 4th._—We reached Pará to-day, parting, not without regret,\r\nfrom the “Ibicuhy,” on board of which we have spent so many pleasant\r\nweeks. Before we left the vessel, Captain Faria ordered the carpenter to\r\ntake down our little pavilion on deck. It had been put up for our\r\naccommodation, and had served as our dining-room and our working-room,\r\nour shelter from the sun, and our snug retreat in floods of rain.[90] On\r\narriving in Pará we found ourselves at once at home in the house of our\r\nkind friend, Senhor Pimenta Bueno, where we look forward to a pleasant\r\nrest from our wanderings. I insert here a letter to the Emperor, written\r\ntwo or three weeks later, and containing a short summary of the\r\nscientific work on the Amazons.\r\n\r\n                                               PARÁ, 23 Février, 1866.\r\n\r\n  SIRE:—En arrivant à Pará, au commencement de ce mois j’ai eu le\r\n  bonheur d’y trouver l’excellente lettre de Votre Majesté, qui\r\n  m’attendait depuis quelques jours. J’aurais dû y répondre\r\n  immédiatement; mais je n’étais pas en état de le faire, tant j’étais\r\n  accablé de fatigue. Il y a trois ou quatre jours seulement que je\r\n  commence de nouveau à m’occuper de mes affaires. J’avouerai même que\r\n  le pressentiment des regrets qui m’auraient poursuivi le reste de\r\n  mes jours m’a seul empêché de retourner directement aux Etats-Unis.\r\n  Aujourd’hui encore j’ai de la peine à vaquer aux occupations les\r\n  plus simples. Et cependant je ne suis pas malade; je suis seulement\r\n  épuisé par un travail incessant et par la contemplation tous les\r\n  jours plus vive et plus impressive des grandeurs et des beautés de\r\n  cette nature tropicale. J’aurais besoin pour quelque temps de la vue\r\n  monotone et sombre d’une forêt de sapins.\r\n\r\n  Que vous êtes bon, Sire, de penser à moi au milieu des affaires\r\n  vitales qui absorbent votre attention et combien vos procédés sont\r\n  pleins de délicatesse. Le cadeau de nouvel-an que vous m’annoncez\r\n  m’enchante. La perspective de pouvoir ajouter quelques comparaisons\r\n  des poissons du bassin de l’Uruguay à celles que j’ai déjà faites\r\n  des espèces de l’Amazone et des fleuves de la côte orientale du\r\n  Brésil a un attrait tout particulier. Ce sera le premier pas vers la\r\n  connaissance des types de la zône tempérée dans l’Amérique du Sud.\r\n  Aussi est-ce avec une impatience croissante que je vois venir le\r\n  moment où je pourrai les examiner. En attendant, permettez-moi de\r\n  vous donner un aperçu rapide des résultats obtenus jusqu’à ce jour\r\n  dans le voyage de l’Amazone.\r\n\r\n  Je ne reviendrai pas sur ce qu’il y a de surprenant dans la grande\r\n  variété des espèces de poissons de ce bassin, bien qu’il me soit\r\n  encore difficile de me familiariser avec l’idée que l’Amazone\r\n  nourrit à peu-près deux fois plus d’espèces que la Méditerrannée et\r\n  un nombre plus considérable que l’Océan Atlantique d’un pôle à\r\n  l’autre. Je ne puis cependant plus dire avec la même précision quel\r\n  est le nombre exact d’espèces de l’Amazone que nous nous sommes\r\n  procurées, parceque depuis que je reviens sur mes pas, en descendant\r\n  le grand fleuve, je vois des poissons prêts à frayer que j’avais vus\r\n  dans d’autres circonstances et vice versâ, et sans avoir recours aux\r\n  collections que j’ai faites il y a six mois et qui ne me sont pas\r\n  accessibles aujourd’hui, il m’est souvent impossible de déterminer\r\n  de mémoire si ce sont les mêmes espèces ou d’autres qui m’avaient\r\n  échappé lors de mon premier examen. J’estime cependant que le nombre\r\n  total des espèces que je possède actuellement dépasse dix-huit cents\r\n  et atteint peut-être à deux mille. Mais ce n’est pas seulement le\r\n  nombre des espèces qui surprendra les naturalistes; le fait qu’elles\r\n  sont pour la plupart circonscrites dans des limites restreintes est\r\n  bien plus surprenant encore et ne laissera pas que d’avoir une\r\n  influence directe sur les idées qui se répandent de nos jours sur\r\n  l’origine des êtres vivants. Que dans un fleuve comme le\r\n  Mississippi, qui, du Nord au Sud, passe successivement par les zones\r\n  froide, tempérée et chaude, qui roule ses eaux tantôt sur une\r\n  formation géologique, tantôt sur une autre, et traverse des plaines\r\n  couvertes au Nord d’une végétation presque arctique et au Sud d’une\r\n  flore subtropicale,—que dans un pareil bassin on rencontre des\r\n  espèces d’animaux aquatiques différentes, sur différents points de\r\n  son trajet, ça se comprend dès qu’on s’est habitué à envisager les\r\n  conditions générales d’existence et le climat en particulier comme\r\n  la cause première de la diversité que les animaux et les plantes\r\n  offrent entre eux, dans les différentes localités; mais que, de\r\n  Tabatinga au Pará, dans un fleuve où les eaux ne varient ni par leur\r\n  température, ni par la nature de leur lit, ni par la végétation qui\r\n  les borde, que dans de pareilles circonstances on rencontre, de\r\n  distance en distance, des assemblages de poissons complètement\r\n  distincts les uns des autres, c’est ce qui a lieu d’étonner. Je\r\n  dirai même que dorénavant cette distribution, qui peut être vérifiée\r\n  par quiconque voudra s’en donner la peine, doit jeter beaucoup de\r\n  doute sur l’opinion qui attribue la diversité des êtres vivants aux\r\n  influences locales.\r\n\r\n  Un autre côté de ce sujet, encore plus curieux peut-être, est\r\n  l’intensité avec laquelle la vie s’est manifestée dans ces eaux.\r\n  Tous les fleuves de l’Europe réunis, depuis le Tage jusqu’au Volga,\r\n  ne nourissent pas cent cinquante espèces de poissons d’eau douce; et\r\n  cependant, dans un petit lac des environs de Manaos, nommé Lago\r\n  Hyanuary, qui a à peine quatre ou cinq-cents mètres carrés de\r\n  surface, nous avons découvert plus de deux-cents espèces distinctes,\r\n  dont la plupart n’ont pas encore été observées ailleurs. Quel\r\n  contraste!\r\n\r\n  L’étude du mélange des races humaines qui se croisent dans ces\r\n  régions m’a aussi beaucoup occupé et je me suis procuré de\r\n  nombreuses photographies de tous les types que j’ai pu observer. Le\r\n  principal résultat auquel je suis arrivé est que les races se\r\n  comportent les unes vis-à-vis des autres comme des espèces\r\n  distinctes; c. à. d. que les hybrides qui naissent du croisement\r\n  d’hommes de race différente sont toujours un mélange des deux types\r\n  primitifs et jamais la simple reproduction des caractères de l’un ou\r\n  de l’autre des progéniteurs, comme c’est le cas pour les races\r\n  d’animaux domestiques.\r\n\r\n  Je ne dirai rien de mes autres collections qui ont pour la plupart\r\n  été faites par mes jeunes compagnons de voyage, plutôt en vue\r\n  d’enrichir notre musée que de résoudre quelques questions\r\n  scientifiques. Mais je ne saurais laisser passer cette occasion sans\r\n  exprimer ma vive reconnaissance pour toutes les facilités que j’ai\r\n  dues à la bienveillance de Votre Majesté, dans mes explorations.\r\n  Depuis le Président jusqu’au plus humbles employés des provinces que\r\n  j’ai parcourues, tous ont rivalisé d’empressement pour me faciliter\r\n  mon travail et la Compagnie des vapeurs de l’Amazone a été d’une\r\n  libéralité extrême à mon égard. Enfin, Sire, la générosité avec\r\n  laquelle vous avez fait mettre un navire de guerre à ma disposition\r\n  m’a permis de faire des collections qui seraient restées\r\n  inaccessibles pour moi, sans un moyen de transport aussi vaste et\r\n  aussi rapide. Permettez-moi d’ajouter que de toutes les faveurs dont\r\n  Votre Majesté m’a comblé pour ce voyage, la plus précieuse a été la\r\n  présence du Major Coutinho, dont la familiarité avec tout ce qui\r\n  regarde l’Amazone a été une source intarissable de renseignements\r\n  importants et de directions utiles pour éviter des courses oiseuses\r\n  et la perte d’un temps précieux. L’étendue des connaissances de\r\n  Coutinho, en ce qui touche l’Amazone, est vraiment encyclopédique,\r\n  et je crois que ce serait un grand service à rendre à la science que\r\n  de lui fournir l’occasion de rédiger et de publier tout ce qu’il a\r\n  observé pendant ses visites répétées et prolongées dans cette partie\r\n  de l’Empire. Sa coopération pendant ce dernier voyage a été des plus\r\n  laborieuses; il s’est mis à la zoologie comme si les sciences\r\n  physiques n’avaient pas été l’objet spécial de ses études, en même\r\n  temps qu’il a fait par devers lui de nombreuses observations\r\n  thermométriques, barométriques, et astronomiques, qui ajouteront de\r\n  bons jalons à ce que l’on possède déjà sur la météorologie et la\r\n  topographie de ces provinces. C’est ainsi que nous avons les\r\n  premiers porté le baromètre au milieu des collines d’Almeyrim, de\r\n  Monte Alégre, et d’Ereré et mesuré leurs sommets les plus élevés.\r\n\r\n  L’étude de la formation de la vallée de l’Amazone m’a naturellement\r\n  occupé, bien que secondairement, dès le premier jour que je l’ai\r\n  abordée.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Mais il est temps que je finisse cette longue épître en demandant\r\n  pardon à Votre Majesté d’avoir mis sa patience à une aussi rude\r\n  épreuve.\r\n\r\n  De Votre Majesté le serviteur le plus dévoué et le plus affectueux,\r\n\r\n                                                       L. AGASSIZ.[91]\r\n\r\n_February 24th._—Pará, Nazareth. Our time has passed so quietly here\r\nthat it gives me nothing to record. Mr. Agassiz has found himself in\r\nsuch absolute need of rest, after having arranged and put in order for\r\ntransportation to the United States the collections accumulated, that\r\nour intended trip to the island of Marajo has been postponed day after\r\nday. Yesterday I witnessed a religious procession in Pará,—one of the\r\nmany festas said to be gradually dying out, and to be already shorn of\r\nmuch of their ancient glory. It represented a scene from the passion of\r\nChrist. The life-size figure of the Saviour, sinking under the cross, is\r\nborne on a platform through the streets. Little girls, dressed as\r\nangels, walk before it, and it is accompanied by numerous dignitaries of\r\nthe Church. Altars are illuminated in the different churches; the\r\npopulace, even down to the children, are dressed in black; and the\r\nbalconies of every house filled with figures in mourning, waiting for\r\nthe sad procession to pass by.\r\n\r\n_February 28th._—Off Marajo, in the steamer Tabatinga. All great rivers,\r\nas the Nile, the Mississippi, the Ganges, the Danube, have their deltas;\r\nbut the largest river in the world, the Amazons, is an exception to this\r\nrule. What, then, is the geological character of the great island which\r\nobstructs its opening into the ocean? This is the question which has\r\nmade a visit to Marajo of special interest to Mr. Agassiz. Leaving Pará\r\nat midnight, we reached the little town of Sourés early this morning. It\r\nis a village lying on the southeastern side of the island, and so far\r\nseaward that, in the dry season, when the diminished current of the\r\nAmazonian waters is overborne by the tides, the water is salt enough to\r\nafford excellent sea-bathing, and is resorted to for that purpose by\r\nmany families from Pará. At this moment, however, the water has not even\r\na brackish character. The only building of any interest in the town is\r\nthe old Jesuit church, a remnant of the earliest chapter in the\r\ncivilization of South America. However tinged with ambition and a love\r\nof temporal power, the work of the Jesuits in Brazil tended toward the\r\nestablishment of an organized system of labor, which one cannot but wish\r\nhad been continued. All that remains of the Jesuit missions goes to\r\nprove that they were centres of industry. These men contrived to impart,\r\neven to the wandering Indian, some faint reflection of their own\r\npersistency and steadfastness of purpose. Farms were connected with all\r\nthe Indian missions; under the direction of the fathers, the Indians\r\nlearned something of agriculture, which the Jesuits readily saw to be\r\none of the great civilizing influences in a country so fertile. They\r\nintroduced a variety of vegetables and grains, and had herds of cattle\r\nwhere cattle now are hardly known. Humboldt, speaking of the destruction\r\nof the Jesuit missions, says, in reference to the Indians of Atures, on\r\nthe Orinoco: “Formerly, being excited to labor by the Jesuits, they did\r\nnot want for food. The fathers cultivated maize, French beans, and other\r\nEuropean vegetables. They even planted sweet oranges and tamarinds round\r\nthe villages; and they possessed twenty or thirty thousand head of cows\r\nand horses in the savannas of Atures and Carichana.... Since the year\r\n1795, the cattle of the Jesuits have entirely disappeared. There now\r\nremain as monuments of the ancient cultivation of these countries, and\r\nthe active industry of the first missionaries, only a few trunks of the\r\norange and tamarind in the savannas, surrounded by wild trees.”[92]\r\n\r\nOur walk through the little village of Sourés brought us to the low\r\ncliffs on the shore, which we had already seen from the steamer. The\r\nsame formations prevail all along the coast of this island that we have\r\nfound everywhere on the banks of the Amazons. Lowest, a well-stratified,\r\nrather coarse sandstone, immediately above which, and conformable with\r\nit, are finely laminated clays, covered by a crust. Upon this lies the\r\nhighly ferruginous sandstone, in which an irregular cross stratification\r\nfrequently alternates with the regular beds; above this, following all\r\nthe undulations of its surface, is the well-known reddish sandy clay,\r\nwith quartz pebbles scattered through its mass, and only here and there\r\nfaint traces of an indistinct stratification. This afternoon Mr. Agassiz\r\nhas been again on shore, examining the formation of both banks of the\r\nIgarapé Grande, the river at the mouth of which stands the town of\r\nSourés. He has returned delighted with the result of his day’s work,\r\nhaving not only obtained the most complete evidence that the geological\r\nformation of Marajo corresponds exactly with that of the Amazonian\r\nValley, but having also obtained some very important data with respect\r\nto the present encroachments of the sea upon the shore. He found upon\r\nthe beach, partially covered by sea-sand, the remains of a forest which\r\nevidently grew in a peat-bog, and which the ocean is gradually laying\r\nbare.\r\n\r\n_February 29th._—Early this morning we crossed the Pará River, and\r\nanchored at the entrance of the bay within which stands the town of\r\nVigia. We landed, and while the boatmen were dragging the net, we\r\nwandered along the beach, which is bordered by thick forest, now full of\r\nflowers. Here we found the same geological formations as on the Marajo\r\nshore, and on the beach the counterpart of the ancient forest which Mr.\r\nAgassiz unearthed yesterday on the opposite coast. There can hardly be\r\nmore convincing evidence that the rivers which empty into the Amazons\r\nnear its mouth, like all those higher up, as well as the main stream\r\nitself, have cut their way through identical formations, which were once\r\ncontinuous. Evidently these remains of forests on the beaches of Vigia\r\nBay and at the mouth of the Igarapé Grande are parts of one forest,\r\nformerly uninterrupted and covering the whole of the intervening space\r\nnow filled by the so-called Pará River. We followed the beach to the\r\nentrance of an igarapé, which here opens into the river, and which\r\nlooked most tempting with the morning shadows darkening its cool\r\nrecesses. As the boatmen had not been very successful in fishing, I\r\nproposed we should put their services to better use and row up this\r\ninviting stream. To this day, though I have become accustomed to these\r\nforest water-paths and have had so many excursions in them, they have\r\nlost none of their charm. I never see one without longing to follow its\r\npicturesque windings into the depths of the wood; and to me the igarapé\r\nremains the most beautiful and the most characteristic feature of the\r\nAmazonian scenery. This one of Vigia was especially pretty. Clumps of\r\nthe light, exquisitely graceful Assai palm shot up everywhere from the\r\ndenser forest; here and there the drooping bamboo, never seen in the\r\nhigher Amazons, dipped its feathery branches into the water, covered\r\nsometimes to their very tips with purple bloom of convolvulus; yellow\r\nBignonias carried their golden clusters to the very summits of some of\r\nthe more lofty trees; while white-flowering myrtles and orange-colored\r\nmallows bordered the stream. Life abounded in this quiet retreat. Birds\r\nand butterflies were numerous; and we saw an immense number of crabs of\r\nevery variety of color and size upon the margin of the water. However,\r\nit was not so easy to catch them as it seemed. They would sit quietly on\r\nthe trunks of all the old trees or decaying logs projecting from the\r\nbank, apparently waiting to be taken; but the moment we approached them,\r\nhowever cautiously, they vanished like lightning either under the water\r\nor into some crevice near by. Notwithstanding their nimbleness, however,\r\nMr. Agassiz succeeded in making a considerable collection. We saw also\r\nan immense army of caterpillars, evidently following some concerted plan\r\nof action. They were descending the trunk of a large tree in a solid\r\nphalanx about two handbreadths in width, and six or eight feet in\r\nlength; no doubt coming down to make their chrysalids in the sand. We\r\nreturned to the steamer at ten o’clock; and, after breakfast, finding\r\nour anchorage-ground somewhat rough as the tide came in, we went a\r\nlittle higher up, and entered the Bahia do Sul. Here again we went on\r\nshore to see the net drawn, this time more successfully. We should have\r\nhad a delightful walk on the beach again, had it not been for hosts of\r\nminute flies which hovered about us, and had a power of stinging quite\r\ndisproportionate to their size. On returning we met with an unforeseen\r\ndifficulty. The tide had been falling during our walk, and the canoe\r\ncould not approach the beach within several yards. The gentlemen plunged\r\nin, and walked out over knees in water; while the boatmen made a chair\r\nof their arms and carried me through the surf.\r\n\r\n_March 5th._—Our excursion in the harbor closed with a visit to the\r\nsmall island of Tatuatuba, distant about six miles from Pará. In order\r\nto examine the shores, we made the circuit of the island on foot. Here\r\nagain the same geological structure presented itself; and there was one\r\nspot in particular where the sharp, vertical cut of the bank facing the\r\nbeach presented an admirable section of the formations so characteristic\r\nof the Amazonian Valley; the red, sandy clay of the upper deposit\r\nfilling in all the undulations and inequalities of the sandstone below,\r\nthe surface of which was remarkably irregular. The sea is making great\r\nencroachments on the shore of this island. Senhor Figueiredo, who lives\r\nhere with his family and by whom we were received with much hospitality,\r\ntold us that during the last eighteen or twenty years, the beach had\r\nreceded considerably in some places; the high-water line being many\r\nyards beyond its former limit. The result of this excursion has shown\r\nthat, with the exception of some low mud-islands nearly level with the\r\nwater, all the harbor islands lying in the mouth of the Amazons are,\r\ngeologically speaking, parts of the Amazonian Valley, having the same\r\nstructure. They were, no doubt, formerly continuous with the shore, but\r\nare separated now, partly by the fresh waters cutting their way through\r\nthe land to the ocean, partly by the progress of the sea itself.\r\n\r\n_March 24th._—Our quiet life at Nazareth, though full of enjoyment for\r\ntired travellers, affords little material for a journal. A second\r\nexcursion along the coast has furnished Mr. Agassiz with new evidence of\r\nthe rapid changes in the outline of the shore, produced by the\r\nencroachment of the sea. So fast is this going on that some of the\r\npublic works near the coast are already endangered by the advance of the\r\nocean upon the land. During the past week he has been especially\r\noccupied in directing the work of a photographist employed by Senhor\r\nPimenta Bueno, who, with his usual liberality towards the scientific\r\nobjects of the expedition, is collecting in this way the portraits of\r\nsome remarkable palms and other trees about his house and grounds. One\r\nof the most striking is a huge Sumauméra, with buttressed trunk. These\r\nbuttresses start at a distance of about eight or ten feet from the\r\nground, spreading gradually toward the base; they are from ten to twelve\r\nfeet in depth. The lower part of the trunk is thus divided into open\r\ncompartments, sometimes so large that two or three persons can stand\r\nwithin them. This disposition to throw out flanks or wings is not\r\nconfined to one kind of tree, but occurs in many families; it seems,\r\nindeed, a characteristic feature of forest vegetation here. Occasionally\r\nthe buttresses partially separate from the main trunk, remaining\r\nattached to it only at the point from which they start, so that they\r\nlook like distinct supports propping the tree. I copy here an extract\r\nfrom Mr. Agassiz’s notes upon the vegetation of the Amazons, in which\r\nallusion is made to the Sumauméra.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Buttressed Tree (Eriodendrum Sumauma).]\r\n\r\n“Any one coming from the North to the Tropics, if he has been in the\r\nhabit of observing the vegetation about him, even without having made\r\nbotany a special study, is, in a measure, prepared to appreciate the\r\nresemblances and the differences between plants of the tropical and\r\nthose of the temperate regions. An acquaintance with the Robinia\r\n(Locust-trees), for instance, or with the large shrub-like Lotus, and\r\nother woody Leguminosæ, will enable him to recognize the numerous\r\nrepresentatives of that family, forming so large a part of the\r\nequatorial vegetation; and, even should he never have seen specimens of\r\nthe Mimosa in gardens or hot-houses, their delicate, susceptible foliage\r\nwill make them known to him; he cannot fail to be struck with the\r\ninexhaustible combinations and forms of their pinnate leaves, as well as\r\nwith the variety in their tints of green, the diversity in their\r\nclusters of leaves and in their pods and seeds. But there are families\r\nwith which he fancies himself equally familiar, the tropical\r\nrepresentatives of which will never seem to him like old acquaintances.\r\nThus the tree which furnishes the Indian rubber belongs to the Milk-weed\r\nfamily. Every one knows the Milk-weeds of the North, to be seen, as\r\nhumble herbs, all along the roadsides, on the edges of our woods and in\r\nthe sands of our beaches. Yet on the Amazons, the Euphorbiaceæ, so small\r\nand unobtrusive with us, assume the form of colossal trees, constituting\r\na considerable part of its strange and luxuriant forest-growth. The\r\ngiant of the Amazonian woods, whose majestic flat crown towers over all\r\nother trees, while its white trunk stands out in striking relief from\r\nthe surrounding mass of green (the Sumauméra), is allied to our mallows.\r\nSome of the most characteristic trees of the river-shore belong to these\r\ntwo families. Our paleontologists who attempt to restore the forests of\r\nolder geological times should keep in mind this fact of the striking\r\ncontrasts presented under different latitudes by the same families. Of\r\ncourse the equatorial regions teem with plants and trees belonging to\r\nfamilies either entirely unknown or but poorly represented in more\r\ntemperate latitudes; and these distinct groups naturally arrest the\r\nattention of the botanist, and perhaps awaken his interest more than\r\nthose with which he is already familiar under other forms. But, while\r\nthese different families are recognized as distinct, and no doubt\r\ndeserve to be considered by themselves as natural groups, I believe that\r\nmuch might be learned of the deeper relations of plants by studying, not\r\nonly the representatives of the same families in different latitudes,\r\nsuch as the Mimosas and the Milk-weeds, but also what I may call\r\nbotanical equivalents,—groups which balance each other in the different\r\nclimatic zones. This idea is suggested to me by my zoölogical studies in\r\nthe Amazons, which have led me to perceive new relations between the\r\nanimals of the temperate and the tropical zone: it seems probable that\r\ncorresponding relations should exist in the vegetable world also.\r\nStruck, for instance, by the total absence of sturgeons, perches,\r\npickerels, trouts, carps and other white fishes, cusks, sculpins, &c., I\r\nhave asked myself, while studying the fishes of the Amazons, what\r\nanalogy could exist between those of our Western rivers and those of the\r\ntropics, as well as between the latter and those of the intermediate\r\nlatitudes. Looking at them with this view, I have been surprised to find\r\nhow closely related the Goniodonts are to the Sturgeons; so much so,\r\nthat the Loricariæ may be considered as genuine Sturgeons, with more\r\nextensive shields upon the body. I am satisfied also that the Cychla is\r\na perch to all intents and purposes, that the Acaras are Sunfishes, the\r\nXiphorhamphus (Pirà pucu) Pickerels, and the Curimatas genuine Carps.\r\nNow, may not a similar relation exist between the families of plants\r\nbelonging to the North and those forming the most prominent vegetation\r\nof the South? What are the tropical trees which take the place of our\r\nelms, maples, lindens? By what families are our oaks, chestnuts,\r\nwillows, poplars, represented under the burning sun of the equinoctial\r\nregions? The Rosaceæ in the temperate and the Myrtaceæ in the tropical\r\nregions seem to me such botanical equivalents. The family of Rosaceæ\r\ngives to the North its pears, its apples, its peaches, its cherries, its\r\nplums, its almonds; in short, all the most delicious fruits of the Old\r\nWorld, as well as its most beautiful flowers. The trees of this family,\r\nby their foliage, play a distinguished part in the vegetation of the\r\ntemperate zone, and impart to it a character of their own. The Myrtaceæ\r\ngive to the South its guavas, its pitangas, its araçàs, the juicy\r\nplum-like fruit of the swamp-myrtles, many of its nuts, and other\r\nexcellent fruits. This family, including the Melastomaceæ, abounds in\r\nflowering shrubs, like the purple Queresma and many others not less\r\nbeautiful; and some of its representatives, such as the Sapucaia and the\r\nBrazilian nut-tree, rise to the height of towering trees. Both of these\r\nfamilies sink to insignificance in the one zone, while they assume a\r\ndignified port and perform an important part in the other. If this\r\ninvestigation be extended to the shrubs and humbler plants, I believe\r\nthe botanist who undertakes it will reap a rich harvest.”\r\n\r\nThe day after to-morrow we leave Pará in the Santa Cruz for Ceará. It\r\nwill be like leaving a sort of home to say good by to our kind friends\r\nin the Rua de Nazareth. We have become attached to this neighborhood\r\nalso from its beauty. The wide street, bordered for two or three miles\r\nwith mangueiras, leads into the wooded country, where many a narrow\r\ngreen path in the forest tempts one to long rambles. One of these paths\r\nhas been a favorite walk of mine on account of the beauty and luxuriance\r\nof the vegetation, making some parts of it shady even at noonday. I have\r\noften followed it for two or three miles in the early morning, between\r\nsix and eight o’clock, when the verdant walls on either side are still\r\nfresh and dewy. Beautiful as it is, it leads to one of the saddest of\r\nall abodes. For a long time I could not understand why this lane was\r\nalways in such good condition, the heavy rains making unfrequented\r\nforest-paths almost impassable in the wet season. I found on inquiry\r\nthat it led to a hospital for lepers, and was kept in good repair\r\nbecause the various stores and supplies for the hospital were constantly\r\ncarried over it. The prevalence of leprosy has made it necessary to\r\nprovide separate establishments for its victims; and both at Pará and\r\nSantarem, where it is still more common, there are hospitals devoted\r\nexclusively to this purpose. This terrible disease is not confined\r\nwholly to the lower classes, and where it occurs in families whose\r\ncircumstances are good the invalid is often kept at home under the care\r\nof his own friends. Bates states that leprosy is supposed to be\r\nincurable, and also adds that, during his eleven years’ residence on the\r\nAmazons, he has never known a foreigner to be attacked by it. We have,\r\nhowever, been told by a very intelligent German physician in Rio de\r\nJaneiro, that he has known several cases of it among his own countrymen\r\nthere, and has been so fortunate as to effect permanent cures in some\r\ninstances. He says it is a mistake to suppose that it does not yield to\r\ntreatment when taken in time, and the statistics of the disease show\r\nthat, where there are good physicians, it is found to be gradually\r\ndisappearing.\r\n\r\nWe must not leave Pará without alluding to our evening concerts from the\r\nadjoining woods and swamps. When I first heard this strange confusion of\r\nsounds, I thought it came from a crowd of men shouting loudly, though at\r\na little distance. To my surprise, I found that the rioters were the\r\nfrogs and toads in the neighborhood. I hardly know how to describe this\r\nBabel of woodland noises; and if I could do it justice, I am afraid my\r\naccount would hardly be believed. At moments it seems like the barking\r\nof dogs, then like the calling of many voices on different keys, but all\r\nloud, rapid, excited, full of emphasis and variety. I think these frogs,\r\nlike ours, must be silent at certain seasons of the year; for, on our\r\nfirst visit to Pará, we were not struck by this singular music, with\r\nwhich the woods now resound at nightfall.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  NOTE.—Before leaving the Amazons, I wish to acknowledge attentions\r\n  received from several friends, whose names do not appear in the\r\n  narrative.\r\n\r\n  To Senhor Danin, Chef de Police at Pará, I was indebted for valuable\r\n  Indian curiosities, and for specimens of other kinds; to Doctor\r\n  Malcher for a collection of birds; to Senhor Penna for important\r\n  additions to my collection of fishes; to Senhor Laitaō da Cunha for\r\n  aid in collecting, and for many introductions to persons of\r\n  influence along our route; and to Mr. Kaulfuss, a German resident at\r\n  Pará, for fossils from the Andes.\r\n\r\n  I have to thank Mr. James Bond, United States Consul at Pará, for\r\n  unwearied efforts in my behalf during the whole time of my stay in\r\n  the Amazons. He supplied me with alcohol; received the collections\r\n  on their arrival at Pará; examined the cases and barrels, causing\r\n  those which were defective to be repaired, that they might reach\r\n  their destination in safety, and finally despatched them to the\r\n  United States, free of charge, on board sailing-vessels in which he\r\n  had an interest. We owe it in great degree to him that our immense\r\n  Amazonian collections arrived in Cambridge in good condition,\r\n  suffering little loss or injury in the process of transportation.—L.\r\n  A.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 88:\r\n\r\n  During my short stay in the neighborhood of Villa Bella and Obydos I\r\n  was indebted to several residents of these towns for assistance in\r\n  collecting; especially to Padre Torquato and to Padre Antonio Mattos.\r\n  My friend, Mr. Honorio, who accompanied me to this point, with the\r\n  assistance of the Delegado, at Villa Bella, made also a very excellent\r\n  collection of fishes in this vicinity. At Obydos Colonel Bentos\r\n  contributed a very large collection of fishes from the Rio\r\n  Trombetas.—L. A.\r\n\r\nFootnote 89:\r\n\r\n  See Chapter XIII., on the Physical History of the Amazons.\r\n\r\nFootnote 90:\r\n\r\n  It is but fitting that I should express here my thanks to Captain\r\n  Faria for the courteous manner in which he accomplished the task\r\n  assigned him by the government. He was not only a most hospitable host\r\n  on board his vessel, but he allowed me to encumber his deck with all\r\n  kinds of scientific apparatus, and gave me very efficient assistance\r\n  in collecting.—L. A.\r\n\r\nFootnote 91:\r\n\r\n                                                PARÁ, February 23, 1866.\r\n\r\n  SIRE:—On arriving at Pará in the beginning of this month, I had the\r\n  pleasure to find your Majesty’s kind letter, which had been awaiting\r\n  me for several days. I ought to have acknowledged it immediately, but\r\n  I was not in a condition to do so, being overcome by fatigue. It is\r\n  only during the last two or three days that I begin once more to\r\n  occupy myself as usual. I confess that nothing but the presentiment of\r\n  regrets which would have pursued me to the end of my days has\r\n  prevented me from returning directly to the United States. Even now I\r\n  find it difficult to take up the most simple occupations. And yet I am\r\n  not ill; I am only exhausted by incessant work, and by the\r\n  contemplation, each day more vivid and impressive, of the grandeur and\r\n  beauty of this tropical nature. I need to look for a time upon the\r\n  sombre and monotonous aspect of a pine forest.\r\n\r\n  How good you are, Sire, to think of me in the midst of the vital\r\n  affairs which absorb your attention, and how considerate are your\r\n  acts! The New Year’s present you announce enchants me.[93] The\r\n  prospect of being able to add some comparisons of the fishes from the\r\n  basin of the Uruguay to such as I have already made between the\r\n  Amazonian species and those of the rivers on the eastern coast of\r\n  Brazil has a special attraction for me. It will be the first step\r\n  towards a knowledge of the types of the temperate zone in South\r\n  America. I wait with increasing impatience for the moment when I shall\r\n  be able to examine them. In the mean while allow me to give you a\r\n  rapid sketch of the results thus far obtained in my voyage on the\r\n  Amazons.\r\n\r\n  I will not return to the surprising variety of species of fishes\r\n  contained in this basin, though it is very difficult for me to\r\n  familiarize myself with the idea that the Amazons nourishes nearly\r\n  twice as many species as the Mediterranean, and a larger number than\r\n  the Atlantic, taken from one pole to the other. I can no longer say,\r\n  however, with precision, what is the exact number of species which we\r\n  have procured from the Amazons, because, on retracing my steps as I\r\n  descended the great river, I have seen fishes about to lay their eggs\r\n  which I had seen at first under other conditions, and _vice versa_;\r\n  and without consulting the collections made six months ago, and which\r\n  are not now accessible to me, it is often impossible for me to\r\n  determine from memory whether they are the same species, or different\r\n  ones which escaped my observation in my first examination. However, I\r\n  estimate the total number of species which I actually possess at\r\n  eighteen hundred, and it may be two thousand.[94] But it is not only\r\n  the number of species which will astonish naturalists; the fact that\r\n  they are for the most part circumscribed within definite limits is\r\n  still more surprising, and cannot but have a direct influence on the\r\n  ideas now prevalent respecting the origin of living beings. That in a\r\n  river like the Mississippi, which from the north to the south passes\r\n  successively through cold, temperate, and warm zones,—whose waters\r\n  flow sometimes over one geological formation, sometimes over another,\r\n  and across plains covered at the north by an almost arctic vegetation,\r\n  and at the south by a sub-tropical flora,—that in such a basin aquatic\r\n  animals of different species should be met at various points of its\r\n  course is easily understood by those who are accustomed to consider\r\n  general conditions of existence, and of climate especially, as the\r\n  first cause of the difference between animals and plants inhabiting\r\n  separate localities. But that from Tabatinga to Pará, in a river where\r\n  the waters differ neither in temperature nor in the nature of their\r\n  bed, nor in the vegetation along their borders,—that under such\r\n  circumstances there should be met, from distance to distance,\r\n  assemblages of fishes completely distinct from each other, is indeed\r\n  astonishing. I would even say that henceforth this distribution, which\r\n  may be verified by any one who cares to take the trouble, must throw\r\n  much doubt on the opinion which attributes the diversity of living\r\n  beings to local influences. Another side of this subject, still more\r\n  curious perhaps, is the intensity with which life is manifested in\r\n  these waters. All the rivers of Europe united, from the Tagus to the\r\n  Volga, do not nourish one hundred and fifty species of fresh-water\r\n  fishes; and yet, in a little lake near Manaos, called Lago Hyanuary,\r\n  the surface of which covers hardly four or five hundred square yards,\r\n  we have discovered more than two hundred distinct species, the greater\r\n  part of which have not been observed elsewhere. What a contrast!\r\n\r\n  The study of the mixture of human races in this region has also\r\n  occupied me much, and I have procured numerous photographs of all the\r\n  types which I have been able to observe. The principal result at which\r\n  I have arrived is, that the _races_ bear themselves towards each other\r\n  as do distinct species; that is to say, that the hybrids, which spring\r\n  from the crossing of men of different races, are always a mixture of\r\n  the two primitive types, and never the simple reproduction of the\r\n  characters of one or the other progenitor, as is the case among the\r\n  races of domestic animals.\r\n\r\n  I will say nothing of my other collections, which have been made for\r\n  the most part by my young companions, rather with a view to enrich our\r\n  Museum than to solve scientific questions. But I cannot allow this\r\n  occasion to pass without expressing my lively gratitude for all the\r\n  facilities, in my explorations, which I have owed to the kindness of\r\n  your Majesty. From the President to the most humble employés of the\r\n  provinces I have visited, all have competed with each other to render\r\n  my work more easy; and the steamship company of the Amazons has shown\r\n  an extreme liberality towards me. Finally, Sire, the generosity with\r\n  which you have placed at my disposition a vessel of war has allowed me\r\n  to make collections which, with less ample and rapid means of\r\n  transport, must have remained utterly inaccessible to me. Permit me to\r\n  add, that, of all the favors with which your Majesty has crowned this\r\n  voyage, the most precious has been the presence of Major Coutinho,\r\n  whose familiarity with all which concerns the Amazons has been an\r\n  inexhaustible source of important information and of useful\r\n  directions; by means of which the loss of time in unremunerative\r\n  excursions has been avoided. His co-operation during this journey has\r\n  been most laborious; he has applied himself to zoölogy as if the\r\n  physical sciences had not hitherto been the special object of his\r\n  study, while at the same time he has made numerous thermometric,\r\n  barometric, and astronomical observations, which will furnish\r\n  important additions to what is already known concerning the\r\n  meteorology and topography of these provinces. We have, for instance,\r\n  been the first to carry the barometer into the midst of the hills of\r\n  Almeyrim, of Monte Alégre and Ereré, and to measure their highest\r\n  summits. The study of the formation of the valley of the Amazons has\r\n  naturally occupied me, though in a secondary degree, from the first\r\n  day of my arrival.[95]\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut it is time that I should close this long letter, begging your\r\nMajesty to pardon me for putting your patience to so hard a trial.\r\n\r\n           Your Majesty’s most humble and most affectionate servant,\r\n\r\n                                                             L.

The guests were some two hundred\r\nin number, and the whole affair was very unceremonious, assuming rather\r\nthe character of a meeting for conversation or discussion than that of\r\nan audience collected to hear a studied address. The substance of this\r\ntalk or lecture, as subsequently written out by Mr. Agassiz, afterward\r\nappeared in the Atlantic Monthly, and is inserted here, with some few\r\nalterations under the head of a separate chapter. The reader will find\r\noccasional repetitions of facts already stated in the earlier part of\r\nthe narrative; but they are retained for the sake of giving a complete\r\nand consistent review of the subject at this point of our journey, where\r\nit became possible to compare the geological structure of the Amazonian\r\nValley with that of the southern provinces of Brazil and of those\r\nbordering on the Atlantic coast.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe existence of a glacial period, however much derided when first\r\nannounced, is now a recognized fact. The divergence of opinion\r\nrespecting it is limited to a question of extent; and after my recent\r\njourney in the Amazons, I am led to add a new chapter to the strange\r\nhistory of glacial phenomena, taken from the southern hemisphere, and\r\neven from the tropics themselves.\r\n\r\nI am prepared to find that the statement of this new phase of the\r\nglacial period will awaken among my scientific colleagues an opposition\r\neven more violent than that by which the first announcement of my views\r\non this subject was met. I am, however, willing to bide my time; feeling\r\nsure that, as the theory of the ancient extension of glaciers in Europe\r\nhas gradually come to be accepted by geologists, so will the existence\r\nof like phenomena, both in North and South America, during the same\r\nepoch, be recognized sooner or later as part of a great series of\r\nphysical events extending over the whole globe. Indeed, when the\r\nice-period is fully understood, it will be seen that the absurdity lies\r\nin supposing that climatic conditions so different could be limited to a\r\nsmall portion of the world’s surface. If the geological winter existed\r\nat all, it must have been cosmic; and it is quite as rational to look\r\nfor its traces in the Western as in the Eastern hemisphere, to the south\r\nof the equator as to the north of it. Impressed by this wider view of\r\nthe subject, confirmed by a number of unpublished investigations which I\r\nhave made during the last three or four years in the United States, I\r\ncame to South America, expecting to find in the tropical regions new\r\nevidences of a bygone glacial period, though, of course, under different\r\naspects. Such a result seemed to me the logical sequence of what I had\r\nalready observed in Europe and in North America.\r\n\r\nOn my arrival in Rio de Janeiro,—the port at which I first landed in\r\nBrazil,—my attention was immediately attracted by a very peculiar\r\nformation consisting of an ochraceous, highly ferruginous, sandy clay.\r\nDuring a stay of three months in Rio, whence I made many excursions into\r\nthe neighboring country, I had opportunities of studying this deposit,\r\nboth in the province of Rio de Janeiro and in the adjoining province of\r\nMinas Geraes. I found that it rested everywhere upon the undulating\r\nsurfaces of the solid rocks in place, was almost entirely destitute of\r\nstratification, and contained a variety of pebbles and boulders. The\r\npebbles were chiefly quartz, sometimes scattered indiscriminately\r\nthroughout the deposit, sometimes lying in a seam between it and the\r\nrock below; while the boulders were either sunk in its mass, or resting\r\nloosely on the surface. At Tijuca, a few miles out of the city of Rio,\r\namong the picturesque hills lying to the southwest of it, these\r\nphenomena may be seen in great perfection. Near Bennett’s Hotel there\r\nare a great number of erratic boulders, having no connection whatever\r\nwith the rock in place; and also a bluff of this superficial deposit\r\nstudded with boulders, resting above the partially stratified\r\nmetamorphic rock.[96] Other excellent opportunities for observing this\r\nformation, also within easy reach from the city, are afforded along the\r\nwhole line of the Dom Pedro Segundo Railroad, where the cuts expose\r\nadmirable sections, showing the red, unstratified, homogeneous mass of\r\nsandy clay resting above the solid rock, and often divided from it by a\r\nthin bed of pebbles. There can be no doubt, in the mind of any one\r\nfamiliar with similar facts observed in other parts of the world, that\r\nthis is one of the many forms of drift connected with glacial action. I\r\nwas, however, far from anticipating, when I first met it in the\r\nneighborhood of Rio, that I should afterwards find it spreading over the\r\nsurface of the country from north to south and from east to west, with a\r\ncontinuity which gives legible connection to the whole geological\r\nhistory of the continent.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the extensive decomposition of the underlying rock,\r\npenetrating sometimes to a considerable depth, makes it often difficult\r\nto distinguish between it and the drift; and the problem is made still\r\nmore puzzling by the fact that the surface of the drift, when baked by\r\nexposure to the hot sun, often assumes the appearance of decomposed\r\nrock, so that great care is required for a correct interpretation of the\r\nfacts. A little practice, however, trains the eye to read these\r\nappearances aright; and I may say that I have learned to recognize\r\neverywhere the limit between the two formations. There is indeed one\r\nsafe guide, namely, the undulating line, reminding one of _roches\r\nmoutonnées_,[97] and marking the irregular surface of the rock on which\r\nthe drift was accumulated; whatever modifications the one or the other\r\nmay have undergone, this line seems never to disappear. Another\r\ndeceptive feature, arising from the frequent disintegration of the rocks\r\nand from the brittle character of some of them, is the presence of loose\r\nfragments, which simulate erratic boulders, but are in fact only\r\ndetached masses of the rock in place. A careful examination of their\r\nstructure, however, will at once show the geologist whether they belong\r\nwhere they are found, or have been brought from a distance to their\r\npresent resting-place.\r\n\r\nBut, while the features to which I have alluded are unquestionably drift\r\nphenomena, they present in their wider extension, and especially in the\r\nnorthern part of Brazil, some phases of glacial action hitherto\r\nunobserved. Just as the investigation of the ice-period in the United\r\nStates has shown us that ice-fields may move over open level plains, as\r\nwell as along the slopes of mountain valleys, so does a study of the\r\nsame class of facts in South America reveal new and unlooked-for\r\nfeatures in the history of the ice-period. Some will say that the fact\r\nof the advance of ice-fields over an open country is by no means\r\nestablished, inasmuch as many geologists believe all the so-called\r\nglacial traces—viz. striæ, furrows, polish, etc., found in the United\r\nStates—to have been made by floating icebergs at a time when the\r\ncontinent was submerged. To this I can only answer that, in the State of\r\nMaine, I have followed, compass in hand, the same set of furrows,\r\nrunning from north to south in one unvarying line, over a surface of one\r\nhundred and thirty miles, from the Katahdin Iron Range to the\r\nsea-shore.[98] These furrows follow all the inequalities of the country,\r\nascending ranges of hills varying from twelve to fifteen hundred feet in\r\nheight, and descending into the intervening valleys only two or three\r\nhundred feet above the sea, or sometimes even on a level with it. I take\r\nit to be impossible that a floating mass of ice should travel onward in\r\none rectilinear direction, turning neither to the right nor to the left,\r\nfor such a distance. Equally impossible would it be for a detached mass\r\nof ice, swimming on the surface of the water, or even with its base sunk\r\nconsiderably below it, to furrow in a straight line the summits and\r\nsides of the hills, and the bottoms of the intervening valleys. It would\r\nbe carried over the inequalities of the country without touching the\r\nlowest depressions. Instead of ascending the mountains, it would remain\r\nstranded against any elevation which rose greatly above its own base,\r\nand, if caught between two parallel ridges, would float up and down\r\nbetween them. Moreover, the action of solid, unbroken ice, moving over\r\nthe ground in immediate contact with it, is so different from that of\r\nfloating ice-rafts or icebergs that, though the latter have\r\nunquestionably dropped erratic boulders, and made furrows and striæ on\r\nthe surface where they happened to be grounded, these phenomena will\r\neasily be distinguished from the more connected tracks of glaciers, or\r\nextensive sheets of ice, resting directly upon the face of the country\r\nand advancing over it.\r\n\r\nThere seems thus far to be an inextricable confusion in the ideas of\r\nmany geologists as to the respective action of currents, icebergs, and\r\nglaciers. It is time that they should learn to distinguish between\r\nclasses of facts so different from each other, and so easily recognized\r\nafter the discrimination has once been made. As to the southward\r\nmovement of an immense field of ice, extending over the whole North, it\r\nseems inevitable, the moment we admit that snow may accumulate around\r\nthe pole in such quantities as to initiate a pressure radiating in every\r\ndirection. Snow, alternately thawing and freezing, must, like water,\r\nfind its level at last. A sheet of snow ten or fifteen thousand feet in\r\nthickness, extending all over the northern and southern portions of the\r\nglobe, must necessarily lead, in the end, to the formation of a northern\r\nand southern cap of ice, moving toward the equator.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of Tijuca and the Dom Pedro Railroad as favorable\r\nlocalities for studying the peculiar southern drift; but one meets it in\r\nevery direction. A sheet of drift, consisting of the same homogeneous,\r\nunstratified paste, and containing loose materials of all sorts and\r\nsizes, covers the country. It is of very uneven thickness,—sometimes\r\nthrown into relief, as it were, by the surrounding denudations, and\r\nrising into hills; sometimes reduced to a thin layer; sometimes, as, for\r\ninstance, on steep slopes, washed entirely away, leaving the bare face\r\nof the rock exposed. It has, however, remained comparatively undisturbed\r\non some very abrupt ascents; as may be seen on the Corcovado, along the\r\npath leading up the mountain, where there are some very fine banks of\r\ndrift, the more striking from the contrast of their deep-red color with\r\nthe surrounding vegetation. I have myself followed this sheet of drift\r\nfrom Rio de Janeiro to the top of the Serra do Mar, where, just outside\r\nthe pretty town of Petropolis, the river Piabanha may be seen flowing\r\nbetween banks of drift, in which it has excavated its bed; thence I have\r\ntraced it along the beautiful macadamized road leading to Juiz de Fora\r\nin the province of Minas Geraes, and beyond this to the farther side of\r\nthe Serra da Babylonia. Throughout this whole tract of country the drift\r\nmay be seen along the roadside, in immediate contact with the native\r\ncrystalline rock. The fertility of the land, also, is a guide to the\r\npresence of drift. Wherever it lies thickest over the surface, there are\r\nthe most flourishing coffee-plantations; and I believe that a more\r\nsystematic regard to this fact would have a most beneficial influence\r\nupon the agricultural interests of the country. No doubt the fertility\r\narises from the great variety of chemical elements contained in the\r\ndrift, and the kneading process it has undergone beneath the gigantic\r\nice-plough,—a process which makes glacial drift everywhere the most\r\nfertile soil. Since my return from the Amazons, my impression as to the\r\ngeneral distribution of these phenomena has been confirmed by the\r\nreports of some of my assistants, who have been travelling in other\r\nparts of the country. Mr. Frederick C. Hartt, accompanied by Mr.\r\nCopeland, one of the volunteer aids of the expedition, has been making\r\ncollections and geological observations in the province of Spiritu\r\nSanto, in the valley of the Rio Doce, and afterwards in the valley of\r\nthe Mucury. He informs me that he has found everywhere the same sheet of\r\nred, unstratified clay, with pebbles and occasional boulders overlying\r\nthe rock in place. Mr. Orestes St. John, who, taking the road through\r\nthe interior, has visited, with the same objects in view, the valleys of\r\nthe Rio San Francisco and the Rio das Velhas, and also the valley of\r\nPiauhy, gives the same account, with the exception that he found no\r\nerratic boulders in these more northern regions. The rarity of erratic\r\nboulders, not only in the deposits of the Amazons proper, but in those\r\nof the whole region which may be considered as the Amazonian basin, is\r\naccounted for, as we shall see hereafter, by the mode of their\r\nformation. The observations of Mr. Hartt and Mr. St. John are the more\r\nvaluable, because I had employed them both, on our first arrival in Rio,\r\nin making geological surveys of different sections on the Dom Pedro\r\nRailroad, so that they had a great familiarity with those formations\r\nbefore starting on their separate journeys. Recently, Mr. St. John and\r\nmyself met in Pará on our return from our respective explorations, and I\r\nhave had an opportunity of comparing on the spot his geological sections\r\nfrom the valley of the Piauhy with the Amazonian deposits. There can be\r\nno doubt of the absolute identity of the formations in these valleys.\r\n\r\nHaving arranged the work of my assistants, and sent several of them to\r\ncollect and make geological examinations in other directions, I myself,\r\nwith the rest of my companions, proceeded up the coast to Pará. I was\r\nsurprised to find at every step of my progress the same geological\r\nphenomena which had met me at Rio. It was my friend, Major Coutinho,\r\nalready an experienced Amazonian traveller, who first told me that this\r\nformation continued through the whole valley of the Amazons, and was\r\nalso to be found on all of its affluents which he had visited, although\r\nhe had never thought of referring it to so recent a period. And here let\r\nme say that the facts I now state are by no means exclusively the result\r\nof my own investigations. They are in great part due to Major Coutinho,\r\na member of the Brazilian government corps of engineers, who, by the\r\nkindness of the Emperor, was associated with me in my Amazonian\r\nexpedition. I can truly say that he has been my good genius throughout\r\nthe whole journey, saving me, by his previous knowledge of the ground,\r\nfrom the futile and misdirected expenditure of means and time often\r\ninevitable in a new country, where one is imperfectly acquainted both\r\nwith the people and their language. We have worked together in this\r\ninvestigation; my only advantage over him being my greater familiarity\r\nwith like phenomena in Europe and North America, and consequent\r\nreadiness in the practical handling of the facts and in perceiving their\r\nconnection. Major Coutinho’s assertion, that on the banks of the Amazons\r\nI should find the same red, unstratified clay as in Rio and along the\r\nsouthern coast, seemed to me at first almost incredible, impressed as I\r\nwas with the generally received notions as to the ancient character of\r\nthe Amazonian deposits, referred by Humboldt to the Devonian, and by\r\nMartius to the Triassic period, and considered by all travellers to be\r\nat least as old as the Tertiaries. The result, however, confirmed his\r\nreport, at least so far as the component materials of the formation are\r\nconcerned; but, as will be seen hereafter, the mode of their deposition,\r\nand the time at which it took place, have not been the same at the north\r\nand south; and this difference of circumstances has modified the aspect\r\nof a formation essentially the same throughout. At first sight, it would\r\nindeed appear that this formation, as it exists in the valley of the\r\nAmazons, is identical with that of Rio; but it differs from it in the\r\nrarity of its boulders, and in showing occasional signs of\r\nstratification. It is also everywhere underlaid by coarse,\r\nwell-stratified deposits, resembling somewhat the _Recife_ of Bahia and\r\nPernambuco; whereas the unstratified drift of the south rests\r\nimmediately upon the undulating surface of whatever rock happens to make\r\nthe foundation of the country, whether stratified or crystalline. The\r\npeculiar sandstone on which the Amazonian clay rests exists nowhere\r\nelse. Before proceeding, however, to describe the Amazonian deposits in\r\ndetail, I ought to say something of the nature and origin of the valley\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nThe valley of the Amazons was first sketched out by the elevation of two\r\ntracts of land; namely, the plateau of Guiana on the north, and the\r\ncentral plateau of Brazil on the south. It is probable that, at the time\r\nthese two table-lands were lifted above the sea-level, the Andes did not\r\nexist, and the ocean flowed between them through an open strait. It\r\nwould seem (and this is a curious result of modern geological\r\ninvestigations) that the portions of the earth’s surface earliest raised\r\nabove the ocean have trended from east to west. The first tract of land\r\nlifted above the waters in North America was also a long continental\r\nisland, running from Newfoundland almost to the present base of the\r\nRocky Mountains. This tendency may be attributed to various causes,—to\r\nthe rotation of the earth, the consequent depression of its poles, and\r\nthe breaking of its crust along the lines of greatest tension thus\r\nproduced. At a later period, the upheaval of the Andes took place,\r\nclosing the western side of this strait, and thus transforming it into a\r\ngulf, open only toward the east. Little or nothing is known of the\r\nearlier stratified deposits resting against the crystalline masses first\r\nuplifted along the borders of the Amazonian Valley. There is here no\r\nsequence, as in North America, of Azoic, Silurian, Devonian, and\r\nCarboniferous formations, shored up against each other by the gradual\r\nupheaval of the continent; although, unquestionably, older palæozoic and\r\nsecondary beds underlie, here and there, the later formations. Indeed,\r\nMajor Coutinho has found palæozoic deposits, with characteristic\r\nBrachiopods, in the valley of the Rio Tapajos, at the first cascade, and\r\ncarboniferous deposits have been noticed along the Rio Guapore and the\r\nRio Mamore. But the first chapter in the valley’s geological history\r\nabout which we have connected and trustworthy data is that of the\r\ncretaceous period. It seems certain, that, at the close of the secondary\r\nage, the whole Amazonian basin became lined with a cretaceous deposit,\r\nthe margins of which crop out at various localities on its borders. They\r\nhave been observed along its southern limits, on its western outskirts\r\nalong the Andes, in Venezuela along the shore-line of mountains, and\r\nalso in certain localities near its eastern edge. I well remember that\r\none of the first things which awakened my interest in the geology of the\r\nAmazonian Valley was the sight of some cretaceous fossil fishes from the\r\nprovince of Ceará. These fossil fishes were collected by Mr. George\r\nGardner, to whom science is indebted for the most extensive information\r\nyet obtained respecting the geology of that part of Brazil. In this\r\nconnection, let me say that I shall speak of the provinces of Ceará,\r\nPiauhy, and Maranham as belonging geologically to the valley of the\r\nAmazons, though their shore is bathed by the ocean and their rivers\r\nempty directly into the Atlantic. But I entertain no doubt that, at an\r\nearlier period, the north-eastern coast of Brazil stretched much farther\r\nseaward than in our day; so far, indeed, that in those times the rivers\r\nof all these provinces must have been tributaries of the Amazons in its\r\neastward course. The evidence for this conclusion is substantially\r\nderived from the identity of the deposits in the valleys belonging to\r\nthese provinces with those of the valleys through which the actual\r\ntributaries of the Amazons flow; as, for instance, the Tocantins, the\r\nXingu, the Tapajos, the Madeira, etc. Besides the fossils above alluded\r\nto from the eastern borders of this ancient basin, I have had recently\r\nanother evidence of its cretaceous character from its southern region.\r\nMr. William Chandless, on his return from a late journey on the Rio\r\nPurus, presented me with a series of fossil remains of the highest\r\ninterest, and undoubtedly belonging to the cretaceous period. They were\r\ncollected by himself on the Rio Aquiry, an affluent of the Rio Purus.\r\nMost of them were found in place between the tenth and eleventh degrees\r\nof south latitude, and the sixty-seventh and sixty-ninth degrees of west\r\nlongitude from Greenwich, in localities varying from four hundred and\r\nthirty to six hundred and fifty feet above the sea-level. There are\r\namong them remains of Mosasaurus, and of fishes closely allied to those\r\nalready represented by Faujas in his description of Maestricht, and\r\ncharacteristic, as is well known to geological students, of the most\r\nrecent cretaceous period.\r\n\r\nThus in its main features the valley of the Amazons, like that of the\r\nMississippi, is a cretaceous basin. This resemblance suggests a further\r\ncomparison between the twin continents of North and South America. Not\r\nonly is their general form the same, but their framework, as we may call\r\nit,—that is, the lay of their great mountain-chains and of their\r\ntable-lands, with the extensive intervening depressions,—presents a\r\nstriking similarity. Indeed, a zoölogist, accustomed to trace a like\r\nstructure under variously modified animal forms, cannot but have his\r\nhomological studies recalled to his mind by the coincidence between\r\ncertain physical features in the northern and southern parts of the\r\nWestern hemisphere. And yet here, as throughout all nature, these\r\ncorrespondences are combined with a distinctness of individualization\r\nwhich leaves its respective character, not only to each continent as a\r\nwhole, but also to the different regions circumscribed within its\r\nborders. In both, however, the highest mountain-chains, the Rocky\r\nMountains and the Western Coast Range, with their wide intervening\r\ntable-land in North America, and the chain of the Andes, with its lesser\r\nplateaux in South America, run along the western coast; both have a\r\ngreat eastern promontory, Newfoundland in the Northern continent, and\r\nCape St. Roque in the Southern: and though the resemblance between the\r\ninland elevations is perhaps less striking, yet the Canadian range, the\r\nWhite Mountains, and the Alleghanies may very fairly be compared to the\r\ntable-lands of Guiana and Brazil, and the Serra do Mar. Similar\r\ncorrespondences may be traced among the river-systems. The Amazons and\r\nthe St. Lawrence, though so different in dimensions, remind us of each\r\nother by their trend and geographical position; and while the one is fed\r\nby the largest river-system in the world, the other drains the most\r\nextensive lake surfaces known to exist in immediate contiguity. The\r\nOrinoco, with its bay, recalls Hudson’s Bay and its many tributaries,\r\nand the Rio Magdalena may be said to be the South-American Mackenzie;\r\nwhile the Rio de la Plata represents geographically our Mississippi, and\r\nthe Paraguay recalls the Missouri. The Parana may be compared to the\r\nOhio; the Pilcomayo, Vermejo, and Salado rivers, to the river Platte,\r\nthe Arkansas, and the Red River in the United States; while the rivers\r\nfarther south, emptying into the Gulf of Mexico, represent the rivers of\r\nPatagonia and the southern parts of the Argentine Republic. Not only is\r\nthere this general correspondence between the mountain elevations and\r\nthe river-systems, but as the larger river-basins of North America—those\r\nof the St. Lawrence, the Mississippi, and the Mackenzie—meet in the low\r\ntracts extending along the foot of the Rocky Mountains, so do the basins\r\nof the Amazons, the Rio de la Plata, and the Orinoco join each other\r\nalong the eastern slope of the Andes.\r\n\r\nBut while in geographical homology the Amazons compares with the St.\r\nLawrence, and the Mississippi with the Rio de la Plata, the Mississippi\r\nand the Amazons, as has been said, resemble each other in their local\r\ngeological character. They have both received a substratum of cretaceous\r\nbeds, above which are accumulated more recent deposits, so that, in\r\ntheir most prominent geological features, both may be considered as\r\ncretaceous basins, containing extensive deposits of a very recent age.\r\nOf the history of the Amazonian Valley during the periods immediately\r\nfollowing the Cretaceous, we know little or nothing. Whether the\r\nTertiary deposits are hidden under the more modern ones; or whether they\r\nare wholly wanting, the basin having, perhaps, been raised above the\r\nsea-level before that time; or whether they have been swept away by the\r\ntremendous inundations in the valley, which have certainly destroyed a\r\ngreat part of the cretaceous deposit,—they have never been observed in\r\nany part of the Amazonian basin. Whatever Tertiary deposits are\r\nrepresented in geological maps of this region are so marked in\r\nconsequence of an incorrect identification of strata belonging, in fact,\r\nto a much more recent period.\r\n\r\nA minute and extensive survey of the valley of the Amazons is by no\r\nmeans an easy task, and its difficulty is greatly increased by the fact\r\nthat the lower formations are only accessible on the river margins\r\nduring the _vasante_, or dry season, when the waters shrink in their\r\nbeds, leaving a great part of their banks exposed. It happened that the\r\nfirst three or four months of my journey (August, September, October,\r\nand November) were those when the waters are lowest,—reaching their\r\nminimum in September and October, and beginning to rise again in\r\nNovember,—so that I had an excellent opportunity, in ascending the\r\nriver, of observing its geological structure. Throughout its whole\r\nlength, three distinct geological formations may be traced, the two\r\nlower of which have followed in immediate succession, and are\r\nconformable with one another, while the third rests unconformably upon\r\nthem, following all the inequalities of the greatly denudated surface\r\npresented by the second formation. Notwithstanding this seeming\r\ninterruption in the sequence of these deposits, the third, as we shall\r\npresently see, belongs to the same series, and was accumulated in the\r\nsame basin. The lowest set of beds of the whole series is rarely\r\nvisible; but it seems everywhere to consist of sandstone, or even of\r\nloose sands well stratified, the coarser materials lying invariably\r\nbelow, and the finer above. Upon this lower set of beds rests everywhere\r\nan extensive deposit of fine laminated clays, varying in thickness, but\r\nfrequently dividing into layers as thin as a sheet of paper. In some\r\nlocalities they exhibit, in patches, an extraordinary variety of\r\nbeautiful colors,—pink, orange, crimson, yellow, gray, blue, and also\r\nblack and white. It is from these beds that the Indians prepare their\r\npaints. These clay deposits assume occasionally a peculiar appearance,\r\nand one which might mislead the observer as to their true nature. When\r\ntheir surface has been long exposed to the action of the atmosphere and\r\nto the heat of the burning sun, they look so much like clay-slates of\r\nthe oldest geological epochs that, at first sight, I took them for\r\nprimary slates, my attention being attracted to them by a regular\r\ncleavage as distinct as that of the most ancient clay-slates. And yet at\r\nTonantins, on the banks of the Solimoens, in a locality where their\r\nexposed surfaces had this primordial appearance, I found in these very\r\nbeds a considerable amount of well-preserved leaves, the character of\r\nwhich proves their recent origin. These leaves do not even indicate as\r\nancient a period as the Tertiaries, but resemble so closely the\r\nvegetation of to-day that I have no doubt, when examined by competent\r\nauthority, they will be identified with living plants. The presence of\r\nsuch an extensive clay formation, stretching over a surface of more than\r\nthree thousand miles in length and about seven hundred in breadth, is\r\nnot easily explained under any ordinary circumstances. The fact that it\r\nis so thoroughly laminated shows that, in the basin in which it was\r\nformed, the waters must have been unusually quiet, containing identical\r\nmaterials throughout, and that these materials must have been deposited\r\nover the whole bottom in the same way. It is usually separated from the\r\nsuperincumbent beds by a glazed crust of hard, compact sandstone, almost\r\nresembling a ferruginous quartzite.\r\n\r\nUpon this follow beds of sand and sandstone, varying in the regularity\r\nof their strata, reddish in color, often highly ferruginous, and more or\r\nless nodulous or porous. They present frequent traces of\r\ncross-stratification, alternating with regularly stratified horizontal\r\nbeds, with here and there an intervening layer of clay. It would seem as\r\nif the character of the water-basin had now changed, and as if the\r\nwaters under which this second formation was deposited had vibrated\r\nbetween storm and calm, had sometimes flowed more gently, and again had\r\nbeen tossed to and fro, giving to some of the beds the aspect of true\r\ntorrential deposits. Indeed, these sandstone formations present a great\r\nvariety of aspects. Sometimes they are very regularly laminated, or\r\nassume even the appearance of the hardest quartzite. This is usually the\r\ncase with the uppermost beds. In other localities, and more especially\r\nin the lowermost beds, the whole mass is honeycombed, as if drilled by\r\nworms or boring shells, the hard parts enclosing softer sands or clays.\r\nOccasionally the ferruginous materials prevail to such an extent that\r\nsome of these beds might be mistaken for bog-ore, while others contain a\r\nlarge amount of clay, more regularly stratified, and alternating with\r\nstrata of sandstone, thus recalling the most characteristic forms of the\r\nOld Red or Triassic formations. This resemblance has, no doubt, led to\r\nthe identification of the Amazonian deposits with the more ancient\r\nformations of Europe. At Monte Alégre, of which I shall presently speak\r\nmore in detail, such a clay bed divides the lower from the upper\r\nsandstone. The thickness of these sandstones is extremely variable. In\r\nthe basin of the Amazons proper, they hardly rise anywhere above the\r\nlevel of high water during the rainy season; while at low water, in the\r\nsummer months, they may be observed everywhere along the river-banks. It\r\nwill be seen, however, that the limit between high and low water gives\r\nno true measure of the original thickness of the whole series.\r\n\r\nIn the neighborhood of Almeyrim, at a short distance from the northern\r\nbank of the river, and nearly parallel with its course, there rises a\r\nline of low hills, interrupted here and there, but extending in evident\r\nconnection from Almeyrim through the region of Monte Alégre to the\r\nheights of Obydos. These hills have attracted the attention of\r\ntravellers, not only from their height, which appears greater than it\r\nis, because they rise abruptly from an extensive plain, but also on\r\naccount of their curious form; many of them being perfectly level on\r\ntop, like smooth tables, and very abruptly divided from each other by\r\nlow, intervening spaces.[99] Nothing has hitherto been known of the\r\ngeological structure of these hills, but they have been usually\r\nrepresented as the southernmost spurs of the table-land of Guiana. On\r\nascending the river, I felt the greatest curiosity to examine them; but\r\nat the time I was deeply engrossed in studying the distribution of\r\nfishes in the Amazonian waters, and in making large ichthyological\r\ncollections, for which it was very important not to miss the season of\r\nlow water, when the fishes are most easily obtained. I was, therefore,\r\nobliged to leave this most interesting geological problem, and content\r\nmyself with examining the structure of the valley so far as it could be\r\nseen on the river-banks and in the neighborhood of my different\r\ncollecting stations. On my return, however, when my collections were\r\ncompleted, I was free to pursue this investigation, in which Major\r\nCoutinho was as much interested as myself. We determined to select Monte\r\nAlégre as the centre of our exploration, the serra in that region being\r\nhigher than elsewhere. As I was detained by indisposition at Manaos for\r\nsome days at the time we had appointed for the excursion, Major Coutinho\r\npreceded me, and had already made one trip to the serra, with some very\r\ninteresting results, when I joined him, and we took a second journey\r\ntogether. Monte Alégre lies on a side arm of the Amazons, a little off\r\nfrom its main course. This side arm, called the Rio Gurupatuba, is\r\nsimply a channel, running parallel with the Amazons, and cutting through\r\nfrom a higher to a lower point. Its dimensions are, however, greatly\r\nexaggerated in all the maps thus far published, where it is usually made\r\nto appear as a considerable northern tributary of the Amazons. The town\r\nstands on an elevated terrace, separated from the main stream by the Rio\r\nGurupatuba and by an extensive flat, consisting of numerous lakes\r\ndivided from each other by low, alluvial land, and mostly connected by\r\nnarrow channels. To the west of the town this terrace sinks abruptly to\r\na wide sandy plain called the Campos, covered with a low forest-growth,\r\nand bordered on its farther limit by the picturesque serra of Ereré. The\r\nform of this mountain is so abrupt, its rise from the plains so bold and\r\nsudden, that it seems more than twice its real height. Judging by the\r\neye and comparing it with the mountains I had last seen,—the Corcovado,\r\nthe Gavia, and Tijuca range in the neighborhood of Rio,—I had supposed\r\nit to be three or four thousand feet high, and was greatly astonished\r\nwhen our barometric observations showed it to be somewhat less than nine\r\nhundred feet in its most elevated point. This, however, agrees with\r\nMartius’s measurement of the Almeyrim hills, which he says are eight\r\nhundred feet in height.\r\n\r\nWe passed three days in the investigation of the Serra of Ereré, and\r\nfound it to consist wholly of the sandstone deposits already described,\r\nand to have exactly the same geological constitution. In short, the\r\nSerra of Monte Alégre, and of course all those connected with it on the\r\nnorthern side of the river, lie in the prolongation of the lower beds\r\nforming the banks of the river, their greater height being due simply to\r\nthe fact that they have not been worn to the same low level. The\r\nopposite range of Santarem, which has the same general outline and\r\ncharacter, shares, no doubt, the same geological structure. In one word,\r\nall these hills were formerly part of a continuous formation, and owe\r\ntheir present outline and their isolated position to a colossal\r\ndenudation. The surface of the once unbroken strata, which in their\r\noriginal condition must have formed an immense plain covered by water,\r\nhas been cut into ravines or carried away over large tracts, to a\r\ngreater or less depth, leaving only such portions standing as, from\r\ntheir hardness, could resist the floods which swept over it. The\r\nlongitudinal trend of these hills is to be ascribed to the direction of\r\nthe current which caused the denudation, while their level summits are\r\ndue to the regularity of the stratification. They are not all\r\ntable-topped, however; among them are many of smaller size, in which the\r\nsides have been gradually worn down, producing a gently rounded surface.\r\nOf course, under the heavy tropical rains this denudation is still going\r\non, though in a greatly modified form.\r\n\r\nI cannot speak of this Serra without alluding to the great beauty and\r\nextraordinary extent of the view to be obtained from it. Indeed, it was\r\nhere that for the first time the geography of the country presented\r\nitself to my mind as a living reality in all its completeness.\r\nInsignificant as is its actual height, the Serra of Ereré commands a\r\nwider prospect than is to be had from many a more imposing mountain; for\r\nthe surrounding plain, covered with forests and ploughed by countless\r\nrivers, stretches away for hundreds of leagues in every direction,\r\nwithout any object to obstruct the view. Standing on the brow of the\r\nSerra, with the numerous lakes intersecting the lowlands at its base,\r\nyou look across the valley of the Amazons, as far as the eye can reach,\r\nand through its centre you follow for miles on either side the broad\r\nflood of the great river, carrying its yellow waters to the sea. As I\r\nstood there, panoramas from the Swiss mountains came up to my memory,\r\nand I fancied myself on the Alps, looking across the plain of\r\nSwitzerland instead of the bed of the Amazons; the distant line of the\r\nSantarem hills on the southern bank of the river, and lower than the\r\nnorthern chain, representing the Jura range. As if to complete the\r\ncomparison, Alpine lichens were growing among the cacti and palms, and a\r\ncrust of Arctic cryptogamous growth covered rocks, between which sprang\r\ntropical flowers. On the northern flank of this Serra I found the only\r\ngenuine erratic boulders I have seen in the whole length of the\r\nAmazonian Valley from Pará to the frontier of Peru, though there are\r\nmany detached masses of rock, as, for instance, at Pedreira, near the\r\njunction of the Rio Negro and Rio Branco, which might be mistaken for\r\nthem, but are due to the decomposition of the rocks in place. The\r\nboulders of Ereré are entirely distinct from the rock of the Serra, and\r\nconsist of masses of compact hornblende.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that these two ranges skirting a part of the northern and\r\nsouthern banks of the Lower Amazons are not the only remnants of this\r\narenaceous formation in its primitive altitude. On the banks of the Rio\r\nJapura, in the Serra of Cupati, Major Coutinho has found the same beds\r\nrising to the same height. It thus appears, by positive evidence, that\r\nover an extent of a thousand miles these deposits had a very\r\nconsiderable thickness, in the present direction of the valley. How far\r\nthey extended in width has not been ascertained by direct observation;\r\nfor we have not seen how they sink away to the northward, and towards\r\nthe south the denudation has been so complete that, except in the very\r\nlow range of hills in the neighborhood of Santarem, they do not rise\r\nabove the plain. But the fact that this formation once had a thickness\r\nof more than eight hundred feet within the limits where we have had an\r\nopportunity of observing it, leaves no doubt that it must have extended\r\nto the edge of the basin, filling it to the same height throughout its\r\nwhole extent. The thickness of the deposits gives a measure for the\r\ncolossal scale of the denudations by which this immense accumulation was\r\nreduced to its present level. Here, then, is a system of high hills,\r\nhaving the prominence of mountains in the landscape, produced by causes\r\nto whose agency inequalities on the earth’s surface of this magnitude\r\nhave never yet been ascribed. We may fairly call them denudation\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\nAt this stage of the inquiry we have to account for two remarkable\r\nphenomena,—first, the filling of the Amazonian bottom with coarse\r\narenaceous materials and finely laminated clays, immediately followed by\r\nsandstones rising to a height of more than eight hundred feet above the\r\nsea, the basin meanwhile having no rocky barrier towards the ocean on\r\nits eastern side; secondly, the wearing away and reduction of these\r\nformations to their present level by a denudation more extensive than\r\nany thus far recorded in the annals of geology, which has given rise to\r\nall the most prominent hills and mountain-chains along the northern bank\r\nof the river. Before seeking an explanation of these facts, let us look\r\nat the third and uppermost deposit.\r\n\r\nThis deposit is essentially the same as the Rio drift; but in the north\r\nit presents itself under a somewhat different aspect. As in Rio, it is a\r\nclayey deposit, containing more or less sand, and reddish in color,\r\nthough varying from deep ochre to a brownish tint. It is not so\r\nabsolutely destitute of stratification here as in its more southern\r\nrange, though the traces of stratification are rare, and, when they do\r\noccur, are faint and indistinct. The materials are also more completely\r\ncomminuted, and, as I said above, contain hardly any large masses,\r\nthough quartz pebbles are sometimes scattered throughout the deposit,\r\nand occasionally a thin seam of pebbles, exactly as in the Rio drift, is\r\nseen resting between it and the underlying sandstone. In some places\r\nthis bed of pebbles intersects even the mass of the clay, giving it, in\r\nsuch instances, an unquestionably stratified character. There can be no\r\ndoubt that this more recent formation rests unconformably upon the\r\nsandstone beds beneath it; for it fills all the inequalities of their\r\ndenudated surfaces, whether they be more or less limited furrows, or\r\nwide, undulating depressions. It may be seen everywhere along the banks\r\nof the river, above the stratified sandstone, sometimes with the\r\nriver-mud accumulated against it; at the season of the _enchente_, or\r\nhigh water, it is the only formation left exposed above the water-level.\r\nIts thickness is not great; it varies from twenty or thirty to fifty\r\nfeet, and may occasionally rise nearly to a hundred feet in height,\r\nthough this is rarely the case. It is evident that this formation also\r\nwas once continuous, stretching over the whole basin at one level.\r\nThough it is now worn down in many places, and has wholly disappeared in\r\nothers, its connection may be readily traced; since it is everywhere\r\nvisible, not only on opposite banks of the Amazons, but also on those of\r\nall its tributaries, as far as their shores have been examined. I have\r\nsaid that it rests always above the sandstone beds. This is true, with\r\none exception. Wherever the sandstone deposits retain their original\r\nthickness, as in the hills of Monte Alégre and Almeyrim, the red clay is\r\nnot found on their summits, but occurs only in their ravines and\r\nhollows, or resting against their sides. This shows that it is not only\r\nposterior to the sandstone, but was accumulated in a shallower basin,\r\nand consequently never reached so high a level. The boulders of Ereré do\r\nnot rest on the stratified sandstone of the Serra, but are sunk in the\r\nunstratified mass of the clay. This should be remembered, as it will\r\npresently be seen that their position associates them with a later\r\nperiod than that of the mountain itself. The unconformability of the\r\nochraceous clay and the underlying sandstones might lead to the idea\r\nthat the two formations belong to distinct geological periods, and are\r\nnot due to the same agency acting at successive times. One feature,\r\nhowever, shows their close connection. The ochraceous clay exhibits a\r\nremarkable identity of configuration with the underlying sandstones. An\r\nextensive survey of the two, in their mutual relations, shows clearly\r\nthat they were both deposited by the same water-system within the same\r\nbasin, but at different levels. Here and there the clay formation has so\r\npale and grayish a tint that it may be confounded with the mud deposits\r\nof the river. These latter, however, never rise so high as the\r\nochraceous clay, but are everywhere confined within the limits of high\r\nand low water. The islands also, in the main course of the Amazons,\r\nconsist invariably of river-mud; while those arising from the\r\nintersection and cutting off of portions of the land by diverging\r\nbranches of the main stream always consist of the well-known sandstones,\r\ncapped by the ochre-colored clay.\r\n\r\nIt may truly be said that there does not exist on the surface of the\r\nearth a formation known to geologists resembling that of the Amazons.\r\nIts extent is stupendous; it stretches from the Atlantic shore, through\r\nthe whole width of Brazil, into Peru, to the very foot of the Andes.\r\nHumboldt speaks of it “in the vast plains of the Amazons, in the eastern\r\nboundary of Jaen de Bracamoros,” and says, “This prodigious extension of\r\nred sandstone in the low grounds stretching along the east of the Andes\r\nis one of the most striking phenomena I observed during my examination\r\nof rocks in the equinoctial regions.”[100] When the great natural\r\nphilosopher wrote these lines, he had no idea how much these deposits\r\nextended beyond the field of his observations. Indeed, they are not\r\nlimited to the main bed of the Amazons; they have been followed along\r\nthe banks of its tributaries to the south and north as far as these have\r\nbeen ascended. They occur on the margins of the Huallaga and the\r\nUcayale, on those of the Iça, the Hyutahy, the Hyurua, the Hyapura, and\r\nthe Purus. On the banks of the Hyapura, where Major Coutinho has traced\r\nthem, they are found as far as the Cataract of Cupati. I have followed\r\nthem along the Rio Negro to its junction with the Rio Branco; and\r\nHumboldt not only describes them from a higher point on this same river,\r\nbut also from the valley of the Orinoco. Finally, they may be tracked\r\nalong the banks of the Madeira, the Tapajos, the Xingu, and the\r\nTocantins, as well as on the shores of the Guatuma, the Trombetas, and\r\nother northern affluents of the Amazons. The observations of Martius,\r\nthose of Gardner, and the recent survey above alluded to, made by my\r\nassistant, Mr. St. John, of the valley of the Rio Guruguea and that of\r\nthe Rio Paranahyba, show that the great basin of Piauhy is also\r\nidentical in its geological structure with the lateral valleys of the\r\nAmazons. The same is true of the large island of Marajo, lying at the\r\nmouth of the Amazons. And yet I believe that even this does not cover\r\nthe whole ground, and that some future writer may say of my estimate, as\r\nI have said of Humboldt’s, that it falls short of the truth; for, if my\r\ngeneralizations are correct, the same formation will be found extending\r\nover the whole basin of the Paraguay and the Rio de la Plata, and along\r\ntheir tributaries, to the very heart of the Andes.\r\n\r\nSuch are the facts. The question now arises, How were these vast\r\ndeposits formed? The easiest answer, and the one which most readily\r\nsuggests itself, is that of a submersion of the continent at successive\r\nperiods, to allow the accumulation of these materials, and its\r\nsubsequent elevation. I reject this explanation for the simple reason\r\nthat the deposits show no sign whatever of a marine origin. No\r\nsea-shells, nor remains of any marine animal, have as yet been found\r\nthroughout their whole extent, over a region several thousand miles in\r\nlength and from five to seven hundred miles in width. It is contrary to\r\nall our knowledge of geological deposits to suppose that an ocean basin\r\nof this size, which must have been submerged during an immensely long\r\nperiod in order to accumulate formations of such a thickness, should not\r\ncontain numerous remains of the animals formerly inhabiting it.[101] The\r\nonly fossil remains of any kind truly belonging to it, which I have\r\nfound in the formation, are leaves taken from the lower clays on the\r\nbanks of the Solimoens at Tonantins; and these show a vegetation similar\r\nin general character to that which prevails there to-day. Evidently,\r\nthen, this basin was a fresh-water basin; these deposits are fresh-water\r\ndeposits. But as the valley of the Amazons exists to-day, it is widely\r\nopen to the ocean on the east, with a gentle slope from the Andes to the\r\nAtlantic, determining a powerful seaward current. When these vast\r\naccumulations took place, the basin must have been closed; otherwise the\r\nloose materials would constantly have been carried down to the ocean.\r\n\r\nIt is my belief that all these deposits belong to the ice-period in its\r\nearlier or later phases, and to this cosmic winter, which, judging from\r\nall the phenomena connected with it, may have lasted for thousands of\r\ncenturies, we must look for the key to the geological history of the\r\nAmazonian Valley. I am aware that this suggestion will appear\r\nextravagant. But is it, after all, so improbable that, when Central\r\nEurope was covered with ice thousands of feet thick; when the glaciers\r\nof Great Britain ploughed into the sea, and when those of the Swiss\r\nmountains had ten times their present altitude; when every lake in\r\nNorthern Italy was filled with ice, and these frozen masses extended\r\neven into Northern Africa; when a sheet of ice, reaching nearly to the\r\nsummit of Mount Washington in the White Mountains (that is, having a\r\nthickness of nearly six thousand feet), moved over the continent of\r\nNorth America,—is it so improbable that, in this epoch of universal\r\ncold, the valley of the Amazons also had its glacier poured down into it\r\nfrom the accumulations of snow in the Cordilleras, and swollen laterally\r\nby the tributary glaciers descending from the table-lands of Guiana and\r\nBrazil? The movement of this immense glacier must have been eastward,\r\ndetermined as well by the vast reservoirs of snow in the Andes as by the\r\ndirection of the valley itself. It must have ploughed the valley-bottom\r\nover and over again, grinding all the materials beneath it into a fine\r\npowder or reducing them to small pebbles, and it must have accumulated\r\nat its lower end a moraine of proportions as gigantic as its own; thus\r\nbuilding a colossal sea-wall across the mouth of the valley. I shall be\r\nasked at once whether I have found here also the glacial\r\ninscriptions,—the furrows, striæ, and polished surfaces so\r\ncharacteristic of the ground over which glaciers have travelled. I\r\nanswer, not a trace of them; for the simple reason that there is not a\r\nnatural rock-surface to be found throughout the whole Amazonian Valley.\r\nThe rocks themselves are of so friable a nature, and the decomposition\r\ncaused by the warm torrential rains and by exposure to the burning sun\r\nof the tropics so great and unceasing, that it is hopeless to look for\r\nmarks which in colder climates and on harder substances are preserved\r\nthrough ages unchanged. With the exception of the rounded surfaces so\r\nwell known in Switzerland as the _roches moutonnées_ heretofore alluded\r\nto, which may be seen in many localities, and the boulders of Ereré, the\r\ndirect traces of glaciers as seen in other countries are wanting in\r\nBrazil. I am, indeed, quite willing to admit that, from the nature of\r\nthe circumstances, I have not here the positive evidence which has\r\nguided me in my previous glacial investigations. My conviction in this\r\ninstance is founded, first, on the materials in the Amazonian Valley,\r\nwhich correspond exactly in their character to materials accumulated in\r\nglacier bottoms; secondly, on the resemblance of the upper or third\r\nAmazonian formation to the Rio drift,[102] of the glacial origin of\r\nwhich there cannot, in my opinion, be any doubt; thirdly, on the fact\r\nthat this fresh-water basin must have been closed against the sea by\r\nsome powerful barrier, the removal of which would naturally give an\r\noutlet to the waters, and cause the extraordinary denudations, the\r\nevidences of which meet us everywhere throughout the valley.\r\n\r\nOn a smaller scale, phenomena of this kind have long been familiar to\r\nus. In the present lakes of Northern Italy, in those of Switzerland,\r\nNorway, and Sweden, as well as in those of New England, especially in\r\nthe State of Maine, the waters are held back in their basins by\r\nmoraines. In the ice-period these depressions were filled with glaciers,\r\nwhich, in the course of time, accumulated at their lower end a wall of\r\nloose materials. These walls still remain, and serve as dams to prevent\r\nthe escape of the waters. But for their moraines, all these lakes would\r\nbe open valleys. In the Roads of Glen Roy, in Scotland, we have an\r\ninstance of a fresh-water lake, which has now wholly disappeared, formed\r\nin the same manner, and reduced successively to lower and lower levels\r\nby the breaking down or wearing away of the moraines which originally\r\nprevented its waters from flowing out. Assuming then that, under the low\r\ntemperature of the ice-period, the climatic conditions necessary for the\r\nformation of land-ice existed in the valley of the Amazons, and that it\r\nwas actually filled with an immense glacier, it follows that, when these\r\nfields of ice yielded to a gradual change of climate, and slowly melted\r\naway, the whole basin, then closed against the sea by a huge wall of\r\n_débris_, was transformed into a vast fresh-water lake. The first effect\r\nof the thawing process must have been to separate the glacier from its\r\nfoundation, raising it from immediate contact with the valley bottom,\r\nand thus giving room for the accumulation of a certain amount of water\r\nbeneath it; while the valley as a whole would still be occupied by the\r\nglacier. In this shallow sheet of water under the ice, and protected by\r\nit from any violent disturbance, those finer triturated materials always\r\nfound at a glacier bottom, and ground sometimes to powder by its action,\r\nwould be deposited, and gradually transformed from an unstratified paste\r\ncontaining the finest sand and mud, together with coarse pebbles and\r\ngravel, into a regularly stratified formation. In this formation the\r\ncoarse materials would of course fall to the bottom, while the most\r\nminute would settle above them. It is at this time and under such\r\ncircumstances that I believe the first formation of the Amazonian\r\nValley, with the coarse, pebbly sand beneath, and the finely laminated\r\nclays above, to have been accumulated.\r\n\r\nI shall perhaps be reminded here of my fossil leaves, and asked how any\r\nvegetation would be possible under such circumstances. But it must be\r\nremembered, that, in considering all these periods, we must allow for\r\nimmense lapses of time and for very gradual changes; that the close of\r\nthis first period would be very different from its beginning; and that a\r\nrich vegetation springs on the very borders of the snow and ice fields\r\nin Switzerland. The fact that these were accumulated in a glacial basin\r\nwould, indeed, at once account for the traces of vegetable life, and for\r\nthe absence, or at least the great scarcity, of animal remains in these\r\ndeposits. For while fruits may ripen and flowers bloom on the very edge\r\nof the glaciers, it is also well known that the fresh-water lakes formed\r\nby the melting of the ice are singularly deficient in life. There are,\r\nindeed, hardly any animals to be found in glacial lakes.\r\n\r\nThe second formation belongs to a later period, when, the whole body of\r\nice being more or less disintegrated, the basin contained a larger\r\nquantity of water. Beside that arising from the melting of the ice, this\r\nimmense valley bottom must have received, then as now, all which was\r\ncondensed from the atmosphere above, and poured into it in the form of\r\nrain or dew at present. Thus an amount of water equal to that flowing in\r\nfrom all the tributaries of the main stream must have been rushing\r\ntowards the axis of the valley, seeking its natural level, but spreading\r\nover a more extensive surface than now, until, finally gathered up as\r\nseparate rivers, it flowed in distinct beds. In its general movement\r\ntoward the central and lower part of the valley, the broad stream would\r\ncarry along all the materials small enough to be so transported, as well\r\nas those so minute as to remain suspended in the waters. It would\r\ngradually deposit them in the valley bottom in horizontal beds more or\r\nless regular, or here and there, wherever eddies gave rise to more rapid\r\nand irregular currents, characterized by torrential stratification. Thus\r\nhas been consolidated in the course of ages the continuous sand\r\nformation spreading over the whole Amazonian basin, and attaining a\r\nthickness of eight hundred feet.\r\n\r\nWhile these accumulations were taking place within this basin, it must\r\nnot be forgotten that the sea was beating against its outer\r\nwall,—against that gigantic moraine which I suppose to have closed it at\r\nits eastern end. It would seem that, either from this cause, or perhaps\r\nin consequence of some turbulent action from within, a break was made in\r\nthis defence, and the waters rushed violently out. It is very possible\r\nthat the waters, gradually swollen at the close of this period by the\r\nfurther melting of the ice, by the additions poured in from lateral\r\ntributaries, by the rains, and also by the filling of the basin with\r\nloose materials, would overflow, and thus contribute to destroy the\r\nmoraine. However this may be, it follows from my premises that, in the\r\nend, these waters obtained a sudden release, and poured seaward with a\r\nviolence which cut and denuded the deposits already formed, wearing them\r\ndown to a much lower level, and leaving only a few remnants standing out\r\nin their original thickness, where the strata were solid enough to\r\nresist the action of the currents. Such are the hills of Monte Alégre,\r\nof Obydos, Almeyrim, and Cupati, as well as the lower ridges of\r\nSantarem. This escape of the waters did not, however, entirely empty the\r\nwhole basin; for the period of denudation was again followed by one of\r\nquiet accumulation, during which was deposited the ochraceous sandy clay\r\nresting upon the denudated surfaces of the underlying sandstone. To this\r\nperiod I refer the boulders of Ereré, sunk as they are in the clay of\r\nthis final deposit. I suppose them to have been brought to their present\r\nposition by floating ice at the close of the glacial period, when\r\nnothing remained of the ice-fields except such isolated\r\nmasses,—ice-rafts as it were; or perhaps by icebergs dropped into the\r\nbasin from glaciers still remaining in the Andes and on the edges of the\r\nplateaus of Guiana and Brazil. From the general absence of\r\nstratification in this clay formation, it would seem that the\r\ncomparatively shallow sheet of water in which it was deposited was very\r\ntranquil. Indeed, after the waters had sunk much below the level which\r\nthey held during the deposition of the sandstone, and the currents which\r\ngave rise to the denudation of the latter had ceased, the whole sheet of\r\nwater would naturally become much more placid. But the time arrived when\r\nthe water broke through its boundaries again, perhaps owing to the\r\nfurther encroachment of the sea and consequent destruction of the\r\nmoraine.[103] In this second drainage, however, the waters, carrying\r\naway a considerable part of the new deposit, furrowing it to its very\r\nfoundation, and even cutting through it into the underlying sandstone,\r\nwere, in the end, reduced to something like their present level, and\r\nconfined within their present beds. This is shown by the fact that in\r\nthis ochre-colored clay, and penetrating to a greater or less depth the\r\nsandstone below, are dug, not only the great longitudinal channel of the\r\nAmazons itself, but also the lateral furrows through which its\r\ntributaries reach the main stream, and the network of anastomosing\r\nbranches flowing between them; the whole forming the most extraordinary\r\nriver system in the world.\r\n\r\nMy assumption that the sea has produced very extensive changes in the\r\ncoast of Brazil—changes more than sufficient to account for the\r\ndisappearance of the glacial wall which I suppose to have closed the\r\nAmazonian Valley in the ice period—is by no means hypothetical. This\r\naction is still going on to a remarkable degree, and is even now rapidly\r\nmodifying the outline of the shore. When I first arrived at Pará, I was\r\nstruck with the fact that the Amazons, the largest river in the world,\r\nhas no delta. All the other rivers which we call great, though some of\r\nthem are insignificant as compared with the Amazons,—the Mississippi,\r\nthe Nile, the Ganges, and the Danube,—deposit extensive deltas, and the\r\nsmaller rivers also, with few exceptions, are constantly building up the\r\nland at their mouths by the materials they bring along with them. Even\r\nthe little river Kander, emptying into the lake of Thun, is not without\r\nits delta. Since my return from the Upper Amazons to Pará, I have made\r\nan examination of some of the harbor islands, and also of parts of the\r\ncoast, and have satisfied myself that, with the exception of a few\r\nsmall, low islands, never rising above the sea-level, and composed of\r\nalluvial deposit, they are portions of the main-land detached from it,\r\npartly by the action of the river itself, and partly by the encroachment\r\nof the ocean. In fact, the sea is eating away the land much faster than\r\nthe river can build it up. The great island of Marajo was originally a\r\ncontinuation of the valley of the Amazons, and is identical with it in\r\nevery detail of its geological structure. My investigation of the island\r\nitself, in connection with the coast and the river, leads me to suppose\r\nthat, having been at one time an integral part of the deposits described\r\nabove, at a later period it became an island in the bed of the Amazons,\r\nwhich, dividing in two arms, encircled it completely, and then, joining\r\nagain to form a single stream, flowed onward to the sea-shore, which in\r\nthose days lay much farther to the eastward than it now does. I suppose\r\nthe position of the island of Marajo at that time to have corresponded\r\nvery nearly to the present position of the island of Tupinambaranas,\r\njust at the junction of the Madeira with the Amazons. It is a question\r\namong geographers whether the Tocantins is a branch of the Amazons, or\r\nshould be considered as forming an independent river system. It will be\r\nseen that, if my view is correct, it must formerly have borne the same\r\nrelation to the Amazons that the Madeira River now does, joining it just\r\nwhere Marajo divided the main stream, as the Madeira now joins it at the\r\nhead of the island of Tupinambaranas. If in countless centuries to come\r\nthe ocean should continue to eat its way into the Valley of the Amazons,\r\nonce more transforming the lower part of the basin into a gulf, as it\r\nwas during the cretaceous period, the time might arrive when\r\ngeographers, finding the Madeira emptying almost immediately into the\r\nsea, would ask themselves whether it had ever been indeed a branch of\r\nthe Amazons, just as they now question whether the Tocantins is a\r\ntributary of the main stream or an independent river. But to return to\r\nMarajo, and to the facts actually in our possession.\r\n\r\nThe island is intersected, in its southeastern end, by a considerable\r\nriver called the Igarapé Grande. The cut made through the land by this\r\nstream seems intended to serve as a geological section, so perfectly\r\ndoes it display the three characteristic Amazonian formations above\r\ndescribed. At its mouth, near the town of Souré, and at Salvaterra, on\r\nthe opposite bank, may be seen, lowest, the well-stratified sandstone,\r\nwith the finely laminated clays resting upon it, overtopped by a crust;\r\nthen the cross-stratified, highly ferruginous sandstone, with quartz\r\npebbles here and there; and, above all, the well-known ochraceous,\r\nunstratified sandy clay, spreading over the undulating surface of the\r\ndenudated sandstone, following all its inequalities, and filling all its\r\ndepressions and furrows. But while the Igarapé Grande has dug its\r\nchannel down to the sea, cutting these formations, as I ascertained, to\r\na depth of twenty-five fathoms, it has thus opened the way for the\r\nencroachments of the tides, and the ocean is now, in its turn, gaining\r\nupon the land. Were there no other evidence of the action of the tides\r\nin this locality, the steep cut of the Igarapé Grande, contrasting with\r\nthe gentle slope of the banks near its mouth, wherever they have been\r\nmodified by the invasion of the sea, would enable us to distinguish the\r\nwork of the river from that of the ocean, and to prove that the\r\ndenudation now going on is due in part to both. But besides this, I was\r\nso fortunate as to discover, on my recent excursion, unmistakable and\r\nperfectly convincing evidence of the onward movement of the sea. At the\r\nmouth of the Igarapé Grande, both at Souré and at Salvaterra, on the\r\nsouthern side of the Igarapé, is a submerged forest. Evidently this\r\nforest grew in one of those marshy lands constantly inundated, for\r\nbetween the stumps is accumulated the loose, felt-like peat\r\ncharacteristic of such grounds, and containing about as much mud as\r\nvegetable matter. Such a marshy forest, with the stumps of the trees\r\nstill standing erect in the peat, has been laid bare on both sides of\r\nthe Igarapé Grande by the encroachments of the ocean. That this is the\r\nwork of the sea is undeniable, for all the little depressions and\r\nindentations of the peat are filled with sea-sand, and a ridge of tidal\r\nsand divides it from the forest still standing behind. Nor is this all.\r\nAt Vigia, immediately opposite to Souré, on the continental side of the\r\nPará River, just where it meets the sea, we have the counterpart of this\r\nsubmerged forest. Another peat-bog, with the stumps of innumerable trees\r\nstanding in it, and encroached upon in the same way by tidal sand, is\r\nexposed here also. No doubt these forests were once all continuous, and\r\nstretched across the whole basin of what is now called the Pará River.\r\n\r\nSince I have been pursuing this inquiry, I have gathered much\r\ninformation to the same effect from persons living on the coast. It is\r\nwell remembered that, twenty years ago, there existed an island, more\r\nthan a mile in width, to the northeast of the entrance of the Bay of\r\nVigia, which has now entirely disappeared. Farther eastward, the Bay of\r\nBraganza has doubled its width in the last twenty years, and on the\r\nshore, within the bay, the sea has gained upon the land for a distance\r\nof two hundred yards during a period of only ten years. The latter fact\r\nis ascertained by the position of some houses, which were two hundred\r\nyards farther from the sea ten years ago than they now are. From these\r\nand the like reports, from my own observations on this part of the\r\nBrazilian coast, from some investigations made by Major Coutinho at the\r\nmouth of the Amazons on its northern continental shore near Macapa, and\r\nfrom the reports of Mr. St. John respecting the formations in the valley\r\nof the Paranahyba, it is my belief that the changes I have been\r\ndescribing are but a small part of the destruction wrought by the sea on\r\nthe north-eastern shore of this continent. I think it will be found,\r\nwhen the coast has been fully surveyed, that a strip of land not less\r\nthan a hundred leagues in width, stretching from Cape St. Roque to the\r\nnorthern extremity of South America, has been eaten away by the ocean.\r\nIf this be so, the Paranahyba and the rivers to the northwest of it, in\r\nthe province of Maranham, were formerly tributaries of the Amazons; and\r\nall that we know thus far of their geological character goes to prove\r\nthat this was actually the case. Such an extensive oceanic denudation\r\nmust have carried away not only the gigantic glacial moraine here\r\nassumed to have closed the mouth of the Amazonian basin, but the very\r\nground on which it formerly stood. Although the terminal moraine has\r\ndisappeared, there is, however, no reason why parts of the lateral\r\nmoraines should not remain. And I expect in my approaching visit to\r\nCeará to find traces of the southern lateral moraine in that\r\nneighborhood.\r\n\r\nDuring the last four or five years I have been engaged in a series of\r\ninvestigations, in the United States, upon the subject of the\r\ndenudations connected with the close of the glacial period there, and\r\nthe encroachments of the ocean upon the drift deposits along the\r\nAtlantic coast. Had these investigations been published in detail, with\r\nthe necessary maps, it would have been far easier for me to explain the\r\nfacts I have lately observed in the Amazonian Valley, to connect them\r\nwith facts of a like character on the continent of North America, and to\r\nshow how remarkably they correspond with facts accomplished during the\r\nsame period in other parts of the world. While the glacial epoch itself\r\nhas been very extensively studied in the last half-century, little\r\nattention has been paid to the results connected with the breaking up of\r\nthe geological winter and the final disappearance of the ice. I believe\r\nthat the true explanation of the presence of a large part of the\r\nsuperficial deposits lately ascribed to the agency of the sea, during\r\ntemporary subsidences of the land, will be found in the melting of the\r\nice-fields. To this cause I would refer all those deposits which I have\r\ndesignated as remodelled drift. When the sheet of ice, extending from\r\nthe Arctic regions over a great part of North America and coming down to\r\nthe sea, slowly melted away, the waters were not distributed over the\r\nface of the country as they now are. They rested upon the bottom\r\ndeposits of the ice-fields, upon the glacial paste, consisting of clay,\r\nsand, pebbles, boulders, etc., underlying the ice. This bottom deposit\r\ndid not, of course, present an even surface, but must have had extensive\r\nundulations and depressions. After the waters had been drained off from\r\nthe more elevated ridges, these depressions would still remain full. In\r\nthe lakes and pools thus formed, stratified deposits would be\r\naccumulated, consisting of the most minutely comminuted clay, deposited\r\nin thin laminated layers, or sometimes in considerable masses, without\r\nany sign of stratification; such differences in the formation being\r\ndetermined by the state of the water, whether perfectly stagnant or more\r\nor less agitated. Of such pool deposits overlying the drift there are\r\nmany instances in the Northern United States. By the overflowing of some\r\nof these lakes, and by the emptying of the higher ones into those on a\r\nlower level, channels would gradually be formed between the depressions.\r\nSo began to be marked out our independent river-systems,—the waters\r\nalways seeking their natural level, gradually widening and deepening the\r\nchannels in which they flowed, as they worked their way down to the sea.\r\nWhen they reached the shore, there followed that antagonism between the\r\nrush of the rivers and the action of the tides,—between continental\r\noutflows and oceanic encroachments,—which still goes on, and has led to\r\nthe formation of our Eastern rivers, with their wide, open estuaries,\r\nsuch as the James, the Potomac, and the Delaware. All these estuaries\r\nare embanked by drift, as are also, in their lower course, the rivers\r\nconnected with them. Where the country was low and flat, and the drift\r\nextended far into the ocean, the encroachment of the sea gave rise, not\r\nonly to our large estuaries, but also to the sounds and deep bays\r\nforming the most prominent indentations of the continental coast, such\r\nas the Bay of Fundy, Massachusetts Bay, Long Island Sound, and others.\r\nThe unmistakable traces of glacial action upon all the islands along the\r\ncoast of New England, sometimes lying at a very considerable distance\r\nfrom the main-land, give an approximate, though a minimum, measure of\r\nthe former extent of the glacial drift seaward, and the subsequent\r\nadvance of the ocean upon the land. Like those of the harbor of Pará,\r\nall these islands have the same geological structure as the continent,\r\nand were evidently continuous with it at some former period. All the\r\nrocky islands along the coast of Maine and Massachusetts exhibit the\r\nglacial traces wherever their surfaces are exposed by the washing away\r\nof the drift; and where the drift remains, its character shows that it\r\nwas once continuous from one island to another, and from all the islands\r\nto the main-land.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to determine with precision the ancient limit of the\r\nglacial drift, but I think it can be shown that it connected the shoals\r\nof Newfoundland with the continent; that Nantucket, Martha’s Vineyard,\r\nand Long Island made part of the main-land; that, in like manner Nova\r\nScotia, including Sable Island, was united to the southern shore of New\r\nBrunswick and Maine, and that the same sheet of drift extended thence to\r\nCape Cod, and stretched southward as far as Cape Hatteras;—in short,\r\nthat the line of shallow soundings along the whole coast of the United\r\nStates marks the former extent of glacial drift. The ocean has gradually\r\neaten its way into this deposit, and given its present outlines to the\r\ncontinent. These denudations of the sea no doubt began as soon as the\r\nbreaking up of the ice exposed the drift to its invasion; in other\r\nwords, at a time when colossal glaciers still poured forth their load of\r\nice into the Atlantic, and fleets of icebergs, far larger and more\r\nnumerous than those now floated off from the Arctic seas, were launched\r\nfrom the north-eastern shore of the United States. Many such masses must\r\nhave stranded along the shore, and have left various signs of their\r\npresence. In fact, the glacial phenomena of the United States and\r\nelsewhere are due to two distinct periods: the first of these was the\r\nglacial epoch proper, when the ice was a solid sheet; while to the\r\nsecond belongs the breaking up of this epoch, with the gradual\r\ndisintegration and dispersion of the ice. We talk of the theory of\r\nglaciers and the theory of icebergs in reference to these phenomena, as\r\nif they were exclusively due to one or the other, and whoever accepted\r\nthe former must reject the latter, and _vice versa_. When geologists\r\nhave combined these now discordant elements, and consider these two\r\nperiods as consecutive,—part of the phenomena being due to the glaciers,\r\npart to the icebergs and to freshets consequent on their breaking\r\nup,—they will find that they have covered the whole ground, and that the\r\ntwo theories are perfectly consistent with each other. I think the\r\npresent disputes upon this subject will end somewhat like those which\r\ndivided the Neptunic and Plutonic schools of geologists in the early\r\npart of this century; the former of whom would have it that all the\r\nrocks were due to the action of water, the latter that they were wholly\r\ndue to the action of fire. The problem was solved, and harmony restored,\r\nwhen it was found that both elements have been equally at work in\r\nforming the solid crust of the globe. To the stranded icebergs alluded\r\nto above, I have no doubt, is to be referred the origin of the many\r\nlakes without outlets existing all over the sandy tract along our coast,\r\nof which Cape Cod forms a part. Not only the formation of these lakes,\r\nbut also that of our salt marshes and cranberry-fields, I believe to be\r\nconnected with the waning of the ice period.\r\n\r\nI hope at some future time to publish in detail, with the appropriate\r\nmaps and illustrations, my observations upon the changes of our coast,\r\nand other phenomena connected with the close of the glacial epoch in the\r\nUnited States. To give results without an account of the investigations\r\nwhich have led to them, inverts the true method of science; and I should\r\nnot have introduced the subject here except to show that the fresh-water\r\ndenudations and the oceanic encroachments which have formed the\r\nAmazonian Valley, with its river system, are not isolated facts, but\r\nthat the process has been the same in both continents. The extraordinary\r\ncontinuity and uniformity of the Amazonian deposits are due to the\r\nimmense size of the basin enclosed, and the identity of the materials\r\ncontained in it.\r\n\r\nA glance at any geological map of the world will show the reader that\r\nthe Valley of the Amazons, so far as an attempt is made to explain its\r\nstructure, is represented as containing isolated tracts of Devonian,\r\nTriassic, Jurassic, cretaceous, tertiary, and alluvial deposits. This is\r\nwholly inaccurate, as is shown by the above sketch, and whatever may be\r\nthought of my interpretation of the actual phenomena, I trust that, in\r\npresenting for the first time the formations of the Amazonian basin in\r\ntheir natural connection and sequence, as consisting of three uniform\r\nsets of comparatively recent deposits, extending throughout the whole\r\nvalley, the investigations here recorded have contributed something to\r\nthe results of modern geology.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 96:\r\n\r\n  See Chapter III. p. 86.\r\n\r\nFootnote 97:\r\n\r\n  The name consecrated by De Saussure to designate certain rocks in\r\n  Switzerland which have had their surfaces rounded under the action of\r\n  the glaciers. Their gently swelling outlines are thought to resemble\r\n  sheep resting on the ground, and for this reason the people in the\r\n  Alps call them _roches moutonnées_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 98:\r\n\r\n  See “Glacial Phenomena in Maine,” Atlantic Monthly, 1866.\r\n\r\nFootnote 99:\r\n\r\n  The atlas in Martius’s “Journey to Brazil,” or the sketch accompanying\r\n  Bates’s description of these hills in his “Naturalist on the Amazons,”\r\n  will give an idea of their aspect.\r\n\r\nFootnote 100:\r\n\r\n  Bohn’s edition of Humboldt’s Personal Narrative, Chap. II. p. 134.\r\n  Humboldt alludes to these formations repeatedly: it is true that he\r\n  refers them to the ancient conglomerates of the Devonian age, but his\r\n  description agrees so perfectly with what I have observed along the\r\n  banks of the Amazons and the Rio Negro that there can be no doubt he\r\n  speaks of the same thing. He wrote at a time when many of the results\r\n  of modern geology were unknown, and his explanation of the phenomena\r\n  was then perfectly natural. The passage from which the few lines in\r\n  the text are taken shows that these deposits extend even to the\r\n  Llanos.\r\n\r\nFootnote 101:\r\n\r\n  I am aware that Bates mentions having heard that at Obydos calcareous\r\n  layers, thickly studded with marine shells, had been found\r\n  interstratified with the clay, but he did not himself examine the\r\n  strata. The Obydos shells are not marine, but are fresh-water Unios,\r\n  greatly resembling Aviculas, Solens, and Arcas. Such would-be marine\r\n  fossils have been brought to me from the shore opposite to Obydos,\r\n  near Santarem, and I have readily recognized them for what they truly\r\n  are,—fresh-water shells of the family of Naiades. I have myself\r\n  collected specimens of these shells in the clay-beds along the banks\r\n  of the Solimoens, near Teffé, and might have mistaken them for fossils\r\n  of that formation had I not known how Naiades burrow in the mud. Their\r\n  resemblance to the marine genera mentioned above is very remarkable,\r\n  and the mistake as to their true zoölogical character is as natural as\r\n  that by which earlier ichthyologists, and even travellers of very\r\n  recent date, have confounded some fresh-water fishes from the Upper\r\n  Amazons, of the genus Pterophyllum (Heckel), with the marine genus\r\n  Platax.\r\n\r\nFootnote 102:\r\n\r\n  As I have stated in the beginning, I am satisfied that the\r\n  unstratified clay deposit of Rio and its vicinity is genuine glacial\r\n  drift, resulting from the grinding of the loose materials interposed\r\n  between the glacier and the solid rock in place, and retaining to this\r\n  day the position in which it was left by the ice. Like all such\r\n  accumulations, it is totally free from stratification. If this be so,\r\n  it is evident, on comparing the two formations, that the ochraceous\r\n  sandy clay of the valley of the Amazons has been deposited under\r\n  different circumstances; that, while it owes its resemblance to the\r\n  Rio drift to the fact that its materials were originally ground by\r\n  glaciers in the upper part of the valley, these materials have\r\n  subsequently been spread throughout the whole basin and actually\r\n  deposited under the agency of water. A survey of the more southern\r\n  provinces of Brazil, extending to the temperate zone, where the\r\n  combined effects of a tropical sun and of tropical rains must\r\n  naturally be wanting, will, I trust, remove all the difficulties still\r\n  attending this explanation. The glacial phenomena, with all their\r\n  characteristic features, are already known to cover the southernmost\r\n  parts of South America. The intervening range, between 22° and 36° of\r\n  south latitude, cannot fail to exhibit the transition from the drift\r\n  of the cold and temperate zone to the formations of a kindred\r\n  character described above from the tropical zone. The knowledge of\r\n  these deposits will definitely settle the question; and either prove\r\n  the correctness of my generalizations or show their absurdity. I feel\r\n  no anxiety as to the result. I only long for a speedy removal of all\r\n  doubts.\r\n\r\nFootnote 103:\r\n\r\n  I would here remind the reader of the terraces of Glen Roy, which\r\n  indicate successive reductions of the barrier encasing the lake,\r\n  similar to those assumed to have taken place at the mouth of the\r\n  Amazons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIV.\r\n                                 CEARÁ.\r\n\r\n  LEAVING PARÁ.—FAREWELL TO THE AMAZONS.—EASE OF TRAVELLING ON THE\r\n    AMAZONS.—ROUGH PASSAGE.—ARRIVAL AT CEARÁ.—DIFFICULTY OF\r\n    LANDING.—ASPECT OF THE TOWN.—RAINY SEASON.—CONSEQUENT\r\n    SICKLINESS.—OUR PURPOSE IN STOPPING AT CEARÁ.—REPORT OF DR.\r\n    FELICE ABOUT MORAINES.—PREPARATIONS FOR JOURNEY INTO THE\r\n    INTERIOR.—DIFFICULTIES AND DELAYS IN GETTING OFF.—ON THE\r\n    WAY.—NIGHT AT ARANCHO.—BAD ROADS.—CARNAUBA PALM.—ARRIVAL AT\r\n    MONGUBA.—KIND RECEPTION BY SENHOR FRANKLIN DE LIMA.—GEOLOGY OF THE\r\n    REGION.—EVENING GAMES AND AMUSEMENTS.—PACATUBA.—TRACES OF ANCIENT\r\n    GLACIERS.—SERRA OF ARATANHA.—CLIMB UP THE SERRA.—HOSPITALITY OF\r\n    SENHOR DA COSTA.—PICTURESQUE VIEWS.—THE SERTAŌ.—DROUGHT AND\r\n    RAINS.—EPIDEMICS.—RETURN TO MONGUBA.—DETAINED BY EXTRAORDINARY\r\n    RAINS.—RETURN TO CEARÁ.—OVERFLOWED ROADS.—DIFFICULTY OF\r\n    FORDING.—ARRIVAL AT CEARÁ.—LIBERALITY OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE\r\n    PROVINCE TOWARD THE EXPEDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\n_April 2d._—Ceará. We left Pará on the 26th of March, in the evening,\r\nfeeling for the first time that we were indeed bidding good by to the\r\nAmazons. Our pleasant voyages on its yellow waters, our canoe excursions\r\non its picturesque lakes and igarapés, our lingerings in its\r\npalm-thatched cottages, belonged to the past; except in memory, our\r\nAmazonian travels were over. When we entered upon them, what vague\r\nanticipations, what visions of a new and interesting life, not, as we\r\nsupposed, without its dangers and anxieties, were before us. So little\r\nis known, even in Brazil, of the Amazons, that we could obtain only very\r\nmeagre and, usually, rather discouraging information concerning our\r\nprojected journey. In Rio, if you say you are going to ascend their\r\ngreat river, your Brazilian friends look at you with compassionate\r\nwonder. You are threatened with sickness, with intolerable heat, with\r\nthe absence of any nourishing food or suitable lodgings, with\r\nmosquitoes, with Jacarés and wild Indians. If you consult a physician,\r\nhe gives you a good supply of quinine, and tells you to take a dose\r\nevery other day as a preventive against fever and chills; so that if you\r\nescape intermittent fever you are at least sure of being poisoned by a\r\nremedy which, if administered incautiously, may cause a disease worse\r\nthan the one it cures. It will take perhaps from the excitement and\r\nnovelty of Amazonian travelling to know that the journey from Pará to\r\nTabatinga may be made with as much ease as a reasonable traveller has a\r\nright to expect, though of course not without some privations, and also\r\nwith no more exposure to sickness than the traveller incurs in any hot\r\nclimate. The perils and adventures which attended the voyages of Spix\r\nand Martius, or even of more recent travellers, like Castelnau, Bates,\r\nand Wallace, are no longer to be found on the main course of the\r\nAmazons, though they are met at every step on its great affluents. On\r\nthe Tocantins, on the Madeira, on the Purus, on the Rio Negro, the\r\nTrombetas, or any of the large tributaries, the traveller must still\r\nwork his way slowly up in a canoe, scorched by the sun or drenched by\r\nthe rain; sleeping on the beach, hearing the cries of the wild animals\r\nin the woods around him, and waking perhaps in the morning, to find the\r\ntracks of a tiger in unpleasant proximity to his hammock. But along the\r\ncourse of the Amazons itself, these days of romantic adventure and\r\nhair-breadth escapes are over; the wild beasts of the forest have\r\ndisappeared before the puff of the engine; the canoe and the encampment\r\non the beach at night have given place to the prosaic conveniences of\r\nthe steamboat. It is no doubt true of the Amazons, as of other tropical\r\nregions, that a long residence may reduce the vigor of the constitution,\r\nand perhaps make one more liable to certain diseases; but during our\r\njourney of eight months none of our large company suffered from any\r\nserious indisposition connected with the climate, nor did we see in any\r\nof our wanderings as many indications of intermittent fever as are to be\r\nmet constantly on our Western rivers. The voyage on the Amazons proper\r\nhas now become accessible to all who are willing to endure heat and\r\nmosquitoes for the sake of seeing the greatest river in the world, and\r\nthe magnificent tropical vegetation along its shores. The best season\r\nfor the journey is from the close of June to the middle of\r\nNovember,—July, August, September, and October being the four driest\r\nmonths of the year, and the most salubrious throughout that region.\r\n\r\nWe had a rough and boisterous passage from Pará to Ceará, with unceasing\r\nrain, in consequence of which the decks were constantly wet. Indeed, the\r\ncabins were not free from water, and it was only by frequent bailing\r\nthat the floor of our state-room was kept tolerably dry. At Maranham we\r\nhad the relief of a night on shore; and Mr. Agassiz and Major Coutinho\r\nprofited by the occasion the following morning to examine the geology of\r\nthe coast more carefully than they had formerly done. They found the\r\nstructure identical with that of the Amazonian Valley, except that the\r\nformations were more worn down and disturbed. We arrived before Ceará at\r\ntwo o’clock on Saturday, March 31st, expecting to go on shore at once;\r\nbut the sea ran high, the tide was unfavorable, and during the day not\r\neven a “jangada,” those singular rafts that here take the place of\r\nboats, ventured out to our steamer as she lay rocking in the surf. Ceará\r\nhas no harbor, and the sea drives in with fearful violence on the long\r\nsand-beach fronting the town, making it impossible, at certain states of\r\nthe tide and in stormy weather, for any boat to land, unless it be one\r\nof these jangadas (catamarans), over which the waves break without\r\nswamping them. At about nine o’clock in the evening a custom-house boat\r\ncame out, and, notwithstanding the lateness of the hour and the rough\r\nsea, we determined to go on shore, for we were told that in the morning\r\nthe tide would be unfavorable, and if the wind continued in the present\r\nquarter it might be still more difficult, if not impossible, to land. It\r\nwas not without some anxiety that I stood waiting my turn to enter the\r\nboat; for though at one moment it rose, on the swell of the sea, close\r\nto the stair, in the twinkling of an eye it was a couple of yards away.\r\nSome presence of mind and agility were needed in order to make the leap\r\njust at the right instant; and I was glad to find myself in the boat and\r\nnot in the water, the chances being about even. As we rode in over the\r\nbreakers, the boatmen entertained us with so many stories of the\r\ndifficulty of landing, the frequent accidents, and especially of one\r\nwhich had occurred a few days before when three Englishmen had been\r\ndrowned, that I began to think reaching the shore must be more perilous\r\nthan leaving the ship. As we approached the town the scene was not\r\nwithout its picturesque charm. The moon, struggling through gray, watery\r\nclouds, threw a fitful light over the long sand-beach, on which the\r\ncrested waves were driving furiously. A number of laden boats were\r\ntossing in the surf, and the roar of the breakers mingled with the cries\r\nof the black porters, as they waded breast high through the water,\r\nunloading the cargoes and carrying their burdens to the shore on their\r\nheads. We were landed much in the same way, the boatmen carrying us over\r\nthe surf. This is the ordinary mode of embarking or landing passengers;\r\nit is but rarely, and at particular states of the tide, that it is\r\npossible to disembark at the pier which has been thrown out from the\r\nshore. Major Coutinho had written to a friend to engage lodgings for us,\r\nand we found a house ready. I was glad to sink into my comfortable\r\nhammock, to exchange the pitching and rolling of the steamer for its\r\ngentle rocking, to be out of reach of the hungry waves, and yet to hear\r\ntheir distant rush on the shore as I fell asleep.\r\n\r\nThe next morning was rainy, but in the afternoon it cleared, and toward\r\nevening we took a long drive with our host, Dr. Felice. I like the\r\naspect of Ceará. I like its wide, well-paved, cleanly streets, which are\r\nbright with color, for the substantial houses on either side are of many\r\nhues. If it chance to be a Sunday or a festa day, every balcony is\r\nfilled with gayly-dressed girls, while groups of men sit smoking and\r\ntalking on the sidewalks before the doors. This town has not the\r\nstagnant, inanimate look of many Brazilian towns. It tells of movement,\r\nlife, prosperity.[104] Beyond the city the streets stretch out into the\r\ncampos, bordered on its inland side by beautiful serras; the Serra\r\nGrande and the Serra de Baturité. In front of the city stretches the\r\nbroad sand-beach, and the murmur of the surf comes up into the heart of\r\nthe town. It seems as if, so lying between sea and mountain, Ceará\r\nshould be a healthy place, and it is usually so reputed. But at this\r\nmoment, owing, it is thought, to the unusual continuance of the dry\r\nseason and the extraordinary violence of the rains, now that they have\r\nbegun, the town is very sickly. Yellow-fever is prevalent, and there\r\nhave been a good many deaths from it recently, though it is said not to\r\nhave assumed the character of an epidemic as yet. Still more fatal is\r\nthe malignant dysentery, which has been raging both in town and country\r\nfor the last two months.\r\n\r\nWe are trying to hasten the arrangements for our inland journey, but do\r\nnot find it very easy. Mr. Agassiz’s object in stopping here is to\r\nsatisfy himself by direct investigation of the former existence of\r\nglaciers in the serras of this province, and, if possible, to find some\r\ntraces of the southern lateral moraine, marking the limit of the mass of\r\nice which he supposes to have filled the Amazonian basin in the glacial\r\nperiod. In the Amazonian Valley itself he has seen that all the\r\ngeological phenomena are connected with the close of the glacial period,\r\nwith the melting of the ice and the immense freshets consequent upon its\r\ndisappearance. On leaving the Amazons, the next step in the\r\ninvestigation was to seek the masses of loose materials left by the\r\nglacier itself. On arriving here he at once made inquiries to this\r\neffect, from a number of persons who have travelled a great deal in the\r\nprovince, and are therefore familiar with its features. The most\r\nvaluable information he has obtained,—valuable from the fact, that the\r\nprecision with which it is given shows that it may be relied upon,—is\r\nfrom Dr. Felice. His occupation as land-surveyor has led him to travel a\r\ngreat deal in the region of the Serra Grande. He has made a valuable map\r\nof this portion of the province, and he tells Mr. Agassiz that there is\r\na wall of loose materials, boulders, stones, &c., running from east to\r\nwest for a distance of some sixty leagues from the Rio Aracaty-Assù to\r\nBom Jesu, in the Serra Grande. From his account, this wall resembles\r\ngreatly the “Horsebacks” in Maine, those remarkable ridges accumulated\r\nby the ancient glaciers, and running sometimes uninterruptedly for\r\nthirty or forty miles. The horsebacks are, however, covered with soil\r\nand turf, whereas Dr. Felice describes this wall as rough and bare. Mr.\r\nAgassiz has no doubt that this accumulation or dike of loose materials,\r\nthe position and direction of which corresponds exactly with his\r\nconjecture based upon the evidence obtained in the Amazonian Valley, is\r\na portion of the lateral moraine, marking the southeastern limit of the\r\ngreat Amazonian glacier. Unhappily, it is impossible for him to visit it\r\nhimself, for even could he devote the time necessary for so long a\r\njourney in the interior, we are told that at this season the state of\r\nthe roads makes it almost impossible. He must therefore leave the\r\nidentification of this colossal moraine to some younger and more\r\nfortunate investigator, and content himself with a direct examination of\r\nthe next link in the chain of evidence, namely, the traces of local\r\nglaciers in the serras in the more immediate neighborhood of Ceará. If\r\nthe basin of the Amazons was actually filled with ice, all the mountains\r\nlying outside of its limits in the neighboring provinces must have had\r\ntheir glaciers also. It is in search of these local glaciers that we\r\nundertake our present journey, hoping to reach the Serra of Baturité.\r\n\r\n_April 6th._—Pacatuba (at the foot of the Serra of Aratanha). After\r\nendless delays and difficulties about horses, servants, and other\r\npreparations for our journey, we succeeded in getting off on the\r\nafternoon of the 3d. The mode of travelling in the interior as well as\r\nthe character of the people, makes it almost impossible to accomplish\r\nany journey with promptness and punctuality. While the preparations for\r\nour excursion were going on, neighbors and acquaintances would stroll in\r\nto see how things were advancing; one would propose that we should\r\npostpone our departure till the day after to-morrow, on account of some\r\ntrouble about the horses; another that we should wait a week or two for\r\nmore favorable weather. Evidently it did not occur to any one that it\r\ncould be of much importance whether we started to-day or to-morrow, or\r\nnext week or next month. The lotus-eaters in the “land in which it\r\nseemed always afternoon” could not have been more happily indifferent to\r\nthe passage of time. Now this calm superiority to laws obeyed by the\r\nrest of mankind, this ignoring of the great dictum “_tempus fugit_,” is\r\nrather exasperating to a man who has only the fortnight intervening\r\nbetween two steamers in which to accomplish his journey, and knows the\r\ntime to be all too short for the objects he has in view. These habits of\r\nprocrastination are much less marked in those parts of Brazil where\r\nrailroad and steam travel have been introduced; though it cannot be said\r\nthat promptness and despatch are anywhere familiar qualities in this\r\ncountry. Our delays in this particular instance were in no way owing to\r\nany want of interest in our plans; on the contrary, we met here, as\r\neverywhere, the most cordial sympathy with the objects of the\r\nexpedition, and the President of the province, as well as other persons,\r\nwere ready to give every assistance in their power. But a stranger\r\ncannot of course expect the habits of the people to be changed to suit\r\nhis convenience, and we did but share in the general slowness of\r\nmovement. However, we were at last on the way; our party consisting of\r\nMajor Coutinho, Senhor Pompeo, Government Engineer of the province, whom\r\nthe President had kindly detailed to accompany us, Mr. Agassiz, and\r\nmyself. We had a servant, also provided by the President, one of his\r\nguard, and two men, with a couple of pack-mules for baggage and\r\nprovisions. We started so late in the day, that our first ride was but a\r\nleague or so out of the town; short as it was, however, we did not\r\nescape several showers, always to be expected at this season. Yet the\r\nride was pleasant; a smell as of huckleberry meadows came from the low\r\ngrowth of shrubs covering the fields for miles around, and the very\r\nearth was fragrant from the rain. As we left the city, low clouds, full\r\nof distant showers, hung over the serras, and gave them a sombre beauty,\r\nmore impressive, if less cheerful, than their sunshine look. At six\r\no’clock we reached Arancho, a village where we were to pass the night.\r\nAs we rode in at dusk, it seemed to me only a little cluster of low\r\nmud-houses; but I found, by daylight, there were one or two buildings of\r\nmore pretentious character. We stopped at the end of the principal\r\nstreet, before the venda (village inn). At the door, which opened across\r\nthe middle, allowing its lower half to serve as a sort of gate, stood\r\nthe host, little expecting guests on this dark, rainy night. He was a\r\nfat old man, with a head as round as a bullet, covered with very short\r\nwhite curly hair, and a face beaming with good nature, but reddened also\r\nby many potations. He was dressed in white cotton drawers with a shirt\r\nhanging loose over them; his feet were stockingless, but he had on a\r\npair of the wooden-soled slippers, down at heel, of which you hear the\r\n“clack, clack” in every town and village during the rainy season. He\r\nopened the gate and admitted us into a small room furnished with a\r\nhammock, a sofa, and a few chairs, the mud walls adorned with some\r\ncoarse prints, of which the old gentleman seemed very proud. He said if\r\nwe could be satisfied with such accommodation as he had, the gentlemen\r\nto sling their hammocks in the sitting-room with him, the Senhora to\r\nsleep with his wife and the children in the only other room he had to\r\noffer, he should be happy to receive us. I confess that the prospect was\r\nnot encouraging; but I was prepared to meet with inconveniences, knowing\r\nthat even a short journey into the interior involved discomforts, and\r\nwhen the hostess presently entered and made me heartily welcome to a\r\ncorner of her apartment, I thanked her with such cordiality as I could\r\nmuster. She was many years younger than her husband, and still very\r\nhandsome, with an Oriental kind of beauty, rather enhanced by her dress.\r\nShe wore a red muslin wrapper, somewhat the worse for wear, but still\r\nbrilliant in color; and her long black hair hung loose and unbraided\r\nover her shoulders. An hour or two later supper was announced. We had\r\nbrought the greater part of it with us from the city, but we invited all\r\nthe family to sup with us, according to the fashion of the country. The\r\nold gentleman completed his toilet by adding to it a gaudy-flowered\r\ncotton dressing-gown, and seating himself at the table, contemplated the\r\nroast-chickens and claret with no little satisfaction. From the\r\nappearance of things, such a meal must have been a rarity in his house.\r\nThe mud floor of the kitchen where we supped was sloppy, and its leaky\r\nroof and broken walls were but dimly lighted by the coarse guttering\r\ncandles made from the Carnauba palm. I presently heard a loud gobbling\r\nclose by my side; and, looking down, saw by the half-light a black pig\r\nfeeding at a little table with the two children, assisted also by the\r\ndog and the cat. Supper over, I proposed to go to the common sleeping\r\napartment, preferring to be in advance of my companions. It was a little\r\nroom, some ten feet square, behind the one where we had been received,\r\nand without any window. This is not, however, so great an objection\r\nhere, where the roofs are so open that a great deal of air comes from\r\nabove. Once ensconced in my hammock I began to watch the arrival of my\r\nroom-mates with some curiosity. First entered a young girl and her\r\nlittle sister, who stowed themselves away in one of the beds; then came\r\nthe servant-maid and hung herself up in her hammock in a corner; and\r\nlastly arrived the landlady, who took possession of the other bed, and\r\ncompleted the charms of the scene by lighting her pipe to have a quiet\r\nsmoke before she went to sleep. I cannot say the situation was favorable\r\nto rest; the heavy showers which rattled on the tiles throughout the\r\nnight penetrated the leaky roof, and, however I changed my position in\r\nthe hammock, it rained into my face; fleas were abundant; the silence\r\nwas occasionally broken by the crying of the children, or the grunting\r\nof the pig at the door, and for my part I was very glad when five\r\no’clock called us all to get up, our plan being to start at six and ride\r\nthree leagues before breakfast. However, on a journey of this kind, it\r\nis one thing to intend going anywhere at a particular time and quite\r\nanother to accomplish it. When we met at six o’clock in readiness for\r\nour journey, two of the horses were not to be found; they had strayed\r\naway during the night. Though accidents of this kind are a constant\r\nsubject of complaint, it does not seem to occur to any one to secure the\r\nhorses for the night; it is indeed far easier to let them roam about and\r\nprovide for themselves. The servants were sent to look for them, and we\r\nsat waiting, and losing the best hours of the morning, till, in their\r\nown good time, men and beasts reappeared. We were at last on the road at\r\nhalf past eight o’clock; but, unhappily, it was just during our two\r\nhours of inaction that the rain, which had been pouring in torrents all\r\nnight, had ceased for a time. We had scarcely started when it began\r\nagain, and accompanied us for a great part of the way on our long three\r\nleagues’ ride. We came now for the first time on the Carnauba palm\r\n(Copernicia cerifera), so invaluable for its many useful properties. It\r\nfurnishes an admirable timber, strong and durable, from which the\r\nrafters of all the houses in this region are made; it yields a wax\r\nwhich, if the process of refining and bleaching it were understood,\r\nwould make an excellent candle, and which, as it is, is used for light\r\nthroughout the province; from its silky fibre very strong thread and\r\ncordage are manufactured; the heart of the leaves, when cooked, makes an\r\nexcellent vegetable, resembling delicate cabbage; and, finally, it\r\nprovides a very nourishing fodder for cattle. It is a saying in the\r\nprovince of Ceará, that where the Carnauba palm abounds a man has all he\r\nneeds for himself and his horse. The stem is tall, and the leaves so\r\narranged around the summit as to form a close spherical crown, entirely\r\nunlike that of any other palm.[105]\r\n\r\nIf we had to lament the rain, we were fortunate in not having the sun on\r\nour journey, for the forest is low and affords but little shade. The\r\nroad was in a terrible condition from the long-continued rains, and\r\nthough there are no rivers of any importance between the town and the\r\nSerra of Monguba, to which we were bound, yet in several places the\r\nlittle streams were swollen to a considerable depth; and, owing to the\r\nbroken condition of the bottom, full of holes and deep ruts, they were\r\nby no means easy to ford. After a fatiguing ride of four hours, during\r\nwhich we inquired, two or three times, how far we had still to go, and\r\nalways received the same answer, “uma legua,” that league never seeming\r\nto diminish with our advance, we were delighted to find ourselves at the\r\nlittle bridle-path which turned off from the main road and led us to the\r\nfazenda of Senhor Franklin de Lima. The traveller is always welcome who\r\nasks hospitality at a Brazilian country house, but Major Coutinho had\r\nalready stayed at this fazenda on previous journeys, and we shared the\r\nwelcome given to him as an old friend. The hospitality of our excellent\r\nhosts repaid us for all the fatigues of our journey, and our luggage\r\nbeing still on the road, their kindness supplied the defects of our\r\ntoilet, which was in a lamentable condition after splashing through\r\nmuddy water two or three feet deep. Mr. Agassiz, however, could not\r\nspare time to rest; we had followed a morainic soil for a great part of\r\nour journey, had passed many boulders on the road, and he was anxious to\r\nexamine the Serra of Monguba, on the slope of which Senhor Franklin has\r\nhis coffee plantation, and at the foot of which his house stands. He\r\nwas, therefore, either on foot or on horseback the greater part of this\r\nday and the following one, examining the geological structure of the\r\nmountain, and satisfying himself that, here too, all the valleys have\r\nhad their glaciers, and that these valleys have brought down from the\r\nhillsides into the plains boulders, pebbles, and _débris_ of all sorts.\r\nIn this pleasant home, in the midst of the bright, intelligent circle\r\ncomposing the family of Senhor Franklin, we passed two days. After\r\nbreakfast we dispersed to our various occupations, the gentlemen being\r\nengaged in excursions in the neighborhood; the evening brought us\r\ntogether again, and was enlivened with music, dancing, and games. The\r\nBrazilians are fond of games, and play them with much wit and animation.\r\nOne of their favorite games is called “the market of saints”; it is very\r\namusing when there are two or three bright people to act the prominent\r\nparts. One person performs the salesman, another the padre who comes to\r\npurchase a saint for his chapel; the company enact the saints, covering\r\ntheir faces with their handkerchiefs, and remaining as motionless as\r\npossible. The salesman brings in the padre, and, taking him from one to\r\nanother in turn, describes all their extraordinary miraculous qualities,\r\ntheir wonderful lives and pious deaths. After a few introductory remarks\r\non the subject of the purchase, the handkerchief is drawn off, and if\r\nthe saint keeps his countenance and remains immovable during all the\r\nridiculous things that are said about him, he comes off scot free; but\r\nif he laughs he is subject to a forfeit. There are indeed few who stand\r\nthe test; for if the salesman has any tact in the game, he knows how to\r\nseize upon any funny incident or characteristic quality connected with\r\nthe individual, and give it prominence. Perhaps the reader, knowing\r\nsomething of our hunt for glaciers, may guess this saint, Major Coutinho\r\nbeing salesman. “This, Senhor Padre, is rather a stout saint, but still\r\nof most pious disposition, and, O meu Padre! a wonderful worker of\r\nmiracles; he can fill these valleys with ice, he covers the mountains\r\nwith snow in the hottest days, he brings the stones from the top of the\r\nserra to the bottom, he finds animals in the bowels of the earth and\r\nbrings out their bones.” “Ah!” replies the padre, “a wonderful saint,\r\ntruly! such an one as I need for my chapel; let me look upon his face.”\r\nHandkerchief withdrawn, and the saint in question of course loses his\r\nforfeit. Yesterday, after breakfast, we left our pleasant friends and\r\ncame on to the little village of Pacatuba, a league farther inland, and\r\nmost picturesquely situated at the foot of the Serra of Aratanha. Here\r\nwe are fortunate in finding an empty “sobrada” (two-storied house), in\r\nwhich we shall establish ourselves for the two or three days we mean to\r\nspend in this neighborhood. We have had it swept out, have hung our\r\nhammocks in the vacant rooms, which, with the exception of a straw sofa\r\nand a few chairs, are innocent of furniture; and if we find it rather\r\nforlorn within doors, we have at least beautiful views from all our\r\nwindows.\r\n\r\n_April 7th._—Pacatuba. We have already ascertained that our exploration\r\nmust be confined to the serras in the midst of which we find ourselves;\r\nfor every one tells us that, in the present state of the roads, it would\r\nbe impossible to go to Baturité and return in the short time we have at\r\nour disposal. However, Mr. Agassiz is not disappointed; for he says a\r\nfarther journey could only give him glacial phenomena on a larger scale,\r\nwhich he finds here immediately about him in the greatest perfection. On\r\nthis very Serra of Aratanha, at the foot of which we happen to have\r\ntaken up our quarters, the glacial phenomena are as legible as in any of\r\nthe valleys of Maine, or in those of the mountains of Cumberland in\r\nEngland. It had evidently a local glacier, formed by the meeting of two\r\narms, which descended from two depressions spreading right and left on\r\nthe upper part of the serra, and joining below in the main valley. A\r\nlarge part of the medial moraine formed by the meeting of these two arms\r\ncan still be traced in the central valley. One of the lateral moraines\r\nis perfectly preserved, the village road cutting through it; while the\r\nvillage itself is built just within the terminal moraine, which is\r\nthrown up in a long ridge in front of it. It is a curious fact that, in\r\nthe centre of the medial moraine, formed by a little mountain stream\r\nmaking its way through the ridge of rocks and boulders, is a delicious\r\nbathing pool, overgrown by orange-trees and palms. As Mr. Agassiz came\r\ndown from the serra yesterday, heated with his hunt after glaciers under\r\na tropical sun, he stopped to bathe in this pool. He said, as he enjoyed\r\nits refreshing coolness, he could not but be struck with the contrast\r\nbetween the origin of this basin and the vegetation which now surrounds\r\nit; to say nothing of the odd coincidence that he, a naturalist of the\r\nnineteenth century, should be bathing under the shade of palms and\r\norange-trees on the very spot where he sought and found the evidence of\r\na cold so intense that it heaped the mountains with ice.\r\n\r\n_April 9th._—Yesterday, at seven o’clock in the morning, we left\r\nPacatuba for the house of Senhor da Costa, lying half-way up the serra,\r\nat a height of about eight hundred feet above the level of the sea. The\r\npath up the serra is wild and picturesque, lined with immense boulders,\r\nand shaded with large trees; while here and there a little cascade comes\r\nbrawling down over the rocks. In this climate, a road so broken by\r\nboulders is especially beautiful, on account of the luxuriance of the\r\nvegetation. Exquisite vines, shrubs, and even trees spring up wherever\r\nthey can find the least soil in which to strike root; and many of these\r\nisolated rocks are gardens in themselves. One immense boulder in the\r\npath is split, and from its centre springs a palm all draperied in\r\nvines. Of the native trees, the Genipapu (Genipa braziliensis), the\r\nImbauba (Cecropia), the Carnauba (Copernicia cerifera), the Catolé\r\n(Attalea humilis), and the Paō d’Arco (Tecoma speciosa) are most\r\nprominent. The latter is so named because the Indians make their bows\r\nfrom its tough, elastic wood. Though not native to the soil, bananas,\r\ncocoa-nut palms, orange-trees, as well as cotton and coffee shrubs, are\r\nabundant. The cultivation of coffee, which thrives admirably on the\r\nslopes of all the serras, is the great source of prosperity here; but,\r\nat least in the sitios we have visited, it is difficult to judge of the\r\nextent of the plantations on account of the irregular manner of\r\nplanting. The crops are, however, very large, and the coffee superior in\r\nquality. I found the climb up the precipitous serra exceedingly\r\nfatiguing. The people who live on the mountain come and go constantly,\r\neven with their children, on horseback; but as our horses were from the\r\ncity, and unaccustomed to mountain paths, we had preferred ascending on\r\nfoot, especially as the rains had made the road more rough and broken\r\nthan usual. A mountain scramble in this country is very different from\r\nthe same thing in temperate climates. The least exertion induces\r\nexcessive perspiration; and if, when thus drenched to the skin, you stop\r\nto rest, you are chilled by the slightest breeze. I was very glad when,\r\nafter about an hour’s climbing, we reached the sitio of Senhor da Costa,\r\non the slope of the serra. Donna Maria laughed at me for coming up on\r\nfoot, and said I should have mounted like a man, as she does, and\r\nascended the serra on horseback. Indeed, I think a lady who is obliged\r\nto make a journey in the interior of Brazil should dress Bloomer-fashion\r\nand mount _en cavalier_. A lady’s seat on horseback is too insecure for\r\ndangerous mountain roads, or for fording streams; and her long skirt is\r\nanother inconvenience.\r\n\r\nNothing can be more picturesque than the situation of this sitio. It is\r\nsurrounded by magnificent masses of rock, which seem embedded in the\r\nforest, as it were; and by its side a cascade comes leaping down through\r\nthe trees, so hidden by them that, though you hear the voice of the\r\nwater constantly, you only see its glimmer here and there among the\r\ngreen foliage. The house itself stands on a fine specimen of moraine,\r\nflanked on one side by a bank of red morainic soil, overtopped by\r\nboulders. It is so built in among huge masses of rock that its walls\r\nseem half natural. At the foot of the mountain spreads the Sertaō,\r\nstretching level for the most part to the ocean, though broken here and\r\nthere by billowy hills rising isolated from its surface. Beyond it many\r\nmiles away may be seen the yellow lines of the sand-dunes on the shore,\r\nand the white glitter of the sea. The Sertaō (desert) is beautifully\r\ngreen now, and spreads out like a verdant prairie below. But in the dry\r\nseason it justifies its name and becomes a very desert indeed, being so\r\nparched that all vegetation is destroyed. The drought is so great during\r\neight months of the year, that the country people living in the Sertaō\r\nare often in danger of famine from the drying up of all the crops.[106]\r\nAfter this long dry season the rains often set in with terrible\r\nviolence, and it is at this time that epidemics are developed, such as\r\nprevail now. It rains day and night for weeks at a time, till everything\r\nis penetrated with dampness; and when the hot sun comes out upon the\r\nsoaked and steaming earth, it is far more injurious than in the dry\r\nseason. One cannot wonder at the prevailing sickness, for the humidity\r\nseems to permeate everything with subtle power. The walls, the floors,\r\nthe very furniture,—your hammock at night and your clothes in the\r\nmorning,—feel damp and have a sort of clammy chill; and the sun comes\r\nout with such fitful gleams, that, intense as is its heat while it\r\nlasts, nothing becomes thoroughly dried.\r\n\r\nToward nightfall we went to see the sunset from a boulder of enormous\r\nsize, which seems to have stopped inexplicably on the steep descent. It\r\njuts out from the mountain-side, and commands even a more extensive view\r\nthan the house above. I could not help thinking, as we stood on the edge\r\nof this immense mass of rock, that, as it seemed to have stopped for no\r\nparticular reason, it might start again at any minute, and bring one to\r\nthe bottom of the serra with unpleasant rapidity.\r\n\r\n_April 10th._—Yesterday afternoon we returned to Pacatuba, descending\r\nthe serra much more rapidly and with far less fatigue than we had\r\nascended. We would gladly have availed ourselves longer of the pleasant\r\nhospitality of our hosts, who very graciously urged us to stay; but time\r\nis precious, and we are anxious not to miss the next steamer. Donna\r\nMaria’s kindness followed us down the mountain, however, for scarcely\r\nhad we reached the house before an excellent dinner—stewed fowls, beef,\r\nvegetables, etc.—arrived, borne on the heads of two negroes. When I saw\r\nthe load these men had brought so steadily down the same path over which\r\nI had come rolling, pitching, tumbling, sliding,—any way, in short, but\r\nwalking,—I envied their dexterity, and longed to be as sure-footed as\r\nthese shoeless, half naked, ignorant blacks. To-day we leave Pacatuba\r\nfor the house of Senhor Franklin, on our way back to Ceará.\r\n\r\n_April 12th._—On the 10th we returned to Monguba, where we passed that\r\nday and the following night at the fazenda of our friends, the\r\nFranklins. The next morning we had intended to start at six o’clock on\r\nour way to the city. No sooner were the horses at the door, however, and\r\nthe pack-mules ready, than a pouring rain began. We waited for it to\r\npass, but it was followed by shower after shower, falling in solid\r\nsheets. So the day wore on till twelve o’clock, when there was a lull,\r\nwith a prospect of fine weather, and we started. I could not help\r\nfeeling some anxiety, for I remembered the streams we had forded in\r\ncoming, and wondered what they would be after these torrents.\r\nFortunately, before we reached the first of them, we met two negroes,\r\nwho warned us that there was a great deal of water on the road. We hired\r\nthem to come on with us, and guide my horse. When we reached the spot it\r\nreally looked appalling. The road was inundated to a considerable\r\ndistance, and the water rushed across it with great violence, having in\r\nmany places a depth of four or five feet, and a strong current. If there\r\nhad been a sound bottom to rely upon, the wetting would have been\r\nnothing; but the road, torn up by the rains, was full of holes and deep\r\ngullies, so that the horses, coming unexpectedly on these inequalities,\r\nwould suddenly flounder up to their necks in water, and recover their\r\nfooting only by kicking and plunging. We crossed four such streams, one\r\nman leading my horse while the gentlemen followed close behind, and the\r\nsecond negro walking in front to see where it was possible to pass\r\nwithout getting completely out of depth. These streams, not quite deep\r\nenough to allow the horse to swim, and with such a broken bottom that he\r\nis in constant danger of falling, are sometimes more difficult of\r\npassage than a river. We met with only one accident, however, which, as\r\nit did no harm, was rather ludicrous than otherwise. The negroes had\r\nleft us, saying there was no more deep water in the road, and when we\r\ncame presently to a shallow stream we entered it quite confidently. It\r\nwas treacherous, however, for just on its edge was a soft, adhesive\r\nbog-mud. In entering, the horses stepped across this quagmire, but their\r\nhind legs were instantly caught in it. Major Coutinho, who was riding at\r\nmy side, seized my bridle, and, spurring his own horse violently, both\r\nthe animals extricated themselves at once by a powerful effort. Our\r\nservant, who followed behind, was not so fortunate; he was mounted on a\r\nsmall mule, which seemed likely to be swallowed up bodily for a moment,\r\nso suddenly did it disappear in the mire; the man fell off, and it was\r\nsome minutes before he and his animal regained the road, a mass of mud\r\nand dripping with water. We reached Ceará at five in the afternoon,\r\nhaving made a journey of five leagues. Every one tells us that the state\r\nof the roads is most unusual, such continuous rains not having been\r\nknown for many years. The sickness in the city continues unabated, and a\r\nyoung man who was attacked with yellow-fever in the next house before we\r\nleft has died in our absence. Everywhere on our journey we have heard\r\nthe same complaints of prevalent epidemics, and the authorities are\r\nbeginning to close the schools in the town on account of them. The\r\nsteamer is due in a day or two, and we are making our preparations for\r\ndeparture. We should not bid good by to Ceará without acknowledging the\r\nsympathy shown by the President of the Province, Senhor Homem de Mello,\r\nin the objects of the expedition. Mr. Agassiz has received a collection\r\nof palms and fishes, the directions for which he had given before\r\nstarting for the Serra, but the expenses of which are defrayed by the\r\nPresident, who insists upon their being received as a contribution from\r\nthe province. Mr. Agassiz is also greatly indebted to Senhor Felice, at\r\nwhose house we have lodged, for efficient help in collecting, and to\r\nSenhor Cicero de Lima for a collection of fishes and insects from the\r\ninterior. I conclude this chapter with a few passages from notes made by\r\nMr. Agassiz during his examination of the Serra of Aratanha and the site\r\nof Pacatuba.\r\n\r\n“I spent the rest of the day in a special examination of the right\r\nlateral moraine, and part of the front moraine of the glacier of\r\nPacatuba; my object was especially to ascertain whether what appeared a\r\nmoraine at first might not, after all, be a spur of the serra,\r\ndecomposed in place. I ascended the ridge to its very origin, and there\r\ncrossed into an adjoining depression, immediately below the Sitio of\r\nCaptain Henriquez, where I found another glacier bottom of smaller\r\ndimensions, the ice of which probably never reached the plain.\r\nEverywhere in the ridges encircling these depressions the loose\r\nmaterials and large boulders are so accumulated and embedded in clay or\r\nsand that their morainic character is unmistakable. Occasionally, where\r\na ledge of the underlying rock crops out, in places where the drift has\r\nbeen removed by denudation, the difference between the moraine and the\r\nrock decomposed in place is recognized at once. It is equally easy to\r\ndistinguish the boulders which here and there have rolled down from the\r\nmountain and stopped against the moraine. The three things are side by\r\nside, and might at first be easily confounded; but a little familiarity\r\nmakes it easy to distinguish them. Where the lateral moraine turns\r\ntoward the front of the ancient glacier, near the point at which the\r\nbrook of Pacatuba cuts through the former, and a little to the west of\r\nthe brook, there are colossal boulders leaning against the moraine, from\r\nthe summit of which they have probably rolled down. Near the cemetery\r\nthe front moraine consists almost entirely of small quartz pebbles;\r\nthere are, however, a few larger blocks among them. The medial moraine\r\nextends nearly through the centre of the village, while the left-hand\r\nlateral moraine lies outside of the village, at its eastern end, and is\r\ntraversed by the road leading to Ceará. It is not impossible that\r\neastwards a third tributary of the serra may have reached the main\r\nglacier of Pacatuba. I may say, that in the whole valley of Hasli there\r\nare no accumulations of morainic materials more characteristic than\r\nthose I have found here,—not even about the Kirchet; neither are there\r\nany remains of the kind more striking about the valleys of Mount Desert\r\nin Maine, where the glacial phenomena are so remarkable, nor in the\r\nvalleys of Lough Fine, Lough Augh, and Lough Long in Scotland, where the\r\ntraces of ancient glaciers are so distinct. In none of these localities\r\nare the glacial phenomena more legible than in the Serra of Aratanha. I\r\nhope that before long some members of the Alpine Club, thoroughly\r\nfamiliar with the glaciers of the Old World, not only in their present,\r\nbut also in their past condition, will come to these mountains of Ceará\r\nand trace the outlines of their former glaciers more extensively than it\r\nhas been possible for me to do in this short journey. It would be an\r\neasy excursion, since steamers from Liverpool and Bordeaux reach\r\nPernambuco in about ten days, arriving twice a month, while Brazilian\r\nsteamers make the trip from Pernambuco to Ceará in two days. The nearest\r\nserra in which I have observed traces of ancient glaciers is reached\r\nfrom Ceará in one day on horseback. The best season for such a journey\r\nwould be June and July, at the close of the rainy season, and before the\r\ngreat droughts of the dry season have began.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 104:\r\n\r\n  The prosperous province of Ceará has found in Senator Pompeo a worthy\r\n  exponent of its interests; not only does he represent the province at\r\n  Rio de Janeiro, but, by the publication of careful statistics, has\r\n  largely contributed to its progress.—L.

There was nothing worth recording in our voyage\r\ndown the coast, except that at Pernambuco we found the country even more\r\noverflowed by the recent rains than it had been at Ceará. Going to\r\nbreakfast with our friends, Mr. and Mrs. R——, only four or five miles\r\nfrom the city, we passed through portions of the road where the water\r\nwas nearly level with the floor of the carriage; and temporary ferries\r\nwere established by negroes, who were plying rafts and canoes between\r\nthe shores for the benefit of foot-passengers. A mile or two beyond Mr.\r\nR——’s house we were told that the road, though one of the most\r\nfrequented in the neighborhood of the city, had become quite impassable.\r\nWe saw many overflowed gardens and houses abandoned because the water\r\nwas already above the windows of the ground-floor.\r\n\r\nWe had a warm welcome back to the beautiful bay of Rio, on board the\r\n“Susquehanna,” just then in the harbor. Captain Taylor sent his boat at\r\nonce to our steamer, and we were soon on his deck, received so cordially\r\nby him and his officers, and by a party of American friends who were\r\nmaking a visit to his ship, that it seemed like an anticipation of our\r\narrival at home. There is nothing so pleasant as an unexpected meeting\r\nwith one’s own fellow-citizens on coming into a foreign port, and this\r\nwas a delightful surprise to us.\r\n\r\nWe are again in our old quarters in the Rua Direita, and, except that\r\nour fellow-travellers are all scattered, it would seem as if we had\r\nstepped back a year. Since our return, Mr. Agassiz has been arranging\r\nand despatching to the United States the numerous specimens which have\r\nbeen sent in during our absence. Among them is the large and very\r\ncomplete collection made for him by the Emperor last summer, when in\r\ncommand of the army at the South. It contains fishes from several of the\r\nsouthern fresh-water basins, and includes a great number of new species.\r\nTaken in connection with the Amazonian collections and those from the\r\ninterior, it affords material for an extensive comparison of the faunæ\r\nof the southern and northern fresh-waters in Brazil.\r\n\r\nOur excursions since our return have been only in the neighborhood of\r\nthe city to Petropolis and the Dom Pedro Railroad. We are surprised, on\r\nreturning to this road while our Amazonian impressions are fresh in our\r\nminds, to find that the vegetation, the richness of which amazed us when\r\nwe first arrived in Brazil, looks almost meagre in comparison to that\r\nwith which we have since been familiar. It is dwarfed, to our eye, by\r\nthe still more luxuriant growth of the north.\r\n\r\nYesterday was Mr. Agassiz’s birthday, again made very bright to us by\r\nthe cordial testimony of kind feeling and sympathy from his friends and\r\ncountry people. In the evening we were pleasantly surprised by a\r\ntorchlight procession in his honor, formed by the German and Swiss\r\nresidents of Rio de Janeiro. The festivities concluded with a serenade\r\nunder our windows by the German club.\r\n\r\n_June 4th._—When we were in Rio de Janeiro last year, Mr. Agassiz was so\r\nmuch occupied with the plans of the expedition that he was unable to\r\nvisit the schools of the city, its charitable institutions, and the\r\nlike. Being unwilling to leave Brazil without knowing something of the\r\npublic works in its largest capital, we are now engaged in\r\n“sight-seeing.” This morning we visited the Misericordia Hospital.\r\nPerhaps it will give a better idea of this institution, and of the\r\ninfluences under which it at present exists, to speak of it first as it\r\nwas formerly. Nearly forty years ago there was in Rio de Janeiro a\r\nhospital called “De la Misericordia.” Its wards were low, its entries\r\nwere confined and close, its staircases steep and narrow. According to\r\nthe accounts of physicians who were medical students there in those\r\ndays, its internal organization was as sordid as its general aspect. The\r\nfloors were wet and dirty, the beds wretched, the linen soiled; and the\r\nabsence of a system of ventilation made itself the more felt on account\r\nof the want of general cleanliness. The corpses awaited burial in a room\r\nwhere the rats held high festival; and a physician, who has since\r\noccupied a distinguished position in Rio de Janeiro, told us that when,\r\nas a student, he went to seek there the materials for his anatomical\r\nstudies, he often found life stirring in this chamber of the dead, and\r\nstartled away these unseemly visitors. Such, in brief, was the\r\nMisericordia Hospital at the time when Brazil secured her independence.\r\nLet us see what it is now. On the same spot, though occupying a much\r\nlarger space, stands the present hospital. When completed, it will\r\nconsist of three parallel buildings, long in proportion to their\r\nbreadth, connected by cross corridors enclosing courts between them. The\r\ncentral edifice, intended for male patients, has been long in use. The\r\nfront building, looking on the bay, is nearly completed, and is to be\r\ndevoted to the stores, to accommodations for hospital physicians,\r\nnurses, &c. The rear building, not yet begun, will be for the use of\r\nwomen and children, who now occupy the old hospital. Let us look first\r\nat the central division. We enter a spacious hall tiled with marble. A\r\nsmaller hall, leading out of it, connects with one or two\r\nreception-rooms, where visitors are received, and medicines given out\r\ngratis to poor applicants. A broad staircase of dark wood brings us to\r\nthe wide corridors, on which the wards open, and which look out upon\r\ngreen gardens enclosed between the buildings, where convalescents may be\r\nseen strolling about, or resting in the shade. At the first ward we are\r\nreceived by a Sister of Charity, who, in the absence of the Superior, is\r\nto show us the establishment. A description of one ward will answer for\r\nall, since they are identical. It is a long, lofty room, the beds in\r\nrows on either side, facing outward, and having a broad, open space down\r\nthe centre. The beds are arranged two and two in pairs, each pair being\r\ndivided by a door or window. Between every two beds is a little niche in\r\nthe wall, with a shelf to draw out underneath. In the niche are one or\r\ntwo pitchers or goblets holding the patient’s drink; on the shelf is his\r\nmug, ready to his hand. To a height of some six or eight feet the wall\r\nis wainscoted with blue-and-white porcelain tiles. They are easily\r\nwashed, do not contract dampness, and look very cool and fresh. The\r\nfloor is made of the dark Brazilian wood, partly inlaid, and waxed\r\ncarefully; not a stain is to be seen anywhere on its shining surface.\r\nThe bedding consists of a well-stuffed straw-mattress below, with a\r\nthick hair-mattress above. The sheets and pillow-cases are spotless.\r\nIndeed, everything in this fresh, well-aired, spacious room bespeaks an\r\nexquisite order and neatness. The bath-rooms are in convenient relation\r\nto the wards, furnished with large marble bath-tubs, and with hot and\r\ncold water in abundance. From the public wards we pass into large\r\ncorridors, upon which open private apartments for the use of persons\r\nwho, not having convenient arrangements at home, or being strangers in\r\nthe city, prefer, in case of illness, to go to the hospital. The rent of\r\nthese chambers is exceedingly moderate;—for a room to one’s self, $1.50\r\na day; for a room shared with one other person, $1 a day; for a bed in a\r\nlarger room occupied by half a dozen, but withdrawn from the general\r\nthrong, 75 cents. These charges include medical attendance, nursing, and\r\nfood. From the wards devoted to ordinary diseases, fevers and the like,\r\nwe went to the surgical wards. It need not be said that here the same\r\nneatness and care prevailed; the operating rooms, the surgery lined with\r\ncases containing instruments, lint, bandages, &c. were all in faultless\r\norder.\r\n\r\nFrom this building—looking, as we went, into the kitchen, where the\r\ncontents of the great shiny copper kettles smelt very invitingly—we\r\npassed through a paved court to the old hospital, in which are the wards\r\nfor women and children. This gave us an opportunity of comparing, at\r\nleast in its general arrangement, the ancient establishment with the\r\nmodern one. The neatness and order prevailing throughout make even this\r\npart of the hospital attractive and cheerful; but one feels at once the\r\ndifference between the high, airy rooms and open corridors of the new\r\nbuilding and the more confined quarters of the old one. In both parts of\r\nthe hospital the mingling of color impresses the stranger. Blacks and\r\nwhites lie side by side, and the proportion of negroes is considerable,\r\nboth among the men and women.\r\n\r\nThe charity of the Misericordia is a very comprehensive one; it includes\r\nnot only maladies susceptible of cure, but has also its ward for old and\r\ninfirm persons, who will never leave it except for their last home. The\r\nday before our visit a very aged woman had been buried thence, who had\r\nlived under this roof for seventeen years. There is also a provision for\r\nchildren whose parents die in the hospital, and who have no natural\r\nprotector. They remain there, receive an elementary education, being\r\ntaught to read, write, and cipher; and are not turned into the world\r\nuntil they are of age to marry or to enter into service. There is a\r\nchapel connected with the hospital, and many of the wards are furnished\r\nwith an altar at one end, above which is placed a statue of the Virgin,\r\na crucifix, or a picture of some saint. I could not help asking myself\r\nif regular religious services would not be a wise addition to all\r\ncharitable institutions of this kind, whether Protestant or Catholic. To\r\nthe respectable poor, their church is a great deal. Many a convalescent\r\nwould be glad to hear the Sunday hymn, to join in the prayer put up for\r\nhis recovery; and would think himself the better, body and soul, because\r\nhe had listened to a sermon. To be sure, in our country, where creeds\r\nare so various, and almost every patient might have his own doctrinal\r\nspeciality, there might be some difficulties which do not exist where\r\nthere is a state religion, and one form of service is sure to suit all.\r\nStill, many would be comforted and consoled, and would come without\r\nasking whether the clergyman were of this or that denomination, if they\r\nfelt him to be genuine and truly devout.\r\n\r\nI have presented the old hospital and the present one in direct\r\ncontrast, because the comparison gives a measure of the progress which,\r\nin some directions at least, has taken place during the last thirty or\r\nforty years in Rio de Janeiro. It is true, that all their institutions\r\nhave not advanced in proportion to their benevolent establishments;\r\ncharity, like hospitality, may be said to be a national virtue among the\r\nBrazilians. They hold almsgiving a religious duty, and are more liberal\r\nto their churches and to the public charities connected with them than\r\nto their institutions of learning. Unhappily, a great deal of their\r\nliberality of this kind is expended upon church festas, street\r\nprocessions, saint days, and the like, more calculated to feed\r\nsuperstition than to stimulate pure religious sentiment.\r\n\r\nWe should not leave the Misericordia without some allusion to the man to\r\nwhom it chiefly owes its present character. José Clemente Pereira would\r\nhave been gratefully remembered by the Brazilians as a statesman of\r\ndistinguished merit, who was intimately associated with more than one of\r\nthe most important events in their history, even had he no other claim\r\non their esteem. He was born in Portugal, and distinguished himself as a\r\nyoung man in the Peninsular war. Though he was already twenty-eight\r\nyears of age when he left Europe, he seems to have been as true a lover\r\nof Brazil as if born on her soil. His merit was soon recognized in his\r\nadopted country, and he occupied, at different times, some of the\r\nhighest offices of the realm. The early part of his political career\r\nfell upon the stormy times when Brazil was struggling for her national\r\nexistence as an independent Empire; but during the more tranquil close\r\nof his life he seems to have been chiefly occupied in works of\r\nbenevolence, in founding charitable institutions, and even in personal\r\nattendance upon the sick and suffering.\r\n\r\nThe name of this benevolent Brazilian is associated not only with the\r\nMisericordia hospital, but also with the admirable asylum for the insane\r\nat Botafogo, which bears the name of the present Emperor. A great part\r\nof the funds for this establishment were obtained in an original way,\r\nwhich shows that Pereira knew how to turn the weaknesses of his\r\ncountrymen to good account. The Brazilians are addicted to titles, and\r\nthe government offered distinctions of this kind to wealthy citizens who\r\nwould endow the insane asylum. They were to be either commendadores or\r\nbarons, the importance of the title being in proportion to the magnitude\r\nof their donations. Large sums were actually obtained in this way, and\r\nseveral of the titled men of Rio thus purchased their patents of\r\nnobility. When I first arrived in Rio de Janeiro, mere chance led me to\r\nvisit this asylum. Entering as a stranger, I saw only the outer rooms,\r\nlistened to the evening service in the chapel for a few moments, and was\r\nstruck with the order and quiet which seemed to prevail. It certainly\r\nnever would have occurred to me that I was in an insane hospital. To-day\r\nMr. Agassiz and myself, accompanied by our friend Dr. Pacheco da Silva,\r\npassed several hours there, and saw the whole establishment in detail.\r\nThe building faces upon Botafogo Bay, having the beach immediately\r\nbefore it; on its right the picturesque gap, one side of which is made\r\nby the Paō de Assucar, and on its left the beautiful valley running up\r\ntoward Corcovado. Thus, looking on the sea and surrounded by mountains,\r\nit commands exquisite views on every side. The plan of the building, in\r\nits general arrangement, is not unlike that of the Misericordia. It is a\r\nhandsome solid stone structure, rather long in proportion to its height,\r\nand consists of two parallel buildings, connected by cross corridors.\r\nThese corridors enclose courts, planted with trees and flowers, and\r\nmaking very pleasant gardens. The entrance hall is in the centre, and\r\nhas on either side the statues of Pinel and Esquirol, the two French\r\nmasters in the treatment of mental diseases. The statues have no merit\r\nas works of art; but it was pleasant to see them there, as showing a\r\nrecognition of what these men have done for science and for humanity. A\r\nbroad, low staircase of dark wood leads up to the chapel. Here we looked\r\nwith interest at the ornaments on the altar, because they are the work\r\nof the patients, who take great pleasure in making artificial flowers\r\nand other decorations for the church. On the same floor with the chapel\r\nis a large hall, where stands the statue of the youthful Emperor Dom\r\nPedro Segundo. Opposite to it is that of Pereira. It is worthy of note\r\nthat this statue was presented by the Emperor, and at his request placed\r\nopposite his own. The face, quite in keeping with the history of the\r\nman, is expressive both of great benevolence and remarkable decision.\r\nConnected with this hall are several reception-halls, parlors, and\r\nantechambers; indeed, too much room is assigned to mere state apartments\r\nin an establishment where space must be precious. One of this suite of\r\nrooms was devoted to the various fancy-work made by the\r\npatients,—embroidery of all sorts, artificial flowers and the like.\r\nThence we passed to the wards. As in the Misericordia, the rooms are\r\nvery large and high, wainscoted with tiles, and opening upon wide\r\ncorridors, which look out into the enclosed gardens. Some of the\r\ndormitories have fifteen or twenty beds, but many of the sleeping-rooms\r\nare smaller, it being better, no doubt, to separate the patients at\r\nnight. We saw but little indication of suffering or distress among them.\r\nThere were one or two cases of religious melancholy, with the look of\r\nfixed, absorbed sadness characteristic of that form of insanity. We were\r\nmet once or twice by the vacant stare, and heard the senseless chatter\r\nand laugh always to be found in these saddest of all asylums for human\r\nsuffering. But, on the whole, an air of cheerfulness prevailed; with few\r\nexceptions all the patients were occupied, the women with plain sewing\r\nor embroidery, the men with carpentering, shoemaking, or tailoring,\r\nmaking cigars for the use of the establishment, or picking over old\r\ncordage. The Superior told us that occupation was found to be the most\r\nefficient remedy, and that though work was not compulsory, with few\r\nexceptions all the patients preferred to share in it. The whole service\r\nof the house—washing, sweeping, waxing the floors, cleaning the chambers\r\nand putting them in order—is performed by them. Sunday is found to be\r\nthe most difficult day, because much of the ordinary occupation is\r\nsuspended, and the patients become unruly in proportion as they are\r\nunemployed. From these apartments, where all were busy and comparatively\r\nquiet, we passed to a corridor enclosing a large court, where some of\r\nthe lunatics, too restless for employment, were walking about,\r\ngesticulating and talking loudly. The corridor was lined on its inner\r\nside with chambers devoted to the use of those whose violence made it\r\nnecessary to confine them. The doors and windows were grated, the rooms\r\nempty of furniture, but well lighted, spacious, and airy; not at all\r\nlike cells, except in being so strongly secured. They were mostly\r\nwithout occupants; but as we passed one of them a man rushed to the\r\ndoor, and called out to us that he was not a prisoner because he was\r\nmad, but that he had killed Lopez, and was now the rightful Emperor of\r\nBrazil. This corridor led us to the bath-rooms, which are really on a\r\nmagnificent scale. A number of immense marble tubs are sunk in the tiled\r\nfloors. They are of different depths, adapted for standing, sitting, or\r\nlying down, and have every variety of arrangement for douche, shower, or\r\nsponge baths.\r\n\r\nThis hospital, like the Misericordia, is under the care of the Sisters\r\nof Charity, and is a model of neatness and order. The Superior has a\r\nface remarkable for its serenity, expressive at once of sweetness and\r\ngood sense. From her we learned some interesting facts respecting\r\ninsanity in this country. She says furious maniacs are rare, and that\r\nviolence generally yields readily to treatment. She also told us that\r\ninsanity is more common among the poor than among the better classes.\r\nThough the asylum contains apartments for private patients, there are\r\nseldom more than eight or ten persons of this description to occupy\r\nthem. This is not because they have any choice of establishments, for\r\nthere is no other insane hospital in Rio de Janeiro, though there are\r\none or two “Maisons de Santé” where insane persons are received. There\r\nwere more blacks among the patients than we had expected to see, the\r\ngeneral impression being that insanity is rare among the negroes. We\r\nleft this hospital impressed by its superiority. A country which has so\r\nhigh a standard of excellence in its charities can hardly fail, sooner\r\nor later, to bring its institutions of learning and its public works\r\ngenerally up to the same level. Excellence in one department leads to\r\nexcellence in all.\r\n\r\nFrom the hospital we continued our walk to the military school, some\r\nquarter of a mile farther. It stands in the gap between the Paō de\r\nAssucar and the opposite range of hills, and has the Botafogo Bay on one\r\nside, the Praia Vermelha on the other. Here, as elsewhere in the public\r\nschools of Rio de Janeiro, there is a progressive movement; but old and\r\ntheoretical methods still prevail to a great degree. The maps are poor;\r\nthere are no bas-reliefs, no large globes, few dissections or chemical\r\nanalyses, no philosophical experiments, and no library deserving the\r\nname. The school, however, has been in efficient operation only six\r\nyears, and improvements in the building, as well as in the apparatus for\r\ninstruction, are made daily. So far as its domestic economy is\r\nconcerned, the appointments of the establishment are excellent; indeed,\r\none is rather inclined to criticise it as over-luxurious for boys\r\neducated to be soldiers. The school-rooms and dormitories, as well as\r\nthe dining-room, where the tables were laid with a nice service of\r\ncrockery and glass, and also the kitchens, were clean and orderly. We\r\ncannot but wonder that the streets of Rio de Janeiro should be dirtier\r\nand more offensive than those of any other city we have visited, when we\r\nsee the scrupulous neatness characteristic of all its public\r\nestablishments. The observance of cleanliness in this respect shows that\r\nthe Brazilians recognize its importance, and it seems strange that they\r\nshould tolerate nuisances in their streets which make it almost\r\nimpossible to pass through many of them on foot.\r\n\r\n_June 7th._—Yesterday we visited the Mint, the Academy of Fine Arts, and\r\na primary school for girls. Of the Mint it is scarcely fair to judge in\r\nits present condition; a new building is nearly completed, and all\r\nimprovements in machinery are wisely deferred until the establishment is\r\nremoved. When this change takes place, much that is antiquated will be\r\nimproved, and its many deficiencies supplied.\r\n\r\nThere is little knowledge of, or interest in, art in Brazil. Pictures\r\nare as rare as books in a Brazilian house; and though Rio de Janeiro has\r\nan Academy of Fine Arts, including a school of design and sculpture, it\r\nis still in too elementary a condition to warrant criticism. The only\r\ninteresting picture in the collection derives its attraction wholly from\r\nthe circumstances connected with it, not at all from any merit in the\r\nexecution. It is a likeness of a negro who, in a shipwreck off the\r\ncoast, saved a number of lives at the risk of his own. When he had\r\nbrought several passengers to the shore, he was told that two children\r\nremained in the ship. He swam back once more and brought them safely to\r\nthe beach, but sank down himself exhausted, and was seized with\r\nhemorrhage. A considerable sum was raised for him in the city of Rio,\r\nand his picture was placed in the Academy to commemorate his heroism.\r\n\r\nOf the public school for girls not much can be said. The education of\r\nwomen is little regarded in Brazil, and the standard of instruction for\r\ngirls in the public schools is low. Even in the private schools, where\r\nthe children of the better class are sent, it is the complaint of all\r\nteachers that they are taken away from school just at the time when\r\ntheir minds begin to develop. The majority of girls in Brazil who go to\r\nschool at all are sent at about seven or eight years of age, and are\r\nconsidered to have finished their education at thirteen or fourteen. The\r\nnext step in their life is marriage. Of course there are exceptions;\r\nsome parents wisely leave their children at school, or direct their\r\ninstruction at home, till they are seventeen or eighteen years of age,\r\nand others send their girls abroad. But usually, with the exception of\r\none or two accomplishments, such as French or music, the education of\r\nwomen is neglected, and this neglect affects the whole tone of society.\r\nIt does not change the general truth of this statement, that there are\r\nBrazilian ladies who would be recognized in the best society as women of\r\nthe highest intelligence and culture. But they are the exceptions, as\r\nthey inevitably must be under the present system of instruction, and\r\nthey feel its influence upon their social position only the more\r\nbitterly.\r\n\r\nIndeed, many of the women I have known most intimately here have spoken\r\nto me with deep regret of their limited, imprisoned existence. There is\r\nnot a Brazilian senhora, who has ever thought about the subject at all,\r\nwho is not aware that her life is one of repression and constraint. She\r\ncannot go out of her house, except under certain conditions, without\r\nawakening scandal. Her education leaves her wholly ignorant of the most\r\ncommon topics of a wider interest, though perhaps with a tolerable\r\nknowledge of French and music. The world of books is closed to her; for\r\nthere is little Portuguese literature into which she is allowed to look,\r\nand that of other languages is still less at her command. She knows\r\nlittle of the history of her own country, almost nothing of that of\r\nothers, and she is hardly aware that there is any religious faith except\r\nthe uniform one of Brazil; she has probably never heard of the\r\nReformation, nor does she dream that there is a sea of thought surging\r\nin the world outside, constantly developing new phases of national and\r\nindividual life; indeed, of all but her own narrow domestic existence\r\nshe is profoundly ignorant.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion, when staying at a fazenda, I took up a volume which was\r\nlying on the piano. A book is such a rare sight, in the rooms occupied\r\nby the family, that I was curious to see its contents. As I stood\r\nturning over the leaves (it proved to be a romance), the master of the\r\nhouse came up, and remarked that the book was not suitable reading for\r\nladies, but that here (putting into my hand a small volume) was a work\r\nadapted to the use of women and children, which he had provided for the\r\nsenhoras of his family. I opened it, and found it to be a sort of\r\ntextbook of morals, filled with commonplace sentiments, copybook\r\nphrases, written in a tone of condescending indulgence for the feminine\r\nintellect. Women being, after all, the mothers of men, and understood to\r\nhave some little influence on their education, I could hardly wonder,\r\nafter seeing this specimen of their intellectual food, that the wife and\r\ndaughters of our host were not greatly addicted to reading. Nothing\r\nstrikes a stranger more than the absence of books in Brazilian houses.\r\nIf the father is a professional man, he has his small library of\r\nmedicine or law, but books are never seen scattered about as if in\r\ncommon use; they make no part of the daily life. I repeat, that there\r\nare exceptions. I well remember finding in the sitting-room of a young\r\ngirl, by whose family we had been most cordially received, a\r\nwell-selected library of the best literary and historical works in\r\nGerman and French; but this is the only instance of the kind we met with\r\nduring our year in Brazil. Even when the Brazilian women have received\r\nthe ordinary advantages of education, there is something in their\r\nhome-life so restricted, so shut out from natural contact with external\r\ninfluences, that this in itself tends to cripple their development.\r\nTheir amusements are as meagre and scanty as their means of instruction.\r\n\r\nIn writing these things I but echo the thought of many intelligent\r\nBrazilians, who lament a social evil which they do not well know how to\r\nreform. If among our Brazilian friends there are some who, familiar with\r\nthe more progressive aspect of life in Rio de Janeiro, question the\r\naccuracy of my statements, I can only say that they do not know the\r\ncondition of society in the northern cities and provinces. Among my own\r\nsex, I have never seen such sad lives as became known to me there,—lives\r\ndeprived of healthy, invigorating happiness, and intolerably\r\nmonotonous,—a negative suffering, having its source, it is true, in the\r\nabsence of enjoyment rather than in the presence of positive evils, but\r\nall the more to be deplored because so stagnant and inactive.\r\n\r\nBehind all defects in methods of instruction, there lies a fault of\r\ndomestic education, to be lamented throughout Brazil. This is the\r\nconstant association with black servants, and, worse still, with negro\r\nchildren, of whom there are usually a number in every house. Whether the\r\nlow and vicious habits of the negroes are the result of slavery or not,\r\nthey cannot be denied; and it is singular to see persons, otherwise\r\ncareful and conscientious about their children, allowing them to live in\r\nthe constant companionship of their blacks, waited upon by the older\r\nones, playing all day with the younger ones. It shows how blind we may\r\nbecome, by custom, to the most palpable dangers. A stranger observes at\r\nonce the evil results of this contact with vulgarity and vice, though\r\noften unnoticed by the parents. In the capital, some of these evils are\r\nfast disappearing; indeed, those who remember Rio de Janeiro forty years\r\nago have witnessed, during that short period, a remarkable change for\r\nthe better in the state of society. Nor should it be forgotten that the\r\nhighest authority in the community is exerted in the cause of a liberal\r\nculture for women. It is well known that the education of the Imperial\r\nprincesses has been not only superintended, but in a great measure\r\npersonally conducted, by their father.\r\n\r\n_July 8th._—I was prevented yesterday from going to the Blind Asylum\r\nwith Mr. Agassiz, but I transcribe his notes upon this, as well as upon\r\nthe Marine Arsenal, which he also visited without me.\r\n\r\n“The building is old and in a ruinous condition. I was not allowed to go\r\nover it, everything being brought to the reception-room for my\r\ninspection, though I told the director that I did not care about the\r\nexternal arrangements, but simply wished to know by what means the\r\nprivations of the blind were alleviated in his establishment. The same\r\nprocesses of routine prevail here as in other schools and colleges I\r\nhave seen in Rio. This, however, is not peculiar to Portuguese or\r\nBrazilian habits of instruction. The old habit of overrating memory, and\r\nneglecting the more active and productive faculties of the mind, still\r\nprevails more or less in education everywhere. I learned little of the\r\ngeneral system pursued. The teachers were more anxious to show off the\r\nability of special pupils in reading, writing from dictation, and music,\r\nthan to explain their methods of instruction. Vocal and instrumental\r\nmusic seemed the favorite occupation; but though it is very pathetic to\r\nhear the blind deplore their misfortune and express their craving for\r\nlight in harmonious sounds, it does not, after all, give much\r\ninformation as to the way in which their calamity is relieved. I should\r\nadd, that their musical performance is excellent, and does great credit\r\nto their German professor. It struck me that very little use was made of\r\nobject-teaching, such as is so much in vogue for children in Germany.\r\nThere are not as many models in the whole establishment as would be\r\nfound in any nursery in certain parts of Germany. The maps also are very\r\npoor.\r\n\r\n“One of the most interesting of the public establishments at Rio de\r\nJaneiro is the Marine Arsenal. From the Gulf of Mexico to Cape Horn\r\nthere is not to be found on the Atlantic coast another port where a\r\nvessel of war, or even a merchant vessel of large tonnage, could undergo\r\nimportant repairs. The machine-shops and saw-mills are well directed,\r\nand are deficient in none of the improvements belonging to modern\r\nestablishments of the kind. The dock is large and constructed of\r\ngranite. A considerable number of large vessels have been built at this\r\nshipyard during the last few years, and all its appointments have been\r\nconstantly improving under the direction of several successive ministers\r\nof the navy. Such an establishment is, in fact, a necessity for Brazil;\r\npossessing as she does eleven hundred leagues of coast, it is impossible\r\nfor her to depend upon other countries for her maritime supplies. The\r\nMarine Arsenal sends out from its school and shipyard many able\r\nengineers and clever artisans, who carry into ordinary branches of\r\nindustry the ability they have acquired in the public service. Indeed,\r\nthis establishment may be considered as a sort of school of industrial\r\narts, furnishing the country with good workmen in various departments of\r\nlabor.”\r\n\r\nThis week Mr. Agassiz has concluded another course of six lectures given\r\nat the College of Dom Pedro II.; the subject, “The Formation of the\r\nAmazonian Valley, and its Productions.” It is worthy of remark, that the\r\nappearance of ladies on such occasions no longer excites comment. There\r\nwere many more senhoras among the listeners than at the previous\r\nlectures, when their presence was a novelty. A Brazilian audience is\r\nvery sympathetic; in this they resemble a European assembly more than\r\nour own quiet, undemonstrative crowds. There is always a little stir, a\r\nresponsive thrill, when anything pleases them, and often a spoken word\r\nof commendation or criticism.\r\n\r\n_June 10th._—Theresopolis. Yesterday, accompanied by Mr. Glaziou,\r\nDirector of the Passeio Publico, and Dr. Nägeli, we started on an\r\nexcursion to the Organ Mountains, leaving Rio in the boat for Piedade,\r\nand stopping on our way at the little island of Paquetá. This is one of\r\nthe prettiest islands of the harbor, abounding in palms, populous with\r\npleasant country-houses, and having a very picturesque shore, broken\r\ninto bays and inlets. We reached the little cluster of houses called\r\nPiedade about five o’clock, and took the omnibus to the foot of the\r\nserra. The hours of public conveyance on this road seem ingeniously\r\narranged to prevent the traveller from seeing its beauties. The greater\r\npart of the four hours’ drive is made after nightfall; and the return\r\noffers no compensation, the second journey taking place before daybreak.\r\nWe passed the night at the foot of the serra, and started at seven\r\no’clock the next morning to walk up the mountain. It is impossible to\r\ndescribe the beauty of this walk, especially on such a day as we were\r\nfavored with, varying between sunshine and shade, and with a fresh\r\nbreeze which saved us any discomfort from the heat. The road winds\r\ngently up the serra, turning sometimes with so sharp an angle that below\r\nwe could see all the ground we had travelled over. On one hand is the\r\nmountain-side, clothed with a vegetation of surpassing beauty, bright\r\nwith crimson parasites, with the rich purple flowers of the Quaresma and\r\nthe delicate blue blossoms of the Utricularia, as fragile and as\r\ngraceful as the harebell. On the other hand, we looked down sometimes\r\ninto narrow gorges, clothed with magnificent forest, from which huge\r\nmasses of rock projected here and there; sometimes into wider valleys\r\nopening out into the plain below, and giving a distant view of the\r\nharbor and its archipelago of islands surrounded by mountains, the whole\r\nscene glittering in the sunshine, or veiled by shadows, as the fitful\r\nday showed it to us.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Garrafaō, among the Organ Mountains.]\r\n\r\nThe ascent may be easily accomplished on foot in three or four hours. We\r\nhad nothing to urge us forward, however, except a growing desire for\r\nbreakfast, appeased every now and then by an orange, of which we had a\r\ngood supply in the tin case for plants, and many a slow train of laden\r\nmules passed us in their upward march, and left us far behind as we\r\nloitered along, though not lazily. On the contrary, Mr. Agassiz and his\r\nfriends found plenty of occupation in botanizing and geologizing. They\r\nstopped constantly to gather parasites, to study ferns and mosses, to\r\nbreak boulders, to collect insects and the little land-shells found here\r\nand there along the road. We saw one most beautiful insect, hardly\r\nlarger than a lady-bug, but of the most exquisite colors and gleaming\r\nlike a jewel on the leaf where it had alighted. In breaking the stones\r\nalong the roadside Mr. Agassiz found many evidences of erratics, several\r\nof them being Diorite, entirely distinct from the rock in place. The\r\nsurfaces of the boulders were universally decomposed and covered with a\r\nuniform crust, so that it was necessary to split them in order to\r\nascertain their true nature. From distance to distance along the road\r\nwere immense fragments of rock, sometimes twenty or thirty feet in\r\nheight. These huge masses were frequently seen hanging on the brink of\r\nsteep declivities, as if, having broken off from the heights above, and\r\nrolled down, they had been prevented from advancing farther by some\r\nobstacle, and had become gradually embedded in the soil. Many of these\r\nboulders were clothed in soft, thick reindeer moss, so like the reindeer\r\nmoss of the Arctics that, if specifically distinct, the difference could\r\nnot be detected except by the most careful examination. It suggests the\r\nquestion whether there are any representatives of the tropical flora\r\namong the lichens and pines of the high north. As we advanced, the\r\ncharacter of the vegetation changed considerably, and we began to feel,\r\nby the increasing freshness of the air, that we were getting into higher\r\nregions. The near view became more beautiful as we approached the heart\r\nof the mountains, coming under the shadow of their strange peaks, which\r\nlooked sharp and attenuated from a distance, but changed into wonderful\r\nmasses of bare rock, very grand in their effect, as we drew closer to\r\nthem. We reached the hotel at Theresopolis at about two o’clock. After\r\nour long walk, the answer we received to our inquiry about breakfast at\r\nthe little grocery adjoining the inn was rather discouraging. What could\r\nthey give us on short notice? “Only four eggs and some sausage.”\r\nHowever, the master of the hotel made his appearance, opened his house,\r\nwhere, to judge from its closed doors and windows, the advent of guests\r\nis rare, and comforted us with the information that breakfast “pode se\r\narranjar.” Indeed, from the dish of eggs which made its appearance soon\r\nafterwards, we might have supposed that all the hens in the village had\r\nbeen called upon to contribute, and we enjoyed a breakfast for which\r\nmountain air and exercise had supplied the best sauce.\r\n\r\nThe village of Theresopolis is very prettily situated, lying in a dip\r\nbetween the mountains and commanding a magnificent view of the peaks,\r\none of which stands out like a tall, narrow tower against the sky. Near\r\nit is another sharp summit, on the extreme point of which a large\r\nboulder is placed. It looks as if a touch would dislodge it; and yet for\r\nhow many a long year has it held its place there through storm and\r\nsunshine! We looked up at this huge fragment of rock on its dizzy\r\nheight, and wondered whether it was erratic, or simply an effect of\r\ndecomposition on the spot,—a point impossible of decision at that\r\ndistance. If the latter, it seems strange that the weather should have\r\nworn and excavated such a mass underneath, without destroying its upper\r\nsurface, thus detaching it from the mountain, till it stands, as now, in\r\nbold relief, only supported by a single point of attachment on the\r\nextreme summit. We spent the rest of the day in a walk to a very pretty\r\ncascade which comes rushing down through the wood a mile or two from the\r\nvillage.\r\n\r\n_June 11th._—We left the inn at half past seven this morning, to pass\r\nthe day again in rambling. Following the main road for a quarter of a\r\nmile or so beyond the village, we presently turned to the left into a\r\nnarrow, shady pathway. It led us through the woods to the edge of a deep\r\nbasin sunk between the mountains, on the slopes of which were strewn\r\nmany immense boulders. A curious feature of the Organ Mountains which we\r\nhave observed repeatedly even in this short excursion is, that between\r\ntheir strangely fantastic forms the country sinks down into well-defined\r\nbasins, which usually have no outlet. Following the brink of such a\r\nbasin for a couple of miles, and crossing an intervening ridge, we came\r\nout upon a kind of plateau overhanging another depression of the same\r\ncharacter, and commanding a magnificent view of the chain, in the very\r\ncentre of which it seems to be, for the mountains rise tier upon tier\r\naround it on every side. On this plateau stands the fazenda called St.\r\nLouis, belonging to Mr. d’Escragnolle. The exquisite beauty of the site\r\nand the hospitality of its owner have made this fazenda a favorite\r\nresort for travellers. The grounds are laid out with much taste, and Mr.\r\nd’Escragnolle’s success in raising many of the European fruits and\r\nvegetables, as well as those of his own country, makes it the more to be\r\nregretted that this beautiful region should be so little cultivated.\r\nPears, peaches, strawberries, thrive admirably, as also do green peas,\r\nasparagus, artichokes, and cauliflowers. The climate strikes a happy\r\nmedium between the heat in the neighborhood of Rio de Janeiro, which\r\nbrings these products to too rapid a development, drying them up before\r\nthey have time to mature, and the sharp cold of higher mountain regions.\r\nBut though at so short a distance from the capital, the transport is so\r\ndifficult and expensive that Mr. d’Escragnolle, instead of sending the\r\nproduce of his farm to the city market, as he would gladly do, feeds his\r\npigs with cauliflowers. We passed the rest of the day most delightfully\r\nin this charming country place. Mr. Agassiz and Mr. Glaziou ascended one\r\nof the near mountain summits, but did not gain so extensive a view as\r\nthey had hoped, on account of an intervening spur. They were able to\r\ndistinguish three parallel ridges, however, separated by intervening\r\ndepressions. Toward evening, while the mountains were still bright with\r\nthe purple glory of the sunset, though shadows were settling over the\r\nvalleys, we started on our return, bidding good by with great regret to\r\nour kind host, who warmly pressed us to stay. The path we had followed\r\nin the morning, without giving a thought to its irregularities, seemed\r\nquite broken and difficult by night. The slopes along which it ran were\r\nchanged, in the dim light, to sudden precipices, and we picked our steps\r\nwith care between rocks and over fallen logs and rivulets. It was bright\r\nstarlight as we came out of the woods upon the high road. The village\r\nlay below, its lights twinkling cheerily, and the peaks and towers\r\nbehind it drawn with strange distinctness against the night sky.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Organ Mountains.]\r\n\r\n_June 12th._—Barreira. This morning at seven o’clock we were on our way\r\ndown the serra. Mr. Agassiz deplores the necessity which obliges him to\r\nleave this region after so short an examination of its striking\r\nfeatures. A naturalist might pass months here, and find every day rich\r\nin results. As we left the hotel the sun was just gilding the highest\r\nsummits, while white clouds rose softly from the valleys, and, floating\r\nupward, broke into fleecy fragments against the mountain-sides. Having\r\nthe day before us, we descended as slowly as we had mounted the serra,\r\nstopping almost at every step to gather plants, to examine rocks, to\r\nwonder at the strange position of the immense boulders hanging often\r\njust on the brow of some steep declivity. I wandered on beyond the\r\nothers and sat down to wait for them on the low stone wall, forming a\r\nparapet on the edge of the road. Directly before me rose the bare, rocky\r\nsurface of one of the great peaks; a vapory white cloud hung midway upon\r\nit; shadows floated over it. On the other side I looked down upon wooded\r\nvalleys and mountains in strange confusion, while far below, stretching\r\nout to the sea, lay the billowy plain tossed into endless soft green\r\nwaves. The stillness made the scene more impressive, the silence being\r\nonly occasionally broken by the click of hoofs, as a train of mules came\r\ncautiously down the flagged road. While I sat there a liteira passed me\r\nslung between mules; a mode of travelling fast disappearing with the\r\nimprovements of the roads, but still in use for women and children in\r\ncertain parts of the country. We stopped to breakfast at a little venda\r\nabout half-way down the serra; here the boulders are most remarkable\r\nfrom their great size and singular position. We reached the inn at the\r\nbottom of the serra between two and three o’clock, and are now sitting\r\nin the little piazza, while a drenching rain, which fortunately did not\r\nbegin till we were under shelter, swells the stream near by, and is fast\r\nchanging it to a rapid torrent. I will add here such observations\r\nrespecting the geological structure of this mountain range as Mr.\r\nAgassiz has been able to make in our short excursion.\r\n\r\n“The chain is formed by the sharp folding up of strata, sometimes quite\r\nvertically, in other instances with a slope more or less steep, but\r\nalways rather sudden. To one standing on the hill to the east of\r\nTheresopolis, the whole range presents itself in a perfect profile; the\r\naxis, on either side of which dip the almost vertical beds of\r\nmetamorphic rocks composing the chain, occupies about the centre of the\r\nrange. To the north, though very steeply inclined, the beds are not so\r\nvertical as in the southern prolongation of the range. The consequence\r\nof this difference is the formation of more massive and less\r\ndisconnected summits on the north side; while on the south side, where\r\nthe strata are nearly or quite vertical, the harder sets of beds alone\r\nhave remained standing, the softer intervening beds having been\r\ngradually disintegrated. By this process have been formed those strange\r\npeaks which appear from a distance like a row of organ-pipes, and have\r\nsuggested the name by which the chain is known. They consist of vertical\r\nbeds isolated from the general mass in consequence of the disappearance\r\nof contiguous strata. The aspect of these mountains from Rio is much the\r\nsame as from Theresopolis, only that from the two points of view—one\r\nbeing to the northeast, the other to the southwest of the range—their\r\nsummits present themselves in the reverse order. When seen in complete\r\nprofile their slender appearance is most striking. Viewed from the side,\r\nthe broad surfaces of the strata, though equally steep, exhibit a\r\ntriangular form rather than that of vertical columns. It is strange that\r\nthe height of the Organ Mountain peaks, so conspicuous a feature in the\r\nlandscape of Rio de Janeiro, should not have been accurately measured.\r\nThe only precise indication I have been able to find is recorded by\r\nLiais, who gives 7,000 feet as the maximum height observed by him.\r\n\r\n“These abrupt peaks frequently surround closed basins, very symmetrical\r\nin shape, but without any outlet. On account of this singular formation,\r\nthe glacial phenomena which abound in the Organ Mountains are of a\r\npeculiar character. At first, I was at a loss to explain how loose\r\nmasses of rock, descending from the heights above, should be caught on\r\nthe edges of these basins, instead of rolling to the bottom. But their\r\nposition becomes quite natural when we remember that the ice must have\r\nremained in these depressions long after it had disappeared, or nearly\r\ndisappeared, from the slopes above. Hindered from advancing, these huge\r\nmasses of rock have become gradually embedded in the soil, and are now\r\nsolidly fixed in positions which would be perfectly inexplicable, unless\r\nwe suppose the basin to have been formerly filled with something which\r\noffered an obstacle to their farther descent. Moraines also abut upon\r\nthese depressions, coming to an abrupt close upon their margin. Morainic\r\nsoil—that is, masses of drift with all sorts of loose materials buried\r\nin it—abounds everywhere in this region; but, on the whole, the glacial\r\nphenomena are difficult to study, because the heavy growth of forest has\r\ncovered all inequalities of the soil, and, except where sections have\r\nbeen made or ground has been cleared, the outlines are lost.”\r\n\r\nThis was our final excursion in Brazil. The next morning we returned to\r\nthe city; and the few remaining days were spent in preparations for\r\ndeparture, and in bidding farewell to the friends who had made Rio de\r\nJaneiro almost like a home to us. Among the pleasant incidents of this\r\nlast week, was a breakfast given by Mr. Ledgerwood, who was then\r\nconducting the business of the American legation in the temporary\r\nabsence of our Minister, General Webb. This occasion, at which Mr.\r\nAgassiz was invited to meet several members of the Brazilian\r\nadministration, gave him an opportunity of expressing his sense of their\r\nuniform kindness and consideration in furthering to the utmost the\r\nscientific objects which had brought him to Brazil. On the following day\r\n(the 2d of July), we sailed for the United States, carrying with us to\r\nour northern home a store of pleasant memories and vivid pictures to\r\nenrich our life hereafter with tropical warmth and color.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVI.\r\n                     GENERAL IMPRESSIONS OF BRAZIL.\r\n\r\n  RELIGION AND CLERGY.—EDUCATION.—LAW, MEDICAL, AND SCIENTIFIC\r\n    SCHOOLS.—HIGH AND COMMON SCHOOLS.—PUBLIC LIBRARY AND MUSEUM IN RIO\r\n    DE JANEIRO.—HISTORICAL AND GEOGRAPHICAL INSTITUTE.—SOCIAL AND\r\n    DOMESTIC RELATIONS.—PUBLIC FUNCTIONARIES.—AGRICULTURE.—ZONES OF\r\n    VEGETATION.—COFFEE.—COTTON.—TIMBER AND OTHER PRODUCTS OF THE\r\n    AMAZONS.—CATTLE.—TERRITORIAL SUBDIVISION OF THE GREAT\r\n    VALLEY.—EMIGRATION.—FOREIGNERS.—PARAGUAYAN WAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nI cannot close this book, written for the most part by another hand,\r\nwithout a few words as to my general impressions of Brazil. No one will\r\nexpect from me an essay on the social and political aspects of the whole\r\ncountry, even had I remained there long enough to acquire the right of\r\njudgment on these matters. I am so unaccustomed to dealing with them\r\nthat my opinions would be entitled to little weight. There is, however,\r\nanother point of view, more general, but perhaps more comprehensive\r\nalso, from which every intelligent man may form an estimate of the\r\ncharacter of a people which, if sincere, will be in the main sound and\r\njust, without including an intimate knowledge of their institutions, or\r\nthe practical working of their laws. My scientific life has brought me\r\ninto relations with a world wholly unknown to me before; under\r\nconditions more favorable than were possible for my predecessors in the\r\nsame region, I have studied this tropical nature, so rich, so grandiose,\r\nso instructive; I have seen a great Empire founded in the midst of\r\nunlimited material resources, and advancing to higher civilization under\r\nthe inspiration of a sovereign as enlightened as he is humane. I must\r\nhave been blind to everything except my science, had I not a word to say\r\nof Brazil as a nation,—of her present condition and her future\r\nprospects.\r\n\r\nThere is much that is discouraging in the aspect of Brazil, even for\r\nthose who hope and believe as I do, that she has before her an honorable\r\nand powerful career. There is much also that is very cheering, that\r\nleads me to believe that her life as a nation will not belie her great\r\ngifts as a country. Should her moral and intellectual endowments grow\r\ninto harmony with her wonderful natural beauty and wealth, the world\r\nwill not have seen a fairer land. At present there are several obstacles\r\nto this progress; obstacles which act like a moral disease upon the\r\npeople. Slavery still exists among them. It is true that it is on the\r\nwane; true that it has received a mortal blow; but the natural death of\r\nslavery is a lingering illness, wasting and destroying the body it has\r\nattacked. Next to this I would name, among the influences unfavorable to\r\nprogress, the character of the clergy. In saying this I disclaim any\r\nreference to the national religion. It is of the character of the clergy\r\nI speak, not of the church they represent. Whatever be the church\r\norganization in a country where instruction is still so intimately\r\nlinked with a state religion as it is in Brazil, it is of infinite\r\nimportance that the clergy themselves should not only be men of high\r\nmoral character, but of studious, thoughtful lives. They are the\r\nteachers of the people, and as long as they believe that the mind can be\r\nfed with tawdry street processions, with lighted candles, and cheap\r\nbouquets; and as long as the people accept this kind of instruction,\r\nthey will be debased and enfeebled by it. Shows of this kind are of\r\nalmost daily occurrence in all the large cities of Brazil. They\r\ninterfere with the ordinary occupations, and make working days the\r\nexception rather than the rule. It must be remembered that in Brazil\r\nthere is no laborious, cultivated class of priests, such as have been an\r\nhonor to ecclesiastical literature in the Old World; there are no fine\r\ninstitutions of learning connected with the Church. As a general thing,\r\nthe ignorance of the clergy is universal, their immorality patent, their\r\ninfluence very extensive and deep-rooted. There are honorable\r\nexceptions, but they are not numerous enough to elevate the class to\r\nwhich they belong. But if their private life is open to blame, the\r\nBrazilian priests are distinguished for their patriotism. At all times\r\nthey have occupied high public stations, serving in the Legislative\r\nAssembly, in the Senate, and even nearer to the throne; yet their power\r\nhas never been exerted in favor of Ultramontane tendencies. Independent\r\nreligious thought seems, however, rare in Brazil. There may perhaps be\r\nscepticism; but I think this is not likely to be extensively the case,\r\nfor the Brazilians are instinctively a believing people, tending rather\r\nto superstition than to doubt. Oppression in matters of faith is\r\ncontrary to the spirit of their institutions. Protestant clergymen are\r\nallowed to preach freely; but, as a general thing, Protestantism does\r\nnot attract the Southern nations, and it may be doubted whether its\r\nadvocates will have a very wide-spread success. However this may be,\r\nevery friend to Brazil must wish to see its present priesthood replaced\r\nby a more vigorous, intelligent, and laborious clergy.\r\n\r\nIn order to form a just estimate of the present condition of education\r\nin Brazil, and its future prospects, we must not consider it altogether\r\nfrom our own stand-point. The truth is that all steady progress in\r\nBrazil dates from her declaration of independence, and that is a very\r\nrecent fact in her history. Since she has passed from colonial to\r\nnational life her relations with other countries have enlarged,\r\nantiquated prejudices have been effaced, and with a more intense\r\nindividual existence she has assumed also a more cosmopolitan breadth of\r\nideas. But a political revolution is more rapidly accomplished than the\r\nremoulding of the nation which is its result,—its consequence rather\r\nthan its accompaniment. Even now, after half a century of independent\r\nexistence, intellectual progress in Brazil is manifested rather as a\r\ntendency, a desire, so to speak, giving a progressive movement to\r\nsociety, than as a positive fact. The intellectual life of a nation when\r\nfully developed has its material existence in large and various\r\ninstitutions of learning, scattered throughout the country. Except in a\r\nvery limited and local sense, this is not yet the case in Brazil.\r\n\r\nI did not visit San Paolo, and I cannot therefore speak from personal\r\nobservation of the Faculty which stands highest in general estimation; I\r\ncan, however, testify to the sound learning and liberal culture of many\r\nof its graduates whom it has been my good fortune to know, and whose\r\ncharacters as gentlemen and as students bear testimony to the superior\r\ninstruction they have received at the hands of their Alma Mater. I was\r\ntold that the best schools, after those of San Paolo, were those of\r\nBahia and Pernambuco. I did not visit them, as my time was too short;\r\nbut I should think that the presence of the professional faculties\r\nestablished in both these cities would tend to raise the character of\r\nthe lower grades of education. The regular faculties embrace only\r\nmedical and legal studies. The instruction in both is thorough, though\r\nperhaps limited; at least I felt that, in the former, in which my own\r\nstudies have prepared me to judge, those accessory branches which, after\r\nall, lie at the foundation of a superior medical education, are either\r\nwanting or are taught very imperfectly. Neither zoölogy, comparative\r\nanatomy, botany, physics, nor chemistry is allowed sufficient weight in\r\nthe medical schools. The education is one rather of books than of facts.\r\nIndeed, as long as the prejudice against manual labor of all kinds\r\nexists in Brazil, practical instruction will be deficient; as long as\r\nstudents of nature think it unbecoming a gentleman to handle his own\r\nspecimens, to carry his own geological hammer, to make his own\r\nscientific preparations, he will remain a mere dilettante in\r\ninvestigation. He may be very familiar with recorded facts, but he will\r\nmake no original researches. On this account, and on account of their\r\npersonal indolence, field studies are foreign to Brazilian habits.\r\nSurrounded as they are by a nature rich beyond comparison, their\r\nnaturalists are theoretical rather than practical. They know more of the\r\nbibliography of foreign science than of the wonderful fauna and flora\r\nwith which they are surrounded.\r\n\r\nOf the schools and colleges in Rio de Janeiro I have more right to judge\r\nthan of those above mentioned. Several of them are excellent. The Ecole\r\nCentrale deserves a special notice. It corresponds to what we call a\r\nscientific school, and nowhere in Brazil have I seen an educational\r\ninstitution where improved methods of teaching were so highly\r\nappreciated and so generally adopted. The courses of mathematics,\r\nchemistry, physics, and the natural sciences are comprehensive and\r\nthorough. And yet even in this institution I was struck with the\r\nscantiness of means for practical illustration and experiment; its\r\nprofessors do not yet seem to understand that it is impossible to teach\r\nany of the physical sciences wholly or mainly from text-books. The\r\nfacilities granted to pupils in this school, and perhaps still more in\r\nthe military school, are very great. The instruction is entirely\r\ngratuitous, and in the military school the students are not only fed and\r\nclothed, etc.; they are even paid for their attendance, being considered\r\nas belonging to the army from the time they enter the school.\r\n\r\nThe Dom Pedro Segundo College is the best school of that class I have\r\nseen in Brazil. It may be compared to our New England high schools, and\r\nfully deserves the reputation it enjoys.\r\n\r\nOf the common schools I saw little. Of course, in a country where the\r\npopulation is sparsely scattered over very extensive districts, it must\r\nbe difficult to gather the children in schools, outside of the large\r\ncities. Where such schools have been organized the instruction is\r\ngratuitous; but competent teachers are few, the education very limited,\r\nand the means of instruction scanty. Reading, writing, and ciphering,\r\nwith the least possible smattering of geography, form the groundwork of\r\nall these schools. The teachers labor under great difficulties, because\r\nthey have not the strong support of the community. There is little\r\ngeneral appreciation of the importance of education as the basis without\r\nwhich all higher civilization is impossible. I have, however, noticed\r\nthroughout Brazil a disposition to give a practical education, a\r\ntraining in some trade, to the poor children. Establishments of this\r\nkind exist in almost all the larger cities. This is a good sign; it\r\nshows that they attach a proper value to labor, at least for the lower\r\nclasses, and aim at raising a working population. In these schools\r\nblacks and whites are, so to speak, industrially united. Indeed, there\r\nis no antipathy of race to be overcome in Brazil, either among the\r\nlaboring people or in the higher walks of life. I was pleased to see\r\npupils, without distinction of race or color, mingling in the exercises.\r\n\r\nIt is surprising that, in a country so rich in mineral wealth, there\r\nshould exist no special Mining School, and that everything connected\r\nwith the working of the mines should be under the immediate supervision\r\nof the Minister of Public Works, without the assistance of a special\r\noffice for the superintendence of mining operations. Nothing would more\r\nspeedily increase the value of the mineral lands of the whole country\r\nthan a regular geological survey, which has not yet been begun.[107]\r\n\r\nThe Imperial Library at Rio de Janeiro should not be omitted from an\r\nenumeration of its educational establishments. It is very fairly\r\nsupplied with books in all departments of learning, and is conducted in\r\na very liberal spirit, suffering no limitation from religious or\r\npolitical prejudice. In fact, tolerance and benevolence are common\r\ncharacteristics of the institutions of learning in Brazil. The Imperial\r\nMuseum of Natural History in the Capital is antiquated; to any one\r\nacquainted with Museums which are living and progressive, it is evident\r\nthat the collections it contains have been allowed to remain for years\r\nin their present condition, without additions or improvements. The\r\nmounted animals, mammalia and birds, are faded; and the fishes, with the\r\nexception of a few beautifully stuffed specimens from the Amazons, give\r\nno idea of the variety to be found in the Brazilian waters. A better\r\ncollection might be made any morning in the fish-market. The Museum\r\ncontains some very fine fossil remains from the valley of the San\r\nFrancisco and from Ceará, but no attempt has as yet been made to arrange\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe only learned society deserving a special mention is the Historical\r\nand Geographical Institute. Its Transactions are regularly published,\r\nand form already a series of many volumes, full of valuable documents,\r\nchiefly relative to the history of South America. The meetings are held\r\nin the Imperial Palace of Rio, and are habitually presided over by his\r\nMajesty the Emperor.\r\n\r\nI cannot close what I have to say of instruction in Brazil without\r\nadding that, in a country where only half the nation is educated, there\r\ncan be no complete intellectual progress. Where the difference of\r\neducation makes an intelligent sympathy between men and women almost\r\nimpossible, so that their relation is necessarily limited to that of the\r\ndomestic affections, never raised except in some very exceptional cases\r\nto that of cultivated companionship, the development of the people as a\r\nwhole must remain imperfect and partial. I believe, however, that,\r\nespecially in this direction, a rapid reform may be expected. I have\r\nheard so many intelligent Brazilians lament the want of suitable\r\ninstruction for women in their schools, that I think the standard of\r\neducation for girls will steadily be raised. Remembering the antecedents\r\nof the Brazilians, their inherited notions as to what is becoming in the\r\nprivacy and restraint of a woman’s life, we are not justified, however\r\nfalse these ideas may seem to us, in considering the present generation\r\nas responsible for them; they are also too deeply rooted to be changed\r\nin a day.\r\n\r\nOn several occasions I have alluded in terms of praise to the working of\r\nthe institutions of Brazil. Nothing can be more liberal than the\r\nConstitution of the land; every guaranty is therein secured to the\r\nfreest assertion of all the natural rights of man. And yet there are\r\nsome features in the habits of the people, probably the results of an\r\nantiquated social condition, which impede the progress of the nation. It\r\nshould not be forgotten that the white population of Brazil is chiefly\r\ndescended from the Portuguese, and that of all Europe Portugal is the\r\ncountry which at the time of the discovery and settlement of Brazil, had\r\nleast been affected by the growth of our modern civilization. Indeed,\r\nthe great migrations which convulsed Europe in the Middle Ages, and the\r\nReformation, upon which the new social order chiefly rests, have\r\nscarcely affected Portugal; so that Roman ways, Roman architecture, and\r\na degenerate Latin were still flourishing when her Transatlantic\r\ncolonies were founded; and, as in all colonies, the conditions of the\r\nmother country were but slowly modified. No wonder, therefore, that the\r\nolder structures of Rio de Janeiro should recall, in the most surprising\r\nmanner, the architecture of ancient Rome, as disclosed by the\r\nexcavations of Herculaneum and Pompeii, and that the social condition of\r\nBrazil should remind us of the habits of a people among whom women\r\nplayed so subordinate a part. It seems to me that even now the\r\nadministration of the provinces, as in the Roman civilization, is\r\ncalculated to enforce the law, rather than to develop the material\r\nresources of the country. I have been surprised to find young lawyers\r\nalmost invariably at the head of the administration of the provinces,\r\nwhere practical men, conversant with the interests of agriculture,\r\ncommerce, and the mechanical arts, would, in my opinion, have been\r\nbetter adapted to the pressing duty of stimulating all pursuits\r\nconnected with the active life of a young and aspiring nation.\r\n\r\nThe exaggerated appreciation of political employment prevailing\r\neverywhere is a misfortune. It throws into the shade all other\r\noccupations, and loads the government with a crowd of paid officials who\r\nuselessly encumber the public service and are a drain upon the public\r\nfunds. Every man who has received an education seeks a political career,\r\nas at once the most aristocratic and the easiest way of gaining a\r\nlivelihood. It is but recently that gentlemen have begun to engage in\r\nmercantile pursuits.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me, that, though the character and habits of the Brazilians\r\nare not those of an agricultural people, Brazil is an essentially\r\nagricultural country, and some occurrences in her recent history confirm\r\nthis view. Brazil had formerly a great variety of agricultural products,\r\nbut now the number of plants under culture is rather limited.\r\nAgricultural operations are at present centred upon coffee, cotton,\r\nsugar, tobacco, mandioca, some cereals, beans, and cocoa. Owing to her\r\nclimate and her geographical position, the vegetable zones of Brazil are\r\nnot so marked as those of other countries. It would not be difficult to\r\ndivide the whole Empire, with reference to its productions, into three\r\ngreat regions. The first of these, stretching from the borders of Guiana\r\nto Bahia, along the great rivers, is more especially characterized by\r\nthe wild products of the forest: Indian-rubber, cocoa, vanilla,\r\nsarsaparilla, and an infinite variety of gums, resins, barks, and\r\ntextile fibres still unknown to commerce in Europe and the United\r\nStates. To these Brazil might add spices, the monopoly of which belongs\r\nnow to the Sunda Islands. The second region, extending from Bahia to\r\nSanta Catarina, is that of coffee. The third, from Santa Catarina to Rio\r\nGrande, and in the interior of the high plateaux, is that of the grains;\r\nand, in connection with their culture, the raising of cattle. Rice,\r\nwhich is easily grown throughout Brazil, and cotton, which yields\r\nmagnificent crops in all the provinces, bind together these three zones,\r\nsugar and tobacco following in their train. An important step with\r\nreference to agriculture, which has scarcely been thought of as yet, is\r\nthe cultivation of the heights of the Organ Mountains, as well as those\r\nof the Serra do Mar and the Serra do Mantiqueira. On these high lands\r\nmight be raised all the products characteristic of the warmer portions\r\nof the temperate zones, and Rio de Janeiro would receive daily from the\r\nmountains in her immediate neighborhood all those vegetables and garden\r\nfruits which she now procures in small quantities and at high prices\r\nfrom the provinces bordering on the La Plata. The slopes of these Serras\r\nmight also be covered with plantations of cascarilla, and, as the\r\nproduction of quinine must sooner or later be greatly diminished by the\r\ndevastation of the Cinchora-trees on the upper Amazonian tributaries, it\r\nis the more important that their culture should be introduced upon the\r\nlargest scale on the heights above Rio. The attempts of Mr. Glaziou in\r\nthat direction deserve every encouragement.\r\n\r\nThe sugar-cane has long been the chief object of cultivation in Brazil,\r\nand the production of sugar is still considerable; but within several\r\nyears the planting of sugar-cane has given way in many districts to that\r\nof coffee. I have taken pains to ascertain the facts respecting the\r\nculture of coffee during the last fifty years; the immense development\r\nof this branch of industry and the rapidity of the movement, especially\r\nin a country where labor is so scarce, is among the most striking\r\neconomical phenomena of our century. Thanks to their perseverance and to\r\nthe favorable conditions presented by the constitution of their soil,\r\nthe Brazilians have obtained a sort of monopoly of coffee. More than\r\nhalf the coffee consumed in the world is of Brazilian growth. And yet\r\nthe coffee of Brazil has little reputation, and is even greatly\r\nunderrated. Why is this? Simply because a great deal of the best produce\r\nof Brazilian plantations is sold under the name of Java or Mocha, or as\r\nthe coffee of Martinique or Bourbon. Martinique produces only six\r\nhundred sacks of coffee annually; Guadaloupe, whose coffee is sold under\r\nthe name of the neighboring island, yields six thousand sacks, not\r\nenough to provide the market of Rio de Janeiro for twenty-four hours,\r\nand the island of Bourbon hardly more. A great part of the coffee which\r\nis bought under these names, or under that of Java coffee, is Brazilian,\r\nwhile the so-called Mocha coffee is often nothing but the small round\r\nbeans of the Brazilian plant found at the summits of the branches and\r\nvery carefully selected. If the fazendeiros, like the Java planters,\r\nsold their crops under a special mark, the great purchasers would learn\r\nwith what merchandise they have to deal, and the agriculture of Brazil\r\nwould be greatly benefited. But there intervenes between the fazendeiro\r\nand the exporter a class of merchants—half bankers, half brokers—known\r\nas commissarios, who, by mixing different harvests, lower the standard\r\nof the crop, thus relieving the producer of all responsibility and\r\ndepriving the product of its true characteristics.\r\n\r\nIf the provinces adjacent to Rio de Janeiro offer naturally the most\r\nfavorable soil for the culture of coffee, it must not be forgotten that\r\ncoffee is planted with advantage in the shade of the Amazonian forest,\r\nand even yields two annual crops wherever pains are taken to plant it.\r\nIn the province of Ceará, where the coffee is of a superior quality, it\r\nis not planted on the plains, or in the low grounds, or in the shadow of\r\nthe forest, as in the valley of the Amazons, but on the slopes of the\r\nhills and on the mountain heights, to an elevation of from fifteen\r\nhundred to two thousand feet and more above the level of the sea, in the\r\nSerras of Aratanha and Baturité and in the Serra Grande. The channels\r\nopened to these products should augment their importance, and should\r\ngive rise to numerous establishments in the valley of the Amazons.\r\n\r\nThe increased exportation of cotton from Brazil during the last few\r\nyears is a still more marked feature in its industrial history than the\r\nlarge coffee crops. When, towards the close of the last century, cotton\r\nbegan to assume in England an importance which has ever since been\r\nincreasing, Brazil naturally became one of the great providers of the\r\nEnglish market. But it soon lost this advantage, because our Southern\r\nStates acquired, with an extraordinary rapidity, an almost complete\r\nmonopoly of this product. Favored by exceptional circumstances, North\r\nAmerica succeeded, about the year 1846, in furnishing cotton at such low\r\nrates that all competition became impossible, and the culture of cotton\r\nwas almost abandoned in other countries. Brazil, however, persisted. Her\r\nannual production showed a slow but steady progress; even the cessation\r\nof the slave-trade did not interrupt this advance. Indeed, it is a\r\nstriking fact, which may well be mentioned in this connection, that the\r\nstatistics of Brazilian agriculture have been steadily rising ever since\r\nthe abolition of the slave-trade. When the Rebellion broke out in our\r\nSouthern States, Brazil thus found herself prepared to give a\r\nconsiderable impulse to the cultivation of a product as much sought for\r\nas bread in time of famine. Spite of the want of population, which is an\r\nobstacle to all industrial enterprises in Brazil, she found labor, and,\r\nwhat was still more important, free labor, for this object. It seemed as\r\nif it were a point of national honor to show what could be done.\r\nProvinces like San Paolo, where a foot of ground had never before been\r\nplanted with cotton; others, as for instance Alagoas, Parahyba do Norte,\r\nCeará, where the cultivation of cotton had been abandoned, produced\r\nextraordinary quantities,—so large, indeed, that two lines of steamers\r\nwere established, and have prospered, between Liverpool and the\r\nabove-mentioned ports, chiefly for the transport of this crop. It will\r\nbe remembered that during the whole of this time Brazil was in want of\r\nlaborers, that she received no foreign capital for this undertaking,\r\nthat she imported neither Coolies nor Chinese, that almost immediately\r\nafter the movement began her war with Paraguay broke out, and yet her\r\nproduction of cotton has quadrupled and quintupled. This fact assumed\r\nsuch importance in the estimate of industrial interests at the late\r\nParis Exposition, that an exceptional prize was awarded to Brazil, on\r\nthe ground that, in supplying the European market so largely with this\r\nindispensable staple, she had rendered it independent of the former\r\nmonopoly of the United States. It is true that the same prize was also\r\ngranted to Algeria and to Egypt. But the Brazilian planter had not, like\r\nthe colonists of Africa, the stimulus of a large subsidy from\r\ngovernment; he could not, like the Viceroy of Egypt, seize 80,000 men in\r\na single district and transport them to his plantations; neither did he,\r\nlike the Egyptian fellah, abandon all other branches of agriculture in\r\norder to devote himself exclusively to that of cotton. In fact, the\r\ngeneral interests of agriculture prospered in Brazil, in the midst of\r\nthis new enterprise.\r\n\r\nI have insisted on these facts, which I think are little known, because\r\nthey seem to me to show a greater energy and vitality than is usually\r\nsupposed to exist in the productive forces of Brazil. To stimulate this\r\nmovement, the government has recently taken the initiatory steps in the\r\norganization of an Agricultural School in the vicinity of Bahia, in\r\nwhich all the modern improvements suggested by the progress of science\r\nand invention, are to be tested in their application to the natural\r\nproducts of the tropics.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the basin of the Amazons to Brazil, from an industrial\r\npoint of view, can hardly be overestimated. Its woods alone have an\r\nalmost priceless value. Nowhere in the world is there finer timber,\r\neither for solid construction or for works of ornament; and yet it is\r\nscarcely used even for the local buildings, and makes no part whatever\r\nof the exports. It is strange that the development of this branch of\r\nindustry should not even have begun in Brazil, for the rivers which flow\r\npast these magnificent forests seem meant to serve, first as a\r\nwater-power for the saw-mills which ought to be established along their\r\nborders, and then as a means of transportation for the material so\r\nprovided. Setting aside the woods as timber, what shall I say of the\r\nmass of fruits, resins, oils, coloring matters, textile fibres, which\r\nthey yield? When I stopped at Pará, on my way home to the United States,\r\nan exhibition of Amazonian products, brought together in preparation for\r\nthe World’s Fair at Paris, was still open. Much as I had admired, during\r\nmy journey, the richness and variety of the materials native to the\r\nsoil, I was amazed when I saw them thus side by side. There I noticed,\r\namong others, a collection of no less than one hundred and seventeen\r\ndifferent kinds of highly valuable woods, cut from a piece of land less\r\nthan half a mile square. Of these many were dark-colored, veined woods\r\nsusceptible of a high polish,—as beautiful as rosewood or ebony. There\r\nwas a great variety of vegetable oils, all remarkable for their\r\nclearness and purity. There were a number of fabrics made from the\r\nfibres of the palm, and an endless variety of fruits. An empire might\r\nesteem itself rich in any one of the sources of industry which abound in\r\nthis valley, and yet the greater part of its vast growth rots on the\r\nground, and goes to form a little more river-mud or to stain the waters\r\non the shores of which its manifold products die and decompose. But what\r\nsurprised me most was to find that a great part of this region was\r\nfavorable to the raising of cattle. Fine sheep are fed on the grassy\r\nplains and on the hills which stretch between Obydos and Almeyrim, and I\r\nhave rarely eaten better mutton than at Ereré, in the midst of these\r\nserras. And yet the inhabitants of this fertile region suffer from\r\nhunger. The insufficiency of food is evident; but it arises solely from\r\nthe inability of the people to avail themselves of the natural\r\nproductions of the soil. As an instance of this, I may mention that,\r\nthough living on the banks of rivers which abound in delicious fish,\r\nthey make large use of salt cod, imported from other countries!\r\n\r\nWhile travelling upon the Amazons, I have often asked myself what would\r\nbe the best plan for developing the natural resources of that\r\nincomparable region. No doubt the opening of the great river to the\r\ncommerce of all nations was a first step in the right direction; and\r\nthis measure in itself shows what extraordinary progress Brazil is\r\nmaking, for it is hardly more than half a century, since, owing to the\r\nnarrow policy and jealous disposition of the Portuguese government, the\r\ngreatest traveller of modern times was forbidden to enter the valley of\r\nthe Amazons; while to-day a scientific errand of a similar character is\r\nwelcomed and fostered in every possible way by the government of a\r\nnation now independent of Europe. But a free competition is a necessary\r\ncomplement to the freedom already granted, and competition is scarcely\r\npossible where monopolies are kept up. I hold, therefore, that all the\r\nexceptional facilities granted by the Brazilian government to private\r\ncompanies are detrimental to its best interests. There is, however,\r\nanother direct obstacle to progress which ought at once to be removed,\r\nsince the change could in no way injure the general welfare. The present\r\nlimitation of the provinces of Pará and of the Amazons is entirely\r\nunnatural. The whole valley is cut in two transversely, so that its\r\nlower half is of necessity a bar to the independent growth of the upper\r\nhalf. Pará, being made the centre of everything, drains the whole\r\ncountry without vitalizing the interior. The great river which should be\r\nan international highway has become an inland stream. But suppose for a\r\nmoment that the Amazons, like our Mississippi, were made the boundary\r\nbetween a succession of independent provinces on either side of it;\r\nsuppose that on the southern banks of the Amazons the province of Teffé\r\nshould extend from the borders of Peru to the banks of the Madeira, the\r\nprovince of Santarem from the Madeira to the Xingu, and that of Pará be\r\nreduced to the country east of the Xingu, including the Island of\r\nMarajo; each of these separate provinces would then be at once bounded\r\nand traversed by great streams, securing the double activity of\r\ncompetition and the stimulus of internal conveniences. In like manner\r\nshould the lands on the northern banks of the Amazons form several\r\nindependent provinces; that of Monte Alégre, for instance, extending\r\nfrom the Rio Trombetas to the sea; that of Manaos, from the Rio\r\nTrombetas to the Rio Negro; and perhaps that of the Hyapura, enclosing\r\nthe present wilderness between the Rio Negro and the Solimoens. It will,\r\nno doubt, be objected that such a change would involve an administrative\r\nstaff quite disproportionate to the present population; but the\r\ngovernment of such provinces, even with the few inhabitants they might\r\nnumber, if organized upon the plan of the territorial governments of our\r\ninfant States, would only stimulate local energies, and develop local\r\nresources, without interfering in the least with the central government.\r\nMoreover, any one familiar with the working of the present system in the\r\nvalley of the Amazons must be aware that all the cities started during\r\nthe past century along the great river and its tributaries, far from\r\nprogressing, are going to ruin and decay; and this is unquestionably\r\nowing to the centralization at Pará of all the real activity of the\r\nwhole country.\r\n\r\nWithout a much denser population, the best efforts of Brazil to increase\r\nits prosperity must be slow and ineffective. No wonder, then, that,\r\nimmediately after the declaration of independence, Dom Pedro I.\r\nattempted to attract German emigrants to his new empire. From that\r\nperiod dates the Colony of San Leopoldo, near Porto Alégre, on the Rio\r\nGrande do Sul. It was not, however, till the year 1850, when the\r\nslave-trade was actually abolished, and it was no longer possible to\r\nimport labor from Africa, that these colonization schemes assumed a more\r\ndefinite and settled character. In this attempt the planters and the\r\ngovernment were agreed, but with a different object. The plan of the\r\ngovernment, undertaken in perfect good faith, was to create a laboring\r\npopulation, and a class of small landed proprietors. The planters, on\r\nthe contrary, accustomed to compulsory labor, thought only of recruiting\r\ntheir slave ranks by substituting Europeans for Africans. This led to\r\nterrible abuses; under pretence of advancing their passage-money, poor\r\nemigrants, and especially the ignorant Portuguese from the Azores, were\r\nvirtually sold under a contract which they subsequently found it very\r\ndifficult to break. These abuses have thrown discredit upon the attempts\r\nof the Brazilian government to colonize the interior, but the iniquities\r\npractised under the name of emigration are now corrected. In fact, the\r\ncolonies established directly by the government, on public lands, have\r\nnever suffered wrong; on the contrary, the German settlements in Sta\r\nCatherina, on the Rio Grande do Sul and on the San Francisco do Sul are\r\nvery prosperous. The best evidence of the improvement in the condition\r\nof the colonists, and of the more liberal spirit of the nation towards\r\nthem, is the spontaneous formation in Rio de Janeiro of an international\r\nsociety of emigration independent of all government influence,\r\nconsisting of Brazilians, Portuguese, Germans, Swiss, Americans, French,\r\n&c. The objects of this society, of which Mr. Tavares Bastos is one of\r\nthe most influential members, are, first, to reform the constitution in\r\nall which may place the foreigner at a disadvantage; second, to redress\r\nthe wrongs of the emigrants; third, to provide them with such assistance\r\nand information as they may need on arriving. This society has been in\r\nexistence only two years, but has already rendered valuable services. It\r\nis to be hoped that the government will persevere in the liberal course\r\nit has entered upon, and, above all, put an end to the unnecessary legal\r\nformalities by which the emigrant is prevented from taking immediate\r\npossession of his new home. This is especially important in the region\r\nof the Amazons, where the new-comer finds none of those facilities which\r\nwelcome the emigrant in the United States. I cannot too often repeat,\r\nalso, that all monopoly of transport in the Amazons should speedily be\r\nabolished. As soon as the wild products of its shores are subjected to a\r\nregular culture, even of a very imperfect kind, and are no longer\r\ngathered at random,—as soon as organized labor, directed by an\r\nintelligent activity, takes the place of the thoughtless and uncertain\r\nefforts of the Indians, the variety and excellence of its staples will\r\nbe increased beyond all expectation. As it is, a little foresight would\r\nprevent an immense deal of suffering in this fertile region, where food\r\nabounds and people die of hunger. Accustomed to live upon fish, the\r\nnatives make little use either of milk or meat, and the fine pasturage\r\nwhich might maintain herds of cattle is allowed to run to waste.\r\nCareless of the inclemency of the weather when gathering the harvest of\r\nthe forest, they scarcely build a shelter against the heavy rains, allow\r\ntheir wet clothes to dry upon their skin, and expose themselves to\r\nconstant alternations of heat and cold. Add to this, that they do not\r\nhesitate to drink stagnant water, if it be nearer at hand than spring\r\nwater, and we have causes enough for the prevalence of intermittent\r\nfever and malarious diseases, without attributing them to a climate\r\nwhich is in the main salubrious, and far more moderate in temperature\r\nthan is generally supposed. The false notions generally current, even in\r\nBrazil, in regard to the climate of the Amazons might have been removed\r\nlong ago, were the public officers of the northern provinces of the\r\nEmpire not interested in keeping up the delusion. The Amazonian\r\nprovinces are made stepping-stones to higher employments. The young\r\ncandidates who accept these posts claim a reward for the\r\ndisinterestedness they have shown in exposing themselves to disease, and\r\nmake the reputed fatality of the climate an excuse for leaving these\r\nremote stations after a few months’ sojourn. The northern provinces of\r\nBrazil need an administration less liable to change, and based upon\r\npatient study of their local interests, and a faithful adherence to\r\nthem. It is impossible that the president who comes for six months, and\r\nis daily longing for his return to the society and amusements of the\r\nlarger cities, should even initiate, far less complete, any systematic\r\nimprovements. Like every country struggling for recognition among the\r\nself-reliant nations of the world, Brazil has to contend with the\r\nprejudiced reports of a floating foreign population, indifferent to the\r\nwelfare of the land they temporarily inhabit, and whose appreciations\r\nare mainly influenced by private interest. It is much to be regretted\r\nthat the government has not thought it worth while to take decided\r\nmeasures to correct the erroneous impressions current abroad concerning\r\nits administration, and that its diplomatic agents do so little to\r\ncirculate truthful and authoritative statements of their domestic\r\nconcerns. As far as I know, the recent World’s Fair at Paris was the\r\nfirst occasion when an attempt was made to present a comprehensive\r\nreport of the resources of the Empire, and the prizes awarded to the\r\nBrazilians testify to their success.\r\n\r\nImperfect as is this sketch, I trust I have been able to show, what I\r\ndeeply feel, that there are elements of a high progress in Brazil, that\r\nit has institutions which are shaping the country to worthy ends, that\r\nit has a nationality already active, showing its power at the present\r\nmoment in carrying on one of the most important wars ever undertaken in\r\nSouth America. Neither is this struggle maintained by Brazil for selfish\r\nends; in her conflict with Paraguay she may truly be counted among the\r\nstandard-bearers of civilization. The facts which have come to my\r\nknowledge respecting this war have convinced me that it originated in\r\nhonorable purposes, and, setting aside the selfish intrigues of\r\nindividuals, inevitably connected with such movements, is carried on\r\nwith disinterestedness. It deserves the sympathy of the civilized world,\r\nfor it strikes at a tyrannical organization, half clerical, half\r\nmilitary, which, calling itself a republic, disgraces the name it\r\nassumes.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWill my Brazilian friends who read this summary say that I have given\r\nbut grudging praise to their public institutions, accompanied by an\r\nunkind criticism of their social condition? I hope not. I should do\r\nmyself great wrong did I give the impression that I part from Brazil\r\nwith any feeling but that of warm sympathy, a deep-rooted belief in her\r\nfuture progress and prosperity, and sincere personal gratitude toward\r\nher. I recognize in the Brazilians as a nation their susceptibility to\r\nlofty impulses and emotions, their love of theoretical liberty, their\r\nnatural generosity, their aptness to learn, their ready eloquence; if\r\nalso I miss among them something of the stronger and more persistent\r\nqualities of the Northern races, I do but recall a distinction which is\r\nas ancient as the tropical and temperate zones themselves.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 107:\r\n\r\n  I deeply regret that I could not visit the mining districts of Brazil.\r\n  Especially would I have liked to examine for myself the Cascalho, in\r\n  which the diamonds are found. From collections which I owe to the\r\n  kindness of Dr. Vieira de Mattos in Rio de Janeiro, and Senhor Antonio\r\n  de Lacerda in Bahia, I am prepared to find that the whole\r\n  diamond-bearing formation is glacial drift. I do not mean the rocks in\r\n  which the diamonds occur in their primary position, but the secondary\r\n  agglomerations of loose materials from which they are washed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               APPENDIX.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          I.—THE GULF STREAM.\r\n\r\nAs the results of the systematic investigation of the Gulf Stream upon a\r\nplan laid out by Dr. A. D. Bache, and executed, under his direction, by\r\nhis most able assistants, have hardly yet been presented in a popular\r\nform, a sketch of the whole may not be out of place here. This\r\ninvestigation embraced not only surface-phenomena, but the whole\r\ninternal structure and movement of this wonderful current. It is well\r\nknown that the Gulf Stream has its origin in the equatorial current\r\nwhich, starting from the Gulf of Guinea, flows for a time in a westerly\r\ndirection, till it approaches Cape St. Roque. This great projection of\r\nthe eastern coast of South America interrupts its onward progress, and\r\ncauses it to divide into two branches, one of which follows the coast of\r\nBrazil, in a southerly direction, while the other continues its course\r\nto the northwest, until it reaches the Caribbean Sea. After pouring into\r\nthat basin, the great stream turns to the east to enter the Atlantic\r\nagain off Cape Florida. The high temperature of the equatorial current\r\nis owing to its origin in the tropical zone, its westward course being\r\ndetermined by the rotation of the earth and by the trade-winds. On\r\nissuing from the Gulf of Mexico the stream is encased between the island\r\nof Cuba and the Bahamas on one side and the coast of Florida on the\r\nother. Here it meets the Atlantic in a latitude where the ocean-waters\r\nhave no longer the high temperature of the tropics, whereas the stream\r\nitself has acquired an increased warmth on the shoals of the Gulf. This\r\naccounts for the great difference of temperature between the waters of\r\nthe stream and those of the ocean to the east of it; while the still\r\ngreater cold of the sea-water on its western side, between the Gulf\r\nStream and the continental shore, is explained by the great Arctic\r\ncurrent, pouring down from Baffin’s Bay, and skirting the shore of North\r\nAmerica as far as the Coast of Florida, until it is lost in that\r\nlatitude under the Gulf Stream. The object of Dr. Bache’s investigation\r\nwas to trace the mutual relations of these two great currents of warm\r\nand cold water, flowing side by side in opposite directions, and to\r\ndiscover the conditions which regulate their movements and keep them\r\nwithin definite limits.\r\n\r\nThe investigation is even now by no means complete, though it has been\r\ngoing on for many years. It has, however, been ascertained that, while\r\nthe ocean-bed deepens more or less rapidly as we recede from the shore,\r\nforming a trough in which the Gulf Stream flows, this trough is limited\r\non its eastern side by a range of hills trending in the direction of the\r\ncurrent, outside of which is another depression or valley. Indeed, the\r\nsea-bottom exhibits parallel ridges and depressions, running like the\r\nshore of the continent itself, in a northeasterly direction. The water\r\npresents differences of temperature, not only on the surface, but at\r\nvarious depths below. These inequalities have been determined by a\r\nsuccession of thermometric observations along several lines, crossing\r\nthe Gulf Stream from the shore to the ocean water on its eastern side,\r\nat intervals of about a hundred miles. The observations have been made\r\nfirst at the surface, and then at successively greater depths, varying\r\nfrom ten to twenty, thirty, one hundred, two hundred, and even three and\r\nfour hundred fathoms. This survey has shown that, while the Gulf Stream\r\nhas a temperature higher than that of the waters on either side, it is\r\nalso alternately warmer and colder within itself, being made up as it\r\nwere of distinct streaks of water of different temperature. These\r\nalternations continue to as great a depth as the observations have been\r\ncarried, and are found to extend even to the very bottom of the sea,\r\nwhere this has been reached. The most surprising part of this result is\r\nthe abruptness of the change along the line where the two great currents\r\ntouch each other. So sharp is this division that the boundary of the\r\nArctic current is now technically designated as the “Cold wall” of the\r\nGulf Stream. Of course as the latter flows northward and eastward it\r\ngradually widens, and its temperature is lowered; but even as far north\r\nas Sandy Hook the difference between its temperature at the surface and\r\nthat of the surrounding waters is still marked.\r\n\r\nOff Cape Florida the width of the Gulf Stream is not over forty miles;\r\noff Charleston it is one hundred and fifty miles; while at Sandy Hook it\r\nexceeds three hundred miles.\r\n\r\nThe inequality of the bottom may be appreciated by the soundings off\r\nCharleston, where, from the shore to a distance of two hundred miles,\r\nthe following depth was successively measured: 10, 25, 100, 250, 300,\r\n600, 350, 550, 450, 475, 450, and 400 fathoms.\r\n\r\nThe following table may give some idea of the temperature of the stream\r\nin connection with its depth:—\r\n\r\n Off Sandy Hook, at successive distances from the coast, of\r\n\r\n    100,    150,    200,    250,    300,    350,     and     400 miles,\r\n\r\n the temperature near the surface to a depth of thirty fathoms averages:\r\n\r\n            65°,    66°,    64°,    81°,    80°,     and     75° Fahr.;\r\n\r\n at a depth of between forty and a hundred fathoms it averages:\r\n\r\n    50°,    52°,    50°,    47°,    72°,    68°,     and     65° Fahr.;\r\n\r\n at a depth below three hundred fathoms it averages:\r\n\r\n    37°,    39°,    40°,    37°,    55°,    57°,     and     55° Fahr.\r\n\r\nThe rapid rise of the temperature after the fourth column of figures\r\nindicates the position of the Cold wall.\r\n\r\nFor further details see the United States Coast Survey Report for 1860,\r\npage 165, and the accompanying maps,—which should be copied into all our\r\nschool atlases.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           II.—FLYING-FISHES.\r\n\r\nThe motions of animals vary greatly with reference to the medium in\r\nwhich they live. Our present knowledge renders it, however, necessary\r\nthat we should weigh these differences with reference to the structural\r\ncharacter of the organs of locomotion themselves, as well as to that of\r\nthe peculiar resistance of the element in which they move. When we speak\r\nof the flight of Birds, of Insects, of Fishes, of Bats, &c., and\r\ndesignate their locomotive organs indiscriminately as wings, it is\r\nevident that the character of the motion and not the special structure\r\nof the organs has determined our nomenclature. We are influenced by the\r\nsame consideration when we give the name of fins to the organs of all\r\nanimals which swim in the water, be they Whales, Turtles, Fishes,\r\nCrustacea, or Mollusks. It requires but a superficial acquaintance with\r\nthe anatomy of the flying-fishes to perceive that their organs of flight\r\nare built upon exactly the same pattern as the pectoral fins of most\r\nfishes, and differ entirely from the wing of birds, as also from the\r\nwing of bats, the latter being in all essentials a paw, identical with\r\nthe paw of ordinary quadrupeds, save the length of the fingers and the\r\nabsence of nails on the longest of them. No wonder, then, that the\r\nflight of the flying-fishes should entirely differ from that of birds or\r\nbats.\r\n\r\nI have had frequent occasions to observe the flying-fishes attentively.\r\nI am confident not only that they change the direction of their flight,\r\nbut that they raise or lower their line of movement repeatedly, without\r\nreturning to the water. I avoid the word falling designedly, for all the\r\nacts of these fishes during their flight seem to me completely\r\nvoluntary. They raise themselves from the surface of the water by\r\nrapidly repeated blows with the tail, and more than once have I seen\r\nthem descend again to the surface of the water in order to repeat this\r\nmovement; thus renewing the impulse and enabling themselves to continue\r\nfor a longer time their passage through the air. Their changes of\r\ndirection, either to the right and left or in rising and descending, are\r\nnot due to the beating of the wings, that is to say, of the great\r\npectoral fins, but simply to an inflexion of the whole surface, in one\r\nor the other direction, by the contraction of the muscles controlling\r\nthe action of the fin-rays, their pressure against the air determining\r\nthe movement. The flying-fish is in fact a living shuttlecock, capable\r\nof directing its own course by the bending of its large fins. It\r\nprobably maintains itself in the air until the necessity of breathing\r\ncompels it to return to the water. The motive of its flight seems to me\r\nto be fear; for it is always in the immediate neighborhood and in front\r\nof the vessel that they are seen to rise; or perhaps at a distance when\r\nthey are pursued by some large fish. Now that I have studied their\r\nmovements, I am better able to appreciate the peculiarities of their\r\nstructure, especially the inequality of the caudal fin. It is perfectly\r\nclear that the greater length of the lower lobe of the caudal is\r\nintended to facilitate the movements by which the whole body is thrown\r\nout of water and carried through the air; while the amplitude of the\r\npectoral fins affords only a support during the passage through the\r\nlighter medium. Nothing shows more plainly the freedom of their\r\nmovements than the fact that, when the surface of the sea is swelling\r\ninto billows, the flying-fishes may hug its inequalities very closely\r\nand do not move in a regular curve, first ascending from and then\r\ndescending again to the level of the water. Nor do they appear to fall\r\ninto their natural element, as if the power that had impelled them was\r\nexhausted; they seem rather to dive voluntarily into the water,\r\nsometimes after a very short and sometimes after a rather protracted\r\nflight, during which they may change their direction, as well as the\r\nheight at which they move.\r\n\r\nThe most common flying-fishes of the Atlantic belong to the genus\r\nExocetus, and are closely allied to our Billfish (Belone). J. Müller has\r\nshown that they differ greatly from the Herrings, with which they were\r\nformerly associated, and should form a distinct family, to which he has\r\ngiven the name of Scomberesoces. The other flying-fishes belong to the\r\nfamily of the Cottoids, of which our common Sculpins are the chief\r\nrepresentatives.\r\n\r\n\r\n             III.—RESOLUTIONS PASSED ON BOARD THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That the cordial thanks of this meeting are due to Professor\r\nAgassiz for the highly interesting and instructive lectures which he has\r\ndelivered daily during our voyage, and which, though intended more\r\nimmediately to prepare his party for their proposed expedition, have\r\nfurnished to all of us a rich repast.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That the Professor and his companions will carry with them\r\nto their beneficent work the earnest prayers and good wishes of all with\r\nwhom they have been associated on board this ship, that health and\r\nabundant success may be vouchsafed to them.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That in this mission of science from one country convulsed\r\nby war to another not entirely at peace, we behold the humanizing and\r\npacific influence of its aims and studies, and that we cannot but look\r\nforward to a day when nations engaged in the common pursuits of science\r\nand industry, and bound together by commerce and by enlightened views of\r\ninterest and of Christian duty, will refer all questions in dispute to\r\npeaceful arbitrament rather than to one of violence and bloodshed.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That in the facilities afforded by the government of the\r\nUnited States to this scientific expedition, in the munificent\r\ncontribution of a single citizen of Boston towards its expenses, and in\r\nthe generous manner in which the owners of this ship have placed its\r\nunsurpassed comforts and luxuries at the free use of Professor Agassiz\r\nand his party, this meeting beholds a pledge of the profound and growing\r\ninterest of our entire people in the advancement of liberal and useful\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That we cannot approach the capital of Brazil for the\r\npurpose of leaving this party, without expressing our admiration for the\r\npersonal and political character of him who presides over this vast\r\nEmpire, and who may well be held forth to all rulers as a model of\r\nintelligence, of virtue, and devotion to the public weal.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That we cannot close this part of our voyage without\r\ntendering to Captain Bradbury, and his subordinate officers, our special\r\nthanks, not only for the masterly manner with which their vessel is\r\nhandled, but for their unwearied devotion to the comfort of their\r\nguests.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    IV.—DOM PEDRO SEGUNDO RAILROAD.\r\n\r\nThe part taken by American engineers in this great undertaking induces\r\nme to give here a short account of its history.\r\n\r\nThe decree conceding to one or more companies the entire or partial\r\nconstruction of a railway which, commencing in the municipality of Rio\r\nde Janeiro, should terminate in such points in the Provinces of Minas\r\nand St. Paulo as should be most advantageous, was promulgated in 1852. A\r\ncompany was organized with a capital of thirty-eight thousand Contos of\r\nreis, or nineteen millions of dollars; the general plan being to\r\nconstruct a trunk line from the city of Rio de Janeiro to the River\r\nParahyba, a distance of about 67 miles from the coast. A contract was\r\nmade with an English engineer, Mr. Edward Price, for the building of the\r\nfirst section of this road, extending a distance of 38½ miles, from Rio\r\nde Janeiro to Belem. For the construction of the second section, which\r\nembraced the mountain barrier separating the valley of Parahyba from the\r\nsea-coast, and in which the greatest difficulties were therefore to be\r\nencountered, it was proposed by Senhor Christiano B. Ottoni, President\r\nof the road, to employ American engineers, and if possible to engage the\r\nservices of men who had actually constructed railways across mountain\r\nranges in the United States. To this effect, Colonel C. F. M. Garnett\r\nwas engaged as chief engineer, and came to Brazil in 1856, accompanied\r\nby Major A. Ellison, as his principal assistant. Colonel Garnett\r\nremained in the country somewhat more than two years, during which time\r\nthe portion of the road known as the second section, and extending from\r\nBelem to Parahyba, was laid out and its construction commenced, surveys\r\nbeing also made of the branches up and down the river, constituting the\r\nthird and fourth sections. On Colonel Garnett’s departure, Major Ellison\r\nremained as chief engineer, having his brother, Mr. Wm. S. Ellison,\r\nassociated with him in the direction of the road. In July, 1865, at\r\nwhich time the road was actually completed as far as Barro de Pirahy,\r\nthe company being unable to raise funds for the continuation of the\r\nwork, it was assumed by the government, as a national undertaking, and\r\nMajor Ellison, resigning his position, was succeeded by Mr. Wm. S.\r\nEllison as chief engineer.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties of construction throughout the second section were\r\nimmense; indeed, there was an almost universal distrust of the\r\npracticability of the work. Even after it was considerably advanced, it\r\nwould probably have been abandoned but for the energy of the President,\r\nwho shared the confidence of the engineers, and pushed forward the\r\nenterprise almost single-handed, in spite of the incredulity of its\r\nfriends and the objections of its opponents. The sharpness of the\r\nmountain spurs rendering it impossible in many cases to pass around\r\nthem, tunnels became necessary, and fifteen were actually made, varying\r\nfrom 300 to more than 7,300 feet in length, forming, in the aggregate,\r\nthree miles of subterraneous line. Of those tunnels, three pass through\r\nrock decomposed to such a degree that lining throughout was necessary,\r\nwhile the rest are pierced, for the greater part, through solid rock,\r\nthough requiring the same precaution occasionally. The total length of\r\nlining with masonry is 5,700 feet. In the course of this operation\r\nconstant danger and difficulty arose from the breaking in of the rock,\r\nand in one instance the whole mountain spur through which the tunnel had\r\nbeen driven parted from the main mass and, sliding down, obliterated the\r\nwork, so that it was necessary to begin the perforation again,\r\ncontending continually against the enormous pressure of the loose\r\nsuperincumbent _débris_. Were this the fitting place, it would be\r\ninteresting to give the history of this enterprise more in detail;\r\nespecially that of the work connected with building the great tunnel and\r\nthe temporary track which was in use when I first passed over the road.\r\nSuffice it to say, that all that portion of the road which is included\r\nwithin the second section is a triumph of engineering, which excites the\r\nadmiration of the most competent judges, and is in the highest degree\r\ncreditable to those under whose direction it has been accomplished.\r\n\r\n\r\n      V.—PERMANENCE OF CHARACTERISTICS IN DIFFERENT HUMAN SPECIES.\r\n\r\nAs my special object of study in the Amazons had reference to the\r\ncharacter and distribution of the fluviatile faunæ, I could not\r\nundertake those more accurate investigations of the human races, based\r\nupon minute measurements repeated a thousand-fold, which characterize\r\nthe latest researches of anthropologists. A thorough study of the\r\ndifferent nations and cross-breeds inhabiting the Amazonian Valley would\r\nrequire years of observation and patient examination. I was forced to be\r\nsatisfied with such data as I could gather aside from my other labors,\r\nand to limit myself in my study of the races to what I would call the\r\nnatural history method; viz. the comparison of individuals of different\r\nkinds with one another, just as naturalists compare specimens of\r\ndifferent species. This was less difficult in a hot country, where the\r\nuncultivated part of the population go half naked, and are frequently\r\nseen entirely undressed. During a protracted residence in Manaos, Mr.\r\nHunnewell made a great many characteristic photographs of Indians and\r\nNegroes, and half-breeds between both these races and the Whites. All\r\nthese portraits represent the individuals selected in three normal\r\npositions, in full face, in perfect profile, and from behind. I hope\r\nsooner or later to have an opportunity of publishing these\r\nillustrations, as well as those of pure negroes made for me in Rio by\r\nMessrs. Stahl and Wahnschaffe.\r\n\r\nWhat struck me at first view, in seeing Indians and Negroes together,\r\nwas the marked difference in the relative proportions of the different\r\nparts of the body. Like long-armed monkeys the Negroes are generally\r\nslender, with long legs, long arms, and a comparatively short body,\r\nwhile the Indians are short-legged, short-armed, and long-bodied, the\r\ntrunk being also rather heavy in build. To continue the comparison, I\r\nmay say that if the Negro by his bearing recalls the slender, active\r\nHylobates, the Indian is more like the slow, inactive, stout Orang. Of\r\ncourse there are exceptions to this rule; short, thick-built Negroes are\r\noccasionally to be seen, as well as tall, lean Indians; but, so far as\r\nmy observation goes, the essential difference between the Indian and\r\nNegro races, taken as a whole, consists in the length and square build\r\nof the trunk and the shortness of limbs in the Indian as compared with\r\nthe lean frame, short trunk, deep-cleft legs, and long arms of the\r\nNegro.\r\n\r\nAnother feature not less striking, though it does not affect the whole\r\nfigure so much, is the short neck and great width of the shoulders in\r\nthe Indian. This peculiarity is quite as marked in the female as in the\r\nmale, so that, when seen from behind, the Indian woman has a very\r\nmasculine air, extending indeed more or less to her whole bearing; for\r\neven her features have rarely the feminine delicacy of higher womanhood.\r\nIn the Negro, on the contrary, the narrowness of chest and shoulder\r\ncharacteristic of woman is almost as marked in the man; indeed, it may\r\nwell be said, that, while the Indian female is remarkable for her\r\nmasculine build, the Negro male is equally so for his feminine aspect.\r\nNevertheless, the difference between the sexes in the two races is not\r\nequally marked. The female Indian resembles in every respect much more\r\nthe male than is the case with the Negroes; the females among the latter\r\nhaving generally more delicate features than the males.\r\n\r\nOn following out the details concomitant with these general differences,\r\nwe find that they agree most strikingly. In a front view of an Indian\r\nwoman and a Negress the great difference is in the width between the\r\nbreasts of the former as compared with their close approximation in the\r\nlatter. In the Indian the interval between the two breasts is nearly\r\nequal to the diameter of one of them; while in the Negro they stand in\r\nalmost immediate contact. But this is not all; the form of the breast\r\nitself is very different in the two. The Indian woman has a conical\r\nbreast, firm and well supported, the point being turned so far sideways\r\nthat the breast seems to arise under the arm-pit, the nipple being\r\nactually projected on the arm in a full-faced view of the chest. In the\r\nnegress the breast is more cylindrical, looser, and more flaccid, the\r\nnipple being turned forward and downward, so that in a front view it is\r\nprojected on the chest. In the Indian the inguinal region is broad and\r\ndistinctly set off from the prominence of the abdomen, while in the\r\nNegro it is a mere fold. As to the limbs, they are not only much longer\r\nin proportion in the Negro than the Indian; their form and carriage\r\ndiffers also. The legs of the Indians are remarkably straight, in the\r\nNegro the knees are bent in, and the hip as well as knee-joint\r\nhabitually flexed. Similar differences in other parts of the body are\r\nvisible from behind; in the Indians the interval between the two\r\nshoulders, the shoulder-blades being comparatively short in themselves,\r\nis much greater than in any other race. In this respect the women do not\r\ndiffer from the men, but share in a feature characteristic of the whole\r\nrace. This peculiarity is especially noticeable in a profile view of the\r\nfigure, in which the broad rounded shoulder marks the outline in the\r\nupper part of the trunk and tapers gradually to a well-shaped arm,\r\nterminating usually in a rather small hand; the little finger is\r\nremarkably short. In the Negro, on the contrary, the shoulder-blades are\r\nlong and placed more closely together, the shoulder being rather slim\r\nand narrow, and the hand disproportionately slender, though the fingers\r\nare more extensively webbed than in any other race. In this respect\r\nthere is little difference between male and female, the build of the\r\nmale being more muscular, but hardly stouter; in both, a profile view\r\nshows the back and breast projected forwards and backwards of the arm.\r\nThe proportions between the length and width of the trunk, as compared\r\nwith each other, and, measured from the shoulder to the base of the\r\ntrunk, hardly differ in the Indian and Negro; this renders the\r\ndifference in the relative length and strength of the arms and legs the\r\nmore apparent.\r\n\r\nI need not allude to the difference of the hair; everybody knows the\r\nheavy, straight black hair of the Indian, and the wrinkled, woolly hair\r\nof the Negro. Nor is it necessary for me to recall the characteristic\r\nfeatures of the Whites in order to contrast them with what has been said\r\nabove of the Indians and Negroes.\r\n\r\nOnly a few words more concerning half-breeds are needed to show how\r\ndeeply seated are the primary differences between the pure races. Like\r\ndistinct species among animals, different races of men, when crossing,\r\nbring forth half-breeds; and the half-breeds between these different\r\nraces differ greatly. The hybrid between White and Negro, called\r\nMulatto, is too well known to require further description. His features\r\nare handsome, his complexion clear, and his character confiding, but\r\nindolent. The hybrid between the Indian and Negro, known under the name\r\nof Cafuzo, is quite different. His features have nothing of the delicacy\r\nof the Mulatto; his complexion is dark; his hair long, wiry, and curly;\r\nand his character exhibits a happy combination between the jolly\r\ndisposition of the Negro and the energetic, enduring powers of the\r\nIndian. The hybrid between White and Indian, called Mammeluco in Brazil,\r\nis pallid, effeminate, feeble, lazy, and rather obstinate; though it\r\nseems as if the Indian influence had only gone so far as to obliterate\r\nthe higher characteristics of the White, without imparting its own\r\nenergies to the offspring. It is very remarkable how, in both\r\ncombinations, with Negroes as well as Whites, the Indian impresses his\r\nmark more deeply upon his progeny than the other races, and how readily,\r\nalso, in further crossings, the pure Indian characteristics are\r\nreclaimed and those of the other races thrown off. I have known the\r\noffspring of an hybrid between Indian and Negro with an hybrid between\r\nIndian and White resume almost completely the characteristics of the\r\npure Indian.\r\n\r\n\r\n VI.—SKETCH OF SEPARATE JOURNEYS UNDERTAKEN BY DIFFERENT MEMBERS OF THE\r\n                              EXPEDITION.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible for me to give here at length the narrative of the\r\nseparate journeys undertaken by my young companions. To do them any\r\njustice, their reports should be illustrated by the accompanying maps,\r\ngeological sections, &c., which are more appropriate in a special\r\nscientific account. I trust that I shall hereafter find resources for\r\npublishing all these materials in a fitting manner; but, in the mean\r\nwhile, I should do a wrong to my own feelings as well as to my\r\nassistants, did I not add to this volume such a sketch of their separate\r\nwork as will show with how much energy, perseverance, and intelligence\r\nthey carried out the instructions I had given them. It will be\r\nremembered by the reader that one object was kept constantly in view\r\nthroughout this expedition,—namely, that of ascertaining how the\r\nfresh-water fishes are distributed throughout the great river-systems of\r\nBrazil. All the independent journeys, of which short sketches are given\r\nin this summary, were laid out with reference to this idea; the whole\r\nexpedition being, in fact, a unit so far as its purpose and general plan\r\nwere concerned. In this sense my own exploration, and those of all my\r\nassistants, belong together, as parts of one connected scheme.\r\n\r\nThat detachment of the party which was conducted by Mr. Orestes St. John\r\nleft Rio de Janeiro on the 9th of June, 1865. This company consisted of\r\nMessrs. St. John, Allen, Ward, and Sceva. The first two were to reach\r\nthe Atlantic coast by way of the Rio San Francisco and the Rio\r\nParanahyba; while Mr. Ward was to descend the Tocantins to the Amazons,\r\nand Mr. Sceva to remain for some time in the fossiliferous region about\r\nLagoa Sancta for the purpose of collecting. As far as Juiz de Fora they\r\nfollowed the road described in the foregoing narrative. Thence they\r\ncrossed the Serra do Mantiqueira to Barbacena, and kept on from that\r\nplace through Lagoa Dourada and Prados across the Rio Carandahy to the\r\ndivide separating the head-waters of the Rio Grande on the south from\r\nthose of the Rio Paraopeba on the north. They crossed the Paraopeba just\r\nabove the water gap of the Serras of Piedade and Itatiaiassu, traversing\r\nthe former Serra into the mountain valley in which the village of Morro\r\nVelho is situated. They thus found themselves successively in the basins\r\nof the Rio Parahyba, the Rio La Plata, and the Rio San Francisco; all\r\nthese great streams being fed by rivulets which arise in this vicinity.\r\nOn leaving the mountainous districts they continued their route through\r\nalternate campos and wooded tracts to Gequitibá, passing through Saburá,\r\nSanta Luzia, Lagoa Sancta, and Sette Lagoas.\r\n\r\nAt Lagoa Sancta, as had been previously agreed, Mr. Sceva left the\r\nparty, with the purpose of exploring the caves of that region in search\r\nof fossil bones, and making skeletons of mammalia. He remained for some\r\ntime in this neighborhood, and brought away a number of specimens,\r\nthough he did not succeed in finding many fossils, the caves having been\r\nalready despoiled of their fossil remains by Dr. Lund, whose\r\nindefatigable researches in this direction are so well known. Mr. Sceva,\r\nhowever, made very valuable collections of other kinds, and I am\r\nindebted to him for numerous carefully prepared specimens of Brazilian\r\nmammalia, which now await mounting in the Museum. On leaving Lagoa\r\nSancta, Mr. Sceva returned to Rio de Janeiro, taking his collections\r\nwith him. He passed some days there, in order to repack and put in\r\nsafety his own specimens as well as those which had been sent back to\r\nRio by other members of the party. He then proceeded to Canta-Gallo, and\r\npassed the remainder of the time in collecting and preparing specimens\r\nfrom that part of the country, until he joined me subsequently at Rio\r\njust before we returned to the United States. His contributions to our\r\nstores were exceedingly valuable, both on account of the localities from\r\nwhich they came and from the care with which they were put up.\r\n\r\nMr. Ward had already separated from his fellow-travellers at Barbacena,\r\non his way to the Tocantins, taking the route by Ouro-Preto and\r\nDiamantina. And in order to keep together the adventures of the little\r\nband who left Rio in company, I may give here a short sketch of his\r\njourney, before completing the account of the route pursued by Messrs.\r\nSt. John and Allen. After leaving the valley of the Rio Parahyba and\r\ncrossing the Mantiqueira the party found itself in the water-basin of\r\nthe Rio Grande, one of the principal tributaries of the Rio Parana,\r\nwhich, emptying into the Rio La Plata, reaches the ocean below Buenos\r\nAyres. Eastward of this basin, on the ocean-side of the great ridge\r\nwhich bounds the valley of the Rio San Francisco, arise several large\r\nrivers,—the Rio Doce, the Rio Mucury, and the Rio Jequitinhonha. It was\r\none of my most earnest desires to secure the means of comparing their\r\ninhabitants with each other and with those of the great rivers flowing\r\nnorth and east. As will be seen hereafter, Mr. Hartt, with the\r\nassistance of Mr. Copeland, had undertaken to explore the lower course\r\nof these rivers; but it was equally important that specimens should be\r\nobtained from their head-waters. While, therefore, Mr. St. John and his\r\ncompanion pursued their way across the region drained by the head-waters\r\nof the Rio San Francisco, Mr. Ward crossed the mountains, passing from\r\none river-basin into another, in order to examine as many of the\r\ntributaries of the Rio Doce and the Rio Jequitinhonha as possible. To\r\nhim I owe the materials necessary for a general comparison of the river\r\nfaunæ in these different basins. His journey was a laborious and a\r\nlonely one. Separating from his companions at Barbacena he kept on by\r\nOuro-Preto and Santa Barbara into the basin of the Rio Doce, which he\r\nfollowed nearly to the point where the Rio Antonio empties into it. This\r\npart of the journey gave him an opportunity of making a collection not\r\nonly in the head-waters of the Rio Doce, but in one of its principal\r\ntributaries also. Thence crossing the Serra das Esmeraldas Mr. Ward\r\nentered the water-basin of the Rio Jequitinhonha, commonly called Rio\r\nBelmonte on the maps, and after passing Diamantina explored several arms\r\nof this great stream. The collections he made in this region are of\r\nspecial interest with reference to those gathered by Messrs. Hartt and\r\nCopeland on the lower course of the same rivers, and in many other\r\nstreams along the Atlantic coast between Bahia and Rio de Janeiro.\r\nHaving accomplished this part of his journey, Mr. Ward crossed the San\r\nFrancisco at Januaria, making a number of excursions in that vicinity;\r\nthen passing in a northwesterly direction over the ridges which separate\r\nthe valley of the San Francisco from that of the Tocantins, he followed\r\nthe whole course of this great stream to the Amazons. It was a daring\r\nand adventurous journey to be accomplished with no other companionship\r\nthan that of the camarado who served him as guide, or the Indian boatmen\r\nwho rowed his canoe, and it was a day of rejoicing for our whole party\r\nwhen we heard, in the month of January, 1866, of his safe arrival in\r\nPará, whence he embarked a few weeks later for the United States.\r\n\r\nFrom Lagoa Sancta, where they parted from Mr. Sceva, Messrs. St. John\r\nand Allen kept on to Januaria together, but at this point Mr. Allen,\r\nwhose health had been failing from the time he left Rio de Janeiro,\r\nfound himself unable to prosecute the journey farther, and he resolved\r\nto strike across the country to Bahia, taking in charge the collections\r\nthey had brought together thus far. After a short rest at Januaria, he\r\nmade his way to Chique-Chique on the Rio San Francisco; and his separate\r\njournal begins from the time he left this point, on his journey to\r\nBahia. It gives a very full account of the physical features of the\r\nregion through which he passed, of the geographical character of the\r\nsoil, and of the distribution of plants and animals, including many\r\noriginal observations concerning the habits of birds, with a detailed\r\nitinerary of the route through Jacobina, Espelto, and Caxoeira.\r\nProstrated by illness as he was, he has nevertheless furnished a report\r\nthe character of which shows how completely his interest in the work\r\novercame the lassitude of disease.\r\n\r\nFrom Januaria Mr. St. John followed the San Francisco to the Villa do\r\nBarra, where he made a short stay, and then resumed his journey by land\r\nthrough the valley of the Rio Grande to the Villa da Santa Rita, thence\r\nto Mocambo and across the table-land separating the basin of the Rio San\r\nFrancisco from that of the Rio Paranahyba. At Paranaguá he remained\r\nseveral days, and made a considerable collection from this vicinity.\r\nThence he followed the valley of the Rio Gurugueia to Manga, one hundred\r\nand twenty leagues from Paranaguá. At Manga he embarked on one of the\r\nsingular river-boats made of the leafstalks of the Buriti palm, and\r\ndescended the Paranahyba to the villa of San Gonçallo. Here he stayed\r\nfor some time to collect, and forwarded from this vicinity a\r\nconsiderable number of specimens, chiefly reptiles, birds, and insects.\r\nHis next station was at Therezina, the capital of the province of\r\nPiauhy, where he made one of the most interesting collections of the\r\nwhole journey from the waters of the Rio Poty. The Poty is a tributary\r\nof the Paranahyba, into which it empties below Therezina. In examining\r\nthis collection, I was particularly struck with the general similarity\r\nof the fishes contained in it to those of the Amazons. They exhibit\r\nthroughout the same kind of combination of genera and families, although\r\nthe species are entirely distinct. Thus, from a zoölogical point of\r\nview, the basin of the Parahyba, though completely separated from it by\r\nthe ocean, would seem to belong to the Amazonian basin, as it\r\nunquestionably does from a geological point of view. The character of\r\nthe drift deposits along the Rio Gurugueia and the Rio Paranahyba shows\r\nthis area to have been continuous with the basin in which the Amazonian\r\ndrift was deposited; and the similarity of their zoölogical features is\r\nbut another evidence, from an entirely different source, of the\r\nextensive denudations which have isolated these regions from one another\r\nby removing the tracts which formerly made them a unit.\r\n\r\nFrom Therezina Mr. St. John proceeded to Caxias, and finally arrived in\r\nMaranham, by the way of the Rio Itapicurú, on the 8th January, 1866;\r\nhaving completed a journey of more than seven hundred leagues in seven\r\nmonths, over a route the greater part of which had never been examined\r\nfrom a zoölogical or geological point of view. His collections, though\r\nnecessarily limited by the difficulty of transport and the insufficient\r\nprovision of alcohol, were very valuable, and arrived at their\r\ndestination in good condition. Of his geological observations I have\r\nsaid little; but it is from him I have obtained the data which have\r\nenabled me to compare the basin of Piauhy with that of the Amazons. He\r\nmade careful geological surveys wherever he was able to do so, and has\r\nrecorded the result of his observations in a manner which shows that he\r\nnever lost sight of the general relations between the great structural\r\nfeatures of the country through which he passed. At Maranham, the\r\nintermittent fever, under which Mr. St. John had been suffering during\r\nthe latter part of his journey, culminated in a severe illness, from\r\nwhich he recovered under the care of Dr. Braga, who took him into his\r\nown house, and did not allow him to leave his roof until he was restored\r\nto health. From Maranham Mr. St. John joined me at Pará, where I had an\r\nopportunity of comparing notes with him on the spot.\r\n\r\nDuring the first two months of his stay in Rio de Janeiro, Mr. Hartt was\r\nchiefly occupied with Mr. St. John in examining sections of the Dom\r\nPedro Railroad, of which he prepared a very clear and careful geological\r\nsurvey, with ample illustrations. On the 19th of June, 1865, he left the\r\ncity to explore the coast between the Rio Parahyba do Sul and Bahia;\r\nbeing accompanied by Mr. Edward Copeland, one of our volunteers, who\r\ngave him very efficient assistance in collecting, during the whole time\r\nthey remained together. At Campos, on the Rio Parahyba, they obtained a\r\nlarge number of fishes, beside other specimens. From that point they\r\nwent up the Rio Muriahy for some distance, and then, returning to\r\nCampos, ascended the Rio Parahyba to San Fidelis, where they again added\r\nlargely to their collections. Taking mules at San Fidelis, they\r\ntraversed the forest northward to Bom-Jesu, on the Rio Itabapuana, and\r\nthen descended that river, stopping to collect at Porto da Limeira and\r\nat the Barra. Thence they followed the coast to Victoria; and it was\r\ntheir intention to have proceeded northward to the Rio Doce, but, for\r\nwant of mules and money (their supplies having given out), they were\r\nobliged to make Nova Almeida, their farthest point. Thence they returned\r\nby way of Victoria to Rio de Janeiro in a sailing-vessel. In the course\r\nof this journey they obtained valuable collections both on the Rio\r\nItapemérim and at Guarapary. Mr. Hartt also made a careful study of the\r\ngeology of the coast, the result of which forms an interesting portion\r\nof his report.\r\n\r\nOn their return to Rio, Mr. Hartt and Mr. Copeland were detained for\r\nsome time by the failure of a steamer. They occupied themselves in the\r\nmean while in various work for the expedition, making excursions in the\r\nvicinity, and collecting in the harbor of Rio. Disappointed in the\r\nsteamer, they started on board a sailing-vessel, and had a slow and\r\ntedious voyage to San Matheos, collecting on their way wherever the\r\nstopping of the vessel enabled them to do so. Neither did Mr. Hartt\r\nneglect, on every such occasion, to examine the coast, and the phenomena\r\nconnected with its general rise, of which he obtained unquestionable\r\nevidence. From San Matheos, where they made considerable collections,\r\nthey took conveyance to the Rio Doce, and ascended this river for ninety\r\nmiles to the first fall, Porto de Souza. Descending its course again to\r\nLinhares, they explored the river and lake of Juparanaā, and then\r\nreturned to San Matheos; making large marine collections at Barra Secca,\r\nhalf-way between the Rio Doce and San Matheos. Thence they proceeded to\r\nthe Rio Mucury, stopping a few days at its mouth to collect, and then\r\nascending the river to Santa Clara. Here Mr. Copeland remained, and\r\nsecured a fine collection of fishes; while Mr. Hartt crossed over the\r\nriver Peruhype to the Colonia Leopoldina. On his return he was detained\r\nfor some days by illness, but was soon able to resume his journey; and\r\nhe and Mr. Copeland then went on with Mr. Schïeber[108] to Philadelphia,\r\nin the province of Minas Geraes, collecting on the way at the Rio Urucu,\r\nand afterwards at Philadelphia. Along the coast, and indeed throughout\r\nhis whole journey, Mr. Hartt continued his geological observations,\r\nwhich he carefully recorded. From Philadelphia he and his companion\r\nproceeded by land to Calháo, on the Rio Arassuahy; making a detour from\r\nAlahú to Alto dos Bois, in order to study the drift and the geological\r\nstructure of the elevated Chapadas. At Calháo they also made good\r\ncollections of fishes. Returning to Calháo from a visit to Minas Novas\r\nand a study of its gold-mines, Mr. Hartt descended the Rio Jequitinhonha\r\nthree hundred and sixty miles to the sea. Mr. Copeland had preceded him\r\nin order to make an excursion to Caravellas; and they met again at\r\nCannavieiras.\r\n\r\nAt Cannavieiras they made good collections, and then ascended the Rio\r\nPardo to its first fall, fishing and geologizing along their route. They\r\nvisited also Belmonte, and then went southward to Porto Seguro, where\r\nthey stayed for several days, collecting corals and marine\r\ninvertebrates. Here, as at several other points along the coast, Mr.\r\nHartt made a careful examination of the stone-reefs. His researches on\r\nthese “recifes,” which constitute so remarkable a feature along the\r\nAtlantic coast of Brazil, are exceedingly interesting; and I do not know\r\nthat any geologist has made a more careful and connected examination of\r\nthem. He believes them to be formed by the solidification of beach\r\nridges; the lower part of which being cemented by the lime dissolved\r\nfrom the shells contained in them remains intact, while the upper\r\nportion was carried off by storms; thus leaving a solid wall running\r\nalong the coast, broken through here and there, and divided from the\r\nland by a narrow channel. He studied the coast reefs both at Santa Cruz\r\nand at Porto Seguro, and ascertained their southward extension to the\r\nAbrolhos. From Porto Seguro Messrs. Hartt and Copeland went northward to\r\nBahia, touching at several points along the coast, and thence returned\r\nto Rio de Janeiro, whence we sailed together for the United States in\r\nthe month of July, 1866.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 108:\r\n\r\n  This gentleman, who is thoroughly familiar with the whole country, was\r\n  untiring in his attentions to Messrs. Hartt and Copeland, and gave\r\n  them, so far as he could, every facility for their researches.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Cambridge: Stereotyped and Printed by Welch, Bigelow, & Co.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n 1.
