S. SHALER,\r\n\r\nDEAN OF THE SCIENTIFIC SCHOOL OF HARVARD UNIVERSITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe experiments which have been intentionally or accidentally made in\r\ntransplanting organic species from the countries in which they have\r\nbeen developed to others of diverse soil, climate, and inhabitants\r\nare always of much interest to the naturalist--each of them affords\r\nindications of some value as to the relations of species to what\r\nwe term \"environment.\" In almost all instances we find that the\r\ntransplanted forms undergo changes in consequence of the alteration\r\nof their circumstances. It is true that certain of our domesticated\r\nanimals, such as the horse, the dog, and most cattle, follow men from\r\nthe Arctic to the Antarctic Circle, and that sundry insect pests\r\nappear to demand nothing of Nature save the presence of man; yet, as\r\na whole, the creatures we have turned to use, both plant and animal\r\nalike, have shown themselves incapable of accommodating themselves to\r\nconditions of temperature differing much from those in which they were\r\ndeveloped. With hardly an exception, species or varieties which have\r\nbeen developed in the tropics perish when called on to withstand the\r\nwinter of higher latitudes. Few, indeed, do well when taken to stations\r\nwhere the heat or the humidity differs greatly from that to which they\r\nare accustomed.\r\n\r\nThe intolerance of organisms to climatal changes is nowhere more\r\nevident than in the varieties, or species, as we would term them, of\r\nmankind. It is a well-attested fact that none of the tropical races\r\nhas ever of its own instance colonized in the temperate zones. It\r\nis also clear that none of the northern peoples have ever become\r\nfully acclimated within the tropical realm. The colonies which have\r\nbeen founded there by the Teutonic folk, including the English group\r\ntherein, have been lamentable failures, the pure-blooded strains dying\r\nout in a few generations. The people of southern Europe have been a\r\nlittle more successful in the equatorial regions, probably because\r\ntheir blood has there to a great extent become mingled with that of\r\ntropical origin. These general conclusions concerning the climatal\r\nlimitations of man would be unassailable were it not for the history\r\nof the negro in North America. In his case we have the one masterful\r\nexception to the rule, otherwise good, that creatures bred near the\r\nequator can not endure boreal conditions.\r\n\r\nThe negroes who came to North America had to undergo as complete a\r\ntransition as ever fell to the lot of man, without the least chance to\r\nundergo an acclimatizing process. They were brought from the hottest\r\npart of the earth to the region where the winter's cold is of almost\r\narctic severity--from an exceedingly humid to a very dry air. They\r\ncame to service under alien taskmasters, strange to them in speech and\r\nin purpose. They had to betake themselves to unaccustomed food and to\r\nclothing such as they had never worn before. Rarely could one of the\r\ncreatures find about him a familiar face of friend, parent, or child,\r\nor an object that recalled his past life to him. It was an appalling\r\nchange. Only those who know how the negro cleaves to all the dear,\r\nfamiliar things of life, how fond he is of warmth and friendliness, can\r\nconceive the physical and mental shock that this introduction to new\r\nconditions meant to them. To people of our own race it could have meant\r\ndeath. But these wonderful folk appear to have withstood the trials of\r\ntheir deportation in a marvelous way. They showed no peculiar liability\r\nto disease. Their longevity or period of usefulness was not diminished,\r\nor their fecundity obviously impaired. So far as I have been able to\r\nlearn, nostalgia was not a source of mortality, as it would have been\r\nwith any Aryan population. The price they brought in the market and the\r\nsatisfaction of their purchasers with their qualities shows that they\r\nwere from the first almost ideal laborers. If we compare the Algonkin\r\nIndian, in appearance a sturdy fellow, with these negroes, we see of\r\nwhat stuff the blacks are made. A touch of housework and of honest toil\r\ntook the breath of the aborigines away, but these tropical exotics fell\r\nto their tasks and trials far better than the men of our own kind could\r\nhave done.\r\n\r\nAt their first coming, or soon afterward, the negroes were distributed\r\nalong the coast of our country from the Carolinas to Nova Scotia.\r\nSo far as I have been able to find, there appears to have been no\r\ndistinct difference in their tolerance of the climate in any part of\r\nthis varied district. There are still negroes in the maritime provinces\r\nwho are said to be the descendants of those who came upon the ground\r\ncertainly more than a century ago. They are good specimens of their\r\nstock. So, too, along the New England coast and in New York there is\r\na sufficient number of the progeny of those once held as slaves to\r\nmake it clear that the failure to become a considerable part of the\r\npopulation in that district is not due to any incapacity to withstand\r\nthe climate. The failure of the negro to increase in this field can be\r\naccounted for in other ways--by the effects of race prejudice, nowhere\r\nstronger than in this part of the country, and by the vice and misery\r\nthat overtake a despised lower class.\r\n\r\nIt early became evident that slavery was to be of no permanent\r\neconomic advantage to any part of the colonies within the glaciated\r\ndistrict, say from central New Jersey northward. In that portion of the\r\ncoastal belt the state of the surface and the character of the crops\r\nalike tended to make the ownership of slaves unprofitable. The farms\r\nwere necessarily small. They became in a natural way establishments\r\nworked by the head of the house, with the help of his children. Such\r\nother help as was needed was, in the course of two generations,\r\nreadily had from hired white men and women. It was otherwise in the\r\ntobacco-planting region to the southward. The cultivation of that\r\nplant, to meet the extraordinary demands that Europe made for it, gave\r\nslavery its chance to become established in this country. But for\r\nthat industry the institution would most likely have taken but slight\r\nroot, and the territory as far south as North Carolina would have\r\nbeen in social order not very different from Pennsylvania, New York,\r\nand the New England settlements. But, owing to some peculiar, as yet\r\nunrecognized, adjustments of climate and soil, tobacco for pipes has\r\na quality when grown in the Virginia district such as it has nowhere\r\nelse in the world, and the world turned to smoking it with a disregard\r\nfor expense that made each laborer in the field worth some hundred\r\ndollars a year. Moreover, the production of good tobacco requires\r\nmuch care, which extends over about a year from the time the seed is\r\nplanted. Some parts of the work demand a measure of judgment such as\r\nintelligent negroes readily acquire. They are indeed better fitted for\r\nthe task than white men, for they are commonly more interested in their\r\ntasks than whites of the laboring class. The result was that before\r\nthe period of the Revolution slavery was firmly established in the\r\ntobacco-planting colonies of Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina. It\r\nwas already the foundation of their only considerable industry.\r\n\r\nAlthough the production of tobacco had made slavery a great economical\r\nsuccess in the limited field where the best product was to be had, it\r\nis doubtful if the institution would have attained to any widespread\r\nimportance but for the development of another form of planting--that\r\nof cotton. Thus, in Kentucky, where the crops, with the exception of\r\na coarse tobacco, are the same as in the other Northern States of the\r\nUnion, the institution, despite the long-continued scarcity of labor,\r\nnever attained any very great development. The slaves were generally\r\nused for household service, but to no great extent in the fields, and\r\nin such employment only in the districts where the soil was of such\r\ngreat fertility that large quantities of grain were raised for export.\r\nIn one third of that Commonwealth negroes were, and remain to this day,\r\nquite unknown. The invention of the cotton gin ended all hope that\r\nslavery might be limited to a part of the seacoast region, for nearly\r\nall of the lowland regions of the South, as well as some of the upland\r\ncountry north to the southern border of Kentucky and Virginia, are\r\nadmirably suited to that crop--producing, indeed, a better \"staple\"\r\nthan that of any other country. This industry, even more than that of\r\nraising tobacco, called for abundant labor which could be absolutely\r\ncommanded and severely tasked in the season of extreme heats. For this\r\nwork the negro proved to be the only fit man, for while the whites can\r\ndo this work they prefer other employment. Thus it came about that the\r\npower of slavery in this country became rooted in its soil. The facts\r\nshow that, based on an ample foundation of experience, the judgment\r\nof the Southern people was to the effect that this creature of the\r\ntropics was a better laborer in their fields than the men of their\r\nown race. Much has been said about the dislike of the white man for\r\nwork in association with negroes. The failure of the whites to have\r\na larger share in the agriculture of the South has been attributed\r\nto this cause. This seems to me clearly an error. The dislike to the\r\nassociation of races in labor is, in the slaveholding States, less than\r\nin the North. There can be no question that if the Southern folk could\r\nhave made white laborers profitable they would have preferred to employ\r\nthem, for the reason that the plantations would have required less\r\nfixed capital for their operation. The fact was and is that the negro\r\nis there a better laboring man in the field than the white. Under the\r\nconditions he is more enduring, more contented, and more trustworthy\r\nthan the men of our own race.\r\n\r\nThe large development of the cotton industry in this country came after\r\nthe importation of negroes from Africa had ceased to be as completely\r\nunrestricted as it was at first. The prohibition of the traffic came\r\nindeed before the needs of laborers in the more Southern and Western\r\nslave States had been met. For a while there was some surreptitious\r\nimportation, which in a small way continued down to the middle of\r\nthis century, but this smuggling was quite insufficient to supply the\r\nmarket of the new States with slaves. The result was that the border\r\nslaveholding States became to a considerable extent the breeding\r\ngrounds for men and women who were to be at maturity exported to the\r\ngreat plantations of Alabama and Mississippi, there to be herded by\r\noverseers in gangs of hundreds, with no hope of ever returning to their\r\nkindred. With this interdiction of the foreign slave trade the evils of\r\nthe former situation became magnified into horrors. The folk who were\r\nbrought from Africa came from a state of savagery to one of relative\r\ncomfort. When once adjusted to their new conditions, their lot was\r\non the whole greatly bettered. But their descendants, who had become\r\nattached to the places where they were born with the peculiar affection\r\nthe better of them had for their homes, being accustomed to masters who\r\non the whole were gentle, were now to undergo a worse deportation than\r\nthat which made them slaves. It is not too much to say that the deeper\r\nevils of the system to the slaves themselves, as well as to their\r\nmasters, began with this miserable slave trade that went on within the\r\nlimits of this country, and was about at its height when the civil war\r\nbegan.\r\n\r\nIt can not be denied that even in the best stages of slaveholding\r\nthere had been a good deal of commerce in slaves where the feelings of\r\nthese chattels were in no wise regarded. Still, there was a prevailing\r\nsentiment among all the slaveholders of the gentler sort that it was\r\nin a way disgraceful to part families. I distinctly recall, when I was\r\na lad, some years before the civil war, my maternal grandfather often\r\ncharged me to remember that I came of a people who had never bought or\r\nsold a slave except to keep families together. I know that this was a\r\ncommon feeling among the better men of Kentucky and Virginia, and that\r\nthe practice of rearing negroes for the Southern market filled them\r\nwith sorrow and indignation. Yet the change was the inevitable result\r\nof the system and of the advancing commercialism which separated the\r\nplantation life more and more from that of the owner's household. At\r\nthe time when the civil war began the institution of slavery was, from\r\nthe commercial point of view, eminently successful. Notwithstanding\r\nthe occasional appearance of the spendthrift slave owner in Northern\r\npleasure resorts or in Europe, the great plantations were generally\r\nin charge of able business men, who won a large interest on their\r\ninvestments and who were developing the system of planting in a way\r\nwhich, though it appeared to those who were accustomed to close\r\ntillage as shiftless, was really well adjusted to the conditions.\r\nNot one fourth of the land of the Southern States that was well\r\nfitted for the work of slaves had been brought into use. The blacks\r\nwho were carefully managed in all that regarded their health and\r\nin their morals, so far as might affect their breeding, were in\r\nadmirable physical condition, and rapidly increasing in numbers. It\r\nis doubtful if ever a peasant class was so well cared for or so freed\r\nfrom avoidable diseases. The growing protest against the institution,\r\nso far as it operated in the South, was practically limited to the\r\nborder States, mainly to Kentucky, where alone did a considerable\r\nnumber of well-born men set themselves against it. There is good reason\r\nto believe that if the civil war had not occurred the end of the\r\nnineteenth century would have seen a negro population in the South much\r\nmore numerous than we now have there. Experience has shown that the\r\nAmerican cotton crop is little affected by foreign competition, so that\r\nit would have maintained the success of the institution.\r\n\r\nAlthough the system of slavery was by a chance of Nature so firmly\r\nplanted on the cotton fields as to give it entire dominance in the\r\nSouth, and something like control of the Federal Union, there was\r\none geographic condition that menaced its future, and in the end did\r\nmuch to insure its downfall in the events of the civil war, and most\r\nlikely would have brought about its end even if the Confederacy had\r\nbeen established. This was the form and extent of the Appalachian\r\nuplands between the Potomac and the Ohio on the north and Alabama and\r\nGeorgia in the South. In this area of nearly one hundred and fifty\r\nthousand square miles in extent the surface lies at an average height\r\nof some fifteen hundred feet above the sea; the good arable land\r\nis found mostly in narrow valleys suited only for household farms,\r\ntotally unfit for the systematic agriculture in which alone negroes\r\ncould be profitably employed as slaves. Into this area drifted the\r\nclass of small farmers who by one chance and another had never been\r\nable to enter or to maintain themselves in the aristocratic class of\r\nslaveholders. These mountaineers--they may better be termed the hill\r\npeople of the South--were an eminently peculiar people. They are not\r\nto be compared with the \"poor white trash\"--i.e., the downfallen and\r\ndependent whites, who were broken men in spirit, scarce above the\r\nslaves in quality. These poor whites were often, if not generally,\r\neither the weaker strains of the militant families or the descendants\r\nof the people who had been imported into this country by the land\r\ncompanies or sent out as peons.\r\n\r\nPartly because of their separation from the slaveholding class and\r\npartly because of the circumstances of their origin, the people of\r\nthe Southern highlands formed a curiously separated class. They\r\nretained the quality of their English stock, as they had brought it\r\nwith them--an independence, a carelessness as to life, and a humor for\r\nquarreling with those who were set above them whenever their liberties\r\nor their license seemed to be threatened. Even their customs and\r\nutensils held with curious adhesion to the usages of earlier centuries.\r\nThus, in 1878, I found, in a secluded valley of southwestern Virginia,\r\nmen hunting squirrels and rabbits with the old English short bow.\r\nThese were not the contrivances of boys or of to-day, but were made\r\nand strung and the arrows hefted in the ancient manner. The men, one\r\nof them old, were admirably skilled in their use; they assured me\r\nthat, like their fathers before them, they had ever used the bow and\r\narrow for small game, reserving the costly ammunition of the rifle for\r\ndeer and bear. These hill folk were, in a passive but obdurate manner,\r\nopposed to slavery, and even more to negroes. There are still many\r\ncounties in this district where a negro has never dwelt. In some parts\r\nof it I have had people gather from twenty miles away to stare at my\r\nblack camp servants, as the folk of central Africa are said to do at a\r\nwhite man.\r\n\r\nAt the outbreak of the civil war the Appalachian upland was still\r\nthinly peopled; it was, however, fitted to maintain a population\r\nof some millions. If the Confederacy had won its independence, its\r\nplantation districts, with a relatively small voting population, would\r\nsoon have had to settle an account with the people of the hills. As it\r\nwas, the existence of this folk in a great ridge of country extending\r\nfrom the Northern States to within two hundred miles of the Gulf of\r\nMexico was an element of weakness which went far to give success to the\r\nFederal arms. It kept Kentucky from seceding, prevented the region of\r\nWest Virginia from being of any value to the rebellion, and weakened\r\nits control in several other States. In all, somewhere near one hundred\r\nthousand recruits came to the Federal army from this part of the South.\r\nIt is not improbable that to this folk we may attribute the failure of\r\nthe great revolt. That they turned thus against the people of their own\r\nStates to cast in their lot with those who were strangers to them shows\r\ntheir feelings toward the institution of slavery; it indicated where\r\nthey would have stood if the Confederacy had been established.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to picture the condition of the negro population in\r\n1860. There is a common notion that it was consciously and bitterly\r\nsuffering from its subjugation--ready to rise in arms against its\r\noppressors. This view was indeed shared by the Southern people, who\r\nlived in chronic fear of insurrections. The error of it arose from the\r\nfallacious notion that the people of another race must feel and act as\r\nwe would under like circumstances. The facts showed that the negro mind\r\ndoes not work in the fashion of our own. He had, it is true, suffered\r\nfrom slavery, but not as men of our race would have suffered. Against\r\nits deprivations and such direct cruelty as he experienced, not often\r\ngreat, he could set the simple comforts and small pleasures which are\r\nso much to him. That he was on the whole fairly contented with his\r\nlot, that his relations with his masters were on the whole friendly,\r\nis shown by his remarkable conduct during and since the civil war. If\r\nthe accepted account of the negro had been true, if he had been for\r\ngenerations groaning in servitude while he passionately longed for\r\nliberty, the South should have flamed in insurrection at the first\r\ntouch of war. We should have seen a repetition of the horrors of many a\r\nservile insurrection. It is a most notable fact that, during the four\r\nyears of the great contention, when the blacks had every opportunity\r\nto rise, there was no real mark of a disposition to turn upon their\r\nmasters. On thousands of Southern farms the fighting men left their\r\nwomen and children in the keeping of their slaves, while they went\r\nforth for a cause whose success meant that those slaves could never be\r\nfree.\r\n\r\nThat the negroes desired to be free is plain enough. The fact that\r\nthey fled in such numbers to our camps shows this. Their failure to\r\nrevolt must be taken as an indication that their relations with their\r\nmasters measured on their own instinctive standards were on the whole\r\naffectionate. They had the strength to have made an end of the war\r\nat a stroke. They were brave enough for such action. That they did\r\nnot take it after the manner of their kindred of Santo Domingo is\r\nthe best possible testimony as to the generally sympathetic relation\r\nwhich existed between master and slaves. Of this no better test can be\r\nimagined than that which the final stages of the institution afforded.\r\n\r\nIn taking account of the history of the slave in this Union it is\r\nnot amiss for me to bear testimony as to the spirit with which the\r\nbody of our slave owners met the singular obligations of their\r\npositions. There were here and there base men who abused their trust\r\nas masters--some, indeed, who never perceived its existence. But\r\nof the very many slave owners whom I can remember I can recall but\r\nthree who failed to recognize the burden that fate had put upon them\r\nand to deal with it much as they dealt with the other cares of their\r\nhouseholds--conscientiously and mercifully, though often in the rude\r\nwhacking way in which parents of old dealt with their children; so far\r\nas slavery was a household affair, and even where the farm employed no\r\nmore hands than could be gathered in a house \"quarter,\" the people were\r\ncommonly subject to an anxious scrutiny as regarded their moral and\r\nreligious training. Here and there, especially when there were young\r\nwhite men about, the result was the deplorable mixture of the races.\r\nThere is no question but that this was extensive, though the amount\r\nof it is exaggerated. Yet it was common enough to degrade the whites\r\nand to make of itself a sufficient reason for ending the institution,\r\nhowever profitable it might otherwise have been. Men of no race are\r\nsafely to be trusted with such power. The social evil was the heaviest\r\npart of the load which the high-minded slave owners had to bear. It was\r\nshared in even larger measure by his wife and daughters. How heavy the\r\ncross was can only be known to those who remember the conditions of\r\nthat unhappy time.\r\n\r\nThe result of the hopeless effort to keep the slaves in decent ways\r\nand to prevent the pollution of their sons was to make nearly every\r\nright-minded slaveholder at heart an abolitionist. Although the\r\nmen, and even the women, who suffered most would have been disposed\r\nto slay any one who suggested that they shared the opinions of the\r\ndetested antislavery folk, nearly every one in his heart reprobated\r\nthe institution and in his mind was revolving some scheme, generally\r\nfanciful, by which an end of it might be made. They were in the unhappy\r\nposition where overwhelming self-interest fought with their moral\r\nsense. Now and then some one of them passed the critical point and\r\nentered into the fold of the accursed abolitionists; but others, after\r\nthe manner of average men, paltered with the situation, waiting for\r\nfate to decide the matter. In the meantime, they strove as best they\r\ncould to lift these people to a higher estate.\r\n\r\nIn many ways the standard of care by which the conduct of a master\r\nin relation to his slaves was judged was high. He was expected to\r\nclothe them in a fit manner, keep them from the nocturnal wanderings,\r\ntermed \"running,\" so common a trait in these children of the tropics,\r\nto see that they were decently married, that they went to church in\r\na dutiful way, and, above all, that they were not abused by other\r\nwhites, particularly by other slaveholders. To strike or even to vilify\r\nthe slaves of another was a very serious thing. The offended person\r\nknew well that it was his part to make his complaint to the servant's\r\nmaster. Where the negroes exceeded in number those needed for household\r\nand personal service--there were often a dozen or two thus employed\r\nin families of no great wealth--there was a division between the\r\nhouse people and the \"hands.\" Those in the former group were selected\r\nfolk, often belonging to families that had been associated with those\r\nof their masters for a century or more. Such servants had rights\r\nthat none could dispute. Not uncommonly their elders were the actual\r\nrulers of the establishment. These family slaves often received some\r\nlittle schooling, even when the laws forbade that slaves should be\r\ntaught to read and write. The children of the household servants were\r\nallowed freely to play with those of their masters until the young\r\npeople were about twelve years old. The boys of both often had their\r\nrough-and-tumble games together until they were young men. The field\r\nlaborers, where the class was separate, had less perfect connection\r\nwith their masters. They usually came to the family storeroom for\r\nthe daily issued rations, which they received from the hands of the\r\nmistress or the daughter of the house. They were visited when sick,\r\nand their complaints were heard. They were free to all of the many\r\nfestivities of the holiday time.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to conceive of a more effective schooling for the\r\nAfrican people than was given this adoption into the households, and\r\noften into the hearts, of high-minded masters. A like opportunity never\r\nbefore came and will never again come to so lowly a folk. The effect\r\nof this educative contact with the superior race is, as before noted,\r\nto be seen in the temper of the negroes during and after the civil\r\nwar. Upon the high-minded master the effect of the institution was in\r\nmany ways enlarging. A man is morally what his cares have made him,\r\nand of these the dutiful slaveholder has more than an average share.\r\nHe grew in the power of command and in the habit of doing justice to\r\nmany fellow-beings. He lived a large life. The qualities bred of his\r\nstation have been of profit to his folk and time. All this is true of\r\nslavery of the domestic sort. It is not so in like manner of the great\r\nplantations which came with the development of the cotton and sugar\r\nindustries. It was characteristic of the northern part of the South\r\nuntil it began to be the place of supply for the rapidly developing\r\nplantation district.\r\n\r\nSo long as the negro could look forward to life in the place and\r\nwith the people of his birth his simple, careless nature opened to\r\nhim little to bring a sense of danger. He was to live on until he\r\npassed in to the Elysium of the hereafter, of which he had no doubt\r\nwhatever. Gradually there came, in the overcrowding of the farms and\r\nthe diminishing fertility of the wasted land, the need of reducing\r\nthe number of slaves. Then each year came the dreaded visits of the\r\n\"trader,\" who was like a visible angel of death, to lead one or more\r\ninto the far unknown country. Before the plantation demand for slaves\r\nbegan there were, of course, sales of slaves, but they commonly went as\r\nfamilies, and not to places to them inconceivably remote. These could\r\nhope for Christmas reunions and other exchanges, but when the negro\r\nwas \"sold South\" the place and people that had known him would know him\r\nno more. My first impression of the iniquity of slavery came from the\r\nanxious questions of negroes as to the danger of their being sold to\r\nAlabama, that State being then the supposed destination of all those\r\nwho were out of favor. They naturally strove to make interest with\r\nchildren whom they thought could successfully intercede for them.\r\n\r\nThere were several very diverse consequences arising from the\r\nexportation of slaves from the border States to the far South. It\r\nshook the confidence of the negro as to his safety in all that was\r\ndearest to him, and thus did much to degrade the relation between him\r\nand his master. It served, cruel as it was, to elevate the relatively\r\nuncivilized blacks of the more Southern districts, where the newly\r\nimported laborers were mostly accumulated. It curiously operated to\r\nelevate the quality of the blacks in what was termed the slave-breeding\r\nStates, those where the institution had longest been established. This\r\nwas due to the selection of those of lower grade for the market. As\r\nit became necessary to part with slaves, a choice was naturally made\r\nof men and women who had least endeared themselves to the household.\r\nSave in rare cases, the trader sought rather the lusty youths for their\r\nbrawn than the more delicate, refined house people. Moreover, where\r\na fellow had shown a tendency to any vice, the choice fell on him.\r\nIn this way for two or three generations a weeding process went on,\r\nwith the result that the negroes who were left in the districts where\r\nthe work was done acquired a quality noticeably better than those on\r\nthe Southern plantations. The difference is almost that we would look\r\nfor between two distinct races. The faces of the selected folk are\r\nmore intelligent, the lines of their bodies finer, their moral and\r\nintellectual quality very much above those of their lower kindred. They\r\nare at their best, in very numerous instances, as gentle as the elect\r\nof our own race.\r\n\r\nWhere, as in the Southern plantations, the institution of slavery was\r\ndeliberately made the basis of large commercial interests, the motives\r\nwere wholly different from whatever existed in the early and better\r\ndays, when the slaves were appendages of a household. Even on the\r\nlargest tobacco plantations the numbers were not such as to exclude a\r\nshare of contact with friendly whites. But on the great properties of\r\nthe South the negro was not to any extent subject to the influences\r\nwhich had in the earlier stage of his apprenticeship done so much for\r\nhim. Worked in gangs that were counted by the hundreds, seeing no\r\nwhites except the overseers, they tended to lose what little culture\r\nthey had gained. Their peculiar but perfectly intelligible speech\r\nbegan a degradation into a puzzling jargon. African superstitions,\r\nlittle if any trace of which remained among their kindred in Virginia\r\nand Kentucky, regained their hold. Marriage and a respect therefor,\r\nwhich had been tolerably well affirmed, tended to disappear. All trace\r\nof good thus vanished from the system.\r\n\r\nAlthough the great plantation, of the Mississippi type, was a\r\nrelatively novel feature in American slaveholding, it was evidently the\r\nonly largely profitable method of using slave labor. In the household\r\nsystem the care of the children, the aged, and the infirm, the\r\nunbusinesslike management of the labor, and the tendency to slipshod\r\nmethods which with negroes can only be corrected by strict discipline,\r\nmade ordinary farming unremunerative. It is evident that the profit,\r\nother than that in mere money, which the institution in the earlier\r\nstate had brought to master and slave was rapidly diminishing, and that\r\nany further maintenance of it would have been calamitous. Though we may\r\nregret that it was ended by the civil war, it is difficult to see any\r\nother way in which it could have been terminated, or any profit which\r\ncould have been gained by postponing the crisis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMODERN CITY ROADWAYS.\r\n\r\nBY NELSON P. LEWIS,\r\n\r\nENGINEER OF HIGHWAYS, BOROUGH OF BROOKLYN.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the conspicuous results of cheapened transportation and the\r\nfacility with which the products of field, forest, mine, and factory\r\ncan be transferred to the consumer has been the rapid increase in\r\npopulation of all our cities. In 1890 over forty-five per cent of the\r\npopulation of New York State (nearly six millions) was concentrated in\r\nfour cities, while it is estimated that the greater city of New York\r\ncontains at present not less and probably more than fifty per cent of\r\nthe State's population. Nor is this tendency characteristic only of\r\nAmerican cities, though the general impression seems to be that it is\r\nmore conspicuous with us. In fact, many European cities (notably those\r\nof Germany) have outstripped ours in growth. In 1870 Berlin had about\r\n150,000 less people than New York; in 1890 it had over 73,000 more. In\r\n1875 Hamburg exceeded Boston in population by but 6,000, while in 1890\r\nthe German city was more than 121,000 ahead.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the rural population the world over has increased very\r\nslowly, or has positively decreased. The massing together of large\r\nnumbers of people, without proper regard to sanitary conditions, has\r\nalways resulted in great mortality, as witness the terrible plagues\r\nwhich have swept over the old cities of Europe, and the disastrous\r\nresults during the summer of 1898 of concentrating large numbers of our\r\nvolunteers in camps not subjected to rigid sanitary regulations.\r\n\r\nIt has been amply demonstrated, however, that our cities can be made at\r\nleast as healthful as the country districts, and an increasingly large\r\nnumber of engineers are engaged in such city building.\r\n\r\nOne branch of this municipal work will be considered in this\r\npaper--that of street improvement. The first impression gained by a\r\nstranger entering a city is undoubtedly that produced by the appearance\r\nof its streets. If they are poorly paved, irregular, dirty, and\r\ngenerally unkempt, he will consult his time table to see how soon\r\nhe can get away. If they are broad, smooth, clean, well shaded and\r\nlighted, he will stay as long as possible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SECTIONS OF ROMAN ROADS]\r\n\r\nIn spite of the pride of the American people in the development of our\r\ncities, and notwithstanding the fact that their wealth enables them\r\nto have only the best, they have been slow to appreciate the value of\r\nthoroughly well-paved streets. As stated by Mr. Albert Shaw, European\r\ncities have been ahead of us in accepting the doctrine that \"smooth and\r\nclean highways are a wise investment from every point of view, and that\r\nso long as the work is done in a thorough and scientific manner the\r\nresult is worth having, regardless of cost. No city should think itself\r\nrich enough to prosper without them, and no city is so poor that it can\r\nnot afford them if it has any reason whatever for continued existence.\r\nGood roadways are cheap at any cost, and bad ones are so disastrously\r\nexpensive that only a very rich country, like the United States, can\r\nafford them.\"\r\n\r\nSpace will not permit even a brief history of street paving, or an\r\nattempt to sketch its development, but reference will be made to the\r\ndifferent kinds in general use, and the kind most in favor in various\r\ncities. Probably no one has introduced the subject of pavements without\r\nreference to the Roman roads.\r\n\r\nWhile Carthage was probably the first city to boast of paved streets,\r\nthe Romans soon followed its example, and all over Europe, Asia, and\r\nAfrica, as far as the domain of their emperors extended, they built\r\nwith the greatest care and at enormous expense that magnificent system\r\nof roads which were often supposed, in the middle ages, to be of\r\nsupernatural origin, and remain the wonder of our modern civilization.\r\nThese roads were generally from four to six metres in width, and were\r\nconstructed in this way: The roadbed was excavated; in it was placed a\r\nlayer of stones, which were sometimes united with mortar. These stones\r\nwere such as were most available, sometimes rounded stones similar to\r\nthe cobblestones with which we are familiar, and in some cases in the\r\nAlps the foundation was a compact mass of angular stones, two feet or\r\nmore in their longest dimension, carefully fitted together.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A STREET IN POMPEII, SHOWING OLD ROMAN PAVEMENT.]\r\n\r\nOn this foundation was placed a layer of plaster made of stone or brick\r\npounded with mortar; then a course of sand and lime or sand and clay,\r\nleveled and pounded until very hard. The top or wearing surface was\r\nmade of irregular flat stones, fitted together with nicety and united\r\nwith cement. The total depth of these roads, or pavements, as they can\r\nproperly be called, was from three to (in some cases) seven feet. It is\r\nsaid that in the province of Hispania alone (Spain and Portugal) twenty\r\nthousand miles of roads were built.\r\n\r\nThe first stone pavements to be laid in modern city streets were\r\nthose formed of stones in their natural condition, variously known as\r\nbowlders, pebbles, or cobblestones.\r\n\r\nThe first attempt at a street pavement in this country was doubtless\r\nthat referred to by Mrs. John King Van Rensselaer, in the _Goede Vrouw\r\nof Mana-na-ta_, where she says, in speaking of what was once called\r\nBrower Street, because it passed by the great brewery built by one of\r\nthe first of the Van Cortlandts: \"This street lies between Whitehall\r\nand Broad, and was one of the first lanes laid out by the settlers, and\r\nwas commonly known as 'The Road.' In 1657 it was paved with small round\r\ncobblestones, and the circumstance created such a sensation that the\r\ncountry people visited it as a curiosity, and it was one of the sights\r\nof the little dorp. The burghers laughingly nicknamed it Stone Street,\r\nwhich name it still retains. The improvement was effected by Madame Van\r\nCortlandt, as she could not endure the dust that filled her tidy house,\r\ncaused by the heavy brewers' wains that were constantly passing her\r\ndoor.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A STREET IN NAPLES, SHOWING LARGE PAVING STONES.]\r\n\r\nThis cobblestone pavement, laid on Stone Street nearly two centuries\r\nand a half ago, has been a persistent type, and, on account of\r\ntheir availability and cheapness, such stones continued to be used\r\nin many cities until within a very few years. When they were well\r\nshaped and uniform in size they made quite a durable pavement, and,\r\nthough rough and noisy, were capable, when well laid, of sustaining a\r\nconsiderable traffic. Fortunately, the better class of these stones\r\nare now so scarce and the poorer ones are so execrable that this type\r\nof pavement is becoming obsolete, though there are many miles for\r\nwhich more civilized pavements are yet to be substituted, two hundred\r\nand thirty-eight miles of which are unfortunately in the Borough of\r\nBrooklyn. The next step in advance was the use of stone shaped to\r\nuniform size, or approximately so, and with a more or less smooth\r\nsurface. This is the pavement in most general use to-day, and for\r\npermanency and, consequently, cheapness can not be surpassed. When\r\nfirst used, these blocks were quite large, and the size has been\r\ndecreased until the best stone pavements laid at the present time in\r\nGreat Britain are six-inch cubes, or still smaller, with a surface four\r\ninches square and a depth of seven inches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COBBLESTONE PAVEMENT ON SARATOGA AVENUE, BROOKLYN.]\r\n\r\nBut stone pavement when most carefully laid and maintained is noisy and\r\nunpleasant to ride over, and in these days we can never reconcile such\r\na pavement with a handsome residence street. The writer experienced a\r\ndistinct shock when on riding over Euclid Avenue, in Cleveland, last\r\nyear, he found it still paved with Medina sandstone blocks, and it\r\nseemed that this famous street was still living on the reputation which\r\nBayard Taylor gave it years ago as the handsomest street in the world.\r\n\r\nIn looking about for something more quiet and smooth than stone, the\r\nfirst material tried was wood. In London the first wood pavement was\r\nlaid in the Old Bailey in 1839, and was soon followed by many others.\r\nNone of these pavements lasted more than seven years, and, as they cost\r\nmore than granite and were so short-lived, a prejudice arose against\r\nthem, and as they wore out they were mostly replaced with granite.\r\nSince that time wood pavement has become popular again, and a large\r\narea is now covered with it. The material most generally in use is\r\nBaltic fir, though there is quite a large amount of Australian hard\r\nwood which is more durable. The people of London seem willing to bear\r\nthe greater expense and submit to the annoyance of more frequent\r\nrenewals for the sake of the quiet, and wood is certainly the least\r\nnoisy of all known pavements.\r\n\r\nParis had at the close of 1893 more wood than asphalt, the areas of\r\npavements of different kinds being as follows:\r\n\r\n  Stone                7,541,258 sq. yds., 71.5 per cent.\r\n  Wood                   886,236    \"       8.4    \"\r\n  Asphalt                402,394    \"       3.8    \"\r\n  Gravel or macadam    1,724,632    \"      16.3    \"\r\n\r\nBerlin also has some wood pavements, but asphalt seems more popular,\r\nthough by far the greatest area is still of stone pavements.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GRANITE PAVEMENT ON ROADWAY OF BROOKLYN BRIDGE AFTER\r\nCONSTANT USE WITH VERY HEAVY TRAFFIC FOR SIXTEEN YEARS.]\r\n\r\nThe most durable wood pavements are those made of the hard woods of\r\nAustralia, which are especially adapted to this purpose. They are\r\nmostly of the eucalyptus family, the red gum, blue gum, black butt,\r\ntallow-wood, and mahogany. Mr. George W. Bell, in a pamphlet published\r\nin 1895, gives some remarkable statistics as to the durability of\r\nthese pavements. He cites the case of George Street, in Sydney, which\r\nsustains a very heavy traffic, and on which a wooden-block pavement\r\nhad been in constant use for over ten years, without repair of any\r\nkind. The only piece of wood pavement of this class which has been\r\nlaid in this country, to the writer's knowledge, is on Twentieth\r\nStreet, between Broadway and Fifth Avenue, in the Borough of Manhattan,\r\nwhere, in 1896, the Australian \"kari\" wood was laid. The work was done\r\nwith the greatest care, and the resulting pavement has proved quite\r\nsatisfactory. When Fifth Avenue was lately repaved the use of this\r\nmaterial was considered, but, on account of the popular prejudice\r\nagainst all wood pavements and the delay which would be involved in\r\nobtaining the blocks, the idea was abandoned.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LOOKING NORTH FROM BEVERLY ROAD AND EAST FIFTEENTH\r\nSTREET, BROOKLYN, IN MARCH, 1899.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LOOKING NORTH FROM BEVERLY ROAD AND EAST FIFTEENTH\r\nSTREET, BROOKLYN, IN OCTOBER, 1899.]\r\n\r\nWhen wood pavements are spoken of in most of our cities, the taxpayer\r\npictures to himself the round cedar block so generally in use in\r\nWestern cities. These are used on account of their cheapness. They are\r\nusually laid on one or two courses of plank. The blocks are round,\r\nfrom four to eight inches in diameter and six inches in depth, are\r\nset as closely as possible to each other, and the joints are filled\r\nwith gravel, after which they are usually poured full of pitch. Such a\r\npavement, when new, is quite agreeable to ride over. It soon, however,\r\nbecomes uneven; the defective blocks quickly decay; the surface not\r\nbeing impervious to water, the wet foundation under a pavement with so\r\nlittle rigidity becomes soft, and the mud or slime works its way up\r\nbetween the blocks, and the process of decomposition is expedited. We\r\nhear sometimes of the floating pavements of Chicago. These are such\r\ncedar-block pavements which are said to rise with the floods of water\r\nfilling the roadways after heavy rainfalls, and from specimens of the\r\npavement which may be seen in that city considerable sections must\r\nhave floated away. The round block has nothing to recommend it but\r\nits cheapness, and this usually proves to be expensive economy. In\r\nGalveston, Texas, creosoted yellow pine blocks have been laid for some\r\nyears with general satisfaction. They are laid directly on the fine\r\nsand, which is water-rammed so as to be very compact. The surface is\r\nformed with great care by a template to the exact grade and crown, and\r\nthe joints are filled with similar fine sand. In Indianapolis creosoted\r\nblocks have been laid for several years, sixty thousand square yards\r\nhaving been put down during the past season. They are laid as closely\r\nas possible on a concrete foundation, with a sand cushion of one inch,\r\nand the joints filled with paving cement, composed of ten per cent of\r\nrefined Trinidad asphalt and ninety per cent of coal-tar distillate,\r\nafter which the surface is covered with half an inch of clean coarse\r\nsand or granite screenings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A NEW CEDAR BLOCK PAVEMENT IN TORONTO.]\r\n\r\nImproved wood pavements are a luxury. They have many points of\r\nsuperiority over asphalt. They are so considered in London, where\r\ntheir use is continued, although they require renewal oftener than\r\nasphalt, and much more often than granite. They will undoubtedly be\r\nused more frequently in this country when the people are willing to pay\r\nthe additional cost for the quiet and freedom from dust and from the\r\nsomewhat disagreeable glare of asphalt.\r\n\r\nFor a dozen years or more brick has been used for street pavements\r\nin the cities of the middle West. The use of this material is by no\r\nmeans new. It began in Holland in the thirteenth century, and in the\r\nseventeenth century the highway from The Hague to Scheveningen was\r\npaved with brick. In Amsterdam such pavements are said to last from ten\r\nto twenty years, or an average of fourteen years. After about ten years\r\nthey are commonly turned over and relaid, after which they will last\r\nabout four years more. The size in common use is about the same as that\r\nmade in this country.\r\n\r\nA good paving brick should be tough enough to withstand the wear to\r\nwhich a street surface is subjected without chipping or cracking, and\r\nshould not absorb more than from two to four per cent of its weight\r\nof water after submersion for forty-eight hours. It has not the\r\nwearing qualities of granite, although there is one block on Ninth\r\nAvenue, in the Borough of Manhattan, which has been subjected to very\r\nheavy traffic for eight years, has had no repairs to speak of, and\r\nits condition to-day compares very favorably with almost any street\r\npavement of equal age which has been subjected to similar traffic.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN OLD CEDAR BLOCK PAVEMENT.]\r\n\r\nAnother kind of street improvement which must be considered is macadam.\r\nIn small towns, and some quite large cities, most of the streets are\r\nimproved in this way. When well maintained and kept smooth, but not too\r\nhard, it forms a most agreeable surface for driving. It should not, in\r\nthe writer's judgment, be classed as a pavement at all, certainly not\r\nas a permanent one, and its use should be restricted to park drives\r\nand boulevards (for maintaining which liberal appropriations can be\r\nsecured), and to suburban roads, where sewers and subsurface pipes have\r\nnot yet been laid, and where temporary roads are required to furnish\r\nconvenient communication between centers of population, and to assist\r\nin developing these districts.\r\n\r\nMacadam has no place in a city street, nor is it wise to lay it on the\r\nentire width of a roadway. It best serves its purpose when laid in a\r\ncomparatively narrow strip, leaving the sides of the road unimproved,\r\nexcept for the formation of earth gutters, so that the surface water\r\ncan readily soak away where the soil is sufficiently porous.\r\n\r\nMacadam is the most expensive of all street surfaces to keep in\r\nthoroughly good condition, and in this country it is rarely, if ever,\r\nso maintained, except in some of our park roads.\r\n\r\nThe pavement which is to-day, more generally than any other,\r\nsuperseding stone on all streets where the traffic is not excessive\r\nnor the grades extreme, is asphalt. It is scarcely necessary to attempt\r\nto give a history of the use of this material, how its adaptability\r\nto paving purposes was first discovered by the improved condition of\r\nthe roads over which it was hauled from the French mines for use in\r\nreservoir and tank linings, etc. The drippings from the carts were\r\nobserved to have been compacted by travel until a smooth, hard roadway\r\nresulted. The first street to be paved with it was Rue Bergera, in\r\nParis, in 1854, and it was so successful that in 1858 Rue St. Honore\r\nwas similarly treated. An asphalt pavement was laid in Threadneedle\r\nStreet, London, in May, 1869, and in Cheapside and Poultry in the fall\r\nof 1870, while in Berlin its use began in 1873.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EIGHTEENTH AVENUE, BROOKLYN; MACADAMIZED FULL WIDTH OF\r\nROADWAY AND GUTTERS PAVED, WITH NO PROVISION FOR SURFACE DRAINAGE.]\r\n\r\nThe laying of bituminous pavements in this country began in 1869, and\r\nthey were first made of tar concrete, or Scrimshaw. Asphalt began\r\nto be used within the next year or two, and its popularity has been\r\nastonishing, as will be seen from the fact that on January 1, 1898, the\r\narea of this kind of pavement laid in the United States was, as nearly\r\nas could be ascertained, thirty million square yards.\r\n\r\nThere is a notable difference between the European and American\r\nasphalts. The former may be called natural and the latter artificial\r\npavements. In the former the material, as it comes from the mine, is\r\nground to a powder, heated, placed upon the foundation prepared for\r\nit, and tamped into approximately the same condition as before it\r\nwas disturbed, though usually the product of several mines is mixed\r\nin order to obtain the best percentage of bitumen, but nothing is\r\nadded to or taken from the bituminous rock. In the pavement usually\r\nlaid in America, on the other hand, only a small proportion of the\r\nmaterial is brought from the asphalt deposits, the principal part of\r\nit (sand) being obtained near at hand. In the one case the cost of\r\nlong ocean or rail transportation has to be paid on the entire mass\r\nforming the pavement, while in the other this expense attaches to but\r\nfrom twelve to fifteen per cent of the material. This, of course, is a\r\ngreat advantage, and at recent prices it is scarcely possible for the\r\nEuropean rock asphalts to compete with the artificial ones.\r\n\r\nThe making of a pavement from one of the standard asphalts may be\r\nbriefly described as follows: The material as found in Nature has this\r\ncomposition:\r\n\r\n  Bitumen                          38.14 per cent.\r\n  Organic matter, not bitumen       7.63    \"\r\n  Mineral matter                   26.38    \"\r\n  Water                            27.85    \"\r\n                                  ------\r\n                                  100.00\r\n\r\nThis is cooked until the water has been driven off, and some of the\r\nmineral matter has settled.\r\n\r\nThe above analysis is of Trinidad Pitch Lake asphalt, and is a\r\nparticularly favorable result. This material is too hard for use in\r\nmaking a pavement, and it has to be softened or fluxed by the addition\r\nof something which will accomplish this purpose. In order to do this\r\nthere is usually added to each one hundred pounds of refined asphalt\r\nabout eighteen pounds of heavy petroleum oil. After this addition we\r\nhave the asphaltic cement ready to combine with mineral matter, which\r\nis so selected that when asphaltic cement is added at the rate of about\r\nseventeen pounds of the cement to eighty-three pounds of the other\r\nall the particles will be coated, and more could not be added without\r\nmaking the pavement too soft. What is found to accomplish this best is\r\nfine stone dust and sand.\r\n\r\nThe asphaltic cement and sand are heated separately to about 300° F.\r\nThe stone dust is then added to and mixed with the hot sand in the\r\nproportion of from five to eighty in the case of fine, well-graduated\r\nsand, to fifteen to sixty-seven for coarse sands, having less variation\r\nin size. The asphaltic cement is then added, and the materials are\r\nmixed to a homogeneous mass, which is ready to be taken to the street.\r\nIt should reach there at a temperature not less than 250°, and is\r\nspread with hot iron rakes so as to give usually a thickness of two\r\ninches after consolidation. After spreading, it is rolled with a hand\r\nroller, after which a small amount of hydraulic cement is swept over\r\nthe surface, and it is thoroughly rolled with a steam roller of not\r\nless than ten tons, the rolling to be continued as long as the roller\r\nmakes any impression on the surface.\r\n\r\nThe foundation is usually of cement concrete about six inches thick,\r\nthough asphalt pavements are often laid over old stone pavements.\r\nBetween the foundation and the wearing surface there is generally laid\r\nwhat is called a binder course, one inch thick and formed of small\r\nbroken stone, to which has been added asphaltic cement, the same as is\r\nused in making the wearing surface. Five or six pints of this cement\r\nare used to each cubic foot of stone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KING'S HIGHWAY, BROOKLYN; SIXTEEN FEET IN CENTER OF ROAD\r\nMACADAMIZED.]\r\n\r\nThe pavement just described is made from Trinidad asphalt, the material\r\nfrom which nearly all the earlier artificial asphalt pavements in this\r\ncountry were made, and which was used almost exclusively until within\r\nthe last half dozen years.\r\n\r\nWithin that time, however, it has been discovered that there are a\r\nnumber of other deposits of asphalt well adapted to use for street\r\npavements. A very large deposit containing a high percentage of bitumen\r\nand very little mineral matter is located near the coast in the State\r\nof Bermudez, in Venezuela. Large deposits have been found in several\r\nplaces in California, and in Utah, Kentucky, and Texas, and a number\r\nof other places. The Kentucky product is classed as a natural rock\r\nasphalt, as it is a sandstone impregnated with bitumen. It has been\r\nmixed with about an equal portion of German rock asphalt and used\r\nwith very satisfactory results in Buffalo. These asphalts are quite\r\ndifferent in their composition, and each requires somewhat different\r\ntreatment. The Bermudez, being richer in bitumen and softer, requires\r\nthe addition of very little flux. The California deposits furnish their\r\nown flux in a liquid asphalt or maltha, which is almost absolutely\r\npure bitumen, and the use of petroleum residuum is thereby avoided\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ASPHALT PAVEMENT ON CLINTON AVENUE, BROOKLYN.]\r\n\r\nIt has been recognized since 1836 that the bitumen which forms the\r\ngreater part of natural asphalts can be separated into two substances,\r\nwhich have been commonly known as petrolene and asphaltene, the former\r\nof which possesses the cementitious qualities essential to the making\r\nof a successful pavement. Instead of the arbitrary names--petrolene\r\nand asphaltene--these substances are sometimes more aptly designated\r\nas active and inert bitumen. It has been found that of the bitumen\r\nextracted from asphalts which have given the most satisfactory results\r\nin making street pavements, sixty-nine per cent or more is soluble in\r\npetroleum naphtha having a specific gravity of 72° Beaumé.\r\n\r\nAn asphalt pavement can not be economically kept in good condition\r\nunless every defect which may develop is immediately repaired. When\r\nthe smooth, hard surface is once broken, disintegration proceeds very\r\nrapidly, and a large hole is soon formed. The more general distribution\r\nof smooth pavements, however, will tend to distribute the traffic\r\nmore evenly, and the increasing use of rubber tires and rubber shoes\r\nfor horses, to say nothing of the probably quite general use of motor\r\nvehicles, within the next decade will result in the elimination of the\r\nforces at present most destructive to pavements.\r\n\r\nMuch regret is often expressed that asphalt pavements should be so\r\nfrequently opened for the purpose of laying or obtaining access to\r\nsubsurface pipes and conduits, and thereby mutilated. As a matter\r\nof fact, there is no pavement at present in use which can be so\r\neffectively and satisfactorily restored as asphalt. When skillfully\r\ndone, almost no trace of such an opening can be found.\r\n\r\nThe first question to arise, when it has been determined to pave a\r\nstreet, will be the selection of material, or the kind of pavement to\r\nbe laid. In determining this, the governing considerations will be the\r\ntraffic to be sustained, its density and character, the rate of grade,\r\nand the presence or absence of railroad tracks.\r\n\r\nIf the traffic be very heavy and the street given up wholly to\r\nbusiness, ease of traction, durability, and economy of maintenance are\r\nof first importance, while quiet, comfortable riding, and beauty can\r\nbe sacrificed to them. Many efforts have been made to determine the\r\nrelative force required to draw a load over different kinds of surface\r\nunder similar conditions. The following is from a table compiled by\r\nMr. Rudolph Hering, from different authorities, the force being that\r\nnecessary to move one ton on a level grade at a speed of three miles an\r\nhour:\r\n\r\n  KIND OF ROAD.

SMITH, LL. D.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the question of a criminal type, defined by certain marks of a\r\nphysical nature and emphasized by accompanying mental and moral\r\ncharacteristics, were confined to the technical speculations of a\r\nspecial craft of scientists, the public would have little interest in\r\nthe spread of the doctrines of Cesare Lombroso and his _confrères_ in\r\nthis country. When it is believed, however, that certain men and women\r\nare committed to prison or condemned to death not on account of crimes\r\nin any ethical sense, but because of spontaneous actions from vicious\r\nimpulses beyond their control, the subject affects the administration\r\nof law, the theory of punishment, and the safety of society.\r\n\r\nLombroso and the Italian school say that they have discovered a\r\ntype of man who is born a criminal, and who may be recognized by a\r\nMongolian face, abnormal features, ill-shaped ears, unsymmetrical\r\nskull, and various psychical peculiarities, which are the result of\r\nbad organization. This doctrine is illustrated by descriptions of\r\ncriminals who have the abnormalities, and in the hands of skillful\r\nwriters the case is made very plausible. The theory is in harmony\r\nwith so much popular modern thought, which loosely interprets the\r\ndoctrine of evolution by a crass materialism, that it has infected\r\nAmerican prison literature, while it has never misled those men to whom\r\npractical experience has given the most right to have an opinion on the\r\nsubject. The sense of personal responsibility is still the foundation\r\nof social order, and if in truth there is no such thing, the world is\r\nawake at last from its dream of morality; righteousness is resolved\r\ninto heredity, structure, and habit; living is a mere puppet show, and\r\nthe wreck of things impends. If Lombroso is right, modern scientific\r\nmethods are sure to prove him so, and we shall have at last sound\r\ntheories; but we shall have no world in which they can be used, for the\r\ndissolution predicted by Herbert Spencer will have come.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Group 1, No. 1.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Group 1, No. 2.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Group 1, No. 3.]\r\n\r\nExceptional opportunities for the study of the abnormal classes in\r\nthe institutions of this country and Europe have given me a personal\r\ninterest in the question of the criminal type. I have discovered that\r\nthe criminal anthropologists do not choose for comparison with the\r\nprison population their normal men from the ranks where the criminal\r\nclasses are recruited. Blackwell's Island has no more peculiar\r\ninmates than abound in sections of New York near the East River; the\r\nresidents of the Whitechapel district of London may be compared with\r\nthe inmates of Pentonville, to the distinct credit of the latter; and\r\nthe man in Roquette is no worse off in body than scores whom I have\r\nseen in certain localities south of the Seine. The fact is, no human\r\nbody exists which is not in some respects abnormal. The number of\r\nabnormalities and their extent depend upon a variety of circumstances,\r\namong which are food, climate, occupation, and the incidents of birth\r\nitself, as well as the various forms of infantile disease. I will\r\nundertake to find enough physical peculiarities, in any locality, or\r\namong the members of any profession, to establish any physical theory\r\nwhich may be propounded.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Group 2, No. 1 (forger).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Group 2, No. 2.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Group 2, No. 3.]\r\n\r\nIt occurred to me to try an experiment in a manner entirely different\r\nfrom the usual criminal researches. Having been very familiar with a\r\ncertain prison for many years, I requested the warden, who is a very\r\nable man in his profession, to send me the photographs of ten or a\r\ndozen men whom he regarded as the most representative criminals in his\r\npopulation of some five hundred persons. The warden was not informed of\r\nthe use I intended to make of the material, and supposed it was for\r\nillustration in university class work. Later, he gave me the Bertillon\r\nmeasurements of the men, with an epitome of their history. A number of\r\nthese men I have known for years. So far from this selection supporting\r\nthe modern theory of a criminal type, it confutes it in a conspicuous\r\nmanner. The abnormalities are slight, and there is as great a diversity\r\namong the men as could be asked. It must be remembered that these cases\r\nwere selected by a shrewd and competent official, solely upon their\r\ncriminal record, and not in the interests of any theory whatever.\r\n\r\nOf course, the men do not look well, but neither would any ordinary\r\ncompany of citizens if their heads were shaved and they were put in\r\nprison dress. I am always shocked by the changed appearance of the men\r\nafter the prison transformation. Young embezzlers of elegant figure,\r\nwho have moved in good society without a question, easily look the\r\nrascal behind prison walls.\r\n\r\nThe first group are murderers. No. 1 murdered his daughter because she\r\ninsisted upon going to a party against his wishes. He has the head of\r\na philosopher. It was his first crime. It may be noted that tattooing\r\nis supposed to be common among criminals. This man is tattooed, but\r\ncommitted no crime until fifty years of age, and was a deputy sheriff\r\nfor some years. No. 2 did not kill his victim, but the assault was\r\nmurderous, and the escape from death was accidental. It is difficult\r\nto discuss the negro in crime without entering into racial and social\r\nquestions beyond the present limits. No. 3 has a very good head, an\r\nexcellent ear, and, barring the expression, a pleasing face. He has a\r\nlife sentence for murder. He is the worst man in the prison. I have\r\nfor years believed him to be insane. His family is criminal. His\r\nfather murdered his mother in a brutal manner before the child's eyes,\r\nwhen No. 3 was only eight years old. He himself has committed several\r\ndesperate assaults, growing out of his persistent mania of persecution.\r\nNo. 3 is not morally responsible, and there are usually two or three\r\nsuch prisoners out of a thousand subjects.\r\n\r\nThe second group are very diverse in structure and temperament, but\r\nhave committed the same kind of crime. No. 1 is a confidence man and a\r\nforger. He is a crafty and an habitual criminal, has served terms in\r\nvarious prisons, is keen of intellect, well educated, has traveled in\r\nmany countries, and is a citizen of the world.\r\n\r\nNo. 2 is a confirmed forger, and has served several terms in prison\r\nfor the same offense. He is a skillful bookkeeper, has an attractive\r\nmanner, and as soon as he is out in the world secures employment and\r\nplans his next crime.\r\n\r\nNo. 3 is a counterfeiter. His head is small, but of excellent shape,\r\nand he has rather a refined physical organization. His criminal record\r\nis bad, and he has served at least one term before for the same\r\noffense. His imagination, temperament, and vices would select him as a\r\nperson who would be guilty of a very different and more fleshly kind\r\nof crime. The group is formed by the correlation of crime; they have\r\nnothing in common in physical organization.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Group 3, No. 1.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Group 3, No. 2.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Group 3, No. 3.]\r\n\r\nThe third group are thieves. No. 1 is a confirmed criminal, and has\r\nserved several terms in prison. He is the tallest man in the list.\r\nHis head is \"long\" and well formed, and his features are regular. His\r\nexpression indicates power of sustained thought, and his peculiar\r\nappearance is not due to his kind of crime, but to his habit of\r\nmind. He is a pessimist of the first rank, and hates the world, his\r\nfellow-men, and perhaps himself most of all. He will not work when at\r\nliberty, thinks that society is totally depraved, and that war upon it\r\nis the only proper mission in life. He is pre-eminently the antisocial\r\nman.\r\n\r\nNo. 2 is really a pleasing fellow. He is tender, sympathetic, and\r\npious. Under proper circumstances he might have made an admirable\r\nSunday-school superintendent. He is plausible, insinuating, and\r\nwinning. In temperament, feeling, and social habit he is the complete\r\nantithesis to No. 1. He is a most dangerous criminal, and has a black\r\nand varied record.\r\n\r\nNo. 3 is a man of lower grade of organization and habit, but he is a\r\ncriminal by profession. He is an idle and worthless vagabond, but he\r\nis an accomplished thief. He makes an excellent prisoner, obedient to\r\nthe rules, industrious, and seemingly anxious to improve. In fact, the\r\nprison furnishes his best environment, for it is only there that he is\r\nat peace with himself and his world.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Contrasts, No. 1.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Contrasts, No. 2.]\r\n\r\nThe last two men presented are contrasts. No. 1 is an accidental\r\ncriminal. His previous history and character give strong grounds for\r\nthe belief that, under pressure of want for the necessaries of life,\r\nhe was led astray by a man older and stronger than himself. It is not\r\nlikely that he would repeat his fault. No. 2, on the other hand, is a\r\nsexual pervert of the worst kind, whose case seems so hopeless that\r\nperpetual imprisonment is indicated as the only relief for him, and the\r\nonly safety for society. Apart from the expression of his eyes, caused\r\nby an irregular focus, there is nothing marked about the face. The head\r\nis of a pronounced \"broad\" type, but, on the other hand, he comes from\r\na province of Germany where that type is dominant.\r\n\r\nTo complete the experiment, I submitted these portraits to a number\r\nof gentlemen, and to no two of them at the same time, for their\r\nopinions of the cases. The informal committee represented the different\r\nprofessions which might be expected to fit men for observation, for\r\nthere was a lawyer, a physician, a railway president, a criminal judge,\r\nand a college professor. Each of them is eminent in his special field.\r\nThe committee was manifestly handicapped by the shorn head, the prison\r\ndress, and the lack of the accessories of masculine ornamentation, such\r\nas collars and cravats. The committee was asked to name the crimes,\r\nand to group the men according to their criminal record. Each opinion\r\ndiffered from the other, and all were wide of the mark. The shrewd\r\nlawyer thought the accidental criminal \"might be guilty of anything.\"\r\nIt was only the college professor, the last man of the company from\r\nwhom anything might properly be expected, who was able to select the\r\nworst two cases with the remark, \"These men are degenerates.\" But while\r\nthe committee was at work on the photographs the writer was at work on\r\nthe committee, and actually discovered more anomalies of organization\r\nin these distinguished citizens than are apparent in the criminals.\r\nAfter this remark it is necessary to withhold their names, though some\r\nof them are men of national reputation.\r\n\r\nIt is time to reassert with increasing emphasis the personal\r\nresponsibility of the individual, and to insist upon the enthronement\r\nand guidance of conscience. There are certainly social and economic\r\nreasons for crime, some of which the writer has pointed out elsewhere,\r\nbut the chief fact in human life is the power of self-determination.\r\nThe chief causes of crime, outside of personal and moral degradation,\r\nare psychical and not physical. The reader of history can not fail\r\nto have noted that relation of prevalent ideas to conduct which is\r\nso conspicuous in human affairs. The scenes of blood and desolation\r\ncharacteristic of the French Revolution are directly traceable to the\r\ndoctrines which prepared the way for anarchy, but not for rational\r\nfreedom.\r\n\r\nWe have had our attention directed to the contagion of suicide which\r\nhas marked the last half decade. But Lecky tells us that suicide was\r\nmade practically unknown in the civilized world by the spread of\r\nChristianity and its beliefs in the dignity and sanctity of man. The\r\npresent contagion will disappear not as the result of food, or raiment,\r\nor houses, or any other material good, but by a revival of practical\r\nfaith in the human soul and its capacity, in human righteousness and\r\nits obligation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA CENTURY OF GEOLOGY.\r\n\r\nBY PROF. JOSEPH LE CONTE.\r\n\r\n[_Concluded._]\r\n\r\nTHE AGE OF THE EARTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nUntil almost the beginning of the present century the general belief in\r\nall Christian countries was that not only the earth and man, but the\r\nwhole cosmos, began to exist about six thousand to seven thousand years\r\nago; furthermore, that all was made at once without natural process,\r\nand have remained substantially unchanged ever since. This is the old\r\ndoctrine of the supernatural origin and substantial permanency of the\r\nearth and its features. Among intelligent and especially scientific men\r\nthis doctrine, even in the eighteenth century, began to be questioned,\r\nalthough not publicly; for in 1751 Buffon was compelled by the Sorbonne\r\nto retract certain views concerning the age of the earth, published in\r\nhis Natural History in 1749.[1] Remnants of the old belief lingered\r\neven into the early part of the present century, and may even yet be\r\nfound hiding away in some of the remote corners of civilized countries.\r\nBut with the birth of geology, and especially through the work of\r\nHutton in Scotland, Cuvier in France, and William Smith in England,\r\nthe much greater--the inconceivably great--antiquity of the earth and\r\nthe origin of its present forms, by gradual changes which are still\r\ngoing on, was generally acknowledged. Indeed, as already said, this is\r\nthe fundamental idea of geology, without which it could not exist as a\r\nscience.\r\n\r\nGeology has its own measures of time--in eras, periods, epochs,\r\nages, etc.--but it is natural and right that we should desire more\r\naccurate estimates by familiar standards. How old, then, is the\r\nearth, especially the inhabited earth, in years? Geologists have\r\nattempted to answer this question by estimates based on the rates of\r\nsedimentation and erosion, or else on the rate of changes of organic\r\nforms by struggle for life and survival of the fittest. Physicists have\r\nattempted to answer the same question by calculations based on known\r\nlaws of dissipation of energy in a cooling body, such as the sun or the\r\nearth. The results of the two methods differ widely. The estimates of\r\nthe geologists are enormous, and growing ever greater as the conditions\r\nof the problem are better understood. Nothing less than several hundred\r\nmillion years will serve his purpose. The estimates of the physicists\r\nare much more moderate, and apparently growing less with each revision.\r\nThe latest results of King and Kelvin give only twenty to thirty\r\nmillions.[2] This the geologist declares is absurdly inadequate. He can\r\nnot work freely in so narrow a space--he has not elbow room.\r\n\r\nThe subject is still discussed very earnestly, but with little hope of\r\ndefinite conclusion. One thing, however, must be remarked. Both parties\r\nassume--the geologist tacitly, the physicist avowedly--the nebular\r\nhypothesis of the origin of the solar system, and therefore the early\r\nincandescent _fluid_ condition of the earth as the basis of all his\r\nreasonings. Now, while this is probably the most reasonable view, it is\r\nnot so certain that it can be made the basis of complex mathematical\r\ncalculation. There is a possible alternative theory--viz., the meteoric\r\ntheory--which is coming more and more into favor. According to this\r\nview, the planets may have been formed by aggregation of meteoric\r\nswarms, and the heat of the earth produced by the collision of the\r\nmeteors in the act of aggregation. According to the one view (the\r\nnebular), the heat is all primal, and the earth has been only losing\r\nheat all the time. According to the other, the aggregation and the\r\nheating are both gradual, and may have continued even since the earth\r\nwas inhabited. According to the one, the spendthrift earth wasted\r\nnearly all its energy before it became habitable or even a crust was\r\nformed, and therefore the habitable period must be comparatively short.\r\nAccording to the other, the cooling and the heating, the expenditure\r\nand the income, were going on at the same time, and therefore the\r\nprocess may have lasted much longer.\r\n\r\nThe subject is much too complex to be discussed here. Suffice it to\r\nsay that on this latter view not only the age of the earth, but many\r\nother fundamental problems of dynamical geology, would have to be\r\nrecalculated. The solution of these great questions must also be left\r\nto the next century. In the meantime we simply draw attention to two\r\nvery recent papers on the subject--viz., that of Lord Kelvin,[3] and\r\ncriticism of the same by Chamberlin.[4]\r\n\r\n\r\nANTIQUITY AND ORIGIN OF MAN.\r\n\r\nEven after the great antiquity of the earth and its origin and\r\ndevelopment by a natural process were generally accepted, still man\r\nwas believed, even by the most competent geologists, to have appeared\r\nonly a few thousand years ago. The change from this old view took\r\nplace in the last half of the present century--viz., about 1859--and,\r\ncoming almost simultaneously with the publication of Darwin's Origin of\r\nSpecies, prepared the scientific mind for entertaining, at least, the\r\nidea of man's origin by a natural process of evolution.\r\n\r\nEvidences of the work of man--flint implements, associated with the\r\nbones of extinct animals and therefore showing much greater age than\r\nusually accepted--had been reported from time to time, notably those\r\nfound in the river Somme by Boucher de Perthes. But the prejudice\r\nagainst such antiquity was so strong that geologists with one accord,\r\nand without examination, pooh-poohed all such evidence as incredible.\r\nIt was Sir Joseph Prestwich who, in 1859, first examined them\r\ncarefully, and published the proofs that convinced the geological world\r\nthat early man was indeed contemporaneous with the extinct animals of\r\nthe Quaternary period, and that the time must have been many times\r\ngreater than usually allowed.[5]\r\n\r\nSince that time confirmatory evidence has accumulated, and the earliest\r\nappearance of man has been pushed back first to the late glacial, then\r\nto the middle glacial, and finally, in Mr. Prestwich's Plateau Gravels,\r\nto the early glacial or possibly preglacial times.\r\n\r\nStill, however, in every case earliest man was unmistakably man. No\r\nlinks connecting him with other anthropoids had been found. Very\r\nrecently, however, have been found, by Du Bois, in Java, the skull,\r\nteeth, and thigh bone of what seems to be a veritable _missing_ link,\r\nnamed by the discoverer _Pithecanthropus erectus_. The only question\r\nthat seems to remain is whether it should be regarded as an ape\r\nmore manlike than any known ape, or a man more apelike than any yet\r\ndiscovered. The age of this creature was either latest Pliocene or\r\nearliest Quaternary.\r\n\r\n\r\nBREAKS IN THE GEOLOGICAL RECORD AND THEIR SIGNIFICANCE.\r\n\r\nFrom the earliest times of geologic study there have been observed\r\nunconformities of the strata and corresponding changes in the fossil\r\ncontents. Some of these unconformities are local and the changes of\r\norganic forms inconsiderable, but sometimes they are of wider extent\r\nand the changes of life system greater. In some cases the unconformity\r\nis universal or nearly so, and in such cases we find a complete\r\nand apparently sudden change in the fossil contents. It was these\r\nuniversal breaks that gave rise to the belief in the occurrence of\r\nviolent catastrophes and corresponding wholesale exterminations and\r\nre-creations of faunas and floras.\r\n\r\nIt is evident, however, on a little reflection, that every such\r\nunconformity indicates a land period at the place observed, and\r\ntherefore a time unrecorded in strata and fossils at that place--i.\r\ne., a lost interval--certain leaves missing from the book of time. And\r\nif the unconformity be widespread, the lost interval is correspondingly\r\ngreat. It is therefore probable that change of species went on slowly\r\nand uniformly all the time, although not recorded at that place.\r\nIntermediate strata may be and often are found elsewhere, and the\r\nsupposed lost interval filled. The record was continuous and the\r\nchanges uniform, but the record is not all found in one place. The\r\nleaves of the book of Time are scattered here and there, and it is the\r\nduty of the geologist to gather and arrange them in proper order, so\r\nthat the record may read continuously.\r\n\r\nThis is the uniformitarian view, and is undoubtedly far truer than\r\nthe catastrophic. But the objection to it is that in the case of very\r\nwidespread unconformities, such as occurred several times in the\r\nhistory of the earth, the changes of organisms are so great that if the\r\nrate of change was uniform the lost interval must have been equal to\r\nall the rest of the history put together. Therefore we are compelled\r\nto admit that in the history of the earth there have been periods of\r\ncomparative quiet (not fixedness) during which evolutionary changes\r\nwere slow and regular, and periods of revolution during which the\r\nchanges were much more rapid, but not catastrophic. This is exactly\r\nwhat we ought to expect on the idea of gradual evolution of earth\r\nforms by secular cooling, for in the gradual contraction of the earth\r\nthere must come times of general readjustment of the crust to the\r\nshrinking nucleus. These readjustments would cause great changes in\r\nphysical geography and climate, and corresponding rapid changes in\r\norganic forms. In addition to this, the changes in physical geography\r\nand climate would cause extensive migrations of species, and therefore\r\nminglings of faunas and floras, severer struggles of competing forms,\r\nand more rapid advance in the steps of evolution. Among these changes\r\nof organic forms there would arise and have arisen _new dominant\r\ntypes_, and these, in their turn, would compel new adjustment of\r\nrelations and still further hasten the steps of evolution. Such\r\nchanges, whether geographic, or climatic, or organic, would _not_\r\nbe simultaneous all over the earth, but propagated from place to\r\nplace, until quiet was re-established and a new period of comparative\r\nstability and prosperity commenced.\r\n\r\nThis view is a complete reconciliation of catastrophism and\r\nuniformitarianism, and is far more rational than either extreme.\r\n\r\n_Critical Periods in the History of the Earth._--Such periods of rapid\r\nchange may well be called _critical periods or revolutions_. They are\r\nmarked by several characteristics: (1) By widespread oscillations of\r\nthe earth's crust, and therefore by almost universal unconformities.\r\n(2) By widespread changes of physical geography, and therefore by\r\ngreat changes in climate. (3) By great and widespread changes in\r\norganic forms, produced partly by the physical changes and partly by\r\nthe extensive migrations. (4) By the evolution of new dominant types,\r\nwhich are also the cause of extensive changes in species. (5) Among the\r\nphysical changes occurring at these times is the formation of great\r\nmountain ranges. The names of these critical periods or revolutions are\r\noften taken from the mountain range which form their most conspicuous\r\nfeatures.\r\n\r\nThere have been at least four of these critical periods, or periods of\r\ngreatest change: (1) The pre-Cambrian or Laurentide revolution; (2)\r\nthe post-Paleozoic or Appalachian; (3) the post-Cretaceous or Rocky\r\nMountain; (4) the post-Tertiary or glacial revolution.\r\n\r\nNow, as these critical periods separate the primary divisions of\r\ntime--the eras--it follows that the _Present_--the Age of Man--is an\r\nera. It may be called the _Psychozoic Era_. These views have been\r\nmainly advocated by the writer of this sketch, but I believe that, with\r\nperhaps some modification in statement, they would be accepted by most\r\ngeologists as a permanent acquisition of science.[6]\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGICAL CLIMATES.\r\n\r\nAttention was first drawn to this subject by the apparently unique\r\nphenomena of the Glacial epoch.\r\n\r\nFor nearly a century past Alpine glaciers, their structure, their\r\nmysterious motion, and their characteristic erosive effects, have\r\nexcited the keenest interest of scientific men. But until about 1840\r\nthe interest was purely physical. It was Louis Agassiz who first\r\nrecognized ice as a great _geological agent_. He had long been familiar\r\nwith the characteristic marks of glacial action, and with the fact\r\nthat Alpine glaciers were far more extensive formerly than now, and\r\nhad, moreover, conceived the idea of a Glacial epoch--an ice age in\r\nthe history of the earth. With this idea in his mind, in 1840 he\r\nvisited England, and found the marks of glaciers all over the higher\r\nregions of England and Scotland. He boldly announced that the whole\r\nof northern Europe was once covered with a universal ice sheet. A few\r\nyears later he came to the United States, and found the tracks of\r\nglaciers everywhere, and again astonished the world by asserting that\r\nthe whole northern part of the North American continent was modeled\r\nby a moving ice sheet. This idea has been confirmed by all subsequent\r\ninvestigation, especially here in America.\r\n\r\nBut it would be strange, indeed, if the cold of the Glacial epoch\r\nshould be absolutely unique. Attention was soon called to similar marks\r\nin rocks of other geological periods, especially in the Permian of the\r\nsouthern hemisphere. This opened up the general question of _geological\r\nclimates and their causes_.\r\n\r\nPerhaps no subject connected with the physics of the earth is more\r\nobscure and difficult than this. The facts, as far as we know them,\r\nare briefly as follows: (1) All the evidence we have point to a\r\nhigh, even an ultra-tropical, climate in early geological times;\r\n(2) all the evidence points to a uniform distribution of this early\r\nhigh temperature, so that the zonal arrangement of temperatures,\r\nsuch as characterizes present climates, did not then exist; (3)\r\ntemperature zones were apparently first introduced in the late Mesozoic\r\n(Cretaceous) or early Tertiary times, and during the Tertiary the\r\ncolder zones were successively added, until at the end there was formed\r\na polar ice-cap as now.\r\n\r\nThus far all might be explained by progressive cooling of the earth\r\nand progressive clearing of the atmosphere of its excess CO_[2] and\r\naqueous vapor. But (4) from time to time (i. e., at critical periods)\r\nthere occurred great oscillations of temperature, the last and probably\r\nthe greatest of these being the Glacial period. The cause of these\r\ngreat oscillations of temperature, and especially the cause of the\r\nglacial climate, is one of the most interesting and yet one of the\r\nobscurest and therefore one of most hotly disputed points in geology.\r\nIndeed, the subject has entered into the region of almost profitless\r\ndiscussion. We must wait for further light and for another century.\r\nOnly one remark seems called for here. It is in accordance with a true\r\nscientific method that we should exhaust terrestrial causes before we\r\nresort to cosmical. The most usual terrestrial cause invoked is the\r\noscillation of the earth's crust. But recently Chamberlin, in a most\r\nsuggestive paper,[7] has invoked oscillations in the composition of the\r\natmosphere, especially in its proportion of CO_[2], as the _immediate_\r\ncause, although this in turn is due to oscillations of the earth's\r\ncrust.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NEW GEOLOGY.\r\n\r\nHeretofore the geological history of the earth has been studied only\r\nin the record of stratified rocks and their contained fossils. But in\r\nevery place there have been land-periods in which, of course, erosion\r\ntook the place of sedimentation. This kind of record is very imperfect,\r\nbecause there are no fossils. Until recently no account was taken of\r\nthese erosion-periods except as breaks of indefinite length in the\r\nrecord--as lost intervals. But now, and mainly through the work of\r\nAmerican geologists, interpretation of these erosion-periods has fairly\r\ncommenced, and so important has this new departure in the study of\r\ngeology seemed to some that it has been hailed as a new era in geology,\r\nconnecting it more closely with geography. Heretofore _former_ land\r\nperiods were recognized by unconformities and the amount of time by\r\nthe degree of change in the fossils, but now the amount of time is\r\nestimated in _existing_ land surfaces by topographic _forms_ alone.\r\nThis idea was introduced into geology by Major J. W. Powell, and has\r\nbeen applied with success by William Morris Davis, W. J. McGee, and\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nThe principle is this: Land surface subject to erosion and standing\r\nstill is finally cut down to gently sweeping curves, with low, rounded\r\ndivides and broad, shallow troughs. Such a surface is called by Davis\r\na Peneplain. Such a peneplain is characteristic of old topography.\r\nIf such a surface be again lifted to higher level, the rivers again\r\ndissect it by ravines, which are deep and narrow in proportion to the\r\namount and rate of the uplift. If the land again remains steady, the\r\nsharply dissected surface is again slowly smoothed out to the gentle\r\ncurves of a peneplain. If, on the contrary, the surface be depressed,\r\nthe rivers fill up the channels with sediment which, on re-elevation,\r\nis again dissected. Thus the whole _ontogeny_ of land surfaces have\r\nbeen studied out, so that their age may be recognized at sight.\r\n\r\nThus, while heretofore the more recent movements of the crust were\r\nsupposed to be readable only on coast lines and by means of the old\r\nsea strands, now we read with equal ease the movements of the interior\r\nby means of the physiognomy of the topography, and especially the\r\nstructure of the river channels. Moreover, while heretofore the history\r\nof the earth was supposed to be recorded only in stratified rock and\r\ntheir contained fossils, now we find that recent history is recorded\r\nand may be read also in the general topography of the land surfaces.\r\nGeography is studied no longer as mere description of earth forms, but\r\nalso as to the causes of these forms, no longer as to present forms,\r\nbut also as to the history of their becoming. Thus geography, by its\r\nalliance with geology, has become a truly scientific study, and as\r\nsuch is now introduced into the colleges and universities. It is this\r\nalliance with geology which has caused the dry bones of geographic\r\nfacts to live. It is this which has created a soul under the dry \"_ribs\r\nof this death_.\" This mode of study of the history of the earth has\r\njust commenced. How much will come of it is yet to be shown in the next\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nIn this connection it is interesting to trace the effect of environment\r\non geological reasonings in different countries. Heretofore, especially\r\nin England, what we have called peneplains were usually attributed to\r\nmarine denudation--i. e., to cutting back of a coast line by constant\r\naction of the waves, leaving behind a level submarine plateau, which\r\nis afterward raised above sea level and dissected by rivers. American\r\ngeologists, on the contrary, are apt to regard such level surfaces as\r\nthe final result of aërial degradation or a base level of rain and\r\nriver erosion. The same difference is seen in the interpretation of\r\nglacial phenomena. Until recently, English geologists were inclined\r\nto attribute more to iceberg, Americans more to land ice. Again, in\r\nEngland coast scenery is apt to be attributed mainly to the ravages\r\nof the sea, while in America we attribute more to land erosion\r\ncombined with subsidence of the coast line. In a word, in the tight\r\nlittle sea-girt island of Great Britain, where the ravages of the\r\nsea are yearly making such serious inroads upon the area of the\r\nland, it is natural that the power of the sea should strongly affect\r\nthe imagination and impress itself on geological theories, and tend\r\nperhaps to exaggeration of sea agencies, while the broad features\r\nof the American continent and the evidences of prodigious erosion\r\nin comparatively recent geological time tend to the exaggeration of\r\nerosive agency of rain and rivers. These two must be duly weighed and\r\neach given its right proportion in the work of earth sculpture.\r\n\r\n\r\nPALEONTOLOGY.\r\n\r\nPaleontology at first attracted attention mainly by the new and strange\r\nlife forms which it revealed. It is the interest of a zoölogical\r\ngarden. This interest is of course perennial, but can hardly be called\r\nscientific. Geology at first was a kind of wonder book.\r\n\r\nNext fossils, especially marine shells, were studied as characteristic\r\nforms denoting strata of a particular age. They were coins by which we\r\nidentify certain periods of history. They were \"medals of creation.\"\r\nIt was in this way chiefly that William Smith, the founder of English\r\nstratigraphic geology, used them. It was in this way that Lyell and\r\nall the older geologists, until the advent of evolution, were chiefly\r\ninterested in them.\r\n\r\nIt was Cuvier, the great zoölogist and comparative anatomist, who, in\r\nthe beginning of the present century, first studied fossils, especially\r\nmammalian fossils, from the _zoölogical_ point of view--i. e., as\r\nto their affinities with existing animals. Cuvier's studies of the\r\nvertebrates of the Paris basin may be said to have laid the foundation\r\nof scientific paleontology from this point of view.\r\n\r\nThenceforward two views of paleontology and two modes of study\r\ngradually differentiated from one another, the one zoölogical, the\r\nother geological. In the one case we study fossils in _taxonomic_\r\ngroups--i. e., as species, genera, families, orders, etc.--and trace\r\nthe gradual evolution of each of these from generalized forms to their\r\nspecialized outcomes, completing as far as possible the genetic chain\r\nthrough all time. In the other we study fossils in _faunal groups_,\r\nas successive geological faunas, and the geographic diversity in\r\neach geological period--i. e., the evolution of geologic faunas and\r\nthe causes of geographic diversity in each. In a word, we study the\r\nlaws of distribution of faunas in time geologically and in space\r\ngeographically, and the causes of these laws in each case. The first\r\nis strictly a branch of zoölogy and botany, and we leave it to these\r\nspecialists. The second alone belongs properly to geology. In this\r\npurely geologic paleontology, as seen from its scope given above, there\r\nare many questions of widest philosophical interest which are only now\r\nattracting the attention they deserve. I only touch lightly two which\r\nhave been brought forward in these very last years of the century.\r\n\r\nI. GENERAL LAWS OF FAUNAL EVOLUTION.--The evolution of the organic\r\nkingdom from this strictly geological point of view may be briefly\r\nformulated as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Throughout all geological time there has been a general movement\r\nupward and onward, as it were abreast, everywhere. If this were all,\r\nthere would be only geological progress, but no geographical diversity.\r\nGeological history would be the same everywhere. A time horizon would\r\nbe easily determined by identity of fossil species. This we know is not\r\ntrue. Therefore there are other elements besides this.\r\n\r\n2. In different countries, isolated from one another and under\r\ndifferent conditions, evolution takes different _directions_ and\r\ndifferent _rates_, producing geographical diversity in each geological\r\nperiod. This diversity increases with time as long as the isolation\r\ncontinues. If this were all, the geographical diversity by continued\r\ndivergence would have become so great that it would be impossible even\r\napproximately to determine any geological horizon. The history of each\r\ncountry must be studied for itself. A general history of the earth\r\nwould be impossible. But this also is not true. There is therefore\r\nstill another element.\r\n\r\n3. From time to time, at long intervals--i. e., _critical\r\nperiods_--there are widespread readjustments of the crust to internal\r\nstrain, determining changes of physical geography and of climate,\r\nand therefore wide migrations of species with mingling and conflict\r\nof faunas. This would produce more rapid movement of evolution, but\r\nat the same time more or less complete obliteration of geographical\r\ndiversity.\r\n\r\n4. After these periods of migrations and minglings there would be\r\nre-isolations in new localities, and the process of diversification\r\nwould recommence and increase as long as the isolation continues.\r\n\r\nThe last of these critical periods of migrations and minglings and\r\nstruggles for life among competing species was the _Glacial epoch_ or\r\nice age. Therefore the present geographical distribution of species was\r\nlargely determined by the extensive migrations of that time.\r\n\r\nII. COSMOPOLITAN AND PROVINCIAL FAUNAS.--There are apparently in the\r\nhistory of the earth periods of widespread or cosmopolitan faunas,\r\nalternating with localized or provincial faunas. The cosmopolitan\r\nperiods are usually times of prevalence of limestones or organic\r\nsediments, and the fossils are very abundant. The provincial periods\r\nare usually characterized by sandstones and shales or mechanical\r\nsediments, and are comparatively poor in fossils. Moreover, it\r\nis believed that the cosmopolitan limestone periods are oceanic\r\nperiods--i. e., periods of wide oceans and lower and smaller continents\r\nand little erosive activity, while the sandstone periods, characterized\r\nby provincial faunas, are periods of higher and larger continents, and\r\ntherefore of great erosion and abundant mechanical sedimentation.\r\n\r\nNow, according to Chamberlin, these remarkable alternations are due\r\nto oscillations of the crust, in which the continents are alternately\r\nlifted and depressed. It must be remembered that abyssal faunas\r\nare almost unknown among fossils. This is the necessary result of\r\nsubstantial permanency of oceanic basins. The whole geological record\r\nis in shallow-water faunas. These shallow waters are along continental\r\nshore lines and in interior continental seas. According to Chamberlin\r\nagain, during a period of continental depression all the flat\r\ncontinental margins are submerged, forming broad submarine platforms,\r\nand the lower interior portions of the continents are also submerged,\r\nforming wide and shallow interior seas. Under these conditions\r\ncontinental waste, and therefore sand and clay sediments, are reduced\r\nto a minimum. Life, animal and vegetal, abounds, and therefore much\r\nlimestone is formed. The oceans are widely connected with one another,\r\nand therefore the faunas are widespread or cosmopolitan. During the\r\nperiod of elevation, on the contrary, the continents are extended to\r\nthe margin of the deep oceanic basins, the broad, shallow submarine\r\nplatforms are abolished, the interior seas are also abolished, the\r\nshallow-water areas are reduced to isolated bays, and their faunas are\r\npeculiar or provincial. Also, elevated and enlarged continents give\r\nrise to maximum erosion, and therefore abundant sediments of sandstone\r\nand clay, and comparative poverty of life and therefore of limestone.\r\nChamberlin also gives reasons why the oceanic periods should be warm,\r\nhumid, equable in temperature, and the atmosphere highly charged\r\nwith CO_[2], and therefore highly favorable to abundant life, both\r\nvegetal and animal, while land periods would be drier and cooler, the\r\natmosphere deficient in CO_[2], and therefore cold from that cause and\r\nin many ways unfavorable to abundant life.\r\n\r\nThese extremely interesting views, however, must be regarded as still\r\non trial, as a provisional hypothesis to be sifted, confirmed, or\r\nrejected, or in any case modified, in the next century.\r\n\r\nLastly, it is interesting to note the ever-increasing part taken by\r\nAmerican geologists in the advance of this science. There has been\r\nthrough the century a gradual movement of what might be called the\r\ncenter of gravity of geological research westward, until now, at its\r\nend, the most productive activity is here in America. This is not due\r\nto any superiority of American geologists, but to the superiority of\r\ntheir opportunities. Dana has well said that _America is the type\r\ncontinent of the world_. All geological problems are expressed here\r\nwith a clearness and a simplicity not found elsewhere. We must add to\r\nthis the comparative recency of geological study in this rich field. In\r\nEurope the simpler and broader problems are already worked out, and all\r\nthat remain are difficult problems requiring much time. In America, on\r\nthe contrary, not only are all problems expressed in simpler terms, but\r\nmany great and broad problems are still awaiting solution. For these\r\nreasons the greatest activity in research, and the most rapid advance\r\nduring the next century, will probably be here in America.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"SALAMANDERS\" AND \"SALAMANDER\" CATS.\r\n\r\nBY NORMAN ROBINSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn many places in the extreme Southern States, especially in what is\r\nlocally known as the \"piney woods,\" one of the most notable features\r\nis the constantly recurring mounds of yellow sand which everywhere dot\r\nand, it must be confessed, disfigure the monotonous landscape. These\r\npiles of earth are usually nearly circular in form, fairly symmetrical\r\nin contour, from six inches to two feet in diameter, and, save where\r\nthey have been beaten down by rain or winds or the trampling of cattle,\r\nabout half as high as they are broad. Often these sand heaps are\r\npretty evenly distributed, sometimes so thickly as to cover at least\r\none fourth of the soil surface. If you ask a native the cause of\r\nthis singular phenomenon, which you will perhaps at first be disposed\r\nto consider a kind of arenaceous eruption which has somehow broken\r\nout on the face of Nature, your informant will sententiously reply,\r\n\"Salamanders!\"\r\n\r\nAll this disfigurement is indeed the work of a curious little rodent\r\npopularly so named and about the size and color of an ordinary rat.\r\nHe is never seen above ground if he can possibly help it. He digs\r\ninnumerable branching underground tunnels at depths varying from one to\r\nsix feet, and these mounds of sand are simply the \"dump heaps\" which,\r\nin his engineering operations, he finds it necessary to make.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"SNAP-SHOT\" VIEW OF A LIVE \"SALAMANDER.\"]\r\n\r\nAfter carrying the excavated earth to the surface this cautious little\r\nminer takes the greatest pains to cover up his tracks. No opening into\r\nhis burrow is left. How he manages to so carefully smooth over his\r\nlittle sand mound and then literally \"pull the hole in after him\" is\r\nas yet unexplained. The work is mostly done at night, when observation\r\nis especially difficult. Sometimes, when he is a little belated and\r\nthe early morning twilight admonishes him that it is \"quitting time,\"\r\nhe gets in a hurry and slights his work. Then a little depression at\r\nthe top of the mound tells where he has made a hasty exit. Ordinarily\r\nthe rounding out of the sand pile is as deftly done as though it had\r\nall been managed from above. Indeed, the feat actually accomplished by\r\nthis little underground builder appears more puzzling the more it is\r\nconsidered. The most skilled human engineer would confess his inability\r\nto thus pile up a mound of loose sand, go down through it, leave\r\nthe top perfectly smoothed over, and, with no supports save the sand\r\nitself, to so fill up the passageway above him as he went down that not\r\nthe slightest mark should be left to indicate his pathway of retreat.\r\n\r\nEven if you dig into and under one of these sand mounds you will find\r\nvery little to betray the builder's whereabouts. It is seemingly all\r\nsolid earth, and unless you know exactly when and where and how to\r\ndig you will probably give up the search in disgust, with your labor\r\nand your backache but no \"salamander\" hole for your pains. Indeed,\r\nthe cunning of this little rodent in hiding his burrow is quite as\r\nconspicuous as his skill in digging it. \"Strategy\" is his strong\r\npoint. If by any chance you come upon his burrow it is probably an old\r\nabandoned one that is closed up and leads nowhere. The chances are ten\r\nto one that his real burrow is rods if not furlongs away.\r\n\r\nProvided you can find the last mound he has built and not more than\r\nfour or five hours have elapsed since its completion, by digging\r\ndiagonally to the right or left, at the distance of a foot or so, you\r\nwill have a fair chance of encountering his burrow. He is probably near\r\nby, resting from the severe labors of the previous night. If you give\r\nhim time to get his nap out and finish his job, your wiser plan will be\r\nto stop hunting and digging a little before you begin.\r\n\r\nWhy this little underground dweller should be called \"salamander\" is\r\none of those mysteries of popular nomenclature which is seemingly\r\ninexplicable. There is certainly nothing in the habits or appearance of\r\nthe animal to suggest the fabled fireproof batrachian. Like some other\r\nlovers of darkness, he has quite a number of _aliases_ by which in\r\nvarious portions of the South and West he is known. \"Gopher,\" \"pouched\r\nrat,\" \"hamster,\" and \"muelos\" are some of the titles by which he is\r\nlocally known. \"Salamander\" appears to be the most generally accepted\r\none.\r\n\r\nThis enterprising little rodent belongs to an ancient if not honorable\r\nfamily. By naturalists he is generally known as \"pocket gopher,\" and\r\nis classed among the _Geomyidæ_. Some fifteen known species have\r\nbeen recognized, with possibly more to hear from, and with a habitat\r\nextending quite across the continent. The Florida species is probably\r\n_Geomys tuza_ (Ord.), and though not as large as one or two others, is\r\nquite the peer of any of his cousins in enterprise and ability to look\r\nout for himself.\r\n\r\nThe illustration given is from what is probably the only photograph of\r\na living \"salamander\" ever taken. Mr. Geomys is not a model \"sitter.\"\r\nNo unwilling candidate for the \"rogues' gallery\" has more decided\r\nviews on the subject of having his picture taken. In a general way,\r\nit may be said that he doesn't pose for anybody. Precisely how this\r\nprejudice was finally overcome it is needless to state. Perseverance\r\nand \"snap shots\" were too much for our recalcitrant rodent. In the\r\nmatter of \"looking pleasant\" it must be conceded that Mr. Geomys was a\r\nlittle intractable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"DUMP HEAPS\" OF THE \"SALAMANDER.\"]\r\n\r\nThe fore legs and feet of the \"salamander\" are worth studying. They\r\nremind one somewhat of those of the mole, but are more stoutly built,\r\nwith much longer claws, and are evidently designed for harder tasks.\r\nThey are controlled by powerful brachial and pectoral muscles, and,\r\nas we shall see, are not only special tools adapted to special and\r\ndifficult work, but work which requires an enormous expenditure of\r\nphysical force.\r\n\r\nThe engineering problems which this little troglodyte has to solve are\r\nfar and away ahead of any that the New York Rapid-Transit Commission\r\nhas to deal with. It is very much as though a single miner were placed\r\nover in Hoboken, a hundred feet below the surface, with instructions to\r\ntunnel under the Hudson River with no tools except his hands, without\r\na chance of seeing daylight until he reached it on the New York side,\r\nand with the added conditions that all the excavated earth should be\r\ncarried out at the eastern opening of the tunnel, and finally that he\r\nshould obliterate all marks of his work and, as he retreated into his\r\ntunnel, pack the exit shaft above him so tightly and so deftly that it\r\nis impossible to trace its course!\r\n\r\nHow our little fur-coated engineer solves all these problems is as\r\nyet a mystery. We only know that he does it. He has a steam engine in\r\nhis shoulders and shovels for hands, but his exact methods of using\r\nthem is as yet largely a matter of conjecture. Only two plans of\r\noperation would seem to be possible. One would be for the \"salamander\"\r\nto first carry the excavated earth all to the rear into some portion\r\nof his already finished tunnel, and finally, when the outward exit is\r\ncompleted, to carry it back again and deposit it on the surface. This,\r\nof course, involves a double transfer of all the earth removed. It is\r\nmore likely that the \"salamander\" first forces a narrow passageway\r\nalong the line of his future tunnel in a way similar to that pursued\r\nby the mole. The latter animal has the advantage of working near\r\nthe surface, and the earth always yields along the line of least\r\nresistance, which of course is upward. Four or five feet down there\r\nis no such line, and the amount of force required to push the ground\r\naside must be something enormous. When the \"salamander\" comes to the\r\nupper air the work of excavation and enlargement begins. He then piles\r\nupon the surface all the earth that he can not use in obliterating his\r\nupward passageway. As the writer has frequently observed fresh sand\r\nmounds hundreds of feet from any others, he is inclined to believe that\r\nthis is the real method pursued.\r\n\r\nThe exceeding care which the \"salamander\" takes to leave no opening\r\ninto his subterranean home arises, no doubt, from his horror of snakes.\r\nIn this respect no woman can surpass him. His antipathies to reptiles\r\nare probably the accumulated embodiment of hundreds of centuries of\r\nancestral experience. He is aware that these hereditary enemies of his\r\nrace are of a very investigating turn of mind, and put in a good deal\r\nof spare time when awake in crawling into and exploring any tempting\r\nhole they may discover. And so Mr. Geomys, like the sensible fellow\r\nthat he is, not only takes good care to shut and lock his front gate\r\nevery time he is compelled to go through it, but he blocks up the whole\r\npassageway and does his best to convince trespassers that it is all a\r\nmistake to suppose that there ever has been any roadway leading to his\r\nunderground home.\r\n\r\nIndeed, it is by taking advantage of this morbid antipathy to intruders\r\nand daylight that our little underground dweller is usually caught. If\r\nby skillful digging a recently formed burrow is reached, one may be\r\nreasonably certain that in from five to ten minutes Mr. \"Salamander\"\r\nwill be on hand to see what has happened and to repair damages. A\r\nshotgun kept steadily aimed at the opening, and with a quick pull on\r\nthe trigger the instant the slightest movement in the sand is seen,\r\n\"fetches\" him every time. Another very successful method is to place\r\na strong trap right at the opening into his burrow. In making repairs\r\nour \"salamander\" is in too big a hurry to look very carefully where he\r\nsteps, and so is quite likely to blunder into the trap. He is always\r\ncaught, however, by one of his legs, and if left any length of time\r\nis quite apt to gnaw off the captive limb and thus make his escape.\r\nSpartan bravery or love of freedom surpassing this would be hard to\r\nfind.\r\n\r\nThe food of _Geomys bursarius_ appears to be exclusively vegetable.\r\nNative roots and root stocks, cones and bulbs, together with the root\r\nbark of various trees, are eaten by him, and sometimes in a very\r\nannoying way. Orange trees are peculiarly liable to his attacks. He\r\ngnaws through and around the tap root as near to the surface as he can\r\nwithout disturbing it or in any way calling attention to his work, and\r\nnot infrequently he continues his depredations until every root of any\r\nsize is eaten off. This, of course, means the death of the tree.\r\n\r\nFrom the \"salamander\" point of view, however, the greatest food\r\n\"bonanza\" of all is a sweet-potato patch. \"A 'possum up a 'simmon\r\ntree\" or a \"pig in clover\" is not more alive to the delights and\r\nadvantages of the situation. He not only eats all he can stuff, but\r\ninvites his relatives and friends. Nor is this all. He has learned\r\nthat in autumn sweet potatoes are liable to suddenly disappear, so he\r\n\"takes time\"--and the potatoes--\"by the forelock,\" and packs them away\r\nin liberal measure in his burrow for winter use. So well understood\r\nare the ways and weaknesses of this underground marauder that any\r\nsuspicious mound of earth in a sweet-potato field is the signal for an\r\nactive campaign of extermination, which ends only in the intruder's\r\nflight or death.\r\n\r\nThe \"side pockets\" of the \"salamander\" have already been referred to.\r\nThey are undoubtedly a great convenience to their owner in carrying\r\nfood and possibly other things. The capacity of these cheek pouches is\r\nabout sufficient to give room for a pigeon's egg. They are, however,\r\nquite extensile, and can readily be made to hold three or four times\r\nthis amount. Indeed, the skin and underlying connective tissue are so\r\nelastic that these pockets can readily be turned inside out. It is\r\nclaimed that the \"salamander\" employs his handlike fore feet to fill\r\nand empty these receptacles, using the right foot for the left pouch,\r\nand _vice versa_. A gentleman in Florida recently assured me that by a\r\nlucky thrust of a spade he once killed one of these mischievous rodents\r\nas he was in the very act of cutting off the roots of an orange tree.\r\nThe cheek pouches of the culprit were filled with fragments of bark\r\nwhich he had gnawed off, doubtless to be stowed away in his burrow.\r\n\r\nWhy, in a climate where there is almost no winter, where there is\r\nvery little interruption to vegetable growth and the food supply\r\nis practically unlimited, provisions should thus be stored away is\r\nsomewhat difficult to explain. It is not impossible that it is simply\r\nthe survival of an ancestral habit acquired during the Glacial period.\r\nOr it may be that, like the dog, the \"salamander\" finds the flavor\r\nof old and well-seasoned food more to his taste. All that can be\r\npositively affirmed is that this wise little rodent does, occasionally\r\nat least, thus _caché_ his food supplies.\r\n\r\nOne of the most curious results of the existence and habits of this\r\nelusive little burrowing rodent is the development of a new and\r\npeculiar breed of _Felis domestica_, called \"salamander\" cats. Ordinary\r\ntabbys do not understand or admire the ways of _Geomys bursarius_,\r\nor, for some other good and sufficient feline reason, do not include\r\nhim in their game list. The variety of cats in question, which, so\r\nfar as the author knows, is confined to Florida, appears to have been\r\ndeveloped spontaneously and with very little if any human agency, and\r\nis noted for its special skill in catching \"salamanders,\" as well as a\r\ndecided liking for the sport. Any Mrs. Tabby of this breed, especially\r\nif she has a family to provide for, is up betimes in the morning. The\r\nparticular object of her pursuit is a remarkably early riser, and\r\nfinishes his day's work before most people have begun theirs. So if\r\nthere is a convenient fence around the grounds she proposes to hunt\r\nshe mounts it with the first peep of day, and, with a sharp eye to\r\nlandward, starts on her tour of observation. Any fresh pile of sand\r\nis closely scrutinized. The slightest movement there brings her to\r\nthe mound with a spring, and she is at once crouching behind it; so\r\nwhen Mr. Geomys comes up in a big hurry with his next load of sand he\r\nfinds somebody to meet him that is in a bigger hurry still, and so the\r\nunsuspecting victim is borne off in triumph.\r\n\r\nAn estimable lady of the writer's acquaintance who owned one of these\r\n\"salamander\" cats, with a single juvenile pussy to provide for, kept\r\nan accurate account of the number of these rodents which she saw this\r\nindustrious mother cat bring to her offspring in a single month. The\r\nnumber was thirty, and as the month happened to be February this gave,\r\nof course, two more than a \"salamander\" a day.\r\n\r\nOne other curious observed feature of this new variety of cats is their\r\nwant of fecundity. The mother tabby seldom has more than one kitten\r\nat a birth. The writer once owned a fine female of this breed that\r\nscrupulously adhered to the traditional habits of her race.\r\n\r\nThis particular pussy, like the rest of us, had her family troubles.\r\nHer one kitten--probably from its mixed parentage--was always inclined\r\nto rebel at the \"salamander\" diet. There was something amusing to a\r\ndegree and suggestively human in the old cat's methods of discipline.\r\nWhen she had succeeded in catching a salamander she would always first\r\nbring it and lay it down before her mistress, to make sure of the\r\npraise and the petting. Then, with a motherly \"_meow_,\" she would call\r\nher kitten. That frisky little youngster was always quite ready for his\r\nbreakfast, but showed a decided preference for the \"maternal font.\"\r\nThen the old cat would give him a \"cuff\" that would send him spinning.\r\nThen she would take up the \"salamander\" and put it down before her\r\nhopeful offspring with an air that said as plainly as words could do:\r\n\"There, now! Eat that or go hungry!\" Then her mother love would get the\r\nbetter of her and she would go to licking and petting her disobedient\r\nbaby, and it would usually end in the kitten's having its own way\r\nand satisfying its hunger with milk from the \"original package.\" By\r\npersistence and the force of example the old cat finally succeeded in\r\naccustoming her offspring to what she evidently thought the orthodox\r\ndiet of her race.\r\n\r\nThe writer is quite well aware of the intrinsic difficulties involved\r\nin the spontaneous development of any new variety of cats. Still, such\r\nbranching of types has occurred in the past, and of course is possible\r\nnow. When his attention was first called to the matter he was inclined\r\nto consider it merely an instance of animal education. A fact that came\r\nunder his personal observation seems, however, hard to reconcile with\r\nthis or any theory that does not concede the hereditary transmission of\r\nacquired habits and tastes.\r\n\r\nA kitten of the breed of cats in question was taken when very young and\r\nreared nearly a mile away from its mother. When grown it developed the\r\nsame skill in hunting \"salamanders,\" and the same love for the sport as\r\nthat for which its mother was celebrated.\r\n\r\nDogs, of course, have long been noted for the readiness with which\r\nacquired knowledge, habits, and tastes manifest and perpetuate\r\nthemselves in hereditary forms. The setter, pointer, collie, St.\r\nBernard, and other well-known breeds will occur to everyone as\r\nillustrating this psychic plasticity. Doubtless the cat brain is\r\nsomewhat less impressible, but there would seem to be good reasons for\r\nincluding it among the educably variable types.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT MAKES THE TROLLEY CAR GO.\r\n\r\nBY WILLIAM BAXTER, JR., C. E.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nNOTE.--Figs. 28 and 32 are reproductions of photographs kindly\r\nfurnished by the General Electric Company, while for the view of car,\r\nFig. 30, we are indebted to Colonel N. H. Heft, chief electrical\r\nengineer of the New York, New Haven, and Hartford Railroad.\r\n\r\nAlthough the electric railway has been introduced throughout the\r\ncivilized world with the most remarkable rapidity, replacing cable as\r\nwell as horse roads, there has always been a strong opposition to the\r\nuse of the overhead trolley, and in some places, as, for instance, the\r\ncity of New York, this opposition has been so strong as to prevent the\r\nintroduction of the system until some other means of conveying the\r\ncurrent to the moving cars was devised. Many attempts have been made\r\nto solve this problem, and the patents taken out on such devices can\r\nbe numbered by the hundred and possibly by the thousand. Inventors\r\nin this field, however, have not met with all the encouragement they\r\ncould desire, owing to the fact that, notwithstanding opposition, the\r\noverhead trolley has been permitted in all but about three or four of\r\nthe larger cities of this country, and the greater portion of those\r\nof other countries. The principal well-founded objection that can be\r\nraised against the trolley is that it is unsightly and destroys the\r\nappearance of the street, but those who are opposed to it also claim\r\nthat it is dangerous, and that underground or surface systems would not\r\nbe. As a matter of fact it is not dangerous, and there is nothing on\r\nrecord to show that it is. Many persons have been run over by trolley\r\ncars, but this is no fault of the overhead trolley; it is due to the\r\nfact that street railroads are permitted to run cars through crowded\r\nstreets at a speed that is too great for safety. Underground conduit\r\ncars running at the same speed would run over just as many people. In\r\naccusing the trolley of being dangerous it is sought to prove that\r\nthe current flowing in the wire can do harm; but the history of the\r\nnumerous roads in existence shows that, so far as human beings are\r\nconcerned, the trolley current is not fatal, although it can give a\r\ndecidedly unpleasant shock, such as one would not care to experience\r\nthe second time. There is just as great, if not greater, liability\r\nof obtaining shocks from underground systems as from the trolley,\r\ntherefore the only real gain that can be made by their use is in the\r\nartistic sense. From a financial point of view no underground system\r\nso far devised can compare with the overhead trolley; but if any one\r\nshould devise anything hereafter that can be constructed at the same\r\nexpense and will not cost more for maintenance it will undoubtedly find\r\nan extensive application. Until such a perfect solution of the problem\r\nmakes its appearance the field for these devices will be confined to\r\ncities like New York and Washington, where the overhead trolley is not\r\npermitted.\r\n\r\nEvery system of conductors that dispenses with the overhead wire is\r\ncalled by the layman an underground trolley, but, properly speaking,\r\nthese systems may be divided into surface and subsurface conductors.\r\nBoth of these may again be divided into exposed and inclosed\r\nconductors, and also into continuous and sectional conductors. Finally,\r\nwe may designate the various modifications as mechanical, electrical,\r\nand magnetic, the mechanical being those that accomplish the result\r\nby purely mechanical means, the electrical being those that employ\r\nelectrical devices, and the magnetic those that depend for their\r\naction upon the attraction of magnets. The principal difficulties\r\nthat the inventors in this field have to contend with are the cost\r\nof construction and the effective insulation of conductors. With the\r\noverhead trolley the current flows out from the power house to the\r\ncars through wires carried on poles, and the poles are themselves good\r\ninsulators; but to make the work doubly sure the conductors are secured\r\nto glass insulators, which are practically perfect. The current returns\r\nto the power house through the ground and the track rails. As it is\r\neasier for the current to circulate in a short path than in a long\r\none, there is a continual tendency for it to jump from the overhead\r\nwire through the insulation to the ground, but this is effectually\r\nprevented by the very perfect character of the insulation. When the\r\noutgoing and incoming wires are both placed upon or underground the\r\nstrain upon the insulation is very much increased, for then instead of\r\nthe two lines being separated by fifteen or twenty feet of pole, which\r\nis a very fair insulator, they are separated by only a few inches of\r\nearth or perhaps metal, the first of which is a fairly good conductor,\r\nwhile the last is a nearly perfect one. It is evident, therefore, that\r\nthe insulation proper in an underground or surface system must be of\r\nthe highest order. If the conduits in which the wires are located\r\ncould be kept perfectly dry, there would be no difficulty in obtaining\r\ninsulation that would withstand the strain it is subjected to; but rain\r\nin summer and snow in winter will at times cover the tracks and fill\r\nthe conduits, hence the securing of perfect insulation presents great\r\ndifficulties. The manner in which inventors have sought to surmount\r\nthe obstacles can be made clear by the aid of a few illustrations of\r\ntypical designs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.--UNDERGROUND CONDUIT WITH PROTECTING SHIELD FOR\r\nTHE CONDUCTOR.]\r\n\r\nFig. 25 shows one of the forms of a class of underground conduits\r\nbelonging to the inclosed conductor type. The track rails are supported\r\nupon the outer ends of large castings, _F F_, commonly called yokes.\r\nThese are made of such size that the portion below the opening which\r\nincloses the conduit may be of sufficient depth to afford the requisite\r\nstrength to properly support the track. The conductor that carries the\r\ncurrent is located at _f_ and is insulated from the casing _j_, which\r\nforms the lower half of the conduit, by the stands _g_. From the car a\r\nbar, _P_, which is called a plow, projects downward through the slot\r\nbetween the rails, _k k_, and on its end is spread out into a fork,\r\n_d_, which carries a pulley, _e_. When this pulley is in contact with\r\nthe conductor _f_ the current passes through the plow _P_ to the motors\r\nupon the car, and thence to the track rails and back to the power house.\r\n\r\nAs the yokes _F F_ and the conduit casing _j_ are made of iron and\r\nare in metallic connection with the track rails, it is evident that\r\nif the conduits should fill with water to the depth of the wire _f_\r\nthe current would pass directly to the rails, and thus would avoid the\r\nlonger path through the motors. To prevent this occurrence, the sides\r\nof the conduit are inclosed with the sheet-iron covers _c c_, which\r\nnominally are in the position shown by the dotted lines _i i_. The\r\nplow is also provided with the arms _b b_, upon the ends of which are\r\nmounted small wheels _a a_, and these run upon tracks attached to the\r\ncovers _c c_. As is shown in the figure, the wheels _a a_, running upon\r\nthe tracks attached to the covers _c c_, cause the latter to spread\r\nout to the position in which they are shown. This spreading, as can be\r\nreadily understood, only takes place for a short distance ahead and\r\nbehind the plow, but at all other parts of the conduit the sides assume\r\nthe position _i i_, and thus close the conduit and exclude the water.\r\n\r\nIt can be easily seen that some difficulty would be encountered in\r\nmaking a tight joint at _h h_, and also that the opening and closing of\r\nthe sides might not operate as perfectly in practice as upon paper, but\r\nit does not follow from these facts that the design is not practical;\r\nit simply illustrates that there are many minor difficulties to be\r\novercome in order that complete success may be attained. Many designs\r\noperating upon this principle have been patented, and in some of them a\r\ngreat amount of ingenuity is displayed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26.--UNDERGROUND CONDUIT WITH INCLOSED CONDUCTOR.]\r\n\r\nFig. 26 illustrates another type of inclosed conductor which at a first\r\nglance appears to be far superior to that just described, but upon\r\ncloser investigation it is found to be not wholly free from objections\r\nthat are difficult to overcome. The yoke _F F_, as in the design just\r\ndescribed, is made wide enough to support upon its outer ends the track\r\nrails _R R_, and is cut away in the middle to an outline conforming\r\nwith the shape of the conduit. The conductor that carries the current\r\nis located at _d_, being supported by the stands _e_. An elastic tube\r\n_f_ is provided, which is water-tight and thus excludes moisture from\r\nits interior, within which the conductor _d_ is located. On the top of\r\ntube _f_ a flexible rail _b_ is secured, and this connects with studs\r\n_c_, which are within the tube, as clearly shown in the drawing, and so\r\nsituated that they may be forced down into contact with _d_. Normally\r\nthese studs are separated from _d_, but when the car comes along, the\r\nwheel _a_, mounted upon the end of plow _P_, flattens the tube _f_ and\r\nthus forces one or more of the studs _c_ into contact with _d_. The\r\ndistance between the studs _c_ is such that at least two will always be\r\nin contact with _d_, thus insuring a continuous electrical connection\r\nwith the motors so long as the plow is depressed.\r\n\r\nThe first impression upon looking at this design would be that it is\r\nentirely free from objections; for if we assume that the tube _f_ is\r\nmade of rubber, we can see it in our mind's eye springing up after\r\nthe plow passes by and thus separating the contacts _c_ from _d_, and\r\nat the same time yielding freely to the pressure of the wheel _a_.\r\nAll of this is true, but rubber is not very durable when under such\r\nexposed conditions, and to maintain a length of several miles of it in\r\na perfect state for even two or three years could not reasonably be\r\nexpected; and if it became necessary to renew the tube oftener than\r\nthis the cost of maintenance would be entirely too great. There is\r\nanother objection, however, which is more serious, and that is that the\r\nconduit will gradually fill up with dirt, and this pressing against the\r\nrubber tube would force it out of shape, and thus cause the contacts\r\n_c_ to bear permanently upon _d_, or else to become so far displaced\r\nthat they would not touch it when depressed by the plow.\r\n\r\nAs the rubber tube can not be depended upon, inventors have sought\r\nto improve the construction by using sheet steel and making the\r\ntube flatter and much wider, so that a section of it would present\r\nan outline much resembling an elliptic carriage spring. Such a\r\nconstruction will meet the requirements as to strength and the\r\nretention of the contacts _c_ in their proper position; but steel\r\nexpands when warm and contracts when cooled, therefore a long tube\r\nwould be stretched so much in winter that it might pull apart, while in\r\nsummer it would be compressed and tend to buckle up and thus be forced\r\nout of place. These difficulties can be overcome by providing expansion\r\njoints at suitable intervals, so that they are not necessarily proof\r\nof the impracticability of devices based upon the principles involved\r\nin this design; they simply serve to forcibly bring to mind the fact\r\nthat the path of the inventor of underground systems is not strewn with\r\nroses, no matter in what direction he may turn to find a solution of\r\nthe problem.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27.--UNDERGROUND CONDUIT WITH EXPOSED CONDUCTORS.]\r\n\r\nThe object in the designs Figs. 25 and 26 is to shield the conductor\r\nso that it will remain dry should the conduit be filled or partially\r\nfilled with water. If water could be excluded from the conduit, the\r\ncasing _j c c_, in the first figure, and the tube _f_, in the second\r\none, would not be required, for there is no difficulty in providing an\r\ninsulating support that will hold the conductor firmly in place and\r\nat the same time prevent the escape of the current; but as soon as\r\nmoisture collects upon the surfaces of the insulating supports it acts\r\nas a conductor, and thus renders the insulation of little value. If\r\nwater runs into the conduit in such quantities as to come in contact\r\nwith the conductor, then the effect of the insulation is entirely\r\ndestroyed; the aim of the inventors, therefore, is to provide means for\r\npreventing the accumulation of water or moisture around the conducting\r\nwire. It can be readily seen that the shorter the conductor the easier\r\nit is to protect it, and this fact has given rise to the development of\r\na great number of designs classified as sectional conductors. In these,\r\ntwo conductors are used, one of which is continuous and so situated\r\nand insulated that it can not under any conditions be reached by either\r\nmoisture or water. The other conductor is made in lengths that vary\r\nall the way from fifteen to two or three hundred feet. Normally, these\r\nshort sections are not connected with the circuit--they are dead, as\r\nit is called--but when the car comes along, the plow, by acting upon\r\nsuitable mechanism, establishes a connection between the continuous\r\nconductor and the portion of the sectional conductor that is directly\r\nunder it, and in this way the current passes to the car. As soon\r\nas the car passes beyond a section of the sectional conductor, the\r\nconnection between it and the continuous wire is broken automatically.\r\nSome of these arrangements depend upon mechanical devices, such as\r\nlevers that are struck by the plow and thereby move a switch that\r\ncloses a connection between the section and the continuous conductor,\r\nbut in most instances the switch is operated by a magnet, which may\r\nbe carried by the car or may be arranged so as to be energized as the\r\ncar approaches it. Designs of this last type come under the head of\r\nelectrically operated sectional conductor systems. There are other\r\narrangements in which a magnet carried by the car attracts iron levers\r\nsuitably disposed along the conduit, and these levers close switches\r\nthat connect the section of conductor under the car with the continuous\r\none. As the levers are actuated by the magnet, they only hold the\r\nswitch closed while the latter passes over them; thus the electrical\r\nconnection is made and broken as the car moves along.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28.--VIEW OF STREET RAILWAY LINES IN WASHINGTON\r\nOPERATED BY UNDERGROUND CONDUCTOR OF TYPE SHOWN IN FIG. 27.]\r\n\r\nMost of the designs in which sectional conductors are used can be\r\nplaced much nearer to the surface of the street than the types\r\nillustrated in Figs. 25 and 26, and this is a decided advantage, as it\r\ngreatly reduces the cost of construction. Any system that requires an\r\nunderground conduit, with the yokes _F F_ to support the track, can\r\nonly be used by roads upon which the traffic is very great, for the\r\ncost of construction would be such as to prohibit its use under any\r\nother conditions, no matter how successful its operation might be. For\r\nsmall roads with moderate traffic the question of first cost is of\r\nparamount importance, and the only system that can offer a satisfactory\r\nsolution of the problem for these is one that does not require an\r\nunderground conduit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29.--CROSS-SECTION OF RAILWAY TRACK PROVIDED WITH\r\nTHIRD-RAIL CONDUCTOR.]\r\n\r\nAlthough many patents have been taken out for systems similar to\r\nthose described in the foregoing, nothing has been done practically\r\nwith any of them except in an experimental way. Some are in operation\r\non small roads in out-of-the-way places, being intended principally\r\nto illustrate the practicability of the system and thus assist in\r\npromoting its introduction elsewhere, but the system that has been\r\nadopted in a commercial way is one in which no attempt is made to\r\nshield the conductor from moisture and water, and for its successful\r\noperation dependence is placed entirely upon the proper drainage of\r\nthe conduit. This system is well illustrated in Fig. 27. The plow _P_\r\ncarries upon its end two brushes, _b b_, which are insulated from each\r\nother. These brushes rub against the conductors _a a_, which are made\r\nof bars of channel iron and are well insulated from the yokes _F F_ and\r\nthe conduit casing to which they are attached by means of the supports\r\n_c c_. In the construction shown in the figure the current comes\r\nfrom the generator through one of the _a_ bars and returns through\r\nthe other, but both bars can be used to conduct the current from the\r\ngenerator, in which case the return can be effected through the track\r\nrails, just as in the designs already considered. If both the bars _a\r\na_ are used to convey the current from the power house the insulation\r\nbetween the brushes _b b_ is not required. To avoid the accumulation\r\nof water in the conduit the drain _G_ is provided with outlets _d_,\r\nlocated at suitable points.\r\n\r\nAlthough this system is the simplest that can be devised for use in\r\nstreets or public highways its construction is very costly, so much so\r\nthat it can only be used in cities where the traffic is so great as to\r\nrequire the running of cars on short headway; and, furthermore, it can\r\nnot be operated with any degree of success except in municipalities\r\nwhere there is a good sewage system. During the summer months it is\r\nliable to be more or less impaired by heavy showers, but the trouble in\r\nsuch cases is only temporary. In winter time snowstorms are liable to\r\naffect it in the same way, especially if, after a heavy fall, a warm\r\nwave comes along and produces a rapid thaw.\r\n\r\nFrom the fact that no attempt whatever is made to protect the\r\nconductors, one would naturally suppose that every time there is a rain\r\nthe road would be compelled to shut down; for, as the slot through\r\nwhich the plow travels is open, water can enter the conduit with the\r\ngreatest freedom, and, in trickling down the sides, would be caught\r\nto some extent upon the brackets _c c_, and thus make its way over to\r\nthe channel bars _a a_, and thereby destroy the insulation. Practice,\r\nhowever, shows that this action does not take place, at least not so\r\noften as to produce any serious trouble. The roads that are operated\r\nby electricity in New York, and also the lines of the Capital Traction\r\nCompany, of Washington, D. C., employ this system, and they have been\r\nin operation a sufficient length of time to fully demonstrate that\r\nthe difficulties actually developed by the action of the elements are\r\nnot of a formidable character. On one occasion the Sixth Avenue road,\r\nin New York, was compelled to stop its cars for a short time just\r\nafter a severe snowstorm, but the failure was not due to impairment of\r\nthe insulation, according to the statements of the officials of the\r\ncompany, but to the fact that the melted snow froze upon the track and\r\ncaused the wheels to slip around without sending the car ahead. The\r\nfact that other roads in New York, belonging to the same company, are\r\nbeing equipped with the system, is proof that, upon the whole, its\r\npractical operation is regarded as satisfactory; but it is very evident\r\nthat it is not the final solution of the problem. A system to be a\r\ndecided success must cost very little more than the ordinary overhead\r\ntrolley, and its construction must be such that it will not easily get\r\nout of order. If it is not inexpensive it will not come into use except\r\nin places where the authorities will not permit the overhead wires.\r\nA surface or underground system ought to be more durable than the\r\noverhead, as the wires are not liable to be injured by high winds or\r\nthe accumulation of ice and snow; and, furthermore, as the conductors\r\nare below the ground the danger of burning out motors and generators\r\nby lightning would be eliminated, and this is a serious matter with\r\nall trolley roads, especially in cities. Country roads do not suffer\r\nso much from lightning, because when there is a heavy thunderstorm\r\nthe generators are stopped and the trolley poles are pulled away from\r\nthe wire, the cars remaining stalled on the track until the storm\r\npasses over. This course can not be pursued by city roads, for the\r\npassengers feel that, lightning or no lightning, they must reach their\r\ndestination, therefore the cars must continue to run and take their\r\nchances. Lightning, however, does not strike trolley lines as often in\r\ncities as in the open country, owing to the fact that there are so many\r\niron buildings and roofs to attract it in other directions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30.--VIEW OF A SECTION OF THE NEW YORK, NEW HAVEN\r\nAND HARTFORD RAILROAD, EQUIPPED WITH THE THIRD-RAIL SYSTEM.]\r\n\r\nFig. 28 shows the appearance of the street surface when an underground\r\nsystem such as is illustrated in Fig. 27 is used. This figure is a\r\nphotograph of the Capital Traction Company's lines in Washington.\r\nAfter looking at this picture one can not deny that the appearance\r\nof the streets of a city is greatly improved when the overhead wires\r\nare removed, but underground systems which require a plow to run in a\r\ngroove are not without objection, for the groove forms a dangerous trap\r\ninto which the narrow-tired wheels of light wagons can readily drop,\r\nand the toes and heels of horseshoes can be caught. Thus, unless the\r\nslot can be dispensed with the greater beauty overhead is obtained at\r\nthe expense of increased danger on the street surface. There are quite\r\na number of underground conductor systems in which the slot is not\r\nused, the current being conveyed to the car by contact made with plates\r\nset at suitable intervals between or along the sides of the tracks, and\r\non a level with the street surface. Many of these arrangements appear\r\nto be quite practical, but none of them can attract the attention of\r\nrailroad managers unless it can be constructed at a reasonable cost.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31.--CROSS-SECTION OF RAILWAY TRACK, SHOWING A\r\nMODIFICATION OF THE THIRD-RAIL SYSTEM.]\r\n\r\nAbout two years ago the New York, New Haven, and Hartford Railroad\r\npublished a report of the performance of a branch line that was\r\nequipped with electric motors, the current being conveyed to them by\r\nmeans of a third rail. Some of the sensational dailies at once took\r\nthe matter up and heralded the third rail to the public as something\r\nentirely new and sure to supersede the trolley. Now, as a matter of\r\nfact, the third rail is one of the oldest arrangements that have been\r\nused, and was in daily operation in Baltimore in 1886. It is a very\r\ncheap system and well adapted to roads owning the right of way or\r\nrunning upon elevated tracks, but could not be used on public highways\r\nor streets. The third-rail system in its simplest form is shown in\r\nFig. 29, which represents a section through the roadbed. The log _A_\r\nrepresents a tie or sleeper, and _c c_ are the track rails, while _b_\r\nis the third rail through which the current passes to the motors.\r\nBetween the rail _b_ and the tie _A_ is placed a piece of insulating\r\nmaterial, _a_, of such dimensions as may be necessary. If the track is\r\nhigh above the surrounding ground, so as to not be submerged when there\r\nis a heavy fall of rain, _a_ may be thin, but otherwise it must be of\r\nsufficient thickness to raise the rail above the high-water mark. The\r\ncar is provided with a wheel or brush to bear upon the rail _b_.\r\n\r\nThis is the construction used upon the New York, New Haven, and\r\nHartford Railroad, as can be seen from Fig. 30, which is a photograph\r\nof a section of the road. The third rail, it will be seen, is raised\r\nbut slightly from the ties, just about as shown in Fig. 29. One\r\nobjection to this construction is that persons and animals can receive\r\nshocks by touching the center rail and one of the side ones at the same\r\ntime, as, for example, by standing with one foot on each. Such shocks\r\nwould not prove fatal to men, as the currents used for railway work\r\nare not of a sufficiently high electro-motive force to produce death,\r\nbut the shock is nevertheless very severe. Horses and cattle would be\r\nkilled outright, as these animals are not able to withstand as strong\r\na shock as human beings. To render the third-rail system safer, and\r\nalso to improve the insulation of the conducting rail, the construction\r\nillustrated in Fig. 31 has been devised. The only difference between\r\nit and Fig. 29 is that the rail _b_, instead of resting upon the ties\r\nbetween the tracks, is carried upon a side support _c c_ and is housed\r\nin with boards _a a_. To take the current from it a wheel is mounted\r\nupon a shaft projecting from the side of the car truck.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32--ELECTRIC LOCOMOTIVE ON THE BUFFALO AND LOCKPORT\r\nRAILWAY.]\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing brief description of the essential features of the\r\nseveral systems devised for conveying current to the moving car by\r\nmeans of conductors placed underground or upon the surface, it can\r\nbe seen that while the result can be accomplished in many ways, and\r\nis actually accomplished in a number of instances, nothing has been\r\nbrought forward so far that is as free from objection as the simple\r\ntrolley, if we disregard the unsightliness of the latter. It is this\r\nunsightliness that has created a demand for something else, but the\r\nsubstitutes, while capable of doing the work, are far more costly and\r\ncan not be said to be as reliable under all conditions of weather.\r\n\r\nThe sphere of action of the electric-railway motor is not confined to\r\nstreet railways or suburban transit, but extends to the legitimate\r\ndomain of the steam locomotive. In many places electric locomotives are\r\nused to move freight trains made up of cars of the largest capacity,\r\nthis same work having been done formerly by steam locomotives. In\r\nthe city of Baltimore, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad uses electric\r\nlocomotives, of greater capacity than any steam locomotives so far\r\nmade, to draw trains through the tunnel that passes under the city. The\r\ngeneral appearance of an electric locomotive can be judged from Fig.\r\n32, which shows an engine of average size at the head of a long freight\r\ntrain.\r\n\r\n\r\n MM. Bertaux and G. Yver are quoted, in _La Nature_, as relating in\r\n their travels in Italy that between Benevento and Foggia, where the\r\n railway passes through a tract of wheat fields, a falcon was observed\r\n closely accompanying the train. He would graze the windows, fly over\r\n the roofs of the cars and turn, and keep constantly dashing down to\r\n the ground by the side of the track. A habitual traveler on the road\r\n remarked that he had observed this habit of the bird several times a\r\n week. The crafty hawk had observed that the eddy made by the train as\r\n it rushed through the air overcame the small birds and made them an\r\n easy prey, and it had learned to take advantage of the fact. It was\r\n also remarked that this particular train, which was the \"fast train,\"\r\n was the only one the bird thus pursued.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA SURVIVAL OF MEDIÆVAL CREDULITY.\r\n\r\nBY PROFESSOR E. P. EVANS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the crassest and most impudent and yet most successful frauds of\r\nmodern times is that recently practiced by Leo Taxil and his associates\r\non the papal hierarchy in their pretended exposures of the Freemasons\r\nand the Satanic rites performed by this secret fraternity. On April\r\n20, 1884, Leo XIII issued an encyclical letter in which he divides the\r\nhuman race \"into two diverse and adverse classes\" (_in partes duas\r\ndiversas adversasque_): \"the kingdom of God on earth--namely, the\r\ntrue Church of Jesus Christ\"--and \"the realm of Satan.\" All who are\r\nnot members of the former belong to the latter, so that there is no\r\nalternative between being a good Catholic or a worshiper of the devil.\r\nHis Holiness then proceeds to show that the headquarters of Satanism\r\nare the lodges of the Freemasons, a fact, he adds, fully recognized\r\nby his predecessors, who have never ceased to expose and denounce the\r\ndiabolical character and flagitious aims of these archenemies of the\r\nChristian faith. The detailed description of the organization of this\r\norder, its devilish purposes, and the horrible crimes committed in\r\norder to accomplish them are very queer reading in an official document\r\nemanating from an infallible ecclesiastical authority at the close of\r\nthe nineteenth century. On August 20, 1894, Leo XIII published a decree\r\nof the Inquisition putting under ban \"Odd Fellows, Sons of Temperance,\r\nand Knights of Pythias\" as \"synagogues of Satan,\" and excluding them\r\nfrom the sacraments of the Church.\r\n\r\nIt is no wonder that such an exhibition of credulity, which excited\r\nthe astonishment of many a Romanist and made all intelligent and\r\nunprejudiced persons smile and shrug their shoulders, should have\r\nsuggested to an arrant wag and incorrigible player of practical jokes\r\nlike Leo Taxil (pseudonym of Gabriel Jogand) the idea of appealing to\r\nthis peculiar passion on a grand scale and seeing to what extent the\r\n\"mother Church\" could be led into fraud, as Milton says, like \"Eve,\r\nour credulous mother.\" In tracing the development of this audacious\r\nplot through all its stages and perceiving by what silly tales and\r\ntransparent deceptions the Holy Father permitted himself to be duped,\r\none can hardly refrain from exclaiming, in the words of Ben Jonson:\r\n\r\n              \"Had you no quirk\r\n  To avoid gullage, sir, by such a creature?\"\r\n\r\nLeo Taxil was born at Marseilles on March 21, 1854, and was therefore\r\nthirty years of age when he entered upon this career of intrigue and\r\nmystification. From his childhood he had been educated in strictly\r\nRoman Catholic schools, and everything was done by his pious parents\r\nand teachers to render him sound in the faith. Long before arriving at\r\nman's estate he had thrown off these influences and cast in his lot\r\nwith unbelievers, although he continued to go to mass, confession,\r\nand communion. While a pupil in the Catholic College of St. Louis,\r\nat Marseilles, he was strongly attracted to the political views of\r\nthe radical party as set forth in Rochefort's _Lanterne_, and soon\r\nbegan to write for the press; in 1871 he joined the editorial staff\r\nof _Egalité_, and published for two years a humoristic journal--_La\r\nMarotte_ (Fool's Bauble). It is not necessary to give a detailed\r\nsketch of this man's life. Suffice it to say that he was violently\r\nanticlerical, and was repeatedly fined and imprisoned for articles\r\ninsulting to the Church and to ecclesiastical dignitaries. On December\r\n29, 1881, at Montpellier, he was condemned to pay a fine of sixty-five\r\nthousand francs for publishing a book entitled The Secret Amours of\r\nPius IX. He appealed from this decision, and, after repeated efforts,\r\nsucceeded in having the indictment quashed. A new edition appeared in\r\n1885, and was announced by large placards, in the center of which was\r\na medallion of the Pope's head, encircled with the heads of a bevy of\r\nbeautiful women, forming, according to the author, a fitting halo for\r\nhis Holiness. We may add that the sensational revelations contained\r\nin this book, as well as in the Scandalous History of the Orléans and\r\nsimilar works, are for the most part mere figments of the imagination\r\nrecorded as facts, for the purpose of mystifying a credulous public. In\r\n1880 he founded a \"Society of Freethinkers,\" which, with its numerous\r\nbranches, numbered in a few years about seventeen thousand members. The\r\nremarkable success of this movement was due in a great measure to the\r\nenergy with which he advocated it in the columns of the _République\r\nAnti-Clericale_, of which he was the editor.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most comical episode in his strange career is his pretended\r\nrepentance, resulting in the return of this black sheep to the fold of\r\nthe Catholic Church. In his Confessions the arrant renegade relates\r\nhow, on April 3, 1885 (April 1st would have been a more appropriate\r\ndate), while engaged in writing a book on Joan of Arc designed to\r\nexcite animosity against the clergy, his fell purpose was suddenly\r\nshaken by strong compunctions, and soon a fearful agitation convulsed\r\nhis whole being. His description of his contrition and self-reproaches\r\nis quite sensational and thrilling, and shows rare talent as an\r\nactor, if we only bear in mind that the whole thing was a farce. \"I\r\nburst into sobs. 'Pardon me, O God!' I cried out in a voice choked\r\nwith tears. 'Pardon my many blasphemies! Pardon all the evil I have\r\nwrought!' I passed the night in prayer, and resolved on the next day\r\nto seek absolution for my sins.\" He retired from the editorship of\r\nthe _République Anti-Clericale_, and handed in his resignation at a\r\nmeeting of the \"Anti-Clerical League,\" of which he was the founder\r\nand hitherto the most active member, when he had the satisfaction of\r\nbeing denounced by the presiding officer as a comedian and scoundrel.\r\nNo one of his former colleagues believed in his sincerity, and yet\r\nevery one was puzzled to understand the strategic purpose of this\r\nretrograde movement. The general impression was that he had been\r\nbribed. \"You can't fool us by your abjuration!\" they exclaimed. \"The\r\nfact is, you have received a large sum of money from the Vatican.\" He\r\ndoes not seem to have attempted to refute these charges, nor did he\r\npermit them to divert him from the execution of his deep-laid plot.\r\nWith hypocritical humility, he made full confession to the papal\r\nnuncio in Paris, Monsignore Di Rende, who, after subjecting him to\r\nseveral days' penance, embraced him with joy and released him from all\r\nexcommunications and ecclesiastical censures.\r\n\r\nTaxil now began to issue his Complete Revelations concerning\r\nFreemasonry, in four volumes, the ostensible object of which was to\r\nexpose the secret and sacrilegious rites of this order as an organized\r\nsystem of devil-worship, thus confirming by the testimony of an\r\neyewitness the assertions of the Popes, and proving that their decrees\r\nand decisions on this point had been bulls in the ecclesiastical and\r\nnot in the Irish sense of the term. This work, although a mere tissue\r\nof fabrications, was greeted by the Catholic press and priesthood\r\nwith exultation, as an authentic narration containing positive and\r\nirrefutable proofs of the diabolic character of the Masonic mysteries.\r\nThe members of this fraternity, says Taxil, regard the God of the\r\nCatholics as an evil principle--a crafty, jealous, and cruel genius,\r\na supernal tyrant, and archenemy of human happiness. Opposed to him\r\nis Lucifer, the good genius, the perennial source of virtue and\r\nwisdom, the spirit of freedom, and the friend of mankind. For this\r\nreason, in the high-grade lodges Lucifer, the reputed father of Cain,\r\nCanaan, and Hiram, is adored, under different names indicative of the\r\nSupreme Being, as the God of Nature, and the great architect of the\r\nuniverse. In short, while modern freethinking is atheistic and begets\r\na skepticism which, even when not denying God, does not care for him,\r\nFreemasonry is essentially a Satanic cult. These words give the sum\r\nand substance of the supposititious disclosures which excited such\r\nintense joy in the clerical camp. In 1887, when Taxil was received\r\nin solemn audience by Leo XIII, \"My son,\" asked the Pope, \"what dost\r\nthou desire?\" \"Holy Father, to die this moment at thy feet were for\r\nme the highest bliss,\" replied the kneeling penitent. \"Not so,\" was\r\nthe benignant response of the successor of St. Peter; \"thy life is\r\nstill very useful in combats for the faith.\" His Holiness then pointed\r\nto Taxil's writings on the shelves of his library, declaring that he\r\nhad read them all through with extreme satisfaction, and encouraged\r\nhim to continue his exposures of these satellites of Satan and their\r\nabominations. Taxil left the Vatican with the papal benediction and\r\nwith the firm conviction that he could devise no better means of\r\ncurrying favor with the Apostolic See than by inventing tales about the\r\nhomage paid by the Freemasons to the devil, and determined to work this\r\nrich vein to its utmost capacity. He also came to the conclusion that\r\nhe could imagine nothing so absurd that it would not be received in\r\nCatholic circles as authentic and indorsed by infallible authority.\r\n\r\nHis work had an immense pecuniary success, and thus attained the\r\nchief object which he had in view. More than one hundred thousand\r\ncopies of the original French edition were sold, and it was translated\r\ninto English, German, Italian, and Spanish. This result is not so\r\nsurprising, if we remember that nearly all the bishops and other clergy\r\nof the Catholic Church acted as voluntary and extremely zealous agents\r\nfor the diffusion of these Revelations, which they seemed to regard\r\nas a new apocalypse designed to unveil the mysteries of Babylon and\r\ndisclose the present doings of Satan and dominion of antichrist. Of the\r\nutterly apocryphal character of the Revelations they do not appear to\r\nhave entertained the slightest suspicion, although the hoax was clearly\r\nperceptible to every unprejudiced mind. The German translation by the\r\nJesuit Father Gruber, which appeared at Freiburg, in Switzerland, and\r\nat Paderborn, in Westphalia, omitted the volume entitled The Masonic\r\nSisters, on account of the indecency of its contents, although accepted\r\nas true and deemed especially damaging to the Masonic fraternity.\r\nHowever desirable it might be to tear away the mask of philanthropy\r\nfrom the face of Freemasonry and let the world see its devilish\r\nfeatures, it was thought best not to outrage the moral sense of the\r\ncommunity by uncovering \"the filthiness of the hellish crew.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1892 Taxil's coadjutor, Dr. Bataille (a pseudonym of Dr. Karl Hacks,\r\na German from the Rhineland), began to issue a serial publication,\r\nentitled The Devil in the Nineteenth Century, purporting to embody\r\nthe results of his observations as ship's surgeon during his travels\r\nin various countries, and especially in the Orient, where he had\r\nopportunities of studying Satanism in its diverse manifestations. He\r\nbegins by referring to the encyclical letter _Humanum genus_, already\r\ncited, in which Leo XIII divides the human race into worshipers of God\r\nand worshipers of Satan, and then proceeds to adduce facts proving the\r\ncorrectness of this classification. It is, in reality, a bold burlesque\r\nof the papal circular, as, indeed, it was intended to be, and would\r\ndoubtless have been laughed at for a time as a clever persiflage, if\r\nthe dignitaries of the Church had not taken it seriously, as they were\r\nexpected to do. Dr. Hacks confessed to an \"interviewer,\" in 1897, that\r\nno sooner had he read the pontifical circular in question than he saw\r\nin it \"a rare opportunity to coin money out of the crass credulity and\r\nboundless stupidity of the Catholics. It needed only a Jules Verne to\r\nclothe these extravagant fancies in an attractive garb. I resolved to\r\nplay the part of this Jules Verne. Strangely enough, the same idea\r\noccurred to others. I therefore joined forces with Leo Taxil and a few\r\nfriends, and began to publish The Devil in the Nineteenth Century, the\r\nsuccess of which is well known.... I had traversed many lands and got\r\nup marvelous stories, the scenes of which were laid in remote regions,\r\nwhich I was sure no one would visit in order to test the truth of my\r\nassertions.\" Besides, he counted on the silliness of the persons with\r\nwhom he had to deal, and felt certain that if he should tell them he\r\nhad been fooling them they would not believe him, but would remain\r\nconvinced that all his inventions were strictly true. He could not\r\nconceive of a body of ecclesiastics as ready to discard a belief which\r\nserved their turn, however evident its absurdity might be to other\r\nminds. \"Sometimes I fabricated the most incredible stories, as, for\r\nexample, that of the serpent inditing prophecies with its tail on the\r\nback of Sophia Walder, or that of the demon, who, in order to marry a\r\nFreemason, transformed himself into a young lady, and played the piano\r\nevenings in the form of a crocodile. My colleagues were aghast, and\r\nexclaimed, 'You'll spoil the whole joke with your nonsense.' 'Bah!' I\r\nreplied. 'Let me be, and you will see!'\" And they did see how eagerly\r\nsuch gross falsehoods were accepted as positive facts. Protestants\r\nwithout exception are denounced as godless apostates. Every Lutheran\r\nis a Luciferian in disguise. Singapore, he says, like every British\r\ncolony, is settled by knaves, footpads, and all sorts of criminals. The\r\nProtestant Englishman is, at the bottom, an embodiment of scoundrelism\r\ncoupled with Satanism. There is a strangely infernal element in the\r\nsocial life at Singapore. \"The British matrons and even the maidens are\r\nincarnations of vice and godlessness. The young English woman dedicates\r\nall her charms and intelligence to the service of Satan, whose apostle\r\nand agent she is; cursed by God, she is the dearly beloved paramour of\r\nLucifer; a woman only in name, she is in fact absolutely infernal--an\r\nactual deviless.\" Hacks asserts that in a Presbyterian church at\r\nSingapore he discovered a secret tabernacle for the worship of Satan.\r\nThe pastor opened the door, and there was a Baphomet, with all the\r\nPalladistic (Satanic) apparatus--goblet, host, and dagger--standing\r\nbefore his eyes.\r\n\r\nAlbert Pike, Grand Master of the Freemasons in Charleston, S. C., is\r\ncalled the \"Satanic Pope,\" and is said to have a telephone invented and\r\noperated by devils, whereby instantaneous communication is possible\r\nbetween the seven principal directorates at Charleston, Rome, Berlin,\r\nWashington, Montevideo, Naples, and Calcutta. He has also a magic\r\nbracelet, by means of which he can summon Lucifer at any moment. \"One\r\nday Satan took Pike gently in his arms and made a trip with him to\r\nSirius, traversing the whole distance in a few minutes. After exploring\r\nthe fixed star, he was brought back safe and sound to his room in\r\nWashington.\" Whether he found the star as hot and scorching as its name\r\nimplies is not stated. Hacks discovered, under the cliffs of Gibraltar,\r\nmysterious caverns with laboratories in which devils prepared microbes\r\nfor generating and diffusing epidemics. He was politely received by\r\nTubal-Cain, the director of the establishment, who addressed him in\r\npure Parisian French, from which we may infer that this is the language\r\nof the lower regions. On his departure Hacks was presented with a small\r\nvial, the contents of which would suffice to produce a fearful epidemic\r\nof cholera. No less an authority than Professor Bautz, of the Prussian\r\nAcademy at Münster, tells us that the volcanoes are the flues of hell,\r\nand it was probably this contribution to the topography of Tartarus\r\nthat led Hacks to look for the devil's workshop in the cavities of\r\nmountains, which, however, being used for infernal purposes, would\r\nhardly be what Milton calls \"umbrageous grots and caves of cool\r\nrecess.\"[8]\r\n\r\nThe following may be cited as a specimen of the manner in which\r\nhistorical events were perverted by Hacks to subserve his purpose:\r\nBefore the capture of Rome by the Italian troops in 1870, a secret\r\nmeeting of Freemasons was held in Milan, at which Riboli, Cucchi, and\r\nGeneral Cadorna were present, and the revolutionary deliberations\r\nwere rendered piquant by dreadful blasphemies. Thus General Cadorna, a\r\nrenegade priest, parodied the consecration of the host with a piece of\r\nbread, which he finally threw into the fire with the words, \"In honor\r\nof Lucifer!\" Thereupon Lucifer rose up in person through the floor,\r\ngazed benignantly for a moment on his faithful followers, and said,\r\n\"The moment is come for firing the third salvo of cannon.\" A month\r\nlater General Cadorna entered Rome through the breach of the Porta\r\nVia. In Luciferian lingo, the first salvo was the Reformation and the\r\nsecond the French Revolution, while the third victory of Satan was the\r\noverthrow of the Pope's temporal power.\r\n\r\nHacks relates that in Freiburg, Switzerland, there was a Masonic\r\ntemple of Satan hewn in a rock and provided with altars and all the\r\nparaphernalia of this cult. There men and women assembled in the\r\ncostume worn by our first parents before the fall. Attached to the\r\nlodge was a brothel, the scene of the most disgusting debaucheries. One\r\naltar, in the form of a triangle with an image of the demon Baphomet,\r\nwas used for stabbing the body of Christ, in the form of consecrated\r\nwafers, with a dagger. At this altar, too, was said the so-called\r\n\"black mass,\" an invention of the Grand Master Holebrook and Albert\r\nPike, of Charleston. During this service hymns were sung to Satan. The\r\nconsecrated wafers were procured by Miss Lucia Claraz, of Freiburg,\r\nwho stole them while pretending to partake of the communion, and\r\npassed the night before committing the theft in the wildest orgies.\r\nThis incredibly foolish story was published in the _Moniteur de Rome_,\r\nagainst which Miss Claraz, a lady \"piously inclined and morally\r\nirreproachable,\" according to the testimony of the Bishop of Freiburg,\r\nbrought suit for defamation. The court sentenced the editor, Monsignore\r\nVöglin, to a fine of twenty-five thousand lire and four years'\r\nimprisonment.\r\n\r\nThese examples suffice to show the wretched stuff which Hacks hashed\r\nup for the edification of the clerical and the entertainment of the\r\ncarnal-minded public. Even the silly statement that he saw a gigantic\r\ntree bow down before Sophia Walder, the predestined great-grandmother\r\nof antichrist, and present her with a bouquet, did not shake the faith\r\nof the true believers. The editor of the _Revue Mensuelle_ declared, in\r\n1894, that Dr. Bataille had really made all these discoveries on his\r\ntravels, and that his honesty and sincerity were beyond question. This\r\nwas the attitude of the whole clerical press almost without exception,\r\nas well as of abbots, bishops, cardinals, and the highest dignitaries\r\nof the Church. Even as late as July, 1897, when the imposture had been\r\nexposed and confessed, a Parisian Catholic journal continued to regard\r\n\"the mystification as more apparent than actual, and the documents\r\nadduced as chiefly authentic\"; so difficult is it for minds thus\r\nconstituted, with the rational faculties dwarfed and stunted by being\r\nconstantly kept in the leading strings of credulity, to recognize the\r\nfalsity of what they wish or are told to believe.\r\n\r\nAnother of Taxil's confederates was Domenico Margiotta, according to\r\nhis own account a native of Palmi, in southern Italy, and professor of\r\nliterature and philosophy. His principal work, Adriano Lemmi, Supreme\r\nHead of the Freemasons, published in French in 1894, gives a long\r\nlist of his titles, designed to impress the public by indicating his\r\nhigh position in the Masonic order. Hacks calls him a \"Member of the\r\nSovereign Sanctuary of the Oriental Rite of Memphis and Mizraim,\" a\r\npurely fictitious designation. This cunning device was also crowned\r\nwith complete success, and caused the fabricated disclosures to be\r\nhailed with enthusiasm. Here, exclaimed the clerical journals, we\r\nhave \"not an apprentice or novice like Taxil, but one of the highest\r\ndignitaries of universal Freemasonry and Luciferianism, who is\r\ninitiated and instructed in all its mysteries and occult observances,\"\r\nbeing apparently ignorant of the fact that Taxil was in the main the\r\nreal author of the book.\r\n\r\nOne of the most common accusations brought against the Freemasons is\r\nthat of desecrating the host by stabbing it with a dagger. A German\r\nCatholic journal, The Pelican,[9] affirms that not only Masonic devil\r\nworshipers, but also Jews, infidels, and heretics in general commit\r\nthis sacrilege in order to show their deadly hatred of Christianity.\r\nIn proof of this charge, the following \"historical fact\" is published\r\nin the number for July, 1897: Several consecrated wafers were once\r\nstolen by Jews from a church at Langenses, in Silesia, and, after being\r\npierced through with knives, were hidden in the forest. They were\r\ndiscovered by a Polish nobleman, whose four horses, as he was driving\r\nby, suddenly kneeled down and refused to go on, although he beat them\r\nwith his whip. He then descended from the carriage, and soon found the\r\nwafers covered with blood. They were carried back with solemn ceremony\r\nto the church, which became a place of pilgrimage with a wonder-working\r\npyx. What a hardened and hopeless skeptic a man must be, who is not\r\nconvinced by conclusive evidence of this kind, when even horses bear\r\nwitness to the truth by their genuflections!\r\n\r\nStill more sensational was the part played in this spicy comedy\r\nby Miss Diana Vaughan, whom Taxil introduced to the public as a\r\ndescendant of the Rosicrucian alchemist and Oxford professor Thomas\r\nVaughan, and who was said to have in her possession a copy of the\r\nwritten pact with Satan, signed by her ancestor on March 25, 1645.\r\nThe young lady claimed to have been born in Paris on February 29,\r\n1874. The fact that there was no February 29th in the year 1874 would\r\nmake this date an impossible natal day for ordinary mortals, but a\r\nperson with Luciferian blood in her veins would naturally take no\r\nnote of the divisions of time as recorded in human calendars; for,\r\naccording to Taxil, her forbear was the goddess Astarte, who appeared\r\nto Thomas Vaughan on a summer night in 1646, while he was sojourning\r\namong the American Indians, in all her marvelous beauty, bringing\r\nwith her a bed surrounded with flames and attended by little demons\r\nbearing flowers. She approached Vaughan and put a wedding ring on his\r\nfinger, and eleven days later gave birth to a daughter named Diana,\r\nfrom whom the Miss Diana Vaughan in question traced her descent.\r\nSeveral instances of similar commerce with incarnate demons are said\r\nto have occurred in the history of her family, so that she inherited\r\na strong Satanic taint; even her own mother was guilty of the same\r\ncriminal conduct. Her inherited qualities were carefully fostered by\r\neducation, inasmuch as she was brought up by her father and uncle on\r\nstrictly Luciferian principles. One day, when her instructors were\r\npraising Cain and Judas as ideals of excellence, she expressed some\r\ndoubt of the superior worthiness of the fratricide and venal traitor.\r\nThis dangerous unbelief was attributed to angelical possession, and\r\nit was soon ascertained that the archangel Raphael was the cause of\r\nthe lapse from Luciferianism. Recourse was had to exorcism, the whole\r\nprocess of which, as described by Taxil, is a clever travesty of the\r\nceremonial prescribed by the Romish Church for the expulsion of evil\r\nspirits. The dance performed by the father and uncle on this occasion\r\nconsisted of the same saltatory movements that are executed by the\r\n\"procession of jumpers\" every year at the grave of St. Willibord, in\r\nEchternach, Luxemburg.[10] Devil's ointment took the place of holy oil,\r\nand the exorcism ended with the sacrifice of a black hen; thereupon\r\n\"Raphael\" went out of her, and simultaneously with his exit all the\r\npanes of glass in the house were broken into fragments and fell to the\r\nground with a tremendous crash. The marvel is that bishops and priests\r\naccepted this ridiculous story as an authentic and edifying narration,\r\ninstead of rejecting it with horror and disgust as a palpable burlesque\r\nof their own approved methods of casting out demons, and particularly\r\nof the _Exorcismus in Satanam et Angelos Apostatas_, composed by Leo\r\nXIII and issued by him November 19, 1890. It is evident that Taxil had\r\nthis document in his eye, and intended to hold it up to derision; to\r\ncalm the fears of the simple-minded, who were puzzled and perplexed by\r\nthe striking resemblance of diabolic orgies to divine ordinances, he\r\nexplained it on the general principle that \"Satan is the ape of God.\"\r\n\r\nAfter being freed from the influence of Raphael, Diana was placed under\r\nthe tutelage of Asmodeus, who, as her guardian devil, watched over her,\r\nshielding her from bodily harm and helping her to resist the wiles of\r\nangels. One day when she was wandering in the woods she was attacked\r\nby negroes, but Asmodeus came to her rescue, and bore her safely\r\nto her home through the air. Another time he caught her mettlesome\r\ncourser by the bridle as he was running away, and when the chief of\r\nGaribaldi's staff, Bordone, insulted her, Asmodeus twisted his neck so\r\nthat his face looked backward. For three weeks he was obliged to take a\r\nretrospective view of life and of his own conduct, when Diana, in the\r\nkindness of her heart, set his head right again. On these occasions the\r\ntutelar demon usually appeared in the form of a fine young gentleman,\r\nand emitted an aroma of balsam, which seems to have been as inseparable\r\nfrom him as is the scent of musk from a modern dude or modish dame.\r\nHe spoke of her as his bride, and often took her on pleasure trips\r\nto paradise, purgatory, and other remote regions; once when she was\r\ngreatly depressed, because her Luciferian rival, Sophia Walder, had got\r\nthe better of her, he consoled her by making an excursion with her to\r\nMars, where they rode on Schiaparelli's canals, sailed on the Sea of\r\nthe Sirens, and strolled like pygmies among the gigantic inhabitants of\r\nthat planet.\r\n\r\n[_To be concluded._]\r\n\r\n\r\n Contrary to the common supposition that the astronomy of the ancients\r\n was based exclusively on the geocentric hypothesis, Mr. G. H. Bryan\r\n says in Nature: \"Schiaparelli has shown that Heraclitus Ponticus,\r\n a disciple of Plato, had already accepted the theory that the sun\r\n is the center of the orbit of the planets, while the earth is the\r\n center of the universe and of the lunar and solar rotations--a theory\r\n substantially that of Tycho.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"RIBBON LIGHTNING.\"\r\n\r\nBY ORANGE COOK.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1898, W. H. Osborne, of Chardon, Ohio, an amateur\r\nphotographer of some experience, secured the accompanying photograph\r\nof a lightning flash which seemed to us to show certain peculiarities\r\nthat entitle it to a public notice and a permanent record. The picture\r\nshows three flashes, of which the distant and faint one at the right\r\nand the bright one at the left were simultaneous, while the center one\r\noccurred a few seconds earlier. Nothing about the thunder that followed\r\nthe last and bright flash suggested that it was specially near, but\r\nan examination of the picture when developed and a comparison with\r\nthe features of the landscape showed that it had come to earth about\r\nfifteen rods from the place where Mr. Osborne stood with his camera.\r\nMr. Osborne and myself carefully searched the locality indicated, but\r\nfailed to find even the slightest mark caused by the discharge upon any\r\nobject or in the earth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nMeasurements at this place give the width of the ribbon of light, if\r\nit stood at right angles with the line of sight, about eight feet.\r\nThis ribbon of light is seen to consist of six lines, approximately\r\nparallel, of unequal brightness, a pair being at each edge and a pair\r\nnear the center. The space between these pairs is crossed by many\r\nnearly horizontal lines and a few oblique ones, while that between\r\nthe right-hand pair is crossed by oblique lines only. The horizontal\r\nlines at the right of the center become curved downward, which, with\r\nthe increased brightness of the whole toward that side, suggests to\r\nus that the ribbon of light did not lie in a plane, but was concave\r\ntoward a point at the observer's left. That the ribbon did not stand\r\nat right angles with the line of sight, but was nearer the observer\r\nat the right-hand edge, is also shown by the inequality of the lower\r\ntermination of the six vertical lines referred to above. The ones at\r\nthe left either rest upon or are hidden behind a rise of ground, whose\r\ncrest can be traced for a little distance each side of the flash, while\r\nthose at the right come lower, falling between the observer and the\r\nground at that point. Probably, when measured upon this diagonal and\r\ncurved line, the width of the flash was fifteen or twenty feet.\r\n\r\nMention has already been made of the fact that the accompanying thunder\r\nwas comparatively light, and not at all like that ordinarily heard when\r\nlightning occurs within so short a distance. Possibly this, as well as\r\nthe absence of marks at the point where it reached the earth, might\r\nhave been because the discharge was of very low tension.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[A very similar lightning flash was described and pictured in the\r\nissue of the Electrical World and Engineer for October 28, 1899, by\r\nA. E. Kennelly, who suggested the following explanation: A lightning\r\nflash passed through the air on the left-hand side of the ribbon of\r\nlightning (the wind was blowing from right to left) and broke a hole\r\nin the air along that line. This discharge may have been oscillatory,\r\nand may have lasted in all any time up to about 1/100 of a second. The\r\ndischarge then ceased for lack of electricity, but a fresh charge from\r\nthe cloud being gathered immediately afterward, or in about 1/30 of\r\na second from the first rupture, a new discharge passed through the\r\nsame hole in the air, which had not had time to seal up. There might\r\nthus be fourteen successive flashes (this was the number of distinct\r\nflashes making up the ribbon in the photograph), each averaging about\r\n1/25 of a second apart, through the same hole, owing to the imperfect\r\nconducting qualities of the clouds overhead, meanwhile the hole having\r\nbeen carried from left to right in the picture, across the line of\r\nsight (by the wind), and thus producing the appearance of a broad\r\nribbonlike flash. Professor Trowbridge, of Cambridge, has suggested the\r\npossibility that many of these apparently curious electrical phenomena\r\nmay be of purely optical or physiological origin--that is, may arise\r\nthrough the abnormal behavior of the eye or the camera lens toward\r\nintense lines of light, such as lightning flashes.--ED.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCROSS-EDUCATION.\r\n\r\nBY E. W. SCRIPTURE,\r\n\r\nDIRECTOR OF THE PSYCHOLOGICAL LABORATORY, YALE UNIVERSITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome years ago I made the following simple experiment: I arranged a\r\nrubber bulb, like that used for releasing a photographer's shutter, to\r\nconnect with a bottle, from which rose a long, vertical glass tube.\r\nThe bottle contained mercury, and the long tube reached nearly to the\r\nbottom. Every part was air-tight, so that when anybody squeezed the\r\nbulb the mercury was forced up the vertical tube. It was what is known\r\nas a mercury-dynamometer.\r\n\r\nDuring experiments with this dynamometer, what was more natural than to\r\nthink of trying what would happen if one hand were practiced daily in\r\nsqueezing the bulb? So one of our graduate students, Miss E. M. Brown,\r\nwas set to work in the following manner: On the first day she squeezed\r\nthe bulb as hard as possible with the left hand, while an assistant\r\nnoted the height of the mercury; this was repeated ten times, and the\r\nresults were averaged. Immediately thereafter she took ten records with\r\nthe right hand. Then, on the following days, with some intermissions,\r\nshe practiced the right hand by squeezing ten times on each occasion.\r\nOn the last day she again tested the left hand, which had not been\r\npracticed in the meantime. The records ran as follows:\r\n\r\n ----------+---------------------------------------------------------------\r\n           |                                 DAY.\r\n           +------+------+------+------+------+------+-------+------+------\r\n           |First |Second|Third |Fourth|Fifth |Sixth |Seventh|Eighth|Ninth\r\n ----------+------+------+------+------+------+------+-------+------+------\r\n           |Inches|Inches|Inches|Inches|Inches|Inches|Inches |Inches|Inches\r\n Right hand| 28.8 | 33.7 | 35.6 | 36.6 | 40.9 | 44.7 | 47.0  | 48.8 | 48.6\r\n Left hand | 29.6 | .... | .... | .... | .... | .... | ....  | .... | 42.3\r\n ----------+------+------+------+------+------+------+-------+------+------\r\n\r\nThus the left hand had gained about fifty per cent in strength through\r\npractice of the right hand. This peculiar phenomenon of transference of\r\nthe effects of practice from one side to the other I have ventured to\r\ncall \"cross-education.\"\r\n\r\nThe phenomenon was curious enough to suggest other experiments. Another\r\nstudent, Miss T. L. Smith, was set to trying to insert the point of a\r\nneedle at the end of a rod into a small hole in a drill-gauge without\r\ntouching the sides. The first experiment consisted of twenty trials\r\nwith the left hand, with a success of fifty per cent. Immediately\r\nthereafter twenty trials were made with the right hand, with a success\r\nof sixty per cent. On the following day and on each succeeding day two\r\nhundred experiments were made with the right hand, with successes of\r\n61, 64, 65, 75, 74, 75, 82, 79, 78, and 88 per cent. On the last day\r\nthe left hand, which had not been practiced in the meantime, was again\r\ntried, with a success of seventy-six per cent.\r\n\r\nThese last experiments remind us of certain familiar phenomena. It has\r\nfrequently been noticed that persons taught to write with the right\r\nhand become able to write backward, but not forward, with the left\r\nhand. This is the so-called \"mirror writing,\" which appears correct if\r\nseen in a mirror. The first published observation of this fact exists\r\nin a letter from H. F. Weber to Fechner, the founder of experimental\r\npsychology. Fechner, moreover, noticed that with the left hand he could\r\nmake the figure 9 backward better than in the regular way.\r\n\r\nCuriously enough, the principle of cross-education has been put to\r\npractical use. A letter (with permission to publish) has been received\r\nfrom Oscar Raif, Professor of Music in the Berlin Hochschule:\r\n\r\n\"In the spring of 1898 I made an experiment with twenty of my pupils. I\r\nbegan by taking the average speed of each hand with the metronome. The\r\naverage of the right hand was [quarter note symbol] = 116 (= four times\r\n116 in the minute) [464 beats], and for the left hand 112 [448 beats].\r\nI gave them exercises for the right hand only (finger exercises,\r\nscales, and broken accords) to develop rapidity. After one week the\r\naverage of the right hand was 120 [480]; after two weeks, 126 [504];\r\nthree weeks, 132 [528], etc. After two months the right hand yielded\r\n176 [604]. Then I had them try the left hand, which averaged 152 [608],\r\nwhereas in November the average was only 112 [448]. In two months'\r\ntime, absolutely without practice, the left hand had risen from 112\r\n[448] to 152 [608]. A few of my pupils had some difficulty in playing\r\nthe scales in parallel motion, but were able to play them in contrary\r\nmotion.\r\n\r\n\"The tenor of my work is that in piano playing the chief requirement\r\nis _not_ that each single finger should move rapidly, but that each\r\nmovement should come at exactly the right time, and we do not work only\r\nto get limber fingers, but, more than that, to get perfect control over\r\neach finger. The source of what in German is called _Fingerfertigkeit_\r\nis the center of our nervous system--the brain.\"\r\n\r\nThese facts, however, require further investigation, for it is evident\r\nthat we must begin with the fact of cross-education and proceed to\r\nmore complicated cases. Indeed, cross-education has shown itself to\r\nbe one step of a ladder up which we must climb even if there were\r\nno other motive except that of curiosity as to what we could find\r\nat the top. If practice of one hand educates the other hand, will\r\nit not also educate the foot? Again, if practice of one hand in\r\nsqueezing a dynamometer develops the strength of the other members of\r\nthe body, will it not also develop their dexterity or their advance?\r\nAgain, if the development of voluntary power--let us say, frankly,\r\n\"will power\"--in one direction brings about a development in other\r\ndirections, why should we limit the transference to muscular activity?\r\nWhy can we not expect, that the development should be extended to the\r\nhigher forms of will power that go to make up character? The outlook\r\nbegins to be stirring on account of its vastness. If the last principle\r\nbe admitted, there seems no argument against the claim that some forms\r\nof manual training, such as lathe work and forge work, are just the\r\nthings to develop moral character. By the same reasoning we would be\r\nobliged to admit the often-made argument that training in Latin, Greek,\r\nand mathematics furnishes a means of general mental development. If we\r\nadmit the principle, we find ourselves at once involved in important\r\neducational controversies. However we may think in respect to these\r\nquestions, it is plain that it is worth while to climb a ladder which\r\nhas such an outlook at the top. Let us begin.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the fact of cross-education is established. Let\r\nus ask in what this education consists. On this point some curious\r\nobservations have been made by Prof. W. W. Davis,[11] now of Iowa\r\nCollege. The subject of the experiment began by raising a five-pound\r\ndumb-bell by flexing the arm at the elbow; this called into play\r\nchiefly the biceps muscle for lifting and the forearm muscles for\r\ngrasping. This was done as many times as possible with the right arm,\r\nand then, after a rest, with the left arm. The subject then entered\r\nupon a practice extending from two to four weeks; this consisted in\r\nlifting the weight with the right arm only. At the end both arms were\r\ntested as at the start.\r\n\r\nThe results were strange enough. The unpracticed left arm gained in\r\npower as we expected, but it also gained in size. Careful measurements\r\nwere made by Dr. J. W. Seaver, of the Yale Gymnasium, on the girths of\r\nboth upper arm and forearm. Let us compare the gains in girth with the\r\ngains in power:\r\n\r\n  ----------+------------------------------+------------------------------\r\n            |        GAINS IN GIRTH.       |       GAINS IN POWER.\r\n   SUBJECT.          +------+--------------+--------------+---------------\r\n            | Right biceps. | Left biceps. |  Right arm.  |   Left arm.\r\n  ----------+---------------+--------------+--------------+---------------\r\n       G    |     5 mm.     |    -5 mm.    | 820 flexions.| 200 flexions.\r\n       J    |     2  \"      |     0  \"     | 400    \"     | 225    \"\r\n       K    |     4  \"      |     2  \"     | 724    \"     | 514    \"\r\n       H    |    13  \"      |     6  \"     | 950    \"     |  30    \"\r\n       B    |     6  \"      |    11  \"     | 900    \"     |  75    \"\r\n       I    |     8  \"      |     3  \"     | 750    \"     |  75    \"\r\n  ----------+---------------+--------------+--------------+---------------\r\n\r\nAll subjects had gained power in the unpracticed left arm, three\r\nof them largely and three slightly. All but one had gained in the\r\nsize of the unpracticed left biceps. Strangely enough, those who had\r\ngained most in power had gained least in size. The case was quite\r\nsimilar in regard to the girth of the forearm. The gains in power were\r\nunquestionably mostly central--that is, in the nerve centers--and not\r\nin the muscles. Yet there was also a strange but unquestionable gain in\r\nthe size of the muscles at the same time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.]\r\n\r\nWe have arrived at the second step of the ladder, which is: The gain\r\nby practice which shows itself in cross-education consists in a\r\ndevelopment of higher nerve centers connected with the two sides of\r\nthe body. We must next ask: Is this effect of practice confined to the\r\nsymmetrical organ, or does it extend to other organs? This question was\r\nanswered by a peculiar experiment.\r\n\r\nThe experiment consisted in testing the effect of educating one of the\r\nfeet to tap as rapidly as possible on a telegraph key. The apparatus\r\nis shown in Fig. 1. The clocklike instrument is really a piece of\r\nclockwork actuated by a magnet, so that it counts up one point every\r\ntime the electric circuit is closed. The electric circuit is comprised\r\nof a battery and two keys. Any form of battery will do; the one in\r\nthe figure is a \"lamp battery\"--that is, an arrangement of lamps in\r\nseries and in shunt, such that the ordinary high-voltage city current\r\nis conveniently transformed into a low-voltage current. The key to the\r\nleft is the experimenter's key, and that to the right the subject's\r\nkey. When the subject is set to tapping on the latter key the counter\r\nwill register whenever the experimenter keeps his key closed.\r\n\r\nFor the actual experiments by Professor Davis the subject's key was\r\nremoved to a distant room. Here there were three keys of this kind, any\r\none of which would register. One key each was arranged for tapping with\r\nthe big toes; the third key could be tapped by either right or left\r\nindex finger.\r\n\r\nOn the first day all four digits--right and left index fingers and\r\nright and left large toes--were carefully tested in tapping as rapidly\r\nas possible. Thereafter the right large toe was practiced daily in\r\ntapping for several weeks, the other digits being left unpracticed.\r\nAt the end all four digits were again tested. Four of the six persons\r\nexperimented upon showed a gain for the right large toe--that is,\r\nfor the digit practiced; the other two showed a slight loss, due\r\nunquestionably to \"over-practice,\" or \"over-training.\" All of those\r\nwho gained for the right large toe gained for the other digits also.\r\nTheir average gains were: Right foot, thirty-three per cent; left\r\nfoot, thirty-one per cent; right hand, twenty-one per cent; left hand,\r\nthirty-one per cent. Even both of the \"over-trained\" men gained for\r\nthe left foot and one of them gained for the left hand. Thus we have\r\nreached the third step--the effects of practice are extended to various\r\nparts of the body.\r\n\r\nBeyond the third step the experimental investigations have not yet\r\nadvanced, but I believe that sooner or later we shall be able to\r\nestablish the fact that development of those forms of the will involved\r\nin simple muscular activities does also develop the more complicated\r\nforms that express themselves in acts of a mental nature.\r\n\r\nIt has long been claimed that sports, games, and manual occupations are\r\namong the best developers of character. Football develops solidarity\r\nof feeling and action; running rapids or cross-country hunting\r\ndevelop coolness in danger and promptness and firmness of judgment;\r\nwood-turning requires boldness and foresight; forge work requires\r\nregulation and reserve of power, and so on. This is no place for an\r\naccount of the psychology of sports and occupations, but if the reader\r\nhas ever tried any of these things and failed he will easily recognize\r\nthe lacking mental quality.\r\n\r\nYet there has never been but one attempt, as far as I can learn, to\r\norganize a system of manual occupations on the basis of this principle.\r\nThe success of the attempt furnishes, I believe, the still-lacking\r\nlaboratory proof of the principle itself. I refer to the remarkable\r\nexperiment of Mr. Z. R. Brockway, Superintendent of the Elmira\r\nReformatory.\r\n\r\nMost of the young felons sent to the Elmira Reformatory are set to\r\nlearning trades, by which they can support themselves on leaving.\r\nThose, however, who are too stupid to even learn the simplest trade\r\nare put into a manual-training school, in the hope that their brains\r\ncan be sufficiently developed to enable them to keep out of the prison\r\nor the asylum. Those who are so stupid that they have difficulty in\r\nlearning the alphabet or in counting their fingers are put into a\r\nkindergarten, where they practice on letter blocks and sticks and\r\nstraws.\r\n\r\nThose who are too stupid to learn a trade are the ones of interest\r\nhere. Three main lines of defect are recognized in Superintendent\r\nBrockway's classification of them. Those who are intellectually weak,\r\nbut of fair power of self-control, are classed as Group I; those who\r\nare reasonably bright, but are unable to get along because they can not\r\ncontrol their impulses, are classed as Group II; those who fail on both\r\nsides are classed as Group III.\r\n\r\nGroup II is composed of those who are for the most part devoid of moral\r\nsense--those who fight, swear, assault officers, are licentious, and\r\ngenerally unresponsive to the usual reformatory measures. To this class\r\nbelong some of the most intellectual inmates of the reformatory, but\r\nthis intellectuality runs riot on account of weakness of character.\r\nHow are their characters to be built up? They are required to devote\r\nmost of their waking hours to athletics and calisthenics, wood-turning,\r\nmaking wooden patterns for castings, mechanical drawing, sloyd, clay\r\nmodeling, and chipping and filing metal. These exercises have been\r\nselected on account of their character-building qualities.\r\n\r\nThe work is a great success. Nearly all inmates subjected to this\r\nbuilding-up process finally graduate with sufficient self-control from\r\nthe manual-training department into the trades school. A concrete\r\nexample will give an idea of the change produced in the pupil. The\r\nrecord of No. 6,361 is instructive. The account is taken from a report\r\nby the manual-training instructor, R. C. Bates:\r\n\r\n\"The pupil, previous to his assignment to manual training, had earned\r\nfor himself the sobriquet of 'dangerous man' among the officers and\r\ninmates. His offenses have been mostly threatening language, lying,\r\ncontraband articles, talking, fooling, assaulting officers, and\r\ninstitutional crimes of that nature.\r\n\r\n\"We begin his record in September, 1895, when he was reduced to the\r\nsecond grade for fighting. October and November he lost three marks\r\neach for lying and threatening language, and, by the influence of\r\nSeptember markings, caused his reduction to the third grade, or\r\nincorrigibles, a closely defined group. He was in the third grade two\r\nmonths and three days, when he was placed in the foundry, where, amid\r\nblinding smoke, stifling air, and the task system, it was thought he\r\nwould tone down, upon the theory that the muscular demands of such a\r\nplace on a 124-pound body would vitiate sufficiently to weaken the\r\nwill and curb the disposition to riotous acts.\r\n\r\n\"From January 15th to February 15th he was on modified treatment. On\r\nFebruary 18th he was unconditionally restored to the second grade.\r\nFebruary and March he did fairly well, losing one mark each month,\r\nbut in April his period of passably well-doing was checked by his\r\ncommitting an assault, along with assumption of authority, and on the\r\n27th of April he was returned to the third grade for the second time,\r\nremaining in the same two months and three days, when he was again\r\nplaced on modified treatment, and did well for three months, when he\r\nfell again, this time for fighting, losing six marks in October. In\r\nNovember he made a perfect month, securing promotion to second grade.\r\n\r\n\"On December 15, 1896, he was assigned to manual training, Group\r\nII; object, development of self-control, with subjects as follows:\r\nAthletics, drawing, sloyd, woodwork, chipping and filing, molding. Each\r\nsubject one hour and a half per day, five days per week. The influence\r\nof the new environment sustained the effort made in November to\r\nimprove, and, by securing a perfect month in December, all his past was\r\nblotted out and he was restored to the lower first grade again, through\r\n'amnesty,' on December 25, 1896.\r\n\r\n\"Thus, on December 25, 1896, he was where he was institutionally\r\nclassed at the time of his admittance two years and three months\r\nago--viz., lower first grade, from which all who are committed begin\r\nthe reformatory course of treatment, additionally thereto in the\r\nmanual-training department. His development now begins. In January,\r\n1897, he lost two marks as a result of school failures, but in February\r\nhe secured a perfect demeanor record; in March he lost two marks; April\r\nand May were perfect months in all respects, and he was graduated\r\nfrom manual training in May, returned to institutional life, and\r\nassigned to the exercise squad in the morning and stone masonry in the\r\nafternoon. Later his daily assignment was changed, placing him in the\r\nmolding class of the technological department to complete trade. His\r\ndevelopment was complete and permanent. He was returned to the manual\r\ntraining as _assistant instructor_ in the molding class, and is now\r\ndoing well in all departments, having been promoted to the upper first\r\ngrade in August and ranking as sergeant in 'I' company.\"\r\n\r\nThis record is only one example of many.\r\n\r\nWhen manual-training schools organize their courses on the principle\r\nof adapting the exercise to the ability to be developed, we shall have\r\nabundance of similar proof. When these facts have been incontestably\r\nestablished, there will be a means of satisfying the complaints of\r\nthose who are constantly attacking our schools because they develop\r\nintellect and ruin character. \"What is the use,\" say they, \"of teaching\r\nchildren to read and think if you do not make them honest and truthful?\r\nHow is it better for the community to educate liars and thieves merely\r\nthat they may lie and steal successfully in business and politics,\r\nwhere they can not be caught, rather than to leave them in the slums,\r\nwhere the police can get them?\" The accusation is bitterly unjust\r\nin many ways, but its force can be met by introducing a system of\r\ncharacter building based on a careful study of the means of developing\r\ntruthfulness, honesty, carefulness, persistence, bravery, courage under\r\ndefeat, and the other qualities that go to make up a true man. The\r\nfoundation of this system is to be found, I believe, in the _principle\r\nof character-building by motor activity_.\r\n\r\nThe ladder of cross-education will be slowly climbed by psychological\r\ninvestigators; if they find at the top a principle of such value and\r\nwide application, surely the climb will have been worth the time and\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MORBID \"SENSE OF INJURY.\"\r\n\r\nBY W. F. BECKER, M. D.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a fog about a ship removes it from exact relations to surroundings,\r\nso, from the standpoint of morbid psychology, we may fancy the mind\r\npeering through a more or less misty envelope to the true adjustment to\r\nthings--the \"glass\" through which we see \"darkly.\" Were all action and\r\nreaction of the mind to surroundings perfectly adapted, there could be\r\nsuch a thing as _absolute_ sanity. So long, however, as evolution with\r\ncontinuous readaptation and the processes of dissolution with attempted\r\nadaptations continue, so long can there be but groping, imperfect\r\nrelations to surroundings, so long must there be defective or morbid\r\nmental action, and sanity and insanity therefore but relative terms.\r\nThus many symptoms of the insane appear to be but varying degrees\r\nof the morbid mental manifestations of health, and we may assume _a\r\npriori_ that they have a common genesis and can be identified for\r\nstudy. If we take, for example, one of the commonest of these--viz.,\r\nthe idea of persecution among the insane--we may safely identify it\r\nwith the \"sense of injury\" equally common among the sane.\r\n\r\nBy this \"sense of injury\" is meant that vague sense which afflicts many\r\nof us at times of being the object of hostile feelings on the part\r\nof others. No doubt we often _are_, for, in the stress of necessary\r\nrivalry and conflict upon which progress depends, we give and take\r\ninjuries. But there remains a large excess of this \"injured\" feeling\r\nwhich can not be so explained, or which is disproportionate to its\r\ncause or entirely gratuitous, and is thus shifted into the field of\r\nmorbid psychology. This only is here treated--the _morbid_ sense of\r\ninjury.\r\n\r\nIt seems to find an easy entrance to the mind from a mere feeling of\r\nbeing ill used or stinted in sympathy to the entertainment of serious\r\ngrievances or persecutory ideas. In certain temperaments it is marked.\r\nOn so-called \"blue\" days we are constantly moved to a \"sense of injury\"\r\nfrom fancied aloofness of our friends. Madam Lofty slights us, and our\r\njaundiced imagination has it that she has heard something detrimental\r\nand dislikes us. But lo! to-day, when the liver is released, madam\r\nsmiles sweetly, and never heard a thing.\r\n\r\nSo in suspicious people. They entertain a chronic state of mind, by\r\nwhich the acts of others are given an invidious construction. They\r\nanticipate ill will, carrying the _chip_ on the shoulder. Of two\r\nconstructions of a given situation, they leap to the more offending.\r\nSome take on the vindictive attitude as a result, approaching that\r\ntype of insanity known as _paranoia_, of which Guiteau and Prendergast\r\nwere conspicuous examples; others are humiliated, as a consequence\r\napproaching the _melancholia_ type of insanity, each illustrating\r\nagain how the sane and insane states are paralleled. Many come to bear\r\nthe outward marks--the stigmata of this mental attitude, approaching\r\nsometimes the \"asylum\" face, like that of the insanely suspicious\r\nRousseau. We all know such faces, with their hard, set expressions, as\r\nif forever sealed against any tender of good will.\r\n\r\nBy a curious fact, those who invite ill will seem often to get it.\r\nSociety, based on a reciprocity of faith, seems to have no smiles to\r\nbestow upon the misanthrope. It bids him, \"Laugh, and the world laughs\r\nwith you.\" It so comes to pass that many of them acquire some real\r\nground for their \"sense of injury,\" and in the long run that real\r\nquarrels are precipitated from this atmosphere of suspiciousness.\r\nIndeed, this is the psychology of most quarrels. The _effect_ of\r\nimaginary grievances comes in turn to be the _cause_ of real ones. Thus\r\ninto an incident between two persons, one of them mistakenly reads an\r\naffront to himself. He retaliates, and the other person, unconscious\r\nof having done anything to evoke any hostility, finds _himself_\r\naffronted, and in _his_ turn retaliates. By this time real grievances\r\nhave come, and the quarrel is on. Balzac, that master analyst, in\r\nalluding to friendship, in one of his stories, says: \"It died\" (the\r\nfriendship) \"like other great passions--by a misunderstanding. Both\r\nsides imagine treachery, pride prevents an understanding, and the\r\nrupture comes.\" Just as the malevolent feelings may arise _de novo_,\r\nso it is with the benevolent ones. Nordau shows how the nondescript\r\nstate of being \"in love\" often arises. Some incident between John and\r\nMary leads one of them--we will say John--to think mistakenly that Mary\r\nhas been attracted to him. Pleased with the fact, he reciprocates.\r\nMary, altogether unconscious of the reciprocal nature of John's\r\nattention, finds pleasure in it, and in _her_ turn reciprocates. Mutual\r\nreciprocity then follows.\r\n\r\nIn irritable persons we find the morbid sense of injury coupled with\r\nresentment. Quickly interpreting anything disagreeable to them as an\r\naffront by another, their first impulse is to resent it, which they\r\ndo more or less violently, according to circumstances, their second\r\nthought often recognizing the irrational nature of the outbreak. This\r\nsuggests the feral instinct. Examples are common in the lower animals,\r\nwhile in pain attacking those about them as if they were the cause of\r\nit. No doubt this resentment is a survival from evolutionary ancestry.\r\nIt has probably served a necessary purpose in the conservation of\r\nanimal life by causing the animal to attack what may, in the jealousy\r\nof self-preservation and its feeble discrimination, even be suspected\r\nof being inimical to its welfare. Blind and unjust, perhaps, but\r\nNature hesitates at no apparent injustice to accomplish this. When\r\nwe go higher, to the tribal relation of man, we find the same blind\r\nresentment. The Australian aborigines have no conception of death,\r\nexcept as vaguely associated with homicidal causes, and when a member\r\nof a tribe dies a most natural death a member of a hostile tribe\r\nis killed to avenge the supposed murder. The Africans, too, read\r\nhomicidal forces into natural deaths. In civilized social relations it\r\nappears again in the very popular and usually irrational demand for a\r\nscapegoat when matters go wrong. The idea of religious sacrifice, too,\r\nis a practice by which the anthropomorphic God is credited with being\r\naggrieved by human conduct and of wishing to be appeased therefor.\r\nThough the exercise of this indiscriminate resentment was probably\r\ngreater and more necessary in the pre-social stage of human evolution,\r\nthere is still ground for its activity to-day in the struggle for\r\nexistence which has but changed its arena. Under a veneer of amity,\r\nlaudable enough, there are till the suspicion and resentment of the\r\ntribal relation, as we may often see unveiled in a posse of boys, and\r\nthat this resentment is yet of the blind kind, we still have proof if\r\nwe have seen an enlightened man deliberately kick a harmless chair\r\nbecause he stumbled on it in the dark.\r\n\r\nPhylogenetically, then, we see this morbid \"sense of injury\" to be\r\nreversional. This is in harmony with the atavic theory of insanity. In\r\nthe individual it is a delusion, and, like other delusions, an attempt\r\nby the reason to explain a disordered feeling; in this case a _painful_\r\nfeeling, having its origin broadly in some imperfect adaptation of the\r\norganism. This attempt to explain a feeling or sensation seems a human\r\nnecessity. However wide of the truth such explanations usually are, we\r\nseem forced to attempt them. In the case of this _painful_ feeling,\r\nwith which we are here concerned, we are either unwilling or unable to\r\nexplain it in its true way, and are prone to attribute it to malevolent\r\nagencies, often personal--perhaps the \"bogy-man\" remnant of the\r\nchild and race. Such explanation is often an easy escape from truths\r\nunwelcome to our ego--truths which, if recognized, would wound pride\r\nor conscience beyond easy endurance. It requires a man of rare courage\r\nand mental clarity to recognize his particular pain from failure in\r\nadaptation as autogenetic, and to lay it to natural and unflattering\r\ncauses. We prefer, of the two, to accuse the environment rather than\r\nthe organism, especially when the organism happens to be our own. We\r\ntake refuge in a grievance rather than impugn the supremacy of our ego.\r\nIndeed, it seems to be necessary for healthy subjective activity, so to\r\nspeak, that a sort of _imperialism_ of the ego, however circumscribed,\r\nbe maintained. It is the condition _sine qua non_ of the necessary\r\nmeasure of well-being of the individual. It is most reluctantly\r\nrelinquished, and we constantly see the plainest truths immolated that\r\nit be retained. Only in the great self-effacement of melancholia and\r\nin those rare characters who recognize and bear complacently naked\r\ntruths--the _Weltschmerz_ of Goethe--is this well-being renounced.\r\nEven those who are willing to father their own wounded ego still\r\nseek the necessary approbation by reducing its future pretensions\r\nor claims so that they may not be again pained by their failure to\r\nachieve them. They _unhitch_ their wagon from the star. Professor\r\nJames has illustrated this by a fraction showing that our approbation\r\nis determined by our _success_ divided by our _pretensions_. Thus,\r\nsuccess/pretensions = approbation (self-esteem). The quotient may\r\nbe increased by diminishing the _pretensions_ or by increasing the\r\n_success_. James's fraction is as applicable to the moral conduct as to\r\nthe intellectual side.\r\n\r\nWhen we look for the physical equivalent of the mental state which\r\nevokes the \"sense of injury\" we find it in dynamic and toxic states\r\nof the nervous system and their correlation. Certain conditions of\r\nthe individual or environment bring these into special relief. Old\r\nage is one. The querulousness, the sense of abuse or persecution\r\nwhich afflict the aged and often lead them to take refuge in the\r\nmartyr-spirit, are sad examples. The state of fatigue or exhaustion is\r\nanother, and \"neurasthenic\" insanity is only an expression in greater\r\ndegree of the morbid mental action found in fatigue and exhausted\r\nstates.\r\n\r\nThe primary and secondary effects of alcohol or other narcotic\r\nindulgence is another soil in which the \"sense of injury\" easily grows.\r\nThe _habitué_ is notoriously suspicious and irritable, and full of\r\nfictitious grievances and unwarranted persecutory ideas. His attitude\r\ntoward them is that of the paranoiac, vindictive, rather than that\r\nof the melancholiac, humiliated. They swell the army of so-called\r\n\"borderland\" cases of insanity, fretting their friends and puzzling the\r\ndoctor with conduct alternately interpreted as \"cussed\" or \"crazy.\"\r\n\r\nWhere there is bodily disease, acute or chronic, the morbid \"sense\r\nof injury\" is much in play. An intelligent patient, on recovery from\r\na stomach disorder, admitted that whenever her stomach had ached she\r\nwas taken with a violent hatred of her companion with whom she was in\r\naffectionate relation. An ignorant Southern colored woman, who had\r\nrheumatism in her ankle, believed that she had been \"hoodooed,\" and\r\nexplained the pain in her ankle by the presence of a snake, which she\r\nbelieved had been put there by a \"hoodoo.\" She was not insane, the\r\nidea being consistent with her degree of intelligence, training, and\r\nearly environment. Another patient, a sensible, cultivated woman,\r\nwhile suffering from a non-nervous illness, in which she had received\r\nall the consideration that love and money could furnish, believed\r\nherself to have been constantly and deliberately abused. After her\r\nrecovery, now some years, she still maintains the belief. Instances\r\ncould be multiplied, for doctors continually meet this atmosphere in\r\nthe sick-room, from ugly little grievances to delusions of persecution.\r\nThey are not surprised when a patient tells them in mingled confidence\r\nand complaint that he is hungry and neglected, that \"they\" will\r\ngive him nothing to eat, etc., to find that his wife has been most\r\nattentive, has been pressing him to eat, and has stocked the pantry in\r\nanticipation. Dr. Johnson had plenty of ground for saying that a sick\r\nman is a rascal, though the modern doctor has reversed the formula.\r\n\r\nPersons who suffer from actual trouble or ill treatment easily develop\r\na morbid sense of injury, just as under similar conditions they may\r\nbecome insane. Unable to estimate the precise amount of their real\r\ngrievance, there is an easy mental overflow into the fictitious\r\nones. It is for this reason that the narrative of a real trouble or\r\nquarrel is so fraught with calumnious arraignment of others that it\r\nis unreliable until we have heard the \"other side of the story,\" and\r\nthat when disputants meet and explanations follow they often find\r\nthat they have no _casus belli_. In the examination of the alleged\r\ninsane for commitment we have constantly to separate the real from the\r\nimaginary troubles. Mr. F---- was the subject of such examination. He\r\nwas suffering from heart disease, and thereby compelled to remain at\r\nhome idle. His wife was supporting the family by keeping boarders,\r\nand he began to develop a morbid jealousy of her. He annoyed her by a\r\nconstant surveillance and suspicion of her every act, which amounted\r\nat times to the delusion that she was unfaithful to him, and which\r\nculminated one night in an outbreak in which the police figured. It\r\nwas difficult to separate his real from his imaginary grievances, for\r\nhis wife had ceased to have any affection for him, though his delusion\r\nin regard to her unfaithfulness was unfounded and had been grafted\r\nupon his real trouble. Sent to a general hospital, he improved, and\r\nwas reported \"not insane.\" Circumstances requiring a hard struggle\r\nfor existence, disappointment without apparent cause, coupled with a\r\ncertain sentimental cast of mind, often prevent the correct estimation\r\nof the wrongs suffered and the proper relation of undoubted misfortunes.\r\n\r\nIn the insane the sense of injury or its analogue--delusions of\r\npersecution--appears in numerous shapes. Thus patients are defrauded,\r\nor conspired against, or acted upon by witchcraft, magnetism,\r\nelectricity, or poisoned, or preached against, or subjected to\r\ndisagreeable odors. Sometimes the delusions are but ill-defined\r\nand vague. Often it is possible to trace them to their underlying\r\ndisordered sense impression or the particular environment or to\r\nvestiges of outgrown beliefs. They appear in depressed states of\r\nmelancholia as well as in the exalted states of mania and paranoia.\r\nIn melancholia they accompany a feeling of worthlessness which is the\r\npatient's explanation of his persecution--i. e., he is unworthy of\r\nbetter treatment. In paranoia the patient believes the persecution to\r\nbe prompted by fear or envy of him, and there is consequently a feeling\r\nof self-importance--a morbid egotism which is in direct proportion to\r\nthe magnitude or complexity of the ideas of persecution. Indeed, it\r\nis probable that these ideas of persecution, acting on a potentially\r\nmelancholic or a potentially paranoiac mind, whatever these may be,\r\ndetermine the type that these mental diseases take.\r\n\r\nThe difference between the \"injured\" sense in the sane and insane\r\nstates we must from our view point, without essaying to bridge all\r\nthe _terra incognita_ which lies between sanity and insanity, regard\r\nas largely but one of degree. And so with the underlying mental and\r\nphysical states. We find the morbid ideas more fixed in the sane than\r\nin the insane, frequent repetitions of the morbid impression tending\r\nto its final organization, so to speak. We also find that the morbid\r\nidea is usually more elaborated in the insane than in the sane state,\r\nalthough instances of the greatest elaboration are sometimes met with,\r\nespecially where the element of some external foundation is large. It\r\nis probable, however, that the elements of fixity and elaboration of\r\nthe persecutory idea are after all dependent upon and in proportion to\r\nthe intensity of the underlying brain and mind states. In other words,\r\nthat to increase a given intensity of these states is to increase the\r\nfixity and elaborateness of the \"sense of injury,\" is to prevent the\r\ncorrection of the morbid idea, until finally exploited in conduct,\r\nwhich is the _début_ of the insanity.\r\n\r\nThus the relativity of insanity which has all along been maintained is\r\nclear on the line here pursued. It would be equally so in following\r\nother lines of morbid psychology. It has, though, received but little\r\ngeneral recognition, and writers still treat insanity as an entity\r\napart from its bearings on the average mind and its evolutionary\r\nhistory. The word \"insanity,\" or \"lunatic,\" is no doubt largely\r\nresponsible for this, suggesting popularly, as it does, a distinct\r\nclass of persons--a type of being as unlike ourselves as a Martian\r\nmight be fancied to be. Nature or science, however, has set no line\r\nbetween the morbid mental manifestations which constitute sanity and\r\nthose which constitute insanity, that being an arbitrary, however\r\npractical, distinction which science has had rather to descend to\r\nmeet. Nothing so stands in the way of the best welfare of the insane\r\nthan this abysmal ignorance which still prevails in regard to them--an\r\nignorance which still clings to the mediæval idea of insanity, the\r\nclassical portraiture, as in the pictures of Hogarth, or on the stage,\r\nor in fiction; an ignorance which is ever hearkening for the maniac's\r\nshriek or the clanking of his fetters, which recognizes nothing short\r\nof \"furious madness\" as sufficient ground for committing a brain-sick\r\nman to the tender therapy of the hospital ward.\r\n\r\nBut those who know best tell us that the insane are very much like\r\nother people, that there is wonderfully little difference between them\r\nand ourselves; and sometimes but a slight circumstance, a mere accident\r\nof environment, determines which side of the hospital wall we shall be\r\non.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY EXPERIMENTS IN AIR FLIGHT.\r\n\r\nBY M. BANET RIVET.\r\n\r\n\r\nMan has sought in all times and at all places to find means of leaving\r\nthe earth's surface, in imitation of the birds, and rising into the\r\nair. Ancient legendary lore furnishes many stories, like those of\r\nDædalus and his son Icarus, of attempts of this sort. In the fourth\r\ncentury B. C., Archytas of Tarentum, a learned Pythagorean, who has\r\nbeen credited with the invention of the screw, the pulley, and the\r\nkite, according to Aulus Gellius, constructed a wooden dove which could\r\nrise and sustain itself in the air by some mechanism the arrangement of\r\nwhich is not known. Credible accounts exist of an English Benedictine\r\nmonk, Oliver of Malmesbury, in the eleventh century, having tried to\r\nfly by precipitating himself from the height of a tower, with the\r\nassistance of wings attached to his arms and his feet. It is said that,\r\nafter having gone along a little way, he fell and broke his legs. He\r\nattributed his accident to failure to provide his apparatus with a\r\ntail, which would have helped preserve his equilibrium and made the\r\ndescent a gentler one.\r\n\r\nIn the sixteenth century, Leonardo da Vinci first demonstrated that a\r\nbird, which is heavier than the air, sustains itself, advances in the\r\nair, \"by rendering the fluid denser where it passes than where it does\r\nnot pass.\" In order to fly it has to fix its point of support on the\r\nair; its wing in the descending stroke exerts a pressure from above\r\ndown, the reaction of which from below up forces the center of gravity\r\nof its body to ascend at each instant to the height at which the bird\r\nwishes to maintain it. Some sketches that have come down to us prove\r\nthat Leonardo occupied himself, like Oliver of Malmesbury, with giving\r\nman power to fly by the aid of wings suitably fixed to his body. We owe\r\nto Leonardo also the invention of the parachute, which he described in\r\nthe following terms: \"If a man had a pavilion, each side of which was\r\nfifteen braces wide and twelve braces high, he might cast himself from\r\nany height whatever, without fear of danger.\" It may be said, too, of\r\nLeonardo da Vinci, that he was the first to suggest the idea of the\r\nscrew propeller. \"If,\" he said, \"this instrument in the form of a screw\r\nis properly made--that is, made of linen cloth, the interstices of\r\nwhich have been filled with starch--and if we turn it rapidly, such a\r\nscrew will make a bearing nut for itself through the air and rise. This\r\ncan be proved by moving a broad, thin rule rapidly through the air,\r\nwhen it will be found that the arm is forced to follow in the direction\r\nof the edge of the board. The frame for the cloth of which I have been\r\nspeaking should be made of long, stout reeds. A model of it might be\r\nmade in paper, with, for its axis, a thin strip of iron which we twist\r\nforcibly. When the strip is left free it will turn the screw.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1680 Borelli published some studies of a remarkably correct\r\ncharacter on the flight of birds. According to his view, the wing\r\nacts upon the air in the phase of beating down, in the manner of an\r\ninclined plane, so as, by virtue of the resistance opposed by the\r\nair, to push the body of the animal upward at first and then onward.\r\nThe action of the ascending wing was compared to that of a kite, and\r\nit would consequently continue to sustain the body of the bird while\r\nwaiting the following stroke. But Borelli never thought of turning\r\nhis observations to advantage, so as to supply man with the means\r\nof flying. Attention was much engaged in 1742 with the attempt of\r\nthe Marquis de Bacqueville, substantially repeating that of Oliver\r\nof Malmesbury, which was terminated by a similar accident. Mention\r\nshould also be made of Paucton, who in 1768 drafted a plan for a screw\r\nmachine. In 1784 Launoy and Bienvenu exhibited and operated, before\r\nthe Academy of Sciences in Paris, a screw which was moved by a strong\r\nspring. Before this, however, Joseph and Stephen Montgolfier had filled\r\nthe world with the noise of their discovery of the air balloon, and the\r\ningenious machine of these aëronauts failed to receive the attention it\r\ndeserved.\r\n\r\nIt has been known since the days of Archimedes that every body partly\r\nor wholly submerged in a liquid in equilibrium suffers a vertical push\r\nupward from the fluid equal to the weight of liquid it displaces.\r\n\r\nLet us consider the case of a body entirely plunged in a liquid--water,\r\nfor example. If its weight exceeds the thrust it suffers it will fall\r\nto the bottom of the water under the action of a descensional force\r\nequal, at each instant, to the difference between the weight of the\r\nbody, which is invariable, and the thrust, which is invariable also,\r\nand thus constant in direction and also in amount. If the weight of the\r\nbody is less than the thrust, the latter overcomes it, and, contrary\r\nto the usual laws of weight, the body will rise under the action of\r\nan ascensional force, which will evidently be likewise constant in\r\namount as well as in direction. A cork held down at the bottom of a\r\nvessel of water and then left to itself will supply an example of this\r\nascensional movement.\r\n\r\nA third case may be presented--that in which the weight of the body\r\nis equal to the thrust of the water. Weight and thrust are then in\r\nmutual equilibrium. No force invites the body either to descend or to\r\nrise, and it remains balanced in the midst of the liquid, wherever it\r\nhappens to have been placed. This state of indifferent equilibrium is,\r\nhowever, possible only if the weight of the body remains rigorously\r\nconstant. The slightest augmentation of the weight immediately causes\r\nthe body to descend, while the slightest diminution sends it up. From\r\nthis source arise the difficulties that are met in the construction\r\nof submarine boats, when their ascent or descent is obtained by\r\nmeans of air chambers, which are filled with water or emptied of it\r\naccording to the requirements. The equilibrium of these engines is\r\nalways precarious, and this explains why none of them, from that of Van\r\nDrebbel in 1620 to the experiments of Goubet in 1895, have given really\r\npractical results in the matter of stability of immersion.\r\n\r\nWhen Galileo, following Aristotle, had demonstrated the ponderability\r\nof the air, and Torricelli had proved that atmospheric pressure was a\r\nresult of that property, it was immediately thought that the principle\r\ndiscovered by Archimedes might be extended to the air, and Otto von\r\nGuericke gave an experimental demonstration of it by the invention of\r\nthe baroscope.\r\n\r\nFrom this period it seems, then, that the discovery of aëronautics was\r\npossible. If the weight of the volume of air displaced is greater than\r\nthat of the body, the latter should take an ascensional movement in the\r\natmosphere, as a cork does when plunged into water; and it is evident\r\nthat for a body to satisfy such conditions we have only to fill a very\r\nlight envelope with a gas less dense than the ambient air. But the\r\nstudy of gases was still in its infancy in the seventeenth century, and\r\nit required the labors of Mortrel d'Élement and Hales, at the beginning\r\nof the following century, to teach physicists how to collect and retain\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe history of the progress of the human mind shows, further, that the\r\npure and simple acceptance of a scientific discovery is not enough to\r\nmake it produce all the consequences we have a right to expect from it.\r\nIt must, further, impregnating the mind with itself, pass, we might\r\nsay, into the condition of an innate idea. Chemistry, in this very\r\nmatter of the discovery of the weight of the air and of the gases,\r\npresents a striking example of the accuracy of our proposition. The\r\nponderability of the air had been accepted by physicists for a long\r\ntime, while chemists continued to take no account of it, although, as\r\nMendeleef has remarked, no exact idea could be conceived, under such\r\nconditions, concerning most chemical phenomena. It is to the glory of\r\nLavoisier that he first took account of this ponderability and of that\r\nof all the gases as well. When we reflect that it was not till about\r\n1775, or a hundred and fifty years after Galileo, that this illustrious\r\nFrenchman began to set forth those ideas, it is not any wonder that\r\nthe discovery of aërostats was not made till toward the end of the\r\neighteenth century. Lalande was therefore much in the wrong when he\r\nsaid \"it was so simple! why was it not done before?\"\r\n\r\nIt would not be just, however, to refer the discovery of aërostats\r\nsolely to the efforts of the Montgolfiers. Like all inventors, like\r\nLavoisier himself, these brothers, as Figuier has remarked, had the\r\nbenefit of a long series of isolated labors, carried on often without\r\nspecial purpose, by which the elements of their invention had been\r\ngathered up.\r\n\r\nPère Lana, of Brescia, conceived a plan in 1670 for constructing a ship\r\nwhich should sustain itself in the air and move by the aid of sails.\r\nFour copper globes, in which a vacuum had been produced in order to\r\nrender them lighter than the volume of air displaced, were to support\r\nthe ship while the sails propelled it. The scientific conception of the\r\nempty globes was correct, but Père Lana did not think of the enormous\r\ncollapsing force which the atmospheric pressure would exercise upon\r\nthem. The idea of a sail which would give his aërial boat a resemblance\r\nto a vessel driven by the winds was wholly erroneous.\r\n\r\nSixty-five years later, in 1735, Père Galien, of Avignon, gave a\r\nfairly clear expression to the theory of aërostats. Resting on the\r\nprinciple of Archimedes, he maintained that if he could fill a globe\r\nmade of light cloth with a sufficiently rarefied air the globe would\r\nnecessarily possess an ascensional force, which would permit it to lift\r\nitself up in the air with a ship and all its cargo. He proposed to draw\r\nthis rarefied air from out of the upper regions of the atmosphere,\r\ndown from the summits of high mountains, forgetting that the air, when\r\nbrought down to the level of the ground, would contract in volume and\r\nassume the density of the ambient atmosphere.\r\n\r\nIn the condition of ignorance of the properties of gases that existed\r\nin that age, it did not occur, and could not have occurred, to Père\r\nGalien to use other gases than air; no more could he have thought\r\nof employing heat to rarefy the air, for the first not very precise\r\nnotions on the decrease in densities of gases by heat only date from\r\nPriestley. But when Cavendish, in 1765, had fully studied hydrogen\r\ngas, and shown that as it was prepared then it was seven times lighter\r\nthan air, Black was enabled to suggest that by filling a light bag\r\nwith hydrogen the bag would be able to raise a certain weight in the\r\nair. The labors of Cavendish, Black, and the discoveries of oxygen,\r\nnitrogen, and other gases by Priestley, were described by Priestley\r\na few years afterward in the celebrated book on The Different Kinds\r\nof Air--a book which Stephen and Joseph Montgolfier had in their\r\npossession. The two brothers evidently found the germ of their\r\ninvention in it.\r\n\r\nIt is fair to say that the Montgolfiers, who were already known in the\r\nlearned world by their discoveries in the mechanical sciences, had\r\nthought, before they knew of Priestley's book, of a way of imitating\r\nNature by inclosing vapor of water, a gas lighter than air, in a paper\r\nbag, which would be lifted up, the vapor contained in the bag being\r\nsustained in the air like a cloud. But the vapor condensed, and the\r\nweighted balloon shortly fell to the ground. The smoke produced by\r\nburning wood inclosed in a bag gave no better results. After seeing\r\nPriestley's book, they substituted hydrogen for vapor and for smoke,\r\nbut the gas passed through the paper bag, and they gave up this attempt.\r\n\r\nThey then fancied that electricity was one of the causes of the rise\r\nof clouds, and sought for a gas that had electrical properties. They\r\nthought they could obtain it by burning wet straw and wool together.\r\nA box made of silk was filled with this gas, and they had the great\r\nsatisfaction of seeing it rise to the ceiling of their room, and, in a\r\nsecond experiment, into the air. This was in November, 1782.\r\n\r\nFive months previously, Tiberius Cavallo, in England, had repeated\r\nBlack's experiment of filling a paper sack with hydrogen; but, as\r\nthe Montgolfiers had found, the hydrogen leaked through the paper.\r\nCavallo had better success with soap bubbles, which held the gas. His\r\nexperiments stopped here, while the Montgolfiers carried theirs on to\r\npractical success.--_Translated for the Popular Science Monthly from\r\nthe Revue Scientifique._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSKETCH OF EDWARD ORTON,\r\n\r\nLATE STATE GEOLOGIST OF OHIO; LATE PRESIDENT OF THE AMERICAN\r\nASSOCIATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF SCIENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll persons interested in American science were surprised and shocked\r\nat learning of the death, from heart trouble, on October 16, 1899, of\r\nProf. Edward Orton, of the Ohio State University. The event occurred\r\nonly little less than two months after Professor Orton had presided,\r\nwith a simplicity of manner that did not hide but rather heightened\r\nthe traits of vigor in his character, over the meeting of the American\r\nAssociation for the Advancement of Science at his home in Columbus,\r\nOhio. The services he rendered to geology, his long and honorable\r\ncareer as an educator, and his continual and consistent insistence\r\nupon the faithful use of the scientific method well entitle him to\r\nbe remembered as one of the most meritorious of American scientific\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\nEDWARD ORTON was born in Deposit, Delaware County, N. Y., March 9,\r\n1829. He was descended from Thomas Orton, who, born in England in\r\n1613, was one of the fifty-three original settlers and owners of\r\nFarmington, Conn., was of the stock from which most of the Ortons in\r\nthe United States are derived, and represented his town in the General\r\nCourt in 1784. Another ancestor, a grandson of Thomas Orton, was one\r\nof the original purchasers and settlers of Litchfield, Conn., where\r\nhe owned a square mile of land known as Orton Hill, on the south side\r\nof Bantam Lake. Two of the maternal ancestors of the subject of this\r\nsketch fought in the colonial wars, and ten Ortons were soldiers in the\r\nRevolution.\r\n\r\nYoung Edward Orton was taught by his father, the Rev. Samuel G. Orton,\r\nD. D., and received further training preparatory for college in the\r\nacademies of Westfield and Fredonia, N. Y. He entered Hamilton College,\r\nwhence his father had been graduated in 1822, in 1845 as a sophomore,\r\nand was graduated in 1848 in a class among the other members of which\r\nwere the Rev. Dr. Thomas S. Hastings, President of Union Theological\r\nSeminary, New York, and the Hon. F. J. Van Alstyne, afterward Mayor of\r\nAlbany, N. Y., and member of Congress. After his graduation he taught\r\nfor a number of years in academies at Erie, Pa., Franklin, N. Y., and\r\nChester, N. Y., and became, in 1856, Professor of Natural Science in\r\nthe State Normal School at Albany, N. Y. He pursued post-graduate\r\nstudies in chemistry, botany, and other subjects at the Lawrence\r\nScientific School, with Professors Horsford, Cooke, and Gray as his\r\nteachers, and studied theology for a time under Dr. Lyman Beecher, at\r\nLane, and Dr. Edwards A. Park, at Andover Seminaries. While teaching at\r\nChester, N. Y., he was called to Antioch College, Yellow Springs, Ohio,\r\nwhere he took charge of the preparatory department in 1865; was made\r\nProfessor of Natural History shortly afterward, and was made president\r\nof the college in 1872, but retained the office for only one year, at\r\nthe end of which he went to occupy a similar position in the State\r\nUniversity at Columbus.\r\n\r\nWhen the second Geological Survey of Ohio was undertaken in 1869 under\r\nthe charge of Prof. J. S. Newberry, Professor Orton was appointed\r\nan assistant by Governor Rutherford B. Hayes, and was continued by\r\nreappointment by Governor E. F. Noyes. When Professor Newberry withdrew\r\nfrom the survey in 1881, Professor Orton was appointed State Geologist\r\nby Governor Charles Foster, and he was afterward reappointed to the\r\nposition successively by Governors Hoadley, Foraker, Campbell, and\r\nBushnell. He retained the title of State Geologist till his death,\r\nalthough he had not been engaged in any active public work on the\r\nsurvey for a considerable time.\r\n\r\nThe Ohio State University having been established on the basis of\r\nthe grants of land made to the States for colleges under the Morrill\r\nLand-Grant Act, Professor Orton was appointed its president and\r\nProfessor of Geology. He discharged the duties of this office for\r\neight years, or till 1881. But the executive work of the president's\r\noffice was irksome to him, since it grew constantly heavier as the\r\nyoung college expanded, and therefore left him less and less time\r\nfor teaching and research in geology. Being in a measure compelled\r\nto make a choice between the two fields of activity, he chose the\r\nless ambitious position, resigning the presidency, and assuming the\r\nposition of Professor of Geology, which he retained for the remainder\r\nof his life. The geological building of the university is named after\r\nhim--Orton Hall. Besides his work on the Geological Survey of Ohio and\r\nhis participation in the composition of its reports, Professor Orton\r\nprepared, for the Eighth Annual Report of the United States Geological\r\nSurvey, a paper on the New Oil and Gas Fields of Ohio and Indiana,\r\nand another, only recently published in the Nineteenth Annual Report\r\nof the United States Survey, on the Rock Waters of Ohio; a volume for\r\nthe Geological Survey of Kentucky on the Petroliferous Production of\r\nthe Western Part of the State, published in 1891; and a report on\r\npetroliferous productions which is in process of publication by the\r\nGeological Survey of New York.\r\n\r\nIn the paper on the Oil and Gas Fields of Ohio and Indiana the\r\ndiscovery of the supply of those materials, the great value of which\r\nwas only realized in 1884 and afterward, is spoken of as being more\r\nsurprising and anomalous than any similar discovery that had preceded\r\nit, and as a development which experts were hardly more prepared for\r\nthan others. The oil and gas derived from the Trenton limestone in\r\ncertain parts of these States were found to differ from the oil and\r\ngas in the Pennsylvania wells in chemical composition and physical\r\nproperties, in the horizons from which they were obtained, in the\r\nstructural features of the rocks associated with their production,\r\nand, most of all, in the kind of rock that produced them. \"No facts\r\nmore unexpected have ever been brought to light in connection with\r\nthe geology of this country than those with which we are now becoming\r\nacquainted.\" Professor Orton's paper, which fills one hundred and\r\neighty of the large pages of the report of the Geological Survey,\r\nincludes a sketch of the history of the discovery to July, 1887,\r\nwhen it was prepared; a designation of what was known in regard to\r\nthe geological scale and geological structure of the regions within\r\nwhich the new fields are embraced, and the tracing of the chief\r\nfactors that influence or control the productiveness of the oil rock,\r\nwith the description of the special features and boundaries of the\r\nseveral fields and the setting forth of the leading facts and present\r\ndevelopment of these lately found sources of power. Two principal\r\nconditions under which the new oil rock had proved petroliferous on a\r\nlarge scale were found to be porosity, connected with and apparently\r\ndependent on the chemical transformation of the upper portion of the\r\nlimestone, for a number of feet in thickness, into a highly crystalline\r\ndolomite; and a relief resulting from slight warping of the strata,\r\nwhereby the common contents of the porous portions of the Trenton\r\nlimestone had been differentiated by gravity, the gas and oil seeking\r\nthe highest levels, and the salt water maintaining a lower but definite\r\nelevation in every field. Professor Orton found nothing in the new\r\nexperience to make it safe to count the Trenton limestone an oil\r\nrock or a gas rock in any locality, unless it could be shown to have\r\nundergone the dolomitic replacement by which its porosity was assured;\r\nand even in case it had suffered this transformation it would not be\r\nfound a reservoir of gas or oil in an important sense unless some parts\r\nof it had acquired the relief essential to the due separation of its\r\nliquid and gaseous contents.\r\n\r\nThe report on the Rock Waters of Ohio concerns, first, those waters,\r\nchiefly in the northwestern and western part of the State, that are\r\nobtained from a considerable depth as compared with ordinary wells, the\r\nknowledge of which was almost wholly derived from wells drilled in the\r\nsearch for oil and gas, and was necessarily fragmentary and incomplete;\r\nbecause water was not included among the objects of search, but was\r\nconsidered a hindrance and obstruction to be got out of the way as well\r\nas possible; and, second, flowing wells, including only those having\r\nconsiderable head of pressure and those occurring in considerable\r\nareas, all of which belong entirely to the drift. Further, a brief\r\nreview is given of some facts of unusual interest that were developed\r\nin the deep drillings concerning the preglacial drainage system of the\r\npart of the State in question. Indications of old river channels, one\r\nof which seems to have been extensive, were found at several points.\r\nAmong the curious results of these studies was the conclusion, \"seeming\r\nto be already established,\" \"that the Ohio River, as we now know the\r\nstream, is of recent origin, and that the main volume of water gathered\r\nin it at the present time originally flowed across the State to the\r\nnorthward at least as far as Auglaize and Mercer Counties, where it\r\nturned to the westward toward the present lines of Wabash drainage in\r\nIndiana.\" Professor Orton seems to have placed considerable emphasis\r\non the value of a study of the rocky floor of the State, concerning\r\nwhich all we know at present is derived from the revelations of deep\r\ndrillings at haphazard; and he thought it would be a good work for\r\nthe State to make use of all accessible data of this kind at once in\r\nconstructing a model of the rocky floor of the region under review. The\r\ncare and fidelity with which he studied the underground geology are\r\nexemplified in a map attached to the paper on the oil and gas fields,\r\nin which the horizons of the Trenton limestone are indicated and\r\napproximately bounded as they occur by gradations ranging from fifty\r\nto two hundred and fifty feet, from elevations above the ocean level\r\nto one thousand and more feet below. Another contribution of Professor\r\nOrton's which may appropriately be given special notice is his part\r\nof the article on Ohio in the Encyclopædia Britannica, in which a\r\nsuccinct, clear, and comprehensive account of the geology of the whole\r\nState is given, with its salient features delineated so sharply that\r\none may almost conceive from it a definite geological picture of the\r\nregion.\r\n\r\nOf all his scientific work, however, Professor Orton regarded\r\nthe fixing of the order of the coal measures of Ohio as the most\r\nimportant; and he considered the determination of the order of the\r\nsubcarboniferous strata, and particularly of the Berea Grit, as\r\nconstituting a large permanent service to the study of the geology of\r\nthe State.\r\n\r\nAt the recent meeting of the American Association for the Advancement\r\nof Science Professor Orton contributed a special paper on the local\r\ngeology of Columbus, the place of the meeting, in which he dwelt\r\nlargely on the origin of the drift that marks the superficial geology\r\nof the vicinity.\r\n\r\nOf the work he has done for the increase and advancement of knowledge,\r\nthe extent of a part of which we have only faintly indicated by the\r\nmention of a few particular researches, Professor Orton put the highest\r\nvalue on his labors as a teacher, a calling to which he was devoted for\r\nmore than half a century. He found peculiar pleasure in instructing\r\nthe children of the old pupils whom he had taught in his younger days.\r\nHe was actively concerned in the promotion and extension of sanitary\r\nscience, his addresses in that field having been one of the factors\r\nthat led to the establishment of the Ohio State Board of Health. He was\r\nalso greatly interested in the advancement of agriculture.\r\n\r\nA theme on which Professor Orton was fond of dwelling in his public\r\naddresses was the amount and value of what has been accomplished\r\nwithin a comparatively short time in the world's history by the use\r\nof the methods of science. In an address delivered before the alumni\r\nof Hamilton College in 1888 he maintained that we were living in a\r\nrevolutionary period, which is marked by a great advance in knowledge\r\nand a vastly larger control of the forces of Nature; by a large\r\nincrease in freedom of thought and action; by a sudden and remarkable\r\naddition to the mobility of man, accompanied by an unexampled growth\r\nof great cities; and by an incalculable addition to the wealth of\r\nthe world. Accompanying these great changes in the material and\r\nintellectual world were certain moral transformations appearing to grow\r\nout of them. All these advances were ascribed to a movement--a new\r\nmethod of investigating Nature--that began, so far as its particular\r\nand continuous development is concerned, about three hundred years\r\nago, but to which no date or founder's name could be attached. This\r\nnew philosophy thoroughly respected Nature, was humble, patient in the\r\naccumulation of facts and the trial of its theories, comprehensive,\r\nprogressive, and hopeful. It has given us the marvelous increase\r\nof knowledge which especially marks the nineteenth century; it has\r\nimpressed its influence upon all branches of study, and has wrought\r\ngreat improvements in methods and results; and has rendered an immense\r\nand inestimable service to Christian theology, and done much to broaden\r\nand rationalize it and thus to perpetuate and strengthen its hold on\r\nthe world. Finally, the method of science was pronounced \"the best gift\r\nthat God has given to the mind of man.\" A similar train of thought as\r\nto the material aspects is apparent, though in a somewhat different\r\nform, in an address on The Stored (or Fossil) Power of the World,\r\ndelivered in 1894.\r\n\r\nA considerable part of Professor Orton's presidential address at the\r\nlast meeting of the American Association was devoted to a summary\r\nof the conclusions derived from Alfred Russell Wallace's book, The\r\nWonderful Century, that the progress accomplished in the present\r\ncentury far outweighs the entire progress of the human race from the\r\nbeginning up to 1800. In this address, also, the author felicitously\r\nspoke of the scope of the American Association as possibly including\r\nthe whole continent, and its object as the advancement of science, the\r\ndiscovery of new truth. \"It is possible that we could make ourselves\r\nmore interesting to the general public if we occasionally forswore\r\nour loyalty to our name and spent a portion of our time in restating\r\nestablished truths.\" But the discoveries recorded, though often\r\nfragmentary and devoid of special interest to the outside world, all\r\nhad a place in the great temple of knowledge; and the speaker hoped\r\nthat although no great discoveries should be reported this time, the\r\nmeeting might still be a memorable one through the inspiration it would\r\ngive to the multitude of workers in the several fields of science.\r\n\r\nProfessor Orton was a member of several learned societies; was\r\nPresident of the Sanitary Association of Ohio in 1884 and 1885;\r\nreceived the degree of Ph. D. from Hamilton College in 1876, and that\r\nof LL. D. from the Ohio State University in 1881; was elected President\r\nof the Geological Society of America in 1896; and was designated at the\r\nBoston meeting of the American Association, 1898, as president for the\r\nColumbus meeting, 1899.\r\n\r\nIn addition to his interests in science and theology, Professor Orton\r\nwas keenly alive to everything that bore on the history of man on\r\nthis planet. He was long a member of the Ohio State Archæological and\r\nHistorical Society, and had recently been made a member of its board of\r\ntrustees. He was a prominent member of the Old Northwest Genealogical\r\nSociety, and was the author of a volume, published in 1896, on the\r\nGenealogy of the Orton Family in America. The absolute freedom of his\r\ncharacter from any desire for display or self-aggrandizement is well\r\nshown by the fact that in this volume, compiled, with enormous labor,\r\nin the spare minutes of a busy life, he cuts himself off with one\r\nparagraph of a hundred words, while devoting pages to contemporaneous\r\nmembers of the family of whom the world has never elsewhere heard.\r\n\r\nHe was stricken with hemiplegia in December, 1891, but was able to do\r\na considerable amount of work in his profession afterward. A few days\r\nbefore his death he said, in a note, that he felt that he had lived out\r\nhis allotted time, and that his work was done. He never met his classes\r\nagain, though he continued able to be up and about his home till the\r\nhour of his death. He seemed to feel that the solemn event was drawing\r\nclose, during the last two days of his life, and his mind was always\r\nbusy with the great question, \"If a man die, shall he live again?\" He\r\nhad formed an affirmative answer apparently, as he read Browning's\r\nProspice repeatedly in his last hours, and seemed to find in it the\r\ngreatest pleasure and solace. His death was a quiet and painless one--a\r\nfitting end to a beautiful life.\r\n\r\n\r\n Statistics of cremation, presented by M. Bourneville at the recent\r\n annual meeting of the society in Paris, show that the number of\r\n incinerations at the Père Lachaise crematory has almost steadily\r\n increased since 1889, and that the whole number last year was 4,513,\r\n making 37,068 from the beginning. A fair proportion of the number\r\n were women. There are now in Europe and America seventy crematories,\r\n twenty-seven of which are in Italy and twenty in the United States.\r\n Cremation is making good progress in England, where four crematories\r\n are reported from, and two are in course of erection. Germany has six,\r\n where 423 incinerations took place in 1898; Switzerland and Sweden\r\n have two each, Denmark one, and one has been authorized in Norway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEditor's Table.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A COMMISSION IN DIFFICULTIES._\r\n\r\nThe synopsis which has been given to the press of the Thirteenth\r\nAnnual Report of the Interstate Commerce Commission is not encouraging\r\nreading for those who like to believe in legislation as an infallible\r\npanacea for all public and social ills. The tone of the document indeed\r\nis very far from being one of triumph. The note struck in the very\r\nfirst paragraph is the need for more legislation to save the copious\r\nlegislation already passed from proving ineffectual and abortive.\r\nWhether it is that Congress does not wish to make the work of the\r\ncommission successful, or whether it has begun to have a wise distrust\r\nof its own powers, we can not say; but the commissioners complain\r\nbitterly of its inaction. We can not do better than quote their own\r\nwords: \"The reasons for the failure of the law to accomplish the\r\npurposes for which it was enacted have been so frequently and fully set\r\nforth that repetition can not add to their force or make them better\r\nunderstood. It is sufficient to say that the existing situation and the\r\ndevelopments of the past year render more imperative than ever before\r\nthe necessity for speedy and suitable legislation. We therefore renew\r\nthe recommendations heretofore made, and earnestly urge their early\r\nconsideration and adoption.\"\r\n\r\nAs the document proceeds, we see the good commissioners at war with the\r\nwicked railways, and it is impossible to resist the conclusion that, on\r\nthe whole, the wicked railways have the best of it. The commissioners\r\nadmit that certain cases which have come before the courts have been\r\ndecided against them, and in favor of the railways; but they are far\r\nfrom disclosing the full extent of the discouragement, not to say\r\nmortification, they receive. The business of the commission is to\r\ninterfere between the railways and their customers--the public--in\r\nthe interest of the latter. The railways naturally consider this a\r\nrather one-sided function, and are not extremely zealous to aid in its\r\nperformance. They have their own troubles with the public, and have\r\nno commission to come to their assistance. Everybody is after cheap\r\nrailway rates, just as everybody is after cheap goods; and the means\r\nsometimes resorted to to get reductions would at least hold their own\r\nfor astuteness with any that could be concocted in a traffic office for\r\nthe raising of rates. We give the commissioners full credit for doing\r\ntheir best to protect the interests of the public, but we can not help\r\ndoubting whether, on the whole, the public has derived much benefit\r\nfrom their efforts. In fact, we are strongly inclined to the opinion\r\nthat the whole idea of the commission is simply a legislative blunder.\r\n\r\nThe railways undoubtedly possess great powers which theoretically\r\nthere is nothing to prevent their abusing to almost any extent. But\r\nwhat is theoretically possible is not always practically possible.\r\nThe President of the United States possesses great powers, which\r\ntheoretically he might abuse to any extent; so does the Queen of\r\nEngland; so do many other potentates. But of all the evil that is\r\ntheoretically possible, how much is carried out in practice? All kinds\r\nof things _might_ happen if people were fools enough to do all the harm\r\nthat it is in their power to do. The great saving fact is that it is\r\nnot possible to go very far in doing harm to others without doing it\r\nto yourself. It is this fact which the insatiable legislation-monger\r\nignores. He has an infinite faith in the mischief that will happen\r\nif things are left alone. He can not bear to think that somebody is\r\nnot looking after everybody. He has no faith whatever in natural\r\nlaw or natural actions and reactions, and would hoot the idea of\r\nwhat the poet Wordsworth calls a \"wise passiveness.\" Such people\r\nhave little conception of the mischief they do, and of the good that\r\nfails of realization through their pestilent activity. The readers of\r\nDickens will perhaps remember Mrs. Pardiggle and the admirable system\r\nof education she applied to her numerous family of children. The\r\nunhappy youngsters were under orders every hour of the day; they were\r\nmarched round the country with their mother when she went on visits\r\nof charity, and compelled to contribute out of their own (nominal)\r\npocket money to all kinds of religious and benevolent schemes. How\r\nthey kicked and rebelled, and what distressing passions were roused in\r\ntheir youthful breasts, the great novelist has told us; and we think\r\nwe may take his word for it. The fussy legislator is a Pardiggle. If\r\nhe would leave things alone, opposing interests would find a _modus\r\nvivendi_, and practical justice would more and more assert itself.\r\nThe more interference there is between parties who in the last resort\r\nare dependent on one another's good will, the less likely they are to\r\nrecognize their substantial identity of interest. If the interference\r\nis wholly in the interest of one of the parties, the other is sure to\r\nbe forced into an undesirable attitude; while the one whose protection\r\nis the object in view will not unnaturally take all the protection he\r\ncan get, and look for something more.\r\n\r\nWhat is wanted to put the relations between the railways and the public\r\nupon the most satisfactory footing possible is, in the first place,\r\nless legislative interference; and, in the second, a higher tone of\r\nbusiness morality throughout the community. We place this second not\r\nas underrating its importance, but because we believe it would to some\r\nextent flow from the first. It is when the public transfers its right\r\nof eminent domain to a railway corporation that it should take adequate\r\nmeasures to protect its own interests; but how can this be done when\r\nlegislation is sold--when charters are given or withheld, according\r\nto the amount of money available for purposes of persuasion? With\r\nhonest legislators and honest courts there would be very little trouble\r\nbetween the railways and the public, and such as arose could be easily\r\nremedied. Commerce commissions are a testimony to the existence of low\r\nstandards of business morality; and, unfortunately, they tend to keep\r\nthem low, if not to make them lower.\r\n\r\nThe sooner we make up our minds to trust more to moral influences\r\nfreely acting in the intercourse of man with man and of interest with\r\ninterest, and less to legal compulsion, the better it will be for us\r\nin every department of our national life. The Thirteenth Annual Report\r\nof the Interstate Commerce Commission is a virtual confession of the\r\nfailure of legislation to accomplish a purpose which was supposed to\r\nbe easily within its field of action. The confession is coupled with\r\na demand for more legislation, but, were the demand conceded, who can\r\nguarantee that more still would not be wanted? The railways are not at\r\nthe end of their resources, and new laws would, we fear, be only too\r\nlikely to suggest new means of evasion. No; the remedy lies elsewhere,\r\nand if Congress is wise it will give that remedy a trial by allowing\r\nthe railways and the public a chance to arrange terms between them,\r\nwith public opinion as the principal court of appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE FUNCTION OF THE PUBLIC LIBRARY._\r\n\r\nA paper that was read by Mr. Lindsay Swift, of the Boston Public\r\nLibrary, at a meeting of the Massachusetts Library Club, on the subject\r\nof Paternalism in Public Libraries, and which we find in the Library\r\nJournal for November last, is one which, in our opinion, deserves to be\r\nseparately printed and widely circulated. It abounds in good sense, and\r\npreaches a doctrine of self-help and self-reliance which is much needed\r\nin these days.\r\n\r\nA question which the author of the paper does not discuss, but which,\r\nit seems to us, lies at the threshold of the whole subject, is whether\r\nthe very existence of a public library--if we understand by the term a\r\nlibrary supported by public taxes--is not in itself an exemplification\r\nof paternalism. Mr. Swift strikes us as a benevolent bureaucrat who\r\nwants to give the people at large a wider liberty in the matter of\r\nreading than the ruling influences of time and place are disposed\r\nto allow. He sees that liberty is good, that leading strings belong\r\nto infancy, and he raises his protest against a paternalism in the\r\nmanagement of public libraries which, under the plea of providing only\r\nthe most approved reading for all classes, would tend to the repression\r\nof individuality in the reader and the establishment of the supremacy\r\nof commonplace. But what if commonplace insists on being supreme and\r\nshutting out whatever is not of one complexion with itself? How are\r\nwe to resist its demand in the administration of a State-supported,\r\nand therefore majority-ruled, institution? \"You offer us,\" say its\r\nrepresentatives, \"a liberty we do not want for ourselves, and are not\r\nprepared to concede to others, as we are sure it can not be for their\r\ngood. We are not going to consult the tastes of cranks, criminals,\r\nintellectual aristocrats, or social mugwumps of any kind. For all\r\npractical purposes we are the public, and we mean to run this public\r\nlibrary.\" To the objection that a portion, at least, of the taxes is\r\npaid by those whose views and tastes are not going to be consulted, the\r\nanswer would be ready: \"It is for the majority to say how taxes shall\r\nbe applied.\" We recognize the excellence of Mr. Swift's intentions and\r\nsympathize with his way of looking at things, but we feel that his\r\nobjections to \"paternalism\" in connection with public libraries are\r\ndelivered from a somewhat shaky platform. We observe that a periodical\r\nquoted in the Library Journal--the Overland Monthly--makes the remark\r\nthat \"there is nothing to be said for free books that could not be\r\nurged in favor of free beefsteaks and free overcoats.\"\r\n\r\nSome of the points, however, that are made by Mr. Swift are deserving\r\nof attention. The several professions--law, medicine, theology,\r\netc.--would more or less like to have only such books placed upon the\r\nshelves of a public library as represent what may be called their\r\nrespective orthodoxies. But, as Mr. Swift observes, \"libraries are as\r\nmuch the depositories of the folly as of the wisdom of the ages.\" A\r\nlibrary, therefore, should tell us what men have thought and attempted\r\nin the past, and what they are thinking and attempting now. It is for\r\nschools and colleges, for newspapers and reviews, to afford guidance\r\nin the wilderness of opinions, not for the library to make a point of\r\nputting out of people's reach everything that is not in line with the\r\nscientific, literary, or other orthodoxy of the hour.\r\n\r\n\"A subtle form of paternalism is the deliberate inculcation of the\r\npatriotic spirit, especially in children.\" Mr. Swift is a brave man\r\nto attempt to stem this particular torrent. He thinks there are times\r\nwhen one who loves his country would feel shame for it rather than\r\npride, and that the motto \"My country right or wrong\" is not the most\r\nwholesome sentiment that can be impressed on the mind of youth. \"To\r\nfill a child with the consummate virtues of Washington, Jefferson, and\r\nother of our immortals, and to leave him ignorant of the greatness of\r\nCromwell and of William the Silent, is a serious injustice to the child\r\nand to the cause of education.\" Not only is this done, but, in the\r\ndomain of literature as well, it seems as if the only names with which\r\npublic-school pupils obtain any acquaintance are those of national\r\nauthors. So far as poetry is concerned, Mr. Swift says that almost the\r\nonly name he hears from the lips of children frequenting the Public\r\nLibrary is \"Longfellow.\" He can not remember ever having had a call\r\nfrom a child for Tennyson, while Wordsworth in the school region is\r\nequally unknown.\r\n\r\nApart from the studied inculcation of a narrow patriotism, the author\r\nof the paper we are considering thinks that there is altogether too\r\nmuch paternalism shown in the choice of children's reading. He has only\r\na limited and feeble faith in \"children's rooms\" in public libraries.\r\nThey are very much, he thinks, like Sunday schools--convenient places\r\nfor parents to unload their offspring. The aim of the censorship is\r\nto eliminate everything that is not in accord with the most approved\r\ncanons of juvenile life and thought, leaving only what is ready for\r\nimmediate acceptance and assimilation. Such a policy, Mr. Swift holds,\r\nis not favorable either to individuality or to intellectual growth.\r\n\"We must,\" he says, \"take books, like life, as we find them, and learn\r\nto distinguish good and bad; learn, as we ought, that the good is not\r\nso good as we have been told it is, and that the bad contains a strong\r\ninfusion of good. No wrecks are so fearful as those which come to the\r\nyoung who have up to a point led 'sheltered lives.'\"\r\n\r\nIt is not, however, children only who get the benefit of a benevolent\r\nprotective policy. Selecting committees are quite prepared to look\r\nafter grown-up people as well, and keep out of their way books which\r\nmight prove too exciting, which might reveal depths of passion such\r\nas persons leading decorous lives are not supposed to know anything\r\nabout, or otherwise agitate the tranquil mill pond of their existence.\r\nIt does not occur to them that thus the salt and savor of human life\r\nare expelled, and that, instead of the free play of vital forces,\r\nthere supervenes a dreary mechanic round of semi-automatic activities\r\nunvisited by enthusiasm, untouched by strong desire, without dream or\r\nvision or any quickening of the heart or the imagination. Some good\r\npeople are excessively particular not only as to what may threaten\r\nmoral disturbance, but as to anything that may encourage departures\r\nfrom conventional modes of speech and deportment. They do not like\r\nto admit books that they regard as vulgar, and a great mark of\r\nvulgarity in their opinion is the use of slang. Yet so accomplished\r\na _littérateur_ as Mr. William Archer told us lately that he pleads\r\nguilty to \"an unholy relish\" for the talk of \"Chimmie Fadden\" and his\r\nChicago contemporary \"Artie.\" To him, as to Mr. Swift, the books in\r\nwhich these worthies disport themselves _mean something_, and something\r\ndeserving of attention. That being the case, the vulgarity, which is\r\npart of the picture, becomes in proportion to its truth an element of\r\nvalue. Mr. Swift, very bold and like the ancient prophet, says plainly:\r\n\"Harmless books in general are mediocre books; if a new note in morals\r\nor society is struck, the suggestion of a possible injuriousness at\r\nonce arises.\"\r\n\r\nTaken as a whole, Mr. Swift's paper is a strong plea for individualism\r\nand liberty. As such we have felt it a duty to call attention to it,\r\nand we trust that it will in some way obtain a more general circulation\r\nthan can be afforded by the useful, but somewhat technical, columns of\r\nthe Library Journal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFragments of Science.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Longevity of Whales.=--Some light was thrown, a few years ago,\r\nupon the subject of the vitality of whales by finding one of these\r\nanimals in Bering Sea, in 1890, with a \"toggle\" harpoon head in its\r\nbody bearing the mark of the American whaler Montezuma. That vessel\r\nwas engaged in whaling in Bering Sea about ten years, but not later\r\nthan 1854. She was afterward sold to the Government, and was sunk in\r\nCharleston Harbor during the civil war to serve as an obstruction.\r\nHence, it is estimated, the whale must have carried the harpoon not\r\nless than thirty-six years. In connection with this fact, Mr. William\r\nH. Dall gives an account, in the National Geographic Magazine, of a\r\ndiscussion with Captain E. P. Herendeen, of the United States National\r\nMuseum, of cases of whales that have been supposed to have made their\r\nway from Greenland waters to Bering Strait, and to have been identified\r\nby the harpoons they carried. While it is very likely that the whale\r\nreally makes the passage, an uncertainty must always be allowed, for\r\nships were often changing ownership and their tools were sold and put\r\non board of other vessels, and harpoon irons were sometimes given or\r\ntraded to Eskimos. It therefore becomes possible that the animal was\r\nstruck with a second-hand iron.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Solidification of Hydrogen.=--As soon as he was able to obtain liquid\r\nhydrogen in manageable quantities, in the fall of 1898, Mr. James Dewar\r\nbegan experiments for its solidification. The apparatus he used was\r\nlike that employed in other solidification experiments, consisting\r\nof a small vacuum test-tube, containing the hydrogen, placed in a\r\nlarger vessel of the same kind, with excess of the hydrogen partly\r\nfilling the circular space between the two tubes. No solidification was\r\nproduced, and the effort was suspended for a time, while the author\r\nattacked other problems. The experiments were renewed in 1899, with\r\nthe advantage of more knowledge concerning reductions of temperature\r\nbrought about by reduction of pressure. A slight leak of air in the\r\napparatus was observed, which was frozen into an air snow when it met\r\nthe cold vapor of hydrogen coming off, and this leak at a particular\r\npoint of pressure caused a sudden solidification of the liquid hydrogen\r\ninto a mass like frozen foam. An apparatus was then arranged that could\r\nbe overturned, so that if any of the hydrogen was still liquid it would\r\nrun out. None ran out, but by the aid of a strong light on the side\r\nof the apparatus opposite the eye the hydrogen was seen as a solid\r\nice in the lower part, while the surface looked frothy. The melting\r\npoint of hydrogen ice was determined at about 16° or 17° absolute\r\n(-257° or -256° C.). The solid seemed to possess the properties of the\r\nnon-metallic elements rather than of the metals, among which it has\r\nbeen usual to class hydrogen.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Gegenschein.=--Much interest prevails among astronomers at present\r\nconcerning the question of the nature of the _Gegenschein_. This German\r\nword, which means \"opposite shine,\" is applied to designate a small,\r\nsomewhat oblong, bright spot which is sometimes seen in the sky at\r\nnight, nearly opposite the point which is at the time occupied by the\r\nsun on the opposite side of the globe. It is near the ecliptic, but\r\nappears two or three degrees away from exact opposition to the sun.\r\nIt seems agreed that the _Gegenschein_ is not atmospheric, but rather\r\nmeteoric, being a reflection from some collection of meteors. The\r\nproblem set before astronomers is to identify the meteors. A theory\r\nthat they are connected with the asteroidal zone, or mass of meteors\r\nof which the known and numbered asteroids are conspicuous examples,\r\nhas, according to Professor Barnard, \"much in its favor, but there\r\nare objections to the theory which can not easily be reconciled with\r\nthe observed facts.\" Mr. J. Evershed, of Kenley, England, assumes the\r\n_Gegenschein_ to be a tail to the earth, produced by the escape of\r\nmolecules of hydrogen and helium away from the globe in a direction\r\nopposite to the sun--much as a comet's tail is formed. Other observers\r\nsuppose it to be connected with the zodiacal light or band, which is\r\nregarded as a body of meteors connected with the earth and accompanying\r\nit, and is plainly visible in the western sky after sunset in the\r\nspring, rising from the place of the sun toward the zenith; and Mr.\r\nWilliam Anderson, of Madeira, publishes a figure with a demonstration,\r\nin The Observatory, to show how its place and appearance may be\r\naccounted for on this supposition. The _Gegenschein_ has been compared\r\nin a homely way to the radiance which may be seen around the shadows of\r\nour heads cast by the sun upon the dewy grass early on a bright summer\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Literature for Children.=--Mr. Richard le Gallienne, in an article\r\npublished in the Boston Transcript, laments the flood of rubbish that\r\nis poured out under the guise of children's books. The subject of\r\nliterature for children is discussed in the Studies of the Colorado\r\nScientific Society by Prof. E. S. Parsons, who remarks that three\r\nof the greatest classics of childhood were not written for children\r\nat all. \"Pilgrim's Progress was a new type of sermon written by the\r\ntinker preacher in his prison cell at Bedford; Robinson Crusoe was a\r\npseudo-history from the pen of one of the first great English realists;\r\nGulliver's Travels was a political satire by the greatest of English\r\nsatirists. The same thing is true of the stories of the Bible, of the\r\nArabian Nights, of the folklore which strikes a sympathetic chord at\r\nonce in the child's nature.... Child study, then, reveals the fact that\r\nthe child nature is the counterpart of what is best in books--that\r\nchildren can appreciate literature.\" A friend of Professor Parsons\r\nwrote him of her daughter, nine years old, being very fond of her\r\nfather's library, and \"simply devoted\" to the Bible and the plays\r\nof Shakespeare. Harriet Martineau, when a child, \"devoured all of\r\nShakespeare,\" sitting on a footstool and reading by firelight, and\r\nmaking shirts, with Goldsmith or Thomson or Milton where she could\r\nglance at them occasionally. Another of Professor Parsons's friends\r\nread \"all of Goethe's Faust with his little thirteen-year-old girl,\r\nto her great enjoyment,\" and the little girl afterward read alone\r\nall of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales. \"Many teachers have found young\r\nchildren delighted with Dante.\" These incidents and others point to the\r\ninference that it is not necessary to go outside of the world's great\r\nliterature for fit material for a child's imaginative and emotional\r\nnature. One of Mr. Le Gallienne's main conclusions is that it is very\r\nhard to guess beforehand what the child will like.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Geography and Exploration in 1899.=--No great geographical discoveries\r\nwere recorded during 1899, but much good work was done in exploration.\r\nConsiderable interest has been taken in preparing expeditions of\r\nantarctic research, of which a Belgian expedition has returned\r\nwith some important results, and Mr. Borchgrevink has begun work\r\nat Cape Adar, on the antarctic mainland. The search for Andrée has\r\nhelped increase our knowledge of parts of the arctic coast. In Asia,\r\nCaptain Deasy has laid down the whole of the before unknown course\r\nof the Yarkand River, and has furnished other information concerning\r\nlittle-known regions; and other surveys and explorations have been\r\ndiligently prosecuted. About as much may be said of Africa, where \"the\r\nwant of adequate exploration of the mountainous regions on the borders\r\nof Cape Colony and Natal has been only too forcibly brought home\" to\r\nthe English. Expeditions sent out by Canadian surveys are constantly\r\nopening up new countries and producing maps of great geographical and\r\nindustrial value. Mr. A. P. Low finds Labrador not quite so bleak\r\nand hopeless a country as had been generally believed. Sir Martin\r\nConway has done some very creditable exploration in the Andes and in\r\nTierra del Fuego, the scientific results of which are of considerable\r\nvalue. In Chile, Dr. Staffer and his colleagues have been exploring\r\nthe wonderful fiords of the coast and the rivers that come down to\r\nthem from the Andean range. Dr. Moreno has described the results of\r\ntwenty-five years' exploration of the great Patagonian plains, and of\r\nthe lakes and glaciers and mountains on the eastern face of the Andes.\r\nOne of the most important scientific enterprises during the year, the\r\nLondon Times says, was the German oceanographical expedition in the\r\nValdivia, under Professor Chum, which went south through the Atlantic\r\nto the edge of the antarctic ice, and north through the Indian Ocean to\r\nSumatra, and home through the Red Sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Royal Society Medalists.=--The Copley medal was conferred, at the\r\nrecent anniversary meeting of the Royal Society, upon Lord Rayleigh\r\nfor his splendid service to physics, his investigations, the president\r\nsaid in presenting the award, having increased our knowledge in almost\r\nevery department of physical science, covering the experimental as well\r\nas the mathematical parts of the subject. \"His researches, from the\r\nrange of subjects they cover, their abundance, and their importance,\r\nhave rarely been paralleled in the history of physical science.\" A\r\nsummary account of the principal ones was given in the sketch of him\r\npublished in the twenty-fifth volume of the Popular Science Monthly\r\n(October, 1884). At the same meeting of the Royal Society the Royal\r\nmedals were conferred upon Prof. G. F. Fitzgerald, for his brilliant\r\ncontributions to physics, and Prof. William C. McIntosh, for his very\r\nimportant labors as a zoölogist. Professor Fitzgerald's investigations\r\nhave been in the field of radiation and electrical theory, and in a\r\nmanner complementary to those of J. Clerke Maxwell. Among his works is\r\na memoir presenting a dynamic formulation of the electric theory of\r\nlight on the basis of the principle of least action, which concludes\r\nwith a remark upon the advantage of \"emancipating our minds from the\r\nthraldom of a material ether.\" Professor McIntosh was spoken of as \"one\r\nof a distinguished succession of monographers of the British fauna,\r\nwho, beginning with Edward Forbes, have, during the last fifty years,\r\ndone work highly creditable to British zoölogy.\" He is author of a\r\ngreat monograph of the British Annelids, which is still in progress\r\nof publication by the Royal Society, and of an important contribution\r\nto the Challenger reports, and was the founder of the first marine\r\nbiological station in Great Britain--the Gatty Marine Laboratory at St.\r\nAndrews. The Davy medal was bestowed upon Edward Schunck for researches\r\nof very high importance in organic chemistry. These works include a\r\nremarkable series of contributions to the chemistry of the organic\r\ncoloring matters, particularly those relating to the indigo plant and\r\nto the madder plant. Of late years he has studied, with distinguished\r\nsuccess, the chemistry of chlorophyll.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Anglo-Saxon Superiority.=--The question of the superiority of the\r\nAnglo-Saxon race is at present interesting economists of other stocks,\r\nespecially of the supposed Latin races. The fact of superiority\r\nseems to be conceded. The problem is to account for it. A French\r\nwriter, M. Dumoulins, attributes it to the superiority of Anglo-Saxon\r\neducational institutions. Signor G. Sergi, the distinguished Italian\r\nanthropologist, thinks it is a result of the mixture of ethnic elements\r\nof which the English people are made up, and he goes over the history\r\nof the colonizations which have overtaken Britain, to show how upon\r\nthe first neolithic settlers of the Mediterranean stocks came a small\r\nemigration of the Asiatic Aryan or Indo-European peoples. Cæsar's\r\nconquest brought in a Roman infusion with some African elements, which\r\ndid not last long, but left their mark. Next the Anglo-Saxon tribes of\r\nnorthern Germany made the principal contribution to the formation of\r\nthe English people. A portion of Scandinavian blood was added to the\r\ncomposition, and on top of all came the Normans. These elements, none\r\nof which were extremely discordant with the others, became thoroughly\r\nmixed in the course of time, and matured into the English people as it\r\nis. The English resemble the Romans in their methods of colonization,\r\npolitical tact, practical sense, persistence, religious tolerance,\r\nthe magnitude of their works and the boldness of their undertakings,\r\nand in their egotism working together with the principle of social\r\nsolidarity. Both readily established themselves in new colonies,\r\ncarrying there the civilization of the mother country and their systems\r\nof administration. The great roads and wonderful bridges constructed by\r\nthe Romans are paralleled by the great Anglo-Saxon railway systems. As\r\nthe Latin language became almost universal, so the English language is\r\ndiffusing itself everywhere. But Signor Sergi fails to show why, if the\r\nEnglish have taken so much from the Romans, the Italians, their direct\r\ndescendants, have lost so much of what they once had. He reserves that\r\nquestion, after raising it, for future consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Carbonic Acid and Climate.=--The great importance of the carbonic\r\nacid in the atmosphere as a factor in determining the climate of the\r\nearth has been confirmed by the researches of a considerable number\r\nof investigators. Its work appears to be that of an absorbent of the\r\nsun's radiant heat, retaining it and preventing its passing by us and\r\nleaving us in the cold temperature of space. Tyndall computes that it\r\nhas in this capacity a power eighty times that of oxygen or nitrogen,\r\nwhile it is excelled by water vapor with ninety-two times that of those\r\ngases. Lecher and Pretner, on the other hand, believe that carbonic\r\nacid is the only agent concerned in the service. Mr. Cyrus F. Talman,\r\nJr., in view of the fact that carbonic acid is an important factor\r\namong geological agencies, has published, in the Journal of Geology,\r\na study of the conditions of the content of that gas in the ocean, a\r\nstudy that leads to the consideration of the chemistry of the ocean.\r\nIt seems to be clear that with falling temperature the ocean will\r\ndissolve carbonic acid from the air. Dr. T. C. Chamberlin has shown\r\nthat the amount of carbonic acid in the atmosphere at any one time, and\r\ntherefore the climate of the earth at that time, depends upon the value\r\nof the ratio of the supply of the gas to its depletion. Besides the\r\ncontinuous supply that the atmosphere receives from the interior of the\r\nearth and from planetary space and the continuous depletion due to the\r\nformation of carbonates in place of the igneous alkali earth silicates,\r\nthere are variations in the ratio of supply to depletion dependent\r\nupon the attitude of the land and the water. A large exposure of land\r\nsurface is correlated with a rapid solution of calcium and magnesium\r\ncarbonates, which, becoming bicarbonates, represent a loss of carbonic\r\nacid to the atmosphere. On the other hand, the formation of the normal\r\ncarbonate by lime-secreting animals causes a direct liberation of the\r\nsecond equivalent of the bicarbonate. Therefore extensive oceans and\r\nabundant marine life are correlated with warm climate. After a somewhat\r\nmore minute discussion of the action, Mr. Talman concludes that the\r\nocean very greatly intensifies the secular variation of the earth's\r\ntemperature, although acting as a moderating agent in the minor cycles.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Pearl Mussels.=--In his report to the United States Fish Commission\r\non the Pearly Fresh-Water Mussels of the United States, Mr. Charles\r\nT. Simpson speaks of the great variety of conditions under which they\r\nlive. They show great capacity for adaptation. Most of them are found\r\nin shallow water, but certain forms live at considerable depths. Some\r\nbury themselves among the fibrous roots of trees, some in the muddy,\r\nsandy banks just below the surface of the water, and some, as in Lake\r\nTiberias (Palestine) and Lake Tanganyika (Africa), under six hundred\r\nor more feet of water. Ordinarily they die in a very short time if\r\ntaken out of the water--in from twenty-four to forty-eight hours, as a\r\nrule--and they generally die in a few hours when exposed to the sun.\r\nBut many species, thus tender in the open air, will lie buried in dried\r\nmud for a long time. In June, 1850, a living pond mussel was sent to\r\nLondon, from Australia, which had been out of water for more than a\r\nyear. Along a small stream near Braidentown, Fla., which runs only\r\nduring about three months in summer and is dry the rest of the year,\r\nthousands of a large colony of _Unio obesus_ may be found just buried\r\nin the sandy banks or among the flags and rushes of the bottom, where\r\nthere is very little moisture, all in healthy condition. Mr. Simpson\r\nhas laid these mussels in the sun for months without killing them. The\r\nspecimens which live in perennial water seem to die soon if removed\r\nfrom it, while those which inhabit streams or ponds that often dry up\r\nwill live a long time out of water. Some species in rocky streams live\r\nin the crevices of the rocks. In the Big Vermilion River, in La Salle\r\nCounty, Illinois, a swift, rocky stream, the author has found living\r\nmussels that had been so washed about that nearly all the epidermis was\r\ndestroyed. The shells in such streams are usually heavier than those in\r\nmore quiet water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMINOR PARAGRAPHS.\r\n\r\n\r\nProf. Frederick Starr, of the University of Chicago, has made two\r\nexcursions to Mexico for the purpose of establishing the physical types\r\nof the aborigines by means of measurements, photographs, and casts. He\r\nstudied twelve tribes, half of which were almost unknown to science,\r\nand made measurements of more than eleven hundred and fifty men and\r\nthree hundred women. On his last trip he rode one thousand miles among\r\nthe mountains on horseback. In a recent paper in the Open Court he\r\ntakes notice of frequent and curious survivals of pagan belief to be\r\nremarked among these peoples, although they are all supposed to be\r\ndevout Christians. In one instance, which is specially described, an\r\nidol bearing some resemblance to those found among the ruins of the\r\nancient cities occupied a station in the church by the side of the\r\ncrucifix, sharing the honors with the statue of the Virgin on the other\r\nside. Grief and consternation prevailed among the Indians when the idol\r\nwas taken away by the ecclesiastical authorities.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe question of the increase of insanity in England during the last few\r\nyears is regarded as assuming a serious aspect, and the report of the\r\nCommissioners of Lunacy for 1898, showing the largest annual increase\r\nyet recorded, the Lancet says, reveals the gravity of the situation.\r\nOther collateral facts given in the report \"add to the seriousness of\r\nthe outlook.\" The increase in the number of inmates in institutions for\r\nlunatics is attended with a falling off in the recovery rate, which\r\nis lower for 1898 than that of the previous year, and even than the\r\naverage of the last ten years. A steady diminution in the recovery rate\r\nhas appeared also during each period of five years since 1873. The\r\nattempt to account for the increase of lunatics in public and private\r\nasylums by supposing that it is made up by removals thither from\r\nworkhouses or from the care of relatives fails, for it is shown that\r\nthis class of insane is increasing too, though slowly. The subject is\r\nregarded as of so much importance that it was considered and discussed\r\nin the Psychological Section of the British Association at its Bristol\r\nmeeting in 1899.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA process by which calcium carbide can be continuously produced\r\nmore cheaply than by the process at present in use is reported, in\r\nIndustries and Iron, to have been discovered by Professor Freeman, of\r\nChicago. In the new process a huge arc lamp inclosed in brickwork in\r\nthe interior of a furnace is employed. The upper electrode of the lamp\r\nis hollow, and through it is fed a powder composed of common lime and\r\ncoke. This powder, being carried through the upper carbon directly into\r\nthe electric flame, is melted by the intense heat, and molten calcium\r\ncarbide runs away from the furnace. It is estimated that the carbide is\r\nproduced at a cost of half a cent per pound.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES.\r\n\r\nA new method of securing more perfect combustion, described by Mr.\r\nPaul J. Schlicht before the Franklin Institute, is based on the fact,\r\ndescribed by the inventor, that if a current of air is properly\r\nintroduced into a chimney flue through which hot products of combustion\r\nare escaping, it will flow in a direction contrary to theirs, and,\r\nbecoming heated in contact with them, will reach the center of the\r\nfire in a condition highly favorable to the most complete union of\r\noxygen with the combustible elements of the fuel. Suggestions are\r\nmade in Mr. Schlicht's paper for the construction and regulation of\r\nfurnaces, so as to secure the condition described.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. Edward Orton, Jr., has been appointed State Geologist of Ohio, to\r\nsucceed his father, the late Dr. Edward Orton.

H. Schouppe, in a work entitled The Doctrine\r\nof Purgatory elucidated by Facts and Private Revelations. The \"facts\"\r\nconsist of the visions of saints, and the \"private revelations\" prove\r\nto be apparitions of souls in purgatory to hysterical women and other\r\npersons \"blasted with ecstasy.\" The book has been translated into\r\nGerman by a Tyrolese priest, G. Pletl, and just published at Brixen,\r\n\"with the approbation of the Prince Bishop.\" An Austrian journal,\r\nthe Ostdeutsche Rundschau, printed extracts from the volume with\r\nappropriate comments, and was confiscated by the Government in Vienna\r\nfor \"offense to religion.\"\r\n\r\n[9] The manner in which The Pelican makes piety profitable is most\r\nextraordinary and should win the admiration and excite the envy of the\r\n\"yellow press.\" The editor informs the public that he entered into a\r\ncompact with St. Joseph, promising to distribute fifty books in which\r\nthis holy person is glorified, provided the journal receives two\r\nthousand subscribers. In less than a year the number of subscribers\r\nwas twenty-five hundred. A promise to distribute one hundred books of\r\nthis kind, if St. Joseph would procure eight thousand subscribers,\r\nraised the list of subscribers to twelve thousand; and this barter\r\nwent on until The Pelican could boast of ninety thousand subscribers.\r\nThe editor also announces that he has engaged two hundred and eighty\r\npriests to say masses for the readers of his paper and to pray for and\r\nbless their children, and concludes this astounding piece of puffery as\r\nfollows: \"Experience teaches us that the benediction of a single priest\r\nis effective. What, then, can not be obtained if two hundred and eighty\r\npriests unite in blessing us!\"\r\n\r\n[10] _Cf._ Popular Science Monthly, November, 1895, p. 83.\r\n\r\n[11] Studies from the Yale Psychological Laboratory, vol. vi.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES:\r\n\r\n-Obvious print and punctuation errors were corrected.\r\n\r\n-A Table of Contents was not in the original work; one has been\r\n produced and added by Transcriber.\r\n\r\n-Subscripted numbers are rendered with an underscore (e.g. CO_[2] means\r\n that \"2\" is subscripted).",
