JOHN ROSS,\r\n\r\n    In the Clerk’s Office of the District Court of the United States\r\n                for the Northern District of California.\r\n\r\n                     Printed by SPAULDING & BARTO,\r\n            MINING AND SCIENTIFIC PRESS JOB OFFICE,\r\n                    414 Clay Street, San Francisco.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON HURRICANES AND THE LAW OF STORMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Northern Hemisphere, when the Polar and Equatorial currents of\r\nair are alternating with each other, the regular shifting of the wind\r\nround the compass will be through S., S.W., W., N.W., N., N.E., E.,\r\nS.E., S.—and the changes will take place oftener between south and\r\nwest, and between north and east, than between west and north, and\r\nbetween east and south.\r\n\r\nSimilarly in the Southern Hemisphere, it may be inferred that when\r\nPolar currents of air alternate with Equatorial, the regular shifting\r\nof the wind round the compass will be successive through S., S.E., E.,\r\nN.E., N., N.W., W., S.W., S.\r\n\r\nThis is Dove’s “Law of Gyration,” (or the law of the rotation of\r\nwinds). And collecting the main points into a few general propositions,\r\nit may be laid down, that all steady winds are modified by the rotation\r\nof the earth, in such a manner that Equatorial currents of air receive\r\na westerly deflection, and Polar currents an easterly deflection; but\r\nlatitudinal currents suffer no change. The N.E. and S.E. Trade Winds\r\nare steady Polar currents. The Monsoons are alternations of a Polar and\r\nan Equatorial current, twice during the year. Therefore they are N.E.\r\nand S.W. in the Northern Hemisphere, and S.E. and N.W. in the Southern\r\nHemisphere.\r\n\r\nThe S.W. passage winds of the Northern Hemisphere, and the N.W. passage\r\nwinds of the Southern Hemisphere, are Equatorial currents.\r\n\r\nBodies of air set in motion from a state of rest, turn the wind-vane in\r\nthe direction of the meridian as follows:\r\n\r\nThe Polar current in the Northern Hemisphere from N. to E.\r\n\r\nThe Polar current in the Southern Hemisphere from S. to E.\r\n\r\nThe Equatorial current in the Northern Hemisphere from S. to W.\r\n\r\nThe Equatorial current in the Southern Hemisphere from N. to W.\r\n\r\nIn general the winds in the Northern Hemisphere are as follows:\r\n\r\nThose from N. to E. the Polar currents.\r\n\r\nThose from E. to S. the transition of the Polar to the Equatorial.\r\n\r\nThose from S. to W. the Equatorial current.\r\n\r\nThose from W. to N. the transition of the Equatorial to the Polar.\r\n\r\nAlso, in the Southern hemisphere, the winds are as follows:\r\n\r\nThose from S. to E. the Polar currents.\r\n\r\nThose from E. to N. the transition of the Polar to the Equatorial.\r\n\r\nThose from N. to W. the Equatorial current.\r\n\r\nThose from E. to S. the transition of the Equatorial to the Polar.\r\n\r\nThus, a complete revolution of the wind-vane in the Northern Hemisphere\r\nis therefore S.W., N.E., S. with the sun, and in the Southern Hemisphere\r\nthe rotation is S.E., N.W., S., with the sun, also, in that region.\r\n\r\nWhen the course of a steady wind is obstructed in such a manner as to\r\nproduce a Hurricane, or Cyclone, the wind has a rotary or whirling\r\nmotion (as it were, on an axis), while the storm itself has a\r\nprogressive motion.\r\n\r\nN. B.—The rotation of the wind during a hurricane, in the Northern\r\nHemisphere, is in a direction contrary to that in which the hands of a\r\nwatch move. In the Southern Hemisphere, the rotation is in the same\r\ndirection as that of the hands of a watch. And hence the following\r\nshiftings of the vane: In the Northern Hemisphere, when the vortex\r\n(or center) of the storm passes to the westward of the place of\r\nobservation, the rotation is S.W., N.E., S., with the sun; when the\r\nvortex passes to the eastward of the place of observation, the rotation\r\nis S.E., N.W., S., against the sun.\r\n\r\nIn the Southern Hemisphere, if the vortex passes to the westward of the\r\nplace of observation, the rotation is S.E., N.W., S., with the sun.\r\n\r\nIf the vortex passes to the eastward of the place of observation, the\r\nrotation is S.W., N.E., S., against the sun.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Hurricanes or Cyclones.\r\n\r\nThus, in both Hemispheres, the passage of an equatorial whirlwind\r\nstorm on the west side of the place of observation produces normal\r\nrevolutions in accordance with the law of gyration; while, on the other\r\nhand, its passage on the east side produces anomalous revolutions\r\ncontrary to the law of gyration. When the vortex of a whirlwind storm\r\npasses over the place of observation, the vane may shift from one\r\ndirection to that immediately opposite to it.\r\n\r\nGenerally, if the whirlwind storm is an equatorial one in the Northern\r\nHemisphere, it progresses from S.E. to N.W. in the Torrid Zone; it\r\nrecurves at the outer edge of the N.E. trade wind, and thence moves\r\nfrom S.W. to N.E. But in the Southern Hemisphere an equatorial storm\r\nmoves first from N.E. to S.W.; recurves at the outer edge of the S.E.\r\ntrade wind, and then advances from N.W. to S.E.—bearing in mind\r\nthe direction of the rotation of the wind in each hemisphere, viz:\r\nagainst watch hands in the Northern, but with watch hands in the\r\nSouthern Hemisphere. Certain portions of the storms are characterized\r\nby certain hurricane winds, and dividing the storm by diameters drawn\r\nfrom the northern to the southern margin, and again from the eastern\r\nto the western margin, we find that in the Northern Hemisphere, on the\r\nnorthern margin, the wind will be easterly; on the eastern margin,\r\nsoutherly; on the southern margin, westerly; and on the western margin,\r\nnortherly;—each portion of the cyclone possessing its appropriate wind.\r\n\r\nThe relations of the winds to the margin in the Southern Hemisphere,\r\nwill be exactly the reverse of their relation in the Northern. Thus: It\r\nis the southern margin of the storm south of the Equator, that exhibits\r\nan easterly; the western margin a southerly; the northern margin a\r\nwesterly, and the eastern margin a northerly wind. Hence, each portion\r\nof the hurricane having its appropriate wind, there results, according\r\nto the law of the rotation of revolving gales, a very simple rule for\r\ndetermining the bearing of the center of the storm from the ship, viz:\r\nLook to the wind’s eye and set its bearing by compass, the _eighth_\r\npoint to the right thereof when in the Northern Hemisphere; but to the\r\nleft of the wind’s direction when in the Southern Hemisphere, will be\r\nthe bearing of the storm’s center. Thus, in the Northern Hemisphere,\r\nfrom an easterly wind, which characterizes the northern margin of the\r\nstorm, its center will bear south; from a northerly wind the center\r\nwill bear east; from a westerly wind it will bear north, and from a\r\nsoutherly wind, west. But in the Southern Hemisphere, from an easterly\r\nwind, the center of the storm bears north; from a southerly wind the\r\ncenter bears east; from a westerly wind, south; and from a northerly\r\nwind, west.\r\n\r\nThe above rule is perfectly clear and definite; but as it is especially\r\nimportant to avoid the center of the storm,—its most dangerous\r\npart,—the following table shows at a glance its relative bearing in\r\neach Hemisphere.\r\n\r\n  ═════════════════════════════════╦══════════════════════════════════\r\n     IN THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE.   ║   IN THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE.\r\n  ─────────────┬───────────────────╫─────────────┬────────────────────\r\n   If the wind │ The center of the ║ If the wind │ The center of the\r\n        be—    │   storm will bear ║      be—    │   storm will bear\r\n               │   from the ship—  ║             │  from the ship—\r\n  ─────────────┼───────────────────╫─────────────┼────────────────────\r\n   North.      │    East.          ║   North.    │    West.\r\n   N by E      │    E by S         ║   N by E    │    W by N\r\n   NNE         │    ESE            ║   NNE       │    WNW\r\n   NE by N     │    SE by E        ║   NE by N   │    NW by W\r\n   NE          │    SE             ║   NE        │    NW\r\n   NE by E     │    SE by S        ║   NE by E   │    NW by N\r\n   ENE         │    SSE            ║   ENE       │    NNW\r\n   E by N      │    S by E         ║   E by N    │    N by W\r\n   East.       │    South.         ║   East.     │    North.\r\n   E by S      │    S by W         ║   E by S    │    N by E\r\n   ESE         │    SSW            ║   ESE       │    NNE\r\n   SE by E     │    SW by S        ║   SE by E   │    NE by N\r\n   SE          │    SW             ║   SE        │    NE\r\n   SE by S     │    SW by W        ║   SE by S   │    NE by E\r\n   SSE         │    WSW            ║   SSE       │    ENE\r\n   S by E      │    W by S         ║   S by E    │    E by N\r\n   South.      │    West.          ║   South.    │    East.\r\n   S by W      │    W by N         ║   S by W    │    E by S\r\n   SSW         │    WNW            ║   SSW       │    ESE\r\n   SW by S     │    NW by W        ║   SW by S   │    SE by E\r\n   SW          │    NW             ║   SW        │    SE\r\n   SW by W     │    NW by N        ║   SW by W   │    SE by S\r\n   WSW         │    NNW            ║   WSW       │    SSE\r\n   W by S      │    N by W         ║   W by S    │    S by E\r\n   West.       │    North.         ║   West.     │    South.\r\n   W by N      │    N by E         ║   W by N    │    S by W\r\n   WNW         │    NNE            ║   WNW       │    SSW\r\n   NW by W     │    NE by N        ║   NW by W   │    SW by S\r\n   NW          │    NE             ║   NW        │    SW\r\n   NW by N     │    NE by E        ║   NW by N   │    SW by W\r\n   NNW         │    ENE            ║   NNW       │    WSW\r\n   N by W      │    E by N         ║   N by W    │    W by S\r\n  ─────────────┴───────────────────╨─────────────┴────────────────────\r\n\r\nThe path which the axis of rotation describes is not inappropriately\r\ntermed the “Axis Line.” On the “Axis Line” there is no change of wind\r\nuntil the center has passed, when, after a brief interval of calm, the\r\nwind springs up with great fury from the opposite quarter.\r\n\r\nIt has been remarked by Piddington, “that he who watches his barometer,\r\nwatches his ship.” This invaluable instrument, if well understood,\r\ninvariably announces the approach of a revolving storm; shows whether\r\nthe vessel is plunging into the vortex, or if she be receding from\r\nit; and hence, by carefully noticing its indications, the disastrous\r\nconsequences of a hurricane may, to a great extent, be avoided,—for\r\nthe laws of its oscillations are very distinctly marked. The barometer\r\noften stands unusually high before the commencement of a cyclone, and\r\nfrequently (if not always) just around the storm. And conceiving the\r\ncyclone to be divided into two parts by a diameter at right angles\r\nto its path, it may be noted that the barometer always falls during\r\nthe passage of the advancing semi-circle of a revolving storm. The\r\nbarometer always rises during the passage of the receding semi-circle\r\nof a revolving storm. In cases of manɶuvering to take advantage of the\r\nhurricane winds, and to keep just within the verge of the storm, the\r\nbarometer is of signal benefit,—it should be kept as high as possible,\r\nwithout losing the wind. In whatever position the ship may be, the\r\nrising of the mercury announces that the first (or dangerous) half of\r\nthe storm has passed.\r\n\r\nThe barometer is a faithful guide in the zone of the Trade Winds.\r\nIts ordinary variations are so small that any deviation from its\r\nnormal height requires attention. Its fluctuations are larger beyond\r\nthe Tropics; but the indications are scarcely less certain if used\r\nin conjunction with the thermometer and hygrometer,—hence, more\r\nwatchfulness is required on the part of the navigator; and it is of the\r\nutmost importance to have such a knowledge of the Law of Storms, of\r\nstorm instruments, and of the signs of the weather, as to be able to\r\ndetect the presence of a hurricane or cyclone, when as yet sky and sea\r\nbetoken but little of that blind fury, during the height of which it is\r\nso difficult to guide the vessel in safety. One great advantage of such\r\nknowledge is a quick apprehension of the indications which forewarn, to\r\nmake all snug in time.\r\n\r\nThe meteorological signs indicating the approach of a hurricane or\r\ncyclone, have been collected from various sources by Mr. Birt, and are\r\nenumerated and classed according as the phenomena may be presented to\r\nthe external sensations of feeling, sight, or hearing.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETEOROLOGICAL SIGNS RECOGNIZED BY THE FEELINGS.\r\n\r\n   1. A sultry, oppressive state of the atmosphere.\r\n   2. A calm.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETEOROLOGICAL SIGNS RECOGNIZED BY THE EYE.\r\n\r\n   1. A remarkably clear state of the atmosphere, so that the stars\r\n      may be seen to rise and set with nearly the same distinctness as\r\n      the sun and moon.\r\n\r\n   2. A peculiar white appearance in the zenith, more or less of a\r\n      circular form.\r\n\r\n   3. A remarkably red or fiery appearance of the sky. This is not\r\n      unfrequently of such intensity as to tinge all the surrounding\r\n      objects with a deep crimson; and when this is seen there can be no\r\n      question that the violent portion of the cyclone is not far from\r\n      the vessel. When this red light is seen at night, the impression\r\n      on the seaman’s mind is that day has broken before its time.\r\n\r\n   4. A peculiar coloring of the clouds, more especially of an olive\r\n      green. This is generally the precursor of a most violent and\r\n      terrific hurricane.\r\n\r\n   5. A thick, hazy appearance in that quarter of the horizon in\r\n      which the cyclone is raging.\r\n\r\n   6. A remarkable and peculiar appearance of the heavenly bodies.\r\n      When shining through a haze they are said to shine with a pale,\r\n      sickly light, and are not unfrequently surrounded by rings of\r\n      light, or halos. Some observers describe the stars “as looking\r\n      big, with burs about them”; others speak of their “dancing,” and\r\n      generally they have been noticed as being remarkably bright and\r\n      twinkling.\r\n\r\n   7. The sun, on some occasions, has exhibited a blue appearance,\r\n      and white objects have been seen of a decided light blue color.\r\n      The sun has also been observed of a pale and somewhat similar\r\n      appearance to that of the full moon.\r\n\r\n   8. A dense, heavy bank of cloud in the direction of the hurricane.\r\n\r\n   9. A peculiar appalling appearance in this bank, more particularly\r\n      as if it were a solid wall, drawing down upon and closing around\r\n      the ship.\r\n\r\n  10. A darting forward of portions of this bank, as if torn\r\n      into rags and shreds by some violent force, and driven before,\r\n      not borne, by the wind. When this indication\r\n      is distinctly recognized, a run of about two hours toward the\r\n      center will involve the vessel in a destructive hurricane.\r\n  11. A peculiar motion exhibited by small bodies, as branches\r\n      of trees when agitated by the wind, consisting of an apparent\r\n      whirling, not a bending forward, as if bent by a stream of air.\r\n\r\n  12. Lightning of a remarkable columnar character, shooting up in\r\n      stalks from the horizon with a dull glare; also like flashes from\r\n      a gun, and sparks from a flint and steel.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETEOROLOGICAL SIGNS RECOGNIZED BY THE EAR.\r\n\r\n   1. A distant roar (probably of the hurricane itself) as of wind\r\n      rushing through a hollow vault.\r\n\r\n   2. A peculiar moaning of the wind, indicative of the close\r\n      proximity of the violent portion of the hurricane.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE METEOROLOGICAL PHENOMENA ACCOMPANYING A REVOLVING STORM\r\nMAY ALSO BE ENUMERATED THUS:\r\n\r\n   1. A very rapid motion of the air constituting the hurricane, and\r\n      increasing in velocity as the center is approached.\r\n\r\n   2. A fitful variation of intensity in the force of the wind, which\r\n      sometimes blows with fearful violence, carrying away everything\r\n      that opposes its progress; then sinking to a gentle breeze, or\r\n      even lulling to a calm, but almost immediately afterwards\r\n      springing up with greater violence than before. The hurricane\r\n      winds are nearly if not entirely, without exception, puffy,\r\n      violent, and blowing in gusts.\r\n\r\n   3. An immense condensation of aqueous vapor, forming large banks\r\n      of cloud, which precipitate torrents of rain. The condensation\r\n      appears to be so exceedingly rapid that large quantities of\r\n      electricity are generally developed, giving rise to incessant\r\n      flashes of lightning.\r\n\r\n   4. A general darkness, and gloominess within the area of the cyclone,\r\n      relieved only by the fitful glare of the lightning, or the\r\n      appearance of the imperfect circle of light near the center or\r\n      axis of the storm.\r\n\r\n   5. A separation of the clouds in or near the center of the hurricane,\r\n      so as to produce in the immediate neighborhood of the axis a clear\r\n      sky, through which the sun and stars are often seen with great\r\n      brilliancy.\r\n\r\n   6. A calm in the center of the cyclone.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDICATIONS OF APPROACHING OR EXISTING HURRICANES, MANIFESTED BY THE\r\nOCEAN, OF ESPECIAL UTILITY TO VESSELS AT ANCHOR IN ROADSTEADS.\r\n\r\n   1. A swell, produced by the storm-wave, rolling in upon the shore,\r\n      at first of a gentle character. The direction of this swell will\r\n      pretty surely indicate the bearing of the storm, and its changes\r\n      will point out in some localities the course the hurricane may be\r\n      pursuing.\r\n\r\n   2. A swell rolling in, without changing its direction, may be\r\n      regarded as indicative of a hurricane approaching the shore.\r\n      The same phenomenon met with at sea (the ship’s course being\r\n      taken into account) will indicate the bearing down of the\r\n      cyclone on the vessel.\r\n\r\n   3. A dirty green appearance of the ocean; on some occasions its\r\n      assuming a muddy or brown color, on others its being remarkably\r\n      clear, its temperature increasing, and its swellings stronger\r\n      than at other times,—are all indications of the proximity of\r\n      a cyclone.\r\n\r\nThe area over which these rotary storms have been known to expand,\r\nvaries from 30 to 40 to 1,000 miles; but while the diameter, so long\r\nas the storm is within the tropics, expands but very gradually, it\r\nsuddenly increases in a remarkable manner after recurving. The rate at\r\nwhich they travel on their onward course also varies greatly, not only\r\nin different parts of the globe, but even in the same locality, and\r\nat the same season. Generally, however, the rapidity with which the\r\nvortex of the hurricane progresses is greater as the storm recurves\r\non reaching the outer edge of the trade winds. Thus, the hurricane of\r\nAugust, 1853, traversed 6,276 English miles in about twelve days, with\r\na mean progressive velocity of twenty-six miles per hour; but after it\r\narrived at the Banks of Newfoundland this velocity was increased to\r\nabout fifty miles per hour.\r\n\r\nWithin the area of the cyclone the moving body of air frequently\r\nattains a rotatory velocity of from seventy to one hundred miles\r\nan hour.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE SHOWING THE DIFFERENT MONTHS OF THE YEAR IN WHICH HURRICANES AND\r\nCYCLONES HAVE BEEN RECORDED IN VARIOUS REGIONS.\r\n\r\n  ══════════════════════╤═══╤═══╤═══╤═══╤═══╤═══╤═══╤═══╤═══╤═══╤═══╤═══\r\n          LOCALITY.     │Jan│Feb│Mar│Apr│May│Jun│Jul│Aug│Sep│Oct│Nov│Dec\r\n  ──────────────────────┼───┼───┼───┼───┼───┼───┼───┼───┼───┼───┼───┼───\r\n                        │   │   │   │   │   │   │   │   │   │   │   │\r\n  No. Atlantic and W.I. │ 5 │ 7 │ 11│ 6 │ 5 │ 10│ 42│ 96│ 80│ 69│ 17│ 7\r\n                        │   │   │   │   │   │   │   │   │   │   │   │\r\n  South’n Indian Ocean  │   │   │   │   │   │   │   │   │   │   │   │\r\n    & Mauritius.        │ 9 │ 15│ 15│ 8 │ 4 │   │   │   │ 1 │ 1 │ 4 │ 6\r\n                        │   │   │   │   │   │   │   │   │   │   │   │\r\n  North’n Indian Ocean; │   │   │   │   │   │   │   │   │   │   │   │\r\n    Bay of Bengal—      │   │   │   │   │   │   │   │   │   │   │   │\r\n      N.E.

In the North Atlantic, from June to November, the greater number\r\n      occurring in July, August, September, and October.\r\n\r\n   2. In the Bay of Bengal they are most prevalent in October, November\r\n      and December, when the N. E. Monsoon is strongest; they occur also\r\n      during the S. W. Monsoon, especially in April, May or June.\r\n\r\n   3. In the Arabian Sea they have been experienced during both\r\n      Monsoons.\r\n\r\n   4. In the China Sea they are prevalent on the coast between June and\r\n      October; but in the central part of that sea during September,\r\n      October and November.\r\n\r\n   5. In the Southern Indian Ocean they may be expected between November\r\n      and April, but they are most prevalent during January, February\r\n      and March.\r\n\r\n   6. In the Java Sea, and on the N. W. Coast of Australia they have\r\n      been recorded during December, January and February.\r\n\r\n\r\nRULES FOR TRIMMING THE SHIP IN A HURRICANE.\r\n\r\nPiddington long ago said: “That all positive rules tend to mislead.”\r\nEvery ship must have its own peculiar management depending on the four\r\ngreat elements of the problem, which are—\r\n\r\n   1. The ship and her sea room.\r\n\r\n   2. The track of the cyclone.\r\n\r\n   3. Its rate of traveling.\r\n\r\n   4. The ship’s run and drift.\r\n\r\nWhile, on the part of the commander, caution and watchfulness are\r\nessentially requisite, still all the circumstances being favorable,\r\nrules may be given in a very brief compass for trimming a vessel to\r\nthe hurricane winds. These are embodied in the following tables. Where\r\nthe directions of the wind vane, as set down in the first column are\r\ntangents to the whirlwind in its course, these indicate the quarter\r\nfrom which the storm sets in. The points of the compass in the second\r\ncolumn show the position of the storm’s center as regards the vessel.\r\nThe fourth column gives the direction in which to steer when the wind\r\nshifts as indicated in the third column; but if it shifts as indicated\r\nin the fifth column, then bear away as told in the sixth column.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    I.—FOR THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE.\r\n\r\n  ═════════════════╤═══════════╤═════════════╤════════╤══════════════╤══\r\n  Direction of wind│  If the   │And the wind │        │ But if the   │\r\n    at commencem’t │  center   │ shifts from │ Steer  │ wind shifts  │\r\n      of storm     │(or vortex)│             │        │     from     │\r\n                   │   Bears   │             │        │              │\r\n  ─────────────────┼───────────┼─────────────┼────────┼──────────────┼──\r\n  North.           │ East.     │ N to W      │ South. │ N to E       │\r\n  N by E           │ E by S    │ N by E to N │ S by W │ N by E to E  │\r\n  NNE              │ ESE       │ NNE to N    │ SSW    │ NNE to E     │\r\n  NE by N          │ SE by E   │ NE by N to N│ SW by S│ NE by N to E │\r\n  NE               │ SE        │ NE to N     │ SW     │ NE to E      │\r\n  NE by E          │ SE by S   │ NE by E to N│ SW by W│ NE by E to E │ †\r\n  ENE              │ SSE       │ ENE to N    │ WSW    │ ENE to E     │\r\n  E by N           │ S by E    │ E by N to N │ W by S │ E by N to E  │ †\r\n  East.            │ South.    │ E to N      │ West.  │ E to S       │\r\n  E by S           │ S by W    │ E by S to E │ W by N │ E by S to S  │ †\r\n  ESE              │ SSW       │ ESE to E    │ WNW    │ ESE to S     │\r\n  SE by E          │ SW by S   │ SE by E to E│ NW by W│ SE by E to S │ †\r\n  SE               │ SW        │ SE to E     │ NW     │ SE to S      │\r\n  SE by S          │ SW by W   │ SE by S to E│ NW by N│ SE by S to S │ †\r\n  SSE              │ WSW       │ SSE to E    │ NNW    │ SSE to S     │\r\n  S by E           │ W by S    │ S by E to E │ N by W │ S by E to S  │\r\n  South.           │ West.     │ S to E      │ North. │ S to W       │\r\n  S by W           │ W by N    │ S by W to S │ N by E │ S by W to W  │\r\n  SSW              │ WNW       │ SSW to S    │ NNE    │ SSW to W     │\r\n  SW by S          │ NW by W   │ SW by S to S│ NE by N│ SW by S to W │\r\n  SW               │ NW        │ SW to S     │ NE     │ SW to W      │\r\n  ─────────────────┴───────────┴─────────────┴────────┴──────────────┴──\r\n\r\n Transcriber’s Note:\r\n    † † † † † stands for:\r\n    “Put the ship on the Starboard Tack.”\r\n     Printed vertically in 6th column.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.—FOR THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE.\r\n\r\n  ═════════════════╤═══════════╤═════════════╤════════╤═════════════╤══\r\n  Direction of wind│  If the   │And the wind │        │But if the   │\r\n    at commencem’t │  center   │ shifts from │ Steer  │ wind shifts │\r\n      of storm     │(or vortex)│             │        │     from    │\r\n                   │   Bears   │             │        │             │\r\n  ─────────────────┼───────────┼─────────────┼────────┼─────────────┼──\r\n  South.           │ East.     │ S to W      │ North. │ S to E      │\r\n  S by E           │ E by N    │ S by E to S │ N by W │ S by E to E │\r\n  SSE              │ ENE       │ SSE to S    │ NNW    │ SSE to E    │\r\n  SE by S          │ NE by E   │ SE by S to S│ NW by N│ SE by S to E│\r\n  SE               │ NE        │ SE to S     │ NW     │ SE to E     │\r\n  SE by E          │ NE by N   │ SE by E to S│ NW by W│ SE by E to E│ †\r\n  ESE              │ NNE       │ ESE to S    │ WNW    │ ESE to E    │\r\n  E by S           │ N by E    │ E by S to S │ W by N │ E by S to E │ †\r\n  East.            │ North.    │ E to S      │ West.  │ E to N      │\r\n  E by N           │ N by W    │ E by N to E │ W by S │ E by N to N │ †\r\n  ENE              │ NNW       │ ENE to E    │ WSW    │ ENE to N    │\r\n  NE by E          │ NW by N   │ NE by E to E│ SW by W│ NE by E to N│ †\r\n  NE               │ NW        │ NE to E     │ SW     │ NE to N     │\r\n  NE by N          │ NW by W   │ NE by N to E│ SW by S│ NE by N to N│ †\r\n  NNE              │ WNW       │ NNE to E    │ SSW    │ NNE to N    │\r\n  N by E           │ W by N    │ N by E to E │ S by W │ N by E to N │\r\n  North.           │ West.     │ N to E      │ South. │ N to W      │\r\n  N by W           │ W by S    │ N by W to N │ S by E │ N by W to W │\r\n  NNW              │ WSW       │ NNW to N    │ SSE    │ NNW to W    │\r\n  NW by N          │ SW by W   │ NW by N to N│ SE by S│ NW by N to W│\r\n  NW               │ SW        │ NW to N     │ SE     │ NW to W     │\r\n  ─────────────────┴───────────┴─────────────┴────────┴─────────────┴──\r\n\r\n Transcriber’s Note:\r\n    † † † † † stands for:\r\n    “Put the ship on the Starboard Tack.”\r\n     Printed vertically in 6th column.\r\n\r\n\r\nADMIRAL FITZROY’S INSTRUCTIONS ON THE USE OF THE BAROMETER IN NORTH\r\nLATITUDE.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BAROMETER RISES:\r\n\r\nFor northerly wind (including from N.

I consider it the best\r\n  Pump I have ever seen, as to the steady and large volume of water\r\n  delivered, its simplicity, and great labor saved, which is the\r\n  desideratum on ship board. No clapper getting off. No packing. No\r\n  drawing of boxes to clear the clapper, and placed below freezing\r\n  point. As to force and head pumps on board ship, it cannot be\r\n  equalled. _It is the pump_. My opinion is based upon\r\n _over half a century’s_ experience on shipboard.\r\n\r\n                                                        JOHN DEVEREUX,\r\n                                             Surveyor American Lloyds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         =THE CALIFORNIA=\r\n                        =Dry Dock Company=,\r\n\r\n                    San Francisco, California, U.

How extended\r\n   the terrible disease of Seminal Weakness is, no one but the practical\r\n   specialist, who devotes his time to its treatment can tell; but its\r\n   presence can be detected by the most inexperienced by noting the\r\n   following symptoms: _Weakness of the back and limbs; languishing\r\n   feelings; loss of muscular power; nervousness; irritability; cold\r\n   feet and hands, accompanied by hot head; symptoms of consumption;\r\n   short breath; flushings of the face; aversion in society; confusion\r\n   of the mind; loss of memory; nightly emissions; colorless, slight\r\n   discharges upon the least excitement; palpitation of the heart;\r\n   irregular appetite; variable temper, etc., etc_.\r\n\r\n                        =To the Afflicted=\r\n   there is hope and certainty of relief and cure. Thousands are\r\n   annually cured, without hindrance from business or change of diet.\r\n   The directions are readily followed. Even a man’s most intimate\r\n   companion cannot suspect of his being treated.\r\n\r\n _Persons afflicted living in the interior, can, by stating fully in\r\n   a letter their symptoms, receive advice and remedies at home._\r\n\r\n          =Important to Persons Afflicted with Venereal=.\r\n\r\n   There are no maladies, either in a medical or moral point\r\n   of view, worse than those arising from the contamination of\r\n   VENEREAL POISON. None are more terrible in their effects,\r\n   or more disastrous in their results. MERCURY will not\r\n   cure VENEREAL, BUT DRIES ON THE SURFACE, TO ALLOW IT TO\r\n   POISON AND DESTROY THE BLOOD, TO RE-APPEAR IN HIDEOUS\r\n   MARKS UPON THE BODY, and in the throat, mouth and nose.\r\n\r\n   Having treated a great number of nautical men, the Doctor\r\n   fully understands their peculiar requirements, and the medicines\r\n   prescribed do not interfere with their occupation.\r\n\r\n        All letters should be addressed, Dr. BENJ.
