It is an imperative duty, because it must be performed at\r\nonce, for otherwise it will be too late. Every possible means of\r\npreservation,--sentimental, educational and legislative,--must be\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\nThe present warning issues with no uncertain sound, because this great\r\nbattle for preservation and conservation cannot be won by gentle tones,\r\nnor by appeals to the aesthetic instincts of those who have no sense of\r\nbeauty, or enjoyment of Nature. It is necessary to sound a loud alarm,\r\nto present the facts in very strong language, backed up by irrefutable\r\nstatistics and by photographs which tell no lies, to establish the law\r\nand enforce it if needs be with a bludgeon.\r\n\r\nThis book is such an alarm call. Its forceful pages remind me of the\r\nsounding of the great bells in the watch-towers of the cities of the\r\nMiddle Ages which called the citizens to arms to protect their homes,\r\ntheir liberties and their happiness. It is undeniable that the welfare\r\nand happiness of our own and of all future generations of Americans are\r\nat stake in this battle for the preservation of Nature against the\r\nselfishness, the ignorance, or the cruelty of her destroyers.\r\n\r\nWe no longer destroy great works of art. They are treasured, and\r\nregarded as of priceless value; but we have yet to attain the state of\r\ncivilization where the destruction of a glorious work of Nature, whether\r\nit be a cliff, a forest, or a species of mammal or bird, is regarded\r\nwith equal abhorrence. The whole earth is a poorer place to live in when\r\na colony of exquisite egrets or birds of paradise is destroyed in order\r\nthat the plumes may decorate the hat of some lady of fashion, and\r\nultimately find their way into the rubbish heap. The people of all the\r\nNew England States are poorer when the ignorant whites, foreigners, or\r\nnegroes of our southern states destroy the robins and other song birds\r\nof the North for a mess of pottage.\r\n\r\nTravels through Europe, as well as over a large part of the North\r\nAmerican continent, have convinced me that nowhere is Nature being\r\ndestroyed so rapidly as in the United States. Except within our\r\nconservation areas, an earthly paradise is being turned into an earthly\r\nhades; and it is not savages nor primitive men who are doing this, but\r\nmen and women who boast of their civilization. Air and water are\r\npolluted, rivers and streams serve as sewers and dumping grounds,\r\nforests are swept away and fishes are driven from the streams. Many\r\nbirds are becoming extinct, and certain mammals are on the verge of\r\nextermination. Vulgar advertisements hide the landscape, and in all\r\nthat disfigures the wonderful heritage of the beauty of Nature to-day,\r\nwe Americans are in the lead.\r\n\r\nFortunately the tide of destruction is ebbing, and the tide of\r\nconservation is coming in. Americans are practical. Like all other\r\nnorthern peoples, they love money and will sacrifice much for it, but\r\nthey are also full of idealism, as well as of moral and spiritual\r\nenergy. The influence of the splendid body of Americans and Canadians\r\nwho have turned their best forces of mind and language into literature\r\nand into political power for the conservation movement, is becoming\r\nstronger every day. Yet we are far from the point where the momentum of\r\nconservation is strong enough to arrest and roll back the tide of\r\ndestruction; and this is especially true with regard to our fast\r\nvanishing animal life.\r\n\r\nThe facts and figures set forth in this volume will astonish all those\r\nlovers of Nature and friends of the animal world who are living in a\r\nfalse or imaginary sense of security. The logic of these facts is\r\ninexorable. As regards our birds and mammals, the failures of supposed\r\nprotection in America--under a system of free shooting--are so glaring\r\nthat we are confident this exposure will lead to sweeping reforms. The\r\nauthor of this work is no amateur in the field of wild-life protection.\r\nHis ideas concerning methods of reform are drawn from long and\r\nsuccessful experience. The states which are still behind in this\r\nmovement may well give serious heed to his summons, and pass the new\r\nlaws that are so urgently demanded to save the vanishing remnant.\r\n\r\nThe New York Zoological Society, which is cooperating with many other\r\norganizations in this great movement, sends forth this work in the\r\nbelief that there is no one who is more ardently devoted to the great\r\ncause or rendering more effective service in it than William T.\r\nHornaday. We believe that this is a great book, destined to exert a\r\nworld-wide influence, to be translated into other languages, and to\r\narouse the defenders and lovers of our vanishing animal life before it\r\nis too late.\r\n\r\nHENRY FAIRFIELD OSBORN,\r\n10 December, 1912. _President of the New York Zoological Society_\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe writing of this book has taught me many things. Beyond question, we\r\nare exterminating our finest species of mammals, birds and fishes\r\n_according to law!_\r\n\r\nI am appalled by the mass of evidence proving that throughout the entire\r\nUnited States and Canada, in every state and province, the existing\r\nlegal system for the preservation of wild life is fatally defective.\r\nThere is not a single state in our country from which the killable game\r\nis not being rapidly and persistently shot to death, legally or\r\nillegally, very much more rapidly than it is breeding, with\r\nextermination for the most of it close in sight. This statement is not\r\nopen to argument; for millions of men know that it is literally true. We\r\nare living in a fool's paradise.\r\n\r\nThe rage for wild-life slaughter is far more prevalent to-day throughout\r\nthe world than it was in 1872, when the buffalo butchers paved the\r\nprairies of Texas and Colorado with festering carcasses. From one end of\r\nour continent to the other, there is a restless, resistless desire to\r\n\"kill, _kill!_\"\r\n\r\nI have been shocked by the accumulation of evidence showing that all\r\nover our country and Canada fully nine-tenths of our protective laws\r\nhave practically been dictated by the killers of the game, and that in\r\nall save a very few instances the hunters have been exceedingly careful\r\nto provide \"open seasons\" for slaughter, as long as any game remains to\r\nkill!\r\n\r\n_And yet, the game of North America does not belong wholly and\r\nexclusively to the men who kill! The other ninety-seven per cent of the\r\nPeople have vested rights in it, far exceeding those of the three per\r\ncent. Posterity has claims upon it that no honest man can ignore._\r\n\r\nI am now going to ask both the true sportsman and the people who do not\r\nkill wild things to awake, and do their plain duty in protecting and\r\npreserving the game and other wild life which belongs partly to us, but\r\nchiefly to those who come after us. Can they be aroused, before it is\r\ntoo late?\r\n\r\nThe time to discuss tiresome academic theories regarding \"bag limits\"\r\nand different \"open seasons\" as being sufficient to preserve the game,\r\nhas gone by! We have reached the point where the alternatives are _long\r\nclosed seasons or a gameless continent;_ and we must choose one or the\r\nother, speedily. A continent without wild life is like a forest with no\r\nleaves on the trees.\r\n\r\nThe great increase in the slaughter of song birds for food, by the\r\nnegroes and poor whites of the South, has become an unbearable scourge\r\nto our migratory birds,--the very birds on which farmers north and south\r\ndepend for protection from the insect hordes,--the very birds that are\r\nmost near and dear to the people of the North. _Song-bird slaughter is\r\ngrowing and spreading_, with the decrease of the game birds! It is a\r\nmatter that requires instant attention and stern repression. At the\r\npresent moment it seems that the only remedy lies in federal protection\r\nfor all migratory birds,--because so many states will not do their duty.\r\n\r\nWe are weary of witnessing the greed, selfishness and cruelty of\r\n\"civilized\" man toward the wild creatures of the earth. We are sick of\r\ntales of slaughter and pictures of carnage. It is time for a sweeping\r\nReformation; and that is precisely what we now demand.\r\n\r\nI have been a sportsman myself; but times have changed, and we must\r\nchange also. When game was plentiful, I believed that it was right for\r\nmen and boys to kill a limited amount of it for sport and for the table.\r\nBut the old basis has been swept away by an Army of Destruction that now\r\nis almost beyond all control. We must awake, and arouse to the new\r\nsituation, face it like men, and adjust our minds to the new conditions.\r\nThe three million gunners of to-day must no longer expect or demand the\r\nsame generous hunting privileges that were right for hunters fifty years\r\nago, when game was fifty times as plentiful as it is now and there was\r\nonly one killer for every fifty now in the field.\r\n\r\nThe fatalistic idea that bag-limit laws can save the game is to-day _the\r\ncurse of all our game birds, mammals and fishes!_ It is a fraud, a\r\ndelusion and a snare. That miserable fetish has been worshipped much too\r\nlong. Our game is being exterminated, everywhere, by blind insistence\r\nupon \"open seasons,\" and solemn reliance upon \"legal bag-limits.\" If a\r\nmajority of the people of America feel that so long as there is any game\r\nalive there must be an annual two months or four months open season for\r\nits slaughter, then assuredly we soon will have a gameless continent.\r\n\r\nThe only thing that will save the game is by stopping the killing of it!\r\nIn establishing and promulgating this principle, the cause of wild-life\r\nprotection greatly needs three things: money, labor, and publicity. With\r\nthe first, we can secure the second and third. But can we get it,--and\r\n_get it in time to save?_\r\n\r\nThis volume is in every sense a contribution to a Cause; and as such it\r\never will remain. I wish the public to receive it on that basis. So much\r\nimportant material has drifted straight to it from other hands that this\r\nunexpected aid seems to the author like a good omen.\r\n\r\nThe manuscript has received the benefit of a close and critical reading\r\nand correcting by my comrade on the firing-line and esteemed friend, Mr.\r\nMadison Grant, through which the text was greatly improved. But for the\r\nsplendid encouragement and assistance that I have received from him and\r\nfrom Professor Henry Fairneld Osborn the work involved would have borne\r\ndown rather heavily.\r\n\r\nThe four chapters embracing the \"New Laws Needed; A Roll-Call of the\r\nStates,\" were critically inspected, corrected and brought down to date\r\nby Dr. T.S. Palmer, our highest authority on the game laws of the Nation\r\nand the States. For this valuable service the author is deeply grateful.\r\nOf course the author is alone responsible for all the opinions and\r\nconclusions herein recorded, and for all errors that appear outside of\r\nquotations.\r\n\r\nI trust that the Reader will kindly excuse and forget all the\r\ntypographic and clerical errors that may have escaped me in the rush\r\nthat had to be made against Time.\r\n\r\nW.T.H.\r\n\r\nUNIVERSITY HEIGHTS, NEW YORK,\r\nDecember 1, 1912.\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I.--EXTERMINATION\r\n\r\nChapter\r\nI.

EXTERMINATION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTHE FORMER ABUNDANCE OF WILD LIFE\r\n\r\n\r\n_\"By my labors my vineyard flourished. But Ahab came. Alas! for Naboth.\"_\r\n\r\nIn order that the American people may correctly understand and judge the\r\nquestion of the extinction or preservation of our wild life, it is\r\nnecessary to recall the near past. It is not necessary, however, to go\r\nfar into the details of history; for a few quick glances at a few high\r\npoints will be quite sufficient for the purpose in view.\r\n\r\nAny man who reads the books which best tell the story of the development\r\nof the American colonies of 1712 into the American nation of 1912, and\r\ntakes due note of the wild-life features of the tale, will say without\r\nhesitation that when the American people received this land from the\r\nbountiful hand of Nature, it was endowed with a magnificent and\r\nall-pervading supply of valuable wild creatures. The pioneers and the\r\nearly settlers were too busy even to take due note of that fact, or to\r\ncomment upon it, save in very fragmentary ways.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the wild-life abundance of early American days survived\r\ndown to so late a period that it touched the lives of millions of people\r\nnow living. Any man 55 years of age who when a boy had a taste for\r\n\"hunting,\"--for at that time there were no \"sportsmen\" in America,--will\r\nremember the flocks and herds of wild creatures that he saw and which\r\nmade upon his mind many indelible impressions.\r\n\r\n\"Abundance\" is the word with which to describe the original animal life\r\nthat stocked our country, and all North America, only a short\r\nhalf-century ago. Throughout every state, on every shore-line, in all\r\nthe millions of fresh water lakes, ponds and rivers, on every mountain\r\nrange, in every forest, _and even on every desert_, the wild flocks and\r\nherds held sway. It was impossible to go beyond the settled haunts of\r\ncivilized man and escape them.\r\n\r\nIt was a full century after the complete settlement of New England and\r\nthe Virginia colonies that the wonderful big-game fauna of the great\r\nplains and Rocky Mountains was really discovered; but the bison\r\nmillions, the antelope millions, the mule deer, the mountain sheep and\r\nmountain goat were there, all the time. In the early days, the millions\r\nof pinnated grouse and quail of the central states attracted no serious\r\nattention from the American people-at-large; but they lived and\r\nflourished just the same, far down in the seventies, when the greedy\r\nmarket gunners systematically slaughtered them, and barreled them up for\r\n\"the market,\" while the foolish farmers calmly permitted them to do it.\r\n\r\nWe obtain the best of our history of the former abundance of North\r\nAmerican wild life first from the pages of Audubon and Wilson; next,\r\nfrom the records left by such pioneers as Lewis and Clark, and last from\r\nthe testimony of living men. To all this we can, many of us, add\r\nobservations of our own.\r\n\r\nTo me the most striking fact that stands forth in the story of American\r\nwild life one hundred years ago is the wide extent and thoroughness of\r\nits distribution. Wide as our country is, and marvelous as it is in the\r\ndiversity of its climates, its soils, its topography, its flora, its\r\nriches and its poverty, Nature gave to each square mile and to each acre\r\na generous quota of wild creatures, according to its ability to maintain\r\nliving things. No pioneer ever pushed so far, or into regions so\r\ndifficult or so remote, that he did not find awaiting him a host of\r\nbirds and beasts. Sometimes the pioneer was not a good hunter; usually\r\nhe was a stupid fisherman; but the \"game\" was there, nevertheless. The\r\ntime was when every farm had its quota.\r\n\r\nThe part that the wild life of America played in the settlement and\r\ndevelopment of this continent was so far-reaching in extent, and so\r\nenormous in potential value, that it fairly staggers the imagination.\r\nFrom the landing of the Pilgrims down to the present hour the wild game\r\nhas been the mainstay and the resource against starvation of the\r\npathfinder, the settler, the prospector, and at times even the\r\nrailroad-builder. In view of what the bison millions did for the\r\nDakotas, Montana, Wyoming, Kansas and Texas, it is only right and square\r\nthat those states should now do something for the perpetual preservation\r\nof the bison species and all other big game that needs help.\r\n\r\nFor years and years, the antelope millions of the Montana and Wyoming\r\ngrass-lands fed the scout and Indian-fighter, freighter, cowboy and\r\nsurveyor, ranchman _and sheep-herder_; but thus far I have yet to hear\r\nof one Western state that has ever spent one penny directly for the\r\npreservation of the antelope! And to-day we are in a hand-to-hand fight\r\nin Congress, and in Montana, with the Wool-Growers Association, which\r\nmaintains in Washington a keen lobbyist to keep aloft the tariff on\r\nwool, and prevent Congress from taking 15 square miles of grass lands on\r\nSnow Creek, Montana, for a National Antelope Preserve. All that the\r\nwool-growers want is the entire earth, all to themselves. Mr. McClure,\r\nthe Secretary of the Association says:\r\n\r\n\"The proper place in which to preserve the big game of the West is in\r\ncity parks, where it can be protected.\"\r\n\r\nTo the colonist of the East and pioneer of the West, the white-tailed\r\ndeer was an ever present help in time of trouble. Without this\r\nomnipresent animal, and the supply of good meat that each white flag\r\nrepresented, the commissariat difficulties of the settlers who won the\r\ncountry as far westward as Indiana would have been many times greater\r\nthan they were. The backwoods Pilgrim's progress was like this:\r\n\r\nTrail, deer; cabin, deer; clearing; bear, corn, deer; hogs, deer;\r\ncattle, wheat, independence.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, how many men are there to-day, out of our ninety millions of\r\nAmericans and pseudo-Americans, who remember with any feeling of\r\ngratitude the part played in American history by the white-tailed deer?\r\nVery few! How many Americans are there in our land who now preserve that\r\ndeer for sentimental reasons, and because his forbears were\r\nnation-builders? As a matter of fact, are there any?\r\n\r\nOn every eastern pioneer's monument, the white-tailed deer should\r\nfigure; and on those of the Great West, the bison and the antelope\r\nshould be cast in enduring bronze, \"_lest we forget!_\"\r\n\r\nThe game birds of America played a different part from that of the deer,\r\nantelope and bison. In the early days, shotguns were few, and shot was\r\nscarce and dear. The wild turkey and goose were the smallest birds on\r\nwhich a rifleman could afford to expend a bullet and a whole charge of\r\npowder. It was for this reason that the deer, bear, bison, and elk\r\ndisappeared from the eastern United States while the game birds yet\r\nremained abundant. With the disappearance of the big game came the fat\r\nsteer, hog and hominy, the wheat-field, fruit orchard and poultry\r\ngalore.\r\n\r\nThe game birds of America, as a class and a mass, have not been swept\r\naway to ward off starvation or to rescue the perishing. Even back in the\r\nsixties and seventies, very, very few men of the North thought of\r\nkilling prairie chickens, ducks and quail, snipe and woodcock, in order\r\nto keep the hunger wolf from the door. The process was too slow and\r\nuncertain; and besides, the really-poor man rarely had the gun and\r\nammunition. Instead of attempting to live on birds, he hustled for the\r\nstaple food products that the soil of his own farm could produce.\r\n\r\nFirst, last and nearly all the time, the game birds of the United States\r\nas a whole, have been sacrificed on the altar of Rank Luxury, to tempt\r\nappetites that were tired of fried chicken and other farm delicacies.\r\nTo-day, even the average poor man hunts birds for the joy of the outing,\r\nand the pampered epicures of the hotels and restaurants buy game birds,\r\nand eat small portions of them, solely to tempt jaded appetites. If\r\nthere is such a thing as \"class\" legislation, it is that which permits a\r\nfew sordid market-shooters to slaughter the birds of the whole people in\r\norder to sell them to a few epicures.\r\n\r\nThe game of a state belongs to the whole people of the state. The\r\nSupreme Court of the United States has so decided. (Geer vs.\r\nConnecticut). If it is abundant, it is a valuable asset. The great value\r\nof the game birds of America lies not in their meat pounds as they lie\r\nupon the table, but in the temptation they annually put before millions\r\nof field-weary farmers and desk-weary clerks and merchants to get into\r\ntheir beloved hunting togs, stalk out into the lap of Nature, and say\r\n\"Begone, dull Care!\"\r\n\r\nAnd the man who has had a fine day in the painted woods, on the bright\r\nwaters of a duck-haunted bay, or in the golden stubble of September, can\r\nfill his day and his soul with six good birds just as well as with\r\nsixty. The idea that in order to enjoy a fine day in the open a man must\r\nkill a wheel-barrow load of birds, is a mistaken idea; and if\r\nobstinately adhered to, it becomes vicious! The Outing in the Open is\r\nthe thing,--not the blood-stained feathers, nasty viscera and Death in\r\nthe game-bag. One quail on a fence is worth more to the world than ten\r\nin a bag.\r\n\r\nThe farmers of America have, by their own supineness and lack of\r\nforesight, permitted the slaughter of a stock of game birds which, had\r\nit been properly and wisely conserved, would have furnished a good\r\nannual shoot to every farming man and boy of sporting instincts through\r\nthe past, right down to the present, and far beyond. They have allowed\r\nmillions of dollars worth of _their_ birds to be coolly snatched away\r\nfrom them by the greedy market-shooters.\r\n\r\nThere is one state in America, and so far as I know _only one_, in which\r\nthere is at this moment an old-time abundance of game-bird life. That is\r\nthe state of Louisiana. The reason is not so very far to seek. For the\r\nbirds that do not migrate,--quail, wild turkeys and doves,--the cover is\r\nyet abundant. For the migratory game birds of the Mississippi Valley,\r\nLouisiana is a grand central depot, with terminal facilities that are\r\nunsurpassed. Her reedy shores, her vast marshes, her long coast line and\r\nabundance of food furnish what should be not only a haven but a heaven\r\nfor ducks and geese. After running the gauntlet of guns all the way from\r\nManitoba and Ontario to the Sunk Lands of Arkansas, the shores of the\r\nGulf must seem like heaven itself.\r\n\r\nThe great forests of Louisiana shelter deer, turkeys, and fur-bearing\r\nanimals galore; and rabbits and squirrels abound.\r\n\r\nNaturally, this abundance of game has given rise to an extensive\r\nindustry in shooting for the market. The \"big interests\" outside the\r\nstate send their agents into the best game districts, often bringing in\r\ntheir own force of shooters. They comb out the game in enormous\r\nquantities, without leaving to the people of Louisiana any decent and\r\nfair quid-pro-quo for having despoiled them of their game and shipped a\r\nvast annual product outside, to create wealth elsewhere.\r\n\r\nAt present, however, we are but incidentally interested in the\r\nshort-sightedness of the people of the Pelican State. As a state of\r\noldtime abundance in killable game, the killing records that were kept\r\nin the year 1909-10 possess for us very great interest. They throw a\r\nstartling searchlight on the subject of this chapter,--the former\r\nabundance of wild life.\r\n\r\nFrom the records that with great pains and labor were gathered by the\r\nState Game Commission, and which were furnished me for use here by\r\nPresident Frank M. Miller, we set forth this remarkable exhibit of\r\nold-fashioned abundance in game, A.D. 1909.\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nOFFICIAL RECORD OF GAME KILLED IN LOUISIANA DURING THE SEASON (12\r\nMONTHS) OF 1909-10\r\n\r\nBIRDS\r\n\r\nWild Ducks, sea and river             3,176,000\r\nCoots                                   280,740\r\nGeese and Brant                         202,210\r\nSnipe, Sandpiper and Plover             606,635\r\nQuail (Bob-White)                     1,140,750\r\nDoves                                   310,660\r\nWild Turkeys                              2,219\r\n                                     ----------\r\n  Total number of game birds killed   5,719,214\r\n\r\nMAMMALS\r\n\r\nDeer                                      5,470\r\nSquirrels and Rabbits                   690,270\r\n                                     ----------\r\n  Total of game mammals                 695,740\r\nFur-bearing mammals                   1,971,922\r\n                                     ----------\r\n  Total of mammals                    2,667,662\r\n                                     ----------\r\n  Grand total of birds and mammals    8,386,876\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nOf the thousands of slaughtered robins, it would seem that no records\r\nexist. It is to be understood that the annual slaughter of wild life in\r\nLouisiana never before reached such a pitch as now. Without drastic\r\nmeasures, what will be the inevitable result? Does any man suppose that\r\neven the wild millions of Louisiana can long withstand such slaughter as\r\nthat shown by the official figures given above? It is wildly impossible.\r\n\r\nBut the darkest hour is just before the dawn. At the session of the\r\nLouisiana legislature that was held in the spring of 1912, great\r\nimprovements were made in the game laws of that state. The most\r\nimportant feature was the suppression of wholesale market hunting, by\r\npersons who are not residents of the state. A very limited amount of\r\ngame may be sold and served as food in public places, but the\r\nrestrictions placed upon this traffic are so effective that they will\r\nvastly reduce the annual slaughter. In other respects, also, the cause\r\nof wild life protection gained much; for which great credit is due to\r\nMr. Edward A. McIlhenny.\r\n\r\nIt is the way of Americans to feel that because game is abundant in a\r\ngiven place at a given time, it always will be abundant, and may\r\ntherefore be slaughtered without limit. That was the case last winter in\r\nCalifornia during the awful slaughter of band-tailed pigeons, as will be\r\nnoted elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIt is time for all men to be told in the plainest terms that there never\r\nhas existed, anywhere in historic times, a volume of wild life so great\r\nthat civilized man could not quickly exterminate it by his methods of\r\ndestruction. Lift the veil and look at the stories of the bison, the\r\npassenger pigeon, the wild ducks and shore birds of the Atlantic coast,\r\nand the fur-seal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHALL WE LEAVE ANY ONE OF THEM OPEN?]\r\n\r\nAs reasoning beings, it is our duty to heed the lessons of history, and\r\nnot rush blindly on until we perpetrate a continent destitute of wild\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nEXTINCT SPECIES OF NORTH AMERICAN BIRDS\r\n\r\n\r\nFor educated, civilized Man to exterminate a valuable wild species of\r\nliving things is a crime. It is a crime against his own children, and\r\nposterity.\r\n\r\nNo man has a right, either moral or legal, to destroy or squander an\r\ninheritance of his children that he holds for them in trust. And man,\r\nthe wasteful and greedy spendthrift that he is, has not created even the\r\nhumblest of the species of birds, mammals and fishes that adorn and\r\nenrich this earth. \"The earth is THE LORD'S, and the fulness thereof!\"\r\nWith all his wisdom, man has not evolved and placed here so much as a\r\nground-squirrel, a sparrow or a clam. It is true that he has juggled\r\nwith the wild horse and sheep, the goats and the swine, and produced\r\nsome hardy breeds that can withstand his abuse without going down before\r\nit; but as for species, he has not yet created and placed here even so\r\nmuch as a protozoan.\r\n\r\nThe wild things of this earth are _not_ ours, to do with as we please.\r\nThey have been given to us _in trust_, and we must account for them to\r\nthe generations which will come after us and audit our accounts.\r\n\r\nBut man, the shameless destroyer of Nature's gifts, blithely and\r\npersistently exterminates one species after another. Fully ten per cent\r\nof the human race consists of people who will lie, steal, throw rubbish\r\nin parks, and destroy forests and wild life whenever and wherever they\r\ncan do so without being stopped by a policemen and a club. These are\r\nhard words, but they are absolutely true. From ten per cent (or more) of\r\nthe human race, the high moral instinct which is honest without\r\ncompulsion _is absent_. The things that seemingly decent citizens,--men\r\nposing as gentlemen,--will do to wild game when they secure great\r\nchances to slaughter, are appalling. I could fill a book of this size\r\nwith cases in point.\r\n\r\nTo-day the women of England, Europe and elsewhere are directly promoting\r\nthe extermination of scores of beautiful species of wild birds by the\r\ndevilish persistence with which they buy and wear feather ornaments made\r\nof their plumage. They are just as mean and cruel as the truck-driver\r\nwho drives a horse with a sore shoulder and beats him on the street. But\r\nthey do it! And appeals to them to do otherwise they laugh to scorn,\r\nsaying, \"I will wear what is fashionable, when I please and where I\r\nplease!\" As a famous bird protector of England has just written me, \"The\r\nwomen of the smart set are beyond the reach of appeal or protest.\"\r\n\r\nTo-day, the thing that stares me in the face every waking hour, like a\r\ngrisly spectre with bloody fang and claw, is _the extermination of\r\nspecies_. To me, that is a horrible thing. It is wholesale murder, no\r\nless. It is capital crime, and a black disgrace to the races of\r\ncivilized mankind. I say \"civilized mankind,\" because savages don't do\r\nit!\r\n\r\nThere are three kinds of extermination:\r\n\r\n_The practical extermination of a species_ means the destruction of its\r\nmembers to an extent so thorough and widespread that the species\r\ndisappears from view, and living specimens of it can not be found by\r\nseeking for them. In North America this is to-day the status of the\r\nwhooping crane, upland plover, and several other species. If any\r\nindividuals are living, they will be met with only by accident.\r\n\r\n_The absolute extermination_ of a species means that not one individual\r\nof it remains alive. Judgment to this effect is based upon the lapse of\r\ntime since the last living specimen was observed or killed. When five\r\nyears have passed without a living \"record\" of a wild specimen, it is\r\ntime to place a species in the class of the totally extinct.\r\n\r\n_Extermination in a wild state_ means that the only living\r\nrepresentatives are in captivity or otherwise under protection. This is\r\nthe case of the heath hen and David's deer, of China. The American bison\r\nis saved from being wholly extinct as a wild animal by the remnant of\r\nabout 300 head in northern Athabasca, and 49 head in the Yellow-stone\r\nPark.\r\n\r\nIt is a serious thing to exterminate a species of any of the vertebrate\r\nanimals. There are probably millions of people who do not realize that\r\ncivilized (!) man is the most persistently and wickedly wasteful of all\r\nthe predatory animals. The lions, the tigers, the bears, the eagles and\r\nhawks, serpents, and the fish-eating fishes, all live by destroying\r\nlife; but they kill only what they think they can consume. If something\r\nis by chance left over, it goes to satisfy the hunger of the humbler\r\ncreatures of prey. _In a state of nature, where wild creatures prey upon\r\nwild creatures, such a thing as wanton, wholesale and utterly wasteful\r\nslaughter is almost unknown!_\r\n\r\nWhen the wild mink, weasel and skunk suddenly finds himself in the midst\r\nof scores of man's confined and helpless domestic fowls, or his caged\r\ngulls in a zoological park, an unusual criminal passion to murder for\r\nthe joy of killing sometimes seizes the wild animal, and great slaughter\r\nis the result.\r\n\r\nFrom the earliest historic times, it has been the way of savage man,\r\nred, black, brown and yellow, to kill as the wild animals do,--only what\r\nhe can use, or _thinks_ he can use. The Cree Indian impounded small\r\nherds of bison, and sometimes killed from 100 to 200 at one time; but it\r\nwas to make sure of having enough meat and hides, and because he\r\nexpected to use the product. I think that even the worst enemies of the\r\nplains Indians hardly will accuse them of killing large numbers of\r\nbison, elk or deer merely for the pleasure of seeing them fall, or\r\ntaking only their teeth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIX RECENTLY EXTERMINATED NORTH AMERICAN BIRDS\r\nGreat Auk             Labrador Duck\r\nEskimo Curlew         Pallas Cormorant\r\nPassenger Pigeon      Carolina Parrakeet]\r\n\r\nIt has remained for the wolf, the sheep-killing dog and civilized man to\r\nmake records of wanton slaughter which puts them in a class together,\r\nand quite apart from other predatory animals. When a man can kill bison\r\nfor their tongues alone, bull elk for their \"tusks\" alone, and shoot a\r\nwhole colony of hippopotami,--actually damming a river with their\r\nbloated and putrid carcasses, all untouched by the knife,--the men who\r\ndo such things must be classed with the cruel wolf and the criminal dog.\r\n\r\nIt is now desirable that we should pause in our career of destruction\r\nlong enough to look back upon what we have recently accomplished in the\r\ntotal extinction of species, and also note what we have blocked out for\r\nthe immediate future. Here let us erect a monument to the dead species\r\nof our own times.\r\n\r\nIt is to be doubted whether, up to this hour, any man has made a list of\r\nthe species of North American birds that have become extinct during the\r\npast sixty years. The specialists have no time to spare from their\r\ncompound differential microscopes, and the bird-killers are too busy\r\nwith shooting, netting and clubbing to waste any time on such trifles as\r\nexterminated species. What does a market-shooter care about birds that\r\ncan not be killed a second time? As for the farmers, they are so busy\r\nraising hogs and prices that their best friends, the birds, get scant\r\nattention from them,--until a hen-hawk takes a chicken!\r\n\r\nDown South, the negroes and poor whites may slaughter robins for food by\r\nthe ten thousand; but does the northern farmer bother his head about a\r\ntrifle of that kind? No, indeed. Will he contribute any real money to\r\nhelp put a stop to it? Ask him yourself.\r\n\r\nLet us pause long enough to reckon up some of our expenditures in\r\nspecies, and in millions of individuals. Let us set down here, in cold\r\nblood, a list of the species of our own North American birds that have\r\nbeen totally exterminated in our own times. After that we will have\r\nsomething to say about other species that soon will be exterminated; and\r\nthe second task is much greater than the first.\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nROLL CALL OF THE DEAD SPECIES OF AMERICAN BIRDS\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT AUK,--_Plautus-impennis_, (Linn.), was a sea-going diving bird\r\nabout the size of a domestic goose, related to the guillemots, murres\r\nand puffins. For a bird endowed only with flipper-like wings, and\r\ntherefore absolutely unable to fly, this species had an astonishing\r\ngeographic range. It embraced the shores of northern Europe to North\r\nCape, southern Greenland, southern Labrador, and the Atlantic coast of\r\nNorth America as far south as Massachusetts. Some say, \"as far south as\r\nMassachusetts, the Carolinas and Florida,\" but that is a large order,\r\nand I leave the A.O.U. to prove that if it can. In the life history of\r\nthis bird, a great tragedy was enacted in 1800 by sailors, on Funk\r\nIsland, north of Newfoundland, where men were landed by a ship, and\r\nspent several months slaughtering great auks and trying out their fat\r\nfor oil. In this process, the bodies of thousands of auks were burned as\r\nfuel, in working up the remains of tens of thousands of others.\r\n\r\nOn Funk Island, a favorite breeding-place, the great auk was\r\nexterminated in 1840, and in Iceland in 1844. Many natives ate this bird\r\nwith relish, and being easily captured, either on land or sea, the\r\ncommercialism of its day soon obliterated the species. The last living\r\nspecimen was seen in 1852, and the last dead one was picked up in\r\nTrinity Bay, Ireland, in 1853. There are about 80 mounted and unmounted\r\nskins in existence, four skeletons, and quite a number of eggs. An egg\r\nis worth about $1200 and a good mounted skin at least double that sum.\r\n\r\nTHE LABRADOR DUCK,--_Camptorhynchus labradoricus_, (Gmel.).--This\r\nhandsome sea-duck, of a species related to the eider ducks of arctic\r\nwaters, became totally extinct about 1875, before the scientific world\r\neven knew that its existence was threatened. With this species, the\r\nexact and final cause of its extinction is to this day unknown. It is\r\nnot at all probable, however, that its unfortunate blotting out from our\r\nbird fauna was due to natural causes, and when the truth becomes known,\r\nit is very probable that the hand of man will be revealed.\r\n\r\nThe Labrador duck bred in Labrador, and once frequented our Atlantic\r\ncoast as far south as Chesapeake Bay; but it is said that it never was\r\nvery numerous, at least during the twenty-five years preceding its\r\ndisappearance. About thirty-five skins and mounted museum specimens are\r\nall that remain to prove its former existence, and I think there is not\r\neven one skeleton.\r\n\r\nTHE PALLAS CORMORANT,--_Carbo perspicillatus_, (Pallas).--In 1741, when\r\nthe Russian explorer, Commander Bering, discovered the Bering or\r\nCommander Islands, in the far-north Pacific, and landed upon them, he\r\nalso discovered this striking bird species. Its plumage both above and\r\nbelow was a dark metallic green, with blue iridescence on the neck and\r\npurple on the shoulders. A pale ring of naked skin around each eye\r\nsuggested the Latin specific name of this bird. The Pallas cormorant\r\nbecame totally extinct, through causes not positively known, about 1852.\r\n\r\nTHE PASSENGER PIGEON,--_Ectopistes migratoria_, (Linn.).--We place this\r\nbird in the totally-extinct class, not only because it is extinct in a\r\nwild state, but only one solitary individual, a twenty-year-old female\r\nin the Cincinnati Zoological Gardens, now remains alive. One living\r\nspecimen and a few skins, skeletons and stuffed specimens are all that\r\nremain to show for the uncountable millions of pigeons that swarmed over\r\nthe United States, only yesterday as it were!\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt about where those millions have gone. They went down\r\nand out by systematic, wholesale slaughter for the market and the pot,\r\nbefore the shotguns, _clubs_ and _nets_ of the earliest American\r\npot-hunters. Wherever they nested they were slaughtered.\r\n\r\nIt is a long and shameful story, but the grisly skeleton of its Michigan\r\nchapter can be set forth in a few words. In 1869, from the town of\r\nHartford, Mich., _three car loads_ of dead pigeons were shipped to\r\nmarket each day for _forty days_, making a total of 11,880,000 birds. It\r\nis recorded that another Michigan town marketed 15,840,000 in two years.\r\n(See Mr. W.B. Mershon's book, \"The Passenger Pigeon.\")\r\n\r\nAlexander Wilson, the pioneer American ornithologist, was the man who\r\nseriously endeavored to estimate by computations the total number of\r\npassenger pigeons in one flock that was seen by him. Here is what he has\r\nsaid in his \"American Ornithology\":\r\n\r\n\"To form a rough estimate of the daily consumption of one of these\r\nimmense flocks, let us first attempt to calculate the numbers of that\r\nabove mentioned, as seen in passing between Frankfort and the Indiana\r\nterritory. If we suppose this column to have been one mile in breadth\r\n(and I believe it to have been much more) and that it moved at the rate\r\nof one mile in a minute, four hours, the time it continued passing,\r\nwould make its whole length two hundred and forty miles. Again,\r\nsupposing that each square yard of this moving body comprehended three\r\npigeons; the square yards in the whole space multiplied by three would\r\ngive 2,230,272,000 pigeons! An almost inconceivable multitude, and yet\r\nprobably far below the actual amount.\"\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\n\"Happening to go ashore one charming afternoon, to purchase some milk at\r\na house that stood near the river, and while talking with the people\r\nwithin doors, I was suddenly struck with astonishment at a loud rushing\r\nroar, succeeded by instant darkness, which, on the first moment, I took\r\nfor a tornado about to overwhelm the house and every thing around in\r\ndestruction. The people observing my surprise, coolly said, 'It is only\r\nthe pigeons!' On running out I beheld a flock, thirty or forty yards in\r\nwidth, sweeping along very low, between the house and the mountain or\r\nheight that formed the second bank of the river. These continued passing\r\nfor more than a quarter of an hour, and at length varied their bearing\r\nso as to pass over the mountains, behind which they disappeared before\r\nthe rear came up.\r\n\r\n\"In the Atlantic States, though they never appear in such unparalleled\r\nmultitudes, they are sometimes very numerous; and great havoc is then\r\nmade amongst them with the gun, the clap-net, and various other\r\nimplements of destruction. As soon as it is ascertained in a town that\r\nthe pigeons are flying numerously in the neighborhood, the gunners rise\r\n_en masse_; the clap-nets are spread out on suitable situations,\r\ncommonly on an open height in an old buckwheat field, four or five live\r\npigeons, _with their eyelids sewed up_,[A] are fastened on a movable\r\nstick, a small hut of branches is fitted up for the fowler at the\r\ndistance of forty or fifty yards. By the pulling of a string, the stick\r\non which the pigeons rest is alternately elevated and depressed, which\r\nproduces a fluttering of their wings, similar to that of birds\r\nalighting. This being perceived by the passing flocks, they descend with\r\ngreat rapidity, and finding corn, buckwheat, etc, strewed about, begin\r\nto feed, and are instantly, by the pulling of a cord, covered by the\r\nnet. In this manner ten, twenty, and even thirty dozen have been caught\r\nat one sweep. Meantime the air is darkened with large bodies of them\r\nmoving in various directions; the woods also swarm with them in search\r\nof acorns, and the thundering of musquetry is perpetual on all sides\r\nfrom morning to night. Wagon loads of them are poured into market, where\r\nthey sell from fifty to twenty-five and even twelve cents per dozen; and\r\npigeons become the order of the day at dinner, breakfast and supper,\r\nuntil the very name becomes sickening.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: To-day, we think that the fowlers of the roccolos of\r\nnorthern Italy are very cruel in their methods of catching song-birds\r\nwholesale for the market (chapter xi); but our own countrymen of\r\nWilson's day were just as cruel in the method described above.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nThe range of the passenger pigeon covered nearly the whole United\r\nStates from the Atlantic coast westward to the Rocky Mountains. A few\r\nbold pigeons crossed the Rocky Mountains into Oregon, northern\r\nCalifornia and Washington, but only as \"stragglers,\" few and far\r\nbetween. The wide range of this bird was worthy of a species that\r\nexisted in millions, and it was persecuted literally all along the line.\r\nThe greatest slaughter was in Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania. In 1848\r\nMassachusetts gravely passed a law protecting the _netters_ of wild\r\npigeons from foreign interference! There was a fine of $10 for damaging\r\nnets, or frightening pigeons away from them. This was on the theory that\r\nthe pigeons were so abundant they could not by any possibility ever\r\nbecome scarce, and that pigeon-slaughter was a legitimate industry.\r\n\r\nIn 1867, the State of New York found that the wild pigeon needed\r\nprotection, and enacted a law to that effect. The year 1868 was the last\r\nyear in which great numbers of passenger pigeons nested in that State.\r\nEaton, in \"The Birds of New York,\" said that \"millions of birds occupied\r\nthe timber along Bell's Run, near Ceres, Alleghany County, on the\r\nPennsylvania line.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1870, Massachusetts gave pigeons protection except during an \"open\r\nseason,\" and in 1878 Pennsylvania elected to protect pigeons on their\r\nnesting grounds.\r\n\r\nThe passenger pigeon millions were destroyed so quickly, and so\r\nthoroughly _en masse_, that the American people utterly failed to\r\ncomprehend it, and for thirty years obstinately refused to believe that\r\nthe species had been suddenly wiped off the map of North America. There\r\nwas years of talk about the great flocks having \"taken refuge in South\r\nAmerica,\" or in Mexico, and being still in existence. There were\r\nsurmises about their having all \"gone out to sea,\" and perished on the\r\nbriny deep.\r\n\r\nA thousand times, at least, wild pigeons have been \"reported\" as having\r\nbeen \"seen.\" These rumors have covered nearly every northern state, the\r\nwhole of the southwest, and California. For years and years we have been\r\npatiently writing letters to explain over and over that the band-tailed\r\npigeon of the Pacific coast, and the red-billed pigeon of Arizona and\r\nthe southwest are neither of them the passenger pigeon, and never can\r\nbe.\r\n\r\nThere was a long period wherein we believed many of the pigeon reports\r\nthat came from the states where the birds once were most numerous; but\r\nthat period has absolutely passed. During the past five years large cash\r\nrewards, aggregating about $5000, have been offered for the discovery\r\nof one nesting pair of genuine passenger pigeons. Many persons have\r\nclaimed this reward (of Professor C.F. Hodge, of Clark University,\r\nWorcester, Mass.), and many claims have been investigated. The results\r\nhave disclosed many _mourning doves_, but not one pigeon. Now we\r\nunderstand that the quest is closed, and hope has been abandoned.\r\n\r\nThe passenger pigeon is a dead species. The last wild specimen (so we\r\nbelieve) that ever will reach the hands of man, was taken near Detroit,\r\nMichigan, on Sept. 14, 1908, and mounted by C. Campion. That is the one\r\ndefinite, positive record of the past ten years.\r\n\r\nThe fate of this species should be a lasting lesson to the world at\r\nlarge. Any wild bird or mammal species can be exterminated by commercial\r\ninterests in twenty years time, or less.\r\n\r\nTHE ESKIMO CURLEW,_--Numenius borealis_, (Forst.). This valuable game\r\nbird once ranged all along the Atlantic coast of North America, and\r\nwherever found it was prized for the table. It preferred the fields and\r\nmeadows to the shore lines, and was the companion of the plovers of the\r\nuplands, especially the golden plover. \"About 1872,\" says Mr. Forbush,\r\n\"there was a great flight of these birds on Cape Cod and Nantucket. They\r\nwere everywhere; and enormous numbers were killed. They could be bought\r\nof boys at six cents apiece. Two men killed $300 worth of these birds at\r\nthat time.\"\r\n\r\nApparently, that was the beginning of the end of the \"dough bird,\" which\r\nwas another name for this curlew. In 1908 Mr. G.H. Mackay stated that\r\nthis bird and the golden plover had decreased 90 per cent in fifty\r\nyears, and in the last ten years of that period 90 per cent of the\r\nremainder had gone. \"Now (1908),\" says Mr. Forbush, \"ornithologists\r\nbelieve that the Eskimo curlew is practically extinct, as only a few\r\nspecimens have been recorded since the beginning of the twentieth\r\ncentury.\" The very last record is of two specimens collected at Waco,\r\nYork County, Nebraska, in March, 1911, and recorded by Mr. August Eiche.\r\nOf course, it is possible that other individuals may still survive; but\r\nso far as our knowledge extends, the species is absolutely dead.\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nIn the West Indies and the Guadeloupe Islands, five species of macaws\r\nand parrakeets have passed out without any serious note of their\r\ndisappearance on the part of the people of the United States. It is at\r\nleast time to write brief obituary notices of them.\r\n\r\nWe are indebted to the Hon. Walter Rothschild, of Tring, England, for\r\nessential facts regarding these species as set forth in his sumptuous\r\nwork \"Extinct Birds\".\r\n\r\nTHE CUBAN TRICOLORED MACAW,--_Ara tricolor_, (Gm.). In 1875, when the\r\nauthor visited Cuba and the Isle of Pines, he was informed by Professor\r\nPoey that he was \"about ten years too late\" to find this fine species\r\nalive. It was exterminated for food purposes, about 1864, and only four\r\nspecimens are known to be in existence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF THE NORTH AMERICAN\r\nGreat Auk\r\nPallas Cormorant\r\nLabrador Duck\r\nPassenger Pigeon\r\nEskimo Curlew\r\nCuban Tricolor Macaw\r\nGosse's Macaw\r\nGuadeloupe Macaw\r\nYellow Winged Green Parrot\r\nPurple Guadaloupe Parakeet\r\nCarolina Parakeet\r\nEXTERMINATED BY CIVILIZED MAN 1840-1910]\r\n\r\nGOSSE'S MACAW,--_Ara gossei_, (Roth.).--This species once inhabited the\r\nIsland of Jamaica.

The date and history of its disappearance are both\r\nunknown, and there is not one specimen of it in existence.\r\n\r\nYELLOW-WINGED GREEN PARROT,--_Amazona olivacea_, (Gm.).--Of the history\r\nof this Guadeloupe species, also, nothing is known, and there appear to\r\nbe no specimens of it in existence.\r\n\r\nPURPLE GUADELOUPE PARRAKEET,--_Anodorhynchus purpurescens_,\r\n(Rothschild).--This is another dead species, that once lived in the\r\nGuadeloupe Islands, and passed away silently and unnoticed at the time,\r\nleaving no records of its existence, and no specimens.\r\n\r\nTHE CAROLINA PARRAKEET,--_Conuropsis carolinensis_, (Linn.), brings us\r\ndown to the present moment. To this charming little green-and-yellow\r\nbird, we are in the very act of bidding everlasting farewell. Ten\r\nspecimens remain alive in captivity, six of which are in the Cincinnati\r\nZoological Garden, three are in the Washington Zoological Park and one\r\nis in the New York Zoological Park.\r\n\r\nRegarding wild specimens, it is possible that some yet remain, in some\r\nobscure and _neglected_ corner of Florida; but it is extremely doubtful\r\nwhether the world ever will find any of them alive. Mrs. Minnie Moore\r\nWillson, of Kissimee, Fla. reports the species as totally extinct in\r\nFlorida. Unless we would strain at a gnat, we may just as well enter\r\nthis species in the dead class; for there is no reason to hope that any\r\nmore wild specimens ever will be found.\r\n\r\nThe former range of this species embraced the whole southeastern and\r\ncentral United States. From the Gulf it extended to Albany, N.Y.,\r\nnorthern Ohio and Indiana, northern Iowa, Nebraska, central Colorado and\r\neastern Texas, from which it will be seen that once it was widely\r\ndistributed. It was shot because it was destructive to fruit and for its\r\nplumage, and many were trapped alive, to be kept in captivity. I know\r\nthat one colony, near the mouth of the Sebastian River, east coast of\r\nFlorida, was exterminated in 1898 by a local hunter, and I regret to say\r\nthat it was done in the hope of selling the living birds to a New York\r\nbird-dealer. By holding bags over the holes in which the birds were\r\nnesting, the entire colony, of about 16 birds, was caught.\r\n\r\nEverywhere else than in Florida, the Carolina parrakeet has long been\r\nextinct. In 1904 a flock of 13 birds was seen near Lake Okechobee; but\r\nin Florida many calamities can overtake a flock of birds in eight years.\r\nThe birds in captivity are not breeding, and so far as perpetuation by\r\nthem is concerned, they are only one remove from mounted museum\r\nspecimens. This parrakeet is the only member of its order that ranged\r\ninto the United States during our own times, and with its disappearance\r\nthe Order Psittaciformes totally disappears from our country.\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE NEXT CANDIDATES FOR OBLIVION\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the world of human beings, murder is the most serious of all crimes.\r\nTo take from a man that which no one ever can restore to him, his life,\r\nis murder; and its penalty is the most severe of all penalties.\r\n\r\nThere are circumstances under which the killing of a wild animal may be\r\nso wanton, so revolting and so utterly reprehensible that the act may\r\njustly be classed as murder. The man who kills a walrus from the deck of\r\na steamer that he knows will not stop; the man who wantonly killed the\r\nwhole colony of hippopotami that Mr. Dugmore photographed in life; the\r\nman who last winter shot bull elk in Wyoming for their two ugly and\r\nshapeless teeth, and the man who wantonly shot down a half-tame deer\r\n\"for fun\" near Carmel, Putnam County, New York, in the summer of\r\n1912,--all were guilty of _murdering_ wild animals.\r\n\r\nThe murder of a wild animal species consists in taking from it that\r\nwhich man with all his cunning and all his preserves and breeding can\r\nnot give back to it,--its God-given place in the ranks of Living Things.\r\nWhere is man's boasted intelligence, or his sense of proportion, that\r\nevery man does not see the monstrous moral obliquity involved in the\r\ndestruction of a species!\r\n\r\nIf the beautiful Taj Mehal at Agra should be destroyed by vandals, the\r\nintelligent portion of humanity would be profoundly shocked, even though\r\nthe hand of man could at will restore the shrine of sorrowing love.\r\nTo-day the great Indian rhinoceros, certainly one of the most wonderful\r\nfour-footed animals still surviving, is actually being exterminated; and\r\neven the people of India and England are viewing it with an indifference\r\nthat is appalling. Of course there are among Englishmen a great many\r\nsportsmen and several zoologists who really care; but they do not\r\nconstitute one-tenth of one per-cent of the men who ought to care!\r\n\r\nIn the museums, we stand in awe and wonder before the fossil skeleton of\r\nthe Megatherium, and the savants struggle to unveil its past, while the\r\nequally great and marvelous _Rhinoceros indicus_ is being rushed into\r\noblivion. We marvel at the fossil shell of the gigantic turtle called\r\n_Collosochelys atlas_, while the last living representatives of the\r\ngigantic land tortoises are being exterminated in the Galapagos Islands\r\nand the Sychelles, for their paltry oil and meat; and only one man (Hon.\r\nWalter Rothschild) is doing aught to save any of them in their haunts,\r\nwhere they can breed. The dodo of Mauritius was exterminated by swine,\r\nwhose bipedal descendants have exterminated many other species since\r\nthat time.\r\n\r\nA failure to appreciate either the beauty or the value of our living\r\nbirds, quadrupeds and fishes is the hall-mark of arrested mental\r\ndevelopment and ignorance. The victim is _not always to blame_; but in\r\nthis practical world the cornerstone of legal jurisprudence is the\r\ninexorable principle that \"ignorance of the law excuses no man.\"\r\n\r\nThese pages are addressed to my countrymen, and the world at large, not\r\nas a reproach upon the dead Past which is gone beyond recall, but in the\r\nfaint hope of somewhere and somehow arousing forces that will reform the\r\nPresent and save the Future. The extermination of wild species that now\r\nis proceeding throughout the world, is a dreadful thing. It is not only\r\ninjurious to the economy of the world, but it is a shame and a disgrace\r\nto the civilized portion of the human race.\r\n\r\nIt is of little avail that I should here enter into a detailed\r\ndescription of each species that now is being railroaded into oblivion.\r\nThe bookshelves of intelligent men and women are filled with beautiful\r\nand adequate books on birds and quadrupeds, wherein the status of each\r\nspecies may be determined, almost without effort. There is time and\r\nspace only in which to notice the most prominent of the doomed species,\r\nand perhaps discuss a few examples by way of illustration.

It is the only\r\nnew world rival of the numerous large and showy cranes of the old world;\r\nfor the sandhill crane is not in the same class as the white, black and\r\nblue giants of Asia. We will part from our stately _Grus americanus_\r\nwith profound sorrow, for on this continent we ne'er shall see his like\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nThe well-nigh total disappearance of this species has been brought close\r\nhome to us by the fact that there are less than half a dozen individuals\r\nalive in captivity, while in a wild state the bird is so rare as to be\r\nquite unobtainable. For example, for nearly five years an English\r\ngentlemen has been offering $1,000 for a pair, and the most\r\nenterprising bird collector in America has been quite unable to fill the\r\norder. So far as our information extends, the last living specimen\r\ncaptured was taken six or seven years ago. The last wild birds seen and\r\nreported were observed by Ernest Thompson Seton, who saw five below Fort\r\nMcMurray, Saskatchewan, October 16th, 1907, and by John F. Ferry, who\r\nsaw one at Big Quill Lake, Saskatchewan, in June, 1909.\r\n\r\nThe range of this species once covered the eastern two-thirds of the\r\ncontinent of North America. It extended from the Atlantic coast to the\r\nRocky Mountains, and from Great Bear Lake to Florida and Texas. Eastward\r\nof the Mississippi it has for twenty years been totally extinct, and the\r\nlast specimens taken alive were found in Kansas and Nebraska.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHOOPING CRANES IN THE ZOOLOGICAL PARK\r\nVery Soon this Species will Become Totally Extinct.]\r\n\r\nTHE TRUMPETER SWAN.--Six years ago this species was regarded as so\r\nnearly extinct that a doubting ornithological club of Boston refused to\r\nbelieve on hearsay evidence that the New York Zoological Park contained\r\na pair of living birds, and a committee was appointed, to investigate in\r\nperson, and report. Even at that time, skins were worth all the way from\r\n$100 to $150 each; and when swan skins sell at either of those figures\r\nit is because there are people who believe that the species either is on\r\nthe verge of extinction, or has passed it. The pair referred to above\r\nwas acquired in 1900. Since that time, Dr. Leonard C. Sanford procured\r\nin 1910 two living birds from a bird dealer who obtained them on the\r\ncoast of Virginia. We have done our utmost to induce our pair to breed,\r\nbut without any further results than nest-building.\r\n\r\nThe loss of the trumpeter swan (_Olor americanus_) will not be so great,\r\nnor felt so keenly, as the blotting out of the whooping crane. It so\r\nclosely resembles the whistling swan that only an ornithologist can\r\nrecognize the difference, a yellow spot on the side of the upper\r\nmandible, near its base. The whistling swan yet remains in fair numbers,\r\nbut it is to be feared that soon it will go as the trumpeter has gone.\r\n\r\nTHE AMERICAN FLAMINGO, SCARLET IBIS AND ROSEATE SPOONBILL are three of\r\nthe most beautiful and curious water-haunting birds of the tropics. Once\r\nall three species inhabited portions of the southern United States; but\r\nnow all three are gone from our star-spangled bird fauna. The brilliant\r\nscarlet plumage of the flamingo and ibis, and the exquisite pink\r\nrose-color and white of the spoonbill naturally attracted the evil eyes\r\nof the \"milliner's taxidermists\" and other bird-butchers. From Florida\r\nthese birds quickly vanished. The six great breeding colonies of\r\nFlamingoes on Andros Island, Bahamas, have been reduced to two, and from\r\nProf. E.A. Goeldi, of the State Museum Goeldi, Para, Brazil, have come\r\nbitter complaints of the slaughter of scarlet ibises in South America by\r\nplume-hunters in European pay.\r\n\r\nI know not how other naturalists regard the future of the three species\r\nnamed above, but my opinion is that unless the European feather trade is\r\nquickly stopped as to wild plumage, they are absolutely certain to be\r\nshot into total oblivion, within a very few years. The plumage of these\r\nbirds has so much commercial value, for fishermen's flies as well as for\r\nwomen's hats, that the birds will be killed as long as their feathers\r\ncan be sold and any birds remain alive.\r\n\r\nZoologically, the flamingo is the most odd and interesting bird on the\r\nAmerican continent except the emperor penguin. Its beak baffles\r\ndescription, its long legs and webbed feet are a joke, its nesting\r\nhabits are amazing, and its food habits the despair of most\r\nzoological-garden keepers. Millions of flamingos inhabit the shores of a\r\nnumber of small lakes in the interior of equatorial East Africa, but\r\nthat species is not brilliant scarlet all over the neck and head, as is\r\nthe case with our species.\r\n\r\nIf the American flamingo, scarlet ibis and roseate spoonbill, one or all\r\nof them, are to be saved from total extinction, efforts must be made in\r\neach of the countries in which they breed and live. Their preservation\r\nis distinctly a burden upon the countries of South America that lie\r\neastward of the Andes, and on Yucatan, Cuba and the Bahamas. The time\r\nhas come when the Government of the Bahama Islands should sternly forbid\r\nthe killing of any more flamingos, on any pretext whatever; and if the\r\ncapture of living specimens for exhibition purposes militates against\r\nthe welfare of the colonies, _they should forbid that also_.\r\n\r\nTHE UPLAND PLOVER, OR \"BARTRAMIAN SANDPIPER.\"--Apparently this is the\r\nnext shore-bird species that will follow the Eskimo curlew into\r\noblivion. Four years ago,--a long period for a species that is on the\r\nedge of extermination,--Mr. E.H. Forbush[B] wrote of it as follows:\r\n\r\n\"The Bartramian Sandpiper, commonly known as the Upland Plover, a bird\r\nwhich formerly bred on grassy hills all over the State and migrated\r\nsouthward along our coasts in great flocks, is in imminent danger of\r\nextirpation. A few still breed in Worcester and Berkshire Counties, or\r\nNantucket, so there is still a nucleus which, if protected, may save the\r\nspecies. Five reports from localities where this bird formerly bred give\r\nit as nearing extinction, and four as extinct. This is one of the most\r\nuseful of all birds in grass land, feeding largely on grasshoppers and\r\ncutworms. It is one of the finest of all birds for the table. An effort\r\nshould be made at once to save this useful species.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote B: \"Special Report on the Decrease of Certain Birds, and its\r\nCauses.\"--Mass. State Board of Agriculture, 1908.]\r\n\r\nTHE BLACK-CAPPED PETREL, (_Aestrelata hasitata_).--This species is\r\nalready recorded in the A.O.U. \"Check list\" as extinct; but it appears\r\nthat this may not as yet be absolutely true. On January 1, 1912, a\r\nstrange thing happened. A much battered and exhausted black-capped\r\npetrel was picked up alive in Central Park, New York, taken to the\r\nmenagerie, and kept there during the few days that it survived. When it\r\ndied it was sent to the American Museum; and this may easily prove to be\r\nthe last living record for that species. In reality, this species might\r\nas well be listed with those totally extinct. Formerly it ranged from\r\nthe Antilles to Ohio and Ontario, and the causes of its blotting out are\r\nnot yet definitely known.\r\n\r\nThis ocean-going bird once had a wide range overseas in the temperate\r\nareas of the North Atlantic. It is recorded from Ulster County, New\r\nYork, New Hampshire, Kentucky, Ohio, Virginia and Florida. It was about\r\nof the size of the common tern.\r\n\r\nTHE CALIFORNIA CONDOR, (_Gymnogyps californianus_).--I feel that the\r\nexistence of this species hangs on a very slender thread. This is due to\r\nits alarmingly small range, the insignificant number of individuals now\r\nliving, the openness of the species to attack, and the danger of its\r\nextinction by poison. Originally this remarkable bird,--the largest\r\nNorth American bird of prey,--ranged as far northward as the Columbia\r\nRiver, and southward for an unknown distance. Now its range is reduced\r\nto seven counties in southern California, although it is said to extend\r\nfrom Monterey Bay to Lower California, and eastward to Arizona.\r\n\r\nRegarding the present status and the future of this bird, I have been\r\ngreatly disturbed in mind. When a unique and zoologically important\r\nspecies becomes reduced in its geographic range to a small section of a\r\nsingle state, it seems to me quite time for alarm. For some time I have\r\ncounted this bird as one of those threatened with early extermination,\r\nand as I think with good reason. In view of the swift calamities that\r\nnow seem able to fall on species like thunderbolts out of clear skies,\r\nand wipe them off the earth even before we know that such a fate is\r\nimpending, no species of seven-county distribution is safe. Any species\r\nthat is limited to a few counties of a single state is liable to be\r\nwiped out in five years, by poison, or traps, or lack of food.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CALIFORNIA CONDOR\r\nNow Living in the New York Zoological Park.]\r\n\r\nOn order to obtain the best and also the most conservative information\r\nregarding this species, I appealed to the Curator of the Museum of\r\nVertebrate Zoology, of the University of California. Although written in\r\nthe mountain wilds, I promptly received the valuable contribution that\r\nappears below. As a clear, precise and conservative survey of an\r\nimportant species, it is really a model document.\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nTHE STATUS OF THE CALIFORNIA CONDOR IN 1912 _By Joseph Grinnell_\r\n\r\n\"To my knowledge, the California Condor has been definitely observed\r\nwithin the past five years in the following California counties: Los\r\nAngeles, Ventura, Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo, Monterey, Kern, and\r\nTulare. In parts of Ventura, Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo and Kern\r\ncounties the species is still fairly common, for a large bird, probably\r\nequal in numbers to the golden eagle in those regions that are suited to\r\nit. By suitable country I mean cattle-raising, mountainous territory,\r\nof which there are still vast areas, and which are not likely to be put\r\nto any other use for a very long time, if ever, on account of the lack\r\nof water.\r\n\r\n\"While in Kern County last April, I was informed by a reliable man who\r\nlives near the Tejon Rancho that he had counted twenty-five condors in a\r\nsingle day, since January 1 of the present year. These were on the Tejon\r\nRancho, which is an enormous cattle range covering parts of the\r\nTehachapi and San Emigdio Mountains.\r\n\r\n\"Our present state law provides complete protection for the condor and\r\nits eggs; and the State Fish and Game Commission, in granting permits\r\nfor collectors, always adds the phrase--'except the California condor\r\nand its eggs.' I know of two special permits having been issued, but\r\nneither of these were used; that is, no 'specimens' have been taken\r\nsince 1908, as far as I am aware.\r\n\r\n\"In my travels about the state, I have found that practically everyone\r\nknows that the condor is protected. Still, there is always the hunting\r\nelement who do not hesitate to shoot anything alive and out of the\r\nordinary, and a certain percentage of the condors are doubtless picked\r\noff each year by such criminals. It is possible, also, that the\r\nmercenary egg-collector continues to take his annual rents, though if\r\nthis is done it is kept very quiet. It is my impression that the present\r\nfatalities from all sources are fully balanced by the natural rate of\r\nincrease.\r\n\r\n\"There is one factor that has militated against the condor more than any\r\nother one thing; namely, the restriction in its food source. Its forage\r\nrange formerly included most of the great valleys adjacent to its\r\nmountain retreats. But now the valleys are almost entirely devoted to\r\nagriculture, and of course far more thickly settled than formerly.\r\n\r\n\"The mountainous areas where the condor is making its last stand seem to\r\nme likely to remain adapted to the bird's existence for many\r\nyears,--fifty years, if not longer. Of course, this is conditional upon\r\nthe maintenance and enforcement of the present laws. There is also the\r\nenlightenment of public sentiment in regard to the preservation of wild\r\nlife, which I believe can be depended upon. This is a matter of general\r\neducation, which is, fortunately, and with no doubt whatever,\r\nprogressing at a quite perceptible rate.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; I should say that the condor has a fair chance to survive, in\r\nlimited numbers.\r\n\r\n\"Another bird which in my opinion is far nearer extinction than the\r\ncondor, so far as California is concerned, is the white-tailed kite.\r\nThis is a perfectly harmless bird, but one which harries over the\r\nmarshes, where it has been an easy target for the idle duck-hunter.\r\nThen, too, its range was limited to the valley bottoms, where human\r\nsettlement is increasingly close. I know of only _two_ live pairs within\r\nthe state last year!\r\n\r\n\"Finally, let me remark that the rate of increase of the California\r\ncondor is not one whit less than that of the band-tailed pigeon! Yet,\r\nthere is no protection at all for the latter in this state, even in the\r\nnesting season; and thousands were shot last spring, in the\r\nunprecedented concentration of the species in the southern coast\r\ncounties. (See Chambers in _The Condor_ for May, 1912, p. 108.)\"\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nThe California Condor is one of the only two species of condor now\r\nliving, and it is the only one found in North America. As a matter of\r\nnational pride, and a duty to posterity, the people of the United States\r\ncan far better afford to lose a million dollars from their national\r\ntreasury than to allow that bird to become extinct. Its preservation for\r\nall coming time is distinctly a white man's burden upon the state of\r\nCalifornia. The laws now in force for the condor's protection are not\r\nhalf adequate! I think there is no law by which the accidental poisoning\r\nof those birds, by baits put out for coyotes and foxes, can be stopped.\r\nA law to prevent the use of poisoned meat baits anywhere in southern\r\nCalifornia, should be enacted at the next session of California's\r\nlegislature. The fine for molesting a condor should be raised to $500,\r\nwith a long prison-term as an alternative. A competent, interested game\r\nwarden should be appointed _solely for the protection of the condors_.\r\nIt is time to count those birds, keep them under observation, and have\r\nan annual report upon their condition.\r\n\r\nTHE HEATH HEN.--But for the protection that has been provided for it by\r\nthe ornithologists of Massachusetts, and particularly Dr. George W.\r\nField, William Brewster and John E. Thayer, the heath hen or eastern\r\npinnated grouse would years ago have become totally extinct. New York,\r\nNew Jersey and Massachusetts began to protect that species entirely too\r\nlate. It was given five-year close seasons, without avail. Then it was\r\ngiven ten-year close seasons, but it was _too late_!\r\n\r\nTo-day, the species exists only in one locality, the island of Martha's\r\nVineyard, and concerning its present status, Mr. Forbush has recently\r\nfurnished us the following clear statement:\r\n\r\n  \"The heath hens increased for two years after the Massachusetts Fish\r\n  and Game Commission established a reservation for them, but in 1911\r\n  they had not increased. There are probably about two hundred birds\r\n  extant.\r\n\r\n  \"I found a great many marsh hawks on the Island and the Commission\r\n  did not kill them, believing them to be beneficial. In watching\r\n  them, I concluded that they were catching the young heath hens. A\r\n  large number of these hawks have been shot and their stomachs sent\r\n  to Washington for examination, as I was too busy at the time to\r\n  examine them. So far as I know, no report of the examination has\r\n  been made, but Dr. Field himself examined a few of the stomachs and\r\n  found the remains of the heath hen in some.\r\n\r\n  \"The warden now says that during the past two years, the heath hen\r\n  has not increased, but I can give you no definite evidence of this.\r\n  I am quite sure they are being killed by natives of the island and\r\n  that at least one collector supplies birds for museums. We are\r\n  trying to get evidence of this.\r\n\r\n  \"I believe if the heath hen is to be increased in numbers and brought\r\n  back to this country, we shall have to have more than one warden on\r\n  the reservation and, eventually, we shall have to establish the bird\r\n  on the mainland also.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PINNATED GROUSE, OR \"PRAIRIE CHICKEN\"\r\nFrom the \"American Natural History\"]\r\n\r\nTHE PINNATED GROUSE, SAGE GROUSE AND PRAIRIE SHARP-TAIL.--In view of the\r\nfate of the grouse of the United States, as it has been wrought out thus\r\nfar in all the more thickly settled areas, and particularly in view of\r\nthe history of the heath hen, we have no choice but to regard all three\r\nof the species named above as absolutely certain to become totally\r\nextinct, within a short period of years, unless the conditions\r\nsurrounding them are immediately and radically changed for the better.\r\nPersonally, I do not believe that the gunners and game-hogs of\r\nMinnesota, Montana, Nebraska, Idaho, Washington, Oregon and California\r\nwill permit any one of those species to be saved.\r\n\r\nIf the present open seasons prevail in the states that I have mentioned\r\nabove, no power on earth can save those three species of grouse from the\r\nfate of the heath hen. To-day their representatives exist only in small\r\nshreds and patches, and from fully nineteen-twentieths of their original\r\nranges they are forever gone.\r\n\r\nThe sage grouse will be the first species to go. It is the largest, the\r\nmost conspicuous, the one most easily found, and the biggest mark for\r\nthe gunner. Those who have seen this bird in its native sage-brush well\r\nunderstand how fatally it is exposed to slaughter.\r\n\r\nMany appeals have been made in behalf of the pinnated grouse; but the\r\nopen seasons continue. The gunners of the states in which a few remnants\r\nstill exist are determined to have them, all; and the state legislatures\r\nseem disposed to allow the killers to have their way. It may be\r\nhowever, that like New York with the heath hen, they will arouse and\r\nvirtuously lock the stable door--after the horse has been stolen!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SAGE GROUSE\r\nThe First of the Upland Game Birds that will Become Extinct]\r\n\r\nTHE SNOWY EGRET AND AMERICAN EGRET, (_Egretta candidissima and Herodias\r\negretta_).--These unfortunate birds, cursed for all time by the\r\ncommercially valuable \"aigrette\" plumes that they bear, have had a very\r\nnarrow escape from total extinction in the United States, despite all\r\nthe efforts made to save them. The \"plume-hunters\" of the millinery\r\ntrade have been, _and still are_, determined to have the last feather\r\nand the last drop of egret blood. In an effort to stop the slaughter in\r\nat least one locality in Florida, Warden Guy Bradley was killed by a\r\nplume-hunter, who of course escaped all punishment through the\r\nheaven-born \"sympathy\" of a local jury.\r\n\r\nOf the bloody egret slaughter in Florida, not one-tenth of the whole\r\nstory ever has been told. Millions of adult birds,--all there\r\nwere,--were killed _in the breeding season_, when the plumes were ripe\r\nfor the market; and millions of young birds starved in their nests. It\r\nwas a common thing for a rookery of several hundred birds to be attacked\r\nby the plume-hunters, and in two or three days utterly destroyed. The\r\nsame bloody work is going on to-day in Venezuela and Brazil; and the\r\nstories and \"affidavits\" stating that the millions of egret plumes being\r\nshipped annually from those countries are \"shed feathers,\" \"picked up\r\noff the ground,\" are absolute lies. The men who have sworn to those lies\r\nare perjurers, and should be punished for their crimes. (See Chapter\r\nXIII).\r\n\r\nBy 1908, the plume-hunters had so far won the fight for the egrets that\r\nFlorida had been swept almost as bare of these birds as the Colorado\r\ndesert.\r\n\r\nUntil Mr. E.A. McIlhenny's egret preserve, at Avery Island, Louisiana,\r\nbecame a pronounced success, we had believed that our two egrets soon\r\nwould become totally extinct in the United States. But Mr. McIlhenny has\r\ncertainly saved those birds to our fauna. In 1892 he started an egret\r\nand heron preserve, close beside his house on Avery Island. By 1900 it\r\nwas an established success. To-day 20,000 pairs of egrets and herons are\r\nliving and breeding in that bird refuge, and the two egret species are\r\nsafe in at least one spot in our own country.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SNOWY EGRETS IN THE McILHENNY EGRET PRESERVE\r\nIt is at This Period That the Parent Birds are Killed for Their Plumes,\r\nand the Young Starve in the Nest\r\nPhoto by E.A. McIlhenny]\r\n\r\nThree years ago, I think there were not many bird-lovers in the United\r\nStates, who believed it possible to prevent the total extinction of both\r\negrets from our fauna. All the known rookeries accessible to\r\nplume-hunters had been totally destroyed. Two years ago, the secret\r\ndiscovery of several small, hidden colonies prompted William Dutcher,\r\nPresident of the National Association of Audubon Societies, and Mr. T.\r\nGilbert Pearson, Secretary, to attempt the protection of those colonies.\r\nWith a fund contributed for the purpose, wardens were hired and duly\r\ncommissioned. As previously stated, one of those wardens was shot dead\r\nin cold blood by a plume hunter. The task of guarding swamp rookeries\r\nfrom the attacks of money-hungry desperadoes to whom the accursed plumes\r\nwere worth their weight in gold, is a very chancy proceeding. There is\r\nnow one warden in Florida who says that \"before they get my rookery they\r\nwill first have to get me.\"\r\n\r\nThus far the protective work of the Audubon Association has been\r\nsuccessful. Now there are twenty colonies, which contain all told, about\r\n5,000 egrets and about 120,000 herons and ibises which are guarded by\r\nthe Audubon wardens. One of the most important is on Bird Island, a mile\r\nout in Orange Lake, central Florida, and it is ably defended by Oscar E.\r\nBaynard. To-day, the plume hunters who do not dare to raid the guarded\r\nrookeries are trying to study out the lines of flight of the birds, to\r\nand from their feeding-grounds, and shoot them in transit. Their motto\r\nis--\"Anything to beat the law, and get the plumes.\" It is there that the\r\nstate of Florida should take part in the war.\r\n\r\nThe success of this campaign is attested by the fact that last year a\r\nnumber of egrets were seen in eastern Massachusetts--for the first time\r\nin many years. And so to-day the question is, can the wardens continue\r\nto hold the plume-hunters at bay?\r\n\r\nTHE WOOD-DUCK (_Aix sponsa_), by many bird-lovers regarded as the most\r\nbeautiful of all American birds, is threatened with extinction, in all\r\nthe states that it still inhabits with the exception of eight. Long ago\r\n(1901) the U.S. Biological Survey sounded a general alarm for this\r\nspecies by the issue of a special bulletin regarding its disappearance,\r\nand advising its protection by long close seasons. To their everlasting\r\nhonor, eight states responded, by the enactment of long close-season\r\nlaws. This, is the\r\n\r\nROLL OF HONOR\r\n\r\nCONNECTICUT\r\nMAINE\r\nMASSACHUSETTS\r\nNEW HAMPSHIRE\r\nNEW JERSEY\r\nNEW YORK\r\nVERMONT\r\nWEST VIRGINIA\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WOOD DUCK\r\nRegularly Killed as \"Food\" in 15 States]\r\n\r\nAnd how is it with the other states that number the wood-duck in their\r\navian faunas? I am ashamed to tell; but it is necessary that the truth\r\nshould be known.\r\n\r\nSurely we will find that if the other states have not the grace to\r\nprotect this bird on account of its exquisite beauty they will not\r\npenalize it by extra long open seasons.\r\n\r\n_A number of them have taken pains to provide extra long_ OPEN _seasons\r\non this species, usually of five or six months!!_ And this for a bird so\r\nexquisitely beautiful that shooting it for the table is like dining on\r\nbirds of paradise. Here is a partial list of them:\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nWOOD-DUCK-EATING STATES (1912)\r\n\r\nGeorgia kills and eats the Wood-duck from Sept. 1, to Feb. 1.\r\nIndiana, Iowa and Kansas      do so    \"  Sept. 1, to Apr. 15.\r\nKentucky, (extra long!)     does so    \"  Aug. 15, to Apr. 1.\r\nLouisiana (extra long!)       \"   \"    \"  Sept. 1, to Mar. 1.\r\nMaryland                      \"   \"    \"  Nov. 1, to Apr. 1.\r\nMichigan                      \"   \"    \"  Oct. 15, to Jan. 1.\r\nNebraska (extra long!)        \"   \"    \"  Sept. 1, to Apr. 1.\r\nOhio                          \"   \"    \"  Sept. 1, to Jan. 1.\r\nPennsylvania, (extra long!)   \"   \"    \"  Sept. 1, to Apr. 11.\r\nRhode Island,    \"     \"      \"   \"    \"  Aug. 15, to Apr. 1.\r\nSouth Carolina   \"     \"      \"   \"    \"  Sept. 1, to Mar. 1.\r\nSouth Dakota     \"     \"      \"   \"    \"  Sept. 10, to Apr. 10.\r\nTennessee        \"     \"      \"   \"    \"  Aug. 1, to Apr. 15.\r\nVirginia                      \"   \"    \"  Aug. 1, to Jan. 1.\r\nWisconsin                     \"   \"    \"  Sept. 1, to Jan. 1.\r\n\r\nThe above are the states that really possess the wood-duck and that\r\nshould give it, one and all, a series of five-year close seasons. Now,\r\nis not the record something to blush for?\r\n\r\nIs there in those fifteen states _nothing_ too beautiful or too good to\r\ngo into the pot?\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nTHE WOODCOCK _(Philohela minor)_, is a bird regarding which my\r\nbird-hunting friends and I do not agree. I say that as a species it is\r\nsteadily disappearing, and presently will become extinct, unless it is\r\naccorded better protection. They reply: \"Well, I can show you where\r\nthere are woodcock yet!\"\r\n\r\nA few months ago a Nova Scotian writer in _Forest and Stream_ came out\r\nwith the bold prediction that three more years of the usual annual\r\nslaughter of woodcock will bring the species to the verge of extinction\r\nin that Province.\r\n\r\nIt is such occurrences as this that bring the end of a species:\r\n\r\n\"Last fall [1911, at Norwalk, Conn.] we had a good flight of woodcock,\r\nand it is a shame the way they were slaughtered. I know of a number of\r\ncases where twenty were killed by one gun in the day, and heard of one\r\ncase of fifty. This is all wrong, and means the end of the woodcock, if\r\ncontinued. There is no doubt we need a bag limit on woodcock, as much as\r\non quail or partridge.\" (\"Woodcock\" in _Forest and Stream_, Mar. 2,\r\n1912.)\r\n\r\nAs far back as 1901, Dr. A.K. Fisher of the Biological Survey predicted\r\nthat the woodcock and wood-duck would both become extinct unless better\r\nprotected. As yet, the better protection demanded has not materialized\r\nto any great extent.\r\n\r\nSays Mr. Forbush, State Ornithologist of Massachusetts, in his admirable\r\n\"Special Report,\" p. 45:\r\n\r\n\"The woodcock is decreasing all over its range in the East, and needs\r\nthe strongest protection. Of thirty-eight Massachusetts reports,\r\nthirty-six state that \"woodcock are decreasing,\" \"rare\" or \"extinct,\"\r\nwhile one states that they are holding their own, and one that they are\r\nincreasing slightly since the law was passed prohibiting their sale.\"\r\n\r\nLet not any honest American or Canadian sportsman lullaby himself into\r\nthe belief that the woodcock is safe from extermination. As sure as the\r\nworld, it is _going_! The fact that a little pocket here or there\r\ncontains a few birds does not in the slightest degree disprove the main\r\nfact. If the sportsmen of this country desire to save the seed stock of\r\nwoodcock, they must give it _everywhere_ five or ten-year close seasons,\r\nand _do it immediately_!\r\n\r\nOUR SHORE BIRDS IN GENERAL.--This group of game birds will be the first\r\nto be exterminated in North America as a _group_. Of all our birds,\r\nthese are the most illy fitted to survive. They are very conspicuous,\r\nvery unwary, easy to find if alive, and easy to shoot. Never in my life\r\nhave any shore birds except woodcock and snipe appealed to me as real\r\ngame. They are too easy to kill, too trivial when killed, and some of\r\nthem are too rank and fishy on the plate. As game for men I place them\r\non a level with barnyard ducks or orchard turkeys. I would as soon be\r\ncaught stealing a sheep as to be seen trying to shoot fishy yellow legs\r\nor little joke sandpipers for the purpose of feeding upon them. And yet,\r\nthousands of full-grown men, some of them six feet high, grow indignant\r\nand turn red in the face at the mention of a law to give all the\r\nshore-birds of New York a five-year close season.\r\n\r\nBut for all that, gentlemen of the gun, there are exactly two\r\nalternatives between which you shall choose:\r\n\r\n(1) Either give the woodcock of the eastern United States just _ten\r\ntimes_ the protection that it now has, or (2) bid the species a long\r\nfarewell. If you elect to slaughter old _Philohela minor_ on the altar\r\nof Selfishness, then it will be in order for the millions of people who\r\ndo not kill birds to say whether that proposal shall be consummated or\r\nnot.\r\n\r\nRead if you please Mr. W.A. McAtee's convincing pamphlet (Biological\r\nSurvey, No. 79), on \"Our Vanishing Shore Birds,\" reproduced in full in\r\nChapter XXIII. He says: \"Throughout the eastern United States, shore\r\nbirds are fast vanishing. Many of them have been so reduced that\r\n_extermination seems imminent_. So averse to shore birds are present\r\nconditions [of slaughter] that the wonder is that any escape. All the\r\nshore birds of the United States are in great need of better\r\nprotection.... Shore birds have been hunted until only a remnant of\r\ntheir once vast numbers are left. Their limited powers of reproduction,\r\ncoupled with the natural vicissitudes of the breeding period, make their\r\nincrease slow, and peculiarly expose them to danger of extermination. So\r\ngreat is their economic value that their retention in the game list and\r\ntheir destruction by sportsmen is a serious loss to agriculture.\"\r\n\r\nAnd yet, here in New York state there are many men who think they\r\n\"know,\" who indignantly scoff at the idea that our shore birds need a\r\nfive-year close season to help save them from annihilation. The writer's\r\nappeal for this at a recent convention of the New York State Fish, Game\r\nand Forest League fell upon deaf ears, and was not even seriously\r\ndiscussed.\r\n\r\nThe shore-birds must be saved; and just at present it seems that the\r\nonly persons who will do it are those who are _not_ sportsmen, and who\r\nnever kill game! If the sportsmen persist in refusing to act, to them we\r\nmust appeal.\r\n\r\nBesides the woodcock and snipe, the species that are most seriously\r\nthreatened with extinction at an early date are the following:\r\n\r\nSPECIES IN GREAT DANGER\r\n\r\nWillet                           _Catoptrophorus semipalmatus_\r\nDowitcher                        _Macrorhamphus griseus_\r\nKnot: Red-Breasted Sandpiper     _Tryngites subruficollis_\r\nUpland Plover                    _Bartramia longicauda_\r\nGolden Plover                    _Charadrius dominicus_\r\nPectoral Sandpiper               _Pisobia maculata_\r\n\r\nOf these fine species, Mr. Forbush, whose excellent knowledge of the\r\nshore birds of the Atlantic coast is well worth the most serious\r\nconsideration, says that the upland plover, or Bartramian sandpiper, \"is\r\nin imminent danger of extinction. Five reports from localities where\r\nthis bird formerly bred give it as nearing extinction, and four as\r\nextinct. This is one of the most useful of all birds in grass land,\r\nfeeding largely on grasshoppers and cutworms.... There is no difference\r\nof opinion in regard to the diminution of the shore birds; the reports\r\nfrom all quarters are the same. It is noteworthy that practically all\r\nobservers agree that, considering all species, these birds have fallen\r\noff about 75 per cent within twenty-five to forty years, and that\r\nseveral species are nearly extirpated.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GRAY SQUIRREL, A FAMILIAR FRIEND WHEN PROTECTED]\r\n\r\nIn 1897 when the Zoological Society published my report on the\r\n\"Extermination of Our Birds and Mammals,\" we put down the decrease in\r\nthe volume of bird life in Massachusetts during the previous fifteen\r\nyears at twenty-seven per cent. The later and more elaborate\r\ninvestigations of Mr. Forbush have satisfactorily vindicated the\r\naccuracy of that estimate.\r\n\r\nThere are other North American birds that easily might be added to the\r\nlist of those now on the road to oblivion; but surely the foregoing\r\ncitations are sufficient to reveal the present desperate conditions of\r\nour bird life in general. Now the question is: What are the great\r\nAmerican people going to do about it?\r\n\r\nTHE GRAY SQUIRREL.--The gray squirrel is in danger of extermination.\r\nAlthough it is our most beautiful and companionable small wild animal,\r\nand really unfit for food, Americans have strangely elected to class it\r\nas \"game,\" and shoot it to death, _to eat_! And this in stall-fed\r\nAmerica, in the twentieth century! Americans are the only white people\r\nin the world who eat squirrels. It would be just as reasonable, and no\r\nmore barbarous, to kill domestic cats and eat them. Their flesh would\r\ntaste quite as good as squirrel flesh and some of them would afford\r\nquite as good \"sport.\"\r\n\r\nEvery intelligent person knows that in the United States the deadly\r\nshot-gun is rapidly exterminating every bird and every small mammal that\r\nis classed as \"game,\" and which legally may be killed, even during two\r\nmonths of the twelve. The market gunners slaughter ducks, grouse, shore\r\nbirds and rabbits as if we were all starving.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful gray squirrel has clung to life in a few of our forests\r\nand wood-lots, long after most other wild mammals have disappeared; but\r\nthroughout at least ninety-five per cent, of its original area, it is\r\nnow extinct. During the past thirty years I have roamed the woods of my\r\nstate in several widely separated localities,--the Adirondacks,\r\nCatskills, Berkshires, western New York and elsewhere, and in all that\r\ntime I have seen only _three_ wild gray squirrels outside of city parks.\r\n\r\nExcept over a very small total area, the gray squirrel is already gone\r\nfrom the wild fauna of New York State!\r\n\r\nDo the well-fed people of America wish to have this beautiful animal\r\nentirely exterminated? Do they wish the woods to become wholly lifeless?\r\nOr, do they desire to bring back some of the wild creatures, and keep\r\nthem for their children to enjoy?\r\n\r\nThere is no wild mammal that responds to protection more quickly than\r\nthe gray squirrel. In two years' time, wild specimens that are set free\r\nin city parks learn that they are safe from harm and become almost\r\nfearless. They take food from the hands of visitors, and climb into\r\ntheir arms. One of the most pleasing sights of the Zoological Park is\r\nthe enjoyment of visitors, young and old, in \"petting\" our wild gray\r\nsquirrels.\r\n\r\nWe ask the Boy Scouts of America to bring back this animal to each state\r\nwhere it belongs, by securing for it from legislatures and governors the\r\nperpetual closed seasons that it imperatively needs. It is not much to\r\nask. This can be done by writing to members of the legislatures and\r\nrequesting a suitable law. Such a request will be both right and\r\nreasonable; and three states have already granted it.\r\n\r\nThe gray squirrel is naturally the children's closest wild-animal\r\nfriend. Surely every farmer boy would like to have colonies of gray\r\nsquirrels around him, to keep him company, and furnish him with\r\nentertainment. A wood-lot without squirrels and chipmunks is indeed a\r\nlifeless place. For $20 anyone can restock any bit of woods with the\r\nmost companionable and most beautiful tree-dweller that nature has given\r\nus.\r\n\r\nThe question now is, which will you choose--a gray squirrel colony to\r\nevery farm, or lifeless desolation?\r\n\r\nWe ask every American to lend a hand to save Silver-Tail.\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nEXTINCT AND NEARLY EXTINCT SPECIES OF MAMMALS\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen we pause and consider the years, the generations and the ages that\r\nNature spends in the production of a high vertebrate species, the\r\npreservation of such species from extermination should seriously concern\r\nus. As a matter of fact, in modern man's wild chase after wealth and\r\npleasure, it is only one person out of every ten thousand who pauses to\r\nregard such causes, unless cornered by some protectionist fanatic, held\r\nfast and coerced to listen.\r\n\r\nWe are not discussing the animals of the Pleistocene, or the Eocene, or\r\nany period of the far-distant Past. We are dealing with species that\r\nhave been ruthlessly, needlessly and wickedly destroyed by man during\r\nour own times; species that, had they been given a fair chance, would be\r\nalive and well to-day.\r\n\r\nIn reckless waste of blood and treasure, the nineteenth century has much\r\nfor which to answer. Wars and pillage, fires, earthquakes and volcanoes\r\nare unhappily unavoidable. Like the poor of holy writ, we have them with\r\nus always. But the destruction of animal life is in a totally different\r\ncategory from the accidental calamities of life. It is deliberate,\r\ncold-blooded, persistent, and in its final stage, _criminal_! Worst of\r\nall, there is no limit to the devilish persistence of the confirmed\r\ndestroyer, this side of the total extinction of species. No polar night\r\nis too cold, no desert inferno is too hot for the man who pursues wild\r\nlife for commercial purposes. The rhytina has been exterminated in the\r\nfar north, the elephant seals on Kerguelen are being exterminated in the\r\nfar south, and midway, in the desert mountains of Lower California a\r\nfine species of mountain sheep is rapidly being shot into oblivion.\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nLARGE MAMMALS COMPLETELY EXTERMINATED\r\n\r\nTHE ARIZONA ELK, (_Cervus merriami_).--Right at our very door, under our\r\nvery noses and as it were only yesterday, a well-defined species of\r\nAmerican elk has been totally exterminated. Until recently the mountains\r\nof Arizona and New Mexico were inhabited by a light-colored elk of\r\nsmaller size than the Wyoming species, whose antlers possessed on each\r\nside only one brow tine instead of two. The exact history of the\r\nblotting out of that species has not yet been written, but it seems that\r\nits final extinction occurred about 1901. Its extermination was only a\r\nroutine incident of the devilish general slaughter of American big game\r\nthat by 1900 had wiped out nearly everything killable over a large\r\nportion of the Rocky Mountain region and the Great Plains.\r\n\r\nThe Arizona elk was exterminated before the separate standing of the\r\nspecies had been discovered by naturalists, and before even _one_ skin\r\nhad been preserved in a museum! In 1902 Mr. E.W. Nelson described the\r\nspecies from two male skulls, all the material of which he knew. Since\r\nthat time, a third male skull, bearing an excellent pair of antlers, has\r\nbeen discovered by Mr. Ferdinand Kaegebehn, a member of the New York\r\nZoological Society, and presented to our National Collection of Heads\r\nand Horns. It came from the Santa Catalina Mountains, Arizona, in 1884.\r\nThe species was first exterminated in the central and northern mountains\r\nof Arizona, probably twenty years ago, and made its last stand in\r\nnorthwestern New Mexico. Precisely when it became extinct there, its\r\nlast abiding place, we do not know, but in time the facts may appear.\r\n\r\nTHE QUAGGA, (_Equus quagga_).--Before the days of Livingstone,\r\nGordon-Cumming and Anderson, the grassy plains and half-forested hills\r\nof South Africa were inhabited by great herds of a wild equine species\r\nthat in its markings was a sort of connecting link between the striped\r\nzebras and the stripeless wild asses. The quagga resembled a wild ass\r\nwith a few zebra stripes around its neck, and no stripes elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThere is no good reason why a mammal that is not in any one of the\r\nfamilies regularly eaten by man should be classed as a game animal.\r\nWhite men, outside of the western border of the continent of Europe, do\r\nnot eat horses; and by this token there is no reason why a zebra should\r\nbe shot as a \"game\" animal, any more than a baboon. A big male baboon is\r\ndangerous; a male zebra is not.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, white men have elected to shoot zebras as game; and under\r\nthis curse the unfortunate quagga fell to rise no more. The species was\r\nshot to a speedy death by sportsmen, and by the British and Dutch\r\nfarmers of South Africa. It became extinct about 1875, and to-day there\r\nare only 18 specimens in all the museums of the world.\r\n\r\nTHE BLAUBOK, (_Hippotragus leucophaeus_).--The first of the African\r\nantelopes to become extinct in modern times was a species of large size,\r\nclosely related to the roan antelope of to-day, and named by the early\r\nDutch settlers of Cape Colony the blaubok, which means \"blue-buck.\" It\r\nwas snuffed out of existence in the year 1800, so quickly and so\r\nthoroughly that, like the Arizona elk, it very nearly escaped the annals\r\nof natural history. According to the careful investigations of Mr.\r\nGraham Renshaw, there are only eight specimens in existence in all the\r\nmuseums of Europe. In general terms it may be stated that this species\r\nhas been extinct for about a century.\r\n\r\nDAVID'S DEER, (_Elaphurus davidianus_).--We enter this species with\r\nthose that are totally extinct, because this is true of it so far as its\r\nwild state is concerned. It is a deer nearly as large as the red deer of\r\nEurope, with 3-tined antlers about equal in total length to those of the\r\nred deer. Its most striking differential character is its _long tail_, a\r\nfeature that among the deer of the world is quite unique.\r\n\r\nOriginally this species inhabited \"northern Mongolia\" (China), but in a\r\nwild state it became extinct before its zoological standing became known\r\nto the scientific world. The species was called to the attention of\r\nzoologists by a Roman Catholic missionary, called Father David, and when\r\nfinally described it was named in his honor.\r\n\r\nAt the outbreak of the Boxer Rebellion, in 1900, there were about 200\r\nspecimens living in the imperial park of China, a short distance south\r\nof Pekin; but during the rebellion, all of them were killed and eaten,\r\nthus totally exterminating the species from Asia.\r\n\r\nFortunately, previous to that calamity (in 1894), the Duke of Bedford\r\nhad by considerable effort and expenditure procured and established in\r\nhis matchless park surrounding Woburn Abbey, England, a herd of eighteen\r\nspecimens of this rarest of all deer. That nucleus has thriven and\r\nincreased, until in 1910 it contained thirty-four head. Owing to the\r\nfact that all the living female specimens of this remarkable species are\r\nconcentrated in one spot, and perfectly liable to be wiped out in one\r\nyear by riot, war or disease, there is some cause for anxiety. The\r\nwriter has gone so far as to suggest the desirability of starting a new\r\nherd of David's deer, at some point far distant from England, as an\r\ninsurance measure against the possibility of calamity at Woburn.\r\nExcepting two or three specimens in European zoological gardens that\r\nhave been favored by the Duke of Bedford, there are no living specimens\r\noutside of Woburn Park.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SKELETON OF A RHYTINA, OR ARCTIC SEA-COW\r\nIn the United States National Museum]\r\n\r\nTHE RHYTINA, (_Rhytina gigas_).--The most northerly Sirenian that (so\r\nfar as we know) ever inhabited the earth, lived on the Commander Islands\r\nin the northern end of Behring Sea, and was exterminated by man, for its\r\noil and its flesh, about 1768. It was first made known to the world by\r\nSteller, in 1741, and must have become extinct near the beginning of the\r\nnineteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe rhytina belonged to the same mammalian Order as the manatee of\r\nFlorida and South America, and the dugong of Australia. The largest\r\nmanatee that Florida has produced, so far as we know, was thirteen feet\r\nlong. The rhytina attained a length of between thirty and thirty-five\r\nfeet, and a weight of 6,000 pounds or over. The flesh of this animal,\r\nlike that of the manatee and dugong, must have been edible, and surely\r\nwas prized by the hungry sailors and natives of its time. It is not\r\nstrange that such a species was quickly exterminated by man, in the\r\narctic regions. The wonder is that it ever existed at a latitude so\r\noutrageous for a Sirenian, an animal which by all precedents should\r\nprefer life in temperate or warm waters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BURCHELL'S ZEBRA, IN THE U.S. NATIONAL MUSEUM\r\nNow Believed to be Totally Extinct]\r\n\r\nBURCHELL'S ZEBRA (_Equus burchelli typicus_).--The foundation type of\r\nwhat now is the Burchell group of zebras, consisting of four or five\r\nsub-species of the original species of _burchelli_, is an animal\r\nabundantly striped as to its body, neck and head, but with legs that are\r\nalmost white and free from stripes. The sub-species have legs that are\r\nstriped about half as much as the mountain zebra and the Grevy species.\r\n\r\nWhile there are Chapman zebras and Grant zebras in plenty, and of\r\nCrawshay's not a few, all these are forms that have developed northward\r\nof the range of the parent species, the original _Equus burchelli_. For\r\nhalf a century in South Africa the latter had been harried and driven\r\nand shot, and now it is gone, forever. Now, the museum people of the\r\nworld are hungrily enumerating their mounted specimens, and live ones\r\ncannot be procured with money, because there are none! Already it is\r\ncommon talk that \"the true Burchell zebra is extinct;\" and unfortunately\r\nthere is no good reason to doubt it. Even if there are a few now living\r\nin some remote nook of the Transvaal, or Zululand, or Portuguese East\r\nAfrica, the chances are as 100 to 1 that they will not be suffered to\r\nbring back the species; and so, to Burchell's zebra, the world is to-day\r\nsaying \"Farewell!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THYLACINE OR TASMANIAN WOLF\r\nNow Being Exterminated by the Sheep Owners of Tasmania]\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nSPECIES OF LARGE MAMMALS ALMOST EXTINCT\r\n\r\nTHE THYLACINE or TASMANIAN WOLF, (_Thylacinus cynocephalus_).--Four\r\nyears ago, when Mr. W.H.D. Le Souef, Director of the Melbourne\r\nZoological Garden (Australia), stood before the cage of the living\r\nthylacine in the New York Zoological Park, he first expressed surprise\r\nat the sight of the animal, then said:\r\n\r\n\"I advise you to take excellent care of that specimen; for when it is\r\ngone, you never will get another. The species soon will be extinct.\"\r\n\r\nThis opinion has been supported, quite independently, by a lady who is\r\nthe highest authority on the present status of that species, Mrs. Mary\r\nG. Roberts, of Hobart, Tasmania. For nearly ten years Mrs. Roberts has\r\nbeen procuring all the living specimens of the thylacine that money\r\ncould buy, and attempting to breed them at her private zoo. She states\r\nthat the mountain home of this animal is now occupied by flocks of\r\nsheep, and because of the fact that the \"Tasmanian wolves\" raid the\r\nflocks and kill lambs, the sheep-owners and herders are systematically\r\npoisoning the thylacines as fast as possible. Inasmuch as the species is\r\nlimited to Tasmania, Mrs. Roberts and others fear that the sheepmen\r\nwill totally exterminate the remnant at an early date. This animal is\r\nthe largest and also the most interesting carnivorous marsupial of\r\nAustralia, and its untimely end will be a cause for sincere regret.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WEST INDIAN SEAL\r\nIn the New York Aquarium]\r\n\r\nTHE WEST INDIAN SEAL, (_Monachus tropicalis_).--For at least fifty\r\nyears, all the zoologists who ever had heard of this species believed\r\nthat the oil-hunters had completely exterminated it. In 1885, when the\r\nNational Museum came into possession of one poorly-mounted skin, from\r\nProfessor Poey, of Havana, it was regarded as a great _prize_.\r\n\r\nMost unexpectedly, in 1886 American zoologists were startled by the\r\ndiscovery of a small herd on the Triangle Islands, in the Caribbean Sea,\r\nnear Yucatan, by Mr. Henry L. Ward, now director of the Milwaukee Public\r\nMuseum, and Professor Ferrari, of the National Museum of Mexico. They\r\nfound about twenty specimens, and collected only a sufficient number to\r\nestablish the true character of the species.\r\n\r\nSince that time, four living specimens have been captured, and sent to\r\nthe New York Aquarium, where they lived for satisfactory periods. The\r\nindoor life and atmosphere did not seem to injure the natural vitality\r\nof the animals. In fact, I think they were far more lively in the\r\nAquarium than were the sluggish creatures that Mr. Ward saw on the\r\nTriangle reefs, and described in his report of the expedition.\r\n\r\nIt is quite possible that there are yet alive a few specimens of this\r\nodd species; but the Damocletian sword of destruction hangs over them\r\nsuspended by a fine hair, and it is to be expected that in the future\r\nsome roving sea adventurer will pounce upon the Remnant, and wipe it\r\nout of existence for whatever reason may to him seem good.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CALIFORNIA ELEPHANT SEAL\r\nPhotographed on Guadalupe Island by C.H. Townsend.]\r\n\r\nTHE CALIFORNIA ELEPHANT SEAL, (_Mirounga angustirostris_).--This\r\nremarkable long-snouted species of seal was reluctantly stricken from\r\nthe fauna of the United States several years ago, and for at least\r\nfifteen years it has been regarded as totally extinct. Last year,\r\nhowever (1911), the _Albatross_ scientific expedition, under the control\r\nof Director C.H. Townsend of the New York Aquarium, visited Guadalupe\r\nIsland, 175 miles off the Pacific coast of Lower California and there\r\nfound about 150 living elephant seals. They took six living specimens,\r\nall of which died after a few months in captivity. Ever since that time,\r\nfirst one person and then another comes to the front with a cheerful\r\nproposition to go to those islands and \"clean up\" all the remainder of\r\nthose wonderful seals. One hunting party could land on Guadalupe, and in\r\none week totally destroy the last remnant of this almost extinct\r\nspecies. To-day the only question is, Who will be mean enough to do it?\r\n\r\nFortunately, those seals have no commercial value whatsoever. The little\r\noil they would yield would not pay the wages of cook's mate. The proven\r\nimpossibility of keeping specimens alive in captivity, even for one\r\nyear, and the absence of cash value in the skins, even for museum\r\npurposes, has left nothing of value in the animals to justify an\r\nexpedition to kill or to capture them. No zoological garden or park\r\ndesires any of them, at any price. Adult males attain a length of\r\nsixteen feet, and females eleven feet. Formerly this species was\r\nabundant in San Christobal Bay, Lower California.\r\n\r\nAt present, Mexico is in no frame of mind to provide real protection to\r\na small colony of seals of no commercial value, 175 miles from her\r\nmainland, on an uninhabited island. It is wildly improbable that those\r\nseals will be permitted to live. It is a safe prediction that our next\r\nnews of the elephant seals of Guadalupe will tell of the total\r\nextinction of those last 140 survivors of the species.\r\n\r\nTHE CALIFORNIA GRIZZLY BEAR, (_Ursus horribilis californicus_).--No one\r\nprotects grizzly bears, except in the Yellowstone Park and other game\r\npreserves. For obvious reasons, it is impossible to say whether any\r\nindividuals of this huge species now remain alive, or how long it will\r\nbe until the last one falls before a .405 Winchester engine of\r\nextermination. We know that a living specimen can not be procured with\r\nmoney, and we believe that \"Old Monarch\" now in Golden Gate Park, San\r\nFrancisco, is the last specimen of his species that ever will be\r\nexhibited alive.\r\n\r\nI can think of no reason, save general Californian apathy, why the\r\nextinction of this huge and remarkable animal was not prevented by law.\r\nThe sunset grizzly (on a railroad track) is the advertising emblem of\r\nthe Golden State, and surely the state should take sufficient interest\r\nin the species to prevent its total extermination.\r\n\r\nBut it will not. California is hell-bent on exterminating a long list of\r\nher wild-life species, and it is very doubtful whether the masses can be\r\nreached and aroused in time to stop it. Name some of the species?\r\nCertainly; with all the pleasure in life: The band-tailed pigeon, the\r\nwhite-tailed kite, the sharp-tailed grouse, the sage grouse, the\r\nmountain sheep, prong-horned antelope, California mule deer, and ducks\r\nand geese too numerous to mention.\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE EXTERMINATION OF SPECIES, STATE BY STATE\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly in 1912 I addressed to about 250 persons throughout the United\r\nStates, three questions, as follows:\r\n\r\n1. What species of birds have become totally extinct in your state?\r\n\r\n2. What species of birds and mammals are threatened with early\r\nextinction?\r\n\r\n3. What species of mammals have been exterminated throughout your state?\r\n\r\nThese queries were addressed to persons whose tastes and observations\r\nrendered them especially qualified to furnish the information desired.\r\nThe interest shown in the inquiry was highly gratifying. The best of the\r\ninformation given is summarized below; but this tabulation also includes\r\nmuch information acquired from other sources. The general summary of the\r\nsubject will, I am sure, convince all thoughtful persons that the\r\npresent condition of the best wild life of the nation is indeed very\r\ngrave. This list is not submitted as representing prolonged research or\r\nabsolute perfection, but it is sufficient to point forty-eight morals.\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nBIRDS AND MAMMALS THAT HAVE BEEN TOTALLY EXTERMINATED IN VARIOUS STATES\r\nAND PROVINCES\r\n\r\n\r\nALABAMA:\r\n\r\nPassenger pigeon, Carolina parrakeet; puma, elk, gray wolf, beaver.\r\n\r\nARIZONA:\r\n\r\nRidgway's quail (_Colinus ridgwayi_); Arizona elk (_Cervus merriami_),\r\nbison.\r\n\r\nARKANSAS:\r\n\r\nPassenger pigeon, Carolina parrakeet, whooping crane; bison, elk,\r\nbeaver.\r\n\r\nCALIFORNIA:\r\n\r\nNo birds totally extinct, but several nearly so; grizzly bear (?),\r\nelephant seal.\r\n\r\nCOLORADO:\r\n\r\nCarolina parrakeet, whooping crane; bison.\r\n\r\nCONNECTICUT:\r\n\r\nPassenger pigeon, Eskimo curlew, great auk, Labrador duck, upland\r\nplover, heath hen, wild turkey; puma, gray wolf, Canada lynx, black\r\nbear, elk.\r\n\r\nDELAWARE:\r\n\r\nWild turkey, ruffed grouse, passenger pigeon, heath hen, dickcissel,\r\nwhooping crane, Carolina parrakeet; white-tailed deer, black bear, gray\r\nwolf, beaver, Canada lynx, puma.\r\n\r\nFLORIDA:\r\n\r\nFlamingo, roseate spoonbill, scarlet ibis, Carolina parrakeet, passenger\r\npigeon.\r\n\r\nGEORGIA:\r\n\r\nPassenger pigeon, Carolina parrakeet, whooping crane, trumpeter swan;\r\nbison, elk, beaver, gray wolf, puma.--(Last 3, Craig D.

Experience has\r\ndemonstrated the fact that no one desires to inform voluntarily on his\r\nneighbors, and since breaking the game law is not construed to involve\r\nmoral turpitude, even to an infinitesimal degree, by many of our\r\ncitizens, the plunderers of nature's storehouse thus go free, it matters\r\nnot how great the damage done to the people as a whole.\"--(John H.\r\nWallace, Jr., Game Commissioner of Alabama.)\r\n\r\nALASKA:\r\n\r\nThanks to geographic and climatic conditions, the Alaskan game laws and\r\n$15,000 with which to enforce them, the status of the wild life of\r\nAlaska is fairly satisfactory. I think that at present no species is in\r\ndanger of extinction in the near future. When it was pointed out to\r\nCongress in 1902, by Madison Grant, T.S. Palmer and others that the wild\r\nlife of Alaska was seriously threatened, Congress immediately enacted\r\nthe law that was recommended, and now appropriates yearly a fair sum for\r\nits enforcement. I regard the Alaskan situation as being, for so vast\r\nand difficult a region, reasonably well in hand, even though open to\r\nimprovement.\r\n\r\nThere is one fatal defect in our Alaskan game law, in the perpetual and\r\nsweeping license to kill, that is bestowed upon \"natives\" and\r\n\"prospectors.\" Under cover of this law, the Indians can slaughter game\r\nto any extent they choose; and they are great killers. For example: In\r\n1911 at Sand Point, Kenai Peninsula, Frank E. Kleinchmidt saw 82 caribou\r\ntongues in the boat of a native, that had been brought in for sale at 50\r\ncents, while the carcasses were left where they fell, to poison the air\r\nof Alaska. Thanks to the game law, and five wardens, the number of big\r\ngame animals killed last year in Alaska by sportsmen was reasonably\r\nsmall,--just as it should have been.--(W.T.H.)\r\n\r\nARIZONA:\r\n\r\nDuring an overland trip made by Dr. MacDougal and others in 1907 from\r\nTucson to Sonoyta, on the international boundary, 150 miles and back\r\nagain, we saw not one antelope or deer.--(W.T.H.)\r\n\r\nCALIFORNIA:\r\n\r\nSwan, white heron, bronze ibis. California valley quail are getting very\r\nscarce, and unless adequate protection is afforded them shortly, they\r\nwill be found hereafter only in remote districts. Ducks also are\r\ndecreasing rapidly.--(H.W. Keller, Los Angeles.)\r\n\r\nSage grouse and Columbian sharp-tailed grouse are so nearly extinct that\r\nit may practically be said that they _are_ extinct. Among species likely\r\nto be exterminated in the near future are the wood-duck and band-tailed\r\npigeon.--(W.P. Taylor, Berkeley.)\r\n\r\nCOLORADO:\r\n\r\nSage grouse and sharp-tailed grouse; nearly all the shore birds.\r\n\r\nCONNECTICUT:\r\n\r\nAll the shore birds; quail, purple martin.\r\n\r\nDELAWARE:\r\n\r\nWood duck, upland plover, least tern, Wilson tern, roseate tern, black\r\nskimmer, oystercatcher, and numerous other littoral species. Pileated\r\nwoodpeckers, bald eagles and all the ducks are much more rare than\r\nformerly. Swan are about gone, geese scarce. The list of ducks, geese\r\nand shore-birds, as well as of terns and gulls that are nearing\r\nextinction is appalling.--(C.J. Pennock, Wilmington.)\r\n\r\nWood-duck, woodcock, turtle dove and bob-white.--(A.R. Spaid,\r\nWilmington.)\r\n\r\nFLORIDA:\r\n\r\nLimpkin, ivory-billed woodpecker, wild turkey (?).\r\n\r\nGEORGIA:\r\n\r\nRuffed grouse, wild turkey.\r\n\r\nIDAHO:\r\n\r\nHarlequin duck, mountain plover, dusky grouse, Columbian sharp-tailed\r\ngrouse, sage grouse. Elk, goats and grizzly bears are becoming very\r\nscarce. Of the smaller animals I have not seen a fisher for years, and\r\nmarten are hardly to be found. The same is true of other species.--(Dr.\r\nCharles S. Moody, Sand Point.)\r\n\r\nILLINOIS:\r\n\r\nPinnated grouse, except where rigidly protected. In Vermillion County,\r\nby long and persistent protection Harvey J. Sconce has bred back upon\r\nhis farm about 400 of these birds.\r\n\r\nINDIANA:\r\n\r\nPileated woodpecker, woodcock, ruffed grouse, pigeon hawk, duck\r\nhawk.--(Amos W. Butler, Indianapolis.)\r\n\r\nIn northern and northwestern Indiana, a perpetual close season and rigid\r\nprotection have enabled the almost-extinct pinnated grouse to breed up\r\nto a total number now estimated by Game Commissioner Miles and his\r\nwardens at 10,000 birds. This is a gratifying illustration of what can\r\nbe done in bringing back an almost-vanished species. The good example of\r\nIndiana should be followed by every state that still possesses a remnant\r\nof prairie-chickens, or other grouse.\r\n\r\nIOWA:\r\n\r\nPinnated grouse, wood-duck. Notwithstanding an invasion of Jasper\r\nCounty, Iowa, in the winter of 1911-12 by hundreds of pinnated grouse,\r\nsuch as had not been known in 20 years, this gives no ground to hope\r\nthat the future of the species is worth a moment's purchase. The winter\r\nmigration came from the Dakotas, and was believed to be due to the extra\r\nsevere winter, and the scarcity of food. Commenting on this\r\nunprecedented occurrence, J.L. Sloanaker in the \"Wilson Bulletin\" No.\r\n78, says:\r\n\r\n\"In the opinion of many, the formerly abundant prairie chicken is doomed\r\nto early extinction. Many will testify to their abundance in those years\r\n[in South Dakota, 1902] when the great land movement was taking place.\r\nThe influx of hungry settlers, together with an occasional bad season,\r\ndecimated their ranks. They were eaten by the farmers, both in and out\r\nof season. Driven from pillar to post, with no friends and insufficient\r\nfood,--what else then can be expected?\"\r\n\r\nMr. F.C. Pellett, of Atlantic, Iowa, says: \"Unless ways can be devised\r\nof rearing these birds in the domestic state, the prairie hen in my\r\nopinion is doomed to early extinction.\"\r\n\r\nThe older inhabitants here say that there is not one song-bird in summer\r\nwhere there used to be ten.--(G.H. Nicol, in _Outdoor Life_ March,\r\n1912.)\r\n\r\nKANSAS:\r\n\r\nTo all of those named in my previous list that are not actually extinct,\r\nI might add the prairie hen, the lesser prairie hen, as well as the\r\nprairie sharp-tailed grouse and the wood-duck. Such water birds as the\r\navocets, godwits, greater yellow-legs, long-billed curlew and Eskimo\r\ncurlew are becoming very rare. All the water birds that are killed as\r\ngame birds have been greatly reduced in numbers during the past 25\r\nyears. I have not seen a wood-duck in 5 years. _The prairie chicken_ has\r\nentirely disappeared from this locality. A few are still seen in the\r\nsand hills of western Kansas, and they are still comparatively abundant\r\nalong the extreme southwestern line, and in northern Oklahoma and the\r\nTexas panhandle.--(C.H. Smyth, Wichita.)\r\n\r\nYellow-legged plover, golden plover; Hudsonian and Eskimo curlew,\r\nprairie chicken.--(James Howard, Wichita.)\r\n\r\nLOUISIANA:\r\n\r\nIvory-billed woodpecker, butterball, bufflehead. The wood-duck is\r\ngreatly diminishing every year, and if not completely protected, ten\r\nyears hence no wood-duck will be found in Louisiana.--(Frank M. Miller,\r\nand G.E. Beyer, New Orleans.)\r\n\r\nIvory-billed woodpecker, sandhill crane, whooping crane, pinnated\r\ngrouse, American and snowy egret where unprotected.--(E.A. McIlhenny,\r\nAvery Island.)\r\n\r\nMAINE:\r\n\r\nWood-duck, upland plover, purple martin, house wren, pileated\r\nwoodpecker, bald eagle, yellow-legs, great blue heron, Canada goose,\r\nredhead and canvasback duck.--(John F. Sprague, Dover.)\r\n\r\nPuffin, Leach's petrel, eider duck, laughing gull, great blue heron,\r\nfish-hawk and bald eagle.--(Arthur H. Norton, Portland.)\r\n\r\nMARYLAND:\r\n\r\nCurlew, pileated woodpecker, summer duck, snowy heron. No record of\r\nsandhill crane for the last 35 years. Greater yellow-leg is much scarcer\r\nthan formerly, also Bartramian sandpiper. The only two birds which show\r\nan _increase_ in the past few years are the robin and lesser scaup.\r\nGeneral protection of the robin has caused its increase; stopping of\r\nspring shooting in the North has probably caused the increase of the\r\nlatter. As a general proposition I think I can say that all birds are\r\nbecoming scarcer in this state, as we have laws that do not protect,\r\nlittle enforcement of same, no revenue for bird protection and too\r\nlittle public interest. We are working to change all this, but it comes\r\nslowly. _The public fails to respond until the birds are 'most gone_,\r\nand we have a pretty good lot of game still left. The members of the\r\nOrder Gallinae are only holding their own where privately protected. The\r\nmembers of the Plover Family and what are known locally as shore birds\r\nare still plentiful on the shores of Chincoteague and Assateague, and\r\nalthough they do not breed there as formerly, so far as I know there are\r\nno species exterminated.--(Talbott Denmead, Baltimore.)\r\n\r\nMASSACHUSETTS:\r\n\r\nWood-duck, hooded merganser, blue-winged teal, upland plover; curlew\r\n(perhaps already gone); red-tailed hawk (I have not seen one in\r\nMiddlesex County for several years); great horned owl (almost gone in my\r\ncounty, Middlesex); house wren. The eave swallows and purple martins are\r\nfast deserting eastern Massachusetts and the barn swallows steadily\r\ndiminishing in numbers. The bald eagle should perhaps be included here.\r\nI seldom see or hear of it now.--(William Brewster, Cambridge.)\r\n\r\nUpland plover, woodcock, wood-duck (recent complete protection is\r\nhelping these somewhat), heath hen, piping plover, golden plover, a good\r\nmany song and insectivorous birds are apparently decreasing rather\r\nrapidly; for instance, the eave swallow.--(William P. Wharton, Groton.)\r\n\r\nMICHIGAN:\r\n\r\nWood-duck, limicolae, woodcock, sandhill crane. The great whooping crane\r\nis not a wild bird, but I think it is now practically extinct. Many of\r\nour warblers and song birds are now exceedingly rare. Ruffed grouse\r\ngreatly decreased during the past 10 years.--(W.B. Mershon, Saginaw.)\r\n\r\nMINNESOTA:\r\n\r\nThe sandhill crane has been killed by sportsmen. I have not seen one in\r\nthree years. Where there were, a few years ago, thousands of blue\r\nherons, egrets, wood ducks, redbirds, and Baltimore orioles, all those\r\nbirds are now almost extinct in this state. They are being killed by\r\nAustrians and Italians, who slaughter everything that flies or moves.\r\nRobins, too, will be a rarity if more severe penalties are not imposed.\r\nI have seized 22 robins, 1 pigeon hawk, 1 crested log-cock, 4\r\nwoodpeckers and 1 grosbeak in one camp, at the Lertonia mine, all being\r\nprepared for eating. I have also caught them preparing and eating sea\r\ngulls, terns, blue heron, egret and even the bittern. I have secured 128\r\nconvictions since the first of last September.--(George E. Wood, Game\r\nWarden, Hibbing, Minnesota.)\r\n\r\nFrom Robert Page Lincoln, Minneapolis.--Partridge are waning fast, quail\r\ngradually becoming extinct, prairie chickens almost extinct.\r\nDuck-shooting is rare. The gray squirrel is fast becoming extinct in\r\nMinnesota. Mink are going fast, and fur-bearing animals generally are\r\nbecoming extinct. The game is passing so very rapidly that it will soon\r\nbe a thing of the forgotten past. The quail are suffering most. The\r\nfalling off is amazing, and inconceivable to one who has not looked it\r\nup. Duck-shooting is rare, the clubs are idle for want of birds. What\r\nducks come down fly high, being harassed coming down from the north. I\r\nconsider the southern Minnesota country practically cleaned out.\r\n\r\nMISSOURI:\r\n\r\nThe birds threatened with extermination are the American woodcock,\r\nwood-duck, snowy egret, pinnated grouse, wild turkey, ruffed grouse,\r\ngolden eagle, bald eagle, pileated woodpecker.\r\n\r\nMONTANA:\r\n\r\nBlue grouse.--(Henry Avare, Helena.)\r\n\r\nSage grouse, prairie and Columbian sharp-tailed grouse, trumpeter swan,\r\nCanada goose, in fact, most of the water-fowl. The sickle-billed curlew,\r\nof which there were many a few years ago, is becoming scarce. There are\r\nno more golden or black-bellied plover in these parts.--(Harry P.\r\nStanford, Kalispell.)\r\n\r\nCurlew, Franklin grouse (fool hen) and sage grouse.--W.R. Felton, Miles\r\nCity.\r\n\r\nSage grouse.--(L.A. Huffman, Miles City.)\r\n\r\nPtarmigan, wood-duck, sharp-tailed grouse, sage grouse, fool hen and\r\nplover. All game birds are becoming scarce as the country becomes\r\nsettled and they are confined to uninhabited regions.--(Prof. M.J.\r\nElrod, Missoula.)\r\n\r\nNEBRASKA:\r\n\r\nGrouse, prairie chicken and quail.--(H.N. Miller, Lincoln.)\r\n\r\nWhistling swan.--(Dr. S.G. Towne, Omaha.)\r\n\r\nNEW HAMPSHIRE:\r\n\r\nWood-duck and upland plover.\r\n\r\nNEW YORK:\r\n\r\nQuail, woodcock, upland plover, golden plover, black-bellied plover,\r\nwillet, dowitcher, red-breasted sandpiper, long-billed curlew,\r\nwood-duck, purple martin, redheaded woodpecker, mourning dove; gray\r\nsquirrel, otter.\r\n\r\nNEW JERSEY:\r\n\r\nRuffed grouse, teal, canvasback, red-head duck, widgeon, and all species\r\nof shore birds, the most noticeable being black-bellied plover,\r\ndowitcher, golden plover, killdeer, sickle-bill curlew, upland plover\r\nand English snipe; also the mourning dove.--(James M. Stratton and\r\nErnest Napier, Trenton.)\r\n\r\nUpland plover, apparently killdeer, egret, wood-duck, woodcock, and\r\nprobably others.--(B.S. Bowdish, Demarest.)\r\n\r\nNORTH CAROLINA:\r\n\r\nForster's tern, oystercatcher, egret and snowy egret.--(T. Gilbert\r\nPearson, Sec. Nat. Asso. Audubon Societies.)\r\n\r\nRuffed grouse rapidly disappearing; bobwhite becoming scarce.--(E.L.\r\nEwbank, Hendersonville.)\r\n\r\nPerhaps American and snowy egret. If long-billed curlew is not extinct,\r\nit seems due to become so. No definite, reliable record of it later than\r\n1885.--(H.H. Brimley, Raleigh.)\r\n\r\nNORTH DAKOTA:\r\n\r\nWood-duck, prairie hen, upland plover, sharp-tailed grouse, canvas-back,\r\npinnated and ruffed grouse, double-crested cormorant, blue heron,\r\nlong-billed curlew, whooping crane and white pelican.--(W.B. Bell,\r\nAgricultural College.)\r\n\r\nUpland plover, marbled godwit, Baird's sparrow, chestnut-collared\r\nlongspur.--(Alfred Eastgate, Tolna.)\r\n\r\nOHIO:\r\n\r\nWhite heron, pileated woodpecker (if not already extinct). White heron\r\nreported a number of times last year; occurrences in Sandusky, Huron,\r\nAshtabula and several other counties during 1911. These birds would\r\ndoubtless rapidly recruit under a proper federal law.--(Paul North,\r\nCleveland.)\r\n\r\nTurtle dove, quail, red-bird, wren, hummingbird, wild canary [goldfinch]\r\nand blue bird.--(Walter C.

Hathaway, South Auburn.)\r\n\r\nSOUTH CAROLINA:\r\n\r\nWood duck, abundant 6 years ago, now almost gone. Wild turkey (abundant\r\nup to 1898); woodcock, upland plover, Hudsonian curlew, Carolina rail,\r\nVirginia rail, clapper rail and coot. Black bear verging on extinction,\r\nopossum dwindling rapidly.--(James H. Rice Jr., Summerville.)\r\n\r\nSOUTH DAKOTA:\r\n\r\nPrairie chicken and quail are most likely to become extinct in the near\r\nfuture.--(W.F. Bancroft, Watertown.)\r\n\r\nTEXAS:\r\n\r\nWild turkey and prairie chickens.--(J.D. Cox, Austin.)\r\n\r\nPlover, all species; curlew, cardinal, road-runner, woodcock, wood-duck,\r\ncanvas-back, cranes, all the herons; wild turkey; quail, all varieties;\r\nprairie chicken and Texas guan.--(Capt. M.B. Davis, Waco.)\r\n\r\nCurlew, very rare; plover, very rare; antelope. (Answer applies to the\r\nPanhandle of Texas.--Chas. Goodnight.)\r\n\r\nEverything [is threatened with extinction] save the dove, which is a\r\nmigrating bird. Antelope nearly all gone.--(Col. O.C. Guessaz, San\r\nAntonio.)\r\n\r\nUTAH:\r\n\r\nOur wild birds are well protected, and there are none that are\r\nthreatened with extinction. They are increasing.--(Fred. W. Chambers,\r\nState Game Warden, Salt Lake City.)\r\n\r\nVERMONT:\r\n\r\nIf all states afforded as good protection as does Vermont, none; but\r\nmigrating birds like woodcock are now threatened.--(John W. Tilcomb,\r\nState Game Warden, Lyndonville.)\r\n\r\nVIRGINIA:\r\n\r\nPheasants (ruffed grouse), wild turkey and other game birds are nearly\r\nextinct. A few bears remain, and deer in small numbers in remote\r\nsections. In fact, all animals show great reduction in numbers, owing to\r\ncutting down forests, and constant gunning.--(L.T. Christian, Richmond.)\r\n\r\nWEST VIRGINIA:\r\n\r\nWood-duck, wild turkey, northern raven, dickcissel.--(Rev. Earle A.\r\nBrooks, Weston.)\r\n\r\nWild turkeys are very scarce, also ducks. Doves, once numerous, now\r\nalmost _nil_. Eagles, except a few in remote fastnesses. Many native\r\nsong-birds are retreating before the English sparrow.--(William Perry\r\nBrown, Glenville.)\r\n\r\nWood-duck and wild turkey.--(J.A. Viquesney, Belington.)\r\n\r\nWISCONSIN:\r\n\r\nDouble-crested cormorant, upland plover, white pelican, long-billed\r\ncurlew, lesser snow goose, Hudsonian curlew, sandhill crane, golden\r\nplover, woodcock, dowitcher and long-billed duck; spruce grouse, knot,\r\nprairie sharp-tailed grouse, marbled godwit and bald eagle. All these,\r\nformerly abundant, must now be called rare in Wisconsin.--(Prof. George\r\nE. Wagner, Madison.)\r\n\r\nCommon tern, knot, American white pelican, Hudsonian godwit, trumpeter\r\nswan, long-billed curlew, snowy heron, Hudsonian curlew, American\r\navocet, prairie sharp-tailed grouse, dowitcher, passenger pigeon.\r\nLong-billed dowitcher and northern hairy woodpecker.--(Henry L. Ward,\r\nMilwaukee Public Museum.)\r\n\r\nWood-duck, ruddy duck, black mallard, grebe or hell-diver, tern and\r\nwoodcock.--(Fred. Gerhardt, Madison.)\r\n\r\nWYOMING:\r\n\r\nSage grouse and sharp-tailed grouse are becoming extinct, both in\r\nWyoming and North Dakota. Sheridan and Johnson Counties (Wyoming) have\r\nsage grouse protected until 1915. The miners (mostly foreigners) are out\r\nafter rabbits at all seasons. To them everything that flies, walks or\r\nswims, large enough to be seen, is a \"rabbit.\" They are even worse than\r\nthe average sheep-herder, as he will seldom kill a bird brooding her\r\nyoung, but to one of those men, a wren or creeper looks like a turkey.\r\nAntelope, mountain sheep and grizzly bears are _going_, fast! The moose\r\nseason opens in 1915, for a 30 days open season, then close season until\r\n1920.--(Howard Eaton, Wolf.)\r\n\r\nSage grouse, blue grouse, curlew, sandhill crane, porcupine practically\r\nextinct; wolverine and pine marten nearly all gone.--(S.N. Leek,\r\nJackson's Hole.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCANADA\r\n\r\n\r\nALBERTA:\r\n\r\nSwainson's buzzard and sandhill crane are now practically extinct. Elk\r\nand antelope will soon be as extinct as the buffalo.--(Arthur G.\r\nWooley-Dod, Calgary.)\r\n\r\nBRITISH COLUMBIA:\r\n\r\nWild fowl are in the greatest danger in the southern part of the\r\nProvince, especially the wood-duck. Otherwise birds are increasing\r\nrather than otherwise, especially the small non-game birds. The sea\r\notter is almost extinct.--(A. Bryan Williams, Provincial Game Warden,\r\nVancouver.)\r\n\r\nMANITOBA:\r\n\r\nWhooping crane, wood-duck and golden plover. Other species begin to show\r\na marked increase, due to our stringent protective measures. For\r\nexample, the pinnated grouse and sharp-tailed grouse are more plentiful\r\nthan in 15 years. Prong-horned antelope and wolf are threatened with\r\nextinction.--(J.P. Turner, Winnipeg.)\r\n\r\nThe game birds indigenous to this Province are fairly plentiful. Though\r\nthe prairie chicken was very scarce some few years ago, these birds have\r\nbecome very plentiful again, owing to the strict enforcement of our\r\npresent \"Game Act.\" The elk are in danger of becoming extinct if they\r\nare not stringently guarded. Beaver and otter were almost extinct some\r\nfew years ago, but are now on the increase, owing to a strict\r\nenforcement of the \"Game Act.\"--(Charles Barber, Winnipeg.)\r\n\r\nNEW BRUNSWICK:\r\n\r\nPartridge, plover and woodcock. Moose and deer are getting more\r\nplentiful every year.--(W.W. Gerard, St. John.)\r\n\r\nNOVA SCOTIA:\r\n\r\nThe Canada grouse may possibly become extinct in Nova Scotia, unless the\r\nprotection it now enjoys can save it. The American golden plover, which\r\nformerly came in immense flocks, is now very rare. Snowflakes are very\r\nmuch less common than formerly, but I think this is because our winters\r\nare now usually much less severe. The caribou is almost extinct on the\r\nmainland of Nova Scotia, but is still found in North Cape Breton Island.\r\nThe wolf has become excessively rare, but as it is found in New\r\nBrunswick, it may occur here at any time again. The beaver had been\r\nthreatened with extinction; but since being protected, it has\r\nmultiplied, and is now on a fairly safe footing again.--(Curator of\r\nMuseum, Halifax.)\r\n\r\nONTARIO:\r\n\r\nQuail are getting scarce.--(E. Tinsley, Toronto.)\r\n\r\nWood-duck, bob white, woodcock, golden plover, Hudsonian curlew, knot\r\nand dowitcher [are threatened with extinction.]--(C.W. Nash, Toronto.)\r\n\r\nPRINCE EDWARD ISLAND:\r\n\r\nThe species threatened with extinction are the golden plover, American\r\nwoodcock, pied-billed grebe, red-throated loon, sooty shearwater,\r\ngadwall, ruddy duck, black-crowned night heron, Hudsonian godwit,\r\nkildeer, northern pileated woodpecker, chimney swift, yellow-bellied\r\nflycatcher, red-winged blackbird, pine finch, magnolia warbler,\r\nruby-crowned kinglet.--(E.T. Carbonell, Charlottetown.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn closing the notes of this survey, I repeat my assurance that they are\r\nnot offered on a basis of infallibility. It would require years of work\r\nto obtain answers from forty-eight states to the three questions that I\r\nhave asked that could be offered as absolutely exact. All these reports\r\nare submitted on the well-recognized court-testimony basis,--\"to the\r\nbest of our knowledge and belief.\" Gathered as they have been from\r\npersons whose knowledge is good, these opinions are therefore valuable;\r\nand they furnish excellent indices of wild-life conditions as they exist\r\nin 1912 in the various states and provinces of North America north of\r\nMexico.\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE REGULAR ARMY OF DESTRUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to cure any disease, the surgeon must make of it a correct\r\ndiagnosis. It is useless to try to prescribe remedies without a thorough\r\nunderstanding of the trouble.\r\n\r\nThat the best and most interesting wild life of America is disappearing\r\nat a rapid rate, we all know only too well. That proposition is entirely\r\nbeyond the domain of argument. The fact that a species or a group of\r\nspecies has made a little gain here and there, or is stationary, does\r\nnot sensibly diminish the force of the descending blow. The wild-life\r\nsituation is full of surprises. For example, in 1902 I was astounded by\r\nthe extent to which bird life had decreased over the 130 miles between\r\nMiles City, Montana, and the Missouri River since 1886; for there was no\r\nreason to expect anything of the kind. Even the jack rabbits and coyotes\r\nhad almost totally disappeared.\r\n\r\nThe duties of the present hour, that fairly thrust themselves into our\r\nfaces and will not be put aside, are these:\r\n\r\n_First_,--To save valuable species from extermination!\r\n\r\n_Second_,--To preserve a satisfactory representation of our once rich\r\nfauna, to hand down to Posterity.\r\n\r\n_Third_,--To protect the farmer and fruit grower from the enormous\r\nlosses that the destruction of our insectivorous and rodent-eating birds\r\nis now inflicting upon both the producer and consumer.\r\n\r\n_Fourth_,--To protect our forests, by protecting the birds that keep\r\ndown the myriads of insects that are destructive to trees and shrubs.\r\n\r\n_Fifth_,--To preserve to the future sportsmen of America enough game and\r\nfish that they may have at least a taste of the legitimate pursuit of\r\ngame in the open that has made life so interesting to the sportsmen of\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\nFor any civilized nation to exterminate valuable and interesting species\r\nof wild mammals, birds or fishes is more than a disgrace. It is a crime!\r\nWe have no right, legal, moral or commercial, to exterminate any\r\nvaluable or interesting species; because none of them belong to us, to\r\nexterminate or not, as we please.\r\n\r\nFor the people of any civilized nation to permit the slaughter of the\r\nwild birds that protect its crops, its fruits and its forests from the\r\ninsect hordes, is worse than folly. It is sheer orneryness and idiocy.\r\nPeople who are either so lazy or asinine as to permit the slaughter of\r\ntheir best friends deserve to have their crops destroyed and their\r\nforests ravaged. They deserve to pay twenty cents a pound for their\r\ncotton when the boll weevil has cut down the normal supply.\r\n\r\nIt is very desirable that we should now take an inventory of the forces\r\nthat have been, and to-day are, active in the destruction of our wild\r\nbirds, mammals, and game fishes. During the past ten years a sufficient\r\nquantity of facts and figures has become available to enable us to\r\nsecure a reasonably full and accurate view of the whole situation. As we\r\npause on our hill-top, and survey the field of carnage, we find that we\r\nare reviewing the _Army of Destruction_!\r\n\r\nIt is indeed a motley array. We see true sportsmen beside ordinary\r\ngunners, game-hogs and meat hunters; handsome setter dogs are mixed up\r\nwith coyotes, cats, foxes and skunks; and well-gowned women and ladies'\r\nmaids are jostled by half-naked \"poor-white\" and black-negro \"plume\r\nhunters.\"\r\n\r\nVerily, the destruction of wild life makes strange companions.\r\n\r\nLet us briefly review the several army corps that together make up the\r\narmy of the destroyers. Space in this volume forbids an extended notice\r\nof each. Unfortunately it is impossible to segregate some of these\r\nclasses, and number each one, for they merge together too closely for\r\nthat; but we can at least describe the several classes that form the\r\ngreat mass of destroyers.\r\n\r\nTHE GENTLEMEN SPORTSMEN.--These men are the very bone and sinew of wild\r\nlife preservation. These are the men who have red blood in their veins,\r\nwho annually hear the red gods calling, who love the earth, the\r\nmountains, the woods, the waters and the sky. These are the men to whom\r\n\"the bag\" is a matter of small importance, and to whom \"the bag-limit\"\r\nhas only academic interest; because in nine cases out of ten they do not\r\ncare to kill all that the law allows. The tenth and exceptional time is\r\nwhen the bag limit is \"one.\" A gentleman sportsman is a man who protects\r\ngame, stops shooting when he has \"enough\"--without reference to the\r\nlegal bag-limit, and whenever a species is threatened with extinction,\r\nhe conscientiously refrains from shooting it.\r\n\r\nThe true sportsmen of the world are the men who once were keen in the\r\nstubble or on the trail, but who have been halted by the general\r\nslaughter and the awful decrease of game. Many of them, long before a\r\nhair has turned gray, have hung up their guns forever, and turned to the\r\ncamera. These are the men who are willing to hand out checks, or to\r\nleave their mirth and their employment and go to the firing line at\r\ntheir state capitols, to lock horns with the bull-headed killers of wild\r\nlife who recognize no check or limit save the law.\r\n\r\nThese are the men who have done the most to put upon our statute books\r\nthe laws that thus far have saved some of our American game from total\r\nannihilation, and who (so we firmly believe) will be chiefly\r\ninstrumental in tightening the lines of protection around the remnant.\r\nThese are the men who are making and stocking game preserves, public and\r\nprivate, great and small.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\nTHE REGULAR ARMY OF DESTRUCTION, WAITING FOR THE FIRST OF OCTOBER\r\nEach Year 2,642,274 Well-Armed Men Take the Field Against the Remnant\r\nof Wild Birds and Mammals In the United States.\r\nDrawn by Dan Beard]\r\n\r\nIf you wish to know some of these men, I will tell you where to find a\r\ngoodly number of them; and when you find them, you will also find that\r\nthey are men you would enjoy camping with! Look in the membership lists\r\nof the Boone and Crockett Club, Camp-Fire Club of America, the Lewis and\r\nClark Club of Pittsburgh, the New York State League, the Shikar Club of\r\nLondon, the Society for the Preservation of the Wild Fauna of the\r\nBritish Empire, the Massachusetts Fish and Game Protective Association,\r\nthe Springfield (Mass.) Sportsmen's Association, the Camp-Fire Clubs of\r\nDetroit and Chicago, and the North American Fish and Game Protective\r\nAssociation.\r\n\r\nThere are other bodies of sportsmen that I would like to name, were\r\nspace available, but to set down here a complete list is quite\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nThe best and the most of the game-protective laws now in force in the\r\nUnited States and Canada were brought into existence through the\r\ninitiative and efforts of the real sportsmen of those two nations. But\r\nfor their activity, exerted on the right side, the settled portion of\r\nNorth America would to-day be an utterly gameless land! Even though the\r\nsportsmen have taken their toll of the wilds, they have made the laws\r\nthat have saved a remnant of the game until 1912.\r\n\r\nFor all that, however, every man who still shoots game is a soldier in\r\nthe Army of Destruction! There is no blinking that fact. Such men do not\r\nstand on the summit with the men who now protect the game _and do not\r\nshoot at all!_ The millions of men who do not shoot, and who also _do\r\nnothing to protect or preserve wild life_, do not count! In this warfare\r\nthey are merely ciphers in front of the real figures.\r\n\r\nTHE GUNNERS, WHO KILL TO THE LIMIT.--Out of the enormous mass of men who\r\nannually take up arms against the remnant of wild life, _and are called\r\n\"sportsmen_,\" I believe that only one out of every 500 _conscientiously_\r\nstops shooting when game becomes scarce, and extinction is impending.\r\nAll of the others feel that it is right and proper to kill all the game\r\nthat they can kill _up to the legal bag limit_. It is the reasoning of\r\nShylock:\r\n\r\n\"Justice demands it, and _the law_ doth give it!\"\r\n\r\nEspecially is this true of the men who pay their _one dollar_ per year\r\nfor a resident hunting license, and feel that in doing so they have done\r\na great Big Thing!\r\n\r\nThis is a very deadly frame of mind. Ethically it is _entirely wrong_;\r\nand at least two million men and boys who shoot American game must be\r\nshown that it is wrong! This is the spirit of Extermination, clothed in\r\nthe robes of Law and Justice.\r\n\r\nWhenever and wherever game birds are so scarce that a good shot who\r\nhunts hard during a day in the fields finds only three or four birds, he\r\nshould _stop shooting at once, and devote his mind and energies to the\r\nproblem of bringing back the game!_ It is strange that conditions do not\r\nmake this duty clear to every conscientious citizen.\r\n\r\nThe Shylock spirit which prompts a man to kill all that \"the law allows\"\r\nis a terrible scourge to the wild life of America, and to the world at\r\nlarge. It is the spirit of extermination according to law. Even the\r\nkilling of game for the market is not so great a scourge as this; for\r\nthis spirit searches out the game in every nook and cranny of the world,\r\nand spares not. In effect it says: \"If the law is defective, it is right\r\nfor me to take every advantage of it! I do not need to have any\r\nconscience in the matter outside _the letter of the law_.\"\r\n\r\nThe extent to which this amazing spirit prevails is positively awful.\r\nYou will find it among pseudo game-protectors to a paralyzing extent! It\r\nis the great gunner's paradox, and it pervades this country from corner\r\nto corner. No: there is no use in trying to \"educate\" the mass of the\r\nhunters of America out of it, as a means of saving the game; for\r\npositively it can not be done! Do not waste time in trying it. If you\r\nrely upon it, you will be doing a great wrong to wild life, and\r\npromoting extermination. The only remedy is _sweeping laws, for long\r\nclose seasons, for a great many species_. Forget the paltry\r\ndollar-a-year license money. The license fees never represent more than\r\na tenth part of the value of the game that is killed under licenses.\r\n\r\nThe savage desire to kill \"all that the law allows\" often is manifested\r\nin men in whom we naturally expect to find a very different spirit. By\r\nway of illumination, I offer three cases out of the many that I could\r\nstate.\r\n\r\nCase No. 1. _The Duck Breeder_.--A gentleman of my acquaintance has\r\nspent several years and much money in breeding wild ducks. From my\r\nrelations with him, I had acquired the belief that he was a great lover\r\nof ducks, and at least wished all species well. One whizzing cold day in\r\nwinter he called upon me, and stated that he had been duck-hunting;\r\nwhich surprised me. He added, \"I have just spent two days on Great South\r\nBay, and I made a great killing. _In the two days I got ninety-four\r\nducks!\"_\r\n\r\nI said, \"How _could_ you do it,--caring for wild ducks as you do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I had hunted ducks twice before on Great South Bay and didn't\r\nhave very good luck; but this time the cold weather drove the ducks in,\r\nand I got square with them!\"\r\n\r\nCase No. 2. _The Ornithologist_.--A short time ago the news was\r\npublished in _Forest and Stream_, that a well-known ornithologist had\r\ndistinguished himself in one of the mid-western states by the skill he\r\nhad displayed in bagging thirty-four ducks in one day, greatly to the\r\nenvy of the natives; and if this shoe fits any American naturalist, he\r\nis welcome to put it on and wear it.\r\n\r\nCase No. 3. _The Sportsman_.--A friend of mine in the South is the owner\r\nof a game preserve in which wild ducks are at times very numerous. Once\r\nupon a time he was visited by a northern sportsmen who takes a deep and\r\nabiding interest in the preservation of game. The sportsman was invited\r\nto go out duck-shooting; ducks being then in season there. He said:\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I will go; and I want you to put me in a place where I can kill a\r\n_hundred ducks in a day_! I never have done that yet, and I would like\r\nto do it, once!\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" said my friend, \"I can put you in such a place; and if you\r\ncan shoot well enough, you can kill a hundred ducks in a day.\"\r\n\r\nThe effort was made in all earnestness. There was much shooting, but few\r\nwere the ducks that fell before it. In concluding this story my friend\r\nremarked in a tone of disgust:\r\n\r\n\"All the game-preserving sportsmen that come to me are just like that!\r\n_They want to kill all they can kill_!\"\r\n\r\nThere is a blood-test by which to separate the conscientious sportsmen\r\nfrom the mere gunners. Here it is:\r\n\r\nA _sportsman_ stops shooting when game becomes scarce; and he does not\r\nobject to long-close-season laws; but\r\n\r\nA _gunner_ believes in killing \"all that the law allows;\" and _he\r\nobjects to long close seasons_!\r\n\r\nI warrant that whenever and wherever this test is applied it will\r\nseparate the sheep from the goats. It applies in all America, all Asia\r\nand Africa, and in Greenland, with equal force.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: G.O. SHIELDS\r\nA Notable Defender of Wild Life]\r\n\r\nTHE GAME-HOG.--This term was coined by G.O. Shields, in 1897, when he\r\nwas editor and owner of _Recreation Magazine_, and it has come into\r\ngeneral use. It has been recognized by a judge on the bench as being an\r\nappropriate term to apply to all men who selfishly slaughter wild game\r\nbeyond the limits of decency. Although it is a harsh term, and was\r\nmercilessly used by Mr. Shields in his fierce war on the men who\r\nslaughtered game for \"sport,\" it has jarred at least a hundred thousand\r\nmen into their first realization of the fact that to-day there is a\r\ndifference between decency and indecency in the pursuit of game. The use\r\nof the term has done _very great good_; but, strange to say, it has made\r\nfor Mr. Shields a great many enemies _outside_ the ranks of the\r\ngame-hogs themselves! From this one might fairly suppose that there is\r\nsuch a thing as a sympathetic game-hog!\r\n\r\nOne thing at least is certain. During a period of about six years, while\r\nhis war with the game-hogs was on, from Maine to California, Mr.\r\nShields's name became a genuine terror to excessive killers of game; and\r\nit is reasonably certain that his war saved a great number of game birds\r\nfrom the slaughter that otherwise would have overtaken them!\r\n\r\nThe number of armed men and boys who annually take the field in the\r\nUnited States in the pursuit of birds and quadrupeds, is enormous.\r\nPeople who do not shoot have no conception of it; and neither do they\r\ncomprehend the mechanical perfection and fearful deadliness of the\r\nweapons used. This feature of the situation can hardly be realized until\r\nsome aspect of it is actually seen.\r\n\r\nI have been at some pains to collect the latest figures showing the\r\nnumber of hunting licenses issued in 1911, but the total is incomplete.\r\nIn some states the figures are not obtainable, and in some states there\r\nare no hunters' license laws. The figures of hunting licenses issued in\r\n1911 that I have obtained from official sources are set forth below.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE UNITED STATES ARMY OF DESTRUCTION\r\n\r\n_Hunting Licenses issued in_ 1911\r\n\r\nAlabama               5,090          Montana              59,291\r\nCalifornia          138,689          Nebraska             39,402\r\nColorado             41,058          New Hampshire        33,542\r\nConnecticut          19,635          New Jersey           61,920\r\nIdaho                50,342          New Mexico            7,000\r\nIllinois            192,244          New York            150,222\r\nIndiana              54,813          Rhode Island          6,541\r\nIowa                 91,000          South Dakota         31,054\r\nKansas               44,069          Utah                 27,800\r\nLouisiana            76,000          Vermont              31,762\r\nMaine                 2,552          Washington, about    40,000\r\nMassachusetts        45,039          Wisconsin           138,457\r\nMichigan             22,323          Wyoming               9,721\r\nMissouri             66,662\r\n                                                       ---------\r\n            Total number of regularly licensed gunners 1,486,228\r\n\r\nThe average for the twenty-seven states that issued licenses as shown\r\nabove is 55,046 for each state.\r\n\r\nNow, the twenty-one states issuing no licenses, or not reporting,\r\nproduced in 1911 fully as many gunners per capita as did the other\r\ntwenty-seven states. Computed fairly on existing averages they must have\r\nturned out a total of 1,155,966 gunners, making for all the United\r\nStates =2,642,194= armed men and boys warring upon the remnant of game\r\nin 1911. We are not counting the large number of lawless hunters who\r\nnever take out licenses. Now, is Mr. Beard's picture a truthful\r\npresentation, or not?\r\n\r\n_New York_ with only deer, ruffed grouse, shore-birds, ducks and a very\r\nfew woodcock to shoot annually puts into the field 150,222 armed men. In\r\n1909 they killed about _9,000 deer!_\r\n\r\n_New Jersey_, spending $30,000 in 1912 in efforts to restock her covers\r\nwith game, and with a population of 2,537,167, sent out in 1911 a total\r\narmy of 61,920 well-armed gunners. How can any of her game survive?\r\n\r\n_New Hampshire_, with only 430,572 population, has 33,542 licensed\r\nhunters,--equal to _thirty-three regiments of full strength!_\r\n\r\n_Vermont_, with 355,956 people, sends out annually an army of 31,762 men\r\nwho hunt according to law; and in 1910 they killed 3,649 deer.\r\n\r\n_Utah_, with only 373,351 population, had 27,800 men in the field after\r\nher very small remnant of game! How can any wild thing of Utah escape?\r\n\r\n_Montana_, population 376,053, had in 1911 an army of 59,291 well-armed\r\nmen, warring chiefly upon the big game, and swiftly exterminating it.\r\n\r\nHow long can any of the big game stand before the army of _two and\r\none-half million well-armed men_, eager and keen to kill, and out to get\r\nan equivalent for their annual expenditure in guns, ammunition and other\r\nexpenses?\r\n\r\nIn addition to the hunters themselves, they are assisted by thousands of\r\nexpert guides, thousands of horses, thousands of dogs, hundreds of\r\nautomobiles and hundreds of thousands of tents. Each big-game hunter has\r\nan experienced guide who knows the haunts and habits of the game, the\r\nbest feeding grounds, the best trails, and everything else that will aid\r\nthe hunter in taking the game at a disadvantage and destroying it. The\r\nbig-game rifles are of the highest power, the longest range, the\r\ngreatest accuracy and the best repeating mechanism that modern inventive\r\ngenius can produce. It is said that in Wyoming the Maxim silencer is now\r\nbeing used. England has produced a weapon of a new type, called \"the\r\nscatter rifle,\" which is intended for use on ducks. The best binoculars\r\nare used in searching out the game, and horses carry the hunters and\r\nguides as near as possible to the game. For bears, baits are freely\r\nused, and in the pursuit of pumas, dogs are employed to the limit of the\r\navailable supply.\r\n\r\nThe deadliness of the automobile in hunting already is so apparent that\r\nNorth Dakota has wisely and justly forbidden their use by law, (1911).\r\nThe swift machine enables city gunmen to penetrate game regions they\r\ncould not reach with horses, and hunt through from four to six\r\nlocalities per day, instead of one only, as formerly. The use of\r\nautomobiles in hunting should be everywhere prohibited.\r\n\r\nEvery appliance and assistance that money can buy, the modern sportsman\r\nsecures to help him against the game. The game is beset during its\r\nbreeding season by various wild enemies,--foxes, cats, wolves, pumas,\r\nlynxes, eagles, and many other predatory species. The only help that it\r\nreceives is in the form of an annual close season--_which thus far has\r\nsaved in America only a few local moose, white-tailed deer and a few\r\ngame birds, from steady and sure extermination_.\r\n\r\n_The bag limits on which vast reliance is placed to preserve the wild\r\ngame, are a fraud, a delusion and a snare_! The few local exceptions\r\nonly prove the generality of the rule. In every state, without one\r\nsingle exception, the bag limits are far too high, and the laws are of\r\ndeadly liberality. In many states, the bag limit laws on birds are an\r\nabsolute dead letter. Fancy the 125 wardens of New York enforcing the\r\nbag-limit laws on 150,000 gunners! It is this horrible condition that is\r\nenabling the licensed army of destruction to get in its deadly work on\r\nthe game, all over the world. In America, the over-liberality of the\r\nlaws are to blame for two-thirds of the carnival of slaughter, and the\r\nsuccessful evasions of the law are responsible for the other third.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TWO GUNNERS OF KANSAS CITY\r\nWho Believe in Killing all That the Law Allows. They are not so Much to\r\nBlame as the System That Permits Such Slaughter. (Note the Pump Guns)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHY THE SANDHILL CRANE IS BECOMING EXTINCT\r\nNineteen of Them Killed as \"Game\" by Three Gunners. Note the Machine Gun.]\r\n\r\nThe only remedy for the present extermination of game according to law\r\nthat so rapidly and so furiously is proceeding all over the United\r\nStates, Canada, Alaska, and Africa, is ten-year close seasons on all the\r\nspecies threatened with extinction, and immensely reduced open seasons\r\nand bag limits on all the others.\r\n\r\nWill the people who still have wild game take heed now, and clamp down\r\nthe brakes, hard and fast before it is too late, or will they have their\r\ngame exterminated?\r\n\r\nShall we have five-year close seasons, or close seasons of 500 years? We\r\nmust take our choice.\r\n\r\nShall we hand down to our children a gameless continent, with all the\r\nshame that such a calamity will entail?\r\n\r\nWe have _got_ to answer these questions like men, or they will soon be\r\nanswered for us by the extermination of the wild life. For twenty-five\r\nyears we have been smarting under the disgrace of the extermination of\r\nour bison millions. Let us not repeat the dose through the destruction\r\nof other species.\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE GUERRILLAS OF DESTRUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have now to deal with THE GUERRILLAS OF DESTRUCTION.\r\n\r\nIn warfare, a _guerrilla, or bushwhacker_, is an armed man who\r\nrecognizes none of the rules of civilized warfare, and very often has no\r\ncommander. In France he is called a \"franc-tireur,\" or free-shooter. The\r\nguerrilla goes out to live on the country, to skulk, to war on the weak,\r\nand never attack save from ambush, or when the odds clearly are on his\r\nside. His military status is barely one remove from that of the spy.\r\n\r\nThe meat-shooters who harry the game and other wild life in order to use\r\nit as a staple food supply; the Italians, negroes and others who shoot\r\nsong-birds as food; the plume-hunters and the hide-and-tusk hunters all\r\nover the world are the guerrillas of the Army of Destruction. Let us\r\nconsider some of these grand divisions in detail.\r\n\r\nHere is an inexorable law of Nature, to which there are no exceptions:\r\n\r\n_No wild species of bird, mammal, reptile or fish can withstand\r\nexploitation for commercial purposes_.\r\n\r\nThe men who pursue wild creatures for the money or other value there is\r\nin them, never give up. They work at slaughter when other men are\r\nenjoying life, or are asleep. If they are persistent, no species on\r\nwhich they fix the Evil Eye escapes extermination at their hands.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone question this statement? If so let him turn backward and\r\nlook at the lists of dead and dying species.\r\n\r\nTHE DIVISION OF MEAT-SHOOTERS contains all men who sordidly shoot for\r\nthe frying-pan,--to save bacon and beef at the expense of the public, or\r\nfor the markets. There are a few wilderness regions so remote and so\r\ndifficult of access that the transportation of meat into them is a\r\nmatter of much difficulty and expense. There are a very few men in North\r\nAmerica who are justified in \"living off the country,\" _for short\r\nperiods_. The genuine prospectors always have been counted in this\r\nclass; but all miners who are fully located, all lumbermen and\r\nrailway-builders certainly are not in the prospector's class. They are\r\nabundantly able to maintain continuous lines of communication for the\r\ntransit of beef and mutton.\r\n\r\nOf all the meat-shooters, the market-gunners who prey on wild fowl and\r\nground game birds for the big-city markets are the most deadly to wild\r\nlife. Enough geese, ducks, brant, quail, ruffed grouse, prairie\r\nchickens, heath hens and wild pigeons have been butchered by gunners and\r\nnetters for \"the market\" to have stocked the whole world. No section\r\ncontaining a good supply of game has escaped. In the United States the\r\ngreat slaughtering-grounds have been Cape Cod; Great South Bay, New\r\nYork; Currituck Sound, North Carolina; Marsh Island, Louisiana; the\r\nsouthwest corner of Louisiana; the Sunk Lands of Arkansas; the lake\r\nregions of Minnesota; the prairies of the whole middle West; Great Salt\r\nLake; the Klamath Lake region (Oregon) and southern California.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A MARKET GUNNER AT WORK ON MARSH ISLAND\r\nKilling Mallards for the New Orleans Market. The Purchase of This Island by\r\nMrs. Russell Sage has now Converted it Into a Bird Sanctuary]\r\n\r\nThe output of this systematic bird slaughter has supplied the greedy\r\ngame markets of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Washington, Baltimore,\r\nChicago, New Orleans, St. Louis, Salt Lake City, San Francisco,\r\nPortland, and Seattle. The history of this industry, its methods, its\r\ncarnage, its profits and its losses would make a volume, but we can not\r\nenter upon it here. Beyond reasonable doubt, this awful traffic in dead\r\ngame is responsible for at least three-fourths of the slaughter that has\r\nreduced our game birds to a mere remnant of their former abundance.\r\nThere is no influence so deadly to wild life as that of the market\r\ngunner who works six days a week, from sunrise until sunset, hunting\r\ndown and killing every game bird that he can reach with a choke-bore\r\ngun.\r\n\r\nDuring the past five years, several of the once-great killing grounds\r\nhave been so thoroughly \"shot out\" that they have ceased to hold their\r\nformer rank. This is the case with the Minnesota Lakes, the Sunk Lands\r\nof Arkansas, the Klamath Lakes of Oregon, and I think it is also true of\r\nsouthern California. The Klamath Lakes have been taken over by the\r\nGovernment as a bird refuge. Currituck Sound, at the northeastern corner\r\nof North Carolina, has been so bottled up by the Bayne law of New York\r\nState that Currituck's greatest market has been cut off. Last year only\r\none-half the usual number of ducks and geese were killed; and already\r\nmany \"professional\" duck and brant shooters have abandoned the business\r\nbecause the commission merchants no longer will buy dead birds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RUFFED GROUSE\r\nA Common Victim of Illegal Slaughter]\r\n\r\nVery many enormous bags of game have been made in a day by market\r\ngunners: but rarely have they published any of their records. The\r\ngreatest kill of which I ever have heard occurred under the auspices of\r\nthe Glenn County Club, in southern California, on February 5, 1906. Two\r\nmen, armed with automatic shot-guns, fired five shots apiece, and got\r\nten geese out of one flock. In one hour they killed _two hundred and\r\neighteen geese_, and their bag for the day was _four hundred and fifty\r\ngeese!_ The shooter who wrote the story for publication (on February 12,\r\nat Willows, Glenn County, California) said: \"It being warm weather, the\r\nbirds had to be shipped at once in order to keep them from spoiling.\" A\r\nphotograph was made of the \"one hour's slaughter\" of two hundred and\r\neighteen geese, and it was published in a western magazine with\r\n\"C.H.B.'s\" story, nearly all of which will be found in Chapter XV.\r\n\r\nThe reasons why market shooting is so deadly destructive to wild life\r\nare not obscure.\r\n\r\nThe true sportsman hunts during a very few days only each year. The\r\nmarket gunners shoot early and late, six days a week, month after month.\r\nWhen game is abundant, the price is low, and a great quantity must be\r\nkilled in order to make it pay well. When game is scarce, the market\r\nprices are high, and the shooter makes the utmost exertions to find the\r\nlast of the game in order to secure the \"big money.\"\r\n\r\nWhen game is protected by law, thousands of people with money desire it\r\nfor their tables, just the same, and are willing to pay fabulous prices\r\nfor what they want, when they want it. Many a dealer is quite willing to\r\nrun the risk of fines, because fines don't really hurt; they are only\r\nannoying. The dealer wishes to make the big profit, and _retain his\r\ncustomers_; \"and besides,\" he reasons, \"if I don't supply him some one\r\nelse will; so what is the difference?\"\r\n\r\nWhen game is scarce, prices high and the consumer's money ready, there\r\nare a hundred tricks to which shooters and dealers willingly resort to\r\nship and receive unlawful game without detection. It takes the very\r\nbest kind of game wardens,--genuine detectives, in fact,--to ferret out\r\nthese cunning illegal practices, and catch lawbreakers \"with the goods\r\non them,\" so that they can be punished. Mind you, convictions can not be\r\nsecured at _both_ ends of the line save by the most extraordinary good\r\nfortune, and usually the shooter and shipper escape, even when the\r\ndealer is apprehended and fined.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A PERFECTLY LAWFUL BAG OF 58 RUFFED GROUSE FOR TWO MEN\r\nFrom \"Rod and Gun in Canada\"]\r\n\r\nHere are some of the methods that have been practiced in the past in\r\ngetting illegal game into the New York market:\r\n\r\nRuffed grouse and quail have both been shipped in butter firkins, marked\r\n\"butter\"; and latterly, butter has actually been packed solidly on top\r\nof the birds.\r\n\r\nRuffed grouse and quail very often have been shipped in egg crates,\r\nmarked \"eggs.\" They have been shipped in trunks and suit cases,--a very\r\ncommon method for illegal game birds, all over the United States. In\r\nOklahoma when a man refuses to open his trunk for a game warden, the\r\nwarden joyously gets out his brace and bitt, and bores an inch hole into\r\nthe lower story of the trunk. If dead birds are there, the tell-tale\r\nauger quickly reveals them.\r\n\r\nThree years ago, I was told that certain milk-wagons on Long Island made\r\ndaily collections of dead ducks intended for the New York market, and\r\nthe drivers kindly shipped them by express from the end of the route.\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time, a New York man gave notice that on a certain date he\r\nwould be in a certain town in St. Lawrence County, New York, with a\r\npalace horse-car, \"to buy horses.\" Car and man appeared there as\r\nadvertised. Very ostentatiously, he bought one horse, and had it taken\r\naboard the car before the gaze of the admiring populace. At night, when\r\nthe A.P. had gone to bed, many men appeared, and into the horseless end\r\nof that car, they loaded thousands of ruffed grouse. The game warden who\r\ndescribed the incident to me said: \"That man pulled out for New York\r\nwith one horse and _half a car load of ruffed grouse_!\"\r\n\r\nWhenever a good market exists for the sale of game, as sure as the world\r\nthat market will be supplied. Twenty-six states forbid by law the sale\r\nof _their own_ \"protected\" game, but twenty of them do _not_ expressly\r\nprohibit the sale of game stolen from neighboring states! That is _a\r\nvery, very weak point in the laws of all those states_. A child can see\r\nhow it works. Take Pittsburgh as a case in point.\r\n\r\nIn the winter and spring of 1912 the State Game Commission of\r\nPennsylvania found that quail and ruffed grouse were being sold in\r\nPittsburgh, in large quantities. The state laws were well enforced, and\r\nit was believed that the birds were not being killed in Pennsylvania.\r\nSome other state was being _robbed_!\r\n\r\nThe Game Commission went to work, and in a very short time certain\r\ngame-dealers of Pittsburgh were arrested. At first they tried to bluff\r\ntheir way out of their difficulty, and even went as far as to bring\r\ncharges against the game-warden whom the Commission had instructed to\r\nbuy some of their illegal game, and pay for it. But the net of the law\r\ntightened upon them so quickly and so tightly that they threw up their\r\nhands and begged for mercy.\r\n\r\nIt was found that those Pittsburgh game-dealers were selling quail and\r\ngrouse that had been stolen in thousands, from the state of Kentucky!\r\nBetween the state game laws, working in lovely harmony with the Lacey\r\nfederal law that prohibits the shipment of game illegally killed or\r\nsold, the whole bad business was laid bare, and signed confessions were\r\npromptly obtained from the shippers in Kentucky.\r\n\r\nAt that very time, a good bill for the better protection of her game was\r\nbefore the Kentucky legislature; and a certain member was vigorously\r\nopposing it, as he had successfully done in previous years. He was told\r\nthat the state was being robbed, but refused to believe it. Then a\r\nsigned confession was laid before him, bearing the name of the man who\r\nwas instigating his opposition,--his friend,--who confessed that he had\r\nillegally bought and shipped to Pittsburgh over 5,000 birds. The\r\nobjector literally threw up his hands, and said, \"I have been _wrong!_\r\nLet the bill go through!\" And it went.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SNOW BUNTING\r\nA Great \"Game Bird\"! Of These, 8,058 Were Found in 1902\r\nin one New York Cold-Storage Warehouse]\r\n\r\nBefore the passage of the Bayne law, New York City was a \"fence\" for the\r\nsale of grouse illegally killed in Massachusetts, Connecticut,\r\nPennsylvania, New Jersey and I know not how many other states. The Bayne\r\nlaw stopped all that business, abruptly and forever; and if the ruffed\r\ngrouse, quail and ducks of the Eastern States are offered for sale in\r\nChicago, Cincinnati, Baltimore and Washington, the people of New York\r\nand Massachusetts can at least be assured that they are not to blame.\r\nThose two states now maintain no \"fences\" for the sale of game that has\r\nbeen stolen from other states. They have both set their houses in order,\r\nand set two examples for forty other states to follow.\r\n\r\nThe remedy for all this miserable game-stealing, law-breaking business\r\nis simple and easily obtained. Let each state of the United States and\r\neach province and Canada _enact a Bayne law, absolutely prohibiting the\r\nsale of all wild native game_, and the thing is done! But nothing short\r\nof that will be really effective. It will not do at all to let state\r\nlaws rest with merely forbidding the sale of game \"protected by the\r\nState;\" for that law is full of loop-holes. It does much good service,\r\nyes; but what earthly _objection_ can there be in any state to the\r\nenactment of a law that is sweepingly effective, and which can not be\r\nevaded, save through the criminal connivance of officers of the law?\r\n\r\nBy way of illustration, to show what the sale of wild game means to the\r\nremnant of our game, and the wicked slaughter of non-game birds to which\r\nit leads, consider these figures:\r\n\r\nDEAD BIRDS FOUND IN ONE COLD STORAGE HOUSE IN NEW YORK IN 1902.\r\n\r\nSnow Buntings   8,058\r\nGrouse          7,560\r\nSandpipers      7,607\r\nQuail           4,385\r\nPlover          5,218\r\nDucks           1,756\r\nSnipe           7,003\r\nBobolinks         288\r\nYellow-legs       788\r\nWoodcock           96\r\n\r\nThe fines for this lot, if imposed, would have amounted to $1,168,315.\r\n\r\nShortly after that seizure American quail became so scarce that in\r\neffect they totally disappeared from the banquet tables of New York. I\r\ncan not recall having been served with one since 1903, but the little\r\nEgyptian quail can be legally imported and sold when officially tagged.\r\n\r\nFew persons away from the firing line realize the far-reaching effects\r\nof the sale of wild game. Here are a few flashes from the searchlight:\r\n\r\nAt Hangkow, China, Mr. C. William Beebe found that during his visit in\r\n=1911=, over =46,000= pheasants of various species were shipped from\r\nthat port on one cold-storage steamer to the London market. And this\r\nwhen English pheasants were selling in the Covent Garden market at from\r\ntwo to three shillings each, for _fresh_ birds!\r\n\r\nIn =1910=, =1,200= ptarmigan from Norway, bound for the Chicago market,\r\npassed through the port of New York,--not by any means the first or the\r\nlast shipment of the kind. The epicures of Chicago are being permitted\r\nto comb the game out of Norway.\r\n\r\nIn =1910=, =70,000= _dozen_ Egyptian quail were shipped to Europe from\r\nAlexandria, Egypt. Just why that species has not already been\r\nexterminated, is a zoological mystery; but extermination surely will\r\ncome some day, and I think it will be in the near future.\r\n\r\nThe coast of China has been raked and scraped for wild ducks to ship to\r\nNew York,--prior to the passage of the Bayne law! I have forgotten the\r\nfigures that once were given me, but they were an astonishing number of\r\nthousands for the year.\r\n\r\nThe Division of Negroes and Poor Whites who kill song and other birds\r\nindiscriminately will be found in a separate chapter.\r\n\r\nTHE DIVISION OF \"RESIDENT\" GAME-BUTCHERS.--This refers to the men who\r\nlive in the haunts of big game, where wardens are the most of the time\r\ntotally absent, and where bucks, does and fawns of hoofed big game may\r\nbe killed in season and out of season, with impunity. It includes\r\nguides, ranchmen, sheep-herders, cowboys, miners, lumbermen and floaters\r\ngenerally. In times past, certain taxidermists of Montana promoted the\r\nslaughter of wild bison in the Yellowstone Park, and it was a pair of\r\nrascally taxidermists who killed, or caused to be killed in Lost Park,\r\nin 1897, the very last bison of Colorado.\r\n\r\nIt seems to be natural for the minds of men who live in America in the\r\nhaunts of big game to drift into the idea that the wild game around them\r\nis all theirs. Very few of them recognize the fact that every other man,\r\nwoman and child in a given state or province has vested rights in its\r\nwild game. It is natural for a frontiersman to feel that because he is\r\nin the wilds he has a God-given right to live off the country; but\r\nto-day _that idea is totally wrong_! If some way can not be found to\r\ncurb that all-pervading propensity among our frontiersmen, then we may\r\nas well bid all our open-field big game a long farewell; for the deadly\r\n\"residents\" surely will exterminate it, outside the game preserves. The\r\n\"residents\" are, in my opinion, about ten times more destructive than\r\nthe sportsmen. A sportsman in quest of large game is in the field only\r\nfrom ten to thirty days; all his movements are known, and all his\r\ntrophies are seen and counted. His killing is limited by law, and upon\r\nhim the law is actually enforced. Often a resident hunts the whole\r\ntwelve months of the year,--for food, for amusement, and for trophies to\r\nsell. Rarely does a game warden reach his cabin; because the wardens are\r\nfew, the distances great and the frontier cabins are widely scattered.\r\n\r\nMr. Carl Pickhardt told me of a guide in Newfoundland who had a shed in\r\nthe woods hanging full of bodies of caribou, and who admitted to him\r\nthat while the law allowed him five caribou each year, he killed each\r\nyear about twenty-five.\r\n\r\nMr. J.M. Phillips knows of a mountain in British Columbia, once well\r\nstocked with goats, on which the goats have been completely exterminated\r\nby one man who lives within easy striking distance of them, and who\r\nfinds goat meat to his liking.\r\n\r\nI have been reliably informed that in 1911, at Haha Lake, near Grande\r\nBay, Saguenay District, P.Q., one family of six persons killed\r\nthirty-four woodland caribou and six moose. This meant the waste of\r\nabout 14,000 pounds of good meat, and the death of several female\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nIn 1886 I knew a man named Owens who lived on the head of Sunday Creek,\r\nMontana, who told me that in 1884-5 he killed thirty-five mule deer for\r\nhimself and family. The family ate as much as possible, the dogs ate all\r\nthey could, and in the spring the remainder spoiled. Now there is not a\r\ndeer, an antelope, or a sage grouse within fifty miles of that lifeless\r\nwaste.\r\n\r\nHere is a Montana object lesson on the frame of mind of the \"resident\"\r\nhunter, copied from _Outdoor Life_ Magazine (Denver) for February, 1912.\r\nIt is from a letter to the Editor, written by C.B. Davis.\r\n\r\n  November 27, 28, 29, and 30, 1911, will remain a red letter day with\r\n  a half thousand men for years to come. These half thousand men\r\n  gathered along the border of the Yellowstone National Park, near\r\n  Gardiner, Montana, at a point known as Buffalo Flats, to exterminate\r\n  elk. The snow had driven the elk down to the foothills, and Buffalo\r\n  Flats is on the border of the park and outside the park. The elk\r\n  entered this little valley for food. Like hungry wolves, shooters,\r\n  not hunters, gathered along the border waiting to catch an elk off\r\n  the \"reservation\" and kill it.\r\n\r\n  On November 27th about 1500 elk crossed the line, and the slaughter\r\n  began. I have not the data of the number killed this day, but it was\r\n  hundreds.\r\n\r\n  On the 28th, twenty-two stepped over and were promptly executed.\r\n  Like Custer's band, not one escaped. On the evening of the 28th, 600\r\n  were sighted just over the line, and the army of 125 brave men\r\n  entrenched themselves for the battle which was expected to open next\r\n  morning. Before daylight of the 29th the battle began. The elk were\r\n  over the line, feeding on Buffalo Flats. One hundred and twenty-five\r\n  men poured bullets into this band of 600 elk till the ground was red\r\n  with blood and strewn with carcasses, and in their madness they shot\r\n  each other. One man was shot through the ear,--a close call; another\r\n  received a bullet through his coat sleeve, and another was shot\r\n  through the bowels and can't live.\r\n\r\n  My informer told me he participated in the slaughter, and while he\r\n  would not take fifty dollars for what he saw, and the experience he\r\n  went through, yet he would not go through it again for $1,000. When\r\n  my informer got back to Gardiner that day there were four sleigh\r\n  loads of elk, each load containing from twenty to thirty-five elk,\r\n  besides thirty-two mules and horses carrying one to two each. This\r\n  was only a part of the slaughter. Hundreds more were carried to\r\n  other points; and this was only one day's work.\r\n\r\n  Hundreds of wounded elk wandered back into the park to die, and\r\n  others died outside the park. The station at Livingston, Montana,\r\n  for a week looked like a packing house. Carcasses were piled up on\r\n  the trucks and depot platform. The baggage cars were loaded with elk\r\n  going to points east and west of Livingston.\r\n\r\n  Maybe this is all right. Maybe the government can't stop the elk\r\n  from crossing the line. Maybe the elk were helped over; but it\r\n  strikes me there is something wrong somewhere.\r\n\r\nTHE DIVISION OF HIRED LABORERS.--The scourge of lumber-camps in big-game\r\nterritory, the mining camps and the railroad-builders is a long story,\r\nand if told in detail it would make several chapters. Their awful\r\ndestructiveness is well known. It is a common thing for \"the boss\" to\r\nhire a hunter to kill big game to supply the hungry outfit, and save\r\nbeef and pork.\r\n\r\nThe abuses arising from this source easily could be checked, and finally\r\nsuppressed. A ten-line law would do the business,--forbidding any person\r\nemployed in any camp of sheep men, cattle men, lumbermen, miners,\r\nrailway laborers or excavators to own or use a rifle in hunting wild\r\ngame; and forbidding any employer of labor to feed those laborers, or\r\npermit them to be fed, on the flesh of wild game mammals or birds.\r\n\"Camp\" laborers are not \"pioneers;\" not by a long shot! They are\r\nsoldiers of Commerce, and makers of money.\r\n\r\nA MOUNTAIN SHEEP CASE IN COLORADO.--The state of Colorado sincerely\r\ndesires to protect and perpetuate its slender remnant of mountain sheep,\r\nbut as usual the Lawless Miscreant is abroad to thwart the efforts of\r\nthe guardians of the game. Every state that strives to protect its big\r\ngame has such doings as this to contend with:\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1911-12, a resident poacher brought into Grant,\r\nColorado, a lot of mountain sheep meat _for sale_; and he actually sold\r\nit to residents of that town! The price was _six cents per pound_. A lot\r\nof it was purchased by the railway station-agent. I have no doubt that\r\nthe same man who did that job, which was made possible only by the\r\nco-operation of the citizens of Grant, will try the same\r\npoaching-and-selling game next winter, unless the State Game\r\nCommissioner is able to bring him to book.\r\n\r\nA WYOMING CASE IN POINT.--As a fair sample of what game wardens, and the\r\ngeneral public, are sometimes compelled to endure through the improper\r\ndecisions of judges, I will cite this case:\r\n\r\nIn the Shoshone Mountains of northern Wyoming, about fifty miles or so\r\nfrom the town of Cody, in the winter of 1911-12 a man was engaged in\r\ntrapping coyotes. It was currently reported that he had been \"driven out\r\nof Montana and Idaho.\" He had scores of traps. He baited his traps with\r\nthe flesh of deer, elk calves and grouse, all illegally killed and\r\nillegally used for that purpose. A man of my acquaintance saw some of\r\nthis game meat actually used as described.\r\n\r\nThe man was a notorious character, and cruel in the extreme. Finally a\r\ngame warden caught him red-handed, arrested him, and took him to Cody\r\nfor trial. It happened that the judge on the bench had once trapped with\r\nhim, and therefore \"he set the game-killer free, while the game-warden\r\nwas roasted.\"\r\n\r\nThat wolf-trapper once took into the mountains a horse, to kill and use\r\nas bear-bait. The animal was blind in one eye, and because it would not\r\ngraze precisely where the wolfer desired it to remain, he deliberately\r\ndestroyed the sight of its good eye, and left it for days, without the\r\nability to find water.\r\n\r\nThink of the fate of any wild animal that unkind Fate places at the\r\nmercy of such a man!\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nUNSEEN FOES OF WILD LIFE\r\n\r\n\r\nQuite unintentionally on his part, Man, the arch destroyer and the most\r\npredatory and merciless of all animal species except the wolves, has\r\nrendered a great service to all the birds that live or nest upon the\r\nground. His relentless pursuit and destruction of the savage-tempered,\r\nstrong-jawed fur-bearing animals is in part the salvation of the ground\r\nbirds of to-day and yesterday. If the teeth and claws had been permitted\r\nto multiply unchecked down to the present time, with man's warfare on\r\nthe upland game proceeding as it has done, scores upon scores of species\r\nlong ere this would have been exterminated.\r\n\r\nBut the slaughter of the millions of North American foxes, wolves,\r\nweasels, skunks, and mink has so overwhelmingly reduced the four-footed\r\nenemies of the birds that the balance of wild Nature has been preserved.\r\nAs a rule, the few predatory wild animals that remain are not\r\nslaughtering the birds to a serious extent; and for this we may well be\r\nthankful.\r\n\r\nTHE DOMESTIC CAT.--In such thickly settled communities as our northern\r\nstates, from the Atlantic coast to the sandhills of Kansas and Nebraska,\r\nthe domestic cat is probably the greatest four-footed scourge of bird\r\nlife. Thousands of persons who never have seen a hunting cat in action\r\nwill doubt this statement, but the proof of its truthfulness is only too\r\npainfully abundant.\r\n\r\nUnhappily it is the way of the hunting cat to stalk unseen, and to kill\r\nthe very birds that are most friendly with man, and most helpful to him\r\nin his farming and fruit-growing business. The quail is about the only\r\ngame bird that the cat affects seriously, and to it the cat is very\r\ndestructive. It is the robin, catbird, thrush, bluebird, dove,\r\nwoodpecker, chickadee, phoebe, tanager and other birds of the lawn, the\r\ngarden and orchard that afford good hunting for sly and savage old\r\nThomas.\r\n\r\nWhen I was a boy in my 'teens, I had a lasting series of object lessons\r\non the cat as a predatory animal. Our \"Betty\" was the most ambitious and\r\nsuccessful domestic-cat hunter of wild mammals of which I ever have\r\nheard. To her, rats and mice were mere child's-play, and after a time\r\ntheir pursuit offered such tame sport that she sought fresh fields for\r\nher prowess. Then she brought in young rabbits, chipmunks and\r\nthirteen-lined spermophiles, and once she came in, quite exhausted, half\r\ndragging and half carrying a big, fat pocket gopher. With her it seemed\r\nto be a point of honor that she should bring in her game and display it.\r\nLittle did we realize then that in course of time the wild birds would\r\nbecome so scarce that their slaughter by house cats would demand\r\nlegislative action in the states.\r\n\r\nIn considering the hunting cat, let us call in a credible witness of the\r\neffects of domestic cats on the bob white. The following is an\r\neye-witness report, by Ernest B. Beardsley, in _Outdoor Life_ for April,\r\n1912. The locality was Wellington, Sumner County, Kansas.\r\n\r\n  In the meantime, old Queen was having a high old time up ahead, some\r\n  hundred feet by then, running up the bank and back down in the draw.\r\n  We had hardly caught up when up goes Mr. Savage's gun and he gives\r\n  both barrels. I had seen nothing up to date, but I didn't have long\r\n  to wait, for by the time I got up to him and the dog, they were both\r\n  in the high grass and had a great, big, common gray maltese\r\n  house-cat; and Queen had a half-eaten quail that Mr. Cat was busy\r\n  with when disturbed.\r\n\r\n  Well, we followed the draw across the field and got nine of a covey\r\n  of sixteen that had been ahead of Mr. Cat; and about four o'clock\r\n  that evening we killed another white-and-gray cat. While driving\r\n  home that night, Mr. Savage told me that he had killed fifty or more\r\n  in three or four years. They will get in a draw full of\r\n  tumble-grass, on a cold day when quail don't like to fly, and stay\r\n  right with them; and even after feeding on two or three, they will\r\n  lie and watch, and when the covey moves, they move. When eating time\r\n  comes around they are at it again, and to a covey of young birds\r\n  they are sure death to the whole covey.\r\n\r\n  Well, Will told me never to overlook a house-cat that I found as far\r\n  as a quarter of a mile from a farm or ranch, for if they have not\r\n  already turned wild, they are learning how easy it is to hunt and\r\n  live on game, and are almost as bad. We found Mr. Black-and-White\r\n  Hunter had eaten two quail just before we killed him that evening. I\r\n  would rather not write what Mr. Savage said when we found the\r\n  remains of a partly-eaten bird.\r\n\r\n  My advice is, don't let tame cats get away when found out hunting;\r\n  for the chances are they have not seen a home in months, and maybe\r\n  years,--and say! but they do get big and bad. When you meet one,\r\n  give it to him good, and don't let your dog run up to him until he\r\n  is out for keeps. I learned afterwards that was how Will knew it was\r\n  a cat. Queen had learned to back off and call for help on cats some\r\n  years before.\r\n\r\nIn the New York Zoological Park, we have had troubles of our own with\r\nmarauding cats. They establish themselves in a day, and quickly learn\r\nwhere to seek easy game and good cover. In the daytime they lie close in\r\nthe thick brush, exactly as tigers do in India, but if not molested for\r\na period of days, they become bold and attack game in open view. One\r\nbird-killing cat was so shy of man that it was only after two weeks of\r\nhard hunting (mornings and evenings) that it was killed.\r\n\r\nWe have seen cats catch and kill gray squirrels, chipmunks, robins and\r\nthrushes, and have found the feathers of slaughtered quail. Once we had\r\ngray rabbits breeding in the park, and their number reached between\r\neighty and ninety. For a time they fearlessly hopped about in sight from\r\nour windows, and they were of great interest to visitors and to all of\r\nus. Then the cats began upon them; and in one year there was not a\r\nrabbit to be seen, save at rare intervals. At the same time the\r\nchipmunks of the park were almost exterminated.\r\n\r\nThat was the last straw, and we began a vigorous war upon those wild and\r\npredatory cats. The cats came off second best. We killed every cat that\r\nwas found hunting in the park, and we certainly got some that were big\r\nand bad. We eliminated that pest, and we are keeping it eliminated. And\r\nwith what result?\r\n\r\nIn 1911 a covey of eleven quail came and settled in our grounds, and\r\nhave remained there. Twenty times at least during the past eight months\r\n(winter and spring) I have seen the flock on the granite ledge not more\r\nthan forty feet from the rear window of my office. Last spring when I\r\nleft the Administration Building at six o'clock, after the visitors had\r\ngone, I found two half-grown rabbits calmly roosting on the door-mat.\r\nThe rabbits are slowly coming back, and the chipmunks are visibly\r\nincreasing in number. The gray squirrels now chase over the walks\r\nwithout fear of any living thing, and our ducklings and young guineas\r\nand peacocks are safe once more.\r\n\r\nThat cats destroy annually in the United States several _millions_ of\r\nvery valuable birds, seems fairly beyond question. I believe that in\r\nsettled regions they are worse than weasels, foxes, skunks and mink\r\n_combined_; because there are about one hundred times as many of them,\r\nand those that hunt are not afraid to hunt in the daytime. Of course I\r\nam not saying that _all_ cats hunt wild game; but in the country I\r\nbelieve that fully one-half of them do.\r\n\r\nI am personally acquainted with a cat in Indiana, on the farm of\r\nrelatives, which is notorious for its hunting propensities, and its\r\nremarkable ability in capturing game. Even the lady who is joint owner\r\nof the cat feels very badly about its destructiveness, and has said,\r\nover and over again, that it ought to be killed; but the cat is such a\r\nfamily pet that no one in the family has the heart to destroy it, and as\r\nyet no stranger has come forward to play the part of executioner. The\r\nlady in question assured me that to her certain knowledge that\r\nparticular cat would watch a nestful of young robins week after week\r\nuntil they had grown up to such a size that they were almost ready to\r\nfly; then he would kill them and devour them. Old \"Tommy\" was too wise\r\nto kill the robins when they were unduly small.\r\n\r\nIn a great book entitled _Useful Birds and Their Protection_, by E.H.\r\nForbush, State Ornithologist of Massachusetts, and published by the\r\nMassachusetts State Board of Agriculture in 1905, there appears, on page\r\n362, many interesting facts on this subject. For example:\r\n\r\n  Mr. William Brewster tells of an acquaintance in Maine, who said\r\n  that his cat killed about fifty birds a year. Mr. A.C. Dike wrote\r\n  [to Mr. Forbush] of a cat owned by a family, and well cared for.\r\n  They watched it through one season, and found that it killed\r\n  fifty-eight birds, including the young in five nests.\r\n\r\n  Nearly a hundred correspondents, scattered through all the counties\r\n  of the state, report the cat as one of the greatest enemies of\r\n  birds. The reports that have come in of the torturing and killing of\r\n  birds by cats are absolutely sickening. The number of birds killed\r\n  by them in this state is appalling.\r\n\r\n  Some cat lovers believe that each cat kills on the average not more\r\n  than ten birds a year; but I have learned of two instances where\r\n  more than that number were killed in a single day, and another where\r\n  seven were killed. If we assume, however, that the average cat on\r\n  the farm kills but ten birds per year, and that there is one cat to\r\n  each farm in Massachusetts, we have, in round numbers, seventy\r\n  thousand cats, killing seven hundred thousand birds annually.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A HUNTING CAT AND ITS VICTIM\r\nThis Cat had fed so bountifully on the Rabbits and Squirrels of the\r\nZoological Park, that it ate only the Brain of this Gray Rabbit]\r\n\r\nIn Mr. Forbush's book there is an illustration of the cat which killed\r\nfifty-eight birds in one year, and the animal was photographed with a\r\ndead robin in its mouth. The portrait is reproduced in this chapter.\r\n\r\nLast year, a strong effort was made in Massachusetts to enact a law\r\nrequiring cats to be licensed. On account of the amount of work\r\nnecessary in passing the no-sale-of-game bill, that measure was not\r\npressed, and so it did not become a law; but another year it will\r\nundoubtedly be passed, for it is a good bill, and extremely necessary at\r\nthis time. _Such a law is needed in every state_!\r\n\r\nThere is a mark by which you may instantly and infallibly know the worst\r\nof the wild cats--by their presence _away from home, hunting in the\r\nopen_. Kill all such, wherever found. The harmless cats are domestic in\r\ntheir tastes, and stay close to the family fireside and the kitchen.\r\nBeing properly fed, they have no temptation to become hunters. There are\r\ncats and cats, just as there are men and men: some tolerable, many\r\nutterly intolerable. No sweeping sentiment for _all_ cats should be\r\nallowed to stand in the way of the abatement of the hunting-cat\r\nnuisances.\r\n\r\n_Of all men, the farmer cannot afford the luxury of their existence_! It\r\nis too expensive. With him it is a matter of dollars, and cash out of\r\npocket for every hunting cat that he tolerates in his neighborhood.\r\nThere are two places in which to strike the hunting cats: in the open,\r\nand in the state legislature.\r\n\r\nWhile this chapter was in the hands of the compositors, the hunting cat\r\nand gray rabbit shown in the accompanying illustration were brought in\r\nby a keeper.\r\n\r\nDOGS AS DESTROYERS OF BIRDS.--I have received many letters from\r\nprotectors of wild life informing me that the destruction of\r\nground-nesting birds, and especially of upland game birds, by roaming\r\ndogs, has in some localities become a great curse to bird life.\r\nComplaints of this kind have come from New York, Massachusetts,\r\nConnecticut, Pennsylvania and elsewhere. Usually the culprits are\r\n_hunting dogs_--setters, pointers and hounds.\r\n\r\nNow, surely it is not necessary to set forth here any argument on this\r\nsubject. It is not open to argument, or academic treatment of any kind.\r\nThe cold fact is:\r\n\r\nIn the breeding season of birds, and while the young birds are incapable\r\nof quick and strong flight, all dogs, of every description, should be\r\nrestrained from free hunting; and all dogs found hunting in the woods\r\nduring the season referred to should be arrested, and their owners\r\nshould be fined twenty dollars for each offense. Incidentally, one-half\r\nthe fine should go to the citizen who arrests the dog. The method of\r\nrestraining hunting dogs should devolve upon dog owners; and the law\r\nneed only prohibit or punish the act.\r\n\r\nBeyond a doubt, in states that still possess quail and ruffed grouse,\r\nfree hunting by hunting dogs leads to great destruction of nests and\r\nbroods during the breeding season.\r\n\r\nTELEGRAPH AND TELEPHONE WIRES.--Mr. Daniel C. Beard has strongly called\r\nmy attention to the slaughter of birds by telegraph wires that has come\r\nunder his personal observation. His country home, at Redding,\r\nConnecticut, is near the main line of the New York, New Haven and\r\nHartford Railway, along which a line of very large poles carries a great\r\nnumber of wires. The wires are so numerous that they form a barrier\r\nthrough which it is difficult for any bird to fly and come out alive and\r\nunhurt.\r\n\r\nMr. Beard says that among the birds killed or crippled by flying against\r\nthose wires near Redding he has seen the following species: olive-backed\r\nthrush, white-throated sparrow and other sparrows, oriole, blue jay,\r\nrail, ruffed grouse, and woodcock. It is a common practice for employees\r\nof the railway, and others living along the line, to follow the line and\r\npick up on one excursion enough birds for a pot-pie.\r\n\r\nBeyond question, the telegraph and telephone wires of the United States\r\nannually exact a heavy toll in bird life, and claim countless thousands\r\nof victims. They may well be set down as one of the unseen forces\r\ndestructive to birds.\r\n\r\nNaturally, we ask, what can be done about it?\r\n\r\nI am told that in Scotland such slaughter is prevented by the attachment\r\nof small tags or discs to the telephone wires, at intervals of a few\r\nrods, sufficiently near that they attract the attention of flying birds,\r\nand reveal the line of an obstruction. This system should be adopted in\r\nall regions where the conditions are such that birds kill themselves\r\nagainst telegraph wires, and an excellent place to begin would be along\r\nthe line of the N.Y., N.H. & H. Railway.\r\n\r\nWILD ANIMALS.--Beyond question, it is both desirable and necessary that\r\nany excess of wild animals that prey upon our grouse, quail, pheasants,\r\nwoodcock, snipe, mallard duck, shore birds and other species that nest\r\non the ground, should be killed. Since we must choose between the two,\r\nthe birds have it! Weasels and foxes and skunks are interesting, and\r\nthey do much to promote the hilarity of life in rural districts, but\r\nthey do not destroy insects, and are of comparatively little value as\r\ndestroyers of the noxious rodents that prey upon farm crops. While a few\r\npersons may dispute the second half of this proposition, the burden of\r\nproof that my view is wrong will rest upon them; and having spent\r\neighteen years \"on the farm,\" I think I am right. If there is any\r\npositive evidence tending to prove that the small carnivores that we\r\nclass as \"vermin\" are industrious and persistent destroyers of noxious\r\nrodents--pocket gophers, moles, field-mice and rats--or that they do not\r\nkill wild birds numerously, now is the time to produce it, because the\r\ntide of public sentiment is strongly setting against the weasels, mink,\r\nfoxes and skunks. (Once upon a time, a shrewd young man in the\r\nZoological Park discovered a weasel hiding behind a stone while\r\ndevouring a sparrow that it had just caught and killed. He stalked it\r\nsuccessfully, seized it in his bare hand, and, even though bitten, made\r\ngood the capture.)\r\n\r\nThe State of Pennsylvania is extensively wooded, with forests and with\r\nbrush which affords excellent home quarters and breeding grounds for\r\nmammalian \"vermin.\" The small predatory mammals are so seriously\r\ndestructive to ruffed grouse and other ground birds that the State Game\r\nCommission is greatly concerned. When the hunter's license law is\r\nenacted, as it very surely will be at the next session of the\r\nlegislature (1913), a portion of the $70,000 that it will produce each\r\nyear will be used by the commission in paying bounties on the\r\ndestruction of the surplus of vermin. Through the pursuit of vermin, any\r\nfarmer can easily win enough bounties to more than pay the cost of his\r\nannual hunting license (one dollar), and the farmers' boys will find a\r\nnew interest in life.\r\n\r\nIn some portions of the Rocky Mountain region, the assaults of the large\r\npredatory mammals and birds on the young of the big-game species\r\noccasionally demand special treatment. In the Yellowstone Park the pumas\r\nmultiplied to such an extent and killed so many young elk that their\r\nnumber had to be systematically reduced. To that end \"Buffalo\" Jones was\r\nsent out by the Government to find and destroy the intolerable surplus\r\nof pumas. In the course of his campaign he killed about forty, much to\r\nthe benefit of the elk herds. Around the entrance to the den of a big\r\nold male puma, Mr. Jones found the skulls and other remains of nine elk\r\ncalves that \"the old Tom\" had killed and carried there.\r\n\r\nPumas and lynxes attack and kill mountain sheep; and the golden eagle is\r\nvery partial to mountain sheep lambs and mountain goat kids. It will not\r\nanswer to permit birds of that bold and predatory species to become too\r\nnumerous in mountains inhabited by goats and sheep; and the fewer the\r\nmountain lions the better, for they, like the lynx and eagle, have\r\nnothing to live upon save the game.\r\n\r\nThe wolves and coyotes have learned to seek the ranges of cattle,\r\nhorses and sheep, where they still do immense damage, chiefly in\r\nkilling young stock. In spite of the great sums that have been paid out\r\nby western states in bounties for the destruction of wolves, in many,\r\nmany places the gray wolf still persists, and can not be exterminated.\r\nTo the stockmen of the west the wolf question is a serious matter. The\r\nstockmen of Montana say that a government expert once told them how to\r\nget rid of the gray wolves. His instructions were: \"Locate the dens, and\r\nkill the young in the dens, soon after they are born!\" \"All very easy to\r\n_say_, but a trifle difficult to _do_!\" said my informant; and the\r\nranchman seem to think they are yet a long way from a solution of the\r\nwolf question.\r\n\r\nDuring the past year the destruction of noxious predatory animals in the\r\nnational forest reserves has seriously occupied the attention of the\r\nUnited States Bureau of Forestry. By the foresters of that bureau the\r\nfollowing animals were destroyed in fifteen western states:\r\n\r\n6,487 Coyotes\r\n  870 Wild-Cats\r\n   72 Lynxes\r\n  213 Bears\r\n   88 Mountain Lions\r\n  172 Gray Wolves\r\n   69 Wolf Pups\r\n-----\r\n7,971\r\n\r\nIn 1910 the total was 9,103.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE EASTERN RED SQUIRREL\r\nA Great Destroyer of Birds]\r\n\r\nTHE RED SQUIRREL.--Once in a great while, conditions change in subtle\r\nways, wild creatures unexpectedly increase in number, and a community\r\nawakens to the fact that some wild species has become a public nuisance.\r\nIn a small city park, even gray squirrels may breed and become so\r\nfearfully numerous that, in their restless quest for food, they may\r\nravage the nests of the wild birds, kill and devour the young, and\r\nbecome a pest. In the Zoological Park, in 1903, we found that the red\r\nsquirrels had increased to such a horde that they were driving out all\r\nour nesting wild birds, driving out the gray squirrels, and making\r\nthemselves intolerably obnoxious. We shot sixty of them, and brought the\r\ntotal down to a reasonable number. Wherever he is or whatever his\r\nnumerical strength, the red squirrel is a bad citizen, and, while we do\r\nnot by any means favor his extermination, he should resolutely be kept\r\nwithin bounds by the rifle.\r\n\r\nWhen a crow nested in our woods, near the Beaver Pond, we were greatly\r\npleased; but with the feeding of the first brood, the crows began to\r\ncarry off ducklings from the wild-fowl pond. After one crow had been\r\nseen to seize and carry away _five_ young ducks in one forenoon, we\r\ndecided that the constitutional limit had been reached, for we did not\r\npropose that all our young mallards should be swept into the awful\r\nvortex of that crow nest. We took those young crows and reared them by\r\nhand; but the old one had acquired a bad habit, and she persisted in\r\ncarrying off young ducks until we had to end her existence with a gun.\r\nIt was a painful operation, but there was no other way.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COOPER'S HAWK\r\nA Species to be Destroyed]\r\n\r\nBIRD-DESTROYING BIRDS.--There are several species of birds that may at\r\nonce be put under sentence of death for their destructiveness of useful\r\nbirds, without any extenuating circumstances worth mentioning. Four of\r\nthese are _Cooper's Hawk_, the _Sharp-Shinned Hawk, Pigeon Hawk_ and\r\n_Duck Hawk_. Fortunately these species are not so numerous that we need\r\nlose any sleep over them. Indeed, I think that today it would be a\r\nmighty good collector who could find one specimen in seven days'\r\nhunting. Like all other species, these, too, are being shot out of our\r\nbird fauna.\r\n\r\nSeveral species of bird-eating birds are trembling in the balance, and\r\nunder grave suspicion. Some of them are the _Great Horned Owl, Screech\r\nOwl, Butcher Bird_ or _Great Northern Shrike_. The only circumstance\r\nthat saves these birds from instant condemnation is the delightful\r\namount of rats, mice, moles, gophers and noxious insects that they\r\nannually consume. In view of the awful destructiveness of the accursed\r\nbubonic-plague-carrying rat, we are impelled to think long before\r\nplacing in our killing list even the great horned owl, who really does\r\nlevy a heavy tax on our upland game birds. As to the butcher bird, we\r\nfeel that we ought to kill him, but in view of his record on wild mice\r\nand rats, we hesitate, and finally decline.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHARP-SHINNED HAWK\r\nA Species to be Destroyed]\r\n\r\nSNAKES.--Mr. Thomas M. Upp, a close and long observer of wild things\r\nwishes it distinctly understood that while the common black-snakes and\r\nracers are practically harmless to birds, the _Pilot Black-Snake_,\r\n--long, thick and truculent,--is a great scourge to nesting birds. It\r\nseems to be deserving of death. Mr. Upp speaks from personal knowledge,\r\nand his condemnation of the species referred to is quite sweeping. At\r\nthe same time Mr. Raymond L. Ditmars points out the fact that this\r\nserpent feeds during 6 months of the year on mice, and in doing so\r\nrenders good service. In the South it is called the \"Mouse Snake.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CAT THAT KILLED 58 BIRDS IN ONE YEAR\r\nFrom Mr. Forbush's Book\r\nPhoto by A.C. Dyke]\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE DESTRUCTION OF WILD LIFE BY DISEASES\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery cause that has the effect of reducing the total of wild-life\r\npopulation is now a matter of importance to mankind. The violent and\r\nuniversal disturbance of the balance of Nature that already has taken\r\nplace throughout the temperate and frigid zone offers not only food for\r\nthought, but it calls for vigorous action.\r\n\r\nThere are vast sections in the populous centres of western civilization\r\nwhere the destruction of species, even to the point of extermination, is\r\nfairly inevitable. It is the way of Christian man to destroy all wild\r\nlife that comes within the sphere of influence of his iron heel. With\r\nthe exception of the big game, this destruction is largely a\r\ntemperamental result, peculiar to the highest civilization. In India\r\nwhere the same fields have been plowed for wheat and dahl and raggi for\r\nat least 2,000 years, the Indian antelope, or \"black buck,\" the saras\r\ncrane and the adjutant stalk through the crops, and the nilgai and\r\ngazelle inhabit the eroded ravines in an agricultural land that averages\r\n1,200 people to the square mile!\r\n\r\nWe have seen that even in farming country, where mud villages are as\r\nthick as farm houses in Nebraska, wild animals and even hoofed game can\r\nlive and hold their own through hundreds of years of close association\r\nwith man. The explanation is that the Hindus regard wild animals as\r\ncreatures entitled to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, and\r\nthey are not anxious to shoot every wild animal that shows its head. In\r\nthe United States, nearly every game-inhabited community is animated by\r\na feeling that every wild animal must necessarily be killed as soon as\r\nseen; and this sentiment often leads to disgraceful things. For\r\ninstance, in some parts of New England a deer straying into a town is at\r\nonce beset by the hue and cry, and it is chased and assaulted until it\r\nis dead, by violent and disgraceful means. New York State, however,\r\nseems to have outgrown that spirit. During the past ten years, at least\r\na dozen deer in distress have been rescued from the Hudson River, or in\r\ninland towns, or in barnyards in the suburbs of Yonkers and New York,\r\nand carefully cared for until \"the zoo people\" could be communicated\r\nwith. Last winter about 13 exhausted grebes and one loon were picked up,\r\ncared for and finally shipped with tender care to the Zoological Park.\r\nOne distressed dovekie was picked up, but failed to survive.\r\n\r\nThe sentiment for the conservation of wild life has changed the mental\r\nattitude of very many people. The old Chinese-Malay spirit which cries\r\n\"Kill! Kill!\" and at once runs amuck among suddenly discovered wild\r\nanimals, is slowly being replaced by a more humane and intelligent\r\nsentiment. This is one of the hopeful and encouraging signs of the\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nThe destruction of wild animals by natural causes is an interesting\r\nsubject, even though painful. We need to know how much destruction is\r\nwrought by influences wholly beyond the control of man, and a few cases\r\nmust be cited.\r\n\r\nRINDERPEST IN AFRICA.--Probably the greatest slaughter ever wrought upon\r\nwild animals by diseases during historic times, was by rinderpest, a\r\ncattle plague which afflicted Africa in the last decade of the previous\r\ncentury. Originally, the disease reached Africa by way of Egypt, and\r\ncame as an importation from Europe. From Egypt it steadily traveled\r\nsouthward, reaching Somaliland in 1889. In 1896 it reached the Zambesi\r\nRiver and entered Rhodesia. From thence it went on southward almost to\r\nthe Cape. Not only did it sweep away ninety percent of the native cattle\r\nbut it also destroyed more than seventy-five per cent of the buffalos,\r\nantelopes and other hoofed game of Rhodesia. It was feared that many\r\nspecies would be completely exterminated, but happily that fear was not\r\nrealized. The buffalo and antelope herds were fifteen years in breeding\r\nup again to a reasonable number, but thanks to the respite from hunters\r\nwhich they enjoyed for several years, finally they did recover.\r\nThroughout British East Africa the supply of big game in 1905 was very\r\ngreat, but since that time it has been very greatly diminished by\r\nshooting.\r\n\r\nCARIBOU DISEASE.--From time to time reports have come from the Province\r\nof Quebec, and I think from Maine and New Brunswick also, of many\r\ncaribou having died of disease. The nature of that disease has remained\r\na mystery, because it seems that no pathologist ever has had an\r\nopportunity to investigate it. Fortunately, however, the alleged disease\r\nnever has been sufficiently wide-spread or continuous to make\r\nappreciable inroads on the total number of caribou, and apparently the\r\ntrouble has been local.\r\n\r\nSCAB IN MOUNTAIN SHEEP.--\"Scab\" is a contagious and persistent skin\r\ndisease that affects sheep, and is destructive when not controlled.\r\nFifteen years ago it prevailed in some portions of the west. In Colorado\r\nit has several times been reported that many bighorn mountain sheep were\r\nkilled by \"scab,\" which was contracted on wild mountain pastures that\r\nhad been gone over by domestic sheep carrying that disease. From the\r\nreports current at that time, we inferred that about 200 mountain sheep\r\nhad been affected. It was feared that the disease would spread through\r\nthe wild flocks and become general, but this did not occur. It seems\r\nthat the remnant flocks had become so isolated from one another that the\r\nisolation of the affected flocks saved the others.\r\n\r\nLUMPY-JAW IN ANTELOPE AND SHEEP.--It is a lamentable fact that some, at\r\nleast, of the United States herds of prong-horned antelope are afflicted\r\nwith a very deadly chronic infective disease known as actinomycosis, or\r\nlumpy-jaw. It has been brought into the Zoological Park five times, by\r\nspecimens shipped from Colorado, Texas, Wyoming and Montana. I think our\r\nfirst cases came to us in 1902.\r\n\r\nIn its early stage this disease is so subtle and slow that it is months\r\nin developing; and this feature renders it all the more deadly, through\r\nthe spread of infection long before the ailment can be discovered.\r\n\r\nOne of our antelope arrivals, apparently in perfect health when\r\nreceived, was on general principles kept isolated in rigid quarantine\r\nfor two months. At the expiration of that period, no disease of any kind\r\nhaving become manifest, the animal was placed on exhibition, with two\r\nothers that had been in the Park for more than a year, in perfect\r\nhealth.\r\n\r\nIn one more week the late arrival developed a swelling on its jaw,\r\ndrooled at the corner of the mouth, and became feverish,--sure symptoms\r\nof the dread disease. At once it was removed and isolated, but in about\r\n10 days it died. The other two antelopes were promptly attacked, and\r\neventually died.\r\n\r\nThe course of the disease is very intense, and thus far it has proven\r\nincurable in our wild animals. We have lost about 10 antelopes from it,\r\nand one deer, usually, in each case, within ten days or two weeks from\r\nthe discovery of the first outward sign,--the well known swelling on the\r\njaw. One case that was detected immediately upon arrival was very\r\npersistently treated by Dr. Blair, and the animal actually survived for\r\nfour months, but finally it succumbed. From first to last not a single\r\ncase was cured.\r\n\r\nIn 1912, the future of the prong-horned antelope in real captivity seems\r\nhopeless. We have decided not to bring any more specimens to our\r\ninstitution, partly because all available candidates seem reasonably\r\ncertain to be affected with lumpy-jaw, and partly because we are\r\nunwilling to run further risks of having other hoofed animals inoculated\r\nby them. Today we are anxiously wondering whether the jaw disease of the\r\nprong-horn is destined to exterminate the species. Such a catastrophe is\r\nmuch to be feared. This is probably one of the reasons why the antelope\r\nis steadily disappearing, despite protection.\r\n\r\nIn 1906 we discovered the existence of actinomycosis among the black\r\nmountain sheep of northern British Columbia. Two specimens out of six\r\nwere badly affected, the bones of the jaws being greatly enlarged, and\r\nperforated by deep pits. The black sheep of the Stickine and Iskoot\r\nregions are so seldom seen by white men, save when a sportsman kills his\r\nallotment of three specimens, we really do not know anything about the\r\nextent to which actinomycosis prevails in those herds, or how deadly are\r\nits effects. One thing seems quite certain, from the appearance of the\r\ndiseased skulls found by the writer in the taxidermic laboratory of\r\nFrederick Sauter, in New York. The enormous swelling of the diseased jaw\r\nbones clearly indicates a disease that in some cases affects its victim\r\nthroughout many months. Such a condition as we found in those sheep\r\ncould not have been reached in a few days after the disease became\r\napparent. Now, in our antelopes, the collapse and death of the victim\r\nusually occurred in about 10 days from the time that the first swelling\r\nwas observed: which means a very virulent disease, and rapid progress at\r\nthe climax. The jaw of one of our antelopes, which was figured in Dr.\r\nBlair's paper in the Eleventh Annual Report of the New York Zoological\r\nSociety (1906) shows only a very slight lesion, in comparison with those\r\nof the mountain sheep.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion is that among the sheep, this disease does not carry off\r\nits victims in any short period like 10 days. The animal must survive\r\nfor some months after it becomes apparent. At least two parties of\r\nAmerican sportsmen have shot rams afflicted with this disease, but I\r\nhave no reports of any sheep having been found dead from this cause.\r\n\r\nThis disease is well known among domestic cattle, but so far as we are\r\naware it never before has been found among wild animals. The black sheep\r\nherds wherein it was found in British Columbia are absolutely isolated\r\nfrom domestic cattle and all their influences, and therefore it seems\r\nquite certain that the disease developed among the sheep\r\nspontaneously,--a remarkable episode, to say the least. Whether it will\r\nexterminate the black mountain sheep species, and in time spread to the\r\nwhite sheep of the northwest, is of course a matter of conjecture; but\r\nthere is nothing in the world to prevent a calamity of that kind. The\r\nwhite sheep of Yukon Territory range southward until in the Sheslay\r\nMountains they touch the sphere of influence of the black sheep, where\r\nthe disease could easily be transmitted. It would be a good thing if\r\nthere existed between the two species a sheepless zone about 200 miles\r\nwide.\r\n\r\nI greatly fear that actinomycosis is destined to play an important part\r\nin the final extinction that seems to be the impending fate of the\r\nbeautiful and valuable prong-horned antelope. In view of our hard\r\nexperiences, extending through ten years (1902-1912), I think this fear\r\nis justified. All persons who live in country still inhabited by\r\nantelope are urged to watch for this disease. If any antelopes are found\r\ndead, see if the lower jaw is badly swollen and discharging pus. If it\r\nis, bury the body quickly, burn the ground over, and advise the writer\r\nregarding the case.\r\n\r\nTHE RABBIT PLAGUE.--One of the strangest freaks of Nature of which we\r\nknow as effecting the wholesale destruction of wild animals by disease\r\nis the rabbit plague. In the northern wilderness, and particularly\r\ncentral Canada, where rabbits exist in great numbers and supply the\r\nwants of a large carnivorous population, this plague is well known, and\r\namong trappers and woodsmen is a common topic of conversation. The best\r\ntreatment of the subject is to be found in Ernest T. Seton's \"Life\r\nHistories of Northern Animals\", Vol. I, p. 640 et seq. From this I\r\nquote:\r\n\r\n\"Invariably the year of greatest numbers [of rabbits] is followed by a\r\nyear of plague, which sweeps them away, leaving few or no rabbits in the\r\nland. The denser the rabbit population, the more drastically is it\r\nravaged by the plague. They are wiped out in a single spring by\r\nepidemic diseases usually characterized by swellings of the throat,\r\nsores under the armpits and groins, and by diarrhea.\"\r\n\r\n\"The year 1885 was for the country around Carberry 'a rabbit year,' the\r\ngreatest ever known in that country. The number of rabbits was\r\nincredible. W.R. Hine killed 75 in two hours, and estimated that he\r\ncould have killed 500 in a day. The farmers were stricken with fear that\r\nthe rabbit pest of Australia was to be repeated in Manitoba. But the\r\nyears 1886-7 changed all that. The rabbits died until their bodies\r\ndotted the country in thousands. The plague seemed to kill all the\r\nmembers of the vast host of 1885.\"\r\n\r\nThe strangest item of Mr. Seton's story is yet to be told. In 1890 Mr.\r\nSeton stocked his park at Cos Cob, Conn., with hares and rabbits from\r\nseveral widely separated localities. In 1903, the plague came and swept\r\nthem all away. Mr. Seton sent specimens to the Zoological Park for\r\nexamination by the Park veterinary surgeon, Dr. W. Reid Blair. They were\r\nfound to be infested by great numbers of a dangerous bloodsucking\r\nparasite known as _Strongylus strigosus_, which produces death by anemia\r\nand emaciation. There were hundreds of those parasites in each animal. I\r\nassisted in the examination, and was shown by Dr. Blair, under the\r\nmicroscope, that _Strongylus_ puts forth eggs literally by hundreds of\r\nthousands!\r\n\r\nThe life history of that parasite is not well known, but it may easily\r\ndevelop that the cycle of its maximum destructiveness is seven years,\r\nand therefore it may be accountable for the seven-year plague among the\r\nhares and rabbits of the northern United States and Canada.\r\n\r\nPossibly _Strongylus strigosus_ is all that stands between Canada and a\r\npest of rabbits like that of Australia. Just why this parasite is\r\ninoperative in Australia, or why it has not been introduced there to\r\nlessen the rabbit evil, we do not know. Mr. Seton declares that the\r\nrabbits of his park were \"subject to all the ills of the flesh, except\r\npossibly writer's paralysis and housemaid's knee.\"\r\n\r\nPARASITIC INFECTION OF WILD DUCKS.--The diseases of wild game,\r\nespecially waterfowl, grouse and quail, have caused heavy losses in\r\nAmerica as well as in European countries, and scientists have been\r\ncarefully investigating the cause and the general nature of the\r\nmaladies, as well as probable methods of prevention and cure. Mr. Geo.\r\nAtkinson, a well-known practical naturalist of Portage la Prairie,\r\nManitoba, writes as follows to a local paper on this subject, which I\r\nfind quoted in the _National Sportsman_:\r\n\r\n  The question which has developed these important proportions during\r\n  the past year is that of the extent of the parasitic infection of\r\n  our wild ducks and other game, and the possibilities of the extended\r\n  transmission of these parasites to domestic stock, or even humanity,\r\n  by eating.\r\n\r\n  The parasites in question are contained in small elliptical cases\r\n  found underlying the surface muscles of the breast, and in advanced\r\n  cases extending deeper into the flesh and the muscular tissues of\r\n  the legs and wings. They are not noticeable in the ordinary process\r\n  of plucking the bird for the table, and are not found internally, so\r\n  that the only method of discovering their presence is by slitting\r\n  the skin of the breast and paring it back a few inches when the\r\n  worm-like sacs will be seen buried in the flesh.\r\n\r\n  These parasites have come to my notice periodically during the\r\n  process of skinning birds for mounting during the past number of\r\n  years, but it was only when they appeared in unusual numbers last\r\n  fall that I made inquiries of the biological bureaus of Washington\r\n  and Ottawa for information of their life history and the\r\n  possibilities of their transmission to other hosts.\r\n\r\n  Replies from these sources surprised me with the information that\r\n  very little was known of the life history of any of the\r\n  Sarcosporidia, of which group this was a species. Nothing was known\r\n  of the method of infection or the transference from host to host or\r\n  species to species, and both departments asked for specimens for\r\n  examination.\r\n\r\n  Authorities are a unit in opinion that the question is one of great\r\n  importance to game conservation, and although opinions of the\r\n  dangers from eating differ somewhat, a record is given of a hog fed\r\n  upon affected flesh developing parasites in the muscles in six\r\n  weeks' time, while a case of a man's death from dropsy was found to\r\n  be the result of development of these parasites in the valves of the\r\n  heart.\r\n\r\n  The ability of these low forms of life to withstand extremes of heat\r\n  makes it necessary for more than ordinary cooking to be assured of\r\n  killing them, and since their presence is unnoted in the ordinary\r\n  course of dressing the birds for the table, there is little doubt\r\n  that very considerable numbers of these parasites are consumed at\r\n  our tables every season, with results at present unknown to us.\r\n\r\n  The species I have found most particularly infected have been\r\n  mallards, shovellers, teal, gadwall and pintails, and the birds,\r\n  outwardly in the best condition, have frequently been found loaded\r\n  with sacs of these parasites and only the turning back of the breast\r\n  skin can disclose their presence.\r\n\r\nThe greatest slaughter of wild ducks by disease occurred on Great Salt\r\nLake, Utah. Until the \"duck disease\" (intestinal coccidiosis) broke out\r\nthere, in the summer of 1910, the annual market slaughter of ducks at\r\nthe mouth of Bear River had been enormous. When at Salt Lake City in\r\n1888 I made an effort to arouse the sportsmen whom I met to the\r\nnecessity of a reform, but my exhortations fell on deaf ears. Naturally,\r\nthe sweeping away of the remaining ducks by disease would suggest a\r\nheaven-sent judgment upon the slaughterers were it not for the fact that\r\nthe last state of the unfortunate ducks is if anything worse than the\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\nOn Oct. 17, 1911, the annual report of the chief of the Biological\r\nSurvey contained the following information on this subject:\r\n\r\n  _Epidemic Among Wild Ducks on Great Salt Lake_.--Following a long\r\n  dry season, which favored the rearing of a large number of wild\r\n  ducks, but materially reduced the area of the feeding ponds,\r\n  resulting in great overcrowding, a severe epidemic broke out about\r\n  August 1, 1910, among the wild ducks about Great Salt Lake, Utah.\r\n  Dead ducks could be counted by thousands along the shores and the\r\n  disease raged unabated until late fall. Shooting clubs found it\r\n  necessary to declare a closed season. Some of the dead ducks were\r\n  forwarded to the Biological Survey and were turned over for\r\n  examination to the Bureau of Animal Industry, by the experts of\r\n  which the disease was diagnosed as intestinal coccidiosis.\r\n\r\n  Various plans of relieving the situation were tried. The irrigation\r\n  ditches were closed, thus providing the sloughs and ponds with fresh\r\n  water, and lime was sprinkled on the mud flats and duck trails.\r\n  Great improvement followed this treatment, and experiments proved\r\n  that ducks provided with abundant fresh water and clean food began\r\n  to recover immediately. These methods promised success, but later it\r\n  was proposed that the marshes be drained and exposed to the sun's\r\n  rays--a course which cannot be recommended. That coccidia are not\r\n  always killed by exposure to the sun is shown by their survival on\r\n  the sites of old chicken yards. An added disadvantage of the plan is\r\n  that draining and drying the marshes would have a bad effect on the\r\n  natural duck food, and upon the birds themselves.\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nDESTRUCTION OF WILD LIFE BY THE ELEMENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a fixed condition of Nature that whenever and wherever a wild\r\nspecies exists in a state of nature, free from the trammels and\r\nlimitations that contact with man always imposes, the species is fitted\r\nto survive all ordinary climatic influences. Freedom of action, and the\r\nexercise of several options in the line of individual maintenance under\r\nstress, is essential to the welfare of every wild species.\r\n\r\nA prong-horned antelope herd that is free can drift before a blizzard,\r\ncan keep from freezing by the exercise, and eventually come to shelter.\r\nLet that same herd drift against a barbed-wire fence five miles long,\r\nand its whole scheme of self-preservation is upset. The herd perishes\r\nthen and there.\r\n\r\nCut out the undergrowth of a given section, drain the swamps and mow\r\ndown all the weeds and tall grass, and the next particularly hard winter\r\nstarves and freezes the quail.\r\n\r\nNaturally the cutting of forests, clearing of brush and drainage of\r\nmarshes is more or less calamitous to all the species of birds that\r\ninhabit such places and find there winter food and shelter. Red-winged\r\nblackbirds and real estate booms can not inhabit the same swamps\r\ncontemporaneously. Before the relentless march of civilization, the wild\r\nIndian, the bison and many of the wild birds must inevitably disappear.\r\nWe cannot change conditions that are as inexorable as death itself. The\r\nwild life must either adjust itself to the conditions that civilized man\r\nimposes upon it, or perish. I say \"civilized man,\" for the reason that\r\nthe primitive races of man are not deadly exterminators of species, as\r\nwe are. I know of not one species of wild life that has been\r\nexterminated by savage man without the aid of his civilized peers.\r\n\r\nAs civilization marches ever onward, over the prairies, into the bad\r\nlands and the forests, over the mountains and even into the farthest\r\ncorner of Death Valley, the desert of deserts, the struggle of the wild\r\nbirds, mammals and fishes is daily and hourly intensified. Man must help\r\nthem to maintain themselves, or accept a lifeless continent. The best\r\nhelp consists in letting the wild creatures throughly alone, so that\r\nthey can help themselves; but quail often need to be fed in critical\r\nperiods. The best food is wheat screenings placed under little tents of\r\nstraw, bringing food and shelter together.\r\n\r\nIn the well settled portions of the United States, such species as\r\nquail, ruffed grouse, wild turkey, pinnated grouse and sage grouse hang\r\nto life by slender threads. A winter of exceptionally deep snows, much\r\nsleet, and a late spring always causes grave anxiety among the state\r\ngame wardens. In Pennsylvania a very earnest movement is in progress to\r\neducate and persuade farmers to feed the quail in winter, and much good\r\nis being done in that direction.\r\n\r\nMr. Erasmus Wilson, of the _Pittsburgh Gazette-Times_ is the apostle of\r\nthat movement.\r\n\r\n_Quail should be fed every winter, in every northern state_. The methods\r\nto be pursued will be mentioned elsewhere.\r\n\r\nBy way of illustration, here is a sample game report, from Las Animas,\r\nColorado, Feb. 22, 1912:\r\n\r\n\"After the most severe winter weather experienced for twenty years we\r\nare able to compute approximately our loss of feathered life. It is\r\nseventy-five per cent of the quail throughout the irrigated district,\r\nand about twenty per cent of meadow-larks. In the rough cedar-covered\r\nsections south of the Arkansas River, the loss among the quail was much\r\nlighter. The ground sparrows suffered severely, while the English\r\nsparrow seems to have come through in good shape. Many cotton-tail\r\nrabbits starved to death, while the deep, light snow of January made\r\nthem easy prey for hawks and coyotes.\" (F.T. Webber).\r\n\r\nIt would be possible to record many instances similar to the above, but\r\nwhy multiply them? And now behold the cruel corollary:\r\n\r\nAt least twenty-five times during the past two years I have heard and\r\nread arguments by sportsmen against my proposal for a 5-year close\r\nseason for quail, taking the ground that \"The sportsmen are not wholly\r\nto blame for the scarcity of quail. It is the cold winters that kill\r\nthem off!\"\r\n\r\nSo then, _because the fierce winters murder the bob white, wholesale,\r\nthey should not have a chance to recover themselves_! Could human beings\r\npossibly assume a more absurd attitude?\r\n\r\nYes, it is coldly and incontestably true, that even after such winter\r\nslaughter as Mr. Webber has reported above, the very next season will\r\nfind the quail hunter joyously taking the field, his face beaming with\r\nhealth and good living, to hunt down and shoot to death as many as\r\npossible of the pitiful 25 per cent remnant that managed to survive the\r\npitiless winter. How many quail hunters, think you, ever stayed their\r\nhands because of \"a hard winter on the quail?\" I warrant not one out of\r\nevery hundred! How many states in this Union ever put on a close season\r\nbecause of a hard winter? I'll warrant that not one ever did; and I\r\nthink there is only one state whose game commissioners have the power to\r\nact in that way without recourse to the legislature. This situation is\r\nintolerable.\r\n\r\nThanks to the splendid codified game laws enacted in New York state in\r\n1912, our Conservation Commission can declare a close season in any\r\nlocality, for any length of time, when the state of the game demands an\r\nemergency measure. This act is as follows; and it is a model law, which\r\nevery other state should speedily enact:\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\n  THE NEW YORK CLOSE-SEASON LAW.\r\n\r\n  _152. Petition for additional protection; notice of hearings; power\r\n  to grant additional protection; notice of prohibition or regulation;\r\n  penalties_.\r\n\r\n  _1. Petition for additional protection_. Any citizen of the state\r\n  may file with the commission a petition in writing requesting it to\r\n  give any species of fish, other than migratory food fish of the sea,\r\n  or game protected by law, additional or other protection than that\r\n  afforded by the provisions of this article. Such petition shall\r\n  state the grounds upon which such protection is considered\r\n  necessary, and shall be signed by the petitioner with his address.\r\n\r\n  _2. Notice of hearings_. The commission shall hold a public hearing\r\n  in the locality or county to be affected upon the allegations of\r\n  such petition within twenty days from the filing thereof. At least\r\n  ten days prior to such hearing notice thereof, stating the time and\r\n  place at which such hearing shall be held, shall be advertised in a\r\n  newspaper published in the county to be affected by such additional\r\n  or other protection. Such notice shall state the name and the\r\n  address of the petitioner, together with a brief statement of the\r\n  grounds upon which such application is made, and a copy thereof\r\n  shall be mailed to the petitioner at the address given in such\r\n  petition at least ten days before such hearing.\r\n\r\n  _3. Power to grant additional protection_. If upon such hearing the\r\n  commission shall determine that such species of fish or game, by\r\n  reason of disease, danger of extermination, or from any other cause\r\n  or reason, requires such additional or other protection, in any\r\n  locality or throughout the state, the commission shall have power to\r\n  prohibit or regulate, during the open season therefor, the taking of\r\n  such species of fish or game. Such prohibition or regulation may be\r\n  made general throughout the state or confined to a particular part\r\n  or district thereof.\r\n\r\n  _4. Notice of prohibition or regulation_. Any order made by the\r\n  commission under the provisions of this section shall be signed by\r\n  it, and entered in its minute book. At least thirty days before such\r\n  prohibition or regulation shall take effect, copies of the same\r\n  shall be filed in the office of the clerk issuing hunting and\r\n  trapping licenses for the district to which the prohibition or\r\n  regulation applies. It shall be the duty of said clerks to issue a\r\n  copy of said prohibition or regulation to each person to whom a\r\n  hunting or trapping license is issued by them; to mail a copy of\r\n  such prohibition or regulation to each holder of a hunting and\r\n  trapping license theretofore issued by them and at that time in\r\n  effect, and to post a copy thereof in a conspicuous place in their\r\n  office. At least thirty days before such prohibition or regulation\r\n  shall take effect the commission shall cause a notice thereof to be\r\n  advertised in a newspaper published in the county wherein such\r\n  prohibition or regulation shall take effect.\r\n\r\n  _5. Penalties_. Any person violating the provisions of such\r\n  prohibition, rule or regulation shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and\r\n  shall, upon conviction, be subject to a fine of not to exceed one\r\n  hundred dollars, or shall be imprisoned for not more than thirty\r\n  days, or both, for each offense, in addition to the penalties\r\n  hereinafter provided for taking fish, birds or quadrupeds in the\r\n  close season.\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nI want all sensible, honest sportsmen to stop citing the killing of game\r\nbirds by severe winters _as a reason_ why long close seasons are not\r\nnecessary, and why automatic guns \"don't matter.\" And I want sportsmen\r\nto consider their duty, and not go out hunting any game species that has\r\nbeen slaughtered by a hard winter, until it has had at least five years\r\nin which to recover. Any other course is cruel, selfish, and\r\nshortsighted; and a word to the humane should be sufficient.\r\n\r\nThe worst exhibitions ever made of the wolfish instinct to slay that\r\nsprings eternal in some human (!) breasts are those brought about\r\nthrough the distress or errors of wild animals. By way of illustration,\r\nconsider the slaughter of half-starved elk that took place in the edge\r\nof Idaho in the winter of 1909 and 1910, when about seven hundred elk\r\nthat were driven out of the Yellowstone Park at its northwestern corner\r\nby the deep snow, fled into Idaho in the hope of finding food. The\r\ninhabitants met the starving herds with repeating rifles, and as the\r\nunfortunate animals struggled westward through the snow and storm, they\r\nwere slaughtered without mercy. Bulls and cows, old and young, all of\r\nthe seven hundred, went down; and Stoney Indians could not have acted\r\nany worse than did those \"settlers.\"\r\n\r\nOn another occasion, it is recorded that the prong-horned antelope herd\r\nof the Mammoth Hot Springs wandered across the line into Gardiner, and\r\nquickly met a savage attack of gunners with rifles. A number of those\r\nrare and valuable animals were killed, and others fled back into the\r\nPark with broken legs dangling in the air.\r\n\r\nIn the interest of public decency, and for the protection of the\r\nreputation of American citizenship, one of two things should be done.\r\nThe northern boundary of the Park should be extended northward beyond\r\nGardiner, or else the deathtrap should be moved elsewhere. The case of\r\nthe town of Gardiner is referred to the legislature of Montana for\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\nBeyond question, the highest sentiments of humanity are those that are\r\nstirred by the misfortunes of killable game. During the past thirty\r\nyears, I have noticed some interesting manifestations of the increased\r\nsympathy for wild creatures that steadily is growing in a large section\r\nof the public mind. Thirty years ago, the appearance of a deer or moose\r\nin the streets of any eastern village nearly always was in itself a\r\nsignal for a grand chase of the unfortunate creature, and its speedy\r\nslaughter. Today, in the eastern states, the general feeling is quite\r\ndifferent. The appearance of a deer in the Hudson River itself, or a\r\nmoose in a Maine village is a signal, not for a wild chase and cruel\r\nslaughter, but for a general effort to save the animal from being hurt,\r\nor killed. I know this through ocular proof, at least half a dozen lost\r\nand bewildered deer having been carefully driven into yards, or barns,\r\nand humanely kept and cared for until they could be shipped to us.\r\nSeveral have been caught while swimming in the Hudson, bewildered and\r\npanic-stricken. The latest capture occurred in New York City itself.\r\n\r\nA puma that escaped (about 1902) from the Zoological Park, instead of\r\nbeing shot was captured by sensible people in the hamlet of Bronxdale,\r\nalive and unhurt, and safely returned to us.\r\n\r\nIn some portions of the east, though not all, the day of the hue and cry\r\nover \"a wild animal in town\" seems to be about over. On Long Island some\r\nhumane persons found an injured turkey vulture, and took it in and cared\r\nfor it,--only to be persecuted by ill-advised game wardens, because they\r\nhad a forbidden wild bird \"in their possession!\" There are times when it\r\nis the highest (moral) duty of a game warden to follow the advice of\r\nPrivate Mulvaney to the \"orficer boy,\" and \"Shut yer oye to the\r\nrigulations, sorr!\"\r\n\r\nSuch occurrences as these are becoming more and more common. _The desire\r\nof \"the great silent majority\" is to SAVE the wild creatures_; and it\r\nis in response to that sentiment that thousands of people are today in\r\nthe field against the Army of Destruction.\r\n\r\nIt is the duty of every sportsman to assist in promoting the passage of\r\na law like our New York law which empowers the State Game Commission to\r\nthrow extra protection around any species that has been slaughtered too\r\nmuch by snow or by firearms, by closing the open season as long as may\r\nbe necessary. Can there be in all America even one thinking, reasoning\r\nbeing who can not see the justice and also the imperative necessity of\r\nthis measure? It seems impossible.\r\n\r\nGive the game the benefit of every doubt! If it becomes too thick, your\r\ngun can quickly thin it out; but if it is once exterminated, it will be\r\nimpossible to bring it back. Be wise; and take thought for the morrow.\r\nRemember the heath hen.\r\n\r\nSLAUGHTER OF BLUEBIRDS.--In the late winter and early spring of 1896 the\r\nwave of bluebirds was caught on its northward migration by a period of\r\nunseasonably cold and fearfully tempestuous weather, involving much\r\nicy-cold rain and sleet. Now, there is no other climatic condition that\r\nis so hard for a wild bird or mammal to withstand as rain at the\r\nfreezing point, and a mantle of ice or frozen snow over all supplies of\r\nfood.\r\n\r\nThe bluebirds perished by thousands. The loss occurred practically all\r\nalong their east-and-west line of migration, from Arkansas to the\r\nAtlantic Coast. In places the species seemed almost exterminated; and it\r\nwas several years ere it recovered to a point even faintly approximating\r\nits original population. I am quite certain that the species never has\r\nrecovered more than 50 per cent of the number that existed previous to\r\nthe calamity.\r\n\r\nDUCK CHOLERA IN THE BRONX RIVER.--In 1911, some unknown but new and\r\nparticularly deadly element, probably introduced in sewage, contaminated\r\nthe waters of Bronx River where it flows through New York City, with\r\nresults very fatal in the Zoological Park. The large flock of mallard\r\nducks, Canada geese, and snow geese on Lake Agassiz was completely wiped\r\nout. In all about 125 waterfowl died in rapid succession, from causes\r\ncommonly classed under the popular name of \"duck cholera.\" The disease\r\nwas carried to other bodies of water in the Park that were fed from\r\nother sources, but made no headway elsewhere than on lakes fed by the\r\npolluted Bronx River.\r\n\r\nFortunately the work of the Bronx River Parkway Commission soon will\r\nterminate the present very unsanitary condition of that stream.\r\n\r\nWILD DUCKS IN DISTRESS.--In the winter of 1911-12, many flocks of wild\r\nducks decided to winter in the North. Many persons believe that this was\r\nlargely due to the prevention of late winter and spring shooting; which\r\nseems reasonable. Unfortunately the winter referred to proved\r\nexceptionally severe and formed vast sheets of thick ice over the\r\nfeeding-grounds where the ducks had expected to obtain their food. On\r\nCayuga, Seneca and other lakes in central New York, and on the island of\r\nMartha's Vineyard, the flocks of ducks suffered very severely, and many\r\nperished of hunger and cold. _But for the laws prohibiting late winter\r\nshooting undoubtedly all of them would have been shot and eaten,\r\nregardless of their distress_.\r\n\r\nGame wardens and humane citizens made numerous efforts to feed the\r\nstarving flocks, and many ducks were saved in that way. An illustrated\r\narticle on the distressed ducks of Keuka Lake, by C. William Beebe and\r\nVerdi Burtch, appeared in the _Zoological Society Bulletin_ for May,\r\n1912. Fortunately there is every reason to believe that such occurrences\r\nwill be rare.\r\n\r\nWILD SWANS SWEPT OVER NIAGARA FALLS.--During the past ten years, several\r\nwinter tragedies to birds have occurred on a large scale at Niagara\r\nFalls. Whole flocks of whistling swans of from 20 up to 70 individuals\r\nalighting in the Niagara River above the rapids have permitted\r\nthemselves to float down into the rapids, and be swept over the Falls,\r\nen masse. On each occasion, the great majority of the birds were\r\ndrowned, or killed on the rocks. Of the very few that survived, few if\r\nany were able to rise and fly out of the gorge below the Falls to\r\nsafety. It is my impression that about 200 swans recently have perished\r\nin this strange way.\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nSLAUGHTER OF SONG-BIRDS BY ITALIANS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn these days of wild-life slaughter, we hear much of death and\r\ndestruction. Before our eyes there continually arise photographs of\r\nhanging masses of waterfowl, grouse, pheasants, deer and fish, usually\r\nsupported in true heraldic fashion by the men who slew them and the\r\nimplements of slaughter. The world has become somewhat hardened to these\r\nthings, because the victims are classed as game; and in the destruction\r\nof game, one game-bag more or less \"Will not count in the news of the\r\nbattle.\"\r\n\r\nThe slaughter of song, insectivorous and all other birds by Italians and\r\nother aliens from southern Europe has become a scourge to the bird life\r\nof this country. The devilish work of the negroes and poor whites of the\r\nSouth will be considered in the next chapter. In Italy, linnets and\r\nsparrows are \"game\"; and so is everything else that wears feathers!\r\nItaly is a continuous slaughtering-ground for the migratory birds of\r\nEurope, and as such it is an international nuisance and a pest. The way\r\npasserine birds are killed and eaten in that country is a disgrace to\r\nthe government of Italy, and a standing reproach to the throne. Even\r\nkings and parliaments have no right in moral or international law to\r\npermit year after year the wholesale slaughter of birds of passage of\r\nspecies that no civilized man has a right to kill.\r\n\r\nThere are some tales of slaughter from which every properly-balanced\r\nChristian mind is bound to recoil with horror. One such tale has\r\nrecently been given to us in the pages of the _Avicultural Magazine_, of\r\nLondon, for January, 1912, by Mr. Hubert D. Astley, F.Z.S., whose word\r\nno man will dispute. In condensing it, let us call it\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nTHE ITALIAN SLAUGHTER OF THE INNOCENTS\r\n\r\nThis story does not concern game birds of any kind. Quite the contrary.\r\nThat it should be published in America, a land now rapidly filling up\r\nwith Italians, is a painful necessity in order that the people of\r\nAmerica may be enabled accurately to measure the fatherland traditions\r\nand the fixed mental attitude of Italians generally toward our song\r\nbirds. I shall now hold a mirror up to Italian nature. If the image is\r\neither hideous or grotesque, the fault will not be mine. I specially\r\ncommend the picture to the notice of American game wardens and judges on\r\nthe bench.\r\n\r\nThe American reader must be reminded that the Italian peninsula reaches\r\nout a long arm of land into the Mediterranean Sea for several hundred\r\nmiles toward the sunny Barbary coast of North Africa. This great\r\nsouthward highway has been chosen by the birds of central Europe as\r\ntheir favorite migration route. Especially is this true of the small\r\nsong-birds with weak wings and a minimum of power for long-sustained\r\nflight. Naturally, they follow the peninsula down to the Italian Land's\r\nEnd before they launch forth to dare the passage of the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN ITALIAN ROCCOLO, ON LAKE COMO\r\nA Death-Trap for Song-Birds. From the Avicultural Magazine]\r\n\r\nItaly is the narrow end of a great continental funnel, into the wide\r\nnorthern end of which Germany, Austria, France and Switzerland annually\r\npour their volume of migratory bird life. And what is the result? For\r\nanswer let us take the testimony of two reliable witnesses, and file it\r\nfor use on the day when Tony Macchewin, gun in hand and pockets bulging\r\nwith cartridges, goes afield in our country and opens fire on our birds.\r\n\r\nThe linnet is one of the sweet singers of Europe. It is a small,\r\ndelicately formed, weak-winged little bird, about the size of our\r\nphoebe-bird. It weighs only a trifle more than a girl's love-letter.\r\nWhere it breeds and rears its young, in Germany for example, a true\r\nsportsman would no more think of shooting a linnet than he would of\r\nkilling and eating his daughter's dearest canary.\r\n\r\nTo the migrating bird, the approach to northern Italy, either going or\r\nreturning, is not through a land of plenty. The sheltering forests have\r\nmostly been swept away, and safe shelters for small birds are very rare.\r\nIn the open, there are owls and hawks; and the only refuge from either\r\nis the thick-leafed grove, into which linnets and pipits can dive at the\r\napproach of danger and quickly hide.\r\n\r\nA linnet from the North after days of dangerous travel finally reached\r\nLake Como, southward bound. The country was much too open for safety,\r\nand its first impulse was to look about for safe shelter. The low bushes\r\nthat sparsely covered the steep hillsides were too thin for refuge in\r\ntimes of sudden danger.\r\n\r\nAh! Upon a hilltop is a little grove of trees, green and inviting. In\r\nthe grove a bird is calling, calling, insistently. The trees are very\r\nsmall; but they seem to stand thickly together, and their foliage should\r\nafford a haven from both hawk and gunner. To it joyously flits the tired\r\nlinnet. As it perches aloft upon a convenient whip-like wand, it notices\r\nfor the first time a queer, square brick tower of small dimensions,\r\nrising in the center of a court-yard surrounded by trees. The tower is\r\nlike an old and dingy turret that has been shorn from a castle, and set\r\non the hilltop without apparent reason. It is two stories in height,\r\nwith one window, dingy and uninviting. A door opens into its base.\r\n\r\nSeveral birds that seem very near, but are invisible, frequently call\r\nand chirp, as if seeking answering calls and companionship. Surely the\r\ngrove must be a safe place for birds, or they would not be here.\r\n\r\nHark! A whirring, whistling sound fills the air, like the air tone of a\r\nflying hawk's wings. A hawk! A hawk!\r\n\r\nDown plunges the scared linnet, blindly, frantically, into the space\r\nsheltered by the grove!\r\n\r\nHorrors! What is this?\r\n\r\nThreads! Invisible, interlacing threads; tangled and full of pockets,\r\ntreacherously spanning the open space. It is a fowler's net! The linnet\r\nis entangled. It flutters frantically but helplessly, and hangs there,\r\ncaught. Its alarm cry is frantically answered by the two strange,\r\ninvisible bird voices that come from the top of the tower!\r\n\r\nThe grove and the tower are A ROCCOLO! A huge, permanent, merciless,\r\ndeadly _trap_, for the wholesale capture of songbirds! The tower is the\r\nhiding place of the fowler, and the calling birds are decoy birds whose\r\neyes have been totally blinded by red-hot wires in order that they will\r\ncall more frantically than birds with eyes would do. The whistling wings\r\nthat seemed a hawk were a sham, made by a racquet thrown through the air\r\nby the fowler, through a slot in his tower. He keeps by him many such\r\nracquets.\r\n\r\nThe door of the tower opens, and out comes the fowler. He is lowbrowed,\r\nswarthy, ill kept, and wears rings in his ears. A soiled hand seizes the\r\nstruggling linnet, and drags it violently from the threads that\r\nentangled it. A sharp-pointed twig is thrust straight through the head\r\nof the helpless victim _at the eyes_, and after one wild, fluttering\r\nagony--it is dead.\r\n\r\nThe fowler sighs contentedly, re-enters his dirty and foul-smelling\r\ntower, tosses the feathered atom upon the pile of dead birds that lies\r\nupon the dirty floor in a dirty corner,--and is ready for the next one.\r\n\r\nAsk him, as did Mr. Astley, and he will tell you frankly that there are\r\nabout 150 dead birds in the pile,--starlings, sparrows, linnets,\r\ngreenfinches, chaffinches, goldfinches, hawfinches, redstarts,\r\nblackcaps, robins, song thrushes, blackbirds, blue and coal tits,\r\nfieldfares and redwings. He will tell you also, that there are _seven\r\nother roccolos within sight and twelve within easy walking distance_. He\r\nwill tell you, as he did Mr. Astley, that during that week he had taken\r\nabout 500 birds, and that that number was a fair average for each of the\r\n12 other roccolos.\r\n\r\nThis means the destruction of about 5,000 songbirds per week _in that\r\nneighborhood alone!_ Another keeper of a roccolo told Mr. Astley that\r\nduring the previous autumn he took about 10,000 birds at his small and\r\ncomparatively insignificant roccolo.\r\n\r\nAnd above that awful roccolo of slaughtered innocents rose _a wooden\r\ncross_, in memory of Christ, the Merciful, the Compassionate!\r\n\r\nAround the interior of the entwined sapling tops that formed the fatal\r\nbower of death there hung a semicircle of tiny cages containing live\r\ndecoys,--chaffinches, hawfinches, titmice and several other species.\r\n\"The older and staider ones call repeatedly,\" says Mr. Astley, \"and the\r\nchaffinches break into song. It is the only song to be heard in Italy at\r\nthe time of the autum migration.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the King of Italy, the Queen of Italy, the Parliament of Italy and\r\nHis Holiness the Pope permit these things, year in and year out. It is\r\nnow said, however, that through the efforts of a recently organized\r\nbird-lovers' society in Italy, the blinding of decoy birds for roccolos\r\nis to be stopped.\r\n\r\nIn Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, the protection of these birds\r\nduring their breeding season must be very effective, for otherwise the\r\nsupply for the Italian slaughter of the Innocents would long ago have\r\nfallen to nothing.\r\n\r\nThe Germans love birds, and all wild life. I wonder how they like the\r\nItalian roccolo. I wonder how France regards it; and whether the nations\r\nof Europe north of Italy will endure this situation forever.\r\n\r\nTo the American and English reader, comment on the practices recorded\r\nabove is quite unnecessary, except the observation that they betoken a\r\ncallousness of feeling and a depth of cruelty and destructiveness to\r\nwhich, so far as known, no savages ever yet have sunk. As an exhibit of\r\nthe groveling pusillanimity of the human soul, the roccolo of northern\r\nItaly reveals minus qualities which can not be expressed either in words\r\nor in figures.\r\n\r\nAnd what is the final exhibit of the gallant knight of the roccolo, the\r\nfeudal lord of the modern castle and its retainers?\r\n\r\nThe answer is given by Dr. Louis B. Bishop, in an article on \"Birds in\r\nthe Markets of Southern Europe.\"\r\n\r\nIn Venice, which was visited in October and November, during the fall\r\nmigration, he found on sale in the markets, as food, thousands of\r\nsongbirds.\r\n\r\n\"Birds were there in profusion, from ducks to kites, in the early\r\nmorning, hung in great bunches above the stalls, but by 9 A.M. most of\r\nthem had been sold. Ducks and shorebirds occurred in some numbers, but\r\nthe vast majority were small sparrows, larks and thrushes. These were\r\nthere during my visit by the thousands, if not ten thousands. To the\r\nmarket they were brought in large sacks, strung in fours on twigs which\r\nhad been passed through the eyes and then tied. Most of these small\r\nbirds had been trapped, and on skinning them I often could find no\r\ninjury except at their eyes.[C] One of these sacks which I examined on\r\nNovember 3, contained hundreds of birds, largely siskins, skylarks and\r\nbramblings. As a rule the small birds that were not sold in the early\r\nmorning were skinned or picked, and their tiny bodies packed in regular\r\norder, breasts up, in shadow tin boxes, and exposed for sale.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote C: It is probable that these birds were killed by piercing the\r\nhead through the eyes.]\r\n\r\n\"During these visits to the Venetian markets, I identified 60 species,\r\nand procured specimens of most. As nearly as I can remember, small birds\r\ncost from two to five cents apiece. For example I paid $2.15 on Nov. 8,\r\nfor\r\n\r\n1 Woodcock,                    1 Skylark,\r\n1 Jay,                         1 Greenfinch,\r\n2 Starlings,                   1 Bullfinch,\r\n2 Spotted Crakes,              1 Redpoll.\r\n1 Song Thrush,                 3 Linnets,\r\n1 Gold-Crest,                  2 Goldfinches,\r\n1 Long-Tailed Titmouse,        6 Siskins,\r\n1 Great Titmouse,              3 Reed Buntings,\r\n1 Pipit,                       3 Bramblings,\r\n1 Redstart,              --and 5 Chaffinches.\r\n\r\n\"On November 10, I paid $3.25 for\r\n\r\n2 Coots,                       1 European Curlew,\r\n1 Water Rail,                  2 Kingfishers,\r\n1 Spotted Crake,               2 Greenfinches,\r\n1 Sparrow Hawk,                2 Wrens,\r\n2 Woodcock,                    2 Great Titmouse,\r\n1 Common Redshank,             2 Blue Titmouse,\r\n1 Dusky Redshank,              1 Redbreast, and\r\n                   2 Dunlins.\"\r\n\r\nOf course there were various species of upland game birds, shore-birds\r\nand waterfowl,--everything, in fact, that could be found and killed. In\r\naddition to the passerine birds listed above. Dr. Bishop noted the\r\nfollowing, all in Venice alone:\r\n\r\nSkylark (\"in great numbers\"),\r\nCrested Lark,                   Crossbill,\r\nCalandra,                       House Sparrow,\r\nTree Sparrow,                   Stonechat,\r\nHawfinch,                       Coal,\r\nYellow-Hammer,                  Goldcrest,\r\nBlackbird,                      Rock Pipit,\r\nFieldfare,                      White Wagtail,\r\nSong Thrush,                    Redwing.\r\n\r\n\"In Florence,\" says Dr. Bishop, \"I visited the central market on\r\nNovember 26, 28, 29, 30, December 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9, and found\r\nbirds even more plentiful than in Venice.\" Besides a variety of game\r\nbirds, he found quantities of the species mentioned above, seen in\r\nVenice, and also the following:\r\n\r\nGreen Sandpiper,                Brown Creeper,\r\nDotterel,                       Nuthatch,\r\nMagpie,                         Black-Cap Warbler,\r\nCorn Bunting,                   Black-Headed Warbler,\r\nMigratory Quail,                Fantail Warbler,\r\nGreen Woodpecker,               Missel Thrush,\r\nSpotted Woodpecker,             Ring Ouzel,\r\nWood Lark,                      Rock Sparrow, and\r\n                Gray Wagtail.\r\n\r\n\"Here, too [at Florence] we saw often, bunches and baskets of small\r\nbirds, chiefly redbreasts, hawked through the streets.... Every Sunday\r\nthat we went into the country we met numbers of Italians out shooting,\r\nand their bags seemed to consist wholly of small birds.\r\n\r\n\"At Genoa, San Remo, Monte Carlo and Nice, between December 13 and 29, I\r\ndid not visit the central markets, if such exist, but saw frequently\r\nbunches of small birds hanging outside stores.... A gentleman who spent\r\nthe fall on an automobile trip through the west of FRANCE _from Brittany\r\nto the Pyrenees, tells me he noticed these bunches of small birds on\r\nsale in every town he visited_.\r\n\r\n\"That killing song-birds for food,\" continues Dr. Bishop, \"is not\r\nconfined to the poor Italians I learned on October 27, when one of the\r\nmost prominent and wealthy Italian _ornithologists_--a delightful\r\nman--told me he had shot 180 skylarks and pipits the day before, and\r\nthat his family liked them far better than other game. Our prejudice\r\nagainst selling game does not exist in Europe, and this same\r\nornithologist told me he often shot 200 ducks in a day at his\r\nshooting-box, sending to the market what he could not use himself. On\r\nNovember 1, 1910, he shot 82 ducks, and on November 8, 103, chiefly\r\nwidgeon and teal.\"\r\n\r\nAn \"ornithologist\" indeed! A \"sportsman\" also, is he not? He belongs\r\nwith his brother \"ornithologists\" of the roccolos, who net their \"game\"\r\nwith the aid of _blind_ birds! Brave men, gallant \"sportsmen,\" are these\r\nmen of Italy,--and western France also if the tale is true!\r\n\r\nIf the people of Europe can stand the wholesale, systematic slaughter of\r\ntheir song and insectivorous birds, _we can_! If they are too\r\nmean-spirited to rise up, make a row about it, and stop it, then let\r\nthem pay the price; but, by the Eternal, Antonio shall not come to this\r\ncountry with the song-bird tastes of the roccolo and indulge them here!\r\n\r\nThe above facts have been cited, not at all for the benefit of Europe,\r\nbut for our own good. The American People are now confronted by the\r\nItalian and Austrian and Hungarian laborer and saloon-keeper and\r\nmechanic, and all Americans should have an exact measure of the\r\nsentiments of southern Europe toward our wild life generally, especially\r\nthe birds that we do not shoot at all, _and therefore are easy to kill_.\r\n\r\nWhen a warden or a citizen arrests an alien for killing any of our\r\nnon-game birds, show the judge these records of how they do things in\r\nItaly, and ask for the extreme penalty.\r\n\r\nI have taken pains to publish the above facts from eye-witnesses in\r\norder that every game commissioner, game warden and state legislator who\r\nreads these pages may know exactly what he is \"up against\" in the alien\r\npopulation of our country from southern Europe. For unnumbered\r\ngenerations, the people of Italy have been taught to believe that it is\r\n_perfectly right_ to shoot and devour every song-bird that flies. The\r\nVenetian is no respecter of species; and when an Italian \"ornithologist\"\r\n(!) can go out and murder 180 linnets and pipits in one day for the pot,\r\nit is time for Americans to think hard.\r\n\r\nWe sincerely hope that it will not require blows and kicks and fines to\r\nremove from Antonio's head the idea that America is not Italy, and that\r\nthe slaughter of song birds \"don't go\" in this country. I strongly\r\nrecommend to every state the enactment of a law that will do these\r\nthings:\r\n\r\n1.--Prohibit the owning, carrying or use of firearms by aliens, and\r\n\r\n2.--Prohibit the use of firearms in hunting by any naturalized alien\r\nfrom southern Europe until after a 10-years' residence in America.\r\n\r\nFrom reports that have come to me at first hand regarding Italians in\r\nthe East, Hungarians in Pennsylvania and Austrians in Minnesota, it\r\nseems absolutely certain that all members of the lower classes of\r\nsouthern Europe are a dangerous menace to our wild life.\r\n\r\nOn account of the now-accursed land-of-liberty idea, every foreigner\r\nwho sails past the statue on Bedloe's Island and lands on our\r\nliberty-ridden shore, is firmly convinced that _now, at last_, he can do\r\nas he pleases! And as one of his first ways in which to show his\r\nnewly-acquired personal liberty and independence in the Land of Easy\r\nMarks, he buys a gun and goes out to shoot \"free game!\"\r\n\r\nIf we, as a people, are so indolent and so somnolent that Antonio gets\r\naway with all our wild birds, then do we deserve to be robbed.\r\n\r\nItalians are pouring into America in a steady stream. They are strong,\r\nprolific, persistent and of tireless energy. New York City now contains\r\n340,000 of them. They work while the native Americans sleep. Wherever\r\nthey settle, their tendency is to root out the native American and take\r\nhis place and his income. Toward wild life the Italian laborer is a\r\nhuman mongoose. Give him power to act, and he will quickly exterminate\r\nevery wild thing that wears feathers or hair. To our songbirds he is\r\nliterally a \"pestilence that walketh at noonday\".\r\n\r\nAs we have shown, the Italian is a born pot-hunter, and he has grown up\r\nin the fixed belief that killing song-birds for food is right! To him\r\nall is game that goes into the bag. The moment he sets foot in the open,\r\nhe provides himself with a shot-gun, and he looks about for things to\r\nkill. It is \"a free country;\" therefore, he may kill anything he can\r\nfind, cook it and eat it. If anybody attempts to check him,--sapristi!\r\nbeware his gun! He cheerfully invades your fields, and even your lawn;\r\nand he shoots robins, bluebirds, thrushes, catbirds, grosbeaks,\r\ntanagers, orioles, woodpeckers, quail, snipe, ducks, crows, and herons.\r\n\r\nDown in Virginia, near Charlottesville, an Italian who was working on a\r\nnew railroad once killed a turkey buzzard; and he selfishly cooked it\r\nand ate it, all alone. A pot-hunting compatriot of his heard of it, and\r\nreproached him for having-dined on game in camera. In the quarrel that\r\nensued, one of the \"sportsmen\" stabbed the other to death.\r\n\r\nWhen the New York Zoological Society began work on its Park in 1899, the\r\nnorthern half of the Borough of the Bronx was a regular daily\r\nhunting-ground for the slaughter of song-birds, and all other birds that\r\ncould be found. Every Sunday it was \"bangetty!\" \"bang!\" from Pelham Bay\r\nto Van Cortlandt. The police force paid not the slightest attention to\r\nthese open, flagrant, shameless violations of the city ordinances and\r\nthe state bird laws. In those days I never but once heard of a policeman\r\n_on his own initiative_ arresting a birdshooter, even on Sunday; but\r\nwhenever meddlesome special wardens from the Zoological Park have\r\npointedly called upon the local police force for help, it has always\r\nbeen given with cheerful alacrity. In the fall of 1912 an appeal to the\r\nPolice Commissioner resulted in a general order to stop all hunting and\r\nshooting in the Borough of the Bronx, and a reform is now on.\r\n\r\nThe war on the bird-killers in New York City began in 1900. It seemed\r\nthat if the Zoological Society did not take up the matter, the slaughter\r\nwould continue indefinitely. The white man's burden was taken up; and\r\nthe story of the war is rather illuminating. Mr. G.O. Shields,\r\nPresident of the League of American Sportsmen, quickly became interested\r\nin the matter, and entered actively into the campaign. For months\r\nunnumbered, he spent every Sunday patroling the woods and thickets of\r\nnorthern New York and Westchester county, usually accompanied by John J.\r\nRose and Rudolph Bell of the Zoological Park force, for whom\r\nappointments as deputy game wardens had been secured from the State.\r\n\r\nThe adventures of that redoubtable trio of man-hunters would make an\r\ninteresting chapter. They were shot at by poachers, but more frequently\r\nthey shot at the other fellows. Just why it was that no one was killed,\r\nno one seems to know. Many Italians and several Americans were arrested\r\nwhile hunting, haled to court, prosecuted and fined. Finally, a reign of\r\nterror set in; and that was the beginning of the end. It became known\r\nthat those three men could not be stopped by threats, and that they\r\nalways got their man--unless he got into a human rabbit-warren of the\r\nItalian boarding-house species. That was the only escape that was\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nThe largest haul of dead birds was 43 robins, orioles, thrushes and\r\nwoodpeckers, captured along with the five Italians who committed the\r\nindiscretion of sitting down in the woods to divide their dead birds. We\r\nsaved all the birds in alcohol, and showed them in court. The judge\r\nfined two of the Italians $50 each, and the other three were sent to the\r\npenitentiary for two months each.\r\n\r\nEven yet, however, at long intervals an occasional son of sunny Italy\r\ntries his luck at Sunday bird shooting; but if anyone yells at him to\r\n\"Halt!\" he throws away his gun and stampedes through the brush like a\r\nfrightened deer. The birds of upper New York are now fairly secure; but\r\nit has taken ten years of fighting to bring it about.\r\n\r\nThroughout New York State, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Connecticut,\r\nMassachusetts, and even Minnesota, wherever there are large settlements\r\nof Italians and Hungarians, the reports are the same. They swarm through\r\nthe country every Sunday, and shoot every wild thing they see. Wherever\r\nthere are large construction works,--railroads, canals or\r\naqueducts,--look for bird slaughter, and you are sure to find it. The\r\nexception to this rule, so far as I know, is along the line of the new\r\nCatskill aqueduct, coming to New York City. The contractors have elected\r\nnot to permit bird slaughter, and the rule has been made that any man\r\nwho goes out hunting will instantly be discharged. That is the best rule\r\nthat ever was made for the protection of birds and game against\r\ngang-working aliens.\r\n\r\nLet every state and province in America look out sharply for the\r\nbird-killing foreigner; for sooner or later, he will surely attack your\r\nwild life. The Italians are spreading, spreading, spreading. If you are\r\nwithout them to-day, to-morrow they will be around you. Meet them at the\r\nthreshold with drastic laws, throughly enforced; for no half way\r\nmeasures will answer.\r\n\r\nPennsylvania has had the worst experience of alien slaughterers of any\r\nstate, thus far. _Six_ of her game wardens have been _killed_, and eight\r\nor ten have been wounded, by shooting! Finally her legislature arose in\r\nwrath, and passed a law prohibiting the ownership or possession of guns\r\nof any kind by aliens. The law gives the right of domiciliary search,\r\nand it surely is enforced. Of course the foreign population \"kicked\"\r\nagainst the law, but the People's steam roller went over them just the\r\nsame. In New York, we require from an alien a license costing $20, and\r\nit has saved a million (perhaps) of our birds; but the Pennsylvania law\r\nis the best. It may be taken as a model for every state and province in\r\nAmerica. Its text is as follows:\r\n\r\n  Section I. Be it enacted, &c., That from and after the passage of\r\n  this act, it shall be unlawful for any unnaturalized foreign-born\r\n  resident to hunt for or capture or kill, in this Commonwealth, any\r\n  wild bird or animal, either game or otherwise, of any description,\r\n  excepting in defense of person or property; and to that end it shall\r\n  be unlawful for any unnaturalized foreign-born resident, within this\r\n  Commonwealth, to either own or be possessed of a shotgun or rifle of\r\n  any make. Each and every person violating any provision of this\r\n  section shall, upon conviction thereof, be sentenced to pay a\r\n  penalty of twenty-five dollars for each offense, or undergo\r\n  imprisonment in the common jail of the county for the period of one\r\n  day for each dollar of penalty imposed. Provided, That in addition\r\n  to the before-named penalty, all guns of the before-mentioned kinds\r\n  found in possession or under control of an unnaturalized\r\n  foreign-born resident shall, upon conviction of such person, or upon\r\n  his signing a declaration of guilt as prescribed by this act, be\r\n  declared forfeited to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and shall be\r\n  sold by the Board of Game Commissioners as hereinafter directed.\r\n\r\n  Section 2. For the purpose of this act, any unnaturalized\r\n  foreign-born person who shall reside or live within the boundaries\r\n  of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for ten consecutive days shall\r\n  be considered a resident and shall be liable to the penalties\r\n  imposed for violation of the provisions of this act.\r\n\r\n  Section 3. That the possession of a shotgun or rifle at any place\r\n  outside of a building, within this Commonwealth, by an unnaturalized\r\n  foreign-born resident, shall be conclusive proof of a violation of\r\n  the provisions of section one of this act, and shall render any\r\n  person convicted thereof liable to the penalty as fixed by said\r\n  section.\r\n\r\n  Section 4. That the presence of a shotgun or rifle in a room or\r\n  house, or building or tent, or camp of any description, within this\r\n  Commonwealth, occupied by or controlled by an unnaturalized\r\n  foreign-born resident shall be prima facie evidence that such gun is\r\n  owned or controlled by the person occupying or controlling the\r\n  property in which such gun is found, and shall render such person\r\n  liable to the penalty imposed by section one of this act.\r\n\r\nOther sections provide for the full enforcement of this law.\r\n\r\nIt is now high time, and an imperative public necessity, that every\r\nstate should act in this matter, before its bird life is suddenly\r\nattacked, and serious inroads made upon it. Do it NOW! The enemy is\r\nheaded your way. Don't wait for him to strike the first blow!\r\n\r\n_Duty of the Italian Press and Clergy_.--Now what is the best remedy for\r\nthe troubles that will arise for Italians in America because of wrong\r\nprinciples established in Italy? It is not in the law, the police, the\r\ncourt and the punishment. It is in _educating the Italian into a\r\nknowledge of the duties of the good citizen_! The Italian press and\r\nclergy can do this; and _no one else can do it so easily, so quickly and\r\nso well_!\r\n\r\nThose two powerful forces should enter seriously upon this task. In\r\nevery other respect, the naturalized Italian tries to become a good\r\ncitizen, and adjust himself to the laws and the customs of his new\r\ncountry. Why should he not do this in regard to bird life? It is not too\r\nmuch to ask, nor is it too much to _exact_. Does the Italian workman, or\r\nstore-keeper who makes his living by honest toil _enjoy_ breaking our\r\nbird laws, _enjoy_ irritating and injuring those with whom he has come\r\nto live? Does he _enjoy_ being watched, and searched, and chased, and\r\narrested,--all for a few small birds that he _does not need_ for food?\r\nHe earns good wages; he has plenty of good food; and he must be\r\n_educated_ into protecting our birds instead of destroying them. The\r\nItalian newspapers and clergy have a serious duty to perform in this\r\nmatter, and we hope they will diligently discharge it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DEAD SONG-BIRDS\r\nThese jars contain the dead bodies of 43 valuable insectivorous birds\r\nthat were taken from two Italians in October, 1905, in the suburbs of\r\nNew York City, by game wardens of the New York Zoological Society.]\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n\r\nDESTRUCTION OF SONG BIRDS BY SOUTHERN NEGROES AND POOR WHITES\r\n\r\nBefore going farther, there is one point that I wish to make quite\r\nclear.\r\n\r\nWhenever the people of a particular race make a specialty of some\r\nparticular type of wrong-doing, anyone who pointedly rebukes the faulty\r\nmembers of that race is immediately accused of \"race prejudice.\" On\r\naccount of the facts I am now setting forth about the doings of Italian\r\nand negro bird-killers, I expect to be accused along that line. If I am,\r\nI shall strenuously deny the charge. The facts speak for themselves.\r\nZoologically, however, I am strongly prejudiced against the people of\r\nany race, creed, club, state or nation who make a specialty of any\r\nparticularly offensive type of bird or wild animal slaughter; and I do\r\nnot care who knows it.\r\n\r\nThe time was, and I remember it very well, when even the poorest gunner\r\nscorned to kill birds that were not considered \"game.\" In days lang\r\nsyne, many a zoological collector has been jeered because the specimens\r\nhe had killed for preservation were not \"game.\"\r\n\r\nBut times have changed. In the wearing of furs, we have bumped down\r\nsteps both high and steep. In 1880 American women wore sealskin, marten,\r\notter, beaver and mink. To-day nothing that wears hair is too humble to\r\nbe skinned and worn. To-day \"they are wearing\" skins of muskrats, foxes,\r\nrabbits, skunks, domestic cats, squirrels, and even rats. And see how\r\nthe taste for game,--of some sections of our population,--also has gone\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nIn the North, the Italians are fighting for the privilege of eating\r\neverything that wears feathers; but we allow no birds to be shot for\r\nfood save game birds and cranes. In the South, the negroes and poor\r\nwhites are killing song-birds, woodpeckers and doves for food; and in\r\nseveral states some of it is done under the authority of the laws. Look\r\nat these awful lists:\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nIN THESE STATES, ROBINS ARE LEGALLY SHOT AND EATEN:\r\n\r\nLouisiana    North Carolina   Tennessee  Texas\r\nMississippi  South Carolina   Maryland   Florida\r\n\r\nIN THESE STATES, BLACKBIRDS ARE LEGALLY SHOT AND EATEN:\r\n\r\nLouisiana    Pennsylvania        Tennessee\r\nDistrict of Columbia    South Carolina\r\n\r\nCRANES ARE SHOT AND EATEN IN THESE STATES:\r\n\r\nColorado    North Dakota    Nevada    Oklahoma    Nebraska\r\n\r\nIn Mississippi, the _cedar bird_ is legally shot and eaten! In North\r\nCarolina, the meadow lark is shot and eaten.\r\n\r\nIN THE FOLLOWING STATES, DOVES ARE CONSIDERED \"GAME,\" AND ARE SHOT IN AN\r\n\"OPEN SEASON:\"\r\n\r\nAlabama            Georgia    Minnesota        Ohio\r\nArkansas           Idaho      Mississippi      Oregon\r\nCalifornia         Illinois   Missouri         Pennsylvania\r\nConnecticut        Kentucky   Nebraska         South Carolina\r\nDelaware           Louisiana  New Mexico       Tennessee\r\nDist. of Columbia  Maryland   North Carolina   Texas\r\n               Utah                       Virginia\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nThe killing of doves represents a great and widespread decline in the\r\nethics of sportsmanship. In the twenty-six States named, a great many\r\nmen who _call_ themselves sportsmen indulge in the cheap and ignoble\r\npastime of potting weak and confiding doves. It is on a par with the\r\n\"sport\" of hunting English sparrows in a city street. Of course this is,\r\nto a certain extent, a matter of taste; but there is at least one club\r\nof sportsmen into which no dove-killer can enter, provided his standard\r\nof ethics is known in advance.\r\n\r\nWith the killing of robins, larks, blackbirds and cedar birds for food,\r\nthe case is quite different. No white man calling himself a sportsman\r\never indulges in such low pastimes as the killing of such birds for\r\nfood. That burden of disgrace rests upon the negroes and poor whites of\r\nthe South; but at the same time, it is a shame that respectable white\r\nmen sitting in state legislatures should deliberately enact laws\r\n_permitting_ such disgraceful practices, or permit such disgraceful and\r\nungentlemanly laws to remain in force!\r\n\r\nHere is a case by way of illustration, copied very recently from the\r\nAtlanta _Journal_:\r\n\r\n  Editor _Journal_:--I located a robin roost up the Trinity River, six\r\n  miles from Dallas, and prevailed on six Dallas sportsmen to go with\r\n  me on a torch-light bird hunt. This style of hunting was, of course,\r\n  new to the Texans, but they finally consented to go, and I had the\r\n  pleasure of showing them how it was done.\r\n\r\n  Equipped with torch lights and shot guns, we proceeded. After\r\n  reaching the hunting grounds the sport began in reality, and\r\n  continued for two hours and ten minutes, with a total slaughter of\r\n  10,157 birds, an average of 1,451 birds killed by each man.\r\n\r\n  But the Texans give me credit for killing at least 2,000 of the\r\n  entire number. I was called 'the king of bird hunters' by the\r\n  sportsmen of Dallas, Texas, and have been invited to\r\n  command-in-chief the next party of hunters which go from Dallas to\r\n  the Indian Territory in search of large game.--F.L. CROW, Dallas,\r\n  Texas, former Atlantan.\r\n\r\nDallas, Texas, papers and Oklahoma papers, please copy!\r\n\r\nAs a further illustration of the spirit manifested in the South toward\r\nrobins, I quote the following story from Dr. P.P. Claxton, of the\r\nUniversity of Tennessee, as related in Audubon Educational Leaflet No.\r\n46, by Mr. T. Gilbert Pearson:--\r\n\r\n\"The roost to which I refer,\" says Professor Claxton, \"was situated in\r\nwhat is locally known as a 'cedar glade,' near Porestville, Bedford Co.,\r\nTennessee. This is a great cedar country, and robins used to come in\r\nimmense numbers during the winter months, to feed on the berries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ROBIN OF THE NORTH\r\nOur best-beloved Song Bird, now being legally shot as \"game\" in the\r\nSouth. In the North there is now only one robin for every ten formerly\r\nthere.]\r\n\r\n\"The spot which the roost occupied was not unlike numerous others that\r\nmight have been selected. The trees grew to a height of from five to\r\nthirty feet, and for a mile square were literally loaded at night with\r\nrobins. Hunting them while they roosted was a favorite sport. A man\r\nwould climb a cedar tree with a torch, while his companions with poles\r\nand clubs would disturb the sleeping birds on the adjacent trees.\r\nBlinded by the light, the suddenly awakened birds flew to the\r\ntorch-bearer; who, _as he seized each bird would quickly pull off its\r\nhead_, and drop it into a sack suspended from his shoulders.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MOCKING-BIRD OF THE SOUTH\r\nThis sweet singer of the South is NOT being shot in the North\r\nfor food! No northern lawmaker ever will permit such barbarity.]\r\n\r\n\"The capture of three of four hundred birds was an ordinary night's\r\nwork. Men and boys would come in wagons from all the adjoining counties\r\nand camp near the roost for the purpose of killing robins. Many times,\r\n100 or more hunters with torches and clubs would be at work in a single\r\nnight. _For three years_ this tremendous slaughter continued in\r\nwinter,--and then the survivors deserted the roost.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NORTHERN ROBINS READY FOR SOUTHERN SLAUGHTER\r\n195 Birds at Avery Island, La. in January 1912, Photographed Daring the\r\nAnnual Slaughter, by E.A. McIlhenny]\r\n\r\nNo: these people were not Apache Indians, led by a Geronimo who knew no\r\nmercy, no compassion. We imagine that they were mostly poor white trash,\r\nof Tennessee. One small hamlet sent to market annually enough dead\r\nrobins to return $500 at _five cents per dozen_; which means _120,000\r\nbirds_!\r\n\r\nLast winter Mr. Edward A. McIlhenny of Avery Island, La. (south of New\r\nIberia) informed me that every winter, during the two weeks that the\r\nholly berries are ripe thousands of robins come to his vicinity to feed\r\nupon them. \"Then every negro man and boy who can raise a gun is after\r\nthem. About 10,000 robins are slaughtered each day while they remain.\r\nTheir dead bodies are sold in New Iberia at 10 cents each.\" The\r\naccompanying illustrations taken by Mr. McIlhenny shows 195 robins on\r\none tree, and explains how such great slaughter is possible.\r\n\r\nAn officer of the Louisiana Audubon Society states that a conservative\r\nestimate of the number of robins annually killed in Louisiana for food\r\npurposes when they are usually plentiful, is a _quarter of a million_!\r\n\r\nThe food of the robin is as follows:\r\n\r\nInsects, 40 per cent; wild fruit, 43 per cent; cultivated fruit, 8 per\r\ncent, miscellaneous vegetable food, 5 per cent.\r\n\r\nSPECIAL WORK OF THE SOUTHERN NEGROES.--In 1912 a female colored servant\r\nwho recently had arrived from country life in Virginia chanced to remark\r\nto me at our country home in the middle of August: \"I wish I could find\r\nsome birds' nests!\"\r\n\r\n\"What for?\" I asked, rather puzzled.\r\n\r\n\"Why, to get the aigs and _eat 'em!_\" she responded with a bright smile\r\nand flashing teeth.\r\n\r\n\"Do you eat the eggs of _wild_ birds?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes indeed! It's _fine_ to get a pattridge nest! From them we nearly\r\nalways git a whole dozen of aigs at once,--back where I live, in\r\nVirginia.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do the colored people of Virginia make a _practice_ of hunting for the\r\neggs of wild birds, and eating them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, indeed we do. In the spring and summer, when the birds are around,\r\nwe used to get out every Sunday, and hunt all day. Some days we'd come\r\nback with a whole bucket full of aigs; and then we'd set up half the\r\nnight, cookin' and eatin' 'em. They was _awful_ good!\"\r\n\r\nHer face fairly beamed at the memory of it.\r\n\r\nA few days later, this story of the doings of Virginia negroes was fully\r\ncorroborated by a colored man who came from another section of that\r\nstate. Three months later, after special inquiries made at my request, a\r\ngentleman of Richmond obtained further corroboration, from negroes. He\r\nwas himself much surprised by the state of fact that was revealed to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nIn the North, the economic value of our song birds and other destroyers\r\nof insects and weed seeds is understood by a majority of the people, and\r\nas far as possible those birds are protected from all human enemies. But\r\nin the South, a new division of the Army of Destruction has risen into\r\ndeadly prominence.\r\n\r\nIn _Recreation_ Magazine for May, 1909, Mr. Charles Askins published a\r\nmost startling and illuminating article, entitled \"The South's Problem\r\nin Game Protection.\" It brought together in concrete form and with\r\neye-witness reliability the impressions that for months previous had\r\nbeen gaining ground in the North. In order to give the testimony of a\r\nman who has seen what he describes, I shall now give numerous quotations\r\nfrom Mr. Askins' article, which certainly bears the stamp of\r\ntruthfulness, without any \"race prejudice\" whatever. It is a calm,\r\njudicial, unemotional analysis of a very bad situation: and I\r\nparticularly commend it alike to the farmers of the North and all the\r\ntrue sportsmen of the South.\r\n\r\nIn his opening paragraphs Mr. Askins describes game and hunting\r\nconditions in the South as they were down to twenty years ago, when the\r\nnegroes were too poor to own guns, and shooting was not for them.\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nSPECIAL WORK OF THE SOUTHERN NEGROES.\r\n\r\n  It is all different now, says Mr. Askins, and the old days will only\r\n  come back with the water that has gone down the stream. The master\r\n  is with his fathers or he is whiling away his last days on the\r\n  courthouse steps of the town. Perhaps a chimney or two remain of\r\n  what was once the \"big house\" on the hill; possibly it is still\r\n  standing, but as forlorn and lifeless as a dead tree. The muscadine\r\n  grapes still grow in the swale and the persimmons in the pasture\r\n  field, but neither 'possum nor 'coon is left to eat them. The last\r\n  deer vanished years ago, the rabbits died in their baby coats and\r\n  the quail were killed in June. Old \"Uncle Ike\" has gone across the\r\n  \"Great River\" with his master, and his grandson glances at you\r\n  askance, nods sullenly, whistles to his half breed bird dog,\r\n  shoulders his three dollar gun and leaves you. He is typical of the\r\n  change and has caused it, this grandson of dear old Uncle Ike.\r\n\r\n  In the same way the white man is telling the black to abide upon the\r\n  plantation raising cotton and corn, and further than this nothing\r\n  will be required of him. He can cheat a white man or a black, steal\r\n  in a petty way anything that comes handy, live in marriage or out of\r\n  it to please himself, kill another negro if he likes, and lastly\r\n  shoot every wild thing that can be eaten, if only he raises the\r\n  cotton and the corn. But the white sportsmen of the South have never\r\n  willingly granted the shooting privilege in its entirety, and hence\r\n  this story. They have told him to trap the rabbits, pot the robins,\r\n  slaughter the doves, kill the song birds, but to spare the white\r\n  sportsman's game, the aristocratic little bobwhite quail.\r\n\r\n  In the beginning not so much damage to southern game interests could\r\n  be accomplished by our colored man and brother, however decided his\r\n  inclinations. He had no money, no ammunition and no gun. His weapons\r\n  were an ax, a club, a trap, and a hound dog; possibly he might own\r\n  an old war musket bored out for shot. Such an outfit was not adapted\r\n  to quail shooting and especially to wing shooting, with which\r\n  knowledge Dixie's sportsmen were content. Let the negro ramble about\r\n  with his hound dog and his war musket; he couldn't possibly kill the\r\n  quail. And so Uncle Ike's grandson loafed and pottered about in the\r\n  fields with his ax and his hound dogs, not doing so much harm to the\r\n  quail but acquiring knowledge of the habits of the birds and skill\r\n  as a still-hunting pot-hunter that would serve him well later on.\r\n  The negro belongs to a primitive race of people and all such races\r\n  have keener eyes than white men whose fathers have pored over lines\r\n  of black and white. He learned to see the rabbit in its form, the\r\n  squirrels in the leafy trees, and the quails huddled in the grass.\r\n  The least shade of gray in the shadow of the creek bank he\r\n  distinguished at once as a rabbit, a glinting flash from a tree top\r\n  he knew instantly as being caused by the slight movement of a hidden\r\n  squirrel, and the quiver of a single stem of sedge grass told him of\r\n  a bevy of birds hiding in the depths. The pot-hunting negro has all\r\n  the skill of the Indian, has more industry in his loafing, and kills\r\n  without pity and without restraint. This grandson of Uncle Ike was\r\n  growing sulky, too, with the knowledge that the white man was\r\n  bribing him with half a loaf to raise cotton and corn when he might\r\n  as well exact it all. And this he shortly did, as we shall see.\r\n\r\n  The time came when cotton went up to sixteen cents a pound and\r\n  single breech-loading guns went down to five dollars apiece. The\r\n  negro had money now, and the merchants--these men who had said let\r\n  the nigger alone so long as he raises cotton and corn--sold him the\r\n  guns, a gun for every black idler, man and boy, in all the South.\r\n  Then shortly a wail went up from the sportsmen, \"The niggers are\r\n  killing our quail.\" They not only were killing them, but most of the\r\n  birds were already dead. On the grounds of the Southern Field Club\r\n  where sixty bevies were raised by the dogs in one day, within two\r\n  years but three bevies could be found in a day by the hardest kind\r\n  of hunting; and this story was repeated all over the South. Now the\r\n  negro began to raise bird dogs in place of hounds, and he carried\r\n  his new gun to church if services happened to be held on a week day.\r\n  Finally the negro had grown up and had compassed his ambition: he\r\n  could shoot partridges flying just the same as a white man, was a\r\n  white man except for a trifling difference in color; and he could\r\n  kill more birds, too, three times as many. It was merely a change\r\n  from the old order to the new in which a dark-skinned \"sportsman\"\r\n  had taken the place in plantation life of the dear old \"Colonel\" of\r\n  loved memory. The negro had exacted his price for raising cotton and\r\n  corn.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SOUTHERN-NEGRO METHOD OF COMBING OUT THE WILD LIFE\r\n\"Our colored sportsman is gregarious at all times, but especially so in\r\nthe matter of recreation. He may slouch about alone, and pot a bevy or\r\ntwo of quail when in actual need of something to eat, or when he has a\r\nsale for the birds, but when it comes to shooting for fun he wants to be\r\nwith the 'gang'.\"--Charles Askins.\r\nReproduced from Recreation Magazine. By permission of the Outdoor World.]\r\n\r\n  Our colored sportsman is gregarious at all times, but especially so\r\n  in the matter of recreation. He may slouch about alone and pot a\r\n  bevy or two of quail when in actual need of something to eat, or\r\n  when he has a sale for the birds, but when it comes to shooting for\r\n  fun he wants to be with the \"gang.\" I have seen the darkies at\r\n  Christmas time collect fifty in a drove with every man his dog, and\r\n  spread out over the fields. Such a glorious time as he has then! A\r\n  single cottontail will draw a half-dozen shots and perhaps a couple\r\n  of young bucks will pour loads into a bunny after he is dead out of\r\n  pure deviltry and high spirits. I once witnessed the accidental\r\n  killing of a young negro on this kind of a foray. His companions\r\n  loaded him into a wagon, stuck a cigar in his mouth, and tried to\r\n  pour whiskey down him every time they took a drink themselves as\r\n  they rode back to town. This army of black hunters and their dogs\r\n  cross field after field, combing the country with fine teeth that\r\n  leave neither wild animal nor bird life behind.\r\n\r\n  There comes a time toward the spring of the year after the quail\r\n  season is over when the average rural darky is \"between hay and\r\n  grass.\" The merchants on whom he has depended for supplies make it a\r\n  practice to refuse credit between January first and crop time. The\r\n  black has spent his cotton money, his sweet potato pile has\r\n  vanished, the sorghum barrel is empty, he has eaten the last of his\r\n  winter's pork, and all that remains is a bit of meal and the meat\r\n  his gun can secure. He is hunting in grim earnest now, using all the\r\n  cunning and skill acquired by years of practice. He eats\r\n  woodpeckers, jaybirds, hawks and skunks, drawing the line only at\r\n  crows and buzzards. At this season of the year I have carried\r\n  chicken hawks up to the cabins for the sake of watching the delight\r\n  of the piccaninnies who with glowing eyes would declare, \"Them's\r\n  mos' as good as chicken.\" What happens to the robins, doves, larks,\r\n  red birds, mocking birds and all songsters in this hungry season\r\n  needs hardly to be stated.\r\n\r\n  It is also a time between hay and grass for the rabbits and the\r\n  quail. The corn fields are bare and the weed seeds are exhausted. A\r\n  spring cold spell pinches, they lose their vitality, become thin and\r\n  quite lack their ordinary wariness. Then the figure-four trap\r\n  springs up in the hedgerow and the sedge while the work of\r\n  decimation goes more rapidly along. The rabbits can no longer escape\r\n  the half-starved dogs, the thinning cover fails to hide the quail\r\n  and the song birds betray themselves by singing of the coming\r\n  spring.\r\n\r\n  With the growing scarcity of the game now comes the season of sedge\r\n  and field burning. This is done ostensibly to prepare the land for\r\n  spring plowing, but really to destroy the last refuge of the quail\r\n  and rabbits so that they can be bagged with certainty. All the\r\n  negroes of a neighborhood collect for one of these burnings, all\r\n  their dogs, and of course all the boys from six years old up. They\r\n  surround the field and set it on fire in many places, leaving small\r\n  openings for the game to dash out among the motley assembly. I have\r\n  seen quail fly out of the burning grass with flaming particles still\r\n  attached to them. They alight on the burnt ground too bewildered to\r\n  fly again and the boys and dogs pick them up. Crazed rabbits try the\r\n  gauntlet amidst the barking curs, shouting negroes and popping guns,\r\n  but death is sure and quick. The few quail that may escape have no\r\n  refuge from the hawks and nothing to eat, so every battue of this\r\n  kind marks the absolute end of the birds in one vicinity; and the\r\n  next day the darkies repeat the performance elsewhere.\r\n\r\n  At this season of the year, the first of May, the blacks are putting\r\n  in some of their one hundred working days while the single\r\n  breech-loader rusts in the chimney corner. Surely the few birds that\r\n  have escaped the foray of the \"gang,\" lived through the hungry days,\r\n  and survived their burned homes can now call \"Bob White\" and mate in\r\n  peace. But school is out and the summer sun is putting new life into\r\n  the bare feet of the half-grown boys, and the halfbreed bird dogs\r\n  are busier than they were even in winter. The young rabbits are\r\n  killed before they get out of the nest, and the quail eggs must be\r\n  hidden rarely well that escape both the eyes of the boys and the\r\n  noses of the dogs. After all it is not surprising that but three\r\n  bevies remained of the sixty. Doubtless they would not, except that\r\n  nature is very kind to her own in the sunny South.\r\n\r\n  Not every white man in the South is a sportsman or even a shooter;\r\n  many are purely business men who have said let the \"nigger\" do as he\r\n  likes so long as he raises cotton and buys our goods. But Dixie has\r\n  her full share of true men of the out-of-doors and they have sworn\r\n  in downright Southern fashion that this thing has got to end.\r\n  Nevertheless their problem is deep and puzzling. In Alabama they\r\n  made an effort and a beginning. They asked for a law requiring every\r\n  man to obtain written permission before entering the lands of\r\n  another to hunt and shoot; they asked for a resident license law\r\n  taxing every gun not less than five dollars a year; for a shortened\r\n  season, a bag limit, and a complete system of State wardens.\r\n  Unfortunately, a lot of white farmers were in the same range as the\r\n  blacks, and being hit, too, they raised a great outcry. The result\r\n  was that the Alabama sportsmen got everything they asked for except\r\n  the foundation of the structure they were trying to build, the high\r\n  resident license or gun tax which alone could have shut out three\r\n  dollar guns and saved the remnant of the game. Under the new law the\r\n  sale of game was forbidden, neither could it be shipped out of the\r\n  State alive or dead; the ever popular non-resident license was\r\n  provided for; the season was shortened and the bag limited; the\r\n  office of State game warden was created with deputies to be paid\r\n  from fines; hunting upon the lands of another without written\r\n  permission became a misdemeanor; and then the whole thing was\r\n  nullified by reducing the resident license to nothing where a man\r\n  shot upon his own land, one dollar in his own county, and two\r\n  dollars outside of it. In its practical workings the new law amounts\r\n  to this: A few northern gunners have paid the non-resident license\r\n  fee, and enough resident licenses have been taken out by the city\r\n  sportsmen to make up the handsome salary of the State warden. The\r\n  negro still hunts upon his own land _or upon the land of the man who\r\n  wants corn and cotton raised_, with perfect indifference to the\r\n  whole thing. Who was to enforce the law against him? Not the one\r\n  disgusted deputy with three big counties to patrol who depended for\r\n  his salary upon the fines collected from the negroes. It would take\r\n  one man to every three miles square to protect the game in the\r\n  South.\r\n\r\n  The one effective way of dealing with the situation in Alabama was\r\n  to have legislated three dollar guns out of existence with a five\r\n  dollar tax, adding to this nearly a like amount on dogs. Hardly a\r\n  sportsman in the South will disagree with this conclusion. But\r\n  sportsmen never had a majority vote either in the South or in the\r\n  North, and the South's grave problem is yet unsolved.\r\n\r\n  I do not favor depriving the black man of his natural human right to\r\n  hunt and shoot. If he is the owner of land, or if he leases or rents\r\n  it, or if he does not, he should have exactly the same privilege of\r\n  hunting that the white man has. That is not the question now,\r\n  however, but how to restrict him to legal shooting, to make him\r\n  amenable to the law that governs the white man, to deprive him of\r\n  the absolute license he now enjoys to kill throughout the year\r\n  without mercy, without discrimination, without restraint. If only\r\n  for selfish reasons, we of the North should reach to southern\r\n  sportsmen a helping hand, for by and by the last of our migratory\r\n  song birds will go down into Dixie and never return.\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nMr. Askins has fairly stated a profoundly disturbing case. The remedy\r\nmust contain at least three ingredients. The sportsmen of the South must\r\nstop the unjustifiable slaughter of their non-migratory game birds. As a\r\nmatter of comity between states, the gentlemen of the South must pass\r\nlaws to stop the killing of northern song-birds and all crop-protecting\r\nbirds, for food. Finally, all men, North and South, East and West, must\r\nunite in the work that is necessary to secure the immediate enactment by\r\nCongress of a law for the federal protection of all migratory birds.\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nEXTERMINATION OF BIRDS FOR WOMEN'S HATS[D]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote D: In the preparation of this chapter and its illustrations, I\r\nhave had much valuable assistance from Mr. C. William Beebe, who\r\nrecently has probed the London feather trade almost to the bottom.]\r\n\r\nIt is high time for the whole civilized world to know that many of the\r\nmost beautiful and remarkable birds of the world are now being\r\n_exterminated_ to furnish millinery ornaments for women's wear. The mass\r\nof new information that we have recently secured on this traffic from\r\nthe headquarters of the feather trade is appalling. Previously, I had\r\nnot dreamed that conditions are half as bad as they are.\r\n\r\nIt is entirely fitting that on this subject New York should send a\r\nmessage to London. New York is almost a Spotless Town in plume-free\r\nmillinery, and London and Paris are the worst places in the world. We\r\nhave cleaned house. With but extremely slight exceptions, the blood of\r\nthe slaughtered innocents is no longer upon our skirts, and on the\r\nsubject of plumage millinery we have a right to be just as Pharisaical\r\nas we choose.\r\n\r\nHere in New York (and also in New Jersey) no man may sell, own for sale\r\nor offer for sale the plumage of any wild American bird other than a\r\ngame bird. More than that, the plumage of no foreign bird belonging to\r\nany bird family represented in the fauna of North America can be sold\r\nhere! There are only a few kinds of improper \"millinery\" feathers that\r\nit is possible to sell here under the law. Thanks to the long and\r\narduous campaign of the National Association of Audubon Societies,\r\nfounded and for ten years directed by gallant William Dutcher, you now\r\nsee on the streets of New York very, very little wild-bird plumage save\r\nthat from game birds.\r\n\r\nIt is true that a few servant girls are now wearing the cast-off\r\naigrettes of their mistresses; but they are only as one in a thousand.\r\nAt Atlantic City there is said to be a fine display of servant-girl and\r\nladies-maid aigrettes. In New York and New Jersey, in Pennsylvania for\r\neverything save the sale of heron and egret plumes (a privilege obtained\r\nby a bunko game), in Massachusetts, and in many other of our States, the\r\nwild-birds'-plumage millinery business is dead. Two years ago, when the\r\nNew York legislature refused to repeal the Dutcher law, the Millinery\r\nAssociation asserted, and brought a cloud of witnesses to Albany to\r\nprove, that the enforcement of the law would throw thousands of\r\noperatives out of employment.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BEAUTIFUL AND CURIOUS BIRDS NOW BEING DESTROYED\r\nFOR THE FEATHER TRADE--(I)\r\nBelted Kingfisher\r\nVictoria Crowned Pigeon\r\nSuperb Calliste\r\nGreater Bird of Paradise\r\nCommon Tern\r\nCock of the Rock]\r\n\r\nThe law is in effect; and the aigrette business is dead in this state.\r\nHave any operatives starved, or been thrown out of employment? We have\r\nheard of none. They are now at work making very pretty hat ornaments of\r\nsilk and ribbons, and gauze and lace; and \"_They_ are wearing them.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 1600 HUMMINGBIRD SKINS AT 2 CENTS EACH!\r\nPart of Lot Purchased by the Zoological Society at the Regular Quarterly\r\nLondon Millinery Feather Sale, August, 1912.]\r\n\r\nBut even while these words are being written, there is one large fly in\r\nthe ointment. The store-window of E. &. S. Meyers, 688 Broadway, New\r\nYork, contains about _six hundred plumes and skins of birds of paradise\r\nfor sale for millinery purposes_. No wonder the great bird of paradise\r\nis now almost extinct! Their sale here is possible because the Dutcher\r\nlaw protects from the feather dealers only the birds that belong to\r\navian families represented in the United States. With fiendish cunning\r\nand enterprise, the shameless feather dealers are ferreting out the\r\nbirds whose skins and plumes may legally be imported into this country\r\nand sold; but we will meet that with a law that will protect all\r\nforeign birds, so far as we are concerned. Now it is time for the\r\nuniversal enactment of a law which will prohibit the sale and use as\r\nornaments of the plumage, feathers or skins of _any_ wild bird that is\r\nnot a legitimate game bird.\r\n\r\nLondon is now the head of the giant octopus of the \"feather trade\" that\r\nhas reached out its deadly tentacles into the most remote wildernesses\r\nof the earth, and steadily is drawing in the \"skins\" and \"plumes\" and\r\n\"quills\" of the most beautiful and most interesting _unprotected_ birds\r\nof the world. The extent of this cold-blooded industry, supported by\r\nvain and hard-hearted women, will presently be shown in detail. Paris is\r\nthe great manufacturing center of feather trimming and ornaments, and\r\nthe French people obstinately refuse to protect the birds from\r\nextermination, because their slaughter affords employment to a certain\r\nnumbers of French factory operatives.\r\n\r\nAll over the world where they have real estate possessions, the men of\r\nEngland know how to protect game from extermination. The English are\r\ngood at protecting game--when they decide to set about it.\r\n\r\nWhy should London be the Mecca of the feather-killers of the world?\r\n\r\nIt is easily explained:\r\n\r\n(1) London has the greatest feather market in the world; (2) the feather\r\nindustry \"wants the money\"; and (3) the London feather industry is\r\nwilling to spend money in fighting to retain its strangle-hold on the\r\nunprotected birds of the world.\r\n\r\nLet us run through a small portion of the mass of fresh evidence before\r\nus. It will be easier for the friends of birds to read these details\r\nhere than to procure them at first hand, as we have done.\r\n\r\nThe first thing that strikes one is the fact that the feather-hunters\r\nare scattered _all over the world where bird life is plentiful_ and\r\nthere are no laws to hinder their work. I commend to every friend of\r\nbirds this list of the species whose plumage is to-day being bought and\r\nsold in large quantities every year in London. To the birds of the world\r\nthis list is of deadly import, for it spells extermination.\r\n\r\nThe reader will notice that it is the way of the millinery octopus to\r\nreach out to the uttermost ends of the earth, and take everything that\r\nit can use. From the trackless jungles of New Guinea, round the world\r\nboth ways to the snow-capped peaks of the Andes, no unprotected bird is\r\nsafe. The humming-birds of Brazil, the egrets of the world at large, the\r\nrare birds of paradise, the toucan, the eagle, the condor and the emu,\r\nall are being _exterminated_ to swell the annual profits of the\r\nmillinery trade. The case is _far_ more serious than the world at large\r\nknows, or even suspects. But for the profits, the birds would be safe;\r\nand no unprotected wild species can long escape the hounds of Commerce.\r\n\r\nBut behold the list of rare, curious and beautiful birds that are today\r\nin grave peril:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BEAUTIFUL AND CURIOUS BIRDS NOW BEING DESTROYED\r\nFOR THE FEATHER TRADE--(II)\r\nLyre Bird\r\nWhite Ibis\r\nGolden Eagle\r\nResplendent Trogan\r\nSilver Pheasant\r\nToco Toucan]\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nLIST OF BIRDS NOW BEING EXTERMINATED FOR THE LONDON AND CONTINENTAL\r\nFEATHER MARKETS:\r\n\r\n_Species_.                        _Locality._\r\nAmerican Egret                  Venezuela, S.

As one item, let us take the sales\r\nin London in February, May and October, 1911, because they bring the\r\nsubject well down to date. My agent's explanatory note is as follows:\r\n\r\n\"These three sales represent six months. Very nearly double this\r\nquantity is sold by these four firms in a year. We must also take into\r\nconsideration that all the feathers are not brought to the London\r\nmarket, and that _very large shipments are also made direct to the\r\nraw-feather dealers and manufacturers of Paris and Berlin, and that\r\nAmsterdam also gets large quantities from the West Indies_. For your\r\npurpose, I report upon three sales, at different periods of the year\r\n1911, and as those sales do not vary much, you will be able to judge the\r\nconsumption of birds in a year.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"aigrettes\" of the feather trade come from egrets, and, being very\r\nlight, it requires the death of several birds to yield one ounce. In\r\nmany catalogues, the word \"albatross\" stands for the jabiru, a\r\nnearly-exterminated species of giant stork, inhabiting South America.\r\n\"Rhea\" often stands for vulture plumage.\r\n\r\nIf the feather dealers had deliberately attempted to form an educational\r\nlist of the most beautiful and the most interesting birds of the world,\r\nthey could hardly have done better than they have done in the above\r\nlist. If it were in my power to show the reader a colored plate of each\r\nspecies now being exterminated by the feather trade, he would be\r\nstartled by the exhibit. That the very choicest birds of the whole avian\r\nworld should be thus blotted out at the behest of vain and heartless\r\nwomen is a shame, a disgrace and world-wide loss.\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nLONDON FEATHER SALE OF FEBRUARY, 1911\r\n\r\n_Sold by Hale & Sons            Sold by Dalton & Young_\r\nAigrettes         3,069 ounces    Aigrettes         1,606 ounces\r\nHerons              960 \"         Herons              250 \"\r\nBirds of Paradise 1,920 skins     Paradise          4,330 bodies\r\n\r\n_Sold by Figgis & Co.

The reason is\r\nthat there are no longer enough birds of that group to hold a place in\r\nthe London market! Few indeed are the Americans who know that from 1900\r\nto 1908 the lake region of southern Oregon was the scene of the\r\nslaughter of uncountable thousands of those birds, which continued until\r\nthe grebes were almost exterminated.\r\n\r\nWhen the wonderful lyre-bird of Australia had been almost exterminated\r\nfor its tail feathers, its open slaughter was stopped by law, and a\r\nheavy fine was imposed on exportation, amounting, I have been told, to\r\n$250 for each offense. My latest news of the lyre-bird was of the\r\nsurreptitious exportation of 200 skins to the London feather market.\r\n\r\nIn India, the smuggling outward of the skins of protected birds is\r\nconstantly going on. Occasionally an exporter is caught and fined; but\r\nthat does not stop the traffic.\r\n\r\nBird-lovers must now bid farewell forever to all the birds of paradise.\r\nNothing but the legal closing of the world's markets against their\r\nplumes and skins can save any of them. They never were numerous; nor\r\ndoes any species range over a wide area. They are strictly insular, and\r\nthe island homes of some of them are very small. Take the great bird of\r\nparadise (_Paradisea apoda_) as an illustration. On Oct. 2, 1912, at\r\nIndianapolis, Indiana, a city near the center of the United States, in\r\nthree show-windows within 100 feet of the headquarters of the Fourth\r\nNational Conservation Congress, I counted 11 stuffed heads and 11\r\ncomplete sets of plumes of this bird, displayed for sale. The prices\r\nranged from $30 to $47.50 each! And while I looked, a large lady\r\napproached, pointed her finger at the remains of a greater bird of\r\nparadise, and with grim determination, said to her shopping companion:\r\n\"There! I want one o' them, an' I'm agoin' to _have_ it, too!\"\r\n\r\nSays Mr. James Buckland in \"Pros and Cons of the Plumage Bill\":\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Goodfellow has returned within the last few weeks from a second\r\nexpedition to new Guinea.... One can now walk, he states, miles and\r\nmiles through the former haunts of these birds [of paradise] without\r\nseeing or hearing even the commonest species. When I reflect on this\r\nsacrilege, I am lost in wonder at the apathy of the British public.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Carl Hagenbeck wrote me only three months ago that \"the condors of\r\nthe Andes are all being exterminated for their feathers, and these birds\r\nare now very difficult to obtain.\"\r\n\r\nThe egret and heron plumes, known under the trade name of \"osprey, etc.,\r\nfeathers,\" form by far the most important item in each feather sale.\r\nThere are _fifteen_ grades! They are sold by the ounce, and the prices\r\nrange all the way from twenty-eight cents per ounce for \"mixed heron\" to\r\n_two hundred and twenty-five shillings_ ($45.60) per ounce for the best\r\nBrazilian \"short selected,\" on February 7, 1912! Is it any wonder that\r\nin Philadelphia the prices of finished aigrettes, ready to be worn, runs\r\nfrom $20 to $125!\r\n\r\nThe plumes that run up into the big figures are the \"short selected\"\r\ncoming from the following localities, and quoted at the prices set down\r\nhere in shillings and pence. Count the shilling at twenty-four cents,\r\nUnited States money.\r\n\r\nPRICES OF \"SHORT SELECTED\" EGRET AND HERON PLUMES, IN LONDON ON FEBRUARY\r\n7, 1912\r\n\r\n(Lewis & Peat's List)\r\n\r\nEast Indies per ounce, 117/6 to 207/6 = $49.80 max.\r\nRangoon      \"    \"    150/0  \" 192/6 =  46.20  \"\r\nChina        \"    \"    130/0  \" 245/0 =  58.80  \"\r\nBrazil       \"    \"    200/0  \" 225/0 =  54.00  \"\r\nVenezuela    \"    \"    165/0  \" 222/6 =  53.40  \"\r\n\r\nThe total offering of these \"short selected\" plumes in December 1911,\r\nwas 689 ounces, and in February, 1912, it was 230 ounces.\r\n\r\nNow with these enormous prices prevailing, is it any wonder that the\r\negrets and herons are being relentlessly pursued to the uttermost ends\r\nof the earth? I think that any man who really knows the habits of egrets\r\nand herons, and the total impossibility of any quantity of their shed\r\nfeathers being picked up in a marketable state, must know in his heart\r\nthat if the London and continental feather markets keep open a few years\r\nlonger, _every species_ that furnishes \"short selected\" plumes will be\r\nutterly exterminated from off the face of the earth.\r\n\r\nLet the English people make no mistake about this, nor be fooled by any\r\nfairy tales of the feather trade about Venezuelan \"garceros,\" and vast\r\nquantities of valuable plumes picked off the bushes and out of the mud.\r\nThose carefully concocted egret-farm stories make lovely reading, but\r\nthe reader who examines the evidence will soon decide the extent of\r\ntheir truthfulness. I think that they contain not even ten per cent of\r\ntruth; and I shall not rest until the stories of Leon Laglaize and\r\nMayeul Grisol have been put to the test in the regions where they\r\noriginated.\r\n\r\nA _few_ plumes may be picked out of the jungle, yes; but as for any\r\n_commercial quantity_, it is at present beyond belief. Besides, we have\r\ndirect, eye-witness testimony to the contrary.\r\n\r\nIt must not be inferred that the friends of birds in England have been\r\nidle or silent in the presence of the London feather trade. On the\r\ncontrary, the Royal Society for the Protection of Wild Birds and Mr.\r\nJames Buckland have so strongly attacked the feather industry that the\r\nLondon Chamber of Commerce has felt called upon to come to its rescue.\r\nMr. Buckland, on his own individual account, has done yeoman service to\r\nthe cause, and his devotion to the birds, and his tireless energy, are\r\nboth almost beyond the reach of praise in words. At the last moment\r\nbefore going to press I learn that the birds'-plumage bill has achieved\r\nthe triumph of a \"first reading\" in Parliament, which looks as if\r\nsuccess is at last in sight. The powerful pamphlet that he has written,\r\npublished and circulated at his own expense, entitled \"Pros and Cons of\r\nthe Plumage Bill,\" is a splendid effort. What a pity it is that more\r\nindividuals are not similarly inspired to make independent effort in the\r\nprotection cause! But, strange to say, few indeed are the men who have\r\neither the nerve or the ability to \"go it alone.\"\r\n\r\nOn the introduction in Parliament of the bill to save the birds from the\r\nfeather trade, it was opposed (through the efforts of the Chamber of\r\nCommerce), on the ground that if any bill against the sale of plumes\r\nshould pass, and plumes could not be sold, the London business in\r\nwild-bird skins and feathers \"would immediately be transferred to the\r\ncontinent!\"\r\n\r\nIn the face of that devastating and altogether horrible prospect, and\r\nbecause the London feather dealers \"need the money,\" the bill was at\r\nfirst defeated--to the great joy of the Chamber of Commerce and Mr.\r\nDownham; but the cause of birds will win in the end, because it is\r\nRight.\r\n\r\nThe feather dealers have been shrewdly active in the defense of their\r\ntrade, and the methods they have employed for influencing public opinion\r\nhave quite outshone those put forth by their brethren in America. I have\r\nbefore me a copy of a booklet bearing the name of Mr. C.F. Downham as\r\nthe author, and the London Chamber of Commerce has loaned its good name\r\nas publisher. Altogether it is a very shrewd piece of work, even though\r\nits arguments in justification of bird slaughter for the feather market\r\nare too absurd and weak for serious consideration.\r\n\r\nThe chief burden of the defender of bird slaughter for millinery\r\npurposes is on account of the destruction of egrets and herons, but\r\nparticularly the former. To offset as far as possible the absolutely\r\ntrue charge that egrets bear their best plumes in their breeding season,\r\nwhen the helpless young are in the nest and the parent birds must be\r\nkilled to obtain the plumes, the feather trade has obtained from three\r\nFrenchmen--Leon Laglaize, Mayeul Grisol, and F. Geay--a beautiful and\r\nplausible story to the effect that in Venezuela the enormous output of\r\negret plumes has been obtained _by picking up, off the bushes and out of\r\nthe water and mud, the shed feathers of those birds!_ According to the\r\nstory, Venezuela is full of _egret farms_, called \"garceros,\"--where the\r\nbirds breed and moult under strict supervision, and kindly drop their\r\nfeathers in such places that it is possible _to find them_, and to _pick\r\nthem up_, in a high state of preservation! And we are asked to believe\r\nthat it is these very Venezuelan picked-up feathers that command in\r\nLondon the high price of _$44 per ounce_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FIGHT IN ENGLAND AGAINST THE USE OF WILD BIRD'S\r\nPLUMAGE IN THE MILLINERY TRADE\r\nSandwich-men Employed by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds,\r\nthat Patroled London Streets in July, 1911.]\r\n\r\nMr. Laglaize is especially exploited by Mr. Downham, as a French\r\ntraveler of high standing, and well known in the zoological museums of\r\nFrance; but, sad to say, when Prof. Henry Fairfield Osborn cabled to the\r\nMuseum of Natural History in Paris, inquiring about Mr. Laglaize, the\r\ncable flashed back the one sad word; \"_Inconnu!_\" (Unknown!)\r\n\r\nI think it entirely possible that enough shed feathers have been picked\r\nup in the reeking swamps of Venezuela, on the upper tributaries of the\r\nOrinoco, to afford _an excuse_ for the beautiful story of Mr. Laglaize.\r\nAny shrewd individual with money, and the influence that money secures,\r\ncould put up just such a \"plant\" as I firmly believe _has_ been put up\r\nby some one in Venezuela. I will guarantee that I could accomplish such\r\na job in Venezuela or Brazil, in four months' time, at an expense not\r\nexceeding one thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nThat the great supply of immaculately perfect egret plumes that annually\r\ncome out of Venezuela could by any possibility be picked up in the\r\nswamps where they were shed and dropped by the egrets, is entirely\r\npreposterous and incredible. The whole proportion is denounced by\r\nseveral men of standing and experience, none of whom are \"_inconnu_.\"\r\n\r\nAs a sweeping refutation of the fantastic statements regarding\r\n\"garceros,\" published by Mr. Downham as coming from Messrs. Laglaize,\r\nGrisol and Geay, I offer the written testimony of an American gentleman\r\nwho at this moment owns and maintains within a few yards of his\r\nresidence a large preserve of snowy egrets and herons, the former\r\nrepresenting the species which furnishes egret plumes exactly similar to\r\nthose shipped from Venezuela and Brazil. If the testimony of Mr.\r\nMcIlhenny is not sufficient to stamp the statements of the three\r\nFrenchmen quoted by Mr. Downham as absolute and thoroughly misleading\r\nfalsehoods, then there is no such thing in this world as evidence. I\r\nsuggest a perusal of the statements of the three Frenchmen who are\r\nquoted with such confidence by Mr. Downham and published by the Hon.\r\nChamber of Commerce at London, and then a careful reading of the\r\nfollowing letter:\r\n\r\n  Avery Island, La., June 17, 1912.\r\n\r\n  DEAR MR. HORNADAY:--\r\n\r\n  I have before me your letter of June 8th, asking for information as\r\n  to whether or no egrets shed their plumes at their nesting places in\r\n  sufficient quantities to enable them to be gathered commercially. I\r\n  most emphatically wish to state that it is impossible to gather at\r\n  the nesting places of these birds any quantity of their plumes. I\r\n  have nesting within 50 yards of where I am now sitting dictating\r\n  this letter not less than 20,000 pairs of the various species of\r\n  herons and egrets, and there are fully 2,500 pairs of snowy herons\r\n  nesting within my preserve.\r\n\r\n  During the nesting season, which covers the months of April, May and\r\n  June, I am through this heronry in a small canoe almost every day,\r\n  and often twice a day. I have had these herons under my close\r\n  inspection for the past 17 years, and I have not in any one season\r\n  picked up or seen more than half a dozen discarded plumes. Such\r\n  plumes as I have picked up, I have kept on my desk, and given to the\r\n  people who were interested. I remember that last year I picked up\r\n  four plumes of the snowy heron that were in one bunch. I think these\r\n  must have been plucked out by the birds fighting.\r\n\r\n  This year I have found only one plume so far. I enclose it herewith.\r\n  You will notice that it is one of the shorter plumes, and is badly\r\n  worn at the end, as have been all the plumes which I have picked up\r\n  in my heronry.\r\n\r\n  I am positive that it is not possible for natural shed plumes to be\r\n  gathered commercially. I have a number of times talked with plume\r\n  hunters from Venezuela and other South American countries, and I\r\n  have never heard of any egret feathers being gathered by their being\r\n  picked up after the birds have shed them.\r\n\r\n  I have heard of a number of heronries in South America that are\r\n  protected by the land owners for the purpose of gathering a yearly\r\n  crop of egret plumes, but this crop is gathered always by shooting a\r\n  certain percentage of the birds. This shooting is done by experts\r\n  with 22-calibre rifles, and does not materially disturb the nesting\r\n  colony. I have known of two men who have been engaged in killing the\r\n  birds on large estates in South America, who were paid regular\r\n  salaries for their services as egret hunters.\r\n\r\n  Very truly yours,\r\n\r\n  E.A. McIlhenny.\r\n\r\nI am more than willing to set the above against the fairy tale of Mr.\r\nLaglaize.\r\n\r\nHere is the testimony of A.H. Meyer, an ex-plume-hunter, who for nine\r\nyears worked in Venezuela. His sworn testimony was laid before the\r\nLegislature of the State of New York, in 1911, when the New York\r\nMilliners' Association was frantically endeavoring to secure the repeal\r\nof the splendid Dutcher law. This witness was produced by the National\r\nAssociation of Audubon Societies.\r\n\r\n\"My attention has been called to the fact that certain commercial\r\ninterests in this city are circulating stories in the newspapers and\r\nelsewhere to the effect that the aigrettes used in the millinery trade\r\ncome chiefly from Venezuela, where they are gathered from the ground in\r\nthe large _garceros_, or breeding-colonies, of white herons.\r\n\r\n\"I wish to state that I have personally engaged in the work of\r\ncollecting the plumes of these birds in Venezuela. This was my business\r\nfor the years 1896 to 1905, inclusive. I am thoroughly conversant with\r\nthe methods employed in gathering egret and snowy heron plumes in\r\nVenezuela, and I wish to give the following statement regarding the\r\npractices employed in procuring these feathers:\r\n\r\n\"The birds gather in large colonies to rear their young. They have the\r\nplumes only during the mating and nesting season. After the period when\r\nthey are employed in caring for their young, it is found that the plumes\r\nare virtually of no commercial value, because of the worn and frayed\r\ncondition to which they have been reduced. It is the custom in Venezuela\r\nto shoot the birds while the young are in the nests. A few feathers of\r\nthe large white heron (American egret), known as the _Garza blanca_, can\r\nbe picked up of a morning about their breeding places, but these are of\r\nsmall value and are known as \"dead feathers.\" They are worth locally not\r\nover three dollars an ounce; while the feathers taken from the bird,\r\nknown as \"live feathers,\" are worth fifteen dollars an ounce.\r\n\r\n\"My work led me into every part of Venezuela and Colombia where these\r\nbirds are to be found, and I have never yet found or heard of any\r\n_garceros_ that were guarded for the purpose of simply gathering the\r\nfeathers from the ground. No such condition exists in Venezuela. The\r\nstory is absolutely without foundation, in my opinion, and has simply\r\nbeen put forward for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\n\"The natives of the country, who do virtually all of the hunting for\r\nfeathers, are not provident in their nature, and their practices are of\r\na most cruel and brutal nature. I have seen them frequently pull the\r\nplumes from wounded birds, leaving the crippled birds to die of\r\nstarvation, unable to respond to the cries of their young in the nests\r\nabove, which were calling for food. _I have known these people to tie\r\nand prop up wounded egrets on the marsh where they would attract the\r\nattention of other birds flying by. These decoys they keep in this\r\nposition until they die of their wounds, or from the attacks of insects.\r\nI have seen the terrible red ants of that country actually eating out\r\nthe eyes of these wounded, helpless birds that were tied up by the\r\nplume-hunters._ I could write you many pages of the horrors practiced in\r\ngathering aigrette feathers in Venezuela by the natives for the\r\nmillinery trade of Paris and New York.\r\n\r\n\"To illustrate the comparatively small number of dead feathers which\r\nare collected, I will mention that in one year I and my associates\r\nshipped to New York eighty pounds of the plumes of the large heron and\r\ntwelve pounds of the little recurved plumes of the snowy heron. In this\r\nwhole lot there were not over five pounds of plumes that had been\r\ngathered from the ground--and these were of little value. The\r\nplume-birds have been nearly exterminated in the United States and\r\nMexico, and the same condition of affairs will soon exist in tropical\r\nAmerica. This extermination will come about because of the fact that the\r\nyoung are left to starve in the nest when the old birds are killed, any\r\nother statement made by interested parties to the contrary\r\nnotwithstanding.\r\n\r\n\"I am so incensed at the ridiculously absurd and misleading stories that\r\nare being published on this question that I want to give you this\r\nletter, and, before delivering it to you, shall take oath to its\r\ntruthfulness.\"\r\n\r\nHere is the testimony of Mr. Caspar Whitney, of New York, formerly\r\neditor of _Outing_ Magazine and _Outdoor America_:\r\n\r\n\"During extended travel throughout South America, from 1903 to 1907,\r\ninclusive, I journeyed, on three separate occasions, by canoe\r\n(1904-1907), on the Lower Orinoco and Apure rivers and their\r\ntributaries. This is the region, so far as Venezuela is concerned, in\r\nwhich is the greatest slaughter of white herons for their plumage, or\r\nmore specifically for the marital plumes, which are carried only in the\r\nmating and breeding season, and are known in the millinery trade as\r\n'aigrettes.'\r\n\r\n\"There is literally no room for question. The snowy herons are killed\r\nexactly as I describe. It is the custom of all those who hunt for the\r\nmillinery trade, and is recognized by the natives as the usual method.\"\r\n\r\nHere is the testimony of Mr. Julian A. Dimock, of Peekamose, N.Y., the\r\nfamous outdoor photographer, and illustrator of \"Florida Enchantments\":\r\n\r\n\"I know a goodly number of the plume-hunters of Florida. I have camped\r\nwith them, and talked to them. I have heard their tales, and even full\r\naccounts of the 'shooting-up' of an egret rookery. Never has a man in\r\nFlorida suggested to me that plumes could be obtained without killing\r\nthe birds. I have known the wardens, and have visited rookeries after\r\nthey had been 'shot-up,' and the evidence all pointed to the everlasting\r\nuse of the gun. _It is certainly not true that the plumes can be\r\nobtained without killing the birds bearing them_.\r\n\r\n\"Nineteen years ago, I visited the Cuthbert Rookery with one of the men\r\nwho discovered the birds nesting in that lake. He and his partner had\r\nsold the plumes gathered there for more than a thousand dollars. He\r\nshowed me how they hid in the bushes and shot the birds. He even gave me\r\na chance to watch him kill two or three birds.\r\n\r\n\"I know personally the man chiefly responsible for the slaughter of the\r\nbirds at Alligator Bay. _He laughed at the idea of getting plumes\r\nwithout killing the birds!_ I well know the man who shot the birds up\r\nRogers River, and even saw some of the empty shells left on the ground\r\nby him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: YOUNG EGRETS, UNABLE TO FLY, STARVING\r\nThe Parent Birds had Been Killed by Plume Hunters]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SNOWY EGRET, DEAD ON HER NEST\r\nWounded in the Feeding-Grounds, and Came Home to Die. Photographed in a\r\nFlorida Rookery Protected by the National Association of Audubon\r\nSocieties]\r\n\r\nI have camped with Seminoles, whites, blacks, outlaws, and those within\r\nthe pale, connected with plume-hunting, and all tell the same story:\r\n_The birds are shot to get the plumes._ The evidence of my own eyes, and\r\nthe action of the birds themselves, convinces me that there is not a\r\nshadow of doubt concerning this point.\"\r\n\r\nThis sworn testimony from Mr. T.J. Ashe, of Key West, Florida, is very\r\ndirect and to the point:\r\n\r\n\"I have seen many moulted and dropped feathers from wild plumed birds. I\r\nhave never seen a moulted or dropped feather that was fit for anything.\r\nIt is the exception when a plumed bird drops feathers of any value while\r\nin flight. Whatever feathers are so dropped are those that are frayed,\r\nworn out, and forced out by the process of moulting. The moulting season\r\nis not during the hatching season, but is after the hatching season. The\r\nshedding, or moulting, takes place once a year; and during this moulting\r\nseason the feathers, after having the hard usage of the year from wind,\r\nrain and other causes, when dropped are of absolutely no commercial\r\nvalue.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Arthur T. Wayne, of Mount Pleasant, S.C., relates in sworn testimony\r\nhis experience in attempting to secure egret plumes without killing the\r\nbirds:\r\n\r\n\"It is utterly impossible to get fifty egret plumes from any colony of\r\nbreeding birds without shooting the birds. Last spring, I went twice a\r\nweek to a breeding colony of American and snowy egrets, from early in\r\nApril until June 8. Despite the fact that I covered miles of territory\r\nin a boat, I picked up but two American egret plumes (which I now have);\r\nbut not a single snowy egret plume did I see, nor did my companion, who\r\naccompanied me on every trip.\r\n\r\n\"I saw an American egret plume on the water, and left it, purposely, to\r\nsee whether it would sink or not. Upon visiting the place a few days\r\nafterwards, the plume was not in evidence, undoubtedly having sunk. The\r\nplumes are chiefly shed in the air while the birds are going to or\r\ncoming from their breeding grounds. If that millinery plume law is\r\nrepealed, the fate of the American and snowy egrets is sealed, for the\r\nfew birds that remain will be shot to the very last one.\"\r\n\r\nAny man who ever has been in an egret rookery (and I have) knows that\r\nthe above testimony is _true_! The French story of the beautiful and\r\nsmoothly-running egret farms in Venezuela is preposterous, save for a\r\nmere shadow of truth. I do not say that _no_ egret plumes could be\r\npicked up, but I do assert that the total quantity obtainable in one\r\nyear in that way would be utterly trivial.\r\n\r\nNo; the \"ospreys\" of the British feather market come from slaughtered\r\negrets and herons, _killed in the breeding season_. Let the British\r\npublic and the British Parliament make no mistake about that. If they\r\nwish the trade to continue, let it be based on the impregnable ground\r\nthat the merchants want the money, and not on a fantastic dream that is\r\ntoo silly to deceive even a child that knows birds.\r\n\r\nThe use or disuse of wild birds' plumage as millinery ornaments is\r\nanother of those wild-life subjects regarding which there is no room for\r\nargument. To assert that the feather-dealers want the business for the\r\nmoney it brings them is not argument! We have seen many a steam roller\r\ngo over Truth, and Right, and Justice, by main strength and red-hot\r\npower; but Truth and Right refuse to stay flat down. There is on this\r\nearth not one wild-animal species--mammal, bird or reptile--that can\r\nlong withstand exploitation for commercial purposes. Even the whales of\r\nthe deep sea, the walrus of the arctic regions, the condors of the Andes\r\nand alligators of the Everglade morasses are no exception to the\r\nuniversal rule.\r\n\r\nIn Mr. Downham's book there is much fallacious reasoning, and many\r\nconclusions that are not borne out by the facts. For example, he says\r\nthat no species of bird of paradise has been diminished in number by\r\nslaughter for the feather trade; that Florida still contains a supply of\r\negrets; that the decrease in bird life should be charged to the spread\r\nof cities, towns and farms, and not to the trade; that the trade was \"in\r\nno way responsible\" for the slaughter of three hundred thousand gulls\r\nand albatrosses on Laysan Island!\r\n\r\nI have space to notice one other important erroneous conclusion that Mr.\r\nDownham publishes in his book, on page 105. He says:\r\n\r\n\"The destruction of birds in foreign countries is something that no\r\ntrade can direct or control.\"\r\n\r\nThis is an amazing declaration; and absolutely contrary to experience.\r\nLet me prove what I say by a fresh and incontestable illustration:\r\n\r\nPrior to April, 1911, when Governor Dix signed the Bayne law against the\r\nsale of wild native game in the State of New York, Currituck County,\r\nN.C., was a vast slaughter-pen for wild fowl. No power or persuasion had\r\navailed to induce the people of North Carolina to check, or regulate, or\r\nin any manner mitigate that slaughter of geese, ducks and swans. It was\r\nestimated that two hundred thousand wild fowl were annually slaughtered\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nWe who advocated the Bayne law said: \"Close the New York markets against\r\nCurrituck birds, and you will stop a great deal of the slaughter.\"\r\n\r\nWe cleaned our Augean stable. The greatest game market in America was\r\nabsolutely closed.\r\n\r\nLast winter (1911) the annual killing of wild fowl was fully fifty per\r\ncent less than during previous years. In one small town, twenty\r\nprofessional duck shooters went entirely out of business--because they\r\n_couldn't sell their ducks_! The dealers refused to buy them. The result\r\nwas exactly what we predicted it would be; and this year, it is reported\r\nover and over that ducks are more plentiful in New England than they\r\nhave been in twenty years previously! The result is wonderful, because\r\nso quick.\r\n\r\nBeyond all question, the feather merchants of London, Paris and Berlin\r\nabsolutely control the bird-killers of Venezuela, China, New Guinea.\r\nMexico and South America. Let the word go forth that \"the trade\" is no\r\nlonger permitted to buy and sell egret and heron plumes, skins of birds\r\nof paradise and condor feathers, and presto! the killing industry falls\r\ndead the next moment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MISCELLANEOUS BIRD SKINS, 8 CENTS EACH\r\nPurchased by the New York Zoological Society from the Quarterly Sale in\r\nLondon, August, 1912]\r\n\r\nYes, indeed, members of the British Parliament: it is easily within\r\n_your power_ to wipe out at a single stroke fully one-half of the bird\r\nslaughter for fancy feathers. It can be done just as we wiped out\r\none-half the annual duck slaughter in wickedly-wasteful North Carolina!\r\n\r\nThe feather trade absolutely _does_ control the killing situation! Now,\r\nwill the people of England clean house by controlling the feather trade?\r\nIf a hundred species of the most beautiful birds of the world must be\r\nexterminated for the feather trade, let the odium rest elsewhere than on\r\nthe people of England.\r\n\r\nThe bird-lovers of America may rest assured that the bird-lovers of\r\nEngland--a mighty host--are neither careless nor indifferent regarding\r\nthe wild-birds' plumage business. On the contrary, several bills have\r\nbeen brought before Parliament intended to regulate or prohibit the\r\ntraffic, and a measure of vast importance to the birds of the world is\r\nnow before the House of Commons. It is backed by Mr. Percy Alden, M.P.,\r\nby the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, by the Selbourne\r\nSociety, and by Mr. James Buckland--a host in himself. For years past\r\nthat splendidly-equipped and well-managed Royal Society has waged\r\nceaseless warfare for the birds. Its activity has been tremendous, and\r\nits membership list contains many of the finest names in England. The\r\naddress of the Honorary Secretary, Frank E. Lemon, Esq., is 23 Queen\r\nAnne's Gate, London, S.W.\r\n\r\nNaturally, these influences are opposed by the Textile Trade Section of\r\nthe London Chamber of Commerce, and their only argument consists of the\r\nplea that if London doesn't get the money out of the feather trade, the\r\nContinent will get it! A reasonable, logical, magnificent and convincing\r\nexcuse for wholesale bird slaughter, truly!\r\n\r\nMr. Buckland has been informed from the Continent that the people of\r\nFrance, Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium are waiting and watching to\r\nsee what England is going to do with the question, \"To slaughter, or not\r\nto slaughter?\" For England has no monopoly of the birds' plumage trade,\r\nnot by any means. Says Mr. Buckland (\"Pros and Cons of the Plumage\r\nBill,\" page 17):\r\n\r\n\"As regards the vast majority of fancy feathers used in millinery, the\r\nContinent receives its own supplies. The feathers of the hundreds of\r\nthousands of albatrosses which are killed in the North Pacific all go to\r\nParis. Of the untold thousands of 'magpies,' owls, and other species\r\nwhich come from Peru, not one skin or feather crosses the Channel. The\r\nwhite herons of the Upper Senegal and the Niger are being rapidly\r\nexterminated at the instigation of the feather merchants, but not one of\r\nthe plumes reaches London. Paris receives direct a large supply of\r\naigrettes from South America and elsewhere.... The millions of\r\nswallows and other migratory birds which are killed annually as they\r\npass through Italy, France and Spain on their way north, supply the\r\nmillinery trade of Europe with an incredible quantity of wings and other\r\nplumage, but none of it is distributed from London.... London, as a\r\ndistributing center, has no monopoly of the trade in raw feathers.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Buckland's green-covered pamphlet is a powerful document, and both\r\nhis facts and his conclusions seem to be unassailable. The author's\r\naddress is Royal Colonial Institute, Northumberland Ave., London, W.C.\r\n\r\nThe duty of the civilized nations of Europe is perfectly plain. The\r\nsavage and bloody business in feathers torn from wild birds should be\r\nstopped, completely and forever. If the commons will not arise and\r\nreform the odious business out of existence, then the kings and queens\r\nand presidents should do their plain duty. In the suppression of a world\r\ncrime like this it is clearly a case of _noblesse oblige_!\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nTHE BIRD TRAGEDY ON LAYSAN ISLAND\r\n\r\n\r\nThis chapter is a curtain-dropper to the preceding chapter. As a\r\nclearly-cut, concrete case, the reader will find it unique and\r\nunsurpassed. It should be of lively interest to every American because\r\nthe tragedy occurred on American territory.\r\n\r\nIn the far-away North Pacific Ocean, about seven hundred miles from\r\nHonolulu west-b'-north, lies the small island of Laysan. It is level,\r\nsandy, poorly planted by nature, and barren of all things likely to\r\nenlist the attention of predatory man. To the harassed birds of\r\nmid-ocean, it seemed like a secure haven, and for ages past it has been\r\ninhabited only by them. There several species of sea birds, large and\r\nsmall, have found homes and breeding places. Until 1909, the inhabitants\r\nconsisted of the Laysan albatross, black-footed albatross, sooty tern,\r\ngray-backed tern, noddy tern, Hawaiian tern, white tern, Bonin petrel,\r\ntwo shearwaters, the red-tailed tropic bird, two boobies and the\r\nman-of-war bird.\r\n\r\nLaysan Island is two miles long by one and one-half miles broad, and at\r\ntimes it has been literally covered with birds. Its bird life was first\r\nbrought prominently to notice in 1891, by Henry Palmer, the agent of\r\nHon. Walter Rothschild, and in 1902 and 1903 Walter K. Fisher and W.A.\r\nBryan made further observations.\r\n\r\nEver since 1891 the bird life on Laysan has been regarded as one of the\r\nwonders of the bird world. One of the photographs taken prior to 1909\r\nshows a vast plain, apparently a square mile in area, covered and\r\ncrowded with Laysan albatrosses. They stand there on the level sand,\r\nserene, bulky and immaculate. Thousands of birds appear in one view--a\r\nvery remarkable sight.\r\n\r\nNaturally man, the ever-greedy, began to cast about for ways by which to\r\nconvert some product of that feathered host into money. At first guano\r\nand eggs were collected. A tramway was laid down and small box-cars were\r\nintroduced, in which the collected material was piled and pushed down to\r\nthe packing place.\r\n\r\nFor several years this went on, and the birds themselves were not\r\nmolested. At last, however, a tentacle of the feather-trade octopus\r\nreached out to Laysan. In an evil moment in the spring of 1909, a\r\npredatory individual of Honolulu and elsewhere, named Max Schlemmer,\r\ndecided that the wings of those albatross, gulls and terns should be\r\ntorn off and sent to Japan, whence they would undoubtedly be shipped to\r\nParis, the special market for the wings of sea-birds slaughtered in the\r\nNorth Pacific.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LAYSAN ALBATROSSES, BEFORE THE GREAT SLAUGHTER\r\nBy the Courtesy of Hon. Walter Rothschild.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LAYSAN ALBATROSS ROOKERY, AFTER THE GREAT SLAUGHTER\r\nThe Same Ground as Shown in the Preceding Picture, Photographed in 1911\r\nby Prof. Homer R. Dill]\r\n\r\nSchlemmer the Slaughterer bought a cheap vessel, hired twenty-three\r\nphlegmatic and cold-blooded Japanese laborers, and organized a raid on\r\nLaysan. With the utmost secrecy he sailed from Honolulu, landed his\r\nbird-killers upon the sea-bird wonderland, and turned them loose upon\r\nthe birds.\r\n\r\nFor several months they slaughtered diligently and without mercy.\r\nApparently it was the ambition of Schlemmer to kill every bird on the\r\nisland.\r\n\r\nBy the time the bird-butchers had accumulated between three and four\r\ncar-loads of wings, and the carnage was half finished, William A. Bryan,\r\nProfessor of Zoology in the College of Honolulu, heard of it and\r\npromptly wired the United States Government.\r\n\r\nWithout the loss of a moment the Secretary of the Navy despatched the\r\nrevenue cutter _Thetis_ to the shambles of Laysan. When Captain Jacobs\r\narrived he found that in round numbers about _three hundred thousand_\r\nbirds had been destroyed, and all that remained of them were several\r\nacres of bones and dead bodies, and about three carloads of wings,\r\nfeathers and skins. It was evident that Schlemmer's intention was to\r\nkill all the birds on the island, and only the timely arrival of the\r\n_Thetis_ frustrated that bloody plan.\r\n\r\nThe twenty-three Japanese poachers were arrested and taken to Honolulu\r\nfor trial, and the _Thetis_ also brought away all the stolen wings and\r\nplumage with the exception of one shedful of wings that had to be left\r\nbehind on account of lack of carrying space. That old shed, with one\r\nend torn out, and supposed to contain nearly fifty thousand pairs of\r\nwings, was photographed by Prof. Dill in 1911, as shown herewith.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ACRES OF GULL AND ALBATROSS BONES\r\nPhotographed on Laysan Island by H.R. Dill, 1911]\r\n\r\nThree hundred thousand albatrosses, gulls, terns and other birds were\r\nbutchered to make a Schlemmer holiday! Had the arrival of the _Thetis_\r\nbeen delayed, it is reasonably certain that every bird on Laysan would\r\nhave been killed to satisfy the wolfish rapacity of one money-grubbing\r\nwhite man.\r\n\r\nIn 1911, the Iowa State University despatched to Laysan a scientific\r\nexpedition in charge of Prof. Homer R. Dill. The party landed on the\r\nisland on April 24 and remained until June 5, and the report of\r\nProfessor Dill (U.S. Department of Agriculture) is consumedly\r\ninteresting to the friends of birds. Here is what he has said regarding\r\nthe evidences of bird-slaughter:\r\n\r\n\"Our first impression of Laysan was that the poachers had stripped the\r\nplace of bird life. An area of over 300 acres on each side of the\r\nbuildings was apparently abandoned. Only the shearwaters moaning in\r\ntheir burrows, the little wingless rail skulking from one grass tussock\r\nto another, and the saucy finch remained. It is an excellent example of\r\nwhat Prof. Nutting calls the survival of the inconspicuous.\r\n\r\n\"Here on every side are bones bleaching in the sun, showing where the\r\npoachers had piled the bodies of the birds as they stripped them of\r\nwings and feathers. In the old open guano shed were seen the remains of\r\nhundreds and possibly thousands of wings which were placed there but\r\nnever cured for shipping, as the marauders were interrupted in their\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHED PILLED WITH WINGS OF SLAUGHTERED BIRDS ON LAYSAN\r\nISLAND]\r\n\r\n\"An old cistern back of one of the buildings tells a story of cruelty\r\nthat surpasses anything else done by these heartless, sanguinary\r\npirates, not excepting the practice of cutting wings from living birds\r\nand leaving them to die of hemorrhage. In this dry cistern the living\r\nbirds were kept by hundreds to slowly starve to death. In this way the\r\nfatty tissue lying next to the skin was used up, and the skin was left\r\nquite free from grease, so that it required little or no cleaning during\r\npreparation.\r\n\r\n\"Many other revolting sights, such as the remains of young birds that\r\nhad been left to starve, and birds with broken legs and deformed beaks\r\nwere to be seen. Killing clubs, nets and other implements used by these\r\nmarauders were lying all about. Hundreds of boxes to be used in shipping\r\nthe bird skins were packed in an old building. It was very evident they\r\nintended to carry on their slaughter as long as the birds lasted.\r\n\r\n\"Not only did they kill and skin the larger species but they caught and\r\ncaged the finch, honey eater, and miller bird. Cages and material for\r\nmaking them were found.\"--(Report of an Expedition to Laysan Island in\r\n1911. By Homer R. Dill, page 12.)\r\n\r\nThe report of Professor Bryan contains the following pertinent\r\nparagraphs:\r\n\r\n\"This wholesale killing has had an appalling effect on the colony.... It\r\nis conservative to say that fully one-half the number of birds of both\r\nspecies of albatross that were so abundant everywhere in 1903 have been\r\nkilled. The colonies that remain are in a sadly decimated condition....\r\nOver a large part of the island, in some sections a hundred acres in a\r\nplace, that ten years ago were thickly inhabited by albatrosses not a\r\nsingle bird remains, while heaps of the slain lie as mute testimony of\r\nthe awful slaughter of these beautiful, harmless, and without doubt\r\nbeneficial inhabitants of the high seas.\r\n\r\n\"While the main activity of the plume-hunters was directed against the\r\nalbatrosses, they were by no means averse to killing anything in the\r\nbird line that came in their way.... Fortunately, serious as were the\r\ndepredations of the poachers, their operations were interrupted before\r\nany of the species had been completely exterminated.\"\r\n\r\nBut the work of the Evil Genius of Laysan did not stop with the\r\nslaughter of three hundred thousand birds. Mr. Schlemmer introduced\r\nrabbits and guinea-pigs; and these rapidly multiplying rodents now are\r\nthreatening to consume every plant on the island. If the plants\r\ndisappear, many of the insects will go with them; and this will mean the\r\ndisappearance of the small insectivorous birds.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1909, President Roosevelt issued an executive order\r\ncreating the Hawaiian Islands Reservation for Birds. In this are\r\nincluded Laysan and twelve other islands and reefs, some of which are\r\ninhabited by birds that are well worth preserving. By this act, we may\r\nfeel that for the future the birds of Laysan and neighboring islets are\r\nsecure from further attacks by the bloody-handed agents of the vain\r\nwomen who still insist upon wearing the wings and feathers of wild\r\nbirds.\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nUNFAIR FIREARMS, AND SHOOTING ETHICS\r\n\r\n\r\nFor considerably more than a century, the States of the American Union\r\nhave enacted game-protective laws based on the principle that the wild\r\ngame belongs to the People, and the people's senators, representatives\r\nand legislators generally may therefore enact laws for its protection,\r\nprescribing the manner in which it may and may not be taken and\r\npossessed. The soundness of this principle has been fully confirmed by\r\nthe Supreme Court of the United States in the case of Geer vs.\r\nConnecticut, on March 2, 1896.\r\n\r\nThe tendency of predatory man to kill and capture wild game of all kinds\r\nby wholesale methods is as old as the human race. The days of the club,\r\nthe stone axe, the bow and arrow and the flint-lock gun were\r\ncontemporaneous with the days of great abundance of game. Now that the\r\nadvent of breech-loaders, repeaters, automatics and fixed ammunition has\r\nrendered game scarce in all localities save a very few, the thoughtful\r\nman is driven to consider measures for the checking of destruction and\r\nthe suppression of wholesale slaughter.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, the deadly floating batteries and sail-boats were\r\nprohibited. To-day a punt gun is justly regarded as a relic of\r\nbarbarism, and any man who uses one places himself beyond the pale of\r\ndecent sportsmanship, or even of modern pot-hunting. Strange to say,\r\nalthough the unwritten code of ethics of English sportsmen is very\r\nstrict, the English to this day permit wild-fowl hunting with guns of\r\nhuge calibre, some of which are more like shot-cannons than shot-guns.\r\nAnd they say, \"Well, there are still wild duck on our coast!\"\r\n\r\nBeyond question, it is now high time for the English people to take up\r\nthe shot-gun question, and consider what to-day is fair and unfair in\r\nthe killing of waterfowl. The supply of British ducks and geese can not\r\nforever withstand the market gunners and their shot-cannons. Has not the\r\nBritish wild-fowl supply greatly decreased during the past fifteen\r\nyears? I strongly suspect that a careful investigation would reveal the\r\nfact that it has diminished. The Society for the Preservation of the\r\nFauna of the Empire should look into the matter, and obtain a series of\r\nreports on the condition of the waterfowl to-day as compared with what\r\nit was twenty years ago.\r\n\r\nIn the United States we have eliminated the swivel guns, the punt guns\r\nand the very-big-bore guns. Among the real sportsmen the tendency is\r\nsteadily toward shot-guns of small calibre, especially under 12-gauge.\r\nBut, outside the ranks of sportsmen, we are now face to face with two\r\nautomatic and five \"pump\" shotguns of deadly efficiency. Of these, more\r\nthan one hundred thousand are being made and sold annually by the five\r\ncompanies that produce them. Recently the annual output has been\r\ncarefully estimated from known facts to be about as follows:\r\n\r\nWinchester Arms Co., New Haven, Conn.\r\n  (1 Automatic and 1 Pump-gun)                           50,000 guns.\r\nRemington Arms Co., Ilion, N.Y.\r\n  (1 Automatic and 1 Pump-gun)                           25,000  \"\r\nMarlin Fire Arms Co., New Haven, Conn. 1 Pump-gun        12,000  \"\r\nStevens Arms Co., Chicopee Falls, Mass. 1 Pump-gun       10,000  \"\r\nUnion Fire Arms Co., 1 Pump-gun                           5,000  \"\r\n                                                        ------------\r\n                                                        103,000 guns\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FOUR OF THE SEVEN MACHINE GUNS\r\n\r\nSTEVENS PUMP GUN, 6 SHOTS IN 6 SECONDS.\r\n\r\nWINCHESTER PUMP GUN, 6 SHOTS IN 6 SECONDS.\r\n\r\nREMINGTON AUTOMATIC, 5 SHOTS IN 4 SECONDS.\r\nLoaded and cocked by its own recoil.\r\n\r\nWINCHESTER AUTOLOADING. 5 SHOTS IN 4 SECONDS\r\nLoaded and cocked by its own recoil.]\r\n\r\nTHE ETHICS OF SHOOTING AND SHOT-GUNS.--Are the American people willing\r\nthat their wild birds shall be shot by machinery?\r\n\r\nIn the ethics of sportsmanship, the anglers of America are miles ahead\r\nof the men who handle the rifle and shot-gun in the hunting field. Will\r\nthe hunters ever catch up?\r\n\r\nThe anglers have steadily diminished the weight of the rod and the size\r\nof the line; and they have prohibited the use of gang hooks and nets. In\r\nthis respect the initiative of the Tuna Club of Santa Catalina is worthy\r\nof the highest admiration. Even though the leaping tuna, the jewfish and\r\nthe sword-fish are big and powerful, the club has elected to raise the\r\nstandard of sportsmanship by making captures more difficult than ever\r\nbefore. A higher degree of skill, and nerve and judgment, is required in\r\nthe angler who would make good on a big fish; and, incidentally, the\r\nfish has about double \"the show\" that it had fifteen years ago.\r\n\r\nThat is Sportsmanship!\r\n\r\nBut how is it with the men who handle the shot-gun?\r\n\r\nBy them, the Tuna Club's high-class principle has been exactly reversed!\r\nIn the making of fishing-rods, commercialism plays small part; but in\r\nabout forty cases out of every fifty the making of guns is solely a\r\nmatter of dollars and profits.\r\n\r\nExcepting the condemnation of automatic and pump guns, I think that few\r\nclubs of sportsmen have laid down laws designed to make shooting more\r\ndifficult, and to give the game more of a show to escape. Thousands of\r\ngentlemen sportsmen have their own separate unwritten codes of honor,\r\nbut so far as I know, few of them have been written out and adopted as\r\nbinding rules of action. I know that among expert wing shots it is an\r\nunwritten law that quail and grouse must not be shot on the ground, nor\r\nducks on the water. But, among the three million gunners who annually\r\nshoot in the United States how many, think you, are there who in actual\r\npractice observe any sentimental principles when in the presence of\r\nkillable game? I should say about one man and boy out of every five\r\nhundred.\r\n\r\nUp to this time, the great mass of men who handle guns have left it to\r\nthe gunmakers to make their codes of ethics, and hand them out with the\r\nloaded cartridges, all ready for use.\r\n\r\nFor fifty years the makers of shot-guns and rifles have taxed their\r\ningenuity and resources to make killing easier, especially for \"amateur\"\r\nsportsmen,--_and take still greater advantages of the game_! Look at\r\nthis scale of progression:\r\n\r\nFIFTY YEARS' INCREASE IN THE DEADLINESS OF FIREARMS.\r\n\r\nKIND OF GUN.

The Remington,\r\nWinchester, Marlin, Stevens and Union Companies are engaged in a mad\r\nrace to see who can turn out the deadliest guns, and the most of them.\r\nOn the market to-day there are five pump-guns, that fire six shots each,\r\nin about _six seconds_, without removal from the shoulder, by the quick\r\nsliding of a sleeve under the barrel, that ejects the empty shell and\r\ninserts a loaded one. There are two automatics that fire five shots each\r\nin _five seconds or less_, by five pulls on the trigger! _The\r\nautoloading gun is reloaded and cocked again wholly by its own recoil_.\r\nNow, if these are not machine guns, what are they?\r\n\r\nIn view of the great scarcity of feathered game, and the number of\r\ndeadly machine guns already on the market, the production of the last\r\nand deadliest automatic gun (by the Winchester Arms Company), _already\r\nin great demand_, is a crime against wild life, no less.\r\n\r\nEvery human action is a matter of taste and individual honor.\r\n\r\nIt is natural for the duck-butchers of Currituck to love the automatic\r\nshot-guns as they do, because they kill the most ducks per flock. With\r\ntwo of them in his boat, holding _ten shots_, one expert duck-killer\r\ncan,--and sometimes _actually does_, so it is said,--get every duck out\r\nof a flock, up to seven or eight.\r\n\r\nIt is natural for an awkward and blundering wing-shot to love the\r\ndeadliest gun, in order that he may make as good a bag as an expert shot\r\ncan make with a double-barreled gun. It is natural for the hunter who\r\ndoes not care a rap about the extermination of species to love the gun\r\nthat will enable him to kill up to the bag limit, every time he takes\r\nthe field. It is natural for men who don't think, or who think in\r\ncircles, to say \"so long as I observe the lawful bag limit, what\r\ndifference does it make what kind of a gun I use?\"\r\n\r\nIt is natural for the Remington, and Winchester, and Marlin gun-makers\r\nto say, as they do, \"Enforce the laws! Shorten the open seasons! Reduce\r\nthe bag limit, and then it won't matter what guns are used! But,--DON'T\r\ntouch autoloading guns! Don't hamper Inventive Genius!\"\r\n\r\nIs it not high time for American sportsmen to cease taking their moral\r\nprinciples and their codes of ethics from the gun-makers?\r\n\r\nHere is a question that I would like to put before every hunter of game\r\nin America:\r\n\r\nIn view of the alarming scarcity of game, in view of the impending\r\nextermination of species by legal hunting, can any high-minded\r\n_sportsman_, can any _good citizen_ either sell a machine shot-gun or\r\nuse one in hunting?\r\n\r\nA gentleman is incapable of taking an unfair advantage of any wild\r\ncreature; therefore a gentleman cannot use punt guns for ducks, dynamite\r\nfor game fish, or automatic or pump guns in bird-shooting. The machine\r\nguns and \"silencers\" are grossly unfair, and like gang-hooks, nets and\r\ndynamite for trout and bass, their use in hunting must everywhere be\r\nprohibited by law. Times have changed, and the lines for protection must\r\nbe more tightly drawn.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CHAMPION GAME SLAUGHTER CASE\r\nOne Hour's Slaughter (218 Geese) With Two Automatic Shot-Guns]\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court of Pennsylvania (Judge Orlady) has decided that the\r\nPennsylvania law against the use of automatic guns in hunting is\r\nentirely constitutional, because every state has a right to say how its\r\ngame may and may not be killed.\r\n\r\nIt is up to the American People to say _now_ whether their wild life\r\nshall be slaughtered by machinery, or not.\r\n\r\nIf they are willing that it should be, then let us be consistent and\r\nsay--away with all \"conservation!\" The game conservators can endure a\r\ngameless and birdless continent quite as well as the average citizen\r\ncan.\r\n\r\nHOW THEY WORK.--There are a few apologists for the automatic and pump\r\nguns who cheerfully say, \"So long as the bag limit is observed what\r\ndifference does it make how the birds are killed?\"\r\n\r\nIt is strange that a conscientious man should ask such a question, when\r\nthe answer is apparent.\r\n\r\nWe reply, \"The difference is that an automatic or pump gun will kill\r\nfully twice as many waterfowl as a double-barrel, _if not more_; and _it\r\nis highly undesirable that every gunner should get the bag limit of\r\nbirds, or any number near it_! The birds can not stand it. Moreover,\r\n_the best states for ducks and geese have no bag limits on those birds_!\"\r\nTo-day, on Currituck Sound, for example, the market hunters are killing\r\nall the waterfowl they can sell. On Marsh Island, Louisiana, one man has\r\nkilled 369 ducks in one day, and another market gunner killed 430 in one\r\nday.\r\n\r\nThe automatic and the \"pump\" shot-guns are the favorite weapons of the\r\ngame-hog who makes a specialty of geese and ducks. It is no uncommon\r\nthing for a gunner who shoots a machine gun to get, with one gun, as\r\nhigh as _eight_ birds out of one flock. A man who has himself done this\r\nhas told me so.\r\n\r\n_The Champion Game-Slaughter Case_.--Here is a story from California\r\nthat is no fairy tale. It was published, most innocently, in a western\r\nmagazine, with the illustration that appears herewith, and in which\r\nplease notice the automatic shot-gun:\r\n\r\n\"February 5th, I and a friend were at one of the Glenn County Club's\r\ncamps.... Neither of us having ever had the pleasure of shooting over\r\nlive decoys, we were anxious, and could hardly wait for the sport to\r\ncommence. On arriving at the scene we noticed holes which had been dug\r\nin the ground, just large enough for a man to crawl into. These holes\r\nwere used for hiding places, and were deep enough so the sportsmen would\r\nbe entirely out of sight of the game. The birds are so wild that to move\r\na finger will frighten them....\r\n\r\n\"The decoys are wild geese which had been crippled and tamed for this\r\npurpose. They are placed inside of silk net fences which are located on\r\neach side of the holes dug for hiding places. These nets are the color\r\nof the ground and it is impossible for the wild geese flying overhead to\r\ndetect the difference.\r\n\r\n\"After we had investigated everything the expert caller and owner of the\r\noutfit exclaimed: 'Into your holes!'\r\n\r\n\"We noticed in the distance a flock of geese coming. Our caller in a few\r\nseconds had their attention, and they headed towards our decoys. Soon\r\nthey were directly over us, but out of easy range of our guns. We were\r\nanxious to shoot, but in obedience to our boss had to keep still, and\r\nsoon noticed that the birds were soaring around and in a short time were\r\nwithin fifteen or twenty feet of us. At that moment we heard the\r\ncommand, 'Punch 'em!' and the bombardment that followed was beyond\r\nimagining. _We had fired five shots apiece and found we had bagged ten\r\ngeese from this one flock_.\r\n\r\n\"At the end of one hour's shooting we had 218 birds to our credit and\r\nwere out of ammunition.\r\n\r\n\"On finding that no more shells were in our pits we took our dead geese\r\nto the camp and returned with a new supply of ammunition. We remained in\r\nthe pits during the entire day. When the sun had gone behind the\r\nmountains we summed up our kill and _it amounted to 450 geese_!\r\n\r\n\"The picture shown with this article gives a view of _the first hour's\r\nshoot_. A photograph would have been taken of the remainder of the\r\nshoot, but it being warm weather the birds had to be shipped at once in\r\norder to keep them from spoiling.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SLAUGHTERED ACCORDING TO LAW\r\nA Result of a Faulty System. Such Pictures as this are Very Common in\r\nSportsmen's Magazines Note the Automatic Gun]\r\n\r\n\"Supper was then eaten, after which we were driven back to Willows; both\r\nagreeing that it was one of the greatest days of sport we ever had, and\r\nwishing that we might, through the courtesy of the Glenn County Goose\r\nClub, have another such day. C.H.B.\"\r\n\r\nAnother picture was published in a Canadian magazine, illustrating a\r\nstory from which I quote:\r\n\r\n\"I fixed the decoys, hid my boat and took my position in the blind. My\r\nman started his work with a will and hustled the ducks out of every\r\ncove, inlet or piece of marsh for two miles around. I had barely time to\r\nslip the cartridges into my guns--_one a double and the other a five\r\nshot automatic_--when I saw a brace of birds coming toward me. They\r\nsailed in over my decoys. I rose to the occasion, and the leader\r\nup-ended and tumbled in among the decoys. The other bird, unable to stop\r\nquick enough, came directly over me. He closed his wings and struck the\r\nground in the rear of the blind.\r\n\r\n\"More and more followed. Sometimes they came singly, and then in twos\r\nand threes. I kept busy and attended to each bird as quickly as\r\npossible. Whenever there was a lull in the flight I went out in the boat\r\nand picked up the dead, leaving the wounded to take chances with any\r\ngunner lucky enough to catch them in open and smooth water. A bird handy\r\nin the air is worth two wounded ones in the water. _Twice I took six\r\ndead birds out of the water for seven shots, and both guns empty_.\r\n\r\n\"The ball thus opened, the birds commenced to move in all directions.\r\nUntil the morning's flight was over I was kept busy pumping lead, _first\r\nwith the 10, then with the automatic_, reloading, picking up the dead,\r\netc.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the reader will observe that the harmless, innocent, inoffensive\r\nautomatic shot gun, that \"don't matter if you enforce the bag limit,\"\r\nfigures prominently in both stories and both photographs.\r\n\r\n_A Story of Two Pump Guns and Geese_:--It comes from Aberdeen, S.D.\r\n(Sand Lake), in the spring of 1911. Mr. J.J. Humphrey tells it, in\r\n_Outdoor Life_ magazine for July, 1911.\r\n\r\n\"Smith and I were about a hundred yards from them [the flock of Canada\r\ngeese], when Murphy scared them. They rose in a dense mass and came\r\ndirectly between Smith and me. We were about gunshot distance apart, and\r\nthey were not over thirty feet in the air when we opened up on them with\r\nour pump guns and No. 5 shot. When the smoke cleared away and we had\r\nrounded up the cripples we found we had twenty-one geese. I have heard\r\nof bigger killings out in this country, but never positively knew of\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\nSo then: _those two gunners averaged 10-1/2 wild geese per pump gun out\r\nof one flock_! And yet there are wise and reflective sportsmen who say,\r\n\"What difference does the kind of gun make so long as you live up to the\r\nlaw?\"\r\n\r\nI think that the pump and automatic guns make about 75 _per-cent of\r\ndifference, against the game_; that is all!\r\n\r\nThe number of shot-guns now in use in the United States is almost beyond\r\nbelief. About six years ago a gentleman interested in the manufacture of\r\nsuch weapons informed me, and his statement has never been disputed,\r\nthat _every year_ about 500,000 new shot-guns were sold in the United\r\nStates. The number of shot cartridges annually produced by our four\r\ngreat cartridge companies has been reliably estimated as follows:\r\n\r\nWinchester Arms Co              300,000,000\r\nUnion Metallic Cartridge Co     250,000,000\r\nPeters Cartridge Co             150,000,000\r\nWestern Cartridge Co             75,000,000\r\n                                -----------\r\n                                775,000,000\r\n\r\nWe must stop all the holes in the barrel, or eventually lose all the\r\nwater. No group of bird-slaughterers is entitled to immunity. We will\r\nnot \"limit the bag, and enforce the laws,\" while we permit the makers\r\nand users of autoloading and pump guns to kill at will, as they demand.\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Copy of letter:\r\nNational Association of Audubon Societies\r\nFounded 1901.

It was written to G.O. Shields, March 21, 1906.\r\n\r\n  DEAR SIR:\r\n\r\n  Regarding the use of the automatic shot-gun, would say that I am a\r\n  member of two southern ducking clubs where these guns are used very\r\n  extensively. I have seen a flock of ducks come into a blind where\r\n  one, two, or even three of these guns were in use, and have seen as\r\n  many as eleven shots poured into a single flock.\r\n\r\n  We have considerable poaching on one of these clubs, the territory\r\n  being so extensive that it is impossible to prevent it. We own\r\n  60,000 acres, and these poachers, I am told, nearly all use the\r\n  automatic guns. They frequently kill six or eight ducks out of one\r\n  flock--first taking a raking shot on the water, and then getting in\r\n  the balance of the magazine before the flock is out of range. In\r\n  fact, some of them carry two guns, and are able to discharge a part\r\n  of the second magazine into the same flock.\r\n\r\n  As I told you the other evening, I am not so much against the gun\r\n  when in the hands of gentlemen and real sportsmen, but, on account\r\n  of its terrible possibilities for market hunters, I believe that the\r\n  only safe way is to abolish it entirely, and that the better class\r\n  should be willing to give up this weapon as being the only means of\r\n  putting a stop to this willful game slaughter.\r\n\r\n  Very truly yours,\r\n\r\n  ARTHUR ROBINSON.\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nHOW GENTLEMEN SPORTSMEN REGARD AUTOMATIC AND PUMP GUNS\r\n\r\n\r\nEach one of the following organizations, chiefly clubs of gentlemen\r\nsportsmen, have adopted strong resolutions condemning the use of\r\nautomatic guns in hunting, and either requesting or recommending the\r\nenactment of laws against their use:\r\n\r\nNew York Zoological Society ...

The weapon\r\ndischarges all three barrels simultaneously. In the _London Field_, of\r\nDec. 9, 1911, it is described by a writer who also thoughtfully conceals\r\nhis identity under a nom-de-plume. After a trial of 48 shots, the writer\r\ndeclares that \"the 3-barreled is a really practicable weapon,\" and that\r\nwith it one could bag wild-fowl that were quite out of reach of any\r\nshot-gun. Just why a Gatling gun or a Maxim should not be employed for\r\nthe same purpose, the writer fails to state. The use of either would be\r\nquite as sportsmanlike, and as fair to the game. There are great\r\npossibilities in ducking mortars, also.\r\n\r\n_The \"Sunday Gun.\"_--A new weapon of peculiar form and great deadliness\r\nto song birds, has recently come into use. Because of the manner of its\r\nuse, it is known as the \"Sunday gun.\" It is specially adapted to\r\nconcealment on the person. A man could go through a reception with one\r\nof these deadly weapons absolutely concealed under his dress coat! It is\r\na weapon with two barrels, rifle and shot; and it enables the user to\r\nkill anything from a humming-bird up to a deer. What the shot-barrel can\r\nnot kill, the rifle will. It is not a gun that any sportsman would own,\r\nsave as a curiosity, or for target use.\r\n\r\nThe State Ornithologist of Massachusetts, Mr. E.H. Forbush, informs me\r\nthat already the \"Sunday gun\" has become a scourge to the bird life of\r\nthat state. Thousands of them are used by men and boys who live in\r\ncities and towns, and are able to get into the country only on Sundays.\r\nThey conceal them under their coats, on Sunday mornings, go out into the\r\ncountry, and spend the day in shooting small birds and mammals. The dead\r\nbirds are concealed in various pockets, the Sunday gun goes under the\r\ncoat, and at nightfall the guerrilla rides back to the city with an\r\ninnocent smile on his face, as if he had spent a day in harmless\r\nenjoyment of the beauties of nature.\r\n\r\nThe \"Sunday gun\" is on sale everywhere, and it is said to be in use both\r\nby American and Italian killers of song-birds. It weighs only two\r\npounds, eight ounces, and its cost is so trifling that any guerrilla who\r\nwishes one can easily find the money for its purchase. There are in the\r\nUnited States at least a million men and boys quite mean enough to use\r\nthis weapon on song-birds, swallows, woodpeckers, nuthatches, rabbits\r\nand squirrels, and like other criminals, hide both weapon and loot in\r\ntheir clothing. So long as this gun is in circulation, no small bird is\r\nsafe, at any season, near any city or town.\r\n\r\nNow, what are the People going to do about it?\r\n\r\nMy recommendation is that each state enact a law in the following terms:\r\n\r\nBe it enacted, etc.--That from and after the passage of this act it\r\nshall be unlawful for any person to use in hunting, or to carry\r\nconcealed on the person, any shotgun, or rifle, or combination of\r\nshotgun and rifle, with a barrel or barrels less than twenty-eight\r\ninches in length, or with a skeleton stock fixed on a hinge.\r\n\r\nThe carrying of any rifle or shotgun concealed on the person shall\r\nconstitute a felony.\r\n\r\nThe penalties for hunting with any gun specially adapted to concealment\r\nshould be not less than $50 fine or two months imprisonment at hard\r\nlabor, and the carrying of such weapons concealed should be $100 or four\r\nmonths at hard labor.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, we wonder what will be the next devilish device for the\r\ndestruction of wild life that American inventive genius will produce.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE \"SUNDAY GUN!\"\r\nA Deadly Combination of Concealable Rifle-and-Shot-Gun.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE WILDERNESS OF NORTH AMERICA (SHADED) AND THE ARCTIC\r\nPRAIRIES, WELL STOCKED WITH BIG GAME]\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nTHE PRESENT AND FUTURE OF NORTH AMERICAN BIG GAME\r\n\r\n\r\nThe subject of this chapter opens up a vast field of facts and\r\nconclusions, quite broad enough to fill a whole volume. In the space at\r\nour disposal here it is possible to offer only a summary of the subject,\r\nwithout attempting to prove our statements by the production of detailed\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\nTo say that all over the world, the large land mammals are being\r\ndestroyed more rapidly than they are breeding, would not be literally\r\ntrue, for the reason that there are yet many areas that are almost\r\nuntouched by the destroying hand of civilized man. It is true, however,\r\nthat all the unspoiled areas rapidly are growing fewer and smaller. It\r\nis also true that in all the regions of the earth that are easily\r\npenetrable by civilized man, the wild life is being killed faster than\r\nit breeds, and of necessity it is disappearing. This is why the British\r\nare now so urgently bestirring themselves to create game preserves in\r\nall the countries that they own.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the inexorable laws of Nature, to which I know of not one\r\nexception, that large hoofed animals which live on open plains, on open\r\nmountains, or in regions that are thinly forested, always are easily\r\nfound and easily exterminated. All such animals have a weak hold on\r\nlife. This is because it is so difficult for them to hide, and so very\r\neasy for man to creep up within the killing range of modern, high-power,\r\nlong-range rifles. Is it not pitiful to think of animals like the\r\ncaribou, moose, white sheep and bear trying to survive on the naked\r\nridges and bald mountains of Yukon Territory and Alaska! With a modern\r\nrifle, the greatest duffer on earth can creep up within killing distance\r\nof any of the big game of the North.\r\n\r\nThe gray wolf is practically the only large animal that is able to hide\r\nsuccessfully and survive in the treeless regions of the North; but his\r\nroom is always preferable to his company, because he, too, is a\r\ndestroyer of big game.\r\n\r\nI am tempted to try to map out roughly what are to-day the unopened and\r\nundestroyed wild haunts of big game in North America. In doing this,\r\nhowever, I warn the reader not to be deceived into thinking that because\r\ngame still exists in those regions, those areas therefore constitute a\r\npermanent preserve and safe breeding-ground for large mammals. That is\r\nvery, very far from being the case. The further \"opening up\" of the\r\nwilderness areas, as I shall call them for convenience, can and surely\r\nwill quickly wipe out their big game; for throughout nine-tenths of\r\nthose areas it holds to life by very slender threads.\r\n\r\nTo-day the unopened and undestroyed wilderness areas of North America,\r\nwherein large mammals still live in a normal wild state, are in general\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\nTHE ARCTIC BARREN GROUNDS, or Arctic Prairies, north of the limit of\r\ntrees, embracing the Barren Grounds of northern Canada, the great arctic\r\narchipelago, Ellesmere, Melville and Grant Lands and Greenland. This\r\nregion is the home of the musk-ox and three species of arctic caribou.\r\n\r\nTHE ALASKA-YUKON REGION, inhabited by the moose, white mountain sheep,\r\nmountain goat, four species of caribou, and half a dozen species of\r\nAlaska brown, grizzly and black bears.\r\n\r\nNORTHERN ONTARIO, QUEBEC, LABRADOR AND NEWFOUNDLAND, inhabited by moose,\r\nwoodland caribou, white-tailed deer and black bear.\r\n\r\nBRITISH COLUMBIA, inhabited by a magnificent big-game fauna embracing\r\nthe moose, elk, caribou of two species, white sheep, black sheep,\r\nbig-horn sheep, mule deer, white-tailed deer, mountain goat, grizzly,\r\nblack and inland white bears.\r\n\r\nTHE SIERRA MADRE OF MEXICO, containing jaguar, puma, _grizzly_ and black\r\nbears, mule deer, white-tailed deer, antelope, mountain sheep and\r\npeccaries.\r\n\r\nI have necessarily omitted all those regions of the United States and\r\nCanada that still contain a remnant of big game, but have been literally\r\n\"shot to pieces\" by gunners.\r\n\r\nIn the United States and southern Canada there are about fifteen\r\nlocalities which contain a supply of big game sufficient that a\r\nconscientious sportsman might therein hunt and kill one head per year\r\nwith a clear conscience. _All others should be closed for five years_!\r\nHere is the list of availables; and regarding it there will be about as\r\nmany opinions as there are big-game sportsmen:\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nHUNTING GROUNDS IN AND NEAR THE UNITED STATES AND SOUTHERN CANADA\r\nWHEREIN IT IS RIGHT TO HUNT BIG GAME\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MAINE WOODS: Well stocked with white-tailed deer.\r\n\r\nNEW BRUNSWICK: Well stocked with moose; a few caribou, deer and black\r\nbear.\r\n\r\nWHITE MOUNTAINS OF NEW HAMPSHIRE AND VERMONT: For deer.\r\n\r\nTHE ADIRONDACKS, NEW YORK: Well stocked with white-tailed deer, only.\r\n\r\nPENNSYLVANIA MOUNTAINS: Contain many deer and black bears, and soon will\r\ncontain more.\r\n\r\nNORTHERN MINNESOTA: Deer and moose.\r\n\r\nNORTHERN MICHIGAN AND WISCONSIN: White-tailed deer.\r\n\r\nNORTHWESTERN WYOMING: Thousands of elk in fall and winter; a few deer,\r\ngrizzly and black bears, but no sheep that it would be right to kill.\r\n\r\nWESTERN AND SOUTHWESTERN MONTANA: Elk in season, mule and white-tail\r\ndeer; no sheep that it would be right to kill.\r\n\r\nNORTHWESTERN MONTANA: Mule and white-tailed deer, only. No sheep, bear,\r\nmoose, elk or antelope _to kill_!\r\n\r\nWYOMING, EAST OF YELLOWSTONE PARK: A few elk, by migration from the\r\nPark; a few deer, and bear of two species.\r\n\r\nNORTHERN WOODS OF ONTARIO AND QUEBEC: Moose; deer.\r\n\r\nSOUTHERN BRITISH COLUMBIA: Goat, a few sheep and deer; grizzly bear.\r\nMoose, caribou and elk should not be killed.\r\n\r\nNORTHERN BRITISH COLUMBIA: Six fine species of big game.\r\n\r\nNORTHWESTERN ALBERTA: Grizzly bear, big-horn and mountain goat.\r\n\r\nUnder existing conditions I regard the above-named hunting grounds as\r\n_nearly all_ in which it is right or fair for big-game hunting now to be\r\npermitted, even on a strict basis. Nearly all others should immediately\r\nbe closed, for large game, for ten years.\r\n\r\nOf course such a proceeding, if carried into effect, would provoke loud\r\nprotests from sportsmen, gunners, game-hogs, pot-hunters and others; but\r\nI only wish to high heaven that we had the power to carry such a program\r\nas that into effect! _Then we would see some game in ten years_; and our\r\ngrand-children would thank us for some real big-game protection at a\r\ncritical period.\r\n\r\nExcept in the few localities above-mentioned, I regard the big-game\r\nsituation in the United States and southern Canada as particularly\r\ndesperate. Unless there is an immediate and complete revolution in this\r\ncountry from an era of slaughter to an era of preservation, as sure as\r\nthe sun rises on the morrow, outside of the hard and fast game\r\npreserves, and places like Maine and the Adirondacks, this generation of\r\nAmericans and near-Americans will live to see our country _swept clean\r\nof big game_!\r\n\r\nTwo years ago, I did not believe this; but I do now. It is impossible to\r\nexaggerate the wide extent or the seriousness of this situation. In a\r\ncountry where any and every individual can rise and bluster,\r\n\"I'm-just-as-good-as-_you_-are,\" and bellow for his \"rights\" as a\r\n\"tax-payer,\" there is no stopping the millions who kill whenever there\r\nis an open season. And to many Americans, no right is dearer than the\r\nright to kill the game which by even the commonest law of equity\r\nbelongs, not to the shooter exclusively, but partly to two thousand\r\nother persons who don't shoot at all!\r\n\r\nUnless we come to an \"About, face!\" in quick time, all our big game\r\noutside the preserves is doomed to sure and quick extermination. This is\r\nnot an individual opinion, merely: it is a _fact_; and a hundred\r\nthousand men know it to be such.\r\n\r\nLast winter (1911-12), because the deer of Montana were driven by cold\r\nand hunger out of the mountains and far down into the ranchmen's\r\nvalleys, eleven thousand of them were ruthlessly slaughtered. State\r\nGame Warden Avare says that often heads of families took out as many\r\nlicenses as there were persons in the family, and the whole quota was\r\nkilled. Such people deserve to go deerless into the future; but we can\r\nnot allow them to rob innocent people.\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nOUR SPECIES OF BIG GAME\r\n\r\nTHE PRONG-HORNED ANTELOPE, unique and wonderful, will be one of _the\r\nfirst species of North American big game to become totally extinct_. We\r\nmay see this come to pass within twenty years. They can not be bred in\r\nprotection, _save in very large fenced ranges_. They are delicate,\r\ncapricious, and easily upset. They die literally \"at the drop of a hat.\"\r\nThey are quite subject to actinomycosis (lumpy-jaw), which in wild\r\nanimals is incurable.\r\n\r\nAlready all the states that possess wild antelope, except Nevada, have\r\npassed laws giving that species long close seasons; which is highly\r\ncreditable to the states that have done their duty. Nevada must get in\r\nline at the next session of her legislature!\r\n\r\nIn 1908, Dr. T.S. Palmer published in his annual report of \"Progress in\r\nGame Protection\" the following in regard to the prong-horned antelope:\r\n\r\n\"Antelope are still found in diminished numbers in fourteen western\r\nstates. A considerable number were killed during the year in Montana,\r\nwhere the species seems to have suffered more than elsewhere since the\r\nseason was opened in 1907.\r\n\r\n\"A striking illustration of the decrease of the antelope is afforded by\r\nColorado. In 1898 the State Warden estimated that there were 25,000 in\r\nthe state, whereas in 1908 the Game Commissioner places the number at\r\nonly 2,000. The total number of antelope now in the United States\r\nprobably does not exceed 17,000, distributed approximately as follows:\r\n\r\nColorado    2,000         Yellowstone Park    2,000\r\nIdaho         200         Other States        2,000\r\nMontana     4,000                             -----\r\nNew Mexico  1,300         Saskatchewan        2,000\r\nOregon      1,500                             -----\r\nWyoming     4,000                            19,000\r\n\r\nTo-day (1912), Dr. Palmer says the total number of antelope is less than\r\nit was in 1908, and in spite of protection the number is steadily\r\ndiminishing. This is indeed serious news. The existing bands, already\r\nsmall, are steadily growing smaller. The antelope are killed lawlessly,\r\nand the crimes of such slaughter are, in nearly every instance,\r\nsuccessfully concealed.\r\n\r\nPreviously, we have based strong hopes for the preservation of the\r\nantelope species on the herd in the Yellowstone Park, but those animals\r\nare vanishing fearfully fast. In 1906, Dr. Palmer reported that \"About\r\nfifteen hundred antelope came down to the feeding grounds near the\r\nhaystacks in the vicinity of Gardiner.\" In 1908 the Yellowstone Park\r\nwas credited with two thousand head. _To-day, the number alive, by\r\nactual count, is only five hundred head_; and this after twenty-five\r\nyears of protection! Where have the others gone? This shows, alas! that\r\nperpetual close seasons can not _always_ bring back the vanished\r\nthousands of game!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PRONG-HORNED ANTELOPE]\r\n\r\nHere is a reliable report (June 29, 1912) regarding the prong-horned\r\nantelope in Lower California, from E.W. Nelson: \"Antelope formerly\r\nranged over nearly the entire length of Lower California, but are now\r\ngone from a large part of their ancient range, and their steadily\r\ndecreasing numbers indicate their early extinction throughout the\r\npeninsula.\"\r\n\r\nIn captivity the antelope is exasperatingly delicate and short-lived. It\r\nhas about as much stamina as a pet monkey. As an exhibition animal in\r\nzoological gardens and parks it is a failure; for it always looks faded,\r\nspiritless and dead, like a stuffed animal ready to be thrown into the\r\ndiscard. Zoologists can not save the prong-horn species save at long\r\nrange, in preserves so huge that the sensitive little beast will not\r\neven suspect that it is confined.\r\n\r\nTwo serious attempts have been made to transplant and acclimatize the\r\nantelope--in the Wichita National Bison Range, in Oklahoma, and in the\r\nMontana Bison Range, at Ravalli. In 1911 the Boone and Crockett Club\r\nprovided a fund which defrayed the expenses of shipping from the\r\nYellowstone Park a small nucleus herd to each of those ranges. Eight\r\nwere sent to the Wichita Range, of which five arrived alive. Of the\r\nseven sent to the Montana Range, four arrived alive and were duly set\r\nfree. While it seems a pity to take specimens from the Yellowstone Park\r\nherd, the disagreeable fact is that there is no other source on which to\r\ndraw for breeding stock.\r\n\r\nThe Provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan, in Canada, still permit the\r\nhunting and killing of antelope; which is wholly and entirely wrong.\r\n\r\nTHE BIG-HORN SHEEP.--Of North American big game, the big-horn of the\r\nRockies will be, after the antelope, the next species to become extinct\r\noutside of protected areas. In the United States that event is fast\r\napproaching. It is far nearer than even the big-game sportsmen realize.\r\nThere are to-day only two localities in the four states that still\r\n_think_ they have killable sheep, in which it is worth while to go\r\nsheep-hunting. One is in Montana, and the other is in Wyoming. In the\r\nUnited States a really big, creditable ram may now be regarded as an\r\nimpossibility. There are now perhaps half a dozen guides who can find\r\nkillable sheep in our country, but the game is nearly always young rams,\r\nunder five years of age.\r\n\r\nThat Wyoming, Montana, Idaho and Washington still continue to permit\r\nsheep slaughter is outrageous. Their answer is that \"The sportsmen won't\r\nstand for stopping it altogether.\" I will add:--and the great mass of\r\npeople are too criminally indifferent to take a hand in the matter, and\r\n_do their duty_ regardless of the men of blood.\r\n\r\nThe seed stock of big-horn sheep now alive in the United States\r\naggregates a pitifully small number. After twenty-five years of unbroken\r\nprotection in Colorado, Dillon Wallace estimates, after an investigation\r\non the ground, that the state possesses perhaps thirty-five hundred\r\nhead. He credits Montana and Wyoming with five hundred each--which I\r\nthink is far too liberal a number. I do not believe that either of those\r\nstates contains more than one hundred unprotected sheep, at the very\r\nutmost limit. If there are more, where are they?\r\n\r\nIn the Yellowstone Park there are 210 head, safe and sound, and slowly\r\nincreasing. I can not understand why they have not increased more\r\nrapidly than they have. In Glacier Park, now under permanent protection,\r\nthree guides on Lake McDonald, in 1910, estimated the number of sheep at\r\nseven hundred. Idaho has in her rugged Bitter Root and Clearwater\r\nMountains and elsewhere, a remnant of possibly two hundred sheep, and\r\nWashington has only what chemists call \"a trace.\" It has recently been\r\ndiscovered that California still contains a few sheep, and in\r\nsouthwestern Nevada there are a few more.\r\n\r\nIn Utah, the big-horn species is probably quite extinct. In Arizona,\r\nthere are a few very small bands, very widely scattered. They are in the\r\nSanta Catalina Mountains, the Grand Canyon country, the Gila Range, and\r\nthe Quitovaquita Mountains, near Sonoyta. But who can protect from\r\nslaughter those Arizona sheep? Absolutely no one! They are too few and\r\ntoo widely scattered for the game wardens to keep in touch with them.\r\nThe \"prospectors\" have them entirely at their mercy, and the world well\r\nknows what prospectors' \"mercy\" to edible big game looks like on the\r\nground. It leads straight to the frying-pan, the coyotes and the\r\nvultures.\r\n\r\nThe Lower California peninsula contains about five hundred mountain\r\nsheep, without the slightest protection save low, desert mountains, heat\r\nand thirst. But that is no real protection whatever. Those sheep are too\r\nfine to be butchered the way they have been, and now are being\r\nbutchered. In 1908 I strongly called the attention of the Mexican\r\nGovernment to the situation; and the Departmento de Fomento secured the\r\nissue of an executive order forbidding the hunting of any big game in\r\nLower California without the written authority of the government. I am\r\nsure, however, that owing to the political and military upheaval it\r\nnever stopped the slaughter of sheep. In such easy mountains as those of\r\nLower California, it is a simple matter to exterminate quickly all the\r\nmountain sheep that they possess. The time for President Madero and his\r\ncabinet to inaugurate serious protective measures has fully arrived.\r\n\r\nBoth British Columbia and Alberta have even yet fine herds of big-horn,\r\nand we can count three large game preserves in which they are protected.\r\nThey are Goat Mountain Park (East Kootenay district, between the Elk and\r\nBull Rivers); the Rocky Mountains Park, near Banff, and Waterton Lakes\r\nPark, in the southwestern corner of Alberta.\r\n\r\nIn view of the number of men who desire to hunt them, the bag limit on\r\nbig-horn rams in British Columbia and Alberta still is too liberal, by\r\nhalf. One ram per year for one man is _quite enough_; quite as much so\r\nas one moose is the limit everywhere. To-day \"a big, old ram\" is\r\nregarded by sportsmen as a much more desirable and creditable trophy\r\nthan a moose; because moose-killing is easy, and the bagging of an old\r\nmountain ram in real mountains requires five times as much effort and\r\nskill.\r\n\r\nThe splendid high and rugged mountains of British Columbia and Alberta\r\nform an ideal home for the big-horn (and mountain goat), and it would be\r\nan international calamity for that region to be denuded of its splendid\r\nbig game. With resolute intent and judicial treatment that region can\r\nremain a rich and valuable hunting ground for five hundred years to\r\ncome. Under falsely \"liberal\" laws, it can be shot into a state of\r\ncomplete desolation within ten years, or even less.\r\n\r\nOTHER MOUNTAIN SHEEP.--In northern British Columbia, north of Iskoot\r\nLake, there lies a tremendous region, extending to the Arctic Ocean, and\r\ncomprehending the whole area between the Rocky Mountain continental\r\ndivide and the waters of the Pacific. Over the southern end of this\r\ngreat wilderness ranges the black mountain sheep, and throughout the\r\nremainder, with many sheepless intervals, is scattered the white\r\nmountain sheep.\r\n\r\nOwing to the immensity of this wilderness, the well-nigh total lack of\r\nrailroads and also of navigable waters, excepting the Yukon, it will not\r\nbe thoroughly \"opened up\" for a quarter of a century. The few resolute\r\nand pneumonia-proof sportsmen who can wade into the country, pulling\r\nboats through icy-cold mountain streams, are not going to devastate\r\nthose millions of mountains of their big game. The few head of game\r\nwhich sportsmen can and will take out of the great northwestern\r\nwilderness during the next twenty-five years will hardly be missed from\r\nthe grand total, even though a few easily-accessible localities are shot\r\nout. It is the deadly resident trappers, hunters and prospectors who\r\nmust be feared! And again,--_who_ can control them? Can any wilderness\r\ngovernment on earth make it possible? Therefore, _in time, even the\r\ngreat wilderness will be denuded of big game_. This is absolutely fixed\r\nand certain; for within much less than another century, every square rod\r\nof it will have been gone over by prospectors, lumbermen, trappers and\r\nskin-hunters, and raked again and again with fine-toothed combs. A\r\nrailway line to Dawson, the Copper River and Cook Inlet is to-day merely\r\nthe next thing to expect, after Canada's present railway program has\r\nbeen wrought out.\r\n\r\nYes, indeed! In time the wilderness will be opened up, and the big game\r\nwill _all_ be shot out, save from the protected areas.\r\n\r\nTHE MOUNTAIN GOAT.--Even yet, this species is not wholly extinct in the\r\nUnited States. It survives in Glacier Park, Montana, and the number\r\nestimated in that region by three guide friends is too astoundingly\r\nlarge to mention.\r\n\r\nThis animal is much more easily killed than the big-horn. Its white coat\r\nrenders it fatally conspicuous at long range during the best hunting\r\nseason; it is almost devoid of fear, and it takes altogether too many\r\nchances on man. Thanks to the rage for sheep horns, the average\r\nsportsman's view-point regarding wild life ranks a goat head about six\r\ncontours below \"old ram\" heads, in desirability. Furthermore, most\r\nguides regard the flesh of the goat as almost unfit for use as food, and\r\nfar inferior to that of the big-horn. These reasons, taken together,\r\nrender the goats much less persecuted by the sportsmen, ranchmen and\r\nprospectors who enter the home of the two species. It was because of\r\nthis indifference toward goats that in 1905 Mr. John M. Phillips and his\r\nparty saw 243 goats in thirty days in Goat Mountain Park, and only\r\nfourteen sheep.\r\n\r\nUnless the preferences of western sportsmen and gunners change very\r\nconsiderably, the coast mountains of the great northwestern wilderness\r\nwill remain stocked with wild mountain goats until long after the last\r\nbig-horn has been shot to death. Fortunately, the skin of the mountain\r\ngoat has no commercial value. I think it was in 1887 that I purchased,\r\nin Denver, 150 nicely tanned skins of our wild white goat _at fifty\r\ncents each_! They were wanted for the first exhibit ever made to\r\nillustrate the extermination of American large mammals, and they were\r\nshown at the Louisville Exposition. It must have cost the price of those\r\nskins to tan them; and I was pleased to know that some one lost money on\r\nthe venture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration MAP OF THE FORMER AND EXISTING RANGES OF THE AMERICAN ELK\r\nFrom \"Life History of Northern Animals,\" Copyright 1909 by E.T. Seton]\r\n\r\nAt present the mountain goat extends from north-western Montana to the\r\nhead of Cook Inlet, but it is not found in the interior or in the Yukon\r\nvalley. Whenever man decides that the species has lived long enough, he\r\ncan quickly and easily exterminate it. It is one of the most picturesque\r\nand interesting wild animals on this continent, and there is not the\r\nslightest excuse for shooting it, save as a specimen of natural history.\r\nLike the antelope, it is so unique as a natural curiosity that it\r\ndeserves to be taken out of the ranks of animals that are regularly\r\npursued as game.\r\n\r\nTHE ELK.--The story of the progressive extermination of the American\r\nelk, or wapiti, covers practically the same territory as the tragedy of\r\nthe American bison--one-third of the mainland of North America. The\r\nformer range of the elk covered absolutely the garden ground of our\r\ncontinent, omitting the arid region. Its boundary extended from central\r\nMassachusetts to northern Georgia, southern Illinois, northern Texas and\r\ncentral New Mexico, central Arizona, the whole Rocky Mountain region up\r\nto the Peace River, and Manitoba. It skipped the arid country west of\r\nthe Rockies, but it embraced practically the whole Pacific slope from\r\ncentral California to the north end of Vancouver Island. Mr. Seton\r\nroughly calculated the former range of _canadensis_ at two and a half\r\nmillion square miles, and adds: \"We are safe, therefore, in believing\r\nthat in those days there may have been ten million head.\"\r\n\r\nThe range of the elk covered a magnificent domain. The map prepared by\r\nMr. Ernest T. Seton, after twenty years of research, is the last word on\r\nthe subject. It appears on page 43, Vol. I, of his great work, \"Life\r\nHistories of Northern Animals,\" and I have the permission of author and\r\npublisher to reproduce it here, as an object lesson in wild-animal\r\nextermination. Mr. Seton recognizes (for convenience, only?) four forms\r\nof American elk, two of which, _C. nannodes_ and _occidentalis_, still\r\nexist on the Pacific Coast. The fourth, _Cervus merriami_, was\r\nundoubtedly a valid species. It lived in Arizona and New Mexico, but\r\nbecame totally extinct near the beginning of the present century.\r\n\r\nIn 1909 Mr. Seton published in the work referred to above a remarkably\r\nclose estimate of the number of elk then alive in North America.\r\nRecently, a rough count--the first ever made--of the elk in and around\r\nthe Yellowstone Park, revealed the real number of that largest\r\ncontingent. By taking those results, and Mr. Seton's figures for elk\r\noutside the United States, we obtain the following very close\r\napproximation of the wild elk alive in North America in 1912:\r\n\r\nLOCALITY                         NUMBER             AUTHORITY\r\n\r\nYellowstone Park and vicinity    47,000     U.S. Biological Survey.\r\nIdaho (permanently),                600\r\nWashington                        1,200 Game Warden Chris.

Naturally, the largest animals were the ones most\r\neagerly sought by the meat-hungry pioneers, and the elk and bison were\r\nthe first game species to disappear. The colonists believed in the\r\nsurvival of the fittest, and we are glad that they did. The one thing\r\nthat a hungry pioneer cannot withstand is--temptation--in a form that\r\nembraces five hundred pounds of succulent flesh. And let it not be\r\nsupposed that in the eastern states there were only a few elk. The\r\nPennsylvania salt licks were crowded with them, and the early writers\r\ndescribe them as existing in \"immense bands\" and \"great numbers.\"\r\n\r\nOf course it is impossible for wild animals of great size to exist in\r\ncountries that are covered with farms, villages and people. Under such\r\nconditions the wild and the tame cannot harmonize. It is a fact,\r\nhowever, that elk could exist and thrive in every national forest and\r\nnational park in our country, and also on uncountable hundreds of\r\nthousands of rough, wild, timbered hills and mountains such as exist in\r\nprobably twenty-five different states. There is no reason, except man's\r\nshort-sighted greed and foolishness, why there are not to-day one\r\nhundred thousand elk living in the Allegheny Mountains, furnishing each\r\nyear fifty thousand three-year-old males as free food for the people.\r\n\r\nThe trouble is,--the greedy habitants _could not_ be induced to kill\r\nonly the three-year-old-males, in the fall, and let the cows, calves and\r\nbreeding bulls alone! By sensible management the Rocky Mountains, the\r\nSierra Nevadas and the Coast Range would support enough wild elk to feed\r\na million people. But we Americans seem utterly incapable of maintaining\r\nanywhere from decade to decade a large and really valuable supply of\r\nwild game. Outside the Yellowstone Park and northwestern Wyoming, the\r\nAmerican elk exists only in small bands--mere remnants and samples of\r\nthe millions we could and should have.\r\n\r\n_If_ they could be protected, and the surplus presently killed according\r\nto some rational, working system, then _every national forest in the\r\nUnited States should be stocked with elk_! In view of the awful cost of\r\nbeef (to-day 10-1/2 cents per pound in Chicago _on the hoof_!), it is\r\nhigh time that we should consider the raising of game on the public\r\ndomain on such lines that it would form a valuable food supply without\r\ndiminishing the value of the forests.\r\n\r\nJust now (1912) the American people are sorely puzzled by a remarkable\r\nelk problem that each winter is presented for solution in the Jackson\r\nHole country, Wyoming. Driven southward by the deep snows of winter, the\r\nelk thousands that in summer graze and grow fat in the Yellowstone Park\r\nmarch down into Jackson Hole, to find in those valleys less snow and\r\nmore food. Now, it happens that the best and most of the former winter\r\ngrazing grounds of the elk are covered by fenced ranches! As a result,\r\nthe elk that strive to winter there, about fifteen thousand head, are\r\neach winter threatened with starvation; and during three or four winters\r\nof recent date, an aggregate of several thousand calves, weak yearlings\r\nand weakened cows perished of hunger. The winters of 1908, 1909 and 1910\r\nwere progressively more and more severe; and 1911 saw about 2500 deaths,\r\n(S.N. Leek).\r\n\r\nIn 1909-10, the State of Wyoming spent $7,000 for hay, and fed it to the\r\nstarving elk. In 1911, Wyoming spent $5,000 more, and appealed to\r\nCongress for help. Thanks to the efforts of Senator Lodge and others,\r\nCongress instantly responded with a splendid emergency appropriation of\r\n$20,000, partly for the purpose of feeding the elk, and also to meet the\r\ncost of transporting elsewhere as many of the elk as it might seem best\r\nto move. The starving of the elk ceased with 1911.\r\n\r\n_Outdoor Life_ magazine (Denver, Colo.) for August, 1912, contains an\r\nexcellent article by Dr. W.B. Shore, entitled, \"Trapping and Shipping\r\nElk.\" I wish I could reprint it entire, for the solid information that\r\nit contains. It gives a clear and comprehensive account of last spring's\r\noperations by the Government and by the state of Montana in capturing\r\nand shipping elk from the Yellowstone Park herd, for the double purpose\r\nof diminishing the elk surplus in the Park and stocking vacant ranges\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe operations were conducted on the same basis as the shipping of\r\ncattle--the corral, the chute, the open car, and the car-load in bulk.\r\nDr. Shore states that the undertaking was really no more difficult than\r\nthe shipping of range cattle; but the presence of a considerable\r\nproportion of young and tender calves, such as are never handled with\r\nbeef cattle, led to 8.8 per cent of deaths in transit. The deaths and\r\nthe percentage are nothing at which to be surprised, when it is\r\nremembered, that the animals had just come through a hard winter, and\r\ntheir natural vitality was at the lowest point of the year.\r\n\r\nThe following is a condensed summary of the results of the work:\r\n\r\n                            Number of   Hours on   Killed or    Died After\r\n         Destination           Elk       Road      Died in Car  Unloading\r\n\r\n1 Car.

Leek, of Jackson Hole, clearly reveal the fact that the herds\r\nnow consist chiefly of cows, calves, yearlings and young bulls with\r\nsmall antlers. In one photograph showing about twenty-five hundred elk,\r\nthere are not visible even half a dozen pairs of antlers that belong to\r\nadult bulls. There should be a hundred! This condition means that the\r\nbest bulls, with the finest heads, are constantly being selected and\r\nkilled by sportsmen and others who want their heads; and the young,\r\nimmature bulls are left to do the breeding that alone will sustain the\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HUNGRY ELK IN JACKSON HOLE, WYOMING\r\nPart of a Herd of About 2,500 Head, being fed on hay, in the Winter of\r\n1910-11 Note the Absence of Adult Bulls. Copyright, 1911, by S.N.\r\nLeek]\r\n\r\nIt is a well-known principle in stock-breeding that sires should be\r\nfully adult, of maximum strength, and in the prime of life. No\r\nstockbreeder in his senses ever thinks of breeding from a youthful,\r\nimmature sire. The result would be weak offspring not up to the\r\nstandard.\r\n\r\nThis inexorable law of inheritance and transmission is just as much a\r\nlaw for the elk, moose and deer of North America as it is for domestic\r\ncattle and horses. If the present conditions in the Wyoming elk herds\r\ncontinue to prevail for several generations, as sure as time goes on we\r\nshall see a marked deterioration in the size and antlers of the elk.\r\n\r\nIf the foundation principles of stock-breeding are correct, then it is\r\nimpossible to maintain any large-mammal species at its zenith of size,\r\nstrength and virility by continuous breeding of the young and immature\r\nmales. By some sportsmen it is believed that through long-continued\r\nkilling of the finest and largest males, the red deer of Europe have\r\nbeen growing smaller; but on that point I am not prepared to offer\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the in-breeding of the elk herds in large open parks and\r\npreserves throughout North America, there are positively _no ill effects\r\nto fear_. Wild animals that are _closely_ confined generation after\r\ngeneration are bound to deteriorate physically; but with healthy wild\r\nanimals living in large open ranges, feeding and breeding naturally, the\r\nin-breeding that occurs produces no deterioration.\r\n\r\nIn the twin certainties of over-population, and deterioration from\r\nexcessive killing of the good sires, we have to face two new problems of\r\nvery decided importance. Nothing short of very radical measures will\r\nprovide a remedy. For the immediate future, I can offer a solution.\r\nWhile it seems almost impossible deliberately to kill females, I think\r\nthat the present is a very exceptional case, and one that compels us to\r\napply the painful remedy that I now propose.\r\n\r\n_Premises_:\r\n\r\n1.--There are at present _too many_ breeding cows in the Yellowstone\r\nherds.\r\n\r\n2.--There are far too few good breeding bulls.\r\n\r\n_Conclusion_:--For five years, entirely prohibit the killing of adult\r\nmale elk, and kill only females, and young males. This would gradually\r\ndiminish the number of calves born each year, by about 2,500, and by the\r\nend of five years it would reduce the number, _and the annual birth_, of\r\nfemales to a figure sufficiently limited that the herds could be\r\nmaintained on existing ranges.\r\n\r\n_Corollary_.--At the end of five years, stop killing females, and kill\r\nonly _young_ males. This plan would permit a large number of bull elk to\r\nmature; and then the largest and strongest animals would do the\r\nbreeding,--just as Nature always intends shall be done.\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nSOUTH AMERICA\r\n\r\nOf all the big-game regions of the earth, South America is the poorest.\r\nOf hoofed game she possesses only a dozen species that are worth the\r\nattention of sportsmen; and like all other animal life in that land of\r\nlittle game, they are desperately hard to find. In South America you\r\nmust work your heart out in order to get either game or specimens that\r\nwill be worth showing.\r\n\r\nAt present, we need not worry about the marsh deer, the pampas deer, the\r\nguemal, or the venado, nor the tapir, jaguar, ocelot and bears. All\r\nthese species are abundantly able to take care of themselves; and to\r\nfind and kill any one of them is a man's task. In Patagonia the natives\r\ndo wastefully slaughter the guanacos; and there are times also when\r\ngreat numbers of guanacos come down in winter to certain mountain lakes,\r\npresumably in search of food, and perish by hundreds through starvation.\r\n(H. Hesketh Prichard.)\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nMEXICO\r\n\r\nAbout ten years more will see the extinction of the mountain sheep of\r\nLower California,--in the wake of the recently exterminated Mexican\r\nsheep of the Santa Maria Lakes region. In 1908, I solemnly warned the\r\ngovernment of President Diaz, and at that time the Mexican government\r\nexpressed much concern.\r\n\r\nIt is a great pity that just now political conditions are completely\r\nestopping wild-life protection in Mexico; but it is true. If the code of\r\nproposed laws that I drew up (by request) in 1908 and submitted to\r\nMinister Molina were adopted, it would have a good effect on the fauna\r\nof Mexico.\r\n\r\nIn Mexico there is little hoofed game to kill,--deer of the white-tail\r\ngroups, seven or eight species; the desert mule deer; the brocket; the\r\nprong-horned antelope, the mountain sheep and the peccary. The deer will\r\nnot so easily be exterminated, but the antelope and sheep will be\r\nutterly destroyed. They will be the first to go; and I think they can\r\nnot by any possibility last longer than ten years. Is it not too bad\r\nthat Mexico should permit her finest species of hoofed and horned game\r\nto be obliterated before she awakens to the desirability of\r\nconservation! The Mexicans could protect their small stock of big game\r\nif they would; but in Lower California they are leasing huge tracts of\r\nland to cattle companies, and they permit the lessees to kill all the\r\nwild game they please on their leased lands, even with the aid of dogs.\r\nThis is a vicious and fatal system, and contrary to all the laws of\r\nnations.\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nPRESENT AND FUTURE OF NORTH AMERICAN BIG GAME\r\n\r\n(Concluded)\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WHITE-TAILED DEER.--Five hundred years hence, when the greed and\r\nrapacity of \"civilized\" man has completed the loot and ruin of the\r\ncontinent of North America, the white-tailed deer will be the last\r\nspecies of our big game to be exterminated. Its mental traits, its size,\r\nits color and its habits all combine to render it the most persistent of\r\nour large animals, and the best fitted to survive. It neither bawls nor\r\nbugles to attract its enemies, it can not be called to a sportsman, like\r\nthe moose, and it sticks to its timber with rare and commendable\r\ncloseness. When it sees a strange living thing walking erect, it does\r\nnot stop to stare and catch soft-nosed bullets, but dashes away in quest\r\nof solitude.\r\n\r\nThe worst shooting that I ever did or saw done at game was at running\r\nwhite-tailed deer, in the Montana river bottoms.\r\n\r\nFor the reasons given, the white-tail exists and persists in a hundred\r\nUnited States localities from which all other big game save the black\r\nbear have been exterminated. For example, in our Adirondacks the moose\r\nwere exterminated years and years ago, but the beloved wilderness called\r\nthe \"North Woods\" still is populated by about 20,000 deer, and about\r\n8,000 are killed annually. The deer of Maine are sufficiently numerous\r\nthat in 1909 a total of 15,879 were killed. With some assistance from\r\nthe thin sprinkling of moose and caribou, the deer of Maine annually\r\ndraw into that state, for permanent dedication, a huge sum of money,\r\nvariously estimated at from $1,000,000 to $2,000,000. In spite of heavy\r\nslaughter, and vigorous attempts at extermination by over-shooting, the\r\ndeer of northern Michigan obstinately refuse to be wiped out.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, a large group of states in which this species has\r\nbeen exterminated. The states comprising it are Ohio, Indiana, Illinois,\r\nIowa, and adjacent portions of seven other states.\r\n\r\nAs if to shame the people of Iowa, a curious deer episode is recorded.\r\nIn 1885, W.B. Cuppy, of Avoca, Iowa, purchased five deer, and placed\r\nthem in a paddock on his 600-acre farm. By 1900 they had increased to 32\r\nhead; and then one night some one kindly opened the gate of their\r\nenclosure, and gave them the freedom of the city. Mr. Cuppy made no\r\neffort to capture them, possibly because they decided to annex his farm\r\nas their habitat. When a neighbor led them with a bait of corn to their\r\nowner's door, he declined to impound them, on the ground that it was\r\nunnecessary.\r\n\r\nBy 1912, those deer had increased to 400, and the portion of this story\r\nthat no one will believe is this: they spread all through the suburbs\r\nand hinterland farms of Avoca, and _the people not only failed to\r\nassassinate all of them and eat them, but they actually killed only a\r\nfew, protected the rest, and made pets of many!_ Queer people, those men\r\nand boys of Avoca. Nearly everywhere else in the world that I know, that\r\nhistory would have been ended differently. Here in the East, 90 per cent\r\nof our people are like the Avocans, but the other 10 per cent think only\r\nof slaying and eating, sans mercy, sans decency, sans law. Now the State\r\nof Iowa has taken hold, to capture some of those deer, and set them free\r\nin other portions of the state.\r\n\r\nElsewhere I shall note the quick and thorough success with which the\r\nwhite-tailed deer has been brought back in Vermont, Massachusetts,\r\nConnecticut, and southern New York.\r\n\r\nNo state having waste lands covered with brush or timber need be without\r\nthe ubiquitous white-tailed deer. Give them a semblance of a fair show,\r\nand they will live and breed with surprising fecundity and persistence.\r\nIf you start a park herd with ten does, soon you will have more deer\r\nthan you will know how to dispose of, unless you market them under a\r\nBayne law, duly tagged by the state. In close confinement this species\r\nfares rather poorly. In large preserves it does well, but during the\r\nrutting season the bucks are to be dreaded; and those that develop\r\naggressive traits should be shot and marketed. This is the only way in\r\nwhich the deer parks of England are kept safe for unarmed people.\r\n\r\nDr. T.S. Palmer has taken much pains to ascertain the number of deer\r\nkilled in the eastern United States. His records, as published in May,\r\n1910, are as follows:\r\n\r\nSTATE              1908       1909        1910\r\nMaine            15,000     15,879      15,000\r\nNew Hampshire       (a)         (a)        (a)\r\nVermont           2,700       4,736      3,649\r\nNew York          6,000       9,000      9,000\r\nNew Jersey                      (a)        120\r\nPennsylvania        500         500        800\r\nMichigan          9,076       6,641     13,347\r\nWisconsin        11,000       6,000      6,000\r\nMinnesota         6,000       6,000      3,147\r\nWest Virginia       107          51         49\r\nMaryland             16          13          6\r\nVirginia            207         210        224\r\nNorth Carolina      (a)         (a)         (a)\r\nSouth Carolina    1,000         (a)         (a)\r\nGeorgia             (a)         367        369\r\nFlorida           2,209       2,021      1,526\r\nAlabama             152         148        132\r\nMississippi         411         458        500\r\nLouisiana         5,500       5,470      5,000\r\nMassachusetts                            1,281\r\n                 ------      ------     ------\r\n Total           59,878      57,494     60,150\r\n\r\n(a) No statistics available.\r\n\r\nAt this date deer hunting is not permitted at any time in Indiana,\r\nIllinois, Iowa, Nebraska and Kansas,--where there are no wild deer; nor\r\nin Rhode Island, Connecticut, Delaware, Tennessee or Kentucky. The long\r\nclose seasons in Massachusetts, Connecticut and southern New York have\r\ncaused a great migration of deer into those once-depopulated\r\nregions,--in fact, right down to tide-water.\r\n\r\nTHE MULE DEER.--This will be the first member of the Deer Family to\r\nbecome extinct in North America outside of the protected portions of its\r\nhaunts. Its fatal preference for open ground and its habit of pausing to\r\nstare at the hunter have been, and to the end will be, its undoing.\r\nPossibly there are now two of these deer in the United States and\r\nBritish Columbia for every 98 that existed forty years ago, but no more.\r\nIt is a deer of the bad lands and foothills, and its curiosity is fatal.\r\n\r\nThe number of sportsmen who have hunted and killed this fine animal in\r\nits own wild and picturesque bad-lands is indeed quite small. It has\r\nbeen four-fifths exterminated by the resident hunter and ranchman, and\r\nto-day is found in the Rocky Mountain region most sparingly. Ten years\r\nago it seemed right to hunt the so-called Rocky Mountain \"black-tail\" in\r\nnorthwestern Montana, because so many deer were there it did not seem to\r\nspell extermination. Now, conditions have changed. Since last winter's\r\ngreat slaughter in northwestern Montana, of 11,000 hungry deer, the\r\nspecies has been so reduced that it is no longer right to kill mule deer\r\nanywhere in our country, and a universal close season for five years is\r\nthe duty of every state which contains that species.\r\n\r\nTHE REAL BLACK-TAILED DEER, of the Pacific coast, (_Odocoileus\r\ncolumbianus_) is, to most sportsmen of the Rocky Mountains and the East\r\nactually less known than the okapi! Not one out of every hundred of them\r\ncan recognize a mounted head of it at sight. It is a small,\r\ndelicately-formed, delicately-antlered understudy of the big mule deer,\r\nand now painfully limited in its distribution. It is _the_ deer of\r\nCalifornia and western Oregon, and it has been so ruthlessly slaughtered\r\nthat today it is going fast. As conditions stand to-day, and without a\r\nradical change on the part of the people of the Pacific coast, this very\r\ninteresting species is bound to disappear. It will not be persistent,\r\nlike the white-tailed deer, but in the heavy forests, it will last much\r\nlonger than the mule deer.\r\n\r\nMy information regarding this deer is like the stock of specimens of it\r\nin museum collections,--meager and unsatisfactory. We need to know in\r\ndetail how that species is faring to-day, and what its prospects are for\r\nthe immediate future. In 1900, I saw great piles of skins from it in the\r\nfur houses of Seattle, and the sight gave me much concern.\r\n\r\nTHE CARIBOU, GENERALLY.--I think it is not very difficult to forecast\r\nthe future of the Genus _Rangifer_ in North America, from the logic of\r\nthe conditions of to-day. Thanks to the splendid mass of information\r\nthat has been accumulated regarding this group, we are able to draw\r\ncertain conclusions. I think that the caribou of the Canadian Barren\r\nGrounds and northeastern Alaska will survive in great numbers for at\r\nleast another century; that the caribou herds of Newfoundland will last\r\nnearly as long, and that in fifty years or less all the caribou of the\r\ngreat northwestern wilderness will be swept away.\r\n\r\nThe reasons for these conclusions are by no means obscure, or\r\nfarfetched.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the barren-ground caribou are to-day enormously\r\nnumerous,--undoubtedly running up into millions. It can not be possible\r\nthat they are being killed faster than they are breeding; and so they\r\nmust be increasing. Their food supply is unlimited. They are protected\r\nby two redoubtable champions,--Jack Frost and the Mosquito. Their\r\ncountry never will contain a great human population. The natives are so\r\nfew in number, and so lazy, that even though they should become supplied\r\nwith modern firearms, it is unlikely that they ever will make a serious\r\nimpression on the caribou millions. The only thing to fear for the\r\nbarren-ground caribou throngs is disease,--a factor that is beyond human\r\nprediction.\r\n\r\nIt is reasonably certain that the Barren Grounds never will be netted by\r\nrailways,--unless gold is discovered over a wide area. The fierce cold\r\nand hunger, and the billions of mosquitoes of the Barren Grounds will\r\nprotect the caribou from the wholesale slaughter that \"civilized\" man\r\njoyously would inflict--if he had the chance.\r\n\r\nThe caribou thousands of Newfoundland are fairly accessible to sportsmen\r\nand pot-hunters, but at the same time the colonial government can\r\nprotect them from extermination if it will. Already much has been done\r\nto check the reckless and wicked slaughter that once prevailed. A bag\r\nlimit of three bull caribou per annum has been fixed, which is enforced\r\nas to non-residents and sportsmen, but in a way that is much too\r\n\"American\" it is often ignored by residents in touch with the game. For\r\ninstance, the guide of a New York gentleman whom I know admitted to my\r\nfriend that each year he killed \"about 25\" caribou for himself and his\r\nfamily of four other persons. He explained thus: \"When the inspector\r\ncomes around, I show him two caribou hanging in my woodshed, but back in\r\nthe woods I have a little shack where I keep the others until I want\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\nThe real sportsmen of the world never will make the slightest\r\nperceptible impression on the caribou of Newfoundland. For one thing,\r\nthe hunting is much too tame to be interesting. If the caribou of that\r\nIsland ever are exterminated, it will be strictly by the people of\r\nNewfoundland, themselves. If the government will tighten its grip on the\r\nherds, they need never be exterminated.\r\n\r\nThe caribou of New Brunswick, Quebec and Ontario are few and widely\r\nscattered. Unless carefully conserved, they are not likely to last long;\r\nfor their country is annually penetrated in every direction by armed\r\nmen, white and red. There is no means by which it can be proven, but\r\nfrom the number of armed men in those regions I feel sure that the\r\ntypical woodland caribou species is being shot faster than it is\r\nbreeding. The sportsmen and naturalists of Canada and New Brunswick\r\nwould render good service by making a close and careful investigation of\r\nthat question.\r\n\r\nThe caribou of the northwestern wilderness are in a situation peculiarly\r\ntheir own. They inhabit a region of naked mountains and _thin_ forests,\r\nwherein they are conspicuous, easily stalked and easily killed. Nowhere\r\ndo they exist in large herds of thousands, or even of many hundreds.\r\nThey live in small bands of from ten to twenty head, and even those are\r\nfar apart. The region in which they live is certain to be thoroughly\r\nopened up by railways, and exploited. Fifty years from now we will find\r\nevery portion of the now-wild Northwest fairly accessible by rail. The\r\nbuilding of the railways will be to the caribou--and to other big\r\ngame--the day of doom. In that wild, rough region, no power on\r\nearth,--save that which might be able to deprive _all_ the inhabitants\r\nand all visitors of firearms,--can possibly save the game outside of a\r\nfew preserves that are diligently patroled.\r\n\r\nThe big game of the northwest region, in which I include the interior of\r\nAlaska, _will go_! It is only a question of time. Already the building\r\nof the city of Fairbanks, and the exploitation of the mining districts\r\nsurrounding it, have led to such harassment and slaughter of the\r\nmigrating caribou that the great herd which formerly traversed the\r\nTanana country once a year has completely changed its migration route,\r\nand now keeps much farther north. The \"crossing\" of the Yukon near Eagle\r\nCity has been abandoned. A hundred years hence, the northwestern\r\nwilderness will be dotted with towns and criss-crossed with railways;\r\nbut the big game of it will be gone, except in the preserves that are\r\nyet to be made. This will particularly involve the caribou, moose, and\r\nmountain sheep of all species, which will be the first to go. The\r\nmountain goat and the forest bears will hold out longer than their more\r\nexposed neighbors of the treeless mountains.\r\n\r\nTHE MOOSE.--In the United States the moose is found in five\r\nstates,--Maine, Minnesota, Montana, Wyoming and Idaho. There are 550 in\r\nthe Yellowstone Park. In Maine and Minnesota only may moose be hunted\r\nand killed. In the season of 1909, 184 moose were killed in Maine,--a\r\nlarge number, considering the small moose population of that state. In\r\nnorthern Minnesota, we now possess a great national moose preserve of\r\n909,743 acres; and in 1908 Mr. Fullerton, after a personal inspection in\r\nwhich he saw 189 moose in nine days, estimated the total moose\r\npopulation of the present day at 10,000 head. This is a moose preserve\r\nworth while.\r\n\r\nOutside of protected areas, the moose is the animal that is most easily\r\nexterminated. Its trail is easily followed, and its habits are\r\nthoroughly known, down to three decimal places. As a hunter's reward it\r\nis Great. Strange to say, New Brunswick has found that the moose is an\r\nanimal that it is possible, and even easy, to protect. The death of a\r\nmoose is an event that is not easily concealed! Wherever it is\r\nthoroughly understood that the moose law will be enforced, the would-be\r\npoacher pauses to consider the net results to him of a jail sentence.\r\n\r\nIn New Brunswick we have seen two strange things happen, during our own\r\ntimes. We have seen the moose migrate into, and permanently occupy, an\r\nextensive area that previously was destitute of that species. At the\r\nsame time, we have seen a reasonable number of bull moose killed by\r\nsportsmen without disturbing in the least the general equanimity of the\r\ngeneral moose population! And at this moment, the moose population of\r\nNew Brunswick is almost incredible. Every moose hunter who goes there\r\nsees from 20 to 40 moose, and two of my friends last year saw, \"in round\r\nnumbers, about 100!\" Up to date the size of adult antlers seem to be\r\nmaintaining a high standard.\r\n\r\nIn summer, the photographing of moose in the rivers, lakes and ponds of\r\nMaine and New Brunswick amounts to an industry. I am uneasy about the\r\nconstant picking off of the largest and best breeding bulls of the\r\nMirimachi country, lest it finally reduce the size and antlers of the\r\nmoose of that region; but only the future can tell us just how that\r\nprospect stands to-day.\r\n\r\nIn Alaska, our ever thoughtful and forehanded Biological Survey of the\r\nDepartment of Agriculture has by legal proclamation at one stroke\r\nconverted the whole of the Kenai Peninsula into a magnificent moose\r\npreserve. This will save _Alces gigas_, the giant moose of Alaska, from\r\nextermination; and New Brunswick and the Minnesota preserve will save\r\n_Alces americanus_. But in the northwest, we can positively depend upon\r\nit that eventually, wherever the moose may legally be hunted and killed\r\nby any Tom, Dick or Harry who can afford a twenty-dollar rifle and a\r\nlicense, the moose surely will disappear.\r\n\r\nThe moose laws of Alaska are strict--toward sportsmen, only! The miners,\r\n\"prospectors\" and Indians may kill as many as they please, \"for food\r\npurposes.\" This opens the door to a great amount of unfair slaughter.\r\nAny coffee-cooler can put a pan and pick into his hunting outfit, go out\r\nafter moose, and call himself a \"prospector.\"\r\n\r\nI grant that the _real_ prospector, who is looking for ores and minerals\r\nwith an intelligent eye, and knows what he is doing, should have special\r\nprivileges on game, to keep him from starving. The settled miner,\r\nhowever, is in a different class. No miner should ask the privilege of\r\nliving on wild game, any more than should the farmer, the steamboat man,\r\nthe railway laborer, or the soldier in an army post. The Indian should\r\nhave no game advantages whatever over a white man. He does not own the\r\ngame of a region, any more than he owns its minerals or its water-power.\r\nHe should obey the general game laws, just the same as white men. In\r\nAfrica, as far as possible, the white population wisely prohibits the\r\nnatives from owning or using firearms, and a good idea it is, too. I am\r\nglad there is one continent on which the \"I'm-just-as-good-as-you-are\"\r\nnightmare does not curse the whole land.\r\n\r\nTHE MUSK-OX.--Now that the north pole has been safely discovered, and\r\nthe south pole has become the storm-center of polar exploration, the\r\nharried musk-ox herds of the farthest north are having a rest. I think\r\nthat most American sportsmen have learned that as a sporting proposition\r\nthere is about as much fun and glory in harrying a musk-ox herd with\r\ndogs, and picking off the members of it at \"parade rest,\" as there is in\r\nshooting range cattle in a round-up. The habits of the animal positively\r\neliminate the real essence of sport,--difficulty and danger. When a\r\nmusk-ox band is chased by dogs, or by wolves, the full-grown members of\r\nit, bulls and cows alike, instantly form a close circle around the\r\ncalves, facing outward shoulder to shoulder, and stand at bay. Without\r\nthe aid of a gunner and a rifle, such a formation is invincible! Mr.\r\nPaul Rainey's moving pictures tell a wonderful story of animal\r\nintelligence, bravery and devotion to the parental instinct.\r\n\r\nFor some reason, the musk-ox herds do not seem to have perceptibly\r\nincreased since man first encountered them. The number alive to-day\r\nappears to be no greater than it was fifty years ago; and this leads to\r\nthe conclusion that the present delicate balance could easily be\r\ndisturbed the wrong way. Fortunately, it seems reasonably certain that\r\nthe Indians of the Canadian Barren Grounds, the Eskimo of the far north,\r\nand the stray explorers all live outside the haunts of the species, and\r\ncome in touch only with the edge of the musk-ox population as a whole.\r\nThis leads us to hope and believe that, through the difficulties\r\ninvolved in reaching them, the main bodies of musk-ox of both species\r\nare safe from extermination.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the time has come for Canada, the United States and\r\nDenmark to join in formulating a stiff law for the prevention of\r\nwholesale slaughter of musk-ox for sport. It should be rendered\r\nimpossible for another sportsman to kill twenty-three head in one day,\r\nas once occurred. Give the sportsman a bag of three bulls, and no more.\r\nTo this, no true sportsman will object, and the objections of game-hogs\r\nonly serve to confirm the justice of the thing they oppose.\r\n\r\nTHE GRIZZLY BEAR.--To many persons it may seem strange that anyone\r\nshould feel disposed to accord protection to such fierce predatory\r\nanimals as grizzly bears, lions and tigers. But the spirit of fair play\r\nsprings eternal in some human breasts. The sportsmen of the world do not\r\nstick at using long-range, high-power repeating rifles on big game, but\r\nthey draw the line this side of traps, poisons and extermination. The\r\nsportsmen of India once thought,--for about a year and a day,--that it\r\nwas permissible to kill troublesome and expensive tigers by poison. Mr.\r\nG.P. Sanderson tried it, and when his strychnine operations promptly\r\ndeveloped three bloated and disgusting tiger carcasses, even his native\r\nfollowers revolted at the principle. That was the alpha and omega of\r\nSanderson's poisoning activities.\r\n\r\nI am quite sure that if the extermination of the tiger from the whole of\r\nIndia were possible, and the to-be or not-to-be were put to a vote of\r\nthe sportsmen of India, the answer would be a thundering _\"No!\"_ Says\r\nMajor J. Stevenson-Hamilton in his \"Animal Life in Africa:\" \"It is\r\nimpossible to contemplate the use against the lion of any other weapon\r\nthan the rifle.\"\r\n\r\nThe real sportsmen and naturalists of America are decidedly opposed to\r\nthe extermination of the grizzly bear. They feel that the wilds of North\r\nAmerica are wide enough for the accommodation of many grizzlies, without\r\ncrowding the proletariat. A Rocky Mountain without a grizzly upon it, or\r\nat least a bear of some kind, is only half a mountain,--commonplace and\r\ntame. Put one two-year-old grizzly cub upon it, and presto! every cubic\r\nyard of its local atmosphere reeks with romantic uncertainty and\r\nfearsome thrills.\r\n\r\nA few persons have done considerable talking and writing about the\r\ndamage to stock inflicted by bears, but I think there is little\r\njustification for such charges. Certainly, there is not one-tenth enough\r\nreal damage done by bears to justify their extermination. At the present\r\ntime, we hear that the farmers (!) of Kadiak Island, Alaska, are being\r\nseriously harassed and damaged by the big Kadiak bear,--an animal so\r\nrare and shy that it is very difficult for a sportsman to kill one! I\r\nthink the charges against the bears,--if the Kadiak Islanders ever\r\nreally have made any,--need to be proven, by the production of real\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, outside of our game preserves, I know of not one\r\nlocality in which grizzly bears are sufficiently numerous to justify a\r\nsportsman in going out to hunt them. The California grizzly, once\r\nrepresented by \"Monarch\" in Golden Gate Park, is almost, if not wholly,\r\nextinct. In Montana, outside of Glacier Park it is useless to apply for\r\nwild grizzlies. In the Bitter Root Mountains and Clearwater Mountains of\r\nIdaho, there are grizzlies, but they hide so effectually under the\r\nsnow-bent willows on the \"slides\" that it is almost impossible to get a\r\nshot. Northwestern Wyoming still contains a few grizzlies, but there are\r\nso many square miles of mountains around each animal it is now almost\r\nuseless to go hunting for them. British Columbia, western Alberta and\r\nthe coast mountains at least as far as Skaguay, and Yukon Territory\r\ngenerally, all contain grizzlies, and the sportsman who goes out for\r\nsheep, caribou and moose is reasonably certain to see half a dozen bears\r\nand kill at least one or two. In those countries, the grizzly species\r\nwill hold forth long after all killable grizzlies have vanished from the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nI think that it is now time for California, Montana, Washington, Oregon,\r\nIdaho and Wyoming to give grizzly bears protection of some sort.\r\nPossibly the situation in those states calls for a five-year close\r\nseason. Even British Columbia should now place a bag limit on this\r\nspecies. This has seemed clear to me ever since two of my friends killed\r\n(in the spring of 1912) _six_ grizzlies in one week! But Provincial Game\r\nWarden A. Bryan Williams says that at present it would be impossible to\r\nimpose a bag limit of one per year on the grizzlies of British Columbia;\r\nand Mr. Williams is a sincere game-protector.\r\n\r\nTHE BROWN BEARS OF ALASKA.--These magnificent monsters present a\r\nperplexing problem, which I am inclined to believe can be satisfactorily\r\nsolved by the Biological Survey only in short periods, say of three or\r\nfour years each. Naturally, the skin hunters of Alaska ardently desire\r\nthe skins of those bears, for the money they represent. That side of the\r\nbear problem does not in the least appeal to the ninety odd millions of\r\npeople who live this side of Alaska. The skins of the Alaskan brown\r\nbears have little value save as curiosities, nailed upon the wall, where\r\nthey can not be stepped upon and injured. The _hunting_ of those bears,\r\nhowever, is a business for men; and it is partly for that reason they\r\nshould be preserved. A bear-hunt on the Alaska Peninsula, Admiralty or\r\nMontagu Islands, is an event of a lifetime, and with a bag limit of\r\n_one_ brown bear, the species would be quite safe from extermination.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE WICHITA NATIONAL BISON HERD\r\nPresented by the New York Zoological Society]\r\n\r\nIn Alaska there is some dissatisfaction over the protection accorded the\r\nbig brown bears; but those rules are right _as far as they go_! A\r\ngovernor of Alaska once said to me: \"The preservation of the game of\r\nAlaska should be left to the _people_ of Alaska. It is their game; and\r\nthey will preserve it all right!\"\r\n\r\nThe answer? _Not by a long shot_!\r\n\r\nOnly three things were wrong with the ex-governor's view:\r\n\r\n1.--The game of Alaska does _not_ belong to the people who live in\r\nAlaska--with the intent to get out to-morrow! It belongs to the\r\n93,000,000 people of the Nation.\r\n\r\n2.--The preservation of the Alaskan fauna on the public domain should\r\nnot be left unreservedly to the people of Alaska, because\r\n\r\n3.--As sure as shooting, they will _not_ preserve it!\r\n\r\nCongress is right in appropriating $15,000 for game protection in\r\nAlaska. It is very necessary that the regulations for conserving the\r\nwild life should be fixed by the Secretary of Agriculture, with the\r\nadvice of the Biological Survey.\r\n\r\nTHE BLACK BEAR is an interesting citizen. He harms nobody nor anything;\r\nhe affords good sport; he objects to being exterminated, and wherever in\r\nNorth America he is threatened with extermination, he should at once be\r\ngiven protection! A black bear _in the wilds_ is harmless. In captivity,\r\nposed as a household \"pet,\" he is decidedly dangerous, and had best be\r\ngiven the middle of the road. In big forests he is a grand stayer, and\r\nwill not be exterminated from the fauna of the United States until\r\nWashington is wrecked by anarchists.\r\n\r\nTHE AMERICAN BISON.--I regard the American bison species as now\r\nreasonably secure against extermination. This is due to the fact that it\r\nbreeds persistently and successfully in captivity, and to the great\r\nefforts that have been put forth by the United States Government, the\r\nCanadian Government, the American Bison Society, the New York Zoological\r\nSociety, and several private individuals.\r\n\r\nThe species reached its lowest ebb in 1889, when there were only 256\r\nhead in captivity and 835 running wild. The increase has been as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n1888--W.T. Hornaday's census                     1,300\r\n1902--S.P. Langley's census                      1,394\r\n1905--Frank Baker's census                       1,697\r\n1908--W.T. Hornaday's census                     2,047\r\n1910--W.P. Wharton's census (in North America)   2,108\r\n1912--W.P. Wharton's census (in North America)   2,907\r\n\r\nTo-day, nearly one-half of the living bison are in very large\r\ngovernmental parks, perpetually established and breeding rapidly, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nIN THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nYellowstone Park fenced herd, founded by Congress                   125\r\nMontana National Bison Range, founded by The American Bison Society  69\r\nWichita Bison Range, founded by The New York Zoological Society      39\r\nWind Cave Bison Range, S.

Two\r\ngovernments and two thousand individuals have shared this task,--solely\r\nfor sentimental reasons. In these facts we find reason to hope and\r\nbelieve that other efforts now being made to save other species from\r\nannihilation will be equally successful.\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nTHE PRESENT AND FUTURE OF AFRICAN GAME\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks to the diligence with which sportsmen and field naturalists have\r\nrecorded their observations in the haunts of big game, it is not at all\r\ndifficult to forecast the immediate future of the big game of the world.\r\nWe may safely assume that all lands well suited to agriculture, mining\r\nand grazing will become populated by rifle-bearing men, with the usual\r\nresult to the wild mammals and birds. At the same time, the game of the\r\nopen mountains everywhere is thinly distributed and easily exterminated.\r\nOn the other hand, the unconquerable forest jungles of certain portions\r\nof the tropics will hold their own, and shelter their four-footed\r\ninhabitants for centuries to come.\r\n\r\nOn the open mountains of the world and on the grazing lands most big\r\ngame is now being killed much faster than it breeds. This is due to the\r\nattacks of five times too many hunters, open seasons that are too long,\r\nand bag limits that are far too liberal. As an example, consider Africa\r\nViewed in any way it may be taken, the bag limit in British East Africa\r\nis appallingly high. Notice this astounding array of wild creatures that\r\n_each hunter_ may kill under a license costing _only $250!_\r\n\r\n 2 Buffalo\r\n 2 Rhinoceros\r\n 2 Hippopotamus\r\n 1 Eland\r\n 2 Grevy Zebra\r\n20 Common Zebra\r\n 2 Fringe-eared Oryx\r\n 4 Beisa Antelope\r\n 4 Waterbuck\r\n 1 Sable Antelope\r\n 1 Roan Antelope\r\n 1 Greater Kudu\r\n 4 Lesser Kudu\r\n10 Topi\r\n20 Coke Hartebeest\r\n 2 Neumann Hartebeest\r\n 4 Jackson Hartebeest\r\n 6 Hunter's Antelope\r\n 4 Thomas Kob\r\n 2 Bongo\r\n 4 Pallah\r\n 2 Sitatunga\r\n 3 Gnu\r\n12 Grant Gazelle\r\n 4 Waller's Gazelle\r\n10 Harvey's Duiker\r\n10 Isaac's Duiker\r\n10 Blue Duiker\r\n10 Kirk's Dik-dik\r\n10 Guenther's Dik-dik\r\n10 Hinde's Dik-dik\r\n10 Cavendish Dik-dik\r\n10 Abyssinian Oribi\r\n10 Haggard's Oribi\r\n10 Kenya Oribi\r\n10 Suni\r\n10 Klipspringer\r\n10 Ward's Reedbuck\r\n10 Chanler's Reedbuck\r\n10 Thompson Gazelle\r\n10 Peters Gazelle\r\n10 Soemmerring Gazelle\r\n10 Bushbuck\r\n10 Haywood Bushbuck\r\n\r\nThe grand total is a possible 300 large hoofed and horned animals\r\nrepresenting _44 species_! Add to this all the lions, leopards,\r\ncheetahs, cape hunting dogs and hyaenas that the hunter can kill, and\r\nit will be enough to stock a zoological garden!\r\n\r\nQuite a number of these species, like the sable antelope, kudu, Hunter's\r\nantelope, bongo and sitatunga are already rare, and therefore they are\r\nall the more eagerly sought.\r\n\r\nInto the fine grass-lands of British East Africa, suitable for crops and\r\nstock grazing, settlers are steadily going. Each one is armed, and at\r\nonce becomes a killer of big game. And all the time the visiting\r\nsportsmen are increasing in number, going farther from the Uganda\r\nRailway, and persistently seeking out the rarest and finest of the game.\r\nThe buffalo has recovered from the slaughter by rinderpest only in time\r\nto meet the onset of oversea sportsmen.\r\n\r\nMr. Arthur Jordan has seen much of the big game of British East Africa,\r\nand its killing. Him I asked to tell me how long, in his opinion, the\r\nbig game of that territory will last outside of the game preserves, as\r\nit is now being killed. He said, \"Oh, it will last a long time. I think\r\nit will last fifteen years!\"\r\n\r\n_Fifteen years!_ And this for the richest big-game fauna of any one spot\r\nin the whole world, which Nature has been _several million years in\r\ndeveloping and placing there_!\r\n\r\nAt present the marvelous herds of big game of British East Africa and\r\nUganda constitute the grandest zoological spectacle that the world ever\r\nhas seen in historic times. For such an area, the number of species is\r\nincredible, and until they are seen, the thronging masses of individuals\r\nare beyond conception. It is easy to say \"a herd of 3,000 zebras;\" but\r\nno mere words can give an adequate impression of the actual army of\r\nstripes and bars, and hoofs thundering in review over a grassy plain.\r\n\r\nBut the settlers say, \"The zebras must go! They break through our best\r\nwire fences, ruin our crops, despoil us of the fruits of long and\r\ntoilsome efforts, and much expenditure. We simply can not live in a\r\ncountry inhabited by herds of wild zebras.\" And really, their contention\r\nis well founded. When it is necessary to choose between wild animals and\r\npeaceful agriculture for millions of men, the animals must give way.\r\n\r\nIn those portions of the great East African plateau region that are\r\nsuited to modern agriculture, stretching from Buluwayo to northern\r\nUganda, the wild herds are doomed to be crowded out by the farmer and\r\nthe fruit-grower. This is the inevitable result of civilization and\r\nprogress in wild lands. Marauding battalions of zebras, bellicose\r\nrhinoceroses and murderous buffaloes do not fit in with ranches and\r\ncrops, and children going to school. Except in the great game preserves,\r\nthe swamps and the dense jungles it is certain that the big game of the\r\nwhole of eastern Africa is foredoomed to disappear,--the largest and\r\nmost valuable species first.\r\n\r\nFive hundred years from now, when North America is worn out, and wasted\r\nto a skeleton of what it now is, the great plateau region of East Africa\r\nbetween Cape Town and Lake Rudolph will be a mighty empire, teeming\r\nwith white population. Giraffes and rhinoceroses now are trampling over\r\nthe sites of the cities and universities of the future. Then the herds\r\nof grand game that now make Africa a sportsman's wonderland will exist\r\nonly in closed territory, in books, and in memory.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP SHOWING THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE LION\r\nIncidentally, it is also an Index of the Disappearance of African Big\r\nGame Generally. From an Article in the Review of Reviews, for August,\r\n1912, by Cyrus C. Adams, and Based Largely upon the Exhaustive Studies\r\nof Dr. C.M. Engel, of Copenhagen.]\r\n\r\nFrom what has befallen in South Africa, we can easily and correctly\r\nforecast the future of the big game of British East Africa and Uganda.\r\nLess than fifty years ago, Cape Colony, Natal, Zululand, and every\r\ncountry up to the Zambesi was teeming with herds of big wild animals,\r\njust as the northern provinces now are. As late as 1890, when Rhodesia\r\nwas taken over by the Chartered Company, and the capital city of\r\nSalisbury was staked out, an American boy in the Pioneer Corps, now\r\nHonorable William Harvey Brown, of Salisbury, wrote thus of the Gwibi\r\nFlats, near Salisbury:\r\n\r\n\"That evening I beheld on those flats a sight which probably will never\r\nagain be seen there to the end of the world. The variety deploying\r\nbefore me was almost incredible! There, within the range of my vision\r\nwere groups of roan, sable and tsessebi antelopes, Burchell zebras, [now\r\ntotally extinct!] elands, reedbucks, steinbucks and ostriches. It was\r\nlike Africa in the days of Livingstone. As I sat on my horse, viewing\r\nwith amazement this wonderful panorama of wild life, I was startled by a\r\nherd that came galloping around a small hill just behind me.\"--(\"_On the\r\nSouth African Frontier_,\" p. 114.)\r\n\r\nThat was in 1890. And how is it to-day?\r\n\r\nSalisbury is a modern city, endorsed by two lines of railway. The Gwibi\r\nFlats are farms. There is some big game yet, in Rhodesia south of the\r\nZambesi, but to find it you must go at least a week's journey from the\r\ncapital, to the remote corners that have not yet been converted into\r\nfarms or mining settlements. North of the Zambesi, Rhodesia yet contains\r\nplenty of big game. The Victoria Falls station is a popular starting\r\npoint for hunting expeditions headed northeast and northwest. In the\r\nnorthwest the game is yet quite in a state of nature. Unfortunately the\r\nBarotse natives of that region can procure from the Portuguese traders\r\nall the firearms and ammunition that they can pay for, and by treaty\r\nthey retain their hunting rights. The final result will\r\nbe--extermination of the game.\r\n\r\nElsewhere throughout Rhodesia the natives are not permitted to have guns\r\nand gunpowder,--a very wise regulation. In Alaska our Indians are\r\nprivileged to kill game all the year round, and they have modern\r\nfirearms with which to do it.\r\n\r\nAnd how is it with the game of that day?\r\n\r\nThe true Burchell's zebra is now regarded as _extinct_! In Cape Colony\r\nand Natal, that once teemed with big game in the old-fashioned African\r\nway, they are _counting the individual wild animals that remain_! Also,\r\nthey are making game preserves, literally everywhere.\r\n\r\nNow that the best remaining game districts of Africa are rapidly coming\r\nunder British control, it is a satisfaction to observe that the\r\ngoverning bodies and executive officers are alive to the necessity of\r\npreserving the big game from actual extinction. Excepting German East\r\nAfrica, from Uganda to Cape Colony the game preserves form an almost\r\ncontinuous chain. It is quite impossible to enumerate all of them; but\r\nthe two in British East Africa are of enormous size, and are well\r\nstocked with game. South Africa contains a great many smaller preserves\r\nand a few specimen herds of big game, but that is about all. Except in a\r\nfew localities the hunting of big game in that region is done forever.\r\n\r\nThe Western Districts Game and Trout Protective Association of South\r\nAfrica recently, (1911), has made careful counts and estimates of the\r\nnumber of individual game animals remaining in Cape Colony, with the\r\nfollowing result:\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nBIG GAME IN THE CAPE PROVINCE\r\n\r\nFrom information kindly placed at the disposal of the Association by the\r\nGovernment, it was found that the following varieties of big game are\r\nstill found in the Province. The numbers, however, are only approximate:\r\n\r\n_Blesbok_: About 400 in Steynsburg, and 35 in Queen's Town divisions.\r\n\r\n_Bontebok_: About 30 in Bredasdorp and 45 in Swellendam divisions.\r\n\r\n_Buffalo_: About 340 in Uitenhage, 120 in Alexandria, and 75 in Bathurst\r\ndivisions.\r\n\r\n_Elephants_: About 130 in Alexandria, 160 in Uitenhage, 40 in Bathurst,\r\nand 20 in Knysna divisions.\r\n\r\n_Gemsbok_: About 2,450 in Namaqualand, 4,500 in Vryburg, 4,000 in\r\nGordonia, and 670 in the Kenhardt, Mafeking and Barkly West divisions.\r\n\r\n_Koodoo_: About 10,000, found chiefly in the divisions of Albany, Barkly\r\nWest, Fort Beaufort, Hay, Herbert, Jansenville, Kuruman, Ladismith,\r\nMafeking, Mossel Bay, Oudtshoorn, Riversdale, Steytlerville, Uitenhage,\r\nVictoria East and Vryburg.\r\n\r\n_Oribi_: About 120, in the divisions of Albany and Alexandria.\r\n\r\n_Rietbok_: About 170, in the Komgha division.\r\n\r\n_Zebra_: About 560, most of which are to be found in the divisions of\r\nCradock, George and Oudtshoorn. A few are to be found in the divisions\r\nof Uniondale and Uitenhage.\r\n\r\n_Springbok_: Being migratory, it is difficult to estimate their number.\r\nIn some years they are compelled by drought to invade the Province in\r\nlarge numbers. They are then seen as far south as Calvinia and\r\nFraserburg. Large numbers are, however, fenced in on private estates in\r\nvarious parts of the Province.\r\n\r\n_Klipspringers_: About 11,200, in the following divisions, viz.:\r\nNamaqualand, 6,559; Kuruman, 2,100; Steytlerville, 1,530; Oudtshoorn,\r\n275; Hay, 250; Ladismith, 220; Graaff-Reinet, 119; Kenhardt, 66; and\r\nCradock, 56.\r\n\r\n_Hartebeest_: About 9,700, principally in the divisions of Vryburg,\r\nGordonia, Kuruman, Mafeking, Kimberley, Hay and Beaufort West.\r\n\r\n_Wildebeest_: About 3,450 in Vryburg, 80 each in Gordonia and Kuruman,\r\n65 in Mafeking, 20 in Queen's Town, and a few in the Bredasdorp\r\ndivisions.\r\n\r\n_Eland_: About 12 in the Graaff-Reinet division, privately bred.\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nThe above showing of the pitifully small numbers of the specimens that\r\nconstitute the remnant of the big-game of the Cape suggest just one\r\nthing:--a universal close season throughout Cape Colony, and no hunting\r\nwhatever for ten years. And yet, what do we see?\r\n\r\nThe Report from which the above census was taken contains half a column\r\nof solid matter, in small type, giving a list of the _open seasons_ all\r\nover Cape Colony, during which killing may be done! So it seems that the\r\nspirit of slaughter is the same in Africa that it is in\r\nAmerica,--_kill_, as long as there is _anything_ alive to kill!\r\n\r\nThis list is of startling interest, because it shows how closely the\r\nsmall remnants of big game are now marked down in South Africa.\r\n\r\nIn view of the success with which Englishmen protect their game when\r\nonce they have made up their minds to do so, it is fair to expect that\r\nthe herds now under protection, as listed above, will save their\r\nrespective species from extinction. It is alarming, however, to note the\r\nwide territory covered by the deadly \"open seasons,\" and to wonder when\r\nthe bars really will be put up.\r\n\r\nTo-day, Mashonaland is a very-much-settled colony. The Cape to Cairo\r\nrailway and trains de luxe long ago attained the Palls of the Zambesi,\r\nand now the Curator of the Salisbury Museum will have to search\r\ndiligently in far off Nyassaland, and beyond the Zambesi River, to find\r\nenough specimens to fill his cases with representatives of the vanished\r\nRhodesian fauna. Once (1892) the white rhinoceros was found in northern\r\nRhodesia; but never again. In Salisbury, elands and zebras are nearly as\r\ngreat a curiosity as they are in St. Louis.\r\n\r\nBut for the discovery of white rhinoceroses in the Lado district, on the\r\nwestern bank of the Nile below Gondokoro, we would now be saying that\r\n_Rhinoceros simus_ is within about ten specimens of total extinction.\r\n\r\nFrom South Africa, as far up as Salisbury, in central Rhodesia, at least\r\n99 per cent of the big game has disappeared before the white man's\r\nrifle. Let him who doubts this scan the census of wild animals still\r\nliving in Cape Colony.\r\n\r\nFrom all the other regions of Africa that are easily accessible to\r\ngunners, the animal life is vigorously being shot out, and no man in his\r\nsenses will now say that the big game is breeding faster than it is\r\nbeing killed. The reverse is painfully true. Mr. Carl Akeley, in his\r\nquest for a really large male elephant for the American Museum found and\r\nlooked over _a thousand_ males without finding one that was really fine\r\nand typical. All the photographs of elephant herds that were taken by\r\nKermit Roosevelt and Akeley show a striking absence of adult males and\r\nof females with long tusks. There are only young males, and young\r\nfemales with small, short tusks. The answer is--the white ivory hunters\r\nhave killed nearly all the elephants bearing good ivory.\r\n\r\nThe slaughter of big game is going on furiously in British East Africa\r\nbecause the Uganda Railway opens up the entire territory to hunters.\r\nAnyone, man or woman, who can raise $5,000 in cash can go there and make\r\na huge \"bag\" of big game. With a license costing only $250 he can kill\r\nenough big game to sink a ship.\r\n\r\nThe bag limit in British East Africa is ruinously extravagant. If the\r\ngovernment desires the extermination of the game, such a bag limit\r\nsurely will promote that end. It is awful to think that for a petty sum\r\nany man may buy the right to kill 300 _head_ of hoofed and horned\r\nanimals, of 44 species, not counting the carnivorous animals that also\r\nmay be killed. That bag limit should _immediately_ be reduced _75 per\r\ncent_!\r\n\r\nAs matters stand to-day in British East Africa, the big game of the\r\ncountry, outside the three preserves, is absolutely certain to\r\ndisappear, in about one-fourth of the time that it took South Africa to\r\naccomplish the same result. The reasons are obvious:--superior\r\naccessibility, more deadly rifles, expert professional guides, and a\r\nwidespread craze for killing big game. With care and economy, British\r\nEast Africa should furnish good hunting for two centuries, but as\r\nthings are going on to-day, twenty years will see a tremendous change\r\nfor the worse, and a disappearance of game that will literally astonish\r\nthe natives.\r\n\r\nGerman East Africa and Uganda will not exterminate their quotas of big\r\ngame quite so soon. The absence of railways is a great factor in\r\ngame-existence. The Congo Free State contains game and sporting\r\npossibilities--on the unexplored uplands _between the rivers_,--that are\r\nas yet totally unknown to sportsmen at large. We are accustomed to\r\nthinking of the whole basin of the Congo as a vast, gloomy and\r\nimpenetrable forest.\r\n\r\nThere is to-day in Africa a vast reserve supply of grand game. It\r\ninhabits regions that are either unknown, or most difficult to\r\npenetrate. As a species in point, consider the okapi. Only the boldest\r\nand most persistent explorers ever have set foot in its tangled and\r\nmiasmatic haunts. It may be twenty years before a living specimen can be\r\nbrought out. The gorilla and the chimpanzee are so well protected by the\r\ndensity of their jungles that they never can be exterminated--until the\r\nnatives are permitted to have all the firearms that they desire! When\r\nthat day arrives, it is \"good-night\" to all the wild life that is large\r\nenough to eat or to wear.\r\n\r\nThe quagga and the blaubok became _extinct_ before the world learned\r\nthat their existence was threatened! The giant eland, the sable\r\nantelope, the greater kudu, the bontebok, blessbok, the mountain and\r\nBurchell zebras, all the giraffes save that of Nigeria, the big\r\nwaterbucks, the nyala, the sitatunga, the bongo, and the gerenuk--all\r\nwill go in the same way, everywhere outside the game preserves. The\r\nbuffalo, zebra and rhinoceros are especially marked for destruction, as\r\nannoyances to colonists. You who read of the killing of these species\r\nto-day will read of their total disappearance to-morrow. So long as the\r\nhunting of them is permitted, their ultimate disappearance is fixed and\r\ncertain. It is not the way of rifle-shooting English colonists to permit\r\nherds of big game to run about merely to be looked at.\r\n\r\nNaturally, the open plains of Africa, and the thin forests of the\r\nplateau regions, will be the first to lose their big game. In the gloomy\r\nfastnesses of the great equatorial forests, and other really dense\r\nforests wherever found, the elephants, the Derby eland, the bongo, the\r\nokapi, the buffaloes (of three species), the bush-pigs, the bushbucks\r\nand the forest-loving antelopes generally will live, for possibly one\r\nhundred years,--_or until the natives secure plenty of modern firearms\r\nand ammunition_. Whenever and wherever savages become supplied with\r\nrifles, then it is time to measure each big-game animal for its coffin.\r\n\r\nThe elephants of the great equatorial forest westward of the lake region\r\nwill survive long after the last eastern elephant has bitten the dust.\r\nThe pygmy elephant of the lower Congo region (_Elephas pumilio_) will be\r\nthe last African elephant species to disappear--because it inhabits\r\ndense miasmatic jungles, its tusks are of the smallest size, and it has\r\nthe least commercial value.\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nTHE PRESENT AND FUTURE OF THE GAME OF ASIA\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter a successful survival of man's influence through two thousand\r\nyears, at last the big game of India has made a good start on the road\r\nto vanishment. Up to 1870 it had held its own with a tenacity that was\r\nastonishing. In 1877, I found the Ganges--Jumna dooab, the Animallai\r\nHills, the Wynaad Forest and Ceylon literally teeming with herds of\r\ngame. The Animallais in particular were a hunter's paradise. In each day\r\nof hunting, large game of some kind was a certainty. The Nilgiri Hills\r\nhad been quite well shot out, but in view of the very small area and\r\nopen, golf-links character of the whole top of that wonderful sky\r\nplateau, that was no cause for wonderment.\r\n\r\nIn those days no native shikaree owned and operated a gun,--or at the\r\nmost very, very few of them did. If a rogue elephant, a man-eating tiger\r\nor a nasty leopard became a public nuisance, it was a case for a sahib\r\nto come and doctor it with a .577 double-barreled express rifle, worth\r\n$150 or more; and the sahibs had shooting galore.\r\n\r\nI think that no such great wild-life sights as those of the plateau\r\nregions of Africa ever were seen in southern Asia. Conditions there are\r\ndifferent, and usually the game is widely scattered. The sambar deer and\r\nmuntjac of the dense forests, the axis of the bamboo glades, the thameng\r\ndeer of the Burmese jungles, the sladang, or gaur, of the awful Malay\r\ntangle, and the big cats and canines will last long and well. The\r\nibexes, markhors, tahr and all the wild sheep eventually will be shot\r\nout by sportsmen who are \"sheep crazy.\" The sheep and goats of Asia will\r\ndisappear soon after the plains animals of Africa, because no big game\r\nthat lives in the open can much longer endure the modern, inexpensive\r\nlong-range rifles of deadly accuracy and limitless repetition of fire.\r\n\r\nEventually, I fear that by some unlucky turn of Fortune's wheel all the\r\nnative hunters of Asia will obtain rifles; and when they do, we soon\r\nwill see the end of the big game.\r\n\r\nEven to-day we find that the primitive conditions of 1877 have been\r\ngreatly changed. In the first place, about every native shikaree\r\n(hunter) owns a rifle, at a cost of about $25; and many other natives\r\npossess guns, and assume to hunt with them. The logical conclusion of\r\nthis is more hunting and less game. The development of the country has\r\nreduced the cover for game. New roads and railways have made the game\r\ndistricts easily accessible, and real sportsmen are now three or four\r\ntimes as numerous as they were in 1877.\r\n\r\nAt Toonacadavoo, in the Animallai Hills where thirty-five years ago\r\nthere modestly nestled on the ridge beside the river only Forest Ranger\r\nTheobold's bungalow, built of mud and covered with grass thatch and\r\nbamboo rats, there is now a regular hill station lighted by electricity,\r\na modern sanatorium high up on the bluff, a _club_, golf links, and\r\nother modern improvements. In my day there were exactly four guns on the\r\nAnimallais. Now there are probably one hundred; and it is easy to guess\r\nhow much big game remains on the Delectable Mountains in comparison with\r\nthe golden days of 1877. I should say that there is now only one game\r\nanimal for every twenty-five that were there in my day.\r\n\r\nI am told that it is like that all over India. Beyond question, the\r\ngun-sellers and gun-users have been busy there, as everywhere else. The\r\ngame of India is on the toboggan slide, and the old days of abundance\r\nhave gone forever.\r\n\r\nThe first fact that strikes us in the face is the impending fate of the\r\ngreat Indian rhinoceros, an animal as wonderful as the Titanothere or\r\nthe Megatherium. It is like a gift handed down to us straight out of the\r\nPleistocene age, a million years back. The British paleontologists\r\nto-day marvel at _Elephas ganesa_, and by great labor dig his bones out\r\nof the Sewalik rocks, but what one of them all has yet made a move to\r\nsave _Rhinoceros indicus_ from the quick extermination that soon will be\r\nhis portion unless he is accorded perpetual and real protection from the\r\nassaults of man?\r\n\r\nLet the mammalogists of the world face this fact. The available cover of\r\nthe Indian rhinoceros is _alarmingly_ decreasing, throughout Assam and\r\nBengal where the behemoth of the jungle has a right to live. It is\r\nbelieved that the few remaining rhinos are being shot much faster then\r\nthey are breeding; and what will be the effect of this upon an animal\r\nthat requires fourteen years to reach full maturity? To-day, the most\r\nwonderful hoofed mammal of all Asia is booked for extermination, and\r\nunless very radical measures for its preservation are at once carried\r\ninto effect, it is probable that twenty years more will see the last\r\nIndian rhino go down to rise no more. One remedy would be a good, ample\r\nrhinoceros preserve; and another, the most absolute and permanent\r\nprotection for the species, all along the line. Half-way measures will\r\nnot suffice. It is time to ring in a general alarm.\r\n\r\nDuring the past eighteen years, only three specimens of that species\r\nhave come out of India for the zoological gardens and parks of the\r\nworld, and I think there are only five in captivity, all told.\r\n\r\nWe are told that in India now the natives are permitted to have about\r\nall the firearms they can pay for. Naturally, in a country containing\r\nover 300,000,000 people this is a deadly thing. Of course there are\r\nshooting regulations, many of them; but their enforcement is so\r\nimperfect that it is said that the natives are attacking the big game on\r\nall sides, with deadly effect. I fear it is utterly impossible for the\r\nIndian government to put enough wardens into the field to watch the\r\ndoings of the grand army of native poachers.\r\n\r\nFortunately, the Indian native,--unlike the western frontiersman,--does\r\nnot contend that _he owns_ the big game, or that \"all men are born free\r\nand equal.\" At the same time, he means to have his full share of it, to\r\neat, and to sell in various forms for cash. Even in India, the\r\nsale-of-game dragon has reared its head, and is to-day in need of being\r\nscotched with an iron hand.\r\n\r\nWhen I received direct from a friend in the native state of Kashmir a\r\nlong printed circular setting forth the hunting laws and game-protective\r\nmeasures of that very interesting principality, it gave me a shock. It\r\nwas disquieting to be thus assured that the big game of Kashmir has\r\ndisappeared to such an extent that strong protective measures are\r\nnecessary. It was as if the Chief Eskimo of Etah had issued a strong\r\nproclamation for the saving of the musk-ox.\r\n\r\nIn Kashmir, the destruction of game has become so serious that a Game\r\nPreservation Department has been created, with the official staff that\r\nsuch an organization requires. The game laws are printed annually, and\r\nany variations from them may be made only by the authority of the\r\nMaharajah himself. Up to date, _eight_ game preserves have been created,\r\nhaving a total area of about thee hundred square miles. In addition to\r\nthese, there are twelve small preserves, each having an area of from\r\ntwenty-five to fifty square miles. By their locations, these seem to\r\nprovide for all the species of big game that are found in Kashmir,--the\r\nibex, two forms of markhor, the tahr. Himalayan bighorn sheep, burrhel\r\nand goral.\r\n\r\nIn our country we have several states that are very large, very\r\ndiversified in surface, and still inhabited by large game. Has any one\r\nof those states created a series of game preserves even half way\r\ncomparable with those of Kashmir? I think not. Montana has made a\r\nbeginning with two preserves,--Snow Creek and the Pryor Mountains,--but\r\nbeside the splendid series of Kashmir they are not worthy of serious\r\nmention.\r\n\r\nAnd then following closely in the wake of that document came a lengthy\r\narticle in the \"Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London,\" by\r\nE.C. Stebbing, in which a correspondent of the Indian _Field_ clearly\r\nsets forth the fact that the big game of the Himalayas now is menaced by\r\na peril new to our consideration, but of a most deadly character. Hear\r\nhim:\r\n\r\n\"In this inventory (of game destroyers in India), the Gurkha soldier\r\ndoes not find a place, for he belongs to a class which he amply fills by\r\nhimself with his small but very important personality. He deserves\r\nseparate notice. From the banks of the Sarda on the frontier of Nepal,\r\nto the banks of the Indus, the battalions of these gallant little men\r\nare scattered in cantonments all along the outer spurs of the Himalayan\r\nrange. In seven or eight of these locations there are at least 14,000 of\r\nthese disciplined warriors, who, in the absence of opportunities for\r\nspilling human blood legitimately, are given a free hand for\r\nslaughtering wild animals, along five-hundred miles of the best hunting\r\ngrounds of Upper India.\"\r\n\r\nNow, since those facts must be true as reported, do they not in\r\nthemselves constitute a severe arraignment of the Indian government? Why\r\nshould that state of game slaughter endure, when a single executive\r\norder to the C.O. of each post would effectually stop it?\r\n\r\nIn the making of game preserves, or \"sanctuaries\" as they are called out\r\nthere, the Government of India has shown rare and commendable diligence.\r\nThe total number is too great for enumeration here. The native state of\r\nMysore has seven, and the Nilgiri Hills have sanctuaries aggregating\r\nabout 100,000 acres in area. In the Wynaad Forest, my old\r\nhunting-grounds at Mudumallay have been closed to bison shooting,\r\nbecause of the alarming decrease of bison (gaur) through shooting and\r\ndisease. The Kundah Forest Reserve has been made a partial game\r\npreserve, but the door might as well have been left wide open as so\r\nwidely ajar.\r\n\r\nIn eastern Bengal and Assam, several game preserves have been created.\r\nOn the whole, by the diligence and thoroughness with which sanctuaries,\r\nas they are termed, have been created quite generally throughout India,\r\nit is quite evident that the government and the sportsmen of India have\r\nbecome thoroughly alarmed by the great decrease of the game, and the\r\ndanger of the extermination of species. In the past India has been the\r\nfinest and best-stocked hunting-ground of all Asia, quite beyond\r\ncompare, and the destruction of her once-splendid fauna of big game\r\nwould be a zoological calamity.\r\n\r\n_Tibet_.--As yet, Tibet offers free hunting, without legal let or\r\nhindrance, to every sportsman who can climb up to her lofty, wind-swept\r\nand whizzing-cold plateau. The man who hunts the _Ovis poli_, superb\r\ncreature though it be, pays in full for his trophies. The ibex of the\r\nsouth help out the compensatory damages, but even with that, the list of\r\nspecies available in southern Tibet is painfully small. The Mitchell\r\ntakin can be reached from China, via Chungking, after a long, hard\r\njourney, over Consul Mason Mitchell's trail; but the takin is about the\r\nonly large hoofed game available.\r\n\r\n_The Altai Mountains_, of western China, contain the magnificent\r\nSiberian argali, the grandfather of all sheep species, whose horns must\r\nbe seen to be believed. Through a quest for that species the Russian\r\nmilitary authorities played upon Mr. George L. Harrison and his comrade\r\na very grim and unsportsmanlike joke. At the frontier military post, on\r\nthe Russo-Chinese border, the two Americans were courteously halted,\r\nhospitably entertained, and _prevented_ from going into the\r\nargali-infested mountains that loomed up before them only a few miles\r\naway! The Russian officers said:\r\n\r\n\"Sheep? Why, if you really want sheep, we will send out some of our\r\nbrave soldiers to shoot some for you; but there is no need for _you_ to\r\ntake the trouble to go after them!\"\r\n\r\nAfter Mr. Harrison and his comrade had spent $5,000, and traveled half\r\nway around the world for those sheep, that is in brief the story of how\r\nthe cup of Tantalus was given them by the Russians, actually _at their\r\ngoal_! As spoil-sports, those Russian officers were the champions of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nSeven hundred miles southeastward of the Altai Mountains of western\r\nChina, guarded by the dangerous hostility of savage native tribes, there\r\nexists and awaits the scientific explorer, according to report, an\r\nundiscovered wild horse. The Bicolored Wild Horse is black and white,\r\nand joy awaits the zoologist or sportsman who sees it first. Evidently\r\nit will not soon be exterminated by modern rifles.\r\n\r\n_The Impenetrable Forests_.--Although the mountains of central Asia will\r\nin time be cleared of their big game,--when by hook and by crook the\r\nnatives secure plenty of modern firearms,--there are places in the Far\r\nEast that we know will contain big game forever and a day. Take the\r\nMalay Peninsula, Borneo and Sumatra as examples.\r\n\r\nMr. C. William Beebe, who recently has visited the Far East, has\r\ndescribed how the state of Selangor, between Malacca and Penang, has\r\ntaken on many airs of improvement since 1878, and sections of Sarawak\r\nTerritory are being cut down and burned for the growing of rubber.\r\nDespite this I am trying to think that those developments menace the\r\ntotal volume of the wild life of those regions but little. I wonder if\r\nthose tangled, illimitable, ever-renewing jungles yet know that their\r\nfaces have been scratched. White men never will exterminate the big game\r\nof the really dense jungles of the eastern tropics; but with enough\r\naxes, snares, guns and cartridges _the natives_ may be able to\r\naccomplish it!\r\n\r\nIn Malayana there are some jungles so dense, so tangled with lianas and\r\nso thorny with Livistonias and rattan that nothing larger than a cat can\r\nmake way through them. There are thousands of square miles so boggy, so\r\nswampy, so dark, gloomy and mosquito-ridden that all men fear them and\r\navoid them, and in them rubber culture must be impossible. In those\r\nsilent places the gaur, the rhino, the Malay sambar, the clouded leopard\r\nand the orang-utan surely are measurably safe from the game-bags and\r\nmarket gunners of the shooting world. It is good to think that there is\r\nan equatorial belt of jungle clear around the world, in Central and\r\nSouth America as well as in the old World, in which there will be little\r\nextermination in our day, except of birds for the feather market. But\r\nthe open plains, open mountains, and open forests of Asia and\r\nAustralasia are in different case. Eventually they will be \"shot out.\"\r\n\r\nChina, all save Yunnan and western Mongolia, is now horribly barren of\r\nwild life. Can it ever be brought back? We think it can not. The\r\nmillions of population are too many; and except in the great forest\r\ntracts, the spread of modern firearms will make an end of the game.\r\nAlready the pheasants are being swept out of China for the London\r\nmarket, and extinction is staring several species in the face. On the\r\nwhole, the pheasants of the Old World are being hit hard by the\r\nrubber-planting craze. Mr. Beebe declares that owing to the inrush of\r\naggressive capital, the haunts of many species of pheasants are being\r\ndenuded of all their natural cover, and some mountain species that are\r\nlimited to small areas are practically certain to be exterminated at an\r\nearly date.\r\n\r\nDESTRUCTION OF ANIMALS FOR FUR.--In the far North, only the interior of\r\nKamchatka seems to be safe from the iron heel of the skin-hunter. A\r\nglance at the list of furs sold in London last year reveals one or two\r\nthings that are disquieting. The total catch of furs for the year 1911\r\nis enormous,--considering the great scarcity of wild life on two\r\ncontinents. Incidentally it must be remembered that every trapper\r\ncarries a gun, and in studying the fur list one needs no help in trying\r\nto imagine the havoc wrought with firearms on the edible wild life of\r\nthe regions that contributed all that fur. I have been told by trappers\r\nthat as a class, trappers are great killers of game.\r\n\r\nIn order that the reader may know by means of definite figures the\r\nextent to which the world is being raked and combed for fur-bearing\r\nanimals, we append below a statement copied from the _Fur News Magazine_\r\nfor November, 1912, of the sales of the largest London fur house during\r\nthe past two years.\r\n\r\nWith varying emotions we call attention to the wombat of Australia,\r\n3,841; grebe, 51,261, and house cat, 92,407. Very nearly all the totals\r\nof Lampson & Co. for each species are much lower for the sales of 1912\r\nthan for those of 1911. Is this fact significant of a steady decline?\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nFURS SOLD BY C.M.

WILLIAM BEEBE\r\nCurator of Birds, New York Zoological Park\r\n\r\n[Footnote G: The observations which furnished this valuable chapter were\r\nmade by Mr. Beebe in 1911 while conducting an expedition in southern\r\nAsia, Borneo and Java for the purpose of studying in life and nature all\r\nthe members of the Pheasant Family inhabiting that region. The results\r\nof these studies and collections will shortly appear in a very complete\r\nmonograph of the Phasianidae.--W.T.H.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn chapter XIII, treating of the \"Extermination of Birds for Women's\r\nHats,\" Dr. Hornaday has dealt fully with the feather and plumage traffic\r\nafter it enters the brokers' hands, and has proved conclusively that the\r\nplumes of egrets are gathered from the freshly killed birds. We may\r\ntrace the course of the plumes and feathers backward through the\r\ntightly-packed bales and boxes in the holds of the vessels to the ports\r\nof the savage lands whence they were shipped; then to the skilful, dark\r\nhands of Mexican peon, Venezuelan Indian, African negro or Asiatic\r\nChinaman or Malay, who stripped the skin from the flesh; and finally to\r\nthe jungle or mountain side or terai where the bird gave up its life to\r\nblowpipe, cross-bow, blunderbuss or carefully set snare.\r\n\r\nIn various trips to Mexico, Venezuela and other countries in the tropics\r\nof the New World I have seen many such scenes, but not until I had\r\ncompleted a seventeen months' expedition in search of pheasants, through\r\nsome twenty wild countries of Asia and the East Indies, did I realize\r\nthe havoc which is being wrought week by week everywhere on the globe.\r\nWhile we were absent even these few months from the great centers of\r\ncivilization, tremendous advances had been made in air-ships and the\r\nthousand and one other modern phases of human development, but evolution\r\nin the world of Nature as we observed it was only destructive--a\r\nworld-wide katabolism--a retrogression often discernible from month to\r\nmonth. We could scarcely repeat the trip and make the same observations\r\nupon pheasants, so rapidly is this group of birds approaching\r\nextinction.\r\n\r\nThe causes of this destruction of wild life are many and diverse, and\r\nresemble one another only in that they all emanate from mankind. To the\r\ncasual traveller the shooting and trapping of birds for millinery\r\npurposes at first seems to hold an insignificant place among the causes.\r\nBut this is only because in many of the larger ports, the protective\r\nlaws are more or less operative and the occupation of the plume hunter\r\nis carried on in secret ways. But it is as far-reaching and insidious\r\nas any; and when we add to the actual number of birds slain, the\r\ncompound interest of eggs grown cold, of young birds perishing slowly\r\nfrom hunger, of the thousands upon thousands of birds which fall wounded\r\nor dead among the thick tropical jungle foliage and are lost, the total\r\nis one of ghastly proportions.\r\n\r\nNot to weaken my argument with too many general statements, let me take\r\nat once some concrete cases. First, that of the Himalayan pheasants and\r\ngame-birds. In a recent interesting article by E.P. Stebbing[H] the\r\npast, present and hoped-for future of game birds and animals in India is\r\nreviewed. Unfortunately, however, most of the finest creatures in Asia\r\nlive beyond the border of the British sphere of influence, and though\r\nwithin sight, are absolutely beyond reach of civilized law. The heart of\r\nthe Himalayas,--the haunts of some of the most beautiful birds in the\r\nworld, the tragopans, the blood and impeyan pheasants--lies within the\r\nlimits of Nepal, a little country which time and time again has bade\r\ndefiance to British attacks, and still maintains its independence. From\r\nits northern border Mt. Everest looks down from its most exalted of all\r\nearthly summits and sees valley after valley depleted of first one bird\r\nand then another. I have seen and lived with Nepalese shepherds who have\r\nnothing to do month after month but watch their flocks. In the lofty\r\nsolitudes time hangs heavy on their hands, and with true oriental\r\npatience they weave loop after loop of yak-hair snares, and then set\r\nthem, not in dozens or scores, but in hundreds and thousands up and down\r\nthe valleys.\r\n\r\n[Footnote H: \"Game Sanctuaries and Game Protection in India,\"\r\nProc. Zool. Soc., London, 1912. pp. 23-35.]\r\n\r\nIn one locality seven great valleys had been completely cleared of\r\npheasants, only a single pair of tragopans remaining; and from one of\r\nthese little brown men I took two hundred nooses which had been prepared\r\nfor these lone survivors. In these cases, the birds were either cooked\r\nand eaten at once, or sold to some passing shepherd or lama for a few\r\nannas. But in other parts of this unknown land systematic collecting of\r\nskins goes on, for bale after bale of impeyan and red argus (tragopan)\r\npheasant skins goes down to the Calcutta wharves, where its infamous\r\ncontents, though known, are safe from seizure under the Nepal Raja's\r\nseal! Thus it is that the London feather sales still list these among\r\nthe most splendid of all living birds. And shame upon shame, when we\r\nread of 80 impeyan skins \"dull,\" or \"slightly defective,\" we know that\r\nthese are female birds. Then, if ever, we realize that the time of the\r\nbird and the beast is passing, the acme of evolution for these wonderful\r\nbeings is reached, and at most we can preserve only a small fragment of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nTo the millinery hunter, what the egret is to America, and the bird of\r\nparadise to New Guinea, the impeyan pheasant is to India--the most\r\ncoveted of all plumages. There is a great tendency to blame the native\r\nhunter for the decrease of this and other pheasants, and from what I\r\nhave personally seen in many parts of the Himalayas there is no question\r\nthat the Garwhalese and Nepalese hill-men have wrought havoc among the\r\nbirds. But these men are by no means the sole cause. As long ago as 1879\r\nwe read that \"The great demand for the brilliant skins of the moonal\r\nthat has existed for many years has led to their almost total\r\nextermination in some parts of the hills, as the native shikaris shoot\r\nand snare for the pot as well as for skins, and kill as many females as\r\nmales. On the other hand, though for nearly thirty years my friend Mr.\r\nWilson has yearly sent home from 1,000 to 1,500 skins of this species\r\nand the tragopan, there are still in the woods whence they were obtained\r\nas many as, if not more than, when he first entered them, simply because\r\nhe has rigidly preserved females and nests, and (as amongst English\r\npheasants) one cock suffices for several hens.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PHEASANT SNARES\r\nMade of Yak Hair, Taken from a Shepherd in Nepal by Mr. Beebe]\r\n\r\nIgnoring the uncertainty of the last statement, it is rather absurd to\r\nthink of a single man \"preserving\" females and nests in the Himalayas\r\nfrom 1850 to 1880, when the British Government, despite most efficient\r\nlaws and worthy efforts is unable to protect the birds of these wild\r\nregions to-day. The statement that after thirty to forty-five thousand\r\ncock impeyans were shot or snared, as many or more than the original\r\nquota remained, could only emanate from the mind of a professional\r\nfeather-hunter, and Hume should not be blamed for more than the mere\r\nrepetition of such figures. Let it be said to the credit of Wilson, the\r\nslaughterer of something near forty-five thousand impeyans, that he was\r\na careful observer of the birds' habits, and has given us an excellent\r\naccount, somewhat coloured by natives, but on the whole, the best we\r\nhave had in the past. But it is not pleasant to read of his waiting\r\nuntil \"twenty or thirty have got up and alighted in the surrounding\r\ntrees, and have then walked up to the different trees and fired at those\r\nI wished to procure without alarming the rest, only those very close to\r\nthe one fired at being disturbed at each report.\"\r\n\r\nHume's opinion that in 1879 there were scores of places where one might\r\nsecure from ten to eighteen birds in a day, is certainly not true\r\nto-day. Indeed, as early as 1858 we read that \"This splendid bird, once\r\nso abundant on the Western Himalayas is now far from being so, in\r\nconsequence of the numbers killed by sportsmen on account of its beauty.\r\nWhole tracts of mountain forest once frequented by the moonal are now\r\nalmost without a single specimen.\" The same author goes on naively to\r\ntell the reader that \"Among the most pleasant reminiscences of bygone\r\ndays is a period of eleven days, spent by the author and a friend on the\r\nChoor Mountain near Simia, when among other trophies were numbered\r\nsixty-eight moonal pheasants, etc.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SILVER PHEASANT SKINS SEIZED AT RANGOON, BRITISH BURMA\r\nAbout 600 Skins out of Several Thousand Confiscated in the Custom House,\r\non their way to the London Feather Market. Photographed by Mr. Beebe]\r\n\r\nFor some unaccountable reason there is, or was for many years, a very\r\nprevalent idea that the enormous number of skins which have poured into\r\nthe London market were from birds bred in the vicinity of Calcutta. When\r\nwe remember the intense heat of that low-lying city, and learn from the\r\nrecords of the Calcutta Zoological Garden that impeyans and tragopans\r\nare even shorter-lived than in Europe, the absurdity of the idea is\r\napparent. In spite of numberless inquiries throughout India, I failed to\r\nlearn of a single captive young bird ever hatched and reared even in the\r\nhigh, cool, hill-stations. The commercial value of an impeyan skin has\r\nvaried from five dollars to twenty dollars, according to the number\r\nreceived annually. In 1876 an estimate placed the monthly average of\r\nimpeyans received in London at from two to eight hundred.\r\n\r\nIn such a case as Nepal, direct protective laws are of no avail. All\r\nhumane arguments are useless, but if the markets at the other end _can\r\nbe closed_, the slaughter will cease instantly and automatically.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DEADFALL TRAPS IN BURMA\r\nA Long Series set Across a Valley, by the Kachins of the Burma-Chinese\r\nBorder. A Wholesale Method of Wild-life Slaughter, Photographed by C.\r\nWilliam Beebe, 1910]\r\n\r\nAs a contrast to the millinery hunter of fifty years ago it is\r\nrefreshing to find that at last sincere efforts are being made in\r\nBritish possessions to stop this traffic. I happened to be at Rangoon\r\nwhen six large bales of pheasant skins were seized by the Custom\r\nofficials. A Chinaman had brought them from Yunnan via Bhamo, and was\r\npreparing to ship them as ducks' feathers. Two of the bales were opened\r\nfor my inspection. The first contained about five hundred Lady Amherst\r\npheasant skins, falling to pieces and lacking heads and legs. The second\r\nheld over four hundred silver pheasants, in almost perfect condition.\r\nThe chief collector had put the absolutely prohibitive fine of 200\r\npounds on them, and was waiting for the expiration of the legal number\r\nof days before burning the entire lot. They must have represented years\r\nof work in decimating the pheasant fauna of western China.\r\n\r\nFar up in the wilderness of northern Burma, and over the Yunnan border,\r\nwe often came upon some of the most ingenious examples of native\r\ntrapping, a system which we found repeated in the Malay States, Borneo,\r\nChina and other parts of the Far East. A low bamboo fence is built\r\ndirectly across a steep valley or series of valleys, about half way from\r\nthe summit to the lower end, and about every fifteen feet a narrow\r\nopening is left, over which a heavy log is suspended. Any creature\r\nattempting to make its way through, treads upon several small sticks and\r\nby so doing springs the trap and the dead-fall claims a victim. When a\r\ncountry is systematically strung with traps such as these, sooner or\r\nlater all but a pitiful remnant of the smaller mammals, birds and\r\nreptiles are certain to be wiped out. Morning after morning I have\r\nvisited such a runway and found dead along its path, what must have been\r\nall the walking, running or crawling creatures which the night before\r\nhad sought the water at the bottom; pheasants, cobras, mouse-deer,\r\nrodents, civets, and members of many other groups. In some countries\r\nnooses instead of dead-falls guard the openings, but the result is\r\nequally deadly.\r\n\r\nI have described this method of trapping because of its future\r\nimportance in the destruction of wild life in the Far East. The Chinaman\r\nin all his many millions is undergoing a remarkably swift and radical\r\nevolution both of character and dress. In many ways, if only from the\r\nviewpoint of the patient, thrifty store-keeper he is a most powerful\r\nfactor in the East, and is becoming more so. In many cases he imitates\r\nthe white nations by cutting off his queue and altering his dress. In\r\nsome mysterious correlated way his diet seems simultaneously affected,\r\nand while for untold generations rice and fish has satisfied all his\r\ngastronomic desires, a new craving, that for meat, has come to him. The\r\nresult is apparent in many parts of the East. The Chinaman is willing\r\nand able to pay for meat, and the native finds a new market for the\r\ncreatures about him. Again and again when I wished a few specimens of\r\nsome certain pheasant I had but to hail passing canoes and bid a few\r\nannas or \"cash\" or \"ringits\" higher than the prospective Chinese\r\npurchaser would give, and the pheasants were mine.\r\n\r\nIn the catalogues of the brokers' sales of feathers we read of many\r\nthousands of the wonderful ocellated wing feathers of the argus\r\npheasant, but no less horrible is the sight of a canoe crammed with the\r\nbedraggled bodies of these magnificent birds on their way to some\r\nChinese hamlet where they will be sold for a pittance, the flesh eaten\r\nto the last tendon and the feathers given to the children and puppies to\r\nplay with. The newly-aroused appetite of the Mongolian will soon be an\r\nimportant factor in the extermination of animals and birds, few species\r\nbeing exempt, for the Chinaman lives up to his reputation and is not\r\nsqueamish as to the nature of his meat.\r\n\r\nBefore we leave the subject of Chinamen let us consider another recent\r\nfactor in the destruction of wild life which is at present widely\r\noperative in China itself. This is the cold storage warehouse, of which\r\nsix or eight enormous ones have gone up in different parts of the East.\r\nTo speak in detail only of the one at Hankow, six hundred miles up the\r\nYangtze, we found it to be the largest structure in the city. Surrounded\r\nby a high wall, with each entrance and exit guarded by armed Sikhs, it\r\nseemed like the feudal castle of some medieval baron. Why such secrecy\r\nis necessary I could not learn, as there are no laws against its\r\nbusiness. But so carefully guarded is its premises that until a short\r\ntime ago even the British consul-general of Hankow had not been allowed\r\nto enter. He, however, at last refused to sign the papers for any more\r\noutgoing shipments until he should be allowed to see what was going on\r\nwithin the warehouse. I hoped to be able to look over some of the frozen\r\npheasants for interesting scientific material, but of course was not\r\nallowed to do so.\r\n\r\nAlthough here in the heart of China, outside changes are not felt so\r\nstrongly and the newly-acquired meat diet of the border and emigrant\r\nChinese is hardly apparent, these warehouses have opened up a new source\r\nof revenue, which has met with instant response. Thousands and tens of\r\nthousands of wild shot or trapped pheasants and other birds are now\r\nbrought to these establishments by the natives from far and near. The\r\nbirds are frozen, and twice a year shipped on specially refrigerated P.\r\nand O. steamships to England and the continent of Europe where they seem\r\nto find a ready sale. Pigs and chickens also figure in the shipments.\r\nNow the pheasants have for centuries existed in enormous numbers in the\r\nendless ricefields of China, without doing any damage to the crops. In\r\nfact they could not be present in such numbers without being an\r\nimportant factor in keeping down insect and other enemies of the grain.\r\nWhen their numbers are decimated as they are being at present, there\r\nmust eventually result a serious upsetting of the balance of nature. Let\r\nus hope that in some way this may be avoided, and that the present\r\nfamine deaths of thirty thousand or more in some provinces will not be\r\nincreased many fold.\r\n\r\nWhen I started on this search for pheasants I was repeatedly told by old\r\nexplorers in the east that my task would be very different from theirs\r\nof thirty years ago; that I would find steamers, railroads and\r\nautomobiles where formerly were only canoes and jungle. I indeed found\r\nthis as reported, but while my task was different it was made no easier.\r\nFormerly, to be sure, one had from the start to paddle slowly or push\r\nalong the trails made by natives or game animals. But then the wild life\r\nwas encountered at once, while I found it always far from the end of the\r\nsteamer's route or the railroad's terminal, and still to be reached only\r\nby the most primitive modes of travel.\r\n\r\nI cite this to give point to my next great cause of destruction; the\r\nburning and clearing of vast stretches of country for the planting of\r\nrubber trees. The East seems rubber mad, and whether the enormous output\r\nwhich will result from the millions of trees set out month after month\r\nwill be profitable, I cannot say. I can think only of the vanishing of\r\nthe _entire fauna_ and _flora_ of many districts which I have seen as a\r\ndirect result of this commercial activity. One leaves Port Swettenham on\r\nthe west coast of Selangor, and for the hour's run to Kuala Lumpur sees\r\nhardly anything but vast radiating lines of spindling rubber trees, all\r\nunderbrush cleared, all native growths vanished. From Kuala Lumpur to\r\nKuala Kubu at the very foot of the mountain backbone of the Malay\r\nPeninsula, the same holds true. And where some area appears not under\r\ncultivation, the climbing fern and a coarse, useless \"lalang\" grass\r\ncovers every inch of ground. One can hardly imagine a more complete\r\nblotting out of the native fauna and flora of any one limited region.\r\nAnd ever-extending roads for the increasing motor cars are widening the\r\ncleared zone, mile after mile to the north and south.\r\n\r\nIn this region, as we pushed on over the mountains into the wilderness\r\nof Pahang, we saw little of the actual destruction of the primeval\r\nnative growth, but elsewhere it became a common sight. Once, for many\r\ndays we studied the wonderful life of a jungle which stretched up to our\r\nvery camp. Troops of rollicking wa-was or gibbons frequented the forest;\r\nsquirrels, tupaias, birds and insects in myriads were everywhere during\r\nthe day. Great fruit-bats, flying lemurs, owls and other nocturnal\r\ncreatures made the evenings and nights full of interest.\r\n\r\nAnd then, one day without warning came the sound of an ax, and another\r\nand another. From that moment the songs, cries, chirps and roars of the\r\njungle were seldom heard from our camp. Every day saw new phalanxes of\r\nsplendid primeval trees fallen, or half suspended in their rigging of\r\nlianas. The leaves withered, the flower petals fell and we heard no more\r\nthe crackling of bamboos in the wind. Then the pitiful survivors of the\r\ndestruction were brought to us; now a baby flying lemur, flung from its\r\nhole by the falling of some tree; young tupaias, nestling birds; a few\r\nout of the thousands of creatures from insects to mammals which were\r\nslain so that a Chinaman or Malay might eke a few dollars, four or five\r\nyears hence, from a grove of rubber trees. I do not say it is wrong. Man\r\nhas won out, and might is right, as since the dawn of creation; but to\r\nthe onlooker, to the lover of nature and the animal world it is a\r\nterrible, a hopeless thing.\r\n\r\nOne cannot at present leave the tourist line of travel in the East\r\nwithout at once encountering evidence of the wholesale direct slaughter\r\nof wild life, or its no less certain extermination by the elimination of\r\nthe haunts and the food plants of the various beasts and birds.\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nTHE SAVAGE VIEW-POINT OF THE GUNNER\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mental attitude of the men who shoot constitutes a deadly factor in\r\nthe destruction of wild life and the extermination of species. Fully\r\nninety-five per cent of the sportsmen, gunners and other men and boys\r\nwho kill game, all over the world and in all nations, regard game birds\r\nand mammals only as things to be killed _and eaten_, and not as\r\ncreatures worth preserving for their beauty or their interest to\r\nmankind. This is precisely the viewpoint of the cave-man and the savage,\r\nand it has come down from the Man-with-a-Club to the Man-with-a-Gun\r\nabsolutely unchanged save for one thing: the latter sometimes is\r\nprompted to save to-day in order to slaughter to-morrow.\r\n\r\nThe above statement of an existing fact may seem harsh; and some persons\r\nmay be startled by it; but it is based on an acquaintance with thousands\r\nof men who shoot all kinds of game, all over the world. My critics\r\nsurely will admit that my opportunities to meet the sportsmen and\r\ngunners of the world are, and for thirty-five years have been, rather\r\nfavorable. As a matter of fact, I think the efforts of the hunters of my\r\npersonal acquaintance have covered about seven-tenths of the hunting\r\ngrounds of the world. If the estimate that I have formed of the average\r\nhunter's viewpoint is wrong, or even partially so, I will be glad to\r\nhave it proven in order that I may reform my judgment and apologize.\r\n\r\nIn working with large bodies of bird-shooting sportsmen I have\r\nsteadily--and also painfully--been impressed by their intentness on.\r\nkilling, and by the fact that _they seek to preserve game only to kill\r\nit!_ Who ever saw a bird-shooter rise in a convention and advocate the\r\npreservation of any species of game bird on account of its beauty or its\r\nesthetic interest _alive?_ I never did; and I have sat in many\r\nconventions of sportsmen. All the talk is of open seasons, bag limits\r\nand killing rights. The man who has the hardihood to stand up and\r\npropose a five-year close season has \"a hard row to hoe.\" Men rise and\r\nsay: \"It's all nonsense! There's plenty of quail shooting on Long Island\r\nyet.\"\r\n\r\nThroughout the length and breadth of America, the ruling passion is to\r\nkill as long as anything killable remains. The man who will openly\r\nadvocate the stopping of quail-shooting because the quails are of such\r\ngreat value to the farmers, or because they are so _beautiful_ and\r\ncompanionable to man, receives no sympathy from ninety per cent of the\r\nbird-killing sportsmen. The remaining ten per cent think seriously about\r\nthe matter, and favor long close seasons. It is my impression that of\r\nthe men who shoot, it is only among the big-game hunters that we find\r\nmuch genuine admiration for game animals, or any feeling remotely\r\nresembling regard for it.\r\n\r\nThe moment that a majority of American gunners concede the fact that\r\ngame birds are worth preserving for their beauty, and their value as\r\nliving neighbors to man, from that moment there is hope for the saving\r\nof the Remnant. That will indeed be the beginning of a new era, of a\r\nmillennium in fact, in the preservation of wild life. It will then be\r\neasy to enact laws for ten-year close seasons on whole groups of\r\nspecies. Think what it would mean for such a close season to be enacted\r\nfor all the grouse of the United States, all the shore-birds of the\r\nUnited States, or the wild turkey wherever found!\r\n\r\nTo-day, the great--indeed, the _only_--opponents of long close seasons\r\non game birds are the gunners. Whenever and wherever you introduce a\r\nbill to provide such a season, you will find that this is true. The gun\r\nclubs and the Downtrodden Hunters' and Anglers' Protective Associations\r\nwill be quick to go after their representatives, and oppose the bill.\r\nAnd state senators and assemblymen will think very hard and with strong\r\ncourage before they deliberately resolve to do their duty regardless of\r\nthe opposition of \"a large body of sportsmen,\"--men who have votes, and\r\nwho know how to take revenge on lawmakers who deprive them of their\r\n\"right\" to kill. The greatest speech ever made in the Mexican Congress\r\nwas uttered by the member who solemnly said: \"I rise to sacrifice\r\nambition to honor!\"\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the men who shoot have become possessed of the idea that\r\nthey have certain inherent, God-given \"rights\" to kill game! Now, as a\r\nmatter of fact, a sportsman with a one-hundred-dollar Fox gun in his\r\nhands, a two-hundred-dollar dog at his heels and five one-hundred-dollar\r\nbills in his pocket has no more \"right\" to kill a covey of quail on Long\r\nIsland than my milkman has to elect that it shall be let alone for the\r\npleasure of his children! The time has come when the people who don't\r\nshoot must do one of two things:\r\n\r\n1. They must demonstrate the fact that they have rights in the wild\r\ncreatures, and demand their recognition, or\r\n\r\n2. See the killable game all swept off the continent by the Army of\r\nDestruction.\r\n\r\nReally, it is to me very strange that gunners never care to save game\r\nbirds on account of their beauty. One living bob white on a fence is\r\nbetter than a score in a bloody game-bag. A live squirrel in a tree is\r\npoetry in motion; but on the table a squirrel is a rodent that tastes as\r\na rat smells. Beside the ocean a flock of sandpipers is needed to\r\ncomplete the beautiful picture; but on the table a sandpiper is beneath\r\ncontempt. A live deer trotting over a green meadow, waving a triangular\r\nwhite flag, is a sight to thrill any human ganglion; but a deer lying\r\ndead,--unless it has an exceptionally fine head,--is only so much\r\nbutcher's meat.\r\n\r\nOne of the finest sights I ever saw in Montana was a big flock of sage\r\ngrouse slowly stalking over a grassy flat thinly sprinkled with\r\nsage-brush. It was far more inspiring than any pile of dead birds that I\r\never saw. I remember scores of beautiful game birds that I have seen and\r\nnot killed; but of all the game birds that I have eaten or tried to eat\r\nin New York, I remember with sincere pleasure only _one_. Some of the\r\nancient cold-storage candidates I remember \"for cause,\" as the lawyers\r\nsay.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ONE MORNING'S CATCH OF TROUT, NEAR SPOKANE\r\nAnother Line of Extermination According to law. Three Times too Many\r\nFish for one rod. In those Cold Mountain Streams, Fish Grow Slowly, and\r\na Stream is Quickly \"Fished out\"]\r\n\r\nSportsmen and gunners, for God's sake elevate your viewpoint of the\r\ngame of the world. Get out of the groove in which man has run ever since\r\nthe days of Adam! There is something in a game bird over and above its\r\npound of flesh. You don't \"need\" the meat any longer; for you don't know\r\nwhat hunger is, save by reading of it. Try the field-glass and the\r\ncamera, instead of the everlasting gun. Any fool can take a five-dollar\r\ngun and kill a bird; but it takes a genius to photograph one wild bird\r\nand get \"a good one.\" As hunters, the camera men have the best of it.\r\nOne good live-bird photograph is more of a trophy and a triumph than a\r\nbushel of dead birds. The birds and mammals now are literally dying for\r\n_your_ help in the making of long close seasons, and in the real\r\nstoppage of slaughter. Can you not hear the call of the wild remnant?\r\n\r\nIt is time for the people who don't shoot to call a halt on those who\r\ndo; \"and if this be treason, then let my enemies make the most of it!\"\r\n\r\nSince the above was written, I have read in the _Outdoor World_ for\r\nApril, 1912, the views of a veteran sportsman and writer, Mr. Emerson\r\nHough, on the wild-life situation as it seems to him to-day. It is a\r\nstrong utterance, even though it reaches a pessimistic and gloomy\r\nconclusion which I do not share. Altogether, however, its breadth of\r\nview, its general accuracy, and its incisiveness, entitle it to a full\r\nhearing. The following is only an extract from a lengthy article\r\nentitled, \"God's Acre:\"\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\n  EMERSON HOUGH'S VIEW OF THE SITUATION\r\n\r\n  The truth is none the less the truth because it is unpleasant to\r\n  face. There is no well posted sportsman in America, no manufacturer\r\n  of sporting goods in America, no man well versed in American outdoor\r\n  matters, who does not know that we are at the evening of the day of\r\n  open sport in America. Our old ways have failed, all of them have\r\n  failed. The declining fortunes of the best sportsman's journals of\r\n  America would prove that, if proof were asked. Our sportsmanship has\r\n  failed. Our game laws have failed, and we know they have failed. Our\r\n  game is almost gone, and we know it is almost gone. America has\r\n  changed and we know that it has changed, although we have not\r\n  changed with it. The old America is done and it is gone, and we know\r\n  that to be the truth. The old order passeth, and we know that the\r\n  new order must come soon if it is to work any salvation for our wild\r\n  game and our life in the open in pursuit of it.\r\n\r\n  There are many reasons for this fact, these facts. Perhaps the\r\n  greatest lies in the steady advance of civilization into the\r\n  wilderness, the usurpation for agricultural or industrial use of\r\n  many of the ancient breeding and feeding places of the wild game.\r\n  All over the West and now all over Canada, the plow advances, that\r\n  one engine which cannot be gainsaid, which never turns a backward\r\n  furrow.\r\n\r\n  Another great agency is the rapid perfection of transportation all\r\n  over the world. Take the late influx of East African literature. If\r\n  there really were not access to that country we would not have this\r\n  literature, would not have so many pictures from that country. And\r\n  if even Africa will soon be overrun, if even Africa soon will be\r\n  shot out, what hope is there for the game of the wholly accessible\r\n  North American continent?\r\n\r\n  It is all too easy now for the slaughterer to get to his work, all\r\n  too easy for him to transport the fruits of the slaughter. At the\r\n  hands of the ignorant, the unscrupulous and the unsparing, our game\r\n  has steadily disappeared until it is almost gone. We have handled it\r\n  in a wholly greedy, unscrupulous and selfish fashion. This has been\r\n  our policy as a nation. If there is to be success for any plan to\r\n  remedy this, it must come from a few large-minded men, able to think\r\n  and plan, and able to do more than that--to follow their plans with\r\n  deeds.\r\n\r\n  I have seen the whole story of modern American sportsmanship, so\r\n  called. It has been class legislation and organized\r\n  selfishness--that is what it has been, and nothing else. I do not\r\n  blame country legislators, game dealers, farmers, for calling the\r\n  sportsmen of America selfish and thoughtless. I do not blame them\r\n  for saying that the so-called protective measures advanced by\r\n  sportsmen have been selfish measures, and looking to destruction\r\n  rather than to protection. At least that has been their actual\r\n  result. I have no more reverence for a sportsman than for anyone\r\n  else, and no reverence for him at all because he is or calls himself\r\n  a sportsman. He has got to be a man. He has got to be a citizen.\r\n\r\n  I have seen millions of acres of breeding and feeding grounds pass\r\n  under the drain and under the plow in my own time, so that the\r\n  passing whisper of the wild fowl's wing has been forgotten there now\r\n  for many years. I have seen a half dozen species of fine game birds\r\n  become extinct in my own time and lost forever to the American\r\n  people.\r\n\r\n  And you and I have seen one protective society after another,\r\n  languidly organized, paying in a languid dollar or so per capita\r\n  each year, and so swiftly passing, also to be forgotten. We have\r\n  seen one code and the other of conflicting and wholly selfish game\r\n  laws passed, and seen them mocked at and forgotten, seen them all\r\n  fail, as we all know.\r\n\r\n  We have seen even the nation's power--under that Ark of the Covenant\r\n  known as the Interstate Commerce Act--fail to stop wholly the\r\n  lessening of our wild game, so rapidly disappearing for so many\r\n  reasons.\r\n\r\n  We have seen both selfish and unselfish sportsmen's journals attempt\r\n  to solve this problem and fail to do so. Some of them were great and\r\n  broad-minded journals. Their record has not been one of disgrace,\r\n  although it has been one of defeat; for some of them really desired\r\n  success more than they desired dividends. These, all of them, bore\r\n  their share of a great experiment, an experiment in a new land,\r\n  under a new theory of government, a theory which says a man should\r\n  be able to restrain himself, and to govern himself. Only by\r\n  following their theory through to the end of that experiment could\r\n  they know that it was to fail in one of its most vitally interesting\r\n  and vitally important phases.\r\n\r\n  But now, as we know, all of these agencies, selfish or unselfish,\r\n  have failed to effect the salvation of American wild game. Not by\r\n  any scheme, device, or theory, not by any panacea can the old days\r\n  of America be brought back to us.\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nMr. Hough's views are entitled to respectful consideration; but on one\r\nvital point I do not follow him.\r\n\r\nI believe most sincerely--in fact, _I know_,--that it is _possible_ to\r\nmake a few new laws which, in addition to the many, many good protective\r\nlaws we already have, will bring back the game, just as fast and as far\r\nas man's settlements, towns, railroads, mines and schemes in general\r\never can permit it to come back.\r\n\r\nIf the American People as a whole elect that our wild life shall be\r\nsaved, and to a reasonable extent brought back, then by the Eternal it\r\nwill be saved and brought back! The road lies straight before us, and\r\nthe going is easy--_if_ the Mass makes up its mind to act. But on one\r\nvital point Mr. Hough is right. The sportsman alone never will save the\r\ngame! The people who do not kill must act, independently.\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nPART II.--PRESERVATION\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nOUR ANNUAL LOSSES BY INSECTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You take my life when you do take the means whereby I live.\"\r\n\r\n\"In no country in the world,\" says Mr. C.L. Marlatt, of the U.S.\r\nDepartment of Agriculture, \"do insects impose a heavier tax on farm\r\nproducts than in the United States.\" These attacks are based upon an\r\nenormous and varied annual output of cereals and fruits, and a great\r\nvariety and number of trees. For every vegetable-eating insect, native\r\nand foreign, we seem to have crops, trees and plant food galore; and\r\ntheir ravages rob the market-basket and the dinner-pail. In 1912 there\r\nwere riots in the streets of New York over the high cost of food.\r\n\r\nIn 1903, this state of fact was made the subject of a special inquiry by\r\nthe Department of Agriculture, and in the \"Yearbook\" for 1904, the\r\nreader will find, on page 461, an article entitled, \"The Annual Loss\r\nOccasioned by Destructive Insects in the United States.\" The article is\r\nnot of the sensational type, it was not written in an alarmist spirit,\r\nbut from beginning to end it is a calm, cold-blooded analysis of\r\nexisting facts, and the conclusions that fairly may be drawn from them.\r\nThe opinions of several experts have been considered and quoted, and\r\noften their independent figures are stated.\r\n\r\nWith the disappearance of our birds generally, and especially the\r\nslaughter of song and other insect-eating birds both in the South and\r\nNorth, the destruction of the national wealth by insects forges to the\r\nfront as a subject of vital importance. The logic of the situation is so\r\nsimple a child can see it. Short crops mean higher prices. If ten per\r\ncent of our vegetable food supply is destroyed by insects, as certain as\r\nfate we will feel it _in the increased cost of living_.\r\n\r\nI would like to place Mr. Marlatt's report in the hands of every man,\r\nboy and school-teacher in America; but I have not at my disposal the\r\nmeans to accomplish such a task. I cannot even print it here in full,\r\nbut the vital facts can be stated, briefly and in plain figures.\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nCROPS AND INSECTS.\r\n\r\nCORN.--The principal insect enemies of corn are the chinch bug,\r\ncorn-root worm (_Diabrotica longicornis_), bill bug, wire worm,\r\nboll-worm or ear-worm, cut-worm, army worm, stalk worm, grasshopper,\r\nand plant lice, in all a total of about fifty important species! Several\r\nof these pests work secretly. At husking time the wretched ear-worm that\r\nruins the terminal quarter or fifth of an immense number of ears, is\r\npainfully in evidence. The root-worms work insidiously, and the moles\r\nand shrews are supposed to attack them and destroy them. The corn-root\r\nworm is charged with causing an annual loss of two per cent of the corn\r\ncrop, or $20,000,000; the chinch bug another two per cent; the boll or\r\near-worm two per cent more. The remaining insect pests are charged with\r\ntwo per cent, which makes eight per cent in all, or a total of\r\n$80,000,000 lost each year to the American farmer through the ravages of\r\ninsects. This is not evenly distributed, but some areas suffer more than\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CUT-WORM, (_Peridroma Sancia_)\r\nVery Destructive to Crops]\r\n\r\nWHEAT.--Of all our cereal crops, wheat is the one that suffers most from\r\ninsects. There are three insects that cause to the wheat industry an\r\nannual loss of about ten per cent. The _chinch bug_ is the worst, and it\r\nis charged with five per cent ($20,000,000) of the total loss. The\r\n_Hessian fly_ comes next in order, and occasionally rolls up enormous\r\nlosses. In the year 1900, that insect caused to Indiana and Ohio alone\r\nthe loss of 2,577,000 _acres_ of wheat, and the total cost to us of that\r\ninsect in that year \"undoubtedly approached $100,000,000.\" Did that\r\naffect the price of wheat or not? If not, then there is no such thing as\r\na \"law of supply and demand.\"\r\n\r\n_Wheat plant-lice_ form collectively the third insect pest destructive\r\nto wheat, of which it is reported that \"the annual loss occasioned by\r\nwheat plant-lice probably does not fall short of two or three per cent\r\nof the crop.\"\r\n\r\nHAY AND FORAGE CROPS.--These are attacked by locusts, grasshoppers, army\r\nworms, cut-worms, web worms, small grass worms and leaf hoppers. Some of\r\nthese pests are so small and work so insidiously that even the farmer is\r\nprone to overlook their existence. \"A ten per cent shrinkage from these\r\nand other pests in grasses and forage plants is a minimum estimate.\"\r\n\r\nCOTTON.--The great enemies of the cotton-planter are the cotton boll\r\nweevil, the bollworm and the leaf worm; but other insects inflict\r\nserious damage. In 1904 the loss occasioned by the boll weevil, chiefly\r\nin Texas, was conservatively estimated by an expert, Mr. W.D. Hunter, at\r\n$20,000,000. The boll worm of the southwestern cotton states has\r\nsometimes caused an annual loss of $12,000,000, or four per cent of the\r\ncrops in the states affected. Before the use of arsenical poisons, the\r\nleaf worm caused an annual loss of from twenty to thirty million\r\ndollars; but of late years that total has been greatly reduced.\r\n\r\nFRUITS.--The insects that reduce our annual fruit crop attack every\r\nportion of the tree and its product. The woolly aphis attacks the roots\r\nof the fruit tree, the trunk and limbs are preyed upon by millions of\r\nscale insects and borers, the leaves are devastated by the all-devouring\r\nleaf worms, canker worms and tent caterpillars, while the fruit itself\r\nis attacked by the codling moth, curculio and apple maggot. To destroy\r\nfruit is to take money out of the farmer's pocket, and to attack and\r\ninjure the tree is like undermining his house itself. By an annual\r\nexpenditure of about $8,250,000 in cash for spraying apple trees, the\r\ndestructiveness of the codling moth and curculio have been greatly\r\nreduced, but that money is itself a cash loss. Add to this the\r\n$12,000,000 of actual shrinkage in the apple crop, and the total annual\r\nloss to our apple-growers due to the codling moth and curculio is about\r\n$20,000,000. In the high price of apples, a part of this loss falls upon\r\nthe consumer.\r\n\r\nIn 1889 Professor Forbes calculated that the annual loss to the\r\nfruit-growers of Illinois from insect ravages was $2,375,000. In 1892,\r\ninsects caused to Nebraska apple-growers a loss computed at $2,000,000\r\nand, in 1897, New York farmers lost $2,500,000 from that cause. \"In many\r\nsections of the Pacific Northwest the loss was from fifty to\r\nseventy-five per cent.\" (Yearbook, page 470.)\r\n\r\nFORESTS.--\"The annual losses occasioned by insect pests to forests and\r\nforest products (in the United States) have been estimated by Dr. A.D.\r\nHopkins, special agent in charge of forest insect investigations, at not\r\nless than $100,000,000.... It covers both the loss from insect\r\ndamages to standing timber, and to the crude and manufactured forest\r\nproducts. The annual loss to growing timber is conservatively placed at\r\n$70,000,000.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GYPSY MOTH, (_Portheria dispar_)\r\nVery Destructive to the Finest Shade Trees]\r\n\r\nThere are other insect damages that we will not pause to enumerate\r\nhere. They relate to cattle, horses, sheep and stored grain products of\r\nmany kinds. Even cured tobacco has its pest, a minute insect known as\r\nthe cigarette beetle, now widespread in America and \"frequently the\r\ncause of very heavy losses.\"\r\n\r\nThe millions of the insect world are upon us. Their cost to us has been\r\nsummed up by Mr. Marlatt in the table that appears below.\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nANNUAL VALUES OF FARM PRODUCTS, AND LOSSES CHARGEABLE\r\nTO INSECT PESTS.\r\n\r\n_Official Report in the Yearbook of the Department of Agriculture,\r\n1904_.\r\n\r\n                                       % OF\r\n  PRODUCT              VALUE            LOSS    AMOUNT OF LOSS\r\n\r\n Cereals              $2,000,000,000     10      $200,000,000\r\n Hay                     530,000,000     10        53,000,000\r\n Cotton                  600,000,000     10        60,000,000\r\n Tobacco                  53,000,000     10         5,300,000\r\n Truck Crops             265,000,000     20        53,000,000\r\n Sugars                   50,000,000     10         5,000,000\r\n Fruits                  135,000,000     20        27,000,000\r\n Farm Forests            110,000,000     10        11,000,000\r\n Miscellaneous Crops      58,000,000     10         5,800,000\r\n\r\n Total                $3,801,000,000             $420,100,000\r\n\r\n Animal Products       1,750,000,000     10       175,000,000\r\n Natural Forests and                              100,000,000\r\n   Forest Products\r\n Products in Storage                              100,000,000\r\n\r\n GRAND TOTAL          $5,551,000,000             $795,100,000\r\n\r\nThe millions of the insect world are upon us. The birds fight them for\r\nus, and when the birds are numerous and have nestlings to feed, the\r\nnumber of insects they consume is enormous. They require absolutely\r\nnothing at our hands save _the privilege of being let alone while they\r\nwork for us!_ In fighting the insects, our only allies in nature are the\r\nsongbirds, woodpeckers, shore-birds, swallows and martins, certain\r\nhawks, moles, shrews, bats, and a few other living creatures. All these\r\nwage war at their own expense. The farmers might just as well lose\r\n$8,250,000 through a short apple crop as to pay out that sum in labor\r\nand materials in spraying operations. And yet, fools that we are, we go\r\non slaughtering our friends, and allowing others to slaughter them,\r\nunder the same brand of fatuous folly that leads the people of Italy to\r\nbuild anew on the smoking sides of Vesuvius, after a dozen generations\r\nhave been swept away by fire and ashes.\r\n\r\nIn the next chapter we will consider the work of our friends, The Birds.\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nTHE ECONOMIC VALUE OF BIRDS\r\n\r\n\r\nTo-day, from Halifax to Los Angeles, and from Key West to Victoria, a\r\ndeadly contest is being waged. The fruit-growers, farmers, forest owners\r\nand \"park people\" are engaged in a struggle with the insect hordes for\r\nthe possession of the trees, shrubs and crops. Go out into the open,\r\nwith your eyes open, and you will see it for yourself. Millions of\r\ndollars are being expended in it. Look at this exhibit of what is going\r\non around me, at this very moment,--July 19, 1912:\r\n\r\nThe bag insects, in thousands, are devouring the leaves of locust and\r\nmaple trees.\r\n\r\nThe elm beetles are trying to devour the elms; and spraying is in\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nThe hickory-bark borers are slaughtering the hickories; and even some\r\npark people are neglecting to take the measures necessary to stop it!\r\n\r\nThe tent caterpillars are being burned.\r\n\r\nThe aphis (scale insects) are devouring the tops of the _white potatoes_\r\nin the New York University school garden, just as the potato beetle\r\ndoes.\r\n\r\nThe codling moth larvae are already at work on the apples.\r\n\r\nThe leaves affected by the witch hazel gall fly are being cut off and\r\nburned.\r\n\r\nThese are merely the most conspicuous of the insect pests that I now see\r\ndaily. I am not counting those of second or third-rate importance.\r\n\r\nSome of these hordes are being fought with poisonous sprays, some are\r\nbeing killed by hand, and some are being ignored.\r\n\r\nIn view of the known value of the remaining trees of our country, each\r\nwoodpecker in the United States is worth twenty dollars in cash. Each\r\nnuthatch, creeper and chickadee is worth from five to ten dollars,\r\naccording to local circumstances. You might just as well cut down four\r\ntwenty-inch trees and let them lie and decay, as to permit one\r\nwoodpecker to be killed and eaten by an Italian in the North, or a negro\r\nin the South. The downy woodpecker is the relentless enemy of the\r\ncodling moth, an insect that annually inflicts upon our apple crop\r\ndamages estimated by the experts of the U.S. Department of Agriculture\r\nat twelve million dollars!\r\n\r\nNow, is a federal strong-arm migratory bird law needed for such birds or\r\nnot? Let the owners of orchards and forests make answer.\r\n\r\nTHE CASE OF THE CODLING MOTH AND CURCULIO.--The codling moth and\r\ncurculio are twin terrors to apple-growers, partly because of their\r\ndeadly destructiveness, and partly because man is so weak in resisting\r\nthem. The annual cost of the fight made against them, in sprays and\r\nlabor and apparatus, has been estimated at $8,250,000. And what do the\r\nbirds do to the codling moth,--when there are any birds left alive to\r\noperate? The testimony comes from all over the United States, and it is\r\nworth while to cite it briefly as a fair sample of the work of the birds\r\nupon this particularly deadly pest. These facts and quotations are from\r\nthe \"Yearbook of the Department of Agriculture,\" for 1911.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DOWNY WOODPECKER]\r\n\r\n_The Downy Woodpecker_ is the champion tree-protector, and also one of\r\nthe greatest enemies of the codling moth. When man is quite unable to\r\nfind the hidden larvae, Downy locates it every time, and digs it out. It\r\nextracts worms from young apples so skillfully that often the fruit is\r\nnot permanently injured. Mr. F.M. Webster reports that the labors of\r\nthis bird \"afford actual and immediate relief to the infected fruit.\"\r\nTestimony in favor of the downy woodpecker has come from New York, New\r\nJersey, Texas and California, \"and no fewer than twenty larvae have been\r\ntaken from a single stomach.\"\r\n\r\nTake the _Red-Shafted Flicker_ vs. the codling moth. Mr. A.P. Martin of\r\nPetaluma, Cal., states that during the early spring months (of 1890)\r\nthey were seen by hundreds in his orchard, industriously examining the\r\ntrunks and larger limbs of the fruit trees; and he also found great\r\nnumbers of them around sheds where he stored his winter apples and\r\npears. As the result of several hours' search, Mr. Martin found only one\r\nworm, and this one escaped only by accident, for several of the birds\r\nhad been within a quarter of an inch of it. \"So eager are woodpeckers in\r\nsearch, of codling moths that they have often been known to riddle the\r\nshingle traps and paper bands which are placed to attract the larvae\r\nabout to spin cocoons.\"\r\n\r\nBehold the array of birds that devour the larvae of the codling moth to\r\nan important extent.\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nBIRDS THAT DEVOUR THE CODLING MOTH\r\n\r\nDowny Woodpecker (_Dryobates pubescens_).\r\nHairy Woodpecker (_Dryobates villosus_).\r\nTexan Woodpecker (_Dryobates scalaris bairdi_).\r\nRed-Headed Woodpecker (_Melanerpes erythrocephalus_).\r\nRed-Shafted Flicker (_Colaptes cafer collaris_).\r\nPileated Woodpecker (_Phloeotomus pileatus_).\r\nKingbird (_Tyrranus tyrranus_).\r\nWestern Yellow-Bellied Flycatcher (_Empidonax difficilis_).\r\nBlue Jay (_Cyanocitta cristata_).\r\nCalifornia Jay (_Aphelocoma californica_).\r\nMagpie (_Pica pica hudsonia_).\r\nCrow Blackbird (_Quiscalus quiscula_).\r\nBrewer Blackbird (_Euphagus cyanocephalus_).\r\nBullock Oriole (_Icterus bullocki_).\r\nEnglish Sparrow (_Passer domesticus_).\r\nChipping Sparrow (_Spizella passerina_).\r\nCalifornia Towhee (_Pipilo crissalis_).\r\nCardinal (_Cardinalis cardinalis_).\r\nBlack Headed Grosbeak (_Zamelodia melanocephala_).\r\nLazuli Bunting (_Passerina cyanea_).\r\nBarn Swallow (_Hirundo erythrogastra_).\r\nWestern Warbling Vireo (_Vireosylva gilva swainsoni_).\r\nSummer, or Yellow Warbler (_Dendroica aestiva_).\r\nLutescent Warbler (_Vermivora celata lutescens_).\r\nBrown Creeper (_Certhia familiaris americana_).\r\nWhite-Breasted Nuthatch (_Sitta carolinensis_).\r\nBlack-Capped Chickadee (_Penthestes atricapillus_).\r\nPlain Titmouse (_Baeolophus inornatus_).\r\nCarolina Chickadee (_Penthestes carolinensis_).\r\nMountain Chickadee (_Penthestes gambeli_).\r\nCalifornia Bush Tit (_Psaltriparus minimus californicus_).\r\nRuby-Crowned Kinglet (_Regulus calendula_).\r\nRobin (_Planesticus migratorius_).\r\nBluebird (_Sialia sialis_).\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nIn all, says Mr. W.L. McAtee, thirty-six species of birds of thirteen\r\nfamilies help man in his irrepressible conflict against his deadly\r\nenemy, the codling moth. \"In some places they destroy from sixty-six to\r\neighty-five per cent of the hibernating larvae.\"\r\n\r\nNow, are the farmers of this country content to let the Italians of the\r\nNorth, and the negroes of the South, shoot those birds for food, and\r\ndevour them? What is the great American farmer going to _do_ about this\r\nmatter? What he should do is to write and urge his members of Congress\r\nto work for and vote for the federal migratory bird bill.\r\n\r\nTHE COTTON BOLL WEEVIL.--Let us take one other concrete case. The cotton\r\nboll weevil invaded the United States from Mexico in 1894. Ten years\r\nlater it was costing the cotton planters an annual loss estimated at\r\nfifteen million dollars per year. Later on that loss was estimated at\r\ntwenty million dollars. The cotton boll weevil strikes at the heart of\r\nthe industry by destroying the boll of the cotton plant. While the total\r\nloss never can be definitely ascertained, we know that it has amounted\r\nto many millions of dollars. The figure given above has been widely\r\nquoted, and so far as I am aware, never disputed.\r\n\r\nFortunately we have at hand a government publication on this subject\r\nwhich gives some pertinent facts regarding the bird enemies of the\r\ncotton boll weevil. It is Circular No. 57 of the Biological Survey,\r\nDepartment of Agriculture. Any one can obtain it by addressing that\r\nDepartment. I quote the most important portions of this valuable\r\ndocument:\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nBIRDS USEFUL IN THE WAR AGAINST THE COTTON BOLL WEEVIL.\r\n\r\nBy H.W. Henshaw, Chief of the Biological Survey.\r\n\r\nThe main purpose of this circular is to direct the attention of cotton\r\ngrowers and others in the cotton growing states to the importance of\r\nbirds in the boll weevil war, to emphasize the need of protection for\r\nthem, and to suggest means to increase the numbers and extend the range\r\nof certain of the more important kinds.\r\n\r\nInvestigations by the Biological Survey show that thirty-eight species\r\nof birds eat boll weevils. While some eat them only sparingly others eat\r\nthem freely, and no fewer than forty-seven adult weevils have been found\r\nin the stomach of a single cliff swallow. Of the birds known at the\r\npresent time to feed on the weevil, among the most important are the\r\norioles, nighthawks, and, foremost of all, the swallows (including the\r\npurple martin).\r\n\r\nORIOLES.--Six kinds of orioles live in Texas, though but two inhabit the\r\nsouthern states generally. Orioles are among the few birds that evince a\r\ndecided preference for weevils, and as they persistently hunt for the\r\ninsects on the bolls, they fill a place occupied by no other birds. They\r\nare protected by law in nearly every state in the Union, but their\r\nbright plumage renders them among the most salable of birds for\r\nmillinery purposes, and despite protective laws, considerable numbers\r\nare still killed for the hat trade. It is hardly necessary to point out\r\nthat their importance as insect eaters everywhere demands their\r\nprotection, but more especially in the cotton belt.\r\n\r\nNIGHTHAWK.--The nighthawk, or bull-bat, also renders important service\r\nin the destruction of weevils, and catches them on the wing in\r\nconsiderable numbers, especially during its migration. Unfortunately,\r\n_the nighthawk is eaten for food in some sections of the South, and\r\nconsiderable numbers are shot for this purpose_. The bird's value for\r\nfood, however, is infinitesimal as compared with the service it renders\r\nthe cotton grower and other agriculturists, and every effort should be\r\nmade to spread broadcast a knowledge of its usefulness as a weevil\r\ndestroyer, with a view to its complete protection.\r\n\r\nSWALLOWS.--Of all the birds now known to destroy weevils, swallows are\r\nthe most important. Six species occur in Texas and the southern states.\r\nThe martin, the barn swallow, the bank swallow, the roughwing, and the\r\ncliff swallow breed locally in Texas, and all of them, except the cliff\r\nswallow, breed in the other cotton states. The white-bellied, or tree\r\nswallow, nests only in the North, and by far the greater number of cliff\r\nswallows nest in the North and West.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BALTIMORE ORIOLE\r\nThe Deadly Enemy of the Cotton-Boll Weevil\r\nFrom the \"American Natural History\"]\r\n\r\nAs showing how a colony of martins thrives when provided with sufficient\r\nroom to multiply, an experiment by Mr. J. Warren Jacobs, of Waynesburg,\r\nPa., may be cited. The first year five pairs were induced to occupy the\r\nsingle box provided, and raised eleven young. The fourth year three\r\nlarge boxes, divided into ninety-nine rooms, contained fifty-three\r\npairs, and they raised about 175 young. The colony was thus nearly three\r\nhundred strong at the close of the fourth season. The effect of this\r\nnumber of hungry martins on the insects infesting the neighborhood may\r\nbe imagined.\r\n\r\nFrom the standpoint of the farmer and the cotton grower, swallows are\r\namong the most useful birds. Especially designed by nature to capture\r\ninsects in midair, their powers of flight and endurance are unexcelled,\r\nand in their own field they have no competitors. Their peculiar value to\r\nthe cotton grower consists in the fact that, like the nighthawk, they\r\ncapture boll weevils when flying over the fields, which no other birds\r\ndo. Flycatchers snap up the weevils near trees and shrubbery. Wrens hunt\r\nthem out when concealed under bark or rubbish. Blackbirds catch them on\r\nthe ground, as do the killdeer, titlark, meadow lark, and others; while\r\norioles hunt for them on the bolls. But it is the peculiar function of\r\nswallows to catch the weevils as they are making long flights, leaving\r\nthe cotton fields in search of hiding places in which to winter or\r\nentering them to continue their work of devastation.\r\n\r\nMeans have been taken to inform residents of the northern states of the\r\nvalue of the swallow tribe to agriculturists generally, and particularly\r\nto cotton planters, in the belief that the number of swallows breeding\r\nin the North can be substantially increased. The cooperation of the\r\nnorthern states is important, since birds bred in the North migrate\r\ndirectly through the southern states in the fall on their way to the\r\ndistant tropics, and also in the spring on their return.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE NIGHTHAWK\r\nA Goatsucker, not a Song-bird; but it Feeds Exclusively Upon Insects]\r\n\r\nImportant as it is to increase the number of northern breeding swallows,\r\nit is still more important to increase the number nesting in the South\r\nand to induce the birds there to extend their range over as much of the\r\ncotton area as possible. Nesting birds spend much more time in the South\r\nthan migrants, and during the weeks when the old birds are feeding young\r\nthey are almost incessantly engaged in the pursuit of insects.\r\n\r\nIt is not, of course, claimed that birds alone can stay the ravages of\r\nthe cotton boll weevil in Texas, but they materially aid in checking the\r\nadvance of the pest into the other cotton states. Important auxiliaries,\r\nin destroying these insects, birds aid in reducing their numbers within\r\nsafe limits, and once within safe limits in keeping them there. Hence it\r\nis for the interests of the cotton states that special efforts be made\r\nto protect and care for the weevil-eating species, and to increase their\r\nnumbers in every way possible.--(End of the circular.)\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nCONDENSED NOTES ON THE FOOD HABITS OF CERTAIN NORTH AMERICAN BIRDS.\r\n\r\nMillions of Americans and near-Americans, both old and young, now need\r\nto be shown the actual figures that represent the value of our birds as\r\ndestroyers of the insects, weeds and the small rodents that are swarming\r\nto overrun and devour our fields, orchards and forests. Will our people\r\nnever learn that in fighting pests the birds are worth ten times more to\r\nmen than all the poisons, sprays and traps that ever were invented or\r\nused?\r\n\r\nWe cannot spray our forests; and if the wild birds do not protect, them\r\nfrom insects, _nothing will_! If you will watch a warbler collecting the\r\ninsects out of the top of a seventy-foot forest oak, busy as a bee hour\r\nafter hour, it will convince you that the birds do for the forests that\r\nwhich man with all his resources cannot accomplish. You will then\r\nrealize that to this country every woodpecker, chickadee, titmouse,\r\ncreeper and warbler is easily worth its weight in gold. The killing of\r\nany member of those groups of birds should be punished by a fine of\r\ntwenty-five dollars.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PURPLE MARTIN\r\nA Representative of the Swallow Family. A Great Insect-eater;\r\none of the Most Valuable of all Birds to the Southern Cotton\r\nplanter, and Northern farmer. Shot for \"Food\" in the South.\r\nDriven out of the North by the English Sparrow Pest.]\r\n\r\nTHE BOB-WHITE.--And take the _Bob White Quail_, for example, and the\r\nweeds of the farm. To kill weeds costs money--hard cash that the farmer\r\nearns by toil. Does the farmer put forth strenuous efforts to protect\r\nthe bird of all birds that does most to help him keep down the weeds?\r\nFar from it! All that the _average_ farmer thinks about the quail is of\r\nkilling it, for a few ounces of meat on the table.\r\n\r\nIt is fairly beyond question that of all birds that influence the\r\nfortunes of the farmers and fruit-growers of North America, the common\r\nquail, or bob white, is one of the most valuable. It stays on the farm\r\nall the year round. When insects are most numerous and busy, Bob White\r\ndevotes to them his entire time. He cheerfully fights them, from sixteen\r\nto eighteen hours per day. When the insects are gone, he turns his\r\nattention to the weeds that are striving to seed down the fields for\r\nanother year. Occasionally he gets a few grains of wheat that have been\r\nleft on the ground by the reapers; but he does _no damage_. In\r\nCalifornia, where the valley quail once were very numerous, they\r\nsometimes consumed altogether too much wheat for the good of the\r\nfarmers; but outside of California I believe such occurrences are\r\nunknown.\r\n\r\nLet us glance over the bob white's bill of fare:\r\n\r\n_Weed Seeds_.--One hundred and twenty-nine different weeds have been\r\nfound to contribute to the quail's bill of fare. Crops and stomachs have\r\nbeen found crowded with rag-weed seeds, to the number of one thousand,\r\nwhile others had eaten as many seeds of crab-grass. A bird shot at Pine\r\nBrook, N.J., in October, 1902, had eaten five thousand seeds of green\r\nfox-tail grass, and one killed on Christmas Day at Kinsale, Va., had\r\ntaken about ten thousand seeds of the pig-weed. (Elizabeth A. Reed.) In\r\nBulletin No. 21, Biological Survey, it is calculated that if in Virginia\r\nand North Carolina there are four bob whites to every square mile, and\r\neach bird consumes one ounce of seed per day, the total destruction to\r\nweed seeds from September 1st to April 30th in those states alone will\r\nbe 1,341 tons.\r\n\r\nIn 1910 Mrs. Margaret Morse Nice, of Clark University, Worcester, Mass.,\r\nfinished and contributed to the Journal of Economic Entomology (Vol.\r\nIII., No. 3) a masterful investigation of \"The Food of the Bob-White.\"\r\nIt should be in every library in this land. Mrs. Nice publishes the\r\nentire list of 129 species of weed seeds consumed by the quail,--and it\r\nlooks like a rogue's gallery. Here is an astounding record, which proves\r\nonce more that truth is stranger than fiction:\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nNUMBER OF SEEDS EATEN BY A BOB-WHITE IN ONE DAY\r\n\r\nBarnyard grass    2,500       Milkweed                   770\r\nBeggar ticks      1,400       Peppergrass              2,400\r\nBlack mustard     2,500       Pigweed                 12,000\r\nBurdock             600       Plantain                12,500\r\nCrab grass        2,000       Rabbitsfoot clover      30,000\r\nCurled dock       4,175       Round-headed bush clover 1,800\r\nDodder            1,560       Smartweed                2,250\r\nEvening primrose 10,000       White vervain           18,750\r\nLamb's quarter   15,000       Water smartweed          2,000\r\n\r\nNOTABLY BAD INSECTS EATEN BY THE BOB-WHITE\r\n\r\n(Prof. Judd and Mrs. Nice.)\r\n\r\nColorado potato beetle\r\nCucumber beetle\r\nChinch bug\r\nBean-leaf beetle\r\nWireworm\r\nMay beetle\r\nCorn billbug\r\nImbricated-snout beetle\r\nPlant lice\r\nCabbage butterfly\r\nMosquito\r\nSquash beetle\r\nClover leaf beetle\r\nCotton boll weevil\r\nCotton boll worm\r\nStriped garden caterpillar\r\nCutworms\r\nGrasshoppers\r\nCorn-louse ants\r\nRocky Mountain locust\r\nCodling moth\r\nCanker worm\r\nHessian fly\r\nStable fly\r\n\r\nSUMMARY OF THE QUAIL'S INSECT FOOD\r\n\r\nOrthoptera--Grasshoppers and locusts                13 species.\r\nHemiptera--Bugs                                     24    \"\r\nHomoptera--Leaf hoppers and plant lice               6    \"\r\nLepidoptera--Moths, caterpillars, cut-worms, etc    19    \"\r\nDiptera--Flies                                       8    \"\r\nColeoptera--Beetles                                 61    \"\r\nHymenoptera--Ants, wasps, slugs                      8    \"\r\nOther insects                                        6    \"\r\n                                                   ---\r\n                                             Total 145    \"\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BOB-WHITE\r\nFor the Smaller Pests of the Farm, This Bird is the Most\r\nMarvelous Engine of Destruction Ever put Together of Flesh and Blood.]\r\n\r\n_A few sample meals of insects_.--The following are records of single\r\nindividual meals of the bob white:\r\n\r\nOf grasshoppers, 84; chinch bugs, 100; squash bugs, 12; army worm, 12;\r\ncut-worm, 12; mosquitoes, 568 in three hours; cotton boll weevil, 47;\r\nflies, 1,350; rose slugs, 1,286. Miscellaneous insects consumed by a\r\nlaying hen quail, 1,532, of which 1,000 were grasshoppers; total weigh\r\nof the lot, 24.6 grams.\r\n\r\n\"F.M. Howard, of Beeville, Texas, wrote to the U.S. Bureau of\r\nEntomology, that the bob whites shot in his vicinity had their crops\r\nfilled with the weevils. Another farmer reported his cotton fields full\r\nof quail, and an entire absence of weevils.\" Texas and Georgia papers\r\n(please copy.)\r\n\r\nAnd yet, because of its few pitiful ounces of flesh, two million gunners\r\nand ten thousand lawmakers think of the quail _only as a bird that can\r\nbe shot and eaten!_ Throughout a great portion of its former range,\r\nincluding New York and New Jersey, the species is surely and certainly\r\non the verge of _total extinction_. And yet sportsmen gravely discuss\r\nthe \"bag limit,\" and \"enforcement of the bag-limit law\" as a means of\r\nbringing back this almost vanished species! Such folly in grown men is\r\nvery trying.\r\n\r\n_To my friend, the Epicure_:--The next time you regale a good appetite\r\nwith blue points, terrapin stew, filet of sole and saddle of mutton,\r\ntouched up here and there with the high lights of rare old sherry, rich\r\nclaret and dry monopole, pause as the dead quail is laid before you, on\r\na funeral pyre of toast, and consider this: \"Here lies the charred\r\nremains of the Farmer's Ally and Friend, poor Bob White. In life he\r\ndevoured 145 different kinds of bad insects, and the seeds of 129\r\nanathema weeds. For the smaller pests of the farm, he was the most\r\nmarvelous engine of destruction that God ever put together of flesh and\r\nblood. He was good, beautiful and true; and his small life was\r\nblameless. And here he lies, dead; snatched away from his field of\r\nlabor, and destroyed, in order that I may be tempted to dine three\r\nminutes longer, after I have already eaten to satiety.\"\r\n\r\nThen go on, and finish Bob White.\r\n\r\nTHE CASE OF THE ROBIN.--For a long time this bird has been slaughtered\r\nin the South for food, regardless of the agricultural interests of the\r\nNorth. No Southern gentleman ever shoots robins, or song birds of any\r\nkind, but the negroes and poor whites do it. The worst case of recent\r\noccurrence was the slaughter in the town of Pittsboro, North Carolina.\r\n\r\nIt was in January, 1912. The Mayor of the town, Hon. Bennet Nooe, was\r\naway from home; and during a heavy fall of snow \"the robins came into\r\nthe town in great numbers to feed upon the berries of the cedar trees.\r\nIn order that the birds might be killed without restriction, the Board\r\nof Aldermen suspended the ordinance against the firing of guns in the\r\ntown, and permitted the inhabitants to kill the robins.\"\r\n\r\nA disgraceful carnival of slaughter immediately followed in which \"about\r\nall the male population\" participated. Regarding this, Mayor Nooe later\r\non wrote to the editor of Bird Lore as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Hearing of this, on my return, I went to the Aldermen, _all of whom\r\nwere guilty_, and told them that they and all others who were guilty\r\nwould have to be fined. Three out of the five submitted and paid up, but\r\nthey insisted that the ordinance be changed to read exactly as it is\r\nwritten here, with the exception that _all could shoot_ robins in the\r\ntown until the first of March; whereupon I resigned, as was\r\nstated.\"--(_Bird Lore,_ XIV, 2. p. 140.)\r\n\r\nThe Mayor was quite right. The robin butchers of Pittsboro were not\r\nworthy to be governed by him.\r\n\r\nTHE MEADOW LARK is one of the most valuable birds that frequent farming\r\nregions. Throughout the year insects make up 73 per cent of its food,\r\nweed-seeds 12 per cent, and grain only 5 per cent. During the insect\r\nseason, insects constitute 90 per cent of its food.\r\n\r\nTHE BALTIMORE ORIOLE is as valuable to man as it is beautiful. Its nest\r\nis the most wonderful example of bird architecture in our land. In May\r\ninsects constitute 90 per cent of this bird's food. For the entire year,\r\ninsects and other animal food make 83.4 per cent and vegetable matter\r\n16.6 per cent.\r\n\r\nTHE CROW BLACKBIRD feeds as follows, throughout the whole year: insects,\r\n26.9 per cent; other animal food 3.4; corn 37.2; oats, 2.9; wheat, 4.8;\r\nother grain, 1.6; fruits, 5; weed seeds and mast 18.2! This report was\r\nbased on the examination (by the Biological Survey) of 2,346 stomachs,\r\nand \"the charge that the blackbird is an habitual robber of birds' nests\r\nwas disproved by the examinations.\" (F.E.L. Beal.)\r\n\r\nFLYCATCHERS.--The high-water mark in insect-destruction by our birds is\r\nreached by the flycatchers,--dull-colored, modest-mannered little\r\ncreatures that do their work so quietly you hardly notice them. All you\r\nsee in your tree-tops is a two-foot flit or glide, now here and now\r\nthere, as the leaves and high branches are combed of their insect life.\r\n\r\nBulletin No. 44 of the Department of Agriculture gives the residuum of\r\nan exhausting examination of 3,398 warbler stomachs, from seventeen\r\nspecies of birds, and the result is: 94.99 per cent of insect\r\nfood,--mostly bad insects, too,--and 5.01 per cent vegetable food. What\r\nmore can any forester ask of a bird?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ROSE-BREASTED GROSBEAK\r\n\"The Potato-bug Bird,\" Greatest Enemy of the Potato Beetles\r\nFrom the \"American Natural History\"]\r\n\r\nTHE SPARROWS.--All our sparrows are great consumers of weed seeds.\r\nProfessor Beal has calculated the total quantity consumed in Iowa in one\r\nyear,--in the days when sparrows were normally numerous,--at 1,750,000\r\npounds.\r\n\r\nTHE AMERICAN GOLDFINCH as a weed destroyer has few equals. It makes a\r\nspecialty of the seeds of the members of the Order Compositae, and is\r\nespecially fond of the seeds of ragweed, thistles, wild lettuce and wild\r\nsunflower. But, small and beautiful as this bird is, there are hundreds\r\nof thousands of grown men in America who would shoot it and eat it if\r\nthey dared!\r\n\r\nTHE HAWKS AND OWLS.--Let no other state repeat the error that once was\r\nmade in Pennsylvania when that state enacted in 1885, her now famous\r\nhawk-and-owl bounty law. In order to accomplish the wholesale\r\ndestruction of her birds of prey, a law was passed providing for the\r\npayment of a bounty of fifty cents each for the scalps of hawks and\r\nowls. Immediately the slaughter began. In two years 180,000 scalps were\r\nbrought in, and $90,000 were paid out for them. It was estimated that\r\nthe saving to the farmers in poultry amounted to one dollar for each\r\n$1,205 paid out in bounties.\r\n\r\nThe awakening came even more swiftly than the ornithologists expected.\r\nBy the end of two years from the passage of \"the hawk law,\" the farmers\r\nfound their fields and orchards thoroughly overrun by destructive rats,\r\nmice and insects, and they appealed to the legislature for the quick\r\nrepeal of the law. With all possible haste this was brought about; but\r\nit was estimated by competent judges that in damages to their crops the\r\nhawk law cost the people of Pennsylvania nothing less than two million\r\ndollars.\r\n\r\nMoral: Don't make any laws providing for the destruction of hawks and\r\nowls until you have exact knowledge, and know in advance what the\r\nresults will be.\r\n\r\nIn the space at my disposal for this subject, it is impossible to treat\r\nour species of hawks and owls separately. The reader can find in the\r\n\"American Natural History\" fifteen pages of text, numerous illustrations\r\nand many figures elucidating this subject. Unfortunately Dr. Fisher's\r\nadmirable work on \"The Hawks and Owls\" has long been out of print, and\r\nunobtainable. There are, however, a few observations that must be\r\nrecorded here.\r\n\r\nEach bird of prey is a balanced equation. Each one, I think without a\r\nsingle exception, does _some_ damage, chiefly in the destruction of\r\nvaluable wild birds. The value of the poultry destroyed by hawks and\r\nowls is very small in comparison with their killing of wild prey. _Many\r\nof the species do not touch domestic poultry_! At the same time, when a\r\nhawk of any kind, or an owl, sets to work deliberately and persistently\r\nto clean out a farmer's poultry yard, and is actually doing it, that\r\nfarmer is justified in killing that bird. But, the _occasional_ loss of\r\na broiler is not to be regarded as justification for a war of\r\nextermination on _all_ the hawks that fly! Individual wild-animal\r\nnuisances can occasionally become so exasperating as to justify the use\r\nof the gun,--when scarecrows fail; but in all such circumstances the\r\ngreatest judgment, and much forbearance also, is desirable and\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nThe value of hawks and owls rests upon their perpetual warfare on the\r\nmillions of destructive rats, mice, moles, shrews, weasels, rabbits and\r\nEnglish sparrows that constantly prey upon what the farmer produces. On\r\nthis point a few illustrations must be given. One of the most famous\r\ncomes via Dr. Fisher, from one of the towers of the Smithsonian\r\nbuildings, and relates to\r\n\r\nTHE BARN OWL, (_Strix flammea_).--Two hundred pellets consisting of\r\nbones, hair and feathers from one nesting pair of these birds were\r\ncollected, and found to contain 454 skulls, of which 225 were of meadow\r\nmice, 179 of house mice, 2 of pine mice, 20 were of rats, 6 of jumping\r\nmice, 20 were from shrews, 1 was of a mole and 1 a vesper sparrow. _One_\r\nbird, and 453 noxious mammals! Compare this with the record of any cat\r\non earth. Anything that the barn owl wants from me, or from any farmer,\r\nshould at once be offered to it, on a silver tray. This bird is often\r\ncalled the Monkey-Faced Owl, and it should be called the Farmer's-Friend\r\nOwl.\r\n\r\nTHE LONG-EARED OWL, (_Asio wilsonianus_) has practically the same kind\r\nof a record as the barn owl,--scores of mice, rats and shrews\r\ndestroyed, and only an occasional small bird. Its nearest relative, the\r\n_Short-eared Owl (A. accipitrinus_) may be described in the same words.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BARN OWL\r\nWonderfully Destructive of Rats and Mice, and\r\nAlmost Never Touches Birds]\r\n\r\nThe GREAT HORNED OWL fills us with conflicting passions. For the long\r\nlist of dead rats and mice, pocket gophers, skunks, and weasels to his\r\ncredit, we think well of him, and wish his prosperity. For the\r\nsong-birds, ruffed grouse, quail, other game birds, domestic poultry,\r\nsquirrels, chipmunks and hares that he kills, we hate him, and would\r\ncheerfully wring his neck, wearing gauntlets. He does an unusual amount\r\nof good, and a terrible amount of harm. It is impossible to strike a\r\nbalance for him, and determine with mathematical accuracy whether he\r\nshould be shot or permitted to live. At all events, whenever _Bubo_\r\ncomes up for trial, we must give the feathered devil his due.\r\n\r\nThe names \"CHICKEN HAWK or HEN HAWK\" as applied usually refer to the\r\nRED-SHOULDERED or RED-TAILED species. Neither of these is really very\r\ndestructive to poultry, but both are very destructive to mice, rats and\r\nother pestiferous creatures. Both are large, showy birds, not so very\r\nswift in flight, and rather easy to approach. Neither of them should be\r\ndestroyed,--not even though they do, once in a great while, take a\r\nchicken or wild bird. They pay for them, four times over, by\r\nrat-killing. Mr. J. Alden Loring states that he once knew a pair of\r\nred-shouldered hawks to nest within fifty rods of a poultry farm on\r\nwhich there were 800 young chickens and 400 ducks, not one of which was\r\ntaken. (See the American Natural History, pages 229-30.)\r\n\r\nHAWKS THAT SHOULD BE DESTROYED.--There are two small, fierce, daring,\r\nswift-winged hawks both of which are so very destructive that they\r\ndeserve to be shot whenever possible. They are COOPER'S HAWK _(Accipiter\r\ncooperi_) and the SHARP-SHINNED HAWK _(A. velox_). They are closely\r\nrelated, and look much alike, but the former has a rounded tail and the\r\nlatter a square one. In killing them, _please do not kill any other hawk\r\nby mistake_; and if you do not positively recognize the bird, don't\r\nshoot.\r\n\r\nTHE GOSHAWK is a bad one, and so is the PEREGRINE FALCON, or DUCK HAWK.\r\nBoth deserve death, but they are so rare that we need not take them into\r\naccount.\r\n\r\nSome of the hawks and owls are very destructive to song-birds, and\r\nmembers of the grouse family. In 159 stomachs of sharp-shinned hawks, 99\r\ncontained song-birds and woodpeckers. In 133 stomachs of Cooper's hawks,\r\n34 contained poultry or game birds, and 52 contained other birds. The\r\ngame birds included 8 quail, 1 ruffed grouse and 5 pigeons.\r\n\r\nTHE WOODPECKERS.[I]--These birds are the natural guardians of the trees.\r\nIf we had enough of them, our forests would be fairly safe from insect\r\npests. Of the six or seven North American species that are of the most\r\nimportance to our forests, the DOWNY WOODPECKER, (_Dryobates pubescens_)\r\nis accorded first rank. It is one of the smallest species. The contents\r\nof 140 stomachs consisted of 74 per cent insects, 25 per cent vegetable\r\nmatter and 1 per cent sand. The insects were ants, beetles, bugs, flies,\r\ncaterpillars, grasshoppers and a few spiders.\r\n\r\n[Footnote I: The reader is advised to consult Prof. F.E.L. Beale's\r\nadmirable report on \"The Food of Woodpeckers,\" Bulletin No. 7, U.S.\r\nDepartment of Agriculture.]\r\n\r\nTHE HAIRY WOODPECKER, (_Dryobates villosus_), a very close relation of\r\nthe preceding species, is also small, and his food supply is as follows:\r\ninsects, 68 per cent, vegetable matter 31, mineral 1.\r\n\r\nTHE GOLDEN-WINGED WOODPECKER, (_Colaptes auratus_), is the largest and\r\nhandsomest of all the woodpeckers that we really see in evidence. The\r\nPileated is one of the largest, but we never see it. This bird makes a\r\nspecialty of ants, of which it devours immense numbers. Its food is 56\r\nper cent animal matter (three-fourths of which is ants), 39 per cent is\r\nvegetable matter, and 5 per cent mineral matter.\r\n\r\nTHE RED-HEADED WOODPECKER is a serious fruit-eater, and many complaints\r\nhave been lodged against him. Exactly one-half his food supply consists\r\nof vegetable matter, chiefly wild berries, acorns, beechnuts, and the\r\nseeds of wild shrubs and weeds. We may infer that about one-tenth of his\r\nfood, in summer and fall, consists of cultivated fruit and berries. His\r\nproportion of cultivated foods is entirely too small to justify any one\r\nin destroying this species.\r\n\r\nIn view of the prevalence of insect pests in the state of New York, I\r\nhave spent hours in trying to devise a practical plan for making\r\nwoodpeckers about ten times more numerous than they now are.\r\nContributions to this problem will be thankfully received. Yes; we _do_\r\nput out pork fat and suet in winter, quantities of it; but I grieve to\r\nsay that to-day in the Zoological Park there is not more than one\r\nwoodpecker for every ten that were there twelve years ago. Where have\r\nthey gone? Only one answer is possible. They have been shot and eaten,\r\nby the guerrillas of destruction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GOLDEN-WINGED WOODPECKER\r\nA Bird of Great Value to Orchards and Forests, now\r\nRapidly Disappearing, Undoubtedly Through Slaughter as \"Food\"]\r\n\r\nSurely no man of intelligence needs to be told to protect woodpeckers to\r\nthe utmost, and to _feed them in winter_. Nail up fat pork, or large\r\nchunks of suet, on the south sides of conspicuous trees, and encourage\r\nthe woodpeckers, nuthatches, chickadees and titmice to remain in your\r\nwoods through the long and dreary winter.\r\n\r\nTHE ENGLISH SPARROW is a nuisance and a pest, because it drives away\r\nfrom the house and the orchard the house wren, bluebird, phoebe, purple\r\nmartin and swallow, any one of which is more valuable to man than a\r\nthousand English sparrows. I never yet have seen one of the pest\r\nsparrows catch an insect, but Chief Forester Merkel says that he has\r\nseen one catching and eating small moths.\r\n\r\nThere is one place in the country where English sparrows have not yet\r\ncome; and whenever they do appear there, they will meet a hostile\r\nreception. I shall kill every one that comes,--for the sake of retaining\r\nthe wrens, catbirds, phoebes and thrushes that now literally make home\r\nhappy for my family. A good way to discourage sparrows is to shoot them\r\nen masse when they are feeding on road refuse, such as the\r\nwhite-throated, white-crowned and other sparrows never touch. Persistent\r\ndestruction of their nests will check the nuisance.\r\n\r\nTHE SHORE BIRDS.--Who is there who thinks of the shore-birds as being\r\ndirectly beneficial to man by reason of their food habits? I warrant not\r\nmore than one man in every ten thousand! We think of them only as\r\npossible \"food.\" The amount of actual cash value benefit that the\r\nshore-birds confer upon man through the destruction of bad things is, in\r\ncomparison with the number of birds, enormous.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Agriculture never publishes and circulates anything\r\nthat has already been published, no matter how valuable to the public at\r\nlarge. Our rules are different. Because I know that many of the people\r\nof our country need the information, I am going to reprint here, as an\r\nobject lesson and a warning, the whole of the Biological Survey's\r\nvaluable and timely circular No. 79, issued April 11, 1911, and written\r\nby Prof. W.L. McAtee. It should open the eyes of the American people to\r\ntwo things: the economic value of these birds, and the fact that they\r\nare everywhere far on the road toward extermination!\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nOUR VANISHING SHOREBIRDS\r\n\r\nBy Prof. W.L. McAtee\r\n\r\nThe term shorebird is applied to a group of long-legged, slender-billed,\r\nand usually plainly colored birds belonging to the order Limicolae. More\r\nthan sixty species of them occur in North America. True to their name\r\nthey frequent the shores of all bodies of water, large and small, but\r\nmany of them are equally at home on plains and prairies.\r\n\r\nThroughout the eastern United States shorebirds are fast vanishing.\r\nWhile formerly numerous species swarmed along the Atlantic coast and in\r\nthe prairie regions, many of them have been so reduced that\r\nextermination seems imminent. The black-bellied plover or beetlehead,\r\nwhich occurred along the Atlantic seaboard in great numbers years ago,\r\nis now seen only as a straggler. The golden plover, once exceedingly\r\nabundant east of the Great Plains, is now rare. Vast hordes of\r\nlong-billed dowitchers formerly wintered in Louisiana; now they occur\r\nonly in infrequent flocks of a half dozen or less. The Eskimo curlew\r\nwithin the last decade has probably been exterminated and the other\r\ncurlews greatly reduced. In fact, all the larger species of shorebirds\r\nhave suffered severely.\r\n\r\nSo adverse to shorebirds are present conditions that the wonder is that\r\nany escape. In both fall and spring they are shot along the whole route\r\nof their migration north and south. Their habit of decoying readily and\r\npersistently, coming back in flocks to the decoys again and again, in\r\nspite of murderous volleys, greatly lessens their chances of escape.\r\n\r\nThe breeding grounds of some of the species in the United States and\r\nCanada have become greatly restricted by the extension of agriculture,\r\nand their winter ranges in South America have probably been restricted\r\nin the same way.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, shorebirds lay fewer eggs than any of the other species\r\ngenerally termed game birds. They deposit only three or four eggs, and\r\nhatch only one brood yearly. Nor are they in any wise immune from the\r\ngreat mortality known to prevail among the smaller birds. Their eggs and\r\nyoung are constantly preyed upon during the breeding season by crows,\r\ngulls, and jaegers, and the far northern country to which so many of\r\nthem resort to nest is subject to sudden cold storms, which kill many of\r\nthe young. In the more temperate climate of the United States small\r\nbirds, in general, do not bring up more than one young bird for every\r\ntwo eggs laid. Sometimes the proportion of loss is much greater, actual\r\ncount revealing a destruction of 70 to 80 per cent of nests and eggs.\r\nShorebirds, with sets of three or four eggs, probably do not on the\r\naverage rear more than two young for each breeding pair.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising, therefore, that birds of this family, with their\r\nlimited powers of reproduction, melt away under the relentless warfare\r\nwaged upon them. Until recent years shorebirds have had almost no\r\nprotection. Thus, the species most in need of stringent protection have\r\nreally had the least. No useful birds which lay only three or four eggs\r\nshould be retained on the list of game birds. The shorebirds should be\r\nrelieved from persecution, and if we desire to save from extermination a\r\nmajority of the species, action must be prompt.\r\n\r\nThe protection of shorebirds need not be based solely on esthetic or\r\nsentimental grounds, for few groups of birds more thoroughly deserve\r\nprotection from an economic standpoint. Shorebirds perform an important\r\nservice by their inroads upon mosquitoes, some of which play so\r\nconspicuous a part in the dissemination of diseases. Thus, nine species\r\nare known to feed upon mosquitoes, and hundreds of the larvae or\r\n\"wigglers\" were found in several stomachs. Fifty-three per cent of the\r\nfood of twenty-eight northern phalaropes from one locality consisted of\r\nmosquito larvae. The insects eaten include the salt-marsh mosquito\r\n(_Aedes sollicitans_), for the suppression of which the State of New\r\nJersey has gone to great expense. The nine species of shorebirds known\r\nto eat mosquitoes are:\r\n\r\nNorthern phalarope (_Lobipes lobatus_).\r\nSemipalmated sandpiper (_Ereunetes pusillus_).\r\nWilson phalarope (_Steganopus tricolor_).\r\nStilt sandpiper (_Micropalama himantopus_).\r\nKilldeer (_Oxyechus vociferus_).\r\nPectoral sandpiper (_Pisobia maculata_).\r\nSemipalmated plover (_Aegialitis semipalmata_).\r\nBaird sandpiper (_Pisobia bairdi_).\r\nLeast sandpiper (_Pisobia minutilla_).\r\n\r\nCattle and other live stock also are seriously molested by mosquitoes as\r\nwell as by another set of pests, the horse-flies. Adults and larvae of\r\nthese flies have been found in the stomachs of the dowitcher, the\r\npectoral sandpiper, the hudsonian godwit, and the killdeer. Two species\r\nof shorebirds, the killdeer and upland plover, still further befriend\r\ncattle by devouring the North American fever tick.\r\n\r\nAmong other fly larvae consumed are those of the crane flies\r\n(leather-jackets) devoured by the following species:\r\n\r\nNorthern phalarope (_Lobipes lobatus_).\r\nPectoral sandpiper (_Pisobia maculata_).\r\nWilson phalarope (_Steganopus tricolor_).\r\nBaird sandpiper (_Pisobia bairdi_).\r\nWoodcock (_Philohela minor_).\r\nUpland plover (_Bartramia longicauda_).\r\nJacksnipe (_Gallinago delicata_).\r\nKilldeer (_Oxyechus vociferus_).\r\n\r\nCrane-fly larvae are frequently seriously destructive locally in grass\r\nand wheat fields. Among their numerous bird enemies, shorebirds rank\r\nhigh.\r\n\r\nAnother group of insects of which the shorebirds are very fond is\r\ngrasshoppers. Severe local infestations of grasshoppers, frequently\r\ninvolving the destruction of many acres of corn, cotton, and other\r\ncrops, are by no means exceptional. Aughey found twenty-three species\r\nof shorebirds feeding on Rocky Mountain locusts in Nebraska, some of\r\nthem consuming large numbers, as shown below.\r\n\r\n 9 killdeer stomachs contained an average of 28 locusts each.\r\n11 semipalmated plover stomachs contained an average of 38 locusts each.\r\n16 mountain plover stomachs contained an average of 45 locusts each.\r\n11 jacksnipe stomachs contained an average of 37 locusts each.\r\n22 upland plover stomachs contained an average of 36 locusts each.\r\n10 long-billed curlew stomachs contained an average of 48 locusts each.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TWO MEMBERS OF THE GROUP OF SHORE-BIRDS\r\nThe Killdeer Plover     The Jacksnipe\r\nThese, with 28 other species, destroy enormous numbers of locusts,\r\ngrasshoppers, crane-fly larvae, mosquito larvae, army-worms, cut-worms,\r\ncotton-worms, boll-weevils, curculios, wire-worms and clover-leaf\r\nweevils. It is insane folly to shoot any birds that do such work! Many\r\nspecies of the shore-birds are rapidly being exterminated.]\r\n\r\nEven under ordinary conditions grasshoppers are a staple food of many\r\nmembers of the shorebird family, and the following species are known to\r\nfeed on them:\r\n\r\nNorthern phalarope (_Lobipes lobatus_).\r\nAvocet (_Recurvirostra americana_).\r\nBlack-necked stilt (_Himantopus mexicanus_).\r\nWoodcock (_Philohela minor_).\r\nJacksnipe (_Gallinago delicata_).\r\nDowitcher (_Macrorhamphus griseus_).\r\nRobin snipe (_Tringa canutus_).\r\nWhite-rumped sandpiper (_Pisobia fuscicollis_).\r\nBaird sandpiper (_Pisobia bairdi_).\r\nLeast sandpiper (_Pisobia minutilla_).\r\nBuff-breasted sandpiper (_Tryngites subruficollis_).\r\nSpotted sandpiper (_Actitis macularia_).\r\nLong-billed curlew (_Numenius americanus_).\r\nBlack-bellied plover (_Squatarola squatarola_).\r\nGolden plover (_Charadrius dominicus_).\r\nKilldeer (_Oxyechus vociferus_).\r\nSemipalmated plover (_Aegialitis semipalmata_).\r\nMarbled godwit _(Limosa fedoa)_.\r\nRinged plover _(Aegialitis hiaticula)_.\r\nYellowlegs _(Totanus flavipes)_.\r\nMountain plover _(Podasocys montanus)_.\r\nSolitary sandpiper _(Helodromas solitarius)_.\r\nTurnstone _(Arenaria interpres)_.\r\nUpland plover _(Bartramia longicauda)_.\r\n\r\nShorebirds are fond of other insect pests of forage and grain crops,\r\nincluding the army worm, which is known to be eaten by the killdeer and\r\nspotted sandpiper; also cutworms, among whose enemies are the avocet,\r\nwoodcock, pectoral and Baird sandpipers, upland plover, and killdeer.\r\nTwo caterpillar enemies of cotton, the cotton worm and the cotton\r\ncutworm, are eaten by the upland plover and killdeer. The latter bird\r\nfeeds also on caterpillars of the genus _Phlegethontius_, which\r\nincludes, the tobacco and tomato worms.\r\n\r\nThe principal farm crops have many destructive beetle enemies also, and\r\nsome of these are eagerly eaten by shorebirds. The boll weevil and\r\nclover-leaf weevil are eaten by the upland plover and killdeer, the rice\r\nweevil by the killdeer, the cowpea weevil by the upland plover, and the\r\nclover-root curculio by the following species of shorebirds:\r\n\r\nNorthern phalarope _(Lobipes lobatus)_.\r\nWhite-rumped sandpiper _(Pisobia fuscicollis)_.\r\nPectoral sandpiper _(Pisobia maculata_).\r\nUpland plover _(Bartramia longicauda)_.\r\nBaird sandpiper _(Pisobia bairdi)_.\r\nKilldeer _(Oxyechus vociferus)_.\r\n\r\nThe last two eat also other weevils which attack cotton, grapes and\r\nsugar beets. Bill-bugs, which often do considerable damage to corn, seem\r\nto be favorite food of some of the shorebirds. They are eaten by the\r\nWilson phalarope, avocet, black-necked stilt, pectoral sandpiper,\r\nkilldeer, and upland plover. They are an important element of the latter\r\nbird's diet, and no fewer than eight species of them have been found in\r\nits food.\r\n\r\nWireworms and their adult forms, click beetles, are devoured by the\r\nnorthern phalarope, woodcock, jacksnipe, pectoral sandpiper, killdeer,\r\nand upland plover. The last three feed also on the southern corn\r\nleaf-beetle and the last two upon the grapevine colaspis. Other\r\nshorebirds that eat leaf-beetles are the Wilson phalarope and dowitcher.\r\n\r\nCrayfishes, which are a pest in rice and corn fields in the South and\r\nwhich injure levees, are favorite food of the black-necked stilt, and\r\nseveral other shorebirds feed upon them, notably the jacksnipe, robin\r\nsnipe, spotted sandpiper, upland plover, and killdeer.\r\n\r\nThus it is evident that shorebirds render important aid by devouring the\r\nenemies of farm crops and in other ways, and their services are\r\nappreciated by those who have observed the birds in the field. Thus W.A.\r\nClark, of Corpus Christi, Tex., reports that upland plovers are\r\nindustrious in following the plow and in eating the grubs that destroy\r\ngarden stuff, corn, and cotton crops. H.W. Tinkham, of Fall River,\r\nMass., says of the spotted sandpiper: \"Three pairs nested in a young\r\norchard behind my house and adjacent to my garden. I did not see them\r\nonce go to the shore for food (shore about 1,500 feet away), but I did\r\nsee them many times make faithful search of my garden for cutworms,\r\nspotted squash bugs, and green flies. Cutworms and cabbage worms were\r\ntheir special prey. After the young could fly, they still kept at work\r\nin my garden, and showed no inclination to go to the shore until about\r\nAugust 15th. They and a flock of quails just over the wall helped me\r\nwonderfully.\"\r\n\r\nIn the uncultivated parts of their range also, shorebirds search out and\r\ndestroy many creatures that are detrimental to man's interest. Several\r\nspecies prey upon the predaceous diving beetles _(Dytiscidae),_ which\r\nare a nuisance in fish hatcheries and which destroy many insects, the\r\nnatural food of fishes. The birds now known to take these beetles are:\r\n\r\nNorthern phalarope _(Lobipes lobatus)_.\r\nDowitcher _(Macrorhamphus griseus)_.\r\nWilson phalarope _(Steganopus tricolor)_.\r\nRobin snipe _(Tringa canutus)_.\r\nAvocet _(Recurvirostra americana)_.\r\nPectoral sandpiper _(Pisobia maculata)_.\r\nBlack-necked stilt _(Himantopus mexicanus_).\r\nRed-backed sandpiper _(Pelidna alpina sakhalina)_.\r\nJacksnipe _(Gallinago delicata)_.\r\nKill deer _(Oxyechus vociferus)_.\r\n\r\nLarge numbers of marine worms of the genus _Nereis_, which prey upon\r\noysters, are eaten by shorebirds. These worms are common on both the\r\nAtlantic and Gulf coasts and are eaten by shorebirds wherever they\r\noccur. It is not uncommon to find that from 100 to 250 of them have been\r\neaten at one meal. The birds known to feed upon them are:\r\n\r\nNorthern phalarope _(Lobipes lobatus)_.\r\nWhite-rumped sandpiper _(Pisobia fuscicollis)_.\r\nDowitcher _(Macrorhamphus griseus_).\r\nStilt sandpiper _(Micropalama himantopus)_.\r\nRed-backed sandpiper _(Pelidna alpina sakhalina)_.\r\nRobin snipe _(Tringa canutus)_.\r\nPurple sandpiper _(Arquatella maritima_).\r\nKilldeer _(Oxyechus vociferus)_.\r\n\r\nThe economic record of the shorebirds deserves nothing but praise. These\r\nbirds injure no crop, but on the contrary feed upon many of the worst\r\nenemies of agriculture. It is worth recalling that their diet includes\r\nsuch pests as the Rocky Mountain locust and other injurious\r\ngrasshoppers, the army worm, cutworms, cabbage worms, cotton worm,\r\ncotton cutworm, boll weevil, clover leaf weevil, clover root curculio,\r\nrice weevil, corn bill-bugs, wireworms, corn leaf-beetles, cucumber\r\nbeetles, white grubs, and such foes of stock as the Texas fever tick,\r\nhorseflies, and mosquitoes. Their warfare on crayfishes must not be\r\noverlooked, nor must we forget the more personal debt of gratitude we\r\nowe them for preying upon mosquitoes. They are the most important bird\r\nenemies of these pests known to us.\r\n\r\nShorebirds have been hunted until only a remnant of their once vast\r\nnumbers is left. Their limited powers of reproduction, coupled with the\r\nnatural vicissitudes of the breeding period, make their increase slow,\r\nand peculiarly expose them to danger of extermination.\r\n\r\nIn the way of protection a beginning has been made, and a continuous\r\nclose season until 1915 has been established for the following birds:\r\nThe killdeer, in Massachusetts and Louisiana; the upland plover, in\r\nMassachusetts, and Vermont; and the piping plover in Massachusetts. But,\r\nconsidering the needs and value of these birds, this modicum of\r\nprotection is small indeed.\r\n\r\nThe above-named species are not the only ones that should be exempt\r\nfrom persecution, for all the shorebirds of the United States are in\r\ngreat need of better protection. They should be protected, first, to\r\nsave them from the danger of extermination, and, second, because of\r\ntheir economic importance. So great, indeed, is their economic value,\r\nthat their retention on the game list and their destruction by sportsmen\r\nis a serious loss to agriculture.--(End of the circular.)\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nThe following appeared in the _Zoological Society Bulletin_, for\r\nJanuary, 1909, from Richard Walter Tomalin, of Sydney, N.S.W.:\r\n\r\n\"In the subdistricts of Robertson and Kangaloon in the Illawarra\r\ndistrict of New South Wales, what ten years ago was a waving mass of\r\nEnglish cocksfoot and rye grass, which had been put in gradually as the\r\ndense vine scrub was felled and burnt off, is now a barren desert, and\r\nnine families out of every ten which were renting properties have been\r\ncompelled to leave the district and take up other lands. This is through\r\nthe grubs having eaten out the grass by the roots. Ploughing proved to\r\nbe useless, as the grubs ate out the grass just the same. Whilst there\r\nrecently I was informed that it took three years from the time the grubs\r\nwere first seen until to-day, to accomplish this complete devastation;.\r\nin other words, three years ago the grubs began work in the beautiful\r\ncountry of green mountains and running streams.\r\n\r\n\"The birds had all been ruthlessly shot and destroyed in that district,\r\nand I was amazed at the absence of bird life. The two sub-districts I\r\nhave mentioned have an area of about thirty square miles, and form a\r\ntable-land about 1200 feet above sea level.\"\r\n\r\nThe same kind of common sense that teaches men to go in when it rains,\r\nand keep out of fiery furnaces, teaches us that as a business\r\nproposition it is to man's interest to protect the birds. Make them\r\nplentiful and keep them so. When we strike the birds, we hurt ourselves.\r\nThe protection of our insect-eating and seed-eating birds is a cash\r\nproposition,--protect or pay.\r\n\r\nWere I a farmer, no gun ever should be fired on my premises at any bird\r\nsave the English sparrow and the three bad hawks. Any man who would kill\r\nmy friend Bob White I would treat as an enemy. The man who would shoot\r\nand eat any of the song-birds, woodpeckers, or shorebirds that worked\r\nfor me, I would surely molest.\r\n\r\n_Every farmer should post every foot of his lands, cultivated and not\r\ncultivated_. The farmer who does not do so is his own enemy; and he\r\nneeds a guardian.\r\n\r\nAt this stage of wild life extermination, it is impossible to make our\r\nbird-protection laws too strict, or too far-reaching. The remnant of our\r\nbirds should be protected, with clubs and guns if necessary. All our\r\nshore birds should be accorded a ten-year close season. Don't ask the\r\ngunners whether they will _agree_ to it or not. _Of course they will not\r\nagree to it,--never_! But our duty is clear,--to go ahead and _do it_!\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nGAME AND AGRICULTURE; AND DEER AS A FOOD SUPPLY\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a state and county asset, the white-tailed deer contains\r\npossibilities that as yet seem to be ignored by the American people as a\r\nwhole. It is quite time to consider that persistent, prolific and\r\ntoothsome animal.\r\n\r\nThe proposition that large herds of horned game can not becomingly roam\r\nat will over farms and vineyards worth one hundred dollars per acre,\r\naffords little room for argument. Generally speaking, there is but one\r\ncountry in the world that breaks this well-nigh universal rule; and that\r\ncountry is India. On the plains between and adjacent to the Ganges and\r\nthe Jumna, for two thousand years herds of black-buck, or sasin\r\nantelope, have roamed over cultivated fields so thickly garnished with\r\nhuman beings that to-day the rifle-shooting sportsman stands in hourly\r\nperil of bagging a five-hundred-rupee native every time he fires at an\r\nantelope.\r\n\r\nWherever rich agricultural lands exist, the big game must give\r\nway,--_from those lands_. To-day the bison could not survive in Iowa,\r\neastern Nebraska or eastern Kansas, any longer than a Shawnee Indian\r\nwould last on the Bowery. It was foredoomed that the elk, deer, bear and\r\nwild turkey should vanish from the rich farming regions of the East and\r\nthe middle West.\r\n\r\nTo-day in British East Africa lions are being hunted with dogs and shot\r\nwholesale, because they are a pest to the settlers and to the surviving\r\nherds of big game. At the same time, the settlers who are striving to\r\nwrest the fertile plains of B.E.A, from the domain of savagery declare\r\nthat the African buffalo, the zebra, the kongoni and the elephant are\r\npublic nuisances that must be suppressed by the rifle.\r\n\r\nEven the most ardent friend of wild life must admit that when a settler\r\nhas laboriously fenced his fields, and plowed and sowed, only to have\r\nhis whole crop ruined in one night by a herd of fence-breaking zebras,\r\nthe event is sufficient to abrade the nerves of the party most in\r\ninterest. While I take no stock in stories of dozens of \"rogue\"\r\nelephants that require treatment with the rifle, and of grown men being\r\nimperiled by savage gazelles, we admit that there are times when wild\r\nanimals can make nuisances of themselves. Let us consider that subject\r\nnow.\r\n\r\nWILD ANIMAL NUISANCES.--Complaints have come to me, at various times, of\r\ngreat destruction of lambs by eagles; of trout by blue herons; of crops\r\n(on Long Island) by deer; of pears destroyed by birds, and of valuable\r\npark trees by beavers that chop down trees not wisely but too well. I do\r\nnot, however, include in this category any cherries eaten by robins, or\r\norioles, or jays; for they are of too small importance to consider in\r\nthis court.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A FOOD SUPPLY OF WHITE-TAILED DEER\r\nThe Killing of the Does was Wrong]\r\n\r\nTo meet the legitimate demands for the abatement of unbearable\r\nwild-animal nuisances, I recommend the enactment of a law similar to\r\nSection 158 of the Game laws of New York, which provides for the safe\r\nand legitimate abatement of unbearable wild creatures as follows:\r\n\r\n  Section 158. _Power to Take Birds and Quadrupeds_. In the event that\r\n  any species of birds protected by the provisions of section two\r\n  hundred and nineteen of this article, or quadrupeds protected by\r\n  law, shall at any time, in any locality, become destructive of\r\n  private or public property, the commission shall have power in its\r\n  discretion to direct any game protector, or issue a permit to any\r\n  citizen of the state, to take such species of birds or quadrupeds\r\n  and dispose of the same in such manner as the commission may\r\n  provide. Such permit shall expire within four months after the date\r\n  of issuance.\r\n\r\nThis measure should be adopted by every state that is troubled by too\r\nmany, or too aggressive, wild mammals or birds.\r\n\r\nBut to return to the subject of big game and farming. We do not complain\r\nof the disappearance of the bison, elk, deer and bear from the farms of\r\nthe United States and Canada. The passing of the big game from all such\r\nregions follows the advance of real civilization, just so surely and\r\ncertainly as night follows day.\r\n\r\nBut this vast land of ours is not wholly composed of rich agricultural\r\nlands; not by any means. There are millions of acres of forest lands,\r\ngood, bad and indifferent, worth from nothing per acre up to one hundred\r\ndollars or more. There are millions of acres of rocky, brush-covered\r\nmountains and hills, wholly unsuited to agriculture, or even\r\nhorticulture. There are other millions of acres of arid plains and\r\narboreal deserts, on which nothing but thirst-proof animals can live and\r\nthrive. The South contains vast pine forests and cypress swamps,\r\nmillions of acres of them, of which the average northerner knows less\r\nthan nothing.\r\n\r\nWe can not stop long enough to look it up, but from the green color on\r\nour national map that betokens the forest reserves, and from our own\r\npersonal knowledge of the deserts, swamps, barrens and rocks that we\r\nhave seen, we make the estimate that _fully one-third_ of the total area\r\nof the United States is incapable of supporting the husbandman who\r\ndepends for his existence upon tillage of the soil. People may talk and\r\nwrite about \"dry farming\" all they please, but I wish to observe that\r\nfrom Dry-Farming to Success is a long shot, with many limbs in the way.\r\nWhen it rains sufficiently, dry farming is a success; but otherwise it\r\nis not; and we heartily wish it were otherwise.\r\n\r\nThe logical conclusion of our land that is utterly unfit for agriculture\r\nis a great area of land available for occupancy by valuable wild\r\nanimals. Every year the people of the United States are wasting\r\nuncountable millions of pounds of venison, because we are neglecting our\r\nopportunities for producing it practically without cost. Imagine for a\r\nmoment bestowing upon land owners the ability to stock with white-tailed\r\nand Indian sambar deer all the wild lands of the United States that are\r\nsuitable for those species, and permitting only bucks over one year of\r\nage to be shot. With the does even reasonably protected, the numerical\r\nresults in annual pounds of good edible flesh fairly challenges the\r\nimagination.\r\n\r\nAbout six years ago, Mr. C.C. Worthington's deer, in his fenced park, at\r\nShawnee-on-Delaware, Pennsylvania, became so numerous and so burdensome\r\nthat he opened his fences and permitted about one thousand head to go\r\nfree.\r\n\r\nWe are losing each year a very large and valuable asset in the\r\nintangible form of a million hardy deer that we might have raised but\r\ndid not! Our vast domains of wooded mountains, hills and valleys lie\r\npractically untenanted by big game, save in a few exceptional spots. We\r\nlose because we are lawless. We lose because we are too improvident to\r\nconserve large forms of wild life unless we are compelled to do so by\r\nthe stern edict of the law! The law-breakers, the game-hogs, the\r\nconscienceless doe-and-fawn slayers are everywhere! Ten per cent of all\r\nthe grown men now in the United States are to-day poachers, thieves and\r\nlaw-breakers, or else they are liable to become so to-morrow. If you\r\ndoubt it, try risking your new umbrella unprotected in the next mixed\r\ncompany of one hundred men that you encounter, in such a situation that\r\nit will be easy to \"get away\" with it.\r\n\r\nWe could raise two million deer each year on our empty wild lands; but\r\nwithout fences it would take half a million real game-wardens, on duty\r\nfrom dawn until dark, to protect them from destructive slaughter. At\r\npresent our land of liberty contains only 9,354 game wardens.[J] The\r\nstates that contain the greatest areas of wild lands naturally lack in\r\npopulation and in tax funds, and not one such state can afford to put\r\ninto the field even half enough salaried game wardens to really protect\r\nher game from surreptitious slaughter. The surplus of \"personal liberty\"\r\nin this liberty-cursed land is a curse to the big game. The average\r\nfrontiersman never will admit the divine right of kings, but he does\r\nardently believe in the divine right of settlers,--to reach out and take\r\nany of the products of Nature that they happen to fancy.\r\n\r\n[Footnote J: Of this force, there are only 1,200 salaried wardens. The\r\nmost of those who serve without salaries naturally render but little\r\ncontinuous or regular service.]\r\n\r\nWILD MEAT AS A FOOD SUPPLY.--We hear much these days about the high cost\r\nof living, but thus far we have made no move to mend the situation. With\r\ncoal going straight up to ten dollars per ton, beef going up to fifteen\r\ndollars per hundred on the hoof and wheat and hay going-up--heaven alone\r\nknows where, it is time for all Americans who are not rich to arouse and\r\ntake thought for the morrow. _What are we going to do about it_? The\r\ntariff on the coarser necessities of life is now booked to come down;\r\nbut what about the fresh meat supply?\r\n\r\nI desire to point out that between Bangor and San Diego and from Key\r\nWest to Bellingham, our country contains millions of acres of wild,\r\npractically uninhabited forests, rough foot-hills, bad-lands and\r\nmountains that could produce two million deer each year, without\r\ndeducting $50,000 a year from the wealth of the country. I grant that in\r\nthe total number of deer that would be necessary to produce two million\r\ndeer per annum, the farms situated on the edges of forests, and actually\r\nwithin the forests, would suffer somewhat from the depredations of those\r\ndeer. As I will presently show by documentary records, every one of\r\nthose individual damages that exceeds two dollars in value could be\r\ncompensated in cash, and afterward leave on the credit side of the deer\r\naccount an enormous annual balance.\r\n\r\nStop for a moment, you enterprising and restless men and women who\r\ntravel all over the United States, and think of the illimitable miles of\r\nunbroken forest that you have looked upon from your Pullman windows in\r\nthe East, in the South, in the West and in southern Canada. Recall the\r\nwooded mountains of the Appalachian system, the White Mountain region,\r\nthe pine forests of the Atlantic Coast and the Gulf States, the forests\r\nof Tennessee, Arkansas and southern Missouri; of northern Minnesota, and\r\nevery state of the Rocky Mountain region. Then, think of the silent and\r\nuntouched forests of the Pacific Coast and tell me whether you think\r\nfive million deer scattered through all those forests would make any\r\nvisible impression upon them. That would be only about twenty-five times\r\nas many as are there now! I think the forests would not be over\r\npopulated; and they would produce _two million killable deer each year_!\r\n\r\nLast year, 11,000 deer were forced down out of their hiding places in\r\nthe Rocky Mountains, and were killed in Montana. Even the natives had\r\nnot dreamed there were so many available; and they were slaughtered not\r\nwisely but too ill. It is not right that six members of one family\r\nshould \"hog\" twelve deer in one season. At present no deer supply can\r\nstand such slaughter.\r\n\r\nAssuming that the people of the United States _could_ be educated into\r\nthe idea of so conserving deer that they could draw two million head per\r\nyear from the general stock, what would it be worth?\r\n\r\nIt is not very difficult to estimate the value of a deer, when the whole\r\nanimal can be utilized. In various portions of the United States, deer\r\nvary in size, but I shall take all this into account, and try to strike\r\na fair average. In some sections, where deer are large and heavy, a\r\nfull-grown buck is easily worth twenty-five dollars. Let him who doubts\r\nit, try to replace those generous pounds of flesh with purchased beef\r\nand mutton and veal, and see how far twenty-five dollars will go toward\r\nit. Every man who is a householder knows full well how little meat one\r\ndollar will buy at this time.\r\n\r\nI think that throughout the United States as a whole every full-grown\r\ndeer, male or female contains on an average ten dollars worth of good\r\nmeat. I know of one large preserve which annually sells its surplus of\r\ndeer at that price, wholesale, to dealers; and in New York City\r\n(doubtless in many other cities, also) venison often has sold in the\r\nmarket at one dollar per pound!\r\n\r\nTwo million deer at $10 each mean $20,000,000. The licenses for the\r\nkilling of two million deer should cost one million men one dollar each;\r\nand that would pay 1,666 new game wardens each fifty dollars per month,\r\nall the year round. The damages that would need to be paid to farmers,\r\non account of crops injured by deer, would be so small that each county\r\ncould take care of its own cases, from its own treasury, as is done in\r\nthe State of Vermont.\r\n\r\nThere are certain essentials to the realization of a dream of two\r\nmillion deer per year that are absolutely required. They are neither\r\nobscure nor impossible.\r\n\r\nEach state and each county proposing to stock its vacant woods with deer\r\nmust resolutely educate its own people in the necessity of playing fair\r\nabout the killing of deer, and giving every man and every deer a square\r\ndeal. This is _not_ impossible! Not as a general thing, even though it\r\nmay be so in some specially lawless communities. If the _leading men_ of\r\nthe state and the county will take this matter seriously in hand, it can\r\nbe done in two years' time. The American people are not insensible to\r\nappeals to reason, when those appeals are made by their own \"home\r\nfolks.\" The governors, senators, assemblymen, judges, mayors and\r\njustices of the peace could, _if they would_, make a campaign of\r\neducation and appeal that would result in the creation of an immense\r\nvolume of free wild food in every state that possesses wild lands.\r\n\r\nWhen the shoe of Necessity pinches the People hard enough, remember the\r\npossibilities in deer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHITE-TAILED DEER\r\nIf Honestly and Intelligently Conserved, this Species could be made to\r\nProduce on our Wild Lands Two Million Deer per annum, as a new Food Supply\r\nFrom the \"American Natural History\"]\r\n\r\nThe best wild animal to furnish a serious food supply is the\r\nwhite-tailed deer. This is because of its persistence and fertility. The\r\nelk is too large for general use. An elk carcass can not be carried on a\r\nhorse; it is impossible to get a sled or a wagon to where it lies; and\r\nso, fully half of it usually is wasted! The mule deer is good for the\r\nRocky Mountains, and can live where the white-tail can not; but it is\r\n_too easy to shoot_! The Columbian black-tail is the natural species for\r\nthe forests of the Pacific states; but it is a trifle small in size.\r\n\r\nTHE EXAMPLE OF VERMONT.--In order to show that all the above is not\r\nbased on empty theory,--regarding the stocking of forests with deer,\r\ntheir wonderful powers of increase, and the practical handling of the\r\ndamage question,--let us take the experience and the fine example of\r\nVermont.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1875, a few sportsmen of Rutland, of whom the late Henry W.\r\nCheney was one, procured in the Adirondacks thirteen white-tailed deer,\r\nsix bucks and seven does. These were liberated in a forest six miles\r\nfrom Rutland, and beyond being protected from slaughter, they were left\r\nto shift for themselves. They increased, slowly at first, then rapidly,\r\nand by 1897, they had become so numerous that it seemed right to have a\r\nshort annual open season, and kill a few. From first to last, many of\r\nthose deer have been killed contrary to law. In 1904-5, it was known\r\nthat 294 head were destroyed in that way; and undoubtedly there were\r\nothers that were not reported.\r\n\r\n  ACCOUNT OF DEER KILLED IN VERMONT, OF RECORD SINCE KILLING\r\n                   BEGAN, IN 1897\r\n\r\n_From John W.

Clearly, it is more just that counties should settle\r\nthese damages than that they should be paid from the state treasury,\r\nbecause the counties paying damages have large compensation in the value\r\nof the deer killed each year. The hunting appears to be open to all\r\npersons who hold licenses from the state.\r\n\r\nIn order that the public at large may know the cost of the Vermont\r\nsystem, I offer the following digest compiled from the last biennial\r\nreport of the State Fish and Game Commissioner:\r\n\r\nDAMAGES PAID FOR DEER DEPREDATIONS IN VERMONT DURING\r\n                TWO YEARS\r\n\r\nTotal damages paid from June 8, 1908, to June 22, 1910    $4,865.98\r\nTotal number of claims paid                                     311\r\nTotal number of claims under $5                                  80\r\nNumber between $5 and $10, inclusive                            102\r\nNumber over $25 and under $51                                    23\r\nNumber between $50 and $100                                      11\r\nNumber in excess of $100                                          4\r\nNumber in excess of $200                                          1\r\nLargest claim paid                                          $326.50\r\n\r\nVALUE OF WHITE-TAILED DEER.--Having noted the fact that in two years\r\n(1908-9), the people of Vermont paid out $4,865 in compensation for\r\ndamages inflicted by deer, it is of interest to determine whether that\r\nmoney was wisely expended. In other words, did it pay?\r\n\r\nWe have seen that in the years 1908 and 9, the people of Vermont killed,\r\nlegally and illegally, and converted to use, 7,186 deer. This does not\r\ninclude the deer killed by dogs and by accidents.\r\n\r\nRegarding the value of a full-grown deer, it must be remembered that\r\nmuch depends upon the locality of the carcass. In New York or Pittsburg\r\nor Chicago, a whole deer is worth, at wholesale, at least twenty-five\r\ndollars. In Vermont, where deer are plentiful, they are worth a less\r\nsum. I think that fifteen dollars would be a fair figure,--at least low\r\nenough!\r\n\r\nEven when computed at fifteen dollars per carcass, those deer were worth\r\nto the people of Vermont $107,790. It would seem, therefore, that the\r\nsoundness of Vermont's policy leaves no room for argument; and we hope\r\nthat other states, and also private individuals, will profit by\r\nVermont's very successful experiment in bringing back the deer to her\r\nforests, and in increasing the food supply of her people.\r\n\r\nKILLING FEMALE DEER.--To say one word on this subject which might by any\r\npossibility be construed as favoring it, is like juggling with a lighted\r\ntorch over a barrel of gunpowder. Already, in Pennsylvania at least one\r\ngentleman has appeared anxious to represent me as favoring the killing\r\nof does, which in nine hundred and ninety-nine cases out of every\r\nthousand I distinctly and emphatically do not. The slaughter of female\r\nhoofed game animals is necessarily destructive and reprehensible, and\r\nnot one man out of every ten thousand in this country ever will see the\r\nplace and time wherein the opposite is true.\r\n\r\nAt present there are just two places in America, and I think only two,\r\nwherein there exists the slightest exception on this point. The state of\r\nVermont is becoming overstocked with deer, and the females have in\r\n_some_ counties (not in all), become so tame and destructive in\r\norchards, gardens and farm crops as to constitute a great annoyance. For\r\nthis reason, the experiment is being made of permitting does to be\r\nkilled under license, until their number is somewhat reduced.\r\n\r\nThe first returns from this trial have now come in, from the county game\r\nwardens of Vermont to the state game warden. Mr. John W. Titcomb. I will\r\nquote the gist of the opinion of each.\r\n\r\nThe State Commissioner says: \"This law should remain in force at least\r\nuntil there is some indication of a decrease in the number of deer.\"\r\nWarden W.H. Taft (Addison County) says: \"The killing of does I believe\r\ndid away with a good many of these tame deer that cause most of the\r\ndamage to farmers' crops.\" Harry Chase (Bennington County) says the\r\ndoe-killing law is \"a good law, and I sincerely trust it will not be\r\nrepealed.\" Warden Hayward of Rutland County says: \"The majority of the\r\nfarmers in this county are in favor of repealing the doe law.... A great\r\nmany does and young deer (almost fawns) were killed in this county\r\nduring the hunting season of 1909.\" R.W. Wheeler, of Rutland County\r\nsays: \"Have the doe law repealed! We don't need it!\" H.J. Parcher of\r\nWashington County finds that the does did more damage to the crops than\r\nthe bucks, and he thinks the doe law is \"a just one.\" R.L. Frost, of\r\nWindham County, judicially concludes that \"the law allowing does to be\r\nkilled should remain in force one or two seasons more.\" C.S Parker, of\r\nOrleans County, says his county is not overstocked with deer, and he\r\nfavors a special act for his county, to protect females.\r\n\r\nA summary of the testimony of the wardens is easily made. When deer are\r\ntoo plentiful, and the over-tame does become a public nuisance too great\r\nto be endured, the number should be reduced by regular shooting in the\r\nopen season; but,\r\n\r\nAs soon as the proper balance of deer life has been restored, protect\r\nthe does once more.\r\n\r\nThe pursuit of this policy is safe and sane, provided it can be wrought\r\nout without the influence of selfishness, and reckless disregard for the\r\nrights of the next generation. On the whole, its handling is like\r\nplaying with fire, and I think there are very, very few states on this\r\nearth wherein it would be wise or safe to try it. As a wise friend once\r\nremarked to me, \"Give some men a hinch, and they'll always try to take a\r\nhell.\" In Vermont, however, the situation is kept so well in hand we may\r\nbe sure that at the right moment the law providing for the decrease of\r\nthe number of does will be repealed.\r\n\r\nHIPPOPOTAMI AND ANTELOPES.--Last year a bill was introduced in the lower\r\nHouse of Congress proposing to provide funds for the introduction into\r\ncertain southern states of various animals from Africa, especially\r\nhippopotami and African antelopes. The former were proposed partly for\r\nthe purpose of ridding navigation of the water hyacinths that now are\r\nchoking many of the streams of Louisiana and Mississippi. The antelopes\r\nwere to be acclimatized as a food supply for the people at large.\r\n\r\nThis measure well illustrates the prevailing disposition of the American\r\npeople to-day,--to ignore and destroy their own valuable natural stock\r\nof wild birds and mammals, and when they have completed their war of\r\nextermination, reach out to foreign countries for foreign species.\r\nInstead of preserving the deer of the South, the South reaches out for\r\nthe utterly impossible antelopes of Africa, and the preposterous\r\nhippopotamus. The North joyously exterminates her quail and ruffed\r\ngrouse, and goes to Europe for the Hungarian partridge. That partridge\r\nis a failure here, and I am _heartily glad of it_, on the ground that\r\nthe exterminators of our native species do not deserve success in their\r\nefforts to displace our finest native species with others from abroad.\r\n\r\nThe hippo-antelope proposition is a climax of absurdity, in proposing\r\nthe replacing of valuable native game with impossible foreign species.\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nLAW AND SENTIMENT AS FACTORS IN PRESERVATION\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is grave danger that through ignorance of the true character of\r\nabout 80 per cent of the men and boys who shoot wild creatures, a great\r\nwrong will be done the latter. Let us not make a fatal mistake.\r\n\r\nAfter more than thirty years of observation among all kinds of\r\nsportsmen, hunters and gunners, I am convinced that it is utterly futile\r\nand deadly dangerous to rely on humane, high-class sentiment to diminish\r\nthe slaughter of wild things by game-hogs and pot-hunters.\r\n\r\nIn some respects, the term \"game-hog\" is a rude, rough word; but it is\r\nneeded in the English language, and it has come to stay. It is a\r\ndisagreeable term, but it was brought into use to apply to a class of\r\nvery disagreeable persons.\r\n\r\nA \"game-hog\" is a hunter of game who knows no such thing as sentiment or\r\nconscience in the killing of game, so long as he keeps within the limit\r\nof the law. Regardless of the scarcity of game, or of its hard struggle\r\nfor existence, he will kill right up to the bag limit every day that he\r\ngoes out, provided it is possible to do so. He uses the \"law\" as a salve\r\nfor the spot where his conscience should be. He will shoot with any\r\nmachine gun, or gun of big calibre, in every way that the law allows,\r\nand he knows no such thing as giving the game a square deal. He brags of\r\nhis big bags of game, and he loves to be photographed with a wagon-load\r\nof dead birds as a background. He believes in automatic and pump guns,\r\nspring shooting, longer open seasons and \"more game.\" He is quite\r\ncontent to shoot half tame ducks in a club preserve as they fly between\r\ncoop and pond, whenever he secures an opportunity. He will gladly sell\r\nhis game whenever he can do so without being found out, and sometimes\r\nwhen he is.\r\n\r\nOften a true sportsman drifts without realizing it into some one way of\r\nthe confirmed game-hog; but the moment he is made to realize his\r\nposition, he changes his course and his standing. The game-hog is\r\nimpervious to argument. You can shame a horse away from his oats more\r\neasily than you can shame him from doing \"what the Law allows.\"\r\n\r\nThere are hundreds of thousands of gentlemen and gentlewomen who never\r\nonce have come in touch with real cloven-footed game-hogs, who do not\r\nunderstand the species at all, and do not recognize its ear-marks.\r\nThousands of such persons will tell you: \"In my opinion, the best way to\r\nsave the wild life is to _educate the people_!\" I have heard that, many,\r\nmany times.\r\n\r\nFor right-hearted people, a little law is quite sufficient; and the best\r\npeople need none at all! But the game-hogs are different. For them, the\r\nstrict letter of the law, backed up by a strong-arm squad, is the only\r\ncontrolling influence that they recognize. To them it is necessary to\r\nsay: \"You shall!\" and \"You shall not!\"\r\n\r\nOnly yesterday the latest game-hog case was related to me by a\r\ngame-protector from Kansas. Into a certain county of southern Kansas,\r\nfrom which the prairie-chicken had been totally gone for a dozen years\r\nor more, a pair of those birds entered, settled down and nested. Their\r\ncoming was to many habitants a joyous event. \"Now,\" said the People, \"we\r\nwill care for these birds, and they will multiply, and presently the\r\ncounty will be restocked.\"\r\n\r\nBut Ahab came! Two men from another county, calling themselves sportsmen\r\nbut not entitled to that name, heard of those birds, and resolved to\r\n\"get them.\" They waited until the young were just leaving the nest: and\r\nthey went down and camped near by. On the first day they killed the two\r\nparent birds and half the flock of young birds, and the next day they\r\ngot all the rest.\r\n\r\nBut there is a sequel to this story. One of those men was a dealer in\r\nguns and ammunition; and when his customers heard what he had done,\r\n\"they simply put him out of business, by refusing to trade with him any\r\nmore.\" He is now washing dirty dishes in a restaurant; but at heart he\r\nis a game-hog, just the same.\r\n\r\nNear Bridgeport, Connecticut, a gentleman of my acquaintance owns a fine\r\nestate which is adorned with a trout stream and a superfine trout pond.\r\nOnce he invited a business man of Bridgeport to be his guest, and fish\r\nfor trout in his pond. On that guest, during a visit of three days all\r\nthe finest forms of hospitality were bestowed.\r\n\r\nTwo weeks later, my friend's game-warden caught that guest, early on a\r\nSunday morning, _poaching_ on the trout-pond, and spoiled his carefully\r\narranged get-away.\r\n\r\nIn his book \"Saddle and Camp in the Rockies,\" Mr. Dillon Wallace tells a\r\nstory of a man from New York who in the mountains of Colorado\r\ndeliberately corrupted his guides with money or other influences, shot\r\nmountain sheep _in midsummer_, and \"got away with it.\"\r\n\r\nIn northern Minnesota, George E. Wood has been having a hand-to-hand\r\nfight with the worst community of game-hogs and alien-born poachers of\r\nwhich I have heard. There appears to be no game law that they do not\r\nsystematically violate. The killers seem determined to annihilate the\r\nlast head of game, in spite of fines and imprisonments. The foreigners\r\nare absolutely uncontrollable. The latest feature of the war is the\r\ndiscovery of a tannery in the woods, where the hides of\r\nillegally-slaughtered deer and moose are dressed. Apparently the only\r\nkind of a law that will save the game of northern Minnesota is one that\r\nwill totally disarm the entire population.\r\n\r\nIn Pennsylvania, there exists an association which was formed for the\r\nexpress purpose of fighting the State Game Commission, preventing the\r\nenactment of a hunter's license law and repealing the law against the\r\nkilling of female deer and hornless fawns. The continued existence of\r\nthat organization on that basis would be a standing disgrace to the fair\r\nname of Pennsylvania. I think, however, that that organization was\r\nfounded on secret selfish purposes, and that ere long the general body\r\nof members will awaken to a realizing sense of their position, and range\r\nthemselves in support of the excellent policies of the commission.\r\n\r\nA POT-HUNTER is a man or boy who kills game as a business, for the money\r\nthat can be derived from its sale, or other use. Such men have the same\r\nfeelings as butchers. From their point of view, they can see no reason\r\nwhy all the game in the world should not be killed and marketed. Like\r\nthe feather-dealers, they wish to get out of the wild life all the money\r\nthere is in it; that is all. Left to themselves, with open markets they\r\nwould soon exterminate the land fauna of the habitable portions of the\r\nglobe.\r\n\r\nNo one can \"educate\" such people. For the gunners, game-hogs and\r\npot-hunters, there is no check, save specific laws that sternly and\r\namply safeguard the rights of the wild creatures that can not make laws\r\nfor themselves.\r\n\r\nNor can anyone educate the heartless woman of fashion who is determined\r\nto wear aigrettes as long as her money can buy them. The best women of\r\nthe world have _already been educated_ on the bird-millinery subject,\r\nand they are already against the use of the gaudy badges of slaughter\r\nand extermination. But in the great cities of the world there are\r\nthousands of women who are at heart as cruel as Salome herself, and\r\nwhose vicious tastes can be curbed only by the strong hand of the law.\r\n\"Sentiment\" for wild birds is not in them.\r\n\r\nBecause of the vicious and heartless elements among men and women, we\r\nsay, Give us _far-reaching, iron-bound_ LAWS for the protection of wild\r\nlife, _and plenty of courageous men to enforce them_.\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nTHE ARMY OF THE DEFENSE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt now seems that the friends of wild life who themselves are not on the\r\nfiring-line should be afforded some definite information regarding the\r\nArmy of the Defense, and its strength and weakness. It is an interesting\r\nsubject, but the limitations of space will not permit an extended\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\nOver the world at large, I think the active Destroyers outnumber the\r\nactive Defenders of wild life at least in the ratio of 500 to 1; and the\r\nmoney available to the Destroyers is to the funds of the Defenders as\r\n500 is to 1. The _average_ big-game sportsman cheerfully expends from\r\n$500 to $1,000 on a hunting trip, but resents the suggestion that he\r\nshould subscribe from $50 to $100 for wild life preservation. If he puts\r\ndown $10, he thinks he has done a Big Thing. Worse than this, I am\r\nforced to believe that at least 75 per cent of the big-game sportsmen of\r\nthe world never have contributed one dollar in money, or one hour of\r\neffort, to that cause. But there are exceptions; and I can name at least\r\nfifty sportsmen who have subscribed $100 each to campaign funds, and\r\nsome who have given as high as $1,000.\r\n\r\nOnce I sat down beside a financially rich slaughterer of game, and asked\r\nhim to subscribe a sum of real money in behalf of a very important\r\ncampaign. I needed funds very much; and I explained, exhorted and\r\nbesought. I pointed out his duty--_to give back something_ in return for\r\nall the game slaughter that he had _enjoyed_. For ten long minutes he\r\nstood fire without flinching, and without once opening his lips to\r\nspeak. He made no answer no argument, no defense and finally he never\r\ngave up one cent.\r\n\r\nWherever the English language is spoken, from Tasmania to Scotland, and\r\nfrom Porto Rico to the Philippines, the spirit of wild life protection\r\nexists. Elsewhere there is much more to be said on this point. To all\r\ncosmopolitan sportsmen, the British \"Blue Book\" on game protection, the\r\nannual reports of the two great protective societies of London, and the\r\nannual \"Progress\" report of the U.S. Department of Agriculture are\r\nreassuring and comforting. It is good to know that Uganda maintains a\r\nDepartment of Game Protection (A.L. Butler, Superintendent), that so\r\ngood a man as Maj. J. Stevenson-Hamilton is in control of protection in\r\nthe Transvaal, and that even the native State of Kashmir officially\r\nrecognizes the need to protect the Remnant.\r\n\r\nThere are of course many parts of the world in which game laws and\r\nlimits to slaughter are quite unknown: all of which is entirely wrong,\r\nand in need of quick correction. No state or nation can be accounted\r\nwholly civilized that fails to recognize the necessity to protect wild\r\nlife. I am tempted to make a list of the states and nations that were at\r\nlatest advices destitute of game laws and game protectors, but I fear to\r\ndo injustice through lack of the latest information. However, the time\r\nhas come to search out delinquents, and hold up to each one a mirror\r\nthat will reflect its shortcomings.\r\n\r\nNaturally, we are most interested in our own contingent of the Army of\r\nthe Defense.\r\n\r\nTHE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT.--To-day the feeling in Congress, toward\r\nthe conservation of wild life and forests is admirable. Both houses are\r\nfully awake to the necessity of saving while there is yet something to\r\nbe saved. The people of the United States may be assured that the\r\nnational government is active and sympathetic in the prosecution of such\r\nconservation measures as it might justly be expected to promote. For\r\nexample, during the past five years we have seen Congress take favorable\r\naction on the following important causes, nearly every one of which cost\r\nmoney:\r\n\r\nThe saving of the American bison, in four National ranges.\r\n\r\nThe creation of fifty-eight bird refuges.\r\n\r\nThe creation of five great game preserves.\r\n\r\nThe saving of the elk in Jackson Hole.\r\n\r\nThe protection of the fur seal.\r\n\r\nThe protection of the wild life of Alaska.\r\n\r\nThere are many active friends of wild life who confidently expect to see\r\nthis fine list gloriously rounded out by the passage in 1913 of an ideal\r\nbill for the federal protection of all migratory birds. To name the\r\nfriends of wild life in Congress would require the printing of a list of\r\nat least two hundred names, and a history of the rise and progress of\r\nwild life conservation by the national government would fill a volume.\r\nSuch a volume would be highly desirable.\r\n\r\nWhen the story of the national government's part in wild-life protection\r\nis finally written, it will be found that while he was president,\r\nTHEODORE ROOSEVELT made a record in that field that is indeed enough to\r\nmake a reign illustrious. He aided every wild-life cause that lay within\r\nthe bounds of possibility, and he gave the vanishing birds and mammals\r\nthe benefit of every doubt. He helped to establish three national bison\r\nherds, four national game preserves, fifty-three federal bird refuges,\r\nand to enact the Alaska game laws of 1902 and 1907.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1904 that the national government elected to accept its share\r\nof the white man's burden and enter actively into the practical business\r\nof wild life protection. This special work, originally undertaken and\r\ndown to the present vigorously carried on by Dr. Theodore S. Palmer, has\r\nconsiderably changed the working policy of the Biological Survey of the\r\nDepartment of Agriculture, and greatly influenced game protection\r\nthroughout the states. The game protection work of that bureau is alone\r\nworth to the people of this country at least twenty times more per annum\r\nthan the entire annual cost of the Bureau. Next to the splendid services\r\nof Dr. Palmer, all over the United States, one great value of the Bureau\r\nis found in the fact-and-figure ammunition that it prepares and\r\ndistributes for general use in assaults on the citadels of Ignorance and\r\nGreed. The publications of the Bureau are of great practical value to\r\nthe people of the United States.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NOTABLE PROTECTORS OF WILD LIFE (1)\r\nMADISON GRANT\r\nSecretary and Chairman Executive Committee, New York Zoological Society\r\n\r\nHENRY FAIRFIELD OSBORN\r\nPresident, New York Zoological Society\r\n\r\nJOHN F.

As the warfare grows more intense,\r\nCongress may find it necessary to enlarge the fighting force of the\r\nBiological Survey.\r\n\r\nThe work that has been done by the Bureau in determining the economic\r\nvalue or lack of value of our most important species of insectivorous\r\nbirds, has been worth millions to the agricultural interests of the\r\nUnited States. Through it we know where we stand. The reasons why we\r\nneed to strive for protection can be expressed in figures and\r\npercentages; and it seems to me that they leave the American people no\r\noption but to _protect_!\r\n\r\nSTATE GAME COMMISSIONS.--Each of our states, and each province of\r\nCanada, maintains either a State Game Commission of several persons, one\r\nCommissioner, or a State Game Warden. All such officers are officially\r\ncharged with the duty of looking after the general welfare of the game\r\nand other wild life of their respective states. Theoretically one of the\r\nchief duties of a State Game Commission is to initiate new legislative\r\nbills that are necessary, and advocate their translation into law. The\r\nofficial standing of most game commissioners is such that they can\r\nsuccessfully do this. In 1909 Governor Hughes of New York went so far as\r\nto let it be known that he would sign no new game bill that did not meet\r\nthe approval of State Game Commissioner James S. Whipple. As a general\r\nworking principle, and quite aside from Mr. Whipple, that was wrong;\r\nbecause even a State game commissioner is not necessarily infallible, or\r\nalways on the right side of every wild-life question.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, state commissioners and state wardens are keenly alive to the\r\nneeds of their states in new game protective legislation, and a large\r\npercentage of the best existing laws are due to their initiative. Often,\r\nhowever, their usefulness is limited by the trammels of public office,\r\nand there are times when such officers can not be too aggressive without\r\nthe risk of arousing hostile influences, and handicapping their own\r\ndepartmental work. For this reason, it is often advisable that bills\r\nwhich propose great and drastic reforms, and which are likely to become\r\nstorm-centers, should originate outside the Commissioner's office, and\r\nbe pushed by men who are perfectly free to abide the fortunes of open\r\nwarfare. It should be distinctly understood, however, that lobbying in\r\nbehalf of wild-life measures is _an important part of the legitimate\r\nduty of every state game commissioner_, and is a most honorable calling.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NOTABLE PROTECTORS OF WILD LIFE (II)\r\nEDWARD HOWE FORBUSH\r\nMassachusetts State Ornithologist\r\n\r\nT. GILBERT PEARSON\r\nSecretary, National Association of Audubon Societies\r\n\r\nJOHN B. BURNHAM\r\nPresident, American Game Protective and Propagation Association\r\n\r\nERNEST NAPIER\r\nPresident, Fish and Game Commission of New Jersey]\r\n\r\nOf the many strong and aggressive state game commissions that I would\r\nlike to mention in detail, space permits the naming of only a very few,\r\nby way of illustration.\r\n\r\nNEW YORK.--Thanks to the great conservation Governor of this state, John\r\nA. Dix, the year 1911 saw our forest, fish and game business established\r\non an ideal business basis. Realizing the folly of requiring a single\r\nman to manage those three great interests, and render to each the\r\nattention that it deserves and requires, by a well-studied legislative\r\nact a State Conservation Commission was created, consisting of three\r\ncommissioners, one for each of the three great natural departments.\r\nThese are salaried officers, who devote their entire time to their work,\r\nand are properly equipped with assistants. The state force of game\r\nwardens now consists of 125 picked men, each on a salary of $900 per\r\nyear, and through a rigid system of daily reports (inaugurated by John\r\nB. Burnham) the activities and results of each warden promptly become\r\nknown in detail at headquarters.\r\n\r\nFortunately, New York contains a very large number of true sportsmen,\r\nwho are ever ready to come forward in support of every great measure for\r\nwild-life protection. The spirit of real protection runs throughout the\r\nstate, and in time I predict that it will result in a great recovery of\r\nthe native game of the commonwealth. That will be after we have stopped\r\nall shooting of upland game birds and shore birds for about eight years.\r\nEven the pinnated grouse could be successfully introduced over one-third\r\nof the state, if the people would have it so. It was our great body of\r\nconscientious sportsmen who made possible the Bayne-Blauvelt law, and\r\nthe new codification of the game laws of the state.\r\n\r\nTENNESSEE.--Clearly, Honorable Mention belongs to the unsalaried State\r\nCommissioner of Tennessee, Col. J.H. Acklen, \"than whom,\" says Dr.\r\nPalmer, \"there is no more active and enthusiastic game protectionist in\r\nthis country. Whatever has been accomplished in that state is due to his\r\nactivity and public spirit. Col. Acklen, who is now president of the\r\nNational Association of Game Commissioners, is a prominent lawyer, and\r\nenjoys the distinction of being the only commissioner in the country who\r\nnot only serves without pay, but also defrays a large part of the\r\nexpenses of game protection out of his own pocket.\"\r\n\r\nSurely the Commonwealth of Tennessee will not long permit this\r\nunsupported condition of such a game commissioner to endure. That state\r\nhas a wild fauna worth preserving for her sons and grandsons, and it is\r\ninconceivable that the funds vitally necessary to this public service\r\ncan not be found.\r\n\r\nALABAMA.--I cite the case of Alabama because, in view of its position in\r\na group of states that until recently have cared little about game\r\nprotection, it may be regarded as an unusual case. Commissioner John H.\r\nWallace, Jr., has evolved order out of chaos,--and something approaching\r\na reign of law out of the absence of law. To-day the State of Alabama\r\nstands as an example of what can be accomplished by and through one\r\nclear-headed, determined man who is right, and knows that he is right.\r\n\r\nNEW JERSEY.--Alabama reminds one of New Jersey, and of State Game\r\nCommissioner Ernest Napier. I have seen him on the firing-line, and I\r\nknow that his strong devotion to the interests of the wild life of his\r\nstate, his determination to protect it at all costs, and his resistless\r\nconfidence in asking for what is right, have made him a power for good.\r\nThe state legislature believes in him, and enacts the laws that he says\r\nare right and necessary. He serves without salary, and gives to the\r\nstate time, labor and money. It is a pleasure to work with such a man.\r\nIn 1912 Commissioner Napier won a pitched battle with the makers of\r\nautomatic and pump guns, both shotguns and rifles, and debarred all\r\nthose weapons from use _in hunting_ in New Jersey unless satisfactorily\r\nreduced to two shots.\r\n\r\nMASSACHUSETTS.--The state of Massachusetts is fortunate in the\r\npossession of a very fine corps of ornithologists, nature lovers,\r\nsportsmen and leading citizens who on all questions affecting wild life\r\noccupy high ground and are not afraid to maintain it. It would be a\r\npleasure to write an entire chapter on this subject. The record of the\r\nMassachusetts Army of the Defense is both an example and an inspiration\r\nto the people of other states. Not only is the cause of protection\r\nchampioned by the State Game Commission but it also receives constant\r\nand powerful support from the State Board of Agriculture, which\r\nmaintains on its staff Mr. E.H. Forbush as State Ornithologist. The\r\nbird-protection publications of the Board are of great economic value,\r\nand they are also an everlasting credit to the state. The very latest is\r\na truly great wild-life-protection volume of 607 pages, by Mr. Forbush,\r\nentitled \"_Game Birds, Wild-Fowl and Shore Birds_.\" It is a publication\r\nmost damaging to the cause of the Army of Destruction, and I heartily\r\nwish a million copies might be printed and placed in the hands of\r\nlawmakers and protectors.\r\n\r\nThe fight last winter and spring for a no-sale-of-game law was the\r\nGettysburg for Massachusetts. The voice of the People was heard in no\r\nuncertain tones, and the Destroyers were routed all along the line. The\r\nleaders in that struggle on the protection side were E.H. Forbush,\r\nWilliam P. Wharton, Dr. George W. Field, Edward N. Goding, Lyman E.\r\nHurd, Ralph Holman, Rev. Wm. R. Lord and Salem D. Charles. With such\r\nleaders and such supporters, any wild-life cause can be won, anywhere!\r\n\r\nPENNSYLVANIA.--The case of Pennsylvania is rather peculiar. As yet there\r\nis no large and resistless organized body of real sportsmen to rally to\r\nthe support of the State Game Commission in great causes, as is the case\r\nin New York. As a result, with a paltry fund of only $20,000 for annual\r\nmaintenance, and much opposition from hunters and farmers, the situation\r\nis far from satisfactory. Fortunately Dr. Joseph Kalbfus, Secretary of\r\nthe Commission and chief executive officer, is a man of indomitable\r\ncourage and determination. But for this state of mind he would ere this\r\nhave given up the fight for the hunter's license law (of one dollar per\r\nyear), which has been bitterly opposed by a very aggressive and noisy\r\ngroup of gunners who do not seem to know that they are grievously\r\nmisled.\r\n\r\nFortunately, Commissioner John M. Phillips, of Pittsburgh is the ardent\r\nsupporter of Dr. Kalbfus and a vigorous fighter for justice to wild\r\nlife. He devotes to the cause a great amount of time and effort, and in\r\naddition to serving without salary he pays all his campaign expenses out\r\nof his own pocket. His only recompense for all this is the sincere\r\nadmiration of his friends, and the consciousness of having done his full\r\nduty toward the wild life and the people of his native state.\r\n\r\nTHE STATE AUDUBON SOCIETIES.--It is impossible to estimate the full\r\nvalue of the influence and work of the State Audubon Societies of the\r\nUnited States. Thus far these societies exist in thirty-nine states.\r\nFrom the beginning, their efforts have tended especially toward the\r\npreservation of the non-game birds, and it is well that the song and\r\nother insectivorous birds have thus been specially championed.\r\nUnfortunately, however, if that policy is pursued exclusively, it leaves\r\n154 very important species of game birds practically at the mercy of the\r\nArmy of Destruction! It would seem that the time has come when all\r\nAudubon Societies should take up, as a part of their work, active\r\nco-operation in helping to save the game birds from extermination.\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nTHE NATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS OF NEW YORK CITY\r\n\r\nOn January 1, 1895, the United States of America contained, so far as I\r\nam aware, not one organization of national scope which was devoting any\r\nlarge amount of its resources and activities to the protection of wild\r\nlife. At that time the former activities of the A.O.U. Committee on Bird\r\nProtection had lapsed. To-day the city of New York contains six national\r\norganizations, and it is now a great center of nation-wide activities in\r\nbehalf of preservation. Furthermore, these activities are steadily\r\ngrowing, and securing practical results.\r\n\r\nTHE NEW YORK ZOOLOGICAL SOCIETY.--In 1895 there was born into the world\r\na scientific organization having for its second declared object \"the\r\npreservation of our native animals.\" It was the first scientific society\r\nor corporation ever formed, so far as I am aware, having a specifically\r\ndeclared object of that kind. It owes its existence and its presence in\r\nthe field of wild-life conservation to the initiative and persistence of\r\nMr. Madison Grant and Prof. Henry Fairfield Osborn. For sixteen years\r\nthese two officers have worked together virtually as one man. It is not\r\nstrange to find a sportsman like Mr. Grant promoting the wild-life\r\ncause, but it is a fact well worthy of note that of all the zoologists\r\nof the world, Professor Osborn is the only one of real renown who has\r\nactively and vigorously engaged in this cause, and taken a place in the\r\nfront rank of the Defenders.\r\n\r\nMr. Grant's influence on the protection cause has been strong and\r\nfar-reaching,--far more so than the majority of his own friends are\r\naware. He has promoted important protectionist causes from Alaska to\r\nLouisiana and Newfoundland, and helped to win many important victories.\r\n\r\nTHE BOONE AND CROCKETT CLUB.--This organization of big game sportsmen\r\nwas founded in 1885, and is the oldest of its kind in the United\r\nStates. Its members always have supported the cause of protection, by\r\nlaw and by the making of game preserves. In all this work Mr. George\r\nBird Grinnell, for twenty-five years editor of _Forest and Stream_,\r\nhas been an important factor. As stated elsewhere, the club's written\r\nand unwritten code of ethics in big-game hunting is very strict. In\r\ncourse of time a Committee on Game Protection was formed, and it\r\nactively entered that field.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NOTABLE PROTECTORS OF WILD LIFE (III)\r\nJOSEPH KALBFUS\r\nChief Game Protector and Secretary, Pennsylvania Board of Game\r\nCommissioners\r\n\r\nJOHN M. PHILLIPS\r\nMember, Pennsylvania Board of Game Commissioners\r\n\r\nEDWARD A. McILHENNY\r\nFounder of Wild-Fowl Preserves in Louisiana\r\n\r\nCHARLES WILLIS WARD\r\nFounder of Wild-Fowl preserves in Louisiana]\r\n\r\nTHE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF AUDUBON SOCIETIES.--This organization was\r\nfounded by William Dutcher, in 1902, and in 1906 it was endowed to the\r\nextent of $322,000 by the bequest of Albert Wilcox. Subsequent\r\nendowments, together with the annual contributions of members and\r\nfriends, now give the Association an annual income of $60,000. It\r\nmaintains eight widely-separated field agents and lecturers and forty\r\nspecial game wardens of bird refuges. It maintains Secretary T. Gilbert\r\nPearson and a number of other good men constantly on the firing-line;\r\nand these forces have achieved many valuable results. After years of\r\nstress and struggle, it now seems almost certain that this organization\r\nwill save the two white egrets,--producers of \"the white badge of\r\ncruelty,\"--to the bird fauna of the United States, as in a similar\r\nmanner it has saved the gulls, terns and other sea birds of our lakes\r\nand coast line.\r\n\r\nThis splendid organization is one of the monuments to William Dutcher.\r\nMore than two years ago he was stricken with paralysis, and now sits in\r\nan invalid's chair at his home in Plainfield, New Jersey. His mind is\r\nclear and his interest in wild-life protection is keen, but he is unable\r\nto speak or to write. While he was active, he was one of the most\r\nresourceful and fearless champions of the cause of the vanishing birds.\r\nTo him the farmers of America owe ten times more than they ever will\r\nknow, and a thousand times more than they ever will repay, either to him\r\nor to his cause.\r\n\r\nTHE CAMP-FIRE CLUB OF AMERICA.--Although founded in 1897, this\r\norganization did not, as an organization, actively enter the field of\r\nprotection until 1909. Since that time its work has covered a wide\r\nfield, and enlisted the activities of many of its members. In order to\r\nprovide a permanent fund for its work, each year the club members pay\r\nspecial annual dues that are devoted solely to the wild-life cause. The\r\nCommittee on Game Protective Legislation and Preserves is a strong,\r\nhard-working body, and it has rendered good service in the lines of\r\nactivity named in its title.\r\n\r\nTHE AMERICAN GAME PROTECTIVE AND PROPAGATION ASSOCIATION.--This is the\r\nyoungest protective organization of national scope, having been\r\norganized in 1911. Its activities are directed by John B. Burnham, for\r\nfive years Chief Game Protector of the State of New York, and a man\r\nthoroughly conversant with the business of protection. The organization\r\nis financed chiefly by means of a large annual fund contributed by\r\nseveral of the largest companies engaged in manufacturing firearms and\r\nammunition, whose directors feel that the time has come when it is both\r\nwise and necessary to take practical measures to preserve the remnant of\r\nAmerican game. Already the activities of this organization cover a wide\r\nrange, and it has been particularly active in enlisting support for the\r\nWeeks bill for the federal protection of migratory birds.\r\n\r\nTHE WILD LIFE PROTECTIVE ASSOCIATION came into existence in 1910, rather\r\nsuddenly, for the purpose of promoting the cause of the Bayne\r\nno-sale-of-game bill, and other measures. It raised the fund that met\r\nthe chief expenses of that campaign. Since that time it has taken an\r\nimportant part in three other hotly contested campaigns in other states,\r\ntwo of which were successful.\r\n\r\nAt the present moment, and throughout the future, these New York\r\norganizations need _large sums of money_ with which to meet the\r\nlegitimate expenses of active campaigns for great measures. They need\r\n_some_ money from outside the state of New York! _Too much of the burden\r\nof national campaigning has been and is being left to be borne by the\r\npeople of New York City_. This policy is growing monotonous. There is\r\nevery reason why Chicago, St. Louis, Cincinnati, Pittsburgh, Cleveland,\r\nPhiladelphia, Baltimore and Boston should each year turn $100,000 into\r\nthe hands of these well-equipped and well managed national organizations\r\nwhose officers know _how to get results_, all over our country.\r\n\r\nSuch organizations as these do not exist in other cities; and this is\r\nvery unfortunate. New Orleans should be a center of protectionist\r\nactivity for the South, San Francisco for the Pacific slope, and Chicago\r\nfor the Middle West. Will they not become so?\r\n\r\nTWO INDEPENDENT WORKERS.--At the western edge of the delta of the\r\nMississippi there have arisen two men who loom up into prominence at an\r\noutpost of the Army of Defense which they themselves have established.\r\nFor what they already have done in the creation of wild-fowl preserves\r\nin Louisiana, Edward A. McIlhenny and Charles Willis Ward deserve the\r\nthanks of the American People-at-large. An account of their splendid\r\nactivities, and the practical results already secured, will be found in\r\nChapter XXXVIII, on \"Private Game Preserves,\" and in the story of Marsh\r\nIsland. Already the home of these gentlemen, Avery Island, Louisiana,\r\nhas become an important center of activity in wild-life protection.\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nHOW TO MAKE A NEW GAME LAW\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LINE OF ACTION.--In the face of a calamity, the saving of life and\r\nproperty and the check of fire and flood depends upon good judgment and\r\nquick action at the critical moment. In emergencies, the slow and\r\nacademic method will not serve. It is the run, the jump, the short cut\r\nand the violent method that saves life. If a woman is drowning, the\r\nsensible man does not wait for an introduction to her; nor does he run\r\nto an acquaintance to borrow his boat, or stop to put on a collar and\r\nnecktie. He seizes the first boat that he can find, and breaks its lock\r\nand chain if necessary; or, failing that, he plunges in without one.\r\nWhen he reaches the imperiled party, he doesn't say, \"Will you kindly\r\nlet me save you?\" He seizes her by the hair, and tries to keep her head\r\nabove water, without ceremony.\r\n\r\nThat is to-day the condition and the treatment necessary regarding our\r\nremnant of wild life. We are compelled to act quickly, directly, and\r\neven violently at times, if we save anything worth while.\r\n\r\nThere is _no time_ to depend upon the academic \"education\" of the public\r\nby the seductive illustrated lecture on birds, or the article about the\r\nhabits of mammals. Those methods are all well enough in their places,\r\nbut we must not depend upon them in emergencies like the present, for\r\nthey do not pass laws or arrest lawbreakers. Give the public all of that\r\nmaterial that you can supply, and the more the better, but for heaven's\r\nsake _do not_ depend upon the spread of bird-lore \"education\" to stop\r\nthe work of the game-hogs! If you do, all the wild life will be\r\ndestroyed while the educational work is going on.\r\n\r\nOften you can educate a gunner, and make him a protectionist; but you\r\nnever can do it by showing him pictures of birds. He needs strong\r\nreasoning and exhortation, not bird-lore. To-day it is necessary to\r\nemploy the most direct, forceful and at times even rude methods. Where\r\nslaughtering cannot be stopped by moral suasion, it must be stopped with\r\na hickory club. The thing to do is to _get results, and get them\r\nquickly, before it is too late_!\r\n\r\nIf the business section of a town is burning down, no one goes into the\r\nsuburbs to lecture on architecture, or exhibit pictures of fire\r\napparatus. The rush is for water, fire-engines, red-blooded men and\r\ndynamite. When the birds all around you are being shot to death by\r\npoachers who fear not God nor regard man, and you need help to stop it\r\non the instant, run to your neighbor's house, and ring his bell. If he\r\nfails to hear the bell, pound on his door until you jar the whole house.\r\n\r\nWhen he comes down half-dressed, blinking and rubbing his eyes, shout\r\nat him:\r\n\r\n\"Come out! Your birds are all being shot to pieces!\"\r\n\r\n\"Are they?\" he will say. \"But what can _I_ do about it? I can't help it!\r\nI'm no game warden.\"\r\n\r\n\"Put on your clothes, get your shot-gun and come out and drive off the\r\nkilling gang.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what good will that do? They will come back again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not if we do our duty. We must have them arrested, and appear against\r\nthem in court.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" says the sleepy citizen, \"That won't do much good. The laws are\r\nnot strict enough; and besides, they are not well enforced, even as they\r\nare!\"\r\n\r\n\"Then let's make it our business to see that the present laws are\r\nenforced, and go to our members of the legislature, and have them pass\r\nsome stronger laws.\"\r\n\r\nAnd this brings me to a very important subject:\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nHOW TO PASS A NEW LAW\r\n\r\nWe venture to say that the average citizen little realizes how possible\r\nit is to secure the passage of a law that is clearly necessary for the\r\nbetter protection of wild life and forests. Because of this, and of the\r\nnecessity for exact knowledge, I shall here set down specific\r\ninstructions on this subject.\r\n\r\nTHE PERSONAL EQUATION.--One determined man can secure the passage of a\r\ngood law, provided he is reasonably intelligent and sufficiently\r\ndetermined. The man who starts a movement must make up his mind to\r\nfollow it up, direct its fortunes, stay with it when the storms of\r\nopposition beat upon it, and never give up until it is signed by the\r\ngovernor. He must be willing to sacrifice his personal convenience, many\r\nof his pleasures, and work when his friends are asleep or pleasuring.\r\n\r\nIn working for the protection of wild life there is one mighty and\r\nunfailing source of consolation. It is this:\r\n\r\n_Your cause always gains in strength, and the cause of the destroyers\r\nalways loses strength!_\r\n\r\nTHE CHOICE OF A CAUSE.--Be broad-minded. Do not rush to the legislature\r\nwith a demand for a law to permit the taking of bull-heads with\r\nJune-bugs in the creeks of your township, or to give your county a\r\nspecially early open season on quail in order that your boy may try his\r\nnew gun before he goes back to college. _Don't propose any \"local\"\r\nlegislation_; for in progressive states, local game legislation is\r\ncoming strongly into disfavor,--just as it should! Legislate for your\r\nwhole state, and nothing less.\r\n\r\nDo not bother your legislature with a trivial bill. Choose a cause that\r\nis worth while to grown men, and it shall be well with you. It takes no\r\nmore time to pass a large bill than a small one; and big men prefer to\r\nbe identified with big measures.\r\n\r\nBefore you have a bill drawn, advise with men whose opinions are worth\r\nhaving. If the end you have in mind is a great and good one, _go ahead_,\r\nwhether you secure support in advance or not. If the needs of the hour\r\nclearly demand the measure, _go ahead_, even though you start absolutely\r\nalone. A good measure never goes far without attracting company.\r\n\r\nDRAFTING A BILL.--As a rule, the members of a legislative body do not\r\nhave time to draft bills on subjects that are new or strange to them. A\r\nshort bill is easily prepared by your own representative; but a lengthy\r\nbill, covering a serious reform, is a different matter. Hire a lawyer to\r\ndraft the bill for you. A really good lawyer will not charge much for\r\ndrafting a bill that is to benefit the public, and grind no private axe;\r\nbut if the bill is long, and requires long study, even the good citizen\r\nmust charge something.\r\n\r\nYour bill must fully recognize existing laws. It must be either\r\nprohibitory or permissive; which means that it can say what shall not be\r\ndone, or else that which may be done according to law, all other acts\r\nbeing forbidden. Your lawyer must decide which form is best. For my\r\npart, I greatly prefer the prohibitive form, as being the stronger and\r\nmore impressive of the two. I think it is the province of the law _to\r\nforbid_ the destruction of wild life and forests, under penalties.\r\n\r\nPENALTIES.--Every law should provide a penalty for its infringement; but\r\nthe penalty should not be out of all proportion to the offense. It is\r\njust as unwise to impose a fine of one dollar for killing song-birds for\r\nfood as it is to provide for a fine of three hundred dollars. A fine\r\nthat is too small fails to impress the prisoner, and it begets contempt\r\nfor the law and the courts! A fine that is altogether too high is apt to\r\nbe set aside by the court as \"excessive.\" In my opinion, the best fines\r\nfor wild life slaughter would be as follows:\r\n\r\nShooting, netting or trapping song-birds, and other non-game\r\n  birds, each bird                                          $5 to $25\r\nKilling game birds out of season, each bird                 10 to  50\r\nSelling game contrary to law, each offense                 100 to 200\r\nDynamiting fish                                            100 to 200\r\nSeining or netting game fishes                              50 to 200\r\nShooting birds with unfair weapons                          10 to 100\r\nKilling an egret, Carolina parakeet or whooping crane      100 to 200\r\nKilling a mountain sheep or antelope anywhere in the U.S.         500\r\nKilling an elk contrary to law                                     50\r\nKilling a female deer, or fawn without horns, each offense         50\r\nTrapping a grizzly bear for its skin                              100\r\n\r\nFor killing a man \"by mistake,\" the fine should be $500, payable in five\r\nannual instalments, to the court, for the family of the victim.\r\n\r\nWhenever fines are not paid, the convicted party should be sentenced to\r\nimprisonment at hard labor at the rate of one-half day for each dollar\r\nof the fine imposed; and a sentence at hard labor should be the _first\r\noption of the court_! Many a rich and reckless poacher snaps his fingers\r\nat fines; but a sentence to hard labor would strike terror to the heart\r\nof the most brazen of them. To all such men, \"labor\" is the twin terror\r\nto \"death.\"\r\n\r\nTHE INTRODUCTION OF A BILL.--Much wisdom is called for in the selection\r\nof legislative champions for wild-life bills. It is possible to state\r\nhere only the leading principles involved.\r\n\r\nOf course it is best to look for an introducer within the political\r\nparty that is in the majority. A man who has many important bills on his\r\nhands is bound to give his best attention to his own pet measures; and\r\nit is best to choose a man who is not already overloaded. If a man has a\r\nhost of enemies, pass him by. By all means choose a man whose high\r\ncharacter and good name will be a tower of strength to your cause; and\r\nif necessary, _wait for him to make up his mind_. Mr. Lawrence W.\r\nTrowbridge waited three long and anxious weeks in the hope that Hon.\r\nGeorge A. Blauvelt would finally consent to champion the Bayne bill in\r\nthe New York Assembly. At last Mr. Blauvelt consented to take it up; and\r\nthe time spent in waiting for his decision was a grand investment! He\r\nwas the Man of all men to pilot that bill through the Assembly.\r\n\r\nVery often the \"quiet man\" of a legislative body is a good man to\r\nchampion a new and drastic measure. The quiet man who makes up his mind\r\nto take hold of \"a hard bill to pass\" often astonishes the natives by\r\nhis ability to get results. Representative John F. Lacey, of Iowa, made\r\nhis name a household word all over the United States by the quiet,\r\nsteady, tireless and finally resistless energy with which for three long\r\nyears in Congress he worked for \"the Lacey bird bill.\" For years his\r\ncolleagues laughed at him, and cheerfully voted down his bill. But he\r\npersisted. His cause steadily gained in strength; and his final triumph\r\nlaid the axe at the root of a thousand crimes against wild life,\r\nthroughout the length and breadth of this land. He rendered the people\r\nof America a service that entitles him to our everlasting gratitude and\r\nremembrance.\r\n\r\nAFTER THE INTRODUCTION OF A BILL.--As soon as a bill is introduced it is\r\nreferred to a committee, to be examined and reported upon. If there is\r\nopposition,--and to every bill that really does something worth while\r\nthere always is opposition,--then there is a \"hearing.\" The committee\r\nappoints a day, when the friends and foes of the bill assemble, and\r\nexpress their views.\r\n\r\nThe week preceding a hearing is your busy week. You must plan your\r\ncampaign, down to the smallest details. Pick the men whom you wish to\r\nhave speak (for ten minutes each) on the various parts of your bill, and\r\ndivide the topics and the time between them. Call upon the friends of\r\nthe bill in various portions of the state to attend and \"say something.\"\r\nGo up with a strong body of fine men. _Have as many organizations\r\nrepresented as you possibly can_! The \"organizations\" represent the\r\ngreat mass of people, and the voters also.\r\n\r\nWhen you reach the hearing, hand to your bill's champion, who will be\r\nfloor manager for your side, a clear and concise list of your speakers,\r\ncarefully arranged and stating who's who. That being done, you have only\r\nto fill your own ten minutes and afterward enjoy the occasion.\r\n\r\nTHE VALUE OF ACCURACY.--It is unnecessary to say, in working for a\r\nbill,--_always be sure of your facts_. Never let your opponents catch\r\nyou tripping in accuracy of statement. If you make one serious error,\r\nyour enemies will turn it against you to the utmost. Better understate\r\nfacts than overstate them. This shrewd old world quickly recognizes the\r\ncareful, conservative man whose testimony is so true and so rock-founded\r\nthat no assaults can shake it. Legislators are quick to rely on the\r\nwords and opinions of the man who can safely be trusted. If your enemies\r\ntry to overwhelm you with extravagant statements, that are unfair to\r\nyour cause, the chances are that the men who judge between you will\r\nrecognize them by their ear-marks, and discount them accordingly.\r\n\r\nWORK WITH MEMBERS.--Sometimes a subject that is put before a legislative\r\nbody is so new, and the thing proposed is so drastic, it becomes\r\nnecessary to take measures to place a great many facts before each\r\nmember of the body. Under such circumstances the member naturally\r\ndesires to be \"shown.\" The cleanest and finest campaigning for a reform\r\nmeasure is that in which both sides deal with facts, rather than with\r\npersonal importunities. With a good cause in hand, it is a pleasure to\r\nprepare concise statements of facts and conditions from which a\r\nlegislator may draw logical conclusions. Whenever a bill can be won\r\nthrough in that way, game protection work becomes a delight.\r\n\r\nIn all important new measures affecting the rights and the property of\r\nthe whole people of a state, the conscientious legislator wishes to know\r\nhow the people feel about it. When you tell him that \"The wild life\r\nbelongs to the whole people of the state; and this bill is in their\r\ninterest,\" he needs to know for certain that your proposition is true.\r\nSometimes there is only one way in which he can be fully convinced; and\r\nthat is by the people of his district.\r\n\r\nThen it becomes necessary to send out a general alarm, and call upon the\r\nPeople to write to their representatives and express _their_ views. Give\r\nthem, in printed matter, the _latest facts_ in the case, forecast the\r\nfuture as you think it should be forecast, then demand that the men and\r\nwomen who are interested do write to their senators and assemblyman, and\r\nexpress _their_ views, in _their own way!_ Let there be no \"machine\r\nletters\" sent out, all ready for signature; for such letters are a waste\r\nof effort, and belong in the waste baskets to which they are quickly\r\nconsigned. The members of legislative bodies hate them, and rightly,\r\ntoo. They want to hear from men who can think for themselves, give\r\nreasons of their own, and express their desires in their own way.\r\n\r\nTHE PRESS AND THE NEWSPAPERS.--It is impossible to overestimate the\r\ninfluence of the newspapers and the periodical press in general, in the\r\nprotection of wild life. But for their sympathy, their support and their\r\nindependent assaults upon the Army of Destruction, our game species\r\nwould nearly all of them have been annihilated, long ago. Editors are\r\nsympathetic and responsive good-citizens, as keenly sensitive regarding\r\ntheir duties as any of the rest of us are, and from the earliest times\r\nof protection they have been on the firing line, helping to beat back\r\nthe destroyers. It is indeed a rare sight to see an editor giving aid,\r\ncomfort or advice to the enemy. I can not recall more than a score of\r\narticles that I have seen or heard of during thirty years in this field\r\nthat opposed the cause of wild life protection.[K] At this moment, for\r\ninstance, I bear in particularly grateful remembrance the active\r\ncampaign work of the following newspapers:\r\n\r\n[Footnote K: Just one hour after the above paragraph was written, a long\r\ntelegram from San Francisco advised me that the _Examiner_ of that city\r\nhad begun an active and aggressive campaign for the sale of all kinds of\r\ngame.]\r\n\r\nThe New York Times\r\nThe New York Tribune\r\nThe New York Herald\r\nThe New York Globe\r\nThe New York Mail and Express\r\nThe New York World\r\nThe New York Sun\r\nThe Springfield (Mass.) Republican\r\nThe Chicago Inter-Ocean\r\nThe San Francisco Call\r\nThe Rochester Union and Advertiser\r\nThe Victoria Colonist\r\nThe Brooklyn Standard-Union\r\nThe New York Evening Post\r\nThe New York Press\r\nThe Buffalo News\r\nThe Minneapolis Journal\r\nThe Pittsburgh Index-Appeal\r\nThe St. Louis Globe-Democrat\r\nThe Philadelphia North American\r\nThe Utica Observer\r\nThe Washington Star.\r\n\r\nThese magazines have done good service in the cause; and some of them\r\nhave spent many years on the firing line:\r\n\r\nForest and Stream\r\nThe American Field\r\nField and Stream\r\nRecreation (old and new)\r\nRod and Gun in Canada\r\nIn the Open\r\nSports Afield\r\nWestern Field\r\nOutdoor Life\r\nShield's Magazine\r\nSportsman's Review\r\nOuting\r\nCollier's Weekly\r\nThe Independent\r\nCountry Life\r\nOutdoor World\r\nBird Lore\r\n\r\nIn campaigning, always appeal for the help of the newspapers. If there\r\nare no private axes to grind, they help generously. The weekly journals\r\nare of value, but the monthlies are printed so long in advance of their\r\ndates of issue that they seldom move fast enough to keep abreast of the\r\nprocession. Their mechanical limitations are many and serious.\r\n\r\nEvery newspaper likes \"exclusive\" news, letters and articles. On that\r\nbasis they will print about all the live matter that you can furnish.\r\nBut at the same time, the important news of the campaign _must_ be sent\r\nto the press broadcast, in the form of printed slips all ready for the\r\nforeman. Many of these are never used, but the others are; and it pays.\r\nThe news in every slip must be vouched for by the sender, or it will not\r\nbe used. Often it will appear as a letter signed by the sender; which is\r\nall right, only the news is most effective when printed without a\r\nsignature. Do not count on the Associated Press; because its peculiar\r\ndemands render it almost impossible for it to be utilized in game\r\nprotection work.\r\n\r\nHOW TO MEET OPPOSITION.--There is no rule for the handling of opposition\r\nthat is fair and open. For opposition that is unfair and under-handed,\r\nthere is one powerful weapon,--Publicity. The American people love fair\r\nplay, and there is nothing so fatal to an unfair fighter as a\r\nsearchlight, turned full on him without fear and without mercy. If it is\r\nreliably and persistently reported that some citizen who ought to be on\r\nthe right side has for some dark reason become active on the wrong side,\r\nprint the reports in a large newspaper, and ask him publicly if they are\r\ntrue. If the reports are false, he can quickly come out in a letter and\r\nsay so, and end the matter. If they are true, the public will soon know\r\nit, and act accordingly.\r\n\r\nETERNAL VIGILANCE.--The progress of a bill must be watched by some\r\ncompetent person from day to day, and finally from hour to hour. I know\r\none bill that was saved from defeat only because its promoter dragged\r\nit, almost by force, out of the hands of a tardy clerk, and accompanied\r\nit in person to the senate, where it was passed in the last hour of a\r\nsession.\r\n\r\nA bill should not be left to a long slumber in the drawer of a\r\ncommittee. Such delays nearly always are dangerous.\r\n\r\nSIGNING THE BILL.--The promoter of a great measure always seeks the\r\nsympathy of the Chief Executive early in the day; but he should not make\r\nthe diplomatic error of trying to exact promises or pledges in advance.\r\nGood judges do not give away their decisions in advance.\r\n\r\nBecause a Chief Executive remarks after a bill has been sent to him for\r\nsigning that he \"cannot approve it,\" it is no reason to give up in\r\ndespair. Many an executive approval has been snatched at the last\r\nmoment, as a brand from the burning. _Ask for a hearing before the bill\r\nis acted upon_. At the hearing, and before it and after, the People who\r\nwish the bill to become a law must express themselves,--by letter, by\r\ntelegram, and by appeal in person. If the governor becomes convinced\r\nthat an _overwhelming majority_ of his people desire him to sign the\r\nbill, _he will sign it_, even though personally he is opposed to it! The\r\nhall mark of a good governor is a spirit of obedience to the will of the\r\ngreat majority.\r\n\r\nNot until your bill has been signed by the governor are you ready to go\r\nhome with a quiet mind, take off your armor, and put your ear to the\r\ntelephone while you hear some one say as your only reward,--\"Well done,\r\ngood and faithful servant.\"\r\n\r\nAS TO \"CREDIT.\"--Do not count upon receiving any credit for what you do\r\nin the cause of game protection, outside the narrow circle of your own\r\nfamily and your nearest friends. This is a busy world; and the human\r\nmind flits like a restless bird from one subject to another. The men who\r\nwin campaigns are forgotten by the general public, in a few hours! There\r\nis nothing more fickle or more fleeting than the bubble called \"popular\r\napplause.\" Judging by the experiences of great men, I should say that it\r\nhas no substance, whatever. The most valuable reward of the man who\r\nfights in a great cause, and helps to win victories, is the profound\r\nsatisfaction that comes to every good citizen who bravely does his whole\r\nduty, and leaves the world better than he found it, without the\r\nslightest thought of gallery applause.\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\nNEW LAWS NEEDED: A ROLL-CALL OF THE STATES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe principles of wild-life protection and encouragement are now so\r\nfirmly established as to leave little room for argument regarding their\r\nvalue. When they are set forth before the people of any given state, the\r\nonly question is of willingness to do the right thing; of duty or a\r\ndefiance of duty; of good citizenship or the reign of selfishness. Men\r\nwho do not wish to do their duty purposely befog great issues by noisy\r\ntalk and tiresome academic discussions of trivial details; and such men\r\nare the curse and scourge of reform movements.\r\n\r\nThere are a very few persons who foolishly assert that \"there are too\r\nmany game laws!\" It is entirely wrong for any person to make such a\r\nstatement, for it tends to promote harmful error. The fact that our laws\r\nare _too lenient_, or are not fully enforced, is no excuse for\r\ndenouncing their purposes. We have all along been too timid, too self\r\nindulgent, and too much afraid of hurting the feelings of the game-hogs.\r\n\r\nGive me the power to make the game laws of any state or province and I\r\nwill guarantee to save the _non-migratory_ wild life of that region. I\r\nwill not only make adequate laws, but I will also provide means, men and\r\npenalties by which _they will be enforced_! It is easy and simple, for\r\nmen who are not afraid.\r\n\r\nI have been at considerable pains to analyze the game laws of each\r\nstate, ascertain their shortcomings, and give a list of the faults that\r\nneed correction by new legislation. It has required no profound wisdom\r\nto do this, because the principles involved are so plain that any\r\nintelligent schoolboy fifteen years old can master them in one hour. I\r\nhave performed this task hopefully, in the belief that in many states\r\nthe real issues have not been plainly put before the people. Hereafter\r\nno state shall destroy its wild life through ignorance of the laws that\r\nwould preserve it.\r\n\r\nLet no man say that \"it is too late to save the wild life\"; for\r\nexcepting the dead-and-gone species, that is not true. Let no man say\r\nthat \"we can not save the wild life by law\"; for that is not true,\r\neither. As long as laws are lax, even law-abiding people will take\r\nadvantage of them.\r\n\r\nThere are millions of men who think it is _right to kill all the game\r\nthat the law allows_! There are thousands of women who think it is right\r\nto wear aigrettes as long as the law permits their sale! And yet, if we\r\nare resolute and diligent there is plenty of hope for the future. During\r\nthe past three years, to go no farther back, we have seen the whole\r\nstate of New York swept clean of the traffic in native wild game by the\r\nBayne law, and of the traffic in wild birds' plumage on women's hats\r\nthrough the Dutcher law. To-day, in this state, we find ninety-nine\r\nwomen out of every one hundred wearing flowers, and laces, and plush and\r\nsatin on their hats, instead of the heads, bodies and feathers of wild\r\nbirds that were the regular thing until three years ago. The change has\r\nbeen a powerful commentary on the value of good laws for the protection\r\nof wild life. The Dutcher law has caused the plumage of wild birds\r\n_almost wholly to disappear from the State of New York_!\r\n\r\nWe shall here point out the plain duty of each state; and then it will\r\nbe up to them, individually, to decide whether they can stand the\r\nblood-test or not.\r\n\r\nA state or a nation can be ungentlemanly, unfair or mean, just the same\r\nas an individual. No state has a right to maintain shambles for the\r\nslaughter of migratory game or song birds that belong in part to sister\r\nstates. _Every state holds its migratory bird life in trust, for the\r\nbenefit of the people of the nation at large_. A state is just as\r\nresponsible for its treatment of wild life as any individual; and it is\r\ntime to open books of account.\r\n\r\nIt is robbery, as well as murder, for any southern state to slaughter\r\nthe robins of the northern states, where no robins may be killed. _No\r\nsouthern gentleman can permit such doings, after the crime has been\r\npointed out to him_! In the North, the men who are caught shooting\r\nrobins are instantly haled to court, and fined or imprisoned. If we of\r\nthe North should kill for food the mockingbirds that visit us, the\r\npeople of the South instantly would brand us as monsters of greed and\r\nmeanness; and they would be perfectly justified in so doing.\r\n\r\nLet us at least be honest in \"agreeing upon a state of fact,\" as the\r\nlawyers say, whether we act sensibly and mercifully or not. Just so long\r\nas there remains in this land of ours a fauna of game birds, and the\r\ngunners of one-half the states are allowed to dictate the laws for the\r\nslaughter of it, just so long will our present protection remain utterly\r\nabsurd and criminally inadequate. Look at these absurdities:\r\n\r\nNew York, New Jersey and many other northern states rigidly prohibit the\r\nlate winter and spring shooting of waterfowl and shore birds, and limit\r\nthe bag; North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, and other southern\r\nstates not only slaughter wild fowl and shore birds all winter and\r\nspring, without limit, but several of them kill certain non-game birds\r\nbesides!\r\n\r\nAll the northern states protect the robin, for the good that it does;\r\nbut in North Carolina, Tennessee, Mississippi, Louisiana and some other\r\nsouthern states, thousands of robins are shot for food. Minnesota has\r\nstopped spring shooting; but her sister state on the south, Iowa,\r\nobstinately refuses to do so.\r\n\r\nTHE UNITED STATES AT LARGE.--There are two great measures that should be\r\ncarried into effect by the governing body of the United States. One is\r\nthe enactment of a law providing federal protection for all migratory\r\nbirds; and Canada and Mexico should be induced to join with the United\r\nStates _in an international treaty to that effect_.\r\n\r\nThe other necessary measure is the passage of a joint resolution of\r\nCongress _declaring every national forest and forest reserve also a game\r\npreserve and general sanctuary for wild life_, in which there shall be\r\nno hunting or killing of wild creatures of any kind save predatory\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nThe tendency of the times,--and the universal slaughter of wild life on\r\nthis continent,--point straight as an arrow flies in that direction.\r\nSoon or late, we have GOT to come to it! If Congress does not take the\r\ninitiatory steps, _the People will_! Such a consummation is necessary;\r\nit is justified by common sense and the inexorable logic of the\r\nsituation, and when done it will be right.\r\n\r\nThe time was when the friends of wild life did not dare speak of this\r\nsubject in Washington save in whispers. That was in the days when the\r\nAppalachian Park bill could not be passed, and when there were angry\r\nmutterings and even curses leveled against Gifford Pinchot and the\r\nForestry Bureau because so many national forests were being set aside.\r\nThat was in the days when a few western sheep-men thought that they\r\nowned the whole Rocky Mountains without having bought them. To-day, the\r\nAmerican people have grown accustomed to the idea of having the\r\nresources of the public domain saved and conserved for the benefit of\r\nthe millions rather than lavished upon a favored few. To-day it is\r\nperfectly safe to talk about making every national forest a first class\r\nwild-life sanctuary, and it is up to the People to request Congress to\r\ntake that action, at once.\r\n\r\nThe Weeks bill, the Anthony bill, and the McLean bill now before\r\nCongress to provide federal protection for migratory birds are\r\npractically identical. All three are good bills; and it matters not\r\nwhich one finally becomes a law. Whichever is put forward finally for\r\npassage should provide federal protection for _all_ migratory birds that\r\never enter the United States, Alaska, or Porto Rico. Why favor the duck\r\nand leave the robin to its fate, or vice versa? It will be just as easy\r\nto do this task by wholes as by halves. The time to hesitate, to feel\r\ntimid, or to be afraid of the other fellow has gone by. To-day the\r\nmillions of honest and serious-minded Americans are ready to back the\r\nmost thorough and most drastic policy, because that has become the most\r\nnecessary and the best policy. Furthermore, it is the only policy worthy\r\nof serious consideration.\r\n\r\nSome of our states have done rather well in wild-life\r\nprotection,--considering the absurdity of our national policy as a\r\nwhole; others have done indifferently, and some have been and still are\r\nvery remiss. Here is where we intend to hew to the line, and without\r\nfear or favor set forth the standing of each state according to its\r\nmerits or its lack of merits. In a life-or-death matter such as now\r\nconfronts us regarding the wild life of our country, it is time to speak\r\nplainly.\r\n\r\nIn the following call of the States, the glaring deficiencies in state\r\ngame laws will be set forth in detail, in order that the sore spots may\r\nbe exposed to the view of the doctors. Conditions will be represented\r\n_as they exist at the end of the summer of 1912_, and it is to be hoped\r\nthat these faults soon may be corrected.\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nA ROLL-CALL OF THE STATES\r\n\r\n\r\nALABAMA:\r\n\r\nIt is a satisfaction to be able to open this list with the name of a\r\nstate that is entitled to a medal of honor for game protection. In this\r\nparticular field of progress and enlightenment, the state of Alabama is\r\nthe pioneer state of the South. New York now occupies a similar position\r\nin the North; but New York is an older state, and stronger in her\r\ngeneral love of nature. The attainment of advanced protection in any\r\nsouthern state is a very different matter from what it is in the North.\r\n\r\nFive years ago Alabama set her house in order. The slaughter of song and\r\ninsectivorous birds has been so far stopped as any Southern state can\r\nstop it unaided by the federal government, and those birds are\r\nrecognized and treated as the farmers' best friends. The absurd system\r\nof attempted protection through county laws has been abandoned. The sale\r\nof game has been stopped, and since that stoppage, quail have increased.\r\nThe trapping and export of game have ceased, and wild turkeys and\r\nwoodcock are now increasing. It is unlawful to kill or capture non-game\r\nbirds. Bag limits have been imposed, but _the bag limit laws are all too\r\nliberal, and should be reduced_. A hunter's license law is in force, and\r\nthe department of game and fish is self-supporting. Night hunting is\r\nprohibited, and female deer may not be killed. A comprehensive warden\r\nsystem has been provided. As yet, however, Alabama\r\n\r\n  Permits the shooting of waterfowl to March 15, which is too late, by\r\n  one and one-half months.\r\n\r\n  The use of automatic and pump guns in hunting should be suppressed.\r\n\r\n  There should be a limit of two deer per year, and killing should be\r\n  restricted to deer with horns not less than three inches long.\r\n\r\nThe story of game protection in Alabama began in 1907. Prior to that\r\ntime, the slaughter of wild life was very great. It is known that\r\nenormous numbers of quail were annually killed by negro farm hands, who\r\nhunted at least three days each week, regardless of work to be done. The\r\nslaughter of quail, wild ducks, woodcock, doves, robins and snipe was\r\ndescribed as \"nauseating.\"\r\n\r\nThe change that has been wrought since 1907 is chiefly due to the\r\nefforts of one man. Alabama owes her standing to-day to the admirable\r\nqualities of John H. Wallace, Jr., her Game and Fish Commissioner,\r\nauthor of the State's policy in wild-life conservation. His\r\nbroad-mindedness, his judgment and his success make him a living object\r\nlesson of the power of one determined man in the conservation of wild\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nCommissioner Wallace is an ardent supporter of the Weeks and Anthony\r\nbills for federal protection, and as a lawyer of the South, he believes\r\nthere is \"no constitutional inhibition against federal legislation for\r\nthe protection of birds of passage.\"\r\n\r\nALASKA:\r\n\r\n  The sale of game must be absolutely prohibited, forever.\r\n\r\n  The slaughter of big game by Indians, miners and prospectors should\r\n  now be limited, and strictly regulated by law, on rational lines.\r\n\r\n  The slaughter of walrus for ivory and hides, both in the Alaskan and\r\n  Russian waters of Bering Sea, should be totally prohibited for ten\r\n  years.\r\n\r\n  The game-warden service should be quadrupled in number of wardens,\r\n  and in general effectiveness.\r\n\r\n  The game-warden service should be supplied with two sea-going\r\n  vessels, independent for patrol work.\r\n\r\n  The bag limit on hoofed game is 50 per cent too large.\r\n\r\n  To accomplish these ends, Congress should annually appropriate\r\n  $50,000 for the protection of wild life in Alaska. The present\r\n  amount, $15,000, is very inadequate, and the great wild-life\r\n  interests at stake amply justify the larger amount.\r\n\r\nIt is now time for Alaska to make substantial advances in the protection\r\nof her wild life. It is no longer right nor just for Indians, miners and\r\nprospectors to be permitted by law to kill all the big game they please,\r\nwhenever they please. The indolent and often extortionate Indians of\r\nAlaska,--who now demand \"big money\" for every service they perform,--are\r\nnot so valuable as citizens that they should be permitted to feed\r\nriotously upon _moose, and cow moose at that_, until that species is\r\nexterminated. Miners and prospectors are valuable citizens, but that is\r\nno reason why they should forever be allowed to live upon wild game, any\r\nmore than that hungry prospectors in our Rocky Mountains should be\r\nallowed to kill cattle.\r\n\r\nAlaska and its resources do not belong to the very few people from \"the\r\nStates\" who have gone there to make their fortunes and get out again as\r\nquickly as possible. The quicker the public mind north of Wrangel is\r\ndisabused of that idea, the better. Its game belongs to the people of\r\nthis nation of ninety-odd millions, and it is a safe prediction that the\r\nninety millions will not continue to be willing that the miners,\r\nprospectors and Indians shall continue to live on moose meat and caribou\r\ntongues in order to save bacon and beef.\r\n\r\nMr. Frank E. Kleinschmidt said to me that at Sand Point, Alaska, he saw\r\neighty-two caribou tongues brought in by an Indian, and sold at fifty\r\ncents each, while (according to all accounts) most of the bodies of the\r\nslaughtered animals became a loss.\r\n\r\nGovernor Clark has recommended in his annual report for 1911 that the\r\nprotection now enjoyed by the giant brown bear _(Ursus middendorffi_) on\r\nKadiak Island be removed, for the benefit of settlers _and their stock_!\r\nIt goes without saying that no one proposes that predatory wild animals\r\nshall be permitted to retard the development of any wild country that is\r\nrequired by civilized man. All we ask in this matter is that, as in the\r\ncase of the once-proposed slaughter of sea-lions on the Pacific Coast,\r\n_the necessity of the proposed slaughter shall be fully and adequately\r\nproven before the killing begins_! It is fair to insist that the\r\nsea-lion episode shall not be repeated on Kadiak Island.\r\n\r\nThe big game of Alaska can not long endure against a \"limit\" of two\r\nmoose, three mountain sheep, three caribou and six deer per year, per\r\nman. At that rate the moose and sheep soon will disappear. The limit\r\nshould be one moose, two sheep, two caribou and four deer,--unless we\r\nare willing to dedicate the Alaskan big game to Commercialism. No\r\nsportsman needs a larger bag than the revised schedule; and\r\ncommercialists should not be allowed to kill big game anywhere, at any\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nLet us bear in mind the fact that Alaska is being throughly \"opened up\"\r\nto the Man with a Gun. Here is the latest evidence, from the new\r\ncircular of an outfitter:\r\n\r\n\"I will have plenty of good horses, and good, competent and courteous\r\nguides; also other camp attendants if desired. My intention is to\r\nestablish permanently at that point, as I believe it is the gateway to\r\nthe finest _and about the last_ of the great game countries of North\r\nAmerica.\"\r\n\r\nThe road is open; the pack-train is ready; the guides are waiting. Go on\r\nand slay the Remnant!\r\n\r\nARIZONA:\r\n\r\n  The band-tailed pigeons and all non-game birds should immediately be\r\n  given protection; and a salaried warden system should be established\r\n  under a Commissioner whose term is not less than four years.\r\n\r\n  The use of automatic and pump guns, in hunting, should be\r\n  prohibited.\r\n\r\n  Spring shooting should be prohibited.\r\n\r\nArizona has good reason to be proud of her up-to-date position in the\r\nranks of the best game-protecting states. No other state or territory of\r\nher age ever has made so good a showing of protective laws. The\r\nenactment of laws to cover the points mentioned above would leave little\r\nto be desired in Arizona. That state has a bird fauna well worth\r\nprotecting, and game wardens are extremely necessary.\r\n\r\nARKANSAS:\r\n\r\n  The enforcement of game laws should be placed in charge of a\r\n  salaried commissioner.\r\n\r\n  Spring shooting of wildfowl should be stopped at once.\r\n\r\n  A reasonable close season should be provided for water fowl, and\r\n  swans should be protected throughout the year.\r\n\r\n  A bag-limit law should be enacted.\r\n\r\n  A force of game wardens, salaried and unsalaried, should at once be\r\n  created.\r\n\r\n  The killing of female deer and the hounding of deer, should be\r\n  stopped.\r\n\r\n  No buck deer should be shot, unless horns three inches long are seen\r\n  before firing.\r\n\r\n  A hunter's license law is necessary; and the fees should go to the\r\n  support of the game protection department.\r\n\r\n  The local exemptions in favor of market hunters in Mississippi\r\n  county should be repealed.\r\n\r\nIt appears that in Arkansas the laws for the protection and increase of\r\nwild life are by no means up to the mark. At this moment, Arkansas is\r\nnext to Florida, the rearmost of all our states in wild-life protection.\r\nAwake, Arkansas! Consider the peril that threatens your fauna. The Sunk\r\nLands, in your northeastern corner along the St. Francis River, are the\r\ngreatest wild-fowl refuge anywhere in the Mississippi Valley between the\r\nGulf Coast of Louisiana and the breeding-grounds of Minnesota. A duty to\r\nthe nation devolves upon you, to protect the migratory waterfowl that\r\nvisit your great bird refuge from the automatic and pump guns of the\r\npothunters who shoot for northern markets, and kill all that they can\r\nkill. _Protect those Sunken Lands_! Confer a boon on all the people of\r\nthe Mississippi Valley by making that region a bird refuge in fact as\r\nwell as in name.\r\n\r\nHeretofore, you have permitted hired market gunners from outside your\r\nborders to slaughter the wild-fowl of your Sunk Lands literally by\r\nmillions, and ship them to northern markets, with very little benefit to\r\nyour people. It is time for that slaughter to cease. Don't maintain a\r\nduck and goose shambles in Mississippi County, year after year, as North\r\nCarolina does! Do unto other states as you would have other states do\r\nunto you. _Do not_ be afraid to pass nine good laws in one act. Clear\r\nyour record in the Family of States, and save your fauna before it is\r\ntoo late. It is not fair for you to permit the slaughter of the\r\ninsectivorous birds that are like the blood of life to the farmer and\r\nfruit grower.\r\n\r\nCALIFORNIA:\r\n\r\n  The sale of all wild game should be forever prohibited.\r\n\r\n  The use of automatic and pump shotguns, in hunting, should be\r\n  prohibited.\r\n\r\n  The killing of pigeons and doves as \"game\" and \"food\" should be\r\n  stopped.\r\n\r\n  The sage grouse and every other species of bird threatened with\r\n  extinction should be given ten year close seasons.\r\n\r\n  The mule deer (if any remain) and the Columbian black-tailed deer in\r\n  the southern counties should be accorded a ten-year close season.\r\n\r\n  A large state game preserve should be created immediately, on or\r\n  near Mount Shasta and abundantly stocked with nucleus herds of\r\n  antelope, black-tailed deer, bison and elk.\r\n\r\n  A suitable preserve in the southern part of the state should be set\r\n  aside for the dwarf elk.\r\n\r\nAs game laws are generally regarded, California has on her books a\r\nseries that look rather good to the eye, but which are capable of\r\nconsiderable improvement. All along the line, the birds and quadrupeds\r\nof the Golden State are vanishing! Under that heading, a vigorous\r\nchapter could be written; but space forbids its development here. Just\r\nfancy laws that permit gunning and hunting with dogs, from August until\r\nJanuary--one-half the entire year! Think of the nesting birds that are\r\ndisturbed or killed by dogs and gunners after other birds!\r\n\r\nCalifornia's wild ducks and geese have been slaughtered to an extent\r\nalmost beyond belief. The splendid sage grouse and the sharp-tailed\r\ngrouse are greatly reduced in numbers. Of her hundreds of thousands of\r\nantelope, once the cheapest game in the market, scarcely \"a trace\"\r\nremains. Her mountain sheep and mule deer are almost extinct. Her\r\ngrizzly bears are gone!\r\n\r\nThe most terrible slaughter ever recorded for automatic guns occurred\r\nin Glenn County, Cal., on Feb. 5, 1906, when two men (whose story was\r\npublished in _Outdoor Life_, xvii, p. 371, April, 1906), killed 450\r\ngeese in one day, and actually bagged 218 of them in _one hour_!\r\n\r\nEvery person who has paid attention to game protection on the Pacific\r\ncoast well knows that during the past eight years or more, the work of\r\ngame protection in California has been in a state of frequent turmoil.\r\nAt times the lack of harmony between the State Fish and Game Commission\r\nand the sportsmen of the state has been damaging to the interests of\r\nwild life, and deplorable. In the case of Warden Welch, in Santa Cruz\r\nCounty, pernicious politics came near robbing the state of a splendid\r\nwarden, but the courts finally overthrew the overthrowers of Mr. Welch,\r\nand reinstated him.\r\n\r\nThe fish and game commissioners of any state should be broad-minded,\r\nnon-partisan, strictly honest and sincere. So long as they possess these\r\nqualities, they deserve and should have the earnest and aggressive\r\nsupport of all sportsmen and all lovers of wild life. The remnant of\r\nwild life is entitled to a square deal, and harmony in the camp of its\r\nfriends. Fortunately California has an excellent force of salaried game\r\nwardens (82 in all) and 577 volunteer wardens serving without salary.\r\n\r\nCOLORADO:\r\n\r\n  The State of Colorado should instantly stop the sale of native wild\r\n  game to be used as food.\r\n\r\n  It should stop all late winter and spring shooting of native wild\r\n  birds.\r\n\r\n  It should give the sage grouse, pinnated grouse and all shore birds\r\n  a ten year close season, remove the dove from the list of game\r\n  birds, and give it a permanent close season.\r\n\r\n  It should remove the crane and the swan from the list of game birds.\r\n\r\nIn twenty-five short years we have seen in Colorado a waste of wild life\r\nand the destruction of a living inheritance that has few parallels in\r\nhistory. Possibly the people of Colorado are satisfied with the\r\nresiduum; but some outsiders regard all Rocky Mountain shambles with a\r\nfeeling of horror.\r\n\r\nA brief quarter-century ago, Colorado was a zoological park of grand\r\nscenery and big game. The scenery remains, but of the great wild herds,\r\nonly samples are left, and of some species not even that.\r\n\r\nThe last bison of Colorado were exterminated in Lost Park by scoundrels\r\ncalling themselves \"taxidermists,\" in 1897. Of the 200,000 mule deer\r\nthat inhabited Routt County and other portions of Colorado, not enough\r\nnow remain to make deer hunting interesting. A perpetual close season\r\nwas put on mountain sheep just in time to save a dozen small flocks as\r\nseed stock. Those flocks have been permitted to live, and they have bred\r\nuntil now there are perhaps 3,500 sheep in the state. Of elk, only a\r\nremnant is left, now protected for fifteen years.\r\n\r\nThe grizzly bear is so thoroughly gone that one is seen only by a rare\r\naccident; but black bears and pumas are sufficiently numerous to afford\r\nfair sport, provided the hunter has a fine outfit of dogs, horses and\r\nguides. Of prong-horned antelope, several bands remain, but it is\r\nreported that they are steadily diminishing. The herds and herders of\r\ndomestic sheep are blamed for the decrease, and I have no doubt they\r\ndeserve it. The sheep and their champions are the implacable enemies of\r\nall wild game, and before them the game vanishes, everywhere.\r\n\r\nThe lawmakers of Colorado have tried hard to provide adequate statutes\r\nfor the protection of the wild life of the state. In fact, I think that\r\nno state has put forth greater or more elaborate efforts in that\r\ndirection. For example, in 1899, under the leadership of Judge D.C.\r\nBeaman of Denver, Colorado initiated the \"more game movement,\" by\r\nenacting a very elaborate law providing for the establishment of private\r\ngame preserves and farms for the breeding of game under state license,\r\nand the tagging and sale of preserve-bred game under state supervision.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BAND-TAILED PIGEON\r\nOften Mistaken for the Passenger Pigeon. The rapid Slaughter\r\nof this Species has Alarmed the Ornithologists of California,\r\nwho now fear its Extinction]\r\n\r\nThe history of game destruction in Colorado is a repetition of the old,\r\nold story,--plenty of laws, but a hundred times too many hunters,\r\nkilling the game both according to law and contrary to it, and doing it\r\nfive times as fast as the game could breed. That combination can safely\r\nbe warranted to wipe out the wild life of any country in the world, and\r\naccomplish it right swiftly.\r\n\r\nAs a big-game country, Colorado is distinctly out of the running. Her\r\npeople are too lawless, and her frontiersmen are, in the main, far too\r\nselfish to look upon plenteous game without going after it. Some of\r\nthese days, a new call of the wild will arise in Colorado, demanding an\r\nopen season on mountain sheep. Those who demand it will say, \"What harm\r\nwill it do to kill a few surplus bucks? It will improve the breed, and\r\nmake the herds increase faster!\"\r\n\r\nBy all means, have an \"open season\" on the Colorado big-horn and the\r\nBritish Columbia elk. It will \"do them good.\" The excitement of ram\r\nslaughter will be good for the females, will it not? Of course, they\r\nwill breed faster after that,--with all the big rams dead. Any \"surplus\"\r\nwild life is a public nuisance, and should promptly be shot to pieces.\r\n\r\nIn Colorado there is some desire that Estes Park should be acquired as a\r\nnational park, and maintained by the government; but the strong reasons\r\nfor this have not yet appeared. As yet we have not heard any reason why\r\nthe State of Colorado should not herself take it and make of it a state\r\npark and game preserve. If done, it could be offered as a partial\r\natonement for her wastefulness in throwing away her inheritance of grand\r\ngame.\r\n\r\nColorado has work to do in the preservation of her remnant of bird life.\r\nIn several respects she is behind the times. The present is no time to\r\nhesitate, or to ask the gunners what _they_ wish to have done about new\r\nlaws for the saving of the remnant of game. The dictates of common sense\r\nare plain, and inexorable. Let the lawmakers do their whole duty by the\r\nremnant of wild life, whether the game killers like it or not.\r\n\r\n_The Curse of Domestic Sheep Upon Game and Cattle_.--Much has been said\r\nin print and out of print regarding the extent to which domestic sheep\r\nhave destroyed the cattle ranges and incidentally many game ranges of\r\nthe West; but the half hath not been told. The American people as a\r\nwhole do not realize that the domestic sheep has driven the domestic\r\nsteer from the free grass of the wild West, with the same speed and\r\nthoroughness with which the buffalo-hunters of the 70's and 80's swept\r\naway the bison. I have seen hundreds of thousands of acres of what once\r\nwere beautiful and fertile cattle-grazing lands in Montana, that has\r\nbeen left by grazing sheep herds looking precisely as if the ground had\r\nbeen shaven with razors and then sandpapered. The sheep have driven out\r\nthe cattle, and the price of beef has gone up accordingly. Neither\r\ncattle, horses nor wild game can find food on ground that has been\r\ngrazed over by sheep.\r\n\r\nThe following is the testimony of a reliable eye witness, Mr. Dillon\r\nWallace, and the full text appears in his book, \"_Saddle and Camp in the\r\nRockies_,\" (page 169):--\r\n\r\n  Domestic sheep and sheep herders are the greatest enemies of the\r\n  antelope, as well as of other game animals and birds in the regions\r\n  where herders take their flocks. The ranges over which domestic\r\n  sheep pasture are denuded of forage and stripped of all growth, and\r\n  antelope will not remain upon a range where sheep have been.\r\n\r\n  Thus the sheep, sweeping clean all before them and leaving the\r\n  ranges over which they pass unproductive, for several succeeding\r\n  seasons, of pasturage for either wild or domestic animals, together\r\n  with the destructive shepherds, are the worst enemies at present of\r\n  Utah's wild game, particularly of antelope, sage hens, and grouse.\r\n\r\n  In Iron county, which has already become an extensive sheep region,\r\n  settlers tell us that before the advent of sheep, grass grew so\r\n  luxuriously that a yearling calf lying in it could not be seen. Not\r\n  only has the grass here been eaten, but the roots tramped out and\r\n  killed by the hoofs of thousands upon thousands of sheep, and now\r\n  wide areas, where not long since grass was so plentiful, are as bare\r\n  and desolate as sand-piles.\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\nNEW LAWS NEEDED IN THE STATES\r\n(Continued)\r\n\r\nCONNECTICUT:\r\n\r\n  The sale of all native wild game, regardless of its source, should\r\n  be prohibited at all times. Enact at once a five-year close season\r\n  law on the remnant of ruffed grouse, quail, woodcock, snipe, and all\r\n  shore birds.\r\n\r\n  Even in the home of the newest and deadliest \"autoloading\" shotgun,\r\n  those guns and pump guns should be prohibited in hunting.\r\n\r\n  The enormous bag limits of 35 rail and 50 each per day of plover,\r\n  snipe and shore birds is a crime! They should be replaced by a\r\n  ten-year close season law for all of those species.\r\n\r\n  The terms of the game commissioners should be not less than four\r\n  years.\r\n\r\nLike so many other states, Connecticut has recklessly wasted her\r\nwild-life inheritance. During the fifteen years preceding the year 1898,\r\nthe bird life of that state had decreased 75 per cent. On March 6, 1912,\r\nSenator Geo. P. McLean, of Connecticut stated at the hearing held by his\r\nCommittee on Forest Reservations and the Protection of Game this fact:\r\n\"We have more cover than there was thirty or forty years ago, more brush\r\nprobably, but there is not one partridge [ruffed grouse] today where\r\nthere were twenty ten years ago!\"\r\n\r\nFirst of all, Connecticut needs a ten-year close season law to save her\r\nremnant of shore birds before it is completely annihilated. Then she\r\nneeds a Bayne law, and needs it badly. Under such a law, and the tagging\r\nsystem that it provides, the state game wardens would have so strong a\r\ngrip on the situation that the present unlawful sale of game would be\r\ncompletely stopped. Half-way measures in preventing the sale of game\r\nwill not answer. Already Connecticut has wasted thousands of dollars in\r\nfruitless efforts to restock her desolated woodlands and farms with\r\nquail, and to introduce the Hungarian partridge; but even yet she _will\r\nnot_ protect her own native species!\r\n\r\nMen of Connecticut, save the last remnants of your native game birds\r\nbefore they are all utterly exterminated within your borders! Don't ask\r\nthe killers of game what _they_ will agree to, but make the laws what\r\n_you know_ they should be! If you want a gameless state, let the\r\ndestruction go on as it now is going, with _16,000 licensed gunners_ in\r\nthe field each year, and you will surely have it, right soon.\r\n\r\n\r\nDELAWARE:\r\n\r\n  Stop all spring shooting, at once; stop killing shore birds for ten\r\n  years, and protect swans indefinitely.\r\n\r\n  Enact bag-limit laws, in very small figures.\r\n\r\n  Stop the sale of all native wild game, regardless of its use, by\r\n  enacting a Bayne law.\r\n\r\n  Enact a resident license law, and provide for a force of paid game\r\n  wardens.\r\n\r\n  Stop the use of machine shot-guns in killing your birds.\r\n\r\nThe state of Delaware is nearly twenty years behind the times. Can it be\r\npossible that her Governor and her people are really satisfied with that\r\nposition? We think not. I dare say they are afflicted with apathy, and\r\ngame-hogs. The latter can easily back up General Apathy to an extent\r\nthat spells \"no game laws.\" In one act, and at one bold stroke, Delaware\r\ncan step out of her position at the rear of the procession of states,\r\nand take a place in the front rank. Will she do it? We hope so, for her\r\npresent status is unworthy of any right-minded, red-blooded state this\r\nside of the Philippines.\r\n\r\nDISTRICT OF COLUMBIA:\r\n\r\n  The sale of all native wild game, regardless of its source, should\r\n  be stopped immediately, by the enactment of a complete Bayne law.\r\n\r\n  If game-shooting within the District is continued, on the marshes of\r\n  the Eastern Branch and on the Potomac River, common decency demands\r\n  the enactment of bag-limit laws and long close-season laws of the\r\n  most modern pattern.\r\n\r\nJust why it is that gross abuses against wild life have so long been\r\ntolerated in the territorial center of the American nation, remains to\r\nbe ascertained. But, whatever the reason the situation is absurd and\r\nintolerable, and Congress should terminate it immediately. As late as\r\n1897, and I think for two or three years thereafter, thousands of\r\n_robins_ were sold every year in the public markets of Washington as\r\nfood! As a spectacle for gods and men, behold to-day the sale of quail,\r\nruffed grouse, wild turkeys and other American game, half way between\r\nthe Capitol and the White House! Look at Center Market as a national\r\n\"fence\" for the sale of game stolen by market gunners from Maryland,\r\nVirginia, the Carolinas and Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nIt is time for Congress to bring the District of Columbia sharply into\r\nline; for Washington must be made to toe the mark beside New York. The\r\nreputation of the national capital demands it, whether the gods of the\r\ncafes will consent or not.\r\n\r\nFLORIDA:\r\n\r\n  Shooting shore birds and waterfowl in late winter and spring should\r\n  be stopped.\r\n\r\n  The sale of all native wild game should be prohibited.\r\n\r\n  A State Game Commissioner whose term of office should be not less\r\n  than four years, and a force of salaried game wardens, should be\r\n  appointed.\r\n\r\n  A general resident license should be required for hunting.\r\n\r\n  The killing of does and fawns should be stopped, and no deer should\r\n  be killed save bucks with horns at least three inches long.\r\n\r\n  The bag limit of five deer per year should be two deer; of twenty\r\n  quail, and two turkeys per day should be ten quail and one turkey.\r\n\r\n  The open season on all game birds should end on February 1, for\r\n  domestic reasons.\r\n\r\n  Protection should be accorded doves, and robins should be removed\r\n  from the game list.\r\n\r\nIn the destruction of wild life, I think the backwoods population of\r\nFlorida is the most lawless and defiant that can be found anywhere in\r\nthe United States. The \"plume-hunters\" have practically exterminated the\r\nplume-bearing egrets, wholly annihilated the roseate spoonbill, the\r\nflamingo, and also the Carolina parrakeet. On July 8, 1905, one of them\r\nkilled an Audubon Association Warden, Guy M. Bradley, whose business it\r\nwas to enforce the state laws protecting the egret rookeries. The people\r\nreally to blame for the shooting of Guy Bradley, and the extermination\r\nof the egrets by lawless and dangerous men, are the vain and merciless\r\nwomen who wear the \"white badges of cruelty\" as long as they can be\r\npurchased! They have much to answer for!\r\n\r\nOriginally, Florida was alive with bird life. For number of species,\r\nabundance of individuals, and general dispersal throughout the whole\r\nstate, I think no other state in America except possibly California ever\r\npossessed a bird fauna quite comparable with it. Once its bird life was\r\none of the wonders of America. But the gunners began early to shoot, and\r\nshoot, and shoot. During the fifteen years preceding 1898, the general\r\nbird life of Florida decreased in volume 77 per cent. In 1900 it was at\r\na very low point, and it has steadily continued to decrease. The\r\nrapidly-growing settlement and cultivation of the state has of course\r\nhad much to do with the disappearance of wild life generally, and the\r\ndraining and exploitation of the Everglades will about finish the birds\r\nof southern Florida.\r\n\r\nThe brown pelicans' breeding-place on Pelican Island, in Indian River,\r\nhas been taken in hand by the national government as a bird refuge, and\r\nits marvelous spectacle of pelican life is now protected. Nine other\r\nislands on the coast of Florida have been taken as national bird\r\nrefuges, and will render posterity good service.\r\n\r\nThe great private game and bird preserve of Dr. Ray V. Pierce, at\r\nApalachicola, known as St. Vincent Island, containing twenty square\r\nmiles of wonderful woods and waters, is performing an important function\r\nfor the state and the nation.\r\n\r\nThe Florida bag limit on quail is entirely too liberal. I know one man\r\nwho never once exceeded the limit of twenty birds per day, but in the\r\nseason of 1908-9 he killed _865 quail_! Can the quail of any state long\r\nendure such drains as that?\r\n\r\nFrom a zoological point of view, Florida is in bad shape. A great many\r\nof her people who shoot are desperately lawless and uncontrollable, and\r\nthe state is not financially able to support a force of wardens\r\nsufficiently strong to enforce the laws, even as they are. It looks as\r\nif the slaughter would go on until nothing of bird life remains. At\r\npresent I can see no hope whatever for saving even a good remnant of the\r\nwild life of the state.\r\n\r\nThe present status of wild-life protective laws in Florida was made the\r\nsubject of an article in _Forest and Stream_ of August 10, 1912, by John\r\nH. Wallace, Jr., Game Commissioner of the State of Alabama, in an\r\narticle entitled \"The Florida Situation.\" In view of his record, no one\r\nwill question either the value or the honest sincerity of Mr. Wallace's\r\nopinions. The following paragraphs are from that article:\r\n\r\n  The enactment of a model and modern game law for the State of\r\n  Florida is absolutely imperative in order to save many of the most\r\n  valuable species of birds and game of that State from certain\r\n  depletion and threatened extinction. The question of the protection\r\n  of the birds and game in Florida is not a local one, but is national\r\n  in its scope. Birds know no state lines, and while practically all\r\n  the States lying to the north of Florida protect migratory birds and\r\n  waterfowl, yet these are recklessly slaughtered in that state to\r\n  such an extent as to be appalling to all sportsmen and bird lovers.\r\n\r\n  So alarming has become the decrease of the birds and game of Florida\r\n  that unless a halt is called on the campaign of reckless\r\n  annihilation that has been ceaselessly waged in that state, the\r\n  sport and recreation enjoyed by primeval nimrods will linger only in\r\n  history and tradition.\r\n\r\n  It is the sincerest hope of all lovers of wild life of the American\r\n  continent that a strong and invincible sentiment, relative to the\r\n  imperative necessity of real conservation legislation, be\r\n  crystallized in the minds of the members elect of the Florida\r\n  Legislature, to the end that the next Legislature will spread upon\r\n  the statute books of the State of Florida a model and modern law for\r\n  the preservation and protection of the birds and game of that State,\r\n  which when put into practical operation will elicit the thanks of\r\n  all good citizens, and likewise the gratitude of future generations.\r\n\r\nGEORGIA:\r\n\r\n  Prohibit late winter and spring shooting, and provide rational\r\n  seasons for wild fowl.\r\n\r\n  Reduce the limit on deer to two bucks a season, with horns not less\r\n  than three inches long.\r\n\r\n  Protect the meadow lark and stop forever the killing of doves and\r\n  wood-ducks.\r\n\r\n  Prohibit the use of automatic and pump shot-guns in hunting.\r\n\r\n  Extend the term of the game commissioner to four years.\r\n\r\nWe are glad to report that Georgia has already begun to take up the\r\nwhite man's burden. The protection of wild life is now a gentleman's\r\nproposition, and in it every real man with red blood in his veins has a\r\nduty to perform. The state of Georgia has recently awakened, and under\r\nthe comprehensive law of 1911 has resolutely undertaken to do her whole\r\nduty in this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\nIDAHO:\r\n\r\nThe imperative duties of Idaho are as follows:\r\n\r\n  Stop all hunting of mountain sheep, mountain goat and elk.\r\n\r\n  Give the sage grouse and sharp-tail ten-year close seasons, at once,\r\n  to forestall their extermination.\r\n\r\n  Stop the killing of doves as \"game.\"\r\n\r\n  Stop the killing of female deer, and of bucks with horns less than\r\n  three inches long.\r\n\r\n  Enact the model law to protect non-game birds.\r\n\r\n  Prohibit the use of machine shot-guns in hunting.\r\n\r\n  Extend the State Warden's term to four years.\r\n\r\nLike Montana, Wyoming and Colorado, the state of Idaho has wasted her\r\nstock of game, and it is to be feared that several species are now about\r\nto disappear from that state. I am told that the sage grouse is almost\r\n\"gone\"; and I think that the antelope, caribou, and mountain sheep are\r\nin the same condition of scarcity.\r\n\r\nIf the people of Idaho wish to save their wild fauna, they must be up\r\nand doing. The time to temporize, theorize, be conservative and\r\neasy-going has gone by. It is that fatal policy that causes men to\r\nslumber until it is too late to act; and we will watch with keen\r\ninterest to see whether the real men of Idaho are big enough to do their\r\nwhole duty in time to benefit their state.\r\n\r\nIn 1910, Dr. T.S. Palmer credited Idaho with the possession of about\r\nfive hundred moose and two hundred antelope.\r\n\r\nThere is one feature of the Idaho game law that may well stand\r\nunchanged. The open season on \"ibex,\" of which one per year may be\r\nkilled, may as well be continued. One myth per year is not an\r\nextravagant bag for any intelligent hunter; and it seems that the \"ibex\"\r\nwill not down. Being officially recognized by Idaho, its place in our\r\nfauna now seems assured.\r\n\r\nILLINOIS:\r\n\r\n  Enact a Bayne law, and stop the sale of all native wild game,\r\n  regardless of source, and regardless of the gay revelers of Chicago.\r\n\r\n  In Illinois the bag limits on birds are nearly all at least 50 per\r\n  cent too high. They should be as follows: No squirrels, doves or\r\n  shore birds; six quail, five woodcock, ten coots, ten rail, ten\r\n  ducks, three geese and three brant, with a total limit of ten\r\n  waterfowl per day.\r\n\r\n  Doves should be removed from the game list.\r\n\r\n  All tree squirrels and chipmunks should be perpetually protected, as\r\n  companions to man, unfit for food.\r\n\r\n  The sale of aigrettes should be stopped, and Chicago placed in the\r\n  same class as Boston, New York, New Orleans and San Francisco.\r\n\r\n  The use of all machine shotguns in hunting should be prohibited.\r\n\r\nThe chief plague-spots for the grinding up of American game are Chicago,\r\nPhiladelphia, Baltimore, New Orleans and San Francisco. St. Louis\r\ncleared her record in 1909. New York thoroughly cleaned her Augean\r\nstable in 1911, and Massachusetts won her Bayne law by a desperate\r\nbattle in 1912. In 1913, Pennsylvania probably will enact a Bayne law.\r\n\r\nFancy a city in the center of the United States sending to Norway for\r\n1,500 ptarmigan, to eat, as Chicago did in 1911; and that was only one\r\norder.\r\n\r\nFor forty years the marshes, prairies, farms and streams of the whole\r\nupper Mississippi Valley have been combed year after year by the guns of\r\nthe market shooters. Often the migratory game was located by telegraphic\r\nreports. Game birds were slain by the wagon-load, boat-load, barrel, and\r\ncar-load, \"for the Chicago market.\" And the fool farmers of the Middle\r\nWest stolidly plowed their fields and fed their hogs, and permitted the\r\nslaughter to go on. To-day the sons of those farmers go to the museums\r\nand zoological parks of the cities to see specimens of pinnated grouse,\r\ncrane, woodcock, ducks and other species that the market shooters have\r\n\"wiped out\"; and their fathers wax eloquent in telling of the flocks of\r\npigeons that \"darkened the sky,\" and the big droves of prairie chickens\r\nthat used to rise out of the corn-fields \"with a roar like a coming\r\nstorm.\"\r\n\r\nTo-day, Chicago stands half-way reformed. Her markets are open to only\r\none-half the game killable in Illinois, but they are wide open to all\r\n\"_legally_ killed game imported from other states, from Oct. 1 to Feb.\r\n1.\" Through that hole in her game laws any game-dealer can drive a\r\nmoving-van! Of course, any game offered in Chicago has been \"legally\r\nkilled in some other state!\" Who can prove otherwise?\r\n\r\nIn addition to the imported game illegally killed in other states, the\r\nstarving population of Chicago may also buy for cash, and consume with\r\ntheir champagne in November and December, all the Illinois doves that\r\ncan be combed out by the market-gunners.\r\n\r\nAfter the awful Iroquois Theatre fire in Chicago, in 1903, the game\r\ndealers reported a heavy falling off in the consumption of game! The\r\ntragedy caused the temporary closing of the theaters, and the falling\r\noff in after-theater suppers may be said to have taken away the\r\nappetites of thousands of erstwhile consumers of game. Incidentally it\r\nshowed who consumes purchased game.\r\n\r\nThe people of Illinois should now enact a full-fledged Bayne law,\r\nwithout changing a single word, and bring Chicago up to the level of New\r\nYork, St. Louis and Boston.\r\n\r\nThe present bag limits on Illinois game birds are fatally high. As they\r\nstand, with 190,000 licensed gunners in the field each year, what else\r\ndo they mean than extermination? The men of Illinois have just two\r\nalternatives between which to choose: drastic and immediate\r\npreservation, or a gameless state. Which shall it be?\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIANA:\r\n\r\n  Indiana should hasten to stop spring shooting.\r\n\r\n  She should enact a law, prohibiting the sale for millinery purposes\r\n  of the plumage of all wild birds save ducks killed in their open\r\n  season.\r\n\r\n  A Bayne law, absolutely prohibiting the sale of all native wild\r\n  game, should be enacted at once.\r\n\r\n  The killing of squirrels should be prohibited; because they are not\r\n  white men's game.\r\n\r\n  Ruffed grouse and quail should have five year close seasons.\r\n\r\n  The use of pump and autoloading guns in hunting should be\r\n  prohibited.\r\n\r\nIn Indiana the white-tailed deer is extinct. This means very close\r\nhunting, and a bad outlook for all other game larger than the sparrow.\r\nOn October 2, 1912, eleven heads of greater bird of paradise, with\r\nplumes attached, were offered for sale within one hundred feet of the\r\nheadquarters of the Fourth National Conservation Congress. The prices\r\nranged from $35 to $47.50; and while we looked, two ladies came up, one\r\nof whom pointed to a bird-of-paradise corpse and said: \"There! I want\r\none o' them, an' I'm a-goin' to _have_ it, too!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIOWA:\r\n\r\n  Spring shooting should be stopped, at once and forever.\r\n\r\n  The killing of all tree squirrels and chipmunks should cease.\r\n\r\n  All shore birds that visit Iowa deserve a five-year close season.\r\n\r\n  Especially is the shooting of plover, sandpiper, marsh and beach\r\n  birds, rail, duck, geese and brant from September 1, to April 15, an\r\n  outrage.\r\n\r\n  Iowa should prohibit the use of the machine guns, and it is to be\r\n  hoped that she will awaken sufficiently to do so.\r\n\r\nIt is said that the Indian word \"Iowa\" means \"the drowsy, or sleepy\r\nones.\" Politically, and educationally, Iowa is all right, but in the\r\nprotection of wild life she is ten years behind the times, in almost\r\neverything save the prohibition of the sale of game. _Iowa knows better\r\nthan to pursue the course that she does_! She boasts about her corn and\r\nhogs, but she is deaf to the appeals of the states surrounding her on\r\nthe subject of spring shooting. For years Minnesota has set her a good\r\nexample; but nothing moves her to step up where she belongs in the\r\nphalanx of intelligent game-protecting states.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing may sound harsh, but in view of what other states have\r\nendured from Iowa's stubbornness regarding migratory game, the time for\r\nsilent treatment of her case has gone by. She is to-day in the same\r\nclass as North Carolina, South Carolina and Maryland,--at the tail end\r\nof the procession of states. She cares everything for corn and hogs, but\r\nlittle for wild life.\r\n\r\n\r\nKANSAS:\r\n\r\n  Spring shooting should be stopped, at once: with apologies for not\r\n  having done so long ago.\r\n\r\n  The continued shooting of prairie chickens when the species is near\r\n  extermination is outrageous, and should be prohibited for ten years.\r\n\r\n  Doves should be removed permanently from the game list, partly as a\r\n  measure of self respect.\r\n\r\n  Kansas should treat herself to a force of salaried game wardens\r\n  rendering real service.\r\n\r\n  She should bar out the machine guns as unfit for use in a\r\n  well-regulated State.\r\n\r\nKansas has calmly witnessed the extermination of her bison, elk, deer,\r\nantelope, wild turkeys, sage grouse, whooping cranes, and the beginning\r\nof the end of her pinnated grouse, without a pang. What is wild game in\r\ncomparison with fat hogs, and seventy-bushels-to-the-acre!\r\n\r\nDraw a line around the hog-and-corn area of the United States, and\r\nwithin it you will find more spring shooting, more sale of game and more\r\nextermination of species than in any other area in the United States. I\r\nrefer to Nebraska, Kansas, Iowa, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio,\r\nKentucky and Tennessee. In not one of these states except Missouri is\r\nthere any big game hunting, and in the majority of them spring shooting\r\nis lawful!\r\n\r\nIn the Island of Mauritius, it was swine that exterminated the dodo. In\r\nthe United States, hogs and game extermination still go hand in hand.\r\nSince the days of the dodo, however, a new species of swine has been\r\ndeveloped. It is now widely known as the \"game-hog,\" and it has been\r\nofficially recognized by both bench and bar.\r\n\r\nKENTUCKY:\r\n\r\nNearly everything that a state should maintain in the line of wild life\r\nprotection _Kentucky lacks_! It is easier to tell what she has than to\r\nrecite what she should have. Kentucky _permits spring shooting_; she has\r\n_no bag limits_, and she has _long open seasons_ on everything save\r\nintroduced pheasants; She protects from sale only quail, grouse and wild\r\nturkey _killed within her own borders_. This means that her markets are\r\npractically wide open.\r\n\r\nUntil recently the people of Kentucky have been very indifferent to the\r\nvalue of her wild-life; but with the new law enacted this year providing\r\nfor a game commission and a game protection fund, surely every member of\r\nthe Army of the Defense will wish God-speed to her efforts in game\r\nconservation, and stand ready to lend a helping hand whenever help can\r\nbe utilized.\r\n\r\nKentucky should at one grand coup _stop spring shooting and all sale of\r\nwild game, accord long close seasons to all species that are verging on\r\nextinction, protect doves, establish moderate bag limits and stop the\r\nuse of machine guns_. If she takes up these measures at the rate of only\r\none at each legislative session, by the time her laws are perfect _all\r\nher game will be gone_!\r\n\r\n\r\nLOUISIANA:\r\n\r\nOn more counts than one, Louisiana is in the list of Great Delinquents;\r\nfor behold the things that she needs to do:\r\n\r\n  Protect deer for five years.\r\n\r\n  Instantly take the robin, red-winged black-bird, dove, grosbeak,\r\n  wood-duck and gull off the list of birds that may be killed as\r\n  \"game.\"\r\n\r\n  Stop all late winter and spring shooting.\r\n\r\n  Stop the sale of all native game, and the possession and\r\n  transportation of game sold or intended for sale. In short,\r\n\r\n  Enact a Bayne law.\r\n\r\n  Re-establish a game warden system.\r\n\r\nIn legally permitting the slaughter of the robin, red-winged blackbird,\r\ndove, grosbeak, wood-duck and gull the state of Louisiana is very\r\nculpable.\r\n\r\nFor good reasons, forty states of the American Union strictly prohibit\r\nthe killing of song and insectivorous birds. The duty of every state to\r\nprotect those birds is not a debatable proposition. I put this question\r\nto the people of Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee and\r\nother states where the robin is treated as a game bird: Is it fair of\r\nyou to kill and eat robins when that species is carefully protected by\r\nforty other states of our country for grave economic reasons? What would\r\nyou say of the people of the North if they slaughtered your mockingbird\r\n_to eat_!\r\n\r\nRemember this proportion:\r\n\r\nThe Robin : The North :: The Mockingbird : The South.\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\nNEW LAWS NEEDED IN THE STATES\r\n(Continued)\r\n\r\n\r\nMAINE:\r\n\r\nThere are reasons for the belief that Maine is conserving her large game\r\nbetter than any other state or province in North America. One glance\r\nover her laws is sufficient to convince anyone that instead of studying\r\nthe clamor of her shooting population, Maine has actually been studying\r\nthe needs of her game, and providing for those needs. If all other\r\nstates were doing equally well, the task of writing a book of admonition\r\nwould have been unnecessary. The proof of Maine's alertness is to be\r\nfound in the number of her extra short, or entirely closed, seasons on\r\ngame. For example:\r\n\r\n  Cow and calf moose are permanently protected.\r\n\r\n  Only bull moose, with at least two 3-inch prongs on its horns, may\r\n  be killed.\r\n\r\n  Caribou have had a close season since 1899.\r\n\r\n  On gray and black squirrels, doves and quail, there is no open\r\n  season.\r\n\r\n  The open season for deer varies from ten weeks to four weeks, and in\r\n  parts of three counties there is no open season at all.\r\n\r\n  Silencers are prohibited, and firearms in forests may be prohibited\r\n  by the Governor during droughts.\r\n\r\n  Nearly all wild-fowl shooting ends January 1, but in two places, on\r\n  December 1.\r\n\r\nPeople who have not learned the facts habitually think of Maine as a\r\nvast killing-ground for deer; and it is well for it to be known that the\r\nhunting-grounds have been carefully designated, according to the\r\nabundance or scarcity of game.\r\n\r\nMaine has wisely chosen to regard her hunting-grounds and her deer as a\r\nvaluable asset, and she manages them accordingly. To be a guide in that\r\nstate is to be a good citizen, and a protector of game from illegal\r\nslaughter. No non-resident may hunt without a licensed guide. The\r\nlicenses for the thousands of deer killed in Maine each year, and the\r\nexpenses of the visiting sportsmen who hunt them, annually bring into\r\nthe state and leave there a huge sum of money, variously estimated at\r\nfrom $2,000,000 to $3,000,000. One can only guess at the amount from the\r\nnumber of non-resident licenses issued; but certainly the total can not\r\nbe less than $1,000,000.\r\n\r\nAlthough Mr. L.T. Carleton is no longer chairman of the Commission of\r\nInland Fisheries and Game, the splendid services that he rendered the\r\nstate of Maine during his thirteen years of service, especially in the\r\ncreation of a good code of game laws, constitute an imperishable\r\nmonument to his name and fame.\r\n\r\nThere is very little that Maine needs in the line of new legislation,\r\nor better protection to her game. With the enactment of a resident\r\nlicense law and a five-year close season for woodcock, plover, snipe and\r\nsandpipers, I think her laws for the protection of wild life would be\r\nsufficiently perfect for all practical purposes. The Pine-Tree State is\r\nto be congratulated upon its wise and efficient handling of the\r\nwild-life situation.\r\n\r\nMARYLAND:\r\n\r\nHow has it come to pass that Maryland _lacks_ more good wild-life laws\r\nthan any other state in the Union except North Carolina? Of the really\r\nfundamental protective laws, embracing the list that to every\r\nself-respecting state seems indispensable, Maryland has almost none save\r\ncertain bag-limit laws! Otherwise, the state is wide open! It is indeed\r\nhigh time that she should abandon her present attitude of hostility to\r\nwild life, and become a good neighbor. She should do what is _fair_ and\r\n_right_ about the protection of the migratory game and bird life that\r\nannually passes twice through her territory!\r\n\r\nAt the last session of the Maryland legislature, the law preventing the\r\nuse of power boats in wild-fowl shooting was repealed. That was a step\r\nten years backward; and Maryland should be ashamed of it!\r\n\r\nThe list of things that Maryland must do in order to clear her record is\r\na long one. Here it is:\r\n\r\n  Local regulations should be replaced by a uniform state law.\r\n\r\n  The sale of all native wild game should be stopped.\r\n\r\n  Spring and late winter shooting of game should be stopped.\r\n\r\n  All non-game birds not already included under the statutes should be\r\n  protected.\r\n\r\n  The exportation of all game should be prohibited, unless accompanied\r\n  by the man who shot it, bearing his license, and the law should be\r\n  state-wide instead of depending upon a separate enactment for each\r\n  county.\r\n\r\n  There should be a hunter's license law for all who hunt.\r\n\r\n  The use of machine shotguns in hunting should be stopped, at once.\r\n\r\n  Stop the use of power boats in wild-fowl shooting.\r\n\r\nMASSACHUSETTS:\r\n\r\nIn 1912 the state of Massachusetts moved up into the foremost rank of\r\nstates, where for one year New York had stood alone. She passed a\r\ncounterpart of the New York law, absolutely prohibiting the sale of all\r\nwild American game in Massachusetts, but providing for the sale of game\r\nthat has been reared in preserves and tagged by state officers. This\r\nvictory was achieved only after three months of hard fighting. The\r\ncoalition of sportsmen, zoologists and friends of wild life in general\r\nproved irresistible, just as a similar union of forces accomplished the\r\nBayne law in New York in 1911. The victory is highly instructive, as\r\ngreat victories usually are. It proves once more that whenever the\r\nAmerican people can be aroused from their normal apathy regarding wild\r\nlife, _any good conservation legislation can be enacted!_ The prime\r\nnecessities to success are good measures, good management, a reasonable\r\ncampaign fund, and tireless energy and persistence. Massachusetts is to\r\nbe roundly congratulated on having so thoroughly cleaned up her\r\nsale-of-game situation.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, five bills for the repeal of the Massachusetts law against\r\nspring shooting were introduced, and each one went down to the defeat\r\nthat it deserved. _The repeal of a spring-shooting law, anywhere, is a\r\nstep backward ten years!_\r\n\r\nMassachusetts needs a bag-limit law more in keeping with her small\r\nremnant of wild life; and that she will have ere long. Very soon, also,\r\nher sportsmen will raise the standard of ethics in shotgun shooting, by\r\nbarring out the automatic and pump shotguns so much beloved by the\r\nmarket shooters. As matters stand at this date (1912) the Old Bay State\r\nneeds the following new laws:\r\n\r\n  Low bag limits on all game.\r\n\r\n  Five-year close seasons on all shore birds, snipe and woodcock.\r\n\r\n  Expulsion of the automatic and pump shotguns, in hunting.\r\n\r\nMICHIGAN:\r\n\r\nOn the whole, the game laws of Michigan are in excellent shape, and\r\nleave little to be desired in the line of betterment except to be\r\nsimplified. All the game protected by the laws of the state is debarred\r\nfrom sale; squirrels, pinnated grouse, doves and wild turkeys enjoy long\r\nclose seasons; the bag limits on deer and game birds are reasonably low;\r\nspring shooting still is possible on nine species of ducks; and this\r\nshould be stopped without delay.\r\n\r\nOnly three or four suggestions are in order:\r\n\r\n  All spring shooting should be prohibited.\r\n\r\n  All shore birds should have a five-year close season.\r\n\r\n  The use of the machine shotguns in hunting should be stopped.\r\n\r\n  The laws should permit the sale, under tag, of all species of game\r\n  that can successfully be reared in preserves on a commercial basis.\r\n\r\n  Two or three state game preserves, for deer, each at least four\r\n  miles square, should be established without delay.\r\n\r\nMINNESOTA:\r\n\r\n  This state should at once enact a bag-limit law that will do some\r\n  good, instead of the statutory farce now on the books. Make it\r\n  fifteen birds per day of waterfowl, all species combined, and no\r\n  grouse or quail.\r\n\r\n  There should be five-year close seasons enacted for quail, grouse,\r\n  plover, woodcock, snipe, and all other shore birds.\r\n\r\n  A law should be enacted prohibiting the use of firearms by\r\n  unnaturalized aliens, and a $20 license for all naturalized aliens.\r\n\r\n  Provision should be made for a large state game refuge in southern\r\n  Minnesota.\r\n\r\n  The state should prohibit the use of machine guns in hunting.\r\n\r\nTo-day, direct and reliable advices show that the game situation in\r\nMinnesota is far from encouraging. Several species are threatened with\r\nextinction at an early date. In northern Minnesota it is reported that\r\nmuch game is surreptitiously trapped and slaughtered. The bob white is\r\nreported as threatened with total extinction at an early date; but I\r\nthink the prairie chicken will be the first bird species to go. Moose\r\nwill soon be extinct everywhere in Minnesota except in the game\r\npreserves. Apparently there is now about one duck in Minnesota for every\r\nten ducks that were there only ten years ago.\r\n\r\nNow, what is Minnesota going to do about all this? Is she willing\r\nthrough Apathy to become a gameless state? Her people need to arouse\r\nthemselves _now_, and pass several _strong_ laws. Her bag limit of\r\nforty-five birds _per day_ of quail, grouse, woodcock and plover, and\r\n_fifty_ per day of the waterbirds, is a joke, and nothing more; but it\r\nis no laughing matter. It spells extermination.\r\n\r\nMISSISSIPPI:\r\n\r\n  The legalized slaughter of robins, cedar birds, grosbeaks and doves\r\n  should cease immediately, on the basis of economy of resources and a\r\n  square deal to all the states lying northward of Mississippi.\r\n\r\n  The shooting of all water-fowl should cease on January 1.\r\n\r\n  A reasonable limit should be established on deer.\r\n\r\n  A hunting license law should be passed at once, fixing the fee at $1\r\n  and devoting the revenue to the pay of a corps of non-political game\r\n  wardens, selected on a basis of ability and fitness.\r\n\r\n  The administration of the game laws should be placed in charge of a\r\n  salaried game commissioner.\r\n\r\nIt is seriously to the discredit of Mississippi that her laws actually\r\nclassify robins, cedar-birds, grosbeaks and doves as \"game,\" and _make\r\nthem killable as such from Sept. 1 to March 1!_ I should think that if\r\nno economic consideration carried weight in Mississippi, state pride\r\nalone would be sufficient to promote a correction of the evil. If we of\r\nthe North were to slaughter mockingbirds for food, when they come North\r\nto visit us, the men of the South would call us greedy barbarians; and\r\nthey would be quite right.\r\n\r\nMISSOURI:\r\n\r\n  The Missouri bag limits that permit the killing or possession of\r\n  fifty birds per day are absurd, and fatally liberal. The utmost\r\n  should be twenty-five; and even that is too high.\r\n\r\n  Doves should be taken off the list of game birds, and protected\r\n  throughout the year; and so should all tree squirrels.\r\n\r\n  Spring shooting of shore birds and waterfowl should be prohibited\r\n  without delay.\r\n\r\n  A law against automatic and pump guns should be enacted at the next\r\n  legislative session, as a public lesson on the raising of the\r\n  standard of ethics in shooting.\r\n\r\nThe state of Missouri is really strong in her position as a\r\ngame-protecting state. She perpetually protects such vanishing species\r\nas the ruffed grouse, prairie chicken (pinnated grouse), woodcock, and\r\nall her shore birds save snipe and plover. She prohibits the sale of\r\nnative game and the killing of female deer; but she wisely permits the\r\nsale of preserve-bred elk and deer under the tags of the State Game\r\nCommission. For nearly all the wild game that is accessible, her markets\r\nare tightly closed.\r\n\r\nWe heartily congratulate Missouri on her advanced position on the sale\r\nof game, and we hope that the people of Iowa will even yet profit by her\r\ngood example.\r\n\r\nMONTANA:\r\n\r\nLike Colorado and Wyoming, Montana is wasting a valuable heritage of\r\nwild game while she struggles to maintain the theory that she still is\r\nin the list of states that furnish big-game hunting. It is a fact that\r\nten years ago most sportsmen began to regard Montana as a has-been for\r\nbig game, and began to seek better hunting-grounds elsewhere. British\r\nColumbia, Alberta and Alaska have done much for the game of Montana by\r\ndrawing sportsmen away from it. Mr. Henry Avare, the State Game Warden,\r\nis optimistic regarding even the big game, and believes that it is\r\nholding its own. This is partially true of white-tailed deer, or it was\r\nup to the time of great slaughter. It is said that in 1911, 11,000 deer\r\nwere killed in Montana, all in the western part of the state, seventy\r\nper cent of which were white-tails. The deep snows and extreme cold of a\r\nlong and unusually severe winter drove the hungry deer down out of the\r\nmountains into the settlements, where the ranchmen joyously slaughtered\r\nthem. The destruction around Kalispell was described by Harry P.\r\nStanford as \"sickening.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Avare estimates the prong-horned antelope in Montana at three\r\nthousand head, of which about six hundred are under the quasi-protection\r\nof four ranches.\r\n\r\n  The antelope need three or four small ranges, such as the Snow Creek\r\n  Antelope Range, where the bad lands are too rough for ranchmen, but\r\n  quite right for antelopes and other big game.\r\n\r\n  All the grouse and ptarmigan of Montana need a five-year close\r\n  season. The splendid sage grouse is now extinct in many parts of its\r\n  previous range. Fifty-eight thousand licensed gunners are too many\r\n  for them!\r\n\r\n  The few mountain sheep and mountain goats that survive should have a\r\n  five-year close season, at once.\r\n\r\n  The killing of female hoofed animals should be prohibited by law.\r\n\r\n  Montana has not yet adopted the model law for the protection of\r\n  non-game birds. Only seven states have failed in that respect.\r\n\r\n  The use of automatic and pump shotguns, and silencers, should\r\n  immediately be prohibited.\r\n\r\nMontana's bag-limits are not wholly bad; but the grizzly bear has almost\r\nbeen exterminated, save in the Yellowstone Park. Some of these days, if\r\nthings go on as they are now going, the people of Montana will be rudely\r\nawakened to the fact that they have 50,000 licensed hunters but no\r\nlonger any killable game! And then we will hear enthusiastic talk about\r\n\"restocking.\"\r\n\r\nNEBRASKA:\r\n\r\nNo other state has bestowed close seasons upon as many extinct species\r\nof game as Nebraska. Behold how she has resolutely locked the doors of\r\nher empty cage after all these species have flown: Elk, antelope, wild\r\nturkey, passenger pigeon, whooping crane, sage grouse, ptarmigan and\r\ncurlew. In a short time the pinnated grouse can be added to the list of\r\nhas-beens.\r\n\r\nThere is little to say regarding the future of the game of Nebraska; for\r\nits \"future\" is now history.\r\n\r\n  Provision should be made for one or more state game preserves.\r\n\r\n  Spring shooting of shore birds and waterfowl should be prohibited.\r\n\r\n  A larger and more effective warden service should be provided.\r\n\r\n  Doves should be removed from the game list.\r\n\r\nNEVADA:\r\n\r\n  The sage grouse should be given a ten-year close season, for\r\n  recuperation.\r\n\r\n  All non-game birds should have perpetual protection.\r\n\r\n  The cranes, now verging on extinction, and the pigeons and doves\r\n  should at once be taken out of the list of game birds, and forever\r\n  protected.\r\n\r\n  All the shore birds need five years of close protection.\r\n\r\n  A State Game Warden whose term of office is not less than four years\r\n  should be provided for.\r\n\r\n  A corps of salaried game protectors should be chosen for active and\r\n  aggressive game protection.\r\n\r\n  Nevada's bag limits are among the best of any state, the only\r\n  serious flaw being \"10 sage grouse\" per day: which should be 0!\r\n\r\nNevada still has a few antelope; and _we beg her to protect them all\r\nfrom being hunted or killed!_ It is my belief that if the antelope is\r\nreally saved anywhere in the United States outside of national parks and\r\npreserves, it will be in the wild and remote regions of Nevada, where it\r\nis to be hoped that lumpy-jaw has not yet taken hold of the herds.\r\n\r\nNEW HAMPSHIRE:\r\n\r\nSpeaking generally, the New Hampshire laws regulating the killing and\r\nshipment of game are defective for the reason that on birds, and in fact\r\nall game save deer, there appear to be no \"bag\" limits on the quantity\r\nthat may be killed in a day or a season. The following bag limits are\r\ngreatly needed, forthwith:\r\n\r\n  Gray Squirrel, none per day, or per year; duck (except wood-duck),\r\n  ten per day, or thirty per season; ruffed grouse, four per day,\r\n  twelve per season; hare and rabbit, four per day, or twelve per\r\n  season.\r\n\r\n  Five-year close seasons should immediately be enacted for the\r\n  following species: quail, woodcock, jacksnipe and all species of\r\n  shore or \"beach\" birds.\r\n\r\n  The sale of all native wild game should be prohibited; and\r\n  game-breeding in preserves, and the sale of such game under state\r\n  supervision, should be provided for.\r\n\r\n  The use of automatic and pump guns in hunting should be\r\n  barred,--through state pride, if for no other reason.\r\n\r\nNEW JERSEY:\r\n\r\nNew Jersey enjoys the distinction of being the second state to break\r\nthe strangle-hold of the gun-makers of Hartford and Ilion, and cast out\r\nthe odious automatic and pump guns. It was a pitched battle,--that of\r\n1912, inaugurated by Ernest Napier, President of the State Game and Fish\r\nCommission and his fellow commissioners. The longer the contest\r\ncontinued, the more did the press and the people of New Jersey awaken to\r\nthe seriousness of the situation. Finally, the gun-suppression bill\r\npassed the two houses of the legislature with a total of only fourteen\r\nvotes against it, and after a full hearing had been granted the\r\nattorneys of the gunmakers, was promptly signed by Governor Woodrow\r\nWilson. _Governor Wilson could not be convinced that the act was\r\n\"unconstitutional,\" or \"confiscatory\" or \"class legislation.\"_\r\n\r\nThis contest aroused the whole state to the imperative necessity of\r\nproviding more thorough protection for the remnant of New Jersey game,\r\nand it was chiefly responsible for the enactment of four other excellent\r\nnew protective laws.\r\n\r\nNew Jersey always has been sincere in her desire to protect her wild\r\nlife, and always has gone _as far as the killers of game would permit\r\nher to go!_ But the People have made one great mistake,--common to\r\nnearly every state,--of permitting the game-killers to dictate the game\r\nlaws! _Always and everywhere, this is a grievous mistake_, and fatal to\r\nthe game. For example: In 1866 New Jersey enacted a five-year\r\nclose-season law on the \"prairie fowl\" (pinnated grouse); but it was too\r\nlate to save it. Now that species is as dead to New Jersey as is the\r\nmastodon. The moral is: Will the People apply this lesson to the ruffed\r\ngrouse, quail and the shore birds generally before they, too, are too\r\nfar gone to be brought back? If it is done, it must be done _against the\r\nwill of the gunners;_ for they prefer to shoot,--and shoot they will if\r\nthey can dictate the laws, until the last game bird is dead.\r\n\r\nIn 1912, New Jersey is spending $30,000 in trying to restock her\r\nbirdless covers with foreign game birds and quail. In brief, here are\r\nthe imperative duties of New Jersey:\r\n\r\n  Provide eight-year close seasons for quail, ruffed grouse, woodcock,\r\n  snipe, all shore birds and the wood-duck.\r\n\r\n  Prohibit the sale of all native wild game; but promote the sale of\r\n  preserve-bred game.\r\n\r\n  Prevent the repeal of the automatic gun law, which surely will be\r\n  attempted, each year.\r\n\r\n  Prohibit all bird-shooting after January 10, each year, until fall.\r\n\r\n  Prohibit the killing of squirrels as \"game.\"\r\n\r\nNEW MEXICO:\r\n\r\nAll things considered, the game laws of New Mexico are surprisingly up\r\nto date, and the state is to be congratulated on its advanced position.\r\nFor example, there are long close seasons on antelope, elk (now\r\nextinct!), mountain sheep, bob white quail, pinnated grouse, wild pigeon\r\nand ptarmigan,--an admirable list, truly. It is clear that New Mexico is\r\nwide awake to the dangers of the wild-life situation. On two counts, her\r\nlaws are not quite perfect. There is no law prohibiting spring shooting,\r\nand there is no \"model law\" protecting the non-game birds. The sale of\r\ngame will not trouble New Mexico, because the present laws prevent the\r\nsale of all protected game except plover, curlew and snipe,--all of them\r\nspecies by no means common in the arid regions of the Southwest.\r\n\r\n  A law prohibiting spring shooting of shore birds and waterfowl\r\n  should be passed at the next session of the legislature.\r\n\r\n  The enactment of the \"model law\" should be accomplished without\r\n  delay to put New Mexico abreast of the neighboring states of\r\n  Colorado, Oklahoma and Texas.\r\n\r\n  The term of the State Warden should be extended to four years.\r\n\r\nNEW YORK:\r\n\r\nIn the year of grace, 1912, I think we may justly regard New York as the\r\nbanner state of all America in the protection of game and wild life in\r\ngeneral. This proud position has been achieved partly through the\r\ninfluence of a great conservation Governor, John A. Dix, and the State\r\nConservation Commission proposed and created by his efforts. In these\r\ndays of game destruction, when our country from Nome to Key West is\r\nreeking with the blood of slaughtered wild creatures, it is a privilege\r\nand a pleasure to be a citizen of a state which has thoroughly cleaned\r\nhouse, and done well nigh the utmost that any state can do to clear her\r\nbad record, and give all her wild creatures a fair chance to survive.\r\nThe people of the Empire State literally can point with pride to the\r\nlist of things accomplished in the discharge of good-citizenship toward\r\nthe remnant of wild life, and toward the future generations of New\r\nYorkers. That we of to-day have borne our share of the burden of\r\nbringing about the conditions of 1912, will be a source of satisfaction,\r\nespecially when the sword and shield hang useless upon the walls of Old\r\nAge.\r\n\r\nNew York began to protect her deer in 1705 and her heath hens in 1708.\r\nIn 1912 she stopped the killing of female deer, and of bucks having\r\nhorns less than three inches in length. Spring shooting was stopped in\r\n1903. A comprehensive law protecting non-game birds was enacted in 1862.\r\nNew York's first law against the sale of certain game during close\r\nseasons was enacted in 1837.\r\n\r\nIn 1911 New York enacted, with only one adverse vote, a law prohibiting\r\nthe sale of all native wild game throughout the state, no matter where\r\nkilled, and providing liberally for the encouragement of game-breeding,\r\nand the sale of preserve-bred game.\r\n\r\nIn 1912 a new codification of the state game laws went into effect,\r\nthrough the initiative of Governor Dix and Conservation Commissioners\r\nVan Kennen, Moore and Fleming, assisted (as special counsel) by Marshall\r\nMcLean, George A. Lawyer and John B. Burnham. This code contains many\r\nimportant new provisions, one of the most valuable of which is a clause\r\ngiving the Conservation Commission power, at its discretion, to shorten\r\nor to close any open season on any species of game in any locality\r\nwherein that species seems to be threatened with extermination. This\r\nvery valuable principle should be enacted into law in every state!\r\n\r\nIn 1910, William Dutcher and T. Gilbert Pearson and the National\r\nAssociation of Audubon Societies won, after a struggle lasting five\r\nyears, the passage of the \"Shea plumage bill,\" prohibiting the sale of\r\naigrettes or other plumage of wild birds belonging to the same families\r\nas the birds of New York (Chap. 256). This law _should be duplicated in\r\nevery state._\r\n\r\n_Two things_ remain to be done in the state of New York.\r\n\r\n  All the shore birds, quail and gray squirrels of the state should be\r\n  given five-year close seasons, by the action of the State\r\n  Conservation Commission.\r\n\r\n  For the good name of the state, and the ethical standing of its\r\n  sportsmen, as an example to other states, and the last remaining\r\n  duty toward our wild life, the odious automatic and pump shotguns\r\n  should be barred from use in hunting, unless their capacity is\r\n  reduced to two shots without reloading.\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\nNEW LAWS NEEDED IN THE STATES\r\n(Concluded)\r\n\r\n\r\nNORTH CAROLINA:\r\n\r\nThe game laws of North Carolina form a droll crazy-quilt of local and\r\nstate measures, effective and ineffective. In 1909, a total of 77 local\r\ngame laws were enacted, and only two of state-wide application. During\r\nthe ten years ending in 1910, a total of 316 game laws were enacted! She\r\nsedulously endeavors to protect her quail, which do not migrate, but in\r\nCurrituck County she persistently maintains the bloodiest slaughter-pen\r\nfor waterfowl that exists anywhere on the Atlantic Coast. There is no\r\nbag limit on waterfowl, and unlimited spring shooting. So far as\r\nwaterfowl are concerned, conditions could hardly be worse, except by the\r\nuse of punt guns. Doves, _larks_ and _robins_ are shot and eaten as\r\n\"game\" from November 1 to March 1! Twenty-one counties have local\r\nrestrictions on the sale of game, but the state at large has only\r\none,--on quail.\r\n\r\nThe market gunners of Currituck Sound are a scourge and a pest to the\r\nwild-fowl life of the Atlantic Coast. For their own money profit, they\r\nslaughter by wholesale the birds that annually fly through twenty-two\r\nstates. It is quite useless to suggest anything to North Carolina in\r\nmodern game laws. As long as a killable bird remains, she will not stop\r\nthe slaughter. Her standing reply is \"It brings a lot of money into\r\nCurrituck County; and the people want the money.\" Even the members of\r\nthe sportsmen's clubs can shoot wild fowl in Currituck County, quite\r\nwithout limit; and I am told that the privilege often is abused. Quite\r\nrecently I heard of a member of one of the clubs who shot 164 ducks and\r\ngeese in two days!\r\n\r\nApparently any suggestions made to North Carolina would not be treated\r\nseriously, especially if they would tend really to elevate the sport of\r\ngame shooting, or better protect the game. There is, however, a\r\nmelancholy interest attached to the framing of good game laws, whether\r\nthey ever are likely to be adopted or not. Here is the duty of North\r\nCarolina:\r\n\r\n  Stop the killing of robins, doves and larks for food, absolutely and\r\n  forever. This measure is necessary to agriculture and to the good\r\n  name of the state.\r\n\r\n  Stop the shooting of any game for sale, prohibit the possession of\r\n  game for sale, and the sale of wild native game.\r\n\r\n  Establish bag limits on all waterfowl, and on all other game birds\r\n  and mammals.\r\n\r\n  Prepare to protect, at an early date, the wild turkey and quail;\r\n  for soon they will need it. Moreover, enact a law prohibiting the\r\n  use of automatic and pump guns in hunting, covering the entire\r\n  state.\r\n\r\n  Provide a resident-license system and thereby make the game\r\n  department self-sustaining, and render it possible to employ a\r\n  salaried State Game Commissioner.\r\n\r\nIt is quite wrong for the people of North Carolina to hold grudges\r\nagainst northern members of the ducking clubs of Currituck for the\r\npassage of the Bayne law. They had nothing whatever to do with it, and I\r\ncan say this because I was in a position which enabled me to know.\r\n\r\nNORTH DAKOTA:\r\n\r\nIn 1911, this sovereign state enacted a law _prohibiting the use of\r\nautomobiles_ in hunting wild-fowl; also rifles. North Dakota was the\r\nfirst state to recognize officially the fact that the use of automobiles\r\nin hunting is a serious menace to some forms of wild life. Beyond all\r\nquestion, the machines do indeed bring an extra number of birds within\r\nreach of the gun! They increase the annual slaughter; and it is right\r\nand necessary to prohibit by law their use in hunting game of any kind.\r\n\r\nIn Putman County, New York, I have seen them in action. A load of three\r\nor four gunners is whirled up to a likely mountain-side for ruffed\r\ngrouse, and presently the banging begins. After an hour or so spent in\r\ncombing out the birds, the hunters jump in, whirl away in a dust-cloud\r\nto another spot two miles away, and \"bang-bang-bang\" again. After that,\r\na third locality; and so on, covering six or eight times the territory\r\nthat a man in a buggy, or on foot, could possibly shoot over in the same\r\ntime!\r\n\r\nNorth Dakota has done well, in the passage of that act. On certain other\r\nmatters, she is not so sound.\r\n\r\nFor instance:\r\n\r\n  The killing of pinnated grouse should be stopped for ten years; and\r\n  it should be done immediately.\r\n\r\n  The killing of cranes as \"game\" should stop, instantly and forever.\r\n  It is barbarous.\r\n\r\n  Fifty dead birds in possession at one time is fully thirty too many.\r\n  The game cannot stand such slaughter!\r\n\r\n  All shore birds (_Order Limicolae_) should have at least a five-year\r\n  close season, before they are exterminated.\r\n\r\n  The use of machine guns in hunting should be stopped, forever.\r\n\r\nIt is to the credit of the state that antelope are absolutely protected\r\nuntil 1920, and an unlimited close season has been accorded the quail,\r\ndove and swan.\r\n\r\nOHIO:\r\n\r\nI think that Ohio comes the nearest of all the states to being gameless.\r\nWith but slight exceptions her laws are about as correct as those of\r\nmost other states, but the desire to \"kill\" is so strong, and the\r\nmajority of her gunners are so thoroughly selfish about their \"rights\"\r\nthat the game has ruthlessly been swept away _according to law!_ Ohio\r\nis a striking example of the deplorable results of _legalized_\r\nslaughter. The spirit of Ohio is like that of North Carolina. Her\r\n\"sportsmen\" will not have an automatic gun law! Oh, no! \"Limit the bag,\r\nshorten the season, and the gun won't matter!\"\r\n\r\nTo-day, the visible game supply of Ohio does not amount to anything; and\r\nwhen the last game bird of that state falls before the greediest\r\nshooter, we shall say, \"A gameless state is just what you deserve!\"\r\n\r\nIt is useless to make any suggestions to Ohio. Her shooting Shylocks\r\nwant the last pound of flesh from wild life, and I think they will get\r\nit very soon. Ohio is in the area of barren states. The seed stock has\r\nbeen too thoroughly destroyed to be recuperated. I think that Ohio's\r\nlast noteworthy exploit in lawmaking for the preservation (!) of her\r\ngame was in 1904, when she put all her shore birds into the list of\r\nkillable game, and bravely prohibited the shooting of doves _on the\r\nground!_ Great is Ohio in game conservation!\r\n\r\nOKLAHOMA:\r\n\r\nFor a state so young, the wild-life laws of Oklahoma are in admirable\r\nshape; but it is reasonably certain that there, as elsewhere, the game\r\nis being killed much faster than it is breeding. The new commonwealth\r\nmust arouse, and screw up the brakes much tighter.\r\n\r\nRecently, an observing friend told me that on a trip of 250 miles\r\nwestward from Lawton and back again, watching sharply for game all the\r\nway, he saw only five pinnated grouse! And this in a good season for\r\n\"prairie chickens.\"\r\n\r\n  Oklahoma must stop all spring shooting.\r\n\r\n  The prairie chicken must have a ten-year close season, immediately.\r\n\r\n  Next time, her legislature will pass the automatic gun bill that\r\n  failed last year only because the session closed too soon for its\r\n  consideration.\r\n\r\nOklahoma is wise in giving long protection to her quail, and \"wild\r\npigeon,\" and such protection should be made equally effective in the\r\ncase of the dove. She is wise in rigidly enforcing her law against the\r\nexportation of game.\r\n\r\nThe Wichita National Bison herd, near Cache, now contains forty head of\r\nbison, all in good condition. The nucleus herd consisted of fifteen head\r\npresented by the New York Zoological Society in 1907.\r\n\r\nOREGON:\r\n\r\nThe results of the efforts that have been made by Oregon to provide\r\nspecial laws for each individual shooter are painful to contemplate.\r\nLike North Carolina, Oregon has attempted the impossible task of\r\npleasing everybody, and at the same time protecting her wild life. The\r\ntwo propositions can be blended together about as easily as asphalt and\r\nwater. The individual shooter desires laws that will permit him to\r\nshoot--_when_ he pleases, _where_ he pleases, and _what_ he pleases! If\r\nyou meet those conditions all over a great state, then it is time to bid\r\nfarewell to the game; for it surely is doomed.\r\n\r\nNo, decidedly no! Do not attempt to pass game laws that will \"please\r\neverybody.\" The more the game-hogs are _displeased_, the better for the\r\ngame! The game-hogs form a very small and very insignificant minority of\r\nthe whole People. Why please one man at the expense of ninety-nine\r\nothers? The game of a state belongs to The People as a whole, not to the\r\ngunners alone. The great, patient,--and sometimes sleepy,--majority has\r\nvested rights in it, and it is for it to say how it shall and shall not\r\nbe killed. Heretofore the gunning minority has been dictating the game\r\nlaws of America, and the result is--progressive extermination.\r\n\r\n  First of all, Oregon should bury the pernicious idea of individual\r\n  and local laws.\r\n\r\n  She should enact a concise, clearly cut, and thoroughly effective\r\n  code of wild life laws, just as New York did last winter.\r\n\r\n  Her game seasons should be uniform in application, all over the\r\n  state.\r\n\r\n  Every species of bird, mammal or fish that is threatened with\r\n  extermination should be given a close season of from five to ten\r\n  years.\r\n\r\n  It is now time to protect the white goose and brant. Squirrels,\r\n  band-tailed pigeons and doves should be perpetually protected.\r\n\r\n  The State Game Commission should have power to close the shooting\r\n  seasons on any species of game in any locality, whenever a species\r\n  is threatened with extinction.\r\n\r\n  The sale of native wild game, from all sources, should be\r\n  permanently stopped, by a Bayne law.\r\n\r\n  The use of automatic, \"autoloading\" and pump shot guns in hunting\r\n  should be perpetually barred.\r\n\r\n\r\nPENNSYLVANIA:\r\n\r\nAs a game protecting state, Pennsylvania is a close second to New York\r\nand Massachusetts. She protects all native game from sale; _she has the\r\ncourage to prohibit aliens from owning guns; she bars out automatic\r\nshot-guns in hunting_; she makes refuges for deer, and feeds her quail\r\nin winter, and she permits the killing of no female deer, or fawns with\r\nhorns less than three inches in length. Her splendid State Game\r\nCommission is fighting hard for a hunter's license law, and will win the\r\nfight for it at the next session of the legislature (1913).\r\n\r\nBut there are certain things that Pennsylvania should do:\r\n\r\n  She should stop all spring shooting. She must stop killing doves,\r\n  blackbirds, wild turkeys, sandpipers, and all the squirrels save the\r\n  red squirrel.\r\n\r\n  She should give all her shore birds a rest of at least five years,\r\n  for recuperation.\r\n\r\n  She should enact a comprehensive Dutcher plumage law, stopping the\r\n  sale of aigrettes.\r\n\r\n  She should provide a resident license to furnish her Game Commission\r\n  with adequate funds to carry on its work and exterminate\r\n  game-killing vermin.\r\n\r\n\r\nRHODE ISLAND:\r\n\r\n  Little Rhody needs some good, small bag limits; for now (1912) she\r\n  has none!\r\n\r\n  She should enact a Bayne law, a Pennsylvania law against aliens,\r\n  and a New Jersey law against the automatic and pump guns.\r\n\r\n  She should stop killing the beautiful wood-duck, and gray squirrel.\r\n\r\n  She should stop all spring shooting of waterfowl.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOUTH CAROLINA:\r\n\r\n  She should save her game while she still has some to save.\r\n\r\n  First of all, stop spring shooting; secondly, enact a Bayne law.\r\n\r\n  In the name of mystery, who is there in South Carolina who desires\r\n  to kill grackles? And why?\r\n\r\n  And where is the gentleman sportsman who has come down to killing\r\n  foolish and tame little doves for \"sport?\" Stop it at once, for the\r\n  credit of the state.\r\n\r\n  Enact a dollar resident license law and thus provide adequate funds\r\n  for game protection.\r\n\r\n  South Carolina bag limits are all 50 per cent too high; and they\r\n  should be reduced.\r\n\r\nIt is strange to see one of the oldest of the states lagging in game\r\nprotection, far behind such new states as New Mexico and Oklahoma; but\r\nSouth Carolina does lag. It is time for her to consider her position,\r\nand reform.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOUTH DAKOTA:\r\n\r\n  South Dakota should stop all spring shooting.\r\n\r\n  Her game-bag limits are really no limits at all! They should be\r\n  reduced about 66 per cent without a moment's unnecessary delay.\r\n\r\n  The two year term of the State Warden is too short for effective\r\n  work. It should be extended to four years.\r\n\r\nUnless South Dakota wishes to repeat the folly of such states as\r\nIndiana, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri and Ohio, she needs to be up and\r\ndoing. If her people want a gameless state, except for migratory\r\nwaterfowl, all they need do is to slumber on, and they surely will have\r\nit. Why wait until greedy sportsmen have killed the last game bird of\r\nthe state before seriously taking the matter in hand? In one act, all\r\nthe shortcomings of the present laws can be corrected.\r\n\r\nSouth Dakota needs no Bayne law, because she prohibits at all times the\r\nsale or exportation of all wild game.\r\n\r\n\r\nTENNESSEE:\r\n\r\nIn wild life protection, Tennessee has much to do. She made her start\r\nlate in life, and what she needs to do is to draft with care and enact\r\nwith cheerful alacrity certain necessary amendments.\r\n\r\nWe notice that there are open seasons for _blackbirds, robins, doves and\r\nsquirrels_! It seems incredible; but it is true.\r\n\r\nBehold the blackbird as a \"game\" bird, with a lawful open season from\r\nSeptember 1 to January 1. Consider its stately carriage, its rapid\r\nflight on the wing, its running and hiding powers when attacked. As a\r\ntest of marksmanship, as the real thing for the expert wing shot, is it\r\nnot great? Will not any self-respecting dog be proud to point or\r\nretrieve them? And what flesh for the table!\r\n\r\nFancy an able-bodied sportsman going out in a fifty-dollar hunting suit,\r\ncarrying a fifteen-dollar gun behind a seven-dollar dog, and returning\r\nwith a glorious bag of twenty-five blackbirds! Or robins! Or doves!\r\nProud indeed, would we be to belong (which we don't) to a club of\r\n\"sportsmen\" who go out shooting blackbirds, and robins, and foolish\r\nlittle doves, as \"game!\" \"Game\" indeed, are those birds,--for little\r\nlads of seven who do not know better; but not for boys of twelve who\r\nhave in their veins any inheritance of sporting blood. (I am proud of\r\nthe fact that at twelve years of age,--and ever so keen to \"go\r\nhunting,\"--I knew without being told that squirrels and doves were not\r\n_real_ \"game\" for real boys.)\r\n\r\nThe killers of doves, squirrels, blackbirds and robins belong in the\r\nsame class as the sparrow-and-linnet-killing Italians of Venice, Milan\r\nand Turin, and in that company we will leave them.\r\n\r\nTennessee needs:\r\n\r\n  A resident license system to provide funds for game protection.\r\n\r\n  A salaried warden force.\r\n\r\n  A law prohibiting spring shooting of shore birds and waterfowl.\r\n\r\n  A law protecting robins, doves and other non-game birds not covered\r\n  by the present statute.\r\n\r\n\r\nTEXAS:\r\n\r\nI remember well when the great battle was fought in Texas by the gallant\r\nmen and women of the State Audubon Society, to compel the people of\r\nTexas to learn the economic value to agriculture and cotton of the\r\ninsectivorous birds. The name of the splendid Brigadier-General who led\r\nthe Army of the Defense was Capt. M.B. Davis. That was in 1903.\r\n\r\nSince that great fight was won, Texas has been a partly reformed state,\r\nat times quite jealous of her bird life; but still she tolerates spring\r\nshooting and has not made adequate close seasons for her waterfowl;\r\nwhich is wrong. To-day, the people of Texas do not need to be told that\r\nforty-three species of birds feed on the cotton boll weevil; for they\r\nknow it.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, and for a southern state, the wild-life laws of Texas are\r\nin fairly good shape. On account of the absence of game-scourge markets,\r\na Bayne law is not so imperatively necessary there as in certain other\r\nstates. All the game of the state is protected from sale.\r\n\r\nWe do assert, however, that if robins are slaughtered as F.L. Crow, the\r\nformer Atlantan asserts, all robin shooting should be forever stopped;\r\nthat the pinnated grouse should be given a seven-year close season, and\r\nthat doves should be taken off the list of game birds and perpetually\r\nprotected, both for economic and sentimental reasons, and also because\r\nthe too weak and confiding dove is not a \"game\" bird for red-blooded\r\nmen.\r\n\r\n  Texas should enact without delay a law providing close seasons for\r\n  ducks, geese and other waterfowl;\r\n\r\n  A law prohibiting spring shooting, and\r\n\r\n  A provision reducing the limit on deer to two bucks a season.\r\n\r\nUTAH:\r\n\r\nThe laws of Utah are far from being up to the requirements of the\r\npresent hour. One strange thing has happened in Utah.\r\n\r\nWhen I spent a week in Salt Lake City in 1888, and devoted some time to\r\ninquiring into game conditions, the laws of the state were very bad. At\r\nthe mouth of Bear River, ducks were being slaughtered for the markets by\r\nthe tens of thousands. The cold-blooded, wide open and utterly shameless\r\nway in which it was being done, right at the doors of Salt Lake City,\r\nwas appalling.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the law permitted the slaughter of _spotted fawns_. I\r\nsaw a huge drygoods box filled to the top with the flat skins of\r\nslaughtered innocents, _260 in number_, that a rascal had collected and\r\nwas offering at fifty cents each. In reply to a question as to their\r\nuse, he said: \"I tink de sportsmen like 'em for to make vests oud of.\"\r\nHe lived at Rawlins, Wyo.\r\n\r\nAfter a long and somnolent period, during which hundreds of thousands of\r\nducks, geese, brant and other birds had been slaughtered for market at\r\nthe Bear River shambles and elsewhere, the state awoke sufficiently to\r\nabate a portion of the disgrace by passing a bag-limit law (1897).\r\n\r\nAnd then came Nature's punishment upon Utah for that duck slaughter. The\r\nducks of Great Salt Lake became afflicted with a terrible epidemic\r\ndisease (intestinal coccidiosis) which swept off thousands, and stopped\r\nthe use of Utah ducks as food! It was a \"duck plague,\" no less. It has\r\nprevailed for three years, and has not yet by any means been stamped\r\nout. It seems to be due to the fact that countless thousands of ducks\r\nhave been feeding on the exposed alluvial flats at the mouth of the\r\ncreek that drains off the _sewage of Salt Lake City_. The conditions are\r\nsaid to be terrible.\r\n\r\nTo-day, Utah is so nearly destitute of big game that the subject is\r\nhardly worthy of mention. Of her upland game birds, only a fraction\r\nremains, and as her laws stand to-day, she is destined to become in the\r\nnear future a gameless state. In a dry region like this, the wild life\r\nalways hangs on by a slender thread, and it is easy to exterminate it!\r\n\r\n  Utah should instantly stop the sale of game that she now legally\r\n  provides for,--twenty-five shore birds and waterfowl per day to\r\n  private parties!\r\n\r\n  Deer should be given a ten-year close season, at once. All bag\r\n  limits should instantly be reduced one-half. The sage grouse, quail,\r\n  swans, woodcock, dove, and all shore birds should be given a\r\n  ten-year close season,--and rigidly protected,--before the stock is\r\n  all gone.\r\n\r\n  The model law for the protection of non-game birds should be enacted\r\n  at once.\r\n\r\n  The absolute protection of elk, antelope and sheep (until 1913)\r\n  should be extended for twenty years.\r\n\r\n  Utah should create a big-game preserve, at once.\r\n\r\nIf Utah proposes to save even a remnant of her wild life for posterity,\r\nshe must be up and doing.\r\n\r\nVERMONT:\r\n\r\nIn view of all conditions, it must be stated that the game laws of\r\nVermont are, with but slight exceptions, in good condition. It is a\r\npleasure to see that there is no spring shooting; that there is no\r\n\"open\" season of slaughter for the moose, caribou, wood-duck, swan,\r\nupland plover, dove or rail; that no buck deer with antlers less than\r\nthree inches long may be killed; and that there is a law under which\r\ndamages by deer to growing crops may be assessed and paid for by the\r\ncounty in which they occur. Moreover, if there is to be any killing of\r\ngame, her bag limits are not extravagant. All the game protected by the\r\nstate is immune from sale for food purposes, but preserve-reared game\r\nmay legally be sold. We recommend the following new measures:\r\n\r\n  Absolute close seasons of five-years' duration for ruffed grouse,\r\n  quail, woodcock, snipe and all shore birds without a single\r\n  exception.\r\n\r\n  The gray squirrel should be perpetually protected,--because he is\r\n  too beautiful, too companionable and too unfit for food to be\r\n  killed. Even the hungry savages of the East Indies do not eat\r\n  squirrels.\r\n\r\n  Pass an automatic pump-gun law.\r\n\r\n  Extend the term of the Fish and Game Commissioner to four years.\r\n\r\nVermont's great success in introducing and colonizing deer is both\r\ninteresting and valuable. Fifty years ago, she had no wild deer, because\r\nthe species had been practically exterminated. In 1875, thirteen deer\r\nwere imported from the Adirondacks and set free in the mountains. The\r\nincrease has been enormous. In 1909 the number of deer killed for the\r\nyear was about 5,311, which was possible without adversely affecting the\r\nherds. It is a striking object-lesson in restoring the white-tailed deer\r\nto its own, and it will be found more fully described in chapter XXIV.\r\n\r\nVIRGINIA:\r\n\r\nVirginia is far below the position that she should occupy in wild-life\r\nconservation. To set her house in order, and come up to the level of the\r\nstates that have been born during the past twenty years, she must bestir\r\nherself in these ways:\r\n\r\n  She must provide for a resident hunting license, a State Game\r\n  Commissioner and a force of salaried wardens.\r\n\r\n  She must prohibit spring shooting.\r\n\r\n  She must impose small bag limits on game-slaughter.\r\n\r\n  She must resolutely stop the sale of all wild game.\r\n\r\n  She must stop the killing of female deer, and of bucks with horns\r\n  under three inches long.\r\n\r\n  She must stop killing gray squirrels and doves as \"game.\"\r\n\r\n  She should not permit the beautiful wood-duck to be killed as\r\n  \"game.\"\r\n\r\n  She should accord a five-year close season to grouse, and all shore\r\n  birds.\r\n\r\n  She should rule out the machine shot-guns which gentlemen can no\r\n  longer use in hunting.\r\n\r\nShe should adopt at once a comprehensive code of game laws, and clean\r\nher house in one siege, instead of fiddling and fussing with all these\r\nmatters one by one, through a series of ten long, weary years. The time\r\nfor puttering with game protection has gone by. It is now time to make\r\nshort cuts to comprehensive results, and save the game before it is too\r\nlate.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON:\r\n\r\nThe state of Washington still flatters herself that she has all kinds of\r\nbig game to kill,--moose, antelope, goat, sheep, caribou and deer.\r\nEvidently this is on the theory that so long as a species is not\r\nextinct, it is \"legal\" and right to pursue it with rifles during a\r\nspecified \"open season.\"\r\n\r\nThe people of Washington need to be told that conditions have greatly\r\nchanged, and it is now high time to put on the brakes. It is time for\r\nthem to realize that if they wait any longer for the sportsmen to take\r\nthe initiative in securing the enactment of really adequate preservation\r\nlaws, all their big game will be dead before those laws are born! Every\r\nman shrinks from cutting off his own pet privilege.\r\n\r\nSome of the game laws of Washington are up to date; and her big-game\r\nlaws look all right to the unaided eye, but are not. Her bird laws are a\r\nchaotic jumble of local exceptions and special privileges. As a net\r\nresult of all her shortcomings, the remnant of a once fine fauna of big\r\ngame and feathered game is surely being _exterminated according to law._\r\nA few local exceptions will not disprove the general truthfulness of\r\nthis assertion.\r\n\r\nTen years ago a few men in Seattle resented the idea of outside\r\nco-operation in the protection of Washington game. They said they were\r\nabundantly able to take care of it; but the march of events has proven\r\nthat they overestimated their capacity. To-day the wild-life laws of\r\nthat state are only half baked. Come what may to me, I shall set down\r\nwithout malice the things that the great and admirable State of\r\nWashington should do to set her house in order. It is not good for the\r\nresourceful and progressive men of the Great Northwest to be clear\r\nbehind the times in these matters.\r\n\r\n_Stop local game legislation, and enact a code of laws covering the\r\nentire state, uniformly. County legislation is twenty years behind the\r\ntimes!_\r\n\r\n  For ten (10) full years, stop the killing of elk, mountain sheep,\r\n  mountain goat, caribou, moose, and antelope. Regarding deer, I am in\r\n  doubt.\r\n\r\n  Prohibit the sale of all wild game, no matter where killed, by the\r\n  enactment of a Bayne law, complete, which will also\r\n\r\n  Promote the breeding, killing and sale of domestic game for food\r\n  purposes.\r\n\r\n  Make a careful investigation of the present status of your sage\r\n  grouse, every other grouse, quail, and all species of shore birds,\r\n  then give a five-year close season, all over the state, to every\r\n  species that is \"becoming scarce.\" This will embrace certainly\r\n  one-half of the whole number, if not two-thirds.\r\n\r\n  Provide two bird refuges in the eastern portion of the state, where\r\n  they are very greatly needed to supplement the good effects of the\r\n  State Game Preserve established on Puget Sound in 1911.\r\n\r\n  Bar the use in hunting of the odious automatic and pump shotguns\r\n  that are now so generally in use all over the United States to the\r\n  great detriment of the game and the people.\r\n\r\nWEST VIRGINIA:\r\n\r\nConsidering the fact that West Virginia contains no plague-spot city for\r\nthe consumption of commercial wild game, that the sale of all game is\r\nprohibited at all times, and the game of the state may not be exported\r\nfor sale elsewhere, the wild life of West Virginia is reasonably secure\r\nfrom the market gunner,--if an adequate salaried warden force is\r\nprovided. Without such a force her game must continue to be destroyed in\r\nthe future as in the past to supply the markets of Pittsburgh,\r\nPhiladelphia, Baltimore and Washington. The deer law is excellent, and\r\nthe non-game birds, and the dove and wood-duck are perpetually\r\nprotected.\r\n\r\nOne fly in the ointment is--spring shooting; which for ducks, geese and\r\nbrant continues from September 1 to April 20. Unfortunately the law\r\nenacted in 1875 against spring shooting has been _repealed,_ and so has\r\nthe resident hunting license law (1911).\r\n\r\nIn view of the impossibility of imagining a good reason for the repeal\r\nof a good law, we recommend:\r\n\r\n  That the law against spring shooting be re-enacted.\r\n\r\n  That the resident hunter's license law be re-enacted, and the\r\n  proceeds specifically devoted to the preservation and increase of\r\n  game.\r\n\r\n  That a force of regular salaried wardens be provided to enforce the\r\n  laws.\r\n\r\n  That the bag limit on quail should be 10 per day or 40 per season,\r\n  instead of 12 and 96; and on ruffed grouse it should be 3 per day\r\n  (as in New York) or 12 per season. One wild turkey per day, or three\r\n  per season is quite enough for one man. The visible supply will not\r\n  justify the existing limit of two and six.\r\n\r\n\r\nWISCONSIN:\r\n\r\nIn spite of the fierce fight made in 1910-11 by the saloon-element\r\ngame-shooters of Milwaukee for the control of the wild-life situation,\r\nand the repeal of the best protective laws of the state, the Army of\r\nDefense once more defeated the Allied Destroyers, and drove them off the\r\nfield. Once more it was proven that when The People are aroused, they\r\nare abundantly able to send the steam roller over the enemies of wild\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nAlphabetically, Wisconsin may come near the end of the roll-call; but by\r\ndownright merit in protection, she comes mighty close to the head of the\r\nlist of states. Her slate of \"Work to be done\" is particularly clean;\r\nand she has our most distinguished admiration. Her force of game wardens\r\nis not a political-machine force. It amounts to something. The men who\r\nget within it undergo successfully a civil service examination that\r\ncertainly separates the sheep from the goats. For particulars address\r\nDr. T.S. Palmer, Department of Agriculture, Washington.\r\n\r\nAccording to the standards that have been dragging along previous to\r\nthis moment, Wisconsin has a good series of game laws. But the hour for\r\na Reformation of ideas and principles has struck. We heard it first in\r\nApril, 1911. The wild life of America must not be exterminated according\r\nto law, contrary to law, or in the absence of law! Wisconsin must take\r\na fresh grip on her game situation, or it will get away from her, after\r\nall.\r\n\r\n  Not another prairie chicken or woodcock should be killed in\r\n  Wisconsin between 1912 and 1922. When any small bird becomes so\r\n  scarce that the bag limit needs to be cut down to five, as it now is\r\n  for the above in Wisconsin, it is time to stop for ten years, before\r\n  it is too late.\r\n\r\n  Wisconsin should immediately busy herself about the creation of bird\r\n  and game preserves.\r\n\r\n  For goodness sake, Wisconsin, stop killing squirrels as \"game!\" You\r\n  ought to know better--and you do! Leave that form of barbarism for\r\n  the Benighted States.\r\n\r\n  And pass a law shutting out the machine guns. They are a disgrace to\r\n  our country, and a scourge to our game. Continually are they leading\r\n  good men astray.\r\n\r\n  Extend the term of your State Warden to four years.\r\n\r\n\r\nWYOMING:\r\n\r\nThe State of Wyoming once had a magnificent heritage of game. It\r\nembraced the Rocky Mountain species, and also those of the great plains.\r\nFirst and last, the state has worked hard to protect her wild life, and\r\nhold the killing of it down to a decent basis.\r\n\r\nAs far back as 1889, I met on the Shoshone River a very wide-awake\r\nwarden, actually \"on his job,\" who was maintained by a body of private\r\ncitizens headed by Col. Pickett and known as the Northern Wyoming Game\r\nProtective Association. And even then we saw that the laws were too\r\nliberal for the game. In one man's cold-storage dug-out we saw enough\r\nsheep, deer and elk meat to subsist a company of hungry dragoons, all\r\nkilled and possessed according to law.\r\n\r\nIn the protection of her mountain game, Wyoming has had a hard task. In\r\nthe Yellowstone Park between 1889 and 1894, the poachers for the\r\ntaxidermists of Livingston and elsewhere slaughtered 270 bison out of\r\n300; and Howell was the only man caught. England can protect game in\r\nfar-distant mountains and wildernesses; but America can not,--or at\r\nleast _we don't!_ With us, men living in remote places who find wild\r\ngame about them say \"To h--- with the law!\" They kill on the sly, in\r\nseason and out of season, females and males; and the average local jury\r\nsimply _will not_ convict the average settler who is accused of such a\r\ntrifling indiscretion as killing game out of season when he \"needs the\r\nmeat.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so, with laws in full force protecting females, the volume of big\r\ngame steadily disappears, _everywhere west of the Alleghanies where the\r\nlaw permits big-game hunting!_ An interesting chapter might be written\r\non game exterminated according to law.\r\n\r\nThe deadly defects in the protection of western big game are:\r\n\r\n  Structural weakness in the enforcement of the laws;\r\n\r\n  Collusion between offenders for the suppression of evidence;\r\n\r\n  Perjury on the witness stand;\r\n\r\n  Dishonesty and disloyalty on the part of local jurors when friends,\r\n  are on trial;\r\n\r\n  Sympathy of judges for \"the poor man\" who wants to eat the game to\r\n  save his cattle and sheep.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: (Map of) STATES AND PROVINCES WHICH REQUIRE RESIDENTS TO\r\nOBTAIN HUNTING LICENSES, 1912\r\n\r\n  In Connecticut, New Jersey, New York, Oklahoma and Rhode Island an\r\n  additional fee of 10 to 20 cents is charged for issuing the license.\r\n\r\n  Inclosed names indicate States which permit residents to hunt on\r\n  their own land without license. Nova Scotia has a $5 resident\r\n  license and exempts landowners.\r\n\r\n  Note that many of the States adopt the French method of exempting\r\n  landowners, while some, particularly in the West follow the English\r\n  method of requiring everyone who hunts to obtain a license.\r\n\r\nFrom Farmers' Bulletin No. 510, U-S. Dept. of Agriculture]\r\n\r\nElsewhere there appears a statement regarding the elk of Jackson Hole,\r\nand the efforts made and being made to save them. At this point we are\r\ninterested in the game of Wyoming as a whole.\r\n\r\n  First of all, the killing of mountain sheep should absolutely cease,\r\n  for ten years.\r\n\r\n  A similar ten-year close season should be accorded moose and\r\n  prong-horned antelope.\r\n\r\n  All grouse should now be classed with doves and swans (no open\r\n  season), and kept there for ten years.\r\n\r\n  Spring shooting is wrong in principle and vicious in practice; and\r\n  it should be stopped in Wyoming, as elsewhere.\r\n\r\n  The automatic and pump shotguns when used in hunting are a disgrace\r\n  to Wyoming, as they are to other states, and should be suppressed;\r\n  and the silencer for use in hunting is in the black list.\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\nNEED FOR A FEDERAL MIGRATORY BIRD LAW, NO-SALE-OF-GAME LAW, AND OTHERS\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are assuming that the American people sincerely desire the adequate\r\nprotection and increase of bird life, for reasons that are both\r\nsentimental and commercial. Surely every good citizen dislikes to see\r\nmillions of dollar's worth of national wealth foolishly wasted, and he\r\ndislikes to pay any unnecessary increased cost of living. There must be\r\nseveral millions of Americans who feel that way, and who are disposed to\r\ndemand a complete revolution in bird protection.\r\n\r\nThere are four needs of wild bird life that are fundamental, and that\r\ncan not be ignored, any more than a builder can ignore the four\r\ncornerstones of his building. Listed in the order of their importance,\r\nthey are as follows:\r\n\r\n  1.--_The federal protection of all migratory birds._\r\n\r\n  2.--_The total suppression of the sale of native wild game_.\r\n\r\n  3.--_The total suppression of spring shooting and of shooting in the\r\n  breeding season, and_\r\n\r\n  4.--_Long close seasons for all species that are about to be \"shot\r\n  out_.\"\r\n\r\nIf the gunners of America wish to have a gameless continent, all they\r\nneed do to secure it is to oppose these principles, prevent their\r\ntranslation into law, and maintain the status quo. If they do this, then\r\n_all our best birds are doomed to swift destruction_. Let no man make a\r\nmistake on that point. The \"open seasons\" and \"bag limits\" of the United\r\nStates to-day are just as deadly as the 5,000,000 sporting guns now in\r\nuse, and the 700,000,000 annual cartridges. It is only the ignorant or\r\nthe vicious who will seriously dispute this statement.\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERAL PROTECTION OF MIGRATORY BIRDS.--The bill now before Congress\r\nfor the protection of all migratory birds by the national government is\r\nthe most important measure ever placed before that body in behalf of\r\nwild life. A stranger to this proposition will need to pause for thought\r\nin order to grasp its full meaning, and appreciate the magnitude of its\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\nThe urgent necessity for a law of this nature is due to the utter\r\ninadequacy of the laws that prevail throughout some portions of the\r\nUnited States concerning the slaughter and preservation of birds. Any\r\nlaw that is not enforced is a poor law. There is not one state in the\r\nUnion, nor a single province in Canada, in which the game birds, and\r\nother birds criminally shot as game, are not being killed far faster\r\nthan they are breeding, and thereby being exterminated.\r\n\r\nSeveral states are financially unable to employ a force of salaried game\r\nwardens; and wherever that is true, the door to universal slaughter is\r\nwide open. Let him who questions this take Virginia as a case in point.\r\nA loyal Virginian told me only this year that in his state the warden\r\nsystem is an ineffective farce, and the game is not protected, because\r\nthe wardens can not afford to patrol the state for nothing.\r\n\r\nThis condition prevails in a number of states, north and south,\r\nespecially south. It is my belief that throughout nine-tenths of the\r\nSouth, the negroes and poor whites are slaughtering birds exactly as\r\nthey please. It is the _permanent residents_ of the haunts of birds and\r\ngame that are exterminating the wild life.\r\n\r\nThe value of the birds as destroyers of noxious insects, has been set\r\nforth in Chapter XXIII. Their total value is enormous--or it _would_ be\r\nif the birds were alive and here in their normal numbers. To-day there\r\nare about one-tenth as many birds as were alive and working thirty years\r\nago. During the past thirty years the destruction of our game birds has\r\nbeen enormous, and the insectivorous birds have greatly decreased.\r\n\r\nThe damages annually inflicted upon the farm, orchard and garden crops\r\nof this country are very great. When a city is destroyed by earthquake\r\nor fire, and $100,000,000 worth of property is swept away, we are racked\r\nwith horror and pity; and the cities of America pour out money like\r\nwater to relieve the resultant distress. We are shocked because we can\r\n_see_ the flames, the smoke and the ruins.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, we annually endure with perfect equanimity (_because we can not\r\nsee it_?) a loss of nearly $400,000,000 worth of value that is destroyed\r\nby insects. The damage is inflicted silently, insidiously, without any\r\nscare heads or wooden type in the newspapers, and so we pay the price\r\nwithout protest. We know--when we stop to think of it--that not all this\r\nloss falls upon the producer. We know that every consumer of bread,\r\ncereals, vegetables and fruit _pays his share of this loss_! To-day,\r\nmillions of people are groaning under the \"increased cost of living.\"\r\nThe bill for the federal protection of all migratory birds is directly\r\nintended to decrease the cost of living, by preventing outrageous waste;\r\nbut of all the persons to whom the needs of that bill are presented, how\r\nmany will take the time to promote its quick passage by direct appeals\r\nto their members of Congress? We shall see.\r\n\r\nThe good that would be accomplished, annually, by the enactment of a law\r\nfor the federal protection of all migratory birds is beyond computation;\r\nbut it is my belief that within a very few years the increase in bird\r\nlife would prevent what is now an annual loss of $250,000,000. It is\r\nbeyond the power of man to protect his crops and fruit and trees as the\r\nbird millions would protect them--if they were here as they were in\r\n1870. The migratory bird bill is of vast importance because it would\r\nthrow the strong arm of federal protection around 610 species of birds.\r\nThe power of Uncle Sam is respected and feared in many places where the\r\npower of the state is ignored.\r\n\r\nThe list of migratory birds includes most of the perching birds; all the\r\nshore birds (_great_ destroyers of bad insects); all the swifts and\r\nswallows; the goat-suckers (whippoorwill and nighthawk); some of the\r\nwoodpeckers; most of the rails; pigeons and doves; many of the hawks;\r\nsome of the cranes and herons and all the geese, ducks and swans.\r\n\r\nA movement for the federal protection of migratory game birds was\r\nproposed to Congress by George Shiras, 3rd, who as a member of the House\r\nin the 58th Congress introduced a bill to secure that end. An excellent\r\nbrief on that subject by Mr. Shiras appeared in the printed hearing on\r\nthe McLean bill, held on March 6, 1912, page 18. Omitting the bills\r\nintroduced in the 59th, 60th and 61st sessions, mention need be made\r\nonly of the measures under consideration in the present Congress. One of\r\nthese is a bill introduced by Representative J.W. Weeks, of\r\nMassachusetts, and another is the bill of Representative D.R. Anthony,\r\nJr., of Kansas, of the same purport.\r\n\r\nFinally, on April 24, 1912, an adequate and entirely reasonable bill was\r\nintroduced in the Senate by Senator George P. McLean, of Connecticut, as\r\nNo. 6497 (Calendar No. 606). This bill provides federal protection for\r\n_all_ migratory birds, and embraces all save a very few of the species\r\nthat are specially destructive to noxious insects. The bill provides\r\nnational protection to the farmer's and fruit-grower's best friends. It\r\nis entitled to the enthusiastic support of 90,000,000 of people, native\r\nand alien. Every producer of farm products and every consumer of them\r\nowes it to himself to write at once to his member of Congress and ask\r\nhim (1) to urge the speedy consideration of the bill for the federal\r\nprotection of all migratory birds, (2) to vote for it, and (3) to work\r\nfor it until it is passed. It matters not which one of the three bills\r\ndescribed finally becomes a law. Will the American people act rationally\r\nabout this matter, and protect their own interests?\r\n\r\nSUPPRESS THE SALE OF ALL NATIVE WILD GAME.--The deadly effect of the\r\ncommercial slaughter of game and its sale for food is now becoming well\r\nunderstood by the American people. One by one the various state\r\nlegislatures have been putting up the bars against the exportation or\r\nsale of any \"game protected by the state.\" The U.S. Department of\r\nAgriculture says, through Henry Oldys, that \"free marketing of wild game\r\nleads swiftly to extermination;\" and it is literally true.\r\n\r\nUp to March, 1911, it appears that several states prohibited the sale of\r\ngame, sixteen states permitted the sale of all unprotected game, and in\r\neight more there was partial prohibition. Unfortunately, however, many\r\nof these states permitted the sale of _imported_ game. Now, since it\r\nhappened to be a fact that the vast majority of the states prohibit the\r\n_export_ of their game, as well as the sale of it, a very large quantity\r\nof such game as quail, ruffed grouse, snipe, woodcock and shore birds\r\nwas illegally shot for the market, exported in defiance both of state\r\nlaws and the federal Lacey Act, and sold to the detriment of the states\r\nthat produced it. In other words, in the laws of each state that merely\r\nsought to protect _their own_ game, regardless of the game of\r\nneighboring states, there was not merely a loop-hole, but there was a\r\ngap wide enough to drive through with a coach and four. The ruffed\r\ngrouse of Massachusetts and Connecticut often were butchered to make\r\nGotham holidays in joyous contempt of the laws at both ends of the line.\r\nAs a natural result the game of the Atlantic coast was disappearing at a\r\nfrightful rate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EIGHTEEN STATES ENTIRELY PROHIBIT THE SALE OF GAME WHY DO\r\nTHE OTHERS LAG BEHIND?]\r\n\r\nIn 1911, the no-sale-of-game law of New York was born out of sheer\r\ndesperation. The Army of Destruction went up to Albany well-organized,\r\nwell provided with money and attorneys, with three senators in the\r\nSenate and two assemblymen in the lower house, to wage merciless warfare\r\non the whole wild-life cause. The market gunners and game dealers not\r\nonly proposed to repeal the law against spring shooting but also to\r\ndefeat all legislation that might be attempted to restrict the sale of\r\ngame, or impose bag limits on wild fowl. The Milliners' Association\r\nproposed to wipe off the books the Dutcher law against the use of the\r\nplumage of wild birds in millinery, and an assemblyman was committed to\r\nthat cause as its special champion.\r\n\r\nThen it was that all the friends of wild life in the Empire State\r\nresolved upon a death grapple with the Destroyers, and a fight to an\r\nabsolute finish. The Bayne bill, entirely prohibiting the sale of all\r\nnative wild game throughout the state of New York, was drafted and\r\nthrown into the ring, and the struggle began. At first the\r\nno-sale-of-game bill looked like sheer madness, but no sooner was it\r\nfairly launched than supporters came flocking in from every side. All\r\nthe organizations of sportsmen and friends of wild life combined in one\r\nmighty army, the strength of which was irresistible. The real sportsmen\r\nof the state quickly realized that the no-sale bill was _directly in the\r\ninterest of legitimate sport_. The great mass of people who love wild\r\nlife, and never kill, were quick to comprehend the far-reaching\r\nimportance of the measure, and they supported it, with money and\r\nenthusiasm.\r\n\r\nThe members of the legislature received thousands of letters from their\r\nconstituents, asking them to support the Bayne-Blauvelt bill. They did\r\nso. On its passage through the two houses, only _one_ vote was recorded\r\nagainst it! Incidentally, every move attempted by the Army of\r\nDestruction was defeated and in the final summing up the defeat amounted\r\nto an utter rout.\r\n\r\nIn 1912, after a tremendous struggle, the legislature of Massachusetts\r\npassed a counterpart of the Bayne law, and took her place in the front\r\nrank of states. That was a great fight. The market-gunners of Cape Cod,\r\nthe game dealers and other interests entered the struggle with men in\r\nthe lower house of the legislature specially elected to look after their\r\ninterests. Just as in New York in 1911, they proposed to repeal the\r\nexisting laws against spring shooting and throw the markets wide open to\r\nthe sale of game. From first to last, through three long and stormy\r\nmonths, the Destroyers fought with a degree of determination and\r\npersistence worthy of a better cause. They contested with the Defenders\r\nevery inch of ground. In New York, the Destroyers were overwhelmed by\r\nthe tidal wave of Defenders, but in Massachusetts it was a prolonged\r\nhand-to-hand fight on the ramparts. _Five times_ was a bill to repeal\r\nthe spring-shooting law introduced and defeated!\r\n\r\nEven after the bill had passed both houses by good majorities, the\r\nGovernor declared that he could not sign it. And then there poured into\r\nthe Executive offices such a flood of callers, letters, telegrams and\r\ntelephone calls that he became convinced that the People desired the\r\nlaw; so he signed the bill in deference to the wishes of the majority.\r\n\r\nThe principle that the sale of game is wrong, and fatal to the existence\r\nof a supply of game, is as fixed and unassailable as the Rocky\r\nMountains. Its universal acceptance is only a question of intelligence\r\nand common honesty. The open states owe it to themselves and each other\r\nto enact both the spirit and the letter of the Bayne law, _and do it\r\nquickly_, before it is too late to profit by it! Let them remember the\r\nheath hen,--amply protected when entirely too late to save it from\r\nextinction!\r\n\r\nIt is fairly beyond question that the killing of wild game for the\r\nmarket, and its sale in the \"open season\" _and out of it_, is\r\nresponsible for the disappearance of at least fifty per cent of our\r\nstock of American feathered game. It is the market-gunner, the game-hog\r\nwho shoots \"for sport\" and sells his game, and the game dealer, who have\r\nswept away the wild ducks, the ruffed grouse, the quail and the prairie\r\nchickens that thirty years ago were abundant on their natural ranges.\r\nThe foolish farmers of the middle West permitted the market-hunters of\r\nChicago and the East to slaughter their own legitimate game by the\r\nbarrel and the car-load, and ship it \"East,\" to market. To-day the\r\nwaters of Currituck Sound are a wholesale slaughter-place for migratory\r\nwild fowl with which to supply the markets of Baltimore, Washington and\r\nPhiladelphia. Furthermore, the market gunners of Currituck are robbing\r\nthe people of 16 states of tens of thousands of wild-fowl that\r\nlegitimately belong to them, during the annual autumn flight. The\r\naccompanying map shows how it is done.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP USED IN THE CAMPAIGN FOR THE BAYNE LAW\r\nThis map shows how the sale of ducks killed on the Carrituck Sound\r\nrobs the people of 16 states, for the benefit of a few.\r\nSTOP THE SALE OF GAME!\r\n(Signed W.T. Hornaday, March 6, 1911.)]\r\n\r\nTo-day, the cash rewards of the market-hunter who can reach a large city\r\nwith his product are dangerously great. Observe the following\r\n_wholesale_ prices that prevailed in New York city in 1910, just prior\r\nto the passage of the Bayne law. They were compiled and published by\r\nHenry Oldys, of the Biological Survey.\r\n\r\nGrouse, domestic     per pair             $3.00\r\nGrouse, foreign       \"    \"    $1.25  to  1.75\r\nPartridge, domestic   \"    \"     3.50  \"   4.00\r\nWoodcock, domestic    \"    \"     1.50  \"   2.00\r\nGolden plover        per dozen   2.50  \"   3.50\r\nEnglish snipe         \"    \"     2.00  \"   3.00\r\nCanvasback duck      per pair    2.25  \"   3.00\r\nRedhead duck          \"    \"     1.50  \"   2.50\r\nMallard duck          \"    \"           \"   1.25\r\nBluewing teal         \"    \"      .75  \"   1.00\r\nGreenwing teal        \"    \"      .75  \"    .90\r\nBroadbill duck        \"    \"      .50  \"    .75\r\nRail, No. 1          per dozen         \"   1.00\r\nRail, No. 2           \"    \"           \"    .60\r\nVenison, whole deer  per pound    .22  \"    .25\r\nVenison, saddle       \"    \"      .30  \"    .35\r\n\r\nAll our feathered game is rapidly slipping away from us. _Are we going\r\nto save anything from the wreck_? Will we so weakly manage the game\r\nsituation that later on there will be no legitimate bird-shooting for\r\nour younger sons, and our grandsons?\r\n\r\nAll laws that permit the killing of game for the market, and the sale of\r\nit afterward, are class legislation of the worst sort. They permit a\r\nhundred men selfishly to slaughter for their own pockets the game that\r\nrightfully belongs to a hundred thousand men and boys who shoot for the\r\nlegitimate recreation that such field sports afford. Will any of the\r\nsportsmen of America \"stand for\" this until the game is _all_ gone?\r\n\r\nThe people who pay big prices for game in the hotels and restaurants of\r\nour big cities are not men who _need_ that game as food. Far from it.\r\nThey can obtain scores of fine meat dishes without destroying the wild\r\nflocks. In civilized countries wild game is no longer necessary as\r\n\"food,\" to satisfy hunger, and ward off starvation. In the United States\r\nthe day of the hungry Indian-fighting pioneer has gone by and there is\r\nan abundance of food everywhere.\r\n\r\nThe time to temporize and feel timid over the game situation has gone\r\nby. The situation is desperate; and nothing but strong and vigorous\r\nmeasures will avail anything worth while. The sale of all wild game\r\nshould be stopped, everywhere and at all seasons, throughout all North\r\nAmerica, and throughout the world. To-day this particular curse is being\r\nfelt even in India.\r\n\r\nIt is the duty of every true sportsman, every farmer who owns a gun, and\r\nevery lover of wild life, to enter into the campaign for the passage of\r\nbills absolutely prohibiting all traffic in wild game no matter what its\r\norigin. Of course the market hunters, the game-hogs and the game dealers\r\nwill bitterly oppose them, and hire a lobby to attempt to defeat them.\r\nBut the fight for no-sale-of-game is now on, and it must not stop short\r\nof complete victory.\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nREASONS WHY THE SALE OF WILD GAME SHOULD CEASE EVERYWHERE\r\n\r\n  1.--Because fully 95 per cent of our legitimate stock of feathered\r\n  game has already been destroyed.\r\n\r\n  2.--Because if market-gunning and the sale of game continue ten\r\n  years longer, all our feathered game will be swept away.\r\n\r\n  3.--Because when the sale of game was permitted one dealer was able\r\n  to sell 1,000,000 _game birds per year in New York City_, so he\r\n  himself said.\r\n\r\n  4.--Because it is a fixed fact that every wild species of mammal,\r\n  bird or reptile that is pursued for money-making purposes eventually\r\n  is wiped out of existence. Even the whales of the sea are no\r\n  exception.\r\n\r\n  5.--Because at least 50 per cent of the decrease in our feathered\r\n  game is due to market-gunning, and the sale of game. Look at the\r\n  prairie chicken of the Mississippi Valley, and the ruffed grouse of\r\n  New England.\r\n\r\n  6.--Because the laws that permit the commercial slaughter of wild\r\n  birds for the benefit of less than five per cent of the inhabitants\r\n  of any state are directly against the interest of the 95 per cent of\r\n  other people, to _whom that game partly belongs_.\r\n\r\n  7.--Because game killed \"for sale\" is not intended to satisfy\r\n  \"hunger.\" The people who eat game in large cities do not know what\r\n  hunger is, save by hearsay. Purchased game is used chiefly in\r\n  over-feeding; and as a rule it does far more harm than good.\r\n\r\n  8.--Because the greatest value to be derived from any game bird is\r\n  in seeing it, and photographing it, and enjoying its living company\r\n  in its native haunts. Who will love the forests when they become\r\n  destitute of wild life, and desolate?\r\n\r\n  9.--Because stopping the sale of game _will help bring back the game\r\n  birds to us, in a few years_.\r\n\r\n  10.--Because the pace that New York and Massachusetts have set in\r\n  this matter will render it easier to procure the passage of Bayne\r\n  laws in other states.\r\n\r\n  11.--Because those who legitimately desire game for their tables can\r\n  be supplied from the game farms and preserves that now are coming\r\n  into existence.\r\n\r\nWhen New York's far-reaching Bayne bill became a law, the following dead\r\nbirds lay in cold storage in New York City:\r\n\r\nWild duck          98,156\r\nPlover             48,780\r\nQuail              14,227\r\nGrouse             21,202\r\nSnipe               7,825\r\nWoodcock              767\r\nRail                  419\r\n                  -------\r\n                  191,376\r\n\r\nThey represented the last slaughterings of American game for New York.\r\nTo-day the remaining plague-spots are Chicago, Philadelphia, San\r\nFrancisco, Baltimore, Washington and New Orleans; but in New Orleans the\r\nbrakes have at last (1912) been applied, and the market slaughter that\r\nformerly prevailed in that state has at least been checked.\r\n\r\nAs an instance of persistent market shooting on the greatest ducking\r\nwaters of the eastern United States, I offer this report from a\r\ntrustworthy agent sent to Currituck Sound, North Carolina, in March,\r\n1911.\r\n\r\n  I beg to submit the following information relative to the number of\r\n  wild ducks and geese shipped from this market and killed in the\r\n  waters of Back Bay and the upper or north end of Currituck Sound,\r\n  from October 20th to March 1st, inclusive.\r\n\r\n  Approximately there were killed and shipped in the territory above\r\n  named, 130,000 to 135,000 wild ducks and between 1400 and 1500 wild\r\n  geese. From Currituck Sound and its tributaries there were shipped\r\n  approximately 200,000 wild ducks.\r\n\r\n  You will see from the above figures that each year the market\r\n  shooter exacts a tremendous toll from the wild water fowl in these\r\n  waters, and it is only a question of a short time when the wild duck\r\n  will be exterminated, unless we can stop the ruthless slaughter. The\r\n  last few years I have noted a great decrease in the number of wild\r\n  ducks; some of the species are practically extinct. I have secured\r\n  the above information from a most reliable source, and the figures\r\n  given approximately cannot be questioned.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the passage of the Bayne law, closing the greatest\r\nAmerican market against the sale of game was an immediate decrease of\r\nfully fifty per cent in the number of ducks and geese slaughtered on\r\nCurrituck Sound. The dealers refused to buy the birds, and one-half the\r\nkillers were compelled to hang up their guns and go to work. The\r\nduck-slaughterers felt very much enraged by the passage of the law, and\r\nat first were inclined to blame the northern members of Currituck\r\nducking clubs for the passage of the measure; but as a matter of fact,\r\nnot one of the persons blamed took any part whatever in the campaign for\r\nthe new law.\r\n\r\nTHE UNFAIRNESS OF SPRING SHOOTING.--The shooting of game birds in late\r\nwinter and spring is to be mentioned only to be condemned. It is grossly\r\nunfair to the birds, outrageous in principle, and most unsportsmanlike,\r\nno matter whether the law permits it or not. Why it is that any state\r\nlike Iowa, for example, can go on killing game in spring is more than I\r\ncan understand. I have endeavored to find a reason for it, in Iowa, but\r\nthe only real reason is:--\"The boys want the birds!\"\r\n\r\nI think we have at last reached the point where it may truthfully be\r\nsaid that now no gentleman shoots birds in spring. If the plea is made\r\nthat \"if we don't shoot ducks in the spring we can't shoot them at all!\"\r\nthen the answer is--if you can't shoot game like high-minded,\r\nred-blooded sportsman, _don't shoot it at all_! A gentleman can not\r\nafford to barter his standing and his own self-respect for a few ducks\r\nshot in the spring when the birds are going north to lay their eggs. And\r\nthe man who insists on shooting in spring may just as well go right on\r\nand do various other things that are beyond the pale, such as shoot\r\nquail on the ground, shoot does and fawns, and fish for trout with gang\r\nhooks.\r\n\r\nThere are no longer two sides to what once was the spring shooting\r\nquestion. Even among savages, the breeding period of the wild creatures\r\nis under taboo. Then if ever may the beasts and birds cry \"King's\r\nexcuse!\" It has been positively stated in print that high-class fox\r\nhounds have been known to refuse to chase a pregnant fox, even when in\r\nfull view.\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\nBRINGING BACK THE VANISHED BIRDS AND GAME\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most charming trait of wild-life character is the alacrity and\r\nconfidence with which wild birds and mammals respond to the friendly\r\nadvances of human friends. Those who are not very familiar with the\r\nmental traits of our wild neighbors may at first find it difficult to\r\ncomprehend the marvelous celerity with which both birds and mammals\r\nrecognize friendly overtures from man, and respond to them.\r\n\r\nAt the present juncture, this state of the wild-animal mind becomes a\r\nfactor of great importance in determining what we can do to prevent the\r\nextermination of species, and to promote the increase and return of wild\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nI think that there is not a single wild mammal or bird species now\r\nliving that can not, or does not, quickly recognize protection, _and\r\ntake advantage of it_. The most conspicuous of all familiar examples are\r\nthe wild animals of the Yellowstone Park. They embrace the elk, mountain\r\nsheep, antelope, mule deer, the black bear and even the grizzly. No one\r\ncan say precisely how long those several species were in ascertaining\r\nthat it was safe to trust themselves within easy rifle-shot of man; but\r\nI think it was about five years. Birds recognize protection far more\r\nquickly than mammals. In a comparatively short time the naturally wild\r\nand wary big game of the Yellowstone Park became about as tame as range\r\ncattle. It was at least fifteen years ago that the mule deer began to\r\nfrequent the parade ground at the Mammoth Hot Springs military post, and\r\nreceive there their rations of hay.\r\n\r\nWhenever you see a beautiful photograph of a large band of big-horn\r\nsheep or mule deer taken at short range amid Rocky Mountain scenery, you\r\nare safe in labeling it as having come from the Yellowstone Park. The\r\nprong-horned antelope herd is so tame that it is difficult to keep it\r\nout of the streets of Gardiner, on the Montana side of the line.\r\n\r\nBut the bears! Who has not heard the story of the bears of the\r\nYellowstone Park,--how black bears and grizzlies stalk out of the woods,\r\nevery day, to the garbage dumping-ground; how black bears actually have\r\ncome _into the hotels_ for food, without breaking the truce, and how the\r\ngrizzlies boldly raid the grub-wagons and cook-tents of campers, taking\r\njust what they please, because they _know_ that no man dares to shoot\r\nthem! Indeed, those raiding bears long ago became a public nuisance, and\r\nmany of them have been caught in steel box-traps and shipped to\r\nzoological gardens, in order to get them out of the way. And yet,\r\noutside the Park boundaries, everywhere, the bears are as wary and wild\r\nas the wildest.\r\n\r\nThe arrogance of the bears that couldn't be shot once led to a droll\r\nand also exciting episode.\r\n\r\nDuring the period when Mr. C.J. Jones (\"Buffalo\" Jones) was\r\nsuperintendent of the wild animals of the Park, the indignities\r\ninflicted upon tourist campers by certain grizzly bears quite abraded\r\nhis nerves. He obtained from Major Pitcher authority to punish and\r\nreform a certain grizzly, and went about the matter in a thoroughly\r\nBuffalo-Jonesian manner. He procured a strong lariat and a bean-pole\r\nseven feet long and repaired to the camp that was troubled by too much\r\ngrizzly.\r\n\r\nThe particular offender was a full-grown male grizzly who had become a\r\nnotorious raider. At the psychological moment Jones lassoed him in short\r\norder, getting a firm hold on the bear's left hind leg. Quickly the end\r\nof the rope was thrown over a limb of the nearest tree, and in a trice\r\nEphraim found himself swinging head downward between the heavens and the\r\nearth. And then his punishment began.\r\n\r\nBuffalo Jones thrashed him soundly with the bean-pole! The outraged bear\r\nswung to and fro, whirled round and round, clawing and snapping at the\r\nempty air, roaring and bawling with rage, scourged in flesh and insulted\r\nin spirit. As he swung, the bean-pole searched out the different parts\r\nof his anatomy with a wonderful degree of neatness and precision.\r\nBetween rage and indignation the grizzly nearly exploded. A\r\nmoving-picture camera was there, and since that day that truly moving\r\nscene has amazed and thrilled countless thousands of people.\r\n\r\nWhen it was over, Mr. Jones boldly turned the bear loose! Although its\r\nrage was as boundless as the glories of the Yellowstone Park, it paused\r\nnot to rend any of those present, but headed for the tall timber, and\r\nwith many an indignant \"Woof! Woof!\" it plunged in and disappeared. It\r\nwas two or three years before that locality was again troubled by\r\nimpudent grizzly bears.\r\n\r\nAnd what is the mental attitude of _every_ Rocky Mountain black or\r\ngrizzly bear _outside_ of the Yellowstone Park? It is colossal suspicion\r\nof man, perpetual fear, and a clean pair of heels the moment man-scent\r\nor man-sight proclaims the proximity of the Arch Enemy of Wild\r\nCreatures. And yet there are one or two men who tell the American public\r\nthat wild animals do not think, that they do not reason, and are\r\ngoverned only by \"instinct\"!\r\n\r\n\"A little knowledge is a dangerous thing!\"\r\n\r\nTAMING WILD BIRDS.--As incontestable proof of the receptive faculties of\r\nbirds, I will cite the taming of wild birds in the open, by friendly\r\nadvances. There are hundreds, aye, thousands, of men, women, boys and\r\ngirls who could give interesting and valuable personal testimony on this\r\npoint.\r\n\r\nMy friend J. Alden Loring (one of the naturalists of the Roosevelt\r\nAfrican Expedition), is an ardent lover of wild birds and mammals. The\r\ntaming of wild creatures in the open is one of his pastimes, and his\r\nresults serve well to illustrate the marvelous readiness of our wild\r\nneighbors to become close friends with man _when protected_. I will\r\nquote from one of Mr. Loring's letters on this subject:\r\n\r\n\"Taming wild birds is a new field in nature study, and one never can\r\ntell what success he will have until he has experimented with different\r\nspecies. Some birds tame much more easily than others. On three or four\r\noccasions I have enticed a chickadee _to my hand_ at the first attempt,\r\nwhile in other cases it has taken from fifteen minutes to a whole day.\r\n\r\n\"Chipping sparrows that frequent my doorway I have tamed in two days. A\r\nnuthatch required three hours before it would fly to my hand, although\r\nit took food from my stick the first time it was offered. When you find\r\na bird on her nest, it is of course much easier to tame that individual\r\nthan if you had to follow it about in the open, and wait for it to come\r\nwithin reach of a stick. By exercising extreme caution, and approaching\r\ninch by inch, I have climbed a tree to the nest of a yellow-throated\r\nvireo, and at the first attempt handed the bird a meal-worm with my\r\nfingers. At one time I had two house wrens, a yellow-throated vireo, a\r\nchipping sparrow and a flock of chickadees that would come to my hand.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIX WILD CHIPMUNKS DINE WITH MR. LORING]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would be possible--and also delightful--to fill a volume with\r\ncitations of evidence to illustrate the quick acceptance of man's\r\nprotection by wild birds and mammals. Let me draw a few illustrations\r\nfrom my own wild neighbors.\r\n\r\nOn Lake Agassiz, in the N.Y. Zoological Park, within 500 feet of my\r\noffice in the Administration Building, a pair of wild wood-ducks made\r\ntheir nest last spring, and have just finished rearing nine fine,\r\nhealthy young birds. Whenever you see a wood-duck rise and fly in our\r\nPark, you may know that it is a wild bird. During the summer of 1912 a\r\nsmall flock of wild wood-ducks came every night to our Wild-Fowl Pond,\r\nand spent the night there.\r\n\r\nA year ago, a covey of eleven quail appeared in the Park, and have\r\npersistently remained ever since. Last fall and winter they came at\r\nleast twenty times to a spot within forty feet of the rear window of my\r\noffice, in order to feed upon the wheat screenings that we placed there\r\nfor them.\r\n\r\nWhen we first occupied the Zoological Park grounds, in 1899, there was\r\nnot one wild rabbit in the whole 264 acres. Presently the species\r\nappeared, and rabbits began to hop about confidently, all over the\r\nplace. In 1906, we estimated that there were about eighty individuals.\r\nThen the marauding cats began to come in, and they killed off the\r\nrabbits until not one was to be seen. Thereupon, we addressed ourselves\r\nto those cats, in more serious earnest than ever before. Now the cats\r\nhave disappeared; and one day last spring, as I left my office at six\r\no'clock, everyone else having previously gone, I almost stepped upon two\r\nhalf-grown bunnies that had been visiting on the front door-mat.\r\n\r\nWhen we were macadamizing the yards around the Elephant House, with a\r\nthrong of workmen all about every day, a robin made its nest on the\r\nheavy channel-iron frame of one of the large elephant gates that swung\r\nto and fro nearly every day.\r\n\r\nIn 1900 we planted a young pine tree in front of our temporary office\r\nbuilding, within six feet of a main walk; and at once a pair of robins\r\nnested in it and reared young there.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILD CREATURES QUICKLY RESPOND TO FRIENDLY ADVANCES\r\nChickadee and Chipmunk Tamed by Mr. Loring]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE COLORADO OBJECT LESSON IN BRINGING BACK THE DUCKS]\r\n\r\nUp in Putnam County, where for five years deer have been protected, the\r\nexhibitions that are given each year of the supreme confidence of\r\nprotected deer literally astonish the natives. They are almost unafraid\r\nof man and his vehicles, his cattle and his horses, but of course they\r\nare unwilling to be handled. Strangers are astonished; but people who\r\nknow something about the mental attitude of wild animals under\r\nprotection know that it is the natural and inevitable result of _real\r\nprotection_.\r\n\r\nAt Mr. Frank Seaman's summer home in the Catskills, the phoebe birds\r\nnest on the beams under the roof of the porch. At my summer home in the\r\nBerkshires, no sooner was our garage completed than a phoebe built her\r\nnest on the edge of the lintel over the side door; and another built on\r\na drain-pipe over the kitchen door.\r\n\r\nNear Port Jervis, last year a wild ruffed grouse nested and reared a\r\nlarge brood in the garden of Mr. W.I. Mitchell, within _two feet_ of the\r\nfoundation of the house.\r\n\r\nOn the Bull River in the wilds of British Columbia two trappers of my\r\nacquaintance, Mack Norboe and Charlie Smith, once formed a friendship\r\nwith a wild weasel. In a very few visits, the weasel found that it was\r\namong friends, and the trappers' log cabin became its home. I have a\r\nphotograph of it, taken while it posed on the door-sill. The trappers\r\nsaid that often when returning at nightfall from their trap-lines, the\r\nweasel would meet them a hundred yards away on the trail, and follow\r\nthem back to the cabin.\r\n\r\n\"Old Ben,\" the big sea-lion who often landed on the wharf at Avalon,\r\nSanta Catalina, to be fed on fish, was personally known to thousands of\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nAN OBJECT LESSON IN PROTECTION.--A remarkable object lesson in the\r\nrecognition of protection by wild ducks came under my notice in the\r\npages of \"Recreation Magazine\" in June, 1903, when that publication was\r\nedited by G.O. Shields. The article was entitled,--\" A Haven of Refuge,\"\r\nand the place described well deserved the name. It is impossible for me\r\nto impress upon the readers of this volume with sufficient force and\r\nclearness the splendid success that is easily attainable in encouraging\r\nthe return of the birds. The story of the Mosca \"Haven of Refuge\" was so\r\nwell told by Mr. Charles C. Townsend in the publication referred to\r\nabove, that I take pleasure in reproducing it entire.\r\n\r\n  One mile north of the little village of Mosca, Colorado, in San Luis\r\n  valley, lives the family of J.C. Gray. On the Gray ranch there is an\r\n  artesian well which empties into a small pond about 100 feet square.\r\n  This pond is never entirely frozen over and the water emptying\r\n  therein is warm even during the coldest winter.\r\n\r\n  Some five years ago, Mr. Gray secured a few wild-duck eggs, and\r\n  hatched them under a hen. The little ducks were reared and fed on\r\n  the little pond. The following spring they left the place, to return\r\n  in the fall, bringing with them broods of young; also bringing other\r\n  ducks to the home where protection was afforded them, and plenty of\r\n  good feed was provided. Each year since, the ducks have scattered in\r\n  the spring to mate and rear their families, returning again with\r\n  greatly increased numbers in the fall, and again bringing strangers\r\n  to the haven of refuge.\r\n\r\n  I drove out to the ranch November 24, 1902, and found the little\r\n  pond almost black with the birds, and was fortunate enough to secure\r\n  a picture of a part of the pond while the ducks were thickly\r\n  gathered thereon. Ice had formed around the edges, and this ice was\r\n  covered with ducks. The water was also alive with others, which paid\r\n  not the least attention to the party of strangers on the shore.\r\n\r\n  From Mr. Gray I learned that there were some 600 ducks of various\r\n  kinds on the pond at that time, though it was then early for them to\r\n  seek winter quarters. Later in the year, he assured me, there would\r\n  be between 2,000 and 3,000 teal, mallards, canvas-backs, redheads\r\n  and other varieties, all perfectly at home and fearless of danger.\r\n  The family have habitually approached the pond from the house, which\r\n  stands on the south side, and should any person appear on the north\r\n  side of the pond the ducks immediately take fright and flight. Wheat\r\n  was strewn on the ground and in the water, and the ducks waddled\r\n  around us within a few inches of our feet to feed, paying not the\r\n  least attention to us, or to the old house-dog which walked near.\r\n\r\n  Six miles east of the ranch is San Luis lake, to which these ducks\r\n  travel almost daily while the lake is open. When they are at the\r\n  lake it is impossible to approach within gunshot of the then timid\r\n  birds. Some unsympathetic boys and men have learned the habit of the\r\n  birds, and place themselves in hiding along the course of flight to\r\n  and from the lake. Many ducks are shot in this way, but woe to the\r\n  person caught firing a gun on or near the home-pond. When away from\r\n  home, the birds are as other wild-ducks and fail to recognize any\r\n  members of the Gray family. While at home they follow the boys\r\n  around the barn-yard, squawking for feed like so many tame ducks.\r\n\r\n  This is the greatest sight I have ever witnessed, and one that I\r\n  could not believe existed until I had seen it. Certainly it is worth\r\n  travelling many miles to see, and no one, after seeing it, would\r\n  care to shoot birds that, when kindly treated, make such charming\r\n  pets.\r\n\r\nSince the above was published, the protected flocks of tame wild ducks\r\nhave become one of the most interesting sights of Florida. At Palm Beach\r\nthe tameness of the wild ducks when within their protected area, and\r\ntheir wildness outside of it, has been witnessed by thousands of\r\nvisitors.\r\n\r\nTHE SAVING OF THE SNOWY EGRET IN THE UNITED STATES.--The time was when\r\nvery many persons believed that the devastations of the plume-hunters\r\nof Florida and the Gulf Coast would be so long continued and so\r\npersistently followed up to the logical conclusion that both species of\r\nplume-furnishing egrets would disappear from the avifauna of the United\r\nStates. This expectation gave rise to feelings of resentment,\r\nindignation and despair.\r\n\r\nIt happened, however, that almost at the last moment a solitary\r\nindividual set on foot an enterprise calculated to preserve the snowy\r\negret (which is the smaller of the two species involved), from final\r\nextermination. The splendid success that has attended the efforts of Mr.\r\nEdward A. McIlhenny, of Avery Island, Louisiana, is entitled not only to\r\nadmiration and praise, but also to the higher tribute of practical\r\nimitation. Mr. McIlhenny is, first of all, a lover of birds, and a\r\nhumanitarian. He has traveled widely throughout the continent of North\r\nAmerica and elsewhere, and has seen much of wild life and man's\r\ninfluence upon it. To-day his highest ambition is to create for the\r\nbenefit of the Present, and as a heritage to Posterity, a\r\nmid-continental chain of great bird refuges, in which migrating wild\r\nfowl and birds of all other species may find resting-places and refuges\r\nduring their migrations, and protected feeding-grounds in winter. In\r\nthis grand enterprise, the consummation of which is now in progress, Mr.\r\nMcIlhenny is associated with Mr. Charles Willis Ward, joint donor of the\r\nsplendid Ward-McIlhenny Bird Preserve of 13,000 acres, which recently\r\nwas presented to the State of Louisiana by its former owners.\r\n\r\nThe egret and heron preserve, however, is Mr. McIlhenny's individual\r\nenterprise, and really furnished the motif of the larger movement. Of\r\nits inception and development, he has kindly furnished me the following\r\naccount, accompanied by many beautiful photographs of egrets breeding in\r\nsanctuary, one of which appears on page 27.\r\n\r\n  In some recent publications I have seen statements to the effect\r\n  that you believed the egrets were nearing extinction, owing to the\r\n  persecution of plume hunters, so I know that you will be interested\r\n  in the enclosed photographs, which were taken in my heron rookery,\r\n  situated within 100 yards of my factory, where I am now sitting\r\n  dictating this letter.\r\n\r\n  This rookery was started by me in 1896, because I saw at that time\r\n  that the herons of Louisiana were being rapidly exterminated by\r\n  plume hunters. My thought was that the way to preserve them would be\r\n  to start an artificial rookery of them where they could be\r\n  thoroughly protected. With this end in view I built a small pond,\r\n  taking in a wet space that contained a few willows and other shrubs\r\n  which grow in wet places.\r\n\r\n  In a large cage in this pond, I raised some snowy herons. After\r\n  keeping the birds in confinement for something over six months I\r\n  turned them loose, hoping that they would come back the next season,\r\n  as they were perfectly tame and were used to seeing people. I was\r\n  rewarded the next season by four of the birds returning, and nesting\r\n  in the willows in the pond. This was the start of a rookery that now\r\n  covers 35 acres, and contains more than twenty thousand pairs of\r\n  nesting birds, embracing not only the egrets but all the species of\r\n  herons found in Louisiana, besides many other water birds.\r\n\r\n  With a view to carrying on the preservation of our birds on a larger\r\n  scale, Mr. Chas. W. Ward and I have recently donated to the State of\r\n  Louisiana 13,000 acres of what I consider to be the finest wild fowl\r\n  feeding ground on the Louisiana coast, as it contains the only\r\n  gravel beach for 50 miles, and all of the geese within that space\r\n  come daily to this beach for gravel. This territory also produces a\r\n  great amount of natural food for geese and ducks.\r\n\r\nSAVING THE GULLS AND TERNS.--But for the vigorous and long-continued\r\nefforts of the Audubon Societies, I think our coasts would by this time\r\nhave been swept clean of the gulls and terns that now adorn it. Twenty\r\nyears ago the milliners were determined to have them all. The fight for\r\nthem was long, and hotly contested, but the Audubon Societies won. It\r\nwas a great victory, and has yielded results of great value to the\r\ncountry at large. And yet, it was only a small number of persons who\r\nfurnished the money and made the fight which inured to the benefit of\r\nthe millions of American people. Hereafter, whenever you see an American\r\ngull or tern, remind yourself that it was saved to the nation by \"the\r\nAudubon people.\"\r\n\r\nIn times of grave emergency, such as fire, war and scarcity of food, the\r\nwild creatures forget their fear of man, and many times actually\r\nsurrender themselves to his mercy and protection. At such times, hard is\r\nthe heart and low is the code of manly honor that does not respond in a\r\nmanner becoming a superior species.\r\n\r\nThe most pathetic wild-animal situation ever seen in the United States\r\non a large scale is that which for six winters in succession forced\r\nseveral thousand starving elk into the settlement of Jackson Hole,\r\nWyoming, in quest of food at the hands of their natural enemies. The elk\r\nlost all fear, partly because they were not attacked, and they\r\nsurrounded the log-enclosed haystacks, barns and houses, mutely begging\r\nfor food. Previous to the winter of 1911, thousands of weak calves and\r\ncows perished around the haystacks. Mr. S.N. Leek's wonderful pictures\r\ntell a thrilling but very sad story.\r\n\r\nTo the everlasting honor of the people of Jackson Hole, be it recorded\r\nthat they rose like Men to the occasion that confronted them. In 1909\r\nthey gave to the elk herds all the hay that their domestic stock could\r\nspare, not pausing to ascertain whether they ever would be reimbursed\r\nfor it. They just handed it out! The famishing animals literally mobbed\r\nthe hay-wagons. To-day the national government has the situation in\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nIn times of peace and plenty, the people of Jackson Hole take their toll\r\nof the elk herds, but their example during starvation periods is to be\r\ncommended to all men.\r\n\r\nA SLAUGHTER OF RESTORED GAME.--The case of the chamois in Switzerland\r\nteaches the world a valuable lesson in how _not_ to slaughter game that\r\nhas come back to its haunts through protected breeding.\r\n\r\nA few years ago, one of the provinces of Switzerland took note of the\r\nfact that its once-abundant stock of chamois was almost extinct, and\r\nenacted a law by which the remnant was absolutely protected for a long\r\nperiod. During those years of protection, the animals bred and\r\nmultiplied, until finally the original number was almost restored.\r\n\r\nThen,--as always in such cases,--there arose a strong demand for an open\r\nseason; and eventually the government yielded to the pressure of the\r\nhunters, and fixed a date whereon an open season should begin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GULLS AND TERNS OF OUR COASTS, SAVED FROM DESTRUCTION\r\nThese Birds have been Saved and Brought back to us by the Splendid Efforts\r\nof the Audubon Societies, and other Bird-Lovers. But for the Anti-Plumage\r\nLaws, not one Gull or Tern would now Remain on our Atlantic Coast\r\nFrom the \"American Natural History\"]\r\n\r\nDuring the period preceding that fatal date, the living chamois, grown\r\nhalf tame by years of immunity from the guns, were all carefully located\r\nand marked down by those who intended to hunt them. At daybreak on the\r\nfatal day, the onset began. Guns and hunters were everywhere, and the\r\nmountains resounded with the fusillade. Hundreds of chamois were slain,\r\nby hundreds of hunters; and by the close of that fatal \"open season\" the\r\nspecies was more nearly exterminated throughout that region than ever\r\nbefore. Once more those mountains were nice and barren of game.\r\n\r\nLet that bloody and disgraceful episode serve as a warning to Americans\r\nwho are tempted to demand an open season on game that has bred back from\r\nthe verge of extinction. Particularly do we commend it to the notice of\r\nthe people of Colorado who _even now_ are demanding an open season on\r\nthe preserved mountain sheep of that state. The granting of such an open\r\nseason would be a brutal outrage. Those sheep are now so tame and\r\nunsuspicious that the killing of them would be _cold-blooded murder!_\r\n\r\nTHE LOGICAL CONCLUSION.--Within reasonable limits, any partly-destroyed\r\nwild species can be increased and brought back by giving absolute\r\nprotection from harassment and slaughter. When a species is struggling\r\nto recuperate, it deserves to be left _entirely unmolested_ until it is\r\nonce more on safe ground.\r\n\r\nEvery breeding wild animal craves seclusion and entire immunity from\r\nexcitement and all forms of molestation. Nature simply demands this as\r\nher unassailable right. It is my firm belief that any wild species will\r\nbreed in captivity whenever its members are given a degree of seclusion\r\nthat they deem satisfactory.\r\n\r\nWith species that have not been shot down to a point entirely too low,\r\nadequate protection generously long in duration will bring back their\r\nnumbers. If the people of the United States so willed it, we could have\r\nwild white-tailed deer in every state and in every county (save city\r\ncounties) between the Atlantic and the Rocky Mountains. We could easily\r\nhave one thousand bob white quail for every one now living. We could\r\nhave squirrels in every grove, and songbirds by the million,--merely by\r\nprotecting them from slaughter and molestation. From Ohio to the great\r\nplains, the pinnated grouse could be made far more common than crows and\r\nblackbirds.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as all this is true,--and no one with information will dispute\r\nit for a moment,--is it not folly to seek to supplant our own splendid\r\nnative species of game birds (_that we never yet have decently\r\nprotected!_) with foreign species? Let the American people answer this\r\nquestion with \"Yes\" or \"No.\"\r\n\r\nThe methods by which our non-game birds can be encouraged and brought\r\nback are very simple: Protect them, put up shelters for them, give them\r\nnest-boxes in abundance, protect them from cats, dogs, and all other\r\nforms of destruction, and feed those that need to be fed. I should think\r\nthat every boy living in the country would find keen pleasure in making\r\nand erecting nest-boxes for martins, wrens, and squirrels; in putting up\r\nstraw teepees in winter for the quail, in feeding the quail, and in\r\nnailing to the trees chunks of suet and fat pork every winter for the\r\nwoodpeckers, nuthatches, and other winter residents.\r\n\r\nWill any person now on this earth live long enough to see the present\r\nall-pervading and devilish spirit of slaughter so replaced by the love\r\nof wild creatures and the true spirit of conservation that it will be as\r\nrare as it now is common?\r\n\r\nBut let no one think for a moment that any vanishing species can at any\r\ntime be brought back; for that would be a grave error. The point is\r\nalways reached, by every such species, that the survivors are too few to\r\ncope with circumstances, and recovery is impossible. The heath hen could\r\nnot be brought back, neither could the passenger pigeon. The whooping\r\ncrane, the sage grouse, the trumpeter swan, the wild turkey, and the\r\nupland plover never will come back to us, and nothing that we can do\r\never will bring them back. Circumstances are against those species,--and\r\nI fear against many others also. Thanks to the fact that the American\r\nbison breeds well in captivity, we have saved that species from complete\r\nextinction, but our antelope seems to be doomed.\r\n\r\nIt is because of the alarming condition of our best wild life that quick\r\naction and strong action is vitally necessary. We are sleeping on our\r\npossibilities.\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV\r\n\r\nINTRODUCED SPECIES THAT HAVE BEEN BENEFICIAL\r\n\r\n\r\nMan has made numerous experiments in the transplantation of wild species\r\nof mammals and birds from one country, or continent, to another. About\r\none-half these efforts have been beneficial, and the other half have\r\nresulted disastrously.\r\n\r\nThe transplantation of any wild-animal species is a leap in the dark. On\r\ngeneral principles it is dangerous to meddle with the laws of Nature,\r\nand attempt to improve upon the code of the wilderness. Our best wisdom\r\nin such matters may easily prove to be short-sighted folly. The trouble\r\nlies in the fact that concerning transplantation it is _impossible for\r\nus to know beforehand all the conditions that will affect it, or that it\r\nwill effect, and how it will work out_. In its own home a species may\r\n_seem_ not only harmless, but actually beneficial to man. We do not\r\nknow, and _we can not know_, all the influences that keep it in check,\r\nand that mould its character. We do not know, and we can not know\r\nwithout a trial, how new environment will affect it, and what new traits\r\nof character it will develop under radically different conditions. The\r\ngentle dove of Europe may become the tyrant dove of Cathay. The\r\nRepressed Rabbit of the Old World becomes in Australia the\r\nUncontrollable Rabbit, a devastator and a pest of pests.\r\n\r\nNo wild species should be transplanted and set free in a wild state to\r\nstock new regions without consulting men of wisdom, and following their\r\nadvice. It is now against the laws of the United States to introduce and\r\nacclimatize in a wild state, anywhere in the United States, any\r\nwild-bird species without the approval of the Department of Agriculture.\r\nThe law is a wise one. Furthermore, the same principle should apply to\r\nbirds that it is proposed to transplant from one portion of the United\r\nStates into another, especially when the two are widely separated.\r\n\r\nOn this point, I once learned a valuable lesson, which may well point my\r\npresent moral. Incidentally, also, it was a narrow escape for me!\r\n\r\nA gentlemen of my acquaintance, who admires the European magpie, and is\r\nwell aware of its acceptable residence in various countries in Europe,\r\nonce requested my cooperation in securing and acclimatizing at his\r\ncountry estate a number of birds of that species. As in duty bound, I\r\nlaid the matter before our Department of Agriculture, and asked for an\r\nopinion. The Department replied, in effect, \"Why import a foreign magpie\r\nwhen we have in the West a species of our own quite as handsome, and\r\nwhich could more easily be transplanted?\"\r\n\r\nThe point seemed well taken. Now, I had seen much of the American\r\nmagpie in its wild home,--the Rocky Mountains, and the western border\r\nof the Great Plains,--and I _thought_ I was acquainted with it. I knew\r\nthat a few complaints against it had been made, but they had seemed to\r\nme very trivial. To me our magpie seemed to have a generally\r\nunobjectionable record.\r\n\r\nFortunately for me, I wrote to Mr. Hershey, Assistant Curator of\r\nOrnithology in the Colorado State Museum, for assistance in procuring\r\nfifty birds, for transplantation to the State of New York. Mr. Hershey\r\nreplied that if I really wished the birds for acclimatization, he would\r\ngladly procure them for me; but he said that in the _thickly-settled\r\nfarming communities_ of Colorado, the magpie is now regarded as a pest.\r\nIt devours the eggs and nestlings of other wild birds, and not only\r\nthat, it destroys so many eggs of domestic poultry that many farmers are\r\ncompelled to keep their egg-laying hens shut up in wire enclosures!\r\n\r\nNow, this condition happened to be entirely unknown to me, because I\r\nnever had seen the American magpie in action _in a farming community_!\r\nOf course the proposed experiment was promptly abandoned, but it is\r\nembarrassing to think how near I came to making a mistake. Even if the\r\nmagpies had been transplanted and had become a nuisance in this state,\r\nthey could easily have been exterminated by shooting; but the memory of\r\nthe error would have been humiliating to the party of the first part.\r\n\r\nTHE OLD WORLD PHEASANTS IN AMERICA.--In 1881 the first Chinese\r\nring-necked pheasants were introduced into the United States, twelve\r\nmiles below Portland, Oregon; twelve males and three females. The next\r\nyear, Oregon gave pheasants a five-year close season. A little later,\r\nthe golden and silver pheasants of China were introduced, and all three\r\nspecies throve mightily, on the Pacific Coast, in Oregon, Washington and\r\nwestern British Columbia. In 1900, the sportsmen of Portland and\r\nVancouver were shooting cock golden pheasants according to law.\r\n\r\nThe success of Chinese and Japanese pheasants on the Pacific Coast soon\r\nled to experiments in the more progressive states, at state expense.\r\nState pheasant hatcheries have been established in Massachusetts,\r\nConnecticut, New York, New Jersey, Ohio, Illinois, Missouri, Iowa and\r\nCalifornia.\r\n\r\nIn many localities, the old-world pheasants have come to stay. The rise\r\nand progress of the ring-neck in western New York has already been\r\nnoted. It came about merely through protection. That protection was\r\nprotection in fact, not the false \"protection\" that shoots on the sly.\r\nIt is the irony of fate that full protection should be accorded a\r\nforeign bird, in order that it may multiply and possess the land, while\r\nthe same kind of protection is refused the native bob white, and it is\r\nnow almost a dead species, so far as this state is concerned.\r\n\r\nIn looking about for grievances against the ring-necked and English\r\npheasant, some persons have claimed that in winter these birds are\r\n\"budders,\" which means that they harmfully strip trees and bushes of the\r\nbuds that those bushes will surely need in their spring opening. On\r\nthat point Dr. Joseph Kalbfus, Secretary of the Pennsylvania Game\r\nCommission, sent out a circular letter of inquiry, in response to which\r\nhe received many statements. With but one exception, all the testimony\r\nreceived was to the effect that pheasants are _not_ bud-eaters, and that\r\ngenerally the charge is unfounded.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of old-world pheasants, and the attempted introduction\r\nof the Hungarian partridge, are efforts designed first of all to furnish\r\nsportsmen something to shoot, and incidentally to provide a new food\r\nsupply for the table. The people of this country are not starving, nor\r\nare they even very hungry for the meat of strange birds; but as a\r\nfood-producer, the pheasant is all right.\r\n\r\nIt disgusts me to the core, however, to see states that wantonly and\r\nwickedly, through sheer apathy and lack of business enterprise, have\r\nallowed the quail, the heath hen, the pinnated grouse and the ruffed\r\ngrouse to become almost exterminated by extravagant and foolish\r\nshooters, now putting forth wonderfully diligent efforts and spending\r\nmoney without end, in introducing _foreign_ species! Many men actually\r\ntake the ground that our game \"can't live\" in its own country any\r\nlonger; but only the ignorant and the unthinking will say so! Give our\r\ngame birds decent, sensible, _actual_ protection, stop their being\r\nslaughtered far faster than they breed, and _they will live anywhere in\r\ntheir own native haunts_! But where is there _one species_ of upland\r\ngame bird in America that has been sensibly and adequately protected?\r\nFrom Portland, Maine, to Portland, Oregon there is _not one,--not a\r\nsingle locality in which protection from shooting has been sensible, or\r\njust, or adequate_.\r\n\r\nWe have universally given our American upland game birds an unfair deal,\r\nand now we are adding insult to slaughter by bringing in foreign game\r\nbirds to replace them--because our birds \"can't live\" before five\r\nmillion shot-guns!\r\n\r\nOur American game birds CAN live, anywhere in the haunts where nature\r\nplaced them that are not to-day actually occupied by cities and towns!\r\nGive me the making of the laws, and I will make the prairie chicken and\r\nquail as numerous throughout the northern states east of the Great\r\nPlains as domestic chickens are outside the regular poultry farms. There\r\nis only one reason why there are not ten million quail in the state of\r\nNew York to-day,--one for each human inhabitant,--and that reason is the\r\ninfernal greed and selfishness of the men who have almost exterminated\r\nour quail by over-shooting. Don't talk to me about the \"hard winters\"\r\nkilling off our quail! It is the hard cheek of the men who shoot them\r\nwhen they ought to let them alone.\r\n\r\nThe State of Iowa could support 500,000 prairie chickens and never miss\r\nthe waste grain that they would glean in the fields; but now the prairie\r\nchicken is practically extinct in Iowa, only a few scattered specimens\r\nremaining as \"last survivors\" in some of the northern counties. The\r\nmigration of those birds that unexpectedly came down from the north last\r\nwinter was like the fall of a meteor,--only the birds promptly faded\r\naway again. Why should New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts\r\nexterminate the heath hen and coddle the ring-necked pheasant and the\r\nHungarian partridge?\r\n\r\nThe introduction of the old-world pheasants interests me very little.\r\nEvery one that I see is a painful reminder of our slaughtered quail and\r\ngrouse,--the birds that never have had a square deal from the American\r\npeople! Thus far the introduction of the Hungarian partridge has not\r\nbeen successful, anywhere. Connecticut, Missouri, New Jersey and I think\r\nother states have tried this, and failed. The failure of that species\r\nbrings no sorrow to me. I prefer our own game birds; and if the American\r\npeople will not conserve those properly and decently they deserve to\r\nhave no game birds.\r\n\r\nTHE EUROPEAN RED DEER IN NEW ZEALAND.--Occasionally a gameless land\r\nmakes a ten-strike by introducing a foreign game animal that does no\r\nharm, and becomes of great value. The greatest success ever made in the\r\ntransplantation of game animals has been in New Zealand.\r\n\r\nOriginally, New Zealand possessed no large animals, and no \"big-game.\"\r\nWhen Nature passed around the deer, antelopes, sheep, goats, wild cattle\r\nand bears, New Zealand failed to receive her share. For centuries her\r\nsplendid forests, her grand mountains and picturesque valleys remained\r\nuntenanted by big game.\r\n\r\nIn 1864, the Prince Consort of England caused seven head of European red\r\ndeer to be taken from the royal park at Windsor, and sent to\r\nChristchurch, New Zealand. Only three of the animals survived the long\r\nvoyage; a buck and two does. For several weeks the two were kept in a\r\nbarn in Christchurch, where they served no good purpose, and were not\r\nlikely to live long or be happy. Finally some one said, \"Let's set them\r\nfree in the mountains!\"\r\n\r\nThe idea was adopted. The three animals were hauled an uncertain number\r\nof miles into the interior mountains and set free.\r\n\r\nThey promptly settled down in their new home. They began to breed, and\r\nnow on the North Island there are probably five thousand European red\r\ndeer, every one of which has descended directly from the famous three!\r\nAnd here is the strangest part of the story:\r\n\r\nThe red deer of the North Island represent the greatest case of\r\nin-and-in breeding of wild animals on record. According to the\r\nexperience of the world in the breeding of domestic cattle (_not\r\nhorses_), we should expect physical deterioration, the development of\r\ndiseases, and disaster. On the contrary, the usual evil results of\r\nin-breeding in domestic cattle have been totally absent. _The red deer\r\nof New Zealand are to-day physically larger and more robust animals,\r\nwith longer and heavier antlers, and longer hair, than any of the red\r\ndeer of Europe west of Germany_!\r\n\r\nRed deer have been introduced practically all over New Zealand, and the\r\ntotal number now in the Islands must be somewhere near forty thousand.\r\nThe sportsmen of that country have grand sport, and take many splendid\r\ntrophies. That transplantation has been a very great success.\r\nIncidentally, the case of the in-bred deer of the North Island, taken\r\nalong with other cases of which we know, establishes a new and important\r\nprinciple in evolution. It is this:\r\n\r\n_When healthy wild animals are established in a state of nature, either\r\nabsolutely free, or confined in preserves so large that they roam at\r\nwill, seek the food of nature and take care of themselves, in-and-in\r\nbreeding produces no ill effects, and ceases to be a factor. The animals\r\ndevelop in physical perfection according to the climate and their food\r\nsupply; and the introduction of new blood is not necessary_.\r\n\r\nTHE FALLOW DEER ON THE ISLAND OF LAMBAY.--In the Irish Sea, a few miles\r\nfrom the southeast coast of Ireland, is the Island of Lambay, owned by\r\nCecil Baring, Esq. The island is precisely one square mile in area, and\r\nsome of its sea frontage terminates in perpendicular cliffs. In many\r\nways the island is of unusual interest to zoologists, and its fauna has\r\nbeen well set forth by Mr. Baring.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1892 three fallow deer (_Dama vulgaris_) a buck and two\r\ndoes, were transplanted from a park on the Irish mainland to Lambay, and\r\nthere set free. From that slender stock has sprung a large herd, which,\r\nbut for the many deer that have been purposely shot, and the really\r\nconsiderable number that have been killed by going over the cliffs in\r\nstormy weather, the progeny of the original three would to-day number\r\nseveral hundred head. No new blood has been introduced, and _no deer\r\nhave died of disease_. Even counting out the losses by the rifle and by\r\naccidental death, the herd to-day numbers more than one hundred head.\r\n\r\nMr. Baring declares that neither he nor his gamekeeper have ever been\r\nable to discover any deterioration in the deer of Lambay, either in\r\nsize, weight, size of antlers, fertility or general physical stamina.\r\nThe deterioration through disease, especially tuberculosis, that always\r\nis dreaded and often observed in closely in-bred domestic cattle, has\r\nbeen totally absent.\r\n\r\nIn looking about for wild species that have been transplanted, and that\r\nhave thriven and become beneficial to man, there seems to be mighty\r\nlittle game in sight! The vast majority belong in the next chapter. We\r\nwill venture to mention the bob white quail that were introduced into\r\nUtah in 1871, into Idaho in 1875, and the California valley quail in\r\nWashington in 1857. Wherever these efforts have succeeded, the results\r\nhave been beneficial to man.\r\n\r\nIn 1879 a well-organized effort was made to introduce European quail\r\ninto several of the New England and Middle States,--to take the place of\r\nthe bob white, we may suppose,--the bird that \"can't stand the winters!\"\r\nAbout three thousand birds were distributed and set free,--and went down\r\nand out, just as might have been expected. During the past twenty years\r\nit is safe to say that not less than $500,000 have been expended in the\r\nnorthern states, and particularly in the northeastern states, in\r\nimporting live quail from Kansas, the Indian Territory, Oklahoma, Texas,\r\nthe Carolinas and other southern states, for restocking areas from which\r\nthe northern bob white had been exterminated by foolish over-shooting! I\r\nthink that fully nine-tenths of these efforts have ended in total\r\nfailure. The quail could not survive in their strange environment. I\r\ncannot recall a _single instance_ in which restocking northern covers\r\nwith southern quail has been a success.\r\n\r\nThere is no royal road to the restoration of an exterminated bird\r\nspecies. Where the native seed still exists, by long labor and travail,\r\nthorough protection and a mighty long close season, it can be encouraged\r\nto _breed back and return_; but it is an evolution that can not be\r\nhurried in the least. Protect Nature, and leave the rest to her.\r\n\r\nWith mammals, the case is different. It is possible to restock depleted\r\nareas, provided Time is recognized as a dominant factor. I can cite two\r\ninteresting cases by way of illustration, but this subject will form\r\nanother chapter.\r\n\r\nIn the transplantation of fishes, conditions are widely different, and\r\nmany notable successes have been achieved.\r\n\r\n  One of the greatest hits ever made by the United States Bureau of\r\n  Fisheries in the planting of fish in new localities was the\r\n  introduction of the striped bass or rock-fish (_Roccus lineatus_) of\r\n  our Atlantic coast, into the coast waters of California. In 1879,\r\n  135 live fish were deposited in Karquines Strait, at Martinez, and\r\n  in 1882, 300 more were planted in Suisun Bay, near the first\r\n  locality chosen.\r\n\r\n  Twelve years after the first planting in San Francisco Bay, the\r\n  markets of San Francisco handled 149,997 pounds of striped bass. At\r\n  that time the average weight for a whole year was eleven pounds, and\r\n  the average price was ten cents per pound. Fish weighing as high as\r\n  forty-nine pounds have been taken, and there are reasons for the\r\n  belief that eventually the fish of California will attain as great\r\n  weight as those of the Atlantic and the Gulf.\r\n\r\n  The San Francisco markets now sell, annually, about one and one half\r\n  million pounds of striped bass. This fish has taken its place among\r\n  anglers as one of the game fishes of the California coast, and\r\n  affords fine sport. Strange to say, however, it has not yet spread\r\n  beyond the shores of California.\r\n\r\n  Regarding this species, the records of the United States Bureau of\r\n  Fisheries are of interest. In 1897, the California markets handled\r\n  2,949,642 pounds, worth $225,527.--(American Natural History.)\r\n\r\nNowhere else in the world, we venture to say, were such extensive,\r\ncostly and persistent efforts put forth in the transplantation of any\r\nwild foreign species as the old U.S. Fish Commission, under Prof.\r\nSpencer F. Baird, put forth in the introduction of the German carp into\r\nthe fresh water ponds, lakes and rivers of the United States. It was\r\nheld that because the carp could live and thrive in waters bottomed with\r\nmud, that species would be a boon to all inland regions where bodies of\r\nwater, or streams, were scarce and dear. Although the carp is not the\r\nbest fish in the world for the table, it seemed that the dwellers in the\r\nprairie and great plains regions would find it far better than\r\nbullheads, or no fish at all,--which are about the same thing.\r\n\r\nBy means of special fish cars, sent literally all over the United\r\nStates, at a great total expense, live carp, hatched in the ponds near\r\nthe Washington Monument were distributed to all applicants. The German\r\ncarp spread far and wide; but to-day I think the fish has about as many\r\nenemies as friends. In some places, strong objections have been filed to\r\nthe manner in which carp stir up the mud at the bottom of ponds and\r\nsmall lakes, greatly to the detriment of all the native fishes found\r\ntherein.\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV\r\n\r\nINTRODUCED SPECIES THAT HAVE BECOME PESTS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe man who successfully transplants or \"introduces\" into a new habitat\r\nany persistent species of living thing, assumes a very grave\r\nresponsibility. Every introduced species is doubtful gravel until panned\r\nout. The enormous losses that have been inflicted upon the world through\r\nthe perpetuation of follies with wild vertebrates and insects would, if\r\nadded together, be enough to purchase a principality. The most\r\naggravating feature of these follies in transplantation is that never\r\nyet have they been made severely punishable. We are just as careless and\r\neasy-going on this point as we were about the government of the\r\nYellowstone Park in the days when Howell and other poachers destroyed\r\nour first national bison herd, and when caught red-handed--as Howell\r\nwas, skinning seven Park bison cows,--_could not be punished for it,\r\nbecause there was no penalty prescribed by any law_.\r\n\r\nTo-day, there is a way in which any revengeful person could inflict\r\nenormous damage on the entire South, at no cost to himself, involve\r\nthose states in enormous losses and the expenditure of vast sums of\r\nmoney, yet go absolutely unpunished!\r\n\r\nTHE GYPSY MOTH is a case in point. This winged calamity was imported at\r\nMaiden, Massachusetts, near Boston, by a French entomologist, Mr.\r\nLeopold Trouvelot, in 1868 or '69. History records the fact that the man\r\nof science did not purposely set free the pest. He was endeavoring with\r\nlive specimens to find a moth that would produce a cocoon of commercial\r\nvalue to America; and a sudden gust of wind blew out of his study,\r\nthrough an open window, his living and breeding specimens of the gypsy\r\nmoth. The moth itself is not bad to look at, but its larvae is a great,\r\novergrown brute, with an appetite like a hog. Immediately Mr. Trouvelot\r\nsought to recover his specimens, and when he failed to find them all.\r\nlike a man of real honor, he notified the State authorities of the\r\naccident. Every effort was made to recover all the specimens, but enough\r\nescaped to produce progeny that soon became a scourge to the trees of\r\nMassachusetts. The method of the big, nasty-looking mottled-brown\r\ncaterpillar was very simple. It devoured the entire foliage of every\r\ntree that grew in its sphere of influence.\r\n\r\nThe gypsy moth spread with alarming rapidity and persistence. In course\r\nof time the state authorities of Massachuestts were forced to begin a\r\nrelentless war upon it, by poisonous sprays and by fire. It was awful!\r\nUp to this date (1912) the New England states and the United States\r\nGovernment service have expended in fighting this pest about $7,680,000!\r\n\r\nThe spread of this pest has been retarded, but the gypsy moth never\r\nwill be wholly stamped out. To-day it exists in Rhode Island,\r\nConnecticut and New Hampshire, and it is due to reach New York at an\r\nearly date. It is steadily spreading in three directions from Boston,\r\nits original point of departure, and when it strikes the State of New\r\nYork, we, too, will begin to pay dearly for the Trouvclot experiment. It\r\nis said that General S.C. Lawrence, of Medford, Massachusetts, has spent\r\n$75,000 in trying to protect his trees from the ravages of this scourge.\r\n\r\nTHE RABBIT PLAGUE IN AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND.--The rabbit curse upon\r\nAustralia and New Zealand is so well known as to require little comment.\r\nIn this case the introduction was deliberate. In the days when the sheep\r\nindustry was most prosperous, a patriotic gentleman conceived the idea\r\nthat the introduction of the rabbit, and its establishment as a wild\r\nanimal, would be a good thing. He reasoned that it would furnish a good\r\nfood supply, that it would furnish sport, and being unable to harm any\r\nother creature of flesh and blood it was therefore harmless.\r\nAccordingly, three pairs of rabbits were imported and set free.\r\n\r\nIn a short time, the immense number of rabbits that began to overrun the\r\ncountry furnished food for reflection, as well as for the table. A very\r\nsimple calculation brought out the startling information that, under\r\nperfectly favorable conditions, a single pair of rabbits could in three\r\nyears' time produce progeny amounting to 13,718,000 individuals. Ever\r\nsince that time, in discussing the rabbits of Australia it has been\r\nnecessary to speak in millions.\r\n\r\n\"The inhabitants of the colony,\" says Dr. Richard Lydekker, \"soon found\r\nthat the rabbits were a plague, for they devoured the grass, which was\r\nneeded for the sheep, the bark of trees, and every kind of fruit and\r\nvegetable, until the prospects of the colony became a very serious\r\nmatter, and ruin seemed inevitable. In New South Wales upwards of\r\n15,000,000 rabbits skins have been exported in a single year; while in\r\nthirteen years ending with 1889 no less than 39,000,000 were accounted\r\nfor in Victoria alone.\r\n\r\n\"To prevent the increase of these rodents, the introduction of weasels,\r\nstoats, mongooses, etc., has been tried; but it has been found that\r\nthose carnivores neglected the rabbits and took to feeding on poultry,\r\nand thus became as great a nuisance as the animals they were intended to\r\ndestroy. The attempt to kill them off by the introduction of an epidemic\r\ndisease has also failed. In order to protect such portions of the\r\ncountry as are still free from rabbits, fences of wire netting have been\r\nerected; one of these fences erected by the Government of Victoria\r\nextending for a distance of upwards of one hundred and fifty\r\ngeographical miles. In New Zealand, where the rabbit has been introduced\r\nlittle more than twenty years, its increase has been so enormous, and\r\nthe destruction it inflicts so great, that in some districts it has\r\nactually been a question whether the colonists should not vacate the\r\ncountry rather than attempt to fight against the plague. The average\r\nnumber of rabbit skins exported from New Zealand is now twelve\r\nmillions.\"--(Royal Natural History.)\r\n\r\nTHE FOX PEST IN AUSTRALIA.--And now unfortunate Australia has a new\r\npest, also acquired by importation of an alien species. It is the\r\nEuropean fox (_Vulpes vulpes_). The only redeeming feature about this\r\nfresh calamity is found in the fact that the species was not\r\ndeliberately introduced into Australia for the benefit of the local\r\nfauna. Mr. O.W. Rosenhain, of Melbourne, informs me (1912) that about\r\nthirty years ago the Hunt Club brought to Australia about twenty foxes,\r\nfor the promotion of the noble sport of fox hunting. In some untoward\r\nmanner, the most of those animals escaped. They survived, multiplied,\r\nand have provided New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia with a\r\nfox pest of the first rank.\r\n\r\nThe destruction of wild bird life and poultry has become so serious that\r\nAustralia now is making vigorous efforts to exterminate the pest. The\r\ngovernment pays ten shillings bounty on fox scalps, besides which each\r\nprime fox skin is worth from four to five dollars. It is hoped that\r\nthese combined values will eliminate the fox pest.\r\n\r\nRegarding foxes in Australia, Mr. W.H.D. Le Souef has this to say in his\r\nextremely interesting and valuable book, \"Wild Life in Australia,\" page\r\n146:\r\n\r\n\"We found that foxes were unfortunately plentiful in this district, and\r\nin a hollow log that served to shelter some cubs were noticed the\r\nremains of ducks, fowls, rabbits, lambs, bandicoots and snakes; so they\r\nevidently vary their fare, snakes even not coming amiss. They also sneak\r\non wild ducks that are nesting by the edge of the water among the rushes\r\nand tussocky grass, and catch quail also, especially sitting birds.\r\n_These animals are, and always will be, a great source of trouble in the\r\nthickly timbered country and stony ranges, and will gradually, like the\r\nrabbit, extend all over Australia_. They are evidently not contented\r\nwith ground game only, as Mr. A.F. Kelly, of Barwonleigh, in Victoria,\r\nstates: \"When riding past a bull-oak tree about twenty-five feet high,\r\nwith either a magpie's or crow's nest on top. I noticed the nest looked\r\nvery bulky, and had something red in it. On going nearer I saw a large\r\nfox coiled up in it!\"\r\n\r\nTHE MONGOOSE.--Circumstances alter cases, and a change of environment\r\nsometimes works marvelous changes in the character of an animal species.\r\nNow, _why_ should not the gray Indian mongoose (formerly called the\r\nichneumon, _(Herpestes griscus_)) destroy poultry in India, as it does\r\nelsewhere? There is poultry in plenty to be destroyed, but\r\n\"Rikki-Tikki-Tavi\" elects to specialize on the killing of rats, and\r\ncobras, and other snakes.\r\n\r\nIn his own sphere of influence,--India and the orient,--the mongoose is\r\na fairly decent citizen, and he fits into the time-worn economy of that\r\nregion. As a destroyer of the thrice-anathema domestic rat, he has no\r\nequal in the domain of flesh and blood. His temper is so fierce that one\r\n\"pet\" mongoose has been known to kill a full grown male giant bustard,\r\nand put a greyhound to flight.\r\n\r\nIn an evil moment (1872) Mr. W.B. Espeut conceived the idea that it\r\nwould be a good thing to introduce mongooses to the rats of Barbadoes\r\nand Jamaica that were pestering the cane-fields to an annoying extent.\r\nIt was done. The mongooses attacked the rats, cleaned them out,\r\nmultiplied, and then looked about for more worlds to conquer. Snakes and\r\nlizards were few; but they cheerfully killed and devoured all there\r\nwere. Then, being continuously hungry, they attacked the wild birds and\r\npoultry, indiscriminately, and with their usual vigor. I have been told\r\nthat in Barbadoes \"they cleaned out every living thing that they could\r\ncatch and kill, and then they attacked the sugar-cane.\" The last count\r\nin the indictment may seem hard to believe; but it is a fact that the\r\nIndian mongoose often resorts to fruit and vegetable food.\r\n\r\nIn Jamaica, at the end of the rat-killing period, the planters joyfully\r\nestimated that the labors of Herpestes had saved between 500,000 pounds\r\nand 750,000 pounds to the industries of that island. That was before the\r\nslaughter of wild birds and poultry began. I am told that up to date the\r\ndamage done by the mongoose far exceeds the value of the benefit it once\r\nconferred, but the total has not been computed.\r\n\r\nUp to this date, the mongoose has invaded and become a destructive pest\r\nin Barbadoes, Jamaica, Cuba, St. Vincent, St. Lucia, Trinidad, Nevis,\r\nFiji and all the larger islands of the Hawaiian group. It would require\r\nmany pages to contain a full account of each introduction, awakening,\r\nreckoning of damages and payment of bounties for destruction that the\r\nfiendish mongoose has wrought out wherever it has been introduced. The\r\nprogress of the pest is everywhere the same,--sweeping destruction of\r\nrats, snakes, wild birds, small mammals, and finally poultry and\r\nvegetables.\r\n\r\nEvery country that now is without the mongoose will do well to shut and\r\nguard diligently all the doors by which it might be introduced.\r\n\r\nThroughout its range in the western hemisphere, the mongoose is a pest;\r\nand the Biological Survey of the Department of Agriculture has done well\r\nin securing the enactment of a law peremptorily prohibiting the\r\nimportation of any animals of that species into the United States or any\r\nof its colonies. The fierce temper, indomitable courage and vaulting\r\nappetite of the mongoose would make its actual introduction in any of\r\nthe warm portions of the United States a horrible calamity. In the\r\nsouthern states, and all along the Pacific slope clear up to Seattle, it\r\ncould live, thrive and multiply; and the slaughter that it could and\r\nwould inflict upon our wild birds generally, especially all those that\r\nnest and live on the ground, saying nothing of the slaughter of poultry,\r\nwould drive the American people crazy.\r\n\r\nFancy an animal with the murderous ferocity of a mink, the agility of a\r\nsquirrel, the penetration of a ferret and the cunning of a rat,\r\ninfesting the thickets and barnyards of this country. The mongoose can\r\nlive wherever a rat can live, provided it can get a fair amount of\r\nanimal food. Not for $1,000,000 could any one of the southern or Pacific\r\nstates afford to have a pair of these little gray fiends imported and\r\nset free. If such a calamity ever occurs, all wheels should stop, and\r\nevery habitant should turn out and hunt for the animals until they are\r\nfound and pulverized. No matter if it should require a thousand men and\r\n$100,000, _find them!_ If not found, the cost to the state will soon be\r\na million a year, with no ending.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the vigilance of our custom house officers, every now and\r\nthen a Hindoo from some foreign vessel sneaks into the country with a\r\npet mongoose (and they do make great pets!) inside his shirt, or in the\r\nbottom of a bag of clothing. Of course, whenever the Department of\r\nAgriculture discovers any of these surreptitious animals, they are at\r\nonce confiscated, and either killed or sent to a public zoological park\r\nfor safe-keeping. In New York, the director of the Zoological Park is so\r\ngenuinely concerned about the possibility of the escape of a female\r\nmongoose that he has issued two standing orders: All live mongooses\r\noffered to us shall at once be purchased, and every female animal shall\r\nimmediately be chloroformed.\r\n\r\nIf _Herpestes griseus_ ever breaks loose in the United States, the crime\r\nshall not justly be chargeable to us.\r\n\r\nTHE ENGLISH SPARROW.--In the United States, the English sparrow is a\r\nnational sorrow, almost too great to be endured. It is a bird of plain\r\nplumage, low tastes, impudent disposition and persistent fertility.\r\nContinually does it crowd out its betters, or pugnaciously drive them\r\naway, and except on very rare occasions it eats neither insects nor weed\r\nseeds. It has no song, and in habits it is a bird of the street and the\r\ngutter. There is not one good reason why it should exist in this\r\ncountry. If it were out of the way, our native insect-eaters of song and\r\nbeauty could return to our lawns and orchards. The English sparrow is a\r\nnuisance and a pest, and if it could be returned to the land of its\r\nnativity we would gain much.\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI\r\n\r\nNATIONAL AND STATE GAME PRESERVES, AND BIRD REFUGES\r\n\r\n\r\nOut West, there is said to be a \"feeling\" that game and forest\r\nconservation has \"gone far enough.\" In Montana, particularly, the\r\nNational Wool-Growers' Association has for some time been firmly\r\nconvinced that \"the time has come to call a halt.\" Oh, yes! A halt on\r\nthe conservation of game and forests; but not on the free grazing of\r\nsheep on the public domain. No, not even while those same sheep are\r\nbusily growing wool that is so fearfully and wonderfully conserved by a\r\nsky-high tariff that the truly poor Americans are forced to wear\r\ngarments made of shoddy because they cannot afford to buy clothing made\r\nof wool! (This is the testimony of a responsible clothing merchant, in\r\n1912.)\r\n\r\nWe can readily understand the new hue and cry against conservation that\r\nthe sheep men now are raising. Of course they are against all new game\r\nand forest reserves,--unless the woolly hordes are given the right to\r\ngraze in them!\r\n\r\nMany men of the Great West,--the West beyond the Great Plains,--are\r\nafflicted with a desire to do as they please with the natural resources\r\nof that region. That is the great curse that to-day rests upon our game.\r\nWhen the nearest game warden is 50 miles away, and big game is only 5\r\nmiles away, it is time for that game to take to the tall timber.\r\n\r\nBut in the West, and East and South, there are many men and women who\r\nbelieve in reasonable conservation, and deplore destruction. We have not\r\nby any means reached the point where we can think of stopping in the\r\nmaking of game preserves, or forest preserves. Of the former, we have\r\nscarcely begun to make. The majority of the states of our Union know of\r\n_state_ game preserves only by hearsay. But the time is coming when the\r\nstates will come forward, and perform the serious duty that they neglect\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\nLet the statesmen of America be not afraid of making too many game\r\npreserves! For the next year, one per day would be none too many!\r\nRemember, that on one hand we have the Army of Destruction, and on the\r\nother the expectant millions of Posterity. No executor or trustee ever\r\nerred in safeguarding an estate too carefully. Fifty years hence, if\r\nyour successors and mine find that too much land has been set aside for\r\nthe good of the people, they can mighty easily restore any surplus to\r\nthe public domain, and at a vastly increased valuation. Give Posterity\r\nat least _one_ chance to debate the question: \"Were our forefathers too\r\nliberal in the making of game and forest reserves?\"\r\n\r\nWe can always carve up any useless surplus of the public domain, and\r\nrestore it to commercial uses; but none of the men of to-day will live\r\nlong enough to see so strange a proceeding carried into effect.\r\n\r\nThe game preserves of the United States government are so small (with\r\nthe exception of the Yellowstone and Glacier Parks), that very few\r\npeople ever hear of them, and fewer still know of them in detail. It\r\nseems to be quite time that they should be set forth categorically; and\r\nit is most earnestly to be hoped that this list soon will be doubled.\r\n\r\nTHE YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK.--This was the first of the national parks\r\nand game preserves of the United States. Some of our game preserves are\r\nnot exactly national parks, but this is both, by Act of Congress.\r\n\r\nIt is 62 miles long from north to south, 54 miles wide and contains a\r\ntotal area of 3,348 square miles, or 2,142,720 acres. Its western border\r\nlies in Idaho, and along its northern border a narrow strip lies in\r\nMontana. It is under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of the Interior,\r\nand it is guarded by a detachment of cavalry from the United States\r\nArmy. The Superintendent is now a commissioned officer of the United\r\nStates Army. The business of protecting the game is performed partly by\r\nfour scouts, who are civilians specially engaged for that purpose, but\r\nthe number has always been totally inadequate to the work to be\r\nperformed.\r\n\r\nAt least one-half of the public interest attaching to the Yellowstone\r\nPark is based upon its wild animals. There, the average visitor sees,\r\nfor the first time, wild mountain sheep, antelope, mule deer, elk,\r\ngrizzly bears and white pelicans, roaming free. But for the tragedy of\r\nthe Park bison herd,--slaughtered by poachers from 1890 to 1893, from\r\n300 head down to 30--visitors would see wild bison also; but now the few\r\nwild bison remaining keep as far as possible from the routes of tourist\r\ntravel. The bison were slaughtered through an inadequate protective\r\nforce, and (then) utterly inadequate laws.\r\n\r\nLieut.-Col. L.M. Brett, U.S.A., Superintendent of the Yellowstone Park\r\nadvises me (July 29, 1912) that the wild big game in the Yellowstone\r\nPark in the summer of 1912, is as shown below, based on actual counts\r\nand estimates of the Park scouts, and particularly Scout McBride. \"The\r\nestimates of buffalo, elk, antelope, deer, sheep and bear are based on\r\nactual counts, or very close observations, and are pretty nearly\r\ncorrect.\" (Col. Brett).\r\n\r\n  Wild Buffalo        49\r\n  Moose              550\r\n  Elk (in summer) 35,000\r\n  Antelope           500\r\n  Mountain Sheep     210\r\n  Mule Deer          400\r\n  White-tailed Deer  100\r\n  Grizzly Bears       50\r\n  Black Bears        100\r\n  Pumas              100\r\n  Gray Wolves       none\r\n  Coyotes            400\r\n  Pelicans         1,000\r\n\r\nThe actual count of 49 wild bison in the Park, 10 of which are calves of\r\n1912, will be to all friends of the bison a delightful surprise.\r\nHeretofore the little band had seemed to be stationary, which if true\r\nwould soon mean a decline.\r\n\r\nThe history of the wild game of the Yellowstone Park is blackened by two\r\noccurrences, and one existing fact. The fact is: the town of Gardiner is\r\nsituated on the northern boundary of the Park, in the State of Montana.\r\nIn Gardiner there are a number of men, armed with rifles, who toward\r\ngame have the gray-wolf quality of mercy.\r\n\r\nThe first stain is the massacre of the 270 wild bison for their heads\r\nand robes, already noted. The second blot is the equally savage\r\nslaughter in the early winter of 1911, by some of the people of\r\nGardiner, reinforced by so-called sportsmen from other parts of the\r\nstate, of all the park elk they could kill,--bulls, cows and\r\ncalves,--because a large band wandered across the line into the shambles\r\nof Gardiner, on Buffalo Flats.\r\n\r\nIf the people of Gardiner can not refrain from slaughtering the game of\r\nthe Park--the very animals annually seen by 20,000 visitors to the\r\nPark,--then it is time for the American people to summon the town of\r\nGardiner before the bar of public opinion, to show cause why the town\r\nshould not be wiped off the map.\r\n\r\nThe 35,000 elk that summer in the Park are compelled in winter to\r\nmigrate to lower altitudes in order to find grass that is not under two\r\nfeet of snow. In the winter of 1911-12, possibly 5,000 went south, into\r\nJackson Hole, and 3,000 went northward into Montana. The sheep-grazing\r\nnorth of the Park, and the general settlement by ranchmen of Jackson\r\nHole, have deprived the elk herds of those regions of their natural\r\nfood. For several years past, up to and including the winter of 1910-11,\r\nsome thousands of weak and immature elk have perished in the Jackson\r\nHole country, from starvation and exposure. The ranchmen of that region\r\nhave had terrible times,--in witnessing the sufferings of thousands of\r\nelk tamed by hunger, and begging in piteous dumb show for the small and\r\nall-too-few haystacks of the ranchmen.\r\n\r\nThe people of Jackson Hole, headed by S.N. Leek, the famous photographer\r\nand lecturer on those elk herds, have done all that they could do in the\r\npremises. The spirit manifested by them has been the exact reverse of\r\nthat manifested in Gardiner. To their everlasting credit, they have kept\r\ndomestic sheep out of the Jackson Valley,--by giving the owners of\r\ninvading herds \"hours\" in which to get their sheep \"all out, and over\r\nthe western range.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1909, the State of Wyoming spent in feeding starving elk     $5,000\r\nIn 1911, the State of Wyoming spent in feeding starving elk      5,000\r\nIn 1911, the U.S. Government appropriated for feeding starving elk,\r\nand exporting elk                                              $20,000\r\nIn 1912, the Camp-Fire Club of Detroit gave, for feeding hungry elk\r\n                                                                   100\r\nIn 1910-11, about 3,000 elk perished in Jackson Hole\r\nIn 1911-12, Mr. Leek's photographs of the elk herds showed an alarming\r\nabsence of mature bulls, indicating that now the most of the breeding is\r\ndone by immature males. This means the sure deterioration of the species.\r\n\r\nThe prompt manner in which Congress responded in the late winter of 1911\r\nto a distress call in behalf of the starving elk, is beyond all ordinary\r\nterms of praise. It was magnificent. In fear and trembling, Congress was\r\nasked, through Senator Lodge, to appropriate $5,000. Congress and\r\nSenator Lodge made it $20,000; and for the first time the legislature of\r\nWyoming appealed for national aid to save the joint-stock herds of\r\nWyoming and the Yellowstone Park.\r\n\r\nGLACIER PARK, MONTANA.--In the wild and picturesque mountains of\r\nnorthwestern Montana, covering both sides of the great Continental\r\nDivide, there is a region that has been splendidly furnished by the hand\r\nof Nature. It is a bewildering maze of thundering peaks, plunging\r\nvalleys, evergreen forests, glistening glaciers, mirror lakes and\r\nroaring mountain streams. Its leading citizens are white mountain goats,\r\nmountain sheep, moose, mule deer and white-tailed deer, and among those\r\npresent are black and grizzly bears galore.\r\n\r\nCommercially, the 1,400 square miles of Glacier Park, even with its 60\r\nglaciers and 260 lakes, are worth exactly the price of its big trees,\r\nand not a penny more. For mining, agriculture, horticulture and\r\nstock-raising, it is a cipher. As a transcendant pleasure ground and\r\nrecreation wilderness for ninety millions of people, it is worth ninety\r\nmillions of dollars, and not a penny less. It is a pleasure park of\r\nwhich the greatest of the nations of the earth,--whichever that may\r\nbe,--might well be overbearingly proud; and its accessibility is almost\r\nunbelievable until seen.\r\n\r\nThis park is bounded on the south by the Great Northern Railway, on the\r\neast by the Blackfoot Indian Reservation, on the north by Alberta and\r\nBritish Columbia, and on the west by West Fork of the Flathead River.\r\nHorizontally, it contains 1,400 square miles; but as the goat climbs,\r\nits area is at least double that. Its valleys are filled and its lakes\r\nare encircled by grand forests of Douglas fir, hemlock, spruce, white\r\npine, cedar and larch; and if ever they are destroyed by fire, it will\r\nbe a national calamity, a century long.\r\n\r\n_So long as the American people keep out of the poorhouse, let there be\r\nno lumber-cutting vandalism in that park, destroying the beauty of every\r\nacre of forest that is touched by axe or saw. The greatest beauty of\r\nthose forests is the forest floor, which lumbering operations would\r\nutterly destroy_.\r\n\r\nNever mind if there is \"ripe timber\" there! The American nation is not\r\nsuffering for the dollars that those lovely forest giants would fetch by\r\nboard measure. What if a tree does fall now and then from old age! We\r\ncan stand the expense. If Posterity a hundred years hence finds itself\r\nlumberless, and wishes to use those trees, then let Posterity pay the\r\nprice, and take them. We are not suffering for them; and our duty is to\r\nsave them inviolate, and hand them down as a heritage that we proudly\r\ntransmit unimpaired.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: UNITED STATES NATIONAL GAME PRESERVES\r\nand Five Pacific Bird Refuges]\r\n\r\nThe friends of wild life are particularly interested in Glacier Park as\r\na national game reservoir, and refuge for wild life. On the north, in\r\nAlberta, it is soon to be extended by Waterton Lakes Park.\r\n\r\nWhen I visited Glacier Park, in 1909, with Frederick H. Kennard and\r\nCharles H. Conrad, I procured from three intelligent guides their best\r\nestimates of the amount of big game then in the Park. The guides were\r\nThomas H. Scott, Josiah Rogers and Walter S. Gibb.[L]\r\n\r\n[Footnote L: See _Recreation_ Magazine, May, 1910, p. 213]\r\n\r\nThey compared notes, and finally agreed upon these figures:\r\n\r\nElk                         200\r\nMoose                     2,500\r\nMountain Sheep              700\r\nMountain Goats           10,500\r\nGrizzly Bears    1,000 to 1,500\r\nBlack Bears      2,500 to 3,000\r\n\r\nAs previously stated, one of the surprising features of this new wonder\r\nland is its accessibility. The Great Northern lands you at Belton. A\r\nride of three miles over a good road through a beautiful forest brings\r\nyou to the foot of Lake McDonald, and in one hour more by boat you are\r\nat the hotels at the head of the lake. At that point you are within\r\nthree hours' horse-back ride of Sperry Glacier and the marvelous\r\npanorama that unrolls before you from the top of Lincoln Peak. At the\r\nfoot of that Peak we saw a big, wild white mountain goat: and another\r\none watched us climb up to the Sperry Glacier.\r\n\r\nMT. OLYMPUS NATIONAL MONUMENT.--For at least six years the advocates of\r\nthe preservation of American wild life and forests vainly desired that\r\nthe grand mountain territory around Mount Olympus, in northwestern\r\nWashington, should be established as a national forest and game\r\npreserve. In addition to the preservation of the forests, it was greatly\r\ndesired that the remnant bands of Olympic wapiti (described as _Cervus\r\nroosevelti_) should be perpetuated. It now contains 1,975 specimens of\r\nthat variety. In Congress, two determined efforts were made in behalf of\r\nthe region referred to, but both were defeated by the enemies of forests\r\nand wild life.\r\n\r\nIn an auspicious moment, Dr. T.S. Palmer, Assistant Chief of the\r\nBiological Survey, Department of Agriculture, thought of a law under\r\nwhich it would be both proper and right to bring the desired preserve\r\ninto existence. The law referred to expressly clothes the President of\r\nthe United States with power to preserve any monumental feature of\r\nnature which it clearly is the duty of the state to preserve for all\r\ntime from the hands of the spoilers.\r\n\r\nWith the enthusiastic approval and assistance of Representative William\r\nE. Humphrey, of Seattle, Dr. Palmer set in motion the machinery\r\nnecessary to the carrying of the matter before the President in proper\r\nform, and kept it going, with the result that on March 2, 1909,\r\nPresident Roosevelt affixed his signature to the document that closed\r\nthe circuit.\r\n\r\nThus was created the Mount Olympus National Monument, preserving forever\r\n608,640 acres of magnificent mountains, valleys, glaciers, streams and\r\nforests, and all the wild creatures living therein and thereon. The\r\npeople of the state of Washington have good reason to rejoice in the\r\nfact that their most highly-prized scenic wonderland, and the last\r\nsurvivors of the wapiti in that state, are now preserved for all coming\r\ntime. At the same time, we congratulate Dr. Palmer on the brilliant\r\nsuccess of his initiative.\r\n\r\nTHE SUPERIOR NATIONAL GAME AND FOREST PRESERVE.--The people of Minnesota\r\nlong desired that a certain great tract of wilderness in the extreme\r\nnorthern portion of that state, now well stocked with moose and deer,\r\nshould be established as a game and forest preserve. Unfortunately,\r\nhowever, the national government could go no farther than to withdraw\r\nthe lands (and waters) from entry, and declare it a forest reserve. At\r\nthe right moment, some bright genius proposed that the national\r\ngovernment should by executive order create a \"_forest_ reserve,\" and\r\nthen that the legislature of Minnesota should pass an act providing that\r\nevery national forest of that state should also be regarded as a _state\r\ngame preserve_!\r\n\r\nBoth those things were done,--almost as soon as said! Mr. Carlos Avery,\r\nthe Executive Agent of the Board of Game and Fish Commissioners of\r\nMinnesota is entitled to great credit for the action of his state, and\r\nwe have to thank Mr. Gifford Pinchot and President Roosevelt for the\r\nexecutive action that represented the first half of the effort.\r\n\r\nThe new Superior Preserve is valuable as a game and forest reserve, and\r\nnothing else. It is a wilderness of small lakes, marshes, creeks,\r\nhummocks of land, scrubby timber, and practically nothing of commercial\r\nvalue. But the wilderness contains many moose, and zoologically, it is\r\nfor all practical purposes a moose preserve.\r\n\r\nIn it, in 1908 Mr. Avery saw fifty-one moose in three days, Mr.\r\nFullerton saw 183 in nine days, and Mr. Fullerton estimated the total\r\nnumber of moose in Minnesota as a whole at 10,000 head.\r\n\r\nIn area it contains 1,420,000 acres, and the creation of this great\r\npreserve was accomplished on April 13, 1909.\r\n\r\nTHE WICHITA NATIONAL GAME PRESERVE.--In the Wichita Mountains, of\r\nsouthwestern Oklahoma, there is a National game preserve containing\r\n57,120 acres. On this preserve is a fenced bison range and a herd of\r\nthirty-nine American bison which owe their existence to the initiative\r\nof the New York Zoological Society. On March 25, 1905, the Society\r\nproposed to the National Government the founding of a range and herd, on\r\na basis that was entirely new. To the Society it seemed desirable that\r\nfor the encouragement of Congress in the preservation of species that\r\nare threatened with extermination, the scientific corporations of\r\nAmerica, and private individuals also, should do something more than to\r\noffer advice and exhortations to the government.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the Zoological Society offered to present to the\r\nGovernment, delivered on the ground in Oklahoma, a herd of fifteen\r\npure-blood bison as the nucleus of a new national herd, provided\r\nCongress would furnish a satisfactory fenced range, and maintain the\r\nherd. The offer was at once accepted by Hon. James Wilson, Secretary of\r\nAgriculture, and the Society was invited to propose a site for a range.\r\nThe Society sent a representative to the Wichita National Forest\r\nReserve, who recommended a range, and made a report upon it, which the\r\nSociety adopted.\r\n\r\nBy act of Congress the range was at once established and fenced. Its\r\narea is twelve square miles (9,760 acres). In October, 1908, the\r\nZoological Society took from its herd in the Zoological Park nine female\r\nand six male bison, and delivered them at the bison range. There were\r\nmany predictions that all those bison would die of Texas fever within\r\none year; but the parties most interested persisted in trying\r\nconclusions with the famous tick of Texas.\r\n\r\nMr. Frank Rush was appointed Warden of the new National Bison Range, and\r\nhis management has been so successful that only two of the bison died of\r\nthe fever, the disease has been stamped out, and the herd now contains\r\nthirty-nine head. Within five years it should reach the one-hundred\r\nmark. Elk, deer and antelope have been placed in the range, and all save\r\nthe antelope are doing well. The Wichita Bison Range is an unqualified\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nTHE MONTANA NATIONAL BISON RANGE.--The opening of the Flathead Indian\r\nReservation to settlement, in 1909, afforded a golden opportunity to\r\nlocate in that region another national bison herd. Accordingly, in 1908,\r\nthe American Bison Society formulated a plan by which the establishment\r\nof such a range and herd might be brought about. That plan was\r\nsuccessfully carried into effect, in 1909 and '10.\r\n\r\nThe Bison Society proposed to the national government to donate a herd\r\nof at least twenty-five bison, provided Congress would purchase a range,\r\nfence it and maintain the herd. The offer was immediately accepted, and\r\nwith commendable promptness Congress appropriated $40,000 with which to\r\npurchase the range, and fence it. The Bison Society examined various\r\nsites, and finally recommended what was regarded as an ideal location\r\nsituated near Ravalli, Montana, north of the Jocko River and Northern\r\nPacific Railway, and east of the Flathead River. The nearest stations\r\nare Ravalli and Dixon.\r\n\r\nThe area of the range is about twenty-nine square miles (18,521 acres)\r\nand for the purpose that it is to serve it is beautiful and perfect\r\nbeyond compare. In it the bison herd requires no winter feeding\r\nwhatever.\r\n\r\nIn 1910 the Bison Society raised by subscription a fund of $10,526, and\r\nwith it purchased 37 very perfect pure-blood bison from the famous\r\nConrad herd at Kalispell, 22 of which were females. One gift bison was\r\nadded by Mr. and Mrs. Charles Goodnight, two were presented by the\r\nestate of Charles Conrad, and three were presented from the famous\r\nCorbin herd, at Newport, N.H., by the Blue Mountain Forest Association.\r\n\r\nStarting with that nucleus (of 43 head) in 1910, the herd has already\r\n(1912) increased to 80 head. The herd came through the severe winter of\r\n1911-1912 without having been fed any hay whatever, and the founders of\r\nit confidently expect to live to see it increase to one thousand head.\r\n\r\nTHE GRAND CANYON NATIONAL GAME PRESERVE of northern Arizona, embraces\r\nthe entire Grand Canyon of the Colorado River, for a meandering distance\r\nof 101 miles, and adjacent territory to an extent of 2,333 square miles\r\n(1,492,928 acres). Owing to certain conditions, natural and otherwise,\r\nit is not the finest place in the world for the peaceful increase of\r\nwild game. The Canyon contains a few mountain sheep, and mule deer, but\r\nBuckskin Mountain, on the northwestern side, is reeking with mountain\r\nlions and gray wolves, and both those species should be shot out of the\r\nentire Grand Canyon National Forest. It was on Buckskin and the western\r\nwall of the Canyon itself that \"Buffalo\" Jones, Mr. Charles S. Bird, and\r\ntheir party caught nine live mountain lions, in 1909.\r\n\r\nI regret to say that \"Buffalo\" Jones's catalo experiment on the Kaibab\r\nPlateau seems to have met an untimely and disappointing fate. For three\r\nyears the bison and domestic cattle crossed, and produced a number of\r\ncataloes; but in 1911, practically the whole lot was wiped off the earth\r\nby cattle rustlers! Mr. Jones thinks that it was guerrillas from\r\nsouthern Utah who murdered his enterprise, partly for the reason that no\r\nother persons were within striking distance of the herd.\r\n\r\nMOUNT RAINIER NATIONAL PARK.--This fine forest park is the great summer\r\nouting ground of the people of the state of Washington. Its area is 324\r\nsquare miles, and as its name implies it embraces Mount Rainier. Easily\r\naccessible from Seattle and Tacoma, and fairly well--though not\r\n_adequately_--provided with roads, trails, tent camps, hotels and livery\r\ntransportation, it is really the Yellowstone Park of the Northwest.\r\n\r\nTHE YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK in California is so well known that no\r\ndescription of it is necessary. Its area is 1,124 square miles (719,622\r\nacres). Its great value lies in its scenery, but along with that it is a\r\nsanctuary for such of the wild mammals and birds of California as will\r\nnot wander beyond its borders to the certain death that awaits\r\neverything that may legally be killed in that state.\r\n\r\nCRATER LAKE NATIONAL PARK.--Like all the National Parks of America\r\ngenerally, this one also is a game sanctuary. It is situated on the\r\nsummit of the Cascade Mountains of Oregon. The wonderful Crater Lake\r\nitself is 62 miles from Klamath Falls, 83 miles from Ashland, and it is\r\n6 miles long, 4 miles wide and 200 feet deep. This National Park was\r\ncreated by Act of Congress in 1902. Its area is 249 square miles\r\n(159,360 acres), and it contains Columbian black-tailed deer, black\r\nbear, the silver-gray squirrel, and many birds, chiefly members of the\r\ngrouse family. Owing to its lofty elevation, there are few ducks.\r\n\r\nTHE SEQUOIA AND GENERAL GRANT NATIONAL PARKS were created for the\r\nspecial purpose of preserving the famous groves of \"big trees,\"\r\n_(Sequoia gigantea_). The former is in Tulare County, the latter in\r\nTulare and Fresno counties, California, on the western slope of the\r\nSierra Nevadas. The area of Sequoia Park is 169,605 acres, and that of\r\nGeneral Grant Park is 2,560 acres. They are under the control of the\r\nInterior Department. These Parks are important bird refuges, and Mr.\r\nWalter Fry, Forest Ranger, reports in them the presence of 261 species\r\nof birds, none of which may be hunted or shot. Into Sequoia Park 20\r\ndwarf elk and 84 wild turkeys have been introduced, the former from the\r\nherd of Miller and Lux.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER NATIONAL PARKS\r\n\r\nSULLY HILLS NATIONAL PARK, at Devil's Lake (Fort Totten), North Dakota.\r\nArea 960 acres.\r\n\r\nPLATT NATIONAL PARK, Sulphur Springs, Oklahoma; on account of many\r\nmineral springs. Area 848 acres.\r\n\r\nMESA VERDE NATIONAL PARK, Southwestern Colorado; on account of cliff\r\ndwellings, and wonderful cliff and canyon scenery. Area, 66 square\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nNATIONAL MONUMENTS\r\n\r\nUnder a special act of Congress, the President of the United States has\r\nthe power forever to set aside from private ownership and occupation any\r\nimportant natural scenery, or curiosity, or wonderland, the preservation\r\nof which may fairly be regarded as of National importance, and a duty to\r\nthe whole people of the United States. This is accomplished by\r\npresidential proclamation creating a \"national monument.\"\r\n\r\nUnder the terms of this act, 28 national monuments have been created, up\r\nto 1912, of which 17 are under the jurisdiction of the Department of the\r\nInterior, and 11 are managed by the Department of Agriculture. The full\r\nlist is as follows:\r\n\r\nALASKA:                COLORADO:                SOUTH DAKOTA:\r\n  Sitka                  Wheeler                  Jewel Cave\r\n                         Colorado\r\n\r\nARIZONA:\r\n  Montezuma Castle     MONTANA:                 UTAH:\r\n  Petrified Forest       Lewis & Clark Cavern     Natural Bridges\r\n  Tonto                  Big Hole Battlefield     Mukuntuweap\r\n  Grand Canyon                                    Rainbow Bridge\r\n  Tumacacori\r\n  Navajo               NEW MEXICO:\r\n                         El Morro               WASHINGTON:\r\nCALIFORNIA:              Chaco Canyon           Mount Olympus\r\n  Lassen Peak            Gila Cliff Dwellings\r\n  Cinder Cove            Gran Quivira\r\n  Muir Woods                                    WYOMING:\r\n  Pinnacles            OREGON:                    Devil's Tower\r\n  Devil's Postpile       Oregon Caves             Shoshone Cavern\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nTHE NATIONAL BIRD REFUGES.--Says Dr. T.S. Palmer[M]: \"National bird\r\nreservations have been established during the last ten years by\r\nExecutive order for the purpose of affording protection to important\r\nbreeding colonies of water birds, or to furnish refuges for migratory\r\nspecies on their northern or southern flights, or during winter. With\r\nfew exceptions these reservations are either small rocky islets or\r\ntracts of marsh land of no agricultural value.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote M: National Reservations for the Protection of Wild Life, by\r\nT.S. Palmer, U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, Circular No. 87, Oct. 5, 1912.]\r\n\r\nThese reservations are of immense value to bird life, and their creation\r\nrepresents the highest possible wisdom in utilizing otherwise valueless\r\nportions of the national domain. Dr. Palmer's alphabetical list of them\r\nis as follows, numbered in the order of their creation:\r\n\r\nBelle Fourche, S.

As a business\r\nproposition it is to-day no more a debatable question, or open to\r\nargument, than is the water supply or sewer system of a city. The only\r\nperfect way to conserve a water supply for a great human population is\r\nby acquiring title to water sheds, and either protecting the forests\r\nupon them, or planting forests in case none exist.\r\n\r\nIn one important matter the state of Pennsylvania has been wide awake,\r\nand in advance of the times. I will cite her system of forest reserves\r\nand game preserves as a model plan for other states to follow; and I\r\nsincerely hope that by the time the members of the present State Game\r\nCommission have passed from earth the people of Pennsylvania will have\r\nlearned the value of the work they are now doing, and at least give them\r\nthe appreciation that is deserved by public-spirited citizens who do\r\nlarge things for the People without hope of material reward. At this\r\nmoment, Commissioner John M. Phillips and Dr. Joseph Kalbfus are putting\r\ntheir heart's blood into the business of preserving and increasing the\r\ngame and other wild life of Pennsylvania; and the utter lack of\r\nappreciation that is now being shown _in some quarters_ is really\r\ndistressing. I refer particularly to the utterly misguided and mistaken\r\nbody of hunters and anglers having headquarters at Harrisburg, whose\r\nmembers are grossly mislead into a wrong position by a man who seeks to\r\nsecure a salaried state position through the hostile organization that\r\nhe has built up, apparently for his own use. In the belief that those\r\nmembers generally are mislead and not mean-spirited, and that the\r\norganization contains a majority of conscientious sportsmen, I predict\r\nthat ere long the evil genius of Pennsylvania game protection will be\r\nordered to the rear, while the organization as a whole takes its place\r\non the side of the Game Commission, where it belongs.\r\n\r\nThe game sanctuary scheme that Pennsylvania has developed is so new that\r\nas yet only a very small fraction of the people of that state either\r\nunderstand it, or appreciate its far-reaching importance.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, Pennsylvania has acquired up to date about one million\r\nacres of forest lands, scattered through 26 of the 67 counties of the\r\nstate. These great holdings are to be gradually increased. These wild\r\nlands, including many sterile mountain \"farms\" of no real value for\r\nagricultural purposes, have been acquired, first of all, for the purpose\r\nof conserving the water supply of the state; and they are called the\r\nState Forest Reserves.\r\n\r\nNext in order, the State Game Commission has created, in favorable\r\nlocalities in the forest reserves, five great game preserves. The plan\r\nis decidedly novel and original, but is very simple withal. In the\r\ncenter of a great tract of forest reserve, a specially desirable tract\r\nhas been chosen, and its boundaries marked out by the stringing of a\r\nsingle heavy fence wire, surrounding the entire selection. The area\r\nwithin that boundary wire is an absolute sanctuary for all wild\r\ncreatures save those that prey upon game, and in it no man may hunt\r\nanything, nor fire a gun. The boundary wire is by no means a fence, for\r\nit keeps nothing out nor in.\r\n\r\nOutside of the wire and the sanctuary, men may hunt in the open season,\r\nbut at the wire every chase must end. If the hunted deer knows enough to\r\nflee to the sanctuary when attacked, so much the better for the deer.\r\nThe tide of wild life ebbs and flows under the wire, and beyond a doubt\r\nthe deer and grouse will quickly find that within it lies absolute\r\nsafety. There the breeding and rearing of young may go on undisturbed.\r\n\r\nIn view of the fact that hunting may go on in the forest reserve areas\r\nsurrounding these sanctuaries, no intelligent sportsman needs to be told\r\nthat in a few years all such regions will be teeming with deer, grouse\r\nand other game. Where there is one deer to-day there will be twenty ten\r\nyears hence,--because the law of Pennsylvania forbids the killing of\r\ndoes; and then there will be twenty times the legitimate hunting that\r\nthere is to-day. For example, the Clinton County Game Preserve of 3,200\r\nacres is surrounded by 128,000 acres of forest reserve, which form\r\nlegitimate hunting grounds for the game bred in the sanctuary reservoir.\r\nIn Clearfield County the game sanctuary is surrounded by 47,000 acres of\r\nForest Reserve.\r\n\r\nThe _game_ preserves created in Pennsylvania up to date are as follows:\r\n\r\nIn Clinton County        3,200 acres\r\nIn Clearfield County     3,200 acres\r\nIn Franklin County       3,200 acres\r\nIn Perry County          3,200 acres\r\nIn Westmoreland County   2,500 acres\r\n\r\nIt is the deliberate intention of the Game Commission to increase these\r\ngame preserves until there is at least one in each county.\r\n\r\nIt is the policy of the Commission to clear out of the game sanctuaries\r\nall the mammals and birds that destroy wild life, such as foxes, mink,\r\nweasels, skunks and destructive hawks and owls. This is accomplished\r\npartly by buying old horses, killing them in the preserves and poisoning\r\nthem thoroughly with strychnine.\r\n\r\nEach preserve now contains a nucleus herd of white-tailed deer, some of\r\nthem imported from northern Michigan. Ruffed grouse are breeding\r\nrapidly, and in the Clearfield County Preserve there are said to be at\r\nleast three thousand. The Game Commission considers it a patriotic duty\r\nto preserve the wild turkey, ruffed grouse and quail, rather than have\r\nthose species replaced at great expense by species imported from the old\r\nworld. In their work for the protection, preservation and increase of\r\nthe game of Pennsylvania--partly for the purpose of providing legitimate\r\nhunting for the mechanic as well as the millionaire,--the State Game\r\nCommissioners are putting a great amount of thought and labor, and\r\nwhenever their efforts are criticized, their motives impugned or their\r\nhonesty questioned by men who are not worthy to unlace their shoes, it\r\nmakes me tired and angry.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW YORK:\r\n\r\nTHE ADIRONDACK STATE PARK.--With wise and commendable forethought, the\r\nstate of New York has preserved in the Adirondack wilderness, familiarly\r\nknown as \"the North Woods,\" a magnificent forest domain forever\r\ndedicated to campers, outdoorsmen and hunters. At present (1912) it\r\ncontains 2,031 square miles (1,300,000 acres) of forest-clad hills,\r\nvalleys and mountains, adorned by countless lakes and streams. By some\r\npersons it has been believed that in the State's forests the cutting and\r\nsale of large trees would be justifiable business, and agreeable to the\r\npublic; but it has been demonstrated that this is not the case. The\r\npeople of the state firmly object to the havoc that is _unavoidably_\r\nwrought by logging operations in beautiful forests. The state does not\r\nyet need any of the money that could be derived from such operations.\r\nThe chief anxiety of the public is that hereafter forest fires shall be\r\nprevented, no matter what fire protection may cost! The burning of coal\r\non any railway operated through the Adirondacks should be made a penal\r\noffense.\r\n\r\n\r\nMONTANA:\r\n\r\nIn 1911 Governor Norris, Senator Cone and the legislature of Montana, at\r\nthe solicitation of W.R. Felton, L.A. Huffman and others, created the\r\nSNOW CREEK GAME PRESERVE, fronting for ten miles on the Missouri River,\r\nin the northern side of Dawson County. It is a magnificent tract of\r\nbad-lands, very deeply eroded and carved, and highly picturesque. The\r\nnew state preserve contains 96 square miles, but there is so little\r\ngrazing ground for antelope and bison it is absolutely imperative that a\r\nnarrow strip of level grass land should be added along the southern\r\nborder. This proposed addition is being fiercely resisted, by an\r\norganized movement of the sheep owners of Montana (the National Wool\r\nGrowers' Association), who naturally want the public domain for the free\r\ngrazing of their tariff-protected sheep-herds. It remains to be seen\r\nwhether the _three_ sheep men south of the preserve,--the only men who\r\nreally are affected,--will be able to thwart a movement that has for its\r\nobject the development of a very good game preserve for the benefit of\r\nthe ninety millions of the general American public. The range is\r\nnecessary to contain representatives of the big game of the plains that\r\nhas been so ruthlessly swept away, and particularly the vanishing\r\nprong-horned antelope, once very numerous in that region.\r\n\r\nIn order to relieve the sheep men of all trouble on account of that\r\npreserve, the area should be enlarged to the right dimensions and made a\r\nnational preserve. A bill for that purpose (Senate 5,286) is now before\r\nthe Senate, in Senator McLean's Committee, and _help is needed_ to\r\novercome the active hostility of the sheep men, _who vow that it never\r\nshall be passed_! All persons who read this are invited to take this\r\nmatter up with their Senators and Representatives, without a moment's\r\ndelay.\r\n\r\nWYOMING:\r\n\r\nTHE TETON STATE PRESERVE.--One of the largest and most important state\r\ngame preserves thus far established by any of our states is that which\r\nwas created by Wyoming, in 1904. It is situated along the south of, and\r\nfully adjoining, the Yellowstone Park, and its area is 900 square miles\r\n(576,000 acres). Its special purpose is to supplement for the elk herds\r\nand other big game the protection from killing that previously had been\r\nfound in the Yellowstone Park alone. The State Preserve is an admirable\r\nhalf-way house for the migrating herds when they leave the National Park\r\nto seek their regular winter ranges in and around the Jackson Valley.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BIRD RESERVATIONS ON THE GULF COAST AND FLORIDA]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1909, Wyoming established the Big Horn Game Preserve, in the mountain\r\nrange of that name. Into it 25 elk were taken from Jackson Hole, and set\r\nfree, in 1910, at the expense of the Sheridan County Sportsmen's Club.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOUISIANA:\r\n\r\nGreat developments for the preservation of wild life have recently been\r\nwitnessed in Louisiana, all due to the initiative and persistent\r\nactivities of two men, Edward A. McIlhenny, of Avery Island, La., and\r\nCharles Willis Ward, of Michigan, lumberman and horticulturist.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LOUISIANA STATE WILD FOWL REFUGE on Vermillion Bay, has an area of\r\n13,000 acres. It was presented to the state by Messrs. Ward and\r\nMcIlhenny, and formally accepted and protected. It contains a great area\r\nof fresh-water ponds and marshy meadows, wherein grows an abundant\r\nsupply of food for wild fowl. It contains several miles of gravel beach,\r\nwhich during the winter season is visited by thousands of wild geese in\r\nquest of their indispensable supply of gravel. The ponds within its\r\nborders furnish feeding-grounds for canvasback ducks, redhead, mallard,\r\nblackhead and various species of wild geese.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER STATE GAME PRESERVES\r\n                                          Acres\r\n\r\nIDAHO.--Payette River Game Preserve      230,000\r\nCALIFORNIA.--Pinnacles Game Preserve       2,080\r\nWYOMING.--Big Horn Mountains Game Preserve.\r\nMONTANA.--Yellowstone Game Preserve.\r\n          Pryor Mountain Game Preserve.\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII\r\n\r\nGAME PRESERVES AND GAME LAWS IN CANADA\r\n\r\n\r\nAs now set forth on the map of North America, Canada is a vast country.\r\nWe must no longer think of Ontario and Quebec as \"Canada West\" and\r\n\"Canada East,\" because the new assistant-nation owns and rules\r\neverything from Labrador to British Columbia, and all the northern\r\nmainland save Alaska.\r\n\r\nAlthough the fauna of Canada is strictly boreal, it is sufficiently\r\ndispersed and diversified to demand wise legislation, and plenty of it.\r\nFor a nation with an outfit of provinces so new, Canada already is well\r\nadvanced in the matter of game laws and game preserves, and in some\r\nrespects she has set the pace for her southern neighbors. For example,\r\nin New Brunswick we see the lordly moose successfully hunted for sport,\r\nnot only without being exterminated but actually on a basis that permits\r\nit to increase in number. In Nova Scotia we see a law in force _which\r\nsuccessfully prohibits the waste of moose meat_, a loss that\r\ncharacterizes moose hunting everywhere else throughout the range of that\r\nanimal. All over southern Canada the use of automatic shotguns in\r\nhunting is strictly prohibited.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the laws of the Canadians are weak in not preventing\r\nthe sale of all wild game and the killing of antelope. In the matter of\r\ngame-selling, there are far too many open doors, and a sweeping reform\r\nis very necessary.\r\n\r\nSpeaking generally, and with application from Labrador to British\r\nColumbia, the American process of game extermination according to law is\r\nvigorously and successfully being pursued by the people of Canada. The\r\nopen seasons are too long, and the bag limits are too generous to the\r\ngunners. As it is elsewhere, the bag-limit laws on birds are a farce,\r\nbecause it is impossible to enforce them, save on every tenth man. For\r\nexample, in his admirable \"Final Report of the Ontario Game and\r\nFisheries Commission\" (1912), Commissioner Kelly Evans says:\r\n\r\n\"The prairie chicken, which formerly was comparatively plentiful\r\nthroughout the greater portion of the Rainy River District, has now\r\nbecome practically extinct in that region. Various causes have been\r\nassigned for this, but it would seem, as usual, to have been mainly the\r\nfault of indiscriminate and excessive slaughter.\" (Page 226.)\r\n\r\nLike the United States, the various portions of Canada have their\r\nvarious local troubles in wild-life protection. I think the greatest\r\npractical difficulties, and the most real opposition to adequate\r\nmeasures, is found in the Provinces of Quebec and Ontario. Is it because\r\nthe French-descended population is impatient of real restraint, and\r\nobjects to measures that are drastic, even though they are necessary? In\r\nOntario, Commissioner Evans has been splendidly supported by the\r\nGovernment, and by all the real sportsmen of that province; but the\r\ngunners and guerrillas of destruction have successfully postponed\r\nseveral of the reforms that he has advocated, and which should have been\r\ncarried into effect.\r\n\r\nSo far as _public_ moral support for game protection is concerned I\r\nthink that the prairie and mountain provinces have the best of it. In\r\nManitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, Athabasca and British Columbia, the\r\nspirit of the people is mainly correct, and the chief thing that seems\r\nto be lacking is a Kelly Evans in each of those provinces to urge public\r\nsentiment into strong action. For example, why should Alberta still\r\npermit the hunting and killing of prong-horned antelope, when it is so\r\nwell known that that species is vanishing like a mist before the morning\r\nsun? I think it is because no one seems to have risen up as G.O. Shields\r\ndid in the United States, to make a big fuss about it, and demand a\r\nreform. At any rate, all the provinces of Canada that still possess\r\nantelope should _immediately pass laws giving that species absolute\r\nclose seasons for ten years_. Why neglect it longer, when such neglect\r\nis now so very wrong? Whether this is done or not, I sincerely hope that\r\nhereafter no true American sportsman, will be guilty of killing one of\r\nthe vanishing antelope of Canada, even though \"the law doth give it.\"\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nTHE GAME PRESERVES OF CANADA\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the creation of National parks and game preserves, some of the\r\nprovinces of the Canadian nation have displayed a degree of foresight\r\nand enterprise that merits sincere admiration. While in different\r\nprovinces the exact status of these establishments may vary somewhat,\r\nthe main purpose of each is the same,--the preservation of the forests\r\nand the wild life. In all of them a regulated amount of fishing is\r\npermitted, and in some the taking of fur-bearing animals is permitted;\r\nbut I believe in all the birds and furless mammals are strictly\r\nprotected. In some parks the carrying of firearms still is permitted,\r\nbut that privilege is quite out of harmony with the spirit and purposes\r\nof a game preserve, and should be abolished. If it is necessary to carry\r\nfirearms through a preserve, as often happens in the Yellowstone Park,\r\nit can be done under seals that are affixed by duly appointed officers\r\nand thus will temptation be kept out of the way of sinners.\r\n\r\nUp to this date I never have seen a publication which set forth in one\r\nplace even so much as an annotated list of the game preserves of the\r\nvarious provinces of Canada, and at present exact information regarding\r\nthem is rather difficult to obtain. It seems that an adequate\r\ngovernmental publication on this subject is now due, and overdue.\r\n\r\nONTARIO.--\"At the present time,\" says Commissioner Evans in his \"Final\r\nReport,\" \"the Algonquin National Park is the only actual game preserve\r\nin the Province, being in fact a game reserve and not a forest reserve;\r\nbut in the past at least a measure of protection would seem to have been\r\nafforded the game in most of the [forest] reserves, owing to the fact\r\nthat the carrying of firearms therein has been discouraged, and it would\r\nappear to require but the passing of an Order-in-Council to render the\r\ncarrying of firearms in all reserves illegal. It is sincerely to be\r\nhoped that not only will such action be taken without delay, but also\r\nthat all the forest reserves will be declared game reserves in the\r\nstrictest sense.\"\r\n\r\nTo this sentiment all friends of wild life will join a fervent wish for\r\nits realization. As conditions are to-day, it is _impossible to have too\r\nmany game reserves_! There is everything to gain and nothing to lose by\r\nmaking every national forest and forest reserve on the whole continent\r\nof North America a game preserve in the strictest sense, and we hope to\r\nlive to see that end accomplished, both in the United States and Canada.\r\n\r\n_The Algonquin National Park_ is situated in the Parry Sound region,\r\njust above the Muskoka Lakes, and it has an area of 1,930 square miles.\r\nIt is well stocked with moose, caribou, white-tailed deer, black bear\r\nand beaver. During the period of protection the beaver have increased so\r\ngreatly that about 1,000 were trapped last year for the market, by\r\nofficers of the government; and about 25 were sold to zoological gardens\r\nand parks, at $25 each.\r\n\r\n_The Quetico Forest Reserve_, area 1,560 square miles, was created as\r\nthe Canadian complement of the Minnesota National Forest and Game\r\nPreserve. The two join on the international boundary, and each helps to\r\nprotect the other. Both are well stocked with moose, and will render\r\nvaluable service in the preservation of a mid-continental contingent of\r\nthat species.\r\n\r\nALBERTA.--In the making of game preserves the province of Alberta has\r\nbeen splendidly progressive and liberal. The total result is fairly\r\nbeyond the reach of ordinary words of praise. It sets a pace that should\r\nresult in wide-spread benefits to the wild life of North America. In it\r\nthere is nothing faint-hearted. It should make some of our States think\r\nseriously regarding their own shortcomings in this particular field of\r\nendeavor.\r\n\r\n\r\nALBERTA'S NATIONAL PARKS\r\n\r\n                                   Acres           Sq. miles\r\nRocky Mountains Park             2,764,800           4,320\r\nYoho Park                        1,799,680           2,812\r\nGlacier Park                     1,474,560           2,304\r\nBuffalo Park                       384,000             600\r\nElk Island Park                     40,000              62\r\nJasper Park                      3,488,000           5,450\r\nWaterton Lakes Park                 34,560              54\r\n                                 ---------          ------\r\n                                 9,985,600          15,602\r\n\r\n_The Rocky Mountains Park_ is near Banff. The _Yoho_ and _Glacier Parks_\r\nare near Field. The _Buffalo Park_ is near Wainwright, on the plains,\r\nand it was created and fenced especially as a home for the herd of\r\nAmerican bison that was purchased in Montana in 1909. It now contains\r\n1,052 head of bison, 20 moose, 35 deer, 7 elk, and 6 antelope.\r\n\r\n_The Elk Island Park_ is near Fort Saskatchewan and Lamont, and at this\r\ndate (1912) it contains 53 bison, 28 elk, 30 deer and 5 moose. The bison\r\nsubsist entirely by grazing, and upon hay cut within the Park.\r\n\r\n_Jasper Park_, established in 1908, is on the Athabasca River and the\r\nGrand Trunk Pacific Railway, near Strathcona. Sixty miles of the railway\r\nline lie within the Park. Scenically, Jasper Park is a rival of Rocky\r\nMountains Park, and undoubtedly possesses great attractions for\r\ntravellers who appreciate the beauties and grandeur of Nature as\r\nexpressed in mountains, valleys, lakes and streams.\r\n\r\n_Waterton Lakes Park_ is situated in the extreme southwestern corner of\r\nAlberta, in the Rocky Mountains surrounding the Waterton Lakes. At\r\npresent it is nine miles long from north to south and six miles wide,\r\nwith its southern end resting on the international boundary, and\r\nadjoining our Glacier Park. It is the home of a few bands of mountain\r\nsheep that carry very large horns. Through the initiative of Frederick\r\nK. Vreeland, the Camp-Fire Club of America two years ago represented to\r\nthe Government of Alberta the great desirability of enlarging this\r\npreserve, toward the north and west, the better to protect the mountain\r\nsheep and other big game of that region. The suggestion was received in\r\na friendly spirit, and there is good reason to hope that at an early\r\ndate the enlargement will be made.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRITISH COLUMBIA.--This province has made an excellent beginning in the\r\ncreation of game preserves. The first agitation on that subject was\r\nbegun in 1906, by two sportsmen whose names in connection with it have\r\nlong since been forgotten. On November 15, 1908, the Legislative Council\r\nof British Columbia issued a proclamation that created a very fine game\r\npreserve in the East Kootenai District, between the Elk and Bull Rivers\r\nand northwestward thereof to the White River country. By an unfortunate\r\noversight, the new preserve never has been officially named, but we may\r\ndesignate it here as\r\n\r\n_The Elk River Game Preserve_.--This preserve has a total area of about\r\n450 square miles, and includes a fine tract of mountains, valleys, lakes\r\nand streams. It contained in 1908 about 1,000 mountain goats, 200 sheep,\r\na few elk and deer, and about 50 grizzly bears. All these have notably\r\nincreased during the period of absolute protection that they have\r\nenjoyed. It is probable that this preserve contains more white mountain\r\ngoats than any other preserve that thus far has been made. It was in\r\nthis region that Mr. John M. Phillips and Prof. Henry Fairfield Osborne\r\nmade the first mountain goat photographs ever made at close range. It is\r\nto be hoped that the protection of this preserve, both as to its wild\r\nlife and its timber, will be made perpetual.\r\n\r\n_Frazer River Preserve_.--Next after the above there was created in\r\nBritish Columbia a game preserve covering a large portion of the\r\nmountain territory that rises between the North and South Forks of the\r\nFraser River. It is about 75 miles long by 30 miles wide and contains\r\nabout 2,250 square miles. Concerning its character and wild-life\r\npopulation we have no details.\r\n\r\n_Yalakom Game Preserve_.--On the north side of Bridge River (a western\r\ntributary of the Fraser), about twenty miles above Lilloet. there has\r\nbeen established a game preserve having an area of about 215 square\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nMANITOBA.--In the making of game preserves, Manitoba has made an\r\nexcellent beginning. It is good to see from Duck Mountain in the north\r\nto Turtle Mountain in the south a chain of four liberal preserves, each\r\none protected in unmistakable terms as follows: \"Carrying firearms,\r\nhunting or trapping strictly prohibited within this area.\"\r\n\r\nThe lake regions of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta form what is\r\nprobably the most important wild-fowl breeding-ground in North America.\r\nTo a great extent it rests with those provinces to say whether the\r\ncentral United States shall have any ducks and geese, or not! _It is\r\nhigh time that an international treaty should be made between the United\r\nStates, Canada and Mexico for the federal protection of all migratory\r\nbirds_.\r\n\r\nThese preserves are of course intended to conserve wild-fowl,\r\nshore-birds, grouse and all other birds, as well as big game. Thanks to\r\nthe cooperation of Mr. J.M. Macoun, of the Canadian Geological Survey, I\r\nam able to offer the following:\r\n\r\nLIST OF MANITOBA'S GAME PRESERVES\r\n\r\nDUCK MOUNTAIN PRESERVE   324 sq. miles, 207,360 acres.\r\nRIDING MOUNTAIN PRESERVE 360 \"     \"    230,000   \"\r\nSPRUCE WOODS PRESERVE     64 \"     \"     40,960   \"\r\nTURTLE MOUNTAIN PRESERVE 100 \"     \"     64,000   \"\r\n\r\n                         848 \"     \"    542,320   \"\r\n\r\nManitoba is to be congratulated on this record.\r\n\r\nQUEBEC.--This province has created two huge game preserves, well worthy\r\nof the fauna that they are intended to conserve when all hunting in them\r\nis prohibited!\r\n\r\n_The Laurentides National Park_ is second in area of all the national\r\nparks of Canada, being surpassed only by the Rocky Mountains Park of\r\nBritish Columbia. Its area is 3565 square miles, or 2,281,600 acres. It\r\noccupies the entire central portion of the great area surrounded by Lake\r\nSt. John, the Saguenay River, the wide portion of the St. Lawrence, and\r\nthe St. Maurice River on the west. Its southern boundary is in several\r\nplaces only 16 miles from the St. Lawrence, while its most northern\r\nangle is within 13 miles of Lake St. John. Its greatest width from east\r\nto west is 71 miles, and its greatest length from north to south is 79\r\nmiles. It covers a huge watershed in which over a dozen large rivers and\r\nmany small ones have their sources. It is indeed a forest primeval. The\r\nrivers are well stocked with fish, and the big game includes moose,\r\nwoodland caribou, black bear, lynx, beaver, marten, fisher, mink, fox,\r\nand--sad to say--the gray wolf. The caribou live in rather small bands,\r\nfrom 10 up to 100.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, hunting under license is permitted in the Laurentian\r\nNational Park, and therefore it is by no means a _real_ game preserve!\r\nIt is a near-preserve.\r\n\r\n_The Gaspesian Forest, Fish and Game Preserve_, created in 1906, is in\r\n\"the Gaspe country,\" and it has an area of 2500 square miles situated in\r\nthe eastern Quebec counties of Gaspe and Matane.\r\n\r\n_The Connaught National Park_, to be named in honor of H.R.H. the Duke\r\nof Connaught, has been proposed by Mr. J.M. Macoun, of the Canadian\r\nGeological Survey. The general location chosen is the mountains and\r\nforested territory north of Ottawa and the Ottawa River, within easy\r\naccess from the Canadian capitol. On the map the location recommended\r\nlies between the Gatineau River on the east and Wolf Lake on the west.\r\nThe proposal is meeting with much popular favor, and it is extremely\r\nprobable that it will be carried into effect at an early date.\r\n\r\nLABRADOR.--During the past two years Lieut.-Col. William Wood has\r\nstrongly advocated the making of game preserves in Labrador, that will\r\nnot only tend to preserve the scanty fauna of that region from\r\nextinction but will also aid in bringing it back. While Col. Wood's very\r\nenergetic and praiseworthy campaign has not yet been crowned with\r\nsuccess, undoubtedly it will be successful in the near future, because\r\nultimately such causes always win their objects, provided they are\r\nprosecuted with the firm and unflagging persistence which has\r\ncharacterized this particular campaign. We congratulate Col. Wood on the\r\nsuccess that he _will achieve_ in the near future!\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nGAME LAWS OF THE CANADIAN PROVINCES\r\n\r\n\r\nALBERTA.--The worst feature of the Alberta laws is the annual open\r\nseason on antelope, two of which may be killed under each license. This\r\nis _entirely wrong_, and a perpetual close season should at once be\r\nenacted. Duck shooting in August is wrong, and the season should not\r\nopen until September. It is not right that duck-killing should be made\r\nso easy and so fearfully prolonged that extermination is certain. _All\r\nkilling of cranes and shore birds should be absolutely stopped, for five\r\nyears_. No wheat-producing province can afford the expense to the wheat\r\ncrops of the slaughter of shore birds, _thirty species_ of which are\r\ngreat crop-protectors.\r\n\r\nThe bag limit of two sheep is too high, by 50 per cent. It should\r\nimmediately be cut down to one sheep, before sheep hunting in Alberta\r\nbecomes a lost art. _Sheep hunting should not be encouraged_--quite the\r\nreverse! There are already too many sheep-crazy sportsmen. The bag limit\r\non grouse and ptarmigan of 20 per day or 200 in a season is simply\r\nlegalized slaughter, no more and no less, and if it is continued, a\r\ngrouseless province will be the quick result. The birds are not\r\nsufficiently numerous to withstand the guns on that basis. Alberta\r\nshould be wiser than the states below the international boundary that\r\nare annihilating their remnants of birds as fast as they can be found.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRITISH COLUMBIA.--We note with much satisfaction that the Provincial\r\nGame Warden, Mr. A. Bryan Williams, has been allowed $37,000 for the pay\r\nof game wardens, and $28,000 for the destruction of wolves, coyotes,\r\npumas and other game-destroying animals. During the past two years the\r\nfollowing game-destroyers were killed, and bounties were paid upon them:\r\n\r\n                  1909-10 1910-11\r\n\r\nWolves               655   518\r\nCoyotes            1,464 3,653\r\nCougars              382   277\r\nHorned Owls          854 2,285\r\nGolden Eagles         29    73\r\n                   3,374 6,806\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" says Warden Williams in his excellent annual report for 1911, \"in\r\nthese two years a total of 2,896 wolves and cougars and 5,141 coyotes\r\nwere destroyed, as well as a number of others poisoned and not recovered\r\nfor the bounty. Allowing fifty head for each wolf and cougar and ten for\r\neach coyote, by their bounties alone 196,210 head of game and domestic\r\nanimals were saved. Is it any wonder that deer are increasing almost\r\neverywhere?\"\r\n\r\nThe great horned owl has been and still is a great scourge to the upland\r\ngame birds, partly because when game is abundant \"they become\r\nfastidious, and eat only the brains of their prey.\" The destruction of\r\n3,139 of them on the Lower Mainland during the last two years has made\r\nthese owls sing very small, and says the warden, \"Is it any wonder that\r\ngrouse are again increasing?\"\r\n\r\nI have discussed with the Provincial Game Warden the advisability of\r\nputting a limit of one on the grizzly bear, but Mr. Williams advances\r\ngood reasons for the opinion that it would be impracticable to do so at\r\npresent. I am quite sure, however, that the time has already arrived\r\nwhen a limit of one is necessary. During the present year three of my\r\nfriends who went hunting in British Columbia, _each killed 3 grizzly\r\nbears!_ Hereafter I will \"locate\" no more bear hunters in that country\r\nuntil the bag limit is reduced to one grizzly per year. Since 1905 the\r\ntrapping of bears south of the main line of the Canadian Pacific Railway\r\nhas been stopped; and an excellent move too. A Rocky Mountain without a\r\ngrizzly bear is like a tissue-paper rose.\r\n\r\nThe bag limit on the big game of British Columbia is at least twice too\r\nliberal,--five deer, two elk, two moose (one in Kootenay County), three\r\ncaribou and three goats. There is no necessity for such wasteful\r\nliberality. Few sportsmen go to British Columbia for the sake of a large\r\nlot of animals. I know many men who have been there to hunt, and the\r\ngreat majority cared more for the scenery and the wild romance of\r\ncamping out in ground mountains than for blood and trophies.\r\n\r\n\r\nMANITOBA.--What are we to think of a \"bag limit\" of fifty ducks per day\r\nin October and November? A \"limit\" indeed! Evidently, Manitoba is tired\r\nof having ducks, ruffed grouse, pinnated and other grouse pestering her\r\nfarmers and laborers. While assuming to fix bag limits that will be of\r\nsome benefit to those species, the limit is distinctly off, and nothing\r\nshort of a quick and drastic reform will save a remnant that will remain\r\nvisible to the naked eye.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW BRUNSWICK.--This is the banner province in the protection of moose,\r\ncaribou and deer, even while permitting them to be shot for sport. Of\r\ncourse, only males are killed, and I am assured by competent judges that\r\nthus far the killing of the finest and largest male moose has had no bad\r\neffect upon the stature or antlers of the species as a whole.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVA SCOTIA.--If there is anything wrong with the game laws of Nova\r\nScotia, it lies in the wide-open sale of moose meat and all kinds of\r\nfeathered game during the open season. If that province were more\r\nheavily populated, it would mean a great destruction of game. Even with\r\nconditions as they are, the sale permitted is entirely wrong, and\r\nagainst the best interests of 97 per cent of the people.\r\n\r\nAs previously mentioned, the law against the waste of moose meat is both\r\nnovel and admirable. The saving of any considerable portion of the flesh\r\nof a full-grown bull moose, along with its head, is a large order; but\r\nit is right. The degree of accountability to which guides are held for\r\nthe doings of the men whom they pilot into the woods is entirely\r\ncommendable, and worthy of imitation. If a sportsman or gunner does the\r\nwrong thing, the guide loses his license.\r\n\r\n\r\nSASKATCHEWAN.--This is another of the too-liberal provinces having no\r\nreal surplus of big game with which to sustain for any length of time an\r\nexcess of generosity. I am told that in this province there is now a\r\ngreat deal of open country around each wild animal. And yet, it\r\ncheerfully offers two moose, two elk, two caribou and two _antelope_ per\r\nseason to each licensed gunner or sportsman. The limit is too generous\r\nby half. Why throw away an extra $250 worth of game with each license?\r\nThat is precisely what the people of Saskatchewan are doing to-day.\r\n\r\nAnd that antelope-killing! It should be stopped at once, and for ten\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n\r\nYUKON.--This province permits the sale of all the finest and best wild\r\ngame within its borders,--moose, elk, caribou, _bison_, musk-ox, sheep\r\nand goats! The flesh of all these may be sold during the open season,\r\nand for sixty days thereafter. Of the species named above, the barren\r\nground caribou is the only one regarding which we need not worry;\r\nbecause that species still exists in millions. The Osborn caribou\r\n(_Rangifer osborni_), can be exterminated in our own times, because it is\r\nnowhere really numerous, and it inhabits exposed situations.\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\r\n\r\nPRIVATE GAME PRESERVES\r\n\r\n\r\nPrimarily, in the early days of the Man-on-Horseback, the self-elected\r\nand predatory lords of creation evolved the private game preserve as a\r\nscheme for preventing other fellows from shooting, and for keeping the\r\ngame sacred to slaughter by themselves. The idea of conserving the game\r\nwas a fourth-rate consideration, the first being the estoppel of the\r\nother man. The old-world owner of a game preserve delights in the annual\r\nkilling of the surplus game, and we have even heard it whispered that in\r\nthe Dark Ages there were kings who enjoyed the wholesale slaughter of\r\ndeer, wild boar, pheasants and grouse. If we may accept as true the\r\nhistory of sport in Europe, there have been men who have loved slaughter\r\nwith a genuine blood-lust that is quite foreign to the real\r\nnature-loving sportsman.\r\n\r\nIn America, the impulse is different. Here, there is raging a genuine\r\nfever for private game preserves. Some of those already existing are of\r\nfine proportions, and cost fortunes to create. Every true sportsman who\r\nis rich enough to own a private game preserve, sooner or later acquires\r\none. You will find them scattered throughout the temperate zone of North\r\nAmerica from the Bay of Fundy to San Diego. I have had invitations to\r\nvisit preserves in an unbroken chain from the farthest corner of Quebec\r\nto the Pacific Coast, and from Grand Island, Lake Superior to the Gulf\r\nof Mexico. It was not necessarily to hunt, and kill something, but to\r\n_see_ the game, and the beauties of nature.\r\n\r\nThe wealthy American and Canadian joyously buys a tract of wilderness,\r\nfences it, stocks it with game both great and small, and provides game\r\nkeepers for all the year round. At first he has an idea that he will\r\n\"hunt\" therein, and that his guests will hunt also, and actually kill\r\ngame. In a mild way, this fiction sometimes is maintained for years. The\r\nowner may each year shoot two or three head of his surplus big game, and\r\nhis tenderfoot guests who don't know what real hunting is may also kill\r\nsomething, each year. But in most of the American preserves with which I\r\nam well acquainted, the gentlemanly \"sport\" of \"hunting big game\" is\r\nalmost a joke. The trouble is, usually, the owner becomes so attached to\r\nhis big game, and admires it so sincerely, he has not the heart to kill\r\nit himself; and he finds no joy whatever in seeing it shot down by\r\nothers!\r\n\r\nIn this country the slaughter of game for the market is not considered a\r\ngentlemanly pastime, even though there is a surplus of preserve-bred\r\ngame that must be reduced. To the average American, the slaughter of\r\nhalf-tame elk, deer and birds that have been bred in a preserve does not\r\nappeal in the least. He knows that in the protection of a preserve, the\r\nwild creatures lose much of their fear of man, and become easy marks;\r\nand shall a real sportsman go out with a gun and a bushel of cartridges,\r\non a pony, and without warning betray the confidence of the wild in\r\nterms of fire and blood? Others may do it if they like; but as a rule\r\nthat is not what an American calls \"sport.\" One wide-awake and\r\nwell-armed grizzly bear or mountain sheep outwitted on a mountain-side\r\nis worth more as a sporting proposition than a quarter of a mile of deer\r\ncarcasses laid out side by side on a nice park lawn to be photographed\r\nas \"one day's kill.\"\r\n\r\nIn America, the shooting of driven game is something of which we know\r\nlittle save by hearsay. In Europe, it is practiced on everything from\r\nScotch grouse to Italian ibex. The German Crown Prince, in his\r\nfascinating little volume \"From My Hunting Day-Book,\" very neatly fixes\r\nthe value of such shooting, as a real sportsman's proposition, in the\r\nfollowing sentence:\r\n\r\n\"The shooting of driven game is merely a question of marksmanship, and\r\nis after all more in the nature of a shooting exercise than sport.\"\r\n\r\nI have seen some shooting in preserves that was too tame to be called\r\nsport; but on the other hand I can testify that in grouse shooting as it\r\nis done behind the dogs on Mr. Carnegie's moor at Skibo, it is sport in\r\nwhich the hunter earns every grouse that falls to his gun. At the same\r\ntime, also, I believe that the shooting of madly running ibex, as it is\r\ndone by the King of Italy in his three mountain preserves, is\r\nsufficiently difficult to put the best big-game hunter to the test.\r\nThere are times when shooting driven game calls for far more dexterity\r\nwith the rifle than is ordinarily demanded in the still-hunt.\r\n\r\nIn America, as in England and on the Continent of Europe, private game\r\npreserves are so numerous it is impossible to mention more than a very\r\nfew of them, unless one devotes a volume to the subject. Probably there\r\nare more than five hundred, and no list of them is \"up to date\" for more\r\nthan one day, because the number is constantly increasing. I make no\r\npretense even of possessing a list of those in America, and I mention\r\nonly a few of those with which I am best acquainted, by way of\r\nillustration.\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest and the most celebrated deer parks of the United\r\nStates was that of Hon. John Dean Caton, of two hundred acres, located\r\nnear Ottawa, Ill., established about 1859. It was the experiments and\r\nobservations made in that park that yielded Judge Caton's justly famous\r\nbook on \"The Antelope and Deer of America.\"\r\n\r\nThe first game preserve established by an incorporated club was\r\n\"Blooming Grove Park,\" of one thousand acres, in Pennsylvania, where\r\ngreat success has been attained in the breeding and rearing of\r\nwhite-tailed deer.\r\n\r\nIn the eastern United States the most widely-known game preserve is Blue\r\nMountain Forest Park, near Newport, New Hampshire. It was founded in\r\n1885, by the late Austin Corbin, and has been loyally and diligently\r\nmaintained by Austin Corbin, Jr., George S. Edgell and the other members\r\nof the Corbin family. Ownership is vested in the Blue Mountain Forest\r\nAssociation. The area of the preserve is 27,000 acres, and besides\r\nembracing much fine forest on Croydon Mountain, it also contains many\r\nconverted farms whose meadow lands afford good grazing.\r\n\r\nThis preserve contains a large herd of bison (86 head), elk,\r\nwhite-tailed deer, wild boar and much smaller game. The annual surplus\r\nof bison and other large game is regularly sold and distributed\r\nthroughout the world for the stocking of other parks and zoological\r\ngardens. Each year a few surplus deer are quietly killed for the Boston\r\nmarket, but a far greater number are sold alive, at from $25 to $30 each\r\nin carload lots.\r\n\r\nIn the Adirondacks of northern New York, there are a great many private\r\ngame preserves. Dr. T.S. Palmer, in his pamphlet on \"Private Game\r\nPreserves\" (Department of Agriculture) places the number at 60, and\r\ntheir total area at 791,208 acres. Some of them have caused much\r\nirritation among some of the hunting, fishing and trapping residents of\r\nthe Adirondack region. They seem to resent the idea of the exclusive\r\nownership of lands that are good hunting-grounds. This view of property\r\nrights has caused much trouble and some bloodshed, two persons having\r\nbeen killed for presuming to assert exclusive rights in large tracts of\r\nwilderness property.\r\n\r\n\"In the upland preserve under private ownership.\" says Dr. Palmer, \"may\r\nbe found one of the most important factors in the maintenance of the\r\nfuture supply of game and game birds. Nearly all such preserves are\r\nmaintained for the propagation of deer, quail, grouse, or pheasants.\r\nThey vary widely in area, character, and purpose, and embrace some of\r\nthe largest game refuges in the country. Some of the preserves in North\r\nCarolina cover from 15,000 to 30,000 acres; several in South Carolina\r\nexceed 60,000 acres in extent.\" The Megantic Club's northern preserve,\r\non the boundary between Quebec and Maine, embraces nearly 200 square\r\nmiles, or upward of 125,000 acres.\r\n\r\nComparatively few of the larger preserves are enclosed, and on such\r\ngrounds, hunting becomes sport quite as genuine as it is in regions open\r\nto free hunting. In some instances part of the tract is fenced, while\r\nlarge unenclosed areas are protected by being posted. The character of\r\ntheir tenure varies also. Some are owned in fee simple; others,\r\nparticularly the larger ones, are leased, or else comprise merely the\r\nshooting rights on the land. In both size and tenure, the upland\r\npreserves of the United States are comparable with the grouse moors and\r\nlarge deer forests of Scotland.\r\n\r\nOf the game preserves in the South, I know one that is quite ideal. It\r\nis St. Vincent Island, near Apalachicola, Florida, in the northern edge\r\nof the Gulf of Mexico. It was purchased in 1909 by Dr. Ray V. Pierce,\r\nand his guests kill perhaps one hundred ducks each year out of the\r\nthousands that flock to the ten big ponds that occupy the eastern third\r\nof the island. Into those ponds much good duck food has been\r\nintroduced,--_Potamogeton pectinatus_ and _perfoliatus_. The area of\r\nthe island is twenty square miles. Besides being a great winter resort\r\nfor ducks, its sandy, pine-covered ridges and jungles of palms to and\r\nlive oak afford fine haunts and feeding grounds for deer. Those jungles\r\ncontain two species of white-tailed deer (_Odocoileus louisiana_ and\r\n_osceola_), and Dr. Pierce has introduced the Indian sambar deer and\r\nJapanese sika deer _(Cervus sika_), both of which are doing well. We are\r\nwatching the progress of those big sambar deer with very keen interest,\r\nand it is to be recorded that already that species has crossed with the\r\nLouisiana white-tailed deer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP OF MARSH ISLAND AND ADJACENT WILD-FOWL PRESERVES]\r\n\r\nDuring the autumn of 1912, public attention in the United States was for\r\na time focused on the purchase of Marsh Island, Louisiana, by Mrs.\r\nRussell Sage, and its permanent dedication to the cause of wild-life\r\nprotection. This delightful event has brought into notice the Louisiana\r\nState Game Preserve of 13,000 acres near Marsh Island, and its\r\nhinterland (and water) of 11,000 acres adjoining, which constitutes the\r\nWard-McIlhenny Wild Fowl Preserve. These three great preserves taken\r\ntogether as they lie form a wild-fowl sanctuary of great size, and of\r\ngreat value to the whole Mississippi Valley. Now that all duck-shooting\r\ntherein has been stopped, it is safe to predict that they shortly will\r\nbe inhabited by a wild-fowl population that will really stagger the\r\nimagination.\r\n\r\n\r\nDUCK-SHOOTING \"PRESERVES.\"--A ducking \"preserve\" is a large tract of\r\nland and water owned by a few individuals, or a club, for the purpose of\r\npreserving exclusively for themselves and their friends the best\r\npossible opportunities for killing large numbers of ducks and geese\r\nwithout interference. In no sense whatever are they intended to preserve\r\nor increase the supply of wild fowl. The real object of their existence\r\nis duck and goose slaughter. For example, the worst goose-slaughter\r\nstory on record comes to us from the grounds of the Glenn County Club in\r\nCalifornia, whereon, as stated elsewhere, two men armed with automatic\r\nshotguns killed 218 geese in one hour, and bagged a total of 452 in one\r\nday.\r\n\r\nI shall not attempt to give any list of the so-called ducking\r\n\"preserves.\" The word \"preserve,\" when applied to them, is a misnomer.\r\nThirteen states have these incorporated slaughtering-grounds for ducks\r\nand geese, the greatest number being in California, Illinois, North\r\nCarolina and Virginia. California has carried the ducking-club idea to\r\nthe limit where it is claimed that it constitutes an abuse. Dr. Palmer\r\nsays that one or two of the club preserves on the western side of the\r\nSan Joaquin Valley contain upward of _40 square miles, or 25,000 acres\r\neach_! With considerable asperity it is now publicly charged (in the\r\ncolumns of _The Examiner_ of San Francisco) that for the unattached\r\nsportsmen there is no longer any duck-shooting to be had in California,\r\nbecause all the good ducking-grounds are owned and exclusively\r\ncontrolled by clubs. In many states the private game preserves are a\r\nsource of great irritation, and many have been attacked in courts of\r\nlaw.[N]\r\n\r\n[Footnote N: \"Private Game Preserves and their Future in the United\r\nStates,\" by T.S. Palmer, United States Department of Agriculture, 1910.]\r\n\r\nBut I am not sorrowing over the woes of the unattached duck-hunter, or\r\nin the least inclined to champion his cause against the ducking-club\r\nmember. As slaughterers and exterminators of wild-fowl, rarely\r\nexercising mercy under ridiculous bag-limits, they have both been too\r\nheedless of the future, and one is just as bad for the game as the\r\nother. If either of them favored the game, I would be on his side; but I\r\nsee no difference between them. They both kill right up to the\r\nbag-limit, as often as they can; and that is what is sweeping away all\r\nour feathered game.\r\n\r\nCuriously enough, the angry unattached duck-hunters of California are\r\nto-day proposing to have revenge on the duck-clubbers by _removing all\r\nrestrictions on the sale of game_! This is on the theory that the\r\nduckless sportsmen of the State of California would like to _buy_ dead\r\nducks and geese for their tables! It is a novel and original theory, but\r\nthe sane people of California never will enact it into law. It would be\r\na step just _twenty years backward_!\r\n\r\nTHE PUBLIC vs. THE PRIVATE GAME PRESERVE.--Both the executive and the\r\njudiciary branches of our state governments will in the future be called\r\nupon with increasing frequency to sit in judgment on this case.\r\nConditions about us are rapidly changing. The precepts of yesterday may\r\nbe out of date and worthless tomorrow. By way of introspection, let us\r\nsee what principles of equity toward Man and Nature we would lay down as\r\nthe basis of our action if we were called to the bench. Named in logical\r\nsequence they would be about as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Any private game \"preserve\" that is maintained chiefly as a\r\nslaughter-ground for wild game, either birds or mammals, may become\r\ndetrimental to the interests of the people at large.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EGRETS AND HERONS IN SANCTUARY ON MARSH ISLAND]\r\n\r\n2. It is not necessarily the duty of any state to provide for the\r\nmaintenance of private death-traps for the wholesale slaughter of\r\n_migratory_ game.\r\n\r\n3. An oppressive monopoly in the slaughter of migratory game is\r\ndetrimental to the interests of the public at large, the same as any\r\nother monopoly.\r\n\r\n4. Every de facto game preserve, maintained for the preservation of wild\r\nlife rather than for its slaughter, is an institution beneficial to the\r\npublic at large, and therefore entitled to legal rights and privileges\r\nabove and beyond all which may rightly be accorded to the so-called\r\n\"preserves\" that are maintained as killing-grounds.\r\n\r\n5. The law may justly discriminate between the actual game preserve and\r\nthe mere killing-ground.\r\n\r\n6. Whenever a killing-ground becomes a public burden, it may be abated,\r\nthe same as any other public infliction.\r\n\r\nIn private game preserves the time has arrived when lawmakers and judges\r\nmust begin to apply the blood-test, and separate the true from the\r\nfalse. And at every step, _the welfare of the wild life involved_ must\r\nbe given full consideration. No men, nor body of men, should be\r\npermitted to practice methods that spell extermination.\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX\r\n\r\nBRITISH GAME PRESERVES IN AFRICA AND AUSTRALIA\r\n\r\n\r\nThis brief chapter is offered as an object-lesson to the world at large.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of America, the founders of our states and territories\r\ngave little heed, or none at all, to the preservation of wild life. Even\r\nif they thought of that duty, undoubtedly they felt that the game would\r\nalways last, and that they had no time for such sentimental side issues\r\nas the making of game preserves. They were coping with troubles and\r\nperplexities of many kinds, and it is not to be wondered at that up to\r\nforty years ago, real game protection in America went chiefly by\r\ndefault.\r\n\r\nIn South Africa, precisely the same conditions have prevailed until\r\nrecent times. The early colonists were kept so busy shooting lions and\r\nmaking farms that not one game preserve was made. If any men can be\r\nexcused from the work and worry of preserving game, and making\r\npreserves, it is those who spend their lives pioneering and\r\nstate-building in countries like Africa. Men who continually have to\r\ncontend with disease, bad food, rains, insect pests, dangerous wild\r\nbeasts and native cussedness may well claim that they have troubles\r\nenough, without going far into campaigns to preserve wild animals in\r\ncountries where animals are plentiful and cheap. It is for this reason\r\nthat the people of Alaska can not be relied upon to preserve the Alaskan\r\ngame. They are busy with other things that are of more importance to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1900, representatives of the great powers owning territory in\r\nAfrica held a conference in the interests of the wild-animal life of\r\nthat continent. As a result a Convention was signed by which those\r\npowers bound themselves \"to make provision for the prevention of further\r\nundue destruction of wild game.\" The principles laid down for universal\r\nobservance were as follows:\r\n\r\n  1. Sparing of females and immature animals.\r\n  2. The establishment of close seasons and game sanctuaries.\r\n  3. Absolute protection of rare species.\r\n  4. Restrictions on export for trading purposes of skins, horns,\r\n  tusks, etc.\r\n  5. Prohibition of the use of pits, snares and game traps.\r\n\r\nThe brave and hardy men who are making for the British people a grand\r\nempire in Africa probably are greater men than far-distant people\r\nrealize. To them, the white man's burden of game preservation is\r\naccepted as all in the day's work. A mere handful of British civil\r\nofficers, strongly aided by the Society for the Preservation of the\r\nFauna of the British Empire, have carved out and set aside a great chain\r\nof game preserves reaching all the way from Swaziland and the Transvaal\r\nto Khartoum. Taken either collectively or separately, it represents\r\ngrand work, characteristic of the greatest colonizers on earth. Those\r\npreserves are worthy stones in the foundation of what one day will be a\r\ngreat British empire in Africa. The names of the men who proposed them\r\nand wrought them out should, in some way, be imperishably connected with\r\nthem as their founders, as the least reward that Posterity can bestow.\r\n\r\nIn Major J. Stevenson-Hamilton's fine work, \"Animal Life in Africa,\"[O]\r\nthe author has been at much pains to publish an excellent series of maps\r\nshowing the locations of the various British game preserves in Africa,\r\nand the map published herewith has been based chiefly on that work. It\r\nis indeed fortunate for the wild life of Africa that it has today so\r\npowerful a champion and exponent as this author, the warden of the\r\nTransvaal Game Preserves.\r\n\r\n[Footnote O: Published by Heinemann, London, 1912.]\r\n\r\nEvents move so rapidly that up to this date no one, so far as I am\r\naware, has paused long enough to make and publish an annotated list of\r\nthe African game preserves. Herein I have attempted to _begin_ that task\r\nmyself, and I regret that at this distance it is impossible for me to\r\nset down under the several titles the names of the men who made these\r\npreserves possible, and actually founded them.\r\n\r\nTo thoughtful Americans I particularly commend this list as a showing of\r\nthe work of men who have not waited until the game had been _practically\r\nexterminated_ before creating sanctuaries in which to preserve it. In\r\nview of these results, how trivial and small of soul seems the mercenary\r\nefforts of the organized wool-growers of Montana to thwart our plan to\r\nsecure a paltry fifteen square miles of grass lands for the rugged and\r\narid Snow Creek Antelope Preserve that is intended to help save a\r\nvaluable species from quick extermination.\r\n\r\nAt this point I must quote the views of a high authority on the status\r\nof wild life and game preserves in Africa. The following is from Major\r\nStevenson-Hamilton's book.\r\n\r\n\"It is a remarkable phenomenon in human affairs how seldom the\r\nexperience of others seems to turn the scale of action. There are, I\r\ntake it, very few farmers, in the Cape Colony, the Orange Free State, or\r\nthe Transvaal, who would not be glad to see an adequate supply of game\r\nupon their land. Indeed, the writer is constantly dealing with\r\napplications as to the possibility of reintroducing various species from\r\nthe game reserves to private farms, and only the question of expense and\r\nthe difficulty of transport have, up to the present, prevented this\r\nbeing done on a considerable scale. When, therefore, the relatively\r\nsmall populations of such protectorates as are still well stocked with\r\ngame are heard airily discussing the advisability of getting rid of it\r\nas quickly as possible, one realizes how often vain are the teachings of\r\nhistory, and how well-nigh hopeless it is to quote the result of similar\r\naction elsewhere. It remains only to trust that things may be seen in\r\ntruer perspective ere it is too late, and that those in whose temporary\r\ncharge it is may not cast recklessly away one of nature's most splendid\r\nassets, one, moreover, which once lightly discarded, can never by any\r\npossibility, be regained.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MOST IMPORTANT GAME PRESERVES OF AFRICA\r\nThe Numbers Refer to Corresponding Numbers in the Text]\r\n\r\n\"It is idle to say that the advance of civilization must necessarily\r\nmean the total disappearance of all wild animals. This is one of those\r\nglib fallacies which flows only too readily from unthinking lips.\r\nCivilization in its full sense--not the advent of a few scattered\r\npioneers--of course, implies their restriction, especially as regards\r\npurely grass-feeding species, within certain definite bounds, both as\r\nregards numbers and sanctuaries. But this is a very different thing from\r\nwholesale destruction, that a few more or less deserving individuals may\r\nreceive some small pecuniary benefit, or gratify their taste for\r\nslaughter to the detriment of everyone else who may come after. _The\r\nfauna of an empire is the property of that empire as a whole, and not of\r\nthe small portion of it where the animals may happen to exist; and while\r\nfull justice and encouragement must be given to the farmer and pioneer,\r\nneither should be permitted to entirely demolish for his own advantage\r\nresources which, strictly speaking, are not his own_.\"--(\"Animal Life in\r\nAfrica.\" p. 24.)\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nAFRICAN GAME PRESERVES\r\n\r\n\r\nBRITISH EAST AFRICA:\r\n\r\n1.[P] _The Athi Plains Preserve_.--This is situated between the Uganda\r\nRailway and the boundary of German East Africa. Its northern boundary is\r\none mile north of the railway track. It is about 215 miles long east and\r\nwest by 105 miles from north to south, and its area is about 13,000\r\nsquare miles. It is truly a great preserve, and worthy of the plains\r\nfauna that it is specially intended to perpetuate.\r\n\r\n[Footnote P: These numbers refer to corresponding numbers on the map of\r\nAfrica.]\r\n\r\n2. _The Jubaland Preserve_.--This preserve lies northwest of Mount\r\nKenia. Its southwestern corner is near Lake Baringo, the Laikipia\r\nEscarpment is its western boundary up to Mt. Nyiro, and from that point\r\nits northern boundary runs 225 miles to Marsabit Lake. From that point\r\nthe boundary runs south-by-west to the Guaso Nyiro River, which forms\r\nthe eastern half of the southern boundary.

A great nameless sanctuary for wild life exists on the eastern bank\r\nof the Nile, comprising the whole territory between the main stream, the\r\nBlue Nile and Abyssinia. Its length (north and south) is 215 miles, and\r\nits width is about 125 miles; which means a total area of about 26,875\r\nsquare miles.

I am informed that this offers a golden opportunity to\r\nsecure a fine wild-life sanctuary at ridiculously small cost to the\r\npublic. The whole world is interested in the preservation of the\r\nremarkable fauna of Tasmania. The extermination of the thylacine would\r\nbe a zoological calamity; but it is impending.\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL\r\n\r\nBREEDING GAME AND FUR IN CAPTIVITY\r\n\r\n\r\nGAME BREEDING.--The breeding of game in captivity for sale in the\r\nmarkets of the world is just as legitimate as the breeding of domestic\r\nspecies. This applies equally to mammals, birds, reptiles and fishes. It\r\nis the duty of the nation and the state to foster such industries and\r\nfacilitate the marketing of their products without any unnecessary\r\nformalities, delays or losses to producers or to purchasers.\r\n\r\nAlready this principle has been established in several states. Without\r\ngoing into the records, it is safe to say that Colorado was the pioneer\r\nin the so-called \"more-game\" movement, about 1899; but there is one\r\nperson who would like to have the world believe that it started in the\r\nstate of New York, about 1909. The idea is not quite as \"old as the\r\nhills,\" but the application of it in the United States dates back\r\nthrough a considerable vista of years.\r\n\r\nThe laws of Colorado providing for the creation of private game\r\npreserves and the marketing of their product under a tagging system, are\r\nvery elaborate, and they show a sincere desire to foster an industry as\r\nyet but slightly developed in this country. The laws of New York are\r\nmuch more simple and easy to understand than those of Colorado.\r\n\r\nThere is one important principle now fully recognized in the New York\r\nlaws for game breeding that other states will do well to adopt. It is\r\nthe fact that certain kinds of wild game _can not be bred and reared in\r\ncaptivity on a commercial basis_; and this being true, it is clearly\r\nagainst public policy to provide for the sale of any such species. Why\r\nprovide for the sale of preserve-bred grouse and ducks which we know can\r\nnot be bred and reared in confinement in marketable numbers? For\r\nexample, if we may judge by the numerous experiments that _thus far_\r\nhave been made,--as we certainly have a right to do,--no man can\r\nsuccessfully breed and rear in captivity, on a commercial basis, the\r\ncanvasback duck, teal, pintail duck, ruffed grouse or quail. This being\r\nthe case, no amount of clamor from game dealers and their allies ever\r\nshould induce any state legislature to provide for the sale of any of\r\nthose species _until it has been fully demonstrated_ that they _have\r\nbeen_ and _can be_ bred in captivity in large numbers. The moment the\r\nmarkets of a state are thrown open to these impossible species, from\r\nthat moment the state game wardens must make a continuous struggle to\r\nprevent the importation and sale of those birds contrary to law. This\r\nproposition is so simple that every honest man can see it.\r\n\r\nAll that any state legislature may rightfully be asked to do is to\r\nprovide for the sale, under tags, of those species which _we know_ can\r\nbe bred in captivity in large numbers.\r\n\r\nWhen the Bayne law was drafted, its authors considered with the utmost\r\ncare the possibilities in the breeding of game in the United States on a\r\ncommercial basis. It was found that as yet only two wild native species\r\nhave been, and can be, reared in captivity on a large scale. These are\r\nthe white-tailed deer and mallard duck. Of foreign species we can breed\r\nsuccessfully for market the fallow deer, red deer of Europe and some of\r\nthe pheasants of the old world. For the rearing, killing and marketing\r\nof all these, the Bayne law provides the simplest processes of state\r\nsupervision that the best game protectors and game breeders of New York\r\ncould devise. The tagging system is expeditious, cheap and effective.\r\nPractically the only real concession that is required of the\r\ngame-breeder concerns the killing, which must be done in a systematic\r\nway, whereby a state game warden can visit the breeder's premises and\r\naffix the tags without any serious sacrifice of time or convenience on\r\neither side. The tags cost the breeder five cents each, and they pay the\r\ncost of the services rendered by the state.\r\n\r\nBy this admirable system, which is very plainly set forth in the New\r\nYork Conservation Commission's book of game laws, all the _wild_ game of\r\nNew York, _and of every other state_, is absolutely protected at all\r\ntimes against illegal killing and illegal importation for the New York\r\nmarket. Now, is it not the duty of Connecticut, Maryland, Virginia, the\r\nCarolinas and every other state to return our compliment by passing\r\nsimilar laws? Massachusetts came up to public expectations at the next\r\nsession of her legislature after the passage of our Bayne law. In 1913,\r\nCalifornia will try to secure a similar act; and we know full well that\r\nher ducks, geese, quail, grouse and band-tailed pigeon need it very\r\nmuch. If the California protectors of wild life succeed in arousing the\r\ngreat quiet mass of people in that state, their Bayne bill will be swept\r\nthrough their legislature on a tidal wave of popular sentiment.\r\n\r\n_Elk_.--For people who own wild woodlands near large cities there are\r\ngood profits to be made in rearing white-tailed deer for the market. I\r\nwould also mention elk, but for the fact that every man who rears a fine\r\nherd of elk quickly becomes so proud of the animals, and so much\r\nattached to them, that he can not bear to have them shot and butchered\r\nfor market! Elk are just as easy to breed and rear as domestic cattle,\r\nexcept that in the fall breeding season, the fighting of rival bulls\r\ndemands careful and intelligent management. Concerning the possibilities\r\nof feeding elk on hay at $25 per ton and declaring an annual profit, I\r\nam not informed. If the elk require to be fed all the year round, the\r\nhigh price of hay and grain might easily render it impossible to produce\r\nmarketable three-year-old animals at a profit.\r\n\r\n_White-tailed Deer_.--Any one who owns from one hundred to one thousand\r\nacres of wild, brushy or forest-covered land can raise white-tailed (or\r\nVirginia) deer at a profit. With smaller areas of land, free range\r\nbecomes impossible, and the prospects of commercial profits diminish\r\nand disappear. In any event, a fenced range is absolutely essential; and\r\nthe best fence is the Page, 88 inches high, all horizontals of No. 9\r\nwire, top and bottom wires of No. 7, and the perpendicular tie-wires of\r\nNo. 12. This fence will hold deer, elk, bison and wild horses. In large\r\nenclosures, the white-tailed deer is hardy and prolific, and when fairly\r\ncooked its flesh is a great delicacy. In Vermont the average weights of\r\nthe deer killed in that state in various years have been as follow:--in\r\n1902, 171 lbs.; in 1903, 190 lbs.; in 1905, 198 lbs.; in 1906, 200 lbs.;\r\nin 1907, 196 lbs.; in 1908, 207 lbs.; and in 1909, 155 lbs. The reason\r\nfor the great drop in 1909 is yet to be ascertained.\r\n\r\nIn 1910, in New York City the wholesale price of whole deer carcasses\r\nwas from 22 to 25 cents per pound. Venison saddles were worth from 30 to\r\n35 cents per pound. On the bill of fare of a first class hotel, a\r\nportion of venison costs from $1.50 to $2.50 according to the diner's\r\nlocation. It is probable that such prices as these will prevail only in\r\nthe largest cities, and therefore they must not be regarded as general.\r\n\r\nLive white-tailed deer can be purchased for breeding purposes at prices\r\nranging from $25 to $35 each. A good eastern source of supply is Blue\r\nMountain Forest, Mr. Austin Corbin, president (Broadway and Cortlandt\r\nSt., New York). In the West, good stock can be procured from the\r\nCleveland-Cliffs Iron Company, through C.V.R. Townsend, Negaunee, Mich.,\r\nwhose preserve occupies the whole of Grand Island, Lake Superior.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Agriculture has published for free distribution a\r\npamphlet entitled \"Raising Deer and Other Large Game Animals\" in the\r\nUnited States, by David E. Lantz, which contains much valuable\r\ninformation, although it leaves much unsaid.\r\n\r\nAll breeders of deer are cautioned that during the fall and early winter\r\nmonths, all adult white-tailed bucks are dangerous to man, and should be\r\ntreated accordingly. A measure of safety can be secured in a large park\r\nby compelling the deer always to keep at a respectful distance, and\r\nmaking no \"pets,\" whatever. Whenever a buck finds his horns and loses\r\nhis fear of man, climb the fence quickly. Bucks in the rutting season\r\nsometimes seem to go crazy, and often they attack men, wantonly and\r\ndangerously. The method of attack is to an unarmed man almost\r\nirresistible. The animal lowers his head, stiffens his neck and with\r\nterrible force drives straight forward for your stomach and bowels.\r\nUsually there are eight sharp spears of bone to impale you. The best\r\ndefense of an unarmed man is to seize the left antler with the left\r\nhand, and with the right hand pull the deer's right front foot from\r\nunder him. Merely holding to the horns makes great sport for the deer.\r\nHe loves that unequal combat. The great desideratum is to put his fore\r\nlegs out of commission, and get him down on his knees.\r\n\r\nDoes are sometimes dangerous, and inflict serious damage by rising on\r\ntheir hind feet and viciously striking with their sharp front hoofs.\r\nThese tendencies in American deer are mentioned here as a duty to\r\npersons who may desire to breed deer for profit.\r\n\r\n_The Red Deer of Europe_.--Anyone who has plenty of natural forest food\r\nfor deer and a good market within fair range, may find the European red\r\ndeer a desirable species. It is of size smaller, and more easily\r\nmanaged, than the wapiti; and is more easily marketed because of its\r\nsmaller size. As a species it is hardy and prolific, and of course its\r\nvenison is as good as that of any other deer. Live specimens for\r\nstocking purposes can be purchased of S.A. Stephan, Agent for Carl\r\nHagenbeck, Cincinnati Zoological Gardens, or of Wenz & Mackensen,\r\nYardley, Pa., at prices ranging from $60 to $100 each, according to size\r\nand age. At present the supply of specimens in this country on hand for\r\nsale is very small.\r\n\r\n_The Fallow Deer_.--This species is the most universal park deer of\r\nEurope. It seems to be invulnerable to neglect and misuse, for it has\r\npersisted through countless generations of breeding in captivity, and\r\nthe abuse of all nations. In size it is a trifle smaller than our\r\nwhite-tailed deer, with spots in summer, and horns that are widely\r\nflattened at the extremities in a very interesting way. It is very hardy\r\nand prolific, but of course it can not stand everything that could be\r\nput upon it. It needs a dry shed in winter, red clover hay and crushed\r\noats for winter food; and no deer should be kept in mud. As a commercial\r\nproposition it is not so meaty as the white-tail, but it is _less\r\ntroublesome to keep_. The adult males are not such vicious or dangerous\r\nfighters as white-tail bucks. Live specimens are worth from $50 to $75.\r\nThe Essex County Park Commissioners (Orange, New Jersey) have had\r\nexcellent success with this species. In 1906 they purchased twenty-five\r\ndoes and four bucks and placed them in an enclosure of 150 acres, on a\r\nwooded mountain-side. In 1912 they had 150 deer, and were obliged to\r\ntake measures for a disposal of the surplus. Messrs. Wenz & Mackensen,\r\nkeep an almost continuous supply of fallow deer on hand for sale.\r\n\r\n_The Indian Sambar Deer_.--I have long advocated the introduction in the\r\nsouthern states, _wherever deer can be protected_, of this great,\r\nhulking, animated venison-factory. While I have not delved deeply into\r\nthe subject of weight and growth, I feel sure from casual observations\r\nof the growth of about twenty-five animals that this species produces\r\nmore venison during the first two years of its life than any other deer\r\nwith which I am acquainted. I regard it as the greatest venison-producer\r\nof the whole Deer Family; and I know that is a large order. The size of\r\na yearling is almost absurd, it is so great for an animal of tender\r\nyears. When adult, the species is for its height very large and heavy.\r\nAs a food-producing animal, located in the southern hill forests and\r\ntaking care of itself, \"there's millions in it!\" But _it must be kept\r\nunder fence_; for in no southern (or northern) state would any such mass\r\nof juicy wild meat long be permitted to roam at large unkilled. Through\r\nthis species I believe that a million acres of southern timber lands,\r\nnow useless except for timber growth, could be made very productive in\r\nchoice venison. The price would be,--a good fence, and protection from\r\npoachers.\r\n\r\nThe Indian sambar deer looks like a short-legged big-bodied understudy\r\nof our American elk. It breeds well in captivity, and it is of quiet\r\nand tractable disposition. It can not live in a country where the\r\ntemperature goes down to 25 degrees F. and _remains there for long\r\nperiods_. It would, I am firmly convinced, do well all along the Gulf\r\ncoast, and if acclimatized along the Gulf, with the lapse of time and\r\ngenerations it would become more and more hardy, grow more hair, and\r\npush its way northward, until it reached the latitude of Tennessee. But\r\nthen, in a wild state it could not be protected from poachers. As stated\r\nelsewhere, Dr. Ray V. Pierce has successfully acclimatized and bred this\r\nspecies in his St. Vincent Island game preserve, near Apalachicola,\r\nFlorida. More than that, the species has crossed with the white-tailed\r\ndeer of the Island.\r\n\r\nLiving specimen of the Indian Sambar deer are worth from $125 to $250,\r\naccording to size and other conditions. Just at present it seems\r\ndifficult for Americans to procure a sufficient number of _males!_ We\r\nhave had very bad luck with several males that we attempted to import\r\nfor breeding purposes.\r\n\r\n_The Mallard Duck_.--A great many persons have made persistent attempts\r\nto breed the canvasback, redhead, mallard, black duck, pintail, teal and\r\nother species, on a commercial basis. So far as I am aware the mallard\r\nis the only wild duck that has been bred in sufficient numbers to\r\nslaughter for the markets. The wood duck and mandarin can be bred in\r\nfair numbers, but only sufficient to supply the demand for _living_\r\nbirds, for park purposes. One would naturally suppose that a species as\r\nclosely allied to the mallard as the black duck _is_ known to be, would\r\nbreed like the mallard; but the black duck is so timid and nervous about\r\nnesting as to be almost worthless in captivity. All the species named\r\nabove, except the mallard, must at present, and in general, be regarded\r\nas failures in breeding for the market.\r\n\r\nOf all American ducks the common mallard is the most persistent and\r\nsuccessful breeder. It quickly becomes accustomed to captivity, it\r\nenjoys park life, and when given even half a chance it will breed and\r\nrear its young.\r\n\r\nUnquestionably, the mallard duck can be reared in captivity in numbers\r\nlimited only by the extent of breeder's facilities. The amount of net\r\nprofit that can be realized depends wholly upon the business acumen and\r\njudgment displayed in the management of the flock. The total amount of\r\nknowledge necessary to success is not so very great, but at the same\r\ntime, the exercise of a fair amount of intelligence, and also careful\r\ndiligence, is absolutely necessary. Naturally the care and food of the\r\nflock must not cost extravagantly, or the profits will inevitably\r\ndisappear.\r\n\r\nAs a contribution to the cause of game-breeding for the market, and the\r\ncreation of a new industry of value, Mr. L.S. Crandall and the author\r\nwrote for the New York State Conservation Commission a pamphlet on\r\n\"Breeding Mallard Ducks for Market.\" Copies of it can be procured of our\r\nState Conservation Commission at Albany, by enclosing ten cents in\r\nstamps.\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nBREEDING FUR-BEARING ANIMALS\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen hundreds of persons wrote to me asking for literature on the\r\nbreeding of fur-bearing animals for profit, for ten years I was\r\ncompelled to tell them that there was no such literature. During the\r\npast three years a few offerings have been made, and I lose not a moment\r\nin listing them here.\r\n\r\n\"_Life Histories of Northern Animals_\", by Ernest T. Seton (Charles\r\nScribner's Sons, 2 volumes, $18), contains carefully written and\r\nvaluable chapters on fox farming, skunk farming, marten farming, and\r\nmink farming, and other valuable life histories of the fur-bearing\r\nanimals of North America.\r\n\r\n_Rod and Gun in Canada_, a magazine for sportsmen published by W.J.\r\nTaylor, Woodstock, Ontario, contained in 1912 a series of articles on\r\n\"The Culture of Black and Silver Foxes,\" by R.B. and L.V. Croft.\r\n_Country Life in America_ has published a number of illustrated articles\r\non fox and skunk farming.\r\n\r\nWith its usual enterprise and forethought, the Biological Survey of the\r\nDepartment of Agriculture has published a valuable pamphlet of 22 pages\r\non \"Silver Fox Farming,\" by Wilfred H. Osgood, copies of which can be\r\nprocured by addressing the Secretary of Agriculture. In consulting that\r\ncontribution, however, it must be borne in mind that just now, in fox\r\nfarming, history is being made more rapidly than heretofore.\r\n\r\nI do not mean to say that the above are the only sources of information\r\non fur-farming for profit, but they are the ones that have most\r\nimpressed me. The files of all the journals and magazines for sportsmen\r\ncontain numerous articles on this subject, and they should be carefully\r\nconsulted.\r\n\r\nBLACK-FOX FARMING.--The ridiculous prices now being paid in London for\r\nthe skins of black or \"silver\" foxes has created in this country a small\r\nfurore over the breeding of that color-phase of the red fox. The prices\r\nthat actually have been obtained, both for skins and for live animals\r\nfor breeding purposes, have a strong tendency to make people crazy.\r\nFancy paying $12,000 in real money for one pair of live black foxes!\r\nThat has been done, on Prince Edward Island, and $10,000 per pair is now\r\nregarded as a bargain-counter figure.\r\n\r\nOn Prince Edward Island, in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, black-fox breeding\r\nhas been going on for ten years, and is now on a successful basis. One\r\nman has made a fortune in the business, and it is rumored that a stock\r\ncompany is considering the purchase of his ten-acre fox ranch at a\r\nfabulous figure. The enormous prices obtainable for live black foxes,\r\nmale or female, make diamonds and rubies seem cheap and commonplace; and\r\nit is no wonder that enterprising men are tempted to enter that\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\nThe price of a black fox is one of the wonders of a recklessly\r\nextravagant and whimsical age. All the fur-wearing world knows very well\r\nthat fox fur is one of the poorest of furs to withstand the wear and\r\ntear of actual use. About two seasons' hard wear are enough to put the\r\nbest fox skin on the wane, and three or four can be guaranteed to throw\r\nit into the discard. Even the finest black fox skin is nothing\r\nsuperlatively beautiful! A choice \"cross\" fox skin costing only $50 _is\r\nfar more beautiful, as a color proposition_; but London joyously pays\r\n$2,500 or $3,000 for a single black-fox skin, to wear!\r\n\r\nOf course, all such fads as this are as ephemeral as the butterflies of\r\nsummer. The Russo-Japanese war quickly reduced the value of Alaskan blue\r\nfoxes from $30 to $18; and away went the Alaskan fox farms! A similar\r\ntwist of Fortune's fickle wheel may in any year send the black fox out\r\nof royal favor, and remove the bottom from the business of producing it.\r\nLet us hope, however, that the craze for that fur will continue; for we\r\nlike to see our friends and neighbors make good profits.\r\n\r\nPHEASANT REARING.--This subject is so well understood by game-breeders,\r\nand there is already so much good literature available regarding it, it\r\nis not necessary that I should take it up here.\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI\r\n\r\nTEACHING WILD LIFE PROTECTION TO THE YOUNG\r\n\r\n\r\nThousands of busy and burdened men and women are to-day striving hard,\r\nearly and late, to promote measures that will preserve the valuable wild\r\nlife of the world. They desire to leave to the boys and girls of\r\ntomorrow a good showing of the marvelous bird and animal forms that make\r\nthe world beautiful and interesting. They are acting on the principle\r\nthat the wild life of to-day is not ours, to destroy or to keep as we\r\nchoose, but has been given to us _in trust_, partly for our benefit and\r\npartly for those who come after us and audit our accounts. They believe\r\nthat we have no right to squander and destroy a wild-life heritage of\r\npriceless value which we have done nothing to create, and which is not\r\nours to destroy.\r\n\r\n\r\nDUTY OF PARENTS.--This being the case, it is very necessary that the\r\nyoung people of to-day should be taught, early and often, the virtue and\r\nthe necessity of wild-life protection. There is no reason that the boy\r\nof to-day should not take up his share of the common burden, just as\r\nsoon as he is old enough to wander alone through the woods. Let him be\r\ntaught in precise terms that he must _not rob birds' nests_, and that he\r\n_must not shoot song-birds, woodpeckers and kingfishers_ with a\r\n22-calibre rifle, or any other gun. At this moment there lies upon my\r\nside table a vicious little 22-calibre rifle that was taken from two\r\nboys who were camping in the woods of Connecticut, and amusing\r\nthemselves by shooting valuable insectivorous birds. Now those boys were\r\nnot wholly to blame for what they were doing; but their fathers and\r\nmothers were _very much to blame_! They should have been taught at the\r\nparental knee that it is very wrong to kill any bird except a genuine\r\ngame bird, and then only in the lawful open season. Those two fathers\r\npaid $10 each for having failed in their duty; and it served them right;\r\nfor they were the real culprits.\r\n\r\nSmall-calibre rifles are becoming alarmingly common in the hands of\r\nboys. _Parents must do their duty in the training of their boys against\r\nbird-shooting!_ It is a very serious matter. A million boys who roam the\r\nfields with small rifles without having been instructed in protection,\r\ncan destroy an appalling number of valuable birds in the course of a\r\nyear. Some parents are so slavishly devoted to their children that they\r\nwish them to do everything they please, and be checked in nothing. Such\r\nparents constitute one of the pests of society, and a drag upon the\r\nhappiness of their own children! It is now the bounden duty of each\r\nparent to teach each one of his or her children that the time has come\r\nwhen the resources of nature, and especially wild life, must be\r\nconserved. To permit boys to grow up and acquire guns without this\r\nknowledge is very wrong.\r\n\r\nTHE DUTY OF TEACHERS AND SCHOOLS.--A great deal of \"nature study\" is\r\nbeing taught in the public schools of the United States. That the young\r\npeople of our land should be taught to appreciate the works of nature,\r\nand especially animal life and plant life, is very desirable. Thus far,\r\nhowever, there is a screw loose in the system, and that is the shortage\r\nin definite, positive instruction regarding _individual duty_ toward the\r\nwild creatures, great and small. Along with their nature studies all our\r\nschool children should be taught, in the imperative mood:\r\n\r\n1. That it is wrong to disturb breeding birds, or rob birds' nests;\r\n\r\n2. That it is wrong to destroy any harmless living creature not properly\r\nclassed as game, except it be to preserve it in a museum;\r\n\r\n3. That it is no longer right for civilized man to look upon wild game\r\nas _necessary_ food; because there is plenty of other food, and the\r\nremnant of game can not withstand slaughter in that basis;\r\n\r\n4. That the time has come when it is the duty of every good citizen to\r\ntake an active, aggressive part in _preventing_ the destruction of wild\r\nlife, and in _promoting_ its preservation;\r\n\r\n5. That every boy and girl over twelve years of age can do _something_\r\nin this cause, and finally,\r\n\r\n6. That protection and encouragement will bring back the almost vanished\r\nbirds.\r\n\r\nWe call upon all boards of education, all principals of schools and all\r\nteachers to educate our boys and girls, constantly and imperatively,\r\nalong those lines. Teachers, do not say to your pupils,--\"It is right\r\nand nice to protect birds,\" but say:--\"It is your _Duty_ to protect all\r\nharmless wild things, and _you must do it_!\"\r\n\r\nIn a good cause, there is great virtue in \"Must.\"\r\n\r\nReally, we are losing each year an immense amount of available wild-life\r\nprotection. The doctrine of imperative individual duty never yet has\r\nbeen taught in our schools as it should be taught. A few teachers have,\r\nindeed, covered this ground; but I am convinced that their proportion is\r\nmighty small.\r\n\r\nTEXT BOOKS.--The writers of the nature study text books are very much to\r\nblame because nine-tenths of the time this subject has been ignored. The\r\nsituation has not been taken seriously, save in a few cases, by a very\r\nfew authors. I am glad to report that in 1912 there was published a fine\r\ntext book by Professor James W. Peabody, of the Morris High School, New\r\nYork, and Dr. Arthur E. Hunt, in which from beginning to end the duty to\r\nprotect wild life is strongly insisted upon. It is entitled \"Elementary\r\nBiology; Plants, Animals and Man.\"\r\n\r\nHereafter, no zoological or nature study text book should be given a\r\nplace in any school in America unless the author of it has done his full\r\nshare in setting forth the duty of the young citizen toward wild life.\r\nWere I a member of a board of education I would seek to establish and\r\nenforce this requirement. To-day, any author who will presume to write a\r\ntext book of nature study or zoology without knowing and doing his duty\r\ntoward our vanishing fauna, is too ignorant of wild life and too\r\ncareless of his duty toward it, to be accepted as a safe guide for the\r\nyoung. The time for criminal indifference has gone by. Hereafter, every\r\none who is not for the preservation of wild life is against it and it is\r\ntime to separate the sheep from the goats.\r\n\r\nFrom this time forth, the preservation of our fauna should be regarded\r\nas a subject on which every candidate for a teacher's certificate should\r\nundergo an examination before receiving authority to teach in a public\r\nschool. The candidate should be required to know _why_ the preservation\r\nof birds is necessary; why the slaughter of wild life is wrong and\r\ncriminal; the extent to which wild birds and mammals return to us and\r\nthrive under protection; why wild game is no longer a legitimate food\r\nsupply; why wild game should not be sold, and why the feathers of wild\r\nbirds (other than game birds) never should be used as millinery\r\nornaments.\r\n\r\nAs sensible Americans, and somewhat boastful of our intelligence, we\r\nshould put the education of the young in wild-life protection on a\r\nrational business basis.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATE EFFORTS.--In several of our states, systematic efforts to educate\r\nchildren in their duty toward wild life are already being made. To this\r\nend, an annual \"Bird Day\" has been established for state-wide\r\nobservance. This splendid idea is now legally in force in the following\r\nstates:\r\n\r\nCalifornia, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Louisiana, Minnesota, Ohio\r\nand Wisconsin.\r\n\r\nBird Day is also more or less regularly observed, though not legally\r\nprovided for, in New York, Indiana, Colorado and Alabama, and locally in\r\nsome cities of Pennsylvania. Usually the observance of the day is\r\ncombined with that of Arbor Day, and the date is fixed by proclamation\r\nof the Governor.\r\n\r\nAlabama and Wisconsin regularly issue elaborate and beautiful Arbor and\r\nBird Day annuals; and Illinois, and possibly other states, have issued\r\nvery good publications of this character.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PHILLIPS EDUCATIONAL CAMPAIGN FOR THE BIRDS.--Quite recently there\r\nhas come under my notice an episode in the education of school children\r\nthat has given the public profound satisfaction. I cite it here as an\r\nobject lesson for pan-America.\r\n\r\nIn Carrick, Pennsylvania, just across the Monongahela River from the\r\ncity of Pittsburgh, lives John M. Phillips, State Game Commissioner,\r\nnature-lover, sportsman and friend of man. He is a man who does things,\r\nand gets results. Goat Mountain Park (450 square miles), in British\r\nColumbia, to-day owes its existence to him, for without his initiative\r\nand labor it would not have been established. It was the first game\r\npreserve of British Columbia.\r\n\r\nThree years ago, Mr. Phillips became deeply impressed by the idea that\r\none of the best ways in the world to protect the wild life, both of\r\nto-day and the future, would be in teaching school children to love it\r\nand protect it. His fertile brain and open check-book soon devised a\r\nmethod for his home city. His theory was that by giving the children\r\n_something to do_, not only in protecting but in actually _bringing\r\nback_ the birds, much might be accomplished.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BIRD DAY AT CARRICK, PA.\r\nMarching Behind the Governor]\r\n\r\nIn studying the subject of bringing back the birds, he found that the\r\nRussian mulberry is one of the finest trees in the world as a purveyor\r\nof good fruit for many kinds of birds. The tree does not much resemble\r\nour native mulberry, but is equally beautiful and interesting. \"The\r\nfruit is not a long berry, nor is it of a purple color, but it grows\r\nfrom buds on the limbs and twigs something after the manner of the\r\npussy-willow. It is smaller, of light color and has a very distinct\r\nflavor. The most striking peculiarity about the fruit is that it keeps\r\non ripening during two months or more, new berries appearing daily while\r\nothers are ripening. This is why it is such good bird food. Nor is it\r\nhalf bad for folks, for the berries are good to look at and to eat,\r\neither with cream or without, and to make pies that will set any sane\r\nboy's mouth a-watering at sight.\"--(Erasmus Wilson).\r\n\r\nEveryone knows the value of sweet cherries, both to birds and to\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nMr. Phillips decided that he would give away several hundred bird boxes,\r\nand also several hundred sweet cherry and Russian mulberry trees. The\r\nfirst gift distribution was made in the early spring of 1909. Another\r\nfollowed in 1910, but the last one was the most notable.\r\n\r\nOn April 11, 1912, Carrick had a great and glorious Bird Day. Mr.\r\nPhillips was the author of it, and Governor Tener the finisher. On that\r\nday occurred the third annual gift distribution of raw materials\r\ndesigned to promote in the breasts of 2,000 children a love for birds\r\nand an active desire to protect and increase them. Mr. Phillips gave\r\naway 500 bird boxes, 500 sweet cherry trees and 200 mulberry trees. The\r\nsun shone brightly, 500 flags waved in Carrick, the Governor made one of\r\nthe best speeches of his life, and Erasmus Wilson, faithful friend of\r\nthe birds, wrote this good story of the occasion for the _Gazette-Times_\r\nof Pittsburgh:\r\n\r\n  The Governor was there, and the children, the bird-boxes, and the\r\n  young trees. And was there ever a brighter or more fitting day for a\r\n  children and bird jubilee! The scene was so inspiring that Gov.\r\n  Tener made one of the best speeches of his life.\r\n\r\n  The distribution of several hundred cherry and mulberry trees was\r\n  the occasion, and the beautiful grounds of the Roosevelt school,\r\n  Carrick, was the scene.\r\n\r\n  Mr. John M. Phillips, sane sportsman and enthusiastic friend of the\r\n  birds, has been looking forward to this as the culmination of a\r\n  scheme he has been working on for years, and he was more than\r\n  pleased with the outcome. The intense delight it afforded him more\r\n  than repaid him for all it has cost in all the years past.\r\n\r\n  But it was impossible to tell who were the more delighted,--he, or\r\n  the Governor, or the children, or the visitors who were so fortunate\r\n  as to be present. County Superintendent of Schools Samuel Hamilton\r\n  was simply a mass of delight. And how could he be otherwise,\r\n  surrounded as he was by 2,000 and more children fairly quivering\r\n  with delight?\r\n\r\n  Children will care for and defend things that are their very own,\r\n  fight for them and stand guard over them. Realizing this Mr.\r\n  Phillips undertook to show them how they could have birds all their\r\n  own. Being clever in devising schemes for achieving things most to\r\n  be desired, he began giving out bird-boxes to those who would agree\r\n  to put them up, and to watch and defend the birds when they came to\r\n  make their homes with them. And he found that no more faithful\r\n  sentinel ever stood on guard than the boy who had a bird-house all\r\n  his own.\r\n\r\n  Here was the solution to the vexed problem. Provide boxes for those\r\n  who would agree to put them up, care for the birds, and study their\r\n  habits and needs. The children agreed at once, and the birds did not\r\n  object, so Mr. Phillips had some hundreds, four or five, blue-bird\r\n  and wren boxes constructed during the past winter. These were passed\r\n  out some weeks ago to any boys or girls who would present an order\r\n  signed by their parents, and countersigned by the principal of the\r\n  school.\r\n\r\n  He knows enough about a boy to know that he does not prize the\r\n  things that come without effort, nor will he become deeply\r\n  interested in anything for which he is not held more or less\r\n  responsible. Hence the advantage in having him write an order, have\r\n  it indorsed by his parents, and vouched for by his school principal.\r\n\r\n  That he had struck the right scheme was proven by the avidity with\r\n  which the girls and boys rushed for the boxes. The fact that a heavy\r\n  rain was falling did not dampen their ardor for a moment, nor did\r\n  the fact that they were tramping Mr. Phillips' beautiful lawn into a\r\n  field of mud.\r\n\r\n  Mr. Phillips, seeing the necessity of providing food for the\r\n  prospective hosts of birds, and wishing to place the responsibility\r\n  on the boys and girls, offered to provide a cherry tree or mulberry\r\n  tree for every box erected, provided they should be properly planted\r\n  and diligently cared for.\r\n\r\n  This was practically the culmination of the most unique bird scheme\r\n  ever attempted, and yesterday was the day set apart for the\r\n  distribution of these hundreds of fruit trees, the products of which\r\n  are to be divided share and share alike with the birds.\r\n\r\n  Nowhere else has such a scheme been attempted, and never before has\r\n  there been just such a day of jubilee. The intense interest\r\n  manifested by the children, and the earnest enthusiasm manifested,\r\n  leaves no doubt about their carrying out their part of the contract.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DISTRIBUTING BIRD BOXES AND FRUIT TREES]\r\n\r\nUp to date (1912) Mr. Phillips has given away about 1,000 bird boxes,\r\n1,500 cherry and Russian mulberry trees, and transformed the schools of\r\nCarrick into seething masses of children militantly enthusiastic in the\r\nprotection of birds, and in providing them with homes and food. As a\r\nfinal coup, Mr. Phillips has induced the city of Pittsburgh to create\r\nthe office of City Ornithologist, at a salary of $1200 per year. The\r\nduty of the new officer is to protect all birds in the city from all\r\nkinds of molestation, especially when nesting; to erect bird-houses,\r\nprovide food for wild birds, on a large scale, and report annually upon\r\nthe increase or decrease of feathered residents and visitors. Mr.\r\nFrederic S. Webster, long known as a naturalist and practical\r\nornithologist, has been appointed to the position, and is now on active\r\nduty.\r\n\r\nSo far as we are aware, Pittsburgh is the first city to create the\r\noffice of City Ornithologist. It is a happy thought; it will yield good\r\nresults, and other cities will follow Pittsburgh's good example.\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII\r\n\r\nTHE ETHICS OF SPORTSMANSHIP\r\n\r\n\r\nI count it as rather strange that American and English sportsmen have\r\nhunted and shot for a century, and until 1908 formulated practically\r\nnothing to establish and define the ethics of shooting game. Here and\r\nthere, a few unwritten principles have been evolved, and have become\r\nfixed by common consent; but the total number of these is very few.\r\nPerhaps this has been for the reason that every free and independent\r\nsportsman prefers to be a law unto himself. Is it not doubly strange,\r\nhowever, that even down to the present year the term \"sportsmen\" never\r\nhas been defined by a sportsman!\r\n\r\nForty years ago, a sportsman might have been defined, according to the\r\nstandards of that period, as a man who hunts wild game for pleasure.\r\nThose were the days wherein no one foresaw the wholesale annihilation of\r\nspecies, and there were no wilderness game preserves. In those days,\r\ngentlemen shot female hoofed game, trapped bears if they felt like it,\r\nkilled ten times as much big game as they could use, and no one made any\r\nfuss whatever about the waste or extermination of wild life.\r\n\r\nThose were the days of ox-teams and broad-axes. To-day, we are living in\r\na totally different world,--a world of grinding, crunching, pulverizing\r\nprogress, a world of annihilation of the works of Nature. And what is a\r\nsportsman to-day?\r\n\r\nA SPORTSMAN is a man who loves Nature, and who in the enjoyment of the\r\noutdoor life and exploration takes a reasonable toll of Nature's wild\r\nanimals, but not for commercial profit, and only so long as his hunting\r\ndoes not promote the extermination of species.\r\n\r\nIn view of the disappearance of wild life all over the habitable globe,\r\nand the steady extermination of species, the ethics of sportsmanship has\r\nbecome a matter of tremendous importance. If a man can shoot the last\r\nliving Burchell zebra, or prong-horned antelope, and be a sportsman and\r\na gentleman, then we may just as well drop down all bars, and say no\r\nmore about the ethics of shooting game.\r\n\r\nBut the real gentlemen-sportsmen of the world are not insensible to the\r\nduties of the hour in regard to the taking or not taking of game. The\r\ntime has come when canon laws should be laid down, of world-wide\r\napplication, and so thoroughly accepted and promulgated that their\r\nbinding force can not be ignored. Among other things, it is time for a\r\nlist of species to be published which no man claiming to be either a\r\ngentleman or a sportsman can shoot for aught else than preservation in a\r\npublic museum. Of course, this list would be composed of the species\r\nthat are threatened with extermination. Of American animals it should\r\ninclude the prong-horned antelope, Mexican mountain sheep, all the\r\nmountain sheep and goats in the United States, the California grizzly\r\nbear, mule deer, West Indian seal and California elephant seal and\r\nwalrus.\r\n\r\nIn Africa that list should include the eland, white rhinoceros,\r\nblessbok, bontebok, kudu, giraffes and southern elephants, sable\r\nantelope, rhinoceros south of the Zambesi, leucoryx antelope and\r\nwhale-headed stork. In Asia it should include the great Indian\r\nrhinoceros and its allied species, the burrhel, the Nilgiri tahr and the\r\ngayal. The David deer of Manchuria already is extinct in a wild state.\r\n\r\nIn Australia the interdiction should include the thylacine or Tasmanian\r\nwolf, all the large kangaroos, the emu, lyre bird and the mallee-bird.\r\n\r\nThink what it would mean to the species named above if all the sportsmen\r\nof the world would unite in their defense, both actively and passively!\r\nIt would be to those species a modus vivendi worth while.\r\n\r\nPrior to 1908, no effort (so far as we are aware) ever had been made to\r\npromote the establishment of a comprehensive and up-to-date code of\r\nethics for sportsmen who shoot. A few clubs of men who are hunters of\r\nbig game had expressed in their constitutions a few brief principles for\r\nthe purpose of standardizing their own respective memberships, but that\r\nwas all. I have not taken pains to make a general canvass of sportsmen's\r\nclubs to ascertain what rules have been laid down by any large number of\r\norganizations.\r\n\r\nThe Boone and Crockett Club, of New York and Washington, had in its\r\nconstitution the following excellent article:\r\n\r\n\"Article X. The use of steel traps, the making of large bags, the\r\nkilling of game while swimming in water, or helpless in deep snow, and\r\nthe unnecessary killing of females or young of any species of ruminant,\r\nshall be deemed offenses. Any member who shall commit such offenses may\r\nbe suspended, or expelled from the Club by unanimous vote of the\r\nExecutive Committee.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1906, this Club condemned the use of automatic shotguns in hunting as\r\nunsportsmanlike.\r\n\r\nThe Lewis and Clark Club, of Pittsburgh, has in its constitution, as\r\nSection 3 of Article 3, the following comprehensive principle:\r\n\r\n\"The term 'legitimate sport' means not only the observance of local\r\nlaws, but excludes all methods of taking game other than by fair\r\nstalking or still hunting.\"\r\n\r\nAt the end of the constitution of this club is this declaration, and\r\nadmonition:\r\n\r\n\"_Purchase and sale of Trophies_.--As the purchase of heads and horns\r\nestablishes a market value, and encourages Indians and others to \"shoot\r\nfor sale,\" often in violation of local laws and always to the detriment\r\nof the protection of game for legitimate sport, the Lewis and Clark Club\r\ncondemns the purchase or the sale of the heads or horns of any game.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1906 the Lewis and Clark Club condemned the use of automatic\r\nshotguns as unsportsmanlike.\r\n\r\nThe Shikar Club, of London, a club which contains all the big-game\r\nhunters of the nobility and gentry of England,[Q] and of which His\r\nMajesty King George is Honorary President, has declared the leading\r\nfeature of its \"Objects\" in the following terms:\r\n\r\n\"To maintain the standard of sportsmanship. It is not squandered bullets\r\nand swollen bags which appeal to us. The test is rather in a love of\r\nforest, mountains and desert; in acquired knowledge of the habits of\r\nanimals; in the strenuous pursuit of a wary and dangerous quarry; in the\r\ninstinct for a well-devised approach to a fair shooting distance; and in\r\nthe patient retrieve of a wounded animal.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote Q: This organization contains in its list of members the most\r\ndistinguished names in the modern annals of British sport and\r\nexploration. Its honorary membership, of eight persons, contains the\r\nnames of three Americans: Theodore Roosevelt, Madison Grant and W.T.\r\nHornaday; and of this fact at least one person is extremely proud!]\r\n\r\nIn 1908 the Camp-Fire Club of America formally adopted, as its code of\r\nethics, the \"Sportsman's Platform\" of fifteen articles that was prepared\r\nby the writer and placed before the sportsmen of America, Great Britain\r\nand her colonial dependencies in that year. In the book of the Club it\r\nregularly appears as follows:\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nCODE OF ETHICS\r\nOF THE\r\nCAMP-FIRE CLUB OF AMERICA\r\n_Proposed by Wm. T. Hornaday and adopted December 10, 1908_\r\n\r\n  1. The wild animal life of to-day is not ours, to do with as we\r\n  please. The original stock is given to us _in trust_, for the\r\n  benefit both of the present and the future. We must render an\r\n  accounting of this trust to those who come after us.\r\n\r\n  2. Judging from the rate at which the wild creatures of North\r\n  America are now being destroyed, fifty years hence there will be no\r\n  large game left in the United States nor in Canada, outside of\r\n  rigidly protected game preserves. It is therefore the duty of every\r\n  good citizen to promote the protection of forests and wild life and\r\n  the creation of game preserves, while a supply of game remains.\r\n  Every man who finds pleasure in hunting or fishing should be willing\r\n  to spend both time and money in active work for the protection of\r\n  forests, fish and game.\r\n\r\n  3. The sale of game is incompatible with the perpetual preservation\r\n  of a proper stock of game; therefore it should be prohibited by laws\r\n  and by public sentiment.\r\n\r\n  4. In the settled and civilized regions of North America there is no\r\n  real _necessity_ for the consumption of wild game as human food: nor\r\n  is there any good excuse for the sale of game for food purposes. The\r\n  maintenance of hired laborers on wild game should be prohibited\r\n  everywhere, under severe penalties.\r\n\r\n  5. An Indian has no more right to kill wild game, or to subsist upon\r\n  it all the year round, than any white man in the same locality. The\r\n  Indian has no inherent or God-given ownership of the game of North\r\n  America, anymore than of its mineral resources; and he should be\r\n  governed by the same game laws as white men.\r\n\r\n  6. No man can be a good citizen and also be a slaughterer of game or\r\n  fishes beyond the narrow limits compatible with high-class\r\n  sportsmanship.\r\n\r\n  7. A game-butcher or a market-hunter is an undesirable citizen, and\r\n  should be treated as such.\r\n\r\n  8. The highest purpose which the killing of wild game and game\r\n  fishes can hereafter be made to serve is in furnishing objects to\r\n  overworked men for tramping and camping trips in the wilds; and the\r\n  value of wild game as human food should no longer be regarded as an\r\n  important factor in its pursuit.\r\n\r\n  9. If rightly conserved, wild game constitutes a valuable asset to\r\n  any country which possesses it; and it is good statesmanship to\r\n  protect it.\r\n\r\n  10. An ideal hunting trip consists of a good comrade, fine country,\r\n  and a _very few_ trophies per hunter.\r\n\r\n  11. In an ideal hunting trip, the death of the game is only an\r\n  incident; and by no means is it really necessary to a successful\r\n  outing.\r\n\r\n  12. The best hunter is the man who finds the most game, kills the\r\n  least, and leaves behind him no wounded animals.\r\n\r\n  13. The killing of an animal means the end of its most interesting\r\n  period. When the country is fine, pursuit is more interesting than\r\n  possession.\r\n\r\n  14. The killing of a female hoofed animal, save for special\r\n  preservation, is to be regarded as incompatible with the highest\r\n  sportsmanship; and it should everywhere be prohibited by stringent\r\n  laws.\r\n\r\n  15. A particularly fine photograph of a large wild animal in its\r\n  haunts is entitled to more credit than the dead trophy of a similar\r\n  animal. An animal that has been photographed never should be killed,\r\n  unless previously wounded in the chase.\r\n\r\nThis platform has been adopted as a code of ethics by the following\r\norganizations, besides the Camp-Fire Club of America:\r\n\r\nThe Lewis and Clark Club, of Pittsburgh, John M. Phillips, President.\r\n\r\nThe North American Fish and Game Protective Association (International)\r\n\r\nMassachusetts Fish and Game Protective Association, Boston.\r\n\r\nCamp-Fire Club of Michigan, Detroit.\r\n\r\nRod and Gun Club, Sheridan County, Wyoming.\r\n\r\nThe platform has been endorsed and published by The Society for the\r\nPreservation of the Wild Fauna of the British Empire (London), which is\r\nan endorsement of far-reaching importance.\r\n\r\nMajor J. Stevenson-Hamilton, C.M.Z.S., Warden of the Government Game\r\nReserves of the Transvaal, South Africa, has adopted the platform and\r\ngiven it the most effective endorsement that it has received from any\r\nsingle individual. In his great work on game protection in Africa and\r\nwild-animal lore, entitled \"Animal Life in Africa\" (and \"very highly\r\ncommended\" by the Committee on Literary Honors of the Camp-Fire Club),\r\nhe publishes the entire platform, with a depth and cordiality of\r\nendorsement that is bound to warm the heart of every man who believes in\r\nthe principles laid down in that document. He says, \"It should be\r\nprinted on the back of every license that is issued for hunting in\r\nAfrica.\"\r\n\r\nI am profoundly impressed by the fact that it is high time for sportsmen\r\nall over the world to take to heart the vital necessity of adopting high\r\nand clearly defined codes of ethics, to suit the needs of the present\r\nhour. The days of game abundance, and the careless treatment of wild\r\nlife have gone by, never to return.\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII\r\n\r\nTHE DUTY OF AMERICAN ZOOLOGISTS AND EDUCATORS TO AMERICAN WILD LIFE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe publication of this chapter will hardly be regarded as a bid for\r\nfame, or even popularity, on the part of the author. However, the\r\nsubject can not be ignored simply because it is disagreeable.\r\n\r\nThroughout sixty years, to go no further back, the people of America\r\nhave been witnessing the strange spectacle of American zoologists, as a\r\nmass, so intent upon the academic study of our continental fauna that\r\nthey seem not to have cared a continental about the destruction of that\r\nfauna.\r\n\r\nDuring that tragic period twelve species of North American birds have\r\nbeen totally exterminated, twenty-three are almost exterminated, and the\r\nmammals have fared very badly.\r\n\r\nIf \"by their works ye shall know them,\" then no man can say that the men\r\nreferred to have been conspicuous on the firing line in defense of\r\nassaulted wild life. In their hearts, we know that in an academic way\r\nthe naturalists of America do care about wild-life slaughter, and the\r\nextermination of species; and we also know that perhaps fifty American\r\nzoologists have at times taken an active and serious interest in\r\nprotection work.\r\n\r\nI am speaking now of the general body of museum directors and curators;\r\nprofessors and teachers of zoology in our institutions of learning--a\r\nlegion in themselves; teachers of nature study in our secondary schools;\r\ninvestigators and specialists in state and government service; the\r\ntaxidermists and osteologists; and the array of literary people who,\r\nlike all the foregoing, _make their bread and butter out of the\r\nexploitation of wild life_.\r\n\r\nTaken as a whole, the people named above constitute a grand army of at\r\nleast five thousand trained, educated, resourceful and influential\r\npersons. They all _depend upon wild life for their livelihood_. When\r\nthey talk about living things, the public listens with respectful\r\nattention. Their knowledge of the value of wild life would be worth\r\nsomething to our cause; but thus far it never has been capitalized!\r\n\r\nThese people are hard workers; and when they mark out definite courses\r\nand attainable goals, they know how to get results. Yet what do we see?\r\n\r\nFor sixty long years, with the exception of the work of a corporal's\r\nguard of their number, this grand army has remained in camp, partly\r\nneglecting and partly refusing to move upon the works of the enemy. For\r\nsixty years, with the exception of the non-game-bird law, as a class and\r\na mass they have left to the sportsmen of the country the dictating of\r\nlaws for the protection of all the game birds, the mammals and the game\r\nfishes. When we stop to consider that the game birds alone embrace _154\r\nvery important species_, the appalling extent to which the zoologist has\r\nabdicated in favor of the sportsman becomes apparent.\r\n\r\nIt is a very great mistake, and a wrong besides, for the zoologists of\r\nthe country to abandon the game birds, mammals and fishes of North\r\nAmerica to the sportsmen, to do with as they please! Yet that is\r\npractically what has been done.\r\n\r\nThe time was, thirty or forty years ago, when wild life was so abundant\r\nthat we did not need to worry about its preservation. That was the\r\ngolden era of study and investigation. That era ended definitely in\r\n1884, with the practical extermination of the wild American bison,\r\npartly through the shameful greed and partly through the neglect of the\r\nAmerican people. We are now living _in the middle of the period of\r\nExtermination!_ The questions for every American zoologist and every\r\nsportsman to answer now are: Shall the slaughter of species go on to a\r\nquick end of the period? Shall we give posterity a birdless, gameless,\r\nfishless continent, or not? Shall we have close seasons, all over the\r\ncountry, for five or ten years, or for five hundred years?\r\n\r\nIf we are courageous, we will brace up and answer these questions now,\r\nlike men. If we are faint-hearted, and eager for peace at any price,\r\nthen we will sidestep the ugly situation until the destroyers have\r\nsettled it for us by the wholesale extermination of species.\r\n\r\nIf the zoologist cares to know, then I will tell him that to-day the\r\nwild life of the world _can_ be saved by law, but _not by sentiment\r\nalone!_ You cannot \"educate\" a poacher, a game-hog, a market-gunner, a\r\nmilliner or a vain and foolish woman of fashion. All these must be\r\ncurbed and controlled _by law_. Game refuges alone will not save the\r\nwild life! _All_ species of birds, mammals and game fishes of North\r\nAmerica must have more thorough and far-reaching protection than they\r\nnow have.\r\n\r\nDo not always take your cue from the sportsmen, especially regarding the\r\nenactment of long close seasons! If you need good advice, or help about\r\ndrafting a bill, write to Dr. T.S. Palmer, Department of Agriculture,\r\nWashington, and you will receive prompt and valuable assistance. The\r\nDoctor is a wise man, and there is nothing about protective laws that is\r\nunknown to him. Go to _your_ state senator and _your_ assemblyman with\r\nthe bills that you know should be enacted into law, and assure them that\r\nthose measures are necessary for the wild life, and beneficial to 98 per\r\ncent of the people _who own the wild life_. You will be heard with\r\nrespectful attention, in any law-making body that you choose to enter.\r\n\r\nPeople who cannot give time and labor must supply you with money for\r\nyour campaigns. _Ask_, and you will receive! I have proven this many\r\ntimes. With care and exactness account to your subscribers for the\r\nexpenditure of all money placed in your hands, and you will receive\r\ncontinuous support.\r\n\r\nIn times of great stress, print circulars and leaflets by the\r\nten-thousand, and get them into the hands of the People, calling for\r\n_their_ help. Our 42,000 copies of the \"Wild Life Call\" (sixteen pages)\r\nwere distributed by organizations all over the state of New York, and\r\nalong with Mr. Andrew D. Meloy's letters to the members of the New York\r\nState League, aroused such a tidal wave of public sentiment against the\r\nsale of game that the Bayne bill was finally swept through the\r\nLegislature with only one dissenting vote! And yet, in the beginning not\r\none man dared to hope that that very revolutionary measure could by any\r\npossibility be passed in its first year in New York State, even if it\r\never could be!\r\n\r\nIt was the aroused Public that did it!\r\n\r\nThis volume has been written (under great pressure) in order to put the\r\nwhole situation before the people of America, including the zoologists,\r\nand to give them some definite information, state by state, regarding\r\nthe needs of the hour. Look at the needs of your own state, in the \"Roll\r\nCall of States,\" and you will find work for your hand to do. Clear your\r\nconscience by taking hold now, to do everything that you can to stop the\r\ncarnage and preserve the remnant. Twenty-five or fifty years hence, if\r\nwe have a birdless and gameless continent, let it not be said that the\r\nzoologists of America helped to bring it about by wicked apathy.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture, a brief survey of the attitude toward wild life of\r\ncertain American institutions of national reputation will be decidedly\r\npertinent. I shall mention only a few of the many that through their\r\ncharacter and position owe specific duties to this cause. _Noblesse\r\noblige_!\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nThe Biological Survey of the U.S. Department of Agriculture is a\r\nsplendid center of activity and initiative in the preservation of our\r\nwild life. The work of Dr. T.S. Palmer has already been spoken of, and\r\nthanks to his efforts and direction, the Survey has become the\r\nrecognized special champion of preservation in America.\r\n\r\nThe U.S. Forestry Bureau is developing into a very valuable ally, and we\r\nconfidently look forward to the time when its influence in preservation\r\nwill be a hundred times more potent than it is to-day. _That will be\r\nwhen every national forest is made a game preserve, and every forest\r\nranger is made a game warden_. Let us have both those developments, and\r\nquickly.\r\n\r\nIn 1896 the AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY became a center of\r\nactivity in bird protection, and the headquarters of the New York State\r\nAudubon Society. The president of the Museum (Professor Henry Fairfield\r\nOsborn) is also the president of that organization.\r\n\r\nIn several of the New York State movements for bird conservation,\r\nespecially those bearing on the plumage law, the American Museum has\r\nbeen active, and at times conspicuous. No one (so I believe) ever\r\nappealed to the President of the Museum for help on the firing line\r\nwithout receiving help of some kind. Unfortunately, however, the\r\npreservation of wild life is not one of the declared objects of the\r\nAmerican Museum corporation, or one on which its officers may spend\r\nmoney, as is so freely and even joyously done by the Zoological Society.\r\nThe Museum's influence has been exerted chiefly through the active\r\nworkers of the State Audubon Society, and it was as president of that\r\nbody that Professor Osborn subscribed to the fund that was so largely\r\ninstrumental in creating the New York law against the sale of game.\r\n\r\nThere is room for an important improvement in the declared objects of\r\nthe American Museum. To the cause of protection it is a distinct loss\r\nthat that great and powerful institution should be unable to spend any\r\nmoney in promoting the preservation of our fauna from annihilation. An\r\namendment to its constitution is earnestly recommended.\r\n\r\nThe activities of the NEW YORK ZOOLOGICAL SOCIETY began in 1896, and\r\nthey do not require comment here. They have been continuous, aggressive\r\nand far-reaching, and they have been supported by thousands of dollars\r\nfrom the Society's treasury. It is true that the funds available for\r\nprotection work have not represented a great annual sum, such as the\r\nwork demands, but the amount being expended from year to year is\r\nsteadily increasing. In serious emergencies there is _always something\r\navailable_! During the past two years, to relieve the Society of a\r\nportion of this particular burden, the director of the Park secured\r\nseveral large subscriptions from persons outside the Society, who\r\npreviously had never entered into this work.\r\n\r\nThe MILWAUKEE PUBLIC MUSEUM has entered actively and effectively into\r\nthe fight to preserve the birds of Wisconsin from annihilation by the\r\nsaloon-loafer element that three years ago determined to repeal the best\r\nbird laws on the books, and throw the shooting privilege wide open. Mr.\r\nHenry L. Ward, Director of the Museum, went to the firing line, and\r\nremained there. Last year the saloon element thought that they had a\r\nlarge majority of the votes in the legislature pledged to vote their\r\nway. It looked like it; but when the decent people again rose and\r\ndemanded justice for the birds, the members of the legislature stood by\r\nthem in large majorities. The spring-shooting, bag-limit and\r\nhunting-license laws were _not_ repealed.\r\n\r\nTHE UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS (Lawrence) scored heavily for the cause of\r\nwild-life protection when in 1908 it gave to the Governor of the state\r\nthe services of a member of its faculty, Professor Lewis Lindsay Dyche,\r\nwho was wanted to fill the position of State Fish and Game Commissioner.\r\nProfessor Dyche proved to be a very live wire, and his activities have\r\ncovered the State of Kansas to its farthest corners. We love him for the\r\nhost of enemies he has made--among the poachers, game-butchers,\r\npseudo-\"sportsmen\" and lawbreakers generally. The men who thought they\r\nhad the \"pull\" of friendship for lawbreaking were first warned, and then\r\nas second offenders hauled up to the bar, one and all. The more the\r\ndestroyers try to hound the Commissioner, the more popular is he with\r\nthe great, solid mass of good citizens who believe in the saving of wild\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nTHE MUSEUM OF COMPARATIVE ZOOLOGY has at last made a beginning in the\r\nfield of protection. Last winter, while the great battle raged over the\r\nWharton no-sale-of-game bill, several members of the Museum staff\r\nappeared at the hearings and otherwise worked for the success of the\r\nmeasure. It was most timely aid,--and very much needed. It is to be\r\nhoped that that auspicious beginning will be continued from year to\r\nyear. The Museum should keep at least one good fighter constantly in the\r\nfield.\r\n\r\nTHE BOSTON SOCIETY OF NATURAL HISTORY takes a very active part in\r\npromoting the preservation of the fauna of Massachusetts, and in\r\nresisting the attempts of the destroyers to repeal the excellent laws\r\nnow in force. Its members put forth vigorous efforts in the great\r\ncampaign of 1912.\r\n\r\nTHE BROOKLYN INSTITUTE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES is well represented in the\r\nfield of protection by Director Franklin W. Hooper, now president of the\r\nAmerican Bison Society, and an earnest promoter of the perpetuation of\r\nthe bison. When, the Wind Cave National Bison Herd is fully established,\r\nin South Dakota, as it practically _is already_, the chief credit for\r\nthat coup will be due to the unflagging energy and persistence of\r\nProfessor Hooper.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BUFFALO ACADEMY OF SCIENCES in 1911 entered actively and\r\neffectively, under the leadership of Dr. Lee H. Smith, into the campaign\r\nfor the Bayne bill. Besides splendid service rendered in western New\r\nYork, Dr. Smith appeared in Albany with a strong delegation in support\r\nof the bill.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA was the first institution of learning to\r\nenter the field of wild-life protection for active, aggressive and\r\npermanent work. W.L. Taylor and Joseph Grinnell, of the University\r\nMuseum, have taken up the fight to save the fauna of California from the\r\ndangers that now threaten it.\r\n\r\nAt this point our enumeration of the activities of American zoological\r\ninstitutions comes to an unfortunate end. There are many individuals to\r\nbe named elsewhere, in the roll of honor, but that is another story. I\r\nam now going to set before the public the names of certain institutions\r\nlargely devoted to zoology and permeated by zoologists, which thus far\r\nseem to have entirely ignored the needs of our fauna, and which so far\r\nwe know have contributed neither men, money nor encouragement to the\r\nArmy of the Defense.\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nPARTIAL LIST OF INSTITUTIONS OWING SERVICE TO WILD LIFE.\r\n\r\n_The United States National Museum_ contains a large and expensive corps\r\nof zoological curators and assistant curators, some of whom long ago\r\nshould have taken upon themselves the task of reforming the laws of the\r\nDistrict of Columbia, Virginia and Maryland, at their very doors! This\r\nmuseum should maintain at least one man in the field of protection, and\r\nthe existence of the Biological Survey is no excuse for the Museum's\r\ninactivity.\r\n\r\n_The Field Museum_ of Chicago is a great institution, but it appears to\r\nbe inactive in wild-life protection, and indifferent to the fate of our\r\nwild life. Its influence is greatly needed on the firing line,\r\nespecially in Illinois, Wisconsin, Iowa and northern Minnesota. First of\r\nall the odious sale-of-game situation in Chicago should be cleaned up!\r\n\r\n_The Philadelphia Academy of Sciences_ has been represented on the\r\nA.O.U. Committee on Bird Protection by Mr. Witmer Stone. The time has\r\ncome when this Academy should be represented on the firing line as a\r\nvirile, wide-awake, self-sacrificing and aggressive force. It is perhaps\r\nthe oldest zoological body in the United States! Its scientific standing\r\nis unquestioned. Its members _must_ know of the carnage that is going on\r\naround them, for they are not ignorant men. The Pennsylvania State Game\r\nCommission to-day stands in urgent need of active, vigorous and\r\npersistent assistance from the Philadelphia Academy in the fierce\r\ncampaign already in progress for additional protective laws. Will that\r\nhelp be given?\r\n\r\n_The Carnegie Institute_ of Washington (endowment $22,000,000)\r\nunquestionably owes a great duty toward wild life, no portion of which\r\nhas yet been discharged. Academic research work is all very well, but it\r\ndoes not save faunas from annihilation. In the saving of the birds and\r\nmammals of North America a hundred million people are directly\r\ninterested, and the cause is starving for money, men and publicity.\r\nEducation is not the ONLY duty of educators!\r\n\r\n_The Carnegie Museum_ at Pittsburgh should be provided by Pittsburgh\r\nwith sufficient funds that its Director can put a good man into the\r\nfield of protection, and maintain his activities. The State of\r\nPennsylvania, and the nation at large, needs such a worker at\r\nPittsburgh; and this statement is not open to argument!\r\n\r\n  The California Academy of Sciences;      |\r\n  The Chicago Academy of Sciences;         | Appear to have done nothing\r\n  The New York Academy of Sciences;        |  noteworthy in promoting\r\n  The National Academy of Sciences;        |  the preservation and increase\r\n  The Rochester Academy of Sciences;       |  of the wild life of America.\r\n  The Philadelphia Zoological Society;     |\r\n  The National Zoological Park;            |\r\n\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nA FEW OF THE INSTITUTIONS OF LEARNING WHICH SHOULD EACH DEVOTE ONE MAN\r\nTO THIS CAUSE.\r\n\r\n_Columbia University_, of New York, has a very large and strong corps of\r\nzoological professors in its Department of Biology. No living organism\r\nis too small or too worthless to be studied by high-grade men; but does\r\nany man of Columbia ever raise his voice, actively and determinedly, for\r\nthe preservation of our fauna, or any other fauna? Columbia should give\r\nthe services of one man wholly to this cause.\r\n\r\nThere are men whose zoological ideals soar so high that they can not see\r\nthe slaughter of wild creatures that is so furiously proceeding on the\r\nsurface of this blood-stained earth. We don't want to hear about the\r\n\"behavior\" of protozoans while our best song birds are being\r\nexterminated by negroes and poor whites.\r\n\r\n_Cornell University_ should now awaken to the new situation. All the\r\nzoological Neros should not fiddle while Rome burns. For the sake of\r\nconsistency, Cornell should devote the services of at least one member\r\nof its large and able faculty to the cause of wild-life protection.\r\nCornell was a pioneer in forestry teaching; and why should she not lead\r\noff now in the new field?\r\n\r\n_Yale University_, in Professor James W. Toumey, Director of the School\r\nof Forestry, possesses a natural, ready-made protector of wild life.\r\nFrom forestry to wild life is an easy step. We hopefully look forward to\r\nthe development of Professor Toumey into a militant protectionist,\r\nfighting for the helpless creatures that _must_ be protected by man _or\r\nperish_! If Yale is willing to set a new pace for the world's great\r\nuniversities, she has the Man ready at hand.\r\n\r\n_The University of Chicago_ should become the center of a great new\r\nprotectionist movement which should cover the whole Middle West area,\r\nfrom the plains to Pittsburgh. This is the inflexible, logical necessity\r\nof the hour. _Either protect zoology, or else for very shame give up\r\nteaching it_!\r\n\r\n_Every higher institution of learning in America now has a duty in this\r\nmatter_. Times have changed. Things are not as they were thirty years\r\nago. To allow a great and valuable wild fauna to be destroyed and wasted\r\nis a crime, against both the present and the future. If we mean to be\r\ngood citizens we cannot shirk the duty to conserve. We are trustees of\r\nthe inheritance of future generations, and we have no right to squander\r\nthat inheritance. If we fail of our plain duty, the scorn of future\r\ngenerations surely will be our portion.\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV\r\n\r\nTHE GREATEST NEEDS OF THE WILD-LIFE CAUSE AND THE DUTY OF THE HOUR\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fate of wild life in North America hangs to-day by three very\r\nslender threads, the names of which you will hardly guess unaided. They\r\nare Labor, Money and Publicity! The threads are slender because there is\r\nso little raw material in them.\r\n\r\nWe do not need money with which to \"buy votes\" or \"influence,\" but money\r\nwith which to pay workers; to publish things to arouse the American\r\npeople; to sting sportsmen into action; to hire wardens; to prosecute\r\ngame-hogs and buy refuges for wild life. If a sufficient amount of money\r\nfor these purposes cannot be procured, then as sure as the earth\r\ncontinues to revolve, our wild life will pass away, forever.\r\n\r\nThis is no cause for surprise, or wonder. In this twentieth century\r\nmoney is essential to every great enterprise, whether it be for virtue\r\nor mischief. The enemies of wild life, and the people who support them,\r\nare very powerful. The man whose pocket or whose personal privilege is\r\nthreatened by new legislation is prompted by business reasons to work\r\nagainst you, and spend money in protecting his interests.\r\n\r\nNow, it happens that the men of ordinary means who have nothing personal\r\nat stake in the preservation of wild life save sentimental\r\nconsiderations, cannot afford to leave their business more than three or\r\nfour days each year on protection affairs. Yet many times services are\r\ndemanded for many days, or even weeks together, in order to accomplish\r\nresults. Bad repeal bills must be fought until they are dead; and good\r\nprotective bills must be supported until the breath of life is breathed\r\ninto them by the executive signature.\r\n\r\nWith money in hand, good men aways can be found who will work in game\r\nprotection for about one-half what they would demand in other pursuits.\r\nWith the men _whom, you really desire_, sentiment is always a\r\ncontrolling factor. It is my inflexible rule, however, in asking for\r\nservices, that men who give valuable time and strength to the cause\r\nshall not be allowed to take their expense money from their own pockets.\r\nSoldiers on the firing line _cannot_ provide the sinews of war that come\r\nfrom the paymaster's chest!\r\n\r\nCampaigns of publicity are matters of tremendous necessity and\r\nimportance; but their successful promotion requires hundreds, or\r\npossibly thousands of dollars, for each state that is covered.\r\n\r\nI believe that the wealthy men and women of America are the most liberal\r\ngivers for the benefit of humanity that can be found in all the world.\r\nNew York especially contains a great number of men who year in and year\r\nout work hard for money--in order to give it away! The depth and breadth\r\nof the philanthropic spirit in New York City is to me the most\r\nsurprising of all the strange impulses that sway the inhabitants of that\r\nseething mass of mixed humanity. Every imaginable cause for the benefit\r\nof mankind,--save one,--has received, and still is receiving, millions\r\nof gift dollars.\r\n\r\nSome enterprises for the transcendant education of the people are at\r\nthis moment hopelessly wallowing in the excess of wealth that has been\r\nthrust upon them. Men are being hired at high salaries to help spend\r\nwealth in high, higher, highest education and research. It is now\r\nfashionable to bequeath millions to certain causes that do not need them\r\nin the least! In education there is a mad scramble to educate every\r\nyoung man to the topmost notch, often far above his probable station in\r\nlife, and into tastes and wants far beyond his powers to maintain.\r\n\r\nIn all this, however, there would be no cause for regret if the wild\r\nlife of our continent were not in such a grievous state. If we felt no\r\nconscience burden for those who come after us, we would not care where\r\nthe millions go; but since things are as they are, it is heartbreaking\r\nto see the cause of wild-life protection actually starving, or at the\r\nbest subsisting only on financial husks and crumbs, while less important\r\ncauses literally flounder in surplus wealth.\r\n\r\nThis regret is intensified by the knowledge that _in no other cause for\r\nthe conservation of the resources most valuable to mankind will a dollar\r\ngo so far, or bring back such good results, as in the preservation of\r\nwild life!_ The promotion of \"the Bayne bill\" and the enactment of the\r\nBayne law is a fair example. That law is to-day on the statute books of\r\nthe State of New York because fifty men and women promptly subscribed\r\n$5,000 to a fund formed with special reference to the expenses of the\r\ncampaign for that measure; and the uplift of that victory will be felt\r\nfor years to come, just as it already has been in Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nAt one time I was tempted to show the financial skeleton in the closet\r\nof wild-life protection, by inserting here a statement of the funds\r\navailable to be expended by all the New York organizations during the\r\ncampaign year of 1911-1912. But I cannot do it. The showing is too\r\npainful, too humiliating. From it our enemies would derive too much\r\ncomfort.\r\n\r\nEven in New York State, in view of the great interests at stake, the\r\nshowing is pitiful. But what shall we say of Massachusetts,\r\nPennsylvania, Connecticut, New Jersey, and a dozen other states where\r\nthe situation is much worse? In the winter of 1912 a cry for help came\r\nto us from a neighboring state, where a terrific fight was being made by\r\nthe forces of destruction against all reform measures, and in behalf of\r\nretrogression on spring shooting. The appeal said: \"The situation in our\r\nlegislature is the worst that it has been in years. Our enemies are very\r\nstrong, well organized, and they fight us at every step. We have _no\r\nfunds_, and we are expected to make bricks without straw! Is there not\r\n_something_ that you can do to help us?\"\r\n\r\nThere was!\r\n\r\nOnly one week previously, a good friend (who declines to be named) gave\r\nus _two thousand dollars_, of real money, for just such emergencies.\r\n\r\nWithin thirty-six hours an entirely new fighting force had been\r\norganized and equipped for service. Within one week, those\r\nreinforcements had made a profound impression on the defenses of the\r\nenemy, and in the end the great fight was won. Of our small campaign\r\nfund it took away over one thousand dollars; but the victory was worth\r\nit.\r\n\r\nWith money enough,--a reasonable sum,--the birds of North America, and\r\nsome of the small-mammal species also, can be saved. The big game that\r\nis hunted and killed outside the game preserves, and outside of such\r\nplaces as New Brunswick and the Adirondacks, can _not_ be saved--until\r\n_each species_ is given perpetual protection. Colorado is saving a small\r\nremnant of her mountain sheep, but Montana and Wyoming are wasting\r\ntheirs, because they allow killing, and the killers are ten times too\r\nnumerous for the sheep. They imagine that by permitting only the killing\r\nof rams they are saving the species; but that is an absolute fallacy,\r\nand soon it will have a fatal ending.\r\n\r\nWith an endowment fund of $2,000,000 (only double the price of the two\r\nold Velasquez paintings purchased recently by a gentleman of New York!)\r\na very good remnant of the wild life of North America could be saved.\r\n\r\nBut who will give the fund, or even a quarter of it?\r\n\r\nThus far, the largest sums ever given in America for the cause of\r\nwild-life protection, so far as I know personally, have been the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\nAlbert Wilcox, to the National Association of Audubon Societies,  $322,000\r\nMary Butcher Fund, to the National Association of Audubon\r\n    Societies                                                       12,000\r\nMrs. Russell Sage, for the purchase of Marsh Island                150,000\r\nAmerican Game Protective and Propagation Association, from\r\n    the manufacturers of firearms and ammunition, annually          25,000\r\nCharles Willis Ward and E.A. McIlhenny, purchase of game\r\n    preserve presented to Louisiana                                 39,000\r\nMrs. Russell Sage, miscellaneous gifts to the National Audubon\r\n    Society                                                         20,000\r\nThe American Bison Society for the Montana National Herd            10,526\r\nNew York Zoological Society, total about                            20,000\r\nJohn E. Thayer, purchase of game preserve                            5,000\r\nCaroline Phelps Stokes Bird Fund, N.Y. Zoological Society            5,000\r\nBoone and Crockett Fund for Preservation                             5,000\r\nA Friend in Rochester                                                2,500\r\nHenry C. Frick                                                       1,500\r\nSamuel Thorne                                                        1,250\r\n\r\nOf all the above, the only endowment funds yielding an annual income are\r\nthose of the National Association of Audubon Societies and the Caroline\r\nPhelps Stokes fund of $5,000 in the treasury of the Zoological Society.\r\n\r\nA fund of $25,000 per year for five years has been guaranteed by the\r\nmakers of shot-guns, rifles and ammunition, to the American Game\r\nProtective and Propagation Association. This is like a limited\r\nendowment.\r\n\r\nIn the civilized world there are citizens of many kinds; but all of them\r\ncan be placed in two groups: (1) those with a sense of duty toward\r\nmankind, and who will do their duty as good citizens; and (2) those who\r\nfrom the cradle to the grave meanly and sordidly study their own selfish\r\ninterests, who never do aught save in expectation of a quick return\r\nbenefit, and who recognize no such thing as duty toward mankind at\r\nlarge.\r\n\r\nMen and women of the first class are honored in life, mourned when dead,\r\nand gratefully remembered by posterity. They leave the world better than\r\nthey found it, and their lives have been successful.\r\n\r\nMen and women of the second class are merely so many pieces of animated\r\nfurniture; and when they pass out the world cares no more than when old\r\nchairs are thrown upon the scrap-heap.\r\n\r\nThere are many men so selfish, so ignorant and mean of soul that even\r\nout of well-filled purses they would not give ten dollars to save the\r\nwhole bird fauna of North America from annihilation. To all persons of\r\nthat brand, it is useless to appeal. As soon as you find one, waste no\r\ntime upon him. Get out of his neighborhood as quickly as you can, and\r\nlook for help among real MEN.\r\n\r\nThe wild life of the world cannot be saved by a few persons, even though\r\nthey work their hearts out in the effort. The cause needs two million\r\nmore helpers; and they must be sought in Group No. 1. They are living,\r\nsomewhere; but the great trouble is to find them, _before it is too\r\nlate_.\r\n\r\nThere are times and causes in which the good citizen has no option but\r\nto render service. The most important of such causes are: the relief of\r\nsuffering humanity, the conservation of the resources of nature, and the\r\nprevention of vandalism. If the American Nation had refused aid to\r\nstricken San Francisco, the callous hard-heartedness of it would have\r\nshocked the world. If the German army of 1871 had destroyed the art\r\ntreasures and the libraries of Paris, it would have set the German\r\nnation back ten centuries, into the ranks of the lowest barbarians.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, in America, and in the regions now being scourged by the\r\nfeather trade, a wonderful FAUNA is being destroyed! It took _millions\r\nof years_ to develop that marvelous array of wild life; and when gone\r\n_it never can be replaced_! Yet the Army of Destruction is sweeping it\r\naway as joyously as a hired laborer cuts down a field of corn.\r\n\r\nThat wild life _can_ be saved! If done, it must be done by the men and\r\nwomen of Group No. 1. The means by which it can be saved are: _Money,\r\nlabor_ and _publicity. Every man of_ ordinary means and intelligence can\r\ncontribute either money or labor. The men on the firing line must not be\r\nexpected to furnish their own food and ammunition. The Workers MUST be\r\nprovided with the money that active campaign work imperatively demands!\r\nThose who cannot conveniently or successfully labor should give money\r\nto this cause; but at the same time, every good citizen should keep in\r\ntouch with his lawmaking representatives, and in times of need ask for\r\nvotes for whatever new laws are necessary.\r\n\r\nWith money enough to arouse the American people in certain ways, the\r\nwild life of North America (north of Mexico) can be saved. _Money_ can\r\nsecure labor and publicity, and the People will do the rest. For this\r\ncampaign work I want, _and must have_, a permanent fund of $10,000 per\r\nannum,--cash always ready for every emergency in field work. I greatly\r\nneed, _and must have, immediately_, an endowment Wild-Life Fund of at\r\nleast $100,000, and eventually $250,000. I can no longer \"pass the hat\"\r\neach year. This is needed in addition to the several thousands of\r\ndollars annually being expended by the Zoological Society in this work.\r\nThe Society is already doing its utmost in wild-life protection, just as\r\nit is in several other fields of activity.\r\n\r\nOutside of New York many wealthy men will say, \"Let New York do it!\"\r\nThat often is the way when national campaigning is to be done. In\r\n_national_ wild-life protection work, New York is to-day bearing about\r\nnine-tenths of the burden. It is my belief that in 1912 outside of New\r\nYork City less than $10,000 was raised and expended in wild-life\r\nprotection save by state and national appropriations. We know that in\r\nthe year mentioned New York expended $221,000 in this cause, all from\r\nprivate sources.\r\n\r\nIn a very short time I shall call for the $100,000 that I now must have\r\nas an endowment fund for nation-wide work, to be placed at 5-1/2 per\r\ncent interest for the $5,500 annual income that it will yield. How much\r\nof this will come from outside the State of New York? Some of it, I am\r\nsure, will come from Massachusetts and Pennsylvania; but will any of it\r\ncome from Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago, St. Louis and San Francisco?\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nTHE DUTY OF THE HOUR\r\n\r\n\r\nI have now said my say in behalf of wild life. Surely the path of duty\r\ntoward the remnant of wild life is plain enough. Will those who read\r\nthis book pass along my message that the hour for a revolution has\r\nstruck? Will the millions of men commanded by General Apathy now arouse,\r\nbefore it is too late to act?\r\n\r\nWill the true sportsmen rise up, and do their duty, bravely and\r\nunselfishly?\r\n\r\nWill the people with wealth to give away do their duty toward wild life\r\nand humanity, fairly and generously?\r\n\r\nWill the zoologists awake, leave their tables in their stone palaces of\r\npeace, and come out to the firing-line?\r\n\r\nWill the lawmakers heed the handwriting on the wall, and make laws that\r\nrepresent the full discharge of their duty toward wild life and\r\nhumanity?\r\n\r\nWill the editors beat the alarm-gong, early and late, in season and out\r\nof season, until the people awake?\r\n\r\nOn the answers to these questions hang the fate of the wild creatures of\r\nthe world,--their preservation or their extermination.\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\nAbundance of wild life.\r\nAccuracy, value of, in campaigning.\r\nAcklen, J.H.\r\nActinomycosis.\r\nAdams, Cyrus C., on the lion.\r\nAdirondack State Park.\r\nAdjutant.\r\nAfrica,\r\n  big game of\r\n  game preserves in\r\n  rinderpest in\r\n  \"soon to be shot out\".\r\nAfrican big game disappearing.\r\nAfrican game that needs exemption.\r\nAgriculture, Department of.\r\nAigrette.\r\nAkeley, C.E.\r\nAlabama,\r\n  deer killed in\r\n  laws of.\r\nAlabama Game Commissioner.\r\nAlaska,\r\n  brown bears of\r\n  new laws needed in\r\n  game of\r\n  Sitka National Monument in.\r\nAlaska--Yukon region.\r\n_Albatross_, steamer, seals taken by.\r\nAlbatrosses, Laysan.\r\nAlberta,\r\n  at fault on antelope-shooting\r\n  laws of parks of.\r\nAlden, M.P., Percy.\r\nAlgonquin National Park.\r\nAliens,\r\n  game wardens killed by\r\n  prohibited from owning firearms\r\n  slaughter of song-birds by.\r\nAltai Mountains of western China.\r\nAmerican Bison Society.\r\nAmerican Game Protective and Propagation Association.\r\n\"American Natural History\" on hawks and owls.\r\nAmerican, North, Fish and Game Protective Association.\r\nAmerican private game preserves.\r\nAmsterdam.\r\nAnimallai Hills to-day and in 1877.\r\n\"Animal Life in Africa,\" on status of settlers.\r\nAnimals,\r\n  predatory\r\n  caught by cats\r\n  wild, may become nuisances.\r\nAntelope,\r\n  prong-horned\r\n  attempts to transplant\r\n  in Alberta\r\n  in Montana\r\n  in Nevada\r\n  in Texas\r\n  in Wyoming\r\n  lumpy jaw in\r\n  physical weakness of\r\n  present status of\r\n  preserve in Montana\r\n  wrong to kill.\r\nAnthony bill for migratory birds.\r\nAntelopes, African, for the South.\r\nAphis devouring potato-tops.\r\nApple crop, losses on.\r\nAquarium, West Indian seals in.\r\nAreas inhabited by big game.\r\nArgali, Siberian.\r\nArizona\r\n  new laws needed in\r\n  national monuments in.\r\nArizona elk exterminated.\r\nArkansas\r\n  new laws needed in.\r\nArmy of Defense.\r\nArmy of Destruction.\r\nArmy worm.\r\nArnold, Craig D.\r\nAshe, T.J.\r\nAsia, future of big game of.\r\nAsiatic game that should be close-seasoned.\r\nAskins, Charles, article in _Recreation_ by.\r\nAssociation in Pennsylvania fighting Game Commission.\r\nAssociation, Wool-Growers, fighting antelope preserve.\r\nAstley, Hubert D.\r\nAtkinson, George.\r\n_Atlanta Journal_.\r\nAudubon Societies, National Association of.\r\nAuk, Great.\r\nAustrians in Minnesota.\r\nAustralia,\r\n  animal pests in\r\n  game preserves in.\r\nAutomatic and pump shot-guns\r\n  campaign against, won in New Jersey\r\n  denounced by organizations\r\n  use of, prohibited by law.\r\nAutomobile, use of, in hunting forbidden.\r\nAutomobiles detrimental to wild life.\r\nAvare, Game Warden Henry\r\nAvery, Carlos\r\nAvery Island, La., robin slaughter at\r\n_Avicultural Magazine_\r\nAvocet\r\n\r\n       +       +       +       +       +\r\n\r\nBag insects\r\nBag limit,\r\n  in Africa;\r\n  a delusion,\r\n  Alberta,\r\n  British Columbia,\r\n  Manitoba,\r\n  Saskatchewan\r\nBaird, Spencer F.\r\nBaker, Frank\r\nBancroft, W.F.\r\nBarber, Charles\r\nBarren grounds of the Arctic regions\r\nBaynard, Oscar E.\r\nBayne law\r\n  against sale of game in New York\r\n  bill,\r\n  breeding game under,\r\n  genesis of\r\nBeal, F.E.L.\r\nBear,\r\n  black, in South Carolina\r\n  grizzly, ethics of hunting the,\r\n  almost gone from United States,\r\n  California grizzly\r\nBears,\r\n  Alaskan brown;\r\n  alleged damages by,\r\n  grizzly, bag limit demanded on,\r\n  in Yellowstone Park, estimated,\r\n  killed by Forestry Bureau,\r\n  of Yellowstone Park\r\nBeard, Daniel C.,\r\n  cartoon by\r\n  on bird destruction\r\nBeaver in New Brunswick\r\nBedford, Duke of, David's deer saved by,\r\nBeebe, C.
