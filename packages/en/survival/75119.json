K. GILBERT.\r\n\r\n  Prof. J. W. POWELL,\r\n                  _In charge_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                PREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf these pages fail to give a correct account of the structure of the\r\nHenry Mountains the fault is mine and I have no excuse. In all the\r\nearlier exploration of the Rocky Mountain Region, as well as in much of\r\nthe more recent survey, the geologist has merely accompanied the\r\ngeographer and has had no voice in the determination of either the route\r\nor the rate of travel. When the structure of a mountain was in doubt he\r\nwas rarely able to visit the points which should resolve the doubt, but\r\nwas compelled to turn regretfully away. Not so in the survey of the\r\nHenry Mountains. Geological exploration had shown that they were well\r\ndisposed for examination, and that they promised to give the key to a\r\ntype of structure which was at best obscurely known; and I was sent by\r\nProfessor Powell to make a study of them, without restriction as to my\r\norder or method. I was limited only in time, the snow stopping my work\r\ntwo months after it was begun. Two months would be far too short a\r\nperiod in which to survey a thousand square miles in Pennsylvania or\r\nIllinois, but among the Colorado Plateaus it proved sufficient. A few\r\ncomprehensive views from mountain tops gave the general distribution of\r\nthe formations, and the remainder of the time was spent in the\r\nexamination of the localities which best displayed the peculiar features\r\nof the structure. So thorough was the display and so satisfactory the\r\nexamination, that in preparing my report I have felt less than ever\r\nbefore the desire to revisit the field and prove my conclusions by more\r\nextended observation.\r\n\r\nIn the description of the details of the structure a demand arose for a\r\ngreater number of geographic titles than were readily suggested by\r\nnatural forms or other accidents, and recourse was had to the names of\r\ngeologists. Except that the present members of my own corps are not\r\nincluded, the names chosen are of those whose cognate studies have given\r\nme most aid. Mr. Steward and Mr. Howell saw the Henry Mountains before I\r\ndid, and gleaned something of their structure from a distance; Dr.\r\nNewberry, Mr. Marvine, Dr. Peale, and Mr. Holmes have described allied\r\nphenomena in Colorado and New Mexico; and the works of Messrs. Jukes,\r\nGeikie, Scrope, and Dana have been among my chief sources of information\r\nin regard to igneous mountains in general. If any of these gentlemen\r\nfeel offended that their names have been attached to natural features so\r\ninsignificant, I can assure them that the affront will never be repeated\r\nby the future denizens of the region. The herders who build their hut at\r\nthe base of the Newberry Arch are sure to call it “the Cedar Knoll”; the\r\nJukes Butte will be dubbed “Pilot Knob”, and the Scrope, “Rocky Point”.\r\n\r\nDuring the preparation of my report every part of the discussion has\r\nbeen submitted to Professor Powell for criticism, and many of his\r\nsuggestions are embodied in the text. Similar and valuable aid was\r\nreceived from Capt. C. E. Dutton and Mr. William B. Taylor in the study\r\nof the physical problems to which the discussion of the intrusive\r\nphenomena gave rise. Captain Dutton rendered an important service also\r\nby the study of the collection of igneous rocks, and his report,\r\nincluded in the fourth chapter, testifies to the thoroughness of his\r\nwork. The supervision of the publication has fallen in large share upon\r\nMr. J. C. Pilling, and the text has had the advantage of his literary\r\ncriticism, as well as of his watchful care.\r\n\r\n                                                                G. K.

Previous to\r\n1869 they were not placed upon any map, nor was mention made of them in\r\nany of the published accounts of exploration or survey in the Rocky\r\nMountain region. In that year Professor Powell while descending the\r\nColorado River in boats passed near their foot, and gave to them the\r\nname which they bear in honor of Prof. Joseph Henry, the distinguished\r\nphysicist. In 1872 Prof A. H. Thompson, engaged in the continuance of\r\nthe survey of the river, led a party across the mountains by the\r\nPenellen Pass, and climbed some of the highest peaks. Frontiersmen in\r\nsearch of farming and grazing lands or of the precious metals have since\r\nthat time paid several visits to the mountains; but no survey was made\r\nof them until the years 1875 and 1876, when Mr. Walter H. Graves and the\r\nwriter visited them for that purpose.\r\n\r\nThey are situated in Southern Utah, and are crossed by the meridian of\r\n110° 45′ and the thirty-eighth parallel. They stand upon the right bank\r\nof the Colorado River of the West, and between its tributaries, the\r\nDirty Devil and the Escalante.\r\n\r\nAt the time of their discovery by Professor Powell the mountains were in\r\nthe center of the largest unexplored district in the territory of the\r\nUnited States—a district which by its peculiar ruggedness had turned\r\naside all previous travelers. Up to that time the greater part of the\r\nknowledge that had been gained of the interior of the continent had been\r\nacquired in the search for routes for transcontinental railways; and the\r\ncañons of the Colorado Basin, opposing more serious obstacles to travel\r\nthan the mountain ranges which were met in other latitudes, were by\r\ncommon consent avoided by the engineers.\r\n\r\nThe same general causes which have rendered the region so difficult of\r\naccess and passage have made it a desert, almost without economic value.\r\nThe physical conditions of elevation and aridity which have caused it to\r\nbe so deeply carved in cañons, have prevented the streams with which it\r\nis scantily watered from being bordered by tracts of land which can be\r\nirrigated; and agriculture without irrigation being in that climate an\r\nimpossibility, there is nothing to attract the farmer. As will be\r\nexplained in the sequel, the mountains offer no inducements to the miner\r\nof the precious metals. There is timber upon their flanks and there is\r\ncoal near at hand, but both are too far removed from other economic\r\ninterests to find the market which would give them value. It is only for\r\npurposes of grazing that they can be said to have a money value, and so\r\ndistant are they at present from any market that even that value is\r\nsmall.\r\n\r\nBut while the Henry Mountains contribute almost nothing to our direct\r\nmaterial interests, they offer in common with the plateaus which\r\nsurround them a field of surpassing interest to the student of\r\nstructural geology. The deep carving of the land which renders it so\r\ninhospitable to the traveler and the settler, is to the geologist a\r\ndissection which lays bare the very anatomy of the rocks, and the dry\r\nclimate which makes the region a naked desert, soilless and almost\r\nplantless, perfects the preparation for his examination.\r\n\r\nThe study of the mountains is further facilitated by their isolation.\r\nThey mark a limited system of disturbances, which interrupt a region of\r\ngeological calm, and structurally, as well as topographically, stand by\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Henry Mountains are not a range, and have no trend; they are simply\r\na group of five individual mountains, separated by low passes and\r\narranged without discernible system. The highest rise about 5,000 feet\r\nabove the plateau at their base and 11,000 feet above the level of the\r\nocean. Projecting so far above the surface of the desert, they act as\r\nlocal condensers of moisture, and receive a comparatively generous\r\nsupply of rain. Springs abound upon their flanks, and their upper slopes\r\nare clothed with a luxuriant herbage and with groves of timber. The\r\nsmaller mountains and the foot-hills of the larger are less generously\r\nwatered and but scantily clothed with vegetation. Their extent is small.\r\nFrom Ellen Peak to Mount Ellsworth, the two summits which are the most\r\nwidely separated, the distance is but twenty-eight miles, and a circle\r\nof eighteen miles radius will include the whole group.\r\n\r\nMount Ellen which is the most northerly of the group, has an extreme\r\naltitude of 11,250 feet, and surpasses all its companions in horizontal\r\nextent as well as altitude. Its crest-line is continuous for two miles,\r\nwith an elevation varying little from 11,000 feet. From it there radiate\r\nspurs in all directions, descending to a series of foot-hills as\r\nconspicuous in their topography as they are interesting in their\r\nstructure. In some places the base of the mountain is guarded by a\r\ncontinuous, steep ridge, through which a passage must be sought by the\r\napproaching traveler, but within which movement in any direction is\r\ncomparatively unimpeded.\r\n\r\nMount Pennell is a single peak rising to an altitude of 11,150 feet. On\r\none side its slopes join those of Mount Ellen in Pennellen Pass (7,550\r\nfeet), and on the other those of Mount Hillers in the Dinah Creek Pass\r\n(7,300 feet). Its profiles are simple, and it lacks the salient spurs\r\nthat characterize Mount Ellen. From the west it is difficult of\r\napproach, being guarded by a barrier ridge continuous with that of Mount\r\nEllen.\r\n\r\nMount Hillers is more rugged in its character, and although compact in\r\nits general form, is carved in deep gorges and massive spurs. Its\r\nrugosity is contrasted by the smoothness of its pedestal, which to the\r\nsouth and west and north is a sloping plain merging with the surrounding\r\nplateau.\r\n\r\nMount Ellsworth (8,000 feet) and Mount Holmes (7,750 feet) stand close\r\ntogether, but at a little distance from the others. The pass which\r\nseparates them from Mount Hillers has an altitude of 5,250 feet. They\r\nare single peaks, peculiarly rugged in their forms, and unwatered by\r\nsprings. They stand almost upon the brink of the Colorado, which here\r\nflows through a cañon 1,500 feet in depth.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE ROCK SERIES.\r\n\r\nThe sedimentary rocks which occur in the Henry Mountains and their\r\nimmediate vicinity, range from the summit of the Cretaceous to the\r\nsummit of the Carboniferous. It is probable that they were covered at\r\none time by some thousands of feet of Tertiary strata, but from the\r\nimmediate banks of the Colorado these have been entirely eroded, and\r\ntheir nearest vestiges lie thirty miles to the westward, where they have\r\nbeen protected by the lava-beds of the Aquarius Plateau.\r\n\r\n_Cretaceous._—The Cretaceous strata do not reach to the Colorado River,\r\nbut they extend to the Henry Mountains, and are well displayed upon the\r\nflanks. They include four principal sandstones, with intervening shales,\r\nin the following (descending) order:\r\n\r\n 1. The Ma-suk′ Sandstone, yellow, heavy-bedded                500 feet.\r\n\r\n 2. The Ma-suk′ Shale, gray, argillaceous, and toward the\r\n      top slightly arenaceous                                  500 feet.\r\n\r\n 3. The Blue Gate Sandstone, yellow and heavy-bedded           500 feet.\r\n\r\n 4. The Blue Gate Shale, blue-black and argillaceous,\r\n      weathering to a fine gray clay (_Inoceramus deformis_\r\n      and _I. problematicus_)                                1,000 feet.\r\n\r\n 5. The Tu-nunk′ Sandstone, yellow and heavy-bedded            100 feet.\r\n\r\n 6. The Tu-nunk′ Shale, blue-black and argillaceous,\r\n      weathering to a fine gray clay (_Inoceramus\r\n      problematicus_ and _Baculites anceps_)                   400 feet.\r\n\r\n 7. The Henry’s Fork Group, consisting of—\r\n\r\n    _a._ Friable yellow sandstone with numerous fossils\r\n         (_Ostrea prudentia_, _Gryphea Pitcheri_, _Exogyra\r\n         læviuscula_, _Exogyra ponderosa_, _Plicatula\r\n         hydrotheca_, _Camptonectes platessa_, and _Callista\r\n         Deweyi_)                                               10 feet.\r\n\r\n    _b._ Arenaceous shales, purple, green, and white, with\r\n         local beds of conglomerate                            190 feet.\r\n\r\n    _c._ Coarse sandstone and conglomerate, with many white\r\n         grains and pebbles, interleaved with local beds of\r\n         purple and red shale, and containing immense\r\n         silicified tree-trunks                                300 feet.\r\n\r\n                                                             —————\r\n\r\n                        Total Cretaceous                     3,500 feet.\r\n\r\nThe three upper sandstones, the Masuk, the Blue Gate, and the Tununk,\r\nare so nearly identical in their lithologic characters that I was unable\r\nto discriminate them in localities where their sequence was unknown.\r\nThis was especially the case upon the summits of Mounts Ellen and\r\nPennell where they occur in a somewhat metamorphosed condition. All of\r\nthem contain thin beds of coal, none of which are continuous over large\r\nareas, and only one of which was observed of workable thickness. At the\r\nwestern foot of Mount Ellen, a bed four feet thick lies at the base of\r\nthe Blue Gate Sandstone.\r\n\r\nThere is almost equal difficulty in discriminating the Masuk, the Blue\r\nGate, and the Tununk shales. The first is usually of a paler color and\r\nis more apt to include arenaceous bands. It has not been found to\r\ncontain fossils, while the lower shales rarely fail to afford them when\r\nsearch is made. The Blue Gate and Tununk shales are typical examples of\r\nfine argillaceous sediments. They are beautifully laminated and are\r\nremarkably homogeneous. It is only in fresh escarpments that the\r\nlamination is seen, the weathered surface presenting a structureless\r\nclay. The fossils of these shales are so numerous, when they have been\r\nsought out and studied, that they will probably serve not merely to\r\ndiscriminate the two, but also to correlate them with some of the beds\r\nwhich have been examined elsewhere in the Colorado Basin. For the\r\npresent I am unable to refer any of the Cretaceous rocks above the\r\nHenry’s Fork Group to the divisions which have been recognized\r\nelsewhere, and it is for this reason that I have given local, and\r\nperhaps temporary names to such beds as I have need to mention in the\r\ndiscussion of the structure of the mountains.\r\n\r\nThe fossils of the Henry’s Fork Group have been more fully collected,\r\nand they have been referred without question by Dr. White to the group\r\nof that name, as recognized in the Green River Basin (Geology of the\r\nUinta Mountains, pp. 82 and 94). The white grit which lies at the base\r\nof the group is a conspicuous bed of unusual persistence, and is\r\nrecognized wherever Cretaceous rocks are found in the upper basin of the\r\nColorado.\r\n\r\n_Jura-Trias._—The rocks which intervene between the base of the\r\nCretaceous and the summit of the Carboniferous are of doubtful age,\r\nhaving been referred to the Trias by one geologist and to the Jura and\r\nTrias by others, while the fossils recently discovered by Mr. Howell\r\n(Geology of Uinta Mountains, page 80) lead to the suspicion at least\r\nthat they are all Jurassic. It is probable that the uncertainty will\r\nsoon be dispelled by the more thorough working of Mr. Howell’s new\r\nlocalities; but while it remains, it seems best to recognize its\r\nexistence in our nomenclature, and I shall include the whole of the\r\ndoubtful series under the title of _Jura-Trias_. At the Henry Mountains\r\nit is easily divided into four groups, as follows:\r\n\r\n 1. Flaming Gorge Group; arenaceous shales or bad-land\r\n      sandstones, purple and white at top and red below      1,200 feet.\r\n\r\n 2. Gray Cliff Group; massive cross-laminated sandstone,\r\n      buff to red in color                                     500 feet.\r\n\r\n 3. Vermilion Cliff Group; massive cross-laminated\r\n      sandstone, red, with a purple band at the top            500 feet.\r\n\r\n 4. Shin-ar´-ump Group; consisting of—\r\n\r\n    _a._ Variegated clay shale; purple and white above and\r\n         chocolate below, with silicified wood                 300 feet.\r\n\r\n    _b._ Gray conglomerate, with silicified wood; the\r\n         “Shinarump Conglomerate”                               30 feet.\r\n\r\n    _c._ Chocolate-colored shale, in part sandy                  400 feet.\r\n\r\n                                                             —————\r\n\r\n                         Total Jura-Trias                    2,930 feet.\r\n\r\nThe rock of the Flaming Gorge Group is of a peculiar character. It is\r\nordinarily so soft that in its manner of weathering it appears to be a\r\nshale. It is eroded so much more rapidly than the Henry’s Fork\r\nconglomerate above it, that the latter is undermined, and always appears\r\nin the topography as the cap of a cliff. Nevertheless, it is not\r\nstrictly speaking a shale. The chief product of its weathering is sand,\r\nand wherever it can be examined in an unweathered condition it is found\r\nto be a fine-grained sandstone, massive and cross-laminated like those\r\nof the Gray and Vermilion Cliffs, but devoid of a firm cement. In a\r\nnumber of localities it has acquired, locally and accidentally, a\r\ncement, and it is there hardly distinguishable from the firmer\r\nsandstones which underlie it. In the immediate vicinity of the Henry\r\nMountains it varies little except in color from summit to base, but in\r\nother localities not far distant it is interrupted near the base by\r\nthick beds of gypsum and gypsiferous clays, and by a sectile,\r\nfossiliferous limestone.\r\n\r\nThe Gray Cliff and Vermilion Cliff sandstones are often difficult to\r\ndistinguish, but the latter is usually the firmer, standing in bold\r\nrelief in the topography, with level top, and at its edge a precipitous\r\nface. The former is apt to weather into a wilderness of dome-like\r\npinnacles, so steepsided that they cannot often be scaled by the\r\nexperienced mountaineer, and separated by narrow clefts which are\r\nequally impassable.\r\n\r\nThe colors of the two sandstones are not invariable. The lower, which\r\nalthough not reddened throughout its mass is usually stained upon its\r\nsurface with a uniform deep color, appears in Mount Ellsworth and at\r\nother points of elevation with as pale a tint as that of the Gray Cliff.\r\nThe latter sandstone, on the other hand, where it lies low, is often as\r\ndeep in color as the Vermilion. Standing upon one of the summits of the\r\nHenry Mountains and looking eastward, I found myself unable to\r\ndistinguish the Gray Cliff Sandstone by color either from the lower part\r\nof the Flaming Gorge Group or from the Vermilion Sandstone. The\r\nbleaching of the redder sandstone in Mount Ellsworth is probably a\r\nresult of metamorphism; the reddening of the gray sandstone may depend\r\non the hydration of the iron which it contains.\r\n\r\nThe thickness of individual strata in these great sandstones is\r\nremarkable, and is one of the elements which must be taken into account\r\nin the discussion of the problem—which to my mind is yet unsolved—of the\r\nmanner in which such immense quantities of homogeneous sand were\r\naccumulated. Ordinarily the depth of strata is indefinable, on account\r\nof the impossibility of distinguishing stratification from lamination;\r\nbut where, as in this case, the lamination is oblique to the\r\nstratification, the upper and lower limits of each stratum are\r\ndefinitely marked. I have at several points measured single strata with\r\nthicknesses of about fifty feet, and near Waterpocket Cañon a stratum of\r\nVermilion Cliff sandstone was found to be 105 feet thick.\r\n\r\nOne other measurement is worthy of record; the inclination which oblique\r\nlamination bears to the plane of the stratum in which it occurs appears\r\nto have a definite limit. The maximum of a series of measurements made\r\nat points where to the eye the dip seemed to be unusually great, is 24°.\r\n\r\nThe sandy layers at the base of the Shinarump Group are characterized by\r\nprofuse ripple-marks.\r\n\r\n_Carboniferous._—Beneath the Jura-Trias is the Carboniferous. A few\r\nhundred feet of its upper member, the Aubrey Sandstone, are exposed near\r\nthe summit of Mount Ellsworth. At that point the sandstone is altered to\r\nthe condition of a quartzite, but where it is cut by the upper and lower\r\ncañons of the Dirty Devil River it is massive and cross-laminated,\r\ndiffering from the Gray Cliff sandstone chiefly in the abundance of its\r\ncalcareous cement.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            UNCONFORMITIES.\r\n\r\nFrom the Masuk Sandstone to the Aubrey Sandstone, inclusive, there is\r\nperfect conformity of dip. The fold system of the region, of which a\r\ndescription will be found in succeeding pages, was established after the\r\ndeposition of all these strata, and the whole series were flexed\r\ntogether. Nevertheless, the strata do not represent continuous\r\ndeposition. There were intervals in which the sea receded and exposed to\r\nerosion the sediments which it had accumulated. Shallow valleys and\r\nwaterways were excavated, and when the sea returned it deposited new\r\nsediments upon the somewhat uneven surface of the old.\r\n\r\nThe first occurrence of this sort was at the close of the Aubrey epoch.\r\nIts evidence was not found in the Henry Mountains; but at the confluence\r\nof the Paria with the Colorado, eighty miles to the southeast, the\r\nsurface of the upper member of the Aubrey Group, which is there a cherty\r\nlimestone, is unevenly worn, and in its depressions are beds of\r\nconglomerate, the pebbles of which are derived from the chert of the\r\nlimestone itself. The shaly, rippled sandstones which succeed this\r\nconglomerate indicate that the water remained shallow for a time, and in\r\nthe middle of the Shinarump epoch the region was once more abandoned by\r\nthe sea. The chocolate shales and shaly sands were unevenly worn, and\r\nthe first deposit that the returning sea spread over them was a\r\nconglomerate. The evidence of this break is found at many points. The\r\nShinarump conglomerate although remarkably persistent for a conglomerate\r\nthins out and disappears at a number of points, and at the margins of\r\nits areas it is evident to the eye that it occupies depressions of the\r\nsurface on which it rests.\r\n\r\nThe next break is at the base of the Vermilion Cliff Group. In the\r\nregion of the Virgin River and Kanab Creek the change from the\r\nvariegated shales of the Upper Shinarump to the homogeneous sandstone of\r\nthe Vermilion Cliff is gradual, the interval being filled by a series of\r\nalternating shales and sandstones; but further to the east, in the\r\nregion of the Henry Mountains and Waterpocket Cañon, the change is\r\nabrupt, and the firm sandstone rests directly upon the soft shale. The\r\nabruptness of the change would suggest that the currents which brought\r\nthe sand had swept away all evidence of the intermediate conditions\r\nwhich are likely to have connected the epochs represented by the two\r\nsediments; but in one locality, at least, there is direct evidence that\r\nthe surface of the clay was exposed to the air before it was covered by\r\nthe sand. On the northern flank of Mount Ellsworth are the vestiges of a\r\nsystem of mud-cracks, such as form where wet clays are dried in the sun.\r\nWhere the under surface of the Vermilion sandstone is exposed to view,\r\nit is seen to be marked by a network of ridges which once occupied the\r\nsun-cracks of the Shinarump clay; and where the clay is seen in\r\njuxtaposition, tapering fillets of sand can be traced from the ridges\r\ndownward ten feet into the clay.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 1.—Fossil Suncracks in the Shinarump Shale.\r\n]\r\n\r\nFrom the base of the Vermilion to the summit of the Cretaceous no\r\nevidence of land erosion has been found; but the association of coal\r\nseams with all of the Cretaceous sandstones except the lowest, shows\r\nthat the sea-bottom was frequently brought to the surface of the water\r\nif it was not carried above.\r\n\r\nThus it is evident that the strata of the Henry Mountain region do not\r\nrepresent continuous sedimentation. At the close of the Aubrey epoch, in\r\nthe middle of the Shinarump, and again at the close of the Shinarump,\r\nnot merely was the accumulation of sediments interrupted, but the\r\nprocess was reversed, and a portion of the deposits which had already\r\nbeen formed were excavated by the agency of rains and rivers, and swept\r\naway to some other region. Each break is indefinite, alike as regards\r\nthe interval during which the record of the sea was interrupted and as\r\nregards the extent of the record which was at the same time obliterated.\r\nAnd yet the evidence of these breaks is of such nature that it would\r\nprobably elude observation if a single section only were examined, and\r\nin a region masked by the soil and vegetation of a humid climate it\r\nwould hardly be discovered except by accident. The parallelism of\r\ncontiguous strata is not alone sufficient evidence that they were\r\nconsecutive in time.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the close of the Cretaceous period there came an epoch of\r\ndisturbance. The system of strata which has been described was bent into\r\ngreat waves, and the crests of the waves were lifted so high above the\r\nsea that they lost thousands of feet by erosion.\r\n\r\nIn the troughs between the waves lakes remained, in which the material\r\nremoved from the crests was redeposited, and by a later change the lake\r\nwaters rose so as to cover the truncated crests, and deposit upon the\r\nworn edges of the upbent strata a series of unconforming, fresh-water,\r\nTertiary sediments.\r\n\r\nThus was produced the only _unconformity of dip_ which involves the\r\nHenry Mountain rocks, and even this is not to be observed in the\r\nimmediate vicinity of the mountains, for a later erosion has thence\r\nremoved all of the Tertiary strata, and has resumed the degradation of\r\nthe older beds.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE GREAT FOLDS.\r\n\r\nThe disturbances at the close of the Cretaceous period were of the\r\nKaibab type[1]. It seems as though the crust of the earth had been\r\ndivided into great blocks, each many miles in extent, which were moved\r\nfrom their original positions in various ways. Some were carried up and\r\nothers down, and the majority were left higher at one margin than at the\r\nother. But although they moved independently, they were not cleft\r\nasunder. The strata remained continuous, and were flexed instead of\r\nfaulted at the margins of the blocks. Subsequent erosion has obliterated\r\nin great part the inequality of the surface, and the higher-lying blocks\r\ndo not stand as mountains, but are outlined by zones of tilted strata\r\nwhich mark the flexures by which the blocks are separated. Along the\r\nzones of flexure it frequently happens that a hard stratum outcropping\r\nbetween two that are softer will be preserved from erosion and form a\r\nlong, continuous ridge. Such ridges, and other forms produced by the\r\nerosion of the flexures, are conspicuous features of the topography, and\r\nthe tracing out of the limits of the blocks is a simple matter. Indeed\r\nthe flexures are the first elements of the structure to attract\r\nattention, and it is easy in studying them to overlook the fact that\r\nthey merely mark the limits between displaced masses of great extent. If\r\nthe reader will examine Plate I at the end of the volume, he will\r\nobserve that the system of parallel ridges and valleys which follow the\r\nline of the Waterpocket flexure are very conspicuous features; but it is\r\nonly by some such generalization as that given in the stereogram of the\r\nsame region (Plate II) that the full structural significance of the\r\nflexures can be realized. Each map was obtained by photography from a\r\nmodel in relief, in which the proportionate heights of the several\r\nfeatures were not exaggerated. The stereogram was produced by the\r\nrestoration of the top of the Cretaceous, the Masuk sandstone, in the\r\nform and position it would have, had there been no erosion of the\r\nregion, but displacement only.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1:\r\n\r\n  For a definition of the Kaibab structure, see “Geology of the Uinta\r\n  Mountains,” pp. 14 and 17, and American Journal of Science for July\r\n  and August, 1876, pp. 21 and 85.\r\n\r\nI must caution the reader against an implication of rigidity which might\r\nattach to the meaning of the word “block”, as I have used it in speaking\r\nof the great displaced rock masses. To what extent they may be regarded\r\nas rigid is uncertain, but the presence upon their surfaces of numerous\r\nminor flexures, such as appear in the stereogram, would seem to imply\r\nthat their rigidity is not of a high order.\r\n\r\nIn the northwest corner of the area represented by the stereogram are a\r\nfew faults belonging to a system which occupies a large area in that\r\ndirection. The system of faults and the system of flexures are\r\nindependent, the latter having originated at the close of the Cretaceous\r\nperiod, and the former after the formation of the Tertiary rocks of the\r\nregion, which are referred by Professor Powell to the Bitter Creek\r\nepoch. Over a large district the Tertiary strata were covered by a deep\r\nmantle of lava, which has protected them from erosion to such an extent\r\nthat the structure of the district is portrayed in its topography. The\r\ndistrict is its own stereogram, each uplifted block constituting a\r\nmountain and each depressed block flooring a valley.\r\n\r\nNot all the displacements of the later system are by faulting, but by\r\nfar the greater number. Of the earlier system of displacements none are\r\nsimple faults, but a few are combinations of fault and flexure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 2.—Cross-section of the Waterpocket Flexure, opposite the Masuk\r\n    Plateau.

It is far from following a straight line, but like most lines of\r\norographic disturbance swerves to the right and left, while maintaining\r\na general trend. The amount of its “throw”, or the difference in level\r\nbetween adjacent parts of the two blocks which it divides, is\r\ninconstant, its maximum being 7,000 feet. At some points the flexed\r\nstrata are inclined at an angle of 50° while at others their greatest\r\ndip is but 15°. Toward the north the flexure twice divides. One of its\r\nbranches, the Blue Gate flexure, has a throw in the same direction, and\r\nby its separation diminishes the throw of the main flexure. The other,\r\nthe Red Gate flexure, has a throw in the opposite direction, and by its\r\nseparation increases the throw of the main flexure. Or in other words,\r\nthe blocks at the west of the main flexure stand higher than those at\r\nthe east; and of two blocks which lie at the west, that at the north of\r\nthe Red Gate flexure stands higher than that at the south; while of two\r\nblocks at the east, that which lies northwest of the Blue Gate flexure\r\nis higher than the one at the southeast.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          CLIFFS AND PLATEAUS.\r\n\r\nLet us now return to the topographic map (Plate I) and examine the forms\r\ninto which erosion has wrought the disturbed strata. Thanks to the\r\naridity of the climate, the erosion has been greatly influenced by the\r\nvarying texture of the rocks. Every hard stratum, if inclined, stands\r\nforth in a ridge, or if level, caps a plateau. The Masuk Sandstone,\r\nundermined by the weathering of the Masuk Shale, breaks off everywhere\r\nin a cliff which completely encircles the Masuk Plateau. The plateau\r\nstands upon the Blue Gate Sandstone, and this breaking off in a cliff\r\nupon all sides constitutes another plateau. The Blue Gate Plateau, in\r\nturn, rests upon the Tununk, and that again upon the Henry’s Fork.\r\nPassing either to the north or to the south from the Masuk Plateau, one\r\ndescends a great geological stairway, of which each step is a hard\r\nsandstone and each riser a soft shale. Toward the Waterpocket flexure\r\nthe edge of each plateau is upturned, and if one goes westward from the\r\nMasuk Plateau, he will cross in the first mile the upturned rocks of all\r\nthe lower tables.\r\n\r\nThe preservation of the Masuk Plateau is due in part to the fact that it\r\nlies in a slight synclinal, but chiefly to the arrangement of the\r\ndrainage lines. No streams cross the Henry Mountains, but all go around,\r\nand the plateau occupies the divide between those which flow southward\r\nto the Colorado and those which flow northward to the Dirty Devil.\r\n\r\nThe antithesis of the Masuk Plateau is to be seen in the Circle Cliffs,\r\non the summit of the Waterpocket fold. At the lowest point of the Masuk\r\nsynclinal a circling cliff has been formed, which facing outward\r\nsurrounds a plateau. At the highest point of the Waterpocket fold, which\r\nis in a certain sense anticlinal, a circling cliff has been formed\r\nwhich, facing inward, surrounds a valley. The two phenomena are alike\r\nillustrations of the law that in regions of inclined strata cliffs face\r\ntoward districts of elevation and away from districts of depression.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   HOW TO REACH THE HENRY MOUNTAINS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 5.—Ways and Means.\r\n]\r\n\r\nNo one but a geologist will ever profitably seek out the Henry\r\nMountains, and I will therefore, in marking out a route by which they\r\nmay be reached, select whenever there is option those paths which will\r\ngive him the best introduction to this wonderful land. There is no\r\nwagon-road to the mountains, and although a wagon might carry his\r\nbaggage the greater part of the way, he must provide himself with other\r\nmeans of transportation. At Salt Lake City he can procure pack-mules and\r\npack-saddles, or _apparajos_, and everything necessary for a mountain\r\n“outfit”. His route southward follows the line of the Utah Southern\r\nRailway to Juab Valley, and then touches the Mormon towns of Nephi,\r\nGunnison, and Salina. At Salina he halts his train for a day while he\r\nrides a few miles up the creek to see the unconformity between the\r\nTertiary above, and the Jura-Trias and Cretaceous below. This is at\r\npresent the last settlement on the route, but there are “ranches” as far\r\nas Rabbit Valley, and if he delays a few years he will find a town\r\nthere. By way of the “Twist” road and King’s Meadows he goes to Grass\r\nValley, and thence to Fish Lake. The lake lies between two upheaved\r\nblocks of trachyte, and covers one which is relatively depressed, and\r\ntilted to the north. At the south end of the lake he stands on the\r\nhigher end of the depressed block, and if he follows the shore to the\r\noutlet at the north he will find that the water is contained by a\r\nmoraine, which has been thrown across the valley by an ancient glacier,\r\ndescending from the mountain at the west. From Fish Lake he goes to\r\nRabbit Valley, and there delays a day or two to climb Thousand Lake\r\nMountain. Looking west from the summit he sees the lava-capped plateaus\r\nof the faulted district among which he has journeyed since he left the\r\n“Twist”—huge tables of trachyte bounded by cliffs of displacement, of\r\nwhich only the sharpest edges have been worn away; and when his eye has\r\nbecome accustomed to the _facies_ of the faults, he perceives that there\r\nis an identity in structure between the great and the small features.\r\nJust as the whole district is divided into blocks, of which the\r\ndimensions are measured by miles, and the displacements by thousands of\r\nfeet, so the greater blocks are sometimes divided into smaller, of which\r\nthe dimensions are measured by rods and furlongs and the displacements\r\nby tens and hundreds of feet. Looking eastward he sees the region of the\r\ngreat flexures spread out before him like a map. The Waterpocket flexure\r\nstarts from the very mountain beneath him, and curving to the right,\r\nruns far to the south and is lost in the distance. Beyond it are the\r\nHenry Mountains springing abruptly from the desert; and against the\r\nhorizon are outlined other island mountains, gray in the distance. To\r\nthe left is the San Rafael Fold, the rival of the Waterpocket in\r\ngrandeur; and all about are tables and cliffs. The vivid hues of the\r\nnaked rocks are obscured only by the desert haze, and the whole\r\nstructure is pictured forth by form and color.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 6.—The Unconformity of the lower cañon of Salina Creek. The\r\n    horizontal strata are Tertiary; the inclined, Cretaceous.\r\n]\r\n\r\nTo reach the Henry Mountains from Rabbit Valley, he must cross the\r\nWaterpocket flexure; and so continuous and steep are the monoclinal\r\nridges which follow the line of flexure, that there are but four points\r\nknown where he can effect a passage. Except at these points, the barrier\r\nis impassable from Thousand Lake Mountain to the Colorado River, a\r\ndistance of eighty miles. The most difficult and circuitous route I will\r\nnot describe. The remaining three diverge but slightly from each other.\r\nStarting from Rabbit Valley he follows for a few miles the valley of the\r\nDirty Devil, which here, through the “Red Gate”, passes from the\r\ntrachyte plateaus and enters the land of cañons. He does not follow it\r\nfar, but where the river enters a cañon in the Aubrey Sandstone, bears\r\nto the left, and by the aid of a trail which Indians have made finds a\r\nsinuous but easy pathway along a monoclinal valley, following the\r\noutcrop of the lower Shinarump. At his right the Aubrey Sandstone rises\r\nto form the plateau through which the river defiles. At his left the\r\nVermilion Sandstone stands in a vertical wall. Beneath his feet are the\r\nshaly sandstones of the Shinarump Group, bare of vegetation and\r\ndisplaying a profusion of ripple-marks, such as is rarely if ever\r\nequaled. A ride of twelve miles brings him once more to the Dirty Devil\r\nRiver, which emerging from its Carboniferous cañon dives at once into a\r\nstill deeper cañon through the Vermilion and Gray Cliff Sandstones. He\r\ncan follow the river if he tries, and emerge with it beyond the flexure;\r\nbut the way is difficult and the Indian trail he has followed thus far\r\nleads on to another cañon. The monoclinal valley which has opened so\r\neasy a way continues for fifteen miles farther, and in that distance is\r\ncrossed by four waterways, each of which leads by a narrow cañon through\r\nthe great sandstones. The first and fourth are impassable. The second\r\ncarries no permanent stream, and is called the “Capitol Cañon”. The\r\nthird affords passage to Temple Creek. The smoothest road lies through\r\nCapitol Cañon, but the Temple Creek Cañon has an advantage in the\r\npresence of water, and is furthermore attractive by reason of the\r\npicture-writings on the walls.\r\n\r\nHe has now to cross the Blue Gate flexure, and to do this he leaves\r\nTemple Creek a little below the mouth of its cañon. Seeking once more\r\nthe guidance of a trail, he journeys southeastward over the gypsum and\r\nsand of the Flaming Gorge Group to a pass which from a distance he has\r\ndetected in the monoclinal ridge marking the Henry’s Fork conglomerate.\r\nThrough this pass Tantalus Creek sometimes runs on its way to join the\r\nDirty Devil, and he may find a stream of muddy water; but the bottom is\r\nmore likely to be dry with the exception of a few pools. Passing through\r\nthe gap he finds before him a similar opening in the Tununk Ridge, and\r\nbeyond that a break in the Blue Gate Cliff. From Tantalus Creek he\r\nascends to the pass in the Blue Gate Cliff, and climbing to the summit\r\nof a sharp divide in the shales descends again to Lewis Creek, which\r\nthere follows a cañon through the Blue Gate Plateau. Here he finds\r\nbowlders of the Henry Mountain trachyte—for Lewis Creek rises in the\r\nHenry Mountains—and a few hours’ ride toward the sources of the stream\r\nbrings him to the base of Mount Ellen.\r\n\r\n                             _Distances._\r\n      From Salt Lake City to Salina                    155 miles.\r\n      From Salina to Fish Lake                          38 miles.\r\n      From Fish Lake to Rabbit Valley                   27 miles.\r\n      From Rabbit Valley to Temple Creek Cañon          27 miles.\r\n      From Temple Creek Cañon to Lewis Creek            18 miles.\r\n      Thence to the base of Mount Ellen                 10 miles.\r\n                                                       ———\r\n      Total from Salt Lake City to the Henry Mountains 275 miles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n                 THE STRUCTURE OF THE HENRY MOUNTAINS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mountains stand within the province of the great flexures, but are\r\nindependent of them. Fifteen miles to the westward runs the Waterpocket\r\nflexure. Thirty miles to the north is the San Rafael fold. At the east\r\nthe strata rise toward a great uplift, of which the full form is\r\nunknown. But where the Henry Mountains stand the rocks are unaffected by\r\nthese disturbances. They have a uniform dip of about 45′ to the\r\nnorthwest, and form a perfect datum-plane from which to measure the\r\nmagnitude of the displacements which have given rise to the mountains.\r\n\r\nThe mountains are composed of a large number of parts which are in a\r\ncertain degree individual and homologous. By the generalization of the\r\ncharacters of those parts a conception has been obtained of a _type\r\nstructure_ to which the entire series of phenomena has been referred.\r\n\r\nIn laying the material before the reader, the following plan will be\r\nfollowed:\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst. The type of structure will be briefly set forth.\r\n\r\nSecond. The phenomena by which the type is at once demonstrated and\r\nillustrated will be described in detail.\r\n\r\nThird. The type of structure will be discussed.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the structure of the mountains be as novel to the reader as it was to\r\nthe writer, and if it be as strongly opposed to his preconception of the\r\nmanner in which igneous mountains are constituted, he may well question\r\nthe conclusions in regard to it while they are unsustained by proof. I\r\ncan only beg him to suspend his judgment until the whole case shall have\r\nbeen presented. On some accounts it would have been well to follow in\r\nwriting the order of investigation, and develop the general plan of\r\nstructure as it was developed in the field, by the addition here of one\r\nelement and there of another; or at least to assemble the facts before\r\nannouncing my deductions. But such a course would be at the expense of\r\nan important element of convenience and brevity. As will appear in the\r\nsequel, the preliminary explanation of the type structure furnishes a\r\ncomplement of categories and terms by the aid of which the description\r\nof the details of observation, essentially tedious, is greatly\r\nabbreviated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 7.—Ideal Cross-section of a Mountain of Eruption.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 8.—Ideal Cross-section of a Laccolite, showing the typical form\r\n    and the arching of the overlying strata.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt is usual for igneous rocks to ascend to the surface of the earth, and\r\nthere issue forth and build up mountains or hills by successive\r\neruptions. The molten matter starting from some region of unknown depth\r\npasses through all superincumbent rock-beds, and piles itself up on the\r\nuppermost bed. The lava of the Henry Mountains behaved differently.\r\nInstead of rising through all the beds of the earth’s crust, it stopped\r\nat a lower horizon, insinuated itself between two strata, and opened for\r\nitself a chamber by lifting all the superior beds. In this chamber it\r\ncongealed, forming a massive body of trap. For this body the name\r\n_laccolite_ (λάκκος, _cistern_, and λίθος, _stone_) will be used. Figure\r\n7 and Figure 8 are ideal sections of a mountain of eruption and of a\r\nlaccolite.\r\n\r\nThe laccolite is the chief element of the type of structure exemplified\r\nin the Henry Mountains.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the intrusion of a laccolite will produce upon the\r\nsurface as great a hill as the extrusion of the same quantity of matter,\r\nthe mass which is carried above the original surface being precisely\r\nequivalent to that which is displaced by the laccolite; and it is\r\nfurther evident that where the superior rock is horizontally stratified\r\nevery stratum above the laccolite will be uplifted, and, unless it is\r\nfractured, will be upbent, and will portray, more or less faithfully, by\r\nits curvature, the form of the body it covers.\r\n\r\nAssociated with the laccolites of the Henry Mountains are _sheets_ and\r\n_dikes_.\r\n\r\nThe term _sheet_ will be applied in this report to broad, thin,\r\nstratified bodies of trap, which have been intruded along the partings\r\nbetween sedimentary strata, and conform with the inclosing strata in\r\ndip. _Dikes_ differ from sheets in that they intersect the sedimentary\r\nstrata at greater or less angles, occupying fissures produced by the\r\nrupture of the strata.\r\n\r\nThe logical distinction between dike and sheet is complete, but in\r\nnature it not unfrequently happens that the same body of trap is a sheet\r\nin one place and a dike in another. Between the sheet and the laccolite\r\nthere is a complete gradation. The laccolite is a greatly thickened\r\nsheet, and the sheet is a broad, thin, attenuated laccolite.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 9.—Ideal Cross-section of a Laccolite, with accompanying Sheets\r\n    and Dikes.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn the district under consideration the laccolite is usually, perhaps\r\nalways, accompanied by dikes and sheets (see Figure 9). There are sheets\r\nbeneath laccolites and sheets above them. The superior sheets have never\r\nbeen observed to extend beyond the curved portion of the superior\r\nstrata. Dikes rise from the upper surfaces of the laccolites. They are\r\nlargest and most numerous about the center, but, like the superior\r\nsheets, they often extend nearly to the limit of the flexure of the\r\nuplifted strata. The larger often radiate from the center outward, but\r\nthere is no constancy of arrangement. Where they are numerous they\r\nreticulate.\r\n\r\nIn the accompanying diagrams dikes are represented beneath as well as\r\nabove the laccolites. These are purely hypothetical, since they have not\r\nbeen seen. In a general way, the molten rock must have come from below,\r\nbut the channel by which it rose has in no instance been determined by\r\nobservation.\r\n\r\nThe horizontal distribution of the laccolites is as irregular as the\r\narrangement of volcanic vents. They lie in clusters, and each cluster is\r\nmarked by a mountain. In Mount Ellen there are perhaps thirty\r\nlaccolites. In Mount Holmes there are two; and in Mount Ellsworth one.\r\nMount Pennell and Mount Hillers each have one large and several smaller\r\nones.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 10.—Ideal Cross-section of Grouped Laccolites.\r\n]\r\n\r\nTheir vertical distribution likewise is irregular. Some have intruded\r\nthemselves between Cretaceous strata, others between Jura-Triassic, and\r\nothers between Carboniferous. From the highest to the lowest the range\r\nis not less than 4,000 feet. Those which are above not unfrequently\r\noverlap those which lie below, as represented in the ideal section,\r\nFigure 10.\r\n\r\nThe erosion of the mountains has given the utmost variety of exposure to\r\nthe laccolites. In one place are seen only arching strata; in another,\r\narching strata crossed by a few dikes; in another, arching strata filled\r\nwith a network of dikes and sheets. Elsewhere a portion of the laccolite\r\nitself is bared, or one side is removed so as to exhibit a natural\r\nsection. Here the sedimentary cover has all been removed, and the\r\nlaccolite stands free, with its original form; there the hard trachyte\r\nitself has been attacked by the elements and its form is changed.\r\nSomewhere, perhaps, the laccolite has been destroyed and only a dike\r\nremains to mark the fissure through which it was injected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III.\r\n                 DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE MOUNTAINS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            MOUNT ELLSWORTH.\r\n\r\nIt has already been stated that the strata about the bases of the Henry\r\nMountains are nearly level; but the country which is built of them is\r\nfar from level. The arrangement of the drainage lines has caused the\r\ndegradation of some parts to greatly exceed that of others, so that\r\nwhile the district at the south, which borders the Colorado River, is\r\npaved with the red sandstones of the Jura-Trias series, the adjacent\r\nregion at the north still carries the yellow sandstones and blue shales\r\nof the Cretaceous series. All about Mount Ellsworth are the upper strata\r\nof the Jura-Trias. The lower beds of the same series rise upon its\r\nflanks and arch over its summit.\r\n\r\nA description of the structure of the mountain must include, first, the\r\narch of the strata; second, the faults which modify the arch; third, the\r\nsystem of trachyte dikes and trachyte sheets; and fourth, the sculpture\r\nof the mountain. In its general proportions the arch is at once simple\r\nand symmetrical. From all sides the strata rise, slowly at first, but\r\nwith steadily increasing rate, until the angle of 45° is reached. Then\r\nthe dip as steadily diminishes to the center, where it is nothing. A\r\nmodel to exhibit the form of the dome would resemble a round-topped hat;\r\nonly the level rim would join the side by a curve instead of an angle,\r\nand the sides would not be perpendicular, but would flare rapidly\r\noutward (see Figure 11). The base of the arch is not circular, but is\r\nslightly oval, the long diameter being one-third greater than the short.\r\nThe length of the uplift is a little more than four miles; the width a\r\nlittle more than three miles, and the height about 5,000 feet. The\r\ncurvature fades away so gradually at its outer limit that it is not easy\r\nto tell where it ends, and the horizontal dimensions assigned to the\r\ndome are no more than rude approximations. But there is another element\r\nwhich can be given more exactly. The line of maximum dip, which\r\nseparates the convex upper portion of the dome from the concave\r\nperiphery, is easily traced out in nature, and runs at the foot of the\r\nsteep part of the mountain. It surrounds an area two miles in width and\r\ntwo and two-thirds miles in length.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 11A.—View from the west spur of Mount Ellsworth, showing the\r\n    trachyte dikes of the north spur and revetments of sandstone and\r\n    trachyte.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 11.—Stereogram of Mount Ellsworth; an ideal restoration of the\r\n    form of the overarching strata.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe Ellsworth arch is almost but not completely isolated. The Holmes\r\narch, upon the east side, stands so near that the bases of the two\r\nimpinge and coalesce, and the same thing happens, though less notably,\r\nwith the Hillers arch at the north.\r\n\r\nThe simplicity of the arch is further impaired by faults—not great\r\nfaults dividing the whole uplift, but a system of small displacements\r\nwhich are themselves subordinate phenomena of the uplift. They are\r\nrestricted to the central portion, and never occur so low down as the\r\nline of maximum dip. The strata of the upper part of the arch are\r\ndivided into a number of prismoid blocks which stand at slightly\r\ndifferent levels but are not sufficiently deranged to destroy the\r\ngeneral form of the arch. The greatest throw is only a few hundred feet.\r\nAll or nearly all of the fault planes are occupied by dikes of trachyte.\r\n\r\nThe trachyte injections are not confined to the fault planes, nor is\r\ntheir area so restricted as the fault area. Dikes and sheets abound from\r\nthe crest of the dome down to what might be called its springing\r\nline—the line of maximum dip. At the center, dikes are more numerous;\r\nnear the limit, sheets. The central area is crowded so full of dikes,\r\nand the weathering brings them so conspicuously to the surface, that the\r\nsofter sedimentaries are half concealed, and from some points of view\r\nthe trachyte appears to make the entire mass. The accompanying plan\r\n(Figure 12) shows the arrangement of the dikes in one of the outer\r\namphitheaters of the mountain, where they are less complicated than in\r\nthe central region. The trends of two spurs (_a b_ and _c d_) are\r\nindicated by the hatchings. They join the main crest of the mountain at\r\n_e_, and inclose between them a deep amphitheater which opens to the\r\nwest. Upon the steep walls of the amphitheater the dikes outcrop in\r\nlines of crags, dividing rough slopes of yellow and purple and brown\r\nsandstone. The profile of one of the walls of the amphitheater (from _a_\r\nto _b_, Figure 12) is drawn in Figure 13 for the sake of exhibiting the\r\nrelation of the dikes to faulted blocks of sandstone. It will be seen\r\nthat the throw of the faults is not constantly in one direction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 14.—Profile of the Northern Spur of Mount Ellsworth. 1, 2, 3, 4,\r\n    and 5 are Trachyte Dikes. _A_, Aubrey Sandstone. _S_, Shinarump\r\n    Shale. _V_, Vermilion Cliff Sandstone. _G_, Gray Cliff Sandstone.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe zone of sheets is just inside the line of maximum dip. Usually only\r\none or two sheets are laid bare by the erosion, but at one point (see\r\nFigure 14) four can be counted. Toward the center of the uplift all of\r\nthese are limited by the erosion and exhibit their broken edges.\r\nDownward, or toward the periphery, they dip out of sight. Laterally they\r\ncan be traced along the mountain side for varying distances, but they\r\nsoon wedge out and are replaced by others _en echelon_. In thickness the\r\nsheets rarely exceed 50 feet, and never 100. They are always thin as\r\ncompared to the rock masses which separate them, but, by reason of their\r\nsuperior ability to resist erosion, monopolize a large share of the\r\nsurface, and mask a still greater amount with their _débris_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 12.—Ground plan of Trachyte Dikes on the western flank of Mount\r\n    Ellsworth.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 13.—Profile of a western spur of Mount Ellsworth, showing the\r\n    arrangement of Dikes and Faults. The dotted bed is the purple band\r\n    at the top of the Vermilion Cliff Sandstone. The dikes of trachyte\r\n    are indicated by letters.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe sedimentary rocks are not altered beyond the region of trachyte\r\nintrusion. The mere flexure of the strata was not accompanied by a\r\nperceptible change of constitution. In the zone of sheets there is\r\nlittle change except along the surfaces of the contact. For a few feet,\r\nor perhaps only a few inches, there is a discoloration (usually a\r\ndecolorization) and a slight induration, without notable alteration of\r\nminerals. But in the region of reticulated dikes none of the\r\nsedimentaries are unchanged; crystals are developed, colors are\r\nmodified, and hardness is increased, so that the physical properties of\r\nfamiliar strata no longer serve for their identification. Still there is\r\nno crumpling.\r\n\r\nThe trachyte masses and the altered rocks in contact with them are so\r\nmuch more durable than the unaltered strata about them that they have\r\nbeen left by the erosion in protuberances. The outcrop of every dike and\r\nsheet is a crag or a ridge, and the mountain itself survives the general\r\ndegradation of the country only in virtue of its firmer rock masses.\r\nNevertheless, the mountain, because it was higher than its surroundings,\r\nhas been exposed to more rapid erosion, and has been deprived of a\r\ngreater depth of strata. From the base of the arch there have been worn\r\n3,500 feet of Cretaceous, and from 500 to 1,500 feet of the Jura-Trias\r\nseries, which is here about 3,000 feet thick. From the summit of the\r\narch more than 2,500 feet of the Jura-Trias have been removed.\r\n\r\nThe strata exposed high up on the mountain being older than those at the\r\nbase, and the dip being everywhere directed away from the center, it is\r\nevident that the mountain is surrounded by concentric outcrops of beds\r\nwhich lift their escarpments toward it. It is usually the case, where\r\nthe strata which incline against the flank of a mountain are eroded,\r\nthat the softer are excavated the more rapidly, while the harder are\r\nleft standing in _ridges_; and an alternation of beds suitable for the\r\nformation of a ridge occurs here. One of the upturned beds is the\r\nmassive Vermilion Cliff sandstone, and beneath it are the shales of the\r\nShinarump Group. By the yielding of the shales the sandstone is left\r\nprominent, and it circles the base of the mountain in a monoclinal\r\nridge. But the ridge is of a peculiar character, and has really no title\r\nto the name except in the homology of its structure with that of the\r\ntypical monoclinal ridge. It lacks the continuity which is implied by\r\nthe word “ridge”. The drainage of Mount Ellsworth is from the center of\r\nthe dome outward. A half dozen drainage lines originate in the high\r\ncrests and pass outward through the zone of upturned strata. Lower down\r\ntheir interspaces are divided by others, and when they reach the\r\ncircling escarpment of the Vermilion sandstone their number is fifteen.\r\nEach of these cuts the ridge to its base, and the effect of the whole is\r\nto reduce it to a row of sandstone points circling about the mountain.\r\nEach point of sandstone lies against the foot of a mountain spur, as\r\nthough it had been built for a _retaining wall_ to resist the out-thrust\r\nof the spur. Borrowing a name from the analogy, I shall call these\r\nelementary ridges _revet-crags_, and speak of the spurs which bear them\r\nas being _revetted_. The accompanying sketch is designed to illustrate\r\nthe structure, but is not drawn from nature. In the view of Mount\r\nHillers (Figure 27) the revetments may be seen, and in the bird’s-eye\r\nview of the Henry Mountains (Plate V), as well as in the Frontispiece,\r\nthe revet-crags of Mount Ellsworth also are portrayed. The diagram of\r\nthe north spur of Mount Ellsworth (Figure 14) shows the revet-crag of\r\nthat spur at _V_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 15.—Revet-Crags.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe revet-crags of Vermilion sandstone follow, in a general way, the\r\nline of maximum dip about the base of Mount Ellsworth; but a few of them\r\nrise higher, and one—that which joins the northwest spur—climbs until it\r\nis but little lower than the summit of the mountain. Outside the circle\r\nof Vermilion Cliff sandstone lies the Gray Cliff sandstone, and in a few\r\nplaces it takes the form of a revetment. Inside the same circle there\r\nare many revetments, constituted by trachyte sheets bedded in Shinarump\r\nshales (Figure 14). Conforming perfectly with the strata, the sheets\r\nyield by erosion forms which are identical with those afforded by hard\r\nsedimentary beds, and to the distant eye the impression of the arching\r\nstructure of Mount Ellsworth is conveyed less by what can be seen of the\r\nstrata than by ascending revetments of trachyte sheets, which simulate\r\nand interpret the strata.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 16.—Mount Holmes, from the north.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe laccolite of Mount Ellsworth is not exposed to view, but I am\r\nnevertheless confident of its existence—that the visible arching strata\r\nenvelop it, that the visible forest of dikes join it, and that the\r\nvisible faulted blocks of the upper mountain achieved their displacement\r\nwhile floated by the still liquid lava. The proof, however, is not in\r\nthe mountain itself, but depends on the association of the phenomena of\r\ncurvature and dike and sheet with laccolites, in other mountains of the\r\nsame group. In the sequel these will be described, but it chances that\r\nthe mountain next to be considered is even less developed by erosion\r\nthan Mount Ellsworth.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             MOUNT HOLMES.\r\n\r\nThe order of sequence which places Mount Ellsworth before Mount Holmes\r\nis the order of complexity. The former contains one laccolite, the\r\nlatter two. Neither of the two is visible, but the strata which envelop\r\nthem shadow forth their forms and leave no question of their duality.\r\nThey are so closely combined that the lesser seems a mere appendage of\r\nthe greater. From the center of the greater there is a descent of strata\r\nin all directions, but from the center of the lesser the rocks incline\r\ntoward one-half only of the horizon. Where the two convex arches join\r\nthere is a curved groin—a zone of concave curvature uniting the two\r\nconvexities. About the compound figure can be obscurely seen a line of\r\nmaximum dip, and beyond that the fading of the curves. The curves\r\nthroughout are so gentle that it was found exceedingly difficult to\r\nestablish their limits. In a general way it may be said that each of the\r\nHolmes arches is as broad as the Ellsworth arch, but the vertical\r\ndisplacement is less. In the formation of the greater Holmes arch the\r\namount of uplift was 3,000 feet; for the lesser arch, 1,500 feet.\r\n\r\nThere is no evidence in the forms of the arches which proves one to be\r\nolder than the other. Studying the curves in the field, I could not\r\ndiscover that either arch asserted itself more strongly than the other\r\nin their common ground. They seem to meet upon equal terms. Still it is\r\nprobable, _a priori_, that they were formed successively and not\r\nsimultaneously. The coincidence in time of two eruptions of lava from\r\nneighboring vents is no more unlikely than the coincidence of the two\r\nirruptions, and the same principle of least resistance which causes\r\nindividual laccolitic arches to assume spheroidal forms, would have\r\ngiven to the compound arch of two laccolites, coincident in time, a\r\nsimple instead of a compound form.\r\n\r\nAssuming that the arches were successive in origin I shall in another\r\nand more appropriate chapter discuss the problem of their chronological\r\norder in the light of their somewhat peculiar drainage system.\r\n\r\nThe lesser arch betrays no dikes nor sheets. The Vermilion Cliff\r\nsandstone covers it to the top. The greater is crowned by a few grand\r\ndikes which govern its topography. From the center a long dike runs to\r\nthe south, a short one to the north, two to the east, and one to the\r\nwest. The course of each is a mountain spur, and between them are\r\namphitheaters and gorges. Clinging to the dikes are bodies of altered\r\nsandstone, but the great sandstone masses of the summit were unaltered\r\nand from them have been excavated the gorges. Along the dike-filled\r\nfissures there has been some faulting, but there is no reason to believe\r\nthat the displacement is great in amount. Toward the flanks of the\r\nmountain there are a few sheets, the outermost of which is far within\r\nthe line of maximum flexure. Their escarpments instead of facing upward\r\nlike the revetting sheets of Mount Ellsworth, face downward; their\r\nburied and unknown edges are the edges toward the mountain. Their\r\nthinning toward the periphery of the arch is conspicuous to the eye in\r\nmany instances, as is also the thinning of the dikes.\r\n\r\nAnother peculiarity of dike form, one which has since been noted in a\r\nnumber of localities, was first detected in Mount Holmes. It consists in\r\na definite upper limit. The dike so marked is often as even upon its\r\nupper surface as an artificial stone wall. The upper surface may be\r\nlevel or may incline toward one end of the dike, but in either case it\r\nis sure to be found parallel to the bedding of the strata which inclose\r\nthe dike. This fact led to the suspicion, afterward confirmed by more\r\ndirect evidence, that the flat top of the dike was molded by an unbroken\r\nstratum of rock bridging across the fissure which the lava filled\r\n(Figure 20). The converse phenomenon can be observed in the ridge which\r\njoins Mounts Ellsworth and Holmes. A great dike there forms the crest of\r\nthe ridge for half a mile, its base being buried in sandstone; but at\r\nthe end of the ridge the strata are seen to be continuous beneath it\r\n(Figure 21).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 17.—Stereogram of the Holmes Arches; an ideal restoration of the\r\n    form of the overarching strata.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 18.—Ideal cross-section of the Laccolites of Mount Holmes.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 19.—A flat-topped dike.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 20.—Ideal Cross-section of Flat-topped Dikes; _a_, before\r\n    denudation; _b_, after denudation.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 21.—Ideal Cross-section of a Flat-bottomed Dike.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 22.—Diagram to illustrate a hypothetical explanation of\r\n    Flat-edged Dikes.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThat a fissure several feet or several scores of feet in width should\r\nend thus abruptly, demands explanation, and the phenomena immediately\r\nconcerned offer none. Nevertheless it is easy to make an assumption\r\nwhich if true renders both cases clear. If we assume that the fissure\r\ninstead of ending at the crosshead is merely offset, and resumes its\r\ncourse beyond, and that the dike contained in it has two bodies\r\nconnected by a thin sheet (Figure 22), we shall have no difficulty in\r\nconceiving the erosion which will produce either of the natural\r\nappearances described.\r\n\r\nThe rocks which constitute Mount Holmes are the same as those about its\r\nbase. The Vermilion Cliff and Gray Cliff Sandstones alone appear in the\r\ncrests. The underlying Shinarump shales are cut by the erosion at a few\r\npoints only, and those are near the base. For this reason the Vermilion\r\nSandstone is not undermined about the base, and the circle of\r\nrevet-crags which surrounds Mount Ellsworth finds no counterpart. There\r\nare, indeed, a few revetments of Gray Cliff sandstone, but they are\r\nscattered and for the most part inconspicuous.\r\n\r\nIn the general view of Mount Holmes (Figure 16), one of the main dikes\r\ncrowns the nearest spur, and another the spur leading to the right. At\r\nthe left are minor dikes, and high up is a trap sheet notched on its\r\nlower edge. At the left base of the mountain lies the lesser arch.\r\n\r\nFigure 23 gives a section exhibited by one of the northward cañons. It\r\nshows one of the faults of the upper part of the arch and illustrates\r\nthe thinning of the sheets as they descend.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 23.—Section shown in a northward cañon of Mount Holmes. _a_,\r\n    Vestige of Trachyte sheet. _b_ _b_ _b_, Trachyte sheets. _c_,\r\n    Trachyte dike. 1, Gray Cliff Sandstone. 2 2, Purple Sandstone. 3,\r\n    Vermilion Cliff Sandstone. 4, Shinarump Shale.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                             MOUNT HILLERS.\r\n\r\nNext in order to the north is Mount Hillers. Let it not be supposed,\r\nhowever, that there is discernible system in the geographic arrangement\r\nof the mountains or of the laccolites. A chart of the mountain peaks and\r\na chart of the laccolites would alike prove intractable in the hands of\r\nthose geologists who draw parallel lines through groups of volcanic\r\nvents by way of showing their trend. They are as perfectly heterotactous\r\nas they could be made by an artificial arrangement.\r\n\r\nThe diagram (Figure 24) shows the relation of the laccolite groups to\r\neach other and to the meridian. The principal mountain summits are\r\nindicated by triangles, and the curved lines inclose areas of\r\ndisturbance.\r\n\r\nMount Hillers and its foot-hills are constituted by a group of no less\r\nthan eight laccolites, and a ninth, the Howell laccolite, is\r\nconveniently classed with them, although not contiguous.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 25.—Cross-section of Mount Hillers.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 26.—The same, with ideal representation of the underground\r\n    structure.\r\n\r\n  Scale, 1 inch = 4,000 feet. 1.

The full black lines represent trachyte sheets, and\r\n    the broad black area the\r\n  Hillers Laccolite.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 27.—Mount Hillers, from the south.\r\n]\r\n\r\n_The Hillers laccolite_ is the largest in the Henry Mountains. Its depth\r\nis about 7,000 feet, and its diameters are four miles and three and\r\nthree-quarter miles. Its volume is about ten cubic miles. The upper half\r\nconstitutes the mountain, the lower half the mountain’s deep-laid\r\nfoundation. Of the portion which is above ground, so to speak, and\r\nexposed to atmospheric degradation, less than one-half has been stripped\r\nof its cover of overarching strata. The remainder is still mantled and\r\nshielded by sedimentary beds and by many interleaved sheets of trachyte.\r\nThe portion which has been uncovered is not left in its original shape,\r\nbut is sculptured into alpine forms and scored so deeply that not less\r\nthan 1,000 feet of its mass are shown in section. All about the eroded\r\n(south) face of the mountain the base is revetted by walls of Vermilion\r\nand Gray Cliff sandstone, strengthened by trachyte sheets. At the\r\nextreme south these stand nearly vertical (80°), and their inclination\r\ndiminishes gradually in each direction, until at the east and west bases\r\nof the mountain it is not more than 60°. On the north side there are no\r\nrevet-crags, and the inclination is comparatively slight. It would\r\nappear that the laccolite was asymmetric, and was so much steeper-sided\r\non the south that that side suffered most rapid degradation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 24.—Ground Plan of the Henry Mountains. The curved lines show the\r\n    limits of the principal displacements; the triangles, the positions\r\n    of the main peaks. N, Mount Ellen. P, Mount Pennell. H, Mount\r\n    Hillers. M, Mount Holmes. E, Mount Ellsworth.\r\n]\r\n\r\nBy reference to the section (Figure 25) it will be seen that the\r\nsedimentary strata of the north flank stretch quite to the summit of the\r\nmountain. The same beds which form the revet-crags on the southern base\r\nconstitute also some of the highest peaks. Since these rest directly\r\nupon the laccolite, it is assumed that the next lower beds of the\r\nstratigraphic series form its floor; and the base of the laccolite is\r\ndrawn in the ideal section on the level which the Shinarump Group holds\r\nwhere it is unaffected by the displacements of the mountain.\r\n\r\nIt is noteworthy that wherever the sedimentaries appear upon the\r\nmountain top they are highly metamorphic. But in the revet-crags there\r\nis very little alteration. Massive sandstone, divided by sheets and\r\ndikes several hundred feet in thickness, is discolored and indurated at\r\nthe contact surface only, and ten feet away betrays no change.\r\n\r\nThe engraving of Mount Hillers (Figure 27) exhibits the south face with\r\nits revet-crags and bold spurs of trap. In nature the effect is\r\nheightened by the contrast of color, the bright red revetments being\r\nstrongly relieved against the dark gray of the laccolite. The strata of\r\nthe summits cannot be discriminated at a distance. They are too near the\r\nlaccolite in hardness to differ from it in the style of their sculpture.\r\n\r\nOf the minor laccolites of the cluster there are three so closely joined\r\nto the chief that they merge topographically with the mountain. They are\r\nnot well exposed for study. The smallest, which overlooks the pass\r\nbetween Mount Hillers and Mount Pennell (A, Figure 28) has probably lost\r\nthe whole of its cover and with it so much of its substance that the\r\noriginal form and surface cannot be seen. Its floor is probably the\r\nTununk sandstone. East of it and lying a little deeper in the Cretaceous\r\nseries is a second laccolite (B), broader, lower, and less eroded. The\r\nthird (C) joins the great one on the northeast, and is so closely united\r\nthat it was at first supposed to be the same body. Later examinations\r\nhave shown, however, that its immediate roof is the Henry’s Fork\r\nconglomerate, and its horizon is thus established as more than two\r\nthousand feet above that of its great companion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 30.—The Steward Laccolite.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 28.—Diagram of the Hillers Cluster of Laccolites; Ground plan.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 29.—Diagram of the Hillers Cluster of Laccolites; Elevation.\r\n\r\n  The upper horizontal line marks the base of the Cretaceous; the\r\n    middle, the base of\r\n  the Jura-Trias; the lower, the level of the sea.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe _Steward laccolite_ (Figure 30) is better exposed for study. It was\r\nburied in the soft bad-land sandstone of the Flaming Gorge Group, and\r\nits matrix has been so far washed away that nearly the whole body of\r\ntrap is revealed. It is weathered out, like a chert-nodule on the face\r\nof a block of limestone. At one end it is bared quite to the base, and\r\nthe sandstone floor on which it rests is brought in sight. The waste of\r\nthe sandstone has undermined its edge, and a small portion of the\r\nlaccolite has fallen away. Near the opposite end a fragment of its cover\r\nof arching sandstone survives—just enough to indicate that the\r\nsedimentaries were once bent over it, and that the smooth low-arching\r\nsurface which now crowns it portrays the original form which the molten\r\nlava assumed. The laccolite is about two and a half miles long and one\r\nand one-half broad. The height of its eastward face, where it is sapped\r\nby the erosion of the bad-land rock, is six hundred feet, and the\r\ncentral depth must be more than eight hundred feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 31.—Cross-section of the Pulpit arch, with ideal representation\r\n    of the Pulpit Laccolite.

The drainage from Mount Hillers\r\ncrosses it from west to east and has given it an oblique truncation, as\r\nillustrated in the diagram. At the upper end of the slope the Henry’s\r\nFork conglomerate outcrops; at the lower end the base of the Flaming\r\nGorge series, and in the interval the Gray Cliff sandstone is lifted to\r\nthe surface. The same streams which planed away the crown of the arch\r\nhave now cut themselves deeper channels and divide the massive sandstone\r\nby picturesque cañons, between which it is grotesquely carved into\r\npinnacles and ridges. A curious salient of the sandstone has given its\r\nname to the arch. How deeply the Pulpit laccolite lies buried is not\r\nknown, no sheet nor dike of trachyte betraying its proximity. The valley\r\nof the Colorado may have to be deepened thousands of feet before it will\r\nbe laid bare.\r\n\r\n_The Jerry Butte_ is the most conspicuous adjunct to Mount Hillers and\r\ntopographically is more important and striking than the features which\r\nhave just been described, but its structure is less clear. Its crest is\r\nformed by a great dike several hundred feet in width and two miles in\r\nlength, and with an even top like those observed on Mount Holmes. The\r\nwestern end of the dike is the higher and forms the culminating point of\r\nthe butte, and from it there radiate three other dikes of notable size.\r\nThe inclosing strata, preserved from erosion only by the shelter of the\r\ndikes, are the lower portion of the Cretaceous series, and they are so\r\nlittle lifted above their normal level that there is room for no\r\nconsiderable laccolite beneath them. The inclination of the beds is so\r\ncomplicated by the dips of the Pulpit, Steward, and Hillers arches, all\r\nof which are contiguous, that nothing can be made out of the form of the\r\nlaccolite, if it exists.\r\n\r\n_The Howell laccolite_ lies apart from the cluster and is well exposed.\r\nIt differs from all that have been enumerated in its extreme thinness.\r\nWith a breadth of more than two thousand feet, it has a depth of only\r\nfifty. Seen from the east, it might readily be mistaken for a _coulée_,\r\nfor on that side it is the thin, hard, black cap of a table carved out\r\nof soft, sandy shale (Flaming Gorge Group) by circumdenudation. But\r\nfollowed westward, the table is found gradually to lose its height by\r\nthe rising of the adjacent land, and at last the lava-bed runs into the\r\nslope and disappears beneath the upper layers of the same sandy shale on\r\nwhich it rests. How far it extends under ground can only be conjectured.\r\nHow far it originally stretched in the opposite direction cannot be\r\nknown because it is broken away. The original edge is concealed at one\r\nend and has been undermined and destroyed at the other, so that the only\r\nplace where it can be seen is the point at which it emerges from the\r\nshale. At this point, where erosion has bared but has not yet attacked\r\nthe lava, the form and character of the edge are exhibited. In place of\r\nthe tapering wedge which usually terminates intrusive sheets, there is a\r\nblunt, rounded margin, and the lava scarcely diminishes in depth in\r\napproaching it. The underlying strata, locally hardened to sandstones,\r\nlie level; the overlying curve downward to join them, and between the\r\ncurved strata is interleaved a curved lava-sheet. In all these\r\ncharacters the intrusive body is affiliated with the typical laccolites,\r\nand distinguished from the typical sheets.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 32.—The Howell Laccolite, as seen from the north.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 33.—The Edge of the Howell Laccolite.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 34.—Mount Pennell, from the west.\r\n]\r\n\r\n_The laccolite which is marked “D”_ on the diagrams of the Hillers\r\ncluster is identical in nearly all its characters with the Howell; it is\r\nthin and broad. One margin is wasting as its foundation is sapped; the\r\nother is hidden from view. Its depth does not diminish toward the edge.\r\nMoreover, a few dikes issue from its margin, or from beneath its margin.\r\nIt was intruded within the same formation as the Howell (the Flaming\r\nGorge shale), but at a horizon several hundred feet higher; and, what is\r\nspecially noteworthy, the rock of which it is composed is identical in\r\n_facies_ with that of the Howell laccolite, and notably different from\r\nall others which were observed in the Hillers cluster.\r\n\r\nThus there are grouped in this one cluster laccolites of the most varied\r\ncharacter, differing in form, in magnitude, in the stratigraphic depth\r\nat which they were intruded, in the extent to which they have been\r\nuncovered or demolished in the progress of erosion, and also, but very\r\nslightly, in their lithologic characters. The greatest is one thousand\r\ntimes as bulky as the least. The length of the most obese is three times\r\nits depth; the length of the most attenuated is more than one hundred\r\ntimes its depth. The one highest in the strata lies a thousand feet\r\nabove the base of the Cretaceous rock series; the lowest is not higher\r\nthan the summit of the Carboniferous. The latter has not yet been\r\ntouched by erosion, others have been completely denuded, and some have\r\nbeen partially demolished and removed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             MOUNT PENNELL.\r\n\r\nMount Pennell and Mount Ellen are distinct mountain masses separated by\r\na low pass, but there is no interval between the clusters of laccolites\r\nby which they are constituted.\r\n\r\nWhether the site of a laccolite shall be marked by a mountain depends in\r\ngreat measure on the relation of the laccolite to the progress of\r\nerosion. In the Henry Mountains the laccolites which have not been\r\nreached by the denudation scarcely affect the topography. The arched\r\nsedimentaries above them are no harder than the same strata in the\r\nsurrounding plain, and they are brought substantially to the same level.\r\nIt is to those which the downward progress of erosion has reached and\r\npassed that the mountains are due. In virtue of their hardness they\r\nsurvive the general degradation, and conserve with them broad\r\nfoundations of more perishable material. Mounts Ellen and Pennell mark\r\nthe positions of the highest of a great cluster of laccolites, and the\r\npass between them marks a part of the cluster where all the laccolites\r\nlie low in the strata.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 35.—Cross-section of Mount Pennell. 1, Blue Gate Sandstone. 2, 2,\r\n    Blue Gate Shale. 3, 3, Tununk Sandstone. The full black lines\r\n    represent Trachyte.\r\n]\r\n\r\nMount Pennell is not so easily studied as the lower mountains at the\r\nsouth. Its summits are timbered and are carved into alpine forms which\r\ndo not portray the structure but rather mask it. Upon its flanks however\r\nthe topography and the structure are in so close sympathy that the\r\nlatter is easily read; and by their study some of the general features\r\nof the mountain have been made out. From the east and south and west the\r\nstrata can be seen to rise toward it. The uprising strata on the west\r\nare the Tununk sandstone and the shales above and below it. The\r\nsandstone forms no revetments, but accords so closely in its dips with\r\nthe slopes of the mountain that it is the surface rock over a broad\r\narea, outcropping wherever there is rock exposure. At the head of the\r\nfoot-slope trachyte sheets are associated with it, some overlying and\r\nothers underlying it; and at one point a gorge reveals a laccolite not\r\nfar below it—a laccolite that may or may not be the great nucleus of the\r\nmountain. On the west and south flanks the uprising strata are the Blue\r\nGate and Tununk sandstones, with their shales. The Gate sandstone has\r\nbeen worn away nearly to the foot of the slope, and forms a monoclinal\r\nridge circling about the base. The ridge is interrupted by a number of\r\nwaterways, and it sends salients well up upon the flank, but it is too\r\ncontinuous to be regarded as a mere line of revetments. The Tununk\r\nsandstone is not to be seen without search, being covered by heavy\r\ntrachyte sheets. Trachyte sheets also underlie it, and the whole are\r\ncarved into a conspicuous series of revet-crags.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 36.—Mount Pennell, from the north.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe association of overarching strata with sheets of trachyte leaves no\r\ndoubt in my mind that the core of Mount Pennell is laccolitic, but\r\nwhether it is simple or compound is not so clear. The collation of all\r\nthe observed dips shows that if there be but one laccolite it has not\r\nthe simplicity of form which usually characterizes them.\r\n\r\nThere are low arches of the strata at the southern, northern, and\r\nnortheastern bases, which reveal no trachyte and give the impression\r\nthat there may be a foundation of low-lying laccolites upon which the\r\nmain trachyte mass or masses of the mountain are based. One of these low\r\narches, that at the northeast, is shown in the foreground of Figure 36.\r\nThe strata which portray it are of the Henry’s Fork conglomerate, and\r\nthe laccolite which they cover is of necessity distinct from that which\r\nis revealed on the east flank of the mountain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 37.—Sentinel Butte.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn addition to the laccolites of the foundation and of the main body,\r\nthere is a series which jut forth from the northern flank like so many\r\ndormer windows. They are comparatively small but are rendered\r\nconspicuous by the removal of the soft rocks which originally inclosed\r\nthem. They are higher in the strata than any other observed laccolites,\r\ntheir position being above the Tununk sandstone and in the Blue Gate\r\nshale. The core of the main body of the mountain is probably inclosed in\r\nthe Tununk shale, and the laccolites under the low arches (at the north\r\nat least) are entirely below the Cretaceous. The higher series stand on\r\ntop of the low arches, and are just outside of the sheets which inclose\r\nthe central body. The largest of them constitutes Sentinel Butte, and\r\nstands guard over Penellen Pass. Sapped by the yielding of its soft\r\nfoundation it is rapidly wasting, and on three sides its faces are\r\nprecipitous. The huge blocks which cleave from it as they are undermined\r\nstrew the surrounding slopes for a great distance. Its depth of 400 feet\r\nis made up of two layers, of which the lower is the deeper, and between\r\nwhich there is a slight lithologic difference. The upper surface of the\r\nbutte is smooth and plane with an inclination to the south. It is\r\nprobably a portion of the original surface of the laccolite.\r\n\r\nThus we have in Mount Pennell a great central body consisting of a\r\nsingle laccolite or of a number closely massed together; an inferior\r\ngroup of three or more, evidenced by low broad arches; and a superior\r\ngroup of not less than four, all of which are partially destroyed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              MOUNT ELLEN.\r\n\r\nThe crest of Mount Ellen is as lofty as that of Mount Pennell and it is\r\nmore extended. It stretches for two miles from north to south and is\r\nbuttressed by many spurs.\r\n\r\nThe sculpture of the crest is alpine, and the structure is consequently\r\nobscured. There are dikes of trachyte and perhaps the remnants of\r\nlaccolites; there are Cretaceous sandstones greatly indurated; and there\r\nare Cretaceous shales baked to clinking slate; but they are all carved\r\ninto smooth, pyramidal forms, and each is half hidden by the _débris_\r\nfrom the rest so that their order and meaning cannot be seen.\r\n\r\nThe flanks however are full of interest to the geologist. The Ellen\r\ncluster of laccolites is a broad one, and all but the central portion is\r\nwell exposed for study. In the spurs and foot-slopes and marginal buttes\r\nno less than sixteen individual laccolites have been discriminated, a\r\nnumber of them most beautifully displayed. They will be enumerated in\r\nthe order of their position, beginning at the west of Penellen Pass and\r\npassing along the western, northern, and eastern flanks to the Scrope\r\nButte, east of the pass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 38.—Ground Plan of the Ellen Cluster of Laccolites.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn the chart of the Ellen cluster, Figure 38, an attempt is made to show\r\nthe horizontal grouping of the laccolites and the order of their\r\nsuperposition wherever they overlap. It will be observed that where the\r\nlimits are imperfectly known the outlines are left incomplete, and that\r\nthe central area remains blank, not because it contains no trachyte\r\nmasses, but because its alpine sculpture has prevented their study.\r\nWhere it is not evident which of two encroaching laccolites is the\r\nsuperior, they are separated by a straight line.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 40.—Section of the Lewis Creek Cañon through the Newberry Arch.\r\n    1, Henry’s Fork Conglomerate. 2, Upper portion of Flaming Gorge\r\n    Shale. 3, Newberry Laccolite.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe line _a a_ in the chart is the springing line of a broad, flat arch\r\nwhich underlies all the other arches of the western flank. If it covers\r\nbut one laccolite, that one is the rival in magnitude of the Hillers\r\nnucleus, although widely different in proportions; but it is more\r\nprobable that it contains a greater number. The upper surface is rolling\r\nand uneven, and has not the degree of symmetry which laccolites usually\r\ndisplay. At the points _b_, _c_, _d_, and _e_ the altitude of the arch\r\nis 3,800, 3,500, 2,000 (estimated) and 2,500 feet. Nevertheless there is\r\nnothing in its simple outline to indicate a compound structure; the\r\nmonoclinal ridges by which it is margined do not exhibit the flexuous\r\ncurves which are commonly seen about the bases of confluent arches.\r\nWhether the nucleus is simple or compound it sends no branches to the\r\nsurface; the only outcrops of trachyte belong to the overlying arches.\r\nThe upper parts of the arch have been so carried away that the steepness\r\nof the mountain flank is not increased by it, and inferior strata are\r\nbrought to the surface. At the north the crown of the arch bears the\r\nHenry’s Fork conglomerate, while beyond its base the plateau is built of\r\nBlue Gate sandstone. At the south the arch bears the Tununk sandstone,\r\nand the Masuk lies outside.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 39.—The Newberry Arch and Laccolite.\r\n]\r\n\r\n_The laccolite marked “E”_ on the chart rests upon the Tununk sandstone.\r\nThe Blue Gate shale which once buried it has been all washed away except\r\nsome metamorphosed remnants upon the top, and the trachyte itself has\r\nwasted to such an extent that its original form cannot be traced. The\r\nlaccolite has no near neighbor, and the erosion has left it prominent\r\nupon the mountain flank. A continuous and solitary spur joins it to the\r\ncentral ridge.\r\n\r\n_The Newberry laccolite_ makes a knob 1,700 feet high, and stands by\r\nitself. Its cover of Henry’s Fork conglomerate is re-enforced by a\r\nnumber of trachyte sheets, and is broken through at one point only. At\r\nthat point Lewis Creek cuts with a straight course across a flank of the\r\narch, and exposes a portion of the nucleus in section (Figures 39 and\r\n40). The conglomerate does not rest directly upon the trachyte, but is\r\nseparated by one or two hundred feet of shale of the Flaming Gorge\r\nGroup.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 41.—The Geikie Laccolite (_G_), overlapped by the Henry’s Fork\r\n    Conglomerate (_H H_), and the Shoulder Laccolite (_S_).\r\n]\r\n\r\nTwo miles to the northward is the _Geikie laccolite_, smaller than the\r\nrest but similar in character. It lies close to the top of the Flaming\r\nGorge shale, and is enwrapped by the Henry’s Fork conglomerate. Upon\r\nthree sides the conglomerate can be seen to curve over its margin from\r\ntop to bottom, and upon two of these sides the curves are so broken\r\nthrough by erosion that the trachyte is visible within. On the north two\r\ncañons cut down to the nucleus, and on the south there is a broad face\r\nof trachyte framed all about by the cut edges of the conglomerate beds.\r\n\r\n_The Shoulder laccolite_ overlaps the Geikie, and the two are exposed in\r\nsuch manner as to show their relation in section. The conglomerate runs\r\nunder the one and over the other and separates them. The upper laccolite\r\nis a broad and deep one, and takes its name from the fact that it makes\r\na great shoulder or terrace on the mountain side. Toward the mountain it\r\nis buried; toward the valley it is uncovered, and in part bounded by a\r\ncliff. It is deeply cleft by cañons. It has not been subjected to\r\nmeasurement, but its depth is not overestimated at fifteen hundred feet\r\nnor its area at five square miles.\r\n\r\nIn the sketch (Figure 42) many of these features can be traced—the\r\nGeikie laccolite at the left and the Shoulder in the center, with an\r\noutcrop of the conglomerate curving down from the roof of the one to the\r\nfloor of the other, and the Newberry arch in the foreground with its\r\ncleft side. At the rear is the pyramidal Ellen Peak and the _F_\r\nlaccolite, overlooking the Shoulder. In the distance at the left is the\r\nMarvine laccolite.\r\n\r\nLittle more can be said of the _F laccolite_ than that it exists and is\r\nthe nucleus of a lofty spur. Its summit rises too nearly to the crest of\r\nthe mountain to be well defined, and at its base the sedimentaries are\r\nhidden by talus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 42.—The Western Flank of Mount Ellen. _N_, Newberry Arch; _S_,\r\n    Shoulder Laccolite; _G_, Geikie Laccolite.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 43.—The Northern face of the Marvine Laccolite.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 44.—The Western face of the Marvine Laccolite.\r\n]\r\n\r\nNot so the _Marvine laccolite_. Lying at the foot of the mountain where\r\nerosion is so conditioned as to discriminate between hard and soft, and\r\nsurrounded by nothing firmer than the Tununk shale and Tununk sandstone,\r\nit has suffered a rapid denudation, in which nearly the whole of its\r\ncover has been carried away without seriously impairing its form. It\r\nstands forth on a pedestal, devoid of talus, naked and alone. The upper\r\nsurface undulates in low waves preserving the original form as it was\r\nimpressed on the molten mass. Over a portion there is a thin coating of\r\nsandstone, the layer next to the trachyte being saved from destruction\r\nby the induration acquired during the hot contact. From the remainder\r\nthis also has disappeared, and the contact face of the trachyte is bare.\r\nFor some reason the exterior portion of the laccolite disintegrates more\r\nslowly than the interior. It may be that there was some reaction from\r\nthe surrounding sedimentaries during the cooling, which modified the\r\ncrystallization. Or it may be that at a later epoch a reciprocal\r\nmetamorphism was induced along the contact of the diverse rocks. At all\r\nevents there is a crust a few feet in thickness which is specially\r\nqualified to resist destructive agents, and which by this peculiarity\r\ncan be distinguished from the trachyte of the interior. All about the\r\nnorthern and western faces, which are steep, this crust has been broken\r\nthrough and the interior excavated; but it is only along the upper edge\r\nof the face that the crust is completely destroyed. Along the lower edge\r\nit is preserved in remnants sufficiently numerous to fully define the\r\noutline of the base. Each remnant is a sort of revet-crag standing\r\nnearly vertical and joined by a buttress to the cliff behind it. In the\r\naccompanying sketches (Figures 43 and 44) the most of these features\r\nfind better expression than words can give them. The solemn order of the\r\ntombstone-like revetments is not exaggerated, nor is the contrast\r\nbetween the ruggedness of the cliff and the smoothness of the upper\r\ncrust. At the left in the upper view, and at the right in the lower,\r\nthere can be seen inclined strata, the remnants of the arch which once\r\ncovered the whole.\r\n\r\nThe extreme depth of the laccolite is 1,200 feet, and its diameters are\r\n6,000 and 4,000 feet.\r\n\r\n_The G arch_, the Dana, the Crescent, and the Maze agree in having no\r\nvisible laccolites. They are mere dome-like uplifts, by which inferior\r\nbeds are brought to light. In the middle of the Crescent arch, and there\r\nonly, is a small dike. They differ in their dimensions and in their\r\nerosion and topography. The G arch is low and broad, and lifts the\r\nHenry’s Fork conglomerate a few hundred feet only. It is covered by that\r\nbed except where Bowl Creek and one or two others cross it in shallow\r\ncañons.\r\n\r\n_The Dana arch_ bears the same relation to Mount Ellen and Jukes Butte\r\nthat the Pulpit arch bears to Mount Hillers. The streams which flow down\r\nhave truncated it, and afterward carved a system of cañons below the\r\nplane of truncation. The Henry’s Fork conglomerate overlooks it from the\r\nbase of the Jukes laccolite on one side, and on the other margins it\r\nwith a monoclinal ridge; and in the interval the Flaming Gorge and Gray\r\nCliff rocks come to the surface.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 45.—The Jukes Butte, as seen from the southeast, showing the\r\n    Jukes Laccolite, resting upon the Dana Arch.\r\n]\r\n\r\n_The Crescent arch_ is so perfectly truncated by the existing mountain\r\nstreams that their flood-plains unite above it in a single broad slope.\r\nOn the side toward the mountain there are a few insular hills of the\r\nconglomerate, and on the side toward the plateau the same rock lifts a\r\nlow monoclinal ridge which circles about the base of the arch in a\r\ncrescent. Within the crescent there are few outcrops, but it is probable\r\nthat the Gray Cliff Sandstone is brought to the surface. Near the center\r\na solitary thin dike juts forth, like a buoy set to mark the place where\r\na laccolite is sunk. Judging the magnitude of the laccolite by the\r\nproportions of the uplift, it has a diameter of nearly four miles and a\r\ndepth of 2,500 feet; and these dimensions indicate a volume of three and\r\na half cubic miles.\r\n\r\n_The Maze arch_ covers a smaller area than the Crescent, but its height\r\nis greater. The drainage from the mountain crosses it on a number of\r\nlines, but there is no indication that at any recent stage of the\r\ndegradation they have produced an even truncation. At present they\r\ndivide the Gray and Vermilion Sandstones by so intricate a labyrinth of\r\ndeep cañons that the whole area of the uplift is almost impassable. The\r\nmonotony of red sandstone, for here all members of the Jura-Trias are\r\nbrick-red, the variety of dip, complicated to the eye by oblique\r\nlamination, the multiplicity of cañons and ridges, conspire to give an\r\nimpression of chaos from whatever point the tract is viewed; and even\r\nfrom the most commanding stations I was unable to make out completely\r\nthe arrangement of the drainage lines. Still no faults were discerned,\r\nand it is probable that the Maze arch, intricate as it seems, is a\r\nsimple circular dome. On the north it adjoins the Crescent arch, and the\r\nmonoclinal ridges of conglomerate which margin the two at the east are\r\nconfluent. On the south it adjoins rather more closely one of the low\r\narches which have been referred to the Pennell cluster. On the west, or\r\ntoward the mountain, it is probably met by other arches at its own\r\nlevel; but these if they exist cannot be fully known until the\r\nprogressing degradation of the country shall have removed certain\r\nlaccolites which lie above them and slightly overlap the Maze arch.\r\n\r\nThe four arches just described are of the foundation series of the\r\neastern base, and cover laccolites of unknown depths. Higher in the\r\nstrata, and at the same time absolutely higher, is a second series,\r\nwhich to a certain extent overlap them. The Bowl Creek encroaches on the\r\nG laccolite; the Jukes, on the Dana and on the Bowl Creek; the H\r\nlaccolite, on the Crescent; the Peale and Scrope, on the Maze.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 46.—Cross-section of the Bowl Creek Arch. _c_, _c_ marks the\r\n    water level of Bowl Creek; _l_, the Bowl Creek Laccolite; _a_, _a_,\r\n    Shales; and _s_, the Gryphea Sandstone. Scale, 1 inch = 1,000 feet.\r\n]\r\n\r\n_The Bowl Creek arch_ is so masked by the overlapping Jukes laccolite,\r\nand by the encroachment of certain large dikes, that its general form\r\nand proportions are not known; but it is laid bare at one point in a\r\nfine natural section. Bowl Creek crosses it near the center, and in the\r\nwalls of the cañon are exhibited two hundred feet of the laccolite,\r\ntogether with two hundred and fifty feet of superjacent beds. The curve\r\nof the strata is unbroken by faults or dikes, and carries them below the\r\nlevel of the creek at each end of the cañon. Next above the trachyte\r\nlies a clay shale which has been baked to the hardness of limestone. It\r\nis one hundred feet thick, and is more or less altered throughout, as is\r\nalso the sandstone which overlies it. The extent of the metamorphism\r\nindicates that the trachyte mass by which it was produced is not a mere\r\nsheet, but is the body of the laccolite itself.\r\n\r\n_The Jukes laccolite_ encroaches upon the G, the Dana, and the Bowl\r\nCreek arches, and is superior to them all; it may be said to stand upon\r\nthem. The trachyte has a depth of only one thousand feet, but it lies so\r\nhigh with reference to the general degradation that it is a conspicuous\r\nfeature of the topography. The edges of the laccolite are all eaten\r\naway, and only the central portion survives. All of its faces are\r\nprecipitous. The cover of shale or sandstone has completely disappeared,\r\nand the upper surface seems uneven and worn; but a distant view (Figure\r\n47) shows that its wasting has not progressed so far as to destroy all\r\ntrace of an original even surface. The eminences of the present surface\r\ncombine to give to the eye which is aligned with their plane the\r\nimpression of a straight line. The hill is loftier than the laccolite,\r\nfor under the one thousand feet of trachyte are five hundred feet of\r\nsofter rock which constitute its pedestal, and by their yielding\r\nundermine the laccolite and perpetuate its cliffs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 47.—Profile of the Jukes Butte, as seen from the northwest.\r\n]\r\n\r\n_The H laccolite_ is not well exposed. It lies on one edge of the\r\nCrescent arch and is covered by the Henry’s Fork conglomerate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 48.—The Peale Laccolite exposed in natural cross-section. _a_,\r\n    _b_, _c_, _d_, and _e_ are intrusive masses of trachyte. _H_ is the\r\n    Henry’s Fork Conglomerate.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 49.—The East Flank of Mount Ellen, showing the Scrope, Peale, and\r\n    Jukes Laccolites, and the Maze and Crescent Arches.\r\n]\r\n\r\nLittle is known of the form of the _Peale laccolite_. One edge is lost\r\nin the obscurity of the alpine sculpture, and the other has been removed\r\nalong with the crest of the Maze arch, on which it rested. But by this\r\nremoval a section has been opened across the laccolite, revealing its\r\ninternal structure from top to bottom. It is shown to be composite,\r\nattaining its height of 850 feet by the compilation of three distinct\r\nbeds of trachyte, separated by partings and wedges of shale. The lowest\r\nbed is thin and of small extent. Next is the main bed, six hundred feet\r\nthick and a mile or more broad; and on top is a bed two hundred feet\r\nthick and proportionately narrow. Each of the beds is lenticular in\r\nsection, and the piling of the less upon the greater produces a\r\nquasi-pyramidal form. The interleaved shale bands are metamorphosed to\r\nthe condition of slate. Under the laccolite are one or two hundred feet\r\nof shale, apparently unaltered except at the contact. Then come the\r\nHenry’s Fork conglomerate, 350 feet thick, and the Flaming Gorge shale,\r\nseveral times thicker. Within the upper shale is a restricted trachyte\r\nsheet and near the top of the lower shale is a broader one. The latter\r\nis double throughout, its two layers having been intruded at different\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nThe top of the escarpment is at the top of the laccolite, and only a\r\nshort distance back from the brow are shale and sandstone resting upon\r\nthe trachyte and conforming to its uneven surface.\r\n\r\n_The Scrope laccolite_ resembles the Jukes in everything except that its\r\nerosion has progressed so far as to obliterate every trace of the\r\noriginal upper surface. Its position in the strata is about the same,\r\nand the erosion of its matrix has left it a conspicuous crag. It rests\r\non the flank of the Maze arch, just as the Jukes laccolite rests on the\r\nDana arch. The remnant of trachyte is less than one thousand feet high,\r\nand has been carved into a subconical form in which no hint of the\r\noriginal size and proportions of the trachyte body is conveyed.\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 49 is a view of the east flank of Mount Ellen, as seen from Mount\r\nHillers. It groups together many of the details that have been\r\nenumerated. The conical hill at the left is the Scrope laccolite. The\r\nspur from the mountain which ends just at the right of it is the Peale\r\nlaccolite. The bold butte which terminates the last spur of the mountain\r\nin the distance is the Jukes laccolite. Across the base of the latter\r\none can trace the outcrop of a hard bed. This is the Henry’s Fork\r\nconglomerate, and the upward curve which it shows belongs (probably) to\r\nthe Crescent arch. Nearer than the Jukes Butte and in the same direction\r\nis a low hill, marking the dike within the Crescent. Just to the left of\r\nit is an insular outcrop of the conglomerate, and nearer by is another\r\noutcrop in the form of a cliff, which is continuous to the base of the\r\nPeale laccolite. Between the Peale and Scrope laccolites the\r\nconglomerate is hidden by an embayment of the cliff, and it reappears in\r\nthe base of the Scrope Butte. In all these outcrops the escarpments of\r\nconglomerate face toward the east and at the same time toward the Maze\r\nand Crescent arches. On the opposite side of the arches the same\r\nconglomerate outcrops in a monoclinal ridge with its escarpment facing\r\nto the west. The ridge can be traced in the sketch from a point in the\r\nforeground under the Jukes Butte nearly to the eastern base of the\r\nbutte, the course at first being almost directly toward the butte and\r\nthen curving far to the right and forming the Crescent. Between the\r\nScrope and Peale laccolites on one side and the monoclinal ridge on the\r\nother, lie the Maze and the Maze arch. Beyond the Maze arch and limited\r\nat the right by the Crescent, is the Crescent arch. The Scrope, the\r\nPeale, and the Jukes are visible laccolites; the Maze and Crescent\r\narches cover invisible laccolites.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe determinate laccolites and arches which compose the lower slopes of\r\nMount Ellen, while they are of prime importance for purposes of\r\ninvestigation, must not be considered superior in number and magnitude\r\nto those of the central region. That region is known to abound in\r\ntrachyte masses, and it far exceeds the marginal district in the extent\r\nand degree of its metamorphism. There is every reason to believe that\r\nthe mountain crest marks the zone of greatest igneous activity, and that\r\nthe foot-hills are as truly subsidiary from a geological point of view\r\nas they are from a topographic. There is no evidence of a great central\r\nlaccolite, such as the Hillers and Pennell clusters possess, and I am\r\ndisposed to regard the mountain as a great congeries of trachyte masses\r\nof moderate size, separated and in the main covered by shales and\r\nsandstones. The sedimentary strata of the summits are all of the\r\nCretaceous series, but they are too greatly altered to permit the\r\ndiscrimination of the Masuk, Gate, and Tununk groups. The Henry’s Fork\r\nconglomerate, which might have been recognized even in a metamorphic\r\ncondition, was not seen.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   STEREOGRAM OF THE HENRY MOUNTAINS.\r\n\r\nFor the double purpose of mapping and studying the mountains a model in\r\nrelief was constructed, in which great pains was taken to give all the\r\nprincipal features their proper altitudes and proportions. This model\r\nwas photographed, and has been reproduced by the heliotype process in\r\nPlate III, at the end of the volume. After it had been completed, a\r\nsecond model was constructed by adding to the surface of the first.\r\nWherever the Blue Gate sandstone appeared in the original model no\r\naddition was made. Where the Tununk sandstone appeared there was added\r\nan amount equivalent to the combined thickness of the Blue Gate\r\nsandstone and the Blue Gate shale; and in general, enough was added in\r\nevery part to bring the surface up to the summit of the Blue Gate\r\nsandstone. In this way a restoration was made of the form of that\r\nsandstone previous to its erosion. It is not to be understood that the\r\nmountains ever possessed this form; for when the surface of the Blue\r\nGate sandstone was unbroken by erosion it was unbroken only because it\r\nwas covered by other strata, which while they shielded it were\r\nthemselves eroded. If the sandstone had been indestructible, this is the\r\nform which would have been developed by the washing away of all the\r\noverlying beds; and in this form are embodied the arches and domes which\r\nwere impressed upon the sandstone by the upswelling of the laccolites.\r\nThe model became a stereogram of the displacements of the Henry\r\nMountains, and a photograph from the stereogram appears in Plate IV.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that over the central district of Mount Ellen, where\r\nby reason of the peculiar sculpture of the rock its structure was\r\nconcealed, the restoration of the sandstone was not carried; it seemed\r\nbetter to represent our lack of knowledge by a blank than to bridge over\r\nthe interval by the aid of the imagination.\r\n\r\nIf the reader will study the plate, he will find that it expresses a\r\ngreat body of the phenomena which have been described in this chapter.\r\nThe simplicity of the Ellsworth and Holmes arches is contrasted with the\r\ncomplexity of the others; the greatness of the Hillers and Pennell domes\r\nwith the smallness of those which lie upon their flanks. One point that\r\nis especially striking is the relation between the upper and lower domes\r\nof the Ellen cluster. The upper, which give rise to all the conspicuous\r\nfeatures of the mountain flanks, are comparatively small, while the\r\nlower, which might almost be overlooked in a rapid examination of the\r\nmountain, are comparatively large and constitute the great mass of the\r\nuplift. The smaller laccolites, because they are the upper, have been\r\ndenuded of their covers, and in virtue of their hardness stand forth\r\nsalient. The larger, because they are the lower, have not been laid\r\nbare, and the comparatively feeble resistance which their covers have\r\nopposed to erosion has impressed their forms but slightly on the\r\ntopography.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\n                             THE LACCOLITE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe principal facts in regard to the laccolites of the Henry Mountains\r\nhaving been set forth in the preceding chapter, an attempt will now be\r\nmade to deduce from them the natural history of the Laccolite.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a question which the critical geologist will be likely to\r\npropound, and which should be answered at the outset. “What evidence”,\r\nhe may demand, “is there that the origin of the laccolite was subsequent\r\nto the formation of the inclosing strata rather than contemporaneous\r\nwith it? May it not have been buried instead of intruded? May not the\r\nsuccessive sheets and masses of trachyte have been spread or heaped by\r\neruption upon the bottoms of Mesozoic seas, and successively covered by\r\nthe accumulating sediments?” The answer is not difficult.\r\n\r\n1st. No fragment of the trachyte has been discovered in the associated\r\nstrata. The constitution of the several members of the Mesozoic system\r\nin the Henry Mountain region does not differ from the general\r\nconstitution of the same members elsewhere. This evidence is of a\r\nnegative character, but if there were no other it would be sufficient.\r\nFor there is indubitable proof that at the end of the Shinarump period\r\nthe Henry Mountain region was lifted above the ocean, and if any of the\r\nnuclei of the mountains had then existed they could not have escaped\r\nerosion by shore waves, and must have modified the contemporaneous\r\ndeposits.\r\n\r\n2d. The trachyte is in no case vesicular, and in no case fragmental. If\r\nit had been extruded on dry land or in shallow water, where the pressure\r\nupon it was not sufficient to prevent the dilatation of its gases, it\r\nwould have been more or less inflated, after the manner of recent lavas.\r\nIf it had issued at the bottom of an ocean, the rapidity of cooling\r\nwould have cracked the surface of the flow while the interior was yet\r\nmolten and in motion, and breccias of trachyte _débris_ would have\r\nresulted. The absence of inflation and of brecciation are of course of\r\nthe nature of negative evidence, but they derive weight from the fact\r\nthat a great number of distinct bodies of trachyte have been examined in\r\nthe course of the investigation.\r\n\r\n3d. The inclination of the arched strata proves that they have been\r\ndisturbed. If the laccolites were formed in each case before the\r\nsediments which cover them, the strata must have been deposited with\r\nsubstantially the dips which they now possess. This is incredible. The\r\nsteepest declivity of earth-slopes upon the land is 34° from the\r\nhorizontal, and they have not been found to equal this under water.\r\nProf. J. D. Whitney noted 23° as the original slope of a deposit on the\r\nPacific Coast, and regarded it as an extreme case. The writer has made\r\nmany measurements of the inclination of oblique lamination in massive\r\nsandstones, and found the maximum to be 24°. But the strata which cover\r\nthe laccolites dip in many places 45° to 60°, and in the revetments of\r\nthe south base of Mount Hillers they attain 80°.\r\n\r\n4th. It occasionally happens that a sheet, which for a certain distance\r\nhas continued between two strata, breaks through one of them and strikes\r\nacross the bedding to some new horizon, resuming its course between\r\nother strata. Every such sheet is unquestionably _subsequent_ to the\r\nbedding.\r\n\r\n5th. The strata which overlie as well as those which underlie laccolites\r\nand sheets, are metamorphosed in the vicinity of the trachyte, and the\r\ngreatest alteration is found in the strata which are in direct contact\r\nwith it. The alteration of superior strata has the same character as the\r\nalteration of inferior. This could never be the case if the trap masses\r\nwere contemporaneous with the sediments; the strata on which they were\r\nimposed would be subjected to the heat of the lava, but the superior\r\nstrata would accumulate after the heat had been dissipated. In the Henry\r\nMountains a large number of observations were made of the phenomena at\r\nand near the contacts of sedimentary and igneous rocks, and in every\r\ninstance some alteration was found.\r\n\r\nIn fine, all the phenomena of the mountains are phenomena of intrusion.\r\nThere is no evidence whatever of extrusion. It is not indeed\r\ninconceivable that during the period in which the subterranean chambers\r\nwere opened and filled, a portion of the lava found its way to the top\r\nof the earth’s crust and there built mountains of eruption; but if such\r\never existed, they have been obliterated.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Henry Mountains are similar among themselves in constitution. They\r\nall exhibit dome-like uplifts; they all contain intrusive rocks; and\r\ntheir intrusive rocks are all of one lithologic type. They are moreover\r\nquite by themselves; the surrounding country is dissimilar in structure,\r\nand there is no gradation nor mingling of character. Thus similar and\r\nthus isolated it is natural to regard the mountains as closely related\r\nin origin, to refer their trachytes to a common source, and to look for\r\nhomology in all their parts. It was the search for such homology which\r\nled to the hypothesis that the laccolite is the dominant element of\r\ntheir structure. It is now time to examine this hypothesis, the truth of\r\nwhich has been assumed in the preceding pages, and see how far it\r\naccords with the facts of observation.\r\n\r\nThe facts to be correlated are the following:\r\n\r\n1st. There are seven laccolites which lie so far above the local plane\r\nof erosion that they are specially exposed to denuding agents. They have\r\nno enveloping strata, and their only associated sheets lie in the strata\r\nunder them. Their original forms have been impaired or destroyed by\r\nerosion. They are the Scrope, the Jukes, the Sentinel and its three\r\ncompanions, and the A laccolites.\r\n\r\n2d. There are two laccolites so nearly bared that their forms are\r\nunmistakable, but which are still partially covered by arching strata,\r\nand which have associated sheets and dikes. They are the Marvine and the\r\nSteward laccolites.\r\n\r\n3d. There are five supposed laccolites situated where the erosion planes\r\nare inclined, which run under the slopes and are covered at one side or\r\nend, and at the other project so far above them as to have lost\r\nsomething by erosion. These are accompanied by overarching strata and by\r\nsheets and dikes. They are the Peale, the Howell, the Shoulder, the D,\r\nand the E.\r\n\r\n4th. There are seven or eight supposed laccolites, of which only a small\r\npart is in each case visible, but which are outlined in form by domes of\r\noverarching strata. Their bases are not exposed. Associated with them\r\nare dikes and sheets. They are the Hillers, the Pennell, the Geikie, the\r\nNewberry, the Bowl Creek, the C, the H, and perhaps the F.\r\n\r\n5th. There are five domes of strata accompanied by dikes and (with one\r\nexception) by sheets, but showing no laccolite. They are the Ellsworth,\r\nthe Greater Holmes, the Crescent, the Jerry, and the B arches.\r\n\r\n6th. There are nine or more domes of strata with no visible\r\naccompaniment of trachyte. They are the Lesser Holmes, the Pulpit, the\r\nG, the Dana, and the Maze arches, and those of the foundation of Mount\r\nPennell and of the west base of Mount Ellen.\r\n\r\nUpon the hypothesis that all these phenomena are examples of the\r\nlaccolitic structure, they have the following explanation: Each\r\nindividual case comprised originally a laccolite, covered by a great\r\ndepth of uplifted and arching strata, and accompanied by dikes and\r\nsheets which penetrated the strata to a limited distance. Lying at\r\ndifferent depths from the surface, they have borne and still bear\r\ndifferent relations to the progressive degradation of the country, and\r\nhave been developed by erosion in different degrees. In nine of the\r\ninstances cited the arch of strata has been truncated, but at so high a\r\nlevel that no dikes nor sheets were unearthed. In five instances the\r\nplane of truncation was so low that dikes and sheets were brought to\r\nlight, but not the main body of trachyte. The truncation was in most of\r\nthese cases less perfect because of the resistance to erosion by the\r\nhard dikes and sheets and by the strata which their heat had hardened.\r\nIn eight other instances the erosion has left prominent the dome of\r\nhardened strata with its sheets and dikes, but has somewhere broken\r\nthrough it so as to reveal a massive core of trachyte. In five instances\r\none side of the dome of strata has been washed away, exposing the core\r\nof trachyte to its base and showing undisturbed strata beneath it. In\r\ntwo instances the soft matrix has been so far washed away from the\r\nlaccolite as to expose its form fully; and seven laccolites have not\r\nonly lost all cover but have themselves been partially demolished.\r\n\r\nCertainly, the hypothesis accords with all the facts that have been\r\nobserved and unites them into a consistent whole. It explains fourteen\r\ndome-like arches of sedimentary rock which are imperfectly exposed, by\r\nclassing them with seven other arches of the same region which have been\r\nopened in section _to the base_ and found to contain laccolites; and it\r\nstrengthens the case by pointing to a connected series of intermediate\r\nphenomena. Until some strata-dome of the Henry Mountains, or of a\r\nclosely allied mountain, shall be found to display some different\r\ninternal structure, it will be safe to regard the whole phenomena of the\r\ngroup as laccolitic.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Form of laccolites._—As a rule laccolites are compact in form. The\r\nbase, which in eleven localities was seen in section, was found flat,\r\nexcept where it copied the curvature of some inferior arch. Wherever the\r\nground plan could be observed it was found to be a short oval, the ratio\r\nof the two diameters not exceeding that of three to two. Where the\r\nprofile could be observed it was usually found to be a simple curve,\r\nconvex upward, but in a few cases and especially in that of the Marvine\r\nlaccolite the upper surface undulates. The height is never more than\r\none-third of the width, but is frequently much less, and the average\r\nratio of all the measurements I am able to combine is one to seven.\r\n\r\nThe ground plan approximates a circle, and the type form is probably a\r\nsolid of revolution—such as the half of an oblate spheroid.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Internal Structure._—Of the laccolites which are best exhibited in\r\nsection, there are a number which appear to be built up of distinct\r\nlayers. The Peale exhibits three layers with uneven partings of shale.\r\nThe Sentinel shows two without visible interval. The Howell shows two.\r\nThe Pennell has a banded appearance but was not closely examined. The\r\nMarvine shows at a distance a faint banding, which near by eludes the\r\neye. No division nor horizontal structure was seen in the Hillers,\r\nJukes, Scrope, or Steward laccolites, but observation was not\r\nsufficiently thorough to satisfy me of its absence. It is probable that\r\nall the larger laccolites are composite, having been built up by the\r\naccession of a number of distinct intrusions.\r\n\r\nThere is little or no prismatic structure in the trachytes. It is\r\nsometimes simulated by a vertical cleavage induced in sheets and\r\nlaccolites which are undergoing disintegration by sapping, but I did not\r\nobserve the peculiar prismatic cleavage which is produced by rapid\r\ncooling in dikes, sheets, and _coulées_ of basalt. The two structures\r\nare not often discriminated, but they are really quite distinct, and\r\ntheir peculiar characters are easily recognized. The cleavage planes\r\nproduced by cooling are as a rule perpendicular to the cooling surface,\r\nand the systems of prisms which are based on the opposite walls of a\r\ndike or sheet, do not correspond with each other, and do not run across,\r\nbut meet midway in a confused manner. The cleavage planes which are\r\nproduced by the shearing force when a massive bed of trap or other rock\r\nis undermined or sapped and yields under its own weight, extend from\r\nbase to top, and are perpendicular to the plane of the horizon instead\r\nof the plane of the bed.[2]\r\n\r\nFootnote 2:\r\n\r\n  See page 172 of the “Exploration of the Colorado River”, by J. W.\r\n  Powell.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Vertical Distribution._—The range of altitudes at which laccolites have\r\nbeen formed is not less than 4,500 feet, and neither the upper nor the\r\nlower limit is known.\r\n\r\nThe highest that are known—those which were intruded at the highest\r\ngeological horizon—are near the base of the Blue Gate shale (Middle\r\nCretaceous), but it is quite possible that higher ones have been\r\nobliterated by erosion. The lowest that is known was intruded in the\r\nShinarump shale, but it is known of the invisible Ellsworth laccolite\r\nthat upper Carboniferous strata lie above it, so that its horizon of\r\nintrusion must be still lower. The plexus of dikes and sheets on the\r\nEllsworth arch indicates that the laccolite is not deeply buried; but in\r\nthe series of arches there are nine which show no trachyte, and we have\r\nno data from which to infer their depth.\r\n\r\nHow the laccolites are distributed within these limits is more readily\r\ncomprehended by the aid of a diagram. In Figure 50 the triangles mark\r\nthe horizons of determined laccolites, and the crosses the horizons\r\nwhich the invisible laccolites cannot exceed. For example, the base of\r\nthe Scrope laccolite is visible and is seen to lie on the Tununk shale\r\n400 feet above the Henry’s Fork conglomerate; to represent it a triangle\r\nis placed at about the middle of the space representing the Tununk\r\nshale, and in the column devoted to the Ellen cluster. The upper surface\r\nof the Geikie laccolite is visible and upon it rest, first a few feet of\r\nFlaming Gorge shale, and then the Henry’s Fork conglomerate; to\r\nrepresent it a triangle is placed near the top of the Flaming Gorge\r\nspace. The crown of the Pulpit arch has been so far eroded that half of\r\nthe Vermilion Cliff sandstone is shown in section, but no laccolite is\r\nrevealed. It is evident that the Pulpit laccolite is lower than the\r\nmiddle of that sandstone; and to represent it a cross is placed below\r\nthe middle of the Vermilion Cliff space and in the column devoted to the\r\nHillers cluster.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 50.—Diagram of the Vertical Distribution of the Laccolites of the\r\n    Henry Mountains.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe first feature which this graphic assemblage yields to the eye is\r\nthat there are at least two zones of laccolites. The upper ranges from\r\nthe lower part of the Blue Gate Group, through the Tununk and Henry’s\r\nFork, to the upper part of the Flaming Gorge Group. The lower has not\r\nyet been fully developed by erosion, but its proximity is indicated. The\r\nHillers laccolite is uncovered at top, and the dikes of the Ellsworth,\r\nthe Greater Holmes, and the Crescent have been reached. All of the\r\ninvisible laccolites indicated in the Vermilion Cliff and Shinarump\r\nspaces must be referred to this zone; and there is reason to suspect\r\nthat all but one of the invisible laccolites whose indication falls in\r\nthe Tununk and Flaming Gorge spaces belong also to the lower zone.\r\nHowever this may be, it is not probable that the determination of the\r\ndepths of the invisible laccolites would vitiate the conclusion that\r\nthere is an upper zone of laccolitic frequency which is separated from a\r\nlower zone by an interspace of laccolitic infrequency.\r\n\r\nAnother feature illustrated by the diagram is that all the determined\r\nlaccolites are inclosed by soft beds. They have been intruded into the\r\nshales, but not the sandstones. They cluster about the Henry’s Fork\r\nconglomerate, but none of them divide it. This selection of matrix is\r\nconfined however to the laccolites and is not exercised by sheets and\r\ndikes. Trachyte sheets were seen within the Henry’s Fork, the Gray\r\nCliff, the Vermilion Cliff, and the Aubrey sandstones.\r\n\r\nA third feature of the diagram is the restriction of the upper zone of\r\nlaccolites to the northward clusters; Mounts Ellsworth and Holmes\r\ncontain laccolites of the lower zone only. This fact of distribution is\r\ncorrelated with a fact of denudation—namely, that in the general\r\ndegradation of the country, the region about the southern mountains has\r\nlost two thousand feet more than the northern. One fact is probably the\r\ncause of the other. The absence of laccolites of the upper zone at the\r\nsouth may have permitted the greater degradation; or the greater\r\ndegradation may have caused the destruction of several of the upper\r\nlaccolites. The fact that the difference in degradation can be\r\nindependently accounted for is favorable to the latter supposition. The\r\nColorado River which is the main artery of drainage for the whole\r\nregion, flows close to the bases of the southern mountains, and the\r\nrapid declivity from the mountain summits to the river has given and\r\nstill gives exceptionally great power to the agents of erosion. No other\r\ncause is needed to explain the difference of degradation, and the\r\nabsence of laccolites of the upper zone is explicable without assuming\r\nthat they were never present.\r\n\r\nThe negative objection to the idea that the southern mountains\r\noriginally possessed laccolites of the upper zone being thus disposed\r\nof, it is worth while to inquire whether there is any evidence in its\r\nfavor. If superior laccolites existed, they would be sure to leave\r\nbehind them a record of the conduits through which their lava was\r\ninjected. A dike or a chimney must always connect a laccolite with the\r\nsource of its material; and the removal of the laccolite necessarily\r\nexposes a cross-section of its stem. The discovery of such a dike can be\r\nregarded, not indeed as a proof of the former existence of a superior\r\nlaccolite, but as demonstrating its possibility. The summits and flanks\r\nof Mounts Holmes and Ellsworth bear many dikes, which have been regarded\r\nas subsidiary features of the laccolites beneath them, but it is quite\r\npossible that any one of them formerly led to another laccolite above.\r\nThe upper laccolite may have been first formed and then have been\r\nlifted, dike and all, when the lower was intruded; or it may have been\r\nlast formed, and been fed through a fissure which traversed the lower\r\nafter its congelation. The only dike which was discovered in the\r\nvicinity of these mountains, without being upon them, stands midway\r\nbetween them. It is the only observed dike of the Henry Mountains\r\n(excepting always the alpine district of Mount Ellen), which is not so\r\nclosely associated with some laccolite as to seem an accessory feature,\r\nand its exceptional position has led to the suspicion that it belonged\r\nto an overlying laccolite.\r\n\r\nUpon such uncertain evidence no positive conclusion can be based, and it\r\nis vain to build laccolites in the air. The most that can be said is\r\nthat the southern mountains need not be distinguished from the northern,\r\nbecause at the present stage of degradation they contain laccolites of\r\nthe lower zone only.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   _The Material of the Laccolites._\r\n\r\nThe intrusive rocks of the Henry Mountains were sampled with care.\r\nSpecimens were selected which had undergone little decomposition and\r\nwhich represented all the prominent lithologic varieties. They were\r\nchosen from the trachytes of both zones and of each of the mountain\r\nmasses; and they represent dikes and sheets, as well as laccolites. From\r\nabout thirty specimens thin slices were cut for microscopic examination.\r\n\r\nCaptain C. E. Dutton, of Omaha, Nebraska, was so kind as to undertake\r\nthe study of the collection, and the letter which embodies his\r\nconclusions is given below. In accordance with his diagnosis I shall\r\ncall the intrusive rocks _porphyritic trachyte_; and I am glad to have\r\nthe weight of his authority in support of my belief that all the rocks\r\nof the series are of one type, their resemblances far outweighing their\r\ndifferences.\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE.—Persons desiring to examine the Henry Mountain trachytes under\r\n  the microscope can obtain mounted thin sections from Mr. Alexis A.\r\n  Julien, School of Mines, Columbia College, New York.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n REPORT ON THE LITHOLOGIC CHARACTERS OF THE HENRY MOUNTAIN INTRUSIVES.\r\n\r\n                        BY CAPTAIN C. E. DUTTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n“I have examined with great interest and attention the Henry Mountain\r\nrocks you sent me, and proceed to acquaint you with such results as my\r\nlimited facilities have permitted me to derive from the examination. It\r\nis a very well defined series, having some marked characters which\r\ndistinguish it from the nearest allied group with which I am acquainted.\r\nThis is all the more interesting, because I am inclined to think that\r\nthese peculiarities may have a definable association with or relation to\r\nthe manner in which the intrusive rocks occur in those “laccolites”, as\r\nyou term them.\r\n\r\n“The hand specimens show in most cases large and unusually perfect\r\ncrystals of orthoclase imbedded in a very compact uniform paste through\r\nwhich hornblende is also disseminated rather more abundantly than is\r\nusually the case where the dominant felspar is monoclinic. Micaceous\r\ncrystals appear to be wholly wanting and this is a notable circumstance,\r\nsince the trachytes of the Plateau country, to which these rocks are\r\nmost nearly allied, are seldom without one or more of them. The only\r\nother mineral which is of frequent occurrence in the specimens is\r\nmagnetite (or possibly titanic iron), which is diffused in the usual\r\nform of minute granules in many of them, but is scarce in several of\r\nthem. In general there is a great scarcity of mineral species and any\r\nothers than those mentioned are of the greatest rarity.\r\n\r\n“The dominant felspar is orthoclase, but a portion of it is triclinic,\r\nand I presume this portion is albite, with an occasional occurrence of\r\noligoclase. The groundmass in which the crystals are included is in most\r\ncases decidedly compact and without distinguishable crystals, but shows\r\nbetween the crossed Nicols closely aggregated luminous points, which\r\nwith a ¼-inch objective are resolved indistinctly into felspar. In some\r\ncases the crystals of the groundmass are quite apparent with an inch\r\nobjective, and their species determinable. But the greater portion of\r\nthe groundmass is quite amorphous, and does not polarize light at all.\r\nThe proportion of crystalline to amorphous matter in the paste is highly\r\nvariable—in some cases it is quite bright between crossed Nicols, in\r\nothers far less so, and in none is it entirely dark. Those specimens\r\nwhich have the finer and more amorphous groundmass have the larger and\r\nmore perfect crystals of felspar—an association of properties which is\r\nnot wholly without qualification, but still sufficiently decided.\r\n\r\n“Turning to the included felspars, their mode of occurrence is quite an\r\nuncommon one, I believe, so far as the eruptive rocks of the Rocky\r\nMountain region are concerned, and give rise to some hesitation before\r\nassigning them definitely to the trachytic group. In a great many cases\r\nthe felspathic crystals are well developed, and so large and so nearly\r\nperfect that their aspect is decidedly porphyritic. This is especially\r\nthe case with the dikes of Mounts Ellsworth and Holmes (Nos. 56, 61, 68,\r\nand 69). The orthoclase is invariably of the white “milky” variety, with\r\nthe exception of a single specimen from a Mount Ellsworth dike (No. 57),\r\nwhere it is present as sanidin. (This is an exceptional rock in all\r\nrespects, and will be spoken of hereafter.) Nearly all of them appear to\r\nhave been subject to alteration by chemical action since their formation\r\nas is indicated by their diminished power to polarize light. Whether\r\nthis is due to atmospheric weathering or to changes _en masse_ it is of\r\ncourse impossible to distinguish with certainty, though I incline to the\r\nlatter view since it is manifested as decidedly in specimens which show\r\nno external indications of weathering as in those which do show them. It\r\nis not uncommon to find crystals which have almost entirely ceased to\r\npolarize. The zonal arrangement is very common in the crystals, and some\r\nof the zones contain numberless minute fluid cavities in the largest\r\ncrystals. The foreign substances included in the crystals present no\r\nnovelty, being the ordinary films of hornblende, minute needles of\r\nfelspar, granules of magnetite, and those dust-like points of brownish\r\nyellow color which are the proper inclusives of the groundmass.\r\n\r\n“The orthoclase occasionally presents the adular variety, but this never\r\nbecomes a marked feature. I have observed the same in many of the\r\ntrachytes of the High Plateaus and of the Great Basin. Another\r\nphenomenon is the occurrence of crystals which are quite typically\r\nmonoclinic at one end (orthoclase), and at the other end have the\r\narrangement of plagioclase. This is well known elsewhere, and described\r\nby Zirkel. (Mik. Beschaff der Mineralien u. Gesteine).\r\n\r\n“In classifying these rocks therefore, we may observe that they present\r\na blending of the characteristics which are common to trachyte and\r\nfelsitic porphyry. Those who regard porphyry as a distinct class of\r\neruptive rocks would have no hesitation in calling Nos. 18, 56, 61, 68,\r\nand 69 undebatable felsitic porphyries, and to the same series might\r\nwith propriety be added No. 33. With equal confidence Nos. 16, 20, 35,\r\nand 43 may be called unqualified trachytes. The other rocks are\r\nintermediate in character between these two extremes, and the whole may\r\nbe regarded as a series in which the individuals form a graduated scale.\r\n\r\n“You will recall the fact that many lithologists object to the terms\r\nporphyry or porphyritic being used to designate a distinct class or\r\ngroup of rocks, holding that they merely characterize a single feature\r\nwhich is more or less frequently presented by all igneous rocks and\r\nhaving no necessary relation to any of them, and that this is no more\r\nadequate to such an important distinction than the color or relative\r\ndegree of fineness or coarseness of texture. Although this latter view\r\nseems to me to underrate the distinctive value of the porphyritic\r\ncharacter in general, I incline very decidedly to the belief that it is\r\ntrue as applied to these Henry Mountain rocks. Here at least the\r\nporphyritic character has but little significance. In some varieties the\r\ncrystals are larger and more perfect and the groundmass more\r\nhomogeneous; in others the crystals are smaller and imperfect, and the\r\ngroundmass more coarse and irregular; while still others are ‘betwixt\r\nand between’. The most careful scrutiny fails to show any fundamental\r\ndifferences in the groundmass or in the included minerals. Hence I think\r\nthese rocks would be accurately designated _as a group_ by calling them\r\nporphyritic trachytes. Such varieties as Nos. 16, 20, and 35 may by\r\nthemselves be called simply trachyte, the porphyritic character being\r\ninsufficiently distinct in them to warrant any qualification of the\r\nname.\r\n\r\n“There is one specimen (No. 57, from dike in Shinarump shale, Mount\r\nEllsworth) which constitutes an exception to the foregoing. By\r\ninspection of a hand specimen it might hastily pass for a very compact\r\nandesite, but the observer will be instantly undeceived by applying the\r\nmicroscope. It consists of imperfect crystals, which must be sanidin,\r\nimbedded in a very close groundmass composed of a material which differs\r\nfrom the foregoing trachytes in being wholly amorphous. Between crossed\r\nNicols the paste transmits no light whatever, though between the\r\nparallel Nicols it closely resembles the others. The hand specimen is\r\nvery dark colored (gray), but the slide is sufficiently translucent. The\r\nfelspar crystals are either fragmental or very imperfectly developed as\r\nto their edges and angles, but polarize very sharply. The amount of\r\ntwinning is very small, but it appears occasionally. The rock is\r\nundoubtedly a trachyte, but an unusual one. Its dark color is not due to\r\nhornblende nor to magnetite, both of which occur in it very sparingly,\r\nespecially the former.\r\n\r\n“I have already remarked that the only frequent minerals besides felspar\r\nare hornblende and magnetite. Apatite occurs and is tolerably plentiful\r\nin a few of the specimens, but absent from most of them. The crystals\r\nare all small, requiring a low power for the determination of the larger\r\nand a high power for the smaller. They present no peculiarities. Of very\r\nrare occurrence is nepheline. This mineral is usually associated with\r\nthe more basic volcanic rocks and seldom penetrates the trachytic group.\r\nQuartz is almost equally rare. The absence of any great variety in the\r\nmineral species is quite normal, except possibly the total absence of\r\nmica, which is usually present and frequently the only associate of\r\nfelspar in the western trachytes. The Henry Mountain rocks do not so far\r\nas I can discover contain a trace of it.\r\n\r\n“In answer to your particular inquiries—\r\n\r\n“1st. ‘Is the paste vesicular, or is there any evidence in the crystals\r\nto indicate the pressure under which they were formed?’ I can only say\r\nthat the paste is extremely compact and contains no vesicles even in\r\nthose specimens of which the aspect is most decidedly trachytic. Some of\r\nthe larger crystals of felspar contain an abundance of pores or vesicles\r\nwhich may have contained liquids, but with a ¼-inch objective they are\r\ntoo small for treatment by the method you refer to. A few large\r\ncavities, usually of irregular shape, occur, but I am quite unfamiliar\r\nwith the practical treatment of this subject and cannot advise you. I do\r\nnot find any cavities still containing fluids, and I presume that even\r\nif they existed they would be difficult if not impossible to gauge on\r\naccount of the impellucidity of the felspar. I presume quartz is the\r\nmost favorable mineral for this investigation on account of its\r\ntransparency and the greater frequency of its large cavities. Quartz\r\nhowever is almost the scarcest of the contents of these rocks.\r\n\r\n“2d. ‘Do any mineralogic differences correlate with the superficial or\r\ngeographic distribution of the rocks?’ and\r\n\r\n“3d. ‘Do any mineralogic differences correlate with the vertical\r\ndistribution of the trachytes?’ As it appears from your account of the\r\ndistribution of the masses that the upper zone belongs (with one\r\nexception) to Mounts Ellen and Pennell and the lower to the other\r\nmountains, the answer to one is the answer to both, and this is in the\r\nnegative. The mineralogical differences are exceedingly small,\r\nconsidering the number of distinct masses, and this covers the inquiry\r\nentirely. Regarding the texture or habitus, on the contrary, it appears\r\nto me that the true trachytes predominate in the upper zone and the\r\nporphyries in the lower, but not without exceptions.\r\n\r\n“4th. ‘Do any mineralogic differences correlate with the size of the\r\nintrusive masses?’ No mineralogical differences thus correlate, but I\r\nfind a preponderance of the porphyritic texture in the smaller masses\r\nand of the trachytic texture in the larger. It is not without exception,\r\nand the preponderance is small.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_Metamorphism and Contact Phenomena._—Wherever the trachytes came in\r\ncontact with the sedimentaries the latter were more or less altered.\r\nLarge bodies of trachyte produced greater changes than small. The\r\nlaccolites both metamorphosed their walls more completely, and carried\r\ntheir influence to a greater distance than the sheets and dikes. The\r\nsummits of the laccolites had a greater influence than the edges; a\r\nphenomenon to which I shall have occasion to revert. The sandstones were\r\nless affected than the shales, at least in such characters as readily\r\ncatch the eye. Clay shales were indurated so as to clink under the\r\nhammer, and Captain Dutton discovered with the microscope that minute\r\ncrystals of felspar had been developed. Sandstones were usually modified\r\nin color, and their iron was segregated so as to give a mottled or\r\nspeckled appearance to the fracture. They were indurated, but the\r\ngranular texture was always retained.\r\n\r\nThe trachyte carries numerous small fragments of sedimentary rock broken\r\napparently from its walls, and these are as thoroughly crystalline as\r\ntheir matrix.\r\n\r\nThe altered rocks are usually jointed, but nothing approaching to slaty\r\ncleavage was seen, nor has there been any crumpling.\r\n\r\nThe reciprocal influence of the sandstone and shale upon the trachyte\r\nwas small. Specimens broken from the contact surface of a laccolite and\r\nfrom its interior cannot be distinguished. In the Marvine laccolite\r\nhowever there is a difference between the exterior and interior portions\r\nin their ability to withstand erosion.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Historical._—Before leaving the subject of the structure of the\r\nmountains it is proper to place on record certain observations by others\r\nwhich antedated my own but have never been published.\r\n\r\nWhile Professor Powell’s boat party was exploring the cañons of the\r\nColorado, Mr. John F. Steward a geologist and member of the party\r\nclimbed the cliff near the mouth of the Dirty Devil River and approached\r\nthe eastern base of the mountains. He reported that the strata had in\r\nthe mountains a quaquaversal dip, rising upon the flanks from all sides.\r\n\r\nThe following year Prof A. H. Thompson then as now in charge of the\r\ngeographic work of Professor Powell’s survey crossed the mountains by\r\nthe Penellen Pass and ascended some of the principal peaks. He noted the\r\nuprising of the strata about the bases and the presence of igneous\r\nrocks.\r\n\r\nIn 1873 Mr. E. E. Howell at that time the geologist of a division of the\r\nWheeler Survey traveled within twelve miles of the western base of the\r\nmountains, and observed the uprising of the strata.\r\n\r\nMy own observations were begun in 1875, at which time a week was spent\r\namong the mountains. They proved so attractive a field for investigation\r\nthat in the following year a period of nearly two mouths was devoted to\r\ntheir study.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Other Igneous Mountains._—The Henry Mountains are not the only igneous\r\ngroup which the Plateau province comprises. They are scattered here and\r\nthere throughout its whole extent. From the summits of the Henry\r\nMountains one can see the Sierra La Sal ninety miles to the\r\nnortheastward, and the Sierra Abajo seventy miles to the eastward.\r\nBeyond them and two hundred miles away are the Elk Mountains of\r\nColorado. Fifty miles to the southwestward stands the Navajo Mountain on\r\nthe brink of the Colorado; and one hundred and twenty miles to the\r\nsoutheast the Sierra La Lata and the Sierra Carriso are outlined against\r\nthe horizon. Westward it is less than thirty miles to the Aquarius\r\nPlateau, the nearest member of the great system of volcanic tables among\r\nwhich the Sevier and Dirty Devil Rivers rise.\r\n\r\nBeyond the horizon at the south and southwest and southeast are a series\r\nof extinct volcanoes; Mount Taylor and the Marcou Buttes in New Mexico;\r\nthe Sierra Blanca, the Sierra Mogollon, the San Francisco Group and the\r\nUinkarets in Arizona; and the Panguitch Lake Buttes in Utah.\r\n\r\nOf the groups which are visible, all but that of the Aquarius Plateau\r\nare allied in character to the Henry Mountains.\r\n\r\nThe Sierra Abajo was studied in 1859 by Dr. J. S. Newberry, geologist of\r\nthe Macomb Expedition, who writes: “Within the last few weeks we have\r\nbeen on three sides of this sierra, and have learned its structure quite\r\ndefinitely. It is a mountain group of no great elevation, its highest\r\npoint rising some 2,000 feet above the Sage-plain, or perhaps 9,000 feet\r\nabove the sea. It is composed of several distinct ranges, of which the\r\nmost westerly one is quite detached from the others. All these ranges,\r\nof which there are apparently four, have a trend of about 25° east of\r\nnorth, but being arranged somewhat _en echelon_, the most westerly range\r\nreaching farthest north, the principal axis of the group has a northwest\r\nand southeast direction. The sierra is composed geologically of an\r\nerupted nucleus, mainly a gray or bluish-white trachyte, sometimes\r\nbecoming a porphyry, surrounded by the upheaved, partially eroded,\r\nsedimentary rocks. The Lower Cretaceous sandstones and Middle Cretaceous\r\nshales are cut and exposed in all the ravines leading down from it,\r\nwhile nearly the entire thickness of the Cretaceous series is shown in\r\nspurs which, in some localities, project from its sides; apparently the\r\nremnants of a plateau corresponding to, and once connected with, the\r\nMesa Verde. Whether the Paleozoic rocks are anywhere exposed upon the\r\nflanks of the Sierra Abajo I cannot certainly say, though we discovered\r\nno traces of them. It is, however, probable that they will be found in\r\nsome of the deeper ravines, where, as in most of these isolated\r\nmountains composed mainly of erupted material, they are doubtless but\r\nlittle disturbed, but are buried beneath the ejected matter which has\r\nbeen thrown up through them.\r\n\r\n“The relations of the Cretaceous rocks to the igneous nucleus of the\r\nSierra Abajo are very peculiar, for, although we did not make the entire\r\ncircuit of the mountain mass, and I can, therefore, not speak definitely\r\nin regard to the western side, as far as our observations extended we\r\nfound the sedimentary strata rising on to the trachyte core, as though\r\nit had been pushed up through them.” (Geology of the Macomb Expedition,\r\npage 100.)\r\n\r\nOf another group Dr. Newberry says in the same report (page 93): “Of the\r\ncomposition of the Sierra La Sal we know nothing except what was taught\r\nby the drifted materials brought down in the cañons through which the\r\ndrainage from it flows. Of this transported material we saw but little,\r\nbut that consisted mainly of trachytes and porphyry, indicating that it\r\nis composed of erupted rocks similar to those which form the Sierra\r\nAbajo, of which it is in fact almost an exact counterpart. From the\r\ncliffs over Ojo Verde we could see the strata composing both the upper\r\nand second plateaus, rising from the east, south, and southwest on to\r\nthe base of the Sierra La Sal, each conspicuous stratum being distinctly\r\ntraceable in the walls of the cañons and valleys which head in the\r\nsierra. It is evident, therefore, that the rocks composing the Colorado\r\nPlateau are there locally upheaved, precisely as around the Sierra\r\nAbajo * * *.”\r\n\r\nThese mountain groups have been since visited by the geologists of Dr.\r\nHayden’s survey, Dr. A. C. Peale ascending the Sierra La Sal and Mr. W.\r\nH. Holmes the Sierra Abajo. Mr. Holmes has also examined the La Lata and\r\nCarriso Mountains and found in them the same upbending of Cretaceous\r\nstrata and the same association of igneous material.\r\n\r\nThe Navajo Mountain has been viewed by Mr. Howell and by the writer from\r\na commanding position on the opposite side of the Colorado River, and\r\nfragments of its trachyte have been gathered on the river bank by\r\nProfessor Powell, but no geologist has yet climbed it. Still there can\r\nbe no question of its general structure. It is a simple dome of\r\nJura-Triassic sandstone, springing abruptly from a plateau of the same\r\nmaterial, and veined at the surface by sheets and dikes of trachyte—the\r\ncounterpart in fine of Mount Ellsworth, only of more imposing\r\nproportions.\r\n\r\nThe La Sal, the Abajo, the La Lata, the Carriso, the Navajo, and the\r\nHenry Mountains agree in their essential features. Structurally they\r\nhave no trends. Their phenomena are grouped about centers and not axes.\r\nIn all of them the strata are lifted into dome-like arches, and\r\nassociated with these arches are bodies of trachyte. The trachytes are\r\nall of one lithologic type, and are so closely related that a collection\r\nof rock specimens representing all the groups would show scarcely more\r\nvariety than a collection representing the Henry Mountain laccolites.\r\nWith so many characters in common they can hardly fail to agree in the\r\npossession of laccolitic nuclei.[3]\r\n\r\nFootnote 3:\r\n\r\n  While these pages are passing through the press a paper by Dr. A. C.\r\n  Peale “On a peculiar type of eruptive mountains in Colorado” (Bulletin\r\n  U. S. Geol. Sur., Vol. III, No. 3) comes to hand. He groups together\r\n  as of one type not only the Elk, La Sal, Abajo, La Lata, and Carriso\r\n  Mountains, but also the Spanish Peaks, Park View Mountain, Mount\r\n  Guyot, Silverheels Mountain, the San Miguel Mountains, the La Plata\r\n  Mountains, and certain smaller masses in Middle Park and near the\r\n  Huerfano River. He says, “Although modified in several instances, the\r\n  general plan appears to be the same. The igneous material came up\r\n  through fissures in the sedimentaries, sometimes tipping up their\r\n  ends, and sometimes passing through without disturbing them. On\r\n  reaching the Cretaceous shales, it generally spread out in them, and\r\n  pushed into and across them dikes and intrusive sheets of the same\r\n  igneous rock. The elevation in some cases appears to be due to actual\r\n  upheaval caused by the eruptive force. The mountains as they now exist\r\n  are doubtless largely the result of erosion, the hard igneous rock\r\n  opposing greater resistance to erosive influences than do the\r\n  surrounding soft sedimentary beds.”\r\n\r\nThe Elk Mountains are at the very margin of the plateau, and\r\ngeographically might be connected with the Sawatch Range which bounds\r\nthe plateau province on that side. But structurally they are a group\r\ninstead of a range, and affiliate with the groups which are insulated by\r\nan environment of tables. Thanks to the labors of Mr. Holmes and Dr.\r\nPeale their general structure is known. The Eastern Elk Mountains\r\nconsist of four great bodies of “eruptive granite”, over which are\r\narched not only Mesozoic but Paleozoic strata. Their foundation must be\r\na floor of Archæan metamorphics. Two of them, the Snow Mass and White\r\nRock laccolites, are joined by a continuous line of disturbance, in the\r\ndescription of which by pen and pencil Mr. Holmes has made an important\r\ncontribution, not only to dynamical geology, but to the methods of\r\ngeological illustration. The others are more symmetric and are\r\ncomplementary illustrations of the common structure. One, the Sopris, is\r\nhalf truncated by erosion so that the core is exposed at top with an\r\nencircling fringe of upturned sedimentaries; and the other, the\r\nTreasury, retains a complete arch of Paleozoic strata. The Western Elk\r\nMountains are a cluster of smaller laccolites which are inserted between\r\nstrata of Cretaceous age. Their traps include porphyritic trachytes\r\nundistinguishable from those of the Henry Mountains, and eruptive\r\ngranites identical with those of the Eastern Elk Mountains; and they\r\nexhibit a gradation from one to the other. Indeed the two rocks are\r\nnearly related, and their assignment to classes so diverse as trachyte\r\nand granite is merely an illustration of the imperfection of our\r\nclassification of rocks. The description of the Elk Mountains will be\r\nfound on pages 61 to 71 and 163 to 168 of the Annual Report for 1874 of\r\nthe “Geological and Geographical Survey of the Territories.”\r\n\r\nIf we turn now to the distinctively volcanic mountains of the Plateau\r\nprovince—to those which are built by eruption at the surface—we leave at\r\nonce the porphyritic trachytes. Mount San Francisco, Mount Bill\r\nWilliams, Mount Sitgreaves, Mount Kendrick, Mount Floyd and the Sierra\r\nBlanca (of Arizona) are all composed of basic trachytes, and so are the\r\nAquarius Plateau and the many tables that lie beyond it.\r\n\r\nThe Mogollon group, the Marcou Buttes, the minor cones about Mount San\r\nFrancisco, the Uinkarets, and the Panguitch Lake group are basaltic. In\r\neach of these instances the igneous rock issued above the surface and\r\nthere is no evidence by displacement that any portion of it was\r\ndeposited below.\r\n\r\nMount Taylor may be an exception. In the character of its lava and its\r\ngeneral features it resembles Mount San Francisco, but there are\r\ndisturbed strata on its southern flank, and it is possible the mountain\r\nis both extrusive and intrusive. Extrusion and intrusion are probably\r\ncombined in some small tables lying fifty miles north of the Henry\r\nMountains. They are built of Flaming Gorge shale, preserved from erosion\r\nby dikes, sheets, and (probably) outflows of basalt.\r\n\r\nCombining all these facts we attain to a simple relation between two\r\ntypes of igneous rock on the one hand, and two types of mountain\r\nstructure on the other. One type of rock is acidic, including\r\n“porphyritic trachyte” and “eruptive granite”, and its occurrence is\r\nwithout exception intrusive. The other type of rock is basic, including\r\nbasic trachyte and basalt, and its occurrence is almost uniformly\r\nextrusive.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible to combine the two groups of phenomena by saying that\r\nin one case the eruptive cones cover laccolites, and in the other the\r\nlaccolites have been covered by eruptive cones which have disappeared;\r\nfirst, because many of the eruptive cones are too well exposed to admit\r\nof the concealment of laccolitic arches beneath them; second, because\r\nthe two types of lava are essentially different. The acidic type if\r\nextruded at the surface would be an ordinary trachyte; the basic type if\r\ncrystallized under pressure would be classed with the greenstones.\r\n\r\nThe basis for the generalization is exceedingly broad. I have enumerated\r\nonly seven groups of laccolitic mountains and ten groups of eruptive;\r\nbut with few exceptions each group is composed of many individuals, each\r\none of which is entitled to rank as a separate phenomenon. In the\r\nUinkaret Mountains Professor Powell has distinguished no less than one\r\nhundred and eighteen eruptive cones, and in the Henry Mountains I have\r\nenumerated thirty-six individual laccolites. In one locality basic lava\r\nhas one hundred and eighteen times risen to the surface by channels more\r\nor less distinct, instead of opening chambers for itself below. In the\r\nother locality porphyritic trachyte has thirty-six times built\r\nlaccolites instead of rising to the surface.\r\n\r\nIf our attention was restricted to these two localities we might as\r\nnaturally correlate the types of structure with some accidents of\r\nlocality as with types of lava; but when all the localities are taken\r\ninto account it is evident that there is no common mark by which either\r\nthe laccolitic or the volcanic are distinguished.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE QUESTION OF CAUSE.\r\n\r\nWe are now ready to consider the question: Why is it that in some cases\r\nigneous rocks form volcanoes and in other cases laccolites?\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to broach the more difficult problem of the source\r\nof volcanic energy. We may assume that molten rock is being forced\r\nupward through the upper portion of the earth’s crust, and disregarding\r\nits source and its propelling force may restrict our inquiry to the\r\ncircumstances which determine its stopping place.\r\n\r\nLet us further assume, but for a moment only, that the cohesion of the\r\nsolid rocks of the crust does not impede the upward progress of the\r\nfluid rock, nor prevent it from spreading laterally at any level. The\r\nlava will then obey strictly the general law of hydrostatics, and assume\r\nthe station which will give the lowest possible position to the center\r\nof gravity of the strata and lava combined.\r\n\r\n(1) If the fluid rock is less dense than the solid, it will pass through\r\nit to the surface and build a subaërial mountain.\r\n\r\n(2) If the upper portion of the solid rock is less dense than the fluid,\r\nwhile the lower portion is more dense, the fluid will not rise to the\r\nsurface but will pass between the heavy and light solids and lift or\r\nfloat the latter.\r\n\r\n(3) If the crust be composed of many horizontal beds of diverse and\r\nalternating density, the fluid will select for its resting place a level\r\nso conditioned that no superior group of successive beds, including the\r\nbed immediately above it, shall have a greater mean specific gravity\r\nthan its (the fluid’s) own; and that no inferior group of successive\r\nbeds, including the bed immediately beneath, shall have a less mean\r\nspecific gravity than its own.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 51.—Diagram to illustrate the application of the law of\r\n    Hydrostatic Equilibrium to the movements of lavas. The shaded bands\r\n    represent heavy strata; the open, light.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[In the diagram, a series of light and heavy beds are represented in\r\nsection by open and shaded spaces. A lava stream free to move upward or\r\nlaterally will intrude itself at some point (_c_) so placed that every\r\ncombination of superior beds (_a_), which includes the lowest, shall\r\nhave a less average density; and every combination of inferior strata\r\n(_b_), which includes the highest, shall have a greater average density\r\nthan that of the lava.]\r\n\r\nThe first case is that of a volcano; the second is that of a laccolite;\r\nand the third is the general case, including the others and applying to\r\nall volcanoes and laccolites.\r\n\r\nConversely we may say that, given a series of strata of diverse and\r\nalternating density, a very light lava will traverse it to the top and\r\nbe extruded; a heavier will intrude itself at some lower level; and a\r\nseries of dissimilar lavas may select an equal number of distinct\r\nlevels.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to imagine such a balancing of conditions that a slight\r\nchange in a lava will determine a great change in its level of\r\nintrusion.\r\n\r\nHaving seen the general application of the hydrostatic law, it is time\r\nto recall the condition which we laid aside at the start. Cohesion, or\r\nrigidity, is never absent and must affect every phase of vulcanism. It\r\ncertainly opposes the free circulation of lavas, and it cannot but\r\nmodify their obedience to the hydrostatic law.\r\n\r\nBut granting this, and believing that a full comprehension of the\r\nsubject must include this condition, I am at a loss to tell in what way\r\nit influences the selection by a lava flood of a subaërial or a\r\nsubterranean bourne. Whether it will on the whole oppose upward progress\r\nmore than lateral, or _vice versa_, is not clear. If it resists lateral\r\nintrusion the more strongly, it favors the formation of volcanoes; if it\r\nresists upward penetration the more strongly, it favors the formation of\r\nlaccolites; and in either case the working of the hydrostatic law is\r\nmodified.\r\n\r\nBut in neither case is the working of the law more than modified. The\r\nlaw is not abrogated, and in obedience to it light lavas still _tend_ to\r\nrise higher than heavy however much the rising of all lavas may be\r\nhindered or favored.\r\n\r\nIn brief, since lavas are fluids they are subject to the law of fluid\r\nequilibrium, and their behavior is conditioned by the relations of their\r\ndensities to the densities of the solids which they penetrate; and since\r\nthe latter solids are rigid and coherent, it is further conditioned by\r\nthe resistance which is opposed to their penetration. When the\r\nresistance to penetration is the same in all directions, the relation of\r\ndensities determines the stopping place of the rising lava; but when the\r\nvertical and lateral resistances are unequal, _their_ relation may be\r\nthe determining condition.\r\n\r\nIf we can decide whether the determinative condition in the Plateau\r\nregion was that of densities or that of penetrability, we shall have\r\nsolved our problem.\r\n\r\nAssuming, first, that the essential condition is that of penetrability,\r\nwe should expect that some particular stratum or that a few particular\r\nstrata, being less penetrable than others, would check the rising lavas\r\nand accumulate them in a system of laccolites, which would occupy one,\r\nor a few definite horizons. Volcanoes would occur in districts from\r\nwhich such impenetrable strata either were originally absent or had been\r\nremoved before the igneous epoch; and we should expect to find the same\r\nvariety of material in laccolites and in volcanoes.\r\n\r\nAssuming, second, that the essential condition is that of densities, we\r\nshould expect as before to find certain stratigraphic horizons more\r\nfavorable than others to the accumulation of laccolites, and we should\r\nalso expect to find certain lavas usually volcanic and certain others\r\nusually laccolitic.\r\n\r\nThat is to say—since the condition of impenetrability resides in the\r\nsolid rock only, and the condition of density pertains to both solid and\r\nfluid, either condition might determine laccolites at certain\r\nstratigraphic horizons, while the latter only could discriminate certain\r\nlavas as intrusive and others as extrusive.\r\n\r\nThe vertical distribution of laccolites is not inconsistent with either\r\nassumption. In the Henry Mountains there are two zones of occurrence; in\r\nthe Eastern Elk Mountains there is a third; and it is probable in the\r\npresent state of our knowledge that all other laccolites of the Plateaus\r\ncan be assigned to one or another of these. The fact that the laccolites\r\nof the upper zone have a vertical range of two thousand feet is rather\r\nfavorable to the idea that their stations were determined by relations\r\nof density, but is not decisive.\r\n\r\nWhen however we turn to the relation between the constitutions and the\r\nbehaviors of lavas, we find the entire weight of the evidence in favor\r\nof the assumption that conditions of density determine the structure.\r\nThe coincidence of the laccolitic structure with a certain type of\r\nigneous rock is so persistent that we cannot doubt that the rock\r\ncontained in itself a condition which determined its behavior.\r\n\r\nWe are then led to conclude that the conditions which determined the\r\nresults of igneous activity were the relative densities of the intruding\r\nlavas and of the invaded strata; and that the fulfillment of the general\r\nlaw of hydrostatics was not materially modified by the rigidity and\r\ncohesion of the strata.\r\n\r\nHaving reached this conclusion it is natural to seek for confirmation by\r\nthe investigation of the densities of the rocks concerned in the\r\nphenomena. As will appear by a table given further on, the density of\r\nthe Henry Mountain trachyte has been determined to be 2.61.; but the\r\ndensities of the erupted lavas of the Plateaus are not yet known. There\r\ncan be no doubt however that the latter are heavier. Von Cotta in his\r\nLithology gives 2.9 to 3.1 as the density of basalt, and 2.6 to 2.9 as\r\nthe density of the more basic trachytes. And in general, it is well\r\nestablished that where the state of aggregation is the same, basic\r\nigneous rocks are always heavier than acidic. But in order that the\r\nlaccolitic structure should have been determined by density, the acidic\r\nrock of the laccolites must have been heavier in its _molten_ condition\r\nthan the more basic rocks of the neighboring volcanoes; and since in the\r\n_crystalline_ condition the acidic is the lighter, it follows that it\r\nhas gained less density in cooling than the basic.\r\n\r\nIf the amount of contraction of the several rocks in passing from their\r\nnatural molten condition to the crystalline condition could be\r\ndetermined experimentally, a crucial test would be applied to our\r\nconclusions as to the origin of laccolites. The matter is however beset\r\nwith difficulties. Bischof attempted by melting eruptive rocks in clay\r\ncrucibles to obtain their ratios of expansion and contraction, but his\r\nmethod involved so many sources of error that his results have been\r\ngenerally distrusted. He concluded that the contraction in passing from\r\nthe molten to the crystalline state is greater in acidic than in basic\r\nrocks. Delesse by an extended series of experiments in which crystalline\r\nrocks were melted and afterward cooled to glasses, showed that acidic\r\nrocks increase in volume from 9 to 11 per cent. in passing from the\r\ncrystalline state to the vitreous, while basic increase only 6 to 9 per\r\ncent. Mallet concluded from some experiments of his own that the\r\ncontraction of rocks in cooling from the molten condition is never more\r\nthan 6 per cent., and that it is greater with basic than with acidic\r\nrocks; but considering that the substances which he treated were\r\nartificial and not natural products, that his methods were not uniform,\r\nand that he ignored the distinction between the vitreous and the\r\ncrystalline, of which Delesse had demonstrated the importance, no weight\r\ncan be given to his results.\r\n\r\nIf however all of these experiments were trustworthy and their results\r\nwere concordant, their bearing upon the problem of the laccolites would\r\nstill be slight. It is generally conceded that the fusion of lavas is\r\nhydrothermal, while in all the experiments recourse was had to dry\r\nfusion; and the densities attained in the two ways are necessarily\r\ndifferent. The practical difficulty in the way of restoring the natural\r\nmolten condition is great and may be insuperable, but unless it shall be\r\novercome we cannot learn experimentally the changes of density which\r\nigneous rocks undergo in congelation.\r\n\r\nThere is a fact of observation which tends to sustain the view that the\r\nlaccolitic rocks contracted less in cooling than the volcanic. The\r\nprismatic structure is produced by the contraction of cooling rocks\r\nduring and after solidification. That it does not occur in the Henry\r\nMountain trachytes indicates that their contraction was small. That it\r\ndoes occur at numerous localities in Utah in basalts, indicates that\r\ntheir contraction was relatively great. Mr. Jukes, in his Manual of\r\nGeology, says that it is most frequently exhibited in “doleritic lavas\r\nand traps, being especially characteristic of basalt, but occurs almost\r\nas perfectly in some greenstones and felstones”; and in the range of my\r\nown observation I can recall no instance of its occurrence in other than\r\nbasic rocks.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the sake of comparing the densities of the intrusive rocks with\r\nthose of the strata which contain them, a number of determinations were\r\nmade of the specific gravities of specimens representative of the\r\ntrachytes and of the several sedimentary groups of the Henry Mountains.\r\n\r\nTrachytes were selected to represent as great a variety of locality and\r\nrelation as possible, and at the same time exclude all specimens which\r\nshowed traces of decomposition. Hand specimens weighing from one hundred\r\nto four hundred grains were used, and these were weighed first dry, and\r\nthen suspended in water. By using such large quantities averages were\r\nobtained of a rock which, minutely considered, is heterogeneous; and by\r\nusing the blocks entire instead of pulverized or granulated, the state\r\nof aggregation of its minerals was included as an element of the\r\nspecific gravity of the rock.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that the range, 2.54 to 2.66, is very small.\r\n\r\n  _Table of Specific Gravities of Trachytes of the Henry Mountains._\r\n ───────────────────────────────────────────────────┬─────────────────\r\n                      Locality.                     │Specific gravity.\r\n ───────────────────────────────────────────────────┼─────────────────\r\n East flank of Mount Pennell; sheet                 │             2.66\r\n Marvine Laccolite; north base of Mount Ellen       │             2.65\r\n Peale Laccolite; east flank of Mount Ellen         │             2.64\r\n Dike on Mount Ellsworth                            │             2.64\r\n South base of Mount Hillers; sheet                 │             2.63\r\n Sheet under the Peale Laccolite                    │             2.62\r\n Scrope Laccolite; southeast base of Mount Ellen    │             2.60\r\n Bowl Creek Laccolite; northeast base of Mount Ellen│             2.58\r\n North spur of Mount Pennell; dike                  │             2.58\r\n Sentinel Laccolite; north base of Mount Pennell    │             2.54\r\n                                                    │             ————\r\n                        Mean                        │             2.61\r\n ───────────────────────────────────────────────────┴─────────────────\r\n\r\nSpecimens to represent the stratigraphic series were selected at the\r\n_margins_ of the disturbed region so far as possible, to avoid the\r\neffect of metamorphism.

In order to restore so far as practicable the\r\ncondition of the rocks at the time of the lavic intrusion, the specimens\r\nwere saturated with water, and in this condition were weighed in air as\r\nwell as in water.

The Blue Gate shale which\r\n_unaltered_ gave 2.45, is lithologically identical with the Tununk shale\r\nwhich _altered_ gave 2.69. The Aubrey sandstone cannot be observed\r\nunaltered in the vicinity of the mountains, but at a distance of forty\r\nmiles where it again comes to the surface it closely resembles the Gray\r\nCliff sandstone. If it has the same normal weight as the latter, then it\r\nhas increased from 2.13 to 2.55.\r\n\r\nThe specimens of the Vermilion Cliff sandstone numbered 6 and 7 were not\r\nvisibly changed, but as they were obtained from the flank of the Holmes\r\narch there was reason to suspect that their condition was not normal,\r\nand the determined densities strengthen the suspicion. Judged by other\r\nlocalities, the normal density of the Vermilion Cliff rock is not far\r\nfrom that of the Gray Cliff rock, namely 2.13; and it is easy to believe\r\nthat the upper portion of the bed where it lay on the side of the Holmes\r\narch was changed in density to 2.21; while the lower portion lying\r\nnearer the laccolite was changed to 2.28; and while the same bed among\r\nthe Ellsworth dikes acquired the density of 2.48.\r\n\r\nTaking into account both these considerations and certain others which\r\nneed not be enumerated, I derive the following:\r\n\r\n             _Table of the Specific Gravities of the Henry\r\n              Mountain Sedimentary series in the Order of\r\n                            Superposition._\r\n         ───────────────────────────────────┬─────────────────\r\n                   Bed.                     │Specific gravity.\r\n         ───────────────────────────────────┼─────────────────\r\n         Masuk Sandstone                    │             2.16\r\n         Masuk Shale               estimated│             2.40\r\n         Blue Gate Sandstone                │             2.14\r\n         Blue Gate Shale                    │             2.45\r\n         Tununk Sandstone                   │             2.15\r\n         Tununk Shale              estimated│             2.45\r\n         Henry’s Fork Conglomerate          │             2.25\r\n         Flaming Gorge Shale                │             2.42\r\n         Gray Cliff Sandstone               │             2.13\r\n         Vermilion Cliff Sandstone estimated│             2.15\r\n         Shinarump Shale           estimated│             2.40\r\n         Aubrey Sandstone          estimated│             2.15\r\n         ───────────────────────────────────┴─────────────────\r\n\r\nTaking into account the thicknesses of the several beds enumerated in\r\nthe foregoing table, it is easy to obtain the mean specific gravity of\r\nall which lie above a given horizon; and by making this determination\r\nfor the horizon of the base of each of the indicated beds, the following\r\ntable has been derived. The figures are based on the assumption that the\r\nrock series included nothing above the Masuk sandstone. If (as is\r\nprobable) there were Tertiary beds also, the estimates are too low, for\r\nthe Tertiaries of the vicinity are calcareous and argillaceous and\r\nconsequently dense.\r\n\r\n           _Table showing the Mean Specific Gravities of the\r\n          Rock Series contained between certain horizons and\r\n                  the summit of the Masuk Sandstone._\r\n          ─────────────────────────────────┬─────────────────\r\n                      Horizons.            │    Specific\r\n                                           │   gravities.\r\n          ─────────────────────────────────┼─────────────────\r\n          Base of Masuk Sandstone          │             2.16\r\n          Base of Masuk Shale              │             2.28\r\n          Base of Blue Gate Sandstone      │             2.23\r\n          Base of Blue Gate Shale          │             2.32\r\n          Base of Tununk Sandstone         │             2.31\r\n          Base of Tununk Shale             │             2.34\r\n          Base of Henry’s Fork Conglomerate│             2.33\r\n          Base of Flaming Gorge Shale      │             2.36\r\n          Base of Gray Cliff Sandstone     │             2.33\r\n          Base of Vermilion Cliff Sandstone│             2.32\r\n          Base of Shinarump Shale          │             2.33\r\n          ─────────────────────────────────┴─────────────────\r\n\r\nFrom this it appears that the laccolites of the upper zone, extending\r\nfrom the lower part of the Blue Gate Shale to the upper part of the\r\nFlaming Gorge Shale, bore loads of which the mean densities were from\r\n2.31 to 2.34, and that laccolites of the lower zone, which has its upper\r\nlimit in the Shinarump Shale, bore loads of which the mean densities\r\nwere 2.32 and upward. If the positions of the laccolites were determined\r\npurely by the law of hydrostatic equilibrium, then these figures define\r\nthe density of the molten trachyte, and show that its contraction in\r\ncooling—from the density 2.34 to the density 2.61—was about one-tenth of\r\nits volume.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE STRETCHING OF STRATA.\r\n\r\nIt has been the opinion, not only of the writer but of other students of\r\nthe displacements of the West, that the ordinary sedimentary rocks,\r\nsandstone, limestone, and shale, are frequently _elongated_ as well as\r\ncompressed by orographic movements, and that this takes place without\r\nany appreciable metamorphism; but it is difficult to find opportunity\r\nfor the demonstration of the phenomenon by measurement. When a fold is\r\nmade in a level stratum, either of two things may take place; the\r\nportions of the stratum which remain level at the sides may approach\r\neach other; or the stratum may be stretched. But when a circular portion\r\nof a continuous level stratum is lifted into a quaquaversal arch (as\r\nillustrated in Figure 11), an approach of the level portions is out of\r\nthe question, and there must be a stretching or a fracture. Of the\r\nunfractured quaquaversals of the Henry Mountains there is one which\r\ncombines all the essentials of a crucial case. The Lesser Holmes arch is\r\nnearly isolated; on three sides it rises from the undisturbed plateau,\r\nand on the fourth it joins a similar but fractured dome. The major part\r\nof its surface is composed of one bed, the Vermilion Cliff sandstone,\r\nbroken only by erosion. Comparing the length of this bed in its present\r\ncurved form with the space it must have occupied before it was upbent, I\r\nfind that in a distance of three miles it has been elongated three\r\nhundred feet. Moreover there is every reason to suppose that the\r\nelongation was produced quickly, or at least by a succession of finite\r\nrather than infinitesimal increments; for the lifting of the arch was\r\ncaused by the intrusion of a laccolite, and though the latter may have\r\nbeen built by the addition of many separate lava flows, it could not\r\nhave risen with secular and continuous slowness. The molten trachyte,\r\nrising through a passage and into a reservoir that were comparatively\r\ncool, would have clogged itself by congelation had it not moved with a\r\ncertain degree of rapidity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 52.—Cross-section of an uplifted dome. The dotted lines show the\r\n    original position of a bed; the curved lines, the imposed.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe condition which rendered possible the elongation and the sudden\r\nbending of so rigid and brittle a rock as a massive sandstone, was\r\npressure. At the time of the uplift the sandstone was buried by other\r\nsediments to a depth of from five thousand to eight thousand feet, and\r\nsustained a pressure of from five thousand to eight thousand pounds to\r\nthe square inch. Now the experiments which have been made upon building\r\nstones show that the weight required to crush similar sandstones in a\r\ndry condition, is three thousand to five thousand pounds to the inch;\r\nand it is a fact familiar to quarrymen that sandstone and limestone\r\nwhich are quarried below the water level are both softer and weaker\r\nwhile they are still saturated than they are after drying. So we may\r\nfairly assume that the Vermilion sandstone was loaded at the time of its\r\ndisplacement with a crushing weight. No part could yield to the pressure\r\nwhile it was sustained by the surrounding parts; but every part was\r\nready to yield whenever its support was withdrawn. It was in a\r\nquasi-plastic state and abhorred a fissure as strongly as “nature abhors\r\na vacuum”, and for the same reason. A fissure could not be opened in it\r\nunless it was coincidently filled by something—such as lava—which would\r\nresist the tendency of its walls to flow together. The formation of a\r\ngaping fissure being thus prevented, and the uplifting of the dome\r\nrequiring that the sandstone should cover a greater area, an extension\r\nof the bed was the necessary result. It was not _stretched_ into the\r\ndome form; it was _compressed_. The efficient force did not act in the\r\ndirection of the extension, but vertically. The sandstone was pushed,\r\nnot pulled.\r\n\r\nIf this explanation is the true one, then it is true in general that\r\njust as for each rock there is a crushing weight, so there is for each\r\nrock a certain depth at which it cannot be fissured and can be flexed.\r\nThe softer rocks are plastic at small depths. Fire-clays under coal\r\nseams exude, or “creep”, even with the pressure of a few feet of\r\nsuperincumbent strata. Springs of water rise at the outcroppings of soft\r\nstrata because the joints which intersect most rocks near the surface of\r\nthe ground cannot cross those which are soft enough to yield under the\r\npressure incident to them. If the soft beds were jointed they would not\r\nintercept percolating water, and the distribution of springs would be\r\nvery different.\r\n\r\nThe phenomena of fissure veins are in point. When a fault takes place,\r\nand one rock mass is slidden past another to which it had been joined it\r\nis usually the case that the opposed surfaces no longer fit together as\r\nthey did before the movement, and interspaces are left. These become\r\nfilled, at first by water, and afterward by minerals deposited from the\r\nwater, and the mineral masses thus deposited are called fissure veins.\r\nBut the preservation of the interspaces depends upon the rigidity of the\r\nrocks which inclose them; and it frequently happens that where a system\r\nof rocks is traversed by a fault, the harder will keep somewhat apart\r\nand maintain a fissure, while the softer will be crushed together\r\nwithout an interspace. If the mineral vein which forms in such a fissure\r\nis afterward explored in mining, it is found to be traceable and\r\ncontinuous so far as it is walled by the hard rock upon both sides, but\r\nwhen the hard is replaced by the soft in one or both walls, the vein is\r\neither reduced to a mere fillet or disappears completely. If the fault\r\nextends to a great depth, it will finally reach a region where the\r\nhardest rocks which it separates are coerced by so great a pressure that\r\nthey cannot hold themselves asunder, but are forced together before the\r\nfissure can be filled by mineral deposits. Thus there is a definable\r\ninferior limit to the region of vein formation; and even while it is\r\nimpossible to assign a downward limit to the fault which made place for\r\na vein, it may be possible to assign a downward limit to the vein\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nAccordant with this view is the absence of fissure veins from the Henry\r\nMountains. Displacement and thermal disturbance are usually regarded as\r\nthe conditions of mineral concentration; and here were displacement and\r\nlavic intrusion coincident in time and place. The heat which\r\nmetamorphosed great bodies of shale and sandstone was surely competent\r\nto excite the currents and reactions which concentrate minerals in\r\nveins; but the displacements did not open fissures, and the heated water\r\ncould circulate only through the pores of rocks. Fissure veins were\r\nimpossible, and the sluggish currents which were engendered in\r\ncontinuous rock masses did not effect a great change in the distribution\r\nof minerals.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    THE CONDITIONS OF ROCK FLEXURE.\r\n\r\nThere are three known conditions under which strata of the most rigid\r\ncharacter may be bent without fracture; or in other words there are\r\nthree ways in which flexibility may be either induced or demonstrated.\r\nAt ordinary temperatures and at the surface of the earth a hard stratum\r\ncannot be quickly flexed. But no rigidity is absolute, and a constant\r\nstrain, even though slight, will in the course of time produce\r\ndeformation. The same result may be accomplished quickly if the\r\ntemperature of the stratum is raised to near the point of fusion. Or it\r\nmay be accomplished with neither great heat nor great time if only the\r\nstratum is so deeply buried that the weight of its cover keeps it from\r\nopening fissures. The three conditions of flexure are time, heat, and\r\npressure; and whenever the circumstances of a displacement include none\r\nof these, the rocks are broken. A fourth condition, moisture, is of\r\ngreat importance as an accessory, but alone it is not sufficient to\r\nprevent fracture. The whole body of strata of the earth’s crust is\r\nsaturated with water, except a very little at the surface, and all rock\r\nmovements are thereby facilitated. If the strata were dry, their flexure\r\nwould require much more time, or heat, or pressure, than is necessary in\r\ntheir moist condition.\r\n\r\nOften the three conditions complement each other; but not always.\r\n\r\nWe may say, the greater the load which strata bear the more rapidly they\r\ncan be flexed; and conversely, the more slowly strata are displaced the\r\nless the pressure necessary to prevent fracture.\r\n\r\nAnd we may say, the higher the temperature of strata the more rapidly\r\nthey can be flexed; and conversely, the more slowly strata are displaced\r\nthe lower the temperature necessary to prevent fracture.\r\n\r\nFor both these statements we find support in a great series of\r\nhomologies. But we cannot affirm that such a reciprocal relation exists\r\nbetween the effects of heat and pressure. For all rocks are believed to\r\nexpand by heating, up to the point of fusion; and it is a recognized\r\nphysical law that in all bodies which heat expands, the effects of heat\r\nare opposed by pressure. Hence we cannot say, “The heavier the load\r\nwhich strata bear the lower the temperature necessary to prevent\r\nfracture”, nor can we say, “The higher the temperature of strata the\r\nless the load necessary to prevent fracture”.\r\n\r\n\r\n             THE QUESTION OF COVER AND THE QUESTION OF AGE.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the laccolites of the Henry Mountains were formed\r\nbeneath the surface of the earth’s crust, but at what depth is not so\r\nevident. The problem is involved with the problem of the age of the\r\nlaccolites, and the two are connected with the general history of the\r\nBasin of the Colorado. Neither problem can be called, for the present at\r\nleast, determinate, but it is possible to narrow them down by the\r\nindication of limits which their solutions will not exceed.\r\n\r\nSo much of the Colorado Plateau region as lies within Colorado and Utah\r\nwas covered during a geological age which it is convenient to call\r\nCretaceous, by a sea, the waters of which appear to have become fresh\r\ntoward the last. Then came elevation both general and differential. A\r\ngreat part of the sea bed became dry land, and the accumulated sediments\r\ntogether with many which underlay them were bent into great waves\r\nthousands of feet in altitude. The crests of the waves were subjected to\r\nerosion and truncated. Then came a second submergence which was purely\r\nlacustrine. In some way that has not been ascertained a lake basin was\r\nformed, and the region received a new system of sediments which it is\r\nconvenient to call Tertiary, and which not merely filled the troughs\r\nbetween the great rock-waves but covered the truncated summits of the\r\nwaves themselves. Then followed the desiccation of the basin by the\r\ncutting down of its rim where the water overflowed. The overflowing\r\nriver as it deepened its channel and gradually lowered the lake,\r\nsteadily extended its upper course to follow the receding shore; and\r\nfinally when the basin was completely drained the river remained, its\r\nchannel leading through what had been the deepest part of the Tertiary\r\nsea. That river is the Colorado. As portions of the lake bottom were\r\nsuccessively drained they began at once to be eroded, and from that time\r\nto this there has been progressive degradation. The regions nearest to\r\nthe central river were reduced most rapidly and have been completely\r\nstripped of their Tertiary strata, but broad areas of the latter remain\r\nat the west, and north, and east.\r\n\r\n(The reader will understand that this succinct history is shorn for the\r\nsake of clearness of all details and qualifications. There have been\r\ncomplicating eruptions and displacements or oscillations at every stage,\r\nand if the full story could be told, it would not be by a single\r\nparagraph nor by a single chapter.)\r\n\r\nWhen the Cretaceous strata were thrown into waves the site of the Henry\r\nMountains remained in a trough, and it probably was not dried, but\r\ncontinued the scene of sedimentation while the crests of the surrounding\r\nrock-waves were worn away. Certainly it was not greatly eroded at that\r\ntime; and when the Tertiary lake beds were thrown down it was favorably\r\ndisposed for a heavy deposit. It is not extravagant to assume that four\r\nthousand feet of lake beds rested on the Masuk sandstone at the\r\nbeginning of the final desiccation.\r\n\r\nIn brief there may be distinguished—\r\n\r\n  1. The deposition of the Cretaceous.\r\n\r\n  2. The folding and erosion of the Cretaceous.\r\n\r\n  3. The deposition of the Tertiary.\r\n\r\n  4. The desiccation of the Tertiary lake basin.\r\n\r\n  5. The erosion which is still in progress.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the laccolites were not formed until the Cretaceous\r\nstrata had been deposited; for their uplifts have bent and tilted all\r\nCretaceous rocks up to and including the Masuk sandstone.\r\n\r\nThey were not formed at any late stage of the final erosion, for they\r\nconserve tables along their western base, which but for their shelter\r\nwould long since have disappeared. From the end of the Cretaceous period\r\nto the end of the desiccation of the basin there is no event with which\r\nthe laccolites can be directly connected. There is however a\r\nconsideration which in an indirect way sanctions the opinion that the\r\nepoch of igneous activity was after the deposition of the Tertiaries and\r\nbefore their erosion.\r\n\r\nThe Masuk Sandstone is at once the summit of the Cretaceous and the\r\nhighest bed in the present Henry Mountain section. If it were restored\r\nover the entire range, the laccolites of the upper zone would have on\r\nthe average thirty-five hundred feet of cover, and those of the lower\r\nzone nearly seven thousand feet. This was the depth of their original\r\ncover, if they were intruded at the close of the Cretaceous age. During\r\nthe epoch of Tertiary deposition and the subsequent epoch of erosion,\r\nthe cover first increased in depth and then diminished, having its\r\nmaximum at the end of the Tertiary deposition. If it can be shown that\r\nthe original cover of the upper laccolites exceeded thirty-five hundred\r\nfeet, the question of age will be reduced to comparatively narrow\r\nlimits. In order to discuss the problem of the original depth of cover\r\nit will be necessary to consider another matter, of which the connection\r\nwill not at first be apparent.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The size of laccolites._—It is a matter worthy of note that no\r\nlaccolite of inconsiderable extent is known in the Henry Mountains. The\r\nsmallest which has been measured is more than half a mile in diameter,\r\nand the largest about four miles. The phenomenon does not occur upon a\r\nsmall scale, but has a definite inferior limit to its magnitude. Let us\r\nseek an explanation of this limit.\r\n\r\nThe dome of strata which covers a laccolite has for its profile on every\r\nside a monoclinal curve. In Figure 52 the section of a dome exhibits a\r\nmonoclinal flexure in _s a_ and again in _s b_; and the dome being\r\napproximately circular this flexure completely surrounds it. We may even\r\ndescribe or define the dome as a monoclinal flexure encircling a point\r\nor a space. Considering now that when the laccolite was injected the\r\noverlying strata were lifted, and that this disturbance was communicated\r\nupward to the then existing surface of the earth, we may properly speak\r\nof the lifted body of rock as a cylinder bounded on every side by a\r\nmonoclinal flexure. Furthermore, since the monoclinal flexure is the\r\nstructural equivalent of the fault[4], we may render our conception\r\nstill simpler by replacing in imagination the encircling flexure by an\r\nencircling fault, and picturing to ourselves the uplifted rock mass as a\r\nsimple cylinder, perfectly divided from the surrounding rock and slidden\r\nupward so as to project above the surface an amount equal to the depth\r\nof the laccolite.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4:\r\n\r\n  Exploration of the Colorado, pp. 182–184. Explorations West of the\r\n  100th Meridian, Vol. III, p. 48. American Journal of Science, July,\r\n  1876, p. 21.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to give a mathematical expression to the force necessary\r\nto produce such a circular fault. Disregarding lithologic differences,\r\nthe resistance to the rupture is measured by the area of the faulted\r\nsurface, or what is the same thing, the area of the convex surface of\r\nthe cylinder. Representing the resistance to be overcome by _r_, the\r\nheight of the cylinder (equal to the depth of the cover of the\r\nlaccolite) by _d_, and its circumference by _c_, we have\r\n\r\n                         _r_ = _dcC_      (1),\r\n\r\nin which _C_ is a function of the cohesion of the material and is\r\nconstant.\r\n\r\nThe force by which the cylinder is lifted and by which it is assumed\r\nthat the faulting is accomplished, is communicated through the molten\r\nlava of the forming laccolite. Being thus communicated it is applied\r\nequally to all parts of the base of the cylinder, and its efficient\r\ntotal is measured by the area of that base. A part of it is devoted to\r\nlifting the weight of the cylinder, and the remainder is devoted to the\r\nmaking of the fault. Each of these parts is proportioned, like the\r\nwhole, to the area of the base of the cylinder, or to the area of the\r\nlaccolite. Representing the portion applied to the faulting by _f_, and\r\nthe area of the laccolite by _a_, we have\r\n\r\n                            _f_ = _a C_{l}_\r\n\r\nin which _C_{l}_, is a constant, and a function of the pressure under\r\nwhich the lava is injected.\r\n\r\nSubstituting for _a_ its equivalent, _c_^²⁄₄π\r\n\r\n                          _f_ = _c^2 C_{l}_/4π\r\n\r\nand substituting _C_{ll}_ for the constant term _C_{l}_/4π\r\n\r\n                      _f_ = _c^2 C_{ll}_       (2)\r\n\r\nEquation 1 gives an expression for the resistance which cohesion can\r\noppose to the uplift of the cylinder. Equation 2 gives an expression for\r\nthe force exerted by the fluid laccolite toward overcoming the\r\nresistance of cohesion. It is evident that for a given value of _d_ it\r\nis possible to assign a value of _C_ so large that _f_ will be greater\r\nthan _r_, or so small that _f_ will be less than _r_. That is to say, at\r\na given depth beneath the surface a laccolite of a certain circumference\r\nwill be able to force upward the superjacent cylinder of rock, while a\r\nlaccolite of a certain smaller circumference will be unable to lift its\r\ncover. Or in other words, there is a limit in size beneath which a\r\nlaccolite cannot be formed.\r\n\r\nWhen a lava forced upward through the strata reaches the level at which\r\nunder the law of hydrostatic equilibrium it must stop, we may conceive\r\nthat it expands along some plane of bedding in a thin sheet, until its\r\nhorizontal extent becomes so great that it overcomes the resistance\r\noffered by the rigidity of its cover, and it begins to uplift it. The\r\ndirection of least resistance is now upward, and the reservoir of lava\r\nincreases in depth instead of width. The area of a laccolite thus tends\r\nto remain at its minimum limit, and may be regarded as more or less\r\nperfectly an index of that limit.\r\n\r\nIn equations 1 and 2, if _f_ = _r_, then\r\n\r\n                        _c_^2 _C_{ll}_ = _d c C_\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n                    _c_ = _d_(_C_/_C_{ll}_)      (3)\r\n\r\nThat is to say, if the force exerted by the lava is barely sufficient to\r\novercome the resistance to uplift, then the circumference of the\r\nlaccolite is proportional to the depth of its cover. Or in other words,\r\nthe (linear) size of a laccolite is proportioned to its depth beneath\r\nthe surface.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf now we return from the faulted cylinder which for simplicity’s sake\r\nhas been hypothecated, to the actual cylinder which is surrounded by a\r\nflexure instead of a fault, can we retain our conclusions? With certain\r\nmodifications I think we can. The strains developed in deformation by\r\nflexure are less easy of analysis than those which arise in faulting,\r\nbut the two cases are in some degree analogous.\r\n\r\nThe expression (equation 2) for the force which the lava applies to\r\ndeformation is unaffected by the manner in which the strata yield.\r\n\r\nThe expression (equation 1) for the resistance to deformation by\r\nfaulting involves two terms, each in its simplest relations; the\r\nresistance varies directly as the circumference of the laccolite, and it\r\nvaries directly as the depth of the cover. In order to pass to an\r\nexpression for the resistance to deformation by flexure, only one of\r\nthese terms need be changed. The resistance bears the same relation to\r\nthe circumference of the laccolite; but it is no longer simply\r\nproportional to the depth of the cover. It varies more rapidly.\r\n\r\nIf the covering strata were all of a given thickness, were identical in\r\nkind, and were free to slide upon each other without friction, their\r\ntotal resistance to deformation would be equal to the resistance of a\r\nsingle stratum multiplied by the number of strata. But since they are\r\nnot free to slide one upon another, they sustain each other, and the\r\nresistance offered by the combination is greater than that product.\r\n\r\nI am led by the analogy of allied problems in mechanics to assume that\r\nthe resistance of the body of strata varies with some power of its\r\ndepth, but I am unable to say _what_ power. So far as I am aware,\r\nneither mathematical analysis nor experimentation has been directed to\r\nthe problem in question. According to Rankine “the resistances of\r\nflexure of similar cross-sections [of elastic beams] are as their\r\nbreadths and as the _squares_ of their depths” (“Applied Mechanics”,\r\npage 316), and it is possible that the same law applies to the\r\nresistances which continuous strata oppose to the uplifts of domes. But\r\nit appears more probable that the greater complexity of the strains\r\ndeveloped in the formation of domes causes the depth to enter into the\r\nformula with a higher power than the second.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, some allowance should be made for the fact that the\r\nelasticity of the resisting strata is imperfect.\r\n\r\nIf we call the power with which the depth enters the formula a, equation\r\n1 becomes\r\n\r\n                  _r_ = _d^a_ _c_ _C_{lll}_      (4).\r\n\r\nand equation 3 becomes\r\n\r\n               _c_ = _d^a_ (_C_{lll}_/_C_{ll}_)      (5).\r\n\r\nIt is probable that the true value of _a_ is not less than 2, nor more\r\nthan 3.\r\n\r\nInterpreting these equations in the same manner as those applying to\r\ndeformation by faulting, we reach the following conclusions:\r\n\r\n1st. At a given depth beneath the surface, lava injected under a given\r\npressure cannot form a laccolite of less than a certain area. This may\r\nbe called its _limital area_.\r\n\r\n2d. The pressure of injection remaining constant, the limital area of a\r\nlaccolite is a direct function of its depth beneath the surface. The\r\nlimital area is greater when the depth is greater, and less when the\r\ndepth is less.\r\n\r\n3d. A laccolite of small volume will not exceed the limital area, but\r\nwill grow by lifting its cover. If however the volume of intruded lava\r\nbe great, its own weight becomes a factor in the equilibrium of forces\r\nand modifies the distribution of the pressures. As the rock bubble\r\nrises, the weight of the contained fluid is progressively subtracted\r\nfrom the pressure against its top, and this proceeds until the upward\r\nand lateral pressures become proportional to the resistances which\r\nseverally oppose them. Further expansion is then both upward and\r\noutward.\r\n\r\n4th. There is a limit to upward expansion, dependent on the fact that\r\nthe pressure due to the combined weight of the laccolite and cover\r\ncannot exceed the pressure of the intrusive lava. Regarding the\r\nintrusive pressure as constant, it is divisible into three parts, of\r\nwhich one sustains the weight of the cover, also constant; another\r\nsustains the weight of the fluid laccolite, and is measured by its\r\nthickness or depth; and the third produces deformation. When the sum of\r\nthe weights of the cover and laccolite equals the total pressure of the\r\nintrusive lava, uplift ceases, and the maximum depth or thickness is\r\nattained. We may call this the _limital thickness_. With regard to\r\nsimple laccolites the limit is absolute, but it applies only to the\r\ndistinct layers of those which are composite; for a composite laccolite,\r\nbuilt by successive intrusions at wide intervals of time, may be\r\nrelieved of part of its load by the erosion of the mound which its\r\nexpansion causes at the surface of the land.\r\n\r\nA laccolite formed beneath the bottom of a sea has a greater limital\r\nthickness than one formed beneath a land surface; for the superjacent\r\nwater being displaced and thrust aside, is to that extent subtracted\r\nfrom the load to be lifted.\r\n\r\n5th. The laccolite in its formation is constantly solving a problem of\r\n“least force”, and its form is the result. Below, above, and on all\r\nsides its expansion is resisted, and where the resistance is greatest\r\nits contour is least convex. The floor of its chamber is unyielding, and\r\nthe bottom of the laccolite is flat. The roof and walls alike yield\r\nreluctantly to the pressure, but the weight of the lava diminishes its\r\npressure on the roof. Hence the top of the laccolite becomes broadly\r\nconvex, and its edges acutely. Local accidents excepted, the walls\r\noppose an equal resistance on every side; and the base of the laccolite\r\nis rendered circular.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second of the conclusions enunciated above is susceptible of test by\r\nobservation. By selecting those laccolites of which the dimensions are\r\nknown with the best degree of approximation, the following table has\r\nbeen formed:\r\n\r\n            │    Formations.    │Titles of Laccolites.│Diameters│Means.\r\n            │                   │                     │in miles.│\r\n\r\n ───────────┬───────────────────┬─────────────────────┬─────────┬───┬───\r\n Upper Zone │Blue Gate Shale    │Sentinel             │       .7│ .7│1.2\r\n ───────────┼───────────────────┼─────────────────────┼─────────┼───┼───\r\n      „     │Tununk Shale       │Geikie               │       .8│1.2│ „\r\n      „     │         „         │A                    │       .9│ „ │ „\r\n      „     │         „         │Marvine              │      1.0│ „ │ „\r\n      „     │         „         │Jukes                │      1.4│ „ │ „\r\n      „     │         „         │Peale                │      1.8│ „ │ „\r\n ───────────┼───────────────────┼─────────────────────┼─────────┼───┼───\r\n      „     │Flaming Gorge Shale│Steward              │      1.0│1.4│ „\r\n      „     │         „         │B                    │      1.1│ „ │ „\r\n      „     │         „         │Newberry             │      1.8│ „ │ „\r\n      „     │         „         │C                    │      1.9│ „ │ „\r\n ───────────┴───────────────────┼─────────────────────┼─────────┼───┼───\r\n Lower Zone                     │Dana                 │      2.0│   │2.6\r\n                „               │Greater Holmes       │      2.1│   │ „\r\n                „               │Lesser Holmes        │      2.1│   │ „\r\n                „               │Ellsworth            │      2.3│   │ „\r\n                „               │Pulpit               │      2.3│   │ „\r\n                „               │Maze                 │      2.8│   │ „\r\n                „               │Crescent             │      3.6│   │ „\r\n                „               │Hillers              │      3.9│   │ „\r\n\r\nThere is no laccolite of the upper zone so large as the smallest in the\r\nlower zone; and the mean diameter of those in the lower zone is double\r\nthe mean of those in the upper.

There is no room to doubt that a relation exists\r\nbetween the diameters of laccolites and the depths of their intrusion.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving determined by observation the mean size of the laccolites in the\r\nupper and lower zones, as well as the interval which separates the two\r\nzones, and knowing approximately the law which binds the size of the\r\nlaccolite to its depth of intrusion, we can compute the depth of\r\nintrusion of each zone. Our result will doubtless have a large probable\r\nerror, but it will not be entirely without value.\r\n\r\nLet _x_ represent the thickness in feet of the original cover of the\r\nlaccolites of the upper zone; and _x_ + 3300 the thickness of the cover\r\nof the laccolites of the lower zone. The mean circumference in feet of\r\nthe upper laccolites is 1.2 π × 5280 = 6336 π. The mean circumference of\r\nthe lower laccolites is 2.6 π × 5280 = 13728 π. Substituting these\r\nvalues in equation 5, we obtain\r\n\r\n                   6336 π = _x^a_(_C_{lll}_/_C_{ll}_)\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n             13728 π = (_x_ + 3300)_^a_(_C_{lll}_/_C_{ll}_)\r\n\r\nDividing the second equation by the first and reducing, 3300\r\n\r\n                _x_ = 3300/ª√(¹³⁷²⁸⁄₆₃₃₆ − 1)      (6).\r\n\r\nTo obtain a minimum result, assume a = 2; then\r\n\r\n               _x_ = 3300/√(¹³⁷²⁸⁄₆₃₃₆ − 1) = 7000 feet,\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n                        _x_ + 3300 = 10300 feet.\r\n\r\nThe summit of the Masuk sandstone is 3,500 feet above the mean level of\r\nthe upper laccolites; subtracting this from the value of _x_ gives 3,500\r\nfeet as the depth of Tertiary strata which overlay the Masuk beds during\r\nthe epoch of laccolitic intrusion.\r\n\r\nTo obtain a maximum result, assume _a_ = 3; then\r\n\r\n               _x_ = 3300/∛(¹³⁷²⁸⁄₆₃₃₆ − 1) = 11200 feet,\r\n\r\n               _x_ + 3300 = 14500 feet,\r\n\r\nand the result for the depth of the Tertiary strata is 7,700 feet.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am far from attaching great weight to this speculation in regard to\r\nthe original depths of the laccolite covers. It is always hazardous to\r\nattempt the quantitative discussion of geological problems, for the\r\nreason that the conditions are apt to be both complex and imperfectly\r\nknown; and in this case an uncertainty attaches to the law of relation,\r\nas well as to the quantities to which it is applied. Nevertheless after\r\nmaking every allowance there remains a presumption that the cover of the\r\nlaccolites included some thousands of feet of Tertiary sediments.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat evidence we have then, indicates that the epoch of laccolitic\r\nintrusion was after the accumulation of deep Tertiary deposits and\r\nbefore the subsequent degradation had made great progress—that it was at\r\nor near the close of the epoch of local Tertiary sedimentation.\r\n\r\nIf the reader would realize the relation between the eroded material and\r\nthe surviving mountains, let him turn to the Frontispiece. A perspective\r\nview is there given of a tract ten miles square, with Mount Ellsworth in\r\nthe center. It is represented as cut out from all surroundings by\r\nvertical planes which descend to the level of the ocean. The southern or\r\nnearer half of the block shows the present aspect of the country; the\r\nremote half shows the form it is supposed to have had if the uplift was\r\ncompleted before the erosion began, or what is the same thing, the form\r\nit would have, had there been no erosion. The difference between the two\r\nrepresents the total amount of the material that has been washed away\r\nsince the completion of the Tertiary sediments.\r\n\r\n\r\nPartly in review, let us now sketch the\r\n\r\n\r\n                       HISTORY OF THE LACCOLITE.\r\n\r\nWhen lavas forced upward from lower-lying reservoirs reach the zone in\r\nwhich there is the least hydrostatic resistance to their accumulation,\r\nthey cease to rise. If this zone is at the top of the earth’s crust they\r\nbuild volcanoes; if it is beneath, they build laccolites. Light lavas\r\nare more apt to produce volcanoes; heavy, laccolites. The porphyritic\r\ntrachytes of the Plateau Province produced laccolites.\r\n\r\nThe station of the laccolite being decided, the first step in its\r\nformation is the intrusion along a parting of strata, of a thin sheet of\r\nlava, which spreads until it has an area adequate, on the principle of\r\nthe hydrostatic press, to the deformation of the covering strata. The\r\nspreading sheet always extends itself in the direction of least\r\nresistance, and if the resistances are equal on all sides, takes a\r\ncircular form. So soon as the lava can uparch the strata it does so, and\r\nthe sheet becomes a laccolite. With the continued addition of lava the\r\nlaccolite grows in height and width, until finally the supply of\r\nmaterial or the propelling force so far diminishes that the lava clogs\r\nby congelation in its conduit and the inflow stops. An irruption is then\r\ncomplete, and the progress of the laccolite is comparable with that of a\r\nvolcano at the end of its first eruption. During the irruption and after\r\nits completion, there is an interchange of temperatures. The laccolite\r\ncools and solidifies; its walls are heated and metamorphosed. At the\r\nedges, where the surface of the laccolite is most convex, the heat is\r\nmost rapidly dissipated, and its effect in metamorphism is least. A\r\nsecond irruption may take place either before or after the first is\r\nsolidified. It may intrude above or it may intrude beneath it; and\r\nobservation has not yet distinguished the one case from the other. In\r\nany case it carries forward the deformation of cover that was begun by\r\nthe first, and combines with it in such way that the compound form is\r\nsymmetric, and is substantially the same that would have been produced\r\nif the two irruptions were combined in one. Thus the laccolite grows by\r\nsuccessive accretions until at length its cooled mass, heavier and\r\nstronger than the surrounding rocks, proves a sufficient obstacle to\r\nintrusion. The next irruption then avoids it, opens a new conduit, and\r\nbuilds a new laccolite at its side. By successive shiftings of the\r\nconduit a group of laccolites is formed, just as by the shifting of\r\nvents eruptive cones are grouped. Each laccolite is a subterranean\r\nvolcano.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 53.—Diagram to illustrate the relation of Dikes and Sheets to the\r\n    Strains which are developed in the uplifting of laccolitic arches.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe strata above the laccolite are bent instead of broken, because their\r\nmaterial is subjected to so great a pressure by superincumbent strata\r\nthat it cannot hold an open fissure and is _quasi-plastic_. But although\r\nquasi-plastic it is none the less solid, and can be cracked open if the\r\ngap is instantaneously filled, the cracking and the filling being one\r\nevent. This happens in the immediate walls of the laccolite, and they\r\nare injected by dikes and sheets of the lava. The directions of the\r\ncracks are normal to the directions of the extensive strains (strains\r\ntending to extend) where they occur. From the top of the laccolite dikes\r\nrun upward into the roof, marking horizontal strains (_a a_). From the\r\nsides smaller vertical dikes run outward, marking horizontal, tangential\r\nstrains. And parallel to the sides near the base of the laccolite, are\r\nnumerous sheets, marking strains directed outward and upward (_c c_).\r\nThese last especially serve to show that the rigidity of the strata is\r\nnot abolished, although it is overpowered, by the pressure which warps\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nHere we are brought face to face with a great fact of dynamic geology\r\nwhich though well known is too often ignored. The solid crust of the\r\nearth, and the solid earth if it be solid, are as plastic _in great\r\nmasses_ as wax is in small. Solidity is not absolute but relative. It is\r\nonly a low grade of plasticity. The rigidity or strength of a body is\r\nmeasured by the square of its linear dimensions, while its weight is\r\nmeasured by the cube. Hence with increase in magnitude, the weight\r\nincreases more rapidly than the strength; and no very large body is\r\nstrong enough to withstand the pressure of its own weight. However solid\r\nit may be, it must succumb and be flattened. When we speak of rock\r\nmasses which are measured by feet, we may regard them as solid; but when\r\nwe consider masses which are measured by miles, we should regard them as\r\nplastic.\r\n\r\nThe same principle is illustrated by the limital area of laccolites. A\r\nsmall laccolite cannot lift its small cover, but a large laccolite can\r\nlift its correspondingly large cover. The strength or rigidity which\r\nresists deformation is overcome by magnitude.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Laccolites of Other Regions._—In many lands geologists have observed\r\nintrusive rocks occurring in great bodies, but I am not aware that such\r\na system as that of the Henry Mountains has ever been described.\r\nDoubtless all such bodies are laccolitic, but the combination of\r\nconditions which this field presents can rarely be repeated. In the\r\nfirst place the strata which here contain the laccolites lay level. They\r\nhad suffered no displacement before the epoch of irruption, and they\r\nhave suffered none since. The laccolitic phenomena stand by themselves,\r\nwith nothing to mar their symmetry or complicate their study. In the\r\nnext place the laccolites are here assembled in such number and with\r\nsuch variety of size, form, and horizon that there is little danger of\r\nmistaking accidental features for essential. Again, the region having\r\nbeen recently elevated is the scene of rapid degradation. Waterways are\r\ndeeply corraded, slopes are steep, and escarpments abound. And finally\r\nthe climate is so arid that vegetation is exceedingly scant. The rocks\r\nare for the most part bare and their examination is unobstructed.\r\n\r\nIf the conditions of erosion and climate had been unfavorable in the\r\nHenry Mountains, they could not have yielded the key to the laccolitic\r\nstructure; but the key once found, it is to be anticipated that the\r\nstructure will be recognized in other laccolites of which the exposures\r\nare less perfect.\r\n\r\nIf the strata had experienced anterior displacements so as to be\r\ninclined, folded, and faulted, a symmetrical growth of laccolites would\r\nhave been impossible, and the mountains would not have yielded a\r\nknowledge of the type form. But the type form being known, it is to be\r\nanticipated that in disturbed regions aberrant forms will be recognized\r\nand referred to the type.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Possible Analogues of the Laccolite._—All the arches of the Henry\r\nMountains have been ascribed to laccolites, whether their nuclei were\r\nvisible or concealed, and the evidence upon which the latter were\r\nincluded appears to admit of no controversy. The question arises whether\r\nthe great flexures of the Plateau region may not be allied in structure.\r\nThe volcano having its homologue in the laccolite, may not broad lava\r\nfields have their homologues beneath displacements of the Kaibab type?\r\n\r\nThe idea is naturally attractive to one who has made a special study of\r\nlaccolites, but it is hardly tenable. There are indeed many points of\r\nresemblance between such flexures as the Waterpocket, and the uplifts of\r\nthe Henry Mountains; but the points of contrast are equally conspicuous,\r\nand seem to mark a radical difference.\r\n\r\nThere is a certain symmetry of form which is characteristic of the\r\nlaccolitic arches, but which is rarely seen in the great flexures. And\r\nthere is a linear element which is characteristic of the latter, but not\r\nof the former. The great flexures always have direction or trend, and\r\noften exhibit parallelism; the laccolitic arches betray no trend either\r\nindividually or collectively.\r\n\r\nThese features are well shown in Plate II, where the Waterpocket flexure\r\nis contrasted with the Henry Mountain arches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V.\r\n                            LAND SCULPTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Basin of the Colorado offers peculiar facilities for the study of\r\nthe origin of topographic forms, and its marvelous sculpture has excited\r\nthe interest of every observer. It has already made notable\r\ncontributions to the principles of earth sculpture[5], and its resources\r\nare far from exhausted. The study of the Henry Mountains has not proved\r\nentirely unfruitful, and for the sake of showing the bearing of its\r\npeculiar features upon the general subject, I shall take the liberty to\r\nrestate certain principles of erosion which have been derived or\r\nenforced by the study of the Colorado Plateaus.\r\n\r\nFootnote 5:\r\n\r\n  Geology of the “Colorado Exploring Expedition”, by J.

The last mentioned agencies only will be here discussed.\r\n\r\nThe erosion which they accomplish will be considered (A) as consisting\r\nof parts, and (B) as modified by conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        A. PROCESSES OF EROSION.\r\n\r\nAll indurated rocks and most earths are bound together by a force of\r\ncohesion which must be overcome before they can be divided and removed.\r\nThe natural processes by which the division and removal are accomplished\r\nmake up erosion. They are called disintegration and transportation.\r\n\r\nTransportation is chiefly performed by running water.\r\n\r\nDisintegration is naturally divided into two parts. So much of it as is\r\naccomplished by running water is called corrasion, and that which is\r\nnot, is called weathering.\r\n\r\nStated in their natural order, the three general divisions of the\r\nprocess of erosion are (1) _weathering_, (2) _transportation_, and (3)\r\n_corrasion_. The rocks of the general surface of the land are\r\ndisintegrated by _weathering_. The material thus loosened is\r\n_transported_ by streams to the ocean or other receptacle. In transit it\r\nhelps to _corrade_ from the channels of the streams other material,\r\nwhich joins with it to be transported to the same goal.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             _Weathering._\r\n\r\nIn weathering the chief agents of disintegration are solution, change of\r\ntemperature, the beating of rain, gravity, and vegetation.\r\n\r\nThe great solvent of rocks is water, but it receives aid from some other\r\nsubstances of which it becomes the vehicle. These substances are chiefly\r\nproducts of the formation and decomposition of vegetable tissues. Some\r\nrocks are disintegrated by their complete solution, but the great\r\nmajority are divided into grains by the solution of a portion; and\r\nfragmental rocks usually lose by solution the cement merely, and are\r\nthus reduced to their original incoherent condition.\r\n\r\nThe most rigid rocks are cracked by sudden changes of temperature; and\r\nthe crevices thus begun are opened by the freezing of the water within\r\nthem. The coherence of the more porous rocks is impaired and often\r\ndestroyed by the same expansive force of freezing water.\r\n\r\nThe beating of the rain overcomes the feeble coherence of earths, and\r\nassists solution and frost by detaching the particles which they have\r\npartially loosened.\r\n\r\nWhen the base of a cliff is eroded so as to remove or diminish the\r\nsupport of the upper part, the rock thus deprived of support is broken\r\noff in blocks by gravity. The process of which this is a part is called\r\ncliff erosion or _sapping_.\r\n\r\nPlants often pry apart rocks by the growth of their roots, but their\r\nchief aid to erosion is by increasing the solvent power of percolating\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nIn general soft rocks weather more rapidly than hard.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           _Transportation._\r\n\r\nA portion of the water of rains flows over the surface and is quickly\r\ngathered into streams. A second portion is absorbed by the earth or rock\r\non which it falls, and after a slow underground circulation reissues in\r\nsprings. Both transport the products of weathering, the latter carrying\r\ndissolved minerals and the former chiefly undissolved.\r\n\r\nTransportation is also performed by the direct action of gravity. In\r\nsapping, the blocks which are detached by gravity are by the same agency\r\ncarried to the base of the cliff.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              _Corrasion._\r\n\r\nIn corrasion the agents of disintegration are solution and mechanical\r\nwear. Wherever the two are combined, the superior efficiency of the\r\nlatter is evident; and in all fields of rapid corrasion the part played\r\nby solution is so small that it may be disregarded.\r\n\r\nThe mechanical wear of streams is performed by the aid of hard mineral\r\nfragments which are carried along by the current. The effective force is\r\nthat of the current; the tools are mud, sand, and bowlders. The most\r\nimportant of them is sand; it is chiefly by the impact and friction of\r\ngrains of sand that the rocky beds of streams are disintegrated.\r\n\r\nStreams of clear water corrade their beds by solution. Muddy streams act\r\npartly by solution, but chiefly by attrition.\r\n\r\nStreams transport the combined products of corrasion and weathering. A\r\npart of the _débris_ is carried in solution, and a part mechanically.\r\nThe finest of the undissolved detritus is held in suspension; the\r\ncoarsest is rolled along the bottom; and there is a gradation between\r\nthe two modes. There is a constant comminution of all the material as it\r\nmoves, and the work of transportation is thereby accelerated. Bowlders\r\nand pebbles, while they wear the stream bed by pounding and rubbing, are\r\nworn still more rapidly themselves. Sand grains are worn and broken by\r\nthe continued jostling, and their fragments join the suspended mud.\r\nFinally the detritus is all more or less dissolved by the water, the\r\nfinest the most rapidly.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn brief, weathering is performed by solution; by change of temperature,\r\nincluding frost; by rain beating; by gravity; and by vegetation.\r\nTransportation is performed chiefly by running water. Corrasion is\r\nperformed by solution, and by mechanical wear.\r\n\r\nCorrasion is distinguished from weathering chiefly by including\r\nmechanical wear among its agencies, and the importance of the\r\ndistinction will be apparent when we come to consider how greatly and\r\npeculiarly this process is affected by modifying conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   B. CONDITIONS CONTROLLING EROSION.\r\n\r\nThe chief conditions which affect the rapidity of erosion are (1)\r\ndeclivity, (2) character of rock, and (3) climate.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    _Rate of Erosion and Declivity._\r\n\r\nIn general _erosion is most rapid where the slope is steepest_; but\r\nweathering, transportation, and corrasion are affected in different ways\r\nand in different degrees.\r\n\r\nWith increase of slope goes increase in the velocity of running water,\r\nand with that goes increase in its power to transport undissolved\r\ndetritus.\r\n\r\nThe ability of a stream to corrade by solution is not notably enhanced\r\nby great velocity; but its ability to corrade by mechanical wear keeps\r\npace with its ability to transport, or may even increase more rapidly.\r\nFor not only does the bottom receive more blows in proportion as the\r\nquantity of transient detritus increases, but the blows acquire greater\r\nforce from the accelerated current, and from the greater size of the\r\nmoving fragments. It is necessary however to distinguish the ability to\r\ncorrade from the rate of corrasion, which will be seen further on to\r\ndepend largely on other conditions.\r\n\r\nWeathering is not directly influenced by slope, but it is reached\r\nindirectly through transportation. Solution and frost, the chief agents\r\nof rock decay, are both retarded by the excessive accumulation of\r\ndisintegrated rock. Frost action ceases altogether at a few feet below\r\nthe surface, and solution gradually decreases as the zone of its\r\nactivity descends and the circulation on which it depends becomes more\r\nsluggish. Hence the rapid removal of the products of weathering\r\nstimulates its action, and especially that portion of its action which\r\ndepends upon frost. If however the power of transportation is so great\r\nas to remove completely the products of weathering, the work of\r\ndisintegration is thereby checked; for the soil which weathering tends\r\nto accumulate is a reservoir to catch rain as it reaches the earth and\r\nstore it up for the work of solution and frost, instead of letting it\r\nrun off at once unused.\r\n\r\nSapping is directly favored by great declivity.\r\n\r\nIn brief, a steep declivity favors transportation and thereby favors\r\ncorrasion. The rapid, but partial, transportation of weathered rock\r\naccelerates weathering; but the complete removal of its products retards\r\nweathering.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  _Rate of Erosion and Rock Texture._\r\n\r\nOther things being equal, _erosion is most rapid when the eroded rock\r\noffers least resistance_; but the rocks which are most favorable to one\r\nportion of the process of erosion do not necessarily stand in the same\r\nrelation to the others. Disintegration by solution depends in large part\r\non the solubility of the rocks, but it proceeds most rapidly with those\r\nfragmental rocks of which the cement is soluble, and of which the\r\ntexture is open. Disintegration by frost is most rapid in rocks which\r\nabsorb a large percentage of water and are feebly coherent.\r\nDisintegration by mechanical wear is most rapid in soft rocks.\r\n\r\nTransportation is most favored by those rocks which yield by\r\ndisintegration the most finely comminuted _débris_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     _Rate of Erosion and Climate._\r\n\r\nThe influence of climate upon erosion is less easy to formulate. The\r\ndirect influences of temperature and rainfall are comparatively simple,\r\nbut their indirect influence through vegetation is complex, and is in\r\npart opposed to the direct.\r\n\r\nTemperature affects erosion chiefly by its changes. Where the range of\r\ntemperature includes the freezing point of water, frost contributes its\r\npowerful aid to weathering; and it is only where changes are great and\r\nsudden that rocks are cracked by their unequal expansion or contraction.\r\n\r\nAll the processes of erosion are affected directly by the amount of\r\nrainfall, and by its distribution through the year. All are accelerated\r\nby its increase and retarded by its diminution. When it is concentrated\r\nin one part of the year at the expense of the remainder, transportation\r\nand corrasion are accelerated, and weathering is retarded.\r\n\r\nWeathering is favored by abundance of moisture. Frost accomplishes most\r\nwhen the rocks are saturated; and solution when there is the freest\r\nsubterranean circulation. But when the annual rainfall is concentrated\r\ninto a limited season, a larger share of the water fails to penetrate,\r\nand the gain from temporary flooding does not compensate for the\r\nchecking of all solution by a long dry season.\r\n\r\nTransportation is favored by increasing water supply as greatly as by\r\nincreasing declivity. When the volume of a stream increases, it becomes\r\nat the same time more rapid, and its transporting capacity gains by the\r\nincrement to velocity as well as by the increment to volume. Hence the\r\nincrease in power of transportation is more than proportional to the\r\nincrease of volume.\r\n\r\nIt is due to this fact chiefly that the transportation of a stream which\r\nis subject to floods is greater than it would be if its total water\r\nsupply were evenly distributed in time.\r\n\r\nThe indirect influence of rainfall and temperature, by means of\r\nvegetation, has different laws. Vegetation is intimately related to\r\nwater supply. There is little or none where the annual precipitation is\r\nsmall, and it is profuse where the latter is great—especially where the\r\ntemperature is at the same time high. In proportion as vegetation is\r\nprofuse the solvent power of percolating water is increased, and on the\r\nother hand the ground is sheltered from the mechanical action of rains\r\nand rills. The removal of disintegrated rock is greatly impeded by the\r\nconservative power of roots and fallen leaves, and a soil is thus\r\npreserved. Transportation is retarded. Weathering by solution is\r\naccelerated up to a certain point, but in the end it suffers by the\r\nclogging of transportation. The work of frost is nearly stopped as soon\r\nas the depth of soil exceeds the limit of frost action. The force of\r\nrain drops is expended on foliage. Moreover a deep soil acts as a\r\ndistributing reservoir for the water of rains, and tends to equalize the\r\nflow of streams.\r\n\r\nHence the general effect of vegetation is to retard erosion; and since\r\nthe direct effect of great rainfall is the acceleration of erosion, it\r\nresults that its direct and indirect tendencies are in opposite\r\ndirections.\r\n\r\nIn arid regions of which the declivities are sufficient to give thorough\r\ndrainage, the absence of vegetation is accompanied by absence of soil.\r\nWhen a shower falls, nearly all the water runs off from the bare rock,\r\nand the little that is absorbed is rapidly reduced by evaporation.\r\nSolution becomes a slow process for lack of a continuous supply of\r\nwater, and frost accomplishes its work only when it closely follows the\r\ninfrequent rain. Thus weathering is retarded. Transportation has its\r\nwork so concentrated by the quick gathering of showers into floods, as\r\nto compensate, in part at least, for the smallness of the total rainfall\r\nfrom which they derive their power.\r\n\r\nHence in regions of small rainfall, surface degradation is usually\r\nlimited by the slow rate of disintegration; while in regions of great\r\nrainfall it is limited by the rate of transportation. There is probably\r\nan intermediate condition with moderate rainfall, in which a rate of\r\ndisintegration greater than that of an arid climate is balanced by a\r\nmore rapid transportation than consists with a very moist climate, and\r\nin which the rate of degradation attains its maximum.\r\n\r\nOver nearly the whole of the earth’s surface there is a soil, and\r\nwherever this exists we know that the conditions are more favorable to\r\nweathering than to transportation. Hence it is true in general that the\r\nconditions which limit transportation are those which limit the general\r\ndegradation of the surface.\r\n\r\nTo understand the manner in which this limit is reached it is necessary\r\nto look at the process by which the work is accomplished.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   _Transportation and Comminution._\r\n\r\nA stream of water flowing down its bed expends an amount of energy that\r\nis measured by the quantity of water and the vertical distance through\r\nwhich it descends. If there were no friction of the water upon its\r\nchannel the velocity of the current would continually increase; but if,\r\nas is the usual case, there is no increase of velocity, then the whole\r\nof the energy is consumed in friction. The friction produces\r\ninequalities in the motion of the water, and especially induces\r\nsubsidiary currents more or less oblique to the general onward movement.\r\nSome of these subsidiary currents have an upward tendency, and by them\r\nis performed the chief work of transportation. They lift small particles\r\nfrom the bottom and hold them in suspension while they move forward with\r\nthe general current. The finest particles sink most slowly and are\r\ncarried farthest before they fall. Larger ones are barely lifted, and\r\nare dropped at once. Still larger are only half lifted; that is, they\r\nare lifted on the side of the current and rolled over without quitting\r\nthe bottom. And finally there is a limit to the power of every current,\r\nand the largest fragments of its bed are not moved at all.\r\n\r\nThere is a definite relation between the velocity of a current and the\r\nsize of the largest bowlder it will roll. It has been shown by Hopkins\r\nthat the weight of the bowlder is proportioned to the sixth power of the\r\nvelocity. It is easily shown also that the weight of a suspended\r\nparticle is proportioned to the sixth power of the velocity of the\r\nupward current that will prevent its sinking. But it must not be\r\ninferred that the total load of detritus that a stream will transport\r\nbears any such relation to the rapidity of its current. The true\r\ninference is, that the velocity determines the size-limit of the\r\ndetritus that a stream can move by rolling, or can hold in suspension.\r\n\r\nEvery particle which a stream lifts and sustains is a draft upon its\r\nenergy, and the measure of the draft is the weight (weighed in water) of\r\nthe particle, multiplied by the distance it would sink in still water in\r\nthe time during which it is suspended. If for the sake of simplicity we\r\nsuppose the whole load of a stream to be of uniform particles, then the\r\nmeasure of the energy consumed in their transportation is their total\r\nweight multiplied by the distance one of them would sink in the time\r\noccupied in their transportation. Since fine particles sink more slowly\r\nthan coarse, the same consumption of energy will convey a greater load\r\nof fine than of coarse.\r\n\r\nAgain, the energy of a clear stream is entirely consumed in the friction\r\nof flow; and the friction bears a direct relation to its velocity. But\r\nif detritus be added to the water, then a portion of its energy is\r\ndiverted to the transportation of the load; and this is done at the\r\nexpense of the friction of flow, and hence at the expense of velocity.\r\nAs the energy expended in transportation increases, the velocity\r\ndiminishes. If the detritus be composed of uniform particles, then we\r\nmay also say that as the load increases the velocity diminishes. But the\r\ndiminishing velocity will finally reach a point at which it can barely\r\ntransport particles of the given size, and when this point is attained,\r\nthe stream has its maximum load of detritus of the given size. But fine\r\ndetritus requires less velocity for its transportation than coarse, and\r\nwill not so soon reduce the current to the limit of its efficiency. A\r\ngreater percentage of the total energy of the stream can hence be\r\nemployed by fine detritus than by coarse.\r\n\r\n(It should be explained that the friction of flow is in itself a complex\r\naffair. The water in contact with the bottom and walls of the channel\r\ndevelops friction by flowing past them, and that which is farther away\r\nby flowing past that which is near. The inequality of motion gives rise\r\nto cross currents and there is a friction of these upon each other. The\r\nratio or coefficient of friction of water against the substance of the\r\nbed, the coefficient of friction of water against water, or the\r\nviscosity of water, and the form of the bed, all conspire to determine\r\nthe resistance of flow and together make up what may be called the\r\ncoefficient of the friction of flow. The friction depends on its\r\ncoefficient and on the velocity.)\r\n\r\nThus the capacity of a stream for transportation is enhanced by\r\ncomminution in two ways. Fine detritus, on the one hand, consumes less\r\nenergy for the transportation of the same weight, and on the other, it\r\ncan utilize a greater portion of the stream’s energy.\r\n\r\nIt follows, as a corollary, that the velocity of a fully loaded stream\r\ndepends (_ceteris paribus_) on the comminution of the material of the\r\nload. When a stream has its maximum load of fine detritus, its velocity\r\nwill be less than when carrying its maximum load of coarse detritus; and\r\nthe greater load corresponds to the less velocity.\r\n\r\nIt follows also that a stream which is supplied with heterogeneous\r\n_débris_ will select the finest. If the finest is sufficient in quantity\r\nthe current will be so checked by it that the coarser cannot be moved.\r\nIf the finest is not sufficient the next grade will be taken, and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    _Transportation and Declivity._\r\n\r\nTo consider now the relation of declivity to transportation we will\r\nassume all other conditions to be constant. Let us suppose that two\r\nstreams have the same length, the same quantity of water, flow over beds\r\nof the same character, and are supplied to their full capacities with\r\ndetritus of the same kind; but differ in the total amount of fall. Their\r\ndeclivities or rates of fall are proportional to their falls. Since the\r\nenergy of a stream is measured by the product of its volume and its\r\nfall, the relative energies of the two streams are proportional to their\r\nfalls, and hence proportional to their declivities. The velocities of\r\nthe two streams, depending, as we have seen above, on the character of\r\nthe detritus which loads them, are the same; and hence the same amount\r\nof energy is consumed by each in the friction of flow. And since the\r\nenergy which each stream expends in transportation is the residual after\r\ndeducting what it spends in friction from its total energy, it is\r\nevident that the stream with the greater declivity will not merely have\r\nthe greater energy, but will expend a less percentage of it in friction\r\nand a greater percentage in transportation.\r\n\r\nHence declivity favors transportation in a degree that is greater than\r\nits simple ratio.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are two elements of which no account is taken in the preceding\r\ndiscussion, but which need to be mentioned to prevent misapprehension,\r\nalthough they detract in no way from the conclusions.\r\n\r\nThe first is the addition which the transported detritus makes to the\r\nenergy of the stream. A stream of water charged with detritus is at once\r\na compound and an unstable fluid. It has been treated merely as an\r\nunstable fluid requiring a constant expenditure of energy to maintain\r\nits constitution; but looking at it as a compound fluid, it is plain\r\nthat the energy it develops by its descent is greater than the energy\r\npertaining to the water alone, in the precise ratio of the mass of the\r\nmixture to the mass of the simple water.\r\n\r\nThe second element is the addition which the detritus makes to the\r\nfriction of flow. The coefficient of friction of the compound stream\r\nupon its bottom will always be greater than that of the simple stream of\r\nwater, and the coefficient of internal friction or the viscosity will be\r\ngreater than that of pure water, and hence for the same velocity a\r\ngreater amount of energy will be consumed.\r\n\r\nIt may be noted in passing, that the energy which is consumed in the\r\nfriction of the detritus on the stream bed, accomplishes as part of its\r\nwork the mechanical corrasion of the bed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                _Transportation and Quantity of Water._\r\n\r\nA stream’s friction of flow depends mainly on the character of the bed,\r\non the area of the surface of contact, and on the velocity of the\r\ncurrent. When the other elements are constant, the friction varies\r\napproximately with the area of contact. The area of contact depends on\r\nthe length and form of the channel, and on the quantity of water. For\r\nstreams of the same length and same form of cross-section, but differing\r\nin size of cross-section, the area of contact varies directly as the\r\nsquare root of the quantity of water. Hence, _ceteris paribus_, the\r\nfriction of a stream on its bed is proportioned to the square root of\r\nthe quantity of water. But as stated above, the total energy of a stream\r\nis proportioned directly to the quantity of water; and the total energy\r\nis equal to the energy spent in friction, plus the energy spent in\r\ntransportation. Whence it follows that if a stream change its quantity\r\nof water without changing its velocity or other accidents, the total\r\nenergy will change at the same rate as the quantity of water; the energy\r\nspent in friction will change at a less rate, and the energy remaining\r\nfor transportation will change at a greater rate.\r\n\r\nHence increase in quantity of water favors transportation in a degree\r\nthat is greater than its simple ratio.\r\n\r\nIt follows as a corollary that the running water which carries the\r\n_débris_ of a district loses power by subdivision toward its sources;\r\nand that, unless there is a compensating increment of declivity, the\r\ntributaries of a river will fail to supply it with the full load it is\r\nable to carry.\r\n\r\nIt is noteworthy also that the obstruction which vegetation opposes to\r\ntransportation is especially effective in that it is applied at the\r\ninfinitesimal sources of streams, where the force of the running water\r\nis least.\r\n\r\nA stream which can transport _débris_ of a given size, may be said to be\r\n_competent_ to such _débris_. Since the maximum particles which streams\r\nare able to move are proportioned to the sixth powers of their\r\nvelocities, competence depends on velocity. Velocity, in turn, depends\r\non declivity and volume, and (inversely) on load.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn brief, the capacity of a stream for transportation is greater for\r\nfine _débris_ than for coarse.\r\n\r\nIts capacity for the transportation of a given kind of _débris_ is\r\nenlarged in more than simple ratio by increase of declivity; and it is\r\nenlarged in more than simple ratio by increase of volume.\r\n\r\nThe competence of a stream for the transport of _débris_ of a given\r\nfineness, is limited by a corresponding velocity.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _rate_ of transportation of _débris_ of a given fineness may equal\r\nthe capacity of the transporting stream, or it may be less. When it is\r\nless, it is always from the insufficiency of supply. The supply\r\nfurnished by weathering is never available unless the degree of fineness\r\nof the _débris_ brings it within the competence of the stream at the\r\npoint of supply.\r\n\r\nThe chief point of supply is at the very head of the flowing water. The\r\nrain which falls on material that has been disintegrated by weathering,\r\nbegins after it has saturated the immediate surface to flow off. But it\r\nforms a very thin sheet; its friction is great; its velocity is small;\r\nand it is competent to pick up only particles of exceeding fineness. If\r\nthe material is heterogeneous, it discriminates and leaves the coarser\r\nparticles. As the sheet moves on it becomes deeper and soon begins to\r\ngather itself into rills. As the deepening and concentration of water\r\nprogresses, either its _capacity_ increases and the load of fine\r\nparticles is augmented, or, if fine particles are not in sufficient\r\nforce, its _competence_ increases, and larger ones are lifted. In either\r\ncase the load is augmented, and as rill joins rill it steadily grows,\r\nuntil the accumulated water finally passes beyond the zone of\r\ndisintegrated material.\r\n\r\nThe particles which the feeble initial currents are not competent to\r\nmove, have to wait either until they are subdivided by the agencies of\r\nweathering, or until the deepening of the channels of the rills so far\r\nincreases the declivities that the currents acquire the requisite\r\nvelocity, or until some fiercer storm floods the ground with a deeper\r\nsheet of water.\r\n\r\nThus rate of transportation, as well as capacity for transportation, is\r\nfavored by fineness of _débris_, by declivity, and by quantity of water.\r\nIt is opposed chiefly by vegetation, which holds together that which is\r\nloosened by weathering, and shields it from the agent of transportation\r\nin the very place where that agent is weakest.\r\n\r\nWhen the current of a stream gradually diminishes in its course—as for\r\nexample in approaching the ocean—the capacity for transportation also\r\ndiminishes; and so soon as the capacity becomes less than the load,\r\nprecipitation begins—the coarser particles being deposited first.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    _Corrasion and Transportation._\r\n\r\nWhere a stream has all the load of a given degree of comminution which\r\nit is capable of carrying, the entire energy of the descending water and\r\nload is consumed in the translation of the water and load and there is\r\nnone applied to corrasion. If it has an excess of load its velocity is\r\nthereby diminished so as to lessen its competence and a portion is\r\ndropped. If it has less than a full load it is in condition to receive\r\nmore and it corrades its bottom.\r\n\r\nA fully loaded stream is on the verge between corrasion and deposition.\r\nAs will be explained in another place, it may wear the walls of its\r\nchannel, but its wear of one wall will be accompanied by an addition to\r\nthe opposite wall.\r\n\r\nThe work of transportation may thus monopolize a stream to the exclusion\r\nof corrasion, or the two works may be carried forward at the same time.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _Corrasion and Declivity._\r\n\r\nThe rapidity of mechanical corrasion depends on the hardness, size, and\r\nnumber of the transient fragments, on the hardness of the rock-bed, and\r\non the velocity of the stream. The blows which the moving fragments deal\r\nupon the stream bed are hard in proportion as the fragments are large\r\nand the current is swift. They are most effective when the fragments are\r\nhard and the bed-rock is soft. They are more numerous and harder upon\r\nthe bottom of the channel than upon the sides because of the constant\r\ntendency of the particles to sink in water. Their number is increased up\r\nto a certain limit by the increase of the load of the stream; but when\r\nthe fragments become greatly crowded at the bottom of a stream their\r\nforce is partially spent among themselves, and the bed-rock is in the\r\nsame degree protected. For this reason, and because increase of load\r\ncauses retardation of current, it is probable that the maximum work of\r\ncorrasion is performed when the load is far within the transporting\r\ncapacity.\r\n\r\nThe element of velocity is of double importance since it determines not\r\nonly the speed, but to a great extent the size of the pestles which\r\ngrind the rocks. The coefficients upon which it in turn depends, namely,\r\ndeclivity and quantity of water, have the same importance in corrasion\r\nthat they have in transportation.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose that a stream endowed with a constant volume of water, is\r\nat some point continuously supplied with as great a load as it is\r\ncapable of carrying. For so great a distance as its velocity remains the\r\nsame, it will neither corrade (downward) nor deposit, but will leave the\r\ngrade of its bed unchanged. But if in its progress it reaches a place\r\nwhere a less declivity of bed gives a diminished velocity, its capacity\r\nfor transportation will become less than the load and part of the load\r\nwill be deposited. Or if in its progress it reaches a place where a\r\ngreater declivity of bed gives an increased velocity, the capacity for\r\ntransportation will become greater than the load and there will be\r\ncorrasion of the bed. In this way a stream which has a supply of\r\n_débris_ equal to its capacity, tends to build up the gentler slopes of\r\nits bed and cut away the steeper. It tends to establish a single,\r\nuniform grade.\r\n\r\nLet us now suppose that the stream after having obliterated all the\r\ninequalities of the grade of its bed loses nearly the whole of its load.\r\nIts velocity is at once accelerated and vertical corrasion begins\r\nthrough its whole length. Since the stream has the same declivity and\r\nconsequently the same velocity at all points, its capacity for corrasion\r\nis everywhere the same. Its rate of corrasion however will depend on the\r\ncharacter of its bed. Where the rock is hard corrasion will be less\r\nrapid than where it is soft, and there will result inequalities of\r\ngrade. But so soon as there is inequality of grade there is inequality\r\nof velocity, and inequality of capacity for corrasion; and where hard\r\nrocks have produced declivities, there the capacity for corrasion will\r\nbe increased. The differentiation will proceed until the capacity for\r\ncorrasion is everywhere proportioned to the resistance, and no\r\nfurther,—that is, until there is an equilibrium of action.\r\n\r\nIn general, we may say that a stream tends to equalize its work in all\r\nparts of its course. Its power inheres in its fall, and each foot of\r\nfall has the same power. When its work is to corrade and the resistance\r\nis unequal, it concentrates its energy where the resistance is great by\r\ncrowding many feet of descent into a small space, and diffuses it where\r\nthe resistance is small by using but a small fall in a long distance.\r\nWhen its work is to transport, the resistance is constant and the fall\r\nis evenly distributed by a uniform grade. When its work includes both\r\ntransportation and corrasion, as in the usual case, its grades are\r\nsomewhat unequal; and the inequality is greatest when the load is least.\r\n\r\nIt is to be remarked that in the case of most streams it is the flood\r\nstage which determines the grades of the channel. The load of detritus\r\nis usually greatest during the highest floods, and power is conferred so\r\nrapidly with increase of quantity of water, that in any event the\r\ninfluence of the stream during its high stage will overpower any\r\ninfluence which may have been exerted at a low stage. That relation of\r\ntransportation to corrasion which subsists when the water is high will\r\ndetermine the grades of the waterway.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   _Declivity and Quantity of Water._\r\n\r\nThe conclusions reached in regard to the relations of corrasion and\r\ndeclivity depend on the assumption that the volume of the stream is the\r\nsame throughout its whole course, and they consequently apply directly\r\nto such portions only of streams as are not increased by tributaries. A\r\nsimple modification will include the more general case of branching\r\nstreams.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose that two equal streams which join, have the same\r\ndeclivity, and are both fully loaded with detritus of the same kind. If\r\nthe channel down which they flow after union has also the same\r\ndeclivity, then the joint stream will have a greater velocity than its\r\nbranches, its capacity for transportation will be more than adequate for\r\nthe joint load, and it will corrade its bottom. By its corrasion it will\r\ndiminish the declivity of its bed, and consequently its velocity and\r\ncapacity for transportation, until its capacity is equal to the total\r\ncapacity of its tributaries. When an equilibrium of action is reached,\r\nthe declivity of the main stream will be less than the declivities of\r\nits branches. This result does not depend on the assumed equality of the\r\nbranches, nor upon their number. It is equally true that in any river\r\nsystem which is fully supplied with material for transportation and\r\nwhich has attained a condition of equal action, the declivity of the\r\nsmaller streams is greater than that of the larger.\r\n\r\nLet us further suppose that two equal streams which join, are only\r\npartially loaded, and are corrading at a common rate a common rock. If\r\nthe channel down which they flow after union is in the same rock and has\r\nthe same declivity, then the joint river will have a greater velocity,\r\nand will corrade more rapidly than its branches. By its more rapid\r\ncorrasion it will diminish the declivity of its bed, until as before\r\nthere is an equilibrium of action,—the branch having a greater declivity\r\nthan the main. This result also is independent of the number and\r\nequality of the branches; and it is equally true that in any river\r\nsystem which traverses and corrades rock of equal resistance throughout,\r\nand which has reached a condition of equal action, the declivity of the\r\nsmaller streams is greater than that of the larger.\r\n\r\nIn general we may say that, _ceteris paribus, declivity hears an inverse\r\nrelation to quantity of water_.\r\n\r\n(There is an apparent exception to this law, which is specially\r\nnoteworthy in the sculpture of bad-lands, and will be described in\r\nanother place).\r\n\r\n\r\n                             II. SCULPTURE.\r\n\r\nErosion may be regarded from several points of view. It lays bare rocks\r\nwhich were before covered and concealed, and is thence called\r\n_denudation_. It reduces the surfaces of mountains, plateaus, and\r\ncontinents, and is thence called _degradation_. It carves new forms of\r\nland from those which before existed, and is thence called _land\r\nsculpture_. In the following pages it will be considered as land\r\nsculpture, and attention will be called to certain principles of erosion\r\nwhich are concerned in the production of topographic forms.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _Sculpture and Declivity._\r\n\r\nWe have already seen that erosion is favored by declivity. Where the\r\ndeclivity is great the agents of erosion are powerful; where it is small\r\nthey are weak; where there is no declivity they are powerless. Moreover\r\nit has been shown that their power increases with the declivity in more\r\nthan simple ratio.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that if steep slopes are worn more rapidly than gentle,\r\nthe tendency is to abolish all differences of slope and produce\r\nuniformity. The law of uniform slope thus opposes diversity of\r\ntopography, and if not complemented by other laws, would reduce all\r\ndrainage basins to plains. But in reality it is never free to work out\r\nits full results; for it demands a uniformity of conditions which\r\nnowhere exists. Only a water sheet of uniform depth, flowing over a\r\nsurface of homogeneous material, would suffice; and every inequality of\r\nwater depth or of rock texture produces a corresponding inequality of\r\nslope and diversity of form. The reliefs of the landscape exemplify\r\nother laws, and the law of uniform slopes is merely the conservative\r\nelement which limits their results.\r\n\r\n\r\n            _Sculpture and Structure; the Law of Structure._\r\n\r\nWe have already seen that erosion is influenced by rock character.\r\nCertain rocks, of which the hard are most conspicuous, oppose a stubborn\r\nresistance to erosive agencies; certain others, of which the soft are\r\nmost conspicuous, oppose a feeble resistance. Erosion is most rapid\r\nwhere the resistance is least, and hence as the soft rocks are worn away\r\nthe hard are left prominent. The differentiation continues until an\r\nequilibrium is reached through the law of declivities. When the ratio of\r\nerosive action as dependent on declivities becomes equal to the ratio of\r\nresistances as dependent on rock character, there is equality of action.\r\nIn the structure of the earth’s crust hard and soft rocks are grouped\r\nwith infinite diversity of arrangement. They are in masses of all forms,\r\nand dimensions, and positions; and from these forms are carved an\r\ninfinite variety of topographic reliefs.\r\n\r\nIn so far as the law of structure controls sculpture, hard masses stand\r\nas eminences and soft are carved in valleys.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         _The Law of Divides._\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the declivity over which water flows bears an inverse\r\nrelation to the quantity of water. If we follow a stream from its mouth\r\nupward and pass successively the mouths of its tributaries, we find its\r\nvolume gradually less and less and its grade steeper and steeper, until\r\nfinally at its head we reach the steepest grade of all. If we draw the\r\nprofile of the river on paper, we produce a curve concave upward and\r\nwith the greatest curvature at the upper end. The same law applies to\r\nevery tributary and even to the slopes over which the freshly fallen\r\nrain flows in a sheet before it is gathered into rills. The nearer the\r\nwatershed or divide the steeper the slope; the farther away the less the\r\nslope.\r\n\r\nIt is in accordance with this law that mountains are steepest at their\r\ncrests. The profile of a mountain if taken along drainage lines is\r\nconcave outward as represented in the diagram; and this is purely a\r\nmatter of sculpture, the uplifts from which mountains are carved rarely\r\nif ever assuming this form.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 54.—Typical profile of the Drainage Slopes of Mountains.\r\n]\r\n\r\nUnder the _law of Structure_ and the _law of Divides_ combined, the\r\nfeatures of the earth are carved. Declivities are steep in proportion as\r\ntheir material is hard; and they are steep in proportion as they are\r\nnear divides. The distribution of hard and soft rocks, or the geological\r\nstructure, and the distribution of drainage lines and watersheds, are\r\ncoefficient conditions on which depends the sculpture of the land. In\r\nthe sequel it will be shown that the distribution of drainage lines and\r\nwatersheds depends in part on that of hard and soft rocks.\r\n\r\nIn some places the first of the two conditions is the more important, in\r\nothers the second. In the bed of a stream without tributaries the grade\r\ndepends on the structure of the underlying rocks. In rock which is\r\nhomogeneous and structureless all slopes depend on the distribution of\r\ndivides and drainage lines.\r\n\r\nThe relative importance of the two conditions is especially affected by\r\nclimate, and the influence of this factor is so great that it may claim\r\nrank as a third condition of sculpture.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        _Sculpture and Climate._\r\n\r\nThe Henry Mountains consist topographically of five individuals,\r\nseparated by low passes, and practically independent in climate. At the\r\nsame time they are all of one type of structure, being constituted by\r\nsimilar aggregation of hard and soft rocks. Their altitudes appear in\r\nthe following table.\r\n\r\n                                Altitude above the sea.\r\n                Mount Ellen                11,250 feet.\r\n                Mount Pennell              11,150 feet.\r\n                Mount Hillers              10,500 feet.\r\n                Mount Ellsworth             8,000 feet.\r\n                Mount Holmes                7,775 feet.\r\n\r\nThe plain on which they stand has a mean altitude of 5,500 feet, and is\r\na desert. A large proportion of the rain which falls in the region is\r\ncaught by the mountains, and especially by the higher mountains. Of this\r\nthere is abundant proof in the distribution of vegetation and of\r\nsprings.\r\n\r\nThe vegetation of the plain is exceedingly meager, comprising only\r\nsparsely set grasses and shrubs, and in favored spots the dwarf cedar of\r\nthe West (_Juniperus occidentalis_).\r\n\r\nMount Ellen, which has a continuous ridge two miles long and more than\r\n11,000 feet high, bears cedar about its base, mingled higher up with\r\npiñon (_Pinus edulis_), and succeeded above by the yellow pine (_P.\r\nponderosa_), spruce (_Abies Douglasii_), fir (_A. Engelmanni_), and\r\naspen (_Populus tremuloides_). The pines are scattering, but the cedars\r\nare close set, and the firs are in dense groves. The upper slopes where\r\nnot timbered are matted with luxuriant grasses and herbs. The summits\r\nare naked.\r\n\r\nMount Pennell sends a single peak only to the height of the Ellen ridge.\r\nIts vegetation is nearly the same, but the timber extends almost to the\r\nsummit.\r\n\r\nMount Hillers is 650 feet lower. Its timber reaches to the principal\r\nsummit, but is less dense than on the higher mountains. The range of\r\ntrees is the same.\r\n\r\nMount Ellsworth, 2,500 feet lower than Mount Hillers, bears neither fir,\r\nspruce, pine nor aspen. Cedar and piñon climb to the summit, but are not\r\nso thickly set as on the lower slopes of the larger mountains. The\r\ngrasses are less rank and grow in scattered bunches.\r\n\r\nMount Holmes, a few feet lower, has the same flora, with the addition of\r\na score of spruce trees, high up on the northern flank. Its summits are\r\nbare.\r\n\r\nIn a word, the luxuriance of vegetation, and the annual rainfall, of\r\nwhich it is the index, are proportioned to the altitude.\r\n\r\nConsider now the forms of the mountain tops.\r\n\r\nIn Figure 55 are pictured the summit forms of Mount Ellen. The crests\r\nare rounded; the slopes are uniform and smooth. Examination has shown\r\nthat the constituent rocks are of varying degrees of hardness, trachyte\r\ndikes alternating with sandstones and shales; but these variations\r\nrarely find expression in the sculptured forms.\r\n\r\nIn Figure 56 are the summit crags of Mount Holmes. They are dikes of\r\ntrachyte denuded by a discriminating erosion of their encasements of\r\nsandstone, and carved in bold relief. In virtue of their superior\r\nhardness they survive the general degradation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 55.—The Crest of Mount Ellen, as seen from Ellen Peak.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 56.—The Crest of Mount Holmes.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe other mountains are intermediate in the character of their\r\nsculpture. Mount Pennell is nearly as smooth as Mount Ellen. Mount\r\nEllsworth is nearly as rugged as Mount Holmes. One may ride to the crest\r\nof Mount Ellen and to the summit of Mount Pennell; he may lead his\r\nsure-footed cayuse to the top of Mount Hillers; but Mounts Ellsworth and\r\nHolmes are not to be scaled by horses. The mountaineer must climb to\r\nreach their summits, and for part of the way use hands as well as feet.\r\n\r\nIn a word, the ruggedness of the summits or the differentiation of hard\r\nand soft by sculpture, is proportioned inversely to the altitude. And\r\nrainfall, which in these mountains depends directly on altitude, is\r\nproportioned inversely to ruggedness.\r\n\r\nThe explanation of this coincidence depends on the general relations of\r\nvegetation to erosion.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that vegetation favors the disintegration of rocks and\r\nretards the transportation of the disintegrated material. Where\r\nvegetation is profuse there is always an excess of material awaiting\r\ntransportation, and the limit to the rate of erosion comes to be merely\r\nthe limit to the rate of transportation. And since the diversities of\r\nrock texture, such as hardness and softness, affect only the rate of\r\ndisintegration (weathering and corrasion) and not the rate of\r\ntransportation, these diversities do not affect the rate of erosion in\r\nregions of profuse vegetation, and do not produce corresponding\r\ndiversities of form.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, where vegetation is scant or absent, transportation\r\nand corrasion are favored, while weathering is retarded. There is no\r\naccumulation of disintegrated material. The rate of erosion is limited\r\nby the rate of weathering, and that varies with the diversity of rock\r\ntexture. The soft are eaten away faster than the hard; and the structure\r\nis embodied in the topographic forms.\r\n\r\nThus a moist climate by stimulating vegetation produces a sculpture\r\nindependent of diversities of rock texture, and a dry climate by\r\nrepressing vegetation produces a sculpture dependent on those\r\ndiversities. With great moisture the law of divides is supreme; with\r\naridity, the law of structure.\r\n\r\nHence it is that the upper slopes of the loftier of the Henry Mountains\r\nare so carved as to conceal the structure, while the lower slopes of the\r\nsame mountains and the entire forms of the less lofty mountains are so\r\ncarved as to reveal the structure; and hence too it is that the arid\r\nplateaus of the Colorado Basin abound in cliffs and cañons, and offer\r\nfacilities to the student of geological structure which no humid region\r\ncan afford.\r\n\r\nHere too is the answer to the question so often asked, “whether the\r\nrains and rivers which excavated the cañons and carved the cliffs were\r\nnot mightier than the rains and rivers of to-day.” Aridity being an\r\nessential condition of this peculiar type of sculpture, we may be sure\r\nthat through long ages it has characterized the climate of the Colorado\r\nBasin. A climate of great rainfall, as Professor Powell has already\r\npointed out in his “Exploration of the Colorado,” would have produced\r\ncurves and gentle slopes in place of the actual angles and cliffs.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              _Bad-lands._\r\n\r\nMountain forms in general depend more on the law of divides than on the\r\nlaw of structure, but their independence of structure is rarely perfect,\r\nand it is difficult to discriminate the results of the two principles.\r\nFor the investigation of the workings of the law of divides it is better\r\nto select examples from regions which afford no variety of rock texture\r\nand are hence unaffected in their erosion by the law of structure. Such\r\nexamples are found in _bad-lands_.\r\n\r\nWhere a homogeneous, soft rock is subjected to rapid degradation in an\r\narid climate, its surface becomes absolutely bare of vegetation and is\r\ncarved into forms of great regularity and beauty. In the neighborhood of\r\nthe Henry Mountains, the Blue Gate and Tununk shales are of this\r\ncharacter, and their exposures afford many opportunities for the study\r\nof the principles of sculpture. I was able to devote no time to them,\r\nbut in riding across them my attention was attracted by some of the more\r\nstriking features, and these I will venture to present, although I am\r\nconscious that they form but a small part of the whole material which\r\nthe bad-lands may be made to yield.\r\n\r\nIf we examine a bad-land ridge, separating two drainage lines and\r\nforming a divide between them, we find an arrangement of secondary\r\nridges and secondary drainage lines, similar to that represented in the\r\ndiagram, (Figure 58.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 57.—General view of the Plateaus lying East of the Henry\r\n    Mountains.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe general course of the main ridge being straight, its course in\r\ndetail is found to bear a simple relation to the secondary ridges.\r\nWherever a secondary joins, the main ridge turns, its angle being\r\ndirectly toward the secondary. The divide thus follows a zigzag course,\r\nbeing deflected to the right or left by each lateral spur.\r\n\r\nThe altitude of the main ridge is correspondingly related to the\r\nsecondary ridges. At every point of union there is a maximum, and in the\r\nintervals are saddles. The maxima are not all equal, but bear some\r\nrelation to the magnitudes of the corresponding secondary ridges, and\r\nare especially accented where two or more secondaries join at the same\r\npoint. (See profile in Figure 59.)\r\n\r\nI conceive that the explanation of these phenomena is as follows: The\r\nheads of the secondary drainage lines laid down in the diagram are in\r\nnature tolerably definite points. The water which during rain converges\r\nat one of these points is there abruptly concentrated in volume. Above\r\nthe point it is a sheet, or at least is divided into many rills. Below\r\nit, it is a single stream with greatly increased power of transportation\r\nand corrasion. The principle of equal action gives to the concentrated\r\nstream a less declivity than to the diffused sheet, and—what is\r\nespecially important—it tends to produce an equal grade in all\r\ndirections upward from the point of convergence. The converging surface\r\nbecomes hopper-shaped or funnel-shaped; and as the point of convergence\r\nis lowered by corrasion, the walls of the funnel are eaten back equally\r\nin all directions—except of course the direction of the stream. The\r\ninfluence of the stream in stimulating erosion above its head is thus\r\nextended radially and equally through an arc of 180°, of which the\r\ncenter is at the point of convergence.\r\n\r\nWhere two streams head near each other, the influence of each tends to\r\npare away the divide between them, and by paring to carry it farther\r\nback. The position of the divide is determined by the two influences\r\ncombined and represents the line of equilibrium between them. The\r\ninfluences being radial from the points of convergence, the line of\r\nequilibrium is tangential, and is consequently at right angles to a line\r\nconnecting the two points. Thus, for example, if _a_, _b_, and _c_\r\n(Figure 58) are the points of convergence at the heads of three drainage\r\nlines, the divide line _ed_ is at right angles to a line connecting _a_\r\nand _b_, and the divides _fd_ and _gd_ are similarly determined. The\r\npoint _d_ is simultaneously determined by the intersection of the three\r\ndivide lines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 58.—Ground plan of a Bad-land Ridge, showing its relation to\r\n    Waterways. The smooth lines represent Divides.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 59.—Profile of the same ridge.\r\n]\r\n\r\nFurthermore, since that point of the line _ed_ which lies directly\r\nbetween _a_ and _b_ is nearest to those points, it is the point of the\r\ndivide most subject to the erosive influences which radiate from _a_ and\r\n_b_, and it is consequently degraded lower than the contiguous portions\r\nof the divide. The points _d_ and _e_ are less reduced; and _d_, which\r\ncan be shown by similar reasoning to stand higher than the adjacent\r\nportion of either of the three ridges which there unite, is a local\r\nmaximum.\r\n\r\nThere is one other peculiarity of bad-land forms which is of great\r\nsignificance, but which I shall nevertheless not undertake to explain.\r\nAccording to the law of divides, as stated in a previous paragraph, the\r\nprofile of any slope in bad-lands should be concave upward, and the\r\nslope should be steepest at the divide. The union or intersection of two\r\nslopes on a divide should produce an angle. But in point of fact the\r\nslopes do not unite in an angle. They unite in a curve, and the profile\r\nof a drainage slope instead of being concave all the way to its summit,\r\nchanges its curvature and becomes convex. Figure 60 represents a profile\r\nfrom _a_ to _b_ of Figure 58. From _a_ to _m_ and from _b_ to _n_ the\r\nslopes are concave, but from _m_ to _n_ there is a convex curvature.\r\nWhere the flanking slopes are as steep as represented in the diagram,\r\nthe convexity on the crest of a ridge has a breadth of only two or three\r\nyards, but where the flanking slopes are gentle, its breadth is several\r\ntimes as great. It is never absent.\r\n\r\nThus in the sculpture of the bad-lands there is revealed an exception to\r\nthe law of divides,—an exception which cannot be referred to accidents\r\nof structure, and which is as persistent in its recurrence as are the\r\nfeatures which conform to the law,—an exception which in some\r\nunexplained way is part of the law. Our analysis of the agencies and\r\nconditions of erosion, on the one hand, has led to the conclusion that\r\n(where structure does not prevent) the declivities of a continuous\r\ndrainage slope increase as the quantities of water flowing over them\r\ndecrease; and that they are great in proportion as they are near\r\ndivides. Our observation, on the other hand, shows that the declivities\r\nincrease as the quantities of water diminish, up to a certain point\r\nwhere the quantity is very small, and then decrease; and that\r\ndeclivities are great in proportion as they are near divides, unless\r\nthey are _very_ near divides. Evidently some factor has been overlooked\r\nin the analysis,—a factor which in the main is less important than the\r\nflow of water, but which asserts its existence at those points where the\r\nflow of water is exceedingly small, and is there supreme.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 60.—Cross-profile of a Bad-land Divide.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                  _Equal Action and Interdependence._\r\n\r\nThe tendency to equality of action, or to the establishment of a dynamic\r\nequilibrium, has already been pointed out in the discussion of the\r\nprinciples of erosion and of sculpture, but one of its most important\r\nresults has not been noticed.\r\n\r\nOf the main conditions which determine the rate of erosion, namely,\r\nquantity of running water, vegetation, texture of rock, and declivity,\r\nonly the last is reciprocally determined by rate of erosion. Declivity\r\noriginates in upheaval, or in the displacements of the earth’s crust by\r\nwhich mountains and continents are formed; but it receives its\r\ndistribution in detail in accordance with the laws of erosion. Wherever\r\nby reason of change in any of the conditions the erosive agents come to\r\nhave locally exceptional power, that power is steadily diminished by the\r\nreaction of rate of erosion upon declivity. Every slope is a member of a\r\nseries, receiving the water and the waste of the slope above it, and\r\ndischarging its own water and waste upon the slope below. If one member\r\nof the series is eroded with exceptional rapidity, two things\r\nimmediately result: first, the member above has its level of discharge\r\nlowered, and its rate of erosion is thereby increased; and second, the\r\nmember below, being clogged by an exceptional load of detritus, has its\r\nrate of erosion diminished. The acceleration above and the retardation\r\nbelow, diminish the declivity of the member in which the disturbance\r\noriginated; and as the declivity is reduced the rate of erosion is\r\nlikewise reduced.\r\n\r\nBut the effect does not stop here. The disturbance which has been\r\ntransferred from one member of the series to the two which adjoin it, is\r\nby them transmitted to others, and does not cease until it has reached\r\nthe confines of the drainage basin. For in each basin all lines of\r\ndrainage unite in a main line, and a disturbance upon any line is\r\ncommunicated through it to the main line and thence to every tributary.\r\nAnd as any member of the system may influence all the others, so each\r\nmember is influenced by every other. There is an interdependence\r\nthroughout the system.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       III.—SYSTEMS OF DRAINAGE.\r\n\r\nTo know well the drainage of a region two systems of lines must be\r\nascertained—the drainage lines and the divides. The maxima of surface on\r\nwhich waters part, and the minima of surface in which waters join, are\r\nalike intimately associated with the sculpture of the earth and with the\r\nhistory of the earth’s structure; and the student of either sculpture or\r\nhistory can well afford to study them. In the following pages certain\r\nconditions which affect their permanence and transformations are\r\ndiscussed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    THE STABILITY OF DRAINAGE LINES.\r\n\r\nIn corrasion the chief work is performed by the impact and friction of\r\nhard and heavy particles moved forward by running water. They are driven\r\nagainst all sides of the channel, but their tendency to sink in water\r\nbrings them against the bottom with greater frequency and force than\r\nagainst the walls. If the rate of wear be rapid, by far the greater part\r\nof it is applied to the bottom, and the downward corrasion is so much\r\nmore powerful than the lateral that the effect of the latter is\r\npractically lost, and the channel of the stream, without varying the\r\nposition of its banks, carves its way vertically into the rock beneath.\r\nIt is only when corrasion is exceedingly slow that the lateral wear\r\nbecomes of importance; and hence as a rule the position of a stream bed\r\nis permanent.\r\n\r\nThe stability of drainage lines is especially illustrated in regions of\r\ndisplacement. If a mountain is slowly lifted athwart the course of a\r\nstream, the corrasion of the latter is accelerated by the increase of\r\ndeclivity, and instead of being turned aside by the uplift, it\r\npersistently holds its place and carves a channel into the mountain as\r\nthe mountain rises. For example the deep clefts which intersect the\r\nWasatch range owe their existence to the fact that at the time of the\r\nbeginning of the uplift which has made the range, there were streams\r\nflowing across the line of its trend which were too powerful to be\r\nturned back by the growing ridge. The same relation has been shown by\r\nProfessor Powell where the Green River crosses the uplift of the Uinta\r\nMountains, and in many instances throughout the Rocky Mountain region it\r\nmay be said that rivers have cut their way through mountains merely\r\nbecause they had established their courses before the inception of the\r\ndisplacement, and could not be diverted by an obstruction which was\r\nthrown up with the slowness of mountain uplift.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   THE INSTABILITY OF DRAINAGE LINES.\r\n\r\nThe stability of waterways being the rule, every case of instability\r\nrequires an explanation; and in the study of such exceptional cases\r\nthere have been found a number of different methods by which the courses\r\nof streams are shifted. The more important will be noted.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               _Ponding._\r\n\r\nWhen a mountain uplift crosses the course of a stream, it often happens\r\nthat the rate of uplift is too rapid to be equaled by the corrasion of\r\nthe stream, and the uprising rock becomes a dam over which the water\r\nstill runs, but above which there is accumulated a pond or lake.\r\nWhenever this takes place, the pond catches all the _débris_ of the\r\nupper course of the stream, and the water which overflows at the outlet\r\nhaving been relieved of its load is almost powerless for corrasion, and\r\ncannot continue its contest with the uplift unless the pond is silted up\r\nwith detritus. As the uplift progresses the level of the pond is raised\r\nhigher and higher, until finally it finds a new outlet at some other\r\npoint. The original outlet is at once abandoned, and the new one becomes\r\na permanent part of the course of the stream. As a rule it is only large\r\nstreams which hold their courses while mountains rise; the smaller are\r\nturned back by ponding, and are usually diverted so as to join the\r\nlarger.\r\n\r\nThe disturbances which divert drainage lines are not always of the sort\r\nwhich produce mountains. The same results may follow the most gentle\r\nundulations of plains. It required a movement of a few feet only to\r\nchange the outlet of Lakes Michigan, Huron, and Superior from the\r\nIllinois River to the St. Clair; and in the tilting which turned Lake\r\nWinipeg from the Mississippi to the Nelson no abrupt slopes were\r\nproduced. If the entire history of the latter case were worked out, it\r\nwould probably appear that the Saskatchewan River which rises in the\r\nRocky Mountains beyond our northern boundary, was formerly the upper\r\ncourse of the Mississippi, and that when, by the rising of land in\r\nMinnesota or its sinking at the north, a barrier was formed, the water\r\nwas ponded and Lake Winipeg came into existence. By the continuance of\r\nthe movement of the land the lake was increased until it overflowed into\r\nHudson’s Bay; and by its further continuance, combined with the\r\ncorrasion of the outlet, the lake has been again diminished. When\r\neventually the lake disappears the revolution will be complete, and the\r\nSaskatchewan will flow directly to Hudson’s Bay, as it once flowed\r\ndirectly to the Gulf of Mexico. (See the “Physical Features of the\r\nValley of the Minnesota River,” by General G. K. Warren.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                              _Planation._\r\n\r\nIt has been shown in the discussion of the relations of transportation\r\nand corrasion that downward wear ceases when the load equals the\r\ncapacity for transportation. Whenever the load reduces the downward\r\ncorrasion to little or nothing, lateral corrasion becomes relatively and\r\nactually of importance. The first result of the wearing of the walls of\r\na stream’s channel is the formation of a flood-plain. As an effect of\r\nmomentum the current is always swiftest along the outside of a curve of\r\nthe channel, and it is there that the wearing is performed; while at the\r\ninner side of the curve the current is so slow that part of the load is\r\ndeposited. In this way the width of the channel remains the same while\r\nits position is shifted, and every part of the valley which it has\r\ncrossed in its shiftings comes to be covered by a deposit which does not\r\nrise above the highest level of the water. The surface of this deposit\r\nis hence appropriately called the _flood-plain_ of the stream. The\r\ndeposit is of nearly uniform depth, descending no lower than the bottom\r\nof the water-channel, and it rests upon a tolerably even surface of the\r\nrock or other material which is corraded by the stream. The process of\r\ncarving away the rock so as to produce an even surface, and at the same\r\ntime covering it with an alluvial deposit, is the process of\r\n_planation_.\r\n\r\nIt sometimes happens that two adjacent streams by extending their areas\r\nof planation eat through the dividing ridge and join their channels. The\r\nstream which has the higher surface at the point of contact, quickly\r\nabandons the lower part of its channel and becomes a branch of the\r\nother, having shifted its course by planation.\r\n\r\nThe slopes of the Henry Mountains illustrate the process in a peculiarly\r\nstriking manner. The streams which flow down them are limited in their\r\nrate of degradation at both ends. At their sources, erosion is opposed\r\nby the hardness of the rocks; the trachytes and metamorphics of the\r\nmountain tops are carved very slowly. At their mouths, they discharge\r\ninto the Colorado and the Dirty Devil, and cannot sink their channels\r\nmore rapidly than do those rivers. Between the mountains and the rivers,\r\nthey cross rocks which are soft in comparison with the trachyte, but\r\nthey can deepen their channels with no greater rapidity than at their\r\nends. The grades have adjusted themselves accordingly. Among the hard\r\nrocks of the mountains the declivities are great, so as to give\r\nefficiency to the eroding water. Among the sedimentary rocks of the base\r\nthey are small in comparison, the chief work of the streams being the\r\ntransportation of the trachyte _débris_. So greatly are the streams\r\nconcerned in transportation, and so little in downward corrasion\r\n(outside the trachyte region), that their grades are almost unaffected\r\nby the differences of rock texture, and they pass through sandstone and\r\nshale with nearly the same declivity.\r\n\r\nThe rate of downward corrasion being thus limited by extraneous\r\nconditions, and the instrument of corrasion—the _débris_ of the hard\r\ntrachyte—being efficient, lateral corrasion is limited only by the\r\nresistance which the banks of the streams oppose. Where the material of\r\nthe banks is a firm sandstone, narrow flood-plains are formed; and where\r\nit is a shale, broad ones. In the Gray Cliff and Vermilion Cliff\r\nsandstones flat-bottomed cañons are excavated; but in the great shale\r\nbeds broad valleys are opened, and the flood-plains of adjacent streams\r\ncoalesce to form continuous plains. The broadest plains are as a rule\r\ncarved from the thickest beds of shale, and these are found at the top\r\nof the Jura-Trias and near the base of the Cretaceous. Where the streams\r\nfrom the mountains cross the Blue Gate, the Tununk, or the Flaming Gorge\r\nshale at a favorable angle, a plain is the result.\r\n\r\nThe plain which lies at the southern and western bases of Mount Hillers\r\nis carved chiefly from the Tununk shale (see Figure 27). The plain\r\nsloping eastward from Mount Pennell (Figure 36) is carved from the Blue\r\nGate and Tununk shales. The Lewis Creek plain, which lies at the western\r\nbase of Mount Ellen, is formed from the Blue Gate, Tununk, and Masuk\r\nshales, and the planation which produced it has so perfectly truncated\r\nthe Tununk and Blue Gate sandstones that their outcrops cannot be traced\r\n(Figures 61, 39, and 42). The plain which truncates the Crescent arch\r\n(Figure 49) is carved in chief part from the Flaming Gorge shale. Toward\r\nthe east it is limited by the outcrops of the Henry’s Fork conglomerate,\r\nbut toward the mountain it cuts across the edge of the same conglomerate\r\nand extends over Tununk shale to the margin of the trachyte.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 61.—Cross-section of the Lewis Creek Plain.

HF, Henry’s Fork conglomerate.\r\n    Scale, 1 inch = 4,000 feet.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe streams which made these plains and which maintain them, accomplish\r\ntheir work by a continual shifting of their channels; and where the\r\nplains are best developed they employ another method of shifting—a\r\nmethod which in its proper logical order must be treated in the\r\ndiscussion of alluvial cones, but which is practically combined in the\r\nHenry Mountains with the method of planation. The supply of detritus\r\nderived from the erosion of the trachyte is not entirely constant. Not\r\nonly is more carried out in one season than another and in one year than\r\nanother, but the work is accomplished in part by sudden storms which\r\ncreate great floods and as suddenly cease. It results from this\r\nirregularity that the channels are sometimes choked by _débris_, and\r\nthat by the choking of the channels the streams are turned aside to seek\r\nnew courses upon the general plain. The abandoned courses remain plainly\r\nmarked, and one who looks down on them from some commanding eminence can\r\noften trace out many stages in the history of the drainage. Where a\r\nseries of streams emerge from adjacent mountain gorges upon a common\r\nplain, their shiftings bring about frequent unions and separations, and\r\nproduce a variety of combinations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 62.—Ideal sketch to illustrate the Shifting of waterways on a\r\n    slope of Planation.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe accompanying sketch, Figure 62, is not from nature, but it serves to\r\nillustrate the character of the changes. The streams which issue from\r\nthe mountain gorges _a_ and _b_ join and flow to _z_; while that which\r\nissues at _c_ flows alone to _x_. An abandoned channel, _n_, shows that\r\nthe stream from _b_ was formerly united with that from _c_, and flowed\r\nto _x_; and another channel, _m_, shows that it has at some time\r\nmaintained an independent course to _y_. By such shiftings streams are\r\nsometimes changed from one drainage system to another; the hypothetical\r\ncourses, _x_, _y_, and _z_, may lead to different rivers, and to\r\ndifferent oceans.\r\n\r\nAn instance occurs on the western flank of the mountains. One of the\r\nprincipal heads of Pine Alcove Creek rises on the south slope of Mount\r\nEllen and another on the northwest slope of Mount Pennell. The two unite\r\nand flow southward to the Colorado River. They do not now cross an area\r\nof planation, but at an earlier stage of the degradation they did; and\r\nthe portions of that plain which survive, indicate by the direction of\r\ntheir slopes that one or both of the streams may have then discharged\r\nits water into Lewis Creek, which runs northward to the Dirty Devil\r\nRiver.\r\n\r\nAs the general degradation of the region progresses the streams and\r\ntheir plains sink lower, and eventually each plain is sunk completely\r\nthrough the shale whose softness made it possible. So soon as the\r\nstreams reach harder rock their lateral corrasion is checked, and they\r\nare no longer free to change their ways. Wherever they chance to run at\r\nthat time, there they stay and carve for themselves cañons. Portions of\r\nthe deserted plains remain between the cañons, and having a durable\r\ncapping of trachyte gravel are long preserved. Such stranded fragments\r\nabound on the slopes of the mountains, and in them one may read many\r\npages of the history of the degradation. They form tabular hills with\r\nsloping tops and even profiles. The top of each hill is covered with a\r\nuniform layer of gravel, beneath which the solid rock is smoothly\r\ntruncated. The slope of the hill depends on the grade of the ancient\r\nstream, and is independent of the hardness and dip of the strata.\r\n\r\nThe illustration represents a _hill of planation_ on the north slope of\r\nMount Ellsworth. It is built of the Gray Cliff sandstone and Flaming\r\nGorge shale, inclined at angles varying from 25° to 45°; but\r\nnotwithstanding their variety of texture and dip the edges of the strata\r\nare evenly cut away, so that their upper surface constitutes a plane.\r\nThe stream which performed this truncation afterward cut deeper into the\r\nstrata and carved the lower table which forms the foreground of the\r\nsketch. It has now abandoned this plain also and flows through a still\r\ndeeper channel on the opposite side of the hill.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 63.—A Hill of Planation.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe phenomena of planation are further illustrated in the region which\r\nlies to the northwest of the Henry Mountains. Tantalus and Temple\r\nCreeks, rising under the edge of the Aquarius Plateau, transport the\r\ntrachyte of the plateau across the region of the Waterpocket flexure to\r\nthe Dirty Devil River. Their flood-plains are not now of great extent,\r\nbut when their drainage lines ran a few hundred feet higher they appear\r\nto have carved into a single plain a broad exposure of the Flaming Gorge\r\nshale, which then lay between the Waterpocket and Blue Gate flexures.\r\n\r\nAt the Red Gate where the Dirty Devil River passes from a district of\r\ntrachyte plateaus to the district of the Great Flexures, it follows for\r\na few miles the outcrop of the Shinarump shale, and the remnants of its\r\nabandoned flood-plains form a series of terraces upon each bank. Small\r\nstreams from the sides have cut across the benches and displayed their\r\nstructure. Each one is carved from the rock _in situ_, but each is\r\ncovered by a layer of the rounded river gravel. The whole are results of\r\nplanation; and they serve to connect the somewhat peculiar features of\r\nthe mountain slopes with the ordinary terraces of rivers.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 64.—Ideal cross-section of a Terraced River Valley, after\r\n    Hitchcock. A, B, C, D, E, and F, Alluvial deposits. G, Indurated\r\n    rock, _in situ_.\r\n]\r\n\r\nRiver terraces as a rule are carved out, and not built up. They are\r\nalways the vestiges of flood-plains, and flood-plains are usually\r\nproduced by lateral corrasion. There are instances, especially near the\r\nsea-coast, of river-plains which have originated by the silting up of\r\nvalleys, and have been afterward partially destroyed by the same rivers\r\nwhen some change of level permitted them to cut their channels deeper;\r\nand these instances, conspiring with the fact that the surfaces of\r\nflood-plains are alluvial, and with the fact that many terraces in\r\nglacial regions are carved from unconsolidated drift, have led some\r\nAmerican geologists into the error of supposing that river terraces in\r\ngeneral are the records of sedimentation, when in fact they record the\r\nstages of a progressive corrasion. The ideal section of a terraced river\r\nvalley which I reproduce from Hitchcock (Surface Geology, Plate XII,\r\nfigure 1) regards each terrace as the remnant of a separate deposit,\r\nbuilt up from the bottom of the valley. To illustrate my own idea I have\r\ncopied his profile (Figure 65) and interpreted its features as the\r\nresults of lateral corrasion or planation, giving each bench a capping\r\nof alluvium, but constituting it otherwise of the preëxistent material\r\nof the valley. The preëxistent material in the region of the Henry\r\nMountains is always rock _in situ_, but in the Northern States it often\r\nincludes glacial drift, modified or unmodified.\r\n\r\nThere is a kindred error, as I conceive, involved in the assumption that\r\nthe streams which occupied the upper and broader flood-plains of a\r\nvalley were greater than those which have succeeded them. They may have\r\nbeen, or they may not. In the process of lateral corrasion all the\r\nmaterial that is worn from the bank has to be transported by the water,\r\nand where the bank is high the work proceeds less rapidly than where it\r\nis low. A stream which degrades its immediate valley more rapidly than\r\nthe surrounding country is degraded (and the streams which abound in\r\nterraces are of this character) steadily increases the height of the\r\nbanks which must be excavated in planation and diminishes the extent of\r\nits flood-plain; and this might occur even if the volume of the stream\r\nwas progressively increasing instead of diminishing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 65.—Ideal cross-section of a Terraced River Valley, regarded as a\r\n    result of Planation. A, B, C, &c., Alluvial deposits. G, Preëxistent\r\n    material from which the valley was excavated.\r\n]\r\n\r\nOf the same order also is the mistake, occasionally made of ignoring the\r\nexcavation which a stream has performed, and assuming that when the\r\nupper terraces were made the valley was as open as at present, and the\r\nvolume of flowing water was great enough to fill it.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           _Alluvial Cones._\r\n\r\nWherever a stream is engaged in deposition instead of corrasion—wherever\r\nit deposits its load—there is a shifting of channel by a third process.\r\nThe deposition of sediment takes place upon the bottom of the channel\r\nand upon its immediate banks, and this continues until the channel\r\nbottom is higher than the adjacent country. The wall of the channel is\r\nthen broken through at some point, and the water abandons its old bed\r\nfor one which is lower. Such occurrences belong to the histories of all\r\nriver deltas, and the devastation they have wrought at the mouths of\r\nlarge rivers has enforced attention to their phenomena and stimulated a\r\nstudy of their causes.\r\n\r\nThe same thing happens among the mountains. Wherever, as in Nevada and\r\nWestern Utah, the valleys are the receptacles of the detritus washed out\r\nfrom the mountains, the foot-slopes of the mountains consist of a series\r\nof alluvial cones. From each mountain gorge the products of its erosion\r\nare discharged into the valley. The stream which bears the _débris_\r\nbuilds up the bed of its channel until it is higher than the adjacent\r\nland and then abandons it, and by the repetition of this process\r\naccumulates a conical hill of detritus which slopes equally in all\r\ndirections from the mouth of the mountain gorge. At one time or another\r\nthe water runs over every part of the cone and leaves it by every part\r\nof its base; and it sometimes happens that the opposite slopes of the\r\ncone lead to different drainage systems.\r\n\r\nAn illustration may be seen in Red Rock Pass at the north end of Cache\r\nValley, Idaho. Lake Bonneville, the ancient expansion of Great Salt\r\nLake,[6] here found outlet to the basin of the Columbia, and the channel\r\ncarved by its water is plainly marked. For a distance of twelve miles\r\nthe bed of the channel is nearly level, with a width of a thousand feet.\r\nMidway, Marsh Creek enters it from the east, and has built an alluvial\r\ncone which extends to the opposite bank and divides it into two parts.\r\nIn the construction of the cone Marsh Creek has flowed alternately to\r\nthe north and to the south, being in one case a tributary to the Snake\r\nand Columbia Rivers and to the Pacific Ocean, and in the other to the\r\nBear River and Great Salt Lake. So far as the creek is known to white\r\nmen it is a tributary of the Snake, but an irrigating ditch that has\r\nbeen dug upon its cone carries part of its water to the Bear.\r\n\r\nFootnote 6:\r\n\r\n  Lake Bonneville is described in volume III (Geology) of the “U. S.\r\n  Geog. Surveys West of the 100th Meridian,” pp. 88–104; and less fully\r\n  in the American Naturalist for November, 1876, and the American\r\n  Journal of Science for March, 1876, p. 228. See also Johnson’s\r\n  Cyclopedia, article “Sevier Lake.”\r\n\r\nAnother illustration exists at the mouth of the Colorado River. As has\r\nbeen shown by Blake in the fifth volume of the Pacific Railroad Reports\r\n(p. 236), the delta of the Colorado—or in other words the alluvial cone\r\nwhich is built at its mouth—has extended itself completely across the\r\nGulf of California, severing the upper end from the lower and from the\r\nocean, and converting it into a lake. In continuing the upbuilding of\r\nthe delta the river has flowed alternately into the lower gulf and into\r\nits severed segment. At the present day its mouth opens to the lower\r\ngulf; but at rare intervals a portion of its water runs by the channel\r\nknown as “New River” to the opposite side of the delta. While it is\r\nabandoned by the river the lake basin is dry, and it is known to human\r\nhistory only as the Colorado Desert. Its bottom, which is lower than the\r\nsurface of the ocean, is strewn with the remains of the life its waters\r\nsustained, and its beaches are patiently awaiting the cycle of change\r\nwhich is slowly but surely preparing to restore to them their parent\r\nwaves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 66.—Cross-section of inclined strata, to illustrate Monoclinal\r\n    Shifting of waterways.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                         _Monoclinal Shifting._\r\n\r\nIn a fourth manner drainage lines are unstable.\r\n\r\nIn a region of inclined strata there is a tendency on the part of\r\nstreams which traverse soft beds to continue therein, and there is a\r\ntendency to eliminate drainage lines from hard beds. In Figure 66, _S_\r\nrepresents a homogeneous soft bed, and _H_ and _K_, homogeneous hard\r\nbeds. _A_ and _B_ are streams flowing through channels opened in the\r\nsoft rock, and in the hard. As the general degradation progresses the\r\nstream at _a_ abrades both sides of its channel with equal force; but it\r\nfails to corrade them at equal rates because of the inequality of the\r\nresistance. It results that the channel does not cut its way vertically\r\ninto the hard rock, but works obliquely downward without changing its\r\nrelation to the two beds; so that when the degradation has reached the\r\nstage indicated by the dotted line, the stream flows at _a_, having been\r\nshifted horizontally by circumstances dependent on the dip and order of\r\nthe strata.\r\n\r\nAt the same time the stream at _B_, encountering homogeneous material,\r\ncuts its way vertically downward to _b_; and a continuance of the\r\nprocess carries it completely through the hard rock and into the soft.\r\nOnce in the soft it tends like the other streams to remain there; and in\r\nthe course of time it finds its way to the lower edge and establishes a\r\nchannel like that at _A_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 67.—Ground plan of outcrops of inclined strata, to illustrate the\r\n    results of Monoclinal Shifting.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe effect of this process on the course of a stream which runs\r\nobliquely across inclined beds is shown in Figure 67. The outcrops of a\r\nseries of hard and soft strata, _H_, _H_, _H_ and _S_, _S_, are\r\nrepresented in ground plan, and the direction of their dip is indicated\r\nby the arrow. Supposing that a stream is thrown across them in the\r\ndirection of the dotted lines and that the land is then degraded, the\r\nfollowing changes will take place. The portion of the stream from _c_ to\r\n_d_ will sink through the soft rock down to the surface of the hard, and\r\nthen follow down the slope of the hard, until at last its whole course\r\nwill be transferred to the line of separation between the two, and its\r\nposition (with reference to the outcrops which will then have succeeded\r\nthe original) will be represented by the line _g c_. The portion from\r\n_e_ to _d_ sinking first through the hard bed and then through the soft,\r\nwill be deflected in the same manner to the position _e h g_. The points\r\n_e_ and _c_ will retain their original relations to the strata. The same\r\nchanges will affect the portion from _e_ to _f_; and the original\r\noblique course will be converted into two sets of courses, of which one\r\nwill follow the strike of the strata and the other will cross the strike\r\nat right angles.\r\n\r\nThe character of these changes is independent of the direction of the\r\ncurrent. They are not individually of great amount, and they do not\r\noften divert streams from one drainage system to another nor change\r\ntheir general directions. Their chief effects are seen in the details of\r\ndrainage systems and in the production of topographic forms. The\r\ntendency of hard strata to rid themselves of waterways and of soft\r\nstrata to accumulate them, is a prime element of the process which\r\ncarves hills from the hard and valleys from the soft. Where hard rocks\r\nare crossed by waterways they cannot stand higher than the adjacent\r\nparts of the waterways; but where they are not so crossed they become\r\ndivides, and the “law of divides” conspires with the “law of structure”\r\nto carve eminences from them.\r\n\r\nThe tendency of waterways to escape from hard strata and to abide in\r\nsoft, and their tendency to follow the strike of soft strata and to\r\ncross hard at right angles, are tendencies only and do not always\r\nprevail. They are opposed by the tendency of drainage lines to\r\nstability. If the dip of the strata is small, or if the differences of\r\nhardness are slight, or if the changes of texture are gradual instead of\r\nabrupt, monoclinal shifting is greatly reduced.\r\n\r\nWaterpocket Cañon is one of the most remarkable of monoclinal valleys;\r\nand it serves to illustrate both the rule of monoclinal shifting and its\r\nexception. The principal bed of soft rock which outcrops along the line\r\nof the Waterpocket flexure is the Flaming Gorge shale, having a\r\nthickness of more than one thousand feet. Through nearly the whole\r\nextent of the outcrop a valley is carved from it, but the valley is not\r\na unit in drainage. At the north it is crossed by the Dirty Devil River\r\nand by Temple and Tantalus Creeks, and the adjacent portions slope\r\ntoward those streams. At the south it is occupied for thirty miles by a\r\nsingle waterway—the longest monoclinal drainage line with which I am\r\nacquainted. The valley here bears the name of Waterpocket Cañon, and\r\ndescends all the way from the Masuk Plateau to the Colorado River. The\r\nupper part of the cañon is dry except in time of rain, but the lower\r\ncarries a perpetual stream known as Hoxie Creek. Whatever may have been\r\nthe original meanderings of the latter they are now restrained, and it\r\nis limited to the narrow belt in which the shale outcrops. As the cañon\r\nis worn deeper the channel steadily shifts its position down the slope\r\nof the underlying Gray Cliff sandstone, and carves away the shale. But\r\nthere is one exceptional point where it has not done this. When the\r\nbottom of the cañon was a thousand feet higher the creek failed, at a\r\nplace where the dip of the strata was comparatively small, to shift its\r\nchannel as it deepened it, and began to cut its way into the massive\r\nsandstone. Having once entered the hard rock it could not retreat but\r\nsank deeper and deeper, carving a narrow gorge through which it still\r\nruns making a detour from the main valley. The traveler who follows down\r\nWaterpocket Cañon now comes to a place where the creek turns from the\r\nopen cañon of the shale and enters a dark cleft in the sandstone. He can\r\nfollow the course of the water (on foot), and will be repaid for the\r\nwetting of his feet by the strange beauty of the defile. For nearly\r\nthree miles he will thread his way through a gorge walled in by the\r\nsmooth, curved faces of the massive sandstone, and so narrow and devious\r\nthat it is gloomy for lack of sunlight; and then he will emerge once\r\nmore into the open cañon. Or if he prefer he can keep to his saddle, to\r\nthe open daylight, and to the outcrop of the shale, and riding over a\r\nlow divide can reach the mouth of the gorge in half the distance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 68.—Waterpocket Cañon and the Horseshoe Bend of Hoxie Creek.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE STABILITY OF DIVIDES.\r\n\r\nThe rain drops which fall upon the two sides of a divide flow in\r\nopposite directions. However near to the dividing line they reach the\r\nearth the work of each is apportioned to its own slope. It disintegrates\r\nand transports the material of its own drainage slope only. The divide\r\nis the line across which no water flows—across which there is no\r\ntransportation. It receives the minimum of water, for it has only that\r\nwhich falls directly upon it, and every other point receives in addition\r\nthat which flows from higher points. It is higher than the surfaces\r\nwhich adjoin it, and since less water is applied to its degradation it\r\ntends to remain higher. It tends to maintain its position.\r\n\r\nOpposed to this tendency there are others which lead to\r\n\r\n\r\n                      THE INSTABILITY OF DIVIDES,\r\n\r\nand which will now be considered.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 _Ponding, Planation, and Alluviation._\r\n\r\nWhenever by ponding, a stream or a system of streams which have belonged\r\nto one drainage system are diverted so as to join another there is\r\ncoincidently a change of divides. The general divide between the two\r\nsystems is shifted from one side to the other of the area which changes\r\nits allegiance. The line which was formerly the main divide becomes\r\ninstead a subordinate divide separating portions of the drainage system\r\nwhich has increased its area; and on the other hand a line which had\r\nbeen a subordinate divide is promoted to the rank of a main divide. In\r\nlike manner the shifting of streams from one system of drainage to\r\nanother by the extension of flood-plains, or by the building of alluvial\r\ncones or deltas, involves a simultaneous shifting of the divides which\r\nbound the drainage systems.\r\n\r\nThe changes which are produced by these methods are per saltum. When a\r\npond or lake opens a new outlet and abandons its old one there is a\r\nshort interregnum during which the drainage is divided between the two\r\noutlets, and the watershed separating the drainage systems is double.\r\nBut in no other sense is the change gradual. The divide occupies no\r\nintermediate positions between its original and its final. And the same\r\nmay be said of the changes by planation and alluviation. In each case a\r\ntract of country is transferred bodily from one river system to another,\r\nand in each case the watershed makes a leap.\r\n\r\nBut there are other methods of change, by which dividing lines move\r\n_slowly_ across the land; and to these we will proceed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         _Monoclinal Shifting._\r\n\r\nIn regions of inclined strata, the same process which gathers the\r\nwaterways into the outcrops of the softer beds converts the outcrops of\r\nthe harder into divides. As the degradation progresses the waterways and\r\ndivides descend obliquely and retain the same relations to the beds. The\r\nwaterways continuously select the soft because they resist erosion\r\nfeebly, and the watersheds as continuously select the hard because they\r\nresist erosion strongly. If the inclination of the strata is gentle,\r\neach hard bed becomes the cap of a sloping table bounded by a cliff, and\r\nthe erosion of the cliff is by sapping. The divide is at the brow of the\r\ncliff, and as successive fragments of the hard rock break away and roll\r\ndown the slope the divide is shifted. The process is illustrated in the\r\nPink Cliffs of Southern Utah. They face to the south, and their\r\nescarpment is drained by streams flowing to the Colorado. The table\r\nwhich they limit inclines to the north and bears the headwaters of the\r\nSevier. As the erosion of the cliffs steadily carries them back and\r\nrestricts the table, the drainage area of the Colorado is increased and\r\nthat of the “Great Basin”, to which the Sevier River is tributary, is\r\ndiminished.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 69.—Ideal cross-section of inclined strata, to show the Shifting\r\n    of Divides in Cliff Erosion. Successive positions of a divide are\r\n    indicated at _a_, _b_, and _c_.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                    _Unequal and Equal Declivities._\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 70.—Cross-profile of a bad-land divide separating slopes of\r\n    Unequal Declivity. Two stages of erosion are indicated, to\r\n    illustrate the horizontal shifting of the divide.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn homogeneous material, and with equal quantities of water, the rate of\r\nerosion of two slopes depends upon their declivities. The steeper is\r\ndegraded the faster. It is evident that when the two slopes are upon\r\nopposite sides of a divide the more rapid wearing of the steeper carries\r\nthe divide toward the side of the gentler. The action ceases and the\r\ndivide becomes stationary only when the profile of the divide has been\r\nrendered symmetric.\r\n\r\nIt is to this law that bad-lands owe much of their beauty. They acquire\r\ntheir smooth curves under what I have called the “law of divides”, but\r\nthe symmetry of each ridge and each spur is due to the law of equal\r\ndeclivities. By the law of divides all the slopes upon one side of a\r\nridge are made interdependent. By the law of equal declivities a\r\nrelation is established between the slopes which adjoin the crest on\r\nopposite sides, and by this means the slopes of the whole ridge, from\r\nbase to base, are rendered interdependent.\r\n\r\nOne result of the interdependence of slopes is that a bad-land ridge\r\nseparating two waterways which have the same level, stands midway\r\nbetween them; while a ridge separating two waterways which have\r\ndifferent levels, stands nearer to the one which is higher.\r\n\r\nIt results also that if one of the waterways is corraded more rapidly\r\nthan the other the divide moves steadily toward the latter, and\r\neventually, if the process continues, reaches it. When this occurs, the\r\nstream with the higher valley abandons the lower part of its course and\r\njoins its water to that of the lower stream. Thus from the shifting of\r\ndivides there arises yet another method of the shifting of waterways, a\r\nmethod which it will be convenient to characterize as that of\r\n_abstraction_. A stream which for any reason is able to corrade its\r\nbottom more rapidly than do its neighbors, expands its valley at their\r\nexpense, and eventually “abstracts” them. And conversely, a stream which\r\nfor any reason is able to corrade its bottom less rapidly than its\r\nneighbors, has its valley contracted by their encroachments and is\r\neventually “abstracted” by one or the other.\r\n\r\nThe diverse circumstances which may lead to these results need not be\r\nenumerated, but there is one case which is specially noteworthy on\r\naccount of its relation to the principles of sculpture. Suppose that two\r\nstreams which run parallel and near to each other corrade the same\r\nmaterial and degrade their channels at the same rate. Their divide will\r\nrun midway. But if in the course of time one of the streams encounters a\r\npeculiarly hard mass of rock while the other does not, its rate of\r\ncorrasion above the obstruction will be checked. The unobstructed stream\r\nwill outstrip it, will encroach upon its valley, and will at last\r\nabstract it; and the incipient corrasion of the hard mass will be\r\nstopped. Thus by abstraction as well as by monoclinal shifting, streams\r\nare eliminated from hard rocks.\r\n\r\n_Résumé._—There is a tendency to permanence on the part of drainage\r\nlines and divides, and they are not displaced without adequate cause.\r\nHence every change which is known to occur demands and admits of an\r\nexplanation.\r\n\r\n(_a_) There are four ways in which abrupt changes are made. Streams are\r\ndiverted from one drainage system to another, and the watersheds which\r\nseparate the systems are rearranged,\r\n\r\n  (1) by _ponding_, due to the elevation or depression of portions of\r\n        the land;\r\n\r\n  (2) by _planation_, or the extension of flood-plains by lateral\r\n        corrasion;\r\n\r\n  (3) by _alluviation_, or in the process of building alluvial cones and\r\n        deltas; and\r\n\r\n  (4) by _abstraction_.\r\n\r\n(_b_) There are two ways in which gradual changes are effected:\r\n\r\n  (1) When the rock texture is variable, it modifies and controls by\r\n        _monoclinal shifting_ the distribution in detail of divides and\r\n        waterways.\r\n\r\n  (2) When the rock texture is uniform, the positions of divides\r\n        are adjusted in accordance with the principle of _equal\r\n        declivities_.\r\n\r\nThe abrupt changes are of geographic import; the gradual, of\r\ntopographic.\r\n\r\nThe methods which have been enumerated are not the only ones by which\r\ndrainage systems are modified, but they are the chief. Very rarely\r\nstreams are “ponded” and diverted to new courses through the damming of\r\ntheir valleys by glaciers or by volcanic _ejecta_ or by land-slips. More\r\nfrequently they are obstructed by the growing alluvial cones of stronger\r\nstreams, but only the smallest streams will yield their “right of way”\r\nfor such cause, and the results are insignificant.\r\n\r\nThe rotation of the earth, just as it gives direction to the trade-winds\r\nand to ocean currents, tends to deflect rivers. In the southern\r\nhemisphere streams are crowded against their left banks and in northern\r\nagainst the right. But this influence is exceedingly small. Mr. Ferrel’s\r\ninvestigations show that in latitude 45° and for a current velocity of\r\nten miles an hour, it is measured by less than one twenty-thousandth\r\npart of the weight of the water (American Journal of Science, January,\r\n1861). If its effects are ever appreciable it must be where lateral\r\ncorrasion is rapid; and even there it is probable that the chief result\r\nis an inclination of the flood-plain toward one bank or the other,\r\namounting at most to two or three minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 CONSEQUENT AND INCONSEQUENT DRAINAGE.\r\n\r\nIf a series of sediments accumulated in an ocean or lake be subjected to\r\na system of displacements while still under water, and then be converted\r\nto dry land by elevation _en masse_ or by the retirement of the water,\r\nthe rains which fall on them will inaugurate a drainage system perfectly\r\nconformable with the system of displacements. Streams will rise along\r\nthe crest of each anticlinal, will flow from it in the direction of the\r\nsteepest dip, will unite in the synclinals, and will follow them\r\nlengthwise. The axis of each synclinal will be marked by a watercourse;\r\nthe axis of each anticlinal by a watershed. Such a system is said to be\r\n_consequent_ on the structure.\r\n\r\nIf however a rock series is affected by a system of displacements after\r\nthe series has become continental, it will have already acquired a\r\nsystem of waterways, and _provided the displacements are produced\r\nslowly_ the waters will not be diverted from their accustomed ways. The\r\neffect of local elevation will be to stimulate local corrasion, and each\r\nriver that crosses a line of uplift will inch by inch as the land rises\r\ndeepen its channel and valorously maintain its original course. It will\r\nresult that the directions of the drainage lines will be independent of\r\nthe displacements. Such a drainage system is said to be _antecedent_ to\r\nthe structure.\r\n\r\nBut if in the latter case the displacements are produced rapidly the\r\ndrainage system will be rearranged and will become consequent to the\r\nstructure. It has frequently happened that displacements formed with\r\nmoderate rapidity have given rise to a drainage system of mixed\r\ncharacter in which the courses of the larger streams are antecedent and\r\nthose of the smaller are consequent.\r\n\r\nThere is a fourth case. Suppose a rock series that has been folded and\r\neroded to be again submerged, and to receive a new accumulation of\r\nunconforming sediments. Suppose further that it once more emerges and\r\nthat the new sediments are eroded from its surface. Then the drainage\r\nsystem will have been given by the form of the upper surface of the\r\nsuperior strata, but will be independent of the structure of the\r\ninferior series, into which it will descend vertically as the\r\ndegradation progresses. Such a drainage system is said to be\r\n_superimposed by sedimentation_ upon the structure of the older series\r\nof strata.\r\n\r\nFifth. The drainage of an alluvial cone or of a delta is independent of\r\nthe structure of the bed-rock beneath; and if in the course of time\r\nerosion takes the place of deposition and the alluvial formation is cut\r\nthrough, the drainage system which is acquired by the rocks beneath is\r\nnot consequent upon their structure but is _superimposed by\r\nalluviation_.\r\n\r\nSixth. The drainage of a district of planation is independent of the\r\nstructure of the rock from which it is carved; and when in the progress\r\nof degradation the beds favorable to lateral corrasion are destroyed and\r\nthe waterways become permanent, their system may be said to be\r\n_superimposed by planation_.\r\n\r\nIn brief, systems of drainage, in their relation to structure, are\r\n\r\n  (A) _consequent_\r\n\r\n  (a) by emergence, when the displacements are subaqueous, and\r\n\r\n  (b) by sudden displacement;\r\n\r\n  (B) _antecedent_; and\r\n\r\n  (C) _superimposed_\r\n\r\n  (a) by sedimentation, or subaqueous deposition,\r\n\r\n  (b) by alluviation, or subaërial deposition, and\r\n\r\n  (c) by planation.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  THE DRAINAGE OF THE HENRY MOUNTAINS\r\n\r\nis consequent on the laccolitic displacements. The uplifting of a\r\nlaccolite, like the upbuilding of a volcanic cone, is an event of so\r\nrapid progress that the corrasion of a stream bed cannot keep pace with\r\nit. We do not know that the site of the mountains was dry land at the\r\ntime of their elevation; but if it was, then whatever streams crossed it\r\nwere obstructed and turned from their courses. If it was not, there were\r\nno preëxistent waterways, and the new ones, formed by the first rain\r\nwhich fell upon the domes of strata, radiated from the crests in all\r\ndirections. The result in either case would be the same, and we cannot\r\ndetermine from the present drainage system whether the domes were lifted\r\nfrom the bed of the Tertiary lake or arose after its subsidence.\r\n\r\nBut while the drainage of the Henry Mountains is consequent as a whole,\r\nit is not consequent in all its details, and the character of its\r\npartial inconsequence is worthy of examination.\r\n\r\nLet us begin with the simplest case. The drainage system of Mount\r\nEllsworth is more purely consequent than any other with which I am\r\nacquainted. In the accompanying chart the point _c_ marks the crest of\r\nthe Ellsworth dome; the inner circle represents the line of maximum dip\r\nof the arching strata and the outer circle the limit of the disturbance.\r\nIt will be seen that all the waterways radiate from the crest and follow\r\nclosely the directions in which the strata incline. At _a_ the Ellsworth\r\narch touches that of Mount Holmes and at _b_ that of Mount Hillers; and\r\nthe effect of the compound inclination is to modify the directions of a\r\nfew of the waterways.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 71.—Drainage system of the Ellsworth Arch.\r\n]\r\n\r\nTurning now to Mount Holmes, we find that its two domes are not equally\r\nrespected by the drainage lines. The crest of the Greater arch (see\r\nFigure 72) is the center of a radiating system, but the crest of the\r\nLesser arch is not; and waterways arising on the Greater traverse the\r\nLesser from side to side. More than this, a waterway after following the\r\nmargin of the Lesser arch turns toward it and penetrates the flank of\r\nthe arch for some distance. In a word, the drainage of the Greater arch\r\nis consequent on the structure, while the drainage of the Lesser arch is\r\ninconsequent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 72.—Drainage system of the Holmes Arches.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThere are at least two ways in which this state of affairs may have\r\narisen.\r\n\r\nFirst, the Greater arch may have been lifted so long before the Lesser\r\nthat its waterways were carved too deeply to be diverted by the gentle\r\nflexure of the latter. The drainage of the Lesser would in that case be\r\nclassed as antecedent. If the Lesser arch were first formed and carved,\r\nthe lifting of the Greater might throw a stream across its summit; but\r\nit could not initiate the waterways which skirt the slopes of the\r\nLesser, especially if those slopes were already furrowed by streams\r\nwhich descended them. If the establishment of the drainage system\r\ndepended on the order of uplift, the Greater arch is surely the older.\r\n\r\nSecond, the drainage of the Lesser arch may have been imposed upon it by\r\nplanation at a very late stage of the degradation. Whatever was the\r\norigin of the arches, and whatever was the depth of cover which they\r\nsustained, the Greater is certain to have been a center of drainage from\r\nthe time of its formation. When it was first lifted it became a drainage\r\ncenter because it was an eminence; and afterward it remained an eminence\r\nbecause it was a drainage center. When in the progress of the denudation\r\nits dikes were exposed, their hardness checked the wear of the summit\r\nand its eminence became more pronounced. It was perhaps at about this\r\ntime that the last of the Cretaceous rocks were removed from the summits\r\nand slopes of the two arches and the Flaming Gorge shale was laid bare,\r\nand so soon as this occurred the conditions for lateral corrasion were\r\ncomplete. With trachyte in the peaks and shale upon the slopes planation\r\nwould naturally result, and a drainage system would be arranged about\r\nthe dikes as a center without regard to the curves of the strata. The\r\nsubsequent removal of the shale would impart its drainage to the\r\nunderlying sandstones.\r\n\r\nEither hypothesis is competent to explain the facts, but the data do not\r\nwarrant the adoption of one to the exclusion of the other. The waterways\r\nof the Lesser arch may be either antecedent, or superimposed by\r\nplanation. The Greater arch may have been the first to rise or the last.\r\n\r\nThe drainage of Mount Hillers is consequent to the main uplift and to\r\nthe majority of the minor, but to the Pulpit arch it is inconsequent. In\r\nthis case there is no question that the arch has been truncated by\r\nplanation. (Figure 73.) The Hillers dome, rising five times as high as\r\nthe Pulpit, became the center of drainage for the cluster, and the\r\ntrachyte-laden streams which it sent forth were able to pare away\r\ncompletely the lower arch while it was still unprotected by the hardness\r\nof its nucleus. The foot-plain of Mount Hillers, which extends unbroken\r\nto the outcrop of the Henry’s Fork conglomerate, is continued on several\r\nlines across the Pulpit arch, although in the intervals the central area\r\nis deeply excavated. The planation stage is just completed, and an epoch\r\nof fixed waterways is inaugurated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 73.—Cross-section of the Pulpit Arch, showing its truncation.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe drainage of Mount Pennell is consequent in regard to the main\r\nuplift, but inconsequent to some of the minor. A stream which rises on\r\nthe north flank not merely runs across one of the upper series of\r\nlaccolites,—a companion to the Sentinel,—but has cut into it and divided\r\nit nearly to the base. It is probable that the position of the waterway\r\nwas fixed by planation, but no remnant of the plain was seen.\r\n\r\nToo little is known of the structure of the central area of Mount Ellen\r\nto assert its relation to the drainage. About its base there are five\r\nlaccolites which have lost all or nearly all their cover, and each of\r\nthese is a local center of drainage, avoided by the streams which head\r\nin the mountain crest. Four others have been laid bare at a few points\r\nonly, and these are each crossed by one or two streams from higher\r\nlevels. The remainder are not exposed at all, and their arches are\r\ncrossed by numerous parallel streams. The Crescent arch is freshly\r\ntruncated by planation, and the Dana and Maze bear proof that they have\r\nat some time been truncated. The laccolites which stand highest with\r\nreference to the general surface are exempt from cross-drainage, and the\r\narches which lie low are completely overrun.\r\n\r\nIf we go back in imagination to a time when the erosion of the mountain\r\nwas so little advanced that the stream beds were three thousand feet\r\nhigher than they now are, we may suppose that very little trachyte was\r\nlaid bare. As the surface was degraded and a few laccolites were\r\nexposed, it would probably happen that some of the then existing streams\r\nwould be so placed as to run across the trachyte. But being unarmed as\r\nyet by the _débris_ of similar material they would corrade it very\r\nslowly; and the adjoining streams having only shale to encounter, would\r\nso far outstrip them as eventually to divert them by the process of\r\n“abstraction”. In this way the first-bared laccolites might be freed\r\nfrom cross-drainage and permitted to acquire such radiating systems of\r\nwaterways as we find them to possess. At a later stage when trachyte was\r\nexposed at many points and all streams were loaded with its waste, the\r\npower to corrade was increased, and the lower-lying laccolites could not\r\nturn aside the streams which overran them.\r\n\r\nThe work of planation is so frequently seen about the flanks of the\r\nHenry Mountains that there seems no violence in referring all the\r\ncross-drainage of lateral arches to its action; and if that is done the\r\nhistory of the erosion of the mountains takes the following form:\r\n\r\nWhen the laccolites were intruded, the mounds which they uplifted either\r\nrose from the bed of a lake or else turned back all streams which\r\ncrossed their sites; and in either case they established upon their\r\nflanks a new and “consequent” set of waterways. The highest mounds\r\nbecame centers of drainage, and sent their streams either across or\r\nbetween the lower. All the streams of the disturbed region rose within\r\nit and flowed outward. The degradation of the mounds probably began\r\nbefore the uplift was complete, but of this there is no evidence. As it\r\nproceeded the convex forms of the mounds were quickly obliterated and\r\nconcave profiles were substituted. The rocks which were first excavated\r\nwere not uniform in texture, but they were all sedimentary and were soft\r\nas compared to the trachyte. The Tertiary and probably the Upper\r\nCretaceous were removed from the summits before any of the igneous rocks\r\nwere brought to light, and during their removal the tendency of divides\r\nto permanence kept the drainage centers or maxima of surface at\r\nsubstantially the same points. When at length the trachyte was reached\r\nits hardness introduced a new factor. The eminences which contained it\r\nwere established more firmly as maxima, and their rate of degradation\r\nwas checked. With the checking of summit degradation and the addition of\r\ntrachyte to the transported material, planation began upon the flanks,\r\nand by its action the whole drainage has been reformed. One by one the\r\nlower laccolites are unearthed, and each one adds to the complexity and\r\nto the permanence of the drainage.\r\n\r\nIf the displacements were completed before the erosion began, the\r\nmountains were then of greater magnitude than at any later date. Before\r\nthe igneous nuclei were laid bare and while sedimentary rocks only were\r\nsubject to erosion, the rate of degradation was more rapid than it has\r\nbeen since the hardness and toughness of the trachyte have opposed it.\r\nIf the surrounding plain has been worn away at a uniform rate, the\r\nheight of the mountains (above the plain) must have first diminished to\r\na minimum and afterward increased. The minimum occurred at the beginning\r\nof the erosion of the trachyte, and at that time the mountains may even\r\nhave been reduced to the rank of hills. They owe their present\r\nmagnitude, not to the uplifting of the land in Middle Tertiary time, but\r\nto the contrast between the incoherence of the sandstones and shales of\r\nthe Mesozoic series and the extreme durability of the laccolites which\r\ntheir destruction has laid bare. And if the waste of the plain shall\r\ncontinue at a like uniform rate in the future, it is safe to prophesy\r\nthat the mountains will for a while continue to increase in relative\r\naltitude. The phase which will give the maximum resistance to\r\ndegradation has been reached in none of the mountains, except perhaps\r\nMount Hillers. In Mount Ellen the laccolites of the upper zone only have\r\nbeen denuded; the greater masses which underlie them will hold their\r\nplace more stubbornly. The main bodies of Mounts Ellsworth, Holmes, and\r\nPennell are unassailed, and the present prominence of their forms has\r\nbeen accomplished simply by the valor of their skirmish lines of dikes\r\nand spurs. In attaching to the least of the peaks the name of my friend\r\nMr. Holmes, I am confident that I commemorate his attainments by a\r\nmonument which will be more conspicuous to future generations and races\r\nthan it is to the present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI.\r\n                               ECONOMIC.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is little to add to what has already been said of the economic\r\nvalue of the mountains, and this chapter is hardly more than a\r\nregrouping of facts scattered through those that precede.\r\n\r\n_Coal._—Possibly some valuable though restricted deposit was overlooked;\r\nbut it is safe to say that no thick and continuous bed will be found.\r\nThe Cretaceous sandstones all contain thin and local beds—enough to mark\r\nthem as coal-bearing rocks—but there are no seams of value. The best\r\noutcrop was seen in the bank of the south branch of Lewis Creek where it\r\ncrosses the upturned edge of the Blue Gate sandstone. The seam has a\r\nthickness of four feet only, and is not well disposed for mining.\r\n\r\nBut if the Cretaceous coals were well developed it is to be doubted if\r\nthey would ever be used. They could have no local market. They could not\r\nbe carried to the east or south on account of the cañons. If taken\r\nnorthward they would have to compete with the coal of Castle Valley,\r\nwhich is more convenient and very abundant. If taken westward to the\r\nmetal mines of Nevada and Western Utah they would be undersold by the\r\nmore accessible coals found on the headwaters of the Virgin River and\r\nKanab Creek, and even by those of the Kaiparowits Plateau.\r\n\r\nThe _Gypsum_ and _Building Stones_ of the region need not be described.\r\nThey are plentiful in many parts of Utah, and however abundant in this\r\nremote place can never be in demand.\r\n\r\n_Gold, Silver, etc._—Three parties of “prospectors” have at different\r\ntimes made unsuccessful search for metalliferous veins. In the course of\r\nmy survey I spent more than a month’s time among the crystalline and\r\nmetamorphic formations of the mountain tops, and although directing my\r\nattention constantly to the rocks, did not discover a fissure vein.\r\nCombining these negative data with certain theoretic considerations\r\nwhich are set forth in the fourth chapter, I am led to the very\r\nconfident opinion that the essential conditions for the production of\r\nfissure veins have not existed in the Henry Mountains, and hence that\r\nthere are no valuable deposits of the precious metals. The same\r\ntheoretic considerations apply to other mountains of the same character,\r\nand I venture to predict that gold and silver will not be found in\r\npaying quantity in Navajo Mountain, the Sierra la Sal, the Sierra Abajo,\r\nthe Sierra Carisso, or the Sierra La Lata.\r\n\r\n_Agricultural Land._—Bowl Creek, both branches of Lewis Creek, and the\r\nsouth branch of Trachyte Creek can readily be led to tracts of land\r\nsufficiently level for farming, and each furnishes enough water to\r\nirrigate several hundred acres. It is possible that these tracts will\r\nprove useful for farming, but they lie a little too high to be assured\r\nof a favorable climate. The lowest has an altitude of 6,000, and the\r\nhighest of 6,800 feet.\r\n\r\n_Grazing Land._—Above the altitude of 7,500 feet there are many tracts\r\nof good grass, available for grazing through the greater part of the\r\nyear but covered by snow in the winter. Below that level there is a\r\ngreater area of inferior grass, available through the whole year. By\r\nusing one portion in summer and the other in winter the mountains could\r\nbe made to give permanent support to a herd of 3,000 or 4,000 cattle.\r\nWith such overstocking as is often practiced in Utah they may subsist\r\n10,000 animals for one or two years.\r\n\r\n_Timber._—The trees worthy to be classed as timber are of three\r\nspecies—fir (_Abies Engelmanni_), Douglass Spruce (_A. Douglasii_), and\r\nyellow pine (_Pinus ponderosa_). The pine is the most valuable and the\r\nfir the most abundant. The fir grows upon the mountain slopes, above the\r\nlevel of 7,500 feet and forms thick-set forests. The total area which it\r\ncovers is not far from twenty-five square miles. The spruce mingles with\r\nthe fir at the lower edges of the forests; and the pine forms a few open\r\ngroves a little lower down the slopes.\r\n\r\nIt is to be doubted if the trees will ever be cut. Other timber of the\r\nsame quality and superior in quantity lies between it and the\r\nsettlements, and neither railroad nor mine nor town is likely to create\r\na local demand.\r\n\r\n\r\nCoal, building stone, gypsum, and timber have no value for lack of a\r\nmarket, either present or prospective; gold and silver are not found;\r\nand there is little or no land that can be successfully farmed. Only for\r\ngrazing have the mountains a money value.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 INDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n Abajo Mountains, 67, 69, 152\r\n\r\n Agricultural lands, 152\r\n\r\n Alluvial cones and alluviation, 133, 139\r\n\r\n Alpine sculpture, 36, 38\r\n\r\n Altitudes of peaks and passes, 3, 117\r\n\r\n Analogues of the laccolite, 98\r\n\r\n Ancient rivers no larger than modern, 133\r\n\r\n Antecedent drainage, 143\r\n\r\n Arch, Bowl Creek, 45\r\n   , Crescent, 44\r\n   , Dana, 43\r\n   , G, 43\r\n   , Maze, 44\r\n   , Pulpit, 33, 147\r\n\r\n Arches, Forces which produced laccolitic, 87\r\n\r\n Aridity favorable to geological examination, 2, 98\r\n   of the Colorado Basin in former times, 120\r\n\r\n Aubrey Sandstone, 8\r\n\r\n\r\n Bad-lands, Sculpture of, 120, 140\r\n\r\n Bischof, on contraction of igneous rocks in cooling, 76\r\n\r\n Blue Gate flexure, 13\r\n   Sandstone, 4\r\n   Shale, 4\r\n\r\n Bonneville, Outlet of Lake, 134\r\n\r\n Bowl Creek arch, 45\r\n\r\n\r\n Cañons of the Colorado as obstructions to travel, 1, 151\r\n   as evidence of arid climate, 120\r\n\r\n Carboniferous strata, 8\r\n\r\n Carriso Mountains, 69, 152\r\n\r\n Circle Cliffs, 14\r\n\r\n Cleavage, Slaty, not found, 66\r\n   , Vertical, produced by sapping, 55\r\n\r\n Cliffs, Circle, 14\r\n\r\n Climate, Arid, favorable to geological examination, 2, 98\r\n   , General influence of, on erosion, 103\r\n   , Influence of, on sculpture, 117\r\n\r\n Coal, 5, 151\r\n\r\n Colorado Basin, History of the, 84\r\n   Desert, 134\r\n   River, Origin of the, 85\r\n\r\n Colors of sandstones, Local variation of, 7\r\n\r\n Comminution of detritus aids transportation, 106\r\n\r\n Competence, 110\r\n\r\n Conditions of rock flexure, 83\r\n\r\n Cones, Alluvial, 133\r\n\r\n Consequent drainage, 143\r\n\r\n Contact phenomena, 65\r\n\r\n Contraction of igneous rocks by cooling, 75, 80\r\n\r\n Corrasion, 100, 101\r\n   , Relation of, to declivity, 112\r\n     , to friction of flow, 109\r\n     , to transportation, 111\r\n\r\n Cover of the laccolites, Depth of the, 86, 94\r\n\r\n Crescent arch, 44\r\n\r\n Cotta, Prof. Bernhard von, cited, 75\r\n\r\n Cretaceous period, Disturbance at the close of the, 10, 85\r\n   rock series, 4\r\n\r\n Cross-lamination, Inclination of, 7\r\n\r\n\r\n Dana arch, 43\r\n\r\n Declivity, General influence of, upon erosion, 102\r\n   of stream beds, relation to corrasion, 112\r\n     , relation to transportation, 108\r\n   , Relation of, to quantity of water, 113\r\n\r\n Declivities, Influence of unequal, on divides, 140\r\n\r\n Degradation (see Erosion), 99, 115\r\n\r\n Delesse on contraction of igneous rocks in cooling, 76\r\n\r\n Densities of igneous rocks, 75\r\n   of sedimentary rocks, 77\r\n\r\n Density a condition of laccolitic intrusion, 73, 74\r\n   of porphyritic trachyte, 77\r\n\r\n Denudation (see Erosion), 99, 115\r\n   of laccolites, 21\r\n\r\n Deposition by running water, 111\r\n\r\n Diameters of laccolites, 92\r\n\r\n Dike near Mount Ellsworth, 59\r\n\r\n Dikes and sheets defined, 20\r\n   , Flat-topped, 28\r\n   of Mount Ellsworth, 23\r\n   of Mount Holmes, 28\r\n   , Relation of, to strains, 96\r\n\r\n Dinah Creek Pass, 3\r\n\r\n Dirty Devil River, Flood-plains of, 131\r\n\r\n Distances, Table of, 17\r\n\r\n Distribution of laccolites, Horizontal, 20, 30\r\n   , Vertical, 21, 56\r\n\r\n Divides in bad-lands, Rounding of, 122\r\n   , Instability of, 139\r\n   , Law of, 116\r\n   , Stability of, 138\r\n\r\n Drainage lines, Instability of, 125\r\n     , Stability of, 124\r\n   , Systems of, 124, 143\r\n\r\n Dutton, Capt.
