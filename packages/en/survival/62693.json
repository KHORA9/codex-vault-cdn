Considerable portions of\r\nthe volume have already appeared in substance as separate papers in\r\nthe Philosophical Magazine and other journals during the past ten or\r\ntwelve years. The theory, especially in as far as it relates to the\r\ncause of the glacial epoch, appears to be gradually gaining acceptance\r\nwith geologists. This, doubtless, is owing to the greatly increased\r\nand constantly increasing knowledge of the drift-phenomena, which has\r\ninduced the almost general conviction that a climate such as that of\r\nthe glacial epoch could only have resulted from cosmical causes.\r\n\r\nConsiderable attention has been devoted to objections, and to the\r\nremoval of slight misapprehensions, which have naturally arisen in\r\nregard to a subject comparatively new and, in many respects, complex,\r\nand beset with formidable difficulties.\r\n\r\nI have studiously avoided introducing anything of a hypothetical\r\ncharacter. All the conclusions are based either on known facts or\r\nadmitted physical principles. In short, the aim of the work, as will be\r\nshown in the introductory chapter, is to prove that secular changes of\r\nclimate follow, as a necessary effect, from admitted physical agencies,\r\nand that these changes, in as far as the past climatic condition of\r\nthe globe is concerned, fully meet the demand of the geologist.\r\n\r\nThe volume, though not intended as a popular treatise, will be found,\r\nI trust, to be perfectly plain and intelligible even to readers not\r\nfamiliar with physical science.\r\n\r\nI avail myself of this opportunity of expressing my obligations to my\r\ncolleagues, Mr. James Geikie, Mr. Robert L. Jack, Mr. Robert Etheridge,\r\njun., and also to Mr. James Paton, of the Edinburgh Museum of Science\r\nand Art, for their valuable assistance rendered while these pages were\r\npassing through the press. To the kindness of Mr. James Bennie I am\r\nindebted for the copious index at the end of the volume, as well as\r\nfor many of the facts relating to the glacial deposits of the West of\r\nScotland.\r\n\r\n                                                         JAMES CROLL.\r\n\r\nEDINBURGH, _March, 1875_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n                             INTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n                                                                    PAGE\r\n  The Fundamental Problem of Geology.—Geology a Dynamical\r\n      Science.—The Nature of a Geological Principle.—Theories\r\n      of Geological Climate.—Geological Climate dependent\r\n      on Astronomical Causes.—An Important Consideration\r\n      overlooked.—Abstract of the Line of Argument pursued in the\r\n      Volume                                                           1\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n      OCEAN-CURRENTS IN RELATION TO THE DISTRIBUTION OF HEAT OVER\r\n                              THE GLOBE.\r\n\r\n  The absolute Heating-power of Ocean-currents.—Volume of\r\n      the Gulf-stream.—Absolute Amount of Heat conveyed by\r\n      it.—Greater Portion of Moisture in Inter-tropical Regions\r\n      falls as Rain in those Regions.—Land along the Equator\r\n      tends to lower the Temperature of the Globe.—Influence\r\n      of Gulf-stream on Climate of Europe.—Temperature of\r\n      Space.—Radiation of a Particle.—Professor Dove on Normal\r\n      Temperature.—Temperature of Equator and Poles in the Absence\r\n      of Ocean-currents.—Temperature of London, how much due to\r\n      Ocean-currents                                                  23\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n    OCEAN-CURRENTS IN RELATION TO THE DISTRIBUTION OF HEAT OVER THE\r\n                         GLOBE.—(_Continued._)\r\n\r\n  Influence of the Gulf-stream on the Climate of the Arctic\r\n      Regions.—Absolute Amount of Heat received by the Arctic\r\n      Regions from the Sun.—Influence of Ocean-currents shown by\r\n      another Method.—Temperature of a Globe all Water or all\r\n      Land according to Professor J.

It will be\r\nat once admitted that an acquaintance with the agencies by means of\r\nwhich those successive changes and modifications were effected, is of\r\nparamount importance to the geologist. What, then, are those agencies?\r\nAlthough volcanic and other subterranean eruptions, earthquakes,\r\nupheavals, and subsidences of the land have taken place in all ages,\r\nyet no truth is now better established than that it is not by these\r\nconvulsions and cataclysms of nature that those great changes were\r\neffected. It was rather by the ordinary agencies that we see every day\r\nat work around us, such as rain, rivers, heat and cold, frost and snow.\r\nThe valleys were not produced by violent dislocations, nor the hills\r\nby sudden upheavals, but were actually carved out of the solid rock,\r\nsilently and gently, by the agencies to which we have referred. “The\r\ntools,” to quote the words of Professor Geikie, “by which this great\r\nwork has been done are of the simplest and most every-day order—the\r\nair, rain, frosts, springs, brooks, rivers, glaciers, icebergs, and the\r\nsea. These tools have been at work from the earliest times of which\r\nany geological record has been preserved. Indeed, it is out of the\r\naccumulated chips and dust which they have made, afterwards hardened\r\ninto solid rock and upheaved, that the very framework of our continents\r\nhas been formed.”[1]\r\n\r\nIt will be observed—and this is the point requiring particular\r\nattention—that the agencies referred to are the ordinary meteorological\r\nor climatic agencies. In fact, it is these agencies which constitute\r\nclimate. The various peculiarities or modifications of climate result\r\nfrom a preponderance of one or more of these agencies over the rest.\r\nWhen heat, for example, predominates, we have a hot or tropical\r\nclimate. When cold and frost predominate, we have a rigorous or arctic\r\nclimate. With moisture in excess, we have a damp and rainy climate;\r\nand so on. But this is not all. These climatic agencies are not only\r\nthe factors which carved out the rocky face of the globe into hill\r\nand dale, and spread over the whole a mantle of soil; but by them are\r\ndetermined the character of the _flora_ and _fauna_ which exist on\r\nthat soil. The flora and fauna of a district are determined mainly by\r\nthe character of the climate, and not by the nature of the soil, or\r\nthe conformation of the ground. It is from difference of climate that\r\ntropical life differs so much from arctic, and both these from the life\r\nof temperate regions. It is climate, and climate alone, that causes\r\nthe orange and the vine to blossom, and the olive to flourish, in the\r\nsouth, but denies them to the north, of Europe. It is climate, and\r\nclimate alone, that enables the forest tree to grow on the plain, but\r\nnot on the mountain top; that causes wheat and barley to flourish on\r\nthe mainland of Scotland, but not on the steppes of Siberia.\r\n\r\nAgain, if we compare flat countries with mountainous, highlands with\r\nlowlands, or islands with continents, we shall find that difference of\r\nclimatic conditions is the chief reason why life in the one differs\r\nso much from life in the other. And if we turn to the sea we find\r\nthat organic life is there as much under the domain of climate as on\r\nthe land, only the conditions are much less complex. For in the case\r\nof the sea, difference in the temperature of the water may be said\r\nto constitute almost the only difference of climatic conditions.\r\nIf there is one fact more clearly brought out than another by the\r\nrecent deep-sea explorations, it is this, that nothing exercises so\r\nmuch influence on organic life in the ocean as the temperature of the\r\nwater. In fact, so much is this the case, that warm zones were found\r\nto be almost equivalent to zones of life. It was found that even the\r\nenormous pressure at the bottom of the ocean does not exercise so much\r\ninfluence on life as the temperature of the water. There are few, I\r\npresume, who reflect on the subject that will not readily admit that,\r\nwhether as regards the great physical changes which are taking place on\r\nthe surface of our globe, or as regards the growth and distribution of\r\nplant and animal life, the ordinary climatic agents are the real agents\r\nat work, and that, compared with them, all other agencies sink into\r\ninsignificance.\r\n\r\nIt will also be admitted that what holds true of the present holds\r\nequally true of the past. Climatic agents are not only now the most\r\nimportant and influential; they have been so during all past geological\r\nages. They were so during the Cainozoic as much as during the present;\r\nand there is no reason for supposing they were otherwise during the\r\nremoter Mesozoic and Palæozoic epochs. They have been the principal\r\nfactors concerned in that long succession of events and changes which\r\nhave taken place since the time of the solidification of the earth’s\r\ncrust. The stratified rocks of the globe contain all the records which\r\nnow remain of their action, and it is the special duty of the geologist\r\nto investigate and read those records. It will be at once admitted that\r\nin order to a proper understanding of the events embodied in these\r\nrecords, an acquaintance with the agencies by which they were produced\r\nis of the utmost importance. In fact, it is only by this means that we\r\ncan hope to arrive at their rational explanation. A knowledge of the\r\nagents, and of the laws of their operations, is, in all the physical\r\nsciences, the means by which we arrive at a rational comprehension\r\nof the effects produced. If we have before us some complex and\r\nintricate effects which have been produced by heat, or by light, or by\r\nelectricity, &c., in order to understand them we must make ourselves\r\nacquainted with the agents by which they were produced and the laws of\r\ntheir action. If the effects to be considered be, for example, those of\r\nheat, then we must make ourselves acquainted with this agent and its\r\nlaws. If they be of electricity, then a knowledge of electricity and\r\nits laws becomes requisite.\r\n\r\nThis is no mere arbitrary mode of procedure which may be adopted in\r\none science and rejected in another. It is in reality a necessity of\r\nthought arising out of the very constitution of our intellect; for the\r\nobjective law of the agent is the conception by means of which the\r\neffects are subjectively united in a rational unity. We may describe,\r\narrange, and classify the effects as we may, but without a knowledge of\r\nthe laws of the agent we can have no rational unity. We have not got\r\nthe higher conception by which they can be _comprehended_. It is this\r\nrelationship between the effects and the laws of the agent, a knowledge\r\nof which really constitutes a science. We might examine, arrange, and\r\ndescribe for a thousand years the effects produced by heat, and still\r\nwe should have no science of heat unless we had a knowledge of the\r\nlaws of that agent. The effects would never be seen to be necessarily\r\nconnected with anything known to us; we could not connect them with\r\nany rational principle from which they could be deduced _à priori_.\r\nThe same remarks hold, of course, equally true of all sciences, in\r\nwhich the things to be considered stand in the relationship of cause\r\nand effect. Geology is no exception. It is not like systematic botany,\r\na mere science of classification. It has to explain and account for\r\neffects produced; and these effects can no more be explained without\r\na knowledge of the laws of the agents which produced them, than can\r\nthe effects of heat without a knowledge of the laws of heat. The only\r\ndistinction between geology and heat, light, electricity, &c., is,\r\nthat in geology the effects to be explained have almost all occurred\r\nalready, whereas in these other sciences effects actually taking place\r\nhave to be explained. But this distinction is of no importance to\r\nour present purpose, for effects which have already occurred can no\r\nmore be explained without a knowledge of the laws of the agent which\r\nproduced them than can effects which are in the act of occurring. It\r\nis, moreover, not strictly true that all the effects to be explained\r\nby the geologist are already past. It falls within the scope of his\r\nscience to account for the changes which are at present taking place on\r\nthe earth’s crust.\r\n\r\nNo amount of description, arrangement, and classification, however\r\nperfect or accurate, of the facts which come under the eye of the\r\ngeologist can ever constitute a science of geology any more than a\r\ndescription and classification of the effects of heat could constitute\r\na science of heat. This will, no doubt, be admitted by every one who\r\nreflects upon the subject, and it will be maintained that geology,\r\nlike every other science, must possess principles applicable to the\r\nfacts. But here confusion and misconception will arise unless there be\r\ndistinct and definite ideas as to what ought to constitute a geological\r\nprinciple. It is not every statement or rule that may apply to a great\r\nmany facts, which will constitute a geological principle. A geological\r\nprinciple must bear the same characteristics as the principles of those\r\nsciences to which we have referred. What, then, is the nature of the\r\nprinciples of light, heat, electricity, &c.? The principles of heat\r\nare the laws of heat. The principles of electricity are the laws of\r\nelectricity. And these laws are nothing more nor less than the ways\r\naccording to which these agents produce their effects. The principles\r\nof geology are therefore the laws of geology. But the laws of geology\r\nmust be simply the laws of the geological agents, or, in other words,\r\nthe methods by which they produce their effects. Any other so-called\r\nprinciple can be nothing more than an empirical rule, adopted for\r\nconvenience. Possessing no rationality in itself, it cannot be justly\r\nregarded as a principle. In order to rationality the principle must be\r\neither resolvable into, or logically deducible from, the laws of the\r\nagents. Unless it possess this quality we cannot give the explanation\r\n_à priori_.\r\n\r\nThe reason of all this is perfectly obvious. The things to be explained\r\nare effects; and the relationship between cause and effect affords the\r\nsubjective connection between the principle and the explanation. The\r\nexplanation follows from the principle simply as the effect results\r\nfrom the laws of the agent or cause.\r\n\r\n_Theories of Geological Climate._—We have already seen that the\r\ngeological agents are chiefly the ordinary climatic agents.\r\nConsequently, the main principles of geology must be the laws of the\r\nclimatic agents, or some logical deductions from them. It therefore\r\nfollows that, in order to a purely scientific geology, the grand\r\nproblem must be one of geological climate. It is through geological\r\nclimate that we can hope to arrive ultimately at principles which will\r\nafford a rational explanation of the multifarious facts which have\r\nbeen accumulating during the past century. The facts of geology are\r\nas essential to the establishment of the principles, as the facts of\r\nheat, light, and electricity are essential to the establishment of the\r\nprinciples of these sciences. A theory of geological climate devised\r\nwithout reference to the facts would be about as worthless as a theory\r\nof heat or of electricity devised without reference to the facts of\r\nthese sciences.\r\n\r\nIt has all along been an admitted opinion among geologists that the\r\nclimatic condition of our globe has not, during past ages, been\r\nuniformly the same as at present. For a long time it was supposed that\r\nduring the Cambrian, Silurian, and other early geological periods, the\r\nclimate of our globe was much hotter than now, and that ever since\r\nit has been gradually becoming cooler. And this high temperature of\r\nPalæozoic ages was generally referred to the influence of the earth’s\r\ninternal heat. It has, however, been proved by Sir William Thomson[2]\r\nthat the general climate of our globe could not have been sensibly\r\naffected by internal heat at any time more than ten thousand years\r\nafter the commencement of the solidification of the surface. This\r\nphysicist has proved that the present influence of internal heat on\r\nthe temperature amounts to about only 1/75th of a degree. Not only\r\nis the theory of internal heat now generally abandoned, but it is\r\nadmitted that we have no good geological evidence that climate was much\r\nhotter during Palæozoic ages than now; and much less, that it has been\r\nbecoming _uniformly_ colder.\r\n\r\nThe great discovery of the glacial epoch, and more lately that of a\r\nmild and temperate condition of climate extending during the Miocene\r\nand other periods to North Greenland, have introduced a complete\r\nrevolution of ideas in reference to geological climate. Those\r\ndiscoveries showed that our globe has not only undergone changes of\r\nclimate, but changes of the most extraordinary character. They showed\r\nthat at one time not only an arctic condition of climate prevailed in\r\nour island, but that the greater part of the temperate region down\r\nto comparatively low latitudes was buried under ice, while at other\r\nperiods Greenland and the Arctic regions, probably up to the North\r\nPole, were not only free from ice, but were covered with a rich and\r\nluxuriant vegetation.\r\n\r\nTo account for these extraordinary changes of climate has generally\r\nbeen regarded as the most difficult and perplexing problem which has\r\nfallen to the lot of the geologist. Some have attempted to explain\r\nthem by assuming a displacement of the earth’s axis of rotation in\r\nconsequence of the uprising of large mountain masses on some part\r\nof the earth’s surface. But it has been shown by Professor Airy,[3]\r\nSir William Thomson,[4] and others, that the earth’s equatorial\r\nprotuberance is such that no geological change on its surface could\r\never possibly alter the position of the axis of rotation to an extent\r\nwhich could at all sensibly affect climate. Others, again, have tried\r\nto explain the change of climate by supposing, with Poisson, that the\r\nearth during its past geological history may have passed through hotter\r\nand colder parts of space. This is not a very satisfactory hypothesis.\r\nThere is no doubt a difference in the quantity of force in the form of\r\nheat passing through different parts of space; but space itself is not\r\na substance which can possibly be either cold or hot. If, therefore,\r\nwe were to adopt this hypothesis, we must assume that the earth during\r\nthe hot periods must have been in the vicinity of some other great\r\nsource of heat and light besides the sun. But the proximity of a\r\nmass of such magnitude as would be sufficient to affect to any great\r\nextent the earth’s climate would, by its gravity, seriously disarrange\r\nthe mechanism of our solar system. Consequently, if our solar system\r\nhad ever, during any former period of its history, really come into\r\nthe vicinity of such a mass, the orbits of the planets ought at the\r\npresent day to afford some evidence of it. But again, in order to\r\naccount for a cold period, such as the glacial epoch, we have to assume\r\nthat the earth must have come into the vicinity of a cold body.[5]\r\nBut recent discoveries in regard to inter-glacial periods are wholly\r\nirreconcilable with this theory.\r\n\r\nA change in the obliquity of the ecliptic has frequently been, and\r\nstill is, appealed to as an explanation of geological climate. This\r\ntheory appears, however, to be beset by a twofold objection: (1), it\r\ncan be shown from celestial mechanics, that the variations in the\r\nobliquity of the ecliptic must always have been so small that they\r\ncould not materially affect the climatic condition of the globe; and\r\n(2), even admitting that the obliquity could change to an indefinite\r\nextent, it can be shown[6] that no increase or decrease, however great,\r\ncould possibly account for either the glacial epoch or a warm temperate\r\ncondition of climate in polar regions.\r\n\r\nThe theory that the sun is a variable star, and that the glacial\r\nepochs of the geologists may correspond to periods of decrease in the\r\nsun’s heat, has lately been advanced. This theory is also open to two\r\nobjections: (1), a general diminution of heat[7] never could produce\r\na glacial epoch; and (2), even if it could, it would not explain\r\ninter-glacial periods.\r\n\r\nThe only other theory on the subject worthy of notice is that\r\n\r\nof Sir Charles Lyell. Those extraordinary changes of climate are,\r\naccording to his theory, attributed to differences in the distribution\r\nof land and water. Sir Charles concludes that, were the land all\r\ncollected round the poles, while the equatorial zones were occupied by\r\nthe ocean, the general temperature would be lowered to an extent that\r\nwould account for the glacial epoch. And, on the other hand, were the\r\nland all collected along the equator, while the polar regions were\r\ncovered with sea, this would raise the temperature of the globe to an\r\nenormous extent. It will be shown in subsequent chapters that this\r\ntheory does not duly take into account the prodigious influence exerted\r\non climate by means of the heat conveyed from equatorial to temperate\r\nand polar regions by means of ocean-currents. In Chapters II. and III.\r\nI have endeavoured to prove (1), that were it not for the heat conveyed\r\nfrom equatorial to temperate and polar regions by this means, the\r\nthermal condition of the globe would be totally different from what it\r\nis at present; and (2), that the effect of placing all the land along\r\nthe equator would be diametrically the opposite of that which Sir\r\nCharles supposes.\r\n\r\nBut supposing that difference in the distribution of land and water\r\nwould produce the effects attributed to it, nevertheless it would not\r\naccount for those extraordinary changes of climate which have occurred\r\nduring geological epochs. Take, for example, the glacial epoch.\r\nGeologists almost all agree that little or no change has taken place\r\nin the relative distribution of sea and land since that _epoch_. All\r\nour main continents and islands not only existed then as they do now,\r\nbut every year is adding to the amount of evidence which goes to show\r\nthat so recent, geologically considered, is the glacial epoch that the\r\nvery contour of the surface was pretty much the same then as it is at\r\nthe present day. But this is not all; for even should we assume (1),\r\nthat a difference in the distribution of sea and land would produce the\r\neffects referred to, and (2), that we had good geological evidence to\r\nshow that at a very recent period a form of distribution existed which\r\nwould produce the necessary glacial conditions, still the glacial\r\nepoch would not be explained, for the phenomena of warm inter-glacial\r\nperiods would completely upset the theory.\r\n\r\n_Geological Climate depending on Astronomical Causes._—For a good many\r\nyears past, an impression has been gradually gaining ground amongst\r\ngeologists that the glacial epoch, as well as the extraordinary\r\ncondition of climate which prevailed in arctic regions during the\r\nMiocene and other periods, must some way or other have resulted from\r\na cosmical cause; but all seemed at a loss to conjecture what that\r\ncause could possibly be. It was apparent that the cosmical cause must\r\nbe sought for in the relations of our earth to the sun; but a change\r\nin the obliquity of the ecliptic and the eccentricity of the earth’s\r\norbit are the only changes from which any sensible effect on climate\r\ncould possibly be expected to result. It was shown, however, by Laplace\r\nthat the change of obliquity was confined within so narrow limits that\r\nit has scarcely ever been appealed to as a cause seriously affecting\r\nclimate. The only remaining cause to which appeal could be made was\r\nthe change in the eccentricity of the earth’s orbit—precession of the\r\nequinoxes without eccentricity producing, of course, no effect whatever\r\non climate. Upwards of forty years ago Sir John Herschel and a few\r\nother astronomers directed their attention to the consideration of this\r\ncause, but the result arrived at was adverse to the supposition that\r\nchange of eccentricity could greatly affect the climate of our globe.\r\n\r\nAs some misapprehension seems to prevail with reference to this, I\r\nwould take the liberty of briefly adverting to the history of the\r\nmatter,—referring the reader to the Appendix for fuller details.\r\n\r\nAbout the beginning of the century some writers attributed the lower\r\ntemperature of the southern hemisphere to the fact that the sun remains\r\nabout seven days less on that hemisphere than on the northern; their\r\nview being that the southern hemisphere on this account receives\r\nseven days less heat than the northern. Sir Charles Lyell, in the\r\nfirst edition of his “Principles,” published in 1830, refers to this\r\nas a cause which might produce some slight effect on climate. Sir\r\nCharles’s remarks seem to have directed Sir John Herschel’s attention\r\nto the subject, for in the latter part of the same year he read a\r\npaper before the Geological Society on the astronomical causes which\r\nmay influence geological phenomena, in which, after pointing out the\r\nmistake into which Sir Charles had been led in concluding that the\r\nsouthern hemisphere receives less heat than the northern, he considers\r\nthe question as to whether geological climate could be influenced by\r\nchanges in the eccentricity of the earth’s orbit. He did not appear at\r\nthe time to have been aware of the conclusions arrived at by Lagrange\r\nregarding the superior limit of the eccentricity of the earth’s orbit;\r\nbut he came to the conclusion that possibly the climate of our globe\r\nmay have been affected by variations in the eccentricity of its orbit.\r\n“An amount of variation,” he says, “which we need not hesitate to\r\nadmit (at least provisionally) as a possible one, may be productive\r\nof considerable diversity of climate, and may operate during great\r\nperiods of time either to mitigate or to exaggerate the difference of\r\nwinter and summer temperatures, so as to produce alternately in the\r\nsame latitude of either hemisphere a perpetual spring, or the extreme\r\nvicissitudes of a burning summer and a rigorous winter.”\r\n\r\nThis opinion, however, was unfortunately to a great extent nullified\r\nby the statement which shortly afterwards appeared in his “Treatise\r\non Astronomy,” and also in the “Outlines of Astronomy,” to the effect\r\nthat the elliptic form of the earth’s orbit has but a very trifling\r\ninfluence in producing variation of temperature corresponding to the\r\nsun’s distance; the reason being that whatever may be the ellipticity\r\nof the orbit, it follows that equal amounts of heat are received\r\nfrom the sun in passing over equal angles round it, in whatever part\r\nof the ellipse those angles may be situated. Those angles will of\r\ncourse be described in unequal times, but the greater proximity of\r\nthe sun exactly compensates for the more rapid description, and thus\r\nan equilibrium of heat is maintained. The sun, for example, is much\r\nnearer the earth when he is over the southern hemisphere than he is\r\nwhen over the northern; but the southern hemisphere does not on this\r\naccount receive more heat than the northern; for, owing to the greater\r\nvelocity of the earth when nearest the sun, the sun does not remain\r\nso long on the southern hemisphere as he does on the northern. These\r\ntwo effects so exactly counterbalance each other that, whatever be\r\nthe extent of the eccentricity, the total amount of heat reaching\r\nboth hemispheres is the same. And he considered that this beautiful\r\ncompensating principle would protect the climate of our globe from\r\nbeing seriously affected by an increase in the eccentricity of its\r\norbit, unless the extent of that increase was very great.\r\n\r\n“Were it not,” he says, “for this, the eccentricity of the orbit\r\nwould materially influence the transition of seasons. The fluctuation\r\nof distance amounts to nearly 1/30th of its mean quantity, and\r\nconsequently the fluctuation in the sun’s direct heating power to\r\ndouble this, or 1/15th of the whole. Now the perihelion of the orbit is\r\nsituated nearly at the place of the northern winter solstice; so that,\r\nwere it not for the compensation we have just described, the effect\r\nwould be to exaggerate the difference of summer and winter in the\r\nsouthern hemisphere, and to moderate it in the northern; thus producing\r\na more violent alternation of climate in the one hemisphere, and an\r\napproach to perpetual spring in the other. As it is, however, no such\r\ninequality subsists, but an equal and impartial distribution of heat\r\nand light is accorded to both.”[8]\r\n\r\nHerschel’s opinion was shortly afterwards adopted and advocated by\r\nArago[9] and by Humboldt.[10]\r\n\r\nArago, for example, states that so little is the climate of our globe\r\naffected by the eccentricity of its orbit, that even were the orbit to\r\nbecome as eccentric as that of the planet Pallas (that is, as great as\r\n0·24), “still this would not alter in any appreciable manner the mean\r\nthermometrical state of the globe.”\r\n\r\nThis idea, supported by these great authorities, got possession of the\r\npublic mind; and ever since it has been almost universally regarded\r\nas settled that the great changes of climate indicated by geological\r\nphenomena could not have resulted from any change in the relation of\r\nthe earth to the sun.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, one effect that was not regarded as compensated. The\r\ntotal amount of heat received by the earth is inversely proportional\r\nto the minor axis of its orbit; and it follows, therefore, that the\r\ngreater the eccentricity, the greater is the total amount of heat\r\nreceived by the earth. On this account it was concluded that an\r\nincrease of eccentricity would tend to a certain extent to produce a\r\nwarmer climate.\r\n\r\nAll those conclusions to which I refer, arrived at by astronomers, are\r\nperfectly legitimate so far as the direct effects of eccentricity are\r\nconcerned; and it was quite natural, and, in fact, proper to conclude\r\nthat there was nothing in the mere increase of eccentricity that could\r\nproduce a glacial epoch. How unnatural would it have been to have\r\nconcluded that an increase in the quantity of heat received from the\r\nsun should lower the temperature, and cover the country with snow and\r\nice! Neither would excessively cold winters, followed by excessively\r\nhot summers, produce a glacial epoch. To assert, therefore, that the\r\npurely astronomical causes could produce such an effect would be simply\r\nabsurd.\r\n\r\n_Important Consideration overlooked._—The important fact, however, was\r\noverlooked that, although the glacial epoch could not result _directly_\r\nfrom an increase of eccentricity, it might nevertheless do so\r\n_indirectly_. Although an increase of eccentricity could have no direct\r\ntendency to lower the temperature and cover our country with ice, yet\r\nit might bring into operation physical agents which would produce this\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nIf, instead of endeavouring to trace a direct connection between a high\r\ncondition of eccentricity and a glacial condition of climate, we turn\r\nour attention to the consideration of what are the physical effects\r\nwhich result from an increase of eccentricity, we shall find that a\r\nhost of physical agencies are brought into operation, the combined\r\neffect of which is to lower to a very great extent the temperature of\r\nthe hemisphere whose winters occur in aphelion, and to raise to nearly\r\nas great an extent the temperature of the opposite hemisphere, whose\r\nwinters of course occur in perihelion. Until attention was directed to\r\nthose physical circumstances to which I refer, it was impossible that\r\nthe true cause of the glacial epoch could have been discovered; and,\r\nmoreover, many of the indirect and physical effects, which in reality\r\nwere those that brought about the glacial epoch, could not, in the\r\nnature of things, have been known previously to recent discoveries in\r\nthe science of heat.\r\n\r\nThe consideration and discussion of those various physical agencies are\r\nthe chief aim of the following pages.\r\n\r\n_Abstract of the Line of Argument pursued in this Volume._—I shall\r\nnow proceed to give a brief abstract of the line of argument pursued\r\nin this volume. But as a considerable portion of it is devoted to the\r\nconsideration of objections and difficulties bearing either directly\r\nor indirectly on the theory, it will be necessary to point out what\r\nthose difficulties are, how they arose, and the methods which have been\r\nadopted to overcome them.\r\n\r\nChapter IV. contains an outline of the physical agencies affecting\r\nclimate which are brought into operation by an increase of\r\neccentricity. By far the most important of all those agencies, and the\r\none which mainly brought about the glacial epoch, is the _Deflection_\r\nof Ocean-Currents. The consideration of the indirect physical\r\nconnection between a high state of eccentricity and the deflection\r\nof ocean-currents, and also the enormous influence on climate which\r\nresults from this deflection constitute not only the most important\r\npart of the subject, but the one beset with the greatest amount of\r\ndifficulties.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties besetting this part of the theory arise mainly from\r\nthe imperfect state of our knowledge, (1st) with reference to the\r\nabsolute amount of heat transferred from equatorial to temperate and\r\npolar regions by means of ocean-currents and the influence which the\r\nheat thus transferred has on the distribution of temperature on the\r\nearth’s surface; and (2nd) in connection with the physical cause of\r\nocean circulation.\r\n\r\nIn Chapters II. and III. I have entered at considerable length into\r\nthe consideration of the effects of ocean currents on the distribution\r\nof heat over the globe. The only current of which anything like\r\nan accurate estimate of volume and temperature has been made is\r\nthe Gulf-stream. In reference to this stream we have a means of\r\ndetermining in absolute measure the quantity of heat conveyed by it.\r\nOn the necessary computation being made, it is found that the amount\r\ntransferred by the Gulf-stream from equatorial regions into the North\r\nAtlantic is enormously greater than was ever anticipated, amounting\r\nto no less than one-fifth part of the entire heat possessed by the\r\nNorth Atlantic. This striking fact casts a new light on the question\r\nof the distribution of heat over the globe. It will be seen that to\r\nsuch an extent is the temperature of the equatorial regions lowered,\r\nand that of high temperate, and polar regions raised, by means of ocean\r\ncurrents, that were they to cease, and each latitude to depend solely\r\non the heat received directly from the sun, only a very small portion\r\nof the globe would be habitable by the present order of beings. This\r\nbeing the case, it becomes obvious to what an extent the deflection\r\nof ocean currents must affect temperature. For example, were the\r\nGulf-stream stopped, and the heat conveyed by it deflected into the\r\nSouthern Ocean, how enormously would this tend to lower the temperature\r\nof the northern hemisphere, and raise the temperature south of the\r\nequator.\r\n\r\nChapters VI., VII., VIII., IX., X., and XIII., are devoted to the\r\nconsideration of the physical cause of oceanic circulation. This has\r\nbeen found to be the most difficult and perplexing part of the whole\r\ninquiry. The difficulties mainly arise from the great diversity of\r\nopinion and confusion of ideas prevailing in regard to the mechanics\r\nof the subject. There are two theories propounded to account for\r\noceanic circulation; the one which may be called the _Wind_ theory, and\r\nthe other the _Gravitation_ theory; and this diversity of opinion and\r\nconfusion of ideas prevail in connection with both theories. As the\r\nquestion of the cause of oceanic circulation has not only a direct and\r\nimportant bearing on the subject of the present volume, but is further\r\none of much general interest, I have entered somewhat fully into the\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nThe Gravitation theories may be divided into two classes. The first of\r\nthese attributes the Gulf-stream and other sensible currents of the\r\nocean to difference of specific gravity, resulting from difference\r\nof temperature between the sea in equatorial and polar regions. The\r\nleading advocate of this theory was the late Lieutenant Maury, who\r\nbrought it so much into prominence in his interesting book on the\r\n“Physical Geography of the Sea.” The other class does not admit that\r\nthe sensible currents of the ocean can be produced by difference of\r\nspecific gravity; but they maintain that difference of temperature\r\nbetween the sea in equatorial and polar regions produces a general\r\nmovement of the upper portion of the sea from the equator to the\r\npoles, and a counter-movement of the under portion from the poles\r\nto the equator. This form of the gravitation theory has been ably\r\nand zealously advocated by Dr. Carpenter, who may be regarded as\r\nits representative. The Wind theories also divide into two classes.\r\nAccording to the one ocean currents are caused and maintained by the\r\nimpulse of the trade-winds, while according to the other they are\r\ndue not to the impulse of the trade-winds alone, but to that of the\r\nprevailing winds of the globe, regarded as a general system. The former\r\nof these is the one generally accepted; the latter is that advocated in\r\nthe present volume.\r\n\r\nThe relations which these theories bear to the question of secular\r\nchange of climate, will be found stated at length in Chapter VI. It\r\nwill, however, be better to state here in a few words what those\r\nrelations are. When the eccentricity of the earth’s orbit attains a\r\nhigh value, the hemisphere, whose winter solstice occurs in aphelion,\r\nhas, for reasons which are explained in Chapter IV., its temperature\r\nlowered, while that of the opposite hemisphere is raised. Let us\r\nsuppose the northern hemisphere to be the cold one, and the southern\r\nthe warm one. The difference of temperature between the equator and\r\nthe North Pole will then be greater than between the equator and the\r\nSouth Pole; according, therefore, to theory, the trades of the northern\r\nhemisphere will be stronger than those of the southern, and will\r\nconsequently blow across the equator to some distance on the southern\r\nhemisphere. This state of things will tend to deflect equatorial\r\ncurrents southwards, impelling the warm water of the equatorial regions\r\nmore into the southern or warm hemisphere than into the northern or\r\ncold hemisphere. The tendency of all this will be to exaggerate the\r\ndifference of temperature already existing between the two hemispheres.\r\nIf, on the other hand, the great ocean currents which convey the warm\r\nequatorial waters to temperate and polar regions be not produced by\r\nthe impulse of the winds, but by difference of temperature, as Maury\r\nmaintains, then in the case above supposed the equatorial waters would\r\nbe deflected more into the northern or cold hemisphere than into the\r\nsouthern or warm hemisphere, because the difference of temperature\r\nbetween the equator and the poles would be greater on the cold than\r\non the warm hemisphere. This, of course, would tend to neutralize or\r\ncounteract that difference of temperature between the two hemispheres\r\nwhich had been previously produced by eccentricity. In short, this\r\ntheory of circulation would effectually prevent eccentricity from\r\nseriously affecting climate.\r\n\r\nChapters VI. and VII. have been devoted to an examination of this form\r\nof the gravitation theory.\r\n\r\nThe above remarks apply equally to Dr. Carpenter’s form of the theory;\r\nfor according to a doctrine of General Oceanic Circulation resulting\r\nfrom difference of specific gravity between the water at the equator\r\nand at the poles, the equatorial water will be carried more to the\r\ncold than to the warm hemisphere. It is perfectly true that a belief\r\nin a general oceanic circulation may be held quite consistently with\r\nthe theory of secular changes of climate, provided it be admitted\r\nthat not this general circulation but ocean currents are the great\r\nagency employed in distributing heat over the globe. The advocates of\r\nthe theory, however, admit no such thing, but regard ocean currents\r\nas of secondary importance. It may be stated that the existence of\r\nthis general ocean circulation has never been detected by actual\r\nobservation. It is simply assumed in order to account for certain\r\nfacts, and it is asserted that such a circulation must take place as\r\na physical necessity. I freely admit that were it not that the warm\r\nwater of equatorial regions is being constantly carried off by means\r\nof ocean currents such as the Gulf-stream, it would accumulate till,\r\nin order to restoration of equilibrium, such a general movement as is\r\nsupposed would be generated. But it will be shown that the warm water\r\nin equatorial regions is being drained off so rapidly by ocean currents\r\nthat the actual density of an equatorial column differs so little\r\nfrom that of a polar column that the force of gravity resulting from\r\nthat difference is so infinitesimal that it is doubtful whether it is\r\nsufficient to produce sensible motion. I have also shown in Chapter\r\nVIII. that all the facts which this theory is designed to explain are\r\nnot only explained by the wind theory, but are deducible from it as\r\nnecessary consequences. In Chapter XI. it is proved, by contrasting\r\nthe quantity of heat conveyed by ocean currents from inter-tropical to\r\ntemperate and polar regions with such an amount as could possibly be\r\nconveyed by means of a general oceanic circulation, that the latter\r\nsinks into insignificance before the former. In Chapters X. and XII.\r\nthe various objections which have been advanced by Dr. Carpenter and\r\nMr. Findlay are discussed at considerable length, and in Chapter IX.\r\nI have entered somewhat minutely into an examination of the mechanics\r\nof the gravitation theory. A statement of the wind theory is given in\r\nChapter XIII.; and in Chapter XIV. is shown the relation of this theory\r\nto the theory of Secular changes of climate. This terminates the part\r\nof the inquiry relating to oceanic circulation.\r\n\r\nWe now come to the _crucial test_ of the theories respecting the cause\r\nof the glacial epoch, viz., Warm Inter-glacial Periods. In Chapters\r\nXV. and XVI. I have given a statement of the geological facts which\r\ngo to prove that that long epoch known as the Glacial was not one\r\nof continuous cold, but consisted of a succession of cold and warm\r\nperiods. This condition of things is utterly inexplicable on every\r\ntheory of the cause of the glacial epoch which has hitherto been\r\nadvanced; but, according to the physical theory of secular changes of\r\nclimate under consideration, it follows as a necessary consequence.\r\nIn fact, the amount of geological evidence which has already been\r\naccumulated in reference to inter-glacial periods may now be regarded\r\nas perfectly sufficient to establish the truth of that theory.\r\n\r\nIf the glacial epoch resulted from some accidental distribution of sea\r\nand land, then there may or may not have been more than one glacial\r\nepoch, but if it resulted from the cause which we have assigned, then\r\nthere must have been during the geological history of the globe a\r\nsuccession of glacial epochs corresponding to the secular variations\r\nin the eccentricity of the earth’s orbit. A belief in the existence\r\nof recurring glacial epochs has been steadily gaining ground for many\r\nyears past. I have, in Chapter XVIII., given at some length the facts\r\non which this belief rests. It is true that the geological evidence of\r\nglacial epochs in prior ages is meagre in comparison with that of the\r\nglacial epoch of Post-tertiary times; but there is a reason for this in\r\nthe nature of geological evidence itself. Chapter XVII. deals with the\r\ngeological records of former glacial epochs, showing that they are not\r\nonly imperfect, but that there is good reason why they should be so,\r\nand that the imperfection of the records in reference to them cannot be\r\nadvanced as an argument against their existence.\r\n\r\nIf the glacial epoch resulted from a high condition of eccentricity, we\r\nhave not only a means of determining the positive date of that epoch,\r\nbut we have also a means of determining geological time in absolute\r\nmeasure. For if the glacial epochs of prior ages correspond to periods\r\nof high eccentricity, then the intervals between those periods of high\r\neccentricity become the measure of the intervals between the glacial\r\nepochs. The researches of Lagrange and Leverrier into the secular\r\nvariations of the elements of the orbits of the planets enable us\r\nto determine with tolerable accuracy the values of the eccentricity\r\nof the earth’s orbit for, at least, four millions of years past and\r\nfuture. With the view of determining those values, I several years\r\nago computed from Leverrier’s formula the eccentricity of the earth’s\r\norbit and longitude of the perihelion, at intervals of ten thousand and\r\nfifty thousand years during a period of three millions of years in the\r\npast, and one million of years in the future. The tables containing\r\nthese values will be found in Chapter XIX. These tables not only give\r\nus the date of the glacial epoch, but they afford, as will be seen\r\nfrom Chapter XXI., evidence as to the probable date of the Eocene and\r\nMiocene periods.\r\n\r\nTen years ago, when the theory was first advanced, it was beset by\r\na very formidable difficulty, arising from the opinions which then\r\nprevailed in reference to geological time. One or two glacial epochs in\r\nthe course of a million of years was a conclusion which at that time\r\nscarcely any geologist would admit, and most would have felt inclined\r\nto have placed the last glacial epoch at least one million of years\r\nback. But then if we assume that the glacial epoch was due to a high\r\nstate of eccentricity, we should be compelled to admit of at least two\r\nglacial epochs during that lapse of time. It was the modern doctrine\r\nthat the great changes undergone by the earth’s crust were produced,\r\nnot by convulsions of nature, but by the slow and almost imperceptible\r\naction, of rain, rivers, snow, frost, ice, &c., which impressed so\r\nstrongly on the mind of the geologist the vast duration of geological\r\nperiods. When it was considered that the rocky face of our globe had\r\nbeen carved into hills and dales, and ultimately worn down to the\r\nsea-level by means of those apparently trifling agents, not only once\r\nor twice, but many times, during past ages, it was not surprising that\r\nthe views entertained by geologists regarding the immense antiquity of\r\nour globe should not have harmonised with the deductions of physical\r\nscience on the subject. It had been shown by Sir William Thomson and\r\nothers, from physical considerations relating to the age of the sun’s\r\nheat and the secular cooling of our globe, that the geological history\r\nof our earth’s crust must be limited to a period of something like\r\none hundred millions of years. But these speculations had but little\r\nweight when pitted against the stern and undeniable facts of subaërial\r\ndenudation. How, then, were the two to be reconciled? Was it the\r\nphysicist who had under-estimated geological time, or the geologist\r\nwho had over-estimated it? Few familiar with modern physics, and who\r\nhave given special attention to the subject, would admit that the sun\r\ncould have been dissipating his heat at the present enormous rate for\r\na period much beyond one hundred millions of years. The probability\r\nwas that the amount of work performed on the earth’s crust by the\r\ndenuding agents in a period so immense as a million of years was, for\r\nreasons stated in Chapter XX., very much under-estimated. But the\r\ndifficulty was how to prove this. How was it possible to measure the\r\nrate of operation of agents so numerous and diversified acting with\r\nsuch extreme slowness and irregularity over so immense areas? In other\r\nwords, how was it possible to measure the rate of subaërial denudation?\r\nPondering over this problem about ten years ago, an extremely simple\r\nand obvious method of solving it suggested itself to my mind. This\r\nmethod—the details of which will be found in Chapter XX.—showed that\r\nthe rate of subaërial denudation is enormously greater than had been\r\nsupposed. The method is now pretty generally accepted, and the result\r\nhas already been to bring about a complete reconciliation between\r\nphysics and geology in reference to time.\r\n\r\nChapter XXI. contains an account of the gravitation theories of the\r\norigin of the sun’s heat. The energy possessed by the sun is generally\r\nsupposed to have been derived from gravitation, combustion being\r\ntotally inadequate as a source. But something more than gravitation\r\nis required before we can account for even one hundred millions of\r\nyears’ heat. Gravitation could not supply even one-half that amount.\r\nThere must be some other and greater source than that of gravitation.\r\nThere is, however, as is indicated, an obvious source from which far\r\nmore energy may have been derived than could have been obtained from\r\ngravitation.\r\n\r\nThe method of determining the rate of subaërial denudation enables us\r\nalso to arrive at a rough estimate of the actual mean thickness of the\r\nstratified rocks of the globe. It will be seen from Chapter XXII. that\r\nthe mean thickness is far less than is generally supposed.\r\n\r\nThe physical cause of the submergence of the land during the glacial\r\nepoch, and the influence of change in the obliquity of the ecliptic on\r\nclimate, are next considered. In Chapter XXVI. I have given the reasons\r\nwhich induce me to believe that coal is an inter-glacial formation.\r\n\r\nThe next two chapters—the one on the path of the ice in north-western\r\nEurope, the other on the north of England ice-sheet—are reprints of\r\npapers which appeared a few years ago in the _Geological Magazine_.\r\nRecent observations have confirmed the truth of the views advanced\r\nin these two chapters, and they are rapidly gaining acceptance among\r\ngeologists.\r\n\r\nI have given, at the conclusion, a statement of the molecular theory of\r\nglacier motion—a theory which I have been led to modify considerably on\r\none particular point.\r\n\r\nThere is one point to which I wish particularly to direct\r\nattention—viz., that I have studiously avoided introducing into the\r\ntheories propounded anything of a hypothetical nature. There is not,\r\nso far as I am aware, from beginning to end of this volume, a single\r\nhypothetical element: nowhere have I attempted to give a hypothetical\r\nexplanation. The conclusions are in every case derived either from\r\nfacts or from what I believe to be admitted principles. In short, I\r\nhave aimed to prove that the theory of secular changes of climate\r\nfollows, as a necessary consequence, from the admitted principles of\r\nphysical science.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n     OCEANS-CURRENTS IN RELATION TO THE DISTRIBUTION OF HEAT OVER\r\n                              THE GLOBE.\r\n\r\n  The absolute Heating-power of Ocean-currents.—Volume of\r\n      the Gulf-stream.—Absolute Amount of Heat conveyed by\r\n      it.—Greater Portion of Moisture in inter-tropical Regions\r\n      falls as Rain in those Regions.—Land along the Equator\r\n      tends to lower the Temperature of the Globe.—Influence\r\n      of Gulf-stream on Climate of Europe.—Temperature of\r\n      Space.—Radiation of a Particle.—Professor Dove on Normal\r\n      Temperature.—Temperature of Equator and Poles in the Absence\r\n      of Ocean-currents.—Temperature of London, how much due to\r\n      Ocean-currents.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The absolute Heating-power of Ocean-currents._—There is perhaps no\r\nphysical agent concerned in the distribution of heat over the surface\r\nof the globe the influence of which has been so much underrated as that\r\nof ocean-currents. This is, no doubt, owing to the fact that although\r\ntheir surface-temperature, direction, and general influence have\r\nobtained considerable attention, yet little or nothing has been done\r\ntowards determining the absolute amount of heat or of cold conveyed by\r\nthem or the resulting absolute increase or decrease of temperature.\r\n\r\nThe modern method of determining the amount of heat-effects in absolute\r\nmeasure is, doubtless, destined to cast new light on all questions\r\nconnected with climate, as it has done, and is still doing, in every\r\ndepartment of physics where energy, under the form of heat, is being\r\nstudied. But this method has hardly as yet been attempted in questions\r\nof meteorology; and owing to the complicated nature of the phenomena\r\nwith which the meteorologist has generally to deal, its application\r\nwill very often prove practically impossible. Nevertheless, it is\r\nparticularly suitable to all questions relating to the direct thermal\r\neffects of currents, whatever the nature of these currents may happen\r\nto be.\r\n\r\nIn the application of the method to an ocean-current, the two most\r\nimportant elements required as data are the volume of the stream and\r\nits mean temperature. But although we know something of the temperature\r\nof most of the great ocean-currents, yet, with the exception of the\r\nGulf-stream, little has been ascertained regarding their volume.\r\n\r\nThe breadth, depth, and temperature of the Gulf-stream have formed the\r\nsubject of extensive and accurate observations by the United States\r\nCoast Survey. In the memoirs and charts of that survey cross-sections\r\nof the stream at various places are given, showing its breadth and\r\ndepth, and also the temperature of the water from the surface to the\r\nbottom. We are thus enabled to determine with some precision the\r\nmean temperature of the stream. And knowing its mean velocity at any\r\ngiven section, we have likewise a means of determining the number of\r\ncubic feet of water passing through that section in a given time. But\r\nalthough we can obtain with tolerable accuracy the mean temperature,\r\nyet observations regarding the velocity of the water at all depths have\r\nunfortunately not been made at any particular section. Consequently we\r\nhave no means of estimating as accurately as we could wish the volume\r\nof the current. Nevertheless, since we know the surface-velocity of the\r\nwater at places where some of the sections were taken, we are enabled\r\nto make at least a rough estimate of the volume.\r\n\r\nFrom an examination of the published sections, I came to the conclusion\r\nsome years ago[11] that the total quantity of water conveyed by the\r\nstream is probably equal to that of a stream fifty miles broad and\r\n1,000 feet deep,[12] flowing at the rate of four miles an hour,\r\nand that the mean temperature of the entire mass of moving water is\r\nnot under 65° at the moment of leaving the Gulf. But to prevent the\r\npossibility of any objections being raised on the grounds that I may\r\nhave over-estimated the volume of the stream, I shall take the velocity\r\nto be _two_ miles instead of four miles an hour. We are warranted,\r\nI think, in concluding that the stream before it returns from its\r\nnorthern journey is on an average cooled down to at least 40°,[13]\r\nconsequently it loses 25° of heat. Each cubic foot of water, therefore,\r\nin this case carries from the tropics for distribution upwards of\r\n1,158,000 foot-pounds of heat. According to the above estimate of the\r\nsize and velocity of the stream, which in Chapter XI. will be shown\r\nto be an under-estimate, 2,787,840,000,000 cubic feet of water are\r\nconveyed from the Gulf per hour, or 66,908,160,000,000 cubic feet\r\ndaily. Consequently the total quantity of heat thus transferred per day\r\namounts to 77,479,650,000,000,000,000 foot-pounds.\r\n\r\nThis estimate of the volume of the stream is considerably less by\r\none-half than that given both by Captain Maury and by Sir John\r\nHerschel. Captain Maury considers the Gulf-stream equal to a stream\r\nthirty-two miles broad and 1,200 feet deep, flowing at the rate of five\r\nknots an hour.[14] This gives 6,165,700,000,000 cubic feet per hour\r\nas the quantity of water conveyed by this stream. Sir John Herschel’s\r\nestimate is still greater. He considers it equal to a stream thirty\r\nmiles broad and 2,200 feet deep, flowing at the rate of four miles\r\nan hour.[15] This makes the quantity 7,359,900,000,000 cubic feet\r\nper hour. Dr. Colding, in his elaborate memoir on the Gulf-stream,\r\nestimates the volume at 5,760,000,000,000 cubic feet per hour, while\r\nMr. Laughton’s estimate is nearly double that of mine.\r\n\r\nFrom observations made by Sir John Herschel and by M. Pouillet on the\r\ndirect heat of the sun, it is found that, were no heat absorbed by the\r\natmosphere, about eighty-three foot-pounds per second would fall upon\r\na square foot of surface placed at right angles to the sun’s rays.[16]\r\nMr. Meech estimates that the quantity of heat cut off by the atmosphere\r\nis equal to about twenty-two per cent. of the total amount received\r\nfrom the sun. M. Pouillet estimates the loss at twenty-four per cent.\r\nTaking the former estimate, 64·74 foot-pounds per second will therefore\r\nbe the quantity of heat falling on a square foot of the earth’s surface\r\nwhen the sun is in the zenith. And were the sun to remain stationary in\r\nthe zenith for twelve hours, 2,796,768 foot-pounds would fall upon the\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nIt can be shown that the total amount of heat received upon a unit\r\nsurface on the equator, during the twelve hours from sunrise till\r\nsunset at the time of the equinoxes, is to the total amount which\r\nwould be received upon that surface, were the sun to remain in the\r\nzenith during those twelve hours, as the diameter of a circle to half\r\nits circumference, or as 1 to 1·5708. It follows, therefore, that\r\na square foot of surface on the equator receives from the sun at\r\nthe time of the equinoxes 1,780,474 foot-pounds daily, and a square\r\nmile 49,636,750,000,000 foot-pounds daily. But this amounts to only\r\n1/1560935th part of the quantity of heat daily conveyed from the\r\ntropics by the Gulf-stream. In other words, the Gulf-stream conveys as\r\nmuch heat as is received from the sun by 1,560,935 square miles at the\r\nequator. The amount thus conveyed is equal to all the heat which falls\r\nupon the globe within thirty-two miles on each side of the equator.\r\nAccording to calculations made by Mr. Meech,[17] the annual quantity\r\nof heat received by a unit surface on the frigid zone, taking the\r\nmean of the whole zone, is 5·45/12th of that received at the equator;\r\nconsequently the quantity of heat conveyed by the Gulf-stream in one\r\nyear is equal to the heat which falls on an average on 3,436,900\r\nsquare miles of the arctic regions. The frigid zone or arctic regions\r\ncontain 8,130,000 square miles. There is actually, therefore, nearly\r\none-half as much heat transferred from tropical regions by the\r\nGulf-stream as is received from the sun by the entire arctic regions,\r\nthe quantity conveyed from the tropics by the stream to that received\r\nfrom the sun by the arctic regions being nearly as two to five.\r\n\r\nBut we have been assuming in our calculations that the percentage of\r\nheat absorbed by the atmosphere is no greater in polar regions than\r\nit is at the equator, which is not the case. If we make due allowance\r\nfor the extra amount absorbed in polar regions in consequence of the\r\nobliqueness of the sun’s rays, the total quantity of heat conveyed by\r\nthe Gulf-stream will probably be nearly equal to one-half the amount\r\nreceived from the sun by the entire arctic regions.\r\n\r\nIf we compare the quantity of heat conveyed by the Gulf-stream with\r\nthat conveyed by means of aërial currents, the result is equally\r\nstartling. The density of air to that of water is as 1 to 770, and\r\nits specific heat to that of water is as 1 to 4·2; consequently the\r\nsame amount of heat that would raise 1 cubic foot of water 1° would\r\nraise 770 cubic feet of air 4°·2, or 3,234 cubic feet 1°. The quantity\r\nof heat conveyed by the Gulf-stream is therefore equal to that which\r\nwould be conveyed by a current of air 3,234 times the volume of the\r\nGulf-stream, at the same temperature and moving with the same velocity.\r\nTaking, as before, the width of the stream at fifty miles, and its\r\ndepth at 1,000 feet, and its velocity at two miles an hour, it follows\r\nthat, in order to convey an equal amount of heat from the tropics by\r\nmeans of an aërial current, it would be necessary to have a current\r\nabout 1¼ mile deep, and at the temperature of 65°, blowing at the\r\nrate of two miles an hour from every part of the equator over the\r\nnorthern hemisphere towards the pole. If its velocity were equal to\r\nthat of a good sailing-breeze, which Sir John Herschel states to be\r\nabout twenty-one miles an hour, the current would require to be above\r\n600 feet deep. A greater quantity of heat is probably conveyed by the\r\nGulf-stream alone from the tropical to the temperate and arctic regions\r\nthan by all the aërial currents which flow from the equator.\r\n\r\nWe are apt, on the other hand, to over-estimate the amount of the heat\r\nconveyed from tropical regions to us by means of aërial currents. The\r\nonly currents which flow from the equatorial regions are the upper\r\ncurrents, or anti-trades as they are called. But it is not possible\r\nthat much heat can be conveyed directly by them. The upper currents of\r\nthe trade-winds, even at the equator, are nowhere below the snow-line;\r\nthey must therefore lie in a region of which the temperature is\r\nactually below the freezing-point. In fact, if those currents were\r\nwarm, they would elevate the snow-line above themselves. The heated air\r\nrising off the hot burning ground at the equator, after ascending a\r\nfew miles, becomes exposed to the intense cold of the upper regions of\r\nthe atmosphere; it then very soon loses all its heat, and returns from\r\nthe equator much colder than it went thither. It is impossible that\r\nwe can receive any heat directly from the equatorial regions by means\r\nof aërial currents. It is perfectly true that the south-west wind, to\r\nwhich we owe so much of our warmth in this country, is a continuation\r\nof the anti-trade; but the heat which this wind brings to us is not\r\nderived from the equatorial regions. This will appear evident, if we\r\nbut reflect that, before the upper current descends to the snow-line\r\nafter leaving the equator, it must traverse a space of at least 2,000\r\nmiles; and to perform this long journey several days will be required.\r\nDuring all this time the air is in a region below the freezing-point;\r\nand it is perfectly obvious that by the time it begins to descend it\r\nmust have acquired the temperature of the region in which it has been\r\ntravelling.\r\n\r\nIf such be the case, it is evident that a wind whose temperature\r\nis below 32° could never warm a country such as ours, where the\r\ntemperature does not fall below 38° or 39°. The heat of our south-west\r\nwinds is derived, not directly from the equator, but from the warm\r\nwater of the Atlantic—in fact, from the Gulf-stream. The upper current\r\nacquires its heat after it descends to the earth. There is one way,\r\nhowever, whereby heat is indirectly conveyed from the equator by the\r\nanti-trades; that is, in the form of aqueous vapour. In the formation\r\nof one pound of water from aqueous vapour, as Professor Tyndall\r\nstrikingly remarks, a quantity of heat is given out sufficient to melt\r\nfive pounds of cast iron.[18] It must, however, be borne in mind that\r\nthe greater part of the moisture of the south-west and west winds is\r\nderived from the ocean in temperate regions. The upper current receives\r\nthe greater part of its moisture after it descends to the earth, whilst\r\nthe moisture received at the equator is in great part condensed, and\r\nfalls as rain in those regions.\r\n\r\nThis latter assertion has been so frequently called in question\r\nthat I shall give my reasons for making it. According to Dr. Keith\r\nJohnston (“Physical Atlas”) the mean rainfall of the torrid regions\r\nis ninety-six inches per annum, while that of the temperate regions\r\namounts to only thirty-seven inches. If the greater part of the\r\nmoisture of the torrid regions does not fall as rain in those regions,\r\nit must fall as such beyond them. Now the area of the torrid to that\r\nof the two temperate regions is about as 39·3 to 51. Consequently\r\nninety-six inches of rain spread over the temperate regions would give\r\nseventy-four inches; but this is double the actual rainfall of the\r\ntemperate regions. If, again, it were spread over both temperate and\r\npolar regions this would yield sixty-four inches, which, however, is\r\nnearly double the mean rainfall of the temperate and polar regions. If\r\nwe add to this the amount of moisture derived from the ocean within\r\ntemperate and polar regions, we should have a far greater rainfall for\r\nthese latitudes than for the torrid region, and we know, of course,\r\nthat it is actually far less. This proves the truth of the assertion\r\nthat by far the greater part of the moisture of the torrid regions\r\nfalls in those regions as rain. It will hardly do to object that the\r\nabove may probably be an over-estimate of the amount of rainfall in\r\nthe torrid zone, for it is not at all likely that any error will ever\r\nbe found which will affect the general conclusion at which we have\r\narrived.\r\n\r\nDr. Carpenter, in proof of the small rainfall of the torrid zone,\r\nadduces the case of the Red Sea, where, although evaporation is\r\nexcessive, almost no rain falls. But the reason why the vapour raised\r\nfrom the Red Sea does not fall in that region as rain, is no doubt\r\nowing to the fact that this sea is only a narrow strip of water in a\r\ndry and parched land, the air above which is too greedy of moisture\r\nto admit of the vapour being deposited as rain. Over a wide expanse\r\nof ocean, however, where the air above is kept to a great extent in a\r\nconstant state of saturation, the case is totally different.\r\n\r\n_Land at the Equator tends to Lower the Temperature of the Globe._—The\r\nforegoing considerations, as well as many others which might be stated,\r\nlead to the conclusion that, in order to raise the mean temperature of\r\nthe whole earth, _water_ should be placed along the equator, and not\r\n_land_, as is supposed by Sir Charles Lyell and others. For if land is\r\nplaced at the equator, the possibility of conveying the sun’s heat from\r\nthe equatorial regions by means of ocean-currents is prevented. The\r\ntransference of heat could then be effected only by means of the upper\r\ncurrents of the trades; for the heat conveyed by _conduction_ along the\r\nsolid crust, if any, can have no sensible effect on climate. But these\r\ncurrents, as we have just seen, are ill-adapted for conveying heat.\r\n\r\nThe surface of the ground at the equator becomes intensely heated by\r\nthe sun’s rays. This causes it to radiate its heat more rapidly into\r\nspace than a surface of water heated under the same conditions. Again,\r\nthe air in contact with the hot ground becomes also more rapidly\r\nheated than in contact with water, and consequently the ascending\r\ncurrent of air carries off a greater amount of heat. But were the\r\nheat thus carried away transferred by means of the upper currents to\r\nhigh latitudes and there employed to warm the earth, then it might to\r\na considerable extent compensate for the absence of ocean-currents,\r\nand in this case land at the equator might be nearly as well adapted\r\nas water for raising the temperature of the whole earth. But such is\r\nnot the case; for the heat carried up by the ascending current at the\r\nequator is not employed in warming the earth, but is thrown off into\r\nthe cold stellar space above. This ascending current, instead of being\r\nemployed in warming the globe, is in reality one of the most effectual\r\nmeans that the earth has of getting quit of the heat received from the\r\nsun, and of thus maintaining a much lower temperature than it would\r\notherwise possess. It is in the equatorial regions that the earth loses\r\nas well as gains the greater part of its heat; so that, of all places,\r\nhere ought to be placed the substance best adapted for preventing the\r\ndissipation of the earth’s heat into space, in order to raise the\r\ngeneral temperature of the earth. Water, of all substances in nature,\r\nseems to possess this quality to the greatest extent; and, besides, it\r\nis a fluid, and therefore adapted by means of currents to carry the\r\nheat which it receives from the sun to every region of the globe.\r\n\r\nThese results show (although they have reference to only one stream)\r\nthat the general influence of ocean-currents on the distribution of\r\nheat over the surface of the globe must be very great. If the quantity\r\nof heat transferred from equatorial regions by the Gulf-stream\r\nalone is nearly equal to all the heat received from the sun by the\r\narctic regions, then how enormous must be the quantity conveyed from\r\nequatorial regions by all the ocean-currents together!\r\n\r\n_Influence of the Gulf-stream on the Climate of Europe._—In a paper\r\nread before the British Association at Exeter, Mr. A. G. Findlay\r\nobjects to the conclusions at which I have arrived in former papers\r\non the subject, that I have not taken into account the great length\r\nof time that the water requires in order to circulate, and the\r\ninterference it has to encounter in its passage.\r\n\r\nThe objection is, that a stream so comparatively small as the\r\nGulf-stream, after spreading out over such a large area of the\r\nAtlantic, and moving so slowly across to the shores of Europe, losing\r\nheat all the way, would not be able to produce any very sensible\r\ninfluence on the climate of Europe.\r\n\r\nI am unable to perceive the force of this objection. Why, the very\r\nefficiency of the stream as a heating agent necessarily depends upon\r\nthe slowness of its motion. Did the Gulf-stream move as rapidly along\r\nits whole course as it does in the Straits of Florida, it could produce\r\nno sensible effect on the climate of Europe. It does not require much\r\nconsideration to perceive this. (1) If the stream during its course\r\ncontinued narrow, deep, and rapid, it would have little opportunity of\r\nlosing its heat, and the water would carry back to the tropics the heat\r\nwhich it ought to have given off in the temperate and polar regions.\r\n(2) The Gulf-stream does not heat the shores of Europe by direct\r\nradiation. Our island, for example, is not heated by radiation from a\r\nstream of warm water flowing along its shores. The Gulf-stream heats\r\nour island _indirectly_ by heating the winds which blow over it to our\r\nshores.\r\n\r\nThe anti-trades, or upper return-currents, as we have seen, bring no\r\nheat from the tropical regions. After traversing some 2,000 miles\r\nin a region of extreme cold they descend on the Atlantic as a cold\r\ncurrent, and there absorb the heat and moisture which they carry to\r\nnorth-eastern Europe. Those aërial currents derive their heat from the\r\nGulf-stream, or if it is preferred, from the warm water poured into the\r\nAtlantic by the Gulf-stream.\r\n\r\nHow, then, are these winds heated by the warm water? The air is heated\r\nin two ways, viz., by direct _radiation_ from the water, and by\r\n_contact_ with the water. Now, if the Gulf-stream continued a narrow\r\nand deep current during its entire course similar to what it is at\r\nthe Straits of Florida, it could have little or no opportunity of\r\ncommunicating its heat to the air either by radiation or by contact. If\r\nthe stream were only about forty or fifty miles in breadth, the aërial\r\nparticles in their passage across it would not be in contact with the\r\nwarm water more than an hour or two. Moreover, the number of particles\r\nin contact with the water, owing to the narrowness of the stream,\r\nwould be small, and there would therefore be little opportunity for\r\nthe air becoming heated by contact. The same also holds true in regard\r\nto radiation. The more we widen the stream and increase its area, the\r\nmore we increase its radiating surface; and the greater the radiating\r\nsurface, the greater is the quantity of heat thrown off. But this is\r\nnot all; the number of aërial particles heated by radiation increases\r\nin proportion to the area of the radiating surface; consequently, the\r\nwider the area over which the waters of the Gulf-stream are spread,\r\nthe more effectual will the stream be as a heating agent. And, again,\r\nin order that a very wide area of the Atlantic may be covered with the\r\nwarm waters of the stream, slowness of motion is essential.\r\n\r\nMr. Findlay supposes that fully one-half of the Gulf-stream passes into\r\nthe south-eastern branch, and that it is only the north-eastern branch\r\nof the current that can be effectual in raising the temperature of\r\nEurope. But it appears to me that it is to this south-eastern portion\r\nof the current, and not to the north-eastern, that we, in this country,\r\nare chiefly indebted for our heat. The south-west winds, to which we\r\nowe our heat, derive their temperature from this south-eastern portion\r\nwhich flows away in the direction of the Azores. The south-west winds\r\nwhich blow over the northern portion of the current which flows past\r\nour island up into the arctic seas cannot possibly cross this country,\r\nbut will go to heat Norway and northern Europe. The north-eastern\r\nportion of the stream, no doubt, protects us from the ice of Greenland\r\nby warming the north-west winds which come to us from that cold region.\r\n\r\nMr. Buchan, Secretary of the Scottish Meteorological Society, has\r\nshown[19] that in a large tract of the Atlantic between latitudes 20°\r\nand 40° N., the mean pressure of the atmosphere is greater than in any\r\nother place on the globe. To the west of Madeira, between longitude\r\n10° and 40° W., the mean annual pressure amounts to 30·2 inches, while\r\nbetween Iceland and Spitzbergen it is only 29·6, a lower mean pressure\r\nthan is found in any other place on the northern hemisphere. There\r\nmust consequently, he concludes, be a general tendency in the air to\r\nflow from the former to the latter place along the earth’s surface.\r\nNow, the air in moving from the lower to the higher latitudes tends\r\nto take a north-easterly direction, and in this case will pass over\r\nour island in its course. This region of high pressure, however,\r\nis situated in the very path of the south-eastern branch of the\r\nGulf-stream, and consequently the winds blowing therefrom will carry\r\ndirectly to Britain the heat of the Gulf-stream.\r\n\r\nAs we shall presently see, it is as essential to the heating of our\r\nisland as to that of the southern portion of Europe, that a very large\r\nproportion of the waters of the Gulf-stream should spread over the\r\nsurface of the Atlantic and never pass up into the arctic regions.\r\n\r\nEven according to Mr. Findlay’s own theory, it is to the south-west\r\nwind, heated by the warm waters of the Atlantic, that we are indebted\r\nfor the high temperature of our climate. But he seems to be under the\r\nimpression that the Atlantic would be able to supply the necessary\r\nheat independently of the Gulf-stream. This, it seems to me, is the\r\nfundamental error of all those who doubt the efficiency of the stream.\r\nIt is a mistake, however, into which one is very apt to fall who does\r\nnot adopt the more rigid method of determining heat-results in absolute\r\nmeasure. When we apply this method, we find that the Atlantic, without\r\nthe aid of such a current as the Gulf-stream, would be wholly unable to\r\nsupply the necessary amount of heat to the south-west winds.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of heat conveyed by the Gulf-stream, as we have seen,\r\nis equal to all the heat received from the sun by 1,560,935 square\r\nmiles at the equator. The mean annual quantity of heat received from\r\nthe sun by the temperate regions per unit surface is to that received\r\nby the equator as 9·08 to 12.[20] Consequently, the quantity of heat\r\nconveyed by the stream is equal to all the heat received from the sun\r\nby 2,062,960 square miles of the temperate regions. The total area of\r\nthe Atlantic from the latitude of the Straits of Florida, 200 miles\r\nnorth of the tropic of Cancer, up to the Arctic Circle, including also\r\nthe German Ocean, is about 8,500,000 square miles. In this case the\r\nquantity of heat carried by the Gulf-stream into the Atlantic through\r\nthe Straits of Florida, is to that received by this entire area from\r\nthe sun as 1 to 4·12, or in round numbers as 1 to 4. It therefore\r\nfollows that one-fifth of all the heat possessed by the waters of the\r\nAtlantic over that area, even supposing that they absorb every ray that\r\nfalls upon them, is derived from the Gulf-stream. Would those who call\r\nin question the efficiency of the Gulf-stream be willing to admit that\r\na decrease of one-fourth in the total amount of heat received from the\r\nsun, over the entire area of the Atlantic from within 200 miles of\r\nthe tropical zone up to the arctic regions, would not sensibly affect\r\nthe climate of northern Europe? If they would not willingly admit\r\nthis, why, then, contend that the Gulf-stream does not affect climate?\r\nfor the stoppage of the Gulf-stream would deprive the Atlantic of\r\n77,479,650,000,000,000,000 foot-pounds of energy in the form of heat\r\nper day, a quantity equal to one-fourth of all the heat received from\r\nthe sun by that area.\r\n\r\nHow much, then, of the temperature of the south-west winds derived from\r\nthe water of the Atlantic is due to the Gulf-stream?\r\n\r\nWere the sun extinguished, the temperature over the whole earth\r\nwould sink to _nearly_ that of stellar space, which, according to\r\nthe investigations of Sir John Herschel[21] and of M. Pouillet,[22]\r\nis not above −239° F. Were the earth possessed of no atmosphere, the\r\ntemperature of its surface would sink to exactly that of space, or to\r\nthat indicated by a thermometer exposed to no other heat-influence than\r\nthat of radiation from the stars. But the presence of the atmospheric\r\nenvelope would slightly modify the conditions of things; for the\r\nheat from the stars (which of course constitutes what is called the\r\ntemperature of space) would, like the sun’s heat, pass more freely\r\nthrough the atmosphere than the heat radiated back from the earth, and\r\nthere would in consequence of this be an accumulation of heat on the\r\nearth’s surface. The temperature would therefore stand a little higher\r\nthan that of space; or, in other words, it would stand a little higher\r\nthan it would otherwise do were the earth exposed in space to the\r\ndirect radiation of the stars without the atmospheric envelope. But,\r\nfor reasons which will presently be stated, we may in the meantime,\r\ntill further light is cast upon this matter, take -239° F. as probably\r\nnot far from what would be the temperature of the earth’s surface were\r\nthe sun extinguished.\r\n\r\nSuppose now that we take the mean annual temperature of the Atlantic\r\nat, say, 56°.[23] Then 239° + 56° = 295° represents the number of\r\ndegrees of rise due to the heat which it receives. In other words,\r\nit takes all the heat that the Atlantic receives to maintain its\r\ntemperature 295° above the temperature of space. Stop the Gulf-stream,\r\nand the Atlantic would be deprived of one-fifth of the heat which\r\nit possesses. Then, if it takes five parts of heat to maintain a\r\ntemperature of 295° above that of space, the four parts which would\r\nremain after the stream was stopped would only be able to maintain a\r\ntemperature of four-fifths of 295°, or 236° above that of space: the\r\nstoppage of the Gulf-stream would therefore deprive the Atlantic of an\r\namount of heat which would be sufficient to maintain its temperature\r\n59° above what it would otherwise be, did it depend alone upon the heat\r\nreceived directly from the sun. It does not, of course, follow that\r\nthe Gulf-stream actually maintains the temperature 59° above what it\r\nwould otherwise be were there no ocean-currents, because the actual\r\nheating-effect of the stream is neutralized to a very considerable\r\nextent by cold currents from the arctic regions. But 59° of rise\r\nrepresents its actual power; consequently 59°, minus the lowering\r\neffect of the cold currents, represents the actual rise. What the rise\r\nmay amount to at any particular place must be determined by other means.\r\n\r\nThis method of calculating how much the temperature of the earth’s\r\nsurface would rise or fall from an increase or a decrease in the\r\nabsolute amount of heat received is that adopted by Sir John Herschel\r\nin his “Outlines of Astronomy,” § 369^a.\r\n\r\nAbout three years ago, in an article in the _Reader_, I endeavoured\r\nto show that this method is not rigidly correct. It has been shown\r\nfrom the experiments of Dulong and Petit, Dr. Balfour Stewart,\r\nProfessor Draper, and others, that the rate at which a body radiates\r\nits heat off into space is not directly proportionate to its absolute\r\ntemperature. The rate at which a body loses its heat as its temperature\r\nrises increases more rapidly than the temperature. As a body rises\r\nin temperature the rate at which it radiates off its heat increases;\r\nthe _rate_ of this increase, however, is not uniform, but increases\r\nwith the temperature. Consequently the temperature is not lowered in\r\nproportion to the decrease of the sun’s heat. But at the comparatively\r\nlow temperature with which we have at present to deal, the error\r\nresulting from assuming the decrease of temperature to be proportionate\r\nto the decrease of heat would not be great.\r\n\r\nIt may be remarked, however, that the experiments referred to were\r\nmade on solids; but, from certain results arrived at by Dr. Balfour\r\nStewart, it would seem that the radiation of a material particle may\r\nbe proportionate to its absolute temperature.[24] This physicist found\r\nthat the radiation of a thick plate of glass increases more rapidly\r\nthan that of a thin plate as the temperature rises, and that, if we go\r\non continually diminishing the thickness of the plate whose radiation\r\nat different temperatures we are ascertaining, we find that as it grows\r\nthinner and thinner the rate at which it radiates off its heat as its\r\ntemperature rises becomes less and less. In other words, as the plate\r\ngrows thinner and thinner its rate of radiation becomes more and more\r\nproportionate to its absolute temperature. And we can hardly resist the\r\nconviction that if we could possibly go on diminishing the thickness\r\nof the plate till we reached a film so thin as to embrace but only one\r\nparticle in its thickness, its rate of radiation would be proportionate\r\nto its temperature. Dr. Balfour Stewart has very ingeniously suggested\r\nthe probable reason why the rate of radiation of thick plates increases\r\nwith rise of temperature more rapidly than that of thin. It is this:\r\nall substances are more diathermanous for heat of high temperatures\r\nthan for heat of low temperatures. When a body is at a low temperature,\r\nwe may suppose that only the exterior rows of particles supply the\r\nradiation, the heat from the interior particles being all stopped by\r\nthe exterior ones, the substance being very opaque for heat of low\r\ntemperature; while at a high temperature we may imagine that part\r\nof the heat from the interior particles is allowed to pass, thereby\r\nswelling the total radiation. But as the plate becomes thinner and\r\nthinner, the obstructions to interior radiation become less and less,\r\nand as these obstructions are greater for radiation at low temperatures\r\nthan for radiation at high temperatures, it necessarily follows that,\r\nby reducing the thickness of the plate, we assist radiation at low\r\ntemperatures more than we do at high.\r\n\r\nIn a gas, where each particle may be assumed to radiate by itself, and\r\nwhere the particles stand at a considerable distance from one another,\r\nthe obstruction to interior radiation must be far less than in a\r\nsolid. In this case the rate at which a gas radiates off its heat as\r\nits temperature rises must increase more slowly than that of a solid\r\nsubstance. In other words, its rate of radiation must correspond more\r\nnearly to its absolute temperature than that of a solid. If this be the\r\ncase, a reduction in the amount of heat received from the sun, owing to\r\nan increase of his distance, should tend to produce a greater lowering\r\neffect on the temperature of the air than it does on the temperature of\r\nthe solid ground. But as the temperature of our climate is determined\r\nby the temperature of the air, it must follow that the error of\r\nassuming that the decrease of temperature would be proportionate to the\r\ndecrease in the intensity of the sun’s heat may not be great.\r\n\r\nIt may be observed here, although it does not bear directly on this\r\npoint, that although the air in a room, for example, or at the earth’s\r\nsurface is principally cooled by convection rather than by radiation,\r\nyet it is by radiation alone that the earth’s atmosphere parts with its\r\nheat to stellar space; and this is the chief matter with which we are\r\nat present concerned. Air, like all other gases, is a bad radiator;\r\nand this tends to protect it from being cooled to such an extent as it\r\nwould otherwise be, were it a good radiator like solids. True, it is\r\nalso a bad absorber; but as it is cooled by radiation into space, and\r\nheated, not altogether by absorption, but to a very large extent by\r\nconvection, it on the whole gains its heat more easily than it loses\r\nit, and consequently must stand at a higher temperature than it would\r\ndo were it heated by absorption alone.\r\n\r\nBut, to return; the error of regarding the decrease of temperature\r\nas proportionate to the decrease in the amount of heat received, is\r\nprobably neutralized by one of an opposite nature, viz., that of taking\r\nspace at too high a temperature; for by so doing we make the result too\r\nsmall.\r\n\r\nWe know that absolute zero is at least 493° below the melting-point\r\nof ice. This is 222° below that of space. Consequently, if the heat\r\nderived from the stars is able to maintain a temperature of −239°,\r\nor 222° of absolute temperature, then nearly as much heat is derived\r\nfrom the stars as from the sun. But if so, why do the stars give so\r\nmuch heat and so very little light? If the radiation from the stars\r\ncould maintain a thermometer 222° above absolute zero, then space must\r\nbe far more transparent to heat-rays than to light-rays, or else the\r\nstars give out a great amount of heat, but very little light, neither\r\nof which suppositions is probably true. The probability is, I venture\r\nto presume, that the temperature of space is not very much above\r\nabsolute zero. At the time when these investigations into the probable\r\ntemperature of space were made, at least as regards the labours of\r\nPouillet, the modern science of heat had no existence, and little or\r\nnothing was then known with certainty regarding absolute zero. In this\r\ncase the whole matter would require to be reconsidered. The result of\r\nsuch an investigation in all probability would be to assign a lower\r\ntemperature to stellar space than −239°.\r\n\r\nTaking all these various considerations into account, it is probable\r\nthat if we adopt −239° as the temperature of space, we shall not be far\r\nfrom the truth in assuming that the absolute temperature of a place\r\nabove that of space is proportionate to the amount of heat received\r\nfrom the sun.\r\n\r\nWe may, therefore, in this case conclude that 59° of rise is probably\r\nnot very far from the truth, as representing the influence of the\r\nGulf-stream. The Gulf-stream, instead of producing little or no effect,\r\nproduces an effect far greater than is generally supposed.\r\n\r\nOur island has a mean annual temperature of about 12° above the normal\r\ndue to its latitude. This excess of temperature has been justly\r\nattributed to the influence of the Gulf-stream. But it is singular\r\nhow this excess should have been taken as the measure of the _rise\r\nresulting from the influence of the stream_. These figures only\r\nrepresent the number of degrees that the mean normal temperature of\r\nour island stands above what is called the normal temperature of the\r\nlatitude.\r\n\r\nThe mode in which Professor Dove constructed his Tables of normal\r\ntemperature was as follows:—He took the temperature of thirty-six\r\nequidistant points on every ten degrees of latitude. The mean\r\ntemperature of these thirty-six points he calls in each case the\r\n_normal_ temperature of the parallel. The excess above the normal\r\nmerely represents how much the stream raises our temperature above\r\nthe mean of all places on the same latitude, but it affords us no\r\ninformation regarding the absolute rise produced. In the Pacific, as\r\nwell as in the Atlantic, there are immense masses of water flowing\r\nfrom the tropical to the temperate regions. Now, unless we know how\r\nmuch of the normal temperature of a latitude is due to ocean-currents,\r\nand how much to the direct heat of the sun, we could not possibly,\r\nfrom Professor Dove’s Tables, form the most distant conjecture as\r\nto how much of our temperature is derived from the Gulf-stream. The\r\noverlooking of this fact has led to a general misconception regarding\r\nthe positive influence of the Gulf-stream on temperature. The 12°\r\nmarked in Tables of normal temperature do not represent the absolute\r\neffect of the stream, but merely show how much the stream raises the\r\ntemperature of our country above the mean of all places on the same\r\nlatitude. Other places have their temperature raised by ocean-currents\r\nas well as this country; only the Gulf-stream produces a rise of\r\nseveral degrees over and above that produced by other streams in the\r\nsame latitude.\r\n\r\nAt present there is a difference merely of 80° between the mean\r\ntemperature of the equator and the poles;[25] but were each part of the\r\nglobe’s surface to depend only upon the direct heat which it receives\r\nfrom the sun, there ought, according to theory, to be a difference of\r\nmore than 200°. The annual quantity of heat received at the equator is\r\nto that received at the poles (supposing the proportionate quantity\r\nabsorbed by the atmosphere to be the same in both cases) as 12 to 4·98,\r\nor, say, as 12 to 5. Consequently, if the temperatures of the equator\r\nand the poles be taken as proportionate to the absolute amount of heat\r\nreceived from the sun, then the temperature of the equator above that\r\nof space must be to that of the poles above that of space as 12 to 5.\r\nWhat ought, therefore, to be the temperatures of the equator and the\r\npoles, did each place depend solely upon the heat which it receives\r\ndirectly from the sun? Were all ocean and aërial currents stopped,\r\nso that there could be no transference of heat from one part of the\r\nearth’s surface to another, what ought to be the temperatures of the\r\nequator and the poles? We can at least arrive at a rough estimate\r\non this point. If we diminish the quantity of warm water conveyed\r\nfrom the equatorial regions to the temperate and arctic regions, the\r\ntemperature of the equator will begin to rise, and that of the poles\r\nto sink. It is probable, however, that this process would affect the\r\ntemperature of the poles more than it would that of the equator; for as\r\nthe warm water flows from the equator to the poles, the area over which\r\nit is spread becomes less and less. But as the water from the tropics\r\nhas to raise the temperature of the temperate regions as well as the\r\npolar, the difference of effect at the equator and poles might not, on\r\nthat account, be so very great. Let us take a rough estimate. Say that,\r\nas the temperature of the equator rises one degree, the temperature of\r\nthe poles sinks one degree and a half. The mean annual temperature of\r\nthe globe is about 58°. The mean temperature of the equator is 80°, and\r\nthat of the poles 0°. Let ocean and aërial currents now begin to cease,\r\nthe temperature of the equator commences to rise and the temperature\r\nof the poles to sink. For every degree that the temperature of the\r\nequator rises, that of the poles sinks 1½°; and when the currents are\r\nall stopped and each place becomes dependent solely upon the direct\r\nrays of the sun, the mean annual temperature of the equator above that\r\nof space will be to that of the poles, above that of space, as 12 to\r\n5. When this proportion is reached, the equator will be 374° above\r\nthat of space, and the poles 156°; for 374 is to 156 as 12 is to 5.\r\nThe temperature of space we have seen to be −239°, consequently the\r\ntemperature of the equator will in this case be 135°, reckoned from the\r\nzero of the Fahrenheit thermometer, and the poles 83° below zero. The\r\nequator would therefore be 55° warmer than at present, and the poles\r\n83° colder. The difference between the temperature of the equator and\r\nthe poles will in this case amount to 218°.\r\n\r\nNow, if we take into account the quantity of positive energy in the\r\nform of heat carried by warm currents from the equator to the temperate\r\nand polar regions, and also the quantity of negative energy (cold)\r\ncarried by cold currents from the polar regions to the equator, we\r\nshall find that they are sufficient to reduce the difference of\r\ntemperature between the poles and the equator from 218° to 80°.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of heat received in the latitude of London, for example,\r\nis to that received at the equator nearly as 12 to 8. This, according\r\nto theory, should produce a difference of about 125°. The temperature\r\nof the equator above that of space, as we have seen, would be 374°.\r\nTherefore 249° above that of space would represent the temperature\r\nof the latitude of London. This would give 10° as its temperature.\r\nThe stoppage of all ocean and aërial currents would thus increase the\r\ndifference between the equator and the latitude of London by about\r\n85°. The stoppage of ocean-currents would not be nearly so much felt,\r\nof course, in the latitude of London as at the equator and the poles,\r\nbecause, as has been already noticed, in all latitudes midway between\r\nthe equator and the poles the two sets of currents to a considerable\r\nextent compensate each other—the warm currents from the equator\r\nraise the temperature, while the cold ones from the poles lower it;\r\nbut as the warm currents chiefly keep on the surface and the cold\r\nreturn-currents are principally under-currents, the heating effect very\r\ngreatly exceeds the cooling effect. Now, as we have seen, the stoppage\r\nof all currents would raise the temperature of the equator 55°; that\r\nis to say, the rise at the equator alone would increase the difference\r\nof temperature between the equator and that of London by 55°. But the\r\nactual difference, as we have seen, ought to be 85°; consequently the\r\ntemperature of London would be lowered 30° by the stoppage of the\r\ncurrents. For if we raise the temperature of the equator 55° and lower\r\nthe temperature of London 30°, we then increase the difference by\r\n85°. The normal temperature of the latitude of London being 40°, the\r\nstoppage of all ocean and aërial currents would thus reduce it to 10°.\r\nBut the Gulf-stream raises the actual mean temperature of London 10°\r\nabove the normal. Consequently 30° + 10° = 40° represents the actual\r\nrise at London due to the influence of the Gulf-stream over and above\r\nall the lowering effects resulting from arctic currents. On some parts\r\nof the American shores on the latitude of London, the temperature is\r\n10° below the normal. The stoppage of all ocean and aërial currents\r\nwould therefore lower the temperature there only 20°.\r\n\r\nIt is at the equator and the poles that the great system of ocean and\r\naërial currents produces its maximum effects. The influence becomes\r\nless and less as we recede from those places, and between them there\r\nis a point where the influence of warm currents from the equator and\r\nof cold currents from the poles exactly neutralize each other. At\r\nthis point the stoppage of ocean-currents would not sensibly affect\r\ntemperature. This point, of course, is not situated on the same\r\nlatitude in all meridians, but varies according to the position of the\r\nmeridian in relation to land, and ocean-currents, whether cold or hot,\r\nand other circumstances. A line drawn round the globe through these\r\nvarious points would be very irregular. At one place, such as on the\r\nwestern side of the Atlantic, where the arctic current predominates,\r\nthe neutral line would be deflected towards the equator, while on\r\nthe eastern side, where warm currents predominate, the line would be\r\ndeflected towards the north. It is a difficult problem to determine the\r\nmean position of this line; it probably lies somewhere not far north of\r\nthe tropics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n    OCEAN-CURRENTS IN RELATION TO THE DISTRIBUTION OF HEAT OVER THE\r\n                         GLOBE.—(_Continued._)\r\n\r\n  Influence of the Gulf-stream on the Climate of the Arctic\r\n      Regions.—Absolute Amount of Heat received by the Arctic\r\n      Regions from the Sun.—Influence of Ocean-currents shown by\r\n      another Method.—Temperature of a Globe all Water or all\r\n      Land according to Professor J.

Are the\r\nseas around Spitzbergen and North Greenland heated by the warm water of\r\nthe stream?\r\n\r\nThose who deny this nevertheless admit the existence of an arctic\r\ncurrent. They admit that an immense mass of cold water is continually\r\nflowing south from the polar regions around Greenland into the\r\nAtlantic. If it be admitted, then, that a mass of water flows across\r\nthe arctic circle from north to south, it must also be admitted that an\r\nequal mass flows across from south to north. It is also evident that\r\nthe water crossing from south to north must be warmer than the water\r\ncrossing from north to south; for the temperate regions are warmer than\r\nthe arctic, and the ocean in temperate regions warmer than the ocean in\r\nthe arctic; consequently the current which flows into the arctic seas,\r\nto compensate for the cold arctic current, must be a warmer current.\r\n\r\nIs the Gulf-stream this warm current? Does this compensating warm\r\ncurrent proceed from the Atlantic or from the Pacific? If it proceeds\r\nfrom the Atlantic, it is simply the warm water of the Gulf-stream.\r\nWe may call it the warm water of the Atlantic if we choose; but this\r\ncannot materially affect the question at issue, for the heat which\r\nthe waters of the Atlantic possess is derived, as we have seen, to\r\nan enormous extent from the water brought from the tropics by the\r\nGulf-stream. If we deny that the warm compensating current comes from\r\nthe Atlantic, then we must assume that it comes from the Pacific. But\r\nif the cold current flows from the arctic regions into the Atlantic,\r\nand the warm compensating current from the Pacific into the arctic\r\nregions, the highest temperature should be found on the Pacific side of\r\nthe arctic regions and not on the Atlantic side; the reverse, however,\r\nis the case. In the Atlantic, for example, the 41° isothermal line\r\nreaches to latitude 65°30′, while in the Pacific it nowhere goes beyond\r\nlatitude 57°. The 27° isotherm reaches to latitude 75° in the Atlantic,\r\nbut in the Pacific it does not pass beyond 64°. And the 14° isotherm\r\nreaches the north of Spitzbergen in latitude 80°, whereas on the\r\nPacific side of the arctic regions it does not reach to latitude 72°.\r\n\r\nOn no point of the earth’s surface does the mean annual temperature\r\nrise so high above the normal as in the northern Atlantic, just at\r\nthe arctic circle, at a spot believed to be in the middle of the\r\nGulf-stream. This place is no less than 22°·5 above the normal, while\r\nin the northern Pacific the temperature does not anywhere rise more\r\nthan 9° above the normal. These facts prove that the warm current\r\npasses up the Atlantic into the arctic regions and not up the Pacific,\r\nor at least that the larger amount of warm water must pass into the\r\narctic regions through the Atlantic. In other words, the Gulf-stream is\r\nthe warm compensating current. Not only must there be a warm stream,\r\nbut one of very considerable magnitude, in order to compensate for the\r\ngreat amount of cold water that is constantly flowing from the arctic\r\nregions, and also to maintain the temperature of those regions so much\r\nabove the temperature of space as they actually are.\r\n\r\nNo doubt, when the results of the late dredging expedition are\r\npublished, they will cast much additional light on the direction and\r\ncharacter of the currents forming the north-eastern branch of the\r\nGulf-stream.\r\n\r\nThe average quantity of heat received by the arctic regions as a whole\r\nper unit surface to that received at the equator, as we have already\r\nseen, is as 5·45 to 12, assuming that the percentage of rays cut off by\r\nthe atmosphere is the same at both places. In this case the mean annual\r\ntemperature of the arctic regions, taken as a whole, would be about\r\n−69°, did those regions depend entirely for their temperature upon the\r\nheat received directly from the sun. But the temperature would not even\r\nreach to this; for the percentage of rays cut off by the atmosphere in\r\narctic regions is generally believed to be greater than at the equator,\r\nand consequently the actual mean quantity of heat received by the\r\narctic regions will be less than 5·45−12ths of what is received at the\r\nequator.\r\n\r\nIn the article on Climate in the “Encyclopædia Britannica” there is\r\na Table calculated upon the principle that the quantity of heat cut\r\noff is proportionate to the number of aërial particles which the rays\r\nhave to encounter before reaching the surface of the earth—that, as\r\na general rule, if the tracts of the rays follow an arithmetical\r\nprogression, the diminished force with which the rays reach the ground\r\nwill form a decreasing geometrical progression. According to this Table\r\nabout 75 per cent. of the sun’s rays are cut off by the atmosphere\r\nin arctic regions. If 75 per cent. of the rays were cut off by the\r\natmosphere in arctic regions, then the direct rays of the sun could\r\nnot maintain a mean temperature 100° above that of space. But this is\r\nno doubt much too high a percentage for the quantity of heat cut off;\r\nfor recent discoveries in regard to the absorption of radiant heat by\r\ngases and vapours prove that Tables computed on this principle must be\r\nincorrect. The researches of Tyndall and Melloni show that when rays\r\npass through any substance, the absorption is rapid at first: but the\r\nrays are soon “sifted,” as it is called, and they then pass onwards\r\nwith but little further obstruction. Still, however, owing to the dense\r\nfogs which prevail in arctic regions, the quantity of heat cut off\r\nmust be considerable. If as much as 50 per cent. of the sun’s rays\r\nare cut off by the atmosphere in arctic regions, the amount of heat\r\nreceived directly from the sun would not be sufficient to maintain a\r\nmean annual temperature of −100°. Consequently the arctic regions must\r\ndepend to an enormous extent upon ocean-currents for their temperature.\r\n\r\n_Influence of Ocean-currents shown by another Method._—That the\r\ntemperature of the arctic regions would sink enormously, and the\r\ntemperature of the equator rise enormously, were all ocean-currents\r\nstopped, can be shown by another method—viz., by taking the mean annual\r\ntemperature from the equator to the pole along a meridian passing\r\nthrough the ocean, say, the Atlantic, and comparing it with the mean\r\nannual temperature taken along a meridian passing through a great\r\ncontinent, say, the Asiatic.\r\n\r\nProfessor J. D. Forbes, in an interesting memoir,[26] has endeavoured\r\nby this method to determine what would be the temperature of the\r\nequator and the poles were the globe all water or all land. He has\r\ntaken the temperature of the two meridians from the tables and charts\r\nof Professor Dove, and ascertained the exact proportion of land and\r\nwater on every 10° of latitude from the equator to the poles, with the\r\nview of determining what proportion of the average temperature of the\r\nglobe in each parallel is due to the land, and what to the water which\r\nrespectively belongs to it. He next endeavours to obtain a formula for\r\nexpressing the mean temperature of a given parallel, and thence arrives\r\nat “an approximate answer to the inquiry as to what would have been the\r\nequatorial or polar temperature of the globe, or that of any latitude,\r\nhad its surface been entirely composed of land or of water.”\r\n\r\nThe result at which he arrived is this: that, were the surface of\r\nthe globe all water, 71°·7 would be the temperature of the equator,\r\nand 12°·5 the temperature of the poles; and were the surface all\r\nland, 109°·8 would be the temperature of the equator, and −25°·6 the\r\ntemperature of the poles.\r\n\r\nBut in Professor Forbes’s calculations no account whatever is taken\r\nof the influence of currents, whether of water or of air, and the\r\ndifference of temperature is attributed wholly to difference of\r\nlatitude and the physical properties of land and water in relation to\r\ntheir powers in absorbing and detaining the sun’s rays, and to the laws\r\nof conduction and of convection which regulate the internal motion of\r\nheat in the one and in the other. He considers that the effects of\r\ncurrents are all compensatory.\r\n\r\n“If a current of hot water,” he says, “moderates the cold of a Lapland\r\nwinter, the counter-current, which brings the cold of Greenland to the\r\nshores of the United States, in a great measure restores the balance of\r\ntemperature, so far as it is disturbed by this particular influence.\r\nThe prevalent winds, in like manner, including the trade-winds, though\r\nthey render some portions of continents, on the average, hotter or\r\ncolder than others, produce just the contrary effect elsewhere. Each\r\ncontinent, if it has a cold eastern shore, has likewise a warm western\r\none; and even local winds have for the most part established laws of\r\ncompensation. In a given parallel of latitude all these secondary\r\ncauses of local climate may be imagined to be mutually compensatory,\r\nand the outstanding gradation of mean or normal temperature will\r\nmainly depend, 1st, upon the effect of latitude simply; 2nd, on\r\nthe distribution of land and water considered in their primary or\r\n_statical_ effect.”\r\n\r\nIt is singular that a physicist so acute as Professor Forbes should,\r\nin a question such as this, leave out of account the influence of\r\ncurrents, under the impression that their effects were compensatory.\r\n\r\nIf there is a constant transference of hot water from the equatorial\r\nregions to the polar, and of cold water from the polar regions to the\r\nequatorial (a thing which Professor Forbes admitted), then there can\r\nonly be one place between the equator and the pole where the two sets\r\nof currents compensate each other. At all places on the equatorial\r\nside of this point a cooling effect is the result. Starting from this\r\nneutral point, the preponderance of the cooling effect over the heating\r\nincreases as we approach towards the equator, and the preponderance of\r\nthe heating effect over the cooling increases as we recede from this\r\npoint towards the pole—the cooling effect reaching a maximum at the\r\nequator, and the heating effect a maximum at the pole.\r\n\r\nHad Professor Forbes observed this important fact, he would have\r\nseen at once that the low temperature of the land in high latitudes,\r\nin comparison with that of the sea, was no index whatever as to\r\nhow much the temperature of those regions would sink were the sea\r\nentirely removed and the surface to become land; for the present\r\nhigh temperature of the sea is not due wholly to the mere physical\r\nproperties of water, but to a great extent is due to the heat brought\r\nby currents from the equator. Now, unless it is known how much of\r\nthe absolute temperature of the ocean in those latitudes is due to\r\ncurrents, we cannot tell how much the removal of the sea would lower\r\nthe absolute temperature of those places. Were the sea removed,\r\nthe continents in high latitudes would not simply lose the heating\r\nadvantages which they presently derive from the mere fact of their\r\nproximity to so much sea, but the removal would, in addition to this,\r\ndeprive them of an enormous amount of heat which they at present\r\nreceive from the tropics by means of ocean-currents. And, on the other\r\nhand, at the equator, were the sea removed, the continents there\r\nwould not simply lose the cooling influences which result from their\r\nproximity to so much water, but, in addition to this, they would have\r\nto endure the scorching effects which would result from the heat which\r\nis at present carried away from the tropics by ocean-currents.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen that Professor Forbes concluded that the\r\nremoval of the sea would raise the mean temperature of the equator\r\n30°, and lower the temperature of the poles 28°; it is therefore\r\nperfectly certain that, had he added to his result the effect due to\r\nocean-currents, and had he been aware that about one-fifth of all the\r\nheat possessed by the Atlantic is actually derived from the equator by\r\nmeans of the Gulf-stream, he would have assigned a temperature to the\r\nequator and the poles, of a globe all land, differing not very far from\r\nwhat I have concluded would be the temperature of those places were all\r\nocean and aërial currents stopped, and each place to depend solely upon\r\nthe heat which it received directly from the sun.\r\n\r\n_Without Ocean-currents the Globe would not be habitable._—All these\r\nforegoing considerations show to what an extent the climatic condition\r\nof our globe is due to the thermal influences of ocean-currents.\r\n\r\nAs regards the northern hemisphere, we have two immense oceans, the\r\nPacific and the Atlantic, extending from the equator to near the north\r\npole, or perhaps to the pole altogether. Between these two oceans lie\r\ntwo great continents, the eastern and the western. Owing to the earth’s\r\nspherical form, far too much heat is received at the equator and far\r\ntoo little at high latitudes to make the earth a suitable habitation\r\nfor sentient beings. The function of these two great oceans is to\r\nremove the heat from the equator and carry it to temperate and polar\r\nregions. Aërial currents could not do this. They might remove the heat\r\nfrom the equator, but they could not, as we have already seen, carry\r\nit to the temperate and polar regions; for the greater portion of the\r\nheat which aërial currents remove from the equator is dissipated into\r\nstellar space: the ocean alone can convey the heat to distant shores.\r\nBut aërial currents have a most important function; for of what avail\r\nwould it be, though ocean-currents should carry heat to high latitudes,\r\nif there were no means of distributing the heat thus conveyed over the\r\nland? The function of aërial currents is to do this. Upon this twofold\r\narrangement depends the thermal condition of the globe. Exclude the\r\nwaters of the Pacific and the Atlantic from temperate and polar regions\r\nand place them at the equator, and nothing now existing on the globe\r\ncould live in high latitudes.\r\n\r\nWere these two great oceans placed beside each other on one side of the\r\nglobe, and the two great continents placed beside each other on the\r\nother side, the northern hemisphere would not then be suitable for the\r\npresent order of things: the land on the central and on the eastern\r\nside of the united continent would be far too cold.\r\n\r\n_The foregoing Conclusions not affected by the Imperfection of the\r\nData._—The general results at which we have arrived in reference to the\r\ninfluence of ocean-currents on the climatic condition of the globe are\r\nnot affected by the imperfection of the data employed. It is perfectly\r\ntrue that considerable uncertainty prevails regarding some of the data;\r\nbut, after making the fullest allowance for every possible error, the\r\ninfluence of currents is so enormous that the general conclusion cannot\r\nbe materially affected. I can hardly imagine that any one familiar\r\nwith the physics of the subject will be likely to think that, owing to\r\npossible errors in the data, the effects have probably been doubled.\r\nEven admitting, however, that this were proved to be the case, still\r\nthat would not materially alter the general conclusion at which we\r\nhave arrived. The influence of ocean-currents in the distribution of\r\nheat over the surface of the globe would still be admittedly enormous,\r\nwhether we concluded that owing to them the present temperature of the\r\nequator is 55° or 27° colder than it would otherwise be, or the poles\r\n83° or 41° hotter than they would be did no currents exist.\r\n\r\nNay, more, suppose we should again halve the result; even in that case\r\nwe should have to admit that, owing to ocean-currents, the equator\r\nis about 14° colder and the poles about 21° hotter than they would\r\notherwise be; in other words, we should have to admit that, were it not\r\nfor ocean-currents, the mean temperature of the equator would be about\r\n100° and the mean temperature of the poles about −21°.\r\n\r\nIf the influence of ocean-currents in reducing the difference between\r\nthe temperature of the equator and poles amounted to only a few\r\ndegrees, it would of course be needless to put much weight on any\r\nresults arrived at by the method of calculation which I have adopted;\r\nbut when it is a matter of two hundred degrees, it is not at all likely\r\nthat the general results will be very much affected by any errors which\r\nmay ever be found in the data.\r\n\r\nObjections of a palæontological nature have frequently been urged\r\nagainst the opinion that our island is much indebted for its mild\r\nclimate to the influence of the Gulf-stream; but, from what has already\r\nbeen stated, it must be apparent that all objections of that nature\r\nare of little avail. The palæontologist may detect, from the character\r\nof the flora and fauna brought up from the sea-bottom by dredging and\r\nother means, the presence of a warm or of a cold current; but this can\r\nnever enable him to prove that the temperate and polar regions are\r\nnot affected to an enormous extent by warm water conveyed from the\r\nequatorial regions. For anything that palæontology can show to the\r\ncontrary, were ocean-currents to cease, the mean annual temperature\r\nof our island might sink below the present midwinter temperature of\r\nSiberia. What would be the thermal condition of our globe were there no\r\nocean-currents is a question for the physicist; not for the naturalist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n    OUTLINE OF THE PHYSICAL AGENCIES WHICH LEAD TO SECULAR CHANGES\r\n                              OF CLIMATE.\r\n\r\n  Eccentricity of the Earth’s Orbit; its Effect on\r\n      Climate.—Glacial Epoch not the direct Result of an\r\n      Increase of Eccentricity.—An important Consideration\r\n      overlooked.—Change of Eccentricity affects Climate only\r\n      indirectly.—Agencies which are brought into Operation\r\n      by an Increase of Eccentricity.—How an Accumulation\r\n      of Snow is produced.—The Effect of Snow on the Summer\r\n      Temperature.—Reason of the low Summer Temperature of Polar\r\n      Regions.—Deflection of Ocean-currents the chief Cause of\r\n      secular Changes of Climate.—How the foregoing Causes deflect\r\n      Ocean-currents.—Nearness of the Sun in Perigee a Cause of\r\n      the Accumulation of Ice.—A remarkable Circumstance regarding\r\n      the Causes which lead to secular Changes of Climate.—The\r\n      primary Cause an Increase of Eccentricity.—Mean Temperature\r\n      of whole Earth should be greater in Aphelion than in\r\n      Perihelion.—Professor Tyndall on the Glacial Epoch.—A\r\n      general Reduction of Temperature will not produce a Glacial\r\n      Epoch.—Objection from the present Condition of the Planet\r\n      Mars.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Primary cause of Change of Eccentricity of the Earth’s Orbit._—There\r\nare two causes affecting the position of the earth in relation to\r\nthe sun, which must, to a very large extent, influence the earth’s\r\nclimate; viz., the precession of the equinoxes and the change in the\r\neccentricity of the earth’s orbit. If we duly examine the combined\r\ninfluence of these two causes, we shall find that the northern and\r\nsouthern portions of the globe are subject to an excessively slow\r\nsecular change of climate, consisting in a slow periodic change of\r\nalternate warmer and colder cycles.\r\n\r\nAccording to the calculations of Leverrier, the superior limit of the\r\nearth’s eccentricity is 0·07775.[27] The eccentricity is at present\r\ndiminishing, and will continue to do so during 23,980 years, from the\r\nyear 1800 A.D., when its value will be then ·00314.\r\n\r\nThe change in the eccentricity of the earth’s orbit may affect\r\nthe climate in two different ways; viz., by either increasing or\r\ndiminishing the mean annual amount of heat received from the sun, or\r\nby increasing or diminishing the difference between summer and winter\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\nLet us consider the former case first. The total quantity of heat\r\nreceived from the sun during one revolution is inversely proportional\r\nto the minor axis.\r\n\r\nThe difference of the minor axis of the orbit when at its maximum and\r\nits minimum state of eccentricity is as 997 to 1000. This small amount\r\nof difference cannot therefore sensibly affect the climate. Hence we\r\nmust seek for our cause in the second case under consideration.\r\n\r\nThere is of course as yet some little uncertainty in regard to the\r\nexact mean distance of the sun. I shall, however, in the present volume\r\nassume it to be 91,400,000 miles. When the eccentricity is at its\r\nsuperior limit, the distance of the sun from the earth, when the latter\r\nis in the aphelion of its orbit, is no less than 98,506,350 miles;\r\nand when in the perihelion it is only 84,293,650 miles. The earth is\r\ntherefore 14,212,700 miles further from the sun in the former position\r\nthan in the latter. The direct heat of the sun being inversely as the\r\nsquare of the distance, it follows that the amount of heat received\r\nby the earth when in these two positions will be as 19 to 26. Taking\r\nthe present eccentricity to be ·0168, the earth’s distance during\r\nwinter, when nearest to the sun, is 89,864,480 miles. Suppose now that,\r\naccording to the precession of the equinoxes, winter in our northern\r\nhemisphere should happen when the earth is in the aphelion of its\r\norbit, at the time when the orbit is at its greatest eccentricity; the\r\nearth would then be 8,641,870 miles further from the sun in winter than\r\nat present. The direct heat of the sun would therefore be one-fifth\r\nless during that season than at present; and in summer one-fifth\r\ngreater. This enormous difference would affect the climate to a very\r\ngreat extent. But if winter under these circumstances should happen\r\nwhen the earth is in the perihelion of its orbit, the earth would then\r\nbe 14,212,700 miles nearer the sun in winter than in summer. In this\r\ncase the difference between winter and summer in the latitude of this\r\ncountry would be almost annihilated. But as the winter in the one\r\nhemisphere corresponds with the summer in the other, it follows that\r\nwhile the one hemisphere would be enduring the greatest extremes of\r\nsummer heat and winter cold, the other would be enjoying a perpetual\r\nsummer.\r\n\r\nIt is quite true that whatever may be the eccentricity of the earth’s\r\norbit, the two hemispheres must receive equal quantities of heat per\r\nannum; for proximity to the sun is exactly compensated by the effect of\r\nswifter motion—the total amount of heat received from the sun between\r\nthe two equinoxes is the same in both halves of the year, whatever the\r\neccentricity of the earth’s orbit may be. For example, whatever extra\r\nheat the southern hemisphere may at present receive from the sun during\r\nits summer months owing to greater proximity to the sun, is exactly\r\ncompensated by a corresponding loss arising from the shortness of the\r\nseason; and, on the other hand, whatever deficiency of heat we in the\r\nnorthern hemisphere may at present have during our summer half year\r\nin consequence of the earth’s distance from the sun, is also exactly\r\ncompensated by a corresponding length of season.\r\n\r\nIt has been shown in the introductory chapter that a simple change in\r\nthe sun’s distance would not alone produce a glacial epoch, and that\r\nthose physicists who confined their attention to purely astronomical\r\neffects were perfectly correct in affirming that no increase of\r\neccentricity of the earth’s orbit could account for that epoch. But\r\nthe important fact was overlooked that although the glacial epoch\r\ncould not result directly from an increase of eccentricity, it might\r\nnevertheless do so indirectly. The glacial epoch, as I hope to show,\r\nwas not due directly to an increase in the eccentricity of the earth’s\r\norbit, but to a number of physical agents that were brought into\r\noperation as a result of an increase.\r\n\r\nI shall now proceed to give an outline of what these physical agents\r\nwere, how they were brought into operation, and the way in which they\r\nled to the glacial epoch.\r\n\r\nWhen the eccentricity is about its superior limit, the combined\r\neffect of all those causes to which I allude is to lower to a very\r\ngreat extent the temperature of the hemisphere whose winters occur in\r\naphelion, and to raise to nearly as great an extent the temperature of\r\nthe opposite hemisphere, where winter of course occurs in perihelion.\r\n\r\nWith the eccentricity at its superior limit and the winter occurring\r\nin the aphelion, the earth would be 8,641,870 miles further from the\r\nsun during that season than at present. The reduction in the amount\r\nof heat received from the sun owing to this increased distance would,\r\nupon the principle we have stated in Chapter II., lower the midwinter\r\ntemperature to an enormous extent. In temperate regions the greater\r\nportion of the moisture of the air is at present precipitated in the\r\nform of rain, and the very small portion which falls as snow disappears\r\nin the course of a few weeks at most. But in the circumstances under\r\nconsideration, the mean winter temperature would be lowered so much\r\nbelow the freezing-point that what now falls as rain during that season\r\nwould then fall as snow. This is not all; the winters would then not\r\nonly be colder than now, but they would also be much longer. At present\r\nthe winters are nearly eight days shorter than the summers; but with\r\nthe eccentricity at its superior limit and the winter solstice in\r\naphelion, the length of the winters would exceed that of the summers by\r\nno fewer than thirty-six days. The lowering of the temperature and the\r\nlengthening of the winter would both tend to the same effect, viz., to\r\nincrease the amount of snow accumulated during the winter; for, other\r\nthings being equal, the larger the snow-accumulating period the greater\r\nthe accumulation. I may remark, however, that the absolute quantity\r\nof heat received during winter is not affected by the decrease in the\r\nsun’s heat,[28] for the additional length of the season compensates\r\nfor this decrease. As regards the absolute amount of heat received,\r\nincrease of the sun’s distance and lengthening of the winter are\r\ncompensatory, but not so in regard to the amount of snow accumulated.\r\n\r\nThe consequence of this state of things would be that, at the\r\ncommencement of the short summer, the ground would be covered with the\r\nwinter’s accumulation of snow.\r\n\r\nAgain, the presence of so much snow would lower the summer temperature,\r\nand prevent to a great extent the melting of the snow.\r\n\r\nThere are three separate ways whereby accumulated masses of snow and\r\nice tend to lower the summer temperature, viz.:—\r\n\r\n_First._ By means of direct radiation. No matter what the intensity of\r\nthe sun’s rays may be, the temperature of snow and ice can never rise\r\nabove 32°. Hence the presence of snow and ice tends by direct radiation\r\nto lower the temperature of all surrounding bodies to 32°.\r\n\r\nIn Greenland, a country covered with snow and ice, the pitch has been\r\nseen to melt on the side of a ship exposed to the direct rays of the\r\nsun, while at the same time the surrounding air was far below the\r\nfreezing-point; a thermometer exposed to the direct radiation of the\r\nsun has been observed to stand above 100°, while the air surrounding\r\nthe instrument was actually 12° below the freezing-point.[29] A similar\r\nexperience has been recorded by travellers on the snow-fields of the\r\nAlps.[30]\r\n\r\nThese results, surprising as they no doubt appear, are what we ought\r\nto expect under the circumstances. The diathermancy of air has been\r\nwell established by the researches of Professor Tyndall on radiant\r\nheat. Perfectly dry air seems to be nearly incapable of absorbing\r\nradiant heat. The entire radiation passes through it almost without any\r\nsensible absorption. Consequently the pitch on the side of the ship may\r\nbe melted, or the bulb of the thermometer raised to a high temperature\r\nby the direct rays of the sun, while the surrounding air remains\r\nintensely cold. “A joint of meat,” says Professor Tyndall, “might be\r\nroasted before a fire, the air around the joint being cold as ice.”[31]\r\nThe air is cooled by _contact_ with the snow-covered ground, but is not\r\nheated by the radiation from the sun.\r\n\r\nWhen the air is humid and charged with aqueous vapour, a similar\r\ncooling effect also takes place, but in a slightly different way. Air\r\ncharged with aqueous vapour is a good absorber of radiant heat, but\r\nit can only absorb those rays which agree with it in _period_. It so\r\nhappens that rays from snow and ice are, of all others, those which it\r\nabsorbs best. The humid air will absorb the total radiation from the\r\nsnow and ice, but it will allow the greater part of, if not nearly all,\r\nthe sun’s rays to pass unabsorbed. But during the day, when the sun is\r\nshining, the radiation from the snow and ice to the air is negative;\r\nthat is, the snow and ice cool the air by radiation. The result is, the\r\nair is cooled by radiation from the snow and ice (or rather, we should\r\nsay, _to_ the snow and ice) more rapidly than it is heated by the sun;\r\nand, as a consequence, in a country like Greenland, covered with an\r\nicy mantle, the temperature of the air, even during summer, seldom\r\nrises above the freezing-point. Snow is a good reflector, but as simple\r\nreflection does not change the character of the rays they would not be\r\nabsorbed by the air, but would pass into stellar space.\r\n\r\nWere it not for the ice, the summers of North Greenland, owing to the\r\ncontinuance of the sun above the horizon, would be as warm as those of\r\nEngland; but, instead of this, the Greenland summers are colder than\r\nour winters. Cover India with an ice sheet, and its summers would be\r\ncolder than those of England.\r\n\r\n_Second._ Another cause of the cooling effect is that the rays which\r\nfall on snow and ice are to a great extent reflected back into\r\nspace.[32] But those that are not reflected, but absorbed, do not raise\r\nthe temperature, for they disappear in the mechanical work of melting\r\nthe ice. The latent heat of ice is about 142° F.; consequently in the\r\nmelting of every pound of ice a quantity of heat sufficient to raise\r\none pound of water 142° disappears, and is completely lost, so far\r\nas temperature is concerned. This quantity of heat is consumed, not\r\nin raising the temperature of the ice, but in the mechanical work of\r\ntearing the molecules separate against the forces of cohesion binding\r\nthem together into the solid form. No matter what the intensity of the\r\nsun’s heat may be, the surface of the ground will remain permanently at\r\n32° so long as the snow and ice continue unmelted. [**P1:missing page\r\nnumber]\r\n\r\n_Third._ Snow and ice lower the temperature by chilling the air and\r\ncondensing the vapour into thick fogs. The great strength of the sun’s\r\nrays during summer, due to his nearness at that season, would, in the\r\nfirst place, tend to produce an increased amount of evaporation. But\r\nthe presence of snow-clad mountains and an icy sea would chill the\r\natmosphere and condense the vapour into thick fogs. The thick fogs\r\nand cloudy sky would effectually prevent the sun’s rays from reaching\r\nthe earth, and the snow, in consequence, would remain unmelted during\r\nthe entire summer. In fact, we have this very condition of things\r\nexemplified in some of the islands of the Southern Ocean at the present\r\nday. Sandwich Land, which is in the same parallel of latitude as the\r\nnorth of Scotland, is covered with ice and snow the entire summer;\r\nand in the island of South Georgia, which is in the same parallel\r\nas the centre of England, the perpetual snow descends to the very\r\nsea-beach. The following is Captain Cook’s description of this dismal\r\nplace:—“We thought it very extraordinary,” he says, “that an island\r\nbetween the latitudes of 54° and 55° should, in the very height of\r\nsummer, be almost wholly covered with frozen snow, in some places many\r\nfathoms deep.... The head of the bay was terminated by ice-cliffs of\r\nconsiderable height; pieces of which were continually breaking off,\r\nwhich made a noise like a cannon. Nor were the interior parts of the\r\ncountry less horrible. The savage rocks raised their lofty summits till\r\nlost in the clouds, and valleys were covered with seemingly perpetual\r\nsnow. Not a tree nor a shrub of any size were to be seen. The only\r\nsigns of vegetation were a strong-bladed grass growing in tufts, wild\r\nburnet, and a plant-like moss seen on the rocks.... We are inclined to\r\nthink that the interior parts, on account of their elevation, never\r\nenjoy heat enough to melt the snow in such quantities as to produce\r\na river, nor did we find even a stream of fresh water on the whole\r\ncoast.”[33]\r\n\r\nCaptain Sir James Ross found the perpetual snow at the sea-level at\r\nAdmiralty Inlet, South Shetland, in lat. 64°; and while near this\r\nplace the thermometer in the very middle of summer fell at night to\r\n23° F.; and so rapidly was the young ice forming around the ship that\r\nhe began, he says, “to have serious apprehensions of the ships being\r\nfrozen in.”[34] At the comparatively low latitude of 59° S., in long.\r\n171° E. (the corresponding latitude of our Orkney Islands), snow was\r\nfalling on the longest day, and the surface of the sea at 32°.[35] And\r\nduring the month of February (the month corresponding to August in our\r\nhemisphere) there were only three days in which they were not assailed\r\nby snow-showers.[36]\r\n\r\nIn the Straits of Magellan, in 53° S. lat., where the direct heat of\r\nthe sun ought to be as great as in the centre of England, MM. Churrca\r\nand Galcano have seen snow fall in the middle of summer; and though the\r\nday was eighteen hours long, the thermometer seldom rose above 42° or\r\n44°, and never above 51°.[37]\r\n\r\nThis rigorous condition of climate chiefly results from the rays\r\nof the sun being intercepted by the dense fogs which envelope those\r\nregions during the entire summer; and the fogs again are due to the\r\nair being chilled by the presence of the snow-clad mountains and the\r\nimmense masses of floating ice which come from the antarctic seas. The\r\nreduction of the sun’s heat and lengthening of the winter, which would\r\ntake place when the eccentricity is near to its superior limit and the\r\nwinter in aphelion, would in this country produce a state of things\r\nperhaps as bad as, if not worse than, that which at present exists in\r\nSouth Georgia and South Shetland.\r\n\r\nIf we turn our attention to the polar regions, we shall find that\r\nthe cooling effects of snow and ice are even still more marked. The\r\ncoldness of the summers in polar regions is owing almost solely to this\r\ncause. Captain Scoresby states that, in regard to the arctic regions,\r\nthe general obscurity of the atmosphere arising from fogs or clouds is\r\nsuch that the sun is frequently invisible during several successive\r\ndays. At such times, when the sun is near the northern tropic, there is\r\nscarcely any sensible quantity of light from noon till midnight.[38]\r\n“And snow,” he says, “is so common in the arctic regions, that it may\r\nbe boldly stated that in nine days out of ten during the months of\r\nApril, May, and June more or less falls.”[39]\r\n\r\nOn the north side of Hudson’s Bay, for example, where the quantity of\r\nfloating ice during summer is enormous, and dense fogs prevail, the\r\nmean temperature of June does not rise above the freezing-point, being\r\nactually 13°·5 below the normal temperature; while in some parts of\r\nAsia under the same latitude, where there is comparatively little ice,\r\nthe mean temperature of June is as high as 60°.\r\n\r\nThe mean temperature of Van Rensselaer Harbour, in lat. 78° 37′ N.,\r\nlong. 70° 53′ W., was accurately determined from hourly observations\r\nmade day and night over a period of two years by Dr. Kane. It was found\r\nto be as follows:—\r\n\r\n               °\r\n  Winter     −28·59\r\n  Spring     −10·59\r\n  Summer     +33·38\r\n  Autumn     - 4·03\r\n\r\nBut although the quantity of heat received from the sun at that\r\nlatitude ought to have been greater during the summer than in\r\nEngland,[40] yet nevertheless the temperature is only 1°·38 above the\r\nfreezing-point.\r\n\r\nThe temperature of Port Bowen, lat. 73° 14′ N., was found to be as\r\nfollows:—\r\n\r\n               °\r\n  Winter     −25·09\r\n  Spring     - 5·77\r\n  Summer     +34·40\r\n  Autumn     +10·58\r\n\r\nHere the summer is only 2°·4 above the freezing-point.\r\n\r\nThe condition of things in the antarctic regions is even still worse\r\nthan in the arctic. Captain Sir James Ross, when between lat. 66° S.\r\nand 77° 5′ S., during the months of January and February, 1841, found\r\nthe mean temperature to be only 26°·5; and there were only two days\r\nwhen it rose even to the freezing-point. When near the ice-barrier on\r\nthe 8th of February, 1841, a season of the year equivalent to August\r\nin England, he had the thermometer at 12° at noon; and so rapidly was\r\nthe young ice forming around the ships, that it was with difficulty\r\nthat he escaped being frozen in for the winter. “Three days later,”\r\nhe says, “the thick falling snow prevented our seeing to any distance\r\nbefore us; the waves as they broke over the ships froze as they fell\r\non the decks and rigging, and covered our clothes with a thick coating\r\nof ice.”[41] On visiting the barrier next year about the same season,\r\nhe again ran the risk of being frozen in. He states that the surface\r\nof the sea presented one unbroken sheet of young ice as far as the eye\r\ncould discover from the masthead.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Wilkes, of the American Exploring Expedition, says that the\r\ntemperature they experienced in the antarctic regions surprised him,\r\nfor they seldom, if ever, had it above 30°, even at midday. Captain\r\nNares, when in latitude 64°S., between the 13th and 25th February last\r\n(1874), found the mean temperature of the air to be 31°·5; a lower\r\ntemperature than is met with in the arctic regions, in August, ten\r\ndegrees nearer the pole.[42]\r\n\r\nThese extraordinarily low temperatures during summer, which we have\r\njust been detailing, were due solely to the presence of snow and ice.\r\nIn South Georgia, Sandwich Land, and some other places which we have\r\nnoticed, the summers ought to be about as warm as those of England; yet\r\nto such an extent is the air cooled by means of floating ice coming\r\nfrom the antarctic regions, and the rays of the sun enfeebled by the\r\ndense fogs which prevail, that there is actually not heat sufficient\r\neven in the very middle of summer to melt the snow lying on the\r\nsea-beach.\r\n\r\nWe read with astonishment that a country in the latitude of England\r\nshould in the very middle of summer be covered with snow down to the\r\nsea-shore—the thermometer seldom rising much above the freezing-point.\r\nBut we do not consider it so surprising that the summer temperature of\r\nthe polar regions should be low, for we are accustomed to regard a low\r\ntemperature as the normal condition of things there. We are, however,\r\nmistaken if we suppose that the influence of ice on climate is less\r\nmarked at the poles than at such places as South Georgia or Sandwich\r\nLand.\r\n\r\nIt is true that a low summer temperature is the normal state of\r\nmatters in very high latitudes, but it is so only in consequence of\r\nthe perpetual presence of snow and ice. When we speak of the normal\r\ntemperature of a place we mean, of course, as we have already seen,\r\nthe normal temperature under the present condition of things. But\r\nwere the ice removed from those regions, our present Tables of normal\r\nsummer temperature would be valueless. These Tables give us the normal\r\nJune temperature while the ice remains, but they do not afford us the\r\nleast idea as to what that temperature would be were the ice removed.\r\nThe mere removal of the ice, all things else remaining the same, would\r\nraise the summer temperature enormously. The actual June temperature of\r\nMelville Island, for example, is 37°, and Port Franklin, Nova Zembla,\r\n36°·5; but were the ice removed from the arctic regions, we should\r\nthen find that the summer temperature of those places would be about\r\nas high as that of England. This will be evident from the following\r\nconsiderations:—\r\n\r\nThe temperature of a place, other things being equal, is proportionate\r\nto the quantity of heat received from the sun. If Greenland receives\r\nper given surface as much heat from the sun as England, its temperature\r\nought to be as high as that of England. Now, from May 10 till August\r\n3, a period of eighty-five days, the quantity of heat received from\r\nthe sun in consequence of his remaining above the horizon is actually\r\ngreater at the north pole than at the equator.\r\n\r\nColumn II. of the following Table, calculated by Mr. Meech,[43]\r\nrepresents the quantity of heat received from the sun on the 15th of\r\nJune at every 10° of latitude. To simplify the Table, I have taken 100\r\nas the unit quantity received at the equator on that day instead of the\r\nunit adopted by Mr. Meech:—\r\n\r\n  +-----------+---------+-----------+-------------+\r\n  |           |  I.     |    II.    |     III.    |\r\n  |           |         |           |             |\r\n  |           |Latitude.|  Quantity |     June    |\r\n  |           |         |  of heat. | temperature.|\r\n  +-----------+---------+-----------+-------------+\r\n  |           |     °   |           |      °      |\r\n  |Equator    |     0   |    100    |    80·0     |\r\n  |           |    10   |    111    |    81·1     |\r\n  |           |    20   |    118    |    81·1     |\r\n  |           |    30   |    123    |    77·3     |\r\n  |           |    40   |    125    |    68·0     |\r\n  |           |    50   |    125    |    58·8     |\r\n  |           |    60   |    123    |    51·4     |\r\n  |           |    70   |    127    |    39·2     |\r\n  |           |    80   |    133    |    30·2     |\r\n  |North Pole |    90   |    136    |    27·4     |\r\n  +-----------+---------+-----------+-------------+\r\n\r\n\r\nThe calculations are, of course, made upon the supposition that the\r\nquantity of rays cut off in passing through the atmosphere is the\r\nsame at the poles as at the equator, which, as we know, is not exactly\r\nthe case. But, notwithstanding the extra loss of solar heat in high\r\nlatitudes caused by the greater amount of rays that are cut off, still,\r\nif the temperature of the arctic summers were at all proportionate to\r\nthe quantity of heat received from the sun, it ought to be very much\r\nhigher than it actually is. Column III. represents the actual mean June\r\ntemperature, according to Prof. Dove, at the corresponding latitudes.\r\nA comparison of these two columns will show the very great deficiency\r\nof temperature in high latitudes during summer. At the equator, for\r\nexample, the quantity of heat received is represented by 100 and the\r\ntemperature 80°; while at the pole the temperature is only 27°·4,\r\nalthough the amount of heat received is 136. This low temperature\r\nduring summer, from what has been already shown, is due chiefly to the\r\npresence of snow and ice. If by some means or other we could remove\r\nthe snow and ice from the arctic regions, they would then enjoy a\r\ntemperate, if not a hot, summer. In Greenland, as we have already seen,\r\nsnow falls even in the very middle of summer, more or less, nine days\r\nout of ten; but remove the snow from the northern hemisphere, and a\r\nsnow-shower in Greenland during summer would be as great a rarity as it\r\nwould be on the plains of India.\r\n\r\nOther things being equal, the quantity of solar heat received in\r\nGreenland during summer is considerably greater than in England.\r\nConsequently, were it not for snow and ice, it would enjoy as warm a\r\nclimate during summer as that of England. Conversely, let the polar\r\nsnow and ice extend to the latitude of England, and the summers of that\r\ncountry would be as cold as those of Greenland. Our summers would then\r\nbe as cold as our winters are at present, and snow in the very middle\r\nof summer would perhaps be as common as rain.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Murphy’s Theory._—In a paper read before the Geological Society\r\nby Mr. Murphy[44] he admits that the glacial climate was due to an\r\nincrease of eccentricity, but maintains in opposition to me that the\r\nglaciated hemisphere must be that in which the _summer_ occurs in\r\n_aphelion_ during the greatest eccentricity of the earth’s orbit.\r\n\r\nI fear that Mr. Murphy must be resting his theory on the mistaken idea\r\nthat a summer in aphelion ought to melt less snow and ice than one in\r\nperihelion. It is quite true that the longer summer in aphelion—other\r\nthings being equal—is colder than the shorter one in perihelion, but\r\nthe quantity of heat received from the sun is the same in both cases.\r\nConsequently the quantity of snow and ice melted ought also to be the\r\nsame; for the amount melted is in proportion to the quantity of energy\r\nin the form of heat received.\r\n\r\nIt is true that with us at present less snow and ice are melted during\r\na cold summer than during a warm one. But this is not a case in point,\r\nfor during a cold summer we have less heat than during a warm summer,\r\nthe length of both being the same. The coldness of the summers in\r\nthis case is owing chiefly to a portion of the heat which we ought to\r\nreceive from the sun being cut off by some obstructing cause.\r\n\r\nThe reason why we have so little snow, and consequently so little ice,\r\nin temperate regions, is not, as Mr. Murphy seems to suppose, that\r\nthe heat of summer melts it all, but that there is so little to melt.\r\nAnd the reason why we have so little to melt is that, owing to the\r\nwarmth of our winters, we have generally rain instead of snow. But\r\nif you increase the eccentricity very much, and place the winter in\r\nperihelion, we should probably have no snow whatever, and, as far as\r\nglaciation is concerned, it would then matter very little what sort of\r\nsummer we had.\r\n\r\nBut it is not correct to say that the perihelion summer of the glacial\r\nepoch must have been hot. There are physical reasons, as we have just\r\nseen, which go to prove that, notwithstanding the nearness of the sun\r\nat that season, the temperature would seldom, if ever, rise much above\r\nthe freezing-point.\r\n\r\nBesides, Mr. Murphy overlooks the fact that the nearness of the sun\r\nduring summer was nearly as essential to the production of the ice, as\r\nwe shall shortly see, as his great distance during winter.\r\n\r\nWe must now proceed to the consideration of an agency which is brought\r\ninto operation by the foregoing condition of things, an agency far\r\nmore potent than any which has yet come under our notice, viz., the\r\n_Deflection of Ocean-currents_.\r\n\r\n_Deflection of Ocean-currents the chief Cause of secular Changes\r\nof Climate._—The enormous extent to which the thermal condition of\r\nthe globe is affected by ocean-currents seems to cast new light on\r\nthe mystery of geological climate. What, for example, would be the\r\ncondition of Europe were the Gulf-stream stopped, and the Atlantic thus\r\ndeprived of one-fifth of the absolute amount of heat which it is now\r\nreceiving above what it has in virtue of the temperature of space? If\r\nthe results just arrived at be at all justifiable, it follows that the\r\nstoppage of the stream would lower the temperature of northern Europe\r\nto an extent that would induce a condition of climate as severe as that\r\nof North Greenland; and were the warm currents of the North Pacific\r\nalso at the same time to be stopped, the northern hemisphere would\r\nassuredly be subjected to a state of general glaciation.\r\n\r\nSuppose also that the warm currents, having been withdrawn from the\r\nnorthern hemisphere, should flow into the Southern Ocean: what then\r\nwould be the condition of the southern hemisphere? Such a transference\r\nof heat would raise the temperature of the latter hemisphere about\r\nas much as it would lower the temperature of the former. It would\r\nconsequently raise the mean temperature of the antarctic regions much\r\nabove the freezing-point, and the ice under which those regions are\r\nat present buried would, to a great extent at least, disappear. The\r\nnorthern hemisphere, thus deprived of the heat from the equator, would\r\nbe under a condition of things similar to that which prevailed during\r\nthe glacial epoch; while the other hemisphere, receiving the heat from\r\nthe equator, would be under a condition of climate similar to what we\r\nknow prevailed in the northern hemisphere during a part of the Upper\r\nMiocene period, when North Greenland enjoyed a climate as mild as that\r\nof England at the present day.\r\n\r\nThis is no mere picture of the imagination, no mere hypothesis devised\r\nto meet a difficult case; for if what has already been stated be not\r\ncompletely erroneous, all this follows as a necessary consequence from\r\nphysical principles. If the warm currents of the equatorial regions\r\nbe all deflected into one hemisphere, such must be the condition of\r\nthings. How then do the agencies which we have been considering deflect\r\nocean-currents?\r\n\r\n_How the foregoing Causes deflect Ocean-currents._—A high condition\r\nof eccentricity tends, we have seen, to produce an accumulation of\r\nsnow and ice on the hemisphere whose winters occur in aphelion. This\r\naccumulation tends in turn to lower the summer temperature, to cut\r\noff the sun’s rays, and so to retard the melting of the snow. In\r\nshort, it tends to produce on that hemisphere a state of glaciation.\r\nExactly opposite effects take place on the other hemisphere, which\r\nhas its winter in perihelion. There the shortness of the winters and\r\nthe highness of the temperature, owing to the sun’s nearness, combine\r\nto prevent the accumulation of snow. The general result is that the\r\none hemisphere is cooled and the other heated. This state of things\r\nnow brings into play the agencies which lead to the deflection of the\r\nGulf-stream and other great ocean-currents.\r\n\r\nOwing to the great difference between the temperature of the equator\r\nand the poles, there is a constant flow of air from the poles to the\r\nequator. It is to this that the trade-winds owe their existence. Now as\r\nthe strength of these winds, as a general rule, will depend upon the\r\ndifference of temperature that may exist between the equator and higher\r\nlatitudes, it follows that the trades on the cold hemisphere will be\r\nstronger than those on the warm. When the polar and temperate regions\r\nof the one hemisphere are covered to a large extent with snow and ice,\r\nthe air, as we have just seen, is kept almost at the freezing-point\r\nduring both summer and winter. The trades on that hemisphere will, of\r\nnecessity, be exceedingly powerful; while on the other hemisphere,\r\nwhere there is comparatively little snow and ice, and the air is warm,\r\nthe trades will, as a consequence, be weak. Suppose now the northern\r\nhemisphere to be the cold one. The north-east trade-winds of this\r\nhemisphere will far exceed in strength the south-east trade-winds of\r\nthe southern hemisphere. The _median-line_ between the trades will\r\nconsequently lie to a very considerable distance to the south of\r\nthe equator. We have a good example of this at the present day. The\r\ndifference of temperature between the two hemispheres at present is\r\nbut trifling to what it would be in the case under consideration; yet\r\nwe find that the south-east trades of the Atlantic blow with greater\r\nforce than the north-east trades, and the result is that the south-east\r\ntrades sometimes extend to 10° or 15° N. lat., whereas the north-east\r\ntrades seldom blow south of the equator. The effect of the northern\r\ntrades blowing across the equator to a great distance will be to impel\r\nthe warm water of the tropics over into the Southern Ocean. But this\r\nis not all; not only would the median-line of the trades be shifted\r\nsouthwards, but the great equatorial currents of the globe would also\r\nbe shifted southwards.\r\n\r\nLet us now consider how this would affect the Gulf-stream. The South\r\nAmerican continent is shaped somewhat in the form of a triangle, with\r\none of its angular corners, called Cape St. Roque, pointing eastwards.\r\nThe equatorial current of the Atlantic impinges against this corner;\r\nbut as the greater portion of the current lies a little to the north\r\nof the corner, it flows westward into the Gulf of Mexico and forms the\r\nGulf-stream. A considerable portion of the water, however, strikes the\r\nland to the south of the Cape and is deflected along the shores of\r\nBrazil into the Southern Ocean, forming what is known as the Brazilian\r\ncurrent.\r\n\r\nNow it is perfectly obvious that the shifting of the equatorial\r\ncurrent of the Atlantic only a few degrees to the south of its present\r\nposition—a thing which would certainly take place under the conditions\r\nwhich we have been detailing—would turn the entire current into the\r\nBrazilian branch, and instead of flowing chiefly into the Gulf of\r\nMexico as at present, it would all flow into the Southern Ocean, and\r\nthe Gulf-stream would consequently be stopped. The stoppage of the\r\nGulf-stream, combined with all those causes which we have just been\r\nconsidering, would place Europe under glacial conditions; while, at the\r\nsame time, the temperature of the Southern Ocean would, in consequence\r\nof the enormous quantity of warm water received, have its temperature\r\n(already high from other causes) raised enormously.\r\n\r\n_Deflection of the Gulf-stream during the Glacial Epoch indicated by\r\nthe Difference between the Clyde and Canadian Shell-beds._—That the\r\nglaciation of north-western Europe resulted to a great extent from\r\nthe stoppage of the Gulf-stream may, I think, be inferred from a\r\ncircumstance pointed out by the Rev. Mr. Crosskey, several years ago,\r\nin a paper read before the Glasgow Geological Society.[45] He showed\r\nthat the difference between the glacial shells of Canada and those\r\nnow existing in the Gulf of St. Lawrence is much less marked than the\r\ndifference between the glacial shells of the Clyde beds and those now\r\nexisting in the Firth. And from this he justly infers that the change\r\nof climate in Canada since the glacial epoch has been far less complete\r\nthan in Scotland.\r\n\r\nThe return of the Gulf-stream has raised the mean annual temperature of\r\nour island no less than 15° above the normal, while Canada, deprived of\r\nits influence and exposed to a cold stream from polar regions, has been\r\nkept nearly as much below the normal.\r\n\r\nLet us compare the present temperature of the two countries. In making\r\nour comparison we must, of course, compare places on the same latitude.\r\nIt will not do, for example, to compare Glasgow with Montreal or\r\nQuebec, places on the latitude of the south of France and north of\r\nItaly. It will be found that the difference of temperature between\r\nthe two countries is so enormous as to appear scarcely credible to\r\nthose who have not examined the matter. The temperatures have all been\r\ntaken from Professor Dove’s work on the “Distribution of Heat over the\r\nSurface of the Globe,” and his Tables published in the Report of the\r\nBritish Association for 1847.\r\n\r\nThe mean temperature of Scotland for January is about 38° F., while\r\nin some parts of Labrador, on the same latitude, and all along the\r\ncentral parts of North America lying to the north of Upper Canada,\r\nit is actually 10°, and in many places 13° below zero. The January\r\ntemperature at the Cumberland House, which is situated on the latitude\r\nof the centre of England, is more than 13° below zero. Here is a\r\ndifference of no less than 51°. The normal temperature for the month\r\nof January in the latitude of Glasgow, according to Professor Dove, is\r\n10°. Consequently, owing to the influence of the Gulf-stream, we are\r\n28° warmer during that month than we would otherwise be, while vast\r\ntracts of country in America are 23° colder than they should be.\r\n\r\nThe July temperature of Glasgow is 61°, while on the same latitude\r\nin Labrador and places to the west it is only 49°. Glasgow during\r\nthat month is 3° above the normal temperature, while America, owing\r\nto the influence of the cold polar stream, is 9° below it. The mean\r\nannual temperature of Glasgow is nearly 50°, while in America, on the\r\nsame latitude, it is only 30°, and in many places as low as 23°. The\r\nmean normal temperature for the whole year is 35°. Our mean annual\r\ntemperature is therefore 15° above the normal, and that of America from\r\n5° to 12° below it. The American winters are excessively cold, owing\r\nto the continental character of the climate, and the absence of any\r\nbenefit from the Gulf-stream, while the summers, which would otherwise\r\nbe warm, are, in the latitude of Glasgow, cooled down to a great extent\r\nby the cold ice from Greenland; and the consequence is, that the mean\r\nannual temperature is about 20° or 27° below that of ours. The mean\r\nannual temperature of the Gulf of St. Lawrence is as low as that of\r\nLapland or Iceland. It is no wonder, then, that the shells which\r\nflourished in Canada during the glacial epoch have not left the gulf\r\nand the neighbouring seas.\r\n\r\nWe have good reason to believe that the climate of America during the\r\nglacial epoch was even then somewhat more severe than that of Western\r\nEurope, for the erratics of America extend as far south as latitude\r\n40°, while on the old continent they are not found much beyond latitude\r\n50°. This difference may have resulted from the fact that the western\r\nside of a continent is always warmer than the eastern.\r\n\r\nIn order to determine whether the cold was as great in America during\r\nthe glacial epoch as in Western Europe, we must not compare the fossils\r\nfound in the glacial beds about Montreal, for example, with those found\r\nin the Clyde beds, for Montreal lies much further to the south than the\r\nClyde. The Clyde beds must be compared with those of Labrador, while\r\nthe beds of Montreal must be compared with those of the south of France\r\nand the north of Italy, if any are to be found there.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, it may be concluded that had the Gulf-stream not returned\r\nto our shores at the close of the glacial epoch, and had its place\r\nbeen supplied by a cold stream from the polar regions, similar to that\r\nwhich washes the shores of North America, it is highly probable that\r\nnearly every species found in our glacial beds would have had their\r\nrepresentatives flourishing in the British seas at the present day.\r\n\r\nIt is no doubt true that when we compare the places in which the\r\nCanadian shell-beds referred to by Mr. Crosskey are situated with\r\nplaces on the same latitude in Europe, the difference of climate\r\nresulting from the influence of the Gulf-stream is not so great as\r\nbetween Scotland and those places which we have been considering; but\r\nstill the difference is sufficiently great to account for why the\r\nchange of climate in Canada has been less complete than in Scotland.\r\n\r\nAnd what holds true in regard to the currents of the Atlantic holds\r\nalso true, though perhaps not to the same extent, of the currents of\r\nthe Pacific.\r\n\r\n_Nearness of the Sun in Perigee a Cause of the Accumulation of\r\nIce._—But there is still another cause which must be noticed:—A strong\r\nunder current of air _from_ the north implies an equally strong upper\r\ncurrent _to_ the north. Now if the effect of the under current would\r\nbe to impel the warm water at the equator to the south, the effect\r\nof the upper current would be to carry the aqueous vapour formed at\r\nthe equator to the north; the upper current, on reaching the snow and\r\nice of temperate regions, would deposit its moisture in the form of\r\nsnow; so that, notwithstanding the great cold of the glacial epoch,\r\nit is probable that the quantity of snow falling in the northern\r\nregions would be enormous. This would be particularly the case during\r\nsummer, when the earth would be in the perihelion and the heat at the\r\nequator great. The equator would be the furnace where evaporation would\r\ntake place, and the snow and ice of temperate regions would act as a\r\ncondenser.\r\n\r\nHeat to produce _evaporation_ is just as essential to the accumulation\r\nof snow and ice as cold to produce _condensation_. Now at Midsummer,\r\non the supposition of the eccentricity being at its superior limit,\r\nthe sun would be 8,641,870 miles nearer than at present during that\r\nseason. The effect would be that the intensity of the sun’s rays would\r\nbe one-fifth greater than now. That is to say, for every five rays\r\nreceived by the ocean at present, six rays would be received then,\r\nconsequently the evaporation during summer would be excessive. But the\r\nice-covered land would condense the vapour into snow. It would, no\r\ndoubt, be during summer that the greatest snowfall would take place. In\r\nfact, the nearness of the sun during that season was as essential to\r\nthe production of the glacial epoch as was his distance during winter.\r\n\r\nThe direct effect of eccentricity is to produce on one of the\r\nhemispheres a long and cold winter. This alone would not lead to a\r\ncondition of things so severe as that which we know prevailed during\r\nthe glacial epoch. But the snow and ice thus produced would bring into\r\noperation, as we have seen, a host of physical agencies whose combined\r\nefforts would be quite sufficient to do this.\r\n\r\n_A remarkable Circumstance regarding those Causes which lead to Secular\r\nChanges of Climate._—There is one remarkable circumstance connected\r\nwith those physical causes which deserves special notice. They not only\r\nall lead to one result, viz., an accumulation of snow and ice, but\r\nthey react on one another. It is quite a common thing in physics for\r\nthe effect to react on the cause. In electricity and magnetism, for\r\nexample, cause and effect in almost every case mutually act and react\r\nupon each other. But it is usually, if not universally, the case that\r\nthe reaction of the effect tends to weaken the cause. The weakening\r\ninfluences of this reaction tend to impose a limit on the efficiency\r\nof the cause. But, strange to say, in regard to the physical causes\r\nconcerned in the bringing about of the glacial condition of climate,\r\ncause and effect mutually reacted so as to strengthen each other. And\r\nthis circumstance had a great deal to do with the extraordinary results\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the accumulation of snow and ice on the ground\r\nresulting from the long and cold winters tended to cool the air\r\nand produce fogs which cut off the sun’s rays. The rays thus cut\r\noff diminished the melting power of the sun, and so increased the\r\naccumulation. As the snow and ice continued to accumulate, more and\r\nmore of the rays were cut off; and on the other hand, as the rays\r\ncontinued to be cut off, the _rate_ of accumulation increased, because\r\nthe quantity of snow and ice melted became thus annually less and less.\r\n\r\nAgain, during the long and dreary winters of the glacial epoch the\r\nearth would be radiating off its heat into space. Had the heat thus\r\nlost simply gone to lower the temperature, the lowering of the\r\ntemperature would have tended to diminish the rate of loss; but the\r\nnecessary result of this was the formation of snow and ice rather than\r\nthe lowering of temperature.\r\n\r\nAnd, again, the formation of snow and ice facilitated the rate at which\r\nthe earth lost its heat; and on the other hand, the more rapidly the\r\nearth parted with its heat, the more rapidly were the snow and ice\r\nformed.\r\n\r\nFurther, as the snow and ice accumulated on the one hemisphere, they\r\nat the same time continued to diminish on the other. This tended to\r\nincrease the strength of the trade-winds on the cold hemisphere, and\r\nto weaken those on the warm. The effect of this on ocean currents\r\nwould be to impel the warm water of the tropics more to the warm\r\nhemisphere than to the cold. Suppose the northern hemisphere to be\r\nthe cold one, then as the snow and ice began gradually to accumulate\r\nthere, the ocean currents of that hemisphere would begin to decrease in\r\nvolume, while those on the southern, or warm, hemisphere, would _pari\r\npassu_ increase. This withdrawal of heat from the northern hemisphere\r\nwould tend, of course, to lower the temperature of that hemisphere\r\nand thus favour the accumulation of snow and ice. As the snow and ice\r\naccumulated the ocean currents would decrease, and, on the other hand,\r\nas the ocean currents diminished the snow and ice would accumulate,—the\r\ntwo effects mutually strengthening each other.\r\n\r\nThe same must have held true in regard to aërial currents. The more\r\nthe polar and temperate regions became covered with snow and ice, the\r\nstronger would become the trades and anti-trades of the hemisphere; and\r\nthe stronger those winds became, the greater would be the amount of\r\nmoisture transferred from the tropical regions by the anti-trades to\r\nthe temperate regions; and on the other hand, the more moisture those\r\nwinds brought to temperate regions, the greater would be the quantity\r\nof snow produced.\r\n\r\nThe same process of mutual action and reaction would take place among\r\nthe agencies in operation on the warm hemisphere, only the result\r\nproduced would be diametrically opposite of that produced in the cold\r\nhemisphere. On this warm hemisphere action and reaction would tend to\r\nraise the mean temperature and diminish the quantity of snow and ice\r\nexisting in temperate and polar regions.\r\n\r\nHad it been possible for each of those various physical agents which we\r\nhave been considering to produce its direct effects without influencing\r\nthe other agents or being influenced by them, its real efficiency in\r\nbringing about either the glacial condition of climate or the warm\r\ncondition of climate would not have been so great.\r\n\r\nThe primary cause that set all those various physical agencies in\r\noperation which brought about the glacial epoch, was a high state of\r\neccentricity of the earth’s orbit. When the eccentricity is at a\r\nhigh value, snow and ice begin to accumulate, owing to the increasing\r\nlength and coldness of the winter on that hemisphere whose winter\r\nsolstice is approaching toward the aphelion. The accumulating snow\r\nthen begins to bring into operation all the various agencies which\r\nwe have been describing; and, as we have just seen, these, when once\r\nin full operation, mutually aid one another. As the eccentricity\r\nincreases century by century, the temperate regions become more and\r\nmore covered with snow and ice, first by reason of the continued\r\nincrease in the coldness and length of the winters, and secondly,\r\nand chiefly, owing to the continued increase in the potency of those\r\nphysical agents which have been called into operation. This glacial\r\nstate of things goes on at an increasing rate, and reaches a maximum\r\nwhen the solstice-point arrives at the aphelion. After the solstice\r\npasses the aphelion, a contrary process commences. The snow and ice\r\ngradually begin to diminish on the cold hemisphere and to make their\r\nappearance on the other hemisphere. The glaciated hemisphere turns, by\r\ndegrees, warmer and the warm hemisphere colder, and this continues to\r\ngo on for a period of ten or twelve thousand years, until the winter\r\nsolstice reaches the perihelion. By this time the conditions of the two\r\nhemispheres have been reversed; the formerly glaciated hemisphere has\r\nnow become the warm one, and the warm hemisphere the glaciated. The\r\ntransference of the ice from the one hemisphere to the other continues\r\nas long as the eccentricity remains at a high value. This will,\r\nperhaps, be better understood from an inspection of the frontispiece.\r\n\r\n_The Mean Temperature of the whole Earth should be greater in Aphelion\r\nthan in Perihelion._—When the eccentricity becomes reduced to about\r\nits present value, its influence on climate is but little felt.\r\nIt is, however, probable that the present extension of ice on the\r\nsouthern hemisphere may, to a considerable extent, be the result of\r\neccentricity. The difference in the climatic conditions of the two\r\nhemispheres is just what should be according to theory:—(1) The mean\r\ntemperature of that hemisphere is less than that of the northern.\r\n(2) The winters of the southern hemisphere are colder than those of\r\nthe northern. (3) The summers, though occurring in perihelion, are\r\nalso comparatively cold; this, as we have seen, is what ought to be\r\naccording to theory. (4) The mean temperature of the whole earth is\r\ngreater in June, when the earth is in aphelion, than in December, when\r\nit is in perihelion. This, I venture to affirm, is also what ought to\r\nfollow according to theory, although this very fact has been adduced\r\nas a proof that eccentricity has at present but little effect on the\r\nclimatic condition of our globe.\r\n\r\nThat the mean temperature of the whole earth would, during the\r\nglacial epoch, be greater when the earth was in aphelion than\r\nwhen in perihelion will, I think, be apparent from the following\r\nconsiderations:—When the earth was in the perihelion, the sun would\r\nbe over the hemisphere nearly covered with snow and ice. The great\r\nstrength of the sun’s rays would in this case have little effect in\r\nraising the temperature; it would be spent in melting the snow and\r\nice. But when the earth was in the aphelion, the sun would be over the\r\nhemisphere comparatively free, or perhaps wholly free, from snow and\r\nice. Consequently, though the intensity of the sun’s rays would be less\r\nthan when the earth was in perihelion, still it ought to have produced\r\na higher temperature, because it would be chiefly employed in heating\r\nthe ground and not consumed in melting snow and ice.\r\n\r\n_Professor Tyndall on the Glacial Epoch._—“So natural,” says Professor\r\nTyndall, “was the association of ice and cold, that even celebrated\r\nmen assumed that all that is needed to produce a great extension of\r\nour glaciers is a diminution of the sun’s temperature. Had they gone\r\nthrough the foregoing reflections and calculations, they would probably\r\nhave demanded _more_ heat instead of less for the production of a\r\nglacial epoch. What they really needed were _condensers_ sufficiently\r\npowerful to congeal the vapour generated by the heat of the sun.” (_The\r\nForms of Water_, p. 154. See also, to the same effect, _Heat Considered\r\nas a Mode of Motion_, chap. vi.)\r\n\r\nI do not know to whom Professor Tyndall here refers, but certainly his\r\nremarks have no application to the theory under consideration, for\r\naccording to it, as we have just seen, the ice of the glacial epoch was\r\nabout as much due to the nearness of the sun in perigee as to his great\r\ndistance in apogee.\r\n\r\nThere is one theory, however, to which his remarks justly apply, viz.,\r\nthe theory that the great changes of climate during geological ages\r\nresulted from the passage of our globe through different temperatures\r\nof space. What Professor Tyndall says shows plainly that the glacial\r\nepoch was not brought about by our earth passing through a cold part\r\nof space. A general reduction of temperature over the whole globe\r\ncertainly would not produce a glacial epoch. Suppose the sun were\r\nextinguished and our globe exposed to the temperature of stellar space\r\n(−239° F.), this would certainly freeze the ocean solid from its\r\nsurface to its bottom, but it would not cover the land with ice.\r\n\r\nProfessor Tyndall’s conclusions are, of course, equally conclusive\r\nagainst Professor Balfour Stewart’s theory, that the glacial epoch may\r\nhave resulted from a general diminution in the intensity of the sun’s\r\nheat.\r\n\r\nNevertheless it would be in direct opposition to the well-established\r\nfacts of geology to assume that the ice periods of the glacial epoch\r\nwere warm periods. We are as certain from palæontological evidence\r\nthat the cold was then much greater than now, as we are from physical\r\nevidence that the accumulation of ice was greater than now. Our glacial\r\nshell-beds and remains of the mammoth, the reindeer, and musk-ox, tell\r\nof cold as truly as the markings on the rocks do of ice.\r\n\r\n_Objection from the Present Condition of the Planet Mars._—It has been\r\nurged as an objection by Professor Charles Martins[46] and others,\r\nthat if a high state of eccentricity could produce a glacial epoch,\r\nthe planet Mars ought to be at present under a glacial condition. The\r\neccentricity of its orbit amounts to 0·09322, and one of its southern\r\nwinter solstices is, according to Dr. Oudemans, of Batavia,[47] within\r\n17° 41′ 8″ of aphelion. Consequently, it is supposed that one of the\r\nhemispheres should be in a glacial state and the other free from snow\r\nand ice. But it is believed that the snow accumulates around each pole\r\nduring its winter and disappears to a great extent during its summer.\r\n\r\nThere would be force in this objection were it maintained that\r\neccentricity alone can produce a glacial condition of climate, but\r\nsuch is not the case, and there is no good ground for concluding that\r\nthose physical agencies which led to the glacial epoch of our globe\r\nexist in the planet Mars. It is perfectly certain that either water\r\nmust be different in constitution in that planet from what it is in our\r\nearth, or else its atmospheric envelope must be totally different from\r\nours. For it is evident from what has been stated in Chapter II., that\r\nwere our globe to be removed to the distance of Mars from the sun, the\r\nlowering of the temperature resulting from the decrease in the sun’s\r\nheat would not only destroy every living thing, but would convert the\r\nocean into solid ice.\r\n\r\nBut it must be observed that the eccentricity of Mars’ orbit is at\r\npresent far from its superior limit of 0·14224, and it may so happen in\r\nthe economy of nature that when it approaches to that limit a glacial\r\ncondition of things may supervene.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, however, that very little seems to be known with\r\ncertainty regarding the climatic condition of Mars. This is obvious\r\nfrom the fact that some astronomers believe that the planet possesses\r\na dense atmosphere which protects it from cold; while others maintain\r\nthat its atmosphere is so exceedingly thin that its mean temperature is\r\nbelow the freezing-point. Some assert that the climatic condition of\r\nMars resembles very much that of our earth, while others affirm that\r\nits seas are actually frozen solid to the bottom, and the poles covered\r\nwith ice thirty or forty miles in thickness. For reasons which will be\r\nexplained in the Appendix, Mars, notwithstanding its greater distance\r\nfrom the sun, may enjoy a climate as warm as that of our earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n         REASON WHY THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE IS COLDER THAN THE\r\n                               NORTHERN.\r\n\r\n  Adhémar’s Explanation.—Adhémar’s Theory founded upon a physical\r\n      Mistake in regard to Radiation.—Professor J. D. Forbes on\r\n      Underground Temperature.—Generally accepted Explanation.—Low\r\n      Temperature of Southern Hemisphere attributed to\r\n      Preponderance of Sea.—Heat transferred from Southern to\r\n      Northern Hemisphere by Ocean-current the true Explanation.—A\r\n      large Portion of the Heat of the Gulf-stream derived from the\r\n      Southern Hemisphere.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Adhémar’s Explanation._—It has long been known that on the southern\r\nhemisphere the temperature is lower and the accumulation of ice greater\r\nthan on the northern. This difference has usually been attributed to\r\nthe great preponderance of sea on the southern hemisphere. M. Adhémar,\r\non the other hand, attempts to explain this difference by referring it\r\nto the difference in the amount of heat lost by the two hemispheres\r\nin consequence of the difference of seven days in the length of their\r\nrespective winters. As the northern winter is shorter than the summer,\r\nhe concludes that there is an accumulation of heat on that hemisphere,\r\nwhile, on the other hand, the southern winter being longer than the\r\nsummer, there is therefore a loss of heat on the southern hemisphere.\r\n“The south pole,” he says, “loses in one year more heat than it\r\nreceives, because the total duration of its night surpasses that of\r\nits day by 168 hours; and the contrary takes place for the north pole.\r\nIf, for example, we take for unity the mean quantity of heat which the\r\nsun sends off in one hour, the heat accumulated at the end of the year\r\nat the north pole will be expressed by 168, while the heat lost by the\r\nsouth pole will be equal to 168 times what the radiation lessens it by\r\nin one hour, so that at the end of the year the difference in the heat\r\nof the two hemispheres will be represented by 336 times what the earth\r\nreceives from the sun or loses in an hour by radiation.”[48]\r\n\r\nAdhémar supposes that about 10,000 years hence, when our northern\r\nwinter will occur in aphelion and the southern in perihelion, the\r\nclimatic conditions of the two hemispheres will be reversed; the\r\nice will melt at the south pole, and the northern hemisphere will\r\nbecome enveloped in one continuous mass of ice, leagues in thickness,\r\nextending down to temperate regions.\r\n\r\nThis theory seems to be based upon an erroneous interpretation of a\r\nprinciple, first pointed out, so far as I am aware, by Humboldt in\r\nhis memoir “On Isothermal Lines and Distribution of Heat over the\r\nGlobe.”[49] This principle may be stated as follows:—\r\n\r\nAlthough the total quantity of heat received by the earth from the\r\nsun in one revolution is inversely proportional to the minor axis of\r\nthe orbit, yet this amount, as was proved by D’Alembert, is equally\r\ndistributed between the two hemispheres, whatever the eccentricity may\r\nbe. Whatever extra heat the southern hemisphere may at present receive\r\nfrom the sun daily during its summer months owing to greater proximity\r\nto the sun, is exactly compensated by a corresponding loss arising from\r\nthe shortness of the season; and, on the other hand, whatever daily\r\ndeficiency of heat we in the northern hemisphere may at present have\r\nduring our summer half-year, in consequence of the earth’s distance\r\nfrom the sun, is also exactly compensated by a corresponding length of\r\nseason.\r\n\r\nBut the surface temperature of our globe depends as much upon the\r\namount of heat radiated into space as upon the amount derived from the\r\nsun, and it has been thought by some that this compensating principle\r\nholds true only in regard to the latter. In the case of the heat\r\nlost by radiation the reverse is supposed to take place. The southern\r\nhemisphere, it is asserted, has not only a colder winter than the\r\nnorthern in consequence of the sun’s greater distance, but it has also\r\na longer winter; and the extra loss of heat from radiation during\r\nwinter is not compensated by its nearness to the sun during summer, for\r\nit gains no additional heat from this proximity. And in the same way it\r\nis argued that as our winter in the northern hemisphere, owing to the\r\nless distance of the sun, is not only warmer than that of the southern\r\nhemisphere, but is also at the same time shorter, so our hemisphere\r\nis not cooled to such an extent as the southern. And thus the mean\r\ntemperature of the winter half-year, as well as the intensity of the\r\nsun’s heat, is affected by a change in the sun’s distance.\r\n\r\nAlthough I always regarded this cause of Humboldt’s to be utterly\r\ninadequate to produce such effects as those attributed to it by\r\nAdhémar, still, in my earlier papers[50] I stated it to be a _vera\r\ncausa_ which ought to produce some sensible effect on climate. But\r\nshortly afterwards on a more careful consideration of the whole\r\nsubject, I was led to suspect that the circumstance in question can,\r\naccording to theory, produce little or no effect on the climatic\r\ncondition of our globe.\r\n\r\nAs there appears to be a considerable amount of misapprehension in\r\nreference to this point, which forms the basis of Adhémar’s theory, I\r\nmay here give it a brief consideration.[51]\r\n\r\nThe rate at which the earth radiates into space the heat received\r\nfrom the sun depends upon the temperature of its surface; and the\r\ntemperature of its surface (other things being equal) depends upon\r\nthe rate at which the heat is received. The greater the rate at which\r\nthe earth receives heat from the sun, the greater will therefore be\r\nthe rate at which it will lose that heat by radiation. Now the total\r\nquantity of heat received during winter by the southern hemisphere is\r\nexactly equal to that received during winter by the northern. But as\r\nthe southern winter is longer than the northern, the rate at which the\r\nheat is received, and consequently the rate of radiation, during that\r\nseason must be less on the southern hemisphere than on the northern.\r\nThus the southern hemisphere loses heat during a longer period than the\r\nnorthern, and therefore the less rate of radiation (were it not for a\r\ncircumstance presently to be noticed) would wholly compensate for the\r\nlonger period, and the total quantity of heat lost during winter would\r\nbe the same on both hemispheres. The southern summer is shorter than\r\nthe northern, but the heat is more intense, and the surface of the\r\nground kept at a higher temperature; consequently the rate of radiation\r\ninto space is greater.\r\n\r\nWhen the rate at which a body receives heat is increased, the\r\ntemperature of the body rises till the rate of radiation equals the\r\nrate of absorption, after which equilibrium is restored; and when the\r\nrate of absorption is diminished, the temperature falls till the rate\r\nof radiation equals that of absorption.\r\n\r\nBut notwithstanding all this, owing to the slow conductivity of the\r\nground for heat, more heat will pass into it during the longer summer\r\nof aphelion than during the shorter one of perihelion; for the amount\r\nof heat which passes into the ground depends on the length of time\r\nduring which the earth is receiving heat, as well as upon the amount\r\nreceived. In like manner, more heat will pass out of the ground\r\nduring the longer winter in aphelion than during the shorter one in\r\nperihelion. Suppose the length of the days on the one hemisphere (say\r\nthe northern) to be 23 hours, and the length of the nights, say one\r\nhour; while on the other hemisphere the days are one hour and the\r\nnights 23 hours. Suppose also that the quantity of heat received from\r\nthe sun by the southern hemisphere during the day of one hour to be\r\nequal to that received by the northern hemisphere during the day of\r\n23 hours. It is evident that although the surface of the ground on\r\nthe southern hemisphere would receive as much heat from the sun during\r\nthe short day of one hour as the surface of the northern hemisphere\r\nduring the long day of 23 hours, yet, owing to the slow conductivity\r\nof the ground for heat, the amount absorbed would not be nearly so\r\nmuch on the southern hemisphere as on the northern. The temperature\r\nof the surface during the day, it is true, would be far higher on the\r\nsouthern hemisphere than on the northern, and consequently the rate\r\nat which the heat would pass into the ground would be greater on that\r\nhemisphere than on the northern; but, notwithstanding the greater rate\r\nof absorption resulting from the high temperature of the surface, it\r\nwould not compensate for the shortness of the day. On the other hand,\r\nthe surface of the ground on the southern hemisphere would be colder\r\nduring the long night of 23 hours than it would be on the northern\r\nduring the short night of only one hour; and the low temperature of the\r\nground would tend to lessen the rate of radiation into space. But the\r\ndecrease in the rate of radiation would not compensate fully for the\r\ngreat length of the night. The general and combined result of all those\r\ncauses would be that a slight accumulation of heat would take place on\r\nthe northern hemisphere and a slight loss on the southern. But this\r\nloss of heat on the one hemisphere and gain on the other would not go\r\non accumulating at a uniform rate year by year, as Adhémar supposes.\r\n\r\nOf course we are at present simply considering the earth as an absorber\r\nand radiator of heat, without taking into account the effects of\r\ndistribution of sea and land and other modifying causes, and are\r\nassuming that everything is the same in both hemispheres, with the\r\nexception that the winter of the one hemisphere is longer than that of\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, is the amount of heat stored up by the one hemisphere and\r\nlost by the other? Is it such an amount as to sensibly affect climate?\r\n\r\nThe experiments and observations which have been made on underground\r\ntemperature afford us a means of making at least a rough estimate of\r\nthe amount. And from these it will be seen that the influence of an\r\nexcess of seven or eight days in the length of the southern winter over\r\nthe northern could hardly produce an effect that would be sensible.\r\n\r\nObservations were made at Edinburgh by Professor J. D. Forbes on\r\nthree different substances; viz., sandstone, sand, and trap-rock. By\r\ncalculation, we find from the data afforded by those observations that\r\nthe total quantity of heat accumulated in the ground during the summer\r\nabove the mean temperature was as follows:—In the sandstone-rock, a\r\nquantity sufficient to raise the temperature of the rock 1° C. to a\r\ndepth of 85 feet 6 inches; in the sand a quantity sufficient to raise\r\nthe temperature 1° C. to a depth of 72 feet 6 inches; and in the\r\ntrap-rock a quantity only sufficient to raise the temperature 1° C. to\r\na depth of 61 feet 6 inches.\r\n\r\nTaking the specific heat of the sandstone per unit volume, as\r\ndetermined by Regnault, at ·4623, and that of sand at ·3006, and\r\ntrap at ·5283, and reducing all the results to one standard, viz.,\r\nthat of water, we find that the quantity of heat stored up in the\r\nsandstone would, if applied to water, raise its temperature 1° C. to\r\na depth of 39 feet 6 inches; that stored up in the sand would raise\r\nthe temperature of the water 1° C. to a depth of 21 feet 8 inches, and\r\nthat stored up in the trap would raise the water 1° C. to the depth\r\nof 32 feet 6 inches. We may take the mean of these three results as\r\nrepresenting pretty accurately the quantity stored up in the general\r\nsurface of the country. This would be equal to 31 feet 3 inches depth\r\nof water raised 1° C. The quantity of heat lost by radiation during\r\nwinter below the mean was found to be about equal to that stored up\r\nduring summer.\r\n\r\nThe total quantity of heat per square foot of surface received by the\r\nequator from sunrise till sunset at the time of the equinoxes, allowing\r\n22 per cent. for the amount cut off in passing through the atmosphere,\r\nis 1,780,474 foot-pounds. In the latitude of Edinburgh about 938,460\r\nfoot-pounds per square foot of surface is received, assuming that not\r\nmore than 22 per cent. is cut off by the atmosphere. At this rate a\r\nquantity of heat would be received from the sun in two days ten hours\r\n(say, three days) sufficient to raise the temperature of the water 1°\r\nC. to the required depth of 31 feet 3 inches. Consequently the total\r\nquantity of heat stored up during summer in the latitude of Edinburgh\r\nis only equal to what we receive from the sun during three days at the\r\ntime of the equinoxes. Three days’ sunshine during the middle of March\r\nor September, if applied to raise the temperature of the ground, would\r\nrestore all the heat lost during the entire winter; and another three\r\ndays’ sunshine would confer on the ground as much heat as is stored\r\nup during the entire summer. But it must be observed that the total\r\nduration of sunshine in winter is to that of summer in the latitude of\r\nEdinburgh only about as 4 to 7. Here is a difference of two months.\r\nBut this is not all; the quantity of heat received during winter is\r\nscarcely one-third of that received during summer; yet, notwithstanding\r\nthis enormous difference between summer and winter, the ground during\r\nwinter loses only about six days’ sun-heat below the maximum amount\r\npossessed by it in summer.\r\n\r\nBut if what has already been stated is correct, this loss of heat\r\nsustained by the earth during winter is not chiefly owing to radiation\r\nduring the longer absence of the sun, but to the decrease in the\r\nquantity of heat received in consequence of his longer absence combined\r\nwith the obliquity of his rays during that season. Now in the case\r\nof the two hemispheres, although the southern winter is longer than\r\nthe northern, yet the quantity of heat received by each is the same.\r\nBut supposing it held true, which it does not, that the loss of\r\nheat sustained by the earth in winter is as much owing to radiation\r\nresulting from the excess in the length of the winter nights over those\r\nof the summer as to the deficiency of heat received in winter from that\r\nreceived in summer, three days’ heat would then in this case be the\r\namount lost by radiation in consequence of this excess in the length of\r\nthe winter nights. The total length of the winter nights to those of\r\nthe summer is, as we have seen, about as 7 to 4. This is a difference\r\nof nearly 1200 hours. But the excess of the south polar winter over the\r\nnorth amounts to only about 184 hours. Now if 1200 hours give a loss of\r\nthree days’ sun-heat, 184 hours will give a loss of scarcely 5½ hours.\r\n\r\nIt is no doubt true that the two cases are not exactly analogous; but\r\nit is obvious that any error which can possibly arise from regarding\r\nthem as such cannot materially alter the conclusion to which we have\r\narrived. Supposing the effect were double, or even quadruple, what\r\nwe have concluded it to be, still it would not amount to a loss of\r\ntwo days’ heat, which could certainly have little or no influence on\r\nclimate.\r\n\r\nBut even assuming all the preceding reasoning to be incorrect, and that\r\nthe southern hemisphere, in consequence of its longer winter, loses\r\nheat to the extravagant extent of 168 hours, supposed by Adhémar, still\r\nthis could not materially affect climate. The climate is influenced\r\nby the mere _temperature_ of the _surface_ of the ground, and not by\r\nthe quantity of heat or cold that may be stored up under the surface.\r\nThe climate is determined, so far as the ground is concerned, by\r\nthe temperature of the surface, and is wholly independent of the\r\ntemperature which may exist under the surface. Underground temperature\r\ncan only affect climate through the surface. If the surface could,\r\nfor example, be kept covered with perpetual snow, we should have a\r\ncold and sterile climate, although the temperature of the ground under\r\nthe snow was actually at the boiling-point. Let the ground to a depth\r\nof, say 40 or 50 feet, be deprived of an amount of heat equal to that\r\nreceived from the sun in 168 hours. This could produce little or no\r\nsensible effect on climate; for, owing to the slow conductivity of the\r\nground for heat, this loss would not sensibly affect the temperature\r\nof the surface, as it would take several months for the sun’s heat\r\nto penetrate to that depth and restore the lost heat. The cold, if I\r\nmay be allowed to use the expression, would come so slowly out to the\r\nsurface that its effect in lowering the temperature of the surface\r\nwould scarcely be sensible. And, again, if we suppose the 168 hours’\r\nheat to be lost by the mere surface of the ground, the effect would\r\ncertainly be sensible, but it would only be so for a few days. We\r\nmight in this case have a week’s frozen soil, but that would be all.\r\nBefore the air had time to become very sensibly affected by the low\r\ntemperature of the surface the frozen soil would be thawed.\r\n\r\nThe storing up of heat or cold in the ground has in reality very little\r\nto do with climate. Some physicists explain, for example, why the month\r\nof July is warmer than June by referring it to the fact that by the\r\nmonth of July the ground has become possessed of a larger accumulation\r\nof heat than it possessed in June. This explanation is evidently\r\nerroneous. The ground in July certainly possesses a greater store of\r\nheat than it did in June; but this is not the reason why the former\r\nmonth is hotter than the latter. July is hotter than June because the\r\n_air_ (not the _ground_) has become possessed of a larger store of\r\nheat than it had in June. Now the air is warmer in July than in June\r\nbecause, receiving little increase of temperature from the direct rays\r\nof the sun, it is heated chiefly by radiation from the earth and by\r\ncontact with its warm surface. Consequently, although the sun’s heat\r\nis greater in June than it is in July, it is near the middle of July\r\nbefore the air becomes possessed of its maximum store of heat. We\r\ntherefore say that July is hotter than June because the air is hotter,\r\nand consequently the temperature in the shade is greater in the former\r\nmonth than in the latter.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore, I presume, quite apparent that Adhémar’s theory fails\r\nto explain why the southern hemisphere is colder than the northern.\r\n\r\n_The generally accepted Explanation._—The difference in the mean\r\ntemperature of the two hemispheres is usually attributed to the\r\nproportion of sea to land in the southern hemisphere and of land to\r\nsea in the northern hemisphere. This, no doubt, will account for the\r\ngreater _annual range_ of temperature on the northern hemisphere,\r\nbut it seems to me that it will not account for the excess of _mean_\r\ntemperature possessed by that hemisphere over the southern.\r\n\r\nThe general influence of land on climate is to exaggerate the\r\nvariation of temperature due to the seasons. On continents the summers\r\nare hotter and the winters colder than on the ocean. The days are\r\nalso hotter and the nights colder on land than on sea. This is a\r\nresult which follows from the mere physical properties of land and\r\nwater, independently of currents, whether of ocean or of air. But it\r\nnevertheless follows, according to theory (and this is a point which\r\nhas been overlooked), that the mean annual temperature of the ocean\r\nought to be greater than that of the land in equatorial regions as\r\nwell as in temperate and polar regions. This will appear obvious for\r\nthe following reasons:—(1) The ground stores up heat only by the slow\r\nprocess of conduction, whereas water, by the mobility of its particles\r\nand its transparency for heat-rays, especially those from the sun,\r\nbecomes heated to a considerable depth rapidly. The quantity of heat\r\nstored up in the ground is thus comparatively small, while the quantity\r\nstored up in the ocean is great. (2) The air is probably heated more\r\nrapidly by contact with the ground than with the ocean; but, on the\r\nother hand, it is heated far more rapidly by radiation from the ocean\r\nthan from the land. The aqueous vapour of the air is to a great extent\r\ndiathermanous to radiation from the ground, while it absorbs the\r\nrays from water and thus becomes heated. (3) The air radiates back a\r\nconsiderable portion of its heat, and the ocean absorbs this radiation\r\nfrom the air more readily than the ground does. The ocean will not\r\nreflect the heat from the aqueous vapour of the air, but absorbs it,\r\nwhile the ground does the opposite. Radiation from the air, therefore,\r\ntends more readily to heat the ocean than it does the land. (4) The\r\naqueous vapour of the air acts as a screen to prevent the loss by\r\nradiation from water, while it allows radiation from the ground to pass\r\nmore freely into space; the atmosphere over the ocean consequently\r\nthrows back a greater amount of heat than is thrown back by the\r\natmosphere over the land. The sea in this case has a much greater\r\ndifficulty than the land has in getting quit of the heat received from\r\nthe sun; in other words, the land tends to lose its heat more rapidly\r\nthan the sea. The consequence of all these circumstances is that the\r\nocean must stand at a higher mean temperature than the land. A state of\r\nequilibrium is never gained until the rate at which a body is receiving\r\nheat is equal to the rate at which it is losing it; but as equal\r\nsurfaces of sea and land receive from the sun the same amount of heat,\r\nit therefore follows that, in order that the sea may get quit of its\r\nheat as rapidly as the land, it _must stand at a higher temperature_\r\nthan the land. The temperature of the sea must continue to rise till\r\nthe amount of heat thrown off into space equals that received from the\r\nsun; when this point is reached, equilibrium is established and the\r\ntemperature remains stationary. But, owing to the greater difficulty\r\nthat the sea has in getting rid of its heat, the mean temperature\r\nof equilibrium of the ocean must be higher than that of the land;\r\nconsequently the mean temperature of the ocean, and also of the air\r\nimmediately over it, in tropical regions should be higher than the mean\r\ntemperature of the land and the air over it.\r\n\r\nThe greater portion of the southern hemisphere, however, is occupied by\r\nwater, and why then, it may be asked, is this water hemisphere colder\r\nthan the land hemisphere? Ought it not also to follow that the sea in\r\ninter-tropical regions should be warmer than the land under the same\r\nparallels; yet, as we know, the reverse is actually found to be the\r\ncase. How then is all this to be explained, if the foregoing reasoning\r\nbe correct? We find when we examine Professor Dove’s charts of mean\r\nannual temperature, that the ocean in inter-tropical regions has a\r\nmean annual temperature below the normal, and the land a mean annual\r\ntemperature above the normal. Both in the Pacific and in the Atlantic\r\nthe mean temperature sinks to 2°·3 below the normal, while on the\r\nland it rises 4°·6 above the normal. The explanation in this case is\r\nobviously this: the temperature of the ocean in inter-tropical regions,\r\nas we have already seen, is kept much lower than it would otherwise be\r\nby the enormous amount of _heat_ that is being constantly carried away\r\nfrom those regions into temperate and polar regions, and of _cold_ that\r\nis being constantly carried from temperate and polar regions to the\r\ntropical regions by means of ocean-currents. The same principle which\r\nexplains why the sea in inter-tropical regions has a lower mean annual\r\ntemperature than the land, explains also why the southern hemisphere\r\nhas a lower mean annual temperature than the northern. The temperature\r\nof the southern hemisphere is lowered by the transference of heat by\r\nmeans of ocean-currents.\r\n\r\n_Heat transferred from the Southern to the Northern Hemisphere by\r\nOcean-currents the true Explanation._—The great ocean-currents of\r\nthe globe take their rise in three immense streams from the Southern\r\nOcean, which, on reaching the tropical regions, become deflected in\r\na westerly direction and flow along the southern side of the equator\r\nfor thousands of miles. Perhaps more than one half of this mass of\r\nmoving water returns into the Southern Ocean without ever crossing the\r\nequator, but the quantity which crosses over to the northern hemisphere\r\nis enormous. This constant flow of water from the southern hemisphere\r\nto the northern in the form of surface currents must be compensated by\r\n_under currents_ of equal magnitude from the northern hemisphere to the\r\nsouthern. The currents, however, which cross the equator are far higher\r\nin temperature than their compensating under currents; consequently\r\nthere is a constant transference of heat from the southern hemisphere\r\nto the northern. Any currents taking their rise in the northern\r\nhemisphere and flowing across into the southern are comparatively\r\ntrifling, and the amount of heat transferred by them is also trifling.\r\nThere are one or two currents of considerable size, such as the\r\nBrazilian branch of the great equatorial current of the Atlantic, and\r\na part of the South Equatorial Drift-current of the Pacific, which\r\ncross the equator from north to south; but these cannot be regarded as\r\nnorthern currents; they are simply southern currents deflected back\r\nafter crossing over to the northern hemisphere. The heat which these\r\ncurrents possess is chiefly obtained on the southern hemisphere before\r\ncrossing over to the northern; and although the northern hemisphere may\r\nnot gain much heat by means of them, it, on the other hand, does not\r\nlose much, for the heat which they give out in their progress along the\r\nsouthern hemisphere does not belong to the northern hemisphere.\r\n\r\nBut, after making the fullest allowance for the amount of heat carried\r\nacross the equator from the northern hemisphere to the southern, we\r\nshall find, if we compare the mean temperature of the currents from\r\nsouth to north with that of the great compensating under currents and\r\nthe one or two small surface currents, that the former is very much\r\nhigher than the latter. The mean temperature of the water crossing the\r\nequator from south to north is probably not under 65°, that of the\r\nunder currents is probably not over 39°. But to the under currents\r\nwe must add the surface currents from north to south; and assuming\r\nthat this will raise the mean temperature of the entire mass of water\r\nflowing south to, say, 45°, we have still a difference of 20° between\r\nthe temperature of the masses flowing north and south. Each cubic\r\nfoot of water which crosses the equator will in this case transfer\r\nabout 965,000 foot-pounds of heat from the southern hemisphere to the\r\nnorthern. If we had any means of ascertaining the volume of those great\r\ncurrents crossing the equator, we should then be able to make a rough\r\nestimate of the total amount of heat transferred from the southern\r\nhemisphere to the northern; but as yet no accurate estimate has been\r\nmade on this point. Let us assume, what is probably below the truth,\r\nthat the total amount of water crossing the equator is at least double\r\nthat of the Gulf-stream as it passes through the Straits of Florida,\r\nwhich amount we have already found to be equal to 66,908,160,000,000\r\ncubic feet daily. Taking the quantity of heat conveyed by each cubic\r\nfoot of water of the Gulf-stream as 1,158,000 foot-pounds, it is\r\nfound, as we have seen, that an amount of heat is conveyed by this\r\ncurrent equal to all the heat that falls within 32 miles on each\r\nside of the equator. Then, if each cubic foot of water crossing the\r\nequator transfers 965,000 foot-pounds, and the quantity of water be\r\ndouble that of the Gulf-stream, it follows that the amount of heat\r\ntransferred from the southern hemisphere to the northern is equal to\r\nall the heat falling within 52 miles on each side of the equator, or\r\nequal to all the heat falling on the southern hemisphere within 104\r\nmiles of the equator. This quantity taken from the southern hemisphere\r\nand added to the northern will therefore make a difference in the\r\namount of heat possessed by the two hemispheres equal to all the heat\r\nwhich falls on the southern hemisphere within somewhat more than 208\r\nmiles of the equator.\r\n\r\n_A large Portion of the Heat of the Gulf-stream derived from the\r\nSouthern Hemisphere._—It can be proved that a very large portion of the\r\nheat conveyed by the Gulf-stream comes from the southern hemisphere.\r\nThe proof is as follows:—\r\n\r\nIf all the heat came from the northern hemisphere, it could only come\r\nfrom that portion of the Atlantic, Caribbean Sea, and Gulf of Mexico\r\nwhich lies to the north of the equator. The entire area of these seas,\r\nextending to the Tropic of Cancer, is about 7,700,000 square miles.\r\nBut this area is not sufficient to supply the current passing through\r\nthe “Narrows” with the necessary heat. Were the heat which passes\r\nthrough the Straits of Florida derived exclusively from this area, the\r\nfollowing table would then represent the relative quantity per unit\r\nsurface possessed by the Atlantic in the three zones, assuming that one\r\nhalf of the heat of the Gulf-stream passes into the arctic regions and\r\nthe other half remains to warm the temperate regions[52]:—\r\n\r\n  From the equator to the Tropic of Cancer         773\r\n  From the Tropic of Cancer to the Arctic Circle   848\r\n  From the Arctic Circle to the North Pole         610\r\n\r\nThese figures show that the Atlantic, from the equator to the Tropic\r\nof Cancer, would be as cold as from the Tropic of Cancer to the North\r\nPole, were it not that a large proportion of the heat possessed by the\r\nGulf-stream is derived from the southern hemisphere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n           EXAMINATION OF THE GRAVITATION THEORY OF OCEANIC\r\n                  CIRCULATION.—LIEUT. MAURY’S THEORY.\r\n\r\n  Introduction.—Ocean-currents, according to Maury, due to\r\n      Difference of Specific Gravity.—Difference of Specific\r\n      Gravity resulting from Difference of Temperature.—Difference\r\n      of Specific Gravity resulting from Difference of\r\n      Saltness.—Maury’s two Causes neutralize each other.—How,\r\n      according to him, Difference in Saltness acts as a Cause.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Introduction._—Few subjects have excited more interest and attention\r\nthan the cause of ocean circulation; and yet few are in a more\r\nimperfect and unsatisfactory condition, nor is there any question\r\nregarding which a greater diversity of opinion has prevailed. Our\r\nincomplete acquaintance with the facts relating to the currents of the\r\nocean and the modes of circulation actually in operation, is no doubt\r\none reason for this state of things. But doubtless the principal cause\r\nof such diversity of opinion lies in the fact that the question is one\r\nwhich properly belongs to the domain of physics and mechanics, while\r\nas yet no physicist of note (if we except Dr. Colding, of Copenhagen)\r\nhas given, as far as I know, any special attention to the subject. It\r\nis true that in works of meteorology and physical geography reference\r\nis continually made to such eminent physicists as Herschel, Pouillet,\r\nBuff, and others; but when we turn to the writings of these authors we\r\nfind merely a few remarks expressive of their opinions on the subject,\r\nand no special discussion or investigation of the matter, nor anything\r\nwhich could warrant us in concluding that such investigations have ever\r\nbeen made. At present the question cannot be decided by a reference to\r\nauthorities.\r\n\r\nThe various theories on the subject may be classed under two divisions;\r\nthe first of these attributes the motion of the water to the _impulse\r\nof the wind_, and the second to the _force of gravity_ resulting from\r\ndifference of density. But even amongst those who adopt the former\r\ntheory, it is generally held that the winds are not the sole cause,\r\nbut that, to a certain extent at least, difference of specific gravity\r\ncontributes to produce motion of the waters. This is a very natural\r\nconclusion; and in the present state of physical geography on this\r\nsubject one can hardly be expected to hold any other view.\r\n\r\nThe supporters of the latter theory may be subdivided into two\r\nclasses. The first of these (of which Maury may be regarded as the\r\nrepresentative) attributes the Gulf-stream, and other sensible currents\r\nof the ocean, to difference of specific gravity. The other class (at\r\npresent the more popular of the two, and of which Dr. Carpenter may be\r\nconsidered the representative) denies altogether that such currents can\r\nbe produced by difference of specific gravity,[53] and affirms that\r\nthere is a general movement of the upper portion of the ocean from the\r\nequator to the poles, and a counter-movement of the under portion from\r\nthe poles to the equator. This movement is attributed to difference of\r\nspecific gravity between equatorial and polar water, resulting from\r\ndifference of temperature.\r\n\r\nThe widespread popularity of the gravitation theory is no doubt, to a\r\ngreat extent, owing to the very great prominence given to it by Lieut.\r\nMaury in his interesting and popular work, “The Physical Geography of\r\nthe Sea.” Another cause which must have favoured the reception of this\r\ntheory is the ease with which it is perceived how, according to it,\r\ncirculation of the waters of the ocean is supposed to follow. One has\r\nno difficulty, for example, in perceiving that if the inter-tropical\r\nwaters of the ocean are expanded by heat, and the waters around the\r\npoles contracted by cold, the surface of the ocean will stand at a\r\nhigher level at the equator than at the poles. Equilibrium being\r\nthus disturbed, the water at the equator will tend to flow towards\r\nthe poles as a surface current, and the water at the poles towards\r\nthe equator as an under current. This, at first sight, looks well,\r\nespecially to those who take but a superficial view of the matter.\r\n\r\nWe shall examine this theory at some length, for two reasons: 1,\r\nbecause it lies at the root of a great deal of the confusion and\r\nmisconception which have prevailed in regard to the whole subject of\r\nocean-currents: 2, because, if the theory is correct, it militates\r\nstrongly against the physical theory of secular changes of climate\r\nadvanced in this volume. We have already seen (Chapter IV.) that\r\nwhen the eccentricity of the earth’s orbit reaches a high value, a\r\ncombination of physical circumstances tends to lower the temperature of\r\nthe hemisphere which has its winter solstice in aphelion, and to raise\r\nthe temperature of the opposite hemisphere, whose winter solstice will,\r\nof course, be in perihelion. The direct result of this state of things,\r\nas was shown, is to strengthen the force of the trade-winds on the\r\ncold hemisphere, and to weaken their strength on the warm hemisphere:\r\nand this, in turn, we also saw, tends to impel the warm water of\r\nthe inter-tropical region on to the warm hemisphere, and to prevent\r\nit, in a very large degree, from passing into the cold hemisphere.\r\nThis deflection of the ocean-currents tends to an enormous extent to\r\nincrease the difference of temperature previously existing between the\r\ntwo hemispheres. In other words, the warm and equable condition of the\r\none hemisphere, and the cold and glacial condition of the other, are,\r\nto a great extent, due to this deflection of ocean-currents. But if\r\nthe theory be correct which attributes the motion of ocean-currents to\r\na difference in density between the sea in inter-tropical and polar\r\nregions, then it follows that these currents (other things being\r\nequal) ought to be stronger on the cold hemisphere than on the warm,\r\nbecause there is a greater difference of temperature and, consequently,\r\na greater difference of density, between the polar seas of the cold\r\nhemisphere and the equatorial seas, than between the polar seas of the\r\nwarm hemisphere and the equatorial seas. And this being the case,\r\nnotwithstanding the influence of the trade-winds of the cold hemisphere\r\nblowing over upon the warm, the currents will, in all probability,\r\nbe stronger on the cold hemisphere than on the warm. In other words,\r\nthe influence of the powerful trade-winds of the cold hemisphere to\r\ntransfer the warm water of the equator to the warm hemisphere will\r\nprobably be more than counterbalanced by the tendency of the warm\r\nand buoyant waters of the equator to flow towards the dense and cold\r\nwaters around the pole of the cold hemisphere. But if ocean-currents\r\nare due not to difference in specific gravity, but to the influence of\r\nthe winds, then it is evident that the waters at the equator will be\r\nimpelled, not into the cold hemisphere, but into the warm.\r\n\r\nFor this reason I have been the more anxious to prove that\r\ninter-tropical heat is conveyed to temperate and polar regions by\r\nocean-currents, and not by means of any general movement of the ocean\r\nresulting from difference of gravity. I shall therefore on this account\r\nenter more fully into this part of the subject than I otherwise would\r\nhave done. Irrespective of all this, however, the important nature of\r\nthe whole question, and the very general interest it excites, warrant a\r\nfull consideration of the subject.\r\n\r\nI shall consider first that form of the gravitation theory advocated\r\nby Maury in his work on the “Physical Geography of the Sea,” which\r\nattributes the motion of the Gulf-stream and other sensible currents\r\nof the ocean to differences of specific gravity. One reason which has\r\ninduced me to select Maury’s work is, that it not only contains a much\r\nfuller discussion on the cause of the motion of ocean-currents than is\r\nto be found anywhere else, but also that it has probably passed through\r\na greater number of editions than any other book of a scientific\r\ncharacter in the English language in the same length of time.\r\n\r\n_Examination of Lieut. Maury’s Gravitation Theory._—Although Lieut.\r\nMaury has expounded his views on the cause of ocean-currents at\r\ngreat length in the various editions of his work, yet it is somewhat\r\ndifficult to discover what they really are. This arises chiefly\r\nfrom the generally confused and sometimes contradictory nature of\r\nhis hydrodynamical conceptions. After a repeated perusal of several\r\neditions of his book, the following, I trust, will be found to be a\r\npretty accurate representation of his theory:—\r\n\r\n_Ocean-currents, according to Maury, due to Difference of Specific\r\nGravity._—Although Maury alludes to a number of causes which, he\r\nthinks, tend to produce currents, yet he deems their influence so\r\nsmall that, practically, all currents may be referred to difference of\r\nspecific gravity.\r\n\r\n“If we except,” he says, “the tides, and the partial currents of the\r\nsea, such as those that may be created by the wind, we may lay it down\r\nas a rule that all the currents of the ocean owe their origin to the\r\ndifferences of specific gravity between sea-water at one place and\r\nsea-water at another; for wherever there is such a difference, whether\r\nit be owing to difference of temperature or to difference of saltness,\r\n&c., it is a difference that disturbs equilibrium, and currents are the\r\nconsequence” (§ 467)[54]. To the same effect see §§ 896, 37, 512, 520,\r\nand 537.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the fact that he is continually referring to difference\r\nof specific gravity as the great cause of currents, it is difficult to\r\nunderstand in what way he conceives this difference to act as a cause.\r\n\r\nDifference of specific gravity between the waters of the ocean at one\r\nplace and another can give rise to currents only through the influence\r\nof the earth’s gravity. All currents resulting from difference of\r\nspecific gravity can be ultimately resolved into the general principle\r\nthat the molecules that are specifically heavier _descend_ and displace\r\nthose that are specifically lighter. If, for example, the ocean at the\r\nequator be expanded by heat or by any other cause, it will be forced by\r\nthe denser waters in temperate and polar regions to rise so that its\r\nsurface shall stand at a higher level than the surface of the ocean in\r\nthese regions. The surface of the ocean will become an inclined plane,\r\nsloping from the equator to the poles. Hydro-statically, the ocean,\r\nconsidered as a mass, will then be in a state of equilibrium; but the\r\nindividual molecules will not be in equilibrium. The molecules at the\r\nsurface in this case may be regarded as lying on an inclined plane\r\nsloping from the equator down to the poles, and as these molecules\r\nare at liberty to move they will not remain at rest, but will descend\r\nthe incline towards the poles. When the waters at the equator are\r\nexpanded, or the waters at the poles contracted, gravitation makes, as\r\nit were, a twofold effort to restore equilibrium. It in the first place\r\nsinks the waters at the poles, and raises the waters at the equator,\r\nin order that the two masses may balance each other; but this very\r\neffort of gravitation to restore equilibrium to the mass destroys the\r\nequilibrium of the molecules by disturbing the level of the ocean. It\r\nthen, in the second place, endeavours to restore equilibrium to the\r\nmolecules by pulling the lighter surface water at the equator down the\r\nincline towards the poles. This tends not only to restore the level\r\nof the ocean, but to bring the lighter water to occupy the surface\r\nand the denser water the bottom of the ocean; and when this is done,\r\ncomplete equilibrium is restored, both to the mass of the ocean and\r\nto its individual molecules, and all further motion ceases. But if\r\nheat be constantly applied to the waters of the equatorial regions,\r\nand cold to those of the polar regions, and a permanent disturbance of\r\nequilibrium maintained, then the continual effort of gravitation to\r\nrestore equilibrium will give rise to a constant current. In this case,\r\nthe heat and the cold (the agents which disturb the equilibrium of the\r\nocean) may be regarded as causes of the current, inasmuch as without\r\nthem the current would not exist; but the real efficient cause, that\r\nwhich impels the water forward, is the force of gravity. But the force\r\nof gravity, as has already been noticed, cannot produce motion (perform\r\nwork) unless the thing acted upon _descend_. Descent is implied in\r\nthe very conception of a current produced by difference of specific\r\ngravity.\r\n\r\nBut Maury speaks as if difference of specific gravity could give rise\r\nto a current without any descent.\r\n\r\n“It is not necessary,” he says, “to associate with oceanic currents\r\nthe idea that they must of necessity, as on land, run from a higher to\r\na lower level. So far from this being the case, some currents of the\r\nsea actually run up hill, while others run on a level. The Gulf-stream\r\nis of the first class” (§ 403). “The top of the Gulf-stream runs on a\r\nlevel with the ocean; therefore we know it is not a descending current”\r\n(§ 18). And in § 9 he says that between the Straits of Florida and\r\nCape Hatteras the waters of the Gulf-stream “are actually forced up an\r\ninclined plane, whose submarine ascent is not less than 10 inches to\r\nthe mile.” To the same effect see §§ 25, 59.\r\n\r\nIt is perfectly true that “it is not necessary to associate with\r\nocean-currents the idea that they must of necessity, as on land,\r\nrun from a higher to a lower level.” But the reason of this is that\r\nocean-currents do not, like the currents on land, owe their motion to\r\nthe force of gravitation. If ocean-currents result from difference of\r\nspecific gravity between the waters in tropical and polar regions,\r\nas Maury maintains, then it is necessary to assume that they are\r\ndescending currents. Whatever be the cause which may give rise to a\r\ndifference of specific gravity, the motion which results from this\r\ndifference is due wholly to the force of gravity; but gravity can\r\nproduce no motion unless the water _descend_.\r\n\r\nThis fact must be particularly borne in mind while we are considering\r\nMaury’s theory that currents are the result of difference of specific\r\ngravity.\r\n\r\nOcean-currents, then, according to that writer, owe their existence to\r\nthe difference of specific gravity between the waters of inter-tropical\r\nand polar regions. This difference of specific gravity he attributes to\r\ntwo causes—(1) to difference as to _temperature_, (2) to difference as\r\nto saltness. There are one or two causes of a minor nature affecting\r\nthe specific gravity of the sea, to which he alludes; but these two\r\ndetermine the general result. Let us begin with the consideration of\r\nthe first of these two causes, viz.:—\r\n\r\n_Difference of Specific Gravity resulting from Difference of\r\nTemperature._—Maury explains his views on this point by means of an\r\nillustration. “Let us now suppose,” he says, “that all the water within\r\nthe tropics, to the depth of one hundred fathoms, suddenly becomes oil.\r\nThe aqueous equilibrium of the planet would thereby be disturbed, and\r\na general system of currents and counter currents would be immediately\r\ncommenced—the oil, in an unbroken sheet on the surface, running toward\r\nthe poles, and the water, in an under current, toward the equator. The\r\noil is supposed, as it reaches the polar basin, to be reconverted into\r\nwater, and the water to become oil as it crosses Cancer and Capricorn,\r\nrising to the surface in inter-tropical regions, and returning as\r\nbefore” (§ 20). “Now,” he says (§ 22), “do not the cold waters of the\r\nnorth, and the warm waters of the Gulf, made specifically lighter by\r\ntropical heat, and which we see actually preserving such a system of\r\ncounter currents, hold, at least in some degree, the relation of the\r\nsupposed water and oil?”\r\n\r\nIn § 24 he calculates that at the Narrows of Bemini the difference in\r\nweight between the volume of the Gulf-water that crosses a section of\r\nthe stream in one second, and an equal volume of water at the ocean\r\ntemperature of the latitude, supposing the two volumes to be equally\r\nsalt, is fifteen millions of pounds. Consequently the force per second\r\noperating to propel the waters of the Gulf towards the pole would in\r\nthis case, he concludes, be the “equilibrating tendency due to fifteen\r\nmillions of pounds of water in the latitude of Bemini.” In §§ 511 and\r\n512 he states that the effect of expanding the waters at the torrid\r\nzone by heat, and of contracting the waters at the frigid zone by cold,\r\nis to produce a set of surface-currents of warm and light water from\r\nthe equator towards the poles, and another set of under currents of\r\ncooler and heavy water from the poles towards the equator. (See also to\r\nthe same effect §§ 513, 514, 896.)\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that his conclusion is that the waters in\r\ninter-tropical regions are expanded by heat, while those in polar\r\nregions are contracted by cold, and that this tends to produce a\r\nsurface current from the equator to the poles, and an under current\r\nfrom the poles to the equator.\r\n\r\n“We shall now consider his second great cause of ocean currents, viz.:—\r\n\r\n_Difference of Specific Gravity resulting from Difference in Degree of\r\nSaltness._—Maury maintains, and that correctly, that saltness increases\r\nthe density of water—that, other things being equal, the saltest water\r\nis the densest. He suggests “that one of the purposes which, in the\r\ngrand design, it was probably intended to accomplish by having the sea\r\nsalt and not fresh, was to impart to its waters the forces and powers\r\nnecessary to make their circulation complete” (§ 495).\r\n\r\nNow it is perfectly obvious that if difference in saltness is to\r\nco-operate with difference in temperature in the production of\r\nocean-currents, the saltest waters, and consequently the densest, must\r\nbe in the polar regions, and the waters least salt, and consequently\r\nlightest, must be in equatorial and inter-tropical regions. Were the\r\nsaltest waters at the equator, and the freshest at the poles, it would\r\ntend to neutralize the effect due to heat, and, instead of producing\r\na current, would simply tend to prevent the existence of the currents\r\nwhich otherwise would result from difference of temperature.\r\n\r\nA very considerable portion of his work, however, is devoted to proving\r\nthat the waters of equatorial and inter-tropical regions are salter\r\nand heavier than those of the polar regions; and yet, notwithstanding\r\nthis, he endeavours to show that this difference in respect to saltness\r\nbetween the waters of the equatorial and the polar regions is one of\r\nthe chief causes, if not the chief cause, of ocean-currents. In fact,\r\nit is for this special end that so much labour is bestowed in proving\r\nthat the saltest water is in the equatorial and inter-tropical regions,\r\nand the freshest in the polar.\r\n\r\n“In the present state of our knowledge,” he says, “concerning this\r\nwonderful phenomenon (for the Gulf-stream is one of the most marvellous\r\nthings in the ocean) we can do little more than conjecture. But we have\r\ntwo causes in operation which we may safely assume are among those\r\nconcerned in producing the Gulf-stream. One of these is the increased\r\nsaltness of its water after the trade-winds have been supplied with\r\nvapour from it, be it much or little; and the other is the diminished\r\nquantum of salt which the Baltic and the Northern Seas contain” (§ 37).\r\n“Now here we have, on one side, the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico,\r\nwith their waters of brine; on the other, the great Polar Basin, the\r\nBaltic, and the North Sea, the two latter with waters that are but\r\nlittle more than brackish. In one set of these sea-basins the water is\r\nheavy, in the other it is light. Between them the ocean intervenes; but\r\nwater is bound to seek and to maintain its level; and here, therefore,\r\nwe unmask one of the agents concerned in causing the Gulf-stream” (§\r\n38). To the same effect see §§ 52, 522, 523, 524, 525, 526, 528, 530,\r\n554, 556.\r\n\r\nLieut. Maury’s _two causes neutralize each other_. Here we have two\r\ntheories put forth regarding the cause of ocean-currents, the one\r\nin direct opposition to the other. According to the one theory,\r\nocean-currents exist because the waters of equatorial regions, in\r\nconsequence of their higher temperature, are _less dense_ than the\r\nwaters of the polar regions; but according to the other theory,\r\nocean-currents exist because the waters of equatorial regions, in\r\nconsequence of their greater saltness, are _more dense_ than the\r\nwaters of the polar regions. If the one cause be assigned as a reason\r\nwhy ocean-currents exist, then the other can be equally assigned as\r\na reason why they should not exist. According to both theories it is\r\nthe difference of density between the equatorial and polar waters that\r\ngives rise to currents; but while the one theory maintains that the\r\nequatorial waters are _lighter_ than the polar, the other holds that\r\nthey are _heavier_. Either the one theory or the other may be true,\r\nor neither; but it is logically impossible that both of them can. Let\r\nit be observed that it is not two currents, the one contrary to the\r\nother, with which we have at present to do; it is not temperature\r\nproducing currents in one direction, and saltness producing currents\r\nin the contrary direction. We have two theories regarding the origin\r\nof currents, the one diametrically opposed to the other. The tendency\r\nof the one cause assigned is to prevent the action of the other. If\r\ntemperature is allowed to act, it will make the inter-tropical waters\r\nlighter than the polar, and then, according to theory, a current will\r\nresult. But if we bring saltness into play (the other cause) it will\r\ndo the reverse: it will increase the density of the inter-tropical\r\nwaters and diminish the density of the polar; and so far as it acts it\r\nwill diminish the currents produced by temperature, because it will\r\ndiminish the difference of specific gravity between the inter-tropical\r\nand polar regions which had been previously caused by temperature. And\r\nwhen the effects of saltness are as powerful as those of temperature,\r\nthe difference of specific gravity produced by temperature will be\r\ncompletely effaced, or, in other words, the waters of the equatorial\r\nand polar seas will be of the same density, and consequently no current\r\nwill exist. And so long as the two causes continue in action, no\r\ncurrent can arise, unless the energy of the one cause should happen to\r\nexceed that of the other; and even then a current will only exist to\r\nthe extent by which the strength of the one exceeds that of the other.\r\n\r\nThe contrary nature of the two theories will be better seen by\r\nconsidering the way in which it is supposed that difference in saltness\r\nis produced and acts as a cause.\r\n\r\nIf there is a constant current resulting from the difference in\r\nsaltness between the equatorial and polar waters, then there must be a\r\ncause which maintains this difference. The current is simply the effort\r\nto restore the equilibrium lost by the difference; and the current\r\nwould very soon do this, and then all motion would cease, were there\r\nnot a constantly operating cause maintaining the disturbance. What,\r\nthen, according to Maury, is the cause of this disturbance, or, in\r\nother words, what is it that keeps the equatorial waters salter than\r\nthe polar?\r\n\r\nThe agencies in operation are stated by him to be heat, radiation,\r\nevaporation, precipitation, and secretion of solid matter in the form\r\nof shells, &c. The two most important, however, are evaporation and\r\nprecipitation.\r\n\r\nThe trade-winds enter the equatorial regions as relatively dry winds\r\nthirsting for vapour; consequently they absorb far more moisture than\r\nthey give out; and the result is that in inter-tropical regions,\r\nevaporation is much in excess of precipitation; and as fresh water only\r\nis taken up, the salt being left behind, the process, of course, tends\r\nto increase the saltness of the inter-tropical seas. Again, in polar\r\nand extra-tropical regions the reverse is the case; precipitation is in\r\nexcess of evaporation. This tends in turn to diminish the saltness of\r\nthe waters of those regions. (See on these points §§ 31, 33, 34, 37,\r\n179, 517, 526, and 552.)\r\n\r\nIn the system of circulation produced by difference of temperature,\r\nas we have already seen, the surface-currents flow from the equator\r\nto the poles, and the under or return currents from the poles to the\r\nequator; but in the system produced by difference of saltness, the\r\nsurface currents flow from the poles to the equator, and the return\r\nunder currents from the equator to the poles. That the surface currents\r\nproduced by difference of saltness flow from the poles to the equator,\r\nMaury thinks is evident for the two following reasons:—\r\n\r\n(1) As evaporation is in excess of precipitation in inter-tropical\r\nregions, more water is taken off the surface of the ocean in those\r\nregions than falls upon it in the form of rain. This excess of water\r\nfalls in the form of rain on temperate and polar regions, where,\r\nconsequently, precipitation is in excess of evaporation. The lifting\r\nof the water off the equatorial regions and its deposit on the polar\r\ntend to lower the level of the ocean in equatorial regions and to raise\r\nthe level in polar; consequently, in order to restore the level of\r\nthe ocean, the surface water at the polar regions flows towards the\r\nequatorial regions.\r\n\r\n(2) As the water taken up at the equator is fresh, and the salt\r\nis left behind, the ocean, in inter-tropical regions, is thus made\r\nsaltier and consequently denser. This dense water, therefore, sinks\r\nand passes away as an under current. This water, evaporated from\r\ninter-tropical regions, falls as fresh and lighter water in temperate\r\nand polar regions; and therefore not only is the level of the ocean\r\nraised, but the waters are made lighter. Hence, in order to restore\r\nequilibrium, the waters in temperate and polar regions will flow as\r\na surface current towards the equator. Under currents will flow from\r\nthe equator to the poles, and surface or upper currents from the poles\r\nto the equator. Difference in temperature and difference in saltness,\r\ntherefore, in every respect tend to produce opposite effects.\r\n\r\nThat the above is a fair representation of the way in which Maury\r\nsupposes difference in saltness to act as a cause in the production of\r\nocean-currents will appear from the following quotations:—\r\n\r\n“In those regions, as in the trade-wind region, where evaporation is\r\nin excess of precipitation, the general level of this supposed sea\r\nwould be altered, and immediately as much water as is carried off by\r\nevaporation would commence to flow in from north and south toward the\r\ntrade-wind or evaporation region, to restore the level” (§ 509). “On\r\nthe other hand, the winds have taken this vapour, borne it off to the\r\nextra-tropical regions, and precipitated it, we will suppose, where\r\nprecipitation is in excess of evaporation. Here is another alteration\r\nof sea-level, by elevation instead of by depression; and hence we\r\nhave the motive power for a _surface current from each pole towards\r\nthe equator_, the object of which is only to supply the demand for\r\nevaporation in the trade-wind regions” (§ 510).\r\n\r\nThe above result would follow, supposing the ocean to be fresh. He then\r\nproceeds to consider an additional result that follows in consequence\r\nof the saltness of the ocean.\r\n\r\n“Let evaporation now commence in the trade-wind region, as it was\r\nsupposed to do in the case of the freshwater seas, and as it actually\r\ngoes on in nature—and what takes place? Why a lowering of the sea-level\r\nas before. But as the vapour of salt water is fresh, or nearly so,\r\nfresh water only is taken up from the ocean; that which remains behind\r\nis therefore more salt. Thus, while the level is lowered in the salt\r\nsea, the equilibrium is destroyed because of the saltness of the water;\r\nfor the water that remains after evaporation takes place is, on account\r\nof the solid matter held in solution, specifically heavier than it was\r\nbefore any portion of it was converted into vapour” (§ 517).\r\n\r\n“The vapour is taken from the surface-water; the surface-water thereby\r\nbecomes more salt, and, under certain conditions, heavier. When it\r\nbecomes heavier, it sinks; and hence we have, due to the salts of the\r\nsea, a vertical circulation, namely, a descent of heavier—because\r\nsalter and cooler—water from the surface, and an ascent of water that\r\nis lighter—because it is not so salt—from the depths below” (§ 518).\r\n\r\nIn section 519 he goes on to show that this vapour removed from the\r\ninter-tropical region is precipitated in the polar regions, where\r\nprecipitation is in excess of evaporation. “In the precipitating\r\nregions, therefore, the level is destroyed, as before explained, by\r\nelevation, and in the evaporating regions by depression; which, as\r\nalready stated, gives rise to a system of _surface_ currents, moved by\r\ngravity alone, from the _poles towards the equator_” (§ 520).\r\n\r\n“This fresh water being emptied into the Polar Sea and agitated by the\r\nwinds, becomes mixed with the salt; but as the agitation of the sea by\r\nthe winds is supposed to extend to no great depth, it is only the upper\r\nlayer of salt water, and that to a moderate depth, which becomes mixed\r\nwith the fresh. The specific gravity of this upper layer, therefore, is\r\ndiminished just as much as the specific gravity of the sea-water in the\r\nevaporating regions was increased. _And thus we have a surface current\r\nof saltish water from the poles towards the equator, and an under\r\ncurrent of water salter and heavier from the equator to the poles_” (§\r\n522).\r\n\r\n“This property of saltness imparts to the waters of the ocean another\r\npeculiarity, by which the sea is still better adapted for the\r\nregulation of climates, and it is this: by evaporating fresh water from\r\nthe salt in the tropics, the surface water becomes heavier than the\r\naverage of sea-water. This heavy water is also warm water; it sinks,\r\nand being a good retainer, but a bad conductor, of heat, this water\r\nis employed in transporting through _under currents_ heat for the\r\nmitigation of climates in far distant regions” (§ 526).\r\n\r\n“For instance, let us suppose the waters in a certain part of the\r\ntorrid zone to be 90°, but by reason of the fresh water which has been\r\ntaken from them in a state of vapour, and consequently, by reason of\r\nthe proportionate increase of salts, these waters are heavier than\r\nwaters that may be cooler, but not so salt. This being the case, the\r\ntendency would be for this warm but salt and heavy water to flow off as\r\nan _under current towards the polar or some other regions of lighter\r\nwater_” (§ 554).\r\n\r\nThat Maury supposes the warm water at the equator to flow to the polar\r\nregions as an under current is further evident from the fact that he\r\nmaintains that the climate of the arctic regions is mitigated by a warm\r\nunder current, which comes from the equatorial regions, and passes up\r\nthrough Davis Straits (see §§ 534−544).\r\n\r\nThe question now suggests itself: to which of these two antagonistic\r\ncauses does Maury really suppose ocean-currents must be referred?\r\nWhether does he suppose, difference in temperature or difference in\r\nsaltness, to be the real cause? I have been unable to find anything\r\nfrom which we can reasonably conclude that he prefers the one cause\r\nto the other. It would seem that he regards both as real causes, and\r\nthat he has failed to perceive that the one is destructive of the\r\nother. But it is difficult to conceive how he could believe that the\r\nsea in equatorial regions, by virtue of its higher temperature, is\r\nlighter than the sea in polar regions, while at the same time it _is\r\nnot_ lighter but heavier, in consequence of its greater saltness—how\r\nhe could believe that the warm water at the equator flows to the poles\r\nas an upper current, and the cold water at the poles to the equator\r\nas an _under_ current, while at the same time the warm water at the\r\nequator does not flow to the poles as a surface current, nor the cold\r\nwater at the poles to the equator as an under current, but the reverse.\r\nAnd yet, unless these absolute impossibilities be possible, how can an\r\nocean-current be the result of both causes?\r\n\r\nThe only explanation of the matter appears to be that Maury has failed\r\nto perceive the contradictory nature of his two theories. This fact is\r\nparticularly seen when he comes to apply his two theories to the case\r\nof the Gulf-stream. He maintains, as has already been stated, that\r\nthe waters of the Gulf-stream are salter than the waters of the sea\r\nthrough which they flow (see §§ 3, 28, 29, 30, 34, and several other\r\nplaces). And he states, as we have already seen (see p. 104), that the\r\nexistence of the Gulf-stream is due principally to the difference of\r\ndensity of the water of the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico as\r\ncompared with that of the great Polar Basin and the North Sea. There\r\ncan be no doubt whatever that it is the _density_ of the waters of the\r\nGulf-stream at its fountain-head, the Gulf of Mexico, resulting from\r\nits superior saltness, and the deficiency of density of the waters in\r\npolar regions and the North Sea, &c., that is here considered to be\r\nunmasked as one of the agents. If this be a cause of the motion of the\r\nGulf-stream, how then can the difference of temperature between the\r\nwaters of inter-tropical and polar regions assist as a cause? This\r\ndifference of temperature will simply tend to undo all that has been\r\ndone by difference of saltness: for it will tend to make the waters\r\nof the Gulf of Mexico lighter, and the waters of the polar regions\r\nheavier. But Maury maintains, as we have seen, that this difference of\r\ntemperature is also a cause, which shows that he does not perceive the\r\ncontradiction.\r\n\r\nThis is still further apparent. He holds, as stated, that “the waters\r\nof the Gulf-stream are salter than the waters of the sea through which\r\nthey flow,” and that this excess in saltness, by making the water\r\nheavier, is a cause of the motion of the stream. But he maintains that,\r\nnotwithstanding the effect which greater saltness has in increasing\r\nthe density of the waters of the Gulf-stream, yet, owing to their\r\nhigher temperature, they are actually lighter than the water through\r\nwhich they flow; and as a proof that this is the case, he adduces the\r\nfact that the surface of the Gulf-stream is roof-shaped (§§ 39−41),\r\nwhich it could not be were its waters not actually lighter than the\r\nwaters through which the stream flows. So it turns out that, in\r\ncontradiction to what he had already stated, it is the lesser density\r\nof the waters of the Gulf-stream that is the real cause of their\r\nmotion. The greater saltness of the waters, to which he attributes so\r\nmuch, can in no way be regarded as a cause of motion. Its effect, so\r\nfar as it goes, is to stop the motion of the stream rather than to\r\nassist it.\r\n\r\nBut, again, although he asserts that difference of saltness and\r\ndifference of temperature are both causes of ocean-currents, yet he\r\nappears actually to admit that temperature and saltness neutralize each\r\nother so as to prevent change in the specific gravity of the ocean, as\r\nwill be seen from the following quotation:—\r\n\r\n“It is the trade-winds, then, which prevent the thermal and specific\r\ngravity curves from conforming with each other in inter-tropical seas.\r\nThe water they suck up is fresh water; and the salt it contained, being\r\nleft behind, is just sufficient to counterbalance, by its weight, the\r\neffect of thermal dilatation upon the specific gravity of sea-water\r\nbetween the parallels of 34° north and south. As we go from 34° to the\r\nequator, the water grows warmer and expands. It would become lighter;\r\nbut the trade-winds, by taking up vapour without salt, make the water\r\nsalter, and therefore heavier. The conclusion is, the proportion of\r\nsalt in sea-water, its expansibility between 62° and 82°, and the\r\nthirst of the trade-winds for vapour are, where they blow, so balanced\r\nas to produce _perfect compensation_; and a more beautiful compensation\r\ncannot, it appears to me, be found in the mechanism of the universe\r\nthan that which we have here stumbled upon. It is a triple adjustment;\r\nthe power of the sun to expand, the power of the winds to evaporate,\r\nand the quantity of salts in the sea—these are so proportioned and\r\nadjusted that when both the wind and the sun have each played with\r\nits forces upon the inter-tropical waters of the ocean, _the residuum\r\nof heat and of salt should be just such as to balance each other in\r\ntheir effects; and so the aqueous equilibrium of the torrid zone is\r\npreserved_” (§ 436, eleventh edition).\r\n\r\n“Between 35° or 40° and the equator evaporation is in excess of\r\nprecipitation; and though, as we approach the equator on either side\r\nfrom these parallels, the solar ray warms and expands the surface-water\r\nof the sea, the winds, by the vapour they carry off, and the salt they\r\nleave behind, _prevent it from making that water lighter_” (§ 437,\r\neleventh edition).\r\n\r\n“Philosophers have admired the relations between the size of the earth,\r\nthe force of gravity, and the strength of fibre in the flower-stalks of\r\nplants; but how much more exquisite is the system of counterpoises and\r\nadjustments here presented between the sea and its salts, the winds and\r\nthe heat of the sun!” (§ 438, eleventh edition).\r\n\r\nHow can this be reconciled with all that precedes regarding\r\nocean-currents being the result of difference of specific gravity\r\ncaused by a difference of temperature and difference of saltness? Here\r\nis a distinct recognition of the fact that difference in saltness,\r\ninstead of producing currents, tends rather to prevent the existence of\r\ncurrents, by counteracting the effects of difference in temperature.\r\nAnd so effectually does it do this, that for 40°, or nearly 3,000\r\nmiles, on each side of the equator there is absolutely no difference in\r\nthe specific gravity of the ocean, and consequently nothing, either as\r\nregards difference of temperature or difference of saltness, that can\r\npossibly give rise to a current.\r\n\r\nBut it is evident that, if between the equator and latitude 40° the\r\ntwo effects completely neutralize each other, it is not at all likely\r\nthat between latitude 40° and the poles they will not to a large extent\r\ndo the same thing. And if so, how can ocean-currents be due either\r\nto difference in temperature or to difference in saltness, far less\r\nto both. If there be any difference of specific gravity of the ocean\r\nbetween latitude 40° and the poles, it must be only to the extent\r\nby which the one cause has failed to neutralize the other. If, for\r\nexample, the waters in latitude 40°, by virtue of higher temperature,\r\nare less dense than the waters in the polar regions, they can be so\r\nonly to the extent that difference in saltness has failed to neutralize\r\nthe effect of difference in temperature. And if currents result, they\r\ncan do so only to the extent that difference in saltness has thus\r\nfallen short of being able to produce complete compensation. Maury,\r\nafter stating his views on compensation, seems to become aware of\r\nthis; but, strangely, he does not appear to perceive, or, at least, he\r\ndoes not make any allusion to the fact, that all this is fatal to his\r\ntheories about ocean-currents being the combined result of differences\r\nof temperature and of saltness. For, in opposition to all that he\r\nhad previously advanced regarding the difficulty of finding a cause\r\nsufficiently powerful to account for such currents as the Gulf-stream,\r\nand the great importance that difference in saltness had in their\r\nproduction, he now begins to maintain that so great is the influence\r\nof difference in temperature that difference in saltness, and a number\r\nof other compensating causes are actually necessary to prevent the\r\nocean-currents from becoming too powerful.\r\n\r\n“If all the inter-tropical heat of the sun,” he says, “were to pass\r\ninto the seas upon which it falls, simply raising the temperature of\r\ntheir waters, it would create a thermo-dynamical force in the ocean\r\ncapable of transporting water scalding hot from the torrid zone, and\r\nspreading it while still in the tepid state around the poles.... Now,\r\nsuppose there were no trade-winds to evaporate and to counteract the\r\ndynamical force of the sun, this hot and light water, by becoming\r\nhotter and lighter, would flow off in currents with almost mill-tail\r\nvelocity towards the poles, covering the intervening sea with a mantle\r\nof warmth as a garment. The cool and heavy water of the polar basin,\r\ncoming out as under currents, would flow equatorially with equal\r\nvelocity.”\r\n\r\n“Thus two antagonistic forces are unmasked, and, being unmasked, we\r\ndiscover in them a most exquisite adjustment—a compensation—by which\r\nthe dynamical forces that reside in the sunbeam and the trade-wind\r\nare made to counterbalance each other, by which the climates of\r\ninter-tropical seas are regulated, and by which the set, force, and\r\nvolume of oceanic currents are measured” (§§ 437 and 438, eleventh\r\nedition).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n           EXAMINATION OF THE GRAVITATION THEORY OF OCEANIC\r\n           CIRCULATION.—LIEUT. MAURY’S THEORY (_continued_).\r\n\r\n  Methods of determining the Question.—The Force resulting from\r\n      Difference of Specific Gravity.—Sir John Herschel’s Estimate\r\n      of the Force.—Maximum Density of Sea-Water.—Rate of Decrease\r\n      of Temperature of Ocean at Equator.—-The actual Amount of\r\n      Force resulting from Difference of Specific Gravity.—M.\r\n      Dubuat’s Experiments.\r\n\r\n\r\n_How the Question may be Determined._—Whether the circulation of the\r\nocean is due to difference in specific gravity or not may be determined\r\nin three ways: viz. (1) by direct experiment; (2) by ascertaining the\r\nabsolute amount of _force_ acting on the water to produce motion, in\r\nvirtue of difference of specific gravity, and thereafter comparing it\r\nwith the force which has been shown by experiment to be necessary to\r\nthe production of sensible motion; or (3) by determining the greatest\r\npossible amount of _work_ which gravity can perform on the waters in\r\nvirtue of difference of specific gravity, and then ascertaining if the\r\nwork of gravity does or does not equal the work of the resistances in\r\nthe required motion. But Maury has not adopted either of these methods.\r\n\r\n_The Force resulting from Difference of Specific Gravity._—I shall\r\nconsider first whether the force resulting from difference of specific\r\ngravity be sufficient to account for the motion of ocean-currents.\r\n\r\nThe inadequacy of this cause has been so clearly shown by Sir John\r\nHerschel, that one might expect that little else would be required than\r\nsimply to quote his words on the subject, which are as follows:—\r\n\r\n“First, then, if there were no atmosphere, there would be no\r\nGulf-stream, or any other considerable ocean-current (as distinguished\r\nfrom a mere surface-drift) whatever. By the action of the sun’s rays,\r\nthe _surface_ of the ocean becomes _most_ heated, and the heated water\r\nwill, therefore, neither directly tend to _ascend_ (which it could\r\nnot do without leaving the sea) nor to _descend_, which it cannot do,\r\nbeing rendered buoyant, nor to move laterally, no lateral impulse being\r\ngiven, and which it could only do by reason of a general declivity\r\nof surface, the dilated portion occupying a higher level. Let us see\r\nwhat this declivity would amount to. The equatorial surface-water\r\nhas a temperature of 84°. At 7,200 feet deep the temperature is 39°,\r\nthe level of which temperature rises to the surface in latitude 56°.\r\nTaking the dilatability of sea-water to be the same as that of fresh, a\r\nuniformly progressive increase of temperature, from 39° to 84° Fahr.,\r\nwould dilate a column of 7,200 feet by 10 feet, to which height,\r\ntherefore, above the spheroid of equilibrium (or above the sea-level in\r\nlat. 56°), the equatorial surface is actually raised by dilatation. An\r\narc of 56° on the earth’s surface measures 3,360 geographical miles;\r\nso that we have a slope of 1/28th of an inch per geographical mile, or\r\n1/32nd of an inch per statute mile for the water so raised to run down.\r\nAs the accelerating force corresponding to such a slope (of 1/10th of\r\na second, 0″·1) is less than one two-millionth part of gravity, we\r\nmay dismiss this as a cause capable of creating only a very trifling\r\nsurface-drift, and not worth considering, even were it in the proper\r\ndirection to form, by concentration, a current from east to west,\r\n_which it could not be, but the very reverse_.”[55]\r\n\r\nIt is singular how any one, even though he regarded this conclusion as\r\nbut a rough approximation to the truth, could entertain the idea that\r\nocean-currents can be the result of difference in specific gravity.\r\nThere are one or two reasons, however, which may be given for the\r\nabove not having been generally received as conclusive. Herschel’s\r\ncalculations refer to the difference of gravity resulting from\r\ndifference of temperature; but this is only one of the causes to which\r\nMaury appeals, and even not the one to which he most frequently refers.\r\nHe insists so strongly on the effects of difference of saltness, that\r\nmany might think that, although Herschel may have shown that difference\r\nin specific gravity arising from difference of temperature could not\r\naccount for the motion of ocean-currents, yet nevertheless that this,\r\ncombined with the effects resulting from difference in saltness, might\r\nbe a sufficient explanation of the phenomena. Such, of course, would\r\nnot be the case with those who perceived the contradictory nature of\r\nMaury’s two causes; but probably many read the “Physical Geography of\r\nthe Sea” without being aware that the one cause is destructive of the\r\nother. Again, a few plausible objections, which have never received due\r\nconsideration, have been strongly urged by Maury and others against the\r\ntheory that ocean-currents can be caused by the impulses of the winds;\r\nand probably these objections appear to militate as strongly against\r\nthis theory as Herschel’s arguments against Maury’s.\r\n\r\nThere is one trifling objection to Herschel’s result: he takes 39° as\r\nthe temperature of maximum density. This, however, as we shall see,\r\ndoes not materially affect his conclusions.\r\n\r\nObservations on the temperature of the maximum density of sea-water\r\nhave been made by Erman, Despretz, Rossetti, Neumann, Marcet, Hubbard,\r\nHorner, and others. No two of them have arrived at exactly the same\r\nconclusion. This probably arises from the fact that the temperature\r\nof maximum density depends upon the amount of salt held in solution.\r\nNo two seas, unless they are equal as to saltness, have the same\r\ntemperature of maximum density. The following Table of Despretz will\r\nshow how rapidly the temperature of both the freezing-point and of\r\nmaximum density is lowered by additional amounts of salt:—\r\n\r\n  +-----------+-----------------+------------------+\r\n  |  Amount   | Temperature of  | Temperature of   |\r\n  | of salt.  | freezing-point. | Maximum density. |\r\n  +-----------+-----------------+------------------+\r\n  |           |     °           |      °           |\r\n  | 0·000123  |    −1·21 C.     |    + 1·19 C.     |\r\n  | 0·0246    |    −2·24        |    − 1·69        |\r\n  | 0·0371    |    −2·77        |    − 4·75        |\r\n  | 0·0741    |    −5·28        |    −16·00        |\r\n  +-----------+-----------------+------------------+\r\n\r\nHe found the temperature of maximum density of sea-water, whose density\r\nat 20°C. was 1·0273, to be −3°·67C. (25°·4F.), and the temperature of\r\nfreezing-point −2°·55C. (27°·4F.).[56] Somewhere between 25° and 26°\r\nF. may therefore be regarded as the temperature of maximum density\r\nof sea-water of average saltness. We have no reason to believe that\r\nthe ocean, from the surface to the bottom, even at the poles, is at\r\n27°·4F., the freezing-point.\r\n\r\nThe actual slope resulting from difference of specific gravity,\r\nas we shall presently see, does not amount to 10 feet. Herschel’s\r\nestimate was, however, made on insufficient data, both as to the rate\r\nof expansion of sea-water and that at which the temperature of the\r\nocean at the equator decreases from the surface downwards. We are\r\nhappily now in the possession of data for determining with tolerable\r\naccuracy the amount of slope due to difference of temperature between\r\nthe equatorial and polar seas. The rate of expansion of sea-water\r\nfrom 0°C. to 100°C. has been experimentally determined by Professor\r\nMuncke, of Heidelberg.[57] The valuable reports of Captain Nares, of\r\nH.M.S. _Challenger_, lately published by the Admiralty, give the rate\r\nat which the temperature of the Atlantic at the equator decreases\r\nfrom the surface downwards. These observations show clearly that the\r\nsuper-heating effect of the sun’s rays does not extend to any great\r\ndepth. They also prove that at the equator the temperature decreases\r\nas the depth increases so rapidly that at 60 fathoms from the surface\r\nthe temperature is 62°·4, the same as at Madeira at the same depth;\r\nwhile at the depth of 150 fathoms it is only 51°, about the same as\r\nthat in the Bay of Biscay (Reports, p. 11). Here at the very outset\r\nwe have broad and important facts hostile to the theory of a flow of\r\nwater resulting from difference of temperature between the ocean in\r\nequatorial and temperate and polar regions.\r\n\r\nThrough the kindness of Staff-Captain Evans, Hydrographer of the\r\nAdmiralty, I have been favoured with a most valuable set of serial\r\ntemperature soundings made by Captain Nares of the _Challenger_, close\r\nto the equator, between long. 14° 49′ W. and 32° 16′ W. The following\r\nTable represents the mean of the whole of these observations:—\r\n\r\n  +----------+-------------+\r\n  | Fathoms. | Temperature.|\r\n  +----------+-------------+\r\n  |          |       °     |\r\n  | Surface. |     77·9    |\r\n  |    10    |     77·2    |\r\n  |    20    |     77·1    |\r\n  |    30    |     76·9    |\r\n  |    40    |     71·7    |\r\n  |    50    |     64·0    |\r\n  |    60    |     60·4    |\r\n  |    70    |     59·4    |\r\n  |    80    |     58·0    |\r\n  |    90    |     58·0    |\r\n  |   100    |     55·6    |\r\n  |   150    |     51·0    |\r\n  |   200    |     46·6    |\r\n  |   300    |     42·2    |\r\n  |   400    |     40·3    |\r\n  |   500    |     38·9    |\r\n  |   600    |     39·2    |\r\n  |   700    |     39·0    |\r\n  |   800    |     39·1    |\r\n  |   900    |     38·2    |\r\n  |  1000    |     36·9    |\r\n  |  1100    |     37·6    |\r\n  |  1200    |     36·7    |\r\n  |  1300    |     35·8    |\r\n  |  1400    |     36·4    |\r\n  |  1500    |     36·1    |\r\n  | Bottom.  |     34·7    |\r\n  +----------+-------------+\r\n\r\nWe have in this Table data for determining the height at which the\r\nsurface of the ocean at the equator ought to stand above that of the\r\npoles. Assuming 32°F. to be the temperature of the ocean at the poles\r\nfrom the surface to the bottom and the foregoing to be the rate at\r\nwhich the temperature of the ocean at the equator decreases from the\r\nsurface downwards, and then calculating according to Muncke’s Table of\r\nthe expansion of sea-water, we have only 4 feet 6 inches as the height\r\nto which the level of the ocean at the equator ought to stand above\r\nthat at the poles in order that the ocean may be in static equilibrium.\r\nIn other words, the equatorial column requires to be only 4 feet 6\r\ninches higher than the polar in order that the two may balance each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nTaking the distance from the equator to the poles at 6,200 miles, the\r\nforce resulting from the slope of 4½ feet in 6,200 will amount to only\r\n1/7,340,000th that of gravity, or about 1/1000th of a grain on a pound\r\nof water. But, as we shall shortly see, there can be no permanent\r\ncurrent resulting from difference of temperature while the two columns\r\nremain in equilibrium, for the current is simply an effort to the\r\nretardation of equilibrium. In order to have permanent circulation\r\nthere must be a permanent disturbance of equilibrium. Or, in other\r\nwords, the weight of the polar column must be kept in excess of that\r\nof the equatorial. Suppose, then, that the weight of the polar column\r\nexceeds that of the equatorial by 2 feet of water, the difference of\r\nlevel between the two columns will, in that case, amount to only 2\r\nfeet 6 inches. This would give a force of only 1/13,200,000th that of\r\ngravity, or not much over 1/1,900th of a grain on a pound of water,\r\ntending to draw the water down the slope from the equator to the poles,\r\na force which does not much exceed the weight of a grain on a ton of\r\nwater. But it must be observed that this force of a grain per ton would\r\naffect only the water at the surface; a very short distance below the\r\nsurface the force, small as it is, would be enormously reduced. If\r\nwater were a perfect fluid, and offered no resistance to motion, it\r\nwould not only flow down an incline, however small it might be, but\r\nwould flow down with an accelerated motion. But water is not a perfect\r\nfluid, and its molecules do offer considerable resistance to motion.\r\nWater flowing down an incline, however steep it may be, soon acquires\r\na uniform motion. There must therefore be a certain inclination below\r\nwhich no motion can take place. Experiments were made by M. Dubuat\r\nwith the view of determining this limit.[58] He found that when the\r\ninclination was 1 in 500,000, the motion of the water was barely\r\nperceptible; and he came to the conclusion that when the inclination\r\nis reduced to 1 in 1,000,000, all motion ceases. But the inclination\r\nafforded by the difference of temperature between the sea in equatorial\r\nand polar regions does not amount to one-seventh of this, and\r\nconsequently it can hardly produce even that “trifling surface-drift”\r\nwhich Sir John Herschel is willing to attribute to it.\r\n\r\nThere is an error into which some writers appear to fall to which I\r\nmay here refer. Suppose that at the equator we have to descend 10,000\r\nfeet before water equal in density to that at the poles is reached. We\r\nhave in this case a plain with a slope of 10,000 feet in 6,200 miles,\r\nforming the upper surface of the water of maximum density. Now this\r\nslope exercises no influence in the way of producing a current, as some\r\nseem to think; for it is not a case of disturbed equilibrium, but the\r\nreverse. It is the condition of static equilibrium resulting from a\r\ndifference between the temperature of the water at the equator and the\r\npoles. The only slope that has any tendency to produce motion is that\r\nwhich is formed by the surface of the ocean in the equatorial regions\r\nbeing higher than the surface at the poles; but this is an inclination\r\nof only 4 feet 6 inches, and is therefore wholly inadequate to produce\r\nsuch currents as the Gulf-stream.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n           EXAMINATION OF THE GRAVITATION THEORY OF OCEANIC\r\n                 CIRCULATION.—DR.

Maury, that the difference\r\nof temperature between the ocean in equatorial and polar regions can\r\naccount for the Gulf-stream and other great currents of the ocean.\r\nHe maintains, however, that this difference is quite sufficient to\r\nbring about a slow general interchange of water between the polar and\r\ninter-tropical areas—to induce a general movement of the upper portion\r\nof the ocean from the equator to the poles and a counter-movement of\r\nthe under portion in a contrary direction. It is this general movement\r\nwhich, according to that author, is the great agent by which heat is\r\ndistributed over the globe.[59]\r\n\r\nIn attempting to estimate the adequacy of this hypothesis as an\r\nexplanation of the phenomena involved, there are obviously two\r\nquestions to be considered: namely, (1) is the difference of\r\ntemperature between the sea in inter-tropical and polar regions\r\nsufficiently great to produce the required movement? and (2) assuming\r\nthat there is such a movement, does it convey the amount of heat which\r\nDr. Carpenter supposes? I shall begin with the consideration of the\r\nfirst of these two points.\r\n\r\nBut before doing so let us see what the facts are which this\r\ngravitation theory is intended to explain.\r\n\r\n_The Facts to be Explained._—Dr. Carpenter considers that the great\r\nmass of warm water proved during recent dredging expeditions to\r\noccupy the depths of the North Atlantic, must be referred, not to the\r\nGulf-stream, but to a general movement of water from the equator. “The\r\ninference seems inevitable,” he says, “that the bulk of the water in\r\nthe warm area must have come thither from the south-west. The influence\r\nof the Gulf-stream proper (meaning by this the body of super-heated\r\nwater which issues through the ‘Narrows’ from the Gulf of Mexico), if\r\nit reaches this locality at all (which is very doubtful), could only\r\naffect the _most superficial_ stratum; and the same may be said of\r\nthe surface-drift caused by the prevalence of south-westerly winds,\r\nto which some have attributed the phenomena usually accounted for by\r\nthe extension of the Gulf-stream to these regions. And the presence\r\nof the body of water which lies between 100 and 600 fathoms deep, and\r\nthe range of whose temperature is from 48° to 42°, can scarcely be\r\naccounted for on any other hypothesis than that of a _great general\r\nmovement of equatorial water towards the polar area_, of which\r\nmovement the Gulf-stream constitutes a peculiar case modified by local\r\nconditions. In like manner the Arctic stream which underlies the warm\r\nsuperficial stratum in our cold area constitutes a peculiar case,\r\nmodified by the local conditions to be presently explained, of _a great\r\ngeneral movement of polar water towards the equatorial area_, which\r\ndepresses the temperature of the deepest parts of the great oceanic\r\nbasins nearly to the freezing-point.”\r\n\r\nIt is well-known that, wherever temperature-observations have been\r\nmade in the Atlantic, the bottom of that ocean has been found to be\r\noccupied by water of an ice-cold temperature. And this holds true\r\nnot merely of the Atlantic, but also of the ocean in inter-tropical\r\nregions—a fact which has been proved by repeated observations, and more\r\nparticularly of late by those of Commander Chimmo in the China Sea and\r\nIndian Ocean, where a temperature as low as 32° Fahr. was found at a\r\ndepth of 2,656 fathoms. In short, the North Atlantic, and probably the\r\ninter-tropical seas also, may be regarded, Dr. Carpenter considers, as\r\ndivided horizontally into two great layers or strata—an upper warm, and\r\na lower cold stratum. All these facts I, of course, freely admit; nor\r\nam I aware that their truth has been called in question by any one, no\r\nmatter what his views may have been as to the mode in which they are to\r\nbe explained.\r\n\r\n_The Explanation of the Facts._—We have next the explanation of the\r\nfacts, which is simply this:—The cold water occupying the bottom of\r\nthe Atlantic and of inter-tropical seas is to be accounted for by the\r\nsupposition that _it came from the polar regions_. This is obvious,\r\nbecause the cold possessed by the water could not have been derived\r\nfrom the crust of the earth beneath: neither could it have come from\r\nthe surface; for the temperature of the bottom water is far below the\r\nnormal temperature of the latitude in which it is found. Consequently\r\n“the inference seems irresistible that this depression must be produced\r\nand maintained by the convection of cold from the polar towards the\r\nequatorial area.” Of course, if we suppose a flow of water from the\r\npoles towards the equator, we must necessarily infer a counter flow\r\nfrom the equator towards the poles; and while the water flowing from\r\nequatorial to polar regions will be _warm_, that flowing from polar to\r\nequatorial regions will be _cold_. The doctrine of a mutual interchange\r\nof equatorial and polar water is therefore a _necessary consequence_\r\nfrom the admission of the foregoing facts. With this _explanation\r\nof the facts_ I need hardly say that I fully agree; nor am I aware\r\nthat its correctness has ever been disputed. Dr. Carpenter surely\r\ncannot charge me with overlooking the fact of a mutual interchange of\r\nequatorial and polar water, seeing that my estimate of the thermal\r\npower of the Gulf-stream, from which it is proved that the amount\r\nof heat conveyed from equatorial to temperate and polar regions\r\nis enormously greater than had ever been anticipated, was made a\r\nconsiderable time before he began to write on the subject of oceanic\r\ncirculation.[60] And in my paper “On Ocean-currents in relation to the\r\nDistribution of Heat over the Globe”[61] (the substance of which is\r\nreproduced in Chapters II. and III. of this volume), I have endeavoured\r\nto show that, were it not for the raising of the temperature of polar\r\nand high temperate regions and the lowering of the temperature of\r\ninter-tropical regions by means of this interchange of water, these\r\nportions of the globe would not be habitable by the present existing\r\norders of beings.\r\n\r\nThe explanation goes further:—“It is along the surface and upper\r\nportion of the ocean that the equatorial waters flow towards the\r\npoles, and it is along the bottom and under portion of the ocean that\r\npolar waters flow towards the equator; or, in other words, the warm\r\nwater keeps the _upper_ portion of the ocean and the cold water the\r\n_under_ portion.” With this explanation I to a great extent agree. It\r\nis evident that, in reference to the northern hemisphere at least, the\r\nmost of the water which flows from inter-tropical to polar regions\r\n(as, for example, the Gulf-stream) keeps to the surface and upper\r\nportion of the ocean; but for reasons which I have already stated, a\r\nvery large proportion of this water must return in the form of _under_\r\ncurrents; or, which is the same thing, the return compensating current,\r\nwhether it consist of the identical water which originally came from\r\nthe equator or not, must flow towards the equator as an under current.\r\nThat the cold water which is found at the bottom of the Atlantic and\r\nof inter-tropical seas must have come as under currents is perfectly\r\nobvious, because water which should come along the surface of the ocean\r\nfrom the polar regions would not be cold when it reached inter-tropical\r\nregions.\r\n\r\n_The Explanation hypothetical._—Here the general agreement between\r\nus in a great measure terminates, for Dr. Carpenter is not satisfied\r\nwith the explanation generally adopted by the advocates of the\r\n_wind theory_, viz., that the cold water found in temperate and\r\ninter-tropical areas comes from polar regions as compensating under\r\ncurrents, but advances a _hypothetical_ form of circulation to account\r\nfor the phenomenon. He assumes that there is a _general set_ or flow of\r\nthe surface and upper portion of the ocean from the equator to polar\r\nregions, and a _general set_ or flow of the bottom and under portion of\r\nthe ocean from polar regions to the equator. Mr. Ferrel (_Nature_, June\r\n13, 1872) speaks of that “interchanging motion of the water between the\r\nequator and the pole _discovered_ by Dr. Carpenter.” In this, however,\r\nMr. Ferrel is mistaken; for Dr. Carpenter not only makes no claim to\r\nany discovery of the kind, but distinctly admits that none such has\r\nyet been made. Although in some of his papers he speaks of a “_set_ of\r\nwarm surface-water in the southern oceans toward the Antarctic pole”\r\nas being well known to navigators, yet he nowhere affirms, as far as I\r\nknow, that the existence of such a general oceanic circulation as he\r\nadvocates has ever been directly determined from observations. This\r\nmode of circulation is _simply inferred_ or _assumed_ in order to\r\naccount for the facts referred to above. “At present,” Dr. Carpenter\r\nsays, “I claim for it no higher character than that of a good working\r\n_hypothesis_ to be used as a guide in further inquiry” (§ 16); and lest\r\nthere should be any misapprehension on this point, he closes his memoir\r\nthus:—“At present, as I have already said, I claim for the doctrine of\r\na general oceanic circulation no higher a character than that of a good\r\nworking _hypothesis_ consistent with our present knowledge of facts,\r\nand therefore entitled to be _provisionally_ adopted for the purpose of\r\nstimulating and directing further inquiry.”\r\n\r\nI am unable to agree with him, however, on this latter point. It\r\nseems to me that there is no necessity for adopting any hypothetical\r\nmode of circulation to account for the facts, as they can be quite\r\nwell accounted for by means of that mode of circulation which does\r\n_actually exist_. It has been determined from direct observation that\r\nsurface-currents flow from equatorial to polar regions, and their\r\npaths have been actually mapped out. But if it is established that\r\ncurrents flow from equatorial to polar regions, it is equally so that\r\nreturn currents flow from polar to equatorial regions; for if the one\r\n_actually_ exists, the other of necessity _must_ exist. We know also\r\non physical grounds, to which I have already referred, and which fall\r\nto be considered more fully in a subsequent chapter, that a very large\r\nportion of the water flowing from polar to equatorial regions must\r\nbe in the form of under currents. If there are cold under currents,\r\ntherefore, flowing from polar to temperate and equatorial regions,\r\nthis is all that we really require to account for the cold water which\r\nis found to occupy the bed of the ocean in those regions. It does not\r\nnecessarily follow, because cold water may be found at the bottom of\r\nthe ocean all along the equator, that there must be a direct flow\r\nfrom the polar regions to every point of the equator. Water brought\r\nconstantly from the polar regions to various points along the equator\r\nby means of under currents will necessarily accumulate, and in course\r\nof time spread over the bottom of the inter-tropical seas. It must\r\neither do this, or the currents on reaching the equator must bend\r\nupwards and flow to the surface in an unbroken mass. Considerable\r\nportions of some of those currents may no doubt do so and join\r\nsurface-currents; but probably the greater portion of the water coming\r\nfrom polar regions extends itself over the floor of the equatorial\r\nseas. In a letter in _Nature_, January 11, 1872, I endeavoured to show\r\nthat the surface-currents of the ocean are not separate and independent\r\nof one another, but form one grand system of circulation, and that\r\nthe impelling cause keeping up this system of circulation is not the\r\n_trade-winds_ alone, as is generally supposed, but the _prevailing\r\nwinds of the entire globe considered also as one grand system_. The\r\nevidence for this opinion, however, will be considered more fully in\r\nthe sequel.\r\n\r\nAlthough the under currents are parts of one general system of oceanic\r\ncirculation produced by the impulse of the system of prevailing winds,\r\nyet their direction and position are nevertheless, to a large extent,\r\ndetermined by different laws. The water at the surface, being moved\r\nby the force of the wind, will follow the path of _greatest pressure\r\nand traction_,—the effects resulting from the general contour of the\r\nland, which to a great extent are common to both sets of currents, not\r\nbeing taken into account; while, on the other hand, the under currents\r\nfrom polar regions (which to a great extent are simply “indraughts”\r\ncompensating for the water drained from equatorial regions by the\r\nGulf-stream and other surface currents) will follow, as a general rule,\r\nthe path of _least resistance_.\r\n\r\n_The Cause assigned for the Hypothetical Mode of Circulation._—Dr.\r\nCarpenter assigns a cause for his mode of circulation; and that cause\r\nhe finds in the difference of specific gravity between equatorial\r\nand polar waters, resulting from the difference of temperature\r\nbetween these two regions. “Two separate questions,” he says, “have\r\nto be considered, which have not, perhaps, been kept sufficiently\r\ndistinct, either by Mr. Croll or by myself;—_first_, whether there\r\nis adequate evidence of the existence of a general vertical oceanic\r\ncirculation; and _second_, whether, supposing its existence to be\r\nprovisionally admitted, a _vera causa_ can be found for it in the\r\ndifference of temperature between the oceanic waters of the polar and\r\nequatorial areas” (§ 17). It seems to me that the facts adduced by\r\nDr. Carpenter do not necessarily require the assumption of any such\r\nmode of circulation as that advanced by him. The phenomena can be\r\nsatisfactorily accounted for otherwise; and therefore there does not\r\nappear to be any necessity for considering whether his hypothesis be\r\nsufficient to produce the required effect or not.\r\n\r\n_An important Consideration overlooked._—But there is one important\r\nconsideration which seems to have been overlooked—namely, the fact\r\nthat the sea is salter in inter-tropical than in polar regions, and\r\nthat this circumstance, so far as it goes, must tend to neutralize\r\nthe effect of difference of temperature. It is probable, indeed, that\r\nthe effect produced by difference of temperature is thus entirely\r\nneutralized, and that no difference of density whatever exists between\r\nthe sea in inter-tropical and polar regions, and consequently that\r\nthere is no difference of level nor anything to produce such a general\r\nmotion as Dr. Carpenter supposes. This, I am glad to find, is the\r\nopinion of Professor Wyville Thomson.\r\n\r\n“I am greatly mistaken,” says that author, “if the low specific gravity\r\nof the polar sea, the result of the condensation and precipitation\r\nof vapour evaporated from the inter-tropical area, do not fully\r\ncounterbalance the contraction of the superficial film by arctic\r\ncold.... Speaking in the total absence of all reliable data, it is my\r\ngeneral impression that if we were to set aside all other agencies, and\r\nto trust for an oceanic circulation to those conditions only which are\r\nrelied upon by Dr. Carpenter, if there were any general circulation at\r\nall, which seems very problematical, the odds are rather in favour of\r\na warm under current travelling northwards by virtue of its excess of\r\nsalt, balanced by a surface return current of fresher though colder\r\narctic water.”[62]\r\n\r\nThis is what actually takes place on the west and north-west of\r\nSpitzbergen. There the warm water of the Gulf-stream flows underneath\r\nthe cold polar current. And it is the opinion of Dr. Scoresby, Mr.\r\nClements Markham, and Lieut. Maury that this warm water, in virtue\r\nof its greater saltness, is denser than the polar water. Mr. Leigh\r\nSmith found on the north-west of Spitzbergen the temperature at 500\r\nfathoms to be 52°, and once even 64°, while the water on the surface\r\nwas only a degree or two above freezing.[63] Mr. Aitken, of Darroch,\r\nin a paper lately read before the Royal Scottish Society of Arts,\r\nshowed experimentally that the polar water in regions where the ice is\r\nmelting is actually less dense than the warm and more salt tropical\r\nwaters. Nor will it help the matter in the least to maintain that\r\ndifference of specific gravity is not the reason why the warm water of\r\nthe Gulf-stream passes under the polar stream—because if difference\r\nof specific gravity be not the cause of the warm water underlying the\r\ncold water in polar regions, then difference of specific gravity may\r\nlikewise not be the cause of the cold water underlying the warm at\r\nthe equator; and if so, then there is no necessity for the gravitation\r\nhypothesis of oceanic circulation.\r\n\r\nThere is little doubt that the super-heated stratum at the surface of\r\nthe inter-tropical seas, which stratum, according to Dr. Carpenter,\r\nis of no great thickness, is less dense than the polar water: but if\r\nwe take a column extending from the surface down to the bottom of the\r\nocean, this column at the equator will be found to be as heavy as one\r\nof equal length in the polar area. And if this be the case, then there\r\ncan be no difference of level between the equator and the poles, and\r\nno disturbance of static equilibrium nor anything else to produce\r\ncirculation.\r\n\r\n_Under Currents account for all the Facts better than Dr. Carpenter’s\r\nHypothesis._—Assuming, for the present, the system of prevailing winds\r\nto be the true cause of oceanic currents, it necessarily follows (as\r\nwill be shown hereafter) that a large quantity of Atlantic water must\r\nbe propelled into the Arctic Ocean; and such, as we know, is actually\r\nthe case. The Arctic Ocean, however, as Professor Wyville Thomson\r\nremarks, is a well-nigh closed basin, not permitting of a free outflow\r\ninto the Pacific Ocean of the water impelled into it.\r\n\r\nBut it is evident that the water which is thus being constantly\r\ncarried from the inter-tropical to the arctic regions must somehow\r\nor other find its way back to the equator; in other words, there\r\nmust be a return current equal in magnitude to the direct current.\r\nNow the question to be determined is, what path must this return\r\ncurrent take? It appears to me that it will take the _path of least\r\nresistance_, whether that path may happen to be at the surface or under\r\nthe surface. But that the path of least resistance will, as a general\r\nrule, lie at a very considerable distance below the surface is, I\r\nthink, evident from the following considerations. At the surface the\r\ngeneral direction of the currents is opposite to that of the return\r\ncurrent. The surface motion of the water in the Atlantic is from the\r\nequator to the pole; but the return current must be from the pole to\r\nthe equator. Consequently the surface currents will oppose the motion\r\nof any return current unless that current lie at a considerable depth\r\nbelow the surface currents. Again, the winds, as a general rule, blow\r\nin an opposite direction to the course of the return current, because,\r\naccording to supposition, the winds blow in the direction of the\r\nsurface currents. From all these causes the path of least resistance to\r\nthe return current will, as a general rule, not be at the surface, but\r\nat a very considerable depth below it.\r\n\r\nA large portion of the water from the polar regions no doubt leaves\r\nthose regions as surface currents; but a surface current of this kind,\r\non meeting with some resistance to its onward progress along the\r\nsurface, will dip down and continue its course as an under current. We\r\nhave an example of this in the case of the polar current, which upon\r\nmeeting the Gulf-stream on the banks of Newfoundland divides—a portion\r\nof it dipping down and pursuing its course underneath that stream into\r\nthe Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea. And that this under current\r\nis a real and tangible current, in the proper sense of the term, and\r\nnot an imperceptible movement of the water, is proved by the fact that\r\nlarge icebergs deeply immersed in it are often carried southward with\r\nconsiderable velocity against the united force of the wind and the\r\nGulf-stream.\r\n\r\nDr. Carpenter refers at considerable length (§ 134) to Mr. Mitchell’s\r\nopinion as to the origin of the polar current, which is the same as\r\nthat advanced by Maury, viz., that the impelling cause is difference\r\nof specific gravity. But although Dr. Carpenter quotes Mr. Mitchell’s\r\nopinion, he nevertheless does not appear to adopt it: for in §§ 90−93\r\nand various other places he distinctly states that he does not agree\r\nwith Lieut. Maury’s view that the Gulf-stream and polar current\r\nare caused by difference of density. In fact, Dr. Carpenter seems\r\nparticularly anxious that it should be clearly understood that he\r\ndissents from the theory maintained by Maury. But he does not merely\r\ndeny that the Gulf-stream and polar current can be caused by difference\r\nof density; he even goes so far as to affirm that no sensible current\r\nwhatever can be due to that cause, and adduces the authority of Sir\r\nJohn Herschel in support of that opinion:—“The doctrine of Lieut.\r\nMaury,” he says, “was powerfully and convincingly opposed by Sir\r\nJohn Herschel; who showed, beyond all reasonable doubt, first, that\r\nthe Gulf-stream really has its origin in the propulsive force of the\r\ntrade-winds, and secondly, that the greatest disturbance of equilibrium\r\nwhich can be supposed to result from the agencies invoked by Lieut.\r\nMaury would be utterly inadequate to generate and maintain either the\r\nGulf-stream or any other sensible current” (§ 92). This being Dr.\r\nCarpenter’s belief, it is somewhat singular that he should advance the\r\ncase of the polar current passing under the Gulf-stream as evidence\r\nin favour of his theory; for in reality he could hardly have selected\r\na case more hostile to that theory. In short, it is evident that, if\r\na polar current impelled by a force other than that of gravity can\r\npass from the banks of Newfoundland to the Gulf of Mexico (a distance\r\nof some thousands of miles) under a current flowing in the opposite\r\ndirection and, at the same time, so powerful as the Gulf-stream, it\r\ncould pass much more easily under comparatively still water, or water\r\nflowing in the same direction as itself. And if this be so, then all\r\nour difficulties disappear, and we satisfactorily explain the presence\r\nof cold polar water at the bottom of inter-tropical seas without having\r\nrecourse to the hypothesis advanced by Dr. Carpenter.\r\n\r\nBut we have an example of an under current more inexplicable on the\r\ngravitation hypothesis than even that of the polar current, viz., the\r\nwarm under current of Davis Strait.\r\n\r\nThere is a strong current flowing north from the Atlantic through Davis\r\nStrait into the Arctic Ocean underneath a surface current passing\r\nsouthwards in an opposite direction. Large icebergs have been seen to\r\nbe carried northwards by this under current at the rate of four knots\r\nan hour against both the wind and the surface current, ripping and\r\ntearing their way with terrific force through surface ice of great\r\nthickness.[64] A current so powerful and rapid as this cannot, as Dr.\r\nCarpenter admits, be referred to difference of specific gravity. But\r\neven supposing that it could, still difference of temperature between\r\nthe equatorial and polar seas would not account for it; for the current\r\nin question flows in the _wrong direction_. Nor will it help the matter\r\nthe least to adopt Maury’s explanation, viz., that the warm under\r\ncurrent from the south, in consequence of its greater saltness, is\r\ndenser than the cold one from the polar regions. For if the water of\r\nthe Atlantic, notwithstanding its higher temperature, is in consequence\r\nof its greater saltness so much denser than the polar water on the\r\nwest of Greenland as to produce an under current of four knots an hour\r\nin the direction of the pole, then surely the same thing to a certain\r\nextent will hold true in reference to the ocean on the east side of\r\nGreenland. Thus instead of there being, as Dr. Carpenter supposes,\r\nan underflow of polar water south into the Atlantic in virtue of its\r\n_greater_ density, there ought, on the contrary, to be a surface flow\r\nin consequence of its lesser density.\r\n\r\nThe true explanation no doubt is, that the warm under current from\r\nthe south and the cold upper current from the north are both parts\r\nof one grand system of circulation produced by the winds, difference\r\nof specific gravity having no share whatever either in impelling the\r\ncurrents, or in determining which shall be the upper and which the\r\nlower.\r\n\r\nThe wind in Baffin’s Bay and Davis Strait blows nearly always in one\r\ndirection, viz. from the north. The tendency of this is to produce a\r\nsurface or upper current from the north down into the Atlantic, and to\r\nprevent or retard any surface current from the south. The warm current\r\nfrom the Atlantic, taking the path of least resistance, dips under the\r\npolar current and pursues its course as an under current.\r\n\r\nMr. Clements Markham, in his “Threshold of the Unknown Region,” is\r\ninclined to attribute the motion of the icebergs to tidal action or\r\nto counter under currents. That the motion of the icebergs cannot\r\nreasonably be attributed to the tides is, I think, evident from the\r\ndescriptions given both by Midshipman Griffin and by Captain Duncan,\r\nwho distinctly saw the icebergs moving at the rate of about four knots\r\nan hour against a surface current flowing southwards. And Captain\r\nDuncan states that the bergs continued their course northwards for\r\nseveral days, till they ultimately disappeared. The probability is that\r\nthis northward current is composed partly of Gulf-stream water and\r\npartly of that portion of polar water which is supposed to flow round\r\nCape Farewell from the east coast of Greenland. This stream, composed\r\nof both warm and cold water, on reaching to about latitude 65°N., where\r\nit encounters the strong northerly winds, dips down under the polar\r\ncurrent and continues its northward course as an under current.\r\n\r\nWe have on the west of Spitzbergen, as has already been noticed, a\r\nsimilar example of a warm current from the south passing under a polar\r\ncurrent. A portion of the Gulf-stream which passes round the west\r\ncoast of Spitzbergen flows under an arctic current coming down from\r\nthe north; and it does so no doubt because it is here in the region of\r\nprevailing northerly winds, which favour the polar current but oppose\r\nthe Gulf-stream. Again, we have a cold and rapid current sweeping\r\nround the east and south of Spitzbergen, a current of which Mr. Lamont\r\nasserts that he is positive he has seen it running at the rate of seven\r\nor eight miles an hour. This current, on meeting the Gulf-stream about\r\nthe northern entrance to the German Ocean, dips down under that stream\r\nand pursues its course southwards as an under current.\r\n\r\nSeveral other cases of under currents might be adduced which cannot\r\nbe explained on the gravitation theory, and which must be referred to\r\na system of oceanic circulation produced by the impulse of the wind;\r\nbut these will suffice to show that the assumption that the winds can\r\nproduce only a mere surface-drift is directly opposed to facts. And\r\nit will not do to affirm that a current which forms part of a general\r\nsystem of circulation produced by the impulse of the winds cannot\r\npossibly be an under current; for in the case referred to we have\r\nproof that the thing is not only possible but actually exists. This\r\npoint, however, will be better understood after we have considered the\r\nevidence in favour of a general system of oceanic currents.\r\n\r\nMuch of the difficulty experienced in comprehending how under currents\r\ncan be produced by the wind, or how an impulse imparted to the surface\r\nof the ocean can ever be transmitted to the bottom, appears to me to\r\nresult, to a considerable extent at least, from a slight deception\r\nof the imagination. The thing which impresses us most forcibly in\r\nregard to the ocean is its profound depth. A mean depth of, say, three\r\nmiles produces a striking impression; but if we could represent to\r\nthe mind the vast area of the ocean as correctly as we can its depth,\r\n_shallowness_ rather than _depth_ would be the impression produced. If\r\nin crossing a meadow we found a sheet of water one hundred yards in\r\ndiameter and only an inch in depth, we should not call that a _deep_,\r\nbut a very _shallow_ pool. The probability is that we should speak of\r\nit as simply a piece of ground covered with a thin layer of water.\r\nYet such a thin layer of water would be a correct representation in\r\nminiature of the ocean; for the ocean in relation to its superficial\r\narea is as shallow as the pool of our illustration. In reference to\r\nsuch a pool or thin film of water, we have no difficulty in conceiving\r\nhow a disturbance on its surface would be transmitted to its bottom.\r\nIn fact our difficulty is in conceiving how any disturbance extending\r\nover its entire surface should not extend to the bottom. Now if we\r\ncould form as accurate a sensuous impression of the vast area of the\r\nocean as we do of such a pool, all our difficulty in understanding how\r\nthe impulses of the wind acting on the vast area of the ocean should\r\ncommunicate motion down to its bottom would disappear. It is certainly\r\ntrue that sudden commotions caused by storms do not generally extend to\r\ngreat depths. Neither will winds of short continuance produce a current\r\nextending far below the surface. But prevailing winds which can produce\r\nsuch immense surface-flow as that of the great equatorial currents of\r\nthe globe and the Gulf-stream, which follow definite directions, must\r\ncommunicate their motion to great depths, unless water be frictionless,\r\na thing which it is not. Suppose the upper layer of the ocean to be\r\nforced on by the direct action of the winds with a constant velocity\r\nof, say, four miles an hour, the layer immediately below will be\r\ndragged along with a constant velocity somewhat less than four miles\r\nan hour. The layer immediately below this second layer will in turn be\r\nalso dragged along with a constant velocity somewhat less than the one\r\nabove it. The same will take place in regard to each succeeding layer,\r\nthe constant velocity of each layer being somewhat less than the one\r\nimmediately above it, and greater than the one below it. The question\r\nto be determined is, at what depth will all motion cease? I presume\r\nthat at present we have not sufficient data for properly determining\r\nthis point. The depth will depend, other things being equal, upon the\r\namount of molecular resistance offered by the water to motion—in other\r\nwords, on the amount of the shearing-force of the one layer over the\r\nother. The fact, however, that motion imparted to the surface will\r\nextend to great depths can be easily shown by direct experiment. If a\r\nconstant motion be imparted to the surface of water, say, in a vessel,\r\nmotion will ultimately be communicated to the bottom, no matter how\r\nwide or how deep the vessel may be. The same effect will take place\r\nwhether the vessel be 5 feet deep or 500 feet deep.\r\n\r\n_The known Condition of the Ocean inconsistent with Dr. Carpenter’s\r\nHypothesis._—Dr. Carpenter says that he looks forward with great\r\nsatisfaction to the results of the inquiries which are being prosecuted\r\nby the Circumnavigation Expedition, in the hope that the facts brought\r\nto light may establish his theory of a general oceanic circulation; and\r\nhe specifies certain of these facts which, if found to be correct, will\r\nestablish his theory. It seems to me, however, that the facts to which\r\nhe refers are just as explicable on the theory of under currents as on\r\nthe theory of a general oceanic circulation. He begins by saying, “If\r\nthe views I have propounded be correct, it may be expected that near\r\nthe border of the great antarctic ice-barrier a temperature below 30°\r\nwill be met with (as it has been by Parry, Martens, and Weyprecht near\r\nSpitzbergen) at no great depth beneath the surface, and that instead of\r\nrising at still greater depths, the thermometer will fall to near the\r\nfreezing-point of salt water” (§ 39).\r\n\r\nDr. Carpenter can hardly claim this as evidence in favour of his\r\ntheory; for near the borders of the ice-barrier the water, as a matter\r\nof course, could not be expected to have a much higher temperature than\r\nthe ice itself. And if the observations be made during summer months,\r\nthe temperature of the water at the surface will no doubt be found to\r\nbe higher than that of the bottom; but if they be carried on during\r\nwinter, the surface-temperature will doubtless be found to be as low as\r\nthe bottom-temperature. These are results which do not depend upon any\r\nparticular theory of oceanic circulation.\r\n\r\n“The bottom temperature of the North Pacific,” he continues, “will\r\nafford a crucial test of the truth of the doctrine. For since the sole\r\ncommunication of this vast oceanic area with the arctic basin is a\r\nstrait so shallow as only to permit an inflow of warm surface water,\r\nits deep cold stratum must be entirely derived from the antarctic area;\r\nand if its bottom temperature is not actually higher than that of the\r\nSouth Pacific, the glacial stratum ought to be found at a greater depth\r\nnorth of the equator than south of it” (§ 39).\r\n\r\nThis may probably show that the water came from the antarctic regions,\r\nbut cannot possibly prove that it came in the manner which he supposes.\r\n\r\n“In the North Atlantic, again, the comparative limitation of\r\ncommunication with the arctic area may be expected to prevent its\r\nbottom temperature from being reduced as low as that of the Southern\r\nAtlantic” (§ 39). Supposing the bottom temperature of the South\r\nAtlantic should be found to be lower than the bottom temperature of the\r\nNorth Atlantic, this fact will be just as consistent with the theory of\r\nunder currents as with his theory of a general movement of the ocean.\r\n\r\nI am also wholly unable to comprehend how he should imagine, because\r\nthe bottom temperature of the South Atlantic happens to be lower, and\r\nthe polar water to lie nearer to the surface in this ocean than in the\r\nNorth Atlantic, that therefore this proves the truth of his theory.\r\nThis condition of matters is just as consistent, and even more so, as\r\nwill be shown in Chapter XIII., with my theory as with his. When we\r\nconsider the immense quantity of warm surface water which, as has been\r\nshown (Chapter V.), is being constantly transferred from the South into\r\nthe North Atlantic, we readily understand how the polar water comes\r\nnearer to the surface in the former ocean than in the latter. Every\r\npound of water, of course, passing from the southern to the northern\r\nhemisphere must be compensated by an equal amount passing from the\r\nnorthern to the southern hemisphere. But nevertheless the warm water\r\ndrained off the South Atlantic is not replaced directly by water from\r\nthe north, but by that cold antarctic current, the existence of which\r\nis, unfortunately, too well known to navigators from the immense masses\r\nof icebergs which it brings along with it. In fact, the whole of the\r\nphenomena are just as easily explained upon the principle of under\r\ncurrents as upon Dr. Carpenter’s theory. But we shall have to return to\r\nthis point in Chapter XIII., when we come to discuss a class of facts\r\nwhich appear to be wholly irreconcilable with the gravitation theory.\r\n\r\nIndeed I fear that even although Dr. Carpenter’s expectations should\r\neventually be realised in the results of the Circumnavigation\r\nExpedition, yet the advocates of the wind theory will still remain\r\nunconverted. In fact the Director of this Expedition has already, on\r\nthe wind theory, offered an explanation of nearly all the phenomena\r\non which Dr. Carpenter relies;[65] and the same has also been done by\r\nDr. Petermann,[66] who, as is well known, is equally opposed to Dr.\r\nCarpenter’s theory. Dr. Carpenter directs attention to the necessity of\r\nexamining the broad and deep channel separating Iceland from Greenland.\r\nThe observations which have already been made, however, show that\r\nnearly the entire channel is occupied, on the surface at least, by\r\nwater flowing southward from the polar area—a direction the opposite of\r\nwhat it ought to be according to the gravitation theory. In fact the\r\nsurface of one half of the entire area of the ocean, extending from\r\nGreenland to the North Cape, is moving in a direction the opposite of\r\nthat which it ought to take according to the theory under review. The\r\nwestern half of this area is occupied by water which at the surface is\r\nflowing southwards; while the eastern half, which has hitherto been\r\nregarded by almost everybody but Dr. Carpenter himself and Mr. Findlay\r\nas an extension of the Gulf-stream, is moving polewards. The motion of\r\nthe western half must be attributed to the winds and not to gravity;\r\nfor it is moving in the wrong direction to be accounted for by the\r\nlatter cause; but had it been moving in the opposite direction, no\r\ndoubt its motion would have been referred to gravitation. To this cause\r\nthe motion of the eastern half, which is in the proper direction, is\r\nattributed;[67] but why not assign this motion also to the impulse of\r\nthe winds, more especially since the direction of the prevailing winds\r\nblowing over that area coincides with that of the water? If the wind\r\ncan produce the motion of the water in the western half, why may not it\r\ndo the same in the eastern half?\r\n\r\nIf there be such a difference of density between equatorial and polar\r\nwaters as to produce a general flow of the upper portion of the ocean\r\npoleward, how does it happen that one half of the water in the above\r\narea is moving in opposition to gravity? How is it that in a wide\r\nopen sea gravitation should act so powerfully in the one half of it\r\nand with so little effect in the other half? There is probably little\r\ndoubt that the ice-cold water of the western half extends from the\r\nsurface down to the bottom. And it is also probable that the bottom\r\nwater is moving southwards in the same direction as the surface water.\r\nThe bottom water in such a case would be moving in harmony with the\r\ngravitation theory; but would Dr. Carpenter on this account attribute\r\nits motion to gravity? Would he attribute the motion of the lower half\r\nto gravity and the upper half to the wind? He could not in consistency\r\nwith his theory attribute the motion of the upper half to gravity: for\r\nalthough the ice-cold water extended to the surface, this could not\r\nexplain how gravity should move it southward instead of polewards, as\r\naccording to theory it ought to move. He might affirm, if he chose,\r\nthat the surface water moves southwards because it is dragged forward\r\nby the bottom water; but if this view be held, he is not entitled to\r\naffirm, as he does, that the winds can only produce a mere surface\r\ndrift. If the viscosity and molecular resistance of water be such that,\r\nwhen the lower strata of the ocean are impelled forward by gravity or\r\nby any other cause, the superincumbent strata extending to the surface\r\nare perforce dragged after them, then, for the same reason, when the\r\nupper strata are impelled forward by the wind or any other cause, the\r\nunderlying strata must also be dragged along after them.\r\n\r\nIf the condition of the ocean between Greenland and the north-western\r\nshore of Europe is irreconcilable with the gravitation theory, we find\r\nthe case even worse for that theory when we direct our attention to\r\nthe condition of the ocean on the southern hemisphere; for according\r\nto the researches of Captain Duperrey and others on the currents of\r\nthe Southern Ocean, a very large portion of the area of that ocean is\r\noccupied by water moving on the surface more in a northward than a\r\npoleward direction. Referring to the deep trough between the Shetland\r\nand the Faroe Islands, called by him the “Lightning Channel,” Dr.\r\nCarpenter says, “If my view be correct, a current-drag suspended in\r\nthe _upper_ stratum ought to have a perceptible movement in the N.E.\r\ndirection; whilst another, suspended in the _lower_ stratum, should\r\nmove S.W.” (§ 40).\r\n\r\nAny one believing in the north-eastern extension of the Gulf-stream\r\nand in the Spitsbergen polar under current, to which I have already\r\nreferred, would not feel surprised to learn that the surface strata\r\nhave a perceptible north-eastward motion, and the bottom strata a\r\nperceptible south-westward motion. North-east and east of Iceland\r\nthere is a general flow of cold polar water in a south-east direction\r\ntowards the left edge of the Gulf-stream. This water, as Professor Mohn\r\nconcludes, “descends beneath the Gulf-stream and partially finds an\r\noutlet in the lower half of the Faroe-Shetland channel.”[68]\r\n\r\n_An Objection Considered._—In Nature, vol. ix. p. 423, Dr. Carpenter\r\nhas advanced the following objection to the foregoing theory of\r\nunder-currents:—“According to Mr. Croll’s doctrine, the whole of that\r\nvast mass of water in the North Atlantic, averaging, say, 1,500 fathoms\r\nin thickness and 3,600 miles in breadth, the temperature of which\r\n(from 40° downwards), as ascertained by the _Challenger_ soundings,\r\nclearly shows it to be mainly derived from a polar source, is nothing\r\nelse than _the reflux of the Gulf-stream_. Now, even if we suppose\r\nthat the whole of this stream, as it passes Sandy Hook, were to go on\r\ninto the closed arctic basin, it would only force out an equivalent\r\nbody of water. And as, on comparing the sectional areas of the two,\r\nI find that of the Gulf-stream to be about 1/900th that of the North\r\nAtlantic underflow; and as it is admitted that a large part of the\r\nGulf-stream returns into the Mid-Atlantic circulation, only a branch of\r\nit going on to the north-east, the extreme improbability (may I not say\r\nimpossibility?) that so vast a mass of water can be put in motion by\r\nwhat is by comparison a mere rivulet (the north-east motion of which,\r\nas a distinct current, has not been traced eastward of 30° W. long.)\r\nseems still more obvious.”\r\n\r\nIn this objection three things are assumed: (1) that the mass of cold\r\nwater 1,500 fathoms deep and 3,600 miles in breadth is in a state of\r\nmotion towards the equator; (2) that it cannot be the reflux of the\r\nGulf-stream, because its sectional area is 900 times as great as that\r\nof the Gulf-stream; (3) that the immense mass of water is, according to\r\nmy views, set in motion by the Gulf-stream.\r\n\r\nAs this objection has an important bearing on the question under\r\nconsideration, I shall consider these three assumptions separately\r\nand in their order: (1) That this immense mass of cold water came\r\noriginally from the polar regions I, of course, admit, but that the\r\nwhole is in a state of motion I certainly do not admit. There is no\r\nwarrant whatever for any such assumption. According to Dr. Carpenter\r\nhimself, the heating-power of the sun does not extend to any great\r\ndepth below the surface; consequently there is nothing whatever to\r\nheat this mass but the heat coming through the earth’s crust. But\r\nthe amount of heat derived from this source is so trifling, that an\r\nunder current from the arctic regions far less in volume than that\r\nof the Gulf-stream would be quite sufficient to keep the mass at an\r\nice-cold temperature. Taking the area of the North Atlantic between\r\nthe equator and the Tropic of Cancer, including also the Caribbean\r\nSea and the Gulf of Mexico, to be 7,700,000 square miles, and the\r\nrate at which internal heat passes through the earth’s surface to be\r\nthat assigned by Sir William Thomson, we find that the total quantity\r\nof heat derived from the earth’s crust by the above area is equal to\r\nabout 88 × 10^{15} foot-pounds per day. But this amount is equal to\r\nonly 1/894th that conveyed by the Gulf-stream, on the supposition that\r\neach pound of water carries 19,300 foot-pounds of heat. Consequently\r\nan under current from the polar regions of not more than 1/35th the\r\nvolume of the Gulf-stream would suffice to keep the entire mass of\r\nwater of that area within 1° of what it would be were there no heat\r\nderived from the crust of the earth; that is to say, were the water\r\nconveyed by the under current at 32°, internal heat would not maintain\r\nthe mass of the ocean in the above area at more than 33°. The entire\r\narea of the North Atlantic from the equator to the arctic circle is\r\nsomewhere about 16,000,000 square miles. An under current of less than\r\n1/17th that of the Gulf-stream coming from the arctic regions would\r\ntherefore suffice to keep the entire North Atlantic basin filled with\r\nice-cold water. In short, whatever theory we adopt regarding oceanic\r\ncirculation, it follows equally as a necessary consequence that the\r\nentire mass of the ocean below the stratum heated by the sun’s rays\r\nmust consist of cold water. For if cold water be continually coming\r\nfrom the polar regions either in the form of under currents, or in the\r\nform of a general underflow as Dr. Carpenter supposes, the entire under\r\nportion of the ocean must ultimately become occupied by cold water; for\r\nthere is no source from which this influx of water can derive heat,\r\nsave from the earth’s crust. But the amount thus derived is so trifling\r\nas to produce no sensible effect. For example, a polar under current\r\none half the size of the Gulf-stream would be sufficient to keep the\r\nentire water of the globe (below the stratum heated by the sun’s rays)\r\nat an ice-cold temperature. Internal heat would not be sufficient under\r\nsuch circumstances to maintain the mass 1° Fahr. above the temperature\r\nit possessed when it left the polar regions.\r\n\r\nIt follows therefore that the presence of the immense mass of ice-cold\r\nwater in the great depths of the ocean is completely accounted for by\r\nunder currents, and there is no necessity for supposing it to be all\r\nin a state of motion towards the equator. In fact, this very state of\r\nthings, which the general oceanic circulation hypothesis was devised to\r\nexplain, results as a necessary consequence of polar under currents.\r\nUnless these were entirely stopped it is physically impossible that the\r\nocean could be in any other condition.\r\n\r\nBut suppose that this immense mass of cold water occupying the great\r\ndepths of the ocean were, as Dr. Carpenter assumes it to be, in a\r\nstate of constant motion towards the equator, and that its sectional\r\narea were 900 times that of the Gulf-stream, it would not therefore\r\nfollow that the quantity of water passing through this large sectional\r\narea must be greater than that flowing through a sectional area of\r\nthe Gulf-stream; for the quantity of water flowing through this large\r\nsectional area depends entirely on the rate of motion.\r\n\r\nI am wholly unable to understand how it could be supposed that this\r\nunderflow, according to my view, is set in motion by the Gulf-stream,\r\nseeing that I have shown that the return under current is as much due\r\nto the impulse of the wind as the Gulf-stream itself.\r\n\r\nDr. Carpenter lays considerable stress on the important fact\r\nestablished by the _Challenger_ expedition, that the great depths of\r\nthe sea in equatorial regions are occupied by ice-cold water, while\r\nthe portion heated by the sun’s rays is simply a thin stratum at the\r\nsurface. It seems to me that it would be difficult to find a fact more\r\nhostile to his theory than this. Were it not for this upper stratum\r\nof heated water there would be no difference between the equatorial\r\nand polar columns, and consequently nothing to produce motion. But the\r\nthinner this stratum is the less is the difference, and the less there\r\nis to produce motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n           EXAMINATION OF THE GRAVITATION THEORY OF OCEANIC\r\n         CIRCULATION.—THE MECHANICS OF DR. CARPENTER’S THEORY.\r\n\r\n  Experimental Illustration of the Theory.—The Force exerted by\r\n      Gravity.—Work performed by Gravity.—Circulation not by\r\n      Convection.—Circulation depends on Difference in Density\r\n      of the Equatorial and Polar Columns.—Absolute Amount of\r\n      Work which can be performed by Gravity.—How Underflow is\r\n      produced.—How Vertical Descent at the Poles and Ascent at\r\n      the Equator is produced.—The Gibraltar Current.—Mistake in\r\n      Mechanics concerning it.—The Baltic Current.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Experiment to illustrate Theory._—In support of the theory of a\r\ngeneral movement of water between equatorial and polar regions, Dr.\r\nCarpenter adduces the authority of Humboldt and of Prof. Buff.[69]\r\nI have been unable to find anything in the writings of either from\r\nwhich it can be inferred that they have given this matter special\r\nconsideration. Humboldt merely alludes to the theory, and that in the\r\nmost casual manner; and that Prof. Buff has not carefully investigated\r\nthe subject is apparent from the very illustration quoted by Dr.\r\nCarpenter from the “Physics of the Earth.” “The water of the ocean at\r\ngreat depths,” says Prof. Buff, “has a temperature, even under the\r\nequator, nearly approaching to the freezing-point. This low temperature\r\ncannot depend on any influence of the sea-bottom.... The fact, however,\r\nis explained by a continual current of cold water flowing from the\r\npolar regions towards the equator. The following well-known experiment\r\nclearly illustrates the manner of this movement. A glass vessel is to\r\nbe filled with water with which some powder has been mixed, and is then\r\nto be heated _at bottom_. It will soon be seen, from the motion of the\r\nparticles of powder, that currents are set up in opposite directions\r\nthrough the water. Warm water rises from the bottom up through the\r\nmiddle of the vessel, and spreads over the surface, while the colder\r\nand therefore heavier liquid falls down at the sides of the glass.”\r\n\r\nThis illustration is evidently intended to show not merely the form\r\nand direction of the great system of oceanic circulation, but also the\r\nmode in which the circulation is induced by heat. It is no doubt true\r\nthat if we apply heat (say that of a spirit-lamp) to the bottom of a\r\nvessel filled with water, the water at the bottom of the vessel will\r\nbecome heated and rise to the surface; and if the heat be continued\r\nan ascending current of warm water will be generated; and this, of\r\ncourse, will give rise to a compensating under current of colder water\r\nfrom all sides. In like manner it is also true that, if heat were\r\napplied to the bottom of the ocean in equatorial regions, an ascending\r\ncurrent of hot water would be also generated, giving rise to an under\r\ncurrent of cold water from the polar regions. But all this is the\r\ndiametrically opposite of what actually takes place in nature. The heat\r\nis not applied to the bottom of the ocean, so as to make the water\r\nthere lighter than the water at the surface, and thus to generate an\r\nascending current; but the heat is applied to the surface of the ocean,\r\nand the effect of this is to prevent an ascending current rather than\r\nto produce one, for it tends to keep the water at the surface lighter\r\nthan the water at the bottom. In order to show how the heat of the sun\r\nproduces currents in the ocean, Prof. Buff should have applied the\r\nheat, not to the bottom of his vessel, but to the upper surface of the\r\nwater. But this is not all, the form of the vessel has something to\r\ndo with the matter. The wider we make the vessel in proportion to its\r\ndepth, the more difficult it is to produce currents by means of heat.\r\nBut in order to represent what takes place in nature, we ought to have\r\nthe same proportion between the depth and the superficial area of the\r\nwater in our vessel as there is between the depth and the superficial\r\narea of the sea. The mean depth of the sea may be taken roughly to be\r\nabout three miles.[70] The distance between pole and pole we shall take\r\nin round numbers to be 12,000 miles. The sun may therefore be regarded\r\nas shining upon a circular sea 12,000 miles in diameter and three miles\r\ndeep. The depth of the sea to its diameter is therefore as 1 to 4,000.\r\nSuppose, now, that in our experiment we make the depth of our vessel\r\none inch, we shall require to make its diameter 4,000 inches, or 333\r\nfeet, say, in round numbers, 100 yards in diameter. Let us, then, take\r\na pool of water 100 yards in diameter, and one inch deep. Suppose the\r\nwater to be at 32°. Apply heat to the upper surface of the pool, so\r\nas to raise the temperature of the surface of the water to 80° at the\r\ncentre of the pool, the temperature diminishing towards the edge, where\r\nit is at 32°. It is found that at a depth of two miles the temperature\r\nof the water at the equator is about as low as that of the poles. We\r\nmust therefore suppose the water at the centre of our pool to diminish\r\nin temperature from the surface downwards, so that at a depth of half\r\nan inch the water is at 32°. We have in this case a thin layer of warm\r\nwater half an inch thick at the centre, and gradually thinning off to\r\nnothing at the edge of the pool. The lightest water, be it observed,\r\nis at the surface, so that an ascending or a descending current\r\nis impossible. The only way whereby the heat applied can have any\r\ntendency to produce motion is this:—The heating of the water expands\r\nit, consequently the surface of the pool must stand at a little higher\r\nlevel at its centre than at its edge, where no expansion takes place;\r\nand therefore, in order to restore the level of the pool, the water at\r\nthe centre will tend to flow towards the sides. But what is the amount\r\nof this tendency? Its amount will depend upon the amount of slope,\r\nbut the slope in the case under consideration amounts to only 1 in\r\n7,340,000.\r\n\r\n_Dr. Carpenter’s Experiment._—In order to obviate the objection to\r\nProfessor Buff’s experiment Dr. Carpenter has devised another mode.\r\nBut I presume his experiment was intended rather to illustrate the way\r\nin which the circulation of the ocean, according to his theory, takes\r\nplace, than to prove that it actually does take place. At any rate, all\r\nthat can be claimed for the experiment is the proof that water will\r\ncirculate in consequence of difference of specific gravity resulting\r\nfrom difference of temperature. But this does not require proof, for no\r\nphysicist denies it. The point which requires to be proved is this. Is\r\nthe difference of specific gravity which exists in the ocean sufficient\r\nto produce the supposed circulation? Now his mode of experimenting\r\nwill not prove this, unless he makes his experiment agree with the\r\nconditions already stated.\r\n\r\nBut I decidedly object to the water being heated in the way in which it\r\nhas been done by him in his experiment before the Royal Geographical\r\nSociety; for I feel somewhat confident that in this experiment the\r\ncirculation resulted not from difference of specific gravity, as was\r\nsupposed, but rather from the way in which the heat was applied. In\r\nthat experiment the one half of a thick metallic plate was placed in\r\ncontact with the upper surface of the water at one end of the trough;\r\nthe other half, projecting over the end of the trough, was heated\r\nby means of a spirit-lamp. It is perfectly obvious that though the\r\ntemperature of the great mass of the water under the plate might not\r\nbe raised over 80° or so, yet the molecules in contact with the metal\r\nwould have a very high temperature. These molecules, in consequence of\r\ntheir expansion, would be unable to sink into the cooler and denser\r\nwater underneath, and thus escape the heat which was being constantly\r\ncommunicated to them from the heated plate. But escape they must, or\r\ntheir temperature would continue to rise until they would ultimately\r\nburst into vapour. They cannot ascend, neither can they descend: they\r\ntherefore must be expelled by the heat from the plate in a horizontal\r\ndirection. The next layer of molecules from beneath would take their\r\nplace and would be expelled in a similar manner, and this process would\r\ncontinue so long as the heat was applied to the plate. A circulation\r\nwould thus be established by the direct expansive force of vapour, and\r\nnot in any way due to difference of specific gravity, as Dr. Carpenter\r\nsupposes.\r\n\r\nBut supposing the heated bar to be replaced by a piece of ice,\r\ncirculation would no doubt take place; but this proves nothing more\r\nthan that difference of density will produce circulation, which is what\r\nno one calls in question.\r\n\r\nThe case referred to by Dr. Carpenter of the heating apparatus in\r\nLondon University is also unsatisfactory. The water leaves the boiler\r\nat 120° and returns to it at 80°. The difference of specific gravity\r\nbetween the water leaving the boiler and the water returning to it\r\nis supposed to produce the circulation. It seems to me that this\r\ndifference of specific gravity has nothing whatever to do with the\r\nmatter. The cause of the circulation must be sought for in the boiler\r\nitself, and not in the pipes. The heat is applied to the bottom of\r\nthe boiler, not to the top. What is the temperature of the molecules\r\nin contact with the bottom of the boiler directly over the fire, is\r\na question which must be considered before we can arrive at a just\r\ndetermination of the causes which produce circulation in the pipes\r\nof a heating apparatus such as that to which Dr. Carpenter refers.\r\nBut, in addition to this, as the heat is applied to the bottom of the\r\nboiler and not to the top, convection comes into play, a cause which,\r\nas we shall find, does not come into play in the theory of oceanic\r\ncirculation at present under our consideration.\r\n\r\n_The Force exerted by Gravity._—Dr. Carpenter speaks of his doctrine of\r\na general oceanic circulation sustained by difference of temperature\r\nalone, “as one of which physical geographers could not recognise the\r\nimportance, so long as they remained under the dominant idea that\r\nthe temperature of the deep sea is everywhere 39°.” And he affirms\r\nthat “until it is clearly apprehended that sea-water becomes more and\r\nmore dense as its temperature is reduced, the immense motive power of\r\npolar cold cannot be understood.” But in chap. vii. and also in the\r\nPhil. Mag. for October, 1870 and 1871, I proved that if we take 39°\r\nas the temperature of maximum density the force exerted by gravity\r\ntending to produce circulation is just as great as when we take 32°.\r\nThe reason for this is that when we take 32° as the temperature of\r\nmaximum density, although we have, it is true, a greater elevation of\r\nthe ocean above the place of maximum density, yet this latter occurs at\r\nthe poles; while on the other hand, when we take 39°, the difference\r\nof level is less—the place not being at the poles but in about lat.\r\n56°. Now the shorter slope from the equator to lat. 56° is as steep as\r\nthe larger one from the equator to the poles, and consequently gravity\r\nexerts as much force in the production of motion in the one case as in\r\nthe other. Sir John Herschel, taking 39° as the temperature of maximum\r\ndensity, estimated the slope at 1/32nd of an inch per mile, whereas\r\nwe, taking 32° as the actual temperature of maximum density of the\r\npolar seas and calculating from modern data, find that the slope is not\r\none-half that amount, and that the force of gravity tending to produce\r\ncirculation is much less than Herschel concluded it to be. The reason,\r\ntherefore, why physical geographers did not adopt the theory that\r\noceanic circulation is the result of difference of temperature could\r\nnot possibly be the one assigned by Dr. Carpenter, viz., that they had\r\nunder-estimated the force of gravity by taking 39° instead of 32° as\r\nthe temperature of maximum density.\r\n\r\n_The Work performed by Gravity._—But in order clearly to understand\r\nthis point, it will be better to treat the matter according to the\r\nthird method, and consider not the mere _force_ of gravity impelling\r\nthe waters, but the amount of _work_ which gravitation is capable of\r\nperforming.\r\n\r\nLet us then assume the correctness of my estimate, that the height of\r\nthe surface of the ocean at the equator above that at the poles is 4\r\nfeet 6 inches, for in representing the mode in which difference of\r\nspecific gravity produces circulation it is of no importance what we\r\nmay fix upon as the amount of the slope. In order, therefore, to avoid\r\nfractions of a foot, I shall take the slope at 4 feet instead of 4½\r\nfeet, which it actually is. A pound of water in flowing down this slope\r\nfrom the equator to either of the poles will perform 4 foot-pounds of\r\nwork; or, more properly speaking, gravitation will. Now it is evident\r\nthat when this pound of water has reached the pole, it is at the\r\nbottom of the slope, and consequently cannot descend further. Gravity,\r\ntherefore, cannot perform any more work upon it; as it can only do so\r\nwhile the thing acted upon continues to descend—that is, moves under\r\nthe force exerted. But the water will not move under the influence\r\nof gravity unless it move downward; it being in this direction only\r\nthat gravity acts on the water. “But,” says Dr. Carpenter, “the effect\r\nof surface-cold upon the water of the polar basin will be to reduce\r\nthe temperature of its whole mass below the freezing-point of fresh\r\nwater, the surface-stratum _sinking_ as it is cooled in virtue of its\r\ndiminished bulk and increased density, and being replaced by water not\r\nyet cooled to the same degree.”[71] By the cooling of the whole mass\r\nof polar water by cold and the heating of the water at the equator by\r\nthe sun’s rays the polar column of water, as we have seen, is rendered\r\ndenser than the equatorial one, and in order that the two may balance\r\neach other, the polar column is necessarily shorter than the equatorial\r\nby 4 feet; and thus it is that the slope of 4 feet is formed. It is\r\nperfectly true that the water which leaves the equator warm and light,\r\nbecomes by the time it reaches the pole cold and dense. But unless\r\nit be denser than the underlying polar water it will not sink down\r\n_through_ it.[72] We are not told, however, why it should be colder\r\nthan the whole mass underneath, which, according to Dr. Carpenter,\r\nis cooled by polar cold. But that he does suppose it to sink to the\r\nbottom in consequence of its contraction by cold would appear from the\r\nfollowing quotation:—\r\n\r\n“Until it is clearly apprehended that sea-water becomes more and more\r\ndense as its temperature is reduced, and that it consequently continues\r\nto sink until it freezes, the immense motor power of polar cold cannot\r\nbe apprehended. But when this has been clearly recognised, it is seen\r\nthat the application of _cold at the surface_ is precisely equivalent\r\nas a moving power to that application of _heat at the bottom_ by which\r\nthe circulation of water is sustained in every heating apparatus that\r\nmakes use of it” (§ 25).\r\n\r\nThe application of cold at the surface is thus held to be equivalent\r\nas a motor power to the application of heat at the bottom. But heat\r\napplied to the bottom of a vessel produces circulation by _convection_.\r\nIt makes the molecules at the bottom expand, and they, in consequence\r\nof buoyancy, rise _through_ the water in the vessel. Consequently if\r\nthe action of cold at the surface in polar regions is equivalent to\r\nthat of heat, the cold must contract the molecules at the surface and\r\nmake them sink _through_ the mass of polar water beneath. But assuming\r\nthis to be the meaning in the passage just quoted, how much colder is\r\nthe surface water than the water beneath? Let us suppose the difference\r\nto be one degree. How much work, then, will gravity perform upon this\r\none pound of water which is one degree colder than the mass beneath\r\nsupposed to be at 32°? The force with which the pound of water will\r\nsink will not be proportional to its weight, but to the difference\r\nof weight between it and a similar bulk of the water through which\r\nit sinks. The difference between the weight of a pound of water at\r\n31° and an equal volume of water at 32° is 1/29,000th of a pound. Now\r\nthis pound of water in sinking to a depth of 10,000 feet, which is\r\nabout the depth at which a polar temperature is found at the equator,\r\nwould perform only one-third of a foot-pound of work. And supposing\r\nit were three degrees colder than the water beneath, it would in\r\nsinking perform only one foot-pound. This would give us only 4 + 1 = 5\r\nfoot-pounds as the total amount that could be performed by gravitation\r\non the pound of water from the time that it left the equator till\r\nit returned to the point from which it started. The amount of work\r\nperformed in descending the slope from the equator to the pole and in\r\nsinking to a depth of 10,000 feet or so through the polar water assumed\r\nto be warmer than the surface water, comprehends the total amount of\r\nwork that gravitation can possibly perform; so that the amount of force\r\ngained by such a supposition over and above that derived from the slope\r\nis trifling.\r\n\r\nIt would appear, however, that this is not what is meant after all.\r\nWhat Dr. Carpenter apparently means is this: when a quantity of water,\r\nsay a layer one foot thick, flows down from the equator to the pole,\r\nthe polar column becomes then heavier than the equatorial by the\r\nweight of this additional layer. A layer of water equal in quantity\r\nis therefore pressed away from the bottom of the column and flows off\r\nin the direction of the equator as an under current, the polar column\r\nat the same time sinking down one foot until equilibrium of the polar\r\nand equatorial columns is restored. Another foot of water now flows\r\ndown upon the polar column and another foot of water is displaced\r\nfrom below, causing, of course, the column to descend an additional\r\nfoot. The same process being continually repeated, a constant downward\r\nmotion of the polar column is the result. Or, perhaps, to express the\r\nmatter more accurately, owing to the constant flow of water from the\r\nequatorial regions down the slope, the weight of the polar column is\r\nkept always in excess of that of the equatorial; therefore the polar\r\ncolumn in the effort to restore equilibrium is kept in a constant state\r\nof descent. Hence he terms it a “vertical” circulation. The following\r\nwill show Dr. Carpenter’s theory in his own words:—\r\n\r\n“The action of cold on the surface water of each polar area will be\r\nexerted as follows:—\r\n\r\n“(_a_) In diminishing the height of the polar column as compared with\r\nthat of the equatorial, so that a lowering of its _level_ is produced,\r\nwhich can only be made good by a surface-flow from the latter towards\r\nthe former.\r\n\r\n“(_b_) In producing an excess in the downward _pressure_ of the column\r\nwhen this inflow has restored its level, in virtue of the increase of\r\nspecific gravity it has gained by its reduction in volume; whereby a\r\nportion of its heavy bottom-water is displaced laterally, causing a\r\nfurther reduction of level, which draws in a further supply of the\r\nwarmer and lighter water flowing towards its surface.\r\n\r\n“(_c_) In imparting a downward _movement_ to each new surface-stratum\r\nas its temperature undergoes reduction; so that the _entire column_ may\r\nbe said to be in a state of constant descent, like that which exists in\r\nthe water of a tall jar when an opening is made at its bottom, and the\r\nwater which flows away through it is replaced by an equivalent supply\r\npoured into the top of the jar” (§ 23).\r\n\r\nBut if this be his theory, as it evidently is, then the 4 foot-pounds\r\n(the amount of work performed by the descent of the water down the\r\nslope) comprehends all the work that gravitation can perform on a pound\r\nof water in making a complete circuit from the equator to the pole and\r\nfrom the pole back to the equator.\r\n\r\nThis, I trust, will be evident from the following considerations. When\r\na pound of water has flowed down from the equator to the pole, it has\r\ndescended 4 feet, and is then at the foot of the slope. Gravity has\r\ntherefore no more power to pull it down to a lower level. It will not\r\nsink through the polar water, for it is not denser than the water\r\nbeneath on which it rests. But it may be replied that although it will\r\nnot sink through the polar water, it has nevertheless made the polar\r\ncolumn heavier than the equatorial, and this excess of pressure forces\r\na pound of water out from beneath and allows the column to descend.\r\nSuppose it may be argued that a quantity of water flows down from the\r\nequator, so as to raise the level of the polar water by, say, one foot.\r\nThe polar column will now be rendered heavier than the equatorial by\r\nthe weight of one foot of water. The pressure of the one foot will\r\nthus force a quantity of water laterally from the bottom and cause the\r\nentire column to descend till the level of equilibrium is restored. In\r\nother words, the polar column will sink one foot. Now in the sinking of\r\nthis column work is performed by gravity. A certain amount of work is\r\nperformed by gravity in causing the water to flow down the slope from\r\nthe equator to the pole, and, in addition to this, a certain amount is\r\nperformed by gravity in the vertical descent of the column.\r\n\r\nI freely admit this to be sound reasoning, and admit that so much is\r\ndue to the slope and so much to the vertical descent of the water. But\r\nhere we come to the most important point, viz., is there the full slope\r\nof 4 feet and an additional vertical movement? Dr. Carpenter seems\r\nto conclude that there is, and that this vertical force is something\r\nin addition to the force which I derive from the slope. And here, I\r\nventure to think, is a radical error into which he has fallen in regard\r\nto the whole matter. Let it be observed that, when water circulates\r\nfrom difference of specific gravity, this vertical movement is just as\r\nreal a part of the process as the flow down the slope; but the point\r\nwhich I maintain is that _there is no additional power derived from\r\nthis vertical movement over and above what is derived from the full\r\nslope_—or, in other words, that this _primum mobile_, which he says I\r\nhave overlooked, has in reality no existence.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the following diagram will help to make the point still\r\nclearer:—\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 1.]\r\n\r\nLet P (fig. 1) be the surface of the ocean at the pole, and E the\r\nsurface at the equator; P O a column of water at the pole, and E Q a\r\ncolumn at the equator. The two columns are of equal weight, and balance\r\neach other; but as the polar water is colder, and consequently denser\r\nthan the equatorial, the polar column is shorter than the equatorial,\r\nthe difference in the length of the two columns being 4 feet. The\r\nsurface of the ocean at the equator E is 4 feet higher than the surface\r\nof the ocean at the pole P; there is therefore a slope of 4 feet from E\r\nto P. The molecules of water at E tend to flow down this slope towards\r\nP. The amount of work performed by gravity in the descent of a pound of\r\nwater down this slope from E to P is therefore 4 foot-pounds.\r\n\r\nBut of course there can be no permanent circulation while the full\r\nslope remains. In order to have circulation the polar column must be\r\nheavier than the equatorial. But any addition to the weight of the\r\npolar column is at the expense of the slope. In proportion as the\r\nweight of the polar column increases the less becomes the slope. This,\r\nhowever, makes no difference in the amount of work performed by gravity.\r\n\r\nSuppose now that water has flowed down till an addition of one foot\r\nof water is made to the polar column, and the difference of level,\r\nof course, diminished by one foot. The surface of the ocean in this\r\ncase will now be represented by the dotted line P′ E, and the slope\r\nreduced from 4 feet to 3 feet. Let us then suppose a pound of water to\r\nleave E and flow down to P′; 3 foot-pounds will be the amount of work\r\nperformed. The polar column being now too heavy by the extent of the\r\nmass of water P′ P one foot thick, its extra pressure causes a mass of\r\nwater equal to P′ P to flow off laterally from the bottom of the column.\r\nThe column therefore sinks down one foot till P′ reaches P. Now the\r\npound of water in this vertical descent from P′ to P has one foot-pound\r\nof work performed on it by gravity; this added to the 3 foot-pounds\r\nderived from the slope, gives a total of 4 foot-pounds in passing from\r\nE to P′ and then from P′ to P. This is the same amount of work that\r\nwould have been performed had it descended directly from E to P. In\r\nlike manner it can be proved that 4 foot-pounds is the amount of work\r\nperformed in the descent of every pound of water of the mass P′ P. The\r\nfirst pound which left E flowed down the slope directly to P, and\r\nperformed 4 foot-pounds of work. The last pound flowed down the slope E\r\nP′, and performed only 3 foot-pounds; but in descending from P′ to P it\r\nperformed the other one foot-pound. A pound leaving at a period exactly\r\nintermediate between the two flowed down 3½ feet of slope and descended\r\nvertically half a foot. Whatever path a pound of water might take, by\r\nthe time that it reached P, 4 foot-pounds of work would be performed.\r\nBut no further work can be performed after it reaches P.\r\n\r\nBut some will ask, in regard to the vertical movement, is it only in\r\nthe descent of the water from P′ to P that work is performed? Water\r\ncannot descend from P′ to P, it will be urged, unless the entire column\r\nP O underneath descend also. But the column P O descends by means of\r\ngravity. Why, then, it will be asked, is not the descent of the column\r\na motive power as real as the descent of the mass of water P′ P?\r\n\r\nThat neither force nor energy can be derived from the mere descent of\r\nthe polar column P O is demonstrable thus:—The reason why the column P\r\nO descends is because, in consequence of the mass of water P′ P resting\r\non it, its weight is in excess of the equatorial column E Q. But the\r\nforce with which the column descends is equal, not to the weight of\r\nthe column, but to the weight of the mass P′ P; consequently as much\r\nwork would be performed by gravity in the descent of the mass P′ P (the\r\none foot of water) alone as in the descent of the entire column P′ O,\r\n10,000 feet in height. Suppose a ton weight is placed in each scale of\r\na balance: the two scales balance each other. Place a pound weight in\r\none of the scales along with the ton weight and the scale will descend.\r\nBut it descends, not with the pressure of a ton and a pound, but with\r\nthe pressure of the pound weight only. In the descent of the scale,\r\nsay, one foot, gravity can perform only one foot-pound of work. In like\r\nmanner, in the descent of the polar column, the only work available is\r\nthe work of the mass P′ P laid on the top of the column. But it must be\r\nobserved that in the descent of the column from P′ to P, a distance of\r\none foot, each pound of water of the mass P′ P does not perform one\r\nfoot-pound of work; for the moment that a molecule of water reaches P,\r\nit then ceases to perform further work. The molecules at the surface P′\r\ndescend one foot before reaching P; the molecules midway between P′ and\r\nP descend only half a foot before reaching P, and the molecules at the\r\nbottom of the mass are already at P, and therefore cannot perform any\r\nwork. The mean distance through which the entire mass performs work is\r\ntherefore half a foot. One foot-pound per pound of water represents in\r\nthis case the amount of work derived from the vertical movement.\r\n\r\nThat such is the case is further evident from the following\r\nconsiderations. Before the polar column begins to descend, it is\r\nheavier than the equatorial by the weight of one foot of water; but\r\nwhen the column has descended half a foot, the polar column is heavier\r\nthan the equatorial by the weight of only half a foot of water; and,\r\nas the column continues to descend, the force with which it descends\r\ncontinues to diminish, and when it has sunk to P the force is zero.\r\nConsequently the mean pressure or weight with which the one foot of\r\nwater P′ P descended was equal to that of a layer of half a foot of\r\nwater; in other words, each pound of water, taking the mass as a whole,\r\ndescended with the pressure or weight of half a pound. But a half\r\npound descending one foot performs half a foot-pound; so that whether\r\nwe consider the _full pressure acting through the mean distance, or\r\nthe mean pressure acting through the full distance, we get the same\r\nresult_, viz. a half foot-pound as the work of vertical descent.\r\n\r\nNow it will be found, as we shall presently see, that if we calculate\r\nthe mean amount of work performed in descending the slope from the\r\nequator to the pole, 3½ foot-pounds per pound of water is the amount.\r\nThe water at the bottom of the mass P P′ moved, of course, down the\r\nfull slope E P 4 feet. The water at the top of the mass which descended\r\nfrom E to P′ descended a slope of only 3 feet. The mean descent of the\r\nwhole mass is therefore 3½ feet. And this gives 3½ foot-pounds as the\r\nmean amount of work per pound of water in descending the slope; this,\r\nadded to the half foot-pound derived from vertical descent, gives 4\r\nfoot-pounds as the total amount of work per pound of the mass.\r\n\r\nI have in the above reasoning supposed one foot of water accumulated\r\non the polar column before any vertical descent takes place. It is\r\nneedless to remark that the same conclusion would have been arrived\r\nat, viz., that the total amount of work performed is 4 foot-pounds per\r\npound of water, supposing we had considered 2 feet, or 3 feet, or even\r\n4 feet of water to have accumulated on the polar column before vertical\r\nmotion took place.\r\n\r\nI have also, in agreement with Dr. Carpenter’s mode of representing\r\nthe operation, been considering the two effects, viz., the flowing of\r\nthe water down the slope and the vertical descent of the polar column\r\nas taking place alternately. In nature, however, the two effects take\r\nplace simultaneously; but it is needless to add that the amount of work\r\nperformed would be the same whether the effects took place alternately\r\nor simultaneously.\r\n\r\nI have also represented the level of the ocean at the equator as\r\nremaining permanent while the alterations of level were taking place at\r\nthe pole. But in representing the operation as it would actually take\r\nplace in nature, we should consider the equatorial column to be lowered\r\nas the polar one is being raised. We should, for example, consider the\r\none foot of water P′ P put upon the polar column as so much taken off\r\nthe equatorial column. But in viewing the problem thus we arrive at\r\nexactly the same results as before.\r\n\r\nLet P (Fig. 2), as in Fig. 1, be the surface of the ocean at the pole,\r\nand E the surface at the equator, there being a slope of 4 feet from E\r\nto P. Suppose now a quantity of water, E E′, say, one foot thick, to\r\nflow from off the equatorial regions down upon the polar. It will thus\r\nlower the level of the equatorial column by one foot, and raise the\r\nlevel of the polar column by the same amount. I may, however, observe\r\nthat the one foot of water in passing from E to P would have its\r\ntemperature reduced from 80° to 32°, and this would produce a slight\r\ncontraction. But as the weight of the mass would not be affected, in\r\norder to simplify our reasoning we may leave this contraction out of\r\nconsideration. Any one can easily satisfy himself that the assumption\r\nthat E E′ is equal to P′ P does not in any way affect the question at\r\nissue—the only effect of the contraction being to _increase_ by an\r\ninfinitesimal amount the work done in descending the slope, and to\r\n_diminish_ by an equally infinitesimal amount the work done in the\r\nvertical descent. If, for example, 3 foot-pounds represent the amount\r\nof work performed in descending the slope, and one foot-pound the\r\namount performed in the vertical descent, on the supposition that E′ E\r\ndoes not contract in passing to the pole, then 3·0024 foot-pounds will\r\nrepresent the work of the slope, and 0·9976 foot-pounds the work of\r\nvertical descent when allowance is made for the contraction. But the\r\ntotal amount of work performed is the same in both cases. Consequently,\r\nto simplify our reasoning, we may be allowed to assume P′ P to be equal\r\nto E E′.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 2.]\r\n\r\nThe slope E P being 4 feet, the slope E′ P′ is consequently 2 feet;\r\nthe mean slope for the entire mass is therefore 3 feet. The mean\r\namount of work performed by the descent of the mass will of course\r\nbe 3 foot-pounds per pound of water. The amount of work performed by\r\nthe vertical descent of P′ P ought therefore to be one foot-pound per\r\npound. That this is the amount will be evident thus:—The transference\r\nof the one foot of water from the equatorial column to the polar\r\ndisturbs the equilibrium by making the equatorial column too light by\r\none foot of water and the polar column too heavy by the same amount of\r\nwater. The polar column will therefore tend to sink, and the equatorial\r\nto rise till equilibrium is restored. The difference of weight of\r\nthe two columns being equal to 2 feet of water, the polar column\r\nwill begin to descend with a pressure of 2 feet of water; and the\r\nequatorial column will begin to rise with an equal amount of pressure.\r\nWhen the polar column has descended half a foot the equatorial column\r\nwill have risen half a foot. The pressure of the descending polar\r\ncolumn will now be reduced to one foot of water. And when the polar\r\ncolumn has descended another foot, P′ will have reached P, and E′\r\nwill have reached E; the two columns will then be in equilibrium. It\r\ntherefore follows that the mean pressure with which the polar column\r\ndescended the one foot was equal to the pressure of one foot of water.\r\nConsequently the mean amount of work performed by the descent of the\r\nmass was equal to one foot-pound per pound of water; this, added to the\r\n3 foot-pounds derived from the slope, gives a total of 4 foot-pounds.\r\n\r\nIn whatever way we view the question, we are led to the conclusion that\r\nif 4 feet represent the amount of slope between the equatorial and\r\npolar columns when the two are in equilibrium, then 4 foot-pounds is\r\nthe total amount of work that gravity can perform upon a pound of water\r\nin overcoming the resistance to motion in its passage from the equator\r\nto the pole down the slope, and then in its vertical descent to the\r\nbottom of the ocean.\r\n\r\nBut it will be replied, not only does the one foot of water P′ P\r\ndescend, but the entire column P O, 10,000 feet in length, descends\r\nalso. What, then, it will be asked, becomes of the force which gravity\r\nexerts in the descent of this column? We shall shortly see that this\r\nforce is entirely applied in work against gravity in other parts of\r\nthe circuit; so that not a single foot-pound of this force goes to\r\novercome cohesion, friction, and other resistances; it is all spent in\r\ncounteracting the efforts which gravity exerts to stop the current in\r\nanother part of the circuit.\r\n\r\nI shall now consider the next part of the movement, viz., the under\r\nor return current from the bottom of the polar to the bottom of the\r\nequatorial column. What produces this current? It is needless to say\r\nthat it cannot be caused directly by gravity. Gravitation cannot\r\ndirectly draw any body horizontally along the earth’s surface. The\r\nwater that forms this current is pressed out laterally by the weight\r\nof the polar column, and flows, or rather is pushed, towards the\r\nequator to supply the vacancy caused by the ascent of the equatorial\r\ncolumn. There is a constant flow of water from the equator to the poles\r\nalong the surface, and this draining of the water from the equator is\r\nsupplied by the under or return current from the poles. But the only\r\npower which can impel the water from the bottom of the polar column\r\nto the bottom of the equatorial column is the pressure of the polar\r\ncolumn. But whence does the polar column derive its pressure? It can\r\nonly press to the extent that its weight exceeds that of the equatorial\r\ncolumn. That which exerts the pressure is therefore the mass of water\r\nwhich has flowed down the slope from the equator upon the polar column.\r\nIt is in this case the vertical movement that causes this under\r\ncurrent. The energy which produces this current must consequently be\r\nderived from the 4 foot-pounds resulting from the slope; for the energy\r\nof the vertical movement, as has already been proved, is derived from\r\nthis source; or, in other words, whatever power this vertical movement\r\nmay exert is so much deducted from the 4 foot-pounds derived from the\r\nfull slope.\r\n\r\nLet us now consider the fourth and last movement, viz., the ascent of\r\nthe under current to the surface of the ocean at the equator. When\r\nthis cold under current reaches the equatorial regions, it ascends\r\nto the surface to the point whence it originally started on its\r\ncircuit. What, then, lifts the water from the bottom of the equatorial\r\ncolumn to its top? This cannot be done directly, either by heat or\r\nby gravity. When heat, for example, is applied to the bottom of a\r\nvessel, the heated water at the bottom expands and, becoming lighter\r\nthan the water above, rises through it to the surface; but if the\r\nheat be applied to the surface of the water instead of to the bottom,\r\nthe heat will not produce an ascending current. It will tend rather\r\nto prevent such a current than to produce one—the reason being that\r\neach successive layer of water will, on account of the heat applied,\r\nbecome hotter and consequently lighter than the layer below it, and\r\ncolder and consequently heavier than the layer above it. It therefore\r\ncannot ascend, because it is too heavy; nor can it descend, because\r\nit is too light. But the sea in equatorial regions is heated from\r\nabove, and not from below; consequently the water at the bottom does\r\nnot rise to the surface at the equator in virtue of any heat which it\r\nreceives. A layer of water can never raise the temperature of a layer\r\nbelow it to a higher temperature than itself; and since it cannot do\r\nthis, it cannot make the layer under it lighter than itself. That which\r\nraises the water at the equator, according to Dr. Carpenter’s theory,\r\nmust be the downward pressure of the polar column. When water flows\r\ndown the slope from the equator to the pole, the polar column, as we\r\nhave seen, becomes too heavy and the equatorial column too light;\r\nthe former then sinks and the latter rises. It is the sinking of the\r\npolar column which raises the equatorial one. When the polar column\r\ndescends, as much water is pressed in underneath the equatorial column\r\nas is pressed from underneath the polar column. If one foot of water\r\nis pressed from under the polar column, a foot of water is pressed in\r\nunder the equatorial column. Thus, when the polar column sinks a foot,\r\nthe equatorial column rises to the same extent. The equatorial water\r\ncontinuing to flow down the slope, the polar column descends: a foot\r\nof water is again pressed from underneath the polar column and a foot\r\npressed in under the equatorial. As foot after foot is thus removed\r\nfrom the bottom of the polar column while it sinks, foot after foot is\r\npushed in under the equatorial column while it rises; so by this means\r\nthe water at the surface of the ocean in polar regions descends to\r\nthe bottom, and the water at the bottom in equatorial regions ascends\r\nto the surface—the effect of solar heat and polar cold continuing, of\r\ncourse, to maintain the surface of the ocean in equatorial regions at a\r\nhigher level than at the poles, and thus keeping up a constant state of\r\ndisturbed equilibrium. Or, to state the matter in Dr. Carpenter’s own\r\nwords, “The cold and dense polar water, as it flows in at the bottom of\r\nthe equatorial column, will not directly take the place of that which\r\nhas been drafted off from the surface; but this place will be filled\r\nby the rising of the whole superincumbent column, which, being warmer,\r\nis also lighter than the cold stratum beneath. Every new arrival from\r\nthe poles will take its place below that which precedes it, since its\r\ntemperature will have been less affected by contact with the warmer\r\nwater above it. In this way an ascending movement will be imparted to\r\nthe whole equatorial column, and in due course every portion of it will\r\ncome under the influence of the surface-heat of the sun.”[73]\r\n\r\nBut the agency which raises up the water of the under current to the\r\nsurface is the pressure of the polar column. The equatorial column\r\ncannot rise directly by means of gravity. Gravity, instead of raising\r\nthe column, exerts all its powers to prevent its rising. Gravity\r\nhere is a force acting against the current. It is the descent of\r\nthe polar column, as has been stated, that raises the equatorial\r\ncolumn. Consequently the entire amount of work performed by gravity\r\nin pulling down the polar column is spent in raising the equatorial\r\ncolumn. Gravity performs exactly as much work in preventing motion\r\nin the equatorial column as it performs in producing motion in the\r\npolar column; so that, so far as the vertical parts of Dr. Carpenter’s\r\ncirculation are concerned, gravity may be said neither to produce\r\nmotion nor to prevent it. And this remark, be it observed, applies not\r\nonly to P O and E Q, but also to the parts P′ P and E E′ of the two\r\ncolumns. When a mass of water E E′, say one foot deep, is removed off\r\nthe equatorial column and placed upon the polar column, the latter\r\ncolumn is then heavier than the former by the weight of two feet of\r\nwater. Gravity then exerts more force in pulling the polar column down\r\nthan it does in preventing the equatorial column from rising; and\r\nthe consequence is that the polar column begins to descend and the\r\nequatorial column to rise. But as the polar column continues to descend\r\nand the equatorial to rise, the power of gravity to produce motion in\r\nthe polar column diminishes, and the power of gravity to prevent motion\r\nin the equatorial column increases; and when P′ descends to P and E′\r\nrises to E, the power of gravity to prevent motion in the equatorial\r\ncolumn is exactly equal to the power of gravity to produce motion in\r\nthe polar column, and consequently motion ceases. It therefore follows\r\nthat the entire amount of work performed by the descent of P′ P is\r\nspent in raising E′ E against gravity.\r\n\r\nIt follows also that inequalities in the sea-bottom cannot in any\r\nway aid the circulation; for although the cold under current should\r\nin its progress come to a deep trough filled with water less dense\r\nthan itself, it would no doubt sink to the bottom of the hollow; yet\r\nbefore it could get out again as much work would have to be performed\r\nagainst gravity as was performed by gravity in sinking it. But whilst\r\ninequalities in the bed of the ocean would not aid the current, they\r\nwould nevertheless very considerably retard it by the obstructions\r\nwhich they would offer to the motion of the water.\r\n\r\nWe have been assuming that the weight of P′ P is equal to that of E E′;\r\nbut the mass P′ P must be greater than E E′ because P′ P has not only\r\nto raise E E′, but to impel the under current—to push the water along\r\nthe sea-bottom from the pole to the equator. So we must have a mass of\r\nwater, in addition to P′ P, placed on the polar column to enable it to\r\nproduce the under current in addition to the raising of the equatorial\r\ncolumn.\r\n\r\nIt follows also that the amount of work which can be performed by\r\ngravity depends entirely on the _difference_ of temperature between\r\nthe equatorial and the polar waters, and is wholly independent of the\r\nway in which the temperature may decrease from the equator to the\r\npoles. Suppose, in agreement with Dr. Carpenter’s idea,[74] that the\r\nequatorial heat and polar cold should be confined to limited areas, and\r\nthat through the intermediate space no great difference of temperature\r\nshould prevail. Such an arrangement as this would not increase the\r\namount of work which gravity could perform; it would simply make the\r\nslope steeper at the two extremes and flatter in the intervening space.\r\nIt would no doubt aid the surface-flow of the water near the equator\r\nand the poles, but it would retard in a corresponding degree the flow\r\nof the water in the intermediate regions. In short, it would merely\r\ndestroy the uniformity of the slope without aiding in the least degree\r\nthe general motion of the water.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore demonstrable that _the energy derived from the full\r\nslope, whatever that slope may be, comprehends all that can possibly be\r\nobtained from gravity_.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be urged as an objection to what has been advanced that I\r\nhave determined simply the amount of the force acting on the water at\r\nthe surface of the ocean and not that on the water at all depths—that I\r\nhave estimated the amount of work which gravity can perform on a given\r\nquantity of water at the surface, but not the total amount of work\r\nwhich gravity can perform on the entire ocean. This objection will not\r\nstand, because it is at the surface of the ocean where the greatest\r\ndifference of temperature, and consequently of density, exists between\r\nthe equatorial and polar waters, and therefore there that gravity\r\nexerts its greatest force. And if gravity be unable to move the water\r\nat the surface, it is much less able to do so under the surface. So\r\nfar as the question at issue is concerned, any calculations as to the\r\namount of force exerted by gravity at various depths are needless.\r\n\r\nIt is maintained also that the winds cannot produce a vertical current\r\nexcept under some very peculiar conditions. We have already seen that,\r\naccording to Dr. Carpenter’s theory, the vertical motion is caused\r\nby the water flowing off the equatorial column, down the slope, upon\r\nthe polar column, thus destroying the equilibrium between the two by\r\ndiminishing the weight of the equatorial column and increasing that of\r\nthe polar column. In order that equilibrium may be restored, the polar\r\ncolumn sinks and the equatorial one rises. Now must not the same effect\r\noccur, supposing the water to be transferred from the one column to\r\nthe other, by the influence of the winds instead of by the influence\r\nof gravity? The vertical descent and ascent of these columns depend\r\nentirely upon the difference in their weights, and not upon the nature\r\nof the agency which makes this difference. So far as difference of\r\nweight is concerned, 2 feet of water, propelled down the slope from the\r\nequatorial column to the polar by the winds, will produce just the same\r\neffect as though it had been propelled by gravity. If vertical motion\r\nfollows as a necessary consequence from a transference of water from\r\nthe equator to the poles by gravity, it follows equally as a necessary\r\nconsequence from the same transference by the winds; so that one is not\r\nat liberty to advocate a vertical circulation in the one case and to\r\ndeny it in the other.\r\n\r\n_Gravitation Theory of the Gibraltar Current._—If difference of\r\nspecific gravity fails to account for the currents of the ocean in\r\ngeneral, it certainly fails in a still more decided manner to account\r\nfor the Gibraltar current. The existence of the submarine ridge\r\nbetween Capes Trafalgar and Spartel, as was shown in the Phil. Mag.\r\nfor October, 1871, p. 269, affects currents resulting from difference\r\nof specific gravity in a manner which does not seem to have suggested\r\nitself to Dr. Carpenter. The pressure of water and other fluids is\r\nnot like that of a solid—not like that of the weight in the scale of\r\na balance, simply a downward pressure. Fluids press downwards like\r\nthe solids, but they also press laterally. The pressure of water is\r\nhydrostatic. If we fill a basin with water or any other fluid, the\r\nfluid remains in perfect equilibrium, provided the sides of the basin\r\nbe sufficiently strong to resist the pressure. The Mediterranean and\r\nAtlantic, up to the level of the submarine ridge referred to, may be\r\nregarded as huge basins, the sides of which are sufficiently strong to\r\nresist all pressure. It follows that, however much denser the water\r\nof the Mediterranean may be than that of the Atlantic, it is only the\r\nwater above the level of the ridge that can possibly exercise any\r\ninfluence in the way of disturbing equilibrium, so as to cause the\r\nlevel of the Mediterranean to stand lower than that of the Atlantic.\r\nThe water of the Atlantic below the level of this ridge might be as\r\nlight as air, and that of the Mediterranean as heavy as molten lead,\r\nbut this could produce no disturbance of equilibrium; and if there be\r\nno difference of density between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean\r\nwaters from the surface down to the level of the top of the ridge, then\r\nthere can be nothing to produce the circulation which Dr. Carpenter\r\ninfers. Suppose both basins empty, and dense water to be poured into\r\nthe Mediterranean, and water less dense into the Atlantic, until they\r\nare both filled up to the level of the ridge, it is evident that the\r\nheavier water in the one basin can exercise no influence in raising\r\nthe level of the lighter water in the other basin, the entire pressure\r\nbeing borne by the sides of the basins. But if we continue to pour in\r\nwater till the surface is raised, say one foot, above the level of the\r\nridge, then there is nothing to resist the lateral pressure of this one\r\nfoot of water in the Mediterranean but the counter pressure of the one\r\nfoot in the Atlantic. But as the Mediterranean water is denser than the\r\nAtlantic, this one foot of water will consequently exert more pressure\r\nthan the one foot of water of the Atlantic. We must therefore continue\r\nto pour more water into the Atlantic until its lateral pressure equals\r\nthat of the Mediterranean. The two seas will then be in equilibrium,\r\nbut the surface of the Atlantic will of course be at a higher level\r\nthan the surface of the Mediterranean. The difference of level will be\r\nproportionate to the difference in density of the waters of the two\r\nseas. But here we come to the point of importance. In determining the\r\ndifference of level between the two seas, or, which is the same thing,\r\nthe difference of level between a column of the Atlantic and a column\r\nof the Mediterranean, we must take into consideration _only the water\r\nwhich lies above the level of the ridge_. If there be one foot of water\r\nabove the ridge, then there is a difference of level proportionate to\r\nthe difference of pressure between the one foot of water of the two\r\nseas. If there be 2 feet, 3 feet, or any number of feet of water above\r\nthe level of the ridge, the difference of level is proportionate to\r\nthe 2 feet, 3 feet, or whatever number of feet there may be of water\r\nabove the ridge. If, for example, 13 should represent the density of\r\nthe Mediterranean water and 12 the density of the Atlantic water, then\r\nif there were one foot of water in the Mediterranean above the level of\r\nthe ridge, there would require to be one foot one inch of water in the\r\nAtlantic above the ridge in order that the two might be in equilibrium.\r\nThe difference of level would therefore be one inch. If there were 2\r\nfeet of water, the difference of level would be 2 inches; if 3 feet,\r\nthe difference would be 3 inches, and so on. And this would follow,\r\nno matter what the actual depth of the two basins might be; the water\r\nbelow the level of the ridge exercising no influence whatever on the\r\nlevel of the surface.\r\n\r\nTaking Dr. Carpenter’s own data as to the density of the Mediterranean\r\nand Atlantic waters, what, then, is the difference of density? The\r\nsubmarine ridge comes to within 167 fathoms of the surface; say, in\r\nround numbers, to within 1,000 feet. What are the densities of the two\r\nbasins down to the depth of 1,000 feet? According to Dr. Carpenter\r\nthere is little, if any, difference. His own words on this point are\r\nthese:—“A comparison of these results leaves no doubt that there is\r\nan excess of salinity in the water of the Mediterranean above that of\r\nthe Atlantic; but that this excess _is_ slight in the surface-water,\r\nwhilst somewhat greater in the deeper water” (§ 7). “Again, it was\r\nfound by examining samples of water taken from the surface, from 100\r\nfathoms, from 250 fathoms, and from 400 fathoms respectively, that\r\nwhilst the _first two_ had the _characteristic temperature and density\r\nof Atlantic water_, the last two had the characteristics and density of\r\nMediterranean water” (§ 13). Here, at least to the depth of 100 fathoms\r\nor 600 feet, there is little difference of density between the waters\r\nof the two basins. Consequently down to the depth of 600 feet, there is\r\nnothing to produce any sensible disturbance of equilibrium. If there\r\nbe any sensible disturbance of equilibrium, it must be in consequence\r\nof difference of density which may exist between the depths of 600\r\nfeet and the surface of the ridge. We have nothing to do with any\r\ndifference which may exist between the water of the Mediterranean and\r\nthe Atlantic below the ridge; the water in the Mediterranean basin may\r\nbe as heavy as mercury below 1,000 feet: but this can have no effect\r\nin disturbing equilibrium. The water to the depth of 600 feet being of\r\nthe same density in both seas, the length of the two columns acting on\r\neach other is therefore reduced to 400 feet—that is, to that stratum of\r\nwater lying at a depth of from 600 to the surface of the ridge 1,000\r\nfeet below the surface. But, to give the theory full justice, we shall\r\ntake the Mediterranean stratum at the density of the deep water of\r\nthe Mediterranean, which he found to be about 1·029, and the density\r\nof the Atlantic stratum at 1·026. The difference of density between\r\nthe two columns is therefore ·003. Consequently, if the height of the\r\nMediterranean column be 400 feet, it will be balanced by the Atlantic\r\ncolumn of 401·2 feet; the difference of level between the Mediterranean\r\nand the Atlantic cannot therefore be more than 1·2 foot. The amount\r\nof work that can be performed by gravity in the case of the Gibraltar\r\ncurrent is little more than one foot-pound per pound of water, an\r\namount of energy evidently inadequate to produce the current.\r\n\r\nIt is true that in his last expedition Dr. Carpenter found the\r\nbottom-water on the ridge somewhat denser than Atlantic water at the\r\nsame depth, the former being 1·0292 and the latter 1·0265; but it\r\nalso proved to be denser than Mediterranean water at the same depth.\r\nHe found, for example, that “the dense Mediterranean water lies about\r\n100 fathoms nearer the surface over a 300-fathoms bottom, than it\r\ndoes where the bottom sinks to more than 500 fathoms” (§ 51). But any\r\nexcess of density which might exist at the ridge could have no tendency\r\nwhatever to make the Mediterranean column preponderate over the\r\nAtlantic column, any more than could a weight placed over the fulcrum\r\nof a balance have a tendency to make the one scale weigh down the other.\r\n\r\nIf the objection referred to be sound, it shows the mechanical\r\nimpossibility of the theory. It proves that whether there be an under\r\ncurrent or not, or whether the dense water lying in the deep trough of\r\nthe Mediterranean be carried over the submarine ridge into the Atlantic\r\nor not, the explanation offered by Dr. Carpenter is one which cannot be\r\nadmitted. It is incumbent on him to explain either (1) how the almost\r\ninfinitesimal difference of density which exists between the Atlantic\r\nand Mediterranean columns down to the level of the ridge can produce\r\nthe upper and under currents carrying the deep and dense water of\r\nthe Mediterranean over the ridge, or (2) how all this can be done by\r\nmeans of the difference of density which exists below the level of the\r\nridge.[75] What the true cause of the Gibraltar current really is will\r\nbe considered in Chap. XIII.\r\n\r\n_The Baltic Current._—The entrance to the Baltic Sea is in some\r\nplaces not over 50 or 60 feet deep. It follows, therefore, from what\r\nhas already been proved in regard to the Gibraltar current, that the\r\ninfluence of gravity must be even still less in causing a current in\r\nthe Baltic strait than in the Gibraltar strait.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n   EXAMINATION OF THE GRAVITATION THEORY OF OCEANIC CIRCULATION.—DR.\r\n              CARPENTER’S THEORY.—OBJECTIONS CONSIDERED.\r\n\r\n  _Modus Operandi_ of the Matter.—Polar Cold considered by Dr.\r\n      Carpenter the _Primum Mobile_.—Supposed Influence of\r\n      Heat derived from the Earth’s Crust.—Circulation without\r\n      Difference of Level.—A Confusion of Ideas in Reference to the\r\n      supposed Agency of Polar Cold.—M. Dubuat’s Experiments.—A\r\n      Begging of the Question at Issue.—Pressure as a Cause of\r\n      Circulation.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing chapter, the substance of which appeared in the\r\nPhil. Mag. for October, 1871, I have represented the manner in which\r\ndifference of specific gravity produces circulation. But Dr. Carpenter\r\nappears to think that there are some important points which I have\r\noverlooked. These I shall now proceed to consider in detail.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Croll’s whole manner of treating the subject,” he says, “is so\r\ndifferent from that which it appears to me to require, and he has so\r\ncompletely misapprehended my own view of the question, that I feel it\r\nrequisite to present this in fuller detail in order that physicists and\r\nmathematicians, having both sides fully before them, may judge between\r\nus” (§ 26).[76]\r\n\r\nHe then refers to a point so obvious as hardly to require\r\nconsideration, viz., the effect which results when the surface of\r\nthe entire area of a lake or pond of water is cooled. The whole of\r\nthe surface-film, being chilled at the same time, sinks through the\r\nsubjacent water, and a new film from the warmer layer immediately\r\nbeneath the surface rises into its place. This being cooled in its\r\nturn, sinks, and so on. He next considers what takes place when only\r\na portion of the surface of the pond is cooled, and shows that in this\r\ncase the surface-film which descends is replaced not from beneath, but\r\nby an inflow from the neighbouring area.\r\n\r\n“That such must be the case,” says Dr. Carpenter, “appears to me so\r\nself-evident that I am surprised that any person conversant with the\r\nprinciples of physical science should hesitate in admitting it, still\r\nmore that he should explicitly deny it. But since others may feel the\r\nsame difficulty as Mr. Croll, it may be worth while for me to present\r\nthe case in a form of yet more elementary simplicity” (§ 29).\r\n\r\nThen, in order to show the mode in which the general oceanic\r\ncirculation takes place, he supposes two cylindrical vessels, W and\r\nC, of equal size, to be filled with sea-water. Cylinder W represents\r\nthe equatorial column, and the water contained in it has its\r\ntemperature maintained at 60°; whilst the water in the other cylinder\r\nC, representing the polar column, has its temperature maintained at\r\n30° by means of the constant application of cold at the top. Free\r\ncommunication is maintained between the two cylinders at top and\r\nbottom; and the water in the cold cylinder being, in virtue of its\r\nlow temperature, denser than the water in the warm cylinder, the two\r\ncolumns are therefore not in static equilibrium. The cold, and hence\r\nheavier column tends to produce an outflow of water from its bottom to\r\nthe bottom of the warm column, which outflow is replaced by an inflow\r\nfrom the top of the warm column to the top of the cold column. In fact,\r\nwe have just a simple repetition of what he has given over and over\r\nagain in his various memoirs on the subject. But why so repeatedly\r\nenter into the _modus operandi_ of the matter? Who feels any difficulty\r\nin understanding how the circulation is produced?\r\n\r\n_Polar Cold considered by Dr. Carpenter the Primum Mobile._—It is\r\nevident that Dr. Carpenter believes that he has found in polar _cold_\r\nan agency the potency of which, in producing a general oceanic\r\ncirculation, has been overlooked by physicists; and it is with the view\r\nof developing his ideas on this subject that he has entered so fully\r\nand so frequently into the exposition of his theory. “If I have myself\r\ndone anything,” he says, “to strengthen the doctrine, it has been by\r\nshowing that polar cold, rather than equatorial heat, is the _primum\r\nmobile_ of this circulation.”[77]\r\n\r\nThe influence of the sun in heating the waters of the inter-tropical\r\nseas is, in Dr. Carpenter’s manner of viewing the problem, of no\r\ngreat importance. The efficient cause of motion he considers resides\r\nin _cold_ rather than in _heat_. In fact, he even goes the length\r\nof maintaining that, as a power in the production of the general\r\ninterchange of equatorial and polar water, the effect of polar cold is\r\nso much superior to that of inter-tropical heat, that the influence of\r\nthe latter may be _practically disregarded_.\r\n\r\n“Suppose two basins of ocean-water,” he says, “connected by a strait to\r\nbe placed under such different climatic conditions that the surface of\r\none is exposed to the heating influence of tropical sunshine, whilst\r\nthe surface of the other is subjected to the extreme cold of the\r\nsunless polar winter. The effect of the surface-heat upon the water\r\nof the tropical basin will be for the most part limited (as I shall\r\npresently show) to its uppermost stratum, and may here be _practically\r\ndisregarded_.”[78]\r\n\r\nDr. Carpenter’s idea regarding the efficiency of cold in producing\r\nmotion seems to me to be not only opposed to the generally received\r\nviews on the subject, but wholly irreconcilable with the ordinary\r\nprinciples of mechanics. In fact, there are so many points on which\r\nDr. Carpenter’s theory of a “General _Vertical_ Oceanic Circulation”\r\ndiffers from the generally received views on the subject of circulation\r\nby means of difference of specific gravity, that I have thought it\r\nadvisable to enter somewhat minutely into the consideration of the\r\nmechanics of that theory, the more so as he has so repeatedly asserted\r\nthat eminent physicists agree with what he has advanced on the subject.\r\n\r\nAccording to the generally received theory, the circulation is due to\r\nthe _difference of density_ between the sea in equatorial and polar\r\nregions. The real efficient cause is gravity; but gravity cannot act\r\nwhen there is no difference of specific gravity. If the sea were of\r\nequal density from the poles to the equator, gravity could exercise no\r\ninfluence in the production of circulation; and the influence which it\r\ndoes possess is in proportion to the difference of density. But the\r\ndifference of density between equatorial and polar waters is in turn\r\ndue not absolutely either to polar cold or to tropical heat, but to\r\nboth—or, in other words, to the _difference_ of temperature between\r\nthe polar and equatorial seas. This difference, in the very nature of\r\nthings, must be as much the result of equatorial heat as of polar cold.\r\nIf the sea in equatorial regions were not being heated by the sun as\r\nrapidly as the sea in polar regions is being cooled, the difference of\r\ntemperature between them, and consequently the difference of density,\r\nwould be diminishing, and in course of time would disappear altogether.\r\nAs has already been shown, it is a necessary consequence that the\r\nwater flowing from equatorial to polar regions must be compensated by\r\nan equal amount flowing from polar to equatorial regions. Now, if the\r\nwater flowing from polar to equatorial regions were not being heated\r\nas rapidly as the water flowing from equatorial to polar regions is\r\nbeing cooled, the equatorial seas would gradually become colder and\r\ncolder until no sensible difference of temperature existed between\r\nthem and the polar oceans. In fact, _equality of the two rates_ is\r\nnecessary to the very existence of such a general circulation as that\r\nadvocated by Dr. Carpenter. If he admits that the general interchange\r\nof equatorial and polar water advocated by him is caused by the\r\ndifference of density between the water at the equator and the poles,\r\nresulting from difference of temperature, then he must admit also that\r\nthis difference of density is just as much due to the heating of the\r\nequatorial water by the sun as it is to the cooling of the polar water\r\nby radiation and other means—or, in other words, that it is as much due\r\nto equatorial heat as to polar cold. And if so, it cannot be true that\r\npolar cold rather than equatorial heat is the “_primum mobile_” of\r\nthis circulation; and far less can it be true that the heating of the\r\nequatorial water by the sun is of so little importance that it may be\r\n“practically disregarded.”\r\n\r\n_Supposed Influence of Heat derived from the Earth’s Crust._—There is,\r\naccording to Dr. Carpenter, another agent concerned in the production\r\nof the general oceanic circulation, viz., the heat derived by the\r\nbottom of the ocean from the crust of the earth.[79] We have no reason\r\nto believe that the quantity of internal heat coming through the\r\nearth’s crust is greater in one part of the globe than in another; nor\r\nhave we any grounds for concluding that the bottom of inter-tropical\r\nseas receives more heat from the earth’s crust than the bottom of those\r\nin polar regions. But if the polar seas receive as much heat from this\r\nsource as the seas within the tropics, then the difference of density\r\nbetween the two cannot possibly be due to heat received from the\r\nearth’s crust; and this being so, it is mechanically impossible that\r\ninternal heat can be a cause in the production of the general oceanic\r\ncirculation.\r\n\r\n_Circulation without Difference of Level._—There is another part of\r\nthe theory which appears to me irreconcilable with mechanics. It is\r\nmaintained that this general circulation takes place without any\r\ndifference of level between the equator and the poles. Referring to the\r\ncase of the two cylinders W and C, which represent the equatorial and\r\npolar columns respectively, Dr. Carpenter says:—\r\n\r\n“The force which will thus lift up the entire column of water in W\r\nis that which causes the descent of the entire column in C, namely,\r\nthe excess of gravity constantly acting in C,—the levels of the\r\ntwo columns, and consequently their heights, being maintained at a\r\n_constant equality_ by the free passage of surface-water from W to C.”\r\n\r\n“The whole of Mr. Croll’s discussion of this question, however,” he\r\ncontinues, “proceeds upon the assumption that the levels of the polar\r\nand equatorial columns are _not kept at an_ _equality_, &c.” (§ 30.)\r\nAnd again, “Now, so far from asserting (as Captain Maury has done) that\r\nthe trifling difference of level arising from inequality of temperature\r\nis adequate to the production of ocean-currents, I simply affirm that\r\nas fast as the level is disturbed by change of temperature it will be\r\nrestored by gravity.” (§ 23.)[80]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 3.]\r\n\r\nIn order to understand more clearly how the circulation under\r\nconsideration cannot take place without a difference of level, let W E\r\n(Fig. 3) represent the equatorial column, and C P the polar column. The\r\nequatorial column is warmer than the polar column because it receives\r\n_more_ heat from the sun than the latter; and the polar is colder\r\nthan the equatorial column because it receives _less_. The difference\r\nin the density of the two columns results from their difference of\r\ntemperature; and the difference of temperature results in turn from the\r\ndifference in the quantity of heat received from the sun by each. Or,\r\nto express the matter in other words, the difference of density (and\r\nconsequently the circulation under consideration) is due to the excess\r\nof heat received from the sun by the equatorial over that received by\r\nthe polar column; so that to leave out of account the super-heating of\r\nthe inter-tropical waters by the sun is to leave out of account the\r\nvery thing of all others that is absolutely essential to the existence\r\nof the circulation. The water being assumed to be the same in both\r\ncolumns and differing only as regards temperature, and the equatorial\r\ncolumn possessing more heat than the polar, and being therefore less\r\ndense than the latter, it follows, in order that the two columns may\r\nbe in static equilibrium, that the surface of the equatorial column\r\nmust stand at a higher level than that of the polar. This produces the\r\nslope W C from the equator to the pole. The extent of the slope will of\r\ncourse depend upon the extent of the difference of their temperatures.\r\nBut, as was shown on a former occasion,[81] it is impossible that\r\nstatic equilibrium can ever be fully obtained, because the slope\r\noccasioned by the elevation of the equatorial column above the polar\r\nproduces what we may be allowed to call a _molecular_ disturbance of\r\nequilibrium. The surface of the ocean, or the molecules of water lying\r\non the slope, are not in a position of equilibrium, but tend, in virtue\r\nof gravity, to roll down the slope in the direction of the polar column\r\nC. It will be observed that the more we gain of static equilibrium\r\nof the entire ocean the greater is the slope, and consequently the\r\ngreater is the disturbance of molecular equilibrium; and, _vice versâ_,\r\nthe more molecular equilibrium is restored by the reduction of the\r\nslope, the greater is the disturbance of static equilibrium. _It is\r\ntherefore absolutely impossible that both conditions of equilibrium can\r\nbe fulfilled at the same time so long as a difference of temperature\r\nexists between the two columns._ And this conclusion holds true even\r\nthough we should assume water to be a perfect fluid absolutely devoid\r\nof viscosity. It follows, therefore, that a general oceanic circulation\r\nwithout a difference of level is a _mechanical impossibility_.\r\n\r\nIn a case of actual circulation due to difference of gravity, there\r\nis always a constant disturbance of both _static_ and molecular\r\nequilibrium. Column C is always higher and column W always lower than\r\nit ought to be were the two in equilibrium; but they never can be at\r\nthe same level.\r\n\r\nIt is quite conceivable, of course, that the two conditions of\r\nequilibrium may be fulfilled alternately. We can conceive column C\r\nremaining stationary till the water flowing from column W has restored\r\nthe level. And after the level is restored we can conceive the polar\r\ncolumn C sinking and the equatorial column W rising till the two\r\nperfectly balance each other. Such a mode of circulation, consisting\r\nof an alternate surface-flow and vertical descent and ascent of the\r\ncolumns, though conceivable, is in reality impossible in nature; for\r\nthere are no means by which the polar column C could be supported\r\nfrom sinking till the level had been restored. But Dr. Carpenter does\r\nnot assume that the general oceanic circulation takes place in this\r\nintermitting manner; according to him, the circulation is _constant_.\r\nHe asserts that there is a “_continual_ transference of water from the\r\nbottom of C to the bottom of W, and from the top of W to the top of C,\r\nwith a _constant_ descending movement in C and a _constant_ ascending\r\nmovement in W” (§ 29). But such a condition of things is irreconcilable\r\nwith the idea of “the levels of the two columns, and consequently their\r\nheights, being maintained at a _constant_ equality” (§ 29).\r\n\r\nAlthough Dr. Carpenter does not admit the existence of a permanent\r\ndifference of level between the equator and the pole, he nevertheless\r\nspeaks of a depression of level in the polar basin resulting from the\r\ncontraction by cooling of the water flowing into it. This reduction of\r\nlevel induces an inflow of water from the surrounding area; “and since\r\nwhat is drawn away,” to quote his own words, “is supplied from a yet\r\ngreater distance, the continued cooling of the surface-stratum in the\r\npolar basin will cause a ‘set’ of waters towards it, to be propagated\r\nbackwards through the whole intervening ocean in communication with\r\nit until it reaches the tropical area.” The slope produced between\r\nthe polar basin and the surrounding area, if sufficiently great, will\r\nenable the water in the surrounding area to flow polewards; but unless\r\nthis slope extend to the equator, it will not enable the tropical\r\nwaters also to flow polewards. One of two things necessarily follows:\r\neither the slope extends from the equator to the pole, or water can\r\nflow from the equator to the pole without a slope. If Dr. Carpenter\r\nmaintains the former, he contradicts himself; and if he adopts the\r\nlatter, he contradicts an obvious principle of mechanics.\r\n\r\n_A Confusion of Ideas in Reference to the supposed Agency of Polar\r\nCold._—It seems to me that Dr. Carpenter has been somewhat misled by a\r\nslight confusion of ideas in reference to the supposed agency of polar\r\ncold. This is brought out forcibly in the following passage from his\r\nmemoir in the Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society, vol. xv.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Croll, in arguing against the doctrine of a general oceanic\r\ncirculation sustained by difference of temperature, and _justly\r\nmaintaining_ that such a circulation cannot be produced by the\r\napplication of heat at the surface, has entirely ignored the agency of\r\ncold.”\r\n\r\nIt is here supposed that there are two agents at work in the production\r\nof the general oceanic circulation. The one agent is _heat_, acting\r\nat the equatorial regions; and the other agent is _cold_, acting at\r\nthe polar regions. It is supposed that the agency of cold is far more\r\npowerful than that of heat. In fact so trifling is the agency of\r\nequatorial heat in comparison with that of polar cold that it may be\r\n“practically disregarded”—left out of account altogether,—polar cold\r\nbeing the _primum mobile_ of the circulation. It is supposed also that\r\nI have considered the efficiency of one of the agents, viz., heat, and\r\nfound it totally inadequate to produce the circulation in question; and\r\nit is admitted also that my conclusions are perfectly correct. But then\r\nI am supposed to have left out of account the other agent, viz., polar\r\ncold, the only agent possessing real potency. Had I taken into account\r\npolar cold, it is supposed that I should have found at once a cause\r\nperfectly adequate to produce the required effect.\r\n\r\nThis is a fair statement of Dr. Carpenter’s views on the subject; I am\r\nunable, at least, to attach any other meaning to his words. And I have\r\nno doubt they are also the views which have been adopted by those who\r\nhave accepted his theory.\r\n\r\nIt must be sufficiently evident from what has already been stated,\r\nthat the notion of there being two separate agents at work producing\r\ncirculation, namely heat and cold, the one of which is assumed to have\r\nmuch more potency than the other, is not only opposed to the views\r\nentertained by physicists, but is also wholly irreconcilable with the\r\nordinary principles of mechanics. But more than this, if we analyze the\r\nsubject a little so as to remove some of the confusion of ideas which\r\nbesets it, we shall find that these views are irreconcilable with even\r\nDr. Carpenter’s own explanation of the cause of the general oceanic\r\ncirculation.\r\n\r\n_Cold_ is not a something positive imparted to the polar waters giving\r\nthem motion, and of which the tropical waters are deprived. If, dipping\r\none hand into a basin filled with tropical water at 80° and the other\r\ninto one filled with polar water at 32°, we refer to our _sensations_,\r\nwe call the water in the one _hot_ and that in the other _cold_; but\r\nso far as the water itself is concerned heat and cold simply mean\r\ndifference in the amounts of heat possessed. Both the polar and the\r\ntropical water possess a certain amount of energy in the form of heat,\r\nonly the polar water does not possess so much of it as the tropical.\r\n\r\nHow, then, according to Dr. Carpenter, does polar cold impart motion\r\nto the water? The warm water flowing in upon the polar column becomes\r\nchilled by cold, but it is not cooled below that of the water\r\nunderneath; for, according to Dr. Carpenter, the ocean in polar regions\r\nis as cold and as dense underneath as at the surface. The cooled\r\nsurface-water does not sink through the water underneath, like the\r\nsurface-water of a pond chilled during a frosty night. “The descending\r\nmotion in column C will not consist,” he says, “in a successional\r\ndescent of surface-films from above downwards, but it will be a\r\ndownward movement of the _entire mass_, as if water in a tall jar\r\nwere being drawn off through an orifice at the bottom” (§ 29). There\r\nis a downward motion of the entire column, producing an outflow of\r\nwater at the bottom towards the equatorial column W, which outflow is\r\ncompensated by an inflow from the top of the equatorial column to the\r\ntop of the polar column C. But what causes column C to descend? The\r\ncause of the descent is its excess of weight over that of column W.\r\nColumn C descends and column W ascends, for the same reason that in\r\na balance the heavy scale descends and the light scale rises. Column\r\nC descends not simply because it is cold, but because it is _colder_\r\nthan column W. Column C descends not simply because in consequence of\r\nbeing cold it is dense and therefore heavy, but because in consequence\r\nof being cold it is _denser_ and therefore _heavier_ than column W.\r\nIt might be as cold as frozen mercury and as heavy as lead; but it\r\nwould not on that account descend unless it were heavier than column\r\nW. The descent of column C and ascent of column W, and consequently\r\nthe general oceanic circulation, results, therefore, according to Dr.\r\nCarpenter’s explanation, from the _difference_ in the weights of the\r\ntwo columns; and the difference in the weights of the two columns\r\nresults from their _difference_ of density; and the difference of\r\ndensity of the two columns in turn results from their _difference_ of\r\ntemperature. But it has already been proved that the difference of\r\ntemperature between the polar and equatorial columns depends wholly on\r\nthe difference in the amount of heat received by each from the sun. The\r\nequatorial column W possesses more heat than the polar column C, solely\r\nbecause it receives more heat from the sun than column C. Consequently\r\nDr. Carpenter’s statement that the circulation is produced by polar\r\ncold rather than by equatorial heat, is just as much in contradiction\r\nto his own theory as it is to the principles of mechanics. Again, his\r\nadmission that the general oceanic circulation “cannot be produced by\r\nthe application of heat to the surface,” is virtually a giving up the\r\nwhole point in debate; for according to his gravitation theory, and\r\nevery form of that theory, the circulation results from _difference_ of\r\ntemperature between equatorial and polar seas; but this difference, as\r\nwe have seen, is entirely owing to the difference in the amount of heat\r\nreceived from the sun at these two places. The heat received, however,\r\nis “surface-heat;” for it is at the surface that the ocean receives all\r\nits heat from the sun; and consequently if surface-heat cannot produce\r\nthe effect required, nothing else can.\r\n\r\n_M. Dubuat’s Experiments._—Referring to the experiments of M. Dubuat\r\nadduced by me to show that water would not run down a slope of 1\r\nin 1,820,000,[82] he says, “Now the experiments of M. Dubuat had\r\nreference, not to the slow restoration of level produced by the motion\r\nof water on itself, but to the sensible movement of water flowing over\r\nsolid surfaces and retarded by its friction against them” (§ 22).\r\nDr. Carpenter’s meaning, I presume, is that if the incline consist\r\nof any solid substance, water will not flow down it; but if it be\r\nmade of _water_ itself, _water_ will flow down it. But in M. Dubuat’s\r\nexperiments it was only the molecules in actual _contact_ with the\r\nsolid incline that could possibly be retarded by friction against it.\r\nThe molecules not in contact with the solid incline evidently rested\r\nupon an _incline of water_, and were at perfect liberty to roll down\r\nthat incline if they chose; but they did not do so; and consequently M.\r\nDubuat’s experiment proved that water will not flow over itself on an\r\nincline of 1 in 1,000,000.\r\n\r\n_A Begging of the Question at Issue._—“It is to be remembered,” says\r\nDr. Carpenter, “that, however small the original amount of movement\r\nmay be, a _momentum_ tending to its continuance _must_ be generated\r\nfrom the instant of its commencement; so that if the initiating force\r\nbe in constant action, there will be a _progressive acceleration_ of\r\nits rate, until the increase of resistance equalises the tendency to\r\nfurther acceleration. Now, if it be admitted that the propagation of\r\nthe disturbance of equilibrium from one column to another is simply\r\n_retarded_, _not_ prevented, by the viscosity of the liquid, I cannot\r\nsee how the conclusion can be resisted, that the constantly maintained\r\ndifference of gravity between the polar and equatorial columns really\r\nacts as a _vis viva_ in maintaining a circulation between them” (§ 35).\r\n\r\nIf it be true, as Dr. Carpenter asserts, that in the case of the\r\ngeneral oceanic circulation advocated by him “viscosity” simply\r\n_retards_ motion, but does not _prevent_ it, I certainly agree with him\r\n“that the constantly maintained difference of gravity between the polar\r\nand equatorial columns really acts as a _vis viva_ in maintaining a\r\ncirculation between them.” But to assert that it merely retards, but\r\ndoes not prevent, motion, is simply _begging the question at issue_.\r\nIt is an established principle that if the _force_ resisting motion be\r\ngreater than the force tending to produce it, then no motion can take\r\nplace and no work can be performed. The experiments of M. Dubuat prove\r\nthat the _force_ of the molecular resistance of water to motion is\r\n_greater_ than the _force_ derived from a slope of 1 in 1,000,000; and\r\ntherefore it is simply begging the question at issue to assert that it\r\nis _less_. The experiments of MM. Barlow, Rainey, and others, to which\r\nhe alludes, are scarcely worthy of consideration in relation to the\r\npresent question, because we know nothing whatever regarding the actual\r\namount of force producing motion of the water in these experiments,\r\nfurther than that it must have been enormously greater than that\r\nderived from a slope of 1 in 1,000,000.\r\n\r\n_Supposed Argument from the Tides._—Dr. Carpenter advances Mr.\r\nFerrel’s argument in regard to the tides. The power of the moon to\r\ndisturb the earth’s water, he asserts, is, according to Herschel,\r\nonly 1/11,400,000th part of gravity, and that of the sun not over\r\n1/25,736,400th part of gravity; yet the moon’s attractive force, even\r\nwhen counteracted by the sun, will produce a rise of the ocean. But as\r\nthe disturbance of gravity produced by difference of temperature is far\r\ngreater than the above, it ought to produce circulation.\r\n\r\nIt is here supposed that the force exerted by gravity on the ocean,\r\nresulting from difference of temperature, tending to produce the\r\ngeneral oceanic circulation, is much greater than the force exerted\r\non the ocean by the moon in the production of the tides. But if we\r\nexamine the subject we shall find that the opposite is the case. The\r\nattraction of the moon tending to lift the waters of the ocean acts\r\ndirectly on every molecule from the surface to the bottom; but the\r\nforce of gravity tending to produce the circulation in question acts\r\ndirectly on only a portion of the ocean. Gravity can exercise no direct\r\nforce in impelling the underflow from the polar to the equatorial\r\nregions, nor in raising the water to the surface when it reaches the\r\nequatorial regions. Gravity can exercise no direct influence in pulling\r\nthe water horizontally along the earth’s surface, nor in raising it\r\nup to the surface. The pull of gravity is always _downwards_, never\r\n_horizontally_ nor upwards. Gravity will tend to pull the surface-water\r\nfrom the equator to the poles because here we have _descent_. Gravity\r\nwill tend to sink the polar column because here also we have _descent_.\r\nBut these are the only parts of the circuit where gravity has any\r\ntendency to produce motion. Motion in the other parts of the circuit,\r\nviz., along the bottom of the ocean from the poles to the equator and\r\nin raising the equatorial column, is produced by the _pressure_ of the\r\npolar column; and consequently it is only _indirectly_ that gravity may\r\nbe said to produce motion in those parts. It is true that on certain\r\nportions of the ocean the force of gravity tending to produce motion is\r\ngreater than the force of the moon’s attraction, tending to produce the\r\ntides; but this portion of the ocean is of inconsiderable extent. The\r\ntotal force of gravity acting on the entire ocean tending to produce\r\ncirculation is in reality prodigiously less than the total force of the\r\nmoon tending to produce the tides.\r\n\r\nIt is no doubt a somewhat difficult problem to determine accurately\r\nthe total amount of force exercised by gravity on the ocean; but for\r\nour present purpose this is not necessary. All that we require at\r\npresent is a very rough estimate indeed. And this can be attained by\r\nvery simple considerations. Suppose we assume the mean depth of the\r\nsea to be, say, three miles. The mean depth may yet be found to be\r\nsomewhat less than this, or it may be found to be somewhat greater;\r\na slight mistake, however, in regard to the mass of the ocean will\r\nnot materially affect our conclusions. Taking the depth at 3 miles,\r\nthe force or direct pull of gravity on the entire waters of the ocean\r\ntending to the production of the general circulation will not amount to\r\nmore than 1/24,000,000,000th that of gravity, or only about 1/2,100th\r\nthat of the attraction of the moon in the production of the tides. Let\r\nit be observed that I am referring to the force or pull of gravity,\r\nand not to hydrostatic pressure.\r\n\r\nThe moon, by raising the waters of the ocean, will produce a slope of 2\r\nfeet in a quadrant; and because the raised water sinks and the level is\r\nrestored, Mr. Ferrel concludes that a similar slope of 2 feet produced\r\nby difference of temperature will therefore be sufficient to produce\r\nmotion and restore level. But it is overlooked that the restoration of\r\nlevel in the case of the tides is as truly the work of the moon as the\r\ndisturbance of that level is. For the water raised by the attraction of\r\nthe moon at one time is again, six hours afterwards, pulled down by the\r\nmoon when the earth has turned round a quadrant.\r\n\r\nNo doubt the earth’s gravity alone would in course of time restore\r\nthe level; but this does not follow as a logical consequence from Mr.\r\nFerrel’s premises. If we suppose a slope to be produced in the ocean by\r\nthe moon and the moon’s attraction withdrawn so as to allow the water\r\nto sink to its original level, the raised side will be the heaviest and\r\nthe depressed side the lightest; consequently the raised side will tend\r\nto sink and the depressed side will tend to rise, in order that the\r\nocean may regain its static equilibrium. But when a difference of level\r\nis produced by difference of temperature, the raised side is always the\r\nlightest and the depressed side is always the heaviest; consequently\r\nthe very effort which the ocean makes to maintain its equilibrium\r\ntends to prevent the level being restored. The moon produces the tides\r\nchiefly by means of a simple yielding of the entire ocean considered as\r\na mass; whereas in the case of a general oceanic circulation the level\r\nis restored by a _flow_ of water at or near the surface. Consequently\r\nthe amount of friction and molecular resistance to be overcome in the\r\nrestoration of level in the latter case is much greater than in the\r\nformer. The moon, as the researches of Sir William Thomson show, will\r\nproduce a tide in a globe composed of a substance where no currents or\r\ngeneral flow of the materials could possibly take place.\r\n\r\n_Pressure as a Cause of Circulation._—We shall now briefly refer to\r\nthe influence of pressure (the indirect effects of gravity) in the\r\nproduction of the circulation under consideration. That which causes\r\nthe polar column C to descend and the equatorial column W to ascend,\r\nas has repeatedly been remarked, is the difference in the weight of\r\nthe two columns. The efficient cause in the production of the movement\r\nis, properly speaking, gravity; _cold_ at the poles and _heat_ at the\r\nequator, or, what is the same thing, the _excess_ of heat received\r\nby the equator over that received by the poles is what maintains the\r\ndifference of temperature between the two columns, and consequently is\r\nthat also which maintains the difference of weight between them. In\r\nother words, difference of temperature is the cause which maintains\r\nthe _state of disturbed equilibrium_. But the efficient cause of\r\nthe circulation in question is gravity. Gravity, however, could not\r\nact without this state of disturbed equilibrium; and difference of\r\ntemperature may therefore be called, in relation to the circulation,\r\na necessary _condition_, while gravity may be termed the _cause_.\r\nGravity sinks column C _directly_, but it raises column W _indirectly_\r\nby means of pressure. The same holds true in regard to the motion of\r\nthe bottom-waters from C to W, which is likewise due to pressure. The\r\npressure of the excess of the weight of column C over that of column W\r\nimpels the bottom-water equatorwards and lifts the equatorial column.\r\nBut on this point I need not dwell, as I have in the preceding chapter\r\nentered into a full discussion as to how this takes place.\r\n\r\nWe come now to the most important part of the inquiry, viz., how is\r\nthe surface-water impelled from the equator to the poles? Is pressure\r\nfrom behind the impelling force here as in the case of the bottom-water\r\nof the ocean? It seems to me that, in attempting to account for the\r\nsurface-flow from the equator to the poles, Dr. Carpenter’s theory\r\nsignally fails. The force to which he appeals appears to be wholly\r\ninadequate to produce the required effect.\r\n\r\nThe experiments of M. Dubuat, as already noticed, prove that, any slope\r\nwhich can possibly result from the difference of temperature between\r\nthe equator and the poles is wholly insufficient to enable gravity to\r\nmove the waters; but it does not necessarily prove that the _pressure_\r\nresulting from the raised water at the equator may not be sufficient to\r\nproduce motion. This point will be better understood from the following\r\nfigure, where, as before, P C represents the polar column and E W the\r\nequatorial column.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 4.]\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that the water in that wedge-shaped portion W C\r\nW′ forming the incline cannot be in a state of static equilibrium.\r\nA molecule of water at O, for example, will be pressed more in the\r\ndirection of C than in the direction of W′, and the amount of this\r\nexcess of pressure towards C will depend upon the height of W above\r\nthe line C W′. It is evident that the pressure tending to move the\r\nmolecule at O towards C will be far greater than the direct pull of\r\ngravity tending to draw a molecule at O′ lying on the surface of the\r\nincline towards C. The experiments of M. Dubuat prove that the direct\r\nforce of gravity will not move the molecule at O′—that is, cause it to\r\nroll down the incline W C; but they do not prove that it may not yield\r\nto pressure from above, or that the pressure of the column W W′ will\r\nnot move the molecule at O. The pressure is caused by gravity, and\r\ncannot, of course, enable gravity to perform more work than what is\r\nderived from the energy of gravity; it will enable gravity, however,\r\nto overcome resistance, which it could not do by direct action. But\r\nwhether the pressure resulting from the greater height of the water\r\nat the equator due to its higher temperature be actually sufficient\r\nto produce displacement of the water is a question which I am wholly\r\nunable to answer.\r\n\r\nIf we suppose 4 feet 6 inches to be the height of the equatorial\r\nsurface above the polar required to make the two columns balance\r\neach other, the actual difference of level between the two columns\r\nwill certainly not be more than one-half that amount, because, if a\r\ncirculation exist, the weight of the polar column must always be in\r\nexcess of that of the equatorial. But this excess can only be obtained\r\nat the expense of the surface-slope, as has already been shown at\r\nlength. The surface-slope probably will not be more than 2 feet or 2\r\nfeet 6 inches. Suppose the ocean to be of equal density from the poles\r\nto the equator, and that by some means or other the surface of the\r\nocean at the equator is raised, say, 2 feet above that of the poles,\r\nthen there can be little doubt that in such a case the water would\r\nsoon regain its level; for the ocean at the equator being heavier than\r\nat the poles by the weight of a layer 2 feet in thickness, it would\r\nsink at the former place and rise at the latter until equilibrium was\r\nrestored, producing, of course, a very slight displacement of the\r\nbottom-waters towards the poles. It will be observed, however, that\r\nrestoration of level in this case takes place by a simple yielding, as\r\nit were, of the entire mass of the ocean without displacement of the\r\nmolecules of the water over each other to any great extent. In the case\r\nof a slope produced by difference of temperature, however, the raised\r\nportion of the ocean is not heavier but lighter than the depressed\r\nportion, and consequently has no tendency to sink. Any movement which\r\nthe ocean as a mass makes in order to regain equilibrium tends, as we\r\nhave seen, rather to increase the difference of level than to reduce\r\nit. Restoration of level can only be produced by the forces which are\r\nin operation in the wedge-shaped mass W C W′, constituting the slope\r\nitself. But it will be observed by a glance at the Figure that, in\r\norder to the restoration of level, a large portion of the water W W′ at\r\nthe equator will require to flow to C, the pole.\r\n\r\nAccording to the general _vertical_ oceanic circulation theory,\r\npressure from behind is not one of the forces employed in the\r\nproduction of the flow from the equator to the poles. This is evident;\r\nfor there can be no pressure from behind acting on the water if there\r\nbe no slope existing between the equator and the poles. Dr. Carpenter\r\nnot only denies the actual existence of a slope, but denies the\r\nnecessity for its existence. But to deny the existence of a slope is to\r\ndeny the existence of pressure, and to deny the necessity for a slope\r\nis to deny the necessity for pressure. That in Dr. Carpenter’s theory\r\nthe surface-water is supposed to be _drawn_ from the equator to the\r\npoles, and not _pressed_ forward by a force from behind, is further\r\nevident from the fact that he maintains that the force employed is not\r\n_vis a tergo_ but _vis a fronte_.[83]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n      THE INADEQUACY OF THE GRAVITATION THEORY PROVED BY ANOTHER\r\n                                METHOD.\r\n\r\n  Quantity of Heat which can be conveyed by the General Oceanic\r\n      Circulation trifling.—Tendency in the Advocates of the\r\n      Gravitation Theory to under-estimate the Volume of the\r\n      Gulf-stream.—Volume of the Stream as determined by the\r\n      _Challenger_.—Immense Volume of Warm Water discovered by\r\n      Captain Nares.—Condition of North Atlantic inconsistent with\r\n      the Gravitation Theory.—Dr. Carpenter’s Estimate of the\r\n      Thermal Work of the Gulf-stream.\r\n\r\n\r\nI shall now proceed by another method to prove the inadequacy of such\r\na general oceanic circulation as that which Dr. Carpenter advocates.\r\nBy contrasting the quantity of heat carried by the Gulf-stream from\r\ninter-tropical to temperate and polar regions with such amount as\r\ncan possibly be conveyed in the same direction by means of a general\r\noceanic circulation, it will become evident that the latter sinks into\r\nutter insignificance before the former.\r\n\r\nIn my earlier papers on the amount of heat conveyed by the\r\nGulf-stream,[84] I estimated the volume of that stream as _equal\r\nto that_ of a current 50 miles broad and 1,000 feet deep, flowing\r\n(from the surface to the bottom) at 4 miles an hour. Of course I did\r\nnot mean, as Dr. Carpenter seems to suppose, that the stream at any\r\nparticular place is 50 miles broad and 1,000 feet deep, or that it\r\nactually flows at the uniform rate of 4 miles an hour at surface and\r\nbottom. All I meant was, that the Gulf-stream is _equal to that_ of\r\na current of the above size and velocity. But in my recent papers on\r\nOcean-currents, the substance of which appears in the present volume,\r\nto obviate any objections on the grounds of having over-estimated the\r\nvolume, I have taken that at one half this estimate, viz., equal to\r\na current 50 miles broad and 1,000 feet deep flowing at the rate of\r\n2 miles an hour. I have estimated the mean temperature of the stream\r\nas it passes the Straits of Florida to be 65°, and have supposed that\r\nthe water in its course becomes ultimately cooled down on an average\r\nto 40°. In this case each pound of water conveys 19,300 foot-pounds of\r\nheat from the Gulf of Mexico, to be employed in warming temperate and\r\npolar regions. Assuming these data to be correct, it follows that the\r\namount of heat transferred from the Gulf of Mexico by this stream per\r\nday amounts to 77,479,650,000,000,000,000 foot-pounds. This enormous\r\nquantity of heat is equal to one-fourth of all that is received from\r\nthe sun by the whole of the Atlantic Ocean from the Tropic of Cancer up\r\nto the Arctic Circle.\r\n\r\nThis is the amount of heat conveyed from inter-tropical to temperate\r\nand polar regions by the Gulf-stream. What now is the amount conveyed\r\nby means of the General Oceanic Circulation?\r\n\r\nAccording to this theory there ought to be as much warm water flowing\r\nfrom inter-tropical regions towards the Antarctic as towards the Arctic\r\nCircle. We may, therefore, in our calculations, consider that the heat\r\nwhich is received in tropical regions to the south of the equator goes\r\nto warm the southern hemisphere, and that received on the north side\r\nof the equator to warm the northern hemisphere. The warm currents\r\nfound in the North Atlantic in temperate regions we may conclude came\r\nfrom the regions lying to the north of the equator,—or, in other\r\nwords, from that part of the Atlantic lying between the equator and\r\nthe Tropic of Cancer. At least, according to the gravitation theory,\r\nwe have no reason to believe that the quantity of warm water flowing\r\nfrom tropical to temperate and polar regions in the Atlantic is\r\ngreater than the area between the equator and the Tropic of Cancer\r\ncan supply—because it is affirmed that a very large proportion of the\r\ncold water found in the North Atlantic comes, not from the arctic, but\r\nfrom the antarctic regions. But if the North Atlantic is cooled by a\r\ncold stream from the southern hemisphere, the southern hemisphere in\r\nturn must be heated by a warm current from the North Atlantic—unless\r\nwe assume that the compensating current flowing from the Atlantic into\r\nthe southern hemisphere is as cold as the antarctic current, which is\r\nvery improbable. But Dr. Carpenter admits that the quantity of warm\r\nwater flowing from the Atlantic in equatorial regions towards the\r\nsouth is even greater than that flowing northwards. “The unrestricted\r\ncommunication,” he says, “which exists between the antarctic area and\r\nthe great Southern Ocean-basins would involve, if the doctrine of a\r\ngeneral oceanic circulation be admitted, a much more considerable\r\ninterchange of waters between the antarctic and the equatorial areas\r\nthan is possible in the northern hemisphere.”[85]\r\n\r\nWe have already seen that, were it not for the great mass of warm water\r\nwhich finds its way to the polar regions, the temperature of these\r\nregions would be enormously lower than they really are. It has been\r\nshown likewise that the comparatively high temperature of north-western\r\nEurope is due to the same cause. But if it be doubtful whether the\r\nGulf-stream reaches our shores, and if it be true that, even supposing\r\nit did, it “could only affect the _most superficial_ stratum,” and that\r\nthe great mass of warm water found by Dr. Carpenter in his dredging\r\nexpeditions came directly from the equatorial regions, and not from\r\nthe Gulf-stream, then the principal part of the heating-effect must be\r\nattributed, not to the Gulf-stream, but to the general flow of water\r\nfrom the equatorial regions. It surely would not, then, be too much to\r\nassume that the quantity of heat conveyed from equatorial regions by\r\nthis general flow of water into the North Atlantic is at least equal to\r\nthat conveyed by the Gulf-stream. If we assume this to be the amount of\r\nheat conveyed by the two agencies into the Atlantic from inter-tropical\r\nregions, it will, of course, be equal to twice that conveyed by the\r\nGulf-stream alone.\r\n\r\nWe shall now consider whether the area of the Atlantic to the north of\r\nthe equator is sufficient to supply the amount of heat demanded by Dr.\r\nCarpenter’s theory.\r\n\r\nThe entire area of the Atlantic, extending from the equator to the\r\nTropic of Cancer, including the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico,\r\nis about 7,700,000 square miles.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of heat conveyed by the Gulf-stream through the Straits of\r\nFlorida is, as we have already endeavoured to show, equal to all the\r\nheat received from the sun by 1,560,935 square miles at the equator.\r\nThe annual quantity of heat received from the sun by the torrid zone\r\nper unit surface, taking the mean of the whole zone, is to that\r\nreceived by the equator as 39 to 40, consequently the quantity of\r\nheat conveyed by the Gulf-stream is equal to all the heat received by\r\n1,600,960 square miles of the Atlantic in the torrid zone.\r\n\r\nBut if, according to Dr. Carpenter’s views, the quantity of heat\r\nconveyed from the tropical regions is double that conveyed by the\r\nGulf-stream, the amount of heat in this case conveyed into the Atlantic\r\nin temperate regions will be equal to all the heat received from the\r\nsun by 3,201,920 square miles of the Atlantic between the equator and\r\nthe Tropic of Cancer. This is 32/77ths of all the heat received from\r\nthe sun by that area.\r\n\r\nTaking the annual quantity received per unit surface at the equator at\r\n1,000, the quantities received by the three zones would be respectively\r\nas follows:—\r\n\r\n  Equator            1000\r\n  Torrid zone         975\r\n  Temperate zone      757\r\n  Frigid zone         454\r\n\r\nNow, if we remove from the Atlantic in tropical regions 32/77ths of the\r\nheat received from the sun, we remove 405 parts from every 975 received\r\nfrom the sun, and consequently only 570 parts per unit surface remain.\r\n\r\nIt has been shown[86] that the quantity of heat conveyed by the\r\nGulf-stream from the equatorial regions into the temperate regions\r\nis equal to 100/412ths of all the heat received by the Atlantic in\r\ntemperate regions. But according to the theory under consideration the\r\nquantity removed is double this, or equal to 100/206ths of all the heat\r\nreceived from the sun. But the amount received from the sun is equal\r\nto 757 parts per unit surface; add then to this 100/206ths of 757, or\r\n367, and we have 1,124 parts of heat per unit surface as the amount\r\npossessed by the Atlantic in temperate regions. The Atlantic should in\r\nthis case be much warmer in temperate than in tropical regions; for\r\nin temperate regions it would possess 1,124 parts of heat per unit\r\nsurface, whereas in tropical regions it would possess only 570 parts\r\nper unit surface. Of course the heat conveyed from tropical regions\r\ndoes not all remain in temperate regions; a very considerable portion\r\nof it must pass into the arctic regions. Let us, then, assume that\r\none half goes to warm the Arctic Ocean, and the other half remains\r\nin the temperate regions. In this case 183·5 parts would remain, and\r\nconsequently 757 + 183·5 = 940·5 parts would be the quantity possessed\r\nby the Atlantic in temperate regions, a quantity which still exceeds by\r\nno less than 370·5 parts the heat possessed by the Atlantic in tropical\r\nregions.\r\n\r\nAs one half of the amount of heat conveyed from the tropical regions\r\nis assumed to go into the Arctic Ocean, the quantity passing into\r\nthat ocean would therefore be equal to that which passes through the\r\nStraits of Florida, an amount which, as we have found, is equal to all\r\nthe heat received from the sun by 3,436,900 square miles of the Arctic\r\nOcean.[87] The entire area covered by sea beyond the Arctic Circle is\r\nunder 5,000,000 square miles; but taking the Arctic Ocean in round\r\nnumbers at 5,000,000 square miles, the quantity of heat conveyed into\r\nit by currents to that received from the sun would therefore be as\r\n3,436,900 to 5,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe amount received on the unit surface of the arctic regions we have\r\nseen to be 454 parts. The amount received from the currents would\r\ntherefore be 312 parts. This gives 766 parts of heat per unit surface\r\nas the quantity possessed by the Arctic Ocean. Thus the Arctic Ocean\r\nalso would contain more heat than the Atlantic in tropical regions; for\r\nthe Atlantic in these regions would, in the case under consideration,\r\npossess only 570 parts, while the Arctic Ocean would possess 766\r\nparts. It is true that more rays are cut off in arctic regions than in\r\ntropical; but still, after making due allowance for this, the Arctic\r\nOcean, if the theory we are considering were true, ought to be as warm\r\nas, if not warmer than, the Atlantic in tropical regions. The relative\r\nquantities of heat possessed by the three zones would therefore be as\r\nfollows:—\r\n\r\n  Atlantic, in torrid zone        570\r\n     〃      in temperate zone     940\r\n     〃      in frigid zone        766\r\n\r\nIt is here assumed, however, that none of the heat possessed by the\r\nGulf-stream is derived from the southern hemisphere, which, we know,\r\nis not the case. But supposing that as much as one half of the heat\r\npossessed by the stream came from the southern hemisphere, and that the\r\nother half was obtained from the seas lying between the equator and the\r\nTropic of Cancer, the relative proportions of heat possessed by the\r\nthree zones per given area would be as follows:—\r\n\r\n  Atlantic, in torrid zone        671\r\n     〃      in temperate zone     940\r\n     〃      in frigid zone        766\r\n\r\nThis proves incontestably that, supposing there is such a general\r\noceanic circulation as is maintained, the quantity of heat conveyed by\r\nmeans of it into the North Atlantic and Arctic Oceans must be trifling\r\nin comparison with that conveyed by the Gulf-stream; for if it nearly\r\nequalled that conveyed by the Gulf-stream, then not only the North\r\nAtlantic in temperate regions, but even the Arctic Ocean itself would\r\nbe much warmer than the inter-tropical seas. In fact, so far as the\r\ndistribution of heat over the globe is concerned, it is a matter of\r\nindifference whether there really is or is not such a thing as this\r\ngeneral oceanic circulation. The enormous amount of heat conveyed by\r\nthe Gulf-stream alone puts it beyond all doubt that ocean-currents are\r\nthe great agents employed in distributing over the globe the excess of\r\nheat received by the sea in inter-tropical regions.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore, so far as concerns the theory of a General Oceanic\r\nCirculation, of the utmost importance that the advocates of that\r\ntheory should prove that I have over-estimated the thermal power of\r\nthe Gulf-stream. This, however, can only be done by detecting some\r\nerror either in my computation or in the data on which it is based;\r\nyet neither Dr. Carpenter nor any one else, as far as I know, has\r\nchallenged the accuracy of my figures. The question at issue is the\r\ncorrectness of the data; but the only part of the data which can\r\npossibly admit of being questioned is my estimate of the _volume_\r\nand _temperature_ of the stream. Dr. Carpenter, however, does not\r\nmaintain that I have over-estimated the temperature of the stream; on\r\nthe contrary, he affirms that I have really under-estimated it. “If we\r\nassume,” he remarks, “the limit of the stratum above 60° as that of\r\nthe real Gulf-stream current, we shall find its average temperature to\r\nbe somewhat higher than it has been stated by Mr. Croll, who seems to\r\nhave taken 65° as the average of the water flowing through the entire\r\nchannel. The average surface temperature of the Florida channel for\r\nthe whole year is 80°; and we may fairly set the average of the entire\r\noutgoing stream, down to the plane of 60°, at 70°, instead of 65° as\r\nestimated by Mr. Croll” (§ 141). It follows, then, that every pound of\r\nwater of the Gulf-stream actually conveys 5 units of heat more than\r\nI have estimated it to do—the amount conveyed being 30 units instead\r\nof 25 units as estimated by me. Consequently, if the Gulf-stream be\r\nequal to that of a current of merely 41½ miles broad and 1,000 feet\r\ndeep, flowing at the rate of 2 miles an hour, it will still convey the\r\nestimated quantity of heat. But this estimate of the volume of the\r\nstream, let it be observed, barely exceeds _one-third_ of that given\r\nby Herschel, Maury, and Colding,[88] and is little more than one-half\r\nthat assigned to it by Mr. Laughton, while it very little exceeds that\r\ngiven by Mr. Findlay,[89] an author whom few will consider likely to\r\noverrate either the volume or heating-power of the stream.\r\n\r\nThe important results obtained during the _Challenger_ expedition have\r\nclearly proved that I have neither over-estimated the temperature nor\r\nthe volume of the Gulf-stream. Between Bermuda and Sandy Hook the\r\nstream is 60 miles broad and 600 feet deep, with a maximum velocity of\r\nfrom 3½ to 4 miles an hour. If the mean velocity of the entire section\r\namounts to 2¼ miles an hour, which it probably does, the volume of the\r\nstream must equal that given in my estimate. But we have no evidence\r\nthat all the water flowing through the Straits of Florida passes\r\nthrough the section examined by the officers of the _Challenger_. Be\r\nthis, however, as it may, the observations made between St. Thomas\r\nand Sandy Hook reveal the existence of an immense flow of warm water,\r\n2,300 feet deep, entirely distinct from the water included in the above\r\nsection of the Gulf-stream proper. As the thickest portion of this\r\nimmense body of water joins the warm water of the Gulf-stream, Captain\r\nNares considers that “it is evidently connected with it, and probably\r\nas an offshoot.” At Sandy Hook, according to him, it extends 1,200\r\nfeet deeper than the Gulf-stream itself, but off Charleston, 600 miles\r\nnearer the source, the same temperature is found at the same depth.\r\nBut whether it be an offshoot of the Gulf-stream or not, one thing is\r\ncertain, it can only come from the Gulf of Mexico or from the Caribbean\r\nSea. This mass of water, after flowing northwards for about 1,000\r\nmiles, turns to the right and crosses the Atlantic in the direction of\r\nthe Azores, where it appears to thin out.\r\n\r\nIf, therefore, we take into account the combined heat conveyed by\r\nboth streams, my estimate of the heat transferred from inter-tropical\r\nregions into the North Atlantic will be found rather under than above\r\nthe truth.\r\n\r\n_Dr. Carpenter’s Estimate of the Thermal Work of the Gulf-stream._—In\r\nthe appendix to an elaborate memoir on Oceanic Circulation lately\r\nread before the Geographical Society, Dr. Carpenter endeavours to\r\nshow that I have over-estimated the thermal work of the Gulf-stream.\r\nIn that memoir[90] he has also favoured us with his own estimate of\r\nthe sectional area, rate of flow, and temperature of the stream. Even\r\nadopting his data, however, I find myself unable to arrive at his\r\nconclusions.\r\n\r\nLet us consider first his estimate of the sectional area of the\r\nstream. He admits that “it is impossible, in the present state of our\r\nknowledge, to arrive at any exact estimate of the sectional area of the\r\nstream; since it is for the most part only from the temperatures of\r\nits different strata that we can judge whether they are, or are not,\r\nin movement, and what is the direction of their movement.” Now it is\r\nperfectly evident that our estimate of the sectional area of the stream\r\nwill depend upon what we assume to be its bottom temperature. If, for\r\nexample, we assume 70° to be the bottom temperature, we shall have a\r\nsmall sectional area. Taking the temperature at 60°, the sectional\r\narea will be larger, and if 50° be assumed to be the temperature, the\r\nsectional area will be larger still, and so on. Now the small sectional\r\narea obtained by Dr. Carpenter arises from the fact of his having\r\nassumed the high temperature of 60° to be that of the bottom of the\r\nstream. He concludes that all the water below 60° has an inward flow,\r\nand that it is only that portion from 60° and upwards which constitutes\r\nthe Gulf-stream. I have been unable to find any satisfactory evidence\r\nfor assuming so high a temperature for the bottom of the stream. It\r\nmust be observed that the water underlying the Gulf-stream is not\r\nthe ordinary water of the Atlantic, but the cold current from the\r\narctic regions. In fact, it is the same water which reaches the\r\nequator at almost every point with a temperature not much above the\r\nfreezing-point. It is therefore highly improbable that the under\r\nsurface of the Gulf-stream has a temperature so high as 60°.\r\n\r\nDr. Carpenter’s method of measuring the mean velocity of the\r\nGulf-stream is equally objectionable. He takes the mean annual rate at\r\nthe surface in the “Narrows” to be two miles an hour and the rate at\r\nthe bottom to be zero, and he concludes from this that the average rate\r\nof the whole is one mile an hour—the arithmetical mean between these\r\ntwo extremes. Now it will be observed that this conclusion only holds\r\ntrue on the supposition that the breadth of the stream is as great at\r\nthe bottom as at the surface, which of course it is not. All admit that\r\nthe sides of the Gulf-stream are not perpendicular, but slope somewhat\r\nin the manner of the banks of a river. The stream is broad at the\r\nsurface and narrows towards the bottom. It is therefore evident that\r\nthe upper half of the section has a much larger area than the lower;\r\nthe quantity of water flowing through the upper half with a greater\r\nvelocity than one mile an hour must be much larger than the quantity\r\nflowing through the lower half with a less velocity than one mile an\r\nhour.\r\n\r\nHis method of estimating the mean temperature of the stream is even\r\nmore objectionable. He says, “The average surface temperature of the\r\nFlorida Channel for the whole year is 80°, and we may set the average\r\nof the entire outgoing stream down to the plane of 60° at 70°, instead\r\nof 65°, as estimated by Mr. Croll.” If 80° be the surface and 60° be\r\nthe bottom temperature, temperature and rate of velocity being assumed\r\nof course to decrease uniformly from the surface downwards, how is it\r\npossible that 70° can be the average temperature? The amount of water\r\nflowing through the upper half of the section, with a temperature above\r\n70°, is far more than the amount flowing through the under half of the\r\nsection, with a temperature below 70°. Supposing the lower half of the\r\nsection to be as large as the upper half, which it is not, still the\r\nquantity of water flowing through it would only equal one-third of\r\nthat flowing through the upper half, because the mean velocity of the\r\nwater in the lower half would be only half a mile per hour, whereas\r\nthe mean velocity of that in the upper half would be a mile and a half\r\nan hour. But the area of the lower half is much less than that of the\r\nupper half, consequently the amount of water whose temperature is under\r\n70° must be even much under one-third of that, the temperature of which\r\nis above 70°.\r\n\r\nHad Dr. Carpenter taken the proper method of estimating the mean\r\ntemperature, he would have found that 75°, even according to his own\r\ndata, was much nearer the truth than 70°. I pointed out, several years\r\nago,[91] the fallacy of estimating the mean temperature of a stream in\r\nthis way.\r\n\r\nSo high a mean temperature as 75° for the Gulf-stream, even in the\r\nFlorida Channel, is manifestly absurd, but if 60° be the bottom\r\ntemperature of the stream, the mean temperature cannot possibly be much\r\nunder that amount. It is, of course, by under-estimating the sectional\r\narea of the stream that its mean temperature is over-estimated. We\r\ncannot reduce the mean temperature without increasing the sectional\r\narea. If my estimate of 65° be taken as the mean temperature, which I\r\nhave little doubt will yet be found to be not far from the truth, Dr.\r\nCarpenter’s estimate of the sectional area must be abandoned. For if\r\n65° be the mean temperature of the stream, its bottom temperature must\r\nbe far under 60°, and if the bottom temperature be much under 60°, then\r\nthe sectional area must be greater than he estimates it to be.\r\n\r\nBe this, however, as it may; even if we suppose that 60° will\r\neventually be found to be the actual bottom temperature of the\r\nGulf-stream, nevertheless, if the total quantity of heat conveyed by\r\nthe stream from inter-tropical regions be estimated in the proper way,\r\nwe shall still find that amount to be so enormous, that there is not\r\nsufficient heat remaining in those regions to supply Dr. Carpenter’s\r\noceanic circulation with a quantity as great for distribution in the\r\nNorth Atlantic.\r\n\r\nIt therefore follows (and so far as regards the theory of Secular\r\nchanges of climate, this is all that is worth contending for) that\r\nOcean-currents and not a General Oceanic Circulation resulting from\r\ngravity, are the great agents employed in the distribution of heat over\r\nthe globe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n              MR. A. G. FINDLAY’S OBJECTIONS CONSIDERED.\r\n\r\n  Mr. Findlay’s Estimate of the Volume of the Gulf-stream.—Mean\r\n      Temperature of a Cross Section less than Mean Temperature\r\n      of Stream.—Reason of such Diversity of Opinion regarding\r\n      Ocean-currents.—More rigid Method of Investigation necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of the reading of Dr. Carpenter’s paper before the\r\nRoyal Geographical Society, on January 9th, 1871, Mr. Findlay made the\r\nfollowing remarks:—\r\n\r\n“When, by the direction of the United States Government, ten or eleven\r\nyears ago, the narrowest part of the Gulf-stream was examined, figures\r\nwere obtained which shut out all idea of its ever reaching our shores\r\nas a heat-bearing current. In the narrowest part, certainly not more\r\nthan from 250 to 300 cubic miles of water pass per diem. Six months\r\nafterwards that water reaches the banks of Newfoundland, and nine or\r\ntwelve months afterwards the coast of England, by which time it is\r\npopularly supposed to cover an area of 1,500,000 square miles. The\r\nproportion of the water that passes through the Gulf of Florida will\r\nnot make a layer of water more than 6 inches thick per diem over such\r\na space. Every one knows how soon a cup of tea cools; and yet it is\r\ncommonly imagined that a film of only a few inches in depth, after the\r\nlapse of so long a time, has an effect upon our climate. There is no\r\nneed for calculations; the thing is self-evident.”[92]\r\n\r\nAbout five years ago, Mr. Findlay objected to the conclusions which I\r\nhad arrived at regarding the enormous heating-power of the Gulf-stream\r\non the ground that I had over-estimated the volume of the stream. He\r\nstated that its volume was only about the half of what I had estimated\r\nit to be. To obviate this objection, I subsequently reduced the volume\r\nto one-half of my former estimate.[93] But taking the volume at this\r\nlow estimate, it was nevertheless found that the quantity of heat\r\nconveyed into the Atlantic through the Straits of Florida by means of\r\nthe stream was equal to about _one-fourth_ of all the heat received\r\nfrom the sun by the Atlantic from the latitude of the Strait of Florida\r\nup to the Arctic Circle.\r\n\r\nMr. Findlay, in his paper read before the British Association, affirmed\r\nthat the volume of the stream is somewhere from 294 to 333 cubic miles\r\nper day; but in his remarks at the close of Dr. Carpenter’s address, he\r\nstated it to be not greater than from 250 to 300 cubic miles per day. I\r\nam unable to reconcile any of those figures with the data from which he\r\nappears to have derived them. In his paper to the British Association,\r\nhe remarks that “the Gulf-stream at its outset is not more than 39½\r\nmiles wide, and 1,200 feet deep.” From all attainable data, he computes\r\nthe mean annual rate of motion to be 65·4 miles per day; but as the\r\nrate decreases with the depth, the mean velocity of the whole mass does\r\nnot exceed 49·4 miles per day. When he speaks of the mean velocity of\r\nthe Gulf-stream being so and so, he must refer to the mean velocity at\r\nsome particular place. This is evident; for the mean velocity entirely\r\ndepends upon the sectional area of the stream. The place where the\r\nmean velocity is 49·4 miles per day must be the place where it is 39½\r\nmiles broad and 1,200 feet deep; for he is here endeavouring to show us\r\nhow small the volume of the stream actually is. Now, unless the mean\r\nvelocity refers to the place where he gives us the breadth and depth\r\nof the stream, his figures have no bearing on the point in question.\r\nBut a stream 39½ miles broad and 1,200 feet deep has a sectional area\r\nof 8·97 square miles, and this, with a mean velocity of 49·4 miles\r\nper day, will give 443 cubic miles of water. The amount, according to\r\nmy estimate, is 459 cubic miles per day; it therefore exceeds Mr.\r\nFindlay’s estimate by only 16 cubic miles.\r\n\r\nMr. Findlay does not, as far as I know, consider that I have\r\nover-estimated the mean temperature of the stream. He states[94] that\r\nbetween Sand Key and Havana the Gulf-stream is about 1,200 feet deep,\r\nand that it does not reach the summit of a submarine ridge, which he\r\nstates has a temperature of 60°. It is evident, then, that the bottom\r\nof the stream has a temperature of at least 60°, which is within 5° of\r\nwhat I regard as the mean temperature of the mass. But the surface of\r\nthe stream is at least 17° above this mean. Now, when we consider that\r\nit is at the upper parts of the stream, the place where the temperature\r\nis so much above 65°, that the motion is greatest, it is evident that\r\nthe mean temperature of the entire moving mass must, according to Mr.\r\nFindlay, be considerably over 65°. It therefore follows, according\r\nto his own data, that the Gulf-stream conveys into the Atlantic an\r\namount of heat equal to one-fourth of all the heat which the Atlantic,\r\nfrom the latitude of the Straits of Florida up to the arctic regions,\r\nderives from the sun.\r\n\r\nBut it must be borne in mind that although the mean temperature of the\r\ncross section should be below 65°, it does not therefore follow that\r\nthe mean temperature of the _water flowing through this cross section_\r\nmust be below that temperature, for it is perfectly obvious that the\r\nmean temperature of the mass of water flowing through the cross section\r\nin a given time must be much higher than that of the cross section\r\nitself. The reason is very simple. It is in the upper half of the\r\nsection where the high temperature exists; but as the velocity of the\r\nstream is much greater in its upper than in its lower half, the greater\r\nportion of the water passing through this cross section is water of\r\nhigh temperature.\r\n\r\nBut even supposing we were to halve Mr. Findlay’s own estimate, and\r\nassume that the volume of the stream is equal to only 222 cubic miles\r\nof water per day instead of 443, still the amount of heat conveyed\r\nwould be equal to one-eighth part of the heat received from the sun by\r\nthe Atlantic. But would not the withdrawal of an amount of heat equal\r\nto one-eighth of that received from the sun greatly affect the climate\r\nof the Atlantic? Supposing we take the mean temperature of the Atlantic\r\nat, say, 56°; this will make its temperature 295° above that of space.\r\nExtinguish the sun and stop the Gulf-stream, and the temperature ought\r\nto sink 295°. How far, then, ought the temperature to sink, supposing\r\nthe sun to remain and the Gulf-stream to stop? Would not the withdrawal\r\nof the stream cause the temperature to sink some 30°? Of course, if\r\nthe Gulf-stream were withdrawn and everything else were to remain the\r\nsame, the temperature of the Atlantic would not actually remain 30°\r\nlower than at present; for heat would flow in from all sides and partly\r\nmake up for the loss of the stream. But nevertheless 30° represents the\r\namount of temperature maintained by means of the heat from the stream.\r\nAnd this, be it observed, is taking the volume of the stream at a lower\r\nestimate than even Mr. Findlay himself would be willing to admit. Mr.\r\nFindlay says that, by the time the Gulf-stream reaches the shores of\r\nEngland, it is supposed to cover a space of 1,500,000 square miles.\r\n“The proportion of water that passes through the Straits of Florida\r\nwill not make,” according to him, “a layer of water more than 6 inches\r\nthick per diem over such a space.” But a layer of water 6 inches thick\r\ncooling 25° will give out 579,000 foot-pounds of heat per square foot.\r\nIf, therefore, the Gulf-stream, as he asserts, supplies 6 inches per\r\nday to that area, then every square foot of the area gives off per\r\nday 579,000 foot-pounds of heat. The amount of heat received from the\r\nsun per square foot in latitude 55°, which is not much above the mean\r\nlatitude of Great Britain, is 1,047,730 foot-pounds per day, taking, of\r\ncourse, the mean of the whole year; _consequently this layer of water\r\ngives out an amount of heat equal to more than_ one-half _of all that\r\nis received from the sun_. But assuming that the stream should leave\r\nthe half of its heat on the American shores and carry to the shores of\r\nBritain only 12½° of heat, still we should have 289,500 foot-pounds per\r\nsquare foot, which notwithstanding _is more than equal to_ one-fourth\r\n_of that received from the sun_. If an amount of heat so enormous\r\ncannot affect climate, what can?\r\n\r\nI shall just allude to one other erroneous notion which prevails in\r\nregard to the Gulf-stream; but it is an error which I by no means\r\nattribute either to Mr. Findlay or to Dr. Carpenter. The error to which\r\nI refer is that of supposing that when the Gulf-stream widens out to\r\nhundreds of miles, as it does before it reaches our shores, its depth\r\nmust on this account be much less than when it issues from the Gulf of\r\nMexico. Although the stream may be hundreds of miles in breadth, there\r\nis no necessity why it should be only 6 inches, or 6 feet, or 60 feet,\r\nor even 600 feet in depth. It may just as likely be 6,000 feet deep as\r\n6 inches.\r\n\r\n_The Reason why such Diversity of Opinion prevails in Regard to\r\nOcean-currents._—In conclusion I venture to remark that more than\r\nnine-tenths of all the error and uncertainty which prevail, both\r\nin regard to the cause of ocean-currents and to their influence on\r\nclimate, is due, not, as is generally supposed, to the intrinsic\r\ndifficulties of the subject, but rather to the defective methods\r\nwhich have hitherto been employed in its investigation—that is, in\r\nnot treating the subject according to the rigid methods adopted in\r\nother departments of physics. What I most particularly allude to is\r\nthe disregard paid to the modern method of determining the amount of\r\neffects in _absolute measure_.\r\n\r\nBut let me not be misunderstood on this point. I by no means suppose\r\nthat the _absolute quantity_ is the thing always required for its\r\nown sake. It is in most cases required simply as a means to an end;\r\nand very often that end is the knowledge of the _relative_ quantity.\r\nTake, for example, the Gulf-stream. Suppose the question is asked,\r\nto what extent does the heat conveyed by that stream influence the\r\nclimate of the North Atlantic? In order to the proper answering of this\r\nquestion, the principal thing required is to know what proportion the\r\namount of heat conveyed by the stream into the Atlantic bears to that\r\nreceived from the sun by that area. We want the _relative proportions_\r\nof these two quantities. But how are we to obtain them? We can only\r\ndo so by determining first the _absolute_ quantity of each. We must\r\nfirst measure each before we can know how much the one is greater\r\nthan the other, or, in other words, before we can know their relative\r\nproportions. We have the means of determining the absolute amount\r\nof heat received from the sun by a given area at any latitude with\r\ntolerable accuracy; but the same cannot be done with equal accuracy in\r\nregard to the amount of heat conveyed by the Gulf-stream, because the\r\nvolume and mean temperature of the stream are not known with certainty.\r\nNevertheless we have sufficient data to enable us to fix upon such a\r\nmaximum and minimum value to these quantities as will induce us to\r\nadmit that the truth must lie somewhere between them. In order to give\r\nfull justice to those who maintain that the Gulf-stream exercises\r\nbut little influence on climate, and to put an end to all further\r\nobjections as to the uncertainty of my data, I shall take a minimum\r\nto which none of them surely can reasonably object, viz. that the\r\nvolume of the stream is not over 230 cubic miles per day, and the heat\r\nconveyed per pound of water not over 12½ units. Calculating from these\r\ndata, we find that the amount of heat carried into the North Atlantic\r\nis equal to one-sixteenth of all the heat received from the sun by that\r\narea. There are, I presume, few who will not admit that the actual\r\nproportion is much higher than this, probably as high as 1 to 3, or 1\r\nto 4. But, who, without adopting the method I have pursued, could ever\r\nhave come to the conclusion that the proportion was even 1 to 16? He\r\nmight have guessed it to be 1 to 100 or 1 to 1000, but he never would\r\nhave guessed it to be 1 to 16. Hence the reason why the great influence\r\nof the Gulf-stream as a heating agent has been so much under-estimated.\r\n\r\nThe same remarks apply to the gravitation theory of the cause of\r\ncurrents. Viewed simply as a theory it looks very reasonable. There is\r\nno one acquainted with physics but will admit that the tendency of the\r\ndifference of temperature between the equator and the poles is to cause\r\na surface current from the equator towards the poles, and an under\r\ncurrent from the poles to the equator. But before we can prove that\r\nthis tendency does actually produce such currents, another question\r\nmust be settled, viz. is this force sufficiently great to produce\r\nthe required motion? Now when we apply the method to which I refer,\r\nand determine the absolute amount of the force resulting from the\r\ndifference of specific gravity, we discover that not to be the powerful\r\nagent which the advocates of the gravitation theory suppose, but a\r\nforce so infinitesimal as not to be worthy of being taken into account\r\nwhen considering the causes by which currents are produced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n                THE WIND THEORY OF OCEANIC CIRCULATION.\r\n\r\n  Ocean-currents not due alone to the Trade-winds.—An Objection\r\n      by Maury.—Trade-winds do not explain the Great Antarctic\r\n      Current.—Ocean-currents due to the System of Winds.—The\r\n      System of Currents agrees with the System of the\r\n      Winds.—Chart showing the Agreement between the System\r\n      of Currents and System of Winds.—Cause of the Gibraltar\r\n      Current.—North Atlantic an immense Whirlpool.—Theory of Under\r\n      Currents.—Difficulty regarding Under Currents obviated.—Work\r\n      performed by the Wind in impelling the Water forward.—The\r\n      _Challenger’s_ crucial Test of the Wind and Gravitation\r\n      Theories.—North Atlantic above the Level of Equator.—Thermal\r\n      Condition of the Southern Ocean irreconcilable with the\r\n      Gravitation Theory.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ocean-currents not due alone to the Trade-winds._—The generally\r\nreceived opinion amongst the advocates of the wind theory of oceanic\r\ncirculation is that the Gulf-stream and other currents of the ocean are\r\ndue to the impulse of the trade-winds. The tendency of the trade-winds\r\nis to impel the inter-tropical waters along the line of the equator\r\nfrom east to west; and were those regions not occupied in some places\r\nby land, this equatorial current would flow directly round the\r\nglobe. Its westward progress, however, is arrested by the two great\r\ncontinents, the old and the new. On approaching the land the current\r\nbifurcates, one portion trending northwards and the other southwards.\r\nThe northern branch of the equatorial current of the Atlantic passes\r\ninto the Caribbean Sea, and after making a circuit of the Gulf of\r\nMexico, flows northward and continues its course into the Arctic\r\nOcean. The southern branch, on the other hand, is deflected along the\r\nSouth-American coast, constituting what is known as the Brazilian\r\ncurrent. In the Pacific a similar deflection occurs against the\r\nAsiatic coast, forming a current somewhat resembling the Gulf-stream,\r\na portion of which (Kamtschatka current) in like manner passes into\r\nthe arctic regions. In reference to all these various currents, the\r\nimpelling cause is supposed to be the force of the trade-winds.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, urged as an objection by Maury and other advocates of\r\nthe gravitation theory, that a current like the Gulf-stream, extending\r\nas far as the arctic regions, could not possibly be impelled and\r\nmaintained by a force acting at the equatorial regions. But this is\r\na somewhat weak objection. It seems to be based upon a misconception\r\nof the magnitude of the force in operation. It does not take into\r\naccount that this force acts on nearly the whole area of the ocean in\r\ninter-tropical regions. If, in a basin of water, say three feet in\r\ndiameter, a force is applied sufficient to produce a surface-flow one\r\nfoot broad across the centre of the basin, the water impelled against\r\nthe side will be deflected to the extremes of the vessel. And this\r\nresult does not in any way depend upon the size of the basin. The\r\nsame effect which occurs in a small basin will occur in a large one,\r\nprovided the proportion between the breadth of the belt of water put in\r\nmotion and the size of the vessel be the same in both cases. It does\r\nnot matter, therefore, whether the diameter of the basin be supposed to\r\nbe three feet, or three thousand miles, or ten thousand miles.\r\n\r\nThere is a more formidable objection, however, to the theory.\r\nThe trade-winds will account for the Gulf-stream, Brazil, Japan,\r\nMozambique, and many other currents; but there are currents, such as\r\nsome of the polar currents, which cannot be so accounted for. Take,\r\nfor example, the great antarctic current flowing northward into the\r\nPacific. This current does not bend to the left under the influence\r\nof the earth’s rotation and continue its course in a north-westerly\r\ndirection, but actually bends round to the right and flows eastward\r\nagainst the South-American coast, in direct opposition both to the\r\ninfluence of rotation and to the trade-winds. The trade-wind theory,\r\ntherefore, is insufficient to account for all the facts. But there is\r\nyet another explanation, which satisfactorily solves our difficulties.\r\nThe currents of the ocean owe their origin, not to the trade-winds\r\nalone, but to the _prevailing_ winds of the globe (including, of\r\ncourse, the trade-winds).\r\n\r\n_Ocean-currents due to the System of Winds._—If we leave out of account\r\na few small inland sheets of water, the globe may be said to have but\r\none sea, just as it possesses only one atmosphere. We have accustomed\r\nourselves, however, to speak of parts or geographical divisions of\r\nthe one great ocean, such as the Atlantic and the Pacific, as if they\r\nwere so many separate oceans. And we have likewise come to regard the\r\ncurrents of the ocean as separate and independent of one another. This\r\nnotion has no doubt to a considerable extent militated against the\r\nacceptance of the theory that the currents are caused by the winds, and\r\nnot by difference of specific gravity; for it leads to the conclusion\r\nthat currents in a sea must flow in the direction of the prevailing\r\nwinds blowing over that particular sea. The proper view of the matter,\r\nas I hope to be able to show, is that which regards the various\r\ncurrents merely as members of one grand system of circulation produced,\r\nnot by the trade-winds alone, nor by the prevailing winds proper alone,\r\nbut by the combined action of all the prevailing winds of the globe,\r\nregarded as one system of circulation.\r\n\r\nIf the winds be the impelling cause of currents, the _direction_ of the\r\ncurrents will depend upon two circumstances, viz.:—(1) the direction\r\nof the prevailing winds of the globe, including, of course, under this\r\nterm the prevailing winds proper and the trade-winds; and (2) the\r\nconformation of land and sea. It follows, therefore, that as a current\r\nin any given sea is but a member of a general system of circulation,\r\nits direction is determined, not alone by the prevailing winds blowing\r\nover the sea in question, but by the general system of prevailing\r\nwinds. It may consequently sometimes happen that the general system\r\nof winds may produce a current directly opposite to the prevailing\r\nwind blowing over the current. The accompanying Chart (Plate I.) shows\r\nhow exactly the system of ocean-currents agrees with the system of\r\nthe prevailing winds. The fine lines indicate the paths of the\r\nprevailing winds, and the fine arrows the direction in which the wind\r\nblows along those paths. The large arrows show the direction of the\r\nprincipal ocean-currents.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: PLATE I.\r\n\r\n  CHART SHOWING THE GENERAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE SYSTEM OF OCEAN\r\n  CURRENTS AND WINDS.\r\n\r\n  W. & A. K. Johnston, Edinb^r. and London.]\r\n\r\nThe directions and paths of the prevailing winds have been taken from\r\nMessrs. Johnston’s small physical Atlas, which, I find, agrees exactly\r\nwith the direction of the prevailing winds as deduced from the four\r\nquarterly wind charts lately published by the Hydrographic Department\r\nof the Admiralty. The direction of the ocean-currents has been taken\r\nfrom the Current-chart published by the Admiralty.\r\n\r\nIn every case, without exception, the direction of the main currents of\r\nthe globe agrees exactly with the direction of the prevailing winds.\r\nThere could not possibly be a more convincing proof that those winds\r\nare the cause of the ocean-currents than this general agreement of the\r\ntwo systems as indicated by the chart. Take, for example, the North\r\nAtlantic. The Gulf-stream follows exactly the path of the prevailing\r\nwinds. The Gulf-stream bifurcates in mid-Atlantic; so does the wind.\r\nThe left branch of the stream passes north-eastwards into the arctic\r\nregions, and the right branch south-eastwards by the Azores; so does\r\nthe wind. The south-eastern branch of the stream, after passing the\r\nCanaries, re-enters the equatorial current and flows into the Gulf\r\nof Mexico; the same, it will be observed, holds true of the wind. A\r\nlike remarkable agreement exists in reference to all the other leading\r\ncurrents of the ocean. This is particularly seen in the case of the\r\ngreat antarctic current between long. 140° W. and 160° W. This current,\r\nflowing northwards from the antarctic regions, instead of bending to\r\nthe left under the influence of rotation, turns to the right when it\r\nenters the regions of the westerly winds, and flows eastwards towards\r\nthe South-American shores. In fact, all the currents in this region of\r\nstrong westerly winds flow in an easterly or north-easterly direction.\r\n\r\nTaking into account the effects resulting from the conformation of\r\nsea and land, the system of ocean-currents agrees precisely with\r\nthe system of the winds. All the principal currents of the globe are\r\nin fact moving in the exact direction in which they ought to move,\r\nassuming the winds to be the sole impelling cause. In short, so perfect\r\nis the agreement between the two systems, that, given the system of\r\nwinds and the conformation of sea and land, and the direction of all\r\nthe currents of the ocean, or more properly the system of oceanic\r\ncirculation, might be determined _à priori_. Or given the system of the\r\nocean-currents together with the conformation of sea and land, and the\r\ndirection of the prevailing winds could also be determined _à priori_.\r\nOr, thirdly, given the system of winds and the system of currents,\r\nand the conformation of sea and land might be roughly determined. For\r\nexample, it can be shown by this means that the antarctic regions\r\nare probably occupied by a continent and not by a number of separate\r\nislands, nor by sea.\r\n\r\nWhile holding that the currents of the ocean form one system of\r\ncirculation, we must not be supposed to mean that the various currents\r\nare connected end to end, having the same water flowing through them\r\nall in succession like that in a heating apparatus. All that is\r\nmaintained is simply this, that the currents are so mutually related\r\nthat any great change in one would modify the conditions of all the\r\nothers. For example, a great increase or decrease in the easterly flow\r\nof antarctic water in the Southern Ocean would decrease or increase,\r\nas the case might be, the strength of the West Australian current;\r\nand this change would modify the equatorial current of the Indian\r\nOcean, a modification which in like manner would affect the Agulhas\r\ncurrent and the Southern Atlantic current—this last leading in turn\r\nto a modification of the equatorial current of the Atlantic, and\r\nconsequently of the Brazilian current and the Gulf-stream. Furthermore,\r\nsince a current impelled by the winds, as Mr. Laughton in his excellent\r\npaper on Ocean-currents justly remarks, tends to leave a vacancy\r\nbehind, it follows that a decrease or increase in the Gulf-stream would\r\naffect the equatorial current, the Agulhas current, and all the other\r\ncurrents back to the antarctic currents. Again, a large modification\r\nin the great antarctic drift-current would in like manner affect all\r\nthe currents of the Pacific. On the other hand, any great change in\r\nthe currents of the Pacific would ultimately affect the currents of\r\nthe Atlantic and Indian Oceans, through its influence on the Cape Horn\r\ncurrent, the South Australian current, and the current passing through\r\nthe Asiatic archipelago; and _vice versâ_, any changes in the currents\r\nof the Atlantic or Indian Oceans would modify the currents of the\r\nPacific.\r\n\r\n_Cause of Gibraltar Current._—I may now consider the cause of the\r\nGibraltar current. There can be little doubt that this current owes its\r\norigin (as Mr. Laughton points out) to the Gulf-stream. “I conceive,”\r\nthat author remarks, “that the Gibraltar current is distinctly a stream\r\nformed by easterly drift of the North Atlantic, which, although it\r\nforms a southerly current on the coast of Portugal, is still strongly\r\npressed to the eastward and seeks the first escape it can find. So\r\ngreat indeed does this pressure seem to be, that more water is forced\r\nthrough the Straits than the Mediterranean can receive, and a part\r\nof it is ejected in reverse currents, some as lateral currents on\r\nthe surface, some, it appears, as an under current at a considerable\r\ndepth.”[95] The funnel-shaped nature of the strait through which the\r\nwater is impelled helps to explain the existence of the under current.\r\nThe water being pressed into the narrow neck of the channel tends to\r\nproduce a slight banking up; and as the pressure urging the water\r\nforward is greatest at the surface and diminishes rapidly downwards,\r\nthe tendency to the restoration of level will cause an underflow\r\ntowards the Atlantic, because below the surface the water will find the\r\npath of least resistance. It is evident indeed that this underflow will\r\nnot take place toward the Mediterranean, from the fact that that sea is\r\nalready filled to overflowing by the current received from the outside\r\nocean.\r\n\r\nIf we examine the Current-chart published by the Hydrographic\r\nDepartment of the Admiralty, we shall find the Gibraltar current\r\nrepresented as merely a continuation of the S.E. flow of Gulf-stream\r\nwater. Now, if the arrows shown upon this chart indicate correctly the\r\ndirection of the flow, we must become convinced that the Gulf-stream\r\nwater cannot possibly avoid passing through the Gibraltar Strait. Of\r\ncourse the excess of evaporation over that of precipitation within\r\nthe Mediterranean area would alone suffice to produce a considerable\r\ncurrent through the Strait; but this of itself would not fill that\r\ninland sea to overflowing.[96]\r\n\r\nThe Atlantic may, in fact, be regarded as an immense whirlpool with the\r\nSaragossa Sea as its vortex; and although it is true, as will be seen\r\nfrom an inspection of the Chart, that the wind blows round the Atlantic\r\nalong the very path taken by the water, impelling the water forward\r\nalong every inch of its course, yet nevertheless it must hold equally\r\ntrue that the water has a tendency to flow off in a straight line at\r\na tangent to the circular course in which it is moving. But the water\r\nis so hemmed in on all sides that it cannot leave this circular path\r\nexcept only at two points; and at these two points it actually does\r\nflow outwards. On the east and west sides the land prevents any such\r\noutflow. Similarly, in the south the escape of the water is frustrated\r\nby the pressure of the opposing currents flowing from that quarter;\r\nwhile in the north it is prevented by the pressure exerted by polar\r\ncurrents from Davis Strait and the Arctic Ocean. But in the Strait of\r\nGibraltar and in the north-eastern portion of the Atlantic between\r\nIceland and the north-eastern shores of Europe there is no resistance\r\noffered: and at these two points an outflow does actually take place.\r\nIn both cases, however, especially the latter, the outflow is greatly\r\naided by the impulse of the prevailing winds.\r\n\r\nNo one, who will glance at the accompanying chart (Plate I.) showing\r\nhow the north-eastern branch of the Gulf-stream bends round and, of\r\ncourse, necessarily presses against the coast, can fail to understand\r\nhow the Atlantic water should be impelled into the Gibraltar Strait,\r\neven although the loss sustained by the Mediterranean from evaporation\r\ndid not exceed the gain from rain and rivers.\r\n\r\n_Theory of Under Currents._—The consideration that ocean-currents are\r\nsimply parts of a system of circulation produced by the system of\r\nprevailing winds, and not by the impulse of the trade-winds alone,\r\nhelps to remove the difficulty which some have in accounting for the\r\nexistence of under currents without referring them to difference of\r\nspecific gravity. Take the case of the Gulf-stream, which passes\r\nunder the polar stream on the west of Spitzbergen, this latter stream\r\npassing in turn under the Gulf-stream a little beyond Bear Island. The\r\npolar streams have their origin in the region of prevailing northerly\r\nwinds, which no doubt extends to the pole. The current flowing past\r\nthe western shores of Spitzbergen, throughout its entire course up\r\nto near the point where it disappears under the warm waters of the\r\nGulf-stream, lies in the region of these same northerly winds. Now why\r\nshould this current cease to be a surface current as soon as it passes\r\nout of the region of northerly into that of south-westerly winds? The\r\nexplanation seems to be this: when the stream enters the region of\r\nprevailing south-westerly winds, its progress southwards along the\r\nsurface of the ocean is retarded both by the wind and by the surface\r\nwater moving in opposition to its course; but being continually pressed\r\nforward by the impulse of the northerly winds acting along its whole\r\ncourse back almost to the pole, perhaps, or as far north at least as\r\nthe sea is not wholly covered with ice, the polar current cannot stop\r\nwhen it enters the region of opposing winds and currents; it must move\r\nforward. But the water thus pressed from behind will naturally take\r\nthe _path of least resistance_. Now in the present case this path will\r\nnecessarily lie at a considerable distance below the surface. Had the\r\npolar stream simply to contend with the Gulf-stream flowing in the\r\nopposite direction, it would probably keep the surface and continue its\r\ncourse along the side of that stream; but it is opposed by the winds,\r\nfrom which it cannot escape except by dipping down under the surface;\r\nand the depth to which it will descend will depend upon the depth of\r\nthe surface current flowing in the opposite direction. There is no\r\nnecessity for supposing a heaping up of the water in order to produce\r\nby pressure a force sufficient to impel the under current. The pressure\r\nof the water from behind is of itself enough. The same explanation, of\r\ncourse, applies to the case of the Gulf-stream passing under the polar\r\nstream. And if we reflect that these under currents are but parts of\r\nthe general system of circulation, and that in most cases they are\r\ncurrents compensating for water drained off at some other quarter, we\r\nneed not wonder at the distance which they may in some cases flow, as,\r\nfor example, from the banks of Newfoundland to the Gulf of Mexico.\r\nThe under currents of the Gulf-stream are necessary to compensate for\r\nthe water impelled southwards by the northerly winds; and again, the\r\npolar under currents are necessary to compensate for the water impelled\r\nnorthward by the south and south-westerly winds.\r\n\r\nBut it may be asked, how do the opposing currents succeed in crossing\r\neach other? It is evident that the Gulf-stream must plunge through\r\nthe whole thickness of the polar stream before it can become an\r\nunder current, and so likewise must the cold water of the polar-flow\r\npass through the genial water of the Gulf-stream in order to get\r\nunderneath it and continue on its course towards the south. The\r\naccompanying diagram (Plate II., Fig. 1) will render this sufficiently\r\nintelligible.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: _Fig. 3_ PLATE II.\r\n\r\n  _Map shewing meeting of the Gulf-stream and Polar Current (from\r\n  D^r. Petermann’s Geographische Mittheilungen._) _The curved lines\r\n  are Isotherms; temperatures are in Fahrenheit._]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: _Fig. 1_\r\n\r\n  _Diagram to shew how two opposing currents intersect each other_]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: _Surface Plan to shew how two opposing currents meet\r\n  each other_\r\n\r\n  W. & A. K. Johnston, Edinb^r. and London.\r\n\r\n  _Fig. 2_]\r\n\r\nNow these two great ocean-currents are so compelled to intersect each\r\nother for the simple reason that they cannot turn aside, the one to the\r\nleft and the other to the right. When two broad streams like those in\r\nquestion are pressed up against each other, they succeed in mutually\r\nintersecting each other’s path by breaking up into bands or belts—the\r\ncold water being invaded and pierced as it were by long tongues of\r\nwarm water, while at the same time the latter is similarly intersected\r\nby corresponding protrusions of cold water. The two streams become\r\nin a manner interlocked, and the one passes through the other very\r\nmuch as we pass the fingers of one hand between the fingers of the\r\nother. The diagram (Plate II., Fig. 2), representing the surface of\r\nthe ocean at the place of meeting of two opposing currents, will show\r\nthis better than description. At the surface the bands necessarily\r\nassume the tongue-shaped appearance represented in the diagram, but\r\nwhen they have succeeded in mutually passing down through the whole\r\nthickness of the opposing currents, they then unite and form two\r\ndefinite under currents, flowing in opposite directions. The polar\r\nbands, after penetrating the Gulf-stream, unite below to form a\r\nsouthward-flowing under current, and in the same way the Gulf-stream\r\nbands, uniting underneath the polar current, continue in their\r\nnortherly course as a broad under current of warm water. That this is\r\na correct representation of what actually occurs in nature becomes\r\nevident from an inspection of the current charts. Thus in the chart\r\nof the North Atlantic which accompanies Dr. Petermann’s Memoir on the\r\nGulf-stream, we observe that south of Spitzbergen the polar current and\r\nthe Gulf-stream are mutually interpenetrated—long tongues invading and\r\ndipping down underneath the Gulf-stream, while in like manner the polar\r\ncurrent becomes similarly intersected by well-marked protrusions of\r\nwarm water flowing from the south. (See Plate II., Fig. 3.)\r\n\r\nNo accurate observations, as far as I know, have been made regarding\r\nthe amount of work performed by the wind in impelling the water\r\nforward; but when we consider the great retarding effect of objects\r\non the earth’s surface, it is quite apparent that the amount of work\r\nperformed on the surface of the ocean must be far greater than is\r\ngenerally supposed. For example, Mr. Buchan, Secretary to the Scottish\r\nMeteorological Society, has shown[97] that a fence made of slabs of\r\nwood three inches in width and three inches apart from each other is a\r\nprotection even during high winds to objects on the lee side of it, and\r\nthat a wire screen with meshes about an inch apart affords protection\r\nduring a gale to flower-pots. The same writer was informed by Mr. Addie\r\nthat such a screen put up at Rockville was torn to pieces by a storm of\r\nwind, the wire screen giving way much in the same way as sails during a\r\nhurricane at sea.\r\n\r\n_The “Challenger’s” Crucial Test of the Wind and Gravitation Theories\r\nof Oceanic Circulation._—It has been shown in former chapters that all\r\nthe facts which have been adduced in support of the gravitation theory\r\nare equally well explained by the wind theory. We may now consider a\r\nclass of facts which do not appear to harmonize with either theory. The\r\nrecent investigations of the _Challenger_ Expedition into the thermal\r\nstate of the ocean reveal a condition of things which appears to me\r\nutterly irreconcilable with the gravitation theory.\r\n\r\nIt is a condition absolutely essential to the gravitation theory that\r\nthe surface of the ocean should be highest in equatorial regions and\r\nslope downwards to either pole. Were water absolutely frictionless, an\r\nincline, however small, would be sufficient to produce a surface-flow\r\nfrom the equator to the poles, but to induce such an effect some slope\r\nthere must be, or gravitation could exercise no power in drawing the\r\nsurface-water polewards.\r\n\r\nThe researches of the _Challenger_ Expedition bring to light the\r\nstriking and important fact that the general surface of the North\r\nAtlantic in order to produce equilibrium must stand at a higher level\r\nthan at the equator. In other words the surface of the Atlantic is\r\nlowest at the equator, and rises with a gentle slope to well-nigh the\r\nlatitude of England. If this be the case, then it is mechanically\r\nimpossible that, as far as the North Atlantic is concerned, there can\r\nbe any such general movement as Dr. Carpenter believes. Gravitation can\r\nno more cause the surface-water of the Atlantic to flow towards the\r\narctic regions than it can compel the waters of the Gulf of Mexico up\r\nthe Mississippi into the Missouri. The impossibility is equally great\r\nin both cases.\r\n\r\nIn order to prove what has been stated, let us take a section of the\r\nmid-Atlantic, north and south, across the equator; and, to give the\r\ngravitation theory every advantage, let us select that particular\r\nsection adopted by Dr. Carpenter as the one of all others most\r\nfavourable to his theory, viz., Section marked No. VIII. in his memoir\r\nlately read before the Royal Geographical Society.[98]\r\n\r\nThe fact that the polar cold water comes so near the surface at the\r\nequator is regarded by Dr. Carpenter as evidence in favour of the\r\ngravitation theory. On first looking at Dr. Carpenter’s section it\r\nforcibly struck me that if it was accurately drawn, the ocean to be\r\nin equilibrium would require to stand at a higher level in the North\r\nAtlantic than at the equator. In order, therefore, to determine\r\nwhether this is the case or not I asked the hydrographer of the\r\nAdmiralty to favour me with the temperature soundings indicated in the\r\nsection, a favour which was most obligingly granted. The following\r\nare the temperature soundings at the three stations A, B, and C. The\r\ntemperature of C are the mean of six soundings taken along near the\r\nequator:—\r\n\r\n  +--------+----------------+----------------+----------------------+\r\n  |        |       A        |       B        |          C           |\r\n  |        |                |                |                      |\r\n  | Depth  |Lat. 37° 54′ N. |Lat. 23° 10′ N. |     Mean of six      |\r\n  |   in   |Long. 41° 44′ W.|Long. 38° 42′ W.|temperature soundings |\r\n  |Fathoms.|                |                |    near equator.     |\r\n  |        |                |                +---------+------------+\r\n  |        |  Temperature.  |  Temperature.  | Depth in|Temperature.|\r\n  |        |                |                | Fathoms.|            |\r\n  +--------+----------------+----------------+---------+------------+\r\n  |        |       °        |        °       |         |      °     |\r\n  |Surface.|     70·0       |      72·0      |Surface. |    77·9    |\r\n  |   100  |     63·5       |      67·0      |    10   |    77·2    |\r\n  |   200  |     60·6       |      57·6      |    20   |    77·1    |\r\n  |   300  |     60·0       |      52·5      |    30   |    76·9    |\r\n  |   400  |     54·8       |      47·7      |    40   |    71·7    |\r\n  |   500  |     46·7       |      43·7      |    50   |    64·0    |\r\n  |   600  |     41·6       |      41·7      |    60   |    60·4    |\r\n  |   700  |     40·6       |      40·6      |    70   |    59·4    |\r\n  |   800  |     38·1       |      39·4      |    80   |    58·0    |\r\n  |   900  |     37·8       |      39·2      |    90   |    58·0    |\r\n  |  1000  |     37·9       |      38·3      |   100   |    55·6    |\r\n  |  1100  |     37·1       |      38·0      |   150   |    51·0    |\r\n  |  1200  |     37·1       |      37·6      |   200   |    46·6    |\r\n  |  1300  |     37·2       |      36·7      |   300   |    42·2    |\r\n  |  1400  |     37·1       |      36·9      |   400   |    40·3    |\r\n  |  1500  |      ..        |      36·7      |   500   |    38·9    |\r\n  |  2700  |     35·2       |       ..       |   600   |    39·2    |\r\n  |  2720  |      ..        |      35·4      |   700   |    39·0    |\r\n  |        |                |                |   800   |    39·1    |\r\n  |        |                |                |   900   |    38·2    |\r\n  |        |                |                |  1000   |    36·9    |\r\n  |        |                |                |  1100   |    37·6    |\r\n  |        |                |                |  1200   |    36·7    |\r\n  |        |                |                |  1300   |    35·8    |\r\n  |        |                |                |  1400   |    36·4    |\r\n  |        |                |                |  1500   |    36·1    |\r\n  |        |                |                | Bottom. |    34·7    |\r\n  +--------+----------------+----------------+---------+------------+\r\n\r\nOn computing the extent to which the three columns A, B, and C are each\r\nexpanded by heat according to Muncke’s table of the expansion of sea\r\nwater for every degree Fahrenheit, I found that column B, in order to\r\nbe in equilibrium with C (the equatorial column), would require to have\r\nits surface standing fully 2 feet 6 inches above the level of column C,\r\nand column A fully 3 feet 6 inches above that column. In short, it is\r\nevident that there must be a gradual rise from the equator to latitude\r\n38° N. of 3½ feet. Any one can verify the accuracy of these results by\r\nmaking the necessary computations for himself.[99]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: PLATE III.\r\n\r\n  W. & A. K. Johnston, Edinb^r. and London.\r\n\r\n  SECTION OF THE ATLANTIC nearly North and South, between LAT. 38° N.\r\n  & LAT. 38° S.]\r\n\r\nI may observe that, had column C extended to the same depth as columns\r\nA and B, the difference of level would be considerably greater, for\r\ncolumn C requires to balance only that portion of columns A and B\r\nwhich lies above the level of its base. Suppose a depth of ocean equal\r\nto that of column C to extend to the north pole, and the polar water\r\nto have a uniform temperature of 32° from the surface to the bottom,\r\nthen, in order to produce equilibrium, the surface of the ocean at\r\nthe equator would require to be 4 feet 6 inches above that at the\r\npole. But the surface of the ocean at B would be 7 feet, and at A 8\r\nfeet, above the poles. Gravitation never could have caused the ocean\r\nto assume this form. It is impossible that this immense mass of warm\r\nwater, extending to such a depth in the North Atlantic, could have been\r\nbrought from equatorial regions by means of gravitation. And, even\r\nif we suppose this accumulation of warm water can be accounted for\r\nby some other means, still its presence precludes the possibility of\r\nany such surface-flow as that advocated by Dr. Carpenter. For so long\r\nas the North Atlantic stands 3½ feet above the level of the equator,\r\ngravitation can never move the equatorial waters polewards.\r\n\r\nThere is another feature of this section irreconcilable with the\r\ngravitation theory. It will be observed that the accumulation of warm\r\nwater is all in the North Atlantic, and that there is little or none\r\nin the south. But according to the gravitation theory it ought to\r\nhave been the reverse. For owing to the unrestricted communication\r\nbetween the equatorial and antarctic regions, the general flow of\r\nwater towards the south pole is, according to that theory, supposed to\r\nbe greater than towards the north, and consequently the quantity of\r\nwarm equatorial water in the South Atlantic ought also to be greater.\r\nDr. Carpenter himself seems to be aware of this difficulty besetting\r\nthe theory, and meets it by stating that “the upper stratum of the\r\nNorth Atlantic is not nearly as much cooled down by its limited polar\r\nunderflow, as that of the South Atlantic is by the vast movement of\r\nantarctic water which is constantly taking place towards the equator.”\r\nBut this “vast movement of antarctic water” necessarily implies a vast\r\ncounter-movement of warm surface-water. So that if there is more polar\r\nwater in the South Atlantic to produce the cooling effect, there should\r\nlikewise be more warm water to be cooled.\r\n\r\nAccording to the wind theory of oceanic circulation the explanation of\r\nthe whole phenomena is simple and obvious. It has already been shown\r\nthat owing to the fact that the S. E. trades are stronger than the N.\r\nE., and blow constantly over upon the northern hemisphere, the warm\r\nsurface-water of the South Atlantic is drifted across the equator. It\r\nis then carried by the equatorial current into the Gulf of Mexico, and\r\nafterwards of course forms a part of the Gulf-stream.\r\n\r\nThe North Atlantic, on the other hand, not only does not lose its\r\nsurface heat like the equatorial and South Atlantic, but it receives\r\nfrom the Gulf-stream in the form of warm water an amount of heat, as we\r\nhave seen, equal to one-fourth of all the heat which it receives from\r\nthe sun. The reason why the warm surface strata are so much thicker\r\non the North Atlantic than on the equatorial regions is perfectly\r\nobvious. The surface-water at the equator is swept into the Gulf of\r\nMexico by the trade-winds and the equatorial current, as rapidly as it\r\nis heated by the sun, so that it has not time to gather to any great\r\ndepth. But all this warm water is carried by the Gulf-stream into the\r\nNorth Atlantic, where it accumulates. That this great depth of warm\r\nwater in the North Atlantic, represented in the section, is derived\r\nfrom the Gulf-stream, and not from a direct flow from the equator due\r\nto gravitation, is further evident from the fact that temperature\r\nsounding A in latitude 38° N. is made through that immense body of warm\r\nwater, upwards of 300 fathoms thick, extending from Bermuda to near the\r\nAzores, discovered by the _Challenger_ Expedition, and justly regarded\r\nby Captain Nares as an offshoot of the Gulf-stream. This, in Captain\r\nNares’s Report, is No. 8 “temperature sounding,” between Bermuda and\r\nthe Azores; sounding B is No. 6 “temperature curve,” between Teneriffe\r\nand St. Thomas.\r\n\r\nThere is an additional reason to the one already stated why the\r\nsurface temperature of the South Atlantic should be so much below\r\nthat of the North. It is perfectly true that whatever amount of water\r\nis transferred from the southern hemisphere to the northern must be\r\ncompensated by an equal amount from the northern to the southern\r\nhemisphere, nevertheless the warm water which is carried off the South\r\nAtlantic by the winds is not directly compensated by water from the\r\nnorth, but by that cold antarctic current whose existence is so well\r\nknown to mariners from the immense masses of ice which it brings from\r\nthe Southern Ocean.\r\n\r\n_Thermal Condition of Southern Ocean._——The thermal condition of the\r\nSouthern Ocean, as ascertained by the _Challenger_ Expedition, appears\r\nto me to be also irreconcilable with the gravitation theory. Between\r\nthe parallels of latitude 65° 42′ S. and 50° 1′ S., the ocean, with\r\nthe exception of a thin stratum at the surface heated by the sun’s\r\nrays, was found, down to the depth of about 200 fathoms, to be several\r\ndegrees colder than the water underneath.[100] The cold upper stratum\r\nis evidently an antarctic current, and the warm underlying water an\r\nequatorial under current. But, according to the gravitation theory, the\r\ncolder water should be underneath.\r\n\r\nThe very fact of a mass of water, 200 fathoms deep and extending over\r\nfifteen degrees of latitude, remaining above water of three or four\r\ndegrees higher temperature shows how little influence difference of\r\ntemperature has in producing motion. If it had the potency which some\r\nattribute to it, one would suppose that this cold stratum should sink\r\ndown and displace the warm water underneath. If difference of density\r\nis sufficient to move the water horizontally, surely it must be more\r\nthan sufficient to cause it to sink vertically.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n     THE WIND THEORY OF OCEANIC CIRCULATION IN RELATION TO CHANGE\r\n                              OF CLIMATE.\r\n\r\n  Direction of Currents depends on Direction of the Winds.—Causes\r\n      which affect the Direction of Currents will affect\r\n      Climate.—How Change of Eccentricity affects the Mode\r\n      of Distribution of the Winds.—Mutual Reaction of Cause\r\n      and Effect.—Displacement of the Great Equatorial\r\n      Current.—Displacement of the Median Line between the Trades,\r\n      and its Effect on Currents.—Ocean-currents in Relation to the\r\n      Distribution of Plants and Animals.—Alternate Cold and Warm\r\n      Periods in North and South.—Mr. Darwin’s Views quoted.—How\r\n      Glaciers at the Equator may be accounted for.—Migration\r\n      across the Equator.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ocean-currents in Relation to Change of Climate._—In my attempts to\r\nprove that oceanic circulation is produced by the winds and not by\r\ndifference of specific gravity, and that ocean-currents are the great\r\ndistributors of heat over the globe, my chief aim has been to show\r\nthe bearing which these points have on the grand question of secular\r\nchanges of climate during geological epochs, more particularly in\r\nreference to that mystery the cause of the glacial epoch.\r\n\r\nIn concluding this discussion regarding oceanic circulation, I may\r\ntherefore be allowed briefly to recapitulate those points connected\r\nwith the subject which seem to shed most light on the question of\r\nchanges of climate.\r\n\r\nThe complete agreement between the systems of ocean-currents and\r\nwinds not only shows that the winds are the impelling cause of the\r\ncurrents, but it also indicates to what an extent the _directions_ of\r\nthe currents are determined by the winds, or, more properly, to what an\r\nextent their directions are determined by the _direction_ of the winds.\r\n\r\nWe have seen in Chapter II. to what an enormous extent the climatic\r\nconditions of the globe are dependent on the distribution of heat\r\neffected by means of ocean-currents. It has been there pointed out\r\nthat, if the heat conveyed from inter-tropical to temperate and polar\r\nregions by oceanic circulation were restored to the former, the\r\nequatorial regions would then have a temperature about 55° warmer,\r\nand the high polar regions a climate 83° colder than at present. It\r\nfollows, therefore, that any cause which will greatly affect the\r\ncurrents or greatly change their paths and mode of distribution, will\r\nof necessity seriously affect the climatic condition of the globe. But\r\nas the existence of these currents depends on the winds, and their\r\ndirection and form of distribution depend upon the direction and form\r\nof distribution of the winds, any cause which will greatly affect the\r\nwinds will also greatly affect the currents, and consequently will\r\ninfluence the climatic condition of the globe. Again, as the existence\r\nof the winds depends mainly on the difference of temperature between\r\nequatorial and polar regions, any cause which will greatly affect this\r\ndifference of temperature will likewise greatly affect the winds; and\r\nthese will just as surely react on the currents and climatic conditions\r\nof the globe. A simple increase or decrease in the difference of\r\ntemperature between equatorial and polar regions, though it would\r\ncertainly produce an increase or a decrease, as the case might be, in\r\nthe strength of the winds, and consequently in the strength of the\r\ncurrents, would not, however, greatly affect the mode of _distribution_\r\nof the winds, nor, as a consequence, the mode of _distribution_ of\r\nthe currents. But although a simple change in the difference of\r\ntemperature between the equator and the poles would not produce a\r\ndifferent _distribution_ of aërial, and consequently of ocean-currents,\r\nnevertheless a _difference in the difference_ of temperature between\r\nthe equator and the two poles would do so; that is to say, any cause\r\nthat should increase the difference of temperature between the equator\r\nand the pole on the one hemisphere, and decrease that difference on\r\nthe other, would effect a change in the distribution of the aërial\r\ncurrents, which change would in turn produce a corresponding change in\r\nthe distribution of ocean-currents.\r\n\r\nIt has been shown[101] that an increase in the eccentricity of the\r\nearth’s orbit tends to lower the temperature of the one hemisphere and\r\nto raise the temperature of the other. It is true that an increase of\r\neccentricity does not afford more heat to the one hemisphere than to\r\nthe other; nevertheless it brings about a condition of things which\r\ntends to lower the temperature of the one hemisphere and to raise the\r\ntemperature of the other. Let us imagine the eccentricity to be at its\r\nsuperior limit, 0·07775, and the winter solstice in the aphelion. The\r\nmidwinter temperature, owing to the increased distance of the sun,\r\nwould be lowered enormously; and the effect of this would be to cause\r\nall the moisture which now falls as rain during winter in temperate\r\nregions to fall as snow. Nor is this all; the winters would not merely\r\nbe colder than now, but they would also be much longer. At present the\r\nsummer half-year exceeds the winter half year by nearly eight days; but\r\nat the period in question the winters would be longer than the summers\r\nby upwards of thirty-six days. The heat of the sun during the short\r\nsummer, for reasons which have already been explained, would not be\r\nsufficient to melt the snow of winter; so that gradually, year by year,\r\nthe snow would continue to accumulate on the ground.\r\n\r\nOn the southern hemisphere the opposite condition of things would\r\nobtain. Owing to the nearness of the sun during the winter of that\r\nhemisphere, the moisture of the air would be precipitated as rain in\r\nregions where at present it falls as snow. This and the shortness of\r\nthe winter would tend to produce a decrease in the quantity of snow.\r\nThe difference of temperature between the equatorial and the temperate\r\nand polar regions would therefore be greater on the northern than on\r\nthe southern hemisphere; and, as a consequence, the aërial currents\r\nof the former hemisphere would be stronger than those of the latter.\r\nThis would be more especially the case with the trade-winds. The\r\nN.E. trades being stronger than the S.E. trades would blow across the\r\nequator, and the median line between them would therefore be at some\r\ndistance to the south of the equator. Thus the equatorial waters would\r\nbe impelled more to the southern than to the northern hemisphere; and\r\nthe warm water carried over in this manner to the southern hemisphere\r\nwould tend to increase the difference of temperature between the two\r\nhemispheres. This change, again, would in turn tend to strengthen the\r\nN.E. and to weaken the S.E. trades, and would thus induce a still\r\ngreater flow of equatorial waters into the southern hemisphere—a\r\nresult which would still more increase the difference of temperature\r\nbetween the northern and southern hemisphere, and so on—the one cause\r\nso reacting on the other as to increase its effects, as was shown at\r\nlength in Chapter IV.\r\n\r\nIt was this mutual reaction of those physical agents which led, as was\r\npointed out in Chapter IV., to that extraordinary condition of climate\r\nwhich prevailed during the glacial epoch.\r\n\r\nThere is another circumstance to be considered which perhaps more\r\nthan any thing else would tend to lower the temperature of the one\r\nhemisphere and to raise the temperature of the other; and this is\r\nthe _displacement of the great equatorial current_. During a glacial\r\nperiod in the northern hemisphere the median line between the trades\r\nwould be shifted very considerably south of the equator; and the same\r\nwould necessarily be the case with the great equatorial currents, the\r\nonly difference being that the equatorial currents, other things being\r\nequal, would be deflected farther south than the median line. For the\r\nwater impelled by the strong N.E. trades would be moving with greater\r\nvelocity than the waters impelled by the weaker S.E. trades, and, of\r\ncourse, would cross the median line of the trades before its progress\r\nsouthwards could be arrested by the counteracting influence of the S.E.\r\ntrades. Let us glance briefly at the results which would follow from\r\nsuch a condition of things. In the first place, as was shown on former\r\noccasions,[102] were the equatorial current of the Atlantic (the feeder\r\nof the Gulf-stream) shifted considerably south of its present position,\r\nit would not bifurcate, as it now does, off Cape St. Roque, owing to\r\nthe fact that the whole of the waters would strike obliquely against\r\nthe Brazilian coast and thus be deflected into the Southern Ocean. The\r\neffect produced on the climate of the North Atlantic and North-Western\r\nEurope by the withdrawal of the water forming the Gulf-stream, may be\r\nconceived from what has already been stated concerning the amount of\r\nheat conveyed by that stream. The heat thus withdrawn from the North\r\nAtlantic would go to raise the temperature of the Southern Ocean and\r\nantarctic regions. A similar result would take place in the Pacific\r\nOcean. Were the equatorial current of that ocean removed greatly to\r\nthe south of its present position, it would not then impinge and be\r\ndeflected upon the Asiatic coast, but upon the continent of Australia;\r\nand the greater portion of its waters would then pass southward into\r\nthe Southern Ocean, while that portion passing round the north of\r\nAustralia (owing to the great strength of the N.E. trades) would rather\r\nflow into the Indian Ocean than turn round, as now, along the east\r\ncoast of Asia by the Japan Islands. The stoppage of the Japan current,\r\ncombined with the displacement of the equatorial current to the south\r\nof the equator, would greatly lower the temperature of the whole of the\r\nNorth Pacific and adjoining continents, and raise to a corresponding\r\ndegree the temperature of the South Pacific and Southern Ocean. Again,\r\nthe waters of the equatorial current of the Indian Ocean (owing to the\r\nopposing N.E. trades), would not, as at present, find their way round\r\nthe Cape of Good Hope into the North Atlantic, but would be deflected\r\nsouthwards into the Antarctic Sea.\r\n\r\nWe have in the present state of things a striking example of the extent\r\nto which the median line between the two trades may be shifted, and the\r\nposition of the great equatorial currents of the ocean may be affected,\r\nby a slight difference in the relative strength of the two aërial\r\ncurrents. The S.E. trades are at present a little stronger than the\r\nN.E.; and the consequence is that they blow across the equator into the\r\nnorthern hemisphere to a distance sometimes of 10 or 15°, so that the\r\nmean position of the median line lies at least 6 or 7 degrees north of\r\nthe equator.\r\n\r\nAnd it is doubtless owing to the superior strength of the S.E. trades\r\nthat so much warm water crosses the equator from the South to the North\r\nAtlantic, and that the main portion of the equatorial current flows\r\ninto the Caribbean Sea rather than along the Brazilian coast. Were the\r\ntwo trades of equal strength, the transference of heat into the North\r\nAtlantic from the southern hemisphere by means of the Southern Atlantic\r\nand equatorial currents would be much less than at present. The same\r\nwould also hold true in regard to the Pacific.\r\n\r\n_Ocean-currents in Relation to the Distribution of Plants and\r\nAnimals._—In the fifth and last editions of the “Origin of Species,”\r\nMr. Darwin has done me the honour to express his belief that the\r\nforegoing view regarding alternate cold and warm periods in north\r\nand south during the glacial epoch explains a great many facts in\r\nconnection with the distribution of plants and animals which have\r\nalways been regarded as exceedingly puzzling.\r\n\r\nThere are certain species of plants which occur alike in the temperate\r\nregions of the southern and northern hemispheres. At the equator these\r\nsame temperate forms are found on elevated mountains, but not on the\r\nlowlands. How, then, did these temperate forms manage to cross the\r\nequator from the northern temperate regions to the southern, and _vice\r\nversâ_? Mr. Darwin’s solution of the problem is (in his own words) as\r\nfollows:—\r\n\r\n“As the cold became more and more intense, we know that arctic forms\r\ninvaded the temperate regions; and from the facts just given, there\r\ncan hardly be a doubt that some of the more vigorous, dominant, and\r\nwidest-spreading temperate forms invaded the equatorial lowlands.\r\nThe inhabitants of these hot lowlands would at the same time have\r\nmigrated to the tropical and subtropical regions of the south; for the\r\nsouthern hemisphere was at this period warmer. On the decline of the\r\nglacial period, as both hemispheres gradually recovered their former\r\ntemperatures, the northern temperate forms living on the lowlands under\r\nthe equator would have been driven to their former homes or have been\r\ndestroyed, being replaced by the equatorial forms returning from the\r\nsouth. Some, however, of the northern temperate forms would almost\r\ncertainly have ascended any adjoining high land, where, if sufficiently\r\nlofty, they would have long survived like the arctic forms on the\r\nmountains of Europe.”\r\n\r\n“In the regular course of events the southern hemisphere would in\r\nits turn be subjected to a severe glacial period, with the northern\r\nhemisphere rendered warmer; and then the southern temperate forms\r\nwould invade the equatorial lowlands. The northern forms which had\r\nbefore been left on the mountains would now descend and mingle with the\r\nsouthern forms. These latter, when the warmth returned, would return\r\nto their former homes, leaving some few species on the mountains, and\r\ncarrying southward with them some of the northern temperate forms which\r\nhad descended from their mountain fastnesses. Thus we should have some\r\nfew species identically the same in the northern and southern temperate\r\nzones and on the mountains of the intermediate tropical regions” (p.\r\n339, sixth edition).\r\n\r\nAdditional light is cast on this subject by the results already stated\r\nin regard to the enormous extent to which the temperature of the\r\nequator is affected by ocean-currents. Were there no transferrence of\r\nheat from equatorial to temperate and polar regions, the temperature\r\nof the equator, as has been remarked, would probably be about 55°\r\nwarmer than at present. In such a case no plant existing on the face of\r\nthe globe could live at the equator unless on some elevated mountain\r\nregion. On the other hand, were the quantity of warm water which is\r\nbeing transferred from the equator to be very much increased, the\r\ntemperature of inter-tropical latitudes might be so lowered as easily\r\nto admit of temperate species of plants growing at the equator. A\r\nlowering of the temperature at the equator some 20° or 30° is all that\r\nwould be required; and only a moderate increase in the volume of the\r\ncurrents proceeding from the equator, taken in connection with the\r\neffects flowing from the following considerations, might suffice to\r\nproduce that result. During the glacial epoch, when the one hemisphere\r\nwas under ice and the other enjoying a warm and equable climate, the\r\nmedian line between the trades may have been shifted to almost the\r\ntropical line of the warm hemisphere. Under such a condition of things\r\nthe warmest part would probably be somewhere about the tropic of the\r\nwarm hemisphere, and not, as now, at the equator; for since all, or\r\nnearly all, the surface-water of the equator would then be impelled\r\nover to the warm hemisphere, the tropical regions of that hemisphere\r\nwould be receiving nearly double their present amount of warm water.\r\n\r\nAgain, as the equatorial current at this time would be shifted towards\r\nthe tropic of the warm hemisphere, the surface-water would not, as at\r\npresent, be flowing in equatorial regions parallel to the equator,\r\nbut obliquely across it from the cold to the warm hemisphere. This of\r\nitself would tend greatly to lower the temperature of the equator.\r\n\r\nIt follows, therefore, as a necessary consequence, that during the\r\nglacial epoch, when the one hemisphere was under snow and ice and\r\nthe other enjoying a warm and equable climate, the temperature of\r\nthe equator would be lower than at present. But when the glaciated\r\nhemisphere (which we may assume to be the northern) began to grow\r\nwarmer and the climate of the southern or warm hemisphere to get\r\ncolder, the median line of the trades and the equatorial currents\r\nof the ocean also would begin to move back from the southern tropic\r\ntowards the equator. This would cause the temperature of the equator\r\nto rise and to continue rising until the equatorial currents reached\r\ntheir normal position. When the snow began to accumulate on the\r\nsouthern hemisphere and to disappear on the northern, the median line\r\nof the trades and the equatorial currents of the ocean would then\r\nbegin to move towards the northern tropic as they had formerly towards\r\nthe southern. The temperature of the equator would then again begin\r\nto sink, and continue to do so until the glaciation of the southern\r\nhemisphere reached its maximum. This oscillation of the thermal equator\r\nto and fro across the geographical equator would continue so long as\r\nthe alternate glaciation of the two hemispheres continued.\r\n\r\nThis lowering of the temperature of the equator during the severest\r\npart of the glacial epoch will help to explain the former existence of\r\nglaciers in inter-tropical regions at no very great elevation above the\r\nsea-level, evidence of which appears recently to have been found by\r\nProfessor Agassiz, Mr. Belt, and others.\r\n\r\nThe glacial _epoch_ may be considered as contemporaneous in both\r\nhemispheres. But the epoch consisted of a succession of cold and warm\r\n_periods_, the cold periods of one hemisphere coinciding with the warm\r\nperiods of the other, and _vice versâ_.\r\n\r\n_Migration across the Equator._—Mr. Belt[103] and others have felt\r\nsome difficulty in understanding how, according to theory, the plants\r\nand animals of temperate regions could manage to migrate from one\r\nhemisphere to the other, seeing that in their passage they would have\r\nto cross the thermal equator. The oscillation to and fro of the thermal\r\nequator across the geographical, removes every difficulty in regard to\r\nhow the migration takes place. When, for example, a cold period on the\r\nnorthern hemisphere and the corresponding warm one on the southern were\r\nat their maximum, the thermal equator would by this time have probably\r\npassed beyond the Tropic of Capricorn. The geographical equator would\r\nthen be enjoying a subtropical, if not a temperate condition of\r\nclimate, and the plants and animals of the northern hemisphere would\r\nmanage then to reach the equator. When the cold began to abate on\r\nthe northern and to increase on the southern hemisphere, the thermal\r\nequator would commence its retreat towards the geographical. The plants\r\nand animals from the north, in order to escape the increasing heat as\r\nthe thermal equator approached them, would begin to ascend the mountain\r\nheights; and when that equator had passed to its northern limit, and\r\nthe geographical equator was again enjoying a subtropical condition of\r\nclimate, the plants and animals would begin to descend and pursue their\r\njourney southwards as the cold abated on the southern hemisphere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n                      WARM INTER-GLACIAL PERIODS.\r\n\r\n  Alternate Cold and Warm Periods.—Warm Inter-glacial Periods\r\n      a Test of Theories.—Reason why their Occurrence has not\r\n      been hitherto recognised.—Instances of Warm Inter-glacial\r\n      Periods.—Dranse, Dürnten, Hoxne, Chapelhall, Craiglockhart,\r\n      Leith Walk, Redhall Quarry, Beith, Crofthead, Kilmaurs,\r\n      Sweden, Ohio, Cromer, Mundesley, &c., &c.—Cave and River\r\n      Deposits.—Occurrence of Arctic and Warm Animals in some Beds\r\n      accounted for.—Mr. Boyd Dawkins’s Objections.—Occurrence\r\n      of Southern Shells in Glacial Deposits.—Evidence of Warm\r\n      Inter-glacial Periods from Mineral Borings.—Striated\r\n      Pavements.—Reason why Inter-glacial Land-surfaces are so rare.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Alternate Cold and Warm Periods._—If the theory developed in the\r\nforegoing chapters in reference to the cause of secular changes of\r\nclimate be correct, it follows that that long age known as the glacial\r\nepoch did not, as has hitherto been generally supposed, consist of one\r\nlong unbroken period of cold and ice. Neither did it consist, as some\r\nhave concluded, of two long periods of ice with an intervening mild\r\nperiod, but it must have consisted of a long succession of cold and\r\nwarm periods; the warm periods of the one hemisphere corresponding in\r\ntime with the cold periods of the other and _vice versâ_. It follows\r\nalso from theory that as the cold periods became more and more severe,\r\nthe warm intervening periods would become more and more warm and\r\nequable. As the ice began to accumulate during the cold periods in\r\nsubarctic and temperate regions in places where it previously did not\r\nexist, so in like manner during the corresponding warm periods it would\r\nbegin to disappear in arctic regions where it had held enduring sway\r\nthroughout the now closing cycle. As the cold periods in the southern\r\nhemisphere became more and more severe, the ice would continue to\r\nadvance northwards in the temperate regions; but at that very same\r\ntime the intervening warm periods in the northern hemisphere would\r\nbecome warmer and warmer and more equable, and the ice of the arctic\r\nregions would continue to disappear farther and farther to the north,\r\ntill by the time that the ice had reached a maximum during the cold\r\nantarctic periods, Greenland and the arctic regions would, during the\r\nwarm intervening periods, be probably free of ice and enjoying a mild\r\nand equable climate. Or we may say that as the one hemisphere became\r\ncold the other became warm, and when the cold reached a maximum in the\r\none hemisphere, the warmth would reach a maximum in the other. The time\r\nwhen the ice had reached its greatest extension on the one hemisphere\r\nwould be the time when it had disappeared from the other.\r\n\r\n_Inter-glacial Periods a Test of Theories._—Here we have the grand\r\ncrucial test of the truth of the foregoing theory of the cause of\r\nthe glacial epoch. That the glacial epoch should have consisted of a\r\nsuccession of cold and warm periods is utterly inconsistent with all\r\nprevious theories which have been advanced to account for it. What,\r\nthen, is the evidence of geology on this subject? If the glacial epoch\r\ncan be proved from geological evidence to have consisted of such a\r\nsuccession of cold and warm periods, then I have little doubt but the\r\ntheory will soon be generally accepted. But at the very outset an\r\nobjection meets us, viz., why call an epoch, which consisted as much of\r\nwarm periods as of cold, a glacial epoch, or an “Ice Age,” as Mr. James\r\nGeikie tersely expresses it? Why not as well call it a warm epoch as a\r\ncold one, seeing that, according to theory, it was just as much a warm\r\nas a cold epoch? The answer to this objection will be fully discussed\r\nin the chapter on the Reason of the Imperfection of Geological Records.\r\nBut in the meantime, I may remark that it will be shown that the epoch\r\nknown as the glacial has been justly called the glacial epoch or “Ice\r\nAge,” because the geological evidences of the cold periods remain in\r\na remarkably perfect state, whilst the evidences of the warm periods\r\nhave to a great extent disappeared. The reason of this difference\r\nin the two cases will be discussed in the chapter to which I have\r\nreferred. Besides, the condition of things during the cold periods was\r\nso extraordinary, so exceptional, so totally different from those now\r\nprevailing, that even supposing the geological records of the warm\r\nperiods had been as well preserved as those of the cold, nevertheless\r\nwe should have termed the epoch in question a glacial epoch. There\r\nis yet another reason, however, for our limited knowledge of warm\r\ninter-glacial periods. Till very lately, little or no attention was\r\npaid by geologists to this part of the subject in the way of keeping\r\nrecords of cases of inter-glacial deposits which, from time to time,\r\nhave been observed. Few geologists ever dreamt of such a thing as\r\nwarm periods during the age of ice, so that when intercalated beds of\r\nsand and gravel, beds of peat, roots, branches, trunks, leaves, and\r\nfruits of trees were found in the boulder clay, no physical importance\r\nwas attached to them, and consequently no description or record of\r\nthem ever kept. In fact, all such examples were regarded as purely\r\naccidental and exceptional, and were considered not worthy of any\r\nspecial attention. A case which came under my own observation will\r\nillustrate my meaning. An intelligent geologist, some years ago, read a\r\npaper before one of our local geological societies, giving an account\r\nof a fossiliferous bed of clay found intercalated between two distinct\r\nbeds of till. In this intercalated bed were found rootlets and stems of\r\ntrees, nuts, and other remains, showing that it had evidently been an\r\nold inter-glacial land surface. In the transactions of the society a\r\ndescription of the two beds of till was given, but no mention whatever\r\nwas made of the intercalated bed containing the organic remains,\r\nalthough this was the only point of any real importance.\r\n\r\nSince the theory that the glacial epoch resulted from a high state\r\nof eccentricity of the earth’s orbit began to receive some little\r\nacceptance, geologists have paid a good deal of attention to cases of\r\nintercalated beds in the till containing organic remains, and the\r\nresult is that we have already a great body of evidence of a geological\r\nnature in favour of warm inter-glacial periods, and I have little\r\ndoubt that in the course of a few years the former occurrence of warm\r\ninter-glacial periods will be universally admitted.\r\n\r\nI shall now proceed to give a very brief outline of the evidence\r\nbearing on the subject. But the cases to which I shall have to refer\r\nare much too numerous to allow me to enter into details.\r\n\r\n_Inter-glacial Beds of Switzerland._—The first geologist, so far as I\r\nam aware, who directed attention to evidence of a break in the cold of\r\nthe glacial epoch was M. Morlot. It is now twenty years ago since he\r\nannounced the existence of a warm period during the glacial epoch from\r\ngeological evidence connected with the glacial drift of the Alps.[104]\r\n\r\nThe rivers of Switzerland, he found, show on their banks three\r\nwell-marked terraces of regularly stratified and well-rounded shingle,\r\nidentical with the modern deposits of the rivers. They stand at 50,\r\n100, and 150 feet above the present level of the rivers. These terraces\r\nwere evidently formed by the present system of rivers when these flowed\r\nat a higher level, and extend up the Alps to a height of from 3,000 to\r\n4,000 feet above the level of the sea. There is a terrace bordering the\r\nRhine at Camischollas, above Disentis, 4,400 feet above the level of\r\nthe sea, proving that during the period of its formation the Alps were\r\nfree of ice up to the height of 4,400 feet above the sea-level. It is\r\nwell known that a glacial period must have succeeded the formation of\r\nthese drifts, for they are in many places covered with erratics. At\r\nGeneva, for example, an erratic drift nearly 50 feet thick is seen to\r\nrest on the drift of the middle terrace, which rises 100 feet above the\r\nlevel of the lake. But it is also evident that a glacial period must\r\nhave preceded the formation of the drift beds, for they are found to\r\nlie in many places upon the unstratified boulder clay or _till_. M.\r\nMorlot observed in the neighbourhood of Clareus, from 7 to 9 feet of\r\ndrift resting upon a bed of true till 40 feet thick; the latter was\r\ncomposed of a compact blue clay, containing worn and scratched alpine\r\nboulders and without any trace of stratification. In the gorge of\r\nDranse, near Thoron, M. Morlot found the whole three formations in a\r\ndirect superimposed series. At the bottom was a mass of compact till or\r\nboulder clay, 12 feet thick, containing boulders of alpine limestone.\r\nOver this mass came regularly stratified beds 150 feet thick, made\r\nup of rounded pebbles in horizontal beds. Above this again lay a\r\nsecond formation of unstratified boulder clay, with erratic blocks and\r\nstriated pebbles, which constituted the left lateral moraine of the\r\ngreat glacier of the Rhone, when it advanced for the second time to the\r\nLake of Geneva. A condition of things somewhat similar was observed by\r\nM. Ischer in the neighbourhood of Berne.\r\n\r\nThese facts, M. Morlot justly considers, prove the existence of two\r\nglacial periods separated by an intermediate one, during which the\r\nice, which had not only covered Switzerland, but the greater part of\r\nEurope, disappeared even in the principal valleys of the Alps to a\r\nheight of more than 4,400 feet above the present level of the sea. This\r\nwarm period, after continuing for long ages, was succeeded by a second\r\nglacial period, during which the country was again covered with ice as\r\nbefore. M. Morlot even suggests the possibility of these alternations\r\nof cold and warm periods depending upon a cosmical cause. “Wild as it\r\nmay have appeared,” he says, “when first started, the idea of general\r\nand periodical eras of refrigeration for our planet, connected perhaps\r\nwith some cosmic agency, may eventually prove correct.”[105]\r\n\r\nShortly afterwards, evidence of a far more remarkable character was\r\nfound in the glacial drift of Switzerland, namely, the famous lignite\r\nbeds of Dürnten. In the vicinity of Utznach and Dürnten, on the Lake of\r\nZurich, and near Mörschwyl, on the Lake of Constance, there are beds of\r\ncoal or lignite, nearly 12 feet thick, lying directly on the boulder\r\nclay. Overlying these beds is another mass of drift and clay 30 feet\r\nin thickness, with rounded blocks, and on the top of this upper drift\r\nlie long angular erratics, which evidently have been transported on\r\nthe back of glaciers.[106] Professor Vogt attributes their transport\r\nto floating ice; but he evidently does so to avoid the hypothesis of a\r\nwarm period during the glacial epoch.\r\n\r\nHere we have proof not merely of the disappearance of the ice during\r\nthe glacial epoch, but of its absence during a period of sufficient\r\nlength to allow of the growth of 10 or 12 feet of coal. Professor Heer\r\nthinks that this coal-bed, when in the condition of peat, must have\r\nbeen 60 feet thick; and assuming that one foot of peat would be formed\r\nin a century, he concludes that 6,000 years must have been required\r\nfor the growth of the coal plants. According to Liebig, 9,600 years\r\nwould be required. This, as we have already seen, is about the average\r\nduration of a warm period.\r\n\r\nIn these beds have been found the bones of the elephant (_E. Merkii_),\r\nstag, cave-bear, and other animals. Numerous insects have also been met\r\nwith, which further prove the warm, mild condition of climate which\r\nmust have prevailed at the time of the formation of the lignite.\r\n\r\nAt Hoxne, near Diss, in Suffolk, a black peaty mass several feet thick,\r\ncontaining fragments of wood of the oak, yew, and fir, was found,\r\noverlying the boulder clay.[107] Professor Vogt believes that this peat\r\nbed is of the same age as the lignite beds of Switzerland.\r\n\r\nIn the glacial drift of North America, particularly about Lake\r\nChamplain and the valley of the St. Lawrence, there is similar evidence\r\nof two glacial periods with an intervening non-glacial or warm\r\nperiod.[108]\r\n\r\n_Glacial and Inter-glacial Periods of the Southern Hemisphere_—(_South\r\nAfrica_).—Mr. G. W. Stow, in a paper on the “Geology of South\r\nAfrica,”[109] describes a recent glaciation extending over a large\r\nportion of Natal, British Kaffraria, the Kaga and Krome mountains,\r\nwhich he attributes to the action of land-ice. He sums up the phenomena\r\nas follows:—“The rounding off of the hills in the interiors of the\r\nancient basins; the numerous dome-shaped (_roches moutonnée_) rocks;\r\nthe enormous erratic boulders in positions where water could not have\r\ncarried them; the frequency of unstratified clays—clays with imbedded\r\nangular boulders; drift and lofty mounds of boulders; large tracts of\r\ncountry thickly spread over with unstratified clays and superimposed\r\nfragments of rock; the Oliphant’s-Hoek clay, and the vast piles of Enon\r\nconglomerate.” In addition to these results of ice-action, he records\r\nthe discovery by himself of distinct ice-scratches or groovings on the\r\nsurface of the rocks at Reit-Poort in the Tarka, and subsequently[110]\r\nthe discovery by Mr. G. Gilfillan of a large boulder at Pniel with\r\n_striæ_ distinctly marked upon it, and also that the same observer\r\nfound that almost every boulder in the gravel at “Moonlight Rush” had\r\nunmistakable striæ on one or more sides.\r\n\r\nIn South Africa there is evidence not only of a glacial condition\r\nduring the Pliocene period, but also of a warmer climate than now\r\nprevails in that region. “The evidence,” says Mr. Stow, “of the\r\nPliocene shells of the superficial limestone of the Zwartkops heights,\r\nand elsewhere, leads us to believe that the climate of South Africa\r\nmust have been of a far more tropical character than at present.\r\n\r\n“Take, for instance, the characteristic _Venericardia_ of that\r\nlimestone. This has migrated along the coast some 29° or 30° and is now\r\nfound within a few degrees of the equator, near Zanzibar, gradually\r\ndriven, as I presume it must have been, further and further north by a\r\ngradual lowering of the temperature of the more southern parts of this\r\ncoast since the limestone was deposited.”\r\n\r\n“During the formation of the shell-banks in the Zwartkops estuary,\r\nyounger than the Pliocene limestone, the immense number of certain\r\nspecies of shells, which have as yet been found living only in\r\nlatitudes nearer the equator, point to a somewhat similar though a more\r\nmodified change of temperature.”\r\n\r\n_Inter-glacial Beds of Scotland._—Upwards of a dozen years ago,\r\nProfessor Geikie arrived, from his own observations of the glacial\r\ndrift of Scotland, at a similar conclusion to that of M. Morlot\r\nregarding the intercalation of warm periods during the glacial epoch;\r\nand the facts on which Professor Geikie’s conclusions were based are\r\nbriefly as follows. In a cliff of boulder clay on the banks of the\r\nSlitrig Water, near the town of Hawick, he observed a bed of stones\r\nor shingle. Over the lower stratum of stones lay a few inches of\r\nwell-stratified sand, silt, and clay, some of the layers being black\r\nand peaty, _with enclosed vegetable fibres_ in a crumbling state.[111]\r\nThere were some 30 or 40 feet of boulder clay above these stratified\r\nbeds, and 15 or 20 feet under them. The stones in the shingle band\r\nwere identical with those of the boulder clay, but they showed no\r\nstriations, and were more rounded and water-worn, and resembled in\r\nevery respect the stones now lying in the bed of the Slitrig. The\r\nsection of the cliff stood as under:—\r\n\r\n                    1. Vegetable soil.\r\n                    2. Boulder clay, thirty to forty feet.\r\n                  { 3. Yellowish gravelly sand.\r\n  Stratified beds { 4. Peaty silt and clay.\r\n                  { 5. Fine ferruginous sand.\r\n                  { 6. Coarse shingle, two to three feet.\r\n                    7. Coarse, stiff boulder clay, fifteen to twenty feet.\r\n\r\nA few more cases of intercalation of stratified materials in the true\r\ntill were also found in the same valley.\r\n\r\nIn a cliff of stiff brown boulder clay, about 20 feet high, on the\r\nbanks of the Carmichael Water, Lanarkshire, Professor Geikie observed\r\na stratified bed of clay about 3 or 4 inches in thickness. About a mile\r\nhigher up the stream, he found a series of beds of gravel, sand, and\r\nclay in the true _till_. “A thin seam of _peaty matter_,” he says, “was\r\nobserved to run for a few inches along the bottom of a bed of clay and\r\nthen disappear, while in a band of fine laminated clay with thin sandy\r\npartings occasional _fragments of mouldering wood_ were found.”[112]\r\n\r\nAt Chapelhall, near Airdrie, a sand-bed has been extensively mined\r\nunder about 114 feet of till. This bed of finely stratified sand\r\nis about 20 feet thick. In it were found lenticular beds of fine\r\npale-coloured clay containing layers of peat and decaying twigs and\r\nbranches. Professor Geikie found the vegetable fibres, though much\r\ndecayed, still distinct, and the substance when put into the fire\r\nburned with a dull lambent flame. Underlying these stratified beds, and\r\nforming the floor of the mine, is a deposit of _the true till_ about\r\n24 feet in thickness. In another pit adjoining, the till forming the\r\nfloor is 30 feet thick, but it is sometimes absent altogether, so as to\r\nleave the sand beds resting directly on the sandstone and shale of the\r\ncoal-measures. At some distance from this sand-pit an old buried river\r\nchannel was met with in one of the pit workings. This channel was found\r\nto contain a coating of boulder clay, on which the laminated sands and\r\nclays reposed, showing, as Professor Geikie has pointed out, that this\r\nold channel had been filled with boulder clay, and then re-excavated\r\nto allow of the deposition of the stratified deposits. Over all lay a\r\nthick mantle of boulder clay which buried the whole.\r\n\r\nA case somewhat similar was found by Professor Nicol in a cutting on\r\nthe Edinburgh and Leith Railway. In many places the till had been\r\nworn into hollows as if part of it had been removed by the action of\r\nrunning water.[113] One of these hollows, about 5 or 6 feet wide by 3\r\nor 4 feet deep, closely resembled the channel of a small stream. It\r\nwas also filled with gravel and sand, in all respects like that found\r\nin such a stream at the present day. It was seen to exhibit the same\r\ncharacters on both sides of the cutting, but Professor Nicol was unable\r\nto determine how far it may have extended beyond; but he had no doubt\r\nwhatever that it had been formed by a stream of water. Over this old\r\nwatercourse was a thick deposit of true till.\r\n\r\nIn reference to the foregoing cases, Professor Geikie makes the\r\nfollowing pertinent remarks:—“Here it is evident that the scooping out\r\nof this channel belongs to the era of the boulder clay. It must have\r\nbeen effected during a pause in the deposition of the clay, when a run\r\nof water could find its way along the inequalities of the surface of\r\nthe clay. This pause must have been of sufficient duration to enable\r\nthe runnel to excavate a capacious channel for itself, and leave in it\r\na quantity of sand and shingle. We can scarcely doubt that when this\r\nprocess was going on the ground must have been a land surface, and\r\ncould not have been under the sea. And lastly, we see from the upper\r\nboulder clay that the old conditions returned, the watercourse was\r\nchoked up, and another mass of chaotic boulder clay was tumbled down\r\nupon the face of the country. This indicates that the boulder clay is\r\nnot the result of one great catastrophe, but of slow and silent, yet\r\nmighty, forces acting sometimes with long pauses throughout a vast\r\ncycle of time.”[114]\r\n\r\nAt Craiglockhart Hill, about a mile south of Edinburgh, an extensive\r\nbed of fine sand of from one to three feet in thickness was found\r\nbetween two distinct masses of true boulder clay or till. The sand was\r\nextensively used for building purposes during the erection of the city\r\npoorhouse a few years ago. In this sand-bed I found a great many tree\r\nroots in the position in which they had grown. During the time of the\r\nexcavations I visited the place almost daily, and had every opportunity\r\nof satisfying myself that this sand-bed, prior to the time of the\r\nformation of the upper boulder clay, must have been a land surface\r\non which the roots had grown. In no case did I find them penetrating\r\ninto the upper boulder clay, and in several places I found stones of\r\nthe upper clay resting directly on the broken ends of the roots. These\r\nroots were examined by Professor Balfour, but they were so decayed that\r\nhe was unable to determine their character.\r\n\r\nIn digging a foundation for a building in Leith Walk, Edinburgh, a few\r\nyears ago, two distinct beds of sand were passed through, the upper,\r\nabout 10 feet in thickness, rested upon what appeared to be a denuded\r\nsurface of the lower bed. In this lower bed, which evidently had been\r\na land surface, numbers of tree roots were found. I had the pleasure\r\nof examining them along with my friend Mr. C. W. Peach, who first\r\ndirected my attention to them. In no instance were the roots found\r\nin the upper bed. That these roots did not belong to trees which had\r\ngrown on the present surface and penetrated to that depth, was further\r\nevident from the fact that in one or two cases we found the roots\r\nbroken off at the place where they had been joined to the trunk, and\r\nthere the upper sand-bed over them was more than 10 feet in thickness.\r\nIf we assume that the roots belonged to trees which had grown on the\r\npresent surface, then we must also assume, what no one would be willing\r\nto admit, that the trunks of the trees had grown downwards into the\r\nearth to a depth of upwards of ten feet. I have shown these roots to\r\nseveral botanists, but none of them could determine to what trees they\r\nbelonged. The surface of the ground at the spot in question is 45 feet\r\nabove sea-level. Mr. Peach and I have found similar roots in the under\r\nsand-bed at several other places in the same neighbourhood. That they\r\nbelong to an inter-glacial period appears probable for the following\r\nreasons:—(1.) This upper sand-bed is overlaid by a tough clay, which\r\nin all respects appears to be the same as the Portobello clay, which\r\nwe know belongs to the glacial series. In company with Mr. Bennie,\r\nI found the clay in some places to be contorted in a similar manner\r\nto the Portobello clays. (2.) In a sand-pit about one or two hundred\r\nyards to the west of where the roots were found, the sand-bed was\r\nfound contorted in the most extraordinary manner to a depth of about 15\r\nfeet. In fact, for a space of more than 30 feet, the bedding had been\r\ncompletely turned up on end without the fine layers being in the least\r\ndegree broken or disarranged, showing that they had been upturned by\r\nsome enormous powers acting on a large mass of the sand.\r\n\r\nOne of the best examples of true till to be met with in the\r\nneighbourhood of Edinburgh is at Redhall Quarry, about three miles to\r\nthe south-west of the city. In recently opening up a new quarry near\r\nthe old one a bed of peat was found intercalated in the thick mass of\r\ntill overlying the rock. The clay overlying and underlying the peat-bed\r\nwas carefully examined by Mr. John Henderson,[115] and found to be true\r\ntill.\r\n\r\nIn a quarry at Overtown, near Beith, Ayrshire, a sedimentary bed of\r\nclay, intercalated between two boulder clays, was some years ago\r\nobserved by Mr. Robert Craig, of the Glasgow Geological Society. This\r\nbed filled an elliptical basin about 130 yards long, and about 30 yards\r\nbroad. Its thickness averaged from one to two feet. This sedimentary\r\nbed rested on the till on the north-east end of the basin, and was\r\nitself overlaid on the south-west end by the upper bed of till. The\r\nclay bed was found to be full of roots and stems of the common hazel.\r\nThat these roots had grown in the position in which they were found\r\nwas evident from the fact that they were in many places found to pass\r\ninto the “cutters” or fissures of the limestone, and were here found\r\nin a flattened form, having in growing accommodated themselves to the\r\nsize and shape of the fissures. Nuts of the hazel were plentifully\r\nfound.[116]\r\n\r\nAt Hillhead, some distance from Overtown, there is a similar\r\nintercalated bed full of hazel remains, and a species of freshwater\r\n_Ostracoda_ was detected by Mr. David Robertson.\r\n\r\nIn a railway cutting a short distance from Beith, Mr. Craig pointed out\r\nto my colleague, Mr. Jack, and myself, a thin layer of peaty matter,\r\nextending for a considerable distance between an upper and lower mass\r\nof till; and at one place we found a piece of oak about four feet in\r\nlength and about seven or eight inches in thickness. This oak boulder\r\nwas well polished and striated.\r\n\r\nNot far from this place is the famous Crofthead inter-glacial bed, so\r\nwell known from the description given by Mr. James Geikie and others\r\nthat I need not here describe it. I had the pleasure of visiting the\r\nsection twice while it was well exposed, once, in company with Mr.\r\nJames Geikie, and I do not entertain the shadow of a doubt as to its\r\ntrue inter-glacial character.\r\n\r\nIn the silt, evidently the mud of an inter-glacial lake, were found the\r\nupper portion of the skull of the great extinct ox (_Bos primigenius_),\r\nhorns of the Irish elk or deer, and bones of the horse. In the detailed\r\nlist of the lesser organic remains found in the intercalated peat-bed\r\nby Mr. J. A. Mahony,[117] are the following, viz., three species of\r\n_Desmidaceæ_, thirty-one species of _Diatomaceæ_, eleven species of\r\nmosses, nine species of phanerogamous plants, and several species of\r\nannelids, crustacea, and insects. This list clearly shows that the\r\ninter-glacial period, represented by these remains, was not only mild\r\nand warm, but of considerable duration. Mr. David Robertson found in\r\nthe clay under the peat several species of _Ostracoda_.\r\n\r\nThe well-known Kilmaurs bed of peaty matter in which the remains of\r\nthe mammoth and reindeer were found, has now by the researches of the\r\nGeological Survey been proved to be of inter-glacial age.[118]\r\n\r\nIn Ireland, as shown by Professors Hull and Harkness, the inter-glacial\r\nbeds, called by them the “manure gravels,” contain numerous fragments\r\nof shells indicating a more genial climate than prevailed when the\r\nboulder clays lying above and below them were formed.[119]\r\n\r\nIn Sweden inter-glacial beds of freshwater origin, containing plants,\r\nhave been met with by Herr Nathorst and also by Herr Holmström.[120]\r\n\r\nIn North America Mr. Whittlesey describes inter-glacial beds of blue\r\nclay enclosing pieces of wood, intercalated with beds of hard pan\r\n(till). Professor Newberry found at Germantown, Ohio, an immense bed of\r\npeat, from 12 to 20 feet in thickness, underlying, in some places 30\r\nfeet, and in other places as much as 80 feet, of till, and overlying\r\ndrift beds. The uppermost layers of the peat contain undecomposed\r\nsphagnous mosses, grasses, and sedges, but in the other portions of\r\nthe bed abundant fragments of coniferous wood, identified as red cedar\r\n(_Juniperus virginiana_), have been found. Ash, hickory, sycamore,\r\ntogether with grape-vines and beech-leaves, were also met with, and\r\nwith these the remains of the mastodon and great extinct beaver.[121]\r\n\r\n_Inter-glacial Beds of England._—Scotland has been so much denuded by\r\nthe ice sheet with which it was covered during the period of maximum\r\nglaciation that little can be learned in this part of the island\r\nregarding the early history of the glacial epoch. But in England,\r\nand more especially in the south-eastern portion of it, matters are\r\nsomewhat different. We have, in the Norwich Crag and Chillesford beds,\r\na formation pretty well developed, which is now generally regarded as\r\nlying at the base of the Glacial Series. That this formation is of a\r\nglacial character is evident from the fact of its containing shells of\r\na northern type, such as _Leda lanceolata_, _Cardium Groènlandicum_,\r\n_Lucina borealis_, _Cyprina Islandica_, _Panopæa Norvegica_, and\r\n_Mya truncata_. But the glacial character of the formation is\r\nmore strikingly brought out, as Sir Charles Lyell remarks, by the\r\npredominance of such species as _Rhynchonella psittacea_, _Tellina\r\ncalcarea_, _Astarte borealis_, _Scalaria Groènlandica_, and _Fusus\r\ncarinatus_.\r\n\r\n_The “Forest Beds.”_—Immediately following this in the order of\r\ntime comes the famous “Forest Bed” of Cromer. This buried forest has\r\nbeen traced for more than forty miles along the coast from Cromer to\r\nnear Kessengland, and consists of stumps of trees standing erect,\r\nattached to their roots, penetrating the original soil in which they\r\ngrew. Here and in the overlying fluvio-marine beds we have the first\r\nevidence of at least a temperate, if not a warm, inter-glacial period.\r\nThis is evident from the character of the flora and fauna belonging\r\nto these beds. Among the trees we have, for example, the Scotch and\r\nspruce fir, the yew, the oak, birch, the alder, and the common sloe.\r\nThere have also been found the white and yellow water-lilies, the\r\npond-weed, and others. Amongst the mammalia have been met with the\r\n_Elephas meridionalis_, also found in the Lower Pliocene beds of the\r\nVal d’Arno, near Florence; _Elephas antiquus_, _Hippopotamus major_,\r\n_Rhinoceros Etruscus_, the two latter Val d’Arno species, the roebuck,\r\nthe horse, the stag, the Irish elk, the _Cervus Polignacus_, found\r\nalso at Mont Perrier, France, _C. verticornis_, and _C. carnutorum_,\r\nthe latter also found in Pliocene strata of St. Prest, France. In\r\nthe fluvio-marine series have been found the _Cyclas omnica_ and the\r\n_Paludina marginata_, a species of mollusc still found in the South of\r\nFrance, but no longer inhabiting the British Isles.\r\n\r\nAbove the forest bed and fluvio-marine series comes the well-known\r\nunstratified Norwich boulder till, containing immense blocks 6 or 8\r\nfeet in diameter, many of which must have come from Scandinavia, and\r\nabove the unstratified till are a series of contorted beds of sand and\r\ngravel. This series may be considered to represent a period of intense\r\nglaciation. Above this again comes the middle drift of Mr. Searles\r\nWood, junior, yielding shells which indicate, as is now generally\r\nadmitted, a comparatively mild condition of climate. Upon this middle\r\ndrift lies the upper boulder clay, which is well developed in South\r\nNorfolk and Suffolk, and which is of unmistakable glacial origin. Newer\r\nthan all these are the Mundesley freshwater beds, which lie in a hollow\r\ndenuded out of the foregoing series. In this formation a black peaty\r\ndeposit containing seeds of plants, insects, shells, and scales and\r\nbones of fishes, has been found, all indicating a mild and temperate\r\ncondition of climate. Among the shells there is, as in the forest bed,\r\nthe _Paludina marginata_. And that an arctic condition of things in\r\nEngland followed is believed by Mr. Fisher and others, on the evidence\r\nof the “Trail” described by the former observer.\r\n\r\n_Cave and River Deposits._—Evidence of the existence of warm periods\r\nduring the glacial epoch is derived from a class of facts which\r\nhave long been regarded by geologists as very puzzling, namely, the\r\noccurrence of mollusca and mammalia of a southern type associated\r\nin England and on the continent with those of an extremely arctic\r\ncharacter. For example, _Cyrena fluminalis_ is a shell which does not\r\nlive at present in any European river, but inhabits the Nile and parts\r\nof Asia, especially Cashmere. _Unio littoralis_, extinct in Britain,\r\nis still abundant in the Loire; _Paludina marginata_ does not exist\r\nin this country. These shells of a southern type have been found in\r\npost-tertiary deposits at Gray’s Thurrock, in Essex; in the valley\r\nof the Ouse, near Bedford; and at Hoxne, in Suffolk, associated with\r\na _Hippopotamus_ closely allied to that now inhabiting the Nile, and\r\n_Elephas antiquus_, an animal remarkable for its southern range.\r\nAmongst other forms of a southern type which have been met with in\r\nthe cave and river deposits, are the spotted hyæna from Africa,\r\nan animal, says Mr. Dawkins, identical, except in size, with the\r\ncave hyæna, the African elephant (_E. Africanus_), and the _Elephas\r\nmeridionalis_, the great beaver (_Trogontherium_), the cave hyæna\r\n(_Hyæna spelæa_), the cave lion (_Felis leo_, var. _spelæa_), the lynx\r\n(_Felis lynx_), the sabre-toothed tiger (_Machairodus latidens_), the\r\nrhinoceros (_Rhinoceros megarhinus_ and _R. leptorhinus_). But the\r\nmost extraordinary thing is that along with these, associated in the\r\nsame beds, have been found the remains of such animals of an arctic\r\ntype as the glutton (_Gulo luscus_), the ermine (_Mustela erminea_),\r\nthe reindeer (_Cervus tarandus_), the musk-ox or musk-sheep (_Ovibos\r\nmoschatus_), the aurochs (_Bison priscus_), the woolly rhinoceros\r\n(_Rhinoceros tichorhinus_), the mammoth (_Elephas primigenius_), and\r\nothers of a like character. According to Mr. Boyd Dawkins, these\r\nsouthern animals extended as far north as Yorkshire in England, and\r\nthe northern animals as far south as the latitude of the Alps and\r\nPyrenees.[122]\r\n\r\n_The Explanation of the Difficulty._—As an explanation of these\r\npuzzling phenomena, I suggested, in the Philosophical Magazine for\r\nNovember, 1868, that these southern animals lived in our island during\r\nthe warm periods of the glacial epoch, while the northern animals\r\nlived during the cold periods. This view I am happy to find has lately\r\nbeen supported by Sir John Lubbock; further, Mr. James Geikie, in his\r\n“Great Ice Age,” and also in the Geological Magazine, has entered so\r\nfully into the subject and brought forward such a body of evidence\r\nin support of it, that, in all probability, it will, ere long, be\r\ngenerally accepted. The only objection which has been advanced, so far\r\nas I am aware, deserving of serious consideration, is that by Mr. Boyd\r\nDawkins, who holds that if these migrations had been _secular_ instead\r\nof seasonal, as is supposed by Sir Charles Lyell and himself, the\r\narctic and southern animals would now be found in separate deposits.\r\nIt is perfectly true that if there had been only one cold and one warm\r\nperiod, each of geologically immense duration, the remains might, of\r\ncourse, be expected to have been found in separate beds; but when\r\nwe consider that the glacial epoch consisted of a long _succession\r\nof alternate cold and warm periods_, of not more than ten or twelve\r\nthousand years each, we can hardly expect that in the river deposits\r\nbelonging to this long cycle we should be able to distinguish the\r\ndeposits of the cold periods from those of the warm.\r\n\r\n_Shell Beds._—Evidence of warm inter-glacial periods may be justly\r\ninferred from the presence of shells of a southern type which have been\r\nfound in glacial beds, of which some illustrations follow.\r\n\r\nIn the southern parts of Norway, from the present sea-level up to 500\r\nfeet, are found glacial shell beds, similar to those of Scotland. In\r\nthese beds _Trochus magus_, _Tapes decussata_, and _Pholas candida_\r\nhave been found, shells which are distributed between the Mediterranean\r\nand the shores of England, but no longer live round the coasts of\r\nNorway.\r\n\r\nAt Capellbacken, near Udevalla, in Sweden, there is an extensive bed of\r\nshells 20 to 30 feet in thickness. This formation has been described\r\nby Mr. Gwyn Jeffreys.[123] It consists of several distinct layers,\r\napparently representing many epochs and conditions. Its shells are of a\r\nhighly arctic character, and several of the species have not been found\r\nliving south of the arctic circle. But the remarkable circumstance\r\nis that it contains _Cypræa lurida_, a Mediterranean shell, which\r\nMr. Jeffreys, after some hesitation, believed to belong to the bed.\r\nAgain, at Lilleherstehagen, a short distance from Capellbacken,\r\nanother extensive deposit is exposed. “Here the upper layer,” says Mr.\r\nJeffreys, “gives a singular result. Mixed with the universal _Trophon\r\nclathratus_ (which is a high northern species, and found living only\r\nwithin the arctic circle) are many shells of a southern type, such are\r\n_Ostrea edulis_, _Tapes pullastra_, _Corbula gibba_, and _Aporrhais\r\npes-pelicani_.”\r\n\r\nAt Kempsey, near Worcester, a shell bed is described by Sir R.\r\nMurchison in his “Silurian System” (p. 533), in which _Bulla ampulla_\r\nand a species of _Oliva_, shells of a southern type, have been found.\r\n\r\nA case somewhat similar to the above is recorded by the Rev. Mr.\r\nCrosskey as having been met with in Scotland at the Kyles of Bute.\r\n“Among the Clyde beds, I have found,” he says, “a layer containing\r\nshells, in which those of a more southern type appear to exist in\r\ngreater profusion and perfection than even in our present seas. It is\r\nan open question,” he continues, “whether our climate was not slightly\r\nwarmer than it is now between the glacial epoch and the present\r\nday.”[124]\r\n\r\nIn a glacial bed near Greenock, Mr. A. Bell found the fry of living\r\nMediterranean forms, viz., _Conus Mediterraneus_ and _Cardita trapezia_.\r\n\r\nAlthough deposits containing shells of a temperate or of a southern\r\ntype in glacial beds have not been often recorded, it by no means\r\nfollows that such deposits are actually of rare occurrence. That\r\nglacial beds should contain deposits indicating a temperate or a\r\nwarm condition of climate is a thing so contrary to all preconceived\r\nopinions regarding the sequence of events during the glacial epoch,\r\nthat most geologists, were they to meet with a shell of a southern\r\ntype in one of those beds, would instantly come to the conclusion that\r\nits occurrence there was purely accidental, and would pay no special\r\nattention to the matter.\r\n\r\n_Evidence derived from “Borings.”_—With the view of ascertaining if\r\nadditional light would be cast on the sequence of events, during the\r\nformation of the boulder clay, by an examination of the journals of\r\nbores made through a great depth of surface deposits, I collected,\r\nduring the summer of 1867, about two hundred and fifty such records,\r\nput down in all parts of the mining districts of Scotland. An\r\nexamination of these bores shows most conclusively that the opinion\r\nthat the boulder clay, or lower till, is one great undivided formation,\r\nis wholly erroneous.\r\n\r\nThese two hundred and fifty bores represent a total thickness of 21,348\r\nfeet, giving 86 feet as the mean thickness of the deposits passed\r\nthrough. Twenty of these have one boulder clay, with beds of stratified\r\nsand or gravel beneath the clay; twenty-five have _two_ boulder clays,\r\nwith stratified beds of sand and gravel between; ten have _three_\r\nboulder clays; one has _four_ boulder clays; two have _five_ boulder\r\nclays; and no one has fewer than _six_ separate masses of boulder\r\nclay, with stratified beds of sand and gravel between; sixteen have\r\ntwo or three separate boulder clays, differing altogether in colour\r\nand hardness, without any stratified beds between. We have, therefore,\r\nout of two hundred and fifty bores, seventy-five of them representing\r\na condition of things wholly different from that exhibited to the\r\ngeologist in ordinary sections.\r\n\r\nThe full details of the character of the deposits passed through by\r\nthese bores, and their bearing on the history of the glacial epoch,\r\nhave been given by Mr. James Bennie, in an interesting paper read\r\nbefore the Glasgow Geological Society,[125] to which I would refer all\r\nthose interested in the subject of surface geology.\r\n\r\nThe evidence afforded by these bores of the existence of warm\r\ninter-glacial periods will, however, fall to be considered in a\r\nsubsequent chapter.[126]\r\n\r\nAnother important and unexpected result obtained from these bores to\r\nwhich we shall have occasion to refer, was the evidence which they\r\nafforded of a Continental Period.\r\n\r\n_Striated Pavements._—It has been sometimes observed that in horizontal\r\nsections of the boulder clay, the stones and boulders are all striated\r\nin one uniform direction, and this has been effected over the original\r\nmarkings on the boulders. It has been inferred from this that a pause\r\nof long duration must have taken place in the formation of the boulder\r\nclay, during which the ice disappeared and the clay became hardened\r\ninto a solid mass. After which the old condition of things returned,\r\nglaciers again appeared, passed over the surface of the hardened clay\r\nwith its imbedded boulders, and ground it down in the same way as they\r\nhad formerly done the solid rocks underneath the clay.\r\n\r\nAn instance of striated pavements in the boulder clay was observed by\r\nMr. Robert Chambers in a cliff between Portobello and Fisherrow. At\r\nseveral places a narrow train of blocks was observed crossing the line\r\nof the beach, somewhat like a quay or mole, but not more than a foot\r\nabove the general level. All the blocks _had flat sides uppermost,\r\nand all the flat sides were striated in the same direction_ as that\r\nof the rocky surface throughout the country. A similar instance was\r\nalso observed between Leith and Portobello. “There is, in short,” says\r\nMr. Chambers, “a surface of the boulder clay, deep down in the entire\r\nbed, which, to appearance, has been in precisely the same circumstances\r\nas the fast rock surface below had previously been. It has had in its\r\nturn to sustain the weight and abrading force of the glacial agent,\r\nin whatever form it was applied; and the additional deposits of the\r\nboulder clay left over this surface may be presumed to have been formed\r\nby the agent on that occasion.”[127]\r\n\r\nSeveral cases of a similar character were observed by Mr. James\r\nSmith, of Jordanhill, on the beach at Row, and on the shore of the\r\nGareloch.[128] Between Dunbar and Cockburnspath, Professor Geikie found\r\nalong the beach, for a space of 30 or 40 square yards, numbers of large\r\nblocks of limestone with flattened upper sides, imbedded in a stiff red\r\nclay, and all striated in one direction. On the shores of the Solway he\r\nfound another example.[129]\r\n\r\nThe cases of striated pavements recorded are, however, not very\r\nnumerous. But this by no means shows that they are of rare occurrence\r\nin the boulder clay. These pavements, of course, are to be found only\r\nin the interior of the mass, and even there they can only be seen\r\nalong a horizontal section. But sections of this kind are rarely to be\r\nmet with, for river channels, quarries, railway cuttings, and other\r\nexcavations of a similar character which usually lay open the boulder\r\nclay, exhibit vertical sections only. It is therefore only along the\r\nsea-shore, as Professor Geikie remarks, where the surface of the clay\r\nhas been worn away by the action of the waves, that opportunities have\r\nhitherto been presented to the geologist for observing them.\r\n\r\nThere can be little doubt that during the warm periods of the glacial\r\nepoch our island would be clothed with a luxuriant flora. At the end\r\nof a cold period, when the ice had disappeared, the whole face of the\r\ncountry would be covered over to a considerable depth with a confused\r\nmass of stones and boulder clay. A surface thus wholly destitute of\r\nevery seed and germ would probably remain for years without vegetation.\r\nBut through course of time life would begin to appear, and during\r\nthe thousands of years of perpetual summer which would follow, the\r\nsoil, uncongenial as it no doubt must have been, would be forced to\r\nsustain a luxuriant vegetation. But although this was the case, we\r\nneed not wonder that now scarcely a single vestige of it remains; for\r\nwhen the ice sheet again crept over the island everything animate and\r\ninanimate would be ground down to powder. We are certain that prior\r\nto the glacial epoch our island must have been covered with life and\r\nvegetation. But not a single vestige of these are now to be found;\r\nno, not even of the very soil on which the vegetation grew. The solid\r\nrock itself upon which the soil lay has been ground down to mud by the\r\nice sheet, and, to a large extent, as Professor Geikie remarks, swept\r\naway into the adjoining seas.[130] It is now even more difficult to\r\nfind a trace of the ancient soil _under_ the boulder clay than it is\r\nto find remains of the soil of the warm periods _in_ that clay. As\r\nregards Scotland, cases of old land surfaces under the boulder clay are\r\nas seldom recorded as cases of old land surfaces in it. In so far as\r\ngeology is concerned, there is as much evidence to show that our island\r\nwas clothed with vegetation during the glacial epoch as there is that\r\nit was so clothed prior to that epoch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n             WARM INTER-GLACIAL PERIODS IN ARCTIC REGIONS.\r\n\r\n  Cold Periods best marked in Temperate, and Warm Periods\r\n      in Arctic, Regions.—State of Arctic Regions during\r\n      Glacial Period.—Effects of Removal of Ice from Arctic\r\n      Regions.—Ocean-Currents; Influence on Arctic Climate.—Reason\r\n      why Remains of Inter-glacial Period are rare in Arctic\r\n      Regions.—Remains of Ancient Forests in Banks’s Land, Prince\r\n      Patrick’s Island, &c.—Opinions of Sir R. Murchison, Captain\r\n      Osborn, and Professor Haughton.—Tree dug up by Sir E. Belcher\r\n      in lat. 75° N.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the temperate regions the cold periods of the glacial epoch would be\r\nfar more marked than the warm inter-glacial periods. The condition of\r\nthings which prevailed during the cold periods would differ far more\r\nwidely from that which now prevails than would the condition of things\r\nduring the warm periods. But as regards the polar regions the reverse\r\nwould be the case; there the warm inter-glacial periods would be far\r\nmore marked than the cold periods. The condition of things prevailing\r\nin those regions during the warm periods would be in strongest contrast\r\nto what now obtains, but this would not hold true in reference to the\r\ncold periods; for during the latter, matters there would be pretty\r\nmuch the same as at present, only a good deal more severe. The reason\r\nof this may be seen from what has already been stated in Chapter IV.;\r\nbut as it is a point of considerable importance in order to a proper\r\nunderstanding of the physical state of things prevailing in polar\r\nregions during the glacial epoch, I shall consider this part of the\r\nsubject more fully.\r\n\r\nDuring the cold periods, our island, and nearly all places in the\r\nnorthern temperate regions down to about the same latitude, would be\r\ncovered with snow and ice, and all animal and vegetable life within\r\nthe glaciated area would to a great extent be destroyed. The presence\r\nof the ice would of itself, for reasons already explained, lower the\r\nmean annual temperature to near the freezing-point. The summers,\r\nnotwithstanding the proximity of the sun, would not be warm, on the\r\ncontrary their temperature would rise little above the freezing-point.\r\nAn excess of evaporation would no doubt take place, owing to the\r\nincrease in the intensity of the sun’s rays, but this result would only\r\ntend to increase the snowfall.[131]\r\n\r\nDuring the warm periods our country and the regions under consideration\r\nwould experience conditions not differing much from those of the\r\npresent, but the climate would probably be somewhat warmer and more\r\nequable. The proximity of the sun during winter would prevent snow\r\nfrom falling. The summers, owing to the greater distance of the sun,\r\nwould probably be somewhat colder than they are now. But the loss of\r\nheat during summer would be to a large extent compensated for by two\r\ncauses to which we must here refer. (1.) The much greater amount of\r\nheat conveyed by ocean-currents than at present. (2.) Our summers are\r\nnow cooled to a considerable extent by cold aërial currents from the\r\nice-covered regions of the north. But during the period in question\r\nthere would be little or no ice in arctic regions, consequently the\r\nwinds would be comparatively warm, whatever direction they came from.\r\n\r\nLet us next direct our attention to the state of things in the arctic\r\nregions during the glacial epoch. At present Greenland and other parts\r\nof the arctic regions occupied by land are almost wholly covered\r\nwith ice, and as a consequence nearly destitute of vegetable life.\r\nDuring the cold periods of the glacial epoch the quantity of snow\r\nfalling would doubtless be greater and the ice thicker, but as regards\r\norganic life, matters would not probably be much worse than they are\r\nat present. In fact, so far as Greenland and the antarctic continent\r\nare concerned, they are about as destitute of plant life as they can\r\nbe. Although an increase in the thickness of the arctic ice would not\r\ngreatly alter the present state of matters in those regions, yet what\r\na transformation would ensue upon the disappearance of the ice! This\r\nwould not only raise the summer temperature some twenty degrees or so,\r\nbut would afford the necessary conditions for the existence of abundant\r\nanimal and plant life. The severity of the climate of Greenland is\r\ndue to a very considerable extent, as we have already seen, to the\r\npresence of ice. Get rid of the permanent ice, and the temperature of\r\nthe country, _cæteris paribus_, would instantly rise. That Greenland\r\nshould ever have enjoyed a temperate climate, capable of supporting\r\nabundant vegetation, has often been matter of astonishment, but this\r\nwonder diminishes when we reflect that during the warm periods it would\r\nbe in the arctic regions that the greatest heating effect would take\r\nplace, this being due mainly to the transference of nearly all the warm\r\ninter-tropical waters to one hemisphere.\r\n\r\nIt has been shown in Chapter II. that the heating effects at present\r\nresulting from the transference of heat by ocean-currents increase as\r\nwe approach the poles. As a consequence of this it follows that during\r\nthe warm periods, when the quantity of warm water transferred would be\r\nnearly doubled, the _increase of heat resulting from this cause would\r\nitself increase_ as the warm pole was approached. This effect, combined\r\nwith the shortness of the winter in perihelion and the nearness of the\r\nsun during that season, would prevent the accumulation of snow. During\r\nsummer, the sun, it is true, would be at a much greater distance from\r\nthe earth than at present, but it must be borne in mind that for a\r\nperiod of three months the quantity of heat received from the sun at\r\nthe north pole would be greater than that received at the equator.\r\nConsequently, after the winter’s snow was melted, this great amount of\r\nheat would go to raise the temperature, and the arctic summer could\r\nnot be otherwise than hot. It is not hot at present, but this, be it\r\nobserved, is because of the presence of the ice. When we take all these\r\nfacts into consideration we need not be surprised that Greenland once\r\nenjoyed a condition of climate totally different from that which now\r\nobtains in that region.\r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, in the arctic and antarctic regions where we ought\r\nto find the most marked and decided evidence of warm inter-glacial\r\nperiods. And doubtless such evidence would be abundantly forthcoming\r\nhad these regions not been subjected to such intense denudation since\r\nthe glacial epoch, and were so large a portion of the land not still\r\nburied beneath an icy covering, and therefore beyond the geologist’s\r\nreach. Only on islands and such outlying places as are not shrouded in\r\nsnow and ice can we hope to meet with any trace of the warm periods of\r\nthe glacial epoch: and we may now proceed to consider what relics of\r\nthese warm periods have actually been discovered in arctic regions.\r\n\r\n_Evidence of Warm Periods in Arctic Regions._—The fact that stumps,\r\n&c., of full-grown trees have been found in places where at present\r\nnothing is to be met with but fields of snow and ice, and where the\r\nmean annual temperature scarcely rises above the zero of the Fahrenheit\r\nthermometer, is good evidence to show that the climate of the arctic\r\nregions was once much warmer than now. The remains of an ancient forest\r\nwere discovered by Captain McClure, in Banks’s Land, in latitude 74°\r\n48′. He found a great accumulation of trees, from the sea-level to an\r\nelevation of upwards of 300 feet. “I entered a ravine,” says Captain\r\nMcClure, “some miles inland, and found the north side of it, for a\r\ndepth of 40 feet from the surface, composed of one mass of wood similar\r\nto what I had before seen.”[132] In the ravine he observed a tree\r\nprotruding about 8 feet, and 3 feet in circumference. And he further\r\nstates that, “_From the perfect state of the bark_, and the position of\r\nthe trees so far from the sea, there can be but little doubt that they\r\ngrew originally in the country.” A cone of one of these fir-trees was\r\nbrought home, and was found to belong apparently to the genus _Abies_,\r\nresembling _A. (Pinus) alba_.\r\n\r\nIn Prince Patrick’s Island, in latitude 76° 12′ N., longitude 122°\r\nW., near the head of Walker Inlet, and a considerable distance in the\r\ninterior in one of the ravines, a tree protruding about 10 feet from\r\na bank was discovered by Lieutenant Mecham. It proved to be 4 feet\r\nin circumference. In its neighbourhood several others were seen, all\r\nof them similar to some he had found at Cape Manning; each of them\r\nmeasured 4 feet round and 30 feet in length. The carpenter stated that\r\nthe trees resembled larch. Lieutenant Mecham, from their appearance and\r\nposition, concluded that they must have grown in the country.[133]\r\n\r\nTrees under similar conditions were also found by Lieutenant Pim on\r\nPrince Patrick’s Island, and by Captain Parry on Melville Island, all\r\nconsiderably above the present sea-level and at a distance from the\r\nshore. On the coast of New Siberia, Lieutenant Anjou found a cliff of\r\nclay containing stems of trees still capable of being used for fuel.\r\n\r\n“This remarkable phenomenon,” says Captain Osborn, “opens a vast field\r\nfor conjecture, and the imagination becomes bewildered in trying to\r\nrealise that period of the world’s history when the absence of ice and\r\na milder climate allowed forest trees to grow in a region where now the\r\nground-willow and dwarf-birch have to struggle for existence.”\r\n\r\nSir Roderick Murchison came to the conclusion that all those trees\r\nwere drifted to their present position when the islands of the arctic\r\narchipelago were submerged. But it was the difficulty of accounting\r\nfor the growth of trees in such a region which led him to adopt this\r\nhypothesis. His argument is this: “If we imagine,” he says, “that the\r\ntimber found in those latitudes grew on the spot we should be driven\r\nto adopt the anomalous hypothesis that, notwithstanding physical\r\nrelations of land and water similar to those which now prevail, trees\r\nof large size grew on such _terra firma_ within a few degrees of the\r\nnorth pole!—a supposition which I consider to be wholly incompatible\r\nwith the data in our possession, and at variance with the laws of the\r\nisothermal lines.”[134] This reasoning of Sir Roderick’s may be quite\r\ncorrect, on the supposition that changes of climate are due to changes\r\nin the distribution of sea and land, as advocated by Sir Charles Lyell.\r\nBut these difficulties disappear if we adopt the views advocated in\r\nthe foregoing chapters. As Captain Osborn has pointed out, however,\r\nSir Roderick’s hypothesis leaves the real difficulty untouched. “A\r\nvery different climate,” he says, “must then have existed in those\r\nregions to allow driftwood so perfect as to retain its bark to reach\r\nsuch great distances; and perhaps it may be argued that if that sea was\r\nsufficiently clear of ice to allow such timber to drift unscathed to\r\nPrince Patrick’s Land, that that _very absence of a frozen sea would\r\nallow fir-trees to grow in a soil naturally fertile_.”[135]\r\n\r\nAs has been already stated, all who have seen those trees in arctic\r\nregions agree in thinking that they grew _in situ_. And Professor\r\nHaughton, in his excellent account of the arctic archipelago appended\r\nto McClintock’s “Narrative of Arctic Discoveries,” after a careful\r\nexamination of the entire evidence on the subject, is distinctly of\r\nthe same opinion; while the recent researches of Professor Heer put it\r\nbeyond doubt that the drift theory must be abandoned.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly the arctic archipelago was submerged to an extent that\r\ncould have admitted of those trees being floated to their present\r\npositions. This, as we shall see, follows from theory; but submergence,\r\nwithout a warmer condition of climate, would not enable trees to reach\r\nthose regions with their bark entire.\r\n\r\nBut in reality we are not left to theorise on the subject, for we\r\nhave a well-authenticated case of one of those trees being got by\r\nCaptain Belcher standing erect in the position in which it grew. It was\r\nfound immediately to the northward of the narrow strait opening into\r\nWellington Sound, in lat. 75° 32′ N. long. 92° W., and about a mile and\r\na half inland. The tree was dug up out of the frozen ground, and along\r\nwith it a portion of the soil which was immediately in contact with the\r\nroots. The whole was packed in canvas and brought to England. Near to\r\nthe spot several knolls of peat mosses about nine inches in depth were\r\nfound, containing the bones of the lemming in great numbers. The tree\r\nin question was examined by Sir William Hooker, who gave the following\r\nreport concerning it, which bears out strongly the fact of its having\r\ngrown _in situ_.\r\n\r\n“The piece of wood brought by Sir Edward Belcher from the shores of\r\nWellington Channel belongs to a species of pine, probably to the _Pinus\r\n(Abies) alba_, the most northern conifer. The structure of the wood\r\nof the specimen brought home differs remarkably in its anatomical\r\ncharacter from that of any other conifer with which I am acquainted.\r\nEach concentric ring (or annual growth) consists of two zones of\r\ntissue; one, the outer, that towards the circumference, is broader, of\r\na pale colour, and consists of ordinary tubes of fibres of wood, marked\r\nwith discs common to all coniferæ. These discs are usually opposite\r\none another when more than one row of them occur in the direction of\r\nthe length of the fibre; and, what is very unusual, present radiating\r\nlines from the central depression to the circumference. Secondly,\r\nthe inner zone of each annual ring of wood is narrower, of a dark\r\ncolour, and formed of more slender woody fibres, with thicker walls in\r\nproportion to their diameter. These tubes have few or no discs upon\r\nthem, but are covered with spiral striæ, giving the appearance of each\r\ntube being formed of a twisted band. The above characters prevail in\r\nall parts of the wood, but are slightly modified in different rings.\r\nThus the outer zone is broader in some than in others, the disc-bearing\r\nfibres of the outer zone are sometimes faintly marked with spiral\r\nstriæ, and the spirally marked fibres of the inner zone sometimes bear\r\ndiscs. These appearances suggest the annual recurrence of some special\r\ncause that shall thus modify the first and last formed fibres of each\r\nyear’s deposit, so that that first formed may differ in amount as\r\nwell as in kind from that last formed; and the peculiar conditions of\r\nan arctic climate appear to afford an adequate solution. The inner,\r\nor first-formed zone, must be regarded as imperfectly developed,\r\nbeing deposited at a season when the functions of the plant are very\r\nintermittently exercised, and when a few short hours of sunshine are\r\ndaily succeeded by many of extreme cold. As the season advances the\r\nsun’s heat and light are continuous during the greater part of the\r\ntwenty-four hours, and the newly formed wood fibres are hence more\r\nperfectly developed, they are much longer, present no signs of striæ,\r\nbut are studded with discs of a more highly organized structure than\r\nare usual in the natural order to which this tree belongs.”[136]\r\n\r\nAnother circumstance which shows that the tree had grown where it was\r\nfound is the fact that in digging up the roots portions of the leaves\r\nwere obtained. It may also be mentioned that near this place was found\r\nan old river channel cut deeply into the rock, which, at some remote\r\nperiod, when the climate must have been less rigorous than at present,\r\nhad been occupied by a river of considerable size.\r\n\r\nNow, it is evident that if a tree could have grown at Wellington Sound,\r\nthere is no reason why one might not have grown at Banks’s Land, or\r\nat Prince Patrick’s Island. And, if the climatic condition of the\r\ncountry would allow one tree to grow, it would equally as well allow\r\na hundred, a thousand, or a whole forest. If this, then, be the case,\r\nSir Roderick’s objection to the theory of growth _in situ_ falls to the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nAnother circumstance which favours the idea that those trees grew\r\nduring the glacial epoch is the fact that although they are recent,\r\ngeologically speaking, and belong to the drift series, yet they are,\r\nhistorically speaking, very old. The wood, though not fossilized, is so\r\nhardened and changed by age that it will scarcely burn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n         FORMER GLACIAL EPOCHS.—REASON OF THE IMPERFECTION OF\r\n               GEOLOGICAL RECORDS IN REFERENCE TO THEM.\r\n\r\n  Two Reasons why so little is known of Glacial Epochs.—Evidence\r\n      of Glaciation to be found on Land-surfaces.—Where are all\r\n      our ancient Land-surfaces?—The stratified Rocks consist\r\n      of a Series of old Sea-bottoms.—Transformation of a\r\n      Land-surface into a Sea-bottom obliterates all Traces of\r\n      Glaciation.—Why so little remains of the Boulder Clays of\r\n      former Glacial Epochs.—Records of the Glacial Epoch are fast\r\n      disappearing.—Icebergs do not striate the Sea-bottom.—Mr.\r\n      Campbell’s Observations on the Coast of Labrador.—Amount\r\n      of Material transported by Icebergs much exaggerated.—Mr.\r\n      Packard on the Glacial Phenomena of Labrador.—Boulder Clay\r\n      the Product of Land-ice.—Palæontological Evidence.—Paucity of\r\n      Life characteristic of a Glacial Period.—Warm Periods better\r\n      represented by Organic Remains than cold.—Why the Climate\r\n      of the Tertiary Period was supposed to be warmer than the\r\n      present.—Mr. James Geikie on the Defects of Palæontological\r\n      Evidence.—Conclusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Two Reasons why so little is known of former Glacial Epochs._—If the\r\nglacial epoch resulted from the causes discussed in the foregoing\r\nchapters, then such epochs must have frequently supervened. We may,\r\ntherefore, now proceed to consider what evidence there is for the\r\nformer occurrence of excessive conditions of climate during previous\r\ngeological ages. When we begin our inquiry, however, we soon find\r\nthat the facts which have been recorded as evidence in favour of the\r\naction of ice in former geological epochs are very scanty indeed. Two\r\nobvious reasons for this may be given, namely, (1) The imperfection\r\nof the geological records themselves, and (2) the little attention\r\nhitherto paid toward researches of this kind. The notion, once so\r\nprevalent, that the climate of our earth was much warmer in the earlier\r\ngeological ages than it is now, and that it has ever since been\r\ngradually becoming cooler, was wholly at variance with the idea of\r\nformer ice-periods. And this conviction of the _à priori_ improbability\r\nof cold periods having obtained during Palæozoic and Mesozoic ages\r\ntended to prevent due attention being paid to such facts as seemed to\r\nbear upon the subject. But our limited knowledge of former glacial\r\nepochs must no doubt be attributed chiefly to the actual imperfection\r\nof the geological records. So great is this imperfection that the mere\r\nabsence of direct geological evidence cannot reasonably be regarded as\r\nsufficient proof that the conclusions derived from astronomical and\r\nphysical considerations regarding former ice-periods are improbable.\r\nNor is this all. The geological records of ancient glacial conditions\r\nare not only imperfect, but, as I shall endeavour to show, this\r\nimperfection _follows as a natural consequence from the principles of\r\ngeology itself_. There are not merely so many blanks or gaps in the\r\nrecords, but a reason exists in the very nature of geological evidence\r\nwhy such breaks in the record might reasonably be expected to occur.\r\n\r\n_Evidence of Glaciation to be found chiefly on Land-surfaces._—It is on\r\na land-surface that the principal traces of the action of ice during\r\na glacial epoch are left, for it is there that the stones are chiefly\r\nstriated, the rocks ground down, and the boulder clay formed. But where\r\nare all our ancient land-surfaces? They are not to be found. The total\r\nthickness of the stratified rocks of Great Britain is, according to\r\nProfessor Ramsay, nearly fourteen miles. But from the top to the bottom\r\nof this enormous pile of deposits there is hardly a single land-surface\r\nto be detected. True patches of old land-surfaces of a local character\r\nexist, such, for example, as the dirt-beds of Portland; but, with the\r\nexception of coal-seams, every general formation from top to bottom\r\nhas been accumulated under water, and none but the under-clays _ever\r\nexisted as a land_-surface. And it is here, in such a formation,\r\nthat the geologist has to collect all his information regarding the\r\nexistence of former glacial epochs. The entire stratified rocks of the\r\nglobe, with the exception of the coal-beds and under-clays (in neither\r\nof which would one expect to find traces of ice-action), consist almost\r\nentirely of a _series of old sea-bottoms_, with here and there an\r\noccasional freshwater deposit. Bearing this in mind, what is the sort\r\nof evidence which we can now hope to find in these old sea-bottoms of\r\nthe existence of former ice-periods?\r\n\r\nEvery geologist of course admits that the stratified rocks are not\r\nold land-surfaces, but a series of old sea-bottoms formed out of\r\nthe accumulated material derived from the degradation of primeval\r\nland-surfaces. And it is true that all land-surfaces once existed\r\nas sea-bottoms; but the stratified rocks consist of a series of old\r\nsea-bottoms which never were land-surfaces. Many of them no doubt\r\nhave been repeatedly above the sea-level, and may once have possessed\r\nland-surfaces; but these, with the exception of the under-clays of the\r\nvarious coal measures, the dirt-beds of Portland, and one or two more\r\npatches, have all been denuded away. The important bearing which this\r\nconsideration has on the nature of the evidence which we can now expect\r\nto find of the existence of former glacial epochs has certainly been\r\nvery much overlooked.\r\n\r\nIf we examine the matter fully we shall be led to conclude that the\r\n_transformation of a land-surface into a sea-bottom_ will probably\r\ncompletely obliterate every trace of glaciation which that land-surface\r\nmay once have presented. We cannot, for example, expect to meet with\r\npolished and striated stones belonging to a former land glaciation; for\r\nsuch stones are not carried down bodily and unchanged by our rivers\r\nand deposited in the sea. They become broken up by subaërial agencies\r\ninto gravel, sand, and clay, and in this condition are transported\r\nseawards. Nor even if we supposed it possible that the stones and\r\nboulders derived from a mass of till could be carried down to sea by\r\nriver-action, could we at the same time fail to admit that such stones\r\nwould be deprived of all their ice-markings, and become water-worn and\r\nrounded on the way.[137]\r\n\r\nNor can we expect to find boulder clay among the stratified rocks, for\r\nboulder clay is not carried down as such and deposited in the sea, but\r\nunder the influence of the denuding agents becomes broken up into soft\r\nmud, clay, sand, and gravel, as it is gradually peeled off the land and\r\nswept seawards. Patches of boulder clay may have been now and again\r\nforced into the sea by ice and eventually become covered up; but such\r\ncases are wholly exceptional, and their absence in any formation cannot\r\nfairly be adduced as a proof that that formation does not belong to a\r\nglacial period.\r\n\r\nThe only evidence of the existence of land-ice during former periods\r\nwhich we can reasonably expect to meet with in the stratified rocks,\r\nconsists of erratic blocks which may have been transported by icebergs\r\nand dropped into the sea. But unless the glaciers of such epochs\r\nreached the sea, we could not possibly possess even this evidence.\r\nTraces in the stratified rocks of the effects of land-ice during former\r\nepochs must, in the very nature of things, be rare indeed. The only\r\nsort of evidence which, as a general rule, we may expect to detect,\r\nis the presence of large erratic blocks imbedded in strata which from\r\ntheir constitution have evidently been formed in still water. But this\r\nis quite enough; for it proves the existence of ice at the time the\r\nstrata were being deposited as conclusively as though we saw the ice\r\nfloating with the blocks upon it. This sort of evidence, when found in\r\nlow latitudes, ought to be received as conclusive of the existence of\r\nformer glacial epochs; and, no doubt, would have been so received had\r\nit not been for the idea that, if these blocks had been transported\r\nby ice, there ought in addition to have been found striated stones,\r\nboulder clay, and other indications of the agency of land-ice.\r\n\r\nOf course all erratics are not necessarily transported by masses of\r\nice broken from the terminal front of glaciers. The “ice foot,” formed\r\nby the freezing of the sea along the coasts of the higher latitudes of\r\nGreenland, carries seawards immense quantities of blocks and _débris_.\r\nAnd again stones and boulders are frequently frozen into river-ice,\r\nand when the ice breaks up in spring are swept out to sea, and may be\r\ncarried some little distance before they are dropped. But both these\r\ncases can occur only in regions where the winters are excessive; nor\r\nis it at all likely that such ice-rafts will succeed in making a long\r\nvoyage. If, therefore, we could assure ourselves that the erratics\r\noccasionally met with in certain old geological formations in low\r\nlatitudes were really transported from the land by an ice-foot or a\r\nraft of river-ice, we should be forced to conclude that very severe\r\nclimatic conditions must have obtained in such latitudes at the time\r\nthe erratics were dispersed.\r\n\r\nThe reason why we now have, comparatively speaking, so little direct\r\nevidence of the existence of former glacial periods will be more\r\nforcibly impressed upon the mind, if we reflect on how difficult it\r\nwould be in a million or so of years hence to find any trace of what\r\nwe now call the glacial epoch. The striated stones would by that time\r\nbe all, or nearly all, disintegrated, and the till washed away and\r\ndeposited in the bottom of the sea as stratified sands and clays. And\r\nwhen these became consolidated into rock and were raised into dry land,\r\nthe only evidence that we should probably then have that there ever\r\nhad been a glacial epoch would be the presence of large blocks of the\r\nolder rocks, which would be found imbedded in the upraised formation.\r\nWe could only infer that there had been ice at work from the fact that\r\nby no other known agency could we conceive such blocks to have been\r\ntransported and dropped in a still sea.\r\n\r\nProbably few geologists believe that during the Middle Eocene and\r\nthe Upper Miocene periods our country passed through a condition of\r\nglaciation as severe as it has done during the Post-pliocene period;\r\nyet when we examine the subject carefully, we find that there is\r\nactually no just ground to conclude that it has not. For, in all\r\nprobability, throughout the strata to be eventually formed out of the\r\ndestruction of the now existing land-surfaces, evidence of ice-action\r\nwill be as scarce as in Eocene or Miocene strata.\r\n\r\nIf the stratified rocks forming the earth’s crust consisted of a series\r\nof old land-surfaces instead (as they actually do) of a series of old\r\nsea-bottoms, then probably traces of many glacial periods might be\r\ndetected.\r\n\r\nNearly all the evidence which we have regarding the glacial epoch\r\nhas been derived from what we find on the now existing land-surfaces\r\nof the globe. But probably not a vestige of this will exist in the\r\nstratified beds of future ages, formed out of the destruction of the\r\npresent land-surfaces. Even the very arctic shell-beds themselves,\r\nwhich have afforded to the geologist such clear proofs of a frozen sea\r\nduring the glacial epoch, will not be found in those stratified rocks;\r\nfor they must suffer destruction along with everything else which now\r\nexists above the sea-level. There is probably not a single relic of\r\nthe glacial epoch which has ever been seen by the eye of man that will\r\nbe treasured up in the stratified rocks of future ages. Nothing that\r\ndoes not lie buried in the deeper recesses of the ocean will escape\r\ncomplete disintegration and appear imbedded in those formations. It\r\nis only those objects which lie in our existing sea-bottoms that will\r\nremain as monuments of the glacial epoch of the Post-tertiary period.\r\nAnd, moreover, it will only be those portions of the sea-bottoms that\r\nmay happen to be upraised into dry land that will be available to the\r\ngeologist of future ages. The point to be determined now is this:—_Is\r\nit probable that the geologist of the future will find in the rocks\r\nformed out of the now existing sea-bottoms more evidence of a glacial\r\nepoch during Post-tertiary times than we now do of one during, say, the\r\nMiocene, the Eocene, or the Permian period?_ Unless this can be proved\r\nto be the case, we have no ground whatever to conclude that the cold\r\nperiods of the Miocene, Eocene, and Permian periods were not as severe\r\nas that of the glacial epoch. This is evident, for the only relics\r\nwhich now remain of the glacial epochs of those periods are simply\r\nwhat happened to be protected in the then existing sea-bottoms. Every\r\nvestige that lay on the land would in all probability be destroyed by\r\nsubaërial agency and carried into the sea in a sedimentary form. But\r\nbefore we can determine whether or not there is more evidence of the\r\nglacial epoch in our now existing sea-bottoms than there is of former\r\nglacial epochs in the stratified rocks (which are in reality the\r\nsea-bottoms belonging to ancient epochs), we must first ascertain what\r\nis the nature of those marks of glaciation which are to be found in a\r\nsea-bottom.\r\n\r\n_Icebergs do not striate the Sea-bottom._—We know that the rocky face\r\nof the country was ground down and striated during the glacial epoch;\r\nand this is now generally believed to have been done by land-ice. But\r\nwe have no direct evidence that the floor of the ocean, beyond where it\r\nmay have been covered with land-ice, was striated. Beyond the limits\r\nof the land-ice it could be striated only by means of icebergs. But\r\ndo icebergs striate the rocky bed of the ocean? Are they adapted for\r\nsuch work? It seems to be often assumed that they are. But I have been\r\ntotally unable to find any rational grounds for such a belief. Clean\r\nice can have but little or no erosive power, and never could scratch a\r\nrock. To do this it must have grinding materials in the form of sand,\r\nmud, or stones. But the bottoms of icebergs are devoid of all such\r\nmaterials. Icebergs carry the grinding materials on their backs, not on\r\ntheir bottoms. No doubt, when the iceberg is launched into the deep,\r\ngreat masses of sand, mud, and stones will be adhering to its bottom.\r\nBut no sooner is the berg immersed, than a melting process commences\r\nat its sides and lower surface in contact with the water; and the\r\nconsequence is, the materials adhering to the lower surface soon drop\r\noff and sink to the bottom of the sea. The iceberg, divested of these\r\nmaterials, can now do very little harm to the rocky sea-bottom over\r\nwhich it floats. It is true that an iceberg moving with a velocity\r\nof a few miles an hour, if it came in contact with the sea-bottom,\r\nwould, by the mere force of concussion, tear up loose and disjointed\r\nrocks, and hurl some of the loose materials to a distance; but it would\r\ndo but little in the way of grinding down the rock against which it\r\nstruck. But even supposing the bottom of the iceberg were properly\r\nshod with the necessary grinding materials, still it would be but a\r\nvery inefficient grinding agent; for a _floating_ iceberg would not\r\nbe in contact with the sea-bottom. And if it were in contact with the\r\nsea-bottom, it would soon become stranded and, of course, motionless,\r\nand under such conditions could produce no effect.\r\n\r\nIt is perfectly true that although the bottom of the berg may be devoid\r\nof grinding materials, yet these may be found lying on the surface\r\nof the submarine rock over which the ice moves. But it must be borne\r\nin mind that the same current which will move the icebergs over the\r\nsurface of the rock will move the sand, mud, and other materials\r\nover it also; so that the markings effected by the ice would in all\r\nprobability be erased by the current. In the deep recesses of the\r\nocean the water has been found to have but little or no motion. But\r\nicebergs always follow the path of currents; and it is very evident\r\nthat at the comparatively small depth of a thousand feet or so reached\r\nby icebergs the motion of the water will be considerable; and the\r\ncontinual shifting of the small particles of the mud and sand will in\r\nall probability efface the markings which may be made now and again by\r\na passing berg.\r\n\r\nMuch has been said regarding the superiority of icebergs as grinding\r\nand striating agents in consequence of the great velocity of their\r\nmotion in comparison with that of land-ice. But it must be remembered\r\nthat it is while the iceberg is floating, and before it touches the\r\nrock, that it possesses high velocity. When the iceberg runs aground,\r\nits motion is suddenly arrested or greatly reduced. But if the iceberg\r\nadvancing upon a sloping sea-bottom is raised up so as to exert great\r\npressure, it will on this account be the more suddenly arrested,\r\nthe motion will be slow, and the distance passed over short, before\r\nthe berg becomes stranded. If it exerts but little pressure on the\r\nsea-bottom, it may retain a considerable amount of motion and advance\r\nto a considerable distance before it is brought to a stand; but,\r\nexerting little pressure, it can perform but little work. Land-ice\r\nmoves slowly, but then it exerts enormous pressure. A glacier 1,000\r\nfeet in thickness has a pressure on its rocky bed equal to about 25\r\ntons on the square foot; but an iceberg a mile in thickness, forced up\r\non a sloping sea-bottom to an elevation of 20 feet (and this is perhaps\r\nmore than any ocean-current could effect), would only exert a pressure\r\nof about half a ton on the square foot, or about 1/50th part of the\r\npressure of the glacier 1,000 feet in thickness. A great deal has been\r\nsaid about the erosive and crushing power of icebergs of enormous\r\nthickness, as if their thickness gave them any additional pressure. An\r\niceberg 100 feet in thickness will exert just as much pressure as one\r\na mile in thickness. The pressure of an iceberg is not like that of a\r\nglacier, in proportion to its thickness, but to the height to which it\r\nis raised out of the water. An iceberg 100 feet in thickness raised 10\r\nfeet will exert exactly the same pressure as one a mile in thickness\r\nraised to an equal height.\r\n\r\nTo be an efficient grinding agent, steadiness of motion, as well as\r\npressure, is essential. A rolling or rocking motion is ill-adapted\r\nfor grinding down and striating a rock. A steady rubbing motion under\r\npressure is the thing required. But an iceberg is not only deficient in\r\npressure, but also deficient in steadiness of motion. When an iceberg\r\nmoving with considerable velocity comes on an elevated portion of the\r\nsea-bottom, it does not move steadily onwards over the rock, unless\r\nthe pressure of the berg on the rock be trifling. The resistance being\r\nentirely at the bottom of the iceberg, its momentum, combined with the\r\npressure of the current, applied wholly above the point of resistance,\r\ntends to make the berg bend forward, and in some cases upset (when\r\nit is of a cubical form). The momentum of the moving berg, instead\r\nof being applied in forcing it over the rock against which it comes\r\nin contact, is probably all consumed in work against gravitation in\r\nraising the berg upon its front edge. After the momentum is consumed,\r\nunless the berg be completely upset, it will fall back under the force\r\nof gravitation to its original position. But the momentum which it\r\nacquires from gravitation in falling backwards carries it beyond its\r\nposition of repose in an opposite direction. It will thus continue to\r\nrock backwards and forwards until the friction of the water brings it\r\nto rest. The momentum of the berg, instead of being applied to the work\r\nof grinding and striating the sea-bottom, will chiefly be consumed in\r\nheat in the agitation of the water. But if the berg does advance, it\r\nwill do so with a rocking unsteady motion, which, as Mr. Couthouy[138]\r\nand Professor Dana[139] observe, will tend rather to obliterate\r\nstriations than produce them.\r\n\r\nA floating berg moves with great steadiness; but a berg that has run\r\naground cannot advance with a steady motion. If the rock over which the\r\nberg moves offers little resistance, it may do so; but in such a case\r\nthe berg could produce but little effect on the rock.\r\n\r\nDr. Sutherland, who has had good opportunities to witness the effects\r\nof icebergs, makes some most judicious remarks on the subject. “It\r\nwill be well” he says, “to bear in mind that when an iceberg _touches\r\nthe ground, if that ground be hard and resisting, it must come to a\r\nstand_, and the propelling power continuing, a slight leaning over in\r\nthe water, or yielding motion of the whole mass, may compensate readily\r\nfor being so suddenly arrested. If, however, the ground be soft, so\r\nas not to arrest the motion of the iceberg at once, a moraine will be\r\nthe result; but the moraine thus raised will tend to bring it to a\r\nstand.”[140]\r\n\r\nThere is another cause referred to by Professor Dana, which, to a\r\ngreat extent, must prevent the iceberg from having an opportunity of\r\nstriating the sea-bottom, even though it were otherwise well adapted\r\nfor so doing. It is this: the bed of the ocean in the track of\r\nicebergs must be pretty much covered with stones and rubbish dropped\r\nfrom the melting bergs. And this mass of rubbish will tend to protect\r\nthe rock.[141]\r\n\r\nIf icebergs cannot be shown _à priori_, from mechanical considerations,\r\nto be well adapted for striating the sea-bottom, one would naturally\r\nexpect, from the confident way in which it is asserted that they are\r\nso adapted, that the fact has been at least established by actual\r\nobservation. But, strange as it may appear, we seem to have little or\r\nno proof that icebergs actually striate the bed of the ocean. This can\r\nbe proved from the direct testimony of the advocates of the iceberg\r\ntheory themselves.\r\n\r\nWe shall take the testimony of Mr. Campbell, the author of two\r\nwell-known works in defence of the iceberg theory, viz., “Frost and\r\nFire,” and “A Short American Tramp.” Mr. Campbell went in the fall of\r\nthe year 1864 to the coast of Labrador, the Straits of Belle Isle, and\r\nthe Gulf of St. Lawrence, for the express purpose of witnessing the\r\neffects of icebergs, and testing the theory which he had formed, that\r\nthe ice-markings of the glacial epoch were caused by floating ice and\r\nnot by land-ice, as is now generally believed.\r\n\r\nThe following is the result of his observations on the coast of\r\nLabrador.\r\n\r\nHanly Harbour, Strait of Belle Isle:—“The water is 37° F. in July....\r\nAs fast as one island of ice grounds and bursts, another takes its\r\nplace; and in winter the whole strait is blocked up by a mass which\r\nswings bodily up and down, grating along the bottom at all depths....\r\nExamined the beaches and rocks at the water-line, especially in sounds.\r\nFound the rocks ground smooth, _but not striated_, in the sounds”\r\n(_Short American Tramp_, pp. 68, 107).\r\n\r\nCape Charles and Battle Harbour:—“But though these harbours are all\r\nfrozen every winter, the _rocks at the water-line are not striated_”\r\n(p. 68).\r\n\r\nAt St. Francis Harbour:—“The water-line is much rubbed, smooth, _but\r\nnot striated_” (p. 72).\r\n\r\nCape Bluff:—“Watched the rocks with a telescope, and _failed to make\r\nout striæ anywhere_; but the water-line is everywhere rubbed smooth”\r\n(p. 75).\r\n\r\nSeal Islands:—“_No striæ are to be seen at the land-wash in these\r\nsounds or on open sea-coasts near the present water-line_” (p. 76).\r\n\r\nHe only mentions having here found striations in the three following\r\nplaces along the entire coast of Labrador visited by him; and in regard\r\nto two of these, it seems very doubtful that the markings were made by\r\nmodern icebergs.\r\n\r\nMurray’s Harbour:—“This harbour was blocked up with ice on the 20th of\r\nJuly. The water-line is rubbed, and in _some places_ striated” (p. 69).\r\n\r\nPack Island:—“The water-line in a narrow sound was polished and\r\nstriated in the direction of the sound, about N.N.W. This seems to be\r\nfresh work done by heavy ice drifting from Sandwich Bay; _but, on the\r\nother hand, stages with their legs in the sea, and resting on these\r\nvery rocks, are not swept away by the ice_” (p. 96). If these markings\r\nwere modern, why did not the “heavy ice” remove the small fir poles\r\nsupporting the fishing-stages?\r\n\r\nRed Bay:—“Landed half-dressed, and found some striæ perfectly fresh at\r\nthe water-level, but weathered out a short distance _inland_” (p. 107).\r\nThe striations “inland” could not have been made by modern icebergs;\r\nand it does not follow that because the markings at the water-level\r\nwere not weathered they were produced by modern ice.\r\n\r\nThese are the evidences which he found that icebergs striate rocks,\r\non a coast of which he says that, during the year he visited it, “the\r\nwinter-drift was one vast solid raft of floes and bergs more than 150\r\nmiles wide, and perhaps 3,000 feet thick at spots, driven by a whole\r\ncurrent bodily over one definite course, year after year, since this\r\nland was found” (p. 85).\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Campbell himself freely admits that the floating ice which\r\ncomes aground along the shores does not produce striæ. “It is\r\nsufficiently evident,” he says, “_that glacial striæ are not produced\r\nby thin bay-ice_” (p. 76). And in “Frost and Fire,” vol. ii., p. 237,\r\nhe states that, “from a careful examination of the water-line at many\r\nspots, it appears that bay-ice grinds rocks, _but does not produce\r\nstriation_.”\r\n\r\n“It is impossible,” he continues, “to get at rocks over which heavy\r\nicebergs now move; but a mass 150 miles wide, perhaps 3,000 feet thick\r\nin some parts, and moving at the rate of a mile an hour, or more,\r\n_appears to be an engine amply sufficient_ to account for striæ on\r\nrising rocks.” And in “American Tramp,” p. 76, he says, “_striæ must be\r\nmade_ in deep water by the large masses which seem to pursue the even\r\ntenor of their way in the steady current which flows down the coast.”\r\n\r\nMr. Campbell, from a careful examination of the sea-bottom along the\r\ncoast, finds that the small icebergs do not produce striæ, but the\r\nlarge ones, which move over rocks impossible to be got at, “must”\r\nproduce them. They “appear” to be amply sufficient to do so. If the\r\nsmaller bergs cannot striate the sea-bottom, why must the larger ones\r\ndo so? There is no reason why the smaller bergs should not move as\r\nswiftly and exert as much pressure on the sea-bottom as the larger\r\nones. And even supposing that they did not, one would expect that the\r\nlight bergs would effect on a smaller scale what the heavy ones would\r\ndo on a larger.\r\n\r\nI have no doubt that when Mr. Campbell visited Labrador he expected to\r\nfind the sea-coast under the water-line striated by means of icebergs,\r\nand was probably not a little surprised to find that it actually was\r\nnot. And I have no doubt that were the sea-bottom in the tracks of the\r\nlarge icebergs elevated into view, he would find to his surprise that\r\nit was free from striations also.\r\n\r\nSo far as observation is concerned, we have no grounds from what Mr.\r\nCampbell witnessed to conclude that icebergs striate the sea-bottom.\r\n\r\nThe testimony of Dr. Sutherland, who has had opportunities of seeing\r\nthe effects of icebergs in arctic regions, leads us to the same\r\nconclusion. “Except,” he says, “from the evidence afforded by plants\r\nand animals at the bottom, we have _no means whatever_ to ascertain\r\nthe effect produced by icebergs upon the rocks.[142] In the Malegat\r\nand Waigat I have seen whole clusters of these floating islands,\r\ndrawing from 100 to 250 fathoms, moving to and fro with every return\r\nand recession of the tides. I looked very earnestly for grooves and\r\nscratches left by icebergs and glaciers in the rocks, but always failed\r\nto discover any.”[143]\r\n\r\nWe shall now see whether river-ice actually produces striations or not.\r\nIf floating ice under any form can striate rocks, one would expect that\r\nit ought to be done by river-ice, seeing that such ice is obliged to\r\nfollow one narrow definite track.\r\n\r\nSt. John’s River, New Brunswick:—“This river,” says Mr. Campbell,\r\n“is obstructed by ice during five months of the year. When the ice\r\ngoes, there is wild work on the bank. Arrived at St. John, drove\r\nto the suspension-bridge.... At this spot, if _anywhere in the\r\nworld_, river-ice ought to produce striation. The whole drainage of\r\na wide basin and one of the strongest tides in the world, here work\r\ncontinually in one rock-groove; and in winter this water-power is armed\r\nwith heavy ice. _There are no striæ_ about the water-line.”[144]\r\n\r\nRiver St. Lawrence:—“In winter the power of ice-floats driven by\r\nwater-power is tremendous. The river freezes and packs ice till the\r\nflow of water is obstructed. The rock-pass at Quebec is like the\r\nNarrows at St. John’s, Newfoundland. The whole pass, about a mile\r\nwide, was paved with great broken slabs and round boulders of worn ice\r\nas big as small shacks, piled and tossed, and heaped and scattered\r\nupon the level water below and frozen solid.... This kind of ice does\r\nNOT _produce striation_ at the water-margin at Quebec. At Montreal,\r\nwhen the river ‘goes,’ the ice goes with it with a vengeance.... The\r\n_piers are not yet striated_ by river-ice at Montreal.... The rocks\r\nat the high-water level have _no trace_ of glacial striæ.... The rock\r\nat Ottawa is rubbed by river-ice every spring, and _always in one\r\ndirection, but it is not striated_.... The surfaces are all rubbed\r\nsmooth, and the edges of broken beds are rounded where exposed to the\r\nice; _but there are no striæ_.”[145]\r\n\r\nWhen Sir Charles Lyell visited the St. Lawrence in 1842, at Quebec he\r\nwent along with Colonel Codrington “and searched carefully below the\r\ncity in the channel of the St. Lawrence, at low water, near the shore,\r\nfor the signs of glacial action at the precise point where the chief\r\npressure and friction of packed ice are exerted every year,” but found\r\nnone.\r\n\r\n“At the bridge above the Falls of Montmorenci, over which a large\r\nquantity of ice passes every year, the gneiss is polished, and kept\r\nperfectly free from lichens, but not more so than rocks similarly\r\nsituated at waterfalls in Scotland. In none of these places were any\r\nlong straight grooves observable.”[146]\r\n\r\nThe only thing in the shape of modern ice-markings which he seems to\r\nhave met with in North America was a few straight furrows half an inch\r\nbroad in soft sandstone, at the base of a cliff at Cape Blomidon in the\r\nBay of Fundy, at a place where during the preceding winter “packed”\r\nice 15 feet thick had been pushed along when the tide rose over the\r\nsandstone ledges.[147]\r\n\r\nThe very fact that a geologist so eminent as Sir Charles Lyell, after\r\nhaving twice visited North America, and searched specially for modern\r\nice-markings, was able to find only two or three scratches, upon a soft\r\nsandstone rock, which he could reasonably attribute to floating ice,\r\nought to have aroused the suspicion of the advocates of the iceberg\r\ntheory that they had really formed too extravagant notions regarding\r\nthe potency of floating ice as a striating agent.\r\n\r\nThere is no reason to believe that the grooves and markings noticed\r\nby M. Weibye and others on the Scandinavian coast and other parts of\r\nnorthern Europe were made by icebergs.\r\n\r\nProfessor Geikie has clearly shown, from the character and direction\r\nof the markings, that they are the production of land-ice.[148] If\r\nthe floating ice of the St. Lawrence and the icebergs of Labrador are\r\nunable to striate and groove the rocks, it is not likely that those of\r\nnorthern Europe will be able to do so.\r\n\r\nIt will not do for the advocates of the iceberg theory to assume, as\r\nthey have hitherto done, that, as a matter of course, the sea-bottom is\r\nbeing striated and grooved by means of icebergs. They must prove that.\r\nThey must either show that, as a matter of fact, icebergs are actually\r\nefficient agents in striating the sea-bottom, or prove from mechanical\r\nprinciples that they must be so. The question must be settled either by\r\nobservation or by reason; mere opinion will not do.\r\n\r\n_The Amount of Material transported by Icebergs much exaggerated._—The\r\ntransporting of boulders and rubbish, and not the grinding and\r\nstriating of rocks, is evidently the proper function of the iceberg.\r\nBut even in this respect I fear too much has been attributed to it.\r\n\r\nIn reading the details of voyages in the arctic regions one cannot help\r\nfeeling surprised how seldom reference is made to stones and rubbish\r\nbeing seen on icebergs. Arctic voyagers, like other people, when they\r\nare alluding to the geological effects of icebergs, speak of enormous\r\nquantities of stones being transported by them; but in reading the\r\ndetails of their voyages, the impression conveyed is that icebergs with\r\nstones and blocks of rock upon them are the exceptions. The greater\r\nportion of the narratives of voyages in arctic regions consists of\r\ninteresting and detailed accounts of the voyager’s adventures among the\r\nice. The general appearance of the icebergs, their shape, their size,\r\ntheir height, their colour, are all noticed; but rarely is mention\r\nmade of stones being seen. That the greater number of icebergs have\r\nno stones or rubbish on them is borne out by the positive evidence of\r\ngeologists who have had opportunities of seeing icebergs.\r\n\r\nMr. Campbell says:—“It is remarkable that up to this time we have only\r\nseen a few doubtful stones on bergs which we have passed.... Though\r\nno bergs with stones _on them or in them_ have been approached during\r\nthis voyage, many on board the _Ariel_ have been close to bergs heavily\r\nladen.... A man who has had some experience of ice has _never seen a\r\nstone on a berg_ in these latitudes. Captain Anderson, of the _Europa_,\r\nwho is a geologist, has _never seen a stone on a berg_ in crossing the\r\nAtlantic. _No stones were clearly seen on this trip._”[149] Captain Sir\r\nJames Anderson (who has long been familiar with geology, has spent a\r\nconsiderable part of his life on the Atlantic, and has been accustomed\r\nto view the iceberg as a geologist as well as a seaman) has never seen\r\na stone on an iceberg in the Atlantic. This is rather a significant\r\nfact.\r\n\r\nSir Charles Lyell states that, when passing icebergs on the Atlantic,\r\nhe “was most anxious to ascertain whether there was any mud, stones,\r\nor fragments of rocks on any one of these floating masses; but after\r\nexamining about forty of them without perceiving any signs of frozen\r\nmatter, I left the deck when it was growing dusk.”[150] After he had\r\ngone below, one was said to be seen with something like stones upon it.\r\nThe captain and officers of the ship assured him that they had _never\r\nseen a stone upon a berg_.\r\n\r\nThe following extract from Mr. Packard’s “Memoir on the Glacial\r\nPhenomena of Labrador and Maine,” will show how little is effected by\r\nthe great masses of floating ice on the Labrador coast either in the\r\nway of grinding and striating the rocks, or of transporting stones,\r\nclay, and other materials.\r\n\r\n“Upon this coast, which during the summer of 1864 was lined with a\r\nbelt of floe-ice and bergs probably two hundred miles broad, and which\r\nextended from the Gulf of St. Lawrence at Belles Amours to the arctic\r\nseas, this immense body of floating ice seemed _directly_ to produce\r\nbut little alteration in its physical features. If we were to ascribe\r\nthe grooving and polishing of rocks to the action of floating ice-floes\r\nand bergs, how is it that the present shores far above (500), and at\r\nleast 250 feet below, the water-line are often jagged and angular,\r\nthough constantly stopping the course of masses of ice impelled four to\r\nsix miles an hour by the joint action of tides, currents, and winds? No\r\nboulders, or gravel, or mud were seen upon any of the bergs or masses\r\nof shore-ice. They had dropped all burdens of this nature nearer their\r\npoints of detachment in the high arctic regions.” ...\r\n\r\n“This huge area of floating ice, embracing so many thousands of square\r\nmiles, was of greater extent, and remained longer upon the coast, in\r\n1864, than for forty years previous. It was not only pressed upon the\r\ncoast by the normal action of the Labrador and Greenland currents,\r\nwhich, in consequence of the rotatory motion of the earth, tended to\r\nforce the ice in a south-westerly direction, but the presence of the\r\nice caused the constant passage of cooler currents of air from the\r\nsea over the ice upon the heated land, giving rise during the present\r\nseason to a constant succession of north-easterly winds from March\r\nuntil early in August, which further served to crowd the ice into every\r\nharbour and recess upon the coast. It was the universal complaint\r\nof the inhabitants that the easterly winds were more prevalent, and\r\nthe ice ‘held’ later in the harbours this year than for many seasons\r\nprevious. Thus the fisheries were nearly a failure, and vegetation\r\ngreatly retarded in its development. But so far as polishing and\r\nstriating the rocks, depositing drift material, and thus modifying\r\nthe contour of the surface of the present coast, this modern mass of\r\nbergs and floating ice effected comparatively little. Single icebergs,\r\nwhen small enough, entered the harbours, and there stranding, soon\r\npounded to pieces upon the rocks, melted, and disappeared. From Cape\r\nHarrison, in lat. 55°, to Caribo Island, was an interrupted line of\r\nbergs stranded in 80 to 100 or more fathoms, often miles apart, while\r\nothers passed to the seaward down by the eastern coast of Newfoundland,\r\nor through the Straits of Belle Isle.”[151]\r\n\r\n_Boulder Clay the Product of Land-ice._—There is still another point\r\nconnected with icebergs to which we must allude, viz., the opinion\r\nthat great masses of the boulder clay of the glacial epoch were formed\r\nfrom the droppings of icebergs. If boulder clay is at present being\r\naccumulated in this manner, then traces of the boulder clay deposits of\r\nformer epochs might be expected to occur. It is perfectly obvious that\r\n_unstratified_ boulder clay could not have been formed in this way.\r\nStones, gravel, sand, clay, and mud, the ingredients of boulder clay,\r\ntumbled all together from the back of an iceberg, could not sink to the\r\nbottom of the sea without separating. The stones would reach the bottom\r\nfirst, then the gravel, then the sand, then the clay, and last of all\r\nthe mud, and the whole would settle down in a stratified form. But,\r\nbesides, how could the _clay_ be derived from icebergs? Icebergs derive\r\ntheir materials from the land before they are launched into the deep,\r\nand while they are in the form of land-ice. The materials which are\r\nfound on the backs of icebergs are what fell upon the ice from mountain\r\ntops and crags projecting above the ice. Icebergs are chiefly derived\r\nfrom continental ice, such as that of Greenland, where the whole\r\ncountry is buried under one continuous mass, with only a lofty mountain\r\npeak here and there rising above the surface. And this is no doubt\r\nthe chief reason why so few icebergs have stones upon their backs.\r\nThe continental ice of Greenland is not, like the glaciers of the\r\nAlps, covered with loose stones. Dr. Robert Brown informs me that no\r\nmoraine matter has ever been seen on the inland ice of Greenland. It is\r\nperfectly plain that clay does not fall upon the ice. What falls upon\r\nthe ice is stones, blocks of rocks, and the loose _débris_. Clay and\r\nmud we know, from the accounts given by arctic voyagers, are sometimes\r\nwashed down upon the coast-ice; but certainly very little of either can\r\npossibly get upon an iceberg. Arctic voyagers sometimes speak of seeing\r\nclay and mud upon bergs; but it is probable that if they had been near\r\nenough they would have found that what they took for clay and mud were\r\nmerely dust and rubbish.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly the boulder clay of many places bears unmistakable evidence\r\nof having been formed under water; but it does not on that account\r\nfollow that it was formed from the droppings of icebergs. The fact\r\nthat the boulder clay in every case _is chiefly composed of materials\r\nderived from the country on which the clay lies_, proves that it was\r\nnot formed from matter transported by icebergs. The clay, no doubt,\r\ncontains stones and boulders belonging to other countries, which in\r\nsome cases may have been transported by icebergs; but the clay itself\r\nhas not come from another country. But if the clay itself has been\r\nderived from the country on which it lies, then it is absurd to suppose\r\nthat it was deposited from icebergs. The clay and materials which are\r\nfound on icebergs are derived from the land on which the iceberg is\r\nformed; but to suppose that icebergs, after floating about upon the\r\nocean, should always return to the country which gave them birth, and\r\nthere deposit their loads, is rather an extravagant supposition.\r\n\r\nFrom the facts and considerations adduced we are, I would venture to\r\npresume, warranted to conclude that, with the exception of what may\r\nhave been produced by land-ice, very little in the shape of boulder\r\nclay or striated rocks belonging to the glacial epoch lies buried\r\nunder the ocean—and that when the now existing land-surfaces are all\r\ndenuded, probably scarcely a trace of the glacial epoch will then be\r\nfound, except the huge blocks that were transported by icebergs and\r\ndropped into the sea. It is therefore probable that we have as much\r\nevidence of the existence of a glacial epoch during former periods as\r\nthe geologists of future ages will have of the existence of a glacial\r\nepoch during the Post-tertiary period, and that consequently we are not\r\nwarranted in concluding that the glacial epoch was something unique in\r\nthe geological history of our globe.\r\n\r\n_Palæontological Evidence._—It might be thought that if glacial epochs\r\nhave been numerous, we ought to have abundance of palæontological\r\nevidence of their existence. I do not know if this necessarily follows.\r\nLet us take the glacial epoch itself for example, which is quite a\r\nmodern affair. Here we do not require to go and search in the bottom\r\nof the sea for the evidence of its existence; for we have the surface\r\nof the land in almost identically the same state in which it was when\r\nthe ice left it, with the boulder clay and all the wreck of the ice\r\nlying upon it. But what geologist, with all these materials before him,\r\nwould be able to find out from palæontological evidence alone that\r\nthere had been such an epoch? He might search the whole, but would not\r\nbe able to find fossil evidence from which he could warrantably infer\r\nthat the country had ever been covered with ice. We have evidence\r\nin the fossils of the Crag and other deposits of the existence of a\r\ncolder condition of climate prior to the true glacial period, and in\r\nthe shell-beds of the Clyde and other places of a similar state of\r\nmatters after the great ice-sheets had vanished away. But in regard\r\nto the period of the true boulder clay or till, when the country was\r\nenveloped in ice, palæontology has almost nothing whatever to tell\r\nus. “Whatever may be the cause,” says Sir Charles Lyell, “the fact is\r\ncertain that over large areas in Scotland, Ireland, and Wales, I might\r\nadd throughout the northern hemisphere on both sides of the Atlantic,\r\nthe stratified drift of the glacial period is very commonly devoid of\r\nfossils.”[152]\r\n\r\nIn the “flysch” of the Eocene of the Alps, to which we shall have\r\noccasion to refer in the next chapter, in which the huge blocks are\r\nfound which prove the existence of ice-action during that period, few\r\nor no fossils have been found. So devoid of organic remains is that\r\nformation, that it is only from its position, says Sir Charles, that\r\nit is known to belong to the middle or “nummulitic” portion of the\r\ngreat Eocene series. Again, in the conglomerates at Turin, belonging\r\nto the Upper Miocene period, in which the angular blocks of limestone\r\nare found which prove that during that period Alpine glaciers reached\r\nthe sea-level in the latitude of Italy, not a single organic remain has\r\nbeen found. It would seem that an extreme paucity of organic life is a\r\ncharacteristic of a glacial period, which warrants us in concluding\r\nthat the absence of organic remains in any formation otherwise\r\nindicative of a cold climate cannot be regarded as sufficient evidence\r\nthat that formation does not belong to a cold period.\r\n\r\nIn the last chapter it was shown why so little evidence of the warm\r\nperiods of the glacial epoch is now forthcoming. The remains of the\r\n_faunas_ and _floras_ of those periods were nearly wholly destroyed and\r\nswept into the adjoining seas by the ice-sheet that covered the land.\r\nIt is upon the present land-surface that we find the chief evidence\r\nof the last glacial epoch, but the traces of the warm periods of that\r\nepoch are hardly now to be met with in that position since they have\r\nnearly all been obliterated or carried into the sea.\r\n\r\nIn regard to former glacial epochs, however, ice-marked rocks,\r\nscratched stones, moraines, till, &c., no longer exist; the\r\nland-surfaces of those old times have been utterly swept away. The only\r\nevidence, therefore, of such ancient glacial epochs, that we can hope\r\nto detect, must be sought for in the deposits that were laid down upon\r\nthe sea-bottom; where also we may expect to find traces of the warm\r\nperiods that alternated during such epochs with glacial conditions. It\r\nis plain, moreover, that the palæontological evidence in favour of warm\r\nperiods will always be the most abundant and satisfactory.\r\n\r\nJudging from geological evidence alone, we naturally conclude that, as\r\na general rule, the climate of former periods was somewhat warmer than\r\nit is at the present day. It is from fossil remains that the geologist\r\nprincipally forms his estimate of the character of the climate during\r\nany period. Now, in regard to fossil remains, the warm periods will\r\nalways be far better represented than the cold; for we find that, as\r\na _general rule, those formations which geologists are inclined to\r\nbelieve indicate a cold condition of climate are remarkably devoid of\r\nfossil remains_. If a geologist does not keep this principle in view,\r\nhe will be very apt to form a wrong estimate of the general character\r\nof the climate of a period of such enormous length as say the Tertiary.\r\n\r\nSuppose that the presently existing sea-bottoms, which have been\r\nforming since the commencement of the glacial epoch, were to become\r\nconsolidated into rock and thereafter to be elevated into dry land, we\r\nshould then have a formation which might be properly designated the\r\nPost-pliocene. It would represent the time which has elapsed from the\r\nbeginning of the glacial epoch to the present day. Suppose one to be\r\ncalled upon as a geologist to determine from that formation what was\r\nthe general character of the climate during the period in question,\r\nwhat would probably be the conclusion at which he would arrive? He\r\nwould probably find here and there patches of boulder clay containing\r\nstriated and ice-worn stones. Now and again he would meet with bones\r\nof the mammoth and the reindeer, and shells of an arctic type. He\r\nwould likewise stumble upon huge blocks of the older rocks imbedded\r\nin the formation, from which he would infer the existence of icebergs\r\nand glaciers reaching the sea-level. But, on the whole, he would\r\nperceive that the greater portion of the fossil remains met with in\r\nthis formation implied a warm and temperate condition of climate. At\r\nthe lower part of the formation, corresponding to the time of the true\r\nboulder clay, there would be such a scarcity of organic remains that\r\nhe would probably feel at a loss to say whether the climate at that\r\ntime was cold or hot. But if the intense cold of the glacial epoch\r\nwas not continuous, but broken up by intervening warm periods during\r\nwhich the ice, to a considerable extent at least, disappeared for a\r\nlong period of time (and there are few geologists who have properly\r\nstudied the subject who will positively deny that such was the case),\r\nthen the country would no doubt during those warm periods possess an\r\nabundance of plant and animal life. It is quite true that we may almost\r\nsearch in vain on the present land-surface for the organic remains\r\nwhich belonged to those inter-glacial periods; for they were nearly\r\nall swept away by the ice which followed. But no doubt in the deep\r\nrecesses of the ocean, buried under hundreds of feet of sand, mud,\r\nclay, and gravel, lie multitudes of the plants and animals which then\r\nflourished on the land, and were carried down by rivers into the sea.\r\nAnd along with these lie the skeletons, shells, and other exuviæ of\r\nthe creatures which flourished in the warm seas of those periods. Now\r\nlooking at the great abundance of fossils indicative of warm and genial\r\nconditions which the lower portions of this formation would contain,\r\nthe geologist might be in danger of inferring that the earlier part\r\nof the Post-pliocene period was a warmer period, whereas we, at the\r\npresent day, looking at the matter from a different standpoint, declare\r\nthat part to have been characterized by cold or glacial conditions. No\r\ndoubt, if the beds formed during the cold periods of the glacial epoch\r\ncould be distinguished from those formed during the warm periods, the\r\nfossil remains of the one would indicate a cold condition of climate,\r\nand those of the other a warm condition; but still, taking the entire\r\nepoch as a whole, the percentage of fossil remains indicative of a\r\nwarm condition would probably so much exceed that indicative of a cold\r\ncondition, that we should come to the conclusion that the character\r\nof the climate, as a whole, during the epoch in question was warm and\r\nequable.\r\n\r\nAs geologists we have, as a rule, no means of arriving at a knowledge\r\nof the character of the climate of any given period but through an\r\nexamination of the sea-bottoms belonging to that period; for these\r\ncontain all the evidence upon the subject. But unless we exercise\r\ncaution, we shall be very apt, in judging of the climate of such\r\na period, to fall into the same error that we have just now seen\r\none might naturally fall into were he called upon to determine the\r\ncharacter of the climate during the glacial epoch from the nature of\r\nthe organic remains which lie buried in our adjoining seas. On this\r\npoint Mr. J. Geikie’s observations are so appropriate, that I cannot\r\ndo better than introduce them here. “When we are dealing,” says this\r\nwriter, “with formations so far removed from us in time, and in which\r\nthe animal and plant remains depart so widely from existing forms of\r\nlife, we can hardly expect to derive much aid from the fossils in our\r\nattempts to detect traces of cold climatic conditions. The arctic\r\nshells in our Post-tertiary clays are convincing proofs of the former\r\nexistence in our latitude of a severe climate; but when we go so far\r\nback as Palæozoic ages, we have no such clear evidence to guide us.\r\nAll that palæontologists can say regarding the fossils belonging to\r\nthese old times is simply this, that they seem to indicate, generally\r\nspeaking, mild, temperate, or genial, and even sometimes tropical,\r\nconditions of climate. Many of the fossils, indeed, if we are to reason\r\nfrom analogy at all, could not possibly have lived in cold seas. But,\r\nfor aught that we know, there may have been alternations of climate\r\nduring the deposition of each particular formation; and these changes\r\nmay be marked by the presence or absence, or by the greater or less\r\nabundant development, of certain organisms at various horizons in\r\nthe strata. Notwithstanding all that has been done, our knowledge of\r\nthe natural history of these ancient seas is still very imperfect;\r\nand therefore, in the present state of our information, we are not\r\nentitled to argue, from the general aspect of the fossils in our older\r\nformations, that the temperature of the ancient seas was never other\r\nthan mild and genial.”[153]\r\n\r\n_Conclusion._—From what has already been stated it will, I trust, be\r\napparent that, assuming glacial epochs during past geological ages to\r\nhave been as numerous and as severe as the Secular theory demands,\r\nstill it would be unreasonable to expect to meet with abundant traces\r\nof them. The imperfection of the geological record is such that we\r\nought not to be astonished that so few relics of former ice ages have\r\ncome down to us. It will also be apparent that the palæontological\r\nevidence of a warm condition of climate having obtained during any\r\nparticular age, is no proof that a glacial epoch did not also supervene\r\nduring the same cycle of time. Indeed it is quite the reverse; for\r\nthe warm conditions of which we have proof may indicate merely the\r\nexistence of an inter-glacial period. Furthermore, if the Secular\r\ntheory of changes of climate be admitted, then evidence of a warm\r\ncondition of climate having prevailed in arctic regions during any\r\npast geological age may be regarded as presumptive proof of the\r\nexistence of a glacial epoch; that is to say, of an epoch during\r\nwhich cold and warm conditions of climate alternated. Keeping these\r\nconsiderations in view, we shall now proceed to examine briefly what\r\nevidence we at present have of the former existence of glacial epochs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\n            FORMER GLACIAL EPOCHS; GEOLOGICAL EVIDENCE OF.\r\n\r\n  Cambrian Conglomerate of Islay and North-west of\r\n      Scotland.—Ice-action in Ayrshire and Wigtownshire\r\n      during Silurian Period.—Silurian Limestones in Arctic\r\n      Regions.—Professor Ramsay on Ice-action during Old\r\n      Red Sandstone Period.—Warm Climate in Arctic Regions\r\n      during Old Red Sandstone Period.—Professor Geikie and\r\n      Mr. James Geikie on a Glacial Conglomerate of Lower\r\n      Carboniferous Age.—Professor Haughton and Professor Dawson\r\n      on Evidence of Ice-action during Coal Period.—Mr. W.

At Port Askaig, Island of Islay, below a precipitous\r\ncliff of quartzite 70 feet in height, there is a mass of arenaceous\r\ntalcose schist containing fragments of granite, some angular, but\r\nmost of them rounded, and of all sizes, from mere particles to\r\nlarge boulders. As there is no granite in the island from which\r\nthese boulders could have been derived, he justly infers that they\r\nmust have been transported by the agency of ice. The probability\r\nof his conclusion is strengthened by the almost total absence of\r\nstratification in the deposit in question.\r\n\r\n_North-west of Scotland._—Mr. J. Geikie tells me that much of the\r\nCambrian conglomerate in the north-west of Scotland strongly reminds\r\nhim of the coarse shingle beds (Alpine diluvium) which so often crowd\r\nthe old glacial valleys of Switzerland and Northern Italy. In many\r\nplaces the stones of the Cambrian conglomerate have a subangular,\r\nblunted shape, like those of the re-arranged moraine débris of Alpine\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           SILURIAN PERIOD.\r\n\r\n_Wigtownshire._—The possibility of glacial action so far back as\r\nthe Silurian age has been suggested. In beds of slate and shales in\r\nWigtownshire of Lower Silurian age Mr. J. Carrick Moore found beds of\r\nconglomerate of a remarkable character. The fragments generally vary\r\nfrom the size of one inch to a foot in diameter, but in some of the\r\nbeds, boulders of 3, 4, and even 5 feet in diameter occur. There are\r\nno rocks in the neighbourhood from which any of these fragments could\r\nhave been derived. The matrix of this conglomerate is sometimes a green\r\ntrappean-looking sandstone of exceeding toughness, and sometimes an\r\nindurated sandstone indistinguishable from many common varieties of\r\ngreywacke.[155]\r\n\r\n_Ayrshire._—Mr. James Geikie states that in Glenapp, and near\r\nDalmellington, he found embedded in Lower Silurian strata blocks\r\nand boulders from one foot to 5 feet in diameter of gneiss,\r\nsyenite, granite, &c., none of which belong to rocks of those\r\nneighbourhoods.[156] Similar cases have been found in Galway, Ireland,\r\nand at Lisbellaw, south of Enniskillen.[157] In America, Professor\r\nDawson describes Silurian conglomerates with boulders 2 feet in\r\ndiameter.\r\n\r\n_Arctic Regions._—The existence of warm inter-glacial periods\r\nduring that age may be inferred from the fact that in the arctic\r\nregions we find widespread masses of Silurian limestones containing\r\nencrinites, corals, and mollusca, and other fossil remains, for an\r\naccount of which see Professor Haughton’s geological account of the\r\nArctic Archipelago appended to McClintock’s “Narrative of Arctic\r\nDiscoveries.”[158]\r\n\r\n\r\n                          OLD RED SANDSTONE.\r\n\r\n_North of England._—According to Professor Ramsay and some other\r\ngeologists the brecciated, subangular conglomerates and boulder beds\r\nof the Old Red Sandstone of Scotland and the North of England are of\r\nglacial origin. When these conglomerates and the recent boulder clay\r\ncome together it is difficult to draw the line of demarcation between\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nProfessor Ramsay observed some very remarkable facts in connection\r\nwith the Old Red Sandstone conglomerates of Kirkby Lonsdale, and\r\nSedburgh, in Westmoreland and Yorkshire. I shall give the results of\r\nhis observations in his own words.\r\n\r\n“The result is, that we have found many stones and blocks distinctly\r\nscratched, and on others the ghosts of scratches nearly obliterated\r\nby age and chemical action, probably aided by pressure at a time when\r\nthese rocks were buried under thousands of feet of carboniferous\r\nstrata. In some cases, however, the markings were probably produced\r\nwithin the body of the rock itself by pressure, accompanied by\r\ndisturbance of the strata; but in others the longitudinal and cross\r\nstriations convey the idea of glacial action. The shapes of the stones\r\nof these conglomerates, many of which are from 2 to 3 feet long, their\r\nflattened sides and subangular edges, together with the confused manner\r\nin which they are often arranged (like stones in the drift), have\r\nlong been enough to convince me of their ice-borne character; and the\r\nscratched specimens, when properly investigated, may possibly convince\r\nothers.”[159]\r\n\r\n_Isle of Man._—The conglomerate of the Old Red Sandstone in the Isle of\r\nMan has been compared by Mr. Cumming to “a consolidated ancient boulder\r\nclay.” And he remarks, “Was it so that those strange trilobitic-looking\r\nfishes of that era had to endure the buffeting of ice-waves, and to\r\nstruggle amidst the wreck of ice-floes and the crush of bergs?”[160]\r\n\r\n_Australia._—A conglomerate similar to that of Scotland has been found\r\nin Victoria, Australia, by Mr. Selwyn, at several localities. Along\r\nthe Wild Duck Creek, near Heathcote, and also near the Mia-Mia, Spring\r\nPlains, Redesdale, localities in the Colony of Victoria, where it was\r\nexamined by Messrs. Taylor and Etheridge, Junior, this conglomerate\r\nconsists of a mixture of granite pebbles and boulders of various\r\ncolours and textures, porphyries, indurated sandstone, quartz, and\r\na peculiar flint-coloured rock in a matrix of bluish-grey very hard\r\nmud-cement.[161] Rocks similar to the pebbles and blocks composing the\r\nconglomerate do not occur in the immediate neighbourhood; and from the\r\ncurious mixture of large and small angular and water-worn fragments\r\nit was conjectured that it might possibly be of glacial origin.\r\nScratched stones were not observed, although a careful examination was\r\nmade. From similar mud-pebble beds on the Lerderderg River, Victoria,\r\nMr. P. Daintree obtained a few pebbles grooved after the manner of\r\nice-scratched blocks.[162]\r\n\r\nAnd the existence of a warm condition of climate during the Old Red\r\nSandstone period is evidenced by the fossiliferous limestones of\r\nEngland, Russia, and America. On the banks of the Athabasca River,\r\nRupert-Land, Sir John Richardson found beds of limestone containing\r\n_Producti_, _Spiriferi_, an _Orthis_ resembling _O. resupinata_,\r\n_Terebratula reticularis_,[163] and a _Pleurotomaria_, which, in the\r\nopinion of the late Dr. Woodward, who examined the specimens, are\r\ncharacteristic of Devonian rocks of Devonshire.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         CARBONIFEROUS PERIOD.\r\n\r\n_France._—It is now a good many years since Mr. Godwin-Austen directed\r\nattention to what he considered evidence of ice-action during the coal\r\nperiod. This geologist found in the carboniferous strata of France\r\nlarge angular blocks which he could not account for without inferring\r\nthe former action of ice. “Whether from local elevation,” he says,\r\n“or from climatic conditions, there are certain appearances over the\r\nwhole which imply that at one time the temperature must have been very\r\nlow, as glacier-action can alone account for the presence of the large\r\nangular blocks which occur in the lowest detrital beds of many of the\r\nsouthern coal-basins.”[164]\r\n\r\n_Scotland._—In Scotland great beds of conglomerate are met with in\r\nvarious parts, which are now considered by Professor Geikie, Mr.\r\nJames Geikie, and other officers of the Geological Survey who have\r\nhad opportunities of examining them, to be of glacial origin. “They\r\nare,” says Mr. James Geikie, “quite unstratified, and the stones often\r\nshow that peculiar blunted form which is so characteristic of glacial\r\nwork.”[165] Many of the stones found by Professor Geikie, several of\r\nwhich I have had an opportunity of seeing, are well striated.\r\n\r\nIn 1851 Professor Haughton brought forward at the Geological Society\r\nof Dublin, a case of angular fragments of granite occurring in the\r\ncarboniferous limestone of the county of Dublin; and he explained the\r\nphenomena by the supposition of the transporting power of ice.\r\n\r\n_North America._—In one of the North American coal-fields Professor\r\nNewberry found a boulder of quartzite 17 inches by 12 inches, imbedded\r\nin a seam of coal. Similar facts have also been recorded both in the\r\nUnited States, and in Nova Scotia. Professor Dawson describes what he\r\ncalls a gigantic esker of Carboniferous age, on the outside of which\r\nlarge travelled boulders were deposited, probably by drift-ice; while\r\nin the swamps within, the coal flora flourished.[166]\r\n\r\n_India._—Mr. W. T. Blanford, of the Geological Survey of India, states\r\nthat in beds considered to be of Carboniferous age are found large\r\nboulders, some of them as much as 15 feet in diameter. The bed in\r\nwhich these occur is a fine silt, and he refers the deposition of the\r\nboulders to ice-action. Within the last three years his views have\r\nreceived singular confirmation in another part of India, where beds\r\nof limestone were found striated below certain overlying strata. The\r\nprobability that these appearances are due, as Mr. Blanford says, to\r\nthe action of ice, is strengthened by the consideration that about five\r\ndegrees farther to the north of the district in question rises the\r\ncold and high table-land of Thibet, which during a glacial epoch would\r\nundoubtedly be covered with ice that might well descend over the plains\r\nof India.[167]\r\n\r\n_Arctic Regions._—A glacial epoch during the Carboniferous age may be\r\nindirectly inferred from the probable existence of warm inter-glacial\r\nperiods, as indicated by the limestones with fossil remains found in\r\narctic regions.\r\n\r\nThat an equable condition of climate extended to near the north pole\r\nis proved by the fact that in the arctic regions vast masses of\r\ncarboniferous limestone, having all the characters of the mountain\r\nlimestone of England, have been found. “These limestones,” says\r\nMr. Isbister, “are most extensively developed in the north-east\r\nextremity of the continent, where they occupy the greater part of\r\nthe coast-line, from the north side of the Kotzebue Sound to within\r\na few miles of Point Barrow, and form the chief constituent of the\r\nlofty and conspicuous headlands of Cape Thomson, Cape Lisburn, and\r\nCape Sabine.”[168] Limestone of the same age occurs extensively\r\nalong the Mackenzie River. The following fossils have been found\r\nin these limestones:—_Terebratula resupinata_,[169] _Lithostrotion\r\nbasaltiforme_, _Cyathophyllum dianthum_, _C. flexuosum_, _Turbinolia\r\nmitrata_, _Productus Martini_,[170] _Dentalium Sarcinula_,\r\n_Spiriferi_, _Orthidæ_, and encrinital fragments in the greatest\r\nabundance.\r\n\r\nAmong the fossils brought home from Depôt Point, Albert Land, by\r\nSir E. Belcher, Mr. Salter found the following, belonging to the\r\nCarboniferous period:—_Fusulina hyperborea_, _Stylastrea inconferta_,\r\n_Zaphrentis ovibos_, _Clisiophyllum tumulus_, _Syringopora (Aulopora)_,\r\n_Fenestella Arctica_, _Spirifera Keilhavii_, _Productus cora_, _P.\r\nsemireticulatus_.[171]\r\n\r\nCoal-beds of Carboniferous age are extensively developed in arctic\r\nregions. The fuel is of a highly bituminous character, resembling, says\r\nProfessor Haughton, the gas coals of Scotland. The occurrence of coal\r\nin such high latitudes indicates beyond doubt that a mild and temperate\r\ncondition of climate must, during some part of the Carboniferous age,\r\nhave prevailed up to the very pole.\r\n\r\n“In the coal of Jameson’s Land, on the east side of Greenland, lying\r\nin latitude 71°, and in that of Melville Island, in latitude 75° N.,\r\nProfessor Jameson found plants resembling fossils of the coal-fields of\r\nBritain.”[172]\r\n\r\n\r\n                            PERMIAN PERIOD.\r\n\r\n_England._—From the researches of Professor Ramsay in the Permian\r\nbreccias, we have every reason to believe that during a part of the\r\nPermian age our country was probably covered with glaciers reaching\r\nto the sea. These brecciated stones, he states, are mostly angular\r\nor subangular, with flattened sides and but very slightly rounded at\r\nthe edges, and are imbedded in a deep red marly paste. At Abberley\r\nHill some of the masses are from 2 to 3 feet in diameter, and in one\r\nof the quarries, near the base of Woodbury Hill, Professor Ramsay\r\nsaw one 2 feet in diameter. Another was observed at Woodbury Rock, 4\r\nfeet long, 3 feet broad, and 1½ feet thick. The boulders were found\r\nin South Staffordshire, Enville, in Abberley and Malvern Hills,\r\nand other places. “They seem,” he says, “to have been derived from\r\nthe conglomerate and green, grey, and purple Cambrian grits of the\r\nLongmynd, and from the Silurian quartz-rocks, slates, felstones,\r\nfelspathic ashes, greenstones, and Upper Caradoc rocks of the country\r\nbetween the Longmynd and Chirbury. But then,” he continues, “the south\r\nend of the Malvern Hills is from forty to fifty miles, the Abberleys\r\nfrom twenty-five to thirty-five miles, Enville from twenty to thirty\r\nmiles, and South Staffordshire from thirty-five to forty miles distant\r\nfrom that country.”[173]\r\n\r\nIt is physically impossible, Professor Ramsay remarks, that these\r\nblocks could have been transported to such distances by any other\r\nagency than that of ice. Had they been transported by water, supposing\r\nsuch a thing possible, they would have been rounded and water-worn,\r\nwhereas many of these stones are flat slabs, and most of them have\r\ntheir edges but little rounded. And besides many of them are highly\r\npolished, and others grooved and finely striated, exactly like those of\r\nthe ancient glaciers of Scotland and Wales. Some of these specimens are\r\nto be seen in the Museum of Practical Geology, Jermyn Street.\r\n\r\n_Scotland._—In the Island of Arran, Mr. E. A. Wunsch and Mr. James\r\nThomson found a bed of conglomerate which they considered of Permian\r\nage, and probably of glacial origin. This conglomerate enclosed angular\r\nfragments of various schistose, volcanic, and limestone rocks, and\r\ncontained carboniferous fossils.\r\n\r\n_Ireland._—At Armagh, Ireland, Professor Hull found boulder beds of\r\nPermian age, containing pebbles and boulders, sometimes 2 feet in\r\ndiameter. Some of the boulders must have been transported from a\r\nregion lying about 30 miles to the north-west of the locality in which\r\nthey now occur. It is difficult to conceive, says Professor Hull,\r\nhow rock fragments of such a size could have been carried to their\r\npresent position by any other agency than that of floating ice. This\r\nboulder-bed is overlaid by a recent bed of boulder clay. Professor\r\nRamsay, who also examined the section, agrees with Professor Hull that\r\nthe bed is of Permian age, and unquestionably of ice-formation.[174]\r\n\r\nProfessor Ramsay feels convinced that the same conclusions which he has\r\ndrawn in regard to the Permian breccia of England will probably yet be\r\nfound to hold good in regard to much of that of North Germany.[175] And\r\nthere appears to be some ground for concluding that the cold of that\r\nperiod even reached to India.[176]\r\n\r\n_South Africa._—An ancient boulder clay, supposed to be either\r\nof Permian or Jurassic age, has been extensively found in Natal,\r\nSouth Africa. This deposit, discovered by Dr. Sutherland, the\r\nSurveyor-General of the colony, is thus described by Dr. Mann:—\r\n\r\n“The deposit itself consists of a greyish-blue argillaceous matrix,\r\ncontaining fragments of granite, gneiss, graphite, quartzite,\r\ngreenstone, and clay-slate. These imbedded fragments are of various\r\nsize, from the minute dimensions of sand-grains up to vast blocks\r\nmeasuring 6 feet across, and weighing from 5 to 10 tons. They are\r\nsmoothed, as if they had been subject to a certain amount of attrition\r\nin a muddy sediment; but they are not rounded like boulders that\r\nhave been subjected to sea-breakers. The fracture of the rock is not\r\nconchoidal, and there is manifest, in its substance, a rude disposition\r\ntowards wavy stratification.”\r\n\r\n“Dr. Sutherland inclines to think that the transport of vast massive\r\nblocks of several tons’ weight, the scoring of the subjacent surfaces\r\nof sandstone, and the simultaneous deposition of minute sand-grains\r\nand large boulders in the same matrix, all point to one agency as the\r\nonly one which can be rationally admitted to account satisfactorily\r\nfor the presence of this remarkable formation in the situations in\r\nwhich it is found. He believes that the boulder-bearing clay of Natal\r\nis of analogous nature to the great Scandinavian drift, to which it\r\nis certainly intimately allied in intrinsic mineralogical character;\r\nthat it is virtually a vast moraine of olden time; and that ice, in\r\nsome form or other, has had to do with its formation, at least so far\r\nas the deposition of the imbedded fragments in the amorphous matrix are\r\nconcerned.”[177]\r\n\r\nIn the discussion which followed the reading of Dr. Sutherland’s paper,\r\nProfessor Ramsay pointed out that in the Natal beds enormous blocks of\r\nrock occurred, which were 60 or 80 miles from their original home, and\r\nstill remained angular; and there was a difficulty in accounting for\r\nthe phenomena on any other hypothesis than that suggested.\r\n\r\nMr. Stow, in his paper on the Karoo beds, has expressed a similar\r\nopinion regarding the glacial character of the formation.[178]\r\n\r\nBut we have in the Karoo beds evidence not only of glaciation, but of a\r\nmuch warmer condition of things than presently exists in that latitude.\r\nThis is shown from the fact that the shells of the _Trigona_-beds\r\nindicate a tropical or subtropical condition of climate.\r\n\r\n_Arctic Regions._—The evidence which we have of the existence of a\r\nwarm climate during the Permian period is equally conclusive. The\r\nclose resemblance of the _flora_ of the Permian period to that of\r\nCarboniferous times evidently points to the former prevalence of a warm\r\nand equable climate. And the existence of the magnesian limestone in\r\nhigh latitudes seems to indicate that during at least a part of the\r\nPermian period, just as during the accumulation of the carboniferous\r\nlimestone, a warm sea must have obtained in those latitudes.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            OOLITIC PERIOD.\r\n\r\n_North of Scotland._—There is not wanting evidence of something like\r\nthe action of ice during the Oolitic period.[179]\r\n\r\nIn the North of Scotland Mr. James Geikie says there is a coarse\r\nboulder conglomerate associated with the Jurassic strata in the east\r\nof Sutherland, the possibly glacial origin of which long ago suggested\r\nitself to Professor Ramsay and other observers. Mr. Judd believes the\r\nboulders to have been floated down by ice from the Highland mountains\r\nat the time the Jurassic strata were being accumulated.\r\n\r\n_North Greenland._—During the Oolitic period a warm condition of\r\nclimate extended to North Greenland. For example, in Prince Patrick’s\r\nIsland, at Wilkie Point, in lat. 76° 20′ N., and long. 117° 20′\r\nW., Oolitic rocks containing an ammonite (_Ammonites McClintocki_,\r\nHaughton), like _A. concavus_ and other shells of Oolitic species,\r\nwere found by Captain McClintock.[180] In Katmai Bay, near Behring’s\r\nStraits, the following Oolitic fossils were discovered—_Ammonites\r\nWasnessenskii_, _A. biplex_, _Belemnites paxillosus_, and _Unio\r\nliassinus_.[181] Captain McClintock found at Point Wilkie, in Prince\r\nPatrick’s Island, lat. 76° 20′, a bone of _Ichthyosaurus_, and Sir E.\r\nBelcher found in Exmouth Island, lat. 76° 16′ N., and long. 96° W., at\r\nan elevation of 570 feet above the level of the sea, bones which were\r\nexamined by Professor Owen, and pronounced to be those of the same\r\nanimal.[182] Mr. Salter remarks that at the time that these fossils\r\nwere deposited, “a condition of climate something like that of our own\r\nshores was prevailing in latitudes not far short of 80° N.”[183] And\r\nMr. Jukes says that during the Oolitic period, “in latitudes where\r\nnow sea and land are bound in ice and snow throughout the year, there\r\nformerly flourished animals and plants similar to those living in our\r\nown province at that time. The questions thus raised,” continues Mr.\r\nJukes, “as to the climate of the globe when cephalopods and reptiles\r\nsuch as we should expect to find only in warm or temperate seas,\r\ncould live in such high latitudes, are not easy to answer.”[184] And\r\nProfessor Haughton remarks, that he thinks it highly improbable that\r\nany change in the position of land and water could ever have produced a\r\ntemperature in the sea at 76° north latitude which would allow of the\r\nexistence of ammonites, especially species so like those that lived\r\nat the same time in the tropical warm seas of the South of England\r\nand France at the close of the Liassic, and commencement of the Lower\r\nOolitic period.[185]\r\n\r\nThe great abundance of the limestone and coal of the Oolitic system\r\nshows also the warm and equable condition of the climate which must\r\nhave then prevailed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          CRETACEOUS PERIOD.\r\n\r\n_Croydon._—A large block of crystalline rock resembling granite was\r\nfound imbedded in a pit, on the side of the old London and Brighton\r\nroad near Purley, about two miles south of Croydon. Mr. Godwin-Austen\r\nhas shown conclusively that it must have been transported there by\r\nmeans of floating ice. This boulder was associated with loose sea-sand,\r\ncoarse shingle, and a smaller boulder weighing twenty or twenty-five\r\npounds, and all water-worn. These had all sunk together without\r\nseparating. Hence they must have been firmly held together, both during\r\nthe time that they were being floated away, and also whilst sinking to\r\nthe bottom of the cretaceous sea. Mr. Godwin-Austen supposes the whole\r\nto have been carried away frozen to the bottom of a mass of ground-ice.\r\nWhen the ice from melting became unable to float the mass attached to\r\nit, the whole would then sink to the bottom together.[186]\r\n\r\n_Dover._—While the workmen were employed in cutting the tunnel on\r\nthe London, Chatham, and Dover Railway, between Lydden Hill and\r\nShepherdswell, a few miles from Dover, they came upon a mass of coal\r\nimbedded in chalk, at a depth of 180 feet. It was about 4 feet square,\r\nand from 4 to 10 inches thick. The coal was friable and highly\r\nbituminous. It resembled some of the Wealden or Jurassic coal, and\r\nwas unlike the true coal of the coal-measures. The specific gravity\r\nof the coal precluded the supposition that it could have floated away\r\nof itself into the cretaceous sea. “Considering its friability,” says\r\nMr. Godwin-Austen, “I do not think that the agency of a floating tree\r\ncould have been engaged in its transport; but, looking at its flat,\r\nangular form, it seems to me that its history may agree with what I\r\nhave already suggested with reference to the boulder in the chalk\r\nat Croydon. We may suppose that during the Cretaceous period some\r\nbituminous beds of the preceding Oolitic period lay so as to be covered\r\nwith water near the sea-margin, or along some river-bank, and from\r\nwhich portions could be carried off by ice, and so drifted away, until\r\nthe ice was no longer able to support its load.”[187]\r\n\r\nMr. Godwin-Austen then mentions a number of other cases of blocks\r\nbeing found in the chalk. In regard to those cases he appropriately\r\nremarks that, as the cases where the occurrence of such blocks has\r\nbeen observed are likely to be far less numerous than those which have\r\nescaped observation, or failed to have been recorded, and as the chalk\r\nexposed in pits and quarries bears only a most trifling proportion to\r\nthe whole horizontal extent of the formation, we have no grounds to\r\nconclude that the above are exceptional cases.\r\n\r\nBoulders have also been found in the cretaceous strata of the Alps by\r\nEscher von der Linth.[188]\r\n\r\nThe existence of warm periods during the Cretaceous age is plainly\r\nshown by the character of the flora and fauna of that age. The fact\r\nthat chalk is of organic origin implies that the climate must have\r\nbeen warm and genial, and otherwise favourable to animal life. This is\r\nfurther manifested by such plants as _Cycas_ and _Zamia_, which betoken\r\na warm climate, and by the corals and huge sauroid reptiles which then\r\ninhabited our waters.\r\n\r\nIt is, in fact, the tropical character of the fauna of that period\r\nwhich induced Sir Charles Lyell to reject Mr. Godwin-Austen’s idea that\r\nthe boulders found in the chalk had been transported by floating ice.\r\nSuch a supposition, implying a cold climate, “is,” Sir Charles says,\r\n“inconsistent with the luxuriant growth of large chambered univalves,\r\nnumerous corals, and many fish, and other fossils of tropical forms.”\r\n\r\nThe recent discovery of the Cretaceous formation in Greenland shows\r\nthat during that period a mild and temperate condition of climate\r\nmust have prevailed in that continent up to high latitudes. “This\r\nformation in Greenland,” says Dr. Robert Brown, “has only been recently\r\nseparated from the Miocene formation, with which it is associated and\r\nwas supposed to be a part of. It is, as far as we yet know, only found\r\nin the vicinity of Kome or Koke, near the shores of Omenak Fjord, in\r\nabout 70° north latitude, though traces have been found elsewhere\r\non Disco, &c. The fossils hitherto brought to Europe have been very\r\nfew, and consist of plants which are now preserved in the Stockholm\r\nand Copenhagen Museums. From these there seems little doubt that the\r\nage assigned to this limited deposit (so far as we yet know) by the\r\ncelebrated palæontologist, Professor Oswald Heer, of Zurich, is the\r\ncorrect one.”[189] Dr. Brown gives a list of the Cretaceous flora found\r\nin Greenland.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            EOCENE PERIOD.\r\n\r\n_Switzerland._—In a coarse conglomerate belonging to the “_flysch_”\r\nof Switzerland, an Eocene formation, there are found certain immense\r\nblocks, some of which consist of a variety of granite which is not\r\nknown to occur _in situ_ in any part of the Alps. Some of the blocks\r\nare 10 feet and upwards in length, and one at Halekeren, at the Lake of\r\nThun, is 105 feet in length, 90 feet in breadth, and 45 feet in height.\r\nSimilar blocks are found in the Apennines. These unmistakably indicate\r\nthe presence of glaciers or floating ice. This conclusion is further\r\nborne out by the fact that the “_flysch_” is destitute of organic\r\nremains. But the hypothesis that these huge masses were transported\r\nto their present sites by glaciers or floating ice has been always\r\nobjected to, says Sir Charles Lyell, “on the ground that the Eocene\r\nstrata of Nummulitic age in Switzerland, as well as in other parts of\r\nEurope, contain genera of fossil plants and animals characteristic of a\r\nwarm climate. And it has been particularly remarked,” he continues, “by\r\nM. Desor that the strata most nearly associated with the ‘_flysch_’ in\r\nthe Alps are rich in echinoderms of the _Spatangus_ family which have a\r\ndecided tropical aspect.”[190]\r\n\r\nBut according to the theory of Secular Changes of Climate, the very\r\nfact that the “_flysch_” is immediately associated with beds indicating\r\na warm or even tropical condition of climate, is one of the strongest\r\nproofs which could be adduced in favour of its glacial character, for\r\nthe more severe a cold period of a glacial epoch is, the warmer will be\r\nthe periods which immediately precede and succeed. These crocodiles,\r\ntortoises, and tropical flora probably belong to a warm Eocene\r\ninter-glacial period.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            MIOCENE PERIOD.\r\n\r\n_Italy._—We have strong evidence in favour of the opinion that a\r\nglacial epoch existed during the Miocene period. It has been shown\r\nby M. Gastaldi, that during that age Alpine glaciers extended to the\r\nsea-level.\r\n\r\nNear Turin there is a series of hills, rising about 500 or 600 feet\r\nabove the valleys, composed of beds of Miocene sandstone, marl, and\r\ngravel, and loose conglomerate. These beds have been carefully examined\r\nand described by M. Gastaldi.[191] The hill of the Luperga has been\r\nparticularly noticed by him. Many of the stones in these beds are\r\nstriated in a manner similar to those found in the true till or boulder\r\nclay of this country. But what is most remarkable is the fact that\r\nlarge erratic blocks of limestone, many of them from 10 to 15 feet in\r\ndiameter, are found in abundance in these beds. It has been shown by\r\nGastaldi that these blocks have all been derived from the outer ridge\r\nof the Alps on the Italian side, namely, from the range extending from\r\nIvrea to the Lago Maggiore, and consequently they must have travelled\r\nfrom twenty to eighty miles. So abundant are these large blocks, that\r\nextensive quarries have been opened in the hills for the sake of\r\nprocuring them. These facts prove not only the existence of glaciers\r\non the Alps during the Miocene period, but of glaciers extending to\r\nthe sea and breaking up into icebergs; the stratification of the beds\r\namongst which the blocks occur sufficiently indicating aqueous action\r\nand the former presence of the sea.\r\n\r\nThat the glaciers of the Southern Alps actually reached to the sea,\r\nand sent their icebergs adrift over what are now the sunny plains of\r\nNorthern Italy, is sufficient proof that during the cold period of\r\nMiocene times the climate must have been very severe. Indeed, it may\r\nwell have been as severe as, if not even more excessive than, the\r\nintensest severity of climate experienced during the last great glacial\r\nepoch.\r\n\r\n_Greenland._—Of the existence of warm conditions during Miocene times,\r\ngeology affords us abundant evidence. I shall quote the opinion of Sir\r\nCharles Lyell on this point:—\r\n\r\n“We know,” says Sir Charles, “that Greenland was not always covered\r\nwith snow and ice; for when we examine the tertiary strata of Disco\r\nIsland (of the Upper Miocene period), we discover there a multitude\r\nof fossil plants which demonstrate that, like many other parts of the\r\narctic regions, it formerly enjoyed a mild and genial climate. Among\r\nthe fossils brought from that island, lat. 70° N., Professor Heer has\r\nrecognised _Sequoia Landsdorfii_, a coniferous species which flourished\r\nthroughout a great part of Europe in the Miocene period. The same\r\nplant has been found fossil by Sir John Richardson within the Arctic\r\nCircle, far to the west on the Mackenzie River, near the entrance of\r\nBear River; also by some Danish naturalists in Iceland, to the east.\r\nThe Icelandic surturband or lignite, of this age, has also yielded a\r\nrich harvest of plants, more than thirty-one of them, according to\r\nSteenstrup and Heer, in a good state of preservation, and no less than\r\nfifteen specifically identical with Miocene plants of Europe. Thirteen\r\nof the number are arborescent; and amongst others is a tulip-tree\r\n(_Liriodendron_), with its fruit and characteristic leaves, a plane\r\n(_Platanus_), a walnut, and a vine, affording unmistakable evidence\r\nof a climate in the parallel of the Arctic Circle which precludes the\r\nsupposition of glaciers then existing in the neighbourhood, still less\r\nany general crust of continental ice like that of Greenland.”[192]\r\n\r\nAt a meeting of the British Association, held at Nottingham in August\r\n1866, Professor Heer read a valuable paper on the “Miocene Flora of\r\nNorth Greenland.” In this paper some remarkable conclusions as to the\r\nprobable temperature of Greenland during the Miocene period were given.\r\n\r\nUpwards of sixty different species brought from Atanekerdluk, a place\r\non the Waigat opposite Disco, in lat. 70° N., have been examined by him.\r\n\r\nA steep hill rises on the coast to a height of 1,080 feet, and at\r\nthis level the fossil plants are found. Large quantities of wood in\r\na fossilized or carbonized condition lie about. Captain Inglefield\r\nobserved one trunk thicker than a man’s body standing upright. The\r\nleaves, however, are the most important portion of the deposit. The\r\nrock in which they are found is a sparry iron ore, which turns reddish\r\nbrown on exposure to the weather. In this rock the leaves are found, in\r\nplaces packed closely together, and many of them are in a very perfect\r\ncondition. They give us a most valuable insight into the nature of the\r\nvegetation which formed this primeval forest.\r\n\r\nHe arrives at the following conclusions:—\r\n\r\n1. _The fossilized plants of Atanekerdluk cannot have been drifted from\r\nany great distance. They must have grown on the spot where they were\r\nfound._\r\n\r\nThis is shown—\r\n\r\n(_a_) By the fact that Captain Inglefield and Dr. Ruik observed trunks\r\nof trees standing upright.\r\n\r\n(_b_) By the great abundance of the leaves, and the perfect state of\r\npreservation in which they are found.\r\n\r\n(_c_) By the fact that we find in the stone both fruits and seeds of\r\nthe trees whose leaves are also found there.\r\n\r\n(_d_) By the occurrence of insect remains along with the leaves.\r\n\r\n2. _The flora of Atanekerdluk is Miocene._\r\n\r\n3. _The flora is rich in species._\r\n\r\n4. _The flora proves without a doubt that North Greenland, in the\r\nMiocene epoch, had a climate much warmer than its present one. The\r\ndifference must be at least_ 29° F.\r\n\r\nProfessor Heer discusses at considerable length this proposition. He\r\nsays that the evidence from Greenland gives a final answer to those\r\nwho objected to the conclusions as to the Miocene climate of Europe\r\ndrawn by him on a former occasion. It is quite impossible that the\r\ntrees found at Atanekerdluk could ever have flourished there if\r\nthe temperature were not far higher than it is at present. This is\r\nclear from many of the species, of which we find the nearest living\r\nrepresentative 10° or even 20° of latitude to the south of the locality\r\nin question.\r\n\r\nThe trees of Atanekerdluk were not, he says, all at the extreme\r\nnorthern limit of their range, for in the Miocene flora of Spitzbergen,\r\nlat. 78° N., we find the beech, plane, hazelnut, and some other species\r\nidentical with those from Greenland, and we may conclude, he thinks,\r\nthat the firs and poplars which we meet at Atanekerdluk and Bell Sound,\r\nSpitzbergen, must have reached up to the North Pole if land existed\r\nthere in the tertiary period.\r\n\r\n“The hills of fossilized wood,” he adds, “found by McClure and his\r\ncompanions in Banks’s Land (lat. 74° 27′ N.), are therefore discoveries\r\nwhich should not astonish us, they only confirm the evidence as to the\r\noriginal vegetation of the polar regions which we have derived from\r\nother sources.”\r\n\r\nThe _Sequoia landsdorfii_ is the most abundant of the trees of\r\nAtanekerdluk. The _Sequoia sempervirens_ is its present representative.\r\nThis tree has its extreme northern limit about lat. 53° N. For its\r\nexistence it requires a summer temperature of 59° or 61° F. Its fruit\r\nrequires a temperature of 64° for ripening. The winter temperature must\r\nnot fall below 34°, and that of the whole year must be at least 49°.\r\nThe temperature of Atanekerdluk during the time that the Miocene flora\r\ngrew could not have been under the above.[193]\r\n\r\nProfessor Heer concludes his paper as follows:—\r\n\r\n“I think these facts are convincing, and the more so that they are not\r\ninsulated, but confirmed by the evidence derivable from the Miocene\r\nflora of Iceland, Spitzbergen, and Northern Canada. These conclusions,\r\ntoo, are only links in the grand chain of evidence obtained from the\r\nexamination of the Miocene flora of the whole of Europe. They prove to\r\nus that we could not by any re-arrangement of the relative positions\r\nof land and water produce for the northern hemisphere a climate which\r\nwould explain the phenomena in a satisfactory manner. We must only\r\nadmit that we are face to face with a problem, whose solution in all\r\nprobability must be attempted, and, we doubt not, completed by the\r\nastronomer.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\n         GEOLOGICAL TIME.—PROBABLE DATE OF THE GLACIAL EPOCH.\r\n\r\n  Geological Time measurable from Astronomical Data.—M. Leverrier’s\r\n      Formulæ.—Tables of Eccentricity for 3,000,000 Years in the\r\n      Past and 1,000,000 Years in the Future.—How the Tables have\r\n      been computed.—Why the Glacial Epoch is more recent than had\r\n      been supposed.—Figures convey a very inadequate Conception\r\n      of immense Duration.—Mode of representing a Million of\r\n      Years.—Probable Date of the Glacial Epoch.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf those great Secular variations of climate which we have been\r\nconsidering be indirectly the result of changes in the eccentricity\r\nof the earth’s orbit, then we have a means of determining, at least\r\nso far as regards recent epochs, when these variations took place.\r\nIf the glacial epoch be due to the causes assigned, we have a means\r\nof ascertaining, with tolerable accuracy, not merely the date of its\r\ncommencement, but the length of its duration. M. Leverrier has not\r\nonly determined the superior limit of the eccentricity of the earth’s\r\norbit, but has also given formulæ by means of which the extent of the\r\neccentricity for any period, past or future, may be computed.\r\n\r\nA well-known astronomer and mathematician, who has specially\r\ninvestigated the subject, is of opinion that these formulæ give results\r\nwhich may be depended upon as approximately correct for _four millions\r\nof years_ past and future. An eminent physicist has, however, expressed\r\nto me his doubts as to whether the results can be depended on for a\r\nperiod so enormous. M. Leverrier in his Memoir has given a table of the\r\neccentricity for 100,000 years before and after 1800 A.D., computed\r\nfor intervals of 10,000 years. This table, no doubt, embraces a period\r\nsufficiently great for ordinary astronomical purposes, but it is by far\r\ntoo limited to afford information in regard to geological epochs.\r\n\r\nWith the view of ascertaining the probable date of the glacial epoch,\r\nas well as the character of the climate for a long course of ages,\r\nTable I. was computed from M. Leverrier’s formulæ.[194] It shows the\r\neccentricity of the earth’s orbit and longitude of the perihelion for\r\n3,000,000 of years back, and 1,000,000 of years to come, at periods\r\n50,000 years apart.\r\n\r\nOn looking over the table it will be seen that there are three\r\nprincipal periods when the eccentricity rose to a very high value,\r\nwith a few subordinate maxima between. It will be perceived also that\r\nduring each of those periods the eccentricity does not remain at the\r\nsame uniform value, but rises and falls, in one case twice, and in the\r\nother two cases three times. About 2,650,000 years back we have the\r\neccentricity almost at its inferior limit. It then begins to increase,\r\nand fifty thousand years afterwards, namely at 2,600,000 years ago, it\r\nreaches ·0660; fifty thousand years after this period it has diminished\r\nto ·0167, which is about its present value. It then begins to increase,\r\nand in another fifty thousand years, namely at 2,500,000 years ago, it\r\napproaches to almost the superior limit, its value being then ·0721. It\r\nthen begins to diminish, and at 2,450,000 years ago it has diminished\r\nto ·0252. These two maxima, separated by a minimum and extending over a\r\nperiod of 200,000 years, constitute the first great period of high\r\neccentricity. We then pass onwards for upwards of a million and a half\r\nyears, and we come to the second great period. It consists of three\r\nmaxima separated by two minima. The first maximum occurred at 950,000\r\nyears ago, the second or middle one at 850,000 years ago, and the\r\nthird and last at 750,000 years ago—the whole extending over a period\r\nof nearly 300,000 years. Passing onwards for another million and half\r\nyears, or to about 800,000 years in the future, we come to the third\r\ngreat period. It also consists of three maxima one hundred thousand\r\nyears apart. Those occur at the periods 800,000, 900,000, and 1,000,000\r\nyears to come, respectively, separated also by two minima. Those three\r\ngreat periods, two of them in the past and one of them in the future,\r\nincluded in the Table, are therefore separated from each other by an\r\ninterval of upwards of 1,700,000 years.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: PLATE IV\r\n\r\n  W. & A. K. Johnston, Edinb^r. and London.\r\n\r\n  DIAGRAM REPRESENTING THE VARIATIONS IN THE ECCENTRICITY OF THE\r\n  EARTH’S ORBIT FOR THREE MILLION OF YEARS BEFORE 1800 A.D. ONE\r\n  MILLION OF YEARS AFTER IT.\r\n\r\n  _The Ordinates are joined by straight lines where the values, at\r\n  intervals of 10,000 years, between them have not been determined._]\r\n\r\nIn this Table there are seven periods when the earth’s orbit becomes\r\nnearly circular, four in the past and three in the future.\r\n\r\nThe Table shows also four or five subordinate periods of high\r\neccentricity, the principal one occurring 200,000 years ago.\r\n\r\nThe variations of eccentricity during the four millions of years, are\r\nrepresented to the eye diagrammatically in Plate IV.\r\n\r\nIn order to determine with more accuracy the condition of the earth’s\r\norbit during the three periods of great eccentricity included in Table\r\nI., I computed the values for periods of ten thousand years apart, and\r\nthe results are embodied in Tables II., III., and IV.\r\n\r\nThere are still eminent astronomers and physicists who are of opinion\r\nthat the climate of the globe never could have been seriously affected\r\nby changes in the eccentricity of its orbit. This opinion results, no\r\ndoubt, from viewing the question as a purely astronomical one. Viewed\r\nfrom an astronomical standpoint, as has been already remarked, there\r\nis actually nothing from which any one could reasonably conclude with\r\ncertainty whether a change of eccentricity would seriously affect\r\nclimate or not. By means of astronomy we ascertain the extent of the\r\neccentricity at any given period, how much the winter may exceed\r\nthe summer in length (or the reverse), how much the sun’s heat is\r\nincreased or decreased by a decrease or an increase of distance,\r\nand so forth; but we obtain no information whatever regarding how\r\nthese will actually affect climate. This, as we have already seen,\r\nmust be determined wholly from physical considerations, and it is\r\nan exceedingly complicated problem. An astronomer, unless he has\r\ngiven special attention to the physics of the question, is just as\r\napt to come to a wrong conclusion as any one else. The question\r\ninvolves certain astronomical elements; but when these are determined\r\neverything then connected with the matter is purely physical. Nearly\r\nall the astronomical elements of the question are comprehended in the\r\naccompanying Tables.\r\n\r\n                               TABLE I.\r\n\r\n  THE ECCENTRICITY AND LONGITUDE OF THE

+---------+------------+-----------+-----------+---------+---------+-----------+-----------+\r\n\r\nIn Tables II., III., and IV., column I. represents the dates of the\r\nperiods, column II. the eccentricity, column III. the longitude of\r\nthe perihelion. In Table IV. the eccentricity and the longitude of\r\nthe perihelion of the six periods marked with an S are copied from a\r\nletter of Mr. Stone to Sir Charles Lyell, published in the Supplement\r\nof the Phil. Mag. for June, 1865; the eight periods marked L are copied\r\nfrom M. Leverrier’s Table, to which reference has been made. For the\r\ncorrectness of everything else, both in this Table and in the other\r\nthree, I alone am responsible.\r\n\r\nColumn IV. gives the number of degrees passed over by the perihelion\r\nduring each 10,000 years. From this column it will be seen how\r\nirregular is the motion of the perihelion. At four different periods\r\nit had a retrograde motion for 20,000 years. Column V. shows the\r\nnumber of days by which the winter exceeds the summer when the winter\r\noccurs in aphelion. Column VI. shows the intensity of the sun’s heat\r\nduring midwinter, when the winter occurs in aphelion, the present\r\nmidwinter intensity being taken at 1,000. These six columns comprehend\r\nall the astronomical part of the Tables. Regarding the correctness of\r\nthe principles upon which these columns are constructed, there is no\r\ndiversity of opinion. But these columns afford no direct information\r\nas to the character of the climate, or how much the temperature is\r\nincreased or diminished. To find this we pass on to columns VII. and\r\nVIII., calculated on physical principles. Now, unless the physical\r\nprinciples upon which these three columns are calculated be wholly\r\nerroneous, change of eccentricity must undoubtedly very seriously\r\naffect climate. Column VII. shows how many degrees Fahrenheit the\r\ntemperature is lowered by a decrease in the intensity of the sun’s heat\r\ncorresponding to column VI. For example, 850,000 years ago, if the\r\nwinters occurred then in aphelion, the direct heat of the sun during\r\nmidwinter would be only 837/1000 of what it is at present at the same\r\nseason of the year, and column VII. shows that this decrease in the\r\nintensity of the sun’s heat would lower the temperature 45°·3 F.\r\n\r\nThe principle upon which this result is arrived at is this:--The\r\ntemperature of space, as determined by Sir John Herschel, is −239°\r\nF. M. Pouillet, by a different method, arrived at almost the same\r\nresult. If we take the midwinter temperature of Great Britain at\r\n39°, then 239° + 39° = 278° will represent the number of degrees of\r\nrise due to the sun’s heat at midwinter; in other words, it takes a\r\nquantity of sun-heat which we have represented by 1000 to maintain the\r\ntemperature of the earth’s surface in Great Britain 278° above the\r\ntemperature of space. Were the sun extinguished, the temperature of\r\nour island would sink 278° below its present midwinter temperature,\r\nor to the temperature of space. But 850,000 years ago, as will be\r\nseen from Table III., if the winters occurred in aphelion, the heat\r\nof the sun at midwinter would only equal 837 instead of 1000 as at\r\npresent. Consequently, if it takes 1,000 parts of heat to maintain the\r\ntemperature 278° above the temperature of space, 837 parts of heat will\r\nonly be able to maintain the temperature 232°·7 above the temperature\r\nof space; for 232°·7 is to 278 as 837 is to 1,000. Therefore, if the\r\ntemperature was then only 232°·7 above that of space, it would be\r\n45°·3 below what it is at present. This is what the temperature would\r\nbe on the supposition, of course, that it depended wholly on the\r\nsun’s intensity and was not modified by other causes. This method has\r\nalready been discussed at some length in Chapter II. But whether these\r\nvalues be too high or too low, one thing is certain, that a very slight\r\nincrease or a very slight decrease in the quantity of heat received\r\nfrom the sun must affect temperature to a considerable extent. The\r\ndirect heat of the moon, for example, cannot be detected by the finest\r\ninstruments which we possess; yet from 238,000 observations made at\r\nPrague during 1840−66, it would seem that the temperature is sensibly\r\naffected by the mere change in the lunar perigee and inclination of the\r\nmoon’s orbit.[195]\r\n\r\nColumn VIII. gives the midwinter temperature. It is found by\r\nsubtracting the numbers in column VII. from 39°, the present midwinter\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\nI have not given a Table showing the temperature of the summers at\r\nthe corresponding periods. This could not well be done; for there is\r\nno relation at the periods in question between the intensity of the\r\nsun’s heat and the temperature of the summers. One is apt to suppose,\r\nwithout due consideration, that the summers ought to be then as much\r\nwarmer than they are at present, as the winters were then colder than\r\nnow. Sir Charles Lyell, in his “Principles,” has given a column of\r\nsummer temperatures calculated from my table upon this principle.\r\nAstronomically the principle is correct, but physically, as was shown\r\nin Chapter IV., it is totally erroneous, and calculated to convey a\r\nwrong impression regarding the whole subject of geological climate.\r\nThe summers at those periods, instead of being much warmer than they\r\nare at present, would in reality be much colder, notwithstanding the\r\ngreat increase in the intensity of the sun’s heat resulting from the\r\ndiminished distance of the sun.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, is the date of the glacial epoch? It is perfectly obvious\r\nthat if the glacial epoch resulted from a high state of eccentricity,\r\nit must be referred either to the period included in Table III. or\r\nto the one in Table IV. In Table III. we have a period extending from\r\nabout 980,000 to about 720,000 years ago, and in Table IV. we have a\r\nperiod beginning about 240,000 years ago, and extending down to about\r\n80,000 years ago. As the former period was of greater duration than\r\nthe latter, and the eccentricity also attained to a higher value, I at\r\nfirst felt disposed to refer the glacial epoch proper (the time of the\r\ntill and boulder clay) to the former period; and the latter period, I\r\nwas inclined to believe, must have corresponded to the time of local\r\nglaciers towards the close of the glacial epoch, the evidence for which\r\n(moraines) is to be found in almost every one of our Highland glens.\r\nOn this point I consulted several eminent geologists, and they all\r\nagreed in referring the glacial epoch to the former period; the reason\r\nassigned being that they considered the latter period to be much too\r\nrecent and of too short duration to represent that epoch.\r\n\r\nPondering over the subject during the early part of 1866, reasons soon\r\nsuggested themselves which convinced me that the glacial epoch must\r\nbe referred to the latter and not to the former period. Those reasons\r\nI shall now proceed to state at some length, since they have a direct\r\nbearing, as will be seen, on the whole question of geological time.\r\n\r\nIt is the modern and philosophic doctrine of uniformity that has\r\nchiefly led geologists to over-estimate the length of geological\r\nperiods. This philosophic school teaches, and that truly, that the\r\ngreat changes undergone by the earth’s crust must have been produced,\r\nnot by convulsions and cataclysms of nature, but by those ordinary\r\nagencies that we see at work every day around us, such as rain, snow,\r\nfrost, ice, and chemical action, &c. It teaches that the valleys\r\nwere not produced by violent dislocations, nor the hills by sudden\r\nupheavals, but that they were actually carved out of the solid rock\r\nby the silent and gentle agency of chemical action, frost, rain, ice,\r\nand running water. It teaches, in short, that the rocky face of our\r\nglobe has been carved into hill and dale, and ultimately worn down\r\nto the sea-level, by means of these apparently trifling agents, not\r\nonly once or twice, but probably dozens of times over during past\r\nages. Now, when we reflect that with such extreme slowness do these\r\nagents perform their work, that we might watch their operations from\r\nyear to year, and from century to century, if we could, without being\r\nable to perceive that they make any very sensible advance, we are\r\nnecessitated to conclude that geological periods must be enormous. And\r\nthe conclusion at which we thus arrive is undoubtedly correct. It is,\r\nin fact, impossible to form an adequate conception of the length of\r\ngeological time. It is something too vast to be fully grasped by our\r\nminds. But here we come to the point where the fundamental mistake\r\narises; Geologists do not err in forming too great a conception of the\r\nextent of geological periods, _but in the mode in which they represent\r\nthe length of these periods in numbers_. When we speak of units, tens,\r\nhundreds, thousands, we can form some notion of what these quantities\r\nrepresent; but when we come to millions, tens of millions, hundreds\r\nof millions, thousands of millions, the mind is then totally unable\r\nto follow, and we can only use these numbers as representations of\r\nquantities that turn up in calculation. We know, from the way in which\r\nthey do turn up in our process of calculation, whether they are correct\r\nrepresentations of things in actual nature or not; but we could not,\r\nfrom a mere comparison of these quantities with the thing represented\r\nby them, say whether they were actually too small or too great.\r\n\r\nAt present, geological estimates of time are little else than mere\r\nconjectures. Geological science has hitherto afforded no trustworthy\r\nmeans of estimating the positive length of geological epochs.\r\nGeological phenomena tell us most emphatically that these periods\r\nmust be long; but how long they have hitherto failed to inform us.\r\nGeological phenomena represent time to the mind under a most striking\r\nand imposing form. They present to the eye, as it were, a sensuous\r\nrepresentation of time; the mind thus becomes deeply impressed with\r\na sense of immense duration; and when one under these feelings is\r\ncalled upon to put down in figures what he believes will represent that\r\nduration, he is very apt to be deceived. If, for example, a million of\r\nyears as represented by geological phenomena and a million of years as\r\nrepresented by figures were placed before our eyes, we should certainly\r\nfeel startled. We should probably feel that a unit with six ciphers\r\nafter it was really something far more formidable than we had hitherto\r\nsupposed it to be. Could we stand upon the edge of a gorge a mile and\r\na half in depth that had been cut out of the solid rock by a tiny\r\nstream, scarcely visible at the bottom of this fearful abyss, and were\r\nwe informed that this little streamlet was able to wear off annually\r\nonly 1/10 of an inch from its rocky bed, what would our conceptions be\r\nof the prodigious length of time that this stream must have taken to\r\nexcavate the gorge? We should certainly feel startled when, on making\r\nthe necessary calculations, we found that the stream had performed this\r\nenormous amount of work in something less than a million of years.\r\n\r\nIf, for example, we could possibly form some adequate conception of a\r\nperiod so prodigious as one hundred millions of years, we should not\r\nthen feel so dissatisfied with Sir W. Thomson’s estimate that the age\r\nof the earth’s crust is not greater than that.\r\n\r\nHere is one way of conveying to the mind some idea of what a million\r\nof years really is. Take a narrow strip of paper an inch broad, or\r\nmore, and 83 feet 4 inches in length, and stretch it along the wall of\r\na large hall, or round the walls of an apartment somewhat over 20 feet\r\nsquare. Recall to memory the days of your boyhood, so as to get some\r\nadequate conception of what a period of a hundred years is. Then mark\r\noff from one of the ends of the strip 1/10 of an inch. The 1/10 of the\r\ninch will then represent one hundred years, and the entire length of\r\nthe strip a million of years. It is well worth making the experiment,\r\njust in order to feel the striking impression that it produces on the\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nThe latter period, which we have concluded to be that of the glacial\r\nepoch, extended, as we have seen, over a period of 160,000 years. But\r\nas the glaciation was only on one hemisphere at a time, 80,000 years\r\nor so would represent the united length of the cold periods. In order\r\nto satisfy ourselves that this period is sufficiently long to account\r\nfor all the amount of denudation effected during the glacial epoch,\r\nlet us make some rough estimate of the probable rate at which the\r\nsurface of the country would be ground down by the ice. Suppose the\r\nice to grind off only one-tenth of an inch annually this would give\r\nupwards of 650 feet as the quantity of rock removed during the time.\r\nBut it is probable that it did not amount to one-fourth part of that\r\nquantity. Whether one-tenth of an inch per annum be an over-estimate or\r\nan under-estimate of the rate of denudation by the ice, it is perfectly\r\nevident that the period in question is sufficiently long, so far as\r\ndenudation is concerned, to account for the phenomena of the glacial\r\nepoch.\r\n\r\nBut admitting that the period under consideration is sufficiently\r\n_long_ to account for all the denudation which took place _during_\r\nthe glacial epoch, we have yet to satisfy ourselves that it is also\r\nsufficiently _remote_ to account for all the denudation which has taken\r\nplace _since_ the glacial epoch. Are the facts of geology consistent\r\nwith the idea that the close of the glacial epoch does not date back\r\nbeyond 80,000 years?\r\n\r\nThis question could be answered if we knew the present rate of\r\nsubaërial denudation, for the present rate evidently does not differ\r\ngreatly from that which has obtained since the close of the glacial\r\nepoch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\n      GEOLOGICAL TIME.—METHOD OF MEASURING THE RATE OF SUBAËRIAL\r\n                              DENUDATION.\r\n\r\n  Rate of Subaërial Denudation a Measure of Time.—Rate determined\r\n      from Sediment of the Mississippi.—Amount of Sediment carried\r\n      down by the Mississippi; by the Ganges.—Professor Geikie on\r\n      Modern Denudation.—Professor Geikie on the Amount of Sediment\r\n      conveyed by European Rivers.—Rate at which the Surface of\r\n      the Globe is being denuded.—Alfred Tylor on the Sediment\r\n      of the Mississippi.—The Law which determines the Rate of\r\n      Denudation.—The Globe becoming less oblate.—Carrying Power\r\n      of our River Systems the true Measure of Denudation.—Marine\r\n      Denudation trifling in comparison to Subaërial.—Previous\r\n      Methods of measuring Geological Time.—Circumstances which\r\n      show the recent Date of the Glacial Epoch.—Professor Ramsay\r\n      on Geological Time.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is almost self-evident that the rate of subaërial denudation must\r\nbe equal to the rate at which the materials are carried off the land\r\ninto the sea, but the rate at which the materials are carried off the\r\nland is measured by the rate at which sediment is carried down by our\r\nriver systems. _Consequently, in order to determine the present rate\r\nof subaërial denudation, we have only to ascertain the quantity of\r\nsediment annually carried down by the river systems._\r\n\r\nKnowing the quantity of sediment transported by a river, say annually,\r\nand the area of its drainage, we have the means of determining the\r\nrate at which the surface of this area is being lowered by subaërial\r\ndenudation. And if we know this in reference to a few of the great\r\ncontinental rivers draining immense areas in various latitudes, we\r\ncould then ascertain with tolerable correctness the rate at which the\r\nsurface of the globe is being lowered by subaërial denudation, and\r\nalso the length of time which our present continents can remain above\r\nthe sea-level. Explaining this to Professor Ramsay during the winter\r\nof 1865, I learned from him that accurate measurements had been made\r\nof the amount of sediment annually carried down by the Mississippi\r\nRiver, full particulars of which investigations were to be found\r\nin the Proceedings of the American Association for the Advancement\r\nof Science for 1848. These proceedings contain a report by Messrs.\r\nBrown and Dickeson, which unfortunately over-estimated the amount of\r\nsediment transported by the Mississippi by nearly four times what\r\nwas afterwards found by Messrs. Humphreys and Abbot to be the actual\r\namount. From this estimate, I was led to the conclusion that if the\r\nMississippi is a fair representative of rivers in general, our existing\r\ncontinents would not remain longer than one million and a half years\r\nabove the sea-level.[196] This was a conclusion so startling as to\r\nexcite suspicion that there must have been some mistake in reference\r\nto Messrs. Brown and Dickeson’s data. It showed beyond doubt, however,\r\nthat the rate of subaërial denudation, when accurately determined by\r\nthis method, would be found to be enormously greater than had been\r\nsupposed. Shortly afterwards, on estimating the rate from the data\r\nfurnished by Humphreys and Abbot, I found the rate of denudation to\r\nbe about one foot in 6,000 years. Taking the mean elevation of all\r\nthe land as ascertained by Humboldt to be 1,000 feet, the whole would\r\ntherefore be carried down into the ocean by our river systems in about\r\n6,000,000 of years if no elevation of the land took place.[197] The\r\nfollowing are the data and mode of computation by which this conclusion\r\nwas arrived at. It was found by Messrs. Humphreys and Abbot that the\r\naverage amount of sediment held in suspension in the waters of the\r\nMississippi is about 1/1500 of the weight of the water, or 1/2900\r\nby bulk. The annual discharge of the river is 19,500,000,000,000\r\ncubic feet of water. The quantity of sediment carried down into the\r\nGulf of Mexico amounts to 6,724,000,000 cubic feet. But besides\r\nthat which is held in suspension, the river pushes down into the\r\nsea about 750,000,000 cubic feet of earthy matter, making in all a\r\ntotal of 7,474,000,000 cubic feet transferred from the land to the\r\nsea annually. Where does this enormous mass of material come from?\r\nUnquestionably it comes from the ground drained by the Mississippi. The\r\narea drained by the river is 1,244,000 square miles. Now 7,474,000,000\r\ncubic feet removed off 1,224,000 square miles of surface is equal to\r\n1/4566 of a foot off that surface per annum, or one foot in 4,566\r\nyears. The specific gravity of the sediment is taken at 1·9, that of\r\nrock is about 2·5; consequently the amount removed is equal to one foot\r\nof rock in about 6,000 years. The average height of the North American\r\ncontinent above the sea-level, according to Humboldt, is 748 feet;\r\nconsequently, at the present rate of denudation, the whole area of\r\ndrainage will be brought down to the sea-level in less than 4,500,000\r\nyears, if no elevation of the land takes place.\r\n\r\nReferring to the above, Sir Charles Lyell makes the following\r\nappropriate remarks:—“There seems no danger of our overrating the\r\nmean rate of waste by selecting the Mississippi as our example, for\r\nthat river drains a country equal to more than half the continent of\r\nEurope, extends through twenty degrees of latitude, and therefore\r\nthrough regions enjoying a great variety of climate, and some of its\r\ntributaries descend from mountains of great height. The Mississippi\r\nis also more likely to afford us a fair test of ordinary denudation,\r\nbecause, unlike the St. Lawrence and its tributaries, there are no\r\ngreat lakes in which the fluviatile sediment is thrown down and\r\narrested on its way to the sea.”[198]\r\n\r\nThe rate of denudation of the area drained by the river Ganges is much\r\ngreater than that of the Mississippi. The annual discharge of that\r\nriver is 6,523,000,000,000 cubic feet of water. The sediment held in\r\nsuspension is equal to 1/510 by weight; area of drainage 432,480 square\r\nmiles. This gives one foot of rock in 2,358 years as the amount removed.\r\n\r\nRough estimates have been made of the amount of sediment carried down\r\nby some eight or ten European rivers; and although those estimates\r\ncannot be depended upon as being anything like perfectly accurate,\r\nstill they show (what there is very little reason to doubt) that it is\r\nextremely probable that the European continent is being denuded about\r\nas rapidly as the American.\r\n\r\nFor a full account of all that is known on this subject I must\r\nrefer to Professor Geikie’s valuable memoir on Modern Denudation\r\n(Transactions of Geological Society of Glasgow, vol. iii.; also Jukes\r\nand Geikie’s “Manual of Geology,” chap. xxv.) It is mainly through the\r\ninstrumentality of this luminous and exhaustive memoir that the method\r\nunder consideration has gained such wide acceptance amongst geologists.\r\n\r\nProfessor Geikie finds that at the present rate of erosion the\r\nfollowing is the number of years required by the undermentioned rivers\r\nto remove one foot of rock from the general surface of their basins.\r\nProfessor Geikie thus shows that the rate of denudation, as determined\r\nfrom the amount of sediment carried down the Mississippi, is certainly\r\nnot too high.\r\n\r\n  Danube            6,846 years.\r\n  Mississippi       6,000   〃\r\n  Nith              4,723   〃\r\n  Ganges            2,358   〃\r\n  Rhone             1,528   〃\r\n  Hoang Ho          1,464   〃\r\n  Po                  729   〃\r\n\r\nBy means of subaërial agencies continents are being cut up into\r\nislands, the islands into smaller islands, and so on till the whole\r\nultimately disappears.\r\n\r\nNo proper estimate has been made of the quantity of sediment carried\r\ndown into the sea by our British rivers. But, from the principles just\r\nstated, we may infer that it must be as great in proportion to the area\r\nof drainage as that carried down by the Mississippi. For example, the\r\nriver Tay, which drains a great portion of the central Highlands of\r\nScotland, carries to the sea three times as much water in proportion\r\nto its area of drainage as is carried by the Mississippi. And any one\r\nwho has seen this rapidly running river during a flood, red and turbid\r\nwith sediment, will easily be convinced that the quantity of solid\r\nmaterial carried down by it into the German Ocean must be very great.\r\nMr. John Dougall has found that the waters of the Clyde during a flood\r\nhold in suspension 1/800 by bulk of sediment. The observations were\r\nmade about a mile above the city of Glasgow. But even supposing the\r\namount of sediment held in suspension by the waters of the Tay to be\r\nonly one-third (which is certainly an under-estimate) of that of the\r\nMississippi, viz. 1/4500 by weight, still this would give the rate of\r\ndenudation of the central Highlands at one foot in 6,000 years, or\r\n1,000 feet in 6 millions of years.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that although so many measurements have been made of\r\nthe amount of fluviatile sediment being transported seawards, yet that\r\nthe bearing which this has on the broad questions of geological time\r\nand the rate of subaërial denudation should have been overlooked. One\r\nreason for this, no doubt, is that the measurements were made, not\r\nwith a view to determine the rate at which the river basins are being\r\nlowered, but mainly to ascertain the age of the river deltas and the\r\nrate at which these are being formed.[199]\r\n\r\n_The Law which determines the Rate at which any Country is being\r\ndenuded._—By means of subaërial agencies continents are being cut up\r\ninto islands, the islands into smaller islands, and so on till the\r\nwhole ultimately disappears.\r\n\r\nSo long as the present order of things remains, the rate of denudation\r\nwill continue while land remains above the sea-level; and we have no\r\nwarrant for supposing that the rate was during past ages less than it\r\nis at the present day. It will not do to object that, as a considerable\r\namount of the sediment carried down by rivers is boulder clay and\r\nother materials belonging to the Ice age, the total amount removed\r\nby the rivers is on that account greater than it would otherwise be.\r\nWere this objection true, it would follow that, prior to the glacial\r\nperiod, when it is assumed that there was no boulder clay, the face of\r\nthe country must have consisted of bare rock; for in this case no soil\r\ncould have accumulated from the disintegration and decomposition of the\r\nrocks, _since, unless the rocks of a country disintegrate more rapidly\r\nthan the river systems are able to carry the disintegrated materials\r\nto the sea, no surface soil can form on that country_. The rate at\r\nwhich rivers carry down sediment is evidently not determined by the\r\nrate at which the rocks are disintegrated and decomposed, but by the\r\nquantity of rain falling, and the velocity with which it moves off the\r\nface of the country. Every river system possesses a definite amount of\r\ncarrying-power, depending upon the slope of the ground, the quantity of\r\nrain falling per annum, the manner in which the rain falls, whether it\r\nfalls gradually or in torrents, and a few other circumstances. When it\r\nso happens, as it generally does, that the amount of rock disintegrated\r\non the face of the country is greater than the carrying-power of the\r\nriver systems can remove, then a soil necessarily forms. But when the\r\nreverse is the case no soil can form on that country, and it will\r\npresent nothing but barren rock. This is no doubt the reason why in\r\nplaces like the Island of Skye, for example, where the rocks are\r\nexceedingly hard and difficult to decompose and separate, the ground\r\nsteep, and the quantity of rain falling very great, there is so much\r\nbare rock to be seen. If, prior to the glacial epoch, the rocks of\r\nthe area drained by the Mississippi did not produce annually more\r\nmaterial from their destruction under atmospheric agency than was being\r\ncarried down by that river, then it follows that the country must have\r\npresented nothing but bare rock, if the amount of rain falling then was\r\nas great as at present.\r\n\r\nBut, after all, one foot removed off the general level of the country\r\nsince the creation of man, according to Mosaic chronology, is certainly\r\nnot a very great quantity. No person but one who had some preconceived\r\nopinions to maintain, would ever think of concluding that one foot of\r\nsoil during 6,000 years was an extravagant quantity to be washed off\r\nthe face of the country by rain and floods during that long period.\r\nThose who reside in the country and are eye-witnesses of the actual\r\neffects of heavy rains upon the soil, our soft country roads, ditches,\r\nbrooks, and rivers, will have considerable difficulty in actually\r\nbelieving that only one foot has been washed away during the past 6,000\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nSome may probably admit that a foot of soil may be washed off during\r\na period so long as 6,000 years, and may tell us that what they deny\r\nis not that a foot of loose and soft soil, but a foot of solid rock\r\ncan be washed away during that period. But a moment’s reflection must\r\nconvince them that, unless the rocks of the country were disintegrating\r\nand decomposing as rapidly into soil as the rain is carrying the soil\r\naway, the surface of the country would ultimately become bare rock. It\r\nis true that the surface of our country in many places is protected by\r\na thick covering of boulder clay; but when this has once been removed,\r\nthe rocks will then disintegrate far more rapidly than they are doing\r\nat present.\r\n\r\nBut slow as is the rate at which the country is being denuded, yet\r\nwhen we take into consideration a period so enormous as 6 millions of\r\nyears, we find that the results of denudation are really startling.\r\nOne thousand feet of solid rock during that period would be removed\r\nfrom off the face of the country. But if the mean level of the country\r\nwould be lowered 1,000 feet in 6 millions of years, how much would our\r\nvalleys and glens be deepened during that period? This is a problem\r\nwell worthy of the consideration of those who treat with ridicule the\r\nidea that the general features of our country have been carved out by\r\nsubaërial agency.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the retardation of the earth’s rotation, occasioned\r\nby the friction of the tidal wave, the sea-level must be slowly sinking\r\nat the equator and rising at the poles. But it is probable that the\r\nland at the equator is being lowered by denudation as rapidly as\r\nthe sea-level is sinking. _Nearly one mile must have been worn off\r\nthe equator during the past 12 millions of years_, if the rate of\r\ndenudation all along the equator be equal to that of the basin of the\r\nGanges. It therefore follows that we cannot infer from the present\r\nshape of our globe what was its form, or the rate at which it was\r\nrotating, at the time when its crust became solidified. Although it\r\nhad been as oblate as the planet Jupiter, denudation must in time have\r\ngiven it its present form.\r\n\r\nThere is another effect which would result from the denudation of the\r\nequator and the sinking of the ocean at the equator and its rise at\r\nthe poles. This, namely, that it would tend to increase the rate of\r\nrotation; or, more properly, it would tend to _lessen_ the rate of\r\ntidal retardation.\r\n\r\nBut if the rate of denudation be at present so great, what must it have\r\nbeen during the glacial epoch? It must have been something enormous.\r\nAt present, denudation is greatly retarded by the limited power of\r\nour river systems to remove the loose materials resulting from the\r\ndestruction of the rocks. These materials accumulate and form a thick\r\nsoil over the surface of the rocks, which protects them, to a great\r\nextent, from the weathering effects of atmospheric agents. So long as\r\nthe amount of rock disintegrated exceeds that which is being removed\r\nby the river systems, the soil will continue to accumulate till the\r\namount of rock destroyed per annum is brought to equal that which\r\nis being removed. It therefore follows from this principle that the\r\nCARRYING-POWER OF OUR RIVER SYSTEMS IS THE TRUE MEASURE OF DENUDATION.\r\nBut during the glacial epoch the thickness of the soil would have but\r\nlittle effect in diminishing the waste of the rocks; for at that period\r\nthe rocks were not decomposed by atmospheric agency, but were ground\r\ndown by the mechanical friction of the ice. But the presence of a thick\r\nsoil at this period, instead of retarding the rate of denudation,\r\nwould tend to increase it tenfold, for the soil would then be used as\r\ngrinding-material for the ice-sheet. In places where the ice was, say,\r\n2,000 feet in thickness, the soil would be forced along over the rocky\r\nface of the country, exerting a pressure on the rocks equal to 50 tons\r\non the square foot.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the rate at which many kinds of rocks decompose and\r\ndisintegrate is far less than what has been concluded to be the mean\r\nrate of denudation of the whole country. This is evident from the fact\r\nwhich has been adduced by some writers, that inscriptions on stones\r\nwhich have been exposed to atmospheric agency for a period of 2,000\r\nyears or so, have not been obliterated. But in most cases epitaphs on\r\nmonuments and tombstones, and inscriptions on the walls of buildings,\r\n200 years old, can hardly be read. And this is not all: the stone on\r\nwhich the letters were cut has during that time rotted in probably to\r\nthe depth of several inches; and during the course of a few centuries\r\nmore the whole mass will crumble into dust.\r\n\r\nThe facts which we have been considering show also how trifling is the\r\namount of denudation effected by the sea in comparison with that by\r\nsubaërial agents. The entire sea-coast of the globe, according to Dr.\r\nA. Keith Johnston, is 116,531 miles. Suppose we take the average height\r\nof the coast-line at 25 feet, and take also the rate at which the sea\r\nis advancing on the land at one foot in 100 years, then this gives\r\n15,382,500,000 cubic feet of rock as the total amount removed in 100\r\nyears by the action of the sea. The total amount of land is 57,600,000\r\nsquare miles, or 1,605,750,000,000,000 square feet; and if one foot is\r\nremoved off the surface in 6,000 years, then 26,763,000,000,000 cubic\r\nfeet is removed by subaërial agency in 100 years, or about 1,740 times\r\nas much as that removed by the sea. Before the sea could denude the\r\nglobe as rapidly as the subaërial agents, it would have to advance on\r\nthe land at the rate of upwards of 17 feet annually.\r\n\r\nIt will not do, however, to measure marine denudation by the rate at\r\nwhich the sea is advancing on the land. There is no relation whatever\r\nbetween the rate at which the sea is _advancing_ on the land and the\r\nrate at which the sea is _denuding_ the land. For it is evident that as\r\nthe subaërial agents bring the coast down to the sea-level, all that\r\nthe sea has got to do is simply to advance, or at most to remove the\r\nloose materials which may lie in its path. The amount of denudation\r\nwhich has been effected by the sea during past geological ages,\r\ncompared with what has been effected by subaërial agency, is evidently\r\nbut trifling. Denudation is not the proper function of the sea. The\r\ngreat denuding agents are land-ice, frost, rain, running-water,\r\nchemical agency, &c. The proper work which belongs to the sea is the\r\ntransporting of the loose materials carried down by the rivers, and the\r\nspreading of these out so as to form the stratified beds of future ages.\r\n\r\n_Previous Methods of measuring Geological Time unreliable._—The method\r\nwhich has just been detailed of estimating the rate of subaërial\r\ndenudation seems to afford the only reliable means of a geological\r\ncharacter of determining geological time in absolute measure. The\r\nmethods which have hitherto been adopted not only fail to give the\r\npositive length of geological periods, but some of them are actually\r\ncalculated to mislead.\r\n\r\nThe common method of calculating the length of a period from the\r\nthickness of the stratified rocks belonging to that period is one of\r\nthat class. Nothing whatever can be inferred from the thickness of a\r\ndeposit as to the length of time which was required to form it. The\r\nthickness of a deposit will depend upon a great many circumstances,\r\nsuch as whether the deposition took place near to land or far away in\r\nthe deep recesses of the ocean, whether it occurred at the mouth of a\r\ngreat river or along the sea-shore, or at a time when the sea-bottom\r\nwas rising, subsiding, or remaining stationary. Stratified formations\r\n10,000 feet in thickness, for example, may, under some conditions, have\r\nbeen formed in as many years, while under other conditions it may have\r\nrequired as many centuries. Nothing whatever can be safely inferred as\r\nto the absolute length of a period from the thickness of the stratified\r\nformations belonging to that period. Neither will this method give us a\r\ntrustworthy estimate of the _relative_ lengths of geological periods.\r\nSuppose we find the average thickness of the Cambrian rocks to be,\r\nsay, 26,000 feet, the Silurian to be 28,000 feet, the Devonian to be\r\n6,000 feet, and the Tertiary to be 10,000 feet, it would not be safe\r\nto assume, as is sometimes done, that the relative duration of those\r\nperiods must have corresponded to these numbers. Were we sure that we\r\nhad got the correct average thickness of all the rocks belonging to\r\neach of those formations, we might probably be able to arrive at the\r\nrelative lengths of those periods; but we can never be sure of this.\r\nThose formations all, at one time, formed sea-bottoms; and we can only\r\nmeasure such deposits as are now raised above the sea-level. But is\r\nnot it probable that the relative positions of sea and land during the\r\nCambrian, Silurian, Old Red Sandstone, Carboniferous, and other early\r\nperiods of the earth’s history, differed more from the present than the\r\ndistribution of sea and land during the Tertiary period differed from\r\nthat which obtains now? May not the greater portion of the Tertiary\r\ndeposits be still under the sea-bottom? And if this be the case, it may\r\nyet be found at some day in the distant future, when these deposits\r\nare elevated into dry land, that they are much thicker than we now\r\nconclude them to be. Of course, it is by no means asserted that this\r\nis so, but only that they _may_ be thicker for anything we know to the\r\ncontrary; and the possibility that they may, destroys our confidence\r\nin the accuracy of this method of determining the relative lengths of\r\ngeological periods.\r\n\r\nNeither does palæontology afford any better mode of measuring\r\ngeological time. In fact, the palæontological method of estimating\r\ngeological time, either absolute or relative, from the rate at which\r\nspecies change, appears to be even still more unsatisfactory. If we\r\ncould ascertain by some means or other the time that has elapsed from\r\nsome given epoch (say, for example, the glacial) till the present\r\nday, and were we sure at the same time that species have changed at a\r\nuniform rate during all past ages, then, by ascertaining the percentage\r\nof change that has taken place since the glacial epoch, we should\r\nhave a means of making something like a rough estimate of the length\r\nof the various periods. But without some such period to start with,\r\nthe palæontological method is useless. It will not do to take the\r\nhistoric period as a base-line. It is far too short to be used with\r\nsafety in determining the distance of periods so remote as those which\r\nconcern the geologist. But even supposing the palæontologist had a\r\nperiod of sufficient length measured off correctly to begin with, his\r\nresults would still be unsatisfactory; for it is perfectly obvious,\r\nthat unless the climatic conditions of the globe during the various\r\nperiods were nearly the same, the rate at which the species change\r\nwould certainly not be uniform; but such has not been the case, as an\r\nexamination of the Tables of eccentricity will show. Take, for example,\r\nthat long epoch of 260,000 years, beginning about 980,000 years ago\r\nand terminating about 720,000 years ago. During that long period the\r\nchanges from cold to warm conditions of climate every 10,000 or 12,000\r\nyears must have been of the most extreme character. Compare that\r\nperiod with the period beginning, say, 80,000 years ago, and extending\r\nto nearly 150,000 years into the future, during which there will be\r\nno extreme variations of climate, and how great is the contrast! How\r\nextensive the changes in species must have been during the first period\r\nas compared with those which are likely to take place during the latter!\r\n\r\nBesides, it must also be taken into consideration that organization was\r\nof a far more simple type in the earlier Palæozoic ages than during the\r\nTertiary period, and would probably on this account change much more\r\nslowly in the former than in the latter.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing considerations render it highly probable, if not\r\ncertain, that the rate at which the general surface of the globe is\r\nbeing lowered by subaërial denudation cannot be much under one foot\r\nin 6,000 years. How, if we assign the glacial epoch to that period of\r\nhigh eccentricity beginning 980,000 years ago, and terminating 720,000\r\nyears ago, then we must conclude that as much as 120 feet must have\r\nbeen denuded off the face of the country since the close of the glacial\r\nepoch. But if as much as this had been carried down by our rivers into\r\nthe sea, hardly a patch of boulder clay, or any trace of the glacial\r\nepoch, should be now remaining on the land. It is therefore evident\r\nthat the glacial epoch cannot be assigned to that remote period, but\r\nought to be referred to the period terminating about 80,000 years ago.\r\nWe have, in this latter case, 13 feet, equal to about 18 feet of drift,\r\nas the amount removed from the general surface of the country since\r\nthe glacial epoch. This amount harmonizes very well with the direct\r\nevidence of geology on this point. Had the amount of denudation since\r\nthe close of the glacial epoch been much greater than this, the drift\r\ndeposits would not only have been far less complete, but the general\r\nappearance and outline of the surface of all glaciated countries would\r\nhave been very different from what they really are.\r\n\r\n_Circumstances which show the Recent Date of the Glacial Epoch._—One\r\nof the circumstances to which I refer is this. When we examine the\r\nsurface of any glaciated country, such as Scotland, we can easily\r\nsatisfy ourselves that the upper surface of the ground differs very\r\nmuch from what it would have been had its external features been due\r\nto the action of rain and rivers and the ordinary agencies which have\r\nbeen at work since the close of the Ice period. Go where one will in\r\nthe Lowlands of Scotland, and he shall hardly find a single acre whose\r\nupper surface bears the marks of being formed by the denuding agents\r\nwhich are presently in operation. He will observe everywhere mounds\r\nand hollows, the existence of which cannot be accounted for by the\r\npresent agencies at work. In fact these agencies are slowly denuding\r\npre-existing heights and silting up pre-existing hollows. Everywhere\r\none comes upon patches of alluvium which upon examination prove to be\r\nsimply old glacially formed hollows silted up. True, the main rivers,\r\nstreams, and even brooks, occupy channels which have been formed by\r\nrunning water, either since or prior to the glacial epoch, but, in\r\nregard to the general surface of the country, the present agencies may\r\nbe said to be just beginning to carve a new line of features out of\r\nthe old glacially formed surface. But so little progress has yet been\r\nmade, that the kames, gravel mounds, knolls of boulder clay, &c., still\r\nretain in most cases their original form. Now, when we reflect that\r\nmore than a foot of drift is being removed from the general surface of\r\nthe country every 5,000 years or so, it becomes perfectly obvious that\r\nthe close of the glacial epoch must be of comparatively recent date.\r\n\r\nThere is another circumstance which shows that the glacial epoch must\r\nbe referred to the latest period of great eccentricity. If we refer the\r\nglacial epoch to the penultimate period of extreme eccentricity, and\r\nplace its commencement one million of years back, then we must also\r\nlengthen out to a corresponding extent the entire geological history\r\nof the globe. Sir Charles Lyell, who is inclined to assign the glacial\r\nepoch to this penultimate period, considers that when we go back as far\r\nas the Lower Miocene formations, we arrive at a period when the marine\r\nshells differed as a whole from those now existing. But only 5 per\r\ncent. of the shells existing at the commencement of the glacial epoch\r\nhave since died out. Hence, assuming the rate at which the species\r\nchange to be uniform, it follows that the Lower Miocene period must\r\nbe twenty times as remote as the commencement of the glacial epoch.\r\nConsequently, if it be one million of years since the commencement\r\nof the glacial epoch, 20 millions of years, Sir Charles concludes,\r\nmust have elapsed since the time of the Lower Miocene period, and\r\n60 millions of years since the beginning of the Eocene period, and\r\nabout 160 millions of years since the Carboniferous period, and about\r\n240 millions of years must be the time which has elapsed since the\r\nbeginning of the Cambrian period. But, on the other hand, if we refer\r\nthe glacial epoch to the latest period of great eccentricity, and take\r\n250,000 years ago as the beginning of that period, then, according\r\nto the same mode of calculation, we have 15 millions of years since\r\nthe beginning of the Eocene period, and 40 millions of years since\r\nthe Carboniferous period, and 60 millions of years in all since the\r\nbeginning of the Cambrian period.\r\n\r\nIf the beginning of the glacial epoch be carried back a million years,\r\nthen it is probable, as Sir Charles Lyell concludes, that the beginning\r\nof the Cambrian period will require to be placed 240 millions of years\r\nback. But it is very probable that the length of time embraced by the\r\npre-Cambrian ages of geological history may be as great as that which\r\nhas elapsed since the close of the Cambrian period, and, if this be\r\nso, then we shall be compelled to admit that nearly 500 millions of\r\nyears have passed away since the beginning of the earth’s geological\r\nhistory. But we have evidence of a physical nature which proves that it\r\nis absolutely impossible that the existing order of things, as regards\r\nour globe, can date so far back as anything like 500 millions of years.\r\nThe arguments to which I refer are those which have been advanced by\r\nProfessor Sir William Thomson at various times. These arguments are\r\nwell known, and to all who have really given due attention to them must\r\nbe felt to be conclusive. It would be superfluous to state them here; I\r\nshall, however, for reasons which will presently appear, refer briefly\r\nto one of them, and that one which seems to be the most conclusive of\r\nall, viz., the argument derived from the limit to the age of the sun’s\r\nheat.\r\n\r\n_Professor Ramsay on Geological Time._—In an interesting suggestive\r\nmemoir, “On Geological Ages as items of Geological Time,”[200]\r\nProfessor Ramsay discusses the comparative values of certain groups of\r\nformations as representative of geological time, and arrives at the\r\nfollowing general conclusion, viz., “That the local continental era\r\nwhich began with the Old Red Sandstone and closed with the New Red Marl\r\nis comparable, in point of geological time, to that occupied in the\r\ndeposition of the whole of the Mesozoic, or Secondary series, later\r\nthan the New Red Marl and all the Cainozoic or Tertiary formations,\r\nand indeed of all the time that has elapsed since the beginning of\r\nthe deposition of the Lias down to the present day.” This conclusion\r\nis derived partly from a comparison of the physical character of\r\nthe formations constituting each group, but principally from the\r\nzoological changes which took place during the time represented by them.\r\n\r\nThe earlier period represented by the Cambrian and Silurian rocks he\r\nalso, from the same considerations, considers to have been very long,\r\nbut he does not attempt to fix its relative length. Of the absolute\r\nlength of any or all of these great eras of geological time no\r\nestimate or guess is given. He believes, however, that the whole time\r\nrepresented by all the fossiliferous rocks, from the earliest Cambrian\r\nto the most recent, is, geologically speaking, short compared with that\r\nwhich went before it. After quoting Professor Huxley’s enumeration of\r\nthe many classes and orders of marine life (identical with those still\r\nexisting), whose remains characterize the lowest Cambrian rocks, he\r\nsays, “The inference is obvious that in this earliest known varied\r\nlife we find no evidence of its having lived near the beginning of\r\nthe zoological series. In a broad sense, compared with what must have\r\ngone before, both biologically and physically, all the phenomena\r\nconnected with this old period seem to my mind to be quite of a recent\r\ndescription, and the climates of seas and lands were of the very same\r\nkind as those that the world enjoys at the present day.”... “In the\r\nwords of Darwin, when discussing the imperfection of the geological\r\nrecord of this history, ‘we possess the last volume alone relating\r\nonly to two or three countries,’ and the reason why we know so little\r\nof pre-Cambrian faunas and the physical characters of the more ancient\r\nformations as originally deposited, is that below the Cambrian strata\r\nwe get at once involved in a sort of chaos of metamorphic strata.’”\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that Professor Ramsay’s results lead to the same\r\nconclusion regarding the _positive_ length of geological periods as\r\nthose derived from physical considerations. It is true that his views\r\nlead us back to an immense lapse of unknown time prior to the Cambrian\r\nperiod, but this practically tends to shorten geological periods. For\r\nit is evident that the geological history of our globe must be limited\r\nby the age of the sun’s heat, no matter how long or short its age may\r\nbe. This being the case, the greater the length of time which must\r\nhave elapsed prior to the Cambrian period, the less must be the time\r\nwhich has elapsed since that period. Whatever is added to the one\r\nperiod must be so much taken from the other. Consequently, the longer\r\nwe suppose the pre-Cambrian periods to have been, the shorter must we\r\nsuppose the post-Cambrian to be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\n                THE PROBABLE AGE AND ORIGIN OF THE SUN.\r\n\r\n  Gravitation Theory.—Amount of Heat emitted by the Sun.—Meteoric\r\n      Theory.—Helmholtz’s Condensation Theory.—Confusion of\r\n      Ideas.—Gravitation not the chief Source of the Sun’s\r\n      Heat.—Original Heat.—Source of Original Heat.—Original Heat\r\n      derived from Motion in Space.—Conclusion as to Date of\r\n      Glacial Epoch.—False Analogy.—Probable Date of Eocene and\r\n      Miocene Periods.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Gravitation Theory of the Origin and Source of the Sun’s Heat._—There\r\nare two forms in which this theory has been presented: the first, the\r\nmeteoric theory, propounded by Dr. Meyer, of Heilbronn; and the second,\r\nthe contraction theory, advocated by Helmholtz.\r\n\r\nIt is found that 83·4 foot-pounds of heat per second are incident upon\r\na square foot of the earth’s surface exposed to the perpendicular rays\r\nof the sun. The amount radiated from a square foot of the sun’s surface\r\nis to that incident on a square foot of the earth’s surface as the\r\nsquare of the sun’s distance to the square of his radius, or as 46,400\r\nto 1. Consequently 3,869,000 foot-pounds of heat are radiated off every\r\nsquare foot of the sun’s surface per second—an amount equal to about\r\n7,000 horse power. The total amount radiated from the whole surface\r\nof the sun per annum is 8,340 × 10^{30} foot-pounds. To maintain the\r\npresent rate of radiation, it would require the combustion of about\r\n1,500 lbs. of coal per hour on every square foot of the sun’s surface;\r\nand were the sun composed of that material, it would be all consumed in\r\nless than 5,000 years. The opinion that the sun’s heat is maintained\r\nby combustion cannot be entertained for a single moment. A pound of\r\ncoal falling into the sun from an infinite distance would produce by\r\nits concussion more than 6,000 times the amount of heat that would be\r\ngenerated by its combustion.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that the velocity with which a body falling from an\r\ninfinite distance would reach the sun would be equal to that which\r\nwould be generated by a constant force equal to the weight of the body\r\nat the sun’s surface operating through a space equal to the sun’s\r\nradius. One pound would at the sun’s surface weigh about 28 pounds.\r\nTaking the sun’s radius at 441,000 miles,[201] the energy of a pound\r\nof matter falling into the sun from infinite space would equal that\r\nof a 28-pound weight descending upon the earth from an elevation of\r\n441,000 miles, supposing the force of gravity to be as great at that\r\nelevation as it is at the earth’s surface. It would amount to upwards\r\nof 65,000,000,000 foot-pounds. A better idea of this enormous amount\r\nof energy exerted by a one-pound weight falling into the sun will be\r\nconveyed by stating that it would be sufficient to raise 1,000 tons to\r\na height of 5½ miles. It would project the _Warrior_, fully equipped\r\nwith guns, stores, and ammunition, over the top of Ben Nevis.\r\n\r\nGravitation is now generally admitted to be the only conceivable\r\nsource of the sun’s heat. But if we attribute the energy of the sun to\r\ngravitation as a source, we assign it to a cause the value of which can\r\nbe accurately determined. Prodigious as is the energy of a single pound\r\nof matter falling into the sun, nevertheless a range of mountains,\r\nconsisting of 176 cubic miles of solid rock, falling into the sun,\r\nwould maintain his heat for only a single second. A mass equal to that\r\nof the earth would maintain the heat for only 93 years, and a mass\r\nequal to that of the sun itself falling into the sun would afford but\r\n33,000,000 years’ sun-heat.\r\n\r\nIt is quite possible, however, that a meteor may reach the sun with a\r\nvelocity far greater than that which it could acquire by gravitation;\r\nfor it might have been moving in a direct line towards the sun with\r\nan original velocity before coming under the sensible influence of\r\nthe sun’s attraction. In this case a greater amount of heat would\r\nbe generated by the meteor than would have resulted from its merely\r\nfalling into the sun under the influence of gravitation. But then\r\nmeteors of this sort must be of rare occurrence. The meteoric theory\r\nof the sun’s heat has now been pretty generally abandoned for the\r\ncontraction theory advanced by Helmholtz.\r\n\r\nSuppose, with Helmholtz, that the sun originally existed as a nebulous\r\nmass, filling the entire space presently occupied by the solar system\r\nand extending into space indefinitely beyond the outermost planet. The\r\ntotal amount of work in foot-pounds performed by gravitation in the\r\ncondensation of this mass to an orb of the sun’s present size can be\r\nfound by means of the following formula given by Helmholtz,[202]\r\n\r\n                         3   _r_^{2}M^{2}\r\n  Work of condensation = — × ———————————— × _g_\r\n                         5       R_m_\r\n\r\nM is the mass of the sun, _m_ the mass of the earth, R the sun’s\r\nradius, and _r_ the earth’s radius. Taking M = 4230 × 10^{27} lbs.,\r\n_m_ = 11,920 × 10^{21} lbs., R = 2,328,500,000 feet, and _r_ =\r\n20,889,272 feet; we have then for the total amount of work performed by\r\ngravitation in foot-pounds,\r\n\r\n         3   (20,889,272·5)^2 × (4230 × 10^{27})^2\r\n  Work = — × —————————————————————————————————————\r\n         5     2,328,500,000 × 11,920 × 10^{21}\r\n\r\n  = 168,790 × 10^{36} foot-pounds.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe amount of heat thus produced by gravitation would suffice for\r\nnearly 20,237,500 years.\r\n\r\nThese calculations are based upon the assumption that the density of\r\nthe sun is uniform throughout. But it is highly probable that the sun’s\r\ndensity increases towards the centre, in which case the amount of work\r\nperformed by gravitation would be somewhat more than the above.\r\n\r\nSome confusion has arisen in reference to this subject by the\r\nintroduction of the question of the amount of the sun’s specific heat.\r\nIf we simply consider the sun as an incandescent body in the process\r\nof cooling, the question of the amount of the sun’s specific heat is\r\nof the utmost importance; because the absolute amount of heat which\r\nthe sun is capable of giving out depends wholly upon his temperature\r\nand specific heat. In this case three things only are required: (1),\r\nthe sun’s mass; (2), temperature of the mass; (3), specific heat of\r\nthe mass. But if we are considering what is the absolute amount of\r\nheat which could have been given out by the sun on the hypothesis that\r\ngravitation, either according to the meteoric theory suggested by Meyer\r\nor according to the contraction theory advocated by Helmholtz, is the\r\nonly source of his heat, then we have nothing whatever to do with any\r\ninquiries regarding the specific heat of the sun. This is evident\r\nbecause the absolute amount of work which gravitation can perform in\r\nthe pulling of the particles of the sun’s mass together, is wholly\r\nindependent of the specific heat of those particles. Consequently, the\r\namount of energy in the form of heat thus imparted to the particles\r\nby gravity must also be wholly independent of specific heat. That is\r\nto say, the amount of heat imparted to a particle will be the same\r\nwhatever may be its specific heat.\r\n\r\nEven supposing we limit the geological history of our globe to 100\r\nmillions of years, it is nevertheless evident that gravitation will not\r\naccount for the supply of the sun’s heat during so long a period. There\r\nmust be some other source of much more importance than gravitation.\r\nWhat other source of energy greater than that of gravitation can there\r\nbe? It is singular that the opinion should have become so common even\r\namong physicists, that there is no other conceivable source than\r\ngravitation from which a greater amount of heat could have been derived.\r\n\r\n_The Origin and Chief Source of the Sun’s Heat._—According to the\r\nforegoing theories regarding the source of the sun’s heat, it is\r\nassumed that the matter composing the sun, when it existed in space as\r\na nebulous mass, was not originally possessed of temperature, but that\r\nthe temperature was given to it as the mass became condensed under the\r\nforce of gravitation. It is supposed that the heat given out was simply\r\nthe heat of condensation. But it is quite conceivable that the nebulous\r\nmass might have been possessed of an original store of heat previous to\r\ncondensation.\r\n\r\nIt is quite possible that the very reason why it existed in such a\r\nrarefied or gaseous condition was its excessive temperature, and that\r\ncondensation only began to take place when the mass began to cool down.\r\nIt seems far more probable that this should have been the case than\r\nthat the mass existed in so rarefied a condition without temperature.\r\nFor why should the particles have existed in this separated form when\r\ndevoid of the repulsive energy of heat, seeing that in virtue of\r\ngravitation they had such a tendency to approach to one another? But\r\nif the mass was originally in a heated condition, then in condensing\r\nit would have to part not only with the heat generated in condensing,\r\nbut also with the heat which it originally possessed, a quantity\r\nwhich would no doubt much exceed that produced by condensation. To\r\nillustrate this principle, let us suppose a pound of air, for example,\r\nto be placed in a cylinder and heat applied to it. If the piston be so\r\nfixed that it cannot move, 234·5 foot-pounds of heat will raise the\r\ntemperature of the air 1° C. But if the piston be allowed to rise as\r\nthe heat is applied, then it will require 330·2 foot-pounds of heat to\r\nraise the temperature 1° C. It requires 95·7 foot-pounds more heat in\r\nthe latter case than in the former. The same amount of energy, viz.,\r\n234·5 foot-pounds, in both cases goes to produce temperature; but in\r\nthe latter case, where the piston is allowed to move, 95·7 foot-pounds\r\nof additional heat are consumed in the mechanical work of raising the\r\npiston. Suppose, now, that the air is allowed to cool under the same\r\nconditions: in the one case 234·5 foot-pounds of heat will be given\r\nout while the temperature of the air sinks 1° C.; in the other case,\r\nwhere the piston is allowed to descend, 330·2 foot-pounds will be given\r\nout while the temperature sinks 1° C. In the former case, the air in\r\ncooling has simply to part with the energy which it possesses in\r\nthe form of temperature; but in the latter case it has, in addition\r\nto this, to part with the energy bestowed upon its molecules by the\r\ndescending piston. While the temperature of the gas is sinking 1°,\r\n95·7 foot-pounds of energy in the form of heat are being imparted to\r\nit by the descending piston; and these have to be got rid of before\r\nthe temperature is lowered by 1°. Consequently 234·5 foot-pounds of\r\nthe heat given out previously existed in the air under the form of\r\ntemperature, and the remaining 95·7 foot-pounds given out were imparted\r\nto the air by the descending piston while the gas was losing its\r\ntemperature. 234·5 foot-pounds represent the energy or heat which the\r\nair previously possessed, and 95·7 the energy or heat of condensation.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the cooling of the sun from a nebulous mass, there\r\nwould of course be no external force or pressure exerted on the mass\r\nanalogous to that of the piston on the air; but there would be, what\r\nis equivalent to the same, the gravitation of the particles to each\r\nother. There would be the pressure of the whole mass towards the centre\r\nof convergence. In the case of air, and all perfect gases cooling\r\nunder pressure, about 234 foot-pounds of the original heat possessed\r\nby the gas are given out while 95 foot-pounds are being generated by\r\ncondensation. We have, however, no reason whatever to believe that in\r\nthe case of the cooling of the sun the same proportions would hold\r\ntrue. The proportion of original heat possessed by the mass of the sun\r\nto that produced by condensation may have been much greater than 234 to\r\n95, or it may have been much less. In the absence of all knowledge on\r\nthis point, we may in the meantime assume that to be the proportion.\r\nThe total quantity of heat given out by the sun resulting from the\r\ncondensation of his mass, on the supposition that the density of the\r\nsun is uniform throughout, we have seen to be equal to 20,237,500\r\nyears’ sun-heat. Then the quantity of heat given out, which previously\r\nexisted in the mass as original temperature, must have been 49,850,000\r\nyears’ heat, making in all 70,087,500 years’ heat as the total amount.\r\n\r\nThe above quantity represents, of course, the total amount of heat\r\ngiven out by the mass since it began to condense. But the geological\r\nhistory of our globe must date its beginning at a period posterior to\r\nthat. For at that time the mass would probably occupy a much greater\r\namount of space than is presently possessed by the entire solar system;\r\nand consequently, before it had cooled down to within the limits of\r\nthe earth’s present orbit, our earth could not have had an existence\r\nas a separate planet. Previously to that time it must have existed as\r\na portion of the sun’s fiery mass. If we assume that it existed as a\r\nglobe previously to that, and came in from space after the condensation\r\nof the sun, then it is difficult to conceive how its orbit should be so\r\nnearly circular as it is at present.\r\n\r\nLet us assume that by the time that the mass of the sun had condensed\r\nto within the space encircled by the orbit of the planet Mercury (that\r\nis, to a sphere having, say, a radius of 18,000,000 miles) the earth’s\r\ncrust began to form; and let this be the time when the geological\r\nhistory of our globe dates its commencement. The total amount of heat\r\ngenerated by the condensation of the sun’s mass from a sphere of this\r\nsize to its present volume would equal 19,740,000 years’ sun-heat.\r\nThe amount of original heat given out during that time would equal\r\n48,625,000 years’ sun-heat,—thus giving a total of 68,365,000 years’\r\nsun-heat enjoyed by our globe since that period. The total quantity may\r\npossibly, of course, be considerably more than that, owing to the fact\r\nthat the sun’s density may increase greatly towards his centre. But we\r\nshould require to make extravagant assumptions regarding the interior\r\ndensity of the sun and the proportion of original heat to that produced\r\nby condensation before we could manage to account for anything like the\r\nperiod that geological phenomena are supposed by some to demand.\r\n\r\nThe question now arises, by what conceivable means could the mass of\r\nthe sun have become possessed of such a prodigious amount of energy\r\nin the form of heat previous to condensation? What power could have\r\ncommunicated to the mass 50,000,000 years’ heat before condensation\r\nbegan to take place?\r\n\r\n_The Sun’s Energy may have originally been derived from Motion in\r\nSpace._—There is nothing at all absurd or improbable in the supposition\r\nthat such an amount of energy might have been communicated to the\r\nmass. The Dynamical Theory of Heat affords an easy explanation of at\r\nleast _how_ such an amount of energy _may_ have been communicated. Two\r\nbodies, each one-half the mass of the sun, moving directly towards\r\neach other with a velocity of 476 miles per second, would by their\r\nconcussion generate in a _single moment_ the 50,000,000 years’ heat.\r\nFor two bodies of that mass moving with a velocity of 476 miles per\r\nsecond would possess 4149 × 10^{38} foot-pounds of energy in the form\r\nof _vis viva_; and this, converted into heat by the stoppage of their\r\nmotion, would give an amount of heat which would cover the present rate\r\nof the sun’s radiation, for a period of 50,000,000 years.\r\n\r\nWhy may not the sun have been composed of two such bodies? And why may\r\nnot the original store of heat possessed by him have all been derived\r\nfrom the concussion of these two bodies? Two such bodies coming into\r\ncollision with that velocity would be dissipated into vapour by such\r\nan inconceivable amount of heat as would thus be generated; and when\r\nthey condensed on cooling, they would form one spherical mass like the\r\nsun. It is perfectly true that two such bodies could never attain the\r\nrequired amount of velocity by their mutual gravitation towards each\r\nother. But there is no necessity whatever for supposing that their\r\nvelocities were derived from their mutual attraction alone. They might\r\nhave been approaching towards each other with the required velocity\r\nwholly independent of gravitation.\r\n\r\nWe know nothing whatever regarding the absolute motion of bodies in\r\nspace. And beyond the limited sphere of our observation, we know\r\nnothing even of their relative motions. There may be bodies moving\r\nin relation to our system with inconceivable velocity. For anything\r\nthat we know to the contrary, were one of these bodies to strike our\r\nearth, the shock might be sufficient to generate an amount of heat that\r\nwould dissipate the earth into vapour, though the striking body might\r\nnot be heavier than a cannon-ball. There is, however, nothing very\r\nextraordinary in the velocity which we have found would be required\r\nin the two supposed bodies to generate the 50,000,000 years’ heat. A\r\ncomet, having an orbit extending to the path of the planet Neptune,\r\napproaching so near the sun as to almost graze his surface in passing,\r\nwould have a velocity of about 390 miles per second, which is within 86\r\nmiles of the required velocity.\r\n\r\nBut in the original heating and expansion of the sun into a gaseous\r\nmass, an amount of work must have been performed against gravitation\r\nequal to that which has been performed by gravitation during his\r\ncooling and condensation, a quantity which we have found amounts to\r\nabout 20,000,000 years’ heat. The total amount of energy originally\r\ncommunicated by the concussion must have been equal to 70,000,000\r\nyears’ sun-heat. A velocity of 563 miles per second would give this\r\namount. It must be borne in mind, however, that the 563 miles per\r\nsecond is the velocity at the moment of collision; about one-half of\r\nthis velocity would be derived from the mutual attraction of the two\r\nbodies in their approach to each other. Suppose each body to be equal\r\nin volume to the sun, and of course one-half the density, the amount\r\nof velocity which they would acquire by their mutual attraction would\r\nbe 274 miles per second, consequently we have to assume an original or\r\nprojected velocity of only 289 miles per second.\r\n\r\nIf we admit that gravitation is not sufficient to account for the\r\namount of heat given out by the sun during the geological history of\r\nour globe, we are compelled to assume that the mass of which the sun is\r\ncomposed existed prior to condensation in a heated condition; and if\r\nso, we are further obliged to admit that the mass must have received\r\nits heat from some source or other. And as the dissipation of heat into\r\nspace must have been going on, in all probability, as rapidly before\r\nas after condensation took place, we are further obliged to conclude\r\nthat the heat must have been communicated to the mass immediately\r\nbefore condensation began, for the moment the mass began to lose its\r\nheat condensation would ensue. If we confine our speculations to causes\r\nand agencies known to exist, the cause which has been assigned appears\r\nto be the only conceivable one that will account for the production of\r\nsuch an enormous amount of heat.\r\n\r\nThe general conclusion to which we are therefore led from physical\r\nconsiderations regarding the age of the sun’s heat is, that the entire\r\ngeological history of our globe must be comprised within less than\r\n100 millions of years, and that consequently the commencement of the\r\nglacial epoch cannot date much farther back than 240,000 years.\r\n\r\nThe facts of geology, more especially those in connection with\r\ndenudation, seem to geologists to require a period of much longer\r\nduration than 100 millions of years, and it is this which has so\r\nlong prevented them accepting the conclusions of physical science in\r\nregard to the age of our globe. But the method of measuring subaërial\r\ndenudation already detailed seems to me to show convincingly that the\r\ngeological data, when properly interpreted, are in perfect accord with\r\nthe deductions of physical science. Perhaps there are now few who\r\nhave fairly considered the question who will refuse to admit that 100\r\nmillions of years are amply sufficient to comprise the whole geological\r\nhistory of our globe.\r\n\r\n_A false Analogy supposed to exist between Astronomy and\r\nGeology._—Perhaps one of the things which has tended to mislead on\r\nthis point is a false analogy which is supposed to subsist between\r\nastronomy and geology, viz., that geology deals with unlimited _time_,\r\nas astronomy deals with unlimited _space_. A little consideration,\r\nhowever, will show that there is not much analogy between the two cases.\r\n\r\nAstronomy deals with the countless worlds which lie spread out in the\r\nboundless infinity of space; but geology deals with only one world.\r\nNo doubt reason and analogy both favour the idea that the age of the\r\nmaterial universe, like its magnitude, is immeasurable; we have no\r\nreason, however, to conclude that it is eternal, any more than we\r\nhave to infer that it is infinite. But when we compare the age of the\r\nmaterial universe with its magnitude, we must not take the age of one\r\nof its members (say, our globe) and compare it with the size of the\r\nuniverse. Neither must we compare the age of all the presently existing\r\nsystems of worlds with the magnitude of the universe; but we must\r\ncompare the past history of the universe as it stretches back into the\r\nimmensity of bygone _time_, with the presently existing universe as it\r\nstretches out on all sides into limitless _space_. For worlds precede\r\nworlds in time as worlds lie beyond worlds in space. Each world,\r\neach individual, each atom is evidently working out a final purpose,\r\naccording to a plan prearranged and predetermined by the Divine Mind\r\nfrom all eternity. And each world, like each individual, when it\r\nserves the end for which it was called into existence, disappears to\r\nmake room for others. This is the grand conception of the universe\r\nwhich naturally impresses itself on every thoughtful mind that has not\r\ngot into confusion about those things called in science the Laws of\r\nNature.[203]\r\n\r\nBut the geologist does not pass back from world to world as they stand\r\nrelated to each other in the order of _succession in time_, as the\r\nastronomer passes from world to world as they stand related to each\r\nother in the order of _coexistence in space_. The researches of the\r\ngeologist, moreover, are not only confined to one world, but it is only\r\na portion of the history of that one world that can come under his\r\nobservation. The oldest of existing formations, so far as is yet known,\r\nthe Laurentian Gneiss, is made up of the waste of previously existing\r\nrocks, and it, again, has probably been derived from the degradation\r\nof rocks belonging to some still older period. Regarding what succeeds\r\nthese old Laurentian rocks geology tells us much; but of the formations\r\nthat preceded, we know nothing whatever. For anything that geology\r\nshows to the contrary, the time which may have elapsed from the\r\nsolidifying of the earth’s crust to the deposition of the Laurentian\r\nstrata—an absolute blank—may have been as great as the time that has\r\nsince intervened.\r\n\r\n_Probable Date of the Eocene and Miocene Periods._—If we take into\r\nconsideration the limit which physical science assigns to the age of\r\nour globe, and the rapid rate at which, as we have seen, denudation\r\ntakes place, it becomes evident that the enormous period of 3 millions\r\nof years comprehended in the foregoing tables must stretch far back\r\ninto the Tertiary age. Supposing that the mean rate of denudation\r\nduring that period was not greater than the present rate of denudation,\r\nstill we should have no less than 500 feet of rock worn off the face of\r\nthe country and carried into the sea during these 3 millions of years.\r\nThis fact shows how totally different the appearance and configuration\r\nof the country in all probability was at the commencement of this\r\nperiod from what it is at the present day. If it be correct that the\r\nglacial epoch resulted from the causes which we have already discussed,\r\nthose tables ought to aid us in our endeavour to ascertain _how_ much\r\nof the Tertiary period may be comprehended within these 3 millions of\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen (Chapter XVIII.) that there is evidence of a\r\nglacial condition of climate at two different periods during the\r\nTertiary age, namely, about the middle of the Miocene and Eocene\r\nperiods respectively. As has already been shown, the more severe a\r\nglacial epoch is, the more marked ought to be the character of its warm\r\ninter-glacial periods; the greater the extension of the ice during the\r\ncold periods of a glacial epoch the further should that ice disappear\r\nin arctic regions during the corresponding warm periods. Thus the\r\nseverity of a glacial epoch may in this case be indirectly inferred\r\nfrom the character of the warm periods and the extent to which the\r\nice may have disappeared from arctic regions. Judged by this test, we\r\nhave every reason to believe that the Miocene glacial epoch was one of\r\nextreme severity.\r\n\r\nThe Eocene conglomerate, devoid of all organic remains, and containing\r\nnumerous enormous ice-transported blocks, is, as we have seen,\r\nimmediately associated with nummulitic strata charged with fossils\r\ncharacteristic of a warm climate. Referring to this Sir Charles Lyell\r\nsays, “To imagine icebergs carrying such huge fragments of stone in so\r\nsouthern a latitude, and at a period immediately preceded and followed\r\nby the signs of a warm climate, is one of the most perplexing enigmas\r\nwhich the geologist has yet been called upon to solve.”[204]\r\n\r\nIt is perfectly true that, according to the generally received theories\r\nof the cause of a glacial climate the whole is a perplexing enigma, but\r\nif we adopt the Secular theory of change of climate, every difficulty\r\ndisappears. According to this theory the very fact of the conglomerate\r\nbeing formed at a period immediately preceded and succeeded by warm\r\nconditions of climate, is of itself strong presumptive evidence of the\r\nconglomerate being a glacial formation. But this is not all, the very\r\nhighness of the temperature of the preceding and succeeding periods\r\nbears testimony to the severity of the intervening glacial period.\r\nDespite the deficiency of direct evidence regarding the character of\r\nthe Miocene and Eocene glacial periods, we are not warranted, for\r\nreasons which have been stated in Chapter XVII., to conclude that these\r\nperiods were less severe than the one which happened in Quaternary\r\ntimes. Judging from indirect evidence, we have some grounds for\r\nconcluding that the Miocene glacial epoch at least was even more severe\r\nand protracted than our recent glacial epoch.\r\n\r\nBy referring to Table I., or the accompanying diagram, it will be seen\r\nthat prior to the period which I have assigned as that of the glacial\r\nepoch, there are two periods when the eccentricity almost attained\r\nits superior limit. The first period occurred 2,500,000 years ago,\r\nwhen it reached 0·0721, and the second period 850,000 years ago, when\r\nit attained a still higher value, viz., 0·0747, being within 0·0028\r\nof the superior limit. To the first of these periods I am disposed\r\nto assign the glacial epoch of Eocene times, and to the second that\r\nof the Miocene age. With the view of determining the character of\r\nthese periods Tables II. and III. have been computed. They give the\r\neccentricity and longitude of perihelion at intervals of 10,000 years.\r\nIt will be seen from Table II. that the Eocene period extends from\r\nabout 2,620,000 to about 2,460,000 years ago; and from Table III. it\r\nwill be gathered that the Miocene period lasted from about 980,000 to\r\nabout 720,000 years ago.\r\n\r\nIn order to find whether the eccentricity attained a higher value about\r\n850,000 years ago than 0·0747, I computed the values for one or two\r\nperiods immediately before and after that period, and satisfied myself\r\nthat the value stated was indeed the highest, as will be seen from the\r\nsubjoined table:—\r\n\r\n  851,000   0·07454\r\n  850,000   0·074664\r\n  849,500   0·07466\r\n  849,000   0·07466\r\n\r\nHow totally different must have been the condition of the earth’s\r\nclimate at that period from what it is at present! Taking the mean\r\ndistance of the sun to be 91,400,000 miles, his present distance at\r\nmidwinter is 89,864,480 miles; but at the period in question, when the\r\nwinter solstice was in perihelion, his distance at midwinter would be\r\nno less than 98,224,289 miles. But this is not all; our winters are at\r\npresent shorter than our summers by 7·8 days, but at that period they\r\nwould be longer than the summers by 34·7 days.\r\n\r\nAt present the difference between the perihelion and aphelion distance\r\nof the sun amounts to only 3,069,580 miles, but at the period under\r\nconsideration it would amount to no less than 13,648,579 miles!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\n     A METHOD OF DETERMINING THE MEAN THICKNESS OF THE SEDIMENTARY\r\n                          ROCKS OF THE GLOBE.\r\n\r\n  Prevailing Methods defective.—Maximum Thickness of British\r\n      Rocks.—Three Elements in the Question.—Professor Huxley\r\n      on the Rate of Deposition.—Thickness of Sedimentary Rocks\r\n      enormously over-estimated.—Observed Thickness no Measure of\r\n      mean Thickness.—Deposition of Sediment principally along\r\n      Sea-margin.—Mistaken Inference regarding the Absence of a\r\n      Formation.—Immense Antiquity of existing Oceans.\r\n\r\n\r\nVarious attempts have been made to measure the positive length of\r\ngeological periods. Some geologists have sought to determine, roughly,\r\nthe age of the stratified rocks by calculations based upon their\r\nprobable thickness and the rate at which they may have been deposited.\r\nThis method, however, is worthless, because the rates which have been\r\nadopted are purely arbitrary. One geologist will take the rate of\r\ndeposit at a foot in a hundred years, while another will assume it\r\nto be a foot in a thousand or perhaps ten thousand years; and, for\r\nany reasons that have been assigned, the one rate is just as likely\r\nto be correct as the other: for if we examine what is taking place\r\nin the ocean-bed at the present day, we shall find in some places a\r\nfoot of sediment laid down in a year, while in other places a foot\r\nmay not be deposited in a thousand years. The stratified rocks were\r\nevidently formed at all possible rates. When we speak of the rate of\r\ntheir formation, we must of course refer to the _mean rate_; and it is\r\nperfectly true that if we knew the thickness of these rocks and the\r\nmean rate at which they were deposited, we should have a ready means\r\nof determining their positive age. But there appears to be nearly as\r\ngreat uncertainty regarding the thickness of the sedimentary rocks as\r\nregarding the rate at which they were formed. No doubt we can roughly\r\nestimate their probable maximum thickness; for instance, Professor\r\nRamsay has found from actual measurement, that the sedimentary\r\nformations of Great Britain have a maximum thickness of upwards of\r\n72,000 feet; but all such measurements give us no idea of their mean\r\nthickness. What is the mean thickness of the sedimentary rocks of\r\nthe globe? On this point geology does not afford a definite answer.\r\nWhatever the present mean thickness of the sedimentary rocks of our\r\nglobe may be, it must be small in comparison to the mean thickness\r\nof all the sedimentary rocks which have been formed. This is obvious\r\nfrom the fact that the sedimentary rocks of one age are partly formed\r\nfrom the destruction of the sedimentary rocks of former ages. From the\r\nLaurentian age down to the present day, the stratified rocks have been\r\nundergoing constant denudation.\r\n\r\nUnless we take into consideration the quantity of rock removed during\r\npast ages by denudation, we cannot—even though we knew the actual mean\r\nthickness of the existing sedimentary rocks of the globe, and the rate\r\nat which they were formed—arrive at an estimate regarding the length of\r\ntime represented by these rocks. For if we are to determine the age of\r\nthe stratified rocks from the rate at which they were formed, we must\r\nhave, not the present quantity of sedimentary rocks, but the present\r\nplus the quantity which has been denuded during past ages. In other\r\nwords, we must have the absolute quantity formed. In many places the\r\nmissing beds must have been of enormous thickness. The time represented\r\nby beds which have disappeared is, doubtless, as already remarked,\r\nmuch greater than that represented by the beds which now remain. The\r\ngreater mass of the sedimentary rocks has been formed out of previously\r\nexisting sedimentary rocks, and these again out of sedimentary rocks\r\nstill older. As the materials composing our stratified beds may have\r\npassed through many cycles of destruction and re-formation, the time\r\nrequired to have deposited at a given rate the present existing mass\r\nof sedimentary rocks may be but a fraction of the time required to\r\nhave deposited at the same rate the total mass that has actually been\r\nformed. To measure the age of the sedimentary rocks by the present\r\nexisting rocks, assumed to be formed at some given rate, even supposing\r\nthe rate to be correct, is a method wholly fallacious.\r\n\r\n“The aggregate of sedimentary strata in the earth’s crust,” says Sir\r\nCharles Lyell, “can never exceed in volume the amount of solid matter\r\nwhich has been ground down and washed away by rivers, waves, and\r\ncurrents. How vast, then, must be the spaces which this abstraction\r\nof matter has left vacant! How far exceeding in dimensions all the\r\nvalleys, however numerous, and the hollows, however vast, which we can\r\nprove to have been cleared out by aqueous erosion!”[205]\r\n\r\nI presume there are few geologists who would not admit that if all the\r\nrocks which have in past ages been removed by denudation were restored,\r\nthe mean thickness of the sedimentary rocks of the globe would be at\r\nleast equal to their present maximum thickness, which we may take at\r\n72,000 feet.\r\n\r\nThere are three elements in the question; of which if two are known,\r\nthe third is known in terms of the other two. If we have the mean\r\nthickness of all the sedimentary rocks which have been formed and the\r\nmean rate of formation, then we have the time which elapsed during the\r\nformation; or having the thickness and the time, we have the rate; or,\r\nhaving the rate and the time, we have the thickness.\r\n\r\nOne of these three, namely, the rate, can, however, be determined with\r\ntolerable accuracy if we are simply allowed to assume—what is very\r\nprobable, as has already been shown—that the present rate at which the\r\nsedimentary deposits are being formed may be taken as the mean rate\r\nfor past ages. If we know the rate at which the land is being denuded,\r\nthen we know with perfect accuracy the rate at which the sedimentary\r\ndeposits are being formed in the ocean. This is obvious, because all\r\nthe materials denuded from the land are deposited in the sea; and\r\nwhat is deposited in the sea is just what comes off the land, with the\r\nexception of the small proportion of calcareous matter which may not\r\nhave been derived from the land, and which in our rough estimate may be\r\nleft out of account.\r\n\r\nNow the mean rate of subaërial denudation, we have seen, is about one\r\nfoot in 6,000 years. Taking the proportion of land to that of water\r\nat 576 to 1,390, then one foot taken off the land and spread over the\r\nsea-bottom would form a layer 5 inches thick. Consequently, if one foot\r\nin 6,000 years represents the mean rate at which the land is being\r\ndenuded, one foot in 14,400 years represents the mean rate at which the\r\nsedimentary rocks are being formed.\r\n\r\nAssuming, as before, that 72,000 feet would represent the mean\r\nthickness of all the sedimentary rocks which have ever been formed,\r\nthis, at the rate of one foot in 14,400 years, gives 1,036,800,000\r\nyears as the age of the stratified rocks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Huxley, in his endeavour to show that 100,000,000 years is\r\na period sufficiently long for all the demands of geologists, takes\r\nthe thickness of the stratified rocks at 100,000 feet, and the rate\r\nof deposit at a foot in 1,000 years. One foot of rock per 1,000 years\r\ngives, it is true, 100,000 feet in 100,000,000 years. But what about\r\nthe rocks which have disappeared? If it takes a hundred millions of\r\nyears to produce a mass of rock equal to that which now exists, how\r\nmany hundreds of millions of years will it require to produce a mass\r\nequal to what has actually been produced?\r\n\r\nProfessor Huxley adds, “I do not know that any one is prepared to\r\nmaintain that the stratified rocks may not have been formed on the\r\naverage at the rate of 1/83rd of an inch per annum.” When the rate,\r\nhowever, is accurately determined, it is found to be, not 1/83rd of\r\nan inch per annum, but only 1/1200th of an inch, so that the 100,000\r\nfeet of rock must have taken 1,440,000,000 years in its formation,—a\r\nconclusion which, according to the results of modern physics, is wholly\r\ninadmissible.\r\n\r\nEither the thickness of the sedimentary rocks has been over-estimated,\r\nor the rate of their formation has been under-estimated, or both.\r\nIf it be maintained that a foot in 14,400 years is too slow a rate\r\nof deposit, then it must be maintained that the land must have been\r\ndenuded at a greater rate than one foot in 6,000 years. But most\r\ngeologists probably felt surprised when the announcement was first\r\nmade, that at this rate of denudation the whole existing land of the\r\nglobe would be brought under the ocean in 6,000,000 of years.\r\n\r\nThe error, no doubt, consists in over-estimating the thickness of the\r\nsedimentary rocks. Assuming, for physical reasons already stated, that\r\n100,000,000 years limits the age of the stratified rocks, and that the\r\nproportion of land to water and the rate of denudation have been on the\r\naverage the same as at present, the mean thickness of sedimentary rocks\r\nformed in the 100,000,000 years amounts to only 7,000 feet.\r\n\r\nBut be it observed that this is the mean thickness on an area equal\r\nto that of the ocean. Over the area of the globe it amounts to only\r\n5,000 feet; and this, let it be observed also, is the total mean\r\nthickness formed, without taking into account what has been removed\r\nby denudation. If we wish to ascertain what is actually the present\r\nmean thickness, we must deduct from this 5,000 feet an amount of rock\r\nequal to all the sedimentary rocks which have been denuded during\r\nthe 100,000,000 years; for the 5,000 feet is not the present mean\r\nthickness, but the total mean thickness formed during the whole of the\r\n100,000,000 years. If we assume, what no doubt most geologists would be\r\nwilling to grant, that the quantity of sedimentary rocks now remaining\r\nis not over one-half of what has been actually deposited during the\r\nhistory of the globe, then the actual mean thickness of the stratified\r\nrocks of the globe is not over 2,500 feet. This startling result would\r\nalmost necessitate us to suspect that the rate of subaërial denudation\r\nis probably greater than one foot in 6,000 years. But, be this as it\r\nmay, we are apt, in estimating the mean thickness of the stratified\r\nrocks of the globe from their ascertained maximum thickness, to arrive\r\nat erroneous conclusions. There are considerations which show that\r\nthe mean thickness of these rocks must be small in proportion to their\r\nmaximum thickness. The stratified rocks are formed from the sediment\r\ncarried down by rivers and streamlets and deposited in the sea. It is\r\nobvious that the greater quantity of this sediment is deposited near\r\nthe mouths of rivers, and along a narrow margin extending to no great\r\ndistance from the land. Did the land consist of numerous small islands\r\nequally distributed over the globe, the sediment carried off from these\r\nislands would be spread pretty equally over the sea-bottom. But the\r\ngreater part of the land-surface consists of two immense continents.\r\nConsequently, the materials removed by denudation are not spread\r\nover the ocean-bottom, but on a narrow fringe surrounding those two\r\ncontinents. Were the materials spread over the entire ocean-bed, a foot\r\nremoved off the general surface of the land would form a layer of rock\r\nonly five inches thick. But in the way in which the materials are at\r\npresent deposited, the foot removed from the land would form a layer\r\nof rock many feet in thickness. The greater part of the sediment is\r\ndeposited within a few miles of the shore.\r\n\r\nThe entire coast-line of the globe is about 116,500 miles. I should\r\nthink that the quantity of sediment deposited beyond, say, 100 miles\r\nfrom this coast-line is not very great. No doubt several of the large\r\nrivers carry sediment to a much greater distance from their mouths than\r\n100 miles, and ocean currents may in some cases carry mud and other\r\nmaterials also to great distances. But it must be borne in mind that\r\nat many places within the 100 miles of this immense coast-line little\r\nor no sediment is deposited, so that the actual area over which the\r\nsediment carried off the land is deposited is probably not greater than\r\nthe area of this belt—116,500 miles long and 100 miles broad. This\r\narea on which the sediment is deposited, on the above supposition, is\r\ntherefore equal to about 11,650,000 square miles. The amount of land on\r\nthe globe is about 57,600,000 square miles. Consequently, one foot of\r\nrock, denuded from the surface of the land and deposited on this belt,\r\nwould make a stratum of rock 5 feet in thickness; but were the sediment\r\nspread over the entire bed of the ocean, it would form, as has already\r\nbeen stated, a stratum of rock of only 5 inches in thickness.\r\n\r\nSuppose that no subsidence of the land should take place for a period\r\nof, say, 3,000,000 of years. During that period 500 feet would be\r\nremoved by denudation, on an average, off the land. This would make a\r\nformation 2,500 feet thick, which some future geologist might call the\r\nPost-tertiary formation. But this, be it observed, would be only the\r\nmean thickness of the formation on this area; its maximum thickness\r\nwould evidently be much greater, perhaps twice, thrice, or even four\r\ntimes that thickness. A geologist in the future, measuring the actual\r\nthickness of the formation, might find it in some places 10,000 feet\r\nin thickness, or perhaps far more. But had the materials been spread\r\nover the entire ocean-bed, the formation would have a mean thickness\r\nof little more than 200 feet; and spread over the entire surface of\r\nthe globe, would form a stratum of scarcely 150 feet in thickness.\r\nTherefore, in estimating the mean thickness of the stratified rocks of\r\nthe globe, a formation with a maximum thickness of 10,000 feet may not\r\nrepresent more than 150 feet. A formation with a _mean_ thickness of\r\n10,000 feet represents only 600 feet.\r\n\r\nIt may be objected that in taking the present rate at which the\r\nsedimentary deposits are being formed as the mean rate for all ages,\r\nwe probably under-estimate the total amount of rock formed, because\r\nduring the many glacial periods which must have occurred in past ages\r\nthe amount of materials ground off the rocky surface of the land in a\r\ngiven period would be far greater than at present. But, in reply, it\r\nmust be remembered that although the destruction in ice-covered regions\r\nwould be greater during these periods than at present, yet the quantity\r\nof materials carried down by rivers into the sea would be less. At\r\nthe present day the greater part of the materials carried down by our\r\nrivers is not what is being removed off the rocky face of the country,\r\nbut the boulder clay, sand, and other materials which were ground off\r\nduring the glacial epoch. It is therefore possible, on this account,\r\nthat the rate of deposit may have been less during the glacial epoch\r\nthan at present.\r\n\r\nWhen any particular formation is wanting in a given area, the inference\r\ngenerally drawn is, that either the formation has been denuded off\r\nthe area, or the area was a land-surface during the period when that\r\nformation was being deposited. From the foregoing it will be seen that\r\nthis inference is not legitimate; for, supposing that the area had been\r\nunder water, the chances that materials should have been deposited on\r\nthat area are far less than are the chances that there should not.\r\nThere are sixteen chances against one that no formation ever existed in\r\nthe area.\r\n\r\nIf the great depressions of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans\r\nbe, for example, as old as the beginning of the Laurentian period—and\r\nthey may be so for anything which geology can show to the contrary—then\r\nunder these oceans little or no stratified rocks may exist. The\r\nsupposition that the great ocean basins are of immense antiquity, and\r\nthat consequently only a small proportion of the sedimentary strata\r\ncan possibly occupy the deeper bed of the sea, acquires still more\r\nprobability when we consider the great extent and thickness of the\r\nOld Red Sandstone, the Permian, and other deposits, which, according\r\nto Professor Ramsay and others, have been accumulated in vast inland\r\nlakes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\n    THE PHYSICAL CAUSE OF THE SUBMERGENCE AND EMERGENCE OF THE LAND\r\n                       DURING THE GLACIAL EPOCH.\r\n\r\n  Displacement of the Earth’s Centre of Gravity by Polar\r\n      Ice-cap.—Simple Method of estimating Amount of\r\n      Displacement.—Note by Sir W.

Let us assume, what is actually the\r\ncase, that the equatorial diameter of the globe is somewhat greater\r\nthan the polar, but that when the ice-cap is placed on one hemisphere\r\nthe whole forms a perfect sphere.\r\n\r\nI shall begin with a period of glaciation on the southern hemisphere.\r\nLet W N E S′ (Fig. 5) be the solid part of the earth, and _c_ its\r\ncentre of gravity. And let E S W be an ice-cap covering the southern\r\nhemisphere. Let us in the first case assume the earth to be of the same\r\ndensity as the cap. The earth with its cap forms now a perfect sphere\r\nwith its centre of gravity at _o_; for W N E S is a circle, and _o_\r\nis its centre. Suppose now the whole to be covered with an ocean a few\r\nmiles deep, the ocean will assume the spherical form, and will be of\r\nuniform depth. Let the southern winter solstice begin now to move round\r\nfrom the aphelion. The ice-cap will also commence gradually to diminish\r\nin thickness, and another cap will begin to make its appearance on\r\nthe northern hemisphere. As the northern cap may be supposed, for\r\nsimplicity of calculation, to increase at the same rate that the\r\nsouthern will diminish, the spherical form of the earth will always be\r\nmaintained. By the time that the northern cap has reached a maximum,\r\nthe southern cap will have completely disappeared. The circle W N′ E S′\r\nwill now represent the earth with its cap on the northern hemisphere,\r\nand _o′_ will be its centre of gravity; for _o′_ is the centre of the\r\ncircle W N′ E S′. And as the distance between the centres _o_ and\r\n_o′_ is equal to N N′, the thickness of the cap at the pole N N′ will\r\ntherefore represent the extent to which the centre of gravity has been\r\ndisplaced. It will also represent the extent to which the ocean has\r\nrisen at the north pole and sunk at the south. This is evident; for as\r\nthe sphere W N′ E S′ is the same in all respects as the sphere W N E\r\nS, with the exception only that the cap is on the opposite side, the\r\nsurface of the ocean at the poles will now be at the same distance from\r\nthe centre _o′_ as it was from the centre _o_ when the cap covered\r\nthe southern hemisphere. Hence the distance between _o_ and _o′_ must\r\nbe equal to the extent of the submergence at the north pole and the\r\nemergence at the south. Neglect the attraction of the altering water on\r\nthe water itself, which later on will come under our consideration.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 5.]\r\n\r\nWe shall now consider the result when the earth is taken at its actual\r\ndensity, which is generally believed to be about 5·5. The density\r\nof ice being ·92, the density of the cap to that of the earth will\r\ntherefore be as 1 to 6.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 6.]\r\n\r\nLet Fig. 6 represent the earth with an ice-cap on the northern\r\nhemisphere, whose thickness is, say, 6,000 feet at the pole. The centre\r\nof gravity of the earth without the cap is at _c_. When the cap is on,\r\nthe centre of gravity is shifted to _o_, a point a little more than\r\n500 feet to the north of _c_. Had the cap and the earth been of equal\r\ndensity, the centre of gravity would have been shifted to _o′_ the\r\ncentre of the figure, a point situated, of course, 3,000 feet to the\r\nnorth of _c_. Now it is very approximately true that the ocean will\r\ntend to adjust itself as a sphere around the centre of gravity, _o_.\r\nThus it would of course sink at the south pole and rise to the same\r\nextent at the north, in any opening or channel in the ice allowing the\r\nwater to enter.\r\n\r\nLet the ice-cap be now transferred over to the southern hemisphere,\r\nand the condition of things on the two hemispheres will in every\r\nparticular be reversed. The centre of gravity will then lie to\r\nthe south of _c_, or about 1,000 feet from its former position.\r\nConsequently the transference of the cap from the one hemisphere to the\r\nother will produce a total submergence of about 1,000 feet.\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, absurd to suppose that an ice-cap could ever actually\r\nreach down to the equator. It is probable that the great ice-cap of the\r\nglacial epoch nowhere reached even halfway to the equator. Our cap must\r\ntherefore terminate at a moderately high latitude. Let it terminate\r\nsomewhere about the latitude of the north of England, say at latitude\r\n55°. All that we have to do now is simply to imagine our cap, up to\r\nthat latitude, becoming converted into the fluid state. This would\r\nreduce the cap to less than one-half its former mass. But it would not\r\ndiminish the submergence to anything like that extent. For although the\r\ncap would be reduced to less than one-half its former mass, yet its\r\ninfluence in displacing the centre of gravity would not be diminished\r\nto that extent. This is evident; for the cap now extending down to\r\nonly latitude 55°, has its centre of gravity much farther removed from\r\nthe earth’s centre of gravity than it had when it extended down to the\r\nequator. Consequently it now possesses, in proportion to its mass, a\r\nmuch greater power in displacing the earth’s centre of gravity.\r\n\r\nThere is another fact which must be taken into account. The common\r\ncentre of gravity of the earth and cap is not exactly the point\r\naround which the ocean tends to adjust itself. It adjusts itself not\r\nin relation to the centre of gravity of the solid mass alone, but in\r\nrelation to the common centre of gravity of the entire mass, solid and\r\nliquid. Now the water which is pulled over from the one hemisphere to\r\nthe other by the attraction of the cap will also aid in displacing the\r\ncentre of gravity. It will co-operate with the cap and carry the true\r\ncentre of gravity to a point beyond that of the centre of gravity of\r\nthe earth and cap, and thus increase the effect.\r\n\r\nIt is of course perfectly true that when the ice-cap does not extend\r\ndown to the equator, as in the latter supposition, and is of less\r\ndensity than the globe, the ocean will not adjust itself uniformly\r\naround the centre of gravity; but the deviation from perfect uniformity\r\nis so trifling, as will be seen from the appended note of Sir William\r\nThomson, that for all practical purposes it may be entirely left out of\r\naccount.\r\n\r\nIn the _Reader_ for January 13, 1866, I advanced an objection to the\r\nsubmergence theory on the grounds that the lowering of the ocean-level\r\nby the evaporation of the water to form the ice-cap, would exceed the\r\nsubmergence resulting from the displacement of the earth’s centre of\r\ngravity. But, after my letter had gone to press, I found that I had\r\noverlooked some important considerations which seem to prove that the\r\nobjection had no real foundation. For during a glacial period, say\r\non the northern hemisphere, the entire mass of ice which presently\r\nexists on the southern hemisphere would be transferred to the northern,\r\nleaving the quantity of liquid water to a great extent unchanged.\r\n\r\n\r\n        _Note on the preceding by Sir William Thomson, F.R.S._\r\n\r\n“Mr. Croll’s estimate of the influence of a cap of ice on the sea-level\r\nis very remarkable in its relation to Laplace’s celebrated analysis,\r\nas being founded on that law of thickness which leads to expressions\r\ninvolving only the first term of the series of ‘Laplace’s functions,’\r\nor ‘spherical harmonics.’ The equation of the level surface, as\r\naltered by any given transference of solid matter, is expressed by\r\nequating the altered potential function to a constant. This function,\r\nwhen expanded in the series of spherical harmonics, has for its first\r\nterm the potential due to the whole mass supposed collected at its\r\naltered centre of gravity. Hence a spherical surface round the altered\r\ncentre of gravity is the _first_ approximation in Laplace’s method of\r\nsolution for the altered level surface. Mr. Croll has with admirable\r\ntact chosen, of all the arbitrary suppositions that may be made\r\nfoundations for rough estimates of the change of sea-level due to\r\nvariations in the polar ice-crusts, _the_ one which reduces to zero all\r\nterms after the first in the harmonic series, and renders that first\r\napproximation (which always expresses the _essence_ of the result) the\r\nwhole solution, undisturbed by terms irrelevant to the great physical\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Croll, in the preceding paper, has alluded with remarkable\r\nclearness to the effect of the change in the distribution of the\r\nwater in increasing, by its own attraction, the deviation of the\r\nlevel surface above that which is due to the _given_ change in the\r\ndistribution of solid matter. The remark he makes, that it is round\r\nthe centre of gravity of the altered solid and altered liquid that\r\nthe altering liquid surface adjusts itself, expresses the essence of\r\nLaplace’s celebrated demonstration of the stability of the ocean, and\r\nsuggests the proper elementary solution of the problem to find the\r\ntrue alteration of sea-level produced by a given alteration of the\r\nsolid. As an assumption leading to a simple calculation, let us suppose\r\nthe solid earth to rise out of the water in a vast number of small\r\nflat-topped islands, each bounded by a perpendicular cliff, and let the\r\nproportion of water area to the whole be equal in all quarters. Let all\r\nof these islands in one hemisphere be covered with ice, of thickness\r\naccording to the law assumed by Mr. Croll—that is, varying in simple\r\nproportion of the sine of the latitude. Let this ice be removed from\r\nthe first hemisphere and similarly distributed over the islands of\r\nthe second. By working out according to Mr. Croll’s directions, it is\r\neasily found that the change of sea-level which this will produce will\r\nconsist in a sinking in the first hemisphere and rising in the second,\r\nthrough heights varying according to the same law (that is, simple\r\nproportionality to sines of latitudes), and amounting at each pole to\r\n\r\n  (1 - ω)it\r\n  —————————,\r\n   1 - ωw\r\n\r\nwhere _t_ denotes the thickness of the ice-crust at the pole; _i_ the\r\nratio of the density of ice, and _w_ that of sea-water to the earth’s\r\nmean density; and ω the ratio of the area of ocean to the whole surface.\r\n\r\n“Thus, for instance, if we suppose ω = ⅔, and _t_ = 6,000 feet, and\r\ntake ⅙ and 1/(5½) as the densities of ice and water respectively, we\r\nfind for the rise of sea-level at one pole, and depression at the other,\r\n\r\n  ⅓ × ⅙ × 6000\r\n  ————————————,\r\n       2   1\r\n   1 - — × —\r\n       3   5½\r\n\r\nor approximately 380 feet.\r\n\r\n“I shall now proceed to consider roughly what is the probable extent\r\nof submergence which, during the glacial epoch, may have resulted from\r\nthe displacement of the earth’s centre of gravity by means of the\r\ntransferrence of the polar ice from the one hemisphere to the other.”\r\n\r\n_Difference between Continental-ice and a Glacier._—An ordinary\r\nglacier descends in virtue of the slope of its bed, and, as a general\r\nrule, it is on this account thin at its commencement, and thickens\r\nas it descends into the lower valleys, where the slope is less and\r\nthe resistance to motion greater. But in the case of continental ice\r\nmatters are entirely different. The slope of the ground exercises\r\nlittle or no influence on the motion of the ice. In a continent of one\r\nor two thousand miles across, the general slope of the ground may be\r\nleft out of account; for any slight elevation which the centre of such\r\na continent may have will not compensate for the resistance offered to\r\nthe flow of the ice by mountain ridges, hills, and other irregularities\r\nof its surface. The ice can move off such a surface only in consequence\r\nof pressure acting from the interior. In order to produce such a\r\npressure, there must be a piling up of the ice in the interior; or, in\r\nother words, the ice-sheet must thicken from the edge inwards to the\r\ncentre. We are necessarily led to the same conclusion, though we should\r\nnot admit that the ice moves in consequence of pressure from behind,\r\nbut should hold, on the contrary, that each particle of ice moves by\r\ngravity in virtue of its own weight; for in order to have such a motion\r\nthere must be a slope, and as the slope is not on the ground, it must\r\nbe on the ice itself: consequently we must conclude that the upper\r\nsurface of the ice slopes upwards from the edge to the interior. What,\r\nthen, is the least slope at which the ice will descend? Mr. Hopkins\r\nfound that ice barely moves on a slope of one degree. We have therefore\r\nsome data for arriving at least at a rough estimate of the probable\r\nthickness of an ice-sheet covering a continent, such, for example, as\r\nGreenland or the Antarctic Continent.\r\n\r\n_Probable Thickness of the Antarctic Ice-cap._—The antarctic continent\r\nis generally believed to extend, on an average, from the South Pole\r\ndown to about, at least, lat. 70°. In round numbers, we may take the\r\ndiameter of this continent at 2,800 miles. The distance from the\r\nedge of this ice-cap to its centre, the South Pole, will, therefore,\r\nbe 1,400 miles. The whole of this continent, like Greenland, is\r\nundoubtedly covered with one continuous sheet of ice gradually\r\nthickening inwards from its edge to its centre. A slope of one degree\r\ncontinued for 1,400 miles will give twenty-four miles as the thickness\r\nof the ice at the pole. But suppose the slope of the upper surface\r\nof the cap to be only one-half this amount, viz., a half degree,—and\r\nwe have no evidence that a slope so small would be sufficient to\r\ndischarge the ice,—still we have twelve miles as the thickness of the\r\ncap at the pole. To those who have not been accustomed to reflect on\r\nthe physical conditions of the problem, this estimate may doubtless\r\nbe regarded as somewhat extravagant; but a slight consideration\r\nwill show that it would be even more extravagant to assume that a\r\nslope of less than half a degree would be sufficient to produce the\r\nnecessary outflow of the ice. In estimating the thickness of a sheet of\r\ncontinental ice of one or two thousand miles across, our imagination\r\nis apt to deceive us. We can easily form a pretty accurate sensuous\r\nrepresentation of the thickness of the sheet; but we can form no\r\nadequate representation of its superficial area. We can represent\r\nto the mind with tolerable accuracy a thickness of a few miles, but\r\nwe cannot do this in reference to the area of a surface 2,800 miles\r\nacross. Consequently, in judging what proportion the thickness of the\r\nsheet should bear to its superficial area, we are apt to fall into the\r\nerror of under-estimating the thickness. We have a striking example\r\nof this in regard to the ocean. The thing which impresses us most\r\nforcibly in regard to the ocean is its profound depth. A mean depth\r\nof, say, three miles produces a striking impression; but if we could\r\nrepresent to the mind the vast area of the ocean as correctly as we can\r\ndo its depth, _shallowness_ rather than _depth_ would be the impression\r\nproduced. A sheet of water 100 yards in diameter, and only one inch\r\ndeep, would not be called a _deep_ but a very _shallow_ pool or thin\r\nlayer of water. But such a layer would be a correct representation of\r\nthe ocean in miniature. Were we in like manner to represent to the eye\r\nin miniature the antarctic ice-cap, we would call it a _thin crust of\r\nice_. Taking the mean thickness of the ice at four miles, the antarctic\r\nice-sheet would be represented by a carpet covering the floor of an\r\nordinary-sized dining-room. Were those who consider the above estimate\r\nof the thickness of the antarctic ice-cap as extravagantly great called\r\nupon to sketch on paper a section of what they should deem a cap of\r\nmoderate thickness, ninety-nine out of every hundred would draw one of\r\nmuch greater thickness than twelve miles at the centre.\r\n\r\nThe diagram on following page (Fig. 7) represents a section across the\r\ncap drawn to a natural scale; the upper surface of the sheet having\r\na slope of half a degree. No one on looking at the section would\r\npronounce it to be too thick at the centre, unless he were previously\r\nmade aware that it represented a thickness of twelve miles at that\r\nplace. It may be here mentioned that had the section been drawn upon\r\na much larger scale—had it, for instance, been made seven feet long,\r\ninstead of seven inches—it would have shown to the eye in a more\r\nstriking manner the thinness of the cap.\r\n\r\nBut to avoid all objections on the score of over-estimating the\r\nthickness of the cap, I shall assume the angle of the upper surface to\r\nbe only a quarter of a degree, and the thickness of the sheet one-half\r\nwhat it is represented in the section. The thickness at the pole will\r\nthen be only six miles instead of twelve, and the mean thickness of the\r\ncap two instead of four miles.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 7.\r\n\r\n  Section across Antarctic Ice-cap, drawn to a natural scale.\r\n\r\n  Length represented by section = 2,800 miles. Thickness at centre\r\n  (South Pole) = 12 miles.\r\n\r\n  Slope of upper surface = half-degree.]\r\n\r\nIs there any well-grounded reason for concluding the above to be an\r\nover-estimate of the actual thickness of the antarctic ice? It is not\r\nso much in consequence of any _à priori_ reason that can be urged\r\nagainst the probability of such a thickness of ice, but rather because\r\nit so far transcends our previous experience that we are reluctant to\r\nadmit such an estimate. If we never had any experience of ice thicker\r\nthan what is found in England, we should feel startled on learning for\r\nthe first time that in the valleys of Switzerland the ice lay from 200\r\nto 300 feet in depth. Again, if we had never heard of glaciers thicker\r\nthan those of Switzerland, we could hardly credit the statement that\r\nin Greenland they are actually from 2,000 to 3,000 feet thick. We, in\r\nthis country, have long been familiar with Greenland; but till very\r\nlately no one ever entertained the idea that that continent was buried\r\nunder one continuous mass of ice, with scarcely a mountain top rising\r\nabove the icy mantle. And had it not been that the geological phenomena\r\nof the glacial epoch have for so many years accustomed our minds to\r\nsuch an extraordinary condition of things, Dr. Rink’s description of\r\nthe Greenland ice would probably have been regarded as the extravagant\r\npicture of a wild imagination.\r\n\r\nLet us now consider whether or not the facts of observation and\r\nexperience, so far as they go, bear out the conclusions to which\r\nphysical considerations lead us in reference to the magnitude of\r\ncontinental ice; and more especially as regards the ice of the\r\nantarctic regions.\r\n\r\n_First._ In so far as the antarctic ice-sheet is concerned, observation\r\nand experience to a great extent may be said to be a perfect blank. One\r\nor two voyagers have seen the outer edge of the sheet at a few places,\r\nand this is all. In fact, we judge of the present condition of the\r\ninterior of the antarctic continent in a great measure from what we\r\nknow of Greenland. But again, our experience of Greenland ice is almost\r\nwholly confined to the outskirts.\r\n\r\nFew have penetrated into the interior, and, with the exception of Dr.\r\nHayes and Professor Nordenskjöld, none, as far as I know, have passed\r\nto any considerable distance over the inland ice. Dr. Robert Brown\r\nin his interesting memoir on “Das Innere von Grönland,”[207] gives\r\nan account of an excursion made in 1747 by a Danish officer of the\r\nname of Dalager, from Fredrikshaab, near the southern extremity of\r\nthe continent, into the interior. After a journey of a day or two, he\r\nreached an eminence from which he saw the inland ice stretching in an\r\nunbroken mass as far as the eye could reach, but was unable to proceed\r\nfurther. Dr. Brown gives an account also of an excursion made in the\r\nbeginning of March, 1830, by O. B. Kielsen, a Danish whale-fisher, from\r\nHolsteinborg (lat. 67° N.). After a most fatiguing journey of several\r\ndays, he reached a high point from which he could see the ice of the\r\ninterior. Next morning he got up early, and towards midday reached\r\nan extensive plain. From this the land sank inwards, and Kielsen now\r\nsaw fully in view before him the enormous ice-sheet of the interior.\r\nHe drove rapidly over all the little hills, lakes, and streams, till\r\nhe reached a pretty large lake at the edge of the ice-sheet. This was\r\nthe end of his journey, for after vainly attempting to climb up on the\r\nice-sheet, he was compelled to retrace his steps, and had a somewhat\r\ndifficult return. When he arrived at the fiord, he found the ice broken\r\nup, so that he had to go round by the land way, by which he reached\r\nthe depôt on the 9th of March. The distance which he traversed in a\r\nstraight line from Holsteinborg into the interior measured eighty\r\nEnglish miles.\r\n\r\nDr. Hayes’s excursion was made, however, not upon the real inland\r\nice, but upon a smaller ice-field connected with it; while Professor\r\nNordenskjöld’s excursion was made at a place too far south to\r\nafford an accurate idea of the actual condition of the interior of\r\nNorth Greenland, even though he had penetrated much farther than he\r\nactually did. However, the state of things as recorded by Hayes and by\r\nNordenskjöld affords us a glimpse into the condition of things in the\r\ninterior of the continent. They both found by observation, what follows\r\nas a necessary result from physical considerations, that the upper\r\nsurface of the ice plain, under which hills and valleys are buried,\r\ngradually _slopes upwards towards the interior of the continent_.\r\nProfessor Nordenskjöld states that when at the extreme point at which\r\nhe reached, thirty geographical miles from the coast, he had attained\r\nan elevation of 2,200 feet, and that the inland ice _continued\r\nconstantly to rise_ towards the interior, so that the horizon towards\r\nthe east, north, and south, was terminated by an ice-border almost as\r\nsmooth as that of the ocean.”[208]\r\n\r\nDr. Hayes and his party penetrated inwards to the distance of about\r\nseventy miles. On the first day they reached the foot of the great Mer\r\nde Glace; the second day’s journey carried them to the upper surface\r\nof the ice-sheet. On the third day they travelled 30 miles, and the\r\nascent, which had been about 6°, diminished gradually to about 2°. They\r\nadvanced on the fourth day about 25 miles; the temperature being 30°\r\nbelow zero (Fah.). “Our station at the camp,” he says, “was sublime as\r\nit was dangerous. We had attained an altitude of 5,000 feet above the\r\nsea-level, and were 70 miles from the coast, in the midst of a vast\r\nfrozen Sahara immeasurable to the human eye. There was neither hill,\r\nmountain, nor gorge, anywhere in view. We had completely sunk the\r\nstrip of land between the Mer de Glace and the sea, and no object met\r\nthe eye but our feeble tent, which bent to the storm. Fitful clouds\r\nswept over the face of the full-orbed moon, which, descending towards\r\nthe horizon, glimmered through the drifting snow that scudded over the\r\nicy plain—to the eye in undulating lines of downy softness, to the\r\nflesh in showers of piercing darts.”[209]\r\n\r\nDr. Rink, referring to the inland ice, says that the elevation or\r\nheight above the sea of this icy plain at its junction with the\r\noutskirts of the country, and where it begins to lower itself through\r\nthe valleys to the firths, is, in the ramifications of the Bay of\r\nOmenak, found to be 2,000 feet, from which level _it gradually rises\r\ntowards the interior_.[210]\r\n\r\nDr. Robert Brown, who, along with Mr. Whymper in 1867, attempted a\r\njourney to some distance over the inland ice, is of opinion that\r\nGreenland is not traversed by any ranges of mountains or high land,\r\nbut that the entire continent, 1,200 miles in length and 400 miles in\r\nbreadth, is covered with one continuous unbroken field of ice, the\r\nupper surface of which, he says, _rises by a gentle slope towards the\r\ninterior_.[211]\r\n\r\nSuppose now the point reached by Hayes to be within 200 miles of\r\nthe centre of dispersion of the ice, and the mean slope from that\r\npoint to the centre, as in the case of the antarctic cap, to be only\r\nhalf a degree; this would give 10,000 feet as the elevation of the\r\ncentre above the point reached. But the point reached was 5,000 feet\r\nabove sea-level, consequently the surface of the ice at the centre\r\nof dispersion would be 15,000 feet above sea-level, which is about\r\none-fourth what I have concluded to be the elevation of the surface\r\nof the antarctic ice-cap at its centre. And supposing we assume\r\nthe general surface of the ground to have in the central region an\r\nelevation as great as 5,000 feet, which is not at all probable, still\r\nthis would give 10,000 feet for the thickness of the ice at the centre\r\nof the Greenland continent. But if we admit this conclusion in\r\nreference to the thickness of the Greenland ice, we must admit that\r\nthe antarctic ice is far thicker, because the thickness, other things\r\nbeing equal, will depend upon the size, or, more properly, upon the\r\ndiameter of the continent; for the larger the surface the greater is\r\nthe thickness of ice required to produce the pressure requisite to make\r\nthe rate of discharge of the ice equal to the rate of increase. Now\r\nthe area of the antarctic continent must be at least a dozen of times\r\ngreater than that of Greenland.\r\n\r\n_Second._ That the antarctic ice must be far thicker than the arctic\r\nis further evident from the dimensions of the icebergs which have been\r\nmet with in the Southern Ocean. No icebergs over three hundred feet in\r\nheight have been found in the arctic regions, whereas in the antarctic\r\nregions, as we shall see, icebergs of twice and even thrice that height\r\nhave been reported.\r\n\r\n_Third._ We have no reason to believe that the thickness of the ice\r\nat present covering the antarctic continent is less than that which\r\ncovered a continent of a similar area in temperate regions during the\r\nglacial epoch. Take, for example, the North American continent, or,\r\nmore properly, that portion of it covered by ice during the glacial\r\nepoch. Professor Dana has proved that during that period the thickness\r\nof the ice on the American continent must in many places have been\r\nconsiderably over a mile. He has shown that over the northern border of\r\nNew England the ice had a mean thickness of 6,500 feet, while its mean\r\nthickness over the Canada watershed, between St. Lawrence and Hudson’s\r\nBay, was not less than 12,000 feet, or upwards of two miles and a\r\nquarter (see _American Journal of Science and Art_ for March, 1873).\r\n\r\n_Fourth._ Some may object to the foregoing estimate of the amount of\r\nice on the antarctic continent, on the grounds that the quantity of\r\nsnowfall in that region cannot be much. But it must be borne in mind\r\nthat, no matter however small the annual amount of snowfall may be, if\r\nmore falls than is melted, the ice must continue to accumulate year by\r\nyear till its thickness in the centre of the continent be sufficiently\r\ngreat to produce motion. The opinion that the snowfall of the antarctic\r\nregions is not great does not, however, appear to be borne out by the\r\nobservation and experience of those who have visited those regions.\r\nCaptain Wilkes, of the American Exploring Expedition, estimated it at\r\n30 feet per annum; and Sir James Ross says, that during a whole month\r\nthey had only three days free from snow. The fact that perpetual snow\r\nis found at the sea-level at lat. 64° S. proves that the snowfall\r\nmust be great. But there is another circumstance which must be taken\r\ninto account, viz., that the currents carrying moisture move in from\r\nall directions towards the pole, consequently the area on which they\r\ndeposit their snow becomes less and less as the pole is reached, and\r\nthis must, to a corresponding extent, increase the quantity of snow\r\nfalling on a given area. Let us assume, for example, that the clouds\r\nin passing from lat. 60° to lat. 80° deposit moisture sufficient to\r\nproduce, say, 30 feet of snow per annum, and that by the time they\r\nreach lat. 80° they are in possession of only one-tenth part of their\r\noriginal store of moisture. As the area between lat. 80° and the\r\npole is but one-eighth of that between lat. 60° and 80°, this would,\r\nnotwithstanding, give 24 feet as the annual amount of snowfall between\r\nlat. 80° and the pole.[212]\r\n\r\n_Fifth._ The enormous size and thickness of the icebergs which have\r\nbeen met with in the Southern Ocean testify to the thickness of the\r\nantarctic ice-cap.\r\n\r\nWe know from the size of some of the icebergs which have been met with\r\nin the southern hemisphere that the ice at the edge of the cap where\r\nthe bergs break off must in some cases be considerably over a mile in\r\nthickness, for icebergs of more than a mile in thickness have been\r\nfound in the southern hemisphere. The following are the dimensions of\r\na few of these enormous bergs taken from the Twelfth Number of the\r\nMeteorological Papers published by the Board of Trade, and from the\r\nexcellent paper of Mr. Towson on the Icebergs of the Southern Ocean,\r\npublished also by the Board of Trade.[213] With one or two exceptions,\r\nthe heights of the bergs were accurately determined by angular\r\nmeasurement:—\r\n\r\n\r\n  Sept. 10th, 1856.—The _Lightning_, when in lat. 55° 33′ S.,\r\n    long. 140° W., met with an iceberg 420 feet high.\r\n\r\n  Nov., 1839.—In lat. 41° S., long. 87° 30′ E., numerous icebergs\r\n    400 feet high were met with.\r\n\r\n  Sept., 1840.—In lat. 37° S., long. 15° E., an iceberg 1,000\r\n    feet long and 400 feet high was met with.\r\n\r\n  Feb., 1860.—Captain Clark, of the _Lightning_, when in lat. 55°\r\n    20′ S., long. 122° 45′ W., found an iceberg 500 feet high and 3\r\n    miles long.\r\n\r\n  Dec. 1st, 1859.—An iceberg, 580 feet high, and from two and a\r\n    half to three miles long, was seen by Captain Smithers, of the\r\n    _Edmond_, in lat. 50° 52′ S., long. 43° 58′ W. So strongly did\r\n    this iceberg resemble land, that Captain Smithers believed it\r\n    to be an island, and reported it as such, but there is little\r\n    or no doubt that it was in reality an iceberg. There were\r\n    pieces of drift-ice under its lee.\r\n\r\n  Nov., 1856.—Three large icebergs, 500 feet high, were found in\r\n    lat. 41° 0′ S., long. 42° 0′ E.\r\n\r\n  Jan., 1861.—Five icebergs, one 500 feet high, were met with in\r\n    lat. 55° 46′ S., long. 155° 56′ W.\r\n\r\n  Jan., 1861.—In lat. 56° 10′ S., long. 160° 0′ W., an iceberg\r\n    500 feet high and half a mile long was found.\r\n\r\n  Jan., 1867.—The barque _Scout_, from the West Coast of\r\n    America, on her way to Liverpool, passed some icebergs 600 feet\r\n    in height, and of great length.\r\n\r\n  April, 1864.—The _Royal Standard_ came in collision with an\r\n    iceberg 600 feet in height.\r\n\r\n  Dec., 1856.—Four large icebergs, one of them 700 feet high, and\r\n    another 500 feet, were met with in lat. 50° 14′ S., long. 42°\r\n    54′ E.\r\n\r\n  Dec. 25th, 1861.—The _Queen of Nations_ fell in with an iceberg\r\n    in lat. 53° 45′ S., long. 170° 0′ W., 720 feet high.\r\n\r\n  Dec., 1856.—Captain P. Wakem, ship _Ellen Radford_, found, in\r\n    lat. 52° 31′ S., long. 43° 43′ W., two large icebergs, one at\r\n    least 800 feet high.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Towson states that one of our most celebrated and talented\r\n    naval surveyors informed him that he had seen icebergs in the\r\n    southern regions 800 feet high.\r\n\r\n  March 23rd, 1855.—The _Agneta_ passed an iceberg in lat. 53°\r\n    14′ S., long. 14° 41′ E., 960 feet in height.\r\n\r\n  Aug. 16th, 1840.—The Dutch ship, _General Baron von Geen_,\r\n    passed an iceberg 1,000 feet high in lat. 37° 32′ S., long. 14°\r\n    10′ E.\r\n\r\n  May 15th, 1859.—The _Roseworth_ found in lat. 53° 40′ S., long.\r\n    123° 17′ W., an iceberg as large as “Tristan d’Acunha.”\r\n\r\nIn the regions where most of these icebergs were met with, the mean\r\ndensity of the sea is about 1·0256. The density of ice is ·92. The\r\ndensity of icebergs to that of the sea is therefore as 1 to 1·115;\r\nconsequently every foot of ice above water indicates 8·7 feet below\r\nwater. It therefore follows that those icebergs 400 feet high had 3,480\r\nfeet under water,—3,880 feet would consequently be the total thickness\r\nof the ice. The icebergs which were 500 feet high would be 4,850 feet\r\nthick, those 600 feet high would have a total thickness of 5,820 feet,\r\nand those 700 feet high would be no less than 6,790 feet thick, which\r\nis more than a mile and a quarter. The iceberg 960 feet high, sighted\r\nby the _Agneta_, would be actually 9,312 feet thick, which is upwards\r\nof a mile and three-quarters.\r\n\r\nAlthough the mass of an iceberg below water compared to that above\r\nmay be taken to be about 8·7 to 1, yet it would not be always safe\r\nto conclude that the thickness of the ice below water bears the same\r\nproportion to its height above. If the berg, for example, be much\r\nbroader at its base than at its top, the thickness of the ice below\r\nwater would bear a less proportion to the height above water than\r\nas 8·7 to 1. But a berg such as that recorded by Captain Clark, 500\r\nfeet high and three miles long, must have had only 1/8·7 of its total\r\nthickness above water. The same remark applies also to the one seen by\r\nCaptain Smithers, which was 580 feet high, and so large that it was\r\ntaken for an island. This berg must have been 5,628 feet in thickness.\r\nThe enormous berg which came in collision with the _Royal Standard_\r\nmust have been 5,820 feet thick. It is not stated what length the\r\nicebergs 730, 960, and 1,000 feet high respectively were; but supposing\r\nthat we make considerable allowance for the possibility that the\r\nproportionate thickness of ice below water to that above may have been\r\nless than as 8·7 to 1, still we can hardly avoid the conclusion that\r\nthe icebergs were considerably above a mile in thickness. But if there\r\nare icebergs above a mile in thickness, then there must be land-ice\r\nsomewhere on the southern hemisphere of that thickness. In short, the\r\ngreat antarctic ice-cap must in some places be over a mile in thickness\r\nat its edge.\r\n\r\n_Inadequate Conceptions regarding the Magnitude of Continental\r\nIce._—Few things have tended more to mislead geologists in the\r\ninterpretation of glacial phenomena than inadequate conceptions\r\nregarding the magnitude of continental ice. Without the conception\r\nof continental ice the known facts connected with glaciation would\r\nbe perfectly inexplicable. It was only when it was found that the\r\naccumulated facts refused to be explained by any other conception,\r\nthat belief in the very existence of such a thing as continental ice\r\nbecame common. But although most geologists now admit the existence of\r\ncontinental ice, yet, nevertheless, adequate conceptions of its real\r\nmagnitude are by no means so common. Year by year, as the outstanding\r\nfacts connected with glaciation accumulate, we are compelled to extend\r\nour conceptions of the magnitude of land-ice. Take the following as\r\nan example. It was found that the transport of the Wastdale Crag\r\nblocks, the direction of the striæ on the islands of the Baltic, on\r\nCaithness and on the Orkney, Shetland, and Faroe, islands, the boulder\r\nclay with broken shells in Caithness, Holderness, and other places,\r\nwere inexplicable on the theory of land-ice. But it was so only in\r\nconsequence of the inadequacy of our conceptions of the magnitude of\r\nthe ice; for a slight extension of our ideas of its thickness has\r\nexplained not only these phenomena,[214] but others of an equally\r\nremarkable character, such as the striation of the Long Island and\r\nthe submerged rock-basins around our coasts described by Mr. James\r\nGeikie. In like manner, if we admit the theory of the glacial epoch\r\npropounded in former chapters, all that is really necessary to account\r\nfor the submergence of the land is a slight extension of our hitherto\r\npreconceived estimate of the thickness of the ice on the antarctic\r\ncontinent. If we simply admit a conclusion to which all physical\r\nconsiderations, as we have seen, necessarily lead us, viz., that the\r\nantarctic continent is covered with a mantle of ice at least two miles\r\nin thickness, we have then a complete explanation of the cause of the\r\nsubmergence of the land during the glacial epoch.\r\n\r\nAlthough of no great importance to the question under consideration, it\r\nmay be remarked that, except during the severest part of the glacial\r\nepoch, we have no reason to believe that the total quantity of ice\r\non the globe was much greater than at present, only it would then be\r\nall on one hemisphere. Remove two miles of ice from the antarctic\r\ncontinent, and place it on the northern hemisphere, and this, along\r\nwith the ice that now exists on this hemisphere, would equal, in all\r\nprobability, the quantity existing on our hemisphere during the glacial\r\nepoch; at least, before it reached its maximum severity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\n    THE PHYSICAL CAUSE OF THE SUBMERGENCE AND EMERGENCE OF THE LAND\r\n                DURING THE GLACIAL EPOCH.—_Continued._\r\n\r\n  Extent of Submergence from Displacement of Earth’s Centre\r\n      of Gravity.—Circumstances which show that the Glacial\r\n      Submergence resulted from Displacement of the Earth’s\r\n      Centre of Gravity.—Agreement between Theory and observed\r\n      Facts.—Sir Charles Lyell on submerged Areas during\r\n      Tertiary Period.—Oscillations of Sea-level in Relation to\r\n      Distribution.—Extent of Submergence on the Hypothesis that\r\n      the Earth is fluid in the Interior.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Extent of Submergence from Displacement of Earth’s Centre of\r\nGravity._—How much, then, would the transference of the two miles of\r\nice from the southern to the northern hemisphere raise the level of the\r\nocean on the latter hemisphere? This mass, be it observed, is equal to\r\nonly one-half that represented in our section. A considerable amount\r\nof discussion has arisen in regard to the method of determining this\r\npoint. According to the method already detailed, which supposes the\r\nrise at the pole to be equal to the extent of the displacement of the\r\nearth’s centre of gravity, the rise at the North Pole would be about\r\n380 feet, taking into account the effect produced by the displaced\r\nwater; and the rise in the latitude of Edinburgh would be 312 feet. The\r\nfall of level on the southern hemisphere would, of course, be equal to\r\nthe rise of level on the northern. According to the method advanced\r\nby Mr. D. D. Heath,[215] the rise of level at the North Pole would be\r\nabout 650 feet. Archdeacon Pratt’s method[216] makes the rise still\r\ngreater; while according to Rev. O. Fisher’s method[217] the rise would\r\nbe no less than 2,000 feet. There is, however, another circumstance\r\nwhich must be taken into account, which will give an additional rise of\r\nupwards of one hundred feet.\r\n\r\nThe greatest extent of the displacement of the earth’s centre of\r\ngravity, and consequently the greatest rise of the ocean resulting\r\nfrom that displacement, would of course occur at the time of maximum\r\nglaciation, when the ice was all on one hemisphere. But owing to the\r\nfollowing circumstance, a still greater rise than that resulting from\r\nthe displacement of the earth’s centre of gravity alone might take\r\nplace at some considerable time, either before or after the period of\r\nmaximum glaciation.\r\n\r\nIt is not at all probable that the ice would melt on the warm\r\nhemisphere at exactly the same rate as it would form on the cold\r\nhemisphere. It is probable that the ice would melt more rapidly on the\r\nwarm hemisphere than it would form on the cold. Suppose that during\r\nthe glacial epoch, at a time when the cold was gradually increasing on\r\nthe northern and the warmth on the southern hemisphere, the ice should\r\nmelt more rapidly off the antarctic continent than it was being formed\r\non the arctic and subarctic regions; suppose also that, by the time\r\na quantity of ice, equal to one-half what exists at present on the\r\nantarctic continent, had accumulated on the northern hemisphere, the\r\nwhole of the antarctic ice had been melted away, the sea would then be\r\nfuller than at present by the amount of water resulting from the one\r\nmile of melted ice. The height to which this would raise the general\r\nlevel of the sea would be as follows:—\r\n\r\nThe antarctic ice-cap is equal in area to 1/23·46 of that covered by\r\nthe ocean. The density of ice to that of water being taken at ·92 to\r\n1, it follows that 25 feet 6 inches of ice melted off the cap would\r\nraise the general level of the ocean one foot, and the one mile of\r\nice melted off would raise the level 200 feet. This 200 feet of rise\r\nresulting from the melted ice we must add to the rise resulting from\r\nthe displacement of the earth’s centre of gravity. The removal of the\r\ntwo miles of ice from the antarctic continent would displace the\r\ncentre of gravity 190 feet, and the formation of a mass of ice equal\r\nto the one-half of this on the arctic regions would carry the centre\r\nof gravity 95 feet farther; giving in all a total displacement of 285\r\nfeet, thus producing a rise of sea-level at the North Pole of 285 feet,\r\nand in the latitude of Edinburgh of 234 feet. Add to this the rise of\r\n200 feet resulting from the melted ice, and we have then 485 feet of\r\nsubmergence at the pole, and 434 feet in the latitude of Edinburgh. A\r\nrise to a similar extent might probably take place after the period\r\nof maximum glaciation, when the ice would be melting on the northern\r\nhemisphere more rapidly than it would be forming on the southern.\r\n\r\nIf we assume the antarctic ice-cap to be as thick as is represented in\r\nthe diagram, the extent of the submergence would of course be double\r\nthe above, and we might have in this case a rise of sea-level in the\r\nlatitude of Edinburgh to the extent of from 800 to 1,000 feet. But be\r\nthis as it may, it is evident that the quantity of ice on the antarctic\r\ncontinent is perfectly sufficient to account for the submergence of\r\nthe glacial epoch, for we have little evidence to conclude that the\r\n_general_ submergence much exceeded 400 or 500 feet.[218] We have\r\nevidence in England and other places of submergence to the extent of\r\nfrom 1,000 to 2,000 feet, but these may be quite local, resulting\r\nfrom subsidence of the land in those particular areas. Elevations and\r\ndepressions of the land have taken place in all ages, and no doubt\r\nduring the glacial epoch also.\r\n\r\n_Circumstances which show that the Glacial Submergence resulted from\r\nDisplacement of the Earth’s Centre of Gravity._—In favour of this\r\nview of the cause of the submergence of the glacial epoch, it is a\r\ncircumstance of some significance, that in every part of the globe\r\nwhere glaciation has been found evidence of the submergence of the\r\nland has also been found along with it. The invariable occurrence of\r\nsubmergence along with glaciation points to some physical connection\r\nbetween the two. It would seem to imply, either that the two were the\r\ndirect effects of a common cause, or that the one was the cause of the\r\nother; that is, the submergence the cause of the glaciation, or the\r\nglaciation the cause of the submergence. There is, I presume, no known\r\ncause to which the two can be directly related as effects. Nor do I\r\nthink that there is any one who would suppose that the submergence of\r\nthe land could have been the cause of its glaciation, even although he\r\nattributed all glacial effects to floating ice. The submergence of our\r\ncountry would, of course, have allowed floating ice to pass over it had\r\nthere been any to pass over; but submergence would not have produced\r\nthe ice, neither would it have brought the ice from the arctic regions\r\nwhere it already existed. But although submergence could not have been\r\nthe cause of the glacial epoch, yet we can, as we have just seen,\r\neasily understand how the ice of the glacial epoch could have been the\r\ncause of the submergence. If the glacial epoch was brought about by an\r\nincrease in the eccentricity of the earth’s orbit, then a submergence\r\nof the land as the ice accumulated was a physical necessity.\r\n\r\nThere is another circumstance connected with glacial submergence which\r\nit is difficult to reconcile with the idea that it resulted from a\r\nsubsidence of the land. It is well known that during the glacial\r\nepoch the land was not once under water only, but several times; and,\r\nbesides, there were not merely several periods when the land stood\r\nat a lower level in relation to the sea than at present, but there\r\nwere also several periods when it stood at a much higher level than\r\nnow. And this holds true, not merely of our own country, but of every\r\ncountry on the northern hemisphere where glaciation has yet been found.\r\nAll this follows as a necessary consequence from the theory that the\r\noscillations of sea-level resulted from the transference of the ice\r\nfrom the one hemisphere to the other; but it is wholly inconsistent\r\nwith the idea that they resulted from upheavals and subsidence of the\r\nland during a very recent period.\r\n\r\nBut this is not all, there is more still to be accounted for. It has\r\nbeen the prevailing opinion that at the time when the land was covered\r\nwith ice, it stood at a much greater elevation than at present. It\r\nis, however, not maintained that the facts of geology establish such\r\na conclusion. The greater elevation of the land is simply assumed as\r\nan hypothesis to account for the cold.[219] The facts of geology,\r\nhowever, are fast establishing the opposite conclusion, viz., that\r\nwhen the country was covered with ice, the land stood in relation to\r\nthe sea at a lower level than at present, and that the continental\r\nperiods or times when the land stood in relation to the sea at a higher\r\nlevel than now were the warm inter-glacial periods, when the country\r\nwas free of snow and ice, and a mild and equable condition of climate\r\nprevailed. This is the conclusion towards which we are being led by the\r\nmore recent revelations of surface geology, and also by certain facts\r\nconnected with the geographical distribution of plants and animals\r\nduring the glacial epoch.\r\n\r\nThe simple occurrence of a rise and fall of the land in relation to\r\nthe sea-level in one or in two countries during the glacial epoch,\r\nwould not necessarily imply any physical connection. The coincidence\r\nof these movements with the glaciation of the land might have been\r\npurely accidental; but when we find that a succession of such movements\r\noccurred, not merely in one or in two countries, but in every glaciated\r\ncountry where proper observations have been made, we are forced to the\r\nconclusion that the connection between the two is not accidental, but\r\nthe result of some fixed cause.\r\n\r\nIf we admit that an increase in the eccentricity of the earth’s orbit\r\nwas the cause of the glacial epoch, then we must admit that all those\r\nresults followed as necessary consequences. For if the glacial epoch\r\nlasted for upwards of one hundred thousand years or so, there would be\r\na succession of cold and warm periods, and consequently a succession\r\nof elevations and depressions of sea-level. And the elevations of\r\nthe sea-level would take place during the cold periods, and the\r\ndepressions during the warm periods.\r\n\r\nBut the agreement between theory and observed facts does not terminate\r\nhere. It follows from theory that the greatest oscillations of\r\nsea-level would take place during the severest part of the glacial\r\nepoch, when the eccentricity of the earth’s orbit would be at its\r\nhighest value, and that the oscillations would gradually diminish\r\nin extent as the eccentricity diminished and the climate gradually\r\nbecame less severe. Now it is well known that this is actually what\r\ntook place; the great submergence, as well as the great elevation or\r\ncontinental period, occurred during the earlier or more severe part of\r\nthe glacial epoch, and as the climate grew less severe these changes\r\nbecame of less extent, till we find them terminating in our submerged\r\nforests and 25-foot raised beach.\r\n\r\nIt follows, therefore, according to the theory advanced, that the mere\r\nfact of an area having been under sea does not imply that there has\r\nbeen any subsidence or elevation of the land, and that consequently the\r\ninference which has been drawn from these submerged areas as to changes\r\nin physical geography may be in many cases not well founded.\r\n\r\nSir Charles Lyell, in his “Principles,” publishes a map showing the\r\nextent of surface in Europe which has been covered by the sea since\r\nthe earlier part of the Tertiary period. This map is intended to show\r\nthe extraordinary amount of subsidence and elevation of the land which\r\nhas taken place during that period. It is necessary for Sir Charles’s\r\ntheory of the cause of the glacial epoch that changes in the physical\r\ngeography of the globe to an enormous extent should have taken place\r\nduring a very recent period, in order to account for the great change\r\nof climate which occurred at that epoch. But if the foregoing results\r\nbe anything like correct, it does not necessarily follow that there\r\nmust have been great changes in the physical geography of Europe,\r\nsimply because the sea covered those areas marked in the map, for this\r\nmay have been produced by oscillations of sea-level, and not by changes\r\nin the land. In fact, the areas marked in Sir Charles’s map as having\r\nbeen covered by the sea, are just those which would be covered were the\r\nsea-level raised a few hundred feet. No doubt there were elevations and\r\nsubsidences in many of the areas marked in the map during the Tertiary\r\nperiod, and to this cause a considerable amount of the submergence\r\nmight be due; but I have little doubt that by far the greater part\r\nmust be attributed to oscillations of sea-level. It is no objection\r\nthat the greater part of the shells and other organic remains found\r\nin the marine deposits of those areas are not indicative of a cold\r\nor glacial condition of climate, for, as we have seen, the greatest\r\nsubmergence would probably have taken place either before the more\r\nsevere cold had set in or after it had to a great extent passed away.\r\nThat the submergence of those areas probably resulted from elevations\r\nof sea-level rather than depressions of the land, is further evident\r\nfrom the following considerations. If we suppose that the climate of\r\nthe glacial epoch was brought about mainly by changes in the physical\r\ngeography of the globe, we must assume that these great changes took\r\nplace, geologically speaking, at a very recent date. Then when we ask\r\nwhat ground is there for assuming that any such change in the relations\r\nof sea and land as is required actually took place, the submergence\r\nof those areas is adduced as the proof. Did it follow as a physical\r\nnecessity that all submergence must be the result of subsidence of the\r\nland, and not of elevations of the sea, there would be some force in\r\nthe reasons adduced. But such a conclusion by no means follows, and,\r\n_à priori_, it is just as likely that the appearance of the ice was\r\nthe cause of the submergence as that the submergence was the cause\r\nof the appearance of the ice. Again, a subsidence of the land to the\r\nextent required would to a great extent have altered the configuration\r\nof the country, and the main river systems of Europe; but there is no\r\nevidence that any such change has taken place. All the main valleys\r\nare well known to have existed prior to the glacial epoch, and our\r\nrivers to have occupied the same channels then as they do now. In the\r\ncase of some of the smaller streams, it is true, a slight deviation\r\nhas resulted at some points from the filling up of their channels with\r\ndrift during the glacial epoch; but as a general rule all the principal\r\nvalleys and river systems are older than the glacial epoch. This, of\r\ncourse, could not be the case if a subsidence of the land sufficiently\r\ngreat to account for the submergence of the areas in question, or\r\nchanges in the physical geography of Europe necessary to produce a\r\nglacial epoch, had actually taken place. The total absence of any\r\ngeological evidence for the existence of any change which could explain\r\neither the submergence of the areas in question or the climate of the\r\nglacial epoch, is strong evidence that the submergence of the glacial\r\nepoch, as well as of the areas in question, was the result of a simple\r\noscillation of sea-level resulting from the displacement of the earth’s\r\ncentre of gravity by the transferrence of the ice-cap from the southern\r\nto the northern hemisphere.\r\n\r\n_Oscillations of Sea-level in relation to Distribution._—The\r\noscillations of sea-level resulting from the displacement of the\r\nearth’s centre of gravity help to throw new light on some obscure\r\npoints connected with the subject of the geographical distribution\r\nof plants and animals. At the time when the ice was on the southern\r\nhemisphere during the glacial epoch, and the northern hemisphere was\r\nenjoying a warm and equable climate, the sea-level would be several\r\nhundred feet lower than at present, the North Sea would probably be\r\ndry land, and Great Britain and Ireland joined to the continent, thus\r\nopening up a pathway from the continent to our island. As has been\r\nshown in former chapters, during the inter-glacial periods the climate\r\nwould be much warmer and more equable than now, so that animals from\r\nthe south, such as the hippopotamus, hyæna, lion, _Elephas antiquus_\r\nand _Rhinoceros megarhinus_, would migrate into this country, where\r\nat present they could not live in consequence of the cold. We have\r\ntherefore an explanation, as was suggested on a former occasion,[220]\r\nof the fact that the bones of these animals are found mingled in the\r\nsame grave with those of the musk-ox, mammoth, reindeer, and other\r\nanimals which lived in this country during the cold periods of the\r\nglacial epoch; the animals from the north would cross over into this\r\ncountry upon the frozen sea during the cold periods, while those from\r\nthe south would find the English Channel dry land during the warm\r\nperiods.\r\n\r\nThe same reasoning will hold equally true in reference to the old\r\nand new world. The depth of Behring Straits is under 30 fathoms;\r\nconsequently a lowering of the sea-level of less than 200 feet would\r\nconnect Asia with America, and thus allow plants and animals, as Mr.\r\nDarwin believes, to pass from the one continent to the other.[221]\r\nDuring this period, when Behring Straits would be dry land, Greenland\r\nwould be comparatively free from ice, and the arctic regions enjoying a\r\ncomparatively mild climate. In this case plants and animals belonging\r\nto temperate regions could avail themselves of this passage, and thus\r\nwe can explain how plants belonging to temperate regions may have,\r\nduring the Miocene period, passed from the old to the new continent,\r\nand _vice versâ_.\r\n\r\nAs has already been noticed, during the time of the greatest extension\r\nof the ice, the quantity of ice on the southern hemisphere might be\r\nconsiderably greater than what exists on the entire globe at present.\r\nIn that case there might, in addition to the lowering of the sea-level\r\nresulting from the displacement of the earth’s centre of gravity, be a\r\nconsiderable lowering resulting from the draining of the ocean to form\r\nthe additional ice. This decrease and increase in the total quantity\r\nof ice which we have considered would affect the level of the ocean as\r\nmuch at the equator as at the poles; consequently during the glacial\r\nepoch there might have been at the equator elevations and depressions\r\nof sea-level to the extent of a few hundred feet.\r\n\r\n_Extent of Submergence on the Hypothesis that the Earth is fluid in\r\nthe Interior._—But we have been proceeding upon the supposition that\r\nthe earth is solid to its centre. If we assume, however, what is the\r\ngeneral opinion among geologists, that it consists of a fluid interior\r\nsurrounded by a thick and rigid crust or shell, then the extent of the\r\nsubmergence resulting from the displacement of the centre of gravity\r\nfor a given thickness of ice must be much greater than I have estimated\r\nit to be. This is evident, because, if the interior of the globe be in\r\na fluid state, it, in all probability, consists of materials differing\r\nin density. The densest materials will be at the centre, and the least\r\ndense at the outside or surface. Now the transferrence of an ice-cap\r\nfrom the one pole to the other will not merely displace the ocean—the\r\nfluid mass on the outside of the shell—but it will also displace the\r\nheavier fluid materials in the interior of the shell. In other words,\r\nthe heavier materials will be attracted by the ice-cap more forcibly\r\nthan the lighter, consequently they will approach towards the cap to a\r\ncertain extent, sinking, as it were, into the lighter materials, and\r\ndisplacing them towards the opposite pole. This displacement will of\r\ncourse tend to shift the earth’s centre of gravity in the direction\r\nof the ice-cap, because the heavier materials are shifted in this\r\ndirection, and the lighter materials in the opposite direction. This\r\nprocess will perhaps be better understood from the following figures.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 8. Fig. 9.\r\n\r\n  O. The Ocean.\r\n\r\n  S. Solid Crust or Shell.\r\n\r\n  F, F^1, F^2, F^3. The various concentric layers of the fluid\r\n  interior. The layers increase in density towards the centre.\r\n\r\n  I. The Ice-cap.\r\n\r\n  C. Centre of gravity.\r\n\r\n  C^1. The displaced centre of gravity.]\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 8, where there is no ice-cap, the centre of gravity of the\r\nearth coincides with the centre of the concentric layers of the fluid\r\ninterior. In Fig. 9, where there is an ice-cap placed on one pole, the\r\nconcentric layer F^1 being denser than layer F, is attracted towards\r\nthe cap more forcibly than F, and consequently sinks to a certain depth\r\nin F. Again, F^2 being denser than F^1, it also sinks to a certain\r\nextent in F^1. And again F^3, the mass at the centre, being denser than\r\nF^2, it also sinks in F^2. All this being combined with the effects\r\nof the ice-cap, and the displaced ocean outside the shell, the centre\r\nof gravity of the entire globe will no longer be at C, but at C^1, a\r\nconsiderable distance nearer to the side of the shell on which the\r\ncap rests than C, and also a considerable distance nearer than it\r\nwould have been had the interior of the globe been solid. There are\r\nhere three causes tending to shift the centre of gravity, (1) the\r\nice-cap, (2) the displaced ocean, and (3) the displaced materials in\r\nthe interior. Two of the three causes mutually react on each other in\r\nsuch a way as to increase each other’s effect. Thus the more the ocean\r\nis drawn in the direction of the ice-cap, the more effect it has in\r\ndrawing the heavier materials in the interior in the same direction;\r\nand in turn the more the heavier materials in the interior are drawn\r\ntowards the cap, the greater is the displacement of the earth’s centre\r\nof gravity, and of course, as a consequence, the greater is the\r\ndisplacement of the ocean. It may be observed also that, other things\r\nbeing equal, the thinner the solid crust or shell is, and the greater\r\nthe difference in the density of the fluid materials in the interior,\r\nthe greater will be the extent of the displacement of the ocean,\r\nbecause the greater will be the displacement of the centre of gravity.\r\n\r\nIt follows that if we knew (1) the extent of the general submergence of\r\nthe glacial epoch, and (2) the present amount of ice on the southern\r\nhemisphere, we could determine whether or not the earth is fluid in the\r\ninterior.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\n   THE INFLUENCE OF THE OBLIQUITY OF THE ECLIPTIC ON CLIMATE AND ON\r\n                         THE LEVEL OF THE SEA.\r\n\r\n  The direct Effect of Change of Obliquity on Climate.—Mr.\r\n      Stockwell on the maximum Change of Obliquity.—How Obliquity\r\n      affects the Distribution of Heat over the Globe.—Increase of\r\n      Obliquity diminishes the Heat at the Equator and increases\r\n      that at the Poles.—Influence of Change of Obliquity on the\r\n      Level of the Sea.—When the Obliquity was last at its superior\r\n      Limit.—Probable Date of the 25-foot raised Beach.—Probable\r\n      Extent of Rise of Sea-level resulting from Increase of\r\n      Obliquity.—Lieutenant-Colonel Drayson’s and Mr. Belt’s\r\n      Theories.—Sir Charles Lyell on Influence of Obliquity.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The direct Effect of Change in the Obliquity of the Ecliptic on\r\nClimate._—There is still another cause which, I feel convinced, must to\r\na very considerable extent have affected climate during past geological\r\nages. I refer to the change in the obliquity of the ecliptic. This\r\ncause has long engaged the attention of geologists and physicists,\r\nand the conclusion generally come to is that no great effect can be\r\nattributed to it. After giving special attention to the matter, I have\r\nbeen led to the very opposite conclusion. It is quite true, as has\r\nbeen urged, that the changes in the obliquity of the ecliptic cannot\r\nsensibly affect the climate of temperate regions; but it will produce\r\na slight change on the climate of tropical latitudes, and a very\r\nconsiderable effect on that of the polar regions, especially at the\r\npoles themselves. We shall now consider the matter briefly.\r\n\r\nIt was found by Laplace that the obliquity of the ecliptic will\r\noscillate to the extent of 1° 22′ 34″ on each side of 23° 28′, the\r\nobliquity in the year 1801.[222] This point has lately been examined\r\nby Mr. Stockwell, and the results at which he has arrived are almost\r\nidentical with those of Laplace. “The mean value of the obliquity,” he\r\nsays, “of both the apparent and fixed ecliptics to the equator is 23°\r\n17′ 17″. The limits of the obliquity of the apparent ecliptic to the\r\nequator are 24° 35′ 58″ and 21° 58′ 36″; whence it follows that the\r\ngreatest and least declinations of the sun at the solstices can never\r\ndiffer from each other to any greater extent than 2° 37′ 22″.”[223]\r\n\r\nThis change will but slightly affect the climate of the temperate\r\nregions, but it will exercise a very considerable influence on\r\nthe climate of the polar regions. According to Mr. Meech,[224] if\r\n365·24 thermal days represent the present total annual quantity of\r\nheat received at the equator from the sun, 151·59 thermal days will\r\nrepresent the quantity received at the poles. Adopting his method of\r\ncalculation, it turns out that when the obliquity of the ecliptic is at\r\nthe maximum assigned by Laplace the quantity received at the equator\r\nwould be 363·51 thermal days, and at the poles 160·04 thermal days. The\r\nequator would therefore receive 1·73 thermal days less heat, and the\r\npoles 8·45 thermal days more heat than at present.\r\n\r\n                     ANNUAL AMOUNT OF SUN’S HEAT.\r\n\r\n  +-------------------+-------------+-----------+\r\n  |  Amount in 1801.  |  Amount at  |           |\r\n  | Obliquity 23° 28′.|   maximum,  |Difference.|\r\n  |                   | 24° 50′ 34“.|           |\r\n  +---------+---------+-------------+-----------+\r\n  |Latitude.| Thermal |   Thermal   |  Thermal  |\r\n  |         |   days. |    days.    |   days.   |\r\n  |    0    |  365·24 |   363·51    |   −1·73   |\r\n  |   40    |  288·55 |   288·32    |   −0·23   |\r\n  |   70    |  173·04 |   179·14    |   +6·10   |\r\n  |   80    |  156·63 |   164·63    |   +8·00   |\r\n  |   90    |  151·59 |   160·04    |   +8·45   |\r\n  +---------+---------+-------------+-----------+\r\n\r\nWhen the obliquity was at a maximum, the poles would therefore be\r\nreceiving 19 rays for every 18 they are receiving at present. The\r\npoles would then be receiving nearly as much heat as latitude 76° is\r\nreceiving at present.\r\n\r\nThe increase of obliquity would not sensibly affect the polar winter.\r\nIt is true that it would slightly increase the breadth of the\r\nfrigid zone, but the length of the winter at the poles would remain\r\nunaffected. After the sun disappears below the horizon his rays are\r\ncompletely cut off, so that a further descent of 1° 22′ 34″ would make\r\nno material difference in the climate. In the temperate regions, the\r\nsun’s altitude at the winter solstice would be 1° 22′ 34″ less than\r\nat present. This would slightly increase the cold of winter in those\r\nregions. But the increase in the amount of heat received by the polar\r\nregions would materially affect the condition of the polar summer.\r\nWhat, then, is the rise of temperature at the poles which would result\r\nfrom the increase of 8·45 thermal days in the total amount received\r\nfrom the sun?\r\n\r\nAn increase of 8·45 thermal days, or 1/18th of the total quantity\r\nreceived from the sun, according to the mode of calculation adopted in\r\nChap. II. would produce, all other things being equal, a rise in the\r\nmean annual temperature equal to 14° or 15°.\r\n\r\nAccording to Professor Dove[225] there is a difference of 7°·6\r\nbetween the mean annual temperature of latitude 76° and the pole;\r\nthe temperature of the former being 9°·8, and that of the latter\r\n2°·2. Since it follows that when the obliquity of the ecliptic is\r\nat a maximum the poles would receive about as much heat per annum\r\nas latitude 76° receives at present, it may be supposed that the\r\ntemperature of the poles at that period ought to be no higher than\r\nthat of latitude 76° at the present time. A little consideration will,\r\nhowever, show that this by no means follows. Professor Dove’s Tables\r\nrepresent correctly the mean annual temperature corresponding to every\r\ntenth degree of latitude from the equator to the pole. But it must be\r\nobserved that the rate at which the temperature diminishes from the\r\nequator to the pole is not proportionate to the decrease in the total\r\nquantity of heat received from the sun as we pass from the equator to\r\nthe pole. Were the mean annual temperature of the various latitudes\r\nproportionate to the amount of direct heat received, the equator\r\nwould be much warmer than it actually is at present, and the poles\r\nmuch colder. The reason of this, as has been shown in Chapter II., is\r\nperfectly obvious. There is a constant transferrence of _heat_ from\r\nthe equator to the poles, and of _cold_ from the poles to the equator.\r\nThe warm water of the equator is constantly flowing towards the poles,\r\nand the cold water at the poles is constantly flowing to the equator.\r\nThe same is the case in regard to the aërial currents. Consequently\r\na great portion of the direct heat of the sun goes, not to raise the\r\ntemperature of the equator, but to heat the poles. And, on the other\r\nhand, the cold materials at the poles are transferred to the equator,\r\nand thus lower the temperature of that part of the globe to a great\r\nextent. The present difference of temperature between lat. 76° and the\r\npole, determined according to the rate at which the temperature is\r\nfound to diminish between the equator and the pole, amounts to only\r\nabout 7° or 8°. But were there no mutual transferrence of warm and\r\ncold materials between the equatorial and polar regions, and were the\r\ntemperature of each latitude to depend solely upon the direct rays of\r\nthe sun, the difference would far exceed that amount.\r\n\r\nNow, when the obliquity of the ecliptic was at its superior limit, and\r\nthe poles receiving about 1/18th more direct heat from the sun than\r\nat present, the increase of temperature due to this increase of heat\r\nwould be far more than 7° or 8. It would probably be nearly double that\r\namount.\r\n\r\n“We may, therefore, conclude that when the obliquity of the ecliptic\r\nwas at a maximum, and the poles were receiving 1/18th more heat than\r\nat present, the temperature of the poles ought to have been about 14°\r\nor 15° warmer than at the present day, _provided, of course, that\r\nthis extra heat was employed wholly in raising the temperature_. Were\r\nthe polar regions free from snow and ice, the greater portion of the\r\nextra heat would go to raise the temperature. But as those regions\r\nare covered with snow and ice, the extra heat would have no effect in\r\nraising the temperature, but would simply melt the snow and ice. The\r\nice-covered surface upon which the rays fell could never rise above\r\n32°. At the period under consideration, the total annual quantity of\r\nice melted at the poles would be 1/18th more than at present.\r\n\r\nThe general effect which the change in the obliquity of the ecliptic\r\nwould have upon the climate of the polar regions when combined with the\r\neffects resulting from the eccentricity of the earth’s orbit, would be\r\nthis:—When the eccentricity was at a very high value, the hemisphere\r\nwhose winter occurred in the aphelion (for physical reasons, which have\r\nalready been discussed)[226] would be under a condition of glaciation,\r\nwhile the other hemisphere, having its winter in perihelion, would be\r\nenjoying a warm and equable climate. When the obliquity of the ecliptic\r\nwas at a maximum, and 1/18th more heat falling at the poles than at\r\npresent, the effect would be to modify to a great extent the rigour\r\nof the glaciation in the polar zone of the hemisphere under a glacial\r\ncondition, and, on the other hand, to produce a more rapid melting\r\nof the ice on the other hemisphere enjoying the equable climate. The\r\neffects of eccentricity and obliquity thus combined would probably\r\ncompletely remove the polar ice-cap from off the latter hemisphere,\r\nand forest trees might then grow at the pole. Again, when the obliquity\r\nwas at its minimum condition and less heat reaching the poles than at\r\npresent, the glaciation of the former hemisphere would be increased and\r\nthe warmth of the latter diminished.\r\n\r\n_The Influence of Change in the Obliquity of the Ecliptic on the\r\nLevel of the Sea._—One very remarkable effect which seems to result\r\nindirectly from a variation of the obliquity under certain conditions,\r\nis an influence on the level of the sea. As this probably may have had\r\nsomething to do with those recent changes of sea-level with which the\r\nhistory of the submarine forests and raised beaches have made us all so\r\nfamiliar, it may be of interest to enter at some length into this part\r\nof this subject.\r\n\r\nIt appears almost certain that at the time when the northern winter\r\nsolstice was in the aphelion last, a rise of the sea on the northern\r\nhemisphere to a considerable number of feet must have taken place from\r\nthe combined effect of eccentricity and obliquity. About 11,700 years\r\nago, the northern winter solstice was in the aphelion. The eccentricity\r\nat that time was ·0187, being somewhat greater than it is now; but the\r\nwinters occurring in aphelion instead of, as now, in perihelion, they\r\nwould on that account be probably 10° or 15° colder than they are at\r\nthe present day. It is probable, also, for reasons stated in a previous\r\nchapter, that the Gulf-stream at that time would be considerably less\r\nthan now. This would tend to lower the temperature to a still greater\r\nextent. As snow instead of rain must have fallen during winter to a\r\ngreater extent than at present, this no doubt must have produced a\r\nslight increase in the quantity of ice on the northern hemisphere had\r\nno other cause come into operation. But the condition of things, we\r\nhave every reason to believe, must have been affected by the greater\r\nobliquity of the ecliptic at that period. We have no formula, except,\r\nperhaps, that given by Mr. Stockwell, from which to determine with\r\nperfect accuracy the extent of the obliquity at a period so remote as\r\nthe one under consideration. If we adopt the formula given by Struve\r\nand Peters, which agrees pretty nearly with that obtained from Mr.\r\nStockwell’s formula, we have the obliquity at a maximum about the time\r\nthat the solstice-point was in the aphelion. The formula given by\r\nLeverrier places the maximum somewhat later. At all events, we cannot\r\nbe far from the truth in assuming that at the time the northern winter\r\nsolstice was in the aphelion, the obliquity of the ecliptic would be\r\nabout a maximum, and that since then it has been gradually diminishing.\r\nIt is evident, then, that the annual amount of heat received by the\r\narctic regions, and especially about the pole, would be considerably\r\ngreater than at present. And as the heat received on those regions is\r\nchiefly employed in melting the ice, it is probable that the extra\r\namount of ice which would then be melted in the arctic regions would\r\nprevent that slight increase of ice which would otherwise have resulted\r\nin consequence of the winter occurring in the aphelion. The winters at\r\nthat period would be colder than they are at present, but the total\r\nquantity of ice on the northern hemisphere would not probably be\r\ngreater.\r\n\r\nLet us now turn to the southern hemisphere. As the southern winter\r\nwould then occur in the perihelion, this would tend to produce a slight\r\ndecrease in the quantity of ice on the southern hemisphere. But on this\r\nhemisphere the effects of eccentricity would not, as on the northern\r\nhemisphere, be compensated by those of obliquity; for both causes would\r\nhere tend to produce the same effect; namely, a melting of the ice in\r\nthe antarctic regions.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that at this time the quantity of warm water flowing\r\nfrom the equatorial regions into the Southern Ocean would be much\r\ngreater than at present. This would tend to raise the temperature of\r\nthe air of the antarctic regions, and thus assist in melting the ice.\r\nThese causes, combined with the great increase of heat resulting from\r\nthe change of obliquity, would tend to diminish to a considerable\r\nextent the quantity of ice on the southern hemisphere. I think we may\r\nassume that the slight increase of eccentricity at that period, the\r\noccurrence of the southern winter in perihelion, and the extra quantity\r\nof warm water flowing from the equatorial to the antarctic regions,\r\nwould produce an effect on the south polar ice-cap equal to that\r\nproduced by the increase in the obliquity of the ecliptic. It would,\r\ntherefore, follow that for every eighteen pounds of ice melted annually\r\nat present at the south pole twenty pounds would then be melted.\r\n\r\nLet us now consider the effect that this condition of things would\r\nhave upon the level of the sea. It would evidently tend to produce an\r\nelevation of the sea-level on the northern hemisphere in two ways. 1st.\r\nThe addition to the sea occasioned by the melting of the ice from off\r\nthe antarctic land would tend to raise the general level of the sea.\r\n2ndly. The removal of the ice would also tend to shift the earth’s\r\ncentre of gravity to the north of its present position—and as the sea\r\nmust shift along with the centre, a rise of the sea on the northern\r\nhemisphere would necessarily take place.\r\n\r\nThe question naturally suggests itself, might not the last rise of the\r\nsea, relative to the land, have resulted from this cause? We know that\r\nduring the period of the 25-foot beach, the time when the estuarine\r\nmud, which now forms the rich soil of the Carses of the Forth and\r\nTay, was deposited, the sea, in relation to the land, stood at least\r\n20 or 30 feet higher than at present. But immediately prior to this\r\nperiod, we have the age of the submarine forests and peat-beds, when\r\nthe sea relative to the land stood lower than it does now. We know\r\nalso that these changes of level were not mere local affairs. There\r\nseems every reason to believe that our Carse clay, as Mr. Fisher\r\nstates, is the equivalent of the marine mud, with _Scrobicularia_,\r\nwhich covers the submarine forests of England.[227] And on the other\r\nhand, those submarine forests are not confined to one locality. “They\r\nmay be traced,” says Mr. Jamieson, “round the whole of Britain and\r\nIreland, from Orkney to Cornwall, from Mayo to the shores of Fife, and\r\neven, it would seem, along a great part of the western sea-board of\r\nEurope, as if they bore witness to a period of widespread elevation,\r\nwhen Ireland and Britain, with all its numerous islands, formed one\r\nmass of dry land, united to the continent, and stretching out into the\r\nAtlantic.”[228] “These submarine forests”“ remarks De la Beche, also,\r\n“are to be found under the same general condition from the shores of\r\nScandinavia to those of Spain and Portugal, and around the British\r\nislands.”[229] Those buried forests are not confined to Europe, but\r\nare found in the valley of the Mississippi and in Nova Scotia, and\r\nother parts of North America. And again, the strata which underlie\r\nthose forests and peat-beds bear witness to the fact of a previous\r\nelevation of the sea-level. In short, we have evidence of a number of\r\noscillations of sea-level during post-tertiary times.[230]\r\n\r\nHad there been only one rise of the land relative to the sea-level, or\r\none depression, it might quite reasonably, as already remarked, have\r\nbeen attributed to an upheaval or a sinking of the ground, occasioned\r\nby some volcanic, chemical, or other agency. But certainly those\r\nrepeated oscillations of sea-level, extending as they do over so wide\r\nan area, look more like a rising and sinking of the sea than of the\r\nland. But, be this as it may, since it is now established, I presume,\r\nbeyond controversy, that the old notion that the general level of the\r\nsea remains permanent, and that the changes must be all attributed to\r\nthe land is wholly incorrect, and that the sea, as well as the land,\r\nis subject to changes of level, it is certainly quite legitimate to\r\nconsider whether the last elevation of the sea-level relatively to the\r\nland may not have resulted from the rising of the sea rather than from\r\nthe sinking of the land, in short, whether it may not be attributed\r\nto the cause we are now considering. The fact that those raised\r\nbeaches and terraces are found at so many different heights, and also\r\nso discontinuously along our coasts, might be urged as an objection\r\nto the opinion that they were due to changes in the level of the sea\r\nitself. Space will not permit me to enter upon the discussion of this\r\npoint at present; but it may be stated that this objection is more\r\napparent than real. It by no means follows that beaches of the same\r\nage must be at the same level. This has been shown very clearly by Mr.\r\nW. Pengelly in a paper on “Raised Beaches,” read before the British\r\nAssociation at Nottingham, 1866.\r\n\r\nWe have, as I think, evidence amounting to almost absolute certainty\r\nthat 11,700 years ago the general sea-level on the northern hemisphere\r\nmust have been higher than at present. And in order to determine the\r\nquestion of the 25-foot beach, we have merely to consider whether a\r\nrise to something like this extent probably took place at the period in\r\nquestion. We have at present no means of determining the exact extent\r\nof the rise which must have taken place at that period, for we cannot\r\ntell what quantity of ice was then melted off the antarctic regions.\r\nBut we have the means of making a very rough estimate, which, at least,\r\nmay enable us to determine whether a rise of some 20 or 30 feet may not\r\npossibly have taken place.\r\n\r\nIf we assume that the southern ice-cap extends on an average down\r\nto lat. 70°, we shall have an area equal to 1/33·163 of the entire\r\nsurface of the globe. The proportion of land to that of water, taking\r\ninto account the antarctic continent, is as 526 to 1272. The southern\r\nice-cap will therefore be equal to 1/23·46 of the area covered by\r\nwater. The density of ice to that of water being taken at ·92 to 1,\r\nit follows that 25 feet 6 inches of ice melted from off the face of\r\nthe antarctic continent would raise the level of the ocean one foot.\r\nIf 470 feet were melted off—and this is by no means an extravagant\r\nsupposition, when we reflect that for every 18 pounds of ice presently\r\nmelted an additional pound or two pounds, or perhaps more, would then\r\nbe melted, and that for many ages in succession—the water thus produced\r\nfrom the melted ice would raise the level of the sea 18 feet 5 inches.\r\nThe removal of the 470 feet of solid ice— which must be but a very\r\nsmall fraction of the total quantity of ice lying upon the antarctic\r\ncontinent—would shift the earth’s centre of gravity about 7 feet to the\r\nnorth of its present position. The shifting of the centre of gravity\r\nwould cause the sea to sink on the southern hemisphere and rise on the\r\nnorthern. And the quantity of water thus transferred from the southern\r\nhemisphere to the northern would carry the centre of gravity about one\r\nfoot further, and thus give a total displacement of the centre to the\r\nextent of about 8 feet. The sea would therefore rise about 8 feet at\r\nthe North Pole, and in the latitude of Edinburgh about 6 feet 7 inches.\r\nThis, added to the rise of 18 feet 5 inches, occasioned by the melting\r\nof the ice, would give 25 feet as the total rise in the latitude of\r\nScotland 11,700 years ago.\r\n\r\nEach square foot of surface at the poles 11,700 years ago would be\r\nreceiving 18,223,100 foot-pounds more of heat annually than at present.\r\nIf we deduct 22 per cent. as the amount absorbed in passing through the\r\natmosphere, we have 14,214,000 foot-pounds. This would be sufficient\r\nto melt 2·26 feet of ice. But if 50, instead of 22, per cent. were cut\r\noff, 1·45 cubic feet would be melted. In this case the 470 feet of ice\r\nwould be melted, independently of the effects of eccentricity, in about\r\n320 years. And supposing that only one-fourth part of the extra heat\r\nreached the ground, 470 feet of ice would be removed in about 640 years.\r\n\r\nAs to the exact time that the obliquity was at a maximum, previous\r\nto that of 11,700 years ago, our uncertainty is still greater. If we\r\nare permitted to assume that the ecliptic passes from its maximum to\r\nits minimum state and back to its maximum again with anything like\r\nuniformity, at the rate assigned by Leverrier and others, the obliquity\r\nwould not be far from a maximum about 60,000 years ago. Taking the\r\nrate of precession at 50″·21129, and assuming it to be uniform—which\r\nit probably is not—the winter solstice would be in the aphelion about\r\n61,300 years ago.[231] In short, it seems not at all improbable that\r\nat the time the solstice-point was in the aphelion, the obliquity of\r\nthe ecliptic would not be far from its maximum state. But at that time\r\nthe value of the eccentricity was 0·023, instead of 0·0187, its value\r\nat the last period. Consequently the rise of the sea would probably\r\nbe somewhat greater than it was 11,700 years ago. Might not this be\r\nthe period of the 40-foot beach? In this case 11,000 or 12,000 years\r\nwould be the age of the 25-foot beach, and 60,000 years the age of the\r\n40-foot beach.\r\n\r\nAbout 22,000 years ago, the winter solstice was in the perihelion, and\r\nas the eccentricity was then somewhat greater than it is at present,\r\nthe winters would be a little warmer and the climate more equable than\r\nit is at the present day. This perhaps might be the period of the\r\nsubmarine forests and lower peat-beds which underlie the Carse clays,\r\n_Scrobicularia_ mud, and other deposits belonging to the age of the\r\n25-foot beach. At any rate, it is perfectly certain that a condition\r\nof climate at this period prevailed exceedingly favourable to the\r\ngrowth of peat. It follows also that at this time, owing to a greater\r\naccumulation of ice on the southern hemisphere, the sea-level would be\r\na few feet lower than at present, and that forests and peat may have\r\nthen grown on places which are now under the sea-level.\r\n\r\nFor a few thousand years before and after 11,700 years ago, when the\r\nwinter solstice was evidently not far from the aphelion, and the sea\r\nstanding considerably above its present level, would probably, as we\r\nhave already stated, be the time when the Carse clays and other recent\r\ndeposits lying above the present level of the river were formed.\r\nAnd it is also a singular fact that the condition of things at that\r\nperiod must have been exceedingly favourable to the formation of\r\nsuch estuarine deposits; for at that time the winter temperature of\r\nour island, as has been already shown, would be considerably lower\r\nthan at present, and, consequently, during that season, snow, to a\r\nmuch larger extent than now, would fall instead of rain. The melting\r\nof the winter’s accumulation of snow on the approach of summer would\r\nnecessarily produce great floods, similar to what occur in the northern\r\nparts of Asia and America at the present day from this very same\r\ncause. The loose upper soil would be carried down by those floods and\r\ndeposited in the estuaries of our rivers.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing is a rough and imperfect sketch of the history of the\r\nclimate and the physical conditions of our globe for the past 60,000\r\nyears, in so far as physical and cosmical considerations seem to afford\r\nus information on the subject, and its striking agreement with that\r\nderived from geological sources is an additional evidence in favour\r\nof the opinion that geological and cosmical phenomena are physically\r\nrelated by a bond of causation.\r\n\r\n_Lieutenant-Colonel Drayson’s Theory of the Cause of the Glacial\r\nEpoch._—In a paper read before the Geological Society by\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Drayson, R.A., on the 22nd February, 1871,[232] that\r\nauthor states, that after calculating from the recorded positions of\r\nthe pole of the heavens during the last 2,000 years, he finds the pole\r\nof the ecliptic is not the centre of the circle traced by the pole of\r\nthe heavens. The pole of the heavens, he considers, describes a circle\r\nround a point 6° distant from the pole of the ecliptic and 29° 25′ 47″\r\nfrom the pole of the heavens, and that about 13,700 years b.c. the\r\nangular distance of the two poles was 35° 25′ 47″. This would bring\r\nthe Arctic Circle down to latitude 54° 34′ 13″ N. I fear that this is\r\na conclusion that will not be generally accepted by those familiar with\r\ncelestial mechanics. But, be this as it may, my present object is not\r\nto discuss the astronomical part of Colonel Drayson’s theory, but to\r\nconsider whether the conclusions which he deduces from his theory in\r\nregard to the cause of the glacial epoch be legitimate or not. Assuming\r\nfor argument’s sake that the obliquity of the ecliptic can possibly\r\nreach to 35° or 36°, so as to bring the Arctic Circle down to the\r\ncentre of England, would this account for the glacial epoch? Colonel\r\nDrayson concludes that the shifting of the Arctic Circle down to the\r\nlatitude of England would induce here a condition of climate similar\r\nto that which obtains in arctic regions. This seems to be the radical\r\nerror of the theory. It is perfectly true that were the Arctic Circle\r\nbrought down to latitude 54° 35′ part of our island would be in the\r\narctic regions, but it does not on that account follow that our island\r\nwould be subjected to an arctic climate.\r\n\r\nThe polar regions owe their cold not to the obliquity of the ecliptic,\r\nbut to their distance from the equator. Indeed were it not for\r\nobliquity those regions would be much colder than they really are,\r\nand an increase of obliquity, instead of increasing their cold, would\r\nreally make them warmer. The general effect of obliquity, as we\r\nhave seen, is to diminish the amount of heat received in equatorial\r\nand tropical regions, and to increase it in the polar and temperate\r\nregions. The greater the obliquity, and, consequently, the farther\r\nthe sun recedes from the equator, the smaller is the quantity of heat\r\nreceived by equatorial regions, and the greater the amount bestowed on\r\npolar and temperate regions. If, for example, we represent the present\r\namount of heat received from the sun at the equator on a given surface\r\nat 100 parts, 42·47 parts will then represent the amount received at\r\nthe poles on the same given surface. But were the obliquity increased\r\nto 35° the amount received at the equator would be reduced to 94·93\r\nparts, and that at the poles increased to 59·81; being an increase at\r\nthe poles of nearly one half. At latitude 60° the present quantity\r\nis equal to 57 parts; but about 63 parts would be received were the\r\nobliquity increased to 35°. It therefore follows that although the\r\nArctic Circle were brought down to the latitude of London so that the\r\nBritish islands would become a part of the arctic regions, the mean\r\ntemperature of these islands would not be lowered, but the reverse.\r\nThe winters would no doubt be colder than they are at present, but the\r\ncold of winter would be far more than compensated for by the heat of\r\nsummer. It is not a fair representation of the state of things, merely\r\nto say that an increase of obliquity tends to make the winters colder\r\nand the summers hotter, for it affects the summer heat far more than\r\nit does the winter cold. And the greater the obliquity the more does\r\nthe increase of heat during summer exceed the decrease during winter.\r\nThis is obvious because the greater the obliquity the greater the total\r\nannual amount of heat received.\r\n\r\nIf an increase of obliquity tended to produce an increase of ice in\r\ntemperate and polar regions, and thus to lead to a glacial epoch, then\r\nthe greater the obliquity the greater would be the tendency to produce\r\nsuch an effect. Conceive, then, the obliquity to go on increasing until\r\nit ultimately reached its absolute limit, 90°, and the earth’s axis to\r\ncoincide with the plane of the ecliptic. The Arctic Circle would then\r\nextend to the equator. Would this produce a glacial epoch? Certainly\r\nnot. A square foot of surface at the poles would then be receiving\r\nas much heat per annum as a square foot at the equator at present,\r\nsupposing the sun remained on the equator during the entire year. Less\r\nheat, however, would be reaching the equatorial regions than now. At\r\npresent, as we have just seen, the annual quantity of heat received at\r\neither pole is to that received at the equator as 42·47 to 100; but at\r\nthe period under consideration the poles would be actually obtaining\r\none-half more heat than the equator. The amount received per square\r\nfoot at the poles, to that received per square foot at the equator,\r\nwould be in the ratio of half the circumference of a circle to its\r\ndiameter, or as 1·5708 to 1. But merely to say that the poles would be\r\nreceiving more heat per annum than the equator is at present, does not\r\nconvey a correct idea of the excessive heat which the poles would then\r\nhave to endure; for it must be borne in mind that the heat reaching\r\nthe equator is spread over the whole year, whereas the poles would get\r\ntheir total amount during the six months of their summer. Consequently,\r\nfor six months in the year the poles would be obtaining far more than\r\ndouble the quantity of heat received at present by the equator during\r\nthe same length of time, and more than three times the quantity then\r\nreceived by the equator. The amount reaching the pole during the six\r\nmonths to that reaching the equator would be as 3·1416 to 1.\r\n\r\nAt the equator twelve hours’ darkness alternates with twelve hours’\r\nsunshine, and this prevents the temperature from rising excessively\r\nhigh; but at the poles it would be continuous sunshine for six months\r\nwithout the ground having an opportunity of cooling for a single\r\nhour. At the summer solstice, when the sun would be in the zenith of\r\nthe pole, the amount of heat received there every twenty-four hours\r\nwould actually be nearly three-and-a-quarter times greater than that\r\npresently received at the equator. Now what holds true with regard to\r\nthe poles would hold equally true, though to a lesser extent, of polar\r\nand temperate regions. We can form but a very inadequate idea of the\r\ncondition of things which would result from such an enormous increase\r\nof heat. Nothing living on the face of the globe could exist in polar\r\nregions under so fearful a temperature as would then prevail during\r\nsummer months. How absurd would it be to suppose that this condition\r\nof things would tend to produce a glacial epoch! Not only would every\r\nparticle of ice in polar regions be dissipated, but the very seas\r\naround the pole would be, for several months in the year, at the\r\nboiling point.\r\n\r\nIf it could be shown from _physical principles_—which, to say the\r\nleast, is highly improbable—that the obliquity of the ecliptic could\r\never have been as great as 35°, it would to a very considerable\r\nextent account for the comparative absence of ice in Greenland and\r\nother regions in high latitudes, such as we know was the case during\r\nthe Carboniferous, Miocene, and other periods. But although a great\r\nincrease of obliquity might cause a melting of the ice, yet it could\r\nnot produce that mild condition of climate which we know prevailed in\r\nhigh latitudes during those periods; while no increase of obliquity,\r\nhowever great, could in any way tend to produce a glacial epoch.\r\n\r\nColonel Drayson, however, seems to admit that this great increase of\r\nobliquity would make our summers much warmer than they are at present.\r\nHow, then, according to his theory, is the glacial epoch accounted for?\r\nThe following is the author’s explanation as stated in his own words:—\r\n\r\n“At the date 13,700 B.C. the same conditions appear to have prevailed\r\ndown to about 54° of latitude during winter as regards the sun being\r\nonly a few degrees above the horizon. We are, then, warranted in\r\nconcluding that the same climate prevailed down to 54° of latitude as\r\nnow exists in winter down to 67° of latitude.\r\n\r\n“Thus in the greater part of England and Wales, and in the whole of\r\nScotland, icebergs of large size would be _formed each winter_; every\r\nriver and stream would be frozen and blocked with ice, the whole\r\ncountry would be covered with a mantle of snow and ice, and those\r\ncreatures which could neither migrate nor endure the cold of an arctic\r\nclimate would be exterminated.”—“The Last Glacial Epoch,” p. 146.\r\n\r\n“At the summer solstice the midday altitude of the sun for the latitude\r\n54° would be about 71½°, an altitude equal to that which the sun\r\nnow attains in the south of Italy, the south of Spain, and in all\r\nlocalities having a latitude of about 40°.”\r\n\r\n“There would, however, be this singular difference from present\r\nconditions, that in latitude 54° the sun at the period of the summer\r\nsolstice would remain the whole twenty-four hours above the horizon;\r\na fact which would give extreme heat to those very regions which, six\r\nmonths previously, had been subjected to an arctic cold. Not only\r\nwould this greatly increased heat prevail in the latitude of 54°, but\r\nthe sun’s altitude would be 12° greater at midday in midsummer, and\r\nalso 12° greater at midnight in high northern latitudes, than it\r\never attains now; consequently the heat would be far greater than at\r\npresent, and high northern regions, even around the pole itself, would\r\nbe subjected to a heat during summer far greater than any which now\r\never exists in those localities. The natural consequence would be, that\r\nthe icebergs and ice which had during the severe winter accumulated in\r\nhigh latitudes would be rapidly thawed by this heat” (p. 148).\r\n\r\n“Each winter the whole northern and southern hemispheres would be one\r\nmass of ice; each summer nearly the whole of the ice of each hemisphere\r\nwould be melted and dispersed” (p. 150).\r\n\r\nAccording to this theory, not only is the whole country covered each\r\nwinter with a continuous mass of ice, but large icebergs are formed\r\nduring that short season, and when the summer heat sets in all is\r\nmelted away. Here we have a misapprehension not only as to the actual\r\ncondition of things during the glacial epoch, but even as to the way\r\nin which icebergs and land-ice are formed. Icebergs are formed from\r\nland-ice, but land-ice is not formed during a single winter, much\r\nless a mass of sufficient thickness to produce icebergs. Land-ice of\r\nthis thickness requires the accumulated snows of centuries for its\r\nproduction. All that we could really have, according to this theory,\r\nwould be a thick covering of snow during winter, which would entirely\r\ndisappear during summer, so that there could be no land-ice.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Thomas Belt’s Theory._—The theory that the glacial epoch resulted\r\nfrom a great increase in the obliquity of the ecliptic has recently\r\nbeen advocated by Mr. Thomas Belt.[233] His conceptions on the subject,\r\nhowever, appear to me to be even more irreconcilable with physics than\r\nthose we have been considering. Lieutenant-Colonel Drayson admits that\r\nthe increase of heat to polar regions resulting from the great increase\r\nof obliquity would dissipate the ice there, but Mr. Belt does not even\r\nadmit that an increase of obliquity would bring with it an increase of\r\nheat, far less that it would melt the polar ice. On the contrary, he\r\nmaintains that the tendency of obliquity is to increase the rigour of\r\npolar climate, and that this is the reason “that now around the poles\r\nsome lands are being glaciated, for excepting for that obliquity snow\r\nand ice would not accumulate, excepting on mountain chains.” “Thus,”\r\nhe says, “there exist glacial conditions at present around the poles,\r\ndue primarily to the obliquity of the ecliptic.” And he also maintains\r\nthat if there were no obliquity and the earth’s axis were perpendicular\r\nto the plane of its orbit, an eternal “spring would reign around the\r\narctic circle,” and that “under such circumstances the piling up of\r\nsnow, or even its production at the sea-level, would be impossible,\r\nexcepting perhaps in the immediate neighbourhood of the poles, where\r\nthe rays of the sun would have but little heating power from its small\r\naltitude.”\r\n\r\nMr. Belt has apparently been led to these strange conclusions by the\r\nfollowing singular misapprehension of the effects of obliquity on\r\nthe distribution of the sun’s heat over the globe. “The obliquity of\r\nthe ecliptic,” he remarks, “_does not affect the mean amount of heat\r\nreceived at any one point from the sun_, but it causes the heat and the\r\ncold to predominate at different seasons of the year.”\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to dwell further on the absurdity of the\r\nsupposition that an increase of obliquity can possibly account for the\r\nglacial epoch, but we may in a few words consider whether a decrease\r\nof obliquity would mitigate the climate and remove the snow from\r\npolar regions. Supposing obliquity to disappear and the earth’s axis\r\nto become perpendicular to the plane of its orbit, it is perfectly\r\ntrue that day and night would be equal all over the globe, but then\r\nthe quantity of heat received by the polar regions would be far less\r\nthan at present. It is well known that at present at the equinoxes,\r\nwhen day and night are equal, snow and not rain prevails in the arctic\r\nregions, and can we suppose it could be otherwise in the case under\r\nconsideration? How, we may well ask, could these regions, deprived of\r\ntheir summer, get rid of their snow and ice?\r\n\r\nBut even supposing it could be shown that a change in the obliquity of\r\nthe ecliptic to the extent assumed by Mr. Belt and Lieutenant-Colonel\r\nDrayson would produce a glacial epoch, still the assumption of such a\r\nchange is one which physical astronomy will not permit. Mr. Belt does\r\nnot appear to dispute the accuracy of the methods by which it is proved\r\nthat the variations of obliquity are confined within narrow limits; but\r\nhe maintains that physical astronomers, in making their calculations\r\nhave left out of account some circumstances which materially affect the\r\nproblem. These, according to Mr. Belt, are the following:—(1) Upheavals\r\nand subsidences of the land which may have taken place in past ages.\r\n(2) The unequal distribution of sea and land on the globe. (3) The fact\r\nthat the equatorial protuberance is not a regular one, “but approaches\r\nin a general outline to an ellipse, of which the greater diameter is\r\ntwo miles longer than the other.” (4) The heaping up of ice around the\r\npoles during the glacial period.\r\n\r\nWe may briefly consider whether any or all of these can sensibly affect\r\nthe question at issue. In reference to the last-mentioned element, it\r\nis no doubt true that if an immense quantity of water were removed\r\nfrom the ocean and placed around the poles in the form of ice it would\r\naffect the obliquity of the ecliptic; but this is an element of change\r\nwhich is not available to Mr. Belt, because according to his theory\r\nthe piling up of the ice is an effect which results from the change of\r\nobliquity.\r\n\r\nIn reference to the difference of two miles in the equatorial diameters\r\nof the earth, the fact must be borne in mind that the longer diameter\r\npasses through nearly the centre of the great depression of the Pacific\r\nOcean,[234] whereas the shorter diameter passes through the opposite\r\ncontinents of Asia and America. Now, when we take into consideration\r\nthe fact that these continents are not only two-and-a-half times denser\r\nthan the ocean, but have a mean elevation of about 1,000 feet above\r\nthe sea-level, it becomes perfectly obvious that the earth’s mass must\r\nbe pretty evenly distributed around its axis of rotation, and that\r\ntherefore the difference in the equatorial diameters can exercise no\r\nappreciable effect on the change of obliquity. It follows also that the\r\npresent arrangement of sea and land is the best that could be chosen to\r\nprevent disturbance of motion.\r\n\r\nThat there ever were upheavals and depressions of the land of so\r\nenormous a magnitude as to lead to a change of obliquity to the extent\r\nassumed by Lieutenant-Colonel Drayson and Mr. Belt is what, I presume,\r\nfew geologists would be willing to admit. Suppose the great table-land\r\nof Thibet, with the Himalaya Mountains, were to sink under the sea,\r\nit would hardly produce any sensible effect on the obliquity of the\r\necliptic. Nay more; supposing that all the land in the globe were sunk\r\nunder the sea-level, or the ocean beds converted into dry land, still\r\nthis would not materially affect obliquity. The reason is very obvious.\r\nThe equatorial bulge is so immense that those upheavals and depressions\r\nwould not to any great extent alter the oblate form of the earth. The\r\nonly cause which could produce any sensible effect on obliquity, as has\r\nalready been noticed, would be the removal of the water of the ocean\r\nand the piling of it up in the form of ice around the poles; but this\r\nis a cause which is not available to Mr. Belt.\r\n\r\n_Sir Charles Lyell’s Theory._—I am also unable to agree with Sir\r\nCharles Lyell’s conclusions in reference to the influence of the\r\nobliquity of the ecliptic on climate. Sir Charles says, “It may be\r\nremarked that if the obliquity of the ecliptic could ever be diminished\r\nto the extent of four degrees below its present inclination, such a\r\ndeviation would be of geological interest, in so far as it would cause\r\nthe sun’s light to be disseminated over a broader zone inside of the\r\narctic and antarctic circles. Indeed, if the date of its occurrence in\r\npast time could be ascertained, this greater spread of the solar rays,\r\nimplying a shortening of the polar night, might help in some slight\r\ndegree to account for a vegetation such as now characterizes lower\r\nlatitudes, having had in the Miocene and Carboniferous periods a much\r\nwider range towards the pole.”[235]\r\n\r\nThe effects, as we have seen, would be directly the reverse of what is\r\nhere stated, viz., the more the obliquity was diminished the _less_\r\nwould the sun’s rays spread over the arctic and antarctic regions, and\r\nconversely the more the obliquity was increased the _greater_ would\r\nbe the amount of heat spread over polar latitudes. The farther the\r\nsun recedes from the equator, the greater becomes the amount of heat\r\ndiffused over the polar regions; and if the obliquity could possibly\r\nattain its absolute limit (90°), it is obvious that the poles would\r\nthen be receiving more heat than the equator is now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\n                   COAL AN INTER-GLACIAL FORMATION.\r\n\r\n  Climate of Coal Period Inter-glacial in Character.—Coal Plants\r\n      indicate an Equable, not a Tropical Climate.—Conditions\r\n      necessary for Preservation of Coal Plants.—Oscillations\r\n      of Sea-level necessarily implied.—Why our Coal-fields\r\n      contain more than One Coal-seam.—Time required to form a\r\n      Bed of Coal.—Why Coal Strata contain so little evidence of\r\n      Ice-action.—Land Flat during Coal Period.—Leading Idea of the\r\n      Theory.—Carboniferous Limestones.\r\n\r\n\r\n_An Inter-glacial Climate the one best suited for the Growth of the\r\nCoal Plants._—No assertion, perhaps, could appear more improbable,\r\nor is more opposed to all hitherto received theories, than the one\r\nthat the plants which form our coal grew during a glacial epoch. But,\r\nnevertheless, if the theory of secular changes of climate, discussed\r\nin the foregoing chapters, be correct, we have in warm inter-glacial\r\nperiods (as was pointed out several years ago)[236] the very condition\r\nof climate best suited for the growth of those kinds of trees and\r\nvegetation of which our coal is composed. It is the generally received\r\nopinion among both geologists and botanists that the flora of the Coal\r\nperiod does not indicate the existence of a tropical, but a moist,\r\nequable, and temperate climate. “It seems to have become,” says Sir\r\nCharles Lyell, “a more and more received opinion that the coal plants\r\ndo not on the whole indicate a climate resembling that now enjoyed in\r\nthe equatorial zone. Tree-ferns range as far south as the southern\r\nparts of New Zealand, and Araucanian pines occur in Norfolk Island.\r\nA great preponderance of ferns and lycopodiums indicates moisture,\r\nequability of temperature, and freedom from frost, rather than intense\r\nheat.”[237]\r\n\r\nMr. Robert Brown, the eminent botanist, considers that the rapid and\r\ngreat growth of many of the coal plants showed that they grew in swamps\r\nand shallow water of equable and genial temperature.\r\n\r\n“Generally speaking,” says Professor Page, “we find them resembling\r\nequisetums, marsh-grasses, reeds, club-mosses, tree-ferns, and\r\nconiferous trees; and these in existing nature attain their maximum\r\ndevelopment in warm, temperate, and subtropical, rather than in\r\nequatorial regions. The Wellingtonias of California and the pines of\r\nNorfolk Island are more gigantic than the largest coniferous tree yet\r\ndiscovered in the coal-measures.”[238]\r\n\r\nThe Coal period was not only characterized by a great preponderance\r\nover the present in the quantity of ferns growing, but also in the\r\nnumber of different species. Our island possesses only about 50\r\nspecies, while no fewer than 140 species have been enumerated as having\r\ninhabited those few isolated places in England over which the coal has\r\nbeen worked. And Humboldt has shown that it is not in the hot, but in\r\nthe mountainous, humid, and shady parts of the equatorial regions that\r\nthe family of ferns produces the greatest number of species.\r\n\r\n“Dr. Hooker thinks that a climate warmer than ours now is, would\r\nprobably be indicated by the presence of an increased number of\r\nflowering plants, which would doubtless have been fossilized with\r\nthe ferns; whilst a lower temperature, _equal to the mean of the\r\nseasons now prevailing_, would assimilate our climate to that of such\r\ncooler countries as are characterized by a disproportionate amount of\r\nferns.”[239]\r\n\r\n“The general opinion of the highest authorities,” says Professor Hull,\r\n“appears to be that the climate did not resemble that of the equatorial\r\nregions, but was one in which the temperature was free from extremes;\r\nthe atmosphere being warm and moist, somewhat resembling that of New\r\nZealand and the surrounding islands, which we endeavour to imitate\r\nartificially in our hothouses.”[240]\r\n\r\nThe enormous quantity of the carboniferous vegetation shows also that\r\nthe climate under which it grew could not have been of a tropical\r\ncharacter, or it must have been decomposed by the heat. Peat, so\r\nabundant in temperate regions, is not to be found in the tropics.\r\n\r\nThe condition most favourable to the preservation of vegetable remains,\r\nat least under the form of peat, is a cool, moist, and equable climate,\r\nsuch as prevails in the Falkland Islands at the present day. “In these\r\nislands,” says Mr. Darwin, “almost every kind of plant, even the coarse\r\ngrass which covers the whole surface of the land, becomes converted\r\ninto this substance.”[241]\r\n\r\nFrom the evidence of geology we may reasonably infer that were\r\nthe difference between our summer and winter temperature nearly\r\nannihilated, and were we to enjoy an equable climate equal to, or\r\nperhaps a little above, the present mean annual temperature of our\r\nisland, we should then have a climate similar to what prevailed during\r\nthe Carboniferous epoch.\r\n\r\nBut we have already seen that such must have been the character of our\r\nclimate at the time that the eccentricity of the earth’s orbit was at\r\na maximum, and winter occurred when the earth was in the perihelion of\r\nits orbit. For, as we have already shown, the earth would in such a\r\ncase be 14,212,700 miles nearer to the sun in winter than in summer.\r\nThis enormous difference, along with other causes which have been\r\ndiscussed, would almost extinguish the difference between summer and\r\nwinter temperature. The almost if not entire absence of ice and snow,\r\nresulting from this condition of things, would, as has already been\r\nshown, tend to raise the mean annual temperature of the climate higher\r\nthan it is at present.\r\n\r\n_Conditions necessary for the Preservation of the Coal Plants._—But\r\nin order to the formation of coal, it is not simply necessary to have\r\na condition of climate suitable for the growth, but also for the\r\npreservation, of a luxuriant vegetation. The very existence of coal is\r\nas much due to the latter circumstance as to the former; nay more, as\r\nwe shall yet see, the fact that a greater amount of coal belongs to the\r\nCarboniferous period than to any other, was evidently due not so much\r\nto a more extensive vegetable growth during that age, suited to form\r\ncoal, as to the fact that that flora has been better preserved. Now,\r\nas will be presently shown, we have not merely in the warm periods of\r\na glacial epoch a condition of climate best suited for the growth of\r\ncoal plants, but we have also in the cold periods of such an epoch the\r\ncondition most favourable for the preservation of those plants.\r\n\r\nOne circumstance necessary for the preservation of plants is that they\r\nshould have been covered over by a thick deposit of sand, mud, or clay,\r\nand for this end it is necessary that the area upon which the plants\r\ngrew should have become submerged. It is evident that unless the area\r\nhad become submerged, the plants could not have been covered over with\r\na thick deposit; and, even supposing they had been covered over, they\r\ncould not have escaped destruction from subaërial denudation unless\r\nthe whole had been under water. Another condition favourable, if not\r\nessential, to the preservation of the plants, is that they should have\r\nbeen submerged in a cold and not in a warm sea. Assuming that the\r\ncoal plants grew during a warm period of a glacial epoch, we have in\r\nthe cold period which succeeded all the above conditions necessarily\r\nsecured.\r\n\r\nIt is now generally admitted that the coal trees grew near broad\r\nestuaries and on immense flat plains but little elevated above\r\nsea-level. But that the _Lepidodendra_, _Sigillariæ_, and other trees,\r\nof which our coal is almost wholly composed, grew on dry ground,\r\nelevated above sea-level, and not in swamps and shallow water, as\r\nwas at one time supposed, has been conclusively established by the\r\nresearches of Principal Dawson and others. After the growth of many\r\ngenerations of trees, the plain is eventually submerged under the sea,\r\nand the whole, through course of time, becomes covered over with thick\r\ndeposits of sand, gravel, and other sediments carried down by streams\r\nfrom the adjoining land. After this the submerged plain becomes again\r\nelevated above the sea-level, and forms the site of a second forest,\r\nwhich, after continuing to flourish for long centuries, is in turn\r\ndestroyed by submergence, and, like the former, becomes covered over\r\nwith deposits from the land. This alternate process of submergence\r\nand emergence goes on till we have a succession of buried forests\r\none above another, with immense stratified deposits between. These\r\nburied forests ultimately become converted into beds of coal. This,\r\nI presume, is a fair representation of the generally admitted way in\r\nwhich our coal-beds had their origin. It is also worthy of notice that\r\nthe stratified beds between the coal-seams are of marine and not of\r\nlacustrine origin. On this point I may quote the opinion of Professor\r\nHull, a well-known authority on the subject: “Whilst admitting,” he\r\nsays, “the occasional presence of lacustrine strata associated with the\r\ncoal-measures, I think we may conclude that the whole formation has\r\nbeen essentially of marine and estuarine origin.”[242]\r\n\r\n_Coal-beds necessarily imply Oscillations of Sea-level._—It may also\r\nbe observed that each coal-seam indicates both an elevation and a\r\ndepression of the land. If, for example, there are six coal-seams,\r\none above the other, this proves that the land must have been, at\r\nleast, six times below and six times above sea-level. This repeated\r\noscillation of the land has been regarded as a somewhat puzzling and\r\nsingular circumstance. But if we assume coal to be an inter-glacial\r\nformation, this difficulty not only disappears, but all the various\r\ncircumstances which we have been detailing are readily explained.\r\nWe have to begin with a warm inter-glacial period, with a climate\r\nspecially suited for the growth of the coal trees. During this period,\r\nas has been shown in the chapter on Submergence, the sea would be\r\nstanding at a lower level than at present, laying bare large tracts\r\nof sea-bottom, on which would flourish the coal vegetation. This\r\ncondition of things would continue for a period of 8,000 or 10,000\r\nyears, allowing the growth of many generations of trees. When the warm\r\nperiod came to a close, and the cold and glacial condition set in, the\r\nclimate became unsuited for the growth of the coal plants. The sea\r\nwould begin to rise, and the old sea-bottoms on which, during so long\r\na period, the forests grew, would be submerged and become covered by\r\nsedimentary deposits brought down from the land. These forests becoming\r\nsubmerged in a cold sea, and buried under an immense mass of sediment,\r\nwere then now protected from destruction, and in a position to become\r\nconverted into coal. The cold continuing for a period of 10,000 years,\r\nor thereby, would be succeeded by another warm period, during which the\r\nsubmerged areas became again a land-surface, on which a second forest\r\nflourished for another 10,000 years, which in turn became submerged\r\nand buried under drift on the approach of the second cold period.\r\nThis alternate process of submergence and emergence of the land,\r\ncorresponding to the rise and fall of sea-level during the cold and\r\nwarm periods, would continue so long as the eccentricity of the earth’s\r\norbit remained at a high value, till we might have, perhaps, five or\r\nsix submerged forests, one above the other, and separated by great\r\nthicknesses of stratified deposits, these submerged forests being the\r\ncoal-beds of the present day.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 10.]\r\n\r\nIt is probable that the forests of the Coal period would extend inland\r\nover the country, but only such portions as were slightly elevated\r\nabove sea-level would be submerged and covered over by sediment and\r\nthus be preserved, and ultimately become coal-seams. The process will\r\nbe better understood from the following diagram. Let A B represent the\r\nsurface of the ground prior to a glacial epoch, and to the formation\r\nof the beds of coal and stratified deposits represented in the\r\ndiagram. Let S S′ be the normal sea-level. Suppose the eccentricity\r\nof the earth’s orbit begins to increase, and the winter solstice\r\napproaches the perihelion, we have then a moderately warm period. The\r\nsea-level sinks to 1, and forests of sigillariæ and other coal trees\r\ncover the country from the sea-shore at 1, stretching away inland in\r\nthe direction of B. In course of time the winter solstice moves round\r\nto aphelion and a cold period follows. The sea begins to rise and\r\ncontinues rising till it reaches 1′. Denudation and the severity of\r\nthe climate destroy every vestige of the forest from 1′ backwards into\r\nthe interior; but the portion 1 1′ being submerged and covered over\r\nby sediment brought down from the land is preserved. The eccentricity\r\ncontinuing to increase in extent, the second inter-glacial period is\r\nmore warm and equable than the first, and the sea this time sinks to 2.\r\nA second forest now covers the country down to the sea-shore at 2. This\r\nsecond warm period is followed by the second cold period, more severe\r\nthan the first, and the sea-level rises to 2′. Denudation and severity\r\nof climate now destroy every remnant of the forest, from 2′ inland,\r\nbut of course the submerged portion of 2 2′, like the former portion 1\r\n1′, is preserved. During the third warm period (the eccentricity being\r\nstill on the increase) the sea-level sinks to 3, and the country for\r\nthe third time is covered by forests, which extend down to 3. This\r\nthird warm period is followed by a cold glacial period more severe than\r\nthe preceding, and the sea-level rises to 3′, and the submerged portion\r\nof the forest from 3 to 3′ becomes covered with drift,—the rest as\r\nbefore being destroyed by denudation and the severity of the climate.\r\nWe shall assume that the eccentricity has now reached a maximum, and\r\nthat during the fourth inter-glacial period the sea-level sinks only to\r\n4, the level to which it sank during the second inter-glacial period.\r\nThe country is now covered for the fourth time by forests. The cold\r\nperiod which succeeds not being so severe as the last, the sea rises\r\nonly to 4′, which, of course, marks the limit of the fourth forest. The\r\neccentricity continuing to diminish, the fifth forest is only submerged\r\nup to 5′, and the sixth and last one up to 6′. The epoch of cold and\r\nwarm periods being now at a close, the sea-level remains stationary at\r\nits old normal position S S′. Here we have six buried forests, the one\r\nabove the other, which, through course of ages, become transformed into\r\ncoal-beds.\r\n\r\nIt does not, however, necessarily follow that each separate coal-seam\r\nrepresents a warm period. It is quite possible that two or more seams\r\nseparated from each other by thin partings or a few feet of sedimentary\r\nstrata might have been formed during one warm period; for during a warm\r\nperiod minor oscillations of sea-level sufficient to submerge the land\r\nto some depth might quite readily have taken place from the melting of\r\npolar ice, as was shown in the chapter on Submergence.\r\n\r\nIt may be noticed that in order to make the section more distinct, its\r\nthickness has been greatly exaggerated. It will also be observed that\r\nbeds 4, 5, and 6 extend considerably to the left of what is represented\r\nin the section.\r\n\r\nBut it is not to be supposed that the whole phenomena of the\r\ncoal-fields can be explained without supposing a subsidence of the\r\nland. The great depth to which the coal-beds have been sunk, in many\r\ncases, must be attributed to a subsidence of the level. A series of\r\nbeds formed during a glacial epoch, may, owing to a subsidence of the\r\nland, be sunk to a great depth, and become covered over with thousands\r\nof feet of sediment; and then on the occurrence of another glacial\r\nepoch, a new series of coal-beds may be formed on the surface. Thus\r\nthe upper series may be separated from the lower by thousands of feet\r\nof sedimentary rock. There is another consequence resulting from the\r\nsinking of the land, which must be taken into account. Had there been\r\nno sinking of the land during the Carboniferous age, the quantity of\r\ncoal-beds now remaining would be far less than it actually is, for it\r\nis in a great measure owing to their being sunk to a great depth that\r\nthey have escaped destruction by the enormous amount of denudation\r\nwhich has taken place since that remote age. It therefore follows that\r\nonly a very small fraction of the submerged forests of the Coal period\r\ndo actually now exist in the form of coal. Generally it would only be\r\nthose areas which happened to be sunk to a considerable depth, by a\r\nsubsidence of the land, that would escape destruction from denudation.\r\nBut no doubt the areas which would thus be preserved bear but a small\r\nproportion to those destroyed.\r\n\r\n_Length of Inter-glacial Period, as indicated by the Thickness of a\r\nBed of Coal._—A fact favourable to the idea that the coal-seams were\r\nformed during inter-glacial periods is, that the length of those\r\nperiods agrees pretty closely with the length of time supposed to be\r\nrequired to form a coal-seam of average thickness. Other things being\r\nequal, the thickness of a coal-seam would depend upon the length\r\nof the inter-glacial period. If the rate of precession and motion\r\nof the perihelion were always uniform the periods would all be of\r\nequal length. But although the rate of precession is not subject to\r\nmuch variation, such is not the case in regard to the motion of the\r\nperihelion, as will be seen from the tables of the longitude of the\r\nperihelion given in Chapter XIX. Sometimes the motion of the perihelion\r\nis rapid, at other times slow, while in some cases its motion is\r\nretrograde. In consequence of this, an inter-glacial period may not be\r\nmore than some six or seven thousand years in length, while in other\r\ncases its length may be as much as fifteen or sixteen thousand years.\r\n\r\nAccording to Boussingault, luxuriant vegetation at the present day\r\ntakes from the atmosphere about a half ton of carbon per acre\r\nannually, or fifty tons per acre in a century. Fifty tons of carbon of\r\nthe specific gravity of coal, about 1·5, spread evenly over the surface\r\nof an acre, would make a layer nearly one-third of an inch.[243]\r\nHumboldt makes the estimate a little higher, viz., one half-inch.\r\nTaking the latter estimate, it would require 7,200 years to form a\r\nbed of coal a yard thick. Dr. Heer, of Zurich, thinks that it would\r\nnot require more than 1,400 years to form a bed of coal one yard\r\nthick;[244] while Mr. Maclaren thinks that a bed of coal one yard thick\r\nwould be formed in 1,000 years.[245] Professor Phillip, calculating\r\nfrom the amount of carbon taken from the atmosphere, as determined by\r\nLiebig, considers that if it were converted into ordinary coal with\r\nabout 75 per cent. of carbon, it would yield one inch in 127·5 years,\r\nor a yard in 4,600 years.[246]\r\n\r\nThere is here a considerable amount of difference in regard to the time\r\nrequired to form a yard of coal. The truth, however, may probably be\r\nsomewhere between the two extremes, and we may assume 5,000 years to be\r\nabout the time. In a warm period of 15,000 years we should then have\r\ndeposited a seam of coal 9 feet thick, while during a warm period of\r\n7,000 years we would have a seam of only 4 feet.\r\n\r\n_Reason why the Coal Strata present so little Evidence of\r\nIce-action._—There are two objections which will, no doubt, present\r\nthemselves to the reader’s mind. (1.) If coal be an inter-glacial\r\nformation, why do the coal strata present so little evidence of\r\nice-action? If the coal-seams represent warm inter-glacial periods, the\r\nintervening beds must represent cold or glacial periods, and if so,\r\nthey ought to contain more abundant evidence of ice-action than they\r\nreally do. (2.) In the case of the glacial epoch, almost every vestige\r\nof the vegetation of the warm periods was destroyed by the ice of the\r\ncold periods; why then did not the same thing take place during the\r\nglacial epoch of the Carboniferous period?\r\n\r\nDuring the glacial epoch the face of the country was in all\r\nprobability covered for ages with the most luxuriant vegetation; but\r\nscarcely a vestige of that vegetation now remains, indeed the very soil\r\nupon which it grew is not to be found. All that now remains is the\r\nwreck and desolation produced by the ice-sheet that covered the country\r\nduring the cold periods of that epoch, consisting of transported blocks\r\nof stones, polished and grooved rocks, and a confused mass of boulder\r\nclay. Here we have in this epoch nothing tangible presenting itself\r\nbut the destructive effects of the ice which swept over the land. Why,\r\nthen, in reference to the glacial epochs of the Carboniferous age\r\nshould we have such abundant evidence of the vegetation of the warm\r\nperiods, and yet so little evidence of the effect of the ice of the\r\ncold periods? The answer to these two objections will go a great way\r\nto explain why we have so much coal belonging to the Carboniferous\r\nage, and so little belonging to any other age; and it will, I think,\r\nbe found in the peculiar physical character of the country during\r\nthe Carboniferous age. The areas on which the forests of the Coal\r\nperiod grew escaped the destructive power of glaciers and land-ice on\r\naccount of the flat nature of the ground. There are few points on which\r\ngeologists are more unanimous than in regard to the flat character of\r\nthe country during the Coal period.\r\n\r\nThere does not seem to be any very satisfactory evidence that the\r\ninterior of the country rose to any very great elevation. Mr.\r\nGodwin-Austen thinks that during the Coal period there must have\r\nbeen “a vast expanse of continuous horizontal surface at very slight\r\nelevations above the sea-level.”[247] Of the widely spread terrestrial\r\nsurface of the Coal-measure period, portions, he believes, attained\r\na considerable elevation. But in contrast to this he states, “There\r\nis a feature which seems to distinguish this period physically from\r\nall subsequent periods, and which consists in the vast expanse of\r\ncontinuous horizontal surface which the land area presented, bordering\r\non, and at very slight elevations above, the sea-level.”[248] Hugh\r\nMiller, describing in his usual graphic way the appearance of the\r\ncountry during the Coal period, says:—“It seems to have been a land\r\nconsisting of immense flats, unvaried, mayhap, by a _single hill_,\r\nin which dreary swamps, inhabited by doleful creatures, spread out\r\non every hand for hundreds and thousands of miles; and a gigantic\r\nand monstrous vegetation formed, as I have shown, the only prominent\r\nfeatures of the scenery.”[249]\r\n\r\nNow, if this is in any way like a just representation of the general\r\nfeatures of the country during the Coal period, it was physically\r\nimpossible, no matter however severe the climate may have been,\r\nthat there could have been in this country at that period anything\r\napproaching to continental ice, or perhaps even to glaciers of such\r\ndimensions as would reach down to near the sea-level, where the coal\r\nvegetation now preserved is supposed chiefly to have grown. The\r\ncondition of things which would prevail would more probably resemble\r\nthat of Siberia than that of Greenland.\r\n\r\nThe absence of all traces of ice-action in the strata of the\r\ncoal-measures can in this case be easily explained. For as by\r\nsupposition there were no glaciers, there could have been no\r\nscratching, grooving, or polishing of the rocks; neither could there\r\nhave been any icebergs, for the large masses known as icebergs are\r\nthe terminal portions of glaciers which have reached down to the sea.\r\nAgain, there being no icebergs, there of course could have been no\r\ngrinding or scratching of the rocks forming the floor of the ocean.\r\nTrue, during summer, when the frozen sea broke up, we should then\r\nhave immense masses of floating ice, but these masses would not be of\r\nsufficient thickness to rub against the sea-bottom. But even supposing\r\nthat they did occasionally touch the bottom here and there, we could\r\nnot possibly find the evidence of this in any of the strata of the\r\ncoal-measures. We could not expect to find any scratchings or markings\r\non the sandstone or shale of those strata indicating the action of\r\nice, for at that period there were no beds of sandstone or shale, but\r\nsimply beds of sand and mud, which in future ages became consolidated\r\ninto sandstone and shale. A mass of ice might occasionally rub along\r\nthe sea-bottom, and leave its markings on the loose sand or soft mud\r\nforming that bottom, but the next wave that passed over it would\r\nobliterate every mark, and leave the surface as smooth as before.\r\nNeither could we expect to find any large erratics or boulders in the\r\ncoal strata, for these must come from the land, and as by supposition\r\nthere were no glaciers or land-ice at that period, there was therefore\r\nno means of transporting them. In Greenland the icebergs sometimes\r\ncarry large boulders, which are dropped into the sea as the icebergs\r\nmelt away; but these blocks have all either been transported on the\r\nbacks of glaciers from inland tracts, or have fallen on the field-ice\r\nalong the shore from the face of crags and overhanging precipices.\r\nBut as there were probably neither glaciers reaching to the sea, nor\r\nperhaps precipitous cliffs along the sea-shore, there could have been\r\nfew or no blocks transported by ice and dropped into the sea of the\r\nCarboniferous period, and of course we need not expect to find them in\r\nthe sandstone and shale which during that epoch formed the bed of the\r\nocean. There would no doubt be coast-line ice and ground-ice in rivers,\r\ncarrying away large quantities of gravel and stones; but these gravels\r\nand stones would of course be all water-worn, and although found in the\r\nstrata of the coal-measures, as no doubt they actually are, they would\r\nnot be regarded as indicating the action of ice. The simple absence of\r\nrelics of ice-action in the coal-measures proves nothing whatever in\r\nregard to whether there were cold periods during their formation or not.\r\n\r\nThis comparative absence of continental ice might be one reason why\r\nthe forests of the Carboniferous period have been preserved to a much\r\ngreater extent than those of any other age.\r\n\r\nIt must be observed, however, that the conclusions at which we have\r\narrived in reference to the comparative absence of continental ice\r\napplies only to the areas which now constitute our coal-fields. The\r\naccumulation of ice on the antarctic regions, and on some parts of\r\nthe arctic regions, might have been as great during that age as it\r\nis at present. Had there been no continental ice there could have\r\nbeen no such oscillations of sea-level as is assumed in the foregoing\r\ntheory. The leading idea of the theory, expressed in a few words,\r\nis, that the glacial epochs of the Carboniferous age were as severe,\r\nand the accumulation of ice as great, as during any other age, only\r\nthere were large tracts of flat country, but little elevated above the\r\nsea-level, which were not covered by ice. These plains, during the\r\nwarm inter-glacial periods, were covered with forests of sigillariæ\r\nand other coal trees. Portions of those forests were protected by the\r\nsubmergence which resulted from the rise of the sea-level during the\r\ncold or glacial periods and the subsequent subsidence of the land.\r\nThose portions now constitute our coal-beds.\r\n\r\nBut that coal may be an inter-glacial formation is no mere hypothesis,\r\nfor we have in the well-known Dürnten beds—described in Chapter XV.—an\r\nactual example of such a formation.\r\n\r\n_Carboniferous Limestones._—As a general rule the limestones of the\r\nCarboniferous period, like the coal, are found in beds separated by\r\nmasses of sandstone and other stratified deposits, which proves that\r\nthe corals, crinoids, and other creatures, of the remains of which it\r\nis composed, did not live continuously on during the entire Limestone\r\nperiod. These limestones are a marine formation. If the land was\r\nrepeatedly submerged the coal must of necessity have been produced in\r\nseams with stratified deposits between, but there is no reason why the\r\nsame should have been the case with the limestones. If the climatic\r\ncondition of the sea continued the same we should not have expected\r\nthis alternate succession of life and death; but, according to the\r\ntheory of alternate cold and warm periods, such a condition follows\r\nas a necessary consequence, for during the warm periods, when the\r\nland was covered with a luxuriant vegetation, the sea-bottom would be\r\ncovered with mollusca, crinoids, corals, &c., fitted to live only in a\r\nmoderately warm sea; but when the cold came on those creatures would\r\ndie, and their remains, during the continuance of the cold period,\r\nwould become slowly covered over with deposits of sand and clay. On the\r\nreturn of the warm period those deposits would soon become covered with\r\nlife as before, forming another bed of limestone, and this alternation\r\nof life and death would go on as long as the glacial epoch continued.\r\n\r\nIt is true that in Derbyshire, and in the south of Ireland and some\r\nother places, the limestone is found in one mass of several hundred\r\nfeet in thickness without any beds of sandstone or shale, but then it\r\nis nowhere found in one continuous mass from top to bottom without any\r\nlines of division. These breaks or divisions may as distinctly mark\r\na cold period as though they had been occupied by beds of sandstone.\r\nThe marine creatures ceased to exist, and when the rough surface left\r\nby their remains became smoothed down by the action of the waves into\r\na flat plain, another bed would begin to form upon this floor so\r\nsoon as life again appeared. Two agencies working together probably\r\nconspired to produce these enormous masses of limestone divided only\r\nby breaks marking different periods of elaboration. Corals grow in\r\nwarm seas, and there only in water of a depth ranging from 20 to 30\r\nfathoms. The cold of a period of glaciation would not only serve to\r\ndestroy them, but they would be submerged so much beyond the depth\r\nproper for their existence that even were it possible that with the\r\nsubmergence a sufficient temperature was left, they would inevitably\r\nperish from the superincumbent mass of water. We are therefore, as\r\nit seems to me, warranted in concluding that the separate masses of\r\nDerbyshire limestone were formed during warm inter-glacial periods,\r\nand that the lines of division represent cold periods of glaciation\r\nduring which the animals perished by the combined influence of cold and\r\npressure of water. The submergence of the coral banks in deep water on\r\na sea-bottom, which, like the land, was characteristically flat and\r\neven, implies its carrying away far into the bosom of the ocean, and\r\nconsequently remote from any continent and the river-borne detritus\r\nthereof.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\n    PATH OF THE ICE-SHEET IN NORTH-WESTERN EUROPE AND ITS RELATIONS\r\n                TO THE BOULDER CLAY OF CAITHNESS.[250]\r\n\r\n  Character of Caithness Boulder Clay.—Theories of the Origin\r\n      of the Caithness Clay.—Mr. Jamieson’s Theory.—Mr. C.

It is an unstratified clay, of a deep\r\ngrey or slaty colour, resembling much that of the Caithness flags on\r\nwhich it rests. It is thus described by Mr. Jamieson (Quart. Jour.\r\nGeol. Soc., vol. xxii., p. 261):—\r\n\r\n“The glacial drift of Caithness is particularly interesting as an\r\nexample of a boulder clay which in its mode of accumulation and\r\nice-scratched _débris_ very much resembles that unstratified stony mud\r\nwhich occurs underneath glaciers—the ‘_moraine profonde_,’ as some call\r\nit.\r\n\r\n“The appearance of the drift along the Haster Burn, and in many other\r\nplaces in Caithness, is in fact precisely the same as that of the old\r\nboulder clay of the rest of Scotland, except that it is charged with\r\nremains of sea-shells and other marine organisms.\r\n\r\n“If want of stratification, hardness of texture, and abundance of\r\nwell-glaciated stones and boulders are to be the tests for what we call\r\ngenuine boulder clay, then much of the Caithness drift will stand the\r\nordeal.”\r\n\r\nSo far, therefore, as the mere appearance of the drift is concerned,\r\nit would at once be pronounced to be true Lower Till, the product of\r\nland-ice. But there are two circumstances connected with it which have\r\nbeen generally regarded as fatal to this conclusion.\r\n\r\n(1) The striæ on the rocks show that the ice which formed the clay\r\nmust have come from the sea, and not from the interior of the country;\r\nfor their direction is almost at right angles to what it would have\r\nbeen had the ice come from the interior. Over the whole district, the\r\ndirection of the grooves and scratches, not only of the rocks but\r\neven of the stones in the clay, is pretty nearly N.W. and S.E. “When\r\nexamining the sections along the Haster Burn,” says Mr. Jamieson, “in\r\ncompany with Mr. Joseph Anderson, I remarked that the striæ on the\r\nimbedded fragments generally agreed in direction with those of the\r\nrocks beneath. The scratches on the boulders, as usual, run lengthways\r\nalong the stones when they are of an elongated form; and the position\r\nof these stones, as they lie imbedded in the drift, is, as a rule, such\r\nthat their longer axes point in the same direction as do the scratches\r\non the solid rock beneath; showing that the same agency that scored the\r\nrocks also ground and pushed along the drift.”\r\n\r\nMr. C. W. Peach informs me that he seldom or never found a stone with\r\ntwo sets of striæ on it, a fact indicating, as Mr. Jamieson remarks,\r\nthat the drift was produced by one great movement invariably in the\r\nsame direction. Let it be borne in mind that the ice, which thus moved\r\nover Caithness in this invariable track, must either have come from the\r\nAtlantic to the N.W., or from the Moray Firth to the S.E.\r\n\r\n(2) The boulder clay of Caithness is full of sea-shells and other\r\nmarine remains. The shells are in a broken condition, and are\r\ninterspersed like the stones through the entire mass of the clay.\r\nMr. Jamieson states that he nowhere observed any instance of shells\r\nbeing found in an undisturbed condition, “nor could I hear,” he says,\r\n“of any such having been found; there seems to be no such thing as a\r\nbed of laminated silt with shells _in situ_.” The shell-fragments are\r\nscratched and ice-worn, the same as the stones found in the clay. Not\r\nonly are the shells glaciated, but even the foraminifera, when seen\r\nthrough the microscope, have a rubbed and worn appearance. The shells\r\nhave evidently been broken, striated, and pushed along by the ice at\r\nthe time the boulder clay was being formed.\r\n\r\n_Theories regarding the Origin of the Caithness Clay._—Mr. Jamieson, as\r\nwe have seen, freely admits that the boulder clay of Caithness has the\r\nappearance of true land-ice till, but from the N.W. and S.E. direction\r\nof the striæ on the rocks, and the presence of sea-shells in the clay,\r\nhe has come to the conclusion that the glaciation of Caithness has been\r\neffected by floating ice at a time when the district was submerged. I\r\nhave always felt convinced that Mr. Jamieson had not hit upon the true\r\nexplanation of the phenomena.\r\n\r\n(1) It is physically impossible that any deposit formed by icebergs\r\ncould be wholly unstratified. Suppose a mass of the materials which\r\nwould form boulder clay is dropped into the sea from, say an iceberg,\r\nthe heavier parts, such as stones, will reach the bottom first. Then\r\nwill follow lighter materials, such as sand, then clay, and last of all\r\nthe mud will settle down over the whole in fine layers. The different\r\nmasses dropped from the various icebergs, will, no doubt, lie in\r\nconfusion one over the other, but each separate mass will show signs of\r\nstratification. A good deal of boulder clay evidently has been formed\r\nin the sea, but if the clay be unstratified, it must have been formed\r\nunder glaciers moving along the sea-bottom as on dry ground. Whether\r\n_unstratified_ boulder clay may happen to be formed under water or on\r\ndry land, it must in either case be the product of land-ice.[251] Those\r\nwho imagine that materials, differing in specific gravity like those\r\nwhich compose boulder clay, dropped into water, can settle down without\r\nassuming the stratified form, should make the experiment, and they\r\nwould soon satisfy themselves that the thing is physically impossible.\r\nThe notion that unstratified boulder clay could be formed by deposits\r\nfrom floating ice, is not only erroneous, but positively pernicious,\r\nfor it tends to lead those who entertain it astray in regard to the\r\nwhole question of the origin of drift.\r\n\r\n(2) It is also physically impossible that ice-markings, such as those\r\neverywhere found on the rocky face of the district, and on the pebbles\r\nand shells imbedded in the clay, could have been effected by any other\r\nagency than that of land-ice. I need not here enter into any discussion\r\non this point, as this has been done at considerable length in another\r\nplace.[252] In the present case, however, it is unnecessary, because\r\nif it can be shown that all the facts are accounted for in the most\r\nnatural manner by the theory of land-ice, no one will contend for the\r\nfloating-ice theory; for it is admitted that, with the exception of the\r\ndirection of the striæ and the presence of the shells, all the facts\r\nagree better with the land-ice than with the floating-ice theory.\r\n\r\nMy first impression on the subject was that the glaciation of Caithness\r\nhad been effected by the polar ice-cap, which, during the severer part\r\nof the glacial epoch, must have extended down to at least the latitude\r\nof the north of Scotland.\r\n\r\nOn a former occasion (see the _Reader_ for 14th October, 1865) it was\r\nshown that all the northern seas, owing to their shallowness, must,\r\nat that period, have been blocked up with solid ice, which displaced\r\nthe water and moved along the sea-bottoms the same as on dry land. In\r\nfact, the northern seas, including the German Ocean, being filled at\r\nthe time with glacier-ice, might be regarded as dry land. Ice of this\r\nsort, moving along the bed of the German Ocean or North Sea, and over\r\nCaithness, could not fail to push before it the shells and other animal\r\nremains lying on the sea-bottom, and to mix them up with the clay\r\nwhich now remains upon the land as evidence of its progress.\r\n\r\nAbout two years ago I had a conversation with Mr. C. W. Peach on the\r\nsubject. This gentleman, as is well known, has long been familiar with\r\nthe boulder clay of Caithness. He felt convinced that the clay of that\r\ncountry is the true Lower Till, and not a more recent deposit, as Mr.\r\nJamieson supposes. He expressed to me his opinion that the glaciation\r\nof Caithness had been effected by masses of land-ice crossing the\r\nMoray Firth from the mountain ranges to the south-east, and passing\r\nover Caithness in its course. The difficulty which seems to beset\r\nthis theory is, that a glacier entering the Firth would not leave it\r\nand ascend over the Caithness coast. It would take the path of least\r\nresistance and move into the North Sea, where it would find a free\r\npassage into deeper water. Mr. Peach’s theory is, however, an important\r\nstep in the right direction. It is a part of the truth, but I believe\r\nnot the whole truth. The following is submitted as a solution of the\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n_The Proposed Theory._—It may now be regarded as an established fact\r\nthat, during the severer part of the glacial period, Scotland was\r\ncovered with one continuous mantle of ice, so thick as to bury under\r\nit the Ochil, Sidlaw, Pentland, Campsie, and other moderately high\r\nmountain ranges. For example, Mr. J. Geikie and Mr. B. N. Peach found\r\nthat the great masses of the ice from the North-west Highlands, came\r\nstraight over the Ochils of Perthshire and the Lomonds of Fife. In\r\nfact, these mountain ridges were not sufficiently high to deflect the\r\nicy stream either to the right hand or to the left; and the flattened\r\nand rounded tops of the Campsie, Pentland, and Lammermoor ranges bear\r\nample testimony to the denuding power of ice.\r\n\r\nFurther, to quote from Mr. Jamieson, “the detached mountain of\r\nSchehallion in Perthshire, 3,500 feet high, is marked near the top as\r\nwell as on its flanks, and this not by ice flowing down the sides of\r\nthe hill itself, but by ice pressing over it from the north. On the top\r\nof another isolated hill, called Morven, about 3,000 feet high, and\r\nsituated a few miles to the north of the village of Ballater, in the\r\ncounty of Aberdeen, I found granite boulders unlike the rock of the\r\nhill, and apparently derived from the mountains to the west. Again,\r\non the highest watersheds of the Ochils, at altitudes of about 2,000\r\nfeet, I found this summer (1864) pieces of mica schist full of garnets,\r\nwhich seem to have come from the Grampian Hills to the north-west,\r\nshowing that the transporting agent had overflowed even the highest\r\nparts of the Ochil ridge. And on the West Lomonds, in Fifeshire, at\r\nClattering-well Quarry, 1,450 feet high, I found ice-worn pebbles of\r\nRed Sandstone and porphyry in the _débris_ covering the Carboniferous\r\nLimestone of the top of the Bishop Hill. Facts like these meet us\r\neverywhere. Thus on the Perthshire Hills, between Blair Athol and\r\nDunkeld, I found ice-worn surfaces of rocks on the tops of hills, at\r\nelevations of 2,200 feet, as if caused by ice pressing over them from\r\nthe north-west, and transporting boulders at even greater heights.”[253]\r\n\r\nFacts still more important, however, in their bearing on the question\r\nbefore us were observed on the Pentland range by Mr. Bennie and myself\r\nduring the summer of 1870. On ascending Allermuir, one of the hills\r\nforming the northern termination of the Pentland range, we were not a\r\nlittle surprised to find its summit ice-worn and striated. The top of\r\nthe hill is composed of a compact porphyritic felstone, which is very\r\nmuch broken up; but wherever any remains of the original surface could\r\nbe seen, it was found to be polished and striated in a most decided\r\nmanner. These striæ are all in one uniform direction, nearly east and\r\nwest; and on minutely examining them with a lens we had no difficulty\r\nwhatever in determining that the ice which effected them came from the\r\nwest and not from the east, a fact which clearly shows that they must\r\nhave been made at the time when, as is well known, the entire Midland\r\nvalley was filled with ice, coming from the North-west Highlands. On\r\nthe summit of the hill we also found patches of boulder clay in hollow\r\nbasins of the rock. At one spot it was upwards of a foot in depth, and\r\nrested on the ice-polished surface. The clay was somewhat loose and\r\nsandy, as might be expected of a layer so thin, exposed to rain, frost,\r\nand snow, during the long course of ages which must have elapsed since\r\nit was deposited there. Of 100 pebbles collected from the clay, just as\r\nthey turned up, every one, with the exception of three or four composed\r\nof hard quartz, presented a flattened and ice-worn surface; and\r\nforty-four were distinctly striated: in short, every stone which was\r\ncapable of receiving and retaining scratches was striated. A number of\r\nthese stones must have come from the Highlands to the north-west.[254]\r\n\r\nThe height of Allermuir is 1,617 feet, and, from its position, it is\r\nimpossible that the ice could have gone over its summit, unless the\r\nentire Midland valley, at this place, had been filled with ice to the\r\ndepth of more than 1,600 feet. The hill is situated about four or\r\nfive miles to the south of Edinburgh, and forms, as has already been\r\nstated, the northern termination of the Pentland range. Immediately\r\nto the north lies the broad valley of the Firth of Forth, more than\r\ntwelve miles across, offering a most free and unobstructed outlet for\r\nthe great mass of ice coming along the Midland valley from the west.\r\nNow, when we reflect how easily ice can accommodate itself to the\r\ninequalities of the channel along which it moves, how it can turn to\r\nthe right hand or to the left, so as to find for itself the path of\r\nleast resistance, it becomes obvious that the ice never would have gone\r\nover Allermuir, unless not only the Midland valley at this point, but\r\nalso the whole surrounding country had been covered with one continuous\r\nmass of ice to a depth of more than 1,600 feet. But it must not be\r\nsupposed that the height of Allermuir represents the thickness of the\r\nice; for on ascending Scald Law, a hill four miles to the south-west\r\nof Allermuir, and the highest of the Pentland range, we found, in\r\nthe _débris_ covering its summit, hundreds of transported stones of\r\nall sizes, from one to eighteen inches in diameter. We also dug up a\r\nGreenstone boulder about eighteen inches in diameter, which was finely\r\npolished and striated. As the height of this hill is 1,898 feet, the\r\nmass of ice covering the surrounding country must have been at least\r\n1,900 feet deep. But this is not all. Directly to the north of the\r\nPentlands, in a line nearly parallel with the east coast, and at right\r\nangles to the path of ice from the interior, there is not, with the\r\nexception of the solitary peak of East Lomond, and a low hill or two of\r\nthe Sidlaw range, an eminence worthy of the name of a hill nearer than\r\nthe Grampians in the north of Forfarshire, distant upwards of sixty\r\nmiles. This broad plain, extending from almost the Southern to the\r\nNorthern Highlands, was the great channel through which the ice of the\r\ninterior of Scotland found an outlet into the North Sea. If the depth\r\nof the ice in the Firth of Forth, which forms the southern side of this\r\nbroad hollow, was at least 1,900 feet, it is not at all probable that\r\nits depth in the northern side, formed by the Valley of Strathmore\r\nand the Firth of Tay, which lay more directly in the path of the ice\r\nfrom the North Highlands, could have been less. Here we have one vast\r\nglacier, more than sixty miles broad and 1,900 feet thick, coming from\r\nthe interior of the country.\r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, evident that the great mass of ice entering the North\r\nSea to the east of Scotland, especially about the Firths of Forth\r\nand Tay, could not have been less, and was probably much more, than\r\nfrom 1,000 to 2,000 feet in thickness. The grand question now to be\r\nconsidered is, What became of the huge sheet of ice after it entered\r\nthe North Sea? Did it break up and float away as icebergs? This appears\r\nto have been hitherto taken for granted; but the shallowness of the\r\nNorth Sea shows such a process to have been utterly impossible. The\r\ndepth of the sea in the English Channel is only about twenty fathoms,\r\nand although it gradually increases to about forty fathoms at the\r\nMoray Firth, yet we must go to the north and west of the Orkney and\r\nShetland Islands ere we reach the 100 fathom line. Thus the average\r\ndepth of the entire North Sea is not over forty fathoms, which is even\r\ninsufficient to float an iceberg 300 feet thick.\r\n\r\nNo doubt the North Sea, for two reasons, is now much shallower than\r\nit was during the period in question. (1.) There would, at the time\r\nof the great extension of the ice on the northern hemisphere, be a\r\nconsiderable submergence, resulting from the displacement of the\r\nearth’s centre of gravity.[255] (2.) The sea-bed is now probably\r\nfilled up to a larger extent with drift deposits than it was at the\r\nice period. But, after making the most extravagant allowance for the\r\nadditional depth gained on this account, still there could not possibly\r\nhave been water sufficiently deep to float a glacier of 1,000 or 2,000\r\nfeet in thickness. Indeed, the North Sea would have required to be\r\nnearly ten times deeper than it is at present to have floated the\r\nice of the glacial period. We may, therefore, conclude with the most\r\nperfect certainty that the ice-sheet of Scotland could not possibly\r\nhave broken up into icebergs in such a channel, but must have moved\r\nalong on the bed of the sea in one unbroken mass, and must have found\r\nits way to the deep trough of the Atlantic, west of the Orkney and\r\nShetland Islands, ere it broke up and floated away in the iceberg form.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to remark that the waters of the North Sea would\r\nhave but little effect in melting the ice. A shallow sea like this,\r\ninto which large masses of ice were entering, would be kept constantly\r\nabout the freezing-point, and water of this temperature has but little\r\nmelting power, for it takes 142 lbs. of water, at 33°, to melt one\r\npound of ice. In fact, an icy sea tends rather to protect the ice\r\nentering it from being melted than otherwise. And besides, owing to\r\nfresh acquisitions of snow, the ice-sheet would be accumulating more\r\nrapidly upon its upper surface than it would be melting at its lower\r\nsurface, supposing there were sea-water under that surface. The ice of\r\nScotland during the glacial period must, of necessity, have found its\r\nway into warmer water than that of the North Sea before it could have\r\nbeen melted. But this it could not do without reaching the Atlantic,\r\nand in getting there it would have to pass round by the Orkney Islands,\r\nalong the bed of the North Sea, as land-ice.\r\n\r\nThis will explain how the Orkney Islands may have been glaciated by\r\nland-ice; but it does not, however, explain how Caithness should have\r\nbeen glaciated by that means. These islands lay in the very track of\r\nthe ice on its way to the Atlantic, and could hardly escape being\r\noverridden; but Caithness lay considerably to the left of the path\r\nwhich we should expect the ice to have taken. The ice would not leave\r\nits channel, turn to the left, and ascend upon Caithness, unless it\r\nwere forced to do so. What, then, compelled the ice to pass over\r\nCaithness?\r\n\r\n_Path of the Scandinavian Ice._—We must consider that the ice from\r\nScotland and England was but a fraction of that which entered the\r\nNorth Sea. The greater part of the ice of Scandinavia must have gone\r\ninto this sea, and if the ice of our island could not find water\r\nsufficiently deep in which to float, far less would the much thicker\r\nice of Scandinavia do so. The Scandinavian ice, before it could break\r\nup, would thus, like the Scottish ice, have to cross the bed of the\r\nNorth Sea and pass into the Atlantic. It could not pass to the north,\r\nor to the north-west, for the ocean in these directions would be\r\nblocked up by the polar ice. It is true that along the southern shore\r\nof Norway there extends a comparatively deep trough of from one to two\r\nhundred fathoms. But this is evidently not deep enough to have floated\r\nthe Scandinavian ice-sheet; and even supposing it had been sufficiently\r\ndeep, the floating ice must have found its way to the Atlantic, and\r\nthis it could not have done without passing along the coast. Now, its\r\npassage would not only be obstructed by the mass of ice continually\r\nprotruding into the sea directly at right angles to its course, but it\r\nwould be met by the still more enormous masses of ice coming off the\r\nentire Norwegian coast-line. And, besides this, the ice entering the\r\nArctic Ocean from Lapland and the northern parts of Siberia, except\r\nthe very small portion which might find an outlet into the Pacific\r\nthrough Behring’s Straits, would have to pass along the Scandinavian\r\ncoast in its way to the Atlantic. No matter, then, what the depth of\r\nthis trough may have been, if the ice from the land, after entering\r\nit, could not make its escape, it would continue to accumulate till\r\nthe trough became blocked up; and after this, the great mass from the\r\nland would move forward as though the trough had no existence. Thus,\r\nthe only path for the ice would be by the Orkney and Shetland Islands.\r\nIts more direct and natural path would, no doubt, be to the south-west,\r\nin the direction of our shores; and in all probability, had Scotland\r\nbeen a low flat island, instead of being a high and mountainous one,\r\nthe ice would have passed completely over it. But its mountainous\r\ncharacter, and the enormous masses of ice at the time proceeding from\r\nits interior, would effectually prevent this, so that the ice of\r\nScandinavia would be compelled to move round by the Orkney Islands.\r\nConsequently, these two huge masses of moving ice—the one from Scotland\r\nand the much greater one from Scandinavia—would meet in the North Sea,\r\nprobably not far from our shores, and would move, as represented in\r\nthe diagram, side by side northwards into the Atlantic as one gigantic\r\nglacier.\r\n\r\nNor can this be regarded as an anomalous state of things; for in\r\nGreenland and the antarctic continent the ice does not break up into\r\nicebergs on reaching the sea, but moves along the sea-bottom in a\r\ncontinuous mass until it reaches water sufficiently deep to float\r\nit. It is quite possible that the ice at the present day may nowhere\r\ntraverse a distance of three or four hundred miles of sea-bottom, but\r\nthis is wholly owing to the fact that it finds water sufficiently deep\r\nto float it before having travelled so far. Were Baffin’s Bay and\r\nDavis’s Straits, for example, as shallow as the North Sea, the ice of\r\nGreenland would not break up into icebergs in these seas, but cross in\r\none continuous mass to and over the American continent.\r\n\r\nThe median line of the Scandinavian and Scottish ice-sheets would be\r\nsituated not far from the east coast of Scotland. The Scandinavian ice\r\nwould press up as near to our coast as the resistance of the ice from\r\nthis side permitted. The enormous mass of ice from Scotland, pressing\r\nout into the North Sea, would compel the Scandinavian ice to move round\r\nby the Orkneys, and would also keep it at some little distance from\r\nScotland. Where, on the other hand, there was but little resistance\r\noffered by ice from the interior of this country (and this might be the\r\ncase along many parts of the English coast), the Scandinavian ice might\r\nreach the shores, and even overrun the country for some distance inland.\r\n\r\nWe have hitherto confined our attention to the action of ice proceeding\r\nfrom Norway; but if we now consider what took place in Sweden and the\r\nBaltic, we shall find more conclusive proof of the downward pressure\r\nof Scandinavian ice on our own shores. The western half of Gothland\r\nis striated in the direction of N.E. and S.W., and that this has been\r\neffected by a huge mass of ice covering the country, and not by local\r\nglaciers, is apparent from the fact observed by Robert Chambers,[256]\r\nand officers of the Swedish Geological Survey, that the general\r\ndirection of the groovings and striæ on the rocks bears little or no\r\nrelation to the conformation of the surface, showing that the ice was\r\nof sufficient thickness to move straight forward, regardless of the\r\ninequalities of the ground.\r\n\r\nAt Gottenburg, on the shores of the Cattegat, and all around Lake\r\nWener and Lake Wetter, the ice-markings are of the most remarkable\r\ncharacter, indicating, in the most decided manner, that the ice came\r\nfrom the interior of the country to the north-east in one vast mass.\r\nAll this mass of ice must have gone into the shallow Cattegat, a sea\r\nnot sufficiently deep to float even an ordinary glacier. The ice coming\r\noff Gothland would therefore cross the Cattegat, and thence pass over\r\nJutland into the North Sea. After entering the North Sea, it would be\r\nobliged to keep between our shores and the ice coming direct from the\r\nwestern side of Scandinavia.\r\n\r\nBut this is not all. A very large proportion of the Scandinavian ice\r\nwould pass into the Gulf of Bothnia, where it could not possibly float.\r\nIt would then move south into the Baltic as land-ice. After passing\r\ndown the Baltic, a portion of the ice would probably move south into\r\nthe flat plains in the north of Germany, but the greater portion\r\nwould keep in the bed of the Baltic, and of course turn to the right\r\nround the south end of Gothland, and thence cross over Denmark into\r\nthe North Sea. That this must have been the path of the ice is, I\r\nthink, obvious from the observations of Murchison, Chambers, Hörbye,\r\nand other geologists. Sir Roderick Murchison found—though he does not\r\nattribute it to land-ice—that the Aland Islands, which lie between the\r\nGulf of Bothnia and the Baltic, are all striated in a north and south\r\ndirection.[257]\r\n\r\nUpsala and Stockholm, a tract of flat country projecting for some\r\ndistance into the Baltic, is also grooved and striated, not in the\r\ndirection that would be effected by ice coming from the interior of\r\nScandinavia, but north and south, in a direction parallel to what must\r\nhave been the course of the ice moving down the Baltic.[258] This part\r\nof the country must have been striated by a mass of ice coming from\r\nthe direction of the Gulf of Bothnia. And that this mass must have\r\nbeen great is apparent from the fact that Lake Malar, which crosses\r\nthe country from east to west, at right angles to the path of the ice,\r\ndoes not seem to have had any influence in deflecting the icy stream.\r\nThat the ice came from the north and not from the south is also evident\r\nfrom the fact that the northern sides of rocky eminences are polished,\r\nrounded, and ice-worn, while the southern sides are comparatively\r\nrough. The northern banks of Lake Malar, for example, which, of course,\r\nface the south, are rough, while the southern banks, which must have\r\noffered opposition to the advance of the ice, are smoothed and rounded\r\nin a most singular manner.\r\n\r\nAgain, that the ice, after passing down the Baltic, turned to the\r\nright along the southern end of Gothland, is shown by the direction\r\nof the striæ and ice-groovings observed on such islands as Gothland,\r\nÖland, and Bornholm. Sir R. Murchison found that the island of\r\nGothland is grooved and striated in one uniform direction from N.E.\r\nto S.W. “These groovings,” says Sir Roderick, “so perfectly resemble\r\nthe flutings and striæ produced in the Alps by the actual movement\r\nof glaciers, that neither M. Agassiz nor any one of his supporters\r\ncould detect a difference.” He concludes, however, that the markings\r\ncould not have been made by land-ice, because Gothland is not only a\r\nlow, flat island in the middle of the Baltic, but is “at least 400\r\nmiles distant from any elevation to which the term of mountain can be\r\napplied.” This, of course, is conclusive against the hypothesis that\r\nGothland and the other islands of the Baltic could have been glaciated\r\nby ordinary glaciers; but it is quite in harmony with the theory\r\nthat the Gulf of Bothnia and the entire Baltic were filled with one\r\ncontinuous mass of land-ice, derived from the drainage of the greater\r\npart of Sweden, Lapland, and Finland. In fact, the whole glacial\r\nphenomena of Scandinavia are inexplicable on the hypothesis of local\r\nglaciers.\r\n\r\nThat the Baltic was completely filled by a mass of ice moving from the\r\nnorth is further evidenced by the fact that the mainland, not only at\r\nUpsala, but at several places along the coast of Gothland, is grooved\r\nand striated parallel to the shore, and often at right angles to the\r\nmarkings of the ice from the interior, showing that the present bed of\r\nthe Baltic was not large enough to contain the icy stream. For example,\r\nalong the shores between Kalmar and Karlskrona, as described by Sir\r\nRoderick Murchison and by M. Hörbye, the striations are parallel to the\r\nshore. Perhaps the slight obstruction offered by the island of Öland,\r\nsituated so close to the shore, would deflect the edge of the stream at\r\nthis point over on the land. The icy stream, after passing Karlskrona,\r\nbent round to the west along the present entrance to the Baltic, and\r\nagain invaded the mainland, and crossed over the low headland of\r\nChristianstadt, and thence passed westward in the direction of Zealand.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: PLATE V.\r\n\r\n  W. & A. K. Johnston, Edinb^r. and London.\r\n\r\n  CHART SHOWING THE PROBABLE PATH OF THE ICE IN NORTH-WESTERN EUROPE\r\n  DURING THE PERIOD OF MAXIMUM GLACIATION.\r\n\r\n  _The lines also represent the actual direction of the striae on the\r\n  rocks._]\r\n\r\nThis immense Baltic glacier would in all probability pass over Denmark,\r\nand enter the North Sea somewhere to the north of the River Elbe, and\r\nwould then have to find an outlet to the Atlantic through the English\r\nChannel, or pass in between our eastern shores and the mass from\r\nGothland and the north-western shores of Europe. The entire probable\r\npath of the ice may be seen by a reference to the accompanying chart\r\n(Plate V.) That the ice crossed over Denmark is evident from the fact\r\nthat the surface of that country is strewn with _débris_ derived from\r\nthe Scandinavian peninsula.\r\n\r\nTaking all these various considerations into account, the conclusion is\r\ninevitable that the great masses of ice from Scotland would be obliged\r\nto turn abruptly to the north, as represented in the diagram, and pass\r\nround into the Atlantic in the direction of Caithness and the Orkney\r\nIslands.\r\n\r\nIf the foregoing be a fair representation of the state of matters,\r\nit is physically impossible that Caithness could have escaped being\r\noverridden by the land-ice of the North Sea. Caithness, as is well\r\nknown, is not only a low, flat tract of land, little elevated above the\r\nsea-level, and consequently incapable of supporting large glaciers;\r\nbut, in addition, it projects in the form of a headland across the\r\nvery path of the ice. Unless Caithness could have protected itself by\r\npushing into the sea glaciers of one or two thousand feet in thickness,\r\nit could not possibly have escaped the inroads of the ice of the\r\nNorth Sea. But Caithness itself could not have supported glaciers of\r\nthis magnitude, neither could it have derived them from the adjoining\r\nmountainous regions of Sutherland, for the ice of this county found a\r\nmore direct outlet than along the flat plains of Caithness.\r\n\r\nThe shells which the boulder clay of Caithness contains have thus\r\nevidently been pushed out of the bed of the North Sea by the land-ice,\r\nwhich formed the clay itself.\r\n\r\nThe fact that these shells are not so intensely arctic as those found\r\nin some other quarters of Scotland, is no evidence that the clay was\r\nnot formed during the most severe part of the glacial epoch, for the\r\nshells did not live in the North Sea at the time that it was filled\r\nwith land-ice. The shells must have belonged to a period prior to the\r\ninvasion of the ice, and consequently before the cold had reached its\r\ngreatest intensity. Neither is there any necessity for supposing the\r\nshells to be pre-glacial, for these shells may have belonged to an\r\ninter-glacial period. In so far as Scotland is concerned, it would be\r\nhazardous to conclude that a plant or an animal is either pre-glacial\r\nor post-glacial simply because it may happen not to be of an arctic or\r\nof a boreal type.\r\n\r\nThe same remarks which apply to Caithness apply to a certain extent\r\nto the headland at Fraserburgh. It, too, lay in the path of the ice,\r\nand from the direction of the striæ on the rocks, and the presence of\r\nshells in the clay, as described by Mr. Jamieson, it bears evidence\r\nalso of having been overridden by the land-ice of the North Sea.\r\nIn fact, we have, in the invasion of Caithness and the headland at\r\nFraserburgh by the land-ice of the North Sea, a repetition of what we\r\nhave seen took place at Upsala, Kalmar, Christianstadt, and other flat\r\ntracts along the sides of the Baltic.\r\n\r\nThe scarcity, or perhaps entire absence of Scandinavian boulders in\r\nthe Caithness clay is not in any way unfavourable to the theory, for\r\nit would only be the left edge of the North Sea glacier that could\r\npossibly pass over Caithness; and this edge, as we have seen, was\r\ncomposed of the land-ice from Scotland. We might expect, however, to\r\nfind Scandinavian blocks on the Shetland and Faroe Islands, for, as we\r\nshall presently see, there is pretty good evidence to prove that the\r\nScandinavian ice passed over these islands.\r\n\r\n_The Shetland and Faroe Islands glaciated by Land-ice._—It is also\r\nworthy of notice that the striæ on the rocks in the Orkney, Shetland,\r\nand Faroe Islands, all point in the direction of Scandinavia, and are\r\nwhat would be effected by land-ice moving in the paths indicated\r\nin the diagram. And it is a fact of some significance, that when we\r\nproceed north to Iceland, the striæ, according to the observations\r\nof Robert Chambers, seem to point towards North Greenland. Is it\r\npossible that the entire Atlantic, from Scandinavia to Greenland, was\r\nfilled with land-ice? Astounding as this may at first appear, there\r\nare several considerations which render such a conclusion probable.\r\nThe observations of Chambers, Peach, Hibbert, Allan, and others, show\r\nthat the rocky face of the Shetland and Faroe Islands has been ground,\r\npolished, and striated in a most remarkable manner. That this could not\r\nhave been done by ice belonging to the islands themselves is obvious,\r\nfor these islands are much too small to have supported glaciers of any\r\nsize, and the smallest of them is striated as well as the largest.\r\nBesides, the uniform direction of the striæ on the rocks shows that\r\nit must have been effected by ice passing over the islands. That the\r\nstriations could not have been effected by floating icebergs at a time\r\nwhen the islands were submerged is, I think, equally obvious, from the\r\nfact that not only are the tops of the highest eminences ice-worn,\r\nbut the entire surface down to the present sea-level is smoothed and\r\nstriated; and these striations conform to all the irregularities of the\r\nsurface. This last fact Professor Geikie has clearly shown is wholly\r\nirreconcilable with the floating-ice theory.[259] Mr. Peach[260] found\r\nvertical precipices in the Shetlands grooved and striated, and the\r\nsame thing was observed by Mr. Thomas Allan on the Faroe Islands.[261]\r\nThat the whole of these islands have been glaciated by a continuous\r\nsheet of ice passing over them was the impression left on the mind of\r\nRobert Chambers after visiting them.[262] This is the theory which\r\nalone explains all the facts. The only difficulty which besets it is\r\nthe enormous thickness of the ice demanded by the theory. But this\r\ndifficulty is very much diminished when we reflect that we have good\r\nevidence, from the thickness of icebergs which have been met with\r\nin the Southern Ocean,[263] that the ice moving off the antarctic\r\ncontinent must be in some places considerably over a mile in thickness.\r\nIt is then not so surprising that the ice of the glacial epoch, coming\r\noff Greenland and Northern Europe, should not have been able to float\r\nin the North Atlantic.\r\n\r\n_Why the Ice of Scotland was of such enormous Thickness._—The enormous\r\nthickness of the ice in Scotland, during the glacial epoch, has been\r\na matter of no little surprise. It is remarkable how an island, not\r\nmore than 100 miles across, should have been covered with a sheet\r\nof ice so thick as to bury mountain ranges more than 1,000 feet in\r\nheight, situated almost at the sea-shore. But all our difficulties\r\ndisappear when we reflect that the seas around Scotland, owing to their\r\nshallowness, were, during the glacial period, blocked up with solid\r\nice. Scotland, Scandinavia, and the North Sea, would form one immense\r\ntable-land of ice, from 1,000 to 2,000 feet above the sea-level. This\r\ntable-land would terminate in the deep waters of the Atlantic by a\r\nperpendicular wall of ice, extending probably from the west of Ireland\r\naway in the direction of Iceland. From this barrier icebergs would be\r\ncontinually breaking off, rivalling in magnitude those which are now to\r\nbe met with in the antarctic seas.\r\n\r\n_The great Extension of the Loess accounted for._—An effect which would\r\nresult from the blocking up of the North Sea with land-ice, would be\r\nthat the waters of the Rhine, Elbe, and Thames would have to find\r\nan outlet into the Atlantic through the English Channel. Professor\r\nGeikie has suggested to me that if the Straits of Dover were not then\r\nopen—quite a possible thing—or were they blocked up with land-ice, say\r\nby the great Baltic glacier crossing over from Denmark, the consequence\r\nwould be that the waters of the Rhine and Elbe would be dammed back,\r\nand would inundate all the low-lying tracts of country to the south;\r\nand this might account for the extraordinary extension of the Loess in\r\nthe basin of the Rhine, and in Belgium and the north of France.[264]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: PLATE VI.\r\n\r\n  CHART SHOWING PATH OF THE ICE\r\n\r\n  W. & A.

N. Peach. The latter geologist says, “Near the Ord\r\nof Caithness and on to Berriedale the striæ pass off the land and out\r\nto sea; but near Dunbeath, 6 miles north-east of Berriedale, they\r\nbegin to creep up out of the sea on to the land and range from about\r\n15° to 10° east of north. _Where the striæ pass out to the sea_ the\r\nboulder clay is made up of the materials from inland and contains no\r\nshells, but _immediately the striæ begin to creep up on to the land_\r\nthen shells begin to make their appearance; and there is a difference,\r\nmoreover, in the colour of the clay, for in the former case it is\r\nred and incoherent, and in the latter hard and dark-coloured.” The\r\naccompanying chart (Plate VI.) shows the outline of the Caithness coast\r\nand the direction of the striæ as observed by Professor Geikie and Mr.\r\nPeach, and no demonstration could be more conclusive as to the path of\r\nthe ice and the obstacles it met than these observations, supplemented\r\nand confirmed as they are by other recorded facts to which I shall\r\npresently allude. Had the ice-current as it entered the North Sea off\r\nthe Sutherland coast met with no obstacle it would have ploughed its\r\nway outwards till it broke off in glaciers and floated away. But it is\r\nclear that the great press of Scandinavian ice and the smaller mass of\r\nland-ice from the Morayshire coast converging in the North Sea filled\r\nup its entire bed, and these, meeting the opposing current from the\r\nSutherland coast, turned it back upon itself, and forced it over the\r\nnorth-east part of Caithness. The farther south on the Sutherland\r\ncoast that the ice entered the sea the deeper would it be able to\r\npenetrate into the ocean-bed before it met an opposition sufficiently\r\nstrong to turn its course, and the wider would be its sweep; but when\r\nwe come to the Sutherland coast we reach a point where the land-ice—as,\r\nfor example, near Dunbeath—is forced to bend round before it even\r\nreaches the sea-shore, as will be seen from the accompanying diagram.\r\n\r\nWe are led to the same conclusions regarding the path of the ice in the\r\nNorth Sea from the presence of oolitic fossils and chalk flints found\r\nlikewise in the boulder clay of Caithness, for these, as we shall see,\r\nevidently must have come from the sea. At the meeting of the British\r\nAssociation, Edinburgh, 1850, Hugh Miller exhibited a collection of\r\nboreal shells with fragments of oolitic fossils, chalk, and chalk\r\nflints from the boulder clay of Caithness collected by Mr. Dick, of\r\nThurso. My friend, Mr. C. W. Peach, found that the chalk flints in\r\nthe boulder clay of Caithness become more abundant as we proceed\r\nnorthward, while the island of Stroma in the Pentland Firth he found\r\nto be completely strewn with them. This same observer found, also, in\r\nthe Caithness clay stones belonging to the Oolitic and Lias formations,\r\nwith their characteristic fossils, while ammonites, belemnites, fossil\r\nwood, &c., &c., were also found loose in the clay.[265] The explanation\r\nevidently is, that these remains were derived from an outcrop of\r\noolitic and cretaceous beds in the North Sea. It is well known that\r\nthe eastern coast of Sutherlandshire is fringed with a narrow strip\r\nof oolite, which passes under the sea, but to what distance is not\r\nyet ascertained. Outside the Oolitic formation the chalk beds in all\r\nprobability crop out. It will be seen from a glance at the accompanying\r\nchart (Plate VI.) that the ice which passed over the north-eastern part\r\nof Caithness must have crossed the out-cropping chalk beds.\r\n\r\nAs has already been stated in the foregoing chapter, the headland of\r\nFraserburgh, north-eastern corner of Aberdeenshire, bears evidence,\r\nboth from the direction of the striæ and broken shells in the boulder\r\nclay, of having been overridden also by land-ice from the North Sea.\r\nThis conclusion is strengthened by the fact that chalk flints and\r\noolitic fossils have also been abundantly met with in the clay by Dr.\r\nKnight, Mr. James Christie, Mr. W. Ferguson, Mr. T. F. Jamieson, and\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\n      NORTH OF ENGLAND ICE-SHEET, AND TRANSPORT OF WASTDALE CRAG\r\n                             BLOCKS.[266]\r\n\r\n  Transport of Blocks; Theories of.—Evidence of Continental\r\n      Ice.—Pennine Range probably striated on Summit.—Glacial\r\n      Drift in Centre of England.—Mr. Lacy on Drift of Cotteswold\r\n      Hills.—England probably crossed by Land-ice.—Mr. Jack’s\r\n      Suggestion.—Shedding of Ice North and South.—South of England\r\n      Ice-sheet.—Glaciation of West Somerset.—Why Ice-markings are\r\n      so rare in South of England.—Form of Contortion produced by\r\n      Land-ice.\r\n\r\n\r\nConsiderable difficulty has been felt in accounting for the transport\r\nof the Wastdale granite boulders across the Pennine chain to the east.\r\nProfessors Harkness,[267] and Phillips,[268] Messrs. Searles Wood,\r\njun.,[269] Mackintosh,[270] and I presume all who have written on\r\nthe subject, agree that these blocks could not have been transported\r\nby land-ice. The agency of floating ice under some form or other is\r\nassumed by all.\r\n\r\nWe have in Scotland phenomena of an exactly similar nature. The summits\r\nof the Ochils, the Pentlands, and other mountain ranges in the east\r\nof Scotland, at elevations of from 1,500 to 2,000 feet, are not only\r\nice-marked, but strewn over with boulders derived from rocks to the\r\nwest and north-west. Many of them must have come from the Highlands\r\ndistant some 50 or 60 miles. It is impossible that these stones could\r\nhave been transported, or the summits of the hills striated, by means\r\nof ordinary glaciers. Neither can the phenomena be attributed to the\r\nagency of icebergs carried along by currents. For we should require to\r\nassume not merely a submergence of the land to the extent of 2,000\r\nfeet or so,—an assumption which might be permitted,—but also that the\r\ncurrents bearing the icebergs took their rise in the elevated mountains\r\nof the Highlands (a most unlikely place), and that these currents\r\nradiated in all directions from that place as a centre.\r\n\r\nIn short, the glacial phenomena of Scotland are wholly inexplicable\r\nupon any other theory than that, during at least a part of the\r\nglacial epoch, the entire island from sea to sea was covered with one\r\ncontinuous mass of ice of not less than 2,000 feet in thickness.\r\n\r\nIn my paper on the Boulder Clay of Caithness (see preceding chapter),\r\nI have shown that if the ice was 2,000 feet or so in thickness, it\r\nmust, in its motion seawards, have followed the paths indicated by the\r\ncurved lines in the chart accompanying that paper (See Plate V.). In\r\nso far as Scotland is concerned [and Scandinavia also], these lines\r\nrepresent pretty accurately not only the paths actually taken by the\r\nboulders, but also the general direction of the ice-markings on all the\r\nelevated mountain ridges. But if Scotland was covered to such an extent\r\nwith ice, it is not at all probable that Westmoreland and the other\r\nmountainous districts of the North of England could have escaped being\r\nenveloped in a somewhat similar manner. Now if we admit the supposition\r\nof a continuous mass of ice covering the North of England, all our\r\ndifficulties regarding the transport of the Wastdale blocks across the\r\nPennine chain disappear. An inspection of the chart above referred to\r\nwill show that these blocks followed the paths which they ought to have\r\ndone upon the supposition that they were conveyed by continental ice.\r\n\r\nThat Wastdale Crag itself suffered abrasion by ice moving over it, in\r\nthe direction indicated by the lines in the diagram, is obvious from\r\nwhat has been recorded by Dr. Nicholson and Mr. Mackintosh. They both\r\nfound the Crag itself beautifully _moutonnée_ up to its summit, and\r\nstriated in a W.S.W. and E.N.E. direction. Mr. Mackintosh states that\r\nthese scorings run obliquely up the sloping face of the crag. Ice\r\nscratches crossing valleys and running up the sloping faces of hills\r\nand over their summits are the sure marks of continental ice, which\r\nmeet the eye everywhere in Scotland. Dr. Nicholson found in the drift\r\ncovering the lower part of the crag, pebbles of the Coniston flags and\r\ngrits from the west.[271]\r\n\r\nThe fact that in Westmoreland the direction of the ice-markings, as a\r\ngeneral rule, corresponds with the direction of the main valleys, is\r\nno evidence whatever that the country was not at one period covered\r\nwith a continuous sheet of ice; because, for long ages after the period\r\nof continental ice, the valleys would be occupied by glaciers, and\r\nthese, of course, would necessarily leave the marks of their presence\r\nbehind. This is just what we have everywhere in Scotland. It is on\r\nthe summits of the hills and elevated ridges, where no glacier could\r\npossibly reach, that we find the sure evidence of continental ice.\r\nBut that land-ice should have passed over the tops of hills 1,000 or\r\n2,000 feet in height is a thing hitherto regarded by geologists as\r\nso unlikely that few of them ever think of searching in such places\r\nfor ice-markings, or for transported stones. Although little has been\r\nrecorded on this point, I hardly think it likely that there is in\r\nScotland a hill under 2,000 feet wholly destitute of evidence that ice\r\nhas gone over it. If there were hills in Scotland that should have\r\nescaped being overridden by ice, they were surely the Pentland Hills;\r\nbut these, as was shown on a former occasion,[272] were completely\r\nburied under the mass of ice covering the flat surrounding country.\r\nI have no doubt whatever that if the summits of the Pennine range\r\nwere carefully examined, say under the turf, evidence of ice-action,\r\nin the form of transported stones or scratches on the rock, would be\r\nfound.[273]\r\n\r\nNor is the fact that the Wastdale boulders are not rounded and\r\nice-marked, or found in the boulder clay, but lie on the surface, any\r\nevidence that they were not transported by land-ice. For it would not\r\nbe the stones _under_ the ice, but those falling on the upper surface\r\nof the sheet, that would stand the best chance of being carried over\r\nmountain ridges. But such blocks would not be crushed and ice-worn;\r\nand it is on the surface of the clay, and not imbedded in it, that we\r\nshould expect to find them.\r\n\r\nIt is quite possible that the dispersion of the Wastdale boulders took\r\nplace at various periods. During the period of local glaciers the\r\nblocks would be carried along the line of the valleys.\r\n\r\nAll I wish to maintain is that the transport of the blocks across\r\nthe Pennine chain is easily accounted for if we admit, what is very\r\nprobable, that the great ice-covering of Scotland overlapped the high\r\ngrounds of the North of England. The phenomenon is the same in both\r\nplaces, and why not attribute it to the same cause?\r\n\r\nThere is another curious circumstance connected with the drift of\r\nEngland which seems to indicate the agency of an ice-covering.\r\n\r\nAs far back as 1819, Dr. Buckland, in his Memoir on the Quartz Rock\r\nof Lickey Hill,[274] directed attention to the fact, that on the\r\nCotteswold Hills there are found pebbles of hard red chalk which must\r\nhave come from the Wolds of Yorkshire and Lincolnshire. He pointed\r\nout also that the slaty and porphyritic pebbles probably came from\r\nCharnwood Forest, near Leicester. Professor Hull, of the Geological\r\nSurvey, considers that “almost all the Northern Drift of this part\r\nof the country had been derived from the _débris_ of the rocks of\r\nthe Midland Counties.”[275] He came also to the conclusion that the\r\nslate fragments may have been derived from Charnwood Forest. In the\r\nVale of Moreton he found erratic boulders from two feet to three\r\nfeet in diameter. The same northern character of the drift of this\r\ndistrict is remarked by Professor Ramsay and Mr. Aveline, in their\r\nMemoir of the Geology of parts of Gloucestershire. In Leicestershire\r\nand Northamptonshire the officers of the Geological Survey found in\r\nabundance drift which must have come from Lincolnshire and Yorkshire to\r\nthe north-east.\r\n\r\nMr. Lucy, who has also lately directed attention to the fact that\r\nthe Cotteswold Hills are sprinkled over with boulders from Charnwood\r\nForest, states also that, on visiting the latter place, he found that\r\nmany of the stones contained in it had come from Yorkshire, still\r\nfurther to the north-east.[276]\r\n\r\nMr. Searles Wood, jun., in his interesting paper on the Boulder Clay\r\nof the North of England,[277] states that enormous quantities of the\r\nchalk _débris_ from the Yorkshire Wold are found in Leicester, Rutland,\r\nWarwick, Northampton, and other places to the south and south-west.\r\nMr. Wood justly concludes that this chalk _débris_ could not have been\r\ntransported by water. “If we consider,” he says, “the soluble nature\r\nof chalk, it must be evident that none of this débris can have been\r\ndetached from the parent mass, either by water-action, or by any other\r\natmospheric agency than moving ice. The action of the sea, of rivers,\r\nor of the atmosphere, upon chalk, would take the form of dissolution,\r\nthe degraded chalk being taken up in minute quantities by the water,\r\nand held in suspension by it, and in that form carried away; so that\r\nit seems obvious that this great volume of rolled chalk can have been\r\nproduced in no other way than by the agency of moving ice; and for that\r\nagency to have operated to an extent adequate to produce a quantity\r\nthat I estimate as exceeding a layer 200 feet thick over the entire\r\nWold, nothing less than the complete envelopment of a large part of the\r\nWold by ice for a long period would suffice.”\r\n\r\nI have already assigned my reasons for disbelieving the opinion that\r\nsuch masses of drift could have been transported by floating ice; but\r\nif we refer it to land-ice, it is obvious that the ice could not have\r\nbeen in the form of local glaciers, but must have existed as a sheet\r\nmoving in a south and south-west direction, from Yorkshire, across the\r\ncentral part of England. But how is this to harmonize with the theory\r\nof glaciation, which is advanced to explain the transport of the Shap\r\nboulders?\r\n\r\nThe explanation has, I think, been pointed out by a writer in the\r\n_Glasgow Herald_,[278] of the 26th November, 1870, in a review of Mr.\r\nLucy’s paper.\r\n\r\nIn my paper on the Boulder Clay of Caithness, I had represented the ice\r\nentering the North Sea from the east coast of Scotland and England,\r\nas all passing round the north of Scotland. But the reviewer suggests\r\nthat the ice entering at places to the south of, say, Flamborough Head,\r\nwould be deflected southwards instead of northwards, and thus pass over\r\nEngland. “It is improbable, however,” says the writer, “that this joint\r\nice-sheet would, as Mr. Croll supposes, all find its way round the\r\nnorth of Scotland into the deep sea. The southern uplands of Scotland,\r\nand probably also the mountains of Northumberland, propelled, during\r\nthe coldest part of the glacial period, a land ice-sheet in an eastward\r\ndirection. This sheet would be met by another streaming outward from\r\nthe south-western part of Norway—in a diametrically opposite direction.\r\nIn other words, an imaginary line might be drawn representing the\r\ncourse of some particular boulder in the _moraine profonde_ from\r\nEngland met by a boulder from Norway, in the same straight line. With\r\na dense ice-sheet to the north of this line, and an open plain to the\r\nsouth, it is clear that all the ice travelling east or west from points\r\nto the south of the starting-points of our two boulders would be ‘shed’\r\noff to the south. There would be a point somewhere along the line, at\r\nwhich the ice would turn as on a pivot—this point being nearer England\r\nor Scandinavia, as the degree of pressure exercised by the respective\r\nice-sheets should determine. There is very little doubt that the point\r\nin question would be nearer England. Further, the direction of the\r\njoint ice-sheet could not be _due_ south unless the pressure of the\r\ncomponent ice-sheets should be exactly equal. In the event of that from\r\nScandinavia pressing with greater force, the direction would be to the\r\nsouth-west. This is the direction in which the drifts described by Mr.\r\nLucy have travelled.”\r\n\r\nI can perceive no physical objection to this modification of the\r\ntheory. What the ice seeks is the path of least resistance, and along\r\nthis path it will move, whether it may lie to the south or to the\r\nnorth. And it is not at all improbable that an outlet to the ice would\r\nbe found along the natural hollow formed by the valleys of the Trent,\r\nAvon, and Severn. Ice moving in this direction would no doubt pass down\r\nthe Bristol Channel and thence into the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nMight not the shedding of the north of England ice-sheet to the north\r\nand south, somewhere not far from Stainmoor, account for the remarkable\r\nfact pointed out by Mr. Searles Wood, that the boulder clay, with\r\nShap boulders, to the north of the Wold is destitute of chalk; while,\r\non the other hand, the chalky boulder clay to the south of the Wold\r\nis destitute of Shap boulders? The ice which passed over Wastdale\r\nCrag moved to the E.N.E., and did not cross the chalk of the Wold;\r\nwhile the ice which bent round to the south by the Wold came from the\r\ndistrict lying to the south of Wastdale Crag, and consequently did not\r\ncarry with it any of the granite from that Crag. In fact, Mr. Searles\r\nWood has himself represented on the map accompanying his Memoir this\r\nshedding of the ice north and south.\r\n\r\nThese theoretical considerations are, of course, advanced for what\r\nthey are worth. Hitherto geologists have been proceeding upon the\r\nsupposition of an ice-sheet and an open North Sea; but the latter is\r\nan impossibility. But if we suppose the seas around our island to have\r\nbeen filled with land-ice during the glacial epoch, the entire glacial\r\nproblem is changed, and it does not then appear so surprising that ice\r\nshould have passed over England.\r\n\r\n\r\n               _Note on the South of England Ice-sheet._\r\n\r\nIf what has already been stated regarding the north of England be\r\nanything like correct, it is evident that the south of England\r\ncould not possibly have escaped glaciation. If the North Sea was so\r\ncompletely blocked up by Scandinavian ice, that the great mass of ice\r\nfrom the Cumberland mountains entering the sea on the east coast was\r\ncompelled to bend round and find a way of escape across the centre\r\nof England in the direction of the Bristol Channel, it is scarcely\r\npossible that the immense mass of ice filling the Baltic Sea and\r\ncrossing over Denmark could help passing across at least a portion\r\nof the south of England. The North Sea being blocked up, its natural\r\noutlet into the Atlantic would be through the English Channel; and it\r\nis not likely that it could pass through without impinging to some\r\nextent upon the land. Already geologists are beginning to recognise the\r\nevidence of ice in this region.\r\n\r\nMr. W. C. Lucy, in the _Geological Magazine_ for June, 1874, records\r\nthe finding by himself of evidences of glaciation in West Somerset,\r\nin the form of “rounded rocky knolls,” near Minehead, like those of\r\nglaciated districts; of a bed of gravel and clay 70 feet deep, which\r\nhe considered to be boulder clay. He also mentions the occurrence near\r\nPortlock of a large mass of sandstone well striated, only partially\r\ndetached from the parent rock. In the same magazine for the following\r\nmonth Mr. H. B. Woodward records the discovery by Mr. Usher of some\r\n“rum stuff” near Yarcombe, in the Black Down Hills of Devonshire,\r\nwhich, on investigation, proved to be boulder clay; and further, that\r\nit was not a mere isolated patch, but occurred in several other places\r\nin the same district. Mr. C. W. Peach informs me that on the Cornwall\r\ncoast, near Dodman Point, at an elevation of about 60 feet above\r\nsea-level, he found the rock surface well striated and ice-polished.\r\nIn a paper on the Drift Deposits of the Bath district, read before the\r\nBath Natural History and Antiquarian Field Club, March 10th, 1874,\r\nMr. C. Moore describes the rock surfaces as grooved, with deep and\r\nlong-continued furrows similar to those usually found on glaciated\r\nrocks, and concludes that during the glacial period they were subjected\r\nto ice-action. This conclusion is confirmed by the fact of there being\r\nfound, immediately overlying these glaciated rocks, beds of gravel\r\nwith intercalated clay-beds, having a thickness of 30 feet, in which\r\nmammalian remains of arctic types are abundant. The most characteristic\r\nof which are _Elephas primigenius_, _E. antiquus_, _Rhinoceros\r\ntichorhinus_, _Bubalus moschatus_, and _Cervus tarandus_.\r\n\r\nThere is little doubt that when the ground is better examined many\r\nother examples will be found. One reason, probably, why so little\r\nevidence of glaciation in the south of England has been recorded,\r\nis the comparative absence of rock surfaces suitable for retaining\r\nice-markings. There is, however, one class of evidence which might\r\ndetermine the question of the glaciation of the south of England as\r\nsatisfactorily as markings on the rock. The evidence to which I refer\r\nis that of contorted beds of sand or clay. In England contortions from\r\nthe sinking of the beds are, of course, quite common, but a thoughtful\r\nobserver, who has had a little experience of ice-formed contortions,\r\ncan easily, without much trouble, distinguish the latter from the\r\nformer. Contortions resulting from the lateral pressure of the ice\r\nassume a different form from those produced by the sinking of the beds.\r\nIn Scotland, for example, there is one well-marked form of contortion,\r\nwhich not only proves the existence of land-ice, but also the direction\r\nin which it moved. The form of contortion to which I refer is the\r\nbending back of the stratified beds upon themselves, somewhat in\r\nthe form of a fishing-hook. This form of contortion will be better\r\nunderstood from the accompanying figure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11.\r\n\r\nSECTION OF CONTORTED DRIFT NEAR MUSSELBURGH.\r\n\r\n_a_ Boulder Clay; _b_ Laminated Clay; _c_ Sand, Gravel, and Clay,\r\ncontorted.\r\n\r\nDepth of Section, twenty-two feet.—H.

The great defect of such sections is that they\r\ndo not lay open a sufficient depth of surface. They may, no doubt,\r\nrepresent pretty accurately the character and order of the more recent\r\ndeposits which overlie the boulder clay, but we are hardly warranted\r\nin concluding that the succession of deposits belonging to the earlier\r\npart of the glacial epoch, the period of the true till, is fully\r\nexhibited in such limited sections.\r\n\r\nSuppose, for example, the glacial epoch proper—the time of the lower\r\nboulder clay—to have consisted of a succession of alternate cold and\r\nwarm periods, there would, in such a case, be a series of separate\r\nformations of boulder clay; but we could hardly expect to find on the\r\nflat and open face of the country, where the surface deposits are\r\ngenerally not of great depth, those various formations of till lying\r\nthe one superimposed upon the other. For it is obvious that the till\r\nformed during one ice-period would, as a general rule, be either swept\r\naway or re-ground and laid down by the ice of the succeeding period.\r\nIf the very hardest rocks could not withstand the abrading power\r\nof the enormous masses of ice which passed over the surface of the\r\ncountry during the glacial epoch, it is hardly to be expected that the\r\ncomparatively soft boulder clay would be able to do so. It is probable\r\nthat the boulder clay of one period would be used as grinding materials\r\nby the ice of the succeeding periods. The boulder clay which we find in\r\none continuous mass may, therefore, in many cases, have been ground off\r\nthe rocks underneath at widely different periods.\r\n\r\nIf we wish to find the boulder clays belonging to each of the\r\nsuccessive cold periods lying, the one superimposed on the other in\r\nthe order of time in which they were formed, we must go and search in\r\nsome deep gorge or valley, where the clay has not only accumulated\r\nin enormous masses, but has been partially protected from the\r\ndestructive power of the ice. But it is seldom that the geologist has\r\nan opportunity of seeing a complete section down to the rock-head in\r\nsuch a place. In fact, excepting by bores for minerals, or by shafts\r\nof pits, the surface, to a depth of one or two hundred feet, is never\r\npassed through or laid open.\r\n\r\n_Examination of Drift by Borings._—With the view of ascertaining if\r\nadditional light would be cast on the sequence of events, during the\r\nformation of the boulder clay, by an examination of the journals of\r\nbores made through a great depth of surface deposits, a collection\r\nof about 250 bores, put down in all parts of the mining districts\r\nof Scotland, was made. An examination of these bores shows most\r\nconclusively that the opinion that the boulder clay, or lower till, is\r\none great undivided formation, is wholly erroneous.\r\n\r\nThese 250 bores, as already stated,[280] represent a total thickness\r\nof 21,348 feet, giving 86 feet as the mean thickness of the deposits\r\npassed through. Twenty of these bores have one boulder clay, with beds\r\nof stratified sand or gravel beneath the clay; 25 have 2 boulder clays,\r\nwith stratified beds of sand and gravel between; 10 have 3 boulder\r\nclays; one has 4 boulder clays; 2 have 5 boulder clays; and one has no\r\nfewer than 6 separate masses of boulder clay, with stratified beds of\r\nsand and gravel between; 16 have two or three separate boulder clays,\r\ndiffering altogether in colour and hardness, without any stratified\r\nbeds between. We have, therefore, out of 250 bores, 75 of them\r\nrepresenting a condition of things wholly different from that exhibited\r\nto the geologist in ordinary sections.\r\n\r\nThese bores bear testimony to the conclusion that the glacial epoch\r\nconsisted of a succession of cold and warm periods, and not of one\r\ncontinuous and unbroken period of ice, as was at one time generally\r\nsupposed.\r\n\r\nThe full details of the character of the deposits passed through by\r\nthese bores, and their bearing on the history of the glacial epoch,\r\nhave been given by Mr. James Bennie, in an interesting paper read\r\nbefore the Glasgow Geological Society,[281] to which I would refer\r\nall those interested in the subject of surface geology. But it is not\r\nto the mere contents of the bores that I wish at present to direct\r\nattention, but to a new and important result, to which they have\r\nunexpectedly led.\r\n\r\n_Buried River Channel, Kilsyth to Grangemouth, Firth of Forth._—These\r\nborings reveal the existence of a deep pre-glacial, or perhaps\r\ninter-glacial, trough or hollow, extending from the Clyde above Bowling\r\nacross the country by Kilsyth, along the valley of the Forth and Clyde\r\nCanal, to the Firth of Forth at Grangemouth. This trough is filled up\r\nwith immense deposits of mud, sand, gravel, and boulder clay. These\r\ndeposits not only fill it up, but they cover it over to such an extent\r\nthat it is absolutely impossible to find on the surface a single trace\r\nof it; and had it not been for borings, and other mining operations,\r\nits existence would probably never have been known. In places where the\r\nbottom of the trough is perhaps 200 feet below the sea-level, we find\r\non the surface not a hollow, but often an immense ridge or elliptical\r\nknoll of sand, gravel, or boulder clay, rising sometimes to 150 or 200\r\nfeet above the present sea-level.\r\n\r\nI need not here enter into any minute details regarding the form,\r\ndepth, and general outline of this trough, or of the character of\r\nthe deposits covering it, these having already been described by Mr.\r\nBennie, but shall proceed to the consideration of circumstances which\r\nseem to throw light on the physical origin of this curious hollow,\r\nand to the proof which it unexpectedly affords that Scotland, during\r\nprobably an early part of the glacial epoch, stood higher in relation\r\nto the sea-level than it does at present; or rather, as I would be\r\ndisposed to express it, the sea stood much lower than at present.\r\n\r\nFrom the fact that all along the line of this trough the surface of the\r\ncountry is covered with enormous beds of stratified sands and gravels\r\nof marine origin, which proves that the sea must have at a recent\r\nperiod occupied the valley, my first impression was that this hollow\r\nhad been scooped out by the sea. This conclusion appeared at first\r\nsight quite natural, for at the time that the sea filled the valley,\r\nowing to the Gulf-stream impinging on our western shores, a strong\r\ncurrent would probably then pass through from the Atlantic on the west\r\nto the German Ocean on the east. However, considerations soon began to\r\nsuggest themselves wholly irreconcilable with this hypothesis.\r\n\r\nThe question immediately arose, if the tendency of the sea occupying\r\nthe valley is to deepen it, by wearing down its rocky bottom, and\r\nremoving the abraded materials, then why is the valley filled up to\r\nsuch a prodigious extent with marine deposits? Does not the fact of the\r\nwhole valley being filled up from sea to sea with marine deposits to a\r\ndepth of from 100 to 200 feet, and in some places, to even 400 feet,\r\nshow that the tendency of the sea filling this valley is to silt it up\r\nrather than to deepen it? What conceivable change of conditions could\r\naccount for operations so diverse?\r\n\r\nThat the sea could not have cut out this trough, is, however,\r\nsusceptible of direct proof. The height of the surface of the valley\r\nat the watershed or highest part, about a mile to the east of\r\nKilsyth, where the Kelvin and the Bonny Water, running in opposite\r\ndirections,—the one west into the Clyde, and the other east into the\r\nCarron,—take their rise, is 160 feet above the sea-level. Consequently,\r\nbefore the sea could pass through the valley at present, the sea-level\r\nwould require to be raised 160 feet.\r\n\r\nBut in discussing the question as to the origin of this pre-glacial\r\nhollow, we must suppose the surface deposits of the valley all removed,\r\nfor this hollow was formed before these deposits were laid down. Let\r\nus take the average depth of these deposits at the watershed to be 50\r\nfeet. It follows that, assuming the hollow in question to have been\r\nformed by the sea, the sea-level at the time must have been at least\r\n110 feet higher than at present.\r\n\r\nWere the surface deposits of the country entirely removed, the district\r\nto the west and north-west of Glasgow would be occupied by a sea\r\nwhich would stretch from the Kilpatrick Hills, north of Duntocher,\r\nto Paisley, a distance of about five miles, and from near Houston to\r\nwithin a short way of Kirkintilloch, a distance of more than twelve\r\nmiles. This basin would contain a few small islands and sunken rocks,\r\nbut its mean depth, as determined from a great number of surface bores\r\nobtained over its whole area, would be not much under 70 or 80 feet.\r\nBut we shall, however, take the depth at only 50 feet. Now, if we raise\r\nthe sea-level so as to allow the water just barely to flow over the\r\nwatershed of the valley, the sea in this basin would therefore be 160\r\nfeet deep. Let us now see what would be the condition of things on the\r\neast end of the valley. The valley, for several miles to the east of\r\nKilsyth, continues very narrow, but on reaching Larbert it suddenly\r\nopens into the broad and flat carse lands through which the Forth and\r\nCarron wind. The average depth at which the sea would stand at present\r\nin this tract of country, were the surface removed, as ascertained from\r\nbores, would be at least 100 feet, or about double that in the western\r\nbasin. Consequently, when the sea was sufficiently high to pass over\r\nthe watershed, the water would be here 210 feet in depth, and several\r\nmiles in breadth.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: PLATE VII.\r\n\r\n  W. & A. K. Johnston Edinb^r. and London.\r\n\r\n  CHART OF THE MIDLAND VALLEY, SHOWING BURIED RIVER CHANNELS.\r\n\r\n  _The blue parts represent the area which would be covered by sea\r\n  were the land submerged to the extent of 200 feet. The heavy black\r\n  lines A and B represent the buried River Channels._]\r\n\r\nBut in order to have a current of some strength passing through the\r\nvalley, let us suppose the sea at the time to have stood 150 feet\r\nhigher in relation to the land than at present. This would give 40 feet\r\nas the depth of the sea on the watershed, and 200 feet as the depth in\r\nthe western basin, and 250 feet as the depth in the eastern.\r\n\r\nAn examination of the Ordnance Survey map of the district will show\r\nthat the 200 feet contour lines which run along each side of the valley\r\nfrom Kilsyth to Castlecary come, in several places, to within one-third\r\nof a mile of each other. From an inspection of the ground, I found\r\nthat, even though the surface deposits were removed off the valley, it\r\nwould not sensibly affect the contours at those places. It is therefore\r\nevident that though the sea may have stood even 200 feet higher than at\r\npresent, the breadth of the strait at the watershed and several other\r\npoints could not have exceeded one-third of a mile. It is also evident\r\nthat at those places the current would be flowing with the greatest\r\nvelocity, for here it was not only narrowest, but also shallowest. A\r\nreference to Plate VII. will show the form of the basins. The stippled\r\nportion, coloured blue, represents the area which would be covered by\r\nthe sea were the land submerged to the extent of 200 feet.\r\n\r\nLet us take the breadth of the current in the western basin at, say,\r\nthree miles. This is two miles less than the breadth of the basin\r\nitself. Suppose the current at the narrow parts between Kilsyth and\r\nCastlecary to have had a velocity of, say, five miles an hour. Now, as\r\nthe mean velocity of the current at the various parts of its course\r\nwould be inversely proportionate to the sectional areas of those parts,\r\nit therefore follows that the mean velocity of the current in the\r\nwestern basin would be only 1/45th of what it was in the narrow pass\r\nbetween Kilsyth and Castlecary. This would give a mile in nine hours\r\nas the velocity of the water in the western basin. In the eastern\r\nbasin the mean velocity of the current, assuming its breadth to be the\r\nsame as in the western, would be only a mile in eleven hours. In the\r\ncentral part of the current the velocity at the surface would probably\r\nbe considerably above the mean, but at the sides and bottom it would,\r\nno doubt, be under the mean. In fact, in these two basins the current\r\nwould be almost insensible.\r\n\r\nThe effect of such a current would simply be to widen and deepen the\r\nvalley all along that part between Kilsyth and Castlecary where the\r\ncurrent would be flowing with considerable rapidity. But it would\r\nhave little or no effect in deepening the basins at each end, but the\r\nreverse. It would tend rather to silt them up. If the current flowed\r\nfrom west to east, the materials removed from the narrow part between\r\nKilsyth and Castlecary, where the velocity of the water was great,\r\nwould be deposited when the current almost disappeared in the eastern\r\npart of the valley. Sediment carried by a current flowing at the rate\r\nof five miles an hour, would not remain in suspension when the velocity\r\nbecame reduced to less than five miles a day.\r\n\r\nBut even supposing it were shown that the sea under such conditions\r\ncould have deepened the valley along the whole distance from the Clyde\r\nto the Forth, still this would not explain the origin of the trough\r\nin question. What we are in search of is not the origin of the valley\r\nitself, but the origin of a deep and narrow hollow running along\r\nthe bottom of it. A sea filling the whole valley, and flowing with\r\nconsiderable velocity, would, under certain conditions, no doubt deepen\r\nand widen it, but it would not cut out along its bottom a deep, narrow\r\ntrough, with sides often steep, and in some places perpendicular and\r\neven overhanging.\r\n\r\nThis hollow is evidently an old river-bed scooped out of the rocky\r\nvalley by a stream, flowing probably during an early part of the\r\nglacial period.\r\n\r\nDuring the latter part of the summer of 1868, I spent two or three\r\nweeks of my holidays in tracing the course of this buried trough from\r\nKilsyth to the river Forth at Grangemouth, and I found unmistakable\r\nevidence that the eastern portion of it, stretching from the watershed\r\nto the Forth, had been cut out, not by the sea, but by a stream which\r\nmust have followed almost the present course of the Bonny Water.\r\n\r\nI found that this deep hollow enters the Forth a few hundred yards to\r\nthe north of Grangemouth Harbour, at the extraordinary depth of 260\r\nfeet below the present sea-level. At the period when the sea occupied\r\nthe valley of the Forth and Clyde Canal, the bottom of the trough at\r\nthis spot would therefore be upwards of 400 feet below the level of the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nA short distance to the west of Grangemouth, and also at Carron,\r\nseveral bores were put down in lines almost at right angles across\r\nthe trough, and by this means we have been enabled to form a pretty\r\naccurate estimate of its depth, breadth, and shape at those places. I\r\nshall give the details of one of those sections.\r\n\r\nBetween Towncroft Farm and the river Carron, a bore was put down to\r\nthe depth of 273 feet before the rock was reached. About 150 yards to\r\nthe north of this there is another bore, giving 234 feet as the depth\r\nto the rock; 150 yards still further north the depth of the surface\r\ndeposits, as determined by a third bore, is 155 feet. This last bore is\r\nevidently outside of the hollow, for one about 150 yards north of it\r\ngives the same depth of surface, which seems to be about its average\r\ndepth for a mile or two around. About half a mile to the south of the\r\nhollow at this place the surface deposits are 150 feet deep. From a\r\nnumber of bores obtained at various points within a circuit of 1½\r\nmiles, the surface appears to have a pretty uniform depth of 150 feet\r\nor thereby. For the particulars of these “bores” I am indebted to the\r\nkindness of Mr. Mackay, of Grangemouth.\r\n\r\nTo the south of the trough (see Fig. 12) there is a fault running\r\nnearly parallel to it, having a down-throw to the north, and cutting\r\noff the coal and accompanying strata to the south. But an inspection of\r\nthe section will show that the hollow in question is no way due to the\r\nfault, but has been scooped out of the solid strata.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 12.\r\n\r\n  SECTION OF BURIED RIVER-BED NEAR TOWNCROFT FARM, GRANGEMOUTH.]\r\n\r\nThe main coal wrought extensively here is cut off by the trough,\r\nas will be seen from the section. Mr. Dawson, of Carron Iron Works,\r\ninforms me that at Carronshore pit, about a mile and a quarter above\r\nwhere this section is taken, the coal was found to be completely cut\r\noff by this trough. In one of the workings of this pit, about forty\r\nyears ago, the miners cut into the trough at 40 fathoms below the\r\nsurface, when the sand rushed in with irresistible pressure, and filled\r\nthe working. Again, about a mile below where the section is taken,\r\nor about two miles below Carronshore, and just at the spot where the\r\ntrough enters the Firth, it was also cut into in one of the workings of\r\nthe Heuck pit at a depth of 40 fathoms from the surface. Fortunately,\r\nhowever, at this point the trough is filled with boulder clay instead\r\nof sand, and no damage was sustained. Here, for a distance of two\r\nmiles, the Main coal and “Upper Coxroad” are cut off by this hollow; or\r\nrather, I should say this hollow has been cut through the coal-seams.\r\nThe “Under Coxroad,” lying about 14 fathoms below the position of the\r\n“Main” coal, as will be seen in the descriptive section (Fig. 12), is\r\nnot reached by the trough, and passes undisturbed under it.\r\n\r\nThis hollow would seem to narrow considerably as it recedes westwards,\r\nfor at Carronshore pit-shaft the surface is 138 feet deep; but not much\r\nover 150 yards to the south of this is the spot where the coal was cut\r\noff by the trough at a depth of 40 fathoms or 240 feet. Here it deepens\r\nupwards of 100 feet in little more than 150 yards. That it is narrow at\r\nthis place is proved by the fact, that a bore put down near Carronbank,\r\na little to the south, shows the surface to be only 156 feet deep.\r\n\r\nIn the section (Fig. 12) the line described as “150 _feet above\r\nsea-level_” registers the height of the sea-level at the time when\r\nthe central valley was occupied by sea 40 feet deep at the watershed.\r\nNow, if this hollow, which extends right along the whole length of\r\nthe valley, had been cut out by the sea, the surface of the rock 150\r\nfeet below the present surface of the ground would be the sea-bottom\r\nat the time, and the line marked “150 _feet above sea-level_” would be\r\nthe surface of the sea. The sea would therefore be here 300 feet deep\r\nfor several miles around. It cannot be supposed that the sea acting on\r\na broad flat plain of several miles in extent should cut out a deep,\r\nnarrow hollow, like the one exhibited in the section, and leave the\r\nrest of the plain a flat sea-bottom.\r\n\r\nAnd it must be observed, that this is not a hollow cut merely in a\r\nsea-beach, but one extending westward to Kilsyth. Now, if this hollow\r\nwas cut out by the sea, it must have been done, not by the waves\r\nbeating on the beach, but by a current flowing through the valley.\r\nThe strongest current that could possibly pass through the narrow\r\npart between Kilsyth and Castlecary would be wholly insensible when it\r\nreached Grangemouth, where the water was 300 feet deep, and several\r\nmiles broad. Consequently, it is impossible that the current could have\r\nscooped out the hollow represented in the section.\r\n\r\nAgain, if this hollow had been scooped out by the sea, it ought to\r\nbe deepest between Kilsyth and Castlecary, where the current was\r\nnarrowest; but the reverse is actually the case. It is shallowest at\r\nthe place where the current was narrowest, and deepest at the two\r\nends where the current was broadest. In the case of a trough cut by\r\na sea current, we must estimate its depth from the level of the sea.\r\nIts depth is the depth of the water in it while it was being scooped\r\nout. The bottom of the trough in the highest and narrowest part of\r\nthe valley east of Kilsyth is 40 feet above the present sea-level.\r\nConsequently, its depth at this point at the period in question, when\r\nthe sea-level was 150 feet higher than at present, would be 110 feet.\r\nThe bottom of the trough at Grangemouth is 260 feet below the present\r\nsea-level; add to this 150 feet, and we have 410 feet as its depth here\r\nat the time in question. If this hollow was scooped out by the sea,\r\nhow then does it thus happen that at the place where the current was\r\nstrongest and confined to a narrow channel by hills on each side, it\r\ncut its channel to a depth of only 110 feet, whereas at the place where\r\nit had scarcely any motion it has cut, on a flat and open plain several\r\nmiles broad, a channel to a depth of 410 feet?\r\n\r\nBut, suppose we estimate the relative amount of work performed by the\r\nsea at Kilsyth and Grangemouth, not by the actual depth of the bottom\r\nof the trough at these two places below the sea-level at the time that\r\nthe work was performed, but by the present actual depth of the bottom\r\nof the trough below the rocky surface of the valley, this will still\r\nnot help us out of the difficulty. Taking, as before, the height of the\r\nrocky bed of the valley at the watershed at 110 feet above the present\r\nsea-level, and the bottom of the trough at 40 feet, this gives 70 feet\r\nas the depth scooped out of the rock at that place. The depth of the\r\ntrough at Grangemouth below the rocky surface is 118 feet. Here we have\r\nonly 70 feet cut out at the only place where there was any resistance\r\nto the current, as well as the place where it possessed any strength;\r\nwhereas at Grangemouth, where there was no resistance, and no strength\r\nof current, 118 feet has been scooped out. Such a result as this is\r\ndiametrically opposed to all that we know of the dynamics of running\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nWe may, therefore, conclude that it is physically impossible that this\r\nhollow could have been cut out by the sea.\r\n\r\nOwing to the present tendency among geologists to attribute effects\r\nof this kind to ocean-currents, I have been induced to enter thus at\r\nmuch greater length than would otherwise have been necessary into the\r\nfacts and arguments against the possibility of the hollow having been\r\nexcavated by the sea. In the present case the discussion is specially\r\nnecessary, for here we have positive evidence of the sea having\r\noccupied the valley for ages, along which this channel has been cut.\r\nConsequently, unless it is proved that the sea could not possibly have\r\nscooped out the channel, most geologists would be inclined to attribute\r\nit to the sea-current which is known to have passed through the valley\r\nrather than to any other cause.\r\n\r\nBut that it is a hollow of denudation, and has been scooped out by some\r\nagent, is perfectly certain. By what agent, then, has the erosion been\r\nmade? The only other cause to which it can possibly be attributed is\r\neither land-ice or river-action.\r\n\r\nThe supposition that this hollow was scooped out by ice is not more\r\ntenable than the supposition that the work has been done by the sea.\r\nA glacier filling up the entire valley and descending into the German\r\nOcean would unquestionably not only deepen the valley, but would grind\r\ndown the surface over which it passed all along its course. But such a\r\nglacier would not cut a deep and narrow channel along the bottom of the\r\nvalley. A glacier that could do this would be a small and narrow one,\r\njust sufficiently large to fill this narrow trough; for if it were\r\nmuch broader than the trough, it would grind away its edges, and make a\r\nbroad trough instead of a narrow one. But a glacier so small and narrow\r\nas only to fill the trough, descending from the hills at Kilsyth to the\r\nsea at Grangemouth, a distance of fifteen miles, is very improbable\r\nindeed. The resistance to the advance of the ice along such a slope\r\nwould cause the ice to accumulate till probably the whole valley would\r\nbe filled.[282]\r\n\r\nThere is no other way of explaining the origin of this hollow, but\r\nupon the supposition of its being an old river-bed. But there is\r\ncertainly nothing surprising in the fact of finding an old watercourse\r\nunder the boulder clay and other deposits. Unless the present contour\r\nof the country be very different from what it was at the earlier\r\npart of the glacial epoch, there must have then been watercourses\r\ncorresponding to the Bonny Water and the river Carron of the present\r\nday; and that the remains of these should be found under the present\r\nsurface deposits is not surprising, seeing that these deposits are of\r\nsuch enormous thickness. When water began to flow down our valleys, on\r\nthe disappearance of the ice at the close of the glacial epoch, the\r\nCarron and the Bonny Water would not be able to regain their old rocky\r\nchannels, but would be obliged to cut, as they have done, new courses\r\nfor themselves on the surface of the deposits under which their old\r\nones lay buried.\r\n\r\nAlthough an old pre-glacial or inter-glacial river-bed is in itself an\r\nobject of much interest and curiosity, still, it is not on that account\r\nthat I have been induced to enter so minutely into the details of this\r\nburied hollow. There is something of far more importance attached to\r\nthis hollow than the mere fact of its being an old watercourse. For the\r\nfact that it enters the Firth of Forth at a depth of 260 feet below the\r\npresent sea-level, proves incontestably that at the time this hollow\r\nwas occupied by a stream, _the land must have stood at least between\r\n200 and 300 feet higher in relation to the sea-level than at present_.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the old surface of the country in the neighbourhood\r\nof Grangemouth, out of which this ancient stream cut its channel,\r\nis at least 150 feet below the present sea-level. Now, unless this\r\nsurface had been above the sea-level at that time, the stream would\r\nnot have cut a channel in it. But it has not merely cut a channel, but\r\ncut one to a depth of 120 feet. It is impossible that this channel\r\ncould have been occupied by a river of sufficient volume to fill it.\r\nIt is not at all likely that the river which scooped it out could have\r\nbeen much larger than the Carron of the present day, for the area of\r\ndrainage, from the very formation of the country, could not have been\r\nmuch greater above Grangemouth than at present. An elevation of the\r\nland would, no doubt, increase the area of the drainage of the stream\r\nmeasured from its source to where it might then enter the sea, because\r\nit would increase the length of the stream; but it would neither\r\nincrease the area of drainage, nor the length of the stream above\r\nGrangemouth. Kilsyth would be the watershed then as it is now.\r\n\r\nWhat we have here is not the mere channel which had been occupied by\r\nthe ancient Carron, but the valley in which the channel lay. It may,\r\nperhaps, be more properly termed a buried river valley; formed, no\r\ndoubt, like other river valleys by the denuding action of rain and\r\nriver.\r\n\r\nThe river Carron at present is only a few feet deep. Suppose the\r\nancient Carron, which flowed in this old channel, to have been say 10\r\nfeet deep. This would show that the land in relation to the sea at that\r\ntime must have stood at least 250 feet higher than at present. If 10\r\nfeet was the depth of this old river, and Grangemouth the place where\r\nit entered the sea, then 250 feet would be the extent of the elevation.\r\nBut it is probable that Grangemouth was not the mouth of the river; it\r\nwould likely be merely the place where it joined the river Forth of\r\nthat period. We have every reason to believe that the bed of the German\r\nOcean was then dry land, and that the Forth, Tay, Tyne, and other\r\nBritish rivers flowing eastward, as Mr. Godwin-Austin supposes, were\r\ntributaries to the Rhine, which at that time was a huge river passing\r\ndown the bed of the German Ocean, and entering the Atlantic to the west\r\nof the Orkney Islands. That the German Ocean, as well as the sea-bed of\r\nthe Western Hebrides, was dry land at a very recent geological period,\r\nis so well known, that, on this point, I need not enter into details.\r\nWe may, therefore, conclude that the river Forth, after passing\r\nGrangemouth, would continue to descend until it reached the Rhine. If,\r\nby means of borings, we could trace the old bed of the Forth and the\r\nRhine up to the point where the latter entered the Atlantic, in the\r\nsame way as we have done the Bonny Water and the Carron, we should no\r\ndoubt obtain a pretty accurate estimate as to the height at which the\r\nland stood at that remote period. Nothing whatever, I presume, is known\r\nas to the depth of the deposits covering the bed of the German Ocean\r\nalong what was then the course of the Rhine. It must, no doubt, be\r\nsomething enormous. We are also in ignorance as to the thickness of the\r\ndeposits covering the ancient bed of the Forth. A considerable number\r\nof bores have been put down at various parts of the Firth of Forth in\r\nconnection with the contemplated railway bridge across the Firth, but\r\nin none of those bores has the rock been reached. Bores to a depth of\r\n175 feet have been made without even passing through the deposits of\r\nsilt which probably overlie an enormous thickness of sand and boulder\r\nclay. Even in places where the water is 40 fathoms deep and quite\r\nnarrow, the bottom is not rock but silt.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, satisfactory to find on the land a confirmation of\r\nwhat has long been believed from evidence found in the seas around our\r\nisland, that at a very recent period the sea-level in relation to the\r\nland must have been some hundreds of feet lower than at the present\r\nday, and that our island must have at that time formed a part of the\r\ngreat eastern continent.\r\n\r\nA curious fact was related to me by Mr. Stirling, the manager of the\r\nGrangemouth collieries, which seems to imply a great elevation of the\r\nland at a period long posterior to the time when this channel was\r\nscooped out.\r\n\r\nIn sinking a pit at Orchardhead, about a mile to the north of\r\nGrangemouth, the workmen came upon the boulder clay after passing\r\nthrough about 110 feet of sand, clay, and gravel. On the upper surface\r\nof the boulder clay they found cut out what Mr. Stirling believes\r\nto have been an old watercourse. It was 17 feet deep, and not much\r\nbroader. The sides of the channel appear to have been smooth and\r\nwater-worn, and the whole was filled with a fine sharp sand beautifully\r\nstratified. As this channel lay about 100 feet below the present\r\nsea-level, it shows that if it actually be an old watercourse, it must\r\nhave been scooped out at a time when the land in relation to the sea\r\nstood at least 100 feet higher than at present.\r\n\r\n_Buried River Channel from Kilsyth to the Clyde._—In all probability\r\nthe western half of this great hollow, extending from the watershed\r\nat Kilsyth to the Clyde, is also an old river channel, probably\r\nthe ancient bed of the Kelvin. This point cannot, however, be\r\nsatisfactorily settled until a sufficient number of bores have been\r\nmade along the direct line of the hollow, so as to determine with\r\ncertainty its width and general form and extent. That the western\r\nchannel is as narrow as the eastern is very probable. It has been\r\nfound that its sides at some places, as, for example, at Garscadden,\r\nare very steep. At one place the north side is actually an overhanging\r\nburied precipice, the bottom of which is about 200 feet below the\r\nsea-level. We know also that the coal and ironstone in that quarter are\r\ncut through by the trough, and the miners there have to exercise great\r\ncaution in driving their workings, in case they might cut into it. The\r\ntrough along this district is filled with sand, and is known to the\r\nminers of the locality as the “sand-dyke.” To cut into running sand at\r\na depth of 40 or 50 fathoms is a very dangerous proceeding, as will be\r\nseen from the details given in Mr. Bennie’s paper[283] of a disaster\r\nwhich occurred about twenty years ago to a pit near Duntocher, where\r\nthis trough was cut into at a depth of 51 fathoms from the surface.\r\n\r\nThe depth of this hollow, below the present sea-level at Drumry, as\r\nascertained by a bore put down, is 230 feet. For several miles to the\r\neast the depth is nearly as great. Consequently, if this hollow be an\r\nold river-bed, the ancient river that flowed in it must have entered\r\nthe Clyde at a depth of more than 200 feet below the present sea-level;\r\nand if so, then it follows that the rocky bed of the ancient Clyde must\r\nlie buried under more than 200 feet of surface deposits from Bowling\r\ndownwards to the sea. Whether this is the case or not we have no means\r\nat present of determining. The manager to the Clyde Trustees informs\r\nme, however, that in none of the borings or excavations which have\r\nbeen made has the rock ever been reached from Bowling downwards. The\r\nprobability is, that this deep hollow passes downwards continuously to\r\nthe sea on the western side of the island as on the eastern.[284]\r\n\r\nThe following journals of a few of the borings will give the reader an\r\nidea of the character of the deposits filling the channels. The beds\r\nwhich are believed to be boulder clay are printed in italics:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    BORINGS MADE THROUGH THE DEPOSITS FILLING THE WESTERN CHANNEL.\r\n\r\n              Bore, Drumry Farm, on

Are they of marine or\r\nof freshwater origin? Mr. Dugald Bell[285] and Mr. James Geikie[286]\r\nare inclined to believe that as far as regards those filling the\r\nwestern channel they are of lacustrine origin; that they were formed\r\nin lakes, produced by the damming back of the water resulting from the\r\nmelting of the ice. I am, however, for the following reasons, inclined\r\nto agree with Mr. Bennie’s opinion that they are of marine origin.\r\nIt will be seen, by a comparison of the journals of the borings made\r\nthrough the deposits in the eastern channel with those in the western,\r\nthat they are of a similar character; so that, if we suppose those in\r\nthe western channel to be of freshwater origin, we may from analogy\r\ninfer the same in reference to the origin of those in the eastern\r\nchannel. But, as we have already seen, the deposits extend to the Firth\r\nof Forth at Grangemouth, where they are met with at a depth of 260 feet\r\nbelow sea-level. Consequently, if we conclude them to be of freshwater\r\norigin, we are forced to the assumption, not that the water formed by\r\nthe melted ice was dammed back, but that the sea itself was dammed\r\nback, and that by a wall extending to a depth of not less than two or\r\nthree hundred feet, so as to allow of a lake being formed in which the\r\ndeposits might accumulate; assuming, of course, that the absolute level\r\nof the land was the same then as it is now.\r\n\r\nBut as regards the stratified deposits of Grangemouth, we have direct\r\nevidence of their marine origin down to the bottom of the Red Clay that\r\nimmediately overlies the till and its intercalated beds, which on an\r\naverage is no less than 85 feet, and in some cases 100 feet, below the\r\npresent surface. From this deposit, Foraminifera, indicating an arctic\r\ncondition of sea, were determined by Mr. David Robertson. Marine shells\r\nwere also found in this bed, and along with them the remains of a\r\nseal, which was determined by Professor Turner to be of an exceedingly\r\narctic type, thus proving that these deposits were not only marine but\r\nglacial.\r\n\r\nDirect fossil evidence as to the character of the deposits occupying\r\nthe western basin, is, however, not so abundant, but this may be owing\r\nto the fact that during the sinking of pits, no special attention\r\nhas been paid to the matter. At Blairdardie, in sinking a pit-shaft\r\nthrough these deposits, shells were found in a bed of sand between two\r\nimmense masses of boulder clay. The position of this bed will be better\r\nunderstood from the following section of the pit-shaft:—\r\n\r\n                                        Feet.\r\n  Surface soil                              4½\r\n  Blue clay                                 9\r\n  Hard stony clay                          69\r\n  Sand with, a few _shells_                 3\r\n  Stony clay and boulders                  46½\r\n  Mud and running sand                     11\r\n  Hard clay, boulders, and broken rock     27\r\n                                          ———\r\n                                          170\r\n\r\nBut as the shells were not preserved, we have, of course, no means of\r\ndetermining whether they were of marine or of freshwater origin.\r\n\r\nIn another pit, at a short distance from the above, _Cyprina Islandica_\r\nwas found in a bed at the depth of 54 feet below the surface.[287]\r\n\r\nIn a paper read by Mr. James Smith, of Jordanhill, to the Geological\r\nSociety, April 24th, 1850,[288] the discovery is recorded of a\r\nstratified bed containing _Tellina proxima_ intercalated between two\r\ndistinct boulder clays. The bed was discovered by Mr. James Russell in\r\nsinking a well at Chapelhall, near Airdrie. Its height above sea-level\r\nwas 510 feet. The character of the shell not only proves the marine\r\norigin of the bed, but also the existence of a submergence to that\r\nextent during an inter-glacial period.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the difficulty besetting the theory of the marine\r\norigin of the deposits is this. The intercalated boulder clays bear\r\nno marks of stratification, and are evidently the true unstratified\r\ntill formed when the country was covered by ice. But the fact that\r\nthese beds are both underlaid and overlaid by stratified deposits\r\nwould, on the marine theory, imply not merely the repeated appearance\r\nand disappearance of the ice, but also the repeated submergence and\r\nemergence of the land. If the opinion be correct that the submergences\r\nand emergences of the glacial epoch were due to depressions and\r\nelevations of the land, and not to oscillations of sea-level, then\r\nthe difficulty in question is, indeed, a formidable one. But, on the\r\nother hand, if the theory of submergences propounded in Chapters XXIII.\r\nand XXIV. be the true one, the difficulty entirely disappears. The\r\nexplanation is as follows, viz., during a cold period of the glacial\r\nepoch, when the winter solstice was in aphelion, the low grounds would\r\nbe covered with ice, under which a mass of till would be formed.\r\nAfter the cold began to decrease, and the ice to disappear from the\r\nplains, the greatest rise of the ocean, for reasons already stated,\r\nwould take place. The till covering the low grounds would be submerged\r\nto a considerable depth and would soon be covered over by mud, sand,\r\nand gravel, carried down by streams from the high ground, which, at\r\nthe time, would still be covered with snow and ice. In course of time\r\nthe sea would begin to sink and a warm and continental period of,\r\nperhaps, from 6,000 to 10,000 years, would follow, when the sea would\r\nbe standing at a much lower level than at present. The warm period\r\nwould be succeeded by a second cold period, and the ice would again\r\ncover the land and form a second mass of till, which, in some places,\r\nwould rest directly on the former till, while in other places it would\r\nbe laid down upon the surface of the sands and gravels overlying the\r\nfirst mass. Again, on the disappearance of the ice the second mass of\r\ntill would be covered over in like manner by mud, sand, and gravel, and\r\nso on, while the eccentricity of the earth’s orbit continued at a high\r\nvalue. In this way we might have three, four, five, or more masses of\r\ntill separated by beds of sand and gravel.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from Table IV. of the eccentricity of the earth’s\r\norbit, given in Chapter XIX., that the former half of that long\r\nsuccession of cold and warm periods, known as the glacial epoch,\r\nwas much more severe than the latter half. That is to say, in the\r\nformer half the accumulation of ice during the cold periods, and its\r\ndisappearance in polar regions during the warm periods, would be\r\ngreater than in the latter half. It was probable that it was during\r\nthe warm periods of the earlier part of the glacial epoch that the two\r\nburied channels of the Midland valley were occupied by rivers, and that\r\nit was during the latter and less severe part of the glacial epoch that\r\nthese channels became filled up with that remarkable series of deposits\r\nwhich we have been considering.\r\n\r\n_Other buried River Channels._—A good many examples of buried river\r\nchannels have been found both in Scotland and in England, though none\r\nof them of so remarkable a character as the two occupying the valley\r\nof the Forth and Clyde Canal which have been just described. I may,\r\nhowever, briefly refer to one or two localities where some of these\r\noccur.\r\n\r\n(1.) An ancient buried river channel, similar to the one extending\r\nfrom Kilsyth to Grangemouth, exists in the coal-fields of Durham,\r\nand is known to miners in the district as the “Wash.” Its course was\r\ntraced by Mr. Nicholas Wood, F.G.S., and Mr. E. F. Boyd, from Durham\r\nto Newcastle, a distance of fourteen miles.[289] It traverses, after\r\npassing the city of Durham, a portion of the valley of the Wear, passes\r\nChester-le-Street, and then follows the valley of the river Team, and\r\nterminates at the river Tyne. And what is remarkable, it enters the\r\nTyne at a depth of 140 feet below the present level of the sea. This\r\ncurious hollow lies buried, like the Scottish one just alluded to,\r\nunder an enormous mass of drift, and it is only through means of boring\r\nand other mining operations that its character has been revealed. The\r\nbottom and sides of this channel everywhere bear evidence of long\r\nexposure to the abrading influence of water in motion; the rocky bottom\r\nbeing smoothed, furrowed, and water-worn. The river Wear of the present\r\nday flows to the sea over the surface of the drift at an elevation of\r\nmore than 100 feet above this buried river-bed. At the time that this\r\nchannel was occupied by running water the sea-level must have been at\r\nleast 140 feet lower than at present. This old river evidently belongs\r\nto the same continental period as those of Scotland.\r\n\r\n(2.) From extensive borings and excavations, made at the docks of Hull\r\nand Grimsby, it is found that the ancient bed of the Humber is buried\r\nunder more than 100 feet of silt, clay, and gravel. At Hull the bottom\r\nof this buried trough was found to be 110 feet below the sea-level.\r\nAnd what is most interesting at both these places, the remains of a\r\nsubmerged forest was found at a depth of from thirty to fifty feet\r\nbelow the sea-level. In some places two forests were found divided by a\r\nbed of leafy clay from five to fifteen feet thick.\r\n\r\n(3.) In the valleys of Norfolk we also find the same conditions\r\nexhibited. The ancient bed of the Yare and other rivers of this\r\ndistrict enter the sea at a depth of more than 100 feet below the\r\npresent sea-level. At Yarmouth the surface was found 170 feet thick,\r\nand the deep surface extends along the Yare to beyond Norwich. Buried\r\nforests are also found here similar to those on the Humber.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that all our British rivers flow into the sea over their\r\nold buried channels, except in cases where they may have changed their\r\ncourses since the beginning of the glacial epoch.\r\n\r\n(4.) In the Sanquhar Coal Basin, at the foot of the Kello Water, an\r\nold buried river course was found by Mr. B. N. Peach. It ran at right\r\nangles to the Kello, and was filled with boulder clay which cut off the\r\ncoal; but, on driving the mine through the clay, the coal was found in\r\nposition on the other side.\r\n\r\n(5.) An old river course, under the boulder clay, is described by Mr.\r\nMilne Home in his memoir on the Mid-Lothian coal-fields. It has been\r\ntraced out from Niddry away in a N.E. direction by New Craighall. At\r\nNiddry, the hollow is about 100 yards wide and between 60 and 70 feet\r\ndeep. It seems to deepen and widen as it approaches towards the sea,\r\nfor at New Craighall it is about 200 yards wide and 97 feet deep. This\r\nold channel will probably enter the sea about Musselburgh. Like the\r\nchannels in the Midland Valley of Scotland already described, it is so\r\ncompletely filled up by drift that not a trace of it is to be seen on\r\nthe surface. And like these, also, it must have belonged to a period\r\nwhen the sea-level stood much lower than at present.\r\n\r\n(6.) At Hailes’ Quarry, near Edinburgh, there is to be seen a portion\r\nof an ancient watercourse under the boulder drift. A short account\r\nof it was given by Dr. Page in a paper read before the Edinburgh\r\nGeological Society.[290] The superincumbent sandstone, he says, has\r\nbeen cut to a depth of 60 feet. The width of the channel at the surface\r\nvaries from 12 to 14 feet, but gradually narrows to 2 or 3 feet at the\r\nbottom. The sides and bottom are smoothed and polished, and the whole\r\nis now filled with till and boulders.\r\n\r\n(7.) One of the most remarkable buried channels is that along the\r\nValley of Strathmore, supposed to be the ancient bed of the Tay. It\r\nextends from Dunkeld, the south of Blairgowrie, Ruthven, and Forfar,\r\nand enters the German Ocean at Lunan Bay. Its length is about 34 miles.\r\n\r\n“No great river,” says Sir Charles Lyell, “follows this course, but\r\nit is marked everywhere by lakes or ponds, which afford shell-marl,\r\nswamps, and peat moss, commonly surrounded by ridges of detritus from\r\n50 to 70 feet high, consisting in the lower part of till and boulders,\r\nand in the upper of stratified gravels, sand, loam, and clay, in some\r\ninstances curved or contorted.”[291]\r\n\r\n“It evidently marks an ancient line, by which, first, a great glacier\r\ndescended from the mountains to the sea, and by which, secondly, at\r\na later period, the principal water drainage of this country was\r\neffected.”[292]\r\n\r\n(8.) A number of examples of ancient river courses, underneath the\r\nboulder clay, are detailed by Professor Geikie in his glacial drift of\r\nScotland. Some of the cases described by him have acquired additional\r\ninterest from the fact of their bearing decided testimony to the\r\nexistence of inter-glacial warm periods. I shall briefly refer to a few\r\nof the cases described by him.\r\n\r\nIn driving a trial mine in a pit at Chapelhall, near Airdrie, the\r\nworkmen came upon what they believed to be an old river course. At\r\nthe end of the trial mine the ironstone, with its accompanying coal\r\nand fire-clay, were cut off at an angle of about 20° by a stiff,\r\ndark-coloured earth, stuck full of angular pieces of white sandstone,\r\ncoal, and shale, with rounded pebbles of greenstone, basalt, quartz,\r\n&c. Above this lay a fine series of sand and clay beds. Above these\r\nstratified beds lay a depth of 50 or 60 feet of true boulder clay. The\r\nchannel ran in the direction of north-east and south-west. Mr. Russell,\r\nof Chapelhall, informs Professor Geikie that another of the same kind,\r\na mile farther to the north-west, had been traced in some of the pit\r\nworkings.\r\n\r\n“It is clear,” says Professor Geikie, “that whatever may be the true\r\nexplanation of these channels and basins, they unquestionably belong to\r\nthe period of the boulder clay. The Chapelhall basin lies, indeed, in a\r\nhollow of the carboniferous rocks, but its stratified sands and clays\r\nrest on an irregular floor of true till. The old channel near the banks\r\nof the Calder is likewise scooped out of sandstones and shales; but\r\nit has a coating of boulder clay, on which its finely-laminated sands\r\nand clays repose, _as if the channel itself had once been filled with\r\nboulder clay, which was re-excavated to allow of the deposition of the\r\nstratified deposits. In all cases, a thick mantle of coarse, tumultuous\r\nboulder clay buries the whole._”[293]\r\n\r\nProfessor Geikie found between the mouth of the Pease Burn and St.\r\nAbb’s Head, Berwickshire, several ancient buried channels. One at\r\nthe Menzie Cleuch, near Redheugh Shore, was filled to the brim with\r\nboulder clay. Another, the Lumsden Dean, half a mile to the east of\r\nFast Castle, on the bank of the Carmichael Burn, near the parish church\r\nof Carmichael,—an old watercourse of the boulder clay period—is to\r\nbe seen. The valley of the Mouse Water he instances as a remarkable\r\nexample.\r\n\r\nOne or two he found in Ayrshire, and also one on the banks of the Lyne\r\nWater, a tributary of the Tweed.\r\n\r\n(9.) In the valley of the Clyde, above Hamilton, several buried river\r\nchannels have been observed. They are thus described by Mr. James\r\nGeikie:—[294]\r\n\r\n“In the Wishaw district, two deep, winding troughs, filled with sand\r\nand fine gravel, have been traced over a considerable area in the coal\r\nworkings.[295] These troughs form no feature at the surface, but are\r\nentirely concealed below a thick covering of boulder clay. They appear\r\nto be old stream courses, and are in all probability the pre-glacial\r\nravines of the Calder Water and the Tillon Burn. The ‘sand-dyke’ that\r\nrepresents the pre-glacial course of the Calder Water runs for some\r\ndistance parallel to the present course of the stream down to Wishaw\r\nHouse, where it is intersected by the Calder, and the deposits which\r\nchoke it up are well seen in the steep wooded banks below the house\r\nand in the cliff on the opposite side. It next strikes to south-east,\r\nand is again well exposed on the road-side leading down from Wishaw\r\nto the Calder Water. From this point it has been traced underground,\r\nmore or less continuously, as far as Wishaw Ironworks. Beyond this\r\nplace the coal-seams sink to a greater depth, and therefore cease to\r\nbe intersected by the ancient ravine, the course of which, however,\r\nmay still be inferred from the evidence obtained during the sinking\r\nof shafts and trial borings. In all probability it runs south, and\r\nenters the old course of the Clyde a little below Cambusnethan House.\r\nOnly a portion of the old ravine of the Tillon Burn is shown upon the\r\nMap. It is first met with in the coal-workings of Cleland Townhead\r\n(Sheet 31). From this place it winds underground in a southerly\r\ndirection until it is intersected by the present Tillon Burn, a little\r\nnorth of Glencleland (Sheet 31). It now runs to south-west, keeping\r\nparallel to the burn, and crosses the valley of the Calder just\r\nimmediately above the mouth of the Tillon. From this point it can be\r\ntraced in pit-shafts, open-air sections, borings, and coal-workings,\r\nby Ravenscraig, Nether Johnstone, and Robberhall Belting, on to the\r\nCalder Water below Coursington Bridge (Sheet 31). It would thus appear\r\nthat in pre-glacial times the Calder and the Tillon were independent\r\nstreams, and that since glacial times the Calder Water, forsaking its\r\npre-glacial course, has cut its way across the intervening ground,\r\nploughing out deep ravines in the solid rocks, until eventually it\r\nunited with the Tillon. Similar buried stream courses occur at other\r\nplaces. Thus, at Fairholme, near Larkhall, as already mentioned (par.\r\n94), the pre-glacial course of the Avon has been traced in pit-shafts\r\nand borings for some distance to the north. Another old course, filled\r\nup with boulder clay, is exposed in a burn near Plotcock, a mile\r\nsouth-west from Millheugh; and a similar pre-glacial ravine was met\r\nwith in the cement-stone workings at Calderwood.[296] Indeed, it might\r\nbe said with truth that nearly all the rocky ravines through which the\r\nwaters flow, especially in the carboniferous areas, are of post-glacial\r\nage—the pre-glacial courses lying concealed under masses of drift. Most\r\nfrequently, however, the present courses of the streams are partly\r\npre-glacial and partly post-glacial. In the pre-glacial portions the\r\nstreams flow through boulder clay, in the post-glacial reaches their\r\ncourse, as just mentioned, is usually in rocky ravines. The Avon and\r\nthe Calder, with their tributaries, afford numerous illustrations of\r\nthese phenomena.”\r\n\r\nThe question naturally arises, When were those channels scooped out?\r\nTo what geological period must those ancient rivers be referred? It\r\nwill not do to conclude that those channels must be pre-glacial simply\r\nbecause they contain boulder clay. Had the glacial epoch been one\r\nunbroken period of cold, and the boulder clay one continuous formation,\r\nthen the fact of finding boulder clay in those channels would show that\r\nthey were pre-glacial. But when we find undoubted geological evidence\r\nof a warm condition of climate of long continuance, during the severest\r\npart of the glacial epoch, when the ice, to a great extent, must have\r\ndisappeared, and water began to flow as usual down our valleys, all\r\nthat can reasonably be inferred from the fact of finding till in those\r\nchannels, is that they must be older than the till they contain. We\r\ncannot infer that they are older than all the till lying on the face\r\nof the country. The probability, however, is, that some of them are\r\nof pre-glacial and others of inter-glacial origin. That many of these\r\nchannels have been used as watercourses during the glacial epoch, or\r\nrather during warm periods of that epoch, is certain, from the fact\r\nthat they have been filled with boulder clay, then re-excavated, and\r\nfinally filled up again with the clay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\n       THE PHYSICAL CAUSE OF THE MOTION OF GLACIERS.—THEORIES OF\r\n                            GLACIER-MOTION.\r\n\r\n  Why the Question of Glacier-motion has been found to be so\r\n      difficult.—The Regelation Theory.—It accounts for the\r\n      Continuity of a Glacier, but not for its Motion.—Gravitation\r\n      proved by Canon Moseley insufficient to shear the Ice\r\n      of a Glacier.—Mr. Mathew’s Experiment.—No Parallel\r\n      between the bending of an Ice Plank and the shearing\r\n      of a Glacier.—Mr. Ball’s Objection to Canon Moseley’s\r\n      Experiment.—Canon Moseley’s Method of determining the Unit\r\n      of Shear.—Defect of Method.—Motion of a Glacier in some\r\n      Way dependent on Heat.—Canon Moseley’s Theory.—Objections\r\n      to his Theory.—Professor James Thomson’s Theory.—This\r\n      Theory fails to explain Glacier-motion.—De Saussure and\r\n      Hopkins’s “Sliding” Theories.—M.

A glacier moves down a valley\r\nvery much in the same way as a river, the motion being least at the\r\nsides and greatest at the centre, and greater at the surface than at\r\nthe bottom. In a cross section scarcely two particles will be moving\r\nwith the same velocity. Again, a glacier accommodates itself to the\r\ninequalities of the channel in which it moves exactly as a semifluid\r\nor plastic substance would do. So thoroughly does a glacier behave\r\nin the manner of a viscous or plastic body that Professor Forbes was\r\ninduced to believe that viscosity was a property of the ice, and that\r\nin virtue of this property it was enabled to move with a differential\r\nmotion and accommodate itself to all the inequalities of its channel\r\nwithout losing its continuity just as a mass of mud or putty would do.\r\nBut experience proves that ice is a hard and brittle substance far\r\nmore resembling glass than putty. In fact it is one of the most brittle\r\nand unyielding substances in nature. So unyielding is a glacier that\r\nit will snap in two before it will stretch to any perceptible extent.\r\nThis is proved by the fact that crevasses resulting from a strain on\r\nthe glacier consist at first of a simple crack scarcely wide enough to\r\nadmit the blade of a penknife.\r\n\r\nAll the effects which were considered to be due to the viscosity of\r\nthe ice have been fully explained and accounted for on the principle\r\nof fracture and regelation discovered by Faraday. The principle of\r\nregelation explains why the ice moving with a differential motion and\r\naccommodating itself to the inequalities of its channel is yet enabled\r\nto retain its continuity, but it does not account for the _cause_ of\r\nglacier motion. In fact it rather involves the question in deeper\r\nmystery than before. For it is far more difficult to conceive how the\r\nparticles of a hard and brittle solid like that of ice can move with\r\na differential motion, than it is to conceive how this may take place\r\nin the case of a soft and yielding substance. The particles of ice\r\nhave all to be displaced one over another and alongside each other,\r\nand as those particles are rigidly fixed together this connection must\r\nbe broken before the one can slide over the other. _Shearing-force_,\r\nas Canon Moseley shows, comes into play. Were ice a plastic substance\r\nthere would not be much difficulty in understanding how the particles\r\nshould move the one over the other, but it is totally different when\r\nwe conceive ice to be a solid and unyielding substance. The difficulty\r\nin connection with glacier-motion is not to account for the continuity\r\nof the ice, for the principle of regelation fully explains this, but\r\nto show how it is that one particle succeeds in sliding over the over.\r\nThe principle of regelation, instead of assisting to remove this\r\ndifficulty, increases it tenfold. Regelation does not explain the cause\r\nof glacier-motion, but the reverse. It rather tends to show that a\r\nglacier should not move. What, then, is the cause of glacier-motion?\r\nAccording to the regelation theory, gravitation is the impelling\r\ncause. But is gravitation sufficient to _shear_ the ice in the manner\r\nin which it is actually done in a glacier?\r\n\r\nI presume that few who have given much thought to the subject of\r\nglacier-motion have not had some slight misgivings in regard to the\r\ncommonly received theory. There are some facts which I never could\r\nharmonize with this theory. For example, boulder clay is a far looser\r\nsubstance than ice; its shearing-force must be very much less than\r\nthat of ice; yet immense masses of boulder clay will lie immovable for\r\nages on the slope of a hill so steep that one can hardly venture to\r\nclimb it, while a glacier will come crawling down a valley which by\r\nthe eye we could hardly detect to be actually off the level. Again, a\r\nglacier moves faster during the day than during the night, and about\r\ntwice as fast during summer as during winter. Professor Forbes, for\r\nexample, found that the Glacier des Bois near its lower extremity moved\r\nsometimes in December only 11·5 inches daily, while during the month\r\nof July its rate of motion sometimes reached 52·1 inches per day. Why\r\nsuch a difference in the rate of motion between day and night, summer\r\nand winter? The glacier is not heavier during the day than it is\r\nduring the night, or during the summer than it is during the winter;\r\nneither is the shearing-force of the great mass of the ice of a glacier\r\nsensibly less during day than night, or during summer than winter;\r\nfor the temperature of the great mass of the ice does not sensibly\r\nvary with the seasons. If this be the case, then gravitation ought to\r\nbe as able to shear the ice during the night as during the day, or\r\nduring the winter as during the summer. At any rate, if there should\r\nbe any difference it ought to be but trifling. It is true that, owing\r\nto the melting of the ice, the crevices of the glacier are more gorged\r\nwith water during summer than winter; and this, as Professor Forbes\r\nmaintains,[297] may tend to make the glacier move faster during the\r\nformer than the latter season. But the advocates of the regelation\r\ntheory cannot conclude, with Professor Forbes, that the water favours\r\nthe motion of the glacier by making the ice more soft and plastic. The\r\nmelting of the ice, according to the regelation theory, cannot very\r\nmaterially aid the motion of the glacier.\r\n\r\nThe theory which has led to the general belief that the ice of a\r\nglacier is sheared by the force of gravity appears to be the following.\r\nIt is supposed that the only forces to which the motion of a glacier\r\ncan be referred are _gravitation_ and _heat_; but as the great mass\r\nof a glacier remains constantly at the same uniform temperature it\r\nis concluded to be impossible that the motion of the glacier can be\r\ndue to this cause, and therefore of course it must be attributed to\r\ngravitation, there being no other cause.\r\n\r\nThat gravitation is insufficient to shear the ice of a glacier has been\r\nclearly demonstrated by Canon Moseley.[298] He determined by experiment\r\nthe amount of force required to shear one square inch of ice, and found\r\nit to be about 75 lbs. By a process of calculation which will be found\r\ndetailed in the Memoir referred to, he demonstrated that to descend\r\nby its own weight at the rate at which Professor Tyndall observed the\r\nice of the Mer de Glace to be descending at the Tacul, the unit of\r\nshearing force of the ice could not have been more than 1·31931 lbs.\r\nConsequently it will require a force more than 34 times the weight of\r\nthe glacier to shear the ice and cause it to descend in the manner in\r\nwhich it is found to descend.\r\n\r\nIt is now six years since Canon Moseley’s results were laid before the\r\npublic, and no one, as far as I am aware, has yet attempted to point\r\nout any serious defect in his mathematical treatment of the question.\r\nSeeing the great amount of interest manifested in the question of\r\nglacier-motion, I think we are warranted to conclude that had the\r\nmathematical part of the memoir been inconclusive its defects would\r\nhave been pointed out ere this time. The question, then, hinges on\r\nwhether the experimental data on which his calculations are based\r\nbe correct. Or, in other words, is the unit of shear of ice as much\r\nas 75 lbs.? This part of Mr. Moseley’s researches has not passed\r\nunquestioned. Mr. Ball and Mr. Mathews, both of whom have had much\r\nexperience among glaciers, and have bestowed considerable attention on\r\nthe subject of glacier-motion, have objected to the accuracy of Mr.\r\nMoseley’s unit of shear. I have carefully read the interesting memoirs\r\nof Mr. Mathews and Mr. Ball in reply to Canon Moseley, but I am unable\r\nto perceive that anything which they have advanced materially affects\r\nhis general conclusions as regards the commonly received theory. Mr.\r\nMathews objects to Canon Moseley’s experiments on the grounds that\r\nextraneous forces are brought to bear upon the substance submitted\r\nto operation, and that conditions are thus introduced which do not\r\nobtain in the case of an actual glacier. “It would throw,” he says,\r\n“great light upon our inquiry if we were to change this method of\r\nprocedure and simply to observe the deportment of masses of ice under\r\nthe influence of no external forces but the gravitation of their own\r\nparticles.”[299] A plank of ice six inches wide and 2⅜ inches in\r\nthickness was supported at each end by bearers six feet apart. From the\r\nmoment the plank was placed in position it began to sink, and continued\r\nto do so until it touched the surface over which it was supported. Mr.\r\nMathews remarks that with this property of ice, viz., its power to\r\nchange its form under strains produced by its own gravitation, combined\r\nwith the sliding movement demonstrated by Hopkins, we have an adequate\r\ncause for glacier-motion. Mr. Mathews concludes from this experiment\r\nthat the unit of shear in ice, instead of being 75 lbs., is less than\r\n1¾ lbs.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, no parallel between the bending of the ice-plank and\r\nthe shearing of a glacier. Mr. Mathews’ experiment appears to prove too\r\nmuch, as will be seen from the following reply of Canon Moseley:—\r\n\r\n“Now I will,” he says, “suggest to Mr. Mathews a parallel experiment\r\nand a parallel explanation. If a bar of wrought iron 1 inch square and\r\n20 feet long were supported at its extremities, it would _bend_ by its\r\nweight alone, and would therefore shear. Now the weight of such a\r\nrod would be about 67 lbs. According to Mr. Mathews’s explanation in\r\nthe case of the ice-plank, the unit of shear in wrought-iron should\r\ntherefore be 67 lbs. per square inch. It is actually 50,000 lbs.”[300]\r\n\r\nWhatever theory we may adopt as to the cause of the motion of glaciers,\r\nthe deflection of the plank in the way described by Mr. Mathews\r\n_follows as a necessary consequence_. Although no weight was placed\r\nupon the plank, it does not necessarily follow that the deflection\r\nwas caused by the weight of the ice alone; for, according to Canon\r\nMoseley’s own theory of the motion of glaciers by heat, the plank\r\nought to be deflected in the middle, just as it was in Mr. Mathews’s\r\nexperiment. A solid body, when exposed to variations of temperature,\r\nwill expand and contract transversely as well as longitudinally. Ice,\r\naccording to Canon Moseley’s theory, expands and contracts by heat.\r\nThen if the plank expands transversely, the upper half of the plank\r\nmust rise and the lower half descend. But the side which rises has\r\nto perform work against gravity, whereas the side which descends has\r\nwork performed upon it by gravity; consequently more of the plank will\r\ndescend than rise, and this will, of course, tend to lower or deflect\r\nthe plank in the middle. Again, when the plank contracts, the lower\r\nhalf will rise and the upper half will descend; but as gravitation,\r\nin this case also, favours the descending part and opposes the rising\r\npart, more of the plank will descend than rise, and consequently\r\nthe plank will be lowered in the middle by contraction as well as\r\nby expansion. Thus, as the plank changes its temperature, it must,\r\naccording to Mr. Moseley’s theory, descend or be deflected in the\r\nmiddle, step by step—and this not by gravitation alone, but chiefly\r\nby the motive power of heat. I do not, of course, mean to assert that\r\nthe descent of the plank was caused by heat; but I assert that Mr.\r\nMathews’s experiment does not necessarily prove (and this is all that\r\nis required in the meantime) that gravitation alone was the cause of\r\nthe deflection of the plank. Neither does this experiment prove that\r\nthe ice was deflected without shearing; for although the weight of the\r\nplank was not sufficient to shear the ice, as Mr. Mathews, I presume,\r\nadmits, yet Mr. Moseley would reply that the weight of the ice,\r\nassisted by the motive power of heat, was perfectly sufficient.\r\n\r\nI shall now briefly refer to Mr. Ball’s principal objections to Canon\r\nMoseley’s proof that a glacier cannot shear by its weight alone. One\r\nof his chief objections is that Mr. Moseley has assumed the ice to be\r\nhomogeneous in structure, and that pressures and tensions acting within\r\nit, are not modified by the varying constitution of the mass.[301]\r\nAlthough there is, no doubt, some force in this objection (for we have\r\nprobably good reason to believe that ice will shear, for example, more\r\neasily along certain planes than others), still I can hardly think that\r\nCanon Moseley’s main conclusion can ever be materially affected by this\r\nobjection. The main question is this, Can the ice of the glacier shear\r\nby its own weight in the way generally supposed? Now the shearing force\r\nof ice, take it in whatever direction we may, so enormously exceeds\r\nthat required by Mr. Moseley in order to allow a glacier to descend by\r\nits weight only, that it is a matter of indifference whether ice be\r\nregarded as homogeneous in structure or not. Mr. Ball objects also to\r\nMr. Moseley’s imaginary glacier lying on an even slope and in a uniform\r\nrectangular channel. He thinks that an irregular channel and a variable\r\nslope would be more favourable to the descent of the ice. But surely\r\nif the work by the weight of the ice be not equal to the work by the\r\nresistance in a glacier of uniform breadth and slope, it must be much\r\nless so in the case of one of irregular shape and slope.\r\n\r\nThat a relative displacement of the particles of the ice is involved\r\nin the motion of a glacier, is admitted, of course, by Mr. Ball; but\r\nhe states that the amount of this displacement is but small, and that\r\nit is effected with extreme slowness. This may be the case; but if the\r\nweight of the ice be not able to overcome the mutual cohesion of the\r\nparticles, then the weight of the ice cannot produce the required\r\ndisplacement, however small it may be. Mr. Ball then objects to Mr.\r\nMoseley’s method of determining the unit of shear on this ground:—The\r\nshearing of the ice in a glacier is effected with extreme slowness;\r\nbut the shearing in Canon Moseley’s experiment was effected with\r\nrapidity; and although it required 75 lbs. to shear one square inch of\r\nsurface in his experiment, it does not follow that 75 lbs. would be\r\nrequired to shear the ice if done in the slow manner in which it is\r\neffected in the glacier. “In short,” says Mr. Ball, “to ascertain the\r\nresistance opposed to very slow changes in the relative positions of\r\nthe particles, so slight as to be insensible at short distances, Mr.\r\nMoseley measures the resistance opposed to rapid disruption between\r\ncontiguous portions of the same substance.”\r\n\r\nThere is force in this objection; and here we arrive at a really weak\r\npoint in Canon Moseley’s reasoning. His experiments show that if we\r\nwant to shear ice quickly a weight of nearly 120 lbs. is required; but\r\nif the thing is to be done more slowly, 75 lbs. will suffice.[302] In\r\nshort, the number of pounds required to shear the ice depends, to a\r\nlarge extent, on the length of time that the weight is allowed to act;\r\nthe longer it is allowed to act, the less will be the weight required\r\nto perform the work. “I am curious to know,” says Mr. Mathews, when\r\nreferring to this point, “what weight would have sheared the ice\r\nif a _day_ had been allowed for its operation.” I do not know what\r\nwould have been the weight required to shear the ice in Mr. Moseley’s\r\nexperiments had a day been allowed; but I feel pretty confident that,\r\nshould the ice remain unmelted, and sufficient time be allowed,\r\nshearing would be produced without the application of any weight\r\nwhatever. There are no weights placed upon a glacier to make it move,\r\nand yet the ice of the glacier shears. If the shearing is effected by\r\nweight, the only weight applied is the weight of the ice; and if the\r\nweight of the ice makes the ice shear in the glacier, why may it not\r\ndo the same thing in the experiment? Whatever may be the cause which\r\ndisplaces the particles of the ice in a glacier, they, as a matter of\r\nfact, are displaced without any weight being applied beyond that of\r\nthe ice itself; and if so, why may not the particles of the ice in\r\nthe experiment be also displaced without the application of weights?\r\nAllow the ice of the glacier to take its own time and its own way, and\r\nthe particles will move over each other without the aid of external\r\nweights, whatever may be the cause of this; well, then, allow the ice\r\nin the experiment to take its own time and its own way, and it will\r\nprobably do the same thing. There is something here unsatisfactory.\r\nIf, by the unit of shear, be meant the pressure in pounds that must\r\nbe applied to the ice to break the connection of one square inch of\r\ntwo surfaces frozen together and cause the one to slip over the other,\r\nthen the amount of pressure required to do this will depend upon the\r\ntime you allow for the thing being done. If the thing is to be done\r\nrapidly, as in some of Mr. Moseley’s experiments, it will take, as he\r\nhas shown, a pressure of about 120 lbs.; but if the thing has to be\r\ndone more slowly, as in some other of his experiments, 75 lbs. will\r\nsuffice. And if sufficient time be allowed, as in the case of glaciers,\r\nthe thing may be done without any weight whatever being applied to the\r\nice, and, of course, Mr. Moseley’s argument, that a glacier cannot\r\ndescend by its weight alone, falls to the ground. But if, by the unit\r\nof shear, be meant not the _weight_ or _pressure_ necessary to shear\r\nthe ice, but the amount of _work_ required to shear a square inch of\r\nsurface _in a given time or at a given rate_, then he might be able\r\nto show that in the case of a glacier (say the Mer de Glace) the work\r\nof all the resistances which are opposed to its descent at the _rate_\r\nat which it is descending is greater than the work of its weight, and\r\nthat consequently there must be some cause, in addition to the weight,\r\nurging the glacier forward. But then he would have no right to affirm\r\nthat the glacier would not descend by its weight only; all that he\r\ncould affirm would simply be that it could not descend by its weight\r\nalone at the _rate_ at which it is descending.\r\n\r\nMr. Moseley’s unit of shear, however, is not the amount of work\r\nperformed in shearing a square inch of ice in a given time, but the\r\namount of _weight_ or _pressure_ requiring to be applied to the ice\r\nto shear a square inch. But this amount of pressure depends upon the\r\nlength of time that the pressure is applied. Here lies the difficulty\r\nin determining what amount of pressure is to be taken as the real unit.\r\nAnd here also lies the radical defect in Canon Moseley’s result. Time\r\nas well as pressure enters as an element into the process. The key to\r\nthe explanation of this curious circumstance will, I think, be found in\r\nthe fact that the rate at which a glacier descends depends in some way\r\nor other upon the amount of heat that the ice is receiving. This fact\r\nshows that heat has something to do in the shearing of the ice of the\r\nglacier. But in the communication of heat to the ice _time_ necessarily\r\nenters as an element. There are two different ways in which heat may be\r\nconceived to aid in shearing the ice: (1.) we may conceive that heat\r\nacts as a force along with gravitation in producing displacement of the\r\nparticles of the ice; or (2.) we may conceive that heat does not act as\r\na force in pushing the particles over each other, but that it assists\r\nthe shearing processes by diminishing the cohesion of the particles of\r\nthe ice, and thus allowing gravitation to produce displacement. The\r\nformer is the function attributed to heat in Canon Moseley’s theory\r\nof glacier-motion; the latter is the function attributed to heat in\r\nthe theory of glacier-motion which I ventured to advance some time\r\nago.[303] It results, therefore, from Canon Moseley’s own theory, that\r\nthe longer the time that is allowed for the pressure to shear the\r\nice, the less will be the pressure required; for, according to his\r\ntheory, a very large proportion of the displacement is produced by the\r\nmotive power of heat entering the ice; and, as it follows of course,\r\nother things being equal, the longer the time during which the heat\r\nis allowed to act, the greater will be the proportionate amount of\r\ndisplacement produced by the heat; consequently the less will require\r\nto be done by the weight applied. In the case of the glacier, Mr.\r\nMoseley concludes that at least thirty or forty times as much work is\r\ndone by the motive power of heat in the way of shearing the ice as is\r\ndone by mere pressure or weight. Then, if sufficient time be allowed,\r\nwhy may not far more be done by heat in shearing the ice in his\r\nexperiment than by the weight applied? In this case how is he to know\r\nhow much of the shearing is effected by the heat and how much by the\r\nweight? If the greater part of the shearing of the ice in the case of a\r\nglacier is produced, not by pressure, but by the heat which necessarily\r\nenters the ice, it would be inconceivable that in his experiments the\r\nheat entering the ice should not produce, at least to some extent, a\r\nsimilar effect. And if a portion of the displacement of the particles\r\nis produced by heat, then the weight which is applied cannot be\r\nregarded as the measure of the force employed in the displacement, any\r\nmore than it could be inferred that the weight of the glacier is the\r\nmeasure of the force employed in the shearing of it. If the weight\r\nis not the entire force employed in shearing, but only a part of the\r\nforce, then the weight cannot, as in Mr. Moseley’s experiment, be taken\r\nas the measure of the force.\r\n\r\nHow, then, are we to determine what is the amount of force required to\r\nshear ice? in other words, how is the unit of shear to be determined?\r\nIf we are to measure the unit of shear by the weight required to\r\nproduce displacement of the particles of the ice, we must make sure\r\nthat the displacement is wholly effected by the weight. We must be\r\ncertain that heat does not enter as an element in the process. But\r\nif time be allowed to elapse during the experiment, we can never\r\nbe certain that heat has not been at work. It is impossible to\r\nprevent heat entering the ice. We may keep the ice at a constant\r\ntemperature, but this would not prevent heat from entering the ice and\r\nproducing molecular work. True that, according to Moseley’s theory\r\nof glacier-motion, if the temperature of the ice be not permitted\r\nto _vary_, then no displacement of the particles can take place\r\nfrom the influence of heat; but according to the molecular theory of\r\nglacier-motion, which will shortly be considered, heat will aid the\r\ndisplacement of the particles whether the temperature be kept constant\r\nor not. In short, it is absolutely impossible in our experiments to\r\nbe certain that heat is not in some way or other concerned in the\r\ndisplacement of the particles of the ice. But we can shorten the time,\r\nand thus make sure that the amount of heat entering the ice during the\r\nexperiments is too small to affect materially the result. We cannot in\r\nthis case say that all the displacement has been effected by the weight\r\napplied to the ice, but we can say that so little has been done by heat\r\nthat, practically, we may regard it as all done by the weight.\r\n\r\nThis consideration, I trust, shows that the unit of shear adopted by\r\nCanon Moseley in his calculations is not too large. For if in half an\r\nhour, after all the work that may have been done by heat, a pressure of\r\n75 lbs. is still required to displace the particles of one square inch,\r\nit is perfectly evident that if no work had been done by heat during\r\nthat time, the force required to produce the displacement could not\r\nhave been less than 75 lbs. It might have been more than that; but it\r\ncould not have been less. Be this, however, as it may, in determining\r\nthe unit of shear we cannot be permitted to prolong the experiment for\r\nany considerable length of time, because the weight under which the\r\nice might then shear could not be taken as the measure of the force\r\nwhich is required to shear ice. By prolonging the experiment we might\r\npossibly get a unit smaller than that required by Canon Moseley for\r\na glacier to descend by its own weight. But it would be just as much\r\nbegging the whole question at issue to assume that, because the ice\r\nsheared under such a weight, a glacier might descend by its weight\r\nalone, as it would be to assume that, because a glacier shears without\r\na weight being placed upon it, the glacier descends by its weight alone.\r\n\r\nBut why not determine the unit of shear of ice in the same way as we\r\nwould the unit of shear of any other solid substance, such, as iron,\r\nstone, or wood? If the shearing force of ice be determined in this\r\nmanner, it will be found to be by far too great to allow of the ice\r\nshearing by its weight alone. We shall be obliged to admit either\r\nthat the ice of the glacier does not shear (in the ordinary sense of\r\nthe term), or if it does shear, that there must, as Canon Moseley\r\nconcludes, be some other force in addition to the weight of the ice\r\nurging the glacier forward.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the rate of descent of a glacier depends upon the amount\r\nof heat which it receives, proves that heat must be regarded either as\r\na cause or as a necessary condition of its motion; what, then, is the\r\nnecessary relationship between heat and the motion of the glacier? If\r\nheat is to be regarded as a cause, in what way does the heat produce\r\nmotion? I shall now briefly refer to one or two theories which have\r\nbeen advanced on the subject. Let us consider first that of Canon\r\nMoseley.\r\n\r\n_Canon Moseley’s Theory._—He found, from observations and experiments,\r\nthat sheets of lead, placed upon an inclined plane, when subjected to\r\nvariations of temperature, tend to descend even when the slope is far\r\nless than that which would enable it to slide down under the influence\r\nof gravitation. The cause of the descent he shows to be this. When the\r\ntemperature of the sheet is raised, it expands, and, in expanding, its\r\nupper portion moves up the slope, and its lower portion down the slope;\r\nbut as gravitation opposes the upward and favours the downward motion,\r\nmore of the sheet moves down than up, and consequently the centre\r\nof gravity of the sheet is slightly lowered. Again, when the sheet\r\nis cooled, it contracts, and in contracting the upper portion moves\r\ndownwards and the lower portion upwards, and here again, for the same\r\nreason, more of the sheet moves downwards than upwards. Consequently,\r\nat every change of temperature there is a slight displacement of the\r\nsheet downwards. “Now a theory of the descent of glaciers,” says\r\nCanon Moseley, “which I have ventured to propose myself, is that they\r\ndescend, as the lead in this experiment does, by reason of the passage\r\ninto them and the withdrawal of the sun’s rays, and that the dilatation\r\nand contraction of the ice so produced is the proximate cause of their\r\ndescent, as it is of that of the lead.”[304]\r\n\r\nThe fundamental condition in Mr. Moseley’s theory of the descent of\r\nsolid bodies on an incline, is, not that heat should maintain these\r\nbodies at a high temperature, but that the temperature should vary.\r\nThe rate of descent is proportionate, not simply to the amount of\r\nheat received, but to the extent and frequency of the variations of\r\ntemperature. As a proof that glaciers are subjected to great variations\r\nof temperature, he adduces the following:—“All alpine travellers,” he\r\nsays, “from De Saussure to Forbes and Tyndall, have borne testimony\r\nto the intensity of the solar radiation on the surfaces of glaciers.\r\n‘I scarcely ever,’ says Forbes, ‘remember to have found the sun more\r\npiercing than at the Jardin.’ This heat passes abruptly into a state\r\nof intense cold when any part of the glacier falls into shadow by an\r\nalteration of the position of the sun, or even by the passing over it\r\nof a cloud.”[305]\r\n\r\nMr. Moseley is here narrating simply what the traveller feels, and\r\nnot what the glacier experiences. The traveller is subjected to great\r\nvariations of temperature; but there is no proof from this that the\r\nglacier experiences any changes of temperature. It is rather because\r\nthe temperature of the glacier is not affected by the sun’s heat that\r\nthe traveller is so much chilled when the sun’s rays are cut off. The\r\nsun shines down with piercing rays and the traveller is scorched; the\r\nglacier melts on the surface, but it still remains “cold as ice.” The\r\nsun passes behind a cloud or disappears behind a neighbouring hill; the\r\nscorching rays are then withdrawn, and the traveller is now subjected\r\nto radiation on every side from surfaces at the freezing-point.\r\n\r\nIt is also a necessary condition in Mr. Moseley’s theory that the heat\r\nshould pass easily into and out of the glacier; for unless this were\r\nthe case sudden changes of temperature could produce little or no\r\neffect on the great mass of the glacier. How, then, is it possible that\r\nduring the heat of summer the temperature of the glacier could vary\r\nmuch? During that season, in the lower valleys at least, everything,\r\nwith the exception of the glacier, is above the freezing-point;\r\nconsequently when the glacier goes into the shade there is nothing\r\nto lower the ice below the freezing-point; and as the sun’s rays do\r\nnot raise the temperature of the ice above the freezing-point, the\r\ntemperature of the glacier must therefore remain unaltered during that\r\nseason. It therefore follows that, instead of a glacier moving more\r\nrapidly during the middle of summer than during the middle of winter,\r\nit should, according to Moseley’s theory, have no motion whatever\r\nduring summer.\r\n\r\nThe following, written fifteen years ago by Professor Forbes on this\r\nvery point, is most conclusive:—“But how stands the fact? Mr. Moseley\r\nquotes from De Saussure the following _daily ranges_ of the temperature\r\nof the air in the month of July at the Col du Géant and at Chamouni,\r\nbetween which points the glacier lies:\r\n\r\n                           °\r\n  At the Col du Géant      4·257 Réaumur.\r\n  At Chamouni             10·092    〃\r\n\r\nAnd he assumes ‘the same mean daily variation of temperature to obtain\r\nthroughout the length’ [and depth?] ‘of the Glacier du Géant which De\r\nSaussure observed in July at the Col du Géant.’ But between what limits\r\ndoes the temperature of the air oscillate? We find, by referring to\r\nthe third volume of De Saussure’s ‘Travels,’ that the mean temperature\r\nof the coldest hour (4 A.M.) during his stay at the Col du Géant was\r\n33°·03 Fahrenheit, and of the warmest (2 P.M.) 42°·61 F. So that even\r\nupon that exposed ridge, between 2,000 and 3,000 feet above where the\r\nglacier can be properly said to commence, the air does not, on an\r\naverage of the month of July, reach the freezing-point at any hour\r\nof the night. Consequently the _range of temperature attributed to\r\nthe glacier is between limits absolutely incapable of effecting the\r\nexpansion of the ice in the smallest degree_.”[306]\r\n\r\nAgain, during winter, as Mr. Ball remarks, the glacier is completely\r\ncovered with snow and thus protected both from the influence of\r\ncold and of heat, so that there can be nothing either to raise the\r\ntemperature of the ice above the freezing-point or to bring it below\r\nthat point; and consequently the glacier ought to remain immovable\r\nduring that season also.\r\n\r\n“There can be no doubt, therefore,” Mr. Moseley states, “that the\r\nrays of the sun, which in those alpine regions are of such remarkable\r\nintensity, find their way into the depths of the glacier. They are\r\na _power_, and there is no such thing as the loss of power. The\r\nmechanical work which is their equivalent, and into which they are\r\nconverted when received into the substance of a solid body, accumulates\r\nand stores itself up in the ice under the form of what we call\r\nelastic force or tendency to dilate, until it becomes sufficient to\r\nproduce actual dilatation of the ice in the direction in which the\r\nresistance is weakest, and by its withdrawal to produce contraction.\r\nFrom this expansion and contraction follows of necessity the descent\r\nof the glacier.”[307] When the temperature of the ice is below\r\nthe freezing-point, the rays which are absorbed will, no doubt,\r\nproduce dilatation; but during summer, when the ice is not below the\r\nfreezing-point, no dilatation can possibly take place. All physicists,\r\nso far as I am aware, agree that the rays that are then absorbed go to\r\nmelt the ice, and not to expand it. But to this Mr. Moseley replied\r\nas follows:—“To this there is the obvious answer that radiant heat\r\ndoes find its way into ice as a matter of common observation, and\r\nthat it does not melt it except at its surface. Blocks of ice may be\r\nseen in the windows of ice-shops with the sun shining full upon them,\r\nand melting nowhere but on their surfaces. And the experiment of the\r\nice-lens shows that heat may stream through ice in abundance (of which\r\na portion is necessarily stopped in the passage) without melting it,\r\nexcept on its surface.” But what evidence is there to conclude that\r\nif there is no melting of the ice in the interior of the lens there\r\nis a portion of the rays “necessarily stopped” in the interior? It\r\nwill not do to assume a point so much opposed to all that we know of\r\nthe physical properties of ice as this really is. It is absolutely\r\nessential to Mr. Moseley’s theory of the motion of glaciers, during\r\nsummer at least, that ice should continue to expand after it reaches\r\nthe melting-point; and it has therefore to be shown that such is the\r\ncase; or it need not be wondered at that we cannot accept his theory,\r\nbecause it demands the adoption of a conclusion contrary to all our\r\nprevious conceptions. But, as a matter of fact, it is not strictly true\r\nthat when rays pass through a piece of ice there is no melting of the\r\nice in the interior. Experiments made by Professor Tyndall show the\r\ncontrary.[308]\r\n\r\nThere is, however, one fortunate circumstance connected with Canon\r\nMoseley’s theory. It is this: its truth can be easily tested by direct\r\nexperiment. The ice, according to this theory, descends not simply\r\nin virtue of heat, but in virtue of _change of temperature_. Try,\r\nthen, Hopkins’s famous experiment, but keep the ice at a _constant\r\ntemperature_; then, according to Moseley’s theory, the ice will not\r\ndescend. Let it be observed, however, that although the ice under this\r\ncondition should descend (as there is little doubt but it would),\r\nit would show that Mr. Moseley’s theory of the descent of glaciers\r\nis incorrect, still it would not in the least degree affect the\r\nconclusions which he lately arrived at in regard to the generally\r\nreceived theory of glacier-motion. It would not prove that the ice\r\nsheared, in the way generally supposed, by its weight only. It might be\r\nthe heat, after all, entering the ice, which accounted for its descent,\r\nalthough gravitation (the weight of the ice) might be the impelling\r\ncause.\r\n\r\nAccording to this theory, the glacier, like the sheet of lead, must\r\nexpand and contract as one entire mass, and it is difficult to\r\nconceive how this could account for the differential motion of the\r\nparticles of the ice.\r\n\r\n_Professor James Thomson’s Theory._—It was discovered by this physicist\r\nthat the freezing-point of water is lowered by pressure. The extent\r\nof the lowering is equal to ·0075° centigrade for every atmosphere\r\nof pressure. As glacier ice is generally about the melting-point,\r\nit follows that when enormous pressure is brought to bear upon any\r\ngiven point of a glacier a melting of the ice at that particular spot\r\nwill take place in consequence of the lowering of the melting-point.\r\nThe melting of the ice will, of course, tend to favour the descent\r\nof the glacier, but I can hardly think the liquefaction produced by\r\npressure can account for the motion of glaciers. It will help to\r\nexplain the giving way of the ice at particular points subjected to\r\ngreat pressure, but I am unable to comprehend how it can account for\r\nthe general descent of the glacier. Conceive a rectangular glacier of\r\nuniform breadth and thickness, and lying upon an even slope. In such a\r\nglacier the pressure at each particular point would remain constant,\r\nfor there would be no reason why it should be greater at one time than\r\nat another. Suppose the glacier to be 500 feet in thickness; the ice\r\nat the lower surface of the glacier, owing to pressure, would have its\r\nmelting-point permanently lowered one-tenth of a degree centigrade\r\nbelow that of the upper surface; but the ice at the lower surface would\r\nnot, on this account, be in the fluid state. It would simply be ice at\r\na slightly lower temperature. True, when pressure is exerted the ice\r\nmelts in consequence of the lowering of the melting-point, but in the\r\ncase under consideration there would, properly speaking, be no exertion\r\nof pressure, but a constant statical pressure resulting from the weight\r\nof the ice. But this statical condition of pressure would not produce\r\nfluidity any more than a statical condition of pressure would produce\r\nheat, and consequently motion could not take place as a result of\r\nfluidity. In short, motion itself is required to produce the fluidity.\r\n\r\nI need not here wait to consider the sliding theories of De Saussure\r\nand Hopkins, as they are now almost universally admitted to be\r\ninadequate to explain the phenomena of glacier-motion, seeing that they\r\ndo not account for the displacement of the particles of the ice over\r\none another.\r\n\r\nAccording to the dilatation theory of M. Charpentier, a glacier is\r\nimpelled by the force exerted by water freezing in the fissures of the\r\nice. A glacier he considers is full of fissures into which water is\r\nbeing constantly infiltrated, and when the temperature of the air sinks\r\nbelow the freezing-point it converts the water into ice. The water, in\r\npassing into ice, expands, and in expanding tends to impel the glacier\r\nin the direction of least resistance. This theory, although it does not\r\nexplain glacier-motion, as has been clearly shown by Professor J. D.\r\nForbes, nevertheless contains one important element which, as we shall\r\nsee, must enter into the true explanation. The element to which I refer\r\nis the expansive force exerted on the glacier by water freezing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\n           THE PHYSICAL CAUSE OF THE MOTION OF GLACIERS.—THE\r\n                           MOLECULAR THEORY.\r\n\r\n  Present State of the Question.—Heat necessary to the Motion of\r\n      a Glacier.—Ice does not shear in the Solid State.—Motion\r\n      of a Glacier _molecular_.—How Heat is transmitted through\r\n      Ice.—Momentary Loss of Shearing Force.—The _Rationale_\r\n      of Regelation.—The Origin of “Crevasses.”—Effects of\r\n      Tension.—Modification of Theory.—Fluid Molecules crystallize\r\n      in Interstices.—Expansive Force of crystallizing Molecules\r\n      a Cause of Motion.—Internal molecular Pressure the chief\r\n      Moving Power.—How Ice can excavate a Rock Basin.—How Ice can\r\n      ascend a Slope.—How deep River Valleys are striated across.—A\r\n      remarkable Example in the Valley of the Tay.—How Boulders can\r\n      be carried from a lower to a higher Level.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe condition which the perplexing question of the cause of the descent\r\nof glaciers has now reached seems to be something like the following.\r\nThe ice of a glacier is not in a soft and plastic state, but is solid,\r\nhard, brittle, and unyielding. It nevertheless behaves in some respects\r\nin a manner very like what a soft and plastic substance would do if\r\nplaced in similar circumstances, inasmuch as it accommodates itself\r\nto all the inequalities of the channel in which it moves. The ice of\r\nthe glacier, though hard and solid, moves with a differential motion;\r\nthe particles of the ice are displaced over each other, or, in other\r\nwords, the ice shears as it descends. It had been concluded that the\r\nmere weight of the glacier is sufficient to shear the ice. Canon\r\nMoseley has investigated this point, and shown that it is not. He has\r\nfound that for a glacier to shear in the way that it is supposed to\r\ndo, it would require a force some thirty or forty times as great as\r\nthe weight of the glacier. Consequently, for the glacier to descend,\r\na force in addition to that of gravitation is required. What, then,\r\nis this force? It is found that the rate at which the glacier descends\r\ndepends upon the amount of heat which it is receiving. This shows that\r\nthe motion of the glacier is in some way or other dependent upon heat.\r\nIs heat, then, the force we are in search of? The answer to this, of\r\ncourse, is, since heat is a force necessarily required, we have no\r\nright to assume any other till we see whether or not heat will suffice.\r\nIn what way, then, does heat aid gravitation in the descent of the\r\nglacier? In what way does heat assist gravitation in the shearing of\r\nthe ice? There are two ways whereby we may conceive the thing to be\r\ndone: the heat may assist gravitation to shear, by pressing the ice\r\nforward, or it may assist gravitation by diminishing the cohesion of\r\nthe particles, and thus allow gravitation to produce motion which it\r\notherwise could not produce. Every attempt which has yet been made\r\nto explain how heat can act as a force in pushing the ice forward,\r\nhas failed. The fact that heat cannot expand the ice of the glacier\r\nmay be regarded as a sufficient proof that it does not act as a force\r\nimpelling the glacier forward; and we are thus obliged to turn our\r\nattention to the other conception, viz., that heat assists gravitation\r\nto shear the ice, not by direct pressure, but by diminishing the\r\ncohesive force of the particles, so as to enable gravitation to push\r\nthe one past the other. But how is this done? Does heat diminish the\r\ncohesion by acting as an expansive force in separating the particles?\r\nHeat cannot do this, because it cannot expand the ice of a glacier;\r\nand besides, were it to do this, it would destroy the solid and firm\r\ncharacter of the ice, and the ice of the glacier would not then, as\r\na mass, possess the great amount of shearing-force which observation\r\nand experiment show that it does. In short it is because the particles\r\nare so firmly fixed together at the time the glacier is descending,\r\nthat we are obliged to call in the aid of some other force in addition\r\nto the weight of the glacier to shear the ice. Heat does not cause\r\ndisplacement of the particles by making the ice soft and plastic; for\r\nwe know that the ice of the glacier is not soft and plastic, but\r\nhard and brittle. The shearing-force of the ice of the moving glacier\r\nis found to be by at least from thirty to forty times too great to\r\npermit of the ice being sheared by the mere force of gravitation;\r\nhow, then, is it that gravitation, without the direct assistance of\r\nany other force, can manage to shear the ice? Or to put the question\r\nunder another form: heat does not reduce the shearing-force of the ice\r\nof a glacier to something like 1·3193 lb. per square inch of surface,\r\nthe unit required by Mr. Moseley to enable a glacier to shear by\r\nits weight; the shearing-force of the ice, notwithstanding all the\r\nheat received, still remains at about 75 lbs.; how, then, can the\r\nglacier shear without any other force than its own weight pushing it\r\nforward? _This is the fundamental question; and the true answer to it\r\nmust reveal the mystery of glacier-motion._ We are compelled in the\r\npresent state of the problem to admit that glaciers do descend with\r\na differential motion without any other force than their own weight\r\npushing them forward; and yet the shearing-force of the ice is actually\r\nfound to be thirty or forty times the maximum that would permit of the\r\nglacier shearing by its weight only. _The explanation of this apparent\r\nparadox will remove all our difficulties in reference to the cause of\r\nthe descent of glaciers._\r\n\r\nThere seems to be but one explanation (and it is a very obvious\r\none), viz. that the motion of the glacier is _molecular_. The ice\r\ndescends molecule by molecule. The ice of a glacier is in the hard\r\ncrystalline state, but it does not descend in this state. Gravitation\r\nis a constantly acting force; if a particle of the ice lose its\r\nshearing-force, though but for the moment, it will descend by its\r\nweight alone. But a particle of the ice will lose its shearing-force\r\nfor a moment if the particle loses its crystalline state for the\r\nmoment. The passage of heat through ice, whether by conduction or by\r\nradiation, in all probability is a molecular process; that is, the\r\nform of energy termed heat is transmitted from molecule to molecule\r\nof the ice. A particle takes the energy from its neighbour A on the\r\none side and hands it over to its neighbour B on the opposite side.\r\nBut the particle must be in a different state at the moment it is in\r\npossession of the energy from what it was before it received it from\r\nA, and from what it will be after it has handed it over to B. Before\r\nit became possessed of the energy, it was in the crystalline state—it\r\nwas ice; and after it loses possession of the energy it will be ice;\r\nbut at the moment that it is in possession of the passing energy is\r\nit in the crystalline or icy state? If we assume that it is not, but\r\nthat in becoming possessed of the energy, it loses its crystalline form\r\nand for the moment becomes water, all our difficulties regarding the\r\ncause of the motion of glaciers are removed. We know that the ice of a\r\nglacier in the mass cannot become possessed of energy in the form of\r\nheat without becoming fluid; _if it can be shown that the same thing\r\nholds true of the ice particle, we have the key to the mystery of\r\nglacier-motion_. A moment’s reflection will suffice to convince any one\r\nthat if the glacier ice in the mass cannot receive energy in the form\r\nof heat without melting, the same must hold true of the ice particles,\r\nfor it is inconceivable that the ice in the mass could melt and yet\r\nthe ice particles themselves remain in the solid state. It is the\r\nsolidity of the particles which constitutes the solidity of the mass.\r\nIf the particles lose their solid form the mass loses its solid form,\r\nfor the mass has no other solidity than that which is possessed by the\r\nparticles.\r\n\r\nThe correctness of the conclusion, that the weight of the ice is\r\nnot a sufficient cause, depends upon the truth of a certain element\r\ntaken for granted in the reasoning, viz. that the _shearing-force_ of\r\nthe molecules of the ice remains _constant_. If this force remains\r\nconstant, then Canon Moseley’s conclusion is undoubtedly correct,\r\nbut not otherwise; for if a molecule should lose its shearing-force,\r\nthough it were but for a moment, if no obstacle stood in front of the\r\nmolecule, it would descend in virtue of its weight.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the shearing-force of a mass of ice is found to be\r\nconstant does not prove that the same is the case in regard to the\r\nindividual molecules. If we take a mass of molecules in the aggregate,\r\nthe shearing-force of the mass taken thus collectively may remain\r\nabsolutely constant, while at the same time each individual molecule\r\nmay be suffering repeated momentary losses of shearing-force. This is\r\nso obvious as to require no further elucidation. The whole matter,\r\ntherefore, resolves itself into this one question, as to whether or not\r\nthe shearing-force of a crystalline molecule of ice remains constant.\r\nIn the case of ordinary solid bodies we have no reason to conclude that\r\nthe shearing-force of the molecules ever disappears, but in regard to\r\nice it is very different.\r\n\r\nIf we analyze the process by which heat is conducted through ice, we\r\nshall find that we have reason to believe _that while a molecule of\r\nice is in the act of transmitting the energy received (say from a\r\nfire), it loses for the moment its shearing-force if the temperature of\r\nthe ice be not under_ 32° F. If we apply heat to the end of a bar of\r\niron, the molecules at the surface of the end have their temperatures\r\nraised. Molecule A at the surface, whose temperature has been raised,\r\ninstantly commences to transfer to B a portion of the energy received.\r\nThe tendency of this process is to lower the temperature of A and raise\r\nthat of B. B then, with its temperature raised, begins to transfer\r\nthe energy to C. The result here is the same; B tends to fall in\r\ntemperature, and C to rise. This process goes on from molecule to\r\nmolecule until the opposite end of the bar is reached. Here in this\r\ncase the energy or heat applied to the end of the bar is transmitted\r\nfrom molecule to molecule under the form of _heat or temperature_.\r\nThe energy applied to the bar does _not change its character; it\r\npasses right along from molecule to molecule under the form of heat or\r\ntemperature_. But the nature of the process must be wholly different if\r\nthe transferrence takes place through a bar of ice at the temperature\r\nof 32°. Suppose we apply the heat of the fire to the end of the bar\r\nof ice at 32°, the molecules of the ice cannot possibly have their\r\ntemperatures raised in the least degree. How, then, can molecule A\r\ntake on, _under the form of heat_, the energy received from the fire\r\nwithout being heated or having its _temperature_ raised? The thing is\r\nimpossible. The energy of the fire must appear in A under a different\r\nform from that of heat. The same process of reasoning is equally\r\napplicable to B. The molecule B cannot accept of the energy from A\r\nunder the form of heat; it must receive it under some other form. The\r\nsame must hold equally true of all the other molecules till we reach\r\nthe opposite end of the bar of ice. And yet, strange to say, the last\r\nmolecule transmits in the form of heat its energy to the objects\r\nbeyond; for we find that the heat applied to one side of a piece of ice\r\nwill affect the thermal pile on the opposite side.\r\n\r\nThe question is susceptible of a clear and definite answer. When\r\nheat is applied to a molecule of ice at 32°, the heat applied\r\ndoes not raise the temperature of the molecule, it is consumed in\r\nwork against the cohesive forces binding the atoms or particles\r\ntogether into the crystalline form. The energy then must exist in\r\nthe dissolved crystalline molecule, under the statical form of an\r\naffinity—crystalline affinity, or whatever else we may call it. That is\r\nto say, the energy then exists in the particles as a power or tendency\r\nto rush together again into the crystalline form, and the moment they\r\nare allowed to do so they give out the energy that was expended upon\r\nthem in their separation. This energy, when it is thus given out again,\r\nassumes the dynamical form of heat; in other words, the molecule gives\r\nout _heat_ in the act of freezing. The heat thus given out may be\r\nemployed to melt the next adjoining molecule. The ice-molecules take\r\non energy from a heated body by melting. That peculiar form of motion\r\nor energy called heat disappears in forcing the particles of the\r\ncrystalline molecule separate, and for the time being exists in the\r\nform of a tendency in the separated particles to come together again\r\ninto the crystalline form.\r\n\r\nBut it must be observed that although the crystalline molecule, when\r\nit is acting as a conductor, takes on energy under this form from the\r\nheated body, it only exists in the molecule under such a form during\r\nthe moment of transmission; that is to say, the molecule is melted, but\r\nonly for the moment. When B accepts of the energy from A, the molecule\r\nA instantly assumes the crystalline form. B is now melted; and when C\r\naccepts of the energy from B, then B also in turn assumes the solid\r\nstate. This process goes on from molecule to molecule till the energy\r\nis transmitted through to the opposite side and the ice is left in its\r\noriginal solid state. This, as will be shown in the Appendix, is the\r\n_rationale_ of Faraday’s property of regelation.\r\n\r\nThis is no mere theory or hypothesis; it is a necessary consequence\r\nfrom known facts. We know that ice at 32° cannot take on energy from\r\na heated body without melting; and we know also equally well that a\r\nslab of ice at 32°, notwithstanding this, still, as a mass, retains its\r\nsolid state while the heat is being transmitted through it. This proves\r\nthat every molecule resumes its crystalline form the moment after the\r\nenergy is transferred to the adjoining molecule.\r\n\r\nThis point being established, every difficulty regarding the descent\r\nof the glacier entirely disappears; for a molecule the moment that\r\nit assumes the fluid state is completely freed from shearing-force,\r\nand can descend by virtue of its own weight without any impediment.\r\nAll that the molecule requires is simply room or space to advance in.\r\nIf the molecule were in absolute contact with the adjoining molecule\r\nbelow, it would not descend unless it could push that molecule before\r\nit, which it probably would not be able to do. But the molecule\r\nactually has room in which to advance; for in passing from the solid\r\nto the liquid state its volume is diminished by about 1/10, and it\r\nconsequently can descend. True, when it again assumes the solid form\r\nit will regain its former volume; but the question is, will it go back\r\nto its old position? If we examine the matter thoroughly we shall find\r\nthat it cannot. If there were only this one molecule affected by the\r\nheat, this molecule would certainly not descend; but all the molecules\r\nare similarly affected, although not all at the same moment of time.\r\n\r\nLet us observe what takes place, say, at the lower end of the glacier.\r\nThe molecule A at the lower end, say, of the surface, receives heat\r\nfrom the sun’s rays; it melts, and in melting not only loses its\r\nshearing-force and descends by its own weight, but it contracts also.\r\nB immediately above it is now, so far as A is concerned, at liberty to\r\ndescend, and will do so the moment that it assumes the liquid state. A\r\nby this time has become solid, and again fixed by shearing-force; but\r\nit is not fixed in its old position, but a little below where it was\r\nbefore. If B has not already passed into the fluid state in consequence\r\nof heat derived from the sun, the additional supply which it will\r\nreceive from the solidifying of A will melt it. The moment that B\r\nbecomes fluid it will descend till it reaches A. B then is solidified\r\na little below its former position. The same process of reasoning is\r\nin a similar manner applicable to every molecule of the glacier. Each\r\nmolecule of the glacier consequently descends step by step as it melts\r\nand solidifies, and hence the glacier, considered as a mass, is in a\r\nstate of constant motion downwards. The fact observed by Professor\r\nTyndall that there are certain planes in the ice along which melting\r\ntakes place more readily than others will perhaps favour the descent of\r\nthe glacier.\r\n\r\nWe have in this theory a satisfactory explanation of the origin of\r\n“crevasses” in glaciers. Take, for example, the transverse crevasses\r\nformed at the point where an increase in the inclination of the glacier\r\ntakes place. Suppose a change of inclination from, say, 4° to 8° in\r\nthe bed of the glacier. The molecules on the slope of 8° will descend\r\nmore rapidly than those above on the slope of 4°. A state of tension\r\nwill therefore be induced at the point where the change of inclination\r\noccurs. The ice on the slope of 8° will tend to pull after it the mass\r\nof the glacier moving more slowly on the slope above. The pull being\r\ncontinued, the glacier will snap asunder the moment that the cohesion\r\nof the ice is overcome. The greater the change of inclination is, the\r\nmore readily will the rupture of the ice take place. Every species of\r\ncrevasse can be explained upon the same principle.[309]\r\n\r\nThis theory explains also why a glacier moves at a greater rate during\r\nsummer than during winter; for as the supply of heat to the glacier is\r\ngreater during the former season than during the latter, the molecules\r\nwill pass oftener into the liquid state.\r\n\r\nAs regards the denuding power of glaciers, I may observe that, though\r\na glacier descends molecule by molecule, it will grind the rocky bed\r\nover which it moves as effectually as it would do did it slide down in\r\na rigid mass in the way generally supposed; for the grinding-effect\r\nis produced not by the ice of the glacier, but by the stones, sand,\r\nand other materials forced along under it. But if all the resistances\r\nopposing the descent of a glacier, internal and external, are overcome\r\nby the mere weight of the ice alone, it can be proved that in the case\r\nof one descending with a given velocity the amount of work performed\r\nin forcing the grinding materials lying under the ice forward must be\r\nas great, supposing the motion of the ice to be molecular in the way\r\nI have explained, as it would be supposing the ice descended in the\r\nmanner generally supposed.\r\n\r\nOf course, a glacier could not descend by means of its weight as\r\nrapidly in the latter case as in the former; for, in fact, as Canon\r\nMoseley has shown, it would not in the latter case descend at all; but\r\nassuming for the sake of argument the rate of descent in both cases to\r\nbe the same, the conclusion I have stated would follow. Consequently\r\nwhatever denuding effects may have been attributed to the glacier,\r\naccording to the ordinary theory, must be equally attributable to it\r\naccording to the present explanation.\r\n\r\nThis theory, however, explains, what has always hitherto excited\r\nastonishment, viz., why a glacier can descend a slope almost\r\nhorizontal, or why the ice can move off the face of a continent\r\nperfectly level.\r\n\r\nThis is the form in which my explanation was first stated about\r\nhalf-a-dozen years ago.[310] There is, however another element\r\nwhich must be taken into account. It is one which will help to cast\r\nadditional light on some obscure points connected with glacial\r\nphenomena.\r\n\r\nIce is evidently not absolutely solid throughout. It is composed of\r\ncrystalline particles, which, though in contact with one another, are,\r\nhowever, not packed together so as to occupy the least possible space,\r\nand, even though they were, the particles would not fit so closely\r\ntogether as to exclude interstices. The crystalline particles are,\r\nhowever, united to one another at special points determined by their\r\npolarity, and on this account they require more space; and this in\r\nall probability is the reason, as Professor Tyndall remarks, why ice,\r\nvolume for volume, is less dense than water.\r\n\r\n“They (the molecules) like the magnets,” says Professor Tyndall, “are\r\nacted upon by two distinct forces; for a time, while the liquid is\r\nbeing cooled, they approach each other, in obedience to their general\r\nattraction for each other. But at a certain point new forces, some\r\nattractive some repulsive, _emanating from special points_ of the\r\nmolecules, come into play. The attracted points close up, the repelled\r\npoints retreat. Thus the molecules turn and rearrange themselves,\r\ndemanding as they do so more space, and overcoming all ordinary\r\nresistance by the energy of their demand. This, in general terms, is an\r\nexplanation of the expansion of water in solidifying.”[311]\r\n\r\nIt will be obvious, then, that when a crystalline molecule melts, it\r\nwill not merely descend in the manner already described, but capillary\r\nattraction will cause it to flow into the interstices between the\r\nadjoining molecules. The moment that it parts with the heat received,\r\nit will of course resolidify, as has been shown, but it will not\r\nsolidify so as to fit the cavity which it occupied when in the fluid\r\nstate. For the liquid molecule in solidifying assumes the crystalline\r\nform, and of course there will be a definite proportion between the\r\nlength, breadth, and thickness of the crystal; consequently it will\r\nalways happen that the interstice in which it solidifies will be too\r\nnarrow to contain it. The result will be that the fluid molecule\r\nin passing into the crystalline form will press the two adjoining\r\nmolecules aside in order to make sufficient room for itself between\r\nthem, and this it will do, no matter what amount of space it may\r\npossess in all other directions. The crystal will not form to suit the\r\ncavity, the cavity must be made to contain the crystal. And what holds\r\ntrue of one molecule, holds true of every molecule which melts and\r\nresolidifies. This process is therefore going on incessantly in every\r\npart of the glacier, and in proportion to the amount of heat which the\r\nglacier is receiving. This internal molecular pressure, resulting from\r\nthe solidifying of the fluid molecules in the interstices of the ice,\r\nacts on the mass of the ice as an expansive force, tending to cause the\r\nglacier to widen out laterally in all directions.\r\n\r\nConceive a mass of ice lying on a flat horizontal surface, and\r\nreceiving heat on its upper surface, say from the sun; as the heat\r\npasses downwards through the mass, the molecules, acting as conductors,\r\nmelt and resolidify. Each fluid molecule solidifies in an interstice,\r\nwhich has to be widened in order to contain it. The pressure thus\r\nexerted by the continual resolidifying of the molecules will cause the\r\nmass to widen out laterally, and of course as the mass widens out it\r\nwill grow thinner and thinner if it does not receive fresh acquisition\r\non its surface. In the case of a glacier lying in a valley, motion,\r\nhowever, will only take place in one direction. The sides of the\r\nvalley prevent the glacier from widening; and as gravitation opposes\r\nthe motion of the ice up, and favours its motion down the valley, the\r\npath of least resistance to molecular pressure will always be down\r\nthe slope, and consequently in this direction molecular displacement\r\nwill take place. Molecular pressure will therefore produce motion in\r\nthe same direction as that of gravity. In other words, it will tend to\r\ncause the glacier to descend the valley.\r\n\r\nThe lateral expansion of the ice from internal molecular pressure\r\nexplains in a clear and satisfactory manner how rock-basins may be\r\nexcavated by means of land-ice. It also removes the difficulties\r\nwhich have been felt in accounting for the ascent of ice up a steep\r\nslope. The main difficulty besetting the theory of the excavation of\r\nrock-basins by ice is to explain how the ice after entering the basin\r\nmanages to get out again—how the ice at the bottom is made to ascend\r\nthe sloping sides of the basin. Pressure acting from behind, it has\r\nbeen argued by some; but if the basin be deep and its sides steep, this\r\nwill simply cause the ice lying above the level of the basin to move\r\nforward over the surface of the mass filling it. This conclusion is,\r\nhowever, incorrect. The ice filling the basin and the glacier overlying\r\nit are united in one solid mass, so that the latter cannot move over\r\nthe former without shearing; and although the resistance to motion\r\noffered by the sloping sides of the basin may be much greater than the\r\nresistance to shear, still the ice will be slowly dragged out of the\r\nbasin. However, in order to obviate this objection to which I refer,\r\nthe advocates of the glacial origin of lake-basins point out that\r\nthe length of those basins in proportion to their depth is so great\r\nthat the slope up which the ice has to pass is in reality but small.\r\nThis no doubt is true of lake-basins in general, but it does not hold\r\nuniversally true. But the theory does not demand that an ice-formed\r\nlake-basin cannot have steep sides. We have incontestable evidence that\r\nice will pass up a steep slope; and, if ice can pass up a steep slope,\r\nit can excavate a basin with a steep slope. That ice will pass up a\r\nsteep slope is proved by the fact that comparatively deep and narrow\r\nriver valleys are often found striated across, while hills which stood\r\ndirectly in the path of the ice of the glacial epoch are sometimes\r\nfound striated _upwards_ from their base to their summit. Some striking\r\nexamples of striæ running up hill are given by Professor Geikie in\r\nhis “Glacial Drift of Scotland.” I have myself seen a slope striated\r\nupwards so steep that one could not climb it.\r\n\r\nA very good example of a river valley striated across came under\r\nmy observation during the past summer. The Tay, between Cargill\r\nand Stanley (in the centre of the broad plain of Strathmore), has\r\nexcavated, through the Old Red Sandstone, a channel between 200 and\r\n300 feet in depth. The channel here runs at right angles to the path\r\ntaken during the glacial epoch by the great mass of ice coming from\r\nthe North-west Highlands. At a short distance below Cargill, the trap\r\nrising out of the bed of the river is beautifully ice-grooved and\r\nstriated, at right angles to the stream. A trap-dyke, several miles in\r\nlength, crosses the river about a mile above Stanley, forming a rapid,\r\nknown as the Linn of Campsie. This dyke is _moutonnée_ and striated\r\nfrom near the Linn up the sloping bank to the level of the surrounding\r\ncountry, showing that the ice must have ascended a gradient of one in\r\nseven to a height of 300 feet.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been already stated in reference to the resolidifying of\r\nthe molecules in the interstices of the ice, the application of the\r\nmolecular theory to the explanation of the effects under consideration\r\nwill no doubt be apparent. Take the case of the passage of the\r\nice-sheet across a river valley. As the upper surface of the ice-sheet\r\nis constantly receiving heat from the sun and the air in contact with\r\nit, there is consequently a transferrence of heat from above downwards\r\nto the bottom of the sheet. This transferrence of heat from molecule\r\nto molecule is accompanied by the melting and resolidifying of the\r\nsuccessive molecules in the manner already detailed. As the fluid\r\nmolecules tend to flow into adjoining interstices before solidifying\r\nand assuming the crystalline form, the interstices of the ice at the\r\nbottom of the valley are constantly being filled by fluid molecules\r\nfrom above. These molecules no sooner enter the interstices than they\r\npass into the crystalline form, and become, of course, separated from\r\ntheir neighbours by fresh interstices, which new interstices become\r\nfilled by fluid molecules, which, in turn, crystallize, forming fresh\r\ninterstices, and so on. The ice at the bottom of the valley, so long as\r\nthis process continues, is constantly receiving fresh additions from\r\nabove. The ice must therefore expand laterally to make room for these\r\nadditions, which it must do unless the resistance to lateral expansion\r\nbe greater than the force exerted by the molecules in crystallizing.\r\nBut a resistance sufficient to do this must be enormous. The ice at the\r\nbottom of the valley cannot expand laterally without passing up the\r\nsloping sides. In expanding it will take the path of least resistance,\r\nbut the path of least resistance will always be on the side of the\r\nvalley towards which the general mass of the ice above is flowing.\r\n\r\nIt has been shown (Chapter XXVII.) that the ice passing over Strathmore\r\nmust have been over 2,000 feet in thickness. An ice-sheet 2,000 feet\r\nin thickness exerts on its bed a pressure of upwards of 51 tons per\r\nsquare foot. When we reflect that ice under so enormous a pressure,\r\nwith grinding materials lying underneath, was forced by irresistible\r\nmolecular energy up an incline of one in seven, it is not at all\r\nsurprising that the hard trap should be ground down and striated.\r\n\r\nWe can also understand how the softer portions of the rocky surface\r\nover which the ice moved should have been excavated into hollow basins.\r\nWe have also an explanation of the transport of boulders from a lower\r\nto a higher level, for if ice can move from a lower to a higher level,\r\nit of course can carry boulders along with it.\r\n\r\nThe bearing which the foregoing considerations of the manner in which\r\nheat is transmitted through ice have on the question of the cause of\r\nregelation will be considered in the Appendix.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               APPENDIX.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  I.\r\n\r\n             OPINIONS EXPRESSED PREVIOUS TO 1864 REGARDING\r\n           THE INFLUENCE OF THE ECCENTRICITY OF THE EARTH’S\r\n                        ORBIT ON CLIMATE.[312]\r\n\r\n\r\n                             M.

A sensible\r\neffect is probably produced by this source of disturbance, but it is\r\nquite inadequate to explain the whole phenomena. It is, however, of\r\nimportance to the geologist to bear in mind that in consequence of the\r\nprecession of the equinoxes, the two hemispheres receive alternately,\r\neach for a period of upwards of 10,000 years, a greater share of\r\nsolar light and heat. This cause may sometimes tend to counterbalance\r\ninequalities resulting from other circumstances of a far more\r\ninfluential nature; but, on the other hand, it must sometimes tend to\r\nincrease the extreme of deviation, which certain combinations of causes\r\nproduce at distant epochs.”—_Principles_, First Edition, 1830, p. 110,\r\nvol. i.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      SIR JOHN F. HERSCHEL, BART.\r\n\r\nThe following, in so far as it relates to the effects of eccentricity,\r\nis a copy of Sir John Herschel’s memoir, “On the Astronomical Causes\r\nwhich may influence Geological Phenomena,” read before the Geological\r\nSociety, Dec. 15th, 1830.—_Trans. Geol. Soc._, vol. iii., p. 293,\r\nSecond Series:—\r\n\r\n“... Let us next consider the changes arising in the orbit of the earth\r\nitself about the sun, from the disturbing action of the planets. In so\r\ndoing it will be obviously unnecessary to consider the effect produced\r\non the solar tides, to which the above reasoning applies much more\r\nforcibly than in the case of the lunar. It is, therefore, only the\r\nvariations in the supply of light and heat received from the sun that\r\nwe have now to consider.\r\n\r\n“Geometers having demonstrated the absolute invariability of the _mean_\r\ndistance of the earth from the sun, it would seem to follow that\r\nthe mean annual supply of light and heat derived from that luminary\r\nwould be alike invariable; but a closer consideration of the subject\r\nwill show that this would not be a legitimate conclusion, but that,\r\non the contrary, the _mean_ amount of solar radiation is dependent\r\non the eccentricity of the orbit, and therefore liable to variation.\r\nWithout going at present into any geometrical investigations, it will\r\nbe sufficient for the purpose here to state it as a theorem, of which\r\nany one may easily satisfy himself by no very abstruse geometrical\r\nreasoning, that ‘_the eccentricity of the orbit varying, the_ total\r\n_quantity of heat received by the earth from the sun in one revolution\r\nis inversely proportional to the_ minor _axis of the orbit_.’ Now since\r\nthe major axis is, as above observed, invariable, and therefore, of\r\ncourse, the absolute length of the year, it will follow that the _mean\r\nannual_ average of heat will also be in the same inverse ratio of the\r\n_minor_ axis; and thus we see that the very circumstance which on a\r\ncursory view we should have regarded as demonstrative of the constancy\r\nof our supply of solar heat, forms an essential link in the chain of\r\nstrict reasoning by which its variability is proved.\r\n\r\n“The eccentricity of the earth’s orbits is actually diminishing, and\r\nhas been so for ages, beyond the records of history. In consequence,\r\nthe ellipse is in a state of approach to a circle, and its minor\r\naxis being, therefore, on the increase, the annual average of solar\r\nradiation is actually on the _decrease_.\r\n\r\n“So far this is in accordance with the testimony of geological\r\nevidence, which indicates a general refrigeration of climate; but when\r\nwe come to consider the amount of diminution which the eccentricity\r\nmust be supposed to have undergone to render an account of the\r\nvariation which has taken place, we have to consider that, in the first\r\nplace, a great diminution of the eccentricity is required to produce\r\nany sensible increase of the minor axis. This is a purely geometrical\r\nconclusion, and is best shown by the following table:—\r\n\r\n  Eccentricity.   Minor Axis.   Reciprocal or Ratio of\r\n                                   Heat received.\r\n      0·00           1·000             1·000\r\n      0·05           0·999             1·002\r\n      0·10           0·995             1·005\r\n      0·15           0·989             1·011\r\n      0·20           0·980             1·021\r\n      0·25           0·968             1·032\r\n      0·30           0·954             1·048\r\n\r\nBy this it appears that a variation of the eccentricity of the orbit\r\nfrom the circular form to that of an ellipse, having an eccentricity\r\nof one-fourth of the major axis, would produce only a variation of 3\r\nper cent. on the _mean_ annual amount of solar radiation, and this\r\nvariation takes in the whole range of the planetary eccentricities,\r\nfrom that of Pallas and Juno downwards.\r\n\r\n“I am not aware that the limit of increase of the eccentricity of the\r\nearth’s orbit has ever been determined. That it has a limit has been\r\nsatisfactorily proved; but the celebrated theorem of Laplace, which\r\nis usually cited as demonstrating that none of the planetary orbits\r\ncan ever deviate materially from the circular form, leads to no such\r\nconclusion, except in the case of the great preponderant planets\r\nJupiter and Saturn, while for anything that theorem proves to the\r\ncontrary, the orbit of the earth may become elliptic to any amount.\r\n\r\n“In the absence of calculations which though practicable have, I\r\nbelieve, never been made,[315] and would be no slight undertaking, we\r\nmay assume that eccentricities which exist in the orbits of planets,\r\nboth interior and exterior to that of the earth, may _possibly_\r\nhave been attained, and may be attained again by that of the earth\r\nitself. It is clear that such eccentricities _existing_ they cannot\r\nbe incompatible with the stability of the system generally, and that,\r\ntherefore, the question of the possibility of such an amount in the\r\nparticular case of the earth’s orbit will depend on the particular\r\ndata belonging to that case, and can only be determined by executing\r\nthe calculations alluded to, having regard to the simultaneous effects\r\nof at least the four most influential planets, Venus, Mars, Jupiter,\r\nand Saturn, _not only on the orbit of the earth, but on those of each\r\nother_. The principles of this calculation are detailed in the article\r\nof Laplace’s work cited. But before entering on a work of so much\r\nlabour, it is quite necessary to inquire what prospect of advantage\r\nthere is to induce any one to undertake it.\r\n\r\n“Now it certainly at first sight seems clear that a variation of 3\r\nper cent. only in the mean annual amount of solar radiation, and\r\nthat arising from an extreme supposition, does _not_ hold out such a\r\nprospect. Yet it might be argued that the effects of the sun’s heat is\r\nto maintain the temperature of the earth’s surface at its actual mean\r\nheight, not above the zero of Fahrenheit’s or any other thermometer,\r\nbut above the temperature of the celestial spaces, out of the reach of\r\nthe sun’s influence, and what that temperature is may be a matter of\r\nmuch discussion. M. Fourier has considered it as demonstrated that it\r\nis not greatly inferior to that of the polar regions of our own globe,\r\nbut the grounds of this decision appear to me open to considerable\r\nobjection.[316] If those regions be really void of matter, their\r\ntemperature can only arise, according to M. Fourier’s own view of\r\nthe subject, from the radiation of the stars. It ought, therefore,\r\nto be as much inferior to that due to solar radiation, as the light\r\nof a starlight night is to that of the brightest noon day, in other\r\nwords it should be very nearly a total privation of heat—almost the\r\n_absolute zero_ respecting which so much difference of opinion exists,\r\nsome placing it at 1,000°, some at 5,000° of Fahrenheit below the\r\nfreezing-point, and some still lower, in which case a single unit per\r\ncent. in the mean annual amount of radiation would suffice to produce a\r\nchange of climate fully commensurate to the demands of geologists.[317]\r\n\r\n“Without attempting, however, to enter further into the perplexing\r\ndifficulties in which this point is involved, which are far greater\r\nthan appear on a cursory view, let us next consider, not the _mean_,\r\nbut the _extreme_ effects which a variation in the eccentricity of\r\nthe earth’s orbit may be expected to produce in the summer and winter\r\nclimates in particular regions of its surface, and under the influence\r\nof circumstances favouring a difference of effect. And here, if I\r\nmistake not, it will appear that an amount of variation, which we need\r\nnot hesitate to admit (at least, provisionally) as a possible one, may\r\nbe productive of considerable diversity of climate, and may operate\r\nduring great periods of time either to mitigate or to exaggerate\r\nthe difference of winter and summer temperatures, so as to produce\r\nalternately, in the same latitude of either hemisphere, a perpetual\r\nspring, or the extreme vicissitudes of a burning summer and a rigorous\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\n“To show this, let us at once take the extreme case of an orbit as\r\neccentric as that of Juno or Pallas, in which the greatest and least\r\ndistances of the sun are to each other as 5 to 3, and consequently the\r\nradiations at those distances as 25 to 9, or very nearly as 3 to 1. To\r\nconceive what would be the _extreme_ effects of this great variation\r\nof the heat received at different periods of the year, let us first\r\nimagine in our latitude the place of the perigee of the sun to coincide\r\nwith the summer solstice. In that case, the difference between the\r\nsummer and winter temperature would be exaggerated in the same degree\r\nas if three suns were placed side by side in the heavens in the former\r\nseason and only one in the latter, which would produce a climate\r\nperfectly intolerable. On the other hand, were the perigee situated\r\nin the winter solstice our three suns would combine to warm us in the\r\nwinter, and would afford such an excess of winter radiation as would\r\nprobably more than counteract the effect of short days and oblique\r\nsunshine, and throw the summer season into the winter months.\r\n\r\n“The actual diminution of the eccentricity is so slow, that the\r\ntransition from a state of the orbit such as we have assumed to the\r\npresent nearly circular figure would occupy upwards of 600,000 years,\r\nsupposing it uniformly changeable—this, of course, would not be the\r\ncase; when near the maximum, however, it would vary slower still, so\r\nthat at that point it is evident a period of 10,000 years would elapse\r\nwithout any perceptible change in the state of the data of the case we\r\nare considering.\r\n\r\n“Now this adopting the very ingenious idea of Mr. Lyell[318] would\r\nsuffice, by reason of the combined effect of the precession of the\r\nequinoxes and the motion of the apsides of the orbit itself, to\r\ntransfer the perigee from the summer to the winter solstice, and thus\r\nto produce a transition from the one to the other species of climate in\r\na period sufficiently great to give room for a material change in the\r\nbotanical character of country.\r\n\r\n“The supposition above made is an extreme, but it is not demonstrated\r\nto be an impossible one, and should even an approach to such a state\r\nof things be possible, the same consequences, in a mitigated degree,\r\nwould follow. But if, on executing the calculations, it should appear\r\nthat the limits of the eccentricity of the earth’s orbit are really\r\nnarrow, and if, on a full discussion of the very difficult and delicate\r\npoint of the actual effect of solar radiation, it should appear that\r\nthe mean, as well as the extreme, temperature of our climates would\r\n_not_ be materially affected,—it will be at least satisfactory to\r\n_know_ that the causes of the phenomena in question are to be sought\r\nelsewhere than in the relations of our planet to the system to which\r\nit belongs, since there does not appear to exist any other conceivable\r\nconnections between these relations and the facts of geology than\r\nthose we have enumerated, the obliquity of the ecliptic being, as we\r\nknow, confined within too narrow limits for its variation to have any\r\nsensible influence.”—_J. F. W. Herschel._\r\n\r\nThe influence which this paper might have had on the question as\r\nto whether eccentricity may be regarded as a cause of changes in\r\ngeological climate appears to have been completely neutralized by the\r\nfollowing, which appeared shortly afterwards both in his “Treatise” and\r\n“Outlines of Astronomy,” showing evidently that he had changed his mind\r\non the subject.\r\n\r\n“It appears, therefore, from what has been shown, the supplies of heat\r\nreceived from the sun will be equal in the two segments, in whatever\r\ndirection the line PTQ be drawn. They will, indeed, be described in\r\nunequal times: that in which the perihelion A lies in a shorter, and\r\nthe other in a longer, in proportion to their unequal area; but the\r\ngreater proximity of the sun in the smaller segment compensates exactly\r\nfor its more rapid description, and thus an equilibrium of heat is, as\r\nit were, maintained.\r\n\r\n“Were it not for this the eccentricity of the orbit would materially\r\ninfluence the transition of seasons. The fluctuation of distance\r\namounts to nearly 1/30th of the mean quantity, and, consequently,\r\nthe fluctuation of the sun’s direct heating power to double this, or\r\n1/15th of the whole.... Were it not for the compensation we have just\r\ndescribed, the effect would be to exaggerate the difference of summer\r\nand winter in the southern hemisphere, and to moderate it in the\r\nnorthern; thus producing a more violent alternation of climate in the\r\none hemisphere and an approach to perpetual spring in the other. _As it\r\nis, however, no such inequality subsists_, but an equal and impartial\r\ndistribution of heat and light is accorded to both.”—“_Treatise of\r\nAstronomy_,” _Cabinet Cyclopædia_, § 315; _Outlines of Astronomy_, §\r\n368.\r\n\r\n“The fact of a great change in the general climate of large tracts\r\nof the globe, if not of the whole earth, and of a diminution of\r\ngeneral temperature, having been recognised by geologists, from\r\ntheir examination of the remains of animals and vegetables of former\r\nages enclosed in the strata, various causes for such diminution of\r\ntemperature have been assigned.... It is evident that the _mean_\r\ntemperature of the whole surface of the globe, in so far as it is\r\nmaintained by the action of the sun at a higher degree than it would\r\nhave were the sun extinguished, must depend on the mean quantity of\r\nthe sun’s rays which it receives, or, which comes to the same thing,\r\non the _total_ quantity received in a given invariable time; and the\r\nlength of the year being unchangeable in all the fluctuations of the\r\nplanetary system, it follows that the total _annual_ amount of solar\r\nradiation will determine, _cæteris paribus_, the general climate\r\nof the earth. Now, it is not difficult to show that this amount is\r\ninversely proportional to the minor axis of the ellipse described\r\nby the earth about the sun, regarded as slowly variable; and that,\r\ntherefore, the major axis remaining, as we know it to be, constant,\r\nand the orbit being actually in a state of approach to a circle,\r\nand consequently the minor axis being on the _increase_, the mean\r\nannual amount of solar radiation received by the whole earth must\r\nbe actually on the _decrease_. We have here, therefore, an evident\r\nreal cause of sufficient universality, and acting _in the right\r\ndirection_, to account for the phenomenon. Its adequacy is another\r\nconsideration.”[319]—_Discourse on the Study of Natural Philosophy_,\r\npp. 145−147 (1830).\r\n\r\n\r\n                       SIR CHARLES LYELL, BART.\r\n\r\n“_Astronomical Causes of Fluctuations in Climate._—Sir John Herschel\r\nhas lately inquired, whether there are any astronomical causes which\r\nmay offer a possible explanation of the difference between the actual\r\nclimate of the earth’s surface, and those which formerly appear to\r\nhave prevailed. He has entered upon this subject, he says, ‘impressed\r\nwith the magnificence of that view of geological revolutions, which\r\nregards them rather as regular and necessary effects of great and\r\ngeneral causes, than as resulting from a series of convulsions\r\nand catastrophes, regulated by no laws, and reducible to no fixed\r\nprinciples.’ Geometers, he adds, have demonstrated the absolute\r\ninvariability of the mean distance of the earth from the sun; whence\r\nit would seem to follow that the mean annual supply of light and heat\r\nderived from that luminary would be alike invariable; but a closer\r\nconsideration of the subject will show that this would not be a\r\nlegitimate conclusion, but that, on the contrary, the _mean_ amount of\r\nsolar radiation is dependent on the eccentricity of the earth’s orbit,\r\nand, therefore, liable to variation.\r\n\r\n“Now, the eccentricity of the orbit, he continues, is actually\r\ndiminishing, and has been so for ages beyond the records of history.\r\nIn consequence, the ellipse is in a state of approach to a circle, and\r\nthe annual average of solar heat radiated to the earth is actually on\r\nthe _decrease_. So far, this is in accordance with geological evidence,\r\nwhich indicates a general refrigeration of climate; but the question\r\nremains, whether the amount of diminution which the eccentricity may\r\nhave ever undergone can be supposed sufficient to account for any\r\nsensible refrigeration.[320] The calculations necessary to determine\r\nthis point, though practicable, have never yet been made, and would be\r\nextremely laborious; for they must embrace all the perturbations which\r\nthe most influential planets, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, would\r\ncause in the earth’s orbit and in each other’s movements round the sun.\r\n\r\n“The problem is also very complicated, inasmuch as it depends not\r\nmerely on the ellipticity of the earth’s orbit, but on the assumed\r\ntemperature of the celestial spaces beyond the earth’s atmosphere;\r\na matter still open to discussion, and on which M. Fourier and Sir\r\nJ. Herschel have arrived at very different opinions. But if, says\r\nHerschel, we suppose an extreme case, as if the earth’s orbit should\r\never become as eccentric as that of the planet Juno or Pallas, a great\r\nchange of climate might be conceived to result, the winter and summer\r\ntemperatures being sometimes mitigated and at others exaggerated, in\r\nthe same latitudes.\r\n\r\n“It is much to be desired that the calculations alluded to were\r\nexecuted, as even if they should demonstrate, as M. Arago thinks highly\r\nprobable, that the mean of solar radiation can never be materially\r\naffected by irregularities in the earth’s motion, it would still be\r\nsatisfactory to ascertain the point.”—_Principles of Geology_, Ninth\r\nEdition, 1853, p. 127.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               M. ARAGO.\r\n\r\n“_Can the variations which certain astronomical elements undergo\r\nsensibly modify terrestrial climates?_\r\n\r\n“The sun is not always equally distant from the earth. At this time\r\nits least distance is observed in the first days of January, and the\r\ngreatest, six months after, or in the first days of July. But, on the\r\nother hand, a time will come when the _minimum_ will occur in July,\r\nand the _maximum_ in January. Here, then, this interesting question\r\npresents itself,—Should a summer such as those we now have, in which\r\nthe _maximum_ corresponds to the solar distance, differ sensibly, from\r\na summer with which the _minimum_ of this distance should coincide?\r\n\r\n“At first sight every one probably would answer in the affirmative;\r\nfor, between the _maximum_ and the _minimum_ of the sun’s distance\r\nfrom the earth there is a remarkable difference, a difference in round\r\nnumbers of a thirtieth of the whole. Let, however, the consideration of\r\nthe velocities be introduced into the problem, elements which cannot\r\nfairly be neglected, and the result will be on the side opposite to\r\nthat we originally imagined.\r\n\r\n“The part of the orbit where the sun is found nearest the earth, is, at\r\nthe same time, the point where the luminary moves most rapidly along.\r\nThe demi-orbit, or, in other words, the 180° comprehended betwixt the\r\ntwo equinoxes of spring-time and autumn, will then be traversed in the\r\nleast possible time, when, in moving from the one of the extremities\r\nof this arc to the other, the sun shall pass, near the middle of\r\nthis course of six months, at the point of the smallest distance. To\r\nresume—the hypothesis we have just adopted would give, on account of\r\nthe lesser distance, a spring-time and summer hotter than they are in\r\nour days; but on account of the greater rapidity, the sum of the two\r\nseasons would be shorter by about seven days. Thus, then, all things\r\nconsidered, the compensation is mathematically exact. After this it is\r\nsuperfluous to add, that the point of the sun’s orbit corresponding to\r\nthe earth’s least distance changes very gradually; and that since the\r\nmost distant periods, the luminary has always passed by this point,\r\neither at the end of autumn or beginning of winter.\r\n\r\n“We have thus seen that the changes which take place in the _position_\r\nof the solar orbit, _have no power in modifying the climate of our\r\nglobe_. We may now inquire, if it be the same concerning the variations\r\nwhich this orbit experiences in its _form_....\r\n\r\n“Herschel, who has recently been occupying himself with this problem,\r\nin the hope of discovering the explanation of several geological\r\nphenomena, allows that the succession of ages might bring the\r\neccentricity of the terrestrial orbit to the proportion of that of\r\nthe planet Pallas, that is to say, to be the 25/100 of a semi-greater\r\naxis. It is exceedingly improbable that in these periodical changes\r\nthe eccentricity of our orbit should ever experience such enormous\r\nvariations, and even then these twenty-five hundredth parts (25/100),\r\nwould not augment the _mean_ annual solar radiation except by about one\r\nhundredth part (1/100). To repeat, an eccentricity of 25/100 _would not\r\nalter in any appreciated manner the mean thermometrical state of the\r\nglobe_....\r\n\r\n“The changes of the form, and of the position, of the terrestrial\r\norbit are mathematically inoperative, or, at most, their influence is\r\nso minute that it is not indicated by the most delicate instruments.\r\nFor the explanation of the changes of climates, then, there only\r\nremains to us either the local circumstances, or some alteration in\r\nthe heating or illuminating power of the sun. But of these two causes,\r\nwe may continue to reject the last. And thus, in fact, all the changes\r\nwould come to be attributed to agricultural operations, to the clearing\r\nof plains and mountains from wood, the draining of morasses, &c.\r\n\r\n“Thus, at one swoop, to confine, the whole earth, the variations\r\nof climates, past and future, within the limits of the naturally\r\nvery narrow influence which the labour of man can effect, would be\r\na meteorological result of the very last importance.”—pp. 221−224,\r\n_Memoir on the “Thermometrical State of the Terrestrial Globe,” in the\r\nEdinburgh New Philosophical Journal_, vol. xvi., 1834.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            BARON HUMBOLDT.\r\n\r\n“The question,” he says, “has been raised as to whether the increasing\r\nvalue of this ellipticity is capable during thousands of years of\r\nmodifying to any considerable extent the temperature of the earth,\r\nin reference to the daily and annual quantity and distribution of\r\nheat? Whether a partial solution of the great geological problem of\r\nthe imbedding of tropical vegetable and animal remains in the now\r\ncold zones may not be found in these _astronomical_ causes proceeding\r\nregularly in accordance with eternal laws?... It might at the first\r\nglance be supposed that the occurrence of the perihelion at an opposite\r\ntime of the year (instead of the winter, as, is now the case, in\r\nsummer) must necessarily produce great climatic variations; but, on the\r\nabove supposition, the sun will no longer remain seven days longer in\r\nthe northern hemisphere; no longer, as is now the case, traverse that\r\npart of the ecliptic from the autumnal equinox to the vernal equinox,\r\nin a space of time which is one week shorter than that in which it\r\ntraverses the other half of its orbit from the vernal to the autumnal\r\nequinox.\r\n\r\n“The difference of temperature which is considered as the consequence\r\nto be apprehended from the turning of the major axis, _will on the\r\nwhole disappear_, principally from the circumstance that the point of\r\nour planet’s orbit in which it is nearest to the sun is at the same\r\ntime always that over which it passes with the greatest velocity....\r\n\r\n“As the altered position of the major axis is capable of exerting\r\nonly a very _slight influence upon the temperature of the earth;_ so\r\nlikewise the _limit_ of the probable changes in the elliptical form of\r\nthe earth’s orbit are, according to Arago and Poisson, so narrow that\r\nthese changes could _only very slightly_ modify the climates of the\r\nindividual zones, and that in very long periods.”[321]—_Cosmos_, vol.\r\niv., pp. 458, 459.

No calculations having yet been made\r\nas to the probable amount of decreased temperature from this cause,\r\nit can at present be only considered as a possible explanation of\r\nthose geological phenomena which point to considerable alterations in\r\nclimates.”—_Geological Manual_.

The total amount\r\nof solar radiation which determines the general climate of the earth,\r\nthe year being of invariable length, is inversely proportional to\r\nthe minor axis of the ellipse described by the earth about the sun,\r\nregarded as slowly variable; the major axis remaining constant and\r\nthe orbit being actually in a state of approach to a circle, and,\r\nconsequently, the minor axis being on the increase, it follows that\r\nthe mean annual amount of solar radiation received by the whole earth\r\nmust be actually on the decrease. The limits of the variation in the\r\neccentricity of the earth’s orbit are not known. It is, therefore,\r\nimpossible to say accurately what may have been in former periods of\r\ntime, the amount of solar radiation; it is, however, certain that\r\nif the ellipticity has ever been so great as that of the orbit of\r\nMercury or Pallas, the temperature of the earth must have been sensibly\r\nhigher than it is at present. But the difference of a few degrees of\r\ntemperature thus occasioned, is of too small an order to be employed\r\nin explaining the growth of tropical plants and corals in the polar\r\nor temperate zones, and other great phenomena of Geology.”—_From A\r\nTreatise on Geology_, p. 11, _forming the article under that head in\r\nthe seventh edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica_. 1837.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         MR.

The orbit of the earth is an ellipsis\r\napproaching nearly to a circle; the distance from the centre of the\r\norbit to either focus of the ellipsis is called by astronomers ‘the\r\neccentricity of the orbit.’ This eccentricity has been for ages slowly\r\ndecreasing, or, in other words, the orbit of the earth has been\r\napproaching nearer to the form of a perfect circle; after a long period\r\nit will again increase, and the possible extent of the variation has\r\nnot been yet ascertained. From what is known respecting the orbits of\r\nJupiter and Saturn, it appears highly probable that the eccentricity of\r\nthe earth’s orbit is confined within limits that preclude the belief\r\nof any great change in the mean annual temperature of the globe ever\r\nhaving been occasioned by this cause.”—_Introduction to Geology_, p.\r\n600. 1838.

MEECH, A.M.\r\n\r\n“Let us, then, look back to that primeval epoch when the earth\r\nwas in aphelion at midsummer, and the eccentricity at its maximum\r\nvalue—assigned by Leverrier near to ·0777. Without entering into\r\nelaborate computation, it is easy to see that the extreme values\r\nof diurnal intensity, in Section IV., would be altered as by the\r\nmultiplier ((1 ± _e_)/(1 ± _e′_))^2, that is 1 - 0·11 in summer, and 1\r\n+ 0·11 in winter. This would diminish the midsummer intensity by about\r\n9°, and increase the midwinter intensity by 3° or 4°; the temperature\r\nof spring and autumn being nearly unchanged. But this does not appear\r\nto be of itself adequate to the geological effects in question.\r\n\r\n“It is not our purpose, here, to enter into the inquiry whether the\r\natmosphere was once more dense than now, whether the earth’s axis\r\nhad once a different inclination to the orbit, or the sun a greater\r\nemissive power of heat and light. Neither shall we attempt to speculate\r\nupon the primitive heat of the earth, nor of planetary space, nor of\r\nthe supposed connection of terrestrial heat and magnetism; nor inquire\r\nhow far the existence of coal-fields in this latitude, of fossils,\r\nand other geological remains, have depended upon existing causes. The\r\npreceding discussion seems to prove simply that, under the present\r\nsystem of physical astronomy, the sun’s intensity could never have been\r\nmaterially different from what is manifested upon the earth at the\r\npresent day. _The causes of notable geological changes must be other\r\nthan the relative position of the sun and earth, under their present\r\nlaws of motion._”—_“On the Relative Intensity of the Heat and Light of\r\nthe Sun.” Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge_, vol. ix.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           M. JEAN REYNAUD.\r\n\r\n“La révolution qui pourrait y causer les plus grands changements\r\nthermométriques, celle qui porte l’orbite à s’élargir et à se rétrécir\r\nalternativement et, par suite, la planète à passer, aux époques de\r\npérihélie, plus ou moins près du soleil, embrasse une période de plus\r\nde cent mille années terrestres et demeure comprise dans de si étroites\r\nlimites que les habitants doivent être à peine avertis que la chaleur\r\ndécroît, par cette raison, depuis une haute antiquité et décroîtra\r\nencore pendant des siècles en variant en même temps dans sa répartition\r\nselon les diverses époques de l’année.... Enfin, le tournoiement de\r\nl’axe du globe s’empreint également d’une manière particulière sur\r\nl’ètablissement des saisons qui, à tour de rôle, dans chacun des deux\r\nhémisphères, deviennent graduellement, durant une période d’environ\r\nvingt-cinq mille ans, de plus en plus uniformes, ou, à l’inverse, de\r\nplus en plus dissemblables.

ADHÉMAR.\r\n\r\nAdhémar does not consider the effects which ought to result from a\r\nchange in the eccentricity of the earth’s orbit; he only concerns\r\nhimself with those which, in his opinion, arise from the present amount\r\nof such eccentricity. He admits, of course, that both hemispheres\r\nreceive from the sun equal quantities of heat per annum; but, as\r\nthe southern hemisphere has a winter longer by 168 hours than the\r\ncorresponding season in the northern hemisphere, an accumulation of\r\nheat necessarily takes place in the latter, and an accumulation of\r\ncold in the former. Adhémar also measures the loss of heat sustained\r\nby the southern hemisphere in a year by the number of hours by which\r\nthe southern exceeds the northern winter. “The south pole,” he says,\r\n“loses in one year more heat than it receives, because the total\r\nduration of its nights surpasses that of the days by 168 hours; and the\r\ncontrary takes place for the north pole. If, for example, we take for\r\nunity the mean quantity of heat which the sun sends off in one hour,\r\nthe heat accumulated at the end of the year at the north pole will be\r\nexpressed by 168, while the heat lost by the south pole will be equal\r\nto 168 times what the radiation lessens it by in one hour; so that at\r\nthe end of the year the difference in the heat of the two hemispheres\r\nwill be represented by 336 times what the earth receives from the sun\r\nor loses in an hour by radiation,”[322] and at the end of 100 years the\r\ndifference will be 33,600 times, and at the end of 1,000 years 336,000\r\ntimes, or equal to what the earth receives from the sun in 38½ years,\r\nand so on during the 10,000 years that the southern winter exceeds in\r\nlength the northern. This, in his opinion, is all that is required to\r\nmelt the ice off the arctic regions, and cover the antarctic regions\r\nwith an enormous ice-cap. He further supposes that in about 10,000\r\nyears, when our northern winter will occur in aphelion and the southern\r\nin perihelion, the climatic conditions of the two hemispheres will be\r\nreversed; that is to say, the ice will melt at the south pole, and the\r\nnorthern hemisphere will become enveloped in one continuous mass of\r\nice, leagues in thickness, extending down to temperate regions.\r\n\r\nThis theory, as shown in Chapter V., is based upon a misconception\r\nregarding the laws of radiant heat. The loss of heat sustained by the\r\nsouthern hemisphere from radiation, resulting from the greater length\r\nof the southern winter, is vastly over-estimated by M. Adhémar, and\r\ncould not possibly produce the effects which he supposes. But I need\r\nnot enter into this subject here, as the reader will find the whole\r\nquestion discussed at length in the chapter above referred to. By far\r\nthe most important part of Adhemar’s theory, however, is his conception\r\nof the submergence of the land by means of a polar ice-cap. He appears\r\nto have been the first to put forth the idea that a mass of ice placed\r\non the globe, say, for example, at the south pole, will shift the\r\nearth’s centre of gravity a little to the south of its former position,\r\nand thus, as a physical consequence, cause the sea to sink at the\r\nnorth pole and to rise at the south. According to Adhémar, as the one\r\nhemisphere cools and the other grows warmer, the ice at the pole of the\r\nformer will increase in thickness and that at the pole of the latter\r\ndiminish.\r\n\r\nThe sea, as a consequence, will sink on the warm hemisphere where the\r\nice is decreasing and rise on the cold hemisphere where the ice is\r\nincreasing. And, again, in 10,000 years, when the climatic conditions\r\nof the two hemispheres are reversed, the sea will sink on the\r\nhemisphere where it formerly rose, and rise on the hemisphere where it\r\nformerly sank, and so on in like manner through indefinite ages.\r\n\r\nAdhémar, however, acknowledges to have derived the grand conception\r\nof a submergence of the land from the shifting of the earth’s centre\r\nof gravity from the following wild speculation of one Bertrand, of\r\nHamburgh:—\r\n\r\n“Bertrand de Hambourg, dans un ouvrage imprimé en 1799 et qui a\r\npour titre: _Renouvellement périodique des Continents_, avait déjà\r\némis cette idée, que la masse des eaux pouvait être alternativement\r\nentraînée d’un hémisphère à l’autre par le déplacement du centre de\r\ngravité du globe. Or, pour expliquer ce déplacement, il supposait que\r\nla terre était creuse et qu’il y avait dans son intérieur un gros noyau\r\nd’aimant auquel les comètes par leur attraction communiquaient un\r\nmouvement de va-et-vient analogue à celui du pendule.”—_Révolutions de\r\nla Mer_, p. 41.\r\n\r\nThe somewhat extravagant notions which Adhémar has advanced in\r\nconnection with his theory of submergence have very much retarded\r\nits acceptance. Amongst other remarkable views he supposes the polar\r\nice-cap to rest on the bottom of the ocean, and to rise out of the\r\nwater to the enormous height of twenty leagues. Again, he holds that\r\non the winter approaching perihelion and the hemisphere becoming warm\r\nthe ice waxes soft and rotten from the accumulated heat, and the sea\r\nnow beginning to eat into the base of the cap, this is so undermined\r\nas, at last, to be left standing upon a kind of gigantic pedestal. This\r\ndisintegrating process goes on till the fatal moment at length arrives,\r\nwhen the whole mass tumbles down into the sea in huge fragments which\r\nbecome floating icebergs. The attraction of the opposite ice-cap, which\r\nhas by this time nearly reached its maximum thickness, becomes now\r\npredominant. The earth’s centre of gravity suddenly crosses the plain\r\nof the equator, dragging the ocean along with it, and carrying death\r\nand destruction to everything on the surface of the globe. And these\r\ncatastrophes, he asserts, occur alternately on the two hemispheres\r\nevery 10,000 years.—_Révolutions de la Mer_, pp. 316−328.\r\n\r\nAdhémar’s theory has been advocated by M.

The force of cohesion binding the\r\nmolecules together exercises no effect on the rapidity of vibration.\r\n\r\nI had arrived at the same conclusion from theoretical considerations\r\nseveral years ago, and had also deduced some further conclusions\r\nregarding the nature of heat-vibrations, which seem to be in a measure\r\nconfirmed by the experimental results of Professor Tyndall. One of\r\nthese conclusions was, that the heat-vibration does not consist in\r\na motion of an aggregate mass of molecules, but in a motion of the\r\nindividual molecules themselves. Each molecule, or rather we should\r\nsay each atom, acts as if there were no other in existence but\r\nitself. Whether the atom stands by itself as in the gaseous state,\r\nor is bound to other atoms as in the liquid or the solid state, it\r\nbehaves in exactly the same manner. The deeper question then suggested\r\nitself, viz., what is the nature of that mysterious motion called heat\r\nassumed by the atom? Does it consist in excursions across centres\r\nof equilibrium external to the atom itself? It is the generally\r\nreceived opinion among physicists that it does. But I think that the\r\nexperimental results arrived at by Professor Tyndall, as well as some\r\nothers which will presently be noticed, are entirely hostile to such an\r\nopinion. The relation of an atom to its centre of equilibrium depends\r\nentirely on the state of aggregation. Now if heat-vibrations consist in\r\nexcursions to and fro across these centres, then the _period_ ought to\r\nbe affected by the state of aggregation. The higher the _tension_ of\r\nthe atom in regard to the centre, the more rapid ought its movement to\r\nbe. This is the case in regard to the vibrations constituting sound.\r\nThe harder a body becomes, or, in other words, the more firmly its\r\nmolecules are bound together, the higher is the _pitch_. Two harp-cords\r\nstruck with equal force will vibrate with equal force, however much\r\nthey may differ in the rapidity of their vibrations. The _vis viva_\r\nof vibration depends upon the force of the stroke; but the rapidity\r\ndepends, not on the stroke, but upon the tension of the cord.\r\n\r\nThat heat-vibrations do not consist in excursions of the molecules\r\nor atoms across centres of equilibrium, follows also as a necessary\r\nconsequence from the fact that the real specific heat of a body remains\r\nunchanged under all conditions. All changes in the specific heat of a\r\nbody are due to differences in the amount of heat consumed in molecular\r\nwork against cohesion or other forces binding the molecules together.\r\nOr, in other words, to produce in a body no other effect than a given\r\nrise of temperature, requires the same amount of force, whatever may be\r\nthe physical condition of the body. Whether the body be in the solid,\r\nthe fluid, or the gaseous condition, the same rise of temperature\r\nalways indicates the same quantity of force consumed in the simple\r\nproduction of the rise. Now, if heat-vibrations consist in excursions\r\nof the atom to and fro across a centre of equilibrium _external to\r\nitself_, as is generally supposed, then the _real_ specific heat of a\r\nsolid body, for example, _ought to decrease with the hardness of the\r\nbody_, because an increase in the strength of the force binding the\r\nmolecules together would in such a case tend to favour the rise in the\r\nrapidity of the vibrations.\r\n\r\nThese conclusions not only afford us an insight into the hidden nature\r\nof heat-vibrations, but they also appear to cast some light on the\r\nphysical constitution of the atom itself. They seem to lead to the\r\nconclusion that the ultimate atom itself is _essentially elastic_.[324]\r\nFor if heat-vibrations do not consist in excursions of the atom, then\r\nit must consist in alternate expansions and contractions of the atom\r\nitself. This again is opposed to the ordinary idea that the atom is\r\nessentially solid and impenetrable. But it favours the modern idea,\r\nthat matter consists of forces of resistance acting from a centre.\r\n\r\nProfessor Tyndall in a memoir read before the Royal Society “On a new\r\nSeries of Chemical Reactions produced by Light,” has subsequently\r\narrived at a similar conclusion in reference to the atomic nature of\r\nheat-vibrations. The following are his views on the subject:—\r\n\r\n“A question of extreme importance in molecular physics here\r\narises:—What is the real mechanism of this absorption, and where is its\r\nseat?\r\n\r\n“I figure, as others do, a molecule as a group of atoms, held together\r\nby their mutual forces, but still capable of motion among themselves.\r\nThe vapour of the nitrite of amyl is to be regarded as an assemblage\r\nof such molecules. The question now before us is this:—In the act\r\nof absorption, is it the _molecules_ that are effective, or is it\r\ntheir constituent _atoms?_ Is the _vis viva_ of the intercepted waves\r\ntransferred to the molecule as a whole, or to its constituent parts?\r\n\r\n“The molecule, as a whole, can only vibrate in virtue of the forces\r\nexerted between it and its neighbour molecules. The intensity of these\r\nforces, and consequently the rate of vibration, would, in this case,\r\nbe a function of the distance between the molecules. Now the identical\r\nabsorption of the liquid and of the vaporous nitrite of amyl indicates\r\nan identical vibrating period on the part of liquid and vapour, and\r\nthis, to my mind, amounts to an experimental demonstration that the\r\nabsorption occurs in the main _within_ the molecule. For it can hardly\r\nbe supposed, if the absorption were the act of the molecule as a whole,\r\nthat it could continue to affect waves of the same period after the\r\nsubstance had passed from the vaporous to the liquid state.”—_Proc. of\r\nRoy. Soc._, No. 105. 1868.\r\n\r\nProfessor W. A. Norton, in his memoir on “Molecular Physics,”[325] has\r\nalso arrived at results somewhat similar in reference to the nature of\r\nheat-vibrations. “It will be seen,” he says, “that these (Mr. Croll’s)\r\nideas are in accordance with the conception of the constitution of a\r\nmolecule adopted at the beginning of the present memoir (p. 193), and\r\nwith the theory of heat-vibrations or heat-pulses deduced therefrom (p.\r\n196).”[326]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 III.\r\n\r\n  ON THE REASON WHY THE DIFFERENCE OF READING BETWEEN A\r\n      THERMOMETER EXPOSED TO DIRECT SUNSHINE AND ONE SHADED\r\n      DIMINISHES AS WE ASCEND IN THE ATMOSPHERE.[327]\r\n\r\n\r\n          From the _Philosophical Magazine_ for March, 1867.\r\n\r\nThe remarkable fact was observed by Mr. Glaisher, that the difference\r\nof reading between a black-bulb thermometer exposed to the direct rays\r\nof the sun and one shaded diminishes as we ascend in the atmosphere.\r\nOn viewing the matter under the light of Professor Tyndall’s important\r\ndiscovery regarding the influence of aqueous vapour on radiant heat,\r\nthe fact stated by Mr. Glaisher appears to be in perfect harmony with\r\ntheory. The following considerations will perhaps make this plain.\r\n\r\nThe shaded thermometer marks the temperature of the surrounding\r\nair; but the exposed thermometer marks not the temperature of the\r\nair, but that of the bulb heated by the direct rays of the sun. The\r\ntemperature of the bulb depends upon two elements: (1) the rate at\r\nwhich it receives heat by _direct radiation_ from the sun above, the\r\nearth beneath, and all surrounding objects, and by _contact_ with the\r\nair; (2) the rate at which it loses heat by radiation and by contact\r\nwith the air. As regards the heat gained and lost by contact with the\r\nsurrounding air, both thermometers are under the same conditions,\r\nor nearly so. We therefore require only to consider the element of\r\nradiation.\r\n\r\nWe begin by comparing the two thermometers at the earth’s surface, and\r\nwe find that they differ by a very considerable number of degrees.\r\nWe now ascend some miles into the air, and on again comparing the\r\nthermometers we find that the difference between them has greatly\r\ndiminished. It has been often proved, by direct observation, that the\r\nintensity of the sun’s rays increases as we rise in the atmosphere.\r\nHow then does the exposed thermometer sink more rapidly than the\r\nshaded one as we ascend? The reason is obviously this. The temperature\r\nof the thermometers depends as much upon the rate at which they are\r\nlosing their heat as upon the rate at which they are gaining it.\r\nThe higher temperature of the exposed thermometer is the result of\r\n_direct radiation_ from the sun. Now, although this thermometer\r\nreceives by radiation more heat from the sun at the upper position\r\nthan at the lower, it does not necessarily follow on this account\r\nthat its temperature ought to be higher. Suppose that at the upper\r\nposition it should receive one-fourth more heat from the sun than at\r\nthe lower, yet if the rate at which it loses its heat by radiation\r\ninto space be, say, one-third greater at the upper position than at\r\nthe lower, the temperature of the bulb would sink to a considerable\r\nextent, notwithstanding the extra amount of heat received. Let us now\r\nreflect on how matters stand in this respect in regard to the actual\r\ncase under our consideration. When the exposed thermometer is at the\r\nhigher position, it receives more heat from the sun than at the lower,\r\nbut it receives less from the earth; for a considerable part of the\r\nradiation from the earth is cut off by the screen of aqueous vapour\r\nintervening between the thermometer and the earth. But, on the whole,\r\nit is probable that the total quantity of radiant heat reaching the\r\nthermometer is greater in the higher position than in the lower.\r\nCompare now the two positions in regard to the rate at which the\r\nthermometer loses its heat by radiation. When the thermometer is at the\r\nlower position, it has the warm surface of the ground against which to\r\nradiate its heat downwards. The high temperature of the ground thus\r\ntends to diminish the rate of radiation. Above, there is a screen of\r\naqueous vapour throwing back upon the thermometer a very considerable\r\npart of the heat which the instrument is radiating upwards. This, of\r\ncourse, tends greatly to diminish the loss from radiation. But at\r\nthe upper position this very screen, which prevented the thermometer\r\nfrom throwing off its heat into the cold space above, now affects\r\nthe instrument in an opposite manner; for the thermometer has now to\r\nradiate its heat downwards, not upon the warm surface of the ground\r\nas before, but upon the cold upper surface of the aqueous screen\r\nintervening between the instrument and the earth. This of course tends\r\nto lower the mercury. We are now in a great measure above the aqueous\r\nscreen, with nothing to protect the thermometer from the influence of\r\ncold stellar space. It is true that the air above is at a temperature\r\nlittle below that of the thermometer itself; but then the air is dry,\r\nand, owing to its diathermancy, it does not absorb the heat radiated\r\nfrom the thermometer, and consequently the instrument radiates its heat\r\ndirectly into the cold stellar space above, some hundreds of degrees\r\nbelow zero, almost the same as it would do were the air entirely\r\nremoved. The enormous loss of heat which the thermometer now sustains\r\ncauses it to fall in temperature to a great extent. The molecules of\r\nthe comparatively dry air at this elevation, being very bad radiators,\r\ndo not throw off their heat into space so rapidly as the bulb of the\r\nexposed thermometer; consequently their temperature does not (for this\r\nreason) tend to sink so rapidly as that of the bulb. Hence the shaded\r\nthermometer, which indicates the temperature of those molecules, is\r\nnot affected to such an extent as the exposed one. Hence also the\r\ndifference of reading between the two instruments must diminish as we\r\nrise in the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThis difference between the temperature of the two thermometers\r\nevidently does not go on diminishing to an indefinite extent. Were we\r\nable to continue our ascent in the atmosphere, we should certainly\r\nfind that a point would be reached beyond which the difference of\r\nreading would begin to increase, and would continue to do so till the\r\nouter limits of the atmosphere were reached. The difference between\r\nthe temperatures of the two thermometers beyond the limits of the\r\natmosphere would certainly be enormous. The thermometer exposed to\r\nthe direct rays of the sun would no doubt be much colder than it had\r\nbeen when at the earth’s surface; but the shaded thermometer would\r\nnow indicate the temperature of space, which, according to Sir John\r\nHerschel and M. Pouillet, is more than 200° Fahrenheit below zero.\r\n\r\nIt follows also, from what has been stated, that even under direct\r\nsunshine the removal of the earth’s atmosphere would tend to lower the\r\ntemperature of the earth’s surface to a great extent. This conclusion\r\nalso follows as an immediate inference from the fact that the earth’s\r\natmosphere, as it exists at present charged with aqueous vapour,\r\naffects terrestrial radiation more than it does radiation from the sun;\r\nfor the removal of the atmosphere would increase the rate at which the\r\nearth throws off its heat into space more than it would increase the\r\nrate at which it receives heat from the sun; therefore its temperature\r\nwould necessarily fall until the rate of radiation _from_ the earth’s\r\nsurface exactly equalled the rate of radiation _to_ the surface. Let\r\nthe atmosphere again envelope the earth, and terrestrial radiation\r\nwould instantly be diminished; the temperature of the earth’s surface\r\nwould therefore necessarily begin to rise, and would continue to do so\r\ntill the rate of radiation from the surface would equal the rate of\r\nradiation received by the surface. Equilibrium being thus restored, the\r\ntemperature would remain stationary. It is perfectly obvious that if we\r\nenvelope the earth with a substance such as our atmosphere, that offers\r\nmore resistance to terrestrial radiation than to solar, the temperature\r\nof the earth’s surface must necessarily rise until the heat which is\r\nbeing radiated off equals that which is being received from the sun.\r\nRemove the air and thus get quit of the resistance, and the temperature\r\nof the surface would fall, because in this case a lower temperature\r\nwould maintain equilibrium.\r\n\r\nIt follows, therefore, that the moon, which has no atmosphere, must\r\nbe much colder than our earth, even on the side exposed to the sun.\r\nWere our earth with its atmosphere as it exists at present removed to\r\nthe orbit of Venus or Mars, for example, it certainly would not be\r\nhabitable, owing to the great change of temperature that would result.\r\nBut a change in the physical constitution of the atmospheric envelope\r\nis really all that would be necessary to retain the earth’s surface at\r\nits present temperature in either position.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  IV.\r\n\r\n        REMARKS ON MR. J. Y. BUCHANAN’S THEORY OF THE VERTICAL\r\n            DISTRIBUTION OF TEMPERATURE OF THE OCEAN.[328]\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the foregoing was in type, a paper on the “Vertical Distribution\r\nof Temperature of the Ocean,” by Mr. J. Y. Buchanan, chemist on board\r\nthe _Challenger_, has been read before the Royal Society.[329] In that\r\npaper Mr. Buchanan endeavours to account for the great depth of warm\r\nwater in the middle of the North Atlantic compared with that at the\r\nequator, without referring it to horizontal circulation of any kind.\r\n\r\nThe following is the theory as stated by Mr. Buchanan:—\r\n\r\n“Let us assume the winter temperature of the surface-water to be 60° F.\r\nand the summer temperature to be 70° F. If we start from midwinter, we\r\nfind that, as summer approaches, the surface-water must get gradually\r\nwarmer, and that the temperature of the layers below the surface must\r\ndecrease at a very rapid rate, until the stratum of winter temperature,\r\nor 60° F., is reached; in the language of the isothermal charts, the\r\nisothermal line for degrees between 70° F. (if we suppose that we have\r\narrived at midsummer) and 60° F. open out or increase their distance\r\nfrom each other as the depth increases. Let us now consider the\r\nconditions after the summer heat has begun to waver. During the whole\r\nperiod of heating, the water, from its increasing temperature, has been\r\nalways becoming lighter, so that heat communication by convection with\r\nthe water below has been entirely suspended during the whole period.\r\nThe heating of the surface-water has, however, had another effect,\r\nbesides increasing its volume; it has, by evaporation, rendered it\r\ndenser than it was before, at the same temperature. Keeping in view\r\nthis double effect of the summer heat upon the surface-water, let us\r\nconsider the effect of the winter cold upon it. The superficial water\r\nhaving assumed the atmospheric temperature of, say 60° F., will sink\r\nthrough the warmer water below it, until it reaches the stratum of\r\nwater having the same temperature as itself. Arrived here, however,\r\nalthough it has the same temperature as the surrounding water,\r\nthe two are no longer in equilibrium, for the water which has come\r\nfrom the surface, has a greater density than that below at the same\r\ntemperature. It will therefore not be arrested at the stratum of the\r\nsame temperature, as would have been the case with fresh water; but it\r\nwill continue to sink, carrying of course its higher temperature with\r\nit, and distributing it among the lower layers of colder water. At\r\nthe end of the winter, therefore, and just before the summer heating\r\nrecommences, we shall have at the surface a more or less thick stratum\r\nof water having a nearly uniform temperature of 60° F., and below this\r\nthe temperature decreasing at a considerable but less rapid rate than\r\nat the termination of the summer heating. If we distinguish between\r\n_surface-water_, the temperature of which rises with the atmospheric\r\ntemperature (following thus, in direction at least, the variation of\r\nthe seasons), and _subsurface_-water, or the stratum immediately below\r\nit, we have for the latter the, at first sight, paradoxical effect of\r\nsummer cooling and winter heating. The effect of this agency is to\r\ndiffuse the same heat to a greater depth in the ocean, the greater the\r\nyearly range of atmospheric temperature at the surface. This effect\r\nis well shown in the chart of isothermals, on a vertical section,\r\nbetween Madeira and a position in lat. 3° 8′ N., long. 14° 49′ W. The\r\nisothermal line for 45° F. rises from a depth of 740 fathoms at Madeira\r\nto 240 fathoms at the above-mentioned position. In equatorial regions\r\nthere is hardly any variation in the surface-temperature of the sea;\r\nconsequently we find cold water very close to the surface all along the\r\nline. On referring to the temperature section between the position lat.\r\n3° 8′ N., long. 14° 49′ W., and St. Paul’s Rocks, it will be seen that,\r\nwith a surface-temperature of from 75° F. to 79° F., water at 55° F. is\r\nreached at distances of less than 100 fathoms from the surface. Midway\r\nbetween the Azores and Bermuda, with a surface-temperature of 70° F.,\r\nit is only at a depth of 400 fathoms that we reach water of 55° F.”\r\n\r\nWhat Mr. Buchanan states will explain why the mean annual temperature\r\nof the water at the surface extends to a greater depth in the middle\r\nof the North Atlantic than at the equator. It also explains why the\r\ntemperature from the surface downwards decreases more rapidly at the\r\nequator than in the middle of the North Atlantic; but, if I rightly\r\nunderstand the theory, it does not explain (and this is the point at\r\nissue) why at a given depth the temperature of the water in the North\r\nAtlantic should be higher than the temperature at a corresponding depth\r\nat the equator. Were there no horizontal circulation the greatest\r\nthickness of warm water would certainly be found at the equator and\r\nthe least at the poles. The isothermals would in such a case gradually\r\nslope downwards from the poles to the equator. The slope might not be\r\nuniform, but still it would be a continuous downward slope.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  V.\r\n\r\n       ON THE CAUSE OF THE COOLING EFFECT PRODUCED ON SOLIDS BY\r\n                             TENSION.[330]\r\n\r\n\r\n           From the _Philosophical Magazine_ for May, 1864.\r\n\r\nFrom a series of experiments made by Dr. Joule with his usual accuracy,\r\nhe found that when bodies are subjected to tension, a cooling effect\r\ntakes place. “The quantity of cold,” he says, “produced by the\r\napplication of tension was sensibly equal to the heat evolved by its\r\nremoval; and further, that the thermal effects were proportional to\r\nthe weight employed.”[331] He found that when a weight was applied to\r\ncompress a body, a certain amount of heat was evolved; but the same\r\nweight, if applied to stretch the body, produced a corresponding amount\r\nof cold.\r\n\r\nThis, although it does not appear to have been remarked, is a most\r\nsingular result. If we employ a force to compress a body, and then ask\r\nwhat has become of the force applied, it is quite a satisfactory answer\r\nto be told that the force is converted into heat, and reappears in the\r\nmolecules of the body as such; but if the same force be employed to\r\nstretch the body, it will be no answer to be told that the force is\r\nconverted into cold. Cold cannot be the force under another form, for\r\ncold is a privation of force. If a body, for example, is compressed by\r\na weight, the _vis viva_ of the descending weight is transmitted to the\r\nmolecules of the body and reappears under that form of force called\r\nheat; but if the same weight is applied so as to stretch or expand the\r\nbody, not only does the force of the weight disappear without producing\r\nheat, but the molecules which receive the force lose part of that\r\nwhich they already possessed. Not only does the force of the weight\r\ndisappear, but along with it a portion of the force previously existing\r\nin the molecules under the form of heat. We have therefore to inquire,\r\nnot merely into what becomes of the force imparted by the weight, but\r\nalso what becomes of the force in the form of heat which disappears\r\nfrom the molecules of the body itself. That the _vis viva_ of the\r\ndescending weight should disappear without increasing the heat of the\r\nmolecules is not so surprising, because it may be transformed into some\r\nother form of force different from that of heat. For it is by no means\r\nevident _à priori_ that heat should be the only form under which it\r\nmay exist. But it is somewhat strange that it should cause the force\r\npreviously existing in the molecules in the form of heat also to change\r\ninto some other form.\r\n\r\nWhen a weight, for example, is employed to stretch a solid body, it\r\nis evident that the force exerted by the weight is consumed in work\r\nagainst the cohesion of the particles, for the entire force is exerted\r\nso as to pull them separate from each other. But the cooling effect\r\nwhich takes place shows that more force disappears than simply what\r\nis exerted by the weight; for the cooling effect is caused by the\r\ndisappearance of force in the shape of heat from the body itself. The\r\nforce exerted by the weight disappears in performing work against the\r\ncohesion of the particles of the body stretched. But what becomes\r\nof the energy in the form of heat which disappears from the body at\r\nthe same time? It must be consumed in performing work of some kind\r\nor other. The force exerted by the weight cannot be the cause of the\r\ncooling effect. The transferrence of force from the weight to the body\r\nmay be the cause of a heating effect—an increase of force in the body;\r\nbut this transferrence of force to the body cannot be the cause of a\r\ndecrease of force in the body. If a decrease of force actually follows\r\nthe application of tension, the weight can only be the occasion, not\r\nthe cause of the decrease.\r\n\r\nIn what manner, then, does the stretching of the body by the weight\r\nbecome the occasion of its losing energy in the shape of heat? Or, in\r\nother words, what is the cause of the cooling effects which result\r\nfrom tension? The probable explanation of the phenomenon seems to\r\nbe this: if the molecules of a body are held together by any force,\r\nof whatever nature it may be, which prevents any further separation\r\ntaking place, then the entire heat applied to such a body will appear\r\nas temperature; but if this binding force becomes lessened so as to\r\nallow further expansion, then a portion of the heat applied will be\r\nlost in producing expansion. All solids at any given temperature expand\r\nuntil the expansive force of their heat exactly balances the cohesive\r\nforce of their molecules, after which no further expansion at the\r\nsame temperature can possibly take place while the cohesive force of\r\nthe molecules remains unchanged. But if, by some means or other, the\r\ncohesive force of the molecules become reduced, then instantly the\r\nbody will expand under the heat which it possesses, and of course a\r\nportion of the heat will be consumed in expansion, and a cooling effect\r\nwill result. Now tension, although it does not actually lessen the\r\ncohesive force of the molecules of the stretched body, yet produces, by\r\ncounteracting this force, the same effect; for it allows the molecules\r\nan opportunity of performing work of expansion, and a cooling effect\r\nis the consequence. If the piston of a steam-engine, for example, be\r\nloaded to such an extent that the steam is unable to move it, the steam\r\nin the interior of the cylinder will not lose any of its heat; but if\r\nthe piston be raised by some external force, the molecules of the steam\r\nwill assist this force, and consequently will suffer loss of heat in\r\nproportion to the amount of work which they perform. The very same\r\noccurs when tension is applied to a solid. Previous to the application\r\nof tension, the heat existing in the molecules is unable to produce\r\nany expansion against the force of cohesion. But when the influence of\r\ncohesion is partly counteracted by the tension applied, the heat then\r\nbecomes enabled to perform work of expansion, and a cooling effect is\r\nthe result.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  VI.\r\n\r\n                     THE CAUSE OF REGELATION.[332]\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are two theories which have been advanced to explain Regelation,\r\nthe one by Professor Faraday, and the other by Professor James Thomson.\r\n\r\nAccording to Professor James Thomson, pressure is the cause of\r\nregelation. Pressure applied to ice tends to lower the melting-point,\r\nand thus to produce liquefaction; but the water which results is\r\ncolder than the ice, and refreezes the moment it is relieved from\r\npressure. When two pieces of ice are pressed together, a melting takes\r\nplace at the points in contact, resulting from the lowering of the\r\nmelting-point; the water formed, re-freezing, joins the two pieces\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nThe objection which has been urged against this theory is that\r\nregelation will take place under circumstances where it is difficult to\r\nconceive how pressure can be regarded as the cause. Two pieces of ice,\r\nfor example, suspended by silken threads in an atmosphere above the\r\nmelting-point, if but simply allowed to touch each other, will freeze\r\ntogether. Professor J. Thomson, however, attributes the freezing to\r\nthe pressure resulting from the capillary attraction of the two moist\r\nsurfaces in contact. But when we reflect that it requires the pressure\r\nof a mile of ice—135 tons on the square foot—to lower the melting-point\r\none degree, it must be obvious that the lowering effect resulting\r\nfrom capillary attraction in the case under consideration must be\r\ninfinitesimal indeed.\r\n\r\nThe following clear and concise account of Faraday’s theory, I quote\r\nfrom Professor Tyndall’s “Forms of Water:”—\r\n\r\n“Faraday concluded that _in the interior_ of any body, whether solid\r\nor liquid, where every particle is grasped, so to speak, by the\r\nsurrounding particles, and grasps them in turn, the bond of cohesion\r\nis so strong as to require a higher temperature to change the state\r\nof aggregation than is necessary _at the surface_. At the surface of\r\na piece of ice, for example, the molecules are free on one side from\r\nthe control of other molecules; and they therefore yield to heat more\r\nreadily than in the interior. The bubble of air or steam in overheated\r\nwater also frees the molecules on one side; hence the ebullition\r\nconsequent upon its introduction. Practically speaking, then, the\r\npoint of liquefaction of the interior ice is higher than that of the\r\nsuperficial ice....\r\n\r\n“When the surfaces of two pieces of ice, covered with a film of the\r\nwater of liquefaction, are brought together, the covering film is\r\ntransferred from the surface to the centre of the ice, where the point\r\nof liquefaction, as before shown, is higher than at the surface.\r\nThe special solidifying power of ice upon water is now brought\r\ninto play _on both sides of the film_. Under these circumstances,\r\nFaraday held that the film would congeal, and freeze the two surfaces\r\ntogether.”—_The Forms of Water_, p. 173.\r\n\r\nThe following appears to be a more simple explanation of the phenomena\r\nthan either of the preceding:—\r\n\r\nThe freezing-point of water, and the melting-point of ice, as Professor\r\nTyndall remarks, touch each other as it were at this temperature. At\r\na hair’s-breadth lower water freezes; at a hair’s-breadth higher ice\r\nmelts. Now if we wish, for example, to freeze water, already just about\r\nthe freezing-point, or to melt a piece of ice already just about the\r\nmelting-point, we can do this either by a change of temperature or\r\nby a change of the melting-point. But it will be always much easier\r\nto effect this by the former than by the latter means. Take the\r\ncase already referred to, of the two pieces of ice suspended in an\r\natmosphere above the melting-point. The pieces at their surfaces are\r\nin a melting condition, and are surrounded by a thin film of water\r\njust an infinitesimal degree above the freezing-point. The film has on\r\nthe one side solid ice at the freezing-point, and on the other a warm\r\natmosphere considerably above the freezing-point. The tendency of the\r\nice is to lower the temperature of the film, while that of the air is\r\nto raise its temperature. When the two pieces are brought into contact\r\nthe two films unite and form one film separating the two pieces of ice.\r\nThis film is not like the former in contact with ice on the one side\r\nand warm air on the other. It is surrounded on both sides by solid ice.\r\nThe tendency of the ice, of course, is to lower the film to the same\r\ntemperature as the ice itself, and thus to produce solidification.\r\nIt is evident that the film must either melt the ice or the ice must\r\nfreeze the film, if the two are to assume the same temperature. But the\r\npower of the ice to produce solidification, owing to its greater mass,\r\nis enormously greater than the power of the film to produce fluidity,\r\nconsequently regelation is the result.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 VII.\r\n\r\n  LIST OF PAPERS WHICH HAVE APPEARED IN DR. A. PETERMANN’S\r\n      _GEOGRAPHISCHE MITTHEILUNGEN_ RELATING TO THE GULF-STREAM AND\r\n      THERMAL CONDITION OF THE ARCTIC REGIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most important memoir which we have on the Gulf-stream and its\r\ninfluence on the climate of the arctic regions is the one by Dr. A.\r\nPetermann, entitled “Der Golfstrom und Standpunkt der thermometrischen\r\nKenntniss des nord-atlantischen Oceans und Landgebiets im Jahre 1870.”\r\n_Geographische Mittheilungen_, Band XVI. 1870.\r\n\r\nDr. Petermann has, in this memoir, by a different line of argument\r\nfrom that which I have pursued in this volume, shown in the most clear\r\nand convincing manner that the abnormally high temperature of the\r\nnorth-western shores of Europe and the seas around Spitzbergen is owing\r\nentirely to the Gulf-stream, and not to any general circulation such as\r\nthat advocated by Dr. Carpenter. From a series of no fewer than 100,000\r\nobservations of temperature in the North Atlantic and in the arctic\r\nseas, he has been enabled to trace with accuracy on his charts the very\r\nfootsteps of the heat in its passage from the Gulf of Mexico up to the\r\nshores of Spitzbergen.\r\n\r\nThe following is a list of the more important papers bearing on the\r\nsubject which have recently appeared in Dr. Petermann’s _Geogr.\r\nMittheilungen_:—\r\n\r\nAn English translation of Dr. Petermann’s Memoir, and of a few more in\r\nthe subjoined list, has been published in a volume, with supplements,\r\nby the Hydrographic Department of the United States, under the\r\nsuperintendence of Commodore R. H. Wyman.\r\n\r\nThe papers whose titles are in English have appeared in the American\r\nvolume. In that volume the principal English papers on the subject,\r\nin as far as they relate to the north-eastern extension of the\r\nGulf-stream, have also been reprinted.\r\n\r\nThe System of Oceanic Currents in the Circumpolar Basin of the Northern\r\nHemisphere.

Recently the laborious task of     |\r\n| re-investigating the whole subject of the secular variations of the  |\r\n| elements of the planetary orbits was undertaken by Mr. Stockwell,    |\r\n| of the United States. He has taken into account the disturbing       |\r\n| influence of the planet Neptune, the existence of which was not      |\r\n| known when Leverrier’s computations were made; and he finds that     |\r\n| the eccentricity of the earth’s orbit will always be included        |\r\n| within the limits of 0 and 0·0693888. Mr. Stockwell’s elaborate      |\r\n| Memoir, extending over no fewer than two hundred pages, will be      |\r\n| found in the eighteenth volume of the “Smithsonian Contributions to  |\r\n| Knowledge.”                                                          |\r\n|                                                                      |\r\n| [28] When the eccentricity is at its superior limit, the absolute    |\r\n| quantity of heat received by the earth during the year is, however,  |\r\n| about one three-hundredth part greater than at present.

Geog. Soc., vol. xviii., p.        |\r\n| 334) misapprehends me in supposing that I attribute the Gibraltar    |\r\n| current wholly to the Gulf-stream. In the very page from which he    |\r\n| derives or could derive his opinion as to my views on the subject    |\r\n| (Phil. Mag. for March, 1874, p. 182), I distinctly state that        |\r\n| “the excess of evaporation over that of precipitation within the     |\r\n| Mediterranean area would of itself produce a considerable current    |\r\n| through the Strait.” That the Gibraltar current is due to two        |\r\n| causes, (1) the pressure of the Gulf-stream, and (2) excess of       |\r\n| evaporation over precipitation in the Mediterranean, has always      |\r\n| appeared to me so perfectly obvious, that I never held nor could     |\r\n| have held any other opinion on the subject.                          |\r\n|                                                                      |\r\n| [97] Paper read to the Edinburgh Botanical Society on January 8,     |\r\n| 1874.                                                                |\r\n|                                                                      |\r\n| [98] Proc. Roy. Geog. Soc., vol. xviii., p. 362. A more              |\r\n| advantageous section might have been chosen, but this will suffice.  |\r\n| The section referred to is shown in Plate III. The peculiarity of    |\r\n| this section, as will be observed, is the thinness of the warm       |\r\n| strata at the equator, as compared with that of the heated water in  |\r\n| the North Atlantic.                                                  |\r\n|                                                                      |\r\n| [99] The temperature of column C in Dr. Carpenter’s section is       |\r\n| somewhat less than that given in the foregoing table; so that,       |\r\n| according to that section, the difference of level between column C  |\r\n| and columns A and B would be greater than my estimate.               |\r\n|                                                                      |\r\n| [100] Captain Nares’s Report, July 30, 1874.                         |\r\n|                                                                      |\r\n| [101] See Chapter IV.                                                |\r\n|                                                                      |\r\n| [102] Phil.

The action of the rivers      |\r\n| escaping from the melting ice has succeeded in obliterating all      |\r\n| trace of striæ. It is the same, he says, with the heaps of gravel    |\r\n| and sand in the lower grounds of Sweden and Norway, Scotland and     |\r\n| Ireland. These deposits are evidently in the first place merely the  |\r\n| materials carried down by the swollen rivers that issued from the    |\r\n| gradually melting ice-fields and glaciers. The stones of the gravel  |\r\n| derived from the demolition of moraines and till, have lost all      |\r\n| their striæ and become in most cases well water-worn and rounded.    |\r\n|                                                                      |\r\n| [138] Report on Icebergs, read before the Association of American    |\r\n| Geologists, _Silliman’s Journal_, vol. xliii., p. 163 (1842).        |\r\n|                                                                      |\r\n| [139] “Manual of Geology,” p. 677.                                   |\r\n|                                                                      |\r\n| [140] Quart.

Had it not been that  |\r\n| Mr. Tylor’s attention was directed to the effects produced by the    |\r\n| removal of sediment in raising the level of the ocean rather than    |\r\n| in lowering the level of the land, he could not have failed to       |\r\n| perceive that he was in possession of a key to unfold the mystery    |\r\n| of geological time.                                                  |\r\n|                                                                      |\r\n| [200] Proc.

The fact    |\r\n| is, however, overlooked, that the greater thickness of an ice-cap    |\r\n| at its centre is a physical necessity not depending on the rate of   |\r\n| snowfall. Supposing the snowfall to be greater at, say, lat. 70°     |\r\n| than at 80°, and greater at 80° than at the pole; nevertheless, the  |\r\n| ice will continue to accumulate till it is thicker at 80° than at    |\r\n| 70°, and at the pole than it is at 80°.                              |\r\n|                                                                      |\r\n| [213] It is a pity that at present no record is kept, either by      |\r\n| the Board of Trade or by the Admiralty, of remarkable icebergs       |\r\n| which may from time to time be met with. Such a record might be of   |\r\n| little importance to navigation, but it would certainly be of great  |\r\n| service to science.                                                  |\r\n|                                                                      |\r\n| [214] See Chapter XXVII., and also Geol.

Journ. of Science, October, 1874) state    |\r\n| that Leverrier has lately investigated the question as to the        |\r\n| extent of the variation of the plane of the ecliptic, and has        |\r\n| arrived at results differing considerably from those of Laplace;     |\r\n| viz., that the variation may amount to 4° 52′, whereas, according    |\r\n| to Laplace, it amounts to only 1° 21′. I fear they are comparing     |\r\n| things that are totally different; viz., the variation of the        |\r\n| plane of the ecliptic in relation to its mean position with its      |\r\n| variation in relation to the equator. Laplace estimated that the     |\r\n| plane of the ecliptic would oscillate to the extent of 4° 53′ 33″    |\r\n| on each side of its mean position, a result almost identical with    |\r\n| that of Leverrier, who makes it 4° 51′ 42″. But neither of these     |\r\n| geometricians ever imagined that the ecliptic could change in        |\r\n| relation to the equator to even one-third of that amount.            |\r\n|                                                                      |\r\n| Laplace demonstrated that the change in the plane of the ecliptic    |\r\n| affected the position of the equator, causing it to vary along with  |\r\n| it, so that the equator could never possibly recede further than     |\r\n| 1° 22′ 34″ from its mean position in relation to the ecliptic        |\r\n| (“_Mécanique Céleste_,” vol. ii., p. 856, Bowditch’s Translation;    |\r\n| see also Laplace’s memoir, “Sur les Variations de l’Obliquité de     |\r\n| l’Écliptique,” _Connaissance des Temps_ for 1827, p. 234), and I am  |\r\n| not aware that Leverrier has arrived at a different conclusion.      |\r\n|                                                                      |\r\n| [223] Memoir on the Secular Variations of the Elements of the        |\r\n| Orbits of the Planets, “Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge,”     |\r\n| vol. xvii.                                                           |\r\n|                                                                      |\r\n| [224] “Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge,” vol. ix.             |\r\n|                                                                      |\r\n| [225] “Distribution of Heat on the Surface of the Globe,” p. 14.     |\r\n|                                                                      |\r\n| [226] Chapter IV.                                                    |\r\n|                                                                      |\r\n| [227] Quart.

For example, the winter      |\r\n| solstice was in the aphelion about the following dates: 11,700,      |\r\n| 33,300, and 61,300 years ago. Here are two consecutive revolutions,  |\r\n| the one performed in 21,600 years and the other in 28,000 years;     |\r\n| the difference in the length of the two periods amounting to no      |\r\n| fewer than 6,400 years.                                              |\r\n|                                                                      |\r\n| [232] Quart.

Additional confirmation   |\r\n| has been derived from the important observations of Mr. D.           |\r\n| Mackintosh, and also of Mr. Goodchild, of the Geological Survey of   |\r\n| England.                                                             |\r\n|                                                                      |\r\n| [274] Trans.

The bottom of the    |\r\n| trough, be it observed, at the watershed at Kilsyth, is 300 feet     |\r\n| above the level of its bottom at Grangemouth; and this Mr. Milne     |\r\n| Home freely admits. But he has not explained how an iceberg, which   |\r\n| could float across the shallow water at Kilsyth, say, 100 feet       |\r\n| deep, could manage to grind the rocky bottom at Grangemouth, where   |\r\n| it was not less than 400 feet deep. “The impetus acquired in the     |\r\n| Kyle at Kilsyth,” says Mr. Milne Home, “would keep them moving on,   |\r\n| and the prevailing westerly winds would also aid, so that when       |\r\n| _grating_ on the subjacent carboniferous rocks they would not have   |\r\n| much difficulty in scooping out a channel both wider and deeper      |\r\n| than at Kilsyth.” But how could they “_grate_ on the subjacent       |\r\n| carboniferous rocks” at Grangemouth, if they managed to _float_      |\r\n| at Kilsyth? Surely an iceberg that could “_grate_” at Grangemouth    |\r\n| would “_ground_” at Kilsyth.                                         |\r\n|                                                                      |\r\n| [283] Trans. of the Geol.

I fear that Mr. Young and Mr. Milne Home have been          |\r\n| misinformed in regard to the existence of these dykes. About a mile  |\r\n| _above_ Bowling there are one or two dykes which approach to the     |\r\n| river-bank, and may probably cross, but these could not possibly     |\r\n| cut off a channel entering the Clyde at Bowling. In none of the      |\r\n| borings or excavations which have been made by the Clyde Trustees    |\r\n| has the rock been reached from Bowling downwards. I may also state   |\r\n| that the whole Midland valley, from the Forth of Clyde to the Firth  |\r\n| of Forth, has been surveyed by the officers of the Geological        |\r\n| Survey, and only a single dyke has been found to cross the buried    |\r\n| channels, viz., one (Basalt rock) running eastward from Kilsyth to   |\r\n| the canal bridge near Dullatur. But as this is not far from the      |\r\n| watershed between the two channels it cannot affect the question at  |\r\n| issue.

Tension would     |\r\n| tend to lower the temperature of the ice-molecules, and this         |\r\n| lowering of temperature would have the tendency of freezing them     |\r\n| more firmly together.

But the mean annual amount of heat    |\r\n| received cannot vary much more than one-tenth part of one per cent.  |\r\n| In short, the effect of eccentricity on the mean annual supply of    |\r\n| heat received from the sun, in so far as geological climate is       |\r\n| concerned, may be practically disregarded.—[J. C.]                   |\r\n|                                                                      |\r\n| [318] “Principles of Geology,” p. 110. “Mr. Lyell, however, in       |\r\n| stating the actual excess of eight days in the duration of the       |\r\n| sun’s presence in the northern hemisphere over that in the southern  |\r\n| as productive of an excess of light and heat annually received by    |\r\n| the one over the other hemisphere, appears to have misconceived the  |\r\n| effect of elliptic motion in the passage here cited, since it is     |\r\n| demonstrable that whatever be the ellipticity of the earth’s orbit   |\r\n| the two hemispheres must receive equal absolute quantities of light  |\r\n| and heat per annum, the proximity of the sun in perigee exactly      |\r\n| compensating the effect of its swifter motion. This follows from a   |\r\n| very simple theorem, which may be thus stated: ‘The amount of heat   |\r\n| received by the earth from the sun while describing any part of      |\r\n| its orbit is proportional to the angle described round the sun’s     |\r\n| centre,’ so that if the orbit be divided into two portions by a      |\r\n| line drawn _in any direction_ through the sun’s centre, the heats    |\r\n| received in describing the two unequal segments of the ellipse so    |\r\n| produced will be equal.”                                             |\r\n|                                                                      |\r\n| [319] When the eccentricity of the earth’s orbit is at its superior  |\r\n| limit, the absolute quantity of heat received by the globe during    |\r\n| one year will be increased by only 1/300th part; an amount which     |\r\n| could produce no sensible influence on climate.—[J. C.]              |\r\n|                                                                      |\r\n| [320] Sir Charles has recently, to a certain extent, adopted the     |\r\n| views advocated in the present volume, viz., that the cold of the    |\r\n| glacial epoch was brought about not by a _decrease_, but by an       |\r\n| _increase_ of eccentricity. (See vol. i. of “Principles,” tenth      |\r\n| and eleventh editions.) The decrease in the mean annual quantity     |\r\n| of heat received from the sun, resulting from the decrease in        |\r\n| the eccentricity of the earth’s orbit—the astronomical cause to      |\r\n| which he here refers—could have produced no sensible effect on       |\r\n| climate.—[J. C.]                                                     |\r\n|                                                                      |\r\n| [321] It is singular that both Arago and Humboldt should appear to   |\r\n| have been unaware of the researches of Lagrange on this subject.     |\r\n|                                                                      |\r\n| [322] “Révolutions de la Mer,” p. 37.
