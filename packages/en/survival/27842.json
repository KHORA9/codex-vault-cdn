Mainly within the last century has this\r\nknowledge been organized into the science of geology, and only within\r\nthe last few decades have the complex and increasing demands of modern\r\ncivilization required the applications of geology to practical uses,\r\nresulting in the development of the science generally known as _economic\r\ngeology_. This science is not sharply marked off from the science of\r\ngeology proper; almost any phase of geology may at some time or some\r\nplace take on its economic aspect.\r\n\r\nThe usefulness of economic geology was first recognized in relation to\r\nmineral resources,--and particularly in relation to metallic resources,\r\ntheir discovery and development,--but the science has been found to have\r\nmuch wider practical application. The practice of the economic geologist\r\nin recent years has taken on many new phases.\r\n\r\nThe geologist is called upon to study the geologic features of mineral\r\ndeposits, their occurrence, structure, and origin. The basic information\r\nthus acquired is useful in estimating reserves and life of mineral\r\ndeposits. This leads naturally to considerations of valuation. Because\r\nvaluation plays such a large part in any tax program, the geologist is\r\nbeing used by tax boards of the federal and state governments.\r\n\r\nBoth in the formulation of laws relating to mineral resources, and in\r\nthe litigation growing out of the infraction of these laws, the economic\r\ngeologist plays a part.\r\n\r\nOne cannot go very far with the study of mineral resources without\r\nconsideration of the question of conservation. Geologists are called on\r\nnot only for broad surveys of the mineral reserves, but for the\r\nformulation of general principles of conservation and their application\r\nto specific mines and minerals.\r\n\r\nThe geologist's familiarity with the distribution and nature of mineral\r\nresources has given him a part in coping with broad questions of\r\ninternational use of natural resources. War conditions made it necessary\r\nto use new sources of supply, new channels of distribution, and new\r\nmethods of utilization. The economic geologist came into touch with\r\nquestions of international trade, tariffs, and shipping.\r\n\r\nBut economic geology is not solely confined to mineral resources. In\r\nrelation to engineering enterprises of the greatest variety--canals,\r\naqueducts, tunnels, dams, building excavations, foundations,\r\netc.--geology now figures largely, both in war and in peace.\r\n\r\nThe nature, amount, and distribution of underground water supplies are\r\nso involved with geologic considerations that a considerable number of\r\ngeologists give up their time wholly to this phase of the subject.\r\n\r\nIt might seem from this list of activities that geology is spreading too\r\nfar into the fields of engineering and commerce, but there are equally\r\nrapid extensions of other fields of knowledge toward geology. The\r\norganization of these intermediate fields is required both in the\r\ninterest of science and in the interest of better adaptation of the race\r\nto its environment. The geologist is required to do his part in these\r\nnew fields, but not to abandon his traditional field.\r\n\r\nIt is proposed in this volume to discuss the economic aspects of geology\r\nwithout exhaustive discussion of the principles of geology which are\r\ninvolved. Practically the whole range of geologic science has some sort\r\nof economic application, and it would be futile to attempt in one volume\r\neven a survey of the science of geology as a whole. Our purpose is\r\nrather to indicate and illustrate, in some perspective, the general\r\nnature of the application of geology to practical affairs.\r\n\r\nIn professional preparation for the practice of economic geology there\r\nis no easy short-cut. Students sometimes think that a smattering of\r\ngeological principles, combined with a little business and economic\r\ninformation, may be sufficient. Analysis of professional successes\r\nshould make it clear that economic geologists are most effective and in\r\nmost demand, not primarily because of business aptitude, though this\r\nhelps, but because of their proficiency in the science of geology\r\nitself. In short, to enter successfully the field of economic geology\r\none should first become a scientist, if only in a limited field.\r\n\r\nThe traditional conception of the geologist as a musty and stooped\r\nindividual, with a bag, hammer, and magnifying glass, collecting\r\nspecimens to deposit in a dusty museum, will doubtless survive as a\r\ncaricature, but will hardly serve to identify the economic geologist in\r\nhis present-day work. In writing this book, it is hoped in some measure\r\nto convey an impression of the breadth and variety in this field. Few\r\nother sciences offer so wide a range of opportunity, from the purely\r\nscientific to the practical and commercial, coupled with travel,\r\nexploration, and even adventure.\r\n\r\n\r\nECONOMIC APPLICATIONS OF THE SEVERAL BRANCHES OF GEOLOGY AND OF OTHER\r\nSCIENCES\r\n\r\nThere is no phase of geology which at some time or place does not have\r\nits economic application. Many references to these applications are made\r\nin other chapters. It is proposed here to indicate briefly some of the\r\nphases of geologic science which are most necessary to the practice of\r\neconomic geology. The student in his preparation cannot afford to\r\neliminate any of them on the ground that they are merely \"scientific\" or\r\n\"academic\" or \"theoretical.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMINERALOGY AND PETROLOGY\r\n\r\nMineralogy, the study of minerals, and petrology, the study of rocks\r\n(aggregations of minerals), are of course elementary requisites in\r\npreparation. There must be familiarity with the principal minerals and\r\nrocks, and especially with the methods and processes of their\r\nidentification, with their nature, and with their origin. This involves\r\na study of their crystallography, chemical composition, physical\r\nqualities, and optical properties as studied with the microscope. In\r\nrecent years the microscopical study of polished and etched surfaces of\r\nores has proved a valuable tool.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRATIGRAPHY AND PALEONTOLOGY\r\n\r\nStratigraphy and paleontology are concerned with the sedimentary and\r\nlife history of the earth. The determination of the ages of the earth's\r\nstrata and of the conditions of their deposition is required in the\r\npractice of economic geology. For example, a detailed knowledge of the\r\nsuccession of rocks and their ages, as determined by fossils and other\r\nstratigraphic evidence, is vital to the interpretation of conditions in\r\nan oil or coal field, and to the successful exploration and development\r\nof its deposits. The success of certain paleontologists and\r\nstratigraphic specialists in oil exploration is an evidence of this\r\nsituation. Certain iron ores, phosphates, salts, potash, and other\r\nminerals, as well as many of the common rocks used for economic\r\npurposes, are found in sedimentary deposits, and require for their\r\nsuccessful exploration and development the application of stratigraphic\r\nand paleontologic knowledge.\r\n\r\nClosely related to stratigraphy (as well as to physiography, see pp.\r\n6-10) is the study of sedimentation,--_i. e._, the study of the\r\nphysical, chemical, climatic, and topographic conditions of the\r\ndeposition of sediments. This is coming to play an increasingly large\r\npart in geologic work, and is essential to the interpretation of many\r\nmineral deposits, particularly those in which stratigraphic and\r\nphysiographic questions are involved.\r\n\r\nStill another aspect of the problem of stratigraphy and sedimentation is\r\ncovered by the study of _paleogeography_, or the areal distribution of\r\nthe faunas and sediments of geologic periods caused by the alternating\r\nsubmergence and emergence of land areas. In the search for the treasures\r\nof sedimentary deposits, a knowledge of ancient geographies and of\r\nancient faunas makes it possible to eliminate certain regions from\r\nconsideration. From a study of the faunas of eastern Kansas and\r\nMissouri, and of those along the eastern part of the Rocky Mountains, it\r\nhas been inferred that a ridge must have extended across eastern Kansas\r\nduring early Pennsylvanian time,--a conclusion which is of considerable\r\neconomic importance in relation to oil exploration.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRUCTURAL GEOLOGY\r\n\r\nStructural geology is the study of the physical forms and relations of\r\nrocks which result mainly from deformation by earth forces. If rocks\r\nremained in their original forms the structural problem would be a\r\ncomparatively easy one, but usually they do not. Often they are faulted\r\nand folded and mashed to such an extent that it is difficult to go\r\nbehind the superposed structural features to the original conditions in\r\norder to work out the geologic history. Not only is structural study\r\nnecessary for the interpretation of geologic history, but it is often\r\nmore directly applicable to economic problems,--as when, for instance,\r\nore deposits have been formed in the cracks and joints of rocks, and the\r\nore deposits themselves have been faulted and folded. Water resources\r\nare often located in the cracks and other openings of rocks, and are\r\nlimited in their distribution and flow because of the complex attitude\r\nof deformed rocks. Oil and gas deposits often bear a well-defined\r\nrelation to structural features, the working out of which is almost\r\nessential to their discovery.\r\n\r\nIt is not desirable to stop with the merely descriptive aspects of\r\nstructural geology, as is so often done; for much light can be thrown on\r\nthe economic applications of this subject by consideration of the\r\nunderlying principles of mechanics,--involving the relations of earth\r\nstresses to rock structures. The mere field mapping and description of\r\nfaults and joints is useful, but in some cases it is necessary to go a\r\nstep further and to ascertain the mechanical conditions of their origin\r\nin order to interpret them clearly. If, for illustration, there are\r\nsuccessive groups of mineralized veins in a mining camp, the later ones\r\ncutting the earlier ones, these might be treated as separate structural\r\nunits. But if it can be shown that the several sets of veins have formed\r\nfrom a single movement, that there is no sharp genetic separation\r\nbetween the different sets and that they are a part of a single system,\r\nthis interpretation throws new light on exploration and development, and\r\neven on questions of ownership and extralateral rights (Chapter XVI).\r\n\r\n\r\nPHYSIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\nPhysiography is a phase of geology which investigates the surface\r\nfeatures of the earth. It has to do not only with the description and\r\nclassification of surface forms, present and past (physical geography or\r\ngeomorphology), but with the processes and history of their development.\r\nThe subject is closely related to geography, climatology, sedimentation,\r\nand hydrology. As one of the latest phases of geology to be organized\r\nand taught, its economic applications have been comparatively recent and\r\nare not yet widely recognized. Because of this fact its economic\r\napplications may be summarized at somewhat greater length than those of\r\nthe other branches of geology above mentioned, which are to be more or\r\nless taken for granted.\r\n\r\nThe central feature of physiography is the so-called erosion cycle or\r\ntopographic cycle. Erosion, acting through the agencies of wind, water,\r\nand ice, is constantly at work on the earth's surface; the eroded\r\nmaterials are in large part carried off by streams, ultimately to be\r\ndeposited in the ocean near the continental margins. The final result is\r\nthe reduction of the land surface to an approximate plain, called a\r\n_peneplain_, somewhere near sea level. Geological history shows that\r\nsuch peneplains are often elevated again with reference to sea level, by\r\nearth forces or by subsidence of the sea, when erosion again begins its\r\nwork,--first cutting narrow, steep gulches and valleys, and leaving\r\nbroad intervening uplands, in which condition the erosion surface is\r\ndescribed as that of _topographic youth_; then forming wider and more\r\nextensive valleys, leaving only points and ridges of the original\r\npeneplains, in which stage the surface is said to represent _topographic\r\nmaturity_; then rounding off and reducing the elevations, leaving few or\r\nnone of the original points on the peneplain, widening the valleys still\r\nfurther and tending to reduce the whole country to a nearly flat\r\nsurface, resulting in the condition of _topographic old age_. The final\r\nstage is again the peneplain. This cycle of events is called the\r\n_erosion cycle_ or _topographic cycle_. Uplift may begin again before\r\nthe surface is reduced to base level; in fact, there is a constant\r\noscillation and contest between erosion and relative uplift of the land\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nThe action of the erosion cycle on rocks of differing resistance to\r\nerosion and of diverse structure gives rise to the great variety of\r\nsurface forms. The physiographer sees these forms, not as heterogeneous\r\nunits, but as parts of a definite system and as stages in an orderly\r\nseries of events. He is able to see into the topographic conditions\r\nbeyond the range of immediate and direct observation. He is able to\r\ndetermine what these forms were in the past and to predict their\r\ncondition in the future. He is able to read from the topography the\r\nunderground structure which has determined that topography. A given\r\nstructure may in different stages of topographic development give quite\r\ndiverse topographic forms. In such a case it is important to realize\r\nthat the diversity is only superficial. On the other hand, a slight\r\nlocal divergence from the usual topographic forms in a given region may\r\nreflect a similar local divergence in the underground structure. Thus it\r\nis that an appreciation of the physiographic details may suggest\r\nimportant variations in the underground structure which would otherwise\r\npass undiscovered.\r\n\r\nMany mineral deposits owe their origin or enrichment to weathering and\r\nother related processes which are preliminary to erosion. These\r\nprocesses vary in intensity, distribution, and depth, with the stage of\r\nerosion, or in relation to the phase of the erosion cycle. They vary\r\nwith the climatic conditions which obtain on the erosion surface.\r\nMineral deposits are therefore often closely related to the topographic\r\nfeatures, present and past, in kind, shape, and distribution. A few\r\nillustrative cases follow.\r\n\r\nMany of the great copper deposits of the western United States owe their\r\nvalues to a secondary enrichment through the agency of waters working\r\ndown from the surface. When this fact of secondary enrichment was\r\ndiscovered, it was naturally assumed that the process was related to the\r\npresent erosion surface and to present climatic and hydrologic\r\nconditions. Certain inferences were drawn, therefore, as to depth and\r\ndistribution of the enriched ores. This conception, however, proved to\r\nbe too narrow; for evidences were found in many cases that the copper\r\ndeposits had been concentrated in previous erosion cycles, and therefore\r\nin relation to erosion surfaces, now partly buried, different from the\r\npresent surface. The importance of this knowledge from an exploring and\r\ndevelopment standpoint is clear. It has made it possible to find and\r\nfollow rich ores, far from the present erosion surface, which would\r\notherwise have been disclosed solely by chance. Studies of this kind in\r\nthe copper camps are yet so recent that much remains to be learned. The\r\neconomic geologist advising exploration and development in copper ores\r\nwho does not in the future take physiographic factors into account is\r\nlikely to go wrong in essential ways, as he has done in some cases in\r\nthe past.\r\n\r\nNot only is it necessary to relate the secondary enrichment of copper\r\ndeposits to the erosion surface, present or past, but by a study of the\r\nconditions it must be ascertained how closely erosion has followed after\r\nthe processes of enrichment. In some cases erosion has followed so\r\nslowly as to leave large zones of secondary enrichment. In other cases\r\nerosion has followed up so closely after the processes of secondary\r\nenrichment as to remove from the surface important parts of the\r\nsecondarily enriched deposits.\r\n\r\nThe iron ores of the Lake Superior region are the result of the action\r\nof waters from the surface on so-called iron formations or jaspers. Here\r\nagain it was at first supposed that the enrichment was related to the\r\npresent erosion surface; but upon further studies the fact was disclosed\r\nthat the concentration of the ores took place in the period between the\r\ndeposition of Keweenawan and Cambrian rocks, and thus a new light was\r\nthrown on the possibilities as to depth and distribution of the ores.\r\nThe old pre-Cambrian surface, with reference to which the concentration\r\ntook place, can be followed with some precision beneath the present\r\nsurface. This makes it possible to forecast a quite different depth and\r\ndistribution of the ores from that which might be inferred from present\r\nsurface conditions. Present surface conditions, of low relief,\r\nconsiderable humidity, and with the water table usually not more than\r\n100 feet from the surface, do not promise ore deposits at great depth.\r\nThe erosion which formed the old pre-Cambrian surface, however, started\r\non a country of great relief and semi-arid climate, conditions which\r\nfavored deep penetration of the surface waters which concentrated the\r\nores.\r\n\r\nThe iron ores of eastern Cuba are formed by the weathering of a\r\nserpentine rock on an elevated plateau of low relief, where the sluggish\r\nstreams are unable rapidly to carry off the products of weathering.\r\nWhere streams have cut into this plateau and where the plateau breaks\r\ndown with sharp slopes to the ocean, erosion has removed the products of\r\nweathering, and therefore the iron ore. An important element, then, in\r\niron ore exploration in this country is the location of regions of\r\nslight erosion in the serpentine area. One of the largest discoveries\r\nwas made purely on a topographic basis. It was inferred merely from a\r\nstudy of topography that a certain large unexplored area ought to carry\r\niron ore. Subsequent work in the thick and almost impenetrable jungle\r\ndisclosed it.\r\n\r\nBauxite deposits in several parts of the world require somewhat similar\r\nconditions of concentration, and a study of the physiographic features\r\nis an important factor in their location and interpretation.\r\n\r\nA physiographic problem of another sort is the determination of the\r\nconditions surrounding the origin of sedimentary ores. Certain mineral\r\ndeposits, like the \"Clinton\" iron ores, the copper ores in the \"Red\r\nBeds\" of southwestern United States and in the Mansfield slates of\r\nGermany, many salt deposits, and almost the entire group of placer\r\ndeposits of gold, tin, and other metals, are the result of\r\nsedimentation, from waters which derived their materials from the\r\nerosion of the land surface. It is sometimes possible from the study of\r\nthese deposits to discover the position and configuration of the shore\r\nline, the depth of water, and the probable continuity and extent of the\r\ndeposits. Similar questions are met in the study of coal and oil.\r\n\r\nThis general problem is one of the phases of geology which is now\r\nreceiving a large amount of attention, not only from the standpoint of\r\nore deposition, but from a broader geologic standpoint. In spite of the\r\nfact that sedimentary processes of great variety can be observed in\r\noperation today, it is yet extremely difficult to infer from a given\r\nsedimentary deposit the precise conditions which determined its\r\ndeposition and limited its distribution. For instance, sedimentary iron\r\nformations furnish a large part of the world's iron ore. The surface\r\ndistribution, the structure, the features of secondary enrichment, are\r\nall pretty well understood; likewise the general conditions of\r\nsedimentation are reasonably clear,--but the close interpretation of\r\nthese conditions, to enable us to predict the extent of one of these\r\ndeposits, or to explain its presence in one place and absence in\r\nanother, is in an early and sketchy stage.\r\n\r\nAn understanding of the principles and methods of physiography is also\r\nvital to an intelligent application of geology to water resources, to\r\nsoils, to dam and reservoir construction, and to a great variety of\r\nengineering undertakings, but as these subjects involve the application\r\nof many other phases of geology, they are considered in separate\r\nchapters. (Chapters V, VI, and XX.)\r\n\r\n\r\nROCK ALTERATIONS OR METAMORPHISM\r\n\r\nThis is one of the newer special phases of geology which for a long time\r\nwas regarded as the plaything of the petrographer or student of rocks.\r\nWith the systematic development of the subject, however, it was found\r\nthat the extremely numerous and complex alterations of rocks and\r\nminerals may be definitely grouped, and that they are controlled by\r\nbroad principles. It became apparent also that these principles apply\r\nboth to the economic and non-economic minerals and rocks,--in other\r\nwords, that the segregation of economic minerals is a mere incident in\r\npervasive cycles of the alterations which affect all rocks. Metamorphic\r\ngeology, therefore, for some geologists becomes a convenient approach to\r\nthe subject of economic geology. It has the great advantage that it\r\ntends to keep all minerals and all processes of ore deposition in proper\r\nperspective with relation to rocks and rock processes in general. It is\r\nnot argued that this is the only approach or that it is the best for all\r\npurposes. A brief account of this phase of geology is given in Chapter\r\nII.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPLICATION OF OTHER SCIENCES\r\n\r\nGeology is sometimes defined as the application of other sciences to the\r\nearth. Considered broadly, there is no phase of science which is not\r\ninvolved in economic geology. In other chapters in this book many\r\nreferences are made to applications of engineering, mathematics,\r\nphysics, chemistry, metallurgy, biology, and economics.\r\n\r\nAt different times and places the requirements for earth materials are\r\nquite different. In the Stone Age there was little use for metals; in\r\nlater ages the use of metals broadened. The multiplicity of demands of\r\nmodern civilization, the increasing knowledge of processes of\r\nmetallurgy, chemistry and physics, better transportation, better\r\norganization of commercial life, and many other factors, tend to bring\r\nnew earth materials into use,--and, therefore, into the field of\r\neconomic geology. A comparatively few years ago alumina, one of the most\r\ncommon and abundant substances of the earth's crust, was in no general\r\ndemand except for very limited use as an ornament. Little attention was\r\npaid to it by economic geologists as a commercial product; now, however,\r\naluminum is in great demand, and the raw materials which produce it have\r\nbecome the subjects of intensive study by economic geologists.\r\n\r\nIn short, economic geology includes the consideration of man in reaction\r\nto his physical environment. There are some earth materials and some\r\nconditions of the earth environment which do not yet come within the\r\nfield of economic geology. But so large a proportion of them do, that\r\nthe \"complete economic geologist\" should indeed be almost omniscient.\r\nWhen one considers what an insignificantly small portion of this field\r\ncan be covered by any individual, it is apparent that the title of\r\neconomic geologist implies no mastery of the entire field. There is yet\r\nno crowding.\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATMENT OF THE SUBJECT IN THIS VOLUME\r\n\r\nIn scope and manner of treatment this volume follows somewhat the\r\nwriter's presentation of the subject in university teaching. The purpose\r\nis to explain the nature of the economic demands for the science of\r\ngeology, and to discuss something of the philosophy of the finding and\r\nuse of raw materials.\r\n\r\nSomewhat generalized statistics are used as a means of gaining\r\nperspective. No effort has been made for detailed accuracy or for\r\ncompleteness. So far as possible the quantitative features are expressed\r\nin general proportions, and where specific figures are given they are\r\nmeant to indicate only such general proportions. The thought has been\r\nnot to be so specific that the figures would soon be out of date. All\r\nstandard statistical sources have been drawn on, but the principal\r\nsources have been the results of the various special investigations\r\ncalled out by the war, in which the writer had a part.\r\n\r\nOn the geologic side many sources have been drawn on outside of the\r\nwriter's own experience. For the most part, no specific references or\r\nacknowledgments are made, on the ground that the book aims to present\r\nthe general features which are now the more or less common knowledge of\r\neconomic geologists. To make the references really adequate for\r\nexhaustive study would not only burden the text, but would require a\r\nspecificity of treatment which it has been hoped to avoid.\r\n\r\nThe illustrative cases chosen for discussion are often taken from the\r\nwriter's field of experience. This field has been principally the Lake\r\nSuperior region, but has included also the principal mineral deposits of\r\nNorth America, Cuba, and limited areas in South America and Europe. Thus\r\nthe Lake Superior iron and copper region might seem to be brought\r\nforward more than is warranted by its scientific or economic importance.\r\nFor this, the writer offers no apology. An author's perspective is\r\nlargely determined by his background of training and experience, and a\r\nfrank recognition of this fact may aid in determining the weight to be\r\ngiven to his conclusions. It might even add to scientific efficiency if\r\neach writer were to confine his discussion almost solely to matters\r\nwithin his own range of observation and study.\r\n\r\nThe writer's indebtedness for information derived from the printed page\r\nand for personal discussion and advice is of wide range. He would\r\nexpress his warm appreciation of the friendly spirit of cooperation and\r\nadvice with which this effort has been aided--a spirit which he likes to\r\nthink is particularly characteristic of the profession of economic\r\ngeology. In particular he would acknowledge the efficient aid of Mr.\r\nJulian D. Conover in preparation and revision of the manuscript.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE COMMON ELEMENTS, MINERALS, AND ROCKS OF THE EARTH AND THEIR ORIGINS\r\n\r\n\r\nA list of the solid substances of the earth making up the so-called\r\nlithosphere (or rock sphere) in order of their abundance, does not at\r\nall correspond to a list made in order of commercial importance. Some of\r\nthe most valuable substances constitute such a small proportion of the\r\ntotal mass of the lithosphere that they hardly figure at all in a table\r\nof the common substances.\r\n\r\n\r\nRELATIVE ABUNDANCE OF THE PRINCIPAL ELEMENTS OF THE LITHOSPHERE\r\n\r\nWhen reduced to the simplest terms of elements the outer ten miles of\r\nthe lithosphere consists of:[1]\r\n\r\nPERCENTAGE OF PRINCIPAL ELEMENTS IN THE LITHOSPHERE\r\n\r\n  Oxygen                                   47.33\r\n  Silicon                                  27.74\r\n  Aluminum                                  7.85\r\n  Iron                                      4.50\r\n  Calcium                                   3.47\r\n  Magnesium                                 2.24\r\n  Sodium                                    2.46\r\n  Potassium                                 2.46\r\n                                           -----\r\n                                           98.05\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the elements exist in quantities of less than 1 per\r\ncent. None of these principal elements occur separately in nature and\r\nnone of them are mined as elements for economic purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\nRELATIVE ABUNDANCE OF THE PRINCIPAL MINERALS OF THE LITHOSPHERE\r\n\r\nMinerals exceptionally consist of single elements, but ordinarily are\r\ncombinations of two or more elements; for instance, quartz consists of a\r\nchemical combination of silicon and oxygen. The proportions of the\r\ncommon minerals in the outer ten miles of the lithosphere are in round\r\nnumbers as follows:\r\n\r\n  PERCENTAGE OF COMMON MINERALS IN LITHOSPHERE\r\n\r\n  Feldspar                                  49\r\n  Quartz                                    21\r\n  Augite, hornblende, and olivine           15\r\n  Mica                                       8\r\n  Magnetite                                  3\r\n  Titanite and ilmenite                      1\r\n  Kaolin, limonite, hematite, dolomite,\r\n    calcite, chlorite, etc.                  3\r\n                                           ---\r\n                                           100\r\n\r\nIn making up this table it is assumed that the rocks to a depth of ten\r\nmiles are about 95 per cent of igneous type, that is, crystallized from\r\nmolten magma, and about 5 per cent of sedimentary type, that is, formed\r\nfrom the weathering and erosion of igneous rocks or preexisting\r\nsediments, and deposited in beds or layers, either by water or by air\r\n(see pp. 16-17).\r\n\r\nMore reliable figures for the relative abundance of the minerals are\r\navailable for each of the two classes of rocks, igneous and sedimentary.\r\nThe igneous rocks contain minerals in about the following proportions:\r\n\r\n  PERCENTAGE OF COMMON MINERALS IN IGNEOUS ROCKS\r\n\r\n  Feldspar                                    50\r\n  Quartz                                      21\r\n  Augite, hornblende, olivine, etc.           17\r\n  Mica                                         8\r\n  Magnetite                                    3\r\n  Titanite and ilmenite                        1\r\n                                             ---\r\n                                             100\r\n\r\nThe sedimentary rocks contain minerals in about the following\r\nproportions:\r\n\r\n  PERCENTAGE OF COMMON MINERALS IN SEDIMENTARY ROCKS\r\n\r\n  Quartz                                          35\r\n  Feldspar                                        16\r\n  White mica                                      15\r\n  Kaolin (clay)                                    9\r\n  Dolomite                                         9\r\n  Chlorite                                         5\r\n  Calcite                                          4\r\n  Limonite                                         4\r\n  Gypsum, carbon, rutile, apatite, magnetite,\r\n    etc.                                           3\r\n                                                 ---\r\n                                                 100\r\n\r\nThe sedimentary rocks comprise three main divisions: (1) The muds and\r\nclays, with their altered equivalents, shale, slate, etc.; (2) the\r\nsands, with their altered equivalents, sandstone, quartzite,\r\nquartz-schist, etc.; (3) the marls, limestones, and dolomites, with\r\ntheir altered equivalents, marble, talc-schist, etc. For brevity these\r\ngroups are referred to respectively as shale, sandstone, and limestone.\r\nThe proportions of minerals in each of these groups of rocks are as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nPERCENTAGE OF COMMON MINERALS IN SHALE, SANDSTONE, AND LIMESTONE\r\n\r\n  -----------+----------+-----------+-----------\r\n             | Average  |  Average  |  Average\r\n             |  shale   | sandstone | limestone\r\n  -----------+----------+-----------+-----------\r\n  Quartz     |  31.91   |  69.76    |   3.71\r\n  Kaolin     |  10.00   |   7.98    |   1.03\r\n  White mica |  18.40   |           |\r\n  Chlorite   |   6.40   |   1.15    |\r\n  Limonite   |   4.75   |    .80    |\r\n  Dolomite   |   7.90   |   3.44    |  36.25[1]\r\n  Calcite    |          |   7.21    |  56.56\r\n  Gypsum     |   1.17   |    .12    |    .10\r\n  Feldspar   |  17.60   |   8.41    |   2.20\r\n  Magnetite  |          |    .58    |\r\n  Rutile     |    .66   |    .12    |    .06\r\n  Ilmenite   |          |    .25    |\r\n  Apatite    |    .40   |    .18    |    .09\r\n  Carbon     |    .81   |           |\r\n  -----------+----------+-----------+-----------\r\n  Total      | 100.00   | 100.00    | 100.00\r\n  -----------+----------+-----------+-----------\r\n  1: Includes small amount of FeCO_{3}.\r\n\r\nIn comparing the mineral composition of igneous and sedimentary rocks,\r\nit will be noted that the most abundant single mineral of the igneous\r\nrocks, and the most abundant mineral of the lithosphere as a whole, is\r\n_feldspar_; that next in order is _quartz_; and that third comes a group\r\nof dark green minerals typified by augite and hornblende, commonly\r\ncalled _ferro-magnesian silicates_ because they consist of iron and\r\nmagnesia, with other bases, in combination with silica. The sedimentary\r\nrocks, which are ultimately derived from the destruction of the igneous\r\nrocks, contrast with the igneous rocks mainly in their smaller\r\nproportions of feldspars and ferro-magnesian minerals, their higher\r\nproportions of quartz and white mica (sericite or muscovite), and their\r\ncontent of kaolin, dolomite, calcite, chlorite, limonite, etc., which\r\nare nearly absent from the unaltered igneous rocks. Evidently the\r\ndevelopment of sediments from igneous rocks has involved the destruction\r\nof much of the feldspars and ferro-magnesian silicates, and the building\r\nfrom the elements of these destroyed minerals of more quartz, white\r\nmica, clay, dolomite, calcite, chlorite and limonite. The composition of\r\nthe minerals of the sedimentary rocks is such as to indicate that the\r\nconstituents of the air and water have been added in important amounts\r\nto accomplish this change of mineral character. For instance, carbon\r\ndioxide of the atmosphere has been added to lime and magnesia of the\r\nigneous rocks to make calcite and dolomite, water has been added to some\r\nof the alumina and silica of the igneous rocks to make kaolin or clay,\r\nand both oxygen and water have been added to the iron of the igneous\r\nrocks to make limonite.\r\n\r\n\r\nRELATIVE ABUNDANCE OF THE PRINCIPAL ROCKS OF THE LITHOSPHERE\r\n\r\nJust as elements combine chemically to form minerals, so do minerals\r\ncombine mechanically, either loosely or compactly, to form rocks. For\r\ninstance, quartz is a mineral. An aggregation of quartz particles forms\r\nsand or sandstone or quartzite. Most rocks contain more than one kind of\r\nmineral.\r\n\r\nSedimentary rocks occupy considerable areas of the earth's surface, but\r\nthey are relatively superficial. It has been estimated that if spread\r\nevenly and continuously over the earth, which they are not, they would\r\nconstitute a shell scarcely a half mile thick.[2] Igneous rocks are\r\nrelatively more abundant deep below the surface. If the sediments be\r\nassumed to be limited to a volume equivalent to a half-mile shell, and\r\nthe remainder of the rocks be assumed to be igneous, it is evident that\r\nto a depth of ten miles 95 per cent of the rocks are igneous. Our actual\r\nobservation is confined to a shallow superficial zone in which sediments\r\nmake up at least half of all the rocks.\r\n\r\nIgneous rocks can be divided for convenience into two main types: (1)\r\ngranite and allied rocks, containing a good deal of silica and therefore\r\n_acid_ in a chemical sense, and (2) basalt and allied types, containing\r\nless silica and more lime, magnesia, iron, soda and potassa, and\r\ntherefore _basic_ in a chemical sense. The former are light-colored gray\r\nand pink rocks while the latter are dark-colored green and gray rocks.\r\nGranite and basalt as technically defined are very common igneous\r\nrocks,--so common that the names are sometimes used to classify igneous\r\nrocks in general into two great groups, the granitic and the basaltic.\r\nIt has been estimated that about 65 per cent of the igneous rocks are of\r\nthe granitic group and 35 per cent of the basaltic group.\r\n\r\nSedimentary rocks, as already indicated, consist principally of three\r\ngroups, which for convenience are named shale, sandstone, and limestone.\r\nIf we approximate the average composition of each group and the average\r\ncomposition of the igneous rocks from which they are ultimately derived,\r\nit can be calculated that sedimentary rocks must form in the proportions\r\nof 82 per cent shale, 12 per cent sandstone, and 6 per cent limestone.\r\nOnly this combination of the three sediments will yield an average\r\ncomposition comparable with that of the parent igneous rocks. As\r\nactually observed in the field the sandstones and limestones are in\r\nrelatively higher percentage than is here indicated, suggesting that\r\npart of the shales may have been deposited in deep seas where they\r\ncannot be observed, and that part may have been so changed or\r\nmetamorphosed that they are no longer recognized as shales.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOILS AND CLAYS\r\n\r\nWeathered and disintegrated rocks at the surface form soils and clays.\r\nNo estimate is made of abundance, but obviously the total volume of\r\nthese products is small as compared with the major classes of earth\r\nmaterials above noted, and in large part they may be included with these\r\nmajor classes.\r\n\r\n\r\nWATER (HYDROSPHERE)\r\n\r\nIt has been estimated that all the water of the earth, including the\r\nocean, surface waters, and underground waters, constitutes about 7 per\r\ncent of the volume of the earth to a depth of 10 miles.[3]\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPARISON OF LISTS OF MOST ABUNDANT ROCKS AND MINERALS WITH COMMERCIAL\r\nROCKS AND MINERALS\r\n\r\nOf the common rocks and minerals figuring as the more abundant materials\r\nof the earth's crust, only a few are prominently represented in the\r\ntables of mineral resources. Of these water and soils stand first.\r\nOthers are the common igneous and sedimentary rocks used for building\r\nand road materials. Missing from the lists of the most abundant minerals\r\nand rocks, are the greater part of the commercially important mineral\r\nresources--including such as coal, oil, gas, iron ore, copper, gold, and\r\nsilver,--implying that these mineral products, notwithstanding their\r\ngreat absolute bulk and commercial importance, occur in relatively\r\ninsignificant amounts as compared with the common rock minerals of the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ORIGIN OF COMMON ROCKS AND MINERALS\r\n\r\nThe common rocks and minerals develop in a general sequence, starting\r\nwith igneous processes, and passing through stages of weathering,\r\nerosion, sedimentary processes, and alterations beneath the surface. The\r\ncommercial minerals are incidental developments under the same\r\nprocesses.\r\n\r\n\r\nIGNEOUS PROCESSES\r\n\r\nThe earliest known rocks are largely igneous. Sedimentary rocks are\r\nformed from the breaking down of igneous rocks, and the origin of rocks\r\ntherefore starts with the formation of igneous rocks. Igneous rocks are\r\nformed by the cooling of molten rock material. The ultimate source of\r\nthis molten material does not here concern us. It may come from deep\r\nwithin the earth or from comparatively few miles down. It may include\r\npreexisting rock of any kind which has been locally fused within the\r\nearth. Wherever and however formed, its tendency is to travel upward\r\ntoward the surface. It may stop far below the surface and cool slowly,\r\nforming coarsely crystallized rocks of the granite and gabbro types.\r\nIgneous rocks so formed are called _plutonic_ intrusive rocks. Or the\r\nmolten mass may come well toward the surface and crystallize more\r\nrapidly into rocks of less coarse, and often porphyritic, textures. Such\r\nintrusive rocks are porphyries, diabases, etc. Or the molten mass may\r\nactually overflow at the surface or be thrown out from volcanoes with\r\nexplosive force. It then cools quickly and forms finely crystalline\r\nrocks of the rhyolite and basalt types. These are called effusives or\r\nextrusives, or lavas or volcanics, to distinguish them from intrusives\r\nformed below the surface. The intrusive masses may take various forms,\r\ncalled stocks, batholiths, laccoliths, sills, sheets and dikes,\r\ndefinitions and illustrations of which are given in any geological\r\ntextbook. The effusives or volcanics at the surface take the form of\r\nsheets, flows, tuffs, agglomerates, etc.\r\n\r\nSome of the igneous rocks are themselves \"mineral\" products, as for\r\ninstance building stones and road materials. Certain basic intrusive\r\nigneous rocks contain titaniferous magnetites or iron ores as original\r\nconstituents. Others carry diamonds as original constituents. Certain\r\nspecial varieties of igneous rocks, known as pegmatites, carry coarsely\r\ncrystallized mica and feldspar of commercial value, as well as a\r\nconsiderable variety of precious gems and other commercial minerals.\r\nPegmatites are closely related to igneous after-effects, discussed under\r\nthe next heading. As a whole, the mineral products formed directly in\r\nigneous rocks constitute a much less important class than mineral\r\nproducts formed in other ways, as described below.\r\n\r\n=Igneous after-effects.= The later stages in the formation of igneous\r\nrocks are frequently accompanied by the expulsion of hot waters and\r\ngases which carry with them mineral substances. These become deposited\r\nin openings in adjacent rocks, or replace them, or are deposited in\r\npreviously hardened portions of the parent igneous mass itself. They\r\nform \"contact-metamorphic\" and certain vein deposits. Pegmatites,\r\nreferred to above, are in a broad sense in this class of \"igneous\r\nafter-effects,\" in that they are late developments in igneous intrusions\r\nand often grade into veins clearly formed by aqueous or gaseous\r\nsolutions. Among the valuable minerals of the igneous after-effect class\r\nare ores of gold, silver, copper, iron, antimony, mercury, zinc, lead,\r\nand others. While mineral products of much value have this origin, most\r\nof them have needed enrichment by weathering to give them the value they\r\nnow have.\r\n\r\n\r\nWEATHERING OF IGNEOUS ROCKS AND VEINS\r\n\r\nNo sooner do igneous rocks appear at or near the earth's surface, either\r\nby extrusion or as a result of removal by erosion of the overlying\r\ncover, than they are attacked vigorously by the gases and waters of the\r\natmosphere and hydrosphere as well as by various organisms,--with\r\nmaximum effect at the surface, but with notable effects extending as far\r\ndown as these agents penetrate. The effectiveness of these agents is\r\nalso governed by the climatic and topographic conditions. Under\r\nconditions of extreme cold or extreme aridity, weathering takes the form\r\nmainly of mechanical disintegration, and chemical change is less\r\nconspicuous. Under ordinary conditions, however, processes of chemical\r\ndecomposition are very apparent. The result is definitely known. The\r\nrocks become softened, loose, and incoherent. Voids and openings appear.\r\nThe volume tends to increase, if all end products are taken into\r\naccount. The original minerals, largely feldspar, ferro-magnesian\r\nminerals, and quartz, become changed to clay, mixed with quartz or sand,\r\ncalcite or dolomite, and iron oxide, together with residual particles of\r\nthe original feldspars and ferro-magnesian minerals which have only\r\npartly decomposed. In terms of elements or chemical composition, water,\r\noxygen, and carbon dioxide, all common constituents of the atmosphere\r\nand hydrosphere, have been added; and certain substances such as soda,\r\npotassa, lime, magnesia, and silica have in part been carried away by\r\ncirculating waters, to be redeposited elsewhere as sediments, vein\r\nfillings, and cements. Figure 1 illustrates the actual mineral and\r\nvolume changes in the weathering of a granite--one of the most common\r\nrocks. The minerals anorthite, albite, and orthoclase named in this\r\nfigure are all feldspars; sylvite and halite are chlorides of potash\r\nand soda. The weathering processes tend to destroy the original\r\nminerals, textures, and chemical composition. They are collectively\r\nknown as _katamorphic_ alterations, meaning destructive changes. The\r\nzone in which these changes are at a maximum is called the _zone of\r\nweathering_. This general zone is principally above the surface or level\r\nof the ground-waters, but for some rocks it extends well below this\r\nlevel. In some regions the ground-water level may be nearly at the\r\nsurface, and in others, especially where arid, it may be two thousand or\r\nmore feet down. Disintegrated weathered rocks form a blanket of variable\r\nthickness, which is sometimes spoken of as the residual mantle, or\r\n\"mantle rock.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1. Graphic representation of volume change\r\nin weathering of a Georgia granite.]\r\n\r\nMineral products formed by weathering from common igneous rocks include\r\nsoils, clay, bauxite, and certain iron, chromite, and nickel ores. Again\r\nthe commercial importance of this group is not large, as compared with\r\nproducts formed in other ways described below.\r\n\r\nThe same weathering processes described above for igneous rocks cause\r\nconsiderable changes of economic significance in deposits formed as\r\nigneous after-effects. In some cases they result in removing the less\r\nvaluable minerals, thus concentrating the more valuable ones, as well as\r\nin softening the rock and making it easier to work; and in other cases\r\nthey tend to remove the valuable constituents, which may then be\r\nredeposited directly below or may be carried completely out of the\r\nvicinity. The _oxide zones_ of many ore bodies are formed by these\r\nprocesses.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEDIMENTARY PROCESSES\r\n\r\nSedimentary rocks are formed by the removal and deposition of the\r\nweathered products of a land surface. Air, water, and ice, moving under\r\nthe influence of gravity and other forces, all aid in this transfer. The\r\nbroken or altered rock materials may be merely moved down slopes a\r\nlittle way and redeposited on the surface, forming one type of\r\n_terrestrial_ or _subaerial deposits_, or they may be transferred and\r\nsorted by streams. When deposited in streams or near their mouths, they\r\nare known as _river_, _alluvial_, or _delta deposits_. When carried to\r\nlakes and deposited they form _lake deposits_. Ultimately the greater\r\npart of them are likely to be carried to the ocean and deposited as\r\n_marine sediments_.\r\n\r\nPart of the weathered substances are carried mechanically as clay and\r\nsand, which go to make up the _shale_ and _sandstone_ sediments. Part\r\nare carried in solution, as for example lime carbonate and magnesium\r\ncarbonate, which go to make up _limestone_ and _dolomite_. Some of the\r\ndissolved substances are never redeposited, but remain in solution as\r\nsalts in the sea, the most abundant of which is sodium chloride. Some of\r\nthe dissolved substances of weathering, such as calcite, quartz, and\r\niron oxide, are carried down and deposited in openings of the rocks,\r\nwhere they act as cements.\r\n\r\nThe sediments as a whole consist of three main types,--_shales_ (kaolin,\r\nquartz, etc.), _sandstones_ (quartz, feldspar, etc.), and _limestones_\r\nor _dolomites_ (carbonates of lime and magnesia). Of these, the shale\r\ngroup is by far the most abundant. There are of course many sediments\r\nwith composition intermediate between these types. There are also\r\nsediments made up of large undecomposed fragments of the original rocks,\r\ncemented to form _conglomerates_, or made up of small fragments of the\r\noriginal rocks cemented to form _arkoses_ and _graywackes_. These,\r\nhowever, may be regarded as simply stages in the alteration, which in\r\nrepeated cycles of weathering must ultimately result in producing the\r\nthree main groups,--shales, sandstones, and limestones.\r\n\r\nMineral products formed by sedimentary processes include sandstones,\r\nlimestones, and shales, used as building stone and road materials;\r\ncertain sedimentary deposits of iron, like the Clinton ores of the\r\nsoutheastern United States and the Brazilian ores; important phosphate\r\ndeposits; most deposits of salt, gypsum, potash, nitrates, etc.;\r\ncomparatively few and unimportant copper deposits; and important placer\r\ndeposits of gold, tin, and other metals, and precious stones. With the\r\naid of organic agencies, sedimentary processes also account for the\r\nprimary deposition of coal and oil.\r\n\r\n\r\nWEATHERING OF SEDIMENTARY ROCKS\r\n\r\nAfter sedimentary rocks are formed, and in many cases covered by later\r\nsediments, they may be brought again by earth movements and erosion to\r\nthe surface, where they in turn are weathered. The weathering of\r\nsedimentary rocks proceeds along lines already indicated for the igneous\r\nrocks. Residual mantles of impure clay and sand are commonly formed.\r\nThe mineral composition of sedimentary rocks being different from that\r\nof igneous rocks to start with, the resulting products are in slightly\r\ndifferent proportions; but the changes are the same in kind and tend\r\nmerely to carry the general process of alteration farther in the same\r\ndirection,--that is, toward the production of a few substances like\r\nclay, quartz, iron oxide, and calcite, which are transported and\r\nredeposited to form clay, sand, and limestone. Cycles of this kind may\r\nbe repeated indefinitely.\r\n\r\nBy weathering of sedimentary rocks are produced some soils, certain\r\ncommercial clays, iron ores, lead and zinc ores, and other valuable\r\nmineral products.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSOLIDATION, CEMENTATION, AND OTHER SUBSURFACE ALTERATIONS OF ROCKS.\r\n\r\n=Cementation.= No sooner are residual weathered mantles formed or\r\nsedimentary rocks deposited, whether under air or water, than processes\r\nof consolidation begin. Settling, infiltration of cementing materials,\r\nand new growths, or recrystallization, of the original minerals of the\r\nrock all play a part in the process. The mud or clay becomes a shale,\r\nthe sand becomes sandstone or quartzite, the marl becomes limestone or\r\nmarble. All the minute openings between the grains, as well as larger\r\nopenings such as fissures and joints, may thus be filled. At the same\r\ntime the cementing materials may replace some of the original minerals\r\nof the rock, the new minerals either preserving or destroying the\r\noriginal textures. This process is sometimes called _metasomatic\r\nreplacement_. Igneous rocks as a rule are compact, and hence are not so\r\nmuch subject to the processes of cementation as sedimentary rocks; but\r\ncertain of the more porous phases of the surface lavas, as well as any\r\njoints in igneous rocks, may become cemented. All of these changes may\r\nbe grouped under the general term _cementation_.\r\n\r\nA special phase of consolidation and cementation is produced near\r\nintrusive igneous rocks through the action of the heat and pressure and\r\nthe expelled substances of the igneous rock. This is called _contact\r\nmetamorphism_ or _thermal metamorphism_. The processes are even more\r\neffective when acting in connection with the more intense metamorphism\r\ndescribed under the next heading.\r\n\r\nBy cementation some of the common rocks, especially the sediments,\r\nbecome sufficiently compact and strong to be useful as commercial\r\nproducts, such as building stones and road materials.\r\n\r\nMore important as mineral products are the cementing materials\r\nthemselves. These are commonly quartz, calcite, or iron oxide, of no\r\nespecial value, but locally they include commercially valuable minerals\r\ncontaining gold, copper, silver, lead, zinc, and many other mineral\r\nproducts.\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of simple and direct observation, about which there is no\r\ncontroversy, that many minerals are deposited as cements in the openings\r\nin rocks or replacing rocks. As to the source of the solutions bringing\r\nin these minerals, on the other hand, there has been much disagreement.\r\nIn general, the common cementing materials such as quartz and calcite,\r\nas well as some of the commercial minerals, are clearly formed as\r\nby-products of weathering, and are transported and redeposited by the\r\nwaters penetrating downward from the surface. The so-called _secondary\r\nenrichment_ of many valuable veins is merely one of the special phases\r\nof cementation from a superficial source. In other cases it is believed\r\nthat deep circulation of ordinary ground-waters may pick up dispersed\r\nmineral substances through a considerable zone, and redeposit them in\r\nconcentrated form in veins and other trunk channels. For still other\r\ncementing materials, it is suspected that the ultimate source is in\r\nigneous intrusions; in fact, deposits of this general character show all\r\ngradations from those clearly formed by surface waters, independently of\r\nigneous activity, to those of a contact-metamorphic nature and others\r\nbelonging under the head of \"igneous after-effects.\"\r\n\r\nHypothesis and inference play a considerable part in arriving at any\r\nconclusion as to the source of cementing materials,--with the result\r\nthat there is often wide latitude for difference of opinion and of\r\nemphasis on the relative importance of the different sources of ore\r\nminerals.\r\n\r\n=Dynamic and contact metamorphism.= Beneath the surface rocks are not\r\nonly cemented, but may be deformed or mashed by dynamic movements caused\r\nby great earth stresses; the rocks may undergo rock flowage. The result\r\nis often a remarkable transformation of the character of the rocks,\r\nmaking it difficult to recognize their original nature. Also, igneous\r\nintrusions may crowd and mash the adjacent rocks, at the same time\r\nchanging them by heat and contributions of new materials. This process\r\nmay be called _contact metamorphism_, but in so far as it results in\r\nmashing of the rocks it is closely allied to _dynamic metamorphism_. The\r\nformer term is also applied to less profound changes in connection with\r\nigneous intrusions, which result merely in cementation without mashing.\r\n\r\nDynamic and contact metamorphism may in some cases produce rocks\r\nidentical in appearance with those produced by ordinary processes of\r\ncementation and recrystallization without movement. For instance, it is\r\ndifficult to tell how much movement there has been in the production of\r\na marble, because both kinds of processes seem to produce much the same\r\nresult. Commonly, however, the effect of dynamic metamorphism is to\r\nproduce a parallel arrangement of mineral particles and to segregate the\r\nmineral particles of like kind into bands, giving a _foliated_ or\r\n_schistose_ or _gneissic_ structure, and the rocks then become known as\r\nslates, schists, or gneisses. Commonly they possess a capacity to part\r\nalong parallel surfaces, called _cleavage_. The development of the\r\nschistose or gneissic structure is accompanied by the recrystallization\r\nof the rock materials, producing new minerals of a platy or columnar\r\ntype adapted to this parallel arrangement. Even the composition of the\r\nrock may be substantially changed, though this is perhaps not the most\r\ncommon case. Whereas by weathering the rock is loosened up and\r\ndisintegrated, substances like carbon dioxide, oxygen, and water are\r\nabundantly added, and light minerals of simple composition tend to\r\ndevelop,--by dynamic metamorphism on the other hand, carbon dioxide,\r\noxygen, and water are usually expelled, the minerals are combined to\r\nmake heavier and more complex minerals, pore space is eliminated, and\r\naltogether the rock becomes much more dense and crystalline. While\r\nsegregation of materials is characteristic of the surficial products of\r\nweathering, the opposite tendency, of mixing and aggregation, is the\r\nrule under dynamic metamorphism, notwithstanding the minor segregation\r\nabove noted.\r\n\r\nDynamic metamorphism is for the most part unfavorable to the development\r\nof mineral products. Ore bodies brought into a zone where these\r\nprocesses are active may be profoundly modified, but not ordinarily\r\nenriched. One of the exceptions to this general rule is the development\r\nof the cleavage of a slate, which enables it to be readily split and\r\nthereby gives it value. Contact metamorphism, on the other hand, may\r\ndevelop valuable mineral deposits (see pp. 20, 45-46).\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE METAMORPHIC CYCLE AS AN AID IN STUDYING MINERAL DEPOSITS\r\n\r\nAll of the chemical, mineralogical, and textural changes in rocks above\r\ndescribed may be collectively referred to as _metamorphism_. The phase\r\nof metamorphism dealing with surficial weathering, similar changes below\r\nthe surface, and the formation of sediments, is called _katamorphism_ or\r\ndestructive change. The phase of metamorphism dealing with the\r\nconstructive changes in rocks, due to cementation, dynamic movements,\r\nand igneous influences, is called _anamorphism_. Some geologists confine\r\nthe term metamorphism to the changes involved in contact and dynamic\r\nmetamorphism, and call the resulting products _metamorphic rocks_.\r\n\r\nThe zone in which katamorphism is most active, usually near the surface,\r\nis called the _zone of katamorphism_. The deeper zone in which\r\nanamorphism is preponderant is called the _zone of anamorphism_. There\r\nare no definite limits of depth to these zones. A given rock may be\r\nundergoing katamorphism while rocks on either side at the same depth are\r\nsuffering anamorphism.\r\n\r\nBy katamorphism rocks break down to produce the surficial rocks, and by\r\nanamorphism the surficial rocks are again consolidated and altered to\r\nproduce highly crystalline rocks, which are not dissimilar in many of\r\ntheir characteristics to the igneous rocks from which all rocks trace\r\ntheir ultimate origin. In other words, anamorphism tends toward the\r\nreproduction of igneous rocks, though it seldom fully accomplishes this\r\nresult. These two main groups of changes together constitute the\r\n_metamorphic cycle_. Some rocks go through all phases of the cycle, but\r\nothers may pass directly from one phase to an advanced phase without\r\ngoing through the intermediate stages. For instance, an igneous rock may\r\nbecome a schist without going through the intermediate stage of\r\nsedimentation.\r\n\r\nRocks are not permanent in their condition, but at practically all times\r\nand places are undergoing some kind of metamorphism which tends to adapt\r\nthem to their environment. The conception of rocks as representing\r\nphases or stages in a progressive series of changes called the\r\nmetamorphic cycle aids greatly in correlating and holding in mind many\r\ndetails of rock nature and origin, and brings into some sort of\r\nperspective the conditions which have produced rocks. A schistose\r\nsediment comes to be regarded as an end product of a long series of\r\nalterations, beginning with igneous rocks and passing through the stages\r\nof weathering, sedimentation, cementation, etc., each of which stages\r\nhas been responsible for certain mineralogical, chemical, and textural\r\nfeatures now characterizing the rock. The alternation of constructive\r\nand destructive changes of the metamorphic cycle, and the repetitions of\r\nthe cycle itself, periodically work over the earth materials into new\r\nforms. Usually the cycles are not complete, in the sense that they\r\nseldom bring the rock back to exactly the same condition from which it\r\nstarted. More sediments are formed than are changed to schists and\r\ngneisses, and more schists and gneisses are formed than are changed back\r\nto igneous rocks. Salts in the ocean continuously accumulate. The net\r\nresult of the metamorphic cycle, is, therefore, the accumulation of\r\nmaterials of the same kinds. Incidental to these accumulations is the\r\nsegregation of commercial mineral products.\r\n\r\nThe metamorphic cycle becomes a logical and convenient geologic basis\r\nfor correlating, interpreting, and classifying mineral products. Because\r\nof the great variety of materials and conditions represented in mineral\r\ndeposits, prodigious efforts are required to remember them as\r\nindependent entities; but as incidents or stages in the well-known\r\nprogress of the metamorphic cycle, their essential characteristics may\r\nbe easily remembered and kept in some perspective.\r\n\r\nOres of certain metals, such as iron, occur in almost every phase of the\r\nmetamorphic cycle,--as igneous after-effects, as weathered products, as\r\nsediments, and as schists. The ores of each of these several phases have\r\ngroup characteristics which serve to distinguish them in important\r\nparticulars from ores belonging to other phases of the cycle. Having\r\nestablished the position of any particular ore in the metamorphic cycle,\r\na number of safe inferences are possible as to mineralogical\r\ncomposition, shape, extent, and other conditions, knowledge of which is\r\nnecessary for an estimate of commercial possibilities.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Clarke, F.

Each of these classifications is\r\nuseful for some purposes. The geologist usually prefers a classification\r\nbased on origin or genesis. In the following chapters on mineral\r\nresources, however, such a classification is not the primary one,\r\nbecause of the desire to emphasize economic features. The mineral\r\ncommodities are treated as units and by group uses. Some mineral\r\ncommodities have so many different kinds of origin in different regions\r\nthat to distribute them among several genetic groups in description\r\nwould make it impossible to preserve the unity necessary for\r\nconsideration of the economic features.\r\n\r\nWhile in the descriptive chapters many references are made to origin, it\r\nmay be difficult for the reader to assemble them in perspective; for\r\nthis reason we summarize at the outset some of the salient features of\r\norigin of mineral deposits and of their geologic classification.\r\n\r\nTo the layman the reason for emphasis on origin is often not clear. The\r\n\"practical\" man frequently regards this phase of the subject as merely\r\nincidental to the immediate economic questions--a playground for\r\nharmless theorists. The answer of the economic geologist is that in no\r\nother way than by a knowledge of origin is it possible to arrive at an\r\nunderstanding of conditions which so well enables one to answer many\r\npractical questions. In the exploration for mineral deposits, it is\r\nobvious that an understanding of the kinds of geologic conditions and\r\nprocesses under which a given type of deposit is known to develop\r\nresults in the elimination of much unpromising territory, and the\r\nconcentration of work on favorable localities. In forming any estimate\r\nof mineral deposits beyond the ground immediately opened up,--for\r\ninstance, in estimating depth, form, change in values, mineralogical\r\ncharacter, or interruptions due to faulting,--it is difficult to form\r\nany intelligent conception of the probabilities unless the history of\r\nthe deposit is understood. If, for instance, the ore is known to be\r\nformed by hot waters, associated with the cooling of igneous rocks,\r\ndifferent conditions are to be expected below the zone of observation\r\nthan if the ore is formed by surface waters. If the ore body is formed\r\nas a single episode under simple geologic conditions, the interpretation\r\nof the possibilities in the situation may be quite different from the\r\ninterpretation applied where the history has been more complex. If the\r\nsurface conditions suggest possibilities of secondary enrichment of the\r\nores, the interpretation of the conditions underground will be different\r\nfrom those applied where there is no evidence of such enrichment.\r\n\r\nWhere a mineral deposit is completely opened up in three dimensions, it\r\nis often possible to work out economic questions of tonnage, grade,\r\nshape, and values, without the aid of geology. Also, where conditions\r\nare comparatively simple and uniform throughout a district, the local\r\nknowledge of other mines may be a sufficient basis for answering these\r\nquestions for any new property developed. Empirical methods may suffice.\r\nHowever, it is seldom that the conditions are so simple that some\r\ngeological inference is not necessary. Even where problems are settled\r\nwithout calling in the geologist, geological inferences are required in\r\nthe interpretation of, and projection from, the known facts. It is often\r\nthe case that the practical man has in his mind a rather elaborate\r\nassortment of geologic hypotheses, based on his individual experience,\r\nwhich make the so-called theories of the geologist seem conservative in\r\ncomparison. The geologist comes to the particular problem with a\r\nbackground of established geologic principles and observations, and his\r\nfirst thought is to ascertain all the local conditions which will aid in\r\ndeciphering the complete history of the mineral deposit. There is no\r\nfact bearing on the history, however remote from practical questions,\r\nwhich may not be potentially valuable.\r\n\r\nWith this digression to explain the geologist's emphasis on origin of\r\nmineral products, we may return to a consideration of a few of the\r\nprinciples of rock and mineral genesis which have been found to be\r\nsignificant in the study of mineral products.\r\n\r\nIn the preceding chapters it has been indicated that mineral deposits\r\nare mere incidents in the mass of common rocks; that they are made by\r\nthe same processes which make common rocks, that none of the processes\r\naffecting mineral deposits are unique for these minerals, and that most\r\ncommon rocks are on occasion themselves used as mineral resources. These\r\nfacts are emphasized in order to make it clear that the study of mineral\r\ndeposits cannot be dissociated from the study of rocks, and that the\r\nstudy of the latter is essential to bring mineral deposits into their\r\nproper perspective. Absorption in the details of a mineral deposit makes\r\nit easy for the investigator to forget or minimize these relations.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, in the study of mineral deposits, and especially deposits\r\nof the metallic minerals, certain geologic features stand out\r\nconspicuously against the common background indicated above. Our\r\ndiscussion of these features will follow the order of rock genesis\r\nindicated in the description of the metamorphic cycle.\r\n\r\n\r\nNAMES\r\n\r\nAny classification of mineral deposits on the basis of origin is more or\r\nless arbitrary. The sharp lines implied by the use of class names do not\r\nexist in nature. Mineral deposits are so complex and so interrelated in\r\norigin, that a classification according to genesis indicates only the\r\nessential and central class features; it does not sharply define the\r\nlimits of the classes.\r\n\r\nIt is practically impossible for any geologist to present a\r\nclassification which will be accepted without qualification by other\r\ngeologists, although there may be agreement on essential features.\r\nDifficulties in reaching agreement are increased by the inheritance from\r\nthe past of names, definitions, and classifications which do not exactly\r\nfit present conceptions based on fuller information,--but which,\r\nnevertheless, have become so firmly established in the literature that\r\nit is difficult to avoid their use. In the progress of investigation\r\nmany new names are coined to fit more precisely the particular situation\r\nin hand, but only in fortunate cases do these new names stand up against\r\nthe traditional currency and authority of old names. The geologist is\r\noften in despair in his attempt to express his ideas clearly and\r\nprecisely, and at the same time to use terms which will be\r\nunderstandable by his readers and will not arouse needless controversy.\r\n\r\nAs illustrative of the above remarks reference may be made to a few\r\nterms commonly used in economic geology, such as _primary_, _secondary_,\r\n_syngenetic_, _epigenetic_, _supergene_, _hypogene_, _protore_, etc.\r\n\r\nThe most commonly used of these terms are _primary_ and _secondary_. It\r\nis almost impossible to define them in a way which will cover all the\r\nconceptions for which they have been used, and yet in their context they\r\nhave been very useful in conveying essential ideas. An ore formed by\r\ndirect processes of sedimentation has sometimes been called primary,\r\nwhereas an ore formed by later enrichment of these sediments has been\r\ncalled secondary. An ore formed directly by igneous processes has been\r\ncalled primary, while an ore formed by enrichment of such primary ore by\r\nlater processes has been called secondary. It is clear, however, that\r\nthese terms are merely relative, with application to a specific\r\nsequence, and that they do not fix the absolute position of the ore in a\r\nsequence applying to all ores. For instance, ores deposited directly as\r\nsediments or placers may be derived from the erosion of preexisting ore\r\nbodies,--in which case it may sometimes be convenient to refer to the\r\nsedimentary ores or placers as secondary and the earlier ores as\r\nprimary. Or a sulphide deposit originating through igneous agencies may\r\nundergo two or three successive enrichments, each successive one\r\nsecondary to the preceding, but primary to the one following. In spite\r\nof these obvious difficulties, the terms primary and secondary may be\r\nentirely intelligible as indicating relative order of development under\r\na given set of conditions.\r\n\r\nThe term _syngenetic_ has been used for mineral deposits formed by\r\nprocesses similar to those which have formed the enclosing rocks and in\r\ngeneral simultaneously with them, and _epigenetic_ for those introduced\r\ninto preexisting rocks. In certain cases _syngenetic_ may be roughly\r\nsynonymous with _primary_, and _epigenetic_ with _secondary_, and yet a\r\nprimary ore may be epigenetic. For instance, zinc sulphides in the\r\nMississippi valley limestones (pp. 54-55) are epigenetic, and yet are\r\nprimary with reference to a later enrichment. The two sets of terms are\r\nmeant to convey somewhat different ideas and are not interchangeable.\r\n\r\nRansome[4] has suggested, especially for vein and contact deposits, a\r\nseries of names which has the considerable advantage of\r\ndefiniteness:--_hypogene ores_, formed in general by ascending\r\nnon-oxidizing solutions, perhaps hot; _supergene ores_, formed in\r\ngeneral by oxidizing and surface solutions, initially cold and downward\r\nmoving; and _protores_, or metallized rock or vein substances which are\r\ntoo low in tenor to be classed as ores, but which would have been\r\nconverted into ores had the enriching process been carried far enough.\r\nIn this connection Ransome defines primary ore as unenriched material\r\nthat can be profitably mined. In view of the general use of the terms\r\nprimary and secondary as expressing a sequential relation of ore\r\ndevelopment, it is doubtful whether this more precise definition will\r\nsupersede the older usage. Also it may be noted that commercial\r\nconditions might require, under these definitions, the designation of an\r\nore as a protore at one time or place and as a primary ore at another.\r\nHypogene ores are dominantly primary, and supergene ores are dominantly\r\nsecondary, but either may include both primary and secondary ores.\r\n\r\nThe terms of these several classifications overlap, and seek to express\r\ndifferent aspects of the same situation. While almost synonymous in\r\ncertain applications they are not in others.\r\n\r\nIn this text the writer has certainly not escaped the difficulties in\r\nregard to names above referred to, nor in fact has he made any\r\nexceptional effort to do so. His chief purpose is to convey, in somewhat\r\nelementary terms, an understandable idea of the central features of\r\neconomic geology. In the main, the most widely accepted terms are used.\r\nAlmost at every turn it would be possible, in the interests of\r\nprecision, to introduce qualifying discussions of names,--but at the\r\nexpense of continuity and perspective in the presentation of the\r\nprincipal subject-matter. The writer does not wish to minimize the\r\nnecessity for careful and precise nomenclature; but he regards it\r\nimportant that the student focus his attention on the central objective\r\nfacts of the subject, and that he do not become misled by the sometimes\r\nover-strenuous advocacy of certain names or classifications in\r\npreference to others. If the facts are understood, he will ordinarily\r\nhave no difficulty in judging the significance of the variety of names\r\nproposed to express these facts. If, on the other hand, the student\r\napproaches the subject with a ready-made set of names and definitions\r\nlearned by rote, he is in danger of perceiving his facts from one angle\r\nonly and through a distorted perspective.\r\n\r\n\r\nMINERAL DEPOSITS AS MAGMATIC SEGREGATIONS IN IGNEOUS ROCKS\r\n\r\nIn this class are included deposits which crystallize within the body of\r\nigneous rock, almost, if not quite, simultaneously with the adjacent\r\nrock. These deposits form one of the main types of _syngenetic_\r\ndeposits.\r\n\r\nThe titaniferous magnetites constitute a widely distributed but at\r\npresent commercially unavailable class of iron ores. The magnetite\r\ncrystals of these deposits interpenetrate with the other constituents of\r\nan igneous rock, commonly of a gabbro type, and the deposits themselves\r\nare essentially igneous rocks. Their shapes are for the most part\r\nirregular, their boundaries ill-defined, and their concentration\r\nvarying. While their magmatic origin is clear, there is little agreement\r\nas to the precise conditions which determined their segregation in the\r\nmolten rock. There is often a tendency for the ores to follow certain\r\nprimary sheeted structures in the igneous mass, a fact for which the\r\nreason is not obvious.\r\n\r\nThe Sudbury nickel ores, of Ontario, Canada, the principal source of the\r\nworld's nickel, lie mainly within and along the lower margin of a great\r\nintrusive igneous mass of a basic type called _norite_, and locally the\r\nores project beyond the margin into adjacent rocks. Their textures and\r\ntheir intercrystallization with the primary minerals of the igneous rock\r\nhave suggested that they are essentially a part of the norite mass, and\r\nthat they crystallized during some segregative processes which were\r\neffective before the magma had solidified. Near the ores there are\r\nlikely to be granitic rocks, which, like the ores, seem to be\r\nsegregations from the norite magma. Locally both the ores and the\r\nassociated granitic rocks replace the main norite body in such a fashion\r\nas to indicate their slightly later crystallization. However, the\r\nintimate association of the ores with the primary minerals in the\r\nmagma, together with their absence from higher parts of the norite and\r\nfrom the extraneous rocks far from the contact, indicate to other\r\ninvestigators that they were not brought in from outside in vagrant\r\nsolutions which followed the intrusion of the main magma, but that they\r\nwere segregated within the magma essentially in place. The occurrence of\r\nthese heavy ores near the base of the norite naturally suggests that\r\nthey were segregated by sinking to the bottom of the molten magma, but\r\nthis conclusion implies certain physical conditions of the magma which\r\nhave not yet been proved. Again the precise nature of the process and\r\nthe part played in it by aqueous and gaseous solutions are subject to\r\nsome doubt and controversy. The settlement of this problem awaits the\r\nsolution of the more general problem of the origin and crystallization\r\nof magmas.\r\n\r\nIn this general class of igneous deposits may be mentioned also\r\ndiamonds, platinum, chromite, corundum, and other mineral products,\r\nalthough for the formation of commercial ores of many of these\r\nsubstances further concentration by weathering and sedimentation has\r\nbeen required.\r\n\r\nPegmatites are coarsely crystalline acid dike rocks which often\r\naccompany a large igneous intrusion and which have obviously\r\ncrystallized somewhat later than the main igneous mass. They may\r\nconstitute either sharply delimited dikes or more irregular bodies which\r\ngrade into the surrounding igneous mass. They have a composition roughly\r\nsimilar to the associated igneous rock, but usually a different\r\nproportion of minerals. They are probably the result of the\r\ndifferentiation of the parent magma. The pegmatites are of especial\r\ninterest to the economic geologist because of the frequency with which\r\nthey carry commercial minerals, such as the precious stones, mica,\r\nfeldspar, cassiterite (tin ore), and others. They show a complete\r\ngradation from dikes of definitely igneous characteristics to veins\r\nconsisting largely of quartz in which evidence of igneous origin is not\r\nso clear. The pegmatites thus afford a connecting link between ores of\r\ndirect igneous sources and ores formed as \"igneous after-effects,\" which\r\nare discussed in the next paragraph. Aplites are fine-grained acid\r\nigneous rocks of somewhat the same composition as the pegmatites and\r\noften show the same general relations to ores.\r\n\r\n\r\nMINERAL DEPOSITS WITHIN AND ADJACENT TO IGNEOUS ROCKS WHICH WERE FORMED\r\nIMMEDIATELY AFTER THE COOLING AND CRYSTALLIZATION OF THE MAGMAS THROUGH\r\nTHE AGENCY OF HOT MAGMATIC SOLUTIONS.\r\n\r\nThese deposits are closely associated in place and age with igneous\r\nrocks, either intrusive or extrusive, and are usually considered to have\r\ncome from approximately the same source; and yet they afford distinct\r\nevidence of having been deposited after the adjacent igneous rocks were\r\ncompletely crystallized and fractured. They are thus _epigenetic_\r\ndeposits. They are not themselves igneous rocks and they do not\r\nconstitute pegmatites, but they often grade into pegmatites and belong\r\nto the same general stage in the sequence of events. They include\r\ndeposits formed by contact metamorphism. They are sometimes designated\r\nby the general term \"igneous after-effects\"--a term also applied in some\r\ncases to pegmatites. Some geologists discriminate between \"deep vein\"\r\ndeposits (p. 43) and \"contact-metamorphic\" deposits, but the two are so\r\nclosely related in place and origin that for our purposes they will be\r\nconsidered together.\r\n\r\nThe ores of this class are clearly deposited from vagrant solutions\r\nwhich wander through openings of all kinds in the igneous rock and\r\noutward into the adjacent country rocks. They also replace the wall\r\nrocks; limestone is especially susceptible. This is a phase of contact\r\nmetamorphism. Some of the most important metalliferous deposits belong\r\nin this class, including most of the gold, silver, copper, iron, lead\r\nand zinc ores of the western United States and the copper deposits of\r\nLake Superior.\r\n\r\nIn general, ores of this class are more abundant about intrusive igneous\r\nrocks, that is about igneous rocks which have stopped and cooled before\r\nreaching the surface,--than in association with extrusive igneous rocks\r\nwhich have poured over the surface as lava flows--but the latter are by\r\nno means insignificant, including as they do such deposits as the Lake\r\nSuperior copper ores, the Kennecott copper ores of Alaska, some of the\r\ngold-silver deposits of Goldfield and other Nevada camps, and many\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nThere is general similarity in the succession of events shown by study\r\nof ore bodies related to intrusives. First, the invasion of the magma,\r\nresulting in contact metamorphism of the adjacent rocks, sometimes with,\r\nand often without conspicuous crowding effects on the invaded rocks;\r\nsecond, the cooling, crystallization, and cracking of both the igneous\r\nrock and the adjacent rock; third, the introduction of ore-bearing\r\nsolutions into these cracks,--sometimes as a single episode, sometimes\r\nas a long continued and complex process forming various types of\r\nminerals at successive stages. This order may in some cases be repeated\r\nin cycles, and overlapping of the successive events is a common feature.\r\n\r\nOne of the interesting facts is the way in which the igneous mass has\r\ninvaded and extensively altered the country rocks in some mineral\r\ndistricts,--in some cases by crowding and crumpling them, and in others\r\nwithout greatly disturbing their structural attitudes. The latter is\r\nillustrated in the Bingham district of Utah and the Philipsburg district\r\nof Montana. In such cases there is so little evidence of crowding of the\r\ncountry rocks as to raise the question how such large masses of\r\nintrusives could be introduced without greater disturbing structural\r\neffect. This leads naturally to consideration of the general problem of\r\nthe manner of progress of magmas through adjacent rocks,--a subject\r\nwhich is still largely in the realm of speculation, but which is not\r\nthereby eliminated from the field of controversy. Facts of this kind\r\nseem to favor the position of certain geologists that magmas may\r\nassimilate the rocks they invade.\r\n\r\n\r\nEVIDENCE OF IGNEOUS SOURCE\r\n\r\nNo one ever saw one of these deposits in the process of formation; the\r\nconclusion, therefore, that they originated from hot solutions, either\r\naqueous or gaseous, or both, which were essentially \"after-effects\" of\r\nigneous activity and came from the same primary source as the associated\r\nigneous rocks, is an inference based on circumstantial evidence of the\r\nkind below summarized:\r\n\r\n(1) The close association both in place and age with igneous rocks. This\r\napplies not only to individual deposits, but to certain groups of\r\ndeposits which have common characteristics, and which constitute a\r\nmetallogenic province; also to groups of the same geologic age, which\r\nindicate a metallogenic epoch (pp. 308-309). The association with\r\nigneous rocks in one place might be a coincidence but its frequent\r\nrepetition can hardly be so explained. A zonal arrangement of minerals\r\nabout intrusives is often noted. Geologic evidence often shows the\r\nprocesses of ore deposition to have been complete before the next\r\nsucceeding geologic event,--as for instance in the Tonopah district of\r\nNevada (p. 236), where the ores have been formed in relation to certain\r\nvolcanic flows and have been covered by later flows not carrying ore,\r\nwithout any considerable erosion interval between the two events.\r\n\r\n(2) The general contrast in mineralogical and chemical composition,\r\ntexture, and mineral associations, between these ore minerals and the\r\nminerals known to be formed by ordinary surficial agencies under\r\nordinary temperatures. The latter carry distinctive evidences of their\r\norigin. When, therefore, a mineral group is found which shows\r\ncontrasting evidences, it is clear that some other agencies have been at\r\nwork; and the natural assumption is that the solutions were hot rather\r\nthan cold; that they came from below rather than above.\r\n\r\n(3) The contrast between the character and composition of these ores\r\n(and their associated gangue) and the character and composition of the\r\nwall rocks, together with the absence of leaching of the wall rocks,\r\nfavor the conclusion that the ore minerals are foreign substances\r\nintroduced from extraneous sources. The source not being apparent above\r\nand the processes there observed not being of a kind to produce these\r\nresults, it is concluded that the depositing solutions were hot and came\r\nfrom below.\r\n\r\n(4) The fact that many of the ore minerals are never known to develop\r\nunder ordinary temperatures at the surface. For some of them,\r\nexperimental work has also indicated high temperature as a requisite to\r\ntheir formation.\r\n\r\nQuartz, which is a common associate of the ores and often constitutes\r\nthe principal gangue, serves as a geologic thermometer in that it\r\npossesses an inversion point or temperature above which it crystallizes\r\nin a certain form, below which in another. In deposits of this class it\r\nhas often been found to crystallize at the higher temperatures.\r\n\r\nThe quartz sometimes shows bubbles containing liquid, gas, and small\r\nheavy crystals, probably of ferric oxide, as in the Clifton-Morenci\r\ndistrict of Arizona. It is clear that the ore-bearing solutions in\r\nthese cavities, before the crystallization of the heavy mineral\r\ninclusions, held dissolved not only much larger quantities of mineral\r\nsubstances than can be taken up by water at ordinary temperatures, but\r\nalso a substance like ferric oxide which is entirely insoluble under\r\nordinary cool conditions.\r\n\r\n(5) The association of the ores with minerals carrying fluorine and\r\nboron, with many silicate minerals, such as garnet, amphiboles,\r\npyroxenes, mica (sericite) and others, and with other minerals which are\r\nknown to be characteristic developments within or near igneous masses\r\nand which are not known to form under weathering agencies at the\r\nsurface. Various characteristic groupings of these associated minerals\r\nare noted. In limestone much of the mass may be replaced by garnet and\r\nother silicates in a matrix of quartz. In igneous rock the ore-bearing\r\nsolutions may have altered the wall rock to a dense mixture of quartz,\r\nsericite, and chlorite. Where sericite is dominant, the alteration is\r\ncalled sericitic alteration. Where chlorite is important, it is\r\nsometimes called chloritic or \"propylitic\" alteration. The chloritic\r\nphases are usually farther from the ore deposit than the sericitic\r\nphases, indicating less intense and probably cooler conditions of\r\ndeposition. Locally other minerals are associated with the ores, as, for\r\ninstance, in the Goldfield district of Nevada (p. 230), where alunite\r\nreplaces the igneous rock. Alunite is a potassium-aluminum sulphate,\r\nwhich differs from sericite in that sulphur takes the place of silicon.\r\nIn the quartzites of the lead-silver mines of the Coeur d'Alene district\r\nof Idaho (p. 212), siderite or iron carbonate is a characteristic gangue\r\nmaterial replacing the wall rock.\r\n\r\nQuartz in some cases, as noted above, gives evidence of high temperature\r\norigin and therefore of igneous association. Jasperoid quartz, as well\r\nillustrated in the Tintic district of Utah (p. 235), may show texture\r\nand crystallization suggestive of deposition from colloidal solution,--a\r\nprocess which can occur under both cold and hot conditions, but which is\r\nbelieved to be accelerated by heat.\r\n\r\nCertain minerals, such as magnetite, ilmenite, spinel, corundum, etc.,\r\nare often found as primary segregations within the mass of igneous rock.\r\nThese and other minerals, including minerals of tin and tungsten,\r\nmonazite, tourmaline, rutile, and various precious stones, are\r\ncharacteristically developed in pegmatites, which are known to be\r\nigneous rocks, crystallized in the later stages of igneous intrusion.\r\nWhen, therefore, such minerals are found in other ore deposits an\r\nigneous source is a plausible inference. For instance, in the copper\r\nveins of Butte, Montana (p. 201), are found cassiterite (tin oxide) and\r\ntungsten minerals. Their presence, therefore, adds another item to the\r\nevidence of a hot-water source from below.\r\n\r\n(6) The occasional existence of hot springs in the vicinity of these ore\r\ndeposits. Where hot springs are of recent age they may suggest by their\r\nheat, steady flow, and mineral content, that they are originating from\r\nemanations from the still cooling magmas. In the Tonopah camp (p. 236),\r\ncold and hot springs exist side by side, exhibiting such contrasts as to\r\nsuggest that some are due to ordinary circulation from the surface and\r\nthat others may have a deep source below in the cooling igneous rocks.\r\nThis evidence is not conclusive. Hot springs in general fail to show\r\nevidence of ore deposition on any scale approximating that which must\r\nhave been involved in the formation of this class of ore bodies. Much\r\nhas been made of the slight amounts of metallic minerals found in a few\r\nhot springs, but the mineral content is small and the conclusion by no\r\nmeans certain that the waters are primary waters from the cooling of\r\nigneous rocks below.\r\n\r\nIn this connection the mercury deposits of California (p. 259),\r\ncontribute a unique line of evidence. In areas of recent lavas, mercuric\r\nsulphide (cinnabar) is actually being deposited from hot springs of\r\nsupposed magmatic origin, the waters of which carry sodium carbonate,\r\nsodium sulphide, and hydrogen sulphide,--a chemical combination known\r\nexperimentally to dissolve mercury sulphide. The oxidation and\r\nneutralization of these hot-spring solutions near the surface throws out\r\nthe mercury sulphide. At the same time the sulphuric acid thus formed\r\nextensively leaches and bleaches the surrounding rocks. Such bleaching\r\nis common about mercury deposits. When it is remembered that the mercury\r\ndeposits contain minor amounts of gold and silver and sulphides of other\r\nmetals; that they are closely associated with gold and silver deposits;\r\nand further that such gold, silver, and other sulphide deposits often\r\ncontain minor amounts of mercury,--it is easy to assume the possibility\r\nthat these minerals may likewise have had their origin in hot solutions\r\nfrom below. The presence of mercury in a deposit then becomes suggestive\r\nof hot-water conditions.\r\n\r\n(7) Ores sometimes occur in inverted troughs indicating lodgment by\r\nsolutions from below, as, for instance, in the saddle-reef gold ores of\r\nNova Scotia and Australia, and in certain copper ores of the Jerome camp\r\nof Arizona (p. 204.) This occurrence does not indicate whether the\r\nsolutions were hot or cold, magmatic or meteoric, but in connection with\r\nother evidences has sometimes been regarded as significant of a magmatic\r\nsource beneath.\r\n\r\nPerhaps no one of these lines of evidence is conclusive; but together\r\nthey make a strong case for the conclusion that the solutions which\r\ndeposited the ores of this class were hot, came from deep sources, and\r\nwere probably primary solutions given off by cooling magmas.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion that some ores are derived from igneous sources, based on\r\nevidence of the kind above outlined, does not mean necessarily that the\r\nore is derived from the immediately adjacent part of the cooling magma.\r\nIn fact the evidence is decisive, in perhaps the majority of cases, that\r\nthe source of the mineral solutions was somewhat below; that these\r\nsolutions may have originated in the same melting-pot with the magma,\r\nbut that they came up independently and a little later,--perhaps along\r\nthe same channels, perhaps along others.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSSIBLE INFLUENCE OF METEORIC WATERS IN DEPOSITION OF ORES OF THIS CLASS\r\n\r\nIt is hardly safe, with existing knowledge, to apply the above\r\nconclusion to all ore deposits with igneous associations, or in any case\r\nto eliminate entirely another agency,--namely, ground-waters of surface\r\nor meteoric origin, which are now present and may be presumed often to\r\nhave been present in the rocks into which the ores were introduced. Such\r\nwaters may have been heated and started in vigorous circulation by the\r\nintroduction of igneous masses, and thereby may have been enabled to\r\neffectively search out and segregate minutely disseminated ore particles\r\nfrom wide areas. This has been suggested as a probability for the\r\nKennecott copper ores of Alaska (p. 200) and for the copper ores of Ely,\r\nNevada. In the Goldfield camp (p. 230) the ores are closely associated\r\nwith alunite in such a manner as to suggest a common origin. It has been\r\nfound difficult to explain the presence of the alunite except through\r\nthe agency of surface oxidizing waters acting on hydrogen sulphide\r\ncoming from below.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of economic geology there was relatively more emphasis\r\non the possible effectiveness of ground-waters in concentrating ores of\r\nthis type. With the recognition of evidence of a deeper source related\r\nto magmas, the emphasis has swung rapidly to the other extreme. While\r\nthe evidence is sound that the magmatic process has been an important\r\none, it is difficult to see how and to just what extent this process may\r\nhave been related to the action of ground-waters,--which were probably\r\npresent in a heated condition near the contact. It may never be possible\r\nto discriminate closely between these two agencies. It seems likely that\r\nat some stages the two were so intimately associated that the net result\r\nof deposition cannot be specifically assigned either to one or to the\r\nother.\r\n\r\n\r\nZONAL ARRANGEMENT OF MINERALS RELATED TO IGNEOUS ROCKS\r\n\r\nEvidence is accumulating in many mining districts that ore deposits of\r\nthese igneous associations were deposited with a rough zonal arrangement\r\nabout the igneous rock. At Bingham, Tintic, and Butte (pp. 204, 208,\r\n235), copper ores are on the whole closest to the igneous rock, and the\r\nlead, zinc, and silver ores are farther away. Furthermore, the quartz\r\ngangue near the igneous rock is likely to contain minerals\r\ncharacteristic of hot solutions, while farther away such minerals as\r\ndolomite and calcite appear in the gangue, suggestive of cooler\r\nconditions. In Cornwall (p. 262), tin ores occur close to the\r\nintrusives, and lead-silver ores farther away. The gradations are by no\r\nmeans uniform; shoots of one class of ore may locally cut abruptly\r\nacross or through those of another class.\r\n\r\nThe existence of zones horizontally or areally arranged about intrusives\r\nsuggests also the possibility of a vertical zonal arrangement with\r\nreference to the deep sources of the solutions. Of course when secondary\r\nconcentration from the surface, described later, is taken into account,\r\nthere may be a marked zonal distribution in a vertical direction, but\r\nthis is not primary zoning. A few veins and districts show evidence of\r\nvertical zoning apparently related to primary deposition; for the most\r\npart, however, in any one mine or camp there is yet little evidence of\r\nprimary vertical zoning. On the other hand, certain groups of minerals\r\nare characteristic of intense conditions of heat and pressure, as\r\nindicated by the coarse recrystallization and high degree of\r\nmetamorphism of the rocks with which they are associated; and other\r\ngroups have such associations as to indicate much less intense\r\nconditions of temperature and pressure. Depth is only one factor\r\ndetermining intensity of conditions, but it affords a convenient way to\r\nindicate them; so mineral deposits associated with igneous rocks are\r\nsometimes classified by economic geologists on the basis of deep,\r\nintermediate, and shallow depths of formation.\r\n\r\nThere are a considerable number of minerals which are formed in all\r\nthree of these zones, although in differing proportions. There are\r\ncomparatively few which are uniformly characteristic of a single zone.\r\nOn the whole, it is possible to contrast satisfactorily mineral deposits\r\nrepresenting very intense metamorphic conditions, usually associated\r\nwith formation at great depth, with those formed at or near the surface;\r\nbut there are many deposits with intermediate characteristics which it\r\nis difficult to place satisfactorily.\r\n\r\nThe accessible deposits of the deep zone are associated with plutonic\r\nigneous rocks which have been deeply eroded, and not with surface lavas.\r\nThey are characterized by minerals of gold, tin, iron, titanium, zinc,\r\nand copper, and sometimes of tungsten and molybdenum, in a gangue of\r\nquartz, which contains also minerals such as garnet, corundum,\r\namphibole, pyroxene, tourmaline, spinel, and mica. The deep-zone\r\nminerals are not unlike the pegmatite minerals in their grouping and\r\nassociations.\r\n\r\nDeposits formed at shallow depths are related to extrusive rocks and to\r\nintrusives near the surface. Erosion has not been deep. Mercury, silver\r\nand gold (tellurides, native metals, and silver sulphides), antimony,\r\nlead, and zinc minerals are characteristic, together with alunite,\r\nadularia, and barite. Metallic copper also is not infrequent. Very often\r\nthe gangue material is more largely calcite than quartz, whereas calcite\r\nis not present in the deep zone.[5]\r\n\r\nThe trend of evidence in recent years has favored the conclusion that\r\nthe principal ores associated with igneous rocks have not developed at\r\nvery great depths. Even within our narrow range of observation there is\r\na difference in favor of the shallower depths, and the greatest depths\r\nwe can observe are after all but trivial on the scale of the earth.\r\n\r\nA survey of the ore deposits of Utah has suggested the generalization\r\nthat ores are more commonly related to intrusive stocks than to the\r\nforms known as laccoliths, and that within and about intrusive stocks\r\nthe ores are much more abundant near the top or apex of a stock than\r\nlower down.[6] In parts of the region where erosion has removed all but\r\nthe deeper portions of the stocks, ore bodies are less abundant. It will\r\nbe of interest to follow the testing of this generalization in other\r\nparts of the world.\r\n\r\nThe scientist is constantly groping for underlying simple truth. Such\r\nglimpses of order and symmetry in the distribution of ore around igneous\r\nrocks as are afforded by the facts above stated, tempt the imagination\r\nto a conception of a simple type or pattern of ore distribution around\r\nintrusions. For this reason we should not lose sight of the fact that,\r\nin the present state of knowledge, the common and obvious case is one of\r\nirregular and heterogeneous distribution, and that there are many\r\nvariations and contradictions even to the simplest generalization that\r\ncan be made. The observer is repeatedly struck by the freakish\r\ndistribution of ores about igneous masses, as compared with their\r\nregularity of arrangement under sedimentary processes to be discussed\r\nlater. It is yet unexplained how an intrusive like the Butte granite can\r\nproduce so many different types of ores at different places along its\r\nperiphery or within its mass, and yet all apparently under much the same\r\ngeneral conditions and range of time. It is difficult also to discern\r\nthe laws under which successive migrations of magma, from what seems to\r\nbe a single deep-seated source or melting-pot, may carry widely\r\ncontrasting mineral solutions. Far below the surface, beyond our range\r\nof observation, it is clear that there is a wonderful laboratory for the\r\ncompounding and refinement of ores, but as to its precise location and\r\nthe nature of its processes we can only guess.\r\n\r\nOther features of distribution of minerals associated with igneous rocks\r\nare indicated by their grouping in metallogenic provinces and epochs\r\n(see pp. 308-309).\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RELATION OF CONTACT METAMORPHISM TO ORE BODIES OF THE FOREGOING CLASS.\r\n\r\nThe deposition of ores of igneous source in the country rock into which\r\nthe igneous rocks are intruded is a phase of contact metamorphism.\r\nOrdinarily where this deposition occurs there are further extensive\r\nreplacements and alterations of the country rock, resulting in the\r\ndevelopment of great masses of quartz, garnet, pyroxene, amphibole, and\r\nother silicates, and in some cases of calcite, dolomite, siderite,\r\nbarite, alunite, and other minerals. Looked at broadly, the deposition\r\nof ores at igneous contacts under contact metamorphism is a mere\r\nincident in the much more widespread and extensive alterations of this\r\nkind. Hence it is that the subject of contact metamorphism is of\r\ninterest to economic geologists. The minerals here formed which do not\r\nconstitute ores throw much light on the nature of the ore-bearing\r\nsolutions, the conditions of temperature and pressure, and the processes\r\nwhich locally and incidentally develop the ore bodies. The subject,\r\nhowever, is a complex one, the full discussion of which belongs in\r\ntreatises on metamorphism.[7] We may note only a few salient features.\r\n\r\nFor many hundreds of yards the rocks adjacent to the intrusions may be\r\nmetamorphosed almost beyond recognition. This is especially true of the\r\nlimestone, which may be changed completely to solid masses of quartz and\r\nsilicates. The shales and sandstones are ordinarily less vitally\r\naffected. The shales become dense, highly crystalline rocks of a\r\n\"hornstone\" type, with porphyritic developments of silicate minerals.\r\nThe sands and sandstones become highly crystalline quartzites, spotted\r\nwith porphyritic developments of silicates. Occasionally even these\r\nrocks may be extensively replaced by other minerals, as in the Coeur\r\nd'Alene district, where quartzites adjacent to the ore veins may be\r\ncompletely replaced by iron carbonate.\r\n\r\nA question of special interest to economic geologists is the source of\r\nthe materials for the new minerals in these extensively altered zones.\r\nIn some cases the minerals are known to be the result of\r\nrecrystallization of materials already in the rock, after the\r\nelimination of certain substances such as carbon dioxide and lime, under\r\nthe pressures and temperatures of the contact conditions. In such cases\r\nthere has obviously been large reduction in volume to close the voids\r\ncreated by the elimination of substances. In the majority of cases, the\r\nnew substances or minerals are clearly introduced from the igneous\r\nsource, replacing the wall rock volume for volume so precisely that such\r\noriginal textures and structures as bedding are not destroyed. In many\r\ncases the result is clearly due to a combination of recrystallization of\r\nmaterials already present and introduction of minerals by magmatic\r\nsolutions from without. So obvious is the evidence of the introduction\r\nof materials from without, that there has been a tendency in some\r\nquarters to overlook the extensive recrystallization of substances\r\nalready present; and the varying emphasis placed on these two processes\r\nby different observers has led to some controversy.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECONDARY CONCENTRATION IN PLACE OF THE FOREGOING CLASSES OF MINERAL\r\nDEPOSITS THROUGH THE AGENCY OF SURFACE SOLUTIONS\r\n\r\nMineral deposits of direct magmatic segregation are seldom much affected\r\nby surficial alteration, perhaps because of their coarse crystallization\r\nand their intermingling with resistant crystalline rocks. Mineral\r\ndeposits of the \"igneous after-effect\" type may be profoundly altered\r\nthrough surficial agencies. The more soluble constituents are taken\r\naway, leaving the less soluble. The parts that remain are likely to be\r\nconverted into oxides, carbonates, and hydrates, through reaction with\r\noxygen, carbon dioxide, and water, which are always present at the\r\nsurface and at shallow depths. These processes are most effective at the\r\nsurface and down to the level of permanent ground-water, though locally\r\nthey may extend deeper. This altered upper part of the ore bodies is\r\nusually called the _oxide zone_. It may represent either an enrichment\r\nor a depletion of ore values, depending on whether the ore minerals are\r\ntaken into solution less rapidly or more rapidly than the associated\r\nminerals and rocks; all are removed to some extent. In certain deposits,\r\nthere is evidence that both zinc and copper have been taken out of the\r\nupper zone in great quantity; but they happen to be associated with\r\nlimestone, which has dissolved still more rapidly, with the result that\r\nthere is a residual accumulation of copper and zinc values. Manganese,\r\niron, and quartz are usually more resistant than the other minerals and\r\ntend to remain concentrated above. The same is true to some extent of\r\ngold and silver. The abundance of iron oxide thus left explains the name\r\n\"iron cap\" or \"gossan\" so often applied to the upper part of the oxide\r\nzone. Not infrequently, and especially in copper ores, the upper part of\r\nthe oxide zone is nearly or entirely barren of values and is called the\r\n_capping_.\r\n\r\nThe depth or thickness of the oxide zone depends on topography, depth of\r\nwater table, climatic conditions, and speed of erosion. A fortunate\r\ncombination of conditions may result in a deep oxide zone with important\r\naccumulations of values. In other cases erosion may follow oxidation so\r\nrapidly as to prevent the growth of a thick oxide zone.\r\n\r\nIt is clear from the study of many ore deposits that the process of\r\noxidation has not proceeded uniformly to the present, but has depended\r\nupon a fortunate combination of factors which has not been often\r\nrepeated during geologic time. As illustrative of this, the principal\r\noxidation of the Bisbee copper ores of Arizona (p. 204) occurred before\r\nTertiary time, with reference to a place that has since been covered by\r\nlater sediments. The conditions in the Ray, Miami, and Jerome copper\r\ncamps of Arizona (pp. 203-205) likewise indicate maximum oxidation at an\r\nearly period. The Lake Superior iron ore deposits (pp. 167-170) were\r\nmainly concentrated before Cambrian time, during the base-leveling of a\r\nmountainous country in an arid or semi-arid climate. The oxide zone of\r\nthese deposits has no close relation to the present topography or to the\r\npresent ground-water level. In the Kennecott (Alaska) copper deposits\r\nall oxidation has been stopped since glacial time by the freezing of the\r\naqueous solutions. At Butte and at Bingham the main concentration of the\r\nores is believed to have occurred in an earlier physiographic cycle than\r\nthe present one. The _cyclic_ nature of the formation of oxide zones is\r\nof comparatively recent recognition, and much more will doubtless be\r\nfound out about it in the comparatively near future. Its practical\r\nbearing on exploration is obvious (see p. 325).\r\n\r\nIt should be clearly recognized that oxidizing processes are not limited\r\nto the zone above the ground-water level. Locally oxidizing solutions\r\nmay penetrate and do effective work to much greater depths, especially\r\nwhere the rocks traversed at higher elevations are of such composition\r\nor in such a stage of alteration as not to extract most of the oxygen.\r\nConsequently the presence of oxide ores below the water table is not\r\nnecessarily proof that the water table has risen since their formation.\r\nOn the other hand, the facts of observation do indicate generally a\r\nmarked difference, in circulation and chemical effect, between waters\r\nabove and below this horizon, and show that oxidation is dominantly\r\naccomplished above rather than below this datum surface.\r\n\r\nDuring the formation of the oxide zone, erosion removes some of the ore\r\nmaterials entirely from the area, both mechanically and in solution.\r\nPart of the material in solution, however, is known to penetrate\r\ndownward and to be redeposited in parts of the ore body below the oxide\r\nzone,--that is, usually below the water table. Evidence of this process\r\nis decisive in regard to several minerals. Copper is known to be taken\r\ninto solution as copper sulphate at the surface, and to be redeposited\r\nas chalcocite where these sulphate solutions come in contact with\r\nchalcopyrite or pyrite below. Not only has the process been duplicated\r\nin the laboratory, but the common coating of chalcocite around grains of\r\npyrite and chalcopyrite below the water level indicates that this\r\nprocess has been really effective. Sulphides of zinc, lead, silver, and\r\nother metals are similarly concentrated, in varying degrees. The zone of\r\ndeposition of secondary sulphides thus formed is called the zone of\r\n_secondary sulphide enrichment_. Ores consisting mainly of secondary\r\nsulphides are also called _supergene_ ores (p. 33). In some deposits, as\r\nin the copper deposits of Ray and Miami, there is found, below the\r\nsecondary sulphide zone, a lean sulphide zone which is evidently of\r\nprimary nature. The mineralized material of this zone, where too lean to\r\nmine, has been called a _protore_.\r\n\r\nWith the discovery of undoubted evidence of secondary sulphide\r\nenrichment, there was a natural tendency to magnify its importance as a\r\ncause of values. Continued study of sulphide deposits, while not\r\ndisproving its existence and local importance, has in some districts\r\nshown clearly that the process has its limitations as a factor in ore\r\nconcentration, and that it is not safe to assume its effectiveness in\r\nall camps or under all conditions. At Butte for instance, secondary\r\nchalcocite is clearly to be recognized. The natural inference was that\r\nas the veins were followed deeper the proportion of chalcocite would\r\nrapidly diminish, and that a leaner primary zone of chalcopyrite,\r\nenargite and other primary minerals would be met. However, the great\r\nabundance of chalcocite in solid masses which have now been proved to a\r\ndepth of 3500 feet, far below the probable range of waters from the\r\nsurface in any geologic period, seems to indicate that much of the\r\nchalcocite is primary. The present tendency at Butte is to consider as\r\nsecondary chalcocite only certain sooty phases to be found in upper\r\nlevels. The solid masses of chalcocite in the Kennecott copper mines\r\nseem hardly explainable as the result of secondary sulphide enrichment.\r\nNo traces of other primary minerals are present and the chalcocite here\r\nis regarded as probably primary.\r\n\r\nThe possible magnification of the process of secondary enrichment above\r\nreferred to has had for its logical consequence a tendency to\r\nover-emphasize the persistence of primary ores in depth. The very use of\r\nthe terms \"secondary\" and \"primary\" has suggested antithesis between\r\nsurficial and deep ores. Progress in investigation, as indicated on\r\nprevious pages, seems to indicate that the primary ores are not\r\nuniformly deep and that in many cases they are distinctly limited to a\r\ngiven set of formations or conditions comparatively near the surface.\r\n\r\nIn general the processes of oxidation and secondary sulphide enrichment\r\nhave been studied mainly by qualitative methods with the aid of the\r\nmicroscope and by considerations of possible chemical processes. These\r\nmethods have disclosed the nature but not the quantitative range and\r\nrelations of the different processes. Much remains to be done in the way\r\nof large scale quantitative analysis of ores at different depths, as a\r\ncheck to inferences drawn by other methods. One may know, for instance,\r\nthat a mineral is soluble and is actually removed from the oxide zone\r\nand redeposited below. The natural inference, therefore, is that the\r\nmineral will be found to be depleted above and enriched below. In many\r\ncases its actual distribution is the reverse,--indicating that this\r\nprocess has been only one of the factors in the net result, the more\r\nrapid solution and deposition of other materials being another factor.\r\nIf one were to approach the study of the concentration of iron ores with\r\nthe fixed idea of insolubility of quartz from a chemical standpoint, and\r\nwere to draw conclusions accordingly, he would fail to present a true\r\npicture of the situation. While quartz is insoluble as compared with\r\nmost minerals, it is nevertheless more soluble than iron oxide, and\r\ntherefore the net result of concentration at the surface is to\r\naccumulate the iron rather than the silica. Descriptions of enrichment\r\nprocesses as published in many reports are often misleading in this\r\nregard. They may be correct in indicating the actual existence of a\r\nprocess, but may lead the reader to assumptions as to net results which\r\nare incorrect.\r\n\r\n\r\nRESIDUAL MINERAL DEPOSITS FORMED BY THE WEATHERING OF IGNEOUS ROCKS IN\r\nPLACE\r\n\r\nIgneous rocks not containing mineral deposits may on weathering change\r\nto mineral deposits. The lateritic iron ores such as those of Cuba (p.\r\n172), many bauxite deposits, many residual clays, and certain chromite\r\nand nickel deposits are conspicuous representatives of this class. The\r\nchemical and mineralogical changes involved in the formation of these\r\ndeposits are pretty well understood. Certain constituents of the\r\noriginal rock are leached out and carried away, leaving other\r\nconstituents, as oxides and hydrates, in sufficiently large percentage\r\nin the mass to be commercially available. The accumulation of large\r\ndeposits depends on the existence of climatic and erosional conditions\r\nwhich determine that the residual deposit shall remain in place rather\r\nthan be carried off by erosion as fast as made. In the glaciated parts\r\nof the world, deposits of this nature have usually been removed and\r\ndispersed in the glacial drift.\r\n\r\nWhen the minerals of these deposits are eroded, transported, and\r\nredeposited in concentrated form, they come under the class of placer or\r\nsedimentary deposits described under the following heading. There are of\r\ncourse many intermediate stages, where the residual deposit is only\r\nlocally moved and where the distinction between this class of deposits\r\nand that next described is an arbitrary one.\r\n\r\n\r\nMINERAL DEPOSITS FORMED DIRECTLY AS PLACERS AND SEDIMENTS\r\n\r\nMineral deposits of this class are of large value, including as they do\r\nsalt, gypsum, potash, sulphur, phosphates, nitrates, and important\r\nfractions of the ores of iron, manganese, gold, tin, tungsten, platinum,\r\nand precious stones; also many common rocks of commercial importance.\r\nThe minerals of these deposits are derived from the weathering and\r\nerosion of land surfaces, either igneous or sedimentary. They are\r\ndeposited both under air and under water, both mechanically and\r\nchemically (in part by the aid of organisms). These deposits form the\r\nprincipal type of _syngenetic_ deposits (p. 32); the term _sedigenetic_\r\ndeposits has also been applied to them.\r\n\r\n\r\nMECHANICALLY DEPOSITED MINERALS\r\n\r\nMechanical erosion of preexisting mineral deposits or rocks and their\r\ntransportation, sorting, and deposition are responsible for the placers\r\nof gold, tin, tungsten, platinum, and various precious stones, and for\r\ncertain iron sands and conglomerates. Sands, sandstones, shales, and\r\ncertain clays and bauxites also belong in this group. These deposits may\r\nbe formed under air or under water, and under various climatic and\r\ntopographic conditions. During the process of formation the minerals of\r\ndiffering density are more or less sorted out and tend to become\r\nsegregated in layers. The process is not unlike the artificial process\r\nof mechanical concentration where ores are crushed, shaken up, and\r\ntreated with running water. The process is most effective for minerals\r\nwhich are resistant to abrasion and to solution, and of such density as\r\nto differentiate them from the other minerals of the parent rock.\r\n\r\nThe origin of deposits of this kind is fairly obvious where they are of\r\nrecent age and have not been subsequently altered or buried. A\r\nconsiderable amount of experimental work has brought out clearly the\r\nmain elements of the processes. Physiographic and climatic conditions\r\nplay an important part, and cannot be safely overlooked by anyone\r\nstudying such deposits.\r\n\r\nExtensive copper deposits exist as sediments (pp. 205-206). It is not\r\nclear to what extent they are mechanically or to what extent chemically\r\ndeposited. For the most part the concentration of copper in this manner\r\nhas not been sufficient to yield deposits of large commercial value; the\r\nmineral is too much dispersed. Relatively small amounts are mined in the\r\nMansfield shales of Germany and the Nonesuch shales and sandstones of\r\nthe Lake Superior country.\r\n\r\nThe Clinton and similar iron ores of the United States and Newfoundland,\r\nthe pre-Cambrian iron ores of Brazil, and the Jurassic iron ores of\r\nEngland and western Europe (pp. 166-167) are now commonly agreed to be\r\ndirect sedimentary deposits in which mechanical agencies of sorting and\r\ndeposition played a considerable part. How far chemical and bacterial\r\nagencies have also been effective is not clear. The climatic,\r\ntopographic, and other physiographic and sedimentary conditions which\r\ncause the deposition of this great group of ores present one of the\r\ngreat unsolved problems of economic geology. The study of present-day\r\nconditions of deposition affords little clue as to the peculiar\r\ncombination of conditions which was necessary to accomplish such\r\nremarkable results in the past.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, minerals of this mechanically deposited group are not\r\ngreatly affected by later surficial alteration and concentration,\r\nbecause, having already been subjected to weathering, they are in a\r\ncondition to resist such influences.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEMICALLY AND ORGANICALLY DEPOSITED MINERALS\r\n\r\nThe products of surface weathering and erosion are in part carried away\r\nin chemical solution and redeposited as sediments. Sediments thus formed\r\ninclude limestone and dolomite, siderite, salt, gypsum, potash, sulphur,\r\nphosphates, nitrates, and other minerals. Precipitation may be caused by\r\nchemical reactions, by organic secretion, or by evaporation of the\r\nsolutions. The processes are qualitatively understood and it is usually\r\npossible to ascertain with reasonable accuracy the conditions of depth\r\nof water, relation to shore line, climate, nature of erosion, and other\r\nsimilar factors; yet the vast scale of some of these deposits, and their\r\nerratic areal and stratigraphic distribution, present unsolved problems\r\nas to the precise combinations of factors which have made such results\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nChemically and organically deposited minerals of this class are usually\r\nsusceptible to further alteration by surface weathering, and some of\r\nthem, for instance the phosphates and siderites, are thus secondarily\r\nconcentrated. These processes are discussed under the next heading.\r\n\r\nIn general the great unsolved problem of the origin of the entire group\r\nof mineral deposits in placers and sediments relates to the scale of the\r\nresults. Observation of present-day processes and conditions of\r\ndeposition of these minerals affords satisfactory evidence of their\r\nnature, but fails to give us a clear idea of the precise combinations of\r\nagencies and conditions necessary to produce such vast results as are\r\nrepresented by the mineral deposits. For example, solution of iron on a\r\nland surface and redeposition in bogs and lagoons (as actually observed\r\nto be taking place today) show how some iron-ore sediments may be\r\nformed; but these processes are entirely inadequate to explain the\r\ndeposition of iron ores in thick masses over broad areas without\r\nintermingling of other sediments--as represented by the Clinton iron\r\nores of North America, the Jurassic ores of Europe and England, and the\r\nancient iron ores of Brazil. The Paleozoic seas in northern and eastern\r\nUnited States encroached over land areas to the north and east and\r\ndeposited ordinary sediments such as sandstone, shale, and limestone.\r\nSuddenly, without, so far as known, tapping any new sources of supply on\r\nthe ancient land areas, and without any yet ascertainable change in\r\ntopographic or climatic conditions, they deposited enormous masses of\r\niron ore. There is clearly some cyclic factor in the situation which we\r\ndo not yet understand.\r\n\r\nThe various deposits of salt, gypsum, potash, sulphur, and other\r\nminerals are known to be the result of evaporation, and the deposition\r\nof each of these minerals is known to be related to the degree of\r\nevaporation as well as to temperature, pressure, and factors such as\r\nmass action and crystallization of double salts. The nature of the\r\nprocesses is fairly well understood; but again, observation of the\r\npresent-day operation of these processes fails to give us much clue to\r\nthe enormous accumulations at certain times and places in the past. It\r\nis difficult to say just what conditions of climate, in combination with\r\nparticular physiographic factors, could have preserved uniformity of\r\nconditions for the long periods necessary to account for some of the\r\nenormously thick salt deposits. Again some cyclic factor in the\r\nsituation remains to be worked out.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEDIMENTARY MINERAL DEPOSITS WHICH HAVE REQUIRED FURTHER CONCENTRATION\r\nTO MAKE THEM COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE\r\n\r\nThe conditions for the direct deposition of sedimentary mineral deposits\r\nof the foregoing class are also responsible for the deposition of\r\nminerals in more dispersed or disseminated form, requiring further\r\nconcentration through surface agencies to render them commercially\r\navailable. Some of these deposits are discussed below.\r\n\r\nThe lead and zinc ores of the Mississippi Valley, Virginia, Tennessee,\r\nSilesia, Belgium, and Germany (pp. 211-212, 216-219) are in sedimentary\r\nrocks far removed from igneous sources. Lead and zinc were deposited in\r\nmore or less dispersed form with the enclosing sediments. It is supposed\r\nthat deposition was originally chemical and was favored by the presence\r\nof organic material, which is a rather common accompaniment of the\r\nsediments. It is supposed further that these organic participants were\r\noriginally localized during sedimentation in so-called estuarine\r\nchannels and shore-line embayments. When subsequently exposed to\r\nweathering, the lead and zinc minerals were dissolved and redeposited in\r\nmore concentrated form in fissures and as replacements of limestone.\r\n\r\nAgreement as to origin of these deposits, so far as it exists, does not\r\ngo beyond these broad generalizations. There is controversy as to\r\nwhether the original sources of the ore minerals were the sediments\r\ndirectly above, from which the mineral solutions have been transferred\r\ndownward during weathering and erosion, or whether the original minerals\r\nwere below and have been transferred upward by artesian circulation, or\r\nwhether they were situated laterally and have been brought to their\r\npresent position by movement along the beds, or whether there has been\r\nsome combination of these processes. It is the writer's view that the\r\nevidence thus far gathered favors on the whole the conclusion of direct\r\ndownward concentration from overlying sources which have been removed by\r\nerosion, although this conclusion fails to explain why certain sulphide\r\ndeposits give so little evidence of important downward transfer from\r\ntheir present position. This matter is further discussed on pages\r\n216-219. The choice of the various alternatives has some practical\r\nbearing on exploration.\r\n\r\nSince these ores were brought into approximately their present\r\nposition, they have undergone considerable oxidation near the surface\r\nand secondary sulphide enrichment below. The chemical and mineralogical\r\nchanges are pretty well understood, but the quantitative range of these\r\nchanges and their relative importance in determining the net result are\r\nfar from known. Undoubted evidence of secondary sulphide enrichment has\r\nled in some quarters to an assumption of effectiveness in producing\r\nvalues which is apparently not borne out by quantitative tests.\r\n\r\nA group of mineral deposits in sandstones in Utah is regarded as due to\r\nchemical concentration of material originally disseminated in the rock.\r\nThey include silver, copper, manganese, uranium, and radium deposits.\r\nThe Silver Reef deposits, including silver, copper, uranium, and\r\nvanadium, are commercially the most important of this type.[8] The ore\r\nminerals are commonly associated with carbonized material representing\r\nplant remains, and have replaced the calcareous and cementing material\r\nof the rock, and also some of the quartz grains. The deposits are\r\nregarded as having been formed by circulating waters which collected the\r\nminerals disseminated through the sedimentary rocks, and deposited them\r\non contact with carbonaceous matter, earlier sulphides, or other\r\nprecipitating agents. The circulation in some places is believed to have\r\nbeen of artesian character and to have been controlled to a large extent\r\nby structural features. The Silver Reef deposits are near the crest of a\r\nprominent anticline. Most of the minerals have been later altered by\r\nsurface solutions.\r\n\r\nAnother great group of ores to be considered under this head are the\r\niron ores of Lake Superior,--which were originally deposited as\r\nsediments, called jaspers or iron formations, with too low a percentage\r\nof iron to be of use, and which have required a secondary concentration\r\nby surficial agencies to render them valuable. The process of\r\nconcentration has been a simple one. The iron minerals have been\r\noxidized in place and the non-ferrous minerals have been leached out,\r\nleaving iron ores. This process contrasts with the concentration\r\ndescribed above, in that there is little evidence of collection of iron\r\nminerals from disseminated sources. The Lake Superior iron ores are\r\nessentially residual concentrations in place. The outstanding problems\r\nof secondary concentration relate to the structural features which\r\ndetermined the channels through which the oxidizing and leaching waters\r\nworked, and to the topographic and climatic conditions which existed at\r\nthe time the work was done. As with many other classes of ores, it was\r\nfirst assumed that these processes were related to the present erosion\r\nsurface; but it is now known that concentration happened long ago under\r\nconditions far different from those now existing. These deposits\r\ncontribute to the rapidly accumulating evidence of the _cyclic_ nature\r\nof ore concentration.\r\n\r\nOur least satisfactory knowledge of the Lake Superior ores relates to\r\nthe peculiar conditions which determined the initial stage of\r\nsedimentation of the so-called iron formation. As in the case of the\r\nClinton iron ores, no present-day sedimentation gives an adequate clue.\r\nStudents of the problem have fallen back on the association of the iron\r\nformation with contemporaneous volcanic rocks, as affording a possible\r\nexplanation of the wide departure from ordinary conditions of\r\nsedimentation evidenced by these formations.[9]\r\n\r\nCoal deposits are direct results of sedimentation of organic material.\r\nThey are mainly accumulations of vegetable matter in place. To make them\r\navailable for use, however, they undergo a long period of condensation\r\nand distillation. Conditions of primary deposition may be inferred from\r\nmodern swamps and bogs; but, as in the case of sediments described under\r\nthe preceding heading, we are sometimes at a loss to explain the\r\nmagnitude of the process, and especially to explain the maintenance of\r\nproper surface conditions of plant growth and accumulation for the long\r\nperiods during which subsidence of land areas and encroachment of seas\r\nare believed to have been taking place. The processes of secondary\r\nconcentration are also understood qualitatively, but much remains to be\r\nlearned about the influences of pressure and heat, the effect of\r\nimpervious capping rocks, and other factors.\r\n\r\nVarious oil shales and asphaltic deposits are essentially original\r\nsediments which have subsequently undergone more or less decay and\r\ndistillation. The migration of the distillates to suitable underground\r\nreservoirs is responsible for the accumulation of oil and gas pools.\r\n\r\nOil and gas are distillates from these oil shales and asphaltic\r\ndeposits, and also from other organic sediments such as carbonaceous\r\nlimestones. The distillates have migrated to their present positions\r\nunder pressure of ground-waters. The stratigraphic horizons favorable to\r\ntheir accumulation are generally recognized. The geologist is concerned\r\nin identifying these horizons and in ascertaining where they exist\r\nunderground. He is further concerned in analysis of the various\r\nstructural conditions which will give a clue to the existence of local\r\nreservoirs in which the oil or gas may have been accumulated. So\r\ncapricious are the oil migrations that the most intensive study of these\r\nconditions still leaves vast undiscovered possibilities.\r\n\r\n\r\nANAMORPHISM OF MINERAL DEPOSITS\r\n\r\nMineral deposits formed in any one of the ways indicated above may\r\nundergo repeated vicissitudes, both at the surface and deep below the\r\nsurface, with consequent modifications of character. They may be\r\ncemented or replaced by introduction of mineral solutions from without.\r\nThey may be deformed by great earth pressures, undergoing what is called\r\ndynamic metamorphism (pp. 25-27), which tends to distort them and give\r\nthem schistose and crystalline characters. They may be intruded by\r\nigneous rocks, causing considerable chemical, mineralogical, and\r\nstructural changes. All these changes may take place near the surface,\r\nbut on the whole they are more abundant and have more marked effects\r\ndeep below the surface.\r\n\r\nIn general all these changes of the deeper zone tend to make the rocks\r\nmore crystalline and dense and to make the minerals more complex.\r\nCavities are closed. The process is in the main an integrating and\r\nconstructive one which has been called _anamorphism_, to contrast it\r\nwith the disintegrating and destructive processes near the surface,\r\nwhich have been called _katamorphism_ (see also pp. 27-28). There is\r\nlittle in the process of anamorphism in the way of sorting and\r\nsegregation which tends to enrich and concentrate the metallic ore\r\nbodies. On the contrary the process tends to lock up the valuable\r\nminerals in resistant combinations with other substances, making them\r\nmore difficult to recover in mining. Later igneous intrusions or the\r\nordinary ground-waters may bring in minerals which locally enrich ores\r\nunder anamorphic conditions, but these are relatively minor effects. An\r\nillustration of the general effect is afforded by a comparison of the\r\nCuban iron ores, which are soft and can be easily taken out, with the\r\nCle Elum iron ores of Washington, which seem to be of much the same\r\norigin, but which have subsequently been buried by other rocks and\r\nrendered hard and crystalline. In the first case the ores can be mined\r\neasily and cheaply with steam shovels at the surface. In the second,\r\nunderground methods of mining are required, which cost too much for the\r\ngrade of ore recovered.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the same general kind of anamorphic processes, when\r\napplied to coal, result in concentration and improvement of grade. The\r\nsame is true up to a certain point in the concentration of oil; but\r\nwhere the process goes too far, the oil may be lost (pp. 140-141).\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nMineral deposits are formed and modified by practically all known\r\ngeologic processes, but looked at broadly the main values are produced\r\nin three principal ways:\r\n\r\n(1) As after effects of igneous intrusion, through the agency of aqueous\r\nand gaseous solutions given off from the cooling magma.\r\n\r\n(2) Through the sorting processes of sedimentation,--the same processes\r\nwhich form sandstone, shale, and limestone. Organic agencies are\r\nimportant factors in these processes.\r\n\r\n(3) Through weathering of the rock surface in place, which may develop\r\nvalues either by dissolving out the valuable minerals and redepositing\r\nthem in concentrated form, or by dissolving out the non-valuable\r\nminerals and leaving the valuable minerals concentrated in place. The\r\nlatter process is by far the more important.\r\n\r\nThe overwhelming preponderance of values of mineral deposits as a whole\r\nis found in the second of the classes named.\r\n\r\nUnder all these conditions it appears that the maximum results are\r\nobtained at and near the surface. On the scale of the earth even the\r\nso-called deep veins may be regarded as deposits from solutions reaching\r\nthe more open and cooler outer portions of the earth. However, valuable\r\nmineral deposits are found in the deepest rocks which have been exposed\r\nby erosion, and the question of what would be found at still greater\r\ndepths, closer to the center of the earth, is a matter of pure\r\nspeculation.\r\n\r\nUltimately all minerals are derived from igneous sources within the\r\nearth. The direct contributions from these sources are only in small\r\npart of sufficient concentration to be of value; for the most part they\r\nneed sorting and segregation under surface conditions.\r\n\r\nWe can only speculate as to causes of the occurrence of valuable\r\nminerals in certain igneous rocks and not in others. Many granites are\r\nintruded into the outer shell of the earth, but only a few carry\r\n\"minerals\"; also, of a series of intrusions in the same locality, only\r\none may carry valuable minerals. It is clear that in some fashion these\r\nminerals are primarily segregated within the earth. Causes of this\r\nsegregation are so involved with the problem of the origin of the earth\r\nas a whole that no adequate explanation can yet be offered. Our\r\ninductive reasoning from known facts is as yet limited to the\r\nsegregation within a given mass of magma, and even here the conditions\r\nare only dimly perceived. A discussion of these ultimate problems is\r\nbeyond the scope of this book.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[4] Ransome, Frederick Leslie, Copper deposits near Superior, Arizona:\r\n_Bull. 540, U. S. Geol.

The purpose is to indicate the general\r\nperspective rather than the detail which would be necessary for precise\r\nstatement.\r\n\r\n\r\nWORLD ANNUAL PRODUCTION OF MINERALS IN SHORT TONS\r\n\r\nExclusive of water, but inclusive of petroleum, the world's annual\r\noutput of mineral resources amounts to two billions of tons. This figure\r\nrefers to the crude mineral as it comes from the ground and not to the\r\nmineral in its concentrated form.\r\n\r\nOf this total extraction, coal amounts to nearly 70 per cent, stone and\r\nclay 10 per cent, iron ore about 9 per cent, petroleum 4 per cent,\r\ncopper ore 3 per cent, and all the remaining minerals constitute less\r\nthan 6 per cent.\r\n\r\nIf spread out on the surface in a uniform mass with an estimated average\r\ndensity based on relative proportions of the crude minerals, this annual\r\nproduction would cover a square mile to a depth of 2,300 feet.\r\n\r\nOf the total annual production 85 per cent comes from countries\r\nbordering the North Atlantic basin; 75 per cent is accounted for by the\r\nUnited States, England, and Germany; the United States has 39 per cent\r\nof the total, England 18 per cent, and Germany 18 per cent. By\r\ncontinents, Europe accounts for nearly 51 per cent, North America for\r\nnearly 42 per cent, Asia for nearly 4 per cent, and the remaining\r\ncontinents for nearly 4 per cent. The United States mineral production\r\nin recent years has been about 900,000,000 tons.\r\n\r\nAccording to the United States census of 1920, nearly half of all the\r\nestablishments or businesses engaged in quarrying or mining operations\r\nin this country are operating in oil and gas.\r\n\r\nOf the crude materials extracted from the ground perhaps 10 per cent,\r\nincluding gold, silver, copper, lead, zinc, nickel, and other ores, are\r\nconcentrated mainly at the mine, with the result that this fraction of\r\nthe tonnage in large part does not travel beyond the mine. About 90 per\r\ncent of the total production, therefore, figures largely in the\r\ntransportation of mineral resources.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that roughly two-thirds of the annual world production\r\nis used or smelted within the countries of origin, the remaining\r\none-third being exported. Of the minerals moving internationally, coal\r\nand iron constitute 90 per cent of the tonnage.\r\n\r\nThe metal smelting capacity of the world in terms of yearly production\r\nof crude metal is estimated at nearly 100,000,000 short tons. Of this\r\namount about 80 per cent is located in the United States, England, and\r\nGermany. The United States alone has over half of the total. Of the\r\noil-refining capacity the United States controls nearly 70 per cent.\r\n\r\nOne of the significant features of the situation above summarized is the\r\nconcentration of production and smelting in a comparatively few places\r\nin the world. This statement applies with even more force to the\r\nindividual mineral commodities.\r\n\r\nWater may be regarded as a mineral resource in so far as it is utilized\r\nas a commodity for drinking, washing, power, irrigation, and other\r\nindustrial uses. For purposes of navigation and drainage, or as a\r\ndeterrent in excavation, it would probably not be so classed. While it\r\nis not easy to define the limits of water's use as a mineral resource,\r\nit is clear that even with a narrow interpretation the total tonnage\r\nextracted from the earth as a mineral resource exceeds in amount all\r\nother mineral resources combined.\r\n\r\n\r\nWORLD ANNUAL PRODUCTION OF MINERALS IN TERMS OF VALUE\r\n\r\nIn terms of value, mineral resources appear in different perspective.\r\nThe annual world value of mineral production, exclusive of water, is\r\napproximately $9,000,000,000. This figure is obtained by dividing the\r\nannual value of the United States output of each of the principal\r\nminerals by the percentage which the United States output constitutes in\r\nthe world output, and adding the figures thus obtained. The values here\r\nused are mainly selling prices at the mines. It is impossible to reduce\r\nthe figures absolutely to the value of the mineral as it comes from the\r\nground; there are always some items of transportation included. This\r\nmethod of figuring is of course only the roughest approximation; the\r\nvalues as obtained in the United States cannot be accurately\r\nexterpolated for the rest of the world because of locally varying\r\nconditions. However, the figures will serve for rough comparative\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nOf this total value coal represents roughly 61 per cent, petroleum 12\r\nper cent, iron 6 per cent, copper 5 per cent, and gold 3 per cent.\r\n\r\nIn terms of value, about 25 per cent of the world's mineral production\r\nis available for export beyond the countries of origin. Of this\r\nexportable surplus the United States has about 40 per cent, consisting\r\nprincipally of coal, copper, and formerly petroleum.\r\n\r\nThe value of the United States annual mineral production in recent years\r\nhas been from about $3,500,000,000 to $5,500,000,000. Annual imports of\r\nmineral products into the United States have averaged recently in the\r\ngeneral vicinity of $450,000,000, the larger items being copper, tin,\r\nfertilizers, petroleum, gems and precious stones, manganese, nickel, and\r\ntungsten.\r\n\r\nAgain the perspective is changed when the value of water resources is\r\nconsidered. As a physiologically indispensable resource, the value of\r\nwater in one sense is infinite. There is no way of putting an accurate\r\nvalue on the total annual output used for drinking and domestic\r\npurposes,--although even here some notion of the magnitude of the\r\nfigures involved may be obtained by considering the average per capita\r\ncost of water in cities where figures are kept, and multiplying this\r\ninto the world population. This calculation would not imply that any\r\nsuch amount is actually paid for water, because the local use of\r\nsprings, wells, and streams can hardly be figured on a cash basis; but,\r\nif human effort the world over in securing the necessary water is about\r\nas efficient as in the average American city, the figures would indicate\r\nthe total money equivalent of this effort.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIGNIFICANCE OF GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF MINERAL PRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe remarkable concentration of the world's mining and smelting around\r\nthe North Atlantic basin, indicated by the foregoing figures, does not\r\nmean that nature has concentrated the mineral deposits here to this\r\nextent. It is an expression rather of the localized application of\r\nenergy to mineral resources by the people of this part of the world. The\r\napplication of the same amount of energy in other parts of the world\r\nwould essentially change the distribution of current mineral production.\r\nThe controlling factor is not the amount of minerals present in the\r\nground; this is known to be large in other parts of the world and more\r\nwill be found when necessary. Controlling factors must be looked for in\r\nhistorical, ethnological, and environmental conditions. This subject is\r\nfurther discussed in the chapters on the several resources, and\r\nparticularly in relation to iron and steel.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INCREASING RATE OF PRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe extraction of mineral resources on the huge scale above indicated is\r\nof comparatively recent date.\r\n\r\nFrom 1880 to the end of 1918 the value of the annual mineral production\r\nof the United States has increased from $367,000,000 to more than\r\n$5,500,000,000, or nearly fifteen times; measured in another way, it has\r\nincreased from a little over $7 per capita to more than $52.[10]\r\n\r\nMore coal has been mined in the United States since 1905 than in all the\r\npreceding history of the country. More iron ore has been mined since\r\n1906 than in all the preceding history. The gold production of the\r\nUnited States practically started with the California gold rush in\r\n1849. The great South African gold production began in 1888. Production\r\nof diamonds in South Africa began about 1869. The large use of all\r\nfertilizer minerals is of comparatively recent date. The world's oil\r\nproduction is greater now each year than it was for any ten years\r\npreceding 1891, and more oil has come out of the ground since 1908 than\r\nin all the preceding history of the world. The use of bauxite on a large\r\nscale as aluminum ore dated practically from the introduction of\r\npatented electrolytic methods of reduction in 1889.\r\n\r\nIn one sense the world has just entered on a gigantic experiment in the\r\nuse of earth materials.\r\n\r\nThe most striking feature of this experiment relates to the vast\r\nacquisition of power indicated by the accelerating rate of production\r\nand consumption of the energy resources--coal, oil, and gas (and water\r\npower). Since 1890 the per capita consumption of coal in the United\r\nStates has trebled and the per capita consumption of oil has become five\r\ntimes as great as it was. If the power from these sources used annually\r\nin recent years be translated roughly into man power, it appears that\r\nevery man, woman, and child in the United States has potential control\r\nof the equivalent of thirty laborers,--as against seven in 1890. Energy\r\nis being released on a scale never before approximated, with\r\nconsequences which we can yet hardly ascertain and appraise. This\r\nconsideration cannot but raise the question as to the ability of modern\r\ncivilization to control and coodinate the dynamic factors in the\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAPITAL VALUE OF WORLD MINERAL RESERVES\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to deduce accurately the capital value of mineral\r\nresources from values of annual output, but again some approximation may\r\nbe made. The profit on the extraction of mineral resources on the whole,\r\nconsidering the cost of exploration, is probably no greater than in\r\nother industries (p. 330). If we assume a 6 per cent return, which\r\nperhaps is somewhere near the world-wide standard of interest rate for\r\nmoney, and capitalize the value of the world's annual output at this\r\nrate, we obtain a world capital value for mineral resources, exclusive\r\nof water, of 150 billions of dollars. This assumes an indefinitely long\r\nlife for reserves. This assumption may need some qualifications, but\r\nit is the writer's view (Chapter XVII) that it is justified for a\r\nsufficiently long period to substantiate the above method of\r\ncalculation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2. Commercial (financial) control of the\r\nmineral resources of the world.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3. Political (territorial) control of the\r\nmineral resources of the world.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL AND COMMERCIAL CONTROL OF MINERAL RESOURCES\r\n\r\nThe occurrence of a mineral resource within a country does not\r\nnecessarily mean control by that particular political unit. A citizen of\r\nthe United States may own a mineral resource in South America.\r\nCommercial control of this sort was demonstrated during the war to be of\r\nmore far-reaching significance than had been supposed, and it became\r\nnecessary to ascertain, not only the output of the different countries,\r\nbut the commercial control of this output. Investigation of this subject\r\nfor twenty-three leading commodities shows that the political and\r\ncommercial control are by no means the same. These are partly summarized\r\nin the accompanying graphs from Spurr.[11] It is to be noted that the\r\ngraphs show the control of many commodities as it existed in 1913, the\r\nlast normal year before the war. Changes during and since the war have\r\nof course largely altered the situation for certain commodities, notably\r\nfor iron, coal, and potash. These developments are summarized in the\r\ndiscussion of the individual resources. It is also to be noted that the\r\ncommercial or financial control of the world's minerals, under the\r\ninfluence of the fostering and protective policies of certain\r\ngovernments discussed in Chapter XVIII, is at present in a state of\r\nflux. Considerable changes are taking place today and are to be looked\r\nfor in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\nRESERVES OF MINERAL RESOURCES\r\n\r\nAnnual production figures are only to a very partial extent an\r\nindication of the distribution of the great reserves of mineral\r\nresources. For instance, there are enormous reserves of coal in China\r\nwhich are not yet utilized to any large extent. The minerals of South\r\nAmerica and Africa are in a very early stage of development. The total\r\nworld reserves will of course not be known until exploration and\r\ndevelopment of the world's resources are complete--a time which will\r\nprobably never come. Figures of reserves represent only our present\r\npartial state of knowledge and are likely to be considerably modified in\r\nthe future. Furthermore, the quantitative accuracy of knowledge of\r\nreserves is so variable in different parts of the world that it is\r\nalmost impossible to make up world figures which have any great\r\nvalidity. There are, however, certain broad facts ascertainable.\r\n\r\nEvery country in the globe is deficient in supplies of some minerals.\r\nThe United States is better off than any other country, but still lacks\r\nmany mineral commodities (see pp. 396-399.) No single continent has\r\nsufficient reserves of all mineral commodities.\r\n\r\nFor the world, however, it may be stated with reasonable certainty that\r\nthe reserves of the principal minerals are now known to be ample with\r\nthe exception of those of oil, tin, and perhaps gold and silver. By\r\n_ample_ we mean sufficient to give no cause for worry for the next few\r\ndecades. For many mineral commodities the amounts now actually in sight\r\nwill not last long, but the possibilities of extension and discovery are\r\nso great that a long future availability of these commodities can be\r\ncounted upon with reasonable safety.\r\n\r\nThe present shortages in oil, tin, and other minerals mentioned may be\r\nonly temporary. There is a large part of the world still to be explored,\r\nand the present reserves merely mark a stage in this exploration.\r\nNevertheless, the ratio of reserves and discovery on the one hand to\r\naccelerated use on the other gives cause for much concern. Looking\r\nforward to the future, the problem of mineral reserves in general is not\r\none of the possible ultimate amount which the earth may\r\ncontain--presumably in no case is this deficient--but of the success\r\nwith which the resource may be found and developed to keep up with the\r\nrapid acceleration of demand. In the chapter on conservation the\r\nsuggestion is made that future difficulties are more likely to arise\r\nfrom failure to coodinate the dynamic factors of supply and demand, than\r\nfrom absolute shortage of material in the earth.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[10] Bastin, Edson S., and McCaskey, H.

Water is so all-pervasive that it is more\r\nor less taken for granted; and so many and so intricate are its\r\nrelations that it is not easy to make an objective survey of the water\r\nproblem in its relation to geology.\r\n\r\nThe original source of water, as well as of air, is in molten magmas\r\ncoming from below. These carry water and gases,--some of which are\r\nreleased and some of which are locked up in the rocks on cooling, to be\r\nlater released during the alterations of the rocks. It is supposed,\r\nwhatever theory of the origin of the earth we favor, that in its early\r\nstages the earth lacked both hydrosphere and atmosphere, and that during\r\nthe growth of the earth these gradually accumulated on and near the\r\nsurface in the manner stated.\r\n\r\nDuring alterations at the surface water is added to the mineral\r\nconstitution of the rocks, and by alterations deep below the surface it\r\nmay be subtracted. Water is the agent through which most mineral and\r\nchemical changes of rocks are accomplished. It is the agent also which\r\nis mainly responsible for the segregation of mineral deposits. Water,\r\nboth as running water and in the solid form of ice, plays an important\r\npart in determining the configuration of the earth's surface. Water is\r\nthe medium in which most sedimentary rocks are formed. It is an\r\nimportant agent in the development of soil and in organic growth. These\r\nvarious influences of water on geological processes touch the economic\r\nfield at many points, especially in relation to the concentration of\r\nores and to the development of soils and surface forms.\r\n\r\nWater comes even more directly into the field of economic geology as a\r\nmineral resource. Water supplies, for the greatest variety of purposes,\r\ninvolve geologic considerations at almost every turn.\r\n\r\nFinally, water may be an aid or a hindrance to excavation and to a great\r\nvariety of structural operations, both in war and in peace; and in this\r\nrelation it again affords geologic problems.\r\n\r\nThe part played by water in geologic processes, such as that of mineral\r\nsegregation, is more or less incidentally discussed in other chapters.\r\nWe may consider more fully in this chapter the application of geology to\r\nthe general subject of water supplies.\r\n\r\nFrom the geological point of view, water is a mineral,--one of the most\r\nimportant of minerals,--as well as a constituent of other minerals. It\r\nbecomes a mineral resource when directly used by man. It is ordinarily\r\nlisted as a mineral resource when shipped and sold as \"mineral water,\"\r\nbut there is obviously no satisfactory line between waters so named and\r\nwater supplies in general, for most of them are used for the same\r\npurposes and none of them are free from mineral matter. Water which is\r\npumped and piped for municipal water supply is as much a mineral\r\nresource as water which is bottled and sold under a trade name. Likewise\r\nwater which is used for irrigation, water power, and a wide variety of\r\nother purposes may logically be considered a mineral resource.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the immense economic importance of water as a mineral\r\nresource its value is more or less taken for granted, and considerations\r\nof valuation and taxation are much less in evidence than in the case of\r\nother mineral resources. Water must be had, regardless of value, and\r\nmarket considerations are to a much less extent a limiting factor.\r\nEconomic applications of geology to this resource are rather more\r\nconfined to matters of exploration, development, total supply, and\r\nconservation, than to attempts to fix money value.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION OF UNDERGROUND WATER\r\n\r\nFree water exists in the openings in rocks where it is sometimes called\r\n_hygroscopic_ water. There is also a large amount of water combined\r\nmolecularly with many of the minerals of rocks, in which form it is\r\ncalled _water of constitution_. This water is fixed in the rock so that\r\nit is not available for use, though some of the processes of rock\r\nalteration liberate it and contribute it to the free water. The\r\nimmediate source of underground water, both free and combined, is mainly\r\nthe surface or rain waters. A subordinate amount may come directly from\r\nigneous emanations or from destruction of certain hydrous minerals.\r\nUltimately, as already indicated, even the surface water originates from\r\nsuch sources.\r\n\r\nThe openings in rocks consist of joints and many other fractures, small\r\nspaces between the grains of rocks (pore space), and amygdaloidal and\r\nother openings characteristic of surface volcanic rocks. Many of these\r\nopenings are capillary and sub-capillary in size. Most rocks, even dense\r\nigneous rocks, are porous in some degree, and certain rocks are porous\r\nin a very high degree. The voids in some surface materials may amount to\r\n84 per cent of the total volume. In general the largest and most\r\ncontinuous openings are near the surface,--where rocks on the whole are\r\nmore largely of the sedimentary type and are more fractured,\r\ndisintegrated, and decomposed, than they are deep within the earth. The\r\nlargest supplies of water are in the unconsolidated sediments. The water\r\nin igneous and other dense rocks is ordinarily in more limited quantity.\r\n\r\nAPPROXIMATE QUANTITY OF WATER WHICH WILL BE ABSORBED BY SOILS AND\r\nROCKS[1]\r\n\r\n  ------------------------------------------------------\r\n                           _Volume of water asborbed\r\n  _Material_                  per 100 of material_\r\n  ------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Sandy soil[2]                      45.4\r\n  Chalk soil[2]                      49.5\r\n  Clay[2]                            50-52.7\r\n  Loam[2]                            45.1-60.1\r\n  Garden earth [2]                   69.0\r\n  Coarse sand [2]                    39.4\r\n  Peat subsoil[2]                    84.0\r\n  Sand                               30-40\r\n  Sandstone                          5-20\r\n  Limestone and dolomite             1-8\r\n  Chalk                              6-27\r\n  Granite                            03.-.8\r\n  ------------------------------------------------------\r\n  1: Mead, Daniel W., _Hydrology_: McGraw-Hill Book Co.,\r\n  New York, 1919, p. 393.\r\n\r\n  2: Woodward, H. B., _Geology of soils and substrata_:\r\n  Edward Arnold, London, 1912.\r\n\r\nImmediately at the surface, the openings of rocks may not be filled with\r\nwater; but below the surface, at distances varying with climatic and\r\ntopographic conditions, the water saturates the openings of the rocks\r\nand forms what is sometimes called the _zone of saturation_ or the _sea\r\nof underground water_. The top surface of this zone is called the _water\r\ntable_, or the _ground-water level_. The space between the water table\r\nand the earth's surface is sometimes referred to as the _vadose zone_ or\r\nthe _zone of weathering_, since it is the belt in which weathering\r\nprocesses are most active. The zone of weathering is not necessarily\r\ndry. Water from the surface enters and sinks through it and water also\r\nrises through it from below; it may contain suspended pockets of water\r\nsurrounded by dry rocks; it is not continuously and fully saturated.\r\n\r\nThe water table or ground-water level may be near or at the surface in\r\nlow and humid areas, and it may be two thousand feet or more below the\r\nsurface in arid regions of high topographic relief. Because of the\r\ninfluence of capillarity, the water table is not a horizontal surface.\r\nIt shows irregularities more or less following the surface contours,\r\nthough not nearly so sharply accentuated.\r\n\r\nThe lower limit of the ground-water is more irregular than the upper\r\nsurface and is less definitely known. In general, openings in rocks tend\r\nto diminish with depth, due to cementation and to closing of cavities by\r\npressures which are too great for the rock to withstand. But rocks\r\ndiffer so widely in their original character, and in their response to\r\nphysical and chemical environment, that it is not unusual to find dense\r\nand impervious rocks above, and open and porous rocks below. The lower\r\nlimit of the zone of abundant underground water varies accordingly. A\r\nwell may encounter nearly dry rock at a comparatively shallow depth, or\r\nit may reach a porous water-bearing stratum at considerable depth. At\r\nthe greater depths pockets of water are sometimes found which have a\r\ncomposition different from that of the surface water, and which\r\nevidently are isolated from the surface water by zones of non-pervious\r\nrock.\r\n\r\nAttempts have been made to calculate the total volume of underground\r\nwater by measuring the openings of rocks and making assumptions as to\r\nthe depth to which such openings may extend. In this manner it has been\r\nestimated that, if all the ground-water were assembled in a single body,\r\nit would make a shell between eighty and two hundred feet thick\r\n(depending on the assumptions) over all the continental areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMOVEMENT OF UNDERGROUND WATER\r\n\r\nAvailability of water supplies is determined by the movement or flow of\r\nwater as well as by its distribution and amount. The natural flow of\r\nwater underground is caused by gravity in the larger openings, but in\r\nthe smaller openings adhesion and capillarity are also important forces.\r\n\r\nOf all the water falling on the surface, some may not go below the\r\nsurface at all but may immediately evaporate or join the runoff--that\r\nis, the surface streams. Another part may penetrate a little distance\r\ninto the zone of weathering and then join the runoff. Of the water which\r\nreaches the zone of saturation, a part may soon come to the surface in\r\nlow areas and join the runoff, and a part may penetrate deeply.\r\n\r\nAbove the zone of saturation gravity carries the water downward in\r\ndevious courses until it reaches the water table. Thereafter its course\r\nis determined largely by the lowest point of escape from the water\r\ntable. In other words, the water table is an irregular surface; and\r\nunder the influence of gravity the water tends to move from the high to\r\nthe low points of this surface. Between the point of entrance and the\r\npoint of escape from the water table, the water follows various courses,\r\ndepending upon the porosity and the openings in the rocks. In general it\r\nfills all of the available openings, and uses the entire available cross\r\nsection in making its progress from one point to another. The difference\r\nin height or the \"head\" between the point of entrance and the point of\r\nescape, together with the porosity of the rock and other factors,\r\ndetermine the general speed of its movement (see p. 73). With equal\r\nporosity the flow is at a maximum along a line directly connecting the\r\ntwo points, and on more devious courses the flow is less.\r\n\r\nThe surface water first enters the ground through innumerable small\r\nopenings. Soon, however, it tends to be concentrated into channels of\r\neasiest flow, with the result that in the later part of its underground\r\ncourse it may be much concentrated in large trunk channels. These\r\nchannels may consist of joints, or frequently of very coarse and\r\npervious beds. The sedimentary rocks as a whole contain the most voids,\r\nand therefore the largest flow and largest supply of water is often\r\nlocalized in them. Of the sedimentary rocks, sandstones and limestones\r\nusually contain the largest and most continuous openings, and thus\r\nafford the freest circulation for water. The voids in fine-grained\r\nshales may equal in volume those in sandstones and limestones, but the\r\nopenings are so small and discontinuous that the water does not flow\r\nfreely. Regardless of total amount of water, unless there are continuous\r\nopenings of some size the flow may be small.\r\n\r\nThe relations of more porous rocks to containing impervious strata also\r\nprofoundly affect the flow of underground water. Between impervious\r\nstrata the circulation may be concentrated and vigorous within the\r\nporous bed. Where the porous bed is not so contained, the movement may\r\nbe more dispersed and less vigorous locally. The inclination of the\r\nbeds, of course, also affects the direction and amount of the flow.\r\n\r\nThe influence of gravity upon underground water may locally tend toward\r\na state of equilibrium in which there is little movement. In such a case\r\nthe water is substantially ponded, and moves only when tapped by\r\nartificial openings.\r\n\r\n\r\nWELLS AND SPRINGS\r\n\r\nUnderground water becomes available for use by means of springs and\r\nthrough wells or bore holes. Water rises to the surface in natural\r\nsprings at points where the pressure or _head_, due to its entrance into\r\nthe ground at a higher level, is sufficient to force it to the surface\r\nafter a longer or shorter underground course. The movement may be all\r\ndownward and lateral to the point of escape, or it may be downward,\r\nlateral, and upward. Ordinarily, the course of spring waters does not\r\ncarry them far below the surface. Heat and gases may be added beneath\r\nthe surface by contact with or contributions from cooling igneous rocks.\r\nThese may accelerate the upward movement of spring waters, and yield\r\nthermal and gas-charged waters, as in the springs and geysers of\r\nYellowstone Park.\r\n\r\nWhen a well is sunk to tap the underground water supply, the water may\r\nnot rise in the artificial opening but may have to be lifted to the\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nIf, however, the water is confined beneath an impervious stratum and is\r\nunder pressure from the water of higher areas, a well opening may simply\r\nallow it to move upward under its own pressure or head. This pressure\r\nmay carry it upward only a few feet or quite to the surface or beyond,\r\nin which latter case the well is called an _artesian_ well. The\r\nessential condition for an artesian circulation is a porous zone,\r\ninclining downward from the surface beneath an impervious stratum which\r\ntends to confine and pond the water. The water at any point in the\r\nwater-bearing rock is under pressure which is more or less equivalent to\r\nthe weight of the column of water determined by the difference in height\r\nbetween this point and the point of entrance or feeding area of the\r\nwater. If the feeding area is higher than the collar of the well, the\r\nwater will rise quite to the surface; if not, it will rise only part\r\nway. Capillary resistance, however, may and usually does lessen the\r\ntheoretical pressure so figured.\r\n\r\nThe flow in deep artesian circulations is ordinarily a slow one. For the\r\nartesian wells of southern Wisconsin, it has been calculated that waters\r\nentering the outcrop of the southward dipping sandstone and limestone\r\nlayers in the northern part of the state have required two or three\r\nhundred years to reach a point in the southern part of the state where\r\nthey are tapped. Because of this slow movement, a large number of wells\r\nin any one spot may exhaust the local supply faster than it is\r\nreplenished from the remainder of the formation. The drilling of\r\nadditional wells near at hand in such cases does not increase the total\r\nyield, but merely divides it among a larger number of wells.\r\n\r\nThe porosity of the rocks, and therefore the flow of an artesian\r\ncirculation, may in some cases be artificially increased by blasting and\r\nshattering.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPOSITION OF UNDERGROUND WATERS\r\n\r\nUnderground waters are never entirely free from dissolved mineral\r\nsubstances, and seldom are they free from suspended particles. Some\r\nwaters are desired because they contain very small quantities of\r\ndissolved mineral matter. Others are prized because they have an\r\nunusually high content of certain mineral substances. In determining the\r\ndeleterious or beneficial effect of dissolved substances, much depends\r\non the purpose for which the water is to be used,--whether for drinking,\r\nwashing, steam boilers, or irrigation. Near the surface underground\r\nwaters may carry bacteria, as well as animal and vegetable refuse,\r\nwhich from a sanitary standpoint are usually objectionable. Deeper\r\nwaters are more likely to lack this contamination because of filtration\r\nthrough rocks and soils.\r\n\r\nThe dissolved mineral substances of underground water are derived for\r\nthe most part from the solution of rocks with which the waters come in\r\ncontact, particularly at or near the surface. Through the agency of\r\nunderground water most of the mineral and chemical changes of rocks are\r\nproduced. The dissolved substances in solution at any time and place may\r\ntherefore be regarded as by-products of rock alterations. Locally they\r\nmay to some extent be derived from direct emanations from cooling\r\nigneous masses.\r\n\r\nThe most common mineral substances contained in waters are lime and\r\nmagnesia. Less common, but abundant locally, are soda, potash, iron, and\r\nsilica. Waters contain also certain acid and gaseous substances, the\r\nmost common of which is carbon dioxide; and less widespread, but locally\r\nabundant, are chlorine and sulphur dioxide. Where lime and magnesia are\r\nabundant the water is ordinarily classed as a hard water. Where absent,\r\nor subordinate to soda and potash, the water is ordinarily classed as a\r\nsoft water. Large amounts of the acid substances like chlorine and\r\nsulphur are detrimental for most purposes. Where there are unusual\r\namounts of carbon dioxide or other gases present, they may by expansion\r\ncause the water to bubble.\r\n\r\nIf we were to attempt to describe and define the characteristics, with\r\nreference to dissolved mineral content and temperature, which make a\r\ngiven water more desirable than another, we should enter a field of the\r\nmost amazing complexity and one with many surprising contradictions. For\r\nthe most widespread use, the most desirable water is a cold water as\r\nfree from mineral content as possible, and especially one lacking an\r\nexcess of lime and magnesia which make it hard; also lacking an excess\r\nof acid constituents like sulphur dioxide, carbon dioxide, or chlorine,\r\nwhich give the water a taste, or which make impossible its use in\r\nboilers. Locally and for special reasons, waters of other qualities are\r\nin demand. Waters so excessively carbonated as to bubble, sulphureted\r\nwaters, chlorine waters, waters high in iron, high in silica, high in\r\npotash, high in soda, or high in magnesia, or waters of high\r\ntemperature, may come to be regarded as desirable. It is an interesting\r\nfact that any water with unusual taste, or unusual mineral content, or\r\nunusual temperature, is likely to be regarded as having medicinal value.\r\nSometimes this view is based on scientific knowledge; sometimes it is an\r\nempirical conclusion based on experience; and again it may be merely\r\nsuperstition. In one case the desirable feature may be the presence of a\r\nlarge amount of carbon dioxide; in another case it may be its absence.\r\nIn one case the desirable feature may be high temperature; in another\r\ncase low temperature. The same combination of qualities which in a\r\ncertain locality may be regarded as highly desirable, may be regarded as\r\nhighly detrimental somewhere else where certain other types of waters\r\nare in vogue.\r\n\r\nProprietary rights and advertising have brought certain waters into use\r\nfor drinking purposes which are not essentially different from more\r\nwidely available waters which are not regarded as having special value.\r\nTwo springs located side by side, or a spring and a deep well, whose\r\nwaters have exactly the same chemical characteristics, may be used and\r\nvalued on entirely different scales. Any attempt to classify mineral\r\nwaters sold to the public in any scientific way discloses a most\r\nintricate and confused situation. One can only conclude that the\r\npopularity of certain waters is not based alone on objective qualities\r\nof composition, but rather on causes which lie in the fields of\r\npsychology and commerce.\r\n\r\nThe part played by sentiment in putting value on water is well\r\nillustrated by the general preference for spring waters as compared with\r\nwell waters. In the public mind, \"spring water\" denotes water of unusual\r\npurity and of more desirable mineral content than well water.\r\nIllustrations could be cited of districts in which the surface or spring\r\nwaters have a composition not different from that of the deeper well\r\nwaters, and are much more likely to be contaminated because of proximity\r\nto the surface; and yet people will pay considerable sums for the spring\r\nwater in preference to the cheaply available well water.\r\n\r\n\r\nRELATION OF GEOLOGY TO UNDERGROUND WATER SUPPLY\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that a knowledge of geology is helpful in locating an\r\nunderground water supply. Locally the facts may become so well known\r\nempirically that the well driller is able to get satisfactory results\r\nwithout using anything but the crudest geologic knowledge; but in\r\ngeneral, attention to geologic considerations tends to eliminate\r\nfailures in well drilling and to insure a more certain and satisfactory\r\nwater supply.\r\n\r\nIn drilling for water, it is essential to know the nature, succession,\r\nand structure of the rocks beneath the surface in order to be able to\r\nidentify and correlate them from drill samples. The mere identification\r\nof samples is often sufficient to determine whether a well has been\r\ndrilled far enough or too far to secure the maximum results. In order to\r\narrive at any advance approximation of results for a given locality, a\r\nknowledge of the general geology of the entire region may be necessary.\r\nEspecially for expensive deep artesian wells it is necessary to work out\r\nthe geologic possibilities well in advance. It is useless, for instance,\r\nto look for artesian water in a granite; but in an area of gently\r\ninclined strata, with alternations of porous and impervious layers, the\r\nexpert may often figure with a considerable degree of certainty the\r\ndepth at which a given porous stratum will be found, and the pressure\r\nunder which the water will be in this particular stratum at a given\r\npoint. Even the mineral content of the water may in some cases be\r\npredicted from geologic study.\r\n\r\nOne of the most obvious and immediately useful services of the geologist\r\nin most localities is the collection and preservation of well samples\r\nfor purposes of identification and correlation of rock formations, and\r\nas a guide to further drilling. Failure to preserve samples has often\r\nled to useless and expensive duplication of work.\r\n\r\nThe problem of water supply in some localities is comparatively simple\r\nand easy. In other areas there is an infinite variety of geologic\r\nconditions which affect the problem, and the geologist finds it\r\nnecessary to bring to bear all the scientific knowledge of any sort\r\nwhich can be used,--particularly knowledge in relation to the type of\r\nrock, the stratigraphy and the structure.\r\n\r\n\r\nSURFACE WATER SUPPLIES\r\n\r\nWhere underground water is not abundant or not cheaply available, or\r\nwhere larger amounts of water are needed, as in large cities or for\r\nirrigation purposes, surface water is used. In general, surface waters\r\nare more likely to be contaminated by vegetable and animal matter and\r\nto require purification for drinking purposes.\r\n\r\nSurface waters are also used for irrigation, water power, drainage, the\r\ncarrying of sewage, etc. This great variety of uses brings the\r\nconsideration of surface waters into many fields other than geology, but\r\nan understanding and interpretation of the geological conditions is none\r\nthe less fundamental. This is evidenced by the inclusion of geologic\r\ndiscussions in most textbooks of hydrology, and in the reports of the\r\nHydrographic Branch of the U. S. Geological Survey. The very fact that\r\nthis important branch of governmental investigation is in a charge of\r\nthe U. S. Geological Survey indicates its close relation to geology.\r\n\r\nThe principles of geology used in the study of surface waters relate\r\nchiefly to physiography (see Chapter I). It is usually necessary to know\r\nthe total quantity of flow, its annual and seasonal variation, and the\r\npossible methods of equalization or concentration; the maximum quantity\r\nof flow, the variation during periods of flood, and the possibilities of\r\nreduction or control; the minimum flow and its possible modification by\r\nstorage or an auxiliary supply. These questions are obviously related to\r\nthe size and shape of the catchment area, the topography, the rock\r\nstructure, the relation between underground flow or absorption and the\r\nrunoff, and other physiographic factors. Quoting from D. W. Mead:[12]\r\n\r\n     Geological conditions are frequently of great importance in\r\n     their influence on the quantity and regularity of runoff. If\r\n     the geological deposits of the drainage area are highly\r\n     impervious, the surface flow will receive and transmit the\r\n     water into the mass only through the cracks and fissures in\r\n     the rock. Pervious materials, such as sandstones, sands,\r\n     gravels, and cracked or fissured rocks, induce seepage, retard\r\n     runoff, and, if such deposits are underlaid with an impervious\r\n     bed, provide underground storage which impounds water away\r\n     from the conditions which permit evaporation, and hence tends\r\n     to increase runoff and equalize flow. On the other hand, if\r\n     such pervious deposits possess other outlets outside of the\r\n     stream channel and drainage area, they may result in the\r\n     withdrawal of more or less of the seepage waters entirely from\r\n     the ultimate flow of the stream. Coarse sands and gravels\r\n     will rapidly imbibe the rainfall into their structure. Fine\r\n     and loose beds of sand also rapidly receive and transmit the\r\n     rainfall unless the precipitation is exceedingly heavy under\r\n     which conditions some of it may flow away on the surface.\r\n\r\n     Many of the highly pervious indurated formations receive water\r\n     slowly and require a considerable time of contact in order to\r\n     receive and remove the maximum amount.\r\n\r\n     In flat, pervious areas, rainfalls of a certain intensity are\r\n     frequently essential to the production of any resulting stream\r\n     flow. In a certain Colorado drainage area, the drainage\r\n     channel is normally dry except after a rainfall of one-half\r\n     inch or more. A less rainfall, except under the condition of a\r\n     previously saturated area, evaporates and sinks through the\r\n     soil and into the deep lying pervious sand rock under the\r\n     surface which transmits it beyond the drainage area. Such\r\n     results are frequently greatly obscured by the interference of\r\n     other factors, such as temperature, vegetation, etc.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     The natural storage of any drainage area and the possibilities\r\n     of artificial storage depend principally upon its topography\r\n     and geology. Storage equalizes flow, although the withdrawal\r\n     of precipitation by snow or ice storage in northern areas\r\n     often reduces winter flow to the minimum for the year. Both\r\n     surface and sub-surface storage sometimes hold the water from\r\n     the streams at times when it might be advantageously used.\r\n     Storage, while essential to regulation, is not always an\r\n     advantage to immediate flow conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNDERGROUND AND SURFACE WATERS IN RELATION TO EXCAVATION AND CONSTRUCTION\r\n\r\nScarcely more than a mention of this subject is necessary. In mining,\r\nthe pumping charge is one of the great factors of cost. A forecast of\r\nthe amount and flow of water to be encountered in mining is based on the\r\ngeologic conditions. The same is true in excavating tunnels, canals, and\r\ndeep foundations. Detailed study of the amount and nature of water in\r\nthe rock and soil of the Panama Canal has been vital to a knowledge of\r\nthe cause and possibilities of prevention of slides. Rock slides in\r\ngeneral are closely related to the amount and distribution of the water\r\ncontent.\r\n\r\nThe importance of ground-water as a detriment in military operations was\r\nshown during the recent war in trenching and other field works. At the\r\noutset, with the possible exception of the German army, a lack of\r\nscientific study of ground-water conditions led to much unnecessary\r\ndifficulty. It soon became necessary to study and map the water\r\nconditions in great detail in advance of operations. Much of this work\r\nwas done by geologists (see Chapter XIX).\r\n\r\nGeological considerations are involved in a great variety of engineering\r\nundertakings related to river and harbor improvements, dam sites, etc.,\r\nmentioned in Chapter XX.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[12] Mead, Daniel W., _Hydrology_: McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York, 1919,\r\npp. 447-448, 456.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE COMMON ROCKS AND SOILS AS MINERAL RESOURCES\r\n\r\n\r\nECONOMIC FEATURES OF THE COMMON ROCKS\r\n\r\nUnder the general heading of common rocks are included the ordinary\r\nigneous, sedimentary, and \"metamorphic\" rocks, and the unconsolidated\r\nclays, sands, and gravels characteristic of surface conditions, which\r\nare mined and quarried for commercial use. Soils are closely related to\r\nthis group; but since they present special problems of their own, they\r\nare discussed under a separate heading at the end of the chapter. Names\r\nof the common rocks will be used with the general commercial\r\nsignificance given them by the United States Geological Survey in its\r\nmineral resource reports.\r\n\r\nBecause of their inexhaustible quantity and ready availability, the\r\nvalue of the common rock products is not large per unit of weight; but\r\nin the aggregate it ranks high among mineral products. In respect to\r\ntonnage, common rocks constitute perhaps 10 per cent of the world annual\r\noutput of all mineral commodities (exclusive of water).\r\n\r\nThe greater tonnage of the common rocks is used commercially in crushed\r\nor comminuted forms for road material, for railroad ballast, and for\r\ncement, brick, concrete, and flux. In blocks and structural shapes, of\r\nless aggregate tonnage, they are used as building stone, monumental\r\nstone, paving blocks, curbing, flagging, roofing, refractory stone, and\r\nfor many other building and manufacturing purposes.\r\n\r\nThe common rocks are commodities in which most countries of the globe\r\nare self-sufficing. International trade in these commodities is\r\ninsignificant, being confined to small quantities of materials for\r\nspecial purposes, or to local movements of short distances, allowed by\r\ngood transportation facilities.\r\n\r\nThe common rocks are so abundant and widespread that the conservation\r\nof raw materials is not ordinarily a vital problem. Conservational\r\nprinciples do apply, however, to the human energy factor required for\r\ntheir efficient use. In the valuation of common rocks, also, the more\r\nimportant factors are not the intrinsic qualities of the stones, but\r\nrather the conditions of their availability for use.\r\n\r\nBecause of bulk and comparatively low intrinsic value, the principal\r\ncommercial factors in the availability of the common rocks are\r\ntransportation and ease of quarrying, but these are by no means the only\r\nfactors determining availability. Their mineral and chemical\r\ncomposition, their texture and structure, their durability, their\r\nbehavior under pressure and temperature changes, and other factors enter\r\nin to important degrees. The weighting and integration of these factors,\r\nfor the purpose of reaching conclusions as to the availability of\r\nparticular rock materials, depend also on the purposes for which these\r\nmaterials are to be used. The problem is anything but simple. The search\r\nfor a particular rock to meet a certain demand within certain limits of\r\ncost is often a long and arduous one. On account of the abundance and\r\nwidespread distribution of common rocks and their variety of uses, there\r\nis a good deal of popular misapprehension as to their availability. Many\r\nbuilding and manufacturing enterprises have met disastrous checks,\r\nbecause of a tendency to assume availability of stone without making the\r\nfullest technical investigation. Many quarrying ventures have come to\r\ngrief for the same reason. It is easy to assume that, because a granite\r\nin a certain locality is profitably quarried and used, some other\r\ngranite in the same locality has equal chances. However, minor\r\ndifferences in structure, texture, and composition, or in costs of\r\nquarrying and transportation, may make all the difference between profit\r\nand loss. Even though all these conditions are satisfactorily met,\r\nbuilders and users are often so conservative that a new product finds\r\ndifficulty in breaking into the market. A well-established building or\r\nornamental stone, or a limestone used for flux, may hold the market for\r\nyears in the face of competition from equally good and cheaper supplies.\r\nThe very size of a quarry undertaking may determine its success or\r\nfailure.\r\n\r\n\r\nGRANITE\r\n\r\nThe term granite, as used commercially, includes true granite and such\r\nallied rocks as syenite and gneiss. In fact even quartzite is sometimes\r\ncalled granite in commerce, as in the case of the Baraboo quartzites of\r\nWisconsin, but this is going too far. For statistical purposes, the\r\nUnited States Geological Survey has also included small quantities of\r\ndiorite and gabbro. The principal uses of granite are, roughly in order\r\nof importance, for monumental stone, building stone, crushed stone,\r\npaving, curbing, riprap and rubble. Thirty states in the United States\r\nproduce granite, the leaders being Vermont, Massachusetts, North\r\nCarolina, Maine, Wisconsin, Minnesota, and California.\r\n\r\n\r\nBASALT AND RELATED TYPES\r\n\r\nBasalt and related rocks are sometimes included under the name \"trap\r\nrock,\" which comprises,--besides typical basalt and diabase,--fine-grained\r\ndiorite, gabbro, and other basic rocks, which are less common in\r\noccurrence and are similar in chemical and physical properties. The\r\nprincipal use of these rocks is as crushed stone for road and ballast\r\npurposes and for concrete. They are produced in some fifteen states, the\r\nleaders being New Jersey, Pennsylvania, California, and Connecticut.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIMESTONE, MARL, CHALK\r\n\r\nIn the United States limestone is used principally as crushed stone for\r\nroad material, railroad ballast, concrete, and cement, as fluxing stone\r\nfor metallurgical purposes, and in the manufacture of lime. Minor uses\r\nare as building stones, paving blocks, curbing, flagging, rubble, and\r\nriprap; in alkali works, sugar factories, paper mills, and glass works;\r\nand for agricultural purposes. For the making of cement, in\r\nmetallurgical fluxes, and in most of the manufacturing and agricultural\r\nuses, both limestone and lime (limestone with the CO_2 driven out by\r\nheating) are used. Lime is also extensively used in the making of mortar\r\nfor building operations, in tanning leather, and in a great variety of\r\nchemical industries. The total quantity of limestone used for all\r\npurposes in the United States nearly equals that of iron ore. Nearly\r\nevery state in the union produces limestone, but the more important\r\nproducers are Pennsylvania (where a large amount is used for fluxing),\r\nOhio, Indiana, New York, Michigan, and Illinois.\r\n\r\nClosely associated with limestone in commercial uses, as well as in\r\nchemical composition, is calcareous marl, which is used extensively in\r\nthe manufacture of Portland cement.\r\n\r\nChalk is a soft amorphous substance of the same composition as\r\nlimestone. The main uses of chalk are as a filler in rubber, and as a\r\ncomponent of paint and putty. It is also used for polishing. The\r\nprincipal producers of this commodity are England, Denmark, and France,\r\nand the chief consumer is the United States. The United States depends\r\nupon imports for its supply of chalk for the manufacture of whiting.\r\nBefore the war two-thirds came from England and a third from France.\r\nDuring the war importation was confined to England, with a small tonnage\r\nfrom Denmark. No deposits of domestic chalk have been exploited\r\ncommercially. A somewhat inferior whiting, but one capable of being\r\nsubstituted for chalk in most cases, is manufactured from the waste fine\r\nmaterial of limestone and marble quarries.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARBLE\r\n\r\nMarble is limestone which has been coarsely recrystallized by\r\nmetamorphism. The marble of commerce includes a small quantity of\r\nserpentine as quarried and sold in Massachusetts, California, Maryland,\r\nPennsylvania, and Vermont, and also a small amount of so-called onyx\r\nmarble or travertine obtained from caves and other deposits in Kentucky\r\nand other states. The principal uses of marble are for building and\r\nmonumental stones. Of the twenty-two states producing marble, the\r\nleaders are Vermont, Georgia, and Tennessee.\r\n\r\nA small amount of marble of special beauty, adapted to ornamental\r\npurposes, is imported from European countries, especially from Italy.\r\nMarble imports from Italy constitute about two-thirds, both in tonnage\r\nand value, of all stone imported into the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAND, SANDSTONE, QUARTZITE (AND QUARTZ)\r\n\r\nSand is composed mainly of particles of quartz or silica, though\r\nsometimes feldspar and other minerals are present. Sandstones are\r\npartially cemented sands. Quartzites are completely cemented sands. To\r\nsome extent these substances are used interchangeably for the same\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nThe principal uses of sand in order of commercial totals are for\r\nbuilding purposes--for mortar, concrete, sand-lime brick, etc.,--as\r\nmolding sand in foundries, as a constituent of glass, in grinding and\r\npolishing, in paving, as engine sand, as fire or furnace sand, in the\r\nmanufacture of ferrosilicon (a steel alloy), and in filters. Reference\r\nis made to sand as an abrasive and in the manufacture of steel in\r\nChapters XIII and IX. Almost every state produces some sand, but for\r\nsome of the more specialized uses, such as glass sand, molding sand, and\r\nfire or furnace sand, the distribution is more or less limited. The\r\nUnited States Geological Survey has collected information concerning the\r\ndistribution of various kinds of sand and gravel, and serves a very\r\nuseful function in furnishing data as to supplies of material for\r\nparticular purposes. Fine molding sands have been imported from France,\r\nbut during the war domestic sources in New York and Ohio were developed\r\nsufficiently to meet any requirements.\r\n\r\nThe sandstone of commerce includes the quartzites of Minnesota, South\r\nDakota, and Wisconsin, and the fine-grained sandstones of New York,\r\nPennsylvania, and elsewhere, known to the trade as \"bluestone.\" In\r\nKentucky most of the sandstone quarried is known locally as \"freestone.\"\r\nThe principal uses of sandstone are for building stone, crushed stone,\r\nand ganister (for silica brick and furnace-linings). Other uses are for\r\npaving blocks, curbing, flagging, riprap, rubble, grindstones,\r\nwhetstones, and pulpstones (see also Chapter XIII). Sandstone is\r\nsometimes crushed into sand and is used in the manufacture of glass and\r\nas molding-sand. Most of the states of the union produce sandstone, the\r\nprincipal producers being Pennsylvania, Ohio, and New York.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"SAND AND GRAVEL\"\r\n\r\nWhere sand is coarse and impure and mixed with pebbles, it is Ordinarily\r\nreferred to as \"sand and gravel.\" For sand and gravel the principal\r\nuses are for railroad ballast, for road building, and for concrete. Sand\r\nand gravel are produced in almost every state in the union, the largest\r\nproducers being Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois, New Jersey, and North\r\nCarolina.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLAY, SHALE, SLATE\r\n\r\nShale is consolidated clay, usually with a fine lamination due to\r\nbedding. Slate is a more dense and crystalline rock, produced usually by\r\nthe anamorphism of clay or shale under pressure, and characterized by a\r\nfine cleavage which is usually inclined to the sedimentary bedding.\r\n\r\nClays are used principally for building and paving brick and tile,\r\nsewer-pipe, railroad ballast, road material, puddle, Portland cement,\r\nand pottery. Clay is mined in almost every state. Ohio, Pennsylvania,\r\nNew Jersey, and Illinois have the largest production. There has been a\r\nconsiderable importation of high-grade clays, principally from England,\r\nfor special purposes--such as the filling and coating of paper; the\r\nmanufacture of china, of porcelain for electrical purposes, and of\r\ncrucibles; and for use in ultramarine pigments, in sanitary ware, in\r\noilcloth, and as fillers in cotton bleacheries. War experience showed\r\nthe possibility of substitution of domestic clays for most of these\r\nuses; but results were not in all cases satisfactory, and the United\r\nStates will doubtless continue to use imported clays for some of these\r\nspecial purposes.\r\n\r\nShales, because of their thinly bedded character and softness, are of no\r\nvalue as building stones, but are used in the manufacture of brick,\r\ntile, pottery, and Portland cement.\r\n\r\nSlates owe their commercial value primarily to their cleavage, which\r\ngives well-defined planes of splitting. The principal uses are for\r\nroofing and, in the form of so-called mill stock for sanitary,\r\nstructural, and electrical purposes. Small amounts are used for\r\ntombstones, roads, slate granules for patent roofing, school slates,\r\nblackboard material, billiard table material, etc. The color, fineness\r\nof the cleavage, and size of the flakes are the principal features\r\ndetermining the use of any particular slate. Ten states produce slate,\r\nthe principal production coming from Pennsylvania and Vermont.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FELDSPARS\r\n\r\nFeldspars are minerals, not rocks, but mention of them is made here\r\nbecause, with quartz, they make up such an overwhelming percentage of\r\nearth materials. It is estimated that the feldspars make up 50 per cent\r\nof all the igneous rocks and 16 per cent of the sedimentary rocks. As\r\nthe igneous rocks are so much more abundant than the sedimentary rocks,\r\nthe percentage of feldspars in the earth approaches the former rather\r\nthan the latter figure. In most rocks feldspar is in too small grains\r\nand is too intimately associated with other minerals to be of commercial\r\nimportance; in only one type of rock, pegmatite, which is an igneous\r\nrock of extremely coarse and irregular texture, are the feldspar\r\ncrystals sufficiently large and concentrated to be commercially\r\navailable.\r\n\r\nFeldspar is used principally in the manufacture of pottery, china ware,\r\nporcelain, enamel ware, and enamel brick and tile. In the body of these\r\nproducts it is used to lower the fusing point of the other ingredients\r\nand to form a firm bond between their particles. Its use in forming the\r\nglaze of ceramic products is also due to its low melting point. A less\r\nwidespread use of feldspar is as an abrasive (Chapter XIII). One of the\r\nvarieties of feldspar carries about 15 per cent of potash, and because\r\nof the abundance of the mineral there has been much experimental work to\r\nascertain the possibility of separating potash for fertilizer purposes;\r\nbut, because of cost, this source of potash is not likely for a long\r\ntime to compete with the potash salts already concentrated by nature.\r\n\r\nFeldspar is mined in eleven states, but the important production comes\r\nfrom North Carolina and Maine. The United States also imports some\r\nfeldspar from Canada.\r\n\r\n\r\nHYDRAULIC CEMENT (including Portland, natural, and Puzzolan cements)\r\n\r\nCement is a manufactured product made from limestone (or marl) and clay\r\n(or shale). Sometimes these two kinds of substances are so combined in\r\nnature (as in certain clayey limestones) that they are available for\r\ncement manufacture without artificial mixing. It is not our purpose in\r\nthis volume to discuss manufactured products; but the cement industry\r\ninvolves such a simple transformation of raw materials, and is so\r\nclosely localized by the distribution of the raw materials, that a\r\nmention of some of its outstanding features seems desirable.\r\n\r\nHydraulic cement is used almost exclusively as a structural material. It\r\nis an essential ingredient of concrete. Originally used chiefly for the\r\nbonding of brick and stone masonry and for foundation work, its uses\r\nhave grown rapidly, especially with the introduction of reinforced\r\nconcrete. It is being used in the construction of roads, and its latest\r\nuse is in ship construction.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of satisfactory fuels, the raw materials required for\r\nthe manufacture of cement are found quite generally throughout the\r\nworld. While practically all countries produce some cement, much of it\r\nof natural grade, only the largest producers make enough for their own\r\nrequirements and as a result there is a large world movement of this\r\ncommodity. The world trade is chiefly in Portland cement.\r\n\r\nNext to the United States, the producing countries having the largest\r\nexportable surplus of cement in normal times are Germany and Great\r\nBritain. France and Belgium were both large producers and exporters\r\nbefore the war, but the war greatly reduced their capacity to produce\r\nfor the time being. Sweden, Denmark, Austria, Japan, and Switzerland all\r\nproduce less extensively but have considerable surplus available for\r\nexport. Italy and Spain have large productions, which are about\r\nsufficient for their own requirements. Holland and Russia import large\r\namounts from the other European countries. The far eastern trade absorbs\r\nthe excess production of Japan. In South Africa and Australasia,\r\nproduction nearly equals demand. In Canada, although the industry has\r\nbeen growing very rapidly, the demand still exceeds production. In South\r\nand Central America, Mexico and the West Indies, the demand is\r\nconsiderable and will probably increase; production has thus far been\r\ninsufficient. Several modern mills are either recently completed or\r\nunder construction in these countries, and concessions have been granted\r\nfor several others. These new mills are largely financed by American\r\ncapital.\r\n\r\nThe United States is the largest single producer of cement in the world,\r\nits annual production being about 45 per cent of the world's total.\r\nDomestic consumption has always been nearly as great as the production,\r\nand exports have usually not exceeded 4 per cent of the total shipments\r\nfrom the mills. South and Central America offer fields for exportation\r\nof cement from the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGIC FEATURES OF THE COMMON ROCKS\r\n\r\nTo describe the geologic features of the common rocks used in commerce\r\nwould require a full treatise on the subject of geology. These are the\r\nbulk materials of the earth and in them we read the geologic history of\r\nthe earth. In preceding chapters a brief outline has been given of the\r\nrelative abundance of the common earth materials and of the processes\r\nproducing them. In comparison, the metalliferous deposits are the merest\r\nincidents in the development of this great group of mineral resources.\r\n\r\nIn this section reference will be made only to a few of the rock\r\nqualities and other geologic features which require first attention in\r\ndetermining the availability of a common rock for commercial use. The\r\nlist is very fragmentary, for the reason that the uses are so many and\r\nso varied that to describe all the geologic features which are important\r\nfrom the standpoint of all uses would very soon bring the discussion far\r\nbeyond the confines of a book of this scope.[13]\r\n\r\n\r\nBUILDING STONE\r\n\r\nFor building stones, the principal geologic features requiring attention\r\nare structure, durability, beauty, and coloring.\r\n\r\nThe structures of a rock include jointing, sedimentary stratification,\r\nand secondary cleavage. Nearly all rocks are jointed. The joints may be\r\nopen and conspicuous, or closed and almost imperceptible. The closed\r\njoints or incipient joints cause planes of weakness, known variously as\r\nrift, grain, etc., which largely determine the shapes of the blocks\r\nwhich may be extracted from a quarry. Where properly distributed, they\r\nmay facilitate the quarrying of the stone. In other cases they may be\r\ninjurious, in that they limit the size of the blocks which can be\r\nextracted and afford channels for weathering agents. Some rocks of\r\notherwise good qualities are so cut by joints that they are useless for\r\nanything but crushed stone. The bedding planes or stratification of\r\nsedimentary rocks exercise influences similar to joints, and like\r\njoints may be useful or disadvantageous, depending on their spacing. The\r\nsecondary cleavage of some rocks, notably slates, enables them to be\r\nsplit into flat slabs and thus makes them useful for certain purposes.\r\n\r\nProper methods of extraction and use of a rock may minimize the\r\ndisadvantageous effects of its structural features. The use of\r\nchannelling machines instead of explosives means less shattering of the\r\nrock. By proper dressing of the surface the opening of small crevices\r\nmay be avoided. Stratified rocks set on bed, so that the bedding planes\r\nare horizontal, last longer than if set on edge.\r\n\r\nThe durability of a rock may depend on its perviousness to water which\r\nmay enter along planes of bedding or incipient fracture planes, or along\r\nthe minute pore spaces between the mineral particles. The water may\r\ncause disastrous chemical changes in the minerals and by its freezing\r\nand thawing may cause splitting. For this reason, the less pervious\r\nrocks have in general greater durability than the more pervious. Highly\r\npervious rocks used in a dry position or in a dry climate will last\r\nlonger than elsewhere.\r\n\r\nDurability is determined also by the different coefficients of expansion\r\nof the constituent minerals of the rock. Where the minerals are\r\nheterogeneous in this regard, differential stresses are more likely to\r\nbe set up than where the minerals are homogeneous. Likewise a\r\ncoarse-textured rock is in general less durable than a fine-textured\r\none. Expansion and contraction of a stone under ordinary temperature\r\nchanges, and also under fire and freezing, must necessarily be known for\r\nmany kinds of construction.\r\n\r\nMinerals resist weathering to different degrees, therefore the mineral\r\ncomposition of a rock is another considerable factor in determining its\r\ndurability. Where pyrite is present in abundance it easily weathers out,\r\nleaving iron-stained pits and releasing sulphuric acid which decomposes\r\nthe rock. Abundance of mica, especially where segregated along the\r\nstratification planes, permits easy splitting of the rock under\r\nweathering. Likewise the mica often weathers more quickly than the\r\nsurrounding minerals, giving a pitted appearance; in marbles and\r\nlimestones its irregular occurrence may spoil the appearance. Flint or\r\nchert in abundance is deleterious to limestones and marbles, because,\r\nbeing more resistant, it stands out in relief on the weathered surface,\r\ninterferes with smooth cutting and polishing, and often causes the rock\r\nto split along the lines of the flint concretions. Abundance of\r\ntremolite may also be disadvantageous to limestones and marbles, because\r\nit weathers to a greenish-yellow clay and leaves a pitted surface.\r\n\r\nThe crushing strength of a rock has an obvious relation to its\r\nstructural uses. The rock must be strong enough for the specified load.\r\nMost hard rocks ordinarily considered for building purposes are strong\r\nenough for the loads to which subjected, and this factor is perhaps\r\nordinarily less important than the structural and mineral features\r\nalready mentioned.\r\n\r\nIt is often necessary to know the modulus of elasticity and other\r\nmechanical constants of a rock, as in cases where it is to be combined\r\nwith metal or other masonry or to be subjected to exceptional shock.\r\n\r\nThe beauty and coloring of a rock are its esthetic rather than its\r\nutilitarian features. They are particularly important in the\r\nconstruction of buildings and monuments for public or ornamental\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\n\r\nCRUSHED STONE\r\n\r\nThe largest use of rock or stone is in the crushed form for road\r\nbuilding, railway embankments, and concrete, and the prospect is for\r\nlargely increased demands for such uses in the future. For the purpose\r\nof road building, it is necessary to consider a stone's resistance to\r\nabrasion, hardness, toughness, cementing value, absorption, and specific\r\ngravity. Limestone cements well, but in other qualities it is not\r\ndesirable for heavy traffic. Shales are soft and clayey, and grind down\r\nto a mass which is dry and powdery, and muddy in wet weather. Basalt and\r\nrelated rocks resist abrasion, and cement well. Granites and other\r\ncoarse-grained igneous rocks do not cement well and are not resistant to\r\nabrasion. Many sandstones are very hard and brittle and resist abrasion,\r\nbut do not cement.\r\n\r\nThe application of geology on a large scale to the study of sources and\r\nqualities of crushed stone is now being required in connection with the\r\ngreat state and national projects of highway building. This work is by\r\nno means confined to a mere testing of the physical qualities of\r\nroad-building materials found along the proposed route, but includes a\r\ncareful study of their geologic occurrence, distribution, and probable\r\namounts. In certain of the northern states specialists in glacial\r\ngeology are preferred for this purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTONE FOR METALLURGICAL PURPOSES\r\n\r\nThe use of limestone and other rock for metallurgical fluxes is\r\ndependent very largely on chemical composition. Comparatively few\r\nlimestones are sufficiently pure for this purpose. For furnace linings,\r\nthe quartzite or ganister must be exceptionally pure. The field search\r\nfor rocks of the necessary composition has required geologic service.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLAY\r\n\r\nFor a variety of uses to which clay is put, it is necessary to know its\r\ndegree of plasticity, tensile strength, shrinkage (both under air and\r\nfire), fusibility, color, specific gravity, and chemical properties. The\r\ntesting of clay for its various possible uses is a highly specialized\r\njob, usually beyond the range of a geologist, although certain\r\ngeologists have been leaders in this type of investigation. More\r\ncommonly within the range of a geologist are questions concerning\r\norigin, field classification, distribution, quantities, and other\r\ngeologic conditions affecting quality and production.\r\n\r\nClay originates from the weathering of common rocks containing\r\nsilicates, by pretty well understood weathering processes (see Chapter\r\nII). It may remain in place above the parent rock, or may be transported\r\nand redeposited, either on land or under water, by the agencies of air,\r\nwater, and ice. The kind of parent rock, the climatic conditions and\r\nnature of the weathering, and the degree of sorting during\r\ntransportation, all determine the composition and texture of the\r\nresulting clay,--with the result that a classification on the basis of\r\norigin may indicate the broad group characteristics which it is\r\ndesirable to know for commercial purposes. For instance, residual clays\r\nfrom the weathering of granite may be broadly contrasted with residual\r\nclays formed by the weathering of limestone, and both differ in group\r\ncharacteristics from clays in glacial deposits. Classification according\r\nto origin also may be useful in indicating general features of depth,\r\nquantity, and distribution. However, a genetic classification of clays\r\nis often not sufficient to indicate the precise characteristics which\r\nit is necessary to know in determining their availability for narrow and\r\nspecial technical requirements. Furthermore, clays suitable for certain\r\ncommercial requirements may be formed in several different ways, and\r\nclassification based on specific qualities may therefore not correspond\r\nat all to geologic classification based on origin.\r\n\r\nGeologists have been especially interested in the causes of plasticity\r\nof clay and in its manner of hardening when dried. In general these\r\nphenomena have been found to be due to content of colloidal substances\r\nof a clayey nature, which serve not only to hold the substance together\r\nduring plastic flow but to bind it during drying. The part played by\r\ncolloids in the formation of clays, as well as of many other mineral\r\nproducts, is now a question which is receiving intensive study.\r\n\r\nThe same processes which produce clay also produce, under special\r\nconditions, iron ores, bauxites, the oxide zones of many sulphide ore\r\nbodies, and soils, all of which are referred to on other pages.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIMITATIONS OF GEOLOGIC FIELD IN COMMERCIAL INVESTIGATION OF COMMON ROCKS\r\n\r\nIn general the qualities of the earth materials which determine their\r\navailability for use are only to a minor extent the qualities which the\r\ngeologist ordinarily considers for mapping and descriptive purposes. The\r\nusual geological map and report on a district indicate the distribution\r\nand general nature of the common rocks, and also the extent to which\r\nthey are being used as mineral resources. Seldom, however, is there\r\nadded a sufficiently precise description, for instance of a clay, to\r\nenable the reader to determine which, if any, of the many different uses\r\nthe material might be put to. The variety of uses is so great, and the\r\ntechnical requirements for different purposes are so varied and so\r\nvariable, that it is almost impossible to make a description which is\r\nsufficiently comprehensive, and at the same time sufficiently exact, to\r\ngive all the information desired for economic purposes. If the geologist\r\nis interested in disclosing the commercial possibilities in the raw\r\nmaterials of an area, he may select some of the more promising features\r\nand subject them to the technical analysis necessary to determine their\r\navailability for special uses. In this phase of his work he may find it\r\nnecessary to enlist the cooperation of skilled technicians and\r\nlaboratories in the various special fields. The problem is simplified if\r\nthe geologist is hunting for a particular material for a specific\r\npurpose, for then he fortifies himself with a knowledge of the\r\nparticular qualities needed and directs his field and laboratory study\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\nToo often the geologist fails to recognize the complexity and\r\ndefiniteness of the qualities required, and makes statements and\r\nrecommendations on the use of raw materials based on somewhat general\r\ngeologic observations. On the other hand, the engineer, or the\r\nmanufacturer, or the builder often goes wrong and spends money\r\nneedlessly, by failing to take into consideration general geologic\r\nfeatures which may be very helpful in determining the distribution,\r\namount, and general characters of the raw materials needed.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to draw the line between the proper fields of the\r\ngeologist and those of the engineer, the metallurgist, and other\r\ntechnicians. It is highly desirable that the specialist in any one of\r\nthese fields know at least of the existence of the other fields and\r\nsomething of their general nature. Too often his actions indicate he is\r\nnot acutely conscious even of the existence of these related branches of\r\nknowledge. The extent and detail to which the geologist will familiarize\r\nhimself with these other fields will of course vary with his training\r\nand the circumstances of his work. Whatever his limit is, it should be\r\ndefinitely recognized; his work should be thorough up to this limit and\r\nhis efforts should not be wasted in fields which he is not best\r\nqualified to investigate.\r\n\r\nThese remarks apply rather generally to mineral resources, but they are\r\nparticularly pertinent in relation to the common rock materials which\r\nthe geologist is daily handling,--for he is likely to assume that he\r\nknows all about them and that he is qualified to give professional\r\nadvice to industries using them. In connection with metallic resources,\r\nthe metallurgical and other technical requirements are likely to be more\r\ndefinitely recognized and the lines more sharply drawn, with the result\r\nthat the geologist is perhaps not so likely to venture into problems\r\nwhich he is not qualified to handle.\r\n\r\nThe limits to geologic work here discussed are not necessarily limits\r\nseparating scientific from non-scientific work. The study and\r\ndetermination of the qualities of rocks necessary for commercial\r\npurposes is fully as scientific as a study of the qualities commonly\r\nconsidered in purely geologic work, and the results of technical\r\ncommercial investigations may be highly illuminating from a purely\r\ngeological standpoint. When a field of scientific endeavor has been\r\nestablished by custom, any excursion beyond traditional limits is almost\r\nsure to be regarded by conservatives in the field as non-scientific, and\r\nto be lightly regarded. The writer is fully conscious of the existence\r\nof limits and the necessity for their recognition; but he would explain\r\nhis caution in exceeding these limits on the ground of training and\r\neffectiveness, rather than on fear that he is becoming tainted with\r\nnon-scientific matters the moment he steps beyond the boundaries of his\r\ntraditional field.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOILS AS A MINERAL RESOURCE\r\n\r\nSoils are not ordinarily listed as mineral resources; but as weathered\r\nand altered rock of great economic value, they belong nearly at the head\r\nof the list of mineral products.\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGIN OF SOILS\r\n\r\nSoil originate from rocks, igneous, sedimentary, and \"metamorphic\" by\r\nprocesses of weathering, and by the mixing of the altered mineral\r\nproducts with decayed plant remains or _humus_. The humus averages\r\nperhaps 3 or 4 per cent of the soil mass and sometimes constitutes as\r\nmuch as 75 per cent. Not all weathered rock is soil in the agricultural\r\nsense. For this purpose the term is mainly restricted to the upper few\r\ninches or feet penetrated by plant roots.\r\n\r\nThe general process of soil formation constitutes one of the most\r\nimportant phases of katamorphism--the destructive side of the\r\nmetamorphic cycle, described in Chapter II. Processes of katamorphism or\r\nweathering, usually accompanied by the formation of soils, affect the\r\nsurface rocks over practically all the continental areas.\r\n\r\nThe weathering of a highly acid igneous rock with much quartz produces a\r\nresidual soil with much quartz. The weathering of a basic igneous rock\r\nwithout quartz produces a clay soil without quartz, which may be high\r\nin iron. Where disintegration has been important the soil contains an\r\nabundance of the original silicates of the rock, and less of the altered\r\nminerals.\r\n\r\nThe production of soil from sedimentary rocks involves the same\r\nprocesses as alter igneous rocks; but, starting from rocks of different\r\ncomposition, the result is of course different in some respects.\r\nSandstones by weathering yield only a sandy soil. Limestones lose their\r\ncalcium carbonate by solution, leaving only clay with fragments of\r\nquartz or chert as impurities. A foot of soil may represent the\r\nweathering of a hundred feet of limestone. Shales may weather into\r\nproducts more nearly like those of the weathering of igneous rocks.\r\nSilicates in the shales are broken down to form clay, which is mixed\r\nwith the iron oxide and quartz.\r\n\r\nIn some localities the soil may accumulate to a considerable depth,\r\nallowing the processes of weathering to go to an extreme; in others the\r\nprocesses may be interrupted by erosion, which sweeps off the weathered\r\nproducts at intermediate stages of decomposition and may leave a very\r\nthin and little decomposed soil.\r\n\r\nSoils formed by weathering may remain in place as residual soils, or\r\nthey may be transported, sorted, and redeposited, either on land or\r\nunder water. It is estimated by the United States Bureau of Soils[14]\r\nthat upward of 90 per cent of the soils of the United States which have\r\nbeen thus far mapped owe their occurrence and distribution to\r\ntransportation by moving water, air, and ice (glaciers), and that less\r\nthan 10 per cent have remained in place above their parent rock.\r\nGlaciers may move the weathered rock products, or they may grind the\r\nfresh rocks into a powder called _rock flour_, and thus form soils\r\nhaving more nearly the chemical composition of the unaltered rocks.\r\nGlacial soils are ordinarily rather poorly sorted, while wind and\r\nwater-borne soils are more likely to show a high degree of sorting.\r\n\r\nThe character of a transported soil is less closely related to the\r\nparent rock than is that of a residual soil, because the processes of\r\nsorting and mixture of materials from different sources intervene to\r\ndevelop deposits of a nature quite different from residual soils; but\r\neven transported soil may sometimes be traced to a known rock\r\nparentage.\r\n\r\nWhere deposited under water, soil materials may be brought above the\r\nwater by physiographic changes, and exposed at the surface in condition\r\nfor immediate use. Or, they may become buried by other sediments and not\r\nbe exposed again until after they have been pretty well hardened and\r\ncemented,--in which case they must again undergo the softening processes\r\nof weathering before they become available for use. Where soils become\r\nburied under other rocks and become hardened, they are classed as\r\nsedimentary rocks and form a part of the geologic record. Many residual\r\nand transported soils are to be recognized in the geologic column; in\r\nfact a large number of the sedimentary rocks ordinarily dealt with in\r\nstratigraphic geology are really transported soils.\r\n\r\nThe development of soils by weathering should not be regarded as a\r\nspecial process of rock alteration, unrelated to processes producing\r\nother mineral products. Exactly the same processes that produce soils\r\nmay yield important deposits of iron ore, bauxite, and clay, and they\r\ncause also secondary enrichment of many metallic mineral deposits. For\r\ninstance the weathering of a syenite rock containing no quartz, under\r\ncertain conditions, as in Arkansas, results in great bauxite deposits\r\nwhich are truly soils and are useful as such,--but which happen to be\r\nmore valuable because of their content of bauxite. The weathering of a\r\nbasic igneous rock, as in Cuba, may produce important residual iron ore\r\ndeposits, which are also used as soils. Weathering of ferruginous\r\nlimestone may produce residual iron and manganese ores in clay soils.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPOSITION OF SOILS AND PLANT GROWTH\r\n\r\nThe mineral ingredients in soils which are essential for plant growth\r\ninclude water, potash, lime, magnesia, nitrates, sulphur, and phosphoric\r\nacid--all of which are subordinate in amount to the common products of\r\nweathering (pp. 20-22, 23-24). Of these constituents magnesia is almost\r\ninvariably present in sufficient quantity; while potash, nitrates, lime,\r\nsulphur, and phosphoric acid, although often sufficiently abundant in\r\nvirgin soil, when extracted from the soils by plant growth are liable to\r\nexhaustion under ordinary methods of cultivation, and may need to be\r\nreplenished by fertilizers (Chapter VII). Some soils may be so\r\nexcessively high in silica, iron, or other constituents, that the\r\nremaining constituents are in too small amounts for successful plant\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\nEven where soils originally have enough of all the necessary chemical\r\nelements, one soil may support plant growth and another may not, for the\r\nreason that the necessary constituents are soluble and hence available\r\nto the plant roots in one case and are not soluble in the other. Plainly\r\nthe mineral combinations in which the various elements occur are\r\nimportant factors in making them available for plant use. Similarly a\r\nsoil of a certain chemical and mineralogical composition may be fruitful\r\nunder one set of climatic conditions and a soil of like composition may\r\nbe barren at another locality--indicating that availability of\r\nconstituents is also determined by climatic and other conditions of\r\nweathering. Even with the same chemical composition and the same\r\nclimatic conditions, there may be such differences in texture between\r\nvarious soils as to make them widely different in yield.\r\n\r\nThe unit of soil classification is the _soil type_, which is a soil\r\nhaving agricultural unity, as determined by texture, chemical character,\r\ntopography, and climate. The types commonly named are clay, clay loam,\r\nsilt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, fine sand, and sand. In\r\ngeneral the soil materials are so heterogeneous and so remote from\r\nspecific rock origin, that in such classification the geologic factor of\r\norigin is not taken into account. More broadly, soils may be classified\r\ninto provinces on the basis of geography, similar physiographic\r\nconditions, and similarity of parent rocks; for instance, the soils of\r\nthe Piedmont plateau province, of the arid southwest region, of the\r\nglacial and loessal province, etc. In such classification the geologic\r\nfactors are more important. Soils within a province may be subdivided\r\ninto \"soil series\" on the basis of common types of sub-soils, relief,\r\ndrainage, and origin.\r\n\r\n\r\nUSE OF GEOLOGY IN SOIL STUDY\r\n\r\nWhile the desirability of particular soils is related in a broad way to\r\nthe character of the parent rocks, and while by geologic knowledge\r\ncertain territories can be predicated in advance as being more favorable\r\nthan others to the development of good soils, so many other factors\r\nenter into the question that the geologic factor may be a subordinate\r\none. A soil expert finds a knowledge of geology useful as a basis for a\r\nbroad study of his subject; but in following up its intricacies he gives\r\nattention mainly to other factors, such as the availability of common\r\nconstituents for plant use, the existence and availability of minute\r\nquantities of materials not ordinarily regarded as important by the\r\ngeologist, the climatic conditions, and the texture. As the geologic\r\nfactors are many of them comparatively simple, much of the expert work\r\non soils requires only elementary and empirical knowledge of geology.\r\nThe geologist, although he may understand fully the origin of soils and\r\nmay indicate certain broad features, must acquire a vast technique not\r\nclosely related to geology before he becomes effective in soil survey\r\nwork and diagnosis.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons the mapping and classification of soils, while often\r\nstarted by geologists of state or federal surveys, have in their\r\ntechnical development and application now passed largely into the hands\r\nof soil experts in the special soil surveys affiliated with the U. S.\r\nDepartment of Agriculture and with agricultural colleges.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[13] A good summary of this subject may be found in _Engineering\r\nGeology_, by H. Ries and T. L. Watson, Wiley and Sons, 2d ed., 1915.\r\n\r\n[14] Marbut, Curtis F., Soils of the United States: _Bull. 96, Bureau of\r\nSoils_, 1913, p. 10.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE FERTILIZER GROUP OF MINERALS\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL COMMENTS\r\n\r\nSoils are weathered rock more or less mixed with organic material. The\r\nweathering processes forming soils are in the field of geologic\r\ninvestigation, but the study of soils in relation to agriculture\r\nrequires attention to texture and to several of their very minor\r\nconstituents which have little geologic significance. Soil study has\r\ntherefore become a highly specialized and technicalized subject,--for\r\nwhich a geological background is essential, but which is usually beyond\r\nthe range of the geologist. To supply substances which are deficient in\r\nsoils, however, requires the mining, quarrying, or extraction of\r\nimportant mineral resources, and in this part of the soil problem the\r\ngeologist is especially interested.\r\n\r\nSoils may be originally deficient in nitrates, phosphates, or potash; or\r\nthe continued cropping of soils may take out these materials faster than\r\nthe natural processes of nature supply them. In some soils there are\r\nsufficient phosphates and potash to supply all plant needs indefinitely;\r\nbut the weathering and alteration processes, through which these\r\nmaterials are rendered soluble and available for plant life, in most\r\ncases are unable to keep up with the depletion caused by cropping. A ton\r\nof wheat takes out of the soil on an average 47 pounds of nitrogen, 18\r\npounds of phosphoric acid, 12 pounds of potash. On older soils in Europe\r\nit has been found necessary to use on an average 200 pounds of mixed\r\nmineral fertilizers annually per acre. On the newer soils of the United\r\nStates the average thus far used has been less than one-seventh of this\r\namount. The United States has thus far been using up the original\r\nmaterials stored in the soil by nature, but these have not been\r\nsufficient to yield anything like the crop output per acre of the more\r\nhighly fertilized soils of Europe.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the nitrates, phosphates, and potassium salts, important\r\namounts of lime and sulphuric acid, and some gypsum, are used in\r\nconnection with soils. Lime is derived from crushed limestone (pp.\r\n82-83), and is used primarily to counteract acidity or sourness of the\r\nsoil; it is, therefore, only indirectly related to fertilizers.\r\nSulphuric acid is used to treat rock phosphates to make them more\r\nsoluble and available to plant life. It requires the mining of pyrite\r\nand sulphur. Gypsum, under the name of \"land-plaster,\" is applied to\r\nsoils which are deficient in the sulphur required for plant life;\r\nincrease in its use in the future seems probable. There are also\r\nconsiderable amounts of inert mineral substances which are used as\r\nfillers in fertilizers to give bulk to the product, but which have no\r\nagricultural value. The proportions of the fertilizer substances used in\r\nthe United States are roughly summarized in Figure 4.\r\n\r\nThe United States possesses abundant supplies of two of the chief\r\nmineral substances entering into commercial fertilizers,--phosphate rock\r\nand the sulphur-bearing materials necessary to treat it. For potash the\r\nUnited States is dependent on Europe, unless the domestic industry is\r\nvery greatly fostered under protective tariff. For the mineral nitrates\r\nthe United States has been dependent on Chile, and because of the\r\ncheapness of the supply will doubtless continue to draw heavily from\r\nthis source. However, because of the domestic development of plants for\r\nthe fixation of nitrogen from the air, the recovery of nitrogen from\r\ncoal in the by-product processes, and the use of nitrogenous plants, the\r\nUnited States is likely to require progressively less of the mineral\r\nnitrates from Chile.\r\n\r\nThe fertilizer industry of the United States is yet in its infancy and\r\nis likely to have a large growth. Furthermore much remains to be learned\r\nabout the mixing of fertilizers and the amounts and kinds of materials\r\nto be used. The importance of sulphur as a plant food has been realized\r\ncomparatively recently. The use of fertilizers in the United States has\r\ncome partly through education and the activity of agricultural schools\r\nand partly through advertising by fertilizer companies. The increased\r\nuse of potash has been due largely to the propaganda of the German sales\r\nagents. An examination of a map showing distribution of the use of\r\nfertilizers over the country indicates very clearly the erratic\r\ndistribution of the effects of these various activities. One locality\r\nmay use large amounts, while adjacent territory of similar physical\r\nconditions uses little. The sudden withdrawal of fertilizers for a\r\nperiod of three or four years during the war had very deleterious\r\neffects in some localities, but was not so disastrous as expected in\r\nothers,--emphasizing the fact that the use of fertilizers has been\r\npartly fortuitous and not nicely adjusted to specific needs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4. FERTILIZER SITUATION IN THE UNITED\r\nSTATES. SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION--UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM]\r\n\r\n\r\nNITRATES\r\n\r\n\r\nECONOMIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nThere are several sources of nitrogen for fertilizer purposes: mineral\r\nnitrates, nitrogen taken from the air by certain plants with the aid of\r\nbacteria and plowed into the soil, nitrogen taken directly from the air\r\nby combining nitrogen and oxygen atoms in an electric arc, or by\r\ncombining nitrogen and hydrogen to form ammonia, nitrogen taken from the\r\nair to make a compound of calcium, carbon, and nitrogen (cyanamid),\r\nnitrogen saved from coal in the form of ammonia as a by-product of\r\ncoke-manufacture, and nitrogen from various organic wastes. Nitrogen in\r\nthe form of ammonia is also one of the potential products of oil-shales\r\n(p. 150). While the principal use of nitrogenous materials is as\r\nfertilizers, additional important quantities are used in ammonia for\r\nrefrigerating plants, and in the form of nitric acid in a large number\r\nof chemical industries. During the war the use of nitrates was largely\r\ndiverted to explosives manufacture. The geologist is interested\r\nprincipally in the mineral nitrates as a mineral resource, but the other\r\nsources of nitrogen, particularly its recovery from coal, also touch his\r\nfield.\r\n\r\nAlmost the single source of mineral nitrates for the world at present is\r\nChile, where there are deposits of sodium nitrate or Chile saltpeter,\r\ncontaining minor amounts of potassium nitrate. About two-thirds of the\r\nChilean material normally goes to Europe and about one-fourth to the\r\nUnited States. The supply has been commercially controlled chiefly by\r\nGreat Britain and by Chilean companies backed by British and German\r\ncapital.\r\n\r\nThe dependence of the world on Chile became painfully apparent during\r\nthe war. Germany was the only nation which had developed other sources\r\nof nitrogenous material to any great extent. The other nations were\r\ndependent in a very large degree on the mineral nitrates, both for\r\nfertilizer and munition purposes. Total demands far exceeded the total\r\noutput from Chile, requiring international agreement as to the division\r\nof the output among the nations. The stream of several hundred ships\r\ncarrying nitrates from Chile was one of the vital war arteries. This\r\nsituation led to strenuous efforts in the belligerent countries toward\r\nthe development of other sources of nitrogen. The United States, under\r\ngovernmental appropriation, began the building of extensive plants for\r\nthe fixation of nitrogen from the air, and the building of by-product\r\ncoke ovens in the place of the old wasteful beehive ovens was\r\naccelerated. Germany before the war had already gone far in both of\r\nthese directions, not only within her own boundaries, but in the\r\nbuilding of fixation plants in Scandinavia and Switzerland. War\r\nconditions required further development of these processes in Germany,\r\nwith the result that this country was soon entirely self-supporting in\r\nthis regard. One of the effects was the almost complete elimination in\r\nGermany of anything but the by-product process of coking coal.\r\n\r\nWar-time development of the nitrogen industry in the United States for\r\nmunition purposes brought the domestic production almost up to the\r\npre-war requirements for fertilizers alone. With the increasing demand\r\nfor fertilizers and with the cheapness of the Chilean supply of natural\r\nnitrates, it is likely that the United States will continue for a good\r\nmany years to import considerable amounts of Chilean nitrates. It may be\r\nnoted that, although this country normally consumes about one-fourth of\r\nthe Chilean product, American interests commercially control less than\r\none-twentieth of the output. Presumably, if for no other purpose than\r\nfuture protection, effort will be made to develop the domestic industry\r\nto a point where in a crisis the United States could be independent of\r\nChile. Particularly may an increase in the output of by-product ammonia\r\nfrom coke manufacture be looked for (see also pp. 118-119), since\r\nnitrogenous material thus produced need bear no fixed part of the cost\r\nof production, and requires no protective tariff.\r\n\r\nThe reserves of Chilean nitrate are known to be sufficient for world\r\nrequirements for an indefinitely long future.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nMineral nitrates in general, and particularly those of soda and potash,\r\nare readily soluble at ordinary temperatures. Mineral nitrate deposits\r\nare therefore very rare, and are found only in arid regions or other\r\nplaces where they are protected from rain and ground-water. The only\r\nlarge deposits known are those of northern Chile and some extensions in\r\nadjacent parts of Peru and Bolivia. These are located on high desert\r\nplateaus, where there is almost a total absence of rain, and form\r\nblankets of one to six feet in thickness near the surface. The most\r\nimportant mineral, the sodium nitrate or Chile saltpeter, is mingled\r\nwith various other soluble salts, including common salt, borax minerals,\r\nand potassium nitrate, and with loose clay, sand, and gravel. The\r\nnitrate deposits occur largely around and just above slight basin-like\r\ndepressions in the desert which contain an abundance of common salt. The\r\nhighest grade material contains 40 to 50 per cent of sodium nitrate, and\r\nmaterial to be of shipping grade must run at least 12 to 15 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the nitrate beds is commonly believed to be similar to\r\nthat of beds of rock salt (pp. 295-298), borax, and other saline\r\nresidues. The source of the nitrogen was probably organic matter in the\r\nsoil, such as former deposits of bird guano, bones (which are actually\r\nfound in the same desert basin), and ancient vegetable matter. By the\r\naction of nitrifying bacteria on this organic matter, nitrate salts are\r\nbelieved to have formed which were leached out by surface and ground\r\nwaters, and probably carried in solution to enclosed bodies of water.\r\nHere they became mingled with various other salts, and all were\r\nprecipitated out as the waters of the basins evaporated. Deliquescence\r\nand later migration of the more soluble nitrates resulted in their\r\naccumulation around the edges of the basins. The nitrate beds are thus\r\nessentially a product of desiccation.\r\n\r\nWhile the origin just set forth is rather generally accepted, several\r\nother theories have been advanced. It has been suggested that the\r\ndeposits were not formed in water basins, but that ground water carrying\r\nnitrates in solution has been and is rising to the surface,--where,\r\nunder the extremely arid conditions, it evaporates rapidly, leaving the\r\nnitrates mixed with the surface clays. One group of writers accounts for\r\nthe deposits by the fixation of atmospheric nitrogen through electrical\r\nphenomena. Still others note the frequent presence of nitrogen in\r\nvolcanic exhalations and the association of the Chilean nitrate beds\r\nwith surface volcanic rocks; they suggest that these rocks were the\r\nsource of the nitrogen, which under unusual climatic conditions was\r\nleached out and then deposited by evaporation.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHOSPHATES\r\n\r\n\r\nECONOMIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nThe principal use of natural phosphates is in the manufacture of\r\nfertilizers. They are also used in the manufacture of phosphorus,\r\nphosphoric acid, and other phosphorus compounds, for matches, for\r\ncertain metallurgical operations, and for gases used in military\r\noperations.\r\n\r\nThe material mined is mainly a phosphate of lime (tricalcium phosphate).\r\nTo make it available for plant use, it is treated with sulphuric acid to\r\nform a soluble superphosphate; hence the importance of sulphuric acid,\r\nand its mineral sources pyrite and sulphur, in the fertilizer industry.\r\nA small percentage of the phosphate is also ground up and applied\r\ndirectly to the soil in the raw form. Other phosphatic materials are the\r\nbasic slag from phosphatic iron ores made into Thomas-process steel,\r\nguano from the Pacific islands, and bone and refuse (tankage) from the\r\ncattle raising and packing countries. These materials are used for the\r\nsame purposes as the natural phosphates.\r\n\r\nThe United States is the largest factor in the world's phosphate\r\nindustry, with reference both to production and reserves.\r\n\r\nThe largest and most available of the European sources are in Tunis and\r\nAlgeria, under French control, and in Egypt, under English control.\r\nBelgium and northern France have been considerable producers of\r\nphosphates, but, with the development of higher grade deposits in other\r\ncountries, their production has fallen to a very small fraction of the\r\nworld's total. There also has been very small and insignificant\r\nproduction in Spain and Great Britain. Russia has large reserves which\r\nare practically unmined.\r\n\r\nWhile there is comparatively little phosphate rock in western Europe, a\r\nconsiderable amount of the phosphate supply is obtained as a by-product\r\nfrom Thomas slag, derived from phosphatic iron ores. These ores are\r\nchiefly from Lorraine and Sweden, but English and Russian ores can be\r\nsimilarly used.\r\n\r\nOutside of Europe and the United States, there are smaller phosphate\r\nsupplies in Canada, the Dutch West Indies, Venezuela, Chile, South\r\nAustralia, New Zealand, and several islands of the Indian and South\r\nPacific Oceans. None of these has yet contributed largely to world\r\nproduction, and their distance from the principal consuming countries\r\nbordering the North Atlantic basin is so great that there is not likely\r\nto be any great movement to this part of the world. On the other hand,\r\nsome of the South Sea islands have large reserves of exceptionally high\r\ngrade guano and bone phosphates, which will doubtless be used in\r\nincreasing amounts for export to Japan, New Zealand, and other nearby\r\ncountries. The most important of these islands are now controlled by\r\nGreat Britain, Japan, and France.\r\n\r\nA striking feature of the situation is that the central European\r\ncountries, which have been large consumers of phosphate material, have\r\nlost not only the Pacific island phosphates but the Lorraine phosphatic\r\niron ores, and are now almost completely dependent on British, French,\r\nand United States phosphate.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, reserves of phosphate are very large. They are\r\nmined principally in Florida, Tennessee, and South Carolina; but great\r\nreserves, though of lower grade, are known in Arkansas, Montana, Idaho,\r\nWyoming, and Utah. There are possibilities for the development of local\r\nphosphate industries in the west, in connection with the manufacture of\r\nsulphuric acid from waste smelting gases at nearby mining centers. The\r\nAnaconda Copper Mining Company has taken up the manufacture of\r\nsuperphosphate as a means of using sulphuric acid made in relation to\r\nits smelting operations. The United States is independent in phosphate\r\nsupplies and has a surplus for export. This country, England, and France\r\nexercise control of the greater part of the world's supply of phosphatic\r\nmaterial. In competition for world trade, the Florida and Carolina\r\nphosphates are favorably situated for export, but there is strong\r\ncompetition in Europe from the immense fields in French North Africa,\r\nwhich are about equally well situated.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nSmall amounts of phosphorus are common in igneous rocks, in the form of\r\nthe mineral apatite (calcium phosphate with calcium chloride or\r\nfluoride). Apatite is especially abundant in some pegmatites. In a few\r\nplaces, as in the Adirondacks where magnetic concentration of iron ores\r\nleaves a residue containing much apatite, and in Canada and Spain where\r\nveins of apatite have been mined, this material is used as a source of\r\nphosphate fertilizer. The great bulk of the world's phosphate, however,\r\nis obtained from other sources--sedimentary and residual beds described\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\nPhosphorus in the rocks is dissolved in one form or another by the\r\nground-waters; a part of it is taken up by land plants and animals for\r\nthe building of their tissues, and another part goes in solution to the\r\nsea to be taken up by sea plants and animals. In places where the bones\r\nand excrements of land animals or the shells and droppings of sea\r\nanimals accumulate, deposits of phosphatic material may be built up.\r\n\r\nIn certain places where great numbers of sea birds congregate, as on\r\ndesert coasts and oceanic islands, guano deposits have been formed. Some\r\nof them, like the worked-out deposits of Peru and Chile, are in arid\r\nclimates and have been well preserved. Others, like those of the West\r\nIndies and Oceania, are subjected to the action of occasional rains; and\r\nto a large extent the phosphates have been leached out, carried down,\r\nand reprecipitated, permeating and partially replacing the underlying\r\nlimestones. In this way deposits have been formed containing as high as\r\n85 per cent calcium phosphate.\r\n\r\nEven more important bodies of phosphates have been produced by the\r\naccumulation of marine animal remains, probably with the aid of joint\r\nchemical, bacterial, and mechanical precipitation. These processes have\r\nformed the chief productive deposits of the world, including those of\r\nthe United States, northern Africa, and Russia, and also the phosphatic\r\niron ores of England and central Europe. The sedimentary features of\r\nmany phosphate rocks, particularly their oolitic textures, show a marked\r\nsimilarity to the features of the Clinton type of iron ores (pp.\r\n166-167).\r\n\r\nThe marine phosphate beds originally consist principally of calcium\r\nphosphate and calcium carbonate in varying proportions. Depending on the\r\namount of secondary enrichment, they form two main types of deposits.\r\nThe extensive beds of the western United States (in the upper\r\nCarboniferous) are hard, and very little enrichment by weathering has\r\ntaken place; they carry in their richer portions 70 to 80 per cent\r\ncalcium phosphate, and large sections range only from about 30 to 50 per\r\ncent. In the southeastern deposits (Silurian and Devonian in Tennessee\r\nand Tertiary in the Carolinas and Florida), there has been considerable\r\nenrichment, the rock is softer, and the general grade ranges from 65 to\r\n80 per cent. Both calcium carbonate and calcium phosphate are soluble in\r\nordinary ground waters, but the carbonate is the more soluble of the\r\ntwo. Thus the carbonate has been dissolved out more rapidly, and in\r\naddition descending waters carrying the phosphate have frequently\r\ndeposited it to pick up the carbonate. These enriching processes,\r\nsometimes aided by mechanical concentration, have formed high-grade\r\ndeposits both in the originally phosphatic beds and in various\r\nunderlying strata. Concretionary and nodular textures are common. The\r\n\"pebble\" deposits of Florida consist of the phosphatic materials broken\r\nup and worked over by river waters and advancing shallow seas.\r\n\r\n\r\nPYRITE\r\n\r\n\r\nECONOMIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nThe principal use of pyrite is in the manufacture of sulphuric acid.\r\nLarge quantities of acid are used in the manufacture of fertilizers from\r\nphosphate rock, and during war times in the manufacture of munitions.\r\nSulphuric acid converts the phosphate rock into superphosphate, which is\r\nsoluble and available for plant use. Other uses of the acid are referred\r\nto in connection with sulphur. Pyrite is also used in Europe for the\r\nmanufacture of paper from wood-pulp, but in the United States native\r\nsulphur has thus far been exclusively used for this purpose. The residue\r\nfrom the roasting of pyrite is a high-grade iron ore material frequently\r\nvery low in phosphorus, which is desirable in making up mixtures for\r\niron blast furnaces.\r\n\r\nMost of the countries of Europe are producers of pyrite, and important\r\namounts are also produced in the United States and Canada. The European\r\nproduction is marketed mainly on that continent, but considerable\r\namounts come to the United States from Spain.\r\n\r\nBefore the war domestic sources supplied a fourth to a third of the\r\ndomestic demand for pyrite. Imports came mainly from Spain and Portugal\r\nto consuming centers on the Atlantic seaboard. The curtailment of\r\noverseas imports of pyrite during the war increased domestic production\r\nby about a third and resulted also in drawing more heavily on Canadian\r\nsupplies, but the total was not sufficient to meet the demand. The\r\ndemand was met by the increased use of sulphur from domestic deposits\r\n(p. 109). At the close of the war supplies of pyrite had been\r\naccumulated to such an extent that, with the prospect of reopening of\r\nSpanish importation, pyrite production in the United States practically\r\nceased. War experience has demonstrated the possibility of substitution\r\nof sulphur, which the United States has in large and cheaply mined\r\nquantities. The future of the pyrite industry in the United States\r\ntherefore looks cloudy, except for supplies used locally, as in the\r\nterritory tributary to the Great Lakes, and except for small amounts\r\nlocally recovered as by-products in the mining of coal or from ores of\r\nzinc, lead, and copper. Pyrite production in the past has been chiefly\r\nin the Appalachian region, particularly in Virginia and New York, and in\r\nCalifornia.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nPyrite, the yellow iron sulphide, is the commonest and most abundant of\r\nthe metallic sulphides. It is formed under a large variety of conditions\r\nand associations. Marcasite and pyrrhotite, other iron sulphide\r\nminerals, are frequently found with pyrite and are used for the same\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nThe great deposits of Rio Tinto, Spain, which produce about half of the\r\nworld's pyrite, were formed by replacement of slates by heated solutions\r\nfrom nearby igneous rocks. The ores are in lenticular bodies, and\r\nconsist of almost massive pyrite with a small amount of quartz and\r\nscattered grains and threads of chalcopyrite (copper-iron sulphide).\r\nThey carry about 50 per cent of sulphur, and the larger part carries\r\nabout 2 per cent of copper which is also recovered.\r\n\r\nSimilar occurrences of pyrite on a smaller scale are known in many\r\nplaces. Pyrite is very commonly found in vein and replacement deposits\r\nof gold, silver, copper, lead, and zinc. In the Mississippi valley it is\r\nextracted as a by-product from the lead and zinc ores, and in the\r\nCordilleran region large quantities of by-product pyrite could easily be\r\nproduced if there were a local demand. The pyrite deposits of the\r\nAppalachian region are chiefly lenses in schists; they are of uncertain\r\norigin though some are believed to have been formed by replacement of\r\nmetamorphosed limestones and schists.\r\n\r\nUnder weathering conditions pyrite oxidizes, the sulphur forming\r\nsulphuric acid,--an important agent in the secondary enrichment of\r\ncopper and other sulphides,--and the iron forming the minerals hematite\r\nand limonite in the shape of a \"gossan\" or \"iron-cap.\"\r\n\r\nPyrite is likewise frequently found in sediments, apparently being\r\nformed mainly by the reducing action of organic matter on iron salts in\r\nsolution. In Illinois and adjacent states it is obtained as a by-product\r\nof coal mining.\r\n\r\n\r\nSULPHUR\r\n\r\n\r\nECONOMIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nSulphur is used for many of the same purposes as pyrite. Under pre-war\r\nconditions, the largest use in the United States was in the manufacture\r\nof paper pulp by the sulphite process. Minor uses were in agriculture as\r\na fungicide and insecticide, in vulcanizing rubber, and in the\r\nmanufacture of gunpowder. About 5 per cent of the sulphur of the United\r\nStates was used in the manufacture of sulphuric acid. During the war\r\nthis use was greatly increased because of the shortage of pyrite and the\r\nlarge quantities of sulphuric acid necessary for the manufacture of\r\nexplosives. The replacement of pyrite by sulphur in the manufacture of\r\nsulphuric acid has continued since the war, and in the future is likely\r\nto continue to play an important part. Sulphuric acid is an essential\r\nmaterial for a great range of manufacturing processes. Some of its more\r\nimportant applications are: in the manufacture of superphosphate\r\nfertilizer from phosphate rock; in the refining of petroleum products;\r\nin the iron, steel, and coke industries; in the manufacture of\r\nnitroglycerin and other explosives; and in general metallurgical and\r\nchemical practice.\r\n\r\nThe United States is the world's largest sulphur producer. The principal\r\nforeign countries producing important amounts of sulphur are Italy,\r\nJapan, Spain, and Chile. Europe is the chief market for the Italian\r\nsulphur. In spite of increased demands in Europe the Italian production\r\nhas decreased as the result of unfavorable labor, mining, and\r\ntransportation conditions, and the deficit has had to be met from the\r\nUnited States. Japan's sulphur production has been increasing. Normally\r\nabout half of the material exported comes to the United States to supply\r\nthe needs of the paper industry in the Pacific states, and half goes to\r\nAustralia and other British colonies. Spain's production is relatively\r\nsmall and has been increasing slowly; most of it is consumed locally.\r\nChile's small production is mainly consumed at home and large additional\r\namounts are imported.\r\n\r\nThe sulphur output of the United States, which in 1913-14 was second to\r\nItaly, now amounts to three-fourths of the entire output of the world,\r\nand the United States has become a large exporter of sulphur. Supplies\r\nare ample and production increasing, with the result that the United\r\nStates can not only meet its own demands, but can use this commodity\r\nextensively in world trade. Small amounts of sulphur are mined in some\r\nof the western states, but over 98 per cent of the production comes from\r\nLouisiana and Texas.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nNative sulphur is found principally in sedimentary beds, where it is\r\nassociated with gypsum and usually with organic matter. Deposits of this\r\ntype are known in many places, the most important being those of Sicily\r\nand of the Gulf Coast in the United States. In the latter region beds of\r\nlimestone carry lenses of sulphur and gypsum which are apparently\r\nlocalized in dome-like upbowings of the strata. The deposits are\r\noverlain by several hundred feet of loose, water-bearing sands, through\r\nwhich it is difficult to sink a shaft. An ingenious and efficient\r\nprocess of mining is used whereby superheated water is pumped down to\r\nmelt the sulphur, which is then forced to the surface by compressed air\r\nand allowed to consolidate in large bins. The Sicilian deposits are\r\nsimilar lenses in clayey limestones containing 20 to 25 per cent of\r\nsulphur, associated with gypsum and bituminous marl; they are mined by\r\nshafts.\r\n\r\nConcerning the origin of these deposits several theories have been\r\nadvanced. It has been thought that the materials for the deposits were\r\nprecipitated at the same time as the enclosing sediments; and that the\r\nsulphur may have been formed by the oxidation of hydrogen sulphide in\r\nthe precipitating waters through the agency of air or of\r\nsulphur-secreting bacteria, or that it may have been produced by the\r\nreduction of gypsum by organic matter or bacteria. Others have suggested\r\nthat hot waters rising from igneous rocks may have brought in both the\r\nsulphur and the gypsum, which in crystallizing caused the upbowing of\r\nthe strata which is seen in the Gulf fields (see also p. 298).\r\n\r\nNative sulphur is also found in mineral springs from which hydrogen\r\nsulphide issues, where it is produced by the oxidation of the hydrogen\r\nsulphide. It likewise occurs in fissures of lava and around volcanic\r\nvents, where it has probably been formed by reactions between the\r\nvolcanic gases and the air. The Japanese and Chilean deposits are of the\r\nvolcanic type.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOTASH\r\n\r\n\r\nECONOMIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nPotash is used principally as a component of fertilizers in agriculture.\r\nIt is also used in the manufacture of soap, certain kinds of glass,\r\nmatches, certain explosives, and chemical reagents.\r\n\r\nFor a long time potash production was essentially a German monopoly. The\r\nprincipal deposits are in the vicinity of Stassfurt in north central\r\nGermany (about the Harz Mountains). Stassfurt salts are undoubtedly\r\nample to supply the world's needs of potash for an indefinite future.\r\nHowever, other deposits, discovered in the Rhine Valley in Alsace in\r\n1904, have been proved to be of great extent; and though the production\r\nhas hitherto been limited by restrictions imposed by the German\r\nGovernment, it has nevertheless become considerable.[15] The grade (18\r\nper cent K_{2}O) is superior to the general run of material taken from\r\nthe main German deposits, and the deposits have a regularity of\r\nstructure and uniformity of material favorable to cheaper mining and\r\nrefining than obtains in the Stassfurt deposits.\r\n\r\nOther countries have also developed supplies of potash, some of which\r\nwill probably continue to produce even in competition with the deposits\r\nof recognized importance referred to above. Noteworthy among the newer\r\ndevelopments are those in Spain.[16] These have not yet produced on any\r\nlarge scale, but their future production may be considerable. Less\r\nimportant deposits are known in Galicia, Tunis, Russia, and eastern\r\nAbyssinia, and the nitrate deposits of Chile contain a small percentage\r\nof potash which is being recovered in some of the operations.\r\n\r\nPrior to the war the United States obtained its potash from Germany. The\r\nGerman potash industry was well organized and protected by the German\r\nGovernment, which made every effort to maintain a world monopoly. During\r\nthe war the potash exports from Germany were cut off, excepting exports\r\nto the neutrals immediately adjoining German territory. The result in\r\nthe United States was that the price of potash rose so far as to greatly\r\ndiminish its use as fertilizer.\r\n\r\nThe consequent efforts to increase potash production in the United\r\nStates met with considerable success, but the maximum production\r\nattained was only about one-fourth of the ordinary pre-war requirements.\r\nThe principal American sources are alkaline beds and brines in Nebraska,\r\nUtah, and California, and especially at Searles Lake, California. These\r\nfurnished 75 per cent of the total output. Minor amounts have been\r\nextracted in Utah from the mineral alunite (a sulphate of potassium and\r\naluminum), in Wyoming from leucite (a potassium-aluminum silicate), in\r\nCalifornia from kelp or seaweed, and in various localities from\r\ncement-mill and blast-furnace dusts, from wood ashes, from wool\r\nwashings, from the waste residues of distilleries and beet-sugar\r\nrefineries, and from miscellaneous industrial wastes. At the close of\r\nthe war, sufficient progress had been made in the potash industry to\r\nindicate that the United States might become self-supporting in the\r\nfuture, though at high cost. The renewal of importation of cheap potash\r\nfrom Germany, with probable further offerings from Alsace and Spain,\r\nmakes it impossible for the United States potash production to continue;\r\nexcept, perhaps, for the recovery of by-products which will go on in\r\nconnection with other industries. Demand for a protective tariff has\r\nbeen the inevitable result (see Chapters XVII and XVIII).\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nPotassium is one of the eight most abundant elements in the earth. It\r\noccurs as a primary constituent of most igneous rocks, some of which\r\ncarry percentages as high as those in commercial potash salts used for\r\nfertilizers. It is present in some sediments and likewise occurs in many\r\nschists and gneisses. Various potassium silicates--leucite, feldspar,\r\nsericite, and glauconite--and the potassium sulphate, alunite, have\r\nreceived attention and certain of them have been utilized to a small\r\nextent, but none of them are normally able to compete on the market.\r\nPotential supplies are thus practically unlimited in amount and\r\ndistribution. Deposits from which the potash can be extracted at a\r\nreasonable cost, however, are known in only a few places, where they\r\nhave been formed as saline sediments.\r\n\r\nIn the decomposition of rocks the potash, like the soda, is readily\r\nsoluble, but in large part it is absorbed and held by clayey materials\r\nand is not carried off. Potash is therefore more sparingly present in\r\nriver and ocean waters than is soda, and deposits of potash salts are\r\nmuch rarer than those of rock salt and other sodium compounds. The large\r\ndeposits in the Permian beds of Stassfurt, as well as those in the\r\nTertiary of Alsace and Spain, have been formed by the evaporation of\r\nvery large quantities of salt water, presumably sea water. They consist\r\nof potassium salts, principally the chloride, mixed and\r\nintercrystallized with chlorides and sulphates of magnesium, sodium, and\r\ncalcium. In the Stassfurt deposits the potassium-magnesium salts occupy\r\na relatively thin horizon at the top of about 500 feet of rock salt\r\nbeds, the whole underlying an area about 200 miles long and 140 miles\r\nwide. The principal minerals in the potash horizon are carnallite\r\n(hydrous potassium-magnesium chloride), kieserite (hydrous magnesium\r\nsulphate), sylvite (potassium chloride), kainite (a hydrous double salt\r\nof potassium chloride and magnesium sulphate), and common salt (sodium\r\nchloride). The potash beds represent the last stage in the evaporation\r\nof the waters of a great closed basin, and the peculiar climatic and\r\ntopographic conditions which caused their formation have been the\r\nsubject of much speculation. This subject is further treated in the\r\ndiscussion of common salt beds (pp. 295-298).\r\n\r\nIn the United States the deposits at Searles Lake, California, have been\r\nproduced by the same processes on a smaller scale. In this case\r\nevaporation has not been carried to completion, but the crystallization\r\nand separation out of other salts has concentrated the potassium (with\r\nthe magnesium) in the residual brine or \"mother liquor.\" The deposits of\r\nthis lake or marsh also contain borax (see p. 276), and differ in\r\nproportions of salts from the Stassfurt deposits. This is due to the\r\nfact that they were probably derived, not from ocean waters, but from\r\nthe leaching of materials from the rocks of surrounding uplands,\r\ntransportation of these materials in solution by rivers and ground\r\nwaters, and concentration in the desert basin by evaporation.\r\n\r\nThe alkali lakes of Nebraska are believed to be of very recent geologic\r\norigin. They lie in depressions in a former sand dune area, and contain\r\nlarge quantities of potash supposedly accumulated by leaching of the\r\nashes resulting from repeated burnings of the grass in the adjacent\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nOf other natural mineral sources, alunite is the most important. The\r\nprincipal deposits worked are at Marysville, Utah, but the mineral is a\r\nrather common one in the western part of the United States, associated\r\nwith gold deposits, as at Goldfield, Nevada. Alunite occurs as veins and\r\nreplacement deposits, often in igneous associations, and is supposed to\r\nbe of igneous source. Its origin is referred to in connection with the\r\nGoldfield ores (p. 230).\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[15] Gale, Hoyt S., The potash deposits of Alsace: _Bull. 715-B, U. S.\r\nGeol.

It is the greatest of the energy\r\nsources--coal, petroleum, gas, and water power. Roughly two-thirds of\r\nthe world's coal is used for power, one-sixth for smelting and\r\nmetallurgical industries, and one-sixth for heating purposes. Coal\r\nconstitutes over one-third of the railroad tonnage of the United States\r\nand is the largest single tonnage factor in international trade; 70 per\r\ncent of the pre-war tonnage of outgoing cargoes from England was coal.\r\n\r\n=World production and trade.= The great coal-producing countries of the\r\nworld border the North Atlantic basin. The United States produces about\r\n40 per cent of the world's total, Great Britain about 20 per cent, and\r\nGermany about 20 per cent. Other countries producing coal stand in about\r\nthe following order: Austria-Hungary, France, Russia, Belgium, Japan,\r\nChina, India, Canada, and New South Wales. There is similarity in the\r\nmajor features of the distribution of coal production and of iron ore\r\nproduction. The great centers of coal production--the Pennsylvania and\r\nIllinois fields of the United States, the Midlands district of England,\r\nand the lower Rhine or Westphalian fields of Germany--are also the great\r\ncenters of the iron and steel industries of these countries. As in the\r\ncase of iron ore, there is rather a striking absence of important coal\r\nproduction in the southern hemisphere and in Asia. A significant item in\r\nthe world's distribution of coal supplies is England's world-wide system\r\nof coaling stations for shipping.\r\n\r\nThe principal coal-producing countries all have large reserves of coal.\r\nOutside of these countries the world's most important reserves are in\r\nChina, which may be looked to for great future development. For the most\r\npart, except for the probable Chinese development, it is likely that\r\ncountries now producing most of the coal will continue to do so in the\r\nfuture, and that outlying parts of the world will continue to be\r\nsupplied mainly from these countries.\r\n\r\nThe quantity and distribution of the coal reserves of the world have\r\nbeen estimated with perhaps a greater degree of accuracy than those of\r\nany other mineral resource. From these estimates it appears that the\r\nNorth American continent contains about half of the world reserves\r\n(principally in the United States, with lesser amounts in Canada) and\r\nAsia about one-fourth (principally in China, with some in India). Europe\r\ncontains only one-sixth of the world total, chiefly in the area of the\r\nformer German Empire and in Great Britain, with smaller quantities in\r\nRussia, Austria-Hungary, France, and Belgium. Australasia (New South\r\nWales), Africa (British South Africa), and South America (Chile, Brazil,\r\nPeru, and Colombia), together contain less than a tenth of the total\r\nreserves. Coal being one of the great bases for modern industrialism,\r\nthe large reserves of high grade-coals in China have led to the belief\r\nthat China may some day develop into a great manufacturing nation.\r\nSimilarly, the deficiency in coal of most of the South American and\r\nAfrican countries seems to preclude their developing any very large\r\nmanufacturing industries, except where water power is available. Coal\r\nreserves and the conservation of coal are further discussed in Chapter\r\nXVII.\r\n\r\nThe war resulted in considerable disturbances in coal production and\r\ndistribution. There has not yet been a return to normal conditions, and\r\nsome of the changes are probably permanent. The great overseas movement\r\nof coal from Germany was stopped and that from England curtailed. To\r\nsome extent the deficiency was supplied by coal exports from the United\r\nStates, particularly to South America. The shutting off of the normal\r\nGerman export to France and Mediterranean countries, the occupation of\r\nthe French and Belgian coal fields by the Germans, and the partial\r\nrestriction of German exports to Scandinavian countries, resulted in\r\nEurope's absorbing most of the British coal available for export, and in\r\naddition requiring coal from the United States. The stress in the\r\nworld's coal industry to meet the energy requirements of war is too\r\nrecent and vivid to require more than mention. The world was made to\r\nrealize almost for the first time the utterly vital and essential nature\r\nof this industry.\r\n\r\nSince the war, there has been a gradual resumption of England's export\r\nof coal along old lines of international trade. The German overseas\r\nexport trade has not been reestablished, and cannot be for a long time\r\nto come if Germany fulfills the terms of the Peace Treaty. Indeed,\r\nbecause of slow recovery in output of German coal, there is yet\r\nconsiderable lag in the supply available for European countries. The\r\nterms of the Peace Treaty lessened the territory of German coal reserves\r\nand required considerable additional contributions of coal to be\r\ndelivered to France, Belgium, Luxemburg, and Italy.\r\n\r\nThe increased export of coal from the United States during the war is\r\nlikely to be in part continued in the future, although the great bulk of\r\nthe United States production will in the future, as in the past, be\r\nabsorbed locally. Most of the coal in the United States available for\r\nexport is higher in volatile matter than the British and German export\r\ncoal. This quality will in some degree be a limiting factor in\r\nexportation. On the other hand, it may result in wider introduction of\r\nbriquetting, coking, and other processes, which will tend to improve the\r\nlocal industry and be conservational in their effect.\r\n\r\nJapan will doubtless hold some of the Asiatic coal market gained during\r\nthe war.\r\n\r\nInternational coal relations are further discussed in Chapter XVIII.[17]\r\n\r\n=Production in the United States.= The main features of the distribution\r\nof coal supplies in the United States are:\r\n\r\n(1) Localization of the anthracite production and reserves in a limited\r\narea in the Lawton region of Pennsylvania. Low-grade anthracite coal\r\nalso occurs in Rhode Island, North Carolina, Colorado, and Idaho.\r\n\r\n(2) Localization of the bituminous production in the eastern and\r\ninterior states of Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois,\r\nand Kentucky. The principal reserves of bituminous coal occur in the\r\nsame provinces, but important additional reserves are known in Texas, in\r\nNorth and South Carolina, and in the Rocky Mountain and Pacific Coast\r\nprovinces.\r\n\r\n(3) The existence of large tonnages of subbituminous coal in the west,\r\nwhich have not been mined to any extent.\r\n\r\n(4) The existence of large fields of lignite in the Gulf Coast region,\r\nand in the Northern Plains region, which have not been mined.\r\n\r\n=Coke.= About one-sixth of the bituminous coal mined in the United\r\nStates is made into _coke_, that is, it is subjected to heat in ovens\r\nfrom which oxygen is excluded in order to drive off the volatile gases\r\n(chiefly hydrocarbons and water) which constitute about 40 per cent of\r\nthe weight of the coal. The residual product, the coke, is a light,\r\nporous mass with a considerably higher percentage of fixed carbon than\r\nbituminous coal. In regard to composition, coking accomplishes\r\nartificially somewhat the same result reached by nature in its slow\r\ndevelopment of high-grade coals, but the texture of coke is far\r\ndifferent from that of coal. Not all bituminous coals are suitable for\r\ncoke manufacture; and such coals are frequently divided into two\r\nclasses, known as _coking_ and _non-coking_ coals. Coke is used\r\nprincipally for smelting purposes. Because of its spongy, porous\r\ntexture, it burns more rapidly and intensely than coal.\r\n\r\nThe gases eliminated in coking are wasted in the old-fashioned \"beehive\"\r\novens, but in modern \"by-product\" coke ovens these gases by proper\r\ntreatment yield valuable coal tar products and ammonia. It is estimated\r\nthat the sum of the value of the products thus recovered from a ton of\r\ncoal multiplies the value of the ton of coal at the mine by at least\r\nthirteen times. The importance of this fact from the conservational\r\nstandpoint cannot be too much emphasized. At present over half of the\r\ntotal coke produced in the United States comes from by-product ovens,\r\nand this proportion will doubtless increase in the future.\r\n\r\nBALANCE SHEET SHOWING CONTRAST BETWEEN VALUE OF 1 TON OF BITUMINOUS COAL\r\nAT MINE AND VALUE OF PRODUCTS WHICH IT CONTAINS, BASED ON CONDITIONS\r\nPREVAILING IN 1915.[1]\r\n\r\n  _Value at                                             _Value at point of\r\n  mine 1915_                _Quantity_                   production, 1915_\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  1 ton (2,000 pounds)     |(1,500 pounds smokeless fuel           $5.00[2]\r\n  bituminous coal          |(10,000 cubic feet gas, at\r\n  contains         $1.13   |        90c. per 1,000                  9.00[3]\r\n                           |(22 pounds ammonium sulphate at 2.8c.    .61\r\n                           |(2-1/2 gallons benzol, at 30c.           .75[4]\r\n                           |(9 gallons tar, at 2.6c.                 .23[4]\r\n  Total            $1.13[5]|                                      $15.59\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  1: Gilbert, Chester G., and Pogue, Joseph E., The energy resources of\r\n     the United States--A field for reconstruction: _Bull. 102, U.

Even if the cost of production\r\n     were eliminated, the price of coal would merely be a dollar less.\r\n\r\n=Classification of coals.= The accurate naming and classification of\r\ndifferent varieties of coal is not an easy matter. The three main\r\nclasses,--anthracite, bituminous, and lignite,--have group\r\ncharacteristics determined by their composition, color, texture, origin,\r\nand uses, and for general purposes these names have reasonably definite\r\nsignificance. However, there is complete gradation in coal materials\r\nfrom peat through lignite to bituminous and anthracite coals; many\r\nvarieties fall near the border lines of the main groups, and their\r\nspecific naming then becomes difficult. In addition, coal is made up of\r\nseveral substances which vary unequally in their proportions. It is\r\ndifficult to arrange all of these variables in a graded series in such a\r\nfashion as to permit of precise naming of the coal. Furthermore, the\r\nscientific naming of a coal may not serve the purpose of discriminating\r\ncoals used for different commercial purposes. Even the commercial names\r\nvary among themselves, depending on the use for which the coal is being\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\nThus it is that the naming and classification of coals is a perennial\r\nsource of difficulty and controversy. The earliest and most widely used\r\nclassification is based on the ratio between fixed (or non-volatile)\r\ncarbon and volatile constituents, called the \"fuel ratio.\" For this\r\npurpose \"proximate\" analyses of coal are made, in terms of fixed carbon,\r\nvolatile matter, moisture, ash, and sulphur. Anthracite has a higher\r\nfuel ratio than bituminous coal; that is, it has more fixed carbon in\r\nrelation to volatile matter. Similarly bituminous coal has a higher fuel\r\nratio than lignite. The fuel ratio measures roughly the heat or\r\ncalorific power of the coal, in other words, its fuel value. However,\r\nsome bituminous coals have a higher calorific power than some\r\nanthracites, because a large part of their volatile matter is\r\ncombustible and yields more heat than the corresponding weight of fixed\r\ncarbon in the anthracite. The fuel ratio pretty well discriminates coals\r\nof the higher ranks, and gives a classification corresponding roughly\r\nwith their commercial uses. For the lower ranks of coal it is not so\r\nsatisfactory, because the volatile constituents of such coals contain\r\nlarge and varying percentages of non-combustible hydrogen, oxygen, and\r\nnitrogen. Also such coals contain larger and more variable amounts of\r\nmoisture, which is inert to combustion and requires heat for its\r\nevaporation. Two coals of the lower ranks with the same fuel ratio may\r\nhave very different fuel qualities and different commercial uses,\r\nbecause of their different amounts of inert volatile matter and of\r\nwater. For these coals it is sometimes desirable to supplement the\r\nchemical classification by physical criteria. For instance,\r\nsubbituminous coal may be distinguished from lignite, not by its fuel\r\nratio alone, but by its shiny, black appearance as contrasted with the\r\ndull, woody appearance of lignite. Bituminous may be distinguished from\r\nsubbituminous by the manner of weathering. Other classifications have\r\nattempted to recognize these difficulties and still maintain a purely\r\nchemical basis by considering separately the combustible and\r\nnon-combustible volatile constituents. For this purpose, it is necessary\r\nto have not merely approximate analyses, but the ultimate analyses in\r\nterms of elements.\r\n\r\nDefinitions of the principal kinds of coal by Campbell,[18] of the\r\nUnited States Geological Survey, are as follows:\r\n\r\n     _Anthracite._ Anthracite is generally well known and may be\r\n     defined as a hard coal having a fuel ratio (fixed carbon\r\n     divided by the volatile matter) of not more than 50 or 60 and\r\n     not less than 10.\r\n\r\n     _Semianthracite._ Semianthracite is also a hard coal, but it\r\n     is not so hard as true anthracite. It is high in fixed carbon,\r\n     but not so high as anthracite. It may be defined as a hard\r\n     coal having a fuel ratio ranging from 6 to 10. The lower limit\r\n     is uncertain, as it is difficult to say where the line should\r\n     be drawn to separate \"hard\" from \"soft\" coal and at the same\r\n     time to divide the two ranks according to their fuel ratio.\r\n\r\n     _Semibituminous._ The name \"semibituminous\" is exceedingly\r\n     unfortunate, as literally it implies that this coal is half\r\n     the rank of bituminous, whereas it is applied to a kind of\r\n     coal that is of higher rank than bituminous--really\r\n     superbituminous. Semibituminous coal may be defined as coal\r\n     having a fuel ratio ranging from 3 to 7. Its relatively high\r\n     percentage of fixed carbon makes it nearly smokeless when it\r\n     is burned properly, and consequently most of these coals go\r\n     into the market as \"smokeless coals.\"\r\n\r\n     _Bituminous._ The term \"bituminous,\" as generally understood,\r\n     is applied to a group of coals having a maximum fuel ratio of\r\n     about 3, and hence it is a kind of coal in which the volatile\r\n     matter and the fixed carbon are nearly equal; but this\r\n     criterion cannot be used without qualification, for the same\r\n     statement might be made of subbituminous coal and lignite. As\r\n     noted before, the distinguishing feature which serves to\r\n     separate bituminous coal from coals of lower rank is the\r\n     manner in which it is affected by weathering.\r\n\r\n     _Subbituminous._ The term \"subbituminous\" is adopted by the\r\n     Geological Survey for what has generally been called \"black\r\n     lignite,\" a term that is objectionable because the coal is not\r\n     lignitic in the sense of being distinctly woody, and because\r\n     the use of the term seems to imply that this coal is little\r\n     better than the brown, woody lignite of North Dakota, whereas\r\n     many coals of this rank approach in excellence the lowest\r\n     grade of bituminous coal. Subbituminous coal is generally\r\n     distinguishable from lignite by its black color and its\r\n     apparent freedom from distinctly woody texture and structure,\r\n     and from bituminous coal by its loss of moisture and the\r\n     consequent breaking down of \"slacking\" that it undergoes when\r\n     subjected to alternate wetting and drying.\r\n\r\n     _Lignite._ The term \"lignite,\" as used by the Geological\r\n     Survey, is restricted to those coals which are distinctly\r\n     brown and either markedly woody or claylike in their\r\n     appearance. They are intermediate in quality and in\r\n     development between peat and subbituminous coal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.

After Campbell.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nGeologic features of coal may be conveniently described in terms of\r\norigin or genesis. Coal has essential features in common with asphalt,\r\noil, and gas. They are all composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen,\r\nwith minor quantities of other materials, combined in various\r\nproportions. They are all \"organic\" products which owe their origin to\r\nthe decay of the tissues of plants and perhaps animals. They have all\r\nbeen buried with other rocks beneath the surface. The common geologic\r\nprocesses affecting all rocks have in the main determined the evolution\r\nof these organic products and the forms in which we now find them.\r\nOriginating at the surface, they have participated in the constructive\r\nor anamorphic changes of the metamorphic cycle, which occur beneath the\r\nsurface, and under these influences have undergone various stages of\r\ncondensation, refinement, distillation, and hardening.\r\n\r\nAll stages in the development of coal have been traced. In brief, the\r\nstory is this:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6. Origin and development of coal. After\r\nGilbert.]\r\n\r\n     This exhibit shows the successive chemical stages in the\r\n     evolution of coal. The striking qualities of the original are\r\n     lost in the reproduction through the use of designs in the\r\n     place of realistic coloring, but the effect is retained\r\n     sufficiently to indicate the nature of the sequence and the\r\n     directness with which it leads back to an origin in vegetal\r\n     accumulations. The evolutionary process is seen to take the\r\n     form of increasing density through the progressive expulsion\r\n     of volatilizable matters in the course of geologic time. This\r\n     inference is substantiated beyond reasonable question by the\r\n     actual presence of organic remains in coal beds.\r\n\r\nGrasses, trees, and other plants growing in swamps and bogs decay and\r\nform a vegetable mold in the nature of _peat_. A peat bog from the top\r\ndownward consists of (1) living plants, (2) dead plants, and (3) a dense\r\nbrownish-black mass, of decayed and condensed vegetable material, in\r\nwhich the vegetable structure is more or less indistinct. Peat consists\r\nchiefly of fixed carbon and volatile matter, also of sulphur, moisture,\r\nand ash. The volatile matter consists mainly of various combinations of\r\nhydrogen and carbon, called hydrocarbons; it goes off in gas or smoke\r\nwhen the peat is heated to a red heat. The fixed carbon is the carbon\r\nleft after the volatile matter has been driven off. The ash represents\r\nthe more incombustible mineral matter, usually of the nature of clay or\r\nslate. The moisture in peat may be as high as 90 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe essential condition for thick accumulation of peat seems to be\r\nabundance of moisture, which favors luxuriant growth and protects the\r\nplant remains from complete oxidation or decay. Without moisture the\r\nvegetable material would completely oxidize, leaving practically no\r\nresidue, as it does in dry climates. For the formation of thick peat\r\nbeds, there seems to be implied some sort of a balance between the slow\r\nbuilding up of organic accumulations and the settling of the area to\r\nkeep it near the elevation of the water table. Present day bog deposits\r\nare known in some cases to have a thickness of forty feet. This\r\nthickness is not enough to account for some of the great coal seams\r\nwithin the earth; but there seems to be no escape from the conclusion\r\nthat the same sort of deposits, formed on a larger scale in the past,\r\nwere the first step in the formation of the coal seams. Flat, swampy\r\ncoastal plains are believed to furnish the best conditions for thick\r\naccumulation of peat. There is good evidence that most of the deposits\r\naccumulate essentially in place, without appreciable transportation.\r\n\r\nIn time these surface accumulations of vegetable material may subside\r\nand be buried under clay, sand, or other rock materials. The processes\r\nof condensation begun in the peat bog are then carried further. They\r\nresult in the second stage of coal formation, that of _lignite_ or\r\n_brown coal_. This is brown, woody in texture, and has a brown streak.\r\nIt has a higher percentage of fixed carbon, and less volatile matter and\r\nwater, than peat.\r\n\r\nContinuation of the processes of induration produces _subbituminous\r\ncoal_, or _black lignite_, which is usually black and sometimes has a\r\nfairly bright luster. It is sometimes distinguished from bituminous\r\ncoal, where weathered or dried, by the manner in which it checks\r\nirregularly or splits parallel to the bedding,--the characteristic\r\nfeature of bituminous coal being columnar fracture.\r\n\r\nThe next stage in coal formation is _bituminous coal_. It has greater\r\ndensity than the lignites or subbituminous coals, is black, more\r\nbrittle, and breaks with a cubical or conchoidal fracture. It is higher\r\nin fixed carbon, lower in volatile matter and water. A variety of\r\nbituminous coal, called _cannel coal_, is characterized by an unusually\r\nhigh percentage of volatile matter, which causes it to ignite easily.\r\nThis material has a dull luster and a conchoidal fracture. It is\r\ncomposed almost entirely of the spores and spore cases, which are\r\nresinous or waxy products, of such plants as lived in the parent coal\r\nswamp.\r\n\r\nThere are gradations from bituminous coal into _anthracite coal_.\r\n_Semibituminous_ and _semianthracite_ are names used to some extent for\r\nthese intermediate varieties. The final stage of coal formation is\r\nanthracite,--hard, brittle, black, with high luster and conchoidal\r\nfracture. It has a higher percentage of fixed carbon and correspondingly\r\nless of the volatile constituents, than any of the other coals.\r\n\r\nThe coals form a completely graded series from peat to the hard\r\nanthracite. Comparison of the compositions of the coal materials at\r\ndifferent stages shows clearly what has happened. Moisture has\r\ndiminished, certain volatile hydrocarbons have been eliminated as gases,\r\nand oxygen has decreased. On the other hand, the residual fixed carbon,\r\nsulphur, and usually ash, have remained in higher percentage. This\r\nchange in composition is graphically represented in Figure 6.\r\n\r\nDuring this process volume has been progressively reduced and density\r\nincreased. Five feet of wood or plant may produce about one foot of\r\nbituminous coal, or six-tenths of a foot of anthracite.\r\n\r\nThe exact physical conditions in the earth which determine the\r\nprogressive changes in coals, above outlined, cannot be fully specified.\r\nTime is one of the factors--the longer the time, the greater the\r\nopportunity for accomplishing these results. Another factor is\r\nundoubtedly pressure, due to the weight of overlying sediments, or to\r\nearth movements. In peat condensational changes of this nature are\r\naccomplished artificially by the pressure of briquetting machines.\r\nAnother factor is believed to be the heat developed by earth movements\r\nand vulcanism, which presumably facilitates the elimination of volatile\r\nmaterials, and thus accelerates the gradational changes above\r\ndescribed. This is suggested by the fact that in places where hot\r\nvolcanic lavas have gone through coal beds they have locally produced\r\ncoals of anthracitic and coke-like varieties. In general, however, it\r\nhas not been possible to determine the degree to which heat has been\r\nresponsible for the changes. Coals which have been developed in\r\ndifferent localities, under what seem to be much the same heat\r\nconditions, may show quite different degrees of progress toward the\r\nanthracite stage. Another factor that has been suggested as possibly\r\ncontributing to the change, is the degree of permeability of the rocks\r\noverlying the coal to the volatile materials which escape from the coal\r\nduring its refinement. It is argued that in areas of folding or of\r\nbrittle rock where the cover is cracked, volatile gases have a better\r\nchance to escape, and that the change toward anthracite is likely to\r\nadvance further here than elsewhere.\r\n\r\nBacterial action is an important factor in the earlier stages, in the\r\npartial decay of vegetable matter to form peat; accumulation of waste\r\nproducts from this action, however, appears to inhibit further bacterial\r\nactivity.\r\n\r\nCoal deposits have the primary shapes of sedimentary beds. They are\r\nordinarily thin and tabular, and broadly lenticular,--on true scale\r\nbeing like sheets of thin paper. At a maximum they seldom run over 100\r\nfeet in thickness, and they average less than 10 feet. Seldom is a\r\nworkable coal bed entirely alone; there are likely to be several\r\nsuperposed and overlapping seams of coal, separated by sandstones,\r\nshales, or other rocks. In Illinois and Indiana there are nine workable\r\ncoal seams, in Pennsylvania in some places about twenty, and in Wales\r\nthere are over one hundred, many of which are worked. Some of the seams\r\nare of very limited extent; others are remarkably persistent, one seam\r\nin Pennsylvania having an average thickness of 6 to 10 feet over about\r\n6,000 square miles of its area. Only 2 per cent of the coal-bearing\r\nmeasures of the eastern United States is actually coal.\r\n\r\nEven where not subsequently disturbed by deformation, coal beds are not\r\nfree from structural irregularity. They are originally deposited in\r\nvariable thicknesses on irregular surfaces. During their consolidation\r\nthere is a great reduction of volume, resulting in minor faults and\r\nfolds. Subsequent deformation by earth forces may develop further faults\r\nand folds, with the result that the convolutions of a coal bed may be\r\nvery complex. The beds of a coal-bearing series are usually of differing\r\nthickness and competency, and as a consequence they do not take the same\r\nforms under folding. Shearing between the beds may result in an\r\nintricate outline for one bed, while the beds above and below may have\r\nmuch more simple outlines. In short, the following of a coal seam\r\nrequires at almost every stage the application of principles of\r\nstructural geology. It is obvious, also, that the identification and\r\nlocation of sedimentary geologic horizons are essential, and hence the\r\napplication of principles of stratigraphy.\r\n\r\nThe folios of the United States Geological Survey on coal-bearing areas\r\npresent highly developed methods of mapping and representing the\r\ngeologic features of coal beds. On the surface map are indicated the\r\ntopography, the geologic horizons, and the lines of outcrop of the coal\r\nseams. In addition, there are indicated the sub-surface contours of one\r\nor more of the coal seams which are selected as datum horizons. The\r\nsub-surface structure, even though complex, can be readily read from one\r\nof these surface maps. With the addition of suitable cross sections and\r\ncomparative columnar sections, the story is made complete. In the study\r\nof the occurrence of coal seams, the reader cannot do better than\r\nfamiliarize himself with one or more of the Geological Survey folios.\r\n\r\nThe high-grade coals of the eastern and central United States are found\r\nin rocks of Carboniferous age. The very name Carboniferous originated in\r\nthe fact that the rocks of this geologic period contain productive coal\r\nbeds in so many parts of the world. The coal measures of Great Britain,\r\nof Germany, Belgium, and northern France, of Russia, and the largest\r\ncoal beds of China are all of Carboniferous age. Deposits of this period\r\ninclude the bulk of the world's anthracite and high-grade bituminous\r\ncoal. Coal deposits of more recent age are numerous, but in general they\r\nhave had less time in which to undergo the processes of condensation and\r\nrefinement, and hence their general grade is lower. In the western\r\nUnited States there are great quantities of subbituminous coal of\r\nCretaceous age, and of Tertiary lignites which have locally been\r\nconverted by mountain upbuilding into bituminous and semibituminous\r\ncoals. Jurassic coals are known in many parts of the world outside of\r\nNorth America, and lignites of Tertiary age are widely distributed\r\nthrough Asia and Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\nPETROLEUM\r\n\r\n\r\nECONOMIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nPetroleum is second only to coal as an energy resource. The rapid\r\nacceleration in demand from the automobile industry and in the use of\r\nfuel oil for power seems to be limited only by the amounts of raw\r\nmaterial available.\r\n\r\n=Production and reserves.= The distribution by countries of the present\r\nannual production of petroleum, the past total production, and the\r\nestimated reserves, is indicated in terms of percentages of the world's\r\ntotal in the table[19] on the opposite page.\r\n\r\nThis table indicates the great dominance of the United States both in\r\npresent and past production of petroleum, as well as the concentration\r\nof the industry in a few countries. In addition the United States\r\ncontrols much of the Mexican production as well as production in other\r\nparts of the world, making its total control of production at least 70\r\nper cent. of the world's total. Notwithstanding its large domestic\r\nproduction, the United States has recently consumed more oil than it\r\nproduces. Imports of crude oil are about balanced by exports of\r\nkerosene, fuel oils, lubricants, etc. The per capita consumption of\r\npetroleum in the United States is said to be twenty times greater than\r\nin England. On the other hand, the remaining principal producers consume\r\nfar less than they produce, the excess being exported.\r\n\r\nThe oil from the United States, Russia, the Dutch East Indies, India,\r\nRoumania, and Galicia is for the most part treated at refineries near\r\nthe source of supply or at tidewater, and exports consist of refined\r\nproducts. The Mexican oil is largely exported in crude form to the\r\nUnited States though increasing quantities are being refined within\r\nMexico.\r\n\r\nThe figures shown in the table for oil reserves are of course the\r\nroughest approximations, particularly for some of the less explored\r\ncountries. However, they are compiled from the best available sources\r\nand may serve at least to show the apparent relative positions of the\r\ndifferent countries at this time. Further exploration is likely to\r\nchange the percentages and add very greatly to the totals. The\r\nsignificant feature of these figures is the contrast which they indicate\r\nbetween distribution of reserves and distribution of past production.\r\nParticularly do they show that the reserves of the United States, which\r\nare more closely estimated than those of any other country, are in a far\r\nlower ratio to past production than are the reserves in other countries.\r\nIt was estimated in 1920 that about 40 per cent of the United States\r\nreserves are exhausted.[20]\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESENT AND PAST PRODUCTION AND RESERVES OF OIL, BY COUNTRIES, IN TERMS\r\nOF PERCENTAGE OF WORLD'S TOTAL\r\n\r\n  -------------------------+--------------+--------------+-------------\r\n                           |              |  _Per cent   | _Per cent\r\n      Country              |_Per cent of  |   of total   |  of total\r\n                           | production,  |  production, |   oil\r\n                           |   1918_      |  1857-1918_  | resources_\r\n  -------------------------+--------------+--------------+-------------\r\n  United States and Alaska |    69.15     |    61.42     |    16.26\r\n  Mexico                   |    12.40     |     3.80     |    10.51\r\n  Russia (southeastern     |              |              |\r\n    Russia, southwestern   |              |              |\r\n    Siberia, region of the |              |              |\r\n    Caucasus, northern     |              |              |\r\n    Russia, and Saghalien) |     7.86     |    24.96     |    15.69\r\n  East Indies              |     2.58     |     2.51     |     7.00\r\n  Roumania, Galicia, and   |              |              |\r\n    western Europe         |     2.79     |     4.07     |     2.64\r\n  India                    |     1.55     |     1.41     |     2.31\r\n  Persia and Mesopotamia   |     1.40     |      .19     |    13.52\r\n  Japan and Formosa        |      .48     |      .51     |     2.87\r\n  Egypt and Algeria        |      .40     |      .07     |     2.15\r\n  Germany                  |      .14     |      .22     |      --\r\n  Canada                   |      .06     |      .33     |     2.31\r\n  Northern South America,  |              |              |\r\n    including Peru,        |              |              |\r\n    Trinidad and Venezuela |      .93     |      .43     |    13.31\r\n  Southern South America,  |              |              |\r\n    including Bolivia and  |              |              |\r\n    Argentina              |      .26     |      .06     |     8.24\r\n  China                    |      --      |      --      |     3.19\r\n  Italy                    |       }      |              |\r\n  Cuba                     |       }      |      .02     |\r\n  Other countries          |       }      |              |\r\n                           |   ------     |   ------     |   ------\r\n  World total              |   100.00     |   100.00     |   100.00\r\n  -------------------------+--------------+--------------+-------------\r\n\r\nLooking forward to the future, it is clear that there will be\r\nconsiderable shifts in the centers of principal production of petroleum\r\nin the directions indicated by the reserve figures. In particular,\r\nconspicuous development of production may be expected in the immediate\r\nfuture in the countries bordering the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of\r\nMexico. In the eastern hemisphere production is rapidly increasing in\r\nPersia and Mesopotamia; and Russia, with the stabilization of political\r\nconditions, may become ultimately the world's leading oil producer. At\r\nthe now indicated rate of production, world reserves now estimated would\r\nbe exhausted in eighty-six years and the peak of production would be\r\npassed earlier. With continuing acceleration of production, total\r\nreserves would be exhausted in considerably less time,--providing\r\nphysical conditions would allow the oil to be pumped from the ground at\r\nthe necessary speed, which they probably will not. These figures taken\r\nat face value are alarming; but the earth offers such huge possibilities\r\nfor further discoveries that the life of oil reserves above indicated is\r\nlikely to be considerably extended. At many times in the history of the\r\nmineral industry the end has apparently been in sight for certain\r\nproducts; but with the increased demand for these products has come\r\nincreased activity in exploration, with the result that as yet no\r\ndefinite end has been approached for any one of them. The more immediate\r\nproblems of the petroleum industry seem to the writer to be of rather\r\ndifferent nature: first, whether the discovery and winning of the oil\r\ncan be made to keep pace with the enormous acceleration of demand; and\r\nsecond, the adjustment of political and financial control of oil\r\nresources, the possession of which is becoming so increasingly vital to\r\nnational prosperity.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the first question, it is a much more difficult problem\r\ntoday to locate and develop a supply of oil to replace the annual world\r\nproduction (recently half a billion barrels), than it was twenty years\r\nago, when it was necessary for this purpose to find only one-fifth this\r\namount; and if the demand is unchecked, it will be still more difficult\r\nto replace the three-quarters of a billion barrels of oil which will\r\ndoubtless be required in a very few years. Regardless of the amount of\r\noil actually in the ground, it is entirely possible that physical\r\nlimitations on its rate of discovery and recovery will prevent its being\r\nmade available as fast as necessary to meet the increasing demand. This\r\nfact is likely to make itself felt through increase of price. Other\r\nnatural results should be the development of substitutes, such as\r\nalcohol or benzol for gasoline; the larger recovery of oil from oil\r\nshales; and the general speeding up of conservational measures of\r\nvarious kinds. These are all palliatives and not essential remedies. To\r\nmake enough alcohol to substitute for the gasoline now coming from oil\r\nwould use a very considerable fraction of the world's food supply. To\r\nmake enough benzol (a by-product of coke) to replace gasoline would\r\nnecessitate the manufacture of many times the amount of coke now\r\nrequired by the world's industries. To develop the oil shale industry to\r\na point where it could supply anything like the amount of oil now\r\nderived from oil pools would mean the building of great plants,\r\nincluding towns, railroads, and other equipment, equivalent to the\r\nplants of the coal mining industry. To apply any one of the various\r\nconservational measures discussed on later pages would only temporarily\r\nalleviate the situation.\r\n\r\nThe question of political and financial control of oil supplies may be\r\nillustrated by particular reference to the United States. On present\r\nfigures it appears that within three to five years the peak of\r\nproduction in this country will be passed; and at the present rate of\r\nproduction the life of the reserves may not be over seventeen to twenty\r\nyears. Of course production could not continue to the end at this rate,\r\nand the actual life will necessarily be longer. Again the doubtful\r\nfactor is the possibility for further discoveries. Many favorable\r\nstructures have been mapped which have not yet been drilled, and there\r\nare considerable unexplored areas where the outcrops are so few that\r\nthere is no clue at the surface to the location of favorable structures.\r\nThe future is likely to see a considerable amount of shallow drilling\r\nfor the sole purpose of geological reconnaissance. For upwards of ten\r\nyears important parts of the public domain have not been available for\r\nexploration, but Congress has now enacted legislation which opens up\r\nvast territories for this purpose.\r\n\r\nEven with large allowance for these possibilities, it seems unlikely\r\nthat production in the United States can increase very long at the\r\naccelerating rate of the domestic demand, which is already in excess of\r\ndomestic production. The supplies of Mexico are in a large part\r\ncontrolled by American capital and are thus made available to the\r\nUnited States (subject, of course, to political conditions); but even\r\nwith these added, the United States is in a somewhat unfavorable\r\nsituation as compared with certain other countries. This situation is\r\ndirecting attention to the possibility of curtailment of oil exports,\r\nand to the possibility of acquiring additional oil supplies in foreign\r\ncountries. In this quest the United States is peculiarly handicapped in\r\nthat most foreign countries, in recognition of the vital national\r\nimportance of the oil resource, have imposed severe restrictions on\r\nexploration by outsiders. Nationals of the United States are excluded\r\nfrom acquiring oil concessions, or permitted to do so only under\r\nconditions which invalidate control, in the British Empire, France,\r\nJapan, Netherlands, and elsewhere, and the current is still moving\r\nstrong in the direction of further exclusion. As the United States\r\nfields are yet open to all comers, it has been suggested that some\r\nrestriction by the United States might be necessary for purposes of\r\nself-protection, or as an aid in securing access to foreign fields. The\r\nactivity of England during and since the war has increased the amount of\r\noil controlled by that country from an insignificant quantity to\r\npotentially over half of the world's oil reserves. The problem of future\r\noil supplies for the United States presents an acute phase of the\r\ngeneral question of government cooperation or participation in mineral\r\nindustries, which is further discussed in Chapter XVIII.\r\n\r\nThe following table summarizes the distribution of the oil production in\r\nthe United States, together with the salient features of its geologic\r\ndistribution and character.\r\n\r\nThis table, in conjunction with Fig. 8 below, shows clearly that the\r\nbulk of the United States production of oil comes from two great\r\nsources--the Pennsylvanian sandstones of the Mid-Continent field in\r\nKansas and Oklahoma, and the Cretaceous and Tertiary sediments of the\r\nsouthern half of California. Phenomenal development of the Central and\r\nNorth Texas field in 1919 increased its yield to about one-sixth of the\r\ncountry's total. The older Appalachian oil field, extending from New\r\nYork to West Virginia and Tennessee, was the earliest area discovered;\r\nit is still one of the more productive fields, though it has long since\r\npassed its maximum production. The other principal sources of oil are\r\nthe Gulf Coast field in Louisiana and Texas, the North Louisiana field,\r\nthe southern Illinois field, and the Rocky Mountain region. This last\r\nregion, containing large amounts of government land recently opened to\r\nexploration, bids fair to produce increasing quantities of oil for some\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nPAST PRODUCTION OF PETROLEUM IN THE UNITED STATES.

Chart showing the present tendency of\r\nthe United States in respect to its unmined reserve of petroleum. Data\r\nfrom U.S. Geological Survey. After Gilbert and Pogue.]\r\n\r\n=Methods of estimating reserves.= It may be of interest to inquire into\r\nthe basis on which predictions are made of the life of an oil pool. The\r\nprocess is essentially a matter of platting curves of production, and of\r\nprojecting them into the future with the approximate slopes exhibited in\r\ndistricts which are already approaching exhaustion.[21] While no two\r\nwells or two districts act exactly alike, these curves have group\r\ncharacteristics which are used as a rough basis for interpreting the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8. The annual output of the principal oil\r\nfields of the United States for the last twenty years. Data from U.S.\r\nGeological Survey.]\r\n\r\nA less reliable method is to calculate from geologic data the volume and\r\nporosity of the oil-bearing reservoirs, and to estimate the percentage\r\nof recovery on the basis of current practices and conditions. Complete\r\ndata for this method are often not available; but in the early years of\r\na field, before production curves are established, this method may serve\r\nfor a rough approximation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9. Curve showing the usual decline in oil\r\nfield production after the period of maximum output is reached. After\r\nRalph Arnold. The Petroleum Resources of the United States, Smithsonian\r\nreport for 1916, p. 283. Compare this theoretical curve of final\r\ndecrease with the production curve shown in Fig. 8.]\r\n\r\n=Classes of oils.= When crude petroleum is distilled, it gives off in\r\nsuccession various substances and gradually thickens until it leaves a\r\nsolid residue, which may be largely either paraffin wax or asphalt. The\r\ntwo main classes of oils are determined by the nature of this solid\r\nresidual. The products given off are natural gas and then liquid\r\nhydrocarbons of various kinds, which evaporate in the order of their\r\nlightness. Petroleum is thus a mixture or mutual solution of different\r\nliquids, gases, and solids. Nearly one-fifth of the domestic consumption\r\nof crude petroleum is burned directly as fuel, and four-fifths are\r\nrefined. The several principal primary products of refinement are\r\ngasoline, kerosene, fuel oil, and lubricating oil; but these may be\r\nbroken up into other substances, each the starting point of further\r\nrefinements, with the result that present commercial practice yields\r\nseveral hundred substances of commercial value. With increasing chemical\r\nand technical knowledge these products are being multiplied. The rapidly\r\nincreasing demand for gasoline has led to the use of processes which\r\nextract a large proportion of this substance from the raw material, by\r\n\"cracking\" or breaking up other substances; but while, under the stress\r\nof necessity, there is possibility of slight modification of the\r\nproportions of principal substances extracted from the crude oil, it is\r\nnot possible to change these proportions essentially. It is, therefore,\r\na problem to adjust relative demands to supplies of the different\r\nproducts. The domestic demand for gasoline is greater than the supply.\r\nOn the other hand, the demand for kerosene, which must be produced at\r\nthe same time, is much less than the domestic supply. Hence the\r\nimportance of maintaining export markets for kerosene.\r\n\r\nThe nature or grade of the oil of various fields is an important matter\r\nin considering reserves for the future. Perhaps half of the United\r\nStates reserves consist of the asphalt-base oils of the California and\r\ncertain of the Gulf fields, which yield comparatively small amounts of\r\ngasoline and other valuable light products, though they are very\r\nsatisfactory for fuel purposes. Similarly the large reserve tonnages of\r\noil in Mexico and the Caribbean countries, in Peru, and probably in\r\nRussia, are essentially of the heavier, lower grade oils. The oils of\r\nthe Mid-Continental and eastern fields of the United States, of Ontario,\r\nof the Dutch East Indies, of Burma, and of Persia and Mesopotamia are\r\nreported to be largely of the paraffin base type, which, because of its\r\nlarger yield of gasoline and light oils, is at present considerably more\r\nvaluable. These generalizations are of course subject to qualifications,\r\nin that the oils of a given region may vary considerably, and that some\r\noils are intermediate in character, containing both asphalt and paraffin\r\nwax.\r\n\r\n=Conservation of oil.= The rapid increase in demand for oil as compared\r\nwith discovery of new sources is leading naturally to a more intensive\r\nstudy of the conservational aspects of the industry. This is a complex\r\nand difficult subject which we shall not take up in detail, but we may\r\npoint out some of the phases of the problem which are receiving especial\r\nattention.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.

Efforts are\r\nbeing made along various lines to increase the percentage of\r\nrecovery,--as, for instance, in preventing infiltration of water to the\r\noil beds and in the use of artificial pressures and better pumping.\r\n\"Casing-head gasoline\" is being recovered to an increasing extent from\r\nthe natural gas which was formerly allowed to dissipate in the air.\r\n\r\nMinute division of the ownership of a pool, with consequent\r\nmultiplication of wells and unrestricted competition, tends to gross\r\nover-production and highly wasteful methods. The more rapid exhaustion\r\nof one well than the others may result in the flooding of the oil sands\r\nby salt waters coming in from below. Various efforts have been made\r\ntoward a more systematic and coordinated development of oil fields.\r\n\r\nIn general, the organization and technique involved in the development\r\nof an oil field are improving in the direction of extracting a greater\r\npercentage of the total available oil.\r\n\r\nBetter methods of refining the oil, and the refining of a larger\r\npercentage of the crude oil, make the oil more available for a greater\r\nvariety of purposes and therefore more valuable. Great advances have\r\nbeen made along these lines, particularly in the application of the\r\n\"cracking\" method for a greater recovery of the more valuable light oils\r\nat the expense of the less valuable heavy oils. Similarly, modifications\r\nof internal combustion engines will probably permit the use, in an\r\nincreasing number of cases, of products of lower volatility than\r\ngasoline.\r\n\r\nOne of the conservational advances in coming years will probably be a\r\nrestriction in the amount of crude oil used directly for fuel and road\r\npurposes without refining. These crude uses cut down the output of much\r\ndesired products from the distillation of the oil. Various other\r\nrestrictions in the use of oil have been proposed, such as the\r\ncurtailment of the use of gasoline in pleasure cars. The gasless Sundays\r\nduring the war represented an attempt of this kind. In general, it seems\r\nlikely that such restrictions will come mainly through increase in the\r\nprice of oil products.\r\n\r\nThe substitution of oil from oil shales, and of alcohol for gasolene,\r\nalready mentioned, will be conservational so far as the oil is\r\nconcerned, though perhaps not so in regard to other elements of the\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGIC FEATURES\r\n\r\n=Organic theory of origin.= According to this theory, accumulations of\r\norganic materials in sedimentary beds, usually muds or marls, have been\r\nslowly altered and distilled during geologic ages; the products of\r\ndistillation have migrated chiefly upward to porous strata like\r\nsandstones or cavernous limestones, where, under suitable conditions,\r\nthey have become trapped.\r\n\r\nThe original organic material is believed to have been plants of low\r\norder and animal organisms (such as foraminifera) which were deposited\r\nas organic detritus with mud and marl in the bottoms of ponds, lakes,\r\nestuaries, and on the sea bottom,--in both salt and fresh waters.\r\nBacteria are supposed to have played a part in the early stage of\r\nalteration, sometimes called the biochemical stage. When the organic\r\nmatter was buried under later sediments and subjected to pressure,\r\nphysical conditions were responsible for further volatilization or\r\ndistillation. This stage is called the geochemical stage. There is much\r\nin common as to origin between coal, oil shales, and petroleum.\r\nAccording to White,[22]\r\n\r\n     whether the ingredient organic matter, be it plant or animal,\r\n     will be in part transformed to coal of the ordinary type, to\r\n     cannel, to oil shale, to the organic residues in so-called\r\n     bituminous shales and carbonaceous shales, or to petroleum and\r\n     natural gas, is dependent upon the composition of the\r\n     ingredient organic debris, the conditions of its accumulation\r\n     or deposition, and the extent of the microbian action.\r\n\r\nWhite has further developed the important principle that, in the\r\ngeochemical stage of development, both coal and oil react to physical\r\ninfluences in much the same way; and that therefore when both are found\r\nin the same geologic series, the degree of concentration of the coal,\r\nmeasured by its percentage of carbon, may be an indication of the stage\r\nof development of the oil. More specifically where the coal contains\r\nmore than 65 to 70 per cent of fixed carbon, chances for finding oil in\r\nthe vicinity are not good (though commercial gaspools may be found),\r\nprobably for the reason that the geochemical processes of distillation\r\nhave gone so far as to volatilize the oils, leaving the solid residues\r\nin the rock. White also finds that the lowest rank oils, with\r\nconsiderable asphalt, are found in regions and formations where the\r\ncoal deposits are the least altered, and the lighter, higher rank oils,\r\non the whole, where the coal has been brought to the correspondingly\r\nhigher ranks; in other words, up to the point of complete elimination of\r\nthe oil, improvement in quality of the oil accompanies increased\r\ncarbonization of the coal. The principle, therefore, becomes useful in\r\nexploration in geologic series where oil is associated with coal. Where\r\nthe coal is in one series and the oil in another, separated by\r\nunconformity (indicating different conditions of development), the\r\nprinciple may not hold, even though there is close geographical\r\nassociation.\r\n\r\nThe oil and gas distillates migrate upward under gas pressure and under\r\npressure of the ground-water. If there are no overlying impervious beds\r\nto furnish suitable trapping conditions, or conditions to retard the\r\nflow, the oil may be lost. The conditions favorable for trapping are\r\noverlying impervious beds bowed into anticlines, or other structural\r\nirregularities, due either to secondary deformation or to original\r\ndeposition, which may arrest the oil in its upward course. A dome-like\r\nstructure or anticline may be due to stresses which have buckled up the\r\nbeds, or to unequal settling of sediments varying in character or\r\nthickness; thus some of the anticlinal structures of the Mid-Continent\r\nfield may be due to settling of shaley sediments around less\r\ncompressible lenses of sandstone which may act as oil reservoirs, or\r\naround islands which stood above the seas in which the oil-bearing\r\nsediments were deposited and on the shores of which sands capable of\r\nacting as oil reservoirs were laid down. Favorable conditions for\r\ntrapping the oil may be furnished by impervious clay \"gouges\" along\r\nfault planes, or by dikes of igneous rock. Favorable conditions may also\r\nbe merely differences in porosity of beds in irregular zones, determined\r\nby differences either in original deposition or in later cementation.\r\n\r\nThe thickness of oil-producing strata may vary between 2 or 3 feet and\r\n200 feet. The porosity varies between 5 and 50 per cent. In sandstones\r\nthe average is from 5 to 15 per cent. In shales and clays, which are\r\ncommonly the impervious \"cap-rocks,\" porosity may be equally high, but\r\nthe pores are too small and discontinuous to permit movement.\r\n\r\nWhen the impervious capping is punctured by a drill hole, gas is likely\r\nto be first encountered, then oil, and then water, which is usually\r\nsalty. The gas pressure is often released with almost explosive\r\nviolence, which has suggested that this is an important cause of the\r\nunderground pressures. It has been supposed also that the pressures are\r\npartly those of artesian flows. The vertical arrangement of oil, gas,\r\nand water under the impervious capping is the result of the lighter\r\nmaterials rising to the top. In certain fields, oil and gas have been\r\nfound in the tops of anticlines in water-saturated rocks, and farther\r\ndown the flanks of folds or in synclines in unsaturated rocks.\r\n\r\nThe localization of oil pools is evidently determined partly by original\r\norganic deposition, often in alignment with old shore lines, and partly\r\nby the structural, textural, and other conditions which trap the oil in\r\nits migration from the source.\r\n\r\n=Effect of differential pressures and folding on oil genesis and\r\nmigration.= Another organic hypothesis proposed somewhat recently[23] is\r\nthat oil is formed by differential movement or shearing in bituminous\r\nshales, which are often in close relationship with the producing sand of\r\nan oil field, and that the movement of oil to the adjacent sands is\r\naccomplished by capillary pressure of water and not by ordinary free\r\ncirculation of water under gravity. The capillary forces have been shown\r\nto be strong enough to hold the oil in the larger pores against the\r\ninfluence of gravity and circulation. The accumulation of the oil into\r\ncommercial pools is supposed to take place in local areas where the\r\noil-soaked shale, due to jointing or faulting, is in direct contact with\r\nthe water of the reservoir rock. This suggests lack of wide migration.\r\nThis hypothesis is based on experimental work with bituminous shales.\r\nThe general association of oil pools with anticlinal areas is explained\r\non the assumption that anticlines on the whole are areas of maximum\r\ndifferential movement, resulting in oil distillation, and that they are\r\nordinarily accompanied by tension joints or faults, affording the\r\nconditions for oil migration. Data are insufficient, however, to\r\nindicate the extent to which the anticlinal areas are really areas of\r\nmaximum shearing. As regards the exact nature of the process, it is not\r\nclear to what extent differential movement may involve increase in\r\ntemperature which may be the controlling factor in distillation,--although\r\nin McCoy's experiment oil was formed when no appreciable amount of heat\r\nwas generated.\r\n\r\nThe development of petroleum by pressure alone acting on unaltered\r\nshale, as shown by these experiments, has been taken by White[24] to\r\nhave a significant bearing on the geochemical processes of oil\r\nformation. Under differential stresses acting on fine-grained\r\ncarbonaceous strata under sufficient load, there is considerable\r\nmolecular rearrangement, as well as actual movement of the rock\r\ngrains,--thus promoting the distillation of oil and gas from the organic\r\nmatter in the rocks, and the squeezing out of the oil, gas, and water\r\ninto adjacent rocks, such as coarse round-grained sandstones and porous\r\nlimestones, which are more resistant to change of volume under pressure.\r\nMigration, concentration and segregation of the oil, gas, and water is\r\nsupposed to be brought about, partly through the effect of capillary\r\nforces--the water, by reason of its greater capillary tension, tending\r\nto seize and hold the smaller voids, and thus driving the oil and gas\r\ninto the larger ones--and partly through the action of gravity.\r\n\r\nWhite also suggests that the process may go further where the parent\r\ncarbonaceous strata are of such thickness and under such load of\r\noverlying rocks that they undergo considerable interior adjustment and\r\nvolume change before yielding to stress by anticlinal buckling,--than\r\nwhere the strata yield quickly. It is not clear to the writer that the\r\ninterior adjustment assumed under this hypothesis is necessarily slowed\r\nup or stopped by anticlinal buckling. Interior stresses are inherent in\r\nany sedimentary formation, when settling and consolidating and\r\nrecrystallizing under gravity, and these may be independent of regional\r\nthrusts from without.\r\n\r\nThe first oils evolved by pressure from the organic mother substance are\r\nprobably heavy, the later oils lighter, and the oils from formations and\r\nregions where the alteration is approaching the carbonization limit are\r\ncharacteristically of the highest grade. This is the reverse of the\r\norder of products obtained by heat distillation. Whether there is also a\r\nnatural fractionation and improvement of the first heavy oils as they\r\nundergo repeated migrations is not known.\r\n\r\n=Inorganic theory of origin.= Another theory of the source of oil has\r\nhad some supporters, although they are much in the minority. This is the\r\nso-called \"inorganic\" theory, that oil comes from magmas and volcanic\r\nexhalations. In support of this theory attention is called to the fact\r\nthat igneous rocks and the gases associated with them frequently carry\r\ncarbides or hydrocarbons; that many oil fields have a suggestive\r\ngeographic relationship with volcanic rocks; and that certain of the oil\r\ndomes, as for instance in Mexico, are caused by plugs of igneous rocks\r\nfrom below. It has been suggested that deep within the earth carbon is\r\ncombined with iron in the form of an iron carbide, and that from the\r\niron carbide are generated the hydrocarbons of the oil, either by or\r\nwithout the agency of water. Iron carbide is magnetic, and significance\r\nhas been attached to the general correspondence between the locations of\r\noil in the western United States and regions of magnetic disturbance.\r\n\r\nIt seems not unlikely that some inorganic theory of this sort is\r\nnecessary to explain the ultimate source of oil or of the substances\r\nwhich become oil, but the evidence is overwhelming that organic agencies\r\nhave been mainly responsible for the principal oil pools now known.\r\n\r\n=Oil exploration.= A simple geographic basis for oil exploration is the\r\nfact that the major oil fields of the world are situated between 20 deg. and\r\n50 deg. north latitude, and that thus far there are no major oil areas\r\nwithin the tropics or within the southern hemisphere. This broad\r\ngeneralization may have little value when exploration is carried\r\nfurther. It has also been suggested that the geographic distribution of\r\noil corresponds roughly with the average annual temperatures, or\r\nisotherms, between 40 deg. and 70. deg.[25] It is thought that this present\r\ndistribution of temperatures may indicate roughly the temperatures of\r\nthe past when the oil was accumulated; and the inference is drawn that\r\nthere was some sort of limitation of areal deposition within these\r\ntemperature limits. If this be true, the only reasons why the southern\r\nhemisphere is not productive are the relatively small size of the land\r\nareas and the lack of exploration to date.\r\n\r\nIn approaching broadly the problem of oil exploration, the geologist\r\nconsiders in a general way the kinds and conditions of rocks which are\r\nlikely to be petroliferous or non-petroliferous. Schuchert[26]\r\nsummarizes these conditions for North America as follows:\r\n\r\n  1. The impossible areas for petroliferous rocks.\r\n\r\n     (_a_) The more extensive areas of igneous rocks and especially\r\n           those of the ancient shields; exception, the smaller dikes.\r\n\r\n     (_b_) All pre-Cambrian strata.\r\n\r\n     (_c_) All decidedly folded mountainous tracts older than the\r\n           Cretaceous; exceptions, domed and block-faulted\r\n           mountains.\r\n\r\n     (_d_) All regionally metamorphosed strata.\r\n\r\n     (_e_) Practically all continental or fresh-water deposits; relic\r\n           seas, so long as they are partly salty, and saline lakes are\r\n           excluded from this classification.\r\n\r\n     (_f_) Practically all marine formations that are thick and uniform\r\n           in rock character and that are devoid of interbedded dark\r\n           shales, thin-bedded dark impure limestones, dark marls, or\r\n           thin-bedded limy and fossiliferous sandstones.\r\n\r\n     (_g_) Practically all oceanic abyssal deposits; these, however, are\r\n           but rarely present on the continents.\r\n\r\n  2. Possible petroliferous areas.\r\n\r\n     (_a_) Highly folded marine and brackish water strata younger than\r\n           the Jurassic, but more especially those of Cenozoic time.\r\n\r\n     (_b_) Cambrian and Ordovician unfolded strata.\r\n\r\n     (_c_) Lake deposits formed under arid climates that cause the\r\n           waters to become saline; it appears that only in salty\r\n           waters (not over 4 per cent?) are the bituminous materials\r\n           made and preserved in the form of kerogen, the source of\r\n           petroleum; some of the Green River (Eocene) continental\r\n           deposits (the oil shales of Utah and Colorado) may be of\r\n           saline lakes.\r\n\r\n  3. Petroliferous areas.\r\n\r\n     (_a_) All marine and brackish water strata younger than the\r\n           Ordovician and but slightly warped, faulted, or folded; here\r\n           are included also the marine and brackish deposits of relic\r\n           seas like the Caspian, formed during the later Cenozoic. The\r\n           more certain oil-bearing strata are the porous thin-bedded\r\n           sandstones, limestones, and dolomites that are interbedded\r\n           with black, brown, blue, or green shales. Coal-bearing strata\r\n           of fresh-water origin are excluded. Series of strata with\r\n           disconformities may also be petroliferous, because beneath\r\n           former erosional surfaces the top strata have induced\r\n           porosity and therefore are possible reservoir rocks.\r\n\r\n     (_b_) All marine strata that are, roughly, within 100 miles of\r\n           former lands; here are more apt to occur the alternating\r\n           series of thin and thick-bedded sandstones and limestones\r\n           interbedded with shale zones.\r\n\r\nThe extent to which marine or brackish water conditions of sedimentation\r\nare requisite to the later formation of oil, as is suggested in the\r\nabove quotation, has long been a debatable question. It may be noted\r\nthat certain oil shales formed in fresh water basins contain abundant\r\norganic matter which is undoubtedly suitable for the generation of oil\r\nand gas, and that these shales on distillation yield oil essentially\r\nlike that obtained from oil shales of marine origin; that certain\r\nimportant oil-bearing sands of the younger Appalachian formations were\r\nlaid down in waters which are believed to have been only slightly\r\nsaline; that natural gas is present in fresh water basins; and that it\r\nhas not been demonstrated that salt in appreciable amounts is necessary\r\nfor the geologic, any more than for the artificial, distillation of oil.\r\nMost of the great oil fields have been in regions of marine or other\r\nsaline water deposits, but it has not been proved that this is a\r\nnecessary condition. White[27] says: \"At the present stage of our\r\nknowledge, fresh-water basins appearing otherwise to meet the\r\nrequirements should be wildcatted without prejudice.\"\r\n\r\nThe principal oil-bearing horizons in any locality are comparatively\r\nfew, and it is ordinarily easy to determine by stratigraphic methods the\r\npresence or absence of a favorable geologic horizon. By knowing the\r\nsuccession and thicknesses of the beds in a given region it is possible\r\nto infer from surface outcrops the approximate depth below the surface\r\nat which the desired horizon can be found. To do this, however, the\r\nconditions of sedimentation, the initial irregularities of the beds, the\r\nstructural conditions, including unconformities, and other factors must\r\nbe studied.\r\n\r\nIn exploration for oil the determination of the existence and location\r\nof the proper horizon is but an initial step. For instance, the oil of\r\nthe Midcontinent field of the United States is in the beds of the\r\nPennsylvanian, which are known to occupy an enormous area extending from\r\nIllinois and Wyoming south to the Gulf of Mexico. This information is\r\nclearly not sufficiently specific to limit the location of drill holes.\r\nSometimes seepages of oil or showings of gas near the surface are\r\nsufficient basis for localizing the drill holes.[28] Commonly, however,\r\nit is necessary to find some structural feature in the nature of a dome\r\nor anticline which suggests proper trapping conditions for an oil pool.\r\nThis is accomplished by geologic and topographic mapping of the surface.\r\nLevels and contours are run and outcrops are platted. As the outcrops\r\nare usually of different geologic horizons, it is necessary to select\r\nsome one or more identifiable beds as horizon markers, and to map their\r\nelevations at different points as a means of determining the structural\r\ncontours of the beds. When several key horizons are thus used, their\r\nelevations must be reduced to the elevations of one common horizon by\r\nthe addition or subtraction of the intervals between them. For instance,\r\nknowing the succession, an outcrop of a certain sandstone may indicate\r\nthat the marking horizon is 200 feet below, and the structural contour\r\nis then drawn accordingly. Observations of strike and dip at the surface\r\nare helpful; but where the beds are but slightly flexed, small\r\nirregularities in deposition may make strike and dip observations\r\nuseless in determining major structures. It is then necessary to have\r\nrecourse to the elevations of the marking horizons.\r\n\r\nIn the selection of key horizons, knowledge of the conditions of\r\nsedimentation is very important. For example, some of the oil fields\r\noccur in great delta deposits, where successive advances and retreats of\r\nthe sea have resulted in the interleaving of marine and land deposits.\r\nThe land-deposited sediments usually show great variations in character\r\nand thickness laterally and vertically; and a given bed is likely to\r\nthin out and disappear when traced for a short distance, rendering\r\nfutile its use as a marker. The marine sediments, on the either hand,\r\nshow a much greater degree of uniformity and continuity, and a bed of\r\nmarine limestone may extend over a large area and be very useful as a\r\nkey horizon.\r\n\r\nOver large areas outcrops and records of previously drilled water and\r\noil wells may not be sufficient to give an indication of structure; it\r\nthen becomes necessary to secure cross sections by drilling shallow\r\nholes to some identifiable bed, and to determine the structure from\r\nthese cross sections, in advance of deeper drilling through a favorable\r\nstructure thus located. The cooperative effort of the Illinois State\r\nSurvey and private interests, cited on page 306, is a good illustration\r\nof this procedure. This method is only in its infancy, because\r\nwell-drilling has not yet exhausted the possibilities of structures\r\nlocated from surface outcrops.\r\n\r\nThe so-called anticlinal structures, which have been found by experience\r\nto be so favorable to the accumulation of oil, are by no means\r\nsymmetrical in shape or uniform in size. They may be elongated arches\r\nwith equal dip on the two sides, or one side may dip and the other be\r\nnearly flat. In a territory with a general dip in one direction, a\r\nslight change in the angle, though not in the direction of dip,\r\nsometimes called an arrested dip, may cause sufficient irregularity to\r\nproduce the necessary trapping conditions. In other cases the anticline\r\nmay be of nearly equidimensional dome form. The largest anticlines which\r\nhave been found to act as specific reservoirs are rarely more than a few\r\nmiles in extent, and in many cases only a mile or two. The \"closure\" of\r\nan anticline is the difference between the height of a given stratum at\r\nthe highest point and at the edges of the structure. A considerable\r\nnumber of productive anticlines are known in which the beds dip so\r\ngently as to give a closure of 20 feet or less.\r\n\r\nAfter the structural outlines of beds near the surface have been\r\ndetermined, all possible information should be used in projecting these\r\nstructures downward to the oil-producing horizons. Where a number of\r\nwells have been previously drilled in the vicinity, examination of their\r\nrecords may indicate certain lateral variations in the thickness of the\r\nbeds between the horizon which has been mapped and the producing\r\nhorizon. The effect of such lateral variations may be either to\r\naccentuate the surface structure, or to cause it to disappear entirely\r\nand thus to indicate lack of favorable trapping conditions. The\r\npossibility of several oil-producing beds, at different depths--a not\r\nuncommon condition in many fields--should also be kept in mind.\r\n\r\nAs already indicated, anticlines are not always essential to make the\r\nnecessary trapping conditions. In the Beaumont field of Texas, for\r\ninstance, it has been shown that irregular primary deposition of\r\nsediments differing in porosity both vertically and horizontally allowed\r\nthe oil to migrate upward irregularly along the porous beds and parts\r\nof beds, and to be trapped between the more impervious portions of the\r\nbeds.\r\n\r\nFurther questions to be considered in the exploration of an area are the\r\ncontent of organic matter in the sediments which may have served as a\r\nsource of oil, the presence of impervious cap-rocks or of variations in\r\nporosity sufficient to retain the oil, the thickness of sediments and\r\nthe extent to which they have undergone differential stresses, the\r\namount of erosion and the possibilities that oil, if formed, has escaped\r\nfrom the eroded edges of porous strata, and, where carbonaceous beds are\r\npresent, their degree of carbonization, and many other similar matters.\r\n\r\nEach field in fact has its own \"habit,\" determined by the interaction of\r\nseveral geologic factors. This habit may be learned empirically.\r\nGeologists have often gone wrong in applying to a new district certain\r\nprinciples determined elsewhere, without sufficient consideration of the\r\ncomplexity and relative importance of the sundry geologic factors which\r\nin the aggregate determine the local habit of oil occurrence.\r\n\r\nGeographically associated fields characterized by similarity of oil\r\noccurrence, age, and origin, are known as _petroliferous provinces_. The\r\nfactors entering into the classification of fields are so numerous that\r\nmore precise definition of a petroliferous province is hardly yet agreed\r\nupon.\r\n\r\nThe part played by the economic geologist in oil exploration and\r\ndevelopment is a large one for the obvious reasons given above. Probably\r\nno other single division of economic geology now employs so large a\r\nnumber of geologists. Practically no large oil company, or large piece\r\nof oil exploration and development, is now handled without geologic\r\nadvice. Quoting from Arnold:[29]\r\n\r\n     It ought to be as obvious that exploration with the drill\r\n     should be preceded by careful geologic studies as it is that\r\n     railroad construction should be based on surveys. These\r\n     studies should include such subjects as topography,\r\n     stratigraphy, structure, and surface evidence of petroleum in\r\n     the regions to be tested. The work divides itself into two\r\n     stages--preliminary reconnaissances and detailed surveys.\r\n\r\n     The preliminary reconnaissance should consist in procuring all\r\n     the available published and hearsay evidence regarding the\r\n     occurrence of oil or gas seepages or hydrocarbon deposits in\r\n     the region; in making preliminary geologic surveys to\r\n     determine from which formations the oil is to come and the\r\n     areal distribution of these formations; in determining those\r\n     general regions in which the surface evidence is supposed to\r\n     be most favorable for the accumulation of hydrocarbons; and in\r\n     determining the best routes and methods of transportation.\r\n\r\n     The second stage includes detailed geologic surveys of those\r\n     regions where the surface evidence indicates that petroleum is\r\n     most likely to be found and the location of test holes at\r\n     favorable points. By working out the surface distribution and\r\n     structure of the formations it is usually possible to select\r\n     the areas offering the best chances of success. Geology should\r\n     always be the dominant factor in determining the location of\r\n     test holes, although modifications to meet natural conditions\r\n     must sometimes be made.\r\n\r\n\r\nOIL SHALES\r\n\r\nOne of the sources of oil which is likely to become important in the\r\nfuture is oil shales,--that is, shales from which oil product can be\r\nextracted by distillation. These have already been referred to on\r\nprevious pages. Such shales are now mined only in Scotland and in France\r\nto a relatively small extent, but there are immense reserves of these\r\nshales in various parts of the world which are likely to be drawn upon\r\nwhen commercial conditions require it. In the United States alone it is\r\nestimated that the oil shales are a potential source of oil in amounts\r\nfar greater than all the natural petroleum of this hemisphere.[30] The\r\nsolution of the problem of extraction of oil from shales is fairly well\r\nadvanced technically, and the problem has now become principally one of\r\ncost. In order to recover any large amount of oil from this source,\r\noperations of stupendous magnitude, approximately on the scale of the\r\ncoal industry, must be established. As long as there are sufficient\r\nsupplies of oil concentrated by nature to be drawn upon, it is unlikely\r\nthat oil shale will furnish any considerable percentage of the world's\r\noil requirements. With the great increase in world demand for oil,\r\nhowever, which may very possibly outstrip the available annual supply in\r\nthe future, and particularly with the increase in the United States\r\ndemand relative to domestic supplies, exhaustive surveys of the\r\nsituation are being made with a view to development of oil shales when\r\nwarranted by market conditions.\r\n\r\nOil shales are sedimentary strata containing decomposed products of\r\nplants and animals. Locally they grade into cannel coal, with which they\r\nare genetically related. They may be regarded as representing the kinds\r\nof sediments from which the oil of oil pools has in the main originated.\r\n\r\nThe most extensive of the oil shales of the United States are found in\r\nthe Eocene beds of northwestern Colorado, northeastern Utah, and\r\nsouthwestern Wyoming, and in the Miocene beds of northern Nevada. The\r\nlargest known foreign deposits occur in Brazil and Russia.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURAL GAS\r\n\r\n\r\nECONOMIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nNatural gas is used both for lighting and for fuel purposes. In the\r\nUnited States it has become the basis of a great industry, the value of\r\nthe product ranging above that of lead and zinc. The United States is\r\nthe largest producer of natural gas. Other producers are Canada, Dutch\r\nEast Indies, Mexico, Hungary, Japan, and Italy. Nearly all producing oil\r\nfields furnish also some natural gas.\r\n\r\nIn the United States nearly 40 per cent of the total production of\r\nnatural gas comes from West Virginia, about 17 per cent from\r\nPennsylvania, about 17 per cent from Oklahoma, and less than 10 per cent\r\nfrom each of Ohio, California, Louisiana, Kansas, Texas, and several\r\nother states.\r\n\r\nOne of the recent interesting developments in this industry is the\r\nrecovery of gasoline from the natural gas. This is obtained by\r\ncompression and condensation of the casing-head gas from oil wells, and\r\nalso, more recently, by an absorption process which is applied not only\r\nto \"wet\" gas from oil wells but also to so-called \"dry\" gas occurring\r\nindependently of oil. It is a high-grade product which in recent years\r\nhas amounted to about 10 per cent of the total output of gasoline for\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nNatural gas, like oil, originates in the distillation of organic\r\nsubstances in sediments, and migrates to reservoirs capped by impervious\r\nstrata. It is commonly, though not always, associated with oil and coal.\r\nThe geologic features of its occurrence have so much in common with oil\r\nthat a description would essentially duplicate the above account of the\r\ngeologic features of oil.\r\n\r\n\r\nASPHALT AND BITUMEN\r\n\r\n\r\nECONOMIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nAsphalt and bitumen are not used as energy resources, but they have so\r\nmuch in common with oil in occurrence and origin that they are included\r\nin this chapter.\r\n\r\nAsphalt and bitumen find their main use in paving. Other important uses\r\nare in paints and varnishes, in the manufacture of prepared roofing, for\r\nvarious insulating purposes, and in substitutes for rubber.\r\n\r\nNearly the entire world's supply of natural asphalt comes from the\r\nBritish Island of Trinidad and from Venezuela. Both of these deposits\r\nare under United States commercial control probably affiliated with\r\nDutch-English interests. Prior to the war about half the product went to\r\nEurope and half to the United States. Large amounts of asphaltic and\r\nbituminous rock, used mainly in paving, are normally produced in Alsace,\r\nFrance, and in Italy. Prior to the war both the Alsatian and Italian\r\ndeposits were under German commercial control. Their output is\r\npractically all consumed in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe United States takes a large part in the world's trade in natural\r\nasphalt, by importation from Trinidad and Venezuela, and by some\r\nreexportation chiefly to Canada and Mexico. The United States also\r\nproduces some natural asphalt and bituminous rock for domestic\r\nconsumption. Deposits of natural asphaltic material are widely\r\ndistributed through the United States, but commercial production is\r\nlimited to a few localities in Kentucky, Texas, Utah, Colorado,\r\nOklahoma, and California.\r\n\r\nThe asphalt manufactured from petroleum constitutes a much larger\r\ntonnage than natural asphalt though it does not enter so largely into\r\nworld trade. The manufactured product is largely but not exclusively in\r\nAmerican control. Large amounts are made in this country and will no\r\ndoubt be made for the next decade, from oil produced in the southwestern\r\nstates and in Mexico. At the present time as much or more asphalt is\r\nmade in the United States from Mexican as from domestic crude oil. The\r\nrefineries are located near the Gulf coast so that exports can avoid\r\noverland shipments. The relative merits of natural asphalt and asphalt\r\nmanufactured from oil may be subject to some discussion; but it is\r\nperfectly clear that the manufactured material is sufficient, both in\r\nquantity and variety, to make the United States entirely independent and\r\nhave an exportable surplus.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nNatural asphalt and similar products are in the main merely the\r\nresiduals of oil and gas distillation accumulated by nature under\r\ncertain conditions already described in connection with oil (pp.\r\n140-144). In some cases the asphaltic material is found as impregnations\r\nof sediments, and appears to have remained in place while the lighter\r\norganic materials were volatilized and migrated upward. In other cases\r\nit occurs in distinct fissure veins; the fissures and cavities\r\napparently were once filled with liquid petroleum, which has\r\nsubsequently undergone further distillation. The original liquid\r\ncharacter of some of these bitumens is shown by occasional fragments of\r\nunworn \"country rock\" imbedded in the veins. The effect of surface\r\nwaters, carrying oxidizing materials and sulphuric acid, is believed to\r\nhave contributed to the drying out and hardening of these veins or\r\ndikes.\r\n\r\nAsphalts and bitumens include a wide variety of hydrocarbon materials,\r\nsuch as gilsonite, grahamite, elaterite, ozokerite, etc., which are used\r\nfor somewhat different purposes. The deposits of the United States show\r\nmuch variety in form, composition, age, and geologic associations. The\r\nimportant Kentucky deposits occur as impregnations of Carboniferous\r\nsandstones at the base of the Coal Measures of that state.\r\n\r\nThe Trinidad asphalt comes from the famous \"pitch lake,\" which is a\r\nnearly circular deposit covering about a hundred acres 150 feet above\r\nsea level, and which is believed to fill the crater of an old mud\r\nvolcano. The so-called pitch consists of a mixture of bitumen, water,\r\nmineral and vegetable matter, the whole inflated with gas, which escapes\r\nto some extent and keeps the mass in a state of constant ebullition. The\r\nsurface of the lake is hard, and yet the mass as a whole is plastic and\r\ntends to refill the excavations. The lake is believed to be on the\r\noutcrop of a petroleum-bearing stratum, and the pitch to represent the\r\nunevaporated residue of millions of tons of petroleum which have exuded\r\nfrom the oil-sands. The pitch is refined by melting,--the heat expelling\r\nthe water, the wood and other light impurities rising, and the heavy\r\nmineral matter sinking to the bottom.\r\n\r\nThe asphalt of Venezuela is similar in nature, but the pitch \"lake\" is\r\nhere covered with vegetation and the soft pitch wells up at certain\r\npoints as if from subterranean springs.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[17] For more detailed treatment of international coal movements before\r\nthe war and of coal movements within the United States, see the U.

In other regions similar surface indications may mean that the\r\nstratum in the outcrop of which they are found is oil-bearing; but\r\naccumulations of oil, if present, may be several miles down the dip, at\r\nplaces where the structural conditions have been favorable. In still\r\nother cases the seepage may have been in existence for such a long time\r\nas to exhaust the reservoir. It must also be remembered that gas seeps\r\nare common in sloughs and marshes where vegetation is decaying, and may\r\nbe of no significance in the search for petroleum.\r\n\r\n[29] Arnold, Ralph, Conservation of the oil and gas resources of the\r\nAmericas: _Econ.

The raw materials necessary for their manufacture include a wide\r\nvariety of minerals.\r\n\r\nIron is the principal element in this group; but in the manufacture of\r\niron and steel, manganese, chromium, nickel, tungsten, molybdenum,\r\nvanadium, zirconium, titanium, aluminum, uranium, magnesium, fluorine,\r\nsilicon, and other substances play important parts, either as\r\naccessories in the furnace reactions or as ingredients introduced to\r\ngive certain qualities to the products.\r\n\r\nNearly all parts of the world are plentifully supplied with iron ores\r\nfor an indefinite period in the future, but their abundant use has thus\r\nfar been confined mainly to the countries bordering the North\r\nAtlantic,--the United States, Germany, and England,--which, possessing\r\nample coal supplies, have had the initiative to develop great iron and\r\nsteel industries. China has abundant coal, moderate quantities of iron\r\nore, and a large population, but a low per capita consumption of iron\r\nand steel products. Development of its iron and steel industry is just\r\nbeginning. Japan has neither coal nor iron in sufficient quantities, and\r\nhence the Japanese effort in recent years to control the mineral\r\nresources of China and other countries. As a result of the war Germany\r\nhas been largely deprived of its iron ores, and France may assume\r\nsomewhat the rank in iron ore production once held by Germany. Sweden\r\nand Spain have been considerable producers of iron ore, but both lack\r\ncoal, with the result that their ores have been largely exported to\r\nEngland and Germany. With increase of per capita consumption in outlying\r\nparts of the world, iron and steel industries are beginning to develop\r\nlocally on a small scale, as in India, South Africa, and Australia.\r\nRussia has had sufficient supplies of coal and iron, but the stage of\r\nindustrial development in that country has not called for great\r\nexpansion of its iron and steel industry.\r\n\r\nThere has been a tendency for iron and steel manufacture to become\r\nconcentrated at a comparatively few places on the globe favored by the\r\nproper combinations of coal, iron, transportation, proximity to\r\nconsuming populations, initiative and capacity to take advantage of a\r\nsituation, and other factors. Even though on paper conditions may seem\r\nto be favorable in outlying territories for the development of\r\nadditional plants, this development is often held back by competition\r\nfrom the established centers. On the west coast of the United States,\r\nthere are raw materials for an iron and steel industry and there has\r\nbeen discussion for years as to the possibilities of starting a\r\nsuccessful large scale steel industry. The consuming power of the local\r\npopulation for all kinds of iron and steel would seem to be great enough\r\nto warrant such action. However, the demand is for an extremely varied\r\nassortment of iron and steel products; and to start an industry, making\r\nonly a few of the cruder products such as pig iron and semi-finished\r\nforms, would not meet this demand. All varieties of finishing plants and\r\nassociated factories would also need to be started in order to meet the\r\nsituation. This would require large capital. Furthermore the local\r\ndemand for some of the accessory finished products might not warrant the\r\nestablishment of the accessory plants.\r\n\r\nThroughout the history of the iron and steel business there has been a\r\nmarked tendency for the iron ore to move to regions of coal production\r\nrather than for the coal to move to the iron ore regions. The coal or\r\nenergy factor seems ultimately to control. This is due in considerable\r\npart to the fact that coal furnishes the basis of a great variety of\r\nindustries for which iron ore is only one of the feeders, and which are\r\nso interrelated that it is not always easy to move the iron and steel\r\nindustry to a spot near the sources of iron ore where iron and steel\r\nalone could be produced.\r\n\r\nIn regard to iron ore supplies of proper grade and quantity, the United\r\nStates is more nearly self-sufficing than any of its competitors. It\r\nimports minor amounts of ore from Cuba and Canada, and even from Chile\r\nand Sweden, to border points, in the main merely because these imported\r\nores can compete on a price basis with the domestic ores. The entire\r\nexclusion of these ores, however, would make comparatively little\r\ndifference in the total volume of our iron and steel industry; though it\r\nwould probably make some difference in distribution, to the disadvantage\r\nof plants along the coast. There is only one kind of iron ore in which\r\nthe United States has anything approaching deficiency, and that is ore\r\nextremely low in phosphorus, adapted to making the so-called\r\nlow-phosphorus pig which is needed for certain special steels. Ordnance\r\nrequirements during the war put a premium on these steels. While some of\r\nthese extremely low-phosphorus ores are mined in the United States,\r\nadditional quantities have been required from Spain and Canada and to a\r\nlesser extent from North Africa and Sweden. Also the Spanish pyrite,\r\nimported ordinarily for its sulphur content, on roasting leaves a\r\nresidue of iron oxide extremely low in phosphorus which is similarly\r\nused. The elimination of pyrite imports from Spain during the war,\r\ntherefore, was a considerable contributing factor to the stringency in\r\nlow-phosphorus iron ores. War experience showed that the United States\r\nwas dependent on foreign sources for 40 per cent or upwards of its needs\r\nin this regard. Certain developments in progress, notably the project\r\nfor concentration of siliceous eastern Mesabi Range ores, make it likely\r\nthat future domestic production will more nearly be able to meet the\r\nrequirements.\r\n\r\nThe equivalent of 15 per cent of the iron ore mined in the United States\r\nis exported as ore to Canadian ports on the Great Lakes and in the form\r\nof crude iron and steel products to many parts of the world. England and\r\nGermany are almost the sole competitors in the export trade.\r\n\r\nWhen we turn to the minerals used for making the alloys of iron and as\r\naccessories in the manufacture of iron, it appears that no one of the\r\nprincipal iron and steel producing countries of the world is\r\nself-supporting, but that these \"sweeteners\" must be drawn in from the\r\nfar corners of the earth. The importance of these minor constituents is\r\naltogether out of proportion to their volume. For instance, only\r\nfourteen pounds of manganese are necessary in the making of a ton of\r\nsteel, yet a ton of steel cannot be made without manganese. The\r\nincreasing specialization in iron and steel products, and the rapidly\r\nwidening knowledge of the qualities of the different alloys, are\r\nconstantly shifting the demand from one to the other of the ferro-alloy\r\nminerals. Each one of the ferro-alloy minerals may be regarded as being\r\nin the nature of a key mineral for the iron and steel industry, and the\r\ncontrol of deposits of these minerals is a matter of international\r\nconcern. Control is not a difficult matter, in view of the fact that the\r\nprincipal supplies of practically every one of the alloy minerals are\r\nconcentrated in comparatively few spots on the globe,--as indicated on\r\nsucceeding pages.\r\n\r\nNature has not endowed the United States, nor in fact the North American\r\ncontinent, with adequate high-grade supplies of the principal\r\nferro-alloy minerals,--with the exception of molybdenum, and with the\r\nexception of silica, magnesite, and fluorspar, which are used as\r\naccessories in the process of steel making. With plenty of iron ore and\r\ncoal, and with an iron and steel capacity amounting to over 50 per cent\r\nof the world's total, the United States is very largely dependent on\r\nother countries for its supplies of the ferro-alloy minerals. The war\r\nbrought this fact home. With the closing of foreign sources of supplies,\r\nit looked at one time as if our steel industry was to be very greatly\r\nhampered; and extraordinary efforts were made to keep channels of\r\nimportation open until something could be done in the way of\r\ndevelopment, even at excessive cost, of domestic supplies. The result of\r\nwar efforts was a very large development of domestic supplies of\r\npractically all the ferro-alloy minerals; but in no case, with the\r\nexceptions noted above, did these prove sufficient to meet the total\r\nrequirements. This development was at great cost and at some sacrifice\r\nto metallurgical efficiency, due to the low and variable grades of the\r\nraw materials. With the post-war reopening of importation much of the\r\ndomestic production has necessarily ceased, and large amounts of money\r\npatriotically spent in the effort to meet the domestic requirements have\r\nbeen lost. These circumstances have resulted in the demand in Congress\r\nfrom producers for direct financial relief and in demand for protective\r\ntariffs, in order to enable the new struggling industries to exist, and\r\nto permit of development of adequate home supplies. Such tariffs might\r\nbe beneficial to these particular domestic industries if wisely planned;\r\nbut also, in view of the limited amounts of these particular ores in\r\nthis country, their general low grade, and the high cost of mining,\r\ntariffs might very probably hasten exhaustion of our limited supplies\r\nand might handicap our metallurgical industries both in efficiency and\r\ncost (see pp. 365-366, 393-394).\r\n\r\n\r\nIRON ORES\r\n\r\n\r\nECONOMIC FEATURES\r\n\r\n=Technical and commercial factors determining use of iron ore minerals.=\r\nPopularly, an iron ore is an iron ore, and there is little realization\r\nof its really great complexity of composition and the difficulty of\r\ndetermining what is or is not a commercial ore. Percentage of iron is of\r\ncourse an important factor; but an ore in which the iron is in the\r\nmineral hematite is more valuable than one with an equivalent percentage\r\nof iron which is in the form of magnetite. Substances present in the ore\r\nin minor quantities, such as phosphorus, sulphur, and titanium, have a\r\ntendency to make the iron product brittle, either when it is cold or\r\nwhen it is being made, so that excessive amounts of these substances may\r\ndisqualify an ore. Excessive quantities of silica, lime, or magnesia may\r\nmake the ore undesirable. Where an acid substance, like silica, is\r\nbalanced by basic constituents like lime and magnesia, considerable\r\namounts of both may be used. Excessive moisture content may spoil an ore\r\nbecause of the amount of heat necessary to eliminate it in smelting.\r\n\r\nThe metallurgical processes of the iron and steel industry are\r\nessentially adapted to the principal grades of ore available. The\r\ncheapest of the steel-making processes, called the acid Bessemer\r\nprocess, requires a very low-phosphorus ore (usually below .050 per cent\r\nin the United States and below .030 per cent in England.) The basic\r\nopen-hearth processes, making two-thirds of the steel in the United\r\nStates, allow higher percentages of phosphorus, but not unlimited\r\namounts. The basic Bessemer (Thomas) process, used for the \"minette\"\r\nores of western Europe and the Swedish magnetites, may use an ore with\r\nany amount of phosphorus over 1.5 per cent. The phosphatic slag from\r\nthis process is used as fertilizer. The supply of low-phosphorus\r\nBessemer ore in the United States is at present limited as compared with\r\nthat of the non-Bessemer ores, with the result that steel-plant\r\nconstruction for many years past has been largely open-hearth. The\r\nopen-hearth process is favored also because it allows closer control of\r\nphosphorus content in the steel.\r\n\r\nSmall but increasing amounts of steel are also made in the electric\r\nfurnace; for the most part, however, this process is more expensive than\r\nthe others, and it is used principally for special alloy steels.\r\n\r\nIron ores are seldom so uniform in quality that they can be shipped\r\nwithout careful attention to sampling and grade. In the Lake Superior\r\nregion the ores are sampled daily as mined, and the utmost care is taken\r\nto mix and load the ore in such a way that the desired grades can be\r\nobtained. Ordinarily a single deposit produces several grades of ore.\r\nWhen ores are put into the furnace for smelting the mixtures are\r\nselected with great care for the particular purpose for which the\r\nproduct is to be used. The mixture is compounded as carefully as a\r\ndruggist's prescription. An ore salesman, after ascertaining the nature\r\nof the iron and steel products of a plant, has to use great skill in\r\noffering particular ores for sale which not only will meet the desired\r\ngrade in regard to all elements, but also will meet competition in\r\nprice. In some respects, the marketing of different grades of iron ore\r\nis as complex as the marketing of a miscellaneous stock of merchandise.\r\nWith ores, as with merchandise, custom and sentiment play their\r\npart,--with the result that two ores of identical grade mineralogically\r\nand chemically may have quite a different vogue and price, simply\r\nbecause of the fact that furnace men are used to one and not to the\r\nother and are not willing to experiment.\r\n\r\nThe geologist is ordinarily concerned merely with finding an ore of as\r\ngood a general grade as possible; but he often finds to his surprise\r\nthat his efforts have been directed toward the discovery of something\r\nwhich, due to some minor defect in texture, in mineralogical\r\ncomposition, or in chemical composition, is difficult to introduce on\r\nthe market. There is here a promising field, intermediate between\r\ngeology (or mineralogy) and metallurgy, for the application of\r\nprinciples of chemistry, metallurgy, and mineralogy, which is occupied\r\nat the present time mainly by the ore salesman. Both the mineralogist\r\nand metallurgist touch the problem but they do not cover it. With\r\nincreasingly precise and rapidly changing metallurgical requirements,\r\nthis field calls for scientific development.\r\n\r\n=Geographic distribution of iron ore production.= Iron ores are widely\r\ndistributed over the world, but are produced and smelted on a large\r\nscale only in a few places where there is a fortunate conjunction of\r\nhigh grades, large quantity, proximity of coal, cheap transportation to\r\nmarkets, and manufacturing enterprise. Over 90 per cent of the iron ore\r\nproduction of the world is in countries bordering the North Atlantic\r\nbasin. The United States produces about 40 per cent, France about 12 per\r\ncent, England about 10 per cent, Germany before the war 15 to 20 per\r\ncent, and Spain, Russia, and Sweden each about 5 per cent. Lesser\r\nproducing countries are Luxemburg, Austria-Hungary, Cuba, Newfoundland,\r\nand Algeria; and insignificant amounts are produced in many other parts\r\nof the world. Of the world's iron and steel manufacturing capacity, the\r\nUnited States has about 53 per cent, Germany 16 per cent, England 14 per\r\ncent, France 10 per cent, the remainder of Europe (chiefly Russia,\r\nAustria-Hungary, and Belgium) 7 per cent. The absence of important iron\r\nore production and of iron and steel manufacture either in the southern\r\nhemisphere or in any of the countries bordering the Pacific is a\r\nsignificant feature, when we remember what part iron plays in modern\r\ncivilization. Japan, however, is beginning to develop a considerable\r\niron and steel industry, which promises to use a large amount of ore\r\nfrom China, Manchuria, and Korea, and possibly to compete in American\r\nPacific Coast markets.\r\n\r\nIn the United States about 85 per cent of the production, or one-third\r\nof the world's production, comes from the Lake Superior region, a large\r\npart of the remainder from the Birmingham district, Alabama, and smaller\r\nquantities from the Adirondacks. For the rest of the North American\r\ncontinent, the only largely producing deposit is that at Belle Isle,\r\nNewfoundland, which is the basis of the iron industry of eastern Canada.\r\nCuba supplies some ore to the east coast of the United States.\r\n\r\nIn Europe there are only three large sources of high-grade iron ore\r\nwhich have heretofore been drawn on largely,--the magnetite deposits of\r\nnorthern Sweden, the hematites and siderites of the Bilbao and adjacent\r\ndistricts of northern Spain, and the magnetite-hematite deposits of\r\nsouthern Russia. The first two of these ores have been used to raise the\r\npercentage of iron in the low-grade ores which are the principal\r\nreliance of western Europe. The Swedish ores have also been necessary\r\nin order to raise the percentage of phosphorus and thus make the ores\r\nsuitable for the Thomas process; on the other hand the Spanish ores and\r\na small part of the Swedish material have been desired because of their\r\nlow phosphorus content, adapted to the acid Bessemer process and to the\r\nmanufacture of low-phosphorus pig. The Russian ores have largely been\r\nsmelted in that country.\r\n\r\nThe largest of the western European low-grade deposits is a geographic\r\nand geologic unit spreading over parts of Lorraine, Luxemburg, and the\r\nimmediately adjacent Briey, Longwy, and Nancy districts of France. The\r\nores of this region are called \"minette\" ores. This unit produces about\r\na fourth of the world's iron ore. Low-grade deposits of a somewhat\r\nsimilar nature in the Cleveland, Lincolnshire, and adjacent districts of\r\nEngland form the main basis for the British industry. There is minor\r\nproduction of iron ores in other parts of France and Germany, in\r\nAustria-Hungary, and in North Africa (these last being important because\r\nof their low phosphorus content).\r\n\r\nComparison of figures of consumption and production of iron ores\r\nindicates that the United States, France, Russia, and Austria-Hungary\r\nare self-supporting so far as quantity of materials is concerned.\r\nCertain ores of special grades, and ores of other minerals of the\r\nferro-alloy group required in steel making, however, must be imported\r\nfrom foreign sources; this matter has been discussed above. Great\r\nBritain and Germany appear to be dependent on foreign sources, even\r\nunder pre-war conditions, for part of the material for their furnaces.\r\nDuring the war there was considerable development of the low-grade\r\nEnglish ores, but this does not eliminate the necessity for importing\r\nhigh-grade ores for mixture. Belgium produces a very small percentage of\r\nher ore requirements and is practically dependent on the\r\nLorraine-Luxemburg field.\r\n\r\nThe principal effect of the war on iron ore production was the\r\noccupation of the great French mining and smelting field by the Germans,\r\nthereby depriving the French of their largest source of iron ore. Since\r\nthe war the situation has been reversed, France now possessing the\r\nLorraine field, which formerly supplied Germany with 70 per cent of its\r\niron ore. As the German industrial life is largely based on iron and\r\nsteel manufacture, the problem of ore supplies for Germany is now a\r\ncritical one. It has led to German activity in Chile and may lead to\r\nGerman developments in eastern Europe and western Asia, particularly in\r\nthe large and favorably located reserves of southern Russia. It seems\r\nlikely, however, that arrangements will also be made to continue the\r\nexport of ore from the Lorraine field down the Rhine to the principal\r\nGerman smelting centers. France needs the German coal for coking as\r\nbadly as Germany needs the French iron ore. The Rhine valley is the\r\nconnecting channel for a balanced movement of commodities determined by\r\nthe natural conditions. These basic conditions are likely in the long\r\nrun to override political considerations.\r\n\r\nThe Lake Superior deposits, the Swedish magnetites, the Spanish\r\nhematites, and the Russian ores carry 50 to 65 per cent of metallic\r\niron. The Birmingham deposits of southeastern United States, the main\r\nBritish supplies, and the main French and German supplies contain about\r\n35 per cent or less. It is only where ores are fortunately located with\r\nreference to consuming centers that the low-grade deposits can be used.\r\nFor outlying territories only the higher-grade deposits are likely to be\r\ndeveloped, and even there many high-grade deposits are known which are\r\nnot mined. The largest single group not yet drawn on is in Brazil.\r\nOthers in a very early stage of development are in North Africa and\r\nChile.\r\n\r\n=World reserves and future production of iron ore.= The average rate of\r\nconsumption of iron ore for the world in recent years has been about 170\r\nmillion tons per year. At this rate the proved ore reserves would last\r\nabout 180 years. If it be assumed that consumption in the future will\r\nincrease at about the same rate as it has in the past, the total\r\nmeasured reserve would still last about a century. These calculations of\r\nlife, however, are based only on the known reserves; and when potential\r\nreserves are included the life is greatly increased. And this is not\r\nall; for beyond the total reported reserves (both actual and potential),\r\nthere are known additional large quantities of lower-grade ores, at\r\npresent not commercially available, but which will be available in the\r\nfuture,--to say nothing of expected future discoveries of ores of all\r\ngrades in unexplored territories. Both geological inference and the\r\nhistory of iron ore exploration seem to make such future discoveries\r\npractically certain. Iron ore constitutes about 4 per cent of the\r\nearth's shell and it shows all stages of concentration up to 70 per\r\ncent. Only those rocks are called \"iron ores\" which have a sufficiently\r\nhigh percentage of iron to be adapted to present processes for the\r\nextraction of iron. When economic conditions demand it, it may be\r\nassumed that iron-bearing rocks not now ordinarily regarded as ores may\r\nbe used to commercial advantage, and therefore will become ores.\r\n\r\nNot only is an indefinitely long life assured for iron ore reserves as a\r\nwhole, but the same is true of many of the principal groups of deposits.\r\n\r\nThe question of practical concern to us, therefore, is not one of total\r\niron ore reserves, but one of degrees of _availability_ of different\r\nores to the markets which focus our requirements for iron.\r\n\r\nThe annual production of ore from a given district is roughly a measure\r\nof that ore's ability to meet the competitive market, and therefore, of\r\nits actual immediate or past availability. Annual production is the net\r\nresult of the interaction of all of the factors bearing on availability.\r\nIt may be argued that there are ores known and not yet mined which are\r\nalso immediately available. On the whole, they seem to be less available\r\nthan ores actually being produced; otherwise general economic pressure\r\nwould require their use and actual production.\r\n\r\nIn considering the future availability of iron ores, it is obvious that\r\ntables of past production afford only a partial basis for prediction.\r\nPresumably districts which have produced largely in the past may be\r\nexpected to continue as important factors. In these cases production has\r\ndemonstrated availability. Continued heavy production may thus be\r\nexpected from the ores of the Lake Superior region, from the Clinton\r\nhematites of Alabama, from the ores of the Lorraine-Luxemburg-Briey\r\ndistrict, from the Cleveland ores of England, from the Bilbao ores of\r\nSpain, from the high-grade magnetites of northern Sweden, and (assuming\r\npolitical stability) from the ores of southern Russia.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, also, recent increases in production from certain districts\r\nare probably significant of increased use of such ores in the future.\r\nAmong these developments are the increasing production of Swedish ores\r\nand their importation into England and Germany, and the increasing use\r\nof Clinton hematites and Adirondack magnetites in the United States.\r\nLow-grade ores from the great reserves of Cuba are being mined and\r\nbrought to the east coast of the United States in increasing amounts,\r\nand it is highly probable that they will take a larger share of the\r\nmarket. A similar project in Chile, which lay dormant during the war\r\nbecause of restricted shipping facilities, is expected in the near\r\nfuture to yield important shipments to the United States. In none of\r\nthese cases will production be limited in the near future by ore\r\nreserves. Increased production and use of iron ores are also to be\r\nlooked for in Newfoundland, North Africa, China, India, Australia, and\r\nSouth Africa.\r\n\r\nOn the commercial horizon are ores of still newer districts, the\r\navailability of which may not be read from tables of production. Their\r\navailability must be determined by analysis and measurement of the\r\nfactors entering into availability. Availability of iron ore is\r\ndetermined by percentage of iron, percentages of impurities, percentages\r\nof advantageous or deleterious minor constituents, physical texture,\r\nconditions for profitable mining, adaptability to present furnace\r\npractice, distance from consuming centers, conditions and costs of\r\ntransportation, geographical and transportational relation to the coal\r\nand fluxes necessary for smelting, trade relations, tariffs and taxes,\r\ninertia of invested capital, and other considerations. All of these\r\nfactors are variable. A comparison of ores on the basis of any one of\r\nthese factors or of any two or three of them is likely to be misleading.\r\nA comparison based on the quantitative consideration of all of the\r\nseveral factors seems to be made practically impossible by the\r\ndifficulty of ascertaining accurately the quantitative range and\r\nimportance of each factor, and by the difficulty of integrating all of\r\nthe factors even if they should be determined. However, their combined\r\neffect is expressed in the cost of bringing the product to market; and\r\ncomparison of costs furnishes a means of comparing availability of ores.\r\nA high-grade ore, cheaply mined and favorably located with reference to\r\nthe points of demand, will command a relatively high price at the point\r\nof production. The same ore so located that its transportation costs are\r\nhigher will command a lower price; or it may be so located that the\r\ncosts of mining and bringing it to places where it can be used are so\r\nhigh that there is no profit in the operation. There are known\r\nhigh-grade iron ores which, because of cost, are not available under\r\npresent conditions.\r\n\r\nThe availability of an ore, then, depends on its relation to a\r\nmarket,--whether, after meeting the cost of transportation, it can be\r\nsold at prevailing market prices at the consuming centers, and can still\r\nleave a fair margin of profit for the mining operation. The price\r\nequilibrium between consuming centers affords a reasonably uniform basis\r\nagainst which to measure availability of ores.\r\n\r\nFigures of cost are obtainable as a basis for comparison of availability\r\nof iron ores of certain of the districts, but not enough are at hand for\r\ncomparison of the ores of all districts. Careful study of costs has\r\ndemonstrated the availability in the near future of the Brazilian\r\nhigh-grade Bessemer hematites; and projects which are now under way for\r\nexportation to England and the United States will doubtless make this\r\nenormous reserve play an important part in the iron industry. Iron ore\r\nis known but not yet mined in many parts of the western United States\r\nand western Canada. With the increasing population along the west coast\r\nof North America, projects for smelting the ore there are becoming more\r\ndefinite. Establishment of smelters on the west coast would make\r\navailable a large reserve of ore (see also, however, p. 155).\r\n\r\nThe list of changes now under way or highly probable for the future\r\nmight be largely extended. The use of iron and steel is rapidly\r\nspreading through populous parts of the world which have heretofore\r\ndemanded little of these products. This increased use is favoring the\r\ndevelopment of local centers of smelting, which will make available\r\nother large reserves of iron ore. The growth of smelting in India, China\r\nand Australia illustrates this tendency.\r\n\r\nIron ore reserves are so large, so varied, and so widely distributed\r\nover the globe, that they will supply demands upon them to the remote\r\nfuture. Reserves become available and valuable only by the expenditure\r\nof effort and money. Ores are the multiplicand and man the multiplier in\r\nthe product which represents value or availability. Iron ore can be made\r\navailable, when needed, almost to any extent, but at highly varying cost\r\nand degree of effort. The highest grade ores, requiring minimum\r\nexpenditure to make them available, are distinctly limited as compared\r\nto total reserves. Any waste in their utilization will lead more quickly\r\nto the use of less available ores at higher cost. One of the significant\r\nconsequences of the exhaustion of the highest grade reserves will be an\r\nincreased draft upon fuel resources for the smelting of the lower grade\r\nores. Availability of iron ores is limited, not by total reserves, but\r\nby economic conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nIron rarely exists in nature as a separate element. It occurs mainly in\r\nminerals which represent combinations of iron, oxygen, and water, the\r\nsubstances which make up iron rust. Very broadly, most of the iron ores\r\nmight be crudely classified as iron rust. In detail this group is\r\nrepresented by several mineral varieties, principal among which are\r\nhematite (Fe_{2}O_{3}), magnetite (Fe_{3}O_{4}), and limonite (hydrated\r\nferric oxide). Iron likewise combines with a considerable variety of\r\nsubstances other than oxygen; and some of these compounds, as for\r\ninstance iron carbonate (siderite), iron silicate (chamosite,\r\nglauconite, etc.), and iron sulphide (pyrite), are locally mined as iron\r\nores. While an ore of iron may consist dominantly of some one of the\r\niron minerals, in few cases does it consist exclusively of one mineral.\r\nMost ores are mixtures of iron minerals.\r\n\r\nFully nine-tenths of the iron production of the world comes from the\r\nso-called hematite ores, meaning ores in which hematite is the dominant\r\nmineral, though most of them contain other iron minerals in smaller\r\nquantities. About 5 per cent of the world's iron ores are magnetites,\r\nand the remainder are limonites and iron carbonates.\r\n\r\nIron ores are represented in nearly all phases of the metamorphic cycle,\r\nbut the principal commercial values have been produced by processes of\r\nweathering and sedimentation at and near the surface.\r\n\r\n=Sedimentary iron ores.= Over 90 per cent of the world's production of\r\niron ore is from sedimentary rocks. The deposits consist in the main\r\neither of beds of iron ore which were originally deposited as such and\r\nhave undergone little subsequent alteration, or of those altered\r\nportions of lean ferruginous beds which since their deposition have been\r\nenriched or concentrated sufficiently to form ores. A minor class of\r\niron ores in sediments consists of deposits formed by secondary\r\nreplacement of limestones by surface waters carrying iron in solution.\r\n\r\n1. Deposits of the first class,--originally laid down in much their\r\npresent form,--are usually either oolitic, _i. e._, containing great\r\nnumbers of flat rounded grains of iron minerals like flaxseeds, or\r\nconsist in large part of fossil fragments of sea shells, replaced by\r\niron minerals. The Clinton ores of the Birmingham district, the Wabana\r\nores of Newfoundland, the minette ores of the Lorraine district in\r\ncentral Europe, and the oolitic ores of northern England are all of\r\nthese types. Their principal iron mineral is hematite, although the\r\nEnglish ores also contain considerable iron carbonate or siderite. The\r\ncementing or gangue materials are chiefly calcite and quartz, in\r\nvariable proportions.\r\n\r\nThe large reserves of high-grade hematite in the Minas Geraes district\r\nof Brazil are also original sediments, but lack the oolitic texture.\r\n\r\nAn insignificant proportion of the world's iron is obtained from \"bog\r\nores,\" which are sedimentary deposits of hydrated iron oxide in swamps\r\nand lakes. These ores have been used only on a small scale and chiefly\r\nin relatively undeveloped countries. They are of particular interest\r\nfrom a genetic standpoint in that they show the nature of some of the\r\nprocesses of iron ore deposition as it is actually going on today.\r\n\r\nNone of the ores of this class, with the exception of the iron\r\ncarbonates, have undergone any considerable surface enrichment since\r\ntheir primary deposition. Neither, with the exception of the Brazilian\r\nores, have they undergone any deep-seated metamorphism. The shapes,\r\nsizes, and distribution of the deposits may be traced back to the\r\nconditions of original deposition. In England and western Europe the\r\nprincipal deposits have been only slightly tilted by folding. In the\r\nUnited States the Clinton ores have partaken in the Appalachian folding.\r\nIn Brazil, the ores have undergone close folding and anamorphism.\r\n\r\n2. Deposits of the second class, which owe much of their value to\r\nfurther enrichment since deposition, are represented by the hematite\r\nores of the Lake Superior district. These may be thought of as the\r\nlocally rusted and leached portions of extensive \"iron formations,\" in\r\nwhich oxidation of the iron, and the leaching of silica and other\r\nsubstances by circulating waters, have left the less soluble iron\r\nminerals concentrated as ores. The Lake Superior iron formations now\r\nconsist near the surface mainly of interbanded quartz (or chert) and\r\nhematite, called _jasper_ or _ferruginous chert_ or _taconite_. These\r\nare similar in composition to the leaner iron ores of Brazil, called\r\n_itabirite_, but differ in that the silica is in the form of chemically\r\ndeposited chert, rather than fragmental quartz grains.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11. Alteration of Lake Superior iron\r\nformation to iron ore by the leaching of silica.]\r\n\r\nWhen originally deposited the iron was partly hematite (perhaps some\r\nmagnetite) and largely in the form of iron carbonate (siderite) and\r\niron silicate (greenalite), interbanded with chert. The original\r\ncondition is indicated by the facts that deep below the surface, in\r\nzones protected from weathering solutions, siderite and greenalite are\r\nabundant, and that they show complete gradation to hematite in\r\napproaching the surface. The ore has been concentrated in the iron\r\nformation almost solely by the process of leaching of silica by surface\r\nor meteoric waters, leaving the hematite in a porous mass. Figure 11\r\nillustrates this change as calculated from analyses and measurements of\r\npore space. During this process a very minor amount of iron has been\r\ntransported and redeposited. In short, the Lake Superior iron ores are\r\nresidual deposits formed by exactly the same weathering processes as\r\ncause the accumulation of clays, bauxites, and the oxide zones of\r\nsulphide deposits. The development of an iron ore rather than of other\r\nmaterials as an end-product is due merely to the peculiar composition of\r\nthe parent rock. The solution of silica on such an immense scale as is\r\nindicated by these deposits has sometimes been questioned on the general\r\nground that silica minerals are insoluble. However, there is plenty of\r\nevidence that such minerals _are_ soluble in nature; and the assumption\r\nof insolubility, so often made in geologic discussions, is based on the\r\nfact that most other minerals are _more_ soluble than silica minerals,\r\nand that in the end-products of weathering silica minerals therefore\r\nusually remain as important constituents. Iron oxide, on the other hand,\r\nis _less_ soluble even than silica,--with the result that when the two\r\noccur together, the evidence of leaching of silica from the mixture\r\nbecomes conspicuous.\r\n\r\nThe fact that these deposits are almost exclusively residual deposits\r\nformed by the leaching of silica has an important bearing on\r\nexploration. If they have been formed by the transportation and\r\ndeposition of iron from the surrounding rocks, there is no reason why\r\nthey should not occasionally be found in veins and dikes outside of the\r\niron formation. As a matter of fact they do not transgress a foot beyond\r\nthe limits of the iron formation. Failure to recognize the true nature\r\nof the concentration of these ores has sometimes led to their erroneous\r\nclassification as ores derived from the leaching and redeposition of\r\niron from the surrounding rocks.\r\n\r\nThe distribution and shapes of ore deposits of this class are far more\r\nirregular and capricious than those of the primary sediments, as would\r\nbe expected from the fact that their concentration has taken place\r\nthrough the agency of percolating waters from the surface, which worked\r\nalong devious channels determined by a vast variety of structural and\r\nlithological conditions. The working out of the structural conditions\r\nfor the different mines and districts constitutes one of the principal\r\ngeologic problems in exploration. These conditions have been fully\r\ndiscussed in the United States Geological Survey reports, and are so\r\nvarious that no attempt will be made to summarize them here.\r\n\r\nOne of the interesting features of the concentration of Lake Superior\r\niron ores is the fact that it took place long ago in the Keweenawan\r\nperiod, preceding the deposition of the flat-lying Cambrian formations,\r\nat a time when the topography was mountainous and the climate was arid\r\nor semi-arid. These conditions made it possible for the oxidizing and\r\nleaching solutions to penetrate very deeply, how deeply is not yet\r\nknown, but certainly to a depth below the present surface of 2,500 feet.\r\nAt present the water level is ordinarily within 100 feet of the surface,\r\nand oxidizing solutions are not going much below this depth. This\r\nregion, therefore, furnishes a good illustration of the intermittent and\r\ncyclic character of ore concentration which is now coming to be\r\nrecognized in many ore deposits.\r\n\r\nSubsequent changes far beneath the surface have folded, faulted, and\r\nmetamorphosed some of the Lake Superior iron ores but have not enriched\r\nthem. The same processes have recrystallized and locked together the\r\nminerals of some of the lean iron formations, making them hard and\r\nresistant, so that subsequent exposure and weathering have had little\r\neffect in enriching them to form commercial ores.\r\n\r\nThe weathering of limestones containing minor percentages of iron\r\nminerals originally deposited with the limestones may result in the\r\nresidual concentration of bodies of limonite or \"brown ores\" associated\r\nwith clays near the surface. This process is similar in all essential\r\nrespects to the concentration of the Lake Superior ores. Such limonitic\r\nores are found rather widely distributed through the Appalachian region\r\nand in many other parts of the world. Because of the ease with which\r\nthey can be mined and smelted on a small scale they have been used since\r\nearly times, but have furnished only a very small fraction of the\r\nworld's iron.\r\n\r\n3. In a third class of sedimentary ores, the iron minerals are supposed\r\nto have been introduced as replacements of limestones subsequent to\r\nsedimentation. Such ores are not always easy to discriminate from ores\r\nresulting primarily from sedimentation. This class is represented by the\r\nhigh-grade deposits of Bilbao, Spain, Austrian deposits, and by smaller\r\ndeposits in other countries. The Bilbao ores consist mainly of siderite,\r\nwhich near the surface has altered to large bodies of oxide minerals.\r\nThey occur in limestones and shales and are not associated with igneous\r\nrocks. The deposits are believed to have been formed by ordinary surface\r\nwaters carrying iron in solution, and depositing it in the form of iron\r\ncarbonate as replacements of the limestones. The original source of the\r\niron is believed to have been small quantities of iron minerals\r\ndisseminated through the ordinary country rocks of the district. The\r\naction of surface waters, in thus concentrating the iron in certain\r\nlocalities which are favorable for precipitation, is similar to the\r\nformation of the lead and zinc ores of the Mississippi valley, referred\r\nto in the next chapter. Deposits formed in this manner may be roughly\r\ntabular and resemble bedded deposits, or they may be of very irregular\r\nshapes.\r\n\r\nThe sedimentary iron ores in general evidently represent an advanced\r\nstage of katamorphism, and illustrate the tendency of this phase of the\r\nmetamorphic cycle toward simplification and segregation of certain\r\nmaterials. The exact conditions of original sedimentation present one\r\nof the great unsolved problems of geology, referred to in Chapter III.\r\n\r\n=Iron ores associated with igneous rocks.= About five per cent of the\r\nworld's production of iron ore is from bodies of magnetite formed in\r\nassociation with igneous rocks. These are dense, highly crystalline\r\nores, in which the iron minerals are tightly locked up with silicates,\r\nquartz, and other minerals, suggestive of high temperature origin. The\r\nlargest of these deposits is at Kiruna in northern Sweden; in fact this\r\nis the largest single deposit of high-grade ore of any kind yet known in\r\nthe world. Here the magnetite forms a great tabular vertical body lying\r\nbetween porphyry and syenite. In the Adirondack Mountains of New York\r\nand in the highlands of New Jersey, magnetites are interbedded and\r\ninfolded with gneisses, granites, and metamorphic limestones. In the\r\nwestern United States there are many magnetite deposits, not yet mined,\r\nat contacts between igneous intrusives and sedimentary rocks,\r\nparticularly limestones (so-called \"contact-metamorphic\" deposits). The\r\nores of the Cornwall district of Pennsylvania and some of the Chilean,\r\nChinese, and Japanese ores are of the same type.\r\n\r\nMagnetites containing titanium, which prevents their use at the present\r\ntime, are known in many parts of the world as segregations in basic\r\nigneous rocks. They are actually parts of the igneous rock itself (p.\r\n34). Among the large deposits of this nature are certain titaniferous\r\nores of the Adirondacks, of Wyoming, and of the Scandinavian peninsula.\r\n\r\nIn all of these cases, it is clear that the origin of the ores is in\r\nsome way related to igneous processes, and presumably most of the ores\r\nare deposited from the primary hot solutions accompanying and following\r\nthe intrusion of the igneous rocks; but thus far it has been difficult\r\nto find definite and positive evidence as to the precise processes\r\ninvolved. None of these deposits have undergone any important secondary\r\nenrichment at the surface. Their sizes, shapes, and distribution are\r\ngoverned by conditions of igneous intrusion, more or less modified, as\r\nin the Adirondacks, by later deformation.\r\n\r\n=Iron ores due to weathering of igneous rocks.= A small part of the\r\nworld's iron ores, less than 1 per cent of the total production, are the\r\nresult of surface alteration of serpentine rocks. These ores are mined\r\nprincipally in Cuba (Fig. 12). Here they have been developed on a\r\nplateau-like area on which erosion is sluggish. The process of formation\r\nhas been one of oxidation of the iron minerals and leaching of most of\r\nthe other constituents, leaving the iron concentrated near the surface\r\nin blanket-like deposits. The minerals of the original rock contained\r\nalumina, which, like the iron, is insoluble under weathering conditions,\r\nand hence the Cuban iron ores are high in alumina. They also contain\r\nsmall quantities of nickel and chromium which have been concentrated\r\nwith the iron. A large part of the iron minerals, especially where close\r\nto the surface, have been gathered into small shot-like nodules called\r\n_pisolites_. It is thought that the solution and redeposition of the\r\niron by organic acids from plant roots may be at least a contributing\r\ncause in the formation of this pisolitic texture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12. Representing in terms of weight the\r\nmineralogical changes in the katamorphism of serpentine rock to iron\r\nore, on the assumption that alumina has remained constant, eastern\r\nCuba.]\r\n\r\nThe Cuban iron ores are similar in their origin to _laterites_, which\r\nare surface accumulations of clay, bauxite, and iron oxide minerals,\r\nresulting from the weathering of iron-bearing, commonly igneous, rocks.\r\nThe typical laterites carry more clay and bauxite than the Cuban iron\r\nores, but this is due merely to the fact that the original rocks\r\ncommonly carry more materials which weather to clay. In fact the Cuban\r\niron ores are themselves, broadly speaking, laterites.\r\n\r\n=Iron ores due to weathering of sulphide ores.= A relatively minute\r\nportion of the world's iron ore comes from the \"gossans\" or \"iron caps\"\r\nover deposits of iron sulphides. The gossans are formed by oxidation and\r\nleaching of other minerals from the deposits, leaving limonite or\r\nhematite in concentrated masses (see pp. 46-47).\r\n\r\n\r\nMANGANESE ORES\r\n\r\n\r\nECONOMIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nManganese ores are used mainly in the manufacture of steel, the alloys\r\nspiegeleisen and ferromanganese being added to the molten steel after\r\ntreatment in the Bessemer converter and open-hearth furnace in order to\r\nrecarburize and purify the metal. The alloy ferromanganese is also used\r\nin the production of special manganese steels. Manganese ore is used in\r\nrelatively small amounts in dry batteries, in the manufacture of\r\nmanganese chemicals, in glass making, and in pigments. Steel uses 95 per\r\ncent of the total manganese consumed, batteries and chemicals 5 per\r\ncent. On an average each ton of steel in the United States requires 14\r\npounds of metallic manganese, equivalent to 40 pounds of manganese ore.\r\n\r\nWith manganese ores, as with iron ores, the percentage of minor\r\nconstituents,--phosphorus, silica, sulphur, etc.,--determines to a large\r\nextent the manner of use. Low-grade manganese ores, ranging from 10 to\r\n35 per cent in manganese, 20 to 35 per cent in iron, and containing less\r\nthan 20 per cent of silica, are used mainly in the production of the\r\nlow-grade iron-manganese alloy called _spiegeleisen_ or _spiegel_ (16 to\r\n32 per cent manganese). The higher-grade ores, ranging from 35 to 55 per\r\ncent in manganese, are used mainly in the production of the high-grade\r\nalloy called _ferromanganese_ or _ferro_, in which the manganese\r\nconstitutes 65 to 80 per cent of the total. To a very limited extent\r\nmanganese is smelted directly with iron ores, thus lessening the amount\r\nto be introduced in the form of alloys; this, however, is regarded as\r\nwasteful use of manganese, since its effectiveness as so used is not\r\nvery great. Steel makers usually prefer to introduce manganese in the\r\nform of ferromanganese rather than as spiegel. On the other hand, the\r\nores of the United States as a whole are better adapted to the\r\nmanufacture of spiegel. With the shutting off of foreign high-grade\r\nsupplies during the war, resulting in the increased use of local ores,\r\nit became necessary to use larger amounts of the spiegel which could be\r\nmade from these ores. Metallurgists stated that it was theoretically\r\npossible to substitute spiegel for the higher grade alloy up to 70 per\r\ncent of the total manganese requirement, but in actual practice this\r\nsubstitution did not get much beyond 18 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe principal manganese ore-producing countries in normal times are\r\nRussia, India, and Brazil. Relatively little ore is used in these\r\ncountries, most of it being sent to the consuming countries of Europe\r\nand to the United States. The Indian ore has been used largely by\r\nBritish steel plants, but much of it also has gone to the United States,\r\nBelgium, France, and Germany. The Russian ore has been used by all five\r\nof these countries, Germany having a considerable degree of commercial\r\ncontrol and receiving the largest part; a small quantity is also used in\r\nRussia. Brazilian ore has gone mainly to the United States, and in part\r\nto France, Germany, and England.\r\n\r\nSmaller amounts of manganese ore have been produced in Germany,\r\nAustria-Hungary, Spain, and Japan. This production has had little effect\r\non the world situation. That produced in Austria-Hungary and Germany is\r\nused in the domestic industry. That from Spain and Japan is in large\r\npart exported.\r\n\r\nThe highest grade of manganese ore comes from the Russian mines,\r\nespecially those in the Caucasus region. Most of the ore used for the\r\nmanufacture of dry batteries and in the chemical industry, where\r\nhigh-grade ores are required, has come from Russia. By far the larger\r\npart of the Russian production, however, has gone into steel\r\nmanufacture. Indian and Brazilian ores have likewise been used mainly in\r\nthe steel industry. Some Japanese ore also is of high grade and is used\r\nfor chemical and battery purposes.\r\n\r\nNature has not endowed the United States very abundantly with manganese\r\nores, and such as are known are widely scattered, of relatively small\r\ntonnage, and of a wide range of grade. The principal producing districts\r\nare the Philipsburg district of Montana and the Cuyuna Range of\r\nMinnesota; there are also scattering supplies in Virginia, Arizona,\r\nCalifornia, and many other states. The use of domestic ores has\r\nsometimes been unsatisfactory, because of frequent failure of domestic\r\nproducers to deliver amounts and grades contracted for. It has been, on\r\nthe whole, cheaper, easier, and more satisfactory for the large\r\nconsumers to purchase the imported ore, which is delivered in any\r\ndesired amount and in uniform grades, rather than to try to assemble\r\nusable mixtures from various parts of the country.\r\n\r\nBefore the European War, the United States produced only 1 to 2 per cent\r\nof its needed supply of manganese, the rest being imported mainly from\r\nIndia, Russia, and Brazil, in the form of ore, and from England in the\r\nform of ferromanganese (about half of the total requirement). The\r\npartial closing of the first two and the fourth of these sources of\r\nsupply under war conditions made it necessary to turn for ore to Brazil\r\nand also to Cuba, where American interests developed a considerable\r\nindustry in medium-grade ores. At the same time steps were taken to\r\ndevelop domestic resources; and with the high prices imposed by war\r\nconditions, the domestic production, both of high- and low-grade ore,\r\nwas increased largely, but still was able to supply only 35 per cent of\r\nthe total requirements of manganese.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the war sufficient progress had been made--in the\r\ndiscovery of many new deposits in the United States, in the use of\r\nlow-grade domestic ores, which before had not been able to compete with\r\nimported ores, and in the increased use of spiegel, allowing wider use\r\nof low-grade ores,--to demonstrate that, if absolutely necessary, and at\r\nhigh cost, the United States in another year or two could have been\r\nnearly self-sufficing in regard to its manganese requirements. The\r\nrelease of shipping from war demands resulted immediately in larger\r\nofferings of foreign manganese ore and of ferromanganese from England,\r\nat prices which would not allow of competition from much of the domestic\r\nor Cuban ore production or from the domestic manufacture of alloys. The\r\nresult was a rather dramatic closing down of the manganese industry,\r\nwith much financial loss, the passage of a bill for reimbursement of\r\nproducers, and a demand on the part of the producers, though not of\r\nconsumers, for a protective tariff. In the questions thus raised it is\r\ndesirable that geologists and engineers professionally connected with\r\nthe industry thoroughly understand the basic facts; for they are liable\r\nto be called upon for advice, not only on questions relating to domestic\r\nsupplies affected by possible future foreign policies, but on the\r\nformulation of the policies themselves. Conservation, cheaper steel, and\r\nfuture trade relations of the United States all require consideration,\r\nbefore action is taken to protect this one of several similarly situated\r\nmineral industries, in the effort to make the country self-supporting.\r\nThese questions are further dealt with in Chapters XVII and XVIII.\r\n\r\nManganese production was also developed during the war in the Gold Coast\r\nof West Africa, in Costa Rica, in Panama, in Java, and elsewhere; but\r\nwith the possible exception of Java and Chile, none of these sources are\r\nlikely to be factors in the world situation. The war-developed manganese\r\nproduction of Italy, France, Sweden, and United Kingdom is also unlikely\r\nto continue on any important scale.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nLike iron ores, manganese ores consist principally of the oxides of\r\nmanganese (pyrolusite, psilomelane, manganite, wad, and others), and\r\nrarely the carbonate of manganese (rhodochrosite). They are similar in\r\ntheir geologic occurrence to many of the iron ores and are often mixed\r\nwith iron ores as manganiferous iron ores and ferruginous manganese\r\nores.\r\n\r\nThe higher grade manganese ores are of two general types. Those of the\r\nCaucasus district in Russia are sedimentary beds, oolitic in texture,\r\nwhich were originally deposited as rather pure manganese oxides, and\r\nwhich have undergone little secondary concentration. They are mined in\r\nmany places in much the same manner as coal. Those of India and Brazil\r\nare chiefly surface concentrations of the manganese oxides, formed by\r\nthe weathering of underlying rocks which contain manganese carbonates\r\nand silicates. The origin of the primary manganese minerals in the\r\nIndian and in some of the Brazilian deposits is obscure. In others of\r\nthe Brazilian ores, the manganese was deposited in sedimentary layers\r\ninterbedded with siliceous \"iron formations,\" and the whole series has\r\nsubsequently been altered and recrystallized.\r\n\r\nThe manganese ores of Philipsburg, Montana, the principal large\r\nhigh-grade deposits mined in the United States, were derived by surface\r\nweathering from manganese carbonates which form replacements in\r\nlimestone near the contact with a great batholith of granodiorite. The\r\nprimary manganese minerals probably owe their origin to hot magmatic\r\nsolutions, as suggested by the close association of the ores with the\r\nigneous rock, the presence of minerals containing chlorine, fluorine,\r\nand boron, and the development in the limestone of dense silicates and\r\nmineral associations characteristic of hot-water alteration. The\r\nmanganese ores are mined principally in the oxidized zone. Rich silver\r\nores are found below the water table, but mainly in veins independent of\r\nthe manganese deposits.\r\n\r\nAt Butte, Montana, a little high-grade manganese material has been\r\nobtained from the unoxidized pink manganese carbonate, which is a common\r\nmineral in some of the veins. It is associated with quartz and metallic\r\nsulphides and is similar in origin to the copper ores of the same\r\ndistrict (pp. 201-202).\r\n\r\nThe lower-grade and the more ferruginous manganese ores are of a\r\nsomewhat similar origin to the principal high-grade ores, in that they\r\nrepresent surface concentrations of the oxides from smaller percentages\r\nof the carbonates and silicates in the rocks below. Deposits of this\r\nnature have been derived from a wide variety of parent rocks--from\r\ncontact zones around igneous intrusions, from fissure veins of various\r\norigins, from calcareous and clayey sediments, and from slates and\r\nschists. The manganese and manganiferous iron ores of the Cuyuna\r\ndistrict of Minnesota, the largest source of low-grade ores in this\r\ncountry, were formed by the action of weathering processes on\r\nsedimentary beds of manganese and iron carbonates constituting \"iron\r\nformations.\" The process is the same as the concentration of Lake\r\nSuperior iron ores described elsewhere.\r\n\r\nManganese, like iron, is less soluble than most of the rock\r\nconstituents, and tends to remain in the outcrop under weathering\r\nconditions. To some extent also it is dissolved and reprecipitated, and\r\nis thus gathered into concretions and irregular nodular deposits in the\r\nresidual clays. In some cases it is closely associated with iron\r\nminerals; in others, due to its slightly greater solubility, it has been\r\nseparated from the iron and segregated into relatively pure masses. With\r\nmanganese, as with iron, katamorphic processes are responsible for the\r\nconcentration of most of the ores. The ores are in general surface\r\nproducts, and rarely extend to depths of over a hundred feet.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHROME (OR CHROMITE) ORES\r\n\r\n\r\nECONOMIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nThe principal use of chrome ores is in the making of the alloy\r\nferrochrome (60 to 70 per cent chromium), used for the manufacture of\r\nchrome, chrome-nickel, and other steels. These steels have great\r\ntoughness and hardness, and are used for armor-plate, projectiles,\r\nhigh-speed cutting tools, automobile frames, safe-deposit vaults, and\r\nother purposes. Chrome ore is used also both in the crude form and in\r\nthe form of bricks for refractory linings in furnaces, chiefly\r\nopen-hearth steel furnaces; and as the raw material for bichromates and\r\nother chemicals, which are used in paints and in tanning of leather. In\r\nthe United States in normal times about 35 per cent of the total\r\nchromite consumed is used in the manufacture of ferrochrome, and about\r\n35 per cent for bichromate manufacture, leaving 30 per cent for\r\nrefractory and other purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the higher commercial grades of chrome ore the percentage of chromic\r\noxide is 45 to 55 per cent, but under war conditions ore as low as 30\r\nper cent in Cr_{2}O_{3} was mined. Recovery of chrome from slags\r\nresulting from the smelting of chromiferous iron ores was one of the\r\nwar-time developments.\r\n\r\nThe principal chromite-producing countries in normal times are New\r\nCaledonia, and Rhodesia (controlled by French and British interests),\r\nand to a somewhat lesser extent Russia and Turkey (Asia Minor). Small\r\namounts of chromite are mined in Greece, India, Japan, and other\r\ncountries. The Indian deposits in particular are large and high-grade\r\nbut have been handicapped by inadequate transportation. The production\r\nof chrome ore in New Caledonia, Rhodesia, Russia, and Turkey has usually\r\namounted to more than 90 per cent of the total world's production. The\r\nore from New Caledonia has been used by France, Germany, England, and to\r\nsome extent by the United States. Rhodesian ore has been used by the\r\nUnited States and the principal European consumers. Latterly more\r\nRhodesian ore has gone to Europe and more Caledonian ore to the United\r\nStates. The Russian ore has been in part used in Russia and in part\r\nexported, probably going mainly to France and Germany. The Turkish ore\r\nhas been exported to the United States, England, and Germany; it\r\nprobably supplied most of Germany's chromite requirements during the\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nDuring the war the United States was temporarily an important producer,\r\nas were also Canada, Brazil, Cuba, and to a minor degree Guatemala.\r\n\r\nThe richest chrome ore mined at present comes from Guatemala, but the\r\nmines are relatively inaccessible. The New Caledonian, Rhodesian,\r\nRussian, Turkish, and Indian ores are also of high grade. The ores mined\r\nin the United States, Canada, Brazil, Cuba, Greece, and Japan are of\r\nlower grade.\r\n\r\nThe use of domestic chromite supplies in the United States presents much\r\nthe same problem as does manganese. The ore bodies are small, scattered,\r\nand of a generally law grade. War-time experience showed that they could\r\nbe made to meet a large part of the United States requirements, but at\r\nhigh cost and at the risk of early exhaustion of reserves. California\r\nand Oregon are the principal sources, and incidental amounts have been\r\nproduced in Washington, Wyoming, and some of the Atlantic states. With\r\nthe resumption of competition from foreign high-grade ores at the close\r\nof the war, the domestic mining industry was practically wiped out; the\r\nconsequences being financial distress, partial direct relief from\r\nCongress, and consideration of the possibilities of a protective\r\ntariff,--which in this case would have to be a large one to accomplish\r\nthe desired results (see Chapters XVII and XVIII).\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nThe principal chrome mineral is chromite, an oxide of chromium and iron.\r\nChromite is a common minor constituent of basic igneous rocks of the\r\nperidotite and pyroxenite type. In these rocks it occurs both as\r\ndisseminated grains, and as stringers, and large irregular masses which\r\nprobably represent magmatic segregations. Alteration, and weathering of\r\nthe parent rock, forming first serpentine and then residual clays, make\r\nthe chromite bodies progressively richer and more available, by leaching\r\nout the soluble constituents of the rock leaving the chromite as\r\nresidual concentrates. All the important chromite deposits of the world\r\nare associated in somewhat this manner with serpentine or related\r\nrocks. They are formed in the same way as the lateritic iron ores of\r\nCuba, and from the same sort of rocks (pp. 171-173). Chromite is very\r\ninsoluble, and the mechanical breaking down of deposits and\r\ntransportation by streams frequently forms placers of chrome sands and\r\ngravels. Such placers have not been worked to any extent.\r\n\r\nKatamorphic processes give the important values to chromite deposits.\r\n\r\n\r\nNICKEL ORES\r\n\r\n\r\nECONOMIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nThe principal use of nickel is in the manufacture of nickel steel, the\r\nmost important of all alloy steels. Ordinary nickel steels carry about\r\n3-1/2 per cent nickel. Nickel is used in all gun and armor-plate steels,\r\nand in practically all other good steels except tool steels. It is also\r\nextensively alloyed with other metals, particularly with copper to form\r\nthe strong non-corrosive metal (monel metal) used for ship propellers\r\nand like purposes. Nickel is also used for electroplating, for nickel\r\ncoins, for chemicals, etc. Of the total production about 60 per cent is\r\nused in steels, 20 per cent in non-ferrous alloys and 20 per cent in\r\nmiscellaneous uses. The ores mined range from 2 to 6 per cent in\r\nmetallic nickel.\r\n\r\nCanada (Sudbury, Ontario) produces over three-fourths of the world's\r\nnickel and is likely to have an even greater share of the future\r\nproduction. The French supply from New Caledonia is second in\r\nimportance, and minor amounts are produced in Norway and in several\r\nother countries. The control and movement of the Canadian and New\r\nCaledonian supplies are the salient features of the world nickel\r\nsituation. Nickel leaves the producing countries mostly as matte.\r\nCanadian matte has been refined mainly in the United States, but the\r\ntendency is toward refining a larger proportion in Canada. In Europe\r\nthere are refineries in France, England, Belgium, Germany, and Norway,\r\nwhich normally treat the bulk of the New Caledonian and some of the\r\nCanadian production. Small quantities of New Caledonian matte or ore are\r\nalso refined in Japan, and during the war considerable amounts came to\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nThe United States now produces perhaps 10 per cent of its normal\r\nrequirements of nickel from domestic sources, principally as a\r\nby-product of copper refining. However, the United States has a large\r\nfinancial interest in the Canadian deposits, and refines most of the\r\nmatte produced from Sudbury ores in a New Jersey refinery. Shipments to\r\nEurope of Canadian nickel refined in the United States have been a\r\nfeature of the world's trade in the past.\r\n\r\nThe nickel-bearing iron ores of Cuba, consumed in the United States,\r\nconstitute a potential nickel supply of some importance, if processes of\r\npreparation become commercially perfected.\r\n\r\nKnown supplies of nickel in Canada and New Caledonia are ample for a\r\nconsiderable future, and geologic conditions promise additional\r\ndiscoveries at least in the former field. The probable reserves of the\r\nSudbury district have been estimated to be fully 100,000,000 tons, which\r\nwould supply the world's normal pre-war requirements for about a hundred\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nIn recent years the British and Canadian governments have taken an\r\nactive interest in the nickel industry. They organized a joint\r\ncommission for its investigation, the report[31] of which furnishes the\r\nmost comprehensive view of the world nickel situation yet available. The\r\nBritish government has directly invested in shares of the\r\nBritish-American Nickel Company, and has negotiated European contracts\r\nfor sale of nickel for this company. The Canadian government has exerted\r\nsome pressure toward larger refining of nickel matte in Canada.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nThe principal ore minerals are the nickel sulphides and arsenides\r\n(particularly pentlandite, but also millerite, niccolite, and others),\r\nwhich are found at Sudbury intergrown with the iron and copper\r\nsulphides, pyrrhotite and chalcopyrite; and the hydrated\r\nnickel-magnesium silicates (garnierite and genthite), which are products\r\nof weathering. The richer ores of Canada contain about 5 or 6 per cent\r\nof nickel, the New Caledonian ores less than 2 per cent. The Sudbury\r\nores carry also an average of about 1.5 per cent of copper.\r\n\r\nNickel, while present in the average igneous rock in greater amounts\r\nthan copper, lead, or zinc, is apparently not so readily concentrated in\r\nnature as the other metals and is rarely found in workable deposits. The\r\nfew ore bodies known have been formed as the result of unusual\r\nsegregation of the nickel in highly magnesian igneous rock of the norite\r\nor gabbro type, at the time of its solidification or soon after; and in\r\nsome cases, in order to produce the nickel ore, still further\r\nconcentration by the agency of weathering has been necessary. Thus there\r\nare two main types of deposits.\r\n\r\nThe first, the sulphide type, is represented by the great ore bodies of\r\nthe Sudbury district. These are situated in the basal portions of a\r\ngreat norite intrusive, and are ascribed to segregation of the sulphides\r\nas the rock solidified. To some extent the segregation was aided by\r\nmineralizing solutions following the crystallization of the magma, but\r\nin general there is little evidence that the ores were deposited from\r\nvagrant solutions of this kind (see pp. 34-35). These ores owe their\r\nvalue to primary concentration; secondary transportation and\r\nreprecipitation by surface waters has not been important. A small amount\r\nof the green arsenate, annabergite or \"nickel bloom,\" has been developed\r\nby oxidation at the surface.\r\n\r\nThe second, the garnierite or \"lateritic\" type of nickel ores, is\r\nsomewhat more common and is represented by the deposits of New\r\nCaledonia. In this locality the original rock is a peridotite,\r\nrelatively low in nickel, which has been altered to serpentine.\r\nWeathering has concentrated the more resistant nickel at the expense of\r\nthe more soluble minerals, and has produced extensive blanket deposits\r\nof clay, which in their lower portions contain nickel in profitable\r\namounts. Similar processes, working on material of a somewhat different\r\noriginal composition, have produced the nickel-bearing and\r\nchrome-bearing iron ores of Cuba (pp. 171-173).\r\n\r\n\r\nTUNGSTEN (WOLFRAM) ORES\r\n\r\n\r\nECONOMIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nThe principal use of tungsten is in the making of high speed tool\r\nsteels. It is added either as the powdered metal or in the form of\r\nferrotungsten, an alloy containing 70 to 90 per cent of tungsten.\r\nTungsten is also used for filaments in incandescent lamps, and in\r\ncontacts for internal combustion engines, being a substitute for\r\nplatinum in the latter use. Of late years tungsten alloys have also been\r\nused in valves of airplane and automobile engines.\r\n\r\nThe average grade of tungsten ores mined in the United States is less\r\nthan 3 per cent of the metal; before smelting they are concentrated to\r\nan average grade of 60 per cent tungsten oxide.\r\n\r\nGermany through its smelting interests controlled the foreign tungsten\r\nsituation prior to the war; two-thirds of its excess output of\r\nferrotungsten was consumed by England and the balance principally by the\r\nUnited States and France. Other consumers in the main satisfied their\r\nrequirements by imports of tool steel from these four countries.\r\n\r\nThe bulk of the tungsten ore consumed in Europe prior to 1914 came from\r\nBritish possessions; these were principally the Federated Malay States,\r\nBurma, Australia, and New Zealand. The United States, Portugal, Bolivia,\r\nJapan, Siam, Argentina, and Peru were also producers. The great demand\r\nfor tungsten created by the war added China to the list of important\r\nproducers and greatly increased the production from Burma and Bolivia.\r\nSmelting works were established in England and those of the United\r\nStates and France were greatly enlarged. England is at present in a\r\nposition to dominate the world tungsten situation. The question of\r\ncontrol of the ores obtainable in China, Korea, Siam, Portugal, and\r\nwestern South America is likely to be an important one for the future.\r\n\r\nOf the annual pre-war world production, the United States used about\r\none-fifth. Three-fourths of this requirement was met by domestic\r\nproduction. The balance was obtained by importation, chiefly from\r\nGermany, from Portugal and Spain, and from England, both of concentrates\r\nand of ferrotungsten.\r\n\r\nTo the considerable demand for high speed tool steels occasioned by\r\nmunitions manufacture, production in the United States responded\r\nquickly. Supplies of tungsten came chiefly from California, Colorado,\r\nArizona, Nevada, and South Dakota. At the same time importation largely\r\nincreased, chiefly from the west coast of South America and the Orient.\r\nConsumption reached a half of the world's total. Considerable amounts of\r\nferrotungsten were exported to the Allies.\r\n\r\nThe end of the war created a possible tungsten shortage in this country\r\ninto a tungsten surplus. In so far as actual domestic consumption is\r\nconcerned there has been a return to something like pre-war conditions,\r\nas the only known new use to which tungsten may be put--the manufacture\r\nof die steel--does not involve the use of any large amount of\r\nferrotungsten. The richer mines of the two chief tungsten-producing\r\ndistricts in the United States have shown impoverishment and at present\r\nno important new deposits are known. The grade of the producing deposits\r\nis on an average low. The domestic production of tungsten ore will\r\ndoubtless decrease, owing to the importation of cheaper foreign ores,\r\nunless a high tariff wall is erected. Importation from the Orient and\r\nthe west coast of South America should continue in reduced amounts,\r\ndepending upon the ability of domestic manufacturers to obtain and hold\r\nforeign markets for ferrotungsten and high speed tool steel. In the\r\ncommercial control of tungsten ores the United States has at present a\r\nstrong position, second only to that of England.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nTungsten ores contain tungsten principally in the form of the minerals\r\nscheelite (calcium tungstate), ferberite (iron tungstate), huebnerite\r\n(manganese tungstate), and wolframite (iron-manganese tungstate). All\r\nthese minerals are relatively insoluble and have high specific gravity,\r\nand as a consequence they are frequently accumulated in placers, along\r\nwith cassiterite and other stable, heavy minerals. A large part of the\r\nworld's tungsten production in the past has been won from such deposits.\r\nPlacers are still important producers in China, Siam, and Bolivia,\r\nalthough in these countries vein deposits are also worked.\r\n\r\nWith the exhaustion of the more easily worked placer deposits,\r\nincreasing amounts of tungsten are being obtained from the primary or\r\nfixed deposits. These are found almost exclusively in association with\r\ngranitic rocks, and have a variety of forms. The most productive\r\ndeposits are in the form of veins, cutting the granites and the\r\nsurrounding rocks into which the granites were intruded, and containing\r\nquartz, metallic sulphides, and in some cases minerals of tin, gold, and\r\nsilver. The deposits of the two most important districts in the United\r\nStates, in Boulder County, Colorado, and at Atolia, California, are of\r\nthis general nature. The close association of such deposits with\r\nplutonic igneous rocks, and the characteristic mineral associations (see\r\npp. 37-41) suggest strongly that the deposits were formed by hot\r\nsolutions deriving their material from a magmatic source.\r\n\r\nOther tungsten deposits, which only recently became of importance, are\r\nof the contact-metamorphic type--in limestones which have been invaded\r\nby hot aqueous and gaseous solutions near the borders of granitic\r\nintrusions. In these occurrences the tungsten mineral is almost\r\ninvariably scheelite, and is associated with calcite, garnet, pyroxene,\r\nand other silicates. A magmatic origin of the tungsten is probable. Some\r\nof the deposits of the Great Basin area and of Japan are of this nature,\r\nand it is believed that important deposits of this type may be\r\ndiscovered in many other countries.\r\n\r\nTungsten is likewise found in original segregations in igneous rocks and\r\nin pegmatite dikes, but these deposits are of comparatively small\r\ncommercial importance.\r\n\r\nIn some tungsten deposits a hydrated oxide called tungstite has been\r\nformed as a canary-yellow coating at the surface. On the whole, however,\r\ntungsten minerals are very resistant to weathering, and in all their\r\ndeposits secondary concentration by chemical action at the surface has\r\nnot played any appreciable part. The disappearance of tungsten minerals\r\nfrom alluvial materials which are undergoing laterization, which has\r\nbeen described in Burma,[32] seems to indicate that the tungsten is\r\ndissolved in surface waters to some extent; but in the main it is\r\nprobably carried completely out of the vicinity and not reprecipitated\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\n\r\nMOLYBDENUM ORES\r\n\r\n\r\nECONOMIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nThe main use of molybdenum is in the manufacture of high-speed tool\r\nsteels, in which it has been used as a partial or complete substitute\r\nfor tungsten. Its steel-hardening qualities are more effective than\r\nthose of tungsten, but it is more difficult to control metallurgically.\r\nIt has been used in piston rods and crank shafts for American\r\nairplanes. Its use in tool steel is mainly confined to Europe, where its\r\nmetallurgical application is in a more advanced stage than in the United\r\nStates. Molybdenum is added to steel either as powdered molybdenum or in\r\nthe form of ferromolybdenum, an alloy containing 60 to 70 per cent of\r\nthe metal. Molybdenum chemicals are essential reagents in iron and steel\r\nanalysis and other analytical work; they are also used as pigments.\r\nMolybdenum metal has been used to a small extent in incandescent lamps\r\nand as a substitute for platinum in electric contacts and resistances.\r\n\r\nMolybdenum ores range from considerably less than 1 per cent to about 5\r\nper cent in molybdenum.\r\n\r\nThe world's principal sources of molybdenum ores in approximate order of\r\nimportance are the United States, Canada, Norway, Australia, Korea,\r\nAustria, Peru, and Mexico.\r\n\r\nAbout half of the world's supply is produced in the United States.\r\nProduction of molybdenum in this country practically began in 1914. Most\r\nof the production has come from Colorado and Arizona. It is believed\r\nthat the United States contains reserves more than sufficient to meet\r\nany possible future demand. Thus far the demand has not kept up with\r\ncapacity for production. The principal consuming countries are England,\r\nFrance, and Germany.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nThe chief ore minerals are molybdenite (molybdenum sulphide) and\r\nwulfenite (lead molybdate). The larger part of the world's production is\r\nfrom the molybdenite ores. Molybdenite occurs principally in association\r\nwith granitic rocks,--in pegmatite dikes, in veins, and in\r\ncontact-metamorphic deposits,--in all of which associations its origin\r\nis traced to hot solutions from the magma. It is frequently present as\r\nan accessory mineral in sulphide deposits containing ores of gold,\r\ncopper, silver, lead, and zinc. At Empire, Colorado, one of the\r\nprincipal producing localities, it is found in veins, associated with\r\npyrite, and filling the interstices between brecciated fragments of a\r\nwall rock composed of alaskite (an acid igneous rock). In molybdenite\r\ndeposits secondary concentration has not been important.\r\n\r\nWulfenite is rather common in the upper oxidized zone of deposits which\r\ncontain lead minerals and molybdenite. It is probably always secondary.\r\nDeposits of wulfenite have been worked on a small scale in Arizona.\r\n\r\n\r\nVANADIUM ORES\r\n\r\n\r\nECONOMIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nVanadium is used mainly in steel, to which it gives great toughness and\r\ntorsional strength. Vanadium steels are used in locomotive tires,\r\nframes, and springs, in those parts of automobiles that must withstand\r\nspecial bending strains, in transmission shafts, and in general in\r\nforgings which must stand heavy wear and tear. Vanadium is also used in\r\nhigh-speed tool steels, its use materially reducing the amount of\r\ntungsten necessary. It is added in the form of ferrovanadium, carrying\r\n35 to 40 per cent of vanadium. Another use of vanadium is in\r\nchrome-vanadium steels for armor-plate and automobiles. Minor amounts\r\nare used in making bronzes, in medicine, and in dyeing.\r\n\r\nThe low-grade ores of the United States range from 1 to 8 per cent of\r\nvanadium oxide, the general mean being nearer the lower figure. The\r\nhigh-grade ores of Peru contain from about 10 to as high as 50 per cent\r\nof the oxide; the roasted ore as shipped averages about 35 to 40 per\r\ncent.\r\n\r\nTwo-thirds of the world's supply of vanadium comes from Peru, where the\r\nmines are under American control. The concentrates are all shipped to\r\nthe United States and some of the ferrovanadium is exported from this\r\ncountry to Europe. The Germans during the war supplied their needs for\r\nvanadium from the minette iron ores in the Briey district in France, and\r\npresumably the French will in the future utilize this source. An\r\nunrecorded but small quantity is obtained by the English from\r\nlead-vanadate mines in South Africa. There are some fairly large\r\ndeposits of vanadium minerals in Asiatic Russia, which may ultimately\r\nbecome an important source.\r\n\r\nThe United States supplies less than one-half of its normal needs of\r\nvanadium, from southwestern Colorado and southeastern Utah. The grade of\r\nthese deposits is low and the quantity in sight does not seem to promise\r\na long future. Through its commercial control of the Peruvian deposits,\r\nthe United States dominates the world's vanadium situation.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nThe Minasragra vanadium deposit of Peru contains patronite (vanadium\r\nsulphide) associated with a peculiar nickel-bearing sulphide and a black\r\ncarbonaceous mineral called \"quisqueite,\" in a lens-shaped body of\r\nunknown depth, enclosed by red shales and porphyry dikes. The origin is\r\nunknown. The patronite has altered at the surface to red and brown\r\nhydrated vanadium oxides.\r\n\r\nThe deposits of Colorado and Utah are large lens-shaped bodies\r\ncontaining roscoelite (a vanadium-bearing mica) in fissures and\r\nbrecciated zones and replacing the cementing materials of flat-lying\r\nsandstones. Locally the sandstones contain as much as 20 per cent of the\r\nroscoelite. The deposits contain small amounts of fossil wood which may\r\nhave been an agent in the precipitation of the vanadium. There is\r\nconsiderable doubt as to their origin, but it is generally supposed that\r\nthey represent concentrations by surface waters of minute quantities of\r\nmaterial originally scattered through the surrounding sediments; it has\r\nalso been suggested that certain igneous dikes in this region may have\r\nhad some connection with the mineralization. Deposits of carnotite, a\r\npotassium-uranium vanadate, which have been worked for their content of\r\nuranium and radium and from which vanadium has been obtained as a\r\nby-product, are found as impregnations of the sandstone in these same\r\nlocalities (p. 265).\r\n\r\nThere are other deposits containing small amounts of vanadium which are\r\nnot at present available as ores. Vanadinite, a lead-vanadate, and\r\ndescloizite, a vanadate of copper or lead, are found in the oxide zones\r\nof a number of lead and copper deposits in the southwestern United\r\nStates and Mexico. Titaniferous iron ores, extensive deposits of which\r\nare known in many places, usually contain a small percentage of\r\nvanadium.\r\n\r\nOutside of the Peruvian deposit, the affiliations of which are doubtful,\r\nthe vanadium deposits of economic importance owe their positions and\r\nvalues mainly to the action of surface processes, rather than to igneous\r\nactivity.\r\n\r\n\r\nZIRCONIUM ORES\r\n\r\n\r\nECONOMIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nThe oxides of zirconium have high refractory properties which make them\r\nuseful for refractory bricks and shapes for furnace linings, for\r\nchemical ware, and for other heat, acid, and alkali resisting articles.\r\nFor these purposes they find a limited market. Experimental work seems\r\nto show possibilities of a very considerable use of zirconium as a steel\r\nalloy; indeed, results are so suggestive that during the war the\r\ngovernment conducted an active campaign of investigation with a view to\r\nusing it in ordnance and armor steel. For such purposes the alloy\r\nferrozirconium is used, which carries 25 to 35 per cent zirconium metal.\r\n\r\nThe principal known deposits of zirconium ores, in order of commercial\r\nimportance, are in Brazil, in India, and in the United States (Pablo\r\nBeach, Florida). The Brazilian and Indian deposits are also the\r\nprincipal sources of monazite (pp. 288-289). The United States controls\r\none of the important Brazilian deposits. Germany before the war\r\ncontrolled the Indian deposits, and is reported to have taken much\r\ninterest in the development of zirconium steels. During the war German\r\ninfluence in India was effectively broken up. The use of zirconium has\r\nbeen in an experimental state, and known sources of supply have been\r\nample for all requirements.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nThe zirconium silicate, zircon, is a fairly common accessory constituent\r\nof granitic rocks and pegmatite veins. From these rocks it is separated\r\nby weathering, disintegration, and stream transportation, and, having a\r\nhigh specific gravity, it becomes concentrated in placers. The deposits\r\nof southern India, of the coast of Brazil, and of Pablo Beach, Florida,\r\nall contain zircon along with ilmenite, garnet, rutile, monazite, and\r\nother insoluble, heavy minerals, in the sands of the ocean beaches.\r\nSmaller deposits of zircon-bearing sands exist in rivers and beaches in\r\nother parts of the United States and in other countries, but none of\r\nthese deposits has thus far proved to be of commercial importance.\r\n\r\nThe largest and most important zirconium deposits are on a mountainous\r\nplateau in eastern Brazil and are of a unique type, entirely different\r\nfrom those just described. They contain the natural zirconium oxide,\r\nbaddeleyite or brazilite, mixed with the silicate, the ore as produced\r\ncarrying about 80 per cent zirconia (ZrO_{2}). The ores consist both of\r\nalluvial pebbles and of extensive deposits in place. The latter are\r\nassociated with phonolite (igneous) rocks, and seem to owe their origin\r\nto the agency of hot mineralizing solutions from the igneous rocks.\r\n\r\n\r\nTITANIUM ORES\r\n\r\n\r\nECONOMIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nTitanium is sometimes used in steel manufacture to take out occluded\r\ngases and thus to increase the strength and wearing qualities. Its\r\neffect is to cure certain evils in the hardening of the molten steel,\r\nand it is not ordinarily added in amounts sufficient to form a definite\r\nsteel alloy. Aluminum is frequently used in place of titanium. Titanium\r\nis added in the form of ferrotitanium, containing either about 15 per\r\ncent titanium and 6 to 8 per cent carbon, or about 25 per cent titanium\r\nand no carbon. Titanium compounds are also used in pigments, as\r\nelectrodes for arc-lights, and by the army and navy for making\r\nsmoke-clouds.\r\n\r\nThe United States has domestic supplies of titanium sufficient for all\r\nrequirements. Production has come chiefly from Virginia. Additional\r\nquantities have been imported from Canada and Norway. The recently\r\ndeveloped deposits of Pablo Beach, Florida, may produce important\r\namounts of titanium minerals along with the output of zircon and\r\nmonazite.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nThe principal titanium minerals are rutile (titanium oxide) and ilmenite\r\n(iron titanate). These minerals are formed mainly under high\r\ntemperatures, either during the original solidification of igneous\r\nrocks, or as constituents of the pegmatites which follow the\r\ncrystallization of the main igneous masses. The Virginia production\r\ncomes from pegmatite dikes cutting through gabbros, syenites, and\r\ngneisses. The deposits contain rutile in amounts as high as 30 per cent\r\nof the mass, but averaging 4 or 5 per cent, in addition to varying\r\namounts of ilmenite. Titaniferous magnetites, formed in many basic\r\nigneous rocks by the segregation of certain iron-bearing materials into\r\nirregular masses, contain large quantities of ilmenite which are not\r\ncommercially available under present metallurgical processes.\r\n\r\nRutile and ilmenite both have high specific gravity and are little\r\naffected by weathering. Consequently they are not decomposed at the\r\nsurface, but when carried away and subjected to the sorting action of\r\nstreams and waves, they form placer deposits. Both of these minerals are\r\nrecovered from the sands at Pablo Beach, Florida.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAGNESITE\r\n\r\n\r\nECONOMIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nThe most important use of magnesite is as a refractory material for\r\nlining furnaces and converters. It is also used in the manufacture of\r\nSorel cement for stucco and flooring, in making paper, in fire-resisting\r\npaint, in heat insulation, and as a source for carbon dioxide. Small\r\namounts are used in Epsom salts and other chemicals.\r\n\r\nAs taken from the ground the ore consists principally of the mineral\r\nmagnesite or magnesium carbonate, with minor impurities (1 to 12 per\r\ncent) of lime, iron, silica, and alumina. In making magnesite bricks, it\r\nis calcined or \"dead-burned\" to drive out the carbon dioxide.\r\n\r\nAustria-Hungary and Greece are the large European producers of magnesite\r\nand Scotland supplies a little. Most of the European production is\r\nconsumed in England and the Central European countries, but part has\r\nbeen sent to America. Outside the United States there are American\r\nsupplies in Canada, and recent developments in Venezuela and Mexico\r\n(Lower California).\r\n\r\nMagnesite is produced in considerable quantities in the United States,\r\nin California and Washington. Some material is imported from Canada, and\r\na small amount comes from Scotland as return cargo for ballast purposes.\r\n\r\nBefore the war only about 5 per cent of the United States requirements\r\nof magnesite were met by domestic production. The country was\r\npractically dependent on imports from various European countries;\r\nchiefly from Austria-Hungary and Greece The Austrian magnesite\r\n(controlled in large part by American capital) was considered especially\r\ndesirable for lining open-hearth steel furnaces, because of the presence\r\nof a small percentage of iron which made the material slightly more\r\nfusible than the pure mineral. When the shipments from this source were\r\ndiscontinued during the war and prices rose to a high figure,\r\nexperiments were made with American magnesite, and the deposits on the\r\nPacific Coast were developed on a large scale. A process of treatment\r\nwas perfected by which the Washington magnesite was made as desirable\r\nfor lining furnaces as the Austrian material. At the same time large\r\namounts were imported from Canada and Venezuela and lesser amounts from\r\nLower California.\r\n\r\nUnder the high prices which prevailed during the war, dolomite was to\r\nsome extent substituted for magnesite. Dolomite, which may be thought of\r\nas a magnesite rock high in lime, occurs in large quantities close to\r\nmany points of consumption. It is cheaper but less satisfactory than\r\nmagnesite, and is not likely to be used on any large scale.\r\n\r\nWhile the United States has undoubtedly sufficient reserves of magnesite\r\nto supply the domestic demands for many years, the mines are far from\r\nthe centers of consumption and it is expensive to transport the\r\nmaterial. Since the war, magnesite shipped from Canada and overseas has\r\nagain replaced the American product in the eastern market to some\r\nextent. The Canadian magnesite is of lower grade than the domestic and\r\nEuropean magnesite and is consequently less desirable. Deposits in\r\nVenezuela are also expected to furnish some material for the eastern\r\nfurnaces, in competition with those of Austria and Greece. Austrian\r\nmagnesite, however, will be likely to dominate the market in the future\r\nif delivered at anything like pre-war prices. This situation has led to\r\nagitation for a protective tariff on magnesite.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nMagnesite, as noted above, is the name of a mineral, the composition of\r\nwhich is magnesium carbonate. The principal magnesite deposits are of\r\ntwo types, of different modes of origin and of somewhat different\r\nphysical characteristics.\r\n\r\nThe large magnesite deposits of Austria and of Washington, as well as\r\nthose of Quebec, occur as lenses in beds of dolomite (calcium-magnesium\r\ncarbonate). They are in fairly close proximity to igneous rocks, and\r\nmagnesia-bearing solutions issuing from these rocks are believed to have\r\ndissolved out the calcium carbonate of the dolomite and replaced it with\r\nmagnesium carbonate. In these deposits the material is coarsely\r\ncrystalline and forms fairly large, continuous bodies, which are worked\r\nby quarrying. The Washington deposits closely resemble marble, and had\r\nsometimes been mistaken for that rock until war-time needs resulted in\r\ntheir more thorough investigation.\r\n\r\nThe commoner type of magnesite deposits is represented by those of\r\nGreece, California, Venezuela, and many other countries. These consist\r\nof veins and replacements in serpentine. The original rock was a highly\r\nmagnesian igneous rock of the peridotite type, which is very unstable\r\nunder weathering conditions, and rapidly alters to serpentine. Magnesite\r\nis formed both by this process and by the further breaking down of the\r\nserpentine itself. The processes are those of katamorphism. Under these\r\ncircumstances the magnesite is characteristically fine-grained or\r\nmassive, and occurs in veins, lenses, and irregular bodies in cavities\r\nand fractured zones. It is usually worked by open cuts.\r\n\r\nMagnesite is also reported to occur in sedimentary beds in which it was\r\nprimarily deposited in its present form and has not undergone later\r\nalteration. Such deposits are not important commercially.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLUORSPAR\r\n\r\n\r\nECONOMIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nThe chief use of fluorspar is as a flux in the manufacture of\r\nopen-hearth steel. Minor uses are in chemical and enameling industries,\r\nin the smelting of copper, lead, and iron, and in the manufacture of the\r\nferro-alloys in the electric furnace.\r\n\r\nIn order to be used in steel-making, the fluorspar after being\r\nconcentrated should contain at least 85 per cent calcium fluoride and\r\nless than 4 per cent silica. Chemical and enameling industries require\r\nmaterial with 95 to 98 per cent calcium fluoride and less than 1 per\r\ncent silica.\r\n\r\nThe chief foreign producer of fluorspar is Great Britain, and much of\r\nthis product comes to the United States. Canada produces a small\r\namount, some of which also comes to the United States. Several thousand\r\ntons are produced yearly in Germany and France, and are largely consumed\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nThe production of fluorspar in the United States is several times that\r\nof any other country. The ore mined comes principally from the southern\r\nIllinois and western Kentucky field, and is used largely for fluxing\r\npurposes in open-hearth steel furnaces. Minor amounts are produced in\r\nColorado, New Mexico, and other states.\r\n\r\nThe United States has sufficient supplies of fluorspar to meet all its\r\nown demands for this material. Small amounts, however, are imported for\r\nuse in eastern furnaces because the material can be brought over from\r\nEngland very cheaply. The domestic fluorspar is suitable for practically\r\nall purposes for which fluorspar is used except for lenses in optical\r\ninstruments. For this use very small quantities of material imported\r\nfrom Japan have been used, but recently fluorspar of a grade suitable\r\nfor optical purposes has been found in Illinois, Kentucky, New\r\nHampshire, and other states. For fluxing purposes domestic fluorspar is\r\nsuperior to the foreign product.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nFluorspar is the trade name for the mineral fluorite, which is composed\r\nof calcium fluoride. This is a common mineral in veins and replacements\r\nwhich carry ores of zinc, lead, silver, gold, copper, and tin. It is\r\nformed under a variety of conditions, but is always ascribed to\r\nsolutions coming from nearby igneous rocks.\r\n\r\nThe large fluorspar deposits of Illinois and Kentucky contain fluorite\r\nwith calcite, barite, and metallic sulphides, in wide veins filling\r\nfissures in limestones and sandstones and replacing the fissure walls.\r\nInto these sediments there are intruded certain peridotite dikes. The\r\nfluorite and associated minerals were probably deposited by hot\r\nsolutions bringing the material from some large underlying igneous mass\r\nof which the dikes are off-shoots.\r\n\r\nIn the western United States many metalliferous deposits carry large\r\namounts of fluorite, which is treated as a gangue or waste mineral, but\r\nwhich could be profitably extracted if there were local markets. In\r\nEngland, fluorite is obtained in this manner as a by-product from lead\r\nand zinc mines.\r\n\r\n\r\nSILICA\r\n\r\n\r\nECONOMIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nSilicon and its oxide, silica, find important applications in the\r\nmanufacture of iron and steel. Silicon, like manganese, is an important\r\nconstituent of many steels, the alloy ferrosilicon being added to\r\ndeoxidize and purify the metal and thus to increase its tensile\r\nstrength. Like titanium, it is added chiefly for its curative effect\r\nrather than as a useful ingredient. On an average 4 pounds of 50 to 55\r\nper cent ferrosilicon are used in the United States for each ton of\r\nsteel produced. A higher grade of ferrosilicon (80 to 85 per cent) is\r\nused for certain special steels, and during the war considerable\r\nquantities were used in making hydrogen gas for balloons. Lower grades\r\n(10 to 15 per cent silicon) are practically a high silicon pig iron.\r\n\r\nSilica has an important use in the form of silica brick or \"ganister\"\r\nfor lining furnaces and converters in which acid slags are formed. For\r\nthis purpose siliceous rocks, chiefly quartzites and sandstones, are\r\nground up, mixed with lime as a binder, and fused and pressed into\r\nbricks and shapes. For the most satisfactory results the rock should\r\ncontain 96 per cent or more of silica, and very little of the alkali\r\nmaterials, which increase the fusibility.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its applications to the iron and steel industry, silica\r\nfinds an almost universal use in a wide variety of structural and\r\nmanufacturing operations. The extensive use of sand and gravel--composed\r\nchiefly of silica--for road materials and railway ballast is well known.\r\nIn construction work silica is used in the form of stone, sand-lime\r\nbrick, cement, mortar, concrete, etc. Large quantities of sand, or\r\nsilica, are used for molds in foundries, for abrasives, for the\r\nmanufacture of glass, for filters, and for a great variety of other\r\npurposes which readily suggest themselves (see pp. 84, 267).\r\n\r\nFor most uses of silica there are local supplies available. For certain\r\npurposes requiring material of a particular chemical composition or\r\ntexture, however, satisfactory deposits are known in only a few places.\r\nFor example, the material for silica refractories is obtained in the\r\nUnited States chiefly from certain regions in Pennsylvania, Missouri,\r\nand Wisconsin. The United States has ample domestic supplies of silica\r\nfor practically all requirements.\r\n\r\nFerrosilicon of the higher grades is manufactured principally in\r\nelectric furnaces at Niagara Falls. The capacity is ample to meet all\r\ndemands, but cheap ferrosilicon from Canada also enters United States\r\nmarkets.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nSilicon and oxygen, making up the compound silica, are the two most\r\nabundant elements in the earth's crust, and quartz (SiO_2) is a very\r\nabundant mineral. The processes of weathering and transportation\r\neverywhere operative on the surface of the earth tend to separate quartz\r\nfrom other materials, and to concentrate it into deposits of sand.\r\nKatamorphism is primarily responsible for most of the deposits of silica\r\nwhich are commercially used. Anamorphism--cementing and hardening the\r\nsands into sandstones and quartzites--has created additional value for\r\ncertain uses, as in refractories, building stones, and abrasives (see\r\npp. 84, 267).\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[31] Report of the Royal Ontario Nickel Commission.

The\r\nmanufacture of brass, bronze, and other copper alloys constitutes\r\nanother chief use for the metal. Considerable quantities of copper\r\nsheets, tubes, and other wares are used outside of the electrical\r\nindustry, as for instance in roofing, plumbing, and ship bottoms. Copper\r\nis also used in coinage, particularly in China, where it is the money\r\nstandard of the working population.\r\n\r\nThe average grade of all copper ores mined in the United States in\r\nrecent years has been about 1.7 per cent metallic copper. Ores\r\ncontaining as low as 0.6 per cent have been mined in the Lake Superior\r\ncountry, and bonanza deposits containing 20 to 60 per cent have been\r\nfound and worked in some places, notably in Alaska and Wyoming. The\r\nlower-grade ores, carrying 1 to 3 per cent copper, are usually\r\nconcentrated before smelting, while the richer ores, carrying 3 to 5 per\r\ncent or more, are generally smelted direct. Many of the ores contain\r\nvalues in gold and silver, and also in lead and zinc. An average of\r\nabout 40c. worth of gold and silver per ton is obtained from all the\r\ncopper ores of the United States.\r\n\r\nIn other countries the average grade of copper ores mined is somewhat\r\nhigher than in the United States,--where large scale operations,\r\nparticularly the use of steam-shovel methods on extensive bodies of\r\ndisseminated or \"porphyry\" copper ores, as well as improvements in\r\nconcentrating and metallurgical processes, have made possible the use of\r\nlow-grade ore.\r\n\r\nThe principal sources of copper are the North American continent, Chile\r\nand Peru, Japan, south and central Africa, Australia, and Spain and\r\nPortugal. Smaller quantities are produced in Russia, Germany, Norway,\r\nCuba, Serbia, and a number of other countries.\r\n\r\nThe United States normally produces nearly two-thirds of the world's\r\ncopper and consumes only about one-third. In addition the great bulk of\r\nthe South American, Mexican, and Canadian crude copper comes to the\r\nUnited States for refining. Through financial interests abroad and by\r\nmeans of refining facilities, the United States controls a quantity of\r\nforeign production which, together with the domestic production, gives\r\nit control of about 70 per cent of the world's copper. No other country\r\nproduces one-sixth as much copper as the United States.\r\n\r\nEngland, because of production in the British Empire (mainly Africa and\r\nAustralia) and British financial control of production in various\r\nforeign countries, is not dependent upon the United States for supplies\r\nof raw copper. Japan, Spain, Portugal, and Norway are able to produce\r\nfrom local mines enough copper for their own needs and for export. But\r\nFrance, Italy, Russia, Germany, and the rest of Europe normally are\r\ndependent upon foreign sources, chiefly the United States. South\r\nAmerica, Mexico, Canada, Africa, and Australia are exporters of copper.\r\nThe control of these countries over their production in each case is\r\npolitical and not financial, except in the case of Canada, where about\r\nhalf the financial control is also Canadian. It is in these countries\r\nand in Spain that the United States and England have financial control\r\nof a large copper supply.\r\n\r\nBefore the war German interests had a considerable control over the\r\nAmerican copper industry through close working arrangements with\r\nelectrolytic refineries. Germany was the largest foreign consumer of\r\ncopper, and German companies bought large quantities of the raw copper\r\nin the United States, Canada, Mexico, and South America, had it refined,\r\nand sold the finished material in both the American and foreign markets.\r\nDuring the war this control was broken up.\r\n\r\nIn view of the importance of copper metal as a raw material,\r\nparticularly in the electrical industry, the strength of the United\r\nStates in copper as a key resource ranks even above its control of\r\npetroleum.\r\n\r\nIn the United States in recent years about 40 per cent of the annual\r\nproduction of copper has come from Arizona, chiefly from the Bisbee,\r\nGlobe, Ray-Miami, Jerome, and Morenci-Metcalf districts; about 18 per\r\ncent has come from the Butte district of Montana; about 12 to 15 per\r\ncent from Keweenaw Point, Michigan; and about 12 per cent from Bingham,\r\nUtah. From 3 to 5 per cent of the country's output comes from each of\r\nthe states of New Mexico, Nevada, Alaska, and California. All other\r\nstates together produce only a little over 2 per cent of the total.\r\n\r\nThe so-called \"porphyry\" coppers in Utah, Arizona, Nevada, and New\r\nMexico, described below, are the source of about 35 per cent of the\r\npresent production of the United States. The deep mines of Butte and\r\nMichigan are responsible for about 30 per cent of the production, and\r\nthe ore bodies of Arizona (other than porphyry) and of Alaska produce\r\nabout 25 per cent.\r\n\r\nReserves of copper ore are such as to give no immediate concern about\r\nshortage, nor to indicate any large shift in the distribution of\r\nproduction in the near future. Development is on the whole considerably\r\nin advance of present demands. The principal measured reserves are in\r\nthe so-called porphyry coppers of the United States and Chile. In the\r\nUnited States the life of these reserves now estimated is approximately\r\n25 years. The reserves of the Chile Copper Company are the largest of\r\nany known copper deposit in the world, and the Braden copper reserve\r\n(also in Chile) is among the largest. For the deep mines of the United\r\nStates, the developed reserves have a life of perhaps only five years,\r\nbut for most of these mines the life will be greatly extended by further\r\nand deeper development. The porphyry coppers, because of their\r\noccurrence near the surface and the ease with which they may be explored\r\nby drilling, disclose their reserves far in advance. The deep mines are\r\nordinarily developed for only a few years in advance of production.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nThe principal copper minerals may be classified into the sulphide group,\r\nthe oxide group, and native copper. Native copper, mined in the Lake\r\nSuperior region, is the source of 8 to 10 per cent of the world's copper\r\nsupply. The oxide group of minerals--including the copper carbonates,\r\nazurite and malachite; the silicate, chrysocolla; the oxide, cuprite;\r\nthe sulphates, chalcanthite and brochantite; and some native copper\r\nassociated with these minerals--probably supplies another 5 per cent.\r\nThe remaining 85 per cent is derived from the sulphide group. Of the\r\nsulphide group by far the most important mineral is chalcocite (cuprous\r\nsulphide), which supplies the bulk of the values in the majority of the\r\nmining camps of the western hemisphere. Locally, as at Butte, enargite\r\n(copper-arsenic sulphide) is of great value. Other minerals of\r\nconsiderable importance in some districts are chalcopyrite and bornite\r\n(copper-iron sulphides), tetrahedrite (copper-antimony sulphide), and\r\ncovellite (cupric sulphide). Very commonly the copper sulphides are\r\nassociated with large quantities of the iron sulphide, pyrite, as well\r\nas with varying amounts of lead and zinc sulphides and gold and silver\r\nminerals.\r\n\r\nThe principal copper ores originate in the earlier stages of the\r\nmetamorphic cycle, in close association with igneous activity.\r\nKatamorphism or weathering, in place, has played an important part in\r\nenriching them. The processes of transportation and sedimentary\r\ndeposition, which have done so much toward making valuable iron ore\r\ndeposits, have contributed little to the formation of copper ores.\r\n\r\n=Copper deposits associated with igneous flows.= The copper ores of the\r\nLake Superior district, and of a few small deposits in the eastern\r\nUnited States, contain small percentages of native copper in\r\npre-Cambrian volcanic flows or in sediments between the flows. The ore\r\nbodies have the form of long sheets parallel to the bedding, the copper\r\nand associated minerals filling amygdaloidal openings and small fissures\r\nin the flows, and replacing conglomeratic sediments which lie between\r\nthe flows. The copper was probably deposited by hot solutions related to\r\nthe igneous rocks, either issuing from the magmas or deriving heat and\r\ndissolved material from them. Secondary concentration has not been\r\nimportant. There is practically none of it near the present erosion\r\nsurface; but it appears in one part of the district near an older\r\nerosion surface covered by Cambrian sediments, suggesting a different\r\nclimatic condition at that time.\r\n\r\nThe Kennecott copper deposits of Alaska have a number of resemblances to\r\nthe Lake Superior copper deposits, suggesting similarity in origin. The\r\nKennecott deposits occur exclusively in limestone, which rests\r\nconformably on a tilted surface of igneous flows (\"greenstones\") not\r\nunlike those of Lake Superior. The flows carry native copper and copper\r\nsulphides in minutely disseminated form and in amygdules, but apparently\r\nnot in quantities sufficiently concentrated to mine. The flows are\r\nsupposed to be the original source of the copper now in the limestone.\r\nThe primary copper mineral in the limestone is chalcocite, in\r\nexceptionally rich and solid masses, showing no evidence of having\r\nreplaced earlier sulphides. It is regarded as a product of primary\r\ndeposition, under the influence of hot solutions related in some way to\r\nthe igneous flows; but whether the solutions were magmatic, originating\r\nin the lavas or below, or whether they were meteoric waters rendered hot\r\nby contact with the extrusives, and thereby made effective in leaching\r\ncopper from them, is not clear. The oxidation of the Kennecott copper\r\nores is not extensive. It presents an interesting feature, in that since\r\nglacial time the ground has been frozen and the moisture is now present\r\nin the form of ice. The oxidation clearly took place before glacial\r\ntime. Abundant fragments of both the oxide and the sulphide ores are\r\nmined from the lateral moraine of a nearby glacier. This is a good\r\nillustration of the cyclic nature of secondary concentration which is\r\ncoming to be recognized in so many camps.\r\n\r\nThe Boleo copper deposits of Lower California occur in volcanic tuffs\r\nand associated conglomerates of Tertiary age. They have certain peculiar\r\nmineralogic associations--the ores containing large quantities of all\r\nthe common copper oxide minerals, and a number of rare oxide minerals of\r\ncopper, lead, silver, and cobalt, together with gypsum, sulphur, and\r\nmuch iron and manganese oxide. The copper oxides and carbonates are in\r\nplaces gathered into rounded concretions called \"boleos\" (balls).\r\nSulphides are present in the lowest beds and may represent the form in\r\nwhich the copper was originally deposited. The copper-bearing beds have\r\nbeen much silicified, and it has been suggested that mineralization was\r\naccomplished by hot-spring waters, probably of igneous origin. These\r\ndeposits have a few marked similarities to the Lake Superior copper\r\nores.\r\n\r\n=Copper veins in igneous rocks.= A second group of copper ores in\r\nigneous rocks is made up of deposits in distinct fissure veins and as\r\nreplacements along such veins. The chief deposits of this type are at\r\nButte, Montana--which is, from the standpoint of both past and present\r\nproduction, the greatest single copper district in the world. Here a\r\nlarge batholith of Tertiary granite was intruded by porphyry dikes; and\r\nfaulting, accompanying and following the intrusions of the dikes,\r\ndeveloped numerous fissures. The fissures were mineralized with copper\r\nsulphides and arsenides, iron sulphides, and locally with zinc sulphide\r\nand manganese carbonate,--all in a matrix of quartz. At the same time\r\nthe wall rocks were extensively mineralized and altered; the fissure\r\nveins grade off into the wall rock, and in fact the larger part of the\r\nore is simply altered granite with disseminated sulphides. The solutions\r\nwhich deposited the ores are inferred to have been hot from the nature\r\nof the wall-rock alterations, from the presence of hot-water minerals\r\nlike fluorite, cassiterite, and others, and from the general association\r\nof the ores in time and place with the porphyry intrusions. The\r\nsolutions are believed to have originated from the porphyry and possibly\r\nfrom other intrusives.\r\n\r\nIn the Butte district, and in the great majority of copper sulphide vein\r\nores throughout the world, secondary concentration by surface waters has\r\nplayed a considerable part in developing ores of commercial value. Near\r\nthe surface the copper is leached out and carried down by waters\r\ncontaining various solvents, particularly sulphuric acid from the\r\noxidation of pyrite. A leached zone is formed containing the ordinary\r\nproducts of rock weathering,--rusty quartz and clay, sometimes black\r\nwith manganese oxides. A small part of the copper remains in this zone\r\nas oxides, carbonates, and silicates. Below the oxidized and leached\r\nzone there is evidence of deposition of a large amount of secondary\r\ncopper sulphide in the form of chalcocite. This is supposed to have been\r\nformed by the leaching of copper from above as soluble copper sulphate,\r\nand its precipitation below by iron and other sulphide minerals which\r\nthe solutions meet on their downward course--a reaction which has been\r\ndemonstrated experimentally. It was formerly supposed that most of the\r\nchalcocite was of this origin; but as chalcocite is found in important\r\namounts with enargite and chalcopyrite to great depths (now 3,500 feet),\r\nwhere the veins are still rich and strong, it begins to appear that much\r\nof the chalcocite is of primary origin.\r\n\r\nThe fissures along which the Butte ores occur are in three main sets,\r\nwhich in order of age strike roughly east-west, northwest-southeast, and\r\nnortheast-southwest. Two-thirds of the ore is in the first set, about 30\r\nper cent in the second, and the remainder in the third. The\r\nmineralization of the several vein systems cannot be discriminated, and\r\nit is thought that it was accomplished as a more or less continuous and\r\nprogressive process. There is some evidence, also, that the fracturing\r\nin the several fracture systems was likewise a nearly continuous\r\nprogressive process, contemporaneous with the ore deposition, and\r\nperhaps developing under a single great shear which caused more or less\r\nsimultaneous and overlapping systems of fractures in the various\r\ndirections.\r\n\r\n=\"Porphyry coppers.\"= Another type of copper deposits in igneous rocks\r\nis the disseminated or \"porphyry\" deposits. The term \"porphyry\" as\r\ncommonly used includes true porphyries, monzonites, granites, and other\r\nigneous rocks. Ores of this type are represented by the great deposits\r\nof Bingham, Utah; Ray, Miami, and the New Cornelia mine of Arizona; Ely,\r\nNevada; Santa Rita, New Mexico; Cananea, Sonora, Mexico; northern Chile;\r\nand many other districts of importance. They form the greatest known\r\nreserves of copper ore. These deposits contain copper minerals, usually\r\nin the marginal portions of acid porphyries, in many irregular, closely\r\nspaced veins, and in minute seams and spots disseminated through the\r\nmass of the rock. In the Ray and Miami and other districts the\r\nmineralization has spread largely through adjacent schists, but these\r\ndeposits are included with the porphyry copper deposits in commercial\r\nparlance. The porphyry deposits are of an undulating blanket form of\r\nconsiderable areal extent and shallow depth. At the surface is a leached\r\nand weathered zone, often containing more or less of the oxides,\r\ncarbonates, and silicates of copper, ranging in thickness up to 1,000\r\nfeet, but averaging 200 feet or less. Below this is a zone carrying\r\ncopper in the form of chalcopyrite, enriched by chalcocite deposition\r\nfrom above, ranging in thickness up to 400 feet. The ore in this zone\r\nvaries from one-half of 1 per cent to 6 per cent of copper and\r\nordinarily averages between 1 and 2 per cent. The use of ore of this\r\ngrade is made possible by the large quantities and by the cheap and\r\nefficient mining and metallurgical practices. The ore body grades below\r\ninto a zone characterized by lean chalcopyrite, which is supposed to\r\nrepresent original or primary deposition from hot waters associated with\r\nthe porphyry intrusion. This primary ore, or protore, was clearly formed\r\nafter the solidification of the igneous rocks, though soon after, by\r\nsolutions from igneous sources which followed fractured and shattered\r\nzones.\r\n\r\n=Copper in limestone near igneous contacts.= Another great group of\r\ncopper deposits occurs as replacements of limestone adjacent to porphyry\r\nor granitic intrusives. This type is illustrated by some of the deposits\r\nat Bingham, Utah, and at Bisbee, Arizona. The primary deposition was of\r\nchalcopyrite and other copper sulphides, together with garnet, diopside,\r\nand other minerals known to have required high temperature in their\r\nformation. The ore fills fissures and replaces extensive masses of the\r\nlimestone. It is likely to show a fairly sharp contact on the side\r\ntoward the intrusive, and to grade off into the country rock on the\r\nother side with numerous embayments and irregularities. These deposits\r\nhave been enriched by weathering in the same manner as indicated above\r\nfor the porphyry coppers, but to highly varying degrees. In the Bisbee\r\ndeposits large values were found in the weathered zone, and secondary\r\nsulphide enrichment below this zone is also important. In the Bingham\r\ncamp, on the other hand, the weathered zone is insignificant and most of\r\nthe ore beneath is primary. The weathering of the silicated limestone\r\ngangue results in great masses of clay which are characteristic features\r\nof the oxide zones of these deposits.\r\n\r\n=Copper deposits in schists.= Other copper deposits, as at Jerome,\r\nArizona, in the Foothill and Shasta County districts of California, at\r\nDucktown, Tennessee, etc., are irregular lenticular bodies in schists\r\nand other rocks, but all show relationship to igneous rocks. The Rio\r\nTinto ores of Spain and Portugal, which belong in this group, have been\r\nreferred to on page 108.\r\n\r\nIn the Jerome or Verde district of central Arizona, folded pre-Cambrian\r\ngreenstones and sediments were invaded by masses of quartz-porphyry, and\r\nafter further deformation, rendering many of the rocks schistose, were\r\nintruded by an augite-diorite. Contact metamorphism along both the\r\nquartz-porphyry and the diorite contacts was practically lacking. The\r\nore bodies were formed as irregular pipe-like replacements of the\r\nschists, being localized in one case by a steeply pitching inverted\r\ntrough of impervious diorite, and in other cases by shear zones which\r\nfavored vigorous circulation. A later series of small diorite or\r\nandesite dikes cut the ore bodies. The primary ores consist of pyrite,\r\nchalcopyrite, and other sulphides, with large amounts of jaspery quartz\r\nand some calcite and dolomite. They were clearly formed by replacement\r\nof the schists particle by particle, as shown by the frequent\r\npreservation of the schist structure in a banding of the sulphide\r\nminerals, the residual shreds of unreplaced schist material in the ores,\r\nand the usual gradual transition from unreplaced schists to those\r\ncompletely replaced by massive sulphides. The localization of the most\r\nimportant mineralization in an inverted trough is good evidence that the\r\nsolutions came from below, and the nature of the mineral associations\r\nsuggests an origin through the work of hot waters associated with\r\nigneous intrusives. The diorite, being most closely related in time and\r\nspace with the ore bodies, seems the most logical source of the ore\r\nmaterials.\r\n\r\nSecondary concentration of the Jerome ores has proceeded along the\r\ngeneral lines previously outlined (pp. 46-50, 202). Here again the\r\nevidence is clear that the ores were concentrated in an earlier period,\r\nin this case in pre-Cambrian times, probably during the long interval\r\nrequired for the base-leveling of the pre-Cambrian mountains. Since\r\nCambrian times the deposits have been for the most part buried by later\r\nsediments. Some of the deposits are still protected by this overlying\r\nblanket and mining has not yet reached the zone of altogether primary\r\nsulphides. Others have been faulted up and again exposed by erosion; but\r\nsince being uncovered, steep slopes and rapid erosion have apparently\r\nfavored the scattering of the copper rather than its concentration and\r\nenrichment. In the United Verde Mine, oxidizing conditions at present\r\nprevail to the bottom of the chalcocite zone.\r\n\r\nThe very large reserves of the Katanga copper belt of the Belgian Congo\r\nare in the form of tabular masses in schistose and highly metamorphosed\r\nPaleozoic sediments. The ore bodies are roughly parallel to the bedding,\r\nbut in instances follow the schistosity which cuts across the bedding.\r\nThey consist dominantly of the oxide minerals, though in several ore\r\nbodies sulphides have been shown by diamond-drilling. The ores have a\r\nhigh content of cobalt and also carry precious metals. The origin of the\r\ndeposits is not known, but has been ascribed to granitic masses\r\nintrusive into the schists.\r\n\r\n=Sedimentary copper deposits.= In the later phases of the metamorphic\r\ncycle, the agencies of transportation (in solution) and sedimentary\r\ndeposition have resulted in some low-grade deposits of copper sulphides\r\nin sedimentary rocks. Deposits of this type are found in the Rocky\r\nMountain region, where they are referred to as the \"Red Beds\" coppers,\r\nbut are of no commercial importance. Similar deposits in Germany, the\r\nMansfield copper-bearing shales, have been worked for some time, and\r\nduring the war were Germany's main source of copper. On Keweenaw Point,\r\nMichigan, deposits of native copper formed in this manner in the\r\n\"Nonesuch\" beds have been worked on a commercial scale. Other copper\r\nores on Keweenaw Point are replacements of conglomerate beds between\r\nigneous flows, and are of a different origin already described (p. 200).\r\n\r\nWhile much of the copper of sedimentary beds gives evidence that it was\r\ndeposited from solution in cracks and as replacements of the wall rocks,\r\noften through the agency of abundant organic material in the beds, and\r\nwhile also comparatively little of this copper can be identified as\r\nhaving been deposited in detrital flakes or fragments along with the\r\nother mineral fragments, there is, nevertheless, considerable evidence\r\nthat some of these deposits were formed essentially during the\r\nsedimentation of the enclosing beds and as incidents to this process.\r\nSuch evidence consists of a close limitation of the copper to certain\r\nbeds, its wide and uniform distribution within these beds, its absence\r\nin similar beds near at hand, the absence of evidence of feeding and\r\nescape channels of the kind which would be necessary in case the\r\nsolutions were introduced long afterward, and often a minute\r\nparticipation of the copper minerals in the minor structures of bedding,\r\nfalse-bedding, and ripple-marks, which would be difficult to explain as\r\ndue to secondary concentration.\r\n\r\nThe Corocoro copper deposits of Bolivia occur in beds of sandstone with\r\nno igneous rocks in the vicinity. However, they are all closely\r\nassociated with a fault plane, igneous rocks occur at distances of a few\r\nmiles, and the general mineralization is coextensive with the belt of\r\nigneous rocks; the deposits are therefore ascribed to a magmatic source\r\nrather than to sedimentary processes. Toward the surface the copper is\r\nin part in the form of sulphides, somewhat altered to oxide minerals,\r\nand farther down it is entirely native copper, associated with gypsum.\r\nThis is the only district outside of Lake Superior where native copper\r\nhas been mined on an important scale.\r\n\r\n=General comments.= In general, the commercially prominent copper\r\ndeposits show a close relationship to igneous rocks in place, time, and\r\norigin. Seldom do the ores extend more than 1,000 feet away from the\r\nigneous rock.\r\n\r\nThe common downward order in sulphide deposits is: first, a weathered\r\nzone, originally formed mainly above the water table, consisting above\r\nof a leached portion and below of oxides and carbonates of copper in a\r\ngangue of quartz or clay; second, a zone of secondary sulphide\r\nenrichment, characterized by chalcocite coatings, chalcopyrite, and\r\npyrite, with a gangue of quartz and igneous rock or limestone; and\r\nthird, a zone of primary deposition with similar gangue, characterized\r\nby chalcopyrite, and at Butte by enargite and chalcocite. The oxide zone\r\nas a whole may be rich or lean in values, depending on the nature of the\r\nassociated gangue material and country rock. When these are more soluble\r\nthan the copper--as is commonly the case in limestone--the copper may be\r\nresidually concentrated, notwithstanding the fact that much copper\r\noriginally present has been carried off in solution. When the associated\r\ngangue and country rock are less soluble than the copper--as is common\r\nwith quartz and igneous rocks--the oxide zone is likely to be depleted\r\nof values.\r\n\r\nThe zones formed by weathering and secondary enrichment are extremely\r\nirregular, both in distribution and depth, in any one deposit, and they\r\noverlap and grade into one another in a very complex fashion. In many\r\nplaces the primary zone is too lean to be mined to commercial advantage;\r\nbut in other places, as at Butte, and in the limestone deposits of\r\nBingham, the primary ores are of considerable importance.\r\n\r\nWhen evidence of secondary sulphide enrichment was first recognized\r\nthere was a tendency to magnify its effectiveness, and to assume that in\r\nmost cases the values were due to this process; that the primary zones\r\nwould be found to be valueless. In recent years the emphasis is being\r\nsomewhat changed because of the recognizing in many camps of rich\r\nprimary zones. While some chalcocite is clearly the result of secondary\r\nenrichment from above, other chalcocite seems to have been related\r\nclosely to the primary deposition. The quantitative discrimination of\r\nthe two is a matter of great difficulty.\r\n\r\nIt has come to be recognized that the zonal arrangement caused by\r\nenrichment from the surface has been imposed usually on a zonal\r\narrangement caused by the primary hot solutions and not related to the\r\nsurface but to the source of the solutions. In some districts, as\r\nillustrated by Butte and Bingham, the copper-bearing minerals seem to\r\nhave been deposited nearest the igneous source, while the lead, zinc,\r\ngold, and silver minerals have been deposited farther away,--suggesting\r\nthe cooling of the solutions with increasing distance from the igneous\r\nsource. The further investigation of this primary zonal arrangement\r\npromises interesting results with a practical bearing on exploration and\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nOne of the newer features of the investigation of copper deposits has\r\nbeen the recognition of the cyclic nature of the secondary\r\nconcentration. This process has been related not only to the present\r\nerosion surface, but to older surfaces now partly buried under later\r\nrocks. Ransome's[33] summary of conditions at the Ray-Miami camp has a\r\nsomewhat general application.\r\n\r\n     Supergene enrichment has generally been treated as a\r\n     continuously progressive process. There is considerable\r\n     probability, however, that it is essentially cyclic, although\r\n     the cyclic character may not be patent in all deposits. A full\r\n     development of the cycle can take place only under a certain\r\n     equilibrium of a number of factors, including climate,\r\n     erosion, topography, and character of rock. The essential fact\r\n     appears to be that as enrichment progresses and chalcocite\r\n     increases the process of enrichment becomes slower in action,\r\n     and erosion may, in some circumstances, overtake it. With the\r\n     removal of some of the protecting zone of chalcocite the\r\n     protore is again exposed to oxidation and a second cycle of\r\n     enrichment begins.\r\n\r\n     Although much of the enriched ore is now below ground-water\r\n     level, it probably was once above that level, and enrichment\r\n     is believed to have taken place mainly in the zone of rock\r\n     above any general water table.\r\n\r\nWhere the old erosion surface roughly coincides with the present erosion\r\nsurface, the deposits follow more or less the topography. Where the old\r\nerosion surface pitches below later sediments, the ores pitch with it,\r\nand therefore do not follow the present topography. The recognition of\r\nthe cyclic nature of secondary concentration is obviously of great\r\nsignificance in exploration and development.\r\n\r\nAlthough a vast amount of study has been devoted to the origin and\r\nenrichment of copper deposits, and although the general conditions and\r\nprocesses are pretty well understood, the results thus far have been\r\nlargely qualitative rather than quantitative.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEAD ORES\r\n\r\n\r\nECONOMIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nThe most prominent uses of lead are in the manufacture of alloys, such\r\nas type-metal, bearing metal, shot, solder, and casting metal; as the\r\noxide, red lead, and the basic carbonate, white lead, in paints; for\r\nlead pipe, cable coverings, and containers of acid active material; and\r\nin lead compounds for various chemical and medical uses. Of the lead\r\nconsumed in the United States before the war about 38 per cent was\r\nutilized in pigments, 30 per cent in alloys other than shot, 15 per cent\r\nin pipe, 10 per cent in shot, and 7 per cent in all other uses. During\r\nthe war much larger quantities were used in munitions, such as shot and\r\nshrapnel.\r\n\r\nThe lead content of commercial ores varies widely. It ranges from as low\r\nas .25 per cent in the Joplin district of Missouri, to about 15 per cent\r\nin the Broken Hill deposits of Australia, and over 20 per cent in the\r\nBawdwin mines of Burma. In the Coeur d'Alene district of Idaho and the\r\nsoutheastern district of Missouri, the two greatest lead producers in\r\nthe United States, the average grades are about 10 per cent and about\r\n3-1/2 per cent respectively. The grade of ore which may be profitably\r\nworked depends not only upon the economic factors,--such as nearness to\r\nconsuming centers, and the price of lead,--but also upon the amenability\r\nof the ore to concentration, the content of other valuable metals, and\r\nthe fact that lead is very useful in smelting as a collector of gold and\r\nsilver.\r\n\r\nMost lead ores contain more or less zinc, and lead is obtained as a\r\nby-product of most zinc ores. Argentiferous lead ores form one of the\r\nprincipal sources of silver, and also yield some gold. Lead and copper\r\nare produced together from certain ores. Thus the separation of many\r\nores into hard and fast classes, as lead, or zinc, or copper, or silver,\r\nor gold ores, cannot be made; in some of the mineral resource reports of\r\nthe United States Geological Survey the statistics of these five metals\r\nare published together.\r\n\r\nThe main sources of lead ore, named in order of their importance, are\r\nthe United States, Australia, Spain, Germany, and Mexico, which account\r\nfor over 80 per cent of the world's production. Most of the countries of\r\nEurope outside of Spain and Germany produce small amounts of lead, but\r\nare largely dependent on imports. Spain exports argentiferous lead and\r\npig lead mainly to England and France, with minor quantities to other\r\ncountries of Europe and to Argentina. Before the war Germany, which was\r\nthe largest European consumer, utilized all its own production of lead\r\nores and imported an additional 10 per cent of the world's ores for\r\nsmelting, as well as considerable amounts of pig lead. Its principal\r\ndeposits were those of Silesia; under the Peace Treaty they may possibly\r\nbe lost to Poland, leaving German smelters largely dependent on imports.\r\nAustralia before the war normally shipped lead concentrates and pig lead\r\nto England and also to Belgium, Germany, and Japan. England, the second\r\nlargest European consumer, before the war had insufficient smelting\r\ncapacity within the British Empire and was partly dependent on\r\nforeign-smelted lead. During the war, however, England contracted for\r\nthe entire Australian output, and enlarged its smelting capacity\r\naccordingly. This may mean permanent loss to Belgium, which had depended\r\nmainly on the Australian ores for its smelting industry before the war.\r\n\r\nIn North Africa there is a small but steady production of lead, most of\r\nwhich goes to France. Recent developments in Burma have shown large\r\nreserves of high-grade lead-zinc-silver-copper ores, and this region may\r\nbe expected to become an important producer. There are also large\r\nreserves of lead in the Altai Mountains of southwestern Siberia and in\r\nthe Andes Mountains of South America.\r\n\r\nEngland, through control of Australian and Burman lead mines and\r\nsmelters, domestic smelting facilities, and some financial control in\r\nSpain, Mexico, and elsewhere, and France, through financial control of\r\nSpanish and North African mines and Spanish, Belgian, and domestic\r\nsmelters, have adequate supplies of lead.\r\n\r\nThe United States produces about a third of the world's lead and twice\r\nas much as any other country. Normally the domestic production is almost\r\nentirely consumed in this country. Mexico sends large quantities of\r\nbullion and ore to the United States to be smelted and refined in bond.\r\nMexican lead refined and exported by the United States equals in amount\r\none-sixth of the domestic production. Small quantities of ore or bullion\r\nfrom Canada, Africa, and South America are also brought into the United\r\nStates for treatment.\r\n\r\nThrough domestic production, smelting facilities for Mexican ore, and\r\ncommercial ownership in Mexico and elsewhere, the United States controls\r\nover 45 per cent of the world's lead production. Before the war Germany,\r\nthrough the \"Lead Convention\" or International Sales Association, and\r\nthrough smelting and selling contracts with large producing mines,\r\npractically controlled the European lead market as well as exports from\r\nMexico and the United States and from Australia. During the war German\r\nforeign influence was practically destroyed.\r\n\r\nIn the United States about a third of the production of lead comes from\r\nsoutheastern Missouri and about a fourth from the Coeur d'Alene\r\ndistrict of Idaho. The five states, Missouri, Idaho, Utah, Colorado and\r\nOklahoma, produce about nine-tenths of the country's total output.\r\nReserves of lead ore are not large in proportion to demand, contrasting\r\nin this regard with zinc ore.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nThe principal lead mineral is the sulphide, galena, from which the great\r\nbulk of the world's lead is derived. Cerussite (lead carbonate) and\r\nanglesite (lead sulphate) are mined in some places in the upper part of\r\nsulphide deposits, and supply a small fraction of the world's output.\r\n\r\nThe ores of lead are of two general classes:\r\n\r\nThe first class, the so-called \"soft\" lead ores, nearly free from copper\r\nand precious metals, and commonly associated with zinc ores, are found\r\nin sedimentary beds independent of igneous intrusion. They are of\r\nworld-wide distribution, were the first to be extensively exploited,\r\nwere at one time the dominant factor in world production of lead, and at\r\npresent produce about 30 per cent of the world's total. They are\r\nrepresented by the deposits of the Mississippi Valley, of Silesia, and\r\nsome of the Spanish deposits. The general description of the origin of\r\nthe zinc ores of the Mississippi Valley on pp. 216-218 applies to this\r\nclass of lead ores. It should be noted, however, that in the principal\r\nUnited States lead-producing district, that of southeastern Missouri,\r\nthe lead ores occur almost to the exclusion of the zinc ores, and are\r\nmore disseminated through the limestone than is characteristic of the\r\nzinc ores. Ores of this type have been found extending only to shallow\r\ndepths (not over a few hundred feet), and because of the absence of\r\nprecious metals their treatment is comparatively simple.\r\n\r\nThe second class consists of ores more complex in nature, which are\r\nfound in association with igneous rocks, and which usually contain some\r\nor all of the metals, zinc, silver, gold, copper, iron, manganese,\r\nantimony, bismuth, and rare metals, with various gangue minerals among\r\nwhich quartz, siderite, and silicates are important. Today these ores\r\nare the source of about 70 per cent of the world's lead. They are\r\nrepresented by the lead deposits of the Rocky Mountain region (Coeur\r\nd'Alene, Idaho; Leadville, Colorado; Bingham, Utah; etc.); of Broken\r\nHill, New South Wales; of Burma; and of many other places. They are all\r\nrelated to the earlier stages of the metamorphic cycle and occur in\r\nclose genetic association with igneous activity. They include deposits\r\nin the body of igneous rocks,--in the form of well-defined veins,\r\nreplacements along zones of fissuring and shearing, and disseminated\r\nmasses,--as well as veins and replacements in the rocks, particularly in\r\nlimestones, adjoining igneous intrusions. The deposits present a wide\r\nvariety of shapes depending on the courses of the solutions by which\r\nthey were formed. The materials of the ore minerals are believed to have\r\nbeen derived from the igneous rocks and to have been deposited by hot\r\nsolutions. The source of the solutions--whether magmatic or\r\nmeteoric--presents the same problems which have been discussed elsewhere\r\n(pp. 41-42). The ores are frequently mined to great depths. Because of\r\ntheir complexity they require involved processes of treatment to\r\nseparate out the values.\r\n\r\nOres of this nature have already been referred to in the discussion of\r\nthe copper ores of Bingham and Butte, and will be referred to in\r\nconnection with the zinc-lead-silver ores of Leadville, Colorado.\r\nSpecial reference may be made here to the Coeur d'Alene district of\r\nIdaho, which is the second largest producer of lead in the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nThe Coeur d'Alene deposits are almost unique in that they contain\r\ngalena as vein-fillings and replacements in quartzite, with a gangue of\r\nsiderite (iron carbonate). Quartzite (instead of limestone) is an\r\nunusual locus of replacement ores, and siderite is an unusual gangue.\r\nThese ores are believed to owe their origin to acid igneous intrusives,\r\nbecause of the close association of the ores with some of these\r\nintrusives, and because of the content of high-temperature minerals.\r\nSome of the ore bodies are found far from intrusives, but it is supposed\r\nthat in such cases further underground development may disclose the\r\nintrusives below the surface. Secondary concentration has been\r\ninsignificant.\r\n\r\nIn general, weathering of lead ores at the surface and secondary\r\nsulphide enrichment below are not so extensive as in the case of copper\r\nand zinc. Galena is fairly stable in the oxide zone, and even in moist\r\nclimates it is found in the outcrop of many veins. Weathering removes\r\nthe more soluble materials and concentrates the lead sulphide with the\r\nresidual clay and other gangue. In some districts cerussite and a little\r\nanglesite are also found in the oxide zone. The carrying down of lead in\r\nsolution and its deposition below the water table as a secondary\r\nsulphide is not proved on any extensive scale. In this respect it\r\ncontrasts with zinc; and when the two minerals occur together, lead is\r\nlikely to be more abundant in the oxide zone, and zinc in the sulphide\r\nzone below. Such a change in composition with depth is also found in\r\nsome cases as the result of primary vertical variations in the\r\nmineralization.\r\n\r\n\r\nZINC ORES\r\n\r\n\r\nECONOMIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nZinc metal has commonly gone under the name of \"spelter.\" Brass and\r\ngalvanized iron contain zinc as an essential ingredient. Of the total\r\nUnited States zinc consumption in normal times, about 60 per cent is\r\nused in galvanizing iron and steel objects to protect them from rust, 20\r\nper cent is used in the manufacture of brass and other alloys, 11 per\r\ncent goes into the form of rolled sheets for roofing, plumbing, etc., 1\r\nper cent is employed in desilverizing lead bullion, and the remaining 8\r\nper cent is used for pigments, electrodes, and other miscellaneous\r\npurposes. During the war the use in brass-making was greatly increased.\r\n\r\nThe zinc content of the ores mined today ranges from a little over\r\n1-1/2 per cent in the Joplin district of Missouri, to 25 per cent and\r\nhigher in some of the deposits of the Coeur d'Alene and other western\r\ncamps, and over 40 per cent in certain bonanzas in British Columbia and\r\nRussia. The ores usually contain both zinc and lead in varying\r\nproportions, and sometimes gold, silver, and copper are present. Of the\r\nzinc produced in the United States, about 73 per cent is obtained from\r\nores containing zinc as the principal element of value, about 25 per\r\ncent from zinc-lead ores, and 2 per cent from copper-zinc and other\r\nores. The average grade of the straight zinc ores is about 2-1/2 per\r\ncent.\r\n\r\nOf the world's zinc ore, the United States produces in normal times\r\nabout one-third, Germany about one-fifth, Australia about 15 per cent,\r\nItaly, North Africa and Spain each about 5 per cent. The remaining 15 to\r\n20 per cent comes from a large number of scattered sources, including\r\nJapan, East Asia, Norway and Sweden, Canada, Mexico, Austria, France,\r\nGreece, Siberia, and Russia. In the near future the Bawdwin mines of\r\nBurma will probably be increasingly important producers. Large reserves\r\nof zinc also exist in the Altai Mountains of southwestern Siberia, and\r\nin the Cordilleran region of South America. In short, zinc is one of the\r\nmost widely distributed of metallic resources; there is consequently\r\nless necessity for great international movements than in the case of\r\nmany other commodities.\r\n\r\nThe smelting of zinc concentrates is in general carried on close to the\r\npoints of consumption and where skilled labor is available, rather than\r\nat the mines,--although smelters to handle part of the output have\r\nrecently been built in Australia and in Burma. In Europe the great\r\nsmelting countries have been Germany and Belgium, and to a lesser extent\r\nEngland and France. Before the war these four countries with the United\r\nStates produced over nine-tenths of the world's spelter. Belgium did\r\nprincipally a custom business, and a large part of its exports went to\r\nEngland. Australian and Tasmanian zinc ores were the basis of the\r\nBelgian and English smelting industries, and also supplied about\r\none-third of the German requirements. Since the war England has\r\ncontracted to take practically the entire Australian output. This fact,\r\nin connection with war-time destruction of Belgian smelters, leaves the\r\nfuture of the Belgian zinc industry in some doubt. Germany may possibly\r\nlose to Poland its richest zinc mines, those of Silesia. German\r\nactivity in the rich deposits of Mexico is to be expected. France\r\ncontrols the deposits of North Africa and satisfies a considerable part\r\nof its requirements from that source. Smaller movements of zinc include\r\nexports from Italy to England, and a complex interchange among the\r\nlesser producers of Europe. English and French zinc-smelting capacity\r\nwas expanded during the war, and the industry in these countries is in a\r\nstrong position. Japan also developed a considerable smelting industry\r\nduring the war, importing ores from eastern Asia and Australia.\r\n\r\nThe United States normally smelts and consumes all its large production\r\nof zinc ores and does not enter foreign markets to any extent. Small\r\namounts of zinc concentrates are brought in from Mexico and Canada to be\r\nsmelted in bond. During the war,--when the Allies were cut off by enemy\r\noperations from the customary Belgian and German supplies of spelter,\r\nand by shortage of ships from Australian zinc ores,--Australian,\r\nSpanish, Italian, and other ores were imported into the United States,\r\nand large quantities of spelter were exported from this country to\r\nEurope. Mine and smelter capacities were greatly increased,\r\nover-production ensued, and with the cessation of hostilities many\r\nplants were obliged to curtail or cease operations. The United States\r\nhas now about 40 per cent of the zinc-smelting capacity of the world.\r\nFor the present at least the capacity is far in excess of the domestic\r\nrequirements.\r\n\r\nBefore the war German control of the international zinc market was even\r\nstronger than in the case of lead. The German Zinc Syndicate, through\r\nits affiliations, joint share-holdings, ownership of mines and smelters,\r\nand especially through smelting and selling contracts, controlled\r\ndirectly one-half of the world's output of zinc and three-fourths of the\r\nEuropean production. It regulated the Australian exports by means of\r\nlong-term contracts, and had considerable influence in the United\r\nStates. To some extent it was able to so manipulate the market that zinc\r\noutside the syndicate was also indirectly controlled. During the war\r\npolitical jurisdiction was used by the Allied countries to destroy this\r\nGerman influence.\r\n\r\nIn the United States the principal zinc-producing regions are the Joplin\r\nand adjacent districts of Missouri, Oklahoma, Kansas, and Arkansas,\r\nfurnishing about one-third of the country's output; the Franklin Furnace\r\ndistrict of New Jersey, and the Butte district of Montana, each\r\nyielding about one-sixth of the total supply; and the Upper Mississippi\r\nValley district of Wisconsin, Iowa, and Illinois, the Leadville district\r\nof Colorado, and the Coeur d'Alene district of Idaho, each producing\r\nbetween one-tenth and one-twentieth of the total. Smaller quantities are\r\nproduced in Tennessee, New Mexico, Nevada, and several other states.\r\n\r\nReserves of zinc are ample for the future. They are now developed\r\nconsiderably in advance of probable requirements, a fact which causes\r\nkeen competition for markets and renders zinc-mining more or less\r\nsensitive to market changes.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nThe most important mineral of zinc is the sulphide, sphalerite or \"zinc\r\nblende.\" The minerals of the oxide zone are smithsonite (zinc carbonate)\r\nand calamine (hydrous zinc silicate), which yield minor amounts of zinc\r\nand are especially productive at Leadville, Colorado. Zincite (zinc\r\noxide) and willemite (zinc silicate) are the important minerals in the\r\ndeposits of Franklin Furnace, New Jersey. The association of most\r\ndeposits of zinc with more or less lead has been noted.\r\n\r\nThe ores of zinc are of two general classes, corresponding to the two\r\nclasses of lead ores (pp. 211-212). Zinc ores of the first type are in\r\nveins and replacements in sedimentary rocks at shallow depths,\r\nindependent of igneous association, and are supposed to have been formed\r\nby cold solutions. They are found in the Mississippi Valley, in Silesia,\r\nand in many of the smaller European deposits. They were formerly the\r\nleading zinc-producers, and now produce about 45 per cent of the world's\r\ntotal. Zinc ores of the second type consist of veins and replacements\r\nrelated to intrusive rocks, sometimes extending to considerable depths,\r\nand of more complex composition. They include most of the deposits of\r\nthe American Cordilleran region (Butte, Coeur d'Alene, Leadville,\r\netc.), of Franklin Furnace, of Australia, of Burma, and of many other\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\nThe zinc-lead ores of the type found in the Mississippi Valley are of\r\nspecial interest, in that they are sulphide ores of an origin apparently\r\nindependent of igneous agencies. These ores occur as fissure-fillings\r\nand replacements, mainly in nearly flat-lying Paleozoic limestones and\r\ndolomites--the Bonne Terre dolomitic limestone of southeastern Missouri,\r\nthe Boone formation of southwestern Missouri and Oklahoma, the Galena\r\ndolomite of Wisconsin and Illinois. They are variously associated with a\r\ngangue of dolomite, calcite, quartz, iron pyrite, barite, and chert. Not\r\ninfrequently they are spread out both in sheets and in disseminated form\r\nalong carbonaceous layers within or at the base of the limestone.\r\n\r\nThe source of the primary sulphides has been a subject of much\r\ndiscussion. All are agreed that they were first deposited with the\r\nsediments in minutely dispersed form, through the agency of the organic\r\ncontents of the sediments, and that such deposition was somewhat\r\ngenerally localized by estuarine conditions which favored the\r\naccumulation of organic remains. Many years ago, before the evidence of\r\nestuarine deposition was recognized, Chamberlin suggested an ingenious\r\nhypothesis for the northern Mississippi Valley,--that the organic\r\nmaterial had been localized by ocean's currents forming something in the\r\nnature of a Sargasso sea. Differences of opinion become acute, however,\r\nwhen the attempt is made to name the precise sedimentary horizon, out of\r\nseveral available horizons, in which for the most part this primary\r\nconcentration occurred. Judging from the organic contents of the several\r\nbeds, the primary source may have been below, within, or above the\r\npresent ore-bearing horizons. If the ore came from the lower horizons,\r\nit was introduced into its present situation by an artesian circulation,\r\nfor which the structural conditions are favorable. If the ore was\r\nderived from overlying horizons, downward moving solutions accompanying\r\nerosion did the work. If the primary source was within the horizon of\r\npresent occurrence of the ores, both upward and downward moving waters\r\nmay have modified and transported them locally. For each of these\r\nhypotheses a plausible case can be made; but much of the evidence can be\r\nused interchangeably for any one of them. In spite of the wealth of data\r\navailable, it is astonishingly difficult to arrive at a conclusion which\r\nis exclusive of other possibilities. Without attempting to argue the\r\nmatter in detail the writer merely records his view, based on some\r\nfamiliarity with these districts, that, on the whole, the evidence\r\nfavors the accumulation of these deposits by downward moving meteoric\r\nsolutions during the weathering of overlying strata; but that it is by\r\nno means certain that a part of the ores has not been derived from lower\r\nhorizons. The great area of the producing districts in comparison with\r\ntheir depth, the uniform association of the ore-bearing zone with the\r\nsurface regardless of geologic horizon uncovered by erosion, the failure\r\nof the ores to extend in quantity under cappings of later formations,\r\nand the known efficacy of oxidizing waters in local downward transfers\r\nof zinc and lead, seem to suggest concentrating agencies which are\r\nclearly related to surface conditions.\r\n\r\nIt is of interest to note that in many places in the limestones of\r\nMissouri and Virginia, and elsewhere in the Paleozoic rocks, there are\r\nsinks of limonite and clay near the surface, which are likewise believed\r\nto have originated through downward movement of waters deriving their\r\nmineral contents from the erosion and stripping of overlying sediments.\r\nStill further, the primary deposition of Clinton iron ores in many parts\r\nof the Mississippi Valley and eastward to the Appalachians took place in\r\nstratigraphic horizons not far removed from the horizons of lead and\r\nzinc deposition. When the peculiar conditions controlling the deposition\r\nof the Clinton ores are understood (see pp. 52-53) it is entirely\r\npossible that they may throw some light on the genesis of the lead and\r\nzinc ores.\r\n\r\nSince the ores were introduced into essentially their present locations,\r\nsecondary concentration has produced an oxide zone of clay, chert, and\r\niron oxide, with varying amounts of zinc carbonate, zinc silicate, lead\r\nsulphide, and rarely lead carbonate. This zone is obviously developed\r\nabove water level, and is seldom as much as 100 feet thick. Zinc, and to\r\na less extent lead, have been taken into solution as sulphates, with the\r\naid of sulphuric acid resulting from the oxidation of the associated\r\npyrite. Zinc has been carried away from the weathered zone in solution\r\nfaster than lead, leaving the lead more or less concentrated near the\r\nsurface. Some of the zinc carried down has been redeposited secondarily\r\nas zinc sulphide. Evidences of this secondary sulphide enrichment can be\r\nseen in many places; yet certain broad quantitative considerations raise\r\na doubt as to whether this process has been responsible for the main\r\nportion of the values of the sulphide zone. If downward secondary\r\nenrichment had been a dominant process, it might be expected that the\r\nores would be richer in places where erosion had cut away more than\r\nhalf the limestone formation carrying the ore, than in places where it\r\nhad barely cut into the formation. This is not the fact,--which suggests\r\nthat erosion in its downward progress has carried a large part of the\r\nzinc completely out of the vicinity.\r\n\r\nZinc ores of this same general character are also found in Paleozoic\r\nrocks (Knox dolomite) in Virginia and Tennessee. Their manner of\r\noccurrence suggests the same problem of origin as in Missouri and\r\nWisconsin, but no decisive evidence of their source has been discovered.\r\n\r\nOf the zinc ores associated with igneous intrusions, those of the Butte\r\nand Coeur d'Alene districts are described in connection with copper\r\nand lead ores on pp. 201-203, 208, and 212-213.\r\n\r\nZinc constitutes about 75 per cent by weight of the recoverable metals\r\nof the Leadville district of Colorado. About two-thirds of the zinc\r\noccurs as the sulphide and about one-third as the carbonate resulting\r\nfrom weathering of the sulphide. The zinc sulphide is associated with\r\nlead, iron, and copper sulphides and gold and silver minerals. In the\r\noxide zone the zinc carbonate is associated with oxides and carbonates\r\nof various metals, including those of lead, copper, iron, and manganese.\r\nThe iron and manganese oxides are mined in considerable tonnage as a\r\nflux. It is an interesting fact that, although mining has been carried\r\non in this district for upwards of forty years, only within the last\r\ndecade has the existence of zinc ores in the oxide zone been recognized.\r\nThis has been due largely to the fact that the iron and manganese oxides\r\neffectively stain and mask the zinc carbonate.\r\n\r\nThe Leadville ores occur as replacements and vein-fillings in a gently\r\nfaulted and folded Carboniferous limestone, in deposits of a general\r\ntabular shape, parallel to the bedding but with very irregular lower\r\nsurfaces. The limestone is intruded by numerous sheets of porphyry,\r\nmainly parallel to the bedding but sometimes cutting across it, against\r\nthe under sides of which most of the ore occurs. The primary sulphides\r\nare believed to be genetically related in some fashion to these\r\nporphyries. The older view was that the agents of deposition were\r\naqueous solutions from the surface above, which derived their mineral\r\ncontent chiefly from the porphyries. Later views favor solutions coming\r\ndirectly from the porphyries or deeper igneous sources. While in form\r\nand association these ores are characteristic igneous contact deposits,\r\nthey lack the high-temperature silicates which are so distinctive of\r\nmany ores of this type.\r\n\r\nThe zinc ores of Franklin Furnace, New Jersey, belong in the group\r\nassociated with igneous agencies, but have certain unique features. They\r\nconsist of willemite and zincite, together with large amounts of\r\nfranklinite (an iron-manganese oxide) and silicates, in a pre-Cambrian\r\nwhite crystalline limestone near its contact with a coarse-grained\r\ngranite-gneiss. The origin of the ores is obscured by later shearing and\r\nmetamorphism, but it seems best explained by replacement of the\r\nlimestone by heated solutions coming from the granitic mass. The view\r\nhas also been advanced that the ores originated in the limestone before\r\nthe advent of the igneous rocks. Secondary concentration is not\r\napparent.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[33] Ransome, Frederick Leslie, The copper deposits of Ray and Miami,\r\nArizona: _Prof. Paper 115, U.S. Geol. Survey_, 1919, pp. 12-13.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nGOLD, SILVER, AND PLATINUM MINERALS\r\n\r\n\r\nGOLD ORES\r\n\r\n\r\nECONOMIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nThe principal and most essential use of gold is as a standard of value\r\nand a medium of exchange. Gold has been prized since the earliest times\r\nbecause of its luster, color, malleability, and indestructibility, and\r\nhas long been used as a trading medium. At present little of the metal\r\nis actually circulated from hand to hand. Stocks of gold, however,\r\naccumulated by governments and banking interests, form the essential\r\nfoundation of paper currency and of the vast modern system of credit\r\nrelations. In the settlement of international trade balances\r\nconsiderable quantities of gold frequently move from debtor to creditor\r\nnations. Although the amounts thus shipped are frequently great in\r\nvalue, they are very small in volume. It is interesting to note that the\r\nentire accumulated gold stocks of the world's governments--about nine\r\nbillion dollars--cast in a solid block, with the horizontal dimensions\r\nof the Washington monument, would be only about 12 feet high.\r\n\r\nOther uses of gold are in dentistry, and in the arts for jewelry,\r\ngilding, and other forms of ornamentation. Consumption for these\r\npurposes has been increasing of late years and now takes a third or more\r\nof the world's annual production. In the United States, before war-time\r\nrestrictions were adopted, the consumption for jewelry and similar uses\r\nexceeded the consumption in coinage. Since the war it has exceeded the\r\ntotal domestic production of gold. An interesting problem for the future\r\nis how an adequate supply of gold is to be distributed between monetary\r\nuses and the arts. The curve of increase in the requirements of the arts\r\nindicates that, unless there is greatly increased production, all the\r\nworld's gold will be necessary for the arts in a comparatively few\r\nyears. To retain it for monetary purposes would require government\r\nrestrictions.\r\n\r\nOf all the mineral commodities, gold has played perhaps the most\r\nimportant and certainly the most romantic part in the world's history.\r\nThe \"lure of gold\" has taken men to the remotest corners of the globe.\r\nIt has been the moving force in the settlement and colonization of new\r\ncountries, in numerous wars, and in many other strenuous activities of\r\nthe human race.\r\n\r\nAbout two-thirds of the annual gold production of the world comes from\r\nthe British Empire--from South and West Africa, Australasia, Canada, and\r\nIndia. A single colony, the Transvaal, produces about 40 per cent of the\r\nworld's total. British capital, which seems to have a particular\r\naffinity for investments in gold mines, controls not only the larger\r\npart of the output from the colonies, but also important mines in\r\nSiberia, Mexico, South America, and the United States.\r\n\r\nRussia, Mexico, and Japan have small gold production. The chief deposits\r\nof Russia are those of Siberia, which have had an important output and\r\nhave apparent great possibilities of increase. Other foreign districts\r\nare numerous and widely scattered, but, with the exception of Colombia\r\nand Korea, no one of them yields 1 per cent of the world's gold.\r\n\r\nFrench interests control about a tenth of the production of the\r\nTransvaal, and minor supplies in Mexico and South America--in all about\r\n6 per cent of the world's production. Germany and Austria control less\r\nthan 1 per cent of the total gold production. German interests formerly\r\nhad extensive holdings in South Africa and Australia, but during the war\r\nthis control was eliminated.\r\n\r\nThe United States, the second largest gold-producing country, supplies\r\nabout 20 per cent of the world's total. Commercially it controls\r\nproduction of another 5 per cent in foreign countries, chiefly in\r\nCanada, Mexico, South America, and Korea. About one-fourth of the United\r\nStates production comes from California. Other producing states in order\r\nof importance are Colorado, Alaska, South Dakota, Nevada, Arizona,\r\nMontana, and Utah. These eight states supply 95 per cent of the\r\ncountry's output, and most of the remainder is obtained from other\r\nwestern states.\r\n\r\nInternational movements of gold depend chiefly upon its use in the\r\nsettlement of trade balances, and are not governed by the considerations\r\nwhich control ordinary mineral commodities. Imports and exports vary\r\nwith changing foreign trade balances. Large amounts of gold normally go\r\nto London, because Great Britain requires all gold produced in the\r\ncolonies to be sent to England; but since England ordinarily has an\r\nunfavorable balance of trade, much of this gold is reexported. The\r\nUnited States up to a few years ago was also a debtor nation, and more\r\ngold was exported than was imported. During the war, however, this\r\ncountry became the greatest of the creditor nations and imports of gold,\r\nchiefly from Europe, were several times the exports.\r\n\r\nThe total world's gold production up to 1920 has been upwards of 19\r\nbillions of dollars, of which about 10 billions have gone into the arts\r\nor been hidden and lost, leaving 9 billions in monetary reserve.\r\n\r\nAt the present writing the United States government holds an unusually\r\nlarge fraction of the world's gold reserve, about 28 per cent or 2\r\nbillion dollars,--an amount equal to two-thirds of the aggregate\r\nproduction of the United States to date. Other large stocks of gold are\r\nheld, in order, by Great Britain, France, and Russia, these three with\r\nthe United States holding over a half of the world's total gold reserve.\r\nGermany has about 1-1/2 per cent of the total reserve, and, with its\r\ntremendous debt and no sources of new production, is of course in a\r\nparticularly unfavorable position.\r\n\r\nThe total amount of gold now (1920) accounted for by governments as\r\nmoney is not more than 10 per cent of the value of the notes and\r\ncurrency issued against this gold. Before the war it was 60 per cent. In\r\nthe United States the pre-war percentage was 99-1/2 per cent. Since the\r\nwar it has been 45 per cent. The ratio of gold to currency is now so\r\nsmall that the gold standard is hardly a physical fact, but is to be\r\nregarded rather more as a profession of faith. Notwithstanding the\r\nrecent falling off in gold production, an increment of approximately 350\r\nmillion dollars is potentially available each year to be added to the\r\ngold reserves. Whether this increment, or a larger increment which may\r\ncome from new discoveries, is sufficient to maintain a reasonable\r\nproportion between gold stocks and the necessary normal increase in\r\npaper currency, has been, and doubtless will continue to be, a subject\r\nof vigorous discussion and speculation.\r\n\r\nDuring and immediately following the war, the gold production of the\r\nworld showed rather an alarming progressive decrease. About 1915 the\r\ngroup of three greatest producers--South Africa, United States, and\r\nAustralia,--reached the acme of its production, and output then fell\r\noff. Simultaneously there was a marked decrease of production in many of\r\nthe less important districts. This general decline was due in\r\nconsiderable part to the fact that during the war the price of gold was\r\nfixed and its use restricted to monetary purposes. The price of gold,\r\nwhich is itself the standard of value, could not rise to offset growing\r\nmining costs and to maintain profits, as was the case with iron, copper,\r\nand the other metals,--with the result that the margin of profit in gold\r\nmining became so small as materially to affect exploration and\r\nproduction. Another important cause of decreased production was the\r\nactual exhaustion of certain mines, and the lowering of the grades of\r\nore available in many others. New discoveries did not supply these\r\ndeficiencies. In the United States, for instance, physical conditions of\r\none kind or another were responsible for lessening of production from\r\nAlaska, Cripple Creek, and California. Minor causes included conflicts\r\nin California between agricultural and mining interests over water\r\nrights, and a succession of dry seasons which did not afford enough\r\nwater for the working of placers; and in Alaska difficulties due to\r\nlitigation over the oil-flotation process of recovering gold from its\r\nores. As a result of all these conditions, many of the smaller mines\r\nwere closed down, others continued operations only by curtailing\r\nexploration and by mining solely the richest and most accessible ore\r\nbodies, and there was a general discouragement and lack of inducement to\r\nengage in gold mining.\r\n\r\nThe gold situation has become a matter of great concern to the various\r\ngovernments, since national financial stability and the confidence of\r\nthe public in the national credit are based largely upon the acquirement\r\nof an adequate gold reserve. Both in England and in the United States,\r\ncommittees of experts have been appointed to make exhaustive\r\ninvestigations and present recommendations for measures to stimulate\r\nproduction. The report of the joint committee from the United States\r\nBureau of Mines and Geological Survey gives a comprehensive review of\r\nthe conditions in the gold-mining industry.[34]\r\n\r\nDuring the war there was vigorous demand by gold miners both in the\r\nUnited States and South Africa for a bonus on gold. These demands\r\nreceived serious consideration on the part of the governments, but were\r\ndenied on the general ground of the doubtful adequacy of such a measure\r\nto meet the situation, and the danger of upsetting the gold standard of\r\nvalue. In the United States, for instance, a bonus of $10 per ounce was\r\nasked for. It did not appear likely that this could increase the annual\r\nproduction from the United States by more than 10 per cent, in face of\r\nthe physical conditions being met in gold mining. The bonus would have\r\nhad to be paid on all the gold mined, which would make the increment of\r\nproduction very expensive; to secure an added production of ten million\r\ndollars would have cost in the neighborhood of forty millions. Ten\r\nmillions is only one-third of 1 per cent of the gold reserve already\r\nheld by this country, and it would obviously have taken a long time for\r\nthis small increase in annual production to make itself felt in the size\r\nof the gold reserves.\r\n\r\nSince the war gold has gone to a considerable premium in England, due to\r\nthe action of the British government in establishing a \"free\"\r\nmarket,--that is, abandoning the restriction that gold marketed in\r\nLondon should be offered to the government or the Bank of England at the\r\nfixed statutory price for monetary purposes. With the pound sterling at\r\na considerable discount outside of England, other countries could afford\r\nto bid, in terms of British currency, far above the British mint price.\r\nThe result is that the South African miner of gold receives a premium\r\ndue to depreciation of sterling exchange, while the American miner still\r\nreceives the regular mint price. The agitation for a bonus therefore\r\ncontinues in the United States. However, with the removal of war-time\r\nrestrictions gold has been allowed to go to the arts, the demand from\r\nwhich is already equal to one-third of the world's gold production, is\r\nrapidly increasing, and is temporarily acute due to the accumulation of\r\nrequirements resulting from war restrictions. This situation has a\r\ngeneral tendency to improve the position of the gold miner, though the\r\noutlook is still far from bright.\r\n\r\nIt is an interesting fact that India is absorbing a good half of the\r\nfree gold. India, in regard to its demand for precious metals and\r\nstones, has been described as \"an abyss from which there is no return.\"\r\nThis is an important contributing cause of the shortage of gold in the\r\nrest of the world.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to the future, it seems that increased exploration,\r\nwhich is resulting from the present premium on gold, is likely to bring\r\nin new reserves to increase production. Because of lack of important\r\ndiscoveries in recent years, there is pessimism in some quarters as to\r\nthe possibilities of large increase of production; but, considering the\r\nhistory of gold discoveries, and the amount of ground still to be\r\nexplored both areally and vertically, this pessimism does not seem to be\r\nwholly justified from the geologic standpoint. Curves representing the\r\nworld's gold production in past years show periods of increasing annual\r\nproduction as new fields are discovered, followed by periods of\r\ndecreasing production when no new ore bodies are coming in to replace\r\ndwindling reserves. It is entirely possible that in recent years the\r\ngold-mining industry has been merely in one of these temporary stagnant\r\nperiods. There are many regions, both in the vicinity of worked-out\r\nlodes and in unsettled and poorly explored countries, where gold may\r\nstill be discovered; there may be far greater resources of this metal\r\nstill covered up than all those which man has thus far uncovered. A\r\nsingle new deposit or district may make a great difference in the\r\nworld's production, as suggested by the experience of the past. Regions\r\nwhich are especially attractive for exploration and the discovery of new\r\ndeposits are in Siberia and South America, which in the opinion of many\r\nengineers may eventually rival South Africa. Mexico, with the\r\nestablishment of a stable government, should also have a greatly\r\nincreased production.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nThe principal gold mineral is native or metallic gold. This occurs in\r\nnature in small scales, crystals, and irregular masses, and also in\r\nmicroscopic particles mechanically mixed with pyrite and other\r\nsulphides. Chemically, gold is very inactive and combines with but few\r\nother elements. A small part of the world's supply is obtained from the\r\ngold-silver tellurides--calaverite, sylvanite, krennerite, and petzite.\r\n\r\nGold deposits are of two general classes--placers, and veins or lodes.\r\n\r\nPlacers, which are in general the more easily discovered and more easily\r\nworked deposits, have in the past been the chief source of the world's\r\ngold supply. It is estimated that in the first twenty-seven years of the\r\nmodern era of gold-mining, beginning with the discovery of gold in\r\nCalifornia in 1848, 87 per cent of the world's production was obtained\r\nfrom placers. At present the placers of recent geologic age supply a\r\ntenth to a fifth of the gold, and ancient or fossil placers in the\r\nTransvaal supply another two-fifths. In the United States about a fourth\r\nof the gold production comes from placers, mainly from California and\r\nAlaska.\r\n\r\nPlacers are detrital or fragmental sediments containing the ore in\r\nmechanical fragments, which are derived from the erosion and\r\ntransportation of solid-rock veins or lodes, sometimes called the\r\n\"mother lode.\" During the process of transportation and deposition there\r\nis more or less sorting, because of differing density of the mineral\r\nfragments, resulting in the segregation or concentration of the ore\r\nminerals in certain layers or channels. Gold, because of its weight,\r\ntends to work down toward bedrock, or into scoured or excavated portions\r\nof stream channels. In a few cases it is carried in some quantity to the\r\nsea and concentrated in beach sands. The processes are not unlike the\r\nmechanical concentration of ores by crushing and water sorting. Seldom,\r\nhowever, do the processes go far enough in nature to produce an ore\r\nwhich can be used directly without some further mechanical sorting. Ore\r\nminerals concentrated in placers are those which resist abrasion and\r\nchemical solution during the processes of weathering and transportation,\r\nand which have a density sufficiently high so that they are partially\r\nsorted out and concentrated from the accompanying quartz and other\r\nminerals. To warrant their recovery they must also be of such high\r\nintrinsic value that it pays to mine small quantities. The most\r\nimportant of such minerals are gold, tin, platinum, and the precious\r\nstones. Iron, copper, lead, and zinc minerals are often somewhat\r\nconcentrated as placers, but their intrinsic value is not high enough to\r\nwarrant the attempt to recover them in the large amounts necessary to\r\nmake them commercially available.\r\n\r\nPlacers are forming now and have formed at all stages of the earth's\r\nhistory. Early placers may be reworked and further concentrated by\r\nrenewal of the proper erosional and transportational conditions. Old\r\nplacers may be buried beneath younger rocks, cemented, and more or less\r\nrecrystallized. \"Fossil\" placers of this kind are best represented by\r\ndeposits in the Black Hills of South Dakota and probably by the South\r\nAfrican gold deposits.\r\n\r\nIn the Witwatersrand deposits of South Africa, the gold is concentrated\r\nin the lower parts of large conglomerate and quartz sand layers of great\r\nareal extent. Pebbles of the conglomerate are mainly quartz and\r\nquartzite. The gold, in particles hardly visible to the eye, is in a\r\nsandy matrix and is associated with chloritoid, sericite, calcite,\r\ngraphite, and other minerals. The origin of the gold deposits of this\r\ndistrict is not entirely agreed on, but the evidence seems on the whole\r\nto favor their placer origin. Some investigators of these ores believe\r\nthem to have been introduced into the conglomerate and sand by later\r\nsolutions, possibly by hot solutions related to certain diabase\r\nintrusions that cut the beds.\r\n\r\nIn the vein or lode or hard-rock deposits, the gold is mainly metallic\r\ngold, and to a minor extent is in the form of gold tellurides. It is\r\nusually closely associated with iron pyrite in a matrix or gangue of\r\nquartz. Seldom is a gold deposit free from important values in other\r\nminerals. About 84 per cent of the gold mined in vein or lode deposits\r\nof the United States is associated with silver minerals, the combined\r\nvalue averaging about $6 per ton; about 13 per cent comes from copper\r\nores which have an average yield of gold and silver of 50c. per ton; and\r\n3 per cent comes from zinc and lead ores, with an average gold and\r\nsilver yield ranging from $1 to $6 per ton. The geologic occurrence of\r\ngold in the copper, lead, and zinc ores has already been referred to in\r\nthe discussions of these ores.\r\n\r\nReference will be made here only to the vein deposits in which gold,\r\nwith silver, constitutes the principal values. Because of their common\r\ngangue of quartz these are often called \"dry\" or \"siliceous\" ores. Their\r\nprincipal occurrence is in distinct fissure veins in igneous rocks, with\r\nmore or less replacement of the wall rock. The igneous rocks are\r\ncommonly acid intrusives of a granite or porphyry type, less commonly\r\nintrusives of gabbro and diabase and surface lavas of rhyolite and\r\nbasalt. In a few cases the ores are contact-metamorphic deposits of the\r\ntype described under copper ores. In still rarer cases they are in\r\npegmatites. Gold is commonly associated with minerals and wall-rock\r\nalterations indicating deposition by hot solutions, which are inferred\r\nto have come from the igneous rocks.\r\n\r\nBecause of the resistant nature both of ore minerals and gangue,\r\nweathering and secondary concentration have had little effect in\r\nenriching gold deposits. So far as there has been any noticeable effect\r\non the gold content of the ores, it has been due to the leaching out of\r\nother constituents, principally pyrite and other sulphides, leaving the\r\ngold present in slightly larger proportions. Locally there is evidence\r\nof solution of gold in weathered zones and its deposition in the\r\nsulphide zones below. Solution is believed to be accomplished by\r\nchloride solutions, and is favored by the presence of manganese which\r\ndelays precipitation. The precipitating agent below may be ferrous\r\nsulphate, various sulphides, native metals, or organic matter.\r\n\r\nOf the vein or lode gold ores in the United States some of the most\r\nproductive and best known have the following geologic features:\r\n\r\nThe California gold belt extends north and south along the west slope of\r\nthe Sierra Nevada Mountains. The ore is in a series of parallel and\r\noverlapping veins striking with the trend of the range, associated with\r\ngranodiorite intrusives in schist and slate. There is no pronounced\r\nsecondary concentration. These deposits are the source of most of the\r\ngreat placer deposits of California, hence the name \"Mother Lode\"\r\napplied to a part of them. The principal ore deposits are somewhat\r\nremoved from the main mass of intrusive which forms the crest of the\r\nSierra Nevada range, and are more closely related to the smaller similar\r\nintrusive masses farther down the slope. The gangue is mainly quartz.\r\n\r\nAt Juneau, Alaska, great dikes of albite-diorite intrude greenstones and\r\nschists, and low-grade gold ores occur in shattered portions of the\r\ndiorite. These ores were mined on a great scale at the Treadwell Mine.\r\n\r\nAnother famous low-grade deposit is the Homestake Mine in the Black\r\nHills of South Dakota, where pre-Cambrian slates and schists of\r\nsedimentary origin are impregnated with gold, associated with quartz,\r\ndolomite, calcite, pyrite, and other minerals. The origin is supposed to\r\nhave some connection with intrusives into the schists; but the relations\r\nof the ores to intrusives, both in age and in place, present many\r\npuzzling questions which make conclusion as to origin very difficult.\r\n\r\nIn the Cripple Creek district of Colorado, a volcanic neck two or three\r\nmiles in diameter breaks through pre-Cambrian granites, gneisses, and\r\nschists. The volcanic rocks consist mainly of tuffs and breccias cut by\r\nbasic dikes. The ore bodies are in fissures and sheeted zones,\r\nprincipally in the granitic rocks, but associated with these dikes. The\r\nore is mainly gold telluride, in a gangue of quartz together with pyrite\r\nand a variety of minerals characteristic of hot-water solutions. Also\r\nthe wall rocks have the characteristic hot-water alterations. There is\r\nslight enrichment near the surface.\r\n\r\nAt Goldfield, Nevada, native gold is found in surface igneous flows of a\r\ndacite type, which have undergone extensive hydrothermal alterations\r\ncharacterized by the development of alunite (a potassium-aluminum\r\nsulphate), quartz, and pyrite. The ore fills fissures to some extent,\r\nbut is mainly a replacement of the wall rock. Association with typical\r\nhot-water minerals and hydrothermal alterations of the wall rock are\r\nagain believed to indicate the origin of the ores through ascending hot\r\nsolutions from a deep source.\r\n\r\nOne of the interesting features of this occurrence is the abundance of\r\nalunite. Sulphate minerals are commonly formed by oxidizing solutions.\r\nThe abundant presence, therefore, of a sulphate mineral with minerals of\r\na primary deep-seated source has led to much discussion of origin. The\r\nhypothesis was developed that these minerals result from the interaction\r\nof deep-seated sulphide-bearing solutions with surface oxidizing\r\nsolutions.[35] It may be noted that in recent years other sulphate\r\nminerals have been occasionally regarded as primary, including gypsum,\r\nanhydrite, barite, and others. It has been suggested that if igneous\r\nemanations contain free oxygen and sulphur, or sulphur dioxide, it would\r\nbe expected that as they become cool sulphur trioxide would be formed\r\nwhich would result in the sulphate at suitable temperature.[36]\r\n\r\nOther deposits containing gold are discussed in connection with silver\r\non following pages.\r\n\r\n\r\nSILVER ORES\r\n\r\n\r\nECONOMIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nSilver has two important uses--in money and in the arts. As money, it is\r\nused in the United States and Europe for subsidiary coinage,--silver\r\ncoins normally circulating at more than their intrinsic value,--but its\r\ngreatest monetary use is in India and China, where it has been the basis\r\nfor the settlement of foreign exchange balances. In China also it is the\r\nmoney standard of the country. In the arts, silver is employed chiefly\r\nin the making of articles of luxury, such as jewelry and tableware. In\r\nthe Orient this use is closely related to its use as money, since the\r\nnatives invest their savings both in silver jewelry and silver coins.\r\nThere is some consumption of silver by certain chemical industries, and\r\nquantities of increasing importance are used in the form of silver salts\r\nby the photographic and moving picture industries. It has been estimated\r\nthat before 1914 about two-thirds of the new silver produced went into\r\nthe arts and one-third into money. During the war, however, increasing\r\namounts were used in coinage, and less than one-fifth of the output was\r\nused in the arts. Demands for silver for monetary purposes will probably\r\ncontinue to take the larger part of the world's production for some\r\ntime. In this connection it may be noted that India has adopted a gold\r\nstandard, but that the conservative habits of the population will\r\ndoubtless continue to call for large amounts of silver.\r\n\r\nAbout half of the silver production of the world comes from the dry or\r\nsiliceous silver ores, which are mined solely for that metal and the\r\nassociated gold; and about half of the production is obtained as a\r\nby-product in the mining of other metals, principally copper and lead.\r\nThe average grades of these ores, in combined values of gold and silver,\r\nwere referred to on p. 228. While the aggregate amount of silver\r\nobtained as a by-product of other ores is large, the percentage of\r\nsilver in the copper or lead in any mine is ordinarily very small.\r\nConsequently the world output of silver depends to a considerable extent\r\nupon conditions in the copper- and lead-mining industries.\r\n\r\nOf the total world output of silver, normally about 75 per cent comes\r\nfrom North America. Of this the United States and Mexico each produce\r\nabout two-fifths and Canada one-fifth, and minor amounts are produced in\r\nCentral America. In late years, political disturbances in Mexico reduced\r\nthat country's production to less than half the normal figure, and the\r\nUnited States took the place which Mexico had held for many years as the\r\nleading silver producer. The United States and Mexican supply is\r\nobtained from the Rocky Mountain belt, and the Canadian production comes\r\nchiefly from the Cobalt, Ontario, district. Outside of North America the\r\nprincipal producing areas are Australia, South America (Peru and to a\r\nless extent Bolivia and Chile), Europe (chiefly from Spain, Germany, and\r\nAustria-Hungary, but with smaller amounts from all the other countries),\r\nand Japan. Thus, while there are sources of silver in many places, the\r\ngreat bulk of the world's output comes from North America. In the\r\nfinancial ownership of mines, including ownership in other countries,\r\nthe United States controls over half the world's silver, Great Britain\r\nabout a third, and Germany about a tenth (principally in Mexico).\r\n\r\nAll the silver mined in the United States is smelted and refined by\r\ndomestic plants; and in addition much of the Canadian, Mexican, and\r\nSouth and Central American silver is exported to the United States as\r\nore and base bullion, to be treated in this country. The United States\r\nis therefore the great silver-selling country of the world.\r\n\r\nThe great silver-consuming countries are India and China, and normally\r\nabout a half of the world's output goes to these two countries. This\r\nmajor movement of silver, from America to the Far East, takes place\r\nthrough the London market, since England has been the chief nation\r\ntrading in the Orient. The balance of the world's silver consumption is\r\nwidely distributed among the countries of Europe and South America and\r\nthe United States (which consumes about one-tenth of the total). For the\r\nEuropean trade most of the silver also goes through London, which is the\r\ngreat clearing-house and the market where prices are fixed.\r\n\r\nIn the later years of the war and immediately after, the demands for\r\nsilver were probably twice the world's output. The resulting rise in\r\nprice was unprecedented. Silver actually became worth more as bullion\r\nthan as currency, and in Europe much trouble was experienced because of\r\nits withdrawal from currency to be melted up. This condition was later\r\nfollowed by an equally striking drop in price as supply caught up with\r\ndemand.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, as in many other countries, it was desired during\r\nthe war to accumulate large stocks of gold as a basis of credit for the\r\nflotation of government loans, and the export of gold was prohibited.\r\nConsequently in the settlement of foreign trade balances, particularly\r\nwith the nations of the Orient, very large amounts of silver bullion had\r\nto be used. Current production proved inadequate, and it was necessary\r\nto utilize the stocks of silver dollars in the United States Treasury.\r\nTo this end the Pittman Silver Act, passed in April, 1918, authorized\r\nthe melting down and conversion into bullion of 350,000,000 dollars out\r\nof the Treasury stock, and the retirement of a corresponding number of\r\nsilver certificates and the issue of Federal Reserve bank notes. In this\r\nmanner old stocks of silver, Manila dollars, etc., were called into\r\nservice--though the stage was not reached, as it was in Germany, where\r\nit became necessary to melt down silver plate and ornaments. The silver\r\nused for exchange and export was to be replaced by the purchase of\r\nbullion from American producers at $1 per ounce, and its coining into\r\nnew dollars. A minimum price of $1 per ounce was thus established for\r\nsilver bullion.\r\n\r\nThe immediate result was to increase the price of silver at the mine;\r\nbut with the continued rise in demands for silver, the price in the open\r\nmarket went far above this figure, the maximum being reached in 1920\r\nwhen the price of silver went to $1.39 per ounce. Naturally, but little\r\nsilver was then offered to the government at the fixed price of $1 under\r\nthe Pittman Act. With the more recent slump in the general market for\r\nsilver to a price below $1, offers to the government under the Pittman\r\nAct have been renewed.\r\n\r\nThat part of the silver production which is a by-product of copper\r\nproduction has been low since the war, because of the stagnation in the\r\ncopper industry. The production from lead ores, on the other hand, was\r\nnot handicapped by lack of demand for lead. With the restoration of\r\norder in Mexico, a presumption of large silver production in that\r\ncountry may be expected. Increases may probably be expected also from\r\nnew mines in Burma and from Bolivia. On the whole, no large increase in\r\nworld production can be assumed from present known resources. New\r\ndiscoveries will be necessary to make any considerable change.\r\n\r\nOf the mine production of silver in the United States, about two-thirds\r\nof the total comes from the states of Montana, Utah, Idaho, and Nevada.\r\nOther considerable producers are Colorado, Arizona, California, Alaska,\r\nand New Mexico. All the other states together produce less than 5 per\r\ncent of the total. The most important single districts are the Butte\r\ndistrict of Montana, the Coeur d'Alene district of Idaho, and the\r\nTonopah district of Nevada, supplying respectively about one-fifth,\r\none-eighth, and one-tenth of the country's total silver output.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nThe most important mineral of silver is the sulphide, argentite or\r\n\"silver glance.\" Other minerals which yield a minor percentage of the\r\ntotal silver produced are the silver-antimony sulphides, pyrargyrite or\r\n\"ruby silver,\" stephanite or \"black silver,\" and polybasite; the\r\nsilver-arsenic sulphides, proustite or \"light ruby silver\" and pearcite;\r\nand the silver antimonide, dyscrasite. In the oxide zone the most\r\nabundant minerals are cerargyrite (silver chloride) and native or \"horn\"\r\nsilver. In addition to these definite mineral forms, silver is present\r\nin many ores in an undetermined form in other sulphides, notably in\r\ngalena, sphalerite, and pyrite. Silver differs from gold in that it is\r\nchemically active and forms many stable compounds, of which only the\r\nmore important have been mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe fact that half the world's silver is obtained as a by-product in the\r\nmining of other metals has been referred to. In the United States about\r\na third of the production comes from dry or siliceous ores, over a third\r\nfrom lead and zinc ores, and a fourth to a third from copper ores. A\r\nfraction of 1 per cent of the total is obtained as a by-product of gold\r\nplacers, and all the remainder is won from lode or hard-rock deposits.\r\n\r\nThe general geologic features of the silver-bearing copper and lead\r\nores, and of the dry or siliceous gold and silver ores, have been\r\ndescribed on previous pages. The Philipsburg district has been referred\r\nto in connection with manganese ores, and the Bolivian tin-silver ores\r\nwill be described in connection with tin. We shall consider here only a\r\nfew of the more prominent districts which have been primarily silver\r\nproducers.\r\n\r\nThe Cobalt district of northern Ontario is the most productive silver\r\ndistrict in North America. The ores are found in numerous short, narrow\r\nveins, principally in pre-Cambrian sediments near a thick quartz-diabase\r\nsill. Locally they penetrate the sill. Native silver and various silver\r\nsulphides, arsenides, and antimonides are associated with minerals of\r\ncobalt, nickel, bismuth, lead, and zinc, in a gangue of calcite and some\r\nquartz. The ore is of very high grade. The ore minerals are believed to\r\nhave been deposited by hot solutions emanating from deep magmatic\r\nsources after the intrusion of the diabase. The present oxidized zone is\r\nvery shallow, but may have been deeper before being stripped off by\r\nglaciation; it is characterized by native silver and arsenates of nickel\r\nand cobalt in the form of the green \"nickel bloom\" and the pink \"cobalt\r\nbloom.\" The silver minerals are distinctly later in origin than the\r\ncobalt and nickel in the unoxidized zone, as evidenced by the relations\r\nof the mineral individuals when seen under the microscope. This fact,\r\ntogether with the abundance of native silver in the oxide zone, has\r\nsuggested downward concentration of the silver by surface waters; but\r\nrecent studies have indicated the probability that some of the silver at\r\nleast was deposited by the later ascending solutions of magmatic origin.\r\n\r\nIn the Tintic district of central Utah, Paleozoic limestones have been\r\nintruded by monzonite (an acid granitic or porphyritic igneous rock),\r\nand covered by surface flows, the flows for the most part having been\r\nremoved by subsequent erosion. The sediments have been much folded and\r\nfaulted, and the ore bodies occur as fissure veins which locally widen\r\ninto chimneys or pipes in fracture zones, accompanied by much\r\nreplacement of limestone. There is a rough zonal arrangement of the ore\r\nminerals around the intrusive, gold and copper minerals (chiefly\r\nenargite and chalcopyrite) being more prominent near the intrusive, and\r\nargentiferous galena and zinc blende richer at greater distances. Silver\r\nconstitutes the principal value. The gangue is mainly fine-grained\r\nquartz or jasperoid, and barite. The water table is at unusually great\r\ndepths (2,400 feet) and there is a correspondingly deep oxidized zone,\r\nwhich is characterized by lead and zinc oxide minerals much as at\r\nLeadville (p. 219).\r\n\r\nThe Comstock Lode at Virginia City, Nevada, on the east slope of the\r\nSierra Nevadas, was one of the most famous bonanza deposits of gold and\r\nsilver in the world. While the richer ore has all been extracted,\r\nlower-grade material is still being mined and the fissure is still being\r\nfollowed, in the hope of some day striking another fabulously rich ore\r\nbody. The lode occupies a fault fissure parallel to the trend of the\r\nrange and dipping about 40 degrees to the east, which can be traced\r\nabout two and a half miles along the strike, with igneous rocks forming\r\nboth hanging and foot walls. There are no sedimentary rocks in the\r\ndistrict. The high-grade part of the vein is several hundred feet in\r\nthickness, with many irregular branches; the great thickness has been\r\nthought to be at least in part due to the tremendous pressure exerted by\r\ngrowing quartz crystals. The wall rocks have undergone a \"propylitic\"\r\nalteration, with development of chlorite, epidote, and probably\r\nsericite, much as at Butte. The ore contains rich silver sulphide\r\nminerals and native gold, in a gangue composed almost entirely of\r\nquartz. The ore was doubtless formed by hot solutions, but the exact\r\nnature of these solutions, whether magmatic or meteoric, has not been\r\nproven. The hypothesis was early developed that the ores were deposited\r\nby surface waters,--which are supposed to have fallen on the summits of\r\nthe Sierra Nevadas, to have sunk to great depths where they were heated,\r\nenabling them to pick up metallic constituents from the diabase forming\r\none wall of the ore body, and to have risen under artesian pressure\r\nalong the fault plane, where loss of heat and pressure resulted in\r\ndeposition. Later studies have emphasized the similarity of the\r\nore-depositing conditions with those in other districts where the ores\r\nare believed to have come directly from magmatic sources, and this\r\norigin is now generally favored for the Comstock Lode. However, the\r\nearlier theory has not been disproved.\r\n\r\nThe Tonopah, Nevada, district is very similar to the Goldfield district\r\n(p. 230). Silver and gold are found in veins and replacements in a\r\nseries of Tertiary volcanic flows and tuffs, all of which have been\r\ncomplexly faulted. Silver is the dominant constituent of value. The\r\nformation of fissures and faults accompanying and caused by the\r\nintrusion and cooling of lavas was first clearly shown in this district.\r\nEvidences of origin through the work of hot solutions, probably\r\nmagmatic, are the close association of the ores in place and in time\r\nwith the igneous rocks--ore deposition in most of the flows having taken\r\nplace before the next overlying flows were put down,--the presence of\r\nfluorine, the nature of the wall-rock alterations, the fact that both\r\nhot and cold springs are found close together underground (indicating\r\nunusual sources for the hot springs), the contrast in composition\r\nbetween the ores and the country rock, and the general relation of these\r\nores to a large number of similar occurrences in Tertiary lavas in the\r\nsame general area.\r\n\r\nUnder weathering conditions, the silver sulphide minerals in general are\r\noxidized to form native silver and cerargyrite, which are relatively\r\ninsoluble and remain for the most part in the oxide zone. Silver is less\r\nsoluble than copper and zinc, but more soluble than gold; and to some\r\nextent it is removed in solution, particularly where the oxidation of\r\npyrite forms ferric sulphate. Farther down it may be reprecipitated as\r\nnative silver, argentite, and the sulpho-salts, by organic matter or by\r\nvarious sulphides. The secondarily enriched ores are in a few districts,\r\nas at Philipsburg, Montana, the most valuable portions of the deposits.\r\nIn other cases, sulphide enrichment does not appear to have contributed\r\ngreatly to the values. The zones of oxide ores, secondary sulphide ores,\r\nand primary or protores are in most silver deposits much less regular\r\nand much less definitely marked than in the case of copper ores.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATINUM ORES\r\n\r\n\r\nECONOMIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nThe principal uses of platinum are: as a catalytic agent in the contact\r\nprocess for the manufacture of sulphuric acid, and in the making of\r\nnitric acid from ammonia; for chemical laboratory utensils that must be\r\nresistant to heat and acids; for electrical contacts for certain\r\ntelephone, telegraph, and electrical control instruments, and for\r\ninternal combustion engines; in dental work; and for jewelry. In normal\r\ntimes before the war, it is estimated that in the United States the\r\njewelry and dental industries used 75 per cent of the platinum metals\r\nconsumed, the electrical industry 20 per cent, and the chemical industry\r\n5 per cent. During the war, with the extraordinary expansion of\r\nsulphuric and nitric acid plants, these proportions were reversed and\r\nthe chemical and electrical industries consumed about two-thirds of the\r\nplatinum. Substitutes have been developed, particularly for the\r\nelectrical uses, and the demand from this quarter may be expected to\r\ndecrease.\r\n\r\nAbout 90 per cent of the world's crude platinum produced annually comes\r\nfrom the Ural Mountains in Russia. The deposits next in importance are\r\nthose of Colombia. Small amounts are produced in New South Wales,\r\nTasmania, New Zealand, Borneo, British Columbia, United States, India,\r\nand Spain; and as a by-product in the electrolytic refining of the\r\nSudbury, Canada, nickel ores. The extension of this method of refining\r\nto all of the Sudbury ores would create an important supply of platinum.\r\nThe Colombian output has been increasing rapidly since 1911. Meanwhile\r\nthe Russian production has declined; and from the best information\r\navailable, it is not likely that Russia will be able to maintain\r\nproduction for many more years. Estimates of the life of the Russian\r\nfields are from 12 to 20 years at the pre-war rate of production.\r\n\r\nThe platinum situation is commercially controlled by buying and\r\nmine-operating agencies,--the French having, before the war, practically\r\ndominated the Russian industry, while American interests controlled in\r\nColombia. The situation is further influenced by four large refineries,\r\nin England, Germany, United States, and France.\r\n\r\nBefore the war the United States produced less than 1 per cent of the\r\nnew platinum it consumed annually. Production comes principally from\r\nCalifornia, with smaller amounts from Oregon, Alaska, and Nevada. The\r\nmany efforts which have been made to develop an adequate domestic supply\r\nof this metal do not indicate that the United States can ever hope to\r\nbecome independent of foreign sources for its future supplies of\r\nplatinum.\r\n\r\nThere is little reason to doubt that the Colombia field, commercially\r\ndominated by the United States, holds great promise for the future. The\r\noutput has come largely from native hand labor, and with the\r\ninstallation of dredges can probably be greatly increased.\r\n\r\nDuring the war, the need for platinum for war manufactures was so urgent\r\nand the production so reduced, that restrictions against its use in\r\njewelry were put into force in all the allied countries. The United\r\nStates government secured quantities of platinum which would have been\r\nsufficient for several years' use if war had continued. With the\r\ncessation of hostilities restrictions on the use of platinum were\r\nremoved, and the accumulated metal was released by the government from\r\ntime to time in small quantities; but the demands for platinum in the\r\narts were so great that prices for a time tended to even higher levels\r\nthan during the war. More recently supply is again approaching demand.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nPlatinum, like gold, occurs chiefly as the native metal. This is usually\r\nfound alloyed with iron and with other metals of the platinum group,\r\nespecially iridium, rhodium, and palladium. Most of the platinum as used\r\nin jewelry and for electrical purposes contains iridium, which serves to\r\nharden it. Paladium-gold alloys are a substitute for platinum, chiefly\r\nin dental uses.\r\n\r\nThe original home of platinum is in basic igneous rocks, such as\r\nperidotites, pyroxenites, and dunites, where it has been found in small,\r\nscattered crystals intergrown with olivine, pyroxene, and chromite.\r\nPlatinum is very dense and highly resistant to oxidation and solution.\r\nIn the breaking up and washing away of the rocks, therefore, it is\r\nconcentrated in small grains and scales in stream and beach placers. Of\r\nthe world production of platinum over 99 per cent has been derived from\r\nplacers.\r\n\r\nThe Ural Mountain deposits of Russia are gold- and platinum-bearing\r\nplacers, in streams which drain areas of dunite rock containing minute\r\nquantities of native platinum. The deposits of Colombia and Australasia\r\nare placers of a similar character. In the United States small\r\nquantities of platinum are recovered from the gold-bearing gravels of\r\nCalifornia and Oregon, where the streams have come from areas of\r\nserpentine and peridotite.\r\n\r\nA platinum arsenide, called sperrylite, is sometimes found associated\r\nwith sulphide minerals in basic igneous rocks. At Sudbury, Ontario, this\r\nmineral, together with palladium arsenide, is found in the nickel ores,\r\nespecially in the weathered zone where it is concentrated by removal of\r\nmore soluble materials. It has also been found in the copper mines of\r\nRambler, Wyoming. In the Yellow Pine district of southern Nevada,\r\nmetallic gold-platinum-palladium ore shoots are found in association\r\nwith copper and lead ores, in a fine-grained quartz mass which replaces\r\nbeds of limestone near a granitic dike. No basic intrusives are known\r\nin the district. The deposit is unusual in that it has a comparatively\r\nhigh content of platinum (nearly an ounce to the ton), and is probably\r\ngenetically related to acid intrusives. From all these deposits, only\r\nsmall quantities of platinum are mined.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[34] Report of a joint committee appointed from the Bureau of Mines and\r\nthe United States Geological Survey by the Secretary of the Interior to\r\nstudy the gold situation: _Bull. 144, U.

Over\r\nthree-fourths of the world's bauxite production and 65 per cent of the\r\nUnited States production is used for the manufacture of aluminum. On an\r\naverage six tons of bauxite are required to make one ton of metallic\r\naluminum. Other important uses of bauxite are in the manufacture of\r\nartificial abrasives in the electric furnace, and in the preparation of\r\nalum, aluminum sulphate, and other chemicals which are used for\r\nwater-purification, tanning, and dyeing. Relatively small but\r\nincreasingly important quantities are used in making bauxite brick or\r\nhigh alumina refractories for furnace-linings.\r\n\r\nAluminum is used principally in castings and drawn and pressed ware, for\r\npurposes in which lightness, malleability, and unalterability under\r\nordinary chemical reagents are desired. Thus it is used in parts of\r\nairplane and automobile engines, in household utensils, and recently in\r\nthe framework of airplanes. Aluminum wire has been used as a substitute\r\nfor copper wire as an electrical conductor. Aluminum is used in\r\nmetallurgy to remove oxygen from iron and steel, and also in the\r\nmanufacture of alloys. Powdered aluminum is used for the production of\r\nhigh temperatures in the Thermite process, and is a constituent of the\r\nexplosive, ammonal, and of aluminum paints.\r\n\r\nDeposits of bauxite usually contain as impurities silica (in the form of\r\nkaolin or hydrous aluminum silicate), iron oxide, and titanium minerals,\r\nin varying proportions. Bauxites to be of commercial grade should carry\r\nat least 50 per cent alumina, and for the making of aluminum should be\r\nlow in silica though the content of iron may be fairly high. For\r\naluminum chemicals materials low in iron and titanium are preferred; and\r\nfor refractories which must withstand high temperatures, low iron\r\ncontent seems to be necessary. The abrasive trade in general uses\r\nlow-silica high-iron bauxites.\r\n\r\nThe only large producers of bauxite are the United States and France,\r\nwhich supplied in normal times before the war over 95 per cent of the\r\nworld's total. Small amounts are produced in Ireland, Italy, India, and\r\nBritish Guiana. During the war a great deal of low-grade bauxite was\r\nmined in Austria-Hungary and possibly in Germany; but on account of the\r\nlarge reserves of high-grade material in other parts of the world, it is\r\ndoubtful whether these deposits will be utilized in the future. Bauxites\r\nof good grade have been reported from Africa, Australia, and many\r\nlocalities in India. From geologic considerations it is practically\r\ncertain that there are very large quantities available for the future in\r\nsome of these regions.\r\n\r\nThe international movements and the consumption of bauxite are largely\r\ndetermined by the manufacture of aluminum, and to a lesser extent by the\r\nmanufacture of abrasives and chemicals. The principal foreign producers\r\nof aluminum are France, Switzerland (works partly German-owned), Norway\r\n(works controlled by English and French capital), England, Canada,\r\nItaly, Germany, and Austria. French bauxite has normally supplied the\r\nentire European demands,--with the exceptions that Italy procures part\r\nof her requirements at home, and that the Irish deposits furnish a small\r\nfraction of the English demand.\r\n\r\nThe deposits of southern France, controlled largely by French but in\r\npart by British capital, have large reserves and will probably continue\r\nto meet the bulk of European requirements. France also has important\r\nreserves of bauxite in French Guiana.\r\n\r\nThe United States produces about half of the aluminum of the world, and\r\nis the largest manufacturer of artificial abrasives and probably of\r\naluminum chemicals. Most of these are made from domestic bauxite. Prior\r\nto the war, the United States imported about 10 per cent of the bauxite\r\nconsumed, but these imports were mainly high-grade French bauxite which\r\ncertain makers of chemicals preferred to the domestic material. The\r\nsmall production of Guiana is also imported into the United States.\r\nBauxite is exported to Canadian makers of aluminum and abrasives.\r\nDuring the war period domestic deposits were entirely capable of\r\nsupplying all the domestic as well as Canadian demands for bauxite,\r\nalthough these demands increased to two and one-half times their\r\nprevious figure. At the same time considerable amounts of manufactured\r\naluminum products were exported to Europe, whereas aluminum had\r\npreviously been imported from several European countries.\r\n\r\nThe United States production of bauxite comes mainly from Arkansas, with\r\nsmaller amounts from Tennessee, Alabama, and Georgia. The reserves are\r\nlarge but are not inexhaustible. Most of the important deposits are\r\ncontrolled by the large consumers of bauxite, principally the Aluminum\r\nCompany of America and its subsidiaries, though certain chemical and\r\nabrasive companies own some deposits. The Aluminum Company of America\r\nalso controls immense deposits of high-grade bauxite in Dutch and\r\nBritish Guiana, and further exploration by American interests is under\r\nway.\r\n\r\nWith the return to normal conditions since the war, some of the domestic\r\nbauxite deposits probably can not be worked at a profit, a situation\r\nwhich is likely to require the development of the tropical American\r\ndeposits.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nAluminum is the third most abundant element in the common rocks and is\r\nan important constituent of most rock minerals; but in its usual\r\noccurrence it is so closely locked up in chemical combinations that the\r\nmetal cannot be extracted on a commercial scale. In the crystalline form\r\naluminum oxide constitutes some of the most valuable gem stones. Many\r\nordinary clays and shales contain 25 to 35 per cent alumina\r\n(Al_{2}O_{3}), and the perfection of a process for their utilization\r\nwould make available almost unlimited aluminum supplies. The principal\r\nminerals from which aluminum is recovered today are hydrous aluminum\r\noxides, the most prominent of which are bauxite, gibbsite, and\r\ndiaspore--the aggregate of all these minerals going commercially under\r\nthe name of bauxite.\r\n\r\nPrior to the discovery of bauxite ores, cryolite, a sodium-aluminum\r\nfluoride obtained from pegmatites in Greenland, was the chief source of\r\naluminum. It is only within about the last thirty-five years that\r\nbauxite has been used and that aluminum has become an important material\r\nof modern industry. Cryolite is used today to form a molten bath in\r\nwhich the bauxite is electrolytically reduced to aluminum.\r\n\r\nBauxite deposits in general are formed by the ordinary katamorphic\r\nprocesses of surface weathering, when acting on the right kind of rocks\r\nand carried to an extreme. In the weathering of ordinary rocks the bases\r\nare leached out and carried away, leaving a porous mass of clay (hydrous\r\naluminum silicates), quartz, and iron oxide. In the weathering of rocks\r\nhigh in alumina, and low in iron minerals and quartz, deposits of\r\nresidual clay or kaolin nearly free from iron oxide and quartz are\r\nformed. Under ordinary weathering conditions the kaolin is stable; but\r\nunder favorable conditions, such as obtain in the weathered zones of\r\ntropical climates, it is broken up, the silica is taken into solution\r\nand carried away, and hydrous aluminum oxides remain as bauxite ores.\r\nThis extreme type of weathering is sometimes called lateritic alteration\r\n(see pp. 172-173). Impurities of the bauxite ores are the small\r\nquantities of iron and titanium present in the original rocks, together\r\nwith the kaolin which has not been broken up. The deposits usually form\r\nshallow blankets over considerable areas, with irregular lower surfaces\r\ndetermined by the action of surface waters--which work most effectively\r\nwhere joints or other conditions favor the maximum circulation and\r\nalteration. A certain degree of porosity in the original rock is also\r\nknown to favor the alteration. A complete gradation from the unaltered\r\nrock through clay to the high-grade bauxite, with progressive decrease\r\nin bases and silica, concentration of alumina and iron oxide, and\r\nincrease of moisture and pore space, is frequently evident (see Fig.\r\n13). The bauxite is earthy, and usually shows a concretionary or\r\npisolitic structure similar to that observed in residual iron ores (p.\r\n172). Near the surface there may be an increase in silica,--probably due\r\nto a reversal of the usual conditions by a slight leaching of alumina,\r\nthus concentrating the denser masses of kaolin which have not been\r\ndecomposed.\r\n\r\nThe Arkansas bauxite deposits, the most important in the United States,\r\nare surface deposits overlying nepheline-syenite, an igneous rock with\r\na high ratio of alumina to iron content. The most valuable deposits are\r\nresidual, and some parts have preserved the texture of the original\r\nrock, though with great increase in pore space; most of the ore,\r\nhowever, has the typical pisolitic structure. Near the surface the\r\npisolites are sometimes loosened by weathering, yielding a gravel ore,\r\nand some of the material has been transported a short distance to form\r\ndetrital ores interstratified with sands and gravels. The complete\r\ngradation from syenite to bauxite has been shown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13. Diagram showing gradation from syenite\r\nto bauxite in terms of volume. The columns represent a series of samples\r\nfrom a single locality in Arkansas. After Mead.]\r\n\r\nIn the Appalachian region of Tennessee, Alabama, and Georgia, bauxite\r\noccurs as pockets in residual clays above sedimentary rocks, chiefly\r\nabove shales and dolomites. Its origin has probably been similar to that\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\nThe bauxite deposits of southern France occur in folded limestones, and\r\nhave been ascribed by French writers to the work of ascending hot waters\r\ncarrying aluminum sulphate. They present some unusual features, and\r\nevidence as to their origin is not conclusive.\r\n\r\nAt the present time bauxite is doubtless forming in tropical climates,\r\nwhere conditions are favorable for deep and extreme weathering of the\r\nlateritic type. The breaking up of kaolin accompanied by the removal of\r\nsilica is not characteristic of temperate climates, though many clays in\r\nthese climates show some bauxite. It is possible that, at the time when\r\nthe bauxite deposits of Arkansas and other temperate regions were\r\nformed, the climate of these places was warmer than it is today.\r\n\r\nIn studying the origin of bauxites, it should not be overlooked that\r\nthey have much in common with clays, certain iron ores, and many other\r\ndeposits formed by weathering.\r\n\r\n\r\nANTIMONY ORES\r\n\r\n\r\nECONOMIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nAntimony is used mainly for alloying with other metals. Over one-third\r\nof the antimony consumed in the United States is alloyed with tin and\r\ncopper in the manufacture of babbitt or bearing-metal. Other important\r\nalloys include type-metal (lead, antimony, and tin), which has the\r\nproperty of expanding on solidification; \"hard lead,\" a lead-antimony\r\nalloy used in making acid-resisting valves; Britannia or white metal\r\n(antimony, tin, copper, zinc), utilized for cheap domestic tableware;\r\nand some brasses and bronzes, solders, aluminum alloys, pattern metals,\r\nand materials for battery plates and cable coverings. Antimony finds a\r\nvery large use in war times in the making of shrapnel bullets from\r\nantimonial lead. Antimony oxides are used in white enameling of metal\r\nsurfaces, as coloring agents in the manufacture of glass, and as paint\r\npigments; the red sulphides are used in vulcanizing and coloring rubber,\r\nas paint pigments, in percussion caps, and in safety matches; and other\r\nsalts find a wide variety of minor uses in chemical industries and in\r\nmedicine.\r\n\r\nAntimony ores vary greatly in grade, the Chinese ores carrying from 20\r\nto 64 per cent of the metal. The presence of arsenic and copper in the\r\nores is undesirable. Several of the more important antimony districts\r\nowe their economical production of that metal to the presence of\r\nrecoverable values in gold. Some lead-silver ores contain small\r\nquantities of antimony, and \"antimonial lead,\" containing 12 to 18 per\r\ncent antimony, is recovered in their smelting.\r\n\r\nChina is by far the most important antimony-producing country in the\r\nworld, and normally supplies over half the world's total. Chinese\r\nantimony is exported in part as antimony crude (lumps of needle-like\r\nantimony sulphide), and in part as antimony regulus, which is about 99\r\nper cent pure metal. France was the only other important source of\r\nantimony before the war (25 to 30 per cent of the world production), and\r\nMexico and Hungary produced small amounts. The large demand for antimony\r\noccasioned by the war, besides stimulating production in these\r\ncountries, brought forth important amounts of antimony ore from Algeria\r\n(French control) and from Bolivia and Australia (British control), as\r\nwell as smaller quantities from several other countries. Of the\r\nwar-developed sources, only Algeria and perhaps Australia are expected\r\nto continue production under normal conditions.\r\n\r\nBefore the war, antimony was smelted chiefly in China, England, and\r\nFrance, and to a lesser extent in Germany. British and French commercial\r\nand smelting interests dominated to a considerable extent the world\r\nsituation, and London was the principal antimony market of the world.\r\n\r\nDuring the war Chinese antimony interests were greatly strengthened, and\r\nfacilities for treating the ore in that country were increased. Japan\r\nalso became important as a smelter and marketer of Chinese ore, and\r\nincreasing quantities of antimony were exported from China and Japan\r\ndirectly to the United States. English exports ceased entirely and were\r\nreplaced in this country by Chinese and Japanese brands.\r\n\r\nThe United States normally consumes about one-third of the world's\r\nantimony. Before the war the entire amount was secured by importation,\r\ntwo-thirds from Great Britain and the rest from the Orient, France, and\r\nother European countries. Domestic production of ore and smelting of\r\nforeign ores were negligible. (These statements refer only to the purer\r\nforms of antimony; the United States normally produces considerable\r\namounts of antimonial lead, equivalent to somewhat less than 5 per cent\r\nof the country's total lead production, but this material cannot be\r\nsubstituted for antimony regulus in most of its uses.)\r\n\r\nDuring the war, under the stimulus of rising prices, mining of antimony\r\nwas undertaken in the United States and several thousand tons of metal\r\nwere produced--principally from Nevada, with smaller amounts from\r\nAlaska, California, and other western states. The great demands for\r\nantimony, however, were met chiefly by increased importation. Imports\r\nwere mainly of regulus from Chinese and Japanese smelters of Chinese\r\nantimony; but about a third was contained in ores, including most of the\r\nproduction of Mexico which had formerly gone to England, and about 15\r\nper cent of the Bolivian output. Antimony smelters were developed in the\r\nUnited States to handle these ores.\r\n\r\nAt the close of hostilities there had accumulated in the United States\r\nlarge surplus stocks of antimony and antimonial materials. With a very\r\ndull market and low prices, domestic mines and smelters were obliged to\r\nclose down. The dependence of the United States on foreign sources of\r\nantimony and the importance of the metal for war purposes led to some\r\nagitation for a protective tariff--in addition to the present import\r\nduty of 10 per cent on antimony metal--in order to encourage home\r\nproduction (see pp. 365-366, 393-394).\r\n\r\nIn summary, the United States is almost entirely dependent upon outside\r\nsources for its antimony, although there are inadequately known reserves\r\nin this country which might be exploited if prices were maintained at a\r\nhigh level. The future of United States smelters is problematical.\r\nChina, the world's chief source of antimony, at present dominates the\r\nmarket in this country, largely due to the low cost of production and\r\nfavorable Japanese freight rates.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nThe antimony sulphide, stibnite, is the source of most of the world's\r\nproduction of this metal. Antimony oxides, including senarmontite,\r\ncervantite, and others, are formed near the surface, and in some of the\r\ndeposits of Mexico and Algeria they supply a large part of the values\r\nrecovered. Jamesonite, bournonite, and tetrahedrite (sulphantimonides of\r\nlead and copper), when found in lead-silver deposits, are to some extent\r\na source of antimony in the form of antimonial lead.\r\n\r\nStibnite is found in a variety of associations and is present in small\r\nquantities in many types of deposits. In the commercial antimony\r\ndeposits, it is in most cases accompanied by minor quantities of other\r\nmetallic sulphides--pyrite, cinnabar, sphalerite, galena, arsenopyrite,\r\netc.--in a gangue of quartz and sometimes calcite. Many of the deposits\r\ncontain recoverable amounts of gold and silver.\r\n\r\nThe deposits of the Hunan Province of southern China occur as seams,\r\npockets, and bunches of stibnite ore in gently undulating beds of\r\nfaulted and fissured dolomitic limestone. In the vicinity of the most\r\nimportant mines no igneous rocks have been observed, and the origin of\r\nthe ores has not been worked out.\r\n\r\nIn the Central Plateau of France the numerous antimony deposits are\r\nstibnite veins cutting granites and the surrounding schists and\r\nsediments. An origin related in some way to hot ascending solutions\r\nseems probable.\r\n\r\nThe deposits of the National district of western Nevada, the most\r\nimportant war-developed antimony deposits of the United States, consist\r\nof stibnite veins with a gangue of fine-grained drusy quartz, cutting\r\nthrough flows of rhyolite and basalt. They are intimately related to\r\ncertain gold- and silver-bearing veins, and all are closely associated\r\nwith dikes of rhyolite, which were the feeders to the latest extrusion\r\nin the district. The wall rocks have undergone alteration of the\r\npropylitic type. These relations, and the presence of the mercury\r\nsulphide, cinnabar, in some of the ores (see pp. 258-259), suggest an\r\norigin through the work of ascending hot waters or hot springs. These\r\nwaters probably derived their dissolved matter from a magmatic source,\r\nand worked up along vents near the rhyolite dikes soon after the\r\neruption of this rock.\r\n\r\nIn the weathering of antimony deposits, the stibnite usually alters to\r\nform insoluble white or yellowish oxides, which are sometimes called\r\n\"antimony ocher.\" These tend to accumulate in the oxide zone through the\r\nremoval of the more soluble accompanying minerals. Secondary sulphide\r\nenrichment of antimony deposits, if it occurs at all, is negligible.\r\n\r\n\r\nARSENIC ORES\r\n\r\n\r\nECONOMIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nAbout two-thirds of the arsenic consumed in recent years has been used\r\nin agriculture, where various arsenic compounds--arsenic trioxide or\r\n\"white arsenic,\" Paris green, lead arsenate, etc.--are used as\r\ninsecticides and weed killers. Arsenic compounds are also used in\r\n\"cattle-dips\" for killing vermin. The only other large use of arsenic is\r\nin the glass industry, arsenic trioxide being added to the molten glass\r\nto purify and decolorize the product. Small quantities of arsenic\r\ncompounds are used in the preparation of drugs and dyeing materials, and\r\nmetallic arsenic is used for hardening lead in shot-making.\r\n\r\nThe principal arsenic-producing countries are the United States,\r\nGermany, France, Great Britain, Canada, and Mexico. Spain, Portugal,\r\nJapan, and China are also producers, and recent trouble with the\r\n\"prickly-pear\" pest in Queensland, Australia, has led to local\r\ndevelopment of arsenic mining in that country. For the most part,\r\nEuropean production has been used in Europe and American production in\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nArsenic is recovered almost wholly as a by-product of smelting ores for\r\nthe metals. The potential supply is ample in most countries where\r\nsmelting is conducted, but owing to the elaborate plant required to\r\nrecover the arsenic, apparatus is not usually installed much in advance\r\nof the demand for production. Rapid expansion is not possible.\r\n\r\nBefore the war the arsenic needs of the United States (chiefly\r\nagricultural) were supplied by a few recovery plants in the United\r\nStates, Mexico, and Canada. Several large smelters had not found it\r\nprofitable to install recovery plants, as the market might have been\r\noversupplied and prices were low. During the war, with the extensive\r\ndemand for insecticides for gardening, there was a considerable\r\ndeficiency of arsenic supplies. With rising prices production was\r\nstimulated, but was still unable to meet the increased demand. This\r\nsituation resulted in regulation of the prices of white arsenic by the\r\nFood Administration.\r\n\r\nProduction of arsenic in the United States comes chiefly from smelters\r\nin Colorado, Washington, Utah, Montana, and New Jersey. Small amounts\r\nare produced by arsenic mines in Virginia and New York. A Mexican plant\r\nat Mapimi has been shipping important quantities to the United States.\r\nThe plant at Anaconda, Montana, is expected to produce an ample supply\r\nin the future.\r\n\r\nThe United States is entirely independent in arsenic supplies and will\r\nprobably soon have an exportable surplus. Export trade, after the\r\nreconstruction period, will probably meet competition from France and\r\nGermany where production was formerly large.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nArsenic-bearing minerals are numerous and rather widely distributed, but\r\nonly a few of them are mined primarily for their content of arsenic.\r\nArsenopyrite or \"mispickle\" (iron-arsenic sulphide) has been used\r\nintermittently as a source of white arsenic in various places,--notably\r\nat Brinton, Virginia, and near Carmel, New York. The former deposits\r\ncontain arsenopyrite and copper-bearing pyrite impregnating a\r\nmica-quartz-schist, adjacent to and in apparent genetic relation with\r\naplite or pegmatite intrusives. In the latter locality arsenopyrite is\r\nfound associated with pyrite in a gangue of quartz, forming a series of\r\nparallel stringers in gneiss close to a basic dike.\r\n\r\nThe orange-red sulphides of arsenic, orpiment and realgar, are formed\r\nboth as primary minerals of igneous source and as secondary products of\r\nweathering. They are rather characteristic of the oxide zones of certain\r\narsenical metallic ores, and are believed in many cases to have formed\r\nfrom arsenopyrite. They are mined on a commercial scale in China.\r\n\r\nThe great bulk of the world's arsenic, as previously stated, is obtained\r\nas a by-product of smelting operations. The enargite of the Butte copper\r\nores (pp. 201-203) contains a considerable amount of arsenic, a large\r\npart of which will be recovered from the smelter fumes by new processes\r\nwhich are being installed. The gold-silver ores of the Tintic district\r\n(pp. 235) also yield important amounts, the arsenic-bearing minerals\r\nbeing enargite and tennantite (copper-arsenic sulphides) and others. The\r\nsilver ores of the Cobalt district of Ontario (pp. 234-235), containing\r\nnickel and cobalt arsenides, produce considerable arsenic. Many other\r\nmetallic ores contain notable amounts of arsenic, which are at present\r\nallowed to escape through smelter flues, but which could be recovered\r\nunder market conditions which would repay the cost of installing the\r\nnecessary apparatus.\r\n\r\n\r\nBISMUTH ORES\r\n\r\n\r\nECONOMIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nBismuth metal is used in alloys, to which it gives low fusibility\r\ncombined with hardness and sharp definition. Bismuth alloys are employed\r\nin automatic fire sprinklers, in safety plugs for boilers, in electric\r\nfuses, in solders and dental amalgams, and in some type and bearing\r\nmetals. Bismuth salts find a considerable application for pharmaceutical\r\npurposes, especially in connection with intestinal disorders, and the\r\nbest grades of bismuth materials are used for this purpose. The salts\r\nare also used in porcelain painting and enameling and in staining glass.\r\n\r\nBolivia is the most important producer of bismuth ore. The output is\r\ncontrolled entirely by British smelting interests. An important deposit\r\nexists in Peru, the output of which is limited by the same British\r\nsyndicate. Considerable bismuth is produced in Australia, Tasmania, and\r\nNew Zealand, all of which likewise goes to England. Germany before the\r\nwar had three smelters which produced bismuth from native ores in\r\nSaxony; bismuth was one of the few metals of which Germany had an\r\nadequate domestic supply. Recently southern China is reported to be\r\nmining increasing amounts of bismuth.\r\n\r\nThe United States produces the larger part of its bismuth requirements,\r\nchiefly from plants installed at two lead refineries. A further\r\ninstallation would make this country entirely independent of foreign\r\nsupplies if occasion required. Imports, from England and South America,\r\nhave been steadily declining, but during the war were somewhat\r\nincreased. The United States does not export bismuth so far as known.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nThe principal minerals of bismuth are bismuthinite (bismuth sulphide),\r\nbismutite (hydrated carbonate), bismite or bismuth ocher (hydrated\r\noxide), and native bismuth.\r\n\r\nThe native metal and the sulphide are believed to be formed mainly as\r\nprimary minerals of igneous origin. In the deposits of New South Wales\r\nthey are found associated with molybdenite in quartz gangue, in\r\npipe-like deposits in granite. The oxide and the carbonate are probably\r\nproducts of surface weathering. The Bolivian deposits contain the native\r\nmetal, the oxide, and the carbonate, associated with gold, silver, and\r\ntin minerals, in one locality in slates and in another locality in\r\nporphyry. The origin is not well known.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, the sulphide, bismuthinite, is found in the\r\nsiliceous ores of Goldfield, Nevada (p. 230), and in minor amounts in a\r\ngreat number of the sulphide ores of the Cordilleran region. The ores of\r\nthe Leadville and Tintic districts (pp. 219 and 235) yield the larger\r\npart of the United States production, the bismuth being recovered as\r\nby-product from the electrolytic refining of the lead bullion. Large\r\namounts of bismuth pass out of the stacks of smelters treating other\r\nwestern ores, and while it would not be cheap nor easy to save the\r\nbismuth thus lost, it could probably be done in case of necessity.\r\n\r\n\r\nCADMIUM ORES\r\n\r\n\r\nECONOMIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nCadmium is used in low melting-point alloys--as, for example, those\r\nemployed in automatic fire-extinguishers and electric fuses,--in the\r\nmanufacture of silverware, and in dental amalgams. During the war the\r\ncritical scarcity of tin led to experiments in the substitution of\r\ncadmium for tin in solders and anti-friction metals. Results of some of\r\nthese experiments were promising, but the war ceased and demands for tin\r\ndecreased before the cadmium materials became widely used. Future\r\ndevelopments in this direction seem not unlikely. Cadmium compounds are\r\nused as pigments, particularly as the sulphide \"cadmium yellow,\" and to\r\ngive color and luster to glass and porcelain. Cadmium salts are also\r\nvariously used in the arts, in medicine, and in electroplating.\r\n\r\nPractically the entire cadmium output of the world comes from Germany\r\nand the United States. In addition, England produces a very small\r\nquantity. Before the war Germany produced about two-thirds of the\r\nworld's total, and supplied the European as well as a considerable part\r\nof the United States consumption. During the war the United States\r\nproduction increased three to four fold, imports ceased, and\r\nconsiderable quantities were exported to the allied nations in Europe\r\nand to Japan. At present the United States is entirely independent as\r\nregards cadmium supplies. Production is sufficient to supply all the\r\nhome demand and to permit exports of one-third of the total output. A\r\nconsiderable number of possible cadmium sources are not being used, and\r\nthe production is capable of extension should the need arise.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nNearly the only cadmium mineral known is the sulphide, greenockite, but\r\nno deposits of this mineral have been found of sufficient volume to be\r\ncalled cadmium ores. Sphalerite almost always contains a little cadmium,\r\nprobably as the sulphide; and in zinc deposits crystals of sphalerite in\r\ncavities are frequently covered with a greenish-yellow film or coating\r\nof greenockite. These coatings have probably been formed by the\r\ndecomposition of cadmium-bearing zinc sulphide in the oxide zone, the\r\ncarrying down of the cadmium in solution, and its precipitation as\r\nsecondary cadmium sulphide. The zinc oxide minerals in the surficial\r\nzone also are sometimes colored yellow by small amounts of greenockite.\r\nIn the zinc ores of the Joplin district of Missouri, cadmium is present\r\nin amounts ranging from a trace to 1 per cent and averaging 0.3 per\r\ncent.\r\n\r\nGermany's cadmium is produced by fractional distillation of the Silesian\r\nzinc ores, which contain at most 0.3 per cent cadmium. In the United\r\nStates there are large potential sources in the zinc ores of the\r\nMississippi valley, and considerable cadmium is recovered in roasting\r\nthem. Much of the American cadmium is also obtained from bag-house dusts\r\nat lead smelters.\r\n\r\nThe general geologic conditions of the cadmium-bearing ores are\r\nindicated in the discussion of lead and zinc deposits in an earlier\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOBALT ORES\r\n\r\n\r\nECONOMIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nCobalt finds its largest use in the form of cobalt salts, employed in\r\ncoloring pottery and glass and in insect poisons. Cobalt is also used in\r\nsome of the best high-speed tool steels. \"Stellite,\" which is used to a\r\nlimited extent in non-rusting tools of various sorts, and in\r\nconsiderable quantity to replace high-speed tool steels, is an alloy of\r\ncobalt, chromium, and small quantities of other metals. Considerable\r\nexperimental work has been done on the properties and uses of cobalt\r\nalloys, and their consumption is rapidly on the increase.\r\n\r\nCobalt is an item of commerce of insignificant tonnage. There are only\r\ntwo countries, Canada (Ontario) and the Belgian Congo, which produce\r\nnoteworthy amounts. The Katanga district in the Congo produces blister\r\ncopper that contains as much as 4 per cent of cobalt, though usually\r\nless than 2 per cent. This product formerly went to Germany, and now\r\ngoes entirely to Great Britain. Just how much cobalt is saved is\r\nunknown, but probably several hundred tons annually. It is probable that\r\nmost of the cobalt in these ores will be lost on the installation of a\r\nleaching process for recovery of the copper. Canada exports most of its\r\nproduct to the United States, though the amount is small. Domestic\r\nproduction in this country has been too small to record. The United\r\nStates has been dependent on imports from Canada.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nThe principal cobalt minerals are smaltite (cobalt arsenide), cobaltite\r\n(cobalt-arsenic sulphide), and linnaeite (cobalt-nickel sulphide). Under\r\nweathering conditions these minerals oxidize readily to form asbolite, a\r\nmixture of cobalt and manganese oxides, and the pink arsenate, erythrite\r\nor \"cobalt bloom.\"\r\n\r\nCobalt minerals are found principally in small quantities disseminated\r\nthrough ores of silver, nickel, and copper. The production of Canada is\r\nobtained mainly as a by-product of the silver ores of the Cobalt\r\ndistrict (described on pp. 234-235), and smaller amounts are recovered\r\nfrom the Sudbury nickel ores (pp. 180-182). The cobalt of Belgian Congo\r\nis obtained from rich oxidized copper ores which impregnate folded\r\nsediments (p. 205).\r\n\r\n\r\nMERCURY (QUICKSILVER) ORES\r\n\r\n\r\nECONOMIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nUses of mercury are characterized by their wide variety and their\r\napplication to very many different phases of modern industry; they will\r\nbe named here in general order of decreasing importance. About one-third\r\nof the mercury consumed in this country goes into the manufacture of\r\ndrugs and chemicals, such as corrosive sublimate, calomel, and glacial\r\nacetic acid. Mercury fulminate is used as a detonator for high\r\nexplosives and to some extent for small-arms ammunition--a use which was\r\nexceedingly important during the war, but is probably of minor\r\nconsequence in normal times. Mercuric sulphide forms the brilliant red\r\npigment, vermilion, and mercuric oxide is becoming increasingly\r\nimportant in anti-fouling marine paint for ship-bottoms. Either as the\r\nmetal or the oxide, mercury is employed in the manufacture of electrical\r\napparatus (batteries, electrolyzers, rectifiers, etc.), and in the\r\nmaking of thermostats, gas governors, automatic sprinklers, and other\r\nmechanical appliances. Mercuric nitrate is used in the fabrication of\r\nfelt hats from rabbits' fur. In the extraction of gold and silver from\r\ntheir ores by amalgamation, large amounts of metallic mercury have been\r\nutilized, but of late years the wide application of the cyanide process\r\nhas decreased this use. Minor uses include the making of certain\r\ncompounds for preventing boiler-scale, of cosmetics, and of dental\r\namalgam.\r\n\r\nThe ores of mercury vary greatly in grade. Spanish ores yield an average\r\nin the neighborhood of 7 per cent, Italian ores 0.9 per cent, and\r\nAustrian ores 0.65 per cent of metallic mercury. In the United States\r\nthe ores of California yield about 0.4 per cent and those of Texas range\r\nfrom about 0.5 to 4 per cent. In almost all cases the ores are treated\r\nin the immediate vicinity of the mines, and fairly pure metal is\r\nobtained by a process of sublimation and condensation. This is usually\r\nmarketed in iron bottles or flasks containing 75 pounds each.\r\n\r\nThe large producers of mercury are, in order of normal importance,\r\nSpain, Italy, Austria, and United States. Mexico, Russia, and all other\r\ncountries produce somewhat less than 5 per cent of the world's total.\r\n\r\nThe largest quicksilver mines of the world are those of Almaden in\r\ncentral Spain, which are owned and operated by the Spanish government.\r\nThis government, after reserving a small amount for domestic use, sells\r\nall the balance of the production through the Rothschilds of London. In\r\naddition British capital controls some smaller mines in northern Spain.\r\nEngland thus largely controls the European commercial situation in this\r\ncommodity, and London is the world's great quicksilver market, where\r\nprices are fixed and whence supplies go to all corners of the globe.\r\nReserves of the Almaden ore bodies are very large. Sufficient ore is\r\nreported to have been developed to insure a future production of at\r\nleast 40,000 metric tons--an amount equivalent to the entire world\r\nrequirements at pre-war rates of consumption for 100 years.\r\n\r\nThe mercury deposits of the Monte Amiata district of central Italy were\r\nin large part dominated by German capital, but during the war were\r\nseized by the Italian government. The mines of Idria, Austria-Hungary,\r\nwere owned by the Austrian government and their ultimate control is at\r\npresent uncertain. Reserves are very large, being estimated at about\r\none-half those of Almaden. Although England has had a considerable\r\ncontrol over the prices and the market for mercury, the Italian and\r\nAustrian deposits have provided a sufficient amount to prevent any\r\nabsolute monopoly. English interests have now secured control of the\r\nItalian production, and it is expected that they will also control the\r\nAustrian production--thus giving England control of something over\r\nthree-fourths of the world's mercury.\r\n\r\nIn the United States about two-thirds of the mercury is produced in the\r\nCoast Range district of California, and most of the remainder in the\r\nTerlingua district of Texas. Smaller quantities come from Nevada,\r\nOregon, and a few other states. The output before the war was normally\r\nslightly in excess of domestic demand and some mercury was exported to\r\nvarious countries. Due to the exhaustion of the richer and more easily\r\nworked deposits, however, production was declining. During the war, with\r\nincreased demands and higher prices, production was stimulated, the\r\nUnited States became the largest mercury-producing country in the world,\r\nand large quantities were exported to help meet the military needs of\r\nEngland and France.\r\n\r\nWith the end of war prices and with high costs of labor and supplies,\r\nproduction in the United States has again declined. Many of the mines\r\nhave passed their greatest yield, and though discovery of new ore bodies\r\nmight revive the industry, production is probably on the down grade.\r\nFuture needs of this country will probably in some part be met by\r\nimports from Spain, Italy, and Austria, where the deposits are richer\r\nand labor is cheaper. This situation has caused much agitation for a\r\ntariff on imports. The present tariff of 10 per cent is not sufficient\r\nto keep out foreign mercury.\r\n\r\nOutside of the United States large changes in distribution of production\r\nof quicksilver are not expected for some time. The reserves of the\r\nEuropean producers are all large and are ample to sustain present output\r\nfor a considerable number of years. It is reported that there will be a\r\nresumption of mining in the once very productive Huancavelica District\r\nof Peru and in Asia Minor, and with restoration of political order there\r\nmay be an increase in output from Mexico and Russia,--but these\r\ndistricts will be subordinate factors in the world situation. On\r\ngeologic grounds, new areas of mercury ores may be looked for in regions\r\nof recent volcanic activity, such as the east coast of Asia, some\r\nislands of Oceania, the shores of the Mediterranean, and the Cordilleras\r\nof North and South America,--but no such areas which are likely to be\r\nproducers on a large scale are now known.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nThe chief mineral of mercury, from which probably over 95 per cent of\r\nthe world's mercury comes, is the brilliant red sulphide, cinnabar.\r\nMinor sources include the black or gray sulphide, metacinnabar, the\r\nnative metal, and the white mercurous chloride, calomel. The ores are\r\ncommonly associated with more or less iron sulphide, and frequently with\r\nthe sulphides of antimony and arsenic, in a gangue consisting largely of\r\nquartz and carbonates (of calcium, magnesium, and iron). The precious\r\nmetals and the sulphides of the base metals are rare.\r\n\r\nMercury deposits are in general related to igneous rocks, and have\r\nassociations which indicate a particular type of igneous activity. They\r\nare not found in magmatic segregations, in pegmatites, nor in veins\r\nwhich have been formed at great depths and under very high temperatures.\r\nOn the contrary, the occurrence of many deposits in recent flows which\r\nhave not been eroded, their general shallow depth (large numbers\r\nextending down only a few hundred feet), and the association of some\r\ndeposits with active hot springs now carrying mercury in solution,\r\nsuggest an origin through the work of ascending hot waters near the\r\nsurface. The mercury minerals are believed to have been carried in\r\nalkaline sulphide solutions. Precipitation from such solutions may be\r\neffected by oxidation, by dilution, by cooling, or by the presence of\r\norganic matter. Being near the surface, it is a natural assumption that\r\nthe waters doing the work were not intensely hot. At Sulphur Bank\r\nSprings, in the California quicksilver belt, deposition of cinnabar by\r\nmoderately hot waters is actually taking place at present; also these\r\nwaters are bleaching the rock in a manner often observed about mercury\r\ndeposits.\r\n\r\nThe Coast Ranges of California contain a great number of mercury\r\ndeposits extending over a belt about 400 miles long. The ore bodies are\r\nin fissured zones in serpentine and Jurassic sediments, and are related\r\nin general to recent volcanic flows. A considerable amount of bituminous\r\nmatter is found in the ores, and is believed to have been an agent in\r\ntheir precipitation.\r\n\r\nThe Terlingua ores of Texas are found in similar fractured zones in\r\nCretaceous shales and limestones associated with surface igneous flows.\r\nThe occurrence of a few ore bodies in vertical shoots in limestone,\r\napparently terminating upward at the base of an impervious shale,\r\nfurnishes an additional argument for their formation by ascending\r\nwaters.\r\n\r\nIn the few deposits (_e. g._, those of Almaden, Spain, and of the deep\r\nmines of New Almaden and New Idria, California,) where there is no such\r\nclear relation to volcanic rocks as generally observed, but where the\r\nores contain the same characteristic set of minerals, it is concluded\r\nthat practically the same processes outlined above have been active in\r\ntheir formation; and that the volcanic source of the hot solutions\r\neither failed to reach the surface or has been removed by erosion. The\r\nsame line of reasoning is carried a step further, and in many\r\ngold-quartz veins in volcanic rocks, where cinnabar and its associated\r\nminerals are present, it is believed that waters of a hot-spring nature\r\nhave again been effective. Thus cinnabar, when taken with its customary\r\nassociations, is regarded as a sort of geologic thermometer.\r\n\r\nIn the weathering of mercury deposits, cinnabar behaves somewhat like\r\nthe corresponding silver sulphide, argentite. In the oxide zone, native\r\nmercury and the chloride, calomel, are formed. In the Texas deposits a\r\nred oxide and a number of oxychlorides are also present. The carrying\r\ndown of the mercury and its precipitation as secondary sulphide may\r\nhave taken place in some deposits, but this process is unimportant in\r\nforming values.\r\n\r\n\r\nTIN ORES\r\n\r\n\r\nECONOMIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nThe largest use of tin is in the manufacture of tin-plate, which is\r\nemployed in containers for food, oil, and other materials. Next in\r\nimportance is its use in the making of solder and of babbitt or bearing\r\nmetal. Tin is also a constituent of certain kinds of brass, bronze, and\r\nother alloys, such as white metal and type metal. Minor uses include the\r\nmaking of tinfoil, collapsible tubes, wire, rubber, and various\r\nchemicals. Tin oxide is used to some extent in white enameling of metal\r\nsurfaces. Roughly a third of the tin consumed within the United States\r\ngoes into tin-plate, a third into solder and babbitt metal, and a third\r\ninto miscellaneous uses.\r\n\r\nThe ores of tin in general contain only small quantities of the metal.\r\nTin has sufficient value to warrant the working of certain placers\r\ncontaining only a half-pound to the cubic yard, although the usual run\r\nis somewhat higher. The tin content of the vein deposits ranges from\r\nabout 1 per cent to 40 per cent, and the average grade is much closer to\r\nthe lower figure.\r\n\r\nGreat Britain has long controlled the world's tin ores, producing about\r\nhalf of the total and controlling additional supplies in other\r\ncountries. The production is in small part in Cornwall, but largely in\r\nseveral British colonies--the Malay States, central and south Africa,\r\nAustralia, and others. The Malay States furnish about a third of the\r\nworld's total. Another third is produced in immediately adjacent\r\ndistricts of the Dutch East Indies, Siam (British control), and China,\r\nand some of the concentrates of these countries are handled by British\r\nsmelters, especially at Singapore.\r\n\r\nTin is easily reduced from its ores and most of the tin is smelted close\r\nto the sources of production. Considerable quantities, however, have\r\ngone to England for treatment. London has been the chief tin market of\r\nthe world, and before the war the larger portion of the tin entering\r\ninternational trade went through this port. During the war a good deal\r\nof the export tin from Straits Settlements was shipped direct to\r\nconsumers rather than via London, but it is not certain how future\r\nshipments may be made.\r\n\r\nSignificant features of the tin situation in recent years have been a\r\ndecline of production in the Malay States, and a large and growing\r\nproduction in Bolivia. Malayan output has decreased because of the\r\nexhaustion of some of the richer and more accessible deposits; certain\r\ngovernmental measures have also had a restrictive effect. Bolivian\r\nproduction now amounts to over a fifth of the world's total and bids\r\nfair to increase. About half the output is controlled by Chilean, and\r\nsmall amounts by American, French, and German interests. A large portion\r\nof the Bolivian concentrates formerly went to Germany for smelting, but\r\nduring the war American smelters were developed to handle part of this\r\nmaterial; large quantities are also smelted in England.\r\n\r\nThe United States produces a small fraction of 1 per cent of the world's\r\ntin, and consumes a third to a half of the total. The production is\r\nmainly from the Seward Peninsula of northwestern Alaska. For American\r\ntin smelters, Bolivia is about the only available source of supplies;\r\nmetallic tin can be obtained from British possessions, but no ore,\r\nexcept by paying a 33-1/3 per cent export tax. The United States exports\r\ntin-plate in large amounts, and in this trade has met strong competition\r\nfrom English and German tin-plate makers.\r\n\r\nA world shortage of tin during the war required a division of available\r\nsupplies through a central international committee. Somewhat later, with\r\nthe removal of certain restrictions on the distribution of tin,\r\nconsiderable quantities which had accumulated in the Orient found their\r\nway into Europe and precipitated a sensational slump in the tin market.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nThe principal mineral of tin is cassiterite (tin oxide). Stannite, a\r\nsulphide of copper, iron, and tin, is found in some of the Bolivian\r\ndeposits but is rare elsewhere.\r\n\r\nAbout two-thirds of the world's tin is obtained from placers and\r\none-third from vein or \"lode\" deposits. Over 90 per cent of the tin of\r\nsoutheastern Asia and Oceania is obtained from placers. Tin placers,\r\nlike placers of gold, platinum, and tungsten, represent concentrations\r\nin stream beds and ocean beaches of heavy, insoluble minerals--in this\r\ncase chiefly cassiterite--which were present in the parent rocks in\r\nmuch smaller quantities, but which have been sorted out by the\r\nclassifying action of running water.\r\n\r\nThe original home of cassiterite is in veins closely related to granitic\r\nrocks. It is occasionally found in pegmatites, as in certain small\r\ndeposits of the Southern Appalachians and the Black Hills of South\r\nDakota, or is present in a typical contact-metamorphic silicated zone in\r\nlimestone, as in some of the deposits of the Seward Peninsula of Alaska.\r\nIn general, however, it is found in well-defined fissure veins in the\r\nouter parts of granitic intrusions and extending out into the\r\nsurrounding rocks. With the cassiterite are often found minerals of\r\ntungsten, molybdenum, and bismuth, as well as sulphides of iron, copper,\r\nlead, and zinc, and in some cases there is evidence of a rough zonal\r\narrangement. The deposits of Cornwall and of Saxony show transitions\r\nfrom cassiterite veins close to the intrusions into lead-silver veins at\r\na greater distance. The gangue is usually quartz, containing smaller\r\namounts of a number of less common minerals--including lithium mica,\r\nfluorite, topaz, tourmaline, and apatite. The wall rocks are usually\r\nstrongly altered and in part are replaced by some of the above minerals,\r\nforming coarse-grained rocks which are called \"greisen.\"\r\n\r\nThe origin of cassiterite veins, in view of their universal association\r\nwith granitic rocks, is evidently related to igneous intrusions. The\r\noccurrence of the veins in distinct fissures in the granite and in the\r\nsurrounding contact-metamorphic zone indicates that the granite had\r\nconsolidated before their formation, and that they represent a late\r\nstage in the cooling. The association with minerals containing fluorine\r\nand boron, and the intense alteration of the wall rocks, indicate that\r\nthe temperature must have been very high. It is probable that the\r\ntemperature was so high as to cause the solutions to be gaseous rather\r\nthan liquid, and that what have been called \"pneumatolytic\" conditions\r\nprevailed; but evidence to decide this question is not at present\r\navailable.\r\n\r\nThe most important deposits of tin in veins are those of Bolivia, some\r\nof which are exceptionally rich. These are found in granitic rocks\r\nforming the core of the high Cordillera Real and in the adjacent\r\nintruded sediments, in narrow fissure veins and broader brecciated zones\r\ncontaining the typical ore and gangue minerals described above, and\r\nalso, in many cases, silver-bearing sulphides (chiefly tetrahedrite).\r\nThere appear to be all gradations in type from silver-free tin ores to\r\ntin-free silver ores, although the extremes are now believed to be rare.\r\nIn the main the tin ores, with abundant tourmaline, appear to be more\r\nclosely related to the coarse-grained granites, and to indicate intense\r\nconditions of heat and pressure, while the more argentiferous ores, with\r\nvery little or no tourmaline, are found in relation to finer-grained\r\nquartz porphyries and even rhyolites, and seem to indicate less intense\r\nconditions at the time of deposition. The ores of the whole area, which\r\nis a few hundred miles long, have been supposed to represent a single\r\ngenetic unit, and the sundry variations are believed to be local facies\r\nof a general mineralization. Processes of secondary enrichment have in\r\nplaces yielded large quantities of oxidized silver minerals and wood tin\r\nnear the surface, with accumulations of ruby silver ores at greater\r\ndepths.\r\n\r\nThe only other vein deposits which are at present of consequence are\r\nthose of Cornwall. Here batholiths of granite have been intruded into\r\nPaleozoic slates and sandstones, and tin ores occur in fissures and\r\nstockworks in the marginal zones. With the exhaustion of the more easily\r\nmined placers, the lode deposits will doubtless be of increasing\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nCassiterite is practically insoluble and is very resistant to\r\ndecomposition by weathering. Oxide zones of tin deposits are therefore\r\nenriched by removal of the more soluble minerals. Stannite probably\r\nalters to \"wood tin,\" a fibrous variety of cassiterite. Secondary\r\nenrichment of tin deposits by redeposition of tin minerals is\r\nnegligible.\r\n\r\n\r\nURANIUM AND RADIUM ORES\r\n\r\n\r\nECONOMIC FEATURES\r\n\r\n\r\nRadium salts are used in various medical treatments--especially for\r\ncancer, internal tumors, lupus, and birth marks--and in luminous paints.\r\nDuring the latter part of the war it is estimated that over nine-tenths\r\nof the radium produced was used in luminous paints for the dials of\r\nwatches and other instruments. In addition part of the material owned by\r\nphysicians was devoted to this purpose, and it is probable that the\r\naccumulated stocks held by the medical profession were in this way\r\nreduced by one-half. The greatly extended use of radium, together with\r\nthe distinctly limited character of the world's known radium supplies,\r\nhas led to some concern; and considerable investigation has been made of\r\nthe possibilities of mesothorium as a substitute for radium in luminous\r\npaints. Low-grade radium residues are used to some extent as\r\nfertilizers.\r\n\r\nUranium has been used as a steel alloy, but has not as yet gained wide\r\nfavor. Uranium salts have a limited use as yellow coloring agents in\r\npottery and glass. The principal use of uranium, however, is as a source\r\nof radium, with which it is always associated.\r\n\r\nEuropean countries first developed the processes of reduction of radium\r\nsalts from their ores. Most of the European ores are obtained from\r\nAustria, where the mines are owned and operated by the Austrian\r\ngovernment, and small quantities are mined in Cornwall, England, and in\r\nGermany. Production is decreasing. The European hospitals and\r\nmunicipalities have acquired nearly all of the production.\r\n\r\nThe United States has the largest reserves of radium ore in the world,\r\nand the American market has in recent years been supplied from domestic\r\nplants. Before the war, radium ores were shipped to Europe for treatment\r\nin Germany, France, and England, and radium salts were imported from\r\nthese countries. There are now radium plants in the United States\r\ncapable of producing annually from domestic ores an amount several times\r\nas large as the entire production of the rest of the world. Practically\r\nall the production has come from Colorado and Utah. Known reserves are\r\nnot believed to be sufficient for more than a comparatively few years'\r\nproduction, but it is not unlikely that additional deposits will be\r\nfound in the same area.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nUranium is one of the rarer metals. Radium is found only in uranium ores\r\nand only in exceedingly small quantities. The maximum amount which can\r\nbe present in a state of equilibrium is about one part of radium in\r\n3,000,000 parts of uranium. The principal sources of uranium and radium\r\nare the minerals carnotite (hydrous potassium-uranium vanadate) and\r\npitchblende or uraninite (uranium oxide).\r\n\r\nThe deposits of Joachimsthal, Bohemia, contain pitchblende, along with\r\nsilver, nickel, and cobalt minerals and other metallic sulphides, in\r\nveins associated with igneous intrusions.\r\n\r\nThe important commercial deposits of Colorado and Utah contain\r\ncarnotite, together with roscoelite (a vanadium mica) and small amounts\r\nof chromium, copper, and molybdenum minerals, as impregnations of\r\nflat-lying Jurassic sandstones. The ores carry up to 35 per cent uranium\r\noxide (though largely below 2 per cent), and from one-third as much to\r\nan equal amount of vanadium oxide. The ore minerals are supposed to have\r\nbeen derived from a thick series of clays and impure sandstones a few\r\nhundred feet above, containing uranium and vanadium minerals widely\r\ndisseminated, and to have been carried downward by surface waters\r\ncontaining sulphates. The ore bodies vary from very small pockets to\r\ndeposits yielding a thousand tons or so, and are found irregularly\r\nthroughout certain particular beds without any special relation to\r\npresent topography or to faults. The association of many of the deposits\r\nwith fossil wood and other carbonaceous material suggests that organic\r\nmatter was an agent in their precipitation, but the exact nature of the\r\nprocess is not clear. In a few places in Utah the beds dip at steep\r\nangles, and the carnotite appears in spots along the outcrops and\r\ngenerally disappears as the outcrops are followed into the hillsides;\r\nthis suggests that the carnotite may be locally redissolved and carried\r\nto the surface by capillary action, forming rich efflorescences. Because\r\nof the nature of the deposits no large amount of ore is developed in\r\nadvance of actual mining; but estimates based on past experience\r\nindicate great potentialities of this region for future production.\r\n\r\nIn eastern Wyoming is a unique deposit of uranium ore in a quartzite\r\nwhich lies between mica-schist and granite. The principal ore mineral is\r\nuranophane, a hydrated calcium-uranium silicate, which is believed to be\r\nan oxidation product of pitchblende. Some of the ore runs as high as 4\r\nper cent uranium oxide, and the ore carries appreciable amounts of\r\ncopper but very little vanadium.\r\n\r\nVery recently radium ores have been discovered in the White Signal\r\nmining district of New Mexico, which was formerly worked for gold,\r\nsilver, copper, and lead. The radium-bearing minerals are torbernite and\r\nautunite (hydrous copper-uranium and calcium-uranium phosphates), and\r\nare found in dark felsite dikes near their intersections with east-west\r\ngold-silver-quartz veins. The possibilities of this district have not\r\nyet been determined.\r\n\r\nPitchblende has been found in gold-bearing veins in Gilpin County,\r\neastern Colorado, and in pegmatite dikes in the Appalachians, but these\r\ndeposits are of no commercial importance. Pitchblende is grayish-black,\r\nopaque, and so lacking in distinctive characteristics that it may\r\nreadily be overlooked; hence future discoveries in various regions would\r\nnot be surprising.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nMISCELLANEOUS NON-METALLIC MINERALS\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURAL ABRASIVES\r\n\r\n\r\nECONOMIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nNatural abrasives are less important commercially in the United States\r\nthan artificial abrasives, but a considerable industry is based on the\r\nnatural abrasives.\r\n\r\nSilica or quartz in its various crystalline forms constitutes over\r\nthree-fourths of the tonnage of natural abrasives used in the United\r\nStates. It is the chief ingredient of sand, sandstone, quartzite, chert,\r\ndiatomaceous earth, and tripoli. From the sand and sandstone are made\r\nmillstones, buhrstones, grindstones, pulpstones, hones, oilstones, and\r\nwhetstones. Sand, sandstone, and quartzite are also ground up and used\r\nin sand-blasts, sandpaper, and for other abrasive purposes. Chert or\r\nflint constitutes grinding pebbles and tube-mill linings, and is also\r\nground up for abrasives. Diatomaceous (infusorial) earth is used as a\r\npolishing agent and also as a filtering medium, an absorbent, and for\r\nheat insulation. Tripoli (and rottenstone) are used in polishing powders\r\nand scouring soaps as well as for filter blocks and many other purposes.\r\n\r\nOther important abrasives are emery and corundum, garnet, pumice,\r\ndiamond dust and bort, and feldspar.\r\n\r\nImports of abrasive materials into the United States have about\r\none-third of the value of those locally produced. While all of the\r\nvarious abrasives are represented in these imports, the United States is\r\ndependent on foreign sources for important parts of its needs only of\r\nemery and corundum, garnet, pumice, diamond dust and bort, and grinding\r\npebbles.\r\n\r\nEmery and corundum are used in various forms for the grinding and\r\npolishing of hard materials--steel, glass, stone, etc. The principal\r\nforeign sources of emery have been Turkey (Smyrna) and Greece (Naxos)\r\nwhere reserves are large and production cheap. Production of corundum\r\nhas come from Canada, South Africa, Madagascar, and India. The domestic\r\nproduction of emery is mainly from New York and Virginia, and corundum\r\ncomes from North Carolina. Domestic supplies are insufficient to meet\r\nrequirements, and cannot be substituted for the foreign material for the\r\npolishing of fine glass and other special purposes. Curtailment of\r\nimports during the war greatly stimulated the development of artificial\r\nabrasives and their substitution for emery and corundum.\r\n\r\nGarnet is used chiefly in the form of garnet paper for working leather,\r\nwood, and brass. Garnet is produced mainly in the United States and\r\nSpain. The United States is the only country using large amounts of this\r\nmineral and imports most of the Spanish output. The domestic supply\r\ncomes mainly from New York, New Hampshire, and North Carolina.\r\n\r\nPumice is used in fine finishing and polishing of varnished and enameled\r\nsurfaces, and in cleaning powders. The world's principal source for\r\npumice is the Lipari Islands, Italy. There is a large domestic supply of\r\nsomewhat lower-grade material (volcanic ash) in the Great Plains region,\r\nand there are high-grade materials in California and Arizona. Under war\r\nconditions these supplies were drawn on, but normally the high-quality\r\nItalian pumice can be placed in American markets more cheaply.\r\n\r\nDiamond dust is used for cutting gem stones and other very hard\r\nmaterials, and borts or carbonadoes (black diamonds) for\r\ndiamond-drilling in exploration. Most of the black diamonds come from\r\nBrazil, and diamond dust comes from South Africa, Brazil, Borneo, and\r\nIndia.\r\n\r\nChert or flint pebbles for tube-mills are supplied mainly from the\r\nextensive deposits on the French and Danish coasts. The domestic\r\nproduction has been small, consisting principally of flint pebbles from\r\nthe California beaches, and artificial pebbles made from rhyolite in\r\nNevada and quartzite in Iowa. War experience demonstrated the\r\npossibility of using the domestic supply in larger proportion, but the\r\ngrade is such that in normal times this supply will not compete with\r\nimportations.\r\n\r\nFeldspar as an abrasive is used mainly in scouring soaps and\r\nwindow-wash. Domestic supplies are ample. The principal use of feldspar\r\nis in the ceramic industry and the mineral is discussed at greater\r\nlength in the chapter on common rocks (p. 86).\r\n\r\nFor the large number of abrasives produced from silica, outside of flint\r\npebbles, domestic sources of production are ample. Siliceous rocks are\r\navailable almost everywhere. For particular purposes, however, rocks\r\npossessing the exact combinations of qualities which make them most\r\nsuitable are in many cases distinctly localized. _Millstones and\r\nbuhrstones_, used for grinding cereals, paint ores, cement rock,\r\nfertilizers, etc., are produced chiefly in New York and Virginia; partly\r\nbecause of trade prejudice and tradition, about a third of the American\r\nrequirements are imported from France, Belgium, and Germany.\r\n_Grindstones and pulpstones_, used for sharpening tools, grinding\r\nwood-pulp, etc., come mainly from Ohio and to a lesser extent from\r\nMichigan and West Virginia; about 5 per cent of the consumption is\r\nimported from Canada and Great Britain. _Hones_, _oilstones_, and\r\n_whetstones_ are produced largely from a rock called \"novaculite\" in\r\nArkansas, and also in Indiana, Ohio, and New England; imports are\r\nnegligible. _Flint linings_ for tube-mills were formerly imported from\r\nBelgium, but American products, developed during the war in\r\nPennsylvania, Tennessee, and Iowa, appear to be wholly satisfactory\r\nsubstitutes. _Diatomaceous earth_ is produced in California, Nevada,\r\nConnecticut, and Maryland, and _tripoli and rottenstone_ in Illinois,\r\nMissouri, and Oklahoma; domestic sources are sufficient for all needs,\r\nbut due to questions of back-haul and cost of rail transportation there\r\nhas been some importation from England and Germany.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nThe geologic features of silica (quartz), feldspar, and diamonds are\r\nsufficiently indicated elsewhere (Chapter II; pp. 84, 196, 86, 291-292).\r\n\r\nDiatomaceous earth is made up of remains of minute aquatic plants. It\r\nmay be loose and powdery, or coherent like chalk. It is of sedimentary\r\norigin, accumulated originally at the bottoms of ponds, lakes, and in\r\nthe sea.\r\n\r\nTripoli and rottenstone are light, porous, siliceous rocks which have\r\nresulted from the leaching of calcareous materials from various\r\nsiliceous limestones or calcareous cherts in the process of weathering.\r\n\r\nGrinding pebbles are derived from the erosion of limestone or chalk\r\nformations which contain concretions of extremely fine-grained and dense\r\nchert. Under stream and wave action they are rounded and polished. The\r\nprincipal sources are ocean beaches.\r\n\r\nCorundum as an abrasive is the mineral of this name--made up of\r\nanhydrous aluminum oxide. Emery is an intimate mechanical mixture of\r\ncorundum, magnetite, and sometimes spinel. Corundum is a product of\r\ncontact metamorphism and also a result of direct crystallization from\r\nmolten magma. Canadian corundum occurs as a constituent of syenite and\r\nnepheline-syenite in Lower Ontario. In North Carolina and Georgia, the\r\ncorundum occurs in vein-like bodies at the contact of peridotite with\r\ngneisses and schists, and also in part in the peridotite itself. In New\r\nYork the emery deposits are segregations of aluminum and iron oxides in\r\nnorite (a basic igneous rock). The emery of Greece and Turkey occurs as\r\nlenses or pockets in crystalline limestones, and is the result of\r\ncontact metamorphism by intrusive granites.\r\n\r\nGarnets result mainly from contact metamorphism, and commonly occur\r\neither in schists and gneisses or in marble. The principal American\r\noccurrences are of this type. Being heavy and resistant to weathering,\r\nthey are also concentrated in placers. The Spanish garnets are reported\r\nto be obtained by washing the sands of certain streams.\r\n\r\nPumice is solidified rock froth formed by escape of gases from molten\r\nigneous rocks at the surface. It is often closely associated with\r\nvolcanic ash, which is also used for abrasive purposes.\r\n\r\nIn general, the geologic processes entering into the formation of\r\nabrasives cover almost the full range from primary igneous processes to\r\nsurface alterations and sedimentation.\r\n\r\n\r\nASBESTOS\r\n\r\n\r\nECONOMIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nThe principal uses of asbestos are in high-pressure packing in heat\r\nengines, in thermal and electrical insulation, in fire-proofing, and in\r\nbrake-band linings.\r\n\r\nThe largest producers of asbestos are Canada (Quebec) and, to a\r\nconsiderably less extent, Russia. United States interests have financial\r\ncontrol of about a fourth of the Canadian production, and practically\r\nthe entire export trade of Canada goes to the United States. Russia\r\nexports nearly all her product to Germany, Austria, United Kingdom,\r\nBelgium, and the Netherlands. Previous to the war the output was largely\r\ncontrolled by a German syndicate. There is a considerable recent\r\nproduction in South Africa, which is taken by England and the United\r\nStates, and small amounts are produced in Italy, Cyprus, and Australia.\r\n\r\nThe United States has been a large importer of asbestos, from Canada and\r\nsome other sources. Domestic production is relatively insignificant, and\r\nexports depend chiefly on an excess of import. Georgia is the principal\r\nlocal source. Arizona and California are also producers, their product\r\nbeing of a higher grade. The United States is the largest manufacturer\r\nof asbestos goods, and exports go to nearly all parts of the world.\r\n\r\nSo long as the abundant Canadian material is accessible on reasonable\r\nconditions, the United States is about as well situated as if\r\nindependent. Some Canadian proposals of restriction during the war led\r\nto a study of other supplies and showed that several deposits, such as\r\nthose in Russia and Africa, might compete with the Canadian asbestos.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nAsbestos consists mostly of magnesium silicate minerals--chrysotile,\r\nanthophyllite, and crocidolite. The term asbestos covers all fibrous\r\nminerals with some tensile strength which are poor conductors and can be\r\nused for heat-protection. Like talc, they are derived principally from\r\nthe alteration of olivine, pyroxene, and amphibole,--or more commonly\r\nfrom serpentine, which itself results from the alteration of these\r\nminerals. Chrysotile is the most common, and because of the length,\r\nfineness, and flexibility of its fibers, enabling it to be spun into\r\nasbestos ropes and fabrics, it is the most valuable. Anthophyllite\r\nfibers, on the other hand, are short, coarse, and brittle, and can be\r\nused only for lower-grade purposes. Crocidolite or blue asbestos is\r\nsimilar to chrysotile but somewhat inferior in fire-resisting qualities.\r\n\r\nAsbestos deposits occur chiefly as veinlets in serpentine rock, which is\r\nitself the alteration of some earlier rock like peridotite. They are\r\nclearly formed in cracks and fissures through the agency of water, but\r\nwhether the waters are hot or cold is not apparent. The veinlets have\r\nsometimes been interpreted as fillings of contraction cracks, but more\r\nprobably are due to recrystallization of the serpentine, proceeding\r\ninward from the cracks. In Quebec the chrysotile asbestos (which is\r\npartly of spinning and partly of non-spinning grade) forms irregular\r\nveins of this nature in serpentine, the fiber making up 2 to 6 per cent\r\nof the rock.\r\n\r\nIn Georgia the asbestos, which is anthophyllite, occurs in lenticular\r\nmasses in peridotite associated with gneiss. It is supposed to have\r\nformed by the alteration of olivine and pyroxene in the igneous rocks.\r\nIn Arizona chrysotile is found in veins in cherty limestone, associated\r\nwith diabase intrusives. Here it is believed to be an alteration product\r\nof diopside (lime-magnesia pyroxene) in a contact-metamorphic silicated\r\nzone.\r\n\r\nCrocidolite is mined on a commercial scale only in Cape Colony, South\r\nAfrica. The deposits occur in thin sedimentary layers interbedded with\r\njaspers and ironstones. Their origin has not been worked out in detail.\r\n\r\nThe deposits of Russia, the Transvaal, Rhodesia, and Australia are of\r\nhigh-grade chrysotile, probably similar in origin to the Quebec\r\ndeposits. The asbestos of Italy and Cyprus is anthophyllite, more like\r\nthe Georgia material.\r\n\r\n\r\nBARITE (BARYTES)\r\n\r\n\r\nECONOMIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nBarite is used chiefly as a material for paints. For this purpose it is\r\nemployed both in the ground form and in the manufacture of lithopone, a\r\nwidely used white paint consisting of barium sulphate and zinc sulphide.\r\nGround barite is also used in certain kinds of rubber goods and in the\r\nmaking of heavy glazed paper. Lesser amounts go into the manufacture of\r\nbarium chemicals, which are used in the preparation of hydrogen\r\nperoxide, in softening water, in tanning leather, and in a wide variety\r\nof other applications.\r\n\r\nGermany is the world's principal producer of barite and has large\r\nreserves of high grade. Great Britain also has extensive deposits and\r\nproduces perhaps one-fourth as much as Germany. France, Italy, Belgium,\r\nAustria-Hungary, and Spain produce smaller but significant amounts.\r\n\r\nBefore the war the United States imported from Germany nearly half the\r\nbarite consumed in this country, and produced the remainder. Under the\r\nnecessities of war times, adequate domestic supplies were developed and\r\ntook care of nearly all the greatly increased demands. Production has\r\ncome from fourteen states, the large producers being Georgia, Missouri,\r\nand Tennessee. During the war, also, an important movement of\r\nbarite-consuming industries to the middle west took place, in order to\r\nutilize more readily and cheaply the domestic product. For this reason\r\nit is not expected that German barite will play as important a part as\r\nformerly in American markets,--although it can undoubtedly be put down\r\non the Atlantic seaboard much more cheaply than domestic barite, which\r\nrequires long rail hauls from southern and middle-western states.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nThe mineral barite is a heavy white sulphate of barium, frequently\r\ncalled \"barytes\" or \"heavy spar.\" Witherite, the barium carbonate, is a\r\nmuch rarer mineral but is found with barite in some veins.\r\n\r\nAll igneous rocks contain at least a trace of barium, which is probably\r\npresent in the silicates, and these small quantities are the ultimate\r\nsource of the more concentrated deposits. Barite itself is not found as\r\nan original constituent of igneous rocks or pegmatites, but is\r\napparently always formed by deposition from aqueous solutions. It is a\r\ncommon gangue mineral in many deposits of metallic sulphides, both those\r\nformed in relation to igneous activity and those which are independent\r\nof such activity, but in these occurrences it is of little or no\r\ncommercial importance.\r\n\r\nThe principal deposits of barite are found in sedimentary rocks, and\r\nespecially in limestones and dolomites. In these rocks it occurs in\r\nveins and lenses very similar in nature to the lead and zinc deposits of\r\nthe Mississippi valley (p. 211 _et seq._), and, like them, probably\r\ndeposited by cold solutions which gathered together small quantities of\r\nmaterial from the overlying or surrounding rocks. The Missouri deposits\r\nare found in limestones in a region not far from the great southeastern\r\nMissouri lead district, and vary from the lead deposits in relative\r\nproportions rather than in kind of minerals; the veins consist chiefly\r\nof barite, with minor quantities of silica, iron sulphide, galena, and\r\nsphalerite. The deposits of the southern Appalachians occur as lenses in\r\nlimestones and schists.\r\n\r\nBarite is little affected by surface weathering, and tends to remain\r\nbehind while the more soluble minerals of the associated rock are\r\ndissolved out and carried away. A limited amount of solution and\r\nredeposition of the barite takes place, however, resulting in its\r\nsegregation into nodules in the residual clays. Most of the barite\r\nactually mined comes from these residual deposits, which owe their\r\npresent positions and values to katamorphic processes. The accompanying\r\nclay and iron oxide are removed by washing and mechanical concentration.\r\n\r\nCertain investigators of the deposits of the Mississippi valley are\r\nextremely reluctant to accept the idea that the ores are formed by\r\nsurface waters of ordinary temperatures, and are inclined to appeal to\r\nheated waters from a hypothetical underlying magmatic source. The fact\r\nthat barite is a characteristic mineral of many igneous veins, and the\r\nfact that in this same general region it is found in the\r\nKentucky-Illinois fluorspar deposits,--where a magmatic source is\r\ngenerally accepted,--together with doubts as to the theoretical efficacy\r\nof meteoric waters to transport the minerals found in the barite\r\ndeposits, have led certain writers to ascribe to these barite deposits a\r\nmagmatic origin. The magmatic theory has not been disproved; but on the\r\nwhole the balance of evidence seems strongly to indicate that the barite\r\ndeposits as well as the lead and zinc ores, which are essentially the\r\nsame in nature though differing in mineral proportions, have been\r\nconcentrated from the adjacent sediments by ordinary surface waters.\r\n\r\n\r\nBORAX\r\n\r\n\r\nECONOMIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nBorax-bearing minerals are used almost entirely in the manufacture of\r\nborax and boric acid. Fully a third of the borax consumed in the United\r\nStates is used in the manufacture of enamels or porcelain-like coatings\r\nfor such objects as bathtubs, kitchen sinks, and cooking utensils. Other\r\nuses of borax or of boric acid are as a flux in the melting and\r\npurification of the precious metals, in decomposing chromite, in making\r\nglass, as a preservative, as an antiseptic, and as a cleansing agent.\r\nRecent developments indicate that the metal, boron, may play an\r\nimportant part in the metallurgy of various metals. It has been used in\r\nmaking very pure copper castings for electrical purposes, in aluminum\r\nbronzes, and in hardening aluminum castings; and an alloy, ferroboron,\r\nhas been shown experimentally to act on steel somewhat like\r\nferrovanadium.\r\n\r\nThe bulk of the world's borax comes from the Western Hemisphere, the\r\nUnited States and Chile being the two principal producers. There are\r\nadditional large deposits in northern Argentina, southern Peru, and\r\nsouthern Bolivia, which have thus far been little drawn on because of\r\ntheir inaccessibility. English financial interests control most of these\r\nSouth American deposits.\r\n\r\nThe only large European producer of borax is Turkey. Italy and Germany\r\nproduce small amounts. There has also been small production of borax in\r\nThibet, brought out from the mountains on sheep-back.\r\n\r\nThe United States supplies of borax are sufficient for all domestic\r\nrequirements and probably for export. Small quantities of boric acid are\r\nimported, but no borax in recent years. The domestic production comes\r\nentirely from California, though in the past deposits in Nevada and\r\nOregon have also been worked.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nThe element boron is present in various complex boro-silicates, such as\r\ndatolite and tourmaline, the latter of which is used as a precious stone\r\n(pp. 290, 293). None of these are commercial sources of borax. The\r\nprincipal boron minerals are borax or \"tincal\" (hydrated sodium borate),\r\ncolemanite (hydrated calcium borate), ulexite (hydrated calcium-sodium\r\nborate), and boracite (magnesium chloro-borate). Commercially the term\r\nborax is sometimes applied to all these materials. These minerals appear\r\nin nature under rather widely differing modes of origin.\r\n\r\nThe borax production of Italy is obtained from the famous \"soffioni\" or\r\n\"fumaroles\" of Tuscany. These are volcanic exhalations, in which jets of\r\nsteam carrying boric acid and various borates, together with ammonium\r\ncompounds, emerge from vents in the ground. The boric acid material is\r\nrecovered by a process of condensation.\r\n\r\nBorates, principally in the form of borax, occur in hot springs and in\r\nlakes of volcanic regions. The Thibet deposits, and those formerly\r\nworked at Borax Lake, California, are of this type. Certain of the\r\nhot-spring waters of the California coast ranges and of Nevada carry\r\nconsiderable quantities of boron, together with ammoniacal salts, and in\r\nsome places they deposit borax along with sulphur and cinnabar. It seems\r\nprobable (see p. 40) that these waters may come from an igneous source\r\nnot far beneath.\r\n\r\nMost of the borax deposits of California, Nevada, and Oregon, though not\r\nat present the largely producing ones, and probably most of the Chilean\r\nand adjacent South American deposits, are formed by the evaporation of\r\ndesert lakes. They are products of desiccation, and in Chile are\r\nassociated with the great nitrate deposits (pp. 102-104), which are of\r\nsimilar origin. The salts contained in these deposits are mainly borax,\r\nulexite, and colemanite. The sources of these materials are perhaps\r\ndeposits of the type mentioned in the last paragraph, or, in California,\r\ncertain Tertiary borate deposits described below. Whatever their source,\r\nthe borates are carried in solution by the waters of occasional rains to\r\nshallow basins, which become covered with temporary thin sheets of water\r\nor \"playa lakes.\" Evaporation of these lakes leaves broad flats covered\r\nwith the white salts. These may subsequently be covered with drifting\r\nsands and capillary action may cause the borates to work up through the\r\nsands, becoming mixed with them and efflorescing at the surface. One of\r\nthe largest of the California deposits of this general class is that at\r\nSearles Lake, from which it has been proposed to recover borax along\r\nwith the potash (pp. 113-114).\r\n\r\nThe deposits which at present constitute the principal source of\r\ndomestic borax are not the playa deposits just described, but are masses\r\nof colemanite in Tertiary clays and limestones with interbedded basaltic\r\nflows. The principal deposits are in Death Valley and adjacent parts of\r\nCalifornia. The colemanite occurs in irregular milky-white layers or\r\nnodules, mingled with more or less gypsum. The deposits are believed to\r\nbe of the replacement type, rather than ones formed contemporaneously\r\nwith the sediments. Whether they are due to magmatic solutions carrying\r\nboric acid from the associated flows, or to surface waters carrying\r\nmaterials leached from other sediments, is not clear. The crude\r\ncolemanite as mined carries an average of about 25 per cent B_2O_3; it\r\nis treated with soda in the manufacture of borax, or with sulphuric acid\r\nin making boric acid.\r\n\r\nBoron is present in minute quantities in sea water. When such water\r\nevaporates, it becomes concentrated, along with the magnesium and\r\npotassium salts, in the \"mother liquor\"; and upon complete evaporation,\r\nit crystallizes out as boracite and other rarer minerals. Thus the\r\nStassfurt salts of Germany (p. 113) contain borates of this type in the\r\ncarnallite zone of the upper part of the deposits. This is the only\r\nimportant case known of borate deposits of marine origin.\r\n\r\n\r\nBROMINE\r\n\r\n\r\nECONOMIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nBromine finds a considerable use in chemistry as an oxidizing agent, in\r\nseparating gold from other metals, and in manufacturing disinfectants,\r\nbromine salts, and aniline colors. The best known and most widely used\r\nbromine salts are the silver bromide, used in photography, and the\r\npotassium bromide, used in medicine to depress the nervous system.\r\nDuring the war, large quantities of bromine were used in asphyxiating\r\nand lachrymating gases.\r\n\r\nThe chief center of the bromine industry in Europe prior to 1914 was\r\nStassfurt, Germany. No other important commercial source in foreign\r\ncountries is known, though small quantities have been obtained from the\r\nmother liquors of Chile saltpeter and from the seaweed, kelp, in various\r\ncountries. India has been mentioned as a possible large producer in the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nThe United States is independent of foreign sources for bromine. The\r\nentire domestic tonnage is produced from brines pumped in Michigan,\r\nOhio, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania. A large part of the output is not\r\nactually marketed as bromine, but in the form of potassium and sodium\r\nbromides and other salts. During the war considerable quantities of\r\nbromine materials were exported to Great Britain, France, and Italy.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nBromine is very similar chemically to chlorine, and is found under much\r\nthe same conditions, though usually in smaller quantities. The natural\r\nsilver bromide (bromyrite) and the combined silver chloride and bromide\r\n(embolite) are fairly common in the oxide zones of silver ores, but are\r\nnot commercial sources of bromine.\r\n\r\nBromine occurs in sea water in appreciable amounts, as well as in some\r\nspring waters and many natural brines. When natural salt waters\r\nevaporate, bromine is one of the last materials to be precipitated, and\r\nthe residual \"mother liquors\" or bitterns frequently show a considerable\r\nconcentration of the bromine. Where complete evaporation takes place, as\r\nin the case of the Stassfurt salt deposits (p. 113), the bromine salts\r\nare crystallized out in the final stages along with the salts of sodium,\r\nmagnesium, and potassium. The larger part of the world's bromine has\r\ncome from the mother liquor resulting from the solution and fractional\r\nevaporation of these Stassfurt salts.\r\n\r\nThe bromine obtained from salt deposits in the eastern United States is\r\ndoubtless of a similar origin. It is produced as a by-product of the\r\nsalt industry, the natural or artificial brines being pumped from the\r\nrocks (p. 295), and the bromides being extracted either from the mother\r\nliquors or directly from the unconcentrated brines.\r\n\r\n\r\nFULLER'S EARTH\r\n\r\n\r\nECONOMIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nFuller's earth is used chiefly for bleaching, clarifying, or filtering\r\nmineral and vegetable oils, fats, and greases. The petroleum industry is\r\nthe largest consumer. Minor uses are in the manufacture of pigments for\r\nprinting wall papers, in detecting coloring matters in certain\r\nfood-products, and as a substitute for talcum powder.\r\n\r\nFuller's earths are in general rather widely distributed. The principal\r\nproducers are the United States, England, and the other large consuming\r\ncountries of Europe. The only important international trade in this\r\ncommodity consists of exports from the United States to various\r\ncountries for treating mineral oils, and exports from England for\r\ntreating vegetable oils.\r\n\r\nThere is a large surplus production in the United States of fuller's\r\nearth of a grade suitable for refining mineral oils, but an inadequate\r\nproduction of material for use in refining edible oils, at least by\r\nmethods and equipment now in most general use. However, the imports\r\nneeded from England are more than offset by our exports to Europe of\r\ndomestic earth particularly adapted to the petroleum industry.\r\nProduction in the United States comes almost entirely from the southern\r\nstates; Florida produces over three-fourths of the total and other\r\nconsiderable producers are Texas, Georgia, California, and Arkansas.\r\nImports from England are normally equivalent to about a third of the\r\ndomestic production.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nFuller's earth is essentially a variety of clay having a high absorptive\r\npower which makes it useful for decolorizing and purifying purposes.\r\nFuller's earths are in general higher in water content and have less\r\nplasticity than most clays, but they vary widely in physical and\r\nchemical properties. Chemical analyses are of little value in\r\ndetermining whether a given clay will serve as fuller's earth, and an\r\nactual test is the only trustworthy criterion.\r\n\r\nDeposits of fuller's earth may occur under the same variety of\r\nconditions as deposits of other clays. The deposits of Florida and\r\nGeorgia consist of beds in slightly consolidated flat-lying Tertiary\r\nsediments, which are worked by open cuts. The Arkansas deposits are\r\nresidual clays derived from the weathering of basic igneous rocks, and\r\nare worked through shafts.\r\n\r\n\r\nGRAPHITE (PLUMBAGO)\r\n\r\n\r\nECONOMIC FEATURES\r\n\r\n_Crystalline graphite_ is used principally in the manufacture of\r\ncrucibles for the melting of brass, bronze, crucible steel, and\r\naluminum. About 45 per cent of the quantity and 70 per cent of the value\r\nof all the graphite consumed in the United States is employed in this\r\nmanner. Both _crystalline_ and _amorphous graphite_ are used in\r\nlubricants, pencils, foundry facings, boiler mixtures, stove-polishes\r\nand paint, electrodes, and fillers or adulterants for fertilizers. The\r\nmost important use of amorphous graphite is for foundry facings, this\r\napplication accounting for about 25 per cent of the total United States\r\nconsumption of graphite of all kinds. _Artificial graphite_ is not\r\nsuitable for crucibles or pencils but is adapted to meet other uses to\r\nwhich natural graphite is put. It is particularly adapted to the\r\nmanufacture of electrodes.\r\n\r\nThe grade of graphite deposits varies widely, their utilization being\r\nlargely dependent on the size of the grains and the ease of\r\nconcentration. Some of the richest deposits, those of Madagascar,\r\ncontain 20 per cent or more of graphite. The United States deposits\r\ncontain only 3 to 10 per cent. The graphite situation is complicated by\r\nthe differences in the quality of different supplies. Crucibles require\r\ncoarsely crystalline graphite, but pencils, lubricants, and foundry\r\nfacings may use amorphous and finely crystalline material.\r\n\r\nThe largest production of high-grade crucible graphite has come from\r\nCeylon, under British control, and about two-thirds of the output has\r\ncome to the United States. The mines are now worked down to water-level\r\nand costs are increasing.\r\n\r\nIn later years a rival supply has come from the French island of\r\nMadagascar, where conditions are more favorable to cheap production, and\r\nwhere reserves are very large. French, British, and Belgian interests\r\nare concerned in the development of these deposits. The quality of\r\ngraphite is different from the Ceylon product; it has not found favor in\r\nthe United States but is apparently satisfactory to crucible makers in\r\nEurope. Most of the output is exported to Great Britain and France, and\r\nsmaller amounts to Germany and Belgium.\r\n\r\nLess satisfactory supplies of crystalline graphite are available in many\r\ncountries, including Bavaria, Canada, and Japan. Large deposits of\r\ncrystalline material have been reported in Greenland, Brazil, and\r\nRoumania, but as yet have assumed no commercial importance.\r\n\r\nAmorphous graphite is widely distributed, being produced in about twenty\r\ncountries,--chiefly in Austria, Italy, Korea, and Mexico. Certain\r\ndeposits have been found to be best for special uses, but most countries\r\ncould get along with nearby supplies.\r\n\r\nA large part of the world's needs of crucible graphite will probably\r\ncontinue to be met from Ceylon and Madagascar, while a large part of\r\nthe amorphous graphite will come from the four sources mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe United States has been largely dependent upon importations from\r\nCeylon for crucible graphite. Domestic supplies are large and capable of\r\nfurther development, but for the most part the flake is of such quality\r\nthat it is not desired for crucible manufacture without large admixture\r\nof the Ceylon material. Restrictions during the war required crucible\r\nmakers to use at least 20 per cent of domestic or Canadian graphite in\r\ntheir mixtures, with 80 per cent of foreign graphite. This created a\r\ndemand for domestic graphite which caused an increased domestic output.\r\nMost of the production in the United States comes from the Appalachians,\r\nparticularly from Alabama, New York, and Pennsylvania, and smaller\r\namounts are obtained from California, Montana, and Texas. One of the\r\npermanently beneficial effects of the war was the improvement of\r\nconcentrating practice and the standardization of output, to enable the\r\ndomestic product to compete more effectively with the well-standardized\r\nimported grades. Whether the domestic production will hold its own with\r\nforeign competition under peace conditions remains to be seen. Domestic\r\nreserves are large but of low grade.\r\n\r\nThe Madagascar graphite, in the shape and size of the flakes, is more\r\nlike the American domestic graphite than the Ceylon product. Small\r\namounts have been used in this country, but American consumers appear in\r\ngeneral to prefer the Ceylon graphite in spite of its greater cost. The\r\nMadagascar product can be produced and supplied to eastern United States\r\nmarkets much more cheaply than any other large supply; and, in view of\r\nthe possible exhaustion of the Ceylon deposits, it may be desirable for\r\nAmerican users to adapt crucible manufacture to the use of Madagascar\r\nmaterial as has already apparently been done in Europe.\r\n\r\nExpansion of the American graphite industry during the war, and its\r\nsubsequent collapse, have resulted in agitation for a duty on imports of\r\nforeign graphite.\r\n\r\nAmorphous graphite is produced from some deposits in the United States\r\n(Colorado, Nevada, and Rhode Island), but the high quality of Mexican\r\ngraphite, which is controlled by a company in the United States, makes\r\nit likely that imports from this source will continue. Since the war the\r\nMexican material has practically replaced the Austrian graphite in\r\nAmerican markets. The output of Korea is divided between the United\r\nStates and England.\r\n\r\nArtificial graphite, in amounts about equal to the domestic production\r\nof amorphous graphite, is produced from anthracite or petroleum coke at\r\nNiagara Falls.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nThe mineral graphite is a soft, steel-gray, crystalline form of carbon.\r\n\r\nCeylon graphite occurs in veins and lenses cutting gneisses and\r\nlimestones. Usually the veins consist almost entirely of graphite, but\r\nsometimes other minerals occur in important amounts, especially pyrite\r\nand quartz. The association of graphite with these minerals, and also\r\nwith feldspar, pyroxene, apatite, and other minerals, suggests that the\r\nveins are of igneous origin, like some of the pegmatite veins in the\r\nAdirondacks of New York. The graphite is mined from open pits and\r\nshafts, and sorted by hand and mechanically. The product consists of\r\nangular lumps or chips with a relatively small amount of surface in\r\nproportion to their volume.\r\n\r\nIn Madagascar the graphite is mainly disseminated in a graphitic schist,\r\nthough to some extent it is present in the form of veins and in gneiss.\r\nMost of the graphite is mined from a weathered zone near the surface,\r\nand the material is therefore soft and easily concentrated. The product\r\nis made up of flakes or scales, and in the making of crucibles requires\r\nthe use of larger amounts of clay binder than the Ceylon graphite.\r\n\r\nThe flake graphite of the United States, principally in the Appalachian\r\nregion, occurs in crystalline graphitic schists, resulting from the\r\nanamorphism of sedimentary rocks containing organic matter. Certain beds\r\nor zones of comparatively narrow width carry from 3 to 10 per cent of\r\ndisseminated graphite. The graphite is recovered by mechanical processes\r\nof sorting. The graphite is believed to be of organic origin, the change\r\nfrom organic carbon to graphite having been effected by heat and\r\npressure accompanying mountain-building stresses. Some of the graphite\r\nalso occurs in pegmatite intrusives and adjacent wall rocks. This\r\ngraphite is considered to be of inorganic origin, formed by the breaking\r\nup of gaseous oxides of carbon in the original magma of the pegmatites.\r\nThe Montana graphite is similar in origin. This inorganic graphite in\r\npegmatite veins resembles Ceylon graphite, in breaking into large lumps\r\nand chips, but supplies are very limited.\r\n\r\nAmorphous graphite is formed in many places where coal and other\r\ncarbonaceous materials have undergone extreme metamorphism. It\r\nrepresents simply a continuation in the processes by which high grade\r\ncoals are formed from plant matter (pp. 123-127). The Mexican deposits\r\nare of this type, and occur in beds up to 24 feet in thickness\r\ninterbedded with metamorphosed sandstones.\r\n\r\nIn general, graphite is primarily concentrated both by igneous processes\r\nin dikes, and by sedimentary processes in beds. In the latter case\r\nanamorphism is necessary to recrystallize the carbon into the form of\r\ngraphite.\r\n\r\n\r\nGYPSUM\r\n\r\n\r\nECONOMIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nThe principal use of gypsum is in structural materials. About two-thirds\r\nof the gypsum produced in the United States is used in the manufacture\r\nof various plasters--wall plaster, plaster of Paris, and Keene's cement\r\n(for statuary and decorative purposes),--and about a fifth is used as a\r\nretarder in Portland cement. Another important structural use is in the\r\nmanufacture of plaster boards, blocks, and tile for interior\r\nconstruction. Gypsum is used as a fertilizer under the name of \"land\r\nplaster,\" and with the growing recognition of the lack of sulphur in\r\nvarious soils an extension of its application is not unlikely. Minor\r\nuses are in the polishing of plate glass, in the manufacture of dental\r\nplaster, in white pigments, in steampipe coverings, and as a filler in\r\ncotton goods.\r\n\r\nThe world's gypsum deposits are widely distributed. Of foreign\r\ncountries, France, Canada, and the United Kingdom are the principal\r\nproducers. Germany, Algeria, and India produce comparatively meager\r\namounts. The United States is the largest producer of gypsum in the\r\nworld. In spite of its large production, the United States normally\r\nimports quantities equivalent to between one-fifteenth and one-tenth of\r\nthe domestic production, mainly in the crude form from Nova Scotia and\r\nNew Brunswick for consumption by the mills in the vicinity of New York.\r\nThis material is of a better grade than the eastern domestic supply,\r\nand is cheaper than the western supply for eastern consumption. During\r\nthe war this importation was practically stopped because of governmental\r\nrequisition of the carrying barges for the coal-carrying trade, but with\r\nthe return of normal conditions it was resumed. There is no prospect of\r\nimportation of any considerable amount from any other sources. The\r\ndomestic supply is ample for all demands.\r\n\r\nProduction of gypsum in the United States comes from eighteen states.\r\nFour-fifths of the total comes from New York, Iowa, Michigan, Ohio,\r\nTexas, and Oklahoma. There are extensive deposits in some of the western\r\nstates, the known reserves in Wyoming alone being sufficient for the\r\nentire world demands for many decades.\r\n\r\nThe United States exports a small amount of crude gypsum to Canada,\r\nprincipally for use in Portland cement manufacture. This exportation is\r\ndue to geographic location. The United States is the largest\r\nmanufacturer of plaster boards, insulating materials, and tile, and\r\nexports large quantities of these products to Cuba, Australia, Japan,\r\nand South America.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nGypsum is a hydrated calcium sulphate. It is frequently associated with\r\nminor quantities of anhydrite, which is calcium sulphate without water,\r\nand under the proper natural conditions either of these materials may be\r\nchanged into the other.\r\n\r\nCommon impurities in gypsum deposits include clay and lime carbonate,\r\nand also magnesia, silica, and iron oxide. In the material as extracted,\r\nimpurities may range from a trace to about 25 per cent. _Gypsite_, or\r\ngypsum dirt, is an impure mixture of gypsum with clay or sand found in\r\nKansas and some of the western states; it is believed to have been\r\nproduced in the soil or in shallow lakes, by spring waters carrying\r\ncalcium sulphate which was leached from gypsum deposits or from other\r\nrocks.\r\n\r\nGypsum deposits, like deposits of common salt, occur in beds which are\r\nthe result of evaporation of salt water. Calcium makes up a small\r\npercentage of the dissolved material in the sea, and when sea waters are\r\nabout 37 per cent evaporated it begins to be precipitated as calcium\r\nsulphate. Conditions for precipitation are especially favorable in arid\r\nclimates, in arms of the sea or in enclosed basins which may or may not\r\nonce have been connected with the sea. Simultaneously with the\r\ndeposition of gypsum, there may be occasional inwashings of clay and\r\nsand, and with slight changes of conditions organic materials of a limey\r\nnature may be deposited. Further evaporation of the waters may result in\r\nthe deposition of common salt. Thus gypsum beds are found interbedded\r\nwith shales, sandstones, and limestones, and frequently, but not always,\r\nthey are associated with salt beds. The nature of these processes is\r\nfurther discussed under the heading of salt (pp. 295-298).\r\n\r\nThe anhydrite found in gypsum deposits is formed both by direct\r\nprecipitation from salt water and by subsequent alteration of the\r\ngypsum. The latter process involves a reduction of volume, and\r\nconsequently a shrinkage and settling of the sediments. The hydration of\r\nanhydrite to form gypsum, on the other hand, involves an increase of\r\nvolume and may result in the doming up and shattering of the overlying\r\nsediments.\r\n\r\nGypsum is fairly soluble in ground-water, and sink-holes and solution\r\ncavities are often developed in gypsum deposits. These may allow the\r\ninwash of surface dirt and also may interfere with the mining.\r\n\r\nAll the important commercial gypsum deposits are believed to have been\r\nformed by evaporation of salt water in the manner indicated. Small\r\nquantities of gypsum are formed also when pyrite and other sulphides\r\noxidize to sulphuric acid and this acid acts on limestone. Thus gypsum\r\nis found in the oxide zones of some ore bodies. These occurrences are of\r\nno commercial significance.\r\n\r\n\r\nMICA\r\n\r\n\r\nECONOMIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nThe principal use of sheet mica is for insulating purposes in the\r\nmanufacture of a large variety of electrical equipment. The highest\r\ngrades are employed particularly in making condensers for magnetos of\r\nautomobile and airplane engines and for radio equipment, and in the\r\nmanufacture of spark plugs for high tension gas engines. Sheet mica is\r\nalso used in considerable amounts for glazing, for heat insulation, and\r\nas phonograph diaphragms. Ground mica is used in pipe and boiler\r\ncoverings, as an insulator, in patent roofing, and for lubricating and\r\ndecorative purposes.\r\n\r\nIndia, Canada, and the United States are the important sheet\r\nmica-producing countries, before the war accounting for 98 per cent of\r\nthe world's total. India has long dominated the sheet mica markets of\r\nthe world, and will probably continue to supply the standard of quality\r\nfor many years. The bulk of the Indian mica is consumed in the United\r\nStates, Great Britain, and Germany. The mica of India and the United\r\nStates is chiefly muscovite. Canada is the chief source of amber mica\r\n(phlogopite), though other deposits of potential importance are known in\r\nCeylon and South Africa. Canadian mica is produced chiefly in Quebec and\r\nOntario, and is exported principally to the United States.\r\n\r\nImportant deposits of mica (principally muscovite) are also known in\r\nBrazil, Argentina, and German East Africa. Large shipments were made\r\nfrom the two former countries during the war, both to Europe and the\r\nUnited States, and Brazil particularly should become of increasing\r\nimportance as a producer of mica. The deposits in German East Africa\r\nwere being quite extensively developed immediately before the war and\r\nlarge shipments were made to Germany in 1913.\r\n\r\nThe United States is the largest consumer of sheet mica and mica\r\nsplittings, absorbing normally nearly one-half of the world's\r\nproduction. Approximately three-fifths of this consumption is in the\r\nform of mica splittings, most of which are made from muscovite in India\r\nand part from amber mica in Canada. Due to the cheapness of labor in\r\nIndia and the amenability of Indian mica to the splitting process, India\r\nsplittings should continue to dominate the market in this country. Amber\r\nmica is a variety peculiarly adapted to certain electrical uses. There\r\nare no known commercial deposits of this mica in the United States, but\r\nAmerican interests own the largest producing mines in Canada. Shipments\r\nof Brazilian mica are not of such uniformly high quality as the Indian\r\nmaterial, but promise to become of increasing importance in American\r\nmarkets.\r\n\r\nOf the sheet mica consumed annually, the United States normally produces\r\nabout one-third. War conditions, although stimulating the production of\r\ndomestic mica very considerably, did not materially change the\r\nsituation in this country as regards the dependence of the United States\r\non foreign supplies for sheet mica.\r\n\r\nAbout 70 per cent of the domestic mica comes from North Carolina and 25\r\nper cent from New Hampshire. The deposits are small and irregular, and\r\nmining operations are small and scattered. These conditions are largely\r\nresponsible for the heterogeneous nature of the American product. It is\r\nhardly possible for any one mine to standardize and classify its\r\nproduct, although progress was made in this direction during the war by\r\nthe organization of associations of mica producers. This lack of\r\nstandardization and classification is a serious handicap in competition\r\nwith the standard grades and sizes which are available in any desired\r\namounts from foreign sources.\r\n\r\nFor ground mica, the domestic production exceeds in tonnage the total\r\nworld production of sheet mica, and is adequate for all demands.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nMica is a common rock mineral, but is available for commerce only in\r\nigneous dikes of a pegmatite nature, where the crystallization is so\r\ncoarse that the mica crystals are exceptionally large. Muscovite mica\r\noccurs principally in the granitic pegmatite dikes. The phlogopite mica\r\nof Canada occurs in pyroxenite dikes. The distribution of mica within\r\nthe dikes is very erratic, making predictions as to reserves hazardous.\r\nThe associated minerals, mainly quartz and feldspar, are ordinarily\r\npresent in amounts greater than the mica. Also, individual deposits are\r\nlikely to be small. For these reasons mining operations cannot be\r\norganized on a large scale, but are ordinarily hand-to-mouth operations\r\nnear the surface. A large amount of hand labor is involved, and the\r\nIndian deposits are favored by the cheapness of native labor. The output\r\nof a district is from many small mines rather than from any single large\r\none.\r\n\r\nPegmatites which have been subjected to dynamic metamorphism are often\r\nnot available as a source of mica, because of the distortion of the mica\r\nsheets.\r\n\r\nThe mining of a mica is facilitated by weathering, which softens the\r\nassociated feldspar, making it an easier task to take out the mica\r\nblocks. On the other hand, iron staining by surface solutions during\r\nweathering may make the mica unfit for electrical and certain other\r\nuses.\r\n\r\nScrap or ground mica is obtained as a by-product of sheet mica and from\r\ndeposits where the crystals are not so well developed. Black mica\r\n(biotite) and chlorite minerals, which are soft and flexible but not\r\nelastic and are found extensively developed in certain schists, have\r\nbeen used to a limited extent for the same purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\nMONAZITE (THORIUM AND CERIUM ORES)\r\n\r\n\r\nECONOMIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nThe mineral monazite is the source of the thorium and cerium compounds\r\nwhich, glowing intensely when heated, form the light-giving material of\r\nincandescent gas mantles. Welsbach mantles consist of about 99 per cent\r\nthorium oxide and 1 per cent cerium oxide. Cerium metal, alloyed with\r\niron and other metals, forms the spark-producing alloys used in various\r\nforms of gas lighters and for lighting cigars, cigarettes, etc.\r\nMesothorium, a by-product of the manufacture of thorium nitrate for gas\r\nmantles, is used as a substitute for radium in luminous paints and for\r\ntherapeutic purposes. The alloy ferrocerium is used to a small extent in\r\niron and steel.\r\n\r\nThe world's supply of monazite is obtained mainly from Brazilian and\r\nIndian properties. Before the war German commercial interests controlled\r\nmost of the production, as well as the manufacture of the thorium\r\nproducts. During the war German control was broken up.\r\n\r\nThe United States has a supply of domestic monazite of lower grade than\r\nthe imports, but is dependent under normal conditions on supplies from\r\nBrazil and India. The American deposits are chiefly in North and South\r\nCarolina, and have been worked only during periods of abnormally high\r\nprices or of restriction of imports. Known reserves are small and the\r\ndeposits will probably never be important producers. During the war,\r\nhowever, the United States became the largest manufacturer of thorium\r\nnitrate and gas mantles and exported these products in considerable\r\nquantity. An effort is now being made to secure protective legislation\r\nagainst German thorium products.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nMonazite is a mineral consisting of phosphates of cerium, lanthanum,\r\nthorium, and other rare earths in varying proportions. The content of\r\nthorium oxide varies from a trace up to 30 per cent, and commercial\r\nmonazite sands are usually mixed so as to bring the grade up to at least\r\n5 per cent.\r\n\r\nYellowish-brown crystals of monazite have been found scattered through\r\ngranites, gneisses, and pegmatites, but in quantities ordinarily too\r\nsmall to warrant mining. In general the mineral is recovered on a\r\ncommercial scale only from placers, where it has been concentrated along\r\nwith other dense, insoluble minerals such as zircon, garnet, ilmenite,\r\nand sometimes gold. The Indian and Brazilian monazite is obtained\r\nprincipally from the sands of ocean beaches, in the same localities from\r\nwhich zircon is recovered (p. 189). The North and South Carolina\r\nmonazite has been obtained chiefly from stream beds, and to a slight\r\nextent by mining and washing the rotted underlying rock, which is a\r\npegmatized gneiss. Monazite, together with a small amount of gold, is\r\nalso known in the stream gravels of the Boise Basin, Idaho, where a\r\nlarge granitic batholith evidently carries the mineral sparsely\r\ndistributed throughout. These deposits have not been worked.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRECIOUS STONES\r\n\r\n\r\nECONOMIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nPrecious stones range high in the world's annual production of mineral\r\nvalues. A hundred or more minerals are used to some degree as precious\r\nstones; but those most prized, representing upwards of 90 per cent of\r\nthe total production value, are diamond, pearl, ruby, sapphire, and\r\nemerald. In total value the diamonds have an overwhelming dominance.\r\nOver a ton of diamonds is mined annually.\r\n\r\nDiamonds come mainly from South Africa, which produces over 99 per cent\r\nof the total. Pearls come chiefly from the Indian and Pacific oceans.\r\nBurma is the principal source of fine rubies. Siam is the principal\r\nproducer of sapphires. Colombia is the principal source of fine\r\nemeralds.\r\n\r\nThe United States produces small amounts of sapphires (in Montana) and\r\npearls (from fresh-water molluscs). Diamonds, rubies, and emeralds are\r\npractically absent on a commercial scale. Of other precious and\r\nsemi-precious gem stones produced in the United States, the principal\r\nones are quartz, tourmaline, and turquoise.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the United States absorbs by purchase over half of\r\nthe world's production of precious stones. It is estimated roughly that\r\nthere are now in the United States nearly one billion dollars' worth of\r\ndiamonds, or over one-half of the world's accumulated stock, and\r\nprobably the proportions for the other stones are not far different.\r\n\r\nValue attaches to a precious stone because of its qualities of beauty,\r\ncoupled with endurance and rarity, or because of some combination of\r\nthese features which has caught the popular fancy. No one of these\r\nqualities is sufficient to make a stone highly prized; neither does the\r\npossession of all of them insure value. Some beautiful and enduring\r\nstones are so rare that they are known only to collectors and have no\r\nstandard market value. Others fail to catch the popular fancy for\r\nreasons not obvious to the layman. While the intrinsic qualities go far\r\nin determining the desirability of a stone, it is clear that whim and\r\nchance have been no small factors in determining the demand or lack of\r\ndemand for some stones. As in other minerals, value has both its\r\nintrinsic and extrinsic elements.\r\n\r\nFor the leading precious stones above named, the values are more nearly\r\nstandard throughout the world than for any other minerals, with the\r\nexception of gold and possibly platinum. Highly prized everywhere and\r\neasily transported, the price levels show comparatively little variation\r\nover the world when allowance is made for exchange and taxes. The\r\nvaluation of precious stones is a highly specialized art, involving the\r\nappraisal not only of intrinsic qualities, but of the appeal which the\r\nstone will make to the buying public. In marking a sale price for some\r\nexceptional stone not commonly handled in the trade, experts in\r\ndifferent parts of the world often reach an almost uncanny uniformity of\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that the world stock of precious stones approximates\r\nthree billion dollars, or a third of the world's monetary gold reserve.\r\nBecause of small bulk and standard value, this wealth may be easily\r\nsecreted, carried, and exchanged. When the economic fabric of\r\ncivilization is disturbed by war or other conditions, precious stones\r\nbecome a medium of transfer and exchange of wealth of no inconsiderable\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nThe beauty of a stone may arise from its color or lack of color, from\r\nits translucency or opaqueness, from its high refraction of light, and\r\nfrom the manner of cutting and polishing to bring out these qualities.\r\nHardness and durability are desirable qualities. The diamond is the\r\nhardest known mineral and the sapphire, ruby, and emerald rank high in\r\nthis regard. On the other hand the pearl is soft and fragile and yet\r\nhighly prized.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nThe principal precious stones above named are of simple composition.\r\nDiamond is made of carbon; the pearl is calcium carbonate; ruby and\r\nsapphire are aluminum oxide--varieties of the mineral corundum; the\r\nemerald is silica and alumina, with a minor amount of beryllia. Minute\r\npercentages of chromite, iron, manganese, and other substances are often\r\nresponsible for the colors in these stones. Carbon also constitutes\r\ngraphite and is the principal element in coal. Lime carbonate is the\r\nprincipal constituent of limestone and marble. Alumina is the principal\r\nconstituent of bauxite, the ore of aluminum, and of the natural\r\nabrasives, emery and corundum. Silica, the substance of common quartz,\r\nalso constitutes gem quartz, amethyst, opal, agate, onyx, etc.\r\n\r\nMost of the world's diamonds come from the Kimberley and Transvaal\r\nfields of South Africa, where they are found in a much decomposed\r\nvolcanic rock called \"blue ground.\" This is a rock of dull, greasy\r\nappearance consisting largely of serpentine. It was originally\r\nperidotite, occurring in necks or plugs of old volcanoes penetrating\r\ncarbonaceous sediments. When the rock is mined and spread at the\r\nsurface, it decomposes in the course of six months or a year, allowing\r\nit to be washed and mechanically sorted for its diamond content. The\r\namount of ground treated in one of the large mines is about equal to\r\nthat handled in operating the huge porphyry copper deposit of Bingham,\r\nUtah; the annual production of diamonds from the same mine could be\r\ncarried in a large suit-case.\r\n\r\nThe diamonds were clearly formed at high temperatures and pressures\r\nwithin the igneous rocks. It has been suggested that the igneous magma\r\nmay have secured the carbon by the melting of carbonaceous sediments\r\nthrough which it penetrated, but proof of this is difficult to obtain.\r\nArtificial diamonds of small size have been made in the electric furnace\r\nunder high-pressure conditions not unlike those assumed to have been\r\npresent in nature.\r\n\r\nWeathering and transportation of rocks containing diamonds have resulted\r\nin the development of diamond-bearing placers. The South African\r\ndiamonds were first found in stream placers, leading to a search for\r\ntheir source and its ultimate discovery under a blanket of soil which\r\ncompletely covered the parent rock. The proportion of diamonds now mined\r\nfrom placers is very small.\r\n\r\nThe diamonds of Brazil come from placer deposits. This is the principal\r\nsource of the black diamond so largely used in diamond-drilling.\r\n\r\nThe United States produces no diamonds on a commercial scale. Small\r\ndiamonds have been found in peridotite masses in Pike County, Arkansas,\r\nbut these are of very little commercial value. A few diamonds have been\r\nfound in the glacial drift of Wisconsin and adjacent states, indicating\r\na possible diamond-bearing source somewhere to the north which has not\r\nyet been located (p. 317).\r\n\r\nPearls are concretions of lime carbonate of organic origin, and are\r\nfound in the shells of certain species of molluscs. Their color or\r\nluster is given by organic material or by the interior shell surface\r\nagainst which the pearl is formed. The principal supply comes from the\r\nIndian and Pacific Oceans, but some are found in the fresh water mussels\r\nof North America, in the Caribbean, and on the western coast of Mexico\r\nand Central America.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning of history the principal source of rubies has been\r\nupper Burma, where the stones are found in limestone or marble near the\r\ncontact with igneous rocks, associated with high-temperature minerals.\r\nThe weathering of the rock has developed placers from which most of the\r\nrubies are recovered. Siam is also an important producer. In the United\r\nStates rubies have been found in pegmatites in North Carolina, but these\r\ngems are of little commercial importance.\r\n\r\nSapphires are of the same composition as rubies and are found in much\r\nthe same localities. Most of the sapphires of the best quality come from\r\nSiam, where they are found in sandy clay of placer origin. In the United\r\nStates sapphires are recovered from alluvial deposits along the Missouri\r\nRiver near Helena, Montana, where they are supposed to have been derived\r\nfrom dikes of andesite rocks. In Fergus County, Montana, they are mined\r\nfrom decomposed dikes of lamprophyre (a basic igneous rock). In North\r\nCarolina sapphire has been found in pegmatite dikes.\r\n\r\nThe principal source of fine emeralds is in the Andes in Colombia. Their\r\noccurrence here is in calcite veins in a bituminous limestone, but\r\nlittle seems to be known of their origin. The only other emerald\r\nlocality of commercial importance is in the Ural Mountains of Siberia.\r\nEmeralds have been found in pegmatite dikes in North Carolina and New\r\nEngland, but the production is insignificant.\r\n\r\nTourmaline is a complex hydrous silicate of aluminum and boron, with\r\nvarying amounts of magnesium, iron, and alkalies. It is a rather common\r\nmineral in silicated zones in limestones near igneous contacts, but gem\r\ntourmalines are found principally in pegmatite dikes. They have a wide\r\nvariety of colors, the red and green gems being the most prized. Maine,\r\nCalifornia, and Connecticut are the principal American producers.\r\n\r\nTurquoise is a hydrated copper-aluminum phosphate. It is found in\r\nveinlets near the surface in altered granites and other igneous rocks.\r\nIt is usually associated with kaolin and frequently with quartz, and is\r\nbelieved to have been formed by surface alterations. In the United\r\nStates it is produced chiefly in Nevada, Arizona, and Colorado.\r\n\r\nIn general the principal gem minerals, except pearl and turquoise, occur\r\nas original constituents in igneous intrusives, usually of a pegmatite\r\nor peridotite nature. Sapphire, ruby, emerald, and tourmaline result\r\nalso from contact metamorphism of sediments in the vicinity of igneous\r\nrocks. Weathering softens the primary rocks, making it possible to\r\nseparate the gem stones from the matrix. When eroded and transported the\r\ngems are concentrated in placers.\r\n\r\n\r\nSALT\r\n\r\n\r\nECONOMIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nThe principal uses of salt are in the preserving and seasoning of foods\r\nand in chemical industries. Chemical industries require salt for the\r\nmanufacture of many sodium compounds, and also as a source of\r\nhydrochloric acid and chlorine. A minor use of salt is in the making of\r\nglazes and enamel on pottery and hardware.\r\n\r\nBecause of the wide distribution of salt in continental deposits and\r\nbecause of the availability of ocean and salt-lake brines as other\r\nsources, most countries of the world either possess domestic supplies of\r\nsalt adequate for the bulk of their needs, or are able to obtain\r\nsupplies from nearby foreign countries. Certain sea salts preferred by\r\nfish packers and other users are, however, shipped to distant points.\r\nAbout a fifth of all the salt consumed in the world annually is produced\r\nin the United States, and other large producers are Great Britain,\r\nGermany, Russia, China, India, and France.\r\n\r\nThe United States produces almost its entire consumption of salt, which\r\nis increasing at a very rapid rate. Salt is produced in fourteen states,\r\nbut over 85 per cent of the total output comes from Michigan, New York,\r\nOhio, and Kansas. Reserves are practically inexhaustible.\r\n\r\nExports and imports of salt form a very minor part of the United States\r\nindustry, each being equivalent to less than 5 per cent of the domestic\r\nproduction. A large part of the imported material is coarse\r\nsolar-evaporated sea salt, which is believed by fish and pork packers to\r\nbe almost essential to their industry. Imports of this salt come from\r\nSpain, Italy, Portugal, and the British and Dutch West Indies; during\r\nthe war, on account of ship shortage, they were confined chiefly to the\r\nWest Indies. A considerable tonnage of specially prepared kiln-dried\r\nsalt, desired by butter-makers, is imported from Liverpool, England.\r\nThere are also some small imports from Canada, probably because of\r\ngeographic location. Exports of domestic salt go chiefly to Canada,\r\nCuba, and New Zealand, with smaller amounts to practically all parts of\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nSalt is recovered from salt beds in two ways. About a fourth of the\r\nsalt produced in the United States is mined through shafts in the same\r\nmanner as coal, the lumps of salt being broken and sized just as coal is\r\nprepared for the market. The larger part of the United States\r\nproduction, however, is derived by pumping water down to the beds to\r\ndissolve the salt, and pumping the resulting brine to the surface where\r\nit is then evaporated. A considerable amount of salt, also, is recovered\r\nfrom natural brines--which represent the solution of rock salt by\r\nground-waters--and from the waters of salt lakes and the ocean.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nCommon salt constitutes the mineral halite, the composition of which is\r\nsodium chloride. It is rarely found perfectly pure in nature, but is\r\ncommonly mixed with other saline materials, such as gypsum and\r\nanhydrite, and occasionally with salts of potassium and magnesium. The\r\ngeneral grade of rock-salt deposits, where not admixed with clay, is\r\nperhaps 96 to 99 per cent of sodium chloride.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate source of salt deposits is the sodium and chlorine of\r\nigneous rocks. In the weathering of these rocks the soda, being one of\r\nthe more soluble materials, is leached out and carried off by\r\nground-waters, and in the end a large part of it reaches the sea. The\r\nchlorine follows a similar course; however, the amount of chlorine in\r\nordinary igneous rocks is so extremely small that, in order to explain\r\nthe amount of chlorine present in the sea, it has been thought necessary\r\nto appeal to volcanic emanations or to some similar agency. Ocean water\r\ncontains about 3.5 per cent by weight of dissolved matter, over\r\nthree-fourths of which consists of the constituents of common salt.\r\nChief among the other dissolved materials are magnesium, calcium,\r\npotassium, and SO_4 (the sulphuric acid radical).\r\n\r\nWhen sea water evaporates it becomes saturated with various salts,\r\naccording to the amounts of these salts present and their relative\r\nsolubilities. In a general way, after 37 per cent of the water has\r\nevaporated gypsum begins to separate out, and after 93 per cent has\r\nevaporated common salt begins to be deposited. After a large part of the\r\ncommon salt has been precipitated, the residual liquid, called a\r\n\"bittern\" or \"mother liquid,\" contains chiefly a concentration of the\r\nsalts of magnesium and potassium. Still further evaporation will result\r\nin their deposition, mainly as complex salts like those found in the\r\nStassfurt deposit (p. 113).\r\n\r\nThe actual processes of concentration and precipitation in sea water or\r\nother salt waters are much more complex than is indicated by the above\r\nsimple outline. The solubility of each of the various salts present, and\r\nconsequently the rate at which each will crystallize out as evaporation\r\nproceeds, depends upon the kinds and concentrations of all the other\r\nsalts in the solution. Temperature, pressure, mass-action, and the\r\ncrystallization of double salts are all factors which influence the\r\nnature and rate of the processes and add to their complexity. During a\r\nlarge part of the general process, several different salts may be\r\ncrystallizing out simultaneously. It is evident that gypsum may be\r\nprecipitated in some quantity, and that external conditions may then\r\nchange, so that evaporation ceases or so that the waters are freshened,\r\nbefore any common salt is crystallized out. This fact may explain in\r\npart why gypsum beds are more widely distributed than beds of common\r\nsalt. At the same time the much greater amount of sodium chloride than\r\nof calcium sulphate in sea water may explain the greater thickness of\r\nmany individual salt beds.\r\n\r\nThe evaporation of salt waters, either from the ocean or from other\r\nbodies of water, is believed to have been responsible for nearly all of\r\nthe important deposits of common salt. This process has been going on\r\nfrom Cambrian time down through all the intervening geologic ages, and\r\ncan be observed to be actually operative today in various localities.\r\nThe beds of salt so formed are found interstratified with shales,\r\nsandstones, and limestones, and are frequently associated with gypsum.\r\nOn a broad scale, they are always lens-shaped, though they vary greatly\r\nin extent and thickness.\r\n\r\nThe necessary conditions for the formation of extensive salt beds\r\ninclude arid climate and bodies of water which are essentially\r\nenclosed--either as lakes, as lagoons, or as arms of the sea with\r\nrestricted outlets,--where evaporation exceeds the contributions of\r\nfresh water from rivers, and where circulation from the sea is\r\ninsufficient to dilute the water and keep it at the same composition as\r\nthe sea water. Under such conditions the dissolved salts in the enclosed\r\nbody become concentrated, and precipitation may occur. A change of\r\nconditions so that mud or sand is washed in or so that calcareous\r\nmaterials are deposited, followed by a recurrence of salt-precipitation,\r\nresults in the interstratification of salt beds with shales, sandstones,\r\nand limestones.\r\n\r\nFor the formation of very thick beds of salt, and especially of thick\r\nbeds of fairly pure composition, however, this simple explanation of\r\nconditions is insufficient. The deposits of Michigan and New York occur\r\nin beds as much as 21 feet in thickness, with a considerable number of\r\nseparate beds in a section a few hundred feet thick. Beneath the potash\r\nsalt deposits of Stassfurt, beds of common salt 300 to 500 feet in\r\nthickness are found, and beds even thicker are known in other\r\nlocalities. When we come to investigate the volume of salts deposited\r\nfrom a given volume of sea water, we find it to be so small that for the\r\nformation of 500 feet of salt over a given area, an equivalent area of\r\nwater 25,000 feet deep would be required. It has therefore been one of\r\nthe puzzling problems of geology to determine the exact physical\r\nconditions under which deposition of these beds took place.\r\n\r\nOne of the most prominent theories, the \"bar\" theory, suggests that\r\ndeposition may have taken place in a bay separated from the sea by a\r\nbar. Sea water is supposed to have been able to flow in over the bar or\r\nthrough a narrow channel, so that evaporation in the bay was about\r\nbalanced by inflow of sea water. Thus the salts of a very large quantity\r\nof sea water may have accumulated in a small bay. As the process went\r\non, the salts would become progressively more concentrated, and would be\r\nprecipitated in great thickness. A final complete separation of the\r\nbasin from the sea, for instance by the relative elevation of the land,\r\nmight result in complete desiccation, and deposition of\r\npotassium-magnesium salts such as those found at Stassfurt (p. 113).\r\n\r\nAnother suggestion to explain the thickness of some salt beds is that\r\nthe salts in a very large basin of water may, as the water evaporated\r\nand the basin shrank, have been deposited in great thickness in a few\r\nsmall depressions of the basin.\r\n\r\nOther writers believe that certain thick salt deposits were formed in\r\ndesert basins (with no necessary connection with the sea), through the\r\nextensive leaching of small quantities of salt from previous sediments,\r\nand its transportation by water to desert lakes, where it was\r\nprecipitated as the lakes evaporated. Over a long period of time large\r\namounts of salt could accumulate in the lakes, and thick deposits could\r\nresult. Such hypotheses also explain those cases where common salt beds\r\nare unaccompanied by gypsum, since land streams can easily be conceived\r\nto have been carrying sodium chloride without appreciable calcium\r\nsulphate; in ocean waters, on the other hand, so far as known both\r\ncalcium sulphate and sodium chloride are always present, and gypsum\r\nwould be expected to accompany the common salt.\r\n\r\nA partial explanation of some great thicknesses found in salt beds is\r\nthat these beds, especially when soaked with water, are highly plastic\r\nand incompetent under pressure. In the deformation of the enclosing\r\nrocks, the salt beds will flow somewhat like viscous liquids, and will\r\nbecome thinned on the limbs of the folds and correspondingly thickened\r\non the crests and troughs.\r\n\r\nThe salt deposits of the Gulf Coast of Texas and Louisiana should be\r\nreferred to because of their exceptional features. They occur in low\r\ndomes in Tertiary and more recent sands, limestones, and clays. Vertical\r\nthicknesses of a few thousand feet of salt have been found, but the\r\nstructure is known only from drilling. In some of these domes are also\r\nfound petroleum, gypsum, and sulphur (p. 110). No igneous rocks are\r\nknown in the vicinity. It has been thought by some that the deposits\r\nwere formed by hot waters ascending along fissures from underlying\r\nigneous rocks, and the upbowing of the rocks has been variously\r\nexplained as due to the expanding force of growing crystals, to\r\nhydrostatic pressure of the solutions, and to laccolithic intrusions. On\r\nthe other hand, the uniform association of other salt and gypsum\r\ndeposits with sedimentary rocks, and the absence of igneous rocks,\r\nsuggest that these deposits may have had essentially a sedimentary\r\norigin, and that they have been modified by subsequent deformation and\r\nalteration. The origin is still uncertain.\r\n\r\nOther mineral deposits formed under much the same conditions as salt are\r\ngypsum, potash, borax, nitrates, and minerals of bromine; and in a study\r\nof the origin of salt deposits these minerals should also be\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\n\r\nTALC AND SOAPSTONE\r\n\r\n\r\nECONOMIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nSoapstone is a rock composed mainly of the mineral talc. Popularly the\r\nterms _talc_ and _soapstone_ are often used synonymously. The softness,\r\ngreasy feel, ease of shaping, and resistance to heat and acids of this\r\nmaterial make it useful for many purposes. Soapstone is cut into slabs\r\nfor laundry tubs, laboratory table tops, and other structural purposes.\r\nFiner grades are cut into slate pencils and acetylene burners. Ground\r\ntalc or soapstone is used as a filler for paper, paint, and rubber\r\ngoods, and in electrical insulation. Fine grades are used for toilet\r\npowder.\r\n\r\nPyrophyllite (hydrated aluminum silicate) resembles talc in some of its\r\nproperties and is used in much the same way. Fine English clays (p. 85)\r\nare sometimes used interchangeably with talc as paper filler.\r\n\r\nThe United States produces nearly two-thirds of the world's talc. The\r\nother large producers are France, Italy, Austria, and Canada (Ontario).\r\n\r\nThe United States is independent of foreign markets for the bulk of its\r\ntalc consumption, but some carefully prepared talc of high quality is\r\nimported from Canada, Italy, and France. Italy is our chief source of\r\ntalc for pharmaceutical purposes, though recently these needs have been\r\nlargely supplied by high-grade talc from California. In the United\r\nStates, Vermont and New York are the leading producers of talc and\r\nVirginia of soapstone slabs. Reserves are large.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGIC FEATURES\r\n\r\nTalc is hydrated magnesium silicate, as is also serpentine, a mineral\r\nwith which talc is closely associated. Both are common alteration\r\nproducts of magnesian silicate minerals such as olivine, pyroxene, and\r\namphibole. Talc is also derived from the recrystallization of magnesian\r\ncarbonates.\r\n\r\nTalc deposits consist of lenses and bands in metamorphic limestones,\r\nschists, and gneisses of ancient age. The talc itself is usually\r\nschistose like the wall rocks, and is largely a product of mechanical\r\nmashing. In some cases, also, talc results from the alteration of\r\nigneous rocks without mashing--as in the case of the large talc and\r\nsoapstone deposits of Virginia, which are the result of rather complete\r\nalteration of basic igneous rocks such as peridotites and pyroxenites.\r\n\r\nTalc is known to result from the weathering of magnesian silicates under\r\nsurface conditions, but the common occurrence of the principal deposits,\r\nin highly crystalline rocks which have undergone extensive deep-seated\r\nmetamorphism, is an indication that processes other than weathering have\r\nbeen effective. It has been suggested that hot ascending solutions have\r\nbeen responsible for the work, but without much proof. A more plausible\r\nexplanation for many deposits is that the talc results from the dynamic\r\nmetamorphism or shearing of impure magnesian carbonates (as in highly\r\nmagnesian limestones), the process resulting in elimination of the\r\ncarbon dioxide and recrystallization of the residue. Certain talc\r\ndeposits, such as those of Ontario, show clearly traces of the original\r\nbedding planes of limestone crossing the cleavage of the talc, and the\r\nrock bears all the evidence of having formed in the same manner as a\r\ncommon slate. Talc and slate are almost the only mineral products which\r\nowe their value principally to dynamic metamorphism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nEXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GENERAL RELATIONS OF THE GEOLOGIST TO EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT\r\n\r\nThe economic geologist is more vitally concerned with exploration and\r\ndevelopment than with any other phase of his work. This comes closest to\r\nbeing his special field. Here is a fascinating element of adventure and\r\nchance. Here is the opportunity to converge all his knowledge of geology\r\nand economics to a practical end. The outcome is likely to be definite\r\none way or the other, thus giving a quantitative measure of the accuracy\r\nof scientific thinking which puts a keen edge on his efforts. It is not\r\nenough merely to present plausible generalizations; scientific\r\nconclusions are followed swiftly either by proof or disproof. With this\r\ncheck always in mind, the scientist feels the necessity for the most\r\nrigid verification of his data, methods, and principles.\r\n\r\nThe general success of the application of geology to exploration and\r\ndevelopment is indicated by the rapid increase in demand for such\r\nservice in recent years, and by the large part it plays in nearly all\r\nsystematic and large-scale operations. The argument is sometimes made\r\nthat many mineral deposits have been found without geologic assistance,\r\nand that therefore the geologist is superfluous. The answer to this\r\nargument is that there are often hundreds of \"practical\" explorers in\r\nthe field to one geologist, and that in proportion to numbers the story\r\nis quite a different one. The very fact that many large mining\r\norganizations, as a result of their experience, now leave these matters\r\nof exploration and development largely in the hands of geologists, is a\r\ntribute to the usefulness of the science. Also, it is to be remembered\r\nthat not all applications of geology are made by geologists. It is hard\r\nto find a prospector or explorer who has not absorbed empirically some\r\nof the elements of geology, and locally this may be enough. Very often\r\nmen who take pride in the title of \"practical prospectors\" are the ones\r\nwith the largest stock of self-made geological theories.\r\n\r\nDuring a prospecting boom it is not uncommon for speculators and\r\npromoters to attempt to discount geologic considerations where these run\r\ncounter to their plans. The catching phrase \"bet against the geologist\"\r\nhas a broad appeal to an instinctive preference for the practical as\r\nopposed to the theoretical. If the public would stop to note the\r\ncharacter of the support behind the geologist, including as it does the\r\nlarger and more successful operators, it would not be so ready to accept\r\nthis implication.\r\n\r\nAnother aspect of this question might be mentioned. There is scarcely an\r\noil field or mining camp in the world without a cherished tradition to\r\nthe effect that, prior to discovery, the mineral possibilities had been\r\nreported on unfavorably by the geologists,--again implying that success\r\nhas been due to the hard common sense of the horny-handed prospector.\r\nThese traditions persist in the face of favorable geological reports\r\npublished before discovery; they are natural expressions of the\r\ninstinctive distrust of any knowledge which is beyond the field of\r\nempirical experience. In many cases the discoveries were made long\r\nbefore geologists appeared on the scene. In others, possibly one or two\r\ngeologic reports were unfavorable, while many were favorable. In the\r\naggregate, there can be no question that, in proportion to the scale of\r\nits use, geological advice has had more than its proportion of success.\r\n\r\nEven under the most favorable conditions, the chances against the\r\nsuccess of an individual drill hole or underground development are\r\nlikely to be greater than the chances for it. The geologist may not\r\nchange this major balance; but if he can reduce the adverse chances by\r\nonly a few per cent, his employment is justified on purely commercial\r\ngrounds.\r\n\r\nThe above comments refer to sound geological work by competent\r\nscientists. The geologic profession, like many others, is handicapped by\r\nnumbers of ill-trained men and by many who have assumed the title of\r\ngeologist without any real claim whatever,--who may do much to discredit\r\nthe profession. The very newness of the field makes it difficult to draw\r\na sharp line between qualified and unqualified men. With the further\r\ndevelopment of the profession this condition is likely to be improved\r\n(see pp. 427-428).\r\n\r\nSo new is the large-scale application of geology to exploration and\r\ndevelopment, and so diverse are the scientific methods of approach, that\r\nit is difficult to lay out a specific course for a student which will\r\nprepare him for all the opportunities he may have later. In the writer's\r\nexperience, both in teaching and practice, the only safe course for the\r\nstudent is to prepare broadly on purely scientific lines. With this\r\nbackground he will be able later to adapt himself to most of the special\r\nconditions met in field practice.\r\n\r\n\r\nPARTLY EXPLORED VERSUS VIRGIN TERRITORIES\r\n\r\nIn selecting an area to work, the geologic explorer will naturally\r\nconsider various factors mentioned in succeeding paragraphs; but the\r\nnatural first impulse is to start for some place where no one else has\r\nbeen, and to keep away from the older principal mining camps,--on the\r\nassumption that such grounds have been thoroughly explored and that\r\ntheir geological conditions bearing on exploration are fully understood.\r\nIt is safe to say that very few mineral districts are thoroughly\r\nunderstood and explored. Numerous important discoveries of recent years\r\nhave been in the extensions of old mines and old districts; and when one\r\nconsiders the scale of even the most extensive mine openings in\r\ncomparison with the vast body of rock available for exploration, it is\r\nclear that this will continue to be the situation far into the future.\r\nIt is the writer's belief that the economic geologist stands at least as\r\ngood a chance of success in exploration in the older districts as he\r\ndoes in new fields. Nature is exceedingly erratic and economical in\r\nproviding places favorable for mineral production; in a producing\r\ndistrict the geologic conditions have been proved to be right, and the\r\nexplorer starts here with this general pragmatic advantage. The explorer\r\nhere has another great advantage, that much essential information has\r\nbeen gathered which can be built into his plan of operations. He can\r\nstart, scientifically and practically, where the other man left off. One\r\nof the best-known economic geologists has maintained that the more\r\nprevious work done, the better, because it furnished him more tools to\r\nwork with. There is no such thing as \"skimming the cream\" from a\r\ngeologic problem; there is no end in sight in the search for more\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\nThis attitude toward the problem of exploration has also proved\r\nadvantageous on the business or financial side. A successful backer of\r\nmineral enterprises once remarked that his best prospecting was done\r\nfrom the rear platform of a private car,--meaning that this mode of\r\ntransportation had carried him to the center of important mining\r\nactivities, where the chances for large financial success showed a\r\nbetter percentage than in more general and miscellaneous exploration.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE USE OF ALL AVAILABLE INFORMATION\r\n\r\nEffective scientific exploration requires the use of all available\r\ninformation applying to the specific area. This might seem to be too\r\nobvious to require mention, yet observance of the methods of explorers\r\nseems to call for warning against the rather common tendency to go into\r\na field unprepared with a thorough knowledge of preceding work. It is\r\neasy to forget or overlook some investigation made many years\r\npreviously; or to assume that such work is out of date, and of no\r\nspecial consequence in the application of new thought and method which\r\nis the basis of the faith and confidence of each new geologic explorer.\r\nA study of the reports on an old camp shows how often the younger\r\ngenerations have ignored the results of the older. Many of the same\r\nelementary truths are rediscovered by successive generations, after\r\nlarge efforts which could have been saved by means of proper care and\r\ninvestigation of the previous literature and mapping.\r\n\r\nIn outlying parts of the world, the existing information bearing on\r\nexploration may be at a minimum. In many of the older mining camps and\r\nthroughout most civilized countries, however, careful investigation will\r\nusually disclose a considerable range of useful information bearing on\r\nthe territory to be explored. In the United States the natural course to\r\nbe pursued is to hunt carefully through the reports of the U. S.\r\nGeological Survey, the Bureau of Mines, various state surveys,\r\nuniversities, and private organizations (so far as these reports are\r\navailable), and through the technical journals and the reports of\r\ntechnical societies, for something bearing on the district to be\r\nexplored. Even if no specific report or map is to be found, it is\r\nusually possible to locate general maps or accounts which are likely to\r\nbe of use.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOOPERATION IN EXPLORATION\r\n\r\nCompetition in exploration often develops an atmosphere of suspicion and\r\nfurtiveness which is highly unfavorable to cooperative efforts.\r\nIndividuals and companies may handicap themselves greatly by a desire to\r\nplay a lone hand, and by failure to take advantage of an exchange of\r\ninformation. This action may be based, particularly on the part of\r\nstrong mining companies, on the assumption that they know all that is\r\nnecessary about the problem, and that an outsider has nothing to\r\ncontribute. Financial and other conditions may require this attitude;\r\nbut in large part it is a result of temperament, as clearly indicated by\r\nthe difference in methods followed by different groups and in different\r\nmining districts. From the scientific point of view this attitude can\r\nhardly be justified, in view of the extremely narrow limits of human\r\nknowledge as compared with the scientific field to be explored. The sum\r\ntotal of knowledge from all sources is only a small fraction of that\r\nnecessary for the most effective results. The mutual exchange of\r\ninformation and discussion is usually justified on the basis of\r\nself-interest alone, to say nothing of the larger interest to the\r\nmineral district, to the country, or to science.\r\n\r\nNational and state survey organizations exercise considerable effort to\r\nsecure records of drilling. In some cases they have the legal power to\r\ncommand this information, particularly in relation to appraisals for\r\ntaxation and \"blue sky\" laws. In a larger number of cases drill records\r\nare secured through voluntary cooperation with explorers. A considerable\r\nnumber of records are nevertheless not filed with public agencies and\r\nsome of these are permanently lost. Even where the records are turned in\r\nto a public organization, they are in most cases not directly available\r\nto explorers.\r\n\r\nPublic registration of all drilling records is a highly desirable\r\nprocedure in the interests of the development of the mineral industry as\r\na whole. A vast amount of unnecessary duplication can thus be avoided.\r\nThe record of a drill hole, even though barren, may be of vast\r\nsignificance in the interpretation of future developments and should be\r\nrecorded as carefully as an abstract of land title. The property right\r\nof the explorer in such information can be and usually is protected by\r\nwithholding the record from public inspection until sufficient time has\r\nelapsed to give him full opportunity to use the information to his own\r\nbest advantage.\r\n\r\nThe opportunities for cooperation with specialists of public\r\norganizations are almost unlimited. These organizations are likely to\r\nhave an accumulation of data and experience extending through long\r\nperiods and over large areas, which the private explorer ordinarily\r\ncannot hope to duplicate. With proper restrictions this information may\r\nbe available for public use. A good illustration of current cooperative\r\neffort of this kind is in the deep exploration for oil in the Trenton\r\nlimestone of Illinois. Outcrops and other specific indications are not\r\nsufficient to localize this drilling; but the information along broad\r\ngeologic and structural lines which has been collected previously by the\r\nIllinois Survey is sufficient so that, with a comparatively small amount\r\nof shallow drilling, the locus of the more favorable structural\r\nconditions may be determined. In this case the Survey is directing the\r\ninitial exploration, which is financed by private capital.\r\n\r\n\r\nECONOMIC FACTORS IN EXPLORATION\r\n\r\nThe approach to the problem of exploration is very often determined by\r\nlocal requirements and conditions; but if one were to come at the\r\nproblem from a distance and to keep matters in broad perspective, the\r\nfirst step would be a consideration of what might be called the\r\n_economic factors_. Let us suppose that the geologist is free to choose\r\nhis field of exploration. An obvious preliminary step is to eliminate\r\nfrom consideration mineral commodities which are not in steady or large\r\ndemand and are much at the mercy of market conditions, or which are\r\notherwise not well situated commercially. The underlying factors are\r\nmany and complex. They include the present nature and future\r\npossibilities of foreign competition, the domestic competition, the\r\ngrades necessary to meet competition, the cost of transportation, the\r\ncost of mining under local conditions--including considerations of labor\r\nand climatic and topographic conditions,--the probability of increase or\r\ndecrease in demand for the product, the possible changes in\r\nmetallurgical or concentrating practice (such as those which made\r\npossible the mining of low-grade porphyry copper ores), the size of\r\nalready available reserves, and the mining laws in relation to\r\nownership and regulation. Most of these factors are discussed at some\r\nlength on other pages. After looking into the economic conditions\r\nlimiting the chromite, nickel, or tin developments in the United States,\r\nthe explorer might hesitate to proceed in these directions,--for he\r\nwould find that past experience shows little promise of quantities and\r\ngrades equivalent to those available in other countries, and that there\r\nis little likelihood of tariffs or other artificial measures to improve\r\nthe domestic situation. Before and during the war, commercial conditions\r\nmight have shown the desirability of hunting for pyrite, but more recent\r\ndevelopments in the situation cast some doubt on this procedure. To go\r\nahead blindly in such a case, on the assumption that the pyrite market\r\nwould in some fashion readjust itself, would not be reasoned\r\nexploration. Again, in considering exploration for copper, account\r\nshould be taken in this country of the already large reserves developed\r\nfar in advance of probable demand, which require that any new\r\ndiscoveries be very favorably situated for competition. In oil, on the\r\nother hand, a very brief survey of the economic factors of the situation\r\nindicates the desirability of exploration. The comparative shortage of\r\nlead supplies at the present time suggests another favorable field for\r\nexploration.\r\n\r\nIn short, before actual field exploration is begun, intelligent\r\nconsideration of the economic factors may go far toward narrowing the\r\nfield and toward converging efforts along profitable lines. Looked at\r\nbroadly, this result is usually accomplished by the natural working of\r\ngeneral laws of supply and demand; but there are many individual cases\r\nof misdirected effort, under the spell of provincial conditions, which\r\nmight easily be avoided by a broader approach to the problem.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGIC FACTORS IN EXPLORATION\r\n\r\nComing to the geological aspects of exploration, the procedure in its\r\nearly stages is again one of elimination. Oil and coal, for instance,\r\nare found in certain sediments of certain ages, and one would not look\r\nfor them in an area of granite. For every mineral resource there are\r\nbroad geologic conditions of this sort, particularly the genetic,\r\nstructural, and metamorphic conditions, which make it possible to\r\neliminate vast areas from consideration and to concentrate on relatively\r\nsmall areas.\r\n\r\nAfter the elimination of unfavorable areas, there comes the hunt for\r\npositively favorable geologic conditions--for a definite kind of\r\nsediment or igneous rock, for a definite structure, for the right kind\r\nof mineralogic and metamorphic conditions, or for the right combination\r\nof these and other geologic elements. The geologic considerations used\r\nin exploration for the various mineral deposits are so many and so\r\ndiverse, and they require so much adjustment and interpretation in their\r\nlocal application, that one would be rash indeed to attempt anything in\r\nthe nature of an exhaustive discussion. It is hardly practicable to do\r\nmore than to outline, for illustrative purposes, a few of the geologic\r\nfactors most commonly used in exploration.\r\n\r\n\r\nMINERAL PROVINCES AND EPOCHS\r\n\r\nMineral deposits may be similar in their mineralogic and geologic\r\ncharacters and relations over a considerable area. They may give\r\nevidence of having developed under the same general conditions of\r\norigin; perhaps they may even be of the same geologic age. The\r\ngold-silver deposits of Goldfield, of Tonopah, the Comstock Lode of\r\nVirginia City, and many other deposits through the Great Basin area of\r\nthe southwestern United States and Mexico have group characteristics\r\nwhich have led geologists to refer to this area as a \"metallogenic\" or\r\n\"metallographic\" province. The gold-silver ores on the west slope of the\r\nSierra Nevadas, for nearly the entire length of California, likewise\r\nconstitute a metallogenic province. The Lake Superior copper ores on the\r\nsouth shore of Lake Superior, the silver ores on the north shore,\r\nmiscellaneous small deposits of copper, silver, and gold ores to the\r\neast of Lake Superior, the nickel ores of Sudbury, and the\r\nsilver-nickel-cobalt ores of the Cobalt district are all characterized\r\nby similar groups of minerals (though in highly differing proportions),\r\nby similar geologic associations, by similar age, and probably by\r\nsimilar conditions of origin. This area is a metallogenic province. The\r\nlead and zinc ores of the Mississippi Valley constitute another such\r\nprovince. The oil pools of the principal fields are characterized by\r\ncommon geologic conditions over great areas (p. 149), which may likewise\r\nbe considered as forming mineral provinces; for them the term\r\n\"petroliferous provinces\" has been used. The list might be extended\r\nindefinitely. Knowledge of such group distributions of minerals is a\r\nvaluable asset to the explorer, in that it tends to localize and direct\r\nsearch for certain classes of ores in certain provinces; also, within a\r\nprovince, it tells the explorer what is to be normally expected as\r\nregards kinds and occurrences of mineral deposits. In searching for\r\nminerals of sedimentary origin, the explorer will use stratigraphic\r\nmethods in following definite sedimentary horizons. In searching for\r\nores related to igneous intrusions he will naturally hunt for the\r\nintrusions, and then follow the periphery of the intrusions for\r\nevidences of mineralization, taking into account possible features of\r\nzonal arrangement of minerals about the intrusives (see pp. 42-44), and\r\nthe preference of the ores for certain easily replaced horizons like\r\nlimestones, or for certain planes or zones of fracturing.\r\n\r\nJust as minerals may be grouped by provinces, they may be grouped by\r\ngeologic ages. Such groupings are especially useful in the case of\r\nminerals which are closely related to certain stratigraphic horizons,\r\nsuch as coal, oil, and iron. The greater number of the productive coal\r\ndeposits of the United States are of Carboniferous age, and the\r\ndistribution of sediments of this age is pretty well understood from\r\ngeneral geologic mapping. The Clinton iron ores all follow one general\r\nhorizon in the lower-middle Paleozoic. The Lake Superior iron ores are\r\npre-Cambrian, and over three-fourths of them occur at one horizon in the\r\npre-Cambrian. Gold deposits of the United States were formed mainly in\r\nthe pre-Cambrian, the early Cretaceous, and the Tertiary. Copper\r\ndeposits of the United States were formed chiefly in pre-Cambrian,\r\nCretaceous, and Tertiary time. While there are many exceptions and\r\nmodifications to general classifications of this sort, they seem to\r\nexpress essential geologic facts which can be made very useful in\r\nlocalizing exploration.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASSIFICATION OF MINERAL LANDS\r\n\r\nIn recent years there has been considerable development of the practice\r\nof classifying mineral lands in given areas for purposes of exploration\r\nand valuation, or for purposes of formulation and administration of\r\ngovernment laws. This has been done both by private interests and by the\r\ngovernment. These classifications take into account all of the geologic\r\nand economic factors ascertainable. The classes of mineral land\r\ndesignated vary with the mineral, the district, and the purpose for\r\nwhich the classification is made.\r\n\r\nCommon procedure for commercial exploration purposes is to divide the\r\nlands of a given territory into three groups--(1) lands which are\r\ndefinitely promising for mineral exploration, (2) lands of doubtful\r\npossibilities, and (3) lands in which the mineral possibilities are so\r\nslight that they may be excluded from practical consideration. Each of\r\nthese classes may be subdivided for special purposes. Another commonly\r\nused classification is, (1) proved mineral lands, (2) probable mineral\r\nlands, usually adjacent to producing mines, (3) possible mineral lands,\r\nand (4) commercially unpromising mineral lands.\r\n\r\nThe classification of the public mineral lands by government agencies is\r\nfully discussed by George Otis Smith and others in a bulletin of the\r\nUnited States Geological Survey.[37] The purposes, methods, and results\r\nof this classification should be familiar to every explorer. Nowhere\r\nelse is there available such a vast body of information of practical\r\nvalue. Quoting from this report:\r\n\r\n     A study of the land laws shows the absolute necessity of some\r\n     form of segregation of the lands into classes as a\r\n     prerequisite to their disposition. Agricultural entry may not\r\n     be made on lands containing valuable minerals, nor coal entry\r\n     on lands containing gold, silver, or copper; lands included in\r\n     desert entries or selected under the Carey Act must be desert\r\n     lands; enlarged-homestead lands must not be susceptible of\r\n     successful irrigation; placer claims must not be taken for\r\n     their timber value or their control of watercourses; and lands\r\n     included in building-stone, petroleum, or salt placers must be\r\n     more valuable for those minerals than for any other purpose.\r\n     So through the whole scheme of American land laws runs the\r\n     necessity for determining the use for which each tract is best\r\n     fitted.\r\n\r\nFor this purpose the Geological Survey has made extensive classification\r\nof coal lands, oil and gas lands, phosphate lands, lands bearing potash\r\nand related salines, metalliferous mineral lands, miscellaneous\r\nnon-metalliferous mineral lands, and water resources. The scope of the\r\nwork may be indicated by the factors considered. For instance coal is\r\ninvestigated in relation to its character and heat-giving qualities\r\n(whence comes its value), quantity, thickness, depth, and other\r\nconditions that effect the cost of its extraction. Metalliferous mineral\r\nlands are considered in relation to general geology, country rock,\r\nintrusions and metamorphism, structure, outcrops and float of lodes,\r\nprospects and mines, samples, and history of the region.\r\n\r\nClassifications of this kind have often proved useful to large holders\r\nof land as a basis for intelligent handling of problems of sale,\r\ntaxation, and the granting of rights to explorers. Because of the lack\r\nof this elementary information, there has been in some quarters timidity\r\nabout dealing with large holdings, for fear of parting with possible\r\nfuture mineral wealth,--with the result that such tracts are carried at\r\nlarge expense and practically removed from the field of exploration. To\r\nthe same cause may be attributed some of the long delays on the part of\r\nthe government in opening lands for mineral entry or in issuing patents\r\non land grants.\r\n\r\n\r\nOUTCROPS OF MINERAL DEPOSITS\r\n\r\nMany mineral deposits have been found because they outcrop at the\r\nsurface; the discoveries may have been by accident or they may have been\r\naided by consideration of geologic factors. There are still vast\r\nunexplored areas in which mineral deposits are likely to be found\r\nstanding out at the surface. For much of the world, however, the surface\r\nhas been so thoroughly examined that the easy surface discoveries have\r\nbeen made, and the future is likely to see a larger application of\r\nscientific methods to ground where the outcrops do not tell an obvious\r\nstory. Mineral deposits may fail to outcrop because of covering by\r\nweathered rock or soil, by glacial deposits, or by younger formations\r\n(surface igneous flows or sediments), or the outcrop of a deposit may be\r\nso altered by weathering as to give little clue to the uninitiated as to\r\nwhat is beneath. Mineral deposits formed in older geologic periods have\r\nin most cases been deeply covered by later sediments and igneous rocks.\r\nSuch deposits are in reach of exploration from the surface only in\r\nplaces where erosion has partly or wholly removed the later covering. An\r\nillustration of this condition is furnished in the Great Basin district\r\nof Nevada, where ore bodies have been covered by later lava flows. The\r\nore-bearing districts are merely islands exposed by erosion in a vast\r\nsea of lava and surface sediments. Beyond reasonable doubt many more\r\ndeposits are so covered than are exposed, and it is no exaggeration to\r\nsay that by far the greater part of the mineral wealth of the earth may\r\nnever be found. Where a mineral-bearing horizon is exposed by erosion at\r\nthe surface, underground operations may follow this horizon a long way\r\nbelow the capping rocks; but, after all, such operations are\r\ngeographically small as compared with the vast areas over which the\r\ncovering rocks give no clue as to what is beneath. One of the principal\r\nproblems of economic geology for the future is to develop means for\r\nexploration in territories of this sort. A beginning has been made in\r\nvarious districts by the use of reconnaissance drilling, combined with\r\ninterpretation of all the geologic and structural features. The\r\ndiscovery of one of the largest nickel deposits in the Sudbury district\r\nof Canada was made by reconnaissance drilling to ascertain the general\r\ngeologic features, in an area so deeply covered as to give little\r\nsuggestion as to the proper location for attack.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME ILLUSTRATIVE CASES\r\n\r\nThe use of outcrops in oil exploration has been noted on other pages\r\n(pp. 146-147).\r\n\r\nOutcrops of coal seams may be found in folded or deeply eroded areas.\r\nFor the most part, however, and especially in areas of flat-lying rocks,\r\nthe presence of coal is inferred from stratigraphic evidence and from\r\nthe general nature of the geologic section--which has been determined by\r\noutcrops of associated rocks or by information available at some distant\r\npoint. The structural mapping of coal beds on the basis of outcrops and\r\ndrill holes has been referred to (pp. 126-127).\r\n\r\nIron ores are very resistant to solution. Where hard and compact they\r\ntend to form conspicuous outcrops, and where soft they may be pretty\r\nwell covered by clay and soil. In glaciated areas, like the Lake\r\nSuperior region, outcrops of iron ore are much less numerous because of\r\nthe drift covering. Certain of the harder iron ores of the Marquette,\r\nGogebic and Menominee districts of Michigan and of the Vermilion\r\ndistrict of Minnesota project in places through the glacial drift, and\r\nthese ores were the first and most easily found. Much the greater\r\nnumber of iron ore deposits of Lake Superior, including the great soft\r\ndeposits of the Mesabi range of Minnesota, fail to outcrop. On the other\r\nhand the _iron formation_, or mother rock of the ore, is hard and\r\nresistant and outcrops are numerous. The hematite ores of Brazil have\r\nmany features in common with the Lake Superior ores in age and\r\noccurrence, but they have not been covered with glacial deposits.\r\nOutcrops of the iron ore are large and conspicuous, and the surface in\r\nthis territory gives one some idea of what the Lake Superior region may\r\nhave looked like before the glaciers came along. Certain of the soft\r\niron ores of the lateritic type, as in Cuba, outcrop over great areas\r\nwhere their topographic situation is such that erosion has not swept\r\nthem off. On erosion slopes they are seldom found. The Clinton iron ores\r\nof the southeastern United States outcrop freely.\r\n\r\nSome of the lead and zinc deposits of the Mississippi Valley outcrop at\r\nthe grass roots as varying mixtures of iron oxide, galena, chert, and\r\nclay, though they seldom project above the general surface. The old lead\r\nranges of Wisconsin and Illinois, found at the surface a century ago by\r\nthe early explorers and traders, have served as starting points for\r\ndeeper exploration which has located the zinc deposits. Erosion channels\r\nhave freely exposed these ore bodies, and in the Wisconsin-Illinois\r\ndeposits most of the ores thus far found are confined to the vicinity of\r\nthese channels. The greater number of the lead and zinc deposits of the\r\nMississippi Valley, however, are covered with weathered material or with\r\noutliers of overlying sediments, with the result that underground\r\nexploration is necessary to locate them.\r\n\r\nSulphide deposits in general, including those carrying gold, silver,\r\ncopper, lead, zinc, and other metals, have many common features of\r\noutcrop. The iron sulphide commonly present in these ore bodies is\r\noxidized to limonite at the surface, with the result that prospectors\r\nlook for iron-stained rocks. These iron-stained rocks are variously\r\ncalled the \"gossan,\" the \"iron capping,\" the \"colorado,\" or the\r\n\"eiserner Hut\" (iron hat). The gossan is likely to resist erosion and to\r\nbe conspicuous at the surface,--though this depends largely on the\r\nrelative resistance of the wall rocks, and on whether the gangue is a\r\nhard material like quartz, or some material which weathers more rapidly\r\nlike limestone or igneous rock. The gossan does not often carry much\r\nvalue, though it may show traces of minerals which suggest what may be\r\nfound below. Gold, silver, and lead are not easily leached out of the\r\nsurface outcrops. Copper and zinc are much more readily leached, and in\r\nthe outcrop may disclose their existence only by traces of staining. It\r\nhappens not infrequently, therefore, that copper and zinc deposits are\r\nfound through the downward exploitation of oxidized gold, silver, and\r\nlead ores. The veins at Butte were first worked for silver, and the ore\r\nbodies at Bingham, Utah, and Jerome, Arizona, were first mined for gold.\r\nExceptionally, copper ore in enriched, oxidized form outcrops, as at\r\nBisbee, Arizona.\r\n\r\nIt is not always true that valuable sulphide deposits have an\r\niron-stained outcrop, for in some of them iron sulphide or pyrite is so\r\nscarce that the surface outcrops may be light-colored clayey and\r\nsiliceous rocks.\r\n\r\nSilver is often represented in the outcrop by silver chloride or\r\ncerargyrite, which may be easily identified. The prospecting for such\r\nsurface ores is sometimes called \"chloriding.\"\r\n\r\nThe presence in the outcrop of dark manganese oxides associated with\r\nvein quartz sometimes indicates the presence below of copper and zinc\r\nand other minerals, as at Butte.\r\n\r\nExtensive alterations of the country rock in the way of silicification\r\nand sericitization, and the presence of minerals like garnet,\r\ntourmaline, diopside, and others, known to be commonly deposited by the\r\nsame hot solutions which make many ore deposits, may furnish a clue for\r\nexploration below. These characteristics of the country rock, however,\r\nare likely to be masked at the outcrop by later weathering, which\r\nsuperposes a kaolinic or clayey alteration.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOPOGRAPHY AND CLIMATE AS AIDS IN SEARCHING FOR MINERAL OUTCROPS\r\n\r\nThe topographic expression of a mineral deposit depends upon its\r\nhardness and resistance to erosion as compared with the adjacent rocks.\r\nIf more resistant it will stand out at the surface; if less resistant,\r\nit will form a depression. The conditions determining resistance are\r\nexceedingly variable, and no broad generalization can be made; but\r\nwithin a local province a given group of mineral deposits may\r\ncharacteristically form depressions or ridges, and thus topographic\r\ncriteria may be very useful in exploration. Even with such limitations,\r\nthe variations of the topographic factor may be so great as to require\r\nmuch care in its use. Sulphide ores in quartzites are likely to develop\r\ndepressions under erosion. In limestones they are more likely to stand\r\nout in relief, because of the softer character of the limestone, though\r\nthis does not always work out. Crystalline magnetite and hematite are\r\nmore resistant to erosion than almost any other type of rock, and stand\r\nout at the surface with proportional frequency.\r\n\r\nClimatic conditions may determine the locus of search for certain\r\nsurface minerals. Bauxite and lateritic iron ores, for instance, are\r\nknown to favor tropical climates. In exploration for these minerals, the\r\nclimatic factor must be applied in connection with the topographic\r\nconsiderations already mentioned, and both, in turn, in connection with\r\nthe character of the country rock as determined by general geologic\r\nsurveys. A combination of climatic, topographic, and other physiographic\r\nconditions may be used also in exploration for certain types of residual\r\nclays.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIZE AND DEPTH OF ORE BODIES AS DETERMINED FROM OUTCROP\r\n\r\nWhere the ore body is harder than the surrounding rock, it stands out in\r\nconspicuous outcrops and is likely to show a narrowing below. Where it\r\nis softer than the surrounding rocks, and outcrops in a topographic\r\ndepression, it is perhaps more likely to show widening below. These\r\nfeatures are due to the general facts that, where the ore body is hard\r\nand resistant, the downward progress of erosion is likely to be arrested\r\nwhere the adjacent rocks occupy the larger part of the surface, that is,\r\nwhere the ore body is narrower. This principle is often vaguely\r\nrecognized in the assumption that an exceptionally large outcrop of an\r\nore vein may be \"too good to last.\" Again, such a generalization must be\r\napplied to a specific case with much caution.\r\n\r\nAttempts to forecast the depth of veins from their extent at the surface\r\nmeet with only partial success. In a very general way great persistence\r\nhorizontally suggests persistence in depth, on the ground that the\r\nsection exposed on the surface is as likely to be a section of average\r\ndimensions as one along vertical lines.\r\n\r\nFaith is the first article of the prospector's creed, and it is hard to\r\nshake his conviction that every ore outcrop must widen and improve\r\nbelow. As expressed by the French-Canadian prospector in the Cobalt\r\ndistrict, the \"vein calcite can't go up, she must go down.\" While the\r\nscientist may have grounds to doubt this reasoning, he is not often in a\r\nposition to offer definite negative evidence.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE USE OF PLACERS IN TRACING MINERAL OUTCROPS\r\n\r\nOutcrops of ore-bearing rock may occasionally be located by tracing a\r\nplacer deposit back to its source, or by following up ore fragments in\r\nthe \"wash\" on mountain sides to the place of origin, or by noting ore\r\nfragments in glacial deposits. The presence of an ore mineral in a\r\nplacer naturally raises the question as to whence it came. If it is a\r\nrecent placer, it may be comparatively easy to follow up the stream\r\nchannels to the head-water territory which is delivering the main mass\r\nof sediment, and there to locate a vein in place. The problem is\r\ncomplicated by multiplicity of tributaries and by large size of the\r\ndrainage areas. In such cases careful panning and testing of the gravels\r\nat frequent intervals may show which of several tributaries are\r\ncontributing most of the values, and thus may further localize the area\r\nof search. Many important mining districts, including Butte, Bisbee, the\r\nMother Lode region of southern California, the diamond fields of Africa,\r\nand others, have been found by tracing up placers in this manner. In the\r\ncase of an older placer deposit, where the topography and drainage have\r\nbeen much altered since its formation, or where the deposit has been\r\ncovered by later sediments, the problem is of course much more\r\ndifficult.\r\n\r\nMuch less than a commercially valuable placer deposit in unconsolidated\r\nsurface rocks may start a search for the mother lode. A single fragment\r\nof ore in the \"wash\" naturally directs attention up the slope, and the\r\nrepetition of fragments in a certain direction may lead unerringly to\r\nthe source. The fragments may not even in themselves carry value, but\r\nmay consist of detrital material from the leached outcrop--such as iron\r\nor manganese oxides, which, because of their red or black color, stand\r\nout conspicuously in the rock debris.\r\n\r\nIn the Lake Superior region large angular fragments of iron ore or iron\r\nformation in the glacial drift immediately raise question as to source.\r\nIf the fragments are rounded and small, they usually indicate a very\r\ndistant source. The general direction of glacial movement is known in\r\nmost places, and by tracing up the fragments in this direction the\r\noutcrop may be found; or the chain of fragments may be traced to a point\r\nwhere they stop, which point may serve to locate the parent bedrock\r\ncarrying the ore body, even though it does not outcrop.\r\n\r\nAn interesting suggestion was made some years ago with reference to the\r\ndiamonds found sporadically in the terminal moraines in Wisconsin and\r\nother mid-west states. The diamonds are of such size and quality as to\r\nindicate surely the existence of a real diamond field somewhere to the\r\nnorth. The locations of these diamond finds were platted on a glacial\r\nmap, and lines were projected in a general northerly direction along the\r\nknown lines of the glacial movement. It was found that these lines\r\nconverged at a point near Hudson's Bay. The data were too meager and the\r\nbase line too short for this long projection, and the indicated source\r\nof the diamonds can be regarded as the merest speculation. However, with\r\nthe finding of additional diamonds in the drift, as seems very likely,\r\nthe refinement of this method might conceivably bring results in time.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE USE OF MAGNETIC SURVEYS IN TRACING MINERAL LEDGES\r\n\r\nMagnetic surveys are often useful in tracing iron-bearing rocks beneath\r\nthe surface, in the discovery of outcrops of such rocks, and in working\r\nout their lines of connection. This method is in general use for the\r\ncrystalline iron ores in the Lake Superior region, Canada, the\r\nAdirondacks, and elsewhere in the glaciated portions of the United\r\nStates. It is not so useful for the brown ores and the Clinton ores of\r\nthe southeastern United States, which are only slightly magnetic and can\r\nbe commonly located by other methods.\r\n\r\nWhere the ore is strongly magnetic, and is associated with other rocks\r\nwhich are non-magnetic, the nature of the magnetic field determined by a\r\nsurface survey with vertical and horizontal needles may tell something\r\nabout the shape and size of the ore body. Commonly, however, magnetic\r\nores are associated with leaner magnetic rocks,--with the result that\r\nthe magnetic survey, unless it happens to lead to an outcrop of ore,\r\nindicates only the general area through which underground exploration\r\nmight be warranted. In the hematitic iron ores of Lake Superior,\r\nmagnetism is less pronounced than in the magnetites; and in the soft\r\nhydrous hematites, like those of the Mesabi district, it may cause only\r\nslight disturbance of the magnetic needle. This disturbance is usually\r\nsufficient to locate the position of the iron-bearing formation, though\r\nnot the position of the ore.\r\n\r\nWhere the iron formation has been highly metamorphosed, and rendered\r\nresistant to weathering and erosion so that it will not concentrate into\r\nore, it is likely to have higher magnetic attraction than the richer\r\nores. For this reason an area of strong magnetic attraction is\r\nordinarily regarded as not particularly favorable to the finding of\r\nimportant hematite deposits. However, this attraction may be very useful\r\nin tracing out the formation to a place where it is less metamorphic,\r\nless resistant to erosion, less likely to outcrop, and yet more\r\npromising for the discovery of iron ore. For instance, on the east end\r\nof the Mesabi and on the east and west ends of the Gogebic district,\r\nmagnetic surveys trace the iron formation with great ease to points\r\nwhere the attraction is low and the conditions for exploration more\r\nfavorable.\r\n\r\nThe magnetic needle has also been used in the search for nickel ore in\r\nthe Sudbury district of Ontario, but without great success, because of\r\nthe variety of rocks other than nickel which are more or less magnetic,\r\nand because of the slight magnetic properties of the nickel ore itself.\r\nIn a large-scale exploration of this type, conducted some years ago, a\r\nfavorable magnetic belt was discovered, and a pit was sunk to water\r\nlevel but not to bedrock. Years later, the extension of this pit by only\r\na few feet disclosed one of the great ore bodies of the district.\r\n\r\nExperimental work on the use of the magnetic needle on copper deposits\r\nhas yielded some interesting and suggestive results, but this\r\ninvestigation is still under way and the results have not been\r\npublished.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE USE OF ELECTRICAL CONDUCTIVITY AND OTHER QUALITIES OF ROCKS IN\r\nEXPLORATION\r\n\r\nIn addition to magnetism, rocks and ores have other properties\r\nsusceptible to observations made at a distance, such as electrical\r\nconductivity, transparency to X-rays, specific induction, elasticity,\r\nand density. All these qualities have been of interest to geologists in\r\nsome connection or another, but none of them have yet been used\r\neffectively in exploration for mineral resources. The only one of these\r\nproperties that has thus far seemed to promise practical results is\r\nelectrical conductivity. The results yet obtained are slight, and this\r\nkind of investigation has rested under something of a cloud, due to\r\nextravagant claims of inventors. Nevertheless, there has been a\r\nconsiderable amount of scientific work by physicists, geologists, and\r\nengineers, supplemented by special war-time investigations of rock and\r\nearth conductivity in connection with ground telephones and the tapping\r\nof enemy conversations, which seems to indicate a distinct possibility\r\nof practical results in the future,--perhaps not so much in locating\r\nspecific ore bodies as in locating general types of formation and\r\nstructures,--which may serve to supplement other methods of search.[38]\r\n\r\nThe transmission and reflection of sound waves in rocks have also been\r\nmore or less investigated with reference to their possible military use.\r\nIt seems not impossible that these phenomena may be of some geologic aid\r\nin the future, but experimental work is yet in a very early stage.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE USE OF STRUCTURE AND METAMORPHISM IN EXPLORATION\r\n\r\nThe necessity for careful use of structural data in exploration scarcely\r\nrequires discussion. References have been made to structural features in\r\nconnection with coal, oil, iron ore, and other minerals. This phase of\r\nstudy can scarcely be too intensively followed. The tracing of a folded\r\nor faulted vein, in a particularly complex system of veins, requires\r\napplication of all of the methods and principles of structural geology.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the importance of applying the principles of metamorphism,\r\nembodied in the _metamorphic cycle_ (pp. 27-28) is almost self-evident.\r\nCertain kinds of metamorphism are suggestive of the nature of the\r\nmineral deposits with which they are associated. One would not look for\r\nminerals known to be caused mainly by surficial processes in rocks which\r\nhave been altered mainly by deep-seated processes. The presence of\r\nmetamorphism indicating high temperatures and pressures to some extent\r\nlimits the kinds of minerals which one may expect to find. On the other\r\nhand, minerals known to be primarily formed at great depths, providing\r\nthey are resistant to surface weathering, may be found in deposits which\r\nare the result of surficial alterations or katamorphic processes; that\r\nis, they may become concentrated as residual materials in weathered\r\nzones or as placers.\r\n\r\n\r\nDRILLING IN EXPLORATION\r\n\r\nIn the absence of distinctive outcrops, as well as when outcrops are\r\nfound, drilling is a widely used method of underground exploration in\r\nadvance of the sinking of shafts or the driving of tunnels. Drilling is\r\nmore useful in the locating and proving of mineral deposits of large\r\nbulk, like deposits of coal, iron, and oil, than mineral deposits of\r\nsmall bulk and high value, like gold and silver deposits. However, it is\r\nnot always used in the exploration of the first class of deposits and is\r\nnot always eliminated in the exploration of the second class. With the\r\ndevelopment of better mechanical devices, better methods of controlling\r\nand ascertaining the direction of the drill hole, and more skillful\r\ninterpretation of drill samples, the use of drilling is rapidly\r\nextending into mineral fields where it was formerly thought not\r\napplicable.\r\n\r\nThe geologist takes an active part in drilling operations by locating\r\nthe drill holes, by determining the angle of the holes, by identifying\r\nand interpreting the samples, by studying bedding, cleavage, and other\r\nstructures as shown in the samples, and determining the attitude of\r\nthese structures in the ground, by determining when the horizon is\r\nreached which is most promising for mineral, and by determining when the\r\nhole shall be stopped. With a given set of surface conditions, the\r\nproblem of locating and directing a drill hole to secure the maximum\r\npossible results for the amount expended requires the careful\r\nconsideration of many geologic factors,--and, what is more important,\r\ntheir arrangement in proper perspective and relationship. Faulty\r\nreasoning from any one of the principal factors, or over-emphasis on any\r\none of them, or failure to develop an accurate three-dimensional\r\nconception of the underground structural conditions, may lead to failure\r\nor extra expense. Success or failure is swiftly and definitely\r\ndetermined. The geologist is usually employed by the company financing\r\nthe drilling; but in recognition of the importance of his work, some of\r\nthe large contracting drill companies now employ their own geologists.\r\nThe technique of the geologic interpretation and direction of drilling\r\nhas become rather complicated and formidable, and has resulted in the\r\nintroduction of special college courses in these subjects.\r\n\r\nThe desirability of public registration of drilling records is discussed\r\non another page (pp. 305-306).\r\n\r\n\r\nQUANTITATIVE ASPECTS OF GEOLOGIC EXPLORATION\r\n\r\nIn recent years there has been a tendency to reduce the geologic factors\r\nin exploration to some kind of a quantitative basis. While these factors\r\nmay be very variable and very complex, their net effect frequently may\r\nbe expressed in terms of quantitative averages. In various mines and\r\nmining districts where operations are of wide extent, local quantitative\r\nfactors have been worked out which are useful in predicting results from\r\nproposed explorations in undeveloped portions. Figures of this sort may\r\nbe useful and practical guides in planning any given exploration, its\r\ncost, and its probable outcome.\r\n\r\nQuantitative methods are illustrated in the general account of Lake\r\nSuperior iron ore exploration in a later section.\r\n\r\nCurves of production from oil wells and from oil districts have been\r\nfound to have certain characteristic features in common which are often\r\nused in predicting the future output and life of a given well, property,\r\nor district. Where associated with coal, the percentage of fixed carbon\r\nin the coal may be a guide to the presence and nature of the oil (see\r\nChapter VIII).\r\n\r\nThe geological staff of the Netherlands East Indies estimated the tin\r\nreserves of one of these islands by the use of a factor or coefficient,\r\nbased on the experience of another island.\r\n\r\nIn the Cobalt district of Canada a factor for future discoveries and\r\noutput, based on past experience, was similarly developed.\r\n\r\nHoover[39] made a statistical study of several hundred metal mines in\r\nvarious parts of the world, and found that not 6 per cent of the mines\r\nthat yielded profits ever made them from ore mined below 2,000 feet; and\r\nthat of the mines that paid dividends, 80 per cent did not yield profit\r\nbelow 1,500 feet, and most of them died above 500 feet.\r\n\r\nAttempt has been made by a Swedish geologist to estimate the iron ore\r\nresources of continents by the use of an iron coefficient. This\r\ncoefficient was obtained by dividing the known iron ore resources of the\r\ncomparatively well-investigated portions of the world by the number of\r\nsquare miles in which they occurred, and was then multiplied into the\r\narea of the continents whose resources were to be determined.\r\n\r\nThe application of quantitative methods of this kind has not yet become\r\nvery general, nor is it possible to use them in some cases; where\r\napplied many of them have been very crude and others have been partly\r\ndisproved by experience. With increasing knowledge and experience, such\r\nmethods are becoming more accurate and useful, and are likely to have\r\nwider use in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGIN OF MINERAL DEPOSITS AS A FACTOR IN EXPLORATION\r\n\r\nIn exploration, the geologist is keen to ascertain the origin of the\r\nmineral deposit. This is often a source of wonder to the layman or\r\n\"practical\" man, and the geologist may be charged with having let his\r\nfondness for theory run away with him. A widespread fatalistic\r\nconception is expressed in the Cornishman's dictum on ore, \"Where it is,\r\nthere it is.\" Yet an understanding of the origin of any particular ore,\r\nthe \"why\" of it, is coming to be recognized as the most effective means\r\nof reaching sound practical conclusions. By ascertaining the approximate\r\norigin of the ore, it may be possible at once to infer a whole group of\r\npractical considerations based on experience with ores of like origin in\r\nother localities. The origin of the ore is the geologist's primary\r\ninterest, and it is this which gives him his most effective and\r\ndistinctive tool in exploration. Many other phases of exploration work\r\nmay be picked up empirically by any one familiar with the local\r\nconditions; but when the man without sound geologic training attempts to\r\ngo into this particular field, his lack of background and perspective\r\noften leads to fantastic hypotheses which may vitiate the inferences on\r\nwhich he plans his exploration.\r\n\r\nThe scientific investigator, while not accepting the fanciful theories\r\nof the local observer, will make a mistake if he fails to recognize the\r\nresiduum of solid fact on which they are built. Many practical explorers\r\nare shrewd observers of empirical facts, even though their explanations\r\nmay show a lack of comprehension of the processes involved. Any\r\nassumption of superiority, intolerance, or lack of sympathy, on the part\r\nof the geologist, toward the inadequate explanations and descriptions\r\ngiven him by the practical man, is likely to indicate a weakness or\r\nlimitation in his own mental processes. The geologist's business is to\r\nsift out the fact from the inference, and not to throw over the whole\r\nstructure because some of the inferences are faulty.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAKE SUPERIOR IRON ORE EXPLORATION AS AN ILLUSTRATION\r\n\r\nTo illustrate the application of some of the methods of exploration of\r\nthe kinds described in this chapter, the writer selects an example from\r\nhis own experience in the Lake Superior iron fields.[40]\r\n\r\nIn this region, consideration of the economic aspects of the problem may\r\neliminate from the best explorable field certain Canadian portions which\r\nare far from water transportation, because the conditions in these\r\nsections would prevent the use of anything but an exceptionally large\r\nand rich deposit. Economic conditions determine in advance also that it\r\nis not worth while looking for ores of certain grades, either because\r\nthey are not usable on account of deleterious constituents or low\r\ncontent of iron, or because these particular grades have already been\r\ndeveloped in excess of requirements. Having determined what ore is\r\ndesired, whether Bessemer or non-Bessemer, whether open-hearth or\r\nfoundry, further elimination of area is possible on the basis of past\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nComing to the geologic phases of the problem, the first step is to\r\neliminate great areas of rock which are known never to contain iron ore,\r\nlike the granite areas and the quartzite and limestone areas. Within the\r\nremaining areas, by examination of the surface outcrops and with the aid\r\nof magnetic surveys, iron formations are found which are the mother rock\r\nof the ores. In Michigan, it has been possible to use certain percentage\r\nexpectations in the areal location of iron formations within certain\r\nseries of rocks extending over wide areas. Such percentage coefficients\r\nhave been useful, not only in exploration, but also in the valuation of\r\nlands which are so covered with drift that no one knows whether they\r\ncarry an iron formation or not.\r\n\r\nExamination of the iron formations results in elimination of large parts\r\nof them, because their metamorphic condition is not favorable to ore\r\nconcentration. In the remaining areas more intensive methods are\r\nfollowed. It is scarcely possible to summarize briefly all of the\r\nstructural and stratigraphic methods used in locating the ore bodies.\r\nThese have often been described in print.[41] Comparatively recent\r\nadvances in this phase of exploration work have been in the more\r\ndetailed application of stratigraphic methods to the iron formation. The\r\ngroup characteristics of the iron formation are fairly uniform and\r\ndistinctive as compared with all other rocks; yet within the iron\r\nformation there are so many different kinds of layers represented that\r\nit is possible to use these variations with great effectiveness, in\r\ncorrelating favorable horizons for ore deposition, in interpreting drill\r\nrecords, and in other ways. Another method of approach, employed chiefly\r\non the Mesabi Range, relates to the slumping of the ore layers which\r\nresults from the leaching of silica during the concentration of the ore.\r\nThis slumping can be measured quantitatively, and has been used to much\r\nadvantage in exploration, in correlation of ore horizons, in preparation\r\nof sections and ore estimates, etc.\r\n\r\nEarly geologic explorations in the Lake Superior country were based on\r\nthe assumption that the ores were concentrated by waters working down\r\nfrom the present erosion surface; but recognition of the fact that the\r\nwaters which did the work were related to a far older and different\r\nerosion surface, under conditions which allowed of a far deeper\r\npenetration, has modified exploration plans for certain of the districts\r\nlike the Marquette and Gogebic.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the complexity of the geologic factors involved, their\r\nnet result has been to concentrate iron ores in a surprisingly uniform\r\nratio to the mass of the formation in different parts of the\r\nregion,--with the result that on an average it may be predicted for any\r\ndistrict, in an exploration of sufficient magnitude, how much ore is\r\nlikely to be cut in either vertical or horizontal dimension. Thirteen\r\nper cent of the productive area of the Mesabi iron formation is iron\r\nore. For the remainder of the Lake Superior region five or six per cent\r\nis the factor. These figures mean that, if a person could explore a\r\nbroad enough area of iron formation, any miscellaneous group of drill\r\nholes or underground openings would tend to yield these percentage\r\nresults. Such percentages are amply sufficient to pay a large profit on\r\nthe exploration. The question may be raised why the application of\r\ngeology is required, if such average results can be secured from\r\nmiscellaneous undirected work. The answer is that seldom is it possible\r\nto conduct an exploration on a sufficiently large scale to be sure of\r\napproximating this average, and that geologic study has made it possible\r\nin many cases to secure a better percentage result. If the geologist is\r\nable to raise the percentage ever so little, the expenditure is amply\r\njustified. He is not expected to have 100 per cent success; but he is\r\nexpected to better the average returns, and in this on the whole he has\r\nnot failed.\r\n\r\nApplying this method specifically to the Gogebic Range, it appears that\r\nup to January 1, 1918, exploration and development had covered 3,650\r\nacres of iron formation, measured along the dip in the plane of the\r\nfootwall, within the limits of the area in which the formation is in\r\nsuch condition as to allow concentration of the ore. The total area of\r\nthe footwall to a depth of 3,000 feet is approximately 9,650 acres. The\r\nrange, therefore, was 38 per cent developed to this depth. In the\r\ndeveloped area, 160,000,000 tons of ore had been found, or approximately\r\none ton per square foot of footwall area, or 43,800 per acre of\r\nfootwall explored. The total area of ore measured on the footwall was\r\n785 acres. The ratio of ore area to total explored area, measured in the\r\nplane of the footwall, was 21-1/2 per cent. This may be taken in a rough\r\nway to indicate the average exploring possibilities in new ground, where\r\nlocal conditions to the contrary do not exist. This means that over the\r\nwhole range about one drill hole or cross-cut in five will strike ore on\r\nan average. Or, looked at in another way, about 200 feet of drifting in\r\nevery 1,000 on the footwall will be in ore. Applying this factor to the\r\nunexplored area, amounting to 6,000 acres, the range had an expectation\r\non January 1, 1918, to a depth of 3,000 feet, over and above ores\r\nalready discovered, of approximately 262,800,000 tons. This was\r\nsufficient to extend the life of the range by about forty-four years.\r\nKnowing the average cost of development of ore per foot in the past, and\r\nknowing the annual output and its rate of acceleration, it is possible\r\nto figure with some accuracy how much expenditure should be planned for\r\nannually in the future in order to maintain a safe margin of reserves\r\nagainst output.\r\n\r\nSuch quantitative considerations in the Lake Superior region serve not\r\nonly to guide the general conduct of the exploration and development\r\nwork, but in some cases as a basis for valuation both for commercial and\r\ntaxation purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEVELOPMENT AND EXPLOITATION OF MINERAL DEPOSITS\r\n\r\nThe search for new ore bodies is closely related to the development,\r\nextension, and mining of ore bodies already found. In this field the\r\ngeologist finds wide application of his science. Here he may not be so\r\nmuch concerned with the economic factors or with the broader methods of\r\ngeologic elimination; his study is more likely to be based mainly on the\r\nlocal geologic conditions.\r\n\r\nSome of the larger and more successful mining companies, perhaps the\r\ngreater number of them these days, have geologists whose business it is\r\nto follow closely the underground operations, with a view to advising on\r\nthe conduct of the development work. This requires the most precise and\r\nintensive study. For instance, the Anaconda Copper Mining Company has a\r\nstaff of several geologists, who follow the underground work in the\r\nutmost detail and whose approval must be obtained by the operating\r\ndepartment in the formulation of any development plan. The complexity\r\nand fault relations of the veins in this company's mines are such that\r\nthe application of these methods has abundantly justified itself on the\r\ncost sheet.\r\n\r\nToo often mining companies leave the planning and execution of the\r\nunderground development work to the local management, commonly to the\r\nunderground mining captain, without geologic consultation. This\r\nprocedure does not eliminate the economic geologist; for when the\r\ndevelopment fails at any point, or new and unexpected conditions are\r\nmet, the geologist is likely to be called in. In such cases the practice\r\nof a geologist is like that of the ordinary medical practitioner; he is\r\ncalled in only when his patients are in trouble. The use of adequate\r\ngeologic advice in the planning stages is about as little advanced in\r\nsome localities as the practice of preventive medicine.\r\n\r\nThe work of the economic geologist may not be ended by the finding and\r\ndevelopment of the ore; for the moment this is accomplished, he should\r\nagain consider the economic phases of the problem--the grade of his ore,\r\nits probable amount, and other features, in relation to the general\r\neconomic setting. In his enthusiasm for physical results, he may be\r\ncarried into expenditures not justified by the economic factors in the\r\nproblem. Some one else may and usually does look out for the economic\r\nelements, but the prudent geologist will at least see to it that someone\r\nis on the job.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[37] Smith, George Otis, and others, The classification of the public\r\nlands: _Bull. 537, U.S. Geol.

The mining industry supports a large\r\npopulation. These facts are the solid basis for the widespread popular\r\ninterest in mineral investment--and mineral speculation. But there are\r\nother reasons for this interest,--the gambler's chance for quick\r\nreturns, the \"lure of gold,\" the possibility of \"getting something for\r\nnothing,\" the mushroom nature of certain branches of the industry, the\r\nelement of mystery related to nature's secrets, and the conception of\r\nminerals as bonanzas with ready-made value, merely awaiting discovery\r\nand requiring no effort to make them valuable. In the United States a\r\nfactor contributing to the popular interest is the large freedom allowed\r\nby the laws to discover and acquire minerals on the public domain.\r\nPerhaps no other field of industry comes so near being common ground for\r\nall classes of people. The mineral industry is a field in which it is\r\neasy to capitalize not only honest and skillful endeavor, but hopes,\r\nguesses, and greed. It is not to be wondered at, therefore, that in the\r\npopular mind the valuation of a mineral resource is little more than a\r\nguess, and sometimes not even an honest one.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the mineral industry has become second only to agriculture\r\nin its capital value and in its earning capacity. In this industry it is\r\nhardly possible to arrive at valuations as securely based as in many\r\nother industries, but the elements of hazard are not so hopeless of\r\nmeasurement as might be supposed. The great mineral and financial\r\norganizations do not depend on mere guesses, but use well-tried methods.\r\nIf the general investor were to give more attention to these methods he\r\nwould doubtless save himself money, and the mineral industry would be\r\nrid of a great incumbrance of parasites who live on the credulity of the\r\npublic. To anyone familiar with the mineral field, it is often\r\nsurprising to see the rashness with which a conservative business man,\r\nwho would not think of entering another industrial field without close\r\nstudy of all the factors in the situation, will invest in minerals\r\nwithout using ordinary methods of analysis of values.\r\n\r\nIn the following account of valuation of minerals in the ground, and the\r\nclosely related subject, taxation of such minerals, the attempt is made\r\nto state some of the principles briefly and simply with a view to making\r\nthem intelligible to the layman. Values beyond the mine are concerned\r\nwith so many factors of a non-geologic nature that they are not here\r\ndiscussed.\r\n\r\n\r\nVALUATION AND TAXATION OF MINES\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRINSIC AND EXTRINSIC FACTORS IN VALUATION\r\n\r\nIt is essential to recognize at the outset that the value of a mineral\r\ndeposit, like the value of any other commercial material, comprises two\r\nmain elements; an intrinsic element based on the qualities of the\r\nmaterial itself, and an extrinsic element based on its availability and\r\nthe nature of the demands for it. The two elements may not be sharply\r\nseparated, and neither exists without the other. A mineral deposit in\r\neasy reach of a populous community, which has sufficiently advanced\r\nmethods and requirements to use it, may have high value; an exactly\r\nsimilar deposit, if far removed from points of consumption, handicapped\r\nby transportation, or available only to people without developed methods\r\nfor its use, may have little or no value. Intrinsically the deposits are\r\nalike; but extrinsically they are far different, and their values are\r\ncorrespondingly unlike. Even two adjacent properties, differently\r\nmanaged and controlled, and with different relations to markets, may\r\nhave somewhat different values depending on the use made of them. The\r\nvalue of a deposit may vary from year to year with changes in demand for\r\nits output, or with changes in metallurgical and other processes which\r\nmake its use possible. Minerals of small bulk and high value, as for\r\ninstance gold, platinum, and diamonds, have a nearly standard value\r\nrelated to their intrinsic properties, because they can be transported\r\nso easily to any part of the world. On the other hand, materials of\r\nlarge bulk and low unit value, such as coal, iron ore, and clay, may\r\nhave highly varying values independently of their physical\r\ncharacteristics, because of their relative immobility. But the values\r\neven of gold and precious stones represent a combination of intrinsic\r\nqualities and of demand. A diamond is made of carbon but is more\r\nvaluable than coal or graphite because it appeals to the esthetic taste.\r\nIt is only because man introduces an element of demand that the diamond\r\ntakes on value. In short, man is the multiplier and the mineral\r\nsubstance is the multiplicand in the product known as value.\r\n\r\nRecognition of the two elements of value is vital to a clear\r\nunderstanding of the methods and problems of valuation of minerals. It\r\nis too often assumed that the physical properties constitute the sole\r\nfactor.\r\n\r\nLooked at in a large way, the returns from the mineral industry are\r\ncommensurate with the effort put into discovery and development of\r\nmineral resources, even though the returns to lucky individuals have\r\nbeen excessive. In respect to the importance of the human energy\r\nelement, the mining of minerals is not unlike the cropping of soils.\r\nSome interesting economic studies have been made of mining districts to\r\nascertain whether the total return has been equal to the total\r\ninvestments by both successful and unsuccessful participants. The\r\nresults show that, even in some of the most successful districts, there\r\nis not a large \"social surplus,\"--that is, a surplus of receipts over\r\ntotal expenditures. It is difficult to generalize from such studies with\r\nany degree of accuracy; but it seems likely that if we could measure the\r\nvast amount of fruitless effort which has been expended in\r\nnon-productive territories, the result would tend to bear out the\r\ngeneral conclusion that the social surplus for the mineral industry as a\r\nwhole is a modest one, if it exists at all. Of course, it is to be\r\nremembered that the total benefits from mineral resources are not to be\r\nmeasured in terms of gain to the producers,--but that their measurement\r\nmust take into account the satisfying of all the complex demands of\r\nmodern civilization.\r\n\r\n\r\nVALUES OF MINERAL DEPOSITS NOT OFTEN ESTABLISHED BY MARKET TRANSFERS\r\n\r\nWhile minerals as extracted and used may have standard market values,\r\nmineral deposits in the ground are not bought and sold on the open\r\nmarket with sufficient frequency to establish standard market values. A\r\nsale may establish a criterion of value for the particular deposit, but\r\nnot for the class of deposits,--for no two mineral deposits are exactly\r\nalike. Stock quotations may establish a certain kind of market value,\r\nbut these are often vitiated by extraneous considerations. For these\r\nreasons the valuation of a mineral deposit is in each case a special\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AD VALOREM METHOD OF VALUATION\r\n\r\nThe ordinary commercial method of valuing mineral deposits recognizes\r\nthe two main elements of value above discussed. This method is sometimes\r\ncalled the _rational_ or _ad valorem_ method. The profit per ton (or per\r\nother unit) of the product is established, on the basis either of past\r\nperformance of the property or of experience with other similar\r\nproperties. This profit is multiplied by the total tonnage estimated in\r\nthe deposit, the estimate including known reserves, probable reserves,\r\nand in some cases possible and prospective reserves. The product of the\r\nprofit per ton and the total tonnage gives the total net amount which\r\nwill be received; it does not, however, give the present value, because\r\nthe commodity cannot all be taken out and sold at once, but must be\r\nmined and absorbed by the market through a considerable period of years.\r\nThe returns receivable some years in the future have obviously a lower\r\nproportionate present worth than amounts to be received at once. The\r\ninterest rate comes into play, making it necessary to discount each\r\nannual payment for the number of years which will elapse before it is\r\nreceived. It is evident, therefore, that an estimate of the _life_ of\r\nthe property is necessary, involving not only knowledge of the reserves,\r\nbut also a forecast of the annual extraction or _rate of depletion_.\r\n\r\nAs a simple case of _ad valorem_ valuation for illustrative purposes, a\r\ndeposit containing 1,000,000 tons in reserve has an estimated output of\r\n100,000 tons a year for ten years, on which the profit per ton has in\r\nthe past averaged $1 and is expected to average $1 in the future. Ten\r\nannual instalments or dividends of $100,000 are to be received. The\r\npresent value of the total of these instalments is figured by an annuity\r\nmethod. It is the value upon which the series of dividends will pay\r\ninterest at a predetermined rate, in addition to paying to a sinking\r\nfund annual instalments which, safely invested each year at a low rate\r\nof interest (usually 4%), will repay the present value at the end of the\r\nten years. In our hypothetical case, if an interest rate of 8% be taken,\r\nthe present value of $1,000,000, to be received through ten years in ten\r\nequal instalments, is $612,000. In other words, the sum of $612,000 will\r\nbe replaced by the sinking fund at the end of ten years, and will pay 8%\r\ninterest during this period,--this requiring total receipts of\r\n$1,000,000 in ten equal annual instalments. If the deposit here cited as\r\nan illustration were to be worked out in three years, thus yielding\r\nthree annual instalments of $333,000, its value would be $833,000.\r\n\r\nEach of the factors entering into this method of valuation covers a wide\r\nrange of variables, any one of which may be difficult to determine.\r\n\r\nThe profit per ton for a given deposit may have been extremely variable\r\nin the past, making it difficult to determine whether the highest or\r\nlowest figure should be projected into the future or whether some\r\naverage should be taken; and if an average, whether the time covered by\r\nthe average should be long or short. For a small, short-lived deposit\r\nobviously the most recent conditions would be taken into account in\r\nestimating future profits. For a long-lived property there would be more\r\ntendency to consider the long-time average vicissitudes, as reflected in\r\nthe average profits of the past. For some mineral commodities there are\r\ncycles of prices, costs, and profits, of more or less definite length,\r\nestablished during the long past history of the industry; and in such\r\ncases it is desirable in calculating averages to use a period covering\r\none or more of these cycles, rather than some shorter or longer period.\r\nFor many minerals, however, these cycles have been too irregular to\r\nafford a sound basis for future estimates. If the experience of the\r\nproperty itself is too short to afford a sufficient foundation for\r\nforecasting profits, or if there has been no previous work on the\r\nproperty, then it is necessary to use averages based on other\r\nproperties or other districts; or if there are none strictly\r\ncomparable, to build up a hypothetical figure from various estimated\r\ncosts of labor, supplies, and transportation, selling prices, etc. In\r\nthe estimate of the profit factor, the geologist is not primarily\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\nIn estimating the total reserves in a mine, geological considerations\r\nnearly always play a large part. An ore body may in some few cases be\r\ncompletely blocked out by underground work or drilling, eliminating the\r\nnecessity for inferring conditions beyond those actually seen; but in\r\nthe huge majority of mineral deposits the reserves are not so definitely\r\nknown, and it becomes necessary for the geologist, through knowledge of\r\nsimilar occurrences, through study of the structural features of the\r\ndeposit, its origin, and its history, to arrive at some sort of an\r\nestimate of reserves.\r\n\r\nIn estimating the life of a mineral deposit it is necessary to start\r\nwith the figure of total reserves, and from a study of conditions of\r\nmining and of markets to estimate the number of years necessary to\r\nexhaust the deposit. This is a more nearly commercial phase of the\r\nproblem, in which the geologist takes only part of the responsibility.\r\nPerhaps more estimates of value have gone wrong because of misjudgment\r\nof this factor than for any other cause. If the physical conditions are\r\nsatisfactory, it is easy to assume a rate of extraction and life based\r\non hope, which experience will not substantiate.\r\n\r\nThe choice of the interest rate to be used in discounting future\r\nreceipts to present worth likewise is a financial and not a geologic\r\nmatter. Again, however, the geologist must give consideration to this\r\nfactor, in view of the fact that the interest rate must be varied to\r\ncover the different degrees of hazard and doubt in the geologic factors.\r\nFor instance, to the extent to which the estimate of ore reserves is\r\ndoubtful, it is necessary to use a high rate of interest to allow for\r\nthis hazard. In a large, well-developed mineral deposit, with the\r\ngeological factors all well known and the demand and market well\r\nestablished, it is reasonable to use a lower rate of interest. In\r\ngeneral, the mineral industry is regarded in financial circles as being\r\nmore hazardous than many other industrial lines; and money is put into\r\nthe industry with the expectation of a high rate of interest, no matter\r\nhow safe the investment may be. In actual practice interest rates used\r\nin making valuations vary from 6 to 15 or 20 per cent.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that, where a property has long life, the interest will very\r\nmaterially reduce the present value of the ores to be mined far in the\r\nfuture. Reserves to be mined more than thirty years hence have\r\nrelatively little or no present value. Beyond a certain point,\r\ntherefore, the acquirement and holding of reserves for future use by\r\nprivate companies has little commercial justification. This is a matter\r\nwhich is too often not sufficiently well considered. Man's natural\r\nacquisitiveness often leads him into investments which, because of the\r\ntime and interest factor, have little chance of successful outcome. Of\r\ncourse a large corporation, anticipating an indefinitely long life, or\r\nperhaps aiming at monopoly, may afford to hold reserves as a matter of\r\ngeneral insurance longer than a small company,--even though, because of\r\nthe interest rate, these reserves have no present value on their books.\r\nIt is likewise true that governments, looking forward to the future of\r\nthe nation, and without the necessity of paying so much attention to\r\ninterest and taxes, are not so limited by this consideration.\r\n\r\nAn illustration of the limiting effect of the interest rate on the\r\nacquirement of long-lived coal deposits by private interests is\r\ndiscussed in Chapter XVII on Conservation. Investments made many years\r\nago have so augmented, even at low interest rates, as to make it\r\npractically impossible to count on a return of capital and interest; or\r\nif the return were to be exacted from the public it would mean excessive\r\ncharges, which are not possible in competition with other mines not so\r\nburdened.\r\n\r\nIn the commercial valuation of oil wells and pools, much the same method\r\nis used as has been described for mineral resources in the solid form,\r\nbut the estimate of reserves or life is based on consideration of curves\r\nof production of the sort mentioned on pages 134-136.\r\n\r\nThe essence of the _ad valorem_ method of valuation above described is\r\nincome-producing capacity. This method recognizes the fact that the\r\nvalue of the mineral deposit depends, not only on its physical\r\nconstitution, but also on what performance can be expected from it.\r\n\r\nStock quotations on mineral properties in the standard markets are based\r\nsubstantially on estimates of income capacity, more or less on the _ad\r\nvalorem_ basis. However, the quotations also reflect the hopes and fears\r\nof the public, often resulting in valuations quite different from those\r\nbased on studies of the objective conditions.\r\n\r\nThe war introduced new considerations into the problems of _ad valorem_\r\nvaluation. Under peace conditions there is a tendency toward the\r\nestablishment of normal costs, selling prices, and markets, which can be\r\ntaken more or less for granted by anyone attempting to value mineral\r\ndeposits. Under war and post-war conditions, few of these elements can\r\nbe taken for granted; it becomes necessary to consider the entire world\r\nsituation in regard to a mineral commodity, the effects of the Peace\r\nTreaty (which greatly concerns minerals), future international\r\nrelations, tariffs, and other matters of a similar sort. If a person\r\nwere today valuing a manganese deposit according to the method above\r\noutlined, and were to confine himself solely to a narrow consideration\r\nof past markets and profits on individual properties, he would be very\r\nlikely to go wrong,--for the world manganese situation has an immediate\r\nand practical bearing on each local problem (see pp. 173-176).\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER METHODS OF MINERAL VALUATION AND TAXATION\r\n\r\nWe have discussed the _ad valorem_ method of valuation at some length\r\nbecause it is the one in widest commercial use, and also because the\r\nprinciples involved underlie practically all other methods of mineral\r\nvaluation. The _ad valorem_ method is used in appraisals for taxation in\r\nsome districts and for some commodities, as, for instance, the iron\r\nmines of Michigan and Wisconsin. Its application, however, requires\r\nskill and judgment if equitable results are to be secured. For taxation\r\npurposes, therefore, it is not uncommon to adopt purely arbitrary or\r\nempirical methods which eliminate the element of judgment, and which\r\noften result in valuations quite different from those used commercially.\r\n\r\nThe state of Minnesota divides its iron ore deposits into a series of\r\nclasses, on each of which a more or less arbitrary flat value per ton is\r\nplaced, based on the spread between cost and selling price. The\r\nadjustments of flat values on the several classes through a series of\r\nyears, however, as well as the assigning of specific ores to the\r\ndifferent classes, have been based on the same factors as are used in\r\n_ad valorem_ valuations.\r\n\r\nThe state of Wisconsin uses a so-called \"equated income\" method of\r\nvaluation and taxation for the lead and zinc deposits of the\r\nsouthwestern part of the state. Under this method the state puts such a\r\ntax on the mine incomes for the preceding year as will yield\r\napproximately the same total return as under the _ad valorem_\r\nmethod,--the whole being based on the assumption that each deposit has\r\nabout the average life figured for the mines of the entire district. So\r\nfar as individual ore deposits vary from this average life, the value\r\nfixed departs from the true or _ad valorem_ value.\r\n\r\nSeveral states impose specific taxes based on the operations of the\r\nmines for the preceding year or for some combination of preceding years,\r\nas expressed in tonnage output or net profits or net proceeds,\r\nregardless of life or reserves. So far as output or net proceeds for a\r\nyear are proportional to the real value of the property, a rough\r\napproximation to equitable taxation as between mines is accomplished.\r\nOften, however, the valuation thus obtained has little relation to the\r\ntrue value, because it does not take into account the great differences\r\nbetween properties in reserves, in life, and in capacity for future\r\nprofit.\r\n\r\nIncome taxes, national and state, are of course based on the profits of\r\nthe preceding year; but in the collection of these taxes from mineral\r\noperations, it is recognized that mineral deposits are wasting assets,\r\nand therefore a considerable part of the income may under the law be\r\nregarded as a distribution of capital assets, and be deducted from\r\ntaxable income. The amount to be deducted obviously depends on the size\r\nof the reserves and the life,--with the result that progressive\r\nadjustment of income tax valuations tends to take into consideration\r\nexactly the same factors as are used in the _ad valorem_ method. It is\r\nobviously unjust, for instance, to collect the same proportion of tax\r\nfrom the annual income of a mine which has a life of only two years as\r\nfrom a mine which has a life of fifty years. Under the federal income\r\ntax a capital value is placed on the mineral deposit as of March 1,\r\n1913, which total capital value may be increased with subsequent\r\ndiscoveries. As the ore is taken out of the ground and sold, income tax\r\nis paid only on the difference between the assigned capital value per\r\nunit and the selling profit. If, for instance, the capital value as of\r\nMarch 1, 1913, is placed at 50c. per ton of mineral in the ground, and\r\nten years later a ton is sold for a profit of $1, income tax is paid on\r\n50c. The figure of 50c. per ton as value in the ground is actually\r\nobtained by estimating a profit, when the ore is ultimately mined and\r\nsold, of $1 per ton, and discounting this dollar to present worth as of\r\nMarch 1, 1913. Therefore the total amounts on which taxes are paid\r\nduring the life of the mine should represent approximately the total\r\naccruals of interest from March 1, 1913. In this manner the proportion\r\nof annual income to be taxed becomes larger with the length of the life\r\nperiod. With a deposit having a life of thirty years the net result is\r\nthat about half of the aggregate income is taxed, though this figure of\r\ncourse varies somewhat with the interest rate used.\r\n\r\nIn the collection of income taxes from coal mines in England, and in the\r\ncollection of certain state income taxes in the United States, a\r\nconsiderably smaller allowance is made for the retirement of capital\r\nvalue (or for _depletion_, as this is commonly called). In these cases\r\nthe deduction allowed is a small fixed percentage of the capital value,\r\nregardless of the actual life of the property.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of mineral resources as wasting assets in the United\r\nStates income tax law meets one considerable practical difficulty--namely,\r\nthat the law really requires physical or _ad valorem_ valuation of\r\nevery mineral property by the government, as a check on the claims for\r\ndepletion allowance. This immense and expensive task is too much for the\r\ntax collection agencies as now organized, and it may be questionable\r\nwhether it will ever be desirable to expand these agencies to the extent\r\nrequired for such a purpose. This is the principal argument for the use\r\nof arbitrary depletion factors such as those sometimes used abroad.\r\n\r\nThere are many advocates of the straight tonnage tax on mineral\r\ndeposits, on the ground that it is simple, definite, and easily applied.\r\nThe present tendency is to extend the application of this form of tax.\r\nIt is clear, however, that to assume the same value per ton for taxing\r\npurposes on a property making a large profit, and on another property\r\nwhich, because of physical conditions, is barely able to operate at a\r\nprofit, imposes a relative injustice. To meet this difficulty, it is\r\nsometimes proposed that the tonnage tax should be graded in such a\r\nmanner as to allow for differences in physical conditions and in profit\r\nat different mines. When one attempts to apply a graded tonnage tax,\r\nhowever, it soon becomes apparent that, in order to make such a\r\nvaluation equitable as between properties, it is necessary to use all\r\nof the factors of the _ad valorem_ method for each of the properties.\r\nThe wide appeal of arguments for a flat tonnage tax is based partly on\r\npopular misconception of the complexity of elements entering into\r\nmineral valuations.\r\n\r\nThere are many forms of more or less indirect tax which are substituted\r\nin different parts of the world for direct taxes. For instance, certain\r\nstates in South America do not tax ores in the ground, but collect the\r\nrevenue in the form of mining licenses or export taxes.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL COMMENTS ON TAXATION OF MINERAL RESOURCES\r\n\r\nThere has been a noticeable tendency in recent years to regard mineral\r\nresources as a heritage of the people, to be held in trust, rather than\r\nas property to be acquired and managed solely for private interest. This\r\ntendency has been indicated by the adoption in various parts of the\r\nworld of laws affecting rights to explore and acquire minerals on the\r\npublic domain; laws relating to the right of eminent domain over\r\nminerals already alienated from the government; laws regulating the\r\nexploitation of minerals in the interests of conservation; laws relating\r\nto tariffs and other restrictions on the export of mineral commodities;\r\nand laws relating to taxation.\r\n\r\nThe feeling that mineral resources really do not belong in private hands\r\nhas undoubtedly been an underlying factor in the imposition of heavy\r\ntaxes. Contributing to this action also are the popular belief in the\r\nintrinsic bonanza values in mineral resources, the failure to recognize\r\nthe large element of value which is put into such resources by human\r\nefforts, and the failure to realize that the social surplus in the\r\naggregate is small. To some tax officials an ore is an ore, more or less\r\nregardless of situation, of conditions of mining, of the demand for the\r\nproduct, and of the time when the demand will allow the ore to be\r\nmined,--in short, more or less regardless of what the ore may be made to\r\nyield as a going business. In this way heavy taxes are sometimes imposed\r\non mineral reserves, which are based on unwarrantably high appraisals of\r\nfuture possibilities, and which cannot be paid out of earnings.\r\n\r\nUltimately, a tax must be adjusted to the capacity of the mine to pay\r\nout of its earnings, and this capacity in turn is determined both by the\r\nphysical characters of the ore and by the success with which it may be\r\nmade available for consumption. This view of valuation for taxing\r\npurposes is sometimes opposed by mining men on the grounds that it taxes\r\nbrains, skill, and initiative, and that it puts a premium on shiftless\r\nmanagement. The same argument might be applied to the valuing of any\r\nbusiness or profession. To the writer the argument is not sound, in that\r\nit fails to recognize the element of human energy in resource values. If\r\nvalue were to be confined solely to the intrinsic character of the ore\r\nitself, there would be required an almost impossible degree of\r\ndiscrimination on the part of taxing officials to dissociate this value\r\nfrom other considerations; and there would be required further the\r\ndifferentiation between efficient and inefficient management, which\r\ninvolves so many considerations that the conclusion would be worthless.\r\n\r\nIn the application of income taxes to mining operations, there is\r\nsometimes another tendency toward over-taxation in that the income is\r\nregarded as more or less permanent, and insufficient allowance is made\r\nfor exhaustion of the mineral deposit. Under the United States income\r\ntax, mineral deposits are definitely recognized as wasting assets and\r\nthis factor is allowed for; but in state income taxes and in England and\r\nother parts of the world, allowances for this purpose are small.\r\n\r\nThere is wide belief that heavy taxation of mineral resources,\r\nparticularly on the _ad valorem_ basis, retards exploration and prevents\r\nthe development of the reserves which are necessary to stabilize the\r\nmineral industry. High taxes have undoubtedly had this effect in some\r\ncases, especially where taxes have been imposed on resources long prior\r\nto development; but, in the writer's view, this tendency in general has\r\nnot yet passed the danger point, and is not likely to do so until taxes\r\nbecome positively confiscatory of the industry. To argue that increase\r\nof taxes may even have certain beneficial results on the mineral\r\nindustry may lead to suspicion of one's mental soundness; but it is hard\r\nto escape the conclusion that the incidence of high taxes has led to a\r\nmuch more careful study of the question of reserves, has eliminated in\r\nsome cases the expenditure of money for development of excessive\r\nreserves to be used far in the future, and has tended to prevent\r\nover-production.\r\n\r\nWhere mineral reserves are developed too far ahead of demand, the\r\ninterest on the investment piles up an economic loss to be charged\r\nagainst the industry. It may be assumed that the urge for exploration\r\nwill continue as long as there is demand for mineral resources; and\r\nthat, to keep the industry on a sound basis, a certain amount should be\r\nset aside and charged to cost for the purpose of keeping up reserves in\r\na proper ratio to production. Much remains to be learned about the most\r\ndesirable ratio between reserves and production. In many camps, before\r\nthe incidence of high taxes, this ratio was not properly determined; and\r\nthere was a tendency, due to natural acquisitiveness and in the absence\r\nof anything to hinder it, to build up reserves indefinitely. The first\r\neffect of high taxes in such camps has frequently been the curtailment\r\nof exploration and development. Later, as production has begun to\r\napproach the end of the reserves, exploration has been resumed, but only\r\non a scale necessary to insure production for a limited period in\r\nadvance.\r\n\r\nThe argument that high taxes inhibit exploration is good only beyond the\r\npoint where the industry itself becomes no longer profitable. If there\r\nis sufficient demand for the resource, it is obvious that such a\r\ncondition cannot long continue; for, as production and the development\r\nof reserves fall off, the resulting increase in the price received for\r\nthe product is likely to offset any effect of taxes, and to restimulate\r\nproduction and exploration.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, in this period of high taxes following the war, there is\r\nmuch discouragement in the matter of exploration, suggesting that the\r\ndanger point is being approached. Some relief has been afforded by\r\nrecent special provisions of the federal income tax law, recognizing\r\nmineral resources as wasting assets, allowing recent discoveries to be\r\nincluded with total assets for depletion purposes, and recognizing\r\nspecial and peculiar circumstances with reference to each mine. Also a\r\ncertain amount of exploration goes on through the momentum gained from\r\npast conditions, without sufficiently full recognition of the effect of\r\npresent high taxes. This is not surprising when it is remembered that\r\nthe people actively engaged in field exploration often do not think\r\nsufficiently fully of the tax situation, until after a discovery or\r\ndevelopment has brought them face to face with it.\r\n\r\nBecause of the vital importance of the reserve factor in mineral\r\nvaluation, geologic aid and advice are extensively sought by both public\r\nand private organizations. Mining geologists are playing an important\r\npart in the application of the national income tax. A larger number are\r\nacting for private companies in appraisals required by this tax. Many\r\ngeologists are used in making valuations for state taxes, and in two\r\ncases the state geological surveys have complete charge of appraisals.\r\nThese appraisals include not only examinations of specific properties,\r\nbut general surveys of large regions, to ascertain possible values of\r\nundeveloped lands and to establish broad principles of valuation based\r\non a consideration of all the physical factors in the situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nLAWS RELATING TO MINERAL RESOURCES\r\n\r\n\r\nThis heading is likely to suggest mining law and the vast literature\r\ndevoted to it. Mining law has mainly to do with questions of the\r\nownership and leasing of mineral deposits. In addition, there are laws\r\nrelating to the extraction of mineral products, including those having\r\nto do with methods of mining and with safety and welfare measures. There\r\nare laws affecting the distribution of mineral products, such as those\r\nrelating to tariffs, duties, international trade agreements, and many\r\nother matters. There are laws relating to underground water, to shore\r\nlines, and to various geologic engineering fields.\r\n\r\nIn the formulation of these laws, as well as in the litigation growing\r\nout of their infraction, basic geologic principles are involved; and\r\nthus it is that the geologist finds much practice in the application of\r\nhis science to legal questions. It will be convenient to consider some\r\nof the laws relating to mineral resources under three headings: first,\r\nownership and control; second, extraction; and third, distribution.\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nLAWS RELATING TO OWNERSHIP AND CONTROL OF MINERAL RESOURCES\r\n\r\nLarge use of mineral resources is of comparatively recent date. Some of\r\nthe mineral industries are not more than a decade or two old and the\r\ngreater number of them are scarcely a century old. In the United States\r\nthe mineral industry dates mainly from the gold rush to California in\r\n1849. The formulation of laws relating to the ownership of minerals has\r\non the whole followed rather than preceded the development of the\r\nmineral industries; and hence mining laws relating to ownership are not\r\nof great age, although historical precedent may be traced far back.\r\n\r\n\r\nON ALIENATED LANDS\r\n\r\nWhere lands came into private ownership, or were \"alienated\" from the\r\ngovernments before the formulation of mining laws, varied procedures\r\nhave been followed in different countries.\r\n\r\nIn England and the United States, under the old regime in Russia, and to\r\na slight extent in other parts of the world, mineral titles remain with\r\nthe owner of the land and the government does not exercise the right of\r\neminent domain. But even in England, where private property rights have\r\nbeen held peculiarly sacred, the discovery of oil during the later years\r\nof the war led to an attempt to expropriate the oil rights for the\r\ngovernment. Because of the objection of landowners this attempt has not\r\nreached the statute books, but the movement is today an extremely live\r\npolitical question in England. A somewhat similar question is involved\r\nalso in the movement to nationalize the coal resources of England, now\r\nbeing so vigorously urged by the labor party. In the United States, no\r\nserious attempt has yet been made to take over mineral resources from\r\nprivate ownership.\r\n\r\nOther countries have gone farther in retroactive measures in regard to\r\nalienated lands. Under the leadership of France, most of the countries\r\nof western Europe have appropriated to their governments the\r\nundiscovered mineral resources on private ground, particularly those\r\nbeneath the surface, except where previously they had been specifically\r\nconveyed to the private owners, or with the exception of certain\r\ndesignated areas and minerals which had been conveyed to private\r\nownership prior to certain dates. Some minerals occurring at the\r\nsurface, variously specified and defined in different countries, are\r\nallowed to remain with the private owners, although often subject to\r\ngovernment regulation in regard to their development and use.\r\n\r\nIn varying degree this treatment of mineral resources on alienated lands\r\nis followed in the British colonial laws--in South Africa, Australia,\r\nNew Zealand, and Canada--and in the Latin-American laws. The laws are\r\nusually based on specified classifications of minerals. Those occurring\r\nat or near the surface, and called \"quarries,\" \"placer deposits,\"\r\n\"non-mines,\" or \"surface deposits,\" usually remain with the surface\r\nowners. Those beneath the surface, called \"sub-surface deposits\" or\r\n\"mines,\" in general belong to the government. In some of the countries\r\nof South America the state exercises eminent domain even over the\r\nsurface deposits; and in others even sub-surface minerals remain in\r\nprivate ownership, where specifically granted, or where the transfer of\r\nproperty took place prior to certain dates.\r\n\r\nWhere the government has acquired mineral ownership of lands previously\r\nalienated, the resources are open for development either by the owners\r\nof the surface or by others, on a rental, lease, specific tax, labor, or\r\nconcession basis. The government holds the title, exacts tribute, and\r\nmore or less directs and controls the operation. Exceptionally, as in\r\nOntario, British Columbia, Quebec, and Newfoundland, the government\r\ngrants patents, that is, it disposes of its rights to purchasers.\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE PUBLIC DOMAIN\r\n\r\nWhere the development of mineral resources began before the lands had\r\npassed from governmental ownership, special mining laws were enacted.\r\nLooked at broadly, these laws may be regarded as based on two partly\r\nconflicting considerations.\r\n\r\n(1) The assumption that mineral resources, which are wasting assets,\r\naccumulated through long geologic periods, are peculiarly public\r\nproperty,--not to be allowed to go into private ownership, but to be\r\ntreated as a heritage for the people as a whole and to be transferred to\r\nposterity in the best possible condition. Some of the early minerals to\r\nbe developed were used either for money or for war purposes, leading\r\nnaturally to the acceptance of the idea that these belonged to the\r\ngovernment or to the sovereign.\r\n\r\n(2) The assumption that the discovery and development of mineral\r\nresources requires a free field for individual initiative, and that the\r\nfewest possible obstacles are to be put in the way of private ownership.\r\nGovernments have not as a rule been greatly interested nor particularly\r\nsuccessful in exploration. Therefore, in framing laws of ownership,\r\nconcessions have been made to encourage private initiative in\r\nexploration and development. In the case of the United States this idea\r\nwas coupled with the broad doctrine that the government held public\r\nlands only in the interest of the people, and that its people were\r\nentitled to secure these lands for private ownership with the least\r\npossible restriction.\r\n\r\nA survey of the mining laws affecting the public domain or\r\nnon-alienated lands of different parts of the world, as well as the\r\nhistory of changes in the mining laws, indicates a wide range of\r\nrelative emphasis on these two underlying considerations. In the United\r\nStates, at one extreme, the laws have been such as to give the maximum\r\npossible freedom to private initiative, and to allow easy acquirement of\r\nmineral resources from the government. At the other extreme, in South\r\nAfrica, Australia, and South America, it is impossible for the\r\nindividual to secure title in fee simple from the government; he must\r\ndevelop the mineral resources on what amounts to a lease or rental\r\nbasis, the ownership remaining in the government.\r\n\r\nThe trend of events in mineral laws is toward the latter procedure. This\r\nis evidenced in the United States by the withdrawal of large areas of\r\npublic lands from entry, and by the recent enactment substituting\r\nleasing privileges for specified minerals for the outright ownership\r\nwhich was allowed under the federal law before the lands were withdrawn\r\nfrom entry. The withdrawal of oil lands from public entry in other parts\r\nof the world is another illustration (see pp. 131-132).\r\n\r\n\r\nNATIONALIZATION OF MINERAL RESOURCES\r\n\r\nNationalization, as this term is popularly understood, means financial\r\ncontrol and management of mineral resources by the government, either\r\nthrough actual ownership or through measures of public control designed\r\nto eliminate private interest from the active direction of the\r\nresources. In a broader sense, it may be used to include a considerable\r\nvariety of restrictive and coercive measures adopted by the government\r\nin the proposed interests of public welfare,--as illustrated by the\r\nwar-time measures instituted by the United States and other governments\r\nrelating to the mining and distribution of coal, and to coal prices. In\r\nthis broader sense various aspects of nationalization are indicated\r\nunder other headings in this and other chapters.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that other countries of the world have gone farther in the\r\ndirection of nationalization of mineral resources than the United\r\nStates. The tendency was manifest before the war, and has been strongly\r\nemphasized during and since the war. In the United States,\r\nnotwithstanding war-time measures, the subject has not yet come\r\nprominently forward, at least by name. On the other hand, there has been\r\ngrowing recognition of the dependence of public welfare on the proper\r\nhandling of mineral resources--particularly of the energy resources,\r\ncoal and oil,--as evidenced by a variety of proposals and measures under\r\nconsideration in legislative and administrative branches of our national\r\nand state governments. Even taxation, both local and national, has in\r\neffect reached a stage where private interest has become considerably\r\nminimized by the increasing burdens laid on the industry by government\r\nrequirements. The immediate purpose of taxation is to raise money for\r\nthe needs of the government; but in the formulation of tax measures\r\nthere is clearly to be discerned a growth of underlying sentiment that\r\nnatural resources belong in some fashion to the public, and that private\r\ncontrol is to be regarded not as a sacred property right but as a trust\r\nheld on sufferance of the public.\r\n\r\nIn view of the obvious trend toward nationalization in other parts of\r\nthe world and the significant tendencies in the United States, it seems\r\nlikely that the subject of nationalization of mineral resources will\r\ncome prominently to the front in this country in the comparatively near\r\nfuture. If so, it is time that students of mineral resources should\r\nrecognize the comprehensiveness of this problem, and should attempt to\r\ndevelop basic principles to serve as a guide in the direction and\r\nformulation of the numerous and complex measures which are sure to be\r\nproposed. At present there is no government or technical organization\r\nrelated to the industry which is studying the problem in its broader\r\naspects and is in a position to advise wisely with public officials\r\ninterested in this problem.\r\n\r\nIt is beyond the scope of this book to discuss the pro and con of an\r\neconomic question of this magnitude. The writer would, however, record\r\nhis belief, which is implied also in discussions in other chapters, that\r\nthe discovery and intelligent management of mineral resources by their\r\nvery nature and infinite variety require private initiative, and that\r\nthe history of government efforts in this field in this and other\r\ncountries does not promise that nationalization can supply sufficient\r\nadvantages to counterbalance the loss of this element. With this view\r\nthe problem of nationalization becomes one of determining what steps, if\r\nany, can be taken by a government to the advantage of public welfare,\r\nwhich will at the same time preserve and foster private initiative,\r\nexercised with the hope of reward, which seems alone to be capable of\r\nmeeting the variable, elastic, and complex problems inherent in the\r\ndevelopment of a natural resource.\r\n\r\nA first step toward a broad scientific attack on this problem would be\r\nthe recognition of the fact that tariffs, taxes, conservation,\r\ninternational mineral questions, leasing laws, and various technical\r\ninvestigations of minerals are but parts of a great unit problem. With\r\nthis recognition there should follow naturally an attempt to correlate\r\nand direct the many government agencies, legislative and administrative,\r\nnow concerned with different aspects of the problem. Under present\r\nconditions, the various elements of the problem are considered by\r\ndifferent groups of persons, without sufficient contacts or correlation\r\nto promise the development of a broad, underlying policy.\r\n\r\n\r\nEFFECT OF OWNERSHIP LAWS ON EXPLORATION\r\n\r\nThe nature and the progress of exploration (and development) in\r\ndifferent countries have been more or less related to the character of\r\nthe mining laws.\r\n\r\nWhere the mineral resource has passed from government control into\r\nprivate ownership, exploration is a matter of commercial arrangement\r\nbetween the explorer and the owner. There is often some lag in\r\nexploration, especially where the lands are held in considerable blocks.\r\nThe owner is often not inclined, or unable, to institute effective\r\nexploration himself; and even though he is willing to offer favorable\r\nexploration terms to others, the inducement is often less attractive\r\nthan on government lands. For instance, it is stated that in England,\r\ndue to the many requirements of law and custom, it takes on an average\r\neight years, and in some cases even longer, to close a coal lease after\r\nthe terms have been agreed upon. The slowness of exploration and\r\ndevelopment on the great land grants in the United States, and on the\r\ntracts of the large timber companies, also illustrates the retarding\r\neffect of private ownership. It is partly this situation that is making\r\ngovernments increasingly careful about parting with mineral ownership,\r\nand that is leading to the introduction of more or less coercive\r\nmeasures, either to regain control or to make it easier for the public\r\nto explore and develop minerals on privately owned lands. Under the\r\ngreat land grants to railroads in the United States it is becoming\r\nincreasingly difficult to secure mineral patents from the government;\r\nand there has been litigation between government and grantees, as in the\r\ncase of certain oil lands of the Southern Pacific Railway. The taxation\r\nin some states of mineral rights which have been reserved by large\r\nowners is indirectly resulting in appraisal of these rights by the\r\nowners and in efforts to utilize them. As long as mineral rights were\r\nnot taxed independently of surface rights, they were often reserved in\r\nselling surface rights on the mere chance that mineral might be found in\r\nthe future, and thereby general exploration and development were held\r\nback.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, minerals on the public domain have been open to\r\nexploration and acquirement with minimum restrictions, except for the\r\nconsiderable areas later withdrawn from entry. After long delay a part\r\nof these withdrawn lands are again open to private exploration, but not\r\nto fee ownership. Specified minerals--coal, oil, phosphates, and\r\npotash--may be explored for, and may be leased under certain\r\nrestrictions as to amount and time of development. The effect of this\r\nact on exploration is yet to be proved; but since many of the lands have\r\nnow been shown to be favorable for minerals which are in great demand,\r\nthere is little doubt that exploration will be resumed on a large scale.\r\nOn the whole, under the federal mining laws of the United States the\r\nindividual prospector has maximum leeway,--and from the standpoint of\r\ndevelopment of resources this procedure probably has been justified.\r\n\r\nIn other countries where the mineral resources are owned by the\r\ngovernment, there is in most cases considerable restriction, through\r\nlicenses and other regulative measures, upon the activities of\r\nprospectors. This restriction, together with the fact that it is usually\r\nnot possible to secure title to the land, but only to secure rights\r\nthrough rental or leasing, is to some extent a deterring influence on\r\nthe penniless prospector. It does not follow that under these conditions\r\nexploration and development are absent. The charges imposed are light,\r\nand in the early stages require comparatively small contributions as\r\nevidence of good faith. It is to be remembered that exploration has\r\nbecome concentrated more and more into the hands of persons financially\r\nable to meet such conditions. Exploration is passing from the highly\r\nhazardous stage of individual effort into a systematic business with\r\ncalculable returns.\r\n\r\n\r\nUSE OF GEOLOGY IN RELATION TO OWNERSHIP LAWS\r\n\r\nThe contacts between geology and laws relating to mineral ownership are\r\nmany and varied; a few illustrative examples are offered.\r\n\r\nMany difficulties arise from the loose use of mineral names in these\r\nlaws. The laws governing location of mineral deposits in Cuba are so\r\nframed that iron ores may be located and claimed from the government\r\neither as \"iron ores\" or as \"bog ores and yellow ochers.\" Some of the\r\nimportant ores of eastern Cuba, now being extensively used in the United\r\nStates, came into litigation because rival claimants had overlapping\r\nclaims under the two classifications. The wording of the law is of\r\ncourse ambiguous, and suggests that geologists did not have a hand in\r\nits framing. To establish title to these claims it was necessary to show\r\nwhether these ores had been rightfully located as iron ores, or whether\r\nthey should have been located as bog ores and yellow ochers. This\r\ninvolved an analysis of the geological conditions, to show that the ores\r\nare the result of normal weathering and concentration in place of the\r\nunderlying rocks--an origin common to many iron ore deposits,--and that\r\nthey do not have the characteristic origin of bog ores. In short, the\r\nquestion was settled on the scientific principles of origin of ores and\r\nof metamorphic geology.\r\n\r\nThe efforts of our federal government to frame and apply mining laws to\r\npublic lands have involved extensive geological and mining surveys by\r\nthe United States Geological Survey and the Bureau of Mines. The land\r\nclassification work for this purpose by the Geological Survey has been\r\nof wide scope. The recently enacted leasing law, which opens up\r\ngovernment lands for exploration of coal, oil, potash, and phosphate,\r\nrequires carefully prepared geologic data for its proper administration.\r\n\r\nState governments also have initiated surveys of an exploring nature for\r\ntaxing and other public purposes (see pp. 306, 311).\r\n\r\nIn the United States there is a wide use of geologists as witnesses in\r\nlitigation affecting \"extralateral rights.\" The federal mining law gives\r\nthe owner of the claim containing the \"apex\" or top of a mineral vein\r\nor lode the right to follow the vein down the dip, with certain\r\nlimitations, even though this takes him on to adjacent properties under\r\nother ownership. Where two branches of a vein are followed down from\r\nseparate claims, the owner of the oldest claim is entitled to the vein\r\nbelow the point of junction. The law was framed to validate a procedure\r\nmore or less established by mining custom. It was obviously framed with\r\na very simple and precise conception in mind--namely, a simple vein\r\ndefinitely and easily followed, without much interruption or contortion.\r\n\r\nIn nature, however, veins or lodes have a most astonishing variety of\r\nform and occurrence, making it difficult to frame a definition that is\r\ncomprehensive and at the same time sufficiently precise for all cases. A\r\ncommonly used definition of a vein or lode is a mineralized mass of rock\r\nwhich is followed for purposes of finding ore. The mineral matter may be\r\ncontinuous or discontinuous. There may be one definite wall, or two\r\nwalls, or none at all. There may be associated gouges and altered or\r\nmineralized rock. The vein may consist of almost any combination of the\r\nelements of mineral matter, walls, gouges, and mineralized rock. Instead\r\nof being a simple tabular sheet, a vein may have almost any conceivable\r\nshape; it may consist of multiple strands of most complex relations; it\r\nmay have branches and cross-over connections. It may be a more or less\r\nmineralized sedimentary formation with limits determined by original\r\ndeposition. It is very often bent or folded, and even more often\r\nfaulted; the faulting may be of great complexity, making it extremely\r\ndifficult to follow the vein. The vein may be cut by other veins of\r\ndifferent ages, which in places may be hard to distinguish one from\r\nanother. Erosion working down on a complex vein displaced by faulting\r\nand folding may bring several parts of the same vein to the surface,\r\ndeveloping what seem to be separate vein apices. Where there are many\r\nveins close together, it may be difficult to determine whether the\r\nentire mass should be considered a unit vein or lode (a \"broad lode\"),\r\nor whether each vein should be considered independently under the law.\r\n\r\nThe geologic aspects of these problems are obvious. There are few mining\r\ndistricts where the vein conditions are so simple that no geological\r\nproblems are left to be solved with relation to extralateral rights. In\r\nthe early stages of the mining, separate operations may be carried on\r\nfor a considerable time in a district without mutual interference; but\r\nas mining is carried down the dip, what seemed to be separate veins may\r\nbe found to be parts of the same vein or parts of a complex vein system,\r\nand separate mining organizations are thus brought into conflict. It\r\nthen becomes necessary either to consolidate the ownerships or to go to\r\nthe courts to see which claim has the extralateral rights. In either\r\ncase, the geologist is called on to play a large part,--in the valuation\r\nof rights for the purpose of combination, or in litigation to settle\r\napex rights. A geologic survey of the conditions is a prerequisite. In\r\norder to get the needed information for the courtroom, it may be\r\nnecessary to go further, and to conduct extensive underground\r\nexploration under geologic direction. Some of the most intensive and\r\ncomplete geological surveys of mineral resources in existence have been\r\ndone for litigation purposes. The study in these cases is not empirical,\r\nbut goes into every conceivable scientific aspect of the situation which\r\nmay throw any light on the underground conditions--the source of the\r\nores, the nature and source of the solutions which deposited them, their\r\npaths of travel, the structural and metamorphic conditions, the\r\nmineralogical and chemical character of the ores and rocks, and even\r\nbroader questions of geologic age. The many volumes of testimony which\r\nhave accumulated during famous apex trials cover almost every phase of\r\ngeology, and are important primary sources for the student of economic\r\ngeology.\r\n\r\nIt is often argued that strictly scientific, impartial geologic work is\r\nimpossible in connection with one of these trials, because the viewpoint\r\nis warped by the desire to win. The sharp contrast in the views of\r\nexperts on the two sides is cited in evidence.\r\n\r\nThere is no denying the fact that the conditions of a trial tend toward\r\na certain warp in scientific perspective. On the other hand, the very\r\nexistence of competitive and opposing interests leads to the most\r\nintensive detailed study, and to complete disclosure of the facts. In\r\nmost cases there are no substantial differences in the statements of\r\nscientific fact by reputable experts on the two sides, although there\r\nmay be wide differences in the inferences drawn from these facts. The\r\nfailure to note a fact, or any distortion or misstatement of a fact, is\r\nfollowed so quickly by correction or criticism from the other side, that\r\nthe professional witness usually takes the utmost pains to make his\r\nstatement of fact scientific and precise as far as his ability goes. Few\r\nscientific treatises in geology contain any more accurate accounts of\r\nmineral deposits than testimony in cases of this sort. If every student\r\nof geology, early in his career, could have a day on the witness stand\r\non a geologic problem, under both direct and cross examination, he would\r\nlearn once and for all the necessity for close and accurate thinking,\r\nthe difference between a fact and an inference, and the difference\r\nbetween inductive study of facts and the subjective approach to a\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\nIt is a common assumption that a witness called to testify on scientific\r\nmatters is on a somewhat different basis from the eye-witness to an\r\nevent or transaction. We are not sure that this assumption is justified.\r\nSeldom is it possible in mining operations to disclose the facts in\r\nthree dimensions so completely that they may be empirically observed and\r\nplatted by the layman. The grouping and presentation of the facts in\r\nadequate perspective require an analysis of the origin of the ores and\r\nrocks, the rock alterations, the structural systems, and other facts. No\r\none ever saw the vein or lode in the process of formation. The true\r\nnature of the event and of its physical results must be inferred\r\ninductively from circumstantial evidence. If it be conceded that it is\r\nnecessary and right to call an eye-witness to an event involved in\r\nlitigation, it is equally necessary where there are no eye-witnesses to\r\ncall the persons best qualified to interpret the circumstantial\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\nIt is to be remembered that apex cases are only one kind of a vast\r\nvariety of cases affecting mineral resources. At one time or another,\r\nand in some connection or another, practically every geologist of\r\nconsiderable experience has found it necessary to testify on geologic\r\nmatters in court. The wide interest attaching to certain spectacular\r\napex cases has led in some quarters to hasty criticism of the\r\nparticipation of geologists therein, without apparent recognition of the\r\nfact that the criticism applies in principle to many other kinds of\r\nlitigation and to practically all economic geologists. This criticism\r\nalso fails to take cognizance of the fact that, for every case tried,\r\nthere are many settled out of court through the advice and cooperation\r\nof geologists. While there may be in the geologic profession, as in\r\nothers, a very few men whose testimony can be bought outright, in\r\ngeneral it must be assumed that geologists will appear on the witness\r\nstand only when, after careful examination, they are satisfied that\r\nthere is a legitimate point of view to be presented.\r\n\r\nGeologists and engineers understand more clearly than almost any other\r\ngroup the extent to which the complexities of nature vary from the\r\nconditions indicated in the simple wording of the law of extralateral\r\nrights. Almost to a man, they favor either modification or repeal of the\r\nlaw. On the other hand, the law has been in force since 1872, it has\r\nbeen repeatedly interpreted and confirmed by the courts, and a vast body\r\nof property rights has been established under it. Lawyers see great\r\nlegal difficulties in the way of its repeal or serious modification.\r\nMining men for the most part are not primarily interested one way or\r\nanother, unless there is potential application of the extralateral-rights\r\nprovision to their particular properties. Of those who are thus interested,\r\nsome hope to gain and some fear they may lose in the application of the\r\nlaw. The general public naturally has little direct interest in the\r\nproblem. There is thus no effective public sentiment favoring the repeal\r\nor modification of the law. It seems likely that for some time to come the\r\nlaw, in spite of its recognized defects, must be applied, and the best\r\ngeological effort must be directed toward reaching interpretations which\r\ncome most near to meeting its intent. To refuse to lend geologic science\r\nto the aid of justice because the law was improperly framed is hardly a\r\ndefensible position. Presumably it will never be possible to frame laws\r\nwith such full knowledge of nature's facts as to eliminate the necessity\r\nfor scientific advice in their interpretation.\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested that the courts, and not the litigants, should\r\nemploy the geologists. The practical objection to this proposition lies\r\nin the difficulty encountered by the judge in the proper selection of\r\ngeologists. On the assumption that the judge would select only men in\r\nwhom he had confidence, it is not likely that he would override their\r\nconclusions. The outcome of the case, therefore, would be largely\r\npredetermined at the moment the selection of experts was made. It is to\r\nbe doubted whether courts can have the knowledge of the scientific field\r\nand of the requirements of the situation necessary to make the wisest\r\nselection of men to interpret the given condition. The competitive\r\nelement would be eliminated. From a judicial standpoint, there seems to\r\nbe an equally good chance of getting at the best interpretation of the\r\nfacts by listening to presentations from different standpoints, with the\r\naccompanying interplay of criticism and questioning.\r\n\r\nAnother practical objection to appointment of experts by the court is\r\nthe limitation of court costs, which would make it impossible to secure\r\nthe highest grade men. So far as these men are public employees, such as\r\nmembers of the federal or state geological surveys, this might be\r\narranged. For others, it might be suggested that they should be willing\r\nto sacrifice their energy and time in the interests of justice; but as\r\nlong as human nature and conditions are what they are, it is perhaps\r\nfutile to argue this question.\r\n\r\nIf it is right to apply science to practical affairs, in other words, if\r\nthe profession of economic geology is a legitimate one, it seems\r\ninevitable that the application must be in some part directed by the\r\ngeologist himself, in order to avoid mistakes and confusion. The\r\ncontention that the scientist must isolate himself in a rarified\r\natmosphere to avoid contamination from a non-scientific, commercial, or\r\nlegal atmosphere, seems to the writer practically untenable, if we\r\nrecognize any obligation on the part of science to the practical conduct\r\nof human affairs. The fact that the geologist in making these\r\napplications may occasionally find himself in a non-scientific\r\natmosphere may be deplored from the standpoint of maximum creativeness\r\nin science, and from this standpoint there may be reason for limitation\r\nof time given to this kind of work,--but to stay out entirely on this\r\nground is to deny his obligation to make his science helpful to his\r\nfellows. The problem cannot be solved by staying out. It calls rather\r\nfor an especial effort on the part of the scientist to establish and\r\nmaintain his standards of science and ethics in the applied fields. Some\r\ndoubtless fail in this effort. Others are strengthened scientifically\r\nand ethically, and contribute important aid in raising general\r\nstandards. The principle of non-participation in such activities for\r\nfear of lowering scientific standards may make the geologist's problem\r\neasier, but at the expense of non-fulfillment of duties. Such a course\r\nhas for its logical consequence an abandonment of the application of his\r\nscience to untrained men without the ethical anchorage of scientific\r\nachievement. In short, there may be legitimate criticism of individual\r\ngeologists for their methods and ethics in the applied field, and this\r\nis desirable as an aid to maintaining and improving standards; but it\r\nis not a logical step from this to the conclusion that, to avoid\r\nunfortunate incidents, economic geologists must cloister themselves and\r\nthus deny the very implication of their title.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nLAWS RELATING TO EXTRACTION OF MINERAL RESOURCES\r\n\r\nUnder this heading come a wide variety of laws and\r\nregulations,--national, state, and local,--affecting the manner in which\r\nmineral resources shall be mined or quarried. Such laws may specify the\r\nnumber of shafts or outlets, the use of safety and prevention devices,\r\nminers' compensation and insurance, and many other features. Most of\r\nthese laws are framed for the purpose of conserving human life and\r\nenergy, but they directly affect the mining or extraction of the mineral\r\nresources themselves. Geology plays but little part in relation to such\r\nlaws.\r\n\r\nWhere the government retains ownership and leases or rents the\r\nresources, there are often provisions regarding the manner of mining and\r\nthe quality and quantity of the material to be mined, in the interests\r\nof efficient operation and conservation. The geologist is often called\r\ninto consultation both in framing and in dealing with the infraction of\r\nsuch provisions. It may be noted that the control thus exercised on the\r\noperator by government ownership is very much the same as that often\r\nexercised by the private fee owner. It is not unusual for fee owners of\r\nmineral rights to maintain a geological staff in order to follow\r\nintelligently underground developments, to see that the best methods of\r\nexploration and mining are followed, and that ores are either extracted\r\nor left in accordance with the best conservational practice.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nLAWS RELATING TO DISTRIBUTION AND TRANSPORTATION OF MINERAL RESOURCES\r\n\r\nUnder this heading come governmental regulations affecting directly or\r\nindirectly the transportation and the destination of mineral products.\r\nTransportation rates, tariffs, zoning, duties, and international trade\r\nagreements of all sorts have vital effects on distribution. In framing\r\nany of these measures for a mineral resource, it is desirable to know\r\nall about the character of the raw material, its physical occurrence and\r\ndistribution, and the possibilities for future development. In adjusting\r\nthe scientific naming and classification of mineral materials with the\r\ncrude names and classifications used commercially--as in tariffs, in\r\nimport and export laws, in reports of revenue collectors, in railway and\r\nship rates, etc.--the geologic information is likewise necessary.\r\n\r\nHeretofore, the formulation of measures concerning mineral distribution\r\nhas often not been done on a scientific and impartial basis; but in\r\nrecent years geologists have been called on more frequently for aid and\r\nadvice, as a means of checking or verifying the special pleadings of the\r\ndifferent industries. The rude disturbance of trade routes during the\r\nwar brought home the necessity of basing control of distribution of\r\nmineral products on fundamental facts of geology and geography; thus it\r\nwas that geologists had a considerable voice in the vast number of\r\nspecial measures taken for war purposes by such organizations as the\r\nShipping Board, the War Trade Board, the War Industries Board, and other\r\npublic organizations. The same was true in relation to the mineral\r\nresource questions at the Peace Conference. In the reconstructive\r\nmeasures of the future, a still larger use of scientific considerations\r\nmay be looked for. Further suggestions as to the relation of geology to\r\nlaws affecting distribution appear in the chapter on International\r\nAspects (Chapter XVIII).\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER RELATIONS OF GEOLOGY TO LAW\r\n\r\nIt is often assumed that the economic geologist is exclusively\r\ninterested in mineral resources. However, there are varied applications\r\nof geology outside of the mineral resource field,--to many kinds of\r\nengineering and construction operations, to soils, to water resources,\r\nand to transportation,--any of which may develop legal problems\r\nrequiring geologic service. A few illustrative cases follow.\r\n\r\nThe classification of mineral materials in contracts presents many\r\ndifficulties. A contract for a railway cut, for a canal, or for any\r\nother kind of excavation may specify different prices for removing\r\ndifferent mineral materials. Too often these are stated in extremely\r\ncrude and arbitrary terms, such as _rock_, _hard rock_, _hardpan_,\r\n_earth_, _dirt_, etc., without regard to the actual variety of materials\r\nto be dealt with. When, therefore, in the case of the Chicago drainage\r\ncanal, the contractor encountered a soft shale and claimed compensation\r\nfor rock excavation, geologists played a considerable part in the\r\nextensive litigation that followed in the attempt to define the facts of\r\nnature in terms of a contract which did not recognize them. In a railway\r\ncut through glacial drift or till, a contractor came suddenly upon a\r\nmass of till which had been so thoroughly cemented in place as to have\r\nall the resistance of rock. Litigation was then necessary to decide\r\nwhether this should be classified as dirt or rock.\r\n\r\nRock and dirt slides of all kinds, met with in open-pit mining, canals,\r\nand other excavations, present engineering problems with a geologic\r\nbasis. The kinds of rocks, their strength, porosity, and moisture\r\ncontent, the effects of weathering, and the structural conditions must\r\nbe determined in order to ascertain the cause of the slides, and are\r\nfeatures which figure largely in litigation arising from troubles of\r\nthis sort.\r\n\r\nBoth federal and state laws give the right to lateral and vertical\r\nsupport. When, therefore, adjacent or underlying excavations cause earth\r\nmovements in a neighbor's property, litigation is likely to ensue and\r\nthe geologist is likely to be called in. The long-wall method of coal\r\nmining, extensively practiced in certain parts of the United States, is\r\nslowly withdrawing support from the ground overlying the coal seams,\r\nresulting in damages to surface structures and in some cases to\r\noverlying mineral deposits. Extensive litigation has been the result,\r\nand the future seems to promise more of it. In certain metal-mining\r\ncamps, where considerable amounts of materials have been mined to great\r\ndepths, caves and cracking in the surface are reaching over unexpectedly\r\nwide areas, again threatening litigation.\r\n\r\nThe laws relating to the use of surface and underground waters touch the\r\ngeologic conditions in many ways. The permanent lowering or raising of a\r\nwater level through mining or damming may require a careful geological\r\nanalysis of the underground conditions affecting the movements of\r\nground-water. The use of streams for placer mining, as in California,\r\nhas resulted in formulation of laws and in extensive litigation, again\r\nrequiring analysis of geologic conditions.\r\n\r\nIn fact geologists, perhaps more than any other group, have come to\r\nrealize how many and how varied are the ways in which people get into\r\nconflict in using the earth on which they live.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nCONSERVATION OF MINERAL RESOURCES\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PROBLEM\r\n\r\nConservation of mineral resources may be defined as an effort to strike\r\na proper balance between the present and the future in the use of\r\nmineral raw materials.\r\n\r\nMineral resources have been used to some extent as far back as evidences\r\nof man go, but great drafts on our resources have come in comparatively\r\nrecent years. The use of many minerals has started within only a few\r\nyears, and for others the acceleration of production within the past two\r\nor three decades has been rapid (see pp. 63-64). In general, the use of\r\nmineral resources on a large scale may be said to have started within\r\nthe lifetime of men still active in business. The wide use of power\r\nnecessary to an industrial age, the development of metallurgy, the\r\nincreasing size and complexity of demands for raw material, mean that\r\nthe intensive development and use of our mineral resources is in its\r\ninfancy, and is in many respects in an experimental stage.\r\n\r\nAs nations have awakened to their need of mineral raw materials and to\r\nthe recent rapid depletion of these materials, they have been naturally\r\nled to inquire how long the reserves may last, and to consider\r\nprevention of waste and the more efficient use of materials, with a view\r\nto planning more prudently for future national supplies. The first\r\ninquiries seemed to reveal such shortage of mineral supplies as to call\r\nfor immediate and almost drastic steps to prevent waste, and possibly\r\neven to limit the use of certain minerals in the interests of posterity.\r\n\r\nMore careful study of the problem, as might be expected, revealed new\r\nfactors and greater complexity. The conservational idea has a wide\r\nsentimental appeal, but the formulation and application of specific\r\nplans meet many difficulties. In its practical aspects the problem is\r\nnow a live one, the solution of which is requiring the attention of\r\nmining men, engineers, geologists, economists, and public officials. It\r\nis a question which is coming more and more into the field of actual\r\nprofessional practice of the economic geologist.\r\n\r\nIt is our purpose to indicate the general nature of the conservation\r\nproblem. We may assume agreement to the desirability of preventing\r\nwaste, of making a wise present use of mineral products, and of striking\r\na proper balance between the present and future in their use. Nature has\r\ntaken many long geologic periods to build up these reserves. We, of the\r\npresent generation, in a sense hold them in trust; they are entailed to\r\nour successors. With this general thought in mind, how shall we proceed\r\nto formulate definite plans for conservation?\r\n\r\nAn initial step is obviously a careful taking of stock. With increasing\r\nknowledge of mineral resources, it is becoming apparent that early\r\nestimates of supplies were too low. Many of these estimates failed to\r\ntake into account mining to great depths, and wide use of low-grade\r\nores, rendered possible by improved methods; and especially they failed\r\nto put sufficient emphasis on the probabilities of new discoveries to\r\nreplace exhausted supplies. Early predictions have already been upset in\r\nregard to a number of mineral resources. The recognition of the general\r\nfact that the world is far from explored in two dimensions, to say\r\nnothing of three, of the fact that known geologic conditions do not yet\r\nindicate definite limits to the possibilities of exploration for most\r\nmineral resources, and of the consequent fact that for a long time in\r\nthe future, as in the past, discoveries of new mineral deposits will be\r\nroughly proportional to the effort and money spent in finding\r\nthem,--which means, also, proportional to the demand,--makes it\r\nimpossible, for most of the mineral resources, to set any definite\r\nlimits on reserves. It is comparatively easy to measure known reserves;\r\nbut a quantitative appraisal of the probable and possible reserves for\r\nthe future is extremely difficult. Successive revisions of estimates\r\nhave, with but few exceptions, progressively increased the total mineral\r\nsupplies available. The result is that the time of exhaustion has been\r\npushed far into the future for most of the important minerals, thus\r\nminimizing the urge for immediate and drastic conservational action,\r\nwhich followed naturally from early estimates of very limited supplies.\r\nFor both coal and iron, supplies are now known for hundreds or even\r\nthousands of years. For oil and lead, on the other hand, the reserves\r\nnow known have a life of comparatively few years, but the possibilities\r\nfor successful exploration make it probable that their life will be\r\ngreatly extended. Notwithstanding this tendency to lengthen the\r\nexhaustion period, the limits of mineral resource life are still small\r\nas compared with the life of the nation or of civilization,--and the\r\nfundamental desirability of conservation is not materially affected.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to predict the rate of production for the future. At the\r\npresent rate of coal production in the United States, the supplies to a\r\ndepth of 6,000 feet might last 6,000 years; but if it be assumed that\r\nthe recent _acceleration_ of production will be continued indefinitely\r\ninto the future, the result would be exhaustion of these supplies in\r\nless than 200 years. It is generally agreed that exhaustion will come\r\nsooner than 6,000 years, but will require more time than 200 years. The\r\nrange between these figures offers wide opportunity for guessing. It is\r\nsupposed that per capita consumption may not increase as fast in the\r\nfuture as in the past, that possibly an absorption point will be\r\nreached, and that there will be limits to transportation and\r\ndistribution; but how to evaluate these factors no one knows. In the\r\ncase of some of the metallic resources, such as iron, the fact that the\r\nworld's stock on hand is constantly increasing--losses due to rusting,\r\nship-wrecks, etc., being only a small fraction of the annual\r\noutput--suggests that a point will be reached where new production will\r\ncease to accelerate at the present rate and may even decline. But again,\r\nthe factors are so complex and many of them so little known, that no one\r\ncan say how soon this point will be reached.\r\n\r\nFor the immediate future, there is little to be feared from shortage of\r\nmineral supplies in the ground. The difficulties are more likely to\r\narise from the failure of means to extract and distribute these supplies\r\nfast enough to keep up with the startling acceleration in future demand\r\nindicated by the figures of recent years. The speed and magnitude of\r\nrecent material developments in many lines cannot but raise question as\r\nto whether we have the ability to understand and coodinate the many\r\nhuge, variable, and accelerating factors we have to deal with, or\r\nwhether some of the lines of development may not get so far ahead of\r\nothers as to cause serious disturbance of the whole material structure\r\nof civilization. Coal alone, which now constitutes a third of our\r\nrailway tonnage, may with increased rate of production require\r\ntwo-thirds of present railway capacity. Will railway development keep\r\nup? It may be noted that national crises and failures in the past\r\nhistory of the world have seldom, if ever, been due to shortage of raw\r\nmaterials, or in fact to any failure of the material environment.\r\n\r\nIn its early stages the conservation movement in this country concerned\r\nitself principally with the raw material. Later there came the\r\nrecognition of the fact that conservation of raw materials is closely\r\nbound up with the question of conservation of human energy. The two\r\nelements in the problem are much like the two major elements in mineral\r\nresource valuation (see pages 329-330). If in saving a dollar's worth of\r\nraw material, we spend two dollars worth of energy, it naturally raises\r\nquestion as to the wisdom of our procedure. It might be wiser in some\r\ncases to waste a certain amount of raw material because of the saving of\r\ntime and effort. It might be better for posterity to have the product of\r\nour energy multiplied into raw material than to have the raw material\r\nitself. The valuation of these two major elements of conservation is\r\nagain almost impossible of quantitative solution. We do not know what is\r\nthe best result to be aimed for. We cannot foresee the requirements of\r\nthe future nor the end toward which civilization is moving--or should\r\nmove. The extravagance of the United States is often contrasted\r\nunfavorably with the thriftiness of Europe. When considered in relation\r\nto raw materials alone, there seems to be basis for this charge. When\r\nconsidered in relation to the product of human energy into raw\r\nmaterials, the conclusion may be far different; for the output per man\r\nin the industries related to mineral resources is far greater in the\r\nUnited States than in Europe. In the case of iron, it has been estimated\r\nthat the output per man in the United States is two and one-half times\r\nas great as in the rest of the world. Which is best in the true\r\ninterests of conservation, we are not yet able to see.\r\n\r\nOur view of what is desirable in the way of conservation depends\r\nsomewhat on the limitations imposed by self-interest or location. By\r\ndevoting ourselves exclusively to one mineral resource, we might work\r\nout a conservation program very disadvantageous to the best use of some\r\nother mineral commodity. We might take steps to conserve chromite in the\r\nUnited States which would have a disastrous effect on the iron and\r\nsteel industry. We might conserve coal by the substitution of oil, when\r\nthe procedure is hardly warranted by the supplies of oil available. We\r\nmight work out a program for the United States which would not be the\r\nbest conservational plan for the world as a whole, and which would\r\nultimately react to the disadvantage of the United States. The wisest\r\nand most intelligent use of mineral resources seems to call\r\nunquestionably for their consideration in their world relations, rather\r\nthan for a narrow interpretation of local requirements.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIFFERENCES BETWEEN PRIVATE AND PUBLIC EFFORTS IN CONSERVATION\r\n\r\nIt appears that a wide range of effective conservational practices has\r\nresulted solely from the effort to make more money through more\r\nefficient operations, and this is likely to be true in the future. Many\r\nimprovements in mining, grading, sorting, concentration, and metallurgy\r\nof minerals, to yield larger financial returns, are coming naturally\r\nthrough private initiative, under the driving power of self-interest.\r\n\r\nAnother considerable group of conservational practices is possible only\r\nto governments or other public agencies. This group of practices on the\r\nwhole requires some sacrifice of the immediate financial interest of the\r\nindividual, in the interests of the community as a whole, or in the\r\ninterests of posterity. In this group may be mentioned the compulsory\r\nuse of methods of mining, sorting, and metallurgy which tend to conserve\r\nsupplies but result in higher prices; the control of prices; the\r\nelimination or lowering of the so-called resource or royalty value (p.\r\n375); and the removal of restrictions on private combination or\r\ncooperation, leading to more efficient methods, lessening of cost, and\r\nbetter distribution of the product; or, what might amount to the same\r\nthing, the acquirement by the government of the resources to be operated\r\non this larger scale.\r\n\r\nThe most effective conservation measures yet in effect are the ones\r\ndictated by self-interest and instituted by private initiative.\r\nGovernmental measures are not yet in effective operation. Illustrations\r\nof these two types of conservational effort are cited in relation to\r\ncoal on later pages.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INTEREST RATE AS A GUIDE IN CONSERVATION\r\n\r\nIn striking a balance between the present and the future, economists\r\nhave emphasized the importance of recognizing the interest rate as a\r\nguiding, if not a controlling consideration. It is obviously difficult\r\nfor private capital to make investments of effort and money for the\r\npurpose of conservation which will not be returned with interest some\r\ntime in the future. For the present, at least, this consideration\r\nfurnishes the best guide to procedure in the field of private endeavor.\r\nSo far as conservational measures, such as investment in an improved\r\nprocess of concentrating low-grade ores, promise return of capital and\r\nan adequate interest rate in the future, they are likely to be\r\nundertaken.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that governments are not so closely bound by this economic\r\nlimitation. They can afford to carry their investments in raw materials\r\nand processes at a lower interest rate than the private investor. Their\r\ncredit is better. Taxes do not figure so directly. They can balance\r\nlosses in one field against gains in another. As a matter of insurance\r\nfor the future of the nation, a government may feel justified in\r\ninaugurating conservational measures for a particular resource without\r\nhope of the interest return which would be necessary to the private\r\ninvestor. In appraising the iron ores of Lorraine taken over by France\r\nfrom Germany at the close of the war, the actual commercial value of\r\nthese ores, as figured by the ordinary _ad valorem_ method, was only\r\nninety millions of dollars. It is clear, however, that to France as a\r\nnation the reserves were worth more. They could afford to pay more for\r\nthem, and could afford to spend more money on conservational practice\r\nthan under ordinary commercial limitations, because of the larger\r\nintangible and more or less sentimental interest.\r\n\r\nThe valuation of this larger interest, as a means of determining the\r\nlimit to which conservational investments may be made, lies in the\r\npolitical field. It may be suggested, however, that a desirable first\r\nstep in any governmental program of conservation is to ascertain the\r\ncost and the possibility of an adequate return of capital and interest.\r\nThese determinations at least afford a definite point of departure, and\r\na means for measuring the cost to the people of measures which are not\r\ndirectly self-supporting.\r\n\r\n\r\nANTI-CONSERVATIONAL EFFECTS OF WAR\r\n\r\nExperience during the recent past indicates that the exploitation of\r\nmineral resources for war purposes is on the whole anti-conservational.\r\nIt is true that the vast amount of war-time exploration and development,\r\nas well as the thoroughgoing investigations of the utilization of\r\nvarious minerals, have led to better knowledge of the mineral resources\r\nand their possibilities. It is also true that the war required a much\r\nmore exhaustive census of mineral possibilities than ever before\r\nattempted. The immediate and direct effect of the war, however, was the\r\nintensive use of mineral resources without careful regard to cost,\r\ngrade, or many other factors which determine their use in peace times.\r\nFor instance, in ordinary times considerable quantities of\r\nhigh-phosphorus iron ores are mined; but, because of the fact that such\r\nores require more time for conversion into steel, war-time practice\r\nconcentrated on the higher-grade, low-phosphorus ores, resulting in an\r\nunbalanced production which in some cases amounted almost to robbing of\r\nore deposits. In the case of coal, quantity was almost the only\r\nconsideration; it was impossible to grade and distribute the coal to\r\nmeet the specialized demands of industry. The results were a general\r\nlowering of the standards of metallurgical and other industrial\r\npractices, and increased cost. High-grade coals were used where\r\nlower-grade coals were desirable for the best results. In the making of\r\nsteel, it is the custom to select the coal and coke with great care in\r\nregard to their content of phosphorus, sulphur, ash, and other\r\nconstituents which affect the composition of the steel product; but\r\nduring the war it became necessary to accept almost any kind of coal,\r\nwith a resulting net loss in quantity and in grade of output.\r\n\r\nFor a considerable number of mineral resources, such as the\r\nferro-alloys, foreign sources of supply were cut off during the war,\r\nrequiring the development and use, at high cost, of low-grade scattered\r\nsupplies in the United States. It was found possible to produce enough\r\nchromite in the United States for domestic requirements, but at two or\r\nthree times the normal price of imported chromite. The grade was low and\r\nthe loss in efficiency to the consuming interests was a high one. The\r\nextremely limited natural supplies were raided almost to the point of\r\nexhaustion.\r\n\r\nWith the post-war resumption of importation of minerals of this kind,\r\nproducers naturally began a fight for a protective tariff, and the\r\nquestion is yet unsettled. The tariff, if enacted, would in most cases\r\nhave to be a high one in order to permit the use of domestic supplies.\r\nThe results would be a large increase in cost to other industries,\r\ndecreased efficiency, and the early exhaustion of limited supplies in\r\nthis country. Most of the mineral resources have been concentrated by\r\nnature in a comparatively few places in the world; and when the two\r\nelements of conservation are considered--the materials themselves and\r\nthe human energy expended in obtaining and using them--it is clear that\r\nany measure which interferes with the natural distribution of the\r\nfavored ores is anti-conservational from the world standpoint.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSERVATION OF COAL\r\n\r\nIn the sections on mineral resources, there are many casual references\r\nto conservation of specific minerals. Here we shall not go further than\r\nto introduce a brief discussion of the conservation of coal as\r\nillustrative of the general problem of conservation of mineral\r\nresources.\r\n\r\nIt has been estimated that the United States possesses, to a depth of\r\n3,000 feet, in beds 14 inches or over, 3,538,554,000,000 tons of coal,\r\nand an additional reserve between 3,000 and 6,000 feet of\r\n666,600,000,000 tons.[42] If all the unmined coal to a depth of 3,000\r\nfeet could be placed in one great cubic pile, the pile would be 18 miles\r\nlong, 18 miles wide, and 18 miles high. Of the original amount of coal\r\nto this depth only about 0.4 of 1 per cent has been mined or wasted in\r\nmining. The wastage is estimated at about 50 per cent. If the annual\r\nproduction of coal were to remain the same as in recent years, the total\r\nlife of the coal reserves (to a depth of 3,000 feet) would be between\r\n4,000 and 6,000 years; but if the acceleration of production of recent\r\nyears were to be maintained in the future, the life would be but little\r\nover 100 years, and the life of the highest-grade coal now being mined\r\nmight not be over 50 years. All agree that the acceleration of\r\nproduction is not likely to continue indefinitely, which will mean that\r\nthe life of coal reserves to 3,000 feet will be somewhere between the\r\ntwo extremes named. It seems clear that actual shortage of coal will not\r\nbe felt for some hundreds of years; but this period of years is short as\r\ncompared with the probable life of the race.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEASURES INTRODUCED OR PROPOSED TO CONSERVE COAL\r\n\r\nThe following list of measures for conservation of coal is taken from\r\nseveral sources. The exhaustive report of the British Coal\r\nCommission,[43] published in 1905, contains a considerable number of\r\nspecific recommendations for conservation of the coal of Great Britain.\r\nThe reports of the National Conservation Commission[44] of the United\r\nStates, published in 1909, treat of the conservation of the coal of the\r\nUnited States and naturally follow some of the recommendations of the\r\nBritish report. The coal section of the National Conservation report was\r\nprepared by M. R. Campbell and E. W. Parker of the U. S. Geological\r\nSurvey, and is contained in U. S. Geological Survey Bulletin 394. The\r\nrecommendations there given are amplified and developed by Van Hise[45]\r\nin his book on Conservation, published in 1910. Since that time the\r\nsubject has been discussed by Smith, Chance, Burrows, Haas,[46] and\r\nothers, and certain additional conservational methods have been\r\nproposed. A considerable number of men have also discussed the\r\nsociologic and economic aspects of the question. The report of the\r\nConservation Commission of Canada,[47] published in 1915, treats rather\r\nfully of the conservation of mineral resources.\r\n\r\nIt will suit our purpose, and avoid some repetition, if we group most\r\nof these recommendations without regard to authorship. In general, these\r\nrecommendations can be grouped under the heads: (A) Methods of mining\r\nand preparation of coal; (B) Improvement of labor and living conditions\r\nat the mines; (C) Introduction or modification of laws to regulate or to\r\nremove certain restrictions on the coal industry; (D) Distribution and\r\ntransportation of coal; (E) Utilization of coal; (F) Substitutes for\r\ncoal as a source of power.\r\n\r\n=(A) Mining and preparation of coal.= Under this heading may be included\r\na large number of proposals which concern primarily the engineering\r\ntreatment of the coal underground and in the mine plants. Some of the\r\nmore important measures are:\r\n\r\n1. Introduction of the long-wall system of mining in places where the\r\nconditions allow it, in order to minimize the waste underground.\r\n\r\n2. Modification of the room-and-pillar system of mining, by which larger\r\npillars are left while the mine advances, and are recovered in the\r\nretreat,--thereby recovering a larger percentage of coal than under the\r\nold system, where small, thin pillars were left, which failed and were\r\npermanently lost.\r\n\r\nIt has been argued that the great loss of coal by leaving it in pillars\r\ncould be saved by using other material to support the roof; but an\r\nelementary calculation of the cost of this procedure shows that it is\r\ncheaper to use the coal. Chance[48] says:\r\n\r\n     The coal left as pillars to support the roof is thus utilized\r\n     and performs a necessary and useful function, yet the\r\n     principal part (perhaps two-thirds) of the 200,000,000 tons\r\n     our friends the conservationists claim is wilfully and\r\n     avoidably wasted every year is this coal that is left in\r\n     pillars to support the roof. I think we can safely claim that\r\n     this is not waste, but, on the contrary, is engineering\r\n     efficiency of the highest type, in that it utilizes the\r\n     cheapest and least valuable material available to support the\r\n     roof and saves the whole labor cost of building supports of\r\n     other materials. Investigation as to what becomes of that part\r\n     of the 200,000,000 tons claimed as wasted, which is not\r\n     utilized as pillars to support the roof, will disclose the\r\n     fact that a very large portion is coal that is left in mine\r\n     workings that are abandoned because the roof is unsafe and\r\n     because a continuance of operation would result in injuries or\r\n     loss of life. Coal left in the mines in order to conserve\r\n     human lives cannot be classed as avoidable waste. A small part\r\n     of the 200,000,000 tons is lost because it is intimately mixed\r\n     with refuse and because the labor cost of recovering it and\r\n     separating it from the refuse would be greater than its value.\r\n\r\n3. Mining of shallow bituminous beds by means of the steam shovel.\r\nProgress has been made along this line in the last few years, and\r\nvaluable deposits are thus mined which can be mined profitably by no\r\nother method.\r\n\r\n4. New methods of filling mined-out spaces with sand, and new methods of\r\nmine survey and design. According to Haas[49]\r\n\r\n     the greatest advance in the question of method was the system\r\n     of mine survey and design perfected in both the anthracite and\r\n     bituminous fields. The relatively new method of filling old\r\n     spaces with sand, etc., has also achieved success.\r\n\r\n5. Use of methods by which coal is not left in the roof for the support\r\nwhere the roof is weak, and by which coal of inferior quality is not\r\nleft in the roof.\r\n\r\n6. Wider use of coal-cutting machines by which the wasting of thinner\r\nbeds may be avoided.\r\n\r\n7. Where conditions allow it, the working of the upper beds before the\r\nlower, in order not to destroy the upper ones by caving. The mining of a\r\nlower coal seam has often so broken up the overlying strata as to render\r\nit impossible to recover the upper coal seams contained therein. There\r\nare certain difficulties, however, in the way of this conservational\r\nmeasure. In some localities the seams are under separate ownership, and\r\nthere is a resulting conflict of interests. Also, if the better coal\r\nseam happens to be below and the poorer seams above, market conditions\r\nmay require that the lower seam be mined regardless of the destruction\r\nof the upper ones.\r\n\r\n8. Elimination of coal barriers to mark the limits between properties.\r\nThis involves more cooperation.\r\n\r\n9. Improvement of mining machinery, power drills, etc.\r\n\r\n10. Centralization of power stations, rather than the use of many small\r\nunits.\r\n\r\n11. Elimination of the wasting of slack or fine coal, through more\r\ncareful methods of mining, through limitations on the excessive use of\r\npowder and larger use of wedges, through the abolition of laws for the\r\npayment of miners on a run-of-mine basis, and in the case of anthracite\r\nthrough recovery of the \"silt\" or dust caused by mining and sorting. It\r\nhas been argued that the excessive use of powder (\"shooting from the\r\nsolid\") means loss of coal, owing to the fact that it shatters the coal\r\nand makes a relatively large amount of slack, besides being accompanied\r\nby increased danger from fire and explosion and from weakening of the\r\nroof. Although the excessive use of powder makes a large amount of\r\nslack, it does not necessarily result in waste, for this fine coal is\r\ncarefully saved and for certain purposes is as valuable as the lump\r\ncoal. So far as the procedure endangers life, it is of course\r\nobjectionable.\r\n\r\n12. Better use of fine coal. It has been recommended that infirm and\r\nfinely broken coal be washed and compressed, thus avoiding the wasting\r\nof slack coal, which was formerly thrown away or burned. However, in\r\nrecent years there has been comparatively little waste of this kind, for\r\nslack coal in general finds nearly as ready a market as lump coal and\r\nthe use of slack is increasing. There has been much discussion also of\r\nthe possibilities of using the coal waste on the ground to make power\r\nfor electric transmission.\r\n\r\n13. More careful attention to sorting and sizing of all grades of coal\r\ncoming from the mine and to preparation of coals for special uses. On\r\nthe other hand, some operators say that the ends of conservation will be\r\nbest met by limiting the sorting and sizing now practiced. The large\r\nnumber of sizes now put on the market greatly increases the cost of\r\nproduction.\r\n\r\n14. Wider use of the lower-grade fuels of the west, particularly with\r\nthe aid of briquetting.\r\n\r\n=Progress in above methods.= Methods of mining and preparation of coal\r\nhave been improved. Campbell and Parker state:[50]\r\n\r\n     A much greater proportion of the product hoisted is now being\r\n     sent to market in merchantable condition. Part of this is due\r\n     to better and more systematic methods of handling, and part to\r\n     the saving of small sizes which formerly went to the culm\r\n     banks. The higher prices of coal and the development of\r\n     methods for using these small sizes have also made it\r\n     possible, through washing processes, to rework the small coal\r\n     formerly thrown on the culm banks, and these are now\r\n     furnishing several millions of tons of marketable coal\r\n     annually.\r\n\r\nIn general there is increase in the percentage of recovery of coal.\r\nWhereas in the past the loss in mining was said by Campbell and\r\nParker[51] to average 50 per cent, now an extraction of 70 to 90 per\r\ncent may be looked for.\r\n\r\nQuoting from Smith and Lesher:[52]\r\n\r\n     Observation of the advances made in mining methods in the last\r\n     decade or two affords slight warrant for belief in any charge\r\n     of wasteful operation. As consumers of coal we might do well\r\n     to imitate the economy now enforced by the producers in their\r\n     engineering practice. In the northern anthracite field machine\r\n     mining in extracting coal from 22- and 24-inch beds, and\r\n     throughout the anthracite region the average recovery of coal\r\n     in mining is 65 per cent., as against 40 per cent. only twenty\r\n     years ago. Nor are the bituminous operators any less\r\n     progressive in their conservation of the coal they mine.\r\n\r\nIn anthracite mining, powdered coal or \"silt\" has accumulated in\r\nstockpiles and in stream channels to many tens of millions of tons. It\r\nis estimated that this constitutes nearly 6 per cent of the coal mined.\r\nSignificant progress has been made recently in the recovery and use of\r\nthis silt as powdered fuel for local power purposes.\r\n\r\nHowever, physical and commercial conditions do not in all cases allow of\r\nthe full application of these new methods. Once a mine has been opened\r\nup on a certain plan, it is difficult to change it. As a whole the\r\nlonger and better organized companies are better able to change than the\r\nsmaller companies.\r\n\r\nConservation measures of the above kinds, as so far applied, have come\r\nmainly from private initiative based on self-interest,--though the\r\ncooperation of the government has been effective, particularly along\r\neducational and publicity lines.\r\n\r\n=(B) Improvement of labor and living conditions at the mines.= Under\r\nthis heading should be mentioned the improvement of housing, sanitation,\r\nand living conditions; improvements in the efficiency of labor, through\r\nmaking living conditions such as to attract a higher-grade labor supply\r\nand through educational means; the introduction of safety methods; the\r\nintroduction of workmen's compensation and insurance; and other measures\r\nof a similar nature. All these measures as a class are sometimes grouped\r\nunder the name of \"welfare work.\"\r\n\r\nMuch thought and discussion have been devoted to the possibilities of\r\nimprovement of labor and living conditions from the standpoint of\r\nconservation of human energy. In some quarters this subject has been\r\ntreated as being independent of the physical conservation of mineral\r\nresources, and it has been the tendency to assume that conservation of\r\nhuman energy might be more or less inimical to conservation of mineral\r\nresources. Certain of the changes already introduced have undoubtedly\r\nincreased the cost of mining; and, until there was a general increase in\r\nselling price, this increased cost may have had the effect of\r\neliminating certain practices of mineral conservation which might\r\notherwise have been possible. For instance, according to Smith and\r\nLesher:[53]\r\n\r\n     The increased safety in the coal mines that has come through\r\n     the combined efforts of the coal companies, the state\r\n     inspectors, and the Federal Bureau of Mines necessarily\r\n     involves some increase in cost of operation, but the few cents\r\n     per ton thus added to the cost is a small price to pay for the\r\n     satisfaction of having the stain of blood removed from the\r\n     coal we buy. That form of social insurance which is now\r\n     enforced through the workmen's compensation laws alone adds\r\n     from 2 to 5 cents a ton to the cost of coal.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there can be no doubt that large advances have been\r\nmade in welfare movements which were introduced for the purpose of\r\ninsuring a steadier, better, and larger supply of labor, and that the\r\ngeneral gain in efficiency of operation thereby obtained has absorbed a\r\nlarge part of the increased cost.\r\n\r\nIn general, conservation measures of this class have been developed\r\ncooperatively by private and public efforts, without important\r\nsacrifice of private interest. There is obviously room for much wider\r\napplication of such measures, especially in some of the bituminous\r\nfields where conditions are still far from satisfactory.\r\n\r\n=(C) Introduction or modification of laws to regulate or to remove\r\ncertain restrictions on the coal industry.= It has been proposed:\r\n\r\n1. To modify the laws so as to take care of situations where vertically\r\nsuperposed beds are owned by different parties, preventing the proper\r\nmining of the coal by either party.\r\n\r\n2. To modify the laws so as to eliminate conflict in mining practice in\r\ncases where the coal is associated with oil and gas pools.\r\n\r\n3. To allow larger ownership by companies utilizing the coal (now only 3\r\nper cent owned by such companies).\r\n\r\n4. To place restrictions on over-capitalization, which leads to wasteful\r\nmining in order to secure quick and large returns on large capital.\r\n\r\n5. To remove restrictions on concentration of control. This means, as a\r\ncorollary proposition, virtual restriction of competition. Concentration\r\nof control into comparatively few hands has undoubtedly favored\r\nconservation. It is easy to see that the stronger financial condition of\r\nthe large companies makes it possible for them to take fuller advantage\r\nof modern methods of extraction, distribution, and marketing.\r\n\r\nThis proposal was especially urged for the bituminous coal industry\r\nbefore the war in order to avoid over-production and over-development.\r\nThe very wide distribution of the bituminous coals, their enormous\r\nquantity, and their exceedingly diversified ownership had led to\r\nover-development of coal properties. Quoting from Smith and Lesher:[54]\r\n\r\n     In estimating the aggregate losses incurred by society by\r\n     reason of the large number of mines not working at full\r\n     capacity, the facts to be considered are that the capital\r\n     invested in mine equipment asks a wage based on a year of 365\r\n     days of 24 hours, while labor's year averaged last year only\r\n     230 days in the anthracite mines and only 203 days in the\r\n     bituminous mines, with only five to eight hours to the day.\r\n\r\nThese conditions prevented in some cases even the most modest\r\nintroduction of better methods, or of changes that would enhance the\r\naverage profits through a relatively short period of ten or fifteen\r\nyears at the expense of the present year. It was necessary to get at the\r\nbest of the coal available in the cheapest possible way, regardless of\r\nthe losses of coal left in the ground.\r\n\r\nTo some extent the force of this argument was minimized by war and\r\npost-war conditions, but even yet development of coal mines is ahead of\r\ntransportation and distribution.\r\n\r\n6. To allow cooperation in the limitation of output, in the avoidance of\r\ncross freights, in gauging the market in advance, and in division of\r\nterritory, all of which would allow cheaper mining and thus give larger\r\nleeway to conservational measures. This necessarily would be accompanied\r\nby government regulation. According to Van Hise,[55] who was active\r\nbefore the war in advocating this conservational measure, such a\r\nprocedure\r\n\r\n     is neither regulated competition, nor regulated monopoly; but\r\n     the retention of competition, the prohibition of monopoly,\r\n     permission for cooperation and regulation of the latter. In\r\n     Chicago there cannot be one selling agency for the different\r\n     coal companies which operate in Illinois, but there must be\r\n     many selling agencies, and the coal of Pittsburgh must come\r\n     into Illinois and the Illinois coal go toward Pittsburgh;\r\n     every one of which things makes unnecessary costs, but all of\r\n     which are inevitable under the extreme competitive system.\r\n     Because of these facts it is necessary to waste the coal. If\r\n     at the very same prices the different mines could cooperate in\r\n     the limitation of the output, avoidance of cross freights,\r\n     gauging the market in advance, and division of territory, they\r\n     could mine their coal more cheaply, have a greater profit for\r\n     themselves and conserve our resources.\r\n\r\nTo some extent the plan here advocated was put into effect during the\r\nwar by the United States Coal Administration; but the conditions of this\r\ntrial were so complicated by special war requirements, that the\r\nconservational advantages of unified control were not demonstrated.\r\n\r\n7. To reduce the excessive royalties paid to fee owners. Smith and\r\nLesher[56] have recently called attention to the relatively high\r\nresource cost in some of the coal fields, represented by the payment of\r\nroyalties to fee owners. In the case of anthracite the payment averages\r\n32 to 35 cents per ton, and exceptionally runs as high as a dollar per\r\nton. For the bituminous coal the average resource cost is probably not\r\nmuch over five cents a ton. They suggest the possibility of lowering\r\nthis cost by governmental regulation; and make an especially strong\r\nargument for not allowing the government-owned coal lands to go to\r\nprivate owners, who in the future, with the accumulation of interest on\r\nthe investment, will feel justified in asking for a large \"resource\"\r\nreturn in the way of royalty.\r\n\r\nIf the resource cost could be lowered, further introduction of\r\nconservational methods by the operators would be possible without\r\ngreatly increasing the cost to the public.\r\n\r\n8. To require or allow, by government regulation, a raising of the price\r\nof coal to the consumer, thereby allowing wider application of\r\nconservational practices. Some of the increased recoveries of coal above\r\nnoted have been made possible only by increase in the market price. If\r\ncooperation were permitted in the manner described in paragraph 6, the\r\nsame results might be accomplished without increasing the price. Recent\r\nhigh prices caused by the war situation are reflected in the\r\nintroduction of many conservational changes which were not before\r\npossible. However, in some cases the demand for quick results under\r\npresent conditions has an opposite effect, because of the desire to\r\nrealize quick profits regardless of conservation.\r\n\r\n9. The local conservation of coal at the expense of heavier drafts on\r\ncoal of other parts of the world, by imposition of export taxes and\r\npreferential duties, has been discussed. While the effect of such a\r\nmeasure would doubtless be conservational from the standpoint of the\r\nUnited States, it is doubtful if it could be so regarded from the\r\nbroader standpoint of world civilization. Under present world conditions\r\nsuch a step would be disastrous.\r\n\r\n10. Government ownership has been proposed as a means of facilitating\r\nthe introduction of conservation measures. In the United States there is\r\nyet no major movement in this direction. In England the question of\r\nnationalization of coal mines is an extremely live political problem\r\n(see pp. 343, 345-347).\r\n\r\nLittle progress has been made in conservation measures which involve\r\nlegal enactments of the kinds above listed.\r\n\r\n=(D) Distribution, and transportation of coal.= It has been argued that\r\nconservational results would ensue from:\r\n\r\n1. Cheaper transportation.\r\n\r\n2. Larger use of waterways.\r\n\r\n3. Improvement in distribution of the product by partition of the market\r\nand by larger use of local coals. For effectiveness this proposition\r\nwould have to include control of the agencies of distribution, in order\r\nto minimize excessive profits of middlemen.\r\n\r\n4. Purchasing and storage of coal by consumers during the spring and\r\nsummer months in anticipation of the winter requirements, in order to\r\nequalize the present highly fluctuating seasonal demands on the mines\r\nand railroads, and to eliminate the recurring shortages of coal in the\r\nwinter months. This was particularly recommended by the United States\r\nBituminous Coal Commission in a recent report.[57]\r\n\r\n5. Where conditions allow it, conversion of coal into power at the mine\r\nand delivery of power rather than coal to consuming centers. This type\r\nof conservation is being put into practice on a large scale above\r\nWheeling, on the Ohio River, where there has recently been built a two\r\nhundred thousand kilowatt installation for steam-generated electric\r\npower. Some of the power will be delivered to Canton, Ohio, over fifty\r\nmiles away. This plant uses local coal and the cost of coal is figured\r\nat two mills per kilowatt-hour.\r\n\r\nUnder this heading of distribution and transportation of coal, might be\r\nconsidered certain international relations. The international movements\r\nof coal are summarized in another place (pp. 115-117). Anything in the\r\nway of tariffs or trade agreements which would tend to interfere with or\r\nto limit the great natural international movements of coal--which in a\r\nfree field are based on suitability of grade, cost, location,\r\ntransportation, etc.--would be anti-conservational from the world's\r\nstandpoint, although they might be of local and temporary advantage. For\r\ninstance, the coal exported from England, which has heretofore\r\ndominated the international trade of the world, is of a high grade.\r\nAmerican coal available for export is on the whole of considerably lower\r\ngrade, being higher in volatile matter. Unless this coal is beneficiated\r\nat home, it can replace the English coal in the export field only at\r\nincreased cost of transportation and lower efficiency in use. The time\r\nmay come when it will be desirable to ship lower-grade coals long\r\ndistances; but when the two factors of conservation are considered--the\r\nintrinsic qualities of the coal, and the efforts necessary to utilize\r\nit--it would seem to be conservational at this stage to ship to long\r\ndistances only the coal which nature seems specially to have prepared\r\nfor this purpose.\r\n\r\n=(E) Utilization of coal.= Conservational proposals of this kind are:\r\n\r\n1. Substitution of retort coke-ovens for beehive ovens, to save not only\r\na larger quantity of coke but also valuable by-products (see pp.\r\n118-119). Additional improvements in coking ovens may make possible the\r\nmanufacture of some sort of coke from a much wider range of bituminous\r\ncoals than can be used at present.\r\n\r\n2. Larger use of smoke consumers and mechanical stokers.\r\n\r\n3. Larger use of central heating plants, with higher efficiency than\r\nmany local plants.\r\n\r\n4. Substitution of gas engines for steam engines, and improvement of the\r\nsteam engine.\r\n\r\n5. Improvement in methods of smelting, leading to larger output of metal\r\nper ton of coke used. Also the development of electric smelting for\r\ncertain metals.\r\n\r\n6. More careful study and classification of the qualities of coals, in\r\norder to avoid use of higher-grade coals where inferior coals would\r\nserve the purpose.\r\n\r\n7. More consumption at the collieries.\r\n\r\n8. Larger use of powdered coal as fuel.\r\n\r\n9. Improvement of force-draft furnaces.\r\n\r\n10. Larger use of gas, a by-product of coal mining, and extraction of\r\nother by-products.\r\n\r\n11. More efficient transformation of peat and coal into power and light.\r\n\r\n12. The possible use of oil flotation to eliminate foreign mineral\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nMost of the conservation measures above proposed have already been\r\napplied with good results, and with promise of large results for the\r\nfuture. The stimulus has come largely from self-interest. War conditions\r\nin some ways aided and in others hindered these developments. One of the\r\nconspicuous gains was the building of many by-product coke plants, under\r\nthe necessity of securing the nitrates and hydrocarbons for munition and\r\nother purposes.\r\n\r\n=(F) Substitutes for coal as a source of power.= Some of the more\r\nprominent measures along this line which have been discussed are:\r\n\r\n1. Larger use of water power. This has sometimes been popularly assumed\r\nto be, at least potentially, a complete solution of the problem; but\r\nnevertheless it has its distinct limitations.\r\n\r\nWater power has the advantages that its sources are not exhausted by\r\nuse, and that the relatively greater initial cost of a hydro-electric\r\nplant is frequently more than compensated for by the saving in man power\r\nrequired and by the lower operating expense. However, the total amount\r\nof water power which can be developed on a commercial basis is rather\r\nclosely limited, and much of the available power is so distributed\r\ngeographically that it cannot be economically supplied to the industries\r\nwhich need it. Of the total water-power resources of the United States\r\nwhich have been estimated by the Geological Survey to be available for\r\nultimate development, over 70 per cent is west of the Mississippi,--whereas\r\nover 70 per cent of the horse-power now installed in prime movers is east\r\nof the Mississippi. Electric power cannot at present be economically\r\ntransmitted more than a few hundred miles. Furthermore, for many uses of\r\ncoal, as in metallurgical and chemical processes which require the heat\r\nor reducing action of burning coal, and in its use as fuel for ships,\r\nhydro-electric power cannot be substituted. It seems clear that while\r\nthe use of water power will increase, particularly as rising prices of\r\ncoal make possible the development of new sites, it can never take the\r\nplace of the mineral fuels in any large proportion.\r\n\r\nFor the immediate future, measures which have been suggested to extend\r\nthe use of water power include: the more complete utilization of water\r\npowers already in use through more efficient machinery and methods; a\r\ncertain degree of redistribution of industries, so that those requiring\r\nlarge amounts of power may be located in areas where water power is\r\ncheap and abundant; and the interconnection of hydro-electric plants so\r\nthat their full capacity may be used. Some water powers which have been\r\ndeveloped are not being fully utilized because the plants are not\r\nconnected with distribution systems large enough to use all the power.\r\nDuring the war the United States Geological Survey, in cooperation with\r\nthe Fuel Administration and the War Industries Board, collected the\r\ninformation required to prepare maps showing the locations and relations\r\nof power stations and transmission lines throughout the country. This\r\nsurvey of the situation showed many possibilities, which had before been\r\nbut vaguely realized, of interconnections which would increase the\r\nefficiency of the plants.\r\n\r\n2. Substitution of lower-grade coals--of bituminous for anthracite, and\r\nof low-grade bituminous for high-grade bituminous coals. Larger use of\r\nlow-grade western coals. War and post-war conditions have shown Germany\r\nthe way to a wide and effective use of its lignites. This has been\r\naccomplished by cooperation of the government and private interests.\r\nThis vast improvement in methods of treatment and recovery of heating\r\nelements and by-products will doubtless have a widespread effect on\r\nutilization of lignites in other parts of the world.\r\n\r\n3. Substitution of alcohol and natural gas, oil, oil shales, peats,\r\netc., as a source of power. This merely concentrates the conservation\r\nproblem more largely on these minerals, in some of which, at least, it\r\nis already considerably more acute than in the case of coal; it is not a\r\nsolution of the problem, but merely a shifting of emphasis.\r\n\r\nBusiness conditions have limited private enterprise in this class of\r\nmeasures, but some progress has been made. More rapid introduction of\r\nthese measures would require sacrifice of private interest and probably\r\nmay be accomplished only by application of public power.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIVISION OF RESPONSIBILITY BETWEEN GOVERNMENT AND PRIVATE INTERESTS\r\nIN THE CONSERVATION OF COAL\r\n\r\nA review of the conservation measures above listed indicates that many\r\nof them are already in operation, and that the initiative for such\r\nmeasures has been largely supplied by private ownership endeavoring to\r\nadvance its own interest. In this category are to be included most of\r\nthe improvements in physical methods of mining, preparation, and\r\nutilization of coal, the use of substitutes for coal, the concentration\r\nof control into larger groups better able to introduce new methods, and\r\nthe improvement of labor and living conditions; also, under recent\r\nconditions, the increase in selling price, allowing for a wider\r\napplication of these measures. Another group of conservation proposals,\r\nwhich have not yet been put into substantial effect, are obviously\r\nbeyond the power of private interests; and must be introduced, if at\r\nall, by the application of government power. These include the\r\nelimination of resource or royalty costs, the control of\r\nover-capitalization, the removal of restrictions on concentration of\r\ncontrol, the granting of permission for cooperation among competitive\r\nunits, the regulation of selling price minimums in order to insure\r\nduring normal times the use of better physical practices, and the\r\ncontrol of distribution. In short, it appears that there are two great\r\nspheres of conservational activity--one within the field of private\r\nendeavor, and the other possible only by collective action through the\r\ngovernment. The principal advances thus far made have been in the field\r\nof private endeavor.\r\n\r\nThe government has aided greatly in the advancement of conservation\r\nmeasures arising within the field of private endeavor. One need only\r\nrefer to many governmental investigations, to the spreading of\r\ninformation as to best methods, and to local compulsory requirements\r\nthat the best practices be made uniform and that backward interests\r\nthereby be brought into line.\r\n\r\nRecognition of the fact that there is a large body of sound\r\nconservational practice in the coal industry which falls within the\r\nrange of self-interest seems essential in planning further changes in\r\nthe direction of conservation. Conservational measures do not all\r\nrequire sacrifice of the individual to the public, nor of the present to\r\nthe future generations. An exercise of public power is not in all cases\r\nessential to the advancement of conservation. The respective limits of\r\nthe fields of public and private endeavor are not sharply defined, and\r\nvary from place to place and time to time, depending upon local\r\nconditions and special requirements.\r\n\r\nIn general, the sphere of private interest includes measures which will\r\nbring adequate commercial return. The interest rate is the limiting and\r\ncontrolling factor. When it is possible--by improvement of methods of\r\nmining, better planning, better preparation of coal, better\r\ntransportation and distribution, or better utilization--to secure a\r\nlarger average return on the investment, or to insure return through a\r\nlonger period of years, self-interest naturally requires the\r\nintroduction of such methods as rapidly as financial conditions allow.\r\nEven some of the improvements in labor and welfare conditions have been\r\nintroduced in this way, with a view to securing a more permanent and\r\nmore efficient labor supply, and thereby aiding the enterprise from the\r\ncommercial standpoint.\r\n\r\nWithin the sphere of government activity lie the removal of unnecessary\r\nrestrictions on private initiative, and such conservation measures as\r\ninvolve some sacrifice of individual returns--in other words, a\r\nreduction of the normal interest rate. Exercise of government power may\r\nbe directly helpful within the field of private endeavor without\r\nmaterially sacrificing private interests; but beyond this point there\r\nare additional large possibilities of conservational activity which are\r\nclearly beyond the control of private interests. The introduction of any\r\nof these latter changes would evidently be so far-reaching in effect,\r\nand would require such broad readjustments not only within but without\r\nthe mineral industry, that the necessity or desirability is not in all\r\ncases so clear as in the case of measures already introduced for private\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nThe most obviously helpful step possible to the government in the\r\nimmediate future is to permit cooperative arrangements under private\r\nownership,--which would make it possible to use common selling agencies,\r\nthereby reducing the cost of selling; to divide the territory to be\r\nserved, thereby avoiding excessive cross freights; and to allot the\r\noutput in proportion to the demand from various territories, thus\r\neliminating excessive competition and over-production. All of these\r\nmeasures could be accomplished without detriment to the public if\r\nproperly regulated by the government. The very large saving possible by\r\nthis means would allow the introduction of conservational methods at the\r\nmines without raising the cost to the public.\r\n\r\nWar conditions required even more immediate and sweeping application of\r\ngovernment power than above indicated, but conservational purposes were\r\nquite overshadowed by other considerations.\r\n\r\nWhere the mineral resources are already owned by the government, or can\r\nbe acquired by the government, some of the troublesome factors in the\r\nproblem are removed. In such cases it is possible to work out an\r\nintelligent plan for government control without the difficulties which\r\narise in dealing with private ownership,--although, of course, new\r\ndifficulties are introduced (see also pp. 345-347.)\r\n\r\nThe fact that there are conservational measures possible only to\r\ngovernments has been widely used as an argument for introducing\r\ngovernment ownership or control. Recent vigorous demands for the\r\nnationalization of natural resources in Europe, and the increasing\r\ndiscussion of the subject in this country, may be regarded as phases of\r\nthe conservation problem. It is not the purpose here to argue either for\r\nor against the drastic exercise of government power in the conservation\r\nof natural resources, but merely to call attention to the measures which\r\nare being discussed.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSERVATION OF MINERALS OTHER THAN COAL\r\n\r\nThe discussion of conservation as applied to specific minerals might be\r\nextended almost indefinitely; but perhaps enough has been said to\r\nindicate the general nature of the field. Before the war careful\r\nestimates of world supplies had been made for comparatively few\r\nminerals, although these included some of the most important, such as\r\ncoal, oil, and iron. War conditions required a hasty estimate of world\r\nreserves of most of the mineral products. The reader interested in the\r\nproblem will find an extremely interesting body of literature issued by\r\nthe various governments on this subject. Of especial interest to the\r\nAmerican reader will be the reports of the U. S. Geological Survey and\r\nof the Bureau of Mines.\r\n\r\nIn recent years there has been increasing recognition of the\r\npossibilities of conservational saving by concentration, refinement, and\r\neven manufacture of mineral commodities at or near the point of\r\norigin,--thus lessening the tonnage involved in transportation of the\r\ncrude products. Limitations of fuel and other conditions often make this\r\nprocedure difficult; but considerable progress is being made both\r\nthrough private initiative and, especially in international trade,\r\nthrough governmental regulations of great variety.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[42] Campbell, M.

In this chapter we are concerned primarily\r\nwith the part which moves between countries. It may be assumed that the\r\nconsumption within the countries of origin is a matter of national\r\nrather than international concern.\r\n\r\nIn pre-war times minerals constituted about 33 per cent[58] of the value\r\nof the total foreign trade of the United States, and 28 per cent of the\r\nforeign trade of Germany. Figures are not available to show the\r\nproportion of mineral tonnage to that of other commodities.\r\n\r\nOne of the several interesting facts in this world movement of minerals\r\nis that the movement of most of them shows a rather remarkable\r\nconcentration. For instance, manganese moves from three principal\r\nsources to four or five consuming centers. Chromite moves from two\r\nprincipal sources; tungsten also from two. Even for certain commodities\r\nwhich are widely distributed and move in large amounts, the\r\nconcentration of movement is rather marked; for instance, the world\r\nmovement of coal is controlled by England, the United States, and\r\nGermany. In other words, although the world movement of mineral\r\ncommodities is widespread and exhibits many complex features, most of\r\nthe individual minerals follow two or three salient lines of movement.\r\nThis means in general that for each mineral there are certain sources of\r\nlimited geographic extent, which, because of location, grade, relation\r\nto transportation, cost--in short, all the factors that enter into\r\navailability--are drawn upon heavily for the world's chief demands. The\r\nconvergence of these materials toward a few consuming centers indicates\r\ngenerally concentration of coal production necessary to smelting, high\r\ndevelopment of manufacturing, large per capita use, concentration of\r\nfacilities, strong financial control, and, not least, a large element of\r\nenterprise which has taken advantage of more or less favorable\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nIf a nation were fully supplied with mineral resources, without excess,\r\nthe mineral problem might be almost exclusively domestic in its nature.\r\nBut no country is so situated. For most of the mineral products the\r\ndominant supply is likely to be controlled by one or two nations, the\r\nother nations being correspondingly deficient and dependent. Even the\r\nUnited States, which is more nearly self-sustaining in mineral resources\r\nthan any other country, is almost wholly dependent on other countries\r\nfor certain mineral supplies; and in the case of minerals of which it\r\nhas an excess it is dependent on other countries for markets. The view\r\nthat the mineral resource problem is solely a local and national one, of\r\nno concern to outsiders, ignores this fundamental fact of distribution\r\nof raw materials.\r\n\r\nControl of smelting facilities makes it possible for certain countries\r\nto exercise considerable influence over the production and distribution\r\nof minerals in other countries, and thus presents many difficult\r\ninternational questions. Even more difficult are the international\r\nproblems created by the commercial ownership and control of minerals in\r\nthe ground by nationals of other countries.\r\n\r\nThe national and international aspects of mineral resources are\r\ndifficult to separate, so intimately do they react on each other. To\r\nsome extent there may be conflict of interest between the two, but in\r\nthe main the international questions may be logically approached from\r\nthe standpoint of national self-interest; for, in the conduct of the\r\nnational industry along broad and enlightened lines, world conditions\r\nmust necessarily be considered. A clearer comprehension of the world\r\nmineral relations, and an understanding of our own opportunities and\r\nlimitations in comparison with those of our neighbors, cannot but\r\neliminate some of the unnecessary handicaps to the best use of the world\r\nmineral resources, and result in a lessening of causes of international\r\ndiscord.\r\n\r\nA brief survey of the mineral conditions preceding, during, and\r\nfollowing the war may serve as a convenient means of approach to a study\r\nof the present international aspects of the mineral problem.\r\n\r\n\r\nMOVEMENT OF MINERALS UNDER PRE-WAR CONDITIONS OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE\r\n\r\nIf the world pre-war movement of minerals is considered broadly, it may\r\nbe regarded as conforming essentially to normal trade conditions of\r\nsupply and demand. There have been barriers to overcome, such as tariffs\r\nand trade controls and monopolies of various kinds, but these barriers\r\nhave not prevented the major movements between the best sources of\r\nsupply and the principal consuming centers. These movements may be\r\nregarded as a more or less spontaneous internationalization of mineral\r\nresources by private enterprise. The aim of free trade or unrestricted\r\ncommerce was equality of trade opportunities; but such conditions of\r\nunrestricted competition tended to concentrate trade in the hands of the\r\nstrongest interests and to prevent equality of opportunity.\r\n\r\nThe efforts made to promote or hinder international mineral movements by\r\ntariffs, bonuses, embargoes, subsidies, transport control, patents,\r\ngovernment management, financial pressure, and other means have been\r\nincited mainly by national or imperial self-interest, and have thus been\r\nto some extent inimical to an internationalization based on the\r\nprinciple of the greatest good to the greatest number. It may be\r\nsupposed that, in any effort to attain supernational or international\r\ncontrol, motives and measures based on national self-interest of the\r\nsort here mentioned will continue to play an important part.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHANGES DURING THE WAR\r\n\r\nThe war wrought fundamental changes in the world movement of minerals.\r\nThe character and distribution of the demands changed. Customary sources\r\nof supply were cut off. Financial disturbances and ship shortage\r\nprofoundly modified the nature, distribution, and extent of the world\r\nmovement. Our domestic mineral industry was abruptly brought to a\r\nrealization of its vital relations with international trade. To\r\nillustrate, the large movement of manganese from India and Russia to the\r\nUnited States was abruptly stopped, and we had to develop a source of\r\nsupply in Brazil. The stoppage of pyrite importations from Spain as a\r\nmeans of saving ships required the development of pyrite and sulphur\r\nsupplies in the United States. The export of oil from the United States\r\nto European countries was greatly stimulated, and the export to other\r\ncountries was correspondingly decreased. The world movements of coal\r\nwere vitally affected, principally by the limitation of the coal\r\nshipments from England and the United States to South America and the\r\nconcentration of shipments to European countries. The closing of German\r\ncoal supplies to nearby countries also had far-reaching consequences.\r\nThe cutting off of the German potash left the world for the time being\r\nalmost unsupplied with this vital fertilizing ingredient. The Chilean\r\nnitrates, on which the world had relied for fertilizer purposes, were\r\ndiverted almost exclusively to the manufacture of powder. The total\r\nannual imports of mineral commodities into the United States were\r\nreduced by 1,200,000 tons. Our exports, though they continued in large\r\nvolume, were mainly concentrated in Europe. The story of these\r\ndisturbances in the world movement of minerals, though highly\r\ninteresting, is too long to be told here.\r\n\r\nOut of these sweeping and rapid changes in the world movement of mineral\r\ncommodities there arose, partly as cause and partly as effect,\r\ninternational agreements for the allocation of minerals, as a means of\r\ninsuring the proper proportions of supplies to the different countries\r\nfor the most effective prosecution of the war. Inter-Allied purchasing\r\ncommittees in London and in Paris found it necessary to make an\r\ninter-Allied allocation of the output of Chilean nitrate, because the\r\nsum of the demands exceeded the total supply by a considerable fraction,\r\nand to agree on the distribution and prices of the world's supplies of\r\ntin, tungsten, and platinum. For many other commodities agreements of\r\nvarious sorts were made. For instance, the United States entered into an\r\nagreement with England and France for the purchase of iron ore and\r\nmolybdenum from Scandinavia to keep it out of Germany. The United States\r\nand England agreed as to supplying Canada with ferromanganese. New\r\nproblems of world allocation came up almost daily.\r\n\r\nAnother war change in mineral conditions, of a more permanent nature,\r\nwas the liquidation of German ownership and control of minerals in\r\nallied countries, and in some cases even in neutral countries.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOST-WAR CONDITION OF THE MINERAL TRADE\r\n\r\nThe mineral industry has by no means reverted to its pre-war condition.\r\nThe old movements have been only partially resumed, and new elements\r\nhave entered. Shipping is still disturbed. Governments have been\r\ncooperating in various ways in the liquidation of government stocks of\r\nminerals. The German commercial control of minerals outside of its\r\nboundaries, as noted above, has been much weakened. The Reparations\r\nCommittee created by the Peace Treaty has enormous powers over the use\r\nand distribution of the mineral resources of Germany, which directly and\r\nindirectly affect the mineral supplies of Europe and all the world. The\r\nterms of the Peace Treaty changed in fundamental ways the international\r\nchannels of mineral movement.\r\n\r\nThe mineral situation of Europe is in such a state of chaos that the\r\ncombined efforts of governments will be necessary for many years to\r\nbring order. This will be accomplished partly through the Reparations\r\nCommittee, but may require other forms of cooperation. An international\r\ncoal commission has already been formed to look after the distribution\r\nof coal through Europe. International cooperation in mineral\r\ndistribution is not merely a theoretical possibility for the future,--it\r\nis now the outstanding fact with reference to the European situation.\r\n\r\nThe recognition of their dependence on neighbors for important mineral\r\nresources has led to earnest efforts on the part of nations to supply\r\ndeficiencies. The great activity of the British government in acquiring\r\noil is one example. The falling off of gold production the world over,\r\ntogether with the increased disparity between gold reserves and the\r\ncurrency issued against them, is causing serious consideration of\r\ngovernment action to encourage the gold industry by financial measures\r\ntending to increase the profit of the miners (see pp. 224-225).\r\n\r\nBefore and since the war most countries of the globe, outside of England\r\nand the United States, have gone far in the exercise of the right of\r\neminent domain over mineral resources within their own boundaries. Even\r\nin England the recent movement to nationalize the coal and oil resources\r\nis an indication of the general tendency. In the United States the\r\nmovement has manifested itself thus far only in the increasing\r\nreluctance on the part of the government to part with mineral resources\r\non the public domain,--as is clear from the terms of its new leasing law\r\nto cover oil, coal, gas, potash, and phosphates on public lands.\r\n\r\nBefore the war only the German government was clearly identified with\r\nprivate interests in international trade and in the acquirement of\r\nmineral reserves. Since the war all governments except that of the\r\nUnited States are taking an active part in these fields, both directly\r\nand in cooperation with private capital. The British government has\r\ntaken a direct financial interest in certain companies, such for\r\ninstance as the Anglo-Persian and Shell Oil Companies, and in some cases\r\nis actively interested in the acquirement of selling contracts. In\r\nEngland there is a wider use of voting trusts in controlling private\r\ncompanies, with the purpose of preventing the control from falling into\r\nalien hands. Government control of shipping in certain countries is\r\ninvolving various degrees of control of mineral movements. Also, through\r\nloans and bonds, mineral resources in certain countries have been tied\r\nup by the loaning governments. There has been wide extension of\r\ngovernment control of minerals in mandatory territories and elsewhere\r\nthrough many new loans and regulations. These steps are in effect\r\nclosing important parts of the world to private initiative, and\r\nparticularly to nationals of other countries. Whether these activities\r\nof governments are economically desirable or not, they are the actual\r\nconditions, not theories.\r\n\r\nIf this situation continues, it raises the question whether our\r\ngovernment will not be forced, in protection of its own mineral\r\nindustries, also to take a direct part; for under present conditions,\r\nour importers and exporters find themselves dealing single-handed with\r\ngovernments or with private groups so closely identified with\r\ngovernments as to have much the same power. In matters of shipping,\r\ncredits, exchange, tariffs, embargoes, and opportunity to acquire\r\nforeign reserves, the actual and potential disadvantage to American\r\ninterests is obvious.\r\n\r\n\r\nTENDENCIES TOWARD INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION AND POSSIBILITY OF\r\nINTERNATIONAL CONTROL[59] OF MINERALS\r\n\r\nUnder the pre-war conditions, unrestricted competition in world trade by\r\nprivate enterprise had led to a certain kind of internationalization of\r\nmineral deposits based on natural conditions of availability. There is a\r\nnatural tendency to work back as quickly as possible to this condition,\r\nbut new elements have entered which seem to make it difficult for\r\ngovernments to keep their hands off. The participation of governments in\r\nworld mineral trade, when not modified by international cooperation or\r\nsome other higher form of control, seems to be having a tendency in the\r\nopposite direction--to be closing the doors of equal opportunity and\r\npreventing the natural world use of the world's resources.\r\n\r\nThese new conditions, together with others outlined in the preceding\r\nsection, have made it necessary to pay more attention to the\r\npossibilities of international cooperation than ever before,--not as a\r\nrestrictive measure, except temporarily in regard to the Central\r\nEuropean powers,--but as a means of insuring open channels of movement\r\nfor raw materials, and of insuring equal economic opportunities to all.\r\nMany of our mineral industries have already appealed to our government\r\nfor cooperation and aid in their international dealings. Further,\r\nmineral industries in private hands in the various Allied countries have\r\nattempted to get together to arrange for private cooperation, and\r\nappealed to the Peace Conference for authority to do so. In certain\r\ncases the necessity for cooperative action became so apparent that\r\npressure was brought to bear on the Peace Conference for the forming of\r\nsome sort of international economic body which would make possible some\r\nof these steps. These movements were all dictated by considerations of\r\nself-interest, but self-interest broadened and educated by a knowledge\r\nof the world's situation.\r\n\r\nJust as the increasing size of the units engaged in the mineral trade\r\nwithin national boundaries has led to discussion of the possibilities of\r\ngovernment control in the interest of the public, so the increasing size\r\nof the units in the international mineral trade, the units in many cases\r\nbeing governments, is leading to discussion of the possibility of some\r\ninternational or supernational control in the interest of the world\r\ngood. Just as national interest is the lengthened shadow of individual\r\ninterest, so international interest may be regarded in some aspects as\r\nthe lengthened shadow of national interest.\r\n\r\nThe general purpose of the suggested control is to minimize\r\ninternational friction; but more specifically it has been suggested that\r\nsome sort of international cooperation is necessary in order to insure\r\nequality of opportunity among nations, both in supplies and in markets,\r\nand thereby to prevent the crowding of the weaker by the stronger\r\nnations. This is the gist of one of the famous fourteen points. The\r\npurpose might be accomplished by direct allocation of supplies or by\r\ncontrol of tariffs and exchange.\r\n\r\nOne of the conditions which seems to require international cooperation\r\nis the exploitation of mineral deposits in backward countries.\r\nUnrestricted competition among nations in such exploitation has been an\r\nimportant cause of international controversy. It was planned at Peace\r\nConference that the mineral resources in countries taken over by the\r\ngreat powers under mandatories should be developed and used in the\r\ninterest of the group of nations, rather than for the special interest\r\nof the nation taking the mandatory. One of the natural functions of any\r\ninternational or supernational organization would be the adjustment and\r\nsettlement of difficulties arising from this provision.\r\n\r\nThis topic brings up the question as to the right of any nation or group\r\nof nations to exert any force on weaker nations in the exploitation of\r\nmineral resources. On the principal of self-determination and of the\r\ncomplete freedom of action of nations, this procedure seems unjustified.\r\nOn the other hand, whether rightly or wrongly, civilization has created\r\ngreat material demands which must be satisfied. The individuals,\r\ncompanies, and governments which use force to exploit resources in\r\nweaker countries are merely the agents in supplying the demand created\r\nby all of us. While their methods are often indefensible, the exploiters\r\ncannot be regarded merely as irresponsible buccaneers who are\r\nprojecting themselves unnecessarily into somebody else's business.\r\nWhatever the sentimental and ethical aspects of the question, it seems\r\nalmost inevitable that the demands of civilization will continue to\r\nrequire the exploitation of weaker countries; and in proportion as these\r\ncountries are backward in cooperating, they must feel the world\r\npressure. An agreement for international cooperation in such matters,\r\ntherefore, is not to be regarded as merely a cold-blooded attempt to rob\r\nweaker nations,--but rather as a means of improving methods in\r\nsatisfying the actually existing material demands of civilization. For\r\nillustration, the criticism of England's attempt to develop the oil\r\nindustry of Mesopotamia and Persia has to a large extent confused the\r\nmethods with the aim sought for. It is the writer's view that\r\ndevelopment of these resources is inevitable, and that criticism should\r\nnot be directed toward nations and groups attempting to attain these\r\nresults, but rather to the methods applied. For the purposes of this\r\ndiscussion, it is not necessary to go beyond the acceptance of the fact\r\nof demand, nor to argue the question as to whether the material demands\r\nof civilization should be curbed and progress restricted to matters of\r\nmind and human happiness.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHODS OF INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION\r\n\r\nThe first step in international consideration of minerals is obviously\r\none of fact-finding. This became painfully evident during the great war,\r\nwhen the sudden cutting off of outside supplies and markets brought home\r\nthe fact that the mineral question is only in part a domestic one. The\r\naverage mining man had come to take the established marketing and\r\ncommercial conditions more or less for granted, and had not looked into\r\nthe underlying factors. There had been a tendency to assume that a kind\r\nProvidence was in some manner looking after these elements in the\r\nsituation. The nearest approach to Providence, as a matter of fact, was\r\na small group of importers and exporters, possessing special knowledge\r\nof the international movements of certain commodities,--which knowledge\r\nwas of unsuspected importance to the mineral industry. War conditions\r\nshowed that neither the general public nor the mineral industry as a\r\nwhole, much less the government, had even an elementary grasp of the\r\nimportant elements of the world mineral situation. The mobilizing of\r\nthis information under high pressure, through the cooperation of\r\ngovernment and private agencies, was an interesting and important\r\nfeature in the complex activities back of the firing line. It is vastly\r\nto the credit of the men interested in the mineral industry in this\r\ncountry, and presumably also in other countries, that almost without\r\nexception they contributed their bits of knowledge to the common pool,\r\neven though these bits had been in a sense their private capital.\r\nCertain importers, who by their knowledge of international phases of the\r\nmineral situation had been able to exercise a profound influence on\r\ndomestic markets, voluntarily sacrificed their own interest for the\r\ncommon cause and pointed out ways in which reductions of imports could\r\nbe made.\r\n\r\nThe problems of the Peace Conference, and of other international\r\nagreements now pending, have required a still further systematizing of\r\ninternational information. One of the results has been the establishment\r\nof organizations of an international fact-finding character in our own\r\nand in certain other governments. In the chapters on the several\r\nminerals in this book, are summarized some of the salient features of\r\nthe international situation developed by study of the kind indicated.\r\n\r\nKnowledge of the physical facts of the world mineral situation is only a\r\nfirst step. Their interpretation and correlation, the study of the\r\nunderlying principles, the formulation of the necessary international\r\nagreements and regulations, constitute even more difficult problems,\r\nwhich are far from solved.\r\n\r\nThere always has been some cooperation of governments in the mineral\r\ntrade through the ordinary diplomatic channels. The question is now\r\nprominent whether, in view of the new conditions, it may not be\r\nnecessary to develop better machinery--in the form of some international\r\nor supernational organization, possibly patterned on war procedure--in\r\norder to expedite the negotiations and to minimize possibilities of\r\nfriction.\r\n\r\nDuring the war, when the world demand exceeded the total world supply of\r\ncertain commodities, such as nitrate and tin, international commissions\r\nwere formed in order to make an equitable distribution of these minerals\r\nand prevent favored strong nations from taking too large a proportion of\r\nthe total. This procedure presented no insurmountable difficulties. A\r\ncanvass of the total supplies available and of the demands of the\r\nvarious countries ordinarily led to voluntary compromise in the\r\nallocation of supplies. Most of the regulations of these commissions\r\nwere applied to mineral industries which were unable to meet the total\r\ndemand. They were not tried out in cases where there were excess\r\nsupplies; this process obviously would have been much more difficult,\r\nthough perhaps not impossible.\r\n\r\nThe general success of international attempts to allocate mineral\r\nsupplies during the war suggests the lines along which results might be\r\naccomplished during peace. The process is essentially a matter of\r\ngetting at the facts, and then discussing the situation around a\r\ntable,--thus eliminating the long delays and misunderstandings arising\r\nfrom the procedure through the older established diplomatic channels.\r\nHow far such a procedure might be possible without the compelling common\r\ninterest of war is debatable.\r\n\r\nThe great powers of the Reparations Committee, previously noted, and of\r\nthe recently formed European coal commission, already indicate the\r\ngeneral nature of the machinery for international control which might be\r\nexercised through a league of nations. It is not our purpose to argue\r\nfor international control or for any specific plan of control, but\r\nrather to outline the problem. The question is not an academic one.\r\nVarious kinds of international control are present facts, and the\r\nproblem relates to the possibilities of more effective organization of\r\nexisting agencies.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSERVATION IN ITS INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS\r\n\r\nThe interests of conservation, considering both its physical and its\r\nhuman energy phases (p. 362), seem to call for an international\r\nunderstanding in the use of mineral resources which will result in the\r\nminimum hindrance to their free movements along natural channels of\r\ntrade. The essential fact of the concentration of mineral supplies in\r\ncomparatively few world localities, and the fact that no nation is\r\nsupplied with enough of all varieties of minerals, mean that artificial\r\nbarriers to their distribution cannot but impose unnecessary handicaps\r\non certain localities, which may be anti-conservational from a world\r\nstandpoint. If the few countries possessing adequate supplies of\r\nhigh-grade ferro-alloy minerals, for instance, were to restrict their\r\ndistribution by tariffs or other measures, the resulting cost to\r\ncivilization through the handicapping of the steel industry would be a\r\nlarge one. Or if, for the general purpose of making the United States\r\nentirely self-supporting in regard to mineral supplies, sufficiently\r\nhigh import tariffs were imposed on these minerals to permit the use of\r\nthe low-grade deposits in the United States, earlier exhaustion of the\r\nlimited domestic supplies would follow, and in the meantime the cost to\r\nthe domestic steel industry would be serious. Cost may be taken to\r\nrepresent the net result of human energy multiplied into raw material.\r\nThe movement would therefore be anti-conservational. If each state in\r\nthe United States were to start out to become entirely self-sustaining\r\nin regard to minerals, and by various regulations were able to prohibit\r\nthe use of minerals brought in from without, or the export of its excess\r\nof minerals, the waste in effort and materials would be obvious. Nature\r\nhas clearly marked out fields of specialization for different\r\nlocalities, and the effective use of mineral supplies is just as much a\r\nmatter of specialization as the effective use of man's talents. If the\r\nUnited States, because of its vast copper deposits, is in a position to\r\nspecialize in this line and to aid the world thereby, this should\r\ninvolve recognition of the fact that other countries are better able to\r\nspecialize in other commodities,--thereby forming a basis for mutual\r\nexchange, which is desirable and necessary for world development.\r\n\r\nThis conservational argument against artificial barriers does not\r\nnecessarily imply complete elimination of tariffs or other restricting\r\nor fostering measures. Within limits these may be necessary or desirable\r\nin order to maintain differences in the standard of living, or in order\r\nto permit the growth of infant industries; but to carry these measures\r\nto a point where they interfere with essential mineral movements\r\ndetermined by nature is obviously anti-conservational.\r\n\r\nFor some mineral commodities, international cooperation may prevent\r\nduplication in efforts and the development of excessive supplies in\r\nadvance of the capacity of the world to use them. Partly because of lack\r\nof such cooperation, certain mineral commodities have been developed in\r\nsuch large quantities in various parts of the world that it may be many\r\nyears before demand catches up with development. In the meantime, large\r\nand unnecessary interest charges are piling up. This financial loss\r\nmeasures the loss in effectiveness of collective human effort.\r\n\r\nIn the above discussion, little reference has been made to shortage of\r\ntotal world supplies as an argument for international cooperation. This\r\nis an argument often cited, and with some effectiveness during the war.\r\nIt is the writer's view that this phase of the problem has been much\r\nexaggerated. Except for certain periods during the war, in considering\r\nthe world as a whole adequate supplies of all mineral commodities have\r\nbeen available at all times. They have been developed as rapidly as\r\nneeded, in some cases more rapidly; and geological conditions seem to\r\nindicate that this condition will continue for some time in the future,\r\nthrough national and individual effort. Combined efforts of governments\r\nseem hardly necessary as yet to accomplish this purpose. In fact, there\r\nis rather more danger of over-development, without due regard to the\r\nworking of the interest rate, which might be prevented by international\r\ncooperation. The main problem now is not one of total supplies, but of\r\ntheir effective and equitable distribution.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPLORATION IN ITS INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS\r\n\r\nWhen an explorer or prospector leaves his own country to discover and\r\nacquire minerals in other countries, with a view to exportation, it is\r\nreasonably obvious that he must first acquire a sound knowledge of at\r\nleast some of the elements of international trade in minerals,--such as\r\nshipping facilities, rates, tariffs, attitude of the government toward\r\nownership, toward export, etc. For example, the prospector for oil in\r\nforeign countries will not get very far without considering the recent\r\nsteps taken by foreign governments, and mentioned on pp. 131-132.\r\n\r\nThe necessity of study of the international situation in conducting\r\ndomestic exploration is not so generally recognized; and yet anyone\r\ntoday who confines his attention solely to the local physical facts of\r\nthe situation, and who ignores international considerations, may find\r\nhimself in difficulties. The investigation of international questions is\r\nnot merely desirable from the standpoint of general information, but may\r\nbe vital to the business or professional success of the explorer. For\r\ninstance, he might take up the exploration and development in the United\r\nStates of fertilizers and ferro-alloy minerals which are ordinarily\r\nimported; and without understanding the severe limitations imposed by\r\nthe foreign situation, he might find himself with a property, sound from\r\na physical standpoint, but financially a failure. It is comparatively\r\neasy, by running over the long list of mineral commodities used in the\r\nUnited States, to eliminate, on international grounds, a considerable\r\nnumber from the field inviting financial success, and to concentrate on\r\nothers whose economic relations are sound. In the rapid changes during\r\nand since the war, the necessity for consideration of world conditions\r\nhas been brought home at heavy expense to many business and professional\r\nmen engaged in the mineral industry.\r\n\r\n\r\nVALUATION IN ITS INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS\r\n\r\nFor mineral commodities of limited supply and steady demand, market\r\nconditions may be more or less taken for granted, and valuation may be\r\nbased on local considerations. For a large number of mineral resources,\r\nhowever, the competitive market conditions are anything but stable,\r\nbecause of foreign competition. It is necessary not only to know the\r\nbasis for this competition, but also to be able to follow intelligently\r\nits various changes. The value of many of our mineral deposits in recent\r\nyears has varied widely with changes in the foreign situation.\r\n\r\n\r\nRELATIVE POSITION OF THE UNITED STATES IN REGARD TO SUPPLIES OF MINERALS\r\n\r\nThe United States is more nearly self-sustaining in regard to mineral\r\ncommodities as a whole than any other country on the globe. The\r\nfollowing statement summarizes qualitatively our position:\r\n\r\n1. Minerals of which our exportable surplus dominates the world\r\nsituation:\r\n\r\n  Copper.\r\n  Petroleum has belonged in this class until recently. In\r\n    the future imports will be required (see 5 following).\r\n\r\n2. Minerals of which our exportable surplus constitutes an important but\r\nnot a dominant factor in the world trade:\r\n\r\n  Cement.\r\n  Coal.\r\n  Iron and steel.\r\n  Phosphates.\r\n  Silver.\r\n  Sulphur.\r\n  Uranium and radium.\r\n\r\n3. Minerals of which our exportable surplus is not an important factor\r\nin world trade. Small amounts of most of these minerals have been and\r\nwill doubtless continue to be imported because of special grades,\r\nback-haul, or cheaper sources of foreign supply, but these imports are\r\nfor the most part not essential as a source of supply:\r\n\r\n  Aluminum and bauxite.\r\n  Arsenic.\r\n  Artificial abrasives and emery (except Naxos emery).\r\n  Asphalt and bitumen.\r\n  Barite.\r\n  Bismuth.\r\n  Borax.\r\n  Bromine.\r\n  Building stone (except Italian marble).\r\n  Cadmium.\r\n  Feldspar.\r\n  Fluorspar.\r\n  Fuller's earth.\r\n  Gold.\r\n  Gypsum.\r\n  Lead.\r\n  Lime.\r\n  Magnesite.\r\n  Mineral paints (except umber, sienna, and ocher from France and Spain).\r\n  Molybdenum.\r\n  Pyrite.\r\n  Salt (except special classes).\r\n  Talc.\r\n  Titanium.\r\n  Tripoli and diatomaceous earth.\r\n  Zinc.\r\n\r\n4. Minerals for which the United States must depend almost entirely on\r\nother countries:\r\n\r\n  Cobalt.\r\n  Nickel.\r\n  Platinum and metals of the platinum group.\r\n  Tin.\r\n\r\n5. Minerals for which the United States will depend on foreign sources\r\nfor a considerable fraction of the supply:\r\n\r\n  Antimony.\r\n  Asbestos.\r\n  Ball clay and kaolin.\r\n  Chalk.\r\n  Chromite.\r\n  Corundum.\r\n  Diamond dust and bort.\r\n  Garnet.\r\n  Graphite.\r\n  Grinding pebbles.\r\n  Manganese.\r\n  Mercury.\r\n  Mica.\r\n  Monazite.\r\n  Naxos emery.\r\n  Nitrates.\r\n  Petroleum (see below).\r\n  Potash.\r\n  Precious stones.\r\n  Pumice.\r\n  Tungsten.\r\n  Vanadium.\r\n  Zirconium.\r\n\r\nIn the past the production of petroleum in the United States has\r\ndominated the world petroleum situation; but domestic consumption has\r\nnow overtaken production, and unless discoveries of oil come along at a\r\nrapid rate the domestic deficiency seems likely to increase, with\r\ncorresponding increase in our dependence on foreign sources (see pp.\r\n128-132).\r\n\r\nSome of the minerals of this last class, such as potash, manganese, and\r\nchromite were developed under war conditions in the United States to\r\nsuch an extent as to materially lessen the demand for importation; but\r\nin normal times domestic sources can supply a considerable fraction of\r\nthe demand only at high cost and with the aid of a protective tariff.\r\n\r\nNo attempt will be made here to present the detailed figures on which\r\nthe above generalizations are based. In view of the present disturbed\r\nconditions of production and consumption, any judgment as to future\r\ndemands or available surplus must take into account several factors\r\nwhich cannot be accurately measured,--such as financial control in\r\nforeign countries, possible tariffs, and foreign competition. For this\r\nreason the above statement should be regarded as only tentative, though\r\nit is the result of a rather exhaustive study of conditions in relation\r\nto the world control of shipping. The classes named overlap to some\r\nextent, and it is to be expected that some of the commodities placed in\r\none class may in the near future be transferred to another.\r\n\r\nIn terms of value, the United States has a potential export surplus of\r\nminerals about twice as large as that of all the rest of the world put\r\ntogether. Countries which were neutral during the war have the remaining\r\nexport surplus. Great Britain, France, and Italy have net import\r\nrequirements considerably in excess of their exports. Germany has almost\r\nas large a deficit of minerals as the United States has a surplus.\r\n\r\nFrom the above facts it is clear that, in any scheme of international\r\ncontrol or cooperation, the United States would have by far the heaviest\r\nstake, and perhaps the most to lose by restriction. It seems equally\r\nclear that the preponderance of exportable surplus of minerals over\r\nnecessary imports justifies the United States in taking a broad and\r\nliberal view of the importation of needed minerals. The war-time\r\nnecessity of making our country as nearly self-sustaining as possible\r\ndoes not seem to obtain in peace times. To carry that principle to an\r\nextreme means not only the expensive use of low-grade domestic supplies,\r\nbut the elimination of the imports which are so necessary to balance our\r\nexport trade.\r\n\r\nThese facts also raise the question as to how far the United States is\r\njustified in exploiting the rest of the world to add to its already\r\ngreat preponderance of control,--as, for instance, in copper. Any\r\nfurther aggrandizement of our position in regard to such minerals may be\r\ndirectly at the expense of neighbors who are already far less well\r\nsupplied than ourselves, and is to be justified only on the basis of\r\nadding to the world's supply for common use, and of lending our expert\r\nassistance to neighbors to make them more nearly self-supporting. To\r\ncarry out our campaign in these cases without regard to the needs of\r\nother countries will obviously not hasten the ideal of a democratic\r\nworld with equal opportunity for all. On the other hand, the great\r\nfreedom allowed by our laws in regard to foreign commercial control of\r\nour minerals, as compared to the restriction on such control in other\r\ncountries, suggests the desirability of exerting our pressure for the\r\nopen door policy in all parts of the world, in the interest of desirable\r\nreciprocal relations.\r\n\r\nIn this connection there has been a tendency to criticise England's\r\npost-war activity in securing oil reserves for the future. Self-interest\r\nhas clearly dictated the necessity for improving England's weak position\r\nin regard to this vital energy resource. The success of this movement\r\nobviously means a lessening of the future preponderance of the United\r\nStates in the oil industry, and calls for increased activity on the part\r\nof the United States in maintaining the desirable leading position it\r\nhas long held. From the writer's viewpoint, however, the fair success of\r\na rival does not call for criticism of motives. If there is any just\r\ncriticism, it applies to methods (see pp. 390-391).\r\n\r\nWhatever action may be taken by the United States in regard to\r\ninternational mineral questions, it is clear that the war has brought\r\nthis country into such world relations that it has become imperative for\r\nus to study and understand the world mineral situation much more\r\ncomprehensively than before,--in the interest not only of intelligent\r\nmanagement of our own industries, but of far-sighted handling of\r\ninternational relations. Under the stress of war the government,\r\nespecially through the Geological Survey, the Bureau of Mines, and the\r\nseveral war boards, found it necessary to use extraordinary efforts to\r\nobtain even elementary information on the international features of\r\nmineral trade. Much progress has been made, but only a start. The\r\ngeologist or engineer who fails to follow these investigations may be\r\ncaught napping in the economic phases of his work.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COAL AND IRON SITUATION OF WESTERN EUROPE UNDER THE TERMS OF THE\r\nPEACE TREATY\r\n\r\nA mineral problem of special international importance at the present\r\ntime relates to the disposition of the coal and iron resources of\r\nGermany. Germany's coal and iron have been the basis for its commanding\r\nposition in industry and commerce. In fact, its development of these\r\nresources has been probably the most vital element in the European\r\neconomic situation. The terms of the Peace Treaty in regard to these\r\ncommodities have far-reaching consequences, not only for Germany but for\r\nall Europe, and indirectly, for the world.\r\n\r\nGermany (Westphalia) outclasses all other European sources in grades of\r\nmetallurgical coal, in quantities produced, and in cheapness of\r\nproduction. Both France and Belgium must continue to be dependent on\r\nthis source for important parts of the coking coal for metallurgical\r\npurposes, notwithstanding France's acquisition of the Saar Basin, which\r\nproduces mainly non-coking coal, and the development of new reserves in\r\nBelgium. Germany's command of coal is wrecked in several ways. The\r\nFrench take over full and absolute possession of the coal of the Saar\r\nBasin, though Germany has the right to repurchase it at the end of\r\nfifteen years, in case this territory then elects for union with\r\nGermany. The coal of Upper Silesia, with a production of about 23 per\r\ncent of the total of all German hard coal, is to be ceded to Poland,\r\nsubject, however, to plebiscite. Germany undertakes to deliver to France\r\neach year, for not to exceed ten years, an amount of coal equal to the\r\ndifference between the annual pre-war production of the French coal\r\nmines destroyed as a result of the war, and the production of the mines\r\nof the same area during the years in question,--such delivery not to\r\nexceed 20,000,000 tons in any one year of the first five, nor 8,000,000\r\nin any one year of the succeeding five years. In addition, Germany\r\nagrees to deliver coal, or its equivalent in coke, as follows: to France\r\n7,000,000 tons annually for ten years; to Belgium 8,000,000 tons\r\nannually for ten years; to Italy an annual quantity rising by annual\r\nincrements from 4,500,000 tons in 1919-20 to 8,500,000 tons in each of\r\nthe six years 1923-24 to 1928-29; and to Luxemburg, if required, a\r\nquantity of coal equal to the pre-war annual consumption of German coal\r\nin Luxemburg.\r\n\r\nThe total pre-war coal production of Germany in 1913 was 191,500,000\r\ntons. The diminution of production due to loss of territory in\r\nAlsace-Lorraine, in the Saar Basin, and in Upper Silesia amounts to\r\nabout 61,000,000 tons. The further required annual distribution of coal\r\nto France, Italy, Belgium, and Luxemburg amounts to about 40,000,000\r\ntons. This leaves about 90,000,000 tons for Germany's domestic use, as\r\ncompared with a pre-war domestic use of 139,000,000 tons. Even then,\r\nthese calculations make no allowance for coal to be used in export trade\r\nto neutrals or other countries, some part of which seems vital to\r\nGermany's trade. They make no allowance for the deterioration of plant\r\nand machinery in the mines, which will delay resumption of coal\r\nproduction. They make no allowance for the diminution in working hours\r\nand the lack of transportation. In short, unless there is a miraculous\r\nrecovery and development of Germany's coal industry, impossible\r\nconditions have been imposed. Some recognition of this fact appears in\r\nthe great powers to adjust terms which have been vested in the\r\nReparations Committee. Successive revisions of requirements by the\r\nReparations Committee have already reduced the direct contributions of\r\ncoal from Germany nearly fifty per cent. The entire European coal\r\nsituation is in a state of chaos. It was found necessary in 1918 to\r\nappoint a Coal Commission under international control, to attempt to\r\nallocate and distribute supplies. It seems inevitable that the physical\r\nfacts of the situation will prevail, and that the control of the Allies\r\nwill resolve itself into efforts to distribute and coordinate supplies\r\nso as to keep the European machinery going, more or less regardless of\r\nthe terms of the Peace Treaty.\r\n\r\nOne of the important outcomes of this situation has been the recent\r\nrapid development of German lignite production, based on newly\r\nworked-out methods of treatment and utilization.\r\n\r\nBy taking over Alsace-Lorraine, France acquires about 70 per cent of the\r\niron ore reserves and annual production of Germany. This production was\r\nin minor part smelted locally,--the larger part moving down the Rhine to\r\nthe vicinity of the Ruhr coal fields, and Ruhr coal coming back for the\r\nsmelting in Lorraine. This great channel of balanced exchange of\r\ncommodities has been determined by nature, and is not likely to be\r\npermanently affected by political changes. For the time being, however,\r\nthe drawing of a political boundary across this trade route hinders the\r\nfull resumption of the trade. Self-interest will require both Germany\r\nand France to keep these routes open. France requires German coal to\r\nsupply the local smelters near the iron fields, and German markets for\r\nthe excess production of iron ore. On the other hand, Germany's great\r\nsmelting district in the Ruhr Basin is largely dependent on the\r\nLorraine iron ore, and the movement of this iron ore requires coal from\r\ndown the Rhine as a balance.\r\n\r\nThe intelligent handling of this great coal and iron problem is of\r\nfar-reaching consequence to the mineral industries of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing discussion it is not our purpose to argue for any\r\nspecific national or international plan or procedure, but rather to show\r\nsomething of the nature of the problem,--and particularly to show that\r\nintelligent and broadened self-interest requires a definite national\r\npolicy in regard to world mineral questions. Realization of this fact is\r\na long step toward the solution of the international problems. No\r\ngeologist, engineer, or business man is safe, in the normal conduct of\r\nhis affairs, without some attention to these matters.\r\n\r\nIt is our purpose further to bring home the fact that international\r\ncooperation in the mineral field is not merely an academic possibility,\r\nbut that in many important ways it is actually in existence. The terms\r\nof the Peace Treaty alone have far-reaching consequences to the explorer\r\nor mining man in all parts of the world. The modifications of these\r\nterms, which are inevitable in the future, will not be of less\r\nconsequence. It is necessary not only to know what these are, but to aid\r\nin their intelligent formulation.\r\n\r\n\r\nLITERATURE\r\n\r\nA vast new literature on the subject of international mineral relations\r\nhas sprung into existence during and following the war, and anyone may\r\neasily familiarize himself with the essentials of the situation. Some of\r\nthe international features are noted in the discussion of mineral\r\nresources in this book.

The acquirement and mobilization of mineral resources for\r\nmilitary purposes was a vital necessity. In view of the many references\r\nto this application of geology in other parts of this volume, we shall\r\ngo into the subject in this chapter no further than to summarize some of\r\nthe larger results.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence of the war-time breakdown in international commercial\r\nexchange, the actual and potential mineral reserves of nations were more\r\nintensively studied and appraised than ever before, with the view of\r\nmaking nations and belligerent groups self-sustaining. This work\r\ninvolved a comprehensive investigation of the requirements and uses for\r\nminerals, and thus led to a clearer understanding of the human relations\r\nof mineral resources. It required also, almost for the first time, a\r\nrecognition of the nature and magnitude of international movements of\r\nminerals, of the underlying reasons for such movements, and of the vital\r\ninter-relation between domestic and foreign mineral production. The\r\ndomestic mineral industries learned that market requirements are based\r\non ascertainable factors and that they do not just happen. Large new\r\nmineral reserves were developed. Metallurgical practices were adapted to\r\ndomestic supplies, thus adding to available resources. Better ways were\r\nfound to use the products. Some of these developments ceased at the end\r\nof the war, but important advances had been made which were not lost.\r\nOne of the advances of permanent value was the increased attention to\r\nbetter sampling and standardization of mineral products, as a means of\r\ncompetition with standardized foreign products. For instance, the\r\norganization of the Southern Graphite Association made it possible to\r\nguarantee much more uniform supplies from this field, and thereby to\r\ninsure a broader and more stable market. Such movements allow the use\r\nof heterogeneous mineral supplies in a manner which is distinctly\r\nconservational, both in regard to mineral reserves and to the human\r\nenergy factors involved. In another war the possibilities and methods of\r\nmeeting requirements for war minerals will be better understood.\r\n\r\nIn these activities, geologists had a not inconsiderable part. The U. S.\r\nBureau of Mines, the U. S. Geological Survey, state geological surveys,\r\nand many other technical organizations, public and private, turned their\r\nattention to these questions. One of the special developments was the\r\norganization by the Shipping Board of a geologic and engineering\r\ncommittee whose duty it was to study and recommend changes in the\r\nimports and exports of mineral commodities, with a view to releasing\r\nmuch-needed ship tonnage. This committee was also officially connected\r\nwith the War Industries Board and the War Trade Board. It utilized the\r\nexisting government and state mineral organizations in collecting its\r\ninformation. Over a million tons of mineral shipping not necessary for\r\nwar purposes were eliminated. This work involved also a close study of\r\nthe possibilities of domestic production to supply the deficiencies\r\ncaused by reduction of foreign imports.\r\n\r\nOther special geological committees were created for a variety of war\r\npurposes. In the early stages of the war a War Minerals Committee, made\r\nup of representatives of government and state organizations and of the\r\nAmerican Institute of Mining Engineers, made an excellent preliminary\r\nsurvey of mineral conditions. A Joint Mineral Information Board[60] was\r\ncreated at Washington, composed of representatives of more than twenty\r\ngovernment departments which were in one way or another concerned with\r\nminerals. It was surprising, even to those more or less familiar with\r\nthe situation, to find how widely mineral questions ramified through\r\ngovernment departments. For instance, the Department of Agriculture had\r\nmen specially engaged in relation to mineral fertilizers and arsenic.\r\nSulphur and other mineral supplies were occupying the attention of the\r\nWar Department. Mica and other minerals received special attention from\r\nthe Navy Department. The Tariff Board, the Federal Trade Commission, the\r\nCommerce Department, even the Department of State, had men who were\r\nspecializing on certain mineral questions. All these departments had\r\ndelegates on the Joint Mineral Information Board, in which connection\r\nthey met weekly to exchange information for the purpose of getting\r\nbetter coordination and less duplication.\r\n\r\nThe National Academy of Sciences established a geologic committee, with\r\nrepresentatives from the U. S. Geological Survey, the state geological\r\nsurveys, the Geological Society of America, and other organizations.\r\nThis committee did useful work in correlating geological activities,\r\nmainly outside of Washington, and in cooperation with the War Department\r\nkept in touch with the geologic work being done at the front.\r\n\r\nWhile the activities of geologists for government, state, and private\r\norganizations were for the most part in relation to mineral resource\r\nquestions, this was by no means the total contribution. The U. S.\r\nGeological Survey and other organizations, in cooperation with the War\r\nDepartment, did a large amount of topographic and geologic mapping of\r\nthe eastern areas for coast-defense purposes. This work involved\r\nconsideration of the topography for strategic purposes, as well as the\r\nstock-taking of mineral resources--including road materials and water\r\nsupplies. The revision of Geological Survey folios, with these\r\nrequirements in mind, brought results which should be of practical use\r\nin peace time. Studies were likewise made of cantonment areas, with\r\nreference to water supplies and to surface and sub-surface conditions.\r\n\r\nMany geologists were engaged in the military camps at home and abroad,\r\nand in connection with the Student Army Training Corps at the\r\nuniversities, in teaching the elements of map making, map\r\ninterpretation, water supply, rock and soil conditions in relation to\r\ntrenching, and other phases of geology in their relation to military\r\noperations. The textbook on Military Geology,[61] prepared in\r\ncooperation by a dozen or more geologists for use in the courses of the\r\nStudent Army Training Corps, is an admirable text on several phases of\r\napplied geology. The name of the book is perhaps now unfortunate,\r\nbecause most of it is quite as well adapted to peace conditions as to\r\nthose of war. There is no textbook of applied geology which covers\r\ncertain phases of the work in a more effective and modern way. The\r\ntopics treated in this book are rocks, rock weathering, streams, lakes\r\nand swamps, water supply, land forms, map reading and map\r\ninterpretation, and economic relations and economic uses of minerals.\r\nAnother book,[62] on land forms in France, prepared from a physiographic\r\nstandpoint, was a highly useful general survey of topographic features\r\nand was widely used by officers and others.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGY AT THE FRONT[63]\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most spectacular and the best known use of geology in the\r\nwar was at and near the front. This use reached its earliest and highest\r\ndevelopment in the German army, but later was applied effectively by the\r\nBritish and British Colonial armies, and by the American Expeditionary\r\nForce.\r\n\r\nOne of the first intimations to the American public of the use of\r\ngeology at the front appeared in the publication of German censorship\r\nrules in 1918,--when, among the prohibitions, there was one forbidding\r\npublic reference to the use of earth sciences in military operations. A\r\nleading American paper noted this item and speculated at some length\r\neditorially as to what it meant.\r\n\r\nIt was discovered that geologists to the number of perhaps a hundred and\r\nfifty were used by the Germans to prepare and interpret maps of the\r\nfront for the use of officers. Features represented on these maps\r\nincluded topography; the kinds of rocks and their distribution; their\r\nusefulness as road and cement materials; their adaptability for trench\r\ndigging, and the kinds and shapes of trenches possible in the different\r\nrocks; the manner in which material thrown out in trenching would lie\r\nunder weathering; the ground-water conditions, and particularly the\r\ndepth below the surface of the water table at different times of the\r\nyear and in different rocks and soils; the relation of the ground-water\r\nto possibilities of trench digging; water supplies for drinking\r\npurposes; the behavior of the rocks under explosives, and the resistance\r\nof the ground to shell-penetration; the underground geological\r\nconditions bearing on tunnelling and underground mines; and the\r\nelectrical conductivity of rocks of different types, presumably in\r\nconnection with sound-detection devices and groundings of electric\r\ncircuits. Some of the captured German maps were models of applied\r\ngeology. They contained condensed summaries of most of the features\r\nabove named, together with appropriate sketches and sections. During the\r\nArgonne offensive by the American army the captured German lines\r\ndisclosed geologic stations at frequent intervals, each with a full\r\nequipment of maps relating to that part of the front. From these\r\nstations schools of instruction had been conducted for the officers in\r\nthe adjacent parts of the front.\r\n\r\nThe British efforts were along similar lines, although they came late in\r\nthe war, under the leadership of an Australian geologist. Their efforts\r\nwere especially useful in connection with the large amount of tunnelling\r\nand mining done on the British front. Among the many unexpected and\r\nspecial uses of geology might be cited the microscopical identification\r\nof raw materials used in the German cement. It became necessary for\r\ncertain purposes to know where these came from. The microscope disclosed\r\na certain volcanic rock known to be found in only one locality. In the\r\nPalestine campaign, the knowledge of sources of road material and water\r\nsupply based on geologic data was an important element in the advance\r\nover this arid region. Wells were drilled and water pipes laid in\r\naccordance with prearranged plans.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the fact that the usefulness of geology had been clearly\r\nindicated by the experience of the German and British armies, the\r\nAmerican Expeditionary Force was slow to avail itself in large measure\r\nof this tool; but after some delay a geologic service was started on\r\nsomewhat similar lines under the efficient leadership of\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Alfred H. Brooks, Director of the Division of Alaskan\r\nResources in the U. S. Geological Survey. The work was organized in\r\nSeptember, 1917, and during the succeeding ten months included only two\r\nofficers and one clerk. For the last two months preceding the armistice\r\nthere was an average of four geologic officers on the General Staff, in\r\naddition to geologists attached to engineering units engaged in road\r\nbuilding and cement making, and plans had been approved for a\r\nconsiderable enlargement of the geologic force. The work was devoted to\r\nthe collection and presentation of geologic data relating to (1) field\r\nworks; (2) water supply; and (3) road material. Of these the first two\r\nreceived the most attention. Maps were prepared, based somewhat on the\r\nGerman model, for the French defenses of the Vosges and Lorraine\r\nsectors, and for the German defenses of the St. Mihiel, Pont-a-Mousson,\r\nand Vosges sectors. Water supply reports covered nearly 15,000 square\r\nkilometers. The following description of the formations, taken from the\r\nlegend of one of the geologic maps, shows the nature of the data\r\ncollected:\r\n\r\n     _Silt, clay and mud, with some limestone gravel_, usually more\r\n     or less saturated, except during dry season (June to\r\n     September), in many places subject to flooding. Surface\r\n     usually soft except during Summer. These deposits are 1/2 to 2\r\n     meters thick in the small valleys, and 2 to 3 meters in the\r\n     ---- Valleys. Unfavorable to all field works on account of\r\n     ground-water and floods, and not thick enough for cave\r\n     shelters.\r\n\r\n     _Silts with some clay and fine sands and locally some fine\r\n     gravel and rock debris._ These deposits occur principally on\r\n     summits and slopes, and are probably from 1 to 2 meters thick.\r\n     Even during dry season (June to September) they retain\r\n     moisture and afford rather soft ground. In wet season the\r\n     formation is very soft and often muddy. In many places water\r\n     occurs along bottom of these deposits. Favorable for trenches,\r\n     but which require complete revetment, and ample provision for\r\n     drainage, not thick enough for cave shelters; cut and cover\r\n     most practical type of shelter.\r\n\r\n     _Clay at surface with clay shales below._ This deposit occurs\r\n     in flats and is usually saturated for a depth of 1 to 2-1/2\r\n     meters, during wet season, for most of the year the surface is\r\n     soft, but in part dries out in Summer. Deep trenches usually\r\n     impossible, and even shallow trenches likely to be filled with\r\n     water; defensive works will be principally parapets revetted\r\n     on both sides. Cave shelter construction usually\r\n     impracticable, unless means be provided for sinking through\r\n     saturated surface zone into the dry ground underneath. Cut and\r\n     cover usually the most practical type of shelter in this\r\n     formation.\r\n\r\n     _Clay at surface with calcareous clay shale and some thin\r\n     limestone layers below._ This formation occurs in low rounded\r\n     hills; surface saturated during wet weather, but terrain\r\n     permits of natural drainage, and dries out during Summer;\r\n     during wet season (October to May) the surface zone is more or\r\n     less saturated, and ground may be muddy to a depth of a meter\r\n     or more, ground-water level usually within two or three meters\r\n     of surface. Trench construction easy, but requires complete\r\n     revetment, and ample provision for surface drainage. Cave\r\n     shelters can be constructed in this formation where the slope\r\n     is sufficient to permit of drainage tunnels. The depth to\r\n     ground-water level should always be determined by test shafts\r\n     or bore holes in advance of dugout construction.\r\n\r\n     _Surface formation usually clay 1 to 2 meters in depth; below\r\n     this is soft clay shales or soft limestone._ Surface usually\r\n     fairly well drained, and fairly hard ground. In general,\r\n     favorable for trenches and locally favorable for cave\r\n     shelters. In some localities underground water prevents cave\r\n     shelter construction. The presence or absence of underground\r\n     water should always be determined by test shafts or bore holes\r\n     in advance of dugout construction.\r\n\r\n     _Surface formation consisting of weathered zone 1/2 to 1-1/2\r\n     meters thick, made up of clay with limestone fragments and\r\n     broken rock. Below is compact limestone formation._ The\r\n     surface of this formation is usually fairly hard, and well\r\n     drained except in wettest season. Trenches built in it require\r\n     little revetting; very favorable for cave shelters, but\r\n     requires hard rock excavation. Some thin beds of clay occur in\r\n     some of the limestone, and at these a water bearing horizon\r\n     will be found. Where a limestone formation rests on clay as\r\n     near ---- a line of springs or seepages is usually found. Such\r\n     localities should be avoided, or the field works placed above\r\n     the line of springs or seepages. This formation is best\r\n     developed in the plateau west of ----. Here it is covered by\r\n     only a thin layer of soil, hard rock being close to the\r\n     surface.\r\n\r\n     The limestones afford the only rock within the quadrangle\r\n     which can be used for road metal.\r\n\r\n     _Quarries_ (in part abandoned).\r\n\r\n     _Limestone gravel pits._\r\n\r\n     _Locus of springs and seepages._ These should be avoided as\r\n     far as possible in the location of field works, especially of\r\n     dugouts. Field works should be placed above the lines of\r\n     springs.\r\n\r\nThe water supply maps with accompanying engineer field notes are models\r\nof concise description of water supply conditions, with specific\r\ndirections for procedure under different conditions. A few paragraphs\r\ntaken from these notes are as follows:\r\n\r\n     Ground overlying rock, such as limestone, compact sandstone,\r\n     granites, etc., which are usually fractured, is from the\r\n     standpoint of underground water, most favorable for siting of\r\n     field works. Clay shales and clay hold both surface and\r\n     underground water, and are, therefore, unfavorable for field\r\n     works. The contact between hard rocks resting on clay or clay\r\n     shales is almost invariably water bearing, and should be\r\n     avoided in locating field works.\r\n\r\n     At localities where impervious formations (clay, etc.) occur\r\n     at or near the surface, they hold the water and form a\r\n     superficial zone of saturation. This condition makes trench\r\n     construction and maintenance difficult, and cave shelters can\r\n     usually only be made by providing means of sinking through the\r\n     saturated zone. The surface saturated zone often dries out in\r\n     summer.\r\n\r\n     In pervious, or almost pervious rocks, the zone of saturation,\r\n     or ground-water level, lies at much lower depth, and may\r\n     permit of the construction of field works as well as cave\r\n     shelters above it.\r\n\r\n     Underground water bearing horizons and water bearing faults\r\n     should be avoided in locating field works.\r\n\r\n     Wherever there is any uncertainty about the underground water\r\n     conditions, test shafts or bore holes should always be made in\r\n     advance of the construction of extensive deep works.\r\n\r\n\r\nEFFECT OF THE WAR ON THE SCIENCE OF ECONOMIC GEOLOGY\r\n\r\nIn general, the war required an intensive application of geology along\r\nlines already pretty well established under peace conditions. Much was\r\ndone to make the application more direct and effective, and a vast\r\namount of geologic information was mobilized. The general result was a\r\nquickened appreciation of the possibilities of the use of geology for\r\npractical purposes. Perhaps the most important single result was a wider\r\nrecognition of the real relations of mineral resources to human\r\nactivities, and of the international phases of the problem. More\r\nspecifically, there was a most careful stock-taking of mineral resources\r\nand a consideration of the \"why\" of their commercial use. Many new\r\nresources were found, as well as new ways to utilize them.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[60] Now known as Economic Liaison Committee.\r\n\r\n[61] _Military geology and topography_, Herbert E.

S. Geol. Survey_, 1920.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nGEOLOGY AND ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nEconomic applications of geology are by no means confined to mineral\r\nresources (including water and soils). The earth is used by the human\r\nrace in many other ways. Human habitations and constructions rest on it\r\nand penetrate it. It is the basis for transportation, both by land and\r\nwater. Its water powers are used. In these various relations the\r\napplications of geology are too numerous to classify, much less to\r\ndescribe. While only a few of these activities have in the past required\r\nthe participation of geologists, the growing size of the operations and\r\nincreasing efficiency in their planning and execution are multiplying\r\nthe calls for geologic advice. The nature of such applications of\r\ngeology may be briefly indicated.[64]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOUNDATIONS\r\n\r\nThe foundations of modern structures such as heavy buildings, especially\r\nin untried localities, require much more careful consideration of the\r\nsubstrata than was necessary for lighter structures. In planning such\r\nfoundations, it is necessary to know the kinds of rocks to be excavated,\r\ntheir supporting strength, their structures, the difficulties which are\r\nlikely to be caused by water, and other geologic features. Failure to\r\ngive proper attention to these factors has led to some disastrous\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nThe planning of foundations and abutments of bridges requires similar\r\ngeologic knowledge. In addition, there must be considered certain\r\nphysiographic factors affecting the nature and variation of stream flow\r\nand the migration of shore lines.\r\n\r\n\r\nSURFACE WATERS\r\n\r\nConstruction of great modern dams is preceded by a careful analysis of\r\nsub-surface conditions, in regard to both the rocks and the water. It is\r\nnecessary to know the supporting strength of the rocks in relation to\r\nthe weight of the dam; to know whether the rocks will allow leakage\r\naround or beneath the dam; and to know whether there are any zones of\r\nweakness in the rocks which will allow shearing of foundations under the\r\nweight of the dam in combination with the pressure of the ponded water.\r\nIt is necessary to know whether the valley is a rock valley or whether\r\nit is partially filled with rock debris; if the latter, how deep this\r\ndebris is, and its behavior under load and in a saturated condition.\r\nHere again physiographic factors are of vital importance, both in\r\nrelation to the history of development of the valley, and to questions\r\nof stream flow and reservoir storage.[65]\r\n\r\nConstruction of dams is only an item in the long list of engineering\r\nactivities related to surface waters. River and harbor improvements of a\r\nvast range likewise involve geologic factors. Problems of wave action,\r\nshore currents, shifting of shores, erosion, and sedimentation, which\r\nare of great importance in such operations, have long occupied the\r\nattention of the geologist. They belong especially in the branch of the\r\nscience known as physiography.\r\n\r\nGeology in relation to underground water supplies is discussed in\r\nChapter V.\r\n\r\n\r\nTUNNELS\r\n\r\nThe digging of tunnels for transportation purposes, for aqueducts, and\r\nfor sewage disposal requires careful analysis of geologic conditions in\r\nregard to both the rocks and the underground water. Knowledge of these\r\nconditions is necessary in planning the work, in inviting bids, and in\r\nmaking bids. It is necessary during the progress of the work. Too often\r\nin the past disastrous consequences, both physical and financial, have\r\nresulted from lack of consideration of elemental geologic conditions.\r\n\r\nThe building of the great New York aqueducts and subways through highly\r\ncomplex crystalline rocks has been under the closest geological advice\r\nand supervision. The detailed study of the geology of Manhattan Island\r\nthrough a long series of years has resulted in an understanding of the\r\nrocks and their structures which has been of great practical use. In the\r\naqueduct construction the kinds of rock to be encountered in the\r\ndifferent sections, their water content, their hardness, their joints\r\nand faults, were all platted and planned for, and actual excavation\r\nproved the accuracy of the forecasts. An interesting phase of this work\r\nwas the tunneling under the Hudson at points where the pre-glacial rock\r\nchannel was buried to a depth of nearly a thousand feet by glacial and\r\nriver deposits,--this work requiring a close study of the physiographic\r\nhistory of the river.\r\n\r\n\r\nSLIDES\r\n\r\nSlides of earth and rock materials, both of the creeping and sudden\r\ntypes, have often been regarded as acts of Providence,--but studies of\r\nthe geologic factors have in many cases disclosed preventable causes. A\r\nconsiderable geologic literature has sprung up with reference to rock\r\nslides, which is of practical use in excavation work of many kinds.\r\n\r\nThe cause of such movements is gravity. The softer, unconsolidated rock\r\nmaterials yield of course more readily than the harder ones, but even\r\nstrong rocks are often unable to withstand the pull of gravity. The\r\nrelative weakness of rock masses on a large scale was graphically shown\r\nby Chamberlin and Salisbury,[66] in a calculation indicating that a mass\r\nof average hard rock a mile thick, domed to the curvature of the earth,\r\ncan support a layer of only about ten feet of its own material. The\r\nstructural geologist, through his study of folds, faults, and rock\r\nflowage, comes to regard rocks essentially as failing structures.\r\n\r\nDisturbances of equilibrium, resulting in rock movements under gravity,\r\nmay be caused by local loading, either natural or artificial. Natural\r\nloading may be due to unusual rainfall, or raising of water level, or\r\nincreased barometric pressure. Artificial loading may come from\r\nconstruction of heavy buildings or dams. Movement may also result from\r\nexcavation, which takes away lateral support--and such excavation again\r\nmay be caused by natural processes of erosion or by artificial processes\r\ninvolved in construction. Movement may be caused by mere change in the\r\nmoisture content of rocks, or by alterations of their mineral and\r\nchemical character, affecting their resistance to gravity. In still\r\nother cases, earthquakes are the initiating cause of movement.\r\n\r\nIn unconsolidated rocks, a frequent cause of movement is the presence of\r\nwet and slippery clay layers. The identification and draining of these\r\nclay layers may eliminate this cause. In certain sands, on the other\r\nhand, water may actually act as a cement and tend to increase the\r\nstrength of the rock. Planes of weakness in the rock, such as bedding,\r\njoints, and cleavage, are also likely to localize movement.\r\n\r\nEarth materials, and even fairly hard rocks, may creep under gravity at\r\nan astonishingly low angle. The angle from the horizontal at which loose\r\nmaterial will stand on a horizontal base without sliding is called the\r\nangle of rest or repose. It is often between 30 deg. and 35 deg., but there is\r\nwide variation from this figure, depending on the shapes and sizes of\r\nthe particles and on other conditions. It has been suggested that even\r\nthe slight differences in elevation of continents and sea bottoms may,\r\nduring long geologic eras, have caused a creep of continental masses in\r\na seaward direction.\r\n\r\nIn problems relating to slides, the geologist is concerned in\r\ndetermining the kinds of rocks, their space relations, their structures\r\nand textures, their metamorphic changes, their water content and the\r\nnature of the water movement, their strength, both under tension and\r\ncompression, and other factors.\r\n\r\nIn the digging of the Panama Canal, a geological staff was employed in\r\nthe study of the rock and earth formations to be met. However, had more\r\nattention been paid to geologic questions in the planning stages, this\r\ngreat undertaking, so thoroughly worked out from a purely engineering\r\nstandpoint, would have avoided certain mistakes due to lack of\r\nunderstanding of the geological conditions. It is a curious fact that in\r\nthese early stages no strength tests of rocks were made, and that no\r\nthorough detailed study was made of the geologic factors affecting\r\nslides and their prevention. It was only after the slides had become\r\nserious that the geological aspects of the subject were intensively\r\nconsidered. The results of the geologic study, therefore, are useful\r\nonly for preventive measures for the future and for other undertakings.\r\nOne of the interesting features of this investigation was the discovery\r\nthat certain soft rock formations were rendered weaker rather than\r\nstronger by the draining off of the water. It had been more or less\r\nassumed that the water had acted as a lubricant rather than as a cement.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBSIDENCE\r\n\r\nNot the least important application of geology to slides is in relation\r\nto deep mining operations. While the mining geologist has been\r\nprincipally engaged in exploration and development of ores, he is now\r\nbeginning to be called in to interpret the great earth movements caused\r\nby the sinking of the ground over mining openings. For instance, the\r\nlong-wall method of coal mining has resulted in a slow progressive\r\nsubsidence of the overlying rock, affecting overlying mineral beds and\r\nsurface structures over great areas. Detailed studies have been made of\r\nthis movement, in order to ascertain its relation to the strength and\r\nstructure of the rocks, its relation to the nature of the excavation,\r\nits speed of transmission, and the possible methods of prevention.\r\nGerman scientists have perhaps gone further with this kind of study than\r\nanyone else. In an elaborate investigation of subsidence over a coal\r\nmine in Illinois,[67] unusually complete data were obtained as to the\r\nnature, direction, and speed of the transmission of strains through\r\nlarge rock masses, and as to their effect in producing secondary rock\r\nstructures.\r\n\r\n\r\nRAILWAY BUILDING\r\n\r\nIn railway building, the planning and estimation of cuts and fills is\r\nnow receiving geologic consideration, in order to make sure that no\r\ngeologic condition has been overlooked which will affect costs, the\r\nstability of the road, or the accurate formulation of contracts. The\r\nlocation of best sources of supply for ballast is also a geologic\r\nproblem (see pp. 90-91).\r\n\r\nThe physiographic phases of geology also are finding important\r\napplications to railroad building. The physiographer studies the surface\r\nforms with a trained eye, which sees them not as lawless or\r\nheterogeneous units but as parts of a topographic system, and he is able\r\nto eliminate much unnecessary work in the location of trial routes.\r\nFurther study of some of the older railroads from this standpoint has\r\nled to considerable improvements. Physiographic study has also been\r\napplied to railway bridge construction, in the appraisal of the\r\ndifficulties in surmounting stream barriers. A still broader use of\r\nphysiography or geography, not popularly understood, is illustrated in\r\nthe case of certain transcontinental railroads, in the study of the\r\nprobable future development of the territory to be served--many features\r\nof which can be predicted with some accuracy from a study of the rocks,\r\nsoils, topography, conditions of transportation, and natural conditions\r\nfavoring localization of cities. The location of new towns in some cases\r\nhas been based on this kind of preliminary study.\r\n\r\nIn locating an Alaskan railway close to the end of a momentarily\r\nquiescent glacier, troubles were not long in appearing, due to the fact\r\nthat the glacier was really not as stable as it seemed to the layman. A\r\nspecialist on glaciers, knowing their behavior, their relations to\r\nprecipitation, their relations to earthquakes, the speed of their\r\nmovement, and the periodicity of their movement, was ultimately called\r\ninto consultation on the location of the railroad.\r\n\r\n\r\nROAD BUILDING\r\n\r\nRoad building in recent years has become a stupendous engineering\r\nundertaking, which is requiring geologic aid to locate nearby sources of\r\nsupply for road materials. A considerable number of geologists are now\r\ndevoting their attention to this work. It relates not only to the\r\nhard-rock geology but to the gravel and surface geology. Certain\r\nnorthern states are using specialists in glacial geology to aid in\r\nlocating proper supplies of sand and gravel.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGY IN ENGINEERING COURSES\r\n\r\nMany engineering courses include elementary geologic studies, in\r\nrecognition of the close relationship between geology and engineering.\r\nMen so trained, though not geologists, have been responsible for many\r\napplications of geology to engineering. With the increasing size and\r\nimportance of operations, calling for more specialization, the\r\nprofessional geologist is now being called in to a larger extent than\r\nformerly. A logical trend also is the acquirement of more engineering\r\ntraining on the part of the geologist, for the purpose of pursuing these\r\napplications of his science.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[64] Excellent texts on this subject may be found in _Military Geology\r\nand Topography_, Herbert E.

There are as many different\r\nkinds of training as there are institutions in which geology is taught.\r\nWithin an institution, also, it is seldom that any two persons take\r\nexactly the same groups of geologic studies. This situation allows wide\r\nlatitude of training to meet ever changing requirements, but in other\r\nrespects it is not so desirable.\r\n\r\n\r\nPURE VERSUS APPLIED SCIENCE\r\n\r\nIn no institution are all the applied branches of geology taught. There\r\nis constant pressure for the introduction of more applied courses; this\r\nseems to be the tendency of the times. The economic geologist, fresh\r\nfrom vivid experiences in his special field, is often insistent that a\r\nnew course be introduced to cover his particular specialty. Any attempt,\r\nhowever, to put into a college course a considerable fraction of the\r\napplied phases of geology would mean the crowding out of more essential\r\nbasic studies. To yield wholly to such pressure would in fact soon\r\ndevelop an impossible situation; for, on the basis of time alone, it\r\nwould be quite impossible to give courses on all of the applied subjects\r\nin a training period of reasonable length.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the failure to introduce a fair proportion of applied\r\ngeology, on the ground that the function of the college is to teach pure\r\nscience and that in some way economic applications are non-scientific,\r\nseems to the writer an equally objectionable procedure,--because it does\r\nnot take into account the unavoidable human relations of the science,\r\nwhich vivify and give point and direction to scientific work. The\r\ndevelopment of science in economic directions does not necessarily mean\r\nincursion into less scientific or non-scientific fields. It is true\r\nthat many of the economic applications of geology are so new and so\r\nconstantly changing that they are not yet fully organized on a\r\nscientific basis; but this fact is merely an indication of the lag of\r\nscience, and not of the absence of possibilities of developing science\r\nin such directions. There is today a considerable tendency among\r\ngeologists of an academic type, whose lives have been spent in purely\r\nscientific investigation and teaching, to assume that anything different\r\nfrom the field of their activities is in some manner non-scientific, and\r\ntherefore less worthy. Many economic geologists have been made to feel\r\nthis criticism, even though seldom expressed openly. For the good of\r\ngeologic science, this tendency seems to the writer extremely\r\nunfortunate. The young man entering the field of economic geology should\r\nbe made to understand that his is the highest scientific opportunity;\r\nand that if parts of his field are not yet fully organized, the greater\r\nis his own opportunity to participate in the constructive work to be\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nUnder war requirements many geologists were called upon to extend their\r\nefforts to bordering fields of endeavor. In some quarters these\r\nactivities were regarded as non-scientific, and as subtracting from\r\nefficiency in purely geological work,--and yet out of this combined\r\neffort came a wider comprehension of new scientific fields, between the\r\nestablished sciences and between sciences and human needs. It is\r\ninevitable that in the future these fields, now imperfectly charted,\r\nwill be occupied and developed, perhaps not by the men who are already\r\nwell established in their particular fields of endeavor, but by coming\r\nscientists. In this light, it was a privilege for geologists to\r\nparticipate in the discovery and charting activities of the war.\r\n\r\nStill another attempt to discriminate between scientific and\r\nnon-scientific phases of geologic effort has been the assumption by\r\ncertain scientific organizations with reference to standards of\r\nadmission,--that work done for practical purposes may be regarded as\r\nscientific only if it leads to advancement of the science through the\r\npublication of the results. There is by no means any general agreement\r\nas to the validity of this distinction. On this basis, some of the most\r\neffective scientific work which is translated directly into use for the\r\nbenefit of civilization is ruled out as science, because it is\r\nexpressed on a typewritten rather than on a printed page.\r\n\r\nWhile applied phases of the geologist's work may be truly scientific in\r\nthe broader sense, it is undoubtedly easy in this field to drift into\r\nempirical methods, and to emphasize facility and skill at the expense of\r\noriginal scientific thought. The practice of geology then becomes an art\r\nrather than a science. This remark is pertinent also to much of\r\nnon-applied geologic work in recent years. A considerable proportion of\r\nthis empirical facility is desirable and necessary in the routine\r\ncollection of data and in their description; but where, as is often the\r\ncase, the geologist's absorption in such work minimizes the use of his\r\nconstructive faculties, it does not aid greatly in the advancement of\r\nscience.\r\n\r\nGeology is by no means the only science in which there has been\r\ncontroversy as to the relative merits of the so-called pure and applied\r\nphases; but as one of the youngest sciences, which heretofore has been\r\npursued mainly from the standpoint of \"pure science,\" it is now, perhaps\r\nmore than any other science, in the transition stage to a wider\r\nviewpoint. In the past there was doubt about the extension of chemistry\r\ntoward the fields of physics and engineering, and of physics toward the\r\nfields of chemistry and engineering, and of both physics and chemistry\r\ntoward purely economic applications; but out of these fields have grown\r\nthe great sciences of physical chemistry, chemical engineering, and\r\nothers,--and few would be rash enough to attempt to draw a line between\r\nthe pure and applied science, or between the scientific and\r\nnon-scientific phases of this work. This general tendency means a\r\nbroadening of science and not its deterioration.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOURSE OF STUDY SUGGESTED\r\n\r\nThere are almost as many opinions on desirable training for economic\r\ngeology as there are geologists, and the writer's view cannot be taken\r\nas representing any widely accepted standard. On the basis of his own\r\nexperience, however, both in teaching and in field practice, he would\r\nlay emphasis on the fundamental branches both of geology and of the\r\nallied sciences,--general geology, stratigraphy, paleontology,\r\nphysiography, sedimentation, mineralogy, petrology, structural and\r\nmetamorphic geology, physics, chemistry, mathematics, and biology.\r\nAfter these are covered, as much attention should be given to economic\r\napplications as time permits. The time allowance for training, at a\r\nmaximum, is not sufficient to cover both pure and applied science.\r\nSubsequent experience will supply the deficiencies in applied knowledge,\r\nbut will not make up for lack of study of basic principles.\r\n\r\nIt is safe advice to a student wishing to prepare for economic geology\r\nthat there is no royal road to success; that his best chance lies in the\r\neffort to make himself a scientist, even though he cover only a narrow\r\nfield; that if he is successful in this, opportunities for economic\r\napplications will almost inevitably follow. To devote attention from the\r\nstart merely to practical and commercial features, rather than to\r\nscientific principles, brings the student at once into competition with\r\nmining engineers, business men, accountants, and others, who are often\r\nable to handle the purely empirical features of an economic or practical\r\nkind better than the geologist. In the long run the economic geologist\r\nsucceeds because he knows the fundamentals of his science, and not\r\nbecause he has mere facility in the empirical economic phases of his\r\nwork. Of course there are exceptions to this statement,--there are men\r\nwith a highly developed business sense who are successful in spite of\r\ninadequate scientific training, but such success should be regarded as a\r\nbusiness and not a professional success.\r\n\r\nGeology is sometimes described as the application of other sciences to\r\nthe earth. This statement might be made even broader, and geology\r\ndescribed as the application of all knowledge to the earth. In the\r\nwriter's experience, the best results on the whole have been obtained\r\nfrom students who, before entering geology, have had a broad general\r\neducation or have followed intensively some other line of study. Whether\r\nthis study has been the ancient languages, law, engineering, economics,\r\nor other sciences, the results have usually been good if the early\r\ntraining has been sound. To start in geology without some such\r\nbackground, and without the resulting power of a well-trained mind, is\r\nto start with a handicap in the long race to the highest professional\r\nsuccess. It follows, then, that intensive study of geology should in\r\nmost cases not begin until late in the undergraduate course, and\r\npreferably not until the graduate years. Two or three years of graduate\r\nwork may then suffice to launch the geologist on his career, but so\r\ngreat is the field, and so rapid the growth of knowledge within it, that\r\nthere is no termination to his study. It is not enough to settle back\r\ncomfortably on empirical practice based solely on previously acquired\r\nknowledge. Each problem develops new scientific aspects. It is this ever\r\nrenewing interest which is one of the great charms of the science.\r\n\r\nHowever, whether the student has a general training in geology, a\r\nspecialized knowledge of certain branches, or takes it up incidentally\r\nin connection with engineering and other sciences, he will find\r\nopportunities for economic applications. The frequent success of the\r\nmining engineer in the geological phases of his work is an indication\r\nthat even a comparatively small amount of geological knowledge is\r\nuseful.\r\n\r\nThe writer is inclined to emphasize also the desirability of what might\r\nbe called the quantitative approach to the subject,--that is, of\r\ntraining in mathematics and laboratory practice, which gives the student\r\nfacility in treating geologic problems concretely and in quantitative\r\nterms. Geology is passing from the descriptive and qualitative stages to\r\na more precise basis. For this reason the combination of geology with\r\nengineering often proves a desirable one. It is not uncommon for the\r\nstudent trained solely in the humanities and other non-quantitative\r\nsubjects to have difficulty in acquiring habits of mind which lead to\r\nsufficient precision in the application of his science. He may have a\r\ngood grasp of general principles and be able to express himself well,\r\nbut he is handicapped in securing definite results. This does not\r\nnecessarily mean that a large amount of time should be given to study of\r\nquantitative methods; exact habit of mind is more important in the early\r\nstages than expert facility with methods.\r\n\r\nThe teacher of economic geology finds his data so voluminous that it is\r\ndifficult to present all the essential facts and yet leave sufficient\r\ntime for discussion of general principles or for drill in their\r\nconstructive application. It is difficult to lay down any rule as a\r\nguide to the proper division of effort; but from the writer's point of\r\nview, it is a mistake to attempt to crowd into a course too many facts.\r\nAt best they cannot all be given; and in the attempt to do so, the\r\nstudent is brought into a passive and receptive attitude, requiring\r\nmaximum use of his memory and minimum use of his reasoning power.\r\nPresentation of a few fundamental facts, combined with vigorous\r\ndiscussion tending to develop the student's ability to use these facts,\r\nand particularly tending to develop a constructive habit of\r\ninvestigation, seems to be the most profitable use of time during the\r\ncourse of training. The acquirement of facts and details will come fast\r\nenough in actual practice.\r\n\r\nThe variety, amount, and complexity of the data available in geology\r\ntend in themselves toward generalizations in teaching--toward the\r\ndeductive rather than the inductive method. A certain amount of\r\ngeneralization is desirable, but its over-emphasis develops bad habits\r\nof mind on the part of the student, and requires radical readjustment of\r\nhis ideas in subsequent field investigations. To retain a proper\r\nemphasis on inductive methods, it is necessary to limit the amount of\r\ndata presented. Good results have been obtained by using the \"case\r\nsystem,\" now common in the teaching of law--that is, by starting with a\r\nspecific fact or situation as a basis for developing principles.\r\n\r\nAnother advantage in the restriction of data is the opportunity thus\r\nafforded for spending more time in the study of original reports rather\r\nthan of the short textbook summaries. The student thus learns where the\r\nbest primary sources of information are, how to find them, and how to\r\nextract essentials from them.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIELD WORK\r\n\r\nField work is an essential part of any course of geologic training. Not\r\nonly should it be taken at every opportunity during the regular school\r\nyear, but no summer should be allowed to pass without geologic practice\r\nin the field. Opportunities for such work are offered in the summer\r\nfield courses given by various institutions. In recent years it has\r\nusually been possible, also, for the student with elementary training to\r\ntake part in summer geological survey work for state, national, or\r\nprivate organizations. In fact, after two or three years of geologic\r\ntraining, it is comparatively easy for the student to earn at such\r\nintervals during the year a fair fraction of his year's expenses.\r\n\r\nThe ideal arrangement, from the writer's viewpoint, would be about an\r\nequal division of time between indoor and outdoor study. The\r\nalternation from one to the other supplies a much needed corrective to\r\nclear thinking. It is impossible to bring all the subject materials into\r\nthe classroom and laboratory; such study must inevitably be more or less\r\ndeductive and generalized. If the student at frequent intervals is not\r\nable to acquire and renew a mental picture of field conditions, there is\r\nlikely to be a faulty perspective even in regard to principles, and a\r\nconsiderable gap between the theoretical and applied phases of his\r\nknowledge. It may be possible in the classroom, for instance, to discuss\r\nfaults in great detail with the aid of maps, diagrams, and pictures; and\r\nyet it is extremely difficult to get a real three-dimensional conception\r\nof the problems without actually standing on the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIALIZATION IN STUDIES\r\n\r\nWith the increasing size and efficiency of human operations has come an\r\ninevitable tendency to specialization. Where, in the past, the necessary\r\ngeologic work might be passably done by the mining engineer, the local\r\nsuperintendent or operator, it is now being intrusted to specialists.\r\nEven within the more strictly engineering phases of the mining\r\nengineer's work, there is the same tendency toward specialization; his\r\nwork is being divided up among the electrical engineers, the mechanical\r\nengineers, the hydraulic engineers, and others. The opportunities for\r\ngeologic work, therefore, are distinctly in the direction of\r\nspecialization. The student in determining the field he shall enter\r\nneeds to take this fact into account and to prepare accordingly, but not\r\nat the sacrifice of the broad basal training. Only a small part of the\r\nspecialization can be accomplished in college. The remainder will come\r\nwith experience.\r\n\r\nIn the future there is likely to be increasing specialization among the\r\ndifferent educational institutions in the phases of applied geology\r\nwhich are taught. Geographic location has a good deal to do with this\r\ntendency. Where an institution is located near a coal or oil field, it\r\nis likely, as a matter of course, to specialize to some extent in the\r\napplication of geology to these resources. Or, the specialization may\r\narise from the fact that the teachers have had special training in\r\ncertain phases of applied geology, and such training naturally and\r\nproperly determines the emphasis to be placed. Courses in engineering\r\ngeology are finding a natural development in the leading engineering\r\ncolleges.\r\n\r\nIn view of the fact that it is impossible for any one institution to\r\ncover all phases of applied geology, because of lack of time, and in\r\nview of the fact that even if this were attempted the results would be\r\nvery unequal, because of the varied experience of teachers or because of\r\ngeographic location, it would seem wise definitely to recognize these\r\nlimitations and for each institution to play up the work it can do best.\r\nWith freedom of migration among universities, a student by moving from\r\nplace to place can thus secure any combination of specialized courses\r\nwhich best fits his requirements.\r\n\r\n\r\nA DEGREE OF ECONOMIC GEOLOGY\r\n\r\nThere has been some agitation in recent years for standardization of\r\ncourses in economic geology, and for the granting of a special degree in\r\nevidence of the completion of such a course. The principal argument for\r\nthis procedure is that it would tend to insure a better average of\r\ntraining and would draw a line between worthy geologists and a host of\r\nill-trained pseudo-geologists. The earth is so accessible, and its use\r\nso varied, that geology is handicapped perhaps more than any other\r\nscience by persons who really have no valid claim to a scientific title.\r\n\r\nThe writer doubts whether a special degree in economic geology would go\r\nfar toward improving this situation. Even if the courses were the same\r\nin different institutions, the manner of treatment and the ability of\r\nthe teachers would be so varied that in the future, as in the past,\r\nanyone inquiring into the real standing of a geologist would be likely\r\nto consider his individual training rather than the degree attached to\r\nhis name. There would be no guarantee that institutions not qualified to\r\ngive the degree might not do so. However, the principal objection in the\r\nwriter's mind to a degree of economic geology is the assumption that it\r\nis possible for anybody, in the present stage of knowledge, to formulate\r\na standardized course adequate or best to meet the varied requirements.\r\nConsidering the breadth and the variety of the field, any such attempt\r\nat standardization would have to be highly arbitrary. Once established,\r\nit would be a hindrance to the natural development of new courses to\r\nmeet the ever changing requirements. When, if ever, the science of\r\neconomic geology becomes fully organized, a standardized course may be\r\npossible. In the present stage of the science, more elasticity is\r\nrequired than seems to be possible in any of the courses proposed.\r\n\r\nOne of the purposes of the introduction of a degree of economic geology,\r\nto separate the sheep from the goats, may be accomplished in another\r\nway,--namely, by the establishment and maintenance of high standards of\r\nadmission and high aims on the part of the various professional\r\nsocieties having to do with geology and mining. If this is done,\r\nmembership in such societies may be regarded as evidence of sound\r\ntraining and achievement. To some extent this procedure may relieve the\r\npressure on universities for uniformity of courses and degrees, leaving\r\nthem free to develop in such manner as seems best. Scientific\r\norganizations, overlooking the entire field, are in a position to take\r\ninto account the greatest variety of factors of training and experience\r\nin selecting their members. Failure of any university course to make men\r\neligible for such recognition will obviously react on the course in a\r\ndesirable way.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OPPORTUNITIES OF THE ECONOMIC GEOLOGIST\r\n\r\nIt has been the aim in this book to present a general view of the fields\r\nof activity of the economic geologist; and the list of chapter headings\r\nin itself summarizes the variety of his opportunities. The rapidly\r\nincreasing use of earth materials promises far greater calls for\r\ngeologic aid in the future than in the past. The profession is in its\r\ninfancy.\r\n\r\nOpportunities for employment are ordinarily found in three main\r\ndirections--in educational institutions, in the federal and state\r\ngeological surveys, and in private organizations. Connection with the\r\nUnited States Geological Survey excludes participation in private work,\r\nand in recent years even in teaching. In the state surveys there is\r\nordinarily more latitude in this regard. In the educational\r\ninstitutions, it is rather the common procedure for the instructor to\r\nsecure his field practice and experience through private agencies, or\r\nthrough part time connection with state surveys,--an arrangement with\r\nadvantages to all concerned. The educational institution secures the\r\nbenefit of the field experience which it cannot afford to provide, and\r\nis enabled to hold geologists at salaries far below their earning\r\ncapacity. The geologist gains by the opportunity to alternate between\r\noffice and field study, and to correct his perspective by the constant\r\nchecking of theory with field conditions. The combination tends to keep\r\nthe clearly scientific and the applied phases in a proper relative\r\nproportion; it minimizes the danger of drifting into purely empirical\r\nfield methods on the one hand, and of losing touch with actualities on\r\nthe other. Geologists devoting their attention solely to field work\r\noften complain that they do not have time to digest and correlate their\r\nresults, nor to keep up with what others are doing. On the other hand,\r\ngeologists without current field practice are likely to develop too\r\nstrongly along subjective, deductive, and theoretical lines. The teacher\r\ngains in freshness and force in the presentation of his subject in the\r\nclassroom, and the very effort necessary for presentation requires\r\nbetter analysis and coordination of his field observations. The private\r\nor state organization gains in this combination by drawing on the\r\ngeneral and varied knowledge which has necessarily been accumulated for\r\nteaching and investigative purposes.\r\n\r\nTemperament and circumstances will determine in which of these\r\ndirections the student will turn. However, in view of the present\r\nnatural tendency to be attracted by the large financial rewards in the\r\ncommercial field, it may not be out of place to emphasize the fact that\r\nthese rewards are perhaps more likely to be gained through perfected\r\ntraining and experience in state and national surveys and in educational\r\ninstitutions, than through early concentration in the commercial field.\r\nIn any case, the financial side will take care of itself when sufficient\r\nknowledge and proficiency have been attained in any branch of the\r\nscience.\r\n\r\nThe world is the geologist's laboratory; it is the only limit to his\r\nactivities. The frontiers are near at hand, both physically and\r\nintellectually. There are few fields so attractive from the scientific\r\nstandpoint. There are few in which the successful prosecution of the\r\nscience can be of so much direct benefit to civilization and can yield\r\nsuch large financial rewards. If, in addition, the opportunities for\r\ntravel and adventure are taken into account, what profession promises a\r\nmore interesting and useful life?\r\n\r\nSo far we have discussed geology as a profession. It has proved its\r\nvalue also as a training for administrative and other public careers.\r\nThe profession contributes its full share of men to these activities.\r\nThe practice of geology deals with a wide variety of factors, and\r\nrequires the constant exercise of judgment in balancing, correlating,\r\nand integrating these factors in order to reach sound conclusions. This\r\nobjective treatment of complex situations is valuable training for the\r\nhandling of human affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\nETHICS OF THE ECONOMIC GEOLOGIST\r\n\r\nEthical questions involved in the practice of economic geology have\r\ncalled out much discussion, and, in some cases, marked differences of\r\nopinion among men equally desirous of doing the right thing. In the\r\nplain choice between right and wrong, there is of course no difference\r\nof opinion. Unfortunately in many of the questions which arise the\r\nalternatives are not so clearly labeled.\r\n\r\nThe lure of discovery and quick returns always has, and doubtless always\r\nwill, draw into the field large numbers of persons without sound ethical\r\nanchorage or standards. Fortunately, these are not the persons in\r\ncontrol of the mineral industries; they are mere incidents in the great\r\nand stable business built up by legitimate demands for raw materials.\r\n\r\nThe view is sometimes expressed that the geologist should hold himself\r\naloof from the business or applied phases of his profession, because of\r\nthe danger of being tainted with commercialism. This argument would\r\napply to the engineer as well as to the geologist. To carry such a\r\nprocedure through to its logical conclusion would mean substantially the\r\nwithdrawal of scientific aid from industry,--which, to the writer, is\r\nhardly a debatable question. Circumstances are trending inevitably to\r\nthe larger use of geologic science in the commercial field. The problems\r\nof ethics cannot be solved by staying out. The economic geologist is\r\nrather called upon to do his part in raising the standards of ethics in\r\nthat part of the field in which he has influence. This he can do by\r\ncareful appraisal of all the conditions relating to a problem which he\r\nis asked to take up, and by refusing to act where questionable ethical\r\nstandards are apparent or suspected. He must understand fully the\r\npurposes for which his report is to be used; merely as a matter of\r\nprofessional self-interest, there is no other course open to him. In a\r\nfield in which there is so much danger from loose ethical conceptions,\r\nthe premium on rigid honesty and nice appreciation of professional\r\nethics is proportionately higher. The extreme care taken in this matter\r\nby acknowledged leaders in the profession of economic geology should be\r\ncarefully considered by the young man entering the profession. There is\r\na reason.\r\n\r\nIn other chapters reference is made to certain special ethical\r\nquestions, such as the use of geology in mining litigation (pp.\r\n349-355), and the necessity of the geologist's recognizing his own\r\nlimitations (pp. 92-94), but no attempt has been made to cover the\r\nvariety of such questions that may come up. It is safe to assume that no\r\nspecial ethical code can be made sufficiently comprehensive, detailed,\r\nand elastic to cover all the contingencies which are likely to be met in\r\nthe practice of economic geology; nor is it likely that any such code,\r\nif attempted, would be any improvement on the spirit of the Golden Rule.\r\nSimple decency and common sense in their broader implications are\r\nessential to the practice of the profession.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n  Abrasives, 267-270, 397\r\n\r\n  Abyssinia, potash, 112\r\n\r\n  Adams, Frank D., 367\r\n\r\n  Adirondacks, New York, graphite, 282\r\n    iron ores, 160, 162, 163, 171\r\n    phosphate from magnetic ores, 105-106\r\n    use of magnetic surveys in tracing iron rocks, 317\r\n\r\n  Ad valorem method of valuation of mineral deposits, 331-335\r\n\r\n  Africa, bauxite, 242\r\n    coal, 116\r\n    cobalt, 255\r\n    copper, 197-198, 205\r\n    tin, 260\r\n      _See also_ South Africa; North Africa; East Africa; West Africa.\r\n  Alabama, bauxite, 243, 245\r\n    graphite, 281\r\n    iron, 52-53, 160, 162, 163, 166-167\r\n\r\n  Alaska, antimony, 248\r\n    copper, 36, 41, 47, 49, 199, 200-201\r\n    gold, 222, 224, 229\r\n    silver, 234\r\n    tin, 261, 262\r\n\r\n  Algeria, antimony, 247, 248\r\n    gypsum, 283\r\n    iron, 156, 160, 161, 194\r\n    petroleum, 128\r\n    phosphates, 104, 105, 106\r\n      _See also_ North Africa.\r\n\r\n  Almaden, Spain, mercury ores, 256-257, 259\r\n\r\n  Alsace, potash, 111-113\r\n\r\n  Alsace-Lorraine, coal and iron of, under Peace Treaty, 401-402\r\n\r\n  Aluminum Company of America, 243\r\n\r\n  Aluminum ores, 241-246, 397\r\n    _See also_ Bauxite.\r\n\r\n  Alunite, 39, 41-42, 112, 114, 230\r\n\r\n  Anaconda, Montana, arsenic production, 250\r\n\r\n  Anaconda Copper Mining Company, manufacture of phosphate, 105\r\n    use of geology in development and exploration, 326-327\r\n\r\n  Anamorphism, defined, 27, 57\r\n\r\n  Anamorphism of mineral deposits, 26, 57-58\r\n\r\n  Anhydrite, occurrence in gypsum deposits, 284-285\r\n\r\n  Anticlines, occurrence of oil in, 141-142, 147-148\r\n\r\n  Antimonial lead, 246\r\n\r\n  Antimony ores, 246-249, 398\r\n\r\n  Apex law, 349-350, 353\r\n\r\n  Aplites, 35\r\n\r\n  Appalachians, barite, 274\r\n    bauxite, 245\r\n    graphite, 282-283\r\n    petroleum, 132, 135\r\n    pitchblende, 266\r\n    pyrite, 108\r\n    tin, 262\r\n      _See also_ under individual states.\r\n\r\n  Argentina, borax, 275\r\n    mica, 286\r\n    petroleum, 128\r\n    tungsten, 183\r\n\r\n  Arizona, asbestos, 271, 272\r\n    copper, 33, 38, 41, 47, 48, 198-199, 203, 204-205, 208, 314, 316\r\n    gold, 222\r\n    manganese, 175\r\n    molybdenum, 186,187\r\n    silver, 234\r\n    tungsten, 183\r\n    turquoise, 293\r\n\r\n  Arkansas, bauxite, 96, 243, 244-245, 246\r\n    diamonds, 292\r\n    fuller's earth, 279\r\n    hones, oilstones and whetstones, 269\r\n    phosphates, 105\r\n    zinc, 215\r\n\r\n  Arnold, Ralph, 134, 136, 149-150\r\n\r\n  Arsenic ores, 249-251, 397\r\n\r\n  Artesian wells, 73\r\n\r\n  Asbestos, 270-272, 398\r\n\r\n  Asphalt and bitumen, 56, 151-153, 397\r\n\r\n  Atolia, California, tungsten ores, 185\r\n\r\n  Atwood, W.
