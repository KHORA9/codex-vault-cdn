Gilson\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\nAlthough the term \"Waste Places\" carries an implied meaning of\r\n\"worthless,\" yet, interpreted in the light of Nature's methods, each\r\nregion described, useless as it may apparently seem, possesses a\r\ndefinite relation to the rest of the world, and therefore to the\r\nwell-being of man. The Sahara is the track of the winds whose moisture\r\nfertilizes the flood-plains of the Nile. The Himalaya Mountains condense\r\nthe rain that gives life to India. From the inhospitable polar regions\r\ncome the winds and currents that temper the heat of the tropics.\r\n\r\nNature has secreted many of her most useful treasures in most forbidding\r\nplaces. The nitrates which fertilize so much of Europe are drawn from\r\nthe fiercest of South American deserts, and the gold which measures\r\nAmerican commerce is mined in the arctic wilds of Alaska or in the\r\nalmost inaccessible scarps of the western highlands. The description of\r\nthese regions and the portrayal of their relation to the rest of the\r\nworld is the purpose of Part I of this book.\r\n\r\nPart II of the book deals with Oceania--more especially with our island\r\npossessions in the Pacific Ocean. It presents the salient features of\r\nthe ocean grand division in the light of most recent knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe author wishes to give credit to Mr. Jacques W. Redway, F.R.G.S., for\r\nsuggesting the subject of Part I and for the inspiration he received\r\nfrom the distinguished geographer in developing the subject.\r\n\r\nJ. C.

In any well-equipped\r\nlibrary we may find great numbers of useful books that will tell us all\r\nabout the places where cotton, wool, and silk are grown, or where coal\r\nand iron are mined. All these lands are the dwelling places of many\r\npeople. Networks of railways connect the various cities and villages,\r\nand probably a majority of the people living in them have travelled in\r\nand about much of the area of these lands.\r\n\r\nA large part of the earth's surface is commonly called \"unproductive.\"\r\nAs a rule this is only another way of saying that such parts of the\r\nworld produce little foodstuffs. We must not take the word\r\n\"unproductive\" either too literally or too seriously, however, for Dame\r\nNature has a way of secreting some of her choice treasures in places so\r\nforbidding and so desolate that only the most resolute and daring men\r\neven search for them. For instance, the mineral once much used by the\r\nmakers of carbonated or \"soda\" water comes from a part of Greenland that\r\nis so bleak, cold, and inhospitable that no human beings can long exist\r\nthere unless food and fuel are brought them from afar off. The famous\r\n\"nitrates\" of Chile are obtained in the fiercest part of the Andean\r\ndesert. Not only the food but the water consumed must be carried to the\r\nminers, who are but little better than slaves. Most of the gold and\r\nsilver is obtained in regions that are unfit for human habitation. The\r\nlargest diamond fields in the world are in a region that will not\r\nproduce even grass without irrigation--a region that would not be\r\ninhabited were there no diamonds. From the most inhospitable highlands\r\nof Asia comes a very considerable part of the precious mineral, jade.\r\nDeath Valley, in the southern part of the United States, on account of\r\nits terrific heat, is perhaps the most unhabitable region in the world,\r\nbut the borax which it produces is used in every civilized country. And\r\nso we might name regions by the score that are practically unhabitable,\r\nwhich nevertheless produce things necessary to civilized man.\r\n\r\nWe call them \"waste places,\" but this is far from true. For the greater\r\npart they are quite as necessary as the places we call fertile. Of\r\nfoodstuffs, for instance, the greater part of the Rocky Mountain\r\nhighland produces not much more than the State of New York. Yet the\r\npresence of this great mountain wall diverts the moist warm air from the\r\nGulf of Mexico northward, making the Mississippi basin one of the\r\nforemost granaries of the world. The absence of rain in the west slope\r\nof the Peruvian Andes makes much of the western part of Chile and Peru a\r\ndesert. But that same absence of rain makes the nitrate beds possible;\r\nfor had there been yearly rains, the nitrates long since would have been\r\nleached out. So, the lands the nitrates now fertilize are far greater in\r\narea than that of the region of the nitrates.\r\n\r\nThen, perhaps, we turn our eyes oceanward. What! wealth in these great\r\nwastes? Most certainly, and indispensable wealth at that. Let us forget\r\nfor a moment that the oceans produce about as much meatstuffs as the\r\nland; this is really the least important feature about them. The oceans\r\nproduce one thing that is absolutely necessary for every living thing\r\nalmost every hour of the day, and that is fresh water. Every drop of\r\nfresh water that falls on the land is born of the ocean. Even the cold,\r\npolar oceans are indispensable to life, for their waters are constantly\r\nflowing out into the warmer oceans, thereby tempering the water of the\r\nlatter and preventing it from being too warm for living things.\r\n\r\nThus we see that, after all, Dame Nature is not very unkind to her\r\nsubjects. Compensation is her great law; if her supplies are \"short\" in\r\none direction they are \"long\" in another. And when we take the broader\r\nview we must conclude that there are no waste places. It is only when we\r\ntake the extreme and narrow view that we voice the persiflage of the\r\npoet Pope:\r\n\r\n    \"While man exclaims: 'See all things for my use'--\r\n    'See man for mine,' replies a pampered goose.\"\r\n\r\nNow, these waste places are of various kinds and in pretty nearly every\r\nlocality. Some are deserts pure and simple; some are very dry and, to\r\navoid hurting our national feelings, we politely refer to them as \"arid\r\nregions\"; some are so rugged and inaccessible that nothing short of\r\ndirigible balloons and aeroplanes could open a general communication\r\nwith them; still others are in polar regions and too bleak and desolate\r\nto produce foodstuffs or support human life. The purpose of these\r\nchapters is to present the characteristics of these waste places. Most\r\nof them have been conquered by man, and their resources have been opened\r\nwide to the world. Possibly others yet remain to be conquered, but \"what\r\nman has done, man can do.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTHE WEALTH OF THE ARID SOUTHWEST\r\n\r\n\r\nYears ago the maps of the United States depicted a vast region west of\r\nthe Missouri River stippled with dots, which were supposed to imitate\r\nsand, and marked with the portentous legend, \"Great American Desert.\" As\r\nsturdy pioneers pushed their settlements farther and farther westward,\r\nthe great American desert began to shrink in size until the roseate\r\ndescriptions of prospectors and land speculators led one to believe that\r\nthis whole region needed only a touch of the plough and the harrow to\r\nproduce the most bountiful crops grown anywhere in the world.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the great domain extending from the\r\ntwenty-five-hundred-foot level to the crest of the Sierra Nevada\r\nMountains is a region so deficient in rainfall that, for the greater\r\npart, ordinary foodstuffs will not grow without irrigation; so farming\r\nmust be confined mainly to the flood-plains of the rivers. Here and\r\nthere considerable areas have been made fertile by capturing rivers,\r\ndamming their streams so as to create great reservoirs, and then\r\nmeasuring out the waters to the farm lands below. The Salt River dam in\r\nArizona, recently completed, will supply water to two thousand square\r\nmiles, or about twenty-five thousand fifty-acre farms.\r\n\r\nBut in spite of all that man has done and can do to make this region\r\nfruitful, not far from half a million square miles will ever remain\r\nbarren so far as the production of foodstuffs is concerned. Now this\r\nwhole region, irrigated lands included, does not produce more wealth\r\nthan the State of New York alone--possibly it does not produce so much.\r\n\r\nIndirectly, however, it is worth more than two thousand million dollars\r\nyearly to the rest of the United States; for it is a great highland\r\nwhose rims, the Sierra Nevada and the Rocky Mountain ranges, are about\r\ntwo miles high. Now, these lofty ranges wring almost every drop of\r\nmoisture from the rain-bearing winds of the Pacific Ocean, leaving them\r\ntoo dry to shed any moisture over the eastern half of the United States.\r\nBecause of this great mountain barrier, the winds that bring rain and\r\nbountiful crops to the Mississippi Valley and the Atlantic slope, follow\r\nan easier passage, flowing directly from the Gulf of Mexico and the\r\nCaribbean Sea. And the copious rains are the chief wealth of this\r\nmidland region.\r\n\r\nBut the arid western highland possesses a great wealth of its own--a\r\nwealth whose influence is world-wide, for it is one of the world's chief\r\nstorehouses of gold, silver, and copper. Gold and silver are the mediums\r\nof commercial transactions, and copper is the chief medium for the\r\ntransmission of electric power. These metals, therefore, are quite as\r\nnecessary as are iron and steel. Moreover, this great waste, a seeming\r\nincubus on the face of the earth, is each year disclosing more and more\r\nof its mineral and agricultural wealth.\r\n\r\nGold is the most widely disseminated of all metals, and is said to be\r\nwhere you find it. That this statement is true has been demonstrated\r\nmany times, especially during the last few decades. In the north it has\r\nbeen found in the frozen ground of Alaska and Siberia, in the south in\r\nthe sands on the surf-beaten shores of Tierra del Fuego and in the reefs\r\nof the Transvaal, while it is found in numerous places lying between\r\nthese extremes.\r\n\r\nThe vast tract of land in the western part of the United States whence\r\nmost of these metals are obtained has been the scene of many tragedies.\r\nIt is an inhospitable region, scanty in both animal and vegetable life,\r\nwhere climatic conditions call for heroic daring on the part of those\r\nwho would search out its hidden mysteries; it is a land of death-dealing\r\nmirages, yet containing untold wealth for the miner, and likewise for\r\nthe husbandman who can irrigate the fallow parched surface.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mohave Desert, California. Buzzards' Roost]\r\n\r\nThe bold prospector has unearthed in many places of southern Nevada\r\ngold-bearing rock assaying thousands of dollars to the ton, the result\r\nbeing the building up of cities and towns and the construction of\r\nconnecting railroads to meet the demands of the growing commerce. Until\r\nrecently, silver was the principal metal sought and found in the State\r\nof Nevada; but now gold is king, and his throne has been shifted from\r\none desert camp to another, each laying claim to his abundant presence,\r\nwhile new claimants are ever bringing new treasures into light.\r\n\r\nThe two most valuable deposits of the precious metals now known in\r\nNevada are at Tonopah and Goldfield, the discovery of the first having\r\nbeen made in 1901 and of the latter in the following year. Some of the\r\nGoldfield ore has assayed as high as thirty thousand dollars per ton,\r\nand so rich were many of its ores that they were sacked and carefully\r\nguarded until landed at the reduction works. In one year and a half from\r\nthe discovery of gold at Goldfield the output reached four million\r\ndollars.\r\n\r\nThese mines of the Nevada deserts excel in the richness and abundance of\r\ntheir ores, while in the future these camps bid fair to outrival in\r\ndevelopment all other sections of the United States. A few years ago the\r\nsouthern part of the Silver State was considered utterly worthless and a\r\nregion to be shunned like a charnel-house, on account of its barren and\r\ndangerous character. Now it is the Mecca of the gold-seeker.\r\n\r\nThese mines have already made many a poor man wealthy and many a wealthy\r\nman a millionaire. Each hillock, ledge, or ravine holds a possible\r\nfortune, and no hardship and peril is too great for the prospector lured\r\nby the hope of a rich find. The prosperous desert mining town, first\r\nbuilt of canvas and rough lumber, is soon replaced by a better class of\r\nbuildings, and water is brought through long miles of pipe from the\r\nnearest available source. Anon, electric-lighting and other modern\r\nconveniences are added, thereby making life more tolerable in a fierce\r\nclimate of heat and cold, of fiercer winds and blinding dust.\r\n\r\nNot only is gold found in these desert wastes, but borax, nitre,\r\nsulphur, silver, salt, soda, opals, garnets, turquoises, onyx, and\r\nmarble form a part of its resources. Rich gold mines have built the\r\ntowns of Randsburg and Johannesburg in the midst of the Mohave desert,\r\nwhile finds of rich ore made elsewhere are of frequent occurrence. It is\r\nthought that in the near future sufficient nitre can be obtained from\r\nthe deserts of California and Nevada to render the United States\r\nindependent of Chile, from whose desert, Atacama, the world's chief\r\nsupply of this mineral is now obtained.\r\n\r\nPerhaps there is no part of the United States more healthy and at the\r\nsame time more deadly than the southeastern part of California, embraced\r\nin those indefinite areas called the Mohave and Colorado deserts. That\r\nlife and death should lay claim to the same regions with equal strength\r\nseems somewhat of a riddle, but a careful investigation of the\r\nconditions will make good the claims of both. Here are regions rivalling\r\nthe Sahara in heat, lack of water, and barrenness, and in many parts as\r\ndifficult to traverse; regions full of surprises in deceptive mirages,\r\npeculiar vegetation, strange animal life, occasional cloud-bursts, purity\r\nand exhilarating effects of atmosphere, charm of ever-changing colors\r\nreflected from the mountains, wealth of floral display in early spring,\r\nand marvellous fertility of soil when touched by the magic wand of\r\nwater. All these and a certain weirdness of beauty difficult to define\r\ngive these great wastes a peculiar attraction of their own which only\r\nthose who have spent much time there can understand and appreciate.\r\n\r\nFor the dread white plague in its early stages there is no medicine and\r\nno other climate that can equal the pure, healing atmosphere of these\r\ndeserts. A new lease of life may be gained by the nerve-racked man or\r\nwoman who will lay aside all home worries and spend a few months at some\r\ncongenial home on one or another of these deserts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Gila monsters]\r\n\r\nAmong the animal life found on the desert are the wildcat, coyote,\r\nrabbit, deer, rat, tortoise, scorpion, centipede, tarantula, Gila\r\nmonster, chuck-walla, desert rattlesnake, side-winder, humming-bird,\r\neagle, quail, and road-runner. Wild horses and wild donkeys, or\r\n\"burros,\" frequent these great wastes, cropping the vegetation that\r\ngrows on the oases.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting of these animals is the desert-rat, whose\r\nhabits, seemingly intelligent and equally curious, enable him to\r\nmaintain a home amid surroundings most unfavorable to his survival. He\r\nis a big, active fellow of a glossy gray color, and since he always\r\nleaves something in place of whatever he may carry off, he is often\r\ncalled the trade rat. Night-time is his \"busy day.\"\r\n\r\nThe house that he builds for himself is a veritable fortified castle\r\nbuilt in up-to-date desert-rat style, under a protecting bush or rock,\r\nor beside a cactus--preferably a prickly pear. This stronghold, from\r\nfour to five feet long and three feet high, is made of sticks interwoven\r\nwith pieces of prickly cactus, thorny twigs, and odd bits in\r\ngeneral--great care being taken to have most of the thorns project\r\noutward. His private quarters consist of a shallow hole burrowed under\r\nthe centre of this thorn-woven pile. Access to the interior is gained by\r\na winding passage.\r\n\r\nThe only enemy that might try to thread the mazy hallway is the rattler,\r\nwho by an ingenious device is deterred from even making the attempt. To\r\nkeep his snakeship from intruding on domestic privacy Mr. Rat takes\r\nseveral strips of spiny cactus and lays them flatways across the\r\npassageway leading to his retreat.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that a rattlesnake will not crawl over a prickly\r\nsubstance; hence a traveller when camping out at night in rattlesnake\r\nregions often surrounds his sleeping place with a horsehair rope as a\r\nsafeguard against such an unwelcome intruder. Even the hungry, prowling\r\ncoyote, who would make short work of the rat could he but get at him,\r\nfights shy of lacerating his paws by attempting to tear down the\r\nformidable pile.\r\n\r\nThe desert-rat has a morbid desire to carry to his home any small\r\narticle which he may chance to find lying around, as many a desert miner\r\nhas found to his discomfiture, but he always leaves something in its\r\nplace, such as a strip of cactus or a stick.\r\n\r\nFor downright strategy no creature inhabiting the desert surpasses the\r\nroad-runner, sometimes called the ground-cuckoo or snake-killer. Though\r\nomnivorous, this bird lives chiefly on reptiles and mollusks. It is\r\ndecked in a gay plumage of coppery green, with streaks of white on the\r\nsides and a topknot of deep blue. In fleetness of foot it is said to\r\nequal the horse. Many stories are told of its surrounding a coiled\r\nsleeping rattlesnake with strips of cactus and then tantalizing its\r\nvictim until, baffled in every attempt to get away, the snake finally\r\ninflicts a deadly bite on itself. Then the road-runner leisurely\r\nproceeds to devour the suicide.\r\n\r\nThe characteristic plants of these deserts are sage, mesquite,\r\ngreasewood, and a great variety of cacti. Of the cactus family, the most\r\nconspicuous is the _saguaro_, or giant cactus, which frequently attains\r\nthe height of fifty feet. All the cacti are leafless and abundantly\r\nsupplied with sharp, needle-like spines which protect them from\r\nherbivorous animals. The bark or outer covering has a firm, close\r\ntexture that prevents the sap from evaporating during the long, dry\r\nseason. In traversing the deserts during May and June, one is amazed at\r\nthe display of beautiful blossoms of white, yellow, purple, pink, and\r\nscarlet issuing from their thorny stalks.\r\n\r\nThe plant most welcome to the thirsty traveller, and which has saved the\r\nlives of many a wandering prospector, is the \"well of the desert,\" a\r\nbarrel-shaped cactus thickly studded with sharp spines. When one cuts\r\nout the centre of the plant in a bowl-like form, the cavity soon fills\r\nup with a watery liquid that is most refreshing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A giant cactus in Arizona]\r\n\r\nHot and forbidding as are these terrible wastes, they are the dwelling\r\nplaces of several tribes of Indians. The desert cactus furnishes them a\r\nlarge part of their food, and the fibre is woven into cloth to provide\r\nthem with clothing. These Indians have been acclimated to the desert for\r\ncenturies and are well versed in all of its moods and mysteries. They\r\nknow of no better abode; neither can they be induced to leave it for a\r\nmore congenial climate and fertile soil. Travellers and prospectors have\r\ntold many stories about their experiences in these deserts. But perhaps\r\nno story has possessed a greater fascination than that of the lost\r\nPegleg Mine.\r\n\r\nThe story of this lost mine has been told and retold with many\r\nvariations for the past seventy years, and more than a score of persons\r\nhave lost their lives in attempting to rediscover it. In 1836, according\r\nto the traditional story, a man named Smith, distinguished from the rest\r\nof the Smith family by the possession of a wooden leg, was journeying\r\nwith several companions from Yuma over the Colorado desert. On account\r\nof his wooden stump he was dubbed \"Pegleg\" by his fellow-travellers.\r\n\r\nAfter having been out several days and not finding any springs or water\r\nholes, the prospectors became greatly alarmed and hastened toward three\r\nsmall buttes which they saw standing out in the desert, in the hope of\r\nfinding water in the dry wash leading from their bases. On arriving at\r\nthe foot of the hills they were sadly disappointed; diligent search\r\nrevealed no signs of water. He of the wooden leg climbed to the top of\r\none of the buttes to get a better view of the country, and to the\r\nnorthward saw a high mountain; but before descending, he observed some\r\nblack stones under his feet and on picking one up found it heavy and\r\nfilled with a brassy-colored metal. He then picked up several of the\r\nstones and put them into his pockets, but being desirous of reaching\r\nwater as soon as possible, he gave little thought to his find.\r\n\r\nHe told his companions of the mountain seen to the north and advised all\r\npossible haste to reach it, saying that he believed that they would\r\nthere find water. The next day at nightfall they succeeded in reaching\r\nthe base of the mountain in an exhausted condition and found a spring of\r\ncool, clear water. They were thus barely saved from a lingering death by\r\nthirst. The mountain was named Smith Mountain.\r\n\r\nAt San Bernardino, Smith showed his ore to an expert, who pronounced it\r\nnearly pure gold. The real importance of the discovery did not seem to\r\ndawn on the one-legged man, however, until thirteen years afterward;\r\nthen, in 1849, it was heralded to the world that wonderful discoveries\r\nof gold had been made in several parts of California and that a man\r\ncould dig out of the ground a fortune in a few days or weeks. Smith\r\nbecame enthusiastic and organized an expedition in San Francisco to seek\r\nfor his desert mine where gold could be had for the picking up.\r\n\r\nThe expedition started out from Los Angeles. One night, just before\r\nreaching Smith Mountain, the Indians who had been taken along to pack\r\nthe supplies secretly decamped with the provisions, thus compelling the\r\nprospectors to return as speedily as possible to save their lives. Smith\r\nfelt discouraged and left the company at San Bernardino. Whether he\r\nperished in again trying to find his mine or left the country is not\r\nknown. At any rate, he was never heard of afterward.\r\n\r\nIn 1860 a man named McGuire deposited in one of the San Francisco banks\r\nseveral thousand dollars in gold nuggets which he said he obtained near\r\nSmith Mountain. He organized a party of six to hunt for the Pegleg Mine.\r\nWhat they found, however, will never be known, for they all perished,\r\nand their bleached bones were found on the desert a long time afterward.\r\nThey were not alone in disaster, however, for very many others in trying\r\nto find the legacy of Smith have met the same fate.\r\n\r\nBut the hidden wealth of this great region, so long known as the \"Great\r\nAmerican Desert,\" is by no means confined to its storehouses of gold,\r\nsilver, and copper. Here, there, and almost everywhere are areas that\r\nlack but one element to make them the most productive regions of the\r\nworld, and that one element is water.\r\n\r\nThe conquest of the Colorado desert is not the first instance of desert\r\nland reclamation in the United States, but it is certainly one of the\r\nmarvels of the world's history. A more pronounced and inhospitable\r\ndesert never existed; and, in proportion to the area reclaimed, it is\r\ndoubtful if one can find greater productivity than the lands that\r\nconstitute Imperial Valley. Let us take a glance at nature's work in\r\nthis region.\r\n\r\nLong before the Mississippi was born the Colorado was an ancient river\r\nand it formerly flowed through a fertile valley. During countless ages\r\nit has stripped from the plateau and carried into the Gulf of California\r\na deposit of rock waste from the land surface of its basin many feet\r\ndeep, and abraded billions of tons of material from its channel. All\r\nthis silt and detritus have served to fill up the northern part of the\r\ngulf, the result of the deposit being an immense land area. At length a\r\ngreat bar was formed across the northern part of the gulf, making a sort\r\nof inland sea. Then the hot climate caused the water to evaporate, while\r\nfrom time to time the Colorado overflowed its banks, spreading a rich\r\nsediment over the former sea-bed.\r\n\r\nVarious parts of this depression, which, like Palestine, lie below the\r\nsea-level, are known as Salton, Coahuilla, and Imperial Valleys. The\r\nlowest part, now filled with water, is usually called the Salton Sea.\r\nThe whole of this region is comprehended under the name of Colorado\r\nDesert. In 1900 a company was formed to reclaim that part of the desert\r\nincluded in Imperial Valley, by taking water out of the Colorado River a\r\nfew miles below the boundary between California and Mexico.\r\n\r\nA main canal, called the Imperial Canal, one hundred miles long, seventy\r\nfeet wide, and eight feet deep carries water from the Colorado to\r\nImperial Valley, where it is distributed by hundreds of smaller canals.\r\nThe irrigation facilities are already sufficient to water more than one\r\nhundred thousand acres.\r\n\r\nThis region, rightly named the hot-house of America, produces marvellous\r\ncrops of hay, grain, and fruits; it is an ideal place for raising\r\nlive-stock and poultry as well. Some of this land already brings into\r\nits owners from three hundred dollars to seven hundred dollars yearly\r\nincome per acre, and because of its wonderful fertility it is likened to\r\nthe valley of the Nile.\r\n\r\nIn 1904 the Imperial Canal was filled with silt for some distance, thus\r\npreventing the flow of the proper amount of water needed for irrigation.\r\nTo remedy the defect a temporary canal was cut around the head-gate.\r\nThis expedient had been tried and then the gap had been closed up before\r\nhigh water. At this particular time high water came earlier than usual,\r\nand a great flood tore out the channel of the temporary canal to such an\r\nextent that before it could be prevented the whole Colorado River was\r\nflowing through the breach, leaving its own bed perfectly dry to the\r\nGulf of California, filling up the Salton Valley, burying up the Salton\r\nsalt-works, and making an inland sea such as formerly existed there.\r\nAfter most strenuous efforts, and at the enormous expense of upward of a\r\nmillion dollars, the gap was at length repaired and the Colorado made to\r\nflow in its own bed.\r\n\r\nOne should remember that in the development of these deserts the\r\nprospector owes a deep debt of gratitude to that patient, faithful\r\nlittle beast, the donkey, or \"burro,\" as it is commonly known; without\r\nthe service of this animal many a man would have suffered a lingering\r\ndeath. As a matter of fact, it is unsafe to venture far out into the\r\ndesert unaccompanied by this oft-maligned creature--about the only\r\nanimal fitted to carry supplies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Built by the U. S. Reclamation Service_ The Roosevelt\r\nDam, Arizona, showing south bridge and spillway]\r\n\r\nBut the use of dams and canals to conserve and supply water for\r\nirrigation prevailed even in most ancient times. Extensive irrigation\r\nworks were built in Egypt three thousand years ago, and in India, China,\r\nPersia, and the countries bordering on the Euphrates and Tigris Rivers\r\nirrigation dates back centuries before the Christian era.\r\n\r\nThe Romans introduced irrigation into southern Europe. When Pizarro\r\nconquered the empire of the Incas he found the people possessed of\r\nwonderful systems for irrigation. Likewise, Cortez found the Aztecs\r\nmaking extensive canals. Remains of great irrigation works are found\r\nto-day in Arizona and New Mexico, where our modern engineers wisely\r\nadopt the canal routes which were established by a race now extinct.\r\n\r\nAt the present time India is irrigating twenty-five million acres of\r\nland, the United States thirteen million, Egypt seven million, and Italy\r\nthree million. It is estimated that the United States has left one\r\nhundred and eighty million acres of arid and semi-arid land available\r\nfor reclamation and four times as much that is incapable of being\r\nreclaimed.\r\n\r\nNo other question of to-day is of such vital and far-reaching importance\r\nas that of the reclamation of the millions of acres of sleeping arid\r\nlands in the western part of our country. Mines may be exhausted,\r\nforests slain, and cities annihilated, but wastes made fruitful through\r\nthe potency of water will remain everlasting sources of wealth to the\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nDuring the last few years our government has been very active in\r\npromoting irrigation by building impounding dams and constructing canals\r\nand tunnels for the delivery of water. In connection with the various\r\nirrigation works the government has already established five\r\nhydro-electric plants which furnish water, motive power, and light as\r\nmay be required. From the big Roosevelt Dam and the drops of the level\r\nin the canal connected therewith, twenty-six thousand horse-power will\r\nbe developed incidental to the reclamation of two hundred thousand acres\r\nof land.\r\n\r\nThe miracle-working agent, water, has already reclaimed thirteen million\r\nacres of our domain, and these areas now produce two hundred and sixty\r\nmillion dollars annually; moreover, they furnish homes to more than\r\nthree hundred thousand people. Prosperous rural communities with\r\nthousands of happy, rosy-cheeked children, blooming orchards, broad,\r\nfertile fields prolific beyond comparison, and flourishing cities\r\nreplace wastes of sand and sage-brush.\r\n\r\nThe United States Government alone has spent already sixty millions of\r\ndollars under the Reclamation Act which went into effect in 1902, and\r\nthe end is not yet, for as the vista of human achievements in this line\r\nbroadens still greater works will be inaugurated and successfully\r\nconsummated. In Arizona, California, Colorado, South Dakota, Montana,\r\nNew Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming the United States\r\nGovernment already is working on or has completed twenty-six important\r\nirrigation projects.\r\n\r\nThe most wonderful work combining the highest engineering skill and\r\ndaring is found in the western part of Colorado, where from Black\r\nCanyon, an almost inaccessible gorge three thousand feet deep, the whole\r\nGunnison River has been diverted to the Uncompahgre Valley. To take the\r\nwater out of the river it was necessary to bore a tunnel six miles long\r\nthrough a mountain from the canyon to the valley.\r\n\r\nTo determine the feasibility of diverting the course of the river, it\r\nwas first necessary to make an exploration of the canyon. No one before\r\nhad ever had the hardihood to even make the attempt, on account of the\r\nextreme danger of a journey between the narrow black walls of this\r\ngloomy abyss.\r\n\r\nIn 1853 Captain Gunnison discovered the river which bears his name. He\r\ntraced its course to where it plunged into a chasm so deep and dangerous\r\nthat he feared to follow it farther and named the gorge Black Canyon.\r\nSome twenty years later Professor Hayden of the United States Geological\r\nSurvey, looking over the brink of the abyss, declared it inaccessible.\r\n\r\nThe State of Colorado, desiring to find some way of utilizing the waters\r\nof the Gunnison River for irrigating the arid land adjacent, in 1900\r\ncalled for volunteers to explore the canyon. Five men responded.\r\n\r\nProvided with boats, life-lines, and other accessories, the men started\r\nfrom Cimarron on their perilous trip. On the third day their provisions\r\ngave out, and later they were obliged to abandon their boats and nearly\r\neverything else except their blankets, which were protected in rubber\r\nbags. They knew it was impossible to retrace their steps and that their\r\nonly salvation lay in going on. At night they rolled themselves up in\r\ntheir blankets and tried to encourage one another. They travelled\r\nfourteen miles between granite walls from two thousand to three thousand\r\nfeet high; and for sixteen days they were almost without food. Then they\r\ncame to a cleft in their prison walls which seemed to offer a means of\r\nescape.\r\n\r\nAt their feet the water plunged over a precipice down to an unknown\r\ndepth. To go on meant almost instant death. They were dying of\r\nstarvation. Should they go on? They had not accomplished their task.\r\nLife was sweet and there were loved ones dependent upon them for\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\nSo they decided to attempt escape while they had strength. Wearily they\r\nclimbed the steep and rugged path that led them to freedom. Starting\r\nearly in the morning, they reached the summit, two thousand five hundred\r\nfeet above the raging torrent, at nine o'clock at night. They were ready\r\nto drop in their tracks, yet hope inspired them to renewed exertions.\r\nThey struggled on fifteen miles more ere they staggered into a\r\nfarm-house on the verge of collapse.\r\n\r\nIn the following year, 1901, the United States Government, becoming\r\ninterested in diverting the waters of the Gunnison, sent out one of its\r\nengineers, Professor Fellows, to look into the practicability of the\r\nproject. After looking over the field, the government engineer succeeded\r\nin enlisting in his service Mr. Torrence, who was a member of the first\r\nexpedition. They planned to accomplish the feat which the former\r\nexplorers failed to accomplish, namely, to go entirely through Black\r\nCanyon.\r\n\r\nProfiting by the previous trip, they provided for themselves a complete\r\nequipment, consisting of a rubber raft, two long life-lines, rubber bags\r\nfor food and clothing, a camera, hunting-knives, and belts. Until they\r\nreached the water-falls where the previous expedition had left the\r\ncanyon, the \"Fall of Sorrow,\" the first part of their trip possesses\r\nlittle of interest beyond what had been experienced before. But from\r\nthis point on unknown dangers menaced them.\r\n\r\nThe roar of the plunging water from below rose upward with a deafening\r\nsound as they gazed into the seething current. The rising mists obscured\r\nthe tree tops on either side far below. Should they press on or retreat,\r\nas those before them had done? Yes, they must go forward whatever the\r\nhazard. They clasped hands, bidding each other good-by. Torrence threw\r\nhimself into the water first and Fellows followed. A few seconds later\r\nboth clambered upon a bowlder in the pool below. The narrow cleft by\r\nwhich the former company effected their escape was passed and no\r\nalternative but to go forward was left to them.\r\n\r\nThey encountered many other perilous adventures in their thirty-mile\r\ntrip. Before they escaped from the canyon their provisions gave out.\r\nDeath by starvation stared them in the face once more. Weakened by\r\nhunger and about to give up, they spied at the base of a cliff two\r\nmountain sheep.\r\n\r\nNow, mountain sheep, which roam among the rugged crags, are exceedingly\r\ndifficult to catch. One of the sheep darted into a cleft. With a quick\r\nmovement born of desperation Torrence rushed before the opening, but\r\nscarcely had he reached the spot before the frightened sheep, in\r\nattempting to escape, jumped into his arms.\r\n\r\nRealizing that his life and that of his companion depended upon securing\r\nthe animal, he succeeded in killing it with his knife after a fierce\r\nstruggle. The meat obtained saved their lives and sustained them until\r\nthey reached a ranch fourteen miles from the place from which they\r\nemerged from the end of the canyon. In making the perilous journey they\r\nhad swum across the river seventy-four times.\r\n\r\nAlthough their instruments and most of the other articles which they had\r\ntaken were lost, yet the valuable data, sought for and recorded in the\r\nengineering book, were safely brought out and contained enough\r\nencouraging information to lead the government to take up the project of\r\ndiverting the waters of the Gunnison River to the Uncompahgre Valley.\r\n\r\nSalt River Valley, one of the most fertile sections of Arizona, has been\r\nsettled for many years, but the lack of a sufficient supply of water for\r\nextended irrigation has caused a large portion of this rich desert land\r\nto remain dormant. To meet the demand for more water in this valley the\r\nUnited States Government has just completed one of the greatest water\r\nimpounding reservoirs in the world, the construction of which called for\r\nthe greatest engineering skill and cost nearly nine million dollars.\r\n\r\nSalt River enters the valley after a tumultuous passage through a deep\r\nand rugged canyon forty miles long. It derives its name from the\r\nsaltness of its waters, which results from the discharge of salt springs\r\ninto the main stream as it courses through the gorge.\r\n\r\nThough unsuited for drinking purposes the water does not contain enough\r\nsalt to make it detrimental for irrigation, and the soil, stimulated by\r\nthe water, produces marvellous crops. Here extensive farming can be\r\ncarried on with the greatest success. Six crops of alfalfa, averaging\r\neight tons per acre, are harvested yearly. The oranges, dates, figs,\r\nlemons, grape fruit, olives, and peaches grown upon these lands are of\r\nsuperior quality and flavor and yield abundantly. The climate during\r\neight months of the year is unsurpassed.\r\n\r\nOstrich farming here is becoming an important industry. There are at the\r\npresent time in the valley about eight thousand birds, and the number is\r\nrapidly increasing. The value of the feathers plucked yearly from each\r\nfull-grown bird is from thirty dollars to forty dollars. Indications are\r\nthat in the near future Arizona will lead the world in ostrich farming\r\nand the production of ostrich feathers.\r\n\r\nThe history of this remarkable reservoir is full of human and natural\r\ninterest. It is located in a land whose civilization was old when Rome\r\nwas founded, a land of lost races, perpetual sunshine, forbidding\r\ndeserts, and picturesque wonders. Strange vegetation and scenes that are\r\nnovel are reflected in soft, changing tints from plain and mountain.\r\nFrom dawn to dark they possess an indescribable charm.\r\n\r\nThe government engineers, in looking over the ground, found an ideal\r\nspot for a reservoir formed by two valleys hedged in among the mountains\r\nat the head of the canyon. It was necessary only to build a dam across\r\nthe narrow cleft where the river enters the gorge in order to impound\r\nthe water.\r\n\r\nThe place being practically inaccessible, much preliminary work had to\r\nbe done before commencing construction on the dam. A road forty miles\r\nlong was made through the rugged mountains by which to transport\r\nprovisions, machinery, and other supplies. A greater part of the road\r\nwas cut out of the solid rock; other portions were constructed of\r\nmasonry. At places on this wonderful highway, a stone dropped over the\r\nedge of the road will fall almost a thousand feet without stopping. The\r\nscenery along the whole route is both beautiful and awe-inspiring.\r\n\r\nThe question of supplying cement for constructing the dam was for a\r\nwhile a difficult one; the price asked by the manufacturers was nine\r\ndollars per barrel delivered. The engineer then summoned to his aid the\r\ngovernment geologists, and they discovered near at hand limestone rock\r\nsuitable for making good cement. But in order to convert the limestone\r\ninto cement, it was necessary to have a mill and motive power to run it.\r\nCoal mines were five hundred miles away and such fuel would be too\r\ncostly. The engineer said, \"Why not use as a power electricity generated\r\nby the river itself?\"\r\n\r\nAccordingly a canal extending twenty miles up the river was constructed;\r\nwith a two-hundred-and-twenty-foot drop it was capable of delivering\r\nwater enough to generate four thousand two hundred horse-power. A mill\r\nwas built and an electric plant installed which ran the mill and machine\r\nshops besides furnishing power for laying the heavy stones, lighting the\r\nworks and town, and leaving a large surplus amount for pumping water\r\nfrom numerous wells in the Salt River Valley fifty miles away. By the\r\neconomy of self-manufacturing, the cost of the cement to the government\r\nwas but two dollars per barrel, thereby making a saving of nearly half a\r\nmillion dollars.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Shoshone Project, Wyoming Shoshone Canyon, looking\r\nupstream toward the dam. Dam, 328.4 feet high; storage capacity, 456,000\r\nacre-feet]\r\n\r\nTo provide proper accommodations for all of the employees and their\r\nfamilies, a regular town was built on the floor of the reservoir, to be\r\nsubmerged when the works should be completed and the flood gates closed.\r\nThe town, which was christened Roosevelt, contained a population of\r\nupward of two thousand, and bore the reputation of being the best\r\nbehaved in all Arizona.\r\n\r\nThe dam, also named after Colonel Roosevelt, then President of the\r\nUnited States, floods two valleys, one twelve and the other fifteen\r\nmiles long and each from one to three miles wide. The reservoir is\r\nnearly two hundred feet deep on the average. It is two hundred and\r\neighty feet high, and the thickness of the dam ranges from one hundred\r\nand seventy-five feet at the bottom to twenty feet at the top, where its\r\nlength is one thousand and eighty feet. Massive iron gates weighing\r\nsixty thousand pounds guard the outlet of the flood. To do the\r\npreliminary work and construct the dam nearly eight years were required,\r\nand during a part of this time a thousand men were employed both night\r\nand day, several hundred of whom were Apache Indians.\r\n\r\nThis region was previously the haunt of Chief Geronimo and his murderous\r\nband of Apaches. Near by are two groups of cliff dwellings formerly\r\noccupied by a race now extinct.\r\n\r\nThe capacity of this immense reservoir exceeds that of the Nile pent up\r\nby the Assouan dam, and the water would be sufficient to fill a canal\r\ntwo hundred feet wide and twenty feet deep, extending entirely across\r\nthe United States from the Atlantic to the Pacific. When full there is\r\nsufficient water to submerge the city of Washington to the depth of\r\nthirty-four feet.\r\n\r\nAmong the other many important irrigation works may be mentioned the\r\nShoshone and Rio Grande Dams. The Shoshone Dam in Wyoming impounds\r\nsufficient water to irrigate one hundred and fifty thousand acres in\r\nthe valley below. This dam was completed January 10, 1910, and is the\r\nhighest in the world, its height being three hundred and eighty-four\r\nfeet. Twelve miles below the dam proper a diversion dam was built across\r\nthe river which turns the stream into a tunnel connected at the other\r\nend with a canal, which delivers water upon one hundred thousand acres\r\nof fertile land.\r\n\r\nThe Rio Grande Dam involving the construction of a storage dam opposite\r\nEagle, New Mexico, across the Rio Grande River will irrigate one hundred\r\nand eighty thousand acres of land in New Mexico, Texas, and Mexico.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE GRAND CANYON OF THE COLORADO\r\n\r\n\r\nNowhere else on the face of the globe is one so vividly impressed by the\r\nvastness of the work of corrasion as in the northwestern part of\r\nArizona. Here the mutilated breast of Mother Earth discloses a chasm\r\nfrom three thousand feet to seven thousand feet deep, cut through\r\nhorizontal strata of sandstone, shale, limestone, and granite, chiefly\r\nby the agency of water.\r\n\r\nThis stupendous chasm is the Grand Canyon of the Colorado River. It is\r\nmore than two hundred miles long; and from rim to rim its walls measure\r\nin places twenty miles across. It is not a clean-cut open channel from\r\nwall to wall, but, on the contrary, it is filled with castellated peaks,\r\nbuttes, pinnacles, ridges, seams, and lesser canyons. Down deep in its\r\nlowest part, hurrying onward with impetuous speed, is the river itself.\r\n\r\nGeologists tell us that this stream was an ancient river before the\r\nMississippi was born and that it formerly watered a valley as fertile.\r\n\r\nAges ago when Time was young the river found its channel closed by an\r\nobstruction--just how, or where, or by what, no one knows. So it spread\r\nout into a great lake, or, perhaps, into an inland sea several thousand\r\nfeet deep. The rock waste carried into its basin hardened into\r\nsandstone--red, pink, and white of many shades.\r\n\r\nAfter this great inland sea had become dry the Colorado River was\r\nborn--just how, or when, or because of what, one can only guess. But\r\nwhen it was born it began to undo what its predecessor had done. It cut\r\na channel in the surface of the sandstone and then began business in\r\nearnest. It loosened little pieces of sharp flint from the sandstone and\r\nswept them along with such force that each became a tiny mallet and\r\nchisel combined to cut and carry away other rock. And so it kept on\r\nuntil it had carved a passage not only to the original granite bed rock\r\nbut in places a thousand feet or more into it. A few localities\r\nexcepted, the canyon does not form a single gash; nor has it the usual\r\nV-shape of canyons in regions of plentiful rainfall. On the contrary,\r\nits cross-section takes the form of a succession of steps and terraces,\r\nas though the river cut the channels successively in decreasing widths.\r\nAnd because the region through which it flows is one of very slight\r\nrainfall, all the landscape outlines are bold and sharply angular.\r\n\r\nAll told, an area comprising two hundred thousand square miles has been\r\ndenuded to the depth of six hundred feet, and the material borne\r\nsouthward by the Colorado and its tributaries, while the land through\r\nwhich they flow has been literally drained to death. Even the\r\ntributaries have formed deep lateral canyons that meet the level of the\r\nmain stream. It staggers the mind to try to grasp the time expressed in\r\ncountless eons since the youth of this now senile river.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Grand Canyon of the Colorado]\r\n\r\nAs early as 1540 Spanish explorers made known to the world the fact that\r\na deep and impassable gorge existed in one part of the Colorado River,\r\nand again in 1776 a Spanish priest revived a knowledge of its existence.\r\n\r\nThen, for many years afterward, the canyon claimed but little attention\r\nbecause it was so difficult of access, and so little was known of its\r\ncolossal dimensions and the marvellous carvings within its walls.\r\n\r\nJust above the Grand Canyon and continuous with it is Marble Canyon, so\r\ncalled because of the immense beds of marble that form a part of its\r\nwalls. In both canyons the limestone sometimes takes the form of marble,\r\nor gypsum, or alabaster--crystallized forms of limestone which take a\r\nfine polish.\r\n\r\nThis remarkable river with its canyons was first explored by Major\r\nPowell in 1869. With nine men and four boats he started from a landing\r\non Green River in Utah, floated down Green River to its junction with\r\nthe Grand, and thence down the Colorado below the mouth of the Virgin to\r\nthe Grand Wash. There he landed after having passed through the entire\r\nlength of the canyon.\r\n\r\nThe time spent in this voyage was ninety-eight days, and the distance\r\ntravelled was upward of one thousand miles. Four of his men left him\r\nwhen the voyage was but partly finished, being frightened by the perils\r\nthat beset them. They were killed by Indians. The others, after many\r\naccidents and hair-breadth escapes, succeeded in getting through in\r\nsafety.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the rapidity of the current the river has many rapids and\r\nwater-falls with jagged projecting rocks which make boating extremely\r\nhazardous. All these perils were conjectured but unknown to Major\r\nPowell's party, and every new bend of the river was liable to disclose\r\na cataract more dangerous than any encountered before. Then the\r\nreverberating sound of the roaring river as it struck the sides of its\r\nlofty prison walls together with the deep gloom of the mighty abyss was\r\ncalculated to terrify the bravest. Thus, facing death at every turn of\r\nthe stream, the men were kept constantly in a tense state of excitement.\r\n\r\nA wealth of adjectives has been expended in attempting properly to\r\ndescribe the immensity of this great handiwork of nature, and scores of\r\npersons have produced fascinating word-paintings of its awe-inspiring\r\ngrandeur.\r\n\r\nLeading back from the river the canyon walls are made up in part of\r\nshelving rocks and terraces. These, with peaks, buttes, and myriads of\r\nother structures arising from the great gulf, show plainly the different\r\nstrata of rocks of which they are composed. Many of these rocks are\r\nrichly colored; the tints as a rule result from the salts of iron and\r\nother mineral matter disseminated through them. In some instances the\r\ncoloring material of the upper strata has been washed down by the storms\r\nand has stained the rock of the walls below. This is the case in the\r\nGrand Canyon, where the limestone wall is colored red by the iron in an\r\noverlying stratum.\r\n\r\nWhen the gigantic forms partly filling the chasm, yet standing apart\r\nfrom each other, are seen near sunrise or sunset with their shifting\r\nshadows, they leave on the mind remembrances that will never fade.\r\n\r\nTo appreciate properly the magnitude and height of these towering masses\r\none should examine them not only by travelling along the brink, but by\r\ndescending to the river level in order to examine them from below. Then\r\nonly will the awful grandeur and immensity of this monumental\r\narchitecture of nature begin to dawn upon the understanding.\r\n\r\nTo the geologist this chasm is an intensely interesting book which\r\nreveals much of the history of the past in world-building.\r\n\r\nSome years ago a company was formed in New York to build a scenic\r\nrailroad through Marble and Grand Canyons. Engineers were sent out not\r\nonly to make a careful survey of the canyons but also to make a series\r\nof photographs which should form a continuous panoramic view of the\r\nproposed route. A large sum of money was spent in making the surveys;\r\nthen the project was abandoned. Possibly at some future time the scheme\r\nmay be revived and a road be built, using as its motive power\r\nelectricity generated by the river itself.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Canyon is now easily reached by the Santa Fé Railway system.\r\nFrom the main line at Williams a branch road extends to El Tovar, Grand\r\nCanyon station, which is located near the edge of the canyon. The\r\ndescent to the bottom of the canyon can be made by several trails. Those\r\nnoted for easy descent and the best views are Grand View and Red Canyon\r\nTrails from Grand View, Bright Angel Trail from El Tovar, and Bass Trail\r\nfrom Bass Camp. Each has its own special charms, and for one limited as\r\nto time it is difficult to make a choice.\r\n\r\nThe course of the Colorado and its tributary, Green River, presents some\r\ninteresting problems. The latter has cut its channel directly across the\r\nUinta Mountains, and the Colorado has sawed its channel to the base\r\nlevel of a series of plateaus, sometimes called the Sierra Abajo. And\r\nthe interesting problem is--how was the sawing process accomplished? It\r\nneeds only a moment's thought to understand that the river could not\r\nflow against the base of a mountain range and bore a passage through it,\r\nmuch less clear out an open passage miles in width.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Grand View Trail Looking toward Apache Point from Mystic\r\nSpring Plateau. The Grand Canyon of the Colorado]\r\n\r\nMajor Powell has shown how this mighty work of mountain cutting was\r\naccomplished; the sawing process was begun, not at the base of the\r\nrange, but at its top. It is merely a question of age. The Colorado and\r\nits chief tributaries are older than the mountain uplifts which they\r\nhave severed. Moreover, the level of their channels is much the same now\r\nas it was before the mountains were born.\r\n\r\nThe mountain levels, however, have been changing ever since their uplift\r\nbegan. And when the rock layers of which they are composed began to be\r\npushed upward the uplift was so slow that the rivers cut downward just\r\nas rapidly. In time the ranges were pushed upward to their present\r\nheight; but when the uplift was completed, in each case it was sawed to\r\nthe bottom by the river. It is in very much the same manner that a huge\r\nlog is cut in twain as it is pushed against the saw. The mountain range,\r\nas it is pushed upward, represents the log; the river, which is\r\nstationary, represents the saw.\r\n\r\nOne might look a long way to find the wealth created by this muddy\r\ntorrent. But the wealth is there, though it is certainly a long way from\r\nthe canyon; moreover, the rock waste itself is the wealth, and great\r\nwealth it is. The water of the river is very muddy. Dip up a bucket\r\nfilled to the brim and allow it to stand for ten or twelve hours. There\r\nis an inch or two of clear water at the top, while at the bottom there\r\nis a thick, muddy paste of sand, clay, and red earth. All this rock\r\nwaste the current is sweeping along to the Gulf of California.\r\n\r\nEvery overflow along the banks of its lower course spreads this rich,\r\nnutritious rock waste over the flood plain. Imperial Valley is filled\r\nwith it; and this, together with the flood plain above and below,\r\nconstitutes an area of productive land about as large as the State of\r\nIllinois. Moreover, the area is constantly increasing, because of the\r\nenormous amount of rock waste which the river daily bears to the Gulf\r\nof California. In time, a long time as years are measured, the gulf will\r\nbe entirely filled--and what a valley of prairie land there will be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nYELLOWSTONE PARK\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the northwestern part of Wyoming, at the summit of the continent, is\r\na tract of land containing more than three thousand square miles. It is\r\na region which attracts thousands of sightseers every year; yet\r\ninconceivable as it may now seem, this marvellous region was unknown to\r\nthe world until 1870. Being difficult of access, because flanked by high\r\nmountains on all sides, and possessing no mineral deposits of value,\r\nthere was but little inducement for any one but a hunter or a trapper to\r\npenetrate it.\r\n\r\nJohn Coulter, a frontiersman, was probably the first white man to set\r\nfoot within its territory. He was a member of the Lewis and Clark\r\nExpedition and, having observed that there were many beavers in the\r\nheadwaters of the Missouri River, desired to try trapping there. Having\r\nobtained permission to leave the expedition before its return to St.\r\nLouis, he forthwith set out to hunt and trap in that region. This was in\r\n1807.\r\n\r\nWhile following his favorite employment he met with many strange and\r\nexciting adventures with both Indians and wild beasts. And during his\r\nwanderings he beheld sights so marvellous as to tax the credulity of\r\neven his own senses; among them a glass mountain, geysers sending up\r\ngreat volumes of water hundreds of feet high into the air, boiling hot\r\nsprings, deep and gorgeously painted canyons, stupendous water-falls,\r\ncuriously colored rock formations, and a mountain lake filled with the\r\nfinest of fish.\r\n\r\nSo well versed was he in woodcraft that he could travel through pathless\r\nforests and over rugged mountains as unerringly as by well-beaten\r\ntrails. A love for wild nature and adventure had become his ruling\r\npassion. After hunting and trapping for several years he returned to St.\r\nLouis. Here he told his friends the marvels that he had seen and his\r\nadventures with Indians and wild beasts; but his hearers being doubting\r\nThomases, listened with incredulity to his astonishing stories.\r\n\r\nHe related his experiences and what he had seen to an editor of a St.\r\nLouis paper, who, after listening patiently to the narrative, informed\r\nCoulter that his wonderful adventures, glass mountain, and boiling\r\nsprings among the snows were falsehoods and could find no place for\r\npublication. Coulter gave interviews to many other persons, and stuck so\r\npersistently to his statements that the region which he had so minutely\r\ndescribed was derisively dubbed \"Coulter's Hell.\"\r\n\r\nCoulter's experiences certainly were marvellous. On one occasion, when\r\nhe and a companion were trapping along the Madison Fork of the Missouri\r\nRiver, they were surprised by a company of Blackfeet Indians who killed\r\nhis friend but spared his life for the time being. After the Indians had\r\nconsulted for some time in regard to what should be done with Coulter,\r\nthe chief asked him if he could run fast. Coulter replied that he could\r\nnot. He was in reality the fleetest runner among the western hunters,\r\nbut he told the Indians that he could not run fast, since he concluded\r\nthat there was a chance of saving his life by running should he be given\r\nthe opportunity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming Looking down\r\ncanyon from Grand Point]\r\n\r\nHe was stripped naked and taken several miles away to give the Indians\r\nsome sport before killing him. Then the chief commanded his followers to\r\nremain back while he led the captive some three hundred yards in front\r\nof them. At a given signal he told Coulter to save himself if he could.\r\nAt once the war whoop resounded and six hundred demons were on the track\r\nof the fugitive. Coulter strained every nerve to outdistance his\r\nmurderous pursuers. His great exertions caused the blood to spirt from\r\nhis nostrils and smear the front of his body.\r\n\r\nAfter running a while he heard footsteps, and turning saw an Indian with\r\na spear but a few yards behind him. Being exhausted, and fearing that at\r\nany moment the spear might be hurled at him, he concluded to surprise\r\nthe Indian. Stopping suddenly he wheeled about and presented his bloody\r\nbody and outstretched arms to the Indian.\r\n\r\nThe red man, greatly astonished, in attempting to stop quickly stumbled\r\nand fell, breaking his spear. Before the prostrate runner could recover\r\nhimself Coulter seized the head of the shaft and quickly pinioned his\r\nfoe to the ground.\r\n\r\nThen the fleeing hunter ran at his topmost speed toward the river, about\r\na mile distant. Arriving there a little ahead of his pursuers, he\r\nplunged into the water and swam as fast as he could. Observing a raft of\r\ndrift-wood that had lodged against a small island, he dived under the\r\ndébris, and thrusting his head up between the tree-trunks of the\r\nheterogeneous mass succeeded in getting into a position where he could\r\nbreathe and yet be concealed.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had he hidden himself than the yelling savages appeared on the\r\nriver's bank. They looked in all directions for their missing captive,\r\nbut in vain. They even went on the island and climbed over the\r\ndrift-wood, scanning every possible place of concealment. Seeing no\r\ntrace of their white prisoner they reluctantly returned to the mainland.\r\nCoulter remained under the raft in dreadful suspense until night, when,\r\nhearing nothing of his foes, he silently slipped from under the raft\r\nand swam down stream a long distance before landing.\r\n\r\nHis situation was now indeed a desperate one; his feet had become filled\r\nwith thorns from the prickly pear while running across the prairie; he\r\nwas also naked, hungry, and without means to kill the wild game for\r\nfood; moreover, the distance to the nearest fort was at least a\r\nseven-days' journey. But he was in excellent physical condition and,\r\nbeing inured to hardships and skilled in traversing the pathless\r\nwilderness, he at length reached the fort, having subsisted in the\r\nmeantime chiefly on roots whose nutritious value he had learned from the\r\nIndians.\r\n\r\nJohn Bridger, a famous hunter, was familiar with the region now known as\r\nYellowstone Park as early as 1830, and he endeavored to have his\r\ndescriptions of it published, but he could find no periodical or\r\nnewspaper willing to print his statements. In Bridger's case, however,\r\nthere was ground for doubt, inasmuch as he had a reputation for\r\nexaggeration, and the facts that he related about the wonders of the\r\nYellowstone were considered mere fabrications.\r\n\r\nOne of his most astounding stories concerned an elk. He claimed that\r\nwhile hunting he espied an elk that seemed to be only a short distance\r\naway; taking a good aim he fired, but the animal was unmoved by the\r\nshot. He again fired with more deliberation, yet with the same result as\r\nbefore. Having fired twice more with no effect he seized his rifle by\r\nthe barrel and rushed toward the antlered monarch; but all at once he\r\nran up against what seemed to be a high vertical wall. On investigation\r\nthe wall proved to be a mountain of perfectly transparent glass. And\r\nstill the elk kept on grazing quietly!\r\n\r\nThe strangest thing about the mountain he said was that its curved form\r\nmade it a perfect telescopic lens of great power. On going around to\r\nthe other side of the mountain he caught sight of the elk, which he\r\njudged must have been at least twenty-five miles away when he first saw\r\nit by the powerful glass-lens mountain!\r\n\r\nIn 1860-61 gold was discovered in Montana, and prospectors began to\r\nextend their search for the precious metal into adjoining territory. The\r\nIndians were troublesome; nevertheless many prospectors ventured into\r\nthe region of the Upper Yellowstone during the years succeeding, and\r\nreported seeing wonderful volcanic agencies at work.\r\n\r\nTo settle the many flying accounts about volcanic wonders in the\r\nYellowstone section, two expeditions headed by prominent citizens of\r\nMontana were formed to ascertain the truth concerning these statements.\r\nThe expeditions set out during the consecutive years 1869 and 1870. On\r\ntheir return excellent descriptions of what they had seen were published\r\nin the Montana papers, and these accounts were copied by the leading\r\npapers of the country.\r\n\r\nThe second, or Washburn-Doane, expedition of 1870 was the most\r\nsuccessful in its explorations, since it was provided with a military\r\nescort. One of the members of this expedition wrote up a series of\r\nexcellent articles which were published in _Scribner's Magazine_, thus\r\ngiving further authenticity and wide publicity to the discovery.\r\n\r\nIn 1871 interest awakened by the last expedition caused the United\r\nStates Government to send out a special expedition of geological and\r\nengineering men to collect exact data, take photographs, and make a\r\nsurvey of the Yellowstone region. The geological section was under the\r\ndirection of Dr. P. V. Hayden. Mainly through Hayden's influence and\r\nforesight Congress withdrew the tract now comprising Yellowstone\r\nNational Park from occupancy or sale, and dedicated and set it apart as\r\na public park or pleasure ground for the benefit and enjoyment of the\r\npeople. The bill was signed by the president March 1, 1872. In 1872 two\r\nUnited States geological surveying parties were sent out and detailed\r\nexplorations were made during the next ten years.\r\n\r\nThe park is now under the management of a military commander as acting\r\nsuperintendent, aided by a detachment of United States troops, who\r\nmaintain order, prevent acts of vandalism, and see that the rules and\r\nregulations of the park are obeyed. No one except the troops is allowed\r\nto bring firearms into the park, and the wild animals, now carefully\r\nprotected by law, have greatly multiplied. Through subsequent acts of\r\nCongress two forest reserves have been added to the park proper, the\r\nMadison Forest Reserve in 1902 and the Yellowstone Forest Reserve in\r\n1903. These additions make the total area reserved from settlement about\r\nseventeen thousand six hundred square miles.\r\n\r\nThe only living beings that are permitted to fell as many trees as they\r\nwish are the beavers, which use them in constructing their dams. The\r\ngrizzly and the black bear flourish in the park and have become quite\r\ntame. In the neighborhood of the camps and hotels they have become an\r\nintolerable nuisance because of their propensity to break into tents and\r\nbuildings in search of food.\r\n\r\nThe lordly elk nourishes here and numbers of them may be seen at almost\r\nany time of day. A herd of buffaloes is jealously protected, and food\r\nand shelter are provided for them during the winter when necessary.\r\nThese animals are increasing in numbers. Many antelope, deer, and\r\nmountain sheep are seen in the park.\r\n\r\nThe mountain lion and the coyote are two animals that the authorities of\r\nthe park feel justified in killing in order to preserve the other game,\r\nbut the wild ruggedness of the territory, which affords these pests\r\nample opportunity to multiply unmolested, prevents their extinction.\r\n\r\nDuring the fall of the year wild geese and ducks frequent the park in\r\ngreat numbers; some of the latter remain all winter long in places where\r\nthe hot springs keep the water of the streams from freezing. The United\r\nStates Fish Commission has taken special care in stocking the fishless\r\nstreams with trout, and now the Yellowstone Park furnishes the finest\r\ntrout-fishing in the whole world. Visitors to the park are granted full\r\nlicense to fish, but they must use only hook and line.\r\n\r\nAbout one-fifth of the reservation consists of tracts suited for\r\ngrazing, but for agricultural purposes the park is worthless, since\r\nfrosts occur every month of the year.\r\n\r\nThe forests consist of a variety of trees, but only one kind, the\r\nDouglas spruce, is suitable for good lumber. The quaking aspen is the\r\nonly deciduous tree that is abundant. Elk and deer browse about these\r\ntrees and keep them trimmed at a uniform distance from the ground.\r\n\r\nDuring the long rainless season the distant hills and mountains are\r\nbathed in an atmosphere of soft purple and blue in ever-varying\r\nintensity, while later in the season Jack Frost with his magic brush\r\npaints the mountain-sides with the most varied and gorgeous colors, and\r\nthe aspen changes to rich autumnal tints.\r\n\r\nAt the proper season Yellowstone Park is a vast garden of wild flowers\r\nwhich are dense and rich in colors even up to the snow line. Several\r\nvarieties of the lupine and the larkspur clothe the hillsides with every\r\nshade of color, while the modest violet seeks secluded spots in which to\r\nbloom. Forget-me-nots, geraniums, harebells, primroses, asters,\r\nsunflowers, anemones, roses, and many other plants are abundant.\r\n\r\nThe climate puts new life and energy into the visitor. Contrary to the\r\ngeneral opinion, the climatic conditions in the park are not extreme,\r\nnotwithstanding its high elevation. The average temperature at the\r\nMammoth Hot Springs in January, the coldest month, is 18° F., and in\r\nJuly, the hottest month, 61°. In the plateau regions, averaging fifteen\r\nhundred feet higher, the temperature is 8° in January and 51° in July.\r\n\r\nGood roads have been constructed throughout the park connecting all\r\npoints of interest, and in many instances these roads have been built at\r\nan enormous expense. The United States Government has already expended\r\nupward of one million dollars in road-making and bridge-building. There\r\nare now over sixty bridges and five hundred culverts to supplement the\r\nfive hundred miles of roads within the park proper and the forest\r\nreserves.\r\n\r\nWe enter the park from the north and then proceed to visit a few of the\r\nmost interesting places. Our tour embraces Mammoth Hot Springs, Norris\r\nGeyser Basin, Firehole Geyser Basins, Yellowstone Lake, and the Grand\r\nCanyon of Yellowstone River.\r\n\r\nLeaving the Northern Pacific train at Gardiner, the entrance station to\r\nthe park, we take a coach for Mammoth Hot Springs, five miles distant,\r\nand ride along the foaming, dashing Gardiner River through a canyon\r\nbearing the same name. Portions of the way unfold bold, picturesque\r\nscenery, giving a fitting introduction to the marvels and greater scenic\r\nbeauty that are in store for us. We cross the river four times on steel\r\nbridges within one mile.\r\n\r\nJust after crossing the last bridge we see an immense stream of hot\r\nwater issuing from an opening in the rocks and discharging directly into\r\nthe Gardiner River. This stream, the Boiling River, we are told, comes\r\nthrough subterranean channels from the famous Mammoth Hot Springs a mile\r\nand a half away.\r\n\r\nArriving at the springs, we find here a large, well-equipped hotel,\r\nwhere are also the administration head-quarters of the park. After\r\nresting a short time, we visit the world-renowned Hot Springs.\r\n\r\nThe Mammoth Hot Springs rise from the summit of a hill of limestone\r\nformation three hundred feet high, built by the deposit of mineral\r\nmatter held in solution by the hot water that issues from them. The\r\nterraces, containing upward of two hundred acres, are delicately tinted\r\nin beautiful shades of red, yellow, orange, brown, and purple. Those\r\nover which the water is still flowing present the most attractive\r\nappearance, the colors being fresh and rich; the others have dull, ashen\r\ncolors.\r\n\r\nCalcareous deposits are rapidly building up these terraces in various\r\nbeautiful forms, the edges of many being supported by delicate columns,\r\nsome of which resemble organ pipes. Different names are given to the\r\nterraces according to form or fancy, as Pulpit Terrace, Jupiter Terrace,\r\nNarrow Gauge Terrace, Minerva Terrace, etc.\r\n\r\nThe overhanging bowls built up by these deposits are exquisite specimens\r\nof Nature's work and are filled with water of wonderful transparency;\r\nwhile the variety of forms of these receptacles and their charming\r\ncolors fascinate the beholder.\r\n\r\nScattered over the formation in all directions are numberless\r\ncuriosities, such as the Devil's Kitchen, Cupid's Cave, and the Stygian\r\nCave. In many of these caves there is an accumulation of carbonic-acid\r\ngas sufficient to destroy animal life. This is especially true of the\r\nlatter cave.\r\n\r\nWe now journey by coach to Norris Geyser Basin. On the route we pass by\r\nObsidian Cliff, sometimes called Obsidian Mountain, which is an immense\r\nmass of black volcanic glass. This mineral was used by the Indians for\r\nmaking arrow-heads and spear-heads.\r\n\r\nIn constructing a road around the base of the cliff, great difficulty\r\nwas encountered on account of the hardness of the obsidian. The\r\nsuperintendent in charge of the work hit upon a happy device by which to\r\nquarry it. Log fires were built along the base, and when the volcanic\r\nglass was hot cold water was thrown upon it. This method cracked the\r\nmaterial into fragments which were easily removed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming Mammoth Hot\r\nSprings. Summit Pools]\r\n\r\nOpposite the base of Obsidian Cliff is Beaver Lake, the home of numerous\r\nbeavers and a great resort for waterfowl during a part of the year.\r\nAfter passing Obsidian Cliff, hot springs become more numerous until we\r\nreach Norris Geyser Basin. In this locality the odor of sulphur is\r\nstrong and unpleasant. A little farther on a loud roar startles us, and\r\na few moments later we see the cause of the explosion; it is a powerful\r\nsteam jet issuing from the summit of Roaring Mountain. When Dame Nature\r\n\"turns on steam\" there is no nonsense about it.\r\n\r\nNorris Basin seems to be of more recent volcanic development, since some\r\nof the steam vents in other basins have ceased action during the past\r\nfew years; moreover, several new ones have opened, one of which rivals\r\nRoaring Mountain. Constant and Minute-Man Geysers, though small, are\r\nfrequent and vigorous in action. In passing through this section the\r\nroad-bed is hot for some distance, showing that the subterranean rocks\r\nwhich heat the water cannot be very deep down in the earth.\r\n\r\nIn going to the Firehole Basins we follow Gibbon River to within four\r\nmiles of its mouth, then, crossing a point of land to the Firehole, we\r\nascend the right bank of the stream to Lower Basin. On the road we pass\r\nmany springs; the most conspicuous of which, Beryl Spring, lies close to\r\nthe road. It discharges a large volume of boiling water and the rising\r\nsteam frequently obscures the road.\r\n\r\nIn one locality outside the beaten track of tourists there is a\r\nveritable Hades on earth. Here, as we walk over ground that is very hot,\r\nwe are nearly suffocated by the fumes of sulphur. All around us are\r\nhundreds of seething, boiling vats of water, and the whole area is\r\ncracked and filled with holes from which noxious vapors rise.\r\n\r\nSoon after we leave this infernal region we hear a constant roar like\r\nthat coming from a large steamer about to leave its moorings. We follow\r\nin the direction from which the sound proceeds and at length discover\r\nthe cause.\r\n\r\nOn approaching the source of the sound we see a large volume of steam\r\nrushing with immense velocity from an opening in the ground, while the\r\nrock around the orifice is black as jet. The guide tells us that this\r\nhuge steam vent is called the Black Growler, and that it continues\r\nvigorously active summer and winter, year in and year out. Its roar can\r\nbe heard four miles away.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming Beehive Geyser]\r\n\r\nThe chief wonder of Lower Firehole Basin is the Great Fountain Geyser.\r\nIts formation is unique. At first sight one is led to believe that the\r\nbroad circular structure which he sees is artificial. On close\r\ninspection numerous pools, moulded and nicely ornamented, are seen sunk\r\nin this stone table, while in the centre there is a large and deep pool\r\nfilled with hot water, but looking like a beautiful spring. At the time\r\nof eruption this central pool of water is shot up to the height of one\r\nhundred feet or more. Near the Great Fountain Geyser is a small valley\r\nin the upper part of which is a large hot spring called the Firehole.\r\n\r\nWhen this spring is visited on a windless day, a light-colored flame\r\nseems to be constantly issuing from the bottom, flickering back and\r\nforth like a torch, and the visitor feels sure he is gazing at the\r\nhidden fires beneath that heat the water. It is the illusion caused by\r\nsuperheated steam escaping through a fissure in the rock and dividing\r\nthe water. The reflection from the surface thus formed and a black\r\nbackground formed by the sides and bottom of the pool account for the\r\nphenomenon.\r\n\r\nSurprise Pool is found near the Great Fountain; it will make good its\r\nname should you throw into it a handful of dirt. Excelsior Geyser, not\r\nfar away, is really a winter volcano, its crater being a seething\r\ncaldron near the Firehole River, into which it sends six million gallons\r\nof water each day, even when not in eruption.\r\n\r\nAt times it sends up a column of water, fifty feet in diameter, to the\r\nheight of two hundred and fifty feet. The eruptions take place at long\r\nintervals--seven to ten years. On account of the great depth and extent\r\nof this geyser it has sometimes been denominated \"Hell's Half-Acre.\"\r\n\r\nFollowing along Firehole River we pass into the Upper Basin, a section\r\nthe most popular with the majority of tourists. Among the geysers in\r\nthis basin we shall find Grotto, Castle, Giant, Giantess, Bee Hive,\r\nSplendid, Grand, and Old Faithful. Each of them has an interest\r\npeculiarly its own, but Old Faithful is always true to its name and is\r\nperhaps best appreciated by visitors.\r\n\r\nThe opening through which Old Faithful disgorges its water is at the\r\nsummit of a mound built up by its own exertions. The wrinkles on its\r\nface tell of long-continued service. Every seventy minutes this faithful\r\nworker sends up a column of water to the height of one hundred and\r\neighty feet, and at each eruption more than one million gallons of water\r\nare thrown out.\r\n\r\nWe now pass through a section noted for its wild and picturesque scenery\r\nand considered the pleasantest on the trip. In leaving the Upper Basin\r\nwe follow along Firehole River to the mouth of Spring Creek, then along\r\nthis creek to the Continental Divide. From there, travelling a few miles\r\nalong the Pacific slope, we cross the Divide and descend the mountains\r\ninto the valley of the Yellowstone.\r\n\r\nNear the central part of the park, encircled by a forest and elevated\r\nnearly eight thousand feet above the sea-level, lies a remarkable body\r\nof water supplied by ice-cold streams formed by the melting snow on the\r\nsurrounding mountains. This body of water, of which the Yellowstone\r\nRiver is the outlet, is the famous Yellowstone Lake, thirty miles long\r\nand twenty miles wide; it is filled with trout.\r\n\r\nHere the fisherman can catch hundreds of trout in a short time, but\r\nunfortunately most of them are afflicted with a parasitic disease,\r\nrendering them unfit for food. Researches have been made seeking the\r\ncause of the disease in order, if possible, to apply a remedy, but so\r\nfar to no purpose. It is conjectured that the superabundance of fish\r\ntogether with a dearth of suitable food lowers their vitality, thus\r\nrendering them liable to disease.\r\n\r\nYellowstone stands next to Lake Titicaca as the highest large body of\r\nwater in the world. The sunrise and sunset effects on the lake are most\r\nbeautiful. A steamer plies on the lake carrying mail and passengers. The\r\nbird life on this body of water and its shores is represented by swans,\r\ngeese, ducks, cranes, pelicans, curlews, herons, plovers, and snipe.\r\n\r\nFor beauty and grandeur the lower falls and canyon of the Yellowstone\r\nRiver are unsurpassed. A body of water seventy feet wide rushes forward\r\nwith impetuous speed and joyously takes a leap of more than three\r\nhundred feet to the rocks below, where, breaking into millions of\r\nparticles, it forms a great cloud of spray. The water then dashes on\r\nwith renewed vitality between the walls of a canyon fourteen hundred\r\nfeet deep, and most gorgeously painted by nature in such a variety and\r\nlavishness of tints that they defy the most skilful artist to reproduce\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAs one gazes from the edge of the chasm into and along the depths below,\r\nhe attempts in vain to measure the fulness and beauty of this handiwork\r\nof nature. He is too amazed for utterance and remains spellbound,\r\ncommuning only with himself and nature regarding the unfathomable\r\nsignificance of such marvels. When the famous painter, Thomas Moran,\r\ndesired to reproduce in colors on canvas this masterpiece of nature, he\r\ngathered his inspiration from Artist Point, and after he had finished\r\nthe celebrated painting which now adorns the Capitol at Washington, he\r\nacknowledged that the beautiful tints of the canyon were beyond the\r\nreach of human art.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone has no equal on the face of the\r\nglobe. With a breadth equal to its depth, this richly decorated canyon\r\nstands out unique among the world's wonders. Its beautiful panorama of\r\nstained walls, down which trickle streams of water which brighten the\r\ntints in some places and soften them in others, extends for a distance\r\nof three miles. The entire canyon is fifteen miles in length.\r\n\r\nA most interesting place to visit, but outside the itinerary of most\r\ntourists, is the Fossil, or Petrified, Forest. This section, especially\r\nattractive to the scientist, lies in the northeastern part of the park\r\njust north of Amethyst Mountain.\r\n\r\nTo one who can read Nature's books, a wondrous volume is open,\r\ndisclosing in its strata the hidden secrets of many by-gone geological\r\nages. Here on the north flank of the mountain are two thousand feet of\r\nstratifications. On the ledges, tier above tier and story above story,\r\nare seen the opal and agate stumps and trunks of twenty ancient forests,\r\nsome of the trunks being ten feet in diameter.\r\n\r\nWhat wonderful stories do they tell of life and death, of flood and\r\nvolcanic fire, ranging through the eons of the past! So perfect are\r\nthese petrifactions that the annual rings can be easily counted and even\r\nthe grain of the wood is plainly visible.\r\n\r\nAs one traverses this wonderland he is impressed by the evidence of the\r\nstupendous forces that lie smouldering beneath the crust of the earth.\r\nIt is not improbable that at some future time, by the further wrinkling\r\nor sinking of the surface of this part of the American continent, the\r\nslumbering volcanic fires may be awakened to new life and activity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTWO PREHISTORIC CEMETERIES--GIANT REPTILES AND GIANT TREES\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough reptiles appeared first in the period known as the\r\nCarboniferous Age, or age of plant life, they did not attain their\r\ngreatest development until Jurassic and Cretaceous times, when many were\r\nof prodigious size and ruled the world. The gigantic ichthyosaurs,\r\nmesosaurs, and dinosaurs held dominion over the sea and land, and the\r\nmonster flying reptile, the pterodactyl, over the air.\r\n\r\nAges ago a great inland sea embracing Wyoming and the surrounding region\r\noccupied the area east of the Rocky Mountains. For many years students\r\nof geology had found this section a fertile field for the study of rock\r\nformations and the collection of fossils; but not until 1898 was the\r\ngeological wonderland of central-south Wyoming discovered.\r\n\r\nThis discovery proved to be a graveyard of prehistoric monsters dating\r\nback probably several millions of years ago. Entombed in the rocks of\r\nthe Jurassic and Cretaceous periods, many lizard-like animals of\r\ngigantic size called saurians were found. Several fossil skeletons of\r\nthese animals have been chiselled out of the solid rocks and mounted in\r\nmuseums, the work entailing a vast amount of labor and expense. The\r\ndiscovery was made by Mr. Walter Granger, who had been sent out by the\r\nAmerican Museum of Natural History, of New York, to hunt for fossils.\r\n\r\nIn the desert section near Medicine Bow River, Wyoming, he found what\r\nseemed to be a number of dark-brown bowlders. On a critical examination\r\nthey proved to be ponderous fossils that had been washed out of a great\r\nbed of reptilian remains. The fossil graveyard in question was found to\r\nbe two hundred and seventy-five feet in thickness. Near by was a Mexican\r\nsheep-herder's cabin, the foundations of which were constructed of huge\r\nfossils. The vicinity was christened Bone Cabin Quarry. Ten miles south\r\nof the Bone Cabin Quarry, in the Como Bluffs, another bed containing the\r\nremains of huge dinosaurs was discovered. From these remarkable\r\ncemeteries many fossils have been obtained.\r\n\r\nThe term saurian means \"lizard,\" and it has many prefixes to indicate\r\nthe different genera and species. The prefixes generally express to a\r\ncertain extent the characteristic appearance or habits of the different\r\nkinds of saurians. Some were flesh-eaters; others were herbivorous. Some\r\nlived on land; others, in the shallow waters and lagoons, fed on\r\nsucculent aquatic plants; still others frequented the deeper waters and\r\nlived on fish.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Property of the American Museum of Natural History_\r\nThe Brontosaurus (herbivorous dinosaur)]\r\n\r\nThe name dinosaur, meaning terrible lizard, represents an order of\r\nfossil reptiles. They are allied to the crocodile, but, like the\r\nkangaroo, their hind legs were much longer than their front ones. The\r\nneck and tail were very long and the body short but of immense size.\r\nThese monsters were from twenty to eighty feet in length and weighed\r\nfrom thirty to one hundred tons. The long, slender neck supported a\r\nsmall head that contained a correspondingly small brain, from which it\r\nis thought that the creature possessed a low order of intelligence. The\r\ntail was much thicker than the neck and in some species was flattened.\r\nWhen rising on its hind legs and resting on its tail it could look into\r\nthe window of a four-story building. Some of these strange animals had\r\nbills like those of a duck; some possessed teeth for grinding and others\r\nsharp teeth for tearing. These were by far the largest land animals that\r\never lived. The different species often waged titanic battles with one\r\nanother for the supremacy of the earth.\r\n\r\nIt is conjectured that their disappearance was due to violent upheavals\r\nof the earth, to the draining of the water, to changes of climate, and\r\nto deprivation of suitable food.\r\n\r\nThe mounted brontosaur in the American Museum of Natural History, New\r\nYork, will enable one better to appreciate the size of these giants of\r\nthe ancient world. This typical specimen, though not the largest found,\r\nis sixty-seven feet long and stands fifteen and one-half feet high. Its\r\nneck measures thirty feet in length and its tail eighteen. The body\r\nweighed about ninety tons. This huge fossil, enclosed in its stone\r\nmatrix, was sent from the quarry to the museum. After it had been\r\nreceived two men were employed constantly for nearly two and one-half\r\nyears in removing the matrix, repairing, and mounting the fossil.\r\n\r\nLet us turn now to the burying ground of a giant forest. Long, long\r\nyears ago, before man appeared on the earth, an inland sea occupied what\r\nis now the northeastern part of Arizona. It was a sea bordered with\r\nsandstone and surrounded by coniferous forests, where stately trees\r\nnodded in the breezes.\r\n\r\nAt length there came a great change. The rim of the basin gave way, and\r\nthe great volume of water, freed from restraint, overwhelmed the forest\r\nwith earthy material, prostrating and burying it deep beneath the flood\r\nof sand.\r\n\r\nIn time the woody structure disappeared, and was replaced by beautifully\r\nstained opal and agate. Again, in the lapse of time the old forest bed\r\nwas once more lifted above its former level, forming a mesa, or plateau,\r\nof considerable extent. During subsequent ages, the elements scarred and\r\nfurrowed the plateau, forming canyons, gulches, valleys, and buttes,\r\nthus revealing in part this ancient forest. Could these dead trees but\r\ntalk, how interesting would be their story! We can read their history\r\nbut imperfectly by examining the mutilated breast of Mother Earth, in\r\nand on which lie these mute stone trees, dead yet made more beautiful\r\nthrough their transformation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Property of the American Museum of Natural History_\r\nThe Allosaurus (carnivorous dinosaur)]\r\n\r\nThis region is called the \"Petrified Forest,\" or \"Chalcedony Park.\" It\r\nis about one hundred square miles in extent, and is visited annually by\r\nthousands of people from all parts of the world. On account of its\r\nstrange geological character it is of special interest to the scientist.\r\n\r\nLet us make a brief trip to this wonderful stone forest. We take light\r\nhand-baggage and board a Santa Fé train. The railway passes near the\r\nmost interesting part of the forest, and we change cars before entering\r\nArizona in order to take this line. The railway officials have made a\r\nstation at Adamana, six miles from the edge of the forest, in order to\r\naccommodate the travelling public. We leave the train here and procure a\r\nteam to carry us to the forest.\r\n\r\nUnless informed of what is to be seen one is apt to be greatly\r\ndisappointed. One's idea of a forest is usually that of a timber-covered\r\narea in which the trees stand erect, with outspreading branches; but we\r\nlook in vain for a standing tree, or even a stump that is erect.\r\n\r\nAll are branchless trunks, prostrate on the ground, many wholly or\r\npartly buried; moreover, they are lying in all sorts of positions, some\r\nentire and others broken into sections; some are massed closely\r\ntogether; others lie apart; and millions of pieces of all sizes are\r\nscattered around. At places we can travel a long distance by stepping\r\nfrom one log to another.\r\n\r\nBut what is that pile of variegated disk-like objects looking like the\r\nprimitive Mexican ox-cart wheels? They are cross-sections of stone logs,\r\nsome large and some small, seemingly thrown together carelessly. It is a\r\ncharacteristic of petrified trunks to break into cross-sections or\r\nblocks, varying from a few inches to several feet in length; and this\r\ntendency prevails here.\r\n\r\nWe are told that the trees of this forest antedate those of the\r\nYellowstone Park by a long period of time. How the loftiest flights of\r\nthe imagination are piqued as we contemplate the marvellous changes\r\nsince this primeval forest depended on the soil and sun for their\r\nlife-giving elements! As we wander through this wonderful forest our\r\nfeet seem to be treading on the rarest gems. And well may it seem so,\r\nbecause when polished these pieces display a beauty of coloring and a\r\nlustre that rivals the glint of precious stones. There is no other\r\npetrified forest in the world in which the mineralized wood assumes so\r\nmany varied and interesting forms and colors.\r\n\r\nMany years ago a firm at Sioux Falls undertook to manufacture table\r\ntops, mantels, pedestals, and various decorative articles out of\r\nsections of this agatized wood by cutting them into the desired forms\r\nand polishing them. Tiffany and Company, the famous jewellers, also used\r\nthis material for the base of the beautiful silver testimonial presented\r\nto the French sculptor, Bartholdi.\r\n\r\nAt a later date, an abrasive company of Denver conceived the plan of\r\ngrinding up these trunks to make emery because of their extreme\r\nhardness; in fact, a plant was shipped to Adamana station for that\r\npurpose. Fortunately for the public, however, it was not put into\r\noperation because the company learned that a Canadian firm had put on\r\nthe market an article at such a reduced price that to grind up these\r\nbeautiful logs would be unprofitable.\r\n\r\nFragments, branches, and trunks of all sorts and sizes are found lying\r\naround, many of them richly colored, forming chalcedony, opal, and\r\nagate; some approach the condition of jasper and onyx.\r\n\r\nBefore the Petrified Forest was set aside as a national park by\r\nCongress, many acts of vandalism were committed, to say nothing about\r\nthe quantities of mineral carried away by manufacturing firms and\r\ncuriosity-hunters. Keepers now have charge of the park, and no one is\r\npermitted to take away specimens for commercial use. Previously many of\r\nthe finest logs were destroyed by blasting in order to procure the\r\nbeautiful crystals which are found in the centre of many of them.\r\n\r\nOne object of special interest in the park is the National Bridge, a\r\npetrified trunk which spans a chasm thirty feet wide and twenty feet\r\ndeep. The part of the trunk crossing the gulch lies diagonally and is\r\nforty-four feet long. The length of the trunk exposed by erosion is one\r\nhundred and eleven feet; a fraction still remains embedded in the\r\nsandstone.\r\n\r\nThe ruins of several ancient Indian pueblos are scattered about the\r\npark, nearly all of them built of logs of this richly colored, agatized\r\nwood. The forest was a storehouse for ages, whence primitive men\r\nobtained material from which to make agate hammers, arrow-heads, and\r\nknives, as is shown by implements found hundreds of miles distant from\r\nthese quarries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nDEATH VALLEY\r\n\r\n\r\nDeath Valley, or the Arroyo del Muerte, as the Spanish called it, is in\r\nthe western part of southern California, near the oblique boundary of\r\nNevada, a little way north of Nevada's vanishing point. Nowadays one may\r\nride almost into the valley in a Pullman coach. From Daggett, a forsaken\r\nstation of the Santa Fé Railroad, a \"jerkwater\" road, as it is called,\r\nextends northward to Goldfield and Tonopah, and this road takes one\r\nalmost as the crow flies to the edge of the valley of the ominous name.\r\n\r\nEven in a Pullman coach the trip is trying to both body and soul. But\r\nforty years ago?--well, that is a different story. Then there was no\r\nSanta Fé Railway, and no Daggett--just a wide stretch of desert dotted\r\nwith yucca and Spanish bayonet. Prospectors and pack-trains had left\r\ntrails here and there. One of these, now a wagon-road, lay southward to\r\nSan Bernardino; northward it lost itself in the desert toward\r\nCandelaria.\r\n\r\nThe region possesses some names that are a trifle paradoxical. For\r\ninstances, there are the Black Mountains, the grayish red color of which\r\nbelies their name. Then there is Funeral Range, which, far from being\r\nsombre in aspect, is most brilliantly colored. To the southward is\r\nParadise Valley, a plain desert strewn with greasewood and chamiso; and\r\ndown in the floor of Death Valley is, or rather was, Greenland. But\r\nGreenland is not a waste of icebound coldness; on the contrary, it is\r\naverred by the laborers in the borax fields to be several degrees hotter\r\nthan any other place on earth. The surplus water of the spring is\r\nemployed to produce verdure there, and it is apparently equal to the\r\ntask, for the forty or more acres so irrigated produce wonderful crops;\r\nhence it is \"Greenland.\"\r\n\r\nEven twenty years ago the trip to Death Valley was a trying one to the\r\nexperienced desert traveller in summer; to the tenderfoot without a\r\nguide it was almost certain death. The best equipment for the trip was a\r\npair of mules, or else cayuse ponies, and a light buckboard with broad\r\ntires--tires so wide that they would not sink in the loose, wind-blown\r\nrock waste. The equipment might possibly be found in Daggett; more\r\nlikely it must be purchased in San Bernardino.\r\n\r\nAt all events, Daggett was the real starting point, and the first\r\n\"trick\" in the journey was the crossing of Mohave River. The river was\r\npretty sure to be deep--not with water but with sand. Whoever saw water\r\nin the channel, or \"wash,\" of the Mohave? Perhaps the oldest settler may\r\nhave seen it; at any rate he will so claim, for the oldest settler is\r\nalways boastful; indeed, fairy-story telling is his inherent, bounden\r\nright. To make good his assertion he points to the bridge, and certainly\r\nthe bridge is there; but as for the river, it may be on hand one\r\nday--perhaps an hour or so--in ten, twenty, or thirty years!\r\n\r\nBeyond the river a wide expanse of desert is before us, and then a\r\nbeautiful lake comes into view. Real water, is it?--no; just the desert\r\nmirage, but it seems real enough to quench a genuine thirst. But the\r\nillusion is lessened by the surroundings, for we are approaching a dry\r\nsink--an old lake-bed that was filled with brackish water once when a\r\ncloud-burst that occurred in Calico Mountains had its busy day.\r\n\r\nBack of us are Calico Mountains, a picturesque clump of buttes, and the\r\nglimpse of them we get from the north explains why they were so named.\r\nAnd such colors! Their brilliant hues change like kaleidoscopic patterns\r\nwith the sun's motion. On our right a trail diverges to Coyote Holes,\r\nmade grewsome by one of many tragedies that have occurred in the region.\r\nThis time it was a hold-up. A desert waif out of luck and ready cash\r\nwaylaid the paymaster of Calico mines and relieved him of the money\r\nintended for the miners. The robber was soon trailed and he quickly\r\ndiscovered that his only safety lay in hiding. But where could he hide\r\nin that desolate flat?\r\n\r\nAt Coyote Holes there is a spring and a small marsh. The robber buried\r\nhimself in the mud till all but his face was covered and lay there while\r\nthe posse searched. But the keen vision of an Indian scout did not fail.\r\nWhen the robber saw that he was surrounded, he put up a brave fight and\r\nwent down, riddled with rifle-balls. The money was recovered.\r\n\r\nA little farther on is Garlic Springs. It is a common camping-place and\r\nlike other camps is plentifully strewn with the evidence of the\r\nprospector's outfit--hundreds and hundreds of empty tin cans. In time we\r\ncamp at Cave Springs in a little cove of the Avawatz Buttes. Once there\r\ncame along a man who all said was half-witted. Perhaps he was, but his\r\nintelligence was keen enough to prompt him to claim the springs. By\r\nselling the water for quenching thirst at the rate of \"four bits\" a head\r\nfor stock and \"two bits\" apiece for men, his spring proved the best gold\r\nmine in the district.\r\n\r\nThere is no water ahead until we reach Saratoga Springs, a dozen miles\r\nbeyond, and it is well that we take a small supply along, as the water\r\nthere is unfit for either man or beast. There is a difference between\r\nSaratoga Springs, New York, and the springs bearing this high-sounding\r\nname in the Amargosa sink.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Twenty-mule borax team]\r\n\r\nBoiling Springs are a night's ride--perhaps twenty miles--beyond. We\r\ngive our team three hours of rest and start therefor, stopping in the\r\nmean time for a midnight feed, where most unexpectedly we find some\r\nexcellent grazing for our horses. By daylight we are at the Springs and\r\nin a locality much like the Bad Lands of South Dakota. But the \"boiling\"\r\nindustry apparently is taking a vacation, for the water is not too warm\r\nfor one's hands and face--and certainly it is refreshing.\r\n\r\nWe are in a \"sink,\" or the dry bed of a lake, and the cliffs of clay\r\nhave been sculptured into existence by the Amargosa River. Sometimes,\r\nwhen a dissipated cloud tumbles its contents into the region, the\r\nAmargosa is filled bank full with water; but few prospectors have seen\r\nmore than a trickling stream flowing in its bed.\r\n\r\nWe turn our way out of the wagon-trail toward Funeral Range to find the\r\ncanyon of Furnace Creek, and in time we are clambering up a narrow gulch\r\nbetween the multicolored strata of clay buttes. Not a vestige of life,\r\nnot even the horned-toad or the trail of the kangaroo-rat is to be seen.\r\nHalf a dozen graves marked each by a wooden cross or a rock monument are\r\nin sight. Who are they? Ask the simoom that sweeps like a cruel furnace\r\nblast over this forsaken region. To be lost in this desert means\r\nhorrible suffering, phantom-seeing, and then death. The bodies of these\r\nunfortunates were merely found and buried--lost!--dead!\r\n\r\nWe cross the mesa which forms part of the Funeral Range. Telescope and\r\nSentinel Peaks beyond Death Valley in the Panamint Mountains loom above\r\nthe horizon; we descend the canyon of Furnace Creek and are in Death\r\nValley.\r\n\r\nWe are in a strange and weird depression of the earth's crust about\r\nfifty miles long and ten wide, the deepest part of which is more than\r\ntwo hundred and fifty feet below sea level. Once upon a time, it is\r\nthought, the Gulf of California reached so far inland that it included\r\nthis gash. Then the never-ceasing winds bridged it with loose rock\r\nwaste. Thus, Death Valley was born. In time it became a salt lake, a\r\nmarsh, and then a dry sink.\r\n\r\nIt is here that the deadly side-winder travels by night instead of day\r\nto avoid the excessive heat, and rivers flow with their bottoms up as if\r\nto hide from the burning rays of the sun; where Death by name and by\r\nnature gives forth no warning note, and even a mountain range on the\r\neast side of the valley signifies the service held to commemorate the\r\nlast resting-place of the unfortunates who have perished here.\r\n\r\nThe valley is hemmed in on the east by the precipitous side of the\r\ngorgeous-colored Funeral Range, and on the west by the Panamint\r\nMountains, which rise to the height of ten thousand feet. The climate is\r\ncool and salubrious in winter, but is a fiery furnace in summer, when\r\nthe mercury in the thermometer sometimes climbs to one hundred and forty\r\ndegrees in the shade.\r\n\r\nDeath Valley gained its name from a terrible tragedy that occurred\r\nduring the early days of the gold excitement in California. Emigrants\r\nbound for California overland were wont to follow the same general route\r\nas far as Salt Lake City. From here there were two routes, one westerly\r\nalong the route over which the Central Pacific Railway was afterward\r\nbuilt, the other southerly into southern California.\r\n\r\nLate in the season of 1849 one of the emigrant parties reached Salt Lake\r\nCity. Rather than winter there, however, they determined to push forward\r\nat all hazards by the southern route. After travelling through Utah and\r\nsome distance in Nevada, they left the regular trail and decided to turn\r\nsouthwesterly and cross a fairly level mesa. The region was unknown to\r\nthem, but they believed that by thus changing the route they would be\r\nable to reach their destination more quickly. They also thought that\r\nthey would find better grazing for their stock. After they had crossed\r\nthe mesa, the route became more rugged and more precipitous, so, in\r\norder to lighten the wagon-loads, one by one many articles of furniture\r\nwere left behind.\r\n\r\nWhen the company reached the head of Amargosa Valley they began to\r\nseparate. At length one party found looming up before it the streaked\r\nand many-colored Funeral Range of mountains. Nothing daunted, they\r\nlaboriously toiled up to the crest with their teams. On looking down\r\ntheir hearts sank within them as they beheld a precipitous descent to a\r\nlong, deep, and narrow valley almost destitute of vegetation. This\r\ndepression was to be christened Death Valley.\r\n\r\nIt was now too late to turn back; so, unyoking the oxen, they proceeded\r\nto lower the wagons down into the valley by hand, using chains and\r\nropes. By the time they had finished the task darkness had shut down\r\nand, gathering sufficient greasewood brush to make a fire, they cooked\r\ntheir evening meal with a scanty supply of water and vainly searched for\r\nmore. The food was eaten in gloomy silence, for they were lost and knew\r\nnot where they were nor how to reach the nearest settlement.\r\n\r\nIt was apparent to all, however, that they must hasten to leave this\r\nkiln-dried desert valley as soon as possible. Abandoning their wagons\r\nand nearly all of the surviving oxen to their fate, after incredible\r\nhardships from lack of both food and water, about one-half of the\r\ncompany of thirty souls that crossed the Funeral Range reached the\r\nsettlements alive. Succumbing to their sufferings, the others dropped,\r\none by one, by the wayside unknelled and uncoffined. The skeletons of\r\nseveral of these unfortunate emigrants were found years afterward by\r\nexploring parties and prospectors.\r\n\r\nAmong those who escaped was a man named Bennett, who, on reaching the\r\nnearest town, reported that he had found a ledge of pure silver. The\r\nreputed discovery occurred in this way. As he was wending his course\r\nalong one of the canyons he came across a spring, and, being both\r\nthirsty and tired, after taking a drink sat down to rest. While sitting\r\nthere he carelessly broke off a piece of a rock jutting out near him,\r\nand perceiving that it was very heavy and thinking it might be of some\r\nvalue, placed a small part of it in his pocket.\r\n\r\nAfter he had reached San Bernardino he happened to purchase a gun\r\nlacking a front sight. Bennett therefore sought a gunsmith, whom he\r\nrequested to make a sight out of the metallic rock which he had found\r\nthat he might have a souvenir which would not be easily lost.\r\n\r\nTo the astonishment of all who learned the facts, the metal proved to\r\nbe pure silver. This circumstance gave rise to the celebrated \"Gunsight\r\nLead,\" a phantom that was chased in every direction from Death Valley;\r\nbut, like the mirage of the desert, the lead was never found.\r\n\r\nIn summer the valley is said to be the hottest place on the face of the\r\nearth, and persons deprived of water even for an hour become insane. Men\r\nwho have attempted to cross it at mid-day have been known to fall dead,\r\nand birds flying across have been killed by the fierce heat.\r\n\r\nCloud-bursts occur occasionally on the adjoining mountains, when\r\ntorrents pour down the declivities, filling the canyons with streams of\r\nwater sometimes many feet deep, which sweep everything before them. A\r\ncloud-burst may change the whole face of the mountain. Cloud-bursts come\r\nusually in the hottest weather and almost with the suddenness of an\r\nexplosion. A swiftly moving black cloud tipped with fiery streaks and\r\ngrowing rapidly appears above the crest of the mountains. Then it sinks\r\nlike a monster balloon turned sidewise until it strikes a ridge or peak;\r\nthe flood is then let loose and destruction follows.\r\n\r\nMany stories are told of persons barely escaping with their lives by\r\nhastily climbing up the side of the canyons, beyond the reach of the\r\nroaring waters, and of others being overwhelmed and drowned. Such a\r\nflood, caused by a cloud-burst, may have buried the alleged Gunsight\r\nLead and have changed the conformation of the canyon beyond recognition.\r\n\r\nNo one without experience in travelling over deserts in the summer\r\nseason can realize the hardships attending travel in the region of Death\r\nValley nor the sombre sameness of the arid stretches of sand. When the\r\nsun has set and the full moon rising makes the silhouettes of the\r\nmountains look darker, a vague, indescribable sensation comes over\r\none--an awe-inspiring feeling of insignificance and helplessness amidst\r\nscenes of majestic desolation. If religiously inclined, one is prone to\r\nutter the words of the wandering Arab of the Sahara, \"Nothing exists\r\nhere but Allah! _Allah hu Akbar!_--God is greater than all his created\r\nwitnesses.\" In summer, the air being almost entirely destitute of\r\nmoisture, evaporation is exceedingly rapid, and so hot is the sun at\r\nthis season that metal objects lying out-of-doors burn the hand if\r\ntouched.\r\n\r\nMany years ago valuable borax deposits were discovered in the Death\r\nValley and thousands of tons of borax have been freighted out by huge\r\nwagons drawn by mules; indeed, \"twenty-mule-team borax\" has become\r\nalmost a household term. Borax is still mined here, but not so\r\nextensively as formerly, more accessible borax deposits having been\r\nfound in Nevada and elsewhere--and the twenty-mule team is now a\r\nmotor-truck!\r\n\r\nNearly one-third of all of the borax of the world comes from the deserts\r\nof California and Nevada. When borax was first discovered in California\r\nthe wholesale price in New York was about fifty cents a pound; now it is\r\nabout six cents.\r\n\r\nThe various applications of borax to industrial and domestic uses have\r\nkept pace with its enormous production during the last twenty-five\r\nyears, until now it is used for more than fifty different purposes. The\r\nmeat-packers of the United States alone use several million pounds as a\r\npreservative. It is also used with excellent results as an antiseptic in\r\ndressing wounds and sores.\r\n\r\nFurnace Creek enters the valley on the eastern side of Death Valley, but\r\nits waters soon sink out of sight. The creek is used to irrigate a tract\r\nof alfalfa, a small garden, and a few trees; and the small ranch, a\r\nveritable oasis in a desert, is rightly called Greenland. A few men are\r\nkept employed here by the borax company. Now and then, however, the\r\nwhole crowd, tiring of the extreme heat, desert in a body.\r\n\r\nThis region is now robbed of some of its terrors by the completion of\r\nthe Tonopah and Tidewater Railroad, which touches Death Valley at the\r\nold Amargosa Borax Works.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE MINERAL WEALTH OF THE ANDES\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this period of the world's progress, when so many marvellous\r\ninventions are taking place, one can scarcely realize the intense\r\ninterest that was awakened by the first discoveries made in the New\r\nWorld. So great was the excitement that the most improbable stories were\r\nreadily believed.\r\n\r\nThere were fountains of perpetual youth, Amazonian warriors, mighty\r\ngiants, and rivers whose beds sparkled with gems and golden pebbles. The\r\nreports of every returning adventurer, whatever had been his luck, were\r\ntinged with the marvellous. In fact, a world of romance was now open to\r\nall and the opportunities to achieve fame and fortune were numberless.\r\nThe first in the field stood the best chance to win the choicest prizes.\r\nStories that outrivalled the Arabian Nights clouded the realm of reason.\r\n\r\nSo extraordinary were the accounts that many of the cities of Spain were\r\ndepleted of their most energetic men. Every craft that could sail the\r\nseas was called into use, and the building of new vessels was hastened\r\nto completion in order to provide for the needs of adventurous\r\nprospectors and would-be explorers.\r\n\r\nThe conquest of the Aztec Empire, with its millions of treasure, by\r\nCortez had already proved the valiancy of Spanish cavaliers. To add to\r\nthis, the conquest of the Incas by Pizarro and his followers was\r\nregarded a miracle of divine interposition.\r\n\r\nAs a result, Spanish galleons laden with treasure from the conquered\r\ncountries ploughed the seas, and untold wealth poured into private and\r\nroyal coffers. Spanish ambition and greed for gold knew no bounds.\r\nCunning and cruelty were employed by the Spaniards to secure their ends.\r\nNo trials, no hardships were too great for them to endure. No perils\r\ndaunted them. Western South America, ruled by viceroys for nearly three\r\ncenturies, brought to Spain its greatest wealth. One-fifth of all the\r\nwealth and treasure acquired was reserved for the crown.\r\n\r\nWhen Pizarro first visited the interior of Peru he found an empire well\r\nadvanced in the arts of civilization. Its temples within and without\r\nwere richly decorated with gold. There were thousands of miles of\r\nexcellent roads, of which two were used for military purposes. One of\r\nthese extended along the lowlands; the other traversed the grand\r\nplateau. These roads crossed ravines bridged with solid masonry and were\r\npierced by tunnels cut through solid rock. The construction of these\r\ngreat roads was a more wonderful achievement than the building of the\r\nEgyptian pyramids.\r\n\r\nThe government was systematically organized and to a certain extent it\r\nwas both paternal and communal. Agriculture was skilfully carried on by\r\nmeans of fertilization and irrigation.\r\n\r\nThe sun was the chief deity and object of worship of its people. Their\r\nmost beautifully adorned and renowned sanctuary was the Temple of the\r\nSun at Cuzco. Besides this sacred edifice there were several hundred\r\ninferior temples and places of worship scattered through the empire, all\r\nplentifully ornamented with gold and silver. Every Inca ruler was\r\nregarded as a descendant of the sun and therefore a sacred person.\r\n\r\nAccording to the popular belief, gold consisted of tears wept by the sun\r\nand was therefore a sacred metal suitable for beautifying the palaces of\r\nthe Incas and temples of worship. Not only were the edifices themselves\r\nrichly adorned with this precious metal, but the sacred vessels and many\r\nof the articles of furniture were made of the same material. Silver,\r\nalso, was much used, but was not considered sacred. So great was the\r\namount of the precious metals used that each royal palace and temple was\r\na veritable mine.\r\n\r\nFrom 1520 to 1525 reports of a rich empire at the south were circulated\r\namong the adventurers congregated at Panama. At length they were\r\nconfirmed in a great measure by travellers who had voyaged southward\r\nalong the coast. Francisco Pizarro, a restless spirit who had been\r\nassociated with Balboa and others in discovery and exploration,\r\ndetermining to test the truth of these reports, made several voyages\r\nsouth.\r\n\r\nFinally, he landed on the shores of Peru with an army of followers who\r\nnumbered less than two hundred. He met with but little opposition from\r\nthe natives while marching toward the interior, and although he\r\nplundered some of the places through which he passed, the people\r\nreceived him with marks of friendship.\r\n\r\nIn some instances towns of several thousand population were deserted on\r\nthe approach of the Spaniards, so great was the terror inspired by the\r\nwhite men, especially by those on horseback. At first it was the policy\r\nof the invaders to treat the natives with kindness in order to\r\naccomplish their purpose, namely, to conquer the Peruvian Empire in the\r\nsame manner that Cortez had conquered the Aztecs. They were accompanied\r\nby two of the natives who previously had been taken to Spain and taught\r\nthe Spanish language. By this means the Spaniards were able to\r\ncommunicate with the people.\r\n\r\nLearning that the Inca ruler, Atahuallpa, was encamped with his army\r\namong the mountains, Pizarro sent an embassy to request a meeting with\r\nhim. It was agreed that they meet at Caxamalca, a strongly fortified\r\ncity among the sierras. On arriving at the city, the Spaniards found it\r\nevacuated. Soon after taking up their quarters there, Atahuallpa arrived\r\nand established his camp a short distance outside the city.\r\n\r\nPizarro at once sent word to Atahuallpa to come into the city and sup\r\nwith him, but asked that, in order to show his faith in the white men\r\nand his own good intentions, he should leave all weapons behind. After\r\nmuch persuasion Atahuallpa accepted the invitation and entered the city,\r\nwith several thousand of his followers, unarmed.\r\n\r\nWhen fairly within the enclosure, a priest approaching the Inca ruler\r\nmade a harangue about Christianity and demanded that he should submit to\r\nthe authority of the Spanish king.\r\n\r\n\"By what authority do you demand such submission?\" replied the monarch\r\nwith flashing eye.\r\n\r\n\"By this holy book which I hold in my hand,\" answered the priest.\r\n\r\nThen snatching the volume from the hand of the priest, Atahuallpa\r\nscornfully threw it on the ground, saying, \"What right have you in my\r\ncountry? I will call you and your companions to an account for the\r\nindignities heaped upon me.\"\r\n\r\nPicking up the book, the priest forthwith went to Pizarro and reported\r\nthe conduct of the Inca, saying, \"It is useless to talk to this dog. At\r\nthem at once; I absolve you.\"\r\n\r\nImmediately Pizarro raised his handkerchief for the preconcerted\r\nsignal, the firing of a gun. Thereupon his soldiers, infantry and\r\ncavalry, rushed from their places of concealment upon the defenceless\r\nIndians, slaughtering them unmercifully right and left.\r\n\r\nThe discharge of the arquebuses and cannon, with their smoke, and the\r\ncharge of the cavalry paralyzed the unsuspecting natives, and the attack\r\nbecame a horrible massacre. Not until thousands of the Indians had been\r\nkilled and the Inca ruler had been captured did darkness cause the\r\nSpaniards to desist from their bloody work. So sudden and terrible had\r\nbeen the onslaught that the haughty monarch himself seemed stunned by\r\nthe effect.\r\n\r\nRealizing the irresistible power of the white men with their wonderful\r\nweapons and horses, the natives gave up for a time all thoughts of\r\nresistance. In fact, they regarded the Spaniards as superior beings\r\nendowed with preternatural gifts.\r\n\r\nWhen the ruler had been kept a prisoner several months, he desired to\r\nregain his freedom. By this time he realized the Spaniards' thirst for\r\ngold, and therefore promised to fill the room in which he was confined\r\nwith it as high as he could reach, and twice to fill an adjoining room\r\nwith silver, if they would release him.\r\n\r\nPizarro agreed to this proposal; Atahuallpa thereupon sent out\r\nmessengers to all parts of his empire requesting that the metals in the\r\nshape of utensils and ornaments be collected from the royal palaces,\r\ntemples, and elsewhere and brought to Caxamalca.\r\n\r\nOn account of the difficulty of transportation, since all the treasure\r\nhad to be carried on the backs of the natives, many months elapsed\r\nbefore the collections could be made.\r\n\r\nWhen fifteen and one-half million dollars' worth of gold and a large\r\namount of silver had been delivered at Caxamalca, Pizarro excused the\r\nimprisoned ruler from further contributions. At this juncture of\r\naffairs Almagro, a co-partner in the Peruvian expedition, arrived on the\r\nscene with a strong reinforcement.\r\n\r\nOn learning of the immense amount of gold and silver collected, the\r\nfollowers of both leaders loudly clamored for its distribution among\r\nthem, and, taking out the royal fifth part, the remainder was divided\r\naccording to the rank and service rendered. Then came rumors of an\r\nuprising among the natives and of the collection of an army to drive out\r\nthe invaders, but on investigation these reports were found to be false.\r\n\r\nThe question then uppermost in the minds of the Spanish leaders was the\r\ndisposition of the royal prisoner. It was thought that, were he released\r\naccording to promise, the natives might rally around him and demand the\r\nexpulsion of the intruders. So it was decided to make charges against\r\nhim and to have at least the form of a trial in order to give an\r\nappearance of justice to the proceedings.\r\n\r\nTwelve charges were made against Atahuallpa, nearly all of which were\r\nfar-fetched and absolutely false. He was found guilty and condemned to\r\ndeath by burning; but at the last moment, when he was chained to a stake\r\nand the torch was ready to be applied, the priest in attendance promised\r\nthat the sentence should be commuted to the easier death by the garrote\r\nif he would renounce his idolatry and embrace Christianity. He assented\r\nto the proposal, and immediately the modified sentence was carried out.\r\nIt is not necessary to add that the execution of the Peruvian monarch\r\nwas the darkest stain on the pages of Spanish colonial history. From\r\nthis time on the conduct of the Spanish invaders was marked by a most\r\ninhuman cruelty toward the natives.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Oroya Railroad, Peru, showing four sections of the\r\nroad]\r\n\r\nThinking that he could more easily govern the empire through a native\r\nruler subservient to himself, Pizarro placed Manco, the true heir, on\r\nthe Peruvian throne. In the meantime, however, parts of the empire\r\nrebelled against the new ruler and the Spanish usurpers. Then, when the\r\nrebellious tribes had been brought back to their former allegiance, the\r\nSpanish leaders quarrelled and fought among themselves.\r\n\r\nIt was not long before the arrogant and cruel conduct of the Spaniards\r\nalienated all friendship on the part of both ruler and his subjects.\r\nManco broke from his masters and, aided by his people, raised the\r\nstandard of rebellion, determining to make a last supreme effort to rid\r\nhis subjects of the incubus that was sapping the life of the country.\r\n\r\nAfter many bloody encounters in which both sides sustained severe\r\nlosses, Manco was killed and the Spanish yoke was firmly fixed on the\r\nneck of the people, who for the greater part were consigned to a most\r\ninhuman slavery. Thousands perished by the brutal treatment inflicted\r\nupon them in the silver mines.\r\n\r\nIn the course of time Indian slavery was abolished in a great measure by\r\nroyal proclamation; nevertheless, Spain continued to rule this land for\r\nthree hundred years before the oppressive yoke was cast off by a\r\nsuccessful uprising. It is a pleasure to know that many of the Spanish\r\nleaders who were guilty of this heartless cruelty suffered violent\r\ndeaths in quarrels among themselves or in rebellion against the crown of\r\nSpain.\r\n\r\nDuring the period of Spanish rule an immense revenue accrued from\r\nworking the rich silver mines. Those that filled the Spanish treasure\r\nships so eagerly sought by buccaneers were the mines of Potosi. These\r\nsilver lodes, extensively worked through Indian slave labor by Hernando\r\nand Gonzalo Pizarro, brothers of Francisco Pizarro, were discovered in\r\n1546.\r\n\r\nSo rich did the lodes prove to be that the city of Potosi sprang up near\r\nthem and was supported by them, although the site was far from being\r\ndesirable. Its altitude is about thirteen thousand feet, and it is,\r\ntherefore, the highest city in the world. It is situated on the bleak\r\nside of the Andes, from whose snow-clad peaks cold, piercing winds sweep\r\ndown over the city. Towering above it is a mountain, honeycombed with\r\nshafts, tunnels, and drifts, from which has been taken silver to the\r\nvalue of two billion dollars.\r\n\r\nAt first it was thought that a location so high above sea level would be\r\nunhabitable, but the immense wealth of the silver lodes required many\r\nworkmen for their development, and these laborers had to be housed and\r\nfed.\r\n\r\nAt the zenith of its prosperity Potosi possessed one hundred seventy\r\nthousand inhabitants, and had the distinction of being the largest city\r\nin the New World during the first two centuries of its existence. A mint\r\nbuilt in 1562, at the expense of over a million dollars, is long since\r\nunused. A splendid granite cathedral ornamented with beautiful statuary\r\nstill attests to the former grandeur of the city.\r\n\r\nSome of the richest veins of silver ore in the Potosi mines have been\r\nworked out and many mines have been allowed to become filled with water.\r\nThese conditions, coupled with the low price of silver for many years,\r\nhave caused the population of the city to dwindle until now there are\r\nscarcely more than ten thousand inhabitants and very many of the\r\nbuildings are in ruins. These mines have produced twenty-seven thousand\r\ntons of silver since their discovery, and at the present day many of\r\nthem are yielding large returns.\r\n\r\nThe Bolivian plateau is one vast mineral bed abounding in rich mines of\r\ncopper, tin, silver, and gold. In Bolivia alone there are upward of two\r\nthousand silver mines; while some of the richest tin mines in the world\r\nare found here. Lodes of pure tin several feet in width have been\r\nfollowed down six hundred feet. Tin mines were recently discovered among\r\nthe mountains thirteen thousand five hundred feet above the level of\r\nthe sea, near the shores of Lake Titicaca.\r\n\r\nTwo railroads now reach this high plateau, one from the seaport town of\r\nAntofagasta, Chile, to Oruro, Bolivia; the other from Molendo, Peru, to\r\nPuno, on Lake Titicaca. The most wonderful railroad in the world and the\r\nmost costly in its construction, the Oroya Railroad is about one hundred\r\nfifty miles long. It begins at Callao, Peru, and ends at Oroya. The\r\nhighest point reached by it in crossing the Andes is fifteen thousand\r\nsix hundred and sixty-five feet. It is said that seven thousand lives\r\nwere lost in its construction. Much of the road-bed was blasted through\r\nsolid rock on the sides of the mountains. The cost of construction was\r\nabout three hundred thousand dollars per mile. It has seventy-eight\r\ntunnels, the longest being the Gallera tunnel, which pierces Mount\r\nMeiggs at the altitude of fifteen thousand six hundred and sixty-five\r\nfeet. This is the highest place in the world where steam is used as a\r\nmotive power. Ultimately the road is to be extended to the celebrated\r\nmines of Cerro de Pasco, fifty-one miles beyond its present terminus,\r\nOroya.\r\n\r\nThe chief business of these railroads extending into the Andes is\r\ncarrying ore, bullion, and wool. Their construction marks the acme of\r\nengineering skill; the scenery along them surpasses that of all other\r\nregions in its wild ruggedness, grandeur, and sublimity.\r\n\r\nIn ascending to such great heights quickly one not accustomed to high\r\nelevations is apt to experience dizziness, headache, and nausea. At\r\nfirst even the effort to talk on reaching these lofty places by train is\r\nlaborious. Dogs taken from the lowlands to these elevations are unable\r\nto run with speed for a long time, but those which are born and reared\r\nin this region easily pursue wild animals.\r\n\r\nWhen the New World was discovered the llama was the only animal used\r\nthere as a beast of burden. Thousands of these diminutive creatures are\r\nstill used for transporting ore and bullion in the Andes. Each animal\r\ncan carry a load of seventy-five pounds or more. This sure-footed animal\r\ncan travel with its load about fourteen miles a day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Llamas resting]\r\n\r\nLake Titicaca is one of the famous lakes of the world. Its name means\r\ntin-stone and was doubtless derived from the tin ore found in the\r\nvicinity. The lake has an elevation of twelve thousand five hundred and\r\nfifty feet, and although nine streams run into it, only one, the\r\nDesaguadero, flows out, carrying its waters to Lake Poopo, a small body\r\nof salt water nearly three hundred miles south. Lake Titicaca has the\r\nsame surface level both summer and winter. The outflow never reaches the\r\nsea; it is lost by evaporation mainly in Lake Poopo, but the latter\r\nfrequently overflows into the salt marshes lying to the southward.\r\n\r\nThough thin ice may be found in the quiet bays and inlets nearly every\r\nmorning during the year, the expanse of the lake is never frozen even in\r\nthe severest weather. A peculiarity about the lake is that not only will\r\niron not rust when left in its waters, but that which was before rusted\r\nsoon loses its scales of rust after being immersed a few days.\r\n\r\nSeveral steamers ply on the lake carrying chiefly ore and wool. Some of\r\nthe islands in the lake are inhabited by Indians who eke out a\r\nprecarious living.\r\n\r\nA civilization antedating that of the Incas formerly occupied the region\r\nabout the lake, as is proved by the remarkable ruins along the shores\r\nconcerning which the natives told the early Spaniards that they had no\r\nrecord. Three square miles are covered by these ruins, whose walls were\r\nmade of immense blocks of stone most accurately fitted together, thus\r\ngiving evidence of the great skill in stone-cutting possessed by the\r\npre-Inca people.\r\n\r\nThe Inca rulers had beautiful palaces and other edifices on some of the\r\nislands. Titicaca Island was regarded as sacred, and at the time of the\r\nSpanish conquest was the site of a large temple richly ornamented with\r\ngold and silver.\r\n\r\nProspecting in the Andes is attended with great hardships. Few wild\r\nanimals can be found to furnish food. Food and utensils must be carried\r\non the backs of men, and the greatest difficulty is experienced in\r\ntraversing the almost inaccessible steeps and deep ravines.\r\n\r\nCoal of inferior quality has been found near the shores of Lake Titicaca\r\nand is used by the steamers sailing on its waters. Many rich mineral\r\nlodes yet remain undiscovered, and a vast number of valuable mines\r\nlanguish for lack of capital to develop them. Frequent revolutions and\r\nthe insecurity of private property prevent the investment of foreign\r\ncapital.\r\n\r\nThe Andes will continue to be a great storehouse of minerals for many\r\nyears to come.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Silver-smelting works at Cassapalca, on the Oroya\r\nRailroad, Peru, 13,600 feet high]\r\n\r\nMuffling the feet of the Peruvian Andes is a long narrow strip--drifting\r\ndunes of rock waste--known as the Atacama Desert. In comparison with\r\nthis awful desert, the Sahara is said to be a botanical garden. Here\r\nduring a part of the year a fierce, relentless sun pours down its\r\nburning rays on the shifting sands, keeping the air at a scorching heat\r\nboth day and night. Formerly the region belonged to Bolivia, but it was\r\nannexed to Chile as a result of the war of 1881.\r\n\r\nFor miles and miles not a blade of grass, not a tree, not a shrub is to\r\nbe seen. All around is a bleak, barren waste destitute of water. Yet\r\nunderneath these sands lie concealed immense deposits of \"nitrates\" of\r\nuntold wealth.\r\n\r\nAlthough small quantities of the nitrates had been sent to Europe for\r\nchemical purposes--chiefly the manufacture of gunpowder--no considerable\r\namount was exported until a fortuitous discovery was made by a Scotchman\r\nnamed George Smith. After wandering over the world for some time Smith\r\nsettled down in a little village near Iquique, where he had a small\r\ngarden containing fruit-trees and flowers. In one part of his garden he\r\nnoticed that the plants grew best where the soil contained a white\r\nsubstance.\r\n\r\nHe then proceeded to gather a quantity of the material and to experiment\r\nwith it. To his surprise he found that a mere handful of it greatly\r\nstimulated the growth of plants. He told a member of his family in\r\nScotland who was engaged in fruit-growing about the wonderful effects of\r\nthe material as a fertilizer. As a result several bags of nitrates were\r\ndistributed among Scottish farmers and fruit-growers. So satisfactory\r\ndid the fertilizer prove that an immediate call was made for more of it.\r\nThus began a business which now yields the owners of the beds one\r\nhundred million dollars yearly.\r\n\r\nIt was soon found out that the nitrate in its raw state contained\r\nproperties that were injurious to plants and that these should be first\r\neliminated. Forthwith reduction works were established to extract the\r\ndeleterious substances. These substances were mainly iodine and bromine,\r\ntwo chemical elements that are of greater value than the nitrates\r\nthemselves. Within a few years railroads were built to transport the\r\nnitrates from the beds to the various ports where the reduction\r\nfactories were erected.\r\n\r\nMany men who had large interests in the nitrate beds became immensely\r\nwealthy in a short time. The great value of the deposits caused towns\r\nand cities to spring up along the coast in the most inhospitable places,\r\nto some of which water was piped a distance of more than two hundred\r\nmiles and at the cost of many millions of dollars.\r\n\r\nThe principal nitrate beds are in a shallow valley, four or five\r\nthousand feet above sea level, lying between a long range of hills and\r\nthe base of the Andes. Just how these mineral deposits were formed it is\r\ndifficult to explain, the most plausible theory being that this desert\r\nwas once the bottom of an inland sea having vast quantities of seaweed\r\ncovered with sand. In the gradual decay of this substance the nitrate of\r\nsoda, or \"Chile saltpetre,\" was formed.\r\n\r\nTo obtain the nitrates it is necessary first to remove the top layer of\r\nsand and then a layer of clay. Underneath this is found a layer of soft,\r\nwhitish material called \"nitrate.\" The crude nitrate is sent to the\r\nnitrate ports to be crushed and boiled in sea-water. After boiling, the\r\nsolution is drawn off into shallow vessels and exposed to the heat of\r\nthe sun to evaporate.\r\n\r\nWhen nearly all has been evaporated and the remaining liquid drawn off,\r\nthe bottom and sides of the vessels are found to be covered with\r\nsparkling white crystals. This is the saltpetre of commerce, the highest\r\ngrade of which is used in the manufacture of gunpowder, the second grade\r\nfor chemical purposes, and the third grade, the great bulk, for\r\nfertilizing the exhausted soils of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe liquid drawn off is crystallized by chemical treatment and further\r\nevaporation, and from it is obtained iodine, an ounce of which is worth\r\nas much as one hundred pounds of saltpetre. From eighty to one hundred\r\nmillion dollars' worth of these nitrates are dug out and sold each year.\r\nGreat Britain takes about one-third of the entire product and Germany\r\none-fifth.\r\n\r\nIquique has the largest shipping trade. From this port about fifty\r\nmillion dollars' worth of nitrates and three million dollars' worth of\r\niodine are exported yearly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE CZAR'S GREATER DOMAIN\r\n\r\n\r\nNo other parts of the globe have been subject to so many kaleidoscopic\r\nchanges by migrations during the past eight centuries as northern Asia\r\nand eastern Europe. In comparison both India and China have remained\r\nstable for many centuries.\r\n\r\nBefore the Christian era, Mongol tribes of northeastern Asia began their\r\nwestward march, tarrying a few centuries along the way in the most\r\nfertile places and gathering force by multiplication until the\r\nthirteenth century. Then like a mighty flood they poured into eastern\r\nEurope, carrying everywhere in their pathway subjugation, devastation,\r\nand slaughter. During the early part of these migrations, the great\r\nRoman Empire trembled as she beheld the irresistible moving hosts, and\r\nher downfall was hastened by the ponderous blows dealt her by these\r\nbarbarians.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of the thirteenth century, after the Mongol ruler\r\nGenghis Khan had overrun southern Russia, he turned northward and\r\ncaptured the cities of Moscow, Vladimir, and Ryazan, putting to death\r\nmany of the inhabitants by the most fiendish methods of torture.\r\nThousands were slaughtered merely to wreak vengeance for the strong\r\nresistance offered by the besieged before surrendering. Hundreds of\r\nthousands of the Russians both high and low were made slaves. Wives of\r\nthe nobles who had been richly clad and adorned with jewels became\r\nservants of their conquerors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fishing for sturgeon through the ice of the Ural River.\r\nCatching the material for caviare]\r\n\r\nIn 1272 most of the Tartars became Muhammadans and henceforth became\r\nmore intolerant of the Christians, thousands of whom they burned alive\r\nor tortured. This oppressive yoke was borne for nearly three hundred\r\nyears. Then Ivan III succeeded in breaking the Tartar rule forever.\r\nMongol tribes, however, remained a disturbing element on the border for\r\ntwo hundred years thereafter.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of the fourteenth century Othman, a Mongol, founded\r\nthe Ottoman empire, which then consisted of only the western part of\r\nAsia Minor. His son and successor conquered Gallipoli in 1354, thereby\r\ngaining a foothold in Europe, and during the next two centuries\r\nsuccessive Turkish rulers made large additions to the empire until it\r\nembraced vast areas in Europe, Asia, and Africa. For a time, indeed, it\r\nthreatened to absorb all Christendom. Adrianople was conquered in 1361\r\nand made the capital of the Turkish Empire. Then, in 1453, after a\r\nmemorable siege, Constantinople was captured by the Muhammadans, and\r\nmade the capital of the empire.\r\n\r\nOrkhan was the first to exact as tribute the strongest and healthiest\r\nmale children of all Christian peoples whom he conquered. These youths,\r\nreared as Muhammadans and trained under strict military discipline,\r\nbecame that efficient body of troops called the Janizaries. For a long\r\ntime they were the bulwark of the empire, but at length they became so\r\ndictatorial and powerful that the sultan began to fear them more than he\r\nfeared his foreign enemies. In 1825, when the army was reorganized on\r\nthe European plan, the Janizaries broke out in open revolt. Then the\r\nreigning sultan unfurled the flag of the Prophet and called upon the\r\nfaithful to suppress the rebellious corps. In the contest that ensued it\r\nis estimated that twenty-five thousand of the rebels were put to death,\r\ntwenty thousand were banished, and the others disbanded. This was the\r\nend of an epoch of blood-shedding and the beginning of an era of\r\ncommerce.\r\n\r\nThe Russians have always been noted for their love of furs; as a result\r\na small, fur-bearing animal, the sable, led to the conquest of that vast\r\nrealm now known as Siberia.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of the sixteenth century a rich Russian merchant named\r\nStrogonoff, residing at Kazan, established salt works on the banks of\r\nthe Kama, a tributary of the Volga River, and began trading with the\r\nnatives. One day, having noticed some strangely dressed travellers and\r\nlearning that they came from a country beyond the Ural Mountains, called\r\nSibir, he despatched some of his agents into that land. On returning,\r\nthe employees brought with them the finest sable skins that the\r\nmerchant had ever seen. They had been secured for a trifling sum.\r\n\r\nStrogonoff began at once to extend the area of his trafficking, and\r\ninformed the government of the lucrative commerce that he had opened up.\r\nValuable concessions were then granted him. A few years afterward a\r\nCossack officer named Yermak, who had been declared an outlaw by Ivan\r\nthe Terrible, gathered together a force of less than one thousand men.\r\nThe band was composed of adventurers, freebooters, and criminals, and\r\nthe expedition was armed and provisioned by Strogonoff, who expected to\r\nprofit by opening up the new region. Permission having been obtained\r\nfrom the government, in 1579 Yermak set forth with his followers for the\r\nunknown country.\r\n\r\nSo great were the impediments which the pathless swamps and forest\r\noffered, together with the severity of the climate and hostility of the\r\nnatives, that his force was reduced by death, sickness, and desertion to\r\nthe number of five hundred when he lined up his men before the large\r\narmy of the powerful Kutchum Khan. Like Cortez and Pizarro, Yermak had\r\nunbounded confidence in his ability to cope with his enemies, who were\r\nrudely armed with bows and arrows, regardless of their numbers; for his\r\nown men were supplied with matchlocks, and with these--in the language\r\nof the natives--they could manufacture thunder and lightning.\r\n\r\nA terrible battle ensued, and for some time success seemed evenly\r\nbalanced. At length the fierce attacks of the Cossacks forced the\r\nbarbarous hordes to give way and the retreat became a stampede. Kutchum\r\nKhan's camp and all its treasures fell into the hands of the conquerors.\r\nYermak at once sent part of his force to occupy the Tartar capital,\r\nwhich was found to be evacuated, so great was the terror inspired by the\r\nRussians.\r\n\r\nThe success achieved by the handful of Cossacks led several neighboring\r\ntribes to offer voluntarily an annual tribute of sable skins. When\r\nYermak had collected several thousand of these skins, he sent a special\r\nenvoy to Moscow to present them along with the conquered country to the\r\nczar. So greatly pleased was Ivan with the offerings that he forgave\r\nYermak for his past ill deeds and made him governor and\r\ncommander-in-chief of all the countries which he might conquer. Then,\r\nknowing that it would be difficult for the Cossacks to hold the\r\nconquered territory very long with their diminished numbers, the czar\r\nforthwith sent reinforcements.\r\n\r\nSoon after the arrival of the additional troops, Yermak audaciously\r\nstarted out to make further conquests. One dark and rainy night he\r\nencamped with his force on a small island in the Irtish River. Relying\r\non the terror which his name had inspired, and the stormy weather, he\r\ndeemed it unnecessary to post sentinels. Wearied with their long march,\r\nsoon all of the Russians were buried in slumber.\r\n\r\nBut Kutchum, smarting under his humiliating defeat, had spies constantly\r\nwatching his foes, intending, if possible, to take them by surprise.\r\nWhen the spies reported to him the lack of vigilance on the part of the\r\nenemy, he stealthily crossed to the island with his force and fell upon\r\nthe sleeping camp. All the Russians but two were killed, and these,\r\nescaping, reported the disaster at Sibir. When Yermak saw the\r\nannihilation of his troops, he cut his way through the Tartars and\r\nattempted to swim the stream, but was dragged to the bottom by his heavy\r\narmor and drowned.\r\n\r\nWhen news of the crushing disaster reached Sibir the Russians, losing\r\nheart at the death of their leader, evacuated the place and returned\r\nhome. The czar, nevertheless, had no idea of permitting a land so\r\npromising to slip from his grasp. It was not long before he sent a\r\nlarger army across the Ural Mountains, which not only reconquered the\r\nlost territory but also the rest of western Siberia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Gathering salt at the mouth of the Ural River]\r\n\r\nGradually the Cossacks moved eastward, conquering tribe after tribe. As\r\nthey advanced they built strong wooden forts by which to hold their\r\nvantage ground. Tomsk was founded in 1604; by 1630 the tide of conquest\r\nhad reached the banks of the Lena; and within eighty years from their\r\nfirst conquest the Russians had reached the Pacific.\r\n\r\nYears afterward a suitable monument was erected to Yermak in the city of\r\nTobolsk, which was built on the battle-field where he gained his first\r\ndecisive victory over the Tartar ruler. His real monument is all\r\nSiberia, whose conquest he inaugurated.\r\n\r\nIn 1847 the Amur River section was annexed by Russia regardless of the\r\nprotests of the Chinese Government. Quarrels ensued over the boundaries\r\nand, finding resistance hopeless, the Chinese ceded to Russia all the\r\nland on the left bank of the Amur as far as the mouth of the Ussuri and\r\non both its banks below that river.\r\n\r\nThe sable gradually led the Russian hunters to Kamtchatka, while the\r\nmore valuable sea-otter beckoned them across the sea to the Aleutian\r\nIslands and that part of the American continent now Alaska Territory.\r\nThe chief incentive in all of these conquests was the securing of\r\nvaluable furs. The sable is even yet found along the streams in both\r\nopen and forested sections from the Ural Mountains to the Pacific; but\r\nso relentless has been the pursuit of this valuable fur-bearing animal\r\nthat it is now nearly exterminated. Besides the sable and the sea-otter,\r\nthere are found in Siberia the ermine, bear, arctic fox, common fox,\r\ndeer, wolf, antelope, elk, hare, and squirrel.\r\n\r\nTo avoid entering into conflict with the more powerful people at the\r\nsouth, the Russians chose to advance eastward along higher latitudes\r\ntoward the Pacific. But within a few years after the Muscovite empire\r\nhad acquired central and northern Siberia, there were loud complaints\r\nthat the tribes on the south were making raids on them, robbing them of\r\ntheir property and carrying their people into slavery. So, from time to\r\ntime, Cossack forces were sent to chastise the offenders; and in many\r\ninstances they were punished and their territories were annexed to\r\nSiberia.\r\n\r\nIn these raids the Turkomans were the most active. During the forty\r\nyears previous to 1878 it is estimated that eighty thousand Russian\r\nsubjects and two hundred thousand Persians were made captives and sold\r\ninto slavery. In 1873 the Russians captured Khiva and liberated thirty\r\nthousand Persian slaves.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding these lessons, some of the Turkoman tribes still went on\r\nmarauding expeditions, robbing, killing, and enslaving their neighbors.\r\nSo, in 1878, another strong force of the Cossacks was sent against the\r\npillaging tribes, who were made to release all slaves and abolish\r\nslavery. Little by little all Turkistan became Russian territory.\r\nBokhara and Khiva alone keep their old forms of government, but they are\r\npractically Russian states and pay Russia annually a stipulated tribute.\r\n\r\nIt is thought that once upon a time Siberia had a much larger population\r\nthan it has now and the peoples who lived there dwelt farther north. The\r\nfirst colonists lived in the stone age and were contemporaneous with the\r\nmammoth, whose remains are found scattered all over the northern part of\r\nSiberia and the adjacent islands.\r\n\r\nIn the interior these remains are found imbedded in thick strata of pure\r\nblue ice, which is covered by the river gravels of streams that do not\r\nnow exist. So thick are these layers of ice that they may be likened to\r\nthe rocks found in lower latitudes. Several of these animals have been\r\nfound imbedded in the ice in an almost perfect state of preservation,\r\nand quantities of their tusks are obtained annually along the northern\r\nrivers where the spring freshets have worn away the banks of the\r\nstreams.\r\n\r\nWhenever the ivory-tusk hunter sees the end of a tusk sticking out of\r\nthe river bank, he is soon able to remove it from its resting place with\r\npick and shovel. Great quantities of this fossil ivory are also obtained\r\nfrom the islands to the north of the mainland.\r\n\r\nAs in arctic America, the ground of northern Siberia is frozen solid to\r\nthe depth of many feet, and even during the hottest summer it thaws down\r\nonly a few inches. The climate is continental in character, being marked\r\nby fierce winds and great extremes both in temperature and moisture. In\r\nmidsummer the temperature may reach one hundred and ten degrees, while\r\nin midwinter it has been known to reach ninety degrees below zero.\r\n\r\nRoughly speaking, Siberia may be divided into three longitudinal belts:\r\nfirst, the tundra, which borders the Arctic Ocean and extends several\r\nhundred miles south of it; second, the forest belt, several hundred\r\nmiles wide, which extends across the continent; third, the southern\r\npart, consisting of desert steppes, swamps, grassy plains, and a few\r\nbroken forests.\r\n\r\nThe tundra is a vast lowland plain which in winter is a desolate, frozen\r\nwaste, and in summer a vast swamp of lichens and arctic moss. Here\r\nnature is embalmed in eternal frost, and life is a terror-inspiring\r\nstruggle with cold and hunger.\r\n\r\nIn spring, when the snow is gone and the ground begins to thaw,\r\nthousands of geese, ducks, swans, and other feathered creatures appear,\r\nenlivening the monotonous scene for a few months; then, when the sharp\r\nSeptember frosts announce the approach of winter, with their\r\ntundra-reared progeny they wing their way southward, leaving the icy\r\nplains to the wandering fox and the arctic owl.\r\n\r\nOne writer speaks of the tundra as the very grave of nature, the\r\nsepulchre of the primeval world, because it is the tomb of so many\r\nanimals whose remains have been protected from putrefaction for\r\nthousands of years. How interesting would it be could these animals be\r\nbrought to life and be endowed with sufficient intelligence to relate\r\nthe history of their age and generation!\r\n\r\nThe reindeer in the valley of the Lena spend the winter near the\r\nforests, but as the spring advances they migrate to the thousands of\r\nislands in the delta to escape the heat and mosquitoes farther south. To\r\nreach their destination they are obliged to swim across broad channels\r\nof water. The animals have special places for crossing, and on their\r\nreturn south the natives station themselves at these places and\r\nslaughter them in large numbers.\r\n\r\nAll the swamps and marshes throughout Siberia are the breeding places\r\nof innumerable mosquitoes, which in summer fly over the country in such\r\ndense clouds as to render life in certain sections almost unbearable.\r\n\r\nJust north of Mongolia where the Yenisei River enters Russian territory\r\nis the wonderfully interesting fertile prairie region of Minusinsk.\r\nBeing well watered and sheltered on all sides by mountains, it is one of\r\nthe most fertile spots in all Siberia. Here the disintegration of\r\ngold-bearing rocks has formed large mining fields which are profitably\r\nworked. In the vicinity are also valuable iron mines, which were opened\r\nearly in the prehistoric period, and which are still worked.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Driving over the tundra in winter]\r\n\r\nBecause of its delightful climate and special attractions for the\r\narchæologist, this charming section is called the \"Italy of Siberia.\"\r\nThere have been obtained from the mounds found in this section many\r\nthousand relics relating to prehistoric man which exemplify his progress\r\nfrom the stone age through the bronze to the iron age. This fine\r\ncollection of upward of sixty thousand different articles is housed in\r\nan imposing and substantial museum erected in the town of Minusinsk.\r\nThis building contains the richest collection of implements representing\r\nthe bronze age in the world.\r\n\r\nThe forest belt is so immense that the wooded plains of the Amazon\r\nshrink into comparative insignificance. For the most part these great\r\nforests are composed of evergreen trees, the fir, pine, larch, and\r\npitch-pine predominating. In many localities there are hundreds of\r\nsquare miles of perfectly straight pine trees of great height, where\r\nneither man nor beast could find the way out. Even experienced trappers\r\ndare not enter these forests without blazing trees along their pathway,\r\nso that they may be able to extricate themselves by retracing their\r\nsteps. In these huge evergreen solitudes there is an inexhaustible\r\nsupply of the finest timber in the world. In every sense of the word\r\nthey are solitudes; for one may travel scores of miles without meeting\r\nor hearing either bird or beast.\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of the war between Japan and Russia it was stipulated\r\nthat Russia should cede to Japan the southern part of Sakhalin Island.\r\nThe cession was made in 1905. During the following two years a large\r\nnumber of Russians and Japanese were employed in marking the boundary,\r\nby cutting through the forest from east to west a strip one hundred\r\nmiles long and twelve miles wide. The fir forests of the Japanese\r\nportion, covering more than three million acres, are alone estimated to\r\nbe worth forty-five million dollars, to say nothing about the extensive\r\ncoal deposits and the large areas of land available for tillage.\r\n\r\nOf the native peoples of northern Siberia the Yakuts are the most\r\nnumerous. They resemble both the Eskimos and the Lapps. They occupy\r\nseveral valleys, including that of the Lena River and a strip along the\r\nArctic Ocean to the west. So inured to cold are these people, that where\r\nthe temperature ranges from ninety degrees below zero to ninety-three\r\ndegrees above, the adults wear light clothing in the depth of winter and\r\nthe children sport naked in the snow.\r\n\r\nThe desert zone includes a vast region east of the Caspian Sea and\r\nextends to the Tian Shan Mountains, which separate it from the desert of\r\nGobi. Here, as in the Mohave Desert, are found the leafless, thickly\r\nspined forms of the cactus family.\r\n\r\nA product peculiar to Siberia and highly appreciated by the inhabitants\r\non account of its edible qualities is the cedar nut found in all of the\r\nnorthern forest region. So great is the demand for these nuts that in\r\nTomsk alone thousands of tons are sold each year. They resemble pine\r\nnuts. A gum called larch-tree sulphur, chewed by both natives and\r\nsettlers, is also obtained from these forests. Bee-keeping, especially\r\nin eastern Siberia, is an important industry which has been followed\r\nfrom remotest ages. The annual yield of honey is estimated to be upward\r\nof three million pounds.\r\n\r\nThe camel is usually associated with the hot desert regions of the\r\nSahara and Arabia, yet in Siberia immense numbers of camels are used. It\r\nis not an uncommon sight to see them in midwinter hauling sledges along\r\nfrozen roads and ice-covered rivers.\r\n\r\nThe richest gold fields are in the swamp and forest sections of central\r\nSiberia and in the Ural and Altai Mountains, although the metal is\r\nwidely scattered all the way from the Ural Mountains to the Pacific. The\r\nword Altai means gold. The world's supply of platinum virtually comes\r\nfrom the gold-mines of Siberia as a by-product. In many parts of the\r\nmining region, as in Alaska, the frozen ground must be thawed by fires\r\nbefore it can be worked.\r\n\r\nThe building of the Trans-Siberian Railroad has wrought a wonderful\r\ntransformation in Siberia by giving a great impetus to agriculture and\r\nother kinds of business. This great achievement, begun in 1891, was\r\npractically completed in eleven years, at a cost of one hundred and\r\nseventy-five million dollars. Subsequent work, together with equipment,\r\ndouble tracking, and the building of additional lines, has doubled the\r\nfirst cost.\r\n\r\nThe eastern terminus of the main line is Vladivostock; a branch line\r\nacross Manchuria reaches Port Arthur and Dalny, or Tairen, as it is now\r\ncalled. The continuous railway route from St. Petersburg to Port Arthur\r\nis five thousand six hundred and twenty miles, four thousand five\r\nhundred miles of which is in Siberia. The first rails used, proving too\r\nlight for the tremendous traffic, were replaced with heavier ones, and\r\nthe road-bed itself has been widened and strengthened.\r\n\r\nThe fare on the road is very reasonable. For long distances it ranges\r\nfrom about a cent per mile to less than half that rate, accordingly as\r\none travels first, second, third, or fourth class. Riding first class\r\none can secure sleeping accommodations equal to the best that one finds\r\non the roads of the United States, and in addition one may have the\r\nluxury of a bath.\r\n\r\nSince the completion of the road the government has done everything\r\npossible to attract Russian emigration from Europe in order to settle\r\nand develop the country. The consumer in Russia becomes a producer in\r\nSiberia. The number of Russian emigrants who have settled along the line\r\nduring the past five years will average one hundred and fifty thousand\r\nannually.\r\n\r\nTo start the Russian farmers in these new regions the government gives\r\neach man of family a certain amount of money or an equivalent in stock\r\nand tools; and in addition loans him small amounts at a low rate of\r\ninterest, to be repaid in five years, with a proviso that if there be\r\nbad crops the time will be extended. For the year 1908, nine million\r\nfive hundred thousand dollars was set aside to assist the peasant\r\nfarmers.\r\n\r\nFollowing in the wake of the completion of the Trans-Siberian Railroad,\r\nadditional steamers have been placed on all the large rivers to meet the\r\ngrowing demands of commerce. Hundreds of steamers ply upon the rivers\r\nduring the open season, but no vessels attempt the route by way of the\r\nArctic Ocean on account of the long distance and frequent ice\r\nobstructions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Train on the steppes of Russia]\r\n\r\nDairying, now a most important industry of Siberia, was unknown before\r\nthe advent of the great railway. To promote this industry, the\r\ngovernment has already expended more than a million dollars. At all the\r\nprincipal places schools have been established in which the best methods\r\nof dairy-farming are taught. Fortunately, cattle diseases are\r\npractically unknown.\r\n\r\nThe fine quality of the grasses, together with the improved methods of\r\nmanufacturing brought about by the creameries, causes Siberian butter\r\nto rank with the best products found in the European markets. The dairy\r\nproducts are shipped by rail to various parts of Europe, large\r\nquantities going to England and to Denmark, the home of dairying.\r\nSometimes three hundred tons of butter per week are shipped to\r\nCopenhagen and one thousand tons to London. Upward of eighty million\r\npounds are annually exported, and it is said that by a little exertion\r\nfifteen times the amount could be easily produced. The industry is still\r\nonly in its infancy.\r\n\r\nIn the Tobol and Ishim plains of western Siberia are the fertile\r\nblack-earth regions covering twenty-five million acres. As yet, they are\r\nsparsely settled, but they are capable of supporting half the population\r\nof Russia. Two-thirds of the inhabitants of Siberia are Russians, and in\r\ntimbered regions probably one-half live in log houses, for these are\r\ncapable of being made the most comfortable dwellings in the world.\r\n\r\nMany exaggerated statements have appeared, both in England and America,\r\nconcerning the exile system. This, happily, is now abolished, as also\r\nhave been the cruelties practised by those in charge. That there have\r\nbeen great abuses no one denies, but the conditions of the prisons can\r\nbe paralleled both in England and the United States. No more common\r\ncriminals are sent to Siberia.\r\n\r\nTransportation is now limited chiefly to escaped convicts and to\r\npolitical and religious criminals, most of whom are sent to the island\r\nof Sakhalin. Capital punishment, except in cases of attacks on the royal\r\nfamily and condemnation by courts-martial, was abolished many years ago.\r\n\r\nLake Baikal is one of the most remarkable lakes in the world. It is four\r\nhundred miles long and from twenty to sixty miles wide. The lake is very\r\ndeep, and, although situated in the temperate zone, is the home of a\r\nspecies of arctic seal and tropical coral. This species of seal is\r\nfound nowhere in Asian waters outside of the Arctic Ocean, except in\r\nthis lake and the Caspian Sea. Immense quantities of salmon of different\r\nspecies abound in the lake, and give rise to important fishing\r\nindustries.\r\n\r\nIn winter the lake is covered with ice seven feet thick. Crossing is\r\nmade by huge ice-breaking ferryboats capable of carrying thirty cars and\r\none thousand men, yet only during a part of the winter is the boat able\r\nto navigate, so persistent is the extreme cold. The railway now extends\r\naround the southern part of the lake, and crossing by ferryboats is not\r\nattempted when the ice is thick.\r\n\r\nAsiatic Russia includes Transcaucasia, which was permanently annexed to\r\nthe Russian Empire in 1801. This great Asiatic domain contains more than\r\nsix million square miles, or about twice the size of the United States,\r\nincluding Alaska.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the millions of square miles of arid deserts,\r\nirredeemable swamps, frozen tundra, and impenetrable forests, the\r\nagricultural and mineral resources of Siberia are almost beyond\r\ncomputation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE MYSTIC HIGHLANDS OF ASIA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe statement that \"one half the world does not know how the other half\r\nlives, nor how it is influenced,\" applies with double force to the\r\npeoples living on the high plateau of Tibet beyond the titanic\r\nHimalayas. Here is a vast region only one-twentieth of which is covered\r\nwith vegetation. Chains of mountains with snow-capped peaks encircle it,\r\nand spurs from the main ranges, together with lesser ridges and isolated\r\nelevations, diversify its surface.\r\n\r\nAmidst these desolate wastes are fertile valleys which are capable of\r\nproducing excellent crops; in many other sections good crops are\r\nproduced by very primitive methods of irrigation. As a whole the plateau\r\nmay be classed among the infertile regions of the earth.\r\n\r\nOn account of its great elevation, Tibet is often called the roof of the\r\nworld. Starting from its borders several large rivers break through its\r\nrocky ramparts, among them the Indus, Brahmaputra, Irawadi, and Hoang.\r\nSome of the plains of the great plateau range from fifteen to eighteen\r\nthousand feet above sea level. Scattered over these are single lakes and\r\nchains of lakes, many of which are salt. These vast areas, storm-swept\r\nin winter and baked by heat in summer, are frequented by bandits and\r\nnomads. They live in tents made of the almost black hair of the yak, and\r\nmove from place to place with their flocks and herds to seek food for\r\ntheir animals. The stable population resides chiefly in the few cities\r\nand villages.\r\n\r\nFor nearly a thousand years a veil of religious mystery has shrouded\r\nthis section of the world; and the sacred city of Lasa with its holy\r\nplaces has been doubly guarded against the visits of foreigners.\r\n\r\nThis mysterious land has been able to maintain its position of isolated\r\nseclusion because of the high mountain barriers that are massed in a\r\nseries of gigantic walls on all sides. It is approachable only through\r\nnarrow passes that are constantly guarded.\r\n\r\nOur knowledge of the \"forbidden land,\" as it is called, has been\r\nobtained chiefly from adventurers who have travelled through it in\r\ndisguise, and from a few others who took more desperate chances by\r\nforcing their way in. Among these may be mentioned Bower, Thorald, the\r\nLittledales, Rockhill, Captain Deasy, Sven Hedin, and Walter Savage\r\nLandor. Landor was taken prisoner by the Tibetans and suffered at their\r\nhands horrible tortures, from the effects of which he will never\r\nrecover.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Dunkar Spiti, Himalaya Mountains, India]\r\n\r\nBecause the Tibetans for many years had insulted the government of India\r\nand had seized territory claimed by it, English troops under Colonel\r\nYounghusband were sent against the invaders in 1903, and after several\r\nsevere battles reached the forbidden city of Lasa, where a forced treaty\r\nwas negotiated and signed. But on the withdrawal of the English troops\r\nthe policy of exclusion was immediately resumed. Russia to-day has much\r\ngreater influence in Tibet than has England.\r\n\r\nThe present condition of Tibet resembles in many respects that of Europe\r\nduring the Middle Ages. The country is under the suzerainty of China,\r\nwhich has a representative called an amaban and several thousand troops\r\nat Lasa to maintain its claim.\r\n\r\nThough an extremely trying climate prevails on these highlands, the\r\nhermit-like, priest-ridden people know no better home and are contented\r\nwith their lot. Of its three and one-half million inhabitants, one in\r\nseven belongs to the priestly class called lamas.\r\n\r\nAt the head of this priesthood, as well as at the head of the state, are\r\ntwo leaders, the chief one, the Dalai Lama, or \"ocean of learning,\" and\r\nthe other the Bogodo Lama, or \"precious teacher.\" With their\r\nsubordinates, these two are supposed to have power not only over life\r\nand death, but over the reincarnation of the soul and entrance to the\r\nregions beyond rebirth.\r\n\r\nThis isolated table-land is the seat of a former Buddhism better known\r\nby the name of Lamaism. A deep but crude religious feeling tainted with\r\nthe grossest superstitions pervades the whole people, whose ignorance of\r\nother learning is appalling.\r\n\r\nWhen a person dies a lama must be present to see that the soul is\r\nproperly separated from the body and to direct the spirit on its journey\r\nto paradise; the lama must also influence its rebirth in a happy\r\nexistence and provide for its entrance upon Nirvana, or eternal rest.\r\n\r\nMany a mountain contains hollowed-out cells in which hermit monks spend\r\ntheir lives in silent meditation. On an island in one of the lakes,\r\nwhere they can be reached only when the lake freezes, reside twenty\r\nmonks. In the midst of this wild and majestic scenery each rock and\r\nstream has its deity and saint, together with its appropriate legend.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Buddhist monks do not believe in God as a creator, their\r\nreligion demands audible and written prayers; indeed, prayer-wheels are\r\nfrequently used to facilitate the repetition of prayers. Prayers\r\nnumbering hundreds and even thousands are carefully written and placed,\r\nrolled up, in drum-wheels, which are revolved by wind, water, or hand\r\npower. Each revolution of a wheel is supposed to say all the prayers\r\nenclosed in it.\r\n\r\nMany prayer-wheels, each with appropriate prayers, are mounted on axles\r\nand placed convenient to frequented paths so that they may be whirled\r\naround by those who pass by. Others provided with suitable fans are\r\nplaced where they may be revolved by the wind. Sometimes water power is\r\nmade to turn the wheels, but most of them are made of a size convenient\r\nto be carried about and operated by hand.\r\n\r\nThe capital of Tibet and seat of the Dalai Lama is Lasa, situated in a\r\nplain nearly twelve thousand feet above sea level. The city is\r\nsurrounded by a marsh and is reached by a causeway raised above the\r\nmorass. It has wide and regular streets, the principal buildings being\r\nmade of stone, but the majority of the structures are adobe and\r\nsun-dried brick.\r\n\r\nThis interesting city contains forty-five thousand inhabitants,\r\ntwo-thirds of whom are monks. Streams formed by the melting snow course\r\ndown the surrounding mountains, flooding the plain. At a distance the\r\ncity presents an imposing appearance with the adjacent Potala as the\r\ncrowning glory.\r\n\r\nIn the centre of the city stands a cathedral, called the Jo-Kang, which\r\ncontains one of the most renowned statues of Buddha. This image, of life\r\nsize, is an object of the greatest reverence and adoration. It is made\r\nof a composition of metals, gold and silver predominating. Priests are\r\nalways in attendance and lamps are constantly burning before it. The\r\nroof of the temple is gilded and the interior is richly furnished.\r\n\r\nSituated in the suburbs, on a rocky elevation above the plain which\r\noverlooks the city, is a wonderful group of buildings forming the\r\nPotala, or palace of the Dalai Lama. This huge, conglomerate structure\r\nof granite rising story above story to an immense height fascinates the\r\nbeholder, who marvels at the skill and patience of the builders.\r\n\r\nAs though to heighten its beauty, the Potala is separated from the city\r\nby a park of grass and trees about a mile wide, making the stately\r\nedifice look like a huge diamond encircled with emeralds. Nothing but a\r\nblind religious zeal could have brought to completion such a series of\r\nconnected edifices with their miles of halls, courts, corridors, and\r\nlabyrinthine passageways.\r\n\r\nScattered throughout Tibet are upward of three thousand monasteries, or\r\nlamaseries. Some of them are built in remote and inaccessible places and\r\ncontain as many as seven thousand monks. Each lamasery has set apart for\r\nits use the best land in that vicinity, the cultivation of which is done\r\nby the common people, who are little better than serfs, or peons.\r\n\r\nIt is a notable fact that in this strange land there are many more men\r\nthan women, although the reverse would be expected. The support of the\r\nhordes of lazy monks is a great incubus and retards the development of\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The yak not only serves as a beast of burden, but\r\nfurnishes milk, butter, and meat]\r\n\r\nThe use of water for cleansing purposes seems to be no part of the\r\nreligion of the people; they never bathe their bodies and seldom wash\r\nthe face and hands. To protect themselves from the biting cold they\r\nsmear their faces with rancid butter, which, catching the smoke and\r\ndust, adds to the effectiveness as well as the strength of the odor.\r\nTheir homes and places of worship reek with dirt and filth; small-pox,\r\nailments of the eyes, and other contagious diseases are prevalent.\r\nHarelip, in a great measure due to lack of proper nutrition, is a very\r\ncommon ailment.\r\n\r\nIn leather and inlaid work the Tibetans show great skill, much of the\r\ndecorative work on the handles of their swords and daggers being very\r\nartistic. The common people live in constant terror of evil spirits in\r\nthis world and of terrible punishments in the hereafter; the educated\r\nclasses believe they can drive off or propitiate all evil influences in\r\nthis world, but fear they may be changed in a future rebirth to some\r\nvile form of being. In general, the people are treacherous and cowardly.\r\nFor weapons of defence they use matchlocks; in firing them, the weapon\r\nis held directly in front of the nose.\r\n\r\nOf domestic animals the yak is one of the most useful, since it not only\r\nserves as a beast of burden but furnishes rich milk, butter, and meat.\r\nThe long hair of the animal is used for making ropes, tents, and cloth.\r\n\r\nThe yak resembles the ox in body, head, and legs; but it is covered with\r\nlong, silky hair which hangs like the fleece of an Angora goat. The\r\nlong, flowing hair of the tail reaches nearly to the ground. Thousands\r\nof these tails find their way to India where they are used for various\r\nhousehold purposes.\r\n\r\nWild yaks are found in considerable numbers near the limits of perpetual\r\nsnow, but at the approach of winter they descend to the wooded valleys\r\njust below the snow line. During the summer they pasture on the higher\r\nelevations. In their wild state yaks are fierce and dangerous. Being\r\naccustomed to high elevations, they fall sick and die when removed to\r\nthe lowlands.\r\n\r\nMilk is obtained not only from the yaks but from the sheep and goats.\r\nThe sheep, being of large size, are frequently used to bear small loads.\r\nMany horses are raised, but they are used chiefly for riding.\r\n\r\nTibet is rich in gold, and for thousands of years the precious metal has\r\nbeen washed out of its surface by the crudest of methods. In fact, gold\r\nis washed from every river which has its sources in the Tibetan plateau.\r\nMost of it in time finds its way to China. Silver, copper, iron, lead,\r\nand mercury abound in the southeastern part and considerable quantities\r\nare mined.\r\n\r\nTraffic is carried on by means of caravans, the most common pack animal\r\nbeing the yak. Almost all the commerce is controlled by Chinese\r\nmerchants, and the chief article of trade is tea, which is received in\r\nexchange for wool, hides, musk, amber, and gold. The tea is an inferior\r\nkind known as \"brick tea,\" being composed of the refuse, stems, and\r\nleaves of the plants cemented with rice water and pressed into hard\r\nbricks. This kind of tea is preferred by the Tibetans, who brew it with\r\nbutter and other ingredients and consume the entire concoction. The tea\r\ntrade amounts to several million pounds annually.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE PRIMAL HOME OF THE SARACEN\r\n\r\n\r\nWho has not had the youthful imagination fired by the \"Arabian Nights\"?\r\nThe simplicity and lifelike reality of these interesting stories, made\r\neven more fascinating by their Oriental color, appeal both to young and\r\nold.\r\n\r\nSo great has been their popularity that few works have been translated\r\ninto so many different languages, while their influence on the\r\nliterature of the present day is felt in a marked degree. They are more\r\nthan the luxurious fancies of the Arab's mind, for they vividly set\r\nforth the love and hate, the craft and hypocrisy, the courage and\r\nrevenge of his race. Moreover, they portray in a truly dramatic manner\r\nthe innermost life and thought of the Moslem, while they captivate the\r\nsenses by a magnificent panorama of exquisite banquets, lovely\r\ncharacters, charming gardens, and beautiful palaces.\r\n\r\nThe country and the descendants of the race that created these masterly\r\nstoriettes are surely worthy of careful consideration. A region that is\r\nthe birthplace of a religion claiming nearly two hundred million\r\nconverts scattered all over the world must possess a special interest.\r\n\r\nWe are apt to look askance at everything Arabic as bordering on\r\nignorance and savagery; but if we study the past of this alert race we\r\nshall find a profusion of historical side lights that are valuable; we\r\nshall also find in Arabic literature much to admire. The Arab is poetic\r\nand delights in imagery. There are Arabic poems dating back one thousand\r\nyears before the Christian era that for beauty of thought, vigor, and\r\npolish are equal to those produced by any nation and in any age.\r\n\r\nIn the Middle Ages the Arabs led the world in commerce, exploration,\r\nart, science, and literature. The secret of their successful conquests\r\nwas not in the number of their soldiers but in the courage inspired by\r\nthe Muhammadan religion. Death has no terrors for the fanatical Moslem,\r\nfor to him it is the vestibule of paradise where the pleasures of earth\r\nawait those who fight in the holy cause.\r\n\r\nBy nature the Arab is active, vivacious, and keen-witted. He is proud of\r\nhis lineage, earnest, and hospitable. The mother not only takes care of\r\nthe home but educates the children; and, strange as it may seem to the\r\noutside world, illiteracy is practically unknown to Arabia.\r\n\r\nTo the Arabic race we are indebted for our knowledge of arithmetic, and\r\nmany of the principles of algebra and geometry. The pendulum, the\r\nmariner's compass, and the manufacture of silk and cotton textiles were\r\nintroduced into Europe by the Arabs. They claim to have used gunpowder\r\nas far back as the eleventh century. In the year 706 paper was made at\r\nMecca and from there its manufacture spread all over the western world.\r\nTo them we owe many of the useful arts and practical inventions which\r\nwere later brought to perfection by other nations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Khaibar Pass, the gateway to India]\r\n\r\nNow, no one is quite certain about the Saracens as a people because the\r\nname has been very loosely used. It was applied by Roman soldiers to\r\nseveral wandering tribes of Arabs who were much accustomed to mistaking\r\nother people's flocks of sheep and herds of cattle for their own. Most\r\nlikely there never was a Saracenic Empire. But there certainly was a\r\ntime when Arabians controlled not only the Arabian peninsula, but also\r\nSyria and the fertile plains of the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers as well;\r\nand that great region became known as the \"Land of the Saracens.\" From\r\nDamascus to Bagdad, and from the Bab-el-Mandeb to the Gulf of Oman, the\r\nMoslem was all-powerful.\r\n\r\nLet us glance at the country itself. In the first place, Arabia is not a\r\nnation but a country made up of petty states--some independent, some\r\ncontrolled by the sultan of Turkey; two or three are included in the\r\nBritish Empire. But the country itself is very far removed from the rest\r\nof the world so far as accessibility is concerned; and although its\r\ncoast is scarcely a gunshot from the greatest trade route of the East,\r\nArabia is to-day one of the least-known countries in the world.\r\n\r\nIn general, the country is a moderately high table-land bordered by low\r\ncoast plains. Much of it is an out-and-out desert; all of it is arid.\r\nLong ago it was divided into Arabia Petræa, Arabia Deserta, and Arabia\r\nFelix--that is, the rocky, the desert, and the happy. It is needless to\r\nsay that Arabia the happy was the part receiving enough rainfall to\r\nproduce foodstuffs.\r\n\r\nThe coast-line of this great peninsula is nearly as great as that of the\r\nAtlantic and Gulf coast of the United States; but in its entire extent,\r\nnot far from four thousand miles, there is scarcely a harbor in which a\r\ngood-sized fishing schooner could find safe anchorage. Even at Aden a\r\nsteamship cannot approach within a quarter of a mile of the shore. So\r\none will not be far out of the way in designating Arabia as an\r\nimpassable country with an impossible coast.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that about seven millions of people live in the entire\r\npeninsula. To say that these belong to the Semitic race is merely to say\r\nthat they are dark-skinned and black-haired. The Arab, whether a\r\nmerchant dwelling in a city along the coast, or a Bedouin wandering with\r\nflocks and herds, is a product of the desert and of the teachings of\r\nIslam. His black eyes twinkle with shrewdness and he is a past master of\r\ncraftiness. As a trader he is unsurpassed, and Arab traders control the\r\ninterior commerce of western Asia and northern Africa just as the\r\nChinese control the trade of southeastern Asia.\r\n\r\nAs a Bedouin of the desert the Arab is supreme in his way. Savage and\r\nblood-thirsty by nature, if there is no caravan to rob or common enemy\r\nto fight, neighboring tribes easily find cause for fighting one another.\r\nUsually a quarrel over pasture lands in the same locality furnishes an\r\nexcuse for a feud that results in the extermination of one tribe or the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nA hatred of those who are not followers of the prophet is a heritage of\r\nall Arabs. The merchant class, who are wealthy and usually educated, may\r\nhave trained themselves to conceal it, but they possess it. Even to the\r\nmost liberal Arab, one who is not of the faith of Islam is a \"dog of an\r\nunbeliever.\" Among Bedouins, not to rob the caravan containing the\r\nbelongings of a Christian would be a sin. There is one exception,\r\nhowever; if a Bedouin sheik agrees to convoy a party of \"unbelievers,\"\r\ntogether with their valuables, over a robber-infested route, he will\r\ncarry out his bargain faithfully.\r\n\r\nFamily ties among the Bedouin Arabs are much the same to-day as they\r\nwere two thousand years ago. The great-grandfather, grandfather, or\r\nfather, as the case may be, is the head of the family, and his will is\r\nlaw. The tribe is governed by a sheik, who is simply a \"boss.\" He does\r\nnot inherit his office, nor is he elected to it by popular vote; he\r\nelects himself because he is the best man, and he \"holds over\" for the\r\nsame reason.\r\n\r\nThe family mansion of the Bedouin is a tent made of goat-hair cloth.\r\nSome tents occupy as much ground as is covered by a small cottage. The\r\ntent of a sheik may be richly furnished with rugs and silk portières;\r\nordinarily, a coarse hearth-rug and a divan cover are about the only\r\nfurnishings. The cooking utensils are primitive--one or two kettles to a\r\nfamily; and of tableware there is practically nothing more than one or\r\ntwo platters. Meat is freely eaten and coffee is commonly a part of each\r\nmeal. In the place of bread, flour about as coarse as oatmeal is mixed\r\nto a paste, rolled or beaten into thin cakes, and cooked in hot butter.\r\nDates are almost always a part of the food supply.\r\n\r\nThe camel has first place in the wealth of the Bedouin, but sheep and\r\ngoats in many instances form a part of his herds. The tents of a family\r\nare pitched where the grazing is good and the families move about as\r\nthey will. All disputes are settled by the sheik, and he is apt to\r\nemphasize his decisions by the free use of his lance shaft. Whenever it\r\nbecomes necessary because of poor grazing, the whole clan or tribe may\r\nmove to a distant place. All household goods are wrapped in packs or put\r\ninto saddle bags. Two or three camels will readily carry the tent and\r\nluggage of a family. The women are carried in litters; the men ride\r\ncamels. Horses are rarely ridden at such times.\r\n\r\nIf a caravan is to be plundered, however, the best horses are used, and\r\nin addition to his lance the raider carries a heavy knife. Perhaps a few\r\nfirearms may be carried, but they are generally either flintlocks or the\r\nolder matchlocks. It is only within a few years that the modern rifle\r\nwith metal cartridge has found favor with the Bedouin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A group of Arabs with their dromedaries]\r\n\r\nThe great Arabian peninsula, seemingly so far out of the world, produces\r\nmany things, some of which the world cannot do well without. First of\r\nall, it is the home of the camel. Perhaps a more awkward and ungainly\r\nanimal has not been domesticated, but certainly none is more useful. We\r\nare told by students of natural history that the camel is the descendant\r\nof the llama kind which seems to have originated in the South American\r\nAndes. Just how or when the descent from the New World, which is really\r\nthe Old World, to the Old World, which is really the New World, was made\r\nwe are not informed; nevertheless, it looks as though the natural\r\nhistory student has the right end of the argument. After the animal got\r\nto Arabia it \"developed.\" And while the result may not have been very\r\nartistic, no one will deny that it was good workmanship; for the world\r\nhas never produced a more useful helper to mankind.\r\n\r\nPractically all the riding animals are of the one-hump or Arabian\r\nspecies. They are much larger and stronger than the two-hump animals.\r\nOne variety is slim and comparatively light in weight. These animals, as\r\na rule, are trained to a swift gait, and are used solely as riding\r\nanimals. They are called dromedaries, a word that means swift-runner.\r\n\r\nMost of the other species are reared for the same purpose as domestic\r\ncattle. Some are valuable as beasts of burden, others are shorn for\r\ntheir coating, still others are kept for their milk and flesh. A\r\nwell-trained dromedary will sell for three hundred dollars and upward; a\r\npack animal rarely brings more than one-fourth as much. The milk of the\r\ncamel is equal to that of the best domestic cows and is greatly prized.\r\nThe hair of several species surpasses sheep's wool in texture and is\r\nused in the finer kinds of cloth, and it is the most precious textile in\r\nhigh-priced Oriental rugs and shawls. Ordinarily, however, camel's hair\r\nis coarse and is used for the cheapest textiles. Arabia is the source\r\nfrom which a large proportion of the camels used in the caravan trade of\r\nAsia and Africa is obtained. Fermented camel's milk is much used all\r\nover western Asia.\r\n\r\nThe Arabian horse has been famous in literature and in song for more\r\nthan two thousand years. The district of Nejd has been the chief\r\nbreeding locality for these horses for many centuries. Contrary to\r\ntradition, however, even the finest animals are neither so large nor so\r\nswift as American thoroughbred horses. The qualities that have made the\r\nArabian horse famous are its beautiful proportions, endurance, and\r\nintelligence. Young colts mingle freely with their owners and\r\nattendants, and they need, therefore, only the training to make them\r\nsaddle-wise; they require no \"breaking.\" Brought up with the family and\r\ntreated with the greatest kindness from its birth the colt learns to\r\nregard his master as his best friend.\r\n\r\nOrdinarily but little water is given them, and they are so well trained\r\nthat a good animal will go a whole day in summer and two days in winter\r\nwithout drink. The pure, full-blood Arabian is never sold. It may be\r\nacquired only by gift, by capture in war, or by legacy. Animals of mixed\r\nbreed, however, are freely sold, most of them going to Turkey and to\r\nIndia.\r\n\r\nMocha coffee is another product for which Arabia is renowned. The coffee\r\nberry bearing this name is of the peaberry variety--that is, only one of\r\nthe two seeds within the husk comes to maturity. Most of the coffee is\r\ngrown in Yemen and the adjoining vilayets, and it received its name\r\nbecause it was formerly marketed at the port of Mocha. Of late years it\r\nhas been shipped from Hodeida.\r\n\r\nThe business is in the hands of Arab merchants, and the coffee is\r\ncarried to Hodeida by caravans. On its way it is carefully sorted by\r\nhand into three or more grades. The finest grade is sold to wealthy\r\nTurkish customers at from three to five dollars per pound; the inferior\r\ngrades command prices varying from thirty cents to twice or three times\r\nas much. Very little of the product ever passes outside of Turkey. All\r\nthe Mocha coffee grown in Yemen would not much more than supply New York\r\nCity.\r\n\r\nThe pearl fisheries along the Arabian coast of the Persian Gulf are also\r\ncontrolled by Arab traders. From there are obtained some of the finest\r\npearls to be found, and also many tons of mother-of-pearl shells. The\r\nyearly product of the fisheries is thought to exceed more than two\r\nmillions of dollars in value. The pearls are found in a species of\r\noyster, and to obtain them the divers must go to the bottom in from\r\nthirty to ninety feet of water. Expert divers can remain under water as\r\nlong as two minutes.\r\n\r\nThe oysters are taken ashore to be opened, and Turkish inspectors are on\r\nhand to levy a tax on the product. A few pearls may escape him,\r\nespecially if he is temporarily blinded by the glare of several\r\npiasters; but the pearl industry is taxed for about all that it is\r\nworth.\r\n\r\nMecca, the birthplace of the Prophet Muhammad, is the city to which\r\nevery disciple of Islam is supposed to make a pilgrimage at least once\r\nin his lifetime. The chief income of the inhabitants of Mecca is\r\nobtained by renting rooms and entertaining the visiting pilgrims who\r\nflock thither.\r\n\r\nIn the centre of the city is the so-called Sacred Mosque, or area, which\r\nis entirely enclosed by a covered structure of colonnades having\r\nminarets and cupolas. Within the centre of this enclosed space is a\r\ncube-shaped building called the Kaaba, which contains the famous sacred\r\nBlack Stone. This stone, probably of meteoric origin, gives to the\r\nbuilding its sanctity, and is an object of the greatest veneration to\r\nevery pious Moslem, who kisses it repeatedly. There is also within the\r\nenclosure a building containing the holy well, Zemzem, the only well in\r\nMecca.\r\n\r\nNo unbeliever is permitted to enter the sacred enclosure, much less to\r\npollute the Holy Kaaba by his presence. A few infidels disguised as\r\npilgrims, at the risk of their lives, have visited this sacred place.\r\n\r\nThe preparations for pilgrimage are unique. The pilgrims assemble near\r\nMecca during the holy month and begin the sacred rites by bathing and\r\nassuming the sacred garb. This suit consists of two woollen wrappers,\r\none worn around the middle of the body and the other around the\r\nshoulders. With bare head and slippers covering neither heel nor instep\r\nthe pilgrim sets forth on his holy journey.\r\n\r\nWhile wearing this dress he is admonished to bring his thoughts into\r\nharmony with the sanctity of the territory he now traverses. He is not\r\nto shave, anoint his head, pare his nails, or bathe until the end of the\r\npilgrimage. Among the various rites to be performed after reaching Mecca\r\nis walking seven times around the Kaaba, first slowly, then quickly.\r\nBefore leaving the city the pilgrim drinks water from the holy well,\r\nZemzem.\r\n\r\nMany pious pilgrims visit Medina, now the terminus of a railway, before\r\ngoing on to Mecca. This is another of the sacred cities of Islam, since\r\nit is the scene of Muhammad's labors after his hegira from Mecca; it\r\nalso contains his tomb. Formerly no unbeliever was permitted to traverse\r\nthe streets of Medina or look upon the tomb of the great prophet, but\r\ntourists are now allowed within the gates. The city is enclosed by a\r\nwall forty feet high which is flanked with thirty towers. Two of its\r\nfour gates are massive structures with double towers. Like Mecca, Medina\r\nis supported chiefly by pilgrims.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE SAHARA\r\n\r\n\r\nAn expanse of land as large as the main body of the United States\r\nstretches across the northern part of Africa. From the Atlantic Ocean to\r\nthe Red Sea, and from the foot of the Atlas Mountains to the Sudan, it\r\nis a weird panorama of rock waste--level, rugged, shingly, and\r\nmountainous, according to locality. In places only it is penetrated by\r\nlarge and permanently flowing streams. On the eastern borderland the\r\nNile pours a mighty flood, winding a sinuous passage along its\r\nself-made flood-plain, the Egypt of history. In the west the Niger has\r\nforced its way into the confines of the desert and then, as if rebuffed,\r\nturns its course southward.\r\n\r\nThis great domain of the simoom has every diversity of surface. The\r\nhigher summits of the Tarso Mountains are eight thousand feet above sea\r\nlevel; the Shott, a chain of salt lakes south of the Atlas Mountains,\r\nare about one hundred feet below sea level. The depression in which\r\nthese lakes is situated probably was once the head of the Gulf of Sidra;\r\nbut the never-ceasing winds have partly filled the depression, cutting\r\noff the head of the gulf in the same manner that wind-blown sands\r\nsevered what is now Imperial Valley from the Gulf of California. Around\r\nthe briny lakes are marshes of quicksands, and woe betide the luckless\r\ntraveller who strays to the one side or the other of the beaten trails.\r\nUnless help is at hand, life will have neither joys nor troubles for him\r\nafter a few brief minutes of struggle.\r\n\r\nThe Sahara proper begins at the south slope of the Atlas Mountains.\r\nWhere there are no Atlas Mountains, it begins almost at the\r\nMediterranean's edge. In the valleys of the Atlas and along the\r\nMediterranean coast there is a strip of fertile land, wide here, narrow\r\nthere, that produces grain and fruit. The Arabs call it the\r\n_Tell_. \"Beyond the Tell is Sah-ra,\" or the Sahara. This is the name\r\nwhich the Arabs apply to the archipelago of fertile spots, or oases.\r\nBeyond the zone of oases is the desert. One becomes instantly and\r\npainfully aware that it is a desert on leaving the last oasis. Go a\r\nthousand miles southward, eastward, or westward from Tripoli, and one\r\nencounters but a single thing--an ocean of orange-colored rock waste,\r\nthe Guebla of the Arabs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: On the sands of the desert]\r\n\r\nThe desert is a desert for want of water only. There is no lack of\r\nnutrition in the soil, nor is there anything in surface or temperature\r\nthat makes a desert unproductive. Temperature and winds reach great\r\nextremes in fierceness, however. The temperature of the air in the\r\nnoonday sun will often exceed one hundred and forty-five degrees; it may\r\nreach one hundred and fifty-five degrees. In the shade it frequently\r\nclimbs to one hundred and thirty degrees in the vicinity of the tropics.\r\nUnless one is at a considerable altitude there is not much relief at\r\nnight, though the thermometer may drop to ninety degrees. Farther north,\r\nhowever, and at an altitude of five thousand feet or more, the\r\ntemperature of the night is even more cruel than that of the day.\r\nImmediately after sunset a sharp chill becomes perceptible. At first it\r\nis a welcome relief from the intolerable heat. By nine o'clock it begins\r\nto cut like a stiletto, and at midnight the water suspended in shallow\r\ndishes clinks into ice. The drivers burrow deep into the sand and wrap\r\nwoollen baracans about them; the camels shiver and even blubber like\r\nwhipped bullies.\r\n\r\nThe air is so dry, however, that the extreme heat of day is by no means\r\ninsupportable. Sunstroke is almost unknown, and even the tragedy of\r\nperishing for want of water is very rare; for the caravan drivers know\r\njust where to find water, and there are many hidden watering places that\r\nare known to the crafty Tuaregs and Bedouins. Many of the watering\r\nplaces are wells that have been sunk in various localities along the\r\ncaravan trails. The intense heat, great depth of rock waste, and dry air\r\nare not favorable to the above-ground flow of rivers. But nearly every\r\nriver has an underground flow that is pretty likely to exist all the\r\nyear round.\r\n\r\nOne may follow a stream of considerable volume down the southern slope\r\nof the Atlas Mountains. The volume of water grows less and less until at\r\nlast it apparently disappears. Not all is lost by evaporation, however;\r\npossibly the greater part sinks into the porous rock waste. And the\r\nrock waste?--perhaps it may be twenty, fifty, or one hundred and fifty\r\nfeet deep. At all events, the water sinks until it reaches bed rock or\r\nclay through which it cannot pass. Then it flows along what may once\r\nhave been an above-ground channel until fierce winds and cloud-bursts\r\nburied it deep.\r\n\r\nBut the half-savage dwellers of the desert know just where to tap these\r\nunderground reservoirs and streams; even the dumb animals know\r\ninstinctively where to look for water. It is merely a question of\r\ninstinct coupled with experience, and the animal's judgment is about as\r\ngood as the man's. When one finds the spot, it is necessary only to dig.\r\nThe water may be two feet below the surface or it may be ten feet. When\r\nthe moist sand is reached the task is half over. A foot or two more and\r\nthe hole begins to fill. The water is hot, brackish, and repulsive to\r\nthe taste, but it is water--and in the desert, water is water!\r\n\r\nThe simoom is also an institution of the desert. The simoom is\r\nunmistakably a wind, and surely no one who has not had the experience\r\ncan appreciate it. Even the West India hurricanes or the typhoons of the\r\nChina Sea are more kindly. They have plenty of destructive energy, it is\r\ntrue, but the simoom has all this and much else besides. It comes not\r\nwithout warning, but the warning and the wind are not far apart. The\r\napproach of the simoom is a dense black cloud of whirling and seething\r\nfine dust. As it strikes one, the choking, suffocating blast of hot air\r\nand dust overcomes everything that has life. The caravan men and the\r\nanimals as well turn their backs to the wind and lie down with faces\r\nclose to the ground. In a minute or two the full strength of the blast\r\nis on and the simoom is picking up not only the fine rock waste, but the\r\ncoarser fragments as well, and is hurling them along at Empire State\r\nExpress velocity. One might as well try to face a hail of leaden\r\nbullets. It is a cruel blast that neither animal nor human being can\r\nwithstand. The camels crouch with their heads pointing away from the\r\nwind and nostrils close to the ground; their drivers lie prone with\r\nfaces in little hollows scooped in the sand.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the full blast of the simoom may last an hour--perhaps two or\r\neven three hours. In lighter strain it may continue a whole day. When,\r\nfinally, it ceases the air is thick with fine dust; one can see scarcely\r\na rod away. Sun and sky are hidden, and the blackness of a tornado or of\r\na London fog prevails. The fine dust floating in the air may not settle\r\nfor several days. Perhaps a week afterward there may be a haze that\r\npartly obscures the sun. The dust, finer than the finest flour, pervades\r\neverything in the desert. One's clothing is full of it; one's hair\r\nbecomes harsh and matted; the skin becomes rough, cracks and peels; the\r\neyes are inflamed; mouth, lips, and nostrils are swollen. But the great\r\nbodily discomfort resulting from the simoom does not last forever; it\r\ngives place to bodily irritation of some other sort, which is indeed a\r\ngrateful change merely because it is a change.\r\n\r\nThe sand dunes of the Sahara are interesting to those who are not\r\ncompelled to travel among them, but to the unfortunates who traverse\r\nthem they are almost heart-breaking. Imagine oneself standing on an\r\nelevation a few hundred feet higher than the surrounding country. There\r\nis but one landscape--waves upon waves of the loose rock waste, for\r\nconvenience called sand, as far as the eye can reach. Sometimes the\r\nwaves are in long windrows, but oftener they are short and choppy like\r\nthe surface waves of midocean.\r\n\r\nUnlike the ocean waves, in which only the form moves forward, while the\r\nwater composing it moves up and down only, the sand dune and the\r\nmaterial of which it is composed are both moving in the direction of\r\nthe wind. A breeze even of five or six miles an hour will keep the\r\nlighter surface dust moving freely, while a twelve-mile wind will not\r\nonly sweep along much larger particles but it also carries more of them.\r\nAnd just as the surface, or \"skin,\" friction forms waves at the surface\r\nof water, it also piles the desert sand in wave-like dunes.\r\n\r\nThe loose bits of rock waste are carried along, up the windward slope of\r\nthe dune until they roll over its crest, where, no longer impelled by\r\nthe wind, they come to rest. Thus, the crest, built forward by new\r\nmaterial constantly added, is advancing. Valleys are filled; old stream\r\nchannels are obliterated; and the inequalities of the surface are\r\nlevelled off until the whole landscape is one of shifting, drifting\r\nsand.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all these drawbacks, the Sahara and the arid lands\r\nsouthward to the Sudan are by no means destitute of life and wealth. It\r\nis an almost universal custom to speak of the barren condition of the\r\ndesert. The contrary is the truth; there is no soil elsewhere so fertile\r\nand productive. It is vastly superior even to the soil of the lands\r\nreclaimed from the bottom of the North Sea.\r\n\r\nWater is the magic wand that makes the sands of the Sahara bring forth\r\ncrops that are marvellous both in quantity and quality. No fruit grown\r\nelsewhere in the world can compare with that grown on desert lands, and\r\nthe French engineers are planning the means whereby water may be\r\nobtained. Surface water that is available to irrigate the wastes of the\r\nSahara does not exist. The level of the Nile is so far below the surface\r\non both sides of its own flood-plain that its waters cannot be used for\r\nthe reclamation of any part of the Libyan Desert, and the same is\r\npractically true of the Niger, which barely more than touches the\r\nborders of the Sahara. The few wadys, or \"dry washes,\" are destitute of\r\nwater except when a cloud-burst may fill them; but this happens at\r\nintervals of years only.\r\n\r\nThe engineer takes into his confidence a caravan driver--perhaps an\r\nArab, possibly a Berber, but quite as likely a slave. And the long\r\nexperience has taught the caravan man where to find the precious water.\r\nThe engineer then brings his science into play and drives an artesian\r\nwell. The well thus driven may be a \"gusher,\" but for most of them pumps\r\nare required to raise the water to the surface. The best well, however,\r\nfurnishes water enough to irrigate but a very small area. Indeed, all\r\nthe lands of the Sahara together irrigated by artesian wells would make\r\nan area scarcely larger than the State of Delaware, and all the water\r\nthus obtained would not supply New York City!\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the water obtained by artesian wells has proved a great\r\nblessing to the dwellers of the desert. If the water is found along one\r\nor another of the numerous caravan routes, an increase in caravan\r\ncommerce is apt to result, for along many routes the volume of caravan\r\ncommerce depends very largely on the number of wells. The location of\r\nartesian wells has also led to the opening of trade along new routes as\r\nwell, for wherever water can be found there will be camels to drink it.\r\n\r\nThe date palm is essentially a plant of the desert, or, rather, of the\r\noasis. Nowhere else does it grow in such profusion as in northern\r\nAfrica. The number of productive trees there is estimated to be anywhere\r\nfrom ten million to twenty million, though the estimate is but little\r\nbetter than a guess. At its full growth the date palm is a most\r\nbeautiful object. Usually the feathered tops of the trees are the only\r\nfoliage to relieve the harsh landscape. Like the bamboo, every part of\r\nthe tree is used. The leaves may be made into fans, or shredded and\r\nwoven into mats. The wood is used in making the framework of buildings,\r\nand the waste material is very handy as fuel. A refreshing fermented\r\ndrink and a most vile liquor are prepared from the juice. But the fruit,\r\nwhen properly prepared, is the chief food of many thousands of men and\r\nbeasts. Even the stones, or \"pits,\" of the dried fruit are useful; those\r\nwhich are not sent to Italy to be used for adulterating coffee are made\r\ninto an \"oil-meal\" for fodder.\r\n\r\nEsparto grass, called \"alfa\" or \"halfa\" by the Arabs, is another unique\r\nproduct of the Sahara. In spite of its name, it is not a grass but a\r\nflowering plant whose stalk has a tough fibre useful in making cordage\r\nand paper. When the plant turns brown and has become dry to the root,\r\nthe esparto picker gets busy.\r\n\r\nBy four o'clock in the morning he is at work, his heavy woollen baracan,\r\nor blanket, wrapped tightly about him, for the air is not only chilly\r\nbut almost freezing cold. By sunrise the chill begins to disappear, and\r\na few brief moments is the only interval between piercing chill and\r\nmidsummer heat. The baracan is quickly shed and the fez, if the picker\r\nis rich enough to possess one, is discarded for an esparto hat with rim\r\nof mammoth proportions. Esparto grass sandals protect his feet.\r\n\r\nAlmost all the animal life of the Sahara is deadly, and the esparto\r\ngrass picker is constantly facing danger. The clump of esparto, into the\r\nbottom of which he must reach to cut the mature stalks, is quite likely\r\nto be the lair of a poisonous viper; and if the reptile sinks its fangs\r\ninto the flesh of the unfortunate picker, long weeks of suffering and\r\ndisability--perhaps death--are in store for him. Between the bite of a\r\nrattler and that of an esparto viper there is little to choose.\r\n\r\nThe scorpion is another peril to the esparto picker. The great\r\nrock-scorpion of the Sahara is about as ugly as the centipede of Arizona\r\nand Mexico; in size it is also about as large--from six to ten inches\r\nin length. Its sting, too, is about as dangerous as the fangs of the\r\nrattler. But the esparto picker has a method of heroic treatment for\r\nboth the bite of the viper and the sting of the scorpion. He squats\r\ncalmly upon the sand while a brother picker cuts out the flesh that has\r\nbeen pierced. If he survives the twenty-four hours following, he is\r\npretty likely to pull through. If not--well, the vultures know when and\r\nwhere to look.\r\n\r\nThe esparto grass is delivered to the nearest local market compressed in\r\nbales of five or six hundred weight, held together by a coarse netting\r\nof esparto weave, and shipped to Europe. Nearly all of it goes to Great\r\nBritain. There it is shredded and made into cordage, coarse cloth, or\r\npaper.\r\n\r\nBut the esparto has a rival so far as its use in making paper is\r\nconcerned. The wood pulp of Norway and the United States is slowly\r\ndisplacing it, and in time esparto will be but little used except for\r\nmaking cordage or gunny cloth. Already the French Government is having\r\ntroubles of its own in providing employment for the esparto pickers, but\r\nit is not likely that such a useful plant will be discarded; on the\r\ncontrary, its use is likely to increase in the future.\r\n\r\nThe camel is the institution upon which the commerce of the desert\r\ndepends. A more awkward, ungainly beast can hardly be imagined--a\r\nshambling collection of humps, bumps, knobs, protruding joints, and\r\nsprawling legs seemingly attached to a head and neck in the near\r\nforeground. But that shambling gait will carry a load three times as\r\nheavy as the stoutest pack mule can bear, and it will carry it twice as\r\nfar in a day.\r\n\r\nA horse or a mule must be fed twice a day, but a camel will worry along\r\nfor a week at a time with nothing more substantial than its cud. Horses\r\nand mules cannot traverse regions where the watering places are more\r\nthan twelve hours apart, unless water be carried in storage; but the\r\ncamel is its own storage reservoir, and can carry a supply sufficient to\r\nlast for ten days.\r\n\r\nAt the end of his week of fasting the hump of the camel has shrunken to\r\na fraction of its former size. When the animal has a few days of feeding\r\nthe hump grows to its former proportions again. Indeed, the hump is\r\nmerely a mass of nutrition ready to be formed into flesh and blood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A caravan crossing the desert on the road to Jaffa]\r\n\r\nWithin the paunch of the animal and surrounding its stomach are great\r\nnumbers of cells capable of holding seven or eight gallons of water.\r\nWhen the camel drinks copiously these cells become filled and afterward\r\nslowly give up the water as the stomach requires. It may be truly said\r\nthat the camel is a camel because of the desert and not in spite of it.\r\n\r\nThe sparse population of the Sahara--Arabs, Berbers, and negroes--are\r\ndependent upon the camel, for until the railway shall traverse the\r\nSahara the camel will be practically the only means of transportation.\r\nThe camel's flesh furnishes about the only meat consumed by the dwellers\r\nof the desert, for ordinary cattle can live only in a few localities\r\nalong the desert border lands.\r\n\r\nThe native people of the desert are mainly of the race to which the\r\nArabs also belong, although there are many Arabs and negroes. The\r\nTuaregs and Bedouin Arabs are the best known. The Tuaregs are thought to\r\nbe the descendants of the Berbers and of the same race as the\r\nCarthaginians, whom the Romans many times defeated but never conquered.\r\nThey have whiter skins than the Arabs and in appearance are perhaps the\r\nfinest peoples of Africa. They are also the most ferocious and\r\nblood-thirsty villains on the face of the earth. Many of them live in\r\nthe white-walled cities such as Ghadames, Kand, and Timbuktu--all large\r\ncentres of population.\r\n\r\nTheir government is well organized. Each of the larger tribes is\r\ngoverned by a sultan, and in each there are several castes--a sort of\r\nnobility of unmixed Tuareg blood being at the head and negro slaves at\r\nthe lower end of the social ladder. The families of the highest caste\r\nare usually well-to-do, and both the men and the women are taught to\r\nread and write. The garments usually worn by a Tuareg man consist of\r\nwhite trousers, a gray tunic with white sleeves, sandals of ornamented\r\nleather, and a white turban. When away from home the Tuareg covers the\r\nlower half of the face by a cloth mask.\r\n\r\nThe usual occupation of the Tuaregs is twofold--to guard caravans or to\r\nrob them. The average Tuareg is perfectly indifferent as to which he\r\ndoes. A caravan from the Sudan enters, we will say, Kano. The garfla\r\nsheik pack master, or superintendent, goes at once to the financial\r\nagent of the sultan and pays the usual liken, or tariff charges. Then\r\nhe goes to the sultan himself and incidentally leaves in his possession\r\na generous money present. Then, if he desires, he may hire half a dozen\r\nor more guards.\r\n\r\nThe hiring of these will insure the caravan against theft or robbery on\r\nthe part of the predatory bands living at Kano. The guards will also\r\nfaithfully defend the caravan in case of attack by Bedouin Arabs. On the\r\nother hand, should the garfla sheik forget the present to the sultan, or\r\nneglect to hire guards, those same Tuaregs would be the first to attack\r\nand loot the caravan.\r\n\r\nThe Bedouin Arab is the chief trial of the caravans. He is always a foe\r\nto them; and although he ostensibly herds camels and horses, his real\r\noccupation is robbery and pillage. For days nomadic Arabs will follow a\r\ncaravan, keeping always out of sight. Most likely a band of a dozen or\r\nmore mounted on swift horses will survey the caravan from a distance at\r\nwhich they are not likely to be discovered. Then they make their way\r\nahead of it to some point where a dune or a gully will conceal them.\r\nThen, just as the end of the caravan drags by, there is a sudden sortie\r\nand a rattling musket fire. And before the guards can gather to the\r\ndefence half a dozen camels are cut out of the train, a driver or two is\r\nshot down or pierced with assegais, and both the robbers and their loot\r\nare beyond the reach of the guards.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the greatest value of the desert is its effect upon the\r\nclimate of Europe. Hot winds blow from the Sahara in all directions; the\r\nnortherly winds, crossing the Mediterranean, are not only tempered\r\nthereby, but the desert blasts tempered and filled with moisture finally\r\nreach the southern slopes of Europe, where they convert the nutrition of\r\nthe soil into bountiful crops of corn, wine, and oil.\r\n\r\nThe conquest of the great African desert is already in sight, and the\r\nrailway will be its master. The Cape to Cairo line is no longer a vision\r\nof the future; the ends of its two parts are rapidly shortening the\r\ninterval that separates them and they are almost in sight of each other.\r\nWhen the lines that are projected from the Mediterranean coast shall\r\nhave traversed the stronghold of the Tuaregs to penetrate the wealth of\r\nthe Sudan and the Kongo, the Sahara will have become merely an incident.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nPOLAR REGIONS--THE CONQUEST OF THE ARCTIC\r\n\r\n\r\nExcepting the arctic and the antarctic regions, with their\r\nfortifications of eternal ice and snow, intrepid explorers have made\r\nknown nearly every part of the world. There Giant Frost guards his\r\nfrozen secrets and defies man to wrest them from him. Many a hero has\r\nperished in endeavoring to solve the Sphinx-like riddle of northern\r\nlands and seas. Many a gallant ship has found its grave in northern\r\nice-clad waters. Yet there has never been a lack of adventurous spirits\r\nto continue the work.\r\n\r\nBut one after another the strongholds of nature have gradually yielded\r\nto persistent attacks. Especially is this true of the arctic regions, of\r\nwhich not more than two million square miles of sea and land remain to\r\nbe explored.\r\n\r\nBuffeted by adverse winds and floating ice-fields, venturous explorers\r\nhave drawn nearer and nearer to the north pole. Again and again, the\r\nattack has been renewed, until, after half a lifetime, Robert E. Peary,\r\nan officer of the United States navy, made a brilliant dash and planted\r\nthe national ensign at the pole.\r\n\r\nThe story of arctic exploration and discovery is filled with interest.\r\nIt is pathetic, tragical, and calculated to awaken the deepest emotions.\r\nNevertheless, it is enlivened by brilliant exploits, deeds of daring,\r\nand acts of heroism.\r\n\r\nFor many years the search for a northern passage to India in the\r\nfurtherance of commerce was the chief incentive to arctic exploration.\r\nEven more than a century before Columbus discovered America, two\r\nVenetian brothers named Zeno sought a northwest passage to the Orient,\r\nbelieving that the difficulties in navigating it would be offset by the\r\nshortening of the route.\r\n\r\nThe success achieved by Spain during the fifteenth and sixteenth\r\ncenturies in discovery, conquest, and colonization incited England to\r\nfind a northwest passage, in the hope that such a route, by shortening\r\nthe distance to the East Indies, would extend her commerce.\r\n\r\nAfter the discovery of the mainland of North America, Sebastian Cabot,\r\nunder the patronage of Henry VII, planned a voyage to the north pole,\r\nthinking that would be the best route to ancient Cathay. He proceeded\r\nonly as far as Davis Strait; then, becoming discouraged by the immense\r\nfields of ice, he turned the prow of his vessel homeward.\r\n\r\nSoon afterward the Muscovy Company of London sent out an exploring\r\nexpedition with instructions to find a northwest passage. This\r\nexpedition, taking a different route from its predecessors, reached Nova\r\nZembla. But the ice-fields forced the vessel back to the shores of\r\nLapland, and the ship was never spoken of again. Years afterward the ship's\r\ncompany were found frozen in death.\r\n\r\nNext in importance came the renowned Frobisher, a strong advocate of a\r\nnorthwest route. He made three voyages to the Arctic Ocean, the last two\r\nbeing under the patronage of Queen Elizabeth. Frobisher believed that\r\nfabulously rich fields of gold existed in the north, and his expedition\r\nwas organized for the purpose of discovering them. His search for\r\nprecious metals was fruitless, but he added much to the world's\r\nknowledge of polar regions, and he has been remembered in the strait\r\nthat bears his name.\r\n\r\nThe Muscovy Company again sent out an exploring vessel, this time under\r\nthe able navigator Henry Hudson, with orders to go \"direct to the north\r\npole.\" He did his best to carry out his instructions and, sailing along\r\nthe northern shore of Spitzbergen, reached latitude 81° 30' north.\r\nFinding the route utterly impracticable, he returned home. In all,\r\nHudson sailed on four voyages of discovery, twice in the employ of\r\nEnglish companies and twice in the employ of the Dutch East India\r\nCompany.\r\n\r\nIn one of his voyages under the Dutch, after advancing as far north as\r\nhe deemed prudent, he turned southward and cruised along the Atlantic\r\ncoast. Entering New York Bay, he proceeded up the broad river that now\r\nbears his name, believing at first that he had found the coveted short\r\nroute to India. Soon he was undeceived, for as he went farther up he\r\nfound the seeming passage to be merely a large river. He gave his\r\nemployers such a glowing account of the valley of the Hudson River that\r\nthe merchants of Holland sent out ships to establish trading posts along\r\nthe river and to trade with the Indians.\r\n\r\nOn his fourth voyage, while seeking a passage northwest, he discovered\r\nthe strait and the bay both of which bear his name. Desiring to continue\r\nhis explorations the next year, he sailed westward on the bay and\r\nwintered on the island of Southampton. In the spring he again tried to\r\nfind the long-wished-for passage.\r\n\r\nThe long, cold winter and lack of suitable food told heavily on his men.\r\nThey became badly demoralized and declared that they would not remain\r\nlonger in such an inhospitable region. When Hudson insisted, the men\r\nmutinied. Seizing their commander, they placed him with his son and\r\nfive sailors in an open boat and sailed away. After this cruel act of\r\nthe mutineers, no trace of Hudson or those who were with him was ever\r\nfound. But Hudson's fame will never die. Historians will ever laud his\r\nachievements, and his name is indelibly inscribed on the map of the\r\nworld. The ringleader of the mutineers with five of his companions was\r\nafterward killed by the natives, and several of the others starved to\r\ndeath. The rest of the crew succeeded in getting the ship back to\r\nEngland; there they were tried, found guilty of mutiny, and sent to\r\nprison.\r\n\r\nIn 1616 the intrepid William Baffin took up the search. He penetrated\r\nthe bay bearing his name and explored the passages of water westward to\r\nthe mouth of Lancaster Sound.\r\n\r\nLater the Russians became interested in exploration. Among the explorers\r\nCaptain Veit Bering of the Russian navy was the most eminent. In the\r\nearly part of the eighteenth century Bering was commanded by Peter the\r\nGreat to take up the search for the long-sought passage. He explored the\r\nnortheastern coast of Asia as far north as sixty-seven degrees latitude,\r\ndiscovering a fact hitherto unknown, that North America is separated\r\nfrom Asia by a narrow passage of water containing small islands. The\r\npassage received the name Bering Strait from its discoverer, and the\r\nsame name was bestowed upon the sea leading to it.\r\n\r\nAbout ten years afterward Bering determined to explore the northwest\r\ncoast of North America. He landed twice upon the coast, but, being\r\ndriven back by violent storms, was at length wrecked on an island, where\r\nhe died. His crew, though suffering terrible hardships, lived through\r\nthe winter. With the coming of spring, however, they rigged a craft from\r\nthe stranded vessel in which a few survivors reached the coast of Asia.\r\n\r\nIn 1743 the British Government offered a reward of twenty thousand\r\npounds for the discovery of a northwest passage by the way of Hudson\r\nBay. Thirty-three years afterward a like reward was offered for the\r\nactual discovery of the north pole and the same amount for the\r\nexploration of any navigable passage. The sum of five thousand pounds\r\nwas also offered to any one who should approach within one degree of the\r\nnorth pole. These standing rewards greatly stimulated arctic\r\nexploration.\r\n\r\nOf the many voyages of exploration that followed, Sir John Franklin's\r\nlast expedition was the most tragical. This expedition was fitted out by\r\nthe British Government with the necessary supplies and scientific\r\ninstruments for a three years' cruise. Two stanch vessels, the _Erebus_\r\nand the _Terror_, both of which had been previously employed in\r\nantarctic exploration, were selected to stem the ice-fields of the\r\nnorth, and a tender with extra supplies accompanied them as far as Davis\r\nStrait. The vessels were last seen in Lancaster Sound moored to an\r\niceberg, where they were spoken to by a whaling ship homeward bound.\r\n\r\nThree years having passed and no tidings having been received from the\r\nexpedition, all England became extremely anxious concerning the safety\r\nof the explorers. The British Government then sent out two vessels to\r\nseek Franklin, but no trace of the missing commander or his men was\r\nfound.\r\n\r\nThe government then redoubled its exertions, supplemented by private\r\nparties, and in 1850 no less than twelve vessels were vigorously\r\nsearching the arctic lands and waters for their lost brothers. Lady\r\nFranklin spent her fortune in endeavoring to find trace of her noble\r\nhusband.\r\n\r\nThe heart of humanity was touched with the deepest sympathy and moved by\r\nthe noblest motives. The United States Government, aided also by private\r\ncitizens, fitted out vessels to continue the search. At one time ten of\r\nthe searching vessels met in the Arctic. The results of these\r\nexpeditions were meagre in securing trace of the lost ones, but they\r\ngreatly enriched our knowledge of northern lands and seas.\r\n\r\nNot until five years after the _Erebus_ and _Terror_ left England was\r\ntrace of the explorers found. Near the head of Franklin Strait, off the\r\nshore of King William Land, evidence of an encampment of some of the men\r\nwas discovered, and at Beechey Island, near by, carpenters' tools, empty\r\nmeat cans, and the graves of three of the men threw more light on the\r\nmystery of the ill-starred expedition. A few years later, at Victory\r\nPoint, Lieutenant Hobson found a record of the death of Franklin, the\r\ndate being July 11, 1847.\r\n\r\nCharles F. Hall, a native of New Hampshire, but long a resident of Ohio,\r\nwho had been a reader of arctic literature, became deeply interested in\r\nthe search for Sir John Franklin. Obtaining financial aid from different\r\nsources, he made four voyages to the arctic, the first being devoted to\r\nsearching for Franklin's men and in solving the mystery of their\r\ndisappearance. His third voyage was the most fruitful one in securing\r\nresults. Hall believed that the Eskimos knew more about the lost\r\nexplorers than they were willing to tell, and that if he could but gain\r\ntheir confidence he could extract from them the story. In furtherance of\r\nhis plan, he resolved on his third voyage to live with them several\r\nyears. In 1864 he started on this voyage north. On his arrival in the\r\narctic he sought out the natives and made himself one of them, adopting\r\ntheir mode of life and food.\r\n\r\nHe spent five years living and travelling with them. Having won them\r\nover, he obtained the story of the ill-fated explorers. He learned that\r\none of Franklin's vessels had actually made the northwest passage to\r\nO'Reily Island, southwest of King William Land. Five men remained on\r\nboard alive, but the vessel was abandoned by the crew. The next spring\r\nthe Eskimos found it in good condition frozen fast in the ice.\r\n\r\nThe skeletons of Franklin's men were found scattered over King William\r\nLand, where they had perished one after another from starvation and\r\ncold. Some had engaged in conflict with the natives in endeavoring to\r\nsecure food, but being weak from hunger were unsuccessful. Of the one\r\nhundred and five men who accompanied Franklin not one was ever found\r\nalive.\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1850 the problem of the northwest passage was solved by\r\nCaptains M'Clure, Collinson, and Killet. South of Melville Island,\r\nM'Clure, who had sailed through Bering Strait, met the ship of Killet\r\nwhich had come through Lancaster Sound. M'Clure, having wintered near\r\nthe connecting waters, had really established the existence of the\r\npassage by observation before the meeting. Twenty days later Collinson\r\ncame up in his ship. Finding the problem of the northwest passage\r\nsolved, he turned to the southeast and completed the passage in another\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nIt thus became evident that so far as commercial purposes were concerned\r\na northwest passage was impracticable and that further northern\r\nexploration must be considered in the light of scientific and geographic\r\nvalue only.\r\n\r\nHall's labors did not cease with his discovery of the Franklin\r\nexpedition. He became an enthusiast concerning the arctic and seemed to\r\nenjoy its weird icy scenery and attendant perilous excitement. Believing\r\nthat he could reach the north pole if he had a properly equipped\r\nexpedition, he planned a fourth voyage and appealed to Congress for\r\nassistance.\r\n\r\nA generous appropriation was made by Congress, and on July 3, 1871, the\r\nexpedition set sail from New London, Conn., carrying a full crew and\r\nseveral scientists. The vessel, which was named the _Polaris_, touched\r\nat several places on the western coast of Greenland to secure\r\nadditional dogs and skins suitable for arctic clothing, and then steamed\r\nnorth as far as seemed safe, to establish winter quarters preparatory to\r\nmaking a dash for the pole in the spring.\r\n\r\nThe vessel passed through Robeson Channel into the polar ocean, reaching\r\n82° 11', then the highest point ever reached by a ship. Not finding a\r\ngood harbor, Hall sailed south about fifty miles. He anchored near the\r\nGreenland shore to the lee of a stranded iceberg. Building material for\r\na house and part of the stores were removed to the land in case anything\r\nhappened to the ship. Then the ship was banked up with snow and part of\r\nthe deck was covered with canvas to keep out the cold.\r\n\r\nThe weather being propitious, Captain Hall thought best to take a sledge\r\njourney to find the lay of the country. He ordered the dogs to be well\r\nfed, and accompanied by two other sledges advanced northward about fifty\r\nmiles, making side trips to take observations. At the end of two weeks\r\nhe returned seemingly perfectly well, but in a few hours complained of\r\nillness. Thirteen days afterward he died. The date of his death was\r\nNovember 8, 1871, just a little more than four months from the time he\r\nleft the port of New London buoyant with hope.\r\n\r\nThe command of the expedition now devolved on Captain Buddington, a man\r\nof dissipated habits and lacking in discipline. During the winter and\r\nspring severe storms crashed the ice-pack against the sides of the\r\nvessel, causing it to leak. In the meantime exploring parties were sent\r\nout with sledges and boats, gathering not a little knowledge concerning\r\nthe west coast of Greenland. Then the vessel began to leak badly, and\r\nCaptain Buddington ordered all hands on board for return home.\r\n\r\nGreat fields of ice still covered the sea, and it was with extreme\r\ndifficulty that the vessel made its way through them southward. A\r\nsevere gale damaged the vessel still more, and as it seemed certain that\r\nit could not float much longer, preparations to abandon it and to move\r\nat once to the ice-floe were made.\r\n\r\nAt the dead of night, in the face of a fierce gale, a part of the ship's\r\ncompany and stores were transferred to the ice. Then the heaving billows\r\nbroke the vessel loose from the floe, separating the men on the ice from\r\nthose on the vessel. With eighteen companions Captain Tyson lived on the\r\nice-floe which moved southward, breaking off piece after piece, for a\r\nperiod of six and one-half months, suffering incredible hardships from\r\ncold, hunger, and constant fear. Finally, they were sighted off the\r\nLabrador coast by the ship _Tigress_ and rescued in a starving\r\ncondition. The story of this ice-floe journey of one thousand three\r\nhundred miles is one of the most thrilling in maritime annals.\r\nFortunately, there were two Eskimos on the ice-floe skilled in the\r\ncapture of seals, else the entire company would have starved to death,\r\nsince but a small portion of the provisions had been transferred to the\r\nfloe when the vessel parted from it. The devices for sustaining their\r\nlives during the journey form interesting reading. Strange to relate, no\r\none was seriously ill and no deaths occurred during this remarkable ice\r\nvoyage.\r\n\r\nAfter drifting a while the _Polaris_ was purposely beached on the\r\nGreenland shore and the stores placed on land, where a house was built\r\nin which to spend the second winter. In the spring two boats were\r\nconstructed in which the company started southward along the coast,\r\nwhere they were finally picked up by a whaling vessel.\r\n\r\nThe conquest of the northeast passage was not achieved until the latter\r\npart of the century. In 1878 Baron Nordenskjold, a Swedish explorer\r\ncommanding the _Vega_, entered the Arctic and sailed eastward along the\r\nRussian and Siberian coast. Nordenskjold was the first navigator to\r\ndouble Cape Chelyuskin, the northern cape of Asia. The _Vega_ reached\r\nBering Strait where she was nipped by the ice-pack. In the following\r\nspring she reached Japan in safety.\r\n\r\nIn 1879-80 Lieutenant Frederick Schwatka set out on an overland\r\nexpedition northwestward for Hudson Bay, to gather knowledge concerning\r\nthe great Arctic Plain of North America. Schwatka's was probably the\r\nlongest sledge journey ever made up to that time. With a small party of\r\nmen, his dog sledges covered a distance of three thousand miles.\r\nSchwatka found the skeletons of several members of Sir John Franklin's\r\nparty. These he buried on King William Land.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Peary's ship, the _Roosevelt_]\r\n\r\nIn 1881 the De Long expedition, in the steam cruiser _Jeannette_, met\r\ndisaster off the Siberian coast. The _Jeannette_ was sunk and her\r\nofficers and crew in three boats abandoned her. One boat was never\r\nheard of afterward. De Long and his party starved in the delta swamps of\r\nthe Lena River. Chief Engineer Melville and his party were rescued in\r\nthe Lena River.\r\n\r\nIn 1881 also the International Polar Conference attempted to establish a\r\nchain of stations around the pole as far north as possible. The United\r\nStates and several of the European nations were represented in the\r\norganization. Two expeditions were sent out by the United States; one at\r\nPoint Barrow, under Lieutenant Ray, the other at Lady Franklin Bay,\r\nopposite the Greenland coast, in latitude 81° 40'. The latter was in\r\ncharge of Lieutenant, now General Greely. In a sledge journey along the\r\nnorth coast of Greenland, Lockwood and Brainard reached the latitude of\r\n83° 24'. The observations of Greely and Ray added not a little knowledge\r\nconcerning the meteorology and tides of the arctic regions. The sledge\r\njourney of Lockwood and Brainard practically established the fact that\r\nGreenland is an island.\r\n\r\nOf all attempts to reach the pole, the most daring was that adopted by\r\nS. A. Andree, a Swedish explorer. Andree had been to the polar regions\r\nbefore, and being something of an aeronaut, believed that he could reach\r\nor pass over the pole in a balloon. In carrying out his plan he had\r\nconstructed a monster balloon capable of floating in the air thirty\r\ndays, due allowance being made for the daily escape of gas by permeation\r\nthrough the envelope. This balloon, with necessary accessories, was\r\nshipped to Danes Island, one of the Spitzbergen group. Everything being\r\nready July 11, 1897, Andree set forth on his perilous trip accompanied\r\nby two companions. The balloon carried a load of about five tons,\r\nincluding food, clothing, ballast, scientific instruments, and men.\r\n\r\nOn being let loose the balloon arose six hundred feet, and then\r\ndescended to the surface of the sea owing to the entanglement of the\r\nguide ropes and ballast lines. Three heavy guide ropes nine hundred feet\r\nlong were used, to which were attached eight ballast lines two hundred\r\nand fifty feet long. The ropes were cut and ballast was thrown out, when\r\nthe balloon again rose and the wind bore it away over a mountainous\r\nisland one thousand five hundred feet high. In an hour it had passed\r\nbelow the northeastern horizon. Three message buoys were dropped on the\r\nday of Andree's departure, reporting fine weather, all well, and\r\naltitude eight hundred and twenty feet; from that time on no traces of\r\nthe daring unfortunates have ever been found.\r\n\r\nFridtjof Nansen, who had spent some time in the exploration of\r\nGreenland, had also reached the conclusion that a polar current sweeps\r\nacross the Arctic Ocean from Bering Sea to the north coast of Greenland.\r\nHe therefore set out with a picked crew in a small steamship, the\r\n_Fram_,1893, entering the Arctic at Bering Strait. After the _Fram_ had\r\nbeen caught in the ice-pack, Nansen and his companion, Johansen, started\r\ntoward the north pole with dog sledges. They reached latitude 86° 14';\r\nfinding that the ice was drifting southward, they made for Franz Josef\r\nLand, where they spent the winter, and then started for Spitzbergen. On\r\ntheir way they were found by members of the Jackson-Harmsworth\r\nexpedition, by whom they were rescued. The _Fram_ also returned safely.\r\nThe existence of the polar current was not established.\r\n\r\nIn 1900 Captain Cagui, a member of the Abruzzi Polar Expedition,\r\nstarting from Franz Josef Land, made a dash across the ice toward the\r\npole. He succeeded in reaching latitude 86° 34', the nearest approach to\r\nthe pole up to that time.\r\n\r\nOnly a few years afterward, 1905-6, Amundsen, in the steamer _Gjoa_,\r\nfound a more southerly northwest passage from King William Land than\r\nthat followed by Collinson. It was comparatively free from ice. Amundsen\r\nwas the first to penetrate the northwest passage in a continuous voyage.\r\nThe result showed plainly that as a commercial route the northwest\r\npassage was out of the question.\r\n\r\nThe man who finally succeeded in reaching the pole is the intrepid\r\narctic explorer, Robert E. Peary, of the United States navy. In the\r\nfirst record-breaking trip Peary started in July, 1905. Sailing through\r\nDavis Strait, Baffin Bay, Smith Sound, and Robeson Channel to Grant\r\nIsland, which lies west of the northern part of Greenland, he went into\r\nwinter quarters at Cape Sheridan.\r\n\r\nIn the early spring, when the daylight was an hour long, Peary set out\r\nfor the north pole over the ice-clad ocean with sledges drawn by dogs.\r\nDelayed by storms and open water in some places, he succeeded after\r\nincredible hardships and suffering in reaching 87° 6', the highest point\r\nup to that time reached by man, a distance only two hundred miles from\r\nthe north pole.\r\n\r\nIn previous trips Peary had crossed the northern part of Greenland twice\r\nat the risk of his life, each time bringing much knowledge of the north\r\ncoast of Greenland. During one of his voyages Peary brought home three\r\nmeteorites. The largest, weighing more than thirty-six tons, is now in\r\nthe Museum of Natural History of New York City. These are among the\r\nlargest meteorites ever found, and it is an interesting fact that so\r\nmany were found in Greenland.[1]\r\n\r\nPeary's last and successful trip began when the steamship Roosevelt,\r\ncommanded by Captain Bartlett, sailed out of New York harbor, July 6,\r\n1908. The vessel traversed Baffin Bay and reached Cape York August 1. At\r\nEtah, an Eskimo settlement, three weeks were consumed in storing\r\nsupplies and selecting Eskimo guides and purchasing dog-trains. The\r\nRoosevelt then proceeded northward through the narrow strait that\r\nseparates Greenland from Grant Land. The party went into winter quarters\r\nnear Cape Sheridan at the head of the strait. The winter was spent in\r\nexploration and in preparation for the sledge journey. The necessary\r\nsupplies for the journey were carried to Cape Columbia, the northerly\r\npoint of Grant Land. The sledge party started northward from Cape\r\nColumbia February 28--seven members of the expedition, seventeen\r\nEskimos, and nineteen sledges.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Commander Robert E. Peary and three of his Eskimo dogs on\r\nthe Roosevelt]\r\n\r\nWhen the expedition reached latitude eighty-eight degrees, Captain\r\nBartlett and Professor Marvin, with most of the Eskimo guides, were\r\nordered back; Peary with his companion, Hensen, and several Eskimos\r\nstarted on the final dash. Fortunately the ice was smooth, and but few\r\nbreaks, or \"leads,\" were encountered. It was not difficult to make\r\ntwenty-five miles or more a day during several days of the journey. At\r\nlast a temporary break in the clouds gave Peary an opportunity for\r\nobservation, which showed his latitude to be 89° 57'. Ten miles more\r\nwere made, and another observation showed that the party had actually\r\ngone several miles beyond the pole.\r\n\r\nA cairn of ice blocks and snow bearing the American flag was erected\r\napproximately at the pole, April 7, 1909, and the party started on the\r\nreturn trip. There being a plain trail and smooth ice, the return trip\r\nwas made in about half the time required for the outward trip. The\r\nreserve party was joined at Cape Columbia, and all hands returned to the\r\n_Roosevelt_, which was at anchor near Cape Sheridan. The only fatality\r\nof the expedition was the death of Professor Marvin, who was\r\naccidentally drowned while on his return to Cape Columbia.\r\n\r\nThe open polar sea which had been observed by Kane and several other\r\nexplorers was closed by ice at the time of Peary's dash; indeed, the\r\nentire route lay over ice and snow that apparently was several years\r\nold. After leaving Cape Columbia no land sky was seen anywhere about\r\nthe horizon. A single sounding was made about five miles from the pole,\r\nbut no bottom was found at fifteen hundred feet, the length of the\r\nsounding wire.\r\n\r\nFor his services Peary received the medal of the Royal Geographical\r\nSociety, and an admiral's commission from the United States Government.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the desolation that pervades polar regions, the resources\r\nare considerable and have attracted much commercial activity. For many\r\nyears whale oil was about the only illuminating oil used by most of the\r\nworld, and the chief supply was obtained from the whales slaughtered in\r\nnorth polar regions.\r\n\r\nHolland sent whaling ships to the arctic as early as 1613, and for two\r\ncenturies whaling fleets of different nations frequented these seas.\r\nDuring the early part of the seventeenth century--the most profitable\r\nperiod--upward of three hundred Dutch ships and fifteen thousand men\r\nannually visited Spitzbergen. It is estimated that in two centuries\r\nAmerica, England, and Holland obtained from the arctic regions products\r\namounting to one thousand million dollars, the greatest items by far\r\nbeing whale oil and whalebone. Great quantities of fossil ivory have\r\nbeen obtained from the New Siberian Island, the very soil of which seems\r\nin great part to be made up of the bones and tusks of the extinct\r\nmammoth.\r\n\r\nMuch valuable scientific information has been gained by meteorological\r\nand magnetic observations. The north magnetic pole, toward which the\r\nnorth-seeking end of the compass needle points, has been located on the\r\nwest side of Boothia Peninsula. At this place the dipping needle stands\r\nvertical. It must be borne in mind that the north pole of the earth and\r\nthe north magnetic pole are two entirely different points. As a matter\r\nof fact, if the mariner be in the arctic waters north of Boothia\r\nPeninsula his compass points south.\r\n\r\nThe arctic currents have been carefully studied with valuable results,\r\nand it has been found that the drift of the polar ice-floe is constantly\r\nto the eastward. Snow-white arctic reindeer in considerable numbers have\r\nbeen recently found; and Peary found seals within two hundred miles of\r\nthe north pole. The Greenland seal seems to enjoy seas filled with ice,\r\nspending part of the time in the water and part on the ice-floe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Musk ox]\r\n\r\nIt is now known that Greenland is an ice-capped island very sparsely\r\ninhabited along the coast by Eskimos. A few hundred of these hardy\r\npeople live along the Greenland coast from Cape York up to latitude\r\nseventy-eight degrees, cut off by the surrounding ice-cap from the rest\r\nof the world. They are the most northern known inhabitants.\r\n\r\nPeary found the northern coast of Greenland well stocked with both\r\nanimal and vegetable life. Bears, wolves, hares, and musk oxen were seen\r\nin considerable numbers.\r\n\r\nA most important fact discovered by Hall was that the most northerly\r\npart of Greenland is comparatively free from ice, the largest known area\r\nof bare ground of that continent. This fact accounts for the profusion\r\nof animal and vegetable life existing there.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting of land animals found in the north is the\r\nmusk ox. When fully grown and in good condition this animal weighs five\r\nhundred pounds and upward. When the musk oxen are attacked by wolves or\r\ndogs they form themselves into a circle with their heads on the outside\r\nand conceal their calves under their bodies. Their hair, being long,\r\nreaches nearly to the ground and forms a curtain which completely\r\nconceals the calves from view. Their food is moss and lichens which grow\r\non the rocks. This they obtain by scraping away the snow with their\r\nsharp hoofs. The flesh of the musk ox, though musk-like in flavor, is\r\nnot repulsive to the taste, and several explorers have been saved from\r\nstarving by using the flesh for food.\r\n\r\nThe chief obstacles to arctic exploration are the long winter night,\r\nduring which all must remain idle, and the necessity for carrying all\r\nprovisions. No one who has not wintered beyond the arctic circle can\r\nhave a realization of the influence on the nerves of continual darkness\r\nfor months, an influence that has driven many men insane. Combine the\r\ndarkness with the weird scenery and the fierce storms that prevail\r\nduring the long winter, and it requires a strong will and abiding faith\r\nnot to be seriously influenced. The extreme cold is not hard to endure\r\nif one clothes himself in the manner of the Eskimos.\r\n\r\nProvisions and supplies must be carried by dog sledges, and the\r\nmanagement of the dog teams is very difficult for those who have not\r\nbeen trained to the work. Shetland ponies have been tried as draught\r\nanimals. Captain Evelyn Baldwin was the first to use them in polar\r\nexploration; others have used them, but less successfully.\r\n\r\nGood coal is found in abundance on many of the islands of the arctic.\r\nIts outcroppings are found on Disco Island, west of Greenland, and\r\nexcellent coal is found in many places in Spitzbergen, where at the\r\npresent time two companies are mining it, one American and the other\r\nEnglish.\r\n\r\nSpitzbergen is sometimes called No Man's Land, since Norway and Sweden\r\nhave not been able to agree in regard to its possession. Lately the\r\nislands of this archipelago have become favorite resorts for summer\r\nexcursionists who can here have the arctic scenery and experiences with\r\nbut very few discomforts. Ptarmigan, geese, ducks, and many other kinds\r\nof birds are found on these islands. Large quantities of eider-down have\r\nbeen obtained annually from this section, but the rapid destruction of\r\nthe ducks by hunters has lessened the industry and will probably\r\nannihilate it. There being no law to regulate hunting, sportsmen\r\nwantonly kill the wild animals, especially the reindeer and bears, in\r\ngreat numbers.\r\n\r\nWe owe much to dogs in arctic explorations. It would have been\r\nimpossible to penetrate to the interior of arctic lands or to traverse\r\nthe frozen seas but for the services of the faithful dogs trained to\r\ndraw sledges. Many of these animals have suffered from overwork and have\r\nperished from starvation; others have been sacrificed for food in dire\r\nextremities to preserve the lives of their masters. Surely arctic\r\nservice has proved as destructive to the poor dogs as to men.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Isolated masses of native iron are usually of meteoric\r\norigin, but to determine whether or not the native iron fell from the\r\nsky a portion of the surface is ground off and polished; then the\r\npolished surface is etched with acid. If crystalline lines are plainly\r\nbrought out, there can be no doubt of its being of meteoric origin.\r\n\r\nThe following excerpt from the American Museum Meteoric Guide will make\r\nthe matter clear: \"The iron of meteorites is always alloyed with from\r\nsix to twenty per cent of nickel. This 'nickel-iron,' as it is commonly\r\ncalled, is usually crystalline in texture, and when it is cut, polished,\r\nand 'etched' a beautiful net-work of lines is brought out, indicating\r\nplates which lie in positions determined by the crystalline character of\r\nthe mass. This net-work of lines constitutes what are called the\r\nWidmannstattian figures, from the name of their discoverer. When these\r\nfigures are strongly developed the meteoric origin of the iron cannot be\r\nquestioned, but their absence does not necessarily disprove such an\r\norigin. Native iron of terrestrial origin is extremely rare.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nPOLAR REGIONS--ANTARCTICA\r\n\r\n\r\nA continent twice the size of the United States lies sleeping beneath a\r\nmantle of snow and ice at the south pole. No vegetation save a few\r\nmosses and lichens exists anywhere on this vast expanse. No four-footed\r\nanimals rove over it; no human beings inhabit it.\r\n\r\nHundreds of thousands of square miles of pack-ice, glaciers, and\r\nice-walls jealously guard it on all sides. On one side, for a distance\r\nof five hundred miles, extends a great ice barrier whose perpendicular\r\nice-wall is from thirty to three hundred feet in height. Behind this\r\nwall are vast ice-fields, and beyond these immense plateaus of ice\r\nhaving an elevation of six thousand to twelve thousand feet where fierce\r\nwinds and a biting cold prevail. On these elevated plains the\r\nthermometer stands in the middle of summer sometimes as low as forty\r\ndegrees below zero.\r\n\r\nGreat fields of ice and huge icebergs cover the sea in all directions\r\nand in winter extend far beyond the antarctic circle. In these regions\r\nthe ice forming on the surface of the ocean attains a thickness varying\r\nfrom five to seventeen feet. Long ranges of snow-clad and ice-mailed\r\nmountains are found with ermined peaks towering from ten thousand to\r\nfifteen thousand feet in height.\r\n\r\nA long winter night, with its intense darkness relieved at times by the\r\nlight of the moon and brilliant chromatic displays of the aurora\r\naustralis, succeeds a day of perpetual sunshine. All these are on such a\r\nscale of sublimity that no pen can adequately describe nor brush portray\r\nthem. Nowhere else on the face of the globe does there exist such a wide\r\nexpanse of utter desolation. Yet an undefined attraction lures bold men\r\nto fathom the mysteries of these forbidding regions. Dating from 1772,\r\nmany exploring expeditions have visited the south polar regions in the\r\ninterests of science.\r\n\r\nThe compass is the mariner's guide across the trackless ocean, and it is\r\nessential to find out everything possible about that mysterious agent,\r\nmagnetism, which directs the compass needle by its attractive force. The\r\nearth itself is a huge magnet with positive and negative poles. The\r\npoised needle of the compass maintains its relative position because of\r\nthe magnetic poles of the earth, one located in the north polar regions,\r\non the western side of the peninsula of Boothia, and the other in the\r\nsouth polar regions, on Victoria Land. Except in a few localities the\r\ncompass needle does not point due north and south--that is, toward the\r\nreal poles of the earth, but toward the magnetic poles. And these\r\nmagnetic poles are ever shifting, as is shown by the changing direction\r\nof the compass needle, which year by year increases or decreases its\r\ndeviation from true north and south.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to chart the variations of the magnetic needle for the\r\nuse of the navigator. To observe the deviations and to locate the south\r\nmagnetic pole have been the chief objects of south polar expeditions for\r\nseveral years, geographical information being of secondary importance.\r\n\r\nThe marine life of the south polar regions is abundant. In the latter\r\npart of the eighteenth century ships sailing in the regions north of the\r\nantarctic circle discovered whales and fur-bearing seals. Soon sealers\r\nand whalers of different nations began to frequent the prolific new\r\nregions. Then various European nations and the United States sent out\r\nexploring expeditions to the south polar regions to gather scientific\r\nand geographical information as well as to assist the charting of coasts\r\nand the determination of magnetic variations.\r\n\r\nOn account of their uninhabitability, their difficulty of access, and\r\ntheir unknown commercial value, the antarctic lands have claimed far\r\nless attention than the north polar regions. The famous explorer,\r\nCaptain James Cook of the royal navy, was commissioned by the British\r\nGovernment to undertake various exploring expeditions, and in carrying\r\nout his instructions he made several voyages to the antarctic. In 1773,\r\nwith his two vessels, _Resolution_ and _Adventure_, he crossed the\r\nantarctic circle--so far as is known, the first time that it had been\r\ncrossed by a human being. He continued farther southward, but finding an\r\nalarming increase of pack-ice and icebergs, he soon retreated north. In\r\nJanuary of the following year he succeeded after a third trial in\r\nreaching latitude 71° 10' south, the farthest south attained during the\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: An antarctic summer scene]\r\n\r\nIn 1839 an expedition was sent out by the United States Government under\r\nCaptain Charles Wilkes. The exploring squadron consisted of five ships\r\nand more than four hundred officers and men, scientists, and crews.\r\nWilkes was the first to discover the so-called mainland of the antarctic\r\ncontinent, in January, 1840. He then followed along this unknown\r\ncoast-line amid icebergs, fogs, and storms for over fifteen hundred\r\nmiles, taking such observations as were possible. For his polar\r\nachievements in discovery and exploration he was awarded a gold medal by\r\nthe Royal Geographical Society. Considering that he was supplied with\r\nimproperly equipped ships, he certainly accomplished wonders.\r\n\r\nThe British Government, realizing the necessity for better magnetic\r\ncharts of the south polar regions, and urged by the scientific societies\r\nof England, sent out a second expedition to the antarctic under the\r\ncommand of Sir James Ross. The expedition sailed from England in the\r\nfall of 1839 in the _Erebus_ and _Terror_, both of which were\r\nsubsequently lost in the unfortunate Franklin expedition.[2] On this\r\nvoyage Ross made many discoveries, the most important of which was\r\nVictoria Land. On this land is the south magnetic pole toward which the\r\nsouth-seeking end of the needle always points. Ross greatly desired to\r\nplant at the south magnetic pole the flag that had been displayed at the\r\nnorth magnetic pole in 1831, but he was unfortunately caught in the\r\npack-ice and compelled to abandon the attempt.\r\n\r\nTwo volcanic mountains were discovered on an island near Victoria Land.\r\nThese mountains Ross named Erebus and Terror from the two ships in which\r\nhe sailed. The former, thirteen thousand feet in height, was in violent\r\neruption, and the latter, ten thousand feet high, was quiescent.\r\n\r\nAn expedition which has accomplished very great results in antarctic\r\nresearch was sent out under Captain Robert F. Scott of the British navy\r\nin the vessel _Discovery_. Through the influence of the Royal\r\nGeographical Society this expedition was admirably financed, the English\r\nGovernment and private parties contributing four hundred and fifty\r\nthousand dollars toward its equipment.\r\n\r\nThe _Discovery_ left Cowes, England, in the summer of 1901, and, after\r\nmaking a series of magnetic observations south of Australia, steered for\r\nthe south polar regions. Pack-ice was met almost at the antarctic\r\ncircle, but Scott gradually worked the vessel through the pack and\r\nreached the base of Mount Terror where he landed a party. Then with the\r\nremainder of his men he coasted eastward along the great ice barrier for\r\nfive hundred miles. It was found that the barrier had receded thirty\r\nmiles since its front was examined by Ross in 1841 and that its front is\r\nwearing away at the rate of one-half mile a year. A captive balloon was\r\nused in making investigations of the ice front. If the unfortunate case\r\nof Andree be excepted, it was the first time that the balloon was used\r\nin polar research.\r\n\r\nThe vessel remained in a safe harbor near Mounts Terror and Erebus,\r\nwhere it lay frozen in for two winters. Every precaution was taken to\r\ninsure the safety of the land party in case the ice should break up and\r\nforce the ship out of the harbor. Suitable huts were erected on shore\r\nand a portion of the provisions was landed. Magnetic observations and\r\nother scientific work were carried on daily.\r\n\r\nDuring the warmer season of the year many journeys were made into the\r\ninterior. In order to be able to advance as far as possible, sledge\r\njourneys were made along a selected route to establish provision depots.\r\nThis being done, Captain Scott with two companions and nineteen sledge\r\ndogs started for a protracted journey into the interior. They travelled\r\nthree hundred and fifty miles inland over the great ice-field but did\r\nnot even then reach the end of it. Then, having lost most of the dogs,\r\nand the provisions being low, the party set out on their return to the\r\nship.\r\n\r\nThe few remaining dogs being disabled, the men were obliged to haul the\r\nsledges. Having suffered great hardships, the party reached the vessel\r\nafter an absence of three months.\r\n\r\nOn this journey a long range of mountains with many high peaks was\r\ndiscovered. The highest peak, fifteen thousand one hundred feet, was\r\nnamed Mount Markham. The latitude reached was 82° 17' south, being the\r\nfarthest distance south attained. On a subsequent journey a plateau of\r\nnine thousand feet elevation was reached, where the evenness of the ice\r\nsurface for miles seemed scarcely broken. The length of this journey was\r\nthree hundred miles.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the second winter two relief ships appeared at the edge of\r\nthe ice with orders that Captain Scott should return home at once. The\r\n_Discovery_ was still sealed up in the harbor with solid ice from twelve\r\nto seventeen feet thick, and it was a problem how to free the vessel.\r\nThe solid ice extended out more than six miles from the harbor.\r\n\r\nThe crews set resolutely to work making holes in the ice in a direct\r\nline from the imprisoned vessel to the open water. In these holes\r\npowerful explosives were placed which cracked the ice. This labor\r\nconsumed some nine days. Then the great ocean swells broke up the ice,\r\nfreeing the vessel. The _Discovery_ forthwith sailed for England by way\r\nof Cape Horn, arriving home in September, having gathered much valuable\r\ninformation during her sojourn in the south polar regions.\r\n\r\nAlthough practically no vegetable life has been found in these regions,\r\nan abundance of animal life exists in or contiguous to the sea,\r\ndependent on shrimps, fish, and such other life as the sea affords.\r\nSeals, penguins, petrels, cormorants, and gulls are found in\r\nconsiderable numbers. In fact, no persons tarrying in these regions need\r\nstarve for lack of food, such as it is.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The penguin defies the cold]\r\n\r\nDuring the two years spent by the _Discovery_ in the south polar ice,\r\nseals and penguins formed staple articles of the diet of the men. Though\r\nthe flesh of both of these creatures has a strong and peculiar flavor,\r\nit was found to be an agreeable change from pemican and other preserved\r\nmaterial. So vigorous were the men's appetites, stimulated by the\r\nexcessive cold, that when they labored hard sometimes seven meals were\r\nserved daily.\r\n\r\nBecause of the thick layer of fat covering their bodies, penguins were\r\nused as fuel when the coal began to give out. Penguins are strange,\r\ninteresting sea fowls having an inquisitive and fearless nature. At one\r\nof the rocky shore rookeries millions of these grotesque birds were\r\nseen.\r\n\r\nThe type of penguin found here is a very handsome bird, decked out in\r\nrather gay colors, having a jet black head, bluish-gray back and wings,\r\na yellow breast and bright spot of orange on the neck, and an\r\norange-colored lower bill. As though proud of his multicolored dress he\r\nwalks with slow and majestic step. His height is about four feet and his\r\naverage weight eighty-five pounds. He makes free use of his voice which\r\nis loud and shrill. Whenever a group of penguins see an object that\r\nexcites their curiosity they will stand around it in a circle and gaze\r\nat it intently. Lieutenant Shackleton had a graphophone as a part of his\r\nequipment, and whenever it was used, during the season when penguins\r\nwere about, they used to gather around the instrument by the hundreds,\r\nseeming to be quite as much interested as his human listeners.\r\n\r\nWhen all other birds flee at the approach of the antarctic winter the\r\neccentric penguin defies the cold and hatches its single egg in the dead\r\nof winter, with the thermometer ranging from eighteen to seventy degrees\r\nbelow zero. It does this by carrying the egg between its legs, resting\r\nit on the back of the foot while a fold of heavily feathered loose skin\r\ncompletely covers it up.\r\n\r\nAfter the chick is hatched it takes the place of the egg and is carried\r\naround in this queer receptacle. When the chick wants food it utters a\r\ncry. Thereupon the parent bends its neck down, and the little one\r\nthrusts its head into the parental mouth to help itself to regurgitated\r\nfood. The adult fowls of both sexes are fond of nursing the chickens and\r\nfrequently quarrel over the possession of the little ones, often with\r\nfatal results to the younglings. Over half of the chicks die or are\r\nkilled by kindness.\r\n\r\nThe expedition to the antarctic commanded by Lieutenant Ernest\r\nShackleton must always be considered one of the most important among\r\nthose fitted out for the work of polar research. Shackleton had been a\r\nmember of the Scott expedition and therefore was well acquainted with\r\nthe character of the work. The members of the staff, about twenty-five\r\nin number, were selected with great care, and the results of the\r\nexpedition demonstrated Lieutenant Shackleton's wisdom.\r\n\r\nThe _Nimrod_, a wooden steamship built for seal hunting, was purchased\r\nand equipped for the expedition. She was a small vessel, scarcely more\r\nthan one hundred feet in length. Her foremast carried square sails; her\r\nmain and mizzen masts were schooner-rigged. Under steam her speed did\r\nnot exceed six knots. The equipment included a generous outfit of\r\nscientific instruments, a supply of dogs and sledges, ten Manchurian or\r\n\"Shetland\" ponies, and a gasoline motor-car. The vessel was equipped at\r\nCowes, England, but made her final start from Lyttleton, New Zealand,\r\nNew Year's Day, 1908. In order to save her supply of coal for future use\r\nshe was towed to the antarctic circle.\r\n\r\nThe following winter months, May to September, were spent on Ross\r\nIsland, near the winter quarters of the _Discovery_, in McMurdo Bay,\r\nabout thirty degrees south of New Zealand. This bay, or sound, forms a\r\ncurve in the shore line of Victoria Land, the coast of which is the best\r\nknown part of the antarctic regions. Up to the present time it is the\r\nmost accessible entrance to south circumpolar regions known; it is also\r\nthe most convenient location for winter quarters, being only two\r\nthousand miles from New Zealand.\r\n\r\nIn the following March a party of six--David, Mawson, Mackay, Adams,\r\nMarshall, and Brocklehurst--prepared for the ascent of Mount Erebus, the\r\nvolcano, then active, discovered by Ross and named after one of his\r\nships. The crater rim was only a few miles distant, and during the\r\nfirst three days the party could be seen from the camp by means of a\r\npowerful telescope--tiny black specks struggling up the ice-clad slopes.\r\nThree craters were discovered, the youngest and highest of which was\r\nfound to be thirteen thousand three hundred and fifty feet above sea\r\nlevel.[3] During the ascent the party nearly perished in a gale which\r\nblew their tents into tatters. The crater rampart was finally reached,\r\nhowever, and a number of excellent photographs were made.\r\n\r\nDuring the entire stay at Ross Island the steam column from the crater\r\nfurnished the means whereby the direction of the upper currents of air\r\nmight be instantly noted, and the condition of activity did not differ\r\nmaterially from that observed in Stromboli. When the barometer was low\r\nthe steam column was heavier and denser; the glow of light was also\r\nbrighter. With a high barometer, on the contrary, the conditions were\r\nreversed, the steam column was insignificant and the glow was scarcely\r\nvisible. As a rule, the ascending column of steam was projected three\r\nthousand feet or more before it was caught by the upper air current.\r\nMeasurements showed the principal crater to be half a mile in diameter\r\nand nine hundred feet deep. Great deposits of sulphur and pumice were\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\nIn the last week of October a party composed of Shackleton, Adams,\r\nMarshall, and Wild started on the trip to discover the south pole. The\r\njourney to the point farthest south occupied seventy-three days. After a\r\nfew days out from the winter quarters no bare rock was seen--the\r\nlandscape being one of ice and snow.\r\n\r\nShackleton's journal of January 8 notes the fierce gales blowing at the\r\nrate of seventy or eighty miles an hour, while the temperature had\r\ndropped to \"seventy-two degrees of frost.\" \"We are short of fuel,\" he\r\nwrites, \"and at this high altitude, eleven thousand six hundred feet, it\r\nis hard to keep any warmth in our bodies between the scanty meals. We\r\nhave nothing to read now, having left behind our little books to save\r\nweight, and it is dreary work lying in the tent with nothing to read,\r\nand too cold to write much in the diary.\"\r\n\r\n\"It (January 9, 1909) is our last day outward. We have shot our bolt and\r\nthe tale of latitude is 88° 23' south. We hoisted her majesty's flag,\r\nand the other Union Jack afterward, and took possession of the plateau\r\nin the name of his majesty. While the Union Jack blew out stiffly in the\r\nicy gale that cut us to the bone we looked south with powerful glasses,\r\nbut could see nothing but the dead white snow-plain. There was no break\r\nin the plateau as it extended toward the pole, and we felt sure that the\r\ngoal we have failed to reach lies on this plain. We stayed only a few\r\nminutes, and then taking the queen's flag, and eating our scanty meal as\r\nwe went, hurried back and reached our camp about 3 P. M. Whatever\r\nregrets may be, we have done our best.\" On their return journey the\r\nparty killed the two surviving ponies for food.\r\n\r\nEarly in October, 1908, a party consisting of David, Mawson, and Mackay\r\nstarted on their journey to locate the south magnetic pole. Like the\r\njourney of the southern party, it was a trip of hardship, intense cold,\r\nand physical suffering. On January 16, 1909, partly by experiment and\r\npartly by calculation, the point of vertical position of the needle was\r\nfound in latitude 72° 25' south, longitude 155° 16' east. The position\r\nfound by Professor David was very close to that obtained by Scott of the\r\n_Discovery_ expedition and about forty miles from that which Ross\r\ncalculated in 1841. In the interval of nearly seventy years, it is safe\r\nto assume that the position of the south magnetic pole has shifted forty\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the knowledge obtained in other directions, Shackleton\r\nfrankly admits that the secret of the great ice barrier cannot be\r\nlearned until the structure and trend of the mountain ranges which seem\r\nto form its edge are traced. The investigations showed, however, that it\r\nis composed of densely packed snow. It was found that at least one part\r\nof the ice barrier is receding, and that Balloon Bight, noted by Captain\r\nScott, had disappeared in consequence of the recession. Not the least\r\nimportant part of the exploration was the discovery of forty-five miles\r\nof coast. Shackleton also was able to strengthen the opinion that\r\nEmerald, Nimrod, and Dougherty Islands do not exist.\r\n\r\nThe hardy Shetland and Manchurian ponies, first used by Evelyn Baldwin,\r\nproved a valuable equipment in polar research. Shackleton's gasoline\r\nmotor-car and Scott's captive balloon were of considerable but limited\r\nuse.\r\n\r\nDuring 1910 and 1911 three different nations--England, Norway, and\r\nJapan--were represented by expeditions in south polar regions. The\r\nNorwegian expedition under Captain Roald Amundsen was especially\r\nequipped for quick travel, having eight sledges and more than one\r\nhundred trained dogs.\r\n\r\nThe expedition made its way to the head of Ross Sea, a large bay of the\r\nAntarctic plateau, nearly due south of New Zealand. The camp there was\r\nmade the base of supplies. Depots for provisions were first established\r\nin latitudes 80°, 81°, and 82°.\r\n\r\nA start for the pole was made September 8 with eight men, seven sledges,\r\nand ninety dogs. The weather was too severe for the dogs, however, and\r\nthe party returned to camp. By the middle of October summer weather had\r\nset in, and on the 20th of the month five men, four sledges, and\r\nfifty-two dogs started on the poleward trip. Three days later they\r\nreached and passed the first depot; on the 31st the second depot was\r\nreached; and on November 5 the sledges reached the third depot in\r\nlatitude 82°. Additional supplies were thereafter cached, in depots\r\nabout one degree apart, to be used on the return trip. Snow cairns were\r\nbuilt at frequent intervals to mark the trail. The last cache of\r\nsupplies was left at latitude 85°.\r\n\r\nFrom this point the way was a steep and difficult climbing over the\r\nrange, or barrier, that had proved so difficult for Shackleton. Peaks in\r\nheight from ten thousand to fifteen thousand feet loomed up on every\r\nside, and glacier surfaces proved to be the easiest paths.\r\n\r\nWhen a height of nine thousand feet had been reached the rugged upraise\r\nopened out into a nearly level plateau. On December 10 observations\r\nshowed latitude 89°, and on the 14th of the month the party reached\r\nlatitude 90° and achieved the conquest of the South Pole. The Norwegian\r\nflag was planted, and after three days spent in checking observations\r\nthe party returned in safety. The expedition returned by way of\r\nTasmania. The vessel employed was the _Fram_, the small steamship used\r\nby Nansen.\r\n\r\nCaptain Scott, who commanded the _Discovery_ in the expedition of 1901,\r\nwent with the men in his command to Ross Sea and made his head-quarters\r\nnear the head of that body of water. He at once sent out exploring\r\nparties, one of which started for the pole. According to reports made in\r\nApril, 1912, he had accomplished a great deal of work in surveys and\r\ngeological research, probably more than all that of his predecessors.\r\n\r\nThe same reports brought also word that the Japanese expedition under\r\nLieutenant Shirase had surveyed a considerable extent of the Antarctic\r\ncoast.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: In April, 1831, Ross had the honor of fixing the location\r\nof the north magnetic pole on the Boothia Peninsula in latitude 70° 5'\r\nnorth and longitude 96° 46' west.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: According to the observations of Ross its altitude was\r\ntwelve thousand three hundred and sixty-seven feet. Inasmuch as a change\r\nin altitude results from each eruption, both determinations may be\r\ncorrect. The admiralty charts give twelve thousand nine hundred and\r\ntwenty-two feet, the determination of the expedition of 1901.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nICELAND, THE MAID OF THE NORTH\r\n\r\n\r\nSeveral thousand years ago a mighty conflict occurred between the sea\r\nand the subterranean forces in the north Atlantic five hundred miles\r\nnorthwest of Scotland. A violent earthquake rent the rocks of the ocean\r\nbed, and through the broken floor there issued tremendous floods of\r\nmolten lava. The great conflict manifested itself in explosions of\r\nsteam, gigantic streams of red-hot lava, frothy pumice, and volcanic\r\nashes. For miles around the water of the sea was seething and boiling.\r\n\r\nAfter awhile the turbulence of the fiery mass was subdued and it stood\r\ncongealed in the varied forms of rugged peaks, contorted ridges, and\r\ndeep valleys, subsequently to be seamed and further distorted by\r\nearthquakes and piled higher by further volcanic outbursts. A new island\r\nhad been born.\r\n\r\nAges rolled on; vegetation appeared as the volcanic rock disintegrated;\r\ncrystal lakes were formed and rivers, fed by frequent rains and melting\r\nsnows, flowed to the sea. This comparatively new island is Iceland. The\r\nbook of nature here is open; the print is clear; and the language is so\r\nplain that he who can read may learn the story.\r\n\r\nThe internal fires of the earth seem to have taken their final great\r\nstand in this far-off northern land and have waged a titanic battle to\r\nthe death, as may be seen in many places. In the northern part of the\r\nisland one may find acres of burning sulphur beds, small geysers, and\r\nmud caldrons, all of which attest to the slowly dying volcanic forces\r\nbeneath. Although a comparative calm now exists, an exciting cause may\r\nat any time awaken the slumbering volcanoes and again renew the work of\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\nFossilized forests are found, but of trees different from those now\r\nexisting. Climate and vegetation materially changed as century succeeded\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nThe written history of Iceland begins about the year 860, when a viking\r\nliving on the Faroe Islands who was on his way home from Norway, being\r\ndriven far northward of his course, came to an unknown coast. Climbing a\r\nhigh rock and looking around, he beheld no signs of life; before he\r\ncould return to his ship, however, a sudden storm came on, covering the\r\nground with a mantle of snow. From the latter circumstance he named the\r\ncountry Snowland.\r\n\r\nFour years after a Swedish master-mariner was driven by stress of storm\r\nto this same land, and, building a house, spent the winter there. During\r\nthe following summer he sailed around the land, demonstrating that it\r\nwas an island, and called it after his own name, Gardar's Island. On his\r\nreturn home he gave such a favorable account of the island that a famous\r\nNorwegian viking named Floki determined to seek it and to take\r\npossession. Having gathered his family and followers, and taking on\r\nboard some live stock, he set sail for the unknown land by way of the\r\nFaroe Islands.\r\n\r\nThe compass had not then been invented, but knowing that ravens by\r\ninstinct seek the nearest land when freed on the ocean, he provided\r\nhimself with three of these birds to serve as guides.\r\n\r\nHe remained awhile at the Faroe Islands and then boldly sailed\r\nnorthward. When he was several days out he uncaged one of the ravens,\r\nwhich immediately took its flight back to the Faroe Islands. Later, he\r\nset free a second bird. This one, after hovering high in the air for\r\nsome time, seemed bewildered and returned to the ship. Still later, the\r\nthird raven was set free, which at once flew northward. By pursuing the\r\ncourse taken by the last bird, Floki soon reached the desired land.\r\n\r\nThe winter that followed was very severe. Deep snows covered hill, rock,\r\nand valley, and ice blockaded the fiord. Floki had neglected to harvest\r\nthe wild grass, and as a result his cattle died. Disheartened by his\r\nlosses, he returned to his native land, naming the island which he\r\nabandoned Iceland.\r\n\r\nA few years later another Norse rover, who had slain an enemy and was\r\nthreatened with vengeance by the relatives of the victim, took refuge on\r\nthe island where he spent a year. He liked the country so well that he\r\nreturned home and induced his retainers to accompany him back to his\r\nsafe retreat. Approaching the land, he threw into the sea the sacred\r\ncolumns which his vessel bore, so that he might learn the will of the\r\ngods where to land and found a colony. A violent storm arising, the\r\npillars drifted out of sight, so he sought the nearest harbor and there\r\nhe established a temporary camp.\r\n\r\nThree years afterward the pillars were found on the desolate shore of a\r\nlava stream on the west side of the island. Near by was a rivulet from\r\nwhose bed a spring gushed forth emitting clouds of steam. Thither the\r\ncolony removed and the present capital, Reykjavik, was founded. The name\r\nReykjavik means \"smoking bay.\" Other vikings followed and selected such\r\nparts of the island as they considered best.\r\n\r\nHarold, the king of Norway at this time, determined to curb the\r\nrebellious spirit of the chiefs under him. So, many of the sturdy\r\nNorsemen, chafing under his arbitrary rule, collected such of their\r\nproperty as they could carry and, putting it on board their stanch\r\nvessels, sailed away to the land of refuge.\r\n\r\nAt this period of history nearly all nations considered that might made\r\nright; but no class of plunderers excelled the Norsemen, who were wont\r\nto make periodical raids on the various seaport cities and towns of\r\nEurope. They swooped upon them, pillaging and killing the inhabitants,\r\nand then fled in their swift vessels with booty and captives before they\r\ncould be intercepted. The audacity of the Norse vikings knew no bounds.\r\nThey pillaged Paris, Bordeaux, Orleans, and nearly every other city of\r\nFrance accessible by water. Their hands fell heavily on the coasts of\r\nSpain and the British Isles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Street in Reykjavik, Iceland]\r\n\r\nAt one time a band of these fearless sea-robbers made their lairs in the\r\nShetland and Orkney Islands and even plundered the coast of Norway, the\r\nabode of their kinsmen. Their conduct so exasperated Harold that he\r\ndetermined to destroy the freebooters of the Orkneys root and branch.\r\nGathering a large fleet, he relentlessly pursued the raiders up every\r\nbay and inlet. Leaving the ships, he chased them among the rocky islands\r\nand the sinuous fiords. When they were overtaken the pursuers showed\r\nthem no mercy. A few escaped, and, stealing away under the cover of\r\ndarkness, the hunted sea-robbers fled in their ships to Iceland.\r\n\r\nAll the while the tide of immigration was augmented by the migrations of\r\ndisaffected nobles from Norway. This naked volcanic island had more\r\nattraction for them than their own country where freedom was denied\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nSixty years after the first settlement fifty thousand people had made\r\ntheir homes in Iceland. The inhabited parts were along the coast, in the\r\nriver valleys, and in the vicinity of the fiords, rarely extending\r\nfarther than fifty miles inland.\r\n\r\nIn order to better maintain rights and settle disputes, in 930 the\r\nchiefs or nobles established an aristocratic republic and adopted a\r\nconstitution. The republic existed four hundred years. Many just laws\r\nwere enacted, some of which England was glad to borrow. The legislative\r\nmeetings were held in Thingvalla, a picturesque valley thirty-five miles\r\neast of Reykjavik. This valley was formed by the sinking of a lava area\r\nof fifty square miles. In the middle of the valley, flanked by two huge\r\njagged walls of lava, is a triangular floor of lava like a large\r\nflatiron having separating chasms meeting at the apex. Here the Althing,\r\nor general assembly, met annually to make laws and settle disputes.\r\nToward the south the valley slopes gently to Thingvalla Vatn, a\r\nbeautiful sheet of water of crystal clearness ten miles long and five\r\nmiles wide, having in some places a depth of a thousand feet. The\r\nscenery here is one of rugged beauty and surpassing grandeur. Hard by,\r\na river comes tumbling over its rocky bed, then calmly pours its icy\r\nwater into the placid lake. No spot is better suited to inspire freedom\r\nof thought and lofty imagination than this primitive meeting-place of a\r\nlegislative assembly.\r\n\r\nEventually, Iceland became subject to Norway and afterward a colony of\r\nDenmark, which it remains to-day. Self-government and the\r\nre-establishment of the old Parliament at Reykjavik was granted by\r\nDenmark in 1874.\r\n\r\nIceland is not only out of debt but has the snug sum of one million\r\ncrowns in its exchequer. It is an ideal place for the woman's rights\r\nadvocates, since women here have the right to vote and do not change\r\ntheir names when they marry.\r\n\r\nAlthough the island contains forty thousand square miles, five-sixths of\r\nit is uninhabitable. The present population is eight thousand.\r\n\r\nIt may with truth be called naked because it is only partly clothed with\r\nvegetation; moreover, such vegetation as exists is scanty and confined\r\nchiefly to the river valleys and their slopes. In the interior are large\r\ndesert areas covered with lava and shifting sand. This desolate expanse\r\nis frequently diversified by extensive jokulls, or elevated ice-fields,\r\none of which occupies four thousand square miles.\r\n\r\nStrange as it may seem, the winters in the inhabited sections are not so\r\nsevere as those of New England, owing to the modifying influence of the\r\nwarm southwesterly wind and the mild temperature of the surrounding\r\nwaters. The summers are cool, owing to the nearness of the arctic\r\nice-fields. In the interior on the table-land one is apt to encounter\r\nsnowstorms even in August.\r\n\r\nThe only wild animal is the fox, of which there are two varieties, the\r\nwhite and the blue. These animals probably drifted on the ice from\r\nGreenland. They are hunted not only for their skins but also because\r\nthey attack the sheep.\r\n\r\nThe domestic animals are horses, cattle, sheep, dogs, and cats. The\r\nhorses and cattle are small. The ewes, instead of the cows, are milked.\r\nIceland ponies are famous for their hardiness and are sure-footed. Large\r\nnumbers of them are exported to England for service in the coal-mines.\r\nThere they are condemned to hard labor for life in the dark galleries.\r\n\r\nIceland ranks second among the geyser regions of the world, Yellowstone\r\nPark being first. The boiling springs and geysers are not confined to\r\none locality but are scattered widely over the island. The most\r\nprominent are east of Reykjavik.\r\n\r\nAccording to its area probably no other part of the world except the\r\nisland of Java has so many volcanoes. More than one hundred craters and\r\ncinder cones have been counted, many of which have been active within\r\nthe historical period of the island. The most destructive volcanic\r\neruption took place in June, 1783. The spring had opened auspiciously;\r\nthe cattle, sheep, and horses were cropping the juicy young grass; and\r\nthe air was balmier than usual. In the latter part of May a bluish smoke\r\naccompanied by earthquakes began to spread over the land. As time passed\r\nthe earthquake shocks increased in violence. The surface of the earth\r\nheaved like the ground swell of the ocean after a storm; the atmosphere\r\nbecame filled with choking vapors and blinding smoke; the sun was\r\ndarkened and the low rumbling sounds became heavy peals of thunder.\r\nPresently two mighty streams of lava, one of which was fifteen miles\r\nwide and one hundred feet deep, came pouring down the sides of Skaptar\r\nJokull. The lava floods filled up the valleys, quenched rivers, and\r\nspread destruction over the adjacent country. The intense heat blasted\r\nthe vegetation far and wide. Nine thousand people and fifty thousand\r\nhead of live stock were the result of the death harvest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: North Cape, Iceland]\r\n\r\nIceland is well watered, having many streams, all of which are rapid,\r\nfor the greater part flowing over beds of lava and quicksand. In some of\r\nthe wider fords stakes have been set so that the traveller may not get\r\nlost in crossing them on horseback during a dense fog. In the summer the\r\nfrequent rains make travelling very unpleasant unless one is suitably\r\nequipped with water-proof garments. In the Hvita, or White River, is the\r\ncelebrated Gullfoss--literally, \"goldfall\"--a fall that rivals Niagara\r\nin the height of its two cataracts.\r\n\r\nA few garden vegetables excepted, little or no agriculture is\r\nattempted; the chief dependence of the people is the rearing of sheep,\r\ncattle, and horses, fishing, and the collecting of eider-down. The\r\nstreams are filled with excellent fish, including the salmon; off the\r\ncoast are codfishing grounds equal to, if not surpassing, those of\r\nNewfoundland.\r\n\r\nThe most valuable mineral is sulphur, the supply of which appears to be\r\ninexhaustible. The chief exports are wool, oil, fish, horses,\r\neider-down, knit goods, sulphur, and Iceland moss.\r\n\r\nTransparent calcite, a mineral commonly called \"Iceland spar,\" is found,\r\none mine of which furnishes an excellent quality. It is highly prized by\r\nmineralogists on account of its double refractive qualities. If a piece\r\nof this mineral be placed over a word, the letters forming it will\r\nappear double. Iceland spar is used chiefly in the optical instrument\r\nknown as the polariscope.\r\n\r\nEider-down consists of the soft, fine feathers growing on the breast of\r\nthe eider-duck, great numbers of which frequent the coast and lakes of\r\nIceland. This duck is wild except at the nesting season; then it is as\r\ntame as the domestic fowl and makes its nest not only around and on top\r\nof the buildings but frequently inside them. A heavy fine is imposed on\r\nany one killing a duck at this season.\r\n\r\nWhen about to lay, the duck carefully lines her nest with down plucked\r\nfrom her breast. Then people remove it from the nest and the duck pulls\r\nmore down from her breast to replace that taken. This process is\r\nrepeated several times. When the duck has stripped her own breast the\r\ndrake comes to the rescue and furnishes down from his. A certain number\r\nof the eggs are also taken. These, though inferior to those of the swan,\r\nare esteemed a great delicacy. Swans also are killed on many of the\r\nlakes.\r\n\r\nIceland is the resort of the fishing fleets of several nations; the\r\nvalue of the annual catch averages about ten million dollars. Much of\r\nthe catch consists of food fish, but many are caught for the oil.\r\n\r\nThe only trees found growing on the island are birch and ash, and they\r\nseldom exceed ten feet in height. A few juniper bushes and willows are\r\nfound here and there.\r\n\r\nIn the remote and isolated sections most of the dwellings are built of\r\nblocks of lava laid one upon another, making a wall six feet thick. Upon\r\nthese are placed rafters made from ribs of whales, drift-wood, or\r\nanything else that will answer the purpose. The roof is then covered\r\nwith grass and turf. In the hamlets many of the houses are constructed\r\nof imported lumber, there being no trees of sufficient size on the\r\nisland for building purposes.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants are very hospitable and every house is open to the\r\ntraveller. They live in a simple manner, drink sour whey and milk, eat\r\nrancid butter, fish, mutton, and occasionally the lichens called Iceland\r\nmoss. When well cooked, the last named is quite palatable. It is also a\r\nsovereign remedy for bronchial ailments.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding their many privations, the people are loyal to their\r\ncountry and lovingly call it \"The Maid of the North.\" They lead pastoral\r\nlives and their customs are much like those of the Homeric age.\r\nStory-telling is much appreciated by all classes. There are wandering\r\nminstrels who gain their livelihood by going from house to house to\r\nrecite the stories in prose and poetry which they have learned by heart.\r\nSpindle and distaff are used in spinning the wool into yarn, which is\r\nthen knit or woven into cloth on a hand loom.\r\n\r\nEducation is universal, and no child of twelve years can be found who is\r\nunable to read or write. The families are so isolated that there are few\r\nschools outside of the capital; but the parents diligently teach their\r\nchildren whatever they themselves have learned.\r\n\r\nDuring the long winter evenings one member of the family reads aloud\r\nwhile the others are busily at work, the men making nets and ropes, or\r\nremoving the wool from the sheepskins, the women embroidering, sewing,\r\nor using spindle and distaff.\r\n\r\nIn no other country of Europe are so many books and papers published in\r\nproportion to the population as in Iceland. On the average one hundred\r\nbooks are issued annually from Icelandic presses. Several excellent\r\nnewspapers and periodicals are also published.\r\n\r\nEvery Icelander to-day knows perfectly the sagas, the legendary stories\r\nthat commemorate heroes and heroic deeds and which are so dear to his\r\nheart. It is not uncommon to find an Icelander who is well versed in the\r\nancient classics or one who can speak several languages. They are well\r\nacquainted with the writings of Milton and Shakespeare, which have been\r\ntranslated into their own language. During the twelfth and thirteenth\r\ncenturies Iceland produced a literature equal to that of any other\r\nnation in Europe within the same period.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nGREENLAND\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of Greenland really begins about the year 986 A. D., when\r\nEric the Red, a chieftain who had been banished from Iceland, landed on\r\nthe island with some of his followers and made it his permanent\r\nresidence. At different times these hardy and daring seamen made\r\nexpeditions to the eastern coast of North America, and sailed as far\r\nsouth as Chesapeake Bay. They attempted to found a colony on the east\r\ncoast at a point thought to be on the coast of New Jersey but, after\r\ncontending with the savages for some time, deemed it best to abandon the\r\nproject and to return to their Greenland home. The location at which\r\nthey attempted their colony is by no means certain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Stone igloos on the bleak coast of Greenland]\r\n\r\nAll this island, a half million square miles in area, except a small\r\npart of the southern coast line and a larger area in the north, is\r\ncovered by an immense glacier. And this field of ice, like a huge piece\r\nof plastic wax, is constantly moving from the interior down toward the\r\nsea. As it approaches the ocean it divides into branches which flow down\r\nthe numerous fiords and valleys into the sea. As the fronts of the\r\nbranch glaciers are pushed out into the water their ends are broken off\r\nby the buoyancy of the water. These glacial-born masses then float away\r\nas icebergs, carrying with them on their southward journeys the rock\r\nwaste--moraine detritus it is called--gathered by the parent glaciers.\r\n\r\nWhen these floating leviathans are off the coast of Newfoundland, they\r\nencounter the waters of the Gulf Stream, melt, and scatter their débris\r\nof stony matter over a large area of the ocean bed. This process, having\r\ngone on for thousands of years, has shoaled the ocean in certain parts,\r\nforming the so-called Banks of Newfoundland.\r\n\r\nA gelatinous slime filled with minute animal life forms on the bottom of\r\nthe ocean in the arctic; the cold currents flowing south carry some of\r\nit along with them, and much of it is lodged on the stony bottoms of\r\nthese banks. Fish, especially the cod, are fond of this gelatinous\r\nsubstance, and throng thither at certain seasons of the year in\r\ncountless numbers to feed upon it.\r\n\r\nOne ignorant of the currents of the ocean might be puzzled at times in\r\nobserving that an iceberg floats southward at the same time that pieces\r\nof wood are floating northward, both apparently acted upon by the same\r\ncurrent. This may be explained by recalling that warm water is lighter\r\nthan cold and hence is found as the upper layer when a cold and a warm\r\ncurrent are flowing in different directions, one upon the other. It\r\nshould be borne in mind that seven-eighths of the floating iceberg is\r\nunder water, leaving but one-eighth above the surface. The Gulf Stream\r\ndrift spreads out as it travels northward, and, being much shallower\r\nthan the arctic currents, carries floating objects northward on the\r\nsurface, while the deeper and more powerful arctic currents force the\r\nhuge masses of ice southward.\r\n\r\nWhen the warm air over the Gulf Stream comes in contact with the\r\nfloating ice it is chilled, and the moisture which it holds is condensed\r\ninto fog. The fogs in turn, which are off the Newfoundland coast, being\r\nin the line of steamship communication between Europe and America, are a\r\nconstant menace to navigation. The near presence of ice is usually\r\ndetected by a greater chilliness in the air. In order to avoid\r\ncollisions with one another, and also with icebergs, a ship constantly\r\nsounds its sirens and fog horns as warnings while in the fog belt. The\r\nsignal of another steamship is a warning of the one; the answering echo\r\nannounces the nearness of the other.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A large iceberg]\r\n\r\nThe high interior of Greenland, about ten thousand feet in altitude, is\r\nthought to result largely from the accumulation of ages of snow and ice,\r\nonly a part of which melts or moves oceanward to form glaciers. No other\r\npart of the world is such an absolute desert as the greater part of this\r\nisland. Animal and vegetable life are wholly absent.\r\n\r\nThe colony which was planted in Greenland by Eric the Red, and\r\nsubsequently augmented by other Norsemen, continued to prosper for four\r\nhundred years. At the end of that period there were about two hundred\r\nvillages, twelve parishes, and two monasteries. These, however,\r\ndisappeared. The hostility of the Eskimos in part accounts for their\r\nextinction, but an encroachment of ice from the north, which encompassed\r\nthe southern part of the island, is thought to have been also a factor.\r\nThe fact that foreign trade with Greenland was forbidden by the mother\r\ncountry may account in part for the gradual disappearance of the colony.\r\nAt all events, intercourse with Europe seems to have been cut off. This\r\ncondition continued for upward of two centuries, and when intercourse\r\nwith the mother country was again possible there was no Greenland\r\ncolony. Perhaps the finding of \"white\" Eskimo in Victoria Land may\r\nexplain this disappearance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A group of Eskimos in south Greenland]\r\n\r\nSubsequently the island was again colonized, but concerning the\r\ndisappearance of the former inhabitants history is silent. The mute\r\ntestimony of a few ruined buildings and relics is all that has been\r\nfound to give the least shadow of information as to the final struggle\r\nof the wretched colonists. We only know that they mysteriously\r\ndisappeared. But the great glacial cap is slowly receding and ages hence\r\nmore ground will be laid bare.\r\n\r\nThe present inhabitants number about ten thousand, most of whom are\r\nEskimos. They are lacking in thrift and live chiefly by hunting and\r\nfishing. Among the wild animals living here are the arctic fox, the\r\narctic hare, the musk ox, the seal, the polar bear, the ermine, and the\r\nwalrus.\r\n\r\nThe principal resources of the island are sealskins, eider-down, oil, and\r\ncryolite.\r\n\r\nCryolite is a mineral from which common soda is easily extracted, and\r\nalso from which the light silver-like aluminum was formerly prepared.\r\nThe mines near the village of Ivigtut furnish practically the world's\r\nsupply of this mineral. Formerly it was carried to Philadelphia, but in\r\nrecent years not much is used. The fisheries are a monopoly of Denmark,\r\nand each station is visited from one to three or four times a year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nWHERE THE TWO GREAT OCEANS MEET\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps there is no section of the globe about which most well-informed\r\npersons know so little as the southern part of South America. Judged by\r\nthe reports of early discoverers and explorers, this region until\r\nrecently has been considered a desolate stretch of snow mountains,\r\nbarren plains, and extensive morasses, sparsely inhabited by a few\r\nthousand human beings of the lowest type and worthless to civilized man.\r\n\r\nSuch a picture is but partly true. Many of the highest mountains are\r\nsnow-capped throughout the year and are scored by immense glaciers which\r\nare constantly moving down their grooved sides; but there are also\r\nheavily forested slopes flanked by valleys and plains covered with rich\r\ngrasses, making most excellent pasturage. The best land, comprising a\r\nlarge area, is now occupied as grazing grounds principally by sheep\r\nfarmers.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of the sixteenth century it was rumored that a water\r\npassage traversed the southern part of South America. This rumor was\r\nproved true in 1520, when Ferdinand Magellan, a Portuguese navigator in\r\nthe service of Charles V of Spain, sailed through the strait which now\r\nbears his name. He called the passage Todos los Santos--literally, \"All\r\nSaints\"--but later the name was changed to commemorate the bold captain\r\nwho discovered the route.\r\n\r\nMagellan was the first not only to sail through the strait, but to cross\r\nthe broad Pacific Ocean, which was so named by him on account of the\r\nquietness of its waters. Because he saw the fires built by the natives\r\nblazing on the islands along the south side of the channel, he called\r\nthem Tierra del Fuego, meaning \"Land of Fire.\"\r\n\r\nThe Strait of Magellan varies from three to seventy miles in width. The\r\nscenery along its shores, low and treeless in the eastern part,\r\nelsewhere is mountainous and heavily wooded--mainly with beech. In\r\nvarious places lofty precipices rise abruptly from the water's edge;\r\nthroughout most of its extent the shore line is rock-bound and studded\r\nwith islets.\r\n\r\nA more picturesque route, and one abounding in the grandest and most\r\nstupendous scenery in the world, is that from the Pacific by way of\r\nSmyth Channel, the entrance to which is four hundred miles north of the\r\nentrance to Magellan Strait. By this route one follows a series of\r\nchannels and reaches the strait proper near Desolation Island. On\r\naccount of the dangers besetting this course, underwriters refuse to\r\ninsure vessels taking it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Copyright, Underwood & Underwood, New York The Straits of\r\nMagellan. Cape Pilar is the extreme western end]\r\n\r\nIt remained for a Hollander named Schouten to discover Cape Horn, in\r\n1616, and thus find a safer way for sailing vessels going from the one\r\ngreat ocean to the other. Schouten named the cape \"Hoorn,\" from his\r\nnative city in Holland. Afterward the name was shortened to Horn, which\r\nis applied both to the cape and to the island from which it projects.\r\nSince the western entrance to the strait is subject to rough,\r\ntempestuous weather and strong currents, very few modern sailing vessels\r\ntake the shorter course, preferring to double the cape. Though doubling\r\nthe cape is the safer route, yet this passage itself is beset by\r\ndangerous storms and tempestuous seas. Fortunate is the sailing master\r\nwho rounds the Horn with pleasant weather.\r\n\r\nSome of the smaller islands of the archipelago are densely wooded and\r\npractically unexplored. Gold has been found on the beaches of several of\r\nthe islands in paying quantities, and these placers have been worked\r\nsuccessfully for several years. On the islands are found wild\r\nstrawberries of great size and fine flavor, wild raspberries,\r\ngooseberries, grapes, and celery; in the spring the pastures are covered\r\nwith a variety of wild flowers. A profusion of ferns is seen almost\r\neverywhere. Wild geese and swans are found on the lagoons and lakes in\r\nlarge numbers.\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time Patagonia, as the southern part of the continent is\r\npopularly called, was regarded as a waste; now it is recognized as a\r\nwonderfully fertile region, and is being rapidly settled. European\r\ncolonies have been established there, and they are highly prosperous.\r\nThe native Indians are disappearing, hurried to extinction chiefly by\r\nKing Alcohol, which, once tasted, seems to conquer them. Traders know\r\nthe weakness of these savages, and exploit it for all they are worth.\r\nThe articles which the Indians chiefly barter are skins, pelts, and\r\nostrich feathers.\r\n\r\nThe Indians are well supplied with horses, the descendants of those\r\nbrought to South America by Spanish explorers. They are wonderful riders\r\nand excel in the use of a peculiar lasso called the bolas. It consists\r\nusually of three balls of stone or metal covered with rawhide and\r\nattached to one another by twisted thongs of the same material. In\r\nfighting as well as in capturing wild animals, this instrument is\r\nindispensable. The operator, holding one of the balls, swings the others\r\nover his head and when sufficient momentum has been obtained lets them\r\ngo. If well aimed, the connected balls circle around the legs of the\r\nanimal to be caught, entangling and throwing it down.\r\n\r\nThe Indians of the mainland are strong and tall. Unlike most South\r\nAmerican Indians, they go about well clothed. Occasionally they kill\r\ntheir horses for food, but their chief reliance for both food and\r\nclothing is the guanaco.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Indians have inhabited this part of South America for\r\ncenturies, they follow well-beaten trails. They live in a superstitious\r\ndread of evil spirits, who they believe dwell in the densely wooded\r\nmountain slopes of the Cordillera.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fuegians]\r\n\r\nThe Indians of Tierra del Fuego archipelago are much inferior to those\r\nof the mainland. They go almost or entirely naked and subsist on fish.\r\nThe canoe Indians, as those in the western part are called, build boats\r\nof bark sewn together with sinews. The boats are about fifteen feet\r\nlong, and in the centre a quantity of earth is carried, upon which a\r\nfire is built. The canoe Indians have neither chief nor tribal\r\nrelations; each family is a law unto itself. They spend most of their\r\ntime during the day in rowing among the different channels where fish\r\nmay be obtained. At night they generally go on shore to sleep. A hole\r\nscooped out of the ground or a sheltered rock with a few boughs bent\r\ndown suffices for a house where all can huddle close together for\r\nwarmth. Seldom do they sleep more than one night in a place, fearing\r\nthat if they do not move on an evil spirit will catch them.\r\n\r\nIn the eastern part of Tierra del Fuego and on some of the other larger\r\nislands two tribes of Indians are found whose subsistence consists of\r\nsea food, guanacos, and such sheep as they can steal. These tribes are\r\ncontinually at enmity with the white settlers and will kill them\r\nwhenever possible.\r\n\r\nIn spite of cloudy weather and cold winds, which are common a part of\r\nthe year, the climate of Patagonia is milder than that of places much\r\nfarther north, and the sheep require no feeding during the winter\r\nseason. In the matter of sheep farms this section rivals Australia,\r\nsince there is no fear of drought. The grass continues green the year\r\naround, and the sheep easily fatten upon it.\r\n\r\nThe drawbacks to successful sheep-growing are many and the business\r\nrequires constant vigilance. Vultures, foxes, wild dogs, pumas, and\r\nIndians make serious inroads on the flocks. The wild dogs live in the\r\nsurrounding forests and from time to time rush out in packs of from ten\r\nto thirty and attack the sheep. Notwithstanding all these troubles,\r\nhowever, the profits of sheep-growing are large.\r\n\r\nRussians, Germans, French, Australians, English, and Scotch, many of\r\nwhom have amassed large fortunes in a few years, are engaged in this\r\nlucrative business. As in all other sheep-raising countries, the collie\r\nis an invaluable aid to the shepherds. Not only are the principal\r\nislands chiefly devoted to sheep-raising, but a considerable part of the\r\nsouthern mainland is also devoted to this industry. On the island of\r\nTierra del Fuego alone there are upward of a million sheep.\r\n\r\nMost of the land is leased from the government for a long term of years.\r\nMany of the proprietors have enclosed their holdings with wire fences,\r\nthereby lessening the expense of caring for their flocks. Some of the\r\nholdings range from twenty-five thousand to more than two million acres.\r\n\r\nSouthern Patagonia has immense numbers of guanacos, or wild llamas.\r\nThese animals frequent the Andean slopes and the adjacent pampas. During\r\nthe winter season they come down to the lowlands to drink in the\r\nunfrozen lakes and feed upon the herbage. During severe winters\r\nsometimes hundreds are found dead from starvation in the valleys near\r\nthe frozen lakes.\r\n\r\nThousands of wild cattle are found on the eastern slopes of the Andes,\r\nbut they are difficult to capture; they are exceedingly wary and can\r\nscent a man far off. In agility in climbing the steep, rough places they\r\nequal the goat. If one of their number is killed the whole herd deserts\r\nthe locality at night. When wounded they are fierce fighters, if forced\r\ninto close quarters.\r\n\r\nPunta Arenas, or \"Sandy Point,\" is on the north side of the Strait of\r\nMagellan and is Chilean territory. It is a new town cut out of the\r\nwoods, and even yet many of the streets are diversified by the stumps of\r\nbig beech trees. The place is an important coaling and provision station\r\nand, next to Honolulu, the most important ocean post-office in the\r\nworld. It has a population of twelve thousand, and is the capital and\r\ncentre of the great wool industry of the Territory of Magellan, which\r\ncomprises a majority of the islands south of the mainland, together with\r\nthe southern part of Patagonia.\r\n\r\nA few years ago, in order to encourage the building up of Punta Arenas,\r\nthe government offered a lot free to any one who would erect a building\r\non it. Many accepted the offer, and to-day some of the lots in the\r\nbusiness part of the town are very valuable. Although most of the\r\nbuildings are constructed with regard to economy rather than beauty, yet\r\nsome of the business blocks will compare favorably with those of the new\r\ncities in the United States.\r\n\r\nLike several Australian cities, Punta Arenas was a convict colony. It\r\nwas founded as such in 1843, and so remained until the European\r\nsteamships began to thread the strait instead of doubling the Horn. Then\r\nit became a coaling station, a supply store, a half-way town, and an\r\nocean post-office. All this business was previously carried on at the\r\nFalkland Islands, but the route through the strait settled the business\r\nfor both places. The Falkland station was abandoned; Punta Arenas became\r\na thriving town. A ticket-of-leave was given to each convict who\r\nconsented to join the Chilean army.\r\n\r\nThe town forthwith blossomed into a typical frontier settlement--banks\r\nand gambling dens, churches and saloons, schools and bullfights. Every\r\nrace of people and almost every industry is represented there. The\r\nSpanish see to it that the Sunday bullfights are correct; the French\r\ninsure the proper social functions; the Germans manage the banks; and\r\nthe Americans take the profits of the railways, telegraph lines, and\r\nflour-mills. As to latitude, Punta Arenas is cold and inhospitable; but\r\nfor business and social affairs, it is very, very warm, especially in\r\nthe matter of social affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nRECLAIMABLE SWAMP REGIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nIf only Dame Nature had distributed the rainfall of the United States a\r\nbit more evenly, land enough to feed about fifty millions of people\r\nwould not have required an expenditure of half a century of time and\r\nseveral hundred millions of good, hard dollars. One must bear in mind,\r\nhowever, that if Dame Nature had done otherwise, it is just as likely\r\nthat the same time and the same amount of money would have been required\r\nelsewhere for those same fifty millions of people.\r\n\r\nThe reclaimable swamp lands of the United States east of the Rocky\r\nMountains aggregate about one hundred and twenty thousand square miles\r\nin extent--an area nearly equal to that of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois\r\ncombined. Of this, Louisiana has about fifteen thousand square miles, a\r\ntract about as large as Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut\r\ncombined, and Florida has about half her entire area in swamp land. West\r\nof the Rocky Mountains, California takes the lead, with enough swamp\r\nland to make a state of respectable size.\r\n\r\nIn the case of California, if the \"forty-niners\" could have waited about\r\na thousand years they would have found the precious swamp lands all\r\nproperly filled in for them and ready for use; for the Sacramento and\r\nSan Joaquin Rivers long since have been working at the task of filling\r\nup the big hollow between the mountain ranges. But the rivers are a\r\ntrifle slow, and Californians are always in a steaming hurry. So Uncle\r\nSam's engineers are driving their reclamation schemes with railroad\r\nspeed. A few years ago these lands were worth nothing; drain them and\r\nthey are worth one hundred dollars per acre; improve them according to\r\nmodern farming science and they are worth ten times as much.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Everglades of Florida]\r\n\r\nIn many instances even the quick methods of the reclamation authorities\r\nare too slow for the California farmer, and so he takes matters into his\r\nown hands. First he acquires his land; then he mortgages all his worldly\r\npossessions to surround the land with a ditch deep enough and wide\r\nenough to make a dike high enough to keep out flood waters. His land\r\nafter draining is full of the stuff for which he otherwise would pay\r\nthousands and thousands of dollars. Phosphates and lime form the\r\ncoverings of minute swamp life and nitrogen compounds are a part of\r\ntheir bodies. The polders of Holland are not richer than this swamp\r\nland; indeed, they are not so rich. One or two crops will pretty nearly\r\nextinguish the mortgage and three or four more will put the owner on\r\n\"Easy Street.\"\r\n\r\nIn the bottom-lands of the Sacramento River is an island that for fifty\r\nyears went a-begging. Then a company with a shrewd head bought it, diked\r\nit, and drained it. Now the island has immense celery beds and the\r\nlargest asparagus farm in the world. The celery and canned asparagus are\r\nshipped to the produce markets of New York City.\r\n\r\nAnother great swamp area covers a large part of Louisiana, Mississippi,\r\nand Arkansas. This swamp was made when the head of the Gulf of Mexico\r\nreached half-way up to St. Louis, for the delta of the Mississippi River\r\nhas been travelling leisurely southward for several thousand years--so\r\nleisurely, in fact, that Iberville and Bienville opened the region to\r\nsettlement fifteen hundred years or more too soon. But Uncle Sam is\r\ntaking a hand here likewise, and in another fifty years a population\r\nhalf as large as that of New York may not only live comfortably but get\r\nrich on the reclaimed lands of this and adjacent coast swamps.\r\n\r\nThe Carolinas, Georgia, and Virginia all have large areas of coast\r\nmarshes--\"pocosons\" they call them--only a small part of which has been\r\nreclaimed. Formerly these were the property of the general government;\r\nthen they were given to the States with the understanding that they were\r\nto be reclaimed. Large tracts were sold to speculators for a few cents\r\nan acre, and there you are! Few States are rich enough to handle\r\nextensive reclamation enterprises, and so the general government stepped\r\nin again and assumed the responsibility. That means that the work of\r\nreclamation will be skilfully and honestly done. Uncle Sam may play some\r\nquestionable politics, but he never mixes politics and government\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nOf all the swamp lands of the United States, the region in Florida\r\nknown as the Everglades is the most interesting and the most romantic.\r\n\r\nPonce de Leon, an aged Spanish governor of Porto Rico, who was seeking\r\nthe Fountain of Perpetual Youth, discovered--not the long-sought\r\nfountain, but a peninsula decked with such a profusion of flowers that\r\nhe named the country Florida.\r\n\r\nFrom that time until years after it was ceded to the United States\r\nFlorida was repeatedly baptized in blood. From the first there were\r\nencounters between the Spanish and Indians in which no quarter was given\r\non either side. Later, an exterminating warfare broke out between the\r\nFrench and Spanish when a Huguenot colony was massacred and not a man,\r\nwoman, or child spared. In 1586 St. Augustine was burned by Sir Francis\r\nDrake, and a century later it was plundered by English buccaneers. Still\r\nlater, frequent contests were waged between the English colonies and the\r\nSpanish in Florida.\r\n\r\nPrevious to the acquisition of Florida by the United States hostile\r\nIndians, together with fugitive whites and renegade negroes who had\r\njoined them, made many raids upon the settlements in Georgia, robbing\r\nand burning plantations, murdering the whites, and carrying off the\r\nslaves. Retaliation to a certain extent was meted out to the\r\nblood-thirsty savages until Spain was glad to cede the peninsula to the\r\nUnited States in 1819 for five million dollars. Thereby she ridded\r\nherself of her troublesome protégés. The Indian raids still continued\r\nafter the acquisition, and the United States Government therefore sent\r\ntroops into Florida to punish the treacherous savages, who gradually\r\nretreated southward until they reached the Everglades. There they made\r\ntheir final stand.\r\n\r\nIn these almost inaccessible sinuous water passages and the dense island\r\nvegetation for a long time the Indians baffled our ablest military\r\nofficers. A seven years' contest followed which cost the United States\r\nfifteen hundred men and nearly twenty million dollars.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Group of Seminole Indians in the Everglades of Florida]\r\n\r\nAfter much negotiation and no end of trouble the Indians--they were the\r\nSeminoles--ceded their lands to the United States on the promise of an\r\nannuity of twenty-five thousand dollars and suitable lands in the Indian\r\nTerritory. About four thousand of the Seminoles were then removed to\r\ntheir new homes; a small remnant refusing to emigrate were left behind.\r\n\r\nThe name Everglades is applied to a vast swamp containing a multitude of\r\nshallow lakes studded with numerous islands. The region embraces most\r\nof the southern part of Florida. The water of the lakes, of which Lake\r\nOkechobee is the largest, varies in depth from a few inches to ten feet.\r\nThe region itself has an area six times that of the State of Rhode\r\nIsland, and on account of the difficulty in traversing it is but\r\nimperfectly known. Countless winding intricate water channels extend in\r\nevery direction. Many of these are filled with tall sawgrass which,\r\ngrowing from the bottom, greatly impedes the passage even of small\r\nboats. The average elevation of the Everglades above sea level is\r\nscarcely twenty feet. The water is both clear and wholesome, but the\r\nsurface is so nearly a dead level that the current is imperceptible; it\r\ncan be distinguished only by noting the position of the grass.\r\n\r\nThe islands are covered with a dense growth of oak, pine, cypress, and\r\npalmetto trees, together with a jungle of luxuriant tropical vines and\r\nshrubs. They range in size from one to one hundred acres and are but\r\nslightly elevated above the surrounding waters.\r\n\r\nAbout three hundred Seminole Indians inhabit the interior and live by\r\nhunting and fishing. Deer, bears, otters, panthers, wild cats, and\r\nsnakes frequent the land; alligators, crocodiles, fish of various kinds,\r\nand waterfowl dwell in the water. In the western part of the Everglades\r\nis Big Cypress Swamp and in the extreme southern part Mangrove Swamp,\r\nwhere myriads of mosquitoes are hatched out. Extending along the eastern\r\nside of the Everglades is a long, narrow belt of dry, fertile land which\r\nis utilized for farming purposes.\r\n\r\nA far-reaching project to reclaim the Everglades has been proposed.\r\nUnlike the Western projects, the problem is to get rid of water and not\r\nto supply it. The plans for reclamation include the construction of\r\ndrainage canals and the clearing of the jungle growths. It is purposed\r\nto use the land thus reclaimed for sugar growing. At the present time\r\nthe United States is importing annually over two hundred million\r\ndollars' worth of sugar; it is estimated that by draining only a part of\r\nthis vast area and planting it to sugar cane the local demands could not\r\nonly be supplied but a large surplus for export would result.\r\n\r\nThe possibilities of this region, when properly drained and cleared of\r\nits superfluous vegetation, are almost beyond computation. It has a rich\r\nsoil, abundant moisture, and almost tropical climate. Reclaimed land of\r\nthis character is suitable for raising not only sugar cane and\r\nsubtropical fruits, but a great variety of other crops. It is estimated\r\nthat the cost of reclaiming the Everglades, so that the land may be made\r\nproductive, need not exceed one dollar per acre.\r\n\r\nA great impetus has been given to southern Florida by that wonderful\r\nachievement of engineering, Mr. Henry Flagler's Florida East Coast\r\nRailway. This railway stretches in a direct line along the coast from\r\nJacksonville to the southern part of the State, and has been extended\r\nalong the Florida Keys to Key West. When all arrangements are completed,\r\nthe trains will be ferried across Florida Strait between Havana and Key\r\nWest, and freight will be sent from points in Cuba to New York and\r\nChicago without reloading.\r\n\r\nThe building of the Florida East Coast Railway is one of the great\r\nengineering feats of the world. In its construction from key to key\r\nthousands of tons of rock and cement were dumped into the water on which\r\nmassive viaducts in fifty-foot spans have been built to carry the\r\nroad-bed. These solid archways, rising from twenty to thirty feet above\r\nthe water, defy tides and storm waves. This railway has become one of\r\nthe chief factors in developing the resources of southern Florida and\r\nhastening the reclamation of the Everglades.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nSTRANGE ROCK FORMATIONS--NATURAL BRIDGES\r\n\r\n\r\nAlmost any unusual form in nature is apt to attract the eye and interest\r\nthe beholder; and when such natural objects resemble artificial ones or\r\nbear a fanciful resemblance to animals the similarity intensifies the\r\ninterest and almost always leads one to apply fanciful names to them. In\r\nwandering along a rocky shore one instinctively searches for the curious\r\nformations carved out by the unceasing action of the waves; and in\r\njourneying through rugged sections of mountain country each unusual rock\r\nformation rivets the attention at once.\r\n\r\nCaves especially have a peculiar attraction of awe and curiosity\r\ncombined. Such natural objects as Mammoth Cave in Kentucky, Luray Cave\r\nin Virginia, Calaveras Cave in California, the Garden of the Gods in\r\nColorado, the Giant's Causeway on the north coast of Ireland, and\r\nFingal's Cave on the island of Staffa are visited annually by many\r\nthousands of people. And no wonder that all mankind, from the savage to\r\nthe most civilized, is charmed with natural arches spanning great\r\nchasms. No cyclopædia of natural wonders fails to give at least a brief\r\ndescription of the Natural Bridge of Virginia which spans a small stream\r\nthat flows into the James River. So great a wonder was the structure\r\nregarded to be even in colonial times that it then claimed marked\r\nattention. Thomas Jefferson became so much interested in this natural\r\nwonder that he applied to George III for a reservation of land that\r\nshould include the bridge, and in 1774 his request was granted. To\r\naccommodate distinguished strangers who might visit the bridge,\r\nJefferson built near by a log cabin of two rooms. Concerning it he said:\r\n\"The bridge will draw the attention of the world.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Devil's Slide, Weber Canyon, Utah]\r\n\r\nChief-Justice Marshall described it as \"God's greatest miracle in\r\nstone.\" And Henry Clay said it was \"the bridge not made with hands, that\r\nspans a river, carries a highway, and makes two mountains one.\" On the\r\nrocky abutments are found carved the names of many persons. Among them\r\nis that of Washington. In his youth, laboriously cutting places for his\r\nhands and feet, he climbed up the face of one of the steep abutments and\r\ncut his name above all others, where for seventy years it stood\r\nunsurpassed in height. In 1818 a daring college student climbed from the\r\nfoot to the top of the rock, thus outranking all others.\r\n\r\nThe Natural Bridge is composed of blue limestone; it is two hundred and\r\nfifteen feet high, ninety feet wide, and spans a chasm eighty-five feet\r\nacross. A public highway lined with trees passes over the top. The\r\nbridge itself is all that remains of the roof of what once was a\r\nlimestone cavern.\r\n\r\nThe southeastern part of Utah is overlaid with strata of red and yellow\r\nsandstone hundreds of feet deep. Ages ago this whole region was elevated\r\nand thereby was distorted by the internal forces which pushed it upward.\r\nSubsequently wonderful transformations were wrought. The flowing streams\r\ngradually bored through portions of the soft, uplifted sandstone,\r\nforming arches and digging deep canyons, while the air and rain rounded\r\noff the rugged parts into graceful shapes.\r\n\r\nWonderful as is the famous Natural Bridge of Virginia, the natural\r\nbridges of Utah are still more wonderful. In White Canyon of\r\nsoutheastern Utah are Edwin, Carolyn, and Augusta Bridges--magnificent\r\nstructures of pink sandstone carved in lines of classic symmetry and\r\npossessing gigantic proportions. At least half a dozen natural bridges\r\nin Utah surpass that of Virginia, not only in beauty and grandeur, but\r\nalso in dimensions. They were discovered by cattlemen in 1895, but they\r\ndid not become known to the outside world until 1909, when the region\r\nwas explored by the Utah Archæological Expedition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Witch Rocks, near Echo Canyon, Utah]\r\n\r\nOf these bridges the Edwin easily ranks first in graceful symmetry; its\r\nspan is one hundred and ninety-four feet, its elevation one hundred and\r\neight feet, its width thirty-five feet. Combining grace and massiveness,\r\nthe Augusta stands pre-eminent. It rises in majestic proportions to the\r\nheight of two hundred and twenty-two feet and has a span between\r\nabutments of two hundred and sixteen feet. The width of the road-bed is\r\ntwenty-eight feet and the thickness of the arch at the keystone is\r\nforty-five feet. The height of the Carolyn Bridge is two hundred and\r\nfive feet and the span one hundred and eighty-six feet.\r\n\r\nAll these bridges span canyons whose depths correspond to the height of\r\nthe arched structures. In White Canyon, a few miles below Edwin Bridge,\r\nunder its overhanging rock walls, are the ruins of numerous\r\ncliff-dwellings.\r\n\r\nThe largest natural bridge in the world yet discovered is the\r\nNonnezoshi. It is in Nonnezoshiboko Canyon, Utah, not far from the place\r\nwhere the San Juan River enters the Colorado. This mammoth arch is more\r\nof a flying buttress spanning the canyon than a real bridge. Its height\r\nis three hundred and eight feet and its span two hundred and eighty-five\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nTo visit these bridges from the nearest railway station requires stage\r\nand horseback riding for upward of one hundred and twenty-five miles.\r\nThe latter part of the journey is made over a faint trail through a\r\nrugged country; but the scenery amply repays one for the hardships\r\nendured.\r\n\r\nThe climatic changes during the ages have been such that this region is\r\nnow almost inaccessible on account of the lack of water, except in the\r\nearly spring when melting snows yield a temporary supply. Even the\r\ncattlemen pasturing their herds in that section keep them there but a\r\nfew weeks during the year, so scarce is both water and vegetation.\r\n\r\nIn the main, natural bridges are the result of one or another of several\r\ncauses. A limestone cavern may be partly destroyed by streams of water,\r\nleaving a portion of the cavern with its roof still in place; the part\r\nof the roof thus remaining becomes the arch of the bridge. A branch of\r\nthe Southern Railway threads a natural tunnel near Anniston, Ala., and\r\nthe tunnel is the remnant of an old limestone cavern.\r\n\r\nIn other cases a natural bridge is formed when bowlders, or a mass of\r\nrock, tumbling into a deep crevice is wedged and held in place. In still\r\nother instances a layer of hard or slowly weathering rock may rest upon\r\na layer of rock which weathers rapidly. In such cases, if the rock\r\nlayers form the face of a cliff, natural bridges, caverns, and overhangs\r\nare apt to result.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nSTRANGE ROCK FORMATIONS--TABLE MOUNTAIN OF CALIFORNIA\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are many table mountains in different parts of the world, but the\r\none which I am about to describe is interesting both from geological and\r\nfinancial stand-points. The so-called Table Mountain of California is a\r\nmassive natural railway embankment or colossal Chinese wall, extending\r\nthrough several counties, but best studied in Tuolumne County.\r\n\r\nThe mountain is forty miles long, from five hundred to eight hundred\r\nfeet high, and a quarter of a mile wide at the top. For the most part\r\nthe top is bare of vegetation and quite level, though slanting slightly\r\ntoward the south. In places at the base of its precipitous sides, and\r\nsometimes extending part way up, pine and other trees are found growing.\r\n\r\nThis gigantic wall, broken through in several places by flowing rivers,\r\nis nothing more nor less than a mighty stream of congealed basaltic lava\r\ncalled latite, which in prehistoric times, rushing down the western\r\nflank of the high Sierras, usurped the bed of an ancient river channel,\r\ndrinking up the waters and piling up its molten mass bank high.\r\n\r\nThe bed of the stream being filled with lava, its waters not flowing\r\nthrough the gravel, were forced to find other channels. The action of\r\nthe elements during subsequent ages has worn away in great part the\r\nbanks of the pliocene river and eroded in places the solid slate rocks\r\nto the depth of two thousand feet, leaving this sinuous wall as a mute\r\nwitness of the mighty forces of nature.\r\n\r\nOn account of the excessive hardness and durability of this kind of\r\nbasalt, this monumental fortress will endure long after the corroding\r\ntooth of time shall have crumbled to dust the royal pyramids and their\r\nvery memory shall have been lost in oblivion.\r\n\r\nSome geologists think there were two volcanic streams of lava, one\r\nsucceeding the other by an interval of thousands of years, the first\r\ncovering the auriferous gravel and the second quenching the waters of a\r\nsubsequent river which had forced a passageway through the first flow of\r\nlava.\r\n\r\nScores of tunnels have been run into the mountain to get at the gravel\r\nof this Pactolian river. Millions of dollars of gold have been extracted\r\nfrom its bed, and millions more await the tunnel, upraise, and drift of\r\nthe adventurous miner.\r\n\r\nBeginning at the top of the mountain and working downward, we find the\r\norder of materials as follows: A cap of basalt from sixty to three\r\nhundred feet thick, a bed of breccia of varying thickness, two hundred\r\nfeet of conglomerate andesitic sand (volcanic ash of the miners), a bed\r\nof pipe-clay, and then auriferous gravel resting on a bedrock of slate.\r\nIn tapping the ancient river-bed considerable water is encountered\r\nflowing through the gravel. To get rid of this water has been a problem\r\nof expense and annoyance to the miner.\r\n\r\nTo measure the time that has passed since this buried river rolled over\r\ngolden sands staggers the intellect. It is estimated that from one\r\nhundred and fifty thousand to four hundred thousand years must have\r\nelapsed.\r\n\r\nThis curiously formed mountain has been likened to a monolithian\r\nserpent. Where the Stanislaus River breaks abruptly through the mountain\r\nthe eye gazes in wonder from the crest down two thousand feet to a\r\nseemingly tiny crowded stream below, rushing madly on its way to the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nMany interesting remains of animals have been found in the gravels under\r\nthis mountain. In running a tunnel under Table Mountain some years ago,\r\nthe miners came across a large mass of tallow weighing about one hundred\r\nand fifty pounds, and in proximity were the bones and tusks of a huge\r\nanimal. Many bones and tusks of the mammoth and mastodon, not to mention\r\nthe remains of other animals, have been found in the ancient river-bed.\r\nProbably some of these elephantine animals were sporting in the water\r\nand dashing it over themselves when the stream of lava, sweeping down,\r\noverwhelmed them, trying out the tallow and preserving their skeletons\r\nfor the wonderment of civilized man.\r\n\r\nAt one place in the mountain the deep roar of a waterfall is heard. At\r\nanother, where there is a deep break, is a series of passageways and\r\ncaves where the outlaw Murietta had his hiding-place. In several places\r\non the top of the mountain, by striking the foot down hard, a hollow,\r\nreverberating sound is heard. We give in his own words the account of an\r\nexplorer's visit to the so-called Boston tunnel which runs beneath Table\r\nMountain:\r\n\r\n\"Hearing of a celebrated petrified tree in the Boston tunnel, which runs\r\nunder Table Mountain, I determined if possible to see it and procure\r\nsome specimens. After considerable inquiry I found a miner who said he\r\nknew where the tree was; that the tunnel in which it was located had\r\nbeen abandoned many years ago; that no persons had entered it for years;\r\nthat rocks were constantly falling, making it exceedingly dangerous to\r\nenter, and that very likely it was so clogged up with rocks that no one\r\ncould get to the tree. When I had expressed my great desire to see this\r\ntree, and coaxed him, at length he promised to take me to the tunnel to\r\nsee its condition, but said he would not promise to guide me into it.\r\n\r\n\"Having dressed ourselves in overalls and jumpers, with candles and\r\ngeological hammers in hand we set out for our destination. On\r\napproaching the tunnel my guide at once began to throw stones into the\r\nbushes on either side of the entrance. When asked why he threw the\r\nstones, he replied that about the mouth of old tunnels rattlesnakes are\r\nwont to resort to get out of the burning sun.\r\n\r\n\"Not finding any rattlers, we proceeded down the incline to the mouth of\r\nthe tunnel. Finding the mouth not obstructed, and lighting our candles,\r\nwe entered. Sometimes crawling on our hands and knees over fallen rock\r\nwith scarcely a foot of extra room above our heads, then stooping low,\r\nthen walking upright, again crawling between huge masses of rock and\r\nearth, and crowding between slanting monoliths, we made our way through\r\nthe mud and water dripping on us from the roof above.\r\n\r\n\"When part way in, the guide hesitated and declared that we were taking\r\nour lives in our hands if we went farther; that the five-ton rock lying\r\nin front of our path had very recently fallen from the roof, probably a\r\nweek before, possibly a day or only an hour before. Pointing to the roof\r\nwith his candle he said: 'Do you see that piece of rock partly detached\r\nand ready to fall at any moment?'\r\n\r\n\"Acknowledging the threatening conditions, I urged: 'If not too\r\ndangerous, I do wish that we might go on until we find the tree.'\r\n\r\n\"Said he: 'If you promise not to strike any of these rocks with your\r\nhammer, we will venture a little farther.'\r\n\r\n\"You may be assured that I not only promised, but obeyed.\r\n\r\n\"At this juncture, I must confess, a peculiar sensation came over me\r\nwhen I thought of the possibility of being buried alive or crushed to\r\ndeath in this subterranean cavern, yet pride kept me from showing the\r\nwhite feather.\r\n\r\n\"The guide, going ahead and examining the walls and roof, called back to\r\nme in a low voice, saying, 'We are now safer.'\r\n\r\n\"Having traversed the main tunnel for a distance of upward of eight\r\nhundred feet, and carefully avoiding its branches, we finally came to\r\nthe object of our search. This tree, four feet in diameter, of opalized\r\nwood, stands upright on the left side of the tunnel. The lava had burned\r\noff the bark and partly carbonized the outside part, and then the whole\r\nhad subsequently taken the form of opal silica. There is a space of\r\nabout four inches between the tree and the surrounding lava.\r\n\r\n\"By raising the candles above our heads we could look up the body of the\r\ntree some thirty feet. When we had broken off some choice specimens from\r\nthe body of the tree with the hammer we left this subterranean world. On\r\nemerging from the tunnel the guide said: 'Thank God, we again see the\r\nsunlight.'\r\n\r\n\"To which I replied: 'Amen.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nSTRANGE ROCK FORMATIONS--GIBRALTAR\r\n\r\n\r\nA huge projecting limestone rock, in form like a reclining lion, guards\r\nthe entrance to the narrow water passage which separates Europe from\r\nAfrica. This wonderful feature, the Rock of Gibraltar, extends directly\r\nsouthward from the mainland of Spain with which it is connected by a\r\nlow, sandy isthmus. It is about three miles in length and in breadth\r\nvaries from one-fourth to three-fourths of a mile. Two depressions\r\ndivide it into three summits, the highest of which is about fourteen\r\nhundred feet.\r\n\r\nLet us visit the small city lying at its western base and then carefully\r\nexamine this leviathan sentinel that seems to stand guard over the\r\nnarrow strait. The special permission of the military commander to\r\nexamine it or even to remain in the city must first be obtained; we are\r\nespecially warned that cameras are forbidden and all negatives will be\r\nconfiscated.\r\n\r\nThe north face we find to have an almost perpendicular height of twelve\r\nhundred feet; its east and west sides also display tremendous\r\nprecipices. The south face is much lower and slopes toward the sea.\r\nFortifications of massive walls and the best of modern guns protect the\r\nlower parts and also the seaward side of the city.\r\n\r\nBut what are those holes high up on the faces of the rock? They are\r\nportholes cut through the rock from interior chambers out of which\r\ncannon can be thrust and discharged at an invading enemy. We are curious\r\nto learn more about this interesting place, and on questioning our guide\r\nare told many remarkable stories.\r\n\r\nThe Rock of Gibraltar is honeycombed with caves, passageways, and\r\nchambers, some of which are natural and others artificial. We enter the\r\nlargest of these natural caves, St. Michael's, and as we stand in the\r\nmain hall, a spacious chamber two hundred feet in length and seventy\r\nfeet in height, we are amazed at its beauty and grandeur. Colossal\r\ncolumns of stalactites seem to support its ornamental roof and all\r\naround are fantastic figures--foliage of many forms, beautiful\r\nstatuettes, pillars, pendants, and shapes of picturesque beauty\r\nrivalling those of Mammoth Cave. St. Michael's Cave is eleven hundred\r\nfeet above sea level and is connected by winding passages with four\r\nother caves of a similar character.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: This strong and impregnable place is the Rock of\r\nGibraltar, and the city nestling at its base, Gibraltar]\r\n\r\nTo six of the caves distinct names have been given. One of the caves is\r\nthree hundred feet below sea level. About three miles of passageways,\r\nexclusive of many storage chambers, have been hewn so as to connect the\r\ndifferent caves and natural passages, and so large have they been made\r\nthat a wagon can be drawn through them. Within this rock are stored\r\nsupplies of ammunition and sufficient provisions to last several years.\r\nIn clambering about the rock we find cannon carefully concealed in\r\nscores of different places ready for use when needed.\r\n\r\nIn places the rock is overlaid with thin soil which produces a variety\r\nof vegetation. There are grassy glens, with trees, and luxuriant gardens\r\nsurrounding pretty English cottages. During the rainy season wild\r\nflowers in great profusion spring up in all directions, but in the\r\nsummer the rock presents a dry, barren aspect.\r\n\r\nThis strong and impregnable place is the Rock of Gibraltar and the city\r\nnestling at its base, Gibraltar. The city has a population of\r\ntwenty-five thousand, of whom several thousand are soldiers forming the\r\ngarrison. The garrison with their artillery, two pieces of which weigh\r\none hundred tons each, reinforced with the strongest of fortifications,\r\nare thought to be capable of withstanding the combined hosts of\r\nChristendom.\r\n\r\nEarly in the eighth century the Moors, perceiving the strategic\r\nimportance of the promontory, took possession of it and erected\r\nfortifications. During the succeeding nine hundred years the fortress\r\nwas besieged no less than twelve times, and on several occasions was\r\ncaptured by invaders.\r\n\r\nAt length it became a possession of Spain, and so strongly was it\r\nfortified by the Spanish that it was thought to be impregnable. During\r\nthe War of the Spanish Succession, however, the combined forces of\r\nEngland and Holland laid siege to it, and after a stubborn resistance\r\nthe garrison was forced to surrender. Forthwith the English took\r\npossession in the name of Queen Anne and, strengthening the\r\nfortifications, have held the fortress ever since.\r\n\r\nSpain was greatly mortified by the loss of this stronghold which she\r\ndeemed rightly belonged to her. Several times during the ensuing\r\nseventy-five years, single-handed, she laid siege to the citadel in the\r\nendeavor to win it back, but each time she signally failed.\r\n\r\nA seemingly auspicious time arrived in 1779 when she secured the\r\nco-operation of France. For the succeeding four years a relentless siege\r\nwas laid to the fortress by the combined land and naval forces of Spain\r\nand France. Both nations summoned to their aid their ablest generals and\r\nadmirals, using every conceivable device and strategy to capture the\r\nfortress, but all in vain.\r\n\r\nDuring the first years of this siege the supreme command of both land\r\nand naval forces rested with the Spanish, but, having met with failure\r\nafter failure, they were ready at length to give way to the French, who\r\npromised to capture the stronghold by constructing a powerful fleet of\r\nbattering-ships, enabling them to fight at close range, so that gun to\r\ngun and man to man should decide the contest.\r\n\r\nThe French engineer who prepared the armament cut down the huge bulwarks\r\nof the sides of ten of the Spanish battle-ships and proceeded to\r\nreconstruct them within and without. The reconstructed ships were much\r\nlike the _Merrimac_, that did such destructive work in our Civil War,\r\nexcept that they were not armored with iron. Triple beams of heavy oak\r\nwith layers of sand and cork between them were used for encasing these\r\nhuge hulks. For protecting the crews heavy timbers covered with rope and\r\nhides were used.\r\n\r\nOn September 12, 1782, fifty line-of-battle ships flying flags,\r\ntogether with a fleet of smaller vessels, lined up before the town. This\r\nformidable fleet was supported on land by an army of forty thousand men\r\nreinforced with batteries of the heaviest ordnance stretched along the\r\nshore. To oppose these the English commander, General Eliott, had\r\nninety-six pieces of artillery and seven thousand men. So confident was\r\nthe enemy of success that the triple-armored battering-ships moved\r\nboldly up to within half-gunshot range.\r\n\r\nAt a signal the English opened fire, which was instantly answered by the\r\nfloating batteries and the whole shore line; four hundred guns were then\r\nplaying on the beleaguered town. Soon death and destruction were made\r\nevident on both sides. There seemed to be but one thing for the English\r\nto do to save themselves, and that was to set fire to the enemy's ships.\r\nAccordingly, furnaces were placed beside the batteries in which heavy\r\ncannon balls were made white-hot. The guns, shotted with these glowing\r\nballs, were then turned on the ships. The enemy attempted to guard\r\nagainst the hot shot by continually pumping water into the layer of sand\r\nbetween the wooden sheathing of the ships, and for a time succeeded in\r\nextinguishing the fires.\r\n\r\nIt was not long though before the admiral's ship caught fire, and as\r\nnight drew on, the flames, indicating the position of the Spanish line,\r\nfurnished a mark for the English guns. At midnight ten of the besieging\r\nships were on fire. Rockets were thrown up and distress signals hoisted\r\nto summon aid from their consorts.\r\n\r\nThe flames mounted higher and higher, illuminating sky, sea, and rock.\r\nThe shrieks of the wounded and dying filled the midnight air. When it\r\nwas found that the ships could not be saved, all discipline was lost and\r\na panic ensued. Hundreds perished miserably, while hundreds of others\r\nthrew themselves into the sea. Seeing the terrible destruction wrought\r\nby firing hot balls, General Eliott ordered his men to man the boats in\r\norder to save their foes from drowning and burning.\r\n\r\nWith the greatest heroism they scoured the sea, and, mounting the\r\nburning vessels, dragged from the decks men deserted by their own\r\npeople. While performing these humanitarian acts several of the English\r\nperished by explosions. Three hundred and fifty-seven of the enemy were\r\nsaved from a horrible death. The following morning disclosed a sea\r\ncovered with wrecks. A few days more of feeble bombardment ensued; then\r\na treaty of peace was signed.\r\n\r\nFrom a strategic stand-point, the Rock of Gibraltar is easily Great\r\nBritain's most important stronghold, because it guards the trade route\r\nto her most important possession--British India. Practically all her\r\ncommerce with her Indian colonies passes through the Mediterranean Sea\r\nand the Suez Canal. With either one in the possession of an enemy,\r\nBritish commerce would not only suffer heavy losses, but it might be\r\ndestroyed altogether. So necessary is the command of the Strait of\r\nGibraltar to Great Britain, that to lose the Rock might also mean the\r\nloss of British India.\r\n\r\nAt the present time Great Britain is continually adding to the defences\r\nby building new fortifications and replacing the older guns with the\r\nlatest patterns.\r\n\r\nIn ancient times the name Calpe was applied to the rock of Gibraltar and\r\nAbyla to the eminence in Africa on the opposite side of the strait, and\r\nboth of these eminences formed the renowned Pillars of Hercules. For\r\ncenturies no ships navigating the Mediterranean dared sail beyond these\r\npillars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nTHE BAKU OIL FIELDS\r\n\r\n\r\nCrossing the Black Sea, we leave the steamer at Batum and take the train\r\nfor Baku, the commercial centre of the greatest oil field in the\r\nworld--a region where the supply of petroleum and natural gas seems\r\nalmost inexhaustible. Immense subterranean oil reservoirs underlie this\r\nentire region and extend eastward under the Caspian Sea and beyond to\r\nthe Balkan hills.\r\n\r\nNot only do oil and gas exude from the ground, but, as in the California\r\nfields, they come up through the sea-bottom; the oil floats on the\r\nsurface of the water and the gas, pure as that used in our cities,\r\npasses off into the air. In several places gas which bubbles up through\r\nthe sea-water may be ignited; then for a long distance the sea seems to\r\nbe aflame. In many places on the land a fire for lighting or heating\r\npurposes is made by thrusting a pipe down into the ground and igniting\r\nthe gas which rises in the tube.\r\n\r\nThe waters of the Caspian Sea along the Baku shore are usually fine for\r\nbathing, but if the wind blows inland for a while the oil floating on\r\nits surface accumulates, forming a black scum on the top, putting an end\r\nto the bathers' sport until an offshore wind sets in.\r\n\r\nTen miles from Baku, once upon a time, there was a temple over a cleft\r\nin the rocks from which gas arises. The gas was kept burning, tended by\r\nParsee priests, for more than two thousand years and until the advent of\r\nthe modern oil well. This flame was a special object of adoration by the\r\nfire-worshippers who were the followers of Zoroaster, and many went\r\nthere to pay homage to it.\r\n\r\nIn this region one may travel for miles and miles without seeing a tree,\r\nshrub, or blade of grass. The landscape consists of a rolling surface of\r\nrocks and sand. It is barren, dry, and destitute of all objects of\r\ninterest. Sometimes for six months or more not a drop of rain falls to\r\nlay the dust. If we go into the section where oil-wells are sunk, a\r\nslight relief to the view is afforded by the mounds of sand marking the\r\nsites of oil wells, derricks, the inky petroleum lakes, and the huge\r\niron reservoirs. But all around is dry and dusty save where the oil has\r\nmingled with the earth; there the surroundings are not only unpleasant\r\nto sight and smell but ruinous to peace of mind as well.\r\n\r\nFor twenty-five centuries this region has been famous for its petroleum,\r\nand for upward of a thousand years the surrounding peoples have had\r\nrecourse to these springs to obtain supplies of oil for medicinal and\r\ndomestic purposes. Herodotus has given an interesting description of\r\nthem. Even in the early part of the twelfth century petroleum was an\r\nimportant article of export from Baku. Crude petroleum was used to\r\nanoint camels for mange. In the first part of the eighteenth century\r\nPeter the Great annexed Baku to Russia. After his death it was ceded\r\nback to Persia; but in 1801 it was again annexed to Russia.\r\n\r\nTo-day Baku is one of the important commercial cities of the Russian\r\nEmpire. Its shipping is immense and to further its commerce there are\r\nmagnificent docks. The city is built on the shores of a large bay,\r\nsheltered from adverse winds by an island that acts as a breakwater. The\r\nwater-front has an anchorage for thousands of vessels. One may walk\r\nalong the strand for eight miles and find ships lined up in front of the\r\ncity the entire distance.\r\n\r\nThe Caspian is filled with various kinds of fish, and while bathing one\r\nmight reasonably have the impression that he was swimming in an\r\naquarium. In fact, this place is an ideal one for an Izaak Walton. On\r\nthe islands beyond the peninsula, projecting out from the Baku section,\r\npetroleum gas has flamed for centuries, lighting the heavens at night\r\nwith a lurid glare that is visible far out at sea.\r\n\r\nIn Baku Bay, between two peninsulas, there was a spot, now\r\ncommercialized into a producing oil well, where the gas came to the\r\nsurface with sufficient force to upset small boats. Many of the oil\r\nwells are spouters for a long time after they are first bored, and when\r\nthey cease to spout they can frequently be made to renew their activity\r\nby deeper boring.\r\n\r\nWells have been pumped for years without the level of the oil being\r\nlowered in the slightest. Some of the wells which have caught fire\r\naccidentally have burned for years, sending up their pillars of fire to\r\na great height. In a few instances the richest wells have made the\r\nowners practically bankrupt by overwhelming the buildings on adjoining\r\nproperty with sand and petroleum, spreading ruin far and wide before the\r\nflow could be checked.\r\n\r\nA majority of the great oil wells are about ten miles from Baku, and a\r\ndozen pipe-lines convey the petroleum from them to Black Town, a suburb\r\nof Baku, where it is stored and refined. From one well alone the\r\nescaping oil would have brought more than five million dollars had it\r\nbeen saved.\r\n\r\nSeemingly the crust of the earth for hundreds of miles around acts like\r\na huge gasometer pressing down on the pent-up gases with its weight.\r\nSince the Caspian Sea is eighty feet below sea level, it is probable\r\nthat the land bordering the sea has sunk since the gases and oil were\r\nformed. And this would, in part at least, account for the enormous\r\npressure.\r\n\r\nThe spouting oil wells are called fountains. Some of them have yielded\r\ntwo million gallons each day for months, sending up jets three or four\r\nhundred feet high with a roar that could be heard several miles away.\r\nGreat difficulty was found at first in stopping the flow when necessary\r\nby capping or gagging the wells, but after a time a sliding valve-cap\r\nwas invented, capable of checking the flow of the most violent well. In\r\norder to prevent the enormous pressure from bursting the pipe and\r\ntearing up the ground, as soon as the pipe has been sunk part way the\r\nearth is excavated around it and the excavation is filled with cement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Landing-place for commerce on the Caspian Sea]\r\n\r\nIt is said that one of these gushers threw up in a day more oil than is\r\nproduced by all the wells in the United States. One well spouted oil for\r\nmonths before it could be gagged, and in the meantime flooded the\r\nsurrounding country. Millions of gallons were burned to get rid of it\r\nand millions more were diverted into the Caspian Sea. Two wells are\r\nreported to have thrown up in less than a month thirty million gallons\r\neach.\r\n\r\nAt first sand is thrown out with the oil, and frequently it is ejected\r\nwith such force that a plate of iron three inches thick struck by the\r\nstream is worn through in less than a day by this liquid sand blast.\r\nWhen the wells cease spouting and it is not deemed advisable to bore\r\ndeeper, pumping is employed. Generally the oil coming from the wells is\r\nconducted into large, carefully tamped excavations in the ground forming\r\nponds or lakes. In these huge reservoirs the sand and heavier parts soon\r\nsink, making the bottom impervious. After the settling the petroleum is\r\neither pumped into large iron tanks or sent directly to the refinery by\r\npipe-lines.\r\n\r\nSince petroleum is vastly cheaper than coal, the steamers plying on the\r\nCaspian Sea and the locomotives of many of the Russian railroads use oil\r\nfor fuel. At one time so great was the accumulation of petroleum that it\r\nsold at the wells for a few cents a ton. A fleet of tank-steamers\r\nconveys the oil products to the interior of Russia by the Caspian Sea\r\nand Volga River route.\r\n\r\nThe crude petroleum of Baku yields a lower percentage of kerosene than\r\nthe American wells, but it contains more lubricating oil. Millions of\r\ngallons of lubricating oil are shipped from Baku each year to all parts\r\nof Europe. On the opposite side of the Caspian there are great cliffs of\r\nmineral wax such as is obtained from petroleum and used extensively in\r\nthe manufacture of paraffin candles.\r\n\r\nMore than two hundred different products are made from petroleum, among\r\nthe chief of which are kerosene, lubricating oil, benzine, gasoline,\r\nvaseline, and paraffin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nTHE SOUTH AFRICAN DIAMOND FIELDS\r\n\r\n\r\nMany of the great treasure fields of the world have been discovered by\r\nchance rather than careful search.\r\n\r\nThe diamonds of the Deccan, India, were trodden under foot for ages\r\nbefore they were recognized as diamonds. In Brazil the gold placer\r\nminers threw away the glassy pebbles as worthless and the black slaves\r\nused them as counters in their card games. A visitor who was acquainted\r\nwith the diamond fields of India happened one day to notice the shining\r\nstones which two men were using in a card game at a public-house. The\r\nbrilliancy of the pebbles piqued his curiosity. Having secured some, he\r\ntested them and found them to be diamonds of the first water. Yet so\r\ngreat was the prejudice against the Brazilian diamonds at first that for\r\nyears many were secretly shipped to India and thence sent to the diamond\r\nmarket as Indian diamonds.\r\n\r\nA trivial circumstance often leads to a marvellous change in the\r\nconditions of men, communities, and nations. The playful act of a Boer\r\nlad picking up a shining pebble on the banks of the Orange River served\r\nas a beacon to lure persons to search for the most precious and hardest\r\nof gems, the diamond, and thereby transformed South Africa.\r\n\r\nIt was the beginning of an industry that has already added more than\r\nfour hundred million dollars' worth of wealth to the world and which now\r\nyields annually twenty million dollars' worth of diamonds. The history\r\nof the South African diamond mines is a fascinating story from start to\r\nfinish.\r\n\r\nA Boer farmer named Jacobs had made his home on the banks of the Orange\r\nRiver not far from Hopetown. Here, living in a squalid hovel, he eked\r\nout a precarious existence by hunting and grazing. His chief income was\r\nfrom the flocks of sheep and goats that grazed on the scanty herbage of\r\nthe veld. Black servants were the shepherds, and the children, having no\r\nwork to employ their time, were free to roam over karoo, and veld, and\r\nalong the river.\r\n\r\nWhat children are not attracted by pebbly streams? Wading in the water\r\nand skating flat stones on its surface was a joyous pastime for them.\r\nThe banks of the river were strewn with stones of various colors and\r\nsizes such as would naturally attract the eyes of children.\r\n\r\nThere were rich red garnets, variegated jaspers, chalcedonies and agates\r\nof many hues mingled with rock-crystals. The children would fill their\r\npockets with these colored pebbles and carry them home to use in play.\r\n\r\nOne day the farmer's wife noticed an unusually brilliant pebble among\r\nthe other stones that were being tossed about by the children. Soon\r\nafter she told one of her neighbors that the children had found a\r\ncurious glassy stone that sparkled brilliantly in the sunlight. On his\r\nexpressing a desire to see the stone, it was brought to him covered with\r\ndirt. He was attracted by its brilliance and, probably surmising that it\r\nwas more valuable than common quartz crystal, offered to purchase it.\r\nThe good-wife scorned the idea of taking money for a smooth stone, and\r\ntold him laughingly that he was welcome to it.\r\n\r\nThe stone was sent by post to Grahamtown to ascertain whether or not it\r\nwas of value. To the astonishment of all concerned it was pronounced a\r\ngenuine diamond and was sold for twenty-five hundred dollars. A search\r\nwas forthwith made in the locality for other stones, but none was found.\r\nTen months later a second diamond was found thirty miles away on the\r\nbank of the same river. Then quite a number of fine diamonds were found\r\nby prospectors along the Vaal River.\r\n\r\nIn 1869 a black shepherd boy found a magnificent white diamond which was\r\npurchased for five hundred sheep, ten oxen, and a horse. The purchaser\r\nsold the gem for fifty-five thousand dollars, and it was subsequently\r\nresold for one hundred thousand dollars. This superb gem became famous\r\nas the star of South Africa.\r\n\r\nAlthough a few skeptics said these stones might have been brought from\r\nthe far interior in the crops of ostriches, yet this last great find\r\nserved to attract public notice, and soon thousands of prospectors came\r\nto seek the coveted gems. Even the stolid Boer caught the excitement,\r\nand trekked long distances with wife and children to reach the\r\ncaptivating fields.\r\n\r\nIt was a motley throng, like a mighty stream, which poured into the\r\nvalley of the Vaal. Men came hurrying in all sorts of ways, afoot, on\r\nhorseback, and in heavy, creaking ox-wagons. For miles and miles men\r\nwere quickly at work sinking holes into the ground; camp-fires were\r\nflaming; teamsters were inspanning and outspanning their oxen, and\r\nwagons were creaking. These, with raucous voices shouting in a babel of\r\nlanguages, made a pandemonium exciting enough for the most adventurous.\r\n\r\nAs far as the eye could reach along the banks of the Vaal were seen\r\nhives of busy, hopeful men who believed that untold riches were almost\r\nwithin their grasp. The hardest of work was but a pastime, for if they\r\ndid not find diamonds to-day, would they not to-morrow? Did not their\r\nneighbors find them? The next shovelful of earth might contain a\r\nprecious gem. They could hardly afford time to eat or sleep. Flashing\r\neyes and elastic steps marked the success of some, while others\r\nrepressed their feelings and kept their own counsel regarding the extent\r\nof their finds.\r\n\r\nSo great did the crowd become that it was necessary to limit claims, and\r\nat an informal meeting of the prospectors, a digging committee was\r\nformed to make regulations controlling the working of the digging.\r\nThirty feet square was thought to be a reasonable claim for one person.\r\nSome sought the river's banks to prospect, others the kopjes or hills.\r\nSome pinned their faith to light-colored ground, others to dark. Fancy\r\nrather than reason dictated the choice.\r\n\r\nThe manner of working a claim was simple. The earth was thrown into a\r\ncradle having a bottom of perforated zinc or of wire mesh. The cradle\r\nwas then rapidly rocked to and fro as water was poured in upon the\r\nearth. The finer part was washed through the mesh and the worthless\r\nstones were thrown out by hand. The residue was then removed to a\r\nsuitable place and carefully examined.\r\n\r\nEach person most vigilantly scrutinized his hoard, fearing that in an\r\nunguarded moment a fortune might slip through his hands and be lost.\r\nEven the stranger passing along was hardly given a glance, so eager was\r\neach individual in searching for the precious pebble.\r\n\r\nThere is an entrancing interest in diamond mining far exceeding that of\r\ngold, for at any moment one is likely to come across a princely fortune.\r\nThe miner is ever hopeful. Communing with himself, he says: \"To-morrow I\r\nmay be made independent by a lucky find.\" And for a time it was merely\r\nluck, for so irregularly distributed were the diamonds that no knowledge\r\nwas gained as to where they were most likely to be found.\r\n\r\nWhile miners were strenuously working along the rivers, far more\r\nwonderful diamond regions were soon to be unfolded; regions rich beyond\r\nthe loftiest nights of the imagination and equal to the fabled valley of\r\nSindbad the Sailor.\r\n\r\nA thrifty Dutch vrau owned a farm, on a volcanic plateau extending for\r\nmiles into the rocky kopjes. Her overseer, learning that garnets are\r\noften found associated with diamonds, and noticing some garnets in one\r\nof the small streams that coursed through the valley, concluded to do a\r\nlittle prospecting on his own account. Sinking a hole a few feet in\r\ndepth and sifting the sand and gravel through a common sieve, he came\r\nacross a diamond weighing fifty carats--nearly half an ounce.\r\n\r\nThis find caused a rush to the farm to secure claims, and the widow,\r\nwith an eye to business, charged a monthly license of ten dollars. Soon\r\nthis discovery was eclipsed by a more remarkable one at Dutoitspan[4] in\r\n1870. Although a fair supply of diamonds was found near the surface,\r\nthese diggings seemed to give out as they reached hard limestone.\r\n\r\nWhen nearly all of the prospectors had left the field, having become\r\ndiscouraged, one more sanguine than the others determined to find out\r\nwhat was beneath this limestone covering. Sinking a shaft, he found that\r\nthe limestone grew so soft and friable that it could be easily dug out\r\nwith a pick. When he had penetrated the limestone covering he came in\r\ncontact with a hard layer somewhat of the nature of clay. This he\r\nproceeded to break up and sift. During the sifting process he observed\r\nmany sparkling gems. The problem had been partly solved at least.\r\nDiamonds were to be found in greater abundance below than above the\r\nlimestone covering. On learning of the changed condition of affairs the\r\ndeserting miners hastened back to the diggings in double-quick time.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1871 diamonds were found at Bultfontein[5] and on the De Beers\r\nfarm, two miles from Dutoitspan. Five months later another bed of\r\ndiamonds was found on the same farm, lying on a sloping kopje, one mile\r\nfrom the first location. This kopje, named Colesberg Kopje, became\r\nafterward the famous Kimberley mine. The district was immediately\r\ndivided into claims and taken by prospectors.\r\n\r\nThe climate of this section is exceedingly trying. A blazing sun, clouds\r\nof suffocating dust, and a scanty supply of muddy water are the\r\nconditions of the region; it therefore required remarkable physical\r\nendurance and an indomitable will to achieve results. Sometimes terrific\r\nthunder-storms with torrents of rain would sweep through the valley. At\r\nother times great hail-storms would drive both man and beast to the\r\nnearest shelter. Wind-storms frequently drove blinding clouds of dust\r\nthat penetrated everything.\r\n\r\nVery quickly a city of tents sprang up at Kimberley to be superseded\r\nlater by substantial buildings of wood, of brick and iron, and\r\nwell-constructed streets. Water was pumped from the Vaal River through a\r\nmain sixteen miles in length. It was then raised in three lifts by\r\npowerful engines to a large reservoir five hundred feet above the river.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of an abundant supply of good water wrought a wonderful\r\ntransformation. Outside the business section the desert was made to\r\nblossom with flowers in gardens surrounding the hitherto bleak homes.\r\nLawns were laid out and vines and trees planted about the houses, making\r\nthe dusty, wind-swept expanse a thing of beauty and comfort.\r\n\r\nAt length prospectors learned that the diamond-bearing earth was\r\nconfined chiefly to several oval-shaped funnels, ranging in area from\r\nten to twenty acres, and that outside these few diamonds were to be\r\nfound.\r\n\r\nNow these huge funnels, or pipes, are nothing more or less than extinct\r\nvolcanic craters. The walls, or casings, of these pipes are chiefly of\r\nshale and basalt filled with hard earth, yellow near the surface and\r\nbluish deeper down. The latter is called \"blue-stuff\" and is very\r\nprolific in diamonds. The diamonds found outside the rim wall must have\r\nbeen washed out of the craters or perhaps were thrown out by the\r\neruption.\r\n\r\nAt first it was customary to pulverize the blue-stuff at once, but\r\nexperience showed that a more satisfactory way to work it was to expose\r\nit for several months to the action of the weather. By this process it\r\nreadily crumbled.\r\n\r\nVarious devices were used by the different miners to raise the earth out\r\nof their claims. Some used windlasses; others carried the earth up in\r\nbuckets and tubs, some even by climbing ladders. Surrounding the funnels\r\nwere carts, wheelbarrows, etc., for carrying away the material to the\r\ndepositing grounds, where it was dried, pulverized, and sifted.\r\n\r\nMany of the miners found it desirable to employ the native Kafirs to\r\nwork in the pits, since neither the scorching sun nor clouds of dust\r\nseemed to trouble them.\r\n\r\nThe deeper the pits were sunk the greater the difficulty became in\r\nraising the blue-stuff. To add to the difficulties the rim wall of shale\r\nand basalt began to fall in, and the rain made the claims muddy and\r\nslippery or filled them with water. At a still greater depth water began\r\nto seep through the shale wall, and great masses of the rim occasionally\r\nfell in endangering life and almost precluding further mining unless\r\nconcerted action were taken. So, in order to effect more economical\r\nmethods of working, a consolidation of claims began to take place.\r\n\r\nAt the Kimberley mine a double platform with staging was built around\r\nthe pit, and a series of wires running from the different claims served\r\nas trackways on which buckets of the blue-stuff were drawn up by means\r\nof ropes and windlasses located on these platforms.\r\n\r\nWhen still greater depth had been reached and much of the rim wall had\r\nbeen precipitated into the pit and rain and seepage water had made the\r\npits mud holes, two remarkable persons who were interested in the mines\r\ntook a leading part in solving the difficulties. These persons were\r\nCecil John Rhodes and Barnett Isaacs, better known as \"Barney Barnato.\"\r\nRhodes owned stock in the De Beers and Barnato in the Kimberley mine. At\r\nfirst they were sharp rivals in gaining control, but later they got\r\ntogether and consolidated interests.\r\n\r\nCecil Rhodes was an English college student. He had lost his health and\r\nhad come to South Africa at the invitation of his brother, who was\r\ninterested in the diamond mines. Roughly dressed, his clothes covered\r\nwith dust, this shy, pale student, week in and week out, might be seen\r\nlooking after the Kafirs who worked his brother's claim.\r\n\r\nBarney Barnato, a young Hebrew of keen foresight, likewise had a brother\r\nin South Africa. The latter, who was engaged in diamond buying, urged\r\nBarney to come at once to this famous region, setting forth the\r\nwonderful opportunities offered for business. Barnato forthwith packed\r\nhis few belongings and took the next steamer for Cape Town. He was only\r\ntwenty years old and was bubbling over with good-natured energy; but he\r\nwas quick to perceive and quick to act.\r\n\r\nAlthough he had but a few dollars with which to start in business, yet\r\nby indomitable energy and shrewd management he soon acquired sufficient\r\nmoney to buy a few small claims in the famous Kimberley mine. To these\r\nclaims he constantly added others until he became one of the leading\r\nstockholders in the mine.\r\n\r\nWhen the rival mines began to undersell each other and diamonds were\r\nbeing sold for but little more than the cost of production, Rhodes\r\nconceived the plan of consolidating all the mines, thereby forming a\r\nmonopoly to keep up the prices. By masterly skill he brought this\r\nabout, purchasing some shares outright, and giving shares in the new\r\ncompany as payment for others. To make the purchases he negotiated a\r\nloan of several million dollars through the Rothschilds, the famous\r\nbankers of London.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Open workings of the diamond mine, Kimberley]\r\n\r\nThus, after many years of struggle through difficulties that were\r\nseemingly superhuman, the four great mines, the De Beers, Kimberley,\r\nDutoitspan, and Bultfontein, were merged into one great corporation.\r\nAfterward some others were added, but all bear the name De Beers\r\nConsolidated Mines, Limited, a corporation which to-day controls the\r\ndiamond market of the world. During the eleven years ending 1899 they\r\nyielded nearly six tons of diamonds.\r\n\r\nBoth Rhodes and Barnato acquired immense wealth by their investments,\r\nbut it is doubtful if either gained much happiness from his\r\nacquisitions. Poor Barnato! He had gained riches and stood among the\r\nforemost financiers of the world, but at how fearful a cost! His\r\novertaxed brain began to give way, and on his way back to England he\r\nsuddenly leaped overboard and was drowned.\r\n\r\nCecil Rhodes was instrumental in enlarging British influence and\r\nterritory in South Africa, and to him England owes a deep debt of\r\ngratitude. He died in 1902 leaving a portion of his immense fortune for\r\nscholarships in Oxford, England's great university. Rhodes earnestly\r\nadvocated the building of a railroad from Cape Town to Cairo. Already\r\nthis line has been constructed northward from Cape Town several hundred\r\nmiles beyond Victoria Falls, directly below which it crosses the Zambezi\r\nRiver.\r\n\r\nDiamonds of various colors are found in the African mines--brown,\r\nyellow, pale blue, clear, and black. The black diamonds, called bort,\r\nare used mainly for arming diamond drills and for polishing other\r\ndiamonds. Green, pink, and mauve diamonds are found occasionally.\r\n\r\nThe De Beers mines have produced some notable stones. From the Premier\r\nmine a diamond weighing more than three thousand carats--one and\r\nthirty-seven hundredths pounds avoirdupois--was obtained. This stone,\r\nmore than twice the size of any heretofore found and estimated to be\r\nworth five million dollars, was insured for two million five hundred\r\nthousand dollars. It was named the Cullinan, from one Tom Cullinan, who\r\npurchased the farm on which the Premier mine is located.\r\n\r\nCaptain Wells, the manager of the Premier, one evening, after a burning\r\nhot day, when work had been suspended, strolled over to the mine, and,\r\nwhile partly walking and partly sliding down into the pit, noticed a\r\ngleam from a stone half-embedded in the earth. In a moment he had the\r\nstone in his hand and his practised eye told him this was the greatest\r\ndiamond the world ever saw.\r\n\r\nAt first the possession of it seemed more like a dream than a reality,\r\nand he began to doubt his own sanity. When held up to the blazing\r\nSouthern Cross, it sparkled like the purest crystal, and he knew that\r\nits value must be reckoned in hundreds of thousands of dollars.\r\n\r\nHe immediately took the priceless treasure to the company's office where\r\nit was critically examined. It was then sent for safe-keeping to the\r\nStandard Bank at Johannesburg, and afterward was forwarded to London.\r\nFor some time it was deposited in a London bank, the name of which was\r\nkept secret for fear that its great value might tempt criminals. Two\r\nyears after its discovery it was purchased by the Transvaal Government,\r\nat the suggestion of General Botha, and presented to King Edward VII as\r\na crown jewel.\r\n\r\nThe De Beers Company employs upward of eleven thousand African\r\nnatives--Kafirs, they are called--working above and below ground. They\r\ncome not only from the surrounding districts but from regions hundreds\r\nof miles away. All native laborers are kept in large walled enclosures,\r\nor compounds, which are covered with wire netting to prevent the\r\nlaborers from throwing diamonds over the walls to confederates outside.\r\nTwelve such enclosures are owned by the De Beers Company, the largest of\r\nwhich occupies four acres and contains ample space for housing three\r\nthousand natives.\r\n\r\nOn entering the service of the company each applicant must sign a\r\ncontract to live in the compound and work faithfully at least three\r\nmonths. At the expiration of his contract he may leave or make another\r\ncontract, as he wills.\r\n\r\nConstant vigilance is maintained in order to prevent stealing diamonds,\r\nand yet, notwithstanding this watchfulness, it is estimated that\r\nhundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of diamonds are stolen each\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nEverything necessary for the sustenance and comfort of the men is\r\nbrought into the compounds, and no one is permitted to leave until the\r\nexpiration of his contract except by permission of the overseer, which\r\nis seldom given. The men go out of the compounds to their work through\r\ntunnels and return the same way.\r\n\r\nBesides the native Kafirs already mentioned, about two thousand white\r\nlaborers are employed, the greater number being engaged in the offices\r\nand workshops and on the depositing floors.\r\n\r\nElectric lights are used throughout the mines, and underground work is\r\ncarried on both day and night by three shifts. Every known scientific\r\ndevice is pressed into service. In all of the deep mines the laborers\r\nare taken up and down the shafts in cages.\r\n\r\nThe method of mining and working the diamond-bearing earth at present\r\nemployed is far more economical than in former years. After the blue\r\nmaterial has been brought up it is carried to the depositing floors\r\nwhere it is allowed to remain several months. In the meanwhile it is\r\nharrowed several times to break the lumps. The part that resists this\r\ntreatment is carried to a mill to be crushed. The disintegrated and\r\npulverized material is then carried to the washing machines.\r\n\r\nThe coarser fragments of the concentrates from the washing machines are\r\npicked out by hand; the finer are sent to the pulsators. Each\r\nshaking-table of the pulsators is made of corrugated iron plates in\r\nseveral sections with a drop of about an inch from one division to\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nA sufficient quantity of thick grease is spread over the plates to cover\r\nthem to the top of the corrugations. The concentrates are continuously\r\nspread over the upper portion of the table automatically while running\r\nwater washes them down.\r\n\r\nStrange as it may seem, the diamonds stick fast to the grease; the other\r\nmaterial is washed away. It has been found by trial that grease will\r\ncling to the precious stones but to nothing else. After a few hours the\r\ngrease with the diamonds is scraped off the tables and steamed in\r\nperforated vessels to separate them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sorting gravel for diamonds in the Kimberley mine]\r\n\r\nOne of the De Beers mines has been worked to a depth of about two\r\nthousand feet with no diminution in the quantity or quality of the\r\ndiamonds. The \"pipe\" or plug of blue-stuff shows no signs of giving out.\r\nNature, in her underground laboratory, works in a mysterious way,\r\nbaffling the astutest students of science to find the process by which\r\nshe is able to manufacture such beautiful gems as the diamond. Many\r\ntheories have been propounded to explain the genesis of the diamond, the\r\nmost plausible one being that the crystallization of the carbon is due\r\nto a very high temperature and tremendous pressure acting on the carbon\r\nin a liquid form deep down beneath the earth's surface. The crystals,\r\nintermingled with much foreign matter, are afterward projected upward,\r\nfilling these great volcanic pipes.\r\n\r\nIn order to produce the most beautiful effect, diamonds are usually cut\r\ninto one or another of three different forms, namely, rose, table, and\r\nbrilliant, the shape and size of the stone determining which form is\r\nbest. The double-cut brilliant is the most common form at the present\r\nday. The general form of rough, crystallized diamonds is that of two\r\nsquare pyramids joined at their bases. The crystals are oftenest found\r\noctahedral and dodecahedral--that is, eight and twelve sided, and the\r\ndiamond-cutter takes advantage of these forms in shaping the diamond.\r\n\r\nThe modern lapidary must have a perfect knowledge of optics and be a\r\nskilful stone-cutter. The numerous planes or faces which he cuts on the\r\nsurface of the diamond are called facets. In the treatment three\r\ndistinct processes are utilized--cleaving, cutting, and polishing. The\r\nlapidary must study the individual character of each stone and determine\r\nwhether to cleave or grind off the superfluous matter so as to correct\r\nflaws and imperfections. All this calls for the judgment which comes\r\nonly with long experience, for if the cutter errs he may ruin a\r\npriceless gem.\r\n\r\nThe grinding and polishing are done by diamond dust mixed with oil\r\nspread on the upper surface of a grooved flat steel wheel revolving\r\nhorizontally. The diamond, having been set in fusible solder, is firmly\r\npressed against the surface of the wheel by a small projecting arm and\r\nclamp. When one facet has been finished, the diamond is removed from the\r\nsolder and reset for grinding another facet. Thus the workman continues\r\nuntil the grinding and polishing are completed. Infinite patience and\r\nsteadiness of nerve, as well as steadiness of hand, are required for\r\nsuch delicate and exact work. Sometimes two uncut stones are cemented\r\ninto the ends of two sticks. Then the operator, using these sticks as\r\nhandles, presses the stones against each other with a rubbing motion,\r\nthe surface of the stones being coated over with diamond dust and oil to\r\naccelerate the process.\r\n\r\nThe last cutting of the celebrated Kohinoor diamond cost forty thousand\r\ndollars. One may understand, therefore, that the expense of cutting a\r\nlarge diamond adds materially to its cost. The diamond-cutting industry\r\nis confined chiefly to Amsterdam, where the work employs several\r\nthousand persons, mostly Hebrews, the craft having been handed down from\r\nfather to son through several generations. Much fine cutting is now done\r\nin New York also.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: The term pan is a name applied to a basin or pool in which\r\nwater collects during the rainy season.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Fontein is a word of Dutch origin meaning fountain or\r\nspring. In this hot and semi-arid country a pan or fontein was a\r\nnecessity to the Boer farmer, whose chief dependence was on his sheep\r\nand cattle.

After spending several years in the Orient, Polo returned\r\nhome in 1295, giving such marvellous accounts of the countries visited\r\nand things seen that his stories were but half believed.\r\n\r\nIn 1531, Balboa, a Spanish explorer stationed at Darien, now Colon,\r\nhearing rumors that a great ocean lay to the opposite side, determined\r\nto test the truth of the report. Taking with him about three hundred\r\nmen, he laboriously worked his way through the jungles of the isthmus;\r\nand on reaching the top of the divide beheld for the first time the\r\nPacific Ocean. He then hastened forward, and as he reached the shore he\r\nwaded into the water and took possession of it in the name of his\r\nsovereign. He named it the South Sea.\r\n\r\nBut the vast extent of this sheet of water did not become well known\r\nuntil fifty years later, when brave Ferdinand Magellan circumnavigated\r\nthe globe. Two and one-half centuries more elapsed before the memorable\r\nvoyages and discoveries of Captain Cook disclosed the fact that the new\r\nocean world was studded with countless islands, and that most of them\r\nwere densely inhabited by savages.\r\n\r\nJust how or when all these islands became inhabited is not definitely\r\nknown. Since the Polynesian languages in general are similar, it is\r\nconjectured that the inhabitants of the islands have a common origin and\r\nthat many of the more northerly groups were peopled by emigrants from\r\nthe south.\r\n\r\nIn a general way the name Oceania is applied to all of the islands in\r\nthe Pacific, but in a more limited sense only to those lying between the\r\nAmerican continent and Australasia.\r\n\r\nThe chief divisions of Oceania are Australasia, Melanesia, Micronesia,\r\nand Polynesia. Australia, the largest body of land, is usually regarded\r\nas a continent. Nearly all the smaller islands are of coral or of\r\nvolcanic origin; in many instances both agencies have contributed to\r\ntheir formation. The coral and volcanic islands seem to be the tops of\r\nmountain ranges that, little by little, have sunk, until only their\r\nhigher summits are now above sea level.\r\n\r\nThe central part of the Pacific Ocean is pre-eminently the home of the\r\nreef-building coral. Countless islands and reefs, wholly or partly built\r\nup by these tiny creatures, are found widely scattered over an immense\r\narea limited to one thousand eight hundred miles on each side of the\r\nequator. All these formations are composed of the compact limestone\r\nremains of coral polyps.\r\n\r\nThese polyps have the power of extracting carbonate of lime from the\r\nsea-water and building it into massive formations which, for the most\r\npart, are nearly or completely submerged.\r\n\r\nThe reef-building coral differs very materially in form and appearance\r\nfrom the precious or red coral; the former is confined to comparatively\r\nshallow water, while the latter is found most commonly at a depth of\r\nsix hundred feet or more, and it occurs chiefly in the Mediterranean\r\nSea. The common or reef-building coral has but little use except as a\r\nsource of lime, and no intrinsic value except as an object of curiosity.\r\n\r\nCoral reefs may be arranged under three classes; namely, fringing reefs,\r\nbarrier reefs, and atolls. The first class embraces the shallow-water\r\nreefs found close to land, either surrounding islands or skirting the\r\nshores of continents. The reefs of the second class likewise skirt\r\nislands or continents, but at such distances as to leave a deep channel\r\nbetween them and the shore. The third class are called atolls; each is\r\nirregularly ring-shaped and almost entirely encloses a sheet of water,\r\ncalled a lagoon.\r\n\r\nThe ring-shaped reef, or atoll, is broken in one or more places,\r\ngenerally on the leeward side, and built up higher on the windward side.\r\nThe reason for such omissions and buildings is obvious when we remember\r\nthat the coral animal cannot move from its fixed position to seek food,\r\nbut must depend upon the waves to bring it within reach. The water\r\ndashing up against the reef on the windward side brings an abundance of\r\nfood, while the slight movement of the waves on the leeward side brings\r\nbut little food.\r\n\r\nAfter many years the dead coral is broken off and piled up on the reef.\r\nIn this condition it is cemented by the lime in the sea-water, thereby\r\nforming a nucleus for land. Then, perchance, a cocoanut drifts upon the\r\nformation and, finding sufficient nutriment, sends down a root and\r\nbegins its growth. Other cocoanuts are drifted to the newly\r\ndisintegrated coral soil until the tropical vegetation becomes capable\r\nof sustaining animal life. Or, perhaps, a portion of the ocean bed in\r\nthat particular region is uplifted by the volcanic forces, thus greatly\r\nenlarging the land area. Attracted by the new land, people from near-by\r\nislands emigrate and take possession of the unoccupied area. Thus the\r\nupbuilding of islands and their occupancy goes on through the centuries.\r\n\r\nFrom the fact that these formations exist at a depth of several thousand\r\nfeet, while coral polyps themselves can live only near the surface, it\r\nis thought that either the sea bottom must have been sinking for a long\r\nperiod of time or else that the cinder cones around which the reefs are\r\nbuilt must have shrunk away until their tops are below sea level. At all\r\nevents they seem to be due to volcanic movement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Malay girl]\r\n\r\nDifferences in environment produce marked differences on people in\r\nvarious parts of the continental world. Likewise, differences in the\r\ngeological structure of the islands of the Pacific have produced a\r\nmarked influence on the inhabitants of the islands of the Pacific. Those\r\nliving on large and mountainous islands, where the productions are\r\nvaried and abundant, are greatly superior mentally and physically to\r\nthose inhabiting the small low-lying coral islands.\r\n\r\nIn the small islands, where there are few objects of interest and the\r\ncircle of life is necessarily circumscribed and food and building\r\nmaterial scanty, the inhabitants are dwarfed in intellect and their\r\nlanguages limited in vocabulary. The inhabitants of the extensive\r\nPaumoto group of islands give a striking example of the dreary monotony\r\nof life on small coral islands. Indeed, coral atolls are lacking in\r\npretty nearly all the features that are necessary for a high degree of\r\ncivilization; nature, therefore, reacts, with the result that the human\r\nlife of this region is in a condition of savagery. Many of the natives\r\nare cannibals.\r\n\r\nThe natives of Australia are a race that seems to be separate and\r\ndistinct in itself. Wherever they are found their speech and customs are\r\nso nearly alike that little or no doubt of their common origin exists.\r\nThey are so small in stature that by some scholars they are classed with\r\npygmy peoples. They are repulsive in appearance in their native state,\r\nbut when the children are trained by English families they become\r\nattractive. They are regarded as a very low type of intellect; yet at\r\nthe missionary schools the children seem to learn about as quickly as do\r\nEuropean children. The children learn to figure readily, but the older\r\nnatives have no names for numbers greater than three or four.\r\n\r\nIn New Guinea and the adjacent islands is found a race of black peoples\r\nusually called Negritos, or Negroids. They are black and, like the\r\nAfrican negroes, have black, kinky hair. They are far superior to the\r\nnative Australians. Many of the tribes are good farmers, and cultivate\r\ncrops of sago, maize, and tobacco. On the coasts there are good\r\nboat-builders and sailors. The greater part of the Melanesian tribes is\r\nhostile and blood-thirsty; head-hunting is a common practice. In many\r\ntribes the people live in communal houses like those of the Pueblo\r\nIndians of America.\r\n\r\nA large part of the population of Oceania is of Malay origin. As a rule\r\nthe Malaysians are intelligent and take readily to western civilization.\r\nThey are confined chiefly to the larger islands south and west of the\r\nAsian continent. In such parts of Malaysia as have become European\r\npossessions, they are farm laborers, and in this employment they have no\r\nsuperiors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Malay boy]\r\n\r\nOf all the native peoples of Oceania, the Polynesians are perhaps the\r\nmost interesting. In physical appearance they are tall, well-formed,\r\ndark of complexion, and black-haired. In the northern island\r\ngroups--Tonga, Hawaii, Samoa, Tahiti, and others--which are colonized by\r\nEuropean and American peoples, the natives have gradually acquired\r\nwestern civilization. The number of natives has decreased, however, and\r\nonly about one-third of the population of fifty years ago remains\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\nThe animal and vegetable life is peculiar. That of Australia resembles\r\nthe life forms of a geological age long since past; that of the islands\r\nnear tropical Asia is Asian in character. Now there are many large\r\nislands at a considerable distance from the continent in which many of\r\nthe life forms on the slopes facing Australia are Australian, while on\r\nthe northerly and westerly slopes they are Asian. One cannot be certain,\r\nhowever, that these islands were ever a part of the Australian\r\ncontinent, or that they were ever joined to Asia. On the contrary it is\r\nmore probable that the life in question was carried by winds and\r\ncurrents of the sea.\r\n\r\nThe life forms of the coral atolls are very few in number. So far as\r\nvegetation is concerned, the cocoa-palm and breadfruit are about the\r\nonly kinds of plant life of importance. A few species of fish and\r\nmigratory birds are the only animals that may be used as food.\r\n\r\nThe names given to the various divisions of Oceania are more or less\r\nfanciful. Australasia means Southern Asia; Malaysia, Malayan Asia;\r\nMelanesia, the islands of the blacks; Micronesia, small islands; and\r\nPolynesia, many islands.\r\n\r\nDuring the latter half of the nineteenth century practically all of\r\nOceania has been divided among European powers. Australia, Tasmania, and\r\nNew Zealand are peopled by colonists from England; but they possess the\r\ncharacter of a great nation rather than that of colonies. A few of the\r\nlarger islands have become producers of sugar, cotton, and fruit. The\r\nlong distance from the markets for their products is offset by the low\r\ncost of native labor. The coral islands are almost valueless for\r\ncommercial products; but a few of them are used as coaling stations,\r\ntelegraphic cable stations, or as positions of naval advantage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nAUSTRALIA\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly in the sixteenth century the island of Australia became known to\r\nthe Portuguese; later the Dutch, who had valuable possessions in the\r\nEast Indies, sent exploring expeditions to spy out the new land, and\r\nnamed it New Holland. But not until after Captain Cook, of the English\r\nnavy, had explored the eastern part did any one think the country to be\r\nmore than a barren waste sparsely inhabited by savages. Indeed, various\r\nEuropean nations who were even then seeking lands for colonization\r\nthought it too worthless to claim.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1770, Captain Cook made his first landing on the east coast\r\nand, finding at one place a profusion of beautiful flowers, named the\r\nindentation Botany Bay. He spent a considerable time in exploring the\r\neastern coast and also the Great Barrier Reef. In going through one of\r\nthe passages across the Barrier Reef his vessel ran aground, and in\r\norder to lighten it he was obliged to throw overboard six of his\r\nheaviest cannon. In late years efforts have been made to secure these\r\ncannon as souvenirs, but the search for them has proved unavailing. One\r\nmay easily imagine that they have been long since entombed in thick\r\ngrowths of coral.\r\n\r\nOn his return home, Cook gave such a glowing account of the great island\r\nthat the English Government forthwith sent out a body of soldiers to\r\ntake possession of the country and to make settlements. Because it is\r\nwell watered, the southeastern part was selected as best adapted for\r\ncolonization. For a long time this part of Australia was utilized\r\nchiefly as a penal colony, but the fruitful land and salubrious climate\r\nquickly attracted free emigrants from England. Then gold was discovered,\r\nand thousands of people rushed to the new Eldorado, not only from Great\r\nBritain but from all parts of the world. Almost in a twinkling it\r\nchanged from \"our remotest colony\" to a great country producing annually\r\nmillions of wealth.\r\n\r\nSo far as its surface features are concerned, one may regard Australia\r\nas a continent not quite so large as the United States. The eastern part\r\nis diversified by low ranges of mountains fantastically scored and\r\ncarved by rivers which are swift and impassable torrents during the\r\nseason of rains, and trickling streams, or dry washes, the rest of the\r\nyear. This is the region that has produced a wealth of gold and wool and\r\na stock of hardy people that for intelligence and strength of character\r\ncan scarcely be matched elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe central part of the continent is a dish-shaped table-land. Its\r\nsurface is sandy here, stony there, but intensely hot and desolate\r\neverywhere--desolate of everything that adds to the comfort of man, but\r\nfull of about everything that contributes to his misery. The \"bush\"\r\nwhich covers so much of this region is chiefly acacia, and the acacia is\r\nchiefly thorns. The rivers that flow into the interior from the coast\r\nhighlands seem at first sight to be formidable streams so far as\r\nappearance goes. One, the Murray, is more than a thousand miles in\r\nlength. But even the Murray will match the description which an English\r\ntraveller gave to Platte River--\"A mile wide, an inch deep, and bottom\r\non top!\"\r\n\r\nThe few lakes of the interior are great \"sinks,\" or marshes, much like\r\nHumboldt Sink, in Nevada. They are shallow, reed-grown, and briny, and\r\nthey are bordered by mud flats and quicksands between which there is\r\nlittle to choose. An unfortunate victim will sink in the one quite as\r\nquickly as in the other. But even the lakes are gradually going the way\r\nof all lakes. In this case, however, their disappearance is due largely\r\nto the dust storms that little by little are burying them.\r\n\r\nOnly a very small part of the central region can be reclaimed; for where\r\nthere is so little rain there can be but little either of surface or of\r\nground waters. During the intensely hot summer season the smaller\r\nstreams disappear entirely and the larger ones become a succession of\r\nstagnant pools along the dry washes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A giant fig-tree, 140 feet in circumference]\r\n\r\nThe eastern part of the continent, on account of its greater extent of\r\ncoast, is far richer in resources than the central section. It contains\r\nnot only a greater proportion of land fit for grazing and cultivation,\r\nbut also very rich mines. Perhaps these have not a greater wealth of\r\nminerals than the mines of the central section, but they are so situated\r\nthat they can be more easily worked.\r\n\r\nThe great island of Tasmania ought also to be included in the Australian\r\ncontinent; for it is separated from it by a narrow and not very deep\r\nstrait. In its general features Tasmania resembles eastern Australia;\r\nand, indeed, it is one of the most productive and delightful parts of\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nOf the whole Australian continent scarcely one part in fourteen is fit\r\nfor human habitation, not because the soil is lacking in elements of\r\nfertility but because there is not enough rainfall. As a matter of fact,\r\nthe rain-bearing winds bring rain only to the eastern and southeastern\r\npart of the continent. Any map will show that nearly all the cities,\r\ntowns, herding-grounds, and settlements are in that part of the\r\ncontinent, and they are there because the rainfall is there.\r\n\r\nThe rest of Australia is like the Sahara in one respect; it is a desert.\r\nBeyond that fact the resemblance between the two ceases; indeed, they\r\ncould scarcely be more unlike; for, while the Sahara is much like any\r\nother desert, Australia is unlike any other part of the world.\r\n\r\nNot very much is known about the interior because but few explorers have\r\nbeen able to penetrate the continent. Many have tried to explore its\r\nfastnesses, it is true, and many bones are bleaching in its furnace-like\r\ndesert. Even a century after the eastern part had become dotted with\r\nsettlements the interior was so little known that the government of\r\nSouth Australia offered a reward of ten thousand pounds to any one who\r\nwould start from Adelaide and cross the island due north. Now, ten\r\nthousand pounds, or fifty thousand dollars, is a large sum of money,\r\nand there were many efforts to obtain it.\r\n\r\nIn 1860 an explorer named Stuart, whose name is remembered in a high\r\npeak which he discovered, traversed more than half the distance. It was\r\na record trip, but illness forced Stuart to turn back. Another\r\nexpedition, headed by four plucky men, Burke, Wills, Grery, and King,\r\nwere more lucky on their outward trip. They reached tide-water near the\r\nhead of the Gulf of Carpenteria, thereby accomplishing the task. The\r\nreturn trip was tragic. When they had reached the relief depot at which\r\nthey had planned to have supplies awaiting them, they found nothing.\r\nThey wandered about until all but King died from exposure and\r\nstarvation. A year or two later Stuart made a third attempt and found\r\nwhat is now an \"overland route,\" for a telegraph line has been built\r\nalong it from Adelaide to the north coast, and this connects with an\r\nocean cable to London.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A mother kangaroo with a young kangaroo in her pocket]\r\n\r\nThe plant and animal life of Australia forms one of its most remarkable\r\nfeatures. Both plants and animals are of the kind that lived many ages\r\nago. One of the curiosities of forest life is the \"gum,\" or eucalyptus,\r\na belt of which almost surrounds the continent. In its native home the\r\nblue gum is a most beautiful tree that sometimes grows to a height of\r\nthree hundred feet. When the tree begins its growth the stem is nearly\r\nsquare in shape and the leaves are almost circular. After a short time,\r\nhowever, the branches and trunk become circular and the leaves long and\r\nlance-shaped. They hang with their edges instead of their flat surfaces\r\nto the light, which also is true of many other Australian trees. The\r\neucalyptus sheds--not its leaves every year, but its bark instead.\r\n\r\nMany plants which in other continents are small shrubs in Australia are\r\ntrees. The tulip, the fern, the honeysuckle, and the lily are examples.\r\nThey all grow in tree form and are of considerable size. There is no\r\nturf grass except that which is cultivated. The wild grasses are of the\r\n\"bunch\" or clump species, and some of these have blades so sharp that\r\nthey cut cruelly. One species, the porcupine grass, bears a name that\r\ndoes not belie its character. Much of the coast lands are covered with a\r\ngrowth of thorny \"scrub\" that has made cultivation both difficult and\r\ncostly. The interior is the \"bush\" region.\r\n\r\nThe animal life of the continent is even more singular than the plant\r\nlife. Most of the animals resemble the opossum of North American fauna\r\nin one respect, the mother carries her young in a pouch or fold of the\r\nskin under her body. But the opossum itself is not confined to North\r\nAmerica alone; there are several species in Australia and Tasmania. The\r\nkangaroos are among the most remarkable animals, not only because of the\r\ngreat length and strength of their hind legs, but also because of the\r\nvariety in the sizes of the different species. Some of the smaller\r\nspecies are no larger than a small rat; the large-sized species are six\r\nfeet tall when sitting on their haunches.\r\n\r\nThere are no monkeys and no animals that chew the cud, but there is a\r\nwonderful variety of birds. Among them is the emeu, a kind of ostrich\r\nthat practically is wingless. Another, the platypus, or duck-bill, has\r\nthe bill and webbed feet of a duck and the body and tail of a beaver.\r\nStranger still, the female duck-bill lays eggs, but nurses her young\r\nafter the eggs are hatched! The duck-bill carries a hinged spur on the\r\nhind legs, which also is a sting that injects a violent poison into\r\nwhatever it strikes. Ordinarily the spur is folded against the leg of\r\nthe animal, but when used as a weapon it stands out like the gaff of a\r\nfighting cock. The duck-bill may well boast of its sting, because the\r\nhoney-bee of Australia has none.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: An Australian emeu]\r\n\r\nThe dingo, or wild dog, may not be an especially interesting animal to\r\nthe student of natural history, but it is a very interesting one to the\r\nherdsman. For of all animals in Australia the dingo is the most\r\nintolerable nuisance on account of its fondness for mutton. Hunting the\r\ncoyote on the plains of the United States is a pastime, but hunting the\r\nAustralian dingo is a serious and monotonous business. Indeed, the sheep\r\nand the dingo cannot both remain in Australia unless the former has been\r\neaten by the latter. In a single night a dingo will kill a score of\r\nsheep, and a pack of them will make way with several hundred. In one\r\ninstance two of these pests killed and maimed more than four hundred\r\nsheep before retribution overtook them.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the troubles of native origin, three very serious pests\r\nhave been imported. One of these, the species of cactus known as the\r\nprickly pear, the Queenslander has pretty nearly all to himself. Just\r\nhow the prickly pear was introduced into Australia seems to be a matter\r\nof uncertainty. But it is there and it is spreading rapidly. Each plant\r\nproduces scores of pears and each pear contains not far from one hundred\r\nseeds. When the fruit ripens the seeds are quickly sent broadcast.\r\nPerhaps the wind is the chief agent in scattering them, but wild birds,\r\nespecially the emeu and the turkey, are a good second. Queenslanders\r\nfear that this pernicious plant will spread not only over the great\r\ninterior desert sections, but to the valuable land elsewhere, since it\r\nis tenacious of life and thrives on arid land amidst a burning heat\r\nwhere other plants wither up and perish.\r\n\r\nIn clearing the land of the cactus three methods are utilized, viz.,\r\nburning, pitting, and poisoning. Where wood is near at hand, the first\r\nmethod is the preferable one. A platform is made by rolling logs\r\ntogether, and after the plants have been uprooted and hacked to pieces\r\nthey are hauled in drays to the platforms. There they are stacked up\r\nhigh, sometimes a hundred tons being piled on a single platform, and the\r\nplatforms are set afire. Pitting is done by digging large, deep pits,\r\nfilling them full of the chopped plants, and covering them with dirt.\r\nDestruction by poisoning is accomplished by inoculating the thick leaves\r\nwith arsenic or bluestone, which is sprayed upon them after the plants\r\nhave been hacked so that the poison may be absorbed by the sap, which\r\ndistributes the deadly substance.\r\n\r\nYears ago some of the colonists thought that it would be desirable to\r\nhave English rabbits in Australia and sent to England for a few pairs.\r\nWhen the rabbits arrived a great feast was held, and amidst speeches and\r\nmutual congratulations the timid creatures were let loose. In a short\r\ntime rabbits seemed quite plentiful and the hunters had rare sport; but\r\nere long the animals began to eat up the vegetables in the gardens.\r\n\r\nNow, rabbits are very prolific, and within a very few years they had\r\nspread so extensively that the sheepmen began to complain of their\r\nserious inroads on herbage and grass where the sheep fed. At this stage\r\nof affairs legislation was invoked in behalf of the suffering farmers.\r\nLaws were passed and means taken to reduce the number of rabbits.\r\nPoisoned grain and other food was used, but still the rabbits greatly\r\nincreased. The dingo was tamed and used for hunting them, and then the\r\nmongoose was imported from India to kill them off.\r\n\r\nBut the rabbits seemed to have increased a thousand-fold. In despair,\r\nrabbit commissioners were appointed in each colony to enforce the\r\nbuilding of high rabbit-proof wire fences, and now thousands of miles of\r\nwire fences have been built so as to enclose ranges and farms. By means\r\nof the fences and by the use of various methods of destroying the pests,\r\nthey are now kept in check after causing millions of dollars of damage,\r\nand at an enormous annual expense to the colonists. In the meantime it\r\nwas discovered that the flesh of the rabbit was excellent food, and the\r\nslaughter of millions to be preserved has been a noticeable check to\r\ntheir increase.\r\n\r\nUnlike the American Indians, the aboriginal peoples of Australia were\r\nnever troublesome to the European settlers, and although apt to be\r\nthievish they were not inclined to warlike acts when the European\r\nsettlements were new. The \"bushrangers,\" as they are called, somewhat\r\nresemble the negro peoples, and are thought to be a part of the black\r\nrace that is found in the island near New Guinea. They are classed as\r\nNegroids, or Negritos, and they bear a considerable resemblance to the\r\nAfrican pygmies, with whom at least one authority classes them. They are\r\nmaterially larger and taller than the pygmies, however, though below the\r\naverage stature of Europeans. At all events they are among the lowest\r\ntype of human beings.\r\n\r\nThe bushrangers have no fixed habitation; they do not build houses nor\r\nlive in villages; they have no domestic animals except the dingo, and\r\nthey do not cultivate the soil. They live nominally by hunting and\r\nfishing, but their food consists of about anything that requires no\r\nweapons beyond the fish-net and the boomerang. They rarely molest larger\r\ngame, though some of the tribes employ a net in which to entrap the\r\nkangaroo.\r\n\r\nOf all the weapons used by savage tribes the boomerang is the most\r\ninteresting. In shape it is a flat strip of hardwood having an angle, or\r\nelse slightly curved in the middle. The interesting feature about it is\r\nthe fact that when skilfully thrown it will return to the thrower unless\r\nintercepted. A bushranger may be skilful enough to throw the boomerang\r\nahead of him so that in its return it will kill a small animal back of\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe bushrangers were only too ready to adopt the vices of Europeans, but\r\nthey have not been able to withstand the changes wrought by\r\ncivilization. Their numbers have steadily diminished. In 1880 they were\r\nthought to be about eighty thousand in number, but at the close of the\r\ncentury there were scarcely one-fourth as many. Those who remain are for\r\nthe greater part herdsmen and farm laborers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Homestead and station in Young district, Australia]\r\n\r\nOne may not be very far from right in saying that the climate of the\r\nhabitable part of the continent is the foremost asset of Australia.\r\nCertain it is that for healthfulness and the stimulation that creates\r\nactivity, the climate of Australia is unsurpassed elsewhere in the\r\nworld. And because of its life-growing and invigorating character it has\r\nplaced the Australian high in the rank of the world's foremost people.\r\n\r\nClimate and soil, too, have made Australia one of the foremost\r\nwool-producing countries of the world. Not far from one hundred million\r\ndollars' worth of wool and mutton are exported yearly, and much of the\r\nwool clip is a fine grade of merino. Gold is another product of\r\nAustralia. At the close of the century the mines had produced a total of\r\nmore than one billion dollars' worth of the metal. In round figures, the\r\ngreat Thirst Land, with a population of about four millions, scattered\r\nalong the edge of a great desert continent, produces enough wealth to\r\nsell yearly about three hundred millions of dollars' worth of its\r\nproducts!\r\n\r\nThe foregoing picture of Australia presents, perhaps, the unpleasant\r\nside of Australian life. But this great Thirst Land, so far from being\r\nan inhospitable desert, is one of the world's greatest storehouses of\r\nwealth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT BARRIER REEF\r\n\r\n\r\nWithin the tropical parts of the great South Sea are submarine gardens\r\nthat in the beauty of their floral forms and their richness of coloring\r\nrival the most elaborate flowerbeds made by man; in color and variety\r\nthey are fairy regions of exquisite living animal flowers. One of the\r\ngreatest and most attractive of these sea gardens lies off the coast of\r\nAustralia.\r\n\r\nOf all the wonderful animal structures in the world the Great Barrier\r\nReef of Australia is the most remarkable. It consists of a chain of\r\ncoral islands and reefs parallel to the east coast of Queensland. This\r\ngreat reef is about twelve hundred miles long, and the distance from the\r\nmainland to its outer border is from ten to more than one hundred miles.\r\nIt is far enough off the coast to leave a wide channel between the reef\r\nand the shore.\r\n\r\nSince it is well charted this channel is the route taken by many\r\nvessels. It is admirably furnished with lighthouses and light-ships, and\r\nis protected from the huge rolling billows of the ocean by the reef\r\nitself. There are several breaks in the reef through which vessels can\r\npass out into the open ocean.\r\n\r\nThis mighty barrier, the work of coral polyps, is of special interest\r\nnot only on account of the curious shapes and varied kinds of sea life\r\nit presents, but because of the commercial value of its products. The\r\nbêche-de-mer, pearl, oyster, and sponge fisheries yield an annual\r\nrevenue of upward of half a million dollars, and when all of the\r\nresources of the reef are properly exploited the returns will be more\r\nthan doubled.\r\n\r\nThe habitat of the reef-building coral is in clear tropical waters. The\r\npolyps thrive best near the surface; they cannot live at a depth\r\nexceeding one hundred and twenty-five feet. The reef-building coral must\r\nnot be confounded with the precious, or red, coral, which flourishes in\r\na muddy sea-bottom and is found chiefly in the Mediterranean Sea.\r\n\r\nWhen alive and in the water, coral polyps present a variety of beautiful\r\nforms and colors. Living polyps are composed of limestone skeletons\r\ncovering and permeating a soft gelatinous substance which corresponds to\r\nthe flesh of animals. When the polyps are removed from the water this\r\nsoon decomposes and disappears; in certain species a part of it flows\r\noff as a thick liquid.\r\n\r\nFish fantastically striped and of brilliantly variegated colors are seen\r\nswimming among the coral. In tropical waters many of them have\r\nfascinating colors and patterns. By simulating the colors of the coral\r\npolyps they escape the species that prey upon them.\r\n\r\nThe different kinds of coral are generally designated by common names\r\naccording to the different objects which they resemble. Thus, by\r\nsimilarity of form we have _brain_ coral, _organ-pipe_ coral, _mushroom_\r\ncoral, _staghorn_ coral, etc.\r\n\r\nSome of the islands and reefs are the homes of sea fowl and at the\r\nnesting season are literally covered with their eggs. These fishers of\r\nthe sea have marvellously well-developed faculties for location, since\r\neach bird goes directly to her nest when returning to the islands. As\r\nnight approaches, when all the birds seek the land, their wild cries are\r\ndeafening.\r\n\r\nSome of the islands are turned to profitable account by the export of\r\nguano. On Raine Island, so extensive are the deposits of guano that a\r\nrailroad has been built to facilitate handling the product.\r\n\r\nBêche-de-mer, or trepang, is a name applied to the flesh of certain sea\r\nslugs or sea worms found in the Indian seas. Of this substance great\r\nquantities are gathered annually. In the water the animals resemble huge\r\ncucumbers, and they are therefore sometimes called \"sea-cucumbers.\" They\r\nare found clinging to the rocks below low-water mark, and are from one\r\nto four feet in length. Their food consists of microscopic shell-fish\r\nwhich live upon the coral rocks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Great Barrier Reef of Australia, the most remarkable\r\nanimal structure in the world]\r\n\r\nThe trepang exported from this section requires considerable care in\r\npreparation. After being gathered from the rocks they are cleaned,\r\nboiled, and partly dried in the air; then they are smoked with mangrove\r\nwood until dry and hard. The best class of trepang is packed in tin\r\ncases to keep it perfectly dry, as moisture ruins it. The product is\r\nmarketed chiefly at Hongkong, where it is used in making the gelatinous\r\nsoups for which the Chinese are so famous.\r\n\r\nThe pearl-shell fisheries yield products of considerable value. The\r\naverage depth from which the mother-of-pearl shell is gathered is seven\r\nor eight fathoms. Twenty fathoms represents the greatest depth in which\r\ndivers, even in their diving suits, can work, so great is the pressure\r\nof the water upon them.\r\n\r\nThe fishery is carried on chiefly for securing the shells, the finding\r\nof pearls being of secondary importance, since only about one shell in a\r\nthousand contains a pearl of much value. The shells themselves bring in\r\nthe market from three hundred to eight hundred dollars per ton according\r\nto quality and size, and are used chiefly for making buttons and small\r\nornaments.\r\n\r\nThe Cairn Cross Islands, a little coral group midway between Cape\r\nGrenville and Cape York, are especially interesting as the home and\r\nnesting-place of the Torres Strait pigeons. These large white pigeons\r\nare highly esteemed for the table. They gather at the islands during the\r\nmonth of October and remain until the end of March. The nests are\r\nusually built in the forked branches of the mangrove trees that form\r\nextensive thickets along the coast. Each nest contains two white eggs.\r\n\r\nThe Australian jungle-fowl or scrub-hen also frequents these islands as\r\nwell as the mainland. The nests of these birds are large and unique.\r\nThey consist of huge mounds of dead leaves, grass, sticks, and soft\r\nearth piled together by the adult birds in shaded and sequestered\r\nplaces. The mounds are about twenty feet in diameter and from ten to\r\nfifteen feet high. Several pairs of birds generally unite in their\r\nconstruction.\r\n\r\nWhen the mounds are completed the birds burrow holes in the centre and\r\ndeposit their eggs, which are left to be hatched by the moist heat\r\nengendered by the decaying vegetation. Forty or fifty brick-red colored\r\neggs as large as those of a turkey are sometimes found in a single nest.\r\nBoth the eggs and the parent birds are excellent eating.\r\n\r\nThe Australian bee-eater, a bird of attractive plumage, is found all\r\nover the northern islets of the Barrier Reef. It has a long, sharp\r\ncurved bill and two long, narrow feathers in its tail. Its beautiful\r\ngreen plumage, varied with rich brown and black, and vivid blue on the\r\nthroat, makes it an attractive bird.\r\n\r\nThe sea-anemones of the Great Barrier Reef are remarkable for both\r\nbeauty of color and structure; some of them measure four or five inches\r\nacross the expanded disk. In Torres Strait are seen brilliant\r\nsea-anemones around the border of whose disks are jewel-like clusters.\r\nThese beautiful sea animals present the appearance of delicately tinted\r\nflowers adorned with the most exquisite gems.\r\n\r\nStarfish and sea-urchins of all descriptions are found in immense\r\nnumbers. The five-rayed varieties of starfish are universally condemned\r\nas insatiable foes of the oyster family, and the oyster cultivators\r\ndestroy all they can find. To dismember the body of the starfish by\r\npulling off the finger-like rays does not kill the animal, for not only\r\ndoes each fish produce new rays but each ray will produce a new\r\nstarfish. The predatory starfish fastens itself to both valves of the\r\noyster, forces them open, and consumes the fleshy part. It is\r\ndestructive not only to oysters but to clams, mussels, barnacles,\r\nsnails, worms, and small crustacea as well.\r\n\r\nThe variety of sea life about the great reef is legion. Among the\r\nbivalves the most remarkable for the size and weight of the shells are\r\nthe tridachna and hippopus. In some localities they are so numerous that\r\ntheir shells have been burned to make lime. A pair of tridachna valves\r\noften weighs several hundred pounds.\r\n\r\nTo the naturalist the Great Barrier Reef is an object of special\r\nattraction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nTHE GOLD FIELDS OF AUSTRALIA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe name Australia, like that of California, conjures up in the mind\r\nvisions of gold; and the story of the gold excitement in both is very\r\nsimilar. January 24, 1848, was the red-letter day in California's\r\nhistory, and the news that transpired that day electrified the world.\r\nWhile constructing a saw-mill at Coloma Creek, a branch of the American\r\nRiver, John Marshall picked up a handful of gold nuggets in the\r\nmill-race. At once the gold fever seized all far and near. During the\r\nensuing year fifty thousand persons came by sea and by land from the\r\nStates east of the Rocky Mountains, and forty thousand more from other\r\nparts of the world; all bent upon digging for gold in the new El Dorado.\r\n\r\nFrom far-off Australia came vessels crowded with passengers. Among these\r\nwas Edward H. Hargraves, who had lived for twenty years in New South\r\nWales, where fortune had not smiled on him. Hargraves was a keen\r\nobserver and something of a geologist as well. He diligently scoured the\r\ngullies and canyons in the gold regions of California, and when he quit\r\nhe possessed a good sum of money as a return for his labor. During his\r\nstay in California he became convinced that gold existed in Australia,\r\nsince many of the formations and strata were similar to those of the\r\ngold-bearing fields of California.\r\n\r\nAfter working for nearly two years, he planned to return to his old\r\nhome, implicitly believing that he could win riches and fame by\r\ndiscoveries of the precious metal in New South Wales; and as soon as he\r\nhad landed at Sydney he made ready to test his theories. When he\r\nexplained to his friends what he purposed to do and his reasons they\r\nconsidered him half crazy. Moreover, rumors that convict shepherds had\r\nsold gold nuggets to traders in Sydney strengthened his belief that gold\r\nin paying quantities could be obtained by seeking for it. There were\r\nrumors also that a gold nugget had been picked up on Fish River.\r\n\r\nProcuring a team he set forth on his journey for the Blue Mountains\r\nlying back of Sydney. On the fourth day out, stopping at an inn kept by\r\na widow, he confided to her his mission and enlisted her co-operation.\r\nHe requested a black boy for a guide; but instead she sent her son, who\r\nwas well acquainted with every inch of the region for miles around.\r\n\r\nTaking horses, Hargraves and the young man started out from the inn. It\r\nwas a crisp autumn morning succeeding a dry summer. A careful search was\r\nmade up and down canyons and gulches. At length, during the latter part\r\nof the day, they reached the bank of a dry creek which disclosed strata\r\nsimilar to the auriferous gravels of California.\r\n\r\nLooking about, Hargraves found a spot in the bed of the creek from\r\nwhich, after scooping off the top, he scraped from the bedrock a panful\r\nof earth. Hastening to the water hole with the loaded pan, he proceeded\r\nto wash away the soil and lo, in the bottom of the pan were\r\nbright-yellow particles!\r\n\r\n\"I shall be made a baronet and both of us will be rich,\" exclaimed the\r\nexcited Hargraves. He seemed to be walking upon air and could scarcely\r\nbelieve his own senses. Nevertheless, he prudently kept his own counsel\r\nuntil he had taken out sixty thousand dollars. Then he hastened to\r\nSydney to lay the matter before the government. The government gave him\r\na reward of fifty thousand dollars for his discoveries and made him\r\ncommissioner of the gold fields.\r\n\r\nHargraves's unexpected find stimulated other persons to search elsewhere\r\nfor the attractive metal, and soon other and far richer fields were\r\nfound. From one locality alone seven tons of gold were obtained in a\r\nsingle month.\r\n\r\nThe whole country now went gold mad. Doctors left their patients,\r\nlawyers their offices, bakers and butchers their shops, clerks the\r\nstores, and sailors deserted their ships as soon as they touched the\r\nwharves--everybody hastened to the diggings eager to get rich.\r\n\r\nWhen confirmation of the wonderful gold deposits in Australia reached\r\nthe outside world, a grand rush, like that to California, took place.\r\nNew towns and cities sprang up as by magic, and from the increase of\r\nbusiness the older places rapidly became more populous. Since the time\r\nof Hargraves's discovery, Victoria has produced the most gold, some of\r\nthe largest nuggets in the world having been found in this colony.\r\n\r\nThe following story of the gold fields is related in Lang's \"Australia\":\r\nWhile the ship _Dudbrook_ was docked at Sydney, where she was receiving\r\nher cargo, a sailor boy named Bob heard of the great quantities of gold\r\nthat had been dug out of the mountains. He longed to try his luck at\r\nmining, but hardly knew how he could get away from the ship without\r\nbeing caught.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, while the ship was receiving her cargo, all the old\r\ncrew except Bob had deserted. He hesitated about leaving and seemed to\r\nfind no good opportunity to escape unnoticed. The day of departure\r\narrived. The sails were being shaken out by the new crew, which had been\r\npressed into service. The little tug that was to tow the big ship out\r\nof the harbor was beginning to straighten the cable and churn the water\r\ninto foam, but the hawser still held the vessel fast to the wharf. The\r\ncaptain shouted \"Bob, Bob, get ashore and cast off the hawser.\"\r\n\r\nBob now saw the long-waited-for opportunity and with alacrity sprang to\r\nthe wharf, but not to release the hawser. He ran along, hidden by the\r\njetty, until he reached the shore and then dodged into a house where he\r\nhad friends. The skipper could not stop to hunt up the runaway, so the\r\nvessel was towed out through the Heads and sailed for Newcastle to pick\r\nup a cargo for India.\r\n\r\nThe next day Bob started on foot for the mines and, while on his way,\r\npicked up one of his old shipmates with whom he formed a partnership. On\r\narriving at the diggings, the two staked out a claim and began sinking a\r\nshaft; but after reaching the bottom no metal greeted their longing\r\neyes. Another shaft was sunk and this time they struck it rich.\r\n\r\nWithin two months each had saved up one hundred twenty pounds of gold.\r\nLike some of his companions, Bob now concluded to take a short rest and\r\ngo to Sydney for a few days of pleasure. Therefore he changed his gold\r\ninto pound notes, and, stuffing the big rolls into his trousers'\r\npockets, started for the city.\r\n\r\nBeing of an economical turn of mind, he concluded to walk, and taking an\r\nearly start, by the middle of the afternoon he had measured off\r\ntwenty-five miles. The day was hot and the roads dusty; and seeing a\r\nshady nook, near a creek not far from the roadside, he betook himself\r\nthither and sat down to wait for a bullock wagon which he had passed two\r\nhours before. The water in the stream looked cool and inviting, so he\r\nundressed to take a swim.\r\n\r\nIn taking off his clothes he pulled out of his pockets the two bundles\r\nof pound notes and laid them beside his boots. After being in the water\r\nfor some time, he came out; and looking where he had laid the notes,\r\ncould see them nowhere. Who could have taken them? He saw no one around\r\nwhen he undressed, and he had seen no one about while he was bathing.\r\nPossibly the thief was hiding behind some of the trees near by. Without\r\nwaiting to dress, he searched here and there behind trees and logs, but\r\nthere was no sign of the thief.\r\n\r\nHe was greatly disheartened at his loss, but, putting on his clothes, he\r\ncame across a ten-pound note which he had concealed in a side pocket.\r\nThis find cheered him up and he resolved to go down to the city\r\nnotwithstanding his loss. The bullock team soon came along and Bob told\r\nthe driver what had happened. They both searched the ground over to\r\nsolve the disappearance of the money, but in vain.\r\n\r\nWhen Bob reached Sydney, like other sailors, he visited several barrooms\r\nwhere he told the story of his strange loss. In one of the places, in a\r\ncorner, sat an old Scotch crone, smoking her pipe and quietly listening\r\nto the conversation. At midnight when Bob was about to leave, the old\r\nwoman said, \"What will ye gie me if I find yer money for ye?\"\r\n\r\n\"What will I give ye, mother?\" cried Bob. \"Why, I'll give ye a silk\r\ndress and a ten-pound note.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a bargain!\" she cried; and then she told him what to do.\r\n\r\nHe was to be ready at four the next morning with a horse and trap which\r\nhe could obtain from the landlord. If he would take along an axe, a roll\r\nof string, and a newspaper, she would find his money for him, she said.\r\n\r\nThough much in doubt about the power of such articles to find his money,\r\nBob did as old Maggie had directed, and sharply at four in the morning\r\nthe two started back to his bathing place. It took but a short time to\r\ndrive back ten miles to the creek and the hollow log on which Bob sat\r\nwhen he pulled off his boots.\r\n\r\n\"Now, show me the place where ye put the money down,\" said Maggie.\r\n\r\nAfter carefully looking around she seemed to be satisfied with the\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\n\"Now, gie me the paper and the twine,\" she said. Taking a portion of the\r\npaper and tying it with a long piece of twine she laid it down just\r\nwhere the notes had been placed. Then Maggie said, \"Let us seek a shady\r\nplace a short distance away and I'll play ye at cribbage.\" Bob took\r\nlittle stock in these seemingly foolish arrangements; nevertheless he\r\ndetermined to be game to the end.\r\n\r\nShe led the way to a cool place on the creek bank a hundred yards\r\ndistant where they sat down. She then drew out of her pocket a dirty\r\npack of cards and a bar of soap punched with holes to be used as a\r\ncribbage board.\r\n\r\nTwo games were leisurely played, both of which Maggie won. \"Now,\" said\r\nshe, \"Come wi' me.\" She hobbled back to where the paper tied with a\r\nstring had been left. No paper was in sight, but hanging out of the\r\nhollow log where Bob had removed his boots was the end of the string.\r\nMaggie chuckled, and pointing to the log, cried, \"Now rip it up wi' the\r\naxe.\"\r\n\r\nBob set to work with a will and soon had a big hole chopped out of the\r\nhollow log, and behold! there were the bank-notes and the newspaper,\r\nforming a cozy nest for some little speckled native cats calling for\r\ntheir breakfast, while farther in were seen two bright balls of fire,\r\nthe mother cat's eyes. The mother cat had run off with Bob's money to\r\nmake a nest for her young ones.\r\n\r\nMaggie accepted the ten-pound note but refused the silk dress, telling\r\nthe lad that she had no use for such finery.\r\n\r\nSoon after the English settled in Australia they introduced merino\r\nsheep, and during the last quarter of a century the breed has been\r\nconstantly improved.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that now there are not less than seventy-five million\r\nsheep in Australia. The two great drawbacks to this thriving industry\r\nare drought and disease. Some years, owing to the scanty rainfall,\r\nmillions of sheep have starved for lack of food.\r\n\r\nTwo seasons prevail, the dry and the rainy, the climatic conditions\r\nbeing similar to those of California.\r\n\r\nThe eastern section of this continental island is the only part that is\r\nadapted both to grazing and to agriculture. New South Wales outranks all\r\nthe other Australian colonies in sheep raising, and Queensland in cattle\r\nraising.\r\n\r\nAlmost the entire eastern shore section is well adapted to the\r\nproduction of lemons, oranges, and figs, while in the southeastern part\r\nall kinds of temperate-zone fruits flourish. The production of wheat\r\nalso deserves important attention.\r\n\r\nThe development of cold-storage transportation has given a great impetus\r\nto the exportation of frozen mutton and beef to England.\r\n\r\nMelbourne, the capital of Victoria, situated on Port Philip Bay, near\r\nthe mouth of the Yarra River, is the largest city of Australia and\r\ncontains nearly half a million people. It is built chiefly upon two\r\nhills and the intervening valley. The streets are broad and cross each\r\nother at right angles. Many of the squares are devoted to public parks\r\nand gardens. There are splendid public and private buildings, including\r\nan excellent library and an art gallery, both of which are free to all.\r\nAlthough less than sixty years old, this young city will compare\r\nfavorably in regard to its buildings and general management with the\r\nlargest cities in both Europe and America.\r\n\r\nThe oldest city in Australia, Sydney, is the capital of New South Wales\r\nand has a population of four hundred thousand. It is situated on Port\r\nJackson and is said to have the finest harbor in the world. This is a\r\ncompletely landlocked sheet of deep water which can be entered only\r\nthrough a narrow passage, thus affording protection to the shipping,\r\neven during the most violent storms, and so large that it could\r\naccommodate all of the fleets that sail the ocean and have room to\r\nspare.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Melbourne is the largest city of Australia and contains\r\nnearly half a million people]\r\n\r\nOf Australia's thirteen thousand miles of railways all but five hundred\r\nmiles belong to the colonial government, and are administered in the\r\ninterests of the people. So low are the freight and passenger rates that\r\noften a tax has to be levied to meet the deficits. More than half of the\r\npublic debt is due to government ownership of the railroads.\r\n\r\nAmong other prominent places may be mentioned Brisbane, the capital of\r\nQueensland; Adelaide, the capital of South Australia; and Perth, the\r\ncapital of Western Australia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nTASMANIA\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1642 a Dutch navigator named Abel Janszoon Tasman discovered the\r\nisland which now bears his name. Tasman did not know that he had\r\ndiscovered an island, but thought that he had discovered a part of the\r\nmainland of Australia; so he named it Van Diemen's Land, in honor of his\r\npatron, Anthony Van Diemen, Governor of the Dutch East Indies.\r\n\r\nTasmania was once one vast plateau, but in time nature worked away on\r\nits broad surface; mountains and valleys were chiselled in its face,\r\nmaking it a picturesque and diversified island. It is well watered;\r\nstreams abound in every part, and many large lakes are found in the\r\ninterior. The Derwent in the south is the largest river, and vessels may\r\ngo almost to the head of its estuary.\r\n\r\nOn account of its beautiful mountain scenery, Tasmania is called the\r\nSwitzerland of Australia. Deep winding valleys, clothed with groves of\r\nferns, give added charm to its scenery. In recent years it has become a\r\nfamous summer resort for Australians, many of whom pass a portion of the\r\nhot season in its wonderful forest solitudes and secluded fern-tree\r\nvales.\r\n\r\nNo attempt to colonize Tasmania was made until 1803. In that year four\r\nhundred convicts were brought there and the vessel containing the\r\nprisoners sailed up Derwent River and landed them where the city of\r\nHobart now stands.\r\n\r\nWhen the convicts landed, they found a very dark-skinned race of natives\r\nin possession of the land. The natives were low of stature, with ugly\r\nbroad faces, flat noses, and frizzly hair. Their habits were repulsive,\r\nbut they were inoffensive. They lived chiefly on shell-fish and what\r\nthey could obtain from the sea. Occasionally they hunted the kangaroo,\r\nand unfortunately a kangaroo hunt led to their undoing.\r\n\r\nOne morning a newly-arrived commander of the convict colony saw a large\r\nnumber of natives making toward the camp. He did not know their customs\r\nand mistook a chase after a kangaroo for an attack on the camp. So he\r\nordered the soldiers to fire on the crowd, and, as a result, fifty or\r\nmore were killed.\r\n\r\nThis was bad enough, but worse was to come; for escaped convicts began\r\nto rob and murder the natives whenever they could do so. So in time\r\nthere began a bush warfare that almost exterminated the poor natives.\r\nFinally, the remnant, about two hundred, were put on a transport and\r\ncarried to Flinder Island, where they gradually decreased in number. The\r\nlast native died in 1874.\r\n\r\nIn 1853, the English government ceased to send convicts to the island,\r\nand within a few years afterward the blackest plague spot in the world\r\nbecame one of the most beautiful colonies on the face of the earth.\r\n\r\nTasmania is far enough south of the tropics to have a much greater\r\nrainfall than most of Australia, but it is not far enough to have a cold\r\nclimate. The generous rainfall covers the whole surface with green.\r\nThere are forests of eucalyptus, or \"gum tree,\" tree ferns, beech, and\r\nacacia--just about the same kinds that one finds in Australia.\r\n\r\nThe animals, too, are much the same as in Australia, and some species of\r\nthem are pouched, like the opossum. Many of them are now rarely to be\r\nfound near the settlements, but one kind is pretty certain to be found\r\nat all times and seasons--the Tasmanian devil. This ugly beast is a\r\nterror to any neighborhood. An English hunter described it by saying\r\nthat it was more bear than wildcat, and more wildcat than bear--and\r\nbear-cat it is frequently called. The tiger-wolf is another pest that\r\nmakes great havoc among herds and flocks. Still another pest, also\r\ncalled \"devil,\" has bands of black and white on its neck and shoulders,\r\na thick heavy tail, and a bulldog mouth. It is a cowardly little night\r\nprowler with a fondness for young lambs.\r\n\r\nAs was the case in Australia, the success of sheep-growing and the\r\nfinding of rich gold-mines put an end to the convict colony. Even before\r\nthe mines became profitable the ranchmen were trying to stop the sending\r\nof convicts to the island; but when the gold fields were found, it was\r\nstopped in short order.\r\n\r\nVery shortly gold-mining became the leading industry. Then tin ore was\r\nfound at Mount Bischoff. Tasmania now produces more tin than all the\r\nrest of Australasia. In addition to the tin and precious metals, there\r\nare great beds of excellent coal--enough for all the smelteries and\r\nmanufactories in the island.\r\n\r\nNext to the mines the sheep and cattle ranches bring the chief profits\r\nto Tasmania. But another industry is growing and bids fair to become\r\nmore profitable than either mining or cattle-growing. The fruit of\r\nTasmania is of the very finest quality. Moreover, when the fruit is\r\nripening in an Australasian spring and summer, all England is shivering\r\nin midwinter storms. What better business could there be than to ship\r\napples and pears fresh from the Tasmanian orchards? Those same apples\r\ncan be shipped half-way round the world and sold in England for a lower\r\nprice than the apples shipped from Buffalo to New York City!\r\n\r\nThen there are the peaches, cherries, and strawberries. They find a\r\nready market in Australia, a matter of only a few miles away. So in time\r\nTasmania is bound to be one of the great fruit-growing countries in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nWhere once the first convict colony made its camp the beautiful city of\r\nHobart stands. It is every bit an English town. The business part of the\r\ncity consists of fine, substantial buildings; most of the residences are\r\nlow-built and half hidden in gardens of roses. The school-houses are as\r\ngood as those in any American city of the same size, and the schools\r\nthemselves are equal to the best anywhere. Kindergarten, grammar school,\r\nhigh school, and university are within the reach of all who desire.\r\n\r\nIt is said that an enterprising man can go to Tasmania, make his fortune\r\nin fifteen years, and return to England rich, to spend the rest of his\r\ndays. But why should any one desire to leave such a beautiful island to\r\nspend the rest of his life in London smoke and fog?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nNEW ZEALAND\r\n\r\n\r\nBy digging at London right through the centre of the earth one would\r\nemerge about a day's ride, in an automobile car, from the capital of New\r\nZealand--if only the automobile could ride on the water. That is to say,\r\nEngland and New Zealand are almost exactly opposite each other on the\r\nearth. That is the short way, however, and the trip would be eight\r\nthousand miles. As a matter of fact, the trip by the only available\r\nroute is not far from sixteen thousand miles; for, go either east or\r\nwest as one may choose, the route from London to New Zealand is a very\r\nroundabout way, and New Zealand is Great Britain's most remote colony.\r\n\r\nWhen Tasman was cruising about the Pacific, or South Sea, he skirted the\r\ncoast of the islands. That was in 1642. About one hundred and forty\r\nyears afterward Captain Cook called at the islands and annexed them as\r\nan English possession, but the English government refused to take them.\r\nEarly in the nineteenth century missionaries brought the Bible to the\r\nnative Maoris, and at the same time lawless traders carried liquor and\r\nfirearms to those same natives. What was still worse, they kept on\r\nsupplying them with liquor and firearms until there were but a few\r\nthousand natives left.\r\n\r\nThe Maoris are the most remarkable native peoples of the Pacific. They\r\nwere not the original people of New Zealand, however, for they drove\r\naway the black race--probably like that of New Guinea--which they found\r\nthere. Like the Hawaiians and Fijians, the Maoris came from Samoa about\r\nfive centuries ago. Their traditions about their journey are clear and\r\nexact; even the names of the canoes, or barges, in which they made the\r\njourney are preserved in Maori history. First they went to Rarotonga, an\r\nisland of the Cook group; then they went to New Zealand.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Maori pa, or village]\r\n\r\nLong before white men had settled in New Zealand, the Maoris had made\r\ngreat advances toward civilization. They had become wonderful carvers in\r\nwood; they were also expert builders, weavers, and dyers. No better\r\nseamen could be found in the Pacific. War was their chief employment,\r\nhowever, and tribal wars were always going on in some parts or other of\r\nthe islands. One may compare them in progress to the tribes of New York\r\njust before the Iroquois confederacy was formed.\r\n\r\nTwo large and a small island make up the greater part of New Zealand.\r\nNorth Island is a little smaller than New York State; South Island is a\r\nlittle larger; Stewart Island is half the size of Rhode Island.\r\n\r\nAside from these, the Chatham, Auckland, and part of the Cook group--in\r\nfact, pretty nearly every outlying group that can be used for cattle and\r\nsheep growing--are included in the New Zealand colony. This industry is\r\nthe reason for the existence of New Zealand; it is the great\r\nmeat-producing market of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nThe two largest islands of New Zealand form a great plateau. Mountain\r\nranges border the edges, and fertile, well-watered lowlands are between\r\nthe ranges. The ranges and valleys, together with hundreds of lakes, are\r\nbeautiful to the eye; they could not be better for a great grazing\r\nindustry. Cook Strait, which separates the two islands, is about sixteen\r\nmiles wide at its narrowest crossing.\r\n\r\nNorth Island has several active volcanoes, and likewise one of the three\r\nfamous geyser regions in the world. There used to be the Pink-and-White\r\nTerraces also--terraces of brilliant coloring, like those of Yellowstone\r\nPark. But a few years ago Volcano Tarawera had a bad fit of eruption,\r\nand when the eruption was over, Pink-and-White Terraces were covered\r\nmany feet deep with lava and ash.\r\n\r\nMany of the higher ranges are snow-clad the year round. The New\r\nZealanders do not need to go half-way round the world to spend the\r\nsummer in Switzerland; they have a fine Switzerland at home. Indeed, the\r\nAlps of Europe are not surpassed by those of New Zealand; and as for\r\nglaciers, the great Tasman Glacier cannot be surpassed--twenty miles\r\nlong, a mile wide, and no one knows how deep. In South Island some of\r\nthe glaciers reach almost to the sea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Petrifying Geyser, New Zealand]\r\n\r\nThere is some wonderful vegetation in New Zealand and nowhere else will\r\none find a greater variety of ferns. Some of them grow in the form of\r\ntrees; some are huge vines; and still others are as fine and delicate as\r\nthe maidenhair fern. Some kinds have fine wiry tendrils that are much\r\nused for mattresses and cushions. Another plant looks so much like a\r\npalm that no one ignorant of plants would suspect that it was not a\r\npalm-tree; but as a matter of fact it is a lily.\r\n\r\nSo many of the forest trees are evergreens, and so abundant is the grass\r\nthat at all times of the year the islands are green from the mountain\r\nsummits to the sea. Of all the forest trees the kauri pine has been one\r\nof the most valuable--has been, because not many trees are left. The\r\nwood itself is about as easily worked as white pine or California\r\nredwood. What is still better, it is very tough and durable.\r\n\r\nBut the wood itself is only a part of the wealth of the kauri forests.\r\nThe bark is full of gum which, when hard, is much like amber. It makes a\r\nvery hard and glossy varnish that commands a high price because of its\r\ngood qualities. In places where old kauri forests have existed, digging\r\nkauri gum is a profitable employment. Kauri-gum mining does not require\r\nmuch capital. A sharp iron rod and a pick are about the only tools\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\nThe gatherer goes about thrusting his rod into the earth at intervals of\r\na few inches. When he \"feels\" a piece of gum with his rod he needs only\r\nto use his pick to capture it. For many years about a million dollars'\r\nworth of kauri gum was thus obtained each year. The lumps vary in size\r\nfrom that of a hen's egg to masses weighing several pounds.\r\n\r\nThere are also some strange animals in New Zealand. One curious creature\r\nis a bird without wings--the kiwi. The species is one of many similar\r\nkinds that lived in Australia and New Zealand ages ago. Their remains\r\nare found in abundance, but the kiwi is the last species now living. It\r\nhas a long, sharp bill and hair-like feathers. A full-grown bird is\r\nabout the size of a bantam fowl. One of the more beautiful birds is a\r\ndull green parrot, the kea. But the kea is also a wretched pest, for it\r\nhas learned how to kill sheep since the sheep-herders came to New\r\nZealand. The kea darts out of the air, fastens its talons in the side of\r\nthe sheep, and quickly makes a gaping hole into the animal's vitals.\r\nThousands of sheep are thus killed every year.\r\n\r\nThere are about one million people in New Zealand, and most of them live\r\non the east side of South Island. That is where the grassy lands are;\r\nand that is why the cattle and sheep are there also. And the people are\r\nthere because of the sheep and cattle. New Zealand is one of the\r\ngreatest grazing regions in the world, and most of the various\r\nindustries in the islands have something or other to do with the\r\ngrazing.\r\n\r\nIn Australia the sheep are grown almost wholly for wool. That is because\r\nclimate and grasses are just right for the growth of wool. In New\r\nZealand the climate and grasses are not very good for wool, but they are\r\njust right for meat, both mutton and beef. So the commerce of beef and\r\nmutton is the chief business of New Zealand.\r\n\r\nThe meat must go a long way before it reaches the people who consume it;\r\nthey live in Great Britain and western Europe. In any case, too, it must\r\nhave a long summer trip; for one cannot go from New Zealand to Europe\r\nwithout crossing the Torrid Zone. Even if the meat were sent from New\r\nZealand in midwinter it not only has a long trip in the Torrid Zone, but\r\nit gets to Europe in midsummer.\r\n\r\nNow, it is very plain that meat cannot be carried for a month or six\r\nweeks on a steamship without preparation. The preparation is very\r\nsimple; the meat, after dressing, is frozen and it is kept frozen until\r\nit reaches the people who eat it. There are refrigerating-rooms at the\r\nslaughter-houses, refrigerator cars to the nearest port, and\r\nrefrigerator ships to London.\r\n\r\nWool is also one of the important products of New Zealand, but it has a\r\nmuch coarser and harsher fibre than the fine merino wool of Australia.\r\nAs a rule, sheep that are grown for their wool feed on grass; those that\r\nare for mutton get their final feeding on turnips; and all England has\r\nsaid that turnip-fed mutton is good.\r\n\r\nChristchurch, a city of about seventy thousand people, is one of the\r\ngreat centres of the wool and mutton industry. The city is there because\r\nthe great Canterbury Plain is one of the finest grazing regions in the\r\nworld. Christchurch is not very old--it was made a city in 1862--but it\r\nhas grown pretty vigorously. Its handsome buildings--churches, college,\r\nmuseum, and school-houses--are as fine as those of any city of the same\r\nsize anywhere. The streets are wide and beautifully kept, and electric\r\nrailways extend to half a dozen suburbs.\r\n\r\nOut in the suburbs are the large meat-freezing establishments. In the\r\nseason for export about fifteen thousand sheep are dressed and frozen\r\ndaily in the great plants in and around Christchurch.\r\n\r\nThe freezing-rooms are kept at a temperature of a cold winter night. In\r\na single plant there may be as many as ten or fifteen thousand carcasses\r\nhanging from great frames, and the walls of the rooms are covered with a\r\nthick coat of ice and frost. In three days from the time the meat is put\r\ninto the freezing-room it will be ready for its long journey.\r\n\r\nWellington is the capital of New Zealand; it is likewise the windy port\r\nof the Pacific, for it is in the eye of the \"roaring forties,\" the\r\nstrong west wind of the South Temperate Zone. But Wellington has the\r\nharbor, and the harbor has the shipping; and because of this Wellington\r\nis a very rich and prosperous municipality.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, the New Zealanders have not much cause to envy the people\r\nof other lands. Every man and every self-supporting woman can become the\r\nowner of a homestead; and about one person in every ten has become a\r\nlandholder. The government lets them have the land on very easy terms of\r\npayment. Women have the same political rights as are possessed by men.\r\nThey can vote, hold public office, and hold property in their own names.\r\n\r\nThe government has established postal savings banks at which any one may\r\ndeposit money; what is equally good, the money is loaned at a small rate\r\nof interest to farmers while they are waiting for their crops. What is\r\nstill better, the bank never fails, leaving the depositors to whistle\r\nfor their money.\r\n\r\nThe government owns and operates most of the railways, telegraph lines,\r\nand telephone system. There is good service at a low cost. The\r\ngovernment manages and supports all public schools. Attendance is\r\ncompulsory and practically everything is free from the kindergarten to\r\nthe university. There are old-age pensions for deserving poor people of\r\ngood character; there are likewise prisons for those of criminal\r\ncharacter--and the two are pretty apt to get together. \"Bad\" trusts and\r\nmonopolies have not got the upper hand anywhere in New Zealand and the\r\ngovernment sees to it that they do not. Great Britain appoints a\r\ngovernor of the colony, but the people elect a legislative council and a\r\nhouse of representatives.\r\n\r\nNew Zealand has also something more than productive lands; the colony\r\nhas plenty of coal fields, gold-mines, silver-mines, iron ore, and\r\ncopper ore. Even if all the rest of the world were closed against this\r\nfar-away colony, the New Zealanders could worry along quite well, for\r\nthey easily rank among the most prosperous and well-governed people in\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\nSAMOA AND FIJI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Samoa, or Navigator's, Islands, discovered by a Dutch navigator in\r\n1722, attracted but little attention until the introduction of\r\nChristianity in 1830. Only a few of the group are inhabited; the others\r\nare chiefly barren rocks.\r\n\r\nThe islands are of volcanic origin, and earthquakes are frequent, but\r\nnot severe. Fringing coral reefs form barriers that in a great measure\r\nprotect the islands from heavy seas. The group lie on the steamship\r\nroute between Australia and the Pacific coast of North America; hence\r\nthey are important to the United States. The larger islands are\r\nmountainous and well forested. Some of the mountains attain the height\r\nof five thousand feet.\r\n\r\nEarly in the '80's there were three rival chiefs, each of whom wanted to\r\nbe king. As a result, they were at war most of the time, and the\r\nproperty of Americans and Europeans suffered greatly. So, in 1889, Great\r\nBritain, Germany, and the United States formed a joint protectorate over\r\nthem. Ten years later another outbreak was stirred up by foreign\r\nadventurers; so the islands were annexed to Germany and the United\r\nStates for the sake of peace. The two largest, Savii and Upolu, were\r\nceded to Germany; Tutuila and the Manua group were taken by the United\r\nStates. On condition of having a free hand in the Cook group, Great\r\nBritain gave up all claims.\r\n\r\nA rich soil, tropical temperature, and a generous rainfall make the\r\nislands productive. Americans who live there claim that in no other part\r\nof the world can the necessaries of life be obtained so easily as in\r\nSamoa. Savii, the largest island, has a smaller area of cultivable land\r\nthan the others. Once upon a time, however, it was the most densely\r\npeopled and the richest island of all Samoa. Then a volcanic eruption\r\ncovered much of its surface with ash and lava. Perhaps in time the lava\r\nfields may become good soil, as they have in Hawaii.\r\n\r\nTutuila is one of the four islands belonging to the United States; the\r\nother three, Tau, Ofu, and Olosenga, belong to the Manua group. All of\r\nthem together are not half the size of Rhode Island. Tutuila is perhaps\r\nthe most important island of Samoa, because of its fine harbor, Pago\r\nPago--Pango Pango, the Samoans pronounce it. Pago Pago is certainly a\r\nfine harbor. The entrance is so narrow that it can be closed easily;\r\nthen it widens out into a bay two miles long and nearly half a mile\r\nwide. When the Panama Canal is completed, Pago Pago will be right in the\r\ntrack of steamships from Europe and the United States bound for\r\nAustralia.\r\n\r\nApia, on the island of Upolu, is the port of the Germans. The harbor is\r\nlarger, but it is not so well protected. In 1889, when a typhoon struck\r\nApia (both the town and the shipping), very few buildings escaped damage\r\nor destruction. And the shipping?--well, there was not much left. There\r\nwere six warships and a lot of sailing-vessels in the V-shaped harbor.\r\nWhen the storm raged hardest it seemed to grow a bit more furious. Some\r\nof the vessels dragged their anchors and were piled up as wrecks on the\r\nbeach. Others foundered and went to the bottom with all aboard. Three or\r\nfour managed to get out of the bay into the open sea, where they were\r\nfairly safe.\r\n\r\nBut Pago Pago harbor is large and deep. What is still better, it is\r\nsurrounded by bluffs and mountains that will shelter a big fleet against\r\neven the fury of a typhoon.\r\n\r\nMost of the islands are covered with a dense vegetation, tropical and\r\nrichly colored. There is an abundance of hardwood trees, but the\r\nbreadfruit, banana, and cocoa-palm are the most useful. The\r\nbreadfruit-tree grows wild, but it is also cultivated. The fruit is\r\nabout the size of an ordinary cantaloupe. In some species the fruit is\r\nfilled with seeds nearly as large as chestnuts and these are sometimes\r\neaten. The best fruit, however, is filled with starchy matter.\r\n\r\nIt is cooked in many ways, but it is greatly relished when baked in hot\r\nashes covered with live coals. After it is thus cooked, it is cut open\r\nand the rich juicy pulp scooped out. When cooked with meat and gravy it\r\nis superior to the finest mushrooms.\r\n\r\nThe cocoa-palm is a source of not a little profit. The thick husk yields\r\na fibre that is much used in making coarse mats; the dried meat of the\r\nnut is the copra of commerce. Large quantities are exported to the\r\nUnited States and Europe in order to obtain the oil; and the oil is used\r\nchiefly to make soap.\r\n\r\nThe native Samoans are lighter colored than most Polynesians, and are\r\nthe finest native peoples of the South Pacific Ocean. Many years ago\r\nmissionaries and teachers settled in Samoa and they found the natives to\r\nbe pretty apt scholars. By nature they were dignified and polite; they\r\nalso learned quickly the arts of civilized life. Nowadays nearly every\r\nnative village has its church and school-house. The Samoans are fond of\r\nmusic and one may hear American hymns and melodies in nearly every\r\nnative house.\r\n\r\nThe native houses are larger than most of the houses one finds among the\r\nPacific islands. Two or more long posts support the ridge pole and a\r\ngreat number of shorter posts hold the lower edges of the roof. The roof\r\nitself consists of closely fitted mats of brush thickly thatched with\r\nthe leaves of wild sugar cane. A well-made roof lasts a dozen years or\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nMats of sugar-cane closely woven are loosely fastened to the outer rows\r\nof posts so that they can be easily put up or taken down. They form the\r\nside walls of the house. The floor is made of clay, paved with pebbles.\r\nUsually there is a floor covering of mats. In the centre of the floor is\r\na fire pit which serves for the purpose of cooking during the day and to\r\ndrive out the mosquitoes at night. The beds and chairs are mats and the\r\npillows are made of bamboo.\r\n\r\nThe Samoans know how to live well. With each house there is pretty\r\ncertain to be a garden in which yams, taro, sweet potatoes, bananas,\r\nfruit, and chickens are grown. Then, there are fish and shrimps that can\r\nbe caught in abundance. But the chief and most highly prized dish is\r\ncalled \"poi.\" Taro and kalo are names--or a name, rather; for they are\r\ndifferent forms of the same word--given to several plants that grow from\r\nstarchy bulbs. One kind of taro looks much like a lily that grows higher\r\nthan a tall man. The bulb, or root, is first baked and then ground to a\r\npaste with water. When thus prepared, it is set aside until it begins to\r\nferment; then it is ready to be eaten. A great dish or pot of poi is\r\nplaced on a mat and the family gather around, one after another dipping\r\nit out with their hands. To foreigners poi has a most unpleasant,\r\ndisagreeable taste. When made into cakes and baked, however, it is much\r\nrelished by foreigners.\r\n\r\nKava is the national drink. It is made from the roots of a shrub\r\nbelonging to the pepper family. The root is ground between stones and\r\nthen soaked in water. After a while it is pounded and rubbed until all\r\nthe milky juice is squeezed out of it. When \"extra-fine\" kava is wanted,\r\nyoung girls chew the root until it has become pulpy. After standing a\r\nday or two it is strained and is then ready to be drunk. It is a cooling\r\nand refreshing drink, but if taken too freely is apt to tangle one's\r\nlegs uncomfortably.\r\n\r\nOn account of its delightful climate and beautiful scenery, Samoa is\r\none of the most attractive places in the world in which to live. Back in\r\nthe mountains, a few miles from Apia, Robert Louis Stevenson spent the\r\nlast few years of his life, and his body is buried on the top of the\r\nmountain near by. Stevenson was greatly beloved by the natives, and\r\nafter his death he was mourned by them as one of their very best\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nOf all the islands in the South Pacific Ocean, the Fiji group is the\r\nmost important. All told there are more than two hundred islands, but\r\nscarcely one-third of them are inhabited, or even habitable. Two of them\r\nare large. One, Viti Levu, is about the size of Connecticut; the other,\r\nVanua Levu, is about two-thirds the size of that State. The famous Dutch\r\nsailor Abel Janszoon Tasman, whose name is remembered in Tasmania, saw\r\nthe larger islands in 1643. About one hundred and thirty years later\r\nCaptain Cook called at Viti Levu and found himself in the midst of a\r\ngreat cannibal feast. In 1840, Captain Charles Wilkes, in charge of a\r\nUnited States expedition, explored them; shortly afterward they became a\r\npossession of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nThe larger islands are great domes of lava built up by volcanic\r\neruptions; many of the smaller ones are coral formations, and all are\r\nfringed with coral reefs. Dense forests of tropical vegetation cover the\r\nlarger islands. Cocoanut and other palms are everywhere to be found. A\r\nspecies of pine, much like the kauri pine of New Zealand, grows on the\r\nlarger islands. Among the forest trees are also several kinds of\r\ntree-ferns and a tree-nettle. When the pointed leaves of the latter\r\nprick the skin they sting the flesh as badly as does a wasp.\r\n\r\nThe English have done well by both the islands and the islanders. They\r\nhave made the islands yield a good yearly profit to the government\r\nitself, but they have also made the natives industrious and contented.\r\nWhen the first British settlements were made in Fiji, the islanders\r\nwere in a most degraded condition. They did no work except to grow a few\r\nyams, bananas, and breadfruit. Their chief employment was war, and this\r\nwas carried on, not for conquest, but to capture as many as possible. A\r\nfew captives were held as slaves, but most of them were fattened--to be\r\nkilled and eaten at the royal feasts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Native canoe, Fiji Islands]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all this there was the making of a very superior people\r\nin them; for when the missionaries and the teachers got among them the\r\nnatives proved very apt pupils. Now there are more than twelve hundred\r\nchurch buildings--and a school-house or two for every church. Some of\r\nthe ministers and teachers are English, but there are about four\r\nthousand native teachers and ministers, nearly all of whom were trained\r\nfor their work in the island schools.\r\n\r\nThey are fine farmers, probably the best in the islands of the Pacific.\r\nThey grow bananas, pineapples, peanuts, and lemons for the Australians,\r\ncopra and tobacco for the British, and rice, taro, and garden vegetables\r\nfor themselves. They have learned to irrigate their farms, using open\r\nditches and bamboo mains. They make the finest canoes to be found in the\r\nPacific. Some of the canoes are barges nearly one hundred feet in\r\nlength; and not even the Hawaiians are more expert in using them.\r\n\r\nNot a little profit to the islanders comes from the sea. They are expert\r\ndivers and gather large quantities of pearl shells, which find a ready\r\nmarket with the button-makers of Europe. Fish are caught, dried, and\r\nsold in China. One sea product, the bêche-de-mer, a marine animal\r\ncommonly called \"sea-cucumber,\" is highly prized by the Chinese, who use\r\nlarge quantities; most of it is gathered by the Fijians.\r\n\r\nSugar, however, is the chief product of the islands, and the sugar\r\nplantations are owned by great companies that have invested millions of\r\npounds sterling in the business. The plantations altogether produce more\r\nthan three million dollars' worth of sugar yearly. The native islanders\r\nwill not work in the sugar fields; so coolies from India were brought to\r\nthe islands to work on the plantations.\r\n\r\nSuva (Viti Levu), and Leonka (Ovalu), the two largest towns, are much\r\nlike European cities, except that the houses are low and have large\r\nyards filled with shade trees and flowers. In the native villages the\r\ndwellings are much like those in Samoa, though a trifle better, perhaps.\r\nThe side walls are covered with plaited reeds, and the roof is thatched\r\nwith palm leaves securely fastened. In the lowlands it is customary to\r\nbuild a platform of rock upon which the house stands and into which the\r\nfoundation poles are set. This is done for two reasons: when a typhoon\r\nsweeps over the islands, the lowland coast is sometimes flooded;\r\nmoreover, the wind blows with such terrific force that none but the most\r\nstrongly built house will withstand it.\r\n\r\nIn the centre of the floor is a pit, or fireplace, much like the\r\ncooking-place one sees in Samoa or in Hawaii. Chickens and pieces of\r\nmeat to be roasted are hung from a frame over the pit. Yams and other\r\nvegetables are boiled in earthen vessels which the native potters make.\r\nThe floors are covered with closely woven mats; and in order to keep\r\nthem clean an earthen vessel filled with water is kept outside so that\r\nwhoever enters the house may bathe his feet. Inasmuch as the natives go\r\nbarefoot one may see the usefulness of this custom.\r\n\r\nGreat Britain has many islands in this part of the Pacific; Gilbert,\r\nEllice, Tonga, Cook, and some of the Solomon group all fly the Union\r\nJack. There is an English governor, or \"High Commissioner,\" as he is\r\nstyled, who looks after British affairs in the islands. In Fiji he is\r\nthe real governor, but in many of the islands native chiefs and kings\r\ngovern their peoples about as they please, provided they do not\r\ninterfere with British interests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\nTHE HAWAIIAN ISLANDS\r\n\r\n\r\nAlmost midway between the United States and China a mountain chain more\r\nthan three thousand miles long crosses the tropic of Cancer. Only the\r\nhighest peaks, however, reach above sea level; most of the range is\r\nfathoms deep in the waters of the Pacific. The eastern end of this great\r\nchain constitutes the Hawaiian group of islands, or the Territory of\r\nHawaii.\r\n\r\nAltogether they are pretty nearly as large as the State of New Jersey,\r\nor five times the size of Rhode Island. All the islands are very rugged\r\nin surface--steep and high cliffs, deep valleys and canyons, and\r\nstupendous craters that have vomited great floods of lava. A little way\r\nfrom shore the Pacific has some of its deepest beds. If the sea could be\r\nremoved the island of Hawaii would be a great dome five miles high.\r\n\r\nThe coral polyps have added their mite to the building of these islands,\r\nand coral reefs are the foundation of the coast plain that surrounds a\r\nconsiderable part of the girth of each.\r\n\r\nAn equable climate throughout the year, a soft and balmy air, brilliant\r\ncoloring on bush and tree, magnificent pictures of sea and sky, and of\r\nmountain and plain, make the islands a veritable paradise.\r\n\r\nIt is thought that these islands were peopled by Samoan natives about\r\nthe year 600, and that subsequently their number was augmented by\r\nemigrants from the Fiji and other southern islands. At first there was\r\nplenty of land for all, but as their number increased, quarrels arose.\r\nEach island had its king or chief and some of the larger islands had two\r\nor more. The result was a condition very much like the feudal system;\r\neach king had petty chiefs, and these, in turn, their retainers, who\r\nwere little better than slaves. Priests, who ranked equal to the petty\r\nchiefs, directed their pagan worship and occasionally made human\r\nsacrifices.\r\n\r\nThe kings were pretty apt to be at war with one another most of the\r\ntime, but, about forty years before the American Revolution, there came\r\na great soldier and leader, Kamehameha I. By the aid of European weapons\r\nand the counsel of foreign friends, he overcame his rivals and brought\r\nall the islands under his sway.\r\n\r\nThe Hawaiian Islands were made known to the rest of the world when that\r\nplucky English sailor, Captain James Cook, was making his third and\r\nlast great voyage of discovery, in which he had set out to find the\r\nfamous and tragic northwest passage. On a roundabout way to Bering\r\nStrait, he called at the islands which seemed very attractive to him.\r\nPerhaps it is not quite right to say that he discovered them, for it\r\nseems very probable that the Spanish explorer Gaetano discovered them in\r\n1555.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: General view of Volcano House, Kilauea, Hawaii]\r\n\r\nIt was 1789 when Cook first visited the islands, and after he had\r\ncontinued his voyage through Bering Strait, and had failed to find the\r\nnorthwest passage, he turned about and sailed for the islands. While\r\nashore with a part of his crew at a landing that is now the village of\r\nKealakekua, one of the ship's boats was stolen by natives.\r\n\r\nNow Cook had learned to manage South Sea islanders in a very practical,\r\nthough not the most tactful, way. When trouble occurred he used to send\r\nout a strong landing party, seize the king or chief and take him aboard\r\nthe vessel--a proceeding which usually brought the natives to terms.\r\nBut at this particular time the landing party was driven to the boats\r\nand Cook was killed.\r\n\r\nThe group of islands was first named after Lord Sandwich, a patron and\r\nfriend of Cook. At the time of Cook's discovery of the long-forgotten\r\nislands it was estimated that their population was not far from four\r\nhundred thousand. Missionaries went to the islands early in the\r\nnineteenth century and their reports brought many Americans and\r\nEuropeans who settled there permanently. Then the chief business of the\r\nislands was the ordinary trade with the many whaling vessels that were\r\nin the Pacific.\r\n\r\nFor a time the islands were under the protection of Great Britain; then\r\nthey became an independent kingdom. When it was found that the lava\r\nfields made the best sugar-growing soil in the world, American capital\r\ncame in millions of dollars to be invested in great plantations of sugar\r\ncane.\r\n\r\nTrouble between the queen and American business interests became so\r\nserious in time that the queen was dethroned and the Republic of Hawaii\r\nwas established. The republic was short-lived, however; for when the\r\nSpanish-American war occurred, it was seen that Hawaii is the key to the\r\nPacific Ocean. The Hawaiians, foreigners and natives, had long wished to\r\nbecome a part of the United States. So the islands were annexed and\r\nshortly became the Territory of Hawaii.\r\n\r\nThere are six large islands--Hawaii, Maui, Oahu, Kauai, Molokai, and\r\nLanai. There are many small outlying islets, most of which are not\r\ninhabited. Wireless telegraph stations connect the principal islands; an\r\nocean cable ties the Territory to San Francisco; and steamship lines\r\ncarry on commerce with British, Japanese, and American ports. Even the\r\nrailway-builder has not forgotten Hawaii, for there are not far from two\r\nhundred miles of railroad, about half of which carry the products of\r\nthe sugar and coffee plantations to the near-by ports.\r\n\r\nHawaii, the largest island, is famous for its great volcanoes, Kea, Loá,\r\nand Kilauea. From the village or city of Hilo comfortable coaches take\r\nvisitors over a fine road clear to the crater of Kilauea. At times one\r\nmay stand on the edge of Kilauea's rampart and look down on a lake of\r\nwhite-hot, molten lava three miles long and half as wide. Every now and\r\nthen bubbles of gas or steam come to the surface and exploding send long\r\nthreads of viscous lava into the air. Some of the glassy threads are\r\nfine as the finest silk and a blast of air carries them off to the\r\ncliff; Pele's hair, they call it, and the sea-gulls gather it to make\r\ntheir nests.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A lake of white-hot molten lava. The volcano of\r\nMauna-Loá, Hawaii]\r\n\r\nThe highest points of Hawaii island are nearly fourteen thousand feet\r\nabove sea level. Below the line of about ten thousand feet easterly\r\nwinds bring an abundance of rain; above that line westerly winds bring\r\noccasional showers and snow squalls. As a result one may find places\r\nonly a few miles apart, one of which has almost daily rains while the\r\nother gets none at all along the lowland coasts.\r\n\r\nOahu is the best-known island because of Honolulu, the capital of the\r\nTerritory. A most beautiful city it is; indeed, there is nothing\r\nelsewhere to surpass it in attractiveness--wide streets, beautiful\r\nparks, flower gardens of wonderful plants, fine dwellings, electric\r\nstreet cars, good government, and schools that are famous. All these\r\nthings make Honolulu one of the most desirable and attractive cities of\r\nhomes anywhere in the world.\r\n\r\nJust back of Honolulu is a volcanic peak with its great crater--the\r\n\"Punch Bowl,\" they call it, because of its shape. As one looks down from\r\nthe rim of the Punch Bowl the city is half hidden among its palms and\r\nalgeroba trees. Above the trees are the domes and turrets of the\r\nNational Palace, the government building, and the school-houses. In the\r\ndistance here and there are the great plantations--sugar, rice, and\r\nbanana.\r\n\r\nIn the city streets one will see the people of many lands--Germans,\r\nEnglish, Americans, native Hawaiians, Chinese, Japanese, Koreans,\r\nMalays, and Hindoos. Many of the native Hawaiians are rich and\r\nprosperous; some are in business, and others are in professional life.\r\nMany of the Chinese are well-to-do merchants. The Hindoos, Malays, and\r\nJapanese were brought to Hawaii to work in the great plantations.\r\n\r\nIn the native villages one will frequently find a little church building\r\nand almost always the district school. Perhaps there may also be a\r\nChinese store. Black-eyed children are running about dressed in long\r\ngowns, and some of them carry little bundles of school-books, each tied\r\nwith stout cord or a leather strap.\r\n\r\nThe Hawaiians will not work in the sugar and the rice fields, and not\r\nmany will stand the easier labor on the coffee plantations. In\r\ncultivating their little patches of bananas, breadfruit, cassava, and\r\ntaro, however, they are pretty industrious. When the time of the royal\r\nfeast comes, the natives, or \"Kanakas,\" as they call themselves, get\r\nbusy. The feast certainly is a royal one. Roast pig and roast chicken\r\nare smoking in a dozen dirt ovens. There are steaming yams and sweet\r\npotatoes by the bushel, great piles of all sorts of fruit--and poi. All\r\nthe rest of the food is commonplace; poi is _the_ dish. It is one-finger\r\npoi, two-finger poi, or three-finger poi, according as it is thick\r\nenough to be lifted out of the pot sticking to one finger, or so thin as\r\nto require a dextrous swish of two or three.\r\n\r\nWaikiki is the great resort of Honolulu. There is the finest of bathing\r\nthe year round; and what is more interesting, the native surf swimmers.\r\nWith a piece of plank just large enough to support his weight in the\r\nwater, the bather swims out to the reef in still water. Then he, or\r\nshe--for young girls are most expert swimmers--makes for open water,\r\nwhere the combers are forming. Then, lying flat, bather and plank are\r\nborne along on the swift rolling surf until both are tossed high on the\r\nbeach.\r\n\r\nThe aquarium is famous for its unique collection of fish and marine\r\nanimals; it is one of the finest in the world. Near by is the race\r\ncourse and amphitheatre. What is still better is the winding road\r\nthrough ferns and flowers that leads to the crater rampart, Diamond\r\nHill.\r\n\r\nHalf a dozen miles west of Honolulu one goes by rail around the shore of\r\nPearl Lochs, or Harbor. Pearl Harbor is large enough and deep enough to\r\nfloat all the warships Uncle Sam will ever own, and the possession of\r\nthis magnificent site for a naval station was a very strong inducement\r\nto annex Hawaii.\r\n\r\nLess than one hundred miles away, at Kalaupapa, on the island of\r\nMolokai, is the leper settlement. Years ago Chinese settlers brought the\r\ndisease to Hawaii; then the natives began to be stricken, and when it\r\nwas found that leprosy was spreading, the lepers were sent to Molokai.\r\nFor many years they had but little care; the government fed and clothed\r\nthe poor victims and that was about all.\r\n\r\nIn 1873 Father Damien, a plucky Catholic priest, went to Molokai and\r\nthereby made himself practically a prisoner for life. Father Damien\r\nprocured physicians, trained nurses, and the best possible care for the\r\nlepers, and they could at least die in comfort if they could not live.\r\nThen Father Damien himself was stricken and died. By this time, however,\r\nthe government took the matter in hand. A fine hospital was built and a\r\nlaboratory for the study of the disease was established. Those who are\r\nable to work can partly support themselves, and they are far better off\r\nwhen busy than when idle.\r\n\r\nIn 1848 the \"Great Division\" took place; that is, the lands for the\r\nking, for the public domain, and for the people were set aside, so that\r\nthe people who so desired could own their farms and dwellings. At that\r\ntime the islands were important only as a calling place for whaling\r\nvessels. At the present time Dame Nature is made to yield annually not\r\nfar from one hundred million dollars' worth of products--sugar, rice,\r\ncoffee, fruit, and cattle. A few years hence, tobacco, rubber, cotton,\r\nand honey will be added to the list of exported products.\r\n\r\nAmericans own the sugar plantations, which are mainly on the lava fields\r\nof Hawaii, Oahu, and Maui Islands. The Chinese and Japanese cultivate\r\nthe rice along the coast lowlands of Oahu and Kauai. Sheep and cattle\r\nare grown on Lanai and Niihau.\r\n\r\nUncle Sam has brought some very valuable additions to his public domain,\r\nbut no investment has paid better than Hawaii, the Paradise of the\r\nPacific.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\nGUAM\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile cruising in the Pacific Ocean Magellan discovered a chain of\r\nislands about fifteen hundred miles east of the Philippine group. While\r\nhe lay at anchor, predatory natives stole some of his belongings;\r\nthereupon Magellan gave them a bad name, and to this day the islands\r\nbear the name Ladrones, or \"thieves\" islands.\r\n\r\nGuam, the largest island in the group, became more or less important\r\njust after the Spanish-American War, inasmuch as it was required as one\r\nof our chain of naval and coaling stations that pretty nearly encircles\r\nthe earth. As islands go, Guam is of fair size, about thirty miles long\r\nand from three to ten miles in width. It is mountainous and the surface\r\nis jungle-covered except where the natives have made trails and\r\nclearings. Fringing coral reefs, broken here and there, encircle the\r\nisland. One of these breaks is opposite a bight in the coast, San Luis\r\nd'Apra, or Apra, as it is now called; and the bay and channel together\r\nform a harbor so well guarded that no transport laden with hostile\r\ntroops would ever attempt landing.\r\n\r\nIn 1668 a mission was established. At this time the population numbered\r\nabout one hundred thousand. The country was so well cultivated that the\r\nwhole island seemed like a beautiful garden, for the people were pretty\r\ngood farmers. Rice and tropical fruits were cultivated in abundance.\r\nThe natives were also skilful in the making of pottery and they had a\r\nwell-regulated calendar.\r\n\r\nFor a time they were well disposed toward their intruders; but at\r\nlength, as they began to learn that conversion to the Christian faith\r\nmeant also slavery to the Spanish, they rebelled against a system which\r\nwas so one-sided, and their opposition led to constant strife and\r\nbloodshed.\r\n\r\nIn the course of time the severe treatment of the Spaniards, together\r\nwith contagious diseases introduced, so completely wiped out the native\r\npopulation that, at the end of seventy years, scarcely two thousand were\r\nleft. Perhaps no peoples in all the South Sea Islands have suffered more\r\nkeenly from contact with Europeans than these aborigines.\r\n\r\nFrightened at the terrible mortality they had caused, the conquerors\r\nturned to the Philippines to replenish the depopulated island. Tagals\r\nwere brought over to occupy the place of the fast-disappearing natives,\r\nand with these many of the natives intermarried. The half-castes are\r\ninferior to the original inhabitants, but they have increased in\r\npopulation, and now number ten thousand.\r\n\r\nSpain ceded Guam to the United States in 1898. Since the acquisition our\r\ngovernment has established both day and evening schools for the natives,\r\nand they are making rapid progress in education.\r\n\r\nIt is a long journey to Guam--thirty-five hundred miles almost from\r\nHonolulu and not quite half as far from Manila. And how to get there?\r\nWell, it is not an easy matter. If you go to Apia, or to Manila, and\r\nremain long enough--perhaps six weeks, maybe six months--a German\r\ntrading schooner will come along and take you aboard. You get there in\r\ntime; for the trading schooner is likely to make a very circuitous trip,\r\ncalling at a dozen islands to get copra in exchange for cloth, knives,\r\nand cheap jewelry. But if one happens to have the right sort of \"pull,\"\r\none can get a pass on an army transport. That means a most delightful\r\ntrip from San Francisco to Honolulu, and thence to Guam. Uncle Sam does\r\nthe square thing by his soldiers, and the army transports that carry\r\nthem to the distant stations are fitted so as to be as comfortable as\r\nthe best liners. There are a big exercise deck and a reading-room with\r\nplenty of books. Not the least important part of the equipment is a\r\nself-playing piano and a good assortment of music.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Native ploughing in rice-field, Guam. One may find\r\nrice-farms as skilfully cultivated as those of Japan or China]\r\n\r\nThere is not very much to see after one reaches Guam. One village is\r\njust about the same as all the others. Perhaps half a dozen huts are\r\nbuilt of mud, or possibly of coral limestone; the rest are made of\r\nbamboo frames covered with palm--all in one room in which the family\r\nand the pig live.\r\n\r\nAgaña, however, is a village of six or seven thousand people. It is laid\r\nout in streets which are fairly regular. They are deep with dust during\r\nthe dry season, and with mud the rest of the year. There are several\r\ngovernment buildings which are neat and trim, two or three churches,\r\nseveral school buildings, and a few stores. Most of the people one meets\r\non the street speak Spanish; a few speak English. English is the coming\r\nlanguage, however; for the schools are there to stay and every one of\r\nthe fifteen hundred youngsters who attend school carries away a little\r\nEnglish. A fine road bordered with palms connects Agaña with Apra, seven\r\nmiles south.\r\n\r\nThere is not much to see in Guam. The scenery is much like that of every\r\nisland in that part of the Pacific. About the only diversion of the\r\nsoldiers stationed there is hunting, which is pretty good if one is\r\ncontent to hunt deer and wild hogs. Artistic sportsmen might prefer the\r\ndeer, but all the real fun is the share of the hog-hunters. The hogs are\r\nsavage beasts when cornered; they likewise are full of animal cunning.\r\n\r\nAlong the coast lowlands one may find rice-farms as skilfully cultivated\r\nas those of Japan or of China. Most of the rice is consumed on the\r\nisland; however, copra, or dried cocoanut, is an export, and its sale\r\nbrings enough money to the natives to purchase the cloth and other goods\r\nneeded. Since American occupation the caçao tree has been cultivated,\r\nand cocoa bids fair to be the chief export in the near future.\r\n\r\nThe government of Guam is better under American rule than at any time in\r\nthe previous history of the island. When the late Admiral Schroeder was\r\ngovernor of Guam he consulted his log-book and discovered that he was\r\naltogether too far away from Washington to be tied to rules and\r\nregulations, or to be tangled up in official red tape. So he cut the\r\ntape and used good common sense instead. Perhaps the government was a\r\nbit patriarchal, but it was good, clean, and wholesome--and every one\r\nprofited by it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\nTHE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS\r\n\r\n\r\nOur newest possession, the Philippine Archipelago, in a way, is also our\r\noldest, for the islands were discovered by Ferdinand Magellan in 1521,\r\nabout twenty-nine years after the great discovery of Columbus. Magellan\r\ncalled at several islands, among them Mindanao and Cebú. He anchored in\r\nthe harbor on which the city of Cebú now stands. He seems to have been\r\ntreated in a very friendly manner by the natives of Cebú, but when he\r\ncrossed to a near-by island he was attacked and killed. The friendship\r\nof the King of Cebú was not very steadfast, for after Magellan's death\r\nseveral of his officers were put to death by the king's order.\r\n\r\nFor two hundred and forty years the islands were a possession of Spain;\r\nthen they were captured by a British fleet. They were soon restored to\r\nSpain, however, and remained a Spanish possession until 1898, when they\r\nwere ceded to us after the Spanish-American War.\r\n\r\nThere are more than three thousand islands in the archipelago, and they\r\nare the partly covered tops of a mountainous and rugged plateau. Many\r\nvolcanoes testify to the volcanic origin of the plateau; indeed, the\r\nsurface of the plateau seems to be a thin crust over--well, over\r\ntrouble; for the dozen or more volcanoes are never quiet long enough to\r\nbe forgotten. Perhaps it was proper to name the islands after Philip II\r\nof Spain, for he, too, had his full measure of trouble.\r\n\r\nThe archipelago is of pretty good size. The whole plateau, land and\r\nwater, is about as large as that part of the United States east of\r\nChicago; and the islands themselves are pretty nearly as large as the\r\nState of Texas. Luzon, the largest island, is about as large as\r\nPennsylvania, and Mindanao is a bit smaller. Then there are Samar,\r\nPanay, Palawan, and Cebú--every one large enough to make a State of fair\r\nsize, and every one with enough people to make a State.\r\n\r\nThere are about seven million people all told, most of whom are of the\r\nMalay race. As a rule, they are pretty well along toward civilization;\r\nsome of them are educated. There are also tribes of the black\r\nrace--Negritos, they are called--who are just plain savages. They are\r\nthe original inhabitants of the islands, and it is most likely that they\r\nare the descendants of people from New Guinea. In the southwest is the\r\nSulu group, inhabited by Malays, called Moros. They are Muhammadans in\r\nreligion and are the last of the Malays who came to the islands.\r\n\r\nOf all the Malay peoples, the Tagalogs of Luzon have been the foremost\r\nto learn the arts of western civilization. They have surpassed their\r\nnear relatives, the Visayans, who live in the central part of the\r\nislands. Perhaps it is the closer contact with the Spanish that has\r\ngiven the Tagalogs their great progress. At all events they have become\r\nwell to do and prosperous as measured by other Malay peoples.\r\n\r\nThe Moros, who live mainly in the southern part, have scarcely reached\r\ncivilization. In the Sulu islands they have their own government, at the\r\nhead of which is a native sultan. In many parts of the islands there are\r\ntribes governed by chiefs called \"dattos.\" Some of the natives are\r\nprosperous farmers, but many of them are savages.\r\n\r\nA great deal has been said about the misrule and cruelty of the Spanish\r\ngovernors and officials. Being soldiers and task-masters it is likely\r\nthat they did many things that will not stand the searchlight of\r\ncivilization. But the work of the priests will always leave a pleasant\r\nflavor. For three hundred years they braved every danger and suffered\r\nevery hardship in their work. For every one that fell a victim to\r\ndisease, or to the bolo, there was another ready to fill his place. They\r\nnot only converted the natives to Christianity, but they also taught\r\nthem to be thrifty farmers and prosperous business men. As a result the\r\nFilipinos are the only Asian people of considerable numbers that have\r\nyet become Christians.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The carabao, harnessed to a dray or wagon, shuffles\r\nalong]\r\n\r\nWhen the Philippine Islands became a possession of the United States,\r\none of the first things done was to establish several thousand schools.\r\nA thousand American teachers were at first employed. Training schools\r\nfor teachers were established, and in the course of a few years more\r\nthan five thousand Filipino teachers were conducting native schools.\r\nEnglish is taught in all the schools, and there are special schools in\r\nwhich agriculture, mechanical trades, and commerce are taught.\r\n\r\nThere is good reason for all this, for the islands have wonderful\r\nresources. Gold, silver, copper, and iron are abundant. The forests have\r\nan abundance of hard woods that sooner or later will find a market both\r\nin Europe and America. The rice-fields will easily produce enough grain\r\nfor the whole population, and a considerable amount to sell in addition,\r\nwhen all the rice-lands are cultivated. For want of good wagon roads and\r\nrailways only a small part of the rice-lands are cultivated.\r\n\r\nThere is an abundance of good grazing land that will produce meat for\r\ntwice the present population. Most of the cattle now grown in the\r\nislands are of the kind found in India.\r\n\r\nThe most common beast of burden, however, is the carabao, or\r\nwater-buffalo. What an ugly looking beast it is! It is as clumsy as a\r\nhippopotamus, as ugly as a rhinoceros, and as kind and gentle as an old\r\nmuley cow. Harnessed to a dray or a wagon, it shuffles along, its big,\r\nflat feet seeming to walk all over the road. But those same big feet are\r\nthe animal's chief stock in trade. They enable him to walk through both\r\nsand and deep mud--mud so soft and deep that a horse or a mule would\r\nsink to its body. Nothing but the carabao's flatboat-like feet could\r\ndrag ploughs through the soft mud of the rice-fields.\r\n\r\nCarabaos are easily trained to farm work, and even children can drive\r\nthem--or ride on their backs in going to school. The milk of a carabao\r\nis as good and wholesome as that of an ordinary cow; the meat is pretty\r\ntough, but it is not unwholesome.\r\n\r\nOne thing, however, the carabao must have, and that is a bath several\r\ntimes a day. Deprived of its bath, the animal at first becomes restless;\r\nthen it breaks away in a half-crazed condition for the nearest water,\r\nwhere it buries itself, all but its head. Native drivers know just how\r\nto manage their animals and drive them to the nearest water several\r\ntimes a day.\r\n\r\nThere are horses in the islands, but not many. Most of them are very\r\nmuch like the mustang. The Spanish brought Andalusian ponies to the\r\nislands many years ago, but they did not prove very useful. Within a few\r\nyears American horses were introduced, but they could not live on\r\nPhilippine grasses. Mexican mustangs and Mongolian ponies were much\r\nbetter, however, but they are used chiefly as riding animals.\r\n\r\nOf all the beasts of burden in the Philippine Islands, none is in the\r\nsame class with John Chinaman. Everywhere his bland smile is seen; his\r\npatience has no end--and, apparently, his work has none. The Filipino\r\nfarmer works merely to keep body and soul together; John Chinaman works\r\nto save hard cash, and he saves it. Wherever there is any money to be\r\nmade, John is pretty certain to be near by. He is the cook and\r\n\"maid-of-all-work\" in the house of the foreign resident, the stevedore\r\non the dock, the clerk in the forwarding house, the \"boss\" in the rice\r\nplantation, the handy man in the tobacco factory, and the store-keeper\r\nin the remote Filipino village. Sixteen hours of hard work every day and\r\nSunday seem to make him grow fat; the rest of the time he just works for\r\nfun--and hard cash.\r\n\r\nLong before the Chinese coolie came to the United States the Spanish\r\nraised the cry \"The Chinese must go.\" The Spanish made short work of\r\nthem, killing them by thousands and tens of thousands. But in a year or\r\ntwo John was on hand again, smiling and working sixteen hours a\r\nday--strictly for cash. And he is in the Philippine Islands to stay.\r\n\r\nAs a rule the Filipinos rarely live isolated as do the American farmers.\r\nAlmost always they cluster in villages of one or two hundred people. The\r\nFilipino is not likely to cultivate a big farm. Two or three acres will\r\nsupply the family with all the food required, and the Chinese merchant\r\nwill buy enough of his produce to provide a few dollars in cash and the\r\ncloth for the family wearing apparel. In the smaller villages there is\r\nan open place that answers for a street, but the houses are apt to be\r\nscattered about without much regularity of arrangement.\r\n\r\nThe houses, like those of the Pacific islands generally, are built of\r\nbamboo frames--heavy pieces for the framework itself and woven bamboo\r\nsplints for the side sheathing. The roof is carefully thatched with the\r\nleaves of the nipa-palm and these are sewn into a thick mat with ratan.\r\nIn places where the ground is likely to be overflowed, each house is set\r\non posts so that the floors are several feet from the ground. In this\r\ncase the \"pig\" does not \"live in the parlor\"; the pigs and chickens\r\noccupy the \"ground floor.\" All told, the Filipino village mansion may\r\nnot be very ornate, but it is extremely comfortable.\r\n\r\nThe larger villages and cities are built much alike. There is a plaza or\r\npublic square. Around the four sides, and facing the plaza, are the\r\nchurch, government buildings, and stores. The more pretentious\r\nresidences are near by. Further away these give place to the Filipino,\r\nor \"nipa houses,\" as they are called. The street surrounding the plaza\r\nis broad and well kept; elsewhere the streets are quagmires in the\r\nrainy, and dust holes in the dry season. Pretty nearly always there is a\r\nChinese quarter that is crowded and dirty; quite likely, too, the best\r\nstores in the town are kept by Chinese merchants. That is the way the\r\nSpaniards laid out their cities and towns in Spain; they did not change\r\nthe plan in the Philippines. The houses built for them in the islands\r\nare much like those in Spanish towns--adobe walls plastered with stucco,\r\nand roofed with tiles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The harbor of the city. Scene on the Pasig River, Manila]\r\n\r\nManila is the capital and commercial centre of the islands. It is a city\r\nabout as large as Seattle, and is situated at the head of a landlocked\r\nbody of water, Manila Bay. Corregidor Island, a little dark-green islet,\r\nguards the entrance to the bay; and one cannot see the wicked guns that\r\nare ready to pour a raking fire into a hostile fleet until one is within\r\na few hundred yards of the island. The only thing visible at a distance\r\nis a flag flying from a high mast; but it is the Stars and Stripes that\r\nbends to the east wind. The bay is a good-sized bit of water, too. In\r\nthe middle of it one can just barely see the gray, misty hills that\r\nsurround it. Then the shore line begins to take shape and the mouth of\r\nPasig River seems to open in front of the incoming steamship. In a few\r\nminutes the harbor of the city is in sight. Steamships, with their\r\npainted stacks and funnels, and sailing vessels, with every sort of mast\r\nand rigging, crowd the harbor. Row-boats by the hundred are moving in\r\nevery direction, and little steam-launches and motor-boats are spitting\r\nviciously as they go back and forth.\r\n\r\nThe lower part of the city is almost like Amsterdam; it is traversed by\r\ncanals, great and small, in which are fishing-smacks waiting to have the\r\ncatch taken to market. Puffy, wheezy tugs are making fast to huge\r\ncascoes, or lighters; for the cargoes must be taken from the docks to\r\nthe steamships and sailing-vessels out in the harbor.\r\n\r\nThe Pasig is only ten or twelve miles in length. It flows from a near-by\r\nlake, and both sides of the river are lined with villages, and\r\nmarket-gardens, and duck-hatcheries.\r\n\r\nThe business streets are crowded with carts and drays. Here and there\r\nare smart-looking carriages carrying well-groomed men, who talk little\r\nand look rich. There could not be more style and ceremony about them if\r\nthey were in New York, London, or Paris. Trim-looking soldiers in khaki\r\nuniforms, native Filipinos in white suits, Chinese in silk gowns and\r\nlong sleeves, native women wearing red skirts and black shawls, native\r\ncoolies in loose blouses and short pantaloons--all go to make up the\r\nthrong of the streets.\r\n\r\nMost of the houses are two stories in height with arcades or awnings\r\nthat shelter the sidewalks. And such narrow sidewalks!--they are hardly\r\nwide enough for more than three people to walk abreast. But even the\r\nbusiness houses are built for comfort. The roof has a broad overhang,\r\nand quite likely there is a covered veranda.\r\n\r\nMany of the Filipinos of Manila are educated and prosperous. Their\r\nhouses are said to be furnished in European style, and likewise their\r\nclothing. Sure enough everything bears a \"made in Germany\" mark, but\r\neverything looks distinctly Filipino. The head of the family wears a\r\nsuit of spotless white duck, but it has a military cut--and perhaps he\r\ngoes about the house barefoot; if so, he knows what real comfort is.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Extracting indigo in Ilocos Province, Philippine Islands]\r\n\r\nMother and daughters wear skirts of beautiful brocaded silk, very wide\r\nand full; above the skirt is a loose garment much like a shirt-waist cut\r\nlow at the neck, and over this a lace cape with a wide, flowing collar.\r\nPossibly they wear heelless slippers, but just as likely they, too, are\r\nbarefoot--when no visitors are present. Perhaps such suits are not quite\r\nso becoming as the trim, tailor-made suits in New York, but they are a\r\nlot more comfortable.\r\n\r\nA short distance from the Escolta, or chief business street, is one of\r\nthe many markets of Manila. The whole space is laid off with rows of\r\nbamboo booths. Pretty nearly everything to eat, to wear, or to furnish\r\nthe house is on hand--or rather in loose piles--fish, duck's eggs, meat,\r\nrice, pinole, fruit of forty kinds, straw hats, straw sandals, straw\r\nraincoats, tin ware from America, wooden ware from Holland, and clay\r\nstoves \"made in Manila.\"\r\n\r\nEvery alley has its own wares, and John Chinaman with his baskets\r\nbalanced on a long pole puts a finishing touch to the market. A Filipino\r\ncannot be emphatic in an ordinary tone of voice. Buyer and seller work\r\nthemselves up to high C pitch until it seems as though nothing short of\r\na fit would overtake both. Bedlam is turned loose in every part of the\r\nmarket. Usually a man and his wife are required to conduct the business\r\nat a booth. Their bare feet sticking out from the skirts bob up and\r\ndown, beating time to the clatter of their voices.\r\n\r\nHere comes a man whose sole stock in trade consists of a single article,\r\nnamely, a python. His goods are twined about a pole with a cross piece\r\nfor a perch, but the snake's tail has a loving twist around the owner's\r\nneck. What for?--well, the python has a sweet tooth for rats and mice\r\nand the sweet tooth of this particular snake is on edge for a square\r\nmeal. Years ago foreign ships brought rats from various countries. In\r\nthe course of time rats and mice became so numerous that it became a\r\nquestion whether Manila should exterminate the rats or the rats\r\nexterminate Manila.\r\n\r\nNow, those same ships ought to have brought some cats along, too. But it\r\nis just as well that they did not, for one python is worth half a dozen\r\ncats or rat terriers when business is on hand. The only drawback occurs\r\nwhen the python insists on getting into bed with his owner to keep warm.\r\n\r\nWhen in Manila, go to Duck-town by all means. It is only a short\r\ndistance from the near-by market. The feeding grounds and hatcheries\r\nextend for two miles along the river. Hundreds of thousands of ducks are\r\nreared at the hatcheries, some for eggs, and others for food. The ducks\r\nare fed on shell-fish, and foreigners imagine that both the meat and the\r\neggs have a fishy flavor. Eggs and edible bird's nests are also brought\r\nfrom neighboring sea-cliffs to the Manila markets; and both are\r\nconsidered great delicacies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Manila hemp as it is brought in from the country]\r\n\r\nManila is the largest city of the Philippines, but there are also\r\nseveral other cities of good lusty growth. Bauan, Lipa, Laoag, and\r\nBatangas--all in Luzon--and Ilo-ilo in Panay are growing in population\r\nand business as the resources of the islands develop. Since the\r\nAmerican occupation, Uncle Sam has done a great deal to make these ports\r\ncentres of business; harbors have been deepened; railways have been\r\nextended; good roads have been built; and rivers have been made\r\nnavigable.\r\n\r\nThere are several exports that will always tend to make the Philippines\r\nrich. Tobacco is an important crop and the Manila leaf, as it is called,\r\nis of very fine quality. There are those who whisper it about that much\r\nof the leaf is shipped to Cuba to be made into \"Havana\" cigars. Sugar is\r\nalso a great export crop, and when the railways now under way are\r\ncompleted sugar will become one of the foremost exports. The export of\r\ncopra, or dried cocoanut, is a leading industry, and the Philippine\r\nIslands produce a large part of the world's product.\r\n\r\nOne Philippine product, however, connects the islands with almost all\r\nthe rest of the world, namely, Manila hemp. That is, it is called\r\n\"hemp,\" but it is not hemp at all; the fibre is obtained from a plant\r\nvery closely related to the banana. White leaves or husks grow closely\r\naround the stalk of the plant, forming a tightly fitting case. This\r\nenvelope is composed of thousands of long, strong fibres that, when\r\ncleaned and dried, are the hemp that makes the strongest and best rope\r\nin the world.\r\n\r\nAfter the pulpy leaves are stripped from the stalk, the pulp is squeezed\r\nout of them and the fibres are left in the sun to dry. The best fibre is\r\nas soft and fine as silk. Some of it is used in making a fine cloth; the\r\ncoarser fibre is used for rope and hawsers. More than fifteen million\r\ndollars worth of Manila hemp is sold yearly.\r\n\r\nIn the treaty with Spain, by which Uncle Sam acquired the islands,\r\ntwenty million dollars was paid to Spain. But the exports from the\r\nPhilippines have averaged nearly thirty million dollars a year ever\r\nsince.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\nTHE DUTCH EAST INDIES--JAVA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe East India Islands is a name which embraces nearly all the islands\r\nof the Malay Archipelago, together with the Philippines. The largest of\r\nthese are New Guinea, Borneo, Sumatra, Celebes, and Java. Nearly all of\r\nthem, except the Philippines and parts of New Guinea and Borneo, are\r\ncontrolled by the Dutch. These fertile islands are a source of great\r\nrevenue to the Netherlands; to the rest of the world they are the chief\r\nsource of sugar, spices, and coffee.\r\n\r\nOf all the Dutch East Indies, Java is by far the most beautiful and\r\nproductive; it is a garden of the choicest fruits and flowers.\r\n\r\nThere are two seasons, a wet and a dry. During the wet season the\r\ntorrential rains are accompanied by thunder and lightning. In some parts\r\nof the island more than a hundred thunder-storms occur yearly. The\r\naverage rainfall is from sixty to one hundred and eighty-five inches,\r\nmost of the rain falling on the windward side.\r\n\r\nMany of the streams are perennial, and their waters are conducted away\r\nto be used in irrigation, thus bringing under cultivation nearly every\r\npart of the island. Moreover, the streams themselves hold fertilizing\r\nmaterial much of which has been thrown out by volcanoes. The irrigating\r\nwater itself furnishes sufficient enrichment for the soil, and but very\r\nlittle fertilizing is required. The heat, moisture, and fertile soil,\r\ncoupled with skilful farming, produce bountiful harvests and make the\r\nwhole island a smiling field of verdure and plenty.\r\n\r\nThe hills and mountains in many places are terraced, so that at a\r\ndistance they look like gigantic staircases carpeted with bright green.\r\nSo fertile is the soil that in some places two or three crops are raised\r\neach year.\r\n\r\nAbout one-fourth of the surface is covered with forest. Among the most\r\nvaluable trees is the teak-wood, which is extensively used in\r\nship-building. It is a more durable timber than oak, since it resists\r\ndecay for a long time, even when wholly or partly submerged in sea\r\nwater. There are vessels afloat to-day which were built of teak one\r\nhundred years ago.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants, about thirty million in number, are of the Malay race\r\nand belong to three nations, speaking closely related but different\r\nlanguages--the Sundanese, Javanese, and Mandurese. The island was\r\nwealthy, populous, and had a high degree of civilization long before it\r\nwas known to Europeans.\r\n\r\nLong years ago--twelve hundred or more--the Hindoos invaded the country,\r\nand in the fifteenth century Muhammadans came. They were followed later\r\nby the Dutch who first gained trading concessions and then gradually got\r\npossession of the whole island, much in the same way as England secured\r\nIndia. Each conquest left its impress on the people; the Muhammadans\r\nconverted the natives to their religion. Buddhism preceded the religion\r\nof the great prophet, and some of the teachings of Buddha have been\r\nretained, together with many pagan customs.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch wisely made no effort to Christianize the natives and, until\r\nrecently, they have discouraged all such attempts, believing that they\r\ncould control the people better without disturbing the prevailing\r\nreligious conditions. Indeed, they manage affairs with the natives\r\nwonderfully well.\r\n\r\nThe island is divided into \"residences,\" in each of which the laws are\r\nadministered by a native governor. A Dutch resident is employed by the\r\ncolonial government to assist the native governor--really to see that\r\nhe manages his people justly and fairly, for strict justice has always\r\nbeen observed in dealings with the natives.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A breadfruit tree in Java]\r\n\r\nThe Dutch residents are called \"elder brothers.\" Each resident watches\r\nhis residency with great care to see that the taxes are collected and\r\npaid to the government, and that the natives are treated with justice.\r\nHe is usually the judge who settles all family quarrels and disputes\r\nbetween neighbors. He is just in his judgments and his decisions are\r\nnot questioned. Affairs are managed in much the same way as the \"School\r\nCity\" or the George Settlement in the United States.\r\n\r\nAt the same time the Dutch are very careful to impress their authority\r\non the natives. They require the natives to pay great respect to all\r\nofficers of the colony. A native who comes into the presence of an\r\nofficial must have his head turbaned and his attire in proper form.\r\nUnder no circumstances is he permitted to smoke, chew betel-nut, or\r\nbehave carelessly.\r\n\r\nThe daily work of the natives is very carefully supervised. They are\r\ntaught where to plant, what to plant, and how to plant their crops. The\r\n\"elder brothers\" also see that the crops are cultivated with care and\r\nproperly harvested.\r\n\r\nJava is ruled by a Governor-General and a council appointed by himself.\r\nThe officers are selected because of their fitness, and most of the\r\nsubordinates must pass a civil service examination. Once in the East\r\nIndia service an official is fixed for life, and when he has served his\r\ntime he retires on a pension. Most of the pensioners prefer to remain in\r\nthe island the rest of their lives.\r\n\r\nThe officials and, indeed, all European residents live well. Stone\r\nhouses with marble or tile floors, wide verandas, and large gardens are\r\nthe rule. Breakfast at one o'clock is the substantial meal of the day.\r\nIt marks not the beginning but the end of the day's work. From one to\r\nfive the intense heat keeps every one indoors. At five, official Java\r\nand all other Europeans bathe, dress, and get ready for dinner. After\r\ndinner, driving, calling, and gossiping at the clubs is the proper\r\nthing, and nowhere are people more ceremonious.\r\n\r\nThe natives have but little ambition and no desire to do anything for\r\nthemselves. Now and then there are exceptions, however; and a native may\r\nbe found pegging away at the studies that will enable him to pass the\r\nexaminations and hold an official position.\r\n\r\nAs a whole, the native is gentle and polite and yields ready obedience\r\nto those in authority. He is fond of amusement, feasts, and gambling;\r\nhe, moreover, celebrates every possible event--his marriage, the birth\r\nof his children, the building of his home, the rice harvest, a return\r\nfrom a journey, a recovery from illness, and even the filing of his\r\nteeth. If he, perchance, has not sufficient money to hold the\r\ncelebration, he can join with a neighbor, then both will share mutually\r\nthe expense. On all occasions his deportment is quiet, and whether moved\r\nby joy or anger, no loud language or boisterous laughter is ever heard.\r\n\r\nThe marriageable age of girls is from twelve to fourteen years, and that\r\nof boys sixteen. The night preceding the wedding must be spent by the\r\ncouple in watching, in order to avert subsequent unhappiness, and the\r\nnext day they repair to a mosque and are married according to Muhammadan\r\nrites and customs. To symbolize her total submission to her husband, the\r\nwife washes his feet. Unfortunately, a divorce can be obtained by the\r\nhusband for a trivial cause by the payment of a small fee. A native, on\r\nbeing asked why he got a divorce from his wife, replied, \"She ate too\r\nmuch and I could not afford to keep her.\"\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning the highways are thronged with people on their way\r\nto and from the markets. And the markets?--well, one is certain to find\r\nJohn Chinaman in charge. As a matter of fact, there are more than half a\r\nmillion Chinese in the island, and they have the control of the trade\r\nwith the natives. But the native Javanese trudges along, balancing two\r\nbaskets on a long bamboo pole. Women and girls help to make up the\r\nthrong, and they, too, are laden.\r\n\r\nAt the market pandemonium seems to be loose, and both buyer and seller\r\nare shrieking at the top of their voices over a bargain price. There is\r\nno question as to which wins; the Chinese merchant is there for\r\nbusiness. When the native receives the pay for his produce quite as\r\nlikely as not he makes for the nearest gambling-house and in half an\r\nhour loses the savings of a month.\r\n\r\nTo the natives the greatest terrors are lightning and tigers, both of\r\nwhich claim hundreds of victims each year. They often refrain from\r\nkilling the tigers, since the tigers kill the wild pigs which destroy\r\ntheir crops.\r\n\r\nThe tiger is killed usually by capturing him in a sort of box-trap, and\r\nthen the trap is taken to the nearest stream, where it is submerged and\r\nthe animal drowned, to avoid injury to the skin, which brings a good\r\nprice. The claws and whiskers are carefully removed and sold as\r\nfetiches, since they are considered to be very efficacious.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding their hard lot, the people seem happy and there is no\r\nstarvation poverty. They and their ancestors from time immemorial have\r\nalways worked hard under task-masters and they know of no better\r\ncondition. Since their scanty clothing costs but little, if they can\r\nhave enough to eat and a little amusement occasionally, they are\r\ncontent. When they have money they spend it recklessly, regardless of\r\nthe future. If the needs of the present are supplied, that is\r\nsufficient. When misfortune or disaster overtakes them they merely say:\r\n\"It is the will of God.\"\r\n\r\nThe temples built centuries ago are among the most wonderful structures\r\nin the world. They vie in size and grandeur with those of India.\r\nThousands of these ruined temples are found scattered everywhere over\r\ncentral and eastern Java, and many of them are built on the slopes and\r\nsummits of mountains. These ruins give evidence of the wonderful skill\r\nin sculpture and building attained by the people in by-gone ages, a\r\nskill not excelled even in modern times, but lost to the present\r\ninhabitants.\r\n\r\nThe ruins of the great temple of Boro-Bodor, situated in the\r\nsouth-central part of Java, are among the largest and most striking in\r\nthe world. This temple is square and was built in six terraces or steps\r\non the summit of a hill. The first terrace measures about five hundred\r\nfeet on each side, while each of the five decreases in size toward the\r\ntop. The last one is crowned by a cupola fifty-two feet in diameter,\r\nsurrounded by sixteen smaller ones.\r\n\r\nHere in this great temple of the dead past may be seen scores of\r\nstatues, showing on their countenances the peace of Nirvana. On both\r\ninside and outside of the structure are hundreds of images of Buddha and\r\ncarvings of scenes connected with his life. It is estimated that all of\r\nthe sculptures occupy an extent of wall at least three miles in length.\r\nAll the figures are carved from large blocks of lava.\r\n\r\nThis wonderful temple is built of lava blocks without lime or mortar,\r\nthe huge stones being jointed most accurately by tenons, mortises, and\r\ndovetails which bind them solidly together.\r\n\r\nMany of the temples erected by the Buddhists and Brahmanists were\r\ndestroyed by the Moslem invaders, and others abandoned. All of these\r\nedifices became, during the succeeding centuries, overgrown with the\r\nluxuriant tropical vegetation and partly buried. Some of them, like that\r\nof Boro-Bodor, have been uncovered, displaying hundreds of statues and\r\nlong lines of bas-relief.\r\n\r\nJava is one of the most productive regions of the world, otherwise\r\nthirty millions of people could not live there. The greater part of the\r\nislands consists of government plantations, but there are more than\r\ntwenty thousand private plantations. The Dutch government has built fine\r\nwagon roads and miles of railways, otherwise the great crops of rice,\r\nsugar, coffee, and tea could not be moved to the great trade centres and\r\nseaports. Rice is the chief crop, but so much is consumed that only a\r\nlittle is left for export. The export rice is sold in Borneo. Most of it\r\nis grown on the low coast plains, and these are watered by a net-work of\r\ncanals.\r\n\r\nCoffee is the crop that has made Java famous, and Java coffee is\r\nregarded the best produced. A few years ago it was the custom to sort\r\nthe coffee with great care and then to store it several years in order\r\nto improve the flavor. The coffee thus seasoned was known as \"old\r\ngovernment\" coffee. Much of the crop is now grown by private owners and\r\nis known as \"private plantations\" coffee.\r\n\r\nSugar has become the foremost export crop. Most of it goes to Europe; a\r\nsmall part of it is sent to the refineries of the United States. The\r\ngreat sugar plantations are likewise on the lowlands. Most of the\r\nplantations are owned by wealthy Hollanders, or by Dutch companies. The\r\ncane grows taller than that of the Cuban plantations; usually it is\r\ntwice the height of the native laborers and grows so thickly as to make\r\nthe field like a jungle. It requires a great sum of money to carry on a\r\nsugar plantation, for thousands of dollars must be spent in preparing\r\nthe land.\r\n\r\nBut when one sees the great mills with their ponderous machinery, the\r\nthousands of native workmen, and the train loads of sugar which seem to\r\nbe swallowed by the great steamships, one cannot help thinking that the\r\nsugar-planters make a lot of money in their business. Their homes, many\r\nof them, are beautiful palaces--as costly as can be found anywhere in\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nIndigo is another famous product of Java. The indigo plant would look\r\nlike a rank bunch of weeds were it not planted in rows. The leaves,\r\nwhich contain the coloring matter, are picked two or three times a year\r\nand soaked in water. When they begin to rot, the coloring matter leaves\r\nthe plant and mixes with the water, from which it is afterward\r\nseparated by boiling. The coloring matter itself is called indigo; it is\r\na beautiful blue used for dyeing yarns and cloth. The blue cotton cloth\r\nso much worn by the Dutch peasants is colored with indigo, and both the\r\ncloth and the dye find a market in pretty nearly every country in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Coffee-drying in Java]\r\n\r\nYears ago an enterprising Dutch botanist brought to Java some cinchona\r\ntrees from South America. The experiment was successful and so many\r\ntrees were afterward planted that Java now furnishes about half the\r\nworld's supply of quinine, which is extracted from the bark of the tree.\r\n\r\nTobacco is extensively grown in Java, but one does not hear much about\r\nit, because a great deal of it is sold as \"Sumatra\" leaf. Tea-growing\r\nhas become a great industry in Java and the tea in quality is as fine\r\nas that grown in China. Women and girls are the pickers. They work with\r\nhead and arms bare, each wearing a loose gown resembling a Japanese\r\nkimona without sleeves. As fast as they are picked the leaves are piled\r\non squares of white cloth. When the cloth contains enough to make a\r\nbundle of good size the picker carries it on her head to the factory,\r\nwhere the leaves are first wilted, rolled into compact form and then\r\ndried on great stone floors that are shielded from the sun. The hundreds\r\nof pickers with their brightly colored gowns and white bundles, form a\r\nwonderful kaleidoscope picture.\r\n\r\nIn recent years petroleum, long known to the natives, has added much to\r\nthe wealth of Java. The thrifty Hollander studied well-drilling in\r\nPennsylvania and California; then he put his training to work on the\r\nJavanese oil-fields. As a result Java is beginning to supply not only\r\nthe East Indies, but also Japan with coal-oil.\r\n\r\nYears ago travellers used to tell marvellous stories about a certain\r\npoison valley of Java in the centre of which stood an upas-tree. The\r\ntree itself was famed for the deadly effects of its poisonous\r\nexhalations, which killed man, beast, or bird that came near it. These\r\nstories proved to be mere fabrications. They grew out of the fact that\r\nnear by was a valley from which arose at times carbonic-acid gas in\r\nsufficient quantity to kill small animals running over certain low\r\nplaces. But the upas played no part, though the juice of the tree is\r\npoisonous.\r\n\r\nBatavia is the capital of the Dutch East Indies. It is on low, flat\r\nland, half a dozen miles from the artificial harbor which has not long\r\nbeen finished; for the old port had but little protection from stormy\r\nseas and high winds. The swampy land on which the city is built has been\r\ndrained by canals. Excepting the business streets, the city is almost\r\nhidden by the gardens with their profusion of plants. It is the\r\nAmsterdam of the Old World; and one will find as good wares in Batavia\r\nas in Holland. During the eruption of Krakatoa, Batavia was buried deep\r\nin dust and ragged cinders of lava. More than twenty thousand dead were\r\nunder the heaps of ash.\r\n\r\nSurabaya is larger than Batavia and has a population of more than one\r\nhundred and fifty thousand. But Surabaya has not much trade with Europe;\r\nits commerce is mainly with the ports of Asia. The harbor is good and it\r\nhas become the chief naval station of the Dutch East Indies.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch authorities do not encourage visitors to Java. All visitors\r\nmust have passports or permits; and if one goes to the interior,\r\nofficials question him at every turn and demand his permit at every\r\ndistrict.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\nTHE DUTCH EAST INDIES--SUMATRA AND CELEBES\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo lofty mountain ranges with a deep valley between them lie at the\r\neastern side of the Indian Ocean. The Malay Peninsula is one range; the\r\nisland of Sumatra is the other. The floor of the valley between them is\r\ncovered by the sea and forms the Strait of Malacca.\r\n\r\nAs islands go, Sumatra is of goodly size--larger than New York,\r\nPennsylvania, and the New England States together. From end to end its\r\nlength is about the distance between Boston and Chicago. Greenland,\r\nBorneo, New Guinea, and Madagascar are each larger. The equator crosses\r\nSumatra at its central part.\r\n\r\nSumatra is also a possession of the Dutch East Indies, but it is not\r\nvery important as compared with Java. Although it is three times as\r\nlarge as Java, it has scarcely one-tenth the population. There is a\r\npretty good reason for this. In the first place, the mountainous region\r\nis very rugged and much of it is covered with jungle; therefore, it is\r\nneither habitable nor productive for mankind. In the second place, the\r\nbroad plain on the east side of the island is not well adapted to\r\ncultivation; it is cut by deep river valleys in the higher parts, swampy\r\nin the middle part, and covered with water next the coast during a part\r\nof the year.\r\n\r\nRather singularly the lakes--and there are many--are not in the low,\r\nswampy lands; most of them are high in the mountains. What is still more\r\nsingular, these lakes are the craters of inactive volcanoes. But\r\nSumatra, like Java, has many active volcanoes. One of these, Dempo, is\r\nalmost constantly active. Every now and then it discharges great\r\nquantities of sulphur gases; these are caught by the rain and, falling\r\non the cultivated lands, kill pretty nearly everything touched.\r\n\r\nIn the jungles nature has been very lavish with life. The forests\r\ncontain more than four hundred kinds of trees--among them teak, ebony,\r\ncamphor, and even good pine. Sumatra is also the home of several trees\r\nand plants from which gutta-percha is obtained. Railroads to connect the\r\nforest belts to the coast are the one thing needed to make Sumatra a\r\nlumber-producing country.\r\n\r\nFor some reason or other many of the wild animals that crossed the\r\nshallow water between the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra did not cross the\r\nSunda Strait to Java. There are many more kinds of animals in Sumatra\r\nthan in Java; indeed, nearly all the larger species of wild animals of\r\nsouthern Asia are found in Sumatra, and only a few are in Java. There\r\nare many elephants in the uplands; the rhinoceros lives in the lowlands;\r\nthe tiger lives in the jungle, as in India. The flying \"fox\" is one of\r\nthe curiosities of Sumatra. So much for a name, however, for the animal\r\nis not a fox but a very large bat. Its wings are membranes that connect\r\nthe limbs corresponding to one's fingers. Like other bats, it hangs from\r\nthe limb of a tree, head down, in the daytime, and goes to business at\r\nnight. Its body is not much larger than that of a hare, but when in\r\nflight it is four or five feet from tip to tip.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Natives in the jungle, Sumatra]\r\n\r\nThe flying \"cat\" is likewise a misnamed animal that bears no\r\nrelationship to pussy, but is a kind of lemur. The wild dog, however, is\r\nvery much dog and nuisance at the same time--as much of a nuisance as\r\nthe coyote of the western United States, and far more numerous. The\r\n\"coffee\" rat is likewise a great nuisance wherever found; unfortunately\r\nit is found almost everywhere. Monkeys are also numerous.\r\n\r\nThe natives of Sumatra, like those of Java, are Malays. Unlike them,\r\nhowever, they are difficult to govern; some of the interior tribes are\r\nfierce and warlike. Near the coast, and in places controlled by the\r\nDutch, the native ruler is subject to an \"elder brother\" or Dutch\r\ncommissioner. Most of the tribes of the interior are Muhammadans; they\r\nbelieve that they will be blessed if they are killed in war, and,\r\ntherefore, they take every opportunity to make war. The natives of\r\nAcheen, a province in the northwestern part of the island, have always\r\ngiven the Dutch a great deal of trouble, and they are not fully\r\nconquered, even after a hundred years of warfare.\r\n\r\nOne of the interior tribes, it is thought, came from India several\r\nhundred years ago, for their religion and customs are much the same as\r\nthose of the Hindus. Although they are surrounded by savage tribes, and\r\nfar removed from the civilization, both of India and Europe, they have\r\nreached a remarkable condition of civilization of their own. They are\r\nexcellent farmers and stockmen; they also make firearms, cloth, and\r\njewelry which they sell to the Malay peoples about them.\r\n\r\nThroughout the island the houses are much like those of Malay peoples\r\nelsewhere, with timber frames and thatched roofs. As in the other\r\nislands, they are set on posts wherever floods are likely to occur. The\r\nlarger timbers of many houses are beautifully carved, although many of\r\nthe designs are grotesque and even hideous. All the houses are clustered\r\nin villages. This is done partly for protection against man-eating\r\ntigers, and partly because the people are inclined to social life. The\r\nclub-house is usually to be found in the villages. It is the town hall,\r\nbazaar, market, lounging place, and social club combined. Perhaps a\r\nwedding and a funeral may be going on there at the same time. Men\r\ngamble, and women gossip and chew betel-nut; the peddler likewise shows\r\nhis bargain-counter wares at the club-house.\r\n\r\nThe great plantations of sugar, coffee, and tobacco are managed much the\r\nsame as in Java. The rice-fields are cultivated usually by the Chinese,\r\nand they have much of the trade in the rice. Sumatra is famous for its\r\ntobacco. The plants grow larger and higher than those cultivated in the\r\nUnited States. The leaves are large and the best of them are used as\r\n\"wrappers,\" or outer coverings for fine cigars. Sumatra leaf commands a\r\nhigh price, and a considerable amount of the best tobacco is shipped to\r\nCuba and the United States.\r\n\r\nThe coffee crop is also of excellent quality. Some of it reaches the\r\nmarket as \"Java\" coffee; and, indeed, it is equal to the best coffee\r\ngrown in Java. The beans are large, light in color, and of fine flavor.\r\nCarefully sorted Palembang coffee commands a high price.\r\n\r\nSumatra is famous for its pepper, and not far from one-half the world's\r\nproduct of pepper comes from this island. The plant producing pepper is\r\nnot the pepper-tree so commonly grown for its beautiful foliage and\r\nbright red berries in California and Mexico; it is a vine or climbing\r\nbush. It is commonly planted near to a sapling, around which it twines;\r\nbut in many plantations the plants are pruned and trimmed so that they\r\ngrow unsupported. The pepper of commerce consists of the dried berries\r\nor fruit of the vine. It is the custom to pick the berries as they turn\r\nred. The berries shrivel and turn black as they dry. These, when ground,\r\nare the black pepper of commerce. When fully ripe the color of the berry\r\nturns to a pale yellow and the outer skin is easily removed. The\r\n\"husked\" berries are used for making the white pepper of commerce.\r\n\r\nSago is also an important product of Sumatra. It is the starchy pith of\r\na kind of palm-tree--the sago-palm. The pith is dried, ground to a\r\npowder and washed in order to remove the stringy fibre. In the process\r\nof washing, the starchy granules sink to the bottom, while the woody\r\nfibre floats off.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A jungle, scene in Sumatra]\r\n\r\nThere are several large towns in Sumatra--Siboga, Padang, Benkulen,\r\nTelok Belong, and Palembang--but their names are rarely seen in print or\r\nspoken. The reason is not hard to find; Singapore, just across the\r\nStrait of Malacca, is a free port, with a fine harbor. Vessels from\r\nevery part of the world call at Singapore, and it is much more\r\nconvenient to have the Sumatra products marketed there than to send them\r\nfrom Sumatra ports.\r\n\r\nA few miles to the east of Sumatra are the islands of Banka and\r\nBilliton, famous for their tin mines. These mines produce about\r\ntwo-thirds the world's supply of tin. It is interesting to know that the\r\nsilver-white metal, with which so many of our kitchen utensils are\r\ncoated, has travelled more than half-way around the world to be used,\r\nbut this is probably the case.\r\n\r\nSunda Strait separates Sumatra from Java. In this narrow strait is\r\nsituated the island of Krakatoa, remarkable for one of the most\r\ndestructive volcanic eruptions that have ever occurred. The great\r\neruption was preceded by low rumblings and slight explosions for three\r\nmonths before the volcano burst out in all its fury, on the night of\r\nAugust 26, 1883. The explosions were heard at a distance of many hundred\r\nmiles and over an area equal to one-thirteenth of the earth's surface.\r\nThe entire southern part of the island was blown away and the earth was\r\nshaken for thousands of miles, the shock being recorded as far as South\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nThe upheaval caused a tidal wave one hundred and twenty feet high which,\r\nwith the lava clots and ash ejected, destroyed all of the towns and\r\nplantations bordering on both sides of the straits. In this disaster\r\nmore than forty thousand persons perished and every vestige of animal\r\nand vegetable life in the surrounding region disappeared. The only\r\nperson left to look out upon the scene of destruction was the keeper of\r\nthe light-house, a structure one hundred and thirty feet high, whose\r\nlight the gigantic waves merely succeeded in extinguishing.\r\n\r\nA cubic mile of material is said to have been thrown out in the form of\r\nlapilli and dust by the successive explosions. The dust, estimated to\r\nhave reached the height of several miles, was disseminated by the upper\r\ncurrents of air and caused the brilliant sunsets seen for months in\r\nnearly every part of the civilized world.\r\n\r\nCelebes is the most curiously shaped island in the world. It has a\r\ncentral body from which project four large arms, making it look like a\r\nhuge starfish. These radiating peninsulas are mountain ranges, here and\r\nthere peaked with volcano cinder cones. There are no low-lying marshes;\r\nthe position and high surface render this one of the healthiest islands\r\nin the Malay Archipelago.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch have had settlements here for more than two centuries; and\r\ntheir wise and just treatment of the natives has made the island famous\r\nfor peace and prosperity. Except a few tribes of the interior, all the\r\nislanders are at least partly civilized. The natives who live in the\r\ncoast regions are intelligent and industrious. Paganism and corrupted\r\nMuhammadanism are the prevailing religions, but Christianity has secured\r\na firm hold in a few places. A written language and literature have\r\nprevailed for centuries.\r\n\r\nAll able-bodied men are compelled to work and each year to give a few\r\ndays' labor to keep the excellent roads in good repair; but they reap\r\nthe reward of their industry and are happy and contented.\r\n\r\nThe best coffee land in the East Indies is to be found on this island.\r\nThe most favorable soil for coffee is the rich, black volcanic ash that\r\ncovers the mountain slopes in many parts of north Celebes.\r\n\r\nThe Menado coffee is said to be the finest the world produces.\r\n\r\nThe coffee-trees are allowed to grow to the height of six feet, when the\r\ntops are cut off, so as to strengthen the growth of the lateral branches\r\nwhich bear the fruit.\r\n\r\nBesides a fungus disease, coffee has many other enemies. Both rats and\r\nmice are fond of the juicy stalks of the berries when they are nearly\r\nripe, and they nibble at them until the berries fall. The long-haired\r\nblack rat is the greatest of these pests. Cats are kept on each\r\nplantation to prey upon the animal pests; but, unfortunately, the\r\nnatives are very fond of cats--not as pets, but as articles of food.\r\nThis feline appetite on the part of the workmen causes the owner to keep\r\na vigilant watch over his cat family, and to severely punish any\r\noffender. Perhaps in time they will learn to employ the python as a\r\nrat-catcher, for the python is not surpassed for this purpose.\r\n\r\nThe forest trees are much like those of the adjacent islands. There are\r\nno very large animals, those peculiar to Celebes being the tailless\r\nbaboon and the \"pig-deer,\" which has tusks and curving horns.\r\n\r\nParts of the interior of Celebes still remain unexplored and are said to\r\nbe inhabited by cannibals and head-hunters.\r\n\r\nMacassar is the capital and chief city. It is situated in the southern\r\npart of the southwestern peninsula, and in commerce ranks next to the\r\nlargest cities of Java. Its trade totals upward of three million dollars\r\nannually.\r\n\r\nThe principal exports of the island are coffee, rice, nutmegs, cloves,\r\ndammer, copal, rattan, copra, tobacco, trepang, and tortoise-shell;\r\ncoffee greatly outranking all the other products.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV\r\n\r\nBORNEO AND PAPUA\r\n\r\n\r\nHot, damp, and swampy along the coast lowlands; rugged and fairly\r\npleasant in the high plateau lands--that is Borneo, an island as large\r\nas the State of Texas. Borneo has a great future, however, when a race\r\nof civilized people can be found who can inhabit it, for it is even more\r\nunhealthful than Sumatra.\r\n\r\nBut the wealth is there--diamonds that are rather poor in color, gold,\r\ncopper, iron, coal, and petroleum. That is a good list, and it remains\r\nonly to find a people who can live there and make the great wealth of\r\nthe island available to the world. Perhaps it may be the Japanese--less\r\nlikely the Chinese, for they are content to trade with the natives.\r\nPossibly it may be the Filipinos--for some of the Filipinos, especially\r\nthe Moros, are the descendants of Borneo peoples.\r\n\r\nSafe it is to say that the native tribes will not accomplish this\r\nresult, for they are among the most debased and disgusting savages on\r\nthe face of the earth. Many of these tribes are Malays governed by\r\nchiefs, or dattoes. Some of the tribes near the coast carry on a crude\r\nsort of farming, which is encouraged by the Chinese merchants who buy\r\ntheir produce. Some of the interior tribes just live, being both lazy\r\nand vicious. For food, there is an abundance of bananas and meat. As to\r\nthe meat, it makes little or no difference about the kind; any animal\r\nwhose flesh has become putrid is relished.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting natives of Borneo, however, are the Dyaks, the\r\npeople from whom the Moros of the Philippine Islands are descended. They\r\nare perhaps the most intelligent, but certainly the most troublesome\r\npeoples. They are best known as the \"head-hunters\" of Borneo. Among\r\nthemselves, the one who has killed the greatest number of people is the\r\ngreatest man of the tribe, and the heads of his victims are the\r\ntestimony to his greatness. So the head-hunters kill just for the\r\npleasure of killing, and the heads of their victims are kept as\r\ntrophies. Not all Dyak tribes are head-hunters, however.\r\n\r\nWhen they are not off on head-hunting expeditions, the Dyaks are very\r\nindustrious farmers. They are fond of ornaments. The men of some of the\r\ntribes wear richly embroidered jackets; the women may wear waists made\r\nof fine rattan strung with metal beads and ornaments. They may even wear\r\ncrowns of burnished metal; at all events, they are certain to wear\r\nearrings of astonishing size--perhaps three or four inches across and\r\nmade of solid brass. To hold these pieces of native jewelry the lobes of\r\nthe ears, after they have been pierced, are stretched until they form\r\nloops two inches or more in length.\r\n\r\nThe men also are fond of earrings and similar ornaments, but a real Dyak\r\nswell does not consider himself properly in style until his front teeth\r\nare filed away so that they are notched and shut together like the teeth\r\nof a steel trap. Moreover, he cannot hope to obtain a wife unless he has\r\nat least one head as a trophy.\r\n\r\nIn hunting, the Dyak often makes use of the blow-gun. This weapon, for\r\nshort distances, is about as sure and true as a rifle. It is a wooden\r\ntube four or five feet in length, the bore of which is made very\r\nstraight and smooth. The arrow, or dart, fits the bore of the tube. To\r\nmake sure of the game the tip of the dart is dipped in a most deadly\r\npoison; so that, if it merely breaks the skin of the animal at which it\r\nis shot, it makes a wound that is quickly fatal.\r\n\r\nUnlike most of the natives of the tropical Indies, instead of living in\r\nvillages, the Dyaks frequently live in communal houses. Sometimes twenty\r\nor more families live in the same house, which is not unlike the\r\ncommunal houses of the American Indian, except that it is surrounded by\r\na broad veranda.\r\n\r\nHunting honey in the forests is one of the native sports. The forests of\r\ncertain parts of Borneo seem to be alive with wild bees. As a result,\r\nhoney and wax are very abundant. The honey-bear gets a good share of the\r\nwild honey, for his shaggy hide is proof against the stings of the bees.\r\nThe Dyak hunter has no shaggy coating to protect him; so he goes about\r\nrobbing the bees in a more scientific manner.\r\n\r\nThe bees seem to prefer the mengalis tree, which has so many angles and\r\nhollow places about its trunk that to build the comb is an easy matter.\r\nNot infrequently there may be fifty or more swarms in a single tree.\r\nWhen a bee-tree is to be robbed, great piles of a certain plant or weed\r\nare collected and put in such a position that the smoke will be carried\r\nagainst the nesting-places of the swarms. The piles are then fired. The\r\nsmoke neither kills the bees nor does it drive them off; it merely\r\nstupefies them. When the humming of the bees is hushed, comb and honey\r\nare easily removed. A considerable part of the wax is exported, but\r\nthousands of tons are wasted.\r\n\r\nHunting in the forests of Borneo has its unpleasant features, for the\r\nleeches are almost as numerous as the leaves of the trees. They are big,\r\nfat, ugly-looking slugs, but they can stretch their bodies into a small,\r\nthin form. When waiting for a victim they lengthen and sway their\r\nthreadlike bodies to and fro, ready to launch out at the first\r\nopportunity. So gently do they commence their work that the pricking\r\nsensation is felt only when they are gorged with blood and begin to\r\nloosen their hold.\r\n\r\nThe gathering of edible birds' nests, built by a kind of swallow, is\r\nquite an industry, and is confined to the rocky-cliff sections of\r\ncertain parts of the coast where cover abounds. This species of swallow\r\nis smaller than the common swallow and builds its nest either in the\r\ndark limestone caverns or in the crevices and nooks of the overhanging\r\ncliffs. The chief material used in constructing the nest is a glutinous\r\nsaliva produced by the bird itself. The Chinese are very fond of the\r\nnests, and Chinese merchants buy most of them.\r\n\r\nThe roofs of some of the caves frequented by these swallows are several\r\nhundred feet above their floors, and to reach the nests, scattered over\r\nthe curved roofs and sides, it is necessary to construct ladders and\r\nstages. These are made out of rattan and bamboo and are fastened by pegs\r\ndriven into the limestone walls. Crawling up on these slender supports\r\nwith a candle and forked bamboo pole, the native proceeds to detach the\r\nnests, which he passes to a companion below. When the nests are built\r\nin caves and crevices, near the top of cliffs, a swinging ladder is\r\ndropped from above.\r\n\r\nThere are two kinds of nests, the clear yellowish-white ones, and the\r\ndark ones. The former bring a price as high as twelve dollars per pound;\r\nthe latter only one-tenth as much. The best nests are found in the\r\ndarkest caves.\r\n\r\nBird-nest gathering is a perilous calling, and serious accidents are not\r\ninfrequent. The nests are gathered two or three times a year.\r\n\r\nThe northern part of Borneo is British territory, and the British also\r\ncontrol the States of Sarawak and Brunei; the rest of the island is a\r\npart of the Dutch East Indies. The British are more interested in the\r\nminerals and jungle produce, such as gutta-percha, rattan, rubber, and\r\nbirds' nests, than in the cultivation of plantations. The Dutch, on the\r\nother hand, are trying to establish the great plantations there that\r\nhave made Java famous. Already these are producing great quantities of\r\nsago, tobacco, and sugar.\r\n\r\nThere are no large cities and only a few ports with good harbors, but\r\nGerman steamships make the rounds of the ports and carry the produce to\r\nSingapore, the clearing-house of the East Indies.\r\n\r\nScarcely one hundred and fifty miles north of Australia lies Papua, or\r\nNew Guinea. Next to Greenland it is the largest island in the world, and\r\nin many ways it is the world's wonderland. It was one of the first large\r\nbodies of land discovered after the discovery of America, and one of the\r\nlast to be settled by Europeans. Most likely dry land at one time\r\nconnected Australia and New Guinea, for the animal and plant life of the\r\ntwo are much the same. Even the Great Barrier Reef that skirts the east\r\ncoast of Australia extends part-way around New Guinea.\r\n\r\nOf all the islands southeast of Asia, New Guinea is the most\r\ninteresting. It is rich beyond measure with things useful and\r\nbeautiful. Sugar-cane grows wild from sea to mountain; wild oranges,\r\nlemons, and limes can be had for the picking; and land adapted for\r\ngrowing rice, coffee, tobacco, rubber, cocoanuts, and cinchona is\r\nplentiful. There are mountain summits clad in everlasting snow,\r\nhealthful plateaus abounding in delightful scenery, and dank coast\r\nplains in which lurks the deadly jungle fever.\r\n\r\nDense forests cover most of the island, but the forest trees of the East\r\nIndies are not to be found except here and there in the northwest neck\r\nof the island. The famous eucalyptus abounds in the lowland regions; so\r\nalso does the nipa-palm. Pines, much like the kauri pine of New Zealand,\r\ngrow in the high plateaus. Most singular of all, in the high mountain\r\nregions one may find the alpine plants of Europe, New Zealand, the\r\nAntarctic islands, and the Andine heights of South America. Still\r\nanother strange feature is to be found: while the forest trees are\r\nAustralian kinds, the plants that make the forests a thicket are the\r\nrattans and other jungle plants of India!\r\n\r\nNew Guinea is noted for birds of beautiful plumage, especially birds of\r\nparadise, of which there are many kinds. Among the insects is one\r\ncommonly known as the \"praying\" mantis. It is related to the grasshopper\r\nand is found also in many other parts of the world. In New Guinea the\r\npraying mantis is three or four inches long and at first sight seems to\r\nbe nothing but a broken twig. In various parts of the world it is known\r\nas \"preacher,\" \"nun,\" \"soothsayer,\" and \"saint.\" It has received its\r\nname from the fact that it rests in a sort of kneeling position, holding\r\nits forelegs in a devotional attitude.\r\n\r\nIts character, however, is anything but saintly; it is a most vicious\r\nwretch that may well be called the tiger of the insect world. The\r\ndevotional attitude is the position in which it can best seize its\r\ninsect prey; for when an unsuspecting insect lights on what seems to be\r\na green twig, snap!--those blade-like forelegs armed with sharp spikes\r\ncome together like scissors, and the unlucky victim is cut to pieces in\r\nan instant.\r\n\r\nJohn Chinaman has discovered a use for the praying mantis--a very\r\npractical use, too. John and his near-by friends capture a lot of the\r\ninsects, carry them to a convenient bungalow, turn them loose in a\r\ncockpit, and bet on the survivor. When the insects are turned loose\r\nthere is business on hand, for they go to work at once, cutting one\r\nanother to pieces by the most approved methods of surgical amputation.\r\nThe owner of the survivor wins.\r\n\r\nThe native Papuans much resemble the bushrangers of Australia; they are\r\nNegritos, with black skins and woolly hair. There are a few tribes of\r\nnatives that much resemble the peoples of Samoa and Hawaii; there are\r\nalso other tribes that resemble the Malays of southeastern Asia.\r\n\r\nThe Papuan tribes of the coast are about as degraded as the bushrangers\r\nof Australia. Some of the tribes are cannibals who have a fondness for\r\nsailors that have been wrecked on the shores of New Guinea. They are\r\nneither better nor worse than most of the other tribes of islanders.\r\nLike other islanders, too, they are tractable and easily governed by the\r\nEuropeans who treat them decently. Not very much is known about the\r\ntribes in the interior, except that some of them have neither houses nor\r\nclothing. They live in the trees, and wear no clothing. They are hardly\r\nbetter off than the troops of monkeys, but unlike them eat raw flesh\r\ninstead of fruit and nuts.\r\n\r\nMissionaries have established schools along the coast settlements, and\r\nthe native children trained in these schools make amazing progress. They\r\nlearn to read and write quickly, are neat in dress, and polite in\r\nmanners. Many of the boys who attend the mission schools are trained to\r\nskilled labor on the plantations; some go to the interior as missionary\r\nteachers.\r\n\r\nA few of the Papuan tribes have reached a condition of barbarism much\r\nlike that of the Iroquois Indians in New York when the white men found\r\nthem. They live in houses, some of them four or five hundred feet in\r\nlength. Perhaps thirty or forty families may occupy a single house. The\r\nhouses are divided into apartments, each family living separately.\r\n\r\nIn some of the tribes the men live in a communal house by themselves.\r\nThe women live in small huts, two or three together. They cook the food,\r\nwhich they carry to the communal house; they also do all the work\r\nrequired in cultivating the gardens of yams, bananas, and vegetables.\r\nWar, hunting, and fishing are the only pursuits of the men.\r\n\r\nThree nations, Holland, Great Britain, and Germany, have divided New\r\nGuinea among them. The Dutch have the eastern half of the island. The\r\nBritish and Germans possess each about one-quarter, British New Guinea\r\nbeing situated opposite to Queensland, Australia. The British own the\r\nSolomon Islands to the eastward of New Guinea, also.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch are laying out plantations and teaching the natives to work\r\nthem in the same way that they are managed in Java. The British are busy\r\nexploring the interior, looking especially to the rich mines in their\r\npossession. They have also established a considerable trade in copra,\r\nsago, pearl shell, and cocoa-fibre mats. They are planting rubber-trees,\r\nfor there is no better land in the world for rubber. They have one great\r\nadvantage, namely, the Fly River, which is navigable six hundred miles\r\nfrom its mouth, and opens a trading route far into the interior. Port\r\nMoresby is the trade centre of British New Guinea.\r\n\r\nThe Germans make their share of the island pay expenses by taxing and\r\nlicensing the traders who go there to do business, and they manage to\r\nget a considerable profit out of it. When they find that a trading\r\ncompany is making too much money they buy the company out and carry on\r\nthe business themselves; and this is profitable, too.\r\n\r\nAlthough less is known about New Guinea than almost any other part of\r\nthe earth, enough is known to make it certain that it is one of the most\r\ndesirable bodies of land in the world.",
