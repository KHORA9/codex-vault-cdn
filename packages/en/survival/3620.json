Many parts of them are admirably adapted for giving an insight\r\ninto problems regarding the structure and changes of the earth’s\r\nsurface, and in fact they form a charming introduction to physical\r\ngeology and physiography in their application to special domains. The\r\nbooks themselves cannot be obtained for many times the price of the\r\npresent volume, and both the general reader, who desires to know more\r\nof Darwin’s work, and the student of geology, who naturally wishes to\r\nknow how a master mind reasoned on most important geological subjects,\r\nwill be glad of the opportunity of possessing them in a convenient and\r\ncheap form.\r\n\r\nThe three introductions, which my friend Professor Judd has kindly\r\nfurnished, give critical and historical information which makes this\r\nedition of special value.\r\n\r\nG.T.B.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDETAILED TABLE OF CONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nCRITICAL INTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\nON THE ELEVATION OF THE EASTERN COAST OF SOUTH AMERICA.\r\nUpraised shells of La Plata.—Bahia Blanca, Sand-dunes and\r\nPumice-pebbles.—Step-formed plains of Patagonia, with upraised\r\nshells.—Terrace-bounded valley of Santa Cruz, formerly a\r\nsea-strait.—Upraised shells of Tierra del Fuego.—Length and breadth of\r\nthe elevated area.—Equability of the movements, as shown by the similar\r\nheights of the plains.—Slowness of the elevatory process.—Mode of\r\nformation of the step-formed plains.—Summary.- -Great shingle formation\r\nof Patagonia; its extent, origin, and distribution.—Formation of\r\nsea-cliffs.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\nON THE ELEVATION OF THE WESTERN COAST OF SOUTH AMERICA.\r\nChonos Archipelago.—Chiloe, recent and gradual elevation of, traditions\r\nof the inhabitants on this subject.—Concepcion, earthquake and\r\nelevation of.—VALPARAISO, great elevation of, upraised shells, earth or\r\nmarine origin, gradual rise of the land within the historical\r\nperiod.—COQUIMBO, elevation of, in recent times; terraces of marine\r\norigin, their inclination, their escarpments not horizontal.—Guasco,\r\ngravel terraces of.—Copiapo.—PERU.— Upraised shells of Cobija, Iquique,\r\nand Arica.—Lima, shell-beds and sea- beach on San Lorenzo.—Human\r\nremains, fossil earthenware, earthquake debacle, recent subsidence.—On\r\nthe decay of upraised shells.—General summary.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\nON THE PLAINS AND VALLEYS OF CHILE:—SALIFEROUS SUPERFICIAL DEPOSITS.\r\nBasin-like plains of Chile; their drainage, their marine origin.—Marks\r\nof sea-action on the eastern flanks of the Cordillera.—Sloping\r\nterrace-like fringes of stratified shingle within the valleys of the\r\nCordillera; their marine origin.—Boulders in the valley of\r\nCachapual.—Horizontal elevation of the Cordillera.—Formation of\r\nvalleys.—Boulders moved by earthquake- waves.—Saline superficial\r\ndeposits.—Bed of nitrate of soda at Iquique.— Saline\r\nincrustations.—Salt-lakes of La Plata and Patagonia; purity of the\r\nsalt; its origin.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\nON THE FORMATIONS OF THE PAMPAS.\r\nMineralogical constitution.—Microscopical structure.—Buenos Ayres,\r\nshells embedded in tosca-rock.—Buenos Ayres to the Colorado.—S.\r\nVentana.—Bahia Blanca; M.

The actual writing of this book\r\nappears to have occupied Darwin a shorter period than either of the\r\nother volumes of the series; his diary records that the work was\r\naccomplished within ten months, namely, between July 1844 and April\r\n1845; but the book was not actually issued till late in the year\r\nfollowing, the preface bearing the date “September 1846.” Altogether,\r\nas Darwin informs us in his “Autobiography,” the geological books\r\n“consumed four and a half years’ steady work,” most of the remainder of\r\nthe ten years that elapsed between the return of the “Beagle,” and the\r\ncompletion of his geological books being, it is sad to relate, “lost\r\nthrough illness!”\r\n\r\nConcerning the “Geological Observations on South America,” Darwin wrote\r\nto his friend Lyell, as follows:—“My volume will be about 240 pages,\r\ndreadfully dull, yet much condensed. I think whenever you have time to\r\nlook through it, you will think the collection of facts on the\r\nelevation of the land and on the formation of terraces pretty good.”\r\n\r\n“Much condensed” is the verdict that everyone must endorse, on rising\r\nfrom the perusal of this remarkable book; but by no means “dull.” The\r\nthree and a half years from April 1832 to September 1835, were spent by\r\nDarwin in South America, and were devoted to continuous scientific\r\nwork; the problems he dealt with were either purely geological or those\r\nwhich constitute the borderland between the geological and biological\r\nsciences. It is impossible to read the journal which he kept during\r\nthis time without being impressed by the conviction that it contains\r\nall the germs of thought which afterwards developed into the “Origin of\r\nSpecies.” But it is equally evident that after his return to England,\r\nbiological speculations gradually began to exercise a more exclusive\r\nsway over Darwin’s mind, and tended to dispossess geology, which during\r\nthe actual period of the voyage certainly engrossed most of his time\r\nand attention. The wonderful series of observations made during those\r\nthree and a half years in South America could scarcely be done justice\r\nto, in the 240 pages devoted to their exposition. That he executed the\r\nwork of preparing the book on South America in somewhat the manner of a\r\ntask, is shown by many references in his letters. Writing to Sir Joseph\r\nHooker in 1845, he says, “I hope this next summer to finish my South\r\nAmerican Geology, then to get out a little Zoology, and HURRAH FOR MY\r\nSPECIES WORK!”\r\n\r\nIt would seem that the feeling of disappointment, which Darwin so often\r\nexperienced in comparing a book when completed, with the observations\r\nand speculations which had inspired it, was more keenly felt in the\r\ncase of his volume on South America than any other. To one friend he\r\nwrites, “I have of late been slaving extra hard, to the great\r\ndiscomfiture of wretched digestive organs, at South America, and thank\r\nall the fates, I have done three-fourths of it. Writing plain English\r\ngrows with me more and more difficult, and never attainable. As for\r\nyour pretending that you will read anything so dull as my pure\r\ngeological descriptions, lay not such a flattering unction on my soul,\r\nfor it is incredible.” To another friend he writes, “You do not know\r\nwhat you threaten when you propose to read it—it is purely geological.\r\nI said to my brother, ‘You will of course read it,’ and his answer was,\r\n‘Upon my life, I would sooner even buy it.’”\r\n\r\nIn spite of these disparaging remarks, however, we are strongly\r\ninclined to believe that this book, despised by its author, and\r\nneglected by his contemporaries, will in the end be admitted to be one\r\nof Darwin’s chief titles to fame. It is, perhaps, an unfortunate\r\ncircumstance that the great success which he attained in biology by the\r\npublication of the “Origin of Species” has, to some extent,\r\novershadowed the fact that Darwin’s claims as a geologist, are of the\r\nvery highest order. It is not too much to say that, had Darwin not been\r\na geologist, the “Origin of Species” could never have been written by\r\nhim. But apart from those geological questions, which have an important\r\nbearing on biological thought and speculation, such as the proofs of\r\nimperfection in the geological record, the relations of the later\r\ntertiary faunas to the recent ones in the same areas, and the apparent\r\nintermingling of types belonging to distant geological epochs, when we\r\nstudy the palaeontology of remote districts,—there are other purely\r\ngeological problems, upon which the contributions made by Darwin are of\r\nthe very highest value. I believe that the verdict of the historians of\r\nscience will be that if Darwin had not taken a foremost place among the\r\nbiologists of this century, his position as a geologist would have been\r\nan almost equally commanding one.\r\n\r\nBut in the case of Darwin’s principal geological work—that relating to\r\nthe origin of the crystalline schists,—geologists were not at the time\r\nprepared to receive his revolutionary teachings. The influence of\r\npowerful authority was long exercised, indeed, to stifle his teaching,\r\nand only now, when this unfortunate opposition has disappeared, is the\r\ntrue nature and importance of Darwin’s purely geological work beginning\r\nto be recognised.\r\n\r\nThe two first chapters of the “Geological Observations on South\r\nAmerica,” deal with the proofs which exist of great, but frequently\r\ninterrupted, movements of elevation during very recent geological\r\ntimes. In connection with this subject, Darwin’s particular attention\r\nwas directed to the relations between the great earthquakes of South\r\nAmerica—of some of which he had impressive experience—and the permanent\r\nchanges of elevation which were taking place. He was much struck by the\r\nrapidity with which the evidence of such great earth movements is\r\nfrequently obliterated; and especially with the remarkable way in which\r\nthe action of rain-water, percolating through deposits on the earth’s\r\nsurface, removes all traces of shells and other calcareous organisms.\r\nIt was these considerations which were the parents of the\r\ngeneralisation that a palaeontological record can only be preserved\r\nduring those periods in which long-continued slow subsidence is going\r\non. This in turn, led to the still wider and more suggestive conclusion\r\nthat the geological record as a whole is, and never can be more than, a\r\nseries of more or less isolated fragments. The recognition of this\r\nimportant fact constitutes the keystone to any theory of evolution\r\nwhich seeks to find a basis in the actual study of the types of life\r\nthat have formerly inhabited our globe.\r\n\r\nIn his third chapter, Darwin gives a number of interesting facts,\r\ncollected during his visits to the plains and valleys of Chili, which\r\nbear on the question of the origin of saliferous deposits—the\r\naccumulation of salt, gypsum, and nitrate of soda. This is a problem\r\nthat has excited much discussion among geologists, and which, in spite\r\nof many valuable observations, still remains to a great extent very\r\nobscure. Among the important considerations insisted upon by Darwin is\r\nthat relating to the absence of marine shells in beds associated with\r\nsuch deposits. He justly argues that if the strata were formed in\r\nshallow waters, and then exposed by upheaval to subaerial action, all\r\nshells and other calcareous organisms would be removed by solution.\r\n\r\nFollowing Lyell’s method, Darwin proceeds from the study of deposits\r\nnow being accumulated on the earth’s surface, to those which have been\r\nformed during the more recent periods of the geological history.\r\n\r\nHis account of the great Pampean formation, with its wonderful\r\nmammalian remains—Mastodon, Toxodon, Scelidotherium, Macrauchenia,\r\nMegatherium, Megalonyx, Mylodon, and Glyptodon—this full of interest.\r\nHis discovery of the remains of a true Equus afforded a remarkable\r\nconfirmation of the fact- -already made out in North America—that\r\nspecies of horse had existed and become extinct in the New World,\r\nbefore their introduction by the Spaniards in the sixteenth century.\r\nFully perceiving the importance of the microscope in studying the\r\nnature and origin of such deposits as those of the Pampas, Darwin\r\nsubmitted many of his specimens both to Dr. Carpenter in this country,\r\nand to Professor Ehrenberg in Berlin. Many very important notes on the\r\nmicroscopic organisms contained in the formation will be found\r\nscattered through the chapter.\r\n\r\nDarwin’s study of the older tertiary formations, with their abundant\r\nshells, and their relics of vegetable life buried under great sheets of\r\nbasalt, led him to consider carefully the question of climate during\r\nthese earlier periods. In opposition to prevalent views on this\r\nsubject, Darwin points out that his observations are opposed to the\r\nconclusion that a higher temperature prevailed universally over the\r\nglobe during early geological periods. He argues that “the causes which\r\ngave to the older tertiary productions of the quite temperate zones of\r\nEurope a tropical character, WERE OF A LOCAL CHARACTER AND DID NOT\r\nAFFECT THE WHOLE GLOBE.” In this, as in many similar instances, we see\r\nthe beneficial influence of extensive travel in freeing Darwin’s mind\r\nfrom prevailing prejudices. It was this widening of experience which\r\nrendered him so especially qualified to deal with the great problem of\r\nthe origin of species, and in doing so to emancipate himself from ideas\r\nwhich were received with unquestioning faith by geologists whose\r\nstudies had been circumscribed within the limits of Western Europe.\r\n\r\nIn the Cordilleras of Northern and Central Chili, Darwin, when studying\r\nstill older formations, clearly recognised that they contain an\r\nadmixture of the forms of life, which in Europe are distinctive of the\r\nCretaceous and Jurassic periods respectively. He was thus led to\r\nconclude that the classification of geological periods, which fairly\r\nwell expresses the facts that had been discovered in the areas where\r\nthe science was first studied, is no longer capable of being applied\r\nwhen we come to the study of widely distant regions. This important\r\nconclusion led up to the further generalisation that each great\r\ngeological period has exhibited a geographical distribution of the\r\nforms of animal and vegetable life, comparable to that which prevails\r\nin the existing fauna and flora. To those who are familiar with the\r\nextent to which the doctrine of universal formations has affected\r\ngeological thought and speculation, both long before and since the time\r\nthat Darwin wrote, the importance of this new standpoint to which he\r\nwas able to attain will be sufficiently apparent. Like the idea of the\r\nextreme imperfection of the Geological Record, the doctrine of LOCAL\r\ngeological formations is found permeating and moulding all the\r\npalaeontological reasonings of his great work.\r\n\r\nIn one of Darwin’s letters, written while he was in South America,\r\nthere is a passage we have already quoted, in which he expresses his\r\ninability to decide between the rival claims upon his attention of “the\r\nold crystalline group of rocks,” and “the softer fossiliferous beds”\r\nrespectively. The sixth chapter of the work before us, entitled\r\n“Plutonic and Metamorphic Rocks—Cleavage and Foliation,” contains a\r\nbrief summary of a series of observations and reasonings upon these\r\ncrystalline rocks, which are, we believe, calculated to effect a\r\nrevolution in geological science, and— though their value and\r\nimportance have long been overlooked—are likely to entitle Darwin in\r\nthe future to a position among geologists, scarcely, if at all,\r\ninferior to that which he already occupies among biologists.\r\n\r\nDarwin’s studies of the great rock-masses of the Andes convinced him of\r\nthe close relations between the granitic or Plutonic rocks, and those\r\nwhich were undoubtedly poured forth as lavas. Upon his return, he set\r\nto work, with the aid of Professor Miller, to make a careful study of\r\nthe minerals composing the granites and those which occur in the lavas,\r\nand he was able to show that in all essential respects they are\r\nidentical. He was further able to prove that there is a complete\r\ngradation between the highly crystalline or granitic rock-masses, and\r\nthose containing more or less glassy matter between their crystals,\r\nwhich constitute ordinary lavas. The importance of this conclusion will\r\nbe realised when we remember that it was then the common creed of\r\ngeologists—and still continues to be so on the Continent—that all\r\nhighly crystalline rocks are of great geological antiquity, and that\r\nthe igneous ejections which have taken place since the beginning of the\r\ntertiary periods differ essentially, in their composition, their\r\nstructure, and their mode of occurrence, from those which have made\r\ntheir appearance at earlier periods of the world’s history.\r\n\r\nVery completely have the conclusions of Darwin upon these subjects been\r\njustified by recent researches. In England, the United States, and\r\nItaly, examples of the gradual passage of rocks of truly granitic\r\nstructure into ordinary lavas have been described, and the reality of\r\nthe transition has been demonstrated by the most careful studies with\r\nthe microscope. Recent researches carried on in South America by\r\nProfessor Stelzner, have also shown the existence of a class of highly\r\ncrystalline rocks—the “Andengranites”—which combine in themselves many\r\nof the characteristics which were once thought to be distinctive of the\r\nso-called Plutonic and volcanic rocks. No one familiar with recent\r\ngeological literature—even in Germany and France, where the old views\r\nconcerning the distinction of igneous products of different ages have\r\nbeen most stoutly maintained—can fail to recognise the fact that the\r\nprinciples contended for by Darwin bid fair at no distant period to win\r\nuniversal acceptance among geologists all over the globe.\r\n\r\nStill more important are the conclusions at which Darwin arrived with\r\nrespect to the origin of the schists and gneisses which cover so large\r\nan area in South America.\r\n\r\nCarefully noting, by the aid of his compass and clinometer, at every\r\npoint which he visited, the direction and amount of inclination of the\r\nparallel divisions in these rocks, he was led to a very important\r\ngeneralisation— namely, that over very wide areas the direction\r\n(strike) of the planes of cleavage in slates, and of foliation in\r\nschists and gneisses, remained constant, though the amount of their\r\ninclination (dip) often varied within wide limits. Further than this it\r\nappeared that there was always a close correspondence between the\r\nstrike of the cleavage and foliation and the direction of the great\r\naxes along which elevation had taken place in the district.\r\n\r\nIn Tierra del Fuego, Darwin found striking evidence that the cleavage\r\nintersecting great masses of slate-rocks was quite independent of their\r\noriginal stratification, and could often, indeed, be seen cutting\r\nacross it at right angles. He was also able to verify Sedgwick’s\r\nobservation that, in some slates, glossy surfaces on the planes of\r\ncleavage arise from the development of new minerals, chlorite, epidote\r\nor mica, and that in this way a complete graduation from slates to true\r\nschists may be traced.\r\n\r\nDarwin further showed that in highly schistose rocks, the folia bend\r\naround and encircle any foreign bodies in the mass, and that in some\r\ncases they exhibit the most tortuous forms and complicated puckerings.\r\nHe clearly saw that in all cases the forces by which these striking\r\nphenomena must have been produced were persistent over wide areas, and\r\nwere connected with the great movements by which the rocks had been\r\nupheaved and folded.\r\n\r\nThat the distinct folia of quartz, feldspar, mica, and other minerals\r\ncomposing the metamorphic schists could not have been separately\r\ndeposited as sediment was strongly insisted upon by Darwin; and in\r\ndoing so he opposed the view generally prevalent among geologists at\r\nthat time. He was thus driven to the conclusion that foliation, like\r\ncleavage, is not an original, but a superinduced structure in\r\nrock-masses, and that it is the result of re-crystallisation, under the\r\ncontrolling influence of great pressure, of the materials of which the\r\nrock was composed.\r\n\r\nIn studying the lavas of Ascension, as we have already seen, Darwin was\r\nled to recognise the circumstance that, when igneous rocks are\r\nsubjected to great differential movements during the period of their\r\nconsolidation, they acquire a foliated structure, closely analogous to\r\nthat of the crystalline schists. Like his predecessor in this field of\r\ninquiry, Mr. Poulett Scrope, Charles Darwin seems to have been greatly\r\nimpressed by these facts, and he argued from them that the rocks\r\nexhibiting the foliated structure must have been in a state of\r\nplasticity, like that of a cooling mass of lava. At that time the\r\nsuggestive experiments of Tresca, Daubree, and others, showing that\r\nsolid masses under the influence of enormous pressure become actually\r\nplastic, had not been published. Had Darwin been aware of these facts\r\nhe would have seen that it was not necessary to assume a state of\r\nimperfect solidity in rock-masses in order to account for their having\r\nyielded to pressure and tension, and, in doing so, acquiring the new\r\ncharacters which distinguish the crystalline schists.\r\n\r\nThe views put forward by Darwin on the origin of the crystalline\r\nschists found an able advocate in Mr. Daniel Sharpe, who in 1852 and\r\n1854 published two papers, dealing with the geology of the Scottish\r\nHighlands and of the Alps respectively, in which he showed that the\r\nprinciples arrived at by Darwin when studying the South American rocks\r\nafford a complete explanation of the structure of the two districts in\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nBut, on the other hand, the conclusions of Darwin and Sharpe were met\r\nwith the strongest opposition by Sir Roderick Murchison and Dr. A.\r\nGeikie, who in 1861 read a paper before the Geological Society “On the\r\nCoincidence between Stratification and Foliation in the Crystalline\r\nRocks of the Scottish Highlands,” in which they insisted that their\r\nobservations in Scotland tended to entirely disprove the conclusions of\r\nDarwin that foliation in rocks is a secondary structure, and entirely\r\nindependent of the original stratification of the rock-masses.\r\n\r\nNow it is a most significant circumstance that, no sooner did the\r\nofficers of the Geological Survey commence the careful and detailed\r\nstudy of the Scottish Highlands than they found themselves compelled to\r\nmake a formal retraction of the views which had been put forward by\r\nMurchison and Geikie in opposition to the conclusions of Darwin. The\r\nofficers of the Geological Survey have completely abandoned the view\r\nthat the foliation of the Highland rocks has been determined by their\r\noriginal stratification, and admit that the structure is the result of\r\nthe profound movements to which the rocks have been subjected. The same\r\nconclusions have recently been supported by observations made in many\r\ndifferent districts—among which we may especially refer to those of Dr.\r\nH. Reusch in Norway, and those of Dr. J. Lehmann in Saxony. At the\r\npresent time the arguments so clearly stated by Darwin in the work\r\nbefore us, have, after enduring opposition or neglect for a whole\r\ngeneration, begun to “triumph all along the line,” and we may look\r\nforward confidently to the near future, when his claim to be regarded\r\nas one of the greatest of geological discoverers shall be fully\r\nvindicated.\r\n\r\nJOHN W.

Only those districts and sections will be described in detail\r\nwhich appear to me to deserve some particular attention; and I will, at\r\nthe end of each chapter, give a summary of the results. We will\r\ncommence with the proofs of the upheaval of the eastern coast of the\r\ncontinent, from the Rio Plata southward; and, in the Second Chapter,\r\nfollow up the same subject along the shores of Chile and Peru.\r\n\r\nOn the northern bank of the great estuary of the Rio Plata, near\r\nMaldonado, I found at the head of a lake, sometimes brackish but\r\ngenerally containing fresh water, a bed of muddy clay, six feet in\r\nthickness, with numerous shells of species still existing in the Plata,\r\nnamely, the Azara labiata, d’Orbigny, fragments of Mytilus eduliformis,\r\nd’Orbigny, Paludestrina Isabellei, d’Orbigny, and the Solen Caribaeus,\r\nLam., which last was embedded vertically in the position in which it\r\nhad lived. These shells lie at the height of only two feet above the\r\nlake, nor would they have been worth mentioning, except in connection\r\nwith analogous facts.\r\n\r\nAt Monte Video, I noticed near the town, and along the base of the\r\nmount, beds of a living Mytilus, raised some feet above the surface of\r\nthe Plata: in a similar bed, at a height from thirteen to sixteen feet,\r\nM. Isabelle collected eight species, which, according to M. d’Orbigny,\r\nnow live at the mouth of the estuary. (“Voyage dans l’Amerique Merid.:\r\nPart. Geolog.” page 21.) At Colonia del Sacramiento, further westward,\r\nI observed at the height of about fifteen feet above the river, there\r\nof quite fresh water, a small bed of the same Mytilus, which lives in\r\nbrackish water at Monte Video. Near the mouth of Uruguay, and for at\r\nleast thirty-five miles northward, there are at intervals large sandy\r\ntracts, extending several miles from the banks of the river, but not\r\nraised much above its level, abounding with small bivalves, which occur\r\nin such numbers that at the Agraciado they are sifted and burnt for\r\nlime. Those which I examined near the A. S. Juan were much worn: they\r\nconsisted of Mactra Isabellei, d’Orbigny, mingled with few of Venus\r\nsinuosa, Lam., both inhabiting, as I am informed by M. d’Orbigny,\r\nbrackish water at the mouth of the Plata, nearly or quite as salt as\r\nthe open sea. The loose sand, in which these shells are packed, is\r\nheaped into low, straight, long lines of dunes, like those left by the\r\nsea at the head of many bays. M. d’Orbigny has described an analogous\r\nphenomenon on a greater scale, near San Pedro on the river Parana,\r\nwhere he found widely extended beds and hillocks of sand, with vast\r\nnumbers of the Azara labiata, at the height of nearly 100 feet\r\n(English) above the surface of that river. (Ibid page 43.) The Azara\r\ninhabits brackish water, and is not known to be found nearer to San\r\nPedro than Buenos Ayres, distant above a hundred miles in a straight\r\nline. Nearer Buenos Ayres, on the road from that place to San Isidro,\r\nthere are extensive beds, as I am informed by Sir Woodbine Parish, of\r\nthe Azara labiata, lying at about forty feet above the level of the\r\nriver, and distant between two and three miles from it. (“Buenos Ayres”\r\netc. by Sir Woodbine Parish page 168.) These shells are always found on\r\nthe highest banks in the district: they are embedded in a stratified\r\nearthy mass, precisely like that of the great Pampean deposit hereafter\r\nto be described. In one collection of these shells, there were some\r\nvalves of the Venus sinuosa, Lam., the same species found with the\r\nMactra on the banks of the Uruguay. South of Buenos Ayres, near\r\nEnsenada, there are other beds of the Azara, some of which seem to have\r\nbeen embedded in yellowish, calcareous, semi-crystalline matter; and\r\nSir W. Parish has given me from the banks of the Arroyo del Tristan,\r\nsituated in this same neighbourhood, at the distance of about a league\r\nfrom the Plata, a specimen of a pale- reddish, calcereo-argillaceous\r\nstone (precisely like parts of the Pampean deposit the importance of\r\nwhich fact will be referred to in a succeeding chapter), abounding with\r\nshells of an Azara, much worn, but which in general form and appearance\r\nclosely resemble, and are probably identical with, the A. labiata.\r\nBesides these shells, cellular, highly crystalline rock, formed of the\r\ncasts of small bivalves, is found near Ensenada; and likewise beds of\r\nsea-shells, which from their appearance appear to have lain on the\r\nsurface. Sir W. Parish has given me some of these shells, and M.\r\nd’Orbigny pronounces them to be:—\r\n\r\n1. Buccinanops globulosum, d’Orbigny.\r\n\r\n2. Olivancillaria auricularia, d’Orbigny.\r\n\r\n3. Venus flexuosa, Lam.\r\n\r\n4. Cytheraea (imperfect).\r\n\r\n5. Mactra Isabellei, d’Orbigny.\r\n\r\n6. Ostrea pulchella, d’Orbigny.\r\n\r\nBesides these, Sir W. Parish procured (“Buenos Ayres” etc. by Sir W.\r\nParish page 168.) (as named by Mr. G.B. Sowerby) the following shells:—\r\n\r\n7. Voluta colocynthis.\r\n\r\n8. Voluta angulata.\r\n\r\n9. Buccinum (not spec.?).\r\n\r\nAll these species (with, perhaps, the exception of the last) are\r\nrecent, and live on the South American coast. These shell-beds extend\r\nfrom one league to six leagues from the Plata, and must lie many feet\r\nabove its level. I heard, also, of beds of shells on the Somborombon,\r\nand on the Rio Salado, at which latter place, as M. d’Orbigny informs\r\nme, the Mactra Isabellei and Venus sinuosa are found.\r\n\r\nDuring the elevation of the Provinces of La Plata, the waters of the\r\nancient estuary have but little affected (with the exception of the\r\nsand- hills on the banks of the Parana and Uruguay) the outline of the\r\nland. M. Parchappe, however, has described groups of sand dunes\r\nscattered over the wide extent of the Pampas southward of Buenos Ayres\r\n(D’Orbigny “Voyage Geolog.” page 44.), which M. d’Orbigny attributes\r\nwith much probability to the action of the sea, before the plains were\r\nraised above its level. (Before proceeding to the districts southward\r\nof La Plata, it may be worth while just to state, that there is some\r\nevidence that the coast of Brazil has participated in a small amount of\r\nelevation. Mr. Burchell informs me, that he collected at Santos\r\n(latitude 24 degrees S.) oyster-shells, apparently recent, some miles\r\nfrom the shore, and quite above the tidal action. Westward of Rio de\r\nJaneiro, Captain Elliot is asserted (see Harlan “Med. and Phys. Res.”\r\npage 35 and Dr. Meigs in “Transactions of the American Philosophical\r\nSociety”), to have found human bones, encrusted with sea-shells,\r\nbetween fifteen and twenty feet above the level of the sea. Between Rio\r\nde Janeiro and Cape Frio I crossed sandy tracts abounding with\r\nsea-shells, at a distance of a league from the coast; but whether these\r\ntracts have been formed by upheaval, or through the mere accumulation\r\nof drift sand, I am not prepared to assert. At Bahia (latitude 13\r\ndegrees S.), in some parts near the coast, there are traces of\r\nsea-action at the height of about twenty feet above its present level;\r\nthere are also, in many parts, remnants of beds of sandstone and\r\nconglomerate with numerous recent shells, raised a little above the\r\nsea-level. I may add, that at the head of Bahia Bay there is a\r\nformation, about forty feet in thickness, containing tertiary shells\r\napparently of fresh-water origin, now washed by the sea and encrusted\r\nwith Balini; this appears to indicate a small amount of subsidence\r\nsubsequent to its deposition. At Pernambuco (latitude 8 degrees S.), in\r\nthe alluvial or tertiary cliffs, surrounding the low land on which the\r\ncity stands, I looked in vain for organic remains, or other evidence of\r\nchanges in level.)\r\n\r\nSOUTHWARD OF THE PLATA.\r\n\r\nThe coast as far as Bahia Blanca (in latitude 39 degrees S.) is formed\r\neither of a horizontal range of cliffs, or of immense accumulations of\r\nsand-dunes. Within Bahia Blanca, a small piece of tableland, about\r\ntwenty feet above high-water mark, called Punta Alta, is formed of\r\nstrata of cemented gravel and of red earthy mud, abounding with shells\r\n(with others lying loose on the surface), and the bones of extinct\r\nmammifers. These shells, twenty in number, together with a Balanus and\r\ntwo corals, are all recent species, still inhabiting the neighbouring\r\nseas. They will be enumerated in the Fourth Chapter, when describing\r\nthe Pampean formation; five of them are identical with the upraised\r\nones from near Buenos Ayres. The northern shore of Bahia Blanca is, in\r\nmain part, formed of immense sand-dunes, resting on gravel with recent\r\nshells, and ranging in lines parallel to the shore. These ranges are\r\nseparated from each other by flat spaces, composed of stiff impure red\r\nclay, in which, at the distance of about two miles from the coast, I\r\nfound by digging a few minute fragments of sea-shells. The sand-dunes\r\nextend several miles inland, and stand on a plain, which slopes up to a\r\nheight of between one hundred and two hundred feet. Numerous, small,\r\nwell-rounded pebbles of pumice lie scattered both on the plain and\r\nsand-hillocks: at Monte Hermoso, on the flat summit of a cliff, I found\r\nmany of them at a height of 120 feet (angular measurement) above the\r\nlevel of the sea. These pumice pebbles, no doubt, were originally\r\nbrought down from the Cordillera by the rivers which cross the\r\ncontinent, in the same way as the river Negro anciently brought down,\r\nand still brings down, pumice, and as the river Chupat brings down\r\nscoriae: when once delivered at the mouth of a river, they would\r\nnaturally have travelled along the coasts, and been cast up during the\r\nelevation of the land, at different heights. The origin of the\r\nargillaceous flats, which separate the parallel ranges of sand-dunes,\r\nseems due to the tides here having a tendency (as I believe they have\r\non most shoal, protected coasts) to throw up a bar parallel to the\r\nshore, and at some distance from it; this bar gradually becomes larger,\r\naffording a base for the accumulation of sand- dunes, and the shallow\r\nspace within then becomes silted up with mud. The repetition of this\r\nprocess, without any elevation of the land, would form a level plain\r\ntraversed by parallel lines of sand-hillocks; during a slow elevation\r\nof the land, the hillocks would rest on a gently inclined surface, like\r\nthat on the northern shore of Bahia Blanca. I did not observe any\r\nshells in this neighbourhood at a greater height than twenty feet; and\r\ntherefore the age of the sea-drifted pebbles of pumice, now standing at\r\nthe height of 120 feet, must remain uncertain.\r\n\r\nThe main plain surrounding Bahia Blanca I estimated at from two hundred\r\nto three hundred feet; it insensibly rises towards the distant Sierra\r\nVentana. There are in this neighbourhood some other and lower plains,\r\nbut they do not abut one at the foot of the other, in the manner\r\nhereafter to be described, so characteristic of Patagonia. The plain on\r\nwhich the settlement stands is crossed by many low sand-dunes,\r\nabounding with the minute shells of the Paludestrina australis,\r\nd’Orbigny, which now lives in the bay. This low plain is bounded to the\r\nsouth, at the Cabeza del Buey, by the cliff-formed margin of a wide\r\nplain of the Pampean formation, which I estimated at sixty feet in\r\nheight. On the summit of this cliff there is a range of high sand-dunes\r\nextending several miles in an east and west line.\r\n\r\nSouthward of Bahia Blanca, the river Colorado flows between two plains,\r\napparently from thirty to forty feet in height. Of these plains, the\r\nsouthern one slopes up to the foot of the great sandstone plateau of\r\nthe Rio Negro; and the northern one against an escarpment of the\r\nPampean deposit; so that the Colorado flows in a valley fifty miles in\r\nwidth, between the upper escarpments. I state this, because on the low\r\nplain at the foot of the northern escarpment, I crossed an immense\r\naccumulation of high sand-dunes, estimated by the Gauchos at no less\r\nthan eight miles in breadth. These dunes range westward from the coast,\r\nwhich is twenty miles distant, to far inland, in lines parallel to the\r\nvalley; they are separated from each other by argillaceous flats,\r\nprecisely like those on the northern shore of Bahia Blanca. At present\r\nthere is no source whence this immense accumulation of sand could\r\nproceed; but if, as I believe, the upper escarpments once formed the\r\nshores of an estuary, in that case the sandstone formation of the river\r\nNegro would have afforded an inexhaustible supply of sand, which would\r\nnaturally have accumulated on the northern shore, as on every part of\r\nthe coast open to the south winds between Bahia Blanca and Buenos\r\nAyres.\r\n\r\nAt San Blas (40 degrees 40′ S.) a little south of the mouth of the\r\nColorado, M. d’Orbigny found fourteen species of existing shells (six\r\nof them identical with those from Bahia Blanca), embedded in their\r\nnatural positions. (“Voyage” etc. page 54.) From the zone of depth\r\nwhich these shells are known to inhabit, they must have been uplifted\r\nthirty-two feet. He also found, at from fifteen to twenty feet above\r\nthis bed, the remains of an ancient beach.\r\n\r\nTen miles southward, but 120 miles to the west, at Port S. Antonio, the\r\nOfficers employed on the Survey assured me that they saw many old sea-\r\nshells strewed on the surface of the ground, similar to those found on\r\nother parts of the coast of Patagonia. At San Josef, ninety miles south\r\nin nearly the same longitude, I found, above the gravel, which caps an\r\nold tertiary formation, an irregular bed and hillock of sand, several\r\nfeet in thickness, abounding with shells of Patella deaurita, Mytilus\r\nMagellanicus, the latter retaining much of its colour; Fusus\r\nMagellanicus (and a variety of the same), and a large Balanus (probably\r\nB. Tulipa), all now found on this coast: I estimated this bed at from\r\neighty to one hundred feet above the level of the sea. To the westward\r\nof this bay, there is a plain estimated at between two hundred and\r\nthree hundred feet in height: this plain seems, from many measurements,\r\nto be a continuation of the sandstone platform of the river Negro. The\r\nnext place southward, where I landed, was at Port Desire, 340 miles\r\ndistant; but from the intermediate districts I received, through the\r\nkindness of the Officers of the Survey, especially from Lieutenant\r\nStokes and Mr. King, many specimens and sketches, quite sufficient to\r\nshow the general uniformity of the whole line of coast. I may here\r\nstate, that the whole of Patagonia consists of a tertiary formation,\r\nresting on and sometimes surrounding hills of porphyry and quartz: the\r\nsurface is worn into many wide valleys and into level step-formed\r\nplains, rising one above another, all capped by irregular beds of\r\ngravel, chiefly composed of porphyritic rocks. This gravel formation\r\nwill be separately described at the end of the chapter.\r\n\r\nMy object in giving the following measurements of the plains, as taken\r\nby the Officers of the Survey, is, as will hereafter be seen, to show\r\nthe remarkable equability of the recent elevatory movements. Round the\r\nsouthern parts of Nuevo Gulf, as far as the River Chupat (seventy miles\r\nsouthward of San Josef), there appear to be several plains, of which\r\nthe best defined are here represented.\r\n\r\n(In the following Diagrams: 1. Baseline is Level of sea. 2. Scale is\r\n1/20 of inch to 100 feet vertical. 3. Height is shown in feet thus: An.\r\nM. always stands for angular or trigonometrical measurement. Ba.

M.)\r\n\r\nThe upper plain is here well defined (called Table Hills); its edge\r\nforms a cliff or line of escarpment many miles in length, projecting\r\nover a lower plain. The lowest plain corresponds with that at San Josef\r\nwith the recent shells on its surface. Between this lowest and the\r\nuppermost plain, there is probably more than one step-formed terrace:\r\nseveral measurements show the existence of the intermediate one of the\r\nheight given in Diagram 1.\r\n\r\n(DIAGRAM 2.

Terraces 4, 5 and 6 not measured.\r\nTerrace 7. 1,200 Est.)\r\n\r\nNear the north headland of the great Bay of St. George (100 miles south\r\nof the Chupat), two well-marked plains of 250 and 330 feet were\r\nmeasured: these are said to sweep round a great part of the Bay. At its\r\nsouth headland, 120 miles distant from the north headland, the 250 feet\r\nplain was again measured. In the middle of the bay, a higher plain was\r\nfound at two neighbouring places (Tilli Roads and C. Marques) to be 580\r\nfeet in height. Above this plain, towards the interior, Mr. Stokes\r\ninforms me that there were several other step-formed plains, the\r\nhighest of which was estimated at 1,200 feet, and was seen ranging at\r\napparently the same height for 150 miles northward. All these plains\r\nhave been worn into great valleys and much denuded. The section in\r\nDiagram 3 is illustrative of the general structure of the great Bay of\r\nSt. George. At the south headland of the Bay of St. George (near C.\r\nThree Points) the 250 plain is very extensive.\r\n\r\n(DIAGRAM 3.

Terrace 4. Not measured.)\r\n\r\nAt Port Desire (forty miles southward) I made several measurements with\r\nthe barometer of a plain, which extends along the north side of the\r\nport and along the open coast, and which varies from 245 to 255 feet in\r\nheight: this plain abuts against the foot of a higher plain of 330\r\nfeet, which extends also far northward along the coast, and likewise\r\ninto the interior. In the distance a higher inland platform was seen,\r\nof which I do not know the height. In three separate places, I observed\r\nthe cliff of the 245-255 feet plain, fringed by a terrace or narrow\r\nplain estimated at about one hundred feet in height. These plains are\r\nrepresented in the section Diagram 3.\r\n\r\nIn many places, even at the distance of three and four miles from the\r\ncoast, I found on the gravel-capped surface of the 245-255 feet, and of\r\nthe 330 feet plain, shells of Mytilus Magellanicus, M. edulis, Patella\r\ndeaurita, and another Patella, too much worn to be identified, but\r\napparently similar to one found abundantly adhering to the leaves of\r\nthe kelp. These species are the commonest now living on this coast. The\r\nshells all appeared very old; the blue of the mussels was much faded;\r\nand only traces of colour could be perceived in the Patellas, of which\r\nthe outer surfaces were scaling off. They lay scattered on the smooth\r\nsurface of the gravel, but abounded most in certain patches, especially\r\nat the heads of the smaller valleys: they generally contained sand in\r\ntheir insides; and I presume that they have been washed by alluvial\r\naction out of thin sandy layers, traces of which may sometimes be seen\r\ncovering the gravel. The several plains have very level surfaces; but\r\nall are scooped out by numerous broad, winding, flat-bottomed valleys,\r\nin which, judging from the bushes, streams never flow. These remarks on\r\nthe state of the shells, and on the nature of the plains, apply to the\r\nfollowing cases, so need not be repeated.\r\n\r\n(DIAGRAM 4. SECTION OF PLAINS AT PORT S. JULIAN.\r\n\r\nFrom East (sea level) to West (high): Terrace 1. Shells on surface. 90\r\nEst. Terrace 2. 430 An. M. Terrace 3. 560 An. M. Terrace 4. 950 An. M.)\r\n\r\nSouthward of Port Desire, the plains have been greatly denuded, with\r\nonly small pieces of tableland marking their former extension. But\r\nopposite Bird Island, two considerable step-formed plains were\r\nmeasured, and found respectively to be 350 and 590 feet in height. This\r\nlatter plain extends along the coast close to Port St. Julian (110\r\nmiles south of Port Desire); see Diagram 4.\r\n\r\nThe lowest plain was estimated at ninety feet: it is remarkable from\r\nthe usual gravel-bed being deeply worn into hollows, which are filled\r\nup with, as well as the general surface covered by, sandy and reddish\r\nearthy matter: in one of the hollows thus filled up, the skeleton of\r\nthe Macrauchenia Patachonica, as will hereafter be described, was\r\nembedded. On the surface and in the upper parts of this earthy mass,\r\nthere were numerous shells of Mytilus Magellanicus and M. edulis,\r\nPatella deaurita, and fragments of other species. This plain is\r\ntolerably level, but not extensive; it forms a promontory seven or\r\neight miles long, and three or four wide. The upper plains in Diagram 4\r\nwere measured by the Officers of the Survey; they were all capped by\r\nthick beds of gravel, and were all more or less denuded; the 950 plain\r\nconsists merely of separate, truncated, gravel-capped hills, two of\r\nwhich, by measurement, were found to differ only three feet. The 430\r\nfeet plain extends, apparently with hardly a break, to near the\r\nnorthern entrance of the Rio Santa Cruz (fifty miles to the south); but\r\nit was there found to be only 330 feet in height.\r\n\r\n(DIAGRAM 5.

Terrace 3. 840 An.\r\nM.)\r\n\r\nOn the southern side of the mouth of the Santa Cruz we have Diagram 5,\r\nwhich I am able to give with more detail than in the foregoing cases.\r\n\r\nThe plain marked 355 feet (as ascertained by the barometer and by\r\nangular measurement) is a continuation of the above-mentioned 330 feet\r\nplain: it extends in a N.W. direction along the southern shores of the\r\nestuary. It is capped by gravel, which in most parts is covered by a\r\nthin bed of sandy earth, and is scooped out by many flat-bottomed\r\nvalleys. It appears to the eye quite level, but in proceeding in a\r\nS.S.W. course, towards an escarpment distant about six miles, and\r\nlikewise ranging across the country in a N.W. line, it was found to\r\nrise at first insensibly, and then for the last half-mile, sensibly,\r\nclose up to the base of the escarpment: at this point it was 463 feet\r\nin height, showing a rise of 108 feet in the six miles. On this 355-463\r\nfeet plain, I found several shells of Mytilus Magellanicus and of a\r\nMytilus, which Mr. Sowerby informs me is yet unnamed, though well-known\r\nas recent on this coast; Patella deaurita; Fusus, I believe,\r\nMagellanicus, but the specimen has been lost; and at the distance of\r\nfour miles from the coast, at the height of about four hundred feet,\r\nthere were fragments of the same Patella and of a Voluta (apparently V.\r\nancilla) partially embedded in the superficial sandy earth. All these\r\nshells had the same ancient appearance with those from the foregoing\r\nlocalities. As the tides along this part of the coast rise at the\r\nSyzygal period forty feet, and therefore form a well-marked beach-line,\r\nI particularly looked out for ridges in crossing this plain, which, as\r\nwe have seen, rises 108 feet in about six miles, but I could not see\r\nany traces of such. The next highest plain is 710 feet above the sea;\r\nit is very narrow, but level, and is capped with gravel; it abuts to\r\nthe foot of the 840 feet plain. This summit-plain extends as far as the\r\neye can range, both inland along the southern side of the valley of the\r\nSanta Cruz, and southward along the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nTHE VALLEY OF THE R. SANTA CRUZ.\r\n\r\nThis valley runs in an east and west direction to the Cordillera, a\r\ndistance of about one hundred and sixty miles. It cuts through the\r\ngreat Patagonian tertiary formation, including, in the upper half of\r\nthe valley, immense streams of basaltic lava, which as well as the\r\nsofter beds, are capped by gravel; and this gravel, high up the river,\r\nis associated with a vast boulder formation. (I have described this\r\nformation in a paper in the “Geological Transactions” volume 6 page\r\n415.) In ascending the valley, the plain which at the mouth on the\r\nsouthern side is 355 feet high, is seen to trend towards the\r\ncorresponding plain on the northern side, so that their escarpments\r\nappear like the shores of a former estuary, larger than the existing\r\none: the escarpments, also, of the 840 feet summit-plain (with a\r\ncorresponding northern one, which is met with some way up the valley),\r\nappear like the shores of a still larger estuary. Farther up the\r\nvalley, the sides are bounded throughout its entire length by level,\r\ngravel-capped terraces, rising above each other in steps. The width\r\nbetween the upper escarpments is on an average between seven and ten\r\nmiles; in one spot, however, where cutting through the basaltic lava,\r\nit was only one mile and a half. Between the escarpments of the second\r\nhighest terrace the average width is about four or five miles. The\r\nbottom of the valley, at the distance of 110 miles from its mouth,\r\nbegins sensibly to expand, and soon forms a considerable plain, 440\r\nfeet above the level of the sea, through which the river flows in a gut\r\nfrom twenty to forty feet in depth. I here found, at a point 140 miles\r\nfrom the Atlantic, and seventy miles from the nearest creek of the\r\nPacific, at the height of 410 feet, a very old and worn shell of\r\nPatella deaurita. Lower down the valley, 105 miles from the Atlantic\r\n(longitude 71 degrees W.), and at an elevation of about 300 feet, I\r\nalso found, in the bed of the river, two much worn and broken shells of\r\nthe Voluta ancilla, still retaining traces of their colours; and one of\r\nthe Patella deaurita. It appeared that these shells had been washed\r\nfrom the banks into the river; considering the distance from the sea,\r\nthe desert and absolutely unfrequented character of the country, and\r\nthe very ancient appearance of the shells (exactly like those found on\r\nthe plains nearer the coast), there is, I think, no cause to suspect\r\nthat they could have been brought here by Indians.\r\n\r\nThe plain at the head of the valley is tolerably level, but water-worn,\r\nand with many sand-dunes on it like those on a sea-coast. At the\r\nhighest point to which we ascended, it was sixteen miles wide in a\r\nnorth and south line; and forty-five miles in length in an east and\r\nwest line. It is bordered by the escarpments, one above the other, of\r\ntwo plains, which diverge as they approach the Cordillera, and\r\nconsequently resemble, at two levels, the shores of great bays facing\r\nthe mountains; and these mountains are breached in front of the lower\r\nplain by a remarkable gap. The valley, therefore, of the Santa Cruz\r\nconsists of a straight broad cut, about ninety miles in length,\r\nbordered by gravel-capped terraces and plains, the escarpments of which\r\nat both ends diverge or expand, one over the other, after the manner of\r\nthe shores of great bays. Bearing in mind this peculiar form of the\r\nland—the sand-dunes on the plain at the head of the valley—the gap in\r\nthe Cordillera, in front of it—the presence in two places of very\r\nancient shells of existing species—and lastly, the circumstance of the\r\n355-453 feet plain, with the numerous marine remains on its surface,\r\nsweeping from the Atlantic coast, far up the valley, I think we must\r\nadmit, that within the recent period, the course of the Santa Cruz\r\nformed a sea-strait intersecting the continent. At this period, the\r\nsouthern part of South America consisted of an archipelago of islands\r\n360 miles in a north and south line. We shall presently see, that two\r\nother straits also, since closed, then cut through Tierra del Fuego; I\r\nmay add, that one of them must at that time have expanded at the foot\r\nof the Cordillera into a great bay (now Otway Water) like that which\r\nformerly covered the 440 feet plain at the head of the Santa Cruz.\r\n\r\n(DIAGRAM 6. NORTH AND SOUTH SECTION ACROSS THE TERRACES BOUNDING THE\r\nVALLEY OF THE RIVER SANTA CRUZ, HIGH UP ITS COURSE.\r\n\r\nThe height of each terrace, above the level of the river (furthest to\r\nnearest to the river) in feet:\r\n\r\nA, north and south: 1,122 B, north and south: 869 C, north and south:\r\n639 D, north: not measured. D, north? (suggest south): 185 E: 20 Bed of\r\nRiver.\r\n\r\nVertical scale 1/20 of inch to 100 feet; but terrace E, being only\r\ntwenty feet above the river, has necessarily been raised. The\r\nhorizontal distances much contracted; the distance from the edge of A\r\nNorth to A South being on an average from seven to ten miles.) I have\r\nsaid that the valley in its whole course is bordered by gravel- capped\r\nplains. The section (Diagram 6), supposed to be drawn in a north and\r\nsouth line across the valley, can scarcely be considered as more than\r\nillustrative; for during our hurried ascent it was impossible to\r\nmeasure all the plains at any one place. At a point nearly midway\r\nbetween the Cordillera and the Atlantic, I found the plain (A north)\r\n1,122 feet above the river; all the lower plains on this side were here\r\nunited into one great broken cliff: at a point sixteen miles lower down\r\nthe stream, I found by measurement and estimation that B (north) was\r\n869 above the river: very near to where A (north) was measured, C\r\n(north) was 639 above the same level: the terrace D (north) was nowhere\r\nmeasured: the lowest E (north) was in many places about twenty feet\r\nabove the river. These plains or terraces were best developed where the\r\nvalley was widest; the whole five, like gigantic steps, occurred\r\ntogether only at a few points. The lower terraces are less continuous\r\nthan the higher ones, and appear to be entirely lost in the upper third\r\nof the valley. Terrace C (south), however was traced continuously for a\r\ngreat distance. The terrace B (north), at a point fifty- five miles\r\nfrom the mouth of the river, was four miles in width; higher up the\r\nvalley this terrace (or at least the second highest one, for I could\r\nnot always trace it continuously) was about eight miles wide. This\r\nsecond plain was generally wider than the lower ones—as indeed follows\r\nfrom the valley from A (north) to A (south) being generally nearly\r\ndouble the width of from B (north) to B (south). Low down the valley,\r\nthe summit-plain A (south) is continuous with the 840 feet plain on the\r\ncoast, but it is soon lost or unites with the escarpment of B (south).\r\nThe corresponding plain A (north), on the north side of the valley,\r\nappears to range continuously from the Cordillera to the head of the\r\npresent estuary of the Santa Cruz, where it trends northward towards\r\nPort St. Julian. Near the Cordillera the summit-plain on both sides of\r\nthe valley is between 3,200 and 3,300 feet in height; at 100 miles from\r\nthe Atlantic, it is 1,416 feet, and on the coast 840 feet, all above\r\nthe sea-beach; so that in a distance of 100 miles the plain rises 576\r\nfeet, and much more rapidly near to the Cordillera. The lower terraces\r\nB and C also appear to rise as they run up the valley; thus D (north),\r\nmeasured at two points twenty-four miles apart, was found to have risen\r\n185 feet. From several reasons I suspect, that this gradual inclination\r\nof the plains up the valley, has been chiefly caused by the elevation\r\nof the continent in mass, having been the greater the nearer to the\r\nCordillera.\r\n\r\nAll the terraces are capped with well-rounded gravel, which rests\r\neither on the denuded and sometimes furrowed surface of the soft\r\ntertiary deposits, or on the basaltic lava. The difference in height\r\nbetween some of the lower steps or terraces seems to be entirely owing\r\nto a difference in the thickness of the capping gravel. Furrows and\r\ninequalities in the gravel, where such occur, are filled up and\r\nsmoothed over with sandy earth. The pebbles, especially on the higher\r\nplains, are often whitewashed, and even cemented together by a white\r\naluminous substance, and I occasionally found this to be the case with\r\nthe gravel on the terrace D. I could not perceive any trace of a\r\nsimilar deposition on the pebbles now thrown up by the river, and\r\ntherefore I do not think that terrace D was river-formed. As the\r\nterrace E generally stands about twenty feet above the bed of the\r\nriver, my first impression was to doubt whether even this lowest one\r\ncould have been so formed; but it should always be borne in mind, that\r\nthe horizontal upheaval of a district, by increasing the total descent\r\nof the streams, will always tend to increase, first near the sea-coast\r\nand then further and further up the valley, their corroding and\r\ndeepening powers: so that an alluvial plain, formed almost on a level\r\nwith a stream, will, after an elevation of this kind, in time be cut\r\nthrough, and left standing at a height never again to be reached by the\r\nwater. With respect to the three upper terraces of the Santa Cruz, I\r\nthink there can be no doubt, that they were modelled by the sea, when\r\nthe valley was occupied by a strait, in the same manner (hereafter to\r\nbe discussed) as the greater step-formed, shell- strewed plains along\r\nthe coast of Patagonia.\r\n\r\nTo return to the shores of the Atlantic: the 840 feet plain, at the\r\nmouth of the Santa Cruz, is seen extending horizontally far to the\r\nsouth; and I am informed by the Officers of the Survey, that bending\r\nround the head of Coy Inlet (sixty-five miles southward), it trends\r\ninland. Outliers of apparently the same height are seen forty miles\r\nfarther south, inland of the river Gallegos; and a plain comes down to\r\nCape Gregory (thirty-five miles southward), in the Strait of Magellan,\r\nwhich was estimated at between eight hundred and one thousand feet in\r\nheight, and which, rising towards the interior, is capped by the\r\nboulder formation. South of the Strait of Magellan, there are large\r\noutlying masses of apparently the same great tableland, extending at\r\nintervals along the eastern coast of Tierra del Fuego: at two places\r\nhere, 110 miles a part, this plain was found to be 950 and 970 feet in\r\nheight.\r\n\r\nFrom Coy Inlet, where the high summit-plain trends inland, a plain\r\nestimated at 350 feet in height, extends for forty miles to the river\r\nGallegos. From this point to the Strait of Magellan, and on each side\r\nof that Strait, the country has been much denuded and is less level. It\r\nconsists chiefly of the boulder formation, which rises to a height of\r\nbetween one hundred and fifty and two hundred and fifty feet, and is\r\noften capped by beds of gravel. At N.S. Gracia, on the north side of\r\nthe Inner Narrows of the Strait of Magellan, I found on the summit of a\r\ncliff, 160 feet in height, shells of existing Patellae and Mytili,\r\nscattered on the surface and partially embedded in earth. On the\r\neastern coast, also, of Tierra del Fuego, in latitude 53 degrees 20′\r\nsouth, I found many Mytili on some level land, estimated at 200 feet in\r\nheight. Anterior to the elevation attested by these shells, it is\r\nevident by the present form of the land, and by the distribution of the\r\ngreat erratic boulders on the surface, that two sea-channels connected\r\nthe Strait of Magellan both with Sebastian Bay and with Otway Water.\r\n(“Geological Transactions” volume 6 page 419.)\r\n\r\nCONCLUDING REMARKS ON THE RECENT ELEVATION OF THE SOUTH-EASTERN COASTS\r\nOF AMERICA, AND ON THE ACTION OF THE SEA ON THE LAND.\r\n\r\nUpraised shells of species, still existing as the commonest kinds in\r\nthe adjoining sea, occur, as we have seen, at heights of between a few\r\nfeet and 410 feet, at intervals from latitude 33 degrees 40′ to 53\r\ndegrees 20′ south. This is a distance of 1,180 geographical miles—about\r\nequal from London to the North Cape of Sweden. As the boulder formation\r\nextends with nearly the same height 150 miles south of 53 degrees 20′,\r\nthe most southern point where I landed and found upraised shells; and\r\nas the level Pampas ranges many hundred miles northward of the point,\r\nwhere M. d’Orbigny found at the height of 100 feet beds of the Azara,\r\nthe space in a north and south line, which has been uplifted within the\r\nrecent period, must have been much above the 1,180 miles. By the term\r\n“recent,” I refer only to that period within which the now living\r\nmollusca were called into existence; for it will be seen in the Fourth\r\nChapter, that both at Bahia Blanca and P. S. Julian, the mammiferous\r\nquadrupeds which co-existed with these shells belong to extinct\r\nspecies. I have said that the upraised shells were found only at\r\nintervals on this line of coast, but this in all probability may be\r\nattributed to my not having landed at the intermediate points; for\r\nwherever I did land, with the exception of the river Negro, shells were\r\nfound: moreover, the shells are strewed on plains or terraces, which,\r\nas we shall immediately see, extend for great distances with a uniform\r\nheight. I ascended the higher plains only in a few places, owing to the\r\ndistance at which their escarpments generally range from the coast, so\r\nthat I am far from knowing that 410 feet is the maximum of elevation of\r\nthese upraised remains. The shells are those now most abundant in a\r\nliving state in the adjoining sea. (Captain King “Voyages of\r\n‘Adventure’ and ‘Beagle’” volume 1 pages 6 and 133.) All of them have\r\nan ancient appearance; but some, especially the mussels, although lying\r\nfully exposed to the weather, retain to a considerable extent their\r\ncolours: this circumstance appears at first surprising, but it is now\r\nknown that the colouring principle of the Mytilus is so enduring, that\r\nit is preserved when the shell itself is completely disintegrated. (See\r\nMr. Lyell “Proofs of a Gradual Rising in Sweden” in the “Philosophical\r\nTransactions” 1835 page 1. See also Mr. Smith of Jordan Hill in the\r\n“Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal” volume 25 page 393.) Most of the\r\nshells are broken; I nowhere found two valves united; the fragments are\r\nnot rounded, at least in none of the specimens which I brought home.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the breadth of the upraised area in an east and west\r\nline, we know from the shells found at the Inner Narrows of the Strait\r\nof Magellan, that the entire width of the plain, although there very\r\nnarrow, has been elevated. It is probable that in this southernmost\r\npart of the continent, the movement has extended under the sea far\r\neastward; for at the Falkland Islands, though I could not find any\r\nshells, the bones of whales have been noticed by several competent\r\nobservers, lying on the land at a considerable distance from the sea,\r\nand at the height of some hundred feet above it. (“Voyages of the\r\n‘Adventure’ and ‘Beagle’” volume 2 page 227. And Bougainville’s\r\n“Voyage” tome 1 page 112.) Moreover, we know that in Tierra del Fuego\r\nthe boulder formation has been uplifted within the recent period, and a\r\nsimilar formation occurs on the north-western shores (Byron Sound) of\r\nthese islands. (I owe this fact to the kindness of Captain Sulivan,\r\nR.N., a highly competent observer. I mention it more especially, as in\r\nmy Paper (page 427) on the Boulder Formation, I have, after having\r\nexamined the northern and middle parts of the eastern island, said that\r\nthe formation was here wholly absent.) The distance from this point to\r\nthe Cordillera of Tierra del Fuego, is 360 miles, which we may take as\r\nthe probable width of the recently upraised area. In the latitude of\r\nthe R. Santa Cruz, we know from the shells found at the mouth and head,\r\nand in the middle of the valley, that the entire width (about 160\r\nmiles) of the surface eastward of the Cordillera has been upraised.\r\nFrom the slope of the plains, as shown by the course of the rivers, for\r\nseveral degrees northward of the Santa Cruz, it is probable that the\r\nelevation attested by the shells on the coast has likewise extended to\r\nthe Cordillera. When, however, we look as far northward as the\r\nprovinces of La Plata, this conclusion would be very hazardous; not\r\nonly is the distance from Maldonado (where I found upraised shells) to\r\nthe Cordillera great, namely, 760 miles, but at the head of the estuary\r\nof the Plata, a N.N.E. and S.S.W. range of tertiary volcanic rocks has\r\nbeen observed (This volcanic formation will be described in Chapter IV.\r\nIt is not improbable that the height of the upraised shells at the head\r\nof the estuary of the Plata, being greater than at Bahia Blanca or at\r\nSan Blas, may be owing to the upheaval of these latter places having\r\nbeen connected with the distant line of the Cordillera, whilst that of\r\nthe provinces of La Plata was in connection with the adjoining tertiary\r\nvolcanic axis.), which may well indicate an axis of elevation quite\r\ndistinct from that of the Andes. Moreover, in the centre of the Pampas\r\nin the chain of Cordova, severe earthquakes have been felt (See Sir W.\r\nParish’s work on “La Plata” page 242. For a notice of an earthquake\r\nwhich drained a lake near Cordova, see also Temple’s “Travels in Peru.”\r\nSir W. Parish informs me, that a town between Salta and Tucuman (north\r\nof Cordova) was formerly utterly overthrown by an earthquake.); whereas\r\nat Mendoza, at the eastern foot of the Cordillera, only gentle\r\noscillations, transmitted from the shores of the Pacific, have ever\r\nbeen experienced. Hence the elevation of the Pampas may be due to\r\nseveral distinct axes of movement; and we cannot judge, from the\r\nupraised shells round the estuary of the Plata, of the breadth of the\r\narea uplifted within the recent period.\r\n\r\nNot only has the above specified long range of coast been elevated\r\nwithin the recent period, but I think it may be safely inferred from\r\nthe similarity in height of the gravel-capped plains at distant points,\r\nthat there has been a remarkable degree of equability in the elevatory\r\nprocess. I may premise, that when I measured the plains, it was simply\r\nto ascertain the heights at which shells occurred; afterwards,\r\ncomparing these measurements with some of those made during the Survey,\r\nI was struck with their uniformity, and accordingly tabulated all those\r\nwhich represented the summit-edges of plains. The extension of the 330\r\nto 355 feet plain is very striking, being found over a space of 500\r\ngeographical miles in a north and south line. A table (Table 1) of the\r\nmeasurements is given below. The angular measurements and all the\r\nestimations (in feet) are by the Officers of the Survey; the\r\nbarometrical ones by myself:—\r\n\r\nTABLE 1.\r\n\r\nGallegos River to Coy Inlet (partly angular partly estimation) 350\r\nSouth Side of Santa Cruz (angular and barometric) 355 North Side of\r\nSanta Cruz (angular and barometric) 330 Bird Island, plain opposite to\r\n(angular) 350 Port Desire, plain extending far along coast (barometric)\r\n330 St. George’s Bay, north promontory (angular) 330 Table Land, south\r\nof New Bay (angular) 350\r\n\r\nA plain, varying from 245 to 255 feet, seems to extend with much\r\nuniformity from Port Desire to the north of St. George’s Bay, a\r\ndistance of 170 miles; and some approximate measurements (in feet),\r\nalso given in Table 2 below, indicate the much greater extension of 780\r\nmiles:—\r\n\r\nTABLE 2.\r\n\r\nCoy Inlet, south of (partly angular and partly estimation) 200 to 300\r\nPort Desire (barometric) 245 to 255 C. Blanco (angular) 250 North\r\nPromontory of St. George’s Bay (angular) 250 South of New Bay (angular)\r\n200 to 220 North of S. Josef (estimation) 200 to 300 Plain of Rio Negro\r\n(angular) 200 to 220 Bahia Blanca (estimation) 200 to 300\r\n\r\nThe extension, moreover, of the 560 to 580, and of the 80 to 100 feet,\r\nplains is remarkable, though somewhat less obvious than in the former\r\ncases. Bearing in mind that I have not picked these measurements out of\r\na series, but have used all those which represented the edges of\r\nplains, I think it scarcely possible that these coincidences in height\r\nshould be accidental. We must therefore conclude that the action,\r\nwhatever it may have been, by which these plains have been modelled\r\ninto their present forms, has been singularly uniform.\r\n\r\nThese plains or great terraces, of which three and four often rise like\r\nsteps one behind the other, are formed by the denudation of the old\r\nPatagonian tertiary beds, and by the deposition on their surfaces of a\r\nmass of well-rounded gravel, varying, near the coast, from ten to\r\nthirty-five feet in thickness, but increasing in thickness towards the\r\ninterior. The gravel is often capped by a thin irregular bed of sandy\r\nearth. The plains slope up, though seldom sensibly to the eye, from the\r\nsummit edge of one escarpment to the foot of the next highest one.\r\nWithin a distance of 150 miles, between Santa Cruz to Port Desire,\r\nwhere the plains are particularly well developed, there are at least\r\nseven stages or steps, one above the other. On the three lower ones,\r\nnamely, those of 100 feet, 250 feet, and 350 feet in height, existing\r\nlittoral shells are abundantly strewed, either on the surface, or\r\npartially embedded in the superficial sandy earth. By whatever action\r\nthese three lower plains have been modelled, so undoubtedly have all\r\nthe higher ones, up to a height of 950 feet at S. Julian, and of 1,200\r\nfeet (by estimation) along St. George’s Bay. I think it will not be\r\ndisputed, considering the presence of the upraised marine shells, that\r\nthe sea has been the active power during stages of some kind in the\r\nelevatory process.\r\n\r\nWe will now briefly consider this subject: if we look at the existing\r\ncoast-line, the evidence of the great denuding power of the sea is very\r\ndistinct; for, from Cape St. Diego, in latitude 54 degrees 30′ to the\r\nmouth of the Rio Negro, in latitude 31 degrees (a length of more than\r\neight hundred miles), the shore is formed, with singularly few\r\nexceptions, of bold and naked cliffs: in many places the cliffs are\r\nhigh; thus, south of the Santa Cruz, they are between eight and nine\r\nhundred feet in height, with their horizontal strata abruptly cut off,\r\nshowing the immense mass of matter which has been removed. Nearly this\r\nwhole line of coast consists of a series of greater or lesser curves,\r\nthe horns of which, and likewise certain straight projecting portions,\r\nare formed of hard rocks; hence the concave parts are evidently the\r\neffect and the measure of the denuding action on the softer strata. At\r\nthe foot of all the cliffs, the sea shoals very gradually far outwards;\r\nand the bottom, for a space of some miles, everywhere consists of\r\ngravel. I carefully examined the bed of the sea off the Santa Cruz, and\r\nfound that its inclination was exactly the same, both in amount and in\r\nits peculiar curvature, with that of the 355 feet plain at this same\r\nplace. If, therefore, the coast, with the bed of the adjoining sea,\r\nwere now suddenly elevated one or two hundred feet, an inland line of\r\ncliffs, that is an escarpment, would be formed, with a gravel-capped\r\nplain at its foot gently sloping to the sea, and having an inclination\r\nlike that of the existing 355 feet plain. From the denuding tendency of\r\nthe sea, this newly formed plain would in time be eaten back into a\r\ncliff: and repetitions of this elevatory and denuding process would\r\nproduce a series of gravel-capped sloping terraces, rising one above\r\nanother, like those fronting the shores of Patagonia.\r\n\r\nThe chief difficulty (for there are other inconsiderable ones) on this\r\nview, is the fact,—as far as I can trust two continuous lines of\r\nsoundings carefully taken between Santa Cruz and the Falkland Islands,\r\nand several scattered observations on this and other coasts,—that the\r\npebbles at the bottom of the sea QUICKLY and REGULARLY decrease in size\r\nwith the increasing depth and distance from the shore, whereas in the\r\ngravel on the sloping plains, no such decrease in size was perceptible.\r\n\r\nTable 3 below gives the average result of many soundings off the Santa\r\nCruz:— TABLE 3.\r\n\r\nUnder two miles from the shore, many of the pebbles were of large size,\r\nmingled with some small ones.\r\n\r\nColumn 1. Distance in miles from the shore.\r\n\r\nColumn 2. Depth in fathoms.\r\n\r\nColumn 3. Size of Pebbles.\r\n\r\nI particularly attended to the size of the pebbles on the 355 feet\r\nSanta Cruz plain, and I noticed that on the summit-edge of the present\r\nsea cliffs many were as large as half a man’s head; and in crossing\r\nfrom these cliffs to the foot of the next highest escarpment, a\r\ndistance of six miles, I could not observe any increase in their size.\r\nWe shall presently see that the theory of a slow and almost insensible\r\nrise of the land, will explain all the facts connected with the\r\ngravel-capped terraces, better than the theory of sudden elevations of\r\nfrom one to two hundred feet.\r\n\r\nM. d’Orbigny has argued, from the upraised shells at San Blas being\r\nembedded in the positions in which they lived, and from the valves of\r\nthe Azara labiata high on the banks of the Parana being united and\r\nunrolled, that the elevation of Northern Patagonia and of La Plata must\r\nhave been sudden; for he thinks, if it had been gradual, these shells\r\nwould all have been rolled on successive beach-lines. But in PROTECTED\r\nbays, such as in that of Bahia Blanca, wherever the sea is accumulating\r\nextensive mud-banks, or where the winds quietly heap up sand-dunes,\r\nbeds of shells might assuredly be preserved buried in the positions in\r\nwhich they had lived, even whilst the land retained the same level;\r\nany, the smallest, amount of elevation would directly aid in their\r\npreservation. I saw a multitude of spots in Bahia Blanca where this\r\nmight have been effected; and at Maldonado it almost certainly has been\r\neffected. In speaking of the elevation of the land having been slow, I\r\ndo not wish to exclude the small starts which accompany earthquakes, as\r\non the coast of Chile; and by such movements beds of shells might\r\neasily be uplifted, even in positions exposed to a heavy surf, without\r\nundergoing any attrition: for instance, in 1835, a rocky flat off the\r\nisland of Santa Maria was at one blow upheaved above high-water mark,\r\nand was left covered with gaping and putrefying mussel-shells, still\r\nattached to the bed on which they had lived. If M. d’Orbigny had been\r\naware of the many long parallel lines of sand-hillocks, with infinitely\r\nnumerous shells of the Mactra and Venus, at a low level near the\r\nUruguay; if he had seen at Bahia Blanca the immense sand-dunes, with\r\nwater-worn pebbles of pumice, ranging in parallel lines, one behind the\r\nother, up a height of at least 120 feet; if he had seen the sand-dunes,\r\nwith the countless Paludestrinas, on the low plain near the Fort at\r\nthis place, and that long line on the edge of the cliff, sixty feet\r\nhigher up; if he had crossed that long and great belt of parallel\r\nsand-dunes, eight miles in width, standing at the height of from forty\r\nto fifty feet above the Colorado, where sand could not now collect,—I\r\ncannot believe he would have thought that the elevation of this great\r\ndistrict had been sudden. Certainly the sand-dunes (especially when\r\nabounding with shells), which stand in ranges at so many different\r\nlevels, must all have required long time for their accumulation; and\r\nhence I do not doubt that the last 100 feet of elevation of La Plata\r\nand Northern Patagonia has been exceedingly slow.\r\n\r\nIf we extend this conclusion to Central and Southern Patagonia, the\r\ninclination of the successively rising gravel-capped plains can be\r\nexplained quite as well, as by the more obvious view already given of a\r\nfew comparatively great and sudden elevations; in either case we must\r\nadmit long periods of rest, during which the sea ate deeply into the\r\nland. Let us suppose the present coast to rise at a nearly equable,\r\nslow rate, yet sufficiently quick to prevent the waves quite removing\r\neach part as soon as brought up; in this case every portion of the\r\npresent bed of the sea will successively form a beach-line, and from\r\nbeing exposed to a like action will be similarly affected. It cannot\r\nmatter to what height the tides rise, even if to forty feet as at Santa\r\nCruz, for they will act with equal force and in like manner on each\r\nsuccessive line. Hence there is no difficulty in the fact of the 355\r\nfeet plain at Santa Cruz sloping up 108 feet to the foot of the next\r\nhighest escarpment, and yet having no marks of any one particular\r\nbeach-line on it; for the whole surface on this view has been a beach.\r\nI cannot pretend to follow out the precise action of the tidal-waves\r\nduring a rise of the land, slow, yet sufficiently quick to prevent or\r\ncheck denudation: but if it be analogous to what takes place on\r\nprotected parts of the present coast, where gravel is now accumulating\r\nin large quantities, an inclined surface, thickly capped by\r\nwell-rounded pebbles of about the same size, would be ultimately left.\r\n(On the eastern side of Chiloe, which island we shall see in the next\r\nchapter is now rising, I observed that all the beaches and extensive\r\ntidal-flats were formed of shingle.) On the gravel now accumulating,\r\nthe waves, aided by the wind, sometimes throw up a thin covering of\r\nsand, together with the common coast-shells. Shells thus cast up by\r\ngales, would, during an elevatory period, never again be touched by the\r\nsea. Hence, on this view of a slow and gradual rising of the land,\r\ninterrupted by periods of rest and denudation, we can understand the\r\npebbles being of about the same size over the entire width of the\r\nstep-like plains,—the occasional thin covering of sandy earth,—and the\r\npresence of broken, unrolled fragments of those shells, which now live\r\nexclusively near the coast.\r\n\r\nA SUMMARY OF RESULTS.\r\n\r\nIt may be concluded that the coast on this side of the continent, for a\r\nspace of at least 1,180 miles, has been elevated to a height of 100\r\nfeet in La Plata, and of 400 feet in Southern Patagonia, within the\r\nperiod of existing shells, but not of existing mammifers. That in La\r\nPlata the elevation has been very slowly effected: that in Patagonia\r\nthe movement may have been by considerable starts, but much more\r\nprobably slow and quiet. In either case, there have been long\r\nintervening periods of comparative rest, during which the sea corroded\r\ndeeply, as it is still corroding, into the land. (I say COMPARATIVE and\r\nnot ABSOLUTE rest, because the sea acts, as we have seen, with great\r\ndenuding power on this whole line of coast; and therefore, during an\r\nelevation of the land, if excessively slow (and of course during a\r\nsubsidence of the land), it is quite possible that lines of cliff might\r\nbe formed.) That the periods of denudation and elevation were\r\ncontemporaneous and equable over great spaces of coast, as shown by the\r\nequable heights of the plains; that there have been at least eight\r\nperiods of denudation, and that the land, up to a height of from 950 to\r\n1,200 feet, has been similarly modelled and affected: that the area\r\nelevated, in the southernmost part of the continent, extended in\r\nbreadth to the Cordillera, and probably seaward to the Falkland\r\nIslands; that northward, in La Plata, the breadth is unknown, there\r\nhaving been probably more than one axis of elevation; and finally,\r\nthat, anterior to the elevation attested by these upraised shells, the\r\nland was divided by a Strait where the River Santa Cruz now flows, and\r\nthat further southward there were other sea-straits, since closed. I\r\nmay add, that at Santa Cruz, in latitude 50 degrees S., the plains have\r\nbeen uplifted at least 1,400 feet, since the period when gigantic\r\nboulders were transported between sixty and seventy miles from their\r\nparent rock, on floating icebergs.\r\n\r\nLastly, considering the great upward movements which this long line of\r\ncoast has undergone, and the proximity of its southern half to the\r\nvolcanic axis of the Cordillera, it is highly remarkable that in the\r\nmany fine sections exposed in the Pampean, Patagonian tertiary, and\r\nBoulder formations, I nowhere observed the smallest fault or abrupt\r\ncurvature in the strata.\r\n\r\nGRAVEL FORMATION OF PATAGONIA.\r\n\r\nI will here describe in more detail than has been as yet incidentally\r\ndone, the nature, origin, and extent of the great shingle covering of\r\nPatagonia: but I do not mean to affirm that all of this shingle,\r\nespecially that on the higher plains, belongs to the recent period. A\r\nthin bed of sandy earth, with small pebbles of various porphyries and\r\nof quartz, covering a low plain on the north side of the Rio Colorado,\r\nis the extreme northern limit of this formation. These little pebbles\r\nhave probably been derived from the denudation of a more regular bed of\r\ngravel, capping the old tertiary sandstone plateau of the Rio Negro.\r\nThe gravel-bed near the Rio Negro is, on an average, about ten or\r\ntwelve feet in thickness; and the pebbles are larger than on the\r\nnorthern side of the Colorado, being from one or two inches in\r\ndiameter, and composed chiefly of rather dark-tinted porphyries.\r\nAmongst them I here first noticed a variety often to be referred to,\r\nnamely, a peculiar gallstone-yellow siliceous porphyry, frequently, but\r\nnot invariably, containing grains of quartz. The pebbles are embedded\r\nin a white, gritty, calcareous matrix, very like mortar, sometimes\r\nmerely coating with a whitewash the separate stones, and sometimes\r\nforming the greater part of the mass. In one place I saw in the gravel\r\nconcretionary nodules (not rounded) of crystallised gypsum, some as\r\nlarge as a man’s head. I traced this bed for forty-five miles inland,\r\nand was assured that it extended far into the interior. As the surface\r\nof the calcareo- argillaceous plain of Pampean formation, on the\r\nnorthern side of the wide valley of the Colorado, stands at about the\r\nsame height with the mortar- like cemented gravel capping the sandstone\r\non the southern side, it is probable, considering the apparent\r\nequability of the subterranean movements along this side of America,\r\nthat this gravel of the Rio Negro and the upper beds of the Pampean\r\nformation northward of the Colorado, are of nearly contemporaneous\r\norigin, and that the calcareous matter has been derived from the same\r\nsource.\r\n\r\nSouthward of the Rio Negro, the cliffs along the great bay of S.\r\nAntonio are capped with gravel: at San Josef, I found that the pebbles\r\nclosely resembled those on the plain of the Rio Negro, but that they\r\nwere not cemented by calcareous matter. Between San Josef and Port\r\nDesire, I was assured by the Officers of the Survey that the whole face\r\nof the country is coated with gravel. At Port Desire and over a space\r\nof twenty-five miles inland, on the three step-formed plains and in the\r\nvalleys, I everywhere passed over gravel which, where thickest, was\r\nbetween thirty and forty feet. Here, as in other parts of Patagonia,\r\nthe gravel, or its sandy covering, was, as we have seen, often strewed\r\nwith recent marine shells. The sandy covering sometimes fills up\r\nfurrows in the gravel, as does the gravel in the underlying tertiary\r\nformations. The pebbles are frequently whitewashed and even cemented\r\ntogether by a peculiar, white, friable, aluminous, fusible substance,\r\nwhich I believe is decomposed feldspar. At Port Desire, the gravel\r\nrested sometimes on the basal formation of porphyry, and sometimes on\r\nthe upper or the lower denuded tertiary strata. It is remarkable that\r\nmost of the porphyritic pebbles differ from those varieties of porphyry\r\nwhich occur here abundantly in situ. The peculiar gallstone-yellow\r\nvariety was common, but less numerous than at Port S. Julian, where it\r\nformed nearly one-third of the mass of the gravel; the remaining part\r\nthere consisting of pale grey and greenish porphyries with many\r\ncrystals of feldspar. At Port S. Julian, I ascended one of the flat-\r\ntopped hills, the denuded remnant of the highest plain, and found it,\r\nat the height of 950 feet, capped with the usual bed of gravel.\r\n\r\nNear the mouth of the Santa Cruz, the bed of gravel on the 355 feet\r\nplain is from twenty to about thirty-five feet in thickness. The\r\npebbles vary from minute ones to the size of a hen’s egg, and even to\r\nthat of half a man’s head; they consist of paler varieties of porphyry\r\nthan those found further northward, and there are fewer of the\r\ngallstone-yellow kind; pebbles of compact black clay-slate were here\r\nfirst observed. The gravel, as we have seen, covers the step-formed\r\nplains at the mouth, head, and on the sides of the great valley of the\r\nSanta Cruz. At a distance of 110 miles from the coast, the plain has\r\nrisen to the height of 1,416 feet above the sea; and the gravel, with\r\nthe associated great boulder formation, has attained a thickness of 212\r\nfeet. The plain, apparently with its usual gravel covering, slopes up\r\nto the foot of the Cordillera to the height of between 3,200 and 3,300\r\nfeet. In ascending the valley, the gravel gradually becomes entirely\r\naltered in character: high up, we have pebbles of crystalline\r\nfeldspathic rocks, compact clay-slate, quartzose schists, and\r\npale-coloured porphyries; these rocks, judging both from the gigantic\r\nboulders in the surface and from some small pebbles embedded beneath\r\n700 feet in thickness of the old tertiary strata, are the prevailing\r\nkinds in this part of the Cordillera; pebbles of basalt from the\r\nneighbouring streams of basaltic lava are also numerous; there are few\r\nor none of the reddish or of the gallstone-yellow porphyries so common\r\nnear the coast. Hence the pebbles on the 350 feet plain at the mouth of\r\nthe Santa Cruz cannot have been derived (with the exception of those of\r\ncompact clay- slate, which, however, may equally well have come from\r\nthe south) from the Cordillera in this latitude; but probably, in chief\r\npart, from farther north.\r\n\r\nSouthward of the Santa Cruz, the gravel may be seen continuously\r\ncapping the great 840 feet plain: at the Rio Gallegos, where this plain\r\nis succeeded by a lower one, there is, as I am informed by Captain\r\nSulivan, an irregular covering of gravel from ten to twelve feet in\r\nthickness over the whole country. The district on each side of the\r\nStrait of Magellan is covered up either with gravel or the boulder\r\nformation: it was interesting to observe the marked difference between\r\nthe perfectly rounded state of the pebbles in the great shingle\r\nformation of Patagonia, and the more or less angular fragments in the\r\nboulder formation. The pebbles and fragments near the Strait of\r\nMagellan nearly all belong to rocks known to occur in Fuegia. I was\r\ntherefore much surprised in dredging south of the Strait to find, in\r\nlatitude 54 degrees 10′ south, many pebbles of the gallstone-yellow\r\nsiliceous porphyry; I procured others from a great depth off Staten\r\nIsland, and others were brought me from the western extremity of the\r\nFalkland Islands. (At my request, Mr. Kent collected for me a bag of\r\npebbles from the beach of White Rock harbour, in the northern part of\r\nthe sound, between the two Falkland Islands. Out of these well-rounded\r\npebbles, varying in size from a walnut to a hen’s egg, with some\r\nlarger, thirty-eight evidently belonged to the rocks of these islands;\r\ntwenty-six were similar to the pebbles of porphyry found on the\r\nPatagonian plains, which rocks do not exist in situ in the Falklands;\r\none pebble belonged to the peculiar yellow siliceous porphyry; thirty\r\nwere of doubtful origin.) The distribution of the pebbles of this\r\npeculiar porphyry, which I venture to affirm is not found in situ\r\neither in Fuegia, the Falkland Islands, or on the coast of Patagonia,\r\nis very remarkable, for they are found over a space of 840 miles in a\r\nnorth and south line, and at the Falklands, 300 miles eastward of the\r\ncoast of Patagonia. Their occurrence in Fuegia and the Falklands may,\r\nhowever, perhaps be due to the same ice-agency by which the boulders\r\nhave been there transported.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that porphyritic pebbles of a small size are first met\r\nwith on the northern side of the Rio Colorado, the bed becoming well\r\ndeveloped near the Rio Negro: from this latter point I have every\r\nreason to believe that the gravel extends uninterruptedly over the\r\nplains and valleys of Patagonia for at least 630 nautical miles\r\nsouthward to the Rio Gallegos. From the slope of the plains, from the\r\nnature of the pebbles, from their extension at the Rio Negro far into\r\nthe interior, and at the Santa Cruz close up to the Cordillera, I think\r\nit highly probable that the whole breadth of Patagonia is thus covered.\r\nIf so, the average width of the bed must be about two hundred miles.\r\nNear the coast the gravel is generally from ten to thirty feet in\r\nthickness; and as in the valley of Santa Cruz it attains, at some\r\ndistance from the Cordillera, a thickness of 214 feet, we may, I think,\r\nsafely assume its average thickness over the whole area of 630 by 200\r\nmiles, at fifty feet!\r\n\r\nThe transportal and origin of this vast bed of pebbles is an\r\ninteresting problem. From the manner in which they cap the step-formed\r\nplains, worn by the sea within the period of existing shells, their\r\ndeposition, at least on the plains up to a height of 400 feet, must\r\nhave been a recent geological event. From the form of the continent, we\r\nmay feel sure that they have come from the westward, probably, in chief\r\npart from the Cordillera, but, perhaps, partly from unknown rocky\r\nridges in the central districts of Patagonia. That the pebbles have not\r\nbeen transported by rivers, from the interior towards the coast, we may\r\nconclude from the fewness and smallness of the streams of Patagonia:\r\nmoreover, in the case of the one great and rapid river of Santa Cruz,\r\nwe have good evidence that its transporting power is very trifling.\r\nThis river is from two to three hundred yards in width, about seventeen\r\nfeet deep in its middle, and runs with a singular degree of uniformity\r\nfive knots an hour, with no lakes and scarcely any still reaches:\r\nnevertheless, to give one instance of its small transporting power,\r\nupon careful examination, pebbles of compact basalt could not be found\r\nin the bed of the river at a greater distance than ten miles below the\r\npoint where the stream rushes over the debris of the great basaltic\r\ncliffs forming its shore: fragments of the CELLULAR varieties have been\r\nwashed down twice or thrice as far. That the pebbles in Central and\r\nNorthern Patagonia have not been transported by ice-agency, as seems to\r\nhave been the case to a considerable extent farther south, and likewise\r\nin the northern hemisphere, we may conclude, from the absence of all\r\nangular fragments in the gravel, and from the complete contrast in many\r\nother respects between the shingle and neighbouring boulder formation.\r\n\r\nLooking to the gravel on any one of the step-formed plains, I cannot\r\ndoubt, from the several reasons assigned in this chapter, that it has\r\nbeen spread out and leveled by the long-continued action of the sea,\r\nprobably during the slow rise of the land. The smooth and perfectly\r\nrounded condition of the innumerable pebbles alone would prove\r\nlong-continued action. But how the whole mass of shingle on the\r\ncoast-plains has been transported from the mountains of the interior,\r\nis another and more difficult question. The following considerations,\r\nhowever, show that the sea by its ordinary action has considerable\r\npower in distributing pebbles. Table 3 above shows how very uniformly\r\nand gradually the pebbles decrease in size with the gradually seaward\r\nincreasing depth and distance. (I may mention, that at the distance of\r\n150 miles from the Patagonian shore I carefully examined the minute\r\nrounded particles in the sand, and found them to be fusible like the\r\nporphyries of the great shingle bed. I could even distinguish particles\r\nof the gallstone-yellow porphyry. It was interesting to notice how\r\ngradually the particles of white quartz increased, as we approached the\r\nFalkland Islands, which are thus constituted. In the whole line of\r\nsoundings between these islands and the coast of Patagonia dead or\r\nliving organic remains were most rare. On the relations between the\r\ndepth of water and the nature of the bottom, see Martin White on\r\n“Soundings in the Channel” pages 4, 6, 175; also Captain Beechey’s\r\n“Voyage to the Pacific” chapter 18.) A series of this kind irresistibly\r\nleads to the conclusion, that the sea has the power of sifting and\r\ndistributing the loose matter on its bottom. According to Martin White,\r\nthe bed of the British Channel is disturbed during gales at depths of\r\nsixty-three and sixty-seven fathoms, and at thirty fathoms, shingle and\r\nfragments of shells are often deposited, afterwards to be carried away\r\nagain. (“Soundings in the Channel” pages 4, 166. M. Siau states\r\n(“Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal” volume 31 page 246), that he\r\nfound the sediment, at a depth of 188 metres, arranged in ripples of\r\ndifferent degrees of fineness. There are some excellent discussions on\r\nthis and allied subjects in Sir H. De la Beche’s “Theoretical\r\nResearches.”) Groundswells, which are believed to be caused by distant\r\ngales, seem especially to affect the bottom: at such times, according\r\nto Sir R. Schomburgk, the sea to a great distance round the West Indian\r\nIslands, at depths from five to fifteen fathoms, becomes discoloured,\r\nand even the anchors of vessels have been moved. (“Journal of Royal\r\nGeographical Society” volume 5 page 25. It appears from Mr. Scott\r\nRussell’s investigations (see Mr. Murchison’s “Anniversary Address\r\nGeological Society” 1843 page 40), that in waves of translation the\r\nmotion of the particles of water is nearly as great at the bottom as at\r\nthe top.) There are, however, some difficulties in understanding how\r\nthe sea can transport pebbles lying at the bottom, for, from\r\nexperiments instituted on the power of running water, it would appear\r\nthat the currents of the sea have not sufficient velocity to move\r\nstones of even moderate size: moreover, I have repeatedly found in the\r\nmost exposed situations that the pebbles which lie at the bottom are\r\nencrusted with full-grown living corallines, furnished with the most\r\ndelicate, yet unbroken spines: for instance, in ten fathoms water off\r\nthe mouth of the Santa Cruz, many pebbles, under half an inch in\r\ndiameter, were thus coated with Flustracean zoophytes. (A pebble, one\r\nand a half inch square and half an inch thick, was given me, dredged up\r\nfrom twenty-seven fathoms depth off the western end of the Falkland\r\nIslands, where the sea is remarkably stormy, and subject to violent\r\ntides. This pebble was encrusted on all sides by a delicate living\r\ncoralline. I have seen many pebbles from depths between forty and\r\nseventy fathoms thus encrusted; one from the latter depth off Cape\r\nHorn.) Hence we must conclude that these pebbles are not often\r\nviolently disturbed: it should, however, be borne in mind that the\r\ngrowth of corallines is rapid. The view, propounded by Professor\r\nPlayfair, will, I believe, explain this apparent difficulty,—namely,\r\nthat from the undulations of the sea TENDING to lift up and down\r\npebbles or other loose bodies at the bottom, such are liable, when thus\r\nquite or partially raised, to be moved even by a very small force, a\r\nlittle onwards. We can thus understand how oceanic or tidal currents of\r\nno great strength, or that recoil movement of the bottom-water near the\r\nland, called by sailors the “undertow” (which I presume must extend out\r\nseaward as far as the BREAKING waves impel the surface-water towards\r\nthe beach), may gain the power during storms of sifting and\r\ndistributing pebbles even of considerable size, and yet without so\r\nviolently disturbing them as to injure the encrusting corallines. (I\r\nmay take this opportunity of remarking on a singular, but very common\r\ncharacter in the form of the bottom, in the creeks which deeply\r\npenetrate the western shores of Tierra del Fuego; namely, that they are\r\nalmost invariably much shallower close to the open sea at their mouths\r\nthan inland. Thus, Cook, in entering Christmas Sound, first had\r\nsoundings in thirty-seven fathoms, then in fifty, then in sixty, and a\r\nlittle farther in no bottom with 170 fathoms. The sealers are so\r\nfamiliar with this fact, that they always look out for anchorage near\r\nthe entrances of the creeks. See, also, on this subject, the “Voyages\r\nof the ‘Adventure’ and ‘Beagle’” volume 1 page 375 and “Appendix” page\r\n313. This Shoalness of the sea- channels near their entrances probably\r\nresults from the quantity of sediment formed by the wear and tear of\r\nthe outer rocks exposed to the full force of the open sea. I have no\r\ndoubt that many lakes, for instance in Scotland, which are very deep\r\nwithin, and are separated from the sea apparently only by a tract of\r\ndetritus, were originally sea-channels with banks of this nature near\r\ntheir mouths, which have since been upheaved.)\r\n\r\nThe sea acts in another and distinct manner in the distribution of\r\npebbles, namely by the waves on the beach. Mr. Palmer, in his excellent\r\nmemoir on this subject, has shown that vast masses of shingle travel\r\nwith surprising quickness along lines of coast, according to the\r\ndirection with which the waves break on the beach and that this is\r\ndetermined by the prevailing direction of the winds. (“Philosophical\r\nTransactions” 1834 page 576.) This agency must be powerful in mingling\r\ntogether and disseminating pebbles derived from different sources: we\r\nmay, perhaps, thus understand the wide distribution of the\r\ngallstone-yellow porphyry; and likewise, perhaps, the great difference\r\nin the nature of the pebbles at the mouth of the Santa Cruz from those\r\nin the same latitude at the head of the valley.\r\n\r\nI will not pretend to assign to these several and complicated agencies\r\ntheir shares in the distribution of the Patagonian shingle: but from\r\nthe several considerations given in this chapter, and I may add, from\r\nthe frequency of a capping of gravel on tertiary deposits in all parts\r\nof the world, as I have myself observed and seen stated in the works of\r\nvarious authors, I cannot doubt that the power of widely dispersing\r\ngravel is an ordinary contingent on the action of the sea; and that\r\neven in the case of the great Patagonian shingle-bed we have no\r\noccasion to call in the aid of debacles. I at one time imagined that\r\nperhaps an immense accumulation of shingle had originally been\r\ncollected at the foot of the Cordillera; and that this accumulation,\r\nwhen upraised above the level of the sea, had been eaten into and\r\npartially spread out (as off the present line of coast); and that the\r\nnewly-spread out bed had in its turn been upraised, eaten into, and\r\nre-spread out; and so onwards, until the shingle, which was first\r\naccumulated in great thickness at the foot of the Cordillera, had\r\nreached in thinner beds its present extension. By whatever means the\r\ngravel formation of Patagonia may have been distributed, the vastness\r\nof its area, its thickness, its superficial position, its recent\r\norigin, and the great degree of similarity in the nature of its\r\npebbles, all appear to me well deserving the attention of geologists,\r\nin relation to the origin of the widely-spread beds of conglomerate\r\nbelonging to past epochs.\r\n\r\nFORMATION OF CLIFFS.\r\n\r\n(DIAGRAM 7.—SECTION OF COAST-CLIFFS AND BOTTOM OF SEA, OFF THE ISLAND\r\nOF ST.

The section in Diagram 7, which\r\nrepresents the general form of the land on the northern and leeward\r\nside of St. Helena (taken from Mr. Seale’s large model and various\r\nmeasurements), and of the bottom of the adjoining sea (taken chiefly\r\nfrom Captain Austin’s survey and some old charts), will show the nature\r\nof this difficulty.\r\n\r\nIf, as seems probable, the basaltic streams were originally prolonged\r\nwith nearly their present inclination, they must, as shown by the\r\ndotted line in the section, once have extended at least to a point, now\r\ncovered by the sea to a depth of nearly thirty fathoms: but I have\r\nevery reason to believe they extended considerably further, for the\r\ninclination of the streams is less near the coast than further inland.\r\nIt should also be observed, that other sections on the coast of this\r\nisland would have given far more striking results, but I had not the\r\nexact measurements; thus, on the windward side, the cliffs are about\r\ntwo thousand feet in height and the cut-off lava streams very gently\r\ninclined, and the bottom of the sea has nearly a similar slope all\r\nround the island. How, then, has all the hard basaltic rock, which once\r\nextended beneath the surface of the sea, been worn away? According to\r\nCaptain Austin, the bottom is uneven and rocky only to that very small\r\ndistance from the beach within which the depth is from five to six\r\nfathoms; outside this line, to a depth of about one hundred fathoms,\r\nthe bottom is smooth, gently inclined, and formed of mud and sand;\r\noutside the one hundred fathoms, it plunges suddenly into unfathomable\r\ndepths, as is so very commonly the case on all coasts where sediment is\r\naccumulating. At greater depths than the five or six fathoms, it seems\r\nimpossible, under existing circumstances, that the sea can both have\r\nworn away hard rock, in parts to a thickness of at least 150 feet, and\r\nhave deposited a smooth bed of fine sediment. Now, if we had any reason\r\nto suppose that St. Helena had, during a long period, gone on slowly\r\nsubsiding, every difficulty would be removed: for looking at the\r\ndiagram, and imagining a fresh amount of subsidence, we can see that\r\nthe waves would then act on the coast-cliffs with fresh and unimpaired\r\nvigour, whilst the rocky ledge near the beach would be carried down to\r\nthat depth, at which sand and mud would be deposited on its bare and\r\nuneven surface: after the formation near the shore of a new rocky\r\nshoal, fresh subsidence would carry it down and allow it to be smoothly\r\ncovered up. But in the case of the many cliff-bounded islands, for\r\ninstance in some of the Canary Islands and of Madeira, round which the\r\ninclination of the strata shows that the land once extended far into\r\nthe depths of the sea, where there is no apparent means of hard rock\r\nbeing worn away—are we to suppose that all these islands have slowly\r\nsubsided? Madeira, I may remark, has, according to Mr. Smith of Jordan\r\nHill, subsided. Are we to extend this conclusion to the high, cliff-\r\nbound, horizontally stratified shores of Patagonia, off which, though\r\nthe water is not deep even at the distance of several miles, yet the\r\nsmooth bottom of pebbles gradually decreasing in size with the\r\nincreasing depth, and derived from a foreign source, seem to declare\r\nthat the sea is now a depositing and not a corroding agent? I am much\r\ninclined to suspect, that we shall hereafter find in all such cases,\r\nthat the land with the adjoining bed of the sea has in truth subsided:\r\nthe time will, I believe, come, when geologists will consider it as\r\nimprobable, that the land should have retained the same level during a\r\nwhole geological period, as that the atmosphere should have remained\r\nabsolutely calm during an entire season.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\nON THE ELEVATION OF THE WESTERN COAST OF SOUTH AMERICA.\r\n\r\n\r\nChonos Archipelago.—Chiloe, recent and gradual elevation of, traditions\r\nof the inhabitants on this subject.—Concepcion, earthquake and\r\nelevation of.—VALPARAISO, great elevation of, upraised shells, earth of\r\nmarine origin, gradual rise of the land within the historical\r\nperiod.—COQUIMBO, elevation of, in recent times; terraces of marine\r\norigin, their inclination, their escarpments not horizontal.—Guasco,\r\ngravel terraces of.—Copiapo.—PERU.—Upraised shells of Cobija, Iquique,\r\nand Arica.—Lima, shell-beds and sea-beach on San Lorenzo, human\r\nremains, fossil earthenware, earthquake debacle, recent subsidence.—On\r\nthe decay of upraised shells.—General summary.\r\n\r\n\r\nCommencing at the south and proceeding northward, the first place at\r\nwhich I landed, was at Cape Tres Montes, in latitude 46 degrees 35′.\r\nHere, on the shores of Christmas Cove, I observed in several places a\r\nbeach of pebbles with recent shells, about twenty feet above high-water\r\nmark. Southward of Tres Montes (between latitude 47 and 48 degrees),\r\nByron remarks, “We thought it very strange, that upon the summits of\r\nthe highest hills were found beds of shells, a foot or two thick.”\r\n(“Narrative of the Loss of the ‘Wager’.”) In the Chonos Archipelago,\r\nthe island of Lemus (latitude 44 degrees 30′) was, according to M.\r\nCoste, suddenly elevated eight feet, during the earthquake of 1829: he\r\nadds, “Des roches jadis toujours couvertes par la mer, restant\r\naujourd’hui constamment decouvertes.” (“Comptes Rendus” October 1838\r\npage 706.) In other parts of this archipelago, I observed two terraces\r\nof gravel, abutting to the foot of each other: at Lowe’s Harbour (43\r\ndegrees 48′), under a great mass of the boulder formation, about three\r\nhundred feet in thickness, I found a layer of sand, with numerous\r\ncomminuted fragments of sea-shells, having a fresh aspect, but too\r\nsmall to be identified.\r\n\r\nTHE ISLAND OF CHILOE.\r\n\r\nThe evidence of recent elevation is here more satisfactory. The bay of\r\nSan Carlos is in most parts bounded by precipitous cliffs from about\r\nten to forty feet in height, their bases being separated from the\r\npresent line of tidal action by a talus, a few feet in height, covered\r\nwith vegetation. In one sheltered creek (west of P. Arena), instead of\r\na loose talus, there was a bare sloping bank of tertiary mudstone,\r\nperforated, above the line of the highest tides, by numerous shells of\r\na Pholas now common in the harbour. The upper extremities of these\r\nshells, standing upright in their holes with grass growing out of them,\r\nwere abraded about a quarter of an inch, to the same level with the\r\nsurrounding worn strata. In other parts, I observed (as at Pudeto) a\r\ngreat beach, formed of comminuted shells, twenty feet above the present\r\nshore. In other parts again, there were small caves worn into the foot\r\nof the low cliffs, and protected from the waves by the talus with its\r\nvegetation: one such cave, which I examined, had its mouth about twenty\r\nfeet, and its bottom, which was filled with sand containing fragments\r\nof shells and legs of crabs, from eight to ten feet above high-water\r\nmark. From these several facts, and from the appearance of the upraised\r\nshells, I inferred that the elevation had been quite recent; and on\r\ninquiring from Mr. Williams, the Portmaster, he told me he was\r\nconvinced that the land had risen, or the sea fallen, four feet within\r\nthe last four years. During this period, there had been one severe\r\nearthquake, but no particular change of level was then observed; from\r\nthe habits of the people who all keep boats in the protected creeks, it\r\nis absolutely impossible that a rise of four feet could have taken\r\nplace suddenly and been unperceived. Mr. Williams believes that the\r\nchange has been quite gradual. Without the elevatory movement continues\r\nat a quick rate, there can be no doubt that the sea will soon destroy\r\nthe talus of earth at the foot of the cliffs round the bay, and will\r\nthen reach its former lateral extension, but not of course its former\r\nlevel: some of the inhabitants assured me that one such talus, with a\r\nfootpath on it, was even already sensibly decreasing in width.\r\n\r\nI received several accounts of beds of shells, existing at considerable\r\nheights in the inland parts of Chiloe; and to one of these, near\r\nCatiman, I was guided by a countryman. Here, on the south side of the\r\npeninsula of Lacuy, there was an immense bed of the Venus costellata\r\nand of an oyster, lying on the summit-edge of a piece of tableland, 350\r\nfeet (by the barometer) above the level of the sea. The shells were\r\nclosely packed together, embedded in and covered by a very black, damp,\r\npeaty mould, two or three feet in thickness, out of which a forest of\r\ngreat trees was growing. Considering the nature and dampness of this\r\npeaty soil, it is surprising that the fine ridges on the outside of the\r\nVenus are perfectly preserved, though all the shells have a blackened\r\nappearance. I did not doubt that the black soil, which when dry, cakes\r\nhard, was entirely of terrestrial origin, but on examining it under the\r\nmicroscope, I found many very minute rounded fragments of shells,\r\namongst which I could distinguish bits of Serpulae and mussels. The\r\nVenus costellata, and the Ostrea (O. edulis, according to Captain King)\r\nare now the commonest shells in the adjoining bays. In a bed of shells,\r\na few feet below the 350 feet bed, I found a horn of the little Cervus\r\nhumilis, which now inhabits Chiloe.\r\n\r\nThe eastern or inland side of Chiloe, with its many adjacent islets,\r\nconsists of tertiary and boulder deposits, worn into irregular plains\r\ncapped by gravel. Near Castro, and for ten miles southward, and on the\r\nislet of Lemuy, I found the surface of the ground to a height of\r\nbetween twenty and thirty feet above high-water mark, and in several\r\nplaces apparently up to fifty feet, thickly coated by much comminuted\r\nshells, chiefly of the Venus costellata and Mytilus Chiloensis; the\r\nspecies now most abundant on this line of coast. As the inhabitants\r\ncarry immense numbers of these shells inland, the continuity of the bed\r\nat the same height was often the only means of recognising its natural\r\norigin. Near Castro, on each side of the creek and rivulet of the\r\nGamboa, three distinct terraces are seen: the lowest was estimated at\r\nabout one hundred and fifty feet in height, and the highest at about\r\nfive hundred feet, with the country irregularly rising behind it;\r\nobscure traces, also, of these same terraces could be seen along other\r\nparts of the coast. There can be no doubt that their three escarpments\r\nrecord pauses in the elevation of the island. I may remark that several\r\npromontories have the word Huapi, which signifies in the Indian tongue,\r\nisland, appended to them, such as Huapilinao, Huapilacuy, Caucahuapi,\r\netc.; and these, according to Indian traditions, once existed as\r\nislands. In the same manner the term Pulo in Sumatra is appended to the\r\nnames of promontories, traditionally said to have been islands\r\n(Marsden’s “Sumatra” page 31.); in Sumatra, as in Chiloe, there are\r\nupraised recent shells. The Bay of Carelmapu, on the mainland north of\r\nChiloe, according to Aguerros, was in 1643 a good harbour (“Descripcion\r\nHist. de la Provincia de Chiloe” page 78. From the account given by the\r\nold Spanish writers, it would appear that several other harbours,\r\nbetween this point and Concepcion, were formerly much deeper than they\r\nnow are.); it is now quite useless, except for boats.\r\n\r\nVALDIVIA.\r\n\r\nI did not observe here any distinct proofs of recent elevation; but in\r\na bed of very soft sandstone, forming a fringe-like plain, about sixty\r\nfeet in height, round the hills of mica-slate, there are shells of\r\nMytilus, Crepidula, Solen, Novaculina, and Cytheraea, too imperfect to\r\nbe specifically recognised. At Imperial, seventy miles north of\r\nValdivia, Aguerros states that there are large beds of shells, at a\r\nconsiderable distance from the coast, which are burnt for lime. (Ibid\r\npage 25.) The island of Mocha, lying a little north of Imperial, was\r\nuplifted two feet, during the earthquake of 1835. (“Voyages of\r\n‘Adventure’ and ‘Beagle’” volume 2 page 415.)\r\n\r\nCONCEPCION.\r\n\r\nI cannot add anything to the excellent account by Captain Fitzroy of\r\nthe elevation of the land at this place, which accompanied the\r\nearthquake of 1835. (Ibid volume 2 page 412 et seq. In volume 5 page\r\n601 of the “Geological Transactions” I have given an account of the\r\nremarkable volcanic phenomena, which accompanied this earthquake. These\r\nphenomena appear to me to prove that the action, by which large tracts\r\nof land are uplifted, and by which volcanic eruptions are produced, is\r\nin every respect identical.) I will only recall to the recollection of\r\ngeologists, that the southern end of the island of St. Mary was\r\nuplifted eight feet, the central part nine, and the northern end ten\r\nfeet; and the whole island more than the surrounding districts. Great\r\nbeds of mussels, patellae, and chitons still adhering to the rocks were\r\nupraised above high-water mark; and some acres of a rocky flat, which\r\nwas formerly always covered by the sea, was left standing dry, and\r\nexhaled an offensive smell, from the many attached and putrefying\r\nshells. It appears from the researches of Captain Fitzroy that both the\r\nisland of St. Mary and Concepcion (which was uplifted only four or five\r\nfeet) in the course of some weeks subsided, and lost part of their\r\nfirst elevation. I will only add as a lesson of caution, that round the\r\nsandy shores of the great Bay of Concepcion, it was most difficult,\r\nowing to the obliterating effects of the great accompanying wave, to\r\nrecognise any distinct evidence of this considerable upheaval; one spot\r\nmust be excepted, where there was a detached rock which before the\r\nearthquake had always been covered by the sea, but afterwards was left\r\nuncovered.\r\n\r\nOn the island of Quiriquina (in the Bay of Concepcion), I found, at an\r\nestimated height of four hundred feet, extensive layers of shells,\r\nmostly comminuted, but some perfectly preserved and closely packed in\r\nblack vegetable mould; they consisted of Concholepas, Fissurella,\r\nMytilus, Trochus, and Balanus. Some of these layers of shells rested on\r\na thick bed of bright-red, dry, friable earth, capping the surface of\r\nthe tertiary sandstone, and extending, as I observed whilst sailing\r\nalong the coast, for 150 miles southward: at Valparaiso, we shall\r\npresently see that a similar red earthy mass, though quite like\r\nterrestrial mould, is really in chief part of recent marine origin. On\r\nthe flanks of this island of Quiriquina, at a less height than the 400\r\nfeet, there were spaces several feet square, thickly strewed with\r\nfragments of similar shells. During a subsequent visit of the “Beagle”\r\nto Concepcion, Mr. Kent, the assistant-surgeon, was so kind as to make\r\nfor me some measurements with the barometer: he found many marine\r\nremains along the shores of the whole bay, at a height of about twenty\r\nfeet; and from the hill of Sentinella behind Talcahuano, at the height\r\nof 160 feet, he collected numerous shells, packed together close\r\nbeneath the surface in black earth, consisting of two species of\r\nMytilus, two of Crepidula, one of Concholepas, of Fissurella, Venus,\r\nMactra, Turbo, Monoceros, and the Balanus psittacus. These shells were\r\nbleached, and within some of the Balani other Balani were growing,\r\nshowing that they must have long lain dead in the sea. The above\r\nspecies I compared with living ones from the bay, and found them\r\nidentical; but having since lost the specimens, I cannot give their\r\nnames: this is of little importance, as Mr. Broderip has examined a\r\nsimilar collection, made during Captain Beechey’s expedition, and\r\nascertained that they consisted of ten recent species, associated with\r\nfragments of Echini, crabs, and Flustrae; some of these remains were\r\nestimated by Lieutenant Belcher to lie at the height of nearly a\r\nthousand feet above the level of the sea. (“Zoology of Captain\r\nBeechey’s Voyage” page 162.) In some places round the bay, Mr. Kent\r\nobserved that there were beds formed exclusively of the Mytilus\r\nChiloensis: this species now lives in parts never uncovered by the\r\ntides. At considerable heights, Mr. Kent found only a few shells; but\r\nfrom the summit of one hill, 625 feet high, he brought me specimens of\r\nthe Concholepas, Mytilus Chiloensis, and a Turbo. These shells were\r\nsofter and more brittle than those from the height of 164 feet; and\r\nthese latter had obviously a much more ancient appearance than the same\r\nspecies from the height of only twenty feet.\r\n\r\nCOAST NORTH OF CONCEPCION.\r\n\r\nThe first point examined was at the mouth of the Rapel (160 miles north\r\nof Concepcion and sixty miles south of Valparaiso), where I observed a\r\nfew shells at the height of 100 feet, and some barnacles adhering to\r\nthe rocks three or four feet above the highest tides: M. Gay found here\r\nrecent shells at the distance of two leagues from the shore. (“Annales\r\ndes Scienc. Nat.” Avril 1833.) Inland there are some wide,\r\ngravel-capped plains, intersected by many broad, flat-bottomed valleys\r\n(now carrying insignificant streamlets), with their sides cut into\r\nsuccessive wall-like escarpments, rising one above another, and in many\r\nplaces, according to M. Gay, worn into caves. The one cave (C. del\r\nObispo) which I examined, resembled those formed on many sea-coasts,\r\nwith its bottom filled with shingle. These inland plains, instead of\r\nsloping towards the coast, are inclined in an opposite direction\r\ntowards the Cordillera, like the successively rising terraces on the\r\ninland or eastern side of Chiloe: some points of granite, which project\r\nthrough the plains near the coast, no doubt once formed a chain of\r\noutlying islands, on the inland shores of which the plains were\r\naccumulated. At Bucalemu, a few miles northward of the Rapel, I\r\nobserved at the foot, and on the summit-edge of a plain, ten miles from\r\nthe coast, many recent shells, mostly comminuted, but some perfect.\r\nThere were, also, many at the bottom of the great valley of the Maypu.\r\nAt San Antonio, shells are said to be collected and burnt for lime. At\r\nthe bottom of a great ravine (Quebrada Onda, on the road to Casa\r\nBlanca), at the distance of several miles from the coast, I noticed a\r\nconsiderable bed, composed exclusively of Mesodesma donaciforme, Desh.,\r\nlying on a bed of muddy sand: this shell now lives associated together\r\nin great numbers, on tidal-flats on the coast of Chile.\r\n\r\nVALPARAISO.\r\n\r\nDuring two successive years I carefully examined, part of the time in\r\ncompany with Mr. Alison, into all the facts connected with the recent\r\nelevation of this neighbourhood. In very many parts a beach of broken\r\nshells, about fourteen or fifteen feet above high-water mark, may be\r\nobserved; and at this level the coast-rocks, where precipitous, are\r\ncorroded in a band. At one spot, Mr. Alison, by removing some birds’\r\ndung, found at this same level barnacles adhering to the rocks. For\r\nseveral miles southward of the bay, almost every flat little headland,\r\nbetween the heights of 60 and 230 feet (measured by the barometer), is\r\nsmoothly coated by a thick mass of comminuted shells, of the same\r\nspecies, and apparently in the same proportional numbers with those\r\nexisting in the adjoining sea. The Concholepas is much the most\r\nabundant, and the best preserved shell; but I extracted perfectly\r\npreserved specimens of the Fissurella biradiata, a Trochus and Balanus\r\n(both well-known, but according to Mr. Sowerby yet unnamed) and parts\r\nof the Mytilus Chiloensis. Most of these shells, as well as an\r\nencrusting Nullipora, partially retain their colour; but they are\r\nbrittle, and often stained red from the underlying brecciated mass of\r\nprimary rocks; some are packed together, either in black or reddish\r\nmoulds; some lie loose on the bare rocky surfaces. The total number of\r\nthese shells is immense; they are less numerous, though still far from\r\nrare, up a height of 1,000 feet above the sea. On the summit of a hill,\r\nmeasured 557 feet, there was a small horizontal band of comminuted\r\nshells, of which MANY consisted (and likewise from lesser heights) of\r\nvery young and small specimens of the still living Concholepas,\r\nTrochus, Patellae, Crepidulae, and of Mytilus Magellanicus (?) (Mr.\r\nCuming informs me that he does not think this species identical with,\r\nthough closely resembling, the true M. Magellanicus of the southern and\r\neastern coast of South America; it lives abundantly on the coast of\r\nChile.): several of these shells were under a quarter of an inch in\r\ntheir greatest diameter. My attention was called to this circumstance\r\nby a native fisherman, whom I took to look at these shell-beds; and he\r\nridiculed the notion of such small shells having been brought up for\r\nfood; nor could some of the species have adhered when alive to other\r\nlarger shells. On another hill, some miles distant, and 648 feet high,\r\nI found shells of the Concholepas and Trochus, perfect, though very\r\nold, with fragments of Mytilus Chiloensis, all embedded in\r\nreddish-brown mould: I also found these same species, with fragments of\r\nan Echinus and of Balanus psittacus, on a hill 1,000 feet high. Above\r\nthis height, shells became very rare, though on a hill 1,300 feet high\r\n(Measured by the barometer: the highest point in the range behind\r\nValparaiso I found to be 1,626 feet above the level of the sea.), I\r\ncollected the Concholepas, Trochus, Fissurella, and a Patella. At these\r\ngreater heights the shells are almost invariably embedded in mould, and\r\nsometimes are exposed only by tearing up bushes. These shells obviously\r\nhad a very much more ancient appearance than those from the lesser\r\nheights; the apices of the Trochi were often worn down; the little\r\nholes made by burrowing animals were greatly enlarged; and the\r\nConcholepas was often perforated quite through, owing to the inner\r\nplates of shell having scaled off.\r\n\r\nMany of these shells, as I have said, were packed in, and were quite\r\nfilled with, blackish or reddish-brown earth, resting on the granitic\r\ndetritus. I did not doubt until lately that this mould was of purely\r\nterrestrial origin, when with a microscope examining some of it from\r\nthe inside of a Concholepas from the height of about one hundred feet,\r\nI found that it was in considerable part composed of minute fragments\r\nof the spines, mouth- bones, and shells of Echini, and of minute\r\nfragments, of chiefly very young Patellae, Mytili, and other species. I\r\nfound similar microscopical fragments in earth filling up the central\r\norifices of some large Fissurellae. This earth when crushed emits a\r\nsickly smell, precisely like that from garden-mould mixed with guano.\r\nThe earth accidentally preserved within the shells, from the greater\r\nheights, has the same general appearance, but it is a little redder; it\r\nemits the same smell when rubbed, but I was unable to detect with\r\ncertainty any marine remains in it. This earth resembles in general\r\nappearance, as before remarked, that capping the rocks of Quiriquina in\r\nthe Bay of Concepcion, on which beds of sea-shells lay. I have, also,\r\nshown that the black, peaty soil, in which the shells at the height of\r\n350 feet at Chiloe were packed, contained many minute fragments of\r\nmarine animals. These facts appear to me interesting, as they show that\r\nsoils, which would naturally be considered of purely terrestrial\r\nnature, may owe their origin in chief part to the sea.\r\n\r\nBeing well aware from what I have seen at Chiloe and in Tierra del\r\nFuego, that vast quantities of shells are carried, during successive\r\nages, far inland, where the inhabitants chiefly subsist on these\r\nproductions, I am bound to state that at greater heights than 557 feet,\r\nwhere the number of very young and small shells proved that they had\r\nnot been carried up for food, the only evidence of the shells having\r\nbeen naturally left by the sea, consists in their invariable and\r\nuniform appearance of extreme antiquity—in the distance of some of the\r\nplaces from the coast, in others being inaccessible from the nearest\r\npart of the beach, and in the absence of fresh water for men to\r\ndrink—in the shells NOT LYING IN HEAPS,—and, lastly, in the close\r\nsimilarity of the soil in which they are embedded, to that which lower\r\ndown can be unequivocally shown to be in great part formed from the\r\ndebris of the sea animals. (In the “Proceedings of the Geological\r\nSociety” volume 2 page 446, I have given a brief account of the\r\nupraised shells on the coast of Chile, and have there stated that the\r\nproofs of elevation are not satisfactory above the height of 230 feet.\r\nI had at that time unfortunately overlooked a separate page written\r\nduring my second visit to Valparaiso, describing the shells now in my\r\npossession from the 557 feet hill; I had not then unpacked my\r\ncollections, and had not reconsidered the obvious appearance of greater\r\nantiquity of the shells from the greater heights, nor had I at that\r\ntime discovered the marine origin of the earth in which many of the\r\nshells are packed. Considering these facts, I do not now feel a shadow\r\nof doubt that the shells, at the height of 1,300 feet, have been\r\nupraised by natural causes into their present position.)\r\n\r\nWith respect to the position in which the shells lie, I was repeatedly\r\nstruck here, at Concepcion, and at other places, with the frequency of\r\ntheir occurrence on the summits and edges either of separate hills, or\r\nof little flat headlands often terminating precipitously over the sea.\r\nThe several above-enumerated species of mollusca, which are found\r\nstrewed on the surface of the land from a few feet above the level of\r\nthe sea up to the height of 1,300 feet, all now live either on the\r\nbeach, or at only a few fathoms’ depth: Mr. Edmondston, in a letter to\r\nProfessor E. Forbes, states that in dredging in the Bay of Valparaiso,\r\nhe found the common species of Concholepas, Fissurella, Trochus,\r\nMonoceros, Chitons, etc., living in abundance from the beach to a depth\r\nof seven fathoms; and dead shells occurred only a few fathoms deeper.\r\nThe common Turritella cingulata was dredged up living at even from ten\r\nto fifteen fathoms; but this is a species which I did not find here\r\namongst the upraised shells. Considering this fact of the species being\r\nall littoral or sub-littoral, considering their occurrence at various\r\nheights, their vast numbers, and their generally comminuted state,\r\nthere can be little doubt that they were left on successive beach-lines\r\nduring a gradual elevation of the land. The presence, however, of so\r\nmany whole and perfectly preserved shells appears at first a difficulty\r\non this view, considering that the coast is exposed to the full force\r\nof an open ocean: but we may suppose, either that these shells were\r\nthrown during gales on flat ledges of rock just above the level of\r\nhigh-water mark, and that during the elevation of the land they are\r\nnever again touched by the waves, or, that during earthquakes, such as\r\nthose of 1822, 1835, and 1837, rocky reefs covered with marine-animals\r\nwere it one blow uplifted above the future reach of the sea. This\r\nlatter explanation is, perhaps, the most probable one with respect to\r\nthe beds at Concepcion entirely composed of the Mytilus Chiloensis, a\r\nspecies which lives below the lowest tides; and likewise with respect\r\nto the great beds occurring both north and south of Valparaiso, of the\r\nMesodesma donaciforme,—a shell which, as I am informed by Mr. Cuming,\r\ninhabits sandbanks at the level of the lowest tides. But even in the\r\ncase of shells having the habits of this Mytilus and Mesodesma, beds of\r\nthem, wherever the sea gently throws up sand or mud, and thus protects\r\nits own accumulations, might be upraised by the slowest movement, and\r\nyet remain undisturbed by the waves of each new beach-line.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of remark, that nowhere near Valparaiso above the height\r\nof twenty feet, or rarely of fifty feet, I saw any lines of erosion on\r\nthe solid rocks, or any beds of pebbles; this, I believe, may be\r\naccounted for by the disintegrating tendency of most of the rocks in\r\nthis neighbourhood. Nor is the land here modelled into terraces: Mr.\r\nAlison, however, informs me, that on both sides of one narrow ravine,\r\nat the height of 300 feet above the sea, he found a succession of\r\nrather indistinct step-formed beaches, composed of broken shells, which\r\ntogether covered a space of about eighty feet vertical.\r\n\r\nI can add nothing to the accounts already published of the elevation of\r\nthe land at Valparaiso, which accompanied the earthquake of 1822 (Dr.\r\nMeyen “Reise um Erde” Th. 1 s. 221, found in 1831 seaweed and other\r\nbodies still adhering to some rocks which during the shock of 1822 were\r\nlifted above the sea.): but I heard it confidently asserted, that a\r\nsentinel on duty, immediately after the shock, saw a part of a fort,\r\nwhich previously was not within the line of his vision, and this would\r\nindicate that the uplifting was not horizontal: it would even appear\r\nfrom some facts collected by Mr. Alison, that only the eastern half of\r\nthe bay was then elevated. Through the kindness of this same gentleman,\r\nI am able to give an interesting account of the changes of level, which\r\nhave supervened here within historical periods: about the year 1680 a\r\nlong sea-wall (or Prefil) was built, of which only a few fragments now\r\nremain; up to the year 1817, the sea often broke over it, and washed\r\nthe houses on the opposite side of the road (where the prison now\r\nstands); and even in 1819, Mr. J. Martin remembers walking at the foot\r\nof this wall, and being often obliged to climb over it to escape the\r\nwaves. There now stands (1834) on the seaward side of this wall, and\r\nbetween it and the beach, in one part a single row of houses, and in\r\nanother part two rows with a street between them. This great extension\r\nof the beach in so short a time cannot be attributed simply to the\r\naccumulation of detritus; for a resident engineer measured for me the\r\nheight between the lowest part of the wall visible, and the present\r\nbeach-line at spring-tides, and the difference was eleven feet six\r\ninches. The church of S. Augustin is believed to have been built in\r\n1614, and there is a tradition that the sea formerly flowed very near\r\nit; by levelling, its foundations were found to stand nineteen feet six\r\ninches above the highest beach-line; so that we see in a period of 220\r\nyears, the elevation cannot have been as much as nineteen feet six\r\ninches. From the facts given with respect to the sea-wall, and from the\r\ntestimony of the elder inhabitants, it appears certain that the change\r\nin level began to be manifest about the year 1817. The only sudden\r\nelevation of which there is any record occurred in 1822, and this seems\r\nto have been less than three feet. Since that year, I was assured by\r\nseveral competent observers, that part of an old wreck, which is firmly\r\nembedded near the beach, has sensibly emerged; hence here, as at\r\nChiloe, a slow rise of the land appears to be now in progress. It seems\r\nhighly probable that the rocks which are corroded in a band at the\r\nheight of fourteen feet above the sea were acted on during the period,\r\nwhen by tradition the base of S. Augustin church, now nineteen feet six\r\ninches above the highest water-mark, was occasionally washed by the\r\nwaves.\r\n\r\nVALPARAISO TO COQUIMBO.\r\n\r\nFor the first seventy-five miles north of Valparaiso I followed the\r\ncoast- road, and throughout this space I observed innumerable masses of\r\nupraised shells. About Quintero there are immense accumulations (worked\r\nfor lime) of the Mesodesma donaciforme, packed in sandy earth; they\r\nabound chiefly about fifteen feet above high-water, but shells are here\r\nfound, according to Mr. Miers, to a height of 500 feet, and at a\r\ndistance of three leagues from the coast (“Travels in Chile” volume 1\r\npages 395, 458. I received several similar accounts from the\r\ninhabitants, and was assured that there are many shells on the plain of\r\nCasa Blanca, between Valparaiso and Santiago, at the height of 800\r\nfeet.): I here noticed barnacles adhering to the rocks three or four\r\nfeet above the highest tides. In the neighbourhood of Plazilla and\r\nCatapilco, at heights of between two hundred and three hundred feet,\r\nthe number of comminuted shells, with some perfect ones, especially of\r\nthe Mesodesma, packed in layers, was truly immense: the land at\r\nPlazilla had evidently existed as a bay, with abrupt rocky masses\r\nrising out of it, precisely like the islets in the broken bays now\r\nindenting this coast. On both sides of the rivers Ligua, Longotomo,\r\nGuachen, and Quilimari, there are plains of gravel about two hundred\r\nfeet in height, in many parts absolutely covered with shells. Close to\r\nConchalee, a gravel-plain is fronted by a lower and similar plain about\r\nsixty feet in height, and this again is separated from the beach by a\r\nwide tract of low land: the surfaces of all three plains or terraces\r\nwere strewed with vast numbers of the Concholepas, Mesodesma, an\r\nexisting Venus, and other still existing littoral shells. The two upper\r\nterraces closely resemble in miniature the plains of Patagonia; and\r\nlike them are furrowed by dry, flat-bottomed, winding valleys.\r\nNorthward of this place I turned inward; and therefore found no more\r\nshells: but the valleys of Chuapa, Illapel, and Limari, are bounded by\r\ngravel-capped plains, often including a lower terrace within. These\r\nplains send bay-like arms between and into the surrounding hills; and\r\nthey are continuously united with other extensive gravel-capped plains,\r\nseparating the coast mountain-ranges from the Cordillera.\r\n\r\nCOQUIMBO.\r\n\r\nA narrow fringe-like plain, gently inclined towards the sea, here\r\nextends for eleven miles along the coast, with arms stretching up\r\nbetween the coast-mountains, and likewise up the valley of Coquimbo: at\r\nits southern extremity it is directly connected with the plain of\r\nLimari, out of which hills abruptly rise like islets, and other hills\r\nproject like headlands on a coast. The surface of the fringe-like plain\r\nappears level, but differs insensibly in height, and greatly in\r\ncomposition, in different parts.\r\n\r\nAt the mouth of the valley of Coquimbo, the surface consists wholly of\r\ngravel, and stands from 300 to 350 feet above the level of the sea,\r\nbeing about one hundred feet higher than in other parts. In these other\r\nand lower parts the superficial beds consist of calcareous matter, and\r\nrest on ancient tertiary deposits hereafter to be described. The\r\nuppermost calcareous layer is cream-coloured, compact,\r\nsmooth-fractured, sub- stalactiform, and contains some sand, earthy\r\nmatter, and recent shells. It lies on, and sends wedge-like veins into,\r\na much more friable, calcareous, tuff-like variety; and both rest on a\r\nmass about twenty feet in thickness, formed of fragments of recent\r\nshells, with a few whole ones, and with small pebbles firmly cemented\r\ntogether. (In many respects this upper hard, and the underlying more\r\nfriable, varieties, resemble the great superficial beds at King\r\nGeorge’s Sound in Australia, which I have described in my “Geological\r\nObservations on Volcanic Islands.” There could be little doubt that the\r\nupper layers there have been hardened by the action of rain on the\r\nfriable, calcareous matter, and that the whole mass has originated in\r\nthe decay of minutely comminuted sea-shells and corals.) This latter\r\nrock is called by the inhabitants losa, and is used for building: in\r\nmany parts it is divided into strata, which dip at an angle of ten\r\ndegrees seaward, and appear as if they had originally been heaped in\r\nsuccessive layers (as may be seen on coral-reefs) on a steep beach.\r\nThis stone is remarkable from being in parts entirely formed of empty,\r\npellucid capsules or cells of calcareous matter, of the size of small\r\nseeds: a series of specimens unequivocally showed that all these\r\ncapsules once contained minute rounded fragments of shells which have\r\nsince been gradually dissolved by water percolating through the mass.\r\n(I have incidentally described this rock in the above work on Volcanic\r\nIslands.)\r\n\r\nThe shells embedded in the calcareous beds forming the surface of this\r\nfringe-like plain, at the height of from 200 to 250 feet above the sea,\r\nconsist of:—\r\n\r\n1. Venus opaca. 2. Mulinia Byronensis. 3. Pecten purpuratus. 4.\r\nMesodesma donaciforme. 5. Turritella cingulata. 6. Monoceros costatum.\r\n7. Concholepas Peruviana. 8. Trochus (common Valparaiso species). 9.\r\nCalyptraea Byronensis.\r\n\r\nAlthough these species are all recent, and are all found in the\r\nneighbouring sea, yet I was particularly struck with the difference in\r\nthe proportional numbers of the several species, and of those now cast\r\nup on the present beach. I found only one specimen of the Concholepas,\r\nand the Pecten was very rare, though both these shells are now the\r\ncommonest kinds, with the exception, perhaps, of the Calyptraea\r\nradians, of which I did not find one in the calcareous beds. I will not\r\npretend to determine how far this difference in the proportional\r\nnumbers depends on the age of the deposit, and how far on the\r\ndifference in nature between the present sandy beaches and the\r\ncalcareous bottom, on which the embedded shells must have lived.\r\n\r\n(DIAGRAM 8.—SECTION OF PLAIN OF COQUIMBO.\r\n\r\nA Section through Plain B-B and Ravine A.\r\n\r\nSurface of plain 252 feet above sea.\r\n\r\nA. Stratified sand, with recent shells in same proportions as on the\r\nbeach, half filling up a ravine.\r\n\r\nB. Surface of plain, with scattered shells in nearly same proportions\r\nas on the beach.\r\n\r\nC. Upper calcareous bed, and D. Lower calcareous sandy bed (Losa), both\r\nwith recent shells, but not in same proportions as on the beach.\r\n\r\nE. Upper ferrugino-sandy old tertiary stratum, and F. Lower old\r\ntertiary stratum, both with all, or nearly all, extinct shells.)\r\n\r\nOn the bare surface of the calcareous plain, or in a thin covering of\r\nsand, there were lying, at a height from 200 to 252 feet, many recent\r\nshells, which had a much fresher appearance than the embedded ones:\r\nfragments of the Concholepas, and of the common Mytilus, still\r\nretaining a tinge of its colour, were numerous, and altogether there\r\nwas manifestly a closer approach in proportional numbers to those now\r\nlying on the beach. In a mass of stratified, slightly agglutinated\r\nsand, which in some places covers up the lower half of the seaward\r\nescarpment of the plain, the included shells appeared to be in exactly\r\nthe same proportional numbers with those on the beach. On one side of a\r\nsteep-sided ravine, cutting through the plain behind Herradura Bay, I\r\nobserved a narrow strip of stratified sand, containing similar shells\r\nin similar proportional numbers; a section of the ravine is represented\r\nin Diagram 8, which serves also to show the general composition of the\r\nplain. I mention this case of the ravine chiefly because without the\r\nevidence of the marine shells in the sand, any one would have supposed\r\nthat it had been hollowed out by simple alluvial action.\r\n\r\nThe escarpment of the fringe-like plain, which stretches for eleven\r\nmiles along the coast, is in some parts fronted by two or three narrow,\r\nstep- formed terraces, one of which at Herradura Bay expands into a\r\nsmall plain. Its surface was there formed of gravel, cemented together\r\nby calcareous matter; and out of it I extracted the following recent\r\nshells, which are in a more perfect condition than those from the upper\r\nplain:—\r\n\r\n1. Calyptraea radians. 2. Turritella cingulata. 3. Oliva Peruviana. 4.\r\nMurex labiosus, var. 5. Nassa (identical with a living species). 6.\r\nSolen Dombeiana. 7. Pecten purpuratus. 8. Venus Chilensis. 9.\r\nAmphidesma rugulosum. The small irregular wrinkles of the posterior\r\npart of this shell are rather stronger than in the recent specimens of\r\nthis species from Coquimbo. (G.B. Sowerby.) 10. Balanus (identical with\r\nliving species).\r\n\r\nOn the syenitic ridge, which forms the southern boundary of Herradura\r\nBay and Plain, I found the Concholepas and Turritella cingulata (mostly\r\nin fragments), at the height of 242 feet above the sea. I could not\r\nhave told that these shells had not formerly been brought up by man, if\r\nI had not found one very small mass of them cemented together in a\r\nfriable calcareous tuff. I mention this fact more particularly, because\r\nI carefully looked, in many apparently favourable spots, at lesser\r\nheights on the side of this ridge, and could not find even the smallest\r\nfragment of a shell. This is only one instance out of many, proving\r\nthat the absence of sea-shells on the surface, though in many respects\r\ninexplicable, is an argument of very little weight in opposition to\r\nother evidence on the recent elevation of the land. The highest point\r\nin this neighbourhood at which I found upraised shells of existing\r\nspecies was on an inland calcareous plain, at the height of 252 feet\r\nabove the sea.\r\n\r\nIt would appear from Mr. Caldcleugh’s researches, that a rise has taken\r\nplace here within the last century and a half (“Proceedings of the\r\nGeological Society” volume 2 page 446.); and as no sudden change of\r\nlevel has been observed during the not very severe earthquakes, which\r\nhave occasionally occurred here, the rising has probably been slow,\r\nlike that now, or quite lately, in progress at Chiloe and at\r\nValparaiso: there are three well-known rocks, called the Pelicans,\r\nwhich in 1710, according to Feuillee, were a fleur d’eau, but now are\r\nsaid to stand twelve feet above low-water mark: the spring-tides rise\r\nhere only five feet. There is another rock, now nine feet above\r\nhigh-water mark, which in the time of Frezier and Feuillee rose only\r\nfive or six feet out of water. Mr. Caldcleugh, I may add, also shows\r\n(and I received similar accounts) that there has been a considerable\r\ndecrease in the soundings during the last twelve years in the Bays of\r\nCoquimbo, Concepcion, Valparaiso, and Guasco; but as in these cases it\r\nis nearly impossible to distinguish between the accumulation of\r\nsediment and the upheavement of the bottom, I have not entered into any\r\ndetails.\r\n\r\nVALLEY OF COQUIMBO.\r\n\r\n(FIGURE 9. EAST AND WEST SECTION THROUGH THE TERRACES AT COQUIMBO,\r\nWHERE THEY DEBOUCH FROM THE VALLEY, AND FRONT THE SEA.\r\n\r\nVertical scale 1/10 of inch to 100 feet: horizontal scale much\r\ncontracted.\r\n\r\nHeight of terrace in feet from east (high) to west (low): Terrace F.\r\n364 Terrace E. 302 Terrace D. shown dotted, height not given. Terrace\r\nC. 120 Terrace B. 70 Terrace A. 25 sloping down to level of sea at Town\r\nof Coquimbo.)\r\n\r\nThe narrow coast-plain sends, as before stated, an arm, or more\r\ncorrectly a fringe, on both sides, but chiefly on the southern side,\r\nseveral miles up the valley. These fringes are worn into steps or\r\nterraces, which present a most remarkable appearance, and have been\r\ncompared (though not very correctly) by Captain Basil Hall, to the\r\nparallel roads of Glen Roy in Scotland: their origin has been ably\r\ndiscussed by Mr. Lyell. (“Principles of Geology” 1st edition volume 3\r\npage 131.) The first section which I will give (Figure 9), is not drawn\r\nacross the valley, but in an east and west line at its mouth, where the\r\nstep-formed terraces debouch and present their very gently inclined\r\nsurfaces towards the Pacific.\r\n\r\nThe bottom plain (A) is about a mile in width, and rises quite\r\ninsensibly from the beach to a height of twenty-five feet at the foot\r\nof the next plain; it is sandy, and abundantly strewed with shells.\r\n\r\nPlain or terrace B is of small extent, and is almost concealed by the\r\nhouses of the town, as is likewise the escarpment of terrace C. On both\r\nsides of a ravine, two miles south of the town, there are two little\r\nterraces, one above the other, evidently corresponding with B and C;\r\nand on them marine remains of the species already enumerated were\r\nplentiful. Terrace E is very narrow, but quite distinct and level; a\r\nlittle southward of the town there were traces of a terrace D\r\nintermediate between E and C. Terrace F is part of the fringe-like\r\nplain, which stretches for the eleven miles along the coast; it is here\r\ncomposed of shingle, and is 100 feet higher than where composed of\r\ncalcareous matter. This greater height is obviously due to the quantity\r\nof shingle, which at some former period has been brought down the great\r\nvalley of Coquimbo.\r\n\r\nConsidering the many shells strewed over the terraces A, B, and C, and\r\na few miles southward on the calcareous plain, which is continuously\r\nunited with the upper step-like plain F, there cannot, I apprehend, be\r\nany doubt, that these six terraces have been formed by the action of\r\nthe sea; and that their five escarpments mark so many periods of\r\ncomparative rest in the elevatory movement, during which the sea wore\r\ninto the land. The elevation between these periods may have been sudden\r\nand on AN AVERAGE not more than seventy-two feet each time, or it may\r\nhave been gradual and insensibly slow. From the shells on the three\r\nlower terraces, and on the upper one, and I may add on the three\r\ngravel-capped terraces at Conchalee, being all littoral and\r\nsub-littoral species, and from the analogical facts given at\r\nValparaiso, and lastly from the evidence of a slow rising lately or\r\nstill in progress here, it appears to me far more probable that the\r\nmovement has been slow. The existence of these successive escarpments,\r\nor old cliff- lines, is in another respect highly instructive, for they\r\nshow periods of comparative rest in the elevatory movement, and of\r\ndenudation, which would never even have been suspected from a close\r\nexamination of many miles of coast southward of Coquimbo.\r\n\r\n(FIGURE 10. NORTH AND SOUTH SECTION ACROSS THE VALLEY OF COQUIMBO.\r\n\r\nFrom north F (high) through E?, D, C, B, A (low), B?, C, D?, E, F\r\n(high).\r\n\r\nVertical scale 1/10 of inch to 100 feet: horizontal scale much\r\ncontracted.\r\n\r\nTerraces marked with ? do not occur on that side of the valley, and are\r\nintroduced only to make the diagram more intelligible. A river and\r\nbottom- plain of valley C, E, and F, on the south side of valley, are\r\nrespectively, 197, 377, and 420 feet above the level of the sea.\r\n\r\nAA. The bottom of the valley, believed to be 100 feet above the sea: it\r\nis continuously united with the lowest plain A of Figure 9.\r\n\r\nB. This terrace higher up the valley expands considerably; seaward it\r\nis soon lost, its escarpment being united with that of C: it is not\r\ndeveloped at all on the south side of the valley.\r\n\r\nC. This terrace, like the last, is considerably expanded higher up the\r\nvalley. These two terraces apparently correspond with B and C of Figure\r\n9.\r\n\r\nD is not well developed in the line of this section; but seaward it\r\nexpands into a plain: it is not present on the south side of the\r\nvalley; but it is met with, as stated under the former section, a\r\nlittle south of the town.\r\n\r\nE is well developed on the south side, but absent on the north side of\r\nthe valley: though not continuously united with E of Figure 9, it\r\napparently corresponds with it.\r\n\r\nF. This is the surface-plain, and is continuously united with that\r\nwhich stretches like a fringe along the coast. In ascending the valley\r\nit gradually becomes narrower, and is at last, at the distance of about\r\nten miles from the sea, reduced to a row of flat-topped patches on the\r\nsides of the mountains. None of the lower terraces extend so far up the\r\nvalley.)\r\n\r\nWe come now to the terraces on the opposite sides of the east and west\r\nvalley of Coquimbo: the section in Figure 10 is taken in a north and\r\nsouth line across the valley at a point about three miles from the sea.\r\nThe valley measured from the edges of the escarpments of the upper\r\nplain FF is about a mile in width; but from the bases of the bounding\r\nmountains it is from three to four miles wide. The terraces marked with\r\nan interrogative do not exist on that side of the valley, but are\r\nintroduced merely to render the diagram more intelligible.\r\n\r\nThese five terraces are formed of shingle and sand; three of them, as\r\nmarked by Captain B. Hall (namely, B, C, and F), are much more\r\nconspicuous than the others. From the marine remains copiously strewed\r\nat the mouth of the valley on the lower terraces, and southward of the\r\ntown on the upper one, they are, as before remarked, undoubtedly of\r\nmarine origin; but within the valley, and this fact well deserves\r\nnotice, at a distance of from only a mile and a half to three or four\r\nmiles from the sea, I could not find even a fragment of a shell.\r\n\r\nON THE INCLINATION OF THE TERRACES OF COQUIMBO, AND ON THE UPPER AND\r\nBASAL EDGES OF THEIR ESCARPMENTS NOT BEING HORIZONTAL.\r\n\r\nThe surfaces of these terraces slope in a slight degree, as shown by\r\nthe sections in Figures 9 and 10 taken conjointly, both towards the\r\ncentre of the valley, and seawards towards its mouth. This double or\r\ndiagonal inclination, which is not the same in the several terraces,\r\nis, as we shall immediately see, of simple explanation. There are,\r\nhowever, some other points which at first appear by no means\r\nobvious,—namely, first, that each terrace, taken in its whole breadth\r\nfrom the summit-edge of one escarpment to the base of that above it,\r\nand followed up the valley, is not horizontal; nor have the several\r\nterraces, when followed up the valley, all the same inclination; thus I\r\nfound the terraces C, E, and F, measured at a point about two miles\r\nfrom the mouth of the valley, stood severally between fifty-six to\r\nseventy-seven feet higher than at the mouth. Again, if we look to any\r\none line of cliff or escarpment, neither its summit-edge nor its base\r\nis horizontal. On the theory of the terraces having been formed during\r\na slow and equable rise of the land, with as many intervals of rest as\r\nthere are escarpments, it appears at first very surprising that\r\nhorizontal lines of some kind should not have been left on the land.\r\n\r\nThe direction of the diagonal inclination in the different terraces\r\nbeing different,—in some being directed more towards the middle of the\r\nvalley, in others more towards its mouth,—naturally follows on the view\r\nof each terrace, being an accumulation of successive beach-lines round\r\nbays, which must have been of different forms and sizes when the land\r\nstood at different levels: for if we look to the actual beach of a\r\nnarrow creek, its slope is directed towards the middle; whereas, in an\r\nopen bay, or slight concavity on a coast, the slope is towards the\r\nmouth, that is, almost directly seaward; hence as a bay alters in form\r\nand size, so will the direction of the inclination of its successive\r\nbeaches become changed.\r\n\r\n(FIGURE 11. DIAGRAM OF A BAY IN A DISTRICT WHICH HAS BEGUN SLOWLY\r\nRISING)\r\n\r\nIf it were possible to trace any one of the many beach-lines, composing\r\neach sloping terrace, it would of course be horizontal; but the only\r\nlines of demarcation are the summit and basal edges of the escarpments.\r\nNow the summit-edge of one of these escarpments marks the furthest line\r\nor point to which the sea has cut into a mass of gravel sloping\r\nseaward; and as the sea will generally have greater power at the mouth\r\nthan at the protected head of the bay, so will the escarpment at the\r\nmouth be cut deeper into the land, and its summit-edge be higher;\r\nconsequently it will not be horizontal. With respect to the basal or\r\nlower edges of the escarpments, from picturing in one’s mind ancient\r\nbays ENTIRELY surrounded at successive periods by cliff-formed shores,\r\none’s first impression is that they at least necessarily must be\r\nhorizontal, if the elevation has been horizontal. But here is a\r\nfallacy: for after the sea has, during a cessation of the elevation,\r\nworn cliffs all round the shores of a bay, when the movement\r\nrecommences, and especially if it recommences slowly, it might well\r\nhappen that, at the exposed mouth of the bay, the waves might continue\r\nfor some time wearing into the land, whilst in the protected and upper\r\nparts successive beach-lines might be accumulating in a sloping surface\r\nor terrace at the foot of the cliffs which had been lately reached:\r\nhence, supposing the whole line of escarpment to be finally uplifted\r\nabove the reach of the sea, its basal line or foot near the mouth will\r\nrun at a lower level than in the upper and protected parts of the bay;\r\nconsequently this basal line will not be horizontal. And it has already\r\nbeen shown that the summit-edges of each escarpment will generally be\r\nhigher near the mouth (from the seaward sloping land being there most\r\nexposed and cut into) than near the head of the bay; therefore the\r\ntotal height of the escarpments will be greatest near the mouth; and\r\nfurther up the old bay or valley they will on both sides generally thin\r\nout and die away: I have observed this thinning out of the successive\r\nescarpment at other places besides Coquimbo; and for a long time I was\r\nquite unable to understand its meaning. The rude diagram in Figure 11\r\nwill perhaps render what I mean more intelligible; it represents a bay\r\nin a district which has begun slowly rising. Before the movement\r\ncommenced, it is supposed that the waves had been enabled to eat into\r\nthe land and form cliffs, as far up, but with gradually diminishing\r\npower, as the points AA: after the movement had commenced and gone on\r\nfor a little time, the sea is supposed still to have retained the\r\npower, at the exposed mouth of the bay, of cutting down and into the\r\nland as it slowly emerged; but in the upper parts of the bay it is\r\nsupposed soon to have lost this power, owing to the more protected\r\nsituation and to the quantity of detritus brought down by the river;\r\nconsequently low land was there accumulated. As this low land was\r\nformed during a slow elevatory movement, its surface will gently slope\r\nupwards from the beach on all sides. Now, let us imagine the bay, not\r\nto make the diagram more complicated, suddenly converted into a valley:\r\nthe basal line of the cliffs will of course be horizontal, as far as\r\nthe beach is now seen extending in the diagram; but in the upper part\r\nof the valley, this line will be higher, the level of the district\r\nhaving been raised whilst the low land was accumulating at the foot of\r\nthe inland cliffs. If, instead of the bay in the diagram being suddenly\r\nconverted into a valley, we suppose with much more probability it to be\r\nupraised slowly, then the waves in the upper parts of the bay will\r\ncontinue very gradually to fail to reach the cliffs, which are now in\r\nthe diagram represented as washed by the sea, and which, consequently,\r\nwill be left standing higher and higher above its level; whilst at the\r\nstill exposed mouth, it might well happen that the waves might be\r\nenabled to cut deeper and deeper, both down and into the cliffs, as the\r\nland slowly rose.\r\n\r\nThe greater or lesser destroying power of the waves at the mouths of\r\nsuccessive bays, comparatively with this same power in their upper and\r\nprotected parts, will vary as the bays become changed in form and size,\r\nand therefore at different levels, at their mouths and heads, more or\r\nless of the surfaces between the escarpments (that is, the accumulated\r\nbeach-lines or terraces) will be left undestroyed: from what has gone\r\nbefore we can see that, according as the elevatory movements after each\r\ncessation recommence more or less slowly, according to the amount of\r\ndetritus delivered by the river at the heads of the successive bays,\r\nand according to the degree of protection afforded by their altered\r\nforms, so will a greater or less extent of terrace be accumulated in\r\nthe upper part, to which there will be no surface at a corresponding\r\nlevel at the mouth: hence we can perceive why no one terrace, taken in\r\nits whole breadth and followed up the valley, is horizontal, though\r\neach separate beach-line must have been so; and why the inclination of\r\nthe several terraces, both transversely, and longitudinally up the\r\nvalley, is not alike.\r\n\r\nI have entered into this case in some detail, for I was long perplexed\r\n(and others have felt the same difficulty) in understanding how, on the\r\nidea of an equable elevation with the sea at intervals eating into the\r\nland, it came that neither the terraces nor the upper nor lower edges\r\nof the escarpments were horizontal. Along lines of coast, even of great\r\nlengths, such as that of Patagonia, if they are nearly uniformly\r\nexposed, the corroding power of the waves will be checked and conquered\r\nby the elevatory movement, as often as it recommences, at about the\r\nsame period; and hence the terraces, or accumulated beach-lines, will\r\ncommence being formed at nearly the same levels: at each succeeding\r\nperiod of rest, they will, also, be eaten into at nearly the same rate,\r\nand consequently there will be a much closer coincidence in their\r\nlevels and inclinations, than in the terraces and escarpments formed\r\nround bays with their different parts very differently exposed to the\r\naction of the sea. It is only where the waves are enabled, after a long\r\nlapse of time, slowly to corrode hard rocks, or to throw up, owing to\r\nthe supply of sediment being small and to the surface being steeply\r\ninclined, a narrow beach or mound, that we can expect, as at Glen Roy\r\nin Scotland (“Philosophical Transactions” 1839 page 39.), a distinct\r\nline marking an old sea-level, and which will be strictly horizontal,\r\nif the subsequent elevatory movements have been so: for in these cases\r\nno discernible effects will be produced, except during the long\r\nintervening periods of rest; whereas in the case of step-formed coasts,\r\nsuch as those described in this and the preceding chapter, the terraces\r\nthemselves are accumulated during the slow elevatory process, the\r\naccumulation commencing sooner in protected than in exposed situations,\r\nand sooner where there is copious supply of detritus than where there\r\nis little; on the other hand, the steps or escarpments are formed\r\nduring the stationary periods, and are more deeply cut down and into\r\nthe coast-land in exposed than in protected situations;—the cutting\r\naction, moreover, being prolonged in the most exposed parts, both\r\nduring the beginning and ending, if slow, of the upward movement.\r\n\r\nAlthough in the foregoing discussion I have assumed the elevation to\r\nhave been horizontal, it may be suspected, from the considerable\r\nseaward slope of the terraces, both up the valley of S. Cruz and up\r\nthat of Coquimbo, that the rising has been greater inland than nearer\r\nthe coast. There is reason to believe (Mr. Place in the “Quarterly\r\nJournal of Science” 1824 volume 17 page 42.), from the effects produced\r\non the water-course of a mill during the earthquake of 1822 in Chile,\r\nthat the upheaval one mile inland was nearly double, namely, between\r\nfive and seven feet, to what it was on the Pacific. We know, also, from\r\nthe admirable researches of M. Bravais, that in Scandinavia the ancient\r\nsea-beaches gently slope from the interior mountain-ranges towards the\r\ncoast, and that they are not parallel one to the other (“Voyages de la\r\nComm. du Nord” etc. also “Comptes Rendus” October 1842.), showing that\r\nthe proportional difference in the amount of elevation on the coast and\r\nin the interior, varied at different periods.\r\n\r\nCOQUIMBO TO GUASCO.\r\n\r\nIn this distance of ninety miles, I found in almost every part marine\r\nshells up to a height of apparently from two hundred to three hundred\r\nfeet. The desert plain near Choros is thus covered; it is bounded by\r\nthe escarpment of a higher plain, consisting of pale-coloured, earthy,\r\ncalcareous stone, like that of Coquimbo, with the same recent shells\r\nembedded in it. In the valley of Chaneral, a similar bed occurs in\r\nwhich, differently from that of Coquimbo, I observed many shells of the\r\nConcholepas: near Guasco the same calcareous bed is likewise met with.\r\n\r\nIn the valley of Guasco, the step-formed terraces of gravel are\r\ndisplaced in a more striking manner than at any other point. I followed\r\nthe valley for thirty-seven miles (as reckoned by the inhabitants) from\r\nthe coast to Ballenar; in nearly the whole of this distance, five grand\r\nterraces, running at corresponding heights on both sides of the broad\r\nvalley, are more conspicuous than the three best-developed ones at\r\nCoquimbo. They give to the landscape the most singular and formal\r\naspect; and when the clouds hung low, hiding the neighbouring\r\nmountains, the valley resembled in the most striking manner that of\r\nSanta Cruz. The whole thickness of these terraces or plains seems\r\ncomposed of gravel, rather firmly aggregated together, with occasional\r\nparting seams of clay: the pebbles on the upper plain are often\r\nwhitewashed with an aluminous substance, as in Patagonia. Near the\r\ncoast I observed many sea-shells on the lower plains. At Freyrina\r\n(twelve miles up the valley), there are six terraces beside the bottom-\r\nsurface of the valley: the two lower ones are here only from two\r\nhundred to three hundred yards in width, but higher up the valley they\r\nexpand into plains; the third terrace is generally narrow; the fourth I\r\nsaw only in one place, but there it was distinct for the length of a\r\nmile; the fifth is very broad; the sixth is the summit-plain, which\r\nexpands inland into a great basin. Not having a barometer with me, I\r\ndid not ascertain the height of these plains, but they appeared\r\nconsiderably higher than those at Coquimbo. Their width varies much,\r\nsometimes being very broad, and sometimes contracting into mere fringes\r\nof separate flat-topped projections, and then quite disappearing: at\r\nthe one spot, where the fourth terrace was visible, the whole six\r\nterraces were cut off for a short space by one single bold escarpment.\r\nNear Ballenar (thirty-seven miles from the mouth of the river), the\r\nvalley between the summit-edges of the highest escarpments is several\r\nmiles in width, and the five terraces on both sides are broadly\r\ndeveloped: the highest cannot be less than six hundred feet above the\r\nbed of the river, which itself must, I conceive, be some hundred feet\r\nabove the sea.\r\n\r\nA north and south section across the valley in this part is represented\r\nin Figure 12.\r\n\r\n(FIGURE 12. NORTH AND SOUTH SECTION ACROSS THE VALLEY OF GUASCO, AND OF\r\nA PLAIN NORTH OF IT.\r\n\r\nFrom left (north, high) to right (south, high) through plains B and A\r\nand the River of Guasco at the Town of Ballenar.)\r\n\r\nOn the northern side of the valley the summit-plain of gravel, A, has\r\ntwo escarpments, one facing the valley, and the other a great\r\nbasin-like plain, B, which stretches for several leagues northward.\r\nThis narrow plain, A, with the double escarpment, evidently once formed\r\na spit or promontory of gravel, projecting into and dividing two great\r\nbays, and subsequently was worn on both sides into steep cliffs.\r\nWhether the several escarpments in this valley were formed during the\r\nsame stationary periods with those of Coquimbo, I will not pretend to\r\nconjecture; but if so the intervening and subsequent elevatory\r\nmovements must have been here much more energetic, for these plains\r\ncertainly stand at a much higher level than do those of Coquimbo.\r\n\r\nCOPIAPO.\r\n\r\nFrom Guasco to Copiapo, I followed the road near the foot of the\r\nCordillera, and therefore saw no upraised remains. At the mouth,\r\nhowever, of the valley of Copiapo there is a plain, estimated by Meyen\r\n(“Reise um die Erde” th. 1 s. 372 et seq.) between fifty and seventy\r\nfeet in height, of which the upper part consists chiefly of gravel,\r\nabounding with recent shells, chiefly of the Concholepas, Venus\r\nDombeyi, and Calyptraea trochiformis. A little inland, on a plain\r\nestimated by myself at nearly three hundred feet, the upper stratum was\r\nformed of broken shells and sand cemented by white calcareous matter,\r\nand abounding with embedded recent shells, of which the Mulinia\r\nByronensis and Pecten purpuratus were the most numerous. The lower\r\nplain stretches for some miles southward, and for an unknown distance\r\nnorthward, but not far up the valley; its seaward face, according to\r\nMeyen, is worn into caves above the level of the present beach. The\r\nvalley of Copiapo is much less steeply inclined and less direct in its\r\ncourse than any other valley which I saw in Chile; and its bottom does\r\nnot generally consist of gravel: there are no step-formed terraces in\r\nit, except at one spot near the mouth of the great lateral valley of\r\nthe Despoblado where there are only two, one above the other: lower\r\ndown the valley, in one place I observed that the solid rock had been\r\ncut into the shape of a beach, and was smoothed over with shingle.\r\n\r\nNorthward of Copiapo, in latitude 26 degrees S., the old voyager Wafer\r\nfound immense numbers of sea-shells some miles from the coast.\r\n(Burnett’s “Collection of Voyages” volume 4 page 193.) At Cobija\r\n(latitude 22 degrees 34′) M. d’Orbigny observed beds of gravel and\r\nbroken shells, containing ten species of recent shells; he also found,\r\non projecting points of porphyry, at a height of 300 feet, shells of\r\nConcholepas, Chiton, Calyptraea, Fissurella, and Patella, still\r\nattached to the spots on which they had lived. M. d’Orbigny argues from\r\nthis fact, that the elevation must have been great and sudden (“Voyage,\r\nPart Geolog.” page 94. M. d’Orbigny (page 98), in summing up, says:\r\n“S’il est certain (as he believes) que tous les terrains en pente,\r\ncompris entre la mer et les montagnes sont l’ancien rivage de la mer,\r\non doit supposer, pour l’ensemble, un exhaussement que ce ne serait pas\r\nmoindre de deux cent metres; il faudrait supposer encore que ce\r\nsoulevement n’a point ete graduel;...mais qu’il resulterait d’une seule\r\net meme cause fortuite,” etc. Now, on this view, when the sea was\r\nforming the beach at the foot of the mountains, many shells of\r\nConcholepas, Chiton, Calyptraea, Fissurella, and Patella (which are\r\nknown to live close to the beach), were attached to rocks at a depth of\r\n300 feet, and at a depth of 600 feet several of these same shells were\r\naccumulating in great numbers in horizontal beds. From what I have\r\nmyself seen in dredging, I believe this to be improbable in the highest\r\ndegree, if not impossible; and I think everyone who has read Professor\r\nE. Forbes’s excellent researches on the subject, will without\r\nhesitation agree in this conclusion.): to me it appears far more\r\nprobable that the movement was gradual, with small starts as during the\r\nearthquakes of 1822 and 1835, by which whole beds of shells attached to\r\nthe rocks were lifted above the subsequent reach of the waves. M.\r\nd’Orbigny also found rolled pebbles extending up the mountain to a\r\nheight of at least six hundred feet. At Iquique (latitude 20 degrees\r\n12′ S.), in a great accumulation of sand, at a height estimated between\r\none hundred and fifty and two hundred feet, I observed many large\r\nsea-shells which I thought could not have been blown up by the wind to\r\nthat height. Mr. J.H. Blake has lately described these shells: he\r\nstates that “inland toward the mountains they form a compact uniform\r\nbed, scarcely a trace of the original shells being discernible; but as\r\nwe approach the shore, the forms become gradually more distinct till we\r\nmeet with the living shells on the coast.” (“Silliman’s American\r\nJournal of Science” volume 44 page 2.) This interesting observation,\r\nshowing by the gradual decay of the shells how slowly and gradually the\r\ncoast must have been uplifted, we shall presently see fully confirmed\r\nat Lima. At Arica (latitude 18 degrees 28′), M. d’Orbigny found a great\r\nrange of sand-dunes, fourteen leagues in length, stretching towards\r\nTacna, including recent shells and bones of Cetacea, and reaching up to\r\na height of 300 feet above the sea. (“Voyage” etc. page 101.)\r\nLieutenant Freyer has given some more precise facts: he states (In a\r\nletter to Mr. Lyell “Geological Proceedings” volume 2 page 179.) that\r\nthe Morro of Arica is about four hundred feet high; it is worn into\r\nobscure terraces, on the bare rock of which he found Balini and\r\nMilleporae adhering. At the height of between twenty and thirty feet\r\nthe shells and corals were in a quite fresh state, but at fifty feet\r\nthey were much abraded; there were, however, traces of organic remains\r\nat greater heights. On the road from Tacna to Arequipa, between\r\nLoquimbo and Moquegua, Mr. M. Hamilton found numerous recent sea shells\r\nin sand, at a considerable distance from the sea. (“Edinburgh New\r\nPhilosophical Journal” volume 30 page 155.)\r\n\r\nLIMA.\r\n\r\nNorthward of Arica, I know nothing of the coast for about a space of\r\nfive degrees of latitude; but near Callao, the port of Lima, there is\r\nabundant and very curious evidence of the elevation of the land. The\r\nisland of San Lorenzo is upwards of one thousand feet high; the basset\r\nedges of the strata composing the lower part are worn into three\r\nobscure, narrow, sloping steps or ledges, which can be seen only when\r\nstanding on them: they probably resemble those described by Lieutenant\r\nFreyer at Arica. The surface of the lower ledge, which extends from a\r\nlow cliff overhanging the sea to the foot of the next upper escarpment,\r\nis covered by an enormous accumulation of recent shells. (M. Chevalier,\r\nin the “Voyage of the ‘Bonite’” observed these shells; but his\r\nspecimens were lost.—“L’Institut” 1838 page 151.) The bed is level, and\r\nin some parts more than two feet in thickness; I traced it over a space\r\nof one mile in length, and heard of it in other places: the uppermost\r\npart is eighty-five feet by the barometer above high-water mark. The\r\nshells are packed together, but not stratified: they are mingled with\r\nearth and stones, and are generally covered by a few inches of\r\ndetritus; they rest on a mass of nearly angular fragments of the\r\nunderlying sandstone, sometimes cemented together by common salt. I\r\ncollected eighteen species of shells of all ages and sizes. Several of\r\nthe univalves had evidently long lain dead at the bottom of the sea,\r\nfor their INSIDES were incrusted with Balani and Serpulae. All,\r\naccording to Mr. G.B. Sowerby, are recent species: they consist of:—\r\n\r\n1. Mytilus Magellanicus: same as that found at Valparaiso, and there\r\nstated to be probably distinct from the true M. Magellanicus of the\r\neast coast.\r\n\r\n2. Venus costellata, Sowerby “Zoological Proceedings.”\r\n\r\n3. Pecten purpuratus, Lam.\r\n\r\n4. Chama, probably echinulata, Brod.\r\n\r\n5. Calyptraea Byronensis, Gray.\r\n\r\n6. Calyptraea radians (Trochus, Lam.)\r\n\r\n7. Fissurella affinis, Gray.\r\n\r\n8. Fissurella biradiata, Trembly.\r\n\r\n9. Purpura chocolatta, Duclos.\r\n\r\n10. Purpura Peruviana, Gray.\r\n\r\n11. Purpura labiata, Gray.\r\n\r\n12. Purpura buxea (Murex, Brod.).\r\n\r\n13. Concholepas Peruviana.\r\n\r\n14. Nassa, related to reticulata.\r\n\r\n15. Triton rudis, Brod.\r\n\r\n16. Trochus, not yet described, but well-known and very common.\r\n\r\n17 and 18. Balanus, two species, both common on the coast.\r\n\r\nThese upraised shells appear to be nearly in the same proportional\r\nnumbers- -with the exception of the Crepidulae being more numerous—with\r\nthose on the existing beach. The state of preservation of the different\r\nspecies differed much; but most of them were much corroded, brittle,\r\nand bleached: the upper and lower surfaces of the Concholepas had\r\ngenerally quite scaled off: some of the Trochi and Fissurellae still\r\npartially retain their colours. It is remarkable that these shells,\r\ntaken all together, have fully as ancient an appearance, although the\r\nextremely arid climate appears highly favourable for their\r\npreservation, as those from 1,300 feet at Valparaiso, and certainly a\r\nmore ancient appearance than those from five to six hundred feet from\r\nValparaiso and Concepcion; at which places I have seen grass and other\r\nvegetables actually growing out of the shells. Many of the univalves\r\nhere at San Lorenzo were filled with, and united together by, pure\r\nsalt, probably left by the evaporation of the sea-spray, as the land\r\nslowly emerged. (The underlying sandstone contains true layers of salt;\r\nso that the salt may possibly have come from the beds in the higher\r\nparts of the island; but I think more probably from the sea-spray. It\r\nis generally asserted that rain never falls on the coast of Peru; but\r\nthis is not quite accurate; for, on several days, during our visit, the\r\nso-called Peruvian dew fell in sufficient quantity to make the streets\r\nmuddy, and it would certainly have washed so deliquescent a substance\r\nas salt into the soil. I state this because M. d’Orbigny, in discussing\r\nan analogous subject, supposes that I had forgotten that it never rains\r\non this whole line of coast. See Ulloa’s “Voyage” volume 2 English\r\nTranslation page 67 for an account of the muddy streets of Lima, and on\r\nthe continuance of the mists during the whole winter. Rain, also, falls\r\nat rare intervals even in the driest districts, as, for instance,\r\nduring forty days, in 1726, at Chocope (7 degrees 46′); this rain\r\nentirely ruined (“Ulloa” etc. page 18) the mud houses of the\r\ninhabitants.) On the highest parts of the ledge, small fragments of the\r\nshells were mingled with, and evidently in process of reduction into, a\r\nyellowish-white, soft, calcareous powder, tasting strongly of salt, and\r\nin some places as fine as prepared medicinal chalk.\r\n\r\nFOSSIL-REMAINS OF HUMAN ART.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of these shells on San Lorenzo, I found light corallines,\r\nthe horny ovule-cases of Mollusca, roots of seaweed (Mr. Smith of\r\nJordan Hill found pieces of seaweed in an upraised pleistocene deposit\r\nin Scotland. See his admirable Paper in the “Edinburgh New\r\nPhilosophical Journal” volume 25 page 384.), bones of birds, the heads\r\nof Indian corn and other vegetable matter, a piece of woven rushes, and\r\nanother of nearly decayed COTTON string. I extracted these remains by\r\ndigging a hole, on a level spot; and they had all indisputably been\r\nembedded with the shells. I compared the plaited rush, the COTTON\r\nstring, and Indian corn, at the house of an antiquary, with similar\r\nobjects, taken from the Huacas or burial-grounds of the ancient\r\nPeruvians, and they were undistinguishable; it should be observed that\r\nthe Peruvians used string only of cotton. The small quantity of sand or\r\ngravel with the shells, the absence of large stones, the width and\r\nthickness of the bed, and the time requisite for a ledge to be cut into\r\nthe sandstone, all show that these remains were not thrown high up by\r\nan earthquake-wave: on the other hand, these facts, together with the\r\nnumber of dead shells, and of floating objects, both marine and\r\nterrestrial, both natural and human, render it almost certain that they\r\nwere accumulated on a true beach, since upraised eighty-five feet, and\r\nupraised this much since INDIAN MAN INHABITED PERU. The elevation may\r\nhave been, either by several small sudden starts, or quite gradual; in\r\nthis latter case the unrolled shells having been thrown up during gales\r\nbeyond the reach of the waves which afterwards broke on the slowly\r\nemerging land. I have made these remarks, chiefly because I was at\r\nfirst surprised at the complete difference in nature, between this\r\nbroad, smooth, upraised bed of shells, and the present shingle-beach at\r\nthe foot of the low sandstone-cliffs; but a beach formed, when the sea\r\nis cutting into the land, as is shown now to be the case by the low\r\nbare sandstone-cliffs, ought not to be compared with a beach\r\naccumulated on a gently inclined rocky surface, at a period when the\r\nsea (probably owing to the elevatory movement in process) was not able\r\nto eat into the land. With respect to the mass of nearly angular, salt-\r\ncemented fragments of sandstone, which lie under the shells, and which\r\nare so unlike the materials of an ordinary sea-beach; I think it\r\nprobable after having seen the remarkable effects of the earthquake of\r\n1835 (I have described this in my “Journal of Researches” page 303 2nd\r\nedition.), in absolutely shattering as if by gunpowder the SURFACE of\r\nthe primary rocks near Concepcion, that a smooth bare surface of stone\r\nwas left by the sea covered by the shelly mass, and that afterwards\r\nwhen upraised, it was superficially shattered by the severe shocks so\r\noften experienced here.\r\n\r\nThe very low land surrounding the town of Callao, is to the south\r\njoined by an obscure escarpment to a higher plain (south of Bella\r\nVista), which stretches along the coast for a length of about eight\r\nmiles. This plain appears to the eye quite level; but the sea-cliffs\r\nshow that its height varies (as far as I could estimate) from seventy\r\nto one hundred and twenty feet. It is composed of thin, sometimes\r\nwaving, beds of clay, often of bright red and yellow colours, of layers\r\nof impure sand, and in one part with a great stratified mass of\r\ngranitic pebbles. These beds are capped by a remarkable mass, varying\r\nfrom two to six feet in thickness, of reddish loam or mud, containing\r\nmany scattered and broken fragments of recent marine shells, sometimes\r\nthough rarely single large round pebble, more frequently short\r\nirregular layers of fine gravel, and very many pieces of red coarse\r\nearthenware, which from their curvatures must once have formed parts of\r\nlarge vessels. The earthenware is of Indian manufacture; and I found\r\nexactly similar pieces accidentally included within the bricks, of\r\nwhich the neighbouring ancient Peruvian burial-mounds are built. These\r\nfragments abounded in such numbers in certain spots, that it appeared\r\nas if waggon-loads of earthenware had been smashed to pieces. The\r\nbroken sea- shells and pottery are strewed both on the surface, and\r\nthroughout the whole thickness of this upper loamy mass. I found them\r\nwherever I examined the cliffs, for a space of between two and three\r\nmiles, and for half a mile inland; and there can be little doubt that\r\nthis same bed extends with a smooth surface several miles further over\r\nthe entire plain. Besides the little included irregular layers of small\r\npebbles, there are occasionally very obscure traces of stratification.\r\n\r\nAt one of the highest parts of the cliff, estimated 120 feet above the\r\nsea, where a little ravine came down, there were two sections, at right\r\nangles to each other, of the floor of a shed or building. In both\r\nsections or faces, two rows, one over the other, of large round stones\r\ncould be distinctly seen; they were packed close together on an\r\nartificial layer of sand two inches thick, which had been placed on the\r\nnatural clay-beds; the round stones were covered by three feet in\r\nthickness of the loam with broken sea-shells and pottery. Hence, before\r\nthis widely spread-out bed of loam was deposited, it is certain that\r\nthe plain was inhabited; and it is probable, from the broken vessels\r\nbeing so much more abundant in certain spots than in others, and from\r\nthe underlying clay being fitted for their manufacture, that the kilns\r\nstood here.\r\n\r\nThe smoothness and wide extent of the plain, the bulk of matter\r\ndeposited, and the obscure traces of stratification seem to indicate\r\nthat the loam was deposited under water; on the other hand, the\r\npresence of sea-shells, their broken state, the pebbles of various\r\nsizes, and the artificial floor of round stones, almost prove that it\r\nmust have originated in a rush of water from the sea over the land. The\r\nheight of the plain, namely, 120 feet, renders it improbable that an\r\nearthquake-wave, vast as some have here been, could have broken over\r\nthe surface at its present level; but when the land stood eighty-five\r\nfeet lower, at the period when the shells were thrown up on the ledge\r\nat S. Lorenzo, and when as we know man inhabited this district, such an\r\nevent might well have occurred; and if we may further suppose, that the\r\nplain was at that time converted into a temporary lake, as actually\r\noccurred, during the earthquakes of 1713 and 1746, in the case of the\r\nlow land round Callao owing to its being encircled by a high\r\nshingle-beach, all the appearances above described will be perfectly\r\nexplained. I must add, that at a lower level near the point where the\r\npresent low land round Callao joins the higher plain, there are\r\nappearances of two distinct deposits both apparently formed by\r\ndebacles: in the upper one, a horse’s tooth and a dog’s jaw were\r\nembedded; so that both must have been formed after the settlement of\r\nthe Spaniards: according to Acosta, the earthquake-wave of 1586 rose\r\neighty-four feet.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of Callao do not believe, as far as I could ascertain,\r\nthat any change in level is now in progress. The great fragments of\r\nbrickwork, which it is asserted can be seen at the bottom of the sea,\r\nand which have been adduced as a proof of a late subsidence, are, as I\r\nam informed by Mr. Gill, a resident engineer, loose fragments; this is\r\nprobable, for I found on the beach, and not near the remains of any\r\nbuilding, masses of brickwork, three and four feet square, which had\r\nbeen washed into their present places, and smoothed over with shingle\r\nduring the earthquake of 1746. The spit of land, on which the ruins of\r\nOLD Callao stand, is so extremely low and narrow, that it is improbable\r\nin the highest degree that a town should have been founded on it in its\r\npresent state; and I have lately heard that M. Tschudi has come to the\r\nconclusion, from a comparison of old with modern charts, that the coast\r\nboth south and north of Callao has subsided. (I am indebted for this\r\nfact to Dr. E. Dieffenbach. I may add that there is a tradition, that\r\nthe islands of San Lorenzo and Fronton were once joined, and that the\r\nchannel between San Lorenzo and the mainland, now above two miles in\r\nwidth, was so narrow that cattle used to swim over.) I have shown that\r\nthe island of San Lorenzo has been upraised eighty-five feet since the\r\nPeruvians inhabited this country; and whatever may have been the amount\r\nof recent subsidence, by so much more must the elevation have exceeded\r\nthe eighty-five feet. In several places in this neighbourhood, marks of\r\nsea-action have been observed: Ulloa gives a detailed account of such\r\nappearances at a point five leagues northward of Callao: Mr. Cruikshank\r\nfound near Lima successive lines of sea-cliffs, with rounded blocks at\r\ntheir bases, at a height of 700 feet above the present level of the\r\nsea. (“Observaciones sobre el Clima del Lima” par Dr. H. Unanue page\r\n4.—Ulloa’s “Voyage” volume 2 English Translation page 97.—For Mr.\r\nCruikshank’s observations, see Mr. Lyell’s “Principles of Geology” 1st\r\nedition volume 3 page 130.) ON THE DECAY OF UPRAISED SEA-SHELLS.\r\n\r\nI have stated that many of the shells on the lower inclined ledge or\r\nterrace of San Lorenzo are corroded in a peculiar manner, and that they\r\nhave a much more ancient appearance than the same species at\r\nconsiderably greater heights on the coast of Chile. I have, also,\r\nstated that these shells in the upper part of the ledge, at the height\r\nof eighty-five feet above the sea, are falling, and in some parts are\r\nquite changed into a fine, soft, saline, calcareous powder. The finest\r\npart of this powder has been analysed for me, at the request of Sir H.\r\nDe la Beche, by the kindness of Mr. Trenham Reeks of the Museum of\r\nEconomic Geology; it consists of carbonate of lime in abundance, of\r\nsulphate and muriate of lime, and of muriate and sulphate of soda. The\r\ncarbonate of lime is obviously derived from the shells; and common salt\r\nis so abundant in parts of the bed, that, as before remarked, the\r\nunivalves are often filled with it. The sulphate of lime may have been\r\nderived, as has probably the common salt, from the evaporation of the\r\nsea-spray, during the emergence of the land; for sulphate of lime is\r\nnow copiously deposited from the spray on the shores of Ascension. (See\r\n“Volcanic Islands” etc. by the Author.) The other saline bodies may\r\nperhaps have been partially thus derived, but chiefly, as I conclude\r\nfrom the following facts, through a different means.\r\n\r\nOn most parts of the second ledge or old sea-beach, at a height of 170\r\nfeet, there is a layer of white powder of variable thickness, as much\r\nin some parts as two inches, lying on the angular, salt-cemented\r\nfragments of sandstone and under about four inches of earth, which\r\npowder, from its close resemblance in nature to the upper and most\r\ndecayed parts of the shelly mass, I can hardly doubt originally existed\r\nas a bed of shells, now much collapsed and quite disintegrated. I could\r\nnot discover with the microscope a trace of organic structure in it;\r\nbut its chemical constituents, according to Mr. Reeks, are the same as\r\nin the powder extracted from amongst the decaying shells on the lower\r\nledge, with the marked exception that the carbonate of lime is present\r\nin only very small quantity. On the third and highest ledge, I observed\r\nsome of this powder in a similar position, and likewise occasionally in\r\nsmall patches at considerably greater heights near the summit of the\r\nisland. At Iquique, where the whole face of the country is covered by a\r\nhighly saliferous alluvium, and where the climate is extremely dry, we\r\nhave seen that, according to Mr. Blake, the shells which are perfect\r\nnear the beach become, in ascending, gradually less and less perfect,\r\nuntil scarcely a trace of their original structure can be discovered.\r\nIt is known that carbonate of lime and common salt left in a mass\r\ntogether, and slightly moistened, partially decompose each other (I am\r\ninformed by Dr. Kane, through Mr. Reeks, that a manufactory was\r\nestablished on this principle in France, but failed from the small\r\nquantity of carbonate of soda produced. Sprengel “Gardeners’ Chronicle”\r\n1845 page 157, states, that salt and carbonate of lime are liable to\r\nmutual decomposition in the soil. Sir H. De la Beche informs me, that\r\ncalcareous rocks washed by the spray of the sea, are often corroded in\r\na peculiar manner; see also on this latter subject “Gardeners’\r\nChronicle” page 675 1844.): now we have at San Lorenzo and at Iquique,\r\nin the shells and salt packed together, and occasionally moistened by\r\nthe so- called Peruvian dew, the proper elements for this action. We\r\ncan thus understand the peculiar corroded appearance of the shells on\r\nSan Lorenzo, and the great decrease of quantity in the carbonate of\r\nlime in the powder on the upper ledge. There is, however, a great\r\ndifficulty on this view, for the resultant salts should be carbonate of\r\nsoda and muriate of lime; the latter is present, but not the carbonate\r\nof soda. Hence I am led to the perhaps unauthorised conjecture (which I\r\nshall hereafter have to refer to) that the carbonate of soda, by some\r\nunexplained means, becomes converted into a sulphate.\r\n\r\nIf the above remarks be just, we are led to the very unexpected\r\nconclusion, that a dry climate, by leaving the salt from the sea-spray\r\nundissolved, is much less favourable to the preservation of upraised\r\nshells than a humid climate. However this may be, it is interesting to\r\nknow the manner in which masses of shells, gradually upraised above the\r\nsea-level, decay and finally disappear.\r\n\r\nA SUMMARY ON THE RECENT ELEVATION OF THE WEST COAST OF SOUTH AMERICA.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that upraised marine remains occur at intervals, and in\r\nsome parts almost continuously, from latitude 45 degrees 35′ to 12\r\ndegrees S., along the shores of the Pacific. This is a distance, in a\r\nnorth and south line, of 2,075 geographical miles. From Byron’s\r\nobservations, the elevation has no doubt extended sixty miles further\r\nsouth; and from the similarity in the form of the country near Lima, it\r\nhas probably extended many leagues further north. (I may take this\r\nopportunity of stating that in a MS. in the Geological Society by Mr.\r\nWeaver, it is stated that beds of oysters and other recent shells are\r\nfound thirty feet above the level of the sea, in many parts of Tampico,\r\nin the Gulf of Mexico.) Along this great line of coast, besides the\r\norganic remains, there are in very many parts, marks of erosion, caves,\r\nancient beaches, sand-dunes, and successive terraces of gravel, all\r\nabove the present level of the sea. From the steepness of the land on\r\nthis side of the continent, shells have rarely been found at greater\r\ndistances inland than from two to three leagues; but the marks of\r\nsea-action are evident farther from the coast; for instance, in the\r\nvalley of Guasco, at a distance of between thirty and forty miles.\r\nJudging from the upraised shells alone, the elevation in Chiloe has\r\nbeen 350 feet, at Concepcion certainly 625 feet; and by estimation\r\n1,000 feet; at Valparaiso 1,300 feet; at Coquimbo 252 feet; northward\r\nof this place, sea-shells have not, I believe, been found above 300\r\nfeet; and at Lima they were falling into decay (hastened probably by\r\nthe salt) at 85 feet. Not only has this amount of elevation taken place\r\nwithin the period of existing Mollusca and Cirripedes; but their\r\nproportional numbers in the neighbouring sea have in most cases\r\nremained the same. Near Lima, however, a small change in this respect\r\nbetween the living and the upraised was observed: at Coquimbo this was\r\nmore evident, all the shells being existing species, but with those\r\nembedded in the uppermost calcareous plain not approximating so closely\r\nin proportional numbers, as do those that lie loose on its surface at\r\nthe height of 252 feet, and still less closely than those which are\r\nstrewed on the lower plains, which latter are identical in proportional\r\nnumbers with those now cast up on the beach. From this circumstance,\r\nand from not finding, upon careful examination, near Coquimbo any\r\nshells at a greater height than 252 feet, I believe that the recent\r\nelevation there has been much less than at Valparaiso, where it has\r\nbeen 1,300 feet, and I may add, than at Concepcion. This considerable\r\ninequality in the amount of elevation at Coquimbo and Valparaiso,\r\nplaces only 200 miles apart, is not improbable, considering, first, the\r\ndifference in the force and number of the shocks now yearly affecting\r\ndifferent parts of this coast; and, secondly, the fact of single areas,\r\nsuch as that of the province of Concepcion, having been uplifted very\r\nunequally during the same earthquake. It would, in most cases, be very\r\nhazardous to infer an inequality of elevation, from shells being found\r\non the surface or in superficial beds at different heights; for we do\r\nnot know on what their rate of decay depends; and at Coquimbo one\r\ninstance out of many has been given, of a promontory, which, from the\r\noccurrence of one very small collection of lime-cemented shells, has\r\nindisputably been elevated 242 feet, and yet on which, not even a\r\nfragment of shell could be found on careful examination between this\r\nheight and the beach, although many sites appeared very favourable for\r\nthe preservation of organic remains: the absence, also, of shells on\r\nthe gravel-terraces a short distance up the valley of Coquimbo, though\r\nabundant on the corresponding terraces at its mouth, should be borne in\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nThere are other epochs, besides that of the existence of recent\r\nMollusca, by which to judge of the changes of level on this coast. At\r\nLima, as we have just seen, the elevation has been at least eighty-five\r\nfeet, within the Indo-human period; and since the arrival of the\r\nSpaniards in 1530, there has apparently been a sinking of the surface.\r\nAt Valparaiso, in the course of 220 years, the rise must have been less\r\nthan nineteen feet; but it has been as much as from ten to eleven feet\r\nin the seventeen years subsequently to 1817, and of this rise only a\r\npart can be attributed to the earthquake of 1822, the remainder having\r\nbeen insensible and apparently still, in 1834, in progress. At Chiloe\r\nthe elevation has been gradual, and about four feet during four years.\r\nAt Coquimbo, also, it has been gradual, and in the course of 150 years\r\nhas amounted to several feet. The sudden small upheavals, accompanied\r\nby earthquakes, as in 1822 at Valparaiso, in 1835 at Concepcion, and in\r\n1837 in the Chonos Archipelago, are familiar to most geologists, but\r\nthe gradual rising of the coast of Chile has been hardly noticed; it\r\nis, however, very important, as connecting together these two orders of\r\nevents.\r\n\r\nThe rise of Lima, having been eighty-five feet within the period of\r\nman, is the more surprising if we refer to the eastern coast of the\r\ncontinent, for at Port S. Julian, in Patagonia, there is good evidence\r\n(as we shall hereafter see) that when the land stood ninety feet lower,\r\nthe Macrauchenia, a mammiferous beast, was alive; and at Bahia Blanca,\r\nwhen it stood only a few feet lower than it now does, many gigantic\r\nquadrupeds ranged over the adjoining country. But the coast of\r\nPatagonia is some way distant from the Cordillera, and the movement at\r\nBahia Blanca is perhaps noways connected with this great range, but\r\nrather with the tertiary volcanic rocks of Banda Oriental, and\r\ntherefore the elevation at these places may have been infinitely slower\r\nthan on the coast of Peru. All such speculations, however, must be\r\nvague, for as we know with certainty that the elevation of the whole\r\ncoast of Patagonia has been interrupted by many and long pauses, who\r\nwill pretend to say that, in such cases, many and long periods of\r\nsubsidence may not also have been intercalated?\r\n\r\nIn many parts of the coast of Chile and Peru there are marks of the\r\naction of the sea at successive heights on the land, showing that the\r\nelevation has been interrupted by periods of comparative rest in the\r\nupward movement, and of denudation in the action of the sea. These are\r\nplainest at Chiloe, where, in a height of about five hundred feet,\r\nthere are three escarpments,—at Coquimbo, where in a height of 364\r\nfeet, there are five,— at Guasco, where there are six, of which five\r\nmay perhaps correspond with those at Coquimbo, but if so, the\r\nsubsequent and intervening elevatory movements have been here much more\r\nenergetic,—at Lima, where, in a height of about 250 feet there are\r\nthree terraces, and others, as it is asserted, at considerably greater\r\nheights. The almost entire absence of ancient marks of sea-action at\r\ndefined levels along considerable spaces of coast, as near Valparaiso\r\nand Concepcion, is highly instructive, for as it is improbable that the\r\nelevation at these places alone should have been continuous, we must\r\nattribute the absence of such marks to the nature and form of the\r\ncoast-rocks. Seeing over how many hundred miles of the coast of\r\nPatagonia, and on how many places on the shores of the Pacific, the\r\nelevatory process has been interrupted by periods of comparative rest,\r\nwe may conclude, conjointly with the evidence drawn from other quarters\r\nof the world, that the elevation of the land is generally an\r\nintermittent action. From the quantity of matter removed in the\r\nformation of the escarpments, especially of those of Patagonia, it\r\nappears that the periods of rest in the movement, and of denudation of\r\nthe land, have generally been very long. In Patagonia, we have seen\r\nthat the elevation has been equable, and the periods of denudation\r\nsynchronous over very wide spaces of coast; on the shores of the\r\nPacific, owing to the terraces chiefly occurring in the valleys, we\r\nhave not equal means of judging on this point; and the very different\r\nheights of the upraised shells at Coquimbo, Valparaiso, and Concepcion\r\nseem directly opposed to such a conclusion.\r\n\r\nWhether on this side of the continent the elevation, between the\r\nperiods of comparative rest when the escarpments were formed, has been\r\nby small sudden starts, such as those accompanying recent earthquakes,\r\nor, as is most probable, by such starts conjointly with a gradual\r\nupward movement, or by great and sudden upheavals, I have no direct\r\nevidence. But as on the eastern coast, I was led to think, from the\r\nanalogy of the last hundred feet of elevation in La Plata, and from the\r\nnearly equal size of the pebbles over the entire width of the terraces,\r\nand from the upraised shells being all littoral species, that the\r\nelevation had been gradual; so do I on this western coast, from the\r\nanalogy of the movements now in progress, and from the vast numbers of\r\nshells now living exclusively on or close to the beach, which are\r\nstrewed over the whole surface of the land up to very considerable\r\nheights, conclude, that the movement here also has been slow and\r\ngradual, aided probably by small occasional starts. We know at least\r\nthat at Coquimbo, where five escarpments occur in a height of 364 feet,\r\nthe successive elevations, if they have been sudden, cannot have been\r\nvery great. It has, I think, been shown that the occasional\r\npreservation of shells, unrolled and unbroken, is not improbable even\r\nduring a quite gradual rising of the land; and their preservation, if\r\nthe movement has been aided by small starts, is quite conformable with\r\nwhat actually takes place during recent earthquakes.\r\n\r\nJudging from the present action of the sea, along the shores of the\r\nPacific, on the deposits of its own accumulation, the present time\r\nseems in most places to be one of comparative rest in the elevatory\r\nmovement, and of denudation of the land. Undoubtedly this is the case\r\nalong the whole great length of Patagonia. At Chiloe, however, we have\r\nseen that a narrow sloping fringe, covered with vegetation, separates\r\nthe present sea-beach from a line of low cliffs, which the waves lately\r\nreached; here, then, the land is gaining in breadth and height, and the\r\npresent period is not one of rest in the elevation and of contingent\r\ndenudation; but if the rising be not prolonged at a quick rate, there\r\nis every probability that the sea will soon regain its former\r\nhorizontal limits. I observed similar low sloping fringes on several\r\nparts of the coast, both northward of Valparaiso and near Coquimbo; but\r\nat this latter place, from the change in form which the coast has\r\nundergone since the old escarpments were worn, it may be doubted\r\nwhether the sea, acting for any length of time at its present level,\r\nwould eat into the land; for it now rather tends to throw up great\r\nmasses of sand. It is from facts such as these that I have generally\r\nused the term COMPARATIVE rest, as applied to the elevation of the\r\nland; the rest or cessation in the movement being comparative both with\r\nwhat has preceded it and followed it, and with the sea’s power of\r\ncorrosion at each spot and at each level. Near Lima, the cliff-formed\r\nshores of San Lorenzo, and on the mainland south of Callao, show that\r\nthe sea is gaining on the land; and as we have here some evidence that\r\nits surface has lately subsided or is still sinking, the periods of\r\ncomparative rest in the elevation and of contingent denudation, may\r\nprobably in many cases include periods of subsidence. It is only, as\r\nwas shown in detail when discussing the terraces of Coquimbo, when the\r\nsea with difficulty and after a long lapse of time has either corroded\r\na narrow ledge into solid rock, or has heaped up on a steep surface a\r\nNARROW mound of detritus, that we can confidently assert that the land\r\nat that level and at that period long remained absolutely stationary.\r\nIn the case of terraces formed of gravel or sand, although the\r\nelevation may have been strictly horizontal, it may well happen that no\r\none level beach-line may be traceable, and that neither the terraces\r\nthemselves nor the summit nor basal edges of their escarpments may be\r\nhorizontal.\r\n\r\nFinally, comparing the extent of the elevated area, as deduced from the\r\nupraised recent organic remains, on the two sides of the continent, we\r\nhave seen that on the Atlantic, shells have been found at intervals\r\nfrom Eastern Tierra del Fuego for 1,180 miles northward, and on the\r\nPacific for a space of 2,075 miles. For a length of 775 miles, they\r\noccur in the same latitudes on both sides of the continent. Without\r\ntaking this circumstance into consideration, it is probable from the\r\nreasons assigned in the last chapter, that the entire breadth of the\r\ncontinent in Central Patagonia has been uplifted in mass; but from\r\nother reasons there given, it would be hazardous to extend this\r\nconclusion to La Plata. From the continent being narrow in the\r\nsouthern-most parts of Patagonia, and from the shells found at the\r\nInner Narrows of the Strait of Magellan, and likewise far up the valley\r\nof the Santa Cruz, it is probable that the southern part of the western\r\ncoast, which was not visited by me, has been elevated within the period\r\nof recent Mollusca: if so, the shores of the Pacific have been\r\ncontinuously, recently, and in a geological sense synchronously\r\nupraised, from Lima for a length of 2,480 nautical miles southward,—a\r\ndistance equal to that from the Red Sea to the North Cape of\r\nScandinavia!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\nON THE PLAINS AND VALLEYS OF CHILE:—SALIFEROUS SUPERFICIAL DEPOSITS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBasin-like plains of Chile; their drainage, their marine origin.—Marks\r\nof sea-action on the eastern flanks of the Cordillera.—Sloping\r\nterrace-like fringes of stratified shingle within the valleys of the\r\nCordillera; their marine origin.—Boulders in the valley of\r\nCachapual.—Horizontal elevation of the Cordillera.—Formation of\r\nvalleys.—Boulders moved by earthquake-waves.—Saline superficial\r\ndeposits.—Bed of nitrate of soda at Iquique.—Saline\r\nincrustations.—Salt-lakes of La Plata and Patagonia; purity of the\r\nsalt; its origin.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe space between the Cordillera and the coast of Chile is on a rude\r\naverage from eighty to above one hundred miles in width; it is formed,\r\neither of an almost continuous mass of mountains, or more commonly of\r\nseveral nearly parallel ranges, separated by plains; in the more\r\nsouthern parts of this province the mountains are quite subordinate to\r\nthe plains; in the northern part the mountains predominate.\r\n\r\nThe basin-like plains at the foot of the Cordillera are in several\r\nrespects remarkable; that on which the capital of Chile stands is\r\nfifteen miles in width, in an east and west line, and of much greater\r\nlength in a north and south line; it stands 1,750 feet above the sea;\r\nits surface appears smooth, but really falls and rises in wide gentle\r\nundulations, the hollows corresponding with the main valleys of the\r\nCordillera: the striking manner in which it abruptly comes up to the\r\nfoot of this great range has been remarked by every author since the\r\ntime of Molina. (This plain is partially separated into two basins by a\r\nrange of hills; the southern half, according to Meyen (“Reise um Erde”\r\nTh. 1 s. 274), falls in height, by an abrupt step, of between fifteen\r\nand twenty feet.) Near the Cordillera it is composed of a stratified\r\nmass of pebbles of all sizes, occasionally including rounded boulders:\r\nnear its western boundary, it consists of reddish sandy clay,\r\ncontaining some pebbles and numerous fragments of pumice, and sometimes\r\npasses into pure sand or into volcanic ashes. At Podaguel, on this\r\nwestern side of the plain, beds of sand are capped by a calcareous\r\ntuff, the uppermost layers being generally hard and substalagmitic, and\r\nthe lower ones white and friable, both together precisely resembling\r\nthe beds at Coquimbo, which contain recent marine shells. Abrupt, but\r\nrounded, hummocks of rock rise out of this plain: those of Sta. Lucia\r\nand S. Cristoval are formed of greenstone-porphyry almost entirely\r\ndenuded of its original covering of porphyritic claystone breccia; on\r\ntheir summits, many fragments of rock (some of them kinds not found in\r\nsitu) are coated and united together by a white, friable, calcareous\r\ntuff, like that found at Podaguel. When this matter was deposited on\r\nthe summit of S. Cristoval, the water must have stood 946 feet above\r\nthe surface of the surrounding plain. (Or 2,690 feet above the sea, as\r\nmeasured barometrically by Mr. Eck. This tuff appears to the eye nearly\r\npure; but when placed in acid it leaves a considerable residue of sand\r\nand broken crystals, apparently of feldspar. Dr. Meyen (“Reise” Th. 1\r\ns. 269) says he found a similar substance on the neighbouring hill of\r\nDominico (and I found it also on the Cerro Blanco), and he attributes\r\nit to the weathering of the stone. In some places which I examined, its\r\nbulk put this view of its origin quite out of the question; and I\r\nshould much doubt whether the decomposition of a porphyry would, in any\r\ncase, leave a crust chiefly composed of carbonate of lime. The white\r\ncrust, which is commonly seen on weathered feldspathic rocks, does not\r\nappear to contain any free carbonate of lime.)\r\n\r\nTo the south this basin-like plain contracts, and rising scarcely\r\nperceptibly with a smooth surface, passes through a remarkable level\r\ngap in the mountains, forming a true land-strait, and called the\r\nAngostura. It then immediately expands into a second basin-formed\r\nplain: this again to the south contracts into another land-strait, and\r\nexpands into a third basin, which, however, falls suddenly in level\r\nabout forty feet. This third basin, to the south, likewise contracts\r\ninto a strait, and then again opens into the great plain of San\r\nFernando, stretching so far south that the snowy peaks of the distant\r\nCordillera are seen rising above its horizon as above the sea. These\r\nplains, near the Cordillera, are generally formed of a thick stratified\r\nmass of shingle (The plain of San Fernando has, according to MM. Meyen\r\nand Gay “Reise” etc. Th. 1 ss. 295 and 298, near the Cordillera, an\r\nupper step-formed plain of clay, on the surface of which they found\r\nnumerous blocks of rocks, from two to three feet long, either lying\r\nsingle or piled in heaps, but all arranged in nearly straight lines.);\r\nin other parts, of a red sandy clay, often with an admixture of\r\npumiceous matter. Although these basins are connected together like a\r\nnecklace, in a north and south line, by smooth land-straits, the\r\nstreams which drain them do not all flow north and south, but mostly\r\nwestward, through breaches worn in the bounding mountains; and in the\r\ncase of the second basin, or that of Rancagua, there are two distinct\r\nbreaches. Each basin, moreover, is not drained singly; thus, to give\r\nthe most striking instance, but not the only one, in proceeding\r\nsouthward over the plain of Rancagua, we first find the water flowing\r\nnorthward to and through the northern land-strait; then, without\r\ncrossing any marked ridge or watershed, we see it flowing\r\nsouth-westward towards the northern one of the two breaches in the\r\nwestern mountainous boundary; and lastly, again without any ridge, it\r\nflows towards the southern breach in these same mountains. Hence the\r\nsurface of this one basin-like plain, appearing to the eye so level,\r\nhas been modelled with great nicety, so that the drainage, without any\r\nconspicuous watersheds, is directed towards three openings in the\r\nencircling mountains. ((It appears from Captain Herbert’s account of\r\nthe Diluvium of the Himalaya, “Gleanings of Science” Calcutta volume 2\r\npage 164, that precisely similar remarks apply to the drainage of the\r\nplains or valleys between those great mountains.) The streams flowing\r\nfrom the southern basin-like plains, after passing through the breaches\r\nto the west, unite and form the river Rapel, which enters the Pacific\r\nnear Navidad. I followed the southernmost branch of this river, and\r\nfound that the basin or plain of San Fernando is continuously and\r\nsmoothly united with those plains, which were described in the Second\r\nChapter, as being worn near the coast into successive cave-eaten\r\nescarpments, and still nearer to the coast, as being strewed with\r\nupraised recent marine remains.\r\n\r\nI might have given descriptions of numerous other plains of the same\r\ngeneral form, some at the foot of the Cordillera, some near the coast,\r\nand some halfway between these points. I will allude only to one other,\r\nnamely, the plain of Uspallata, lying on the eastern or opposite side\r\nof the Cordillera, between that great range and the parallel lower\r\nrange of Uspallata. According to Miers, its surface is 6,000 feet above\r\nthe level of the sea: it is from ten to fifteen miles in width, and is\r\nsaid to extend with an unbroken surface for 180 miles northwards: it is\r\ndrained by two rivers passing through breaches in the mountains to the\r\neast. On the banks of the River Mendoza it is seen to be composed of a\r\ngreat accumulation of stratified shingle, estimated at 400 feet in\r\nthickness. In general appearance, and in numerous points of structure,\r\nthis plain closely resembles those of Chile.\r\n\r\nThe origin and manner of formation of the thick beds of gravel, sandy\r\nclay, volcanic detritus, and calcareous tuff, composing these\r\nbasin-like plains, is very important; because, as we shall presently\r\nshow, they send arms or fringes far up the main valleys of the\r\nCordillera. Many of the inhabitants believe that these plains were once\r\noccupied by lakes, suddenly drained; but I conceive that the number of\r\nthe separate breaches at nearly the same level in the mountains\r\nsurrounding them quite precludes this idea. Had not such distinguished\r\nnaturalists as MM. Meyen and Gay stated their belief that these\r\ndeposits were left by great debacles rushing down from the Cordillera,\r\nI should not have noticed a view, which appears to me from many reasons\r\nimprobable in the highest degree—namely, from the vast accumulation of\r\nWELL-ROUNDED PEBBLES—their frequent stratification with layers of\r\nsand—the overlying beds of calcareous tuff—this same substance coating\r\nand uniting the fragments of rock on the hummocks in the plain of\r\nSantiago—and lastly even from the worn, rounded, and much denuded state\r\nof these hummocks, and of the headlands which project from the\r\nsurrounding mountains. On the other hand, these several circumstances,\r\nas well as the continuous union of the basins at the foot of the\r\nCordillera, with the great plain of the Rio Rapel which still retains\r\nthe marks of sea-action at various levels, and their general similarity\r\nin form and composition with the many plains near the coast, which are\r\neither similarly marked or are strewed with upraised marine remains,\r\nfully convince me that the mountains bounding these basin-plains were\r\nbreached, their islet-like projecting rocks worn, and the loose\r\nstratified detritus forming their now level surfaces deposited, by the\r\nsea, as the land slowly emerged. It is hardly possible to state too\r\nstrongly the perfect resemblance in outline between these basin-like,\r\nlong, and narrow plains of Chile (especially when in the early morning\r\nthe mists hanging low represented water), and the creeks and fiords now\r\nintersecting the southern and western shores of the continent. We can\r\non this view of the sea, when the land stood lower, having long and\r\ntranquilly occupied the spaces between the mountain-ranges, understand\r\nhow the boundaries of the separate basins were breached in more than\r\none place; for we see that this is the general character of the inland\r\nbays and channels of Tierra del Fuego; we there, also, see in the\r\nsawing action of the tides, which flow with great force in the cross\r\nchannels, a power sufficient to keep the breaches open as the land\r\nemerged. We can further see that the waves would naturally leave the\r\nsmooth bottom of each great bay or channel, as it became slowly\r\nconverted into land, gently inclined to as many points as there were\r\nmouths, through which the sea finally retreated, thus forming so many\r\nwatersheds, without any marked ridges, on a nearly level surface. The\r\nabsence of marine remains in these high inland plains cannot be\r\nproperly adduced as an objection to their marine origin: for we may\r\nconclude, from shells not being found in the great shingle beds of\r\nPatagonia, though copiously strewed on their surfaces, and from many\r\nother analogous facts, that such deposits are eminently unfavourable\r\nfor the embedment of such remains; and with respect to shells not being\r\nfound strewed on the surface of these basin-like plains, it was shown\r\nin the last chapter that remains thus exposed in time decay and\r\ndisappear.\r\n\r\n(FIGURE 13. SECTION OF THE PLAIN AT THE EASTERN FOOT OF THE CHILEAN\r\nCORDILLERA.\r\n\r\nFrom Cordillera (left) through Talus-plain and Level surface, 2,700\r\nfeet above sea, to Gravel terraces (right).)\r\n\r\nI observed some appearances on the plains at the eastern and opposite\r\nfoot of the Cordillera which are worth notice, as showing that the sea\r\nthere long acted at nearly the same level as on the basin-plains of\r\nChile. The mountains on this eastern side are exceedingly abrupt; they\r\nrise out of a smooth, talus-like, very gentle, slope, from five to ten\r\nmiles in width (as represented in Figure 13), entirely composed of\r\nperfectly rounded pebbles, often white-washed with an aluminous\r\nsubstance like decomposed feldspar. This sloping plain or talus blends\r\ninto a perfectly flat space a few miles in width, composed of reddish\r\nimpure clay, with small calcareous concretions as in the Pampean\r\ndeposit,—of fine white sand with small pebbles in layers,—and of the\r\nabove-mentioned white aluminous earth, all interstratified together.\r\nThis flat space runs as far as Mendoza, thirty miles northward, and\r\nstands probably at about the same height, namely, 2,700 feet (Pentland\r\nand Miers) above the sea. To the east it is bounded by an escarpment,\r\neighty feet in height, running for many miles north and south, and\r\ncomposed of perfectly round pebbles, and loose, white-washed, or\r\nembedded in the aluminous earth: behind this escarpment there is a\r\nsecond and similar one of gravel. Northward of Mendoza, these\r\nescarpments become broken and quite obliterated; and it does not appear\r\nthat they ever enclosed a lake-like area: I conclude, therefore, that\r\nthey were formed by the sea, when it reached the foot of the\r\nCordillera, like the similar escarpments occurring at so many points on\r\nthe coasts of Chile and Patagonia.\r\n\r\nThe talus-like plain slopes up with a smooth surface into the great dry\r\nvalleys of the Cordillera. On each hand of the Portillo valley, the\r\nmountains are formed of red granite, mica-slate, and basalt, which all\r\nhave suffered a truly astonishing amount of denudation; the gravel in\r\nthe valley, as well as on the talus-like plain in front of it, is\r\ncomposed of these rocks; but at the mouth of the valley, in the middle\r\n(height probably about three thousand five hundred feet above the sea),\r\na few small isolated hillocks of several varieties of porphyry project,\r\nround which, on all sides, smooth and often white-washed pebbles of\r\nthese same porphyries, to the exclusion of all others, extend to a\r\ncircumscribed distance. Now, it is difficult to conceive any other\r\nagency, except the quiet and long-continued action of the sea on these\r\nhillocks, which could have rounded and whitewashed the fragments of\r\nporphyry, and caused them to radiate from such small and quite\r\ninsignificant centres, in the midst of that vast stream of stones which\r\nhas descended from the main Cordillera.\r\n\r\nSLOPING TERRACES OF GRAVEL IN THE VALLEYS OF THE CORDILLERA.\r\n\r\n(FIGURE 14. GROUND-PLAN OF A BIFURCATING VALLEY IN THE CORDILLERA,\r\nbordered by smooth, sloping gravel-fringes (AA), worn along the course\r\nof the river into cliffs.)\r\n\r\nAll the main valleys on both flanks of the Chilean Cordillera have\r\nformerly had, or still have, their bottoms filled up to a considerable\r\nthickness by a mass of rudely stratified shingle. In Central Chile the\r\ngreater part of this mass has been removed by the torrents;\r\ncliff-bounded fringes, more or less continuous, being left at\r\ncorresponding heights on both sides of the valleys. These fringes, or\r\nas they may be called terraces, have a smooth surface, and as the\r\nvalleys rise, they gently rise with them: hence they are easily\r\nirrigated, and afford great facilities for the construction of the\r\nroads. From their uniformity, they give a remarkable character to the\r\nscenery of these grand, wild, broken valleys. In width, the fringes\r\nvary much, sometimes being only broad enough for the roads, and\r\nsometimes expanding into narrow plains. Their surfaces, besides gently\r\nrising up the valley, are slightly inclined towards its centre in such\r\na manner as to show that the whole bottom must once have been filled up\r\nwith a smooth and slightly concave mass, as still are the dry\r\nunfurrowed valleys of Northern Chile. Where two valleys unite into one,\r\nthese terraces are particularly well exhibited, as is represented in\r\nFigure 14. The thickness of the gravel forming these fringes, on a rude\r\naverage, may be said to vary from thirty to sixty or eighty feet; but\r\nnear the mouths of the valleys it was in several places from two to\r\nthree hundred feet. The amount of matter removed by the torrents has\r\nbeen immense; yet in the lower parts of the valleys the terraces have\r\nseldom been entirely worn away on either side, nor has the solid\r\nunderlying rock been reached: higher up the valleys, the terraces have\r\nfrequently been removed on one or the other side, and sometimes on both\r\nsides; but in this latter case they reappear after a short interval on\r\nthe line, which they would have held had they been unbroken. Where the\r\nsolid rock has been reached, it has been cut into deep and narrow\r\ngorges. Still higher up the valleys, the terraces gradually become more\r\nand more broken, narrower, and less thick, until, at a height of from\r\nseven to nine thousand feet, they become lost, and blended with the\r\npiles of fallen detritus.\r\n\r\nI carefully examined in many places the state of the gravel, and almost\r\neverywhere found the pebbles equally and perfectly rounded,\r\noccasionally with great blocks of rock, and generally distinctly\r\nstratified, often with parting seams of sand. The pebbles were\r\nsometimes coated with a white aluminous, and less frequently with a\r\ncalcareous, crust. At great heights up the valleys the pebbles become\r\nless rounded; and as the terraces become obliterated, the whole mass\r\npasses into the nature of ordinary detritus. I was repeatedly struck\r\nwith the great difference between this detritus high up the valleys,\r\nand the gravel of the terraces low down, namely, in the greater number\r\nof the quite angular fragments in the detritus,—in the unequal degree\r\nto which the other fragments have been rounded,—in the quantity of\r\nassociated earth,—in the absence of stratification,—and in the\r\nirregularity of the upper surfaces. This difference was likewise well\r\nshown at points low down the valleys, where precipitous ravines,\r\ncutting through mountains of highly coloured rock, have thrown down\r\nwide, fan- shaped accumulations of detritus on the terraces: in such\r\ncases, the line of separation between the detritus and the terrace\r\ncould be pointed out to within an inch or two; the detritus consisting\r\nentirely of angular and only partially rounded fragments of the\r\nadjoining coloured rocks; the stratified shingle (as I ascertained by\r\nclose inspection, especially in one case, in the valley of the River\r\nMendoza) containing only a small proportion of these fragments, and\r\nthose few well rounded.\r\n\r\nI particularly attended to the appearance of the terraces where the\r\nvalleys made abrupt and considerable bends, but I could perceive no\r\ndifference in their structure: they followed the bends with their usual\r\nnearly equable inclination. I observed, also, in several valleys, that\r\nwherever large blocks of any rock became numerous, either on the\r\nsurface of the terrace or embedded in it, this rock soon appeared\r\nhigher up in situ: thus I have noticed blocks of porphyry, of andesitic\r\nsyenite, of porphyry and of syenite, alternately becoming numerous, and\r\nin each case succeeded by mountains thus constituted. There is,\r\nhowever, one remarkable exception to this rule; for along the valley of\r\nthe Cachapual, M. Gay found numerous large blocks of white granite,\r\nwhich does not occur in the neighbourhood. I observed these blocks, as\r\nwell as others of andesitic syenite (not occurring here in situ), near\r\nthe baths of Cauquenes at a height of between two and three hundred\r\nfeet above the river, and therefore quite above the terrace or fringe\r\nwhich borders that river; some miles up the valleys there were other\r\nblocks at about the same height. I also noticed, at a less height, just\r\nabove the terrace, blocks of porphyries (apparently not found in the\r\nimmediately impending mountains), arranged in rude lines, as on a\r\nsea-beach. All these blocks were rounded, and though large, not\r\ngigantic, like the true erratic boulders of Patagonia and Fuegia. M.\r\nGay states that the granite does not occur in situ within a distance of\r\ntwenty leagues (“Annales des Science Nat. “ 1 series tome 28. M. Gay,\r\nas I was informed, penetrated the Cordillera by the great oblique\r\nvalley of Los Cupressos, and not by the most direct line.); I suspect,\r\nfor several reasons, that it will ultimately be found at a much less\r\ndistance, though certainly not in the immediate neighbourhood. The\r\nboulders found by MM. Meyen and Gay on the upper plain of San Fernando\r\n(mentioned in a previous note) probably belong to this same class of\r\nphenomena.\r\n\r\nThese fringes of stratified gravel occur along all the great valleys of\r\nthe Cordillera, as well as along their main branches; they are\r\nstrikingly developed in the valleys of the Maypu, Mendoza, Aconcagua,\r\nCachapual, and according to Meyen, in the Tinguirica. (“Reise” etc. Th.\r\n1 s. 302.) In the valleys, however, of Northern Chile, and in some on\r\nthe eastern flank of the Cordillera, as in the Portillo Valley, where\r\nstreams have never flowed, or are quite insignificant in volume, the\r\npresence of a mass of stratified gravel can be inferred only from the\r\nsmooth slightly concave form of the bottom. One naturally seeks for\r\nsome explanation of so general and striking a phenomenon; that the\r\nmatter forming the fringes along the valleys, or still filling up their\r\nentire beds, has not fallen from the adjoining mountains like common\r\ndetritus, is evident from the complete contrast in every respect\r\nbetween the gravel and the piles of detritus, whether seen high up the\r\nvalleys on their sides, or low down in front of the more precipitous\r\nravines; that the matter has not been deposited by debacles, even if we\r\ncould believe in debacles having rushed down EVERY valley, and all\r\ntheir branches, eastward and westward from the central pinnacles of the\r\nCordillera, we must admit from the following reasons,—from the distinct\r\nstratification of the mass,—its smooth upper surface,—the well-rounded\r\nand sometimes encrusted state of the pebbles, so different from the\r\nloose debris on the mountains,—and especially from the terraces\r\npreserving their uniform inclination round the most abrupt bends. To\r\nsuppose that as the land now stands, the rivers deposited the shingle\r\nalong the course of every valley, and all their main branches, appears\r\nto me preposterous, seeing that these same rivers not only are now\r\nremoving and have removed much of this deposit, but are everywhere\r\ntending to cut deep and narrow gorges in the hard underlying rocks.\r\n\r\nI have stated that these fringes of gravel, the origin of which are\r\ninexplicable on the notion of debacles or of ordinary alluvial action,\r\nare directly continuous with the similarly-composed basin-like plains\r\nat the foot of the Cordillera, which, from the several reasons before\r\nassigned, I cannot doubt were modelled by the agency of the sea. Now if\r\nwe suppose that the sea formerly occupied the valleys of the Chilean\r\nCordillera, in precisely the same manner as it now does in the more\r\nsouthern parts of the continent, where deep winding creeks penetrate\r\ninto the very heart of, and in the case of Obstruction Sound quite\r\nthrough, this great range; and if we suppose that the mountains were\r\nupraised in the same slow manner as the eastern and western coasts have\r\nbeen upraised within the recent period, then the origin and formation\r\nof these sloping, terrace-like fringes of gravel can be simply\r\nexplained. For every part of the bottom of each valley will, on this\r\nview, have long stood at the head of a sea creek, into which the then\r\nexisting torrents will have delivered fragments of rocks, where, by the\r\naction of the tides, they will have been rolled, sometimes encrusted,\r\nrudely stratified, and the whole surface levelled by the blending\r\ntogether of the successive beach lines. (Sloping terraces of precisely\r\nsimilar structure have been described by me “Philosophical\r\nTransactions” 1839 page 58, in the valleys of Lochaber in Scotland,\r\nwhere, at higher levels, the parallel roads of Glen Roy show the marks\r\nof the long and quiet residence of the sea. I have no doubt that these\r\nsloping terraces would have been present in the valleys of most of the\r\nEuropean ranges, had not every trace of them, and all wrecks of\r\nsea-action, been swept away by the glaciers which have since occupied\r\nthem. I have shown that this is the case with the mountains (“London\r\nand Edinburgh Philosophical Journal” volume 21 page 187) of North\r\nWales.) As the land rose, the torrents in every valley will have tended\r\nto have removed the matter which just before had been arrested on, or\r\nnear, the beach-lines; the torrents, also, having continued to gain in\r\nforce by the continued elevation increasing their total descent from\r\ntheir sources to the sea. This slow rising of the Cordillera, which\r\nexplains so well the otherwise inexplicable origin and structure of the\r\nterraces, judging from all known analogies, will probably have been\r\ninterrupted by many periods of rest; but we ought not to expect to find\r\nany evidence of these periods in the structure of the gravel- terraces:\r\nfor, as the waves at the heads of deep creeks have little erosive\r\npower, so the only effect of the sea having long remained at the same\r\nlevel will be that the upper parts of the creeks will have become\r\nfilled up at such periods to the level of the water with gravel and\r\nsand; and that afterwards the rivers will have thrown down on the\r\nfilled-up parts a talus of similar matter, of which the inclination (as\r\nat the head of a partially filled-up lake) will have been determined by\r\nthe supply of detritus, and the force of the stream. (I have attempted\r\nto explain this process in a more detailed manner, in a letter to Mr.\r\nMaclaren, published in the “Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal” volume\r\n35 page 288.) Hence, after the final conversion of the creeks into\r\nvalleys, almost the only difference in the terraces at those points at\r\nwhich the sea stood long, will be a somewhat more gentle inclination,\r\nwith river-worn instead of sea-worn detritus on the surface.\r\n\r\nI know of only one difficulty on the foregoing view, namely, the far-\r\ntransported blocks of rock high on the sides of the valley of the\r\nCachapual: I will not attempt any explanation of this phenomenon, but I\r\nmay state my belief that a mountain-ridge near the Baths of Cauquenes\r\nhas been upraised long subsequently to all the other ranges in the\r\nneighbourhood, and that when this was effected the whole face of the\r\ncountry must have been greatly altered. In the course of ages,\r\nmoreover, in this and other valleys, events may have occurred like, but\r\neven on a grander scale than, that described by Molina, when a slip\r\nduring the earthquake of 1762 banked up for ten days the great River\r\nLontue, which then bursting its barrier “inundated the whole country,”\r\nand doubtless transported many great fragments of rock. (“Compendio de\r\nla Hist.” etc. etc. tome 1 page 30. M. Brongniart, in his report on M.\r\nGay’s labours “Annales des Sciences” 1833, considers that the boulders\r\nin the Cachapual belong to the same class with the erratic boulders of\r\nEurope. As the blocks which I saw are not gigantic, and especially as\r\nthey are not angular, and as they have not been transported fairly\r\nacross low spaces or wide valleys, I am unwilling to class them with\r\nthose which, both in the northern and southern hemisphere “Geological\r\nTransactions” volume 6 page 415, have been transported by ice. It is to\r\nbe hoped that when M. Gay’s long-continued and admirable labours in\r\nChile are published, more light will be thrown on this subject.\r\nHowever, the boulders may have been primarily transported; the final\r\nposition of those of porphyry, which have been described as arranged at\r\nthe foot of the mountain in rude lines, I cannot doubt, has been due to\r\nthe action of waves on a beach. The valley of the Cachapual, in the\r\npart where the boulders occur, bursts through the high ridge of\r\nCauquenes, which runs parallel to, but at some distance from, the\r\nCordillera. This ridge has been subjected to excessive violence;\r\ntrachytic lava has burst from it, and hot springs yet flow at its base.\r\nSeeing the enormous amount of denudation of solid rock in the upper and\r\nmuch broader parts of this valley where it enters the Cordillera, and\r\nseeing to what extent the ridge of Cauquenes now protects the great\r\nrange, I could not help believing (as alluded to in the text) that this\r\nridge with its trachytic eruptions had been thrown up at a much later\r\nperiod than the Cordillera. If this has been the case, the boulders,\r\nafter having been transported to a low level by the torrents (which\r\nexhibit in every valley proofs of their power of moving great\r\nfragments), may have been raised up to their present height, with the\r\nland on which they rested.) Finally, notwithstanding this one case of\r\ndifficulty, I cannot entertain any doubt, that these terrace-like\r\nfringes, which are continuously united with the basin-shaped plains at\r\nthe foot of the Cordillera, have been formed by the arrestment of\r\nriver-borne detritus at successive levels, in the same manner as we see\r\nnow taking place at the heads of all those many, deep, winding fiords\r\nintersecting the southern coasts. To my mind, this has been one of the\r\nmost important conclusions to which my observations on the geology of\r\nSouth America have led me; for we thus learn that one of the grandest\r\nand most symmetrical mountain-chains in the world, with its several\r\nparallel lines, has been together uplifted in mass between seven and\r\nnine thousand feet, in the same gradual manner as have the eastern and\r\nwestern coasts within the recent period. (I do not wish to affirm that\r\nall the lines have been uplifted quite equally; slight differences in\r\nthe elevation would leave no perceptible effect on the terraces. It\r\nmay, however, be inferred, perhaps with one exception, that since the\r\nperiod when the sea occupied these valleys, the several ranges have not\r\nbeen dislocated by GREAT and ABRUPT faults or upheavals; for if such\r\nhad occurred, the terraces of gravel at these points would not have\r\nbeen continuous. The one exception is at the lower end of a plain in\r\nthe Valle del Yeso (a branch of the Maypu), where, at a great height,\r\nthe terraces and valley appear to have been broken through by a line of\r\nupheaval, of which the evidence is plain in the adjoining mountains;\r\nthis dislocation, perhaps, occurred AFTER THE ELEVATION of this part of\r\nthe valley above the level of the sea. The valley here is almost\r\nblocked up by a pile about one thousand feet in thickness, formed, as\r\nfar as I could judge, from three sides, entirely, or at least in chief\r\npart, of gravel and detritus. On the south side, the river has cut\r\nquite through this mass; on the northern side, and on the very summit,\r\ndeep ravines, parallel to the line of the valley, are worn, as if the\r\ndrainage from the valley above had passed by these two lines before\r\nfollowing its present course.)\r\n\r\nFORMATION OF VALLEYS.\r\n\r\nThe bulk of solid rock which has been removed in the lower parts of the\r\nvalleys of the Cordillera has been enormous. It is only by reflecting\r\non such cases as that of the gravel beds of Patagonia, covering so many\r\nthousand square leagues of surface, and which, if heaped into a ridge,\r\nwould form a mountain-range almost equal to the Cordillera, that the\r\namount of denudation becomes credible. The valleys within this range\r\noften follow anticlinal but rarely synclinal lines; that is, the strata\r\non the two sides more often dip from the line of valley than towards\r\nit. On the flanks of the range, the valleys most frequently run neither\r\nalong anticlinal nor synclinal axes, but along lines of flexure or\r\nfaults: that is, the strata on both sides dip in the same direction,\r\nbut with different, though often only slightly different, inclinations.\r\nAs most of the nearly parallel ridges which together form the\r\nCordillera run approximately north and south, the east and west valleys\r\ncross them in zig-zag lines, bursting through the points where the\r\nstrata have been least inclined. No doubt the greater part of the\r\ndenudation was affected at the periods when tidal- creeks occupied the\r\nvalleys, and when the outer flanks of the mountains were exposed to the\r\nfull force of an open ocean. I have already alluded to the power of the\r\ntidal action in the channels connecting great bays; and I may here\r\nmention that one of the surveying vessels in a channel of this kind,\r\nthough under sail, was whirled round and round by the force of the\r\ncurrent. We shall hereafter see, that of the two main ridges forming\r\nthe Chilean Cordillera, the eastern and loftiest one owes the greater\r\npart of its ANGULAR upheaval to a period subsequent to the elevation of\r\nthe western ridge; and it is likewise probable that many of the other\r\nparallel ridges have been angularly upheaved at different periods;\r\nconsequently many parts of the surfaces of these mountains must\r\nformerly have been exposed to the full force of the waves, which, if\r\nthe Cordillera were now sunk into the sea, would be protected by\r\nparallel chains of islands. The torrents in the valleys certainly have\r\ngreat power in wearing the rocks; as could be told by the dull rattling\r\nsound of the many fragments night and day hurrying downwards; and as\r\nwas attested by the vast size of certain fragments, which I was assured\r\nhad been carried onwards during floods; yet we have seen in the lower\r\nparts of the valleys, that the torrents have seldom removed all the\r\nsea-checked shingle forming the terraces, and have had time since the\r\nlast elevation in mass only to cut in the underlying rocks, gorges,\r\ndeep and narrow, but quite insignificant in dimensions compared with\r\nthe entire width and depth of the valleys.\r\n\r\nAlong the shores of the Pacific, I never ceased during my many and long\r\nexcursions to feel astonished at seeing every valley, ravine, and even\r\nlittle inequality of surface, both in the hard granitic and soft\r\ntertiary districts, retaining the exact outline, which they had when\r\nthe sea left their surfaces coated with organic remains. When these\r\nremains shall have decayed, there will be scarcely any difference in\r\nappearance between this line of coast-land and most other countries,\r\nwhich we are accustomed to believe have assumed their present features\r\nchiefly through the agency of the weather and fresh-water streams. In\r\nthe old granitic districts, no doubt it would be rash to attribute all\r\nthe modifications of outline exclusively to the sea-action; for who can\r\nsay how often this lately submerged coast may not previously have\r\nexisted as land, worn by running streams and washed by rain? This\r\nsource of doubt, however, does not apply to the districts superficially\r\nformed of the modern tertiary deposits. The valleys worn by the sea,\r\nthrough the softer formations, both on the Atlantic and Pacific sides\r\nof the continent, are generally broad, winding, and flat-bottomed: the\r\nonly district of this nature now penetrated by arms of the sea, is the\r\nisland of Chiloe.\r\n\r\nFinally, the conclusion at which I have arrived, with respect to the\r\nrelative powers of rain and sea water on the land, is, that the latter\r\nis far the most efficient agent, and that its chief tendency is to\r\nwiden the valleys; whilst torrents and rivers tend to deepen them, and\r\nto remove the wreck of the sea’s destroying action. As the waves have\r\nmore power, the more open and exposed the space may be, so will they\r\nalways tend to widen more and more the mouths of valleys compared with\r\ntheir upper parts: hence, doubtless, it is, that most valleys expand at\r\ntheir mouths,—that part, at which the rivers flowing in them, generally\r\nhave the least wearing power.\r\n\r\nWhen reflecting on the action of the sea on the land at former levels,\r\nthe effect of the great waves, which generally accompany earthquakes,\r\nmust not be overlooked: few years pass without a severe earthquake\r\noccurring on some part of the west coast of South America; and the\r\nwaves thus caused have great power. At Concepcion, after the shock of\r\n1835, I saw large slabs of sandstone, one of which was six feet long,\r\nthree in breadth, and two in thickness, thrown high up on the beach;\r\nand from the nature of the marine animals still adhering to it, it must\r\nhave been torn up from a considerable depth. On the other hand, at\r\nCallao, the recoil-wave of the earthquake of 1746 carried great masses\r\nof brickwork, between three and four feet square, some way out seaward.\r\nDuring the course of ages, the effect thus produced at each successive\r\nlevel, cannot have been small; and in some of the tertiary deposits on\r\nthis line of coast, I observed great boulders of granite and other\r\nneighbouring rocks, embedded in fine sedimentary layers, the\r\ntransportal of which, except by the means of earthquake-waves, always\r\nappeared to me inexplicable.\r\n\r\nSUPERFICIAL SALINE DEPOSITS.\r\n\r\nThis subject may be here conveniently treated of: I will begin with the\r\nmost interesting case, namely, the superficial saline beds near Iquique\r\nin Peru. The porphyritic mountains on the coast rise abruptly to a\r\nheight of between one thousand nine hundred and three thousand feet:\r\nbetween their summits and an inland plain, on which the celebrated\r\ndeposit of nitrate of soda lies, there is a high undulatory district,\r\ncovered by a remarkable superficial saliferous crust, chiefly composed\r\nof common salt, either in white, hard, opaque nodules, or mingled with\r\nsand, in this latter case forming a compact sandstone. This saliferous\r\nsuperficial crust extends from the edge of the coast-escarpment, over\r\nthe whole face of the country; but never attains, as I am assured by\r\nMr. Bollaert (long resident here) any great thickness. Although a very\r\nslight shower falls only at intervals of many years, yet small\r\nfunnel-shaped cavities show that the salt has been in some parts\r\ndissolved. (It is singular how slowly, according to the observations of\r\nM. Cordier on the salt-mountain of Cardona in Spain “Ann. des Mines,\r\nTranslation of Geolog. Mem.” by De la Beche page 60, salt is dissolved,\r\nwhere the amount of rain is supposed to be as much as 31.4 of an inch\r\nin the year. It is calculated that only five feet in thickness is\r\ndissolved in the course of a century.) In several places I saw large\r\npatches of sand, quite moist, owing to the quantity of muriate of lime\r\n(as ascertained by Mr. T. Reeks) contained in them. From the compact\r\nsalt- cemented sand being either red, purplish, or yellow, according to\r\nthe colour of the rocky strata on which it rested, I imagined that this\r\nsubstance had probably been derived through common alluvial action from\r\nthe layers of salt which occur interstratified in the surrounding\r\nmountains (“Journal of Researches” page 444 first edition.): but from\r\nthe interesting details given by M. d’Orbigny, and from finding on a\r\nfresh examination of this agglomerated sand, that it is not irregularly\r\ncemented, but consists of thin layers of sand of different tints of\r\ncolour, alternating with excessively fine parallel layers of salt, I\r\nconclude that it is not of alluvial origin. M. d’Orbigny observed\r\nanalogous saline beds extending from Cobija for five degrees of\r\nlatitude northward, and at heights varying from six hundred to nine\r\nhundred feet (“Voyage” etc. page 102. M. d’Orbigny found this deposit\r\nintersected, in many places, by deep ravines, in which there was no\r\nsalt. Streams must once, though historically unknown, have flowed in\r\nthem; and M. d’Orbigny argues from the presence of undissolved salt\r\nover the whole surrounding country, that the streams must have arisen\r\nfrom rain or snow having fallen, not in the adjoining country, but on\r\nthe now arid Cordillera. I may remark, that from having observed ruins\r\nof Indian buildings in absolutely sterile parts of the Chilian\r\nCordillera (“Journal” 2nd edition page 357), I am led to believe that\r\nthe climate, at a time when Indian man inhabited this part of the\r\ncontinent, was in some slight degree more humid than it is at\r\npresent.): from finding recent sea- shells strewed on these saliferous\r\nbeds, and under them, great well-rounded blocks, exactly like those on\r\nthe existing beach, he believes that the salt, which is invariably\r\nsuperficial, has been left by the evaporation of the sea-water. This\r\nsame conclusion must, I now believe, be extended to the superficial\r\nsaliferous beds of Iquique, though they stand about three thousand feet\r\nabove the level of the sea.\r\n\r\nAssociated with the salt in the superficial beds, there are numerous,\r\nthin, horizontal layers of impure, dirty-white, friable, gypseous and\r\ncalcareous tuffs. The gypseous beds are very remarkable, from abounding\r\nwith, so as sometimes to be almost composed of, irregular concretions,\r\nfrom the size of an egg to that of a man’s head, of very hard, compact,\r\nheavy gypsum, in the form of anhydrite. This gypsum contains some\r\nforeign particles of stone; it is stained, judging from its action with\r\nborax, with iron, and it exhales a strong aluminous odour. The surfaces\r\nof the concretions are marked by sharp, radiating, or bifurcating\r\nridges, as if they had been (but not really) corroded: internally they\r\nare penetrated by branching veins (like those of calcareous spar in the\r\nseptaria of the London clay) of pure white anhydrite. These veins might\r\nnaturally have been thought to have been formed by subsequent\r\ninfiltration, had not each little embedded fragment of rock been\r\nlikewise edged in a very remarkable manner by a narrow border of the\r\nsame white anhydrite: this shows that the veins must have been formed\r\nby a process of segregation, and not of infiltration. Some of the\r\nlittle included and CRACKED fragments of foreign rock are penetrated by\r\nthe anhydrite, and portions have evidently been thus mechanically\r\ndisplaced: at St. Helena, I observed that calcareous matter, deposited\r\nby rain water, also had the power to separate small fragments of rock\r\nfrom the larger masses. (“Volcanic Islands” etc. page 87.) I believe\r\nthe superficial gypseous deposit is widely extended: I received\r\nspecimens of it from Pisagua, forty miles north of Iquique, and\r\nlikewise from Arica, where it coats a layer of pure salt. M. d’Orbigny\r\nfound at Cobija a bed of clay, lying above a mass of upraised recent\r\nshells, which was saturated with sulphate of soda, and included thin\r\nlayers of fibrous gypsum. (“Voyage Geolog.” etc. page 95.) These widely\r\nextended, superficial, beds of salt and gypsum, appear to me an\r\ninteresting geological phenomenon, which could be presented only under\r\na very dry climate.\r\n\r\nThe plain or basin, on the borders of which the famous bed of nitrate\r\nof soda lies, is situated at the distance of about thirty miles from\r\nthe sea, being separated from it by the saliferous district just\r\ndescribed. It stands at a height of 3,300 feet; its surface is level,\r\nand some leagues in width; it extends forty miles northward, and has a\r\ntotal length (as I was informed by Mr. Belford Wilson, the\r\nConsul-General at Lima) of 420 miles. In a well near the works,\r\nthirty-six yards in depth, sand, earth, and a little gravel were found:\r\nin another well, near Almonte, fifty yards deep, the whole consisted,\r\naccording to Mr. Blake, of clay, including a layer of sand two feet\r\nthick, which rested on fine gravel, and this on coarse gravel, with\r\nlarge rounded fragments of rock. (See an admirable paper “Geological\r\nand Miscellaneous Notices of Tarapaca” in “Silliman’s American Journal”\r\nvolume 44 page 1.) In many parts of this now utterly desert plain,\r\nrushes and large prostrate trees in a hardened state, apparently\r\nMimosas, are found buried, at a depth from three to six feet; according\r\nto Mr. Blake, they have all fallen to the south-west. The bed of\r\nnitrate of soda is said to extend for forty to fifty leagues along the\r\nwestern margin of the plain, but is not found in its central parts: it\r\nis from two to three feet in thickness, and is so hard that it is\r\ngenerally blasted with gunpowder; it slopes gently upwards from the\r\nedge of the plain to between ten and thirty feet above its level. It\r\nrests on sand in which, it is said, vegetable remains and broken shells\r\nhave been found; shells have also been found, according to Mr. Blake,\r\nboth on and in the nitrate of soda. It is covered by a superficial mass\r\nof sand, containing nodules of common salt, and, as I was assured by a\r\nminer, much soft gypseous matter, precisely like that in the\r\nsuperficial crust already described: certainly this crust, with its\r\ncharacteristic concretions of anhydrite, comes close down to the edge\r\nof the plain.\r\n\r\nThe nitrate of soda varies in purity in different parts, and often\r\ncontains nodules of common salt. According to Mr. Blake, the proportion\r\nof nitrate of soda varies from 20 to 75 per cent. An analysis by Mr. A.\r\nHayes, of an average specimen, gave:—\r\n\r\n   Nitrate of Soda.... 64.98\r\n   Sulphate of Soda.... 3.00\r\n   Chloride of Soda... 28.69\r\n   Iodic Salts......... 0.63\r\n   Shells and Marl..... 2.60\r\n                       99.90\r\n\r\nThe “mother-water” at some of the refineries is very rich in iodic\r\nsalts, and is supposed to contain much muriate of lime. (“Literary\r\nGazette” 1841 page 475.) In an unrefined specimen brought home by\r\nmyself, Mr. T. Reeks has ascertained that the muriate of lime is very\r\nabundant. With respect to the origin of this saline mass, from the\r\nmanner in which the gently inclined, compact bed follows for so many\r\nmiles the sinuous margin of the plain, there can be no doubt that it\r\nwas deposited from a sheet of water: from the fragments of embedded\r\nshells, from the abundant iodic salts, from the superficial saliferous\r\ncrust occurring at a higher level and being probably of marine origin,\r\nand from the plain resembling in form those of Chile and that of\r\nUspallata, there can be little doubt that this sheet of water was, at\r\nleast originally, connected with the sea. (From an official document,\r\nshown me by Mr. Belford Wilson, it appears that the first export of\r\nnitrate of soda to Europe was in July 1830, on French account, in a\r\nBritish ship:—\r\n\r\n   In year, the entire export was in Quintals.\r\n   1830............................ 17,300\r\n   1831............................ 40,885\r\n   1832............................ 51,400\r\n   1833............................ 91,335\r\n   1834........................... 149,538\r\n   The Spanish quintal nearly equals 100 English pounds.)\r\n\r\nTHIN, SUPERFICIAL, SALINE INCRUSTATIONS.\r\n\r\nThese saline incrustations are common in many parts of America:\r\nHumboldt met with them on the tableland of Mexico, and the Jesuit\r\nFalkner and other authors state that they occur at intervals over the\r\nvast plains extending from the mouth of the Plata to Rioja and\r\nCatamarca. (Azara “Travels” volume 1 page 55, considers that the Parana\r\nis the eastern boundary of the saliferous region; but I heard of\r\n“salitrales” in the Province of Entre Rios.) Hence it is that during\r\ndroughts, most of the streams in the Pampas are saline. I nowhere met\r\nwith these incrustations so abundantly as near Bahia Blanca: square\r\nmiles of the mud-flats, which near that place are raised only a few\r\nfeet above the sea, just enough to protect them from being overflowed,\r\nappear, after dry weather, whiter than the ground after the thickest\r\nhoar-frost. After rain the salts disappear, and every puddle of water\r\nbecomes highly saline; as the surface dries, the capillary action draws\r\nthe moisture up pieces of broken earth, dead sticks, and tufts of\r\ngrass, where the salt effloresces. The incrustation, where thickest,\r\ndoes not exceed a quarter of an inch. M. Parchappe has analysed it (M.\r\nd’Orbigny “Voyage” etc. Part. Hist. tome 1 page 664.); and finds that\r\nthe specimens collected at the extreme head of the low plain, near the\r\nRiver Manuello, consist of 93 per cent of sulphate of soda, and 7 of\r\ncommon salt; whilst the specimens taken close to the coast contain only\r\n63 per cent of the sulphate, and 37 of the muriate of soda. This\r\nremarkable fact, together with our knowledge that the whole of this low\r\nmuddy plain has been covered by the sea within the recent period, must\r\nlead to the suspicion that the common salt, by some unknown process,\r\nbecomes in time changed into the sulphate. Friable, calcareous matter\r\nis here abundant, and the case of the apparent double decomposition of\r\nthe shells and salt on San Lorenzo, should not be forgotten.\r\n\r\nThe saline incrustations, near Bahia Blanca, are not confined to,\r\nthough most abundant on, the low muddy flats; for I noticed some on a\r\ncalcareous plain between thirty and forty feet above the sea, and even\r\na little occurs in still higher valleys. Low alluvial tracts in the\r\nvalleys of the Rivers Negro and Colorado are also encrusted, and in the\r\nlatter valley such spaces appeared to be occasionally overflowed by the\r\nriver. I observed saline incrustations in some of the valleys of\r\nSouthern Patagonia. At Port Desire a low, flat, muddy valley was\r\nthickly incrusted by salts, which on analysis by Mr. T. Reeks, are\r\nfound to consist of a mixture of sulphate and muriate of soda, with\r\ncarbonate of lime and earthy matter. On the western side of the\r\ncontinent, the southern coasts are much too humid for this phenomenon;\r\nbut in Northern Chile I again met with similar incrustations. On the\r\nhardened mud, in parts of the broad, flat-bottomed valley of Copiapo,\r\nthe saline matter encrusts the ground to the thickness of some inches:\r\nspecimens, sent by Mr. Bingley to Apothecaries’ Hall for analysis, were\r\nsaid to consist of carbonate and sulphate of soda. Much sulphate of\r\nsoda is found in the desert of Atacama. In all parts of South America,\r\nthe saline incrustations occur most frequently on low damp surfaces of\r\nmud, where the climate is rather dry; and these low surfaces have, in\r\nalmost every case, been upraised above the level of the sea, within the\r\nrecent period.\r\n\r\nSALT-LAKES OF PATAGONIA AND LA PLATA.\r\n\r\nSalinas, or natural salt-lakes, occur in various formations on the\r\neastern side of the continent,—in the argillaceo-calcareous deposit of\r\nthe Pampas, in the sandstone of the Rio Negro, where they are very\r\nnumerous, in the pumiceous and other beds of the Patagonian tertiary\r\nformation, and in small primary districts in the midst of this latter\r\nformation. Port S. Julian is the most southerly point (latitude 49\r\ndegrees to 50 degrees) at which salinas are known to occur. (According\r\nto Azara “Travels” volume 1 page 56, there are salt-lakes as far north\r\nas Chaco (latitude 25 degrees), on the banks of the Vermejo. The\r\nsalt-lakes of Siberia appear (Pallas “Travels” English Translation\r\nvolume 1 page 284) to occur in very similar depressions to those of\r\nPatagonia.) The depressions, in which these salt-lakes lie, are from a\r\nfew feet to sixty metres, as asserted by M. d’Orbigny, below the\r\nsurface of the surrounding plains (“Voyage Geolog.” page 63.); and,\r\naccording to this same author, near the Rio Negro they all trend,\r\neither in the N.E. and S.W. or in E. and W. lines, coincident with the\r\ngeneral slope of the plain. These depressions in the plain generally\r\nhave one side lower than the others, but there are no outlets for\r\ndrainage. Under a less dry climate, an outlet would soon have been\r\nformed, and the salt washed away. The salinas occur at different\r\nelevations above the sea; they are often several leagues in diameter;\r\nthey are generally very shallow, but there is a deep one in a\r\nquartz-rock formation near C. Blanco. In the wet season, the whole, or\r\na part, of the salt is dissolved, being redeposited during the\r\nsucceeding dry season. At this period the appearance of the snow-white\r\nexpanse of salt crystallised in great cubes, is very striking. In a\r\nlarge salina, northward of the Rio Negro, the salt at the bottom,\r\nduring the whole year, is between two and three feet in thickness.\r\n\r\nThe salt rests almost always on a thick bed of black muddy sand, which\r\nis fetid, probably from the decay of the burrowing worms inhabiting it.\r\n(Professor Ehrenberg examined some of this muddy sand, but was unable\r\nto find in it any infusoria.) In a salina, situated about fifteen miles\r\nabove the town of El Carmen on the Rio Negro, and three or four miles\r\nfrom the banks of that river, I observed that this black mud rested on\r\ngravel with a calcareous matrix, similar to that spread over the whole\r\nsurrounding plains: at Port S. Julian the mud, also, rested on the\r\ngravel: hence the depressions must have been formed anteriorly to, or\r\ncontemporaneously with, the spreading out of the gravel. I was informed\r\nthat one small salina occurs in an alluvial plain within the valley of\r\nthe Rio Negro, and therefore its origin must be subsequent to the\r\nexcavation of that valley. When I visited the salina, fifteen miles\r\nabove the town, the salt was beginning to crystallise, and on the muddy\r\nbottom there were lying many crystals, generally placed crossways of\r\nsulphate of soda (as ascertained by Mr. Reeks), and embedded in the\r\nmud, numerous crystals of sulphate of lime, from one to three inches in\r\nlength: M. d’Orbigny states that some of these crystals are acicular\r\nand more than even nine inches in length (“Voyage Geolog.” page 64.);\r\nothers are macled and of great purity: those I found all contained some\r\nsand in their centres. As the black and fetid sand overlies the gravel,\r\nand that overlies the regular tertiary strata, I think there can be no\r\ndoubt that these remarkable crystals of sulphate of lime have been\r\ndeposited from the waters of the lake. The inhabitants call the\r\ncrystals of selenite, the padre del sal, and those of the sulphate of\r\nsoda, the madre del sal; they assured me that both are found under the\r\nsame circumstances in several of the neighbouring salinas; and that the\r\nsulphate of soda is annually dissolved, and is always crystallised\r\nbefore the common salt on the muddy bottom. (This is what might have\r\nbeen expected; for M. Ballard asserts “Acad. des Sciences” October 7,\r\n1844, that sulphate of soda is precipitated from solution more readily\r\nfrom water containing muriate of soda in excess, than from pure water.)\r\nThe association of gypsum and salt in this case, as well as in the\r\nsuperficial deposits of Iquique, appears to me interesting, considering\r\nhow generally these substances are associated in the older stratified\r\nformations.\r\n\r\nMr. Reeks has analysed for me some of the salt from the salina near the\r\nRio Negro; he finds it composed entirely of chloride of sodium, with\r\nthe exception of 0.26 of sulphate of lime and of 0.22 of earthy matter:\r\nthere are no traces of iodic salts. Some salt from the salina\r\nChiquitos, in the Pampean formation, is equally pure. It is a singular\r\nfact, that the salt from these salinas does not serve so well for\r\npreserving meat, as sea-salt from the Cape de Verde Islands; and a\r\nmerchant at Buenos Ayres told me that he considered it as 50 per cent\r\nless valuable. The purity of the Patagonian salt, or absence from it of\r\nthose other saline bodies found in all sea- water, is the only\r\nassignable cause for this inferiority; a conclusion which is supported\r\nby the fact lately ascertained, that those salts answer best for\r\npreserving cheese which contain most of the deliquescent chlorides.\r\n(“Horticultural and Agricultural Gazette” 1845 page 93.) (It would\r\nprobably well answer for the merchants of Buenos Ayres (considering the\r\ngreat consumption there of salt for preserving meat) to import the\r\ndeliquescent chlorides to mix with the salt from the salinas: I may\r\ncall attention to the fact, that at Iquique, a large quantity of\r\nmuriate of lime, left in the MOTHER-WATER during the refinement of the\r\nnitrate of soda, is annually thrown away.)\r\n\r\nWith respect to the origin of the salt in the salinas, the foregoing\r\nanalysis seems opposed to the view entertained by M. d’Orbigny and\r\nothers, and which seems so probable considering the recent elevation of\r\nthis line of coast, namely, that it is due to the evaporation of\r\nsea-water and to the drainage from the surrounding strata impregnated\r\nwith sea-salt. I was informed (I know not whether accurately) that on\r\nthe northern side of the salina on the Rio Negro, there is a small\r\nbrine spring which flows at all times of the year: if this be so, the\r\nsalt in this case at least, probably is of subterranean origin. It at\r\nfirst appears very singular that fresh water can often be procured in\r\nwells, and is sometimes found in small lakes, quite close to these\r\nsalinas. (Sir W. Parish states “Buenos Ayres” etc. pages 122 and 170,\r\nthat this is the case near the great salinas westward of the S.\r\nVentana. I have seen similar statements in an ancient MS. Journal\r\nlately published by S. Angelis. At Iquique, where the surface is so\r\nthickly encrusted with saline matter, I tasted water only slightly\r\nbrackish, procured in a well thirty-six yards deep; but here one feels\r\nless surprise at its presence, as pure water might percolate under\r\nground from the not very distant Cordillera.) I am not aware that this\r\nfact bears particularly on the origin of the salt; but perhaps it is\r\nrather opposed to the view of the salt having been washed out of the\r\nsurrounding superficial strata, but not to its having been the residue\r\nof sea-water, left in depressions as the land was slowly elevated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\nON THE FORMATIONS OF THE PAMPAS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMineralogical constitution.—Microscopical structure.—Buenos Ayres,\r\nshells embedded in tosca-rock.—Buenos Ayres to the Colorado.—San\r\nVentana.—Bahia Blanca; M.

It has upon the whole a very uniform character:\r\nconsisting of a more or less dull reddish, slightly indurated,\r\nargillaceous earth or mud, often, but not always, including in\r\nhorizontal lines concretions of marl, and frequently passing into a\r\ncompact marly rock. The mud, wherever I examined it, even close to the\r\nconcretions, did not contain any carbonate of lime. The concretions are\r\ngenerally nodular, sometimes rough externally, sometimes\r\nstalactiformed; they are of a compact structure, but often penetrated\r\n(as well as the mud) by hair-like serpentine cavities, and occasionally\r\nwith irregular fissures in their centres, lined with minute crystals of\r\ncarbonate of lime; they are of white, brown, or pale pinkish tints,\r\noften marked by black dendritic manganese or iron; they are either\r\ndarker or lighter tinted than the surrounding mass; they contain much\r\ncarbonate of lime, but exhale a strong aluminous odour, and leave, when\r\ndissolved in acids, a large but varying residue, of which the greater\r\npart consists of sand. These concretions often unite into irregular\r\nstrata; and over very large tracts of country, the entire mass consists\r\nof a hard, but generally cavernous marly rock: some of the varieties\r\nmight be called calcareous tuffs.\r\n\r\nDr. Carpenter has kindly examined under the microscope, sliced and\r\npolished specimens of these concretions, and of the solid marl-rock,\r\ncollected in various places between the Colorado and Santa Fe Bajada.\r\nIn the greater number, Dr. Carpenter finds that the whole substance\r\npresents a tolerably uniform amorphous character, but with traces of\r\nincipient crystalline metamorphosis; in other specimens he finds\r\nmicroscopically minute rounded concretions of an amorphous substance\r\n(resembling in size those in oolitic rocks, but not having a concentric\r\nstructure), united by a cement which is often crystalline. In some, Dr.\r\nCarpenter can perceive distinct traces of shells, corals, Polythalamia,\r\nand rarely of spongoid bodies. For the sake of comparison, I sent Dr.\r\nCarpenter specimens of the calcareous rock, formed chiefly of fragments\r\nof recent shells, from Coquimbo in Chile: in one of these specimens,\r\nDr. Carpenter finds, besides the larger fragments, microscopical\r\nparticles of shells, and a varying quantity of opaque amorphous matter;\r\nin another specimen from the same bed, he finds the whole composed of\r\nthe amorphous matter, with layers showing indications of an incipient\r\ncrystalline metamorphosis: hence these latter specimens, both in\r\nexternal appearance and in microscopical structure, closely resemble\r\nthose of the Pampas. Dr. Carpenter informs me that it is well known\r\nthat chemical precipitation throws down carbonate of lime in the opaque\r\namorphous state; and he is inclined to believe that the long-continued\r\nattrition of a calcareous body in a state of crystalline or\r\nsemi-crystalline aggregation (as, for instance, in the ordinary shells\r\nof Mollusca, which, when sliced, are transparent) may yield the same\r\nresult. From the intimate relations between all the Coquimbo specimens,\r\nI can hardly doubt that the amorphous carbonate of lime in them has\r\nresulted from the attrition and decay of the larger fragments of shell:\r\nwhether the amorphous matter in the marly rocks of the Pampas has\r\nlikewise thus originated, it would be hazardous to conjecture.\r\n\r\nFor convenience’ sake, I will call the marly rock by the name given to\r\nit by the inhabitants, namely, Tosca-rock; and the reddish argillaceous\r\nearth, Pampean mud. This latter substance, I may mention, has been\r\nexamined for me by Professor Ehrenberg, and the result of his\r\nexamination will be given under the proper localities.\r\n\r\nI will commence my descriptions at a central spot, namely, at Buenos\r\nAyres, and thence proceed first southward to the extreme limit of the\r\ndeposit, and afterwards northward. The plain on which Buenos Ayres\r\nstands is from thirty to forty feet in height. The Pampean mud is here\r\nof a rather pale colour, and includes small nearly white nodules, and\r\nother irregular strata of an unusually arenaceous variety of\r\ntosca-rock. In a well at the depth of seventy feet, according to\r\nIgnatio Nunez, much tosca-rock was met with, and at several points, at\r\none hundred feet deep, beds of sand have been found. I have already\r\ngiven a list of the recent marine and estuary shells found in many\r\nparts on the surface near Buenos Ayres, as far as three or four leagues\r\nfrom the Plata. Specimens from near Ensenada, given me by Sir W.\r\nParish, where the rock is quarried just beneath the surface of the\r\nplain, consist of broken bivalves, cemented by and converted into white\r\ncrystalline carbonate of lime. I have already alluded, in the first\r\nchapter, to a specimen (also given me by Sir W. Parish) from the A. del\r\nTristan, in which shells, resembling in every respect the Azara\r\nlabiata, d’Orbigny, as far as their worn condition permits of\r\ncomparison, are embedded in a reddish, softish, somewhat arenaceous\r\nmarly rock: after careful comparison, with the aid of a microscope and\r\nacids, I can perceive no difference between the basis of this rock and\r\nthe specimens collected by me in many parts of the Pampas. I have also\r\nstated, on the authority of Sir W. Parish, that northward of Buenos\r\nAyres, on the highest parts of the plain, about forty feet above the\r\nPlata, and two or three miles from it, numerous shells of the Azara\r\nlabiata (and I believe of Venus sinuosa) occur embedded in a stratified\r\nearthy mass, including small marly concretions, and said to be\r\nprecisely like the great Pampean deposit. Hence we may conclude that\r\nthe mud of the Pampas continued to be deposited to within the period of\r\nthis existing estuary shell. Although this formation is of such immense\r\nextent, I know of no other instance of the presence of shells in it.\r\n\r\nBUENOS AYRES TO THE RIO COLORADO.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of a few metamorphic ridges, the country between\r\nthese two points, a distance of 400 geographical miles, belongs to the\r\nPampean formation, and in the southern part is generally formed of the\r\nharder and more calcareous varieties. I will briefly describe my route:\r\nabout twenty- five miles S.S.W. of the capital, in a well forty yards\r\nin depth, the upper part, and, as I was assured, the entire thickness,\r\nwas formed of dark red Pampean mud without concretions. North of the\r\nRiver Salado, there are many lakes; and on the banks of one (near the\r\nGuardia) there was a little cliff similarly composed, but including\r\nmany nodular and stalactiform concretions: I found here a large piece\r\nof tessellated armour, like that of the Glyptodon, and many fragments\r\nof bones. The cliffs on the Salado consist of pale-coloured Pampean\r\nmud, including and passing into great masses of tosca-rock: here a\r\nskeleton of the Megatherium and the bones of other extinct quadrupeds\r\n(see the list at the end of this chapter) were found. Large quantities\r\nof crystallised gypsum (of which specimens were given me) occur in the\r\ncliffs of this river; and likewise (as I was assured by Mr. Lumb) in\r\nthe Pampean mud on the River Chuelo, seven leagues from Buenos Ayres: I\r\nmention this because M. d’Orbigny lays some stress on the supposed\r\nabsence of this mineral in the Pampean formation.\r\n\r\nSouthward of the Salado the country is low and swampy, with tosca-rock\r\nappearing at long intervals at the surface. On the banks, however, of\r\nthe Tapalguen (sixty miles south of the Salado) there is a large extent\r\nof tosca-rock, some highly compact and even semi-crystalline, overlying\r\npale Pampean mud with the usual concretions. Thirty miles further\r\nsouth, the small quartz-ridge of Tapalguen is fringed on its northern\r\nand southern flank, by little, narrow, flat-topped hills of tosca-rock,\r\nwhich stand higher than the surrounding plain. Between this ridge and\r\nthe Sierra of Guitru-gueyu, a distance of sixty miles, the country is\r\nswampy, with the tosca-rock appearing only in four or five spots: this\r\nsierra, precisely like that of Tapalguen, is bordered by horizontal,\r\noften cliff-bounded, little hills of tosca-rock, higher than the\r\nsurrounding plain. Here, also, a new appearance was presented in some\r\nextensive and level banks of alluvium or detritus of the neighbouring\r\nmetamorphic rocks; but I neglected to observe whether it was stratified\r\nor not. Between Guitru-gueyu and the Sierra Ventana, I crossed a dry\r\nplain of tosca-rock higher than the country hitherto passed over, and\r\nwith small pieces of denuded tableland of the same formation, standing\r\nstill higher.\r\n\r\nThe marly or calcareous beds not only come up nearly horizontally to\r\nthe northern and southern foot of the great quartzose mountains of the\r\nSierra Ventana, but interfold between the parallel ranges. The\r\nsuperficial beds (for I nowhere obtained sections more than twenty feet\r\ndeep) retain, even close to the mountains, their usual character: the\r\nuppermost layer, however, in one place included pebbles of quartz, and\r\nrested on a mass of detritus of the same rock. At the very foot of the\r\nmountains, there were some few piles of quartz and tosca-rock detritus,\r\nincluding land-shells; but at the distance of only half a mile from\r\nthese lofty, jagged, and battered mountains, I could not, to my great\r\nsurprise, find on the boundless surface of the calcareous plain even a\r\nsingle pebble. Quartz- pebbles, however, of considerable size have at\r\nsome period been transported to a distance of between forty and fifty\r\nmiles to the shores of Bahia Blanca. (Schmidtmeyer “Travels in Chile”\r\npage 150, states that he first noticed on the Pampas, very small bits\r\nof red granite, when fifty miles distant from the southern extremity of\r\nthe mountains of Cordova, which project on the plain, like a reef into\r\nthe sea.)\r\n\r\nThe highest peak of the St. Ventana is, by Captain Fitzroy’s\r\nmeasurement, 3,340 feet, and the calcareous plain at its foot (from\r\nobservations taken by some Spanish officers) 840 feet above the\r\nsea-level. (“La Plata” etc. by Sir W. Parish page 146.) On the flanks\r\nof the mountains, at a height of three hundred or four hundred feet\r\nabove the plain, there were a few small patches of conglomerate and\r\nbreccia, firmly cemented by ferruginous matter to the abrupt and\r\nbattered face of the quartz—traces being thus exhibited of ancient\r\nsea-action. The high plain round this range sinks quite insensibly to\r\nthe eye on all sides, except to the north, where its surface is broken\r\ninto low cliffs. Round the Sierras Tapalguen, Guitru-gueyu, and between\r\nthe latter and the Ventana we have seen (and shall hereafter see round\r\nsome hills in Banda Oriental), that the tosca-rock forms low, flat-\r\ntopped, cliff-bounded hills, higher than the surrounding plains of\r\nsimilar composition. From the horizontal stratification and from the\r\nappearance of the broken cliffs, the greater height of the Pampean\r\nformation round these primary hills ought not to be altogether or in\r\nchief part attributed to these several points having been uplifted more\r\nenergetically than the surrounding country, but to the\r\nargillaceo-calcareous mud having collected round them, when they\r\nexisted as islets or submarine rocks, at a greater height, than at the\r\nbottom of the adjoining open sea;—the cliffs having been subsequently\r\nworn during the elevation of the whole country in mass.\r\n\r\nSouthward of the Ventana, the plain extends farther than the eye can\r\nrange; its surface is not very level, having slight depressions with no\r\ndrainage exits; it is generally covered by a few feet in thickness of\r\nsandy earth; and in some places, according to M. Parchappe, by beds of\r\nclay two yards thick. (M. d’Orbigny “Voyage” Part Geolog. pages 47,\r\n48.) On the banks of the Sauce, four leagues S.E. of the Ventana, there\r\nis an imperfect section about two hundred feet in height, displaying in\r\nthe upper part tosca-rock and in the lower part red Pampean mud. At the\r\nsettlement of Bahia Blanca, the uppermost plain is composed of very\r\ncompact, stratified tosca-rock, containing rounded grains of quartz\r\ndistinguishable by the naked eye: the lower plain, on which the\r\nfortress stands, is described by M. Parchappe as composed of solid\r\ntosca-rock (Ibid.); but the sections which I examined appeared more\r\nlike a redeposited mass of this rock, with small pebbles and fragments\r\nof quartz. I shall immediately return to the important sections on the\r\nshores of Bahia Blanca. Twenty miles southward of this place, there is\r\na remarkable ridge extending W. by N. and E. by S., formed of small,\r\nseparate, flat-topped, steep-sided hills, rising between one hundred\r\nand two hundred feet above the Pampean plain at its southern base,\r\nwhich plain is a little lower than that to the north. The uppermost\r\nstratum in this ridge consists of pale, highly calcareous, compact\r\ntosca-rock, resting (as seen in one place) on reddish Pampean mud, and\r\nthis again on a paler kind: at the foot of the ridge, there is a well\r\nin reddish clay or mud. I have seen no other instance of a chain of\r\nhills belonging to the Pampean formation; and as the strata show no\r\nsigns of disturbance, and as the direction of the ridge is the same\r\nwith that common to all the metamorphic lines in this whole area, I\r\nsuspect that the Pampean sediment has in this instance been accumulated\r\non and over a ridge of hard rocks, instead of, as in the case of the\r\nabove-mentioned Sierras, round their submarine flanks. South of this\r\nlittle chain of tosca-rock, a plain of Pampean mud declines towards the\r\nbanks of the Colorado: in the middle a well has been dug in red Pampean\r\nmud, covered by two feet of white, softish, highly calcareous\r\ntosca-rock, over which lies sand with small pebbles three feet in\r\nthickness—the first appearance of that vast shingle formation described\r\nin the First Chapter. In the first section after crossing the Colorado,\r\nan old tertiary formation, namely, the Rio Negro sandstone (to be\r\ndescribed in the next chapter), is met with: but from the accounts\r\ngiven me by the Gauchos, I believe that at the mouth of the Colorado\r\nthe Pampean formation extends a little further southwards.\r\n\r\nBAHIA BLANCA.\r\n\r\nTo return to the shores of this bay. At Monte Hermoso there is a good\r\nsection, about one hundred feet in height, of four distinct strata,\r\nappearing to the eye horizontal, but thickening a little towards the\r\nN.W. The uppermost bed, about twenty feet in thickness, consists of\r\nobliquely laminated, soft sandstone, including many pebbles of quartz,\r\nand falling at the surface into loose sand. The second bed, only six\r\ninches thick, is a hard, dark-coloured sandstone. The third bed is\r\npale-coloured Pampean mud; and the fourth is of the same nature, but\r\ndarker coloured, including in its lower part horizontal layers and\r\nlines of concretions of not very compact pinkish tosca-rock. The bottom\r\nof the sea, I may remark, to a distance of several miles from the\r\nshore, and to a depth of between sixty and one hundred feet, was found\r\nby the anchors to be composed of tosca-rock and reddish Pampean mud.\r\nProfessor Ehrenberg has examined for me specimens of the two lower\r\nbeds, and finds in them three Polygastrica and six Phytolitharia.\r\n\r\n(The following list is given in the “Monatsberichten der konig. Akad.\r\nzu Berlin” April 1845:— POLYGASTRICA. Fragilaria rhabdosoma.\r\nGallionella distans. Pinnularia?\r\n\r\nPHYTOLITHARIA. Lithodontium Bursa. Lithodontium furcatum.\r\nLithostylidium exesum. Lithostylidium rude. Lithostylidium Serra.\r\nSpongolithis Fustis?)\r\n\r\nOf these, only one (Spongolithis Fustis?) is a marine form; five of\r\nthem are identical with microscopical structures of brackish-water\r\norigin, hereafter to be mentioned, which form a central point in the\r\nPampean formation. In these two beds, especially in the lower one,\r\nbones of extinct mammifers, some embedded in their proper relative\r\npositions and others single, are very numerous in a small extent of the\r\ncliffs. These remains consist of, first, the head of Ctenomys antiquus,\r\nallied to the living Ctenomys Braziliensis; secondly, a fragment of the\r\nremains of a rodent; thirdly, molar teeth and other bones of a large\r\nrodent, closely allied to, but distinct from, the existing species of\r\nHydrochoerus, and therefore probably an inhabitant of fresh water;\r\nfourth and fifthly, portions of vertebrae, limbs, ribs, and other bones\r\nof two rodents; sixthly, bones of the extremities of some great\r\nmegatheroid quadruped. (See “Fossil Mammalia” page 109 by Professor\r\nOwen, in the “Zoology of the Voyage of the ‘Beagle’;” and Catalogue\r\npage 36 of Fossil Remains in Museum of Royal College of Surgeons.) The\r\nnumber of the remains of rodents gives to this collection a peculiar\r\ncharacter, compared with those found in any other locality. All these\r\nbones are compact and heavy; many of them are stained red, with their\r\nsurfaces polished; some of the smaller ones are as black as jet.\r\n\r\nMonte Hermoso is between fifty and sixty miles distant in a S.E. line\r\nfrom the Ventana, with the intermediate country gently rising towards\r\nit, and all consisting of the Pampean formation. What relation, then,\r\ndo these beds, at the level of the sea and under it, bear to those on\r\nthe flanks of the Ventana, at the height of 840 feet, and on the flanks\r\nof the other neighbouring sierras, which, from the reasons already\r\nassigned, do not appear to owe their greater height to unequal\r\nelevation? When the tosca- rock was accumulating round the Ventana, and\r\nwhen, with the exception of a few small rugged primary islands, the\r\nwhole wide surrounding plains must have been under water, were the\r\nstrata at Monte Hermoso depositing at the bottom of a great open sea,\r\nbetween eight hundred and one thousand feet in depth? I much doubt\r\nthis; for if so, the almost perfect carcasses of the several small\r\nrodents, the remains of which are so very numerous in so limited a\r\nspace, must have been drifted to this spot from the distance of many\r\nhundred miles. It appears to me far more probable, that during the\r\nPampean period this whole area had commenced slowly rising (and in the\r\ncliffs, at several different heights we have proofs of the land having\r\nbeen exposed to sea-action at several levels), and that tracts of land\r\nhad thus been formed of Pampean sediment round the Ventana and the\r\nother primary ranges, on which the several rodents and other quadrupeds\r\nlived, and that a stream (in which perhaps the extinct aquatic\r\nHydrochoerus lived) drifted their bodies into the adjoining sea, into\r\nwhich the Pampean mud continued to be poured from the north. As the\r\nland continued to rise, it appears that this source of sediment was cut\r\noff; and in its place sand and pebbles were borne down by stronger\r\ncurrents, and conformably deposited over the Pampean strata.\r\n\r\n(FIGURE 15. SECTION OF BEDS WITH RECENT SHELLS AND EXTINCT MAMMIFERS,\r\nAT PUNTA ALTA IN BAHIA BLANCA. (Showing beds from bottom to top: A, B,\r\nC, D.))\r\n\r\nPunta Alta is situated about thirty miles higher up on the northern\r\nside of this same bay: it consists of a small plain, between twenty and\r\nthirty feet in height, cut off on the shore by a line of low cliffs\r\nabout a mile in length, represented in Figure 15 with its vertical\r\nscale necessarily exaggerated. The lower bed (A) is more extensive than\r\nthe upper ones; it consists of stratified gravel or conglomerate,\r\ncemented by calcareo- arenaceous matter, and is divided by curvilinear\r\nlayers of pinkish marl, of which some are precisely like tosca-rock,\r\nand some more sandy. The beds are curvilinear, owing to the action of\r\ncurrents, and dip in different directions; they include an\r\nextraordinary number of bones of gigantic mammifers and many shells.\r\nThe pebbles are of considerable size, and are of hard sandstone, and of\r\nquartz, like that of the Ventana: there are also a few well-rounded\r\nmasses of tosca-rock.\r\n\r\nThe second bed B is about fifteen feet in thickness, but towards both\r\nextremities of the cliff (not included in the diagram) it either thins\r\nout and dies away, or passes insensibly into an overlying bed of\r\ngravel. It consists of red, tough clayey mud, with minute linear\r\ncavities; it is marked with faint horizontal shades of colour; it\r\nincludes a few pebbles, and rarely a minute particle of shell: in one\r\nspot, the dermal armour and a few bones of a Dasypoid quadruped were\r\nembedded in it: it fills up furrows in the underlying gravel. With the\r\nexception of the few pebbles and particles of shells, this bed\r\nresembles the true Pampean mud; but it still more closely resembles the\r\nclayey flats (mentioned in the First Chapter) separating the\r\nsuccessively rising parallel ranges of sand-dunes.\r\n\r\nThe bed C is of stratified gravel, like the lowest one; it fills up\r\nfurrows in the underlying red mud, and is sometimes interstratified\r\nwith it, and sometimes insensibly passes into it; as the red mud thins\r\nout, this upper gravel thickens. Shells are more numerous in it than in\r\nthe lower gravel; but the bones, though some are still present, are\r\nless numerous. In one part, however, where this gravel and the red mud\r\npassed into each other, I found several bones and a tolerably perfect\r\nhead of the Megatherium. Some of the large Volutas, though embedded in\r\nthe gravel-bed C, were filled with the red mud, including great numbers\r\nof the little recent Paludestrina australis. These three lower beds are\r\ncovered by an unconformable mantle D of stratified sandy earth,\r\nincluding many pebbles of quartz, pumice and phonolite, land and\r\nsea-shells.\r\n\r\nM. d’Orbigny has been so obliging as to name for me the twenty species\r\nof Mollusca embedded in the two gravel beds: they consist of:—\r\n\r\n1. Volutella angulata, d’Orbigny, “Voyage” Mollusq. and Pal. 2. Voluta\r\nBraziliana, Sol 3. Olicancilleria Braziliensis d’Orbigny. 4.\r\nOlicancilleria auricularia, d’Orbigny. 5. Olivina puelchana, d’Orbigny.\r\n6. Buccinanops cochlidium, d’Orbigny. 7. Buccinanops globulosum,\r\nd’Orbigny. 8. Colombella sertulariarum, d’Orbigny. 9. Trochus\r\nPatagonicus, and var. of ditto, d’Orbigny. 10. Paludestrina Australis,\r\nd’Orbigny. 11. Fissurella Patagonica, d’Orbigny. 12. Crepidula\r\nmuricata, Lam. 13. Venus purpurata, Lam. 14. Venus rostrata, Phillippi.\r\n15. Mytilus Darwinianus, d’Orbigny. 16. Nucula semiornata, d’Orbigny.\r\n17. Cardita Patagonica, d’Orbigny. 18. Corbula Patagonica (?),\r\nd’Orbigny. 19. Pecten tethuelchus, d’Orbigny. 20. Ostrea puelchana,\r\nd’Orbigny. 21. A living species of Balanus. 22 and 23. An Astrae and\r\nencrusting Flustra, apparently identical with species now living in the\r\nbay.\r\n\r\nAll these shells now live on this coast, and most of them in this same\r\nbay. I was also struck with the fact, that the proportional numbers of\r\nthe different kinds appeared to be the same with those now cast up on\r\nthe beach: in both cases specimens of Voluta, Crepidula, Venus, and\r\nTrochus are the most abundant. Four or five of the species are the same\r\nwith the upraised shells on the Pampas near Buenos Ayres. All the\r\nspecimens have a very ancient and bleached appearance, and do not emit,\r\nwhen heated, an animal odour: some of them are changed throughout into\r\na white, soft, fibrous substance; others have the space between the\r\nexternal walls, either hollow, or filled up with crystalline carbonate\r\nof lime. (A Bulinus, mentioned in the Introduction to the “Fossil\r\nMammalia” in the “Zoology of the Voyage of the ‘Beagle’” has so much\r\nfresher an appearance, than the marine species, that I suspect it must\r\nhave fallen amongst the others, and been collected by mistake.)\r\n\r\nThe remains of the extinct mammiferous animals, from the two gravel\r\nbeds have been described by Professor Owen in the “Zoology of the\r\nVoyage of the ‘Beagle’:” they consist of, 1st, one nearly perfect head\r\nand three fragments of heads of the Megatherium Cuvierii; 2nd, a lower\r\njaw of Megalonyx Jeffersonii; 3rd, lower jaw of Mylodon Darwinii; 4th,\r\nfragments of a head of some gigantic Edental quadruped; 5th, an almost\r\nentire skeleton of the great Scelidotherium leptocephalum, with most of\r\nthe bones, including the head, vertebrae, ribs, some of the extremities\r\nto the claw- bone, and even, as remarked by Professor Owen, the\r\nknee-cap, all nearly in their proper relative positions; 6th, fragments\r\nof the jaw and a separate tooth of a Toxodon, belonging either to T.\r\nPlatensis, or to a second species lately discovered near Buenos Ayres;\r\n7th, a tooth of Equus curvidens; 8th, tooth of a Pachyderm, closely\r\nallied to Palaeotherium, of which parts of the head have been lately\r\nsent from Buenos Ayres to the British Museum; in all probability this\r\npachyderm is identical with the Macrauchenia Patagonica from Port S.\r\nJulian, hereafter to be referred to. Lastly, and 9thly, in a cliff of\r\nthe red clayey bed B, there was a double piece, about three feet long\r\nand two wide, of the bony armour of a large Dasypoid quadruped, with\r\nthe two sides pressed nearly close together: as the cliff is now\r\nrapidly washing away, this fossil probably was lately much more\r\nperfect; from between its doubled-up sides, I extracted the middle and\r\nungual phalanges, united together, of one of the feet, and likewise a\r\nseparate phalanx: hence one or more of the limbs must have been\r\nattached to the dermal case, when it was embedded. Besides these\r\nseveral remains in a distinguishable condition, there were very many\r\nsingle bones: the greater number were embedded in a space 200 yards\r\nsquare. The preponderance of the Edental quadrupeds is remarkable; as\r\nis, in contrast with the beds of Monte Hermoso, the absence of Rodents.\r\nMost of the bones are now in a soft and friable condition, and, like\r\nthe shells, do not emit when burnt an animal odour. The decayed state\r\nof the bones may be partly owing to their late exposure to the air and\r\ntidal-waves. Barnacles, Serpulae, and corallines are attached to many\r\nof the bones, but I neglected to observe whether these might not have\r\ngrown on them since being exposed to the present tidal action (After\r\nhaving packed up my specimens at Bahia Blanca, this point occurred to\r\nme, and I noted it; but forgot it on my return, until the remains had\r\nbeen cleaned and oiled: my attention has been lately called to the\r\nsubject by some remarks by M. d’Orbigny.); but I believe that some of\r\nthe barnacles must have grown on the Scelidotherium, soon after being\r\ndeposited, and before being WHOLLY covered up by the gravel. Besides\r\nthe remains in the condition here described, I found one single\r\nfragment of bone very much rolled, and as black as jet, so as perfectly\r\nto resemble some of the remains from Monte Hermoso.\r\n\r\nVery many of the bones had been broken, abraded, and rolled, before\r\nbeing embedded. Others, even some of those included in the coarsest\r\nparts of the the now hard conglomerate, still retain all their minutest\r\nprominences perfectly preserved; so that I conclude that they probably\r\nwere protected by skin, flesh, or ligaments, whilst being covered up.\r\nIn the case of the Scelidotherium, it is quite certain that the whole\r\nskeleton was held together by its ligaments, when deposited in the\r\ngravel in which I found it. Some cervical vertebrae and a humerus of\r\ncorresponding size lay so close together, as did some ribs and the\r\nbones of a leg, that I thought that they must originally have belonged\r\nto two skeletons, and not have been washed in single; but as remains\r\nwere here very numerous, I will not lay much stress on these two cases.\r\nWe have just seen that the armour of the Dasypoid quadruped was\r\ncertainly embedded together with some of the bones of the feet.\r\n\r\nProfessor Ehrenberg has examined for me specimens of the finer matter\r\nfrom in contact with these mammiferous remains: he finds in them two\r\nPolygastrica, decidedly marine forms; and six Phytolitharia, of which\r\none is probably marine, and the others either of fresh-water or\r\nterrestrial origin. (“Monatsberichten der Akad. zu Berlin” April 1845.\r\nThe list consists of:—\r\n\r\nPOLYGASTRICA. Gallionella sulcata. Stauroptera aspera? fragm.\r\n\r\nPHYTOLITHARIA. Lithasteriscus tuberculatus. Lithostylidium\r\nClepsammidium. Lithostylidium quadratum. Lithostylidium rude.\r\nLithostylidium unidentatum. Spongolithis acicularis.)\r\n\r\nOnly one of these eight microscopical bodies is common to the nine from\r\nMonte Hermoso: but five of them are in common with those from the\r\nPampean mud on the banks of the Parana. The presence of any fresh-water\r\ninfusoria, considering the aridity of the surrounding country, is here\r\nremarkable: the most probable explanation appears to be, that these\r\nmicroscopical organisms were washed out of the adjoining great Pampean\r\nformation during its denudation, and afterwards redeposited.\r\n\r\nWe will now see what conclusions may be drawn from the facts above\r\ndetailed. It is certain that the gravel-beds and intermediate red mud\r\nwere deposited within the period, when existing species of Mollusca\r\nheld to each other nearly the same relative proportions as they do on\r\nthe present coast. These beds, from the number of littoral species,\r\nmust have been accumulated in shallow water; but not, judging from the\r\nstratification of the gravel and the layers of marl, on a beach. From\r\nthe manner in which the red clay fills up furrows in the underlying\r\ngravel, and is in some parts itself furrowed by the overlying gravel,\r\nwhilst in other parts it either insensibly passes into, or alternates\r\nwith, this upper gravel, we may infer several local changes in the\r\ncurrents, perhaps caused by slight changes, up or down, in the level of\r\nthe land. By the elevation of these beds, to which period the alluvial\r\nmantle with pumice-pebbles, land and sea-shells belongs, the plain of\r\nPunta Alta, from twenty to thirty feet in height, was formed. In this\r\nneighbourhood there are other and higher sea-formed plains and lines of\r\ncliffs in the Pampean formation worn by the denuding action of the\r\nwaves at different levels. Hence we can easily understand the presence\r\nof rounded masses of tosca-rock in this lowest plain; and likewise, as\r\nthe cliffs at Monte Hermoso with their mammiferous remains stand at a\r\nhigher level, the presence of the one much-rolled fragment of bone\r\nwhich was as black as jet: possibly some few of the other much-rolled\r\nbones may have been similarly derived, though I saw only the one\r\nfragment, in the same condition with those from Monte Hermoso. M.\r\nd’Orbigny has suggested that all these mammiferous remains may have\r\nbeen washed out of the Pampean formation, and afterwards redeposited\r\ntogether with the recent shells. (“Voyage” Part. Geolog. page 49.)\r\nUndoubtedly it is a marvellous fact that these numerous gigantic\r\nquadrupeds, belonging, with the exception of the Equus curvidens, to\r\nseven extinct genera, and one, namely, the Toxodon, not falling into\r\nany existing family, should have co-existed with Mollusca, all of which\r\nare still living species; but analogous facts have been observed in\r\nNorth America and in Europe. In the first place, it should not be\r\noverlooked, that most of the co-embedded shells have a more ancient and\r\naltered appearance than the bones. In the second place, is it probable\r\nthat numerous bones not hardened by silex or any other mineral, could\r\nhave retained their delicate prominences and surfaces perfect if they\r\nhad been washed out of one deposit, and re-embedded in another:—this\r\nlater deposit being formed of large, hard pebbles, arranged by the\r\naction of currents or breakers in shallow water into variously curved\r\nand inclined layers? The bones which are now in so perfect a state of\r\npreservation, must, I conceive, have been fresh and sound when\r\nembedded, and probably were protected by skin, flesh, or ligaments. The\r\nskeleton of the Scelidotherium indisputably was deposited entire: shall\r\nwe say that when held together by its matrix it was washed out of an\r\nold gravel-bed (totally unlike in character to the Pampean formation),\r\nand re-embedded in another gravel-bed, composed (I speak after careful\r\ncomparison) of exactly the same kind of pebbles, in the same kind of\r\ncement? I will lay no stress on the two cases of several ribs and bones\r\nof the extremities having APPARENTLY been embedded in their proper\r\nrelative position: but will any one be so bold as to affirm that it is\r\npossible, that a piece of the thin tessellated armour of a Dasypoid\r\nquadruped, at least three feet long and two in width, and now so tender\r\nthat I was unable with the utmost care to extract a fragment more than\r\ntwo or three inches square, could have been washed out of one bed, and\r\nre-embedded in another, together with some of the small bones of the\r\nfeet, without having been dashed into atoms? We must then wholly reject\r\nM. d’Orbigny’s supposition, and admit as certain, that the\r\nScelidotherium and the large Dasypoid quadruped, and as highly\r\nprobable, that the Toxodon, Megatherium, etc., some of the bones of\r\nwhich are perfectly preserved, were embedded for the first time, and in\r\na fresh condition, in the strata in which they were found entombed.\r\nThese gigantic quadrupeds, therefore, though belonging to extinct\r\ngenera and families, coexisted with the twenty above-enumerated\r\nMollusca, the barnacle and two corals, still living on this coast. From\r\nthe rolled fragment of black bone, and from the plain of Punta Alta\r\nbeing lower than that of Monte Hermoso, I conclude that the coarse\r\nsub-littoral deposits of Punta Alta, are of subsequent origin to the\r\nPampean mud of Monte Hermoso; and the beds at this latter place, as we\r\nhave seen, are probably of subsequent origin to the high tosca-plain\r\nround the Sierra Ventana: we shall, however, return, at the end of this\r\nchapter, to the consideration of these several stages in the great\r\nPampean formation.\r\n\r\nBUENOS AYRES TO ST. FE BAJADA, IN ENTRE RIOS.\r\n\r\nFor some distance northward of Buenos Ayres, the escarpment of the\r\nPampean formation does not approach very near to the Plata, and it is\r\nconcealed by vegetation: but in sections on the banks of the Rios\r\nLuxan, Areco, and Arrecifes, I observed both pale and dark reddish\r\nPampean mud, with small, whitish concretions of tosca; at all these\r\nplaces mammiferous remains have been found. In the cliffs on the\r\nParana, at San Nicolas, the Pampean mud contains but little tosca; here\r\nM. d’Orbigny found the remains of two rodents (Ctenomys Bonariensis and\r\nKerodon antiquus) and the jaw of a Canis: when on the river I could\r\nclearly distinguish in this fine line of cliffs, “horizontal lines of\r\nvariation both in tint and compactness.” (I quote these words from my\r\nnote-book, as written down on the spot, on account of the general\r\nabsence of stratification in the Pampean formation having been insisted\r\non by M. d’Orbigny as a proof of the diluvial origin of this great\r\ndeposit.) The plain northward of this point is very level, but with\r\nsome depressions and lakes; I estimated its height at from forty to\r\nsixty feet above the Parana. At the A. Medio the bright red Pampean mud\r\ncontains scarcely any tosca-rock; whilst at a short distance the stream\r\nof the Pabon, forms a cascade, about twenty feet in height, over a\r\ncavernous mass of two varieties of tosca-rock; of which one is very\r\ncompact and semi- crystalline, with seams of crystallised carbonate of\r\nlime: similar compact varieties are met with on the Salidillo and Seco.\r\nThe absolute identity (I speak after a comparison of my specimens)\r\nbetween some of these varieties, and those from Tapalguen, and from the\r\nridge south of Bahia Blanca, a distance of 400 miles of latitude, is\r\nvery striking.\r\n\r\nAt Rosario there is but little tosca-rock: near this place I first\r\nnoticed at the edge of the river traces of an underlying formation,\r\nwhich, twenty- five miles higher up in the estancia of Gorodona,\r\nconsists of a pale yellowish clay, abounding with concretionary\r\ncylinders of a ferruginous sandstone. This bed, which is probably the\r\nequivalent of the older tertiary marine strata, immediately to be\r\ndescribed in Entre Rios, only just rises above the level of the Parana\r\nwhen low. The rest of the cliff at Gorodona, is formed of red Pampean\r\nmud, with, in the lower part, many concretions of tosca, some\r\nstalacti-formed, and with only a few in the upper part: at the height\r\nof six feet above the river, two gigantic skeletons of the Mastodon\r\nAndium were here embedded; their bones were scattered a few feet apart,\r\nbut many of them still held their proper relative positions: they were\r\nmuch decayed and as soft as cheese, so that even one of the great molar\r\nteeth fell into pieces in my hand. We here see that the Pampean deposit\r\ncontains mammiferous remains close to its base. On the banks of the\r\nCarcarana, a few miles distant, the lowest bed visible was pale Pampean\r\nmud, with masses of tosca-rock, in one of which I found a much decayed\r\ntooth of the Mastodon: above this bed, there was a thin layer almost\r\ncomposed of small concretions of white tosca, out of which I extracted\r\na well preserved, but slightly broken tooth of Toxodon Platensis: above\r\nthis there was an unusual bed of very soft impure sandstone. In this\r\nneighbourhood I noticed many single embedded bones, and I heard of\r\nothers having been found in so perfect a state that they were long used\r\nas gate-posts: the Jesuit Falkner found here the dermal armour of some\r\ngigantic Edental quadruped.\r\n\r\nIn some of the red mud scraped from a tooth of one of the Mastodons at\r\nGorodona, Professor Ehrenberg finds seven Polygastrica and thirteen\r\nPhytolitharia, all of them, I believe, with two exceptions, already\r\nknown species. (“Monatsberichten der konig. Akad. zu Berlin” April\r\n1845. The list consists of:—\r\n\r\nPOLYGASTRICA. Campylodiscus clypeus. Coscinodiscus subtilis.\r\nCoscinodiscus al. sp. Eunotia. Gallionella granulata. Himantidium\r\ngracile. Pinnularia borealis.)\r\n\r\nOf these twenty, the preponderating number are of fresh-water origin;\r\nonly two species of Coscinodiscus and a Spongolithis show the direct\r\ninfluence of the sea; therefore Professor Ehrenberg arrives at the\r\nimportant conclusion that the deposit must have been of brackish-water\r\norigin. Of the thirteen Phytolitharia, nine are met with in the two\r\ndeposits in Bahia Blanca, where there is evidence from two other\r\nspecies of Polygastrica that the beds were accumulated in brackish\r\nwater. The traces of coral, sponges, and Polythalamia, found by Dr.\r\nCarpenter in the tosca-rock (of which I must observe the greater number\r\nof specimens were from the upper beds in the southern parts of the\r\nformation), apparently show a more purely marine origin.\r\n\r\nAt ST. FE BAJADA, in Entre Rios, the cliffs, estimated at between sixty\r\nand seventy feet in height, expose an interesting section: the lower\r\nhalf consists of tertiary strata with marine shells, and the upper half\r\nof the Pampean formation. The lowest bed is an obliquely laminated,\r\nblackish, indurated mud, with distinct traces of vegetable remains. (M.\r\nd’Orbigny “Voyage” Part. Geolog. page 37, has given a detailed\r\ndescription of this section, but as he does not mention this lowest\r\nbed, it may have been concealed when he was there by the river. There\r\nis a considerable discrepancy between his description and mine, which I\r\ncan only account for by the beds themselves varying considerably in\r\nshort distances.) Above this there is a thick bed of yellowish sandy\r\nclay, with much crystallised gypsum and many shells of Ostreae,\r\nPectens, and Arcae: above this there generally comes an arenaceous\r\ncrystalline limestone, but there is sometimes interposed a bed, about\r\ntwelve feet thick, of dark green, soapy clay, weathering into small\r\nangular fragments. The limestone, where purest, is white, highly\r\ncrystalline, and full of cavities: it includes small pebbles of quartz,\r\nbroken shells, teeth of sharks, and sometimes, as I was informed, large\r\nbones: it often contains so much sand as to pass into a calcareous\r\nsandstone, and in such parts the great Ostrea Patagonica chiefly\r\nabounds. (Captain Sulivan, R.N., has given me a specimen of this shell,\r\nwhich he found in the cliffs at Point Cerrito, between twenty and\r\nthirty miles above the Bajada.) In the upper part, the limestone\r\nalternates with layers of fine white sand. The shells included in these\r\nbeds have been named for me by M. d’Orbigny: they consist of:—\r\n\r\n1. Ostrea Patagonica, d’Orbigny, “Voyage” Part. Pal. 2. Ostrea\r\nAlvarezii, d’Orbigny, “Voyage” Part. Pal. 3. Pecten Paranensis,\r\nd’Orbigny, “Voyage” Part. Pal. 4. Pecten Darwinianus, d’Orbigny,\r\n“Voyage” Part. Pal. 5. Venus Munsterii, d’Orbigny, “Voyage” Pal. 6.\r\nArca Bonplandiana, d’Orbigny, “Voyage” Pal. 7. Cardium Platense,\r\nd’Orbigny, “Voyage” Pal. 8. Tellina, probably nov. species, but too\r\nimperfect for description.\r\n\r\nPHYTOLITHARIA.\r\n\r\nLithasteriscus tuberculatus. Lithodontium bursa. Lithodontium furcatum.\r\nLithodontium rostratum. Lithostylidium Amphiodon. Lithostylidium\r\nClepsammidium. Lithostylidium Hamus. Lithostylidium polyedrum.\r\nLithostylidium quadratum. Lithostylidium rude. Lithostylidium Serra.\r\nLithostylidium unidentatum. Spongolithis Fustis.\r\n\r\nThese species are all extinct: the six first were found by M. d’Orbigny\r\nand myself in the formations of the Rio Negro, S. Josef, and other\r\nparts of Patagonia; and therefore, as first observed by M. d’Orbigny,\r\nthese beds certainly belong to the great Patagonian formation, which\r\nwill be described in the ensuing chapter, and which we shall see must\r\nbe considered as a very ancient tertiary one. North of the Bajada, M.\r\nd’Orbigny found, in beds which he considers as lying beneath the strata\r\nhere described, remains of a Toxodon, which he has named as a distinct\r\nspecies from the T. Platensis of the Pampean formation. Much silicified\r\nwood is found on the banks of the Parana (and likewise on the Uruguay),\r\nand I was informed that they come out of these lower beds; four\r\nspecimens collected by myself are dicotyledonous.\r\n\r\nThe upper half of the cliff, to a thickness of about thirty feet,\r\nconsists of Pampean mud, of which the lower part is pale-coloured, and\r\nthe upper part of a brighter red, with some irregular layers of an\r\narenaceous variety of tosca, and a few small concretions of the\r\nordinary kind. Close above the marine limestone, there is a thin\r\nstratum with a concretionary outline of white hard tosca-rock or marl,\r\nwhich may be considered either as the uppermost bed of the inferior\r\ndeposits, or the lowest of the Pampean formation; at one time I\r\nconsidered this bed as marking a passage between the two formations:\r\nbut I have since become convinced that I was deceived on this point. In\r\nthe section on the Parana, I did not find any mammiferous remains; but\r\nat two miles distance on the A. Tapas (a tributary of the Conchitas),\r\nthey were extremely numerous in a low cliff of red Pampean mud with\r\nsmall concretions, precisely like the upper bed on the Parana. Most of\r\nthe bones were solitary and much decayed; but I saw the dermal armour\r\nof a gigantic Edental quadruped, forming a caldron-like hollow, four or\r\nfive feet in diameter, out of which, as I was informed, the almost\r\nentire skeleton had been lately removed. I found single teeth of the\r\nMastodon Andium, Toxodon Platensis, and Equus curvidens, near to each\r\nother. As this latter tooth approaches closely to that of the common\r\nhorse, I paid particular attention to its true embedment, for I did not\r\nat that time know that there was a similar tooth hidden in the matrix\r\nwith the other mammiferous remains from Punta Alta. It is an\r\ninteresting circumstance, that Professor Owen finds that the teeth of\r\nthis horse approach more closely in their peculiar curvature to a\r\nfossil specimen brought by Mr. Lyell from North America, than to those\r\nof any other species of Equus. (Lyell “Travels in North America” volume\r\n1 page 164 and “Proceedings of Geological Society” volume 4 page 39.)\r\n\r\nThe underlying marine tertiary strata extend over a wide area: I was\r\nassured that they can be traced in ravines in an east and west line\r\nacross Entre Rios to the Uruguay, a distance of about 135 miles. In a\r\nS.E. direction I heard of their existence at the head of the R. Nankay;\r\nand at P. Gorda in Banda Oriental, a distance of 170 miles, I found the\r\nsame limestone, containing the same fossil shells, lying at about the\r\nsame level above the river as at St. Fe. In a southerly direction,\r\nthese beds sink in height, for at another P. Gorda in Entre Rios, the\r\nlimestone is seen at a much less height; and there can be little doubt\r\nthat the yellowish sandy clay, on a level with the river, between the\r\nCarcarana and S. Nicholas, belongs to this same formation; as perhaps\r\ndo the beds of sand at Buenos Ayres, which lie at the bottom of the\r\nPampean formation, about sixty feet beneath the surface of the Plata.\r\nThe southerly declination of these beds may perhaps be due, not to\r\nunequal elevation, but to the original form of the bottom of the sea,\r\nsloping from land situated to the north; for that land existed at no\r\ngreat distance, we have evidence in the vegetable remains in the lowest\r\nbed at St. Fe; and in the silicified wood and in the bones of Toxodon\r\nParanensis, found (according to M. d’Orbigny) in still lower strata.\r\n\r\nBANDA ORIENTAL.\r\n\r\nThis province lies on the northern side of the Plata, and eastward of\r\nthe Uruguay: it has a gentle undulatory surface, with a basis of\r\nprimary rocks; and is in most parts covered up with an unstratified\r\nmass, of no great thickness, of reddish Pampean mud. In the eastern\r\nhalf, near Maldonado, this deposit is more arenaceous than in the\r\nPampas, it contains many though small concretions of marl or\r\ntosca-rock, and others of highly ferruginous sandstone; in one section,\r\nonly a few yards in depth, it rested on stratified sand. Near Monte\r\nVideo this deposit in some spots appears to be of greater thickness;\r\nand the remains of the Glyptodon and other extinct mammifers have been\r\nfound in it. In the long line of cliffs, between fifty and sixty feet\r\nin height, called the Barrancas de S. Gregorio, which extend westward\r\nof the Rio S. Lucia, the lower half is formed of coarse sand of quartz\r\nand feldspar without mica, like that now cast up on the beach near\r\nMaldonado; and the upper half of Pampean mud, varying in colour and\r\ncontaining honeycombed veins of soft calcareous matter and small\r\nconcretions of tosca-rock arranged in lines, and likewise a few pebbles\r\nof quartz. This deposit fills up hollows and furrows in the underlying\r\nsand; appearing as if water charged with mud had invaded a sandy beach.\r\nThese cliffs extend far westward, and at a distance of sixty miles,\r\nnear Colonia del Sacramiento, I found the Pampean deposit resting in\r\nsome places on this sand, and in others on the primary rocks: between\r\nthe sand and the reddish mud, there appeared to be interposed, but the\r\nsection was not a very good one, a thin bed of shells of an existing\r\nMytilus, still partially retaining their colour. The Pampean formation\r\nin Banda Oriental might readily be mistaken for an alluvial deposit:\r\ncompared with that of the Pampas, it is often more sandy, and contains\r\nsmall fragments of quartz; the concretions are much smaller, and there\r\nare no extensive masses of tosca-rock.\r\n\r\nIn the extreme western parts of this province, between the Uruguay and\r\na line drawn from Colonia to the R. Perdido (a tributary of the R.\r\nNegro), the formations are far more complicated. Besides primary rocks,\r\nwe meet with extensive tracts and many flat-topped, horizontally\r\nstratified, cliff- bounded, isolated hills of tertiary strata, varying\r\nextraordinarily in mineralogical nature, some identical with the old\r\nmarine beds of St. Fe Bajada, and some with those of the much more\r\nrecent Pampean formation. There are, also, extensive LOW tracts of\r\ncountry covered with a deposit containing mammiferous remains,\r\nprecisely like that just described in the more eastern parts of the\r\nprovince. Although from the smooth and unbroken state of the country, I\r\nnever obtained a section of this latter deposit close to the foot of\r\nthe higher tertiary hills, yet I have not the least doubt that it is of\r\nquite subsequent origin; having been deposited after the sea had worn\r\nthe tertiary strata into the cliff-bounded hills. This later formation,\r\nwhich is certainly the equivalent of that of the Pampas, is well seen\r\nin the valleys in the estancia of Berquelo, near Mercedes; it here\r\nconsists of reddish earth, full of rounded grains of quartz, and with\r\nsome small concretions of tosca-rock arranged in horizontal lines, so\r\nas perfectly to resemble, except in containing a little calcareous\r\nmatter, the formation in the eastern parts of Banda Oriental, in Entre\r\nRios, and at other places: in this estancia the skeleton of a great\r\nEdental quadruped was found. In the valley of the Sarandis, at the\r\ndistance of only a few miles, this deposit has a somewhat different\r\ncharacter, being whiter, softer, finer-grained, and full of little\r\ncavities, and consequently of little specific gravity; nor does it\r\ncontain any concretions or calcareous matter: I here procured a head,\r\nwhich when first discovered must have been quite perfect, of the\r\nToxodon Platensis, another of a Mylodon (This head was at first\r\nconsidered by Professor Owen (in the “Zoology of the ‘Beagle’s’\r\nVoyage”) as belonging to a distinct genus, namely, Glossotherium.),\r\nperhaps M. Darwinii, and a large piece of dermal armour, differing from\r\nthat of the Glyptodon clavipes. These bones are remarkable from their\r\nextraordinarily fresh appearance; when held over a lamp of spirits of\r\nwine, they give out a strong odour and burn with a small flame; Mr. T.\r\nReeks has been so kind as to analyse some of the fragments, and he\r\nfinds that they contain about 7 per cent of animal matter, and 8 per\r\ncent of water. (Liebig “Chemistry of Agriculture” page 194 states that\r\nfresh dry bones contain from 32 to 33 per cent of dry gelatine. See\r\nalso Dr. Daubeny, in “Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal” volume 37\r\npage 293.)\r\n\r\nThe older tertiary strata, forming the higher isolated hills and\r\nextensive tracts of country, vary, as I have said, extraordinarily in\r\ncomposition: within the distance of a few miles, I sometimes passed\r\nover crystalline limestone with agate, calcareous tuffs, and marly\r\nrocks, all passing into each other,—red and pale mud with concretions\r\nof tosca-rock, quite like the Pampean formation,—calcareous\r\nconglomerates and sandstones,—bright red sandstones passing either into\r\nred conglomerate, or into white sandstone,—hard siliceous sandstones,\r\njaspery and chalcedonic rocks, and numerous other subordinate\r\nvarieties. I was unable to mark out the relations of all these strata,\r\nand will describe only a few distinct sections:—in the cliffs between\r\nP. Gorda on the Uruguay and the A. de Vivoras, the upper bed is\r\ncrystalline cellular limestone often passing into calcareous sandstone,\r\nwith impressions of some of the same shells as at St. Fe Bajada; at P.\r\nGorda, this limestone is interstratified with and rests on, white sand,\r\nwhich covers a bed about thirty feet thick of pale-coloured clay, with\r\nmany shells of the great Ostrea Patagonica (In my “Journal” page 171\r\n1st edition, I have hastily and inaccurately stated that the Pampean\r\nmud, which is found over the eastern part of B. Oriental, lies OVER the\r\nlimestone at P. Gorda; I should have said that there was reason to\r\ninfer that it was a subsequent or superior deposit.): beneath this, in\r\nthe vertical cliff, nearly on a level with the river, there is a bed of\r\nred mud absolutely like the Pampean deposit, with numerous often large\r\nconcretions of perfectly characterised white, compact tosca-rock. At\r\nthe mouth of the Vivoras, the river flows over a pale cavernous\r\ntosca-rock, quite like that in the Pampas, and this APPEARED to\r\nunderlie the crystalline limestone; but the section was not unequivocal\r\nlike that at P. Gorda. These beds now form only a narrow and much\r\ndenuded strip of land; but they must once have extended much further;\r\nfor on the next stream, south of the S. Juan, Captain Sulivan, R.N.,\r\nfound a little cliff, only just above the surface of the river, with\r\nnumerous shells of the Venus Munsterii, D’Orbigny,—one of the species\r\noccurring at St. Fe, and of which there are casts at P. Gorda: the line\r\nof cliffs of the subsequently deposited true Pampean mud, extend from\r\nColonia to within half a mile of this spot, and no doubt once covered\r\nup this denuded marine stratum. Again at Colonia, a Frenchman found, in\r\ndigging the foundations of a house, a great mass of the Ostrea\r\nPatagonica (of which I saw many fragments), packed together just\r\nbeneath the surface, and directly superimposed on the gneiss. These\r\nsections are important: M. d’Orbigny is unwilling to believe that beds\r\nof the same nature with the Pampean formation ever underlie the ancient\r\nmarine tertiary strata; and I was as much surprised at it as he could\r\nhave been; but the vertical cliff at P. Gorda allowed of no mistake,\r\nand I must be permitted to affirm, that after having examined the\r\ncountry from the Colorado to St. Fe Bajada, I could not be deceived in\r\nthe mineralogical character of the Pampean deposit.\r\n\r\nMoreover, in a precipitous part of the ravine of Las Bocas, a red\r\nsandstone is distinctly seen to overlie a thick bed of pale mud, also\r\nquite like the Pampean formation, abounding with concretions of true\r\ntosca-rock. This sandstone extends over many miles of country: it is as\r\nred as the brightest volcanic scoriae; it sometimes passes into a\r\ncoarse red conglomerate composed of the underlying primary rocks; and\r\noften passes into a soft white sandstone with red streaks. At the\r\nCalera de los Huerfanos, only a quarter of a mile south of where I\r\nfirst met with the red sandstone, the crystalline white limestone is\r\nquarried: as this bed is the uppermost, and as it often passes into\r\ncalcareous sandstone, interstratified with pure sand; and as the red\r\nsandstone likewise passes into soft white sandstone, and is also the\r\nuppermost bed, I believe that these two beds, though so different, are\r\nequivalents. A few leagues southward of these two places, on each side\r\nof the low primary range of S. Juan, there are some flat-topped,\r\ncliff-bounded, separate little hills, very similar to those fringing\r\nthe primary ranges in the great plain south of Buenos Ayres: they are\r\ncomposed—1st, of calcareous tuff with many particles of quartz,\r\nsometimes passing into a coarse conglomerate; 2nd, of a stone\r\nundistinguishable on the closest inspection from the compacter\r\nvarieties of tosca-rock; and 3rd, of semi-crystalline limestone,\r\nincluding nodules of agate: these three varieties pass insensibly into\r\neach other, and as they form the uppermost stratum in this district, I\r\nbelieve that they, also, are the equivalents of the pure crystalline\r\nlimestone, and of the red and white sandstones and conglomerates.\r\n\r\nBetween these points and Mercedes on the Rio Negro, there are scarcely\r\nany good sections, the road passing over limestone, tosca-rock,\r\ncalcareous and bright red sandstones, and near the source of the San\r\nSalvador over a wide extent of jaspery rocks, with much milky agate,\r\nlike that in the limestone near San Juan. In the estancia of Berquelo,\r\nthe separate, flat-topped, cliff-bounded hills are rather higher than\r\nin the other parts of the country; they range in a N.E. and S.W.\r\ndirection; their uppermost beds consist of the same bright red\r\nsandstone, passing sometimes into a conglomerate, and in the lower part\r\ninto soft white sandstone, and even into loose sand: beneath this\r\nsandstone, I saw in two places layers of calcareous and marly rocks,\r\nand in one place red Pampean-like earth; at the base of these sections,\r\nthere was a hard, stratified, white sandstone, with chalcedonic layers.\r\nNear Mercedes, beds of the same nature and apparently of the same age,\r\nare associated with compact, white, crystalline limestone, including\r\nmuch botryoidal agate, and singular masses, like porcelain, but really\r\ncomposed of a calcareo-siliceous paste. In sinking wells in this\r\ndistrict the chalcedonic strata seem to be the lowest. Beds, such as\r\nthere described, occur over the whole of this neighbourhood; but twenty\r\nmiles further up the R. Negro, in the cliffs of Perika, which are about\r\nfifty feet in height, the upper bed is a prettily variegated\r\nchalcedony, mingled with a pure white tallowy limestone; beneath this\r\nthere is a conglomerate of quartz and granite; beneath this many\r\nsandstones, some highly calcareous; and the whole lower two-thirds of\r\nthe cliff consists of earthy calcareous beds of various degrees of\r\npurity, with one layer of reddish Pampean-like mud.\r\n\r\nWhen examining the agates, the chalcedonic and jaspery rocks, some of\r\nthe limestones, and even the bright red sandstones, I was forcibly\r\nstruck with their resemblance to deposits formed in the neighbourhood\r\nof volcanic action. I now find that M. Isabelle, in his “Voyage a\r\nBuenos Ayres,” has described closely similar beds on Itaquy and Ibicuy\r\n(which enter the Uruguay some way north of the R. Negro) and these beds\r\ninclude fragments of red decomposed true scoriae hardened by zeolite,\r\nand of black retinite: we have then here good evidence of volcanic\r\naction during our tertiary period. Still further north, near S. Anna,\r\nwhere the Parana makes a remarkable bend, M. Bonpland found some\r\nsingular amygdaloidal rocks, which perhaps may belong to this same\r\nepoch. (M. d’Orbigny “Voyage” Part. Geolog. page 29) I may remark that,\r\njudging from the size and well-rounded condition of the blocks of rock\r\nin the above-described conglomerates, masses of primary formation\r\nprobably existed at this tertiary period above water: there is, also,\r\naccording to M. Isabelle, much conglomerate further north, at Salto.\r\n\r\nFrom whatever source and through whatever means the great Pampean\r\nformation originated, we here have, I must repeat, unequivocal evidence\r\nof a similar action at a period before that of the deposition of the\r\nmarine tertiary strata with extinct shells, at Santa Fe and P. Gorda.\r\nDuring also the deposition of these strata, we have in the intercalated\r\nlayers of red Pampean-like mud and tosca-rock, and in the passage near\r\nS. Juan of the semi-crystalline limestones with agate into tosca\r\nundistinguishable from that of the Pampas, evidence of the same action,\r\nthough continued only at intervals and in a feeble manner. We have\r\nfurther seen that in this district, at a period not only subsequent to\r\nthe deposition of the tertiary strata, but to their upheavement and\r\nmost extensive denudation, true Pampean mud with its usual characters\r\nand including mammiferous remains, was deposited round and between the\r\nhills or islets formed of these tertiary strata, and over the whole\r\neastern and low primary districts of Banda Oriental.\r\n\r\nEARTHY MASS, WITH EXTINCT MAMMIFEROUS REMAINS, OVER THE PORPHYRITIC\r\nGRAVEL AT S. JULIAN, LATITUDE 49 DEGREES 14′ S., IN PATAGONIA.\r\n\r\n(FIGURE 16. SECTION OF THE LOWEST PLAIN AT PORT S. JULIAN.\r\n\r\n(Section through beds from top to bottom: A, B, C, D, E, F.)\r\n\r\nAA. Superficial bed of reddish earth, with the remains of the\r\nMacrauchenia, and with recent sea-shells on the surface.\r\n\r\nB. Gravel of porphyritic rocks.\r\n\r\nC. and D. Pumiceous mudstone.—Ancient tertiary formation.\r\n\r\nE. and F. Sandstone and argillaceous beds.—Ancient tertiary formation.)\r\n\r\nThis case, though not coming strictly under the Pampean formation, may\r\nbe conveniently given here. On the south side of the harbour, there is\r\na nearly level plain (mentioned in the First Chapter) about seven miles\r\nlong, and three or four miles wide, estimated at ninety feet in height,\r\nand bordered by perpendicular cliffs, of which a section is represented\r\nin Figure 16.\r\n\r\nThe lower old tertiary strata (to be described in the next chapter) are\r\ncovered by the usual gravel bed; and this by an irregular earthy,\r\nsometimes sandy mass, seldom more than two or three feet in thickness,\r\nexcept where it fills up furrows or gullies worn not only through the\r\nunderlying gravel, but even through the upper tertiary beds. This\r\nearthy mass is of a pale reddish colour, like the less pure varieties\r\nof Pampean mud in Banda Oriental; it includes small calcareous\r\nconcretions, like those of tosca- rock but more arenaceous, and other\r\nconcretions of a greenish, indurated argillaceous substance: a few\r\npebbles, also, from the underlying gravel-bed are also included in it,\r\nand these being occasionally arranged in horizontal lines, show that\r\nthe mass is of sub-aqueous origin. On the surface and embedded in the\r\nsuperficial parts, there are numerous shells, partially retaining their\r\ncolours, of three or four of the now commonest littoral species. Near\r\nthe bottom of one deep furrow (represented in Figure 16), filled up\r\nwith this earthy deposit, I found a large part of the skeleton of the\r\nMacrauchenia Patachonica—a gigantic and most extraordinary pachyderm,\r\nallied, according to Professor Owen, to the Palaeotherium, but with\r\naffinities to the Ruminants, especially to the American division of the\r\nCamelidae. Several of the vertebrae in a chain, and nearly all the\r\nbones of one of the limbs, even to the smallest bones of the foot, were\r\nembedded in their proper relative positions: hence the skeleton was\r\ncertainly united by its flesh or ligaments, when enveloped in the mud.\r\nThis earthy mass, with its concretions and mammiferous remains, filling\r\nup furrows in the underlying gravel, certainly presents a very striking\r\nresemblance to some of the sections (for instance, at P. Alta in B.\r\nBlanca, or at the Barrancas de S. Gregorio) in the Pampean formation;\r\nbut I must believe that this resemblance is only accidental. I suspect\r\nthat the mud which at the present day is accumulating in deep and\r\nnarrow gullies at the head of the harbour, would, after elevation,\r\npresent a very similar appearance. The southernmost part of the true\r\nPampean formation, namely, on the Colorado, lies 560 miles of latitude\r\nnorth of this point. (In the succeeding chapter I shall have to refer\r\nto a great deposit of extinct mammiferous remains, lately discovered by\r\nCaptain Sulivan, R.N., at a point still further south, namely, at the\r\nR. Gallegos; their age must at present remain doubtful.)\r\n\r\nWith respect to the age of the Macrauchenia, the shells on the surface\r\nprove that the mass in which the skeleton was enveloped has been\r\nelevated above the sea within the recent period: I did not see any of\r\nthe shells embedded at a sufficient depth to assure me (though it be\r\nhighly probable) that the whole thickness of the mass was\r\ncontemporaneous with these INDIVIDUAL SPECIMENS. That the Macrauchenia\r\nlived subsequently to the spreading out of the gravel on this plain is\r\ncertain; and that this gravel, at the height of ninety feet, was spread\r\nout long after the existence of recent shells, is scarcely less\r\ncertain. For, it was shown in the First Chapter, that this line of\r\ncoast has been upheaved with remarkable equability, and that over a\r\nvast space both north and south of S. Julian, recent species of shells\r\nare strewed on (or embedded in) the surface of the 250 feet plain, and\r\nof the 350 feet plain up to a height of 400 feet. These wide\r\nstep-formed plains have been formed by the denuding action of the\r\ncoast-waves on the old tertiary strata; and therefore, when the surface\r\nof the 350 feet plain, with the shells on it, first rose above the\r\nlevel of the sea, the 250 feet plain did not exist, and its formation,\r\nas well as the spreading out of the gravel on its summit, must have\r\ntaken place subsequently. So also the denudation and the\r\ngravel-covering of the 90 feet plain must have taken place subsequently\r\nto the elevation of the 250 feet plain, on which recent shells are also\r\nstrewed. Hence there cannot be any doubt that the Macrauchenia, which\r\ncertainly was entombed in a fresh state, and which must have been alive\r\nafter the spreading out of the gravel on the 90 feet plain, existed,\r\nnot only subsequently to the upraised shells on the surface of the 250\r\nfeet plain, but also to those on the 350 to 400 feet plain: these\r\nshells, eight in number (namely, three species of Mytilus, two of\r\nPatella, one Fusus, Voluta, and Balanus), are undoubtedly recent\r\nspecies, and are the commonest kinds now living on this coast. At Punta\r\nAlta in B. Blanca, I remarked how marvellous it was, that the Toxodon,\r\na mammifer so unlike to all known genera, should have co-existed with\r\ntwenty- three still living marine animals; and now we find that the\r\nMacrauchenia, a quadruped only a little less anomalous than the\r\nToxodon, also co-existed with eight other still existing Mollusca: it\r\nshould, moreover, be borne in mind, that a tooth of a pachydermatous\r\nanimal was found with the other remains at Punta Alta, which Professor\r\nOwen thinks almost certainly belonged to the Macrauchenia.\r\n\r\nMr. Lyell has arrived at a highly important conclusion with respect to\r\nthe age of the North American extinct mammifers (many of which are\r\nclosely allied to, and even identical with, those of the Pampean\r\nformation), namely, that they lived subsequently to the period when\r\nerratic boulders were transported by the agency of floating ice in\r\ntemperate latitudes. (“Geological Proceedings” volume 4 page 36.) Now\r\nin the valley of the Santa Cruz, only fifty miles of latitude south of\r\nthe spot where the Macrauchenia was entombed, vast numbers of gigantic,\r\nangular boulders, which must have been transported from the Cordillera\r\non icebergs, lie strewed on the plain, at the height of 1,400 feet\r\nabove the level of the sea. In ascending to this level, several\r\nstep-formed plains must be crossed, all of which have necessarily\r\nrequired long time for their formation; hence the lowest or ninety feet\r\nplain, with its superficial bed containing the remains of the\r\nMacrauchenia, must have been formed very long subsequently to the\r\nperiod when the 1,400 feet plain was beneath the sea, and boulders were\r\ndropped on it from floating masses of ice. (It must not be inferred\r\nfrom these remarks, that the ice-action ceased in South America at this\r\ncomparatively ancient period; for in Tierra del Fuego boulders were\r\nprobably transported contemporaneously with, if not subsequently to,\r\nthe formation of the ninety feet plain at S. Julian, and at other parts\r\nof the coast of Patagonia.) Mr. Lyell’s conclusion, therefore, is thus\r\nfar confirmed in the southern hemisphere; and it is the more important,\r\nas one is naturally tempted to admit so simple an explanation, that it\r\nwas the ice-period that caused the extinction of the numerous great\r\nmammifers which so lately swarmed over the two Americas.\r\n\r\nA SUMMARY AND CONCLUDING REMARKS ON THE PAMPEAN FORMATION.\r\n\r\nOne of its most striking features is its great extent; I passed\r\ncontinuously over it from the Colorado to St. Fe Bajada, a distance of\r\n500 geographical miles; and M. d’Orbigny traced it for 250 miles\r\nfurther north. In the latitude of the Plata, I examined this formation\r\nat intervals over an east and west line of 300 miles from Maldonado to\r\nthe R. Carcarana; and M. d’Orbigny believes it extends 100 miles\r\nfurther inland: from Mr. Caldcleugh’s travels, however, I should have\r\nthought that it had extended, south of the Cordovese range, to near\r\nMendoza, and I may add that I heard of great bones having been found\r\nhigh up the R. Quinto. Hence the area of the Pampean formation, as\r\nremarked by M. d’Orbigny, is probably at least equal to that of France,\r\nand perhaps twice or thrice as great. In a basin, surrounded by\r\ngravel-cliff (at a height of nearly three thousand feet), south of\r\nMendoza, there is, as described in the Third Chapter, a deposit very\r\nlike the Pampean, interstratified with other matter; and again at S.\r\nJulian’s, in Patagonia, 560 miles south of the Colorado, a small\r\nirregular bed of a nearly similar nature contains, as we have just\r\nseen, mammiferous remains. In the provinces of Moxos and Chiquitos\r\n(1,000 miles northward of the Pampas), and in Bolivia, at a height of\r\n4,000 metres, M. d’Orbigny has described similar deposits, which he\r\nbelieves to have been formed by the same agency contemporaneously with\r\nthe Pampean formation. Considering the immense distances between these\r\nseveral points, and their different heights, it appears to me\r\ninfinitely more probable, that this similarity has resulted not from\r\ncontemporaneousness of origin, but from the similarity of the rocky\r\nframework of the continent: it is known that in Brazil an immense area\r\nconsists of gneissic rocks, and we shall hereafter see, over how great\r\na length the plutonic rocks of the Cordillera, the overlying purple\r\nporphyries, and the trachytic ejections, are almost identical in\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nThree theories on the origin of the Pampean formation have been\r\npropounded:—First, that of a great debacle by M. d’Orbigny; this seems\r\nfounded chiefly on the absence of stratification, and on the number of\r\nembedded remains of terrestrial quadrupeds. Although the Pampean\r\nformation (like so many argillaceous deposits) is not divided into\r\ndistinct and separate strata, yet we have seen that in one good section\r\nit was striped with horizontal zones of colour, and that in several\r\nspecified places the upper and lower parts differed, not only\r\nconsiderably in colour, but greatly in constitution. In the southern\r\npart of the Pampas the upper mass (to a certain extent stratified)\r\ngenerally consists of hard tosca-rock, and the lower part of red\r\nPampean mud, often itself divided into two or more masses, varying in\r\ncolour and in the quantity of included calcareous matter. In Western\r\nBanda Oriental, beds of a similar nature, but of a greater age,\r\nconformably underlie and are intercalated with the regularly stratified\r\ntertiary formation. As a general rule, the marly concretions are\r\narranged in horizontal lines, sometimes united into irregular strata:\r\nsurely, if the mud had been tumultuously deposited in mass, the\r\nincluded calcareous matter would have segregated itself irregularly,\r\nand not into nodules arranged in horizontal lines, one above the other\r\nand often far apart: this arrangement appears to me to prove that mud,\r\ndiffering slightly in composition, was successively and quietly\r\ndeposited. On the theory of a debacle, a prodigious amount of mud,\r\nwithout a single pebble, is supposed to have been borne over the wide\r\nsurface of the Pampas, when under water: on the other hand, over the\r\nwhole of Patagonia, the same or another debacle is supposed to have\r\nborne nothing but gravel,—the gravel and the fine mud in the\r\nneighbourhood of the Rios Negro and Colorado having been borne to an\r\nequal distance from the Cordillera, or imagined line of disturbance:\r\nassuredly directly opposite effects ought not to be attributed to the\r\nsame agency. Where, again, could a mass of fine sediment, charged with\r\ncalcareous matter in a fit state for chemical segregation, and in\r\nquantity sufficient to cover an area at least 750 miles long, and 400\r\nmiles broad, to a depth of from twenty to thirty feet to a hundred\r\nfeet, have been accumulated, ready to be transported by the supposed\r\ndebacle? To my mind it is little short of demonstration, that a great\r\nlapse of time was necessary for the production and deposition of the\r\nenormous amount of mudlike matter forming the Pampas; nor should I have\r\nnoticed the theory of a debacle, had it not been adduced by a\r\nnaturalist so eminent as M. d’Orbigny.\r\n\r\nA second theory, first suggested, I believe, by Sir W. Parish, is that\r\nthe Pampean formation was thrown down on low and marshy plains by the\r\nrivers of this country before they assumed their present courses. The\r\nappearance and composition of the deposit, the manner in which it\r\nslopes up and round the primary ranges, the nature of the underlying\r\nmarine beds, the estuary and sea-shells on the surface, the overlying\r\nsandstone beds at M. Hermoso, are all quite opposed to this view. Nor\r\ndo I believe that there is a single instance of a skeleton of one of\r\nthe extinct mammifers having been found in an upright position, as if\r\nit had been mired.\r\n\r\nThe third theory, of the truth of which I cannot entertain the smallest\r\ndoubt, is that the Pampean formation was slowly accumulated at the\r\nmouth of the former estuary of the Plata and in the sea adjoining it. I\r\nhave come to this conclusion from the reasons assigned against the two\r\nforegoing theories, and from simple geographical considerations. From\r\nthe numerous shells of the Azara labiata lying loose on the surface of\r\nthe plains, and near Buenos Ayres embedded in the tosca-rock, we know\r\nthat this formation not only was formerly covered by, but that the\r\nuppermost parts were deposited in, the brackish water of the ancient La\r\nPlata. Southward and seaward of Buenos Ayres, the plains were upheaved\r\nfrom under water inhabited by true marine shells. We further know from\r\nProfessor Ehrenberg’s examination of the twenty microscopical organisms\r\nin the mud round the tooth of the Mastodon high up the course of the\r\nParana, that the bottom- most part of this formation was of\r\nbrackish-water origin. A similar conclusion must be extended to the\r\nbeds of like composition, at the level of the sea and under it, at M.\r\nHermoso in Bahia Blanca. Dr. Carpenter finds that the harder varieties\r\nof tosca-rock, collected chiefly to the south, contain marine spongoid\r\nbodies, minute fragments of shells, corals, and Polythalamia; these\r\nperhaps may have been drifted inwards by the tides, from the more open\r\nparts of the sea. The absence of shells, throughout this deposit, with\r\nthe exception of the uppermost layers near Buenos Ayres, is a\r\nremarkable fact: can it be explained by the brackish condition of the\r\nwater, or by the deep mud at the bottom? I have stated that both the\r\nreddish mud and the concretions of tosca-rock are often penetrated by\r\nminute, linear cavities, such as frequently may be observed in\r\nfresh-water calcareous deposits:—were they produced by the burrowing of\r\nsmall worms? Only on this view of the Pampean formation having been of\r\nestuary origin, can the extraordinary numbers (presently to be alluded\r\nto) of the embedded mammiferous remains be explained. (It is almost\r\nsuperfluous to give the numerous cases (for instance, in Sumatra; Lyell\r\n“Principles” volume 3 page 325 sixth edition, of the carcasses of\r\nanimals having been washed out to sea by swollen rivers; but I may\r\nrefer to a recent account by Mr. Bettington “Asiatic Society” 1845 June\r\n21st, of oxen, deer, and bears being carried into the Gulf of Cambray;\r\nsee also the account in my “Journal” 2nd edition page 133, of the\r\nnumbers of animals drowned in the Plata during the great, often\r\nrecurrent, droughts.)\r\n\r\nWith respect to the first origin of the reddish mud, I will only\r\nremark, that the enormous area of Brazil consists in chief part of\r\ngneissic and other granitic rocks, which have suffered decomposition,\r\nand been converted into a red, gritty, argillaceous mass, to a greater\r\ndepth than in any other country which I have seen. The mixture of\r\nrounded grains, and even of small fragments and pebbles of quartz, in\r\nthe Pampean mud of Banda Oriental, is evidently due to the neighbouring\r\nand underlying primary rocks. The estuary mud was drifted during the\r\nPampean period in a much more southerly course, owing probably to the\r\neast and west primary ridges south of the Plata not having been then\r\nelevated, than the mud of the Plata at present is; for it was formerly\r\ndeposited as far south as the Colorado. The quantity of calcareous\r\nmatter in this formation, especially in those large districts where the\r\nwhole mass passes into tosca-rock, is very great: I have already\r\nremarked on the close resemblance in external and microscopical\r\nappearance, between this tosca-rock and the strata at Coquimbo, which\r\nhave certainly resulted from the decay and attrition of recent shells:\r\nI dare not, however, extend this conclusion to the calcareous rocks of\r\nthe Pampas, more especially as the underlying tertiary strata in\r\nwestern Banda Oriental show that at that period there was a copious\r\nemission of carbonate of lime, in connection with volcanic action. (I\r\nmay add, that there are nearly similar superficial calcareous beds at\r\nKing George’s Sound in Australia; and these undoubtedly have been\r\nformed by the disintegration of marine remains see “Volcanic Islands”\r\netc. page 144. There is, however, something very remarkable in the\r\nfrequency of superficial, thin beds of earthy calcareous matter, in\r\ndistricts where the surrounding rocks are not calcareous. Major\r\nCharters, in a Paper read before the Geographical Society April 13,\r\n1840 and abstracted in the “Athenaeum” page 317, states that this is\r\nthe case in parts of Mexico, and that he has observed similar\r\nappearances in many parts of South Africa. The circumstance of the\r\nuppermost stratum round the ragged Sierra Ventana, consisting of\r\ncalcareous or marly matter, without any covering of alluvial matter,\r\nstrikes me as very singular, in whatever manner we view the deposition\r\nand elevation of the Pampean formation.)\r\n\r\nThe Pampean formation, judging from its similar composition, and from\r\nthe apparent absolute specific identity of some of its mammiferous\r\nremains, and from the generic resemblance of others, belongs over its\r\nvast area— throughout Banda Oriental, Entre Rios, and the wide extent\r\nof the Pampas as far south as the Colorado,—to the same geological\r\nepoch. The mammiferous remains occur at all depths from the top to the\r\nbottom of the deposit; and I may add that nowhere in the Pampas is\r\nthere any appearance of much superficial denudation: some bones which I\r\nfound near the Guardia del Monte were embedded close to the surface;\r\nand this appears to have been the case with many of those discovered in\r\nBanda Oriental: on the Matanzas, twenty miles south of Buenos Ayres, a\r\nGlyptodon was embedded five feet beneath the surface; numerous remains\r\nwere found by S. Muniz, near Luxan, at an average depth of eighteen\r\nfeet; in Buenos Ayres a skeleton was disinterred at sixty feet depth,\r\nand on the Parana I have described two skeletons of the Mastodon only\r\nfive or six feet above the very base of the deposit. With respect to\r\nthe age of this formation, as judged of by the ordinary standard of the\r\nexistence of Mollusca, the only evidence within the limits of the true\r\nPampas which is at all trustworthy, is afforded by the still living\r\nAzara labiata being embedded in tosca-rock near Buenos Ayres. At Punta\r\nAlta, however, we have seen that several of the extinct mammifers, most\r\ncharacteristic of the Pampean formation, co-existed with twenty species\r\nof Mollusca, a barnacle and two corals, all still living on this same\r\ncoast;— for when we remember that the shells have a more ancient\r\nappearance than the bones; that many of the bones, though embedded in a\r\ncoarse conglomerate, are perfectly preserved; that almost all the parts\r\nof the skeleton of the Scelidotherium, even to the knee-cap, were lying\r\nin their proper relative positions; and that a large piece of the\r\nfragile dermal armour of a Dasypoid quadruped, connected with some of\r\nthe bones of the foot, had been entombed in a condition allowing the\r\ntwo sides to be doubled together, it must assuredly be admitted that\r\nthese mammiferous remains were embedded in a fresh state, and therefore\r\nthat the living animals co-existed with the co-embedded shells.\r\nMoreover, the Macrauchenia Patachonica (of which, according to\r\nProfessor Owen, remains also occur in the Pampas of Buenos Ayres, and\r\nat Punta Alta) has been shown by satisfactory evidence of another kind,\r\nto have lived on the plains of Patagonia long after the period when the\r\nadjoining sea was first tenanted by its present commonest molluscous\r\nanimals. We must, therefore, conclude that the Pampean formation\r\nbelongs, in the ordinary geological sense of the word, to the Recent\r\nPeriod. (M. d’Orbigny believes “Voyage” Part. Geolog. page 81, that\r\nthis formation, though “tres voisine de la notre, est neanmoins de\r\nbeaucoup anterieure a notre creation.”)\r\n\r\nAt St. Fe Bajada, the Pampean estuary formation, with its mammiferous\r\nremains, conformably overlies the marine tertiary strata, which (as\r\nfirst shown by M. d’Orbigny) are contemporaneous with those of\r\nPatagonia, and which, as we shall hereafter see, belong to a very\r\nancient tertiary stage. When examining the junction between these two\r\nformations, I thought that the concretionary layer of marl marked a\r\npassage between the marine and estuary stages. M. d’Orbigny disputes\r\nthis view (as given in my “Journal”), and I admit that it is erroneous,\r\nthough in some degree excusable, from their conformability and from\r\nboth abounding with calcareous matter. It would, indeed, have been a\r\ngreat anomaly if there had been a true passage between a deposit\r\ncontemporaneous with existing species of mollusca, and one in which all\r\nthe mollusca appear to be extinct. Northward of Santa Fe, M. d’Orbigny\r\nmet with ferruginous sandstones, marly rocks, and other beds, which he\r\nconsiders as a distinct and lower formation; but the evidence that they\r\nare not parts of the same with an altered mineralogical character, does\r\nnot appear to me quite satisfactory.\r\n\r\nIn Western Banda Oriental, while the marine tertiary strata were\r\naccumulating, there were volcanic eruptions, much silex and lime were\r\nprecipitated from solution, coarse conglomerates were formed, being\r\nderived probably from adjoining land, and layers of red mud and marly\r\nrocks, like those of the Pampean formation, were occasionally\r\ndeposited. The true Pampean deposit, with mammiferous remains, instead\r\nof as at Santa Fe overlying conformably the tertiary strata, is here\r\nseen at a lower level folding round and between the flat-topped,\r\ncliff-bounded hills, formed by a upheaval and denudation of these same\r\ntertiary strata. The upheaval, having occurred here earlier than at\r\nSanta Fe, may be naturally accounted for by the contemporaneous\r\nvolcanic action. At the Barrancas de S. Gregorio, the Pampean deposit,\r\nas we have seen, overlies and fills up furrows in coarse sand,\r\nprecisely like that now accumulating on the shores near the mouth of\r\nthe Plata. I can hardly believe that this loose and coarse sand is\r\ncontemporaneous with the old tertiary and often crystalline strata of\r\nthe more western parts of the province; and am induced to suspect that\r\nit is of subsequent origin. If that section near Colonia could be\r\nimplicitly trusted, in which, at a height of only fifteen feet above\r\nthe Plata, a bed of fresh-looking mussels, of an existing littoral\r\nspecies, appeared to lie between the sand and the Pampean mud, I should\r\nconclude that Banda Oriental must have stood, when the coarse sand was\r\naccumulating, at only a little below its present level, and had then\r\nsubsided, allowing the estuary Pampean mud to cover far and wide its\r\nsurface up to a height of some hundred feet; and that after this\r\nsubsidence the province had been uplifted to its present level.\r\n\r\nIn Western Banda Oriental, we know, from two unequivocal sections that\r\nthere is a mass, absolutely undistinguishable from the true Pampean\r\ndeposit, beneath the old tertiary strata. This inferior mass must be\r\nvery much more ancient than the upper deposit with its mammiferous\r\nremains, for it lies beneath the tertiary strata in which all the\r\nshells are extinct. Nevertheless, the lower and upper masses, as well\r\nas some intermediate layers, are so similar in mineralogical character,\r\nthat I cannot doubt that they are all of estuary origin, and have been\r\nderived from the same great source. At first it appeared to me\r\nextremely improbable, that mud of the same nature should have been\r\ndeposited on nearly the same spot, during an immense lapse of time,\r\nnamely, from a period equivalent perhaps to the Eocene of Europe to\r\nthat of the Pampean formation. But as, at the very commencement of the\r\nPampean period, if not at a still earlier period, the Sierra Ventana\r\nformed a boundary to the south,—the Cordillera or the plains in front\r\nof them to the west,—the whole province of Corrientes probably to the\r\nnorth, for, according to M. d’Orbigny, it is not covered by the Pampean\r\ndeposit,—and Brazil, as known by the remains in the caves, to the\r\nnorth-east; and as again, during the older tertiary period, land\r\nalready existed in Western Banda Oriental and near St. Fe Bajada, as\r\nmay be inferred from the vegetable debris, from the quantities of\r\nsilicified wood, and from the remains of a Toxodon found, according to\r\nM. d’Orbigny, in still lower strata, we may conclude, that at this\r\nancient period a great expanse of water was surrounded by the same\r\nrocky framework which now bounds the plains of Pampean formation. This\r\nhaving been the case, the circumstance of sediment of the same nature\r\nhaving been deposited in the same area during an immense lapse of time,\r\nthough highly remarkable, does not appear incredible.\r\n\r\nThe elevation of the Pampas, at least of the southern parts, has been\r\nslow and interrupted by several periods of rest, as may be inferred\r\nfrom the plains, cliffs, and lines of sand-dunes (with shells and\r\npumice-pebbles) standing at different heights. I believe, also, that\r\nthe Pampean mud continued to be deposited, after parts of this\r\nformation had already been elevated, in the same manner as mud would\r\ncontinue to be deposited in the estuary of the Plata, if the mud-banks\r\non its shores were now uplifted and changed into plains: I believe in\r\nthis from the improbability of so many skeletons and bones having been\r\naccumulated at one spot, where M. Hermoso now stands, at a depth of\r\nbetween eight hundred and one thousand feet, and at a vast distance\r\nfrom any land except small rocky islets,—as must have been the case, if\r\nthe high tosca-plain round the Ventana and adjoining Sierras, had not\r\nbeen already uplifted and converted into land, supporting mammiferous\r\nanimals. At Punta Alta we have good evidence that the gravel- strata,\r\nwhich certainly belong to the true Pampean period, were accumulated\r\nafter the elevation in that neighbourhood of the main part of the\r\nPampean deposit, whence the rounded masses of tosca-rock were derived,\r\nand that rolled fragment of black bone in the same peculiar condition\r\nwith the remains at Monte Hermoso.\r\n\r\nThe number of the mammiferous remains embedded in the Pampas is, as I\r\nhave remarked, wonderful: it should be borne in mind that they have\r\nalmost exclusively been found in the cliffs and steep banks of rivers,\r\nand that, until lately, they excited no attention amongst the\r\ninhabitants: I am firmly convinced that a deep trench could not be cut\r\nin any line across the Pampas, without intersecting the remains of some\r\nquadruped. It is difficult to form an opinion in what part of the\r\nPampas they are most numerous; in a limited spot they could not well\r\nhave been more numerous than they were at P. Alta; the number, however,\r\nlately found by Senor F. Muniz, near Luxan, in a central spot in the\r\nPampas, is extraordinarily great: at the end of this chapter I will\r\ngive a list of all the localities at which I have heard of remains\r\nhaving been discovered. Very frequently the remains consist of almost\r\nperfect skeletons; but there are, also, numerous single bones, as for\r\ninstance at St. Fe. Their state of preservation varies much, even when\r\nembedded near each other: I saw none others so perfectly preserved as\r\nthe heads of the Toxodon and Mylodon from the white soft earthy bed on\r\nthe Sarandis in Banda Oriental. It is remarkable that in two limited\r\nsections I found no less than five teeth separately embedded, and I\r\nheard of teeth having been similarly found in other parts: may we\r\nsuppose that the skeletons or heads were for a long time gently drifted\r\nby currents over the soft muddy bottom, and that the teeth\r\noccasionally, here and there, dropped out?\r\n\r\nIt may be naturally asked, where did these numerous animals live? From\r\nthe remarkable discoveries of MM. Lund and Clausen, it appears that\r\nsome of the species found in the Pampas inhabited the highlands of\r\nBrazil: the Mastodon Andium is embedded at great heights in the\r\nCordillera from north of the equator to at least as far south as Tarija\r\n(Humboldt states that the Mastodon has been discovered in New Granada:\r\nit has been found in Quito. When at Lima, I saw a tooth of a Mastodon\r\nin the possession of Don M. Rivero, found at Playa Chica on the\r\nMaranon, near the Guallaga. Every one has heard of the numerous remains\r\nof Mastodon in Bolivia.); and as there is no higher land, there can be\r\nlittle doubt that this Mastodon must have lived on the plains and\r\nvalleys of that great range. These countries, however, appear too far\r\ndistant for the habitation of the individuals entombed in the Pampas:\r\nwe must probably look to nearer points, for instance to the province of\r\nCorrientes, which, as already remarked, is said not to be covered by\r\nthe Pampean formation, and may therefore, at the period of its\r\ndeposition, have existed as dry land. I have already given my reasons\r\nfor believing that the animals embedded at M. Hermoso and at P. Alta in\r\nBahia Blanca, lived on adjoining land, formed of parts of the already\r\nelevated Pampean deposit. With respect to the food of these many great\r\nextinct quadrupeds, I will not repeat the facts given in my “Journal”\r\n(second edition page 85), showing that there is no correlation between\r\nthe luxuriance of the vegetation of a country and the size of its\r\nmammiferous inhabitants. I do not doubt that large animals could now\r\nexist, as far as the amount, not kind, of vegetation is concerned, on\r\nthe sterile plains of Bahia Blanca and of the R. Negro, as well as on\r\nthe equally, if not more sterile plains of Southern Africa. The\r\nclimate, however, may perhaps have somewhat deteriorated since the\r\nmammifers embedded at Bahia Blanca lived there; for we must not infer,\r\nfrom the continued existence of the same shells on the present coasts,\r\nthat there has been no change in climate; for several of these shells\r\nnow range northward along the shores of Brazil, where the most\r\nluxuriant vegetation flourishes under a tropical temperature. With\r\nrespect to the extinction, which at first fills the mind with\r\nastonishment, of the many great and small mammifers of this period, I\r\nmay also refer to the work above cited (second edition page 173), in\r\nwhich I have endeavoured to show, that however unable we may be to\r\nexplain the precise cause, we ought not properly to feel more surprised\r\nat a species becoming extinct than at one being rare; and yet we are\r\naccustomed to view the rarity of any particular species as an ordinary\r\nevent, not requiring any extraordinary agency.\r\n\r\nThe several mammifers embedded in the Pampean formation, which mostly\r\nbelong to extinct genera, and some even to extinct families or orders,\r\nand which differ nearly, if not quite, as much as do the Eocene\r\nmammifers of Europe from living quadrupeds having existed\r\ncontemporaneously with mollusca, all still inhabiting the adjoining\r\nsea, is certainly a most striking fact. It is, however, far from being\r\nan isolated one; for, during the late tertiary deposits of Britain, an\r\nelephant, rhinoceros, and hippopotamus co-existed with many recent land\r\nand fresh-water shells; and in North America, we have the best evidence\r\nthat a mastodon, elephant, megatherium, megalonyx, mylodon, an extinct\r\nhorse and ox, likewise co- existed with numerous land, fresh-water, and\r\nmarine recent shells. (Many original observations, and a summary on\r\nthis subject, are given in Mr. Lyell’s paper in the “Geological\r\nProceedings” volume 4 page 3 and in his “Travels in North America”\r\nvolume 1 page 164 and volume 2 page 60. For the European analogous\r\ncases see Mr. Lyell’s “Principles of Geology” 6th edition volume 1 page\r\n37.) The enumeration of these extinct North American animals naturally\r\nleads me to refer to the former closer relation of the mammiferous\r\ninhabitants of the two Americas, which I have discussed in my\r\n“Journal,” and likewise to the vast extent of country over which some\r\nof them ranged: thus the same species of the Megatherium, Megalonyx,\r\nEquus (as far as the state of their remains permits of identification),\r\nextended from the Southern United States of North America to Bahia\r\nBlanca, in latitude 39 degrees S., on the coast of Patagonia. The fact\r\nof these animals having inhabited tropical and temperate regions, does\r\nnot appear to me any great difficulty, seeing that at the Cape of Good\r\nHope several quadrupeds, such as the elephant and hippopotamus, range\r\nfrom the equator to latitude 35 degrees south. The case of the Mastodon\r\nAndium is one of more difficulty, for it is found from latitude 36\r\ndegrees S., over, as I have reason to believe, nearly the whole of\r\nBrazil, and up the Cordillera to regions which, according to M.\r\nd’Orbigny, border on perpetual snow, and which are almost destitute of\r\nvegetation: undoubtedly the climate of the Cordillera must have been\r\ndifferent when the mastodon inhabited it; but we should not forget the\r\ncase of the Siberian mammoth and rhinoceros, as showing how severe a\r\nclimate the larger pachydermata can endure; nor overlook the fact of\r\nthe guanaco ranging at the present day over the hot low deserts of\r\nPeru, the lofty pinnacles of the Cordillera, and the damp forest-clad\r\nland of Southern Tierra del Fuego; the puma, also, is found from the\r\nequator to the Strait of Magellan, and I have seen its footsteps only a\r\nlittle below the limits of perpetual snow in the Cordillera of Chile.\r\n\r\nAt the period, so recent in a geological sense, when these extinct\r\nmammifers existed, the two Americas must have swarmed with quadrupeds,\r\nmany of them of gigantic size; for, besides those more particularly\r\nreferred to in this chapter, we must include in this same period those\r\nwonderfully numerous remains, some few of them specifically, and others\r\ngenerically related to those of the Pampas, discovered by MM. Lund and\r\nClausen in the caves of Brazil. Finally, the facts here given show how\r\ncautious we ought to be in judging of the antiquity of a formation from\r\neven a great amount of difference between the extinct and living\r\nspecies in any one class of animals;—we ought even to be cautious in\r\naccepting the general proposition, that change in organic forms and\r\nlapse of time are at all, necessarily, correlatives.\r\n\r\nLOCALITIES WITHIN THE REGION OF THE PAMPAS WHERE GREAT BONES HAVE BEEN\r\nFOUND.\r\n\r\nThe following list, which includes every account which I have hitherto\r\nmet with of the discovery of fossil mammiferous remains in the Pampas,\r\nmay be hereafter useful to a geologist investigating this region, and\r\nit tends to show their extraordinary abundance. I heard of and saw many\r\nfossils, the original position of which I could not ascertain; and I\r\nreceived many statements too vague to be here inserted. Beginning to\r\nthe south:—we have the two stations in Bahia Blanca, described in this\r\nchapter, where at P. Alta, the Megatherium, Megalonyx, Scelidotherium,\r\nMylodon, Holophractus (or an allied genus), Toxodon, Macrauchenia, and\r\nan Equus were collected; and at M. Hermoso a Ctenomys, Hydrochaerus,\r\nsome other rodents and the bones of a great megatheroid quadruped.\r\nClose north-east of the S. Tapalguen, we have the Rios ‘Huesos’ (i.e.\r\n“bones”), which probably takes its name from large fossil bones. Near\r\nVilla Nuevo, and at Las Averias, not far from the Salado, three nearly\r\nperfect skeletons, one of the Megatherium, one of the Glyptodon\r\nclavipes, and one of some great Dasypoid quadruped, were found by the\r\nagent of Sir W. Parish (see his work “Buenos Ayres” etc. page 171). I\r\nhave seen the tooth of a Mastodon from the Salado; a little northward\r\nof this river, on the borders of a lake near the G. del Monte, I saw\r\nmany bones, and one large piece of dermal armour; higher up the Salado,\r\nthere is a place called Monte “Huesos.” On the Matanzas, about twenty\r\nmiles south of Buenos Ayres, the skeleton (vide page 178 of “Buenos\r\nAyres” etc. by Sir W. Parish) of a Glyptodon was found about five feet\r\nbeneath the surface; here also (see Catalogue of Royal College of\r\nSurgeons) remains of Glyptodon clavipes, G. ornatus, and G. reticulatus\r\nwere found. Signor Angelis, in a letter which I have seen, refers to\r\nsome great remains found in Buenos Ayres, at a depth of twenty varas\r\nfrom the surface. Seven leagues north of this city the same author\r\nfound the skeletons of Mylodon robustus and Glyptodon ornatus. From\r\nthis neighbourhood he has lately sent to the British Museum the\r\nfollowing fossils:—Remains of three or four individuals of Megatherium;\r\nof three species of Glyptodon; of three individuals of the Mastodon\r\nAndium; of Macrauchenia; of a second species of Toxodon, different from\r\nT. Platensis; and lastly, of the Machairodus, a wonderful large\r\ncarnivorous animal. M. d’Orbigny has lately received from the Recolate\r\n“Voyage” Pal. page 144), near Buenos Ayres, a tooth of Toxodon\r\nPlatensis.\r\n\r\nProceeding northward, along the west bank of the Parana, we come to the\r\nRio Luxan, where two skeletons of the Megatherium have been found; and\r\nlately, within eight leagues of the town of Luxan, Dr. F. X. Muniz has\r\ncollected (“British Packet” Buenos Ayres September 25, 1841), from an\r\naverage depth of eighteen feet, very numerous remains, of no less than,\r\nas he believes, nine distinct species of mammifers. At Areco, large\r\nbones have been found, which are believed, by the inhabitants, to have\r\nbeen changed from small bones, by the water of the river! At Arrecifes,\r\nthe Glyptodon, sent to the College of Surgeons, was found; and I have\r\nseen two teeth of a Mastodon from this quarter. At S. Nicolas, M.\r\nd’Orbigny found remains of a Canis, Ctenomys, and Kerodon; and M.\r\nIsabelle (“Voyage” page 332) refers to a gigantic Armadillo found\r\nthere. At S. Carlos, I heard of great bones. A little below the mouth\r\nof the Carcarana, the two skeletons of Mastodon were found; on the\r\nbanks of this river, near S. Miguel, I found teeth of the Mastodon and\r\nToxodon; and “Falkner” (page 55) describes the osseous armour of some\r\ngreat animal; I heard of many other bones in this neighbourhood. I have\r\nseen, I may add, in the possession of Mr. Caldcleugh, the tooth of a\r\nMastodon Andium, said to have been found in Paraguay; I may here also\r\nrefer to a statement in this gentleman’s travels (volume 1 page 48), of\r\na great skeleton having been found in the province of Bolivia in\r\nBrazil, on the R. de las Contas. The furthest point westward in the\r\nPampas, at which I have HEARD of fossil bones, was high up on the banks\r\nof R. Quinto.\r\n\r\nIn Entre Rios, besides the remains of the Mastodon, Toxodon, Equus, and\r\na great Dasypoid quadruped near St. Fe Bajada, I received an account of\r\nbones having been found a little S.E. of P. Gorda (on the Parana), and\r\nof an entire skeleton at Matanzas, on the Arroyo del Animal.\r\n\r\nIn Banda Oriental, besides the remains of the Toxodon, Mylodon, and two\r\nskeletons of great animals with osseous armour (distinct from that of\r\nthe Glyptodon), found on the Arroyos Sarandis and Berquelo, M. Isabelle\r\n(“Voyage” page 322) says, many bones have been found near the R. Negro,\r\nand on the R. Arapey, an affluent of the Paraguay, in latitude 30\r\ndegrees 40 minutes south. I heard of bones near the source of the A.\r\nVivoras. I saw the remains of a Dasypoid quadruped from the Arroyo\r\nSeco, close to M. Video; and M. d’Orbigny refers (“Voyage” Geolog. page\r\n24), to another found on the Pedernal, an affluent of the St. Lucia;\r\nand Signor Angelis, in a letter, states that a third skeleton of this\r\nfamily has been found, near Canelones. I saw a tooth of the Mastodon\r\nfrom Talas, another affluent of the St. Lucia. The most eastern point\r\nat which I heard of great bones having been found, was at Solis Grande,\r\nbetween M. Video and Maldonado.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\nON THE OLDER TERTIARY FORMATIONS OF PATAGONIA AND CHILE.\r\n\r\n\r\nRio Negro.—S.

America.—On the\r\ncontemporaneous deposition and preservation of sedimentary formations.\r\n\r\nRIO NEGRO.\r\n\r\nI can add little to the details given by M. d’Orbigny on the sandstone\r\nformation of this district. (“Voyage” Part Geolog. pages 57-65.) The\r\ncliffs to the south of the river are about two hundred feet in height,\r\nand are composed of sandstone of various tints and degrees of hardness.\r\nOne layer, which thinned out at both ends, consisted of earthy matter,\r\nof a pale reddish colour, with some gypsum, and very like (I speak\r\nafter comparison of the specimens brought home) Pampean mud: above this\r\nwas a layer of compact marly rock with dendritic manganese. Many blocks\r\nof a conglomerate of pumice-pebbles embedded in hard sandstone were\r\nstrewed at the foot of the cliff, and had evidently fallen from above.\r\nA few miles N.E. of the town, I found, low down in the sandstone, a\r\nbed, a few inches in thickness, of a white, friable, harsh-feeling\r\nsediment, which adheres to the tongue, is of easy fusibility, and of\r\nlittle specific gravity; examined under the microscope, it is seen to\r\nbe pumiceous tuff, formed of broken transparent crystals. In the cliffs\r\nsouth of the river, there is, also, a thin layer of nearly similar\r\nnature, but finer grained, and not so white; it might easily have been\r\nmistaken for a calcareous tuff, but it contains no lime: this substance\r\nprecisely resembles a most widely extended and thick formation in\r\nSouthern Patagonia, hereafter to be described, and which is remarkable\r\nfor being partially formed of infusoria. These beds, conjointly with\r\nthe conglomerate of pumice, are interesting, as showing the nature of\r\nthe volcanic action in the Cordillera during this old tertiary period.\r\n\r\nIn a bed at the base of the southern cliffs, M. d’Orbigny found two\r\nextinct fresh-water shells, namely, a Unio and Chilina. This bed rested\r\non one with bones of an extinct rodent, namely, the Megamys\r\nPatagoniensis; and this again on another with extinct marine shells.\r\nThe species found by M. d’Orbigny in different parts of this formation\r\nconsist of:—\r\n\r\n1. Ostrea Patagonica, d’Orbigny, “Voyage, Pal.” (also at St. Fe, and\r\nwhole coast of Patagonia). 2. Ostrea Ferrarisi, d’Orbigny, “Voyage,\r\nPal.” 3. Ostrea Alvarezii, d’Orbigny, “Voyage, Pal.” (also at St. Fe,\r\nand S. Josef). 4. Pecten Patagoniensis, d’Orbigny, “Voyage, Pal.” 5.\r\nVenus Munsterii, d’Orbigny, “Voyage, Pal.” (also at St. Fe). 6. Arca\r\nBonplandiana, d’Orbigny, “Voyage, Pal.” (also at St. Fe).\r\n\r\nAccording to M. d’Orbigny, the sandstone extends westward along the\r\ncoast as far as Port S. Antonio, and up the R. Negro far into the\r\ninterior: northward I traced it to the southern side of the Rio\r\nColorado, where it forms a low denuded plain. This formation, though\r\ncontemporaneous with that of the rest of Patagonia, is quite different\r\nin mineralogical composition, being connected with it only by the one\r\nthin white layer: this difference may be reasonably attributed to the\r\nsediment brought down in ancient times by the Rio Negro; by which\r\nagency, also, we can understand the presence of the fresh-water shells,\r\nand of the bones of land animals. Judging from the identity of four of\r\nthe above shells, this formation is contemporaneous (as remarked by M.\r\nd’Orbigny) with that under the Pampean deposit in Entre Rios and in\r\nBanda Oriental. The gravel capping the sandstone plain, with its\r\ncalcareous cement and nodules of gypsum, is probably, from the reasons\r\ngiven in the First Chapter, contemporaneous with the uppermost beds of\r\nthe Pampean formation on the upper plain north of the Colorado.\r\n\r\nSAN JOSEF.\r\n\r\nMy examination here was very short: the cliffs are about a hundred feet\r\nhigh; the lower third consists of yellowish-brown, soft, slightly\r\ncalcareous, muddy sandstone, parts of which when struck emit a fetid\r\nsmell. In this bed the great Ostraea Patagonica, often marked with\r\ndendritic manganese and small coral-lines, were extraordinarily\r\nnumerous. I found here the following shells:—\r\n\r\n1. Ostrea Patagonica, d’Orbigny, “Voyage, Pal.” (also at St. Fe and\r\nwhole coast of Patagonia). 2. Ostrea Alvarezii, d’Orbigny, “Voyage,\r\nPal.” (also at St. Fe and R. Negro). 3. Pecten Paranensis, d’Orbigny,\r\n“Voyage, Pal.” (also at St. Fe, S. Julian, and Port Desire). 4. Pecten\r\nDarwinianus, d’Orbigny, “Voyage, Pal.” (also at St. Fe). 5. Pecten\r\nactinodes, G.B. Sowerby. 6. Terebratula Patagonica, G.B. Sowerby (also\r\nS. Julian). 7. Casts of a Turritella.\r\n\r\nThe four first of these species occur at St. Fe in Entre Rios, and the\r\ntwo first in the sandstone of the Rio Negro. Above this fossiliferous\r\nmass, there is a stratum of very fine-grained, pale brown mudstone,\r\nincluding numerous laminae of selenite. All the strata appear\r\nhorizontal, but when followed by the eye for a long distance, they are\r\nseen to have a small easterly dip. On the surface we have the\r\nporphyritic gravel, and on it sand with recent shells.\r\n\r\nNUEVO GULF.\r\n\r\nFrom specimens and notes given me by Lieutenant Stokes, it appears that\r\nthe lower bed consists of soft muddy sandstone, like that of S. Josef,\r\nwith many imperfect shells, including the Pecten Paranensis, d’Orbigny,\r\ncasts of a Turritella and Scutella. On this there are two strata of the\r\npale brown mudstone, also like that of S. Josef, separated by a\r\ndarker-coloured, more argillaceous variety, including the Ostrea\r\nPatagonica. Professor Ehrenberg has examined this mudstone for me: he\r\nfinds in it three already known microscopic organisms, enveloped in a\r\nfine-grained pumiceous tuff, which I shall have immediately to describe\r\nin detail. Specimens brought to me from the uppermost bed, north of the\r\nRio Chupat, consist of this same substance, but of a whiter colour.\r\n\r\nTertiary strata, such as here described, appear to extend along the\r\nwhole coast between Rio Chupat and Port Desire, except where\r\ninterrupted by the underlying claystone porphyry, and by some\r\nmetamorphic rocks; these hard rocks, I may add, are found at intervals\r\nover a space of about five degrees of latitude, from Point Union to a\r\npoint between Port S. Julian and S. Cruz, and will be described in the\r\nensuing chapter. Many gigantic specimens of the Ostraea Patagonica were\r\ncollected in the Gulf of St. George.\r\n\r\nPORT DESIRE.\r\n\r\nA good section of the lowest fossiliferous mass, about forty feet in\r\nthickness, resting on claystone porphyry, is exhibited a few miles\r\nsouth of the harbour. The shells sufficiently perfect to be recognised\r\nconsist of:—\r\n\r\n1. Ostrea Patagonica, d’Orbigny, (also at St. Fe, and whole coast of\r\nPatagonia). 2. Pecten Paranensis, d’Orbigny, “Voyage, Pal.” (also at\r\nSt. Fe, S. Josef, S. Julian). 3. Pecten centralis, G.B. Sowerby (also\r\nat S. Julian and S. Cruz). 4. Cucullaea alta, G.B. Sowerby (also at S.\r\nCruz). 5. Nucula ornata, G.B. Sowerby. 6. Turritella Patagonica, G.B.\r\nSowerby.\r\n\r\nThe fossiliferous strata, when not denuded, are conformably covered by\r\na considerable thickness of the fine-grained pumiceous mudstone,\r\ndivided into two masses: the lower half is very fine-grained, slightly\r\nunctuous, and so compact as to break with a semi-conchoidal fracture,\r\nthough yielding to the nail; it includes laminae of selenite: the upper\r\nhalf precisely resembles the one layer at the Rio Negro, and with the\r\nexception of being whiter, the upper beds at San Josef and Nuevo Gulf.\r\nIn neither mass is there any trace to the naked eye of organic forms.\r\nTaking the entire deposit, it is generally quite white, or yellowish,\r\nor feebly tinted with green; it is either almost friable under the\r\nfinger, or as hard as chalk; it is of easy fusibility, of little\r\nspecific gravity, is not harsh to the touch, adheres to the tongue, and\r\nwhen breathed on exhales a strong aluminous odour; it sometimes\r\ncontains a very little calcareous matter, and traces (besides the\r\nincluded laminae) of gypsum. Under the microscope, according to\r\nProfessor Ehrenberg, it consists of minute, triturated, cellular,\r\nglassy fragments of pumice, with some broken crystals.\r\n(“Monatsberichten de konig. Akad. zu Berlin” vom April 1845.) In the\r\nminute glassy fragments, Professor Ehrenberg recognises organic\r\nstructures, which have been affected by volcanic heat: in the specimens\r\nfrom this place, and from Port S. Julian, he finds sixteen Polygastrica\r\nand twelve Phytolitharia. Of these organisms, seven are new forms, the\r\nothers being previously known: all are of marine, and chiefly of\r\noceanic, origin. This deposit to the naked eye resembles the crust\r\nwhich often appears on weathered surfaces of feldspathic rocks; it\r\nlikewise resembles those beds of earthy feldspathic matter, sometimes\r\ninterstratified with porphyritic rocks, as is the case in this very\r\ndistrict with the underlying purple claystone porphyry. From examining\r\nspecimens under a common microscope, and comparing them with other\r\nspecimens undoubtedly of volcanic origin, I had come to the same\r\nconclusion with Professor Ehrenberg, namely, that this great deposit,\r\nin its first origin, is of volcanic nature.\r\n\r\nPORT S. JULIAN.\r\n\r\n(FIGURE 17. SECTION OF THE STRATA EXHIBITED IN THE CLIFFS OF THE NINETY\r\nFEET PLAIN AT PORT S. JULIAN.\r\n\r\n(Section through beds from top to bottom: A, B, C, D, E, F.))\r\n\r\nOn the south side of the harbour, Figure 17 gives the nature of the\r\nbeds seen in the cliffs of the ninety feet plain. Beginning at the\r\ntop:—\r\n\r\n1st, the earthy mass (AA), including the remains of the Macrauchenia,\r\nwith recent shells on the surface.\r\n\r\nSecond, the porphyritic shingle (B), which in its lower part is\r\ninterstratified (owing, I believe, to redisposition during denudation)\r\nwith the white pumiceous mudstone.\r\n\r\nThird, this white mudstone, about twenty feet in thickness, and divided\r\ninto two varieties (C and D), both closely resembling the lower, fine-\r\ngrained, more unctuous and compact kind at Port Desire; and, as at that\r\nplace, including much selenite.\r\n\r\nFourth, a fossiliferous mass, divided into three main beds, of which\r\nthe uppermost is thin, and consists of ferruginous sandstone, with many\r\nshells of the great oyster and Pecten Paranensis; the middle bed (E) is\r\na yellowish earthy sandstone abounding with Scutellae; and the lowest\r\nbed (F) is an indurated, greenish, sandy clay, including large\r\nconcretions of calcareous sandstone, many shells of the great oyster,\r\nand in parts almost made up of fragments of Balanidae. Out of these\r\nthree beds, I procured the following twelve species, of which the two\r\nfirst were exceedingly numerous in individuals, as were the\r\nTerebratulae and Turritellae in certain layers:—\r\n\r\n1. Ostrea Patagonica, d’Orbigny, “Voyage, Pal.” (also at St. Fe, and\r\nwhole coast of Patagonia). 2. Pecten Paranensis, d’Orbigny, “Voyage,\r\nPal.” (St. Fe, S. Josef, Port Desire). 3. Pecten centralis, G.B.\r\nSowerby (also at Port Desire and S. Cruz). 4. Pecten geminatus, G.B.\r\nSowerby. 5. Terebratula Patagonica, G.B. Sowerby (also S. Josef). 6.\r\nStruthiolaria ornata, G.B. Sowerby (also S. Cruz). 7. Fusus\r\nPatagonicus, G.B. Sowerby. 8. Fusus Noachinus, G.B. Sowerby. 9.\r\nScalaria rugulosa, G.B. Sowerby. 10. Turritella ambulacrum, G.B.\r\nSowerby (also S. Cruz). 11. Pyrula, cast of, like P. ventricosa of\r\nSowerby, Tank Cat. 12. Balanus varians, G.B. Sowerby. 13. Scutella,\r\ndiffering from the species from Nuevo Gulf.\r\n\r\nAt the head of the inner harbour of Port S. Julian, the fossiliferous\r\nmass is not displayed, and the sea-cliffs from the water’s edge to a\r\nheight of between one and two hundred feet are formed of the white\r\npumiceous mudstone, which here includes innumerable, far-extended,\r\nsometimes horizontal, sometimes inclined or vertical laminae of\r\ntransparent gypsum, often about an inch in thickness. Further inland,\r\nwith the exception of the superficial gravel, the whole thickness of\r\nthe truncated hills, which represent a formerly continuous plain 950\r\nfeet in height, appears to be formed of this white mudstone: here and\r\nthere, however, at various heights, thin earthy layers, containing the\r\ngreat oyster, Pecten Paranensis and Turritella ambulacrum, are\r\ninterstratified; thus showing that the whole mass belongs to the same\r\nepoch. I nowhere found even a fragment of a shell actually in the white\r\ndeposit, and only a single cast of a Turritella. Out of the eighteen\r\nmicroscopic organisms discovered by Ehrenberg in the specimens from\r\nthis place, ten are common to the same deposit at Port Desire. I may\r\nadd that specimens of this white mudstone, with the same identical\r\ncharacters were brought me from two points,—one twenty miles north of\r\nS. Julian, where a wide gravel-capped plain, 350 feet in height, is\r\nthus composed; and the other forty miles south of S. Julian, where, on\r\nthe old charts, the cliffs are marked as “Chalk Hills.”\r\n\r\nSANTA CRUZ.\r\n\r\nThe gravel-capped cliffs at the mouth of the river are 355 feet in\r\nheight: the lower part, to a thickness of fifty or sixty feet, consists\r\nof a more or less hardened, darkish, muddy, or argillaceous sandstone\r\n(like the lowest bed of Port Desire), containing very many shells, some\r\nsilicified and some converted into yellow calcareous spar. The great\r\noyster is here numerous in layers; the Trigonocelia and Turritella are\r\nalso very numerous: it is remarkable that the Pecten Paranensis, so\r\ncommon in all other parts of the coast, is here absent: the shells\r\nconsist of:—\r\n\r\n1. Ostrea Patagonica, d’Orbigny; “Voyage Pal.” (also at St. Fe and\r\nwhole coast of Patagonia).\r\n2. Pecten centralis, G.B. Sowerby (also P. Desire and S. Julian).\r\n3. Venus meridionalis of G.B. Sowerby.\r\n4. Crassatella Lyellii, G.B. Sowerby.\r\n5. Cardium puelchum, G.B. Sowerby.\r\n6. Cardita Patagonica, G.B. Sowerby.\r\n7. Mactra rugata, G.B. Sowerby.\r\n8. Mactra Darwinii, G.B. Sowerby.\r\n9. Cucullaea alta, G.B. Sowerby (also P. Desire).\r\n10. Trigonocelia insolita, G.B. Sowerby.\r\n11. Nucula (?) glabra, G.B. Sowerby.\r\n12. Crepidula gregaria, G.B. Sowerby.\r\n13. Voluta alta, G.B. Sowerby.\r\n14. Trochus collaris, G.B. Sowerby.\r\n15. Natica solida (?), G.B. Sowerby\r\n16. Struthiolaria ornata, G.B. Sowerby (also P. Desire).\r\n17. Turritella ambulacrum, G.B. Sowerby (also P. S. Julian).\r\nImperfect fragments of the genera Byssoarca, Artemis, and Fusus.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe upper part of the cliff is generally divided into three great\r\nstrata, differing slightly in composition, but essentially resembling\r\nthe pumiceous mudstone of the places farther north; the deposit,\r\nhowever, here is more arenaceous, of greater specific gravity, and not\r\nso white: it is interlaced with numerous thin veins, partially or quite\r\nfilled with transverse fibres of gypsum; these fibres were too short to\r\nreach across the vein, have their extremities curved or bent: in the\r\nsame veins with the gypsum, and likewise in separate veins as well as\r\nin little nests, there is much powdery sulphate of magnesia (as\r\nascertained by Mr. Reeks) in an uncompressed form: I believe that this\r\nsalt has not heretofore been found in veins. Of the three beds, the\r\ncentral one is the most compact, and more like ordinary sandstone: it\r\nincludes numerous flattened spherical concretions, often united like a\r\nnecklace, composed of hard calcareous sandstone, containing a few\r\nshells: some of these concretions were four feet in diameter, and in a\r\nhorizontal line nine feet apart, showing that the calcareous matter\r\nmust have been drawn to the centres of attraction, from a distance of\r\nfour feet and a half on both sides. In the upper and lower\r\nfiner-grained strata, there were other concretions of a grey colour,\r\ncontaining calcareous matter, and so fine-grained and compact, as\r\nalmost to resemble porcelain- rock: I have seen exactly similar\r\nconcretions in a volcanic tufaceous bed in Chiloe. Although in this\r\nupper fine-grained strata, organic remains were very rare, yet I\r\nnoticed a few of the great oyster; and in one included soft ferruginous\r\nlayer, there were some specimens of the Cucullaea alta (found at Port\r\nDesire in the lower fossiliferous mass) and of the Mactra rugata, which\r\nlatter shell has been partially converted into gypsum.\r\n\r\n(FIGURE 18. SECTION OF THE PLAINS OF PATAGONIA, ON THE BANKS OF THE S.\r\nCRUZ.\r\n\r\n(Section through strata (from top to bottom)): Surface of plain with\r\nerratic boulders; 1,146 feet above the sea. a. Gravel and boulders, 212\r\nfeet thick. b. Basaltic lava, 322 feet thick. c, d and e. Sedimentary\r\nlayers, bed of small pebbles and talus respectively, total 592 feet\r\nthick. River of S. Cruz; here 280 feet above sea.)\r\n\r\nIn ascending the valley of the S. Cruz, the upper strata of the coast-\r\ncliffs are prolonged, with nearly the same characters, for fifty miles:\r\nat about this point, they begin in the most gradual and scarcely\r\nperceptible manner, to be banded with white lines; and after ascending\r\nten miles farther, we meet with distinct thin layers of whitish,\r\ngreenish, and yellowish fine-grained, fusible sediments. At eighty\r\nmiles from the coast, in a cliff thus composed, there were a few layers\r\nof ferruginous sandstone, and of an argillaceous sandstone with\r\nconcretions of marl like those in the Pampas. (At this spot, for a\r\nspace of three-quarters of a mile along the north side of the river,\r\nand for a width of half a mile, there has been a great slip, which has\r\nformed hills between sixty and seventy feet in height, and has tilted\r\nthe strata into highly inclined and even vertical positions. The strata\r\ngenerally dipped at an angle of 45 degrees towards the cliff from which\r\nthey had slided. I have observed in slips, both on a small and large\r\nscale, that this inward dip is very general. Is it due to the\r\nhydrostatic pressure of water percolating with difficulty through the\r\nstrata acting with greater force at the base of the mass than against\r\nthe upper part?) At one hundred miles from the coast, that is at a\r\ncentral point between the Atlantic and the Cordillera, we have the\r\nsection in Figure 18.\r\n\r\nThe upper half of the sedimentary mass, under the basaltic lava,\r\nconsists of innumerable zones of perfectly white bright green,\r\nyellowish and brownish, fine-grained, sometimes incoherent, sedimentary\r\nmatter. The white, pumiceous, trachytic tuff-like varieties are of\r\nrather greater specific gravity than the pumiceous mudstone on the\r\ncoast to the north; some of the layers, especially the browner ones,\r\nare coarser, so that the broken crystals are distinguishable with a\r\nweak lens. The layers vary in character in short distances. With the\r\nexception of a few of the Ostrea Patagonica, which appeared to have\r\nrolled down from the cliff above, no organic remains were found. The\r\nchief difference between these layers taken as a whole, and the upper\r\nbeds both at the mouth of the river and on the coast northward, seems\r\nto lie in the occasional presence of more colouring matter, and in the\r\nsupply having been intermittent; these characters, as we have seen,\r\nvery gradually disappear in descending the valley, and this fact may\r\nperhaps be accounted for by the currents of a more open sea having\r\nblended together the sediment from a distant and intermittent source.\r\n\r\nThe coloured layers in the foregoing section rest on a mass, apparently\r\nof great thickness (but much hidden by the talus), of soft sandstone,\r\nalmost composed of minute pebbles, from one-tenth to two-tenths of an\r\ninch in diameter, of the rocks (with the entire exception of the\r\nbasaltic lava) composing the great boulders on the surface of the\r\nplain, and probably composing the neighbouring Cordillera. Five miles\r\nhigher up the valley, and again thirty miles higher up (that is twenty\r\nmiles from the nearest range of the Cordillera), the lower plain\r\nincluded within the upper escarpments, is formed, as seen on the banks\r\nof the river, of a nearly similar but finer-grained, more earthy,\r\nlaminated sandstone, alternating with argillaceous beds, and containing\r\nnumerous moderately sized pebbles of the same rocks, and some shells of\r\nthe great Ostrea Patagonica. (I found at both places, but not in situ,\r\nquantities of coniferous and ordinary dicotyledonous silicified wood,\r\nwhich was examined for me by Mr. R. Brown.) As most of these shells had\r\nbeen rolled before being here embedded, their presence does not prove\r\nthat the sandstone belongs to the great Patagonian tertiary formation,\r\nfor they might have been redeposited in it, when the valley existed as\r\na sea-strait; but as amongst the pebbles there were none of basalt,\r\nalthough the cliffs on both sides of the valley are composed of this\r\nrock, I believe that the sandstone does belong to this formation. At\r\nthe highest point to which we ascended, twenty miles distant from the\r\nnearest slope of the Cordillera, I could see the horizontally zoned\r\nwhite beds, stretching under the black basaltic lava, close up to the\r\nmountains; so that the valley of the S. Cruz gives a fair idea of the\r\nconstitution of the whole width of Patagonia.\r\n\r\nBASALTIC LAVA OF THE S. CRUZ.\r\n\r\nThis formation is first met with sixty-seven miles from the mouth of\r\nthe river; thence it extends uninterruptedly, generally but not\r\nexclusively on the northern side of the valley, close up to the\r\nCordillera. The basalt is generally black and fine-grained, but\r\nsometimes grey and laminated; it contains some olivine, and high up the\r\nvalley much glassy feldspar, where, also, it is often amygdaloidal; it\r\nis never highly vesicular, except on the sides of rents and on the\r\nupper and lower, spherically laminated surfaces. It is often columnar;\r\nand in one place I saw magnificent columns, each face twelve feet in\r\nwidth, with their interstices filled up with calcareous tuff. The\r\nstreams rest conformably on the white sedimentary beds, but I nowhere\r\nsaw the actual junction; nor did I anywhere see the white beds actually\r\nsuperimposed on the lava; but some way up the valley at the foot of the\r\nuppermost escarpments, they must be thus superimposed. Moreover, at the\r\nlowest point down the valley, where the streams thin out and terminate\r\nin irregular projections, the spaces or intervals between these\r\nprojections are filled up to the level of the now denuded and\r\ngravel-capped surfaces of the plains, with the white-zoned sedimentary\r\nbeds; proving that this matter continued to be deposited after the\r\nstreams had flowed. Hence we may conclude that the basalt is\r\ncontemporaneous with the upper parts of the great tertiary formation.\r\n\r\nThe lava where first met with is 130 feet in thickness: it there\r\nconsists of two, three, or perhaps more streams, divided from each\r\nother by vesicular spheroids like those on the surface. From the\r\nstreams having, as it appears, extended to different distances, the\r\nterminal points are of unequal heights. Generally the surface of the\r\nbasalt is smooth them in one part high up the valley, it was so uneven\r\nand hummocky, that until I afterwards saw the streams extending\r\ncontinuously on both sides of the valley up to a height of about three\r\nthousand feet close to the Cordillera, I thought that the craters of\r\neruption were probably close at hand. This hummocky surface I believe\r\nto have been caused by the crossing and heaping up of different\r\nstreams. In one place, there were several rounded ridges about twenty\r\nfeet in height, some of them as broad as high, and some broader, which\r\ncertainly had been formed whilst the lava was fluid, for in transverse\r\nsections each ridge was seen to be concentrically laminated, and to be\r\ncomposed of imperfect columns radiating from common centres, like the\r\nspokes of wheels.\r\n\r\nThe basaltic mass where first met with is, as I have said, 130 feet in\r\nthickness, and, thirty-five miles higher up the valley, it increases to\r\n322 feet. In the first fourteen and a half miles of this distance, the\r\nupper surface of the lava, judging from three measurements taken above\r\nthe level of the river (of which the apparently very uniform\r\ninclination has been calculated from its total height at a point 135\r\nmiles from the mouth), slopes towards the Atlantic at an angle of only\r\n0 degrees 7 minutes twenty seconds: this must be considered only as an\r\napproximate measurement, but it cannot be far wrong. Taking the whole\r\nthirty-five miles, the upper surface slopes at an angle of 0 degrees 10\r\nminutes 53 seconds; but this result is of no value in showing the\r\ninclination of any one stream, for halfway between the two points of\r\nmeasurement, the surface suddenly rises between one hundred and two\r\nhundred feet, apparently caused by some of the uppermost streams having\r\nextended thus far and no farther. From the measurement made at these\r\ntwo points, thirty-five miles apart, the mean inclination of the\r\nsedimentary beds, over which the lava has flowed, is NOW (after\r\nelevation from under the sea) only 0 degrees 7 minutes 52 seconds: for\r\nthe sake of comparison, it may be mentioned that the bottom of the\r\npresent sea in a line from the mouth of the S. Cruz to the Falkland\r\nIslands, from a depth of seventeen fathoms to a depth of eighty-five\r\nfathoms, declines at an angle of 0 degrees 1 minute 22 seconds; between\r\nthe beach and the depth of seventeen fathoms, the slope is greater.\r\nFrom a point about half-way up the valley, the basaltic mass rises more\r\nabruptly towards the foot of the Cordillera, namely, from a height of\r\n1,204 feet, to about 3,000 feet above the sea.\r\n\r\nThis great deluge of lava is worthy, in its dimensions, of the great\r\ncontinent to which it belongs. The aggregate streams have flowed from\r\nthe Cordillera to a distance (unparalleled, I believe, in any case yet\r\nknown) of about one hundred geographical miles. Near their furthest\r\nextremity their total thickness is 130 feet, which increase thirty-five\r\nmiles farther inland, as we have just seen, to 322 feet. The least\r\ninclination given by M. E. de Beaumont of the upper surface of a\r\nlava-stream, namely 0 degrees 30 minutes, is that of the great\r\nsubaerial eruption in 1783 from Skaptar Jukul in Iceland; and M. E. de\r\nBeaumont shows that it must have flowed down a mean inclination of less\r\nthan 0 degrees 20 minutes. (“Memoires pour servir” etc. pages 178 and\r\n217.) But we now see that under the pressure of the sea, successive\r\nstreams have flowed over a smooth bottom with a mean inclination of not\r\nmore than 0 degrees 7 minutes 52 seconds; and that the upper surface of\r\nthe terminal portion (over a space of fourteen and a half miles) has an\r\ninclination of not more than 0 degrees 7 minutes 20 seconds. If the\r\nelevation of Patagonia has been greater nearer the Cordillera than near\r\nthe Atlantic (as is probable), then these angles are now all too large.\r\nI must repeat, that although the foregoing measurements, which were all\r\ncarefully taken with the barometer, may not be absolutely correct, they\r\ncannot be widely erroneous.\r\n\r\nSouthward of the S. Cruz, the cliffs of the 840 feet plain extend to\r\nCoy Inlet, and owing to the naked patches of the white sediment, they\r\nare said on the charts to be “like the coast of Kent.” At Coy Inlet the\r\nhigh plain trends inland, leaving flat-topped outliers. At Port\r\nGallegos (latitude 51 degrees 35 minutes, and ninety miles south of S.\r\nCruz), I am informed by Captain Sulivan, R.N., that there is a\r\ngravel-capped plain from two to three hundred feet in height, formed of\r\nnumerous strata, some fine-grained and pale-coloured, like the upper\r\nbeds at the mouth of the S. Cruz, others rather dark and coarser, so as\r\nto resemble gritstones or tuffs; these latter include rather large\r\nfragments of apparently decomposed volcanic rocks; there are, also,\r\nincluded layers of gravel. This formation is highly remarkable, from\r\nabounding with mammiferous remains, which have not as yet been examined\r\nby Professor Owen, but which include some large, but mostly small,\r\nspecies of Pachydermata, Edentata, and Rodentia. From the appearance of\r\nthe pale-coloured, fine-grained beds, I was inclined to believe that\r\nthey corresponded with the upper beds of the S. Cruz; but Professor\r\nEhrenberg, who has examined some of the specimens, informs me that the\r\nincluded microscopical organisms are wholly different, being fresh and\r\nbrackish-water forms. Hence the two to three hundred feet plain at Port\r\nGallegos is of unknown age, but probably of subsequent origin to the\r\ngreat Patagonian tertiary formation.\r\n\r\nEASTERN TIERRA DEL FUEGO.\r\n\r\nJudging from the height, the general appearance, and the white colour\r\nof the patches visible on the hill sides, the uppermost plain, both on\r\nthe north and western side of the Strait of Magellan, and along the\r\neastern coast of Tierra del Fuego as far south as near Port St.\r\nPolycarp, probably belongs to the great Patagonian tertiary formation,\r\nThese higher table- ranges are fringed by low, irregular, extensive\r\nplains, belonging to the boulder formation (Described in the\r\n“Geological Transactions” volume 6 page 415.), and composed of coarse\r\nunstratified masses, sometimes associated (as north of C. Virgin’s)\r\nwith fine, laminated, muddy sandstones. The cliffs in Sebastian Bay are\r\n200 feet in height, and are composed of fine sandstones, often in\r\ncurvilinear layers, including hard concretions of calcareous sandstone,\r\nand layers of gravel. In these beds there are fragments of wood, legs\r\nof crabs, barnacles encrusted with corallines still partially retaining\r\ntheir colour, imperfect fragments of a Pholas distinct from any known\r\nspecies, and of a Venus, approaching very closely to, but slightly\r\ndifferent in form from, the V. lenticularis, a species living on the\r\ncoast of Chile. Leaves of trees are numerous between the laminae of the\r\nmuddy sandstone; they belong, as I am informed by Dr. J.D. Hooker, to\r\nthree species of deciduous beech, different from the two species which\r\ncompose the great proportion of trees in this forest-clad land.\r\n(“Botany of the Antarctic Voyage” page 212.) From these facts it is\r\ndifficult to conjecture, whether we here see the basal part of the\r\ngreat Patagonian formation, or some later deposit.\r\n\r\nA SUMMARY ON THE PATAGONIAN TERTIARY FORMATION.\r\n\r\nFour out of the seven fossil shells, from St. Fe in Entre Rios, were\r\nfound by M. d’Orbigny in the sandstone of the Rio Negro, and by me at\r\nSan Josef. Three out of the six from San Josef are identical with those\r\nfrom Port Desire and S. Julian, which two places have together fifteen\r\nspecies, out of which three are common to both. Santa Cruz has\r\nseventeen species, out of which five are common to Port Desire and S.\r\nJulian. Considering the difference in latitude between these several\r\nplaces, and the small number of species altogether collected, namely\r\nthirty-six, I conceive the above proportional number of species in\r\ncommon, is sufficient to show that the lower fossiliferous mass belongs\r\nnearly, I do not say absolutely, to the same epoch. What this epoch may\r\nbe, compared with the European tertiary stages, M. d’Orbigny will not\r\npretend to determine. The thirty-six species (including those collected\r\nby myself and by M. d’Orbigny) are all extinct, or at least unknown;\r\nbut it should be borne in mind, that the present coast consists of\r\nshingle, and that no one, I believe, has dredged here for shells; hence\r\nit is not improbable that some of the species may hereafter be found\r\nliving. Some few of the species are closely related with existing ones;\r\nthis is especially the case, according to M. d’Orbigny and Mr. Sowerby,\r\nwith the Fusus Patagonicus; and, according to Mr. Sowerby, with the\r\nPyrula, the Venus meridionalis, the Crepidula gregaria, and the\r\nTurritella ambulacrum, and T. Patagonica. At least three of the genera,\r\nnamely, Cucullaea, Crassatella, and (as determined by Mr. Sowerby)\r\nStruthiolaria, are not found in this quarter of the world; and\r\nTrigonocelia is extinct. The evidence taken altogether indicates that\r\nthis great tertiary formation is of considerable antiquity; but when\r\ntreating of the Chilean beds, I shall have to refer again to this\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nThe white pumiceous mudstone, with its abundant gypsum, belongs to the\r\nsame general epoch with the underlying fossiliferous mass, as may be\r\ninferred from the shells included in the intercalated layers at Nuevo\r\nGulf, S. Julian, and S. Cruz. Out of the twenty-seven marine\r\nmicroscopic structures found by Professor Ehrenberg in the specimens\r\nfrom S. Julian and Port Desire, ten are common to these two places: the\r\nthree found at Nuevo Gulf are distinct. I have minutely described this\r\ndeposit, from its remarkable characters and its wide extension. From\r\nCoy Inlet to Port Desire, a distance of 230 miles, it is certainly\r\ncontinuous; and I have reason to believe that it likewise extends to\r\nthe Rio Chupat, Nuevo Gulf, and San Josef, a distance of 570 miles: we\r\nhave, also, seen that a single layer occurs at the Rio Negro. At Port\r\nS. Julian it is from eight to nine hundred feet in thickness; and at S.\r\nCruz it extends, with a slightly altered character, up to the\r\nCordillera. From its microscopic structure, and from its analogy with\r\nother formations in volcanic districts, it must be considered as\r\noriginally of volcanic origin: it may have been formed by the\r\nlong-continued attrition of vast quantities of pumice, or judging from\r\nthe manner in which the mass becomes, in ascending the valley of S.\r\nCruz, divided into variously coloured layers, from the long-continued\r\neruption of clouds of fine ashes. In either case, we must conclude,\r\nthat the southern volcanic orifices of the Cordillera, now in a dormant\r\nstate, were at about this period over a wide space, and for a great\r\nlength of time, in action. We have evidence of this fact, in the\r\nlatitude of the Rio Negro, in the sandstone-conglomerate with pumice,\r\nand demonstrative proof of it, at S. Cruz, in the vast deluges of\r\nbasaltic lava: at this same tertiary period, also, there is distinct\r\nevidence of volcanic action in Western Banda Oriental.\r\n\r\nThe Patagonian tertiary formation extends continuously, judging from\r\nfossils alone, from S. Cruz to near the Rio Colorado, a distance of\r\nabove six hundred miles, and reappears over a wide area in Entre Rios\r\nand Banda Oriental, making a total distance of 1,100 miles; but this\r\nformation undoubtedly extends (though no fossils were collected) far\r\nsouth of the S. Cruz, and, according to M. d’Orbigny, 120 miles north\r\nof St. Fe. At S. Cruz we have seen that it extends across the\r\ncontinent; being on the coast about eight hundred feet in thickness\r\n(and rather more at S. Julian), and rising with the contemporaneous\r\nlava-streams to a height of about three thousand feet at the base of\r\nthe Cordillera. It rests, wherever any underlying formation can be\r\nseen, on plutonic and metamorphic rocks. Including the newer Pampean\r\ndeposit, and those strata in Eastern Tierra del Fuego of doubtful age,\r\nas well as the boulder formation, we have a line of more than\r\ntwenty-seven degrees of latitude, equal to that from the Straits of\r\nGibraltar to the south of Iceland, continuously composed of tertiary\r\nformations. Throughout this great space the land has been upraised,\r\nwithout the strata having been in a single instance, as far as my means\r\nof observation went, unequally tilted or dislocated by a fault.\r\n\r\nTERTIARY FORMATIONS ON THE WEST COAST.\r\nCHONOS ARCHIPELAGO.\r\n\r\nThe numerous islands of this group, with the exception of Lemus, Ypun,\r\nconsist of metamorphic schists; these two islands are formed of softish\r\ngrey and brown, fusible, often laminated sandstones, containing a few\r\npebbles, fragments of black lignite, and numerous mammillated\r\nconcretions of hard calcareous sandstone. Out of these concretions at\r\nYpun (latitude 40 degrees 30 minutes S.), I extracted the four\r\nfollowing extinct species of shells:—\r\n\r\n1. Turritella suturalis, G.B. Sowerby (also Navidad). 2. Sigaretus\r\nsubglobosus, G.B. Sowerby (also Navidad). 3. Cytheraea (?) sulculosa\r\n(?), G.B. Sowerby (also Chiloe and Huafo?). 4. Voluta, fragments of.\r\n\r\nIn the northern parts of this group there are some cliffs of gravel and\r\nof the boulder formation. In the southern part (at P. Andres in Tres\r\nMontes), there is a volcanic formation, probably of tertiary origin.\r\nThe lavas attain a thickness of from two to three hundred feet; they\r\nare extremely variable in colour and nature, being compact, or\r\nbrecciated, or cellular, or amygdaloidal with zeolite, agate and bole,\r\nor porphyritic with glassy albitic feldspar. There is also much\r\nimperfect rubbly pitchstone, with the interstices charged with powdery\r\ncarbonate of lime apparently of contemporaneous origin. These lavas are\r\nconformably associated with strata of breccia and of brown tuff\r\ncontaining lignite. The whole mass has been broken up and tilted at an\r\nangle of 45 degrees, by a series of great volcanic dikes, one of which\r\nwas thirty yards in breadth. This volcanic formation resembles one,\r\npresently to be described, in Chiloe.\r\n\r\nHUAFO.\r\n\r\nThis island lies between the Chonos and Chiloe groups: it is about\r\neight hundred feet high, and perhaps has a nucleus of metamorphic\r\nrocks. The strata which I examined consisted of fine-grained muddy\r\nsandstones, with fragments of lignite and concretions of calcareous\r\nsandstone. I collected the following extinct shells, of which the\r\nTurritella was in great numbers:—\r\n\r\n1. Bulla cosmophila, G.B. Sowerby. 2. Pleurotoma subaequalis, G.B.\r\nSowerby. 3. Fusus cleryanus, d’Orbigny, “Voyage Pal.” (also at\r\nCoquimbo). 4. Triton leucostomoides, G.B. Sowerby. 5. Turritella\r\nChilensis, G.B. Sowerby (also Mocha). 6. Venus, probably a distinct\r\nspecies, but very imperfect. 7. Cytheraea (?) sulculosa (?), probably a\r\ndistinct species, but very imperfect. 8. Dentalium majus, G.B. Sowerby.\r\n\r\nCHILOE.\r\n\r\nThis fine island is about one hundred miles in length. The entire\r\nsouthern part, and the whole western coast, consists of mica-schist,\r\nwhich likewise is seen in the ravines of the interior. The central\r\nmountains rise to a height of 3,000 feet, and are said to be partly\r\nformed of granite and greenstone: there are two small volcanic\r\ndistricts. The eastern coast, and large parts of the northern extremity\r\nof the island are composed of gravel, the boulder formation, and\r\nunderlying horizontal strata. The latter are well displayed for twenty\r\nmiles north and south of Castro; they vary in character from common\r\nsandstone to fine-grained, laminated mudstones: all the specimens which\r\nI examined are easily fusible, and some of the beds might be called\r\nvolcanic grit-stones. These latter strata are perhaps related to a mass\r\nof columnar trachyte which occurs behind Castro. The sandstone\r\noccasionally includes pebbles, and many fragments and layers of\r\nlignite; of the latter, some are apparently formed of wood and others\r\nof leaves: one layer on the N.W. side of Lemuy is nearly two feet in\r\nthickness. There is also much silicified wood, both common\r\ndicotyledonous and coniferous: a section of one specimen in the\r\ndirection of the medullary rays has, as I am informed by Mr. R. Brown,\r\nthe discs in a double row placed alternately, and not opposite as in\r\nthe true Araucaria. I found marine remains only in one spot, in some\r\nconcretions of hard calcareous sandstone: in several other districts I\r\nhave observed that organic remains were exclusively confined to such\r\nconcretions; are we to account for this fact, by the supposition that\r\nthe shells lived only at these points, or is it not more probable that\r\ntheir remains were preserved only where concretions were formed? The\r\nshells here are in a bad state, they consist of:—\r\n\r\n1. Tellinides (?) oblonga, G.B. Sowerby (a solenella in M. d’Orbigny’s\r\nopinion). 2. Natica striolata, G.B. Sowerby. 3. Natica (?) pumila, G.B.\r\nSowerby. 4. Cytheraea (?) sulculosa, G.B. Sowerby (also Ypun and\r\nHuafo?).\r\n\r\nAt the northern extremity of the island, near S. Carlos, there is a\r\nlarge volcanic formation, between five and seven hundred feet in\r\nthickness. The commonest lava is blackish-grey or brown, either\r\nvesicular, or amygdaloidal with calcareous spar and bole: most even of\r\nthe darkest varieties fuse into a pale-coloured glass. The next\r\ncommonest variety is a rubbly, rarely well characterised pitchstone\r\n(fusing into a white glass) which passes in the most irregular manner\r\ninto stony grey lavas. This pitchstone, as well as some purple\r\nclaystone porphyry, certainly flowed in the form of streams. These\r\nvarious lavas often pass, at a considerable depth from the surface, in\r\nthe most abrupt and singular manner into wacke. Great masses of the\r\nsolid rock are brecciated, and it was generally impossible to discover\r\nwhether the recementing process had been an igneous or aqueous action.\r\n(In a cliff of the hardest fragmentary mass, I found several tortuous,\r\nvertical veins, varying in thickness from a few tenths of an inch to\r\none inch and a half, of a substance which I have not seen described. It\r\nis glossy, and of a brown colour; it is thinly laminated, with the\r\nlaminae transparent and elastic; it is a little harder than calcareous\r\nspar; it is infusible under the blowpipe, sometimes decrepitates, gives\r\nout water, curls up, blackens, and becomes magnetic. Borax easily\r\ndissolves a considerable quantity of it, and gives a glass tinged with\r\ngreen. I have no idea what its true nature is. On first seeing it, I\r\nmistook it for lignite!) The beds are obscurely separated from each\r\nother; they are sometimes parted by seams of tuff and layers of\r\npebbles. In one place they rested on, and in another place were capped\r\nby, tuffs and girt-stones, apparently of submarine origin.\r\n\r\nThe neighbouring peninsula of Lacuy is almost wholly formed of\r\ntufaceous deposits, connected probably in their origin with the\r\nvolcanic hills just described. The tuffs are pale-coloured, alternating\r\nwith laminated mudstones and sandstones (all easily fusible), and\r\npassing sometimes into fine-grained white beds strikingly resembling\r\nthe great upper infusorial deposit of Patagonia, and sometimes into\r\nbrecciolas with pieces of pumice in the last stage of decay; these\r\nagain pass into ordinary coarse breccias and conglomerates of hard\r\nrocks. Within very short distances, some of the finer tuffs often\r\npassed into each other in a peculiar manner, namely, by irregular\r\npolygonal concretions of one variety increasing so much and so suddenly\r\nin size, that the second variety, instead of any longer forming the\r\nentire mass, was left merely in thin veins between the concretions. In\r\na straight line of cliffs, at Point Tenuy, I examined the following\r\nremarkable section (Figure 19):—\r\n\r\n(FIGURE 19.)\r\n\r\nOn the left hand, the lower part (AA) consists of regular, alternating\r\nstrata of brown tuffs and greenish laminated mudstone, gently inclined\r\nto the right, and conformably covered by a mass (B left) of a white,\r\ntufaceous and brecciolated deposit. On the right hand, the whole cliff\r\n(BB right) consists of the same white tufaceous matter, which on this\r\nside presents scarcely a trace of stratification, but to the left\r\nbecomes very gradually and rather indistinctly divided into strata\r\nquite conformable with the underlying beds (AA): moreover, a few\r\nhundred yards further to the left, where the surface has been less\r\ndenuded, the tufaceous strata (B left) are conformably covered by\r\nanother set of strata, like the underlying ones (AA) of this section.\r\nIn the middle of the diagram, the beds (AA) are seen to be abruptly cut\r\noff, and to abut against the tufaceous non-stratified mass; but the\r\nline of junction has been accidentally not represented steep enough,\r\nfor I particularly noticed that before the beds had been tilted to the\r\nright, this line must have been nearly vertical. It appears that a\r\ncurrent of water cut for itself a deep and steep submarine channel, and\r\nat the same time or afterwards filled it up with the tufaceous and\r\nbrecciolated matter, and spread the same over the surrounding submarine\r\nbeds; the matter becoming stratified in these more distant and less\r\ntroubled parts, and being moreover subsequently covered up by other\r\nstrata (like AA) not shown in the diagram. It is singular that three of\r\nthe beds (of AA) are prolonged in their proper direction, as\r\nrepresented, beyond the line of junction into the white tufaceous\r\nmatter: the prolonged portions of two of the beds are rounded; in the\r\nthird, the terminal fragment has been pushed upwards: how these beds\r\ncould have been left thus prolonged, I will not pretend to explain. In\r\nanother section on the opposite side of a promontory, there was at the\r\nfoot of this same line of junction, that is at the bottom of the old\r\nsubmarine channel, a pile of fragments of the strata (AA), with their\r\ninterstices filled up with white tufaceous matter: this is exactly what\r\nmight have been anticipated under such circumstances.\r\n\r\n(FIGURE 20. GROUND PLAN SHOWING THE RELATION BETWEEN VEINS AND\r\nCONCRETIONARY ZONES IN A MASS OF TUFF.)\r\n\r\nThe various tufaceous and other beds at this northern end of Chiloe\r\nprobably belong to about the same age with those near Castro, and they\r\ncontain, as there, many fragments of black lignite and of silicified\r\nand pyritous wood, often embedded close together. They also contain\r\nmany and singular concretions: some are of hard calcareous sandstone,\r\nin which it would appear that broken volcanic crystals and scales of\r\nmica have been better preserved (as in the case of the organic remains\r\nnear Castro) than in the surrounding mass. Other concretions in the\r\nwhite brecciola are of a hard, ferruginous, yet fusible, nature; they\r\nare as round as cannon-balls, and vary from two or three inches to two\r\nfeet in diameter; their insides generally consist either of fine,\r\nscarcely coherent volcanic sand (The frequent tendency in iron to form\r\nhollow concretions or shell containing incoherent matter is singular;\r\nD’Aubuisson (“Traite de Geogn.” tome 1 page 318) remarks on this\r\ncircumstance.), or of an argillaceous tuff; in this latter case, the\r\nexternal crust was quite thin and hard. Some of these spherical balls\r\nwere encircled in the line of their equators, by a necklace-like row of\r\nsmaller concretions. Again there were other concretions, irregularly\r\nformed, and composed of a hard, compact, ash- coloured stone, with an\r\nalmost porcelainous fracture, adhesive to the tongue, and without any\r\ncalcareous matter. These beds are, also, interlaced by many veins,\r\ncontaining gypsum, ferruginous matter, calcareous spar, and agate. It\r\nwas here seen with remarkable distinctness, how intimately\r\nconcretionary action and the production of fissures and veins are\r\nrelated together. Figure 20 is an accurate representation of a\r\nhorizontal space of tuff, about four feet long by two and a half in\r\nwidth: the double lines represent the fissures partially filled with\r\noxide of iron and agate: the curvilinear lines show the course of the\r\ninnumerable, concentric, concretionary zones of different shades of\r\ncolour and of coarseness in the particles of tuff. The symmetry and\r\ncomplexity of the arrangement gave the surface an elegant appearance.\r\nIt may be seen how obviously the fissures determine (or have been\r\ndetermined by) the shape, sometimes of the whole concretion, and\r\nsometimes only of its central parts. The fissures also determine the\r\ncurvatures of the long undulating zones of concretionary action. From\r\nthe varying composition of the veins and concretions, the amount of\r\nchemical action which the mass has undergone is surprisingly great; and\r\nit would likewise appear from the difference in size in the particles\r\nof the concretionary zones, that the mass, also, has been subjected to\r\ninternal mechanical movements.\r\n\r\nIn the peninsula of Lacuy, the strata over a width of four miles have\r\nbeen upheaved by three distinct, and some other indistinct, lines of\r\nelevation, ranging within a point of north and south. One line, about\r\ntwo hundred feet in height, is regularly anticlinal, with the strata\r\ndipping away on both sides, at an angle of 15 degrees, from a central\r\n“valley of elevation,” about three hundred yards in width. A second\r\nnarrow steep ridge, only sixty feet high, is uniclinal, the strata\r\nthroughout dipping westward; those on both flanks being inclined at an\r\nangle of from ten to fifteen degrees; whilst those on the ridge dip in\r\nthe same direction at an angle of between thirty and forty degrees.\r\nThis ridge, traced northwards, dies away; and the beds at its terminal\r\npoint, instead of dipping westward, are inclined 12 degrees to the\r\nnorth. This case interested me, as being the first in which I found in\r\nSouth America, formations perhaps of tertiary origin, broken by lines\r\nof elevation.\r\n\r\nVALDIVIA: ISLAND OF MOCHA.\r\n\r\nThe formations of Chiloe seem to extend with nearly the same character\r\nto Valdivia, and for some leagues northward of it: the underlying rocks\r\nare micaceous schists, and are covered up with sandstone and other\r\nsedimentary beds, including, as I was assured, in many places layers of\r\nlignite. I did not land on Mocha (latitude 38 degrees 20 minutes), but\r\nMr. Stokes brought me specimens of the grey, fine-grained, slightly\r\ncalcareous sandstone, precisely like that of Huafo, containing lignite\r\nand numerous Turritellae. The island is flat topped, 1,240 feet in\r\nheight, and appears like an outlier of the sedimentary beds on the\r\nmainland. The few shells collected consist of:—\r\n\r\n1. Turritella Chilensis, G.B. Sowerby (also at Huafo). 2. Fusus, very\r\nimperfect, somewhat resembling F. subreflexus of Navidad, but probably\r\ndifferent. 3. Venus, fragments of.\r\n\r\nCONCEPCION.\r\n\r\nSailing northward from Valdivia, the coast-cliffs are seen, first to\r\nassume near the R. Tolten, and thence for 150 miles northward, to be\r\ncontinued with the same mineralogical characters, immediately to be\r\ndescribed at Concepcion. I heard in many places of beds of lignite,\r\nsome of it fine and glossy, and likewise of silicified wood; near the\r\nTolten the cliffs are low, but they soon rise in height; and the\r\nhorizontal strata are prolonged, with a nearly level surface, until\r\ncoming to a more lofty tract between points Rumena and Lavapie. Here\r\nthe beds have been broken up by at least eight or nine parallel lines\r\nof elevation, ranging E. or E.N.E. and W. or W.S.W. These lines can be\r\nfollowed with the eye many miles into the interior; they are all\r\nuniclinal, the strata in each dipping to a point between S. and S.S.E.\r\nwith an inclination in the central lines of about forty degrees, and in\r\nthe outer ones of under twenty degrees. This band of symmetrically\r\ntroubled country is about eight miles in width.\r\n\r\nThe island of Quiriquina, in the Bay of Concepcion, is formed of\r\nvarious soft and often ferruginous sandstones, with bands of pebbles,\r\nand with the lower strata sometimes passing into a conglomerate resting\r\non the underlying metamorphic schists. These beds include subordinate\r\nlayers of greenish impure clay, soft micaceous and calcareous\r\nsandstones, and reddish friable earthy matter with white specks like\r\ndecomposed crystals of feldspar; they include, also, hard concretions,\r\nfragments of shells, lignite, and silicified wood. In the upper part\r\nthey pass into white, soft sediments and brecciolas, very like those\r\ndescribed at Chiloe; as indeed is the whole formation. At Lirguen and\r\nother places on the eastern side of the bay, there are good sections of\r\nthe lower sandstones, which are generally ferruginous, but which vary\r\nin character, and even pass into an argillaceous nature; they contain\r\nhard concretions, fragments of lignite, silicified wood, and pebbles\r\n(of the same rocks with the pebbles in the sandstones of Quiriquina),\r\nand they alternate with numerous, often very thin layers of imperfect\r\ncoal, generally of little specific gravity. The main bed here is three\r\nfeet thick; and only the coal of this one bed has a glossy fracture.\r\nAnother irregular, curvilinear bed of brown, compact lignite, is\r\nremarkable for being included in a mass of coarse gravel. These\r\nimperfect coals, when placed in a heap, ignite spontaneously. The\r\ncliffs on this side of the bay, as well as on the island of Quiriquina,\r\nare capped with red friable earth, which, as stated in the Second\r\nChapter, is of recent formation. The stratification in this\r\nneighbourhood is generally horizontal; but near Lirguen the beds dip\r\nN.W. at an angle of 23 degrees; near Concepcion they are also inclined:\r\nat the northern end of Quiriquina they have been tilted at an angle of\r\n30 degrees, and at the southern end at angles varying from 15 degrees\r\nto 40 degrees: these dislocations must have taken place under the sea.\r\n\r\nA collection of shells, from the island of Quiriquina, has been\r\ndescribed by M. d’Orbigny: they are all extinct, and from their generic\r\ncharacter, M. d’Orbigny inferred that they were of tertiary origin:\r\nthey consist of:—\r\n\r\n1. Scalaria Chilensis, d’Orbigny, “Voyage, Part Pal.” 2. Natica\r\nAraucana, d’Orbigny, “Voyage, Part Pal.” 3. Natica australis,\r\nd’Orbigny, “Voyage, Part Pal.” 4. Fusus difficilis, d’Orbigny, “Voyage,\r\nPart Pal.” 5. Pyrula longirostra, d’Orbigny, “Voyage, Part Pal.” 6.\r\nPleurotoma Araucana, d’Orbigny, “Voyage, Part Pal.” 7. Cardium auca,\r\nd’Orbigny, “Voyage, Part Pal.” 8. Cardium acuticostatum, d’Orbigny,\r\n“Voyage, Part Pal.” 9. Venus auca, d’Orbigny, “Voyage, Part Pal.” 10.\r\nMactra cecileana, d’Orbigny, “Voyage, Part Pal.” 11. Mactra Araucana,\r\nd’Orbigny, “Voyage, Part Pal.” 12. Arca Araucana, d’Orbigny, “Voyage,\r\nPart Pal.” 13. Nucula Largillierti, d’Orbigny, “Voyage, Part Pal.” 14.\r\nTrigonia Hanetiana, d’Orbigny, “Voyage, Part Pal.”\r\n\r\nDuring a second visit of the “Beagle” to Concepcion, Mr. Kent collected\r\nfor me some silicified wood and shells out of the concretions in the\r\nsandstone from Tome, situated a short distance north of Lirguen. They\r\nconsist of:—\r\n\r\n1. Natica australis, d’Orbigny, “Voyage, Part Pal.” 2. Mactra Araucana,\r\nd’Orbigny, “Voyage, Part Pal.” 3. Trigonia Hanetiana, d’Orbigny,\r\n“Voyage, Part Pal.” 4. Pecten, fragments of, probably two species, but\r\ntoo imperfect for description. 5. Baculites vagina, E. Forbes. 6.\r\nNautilus d’Orbignyanus, E. Forbes.\r\n\r\nBesides these shells, Captain Belcher found here an Ammonite, nearly\r\nthree feet in diameter, and so heavy that he could not bring it away;\r\nfragments are deposited at Haslar Hospital: he also found the\r\nsilicified vertebrae of some very large animal. (“Zoology of Captain\r\nBeechey’s Voyage” page 163.) From the identity in mineralogical nature\r\nof the rocks, and from Captain Belcher’s minute description of the\r\ncoast between Lirguen and Tome, the fossiliferous concretions at this\r\nlatter place certainly belong to the same formation with the beds\r\nexamined by myself at Lirguen; and these again are undoubtedly the same\r\nwith the strata of Quiriquina; moreover; the three first of the shells\r\nfrom Tome, though associated in the same concretions with the Baculite,\r\nare identical with the species from Quiriquina. Hence all the sandstone\r\nand lignitiferous beds in this neighbourhood certainly belong to the\r\nsame formation. Although the generic character of the Quiriquina\r\nfossils naturally led M. d’Orbigny to conceive that they were of\r\ntertiary origin, yet as we now find them associated with the Baculites\r\nvagina and with an Ammonite, we must, in the opinion of M. d’Orbigny,\r\nand if we are guided by the analogy of the northern hemisphere, rank\r\nthem in the Cretaceous system. Moreover, the Baculites vagina, which is\r\nin a tolerable state of preservation, appears to Professor E. Forbes\r\ncertainly to be identical with a species, so named by him, from\r\nPondicherry in India; where it is associated with numerous decidedly\r\ncretaceous species, which approach most nearly to Lower Greensand or\r\nNeocomian forms: this fact, considering the vast distance between Chile\r\nand India, is truly surprising. Again, the Nautilus d’Orbignyanus, as\r\nfar as its imperfect state allows of comparison, resembles, as I am\r\ninformed by Professor Forbes, both in its general form and in that of\r\nits chambers, two species from the Upper Greensand. It may be added\r\nthat every one of the above-named genera from Quiriquina, which have an\r\napparently tertiary character, are found in the Pondicherry strata.\r\nThere are, however, some difficulties on this view of the formations at\r\nConcepcion being cretaceous, which I shall afterwards allude to; and I\r\nwill here only state that the Cardium auca is found also at Coquimbo,\r\nthe beds at which place, there can be no doubt, are tertiary.\r\n\r\nNAVIDAD. (I was guided to this locality by the Report on M. Gay’s\r\n“Geological Researches” in the “Annales des Scienc. Nat.” 1st series\r\ntome 28.)\r\n\r\nThe Concepcion formation extends some distance northward, but how far I\r\nknow not; for the next point at which I landed was at Navidad, 160\r\nmiles north of Concepcion, and 60 miles south of Valparaiso. The cliffs\r\nhere are about eight hundred feet in height: they consist, wherever I\r\ncould examine them, of fine-grained, yellowish, earthy sandstones, with\r\nferruginous veins, and with concretions of hard calcareous sandstone.\r\nIn one part, there were many pebbles of the common metamorphic\r\nporphyries of the Cordillera: and near the base of the cliff, I\r\nobserved a single rounded boulder of greenstone, nearly a yard in\r\ndiameter. I traced this sandstone formation beneath the superficial\r\ncovering of gravel, for some distance inland: the strata are slightly\r\ninclined from the sea towards the Cordillera, which apparently has been\r\ncaused by their having been accumulated against or round outlying\r\nmasses of granite, of which some points project near the coast. The\r\nsandstone contains fragments of wood, either in the state of lignite or\r\npartially silicified, sharks’ teeth, and shells in great abundance,\r\nboth high up and low down the sea-cliffs. Pectunculus and Oliva were\r\nmost numerous in individuals, and next to them Turritella and Fusus. I\r\ncollected in a short time, though suffering from illness, the following\r\nthirty-one species, all of which are extinct, and several of the genera\r\ndo not now range (as we shall hereafter show) nearly so far south:—\r\n\r\n1. Gastridium cepa, G.B. Sowerby. 2. Monoceros, fragments of,\r\nconsidered by M. d’Orbigny as a new species. 3. Voluta alta, G.B.\r\nSowerby (considered by M. d’Orbigny as distinct from the V. alta of\r\nSanta Cruz). 4. Voluta triplicata, G.B. Sowerby. 5. Oliva dimidiata,\r\nG.B. Sowerby. 6. Pleurotoma discors, G.B. Sowerby. 7. Pleurotoma\r\nturbinelloides, G.B. Sowerby. 8. Fusus subreflexus, G.B. Sowerby. 9.\r\nFusus pyruliformis, G.B. Sowerby. 10. Fusus, allied to F. regularis\r\n(considered by M. d’Orbigny as a distinct species). 11. Turritella\r\nsuturalis, G.B. Sowerby. 12. Turritella Patagonica, G.B. Sowerby\r\n(fragments of). 13. Trochus laevis, G.B. Sowerby. 14. Trochus collaris,\r\nG.B. Sowerby (considered by M. d’Orbigny as the young of the T.\r\nlaevis). 15. Cassis monilifer, G.B. Sowerby. 16. Pyrula distans, G.B.\r\nSowerby. 17. Triton verruculosus, G.B. Sowerby. 18. Sigaretus\r\nsubglobosus, G.B. Sowerby. 19. Natica solida, G.B. Sowerby. (It is\r\ndoubtful whether the Natica solida of S. Cruz is the same species with\r\nthis.) 20. Terebra undulifera, G.B. Sowerby. 21. Terebra costellata,\r\nG.B. Sowerby. 22. Bulla (fragments of). 23. Dentalium giganteum, do.\r\n24. Dentalium sulcosum, do. 25. Corbis (?) laevigata, do. 26. Cardium\r\nmultiradiatum, do. 27. Venus meridionalis, do. 28. Pectunculus dispar,\r\n(?) Desh. (considered by M. d’Orbigny as a distinct species). 29, 30.\r\nCytheraea and Mactra, fragments of (considered by M. d’Orbigny as new\r\nspecies). 31. Pecten, fragments of.\r\n\r\nCOQUIMBO.\r\n(FIGURE 21. SECTION OF THE TERTIARY FORMATION AT COQUIMBO.\r\n\r\nFrom Level of Sea to Surface of plain, 252 feet above sea, through\r\nlevels F, E, D and C:\r\n\r\nF.—Lower sandstone, with concretions and silicified bones, with fossil\r\nshells, all, or nearly all, extinct.\r\n\r\nE.—Upper ferruginous sandstone, with numerous Balani, with fossil\r\nshells, all, or nearly all, extinct.\r\n\r\nC and D.—Calcareous beds with recent shells.\r\n\r\nA.—Stratified sand in a ravine, also with recent shells.)\r\n\r\nFor more than two hundred miles northward of Navidad, the coast\r\nconsists of plutonic and metamorphic rocks, with the exception of some\r\nquite insignificant superficial beds of recent origin. At Tonguay,\r\ntwenty-five miles south of Coquimbo, tertiary beds recommence. I have\r\nalready minutely described in the Second Chapter, the step-formed\r\nplains of Coquimbo, and the upper calcareous beds (from twenty to\r\nthirty feet in thickness) containing shells of recent species, but in\r\ndifferent proportions from those on the beach. There remains to be\r\ndescribed only the underlying ancient tertiary beds, represented in\r\nFigure 21 by the letters F and E:—\r\n\r\nI obtained good sections of bed F only in Herradura Bay: it consists of\r\nsoft whitish sandstone, with ferruginous veins, some pebbles of\r\ngranite, and concretionary layers of hard calcareous sandstone. These\r\nconcretions are remarkable from the great number of large silicified\r\nbones, apparently of cetaceous animals, which they contain; and\r\nlikewise of a shark’s teeth, closely resembling those of the Carcharias\r\nmegalodon. Shells of the following species, of which the gigantic\r\nOyster and Perna are the most conspicuous, are numerously embedded in\r\nthe concretions:—\r\n\r\n1. Bulla ambigua, d’Orbigny “Voyage” Pal. 2. Monoceros Blainvillii,\r\nd’Orbigny “Voyage” Pal. 3. Cardium auca, d’Orbigny “Voyage” Pal. 4.\r\nPanopaea Coquimbensis, d’Orbigny “Voyage” Pal. 5. Perna Gaudichaudi,\r\nd’Orbigny “Voyage” Pal. 6. Artemis ponderosa; Mr. Sowerby can find no\r\ndistinguishing character between this fossil and the recent A.\r\nponderosa; it is certainly an Artemis, as shown by the pallial\r\nimpression. 7. Ostrea Patagonica (?); Mr. Sowerby can point out no\r\ndistinguishing character between this species and that so eminently\r\ncharacteristic of the great Patagonian formation; but he will not\r\npretend to affirm that they are identical. 8. Fragments of a Venus and\r\nNatica.\r\n\r\nThe cliffs on one side of Herradura Bay are capped by a mass of\r\nstratified shingle, containing a little calcareous matter, and I did\r\nnot doubt that it belonged to the same recent formation with the gravel\r\non the surrounding plains, also cemented by calcareous matter, until to\r\nmy surprise, I found in the midst of it, a single thin layer almost\r\nentirely composed of the above gigantic oyster.\r\n\r\nAt a little distance inland, I obtained several sections of the bed E,\r\nwhich, though different in appearance from the lower bed F, belongs to\r\nthe same formation: it consists of a highly ferruginous sandy mass,\r\nalmost composed, like the lowest bed at Port S. Julian, of fragments of\r\nBalanidae; it includes some pebbles, and layers of yellowish-brown\r\nmudstone. The embedded shells consist of:—\r\n\r\n1. Monoceros Blainvillii, d’Orbigny “Voyage” Pal. 2. Monoceros\r\nambiguus, G.B. Sowerby. 3. Anomia alternans, G.B. Sowerby. 4. Pecten\r\nrudis, G.B. Sowerby. 5. Perna Gaudichaudi, d’Orbigny “Voyage” Pal. 6.\r\nOstrea Patagonica (?), d’Orbigny “Voyage” Pal. 7. Ostrea, small\r\nspecies, in imperfect state; it appeared to me like a small kind now\r\nliving in, but very rare in the bay. 8. Mytilus Chiloensis; Mr. Sowerby\r\ncan find no distinguishing character between this fossil, as far as its\r\nnot very perfect condition allows of comparison, and the recent\r\nspecies. 9. Balanus Coquimbensis, G.B. Sowerby. 10. Balanus psittacus?\r\nKing. This appears to Mr. Sowerby and myself identical with a very\r\nlarge and common species now living on the coast.\r\n\r\nThe uppermost layers of this ferrugino-sandy mass are conformably\r\ncovered by, and impregnated to the depth of several inches with, the\r\ncalcareous matter of the bed D called losa: hence I at one time\r\nimagined that there was a gradual passage between them; but as all the\r\nspecies are recent in the bed D, whilst the most characteristic shells\r\nof the uppermost layers of E are the extinct Perna, Pecten, and\r\nMonoceros, I agree with M. d’Orbigny, that this view is erroneous, and\r\nthat there is only a mineralogical passage between them, and no gradual\r\ntransition in the nature of their organic remains. Besides the fourteen\r\nspecies enumerated from these two lower beds, M. d’Orbigny has\r\ndescribed ten other species given to him from this locality; namely:—\r\n\r\n1. Fusus Cleryanus, d’Orbigny “Voyage” Pal. 2. Fusus petitianus,\r\nd’Orbigny “Voyage” Pal. 3. Venus hanetiana, d’Orbigny “Voyage” Pal. 4.\r\nVenus incerta (?) d’Orbigny “Voyage” Pal. 5. Venus Cleryana, d’Orbigny\r\n“Voyage” Pal. 6. Venus petitiana, d’Orbigny “Voyage” Pal. 7. Venus\r\nChilensis, d’Orbigny “Voyage” Pal. 8. Solecurtus hanetianus, d’Orbigny\r\n“Voyage” Pal. 9. Mactra auca, d’Orbigny “Voyage” Pal. 10. Oliva serena,\r\nd’Orbigny “Voyage” Pal.\r\n\r\nOf these twenty-four shells, all are extinct, except, according to Mr.\r\nSowerby, the Artemis ponderosa, Mytilus Chiloensis, and probably the\r\ngreat Balanus.\r\n\r\nCOQUIMBO TO COPIAPO.\r\n\r\nA few miles north of Coquimbo, I met with the ferruginous, balaniferous\r\nmass E with many silicified bones; I was informed that these silicified\r\nbones occur also at Tonguay, south of Coquimbo: their number is\r\ncertainly remarkable, and they seem to take the place of the silicified\r\nwood, so common on the coast-formations of Southern Chile. In the\r\nvalley of Chaneral, I again saw this same formation, capped with the\r\nrecent calcareous beds. I here left the coast, and did not see any more\r\nof the tertiary formations, until descending to the sea at Copiapo:\r\nhere in one place I found variously coloured layers of sand and soft\r\nsandstone, with seams of gypsum, and in another place, a comminuted\r\nshelly mass, with layers of rotten-stone and seams of gypsum, including\r\nmany of the extinct gigantic oyster: beds with these oysters are said\r\nto occur at English Harbour, a few miles north of Copiapo.\r\n\r\nCOAST OF PERU.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of deposits containing recent shells and of quite\r\ninsignificant dimensions, no tertiary formations have been observed on\r\nthis coast, for a space of twenty-two degrees of latitude north of\r\nCopiapo, until coming to Payta, where there is said to be a\r\nconsiderable calcareous deposit: a few fossils have been described by\r\nM. d’Orbigny from this place, namely:—\r\n\r\n1. Rostellaria Gaudichaudi, d’Orbigny “Voyage” Pal. 2. Pectunculus\r\nPaytensis, d’Orbigny “Voyage” Pal. 3. Venus petitiana, d’Orbigny\r\n“Voyage” Pal. 4. Ostrea Patagonica? This great oyster (of which\r\nspecimens have been given me) cannot be distinguished by Mr. Sowerby\r\nfrom some of the varieties from Patagonia; though it would be hazardous\r\nto assert it is the same with that species, or with that from Coquimbo.\r\n\r\nCONCLUDING REMARKS.\r\n\r\nThe formations described in this chapter, have, in the case of Chiloe\r\nand probably in that of Concepcion and Navidad, apparently been\r\naccumulated in troughs formed by submarine ridges extending parallel to\r\nthe ancient shores of the continent; in the case of the islands of\r\nMocha and Huafo it is highly probable, and in that of Ypun and Lemus\r\nalmost certain, that they were accumulated round isolated rocky centres\r\nor nuclei, in the same manner as mud and sand are now collecting round\r\nthe outlying islets and reefs in the West Indian Archipelago. Hence, I\r\nmay remark, it does not follow that the outlying tertiary masses of\r\nMocha and Huafo were ever continuously united at the same level with\r\nthe formations on the mainland, though they may have been of\r\ncontemporaneous origin, and been subsequently upraised to the same\r\nheight. In the more northern parts of Chile, the tertiary strata seem\r\nto have been separately accumulated in bays, now forming the mouths of\r\nvalleys.\r\n\r\nThe relation between these several deposits on the shores of the\r\nPacific, is not nearly so clear as in the case of the tertiary\r\nformations on the Atlantic. Judging from the form and height of the\r\nland (evidence which I feel sure is here much more trustworthy than it\r\ncan ever be in such broken continents as that of Europe), from the\r\nidentity of mineralogical composition, from the presence of fragments\r\nof lignite and of silicified wood, and from the intercalated layers of\r\nimperfect coal, I must believe that the coast-formations from Central\r\nChiloe to Concepcion, a distance of 400 miles, are of the same age:\r\nfrom nearly similar reasons, I suspect that the beds of Mocha, Huafo,\r\nand Ypun, belong also to the same period. The commonest shell in Mocha\r\nand Huafo is the same species of Turritella; and I believe the same\r\nCytheraea is found on the islands of Huafo, Chiloe, and Ypun; but with\r\nthese trifling exceptions, the few organic remains found at these\r\nplaces are distinct. The numerous shells from Navidad, with the\r\nexception of two, namely, the Sigaretus and Turritella found at Ypun,\r\nare likewise distinct from those found in any other part of this coast.\r\nCoquimbo has Cardium auca in common with Concepcion, and Fusus\r\nCleryanus with Huafo; I may add, that Coquimbo has Venus petitiana, and\r\na gigantic oyster (said by M. d’Orbigny also to be found a little south\r\nof Concepcion) in common with Payta, though this latter place is\r\nsituated twenty-two degrees northward of latitude 27 degrees, to which\r\npoint the Coquimbo formation extends.\r\n\r\nFrom these facts, and from the generic resemblance of the fossils from\r\nthe different localities, I cannot avoid the suspicion that they all\r\nbelong to nearly the same epoch, which epoch, as we shall immediately\r\nsee, must be a very ancient tertiary one. But as the Baculite,\r\nespecially considering its apparent identity with the Cretaceous\r\nPondicherry species, and the presence of an Ammonite, and the\r\nresemblance of the Nautilus to two upper greensand species, together\r\nafford very strong evidence that the formation of Concepcion is a\r\nSecondary one; I will, in my remarks on the fossils from the other\r\nlocalities, put on one side those from Concepcion and from Eastern\r\nChiloe, which, whatever their age may be, appear to me to belong to one\r\ngroup. I must, however, again call attention to the fact that the\r\nCardium auca is found both at Concepcion and in the undoubtedly\r\ntertiary strata of Coquimbo: nor should the possibility be overlooked,\r\nthat as Trigonia, though known in the northern hemisphere only as a\r\nSecondary genus, has living representatives in the Australian seas, so\r\na Baculite, Ammonite, and Trigonia may have survived in this remote\r\npart of the southern ocean to a somewhat later period than to the north\r\nof the equator.\r\n\r\nBefore passing in review the fossils from the other localities, there\r\nare two points, with respect to the formations between Concepcion and\r\nChiloe, which deserve some notice. First, that though the strata are\r\ngenerally horizontal, they have been upheaved in Chiloe in a set of\r\nparallel anticlinal and uniclinal lines ranging north and south,—in the\r\ndistrict near P. Rumena by eight or nine far-extended, most\r\nsymmetrical, uniclinal lines ranging nearly east and west,—and in the\r\nneighbourhood of Concepcion by less regular single lines, directed both\r\nN.E. and S.W., and N.W. and S.E. This fact is of some interest, as\r\nshowing that within a period which cannot be considered as very ancient\r\nin relation to the history of the continent, the strata between the\r\nCordillera and the Pacific have been broken up in the same variously\r\ndirected manner as have the old plutonic and metamorphic rocks in this\r\nsame district. The second point is, that the sandstone between\r\nConcepcion and Southern Chiloe is everywhere lignitiferous, and\r\nincludes much silicified wood; whereas the formations in Northern Chile\r\ndo not include beds of lignite or coal, and in place of the fragments\r\nof silicified wood there are silicified bones. Now, at the present day,\r\nfrom Cape Horn to near Concepcion, the land is entirely concealed by\r\nforests, which thin out at Concepcion, and in Central and Northern\r\nChile entirely disappear. This coincidence in the distribution of the\r\nfossil wood and the living forests may be quite accidental; but I\r\nincline to take a different view of it; for, as the difference in\r\nclimate, on which the presence of forests depends, is here obviously in\r\nchief part due to the form of the land, and as the Cordillera\r\nundoubtedly existed when the lignitiferous beds were accumulating, I\r\nconceive it is not improbable that the climate, during the\r\nlignitiferous period, varied on different parts of the coast in a\r\nsomewhat similar manner as it now does. Looking to an earlier epoch,\r\nwhen the strata of the Cordillera were depositing, there were islands\r\nwhich even in the latitude of Northern Chile, where now all is\r\nirreclaimably desert, supported large coniferous forests.\r\n\r\nTABLE 4.\r\n\r\nColumn 1.

Of these fifty-nine species only an Artemis, a\r\nMytilus and Balanus, all from Coquimbo, are (in the opinion of Mr.\r\nSowerby, but not in that of M. d’Orbigny) identical with living shells;\r\nand it would certainly require a better series of specimens to render\r\nthis conclusion certain. Only the Turritella Chilensis from Huafo and\r\nMocha, the T. Patagonica and Venus meridionalis from Navidad, come very\r\nnear to recent South American shells, namely, the two Turritellas to T.\r\ncingulata, and the Venus to V. exalbida: some few other species come\r\nrather less near; and some few resemble forms in the older European\r\ntertiary deposits: none of the species resemble secondary forms. Hence\r\nI conceive there can be no doubt that these formations are tertiary,—a\r\npoint necessary to consider, after the case of Concepcion. The\r\nfifty-nine species belong to thirty-two genera; of these, Gastridium is\r\nextinct, and three or four of the genera (viz. Panopaea, Rostellaria,\r\nCorbis (?), and I believe Solecurtus) are not now found on the west\r\ncoast of South America. Fifteen of the genera have on this coast living\r\nrepresentatives in about the same latitudes with the fossil species;\r\nbut twelve genera now range very differently to what they formerly did.\r\nThe idea of Table 4, in which the difference between the extension in\r\nlatitude of the fossil and existing species is shown, is taken from M.\r\nd’Orbigny’s work; but the range of the living shells is given on the\r\nauthority of Mr. Cuming, whose long-continued researches on the\r\nconchology of South America are well-known.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider that very few, if any, of the fifty-nine fossil shells\r\nare identical with, or make any close approach to, living species; when\r\nwe consider that some of the genera do not now exist on the west coast\r\nof South America, and that no less than twelve genera out of the\r\nthirty-two formerly ranged very differently from the existing species\r\nof the same genera, we must admit that these deposits are of\r\nconsiderable antiquity, and that they probably verge on the\r\ncommencement of the tertiary era. May we not venture to believe, that\r\nthey are of nearly contemporaneous origin with the Eocene formations of\r\nthe northern hemisphere?\r\n\r\nComparing the fossil remains from the coast of Chile (leaving out, as\r\nbefore, Concepcion and Chiloe) with those from Patagonia, we may\r\nconclude, from their generic resemblance, and from the small number of\r\nthe species which from either coast approach closely to living forms,\r\nthat the formations of both belong to nearly the same epoch; and this\r\nis the opinion of M. D’Orbigny. Had not a single fossil shell been\r\ncommon to the two coasts, it could not have been argued that the\r\nformations belonged to different ages; for Messrs. Cuming and Hinds\r\nhave found, on the comparison of nearly two thousand living species\r\nfrom the opposite sides of South America, only one in common, namely,\r\nthe Purpura lapillus from both sides of the Isthmus of Panama: even the\r\nshells collected by myself amongst the Chonos Islands and on the coast\r\nof Patagonia, are dissimilar, and we must descend to the apex of the\r\ncontinent, to Tierra del Fuego, to find these two great conchological\r\nprovinces united into one. Hence it is remarkable that four or five of\r\nthe fossil shells from Navidad, namely, Voluta alta, Turritella\r\nPatagonica, Trochus collaris, Venus meridionalis, perhaps Natica\r\nsolida, and perhaps the large oyster from Coquimbo, are considered by\r\nMr. Sowerby as identical with species from Santa Cruz and P. Desire. M.\r\nd’Orbigny, however, admits the perfect identity only of the Trochus.\r\n\r\nON THE TEMPERATURE OF THE TERTIARY PERIOD.\r\n\r\nAs the number of the fossil species and genera from the western and\r\neastern coasts is considerable, it will be interesting to consider the\r\nprobable nature of the climate under which they lived. We will first\r\ntake the case of Navidad, in latitude 34 degrees, where thirty-one\r\nspecies were collected, and which, as we shall presently see, must have\r\ninhabited shallow water, and therefore will necessarily well exhibit\r\nthe effects of temperature. Referring to Table 4 we find that the\r\nexisting species of the genera Cassis, Pyrula, Pleurotoma, Terebra, and\r\nSigaretus, which are generally (though by no means invariably)\r\ncharacteristic of warmer latitudes, do not at the present day range\r\nnearly so far south on this line of coast as the fossil species\r\nformerly did. Including Coquimbo, we have Perna in the same\r\npredicament. The first impression from this fact is, that the climate\r\nmust formerly have been warmer than it now is; but we must be very\r\ncautious in admitting this, for Cardium, Bulla, and Fusus (and, if we\r\ninclude Coquimbo, Anomia and Artemis) likewise formerly ranged farther\r\nsouth than they now do; and as these genera are far from being\r\ncharacteristic of hot climates, their former greater southern range may\r\nwell have been owing to causes quite distinct from climate: Voluta,\r\nagain, though generally so tropical a genus, is at present confined on\r\nthe west coast to colder or more southern latitudes than it was during\r\nthe tertiary period. The Trochus collaris, moreover, and, as we have\r\njust seen according to Mr. Sowerby, two or three other species,\r\nformerly ranged from Navidad as far south as Santa Cruz in latitude 50\r\ndegrees. If, instead of comparing the fossils of Navidad, as we have\r\nhitherto done, with the shells now living on the west coast of South\r\nAmerica, we compare them with those found in other parts of the world,\r\nunder nearly similar latitudes; for instance, in the southern parts of\r\nthe Mediterranean or of Australia, there is no evidence that the sea\r\noff Navidad was formerly hotter than what might have been expected from\r\nits latitude, even if it was somewhat warmer than it now is when cooled\r\nby the great southern polar current. Several of the most tropical\r\ngenera have no representative fossils at Navidad; and there are only\r\nsingle species of Cassis, Pyrula, and Sigaretus, two of Pleurotoma and\r\ntwo of Terebra, but none of these species are of conspicuous size. In\r\nPatagonia, there is even still less evidence in the character of the\r\nfossils, of the climate having been formerly warmer. (It may be worth\r\nwhile to mention that the shells living at the present day on this\r\neastern side of South America, in latitude 40 degrees, have perhaps a\r\nmore tropical character than those in corresponding latitudes on the\r\nshores of Europe: for at Bahia Blanca and S. Blas, there are two fine\r\nspecies of Voluta and four of Oliva.) As from the various reasons\r\nalready assigned, there can be little doubt that the formations of\r\nPatagonia and at least of Navidad and Coquimbo in Chile, are the\r\nequivalents of an ancient stage in the tertiary formations of the\r\nnorthern hemisphere, the conclusion that the climate of the southern\r\nseas at this period was not hotter than what might have been expected\r\nfrom the latitude of each place, appears to me highly important; for we\r\nmust believe, in accordance with the views of Mr. Lyell, that the\r\ncauses which gave to the older tertiary productions of the quite\r\ntemperate zones of Europe a tropical character, WERE OF A LOCAL\r\nCHARACTER AND DID NOT AFFECT THE ENTIRE GLOBE. On the other hand, I\r\nhave endeavoured to show, in the “Geological Transactions,” that, at a\r\nmuch later period, Europe and North and South America were nearly\r\ncontemporaneously subjected to ice- action, and consequently to a\r\ncolder, or at least more equable, climate than that now characteristic\r\nof the same latitudes.\r\n\r\nON THE ABSENCE OF EXTENSIVE MODERN CONCHIFEROUS DEPOSITS IN SOUTH\r\nAMERICA; AND ON THE CONTEMPORANEOUSNESS OF THE OLDER TERTIARY DEPOSITS\r\nAT DISTANT POINTS BEING DUE TO CONTEMPORANEOUS MOVEMENTS OF SUBSIDENCE.\r\n\r\nKnowing from the researches of Professor E. Forbes, that molluscous\r\nanimals chiefly abound within a depth of 100 fathoms and under, and\r\nbearing in mind how many thousand miles of both coasts of South America\r\nhave been upraised within the recent period by a slow, long-continued,\r\nintermittent movement,—seeing the diversity in nature of the shores and\r\nthe number of shells now living on them,—seeing also that the sea off\r\nPatagonia and off many parts of Chile, was during the tertiary period\r\nhighly favourable to the accumulation of sediment,—the absence of\r\nextensive deposits including recent shells over these vast spaces of\r\ncoast is highly remarkable. The conchiferous calcareous beds at\r\nCoquimbo, and at a few isolated points northward, offer the most marked\r\nexception to this statement; for these beds are from twenty to thirty\r\nfeet in thickness, and they stretch for some miles along shore,\r\nattaining, however, only a very trifling breadth. At Valdivia there is\r\nsome sandstone with imperfect casts of shells, which POSSIBLY may\r\nbelong to the recent period: parts of the boulder formation and the\r\nshingle-beds on the lower plains of Patagonia probably belong to this\r\nsame period, but neither are fossiliferous: it also so happens that the\r\ngreat Pampean formation does not include, with the exception of the\r\nAzara, any mollusca. There cannot be the smallest doubt that the\r\nupraised shells along the shores of the Atlantic and Pacific, whether\r\nlying on the bare surface, or embedded in mould or in sand-hillocks,\r\nwill in the course of ages be destroyed by alluvial action: this\r\nprobably will be the case even with the calcareous beds of Coquimbo, so\r\nliable to dissolution by rain-water. If we take into consideration the\r\nprobability of oscillations of level and the consequent action of the\r\ntidal-waves at different heights, their destruction will appear almost\r\ncertain. Looking to an epoch as far distant in futurity as we now are\r\nfrom the past Miocene period, there seems to me scarcely a chance,\r\nunder existing conditions, of the numerous shells now living in those\r\nzones of depths most fertile in life, and found exclusively on the\r\nwestern and south-eastern coasts of South America, being preserved to\r\nthis imaginary distant epoch. A whole conchological series will in time\r\nbe swept away, with no memorials of their existence preserved in the\r\nearth’s crust.\r\n\r\nCan any light be thrown on this remarkable absence of recent\r\nconchiferous deposits on these coasts, on which, at an ancient tertiary\r\nepoch, strata abounding with organic remains were extensively\r\naccumulated? I think there can, namely, by considering the conditions\r\nnecessary for the preservation of a formation to a distant age. Looking\r\nto the enormous amount of denudation which on all sides of us has been\r\neffected,—as evidenced by the lofty cliffs cutting off on so many\r\ncoasts horizontal and once far-extended strata of no great antiquity\r\n(as in the case of Patagonia),—as evidenced by the level surface of the\r\nground on both sides of great faults and dislocations,—by inland lines\r\nof escarpments, by outliers, and numberless other facts, and by that\r\nargument of high generality advanced by Mr. Lyell, namely, that every\r\nSEDIMENTARY formation, whatever its thickness may be, and over however\r\nmany hundred square miles it may extend, is the result and the measure\r\nof an equal amount of wear and tear of pre-existing formations;\r\nconsidering these facts, we must conclude that, as an ordinary rule, a\r\nformation to resist such vast destroying powers, and to last to a\r\ndistant epoch, must be of wide extent, and either in itself, or\r\ntogether with superincumbent strata, be of great thickness. In this\r\ndiscussion, we are considering only formations containing the remains\r\nof marine animals, which, as before mentioned, live, with some\r\nexceptions within (most of them much within) depths of 100 fathoms.\r\nHow, then, can a thick and widely extended formation be accumulated,\r\nwhich shall include such organic remains? First, let us take the case\r\nof the bed of the sea long remaining at a stationary level: under these\r\ncircumstances it is evident that CONCHIFEROUS strata can accumulate\r\nonly to the same thickness with the depth at which the shells can live;\r\non gently inclined coasts alone can they accumulate to any considerable\r\nwidth; and from the want of superincumbent pressure, it is probable\r\nthat the sedimentary matter will seldom be much consolidated: such\r\nformations have no very good chance, when in the course of time they\r\nare upraised, of long resisting the powers of denudation. The chance\r\nwill be less if the submarine surface, instead of having remained\r\nstationary, shall have gone on slowly rising during the deposition of\r\nthe strata, for in this case their total thickness must be less, and\r\neach part, before being consolidated or thickly covered up by\r\nsuperincumbent matter, will have had successively to pass through the\r\nordeal of the beach; and on most coasts, the waves on the beach tend to\r\nwear down and disperse every object exposed to their action. Now, both\r\non the south-eastern and western shores of South America, we have had\r\nclear proofs that the land has been slowly rising, and in the long\r\nlines of lofty cliffs, we have seen that the tendency of the sea is\r\nalmost everywhere to eat into the land. Considering these facts, it\r\nceases, I think, to be surprising, that extensive recent conchiferous\r\ndeposits are entirely absent on the southern and western shores of\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nLet us take the one remaining case, of the bed of the sea slowly\r\nsubsiding during a length of time, whilst sediment has gone on being\r\ndeposited. It is evident that strata might thus accumulate to any\r\nthickness, each stratum being deposited in shallow water, and\r\nconsequently abounding with those shells which cannot live at great\r\ndepths: the pressure, also, I may observe, of each fresh bed would aid\r\nin consolidating all the lower ones. Even on a rather steep coast,\r\nthough such must ever be unfavourable to widely extended deposits, the\r\nformations would always tend to increase in breadth from the water\r\nencroaching on the land. Hence we may admit that periods of slow\r\nsubsidence will commonly be most favourable to the accumulation of\r\nCONCHIFEROUS deposits, of sufficient thickness, extension, and\r\nhardness, to resist the average powers of denudation.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that at an ancient tertiary epoch, fossiliferous deposits\r\nwere extensively deposited on the coasts of South America; and it is a\r\nvery interesting fact, that there is evidence that these ancient\r\ntertiary beds were deposited during a period of subsidence. Thus, at\r\nNavidad, the strata are about eight hundred feet in thickness, and the\r\nfossil shells are abundant both at the level of the sea and some way up\r\nthe cliffs; having sent a list of these fossils to Professor E. Forbes,\r\nhe thinks they must have lived in water between one and ten fathoms in\r\ndepth: hence the bottom of the sea on which these shells once lived\r\nmust have subsided at least 700 feet to allow of the superincumbent\r\nmatter being deposited. I must here remark, that, as all these and the\r\nfollowing fossil shells are extinct species, Professor Forbes\r\nnecessarily judges of the depths at which they lived only from their\r\ngeneric character, and from the analogical distribution of shells in\r\nthe northern hemisphere; but there is no just cause from this to doubt\r\nthe general results. At Huafo the strata are about the same thickness,\r\nnamely, 800 feet, and Professor Forbes thinks the fossils found there\r\ncannot have lived at a greater depth than fifty fathoms, or 300 feet.\r\nThese two points, namely, Navidad and Huafo, are 570 miles apart, but\r\nnearly halfway between them lies Mocha, an island 1,200 feet in height,\r\napparently formed of tertiary strata up to its level summit, and with\r\nmany shells, including the same Turritella with that found at Huafo,\r\nembedded close to the level of the sea. In Patagonia, shells are\r\nnumerous at Santa Cruz, at the foot of the 350 feet plain, which has\r\ncertainly been formed by the denudation of the 840 feet plain, and\r\ntherefore was originally covered by strata that number of feet in\r\nthickness, and these shells, according to Professor Forbes, probably\r\nlived at a depth of between seven and fifteen fathoms: at Port S.\r\nJulian, sixty miles to the north, shells are numerous at the foot of\r\nthe ninety feet plain (formed by the denudation of the 950 feet plain),\r\nand likewise occasionally at the height of several hundred feet in the\r\nupper strata; these shells must have lived in water somewhere between\r\nfive and fifty fathoms in depth. Although in other parts of Patagonia I\r\nhave no direct evidence of shoal-water shells having been buried under\r\na great thickness of superincumbent submarine strata, yet it should be\r\nborne in mind that the lower fossiliferous strata with several of the\r\nsame species of Mollusca, the upper tufaceous beds, and the high\r\nsummit-plain, stretch for a considerable distance southward, and for\r\nhundreds of miles northward; seeing this uniformity of structure, I\r\nconceive it may be fairly concluded that the subsidence by which the\r\nshells at Santa Cruz and S. Julian were carried down and covered up,\r\nwas not confined to these two points, but was co-extensive with a\r\nconsiderable portion of the Patagonian tertiary formation. In a\r\nsucceeding chapter it will be seen, that we are led to a similar\r\nconclusion with respect to the secondary fossiliferous strata of the\r\nCordillera, namely, that they also were deposited during a long-\r\ncontinued and great period of subsidence. From the foregoing reasoning,\r\nand from the facts just given, I think we must admit the probability of\r\nthe following proposition: namely, that when the bed of the sea is\r\neither stationary or rising, circumstances are far less favourable,\r\nthan when the level is sinking, to the accumulation of CONCHIFEROUS\r\ndeposits of sufficient thickness and extension to resist, when\r\nupheaved, the average vast amount of denudation. This result appears to\r\nme, in several respects, very interesting: every one is at first\r\ninclined to believe that at innumerable points, wherever there is a\r\nsupply of sediment, fossiliferous strata are now forming, which at some\r\nfuture distant epoch will be upheaved and preserved; but on the views\r\nabove given, we must conclude that this is far from being the case; on\r\nthe contrary, we require (1st), a long-continued supply of sediment;\r\n(2nd), an extensive shallow area; and (3rd), that this area shall\r\nslowly subside to a great depth, so as to admit the accumulation of a\r\nwidely extended thick mass of superincumbent strata. In how few parts\r\nof the world, probably, do these conditions at the present day concur!\r\nWe can thus, also, understand the general want of that close sequence\r\nin fossiliferous formations which we might theoretically have\r\nanticipated; for, without we suppose a subsiding movement to go on at\r\nthe same spot during an enormous period, from one geological era to\r\nanother, and during the whole of this period sediment to accumulate at\r\nthe proper rate, so that the depth should not become too great for the\r\ncontinued existence of molluscous animals, it is scarcely possible that\r\nthere should be a perfect sequence at the same spot in the fossil\r\nshells of the two geological formations. (Professor H.D. Rogers, in his\r\nexcellent address to the Association of American Geologists\r\n(“Silliman’s Journal” volume 47 page 277) makes the following remark:\r\n“I question if we are at all aware how COMPLETELY the whole history of\r\nall departed time lies indelibly recorded with the amplest minuteness\r\nof detail in the successive sediments of the globe, how effectually, in\r\nother words, every period of time HAS WRITTEN ITS OWN HISTORY,\r\ncarefully preserving every created form and every trace of action.” I\r\nthink the correctness of such remarks is more than doubtful, even if we\r\nexcept (as I suppose he would) all those numerous organic forms which\r\ncontain no hard parts.) So far from a very long-continued subsidence\r\nbeing probable, many facts lead to the belief that the earth’s surface\r\noscillates up and down; and we have seen that during the elevatory\r\nmovements there is but a small chance of DURABLE fossiliferous deposits\r\naccumulating.\r\n\r\nLastly, these same considerations appear to throw some light on the\r\nfact that certain periods appear to have been favourable to the\r\ndeposition, or at least to the preservation, of contemporaneous\r\nformations at very distant points. We have seen that in South America\r\nan enormous area has been rising within the recent period; and in other\r\nquarters of the globe immense spaces appear to have risen\r\ncontemporaneously. From my examination of the coral- reefs of the great\r\noceans, I have been led to conclude that the bed of the sea has gone on\r\nslowly sinking within the present era, over truly vast areas: this,\r\nindeed, is in itself probable, from the simple fact of the rising areas\r\nhaving been so large. In South America we have distinct evidence that\r\nat nearly the same tertiary period, the bed of the sea off parts of the\r\ncoast of Chile and off Patagonia was sinking, though these regions are\r\nvery remote from each other. If, then, it holds good, as a general\r\nrule, that in the same quarter of the globe the earth’s crust tends to\r\nsink and rise contemporaneously over vast spaces, we can at once see,\r\nthat we have at distant points, at the same period, those very\r\nconditions which appear to be requisite for the accumulation of\r\nfossiliferous masses of sufficient extension, thickness, and hardness,\r\nto resist denudation, and consequently to last unto an epoch distant in\r\nfuturity. (Professor Forbes has some admirable remarks on this subject,\r\nin his “Report on the Shells of the Aegean Sea.” In a letter to Mr.\r\nMaclaren (“Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal” January 1843), I\r\npartially entered into this discussion, and endeavoured to show that it\r\nwas highly improbable, that upraised atolls or barrier-reefs, though of\r\ngreat thickness, should, owing to their small extension or breadth, be\r\npreserved to a distant future period.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\nPLUTONIC AND METAMORPHIC ROCKS:—CLEAVAGE AND FOLIATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nBrazil, Bahia, gneiss with disjointed metamorphosed dikes.—Strike of\r\nfoliation.—Rio de Janeiro, gneiss-granite, embedded fragment in,\r\ndecomposition of.—La Plata, metamorphic and old volcanic rocks of.—S.\r\nVentana.—Claystone porphyry formation of Patagonia; singular\r\nmetamorphic rocks; pseudo-dikes.—Falkland Islands, Palaeozoic fossils\r\nof.—Tierra del Fuego, clay-slate formation, cretaceous fossils of;\r\ncleavage and foliation; form of land.—Chonos Archipelago, mica-schists,\r\nfoliation disturbed by granitic axis; dikes.—Chiloe.—Concepcion, dikes,\r\nsuccessive formation of.—Central and Northern Chile.—Concluding remarks\r\non cleavage and foliation.—Their close analogy and similar\r\norigin.—Stratification of metamorphic schists.—Foliation of intrusive\r\nrocks.—Relation of cleavage and foliation to the lines of tension\r\nduring metamorphosis.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe metamorphic and plutonic formations of the several districts\r\nvisited by the “Beagle” will be here chiefly treated of, but only such\r\ncases as appear to me new, or of some special interest, will be\r\ndescribed in detail; at the end of the chapter I will sum up all the\r\nfacts on cleavage and foliation,— to which I particularly attended.\r\n\r\nBAHIA, BRAZIL: latitude 13 degrees south.\r\n\r\nThe prevailing rock is gneiss, often passing, by the disappearance of\r\nthe quartz and mica, and by the feldspar losing its red colour, into a\r\nbrilliantly grey primitive greenstone. Not unfrequently quartz and\r\nhornblende are arranged in layers in almost amorphous feldspar. There\r\nis some fine-grained syenitic granite, orbicularly marked by\r\nferruginous lines, and weathering into vertical, cylindrical holes,\r\nalmost touching each other. In the gneiss, concretions of granular\r\nfeldspar and others of garnets with mica occur. The gneiss is traversed\r\nby numerous dikes composed of black, finely crystallised, hornblendic\r\nrock, containing a little glassy feldspar and sometimes mica, and\r\nvarying in thickness from mere threads to ten feet: these threads,\r\nwhich are often curvilinear, could sometimes be traced running into the\r\nlarger dikes. One of these dikes was remarkable from having been in two\r\nor three places laterally disjointed, with unbroken gneiss interposed\r\nbetween the broken ends, and in one part with a portion of the gneiss\r\ndriven, apparently whilst in a softened state, into its side or wall.\r\nIn several neighbouring places, the gneiss included angular, well-\r\ndefined, sometimes bent, masses of hornblende rock, quite like, except\r\nin being more perfectly crystallised, that forming the dikes, and, at\r\nleast in one instance, containing (as determined by Professor Miller)\r\naugite as well as hornblende. In one or two cases these angular masses,\r\nthough now quite separate from each other by the solid gneiss, had,\r\nfrom their exact correspondence in size and shape, evidently once been\r\nunited; hence I cannot doubt that most or all of the fragments have\r\nbeen derived from the breaking up of the dikes, of which we see the\r\nfirst stage in the above- mentioned laterally disjointed one. The\r\ngneiss close to the fragments generally contained many large crystals\r\nof hornblende, which are entirely absent or rare in other parts: its\r\nfolia or laminae were gently bent round the fragments, in the same\r\nmanner as they sometimes are round concretions. Hence the gneiss has\r\ncertainly been softened, its composition modified, and its folia\r\narranged, subsequently to the breaking up of the dikes, these latter\r\nalso having been at the same time bent and softened. (Professor\r\nHitchcock “Geology of Massachusetts” volume 2 page 673, gives a closely\r\nsimilar case of a greenstone dike in syenite.)\r\n\r\nI must here take the opportunity of premising, that by the term\r\nCLEAVAGE I imply those planes of division which render a rock,\r\nappearing to the eye quite or nearly homogeneous, fissile. By the term\r\nFOLIATION, I refer to the layers or plates of different mineralogical\r\nnature of which most metamorphic schists are composed; there are, also,\r\noften included in such masses, alternating, homogeneous, fissile layers\r\nor folia, and in this case the rock is both foliated and has a\r\ncleavage. By STRATIFICATION, as applied to these formations, I mean\r\nthose alternate, parallel, large masses of different composition, which\r\nare themselves frequently either foliated or fissile,—such as the\r\nalternating so-called strata of mica-slate, gneiss, glossy clay-slate,\r\nand marble.\r\n\r\nThe folia of the gneiss within a few miles round Bahia generally strike\r\nirregularly, and are often curvilinear, dipping in all directions at\r\nvarious angles: but where best defined, they extended most frequently\r\nin a N.E. by N. (or East 50 degrees N.) and S.W. by S. line,\r\ncorresponding nearly with the coast-line northwards of the bay. I may\r\nadd that Mr. Gardner found in several parts of the province of Ceara,\r\nwhich lies between four and five hundred miles north of Bahia, gneiss\r\nwith the folia extending E. 45 degrees N.; and in Guyana according to\r\nSir R. Schomburgk, the same rock strikes E. 57 degrees N. Again,\r\nHumboldt describes the gneiss-granite over an immense area in Venezuela\r\nand even in Colombia, as striking E. 50 degrees N., and dipping to the\r\nN.W. at an angle of fifty degrees. (Gardner “Geological Section of the\r\nBritish Association” 1840. For Sir R. Schomburgk’s observations see\r\n“Geographical Journal” 1842 page 190. See also Humboldt’s discussion on\r\nLoxodrism in the “Personal Narrative.”) Hence all the observations\r\nhitherto made tend to show that the gneissic rocks over the whole of\r\nthis part of the continent have their folia extending generally within\r\nalmost a point of the compass of the same direction. (I landed at only\r\none place north of Bahia, namely, at Pernambuco. I found there only\r\nsoft, horizontally stratified matter, formed from disintegrated\r\ngranitic rocks, and some yellowish impure limestone, probably of a\r\ntertiary epoch. I have described a most singular natural bar of hard\r\nsandstone, which protects the harbour, in the 19th volume 1841 page 258\r\nof the “London and Edinburgh Philosophical Magazine.”\r\n\r\nABROLHOS ISLETS, Latitude 18 degrees S. off the coast of Brazil.\r\n\r\nAlthough not strictly in place, I do not know where I can more\r\nconveniently describe this little group of small islands. The lowest\r\nbed is a sandstone with ferruginous veins; it weathers into an\r\nextraordinary honeycombed mass; above it there is a dark-coloured\r\nargillaceous shale; above this a coarser sandstone—making a total\r\nthickness of about sixty feet; and lastly, above these sedimentary\r\nbeds, there is a fine conformable mass of greenstone, in some parts\r\nhaving a columnar structure. All the strata, as well as the surface of\r\nthe land, dip at an angle of about 12 degrees to N. by W. Some of the\r\nislets are composed entirely of the sedimentary, others of the trappean\r\nrocks, generally, however, with the sandstone, cropping out on the\r\nsouthern shores.)\r\n\r\nRIO DE JANEIRO.\r\n\r\nThis whole district is almost exclusively formed of gneiss, abounding\r\nwith garnets, and porphyritic with large crystals, even three and four\r\ninches in length, of orthoclase feldspar: in these crystals mica and\r\ngarnets are often enclosed. At the western base of the Corcovado, there\r\nis some ferruginous carious quartz-rock; and in the Tijeuka range, much\r\nfine- grained granite. I observed boulders of greenstone in several\r\nplaces; and on the islet of Villegagnon, and likewise on the coast some\r\nmiles northward, two large trappean dikes. The porphyritic gneiss, or\r\ngneiss- granite as it has been called by Humboldt, is only so far\r\nfoliated that the constituent minerals are arranged with a certain\r\ndegree of regularity, and may be said to have a “GRAIN,” but they are\r\nnot separated into distinct folia or laminae. There are, however,\r\nseveral other varieties of gneiss regularly foliated, and alternating\r\nwith each other in so-called strata. The stratification and foliation\r\nof the ordinary gneisses, and the foliation or “grain” of the\r\ngneiss-granite, are parallel to each other, and generally strike within\r\na point of N.E. and S.W. dipping at a high angle (between 50 and 60\r\ndegrees) generally to S.E.: so that here again we meet with the strike\r\nso prevalent over the more northern parts of this continent. The\r\nmountains of gneiss-granite are to a remarkable degree abruptly\r\nconical, which seems caused by the rock tending to exfoliate in thick,\r\nconically concentric layers: these peaks resemble in shape those of\r\nphonolite and other injected rocks on volcanic islands; nor is the\r\ngrain or foliation (as we shall afterwards see) any difficulty on the\r\nidea of the gneiss-granite having been an intrusive rather than a\r\nmetamorphic formation. The lines of mountains, but not always each\r\nseparate hill, range nearly in the same direction with the foliation\r\nand so-called stratification, but rather more easterly.\r\n\r\n(FIGURE 22. FRAGMENT OF GNEISS EMBEDDED IN ANOTHER VARIETY OF THE SAME\r\nROCK.)\r\n\r\nOn a bare gently inclined surface of the porphyritic gneiss in Botofogo\r\nBay, I observed the appearance represented in Figure 22. A fragment\r\nseven yards long and two in width, with angular and distinctly defined\r\nedges, composed of a peculiar variety of gneiss with dark layers of\r\nmica and garnets, is surrounded on all sides by the ordinary gneiss-\r\ngranite; both having been dislocated by a granitic vein. The folia in\r\nthe fragment and in the surrounding rock strike in the same N.N.E. and\r\nS.S.W. line; but in the fragment they are vertical, whereas in the\r\ngneiss-granite they dip at a small angle, as shown by the arrows, to\r\nS.S.E. This fragment, considering its great size, its solitary\r\nposition, and its foliated structure parallel to that of the\r\nsurrounding rock, is, as far as I know, a unique case: and I will not\r\nattempt any explanation of its origin.\r\n\r\nThe numerous travellers in this country, have all been greatly\r\nsurprised at the depth to which the gneiss and other granitic rocks, as\r\nwell as the talcose slates of the interior, have been decomposed. (Spix\r\nand Martius have collected in an Appendix to their “Travels,” the\r\nlargest body of facts on this subject. See also some remarks by M. Lund\r\nin his communications to the Academy at Copenhagen; and others by M.\r\nGaudichaud in Freycinet “Voyage.”) Near Rio, every mineral except the\r\nquartz has been completely softened, in some places to a depth little\r\nless than one hundred feet. (Dr. Benza describes granitic rock, “Madras\r\nJournal of Literature” etc. October 183? page 246), in the\r\nNeelgherries, decomposed to a depth of forty feet.) The minerals retain\r\ntheir positions in folia ranging in the usual direction; and fractured\r\nquartz veins may be traced from the solid rock, running for some\r\ndistance into the softened, mottled, highly coloured, argillaceous\r\nmass. It is said that these decomposed rocks abound with gems of\r\nvarious kinds, often in a fractured state, owing, as some have\r\nsupposed, to the collapse of geodes, and that they contain gold and\r\ndiamonds. At Rio, it appeared to me that the gneiss had been softened\r\nbefore the excavation (no doubt by the sea) of the existing, broad,\r\nflat-bottomed valleys; for the depth of decomposition did not appear at\r\nall conformable with the present undulations of the surface. The\r\nporphyritic gneiss, where now exposed to the air, seems to withstand\r\ndecomposition remarkably well; and I could see no signs of any tendency\r\nto the production of argillaceous masses like those here described. I\r\nwas also struck with the fact, that where a bare surface of this rock\r\nsloped into one of the quiet bays, there were no marks of erosion at\r\nthe level of the water, and the parts both beneath and above it\r\npreserved a uniform curve. At Bahia, the gneiss rocks are similarly\r\ndecomposed, with the upper parts insensibly losing their foliation, and\r\npassing, without any distinct line of separation, into a bright red\r\nargillaceous earth, including partially rounded fragments of quartz and\r\ngranite. From this circumstance, and from the rocks appearing to have\r\nsuffered decomposition before the excavation of the valleys, I suspect\r\nthat here, as at Rio, the decomposition took place under the sea. The\r\nsubject appeared to me a curious one, and would probably well repay\r\ncareful examination by an able mineralogist.\r\n\r\nTHE NORTHERN PROVINCES OF LA PLATA.\r\n\r\nAccording to some observations communicated to me by Mr. Fox, the coast\r\nfrom Rio de Janeiro to the mouth of the Plata seems everywhere to be\r\ngranitic, with a few trappean dikes. At Port Alegre, near the boundary\r\nof Brazil, there are porphyries and diorites. (M. Isabelle “Voyage a\r\nBuenos Ayres” page 479.) At the mouth of the Plata, I examined the\r\ncountry for twenty-five miles west, and for about seventy miles north\r\nof Maldonado: near this town, there is some common gneiss, and much, in\r\nall parts of the country, of a coarse-grained mixture of quartz and\r\nreddish feldspar, often, however, assuming a little dark-green\r\nimperfect hornblende, and then immediately becoming foliated. The\r\nabrupt hillocks thus composed, as well as the highly inclined folia of\r\nthe common varieties of gneiss, strike N.N.E. or a little more\r\neasterly, and S.S.W. Clay-slate is occasionally met with, and near the\r\nL. del Potrero, there is white marble, rendered fissile from the\r\npresence of hornblende, mica, and asbestus; the cleavage of these rocks\r\nand their stratification, that is the alternating masses thus composed,\r\nstrike N.N.E. and S.S.W. like the foliated gneisses, and have an almost\r\nvertical dip. The Sierra Larga, a low range five miles west of\r\nMaldonado, consists of quartzite, often ferruginous, having an\r\narenaceous feel, and divided into excessively thin, almost vertical\r\nlaminae or folia by microscopically minute scales, apparently of mica,\r\nand striking in the usual N.N.E. and S.S.W. direction. The range itself\r\nis formed of one principal line with some subordinate ones; and it\r\nextends with remarkable uniformity far northward (it is said even to\r\nthe confines of Brazil), in the same line with the vertically ribboned\r\nquartz rock of which it is composed. The S. de Las Animas is the\r\nhighest range in the country; I estimated it at 1,000 feet; it runs\r\nnorth and south, and is formed of feldspathic porphyry; near its base\r\nthere is a N.N.W. and S.S.E. ridge of a conglomerate in a highly\r\nporphyritic basis.\r\n\r\nNorthward of Maldonado, and south of Las Minas, there is an E. and W.\r\nhilly band of country, some miles in width, formed of siliceous\r\nclay-slate, with some quartz, rock, and limestone, having a tortuous\r\nirregular cleavage, generally ranging east and west. E. and S.E. of Las\r\nMinas there is a confused district of imperfect gneiss and laminated\r\nquartz, with the hills ranging in various directions, but with each\r\nseparate hill generally running in the same line with the folia of the\r\nrocks of which it is composed: this confusion appears to have been\r\ncaused by the intersection of the [E. and W.] and [N.N.E. and S.S.W.]\r\nstrikes. Northward of Las Minas, the more regular northerly ranges\r\npredominate: from this place to near Polanco, we meet with the\r\ncoarse-grained mixture of quartz and feldspar, often with the imperfect\r\nhornblende, and then becoming foliated in a N. and S. line—with\r\nimperfect clay-slate, including laminae of red crystallised\r\nfeldspar—with white or black marble, sometimes containing asbestus and\r\ncrystals of gypsum—with quartz-rock—with syenite—and lastly, with much\r\ngranite. The marble and granite alternate repeatedly in apparently\r\nvertical masses: some miles northward of the Polanco, a wide district\r\nis said to be entirely composed of marble. It is remarkable, how rare\r\nmica is in the whole range of country north and westward of Maldonado.\r\nThroughout this district, the cleavage of the clay-slate and marble—the\r\nfoliation of the gneiss and the quartz—the stratification or\r\nalternating masses of these several rocks—and the range of the hills,\r\nall coincide in direction; and although the country is only hilly, the\r\nplanes of division are almost everywhere very highly inclined or\r\nvertical.\r\n\r\nSome ancient submarine volcanic rocks are worth mentioning, from their\r\nrarity on this eastern side of the continent. In the valley of the\r\nTapas (fifty or sixty miles N. of Maldonado) there is a tract three or\r\nfour miles in length, composed of various trappean rocks with glassy\r\nfeldspar—of apparently metamorphosed grit-stones—of purplish\r\namygdaloids with large kernels of carbonate of lime (Near the Pan de\r\nAzucar there is some greenish porphyry, in one place amygdaloidal with\r\nagate.)—and much of a harshish rock with glassy feldspar intermediate\r\nin character between claystone porphyry and trachyte. This latter rock\r\nwas in one spot remarkable from being full of drusy cavities, lined\r\nwith quartz crystals, and arranged in planes, dipping at an angle of 50\r\ndegrees to the east, and striking parallel to the foliation of an\r\nadjoining hill composed of the common mixture of quartz, feldspar, and\r\nimperfect hornblende: this fact perhaps indicates that these volcanic\r\nrocks have been metamorphosed, and their constituent parts rearranged,\r\nat the same time and according to the same laws, with the granitic and\r\nmetamorphic formations of this whole region. In the valley of the\r\nMarmaraya, a few miles south of the Tapas, a band of trappean and\r\namygdaloidal rock is interposed between a hill of granite and an\r\nextensive surrounding formation of red conglomerate, which (like that\r\nat the foot of the S. Animas) has its basis porphyritic with crystals\r\nof feldspar, and which hence has certainly suffered metamorphosis.\r\n\r\nMONTE VIDEO.\r\n\r\nThe rocks here consist of several varieties of gneiss, with the\r\nfeldspar often yellowish, granular and imperfectly crystallised,\r\nalternating with, and passing insensibly into, beds, from a few yards\r\nto nearly a mile in thickness, of fine or coarse grained, dark-green\r\nhornblendic slate; this again often passing into chloritic schist.\r\nThese passages seem chiefly due to changes in the mica, and its\r\nreplacement by other minerals. At Rat Island I examined a mass of\r\nchloritic schist, only a few yards square, irregularly surrounded on\r\nall sides by the gneiss, and intricately penetrated by many curvilinear\r\nveins of quartz, which gradually BLEND into the gneiss: the cleavage of\r\nthe chloritic schist and the foliation of the gneiss were exactly\r\nparallel. Eastward of the city there is much fine- grained,\r\ndark-coloured gneiss, almost assuming the character of hornblende-\r\nslate, which alternates in thin laminae with laminae of quartz, the\r\nwhole mass being transversely intersected by numerous large veins of\r\nquartz: I particularly observed that these veins were absolutely\r\ncontinuous with the alternating laminae of quartz. In this case and at\r\nRat Island, the passage of the gneiss into imperfect hornblendic or\r\ninto chloritic slate, seemed to be connected with the segregation of\r\nthe veins of quartz. (Mr. Greenough page 78 “Critical Examination”\r\netc., observes that quartz in mica-slate sometimes appears in beds and\r\nsometimes in veins. Von Buch also in his “Travels in Norway” page 236,\r\nremarks on alternating laminae of quartz and hornblende-slate replacing\r\nmica-schist.)\r\n\r\nThe Mount, a hill believed to be 450 feet in height, from which the\r\nplace takes its name, is much the highest land in this neighbourhood:\r\nit consists of hornblendic slate, which (except on the eastern and\r\ndisturbed base) has an east and west nearly vertical cleavage; the\r\nlonger axis of the hill also ranges in this same line. Near the summit\r\nthe hornblende-slate gradually becomes more and more coarsely\r\ncrystallised, and less plainly laminated, until it passes into a heavy,\r\nsonorous greenstone, with a slaty conchoidal fracture; the laminae on\r\nthe north and south sides near the summit dip inwards, as if this upper\r\npart had expanded or bulged outwards. This greenstone must, I conceive,\r\nbe considered as metamorphosed hornblende- slate. The Cerrito, the next\r\nhighest, but much less elevated point, is almost similarly composed. In\r\nthe more western parts of the province, besides gneiss, there is\r\nquartz-rock, syenite, and granite; and at Colla, I heard of marble.\r\n\r\nNear M. Video, the space which I more accurately examined was about\r\nfifteen miles in an east and west line, and here I found the foliation\r\nof the gneiss and the cleavage of the slates generally well developed,\r\nand extending parallel to the alternating strata composed of the\r\ngneiss, hornblendic and chloritic schists. These planes of division all\r\nrange within one point of east and west, frequently east by south and\r\nwest by north; their dip is generally almost vertical, and scarcely\r\nanywhere under 45 degrees: this fact, considering how slightly\r\nundulatory the surface of the country is, deserves attention. Westward\r\nof M. Video, towards the Uruguay, wherever the gneiss is exposed, the\r\nhighly inclined folia are seen striking in the same direction; I must\r\nexcept one spot where the strike was N.W. by W. The little Sierra de S.\r\nJuan, formed of gneiss and laminated quartz, must also be excepted, for\r\nit ranges between [N. to N.E.] and [S. to S.W.] and seems to belong to\r\nthe same system with the hills in the Maldonado district. Finally, we\r\nhave seen that, for many miles northward of Maldonado and for\r\ntwenty-five miles westward of it, as far as the S. de las Animas, the\r\nfoliation, cleavage, so-called stratification and lines of hills, all\r\nrange N.N.E. and S.S.W., which is nearly coincident with the adjoining\r\ncoast of the Atlantic. Westward of the S. de las Animas, as far as even\r\nthe Uruguay, the foliation, cleavage, and stratification (but not lines\r\nof hills, for there are no defined ones) all range about E. by S. and\r\nW. by N., which is nearly coincident with the direction of the northern\r\nshore of the Plata; in the confused country near Las Minas, where these\r\ntwo great systems appear to intersect each other, the cleavage,\r\nfoliation, and stratification run in various directions, but generally\r\ncoincide with the line of each separate hill.\r\n\r\nSOUTHERN LA PLATA.\r\n\r\nThe first ridge, south of the Plata, which projects through the Pampean\r\nformation, is the Sierra Tapalguen and Vulcan, situated 200 miles\r\nsouthward of the district just described. This ridge is only a few\r\nhundred feet in height, and runs from C. Corrientes in a W.N.W. line\r\nfor at least 150 miles into the interior: at Tapalguen, it is composed\r\nof unstratified granular quartz, remarkable from forming tabular masses\r\nand small plains, surrounded by precipitous cliffs: other parts of the\r\nrange are said to consist of granite: and marble is found at the S.\r\nTinta. It appears from M. Parchappe’s observations, that at Tandil\r\nthere is a range of quartzose gneiss, very like the rocks of the S.\r\nLarga near Maldonado, running in the same N.N.E. and S.S.W. direction;\r\nso that the framework of the country here is very similar to that on\r\nthe northern shore of the Plata. (M. d’Orbigny’s “Voyage” Part. Geolog.\r\npage 46. I have given a short account of the peculiar forms of the\r\nquartz hills of Tapalguen, so unusual in a metamorphic formation, in my\r\n“Journal of Researches” 2nd edition page 116.)\r\n\r\nThe Sierra Guitru-gueyu is situated sixty miles south of the S.\r\nTapalguen: it consists of numerous parallel, sometimes blended together\r\nridges, about twenty-three miles in width, and five hundred feet in\r\nheight above the plain, and extending in a N.W. and S.E. direction.\r\nSkirting round the extreme S.E. termination, I ascended only a few\r\npoints, which were composed of a fine-grained gneiss, almost composed\r\nof feldspar with a little mica, and passing in the upper parts of the\r\nhills into a rather compact purplish clay-slate. The cleavage was\r\nnearly vertical, striking in a N.W. by W. and S.E. by E. line, nearly,\r\nthough not quite, coincident with the direction of the parallel ridges.\r\n\r\nThe Sierra Ventana lies close south of that of Guitru-gueyu; it is\r\nremarkable from attaining a height, very unusual on this side of the\r\ncontinent, of 3,340 feet. It consists up to its summit, of quartz,\r\ngenerally pure and white, but sometimes reddish, and divided into thick\r\nlaminae or strata: in one part there is a little glossy clay-slate with\r\na tortuous cleavage. The thick layers of quartz strike in a W. 30\r\ndegrees N. line, dipping southerly at an angle of 45 degrees and\r\nupwards. The principal line of mountains, with some quite subordinate\r\nparallel ridges, range about W. 45 degrees N.: but at their S.E.\r\ntermination, only W. 25 degrees N. This Sierra is said to extend\r\nbetween twenty and thirty leagues into the interior.\r\n\r\nPATAGONIA.\r\n\r\nWith the exception perhaps of the hill of S. Antonio (600 feet high) in\r\nthe Gulf of S. Matias, which has never been visited by a geologist,\r\ncrystalline rocks are not met with on the coast of Patagonia for a\r\nspace of 380 miles south of the S. Ventana. At this point (latitude 43\r\ndegrees 50 minutes), at Points Union and Tombo, plutonic rocks are said\r\nto appear, and are found, at rather wide intervals, beneath the\r\nPatagonian tertiary formation for a space of about three hundred miles\r\nsouthward, to near Bird Island, in latitude 48 degrees 56 minutes.\r\nJudging from specimens kindly collected for me by Mr. Stokes, the\r\nprevailing rock at Ports St. Elena, Camerones, Malaspina, and as far\r\nsouth as the Paps of Pineda, is a purplish-pink or brownish claystone\r\nporphyry, sometimes laminated, sometimes slightly vesicular, with\r\ncrystals of opaque feldspar and with a few grains of quartz; hence\r\nthese porphyries resemble those immediately to be described at Port\r\nDesire, and likewise a series which I have seen from P. Alegre on the\r\nsouthern confines of Brazil. This porphyritic formation further\r\nresembles in a singularly close manner the lowest stratified formation\r\nof the Cordillera of Chile, which, as we shall hereafter see, has a\r\nvast range, and attains a great thickness. At the bottom of the Gulf of\r\nSt. George, only tertiary deposits appear to be present. At Cape\r\nBlanco, there is quartz rock, very like that of the Falkland Islands,\r\nand some hard, blue siliceous clay-slate.\r\n\r\nAt Port Desire there is an extensive formation of the claystone\r\nporphyry, stretching at least twenty-five miles into the interior: it\r\nhas been denuded and deeply worn into gullies before being covered up\r\nby the tertiary deposits, through which it here and there projects in\r\nhills; those north of the bay being 440 feet in height. The strata have\r\nin several places been tilted at small angles, generally either to\r\nN.N.W. or S.S.E. By gradual passages and alternations, the porphyries\r\nchange incessantly in nature. I will describe only some of the\r\nprincipal mineralogical changes, which are highly instructive, and\r\nwhich I carefully examined. The prevailing rock has a compact purplish\r\nbase, with crystals of earthy or opaque feldspar, and often with grains\r\nof quartz. There are other varieties, with an almost truly trachytic\r\nbase, full of little angular vesicles and crystals of glassy feldspar;\r\nand there are beds of black perfect pitchstone, as well as of a\r\nconcretionary imperfect variety. On a casual inspection, the whole\r\nseries would be thought to be of the same plutonic or volcanic nature\r\nwith the trachytic varieties and pitchstone; but this is far from being\r\nthe case, as much of the porphyry is certainly of metamorphic origin.\r\nBesides the true porphyries, there are many beds of earthy, quite white\r\nor yellowish, friable, easily fusible matter, resembling chalk, which\r\nunder the microscope is seen to consist of minute broken crystals, and\r\nwhich, as remarked in a former chapter, singularly resembles the upper\r\ntufaceous beds of the Patagonian tertiary formation. This earthy\r\nsubstance often becomes coarser, and contains minute rounded fragments\r\nof porphyries and rounded grains of quartz, and in one case so many of\r\nthe latter as to resemble a common sandstone. These beds are sometimes\r\nmarked with true lines of aqueous deposition, separating particles of\r\ndifferent degrees of coarseness; in other cases there are parallel\r\nferruginous lines not of true deposition, as shown by the arrangement\r\nof the particles, though singularly resembling them. The more indurated\r\nvarieties often include many small and some larger angular cavities,\r\nwhich appear due to the removal of earthy matter: some varieties\r\ncontain mica. All these earthy and generally white stones insensibly\r\npass into more indurated sonorous varieties, breaking with a conchoidal\r\nfracture, yet of small specific gravity; many of these latter varieties\r\nassume a pale purple tint, being singularly banded and veined with\r\ndifferent shades, and often become plainly porphyritic with crystals of\r\nfeldspar. The formation of these crystals could be most clearly traced\r\nby minute angular and often partially hollow patches of earthy matter,\r\nfirst assuming a FIBROUS STRUCTURE, then passing into opaque\r\nimperfectly shaped crystals, and lastly, into perfect glassy crystals.\r\nWhen these crystals have appeared, and when the basis has become\r\ncompact, the rock in many places could not be distinguished from a true\r\nclaystone porphyry without a trace of mechanical structure.\r\n\r\nIn some parts, these earthy or tufaceous beds pass into jaspery and\r\ninto beautifully mottled and banded porcelain rocks, which break into\r\nsplinters, translucent at their edges, hard enough to scratch glass,\r\nand fusible into white transparent beads: grains of quartz included in\r\nthe porcelainous varieties can be seen melting into the surrounding\r\npaste. In other parts, the earthy or tufaceous beds either insensibly\r\npass into, or alternate with, breccias composed of large and small\r\nfragments of various purplish porphyries, with the matrix generally\r\nporphyritic: these breccias, though their subaqueous origin is in many\r\nplaces shown both by the arrangement of their smaller particles and by\r\nan oblique or current lamination, also pass into porphyries, in which\r\nevery trace of mechanical origin and stratification has been\r\nobliterated.\r\n\r\nSome highly porphyritic though coarse-grained masses, evidently of\r\nsedimentary origin, and divided into thin layers, differing from each\r\nother chiefly in the number of embedded grains of quartz, interested me\r\nmuch from the peculiar manner in which here and there some of the\r\nlayers terminated in abrupt points, quite unlike those produced by a\r\nlayer of sediment naturally thinning out, and apparently the result of\r\na subsequent process of metamorphic aggregation. In another common\r\nvariety of a finer texture, the aggregating process had gone further,\r\nfor the whole mass consisted of quite short, parallel, often slightly\r\ncurved layers or patches, of whitish or reddish finely\r\ngranulo-crystalline feldspathic matter, generally terminating at both\r\nends in blunt points; these layers or patches further tended to pass\r\ninto wedge or almond-shaped little masses, and these finally into true\r\ncrystals of feldspar, with their centres often slightly drusy. The\r\nseries was so perfect that I could not doubt that these large crystals,\r\nwhich had their longer axes placed parallel to each other, had\r\nprimarily originated in the metamorphosis and aggregation of\r\nalternating layers of tuff; and hence their parallel position must be\r\nattributed (unexpected though the conclusion may be), not to laws of\r\nchemical action, but to the original planes of deposition. I am tempted\r\nbriefly to describe three other singular allied varieties of rock; the\r\nfirst without examination would have passed for a stratified\r\nporphyritic breccia, but all the included angular fragments consisted\r\nof a border of pinkish crystalline feldspathic matter, surrounding a\r\ndark translucent siliceous centre, in which grains of quartz not quite\r\nblended into the paste could be distinguished: this uniformity in the\r\nnature of the fragments shows that they are not of mechanical, but of\r\nconcretionary origin, having resulted perhaps from the self-breaking up\r\nand aggregation of layers of indurated tuff containing numerous grains\r\nof quartz,—into which, indeed, the whole mass in one part passed. The\r\nsecond variety is a reddish non-porphyritic claystone, quite full of\r\nspherical cavities, about half an inch in diameter, each lined with a\r\ncollapsed crust formed of crystals of quartz. The third variety also\r\nconsists of a pale purple non-porphyritic claystone, almost wholly\r\nformed of concretionary balls, obscurely arranged in layers, of a less\r\ncompact and paler coloured claystone; each ball being on one side\r\npartly hollow and lined with crystals of quartz.\r\n\r\nPSEUDO-DIKES.\r\n\r\nSome miles up the harbour, in a line of cliffs formed of slightly\r\nmetamorphosed tufaceous and porphyritic claystone beds, I observed\r\nthree vertical dikes, so closely resembling in general appearance\r\nordinary volcanic dikes, that I did not doubt, until closely examining\r\ntheir composition, that they had been injected from below. The first is\r\nstraight, with parallel sides, and about four feet wide; it consists of\r\nwhitish, indurated tufaceous matter, precisely like some of the beds\r\nintersected by it. The second dike is more remarkable; it is slightly\r\ntortuous, about eighteen inches thick, and can be traced for a\r\nconsiderable distance along the beach; it is of a purplish-red or brown\r\ncolour, and is formed chiefly of ROUNDED grains of quartz, with broken\r\ncrystals of earthy feldspar, scales of black mica, and minute fragments\r\nof claystone porphyry, all firmly united together in a hard sparing\r\nbase. The structure of this dike shows obviously that it is of\r\nmechanical and sedimentary origin; yet it thinned out upwards, and did\r\nnot cut through the uppermost strata in the cliffs. This fact at first\r\nappears to indicate that the matter could not have been washed in from\r\nabove (Upfilled fissures are known to occur both in volcanic and in\r\nordinary sedimentary formations. At the Galapagos Archipelago “Volcanic\r\nIslands” etc., there are some striking examples of pseudo-dikes\r\ncomposed of hard tuff.); but if we reflect on the suction which would\r\nresult from a deep-seated fissure being formed, we may admit that if\r\nthe fissure were in any part open to the surface, mud and water might\r\nwell be drawn into it along its whole course. The third dike consisted\r\nof a hard, rough, white rock, almost composed of broken crystals of\r\nglassy feldspar, with numerous scales of black mica, cemented in a\r\nscanty base; there was little in the appearance of this rock, to\r\npreclude the idea of its having been a true injected feldspathic dike.\r\nThe matter composing these three pseudo-dikes, especially the second\r\none, appears to have suffered, like the surrounding strata, a certain\r\ndegree of metamorphic action; and this has much aided the deceptive\r\nappearance. At Bahia, in Brazil, we have seen that a true injected\r\nhornblendic dike, not only has suffered metamorphosis, but has been\r\ndislocated and even diffused in the surrounding gneiss, under the form\r\nof separate crystals and of fragments.\r\n\r\nFALKLAND ISLANDS.\r\n\r\nI have described these islands in a paper published in the third volume\r\nof the “Geological Journal.” The mountain-ridges consist of quartz, and\r\nthe lower country of clay-slate and sandstone, the latter containing\r\nPalaeozoic fossils. These fossils have been separately described by\r\nMessrs. Morris and Sharpe: some of them resemble Silurian, and others\r\nDevonian forms. In the eastern part of the group the several parallel\r\nridges of quartz extend in a west and east line; but further westward\r\nthe line becomes W.N.W. and E.S.E., and even still more northerly. The\r\ncleavage-planes of the clay- slate are highly inclined, generally at an\r\nangle of above 50 degrees, and often vertical; they strike almost\r\ninvariably in the same direction with the quartz ranges. The outline of\r\nthe indented shores of the two main islands, and the relative positions\r\nof the smaller islets, accord with the strike both of the main axes of\r\nelevation and of the cleavage of the clay- slate.\r\n\r\nTIERRA DEL FUEGO.\r\n\r\nMy notes on the geology of this country are copious, but as they are\r\nunimportant, and as fossils were found only in one district, a brief\r\nsketch will be here sufficient. The east coast from the S. of Magellan\r\n(where the boulder formation is largely developed) to St. Polycarp’s\r\nBay is formed of horizontal tertiary strata, bounded some way towards\r\nthe interior by a broad mountainous band of clay-slate. This great\r\nclay-slate formation extends from St. Le Maire westward for 140 miles,\r\nalong both sides of the Beagle Channel to near its bifurcation. South\r\nof this channel, it forms all Navarin Island, and the eastern half of\r\nHoste Island and of Hardy Peninsula; north of the Beagle Channel it\r\nextends in a north-west line on both sides of Admiralty Sound to\r\nBrunswick Peninsula in the St. of Magellan, and I have reason to\r\nbelieve, stretches far up the eastern side of the Cordillera. The\r\nwestern and broken side of Tierra del Fuego towards the Pacific is\r\nformed of metamorphic schists, granite and various trappean rocks: the\r\nline of separation between the crystalline and clay-slate formations\r\ncan generally be distinguished, as remarked by Captain King, by the\r\nparallelism in the clay-slate districts of the shores and channels,\r\nranging in a line between [W. 20 degrees to 40 degrees N.] and [E. 20\r\ndegrees to 40 degrees S.]. (“Geographical Journal” volume 1 page 155.)\r\n\r\nThe clay-slate is generally fissile, sometimes siliceous or\r\nferruginous, with veins of quartz and calcareous spar; it often\r\nassumes, especially on the loftier mountains, an altered feldspathic\r\ncharacter, passing into feldspathic porphyry: occasionally it is\r\nassociated with breccia and grauwacke. At Good Success Bay, there is a\r\nlittle intercalated black crystalline limestone. At Port Famine much of\r\nthe clay-slate is calcareous, and passes either into a mudstone or into\r\ngrauwacke, including odd-shaped concretions of dark argillaceous\r\nlimestone. Here alone, on the shore a few miles north of Port Famine,\r\nand on the summit of Mount Tarn (2,600 feet high), I found organic\r\nremains; they consist of:—\r\n\r\n1. Ancyloceras simplex, d’Orbigny “Pal Franc” Mount Tarn. 2. Fusus (in\r\nimperfect state), d’Orbigny “Pal Franc” Mount Tarn. 3. Natica,\r\nd’Orbigny “Pal Franc” Mount Tarn. 4. Pentacrimus, d’Orbigny “Pal Franc”\r\nMount Tarn. 5. Lucina excentrica, G.B. Sowerby, Port Famine. 6. Venus\r\n(in imperfect state), G.B. Sowerby, Port Famine. 7. Turbinolia (?),\r\nG.B. Sowerby, Port Famine. 8. Hamites elatior, G.B. Sowerby, Port\r\nFamine.\r\n\r\nM. d’Orbigny states that MM. Hombron and Grange found in this\r\nneighbourhood an Ancyloceras, perhaps A. simplex, an Ammonite, a\r\nPlicatula and Modiola. (“Voyage” Part Geolog. page 242.) M. d’Orbigny\r\nbelieves from the general character of these fossils, and from the\r\nAncyloceras being identical (as far as its imperfect condition allows\r\nof comparison) with the A. simplex of Europe, that the formation\r\nbelongs to an early stage of the Cretaceous system. Professor E.\r\nForbes, judging only from my specimens, concurs in the probability of\r\nthis conclusion. The Hamites elatior of the above list, of which a\r\ndescription has been given by Mr. Sowerby, and which is remarkable from\r\nits large size, has not been seen either by M. d’Orbigny or Professor\r\nE. Forbes, as, since my return to England, the specimens have been\r\nlost. The great clay-slate formation of Tierra del Fuego being\r\ncretaceous, is certainly a very interesting fact,—whether we consider\r\nthe appearance of the country, which, without the evidence afforded by\r\nthe fossils, would form the analogy of most known districts, probably\r\nhave been considered as belonging to the Palaeozoic series,—or whether\r\nwe view it as showing that the age of this terminal portion of the\r\ngreat axis of South America, is the same (as will hereafter be seen)\r\nwith the Cordillera of Chile and Peru.\r\n\r\nThe clay-slate in many parts of Tierra del Fuego, is broken by dikes\r\nand by great masses of greenstone, often highly hornblendic (In a\r\ngreenstone-dike in the Magdalen Channel, the feldspar cleaved with the\r\nangle of albite. This dike was crossed, as well as the surrounding\r\nslate, by a large vein of quartz, a circumstance of unusual\r\noccurrence.): almost all the small islets within the clay-slate\r\ndistricts are thus composed. The slate near the dikes generally becomes\r\npaler-coloured, harder, less fissile, of a feldspathic nature, and\r\npasses into a porphyry or greenstone: in one case, however, it became\r\nmore fissile, of a red colour, and contained minute scales of mica,\r\nwhich were absent in the unaltered rock. On the east side of Ponsonby\r\nSound some dikes composed of a pale sonorous feldspathic rock,\r\nporphyritic with a little feldspar, were remarkable from their\r\nnumber,—there being within the space of a mile at least one\r\nhundred,—from their nearly equalling in bulk the intermediate\r\nslate,—and more especially from the excessive fineness (like the finest\r\ninlaid carpentry) and perfect parallelism of their junctions with the\r\nalmost vertical laminae of clay-slate. I was unable to persuade myself\r\nthat these great parallel masses had been injected, until I found one\r\ndike which abruptly thinned out to half its thickness, and had one of\r\nits walls jagged, with fragments of the slate embedded in it.\r\n\r\nIn Southern Tierra del Fuego, the clay-slate towards its S.W. boundary,\r\nbecomes much altered and feldspathic. Thus on Wollaston Island slate\r\nand grauwacke can be distinctly traced passing into feldspathic rocks\r\nand greenstones, including iron pyrites and epidote, but still\r\nretaining traces of cleavage with the usual strike and dip. One such\r\nmetamorphosed mass was traversed by large vein-like masses of a\r\nbeautiful mixture (as ascertained by Professor Miller) of green\r\nepidote, garnets, and white calcareous spar. On the northern point of\r\nthis same island, there were various ancient submarine volcanic rocks,\r\nconsisting of amygdaloids with dark bole and agate,—of basalt with\r\ndecomposed olivine—of compact lava with glassy feldspar,—and of a\r\ncoarse conglomerate of red scoriae, parts being amygdaloidal with\r\ncarbonate of lime. The southern part of Wollaston Island and the whole\r\nof Hermite and Horn Islands, seem formed of cones of greenstone; the\r\noutlying islets of Il Defenso and D. Raminez are said to consist of\r\nporphyritic lava. (Determined by Professor Jameson. Weddell’s “Voyage”\r\npage 169.) In crossing Hardy Peninsula, the slate still retaining\r\ntraces of its usual cleavage, passes into columnar feldspathic rocks,\r\nwhich are succeeded by an irregular tract of trappean and basaltic\r\nrocks, containing glassy feldspar and much iron pyrites: there is,\r\nalso, some harsh red claystone porphyry, and an almost true trachyte,\r\nwith needles of hornblende, and in one spot a curious slaty rock\r\ndivided into quadrangular columns, having a base almost like trachyte,\r\nwith drusy cavities lined by crystals, too imperfect, according to\r\nProfessor Miller, to be measured, but resembling Zeagonite. (See Mr.\r\nBrooke’s Paper in the “London Philosophical Magazine” volume 10. This\r\nmineral occurs in an ancient volcanic rock near Rome.) In the midst of\r\nthese singular rocks, no doubt of ancient submarine volcanic origin, a\r\nhigh hill of feldspathic clay-slate projected, retaining its usual\r\ncleavage. Near this point, there was a small hillock, having the aspect\r\nof granite, but formed of white albite, brilliant crystals of\r\nhornblende (both ascertained by the reflecting goniometer) and mica;\r\nbut with no quartz. No recent volcanic district has been observed in\r\nany part of Tierra del Fuego.\r\n\r\nFive miles west of the bifurcation of the Beagle Channel, the slate-\r\nformation, instead of becoming, as in the more southern parts of Tierra\r\ndel Fuego, feldspathic, and associated with trappean or old volcanic\r\nrocks, passes by alternations into a great underlying mass of fine\r\ngneiss and glossy clay-slate, which at no great distance is succeeded\r\nby a grand formation of mica-slate containing garnets. The folia of\r\nthese metamorphic schists strike parallel to the cleavage-planes of the\r\nclay-slate, which have a very uniform direction over the whole of this\r\npart of the country: the folia, however, are undulatory and tortuous,\r\nwhilst the cleavage- laminae of the slate are straight. These schists\r\ncompose the chief mountain-chain of Southern Tierra del Fuego, ranging\r\nalong the north side of the northern arm of the Beagle Channel, in a\r\nshort W.N.W. and E.S.E. line, with two points (Mounts Sarmiento and\r\nDarwin) rising to heights of 6,800 and 6,900 feet. On the south-western\r\nside of this northern arm of the Beagle Channel, the clay-slate is seen\r\nwith its STRATA dipping from the great chain, so that the metamorphic\r\nschists here form a ridge bordered on each side by clay-slate. Further\r\nnorth, however, to the west of this great range, there is no\r\nclay-slate, but only gneiss, mica, and hornblendic slates, resting on\r\ngreat barren hills of true granite, and forming a tract about sixty\r\nmiles in width. Again, westward of these rocks, the outermost islands\r\nare of trappean formation, which, from information obtained during the\r\nvoyages of the “Adventure” and “Beagle,” seem, together with granite,\r\nchiefly to prevail along the western coast as far north as the entrance\r\nof the St. of Magellan (See the Paper by Captain King in the\r\n“Geographical Journal”; also a Letter to Dr. Fitton in “Geological\r\nProceedings” volume 1 page 29; also some observations by Captain\r\nFitzroy “Voyages” volume 1 page 375. I am indebted also to Mr. Lyell\r\nfor a series of specimens collected by Lieutenant Graves.): a little\r\nmore inland, on the eastern side of Clarence Island and S. Desolation,\r\ngranite, greenstone, mica-slate, and gneiss appear to predominate. I am\r\ntempted to believe, that where the clay-slate has been metamorphosed at\r\ngreat depths beneath the surface, gneiss, mica- slate, and other allied\r\nrocks have been formed, but where the action has taken place nearer the\r\nsurface, feldspathic porphyries, greenstones, etc., have resulted,\r\noften accompanied by submarine volcanic eruptions.\r\n\r\nOnly one other rock, met with in both arms of the Beagle Channel,\r\ndeserves any notice, namely a granulo-crystalline mixture of white\r\nalbite, black hornblende (ascertained by measurement of the crystals,\r\nand confirmed by Professor Miller), and more or less of brown mica, but\r\nwithout any quartz. This rock occurs in large masses, closely\r\nresembling in external form granite or syenite: in the southern arm of\r\nthe Channel, one such mass underlies the mica-slate, on which\r\nclay-slate was superimposed: this peculiar plutonic rock which, as we\r\nhave seen, occurs also in Hardy Peninsula, is interesting, from its\r\nperfect similarity with that (hereafter often to be referred to under\r\nthe name of andesite) forming the great injected axes of the Cordillera\r\nof Chile.\r\n\r\nThe stratification of the clay-slate is generally very obscure, whereas\r\nthe cleavage is remarkably well defined: to begin with the extreme\r\neastern parts of Tierra del Fuego; the cleavage-planes near the St. of\r\nLe Maire strike either W. and E. or W.S.W. and E.N.E., and are highly\r\ninclined; the form of the land, including Staten Island, indicates that\r\nthe axes of elevation have run in this same line, though I was unable\r\nto distinguish the planes of stratification. Proceeding westward, I\r\naccurately examined the cleavage of the clay-slate on the northern,\r\neastern, and western sides (thirty-five miles apart) of Navarin Island,\r\nand everywhere found the laminae ranging with extreme regularity,\r\nW.N.W. and E.S.E., seldom varying more than one point of the compass\r\nfrom this direction. (The clay-slate in this island was in many places\r\ncrossed by parallel smooth joints. Out of five cases, the angle of\r\nintersection between the strike of these joints and that of the\r\ncleavage-laminae was in two cases 45 degrees and in two others 79\r\ndegrees.) Both on the east and west coasts, I crossed at right angles\r\nthe cleavage-planes for a space of about eight miles, and found them\r\ndipping at an angle of between 45 degrees and 90 degrees, generally to\r\nS.S.W., sometimes to N.N.E., and often quite vertically. The S.S.W. dip\r\nwas occasionally succeeded abruptly by a N.N.E. dip, and this by a\r\nvertical cleavage, or again by the S.S.W. dip; as in a lofty cliff on\r\nthe eastern end of the island the laminae of slate were seen to be\r\nfolded into very large steep curves, ranging in the usual W.N.W. line,\r\nI suspect that the varying and opposite dips may possibly be accounted\r\nfor by the cleavage- laminae, though to the eye appearing straight,\r\nbeing parts of large abrupt curves, with their summits cut off and worn\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nIn several places I was particularly struck with the fact, that the\r\nfine laminae of the clay-slate, where cutting straight through the\r\nbands of stratification, and therefore indisputably true\r\ncleavage-planes, differed slightly in their greyish and greenish tints\r\nof colour, in compactness, and in some of the laminae having a rather\r\nmore jaspery appearance than others. I have not seen this fact\r\nrecorded, and it appears to me important, for it shows that the same\r\ncause which has produced the highly fissile structure, has altered in a\r\nslight degree the mineralogical character of the rock in the same\r\nplanes. The bands of stratification, just alluded to, can be\r\ndistinguished in many places, especially in Navarin Island, but only on\r\nthe weathered surfaces of the slate; they consist of slightly\r\nundulatory zones of different shades of colour and of thicknesses, and\r\nresemble the marks (more closely than anything else to which I can\r\ncompare them) left on the inside of a vessel by the draining away of\r\nsome dirty slightly agitated liquid: no difference in composition,\r\ncorresponding with these zones, could be seen in freshly fractured\r\nsurfaces. In the more level parts of Navarin Island, these bands of\r\nstratification were nearly horizontal; but on the flanks of the\r\nmountains they were inclined from them, but in no instance that I saw\r\nat a very high angle. There can, I think, be no doubt that these zones,\r\nwhich appear only on the weathered surfaces, are the last vestiges of\r\nthe original planes of stratification, now almost obliterated by the\r\nhighly fissile and altered structure which the mass has assumed.\r\n\r\nThe clay-slate cleaves in the same W.N.W. and E.S.E. direction, as on\r\nNavarin Island, on both sides of the Beagle Channel, on the eastern\r\nside of Hoste Island, on the N.E. side of Hardy Peninsula, and on the\r\nnorthern point of Wollaston Island; although in these two latter\r\nlocalities the cleavage has been much obscured by the metamorphosed and\r\nfeldspathic condition of the slate. Within the area of these several\r\nislands, including Navarin Island, the direction of the stratification\r\nand of the mountain- chains is very obscure; though the mountains in\r\nseveral places appeared to range in the same W.N.W. line with the\r\ncleavage: the outline of the coast, however, does not correspond with\r\nthis line. Near the bifurcation of the Beagle Channel, where the\r\nunderlying metamorphic schists are first seen, they are foliated (with\r\nsome irregularities), in this same W.N.W. line, and parallel, as before\r\nstated, to the main mountain-axis of this part of the country. Westward\r\nof this main range, the metamorphic schists are foliated, though less\r\nplainly, in the same direction, which is likewise common to the zone of\r\nold erupted trappean rocks, forming the outermost islets. Hence the\r\narea, over which the cleavage of the slate and the foliation of the\r\nmetamorphic schists extends with an average W.N.W. and E.S.E. strike,\r\nis about forty miles in a north and south line, and ninety miles in an\r\neast and west line.\r\n\r\nFurther northward, near Port Famine, the stratification of the\r\nclay-slate and of the associated rocks, is well defined, and there\r\nalone the cleavage and strata-planes are parallel. A little north of\r\nthis port there is an anticlinal axis ranging N.W. (or a little more\r\nwesterly) and S.E.: south of the port, as far as Admiralty Sound and\r\nGabriel Channel, the outline of the land clearly indicates the\r\nexistence of several lines of elevation in this same N.W. direction,\r\nwhich, I may add, is so uniform in the western half of the St. of\r\nMagellan, that, as Captain King has remarked, “a parallel ruler placed\r\non the map upon the projecting points of the south shore, and extended\r\nacross the strait, will also touch the headlands on the opposite\r\ncoast.” (“Geographical Journal” volume 1 page 170.) It would appear,\r\nfrom Captain King’s observations, that over all this area the cleavage\r\nextends in the same line. Deep-water channels, however, in all parts of\r\nTierra del Fuego have burst through the trammels both of stratification\r\nand cleavage; most of them may have been formed during the elevation of\r\nthe land by long- continued erosion, but others, for instance the\r\nBeagle Channel, which stretches like a narrow canal for 120 miles\r\nobliquely through the mountains, can hardly have thus originated.\r\n\r\nFinally, we have seen that in the extreme eastern point of Tierra del\r\nFuego, the cleavage and coast-lines extend W. and E. and even W.S.W.\r\nand E.N.E.: over a large area westward, the cleavage, the main range of\r\nmountains, and some subordinate ranges, but not the outlines of the\r\ncoast, strike W.N.W., and E.S.E.: in the central and western parts of\r\nthe St. of Magellan, the stratification, the mountain-ranges, the\r\noutlines of the coast, and the cleavage all strike nearly N.W. and S.E.\r\nNorth of the strait, the outline of the coast, and the mountains on the\r\nmainland, run nearly north and south. Hence we see, at this southern\r\npoint of the continent, how gradually the Cordillera bend, from their\r\nnorth and south course of so many thousand miles in length, into an E.\r\nand even E.N.E. direction.\r\n\r\nWEST COAST, FROM THE SOUTHERN CHONOS ISLANDS TO NORTHERN CHILE.\r\n\r\nThe first place at which we landed north of the St. of Magellan was\r\nnear Cape Tres Montes, in latitude 47 degrees S. Between this point and\r\nthe Northern Chonos Islands, a distance of 200 miles, the “Beagle”\r\nvisited several points, and specimens were collected for me from the\r\nintermediate spaces by Lieutenant Stokes. The predominant rock is\r\nmica-slate, with thick folia of quartz, very frequently alternating\r\nwith and passing into a chloritic, or into a black, glossy, often\r\nstriated, slightly anthracitic schist, which soils paper, and becomes\r\nwhite under a great heat, and then fuses. Thin layers of feldspar,\r\nswelling at intervals into well crystallised kernels, are sometimes\r\nincluded in these black schists; and I observed one mass of the\r\nordinary black variety insensibly lose its fissile structure, and pass\r\ninto a singular mixture of chlorite, epidote, feldspar, and mica. Great\r\nveins of quartz are numerous in the mica-schists; wherever these occur\r\nthe folia are much convoluted. In the southern part of the Peninsula of\r\nTres Montes, a compact altered feldspathic rock with crystals of\r\nfeldspar and grains of quartz is the commonest variety; this rock\r\nexhibits occasionally traces of an original brecciated structure, and\r\noften presents (like the altered state of Tierra del Fuego) traces of\r\ncleavage- planes, which strike in the same direction with the folia of\r\nmica-schist further northward. (The peculiar, abruptly conical form of\r\nthe hills in this neighbourhood, would have led any one at first to\r\nhave supposed that they had been formed of injected or intrusive rocks.\r\nAt Inchemo Island, a similar rock gradually becomes granulo-crystalline\r\nand acquires scales of mica; and this variety at S. Estevan becomes\r\nhighly laminated, and though still exhibiting some rounded grains of\r\nquartz, passes into the black, glossy, slightly anthracitic schist,\r\nwhich, as we have seen, repeatedly alternates with and passes into the\r\nmicaceous and chloritic schists. Hence all the rocks on this line of\r\ncoast belong to one series, and insensibly vary from an altered\r\nfeldspathic clay-slate into largely foliated, true mica-schist.\r\n\r\nThe cleavage of the homogeneous schists, the foliation of those\r\ncomposed of more or less distinct minerals in layers, and the planes of\r\nalternation of the different varieties or so-called stratification, are\r\nall parallel, and preserve over this 200 miles of coast a remarkable\r\ndegree of uniformity in direction. At the northern end of the group, at\r\nLow’s Harbour, the well- defined folia of mica-schist everywhere ranged\r\nwithin eight degrees (or less than one point of the compass) of N. 19\r\ndegrees W. and S. 19 degrees E.; and even the point of dip varied very\r\nlittle, being always directed to the west and generally at an angle of\r\nforty degrees; I should mention that I had here good opportunities of\r\nobservation, for I followed the naked rock on the beach, transversely\r\nto the strike, for a distance of four miles and a half, and all the way\r\nattended to the dip. Along the outer islands for 100 miles south of\r\nLow’s Harbour, Lieutenant Stokes, during his boat- survey, kindly\r\nobserved for me the strike of the foliation, and he assures me that it\r\nwas invariably northerly, and the dip with one single exception to the\r\nwest. Further south at Vallenar Bay, the strike was almost universally\r\nN. 25 degrees W. and the dip, generally at an angle of about 40 degrees\r\nto W. 25 degrees S., but in some places almost vertical. Still farther\r\nsouth, in the neighbourhood of the harbours of Anna Pink, S. Estevan\r\nand S. Andres, and (judging from a distance) along the southern part of\r\nTres Montes, the foliation and cleavage extended in a line between [N.\r\n11 degrees to 22 degrees W.] and [S. 11 degrees to 22 degrees E.]; and\r\nthe planes dipped generally westerly, but often easterly, at angles\r\nvarying from a gentle inclination to vertical. At A. Pink’s Harbour,\r\nwhere the schists generally dipped easterly, wherever the angle became\r\nvery high, the strike changed from N. 11 degrees W. to even as much as\r\nN. 45 degrees W.: in an analogous manner at Vallenar Bay, where the dip\r\nwas westerly (viz. on an average directed to W. 25 degrees S.), as soon\r\nas the angle became very high, the planes struck in a line more than 25\r\ndegrees west of north. The average result from all the observations on\r\nthis 200 miles of coast, is a strike of N. 19 degrees W. and S. 19\r\ndegrees E.: considering that in each specified place my examination\r\nextended over an area of several miles, and that Lieutenant Stokes’\r\nobservations apply to a length of 100 miles, I think this remarkable\r\nuniformity is pretty well established. The prevalence, throughout the\r\nnorthern half of this line of coast, of a dip in one direction, that is\r\nto the west, instead of being sometimes west and sometimes east, is,\r\njudging from what I have elsewhere seen, an unusual circumstance. In\r\nBrazil, La Plata, the Falkland Islands, and Tierra del Fuego, there is\r\ngenerally an obvious relation between the axis of elevation, the\r\noutline of the coast, and the strike of the cleavage or foliation: in\r\nthe Chonos Archipelago, however, neither the minor details of the\r\ncoast-line, nor the chain of the Cordillera, nor the subordinate\r\ntransverse mountain-axes, accord with the strike of the foliation and\r\ncleavage: the seaward face of the numerous islands composing this\r\nArchipelago, and apparently the line of the Cordillera, range N. 11\r\ndegrees E., whereas, as we have just seen, the average strike of the\r\nfoliation is N. 19 degrees W.\r\n\r\nThere is one interesting exception to the uniformity in the strike of\r\nthe foliation. At the northern point of Tres Montes (latitude 45\r\ndegrees 52 minutes) a bold chain of granite, between two and three\r\nthousand feet in height, runs from the coast far into the interior, in\r\nan E.S.E. line, or more strictly E. 28 degrees S. and W. 28 degrees N.\r\n(In the distance, other mountains could be seen apparently ranging\r\nN.N.E. and S.S.W. at right angles to this one. I may add, that not far\r\nfrom Vallenar Bay there is a fine range, apparently of granite, which\r\nhas burst through the mica-slate in a N.E. by E. and S.W. by S. line.)\r\nIn a bay, at the northern foot of this range, there are a few islets of\r\nmica-slate, with the folia in some parts horizontal, but mostly\r\ninclined at an average angle of 20 degrees to the north. On the\r\nnorthern steep flank of the range, there are a few patches (some quite\r\nisolated, and not larger than half a-crown!) of the mica-schist,\r\nfoliated with the same northerly dip. On the broad summit, as far as\r\nthe southern crest, there is much mica-slate, in some places even 400\r\nfeet in thickness, with the folia all dipping north, at angles varying\r\nfrom 5 degrees to 20 degrees, but sometimes mounting up to 30 degrees.\r\nThe southern flank consists of bare granite. The mica-slate is\r\npenetrated by small veins of granite, branching from the main body.\r\n(The granite within these veins, as well as generally at the junction\r\nwith the mica-slate, is more quartzose than elsewhere. The granite, I\r\nmay add, is traversed by dikes running for a very great length in the\r\nline of the mountains; they are composed of a somewhat laminated\r\neurite, containing crystals of feldspar, hornblende, and octagons of\r\nquartz.) Leaving out of view the prevalent strike of the folia in other\r\nparts of this Archipelago, it might have been expected that they would\r\nhave dipped N. 28 degrees E., that is directly from the ridge, and,\r\nconsidering its abruptness, at a high inclination; but the real dip, as\r\nwe have just seen, both at the foot and on the northern flank, and over\r\nthe entire summit, is at a small angle, and directed nearly due north.\r\nFrom these considerations it occurred to me, that perhaps we here had\r\nthe novel and curious case of already inclined laminae obliquely tilted\r\nat a subsequent period by the granitic axis. Mr. Hopkins, so well known\r\nfrom his mathematical investigations, has most kindly calculated the\r\nproblem: the proposition sent was,—Take a district composed of laminae,\r\ndipping at an angle of 40 degrees to W. 19 degrees S., and let an axis\r\nof elevation traverse it in an E. 28 degrees S. line, what will the\r\nposition of the laminae be on the northern flank after a tilt, we will\r\nfirst suppose, of 45 degrees? Mr. Hopkins informs me, that the angle of\r\nthe dip will be 28 degrees 31 minutes, and its direction to north 30\r\ndegrees 33 minutes west. (On the south side of the axis (where,\r\nhowever, I did not see any mica-slate) the dip of the folia would be at\r\nan angle of 77 degrees 55 minutes, directed to west 35 degrees 33\r\nminutes south. Hence the two points of dip on the opposite sides of the\r\nrange, instead of being as in ordinary cases directly opposed to each\r\nother at an angle of 180 degrees, would here be only 86 degrees 50\r\nminutes apart.) By varying the supposed angle of the tilt, our\r\npreviously inclined folia can be thrown into any angle between 26\r\ndegrees, which is the least possible angle, and 90 degrees; but if a\r\nsmall inclination be thus given to them, their point of dip will depart\r\nfar from the north, and therefore not accord with the actual position\r\nof the folia of mica-schist on our granitic range. Hence it appears\r\nvery difficult, without varying considerably the elements of the\r\nproblem, thus to explain the anomalous strike and dip of the foliated\r\nmica- schist, especially in those parts, namely, at the base of the\r\nrange, where the folia are almost horizontal. Mr. Hopkins, however,\r\nadds, that great irregularities and lateral thrusts might be expected\r\nin every great line of elevation, and that these would account for\r\nconsiderable deviations from the calculated results: considering that\r\nthe granitic axis, as shown by the veins, has indisputably been\r\ninjected after the perfect formation of the mica-slate, and considering\r\nthe uniformity of the strike of the folia throughout the rest of the\r\nArchipelago, I cannot but still think that their anomalous position at\r\nthis one point is someway directly and mechanically related to the\r\nintrusion of this W.N.W. and E.S.E. mountain-chain of granite.\r\n\r\nDikes are frequent in the metamorphic schists of the Chonos Islands,\r\nand seem feebly to represent that great band of trappean and ancient\r\nvolcanic rocks on the south-western coast of Tierra del Fuego. At S.\r\nAndres I observed in the space of half-a-mile, seven broad, parallel\r\ndikes, composed of three varieties of trap, running in a N.W. and S.E.\r\nline, parallel to the neighbouring mountain-ranges of altered\r\nclay-slate; but they must be of long subsequent origin to these\r\nmountains; for they intersected the volcanic formation described in the\r\nlast chapter. North of Tres Montes, I noticed three dikes differing\r\nfrom each other in composition, one of them having a euritic base\r\nincluding large octagons of quartz; these dikes, as well as several of\r\nporphyritic greenstone at Vallenar Bay, extended N.E. and S.W., nearly\r\nat right angles to the foliation of the schists, but in the line of\r\ntheir joints. At Low’s Harbour, however, a set of great parallel dikes,\r\none ninety yards and another sixty yards in width, have been guided by\r\nthe foliation of the mica-schist, and hence are inclined westward at an\r\nangle of 45 degrees: these dikes are formed of various porphyritic\r\ntraps, some of which are remarkable from containing numerous rounded\r\ngrains of quartz. A porphyritic trap of this latter kind, passed in one\r\nof the dikes into a most curious hornstone, perfectly white, with a\r\nwaxy fracture and pellucid edges, fusible, and containing many grains\r\nof quartz and specks of iron pyrites. In the ninety-yard dike several\r\nlarge, apparently now quite isolated, fragments of mica-slate were\r\nembedded: but as their foliation was exactly parallel to that of the\r\nsurrounding solid rock, no doubt these new separate fragments\r\noriginally formed wedge-shaped depending portions of a continuous vault\r\nor crust, once extending over the dike, but since worn down and\r\ndenuded.\r\n\r\nCHILOE, VALDIVIA, CONCEPCION.\r\n\r\nIn Chiloe, a great formation of mica-schist strikingly resembles that\r\nof the Chonos Islands. For a space of eleven miles on the S.E. coast,\r\nthe folia were very distinct, though slightly convoluted, and ranged\r\nwithin a point of N.N.W. and S.S.E., dipping either E.N.E. or more\r\ncommonly W.S.W., at an average angle of 22 degrees (in one spot,\r\nhowever, at 60 degrees), and therefore decidedly at a lesser\r\ninclination than amongst the Chonos Islands. On the west and\r\nnorth-western shores, the foliation was often obscure, though, where\r\nbest defined, it ranged within a point of N. by W. and S. by E.,\r\ndipping either easterly or westerly, at varying and generally very\r\nsmall angles. Hence, from the southern part of Tres Montes to the\r\nnorthern end of Chiloe, a distance of 300 miles, we have closely allied\r\nrocks with their folia striking on an average in the same direction,\r\nnamely between N. 11 degrees and 22 degrees W. Again, at Valdivia, we\r\nmeet with the same mica-schist, exhibiting nearly the same\r\nmineralogical passages as in the Chonos Archipelago, often, however,\r\nbecoming more ferruginous, and containing so much feldspar as to pass\r\ninto gneiss. The folia were generally well defined; but nowhere else in\r\nSouth America did I see them varying so much in direction: this seemed\r\nchiefly caused by their forming parts, as I could sometimes distinctly\r\ntrace, of large flat curves: nevertheless, both near the settlement and\r\ntowards the interior, a N.W. and S.E. strike seemed more frequent than\r\nany other direction; the angle of the dip was generally small. At\r\nConcepcion, a highly glossy clay-slate had its cleavage often slightly\r\ncurvilinear, and inclined, seldom at a high angle, towards various\r\npoints of the compass: but here, as at Valdivia, a N.W. and S.E. strike\r\nseemed to be the most frequent one. ((FIGURE 23.) I observed in some\r\nparts that the tops of the laminae of the clay-slate (b in Figure 23)\r\nunder the superficial detritus and soil (a) were bent, sometimes\r\nwithout being broken, as represented in Figure 23, which is copied from\r\none given by Sir H. De la Beche (page 42 “Geological Manual”) of an\r\nexactly similar phenomenon in Devonshire. Mr. R.A.C. Austen, also, in\r\nhis excellent paper on S.E. Devon (“Geological Transactions” volume 6\r\npage 437), has described this phenomenon; he attributes it to the\r\naction of frosts, but at the same time doubts whether the frosts of the\r\npresent day penetrate to a sufficient depth. As it is known that\r\nearthquakes particularly affect the surface of the ground, it occurred\r\nto me that this appearance might perhaps be due, at least at\r\nConcepcion, to their frequent occurrence; the superficial layers of\r\ndetritus being either jerked in one direction, or, where the surface\r\nwas inclined, pushed a little downwards during each strong vibration.\r\nIn North Wales I have seen a somewhat analogous but less regular\r\nappearance, though on a greater scale (“London Philosophical Magazine”\r\nvolume 21 page 184), and produced by a quite different cause, namely,\r\nby the stranding of great icebergs; this latter appearance has also\r\nbeen observed in N. America.)\r\n\r\nIn certain spots large quartz veins were numerous, and near them, the\r\ncleavage, as was the case with the foliation of the schists in the\r\nChonos Archipelago, became extremely tortuous.\r\n\r\nAt the northern end of Quiriquina Island, in the Bay of Concepcion, at\r\nleast eight rudely parallel dikes, which have been guided to a certain\r\nextent by the cleavage of the slate, occur within the space of a\r\nquarter of a mile. They vary much in composition, resembling in many\r\nrespects the dikes at Low’s Harbour: the greater number consist of\r\nfeldspathic porphyries, sometimes containing grains of quartz: one,\r\nhowever, was black and brilliant, like an augitic rock, but really\r\nformed of feldspar; others of a feldspathic nature were perfectly\r\nwhite, with either an earthy or crystalline fracture, and including\r\ngrains and regular octagons of quartz; these white varieties passed\r\ninto ordinary greenstones. Although, both here and at Low’s Harbour,\r\nthe nature of the rock varied considerably in the same dike, yet I\r\ncannot but think that at these two places and in other parts of the\r\nChonos group, where the dikes, though close to each other and running\r\nparallel, are of different composition, that they must have been formed\r\nat different periods. In the case of Quiriquina this is a rather\r\ninteresting conclusion, for these eight parallel dikes cut through the\r\nmetamorphic schists in a N.W. and S.E. line, and since their injection\r\nthe overlying cretaceous or tertiary strata have been tilted (whilst\r\nstill under the sea) from a N.W. by N. and S.E. by S. line; and again,\r\nduring the great earthquake of February 1835, the ground in this\r\nneighbourhood was fissured in N.W. and S.E. lines; and from the manner\r\nin which buildings were thrown down, it was evident that the surface\r\nundulated in this same direction. (“Geological Transactions” volume 6\r\npages 602 and 617. “Journal of Researches” 2nd edition page 307.)\r\n\r\nCENTRAL AND NORTHERN CHILE.\r\n\r\nNorthward of Concepcion, as far as Copiapo, the shores of the Pacific\r\nconsist, with the exception of some small tertiary basins, of gneiss,\r\nmica- schist, altered clay-slate, granite, greenstone and syenite:\r\nhence the coast from Tres Montes to Copiapo, a distance of 1,200 miles,\r\nand I have reason to believe for a much greater space, is almost\r\nsimilarly constituted.\r\n\r\nNear Valparaiso the prevailing rock is gneiss, generally including much\r\nhornblende: concretionary balls formed of feldspar, hornblende and\r\nmica, from two or three feet in diameter, are in very many places\r\nconformably enfolded by the foliated gneiss: veins of quartz and\r\nfeldspar, including black schorl and well-crystallised epidote, are\r\nnumerous. Epidote likewise occurs in the gneiss in thin layers,\r\nparallel to the foliation of the mass. One large vein of a coarse\r\ngranitic character was remarkable from in one part quite changing its\r\ncharacter, and insensibly passing into a blackish porphyry, including\r\nacicular crystals of glassy feldspar and of hornblende: I have never\r\nseen any other such case. (Humboldt “Personal Narrative” volume 4 page\r\n60, has described with much surprise, concretionary balls, with\r\nconcentric divisions, composed of partially vitreous feldspar,\r\nhornblende, and garnets, included within great veins of gneiss, which\r\ncut across the mica-slate near Venezuela.)\r\n\r\nI shall in the few following remarks on the rocks of Chile allude\r\nexclusively to their foliation and cleavage. In the gneiss round\r\nValparaiso the strike of the foliation is very variable, but I think\r\nabout N. by W. and S. by E. is the commonest direction; this likewise\r\nholds good with the cleavage of the altered feldspathic clay-slates,\r\noccasionally met with on the coast for ninety miles north of\r\nValparaiso. Some feldspathic slate, alternating with strata of\r\nclaystone porphyry in the Bell of Quillota and at Jajuel, and\r\ntherefore, perhaps, belonging to a later period than the metamorphic\r\nschists on the coast, cleaved in this same direction. In the Eastern\r\nCordillera, in the Portillo Pass, there is a grand mass of mica- slate,\r\nfoliated in a north and south line, and with a high westerly dip: in\r\nthe Uspallata range, clay-slate and grauwacke have a highly inclined,\r\nnearly north and south cleavage, though in some parts the strike is\r\nirregular: in the main or Cumbre range, the direction of the cleavage\r\nin the feldspathic clay-slate is N.W. and S.E.\r\n\r\nBetween Coquimbo and Guasco there are two considerable formations of\r\nmica- slate, in one of which the rock passed sometimes into common\r\nclay-slate and sometimes into a glossy black variety, very like that in\r\nthe Chonos Archipelago. The folia and cleavage of these rocks ranged\r\nbetween [N. and N.W. by N.] and [S. and S.W. by S.]. Near the Port of\r\nGuasco several varieties of altered clay-slate have a quite irregular\r\ncleavage. Between Guasco and Copiapo, there are some siliceous and\r\ntalcaceous slates cleaving in a north and south line, with an easterly\r\ndip of between 60 and 70 degrees: high up, also, the main valley of\r\nCopiapo, there is mica-slate with a high easterly dip. In the whole\r\nspace between Valparaiso and Copiapo an easterly dip is much more\r\ncommon than an opposite or westerly one.\r\n\r\nCONCLUDING REMARKS ON CLEAVAGE AND FOLIATION.\r\n\r\nIn this southern part of the southern hemisphere, we have seen that the\r\ncleavage-laminae range over wide areas with remarkable uniformity,\r\ncutting straight through the planes of stratification, but yet being\r\nparallel in strike to the main axes of elevation, and generally to the\r\noutlines of the coast. (In my paper on the Falkland Islands “Geological\r\nJournal” volume 3 page 267, I have given a curious case on the\r\nauthority of Captain Sulivan, R.N., of much folded beds of clay-slate,\r\nin some of which the cleavage is perpendicular to the horizon, and in\r\nothers it is perpendicular to each curvature or fold of the bed: this\r\nappears a new case.) The dip, however, is as variable, both in angle\r\nand in direction (that is, sometimes being inclined to the one side and\r\nsometimes to the directly opposite side), as the strike is uniform. In\r\nall these respects there is a close agreement with the facts given by\r\nProfessor Sedgwick in his celebrated memoir in the “Geological\r\nTransactions,” and by Sir R.I. Murchison in his various excellent\r\ndiscussions on this subject. The Falkland Islands, and more especially\r\nTierra del Fuego, offer striking instances of the lines of cleavage,\r\nthe principle axes of elevation, and the outlines of the coast,\r\ngradually changing together their courses. The direction which prevails\r\nthroughout Tierra del Fuego and the Falkland Islands, namely, from west\r\nwith some northing to east with some southing, is also common to the\r\nseveral ridges in Northern Patagonia and in the western parts of Banda\r\nOriental: in this latter province, in the Sierra Tapalguen, and in the\r\nWestern Falkland Island, the W. by N., or W.N.W. and E.S.E., ridges,\r\nare crossed at right angles by others ranging N.N.E. and S.S.W.\r\n\r\nThe fact of the cleavage-laminae in the clay-slate of Tierra del Fuego,\r\nwhere seen cutting straight through the planes of stratification, and\r\nwhere consequently there could be no doubt about their nature,\r\ndiffering slightly in colour, texture, and hardness, appears to me very\r\ninteresting. In a thick mass of laminated, feldspathic and altered\r\nclay-slate, interposed between two great strata of porphyritic\r\nconglomerate in Central Chile, and where there could be but little\r\ndoubt about the bedding, I observed similar slight differences in\r\ncomposition, and likewise some distinct thin layers of epidote,\r\nparallel to the highly inclined cleavage of the mass. Again, I\r\nincidentally noticed in North Wales, where glaciers had passed over the\r\ntruncated edges of the highly inclined laminae of clay-slate, that the\r\nsurface, though smooth, was worn into small parallel undulations,\r\ncaused by the competent laminae being of slightly different degrees of\r\nhardness. (“London Philosophical Magazine” volume 21 page 182.) With\r\nreference to the slates of North Wales, Professor Sedgwick describes\r\nthe planes of cleavage, as “coated over with chlorite and\r\nsemi-crystalline matter, which not only merely define the planes in\r\nquestion, but strike in parallel flakes through the whole mass of the\r\nrock.” (“Geological Transactions” volume 3 page 471.) In some of those\r\nglossy and hard varieties of clay-slate, which may often be seen\r\npassing into mica-schist, it has appeared to me that the cleavage-\r\nplanes were formed of excessively thin, generally slighted convoluted,\r\nfolia, composed of microscopically minute scales of mica. From these\r\nseveral facts, and more especially from the case of the clay-slate in\r\nTierra del Fuego, it must, I think, be concluded, that the same power\r\nwhich has impressed on the slate its fissile structure or cleavage has\r\ntended to modify its mineralogical character in parallel planes.\r\n\r\nLet us now turn to the foliation of the metamorphic schists, a subject\r\nwhich has been much less attended to. As in the case of\r\ncleavage-laminae, the folia preserve over very large areas a uniform\r\nstrike: thus Humboldt found for a distance of 300 miles in Venezuela,\r\nand indeed over a much larger space, gneiss, granite, mica, and\r\nclay-slate, striking very uniformly N.E. and S.W., and dipping at an\r\nangle of between 60 and 70 degrees to N.W. (“Personal Narrative” volume\r\n6 page 59 et seq.); it would even appear from the facts given in this\r\nchapter, that the metamorphic rocks throughout the north-eastern part\r\nof South America are generally foliated within two points of N.E. and\r\nS.W. Over the eastern parts of Banda Oriental, the foliation strikes\r\nwith a high inclination, very uniformly N.N.E. to S.S.W., and over the\r\nwestern parts, in a W. by N. and E. by S. line. For a space of 300\r\nmiles on the shores of the Chonos and Chiloe Islands, we have seen that\r\nthe foliation seldom deviates more than a point of the compass from a\r\nN. 19 degrees W. and S. 19 degrees E. strike. As in the case of\r\ncleavage, the angle of the dip in foliated rocks is generally high but\r\nvariable, and alternates from one side of the line of strike to the\r\nother side, sometimes being vertical: in the Northern Chonos Islands,\r\nhowever, the folia are inclined almost always to the west; in nearly\r\nthe same manner, the cleavage-laminae in Southern Tierra del Fuego\r\ncertainly dip much more frequently to S.S.W. than to the opposite\r\npoint. In Eastern Banda Oriental, in parts of Brazil, and in some other\r\ndistricts, the foliation runs in the same direction with the\r\nmountain-ranges and adjoining coast-lines: amongst the Chonos Islands,\r\nhowever, this coincidence fails, and I have given my reasons for\r\nsuspecting that one granitic axis has burst through and tilted the\r\nalready inclined folia of mica-schist: in the case of cleavage, the\r\ncoincidence between its strike and that of the main stratification\r\nseems sometimes to fail. (Cases are given by Mr. Jukes in his “Geology\r\nof Newfoundland” page 130.) Foliation and cleavage resemble each other\r\nin the planes winding round concretions, and in becoming tortuous where\r\nveins of quartz abound. (I have seen in Brazil and Chile concretions\r\nthus enfolded by foliated gneiss; and Macculloch “Highlands” volume 1\r\npage 64, has described a similar case. For analogous cases in\r\nclay-slate, see Professor Henslow’s Memoir in “Cambridge Philosophical\r\nTransactions” volume 1 page 379, and Macculloch’s “Classification of\r\nRocks” page 351. With respect to both foliation and cleavage becoming\r\ntortuous where quartz-veins abound, I have seen instances near Monte\r\nVideo, at Concepcion, and in the Chonos Islands. See also Mr.\r\nGreenough’s “Critical Examination” page 78.) On the flanks of the\r\nmountains both in Tierra del Fuego and in other countries, I have\r\nobserved that the cleavage-planes frequently dip at a high angle\r\ninwards; and this was long ago observed by Von Buch to be the case in\r\nNorway: this fact is perhaps analogous to the folded, fan-like or\r\nradiating structure in the metamorphic schists of the Alps, in which\r\nthe folia in the central crests are vertical and on the two flanks\r\ninclined inwards. (Studer in “Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal”\r\nvolume 23 page 144.) Where masses of fissile and foliated rocks\r\nalternate together, the cleavage and foliation, in all cases which I\r\nhave seen, are parallel. Where in one district the rocks are fissile,\r\nand in another adjoining district they are foliated, the planes of\r\ncleavage and foliation are likewise generally parallel: this is the\r\ncase with the feldspathic homogeneous slates in the southern part of\r\nthe Chonos group, compared with the fine foliated mica-schists of the\r\nnorthern part; so again the clay- slate of the whole eastern side of\r\nTierra del Fuego cleaves in exactly the same line with the foliated\r\ngneiss and mica-slate of the western coast; other analogous instances\r\nmight have been adduced. (I have given a case in Australia. See my\r\n“Volcanic Islands.”)\r\n\r\nWith respect to the origin of the folia of quartz, mica, feldspar, and\r\nother minerals composing the metamorphic schists, Professor Sedgwick,\r\nMr. Lyell, and most authors believe, that the constituent parts of each\r\nlayer were separately deposited as sediment, and then metamorphosed.\r\nThis view, in the majority of cases, I believe to be quite untenable.\r\nIn those not uncommon instances, where a mass of clay-slate, in\r\napproaching granite, gradually passes into gneiss, we clearly see that\r\nfolia of distinct minerals can originate through the metamorphosis of a\r\nhomogeneous fissile rock. (I have described in “Volcanic Islands” a\r\ngood instance of such a passage at the Cape of Good Hope.) The\r\ndeposition, it may be remarked, of numberless alternations of pure\r\nquartz, and of the elements of mica or feldspar does not appear a\r\nprobable event. (See some excellent remarks on this subject, in\r\nD’Aubuisson’s “Traite de Geog.” tome 1 page 297. Also some remarks by\r\nMr. Dana in “Silliman’s American Journal” volume 45 page 108.) In those\r\ndistricts in which the metamorphic schists are foliated in planes\r\nparallel to the cleavage of the rocks in an adjoining district, are we\r\nto believe that the folia are due to sedimentary layers, whilst the\r\ncleavage- laminae, though parallel, have no relation whatever to such\r\nplanes of deposition? On this view, how can we reconcile the vastness\r\nof the areas over which the strike of the foliation is uniform, with\r\nwhat we see in disturbed districts composed of true strata: and\r\nespecially, how can we understand the high and even vertical dip\r\nthroughout many wide districts, which are not mountainous, and\r\nthroughout some, as in Western Banda Oriental, which are not even\r\nhilly? Are we to admit that in the northern part of the Chonos\r\nArchipelago, mica-slate was first accumulated in parallel horizontal\r\nfolia to a thickness of about four geographical miles, and then\r\nupturned at an angle of forty degrees; whilst, in the southern part of\r\nthis same Archipelago, the cleavage-laminae of closely allied rocks,\r\nwhich none would imagine had ever been horizontal, dip at nearly the\r\nsame angle, to nearly the same point?\r\n\r\nSeeing, then, that foliated schists indisputably are sometimes produced\r\nby the metamorphosis of homogeneous fissile rocks; seeing that\r\nfoliation and cleavage are so closely analogous in the several\r\nabove-enumerated respects; seeing that some fissile and almost\r\nhomogeneous rocks show incipient mineralogical changes along the planes\r\nof their cleavage, and that other rocks with a fissile structure\r\nalternate with, and pass into varieties with a foliated structure, I\r\ncannot doubt that in most cases foliation and cleavage are parts of the\r\nsame process: in cleavage there being only an incipient separation of\r\nthe constituent minerals; in foliation a much more complete separation\r\nand crystallisation.\r\n\r\nThe fact often referred to in this chapter, of the foliation and the\r\nso- called strata in the metamorphic series,—that is, the alternating\r\nmasses of different varieties of gneiss, mica-schist, and\r\nhornblende-slate, etc.,—being parallel to each other, at first appears\r\nquite opposed to the view, that the folia have no relation to the\r\nplanes of original deposition. Where the so-called beds are not very\r\nthick and of widely different mineralogical composition from each\r\nother, I do not think that there is any difficulty in supposing that\r\nthey have originated in an analogous manner with the separate folia. We\r\nshould bear in mind what thick strata, in ordinary sedimentary masses,\r\nhave obviously been formed by a concretionary process. In a pile of\r\nvolcanic rocks on the Island of Ascension, there are strata, differing\r\nquite as much in appearance as the ordinary varieties of the\r\nmetamorphic schists, which undoubtedly have been produced, not by\r\nsuccessive flowings of lava, but by internal molecular changes. Near\r\nMonte Video, where the stratification, as it would be called, of the\r\nmetamorphic series is, in most parts, particularly well developed,\r\nbeing as usual, parallel to the foliation, we have seen that a mass of\r\nchloritic schist, netted with quartz-veins, is entangled in gneiss, in\r\nsuch a manner as to show that it had certainly originated in some\r\nprocess of segregation: again, in another spot, the gneiss tended to\r\npass into hornblendic schist by alternating with layers of quartz; but\r\nthese layers of quartz almost certainly had never been separately\r\ndeposited, for they were absolutely continuous with the numerous\r\nintersecting veins of quartz. I have never had an opportunity of\r\ntracing for any distance, along the line both of strike and of dip, the\r\nso-called beds in the metamorphic schists, but I strongly suspect that\r\nthey would not be found to extend with the same character, very far in\r\nthe line either of their dip or strike. Hence I am led to believe, that\r\nmost of the so-called beds are of the nature of complex folia, and have\r\nnot been separately deposited. Of course, this view cannot be extended\r\nto THICK masses included in the metamorphic series, which are of\r\ntotally different composition from the adjoining schists, and which are\r\nfar extended, as is sometimes the case with quartz and marble; these\r\nmust generally be of the nature of true strata. (Macculloch\r\n“Classification of Rocks” page 364, states that primary limestones are\r\noften found in irregular masses or great nodules, “which can scarcely\r\nbe said to possess a stratified shape!”) Such strata, however, will\r\nalmost always strike in the same direction with the folia, owing to the\r\naxes of elevation being in most countries parallel to the strike of the\r\nfoliation; but they will generally dip at a different angle from that\r\nof the foliation; and the angle of the foliation in itself almost\r\nalways varies much: hence, in crossing a metamorphosed schistose\r\ndistrict, it would require especial attention to discriminate between\r\ntrue strata of deposition and complex foliated masses. The mere\r\npresence of true strata in the midst of a set of metamorphic schists,\r\nis no argument that the foliation is of sedimentary origin, without it\r\nbe further shown in each case, that the folia not only strike, but dip\r\nthroughout in parallel planes with those of the true stratification.\r\n\r\nAs in some cases it appears that where a fissile rock has been exposed\r\nto partial metamorphic action, for instance from the irruption of\r\ngranite, the foliation has supervened on the already existing\r\ncleavage-planes; so perhaps in some instances, the foliation of a rock\r\nmay have been determined by the original planes of deposition or of\r\noblique current-laminae: I have, however, myself, never seen such a\r\ncase, and I must maintain that in most extensive metamorphic areas, the\r\nfoliation is the extreme result of that process, of which cleavage is\r\nthe first effect. That foliation may arise without any previous\r\nstructural arrangement in the mass, we may infer from injected, and\r\ntherefore once liquified, rocks, both of volcanic and plutonic origin,\r\nsometimes having a “grain” (as expressed by Professor Sedgwick), and\r\nsometimes being composed of distinct folia or laminae of different\r\ncompositions. In my work on “Volcanic Islands,” I have given several\r\ninstances of this structure in volcanic rocks, and it is not uncommonly\r\nseen in plutonic masses—thus, in the Cordillera of Chile, there are\r\ngigantic mountain-like masses of red granite, which have been injected\r\nwhilst liquified, and which, nevertheless, display in parts a decidedly\r\nlaminar structure. (As remarked in a former part of this chapter, I\r\nsuspect that the boldly conical mountains of gneiss-granite, near Rio\r\nde Janeiro, in which the constituent minerals are arranged in parallel\r\nplanes, are of intrusive origin. We must not, however, forget the\r\nlesson of caution taught by the curious claystone porphyries of Port\r\nDesire, in which we have seen that the breaking up and aggregation of a\r\nthinly stratified tufaceous mass, has yielded a rock semi-porphyritic\r\nwith crystals of feldspar, arranged in the planes of original\r\ndeposition.)\r\n\r\nFinally, we have seen that the planes of cleavage and of foliation,\r\nthat is, of the incipient process and of the final result, generally\r\nstrike parallel to the principal axes of elevation, and to the outline\r\nof the land: the strike of the axes of elevation (that is, of the lines\r\nof fissures with the strata on their edges upturned), according to the\r\nreasoning of Mr. Hopkins, is determined by the form of the area\r\nundergoing changes of level, and the consequent direction of the lines\r\nof tension and fissure. Now, in that remarkable pile of volcanic rocks\r\nat Ascension, which has several times been alluded to (and in some\r\nother cases), I have endeavoured to show, that the lamination of the\r\nseveral varieties, and their alternations, have been caused by the\r\nmoving mass, just before its final consolidation, having been subjected\r\n(as in a glacier) to planes of different tension; this difference in\r\nthe tension affecting the crystalline and concretionary processes. (In\r\n“Volcanic Islands.”) One of the varieties of rock thus produced at\r\nAscension, at first sight, singularly resembles a fine-grained gneiss;\r\nit consists of quite straight and parallel zones of excessive tenuity,\r\nof more or less coloured crystallised feldspar, of distinct crystals of\r\nquartz, diopside, and oxide of iron. These considerations,\r\nnotwithstanding the experiments made by Mr. Fox, showing the influence\r\nof electrical currents in producing a structure like that of cleavage,\r\nand notwithstanding the apparently inexplicable variation, both in the\r\ninclination of the cleavage-laminae and in their dipping first to one\r\nside and then to the other side of the line of strike, lead me to\r\nsuspect that the planes of cleavage and foliation are intimately\r\nconnected with the planes of different tension, to which the area was\r\nlong subjected, AFTER the main fissures or axes of upheavement had been\r\nformed, but BEFORE the final consolidation of the mass and the total\r\ncessation of all molecular movement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\nCENTRAL CHILE:—STRUCTURE OF THE CORDILLERA.\r\n\r\n\r\nCentral Chile.—Basal formations of the Cordillera.—Origin of the\r\nporphyritic clay-stone conglomerate.—Andesite.—Volcanic rocks.—Section\r\nof the Cordillera by the Peuquenes are Portillo Pass.—Great gypseous\r\nformation.—Peuquenes line; thickness of strata, fossils of.—Portillo\r\nline.—Conglomerate, orthitic granite, mica-schist, volcanic rocks\r\nof.—Concluding remarks on the denudation and elevation of the Portillo\r\nline.—Section by the Cumbre, or Uspallata Pass.—Porphyries.—Gypseous\r\nstrata.—Section near the Puente del Inca; fossils of.—Great\r\nsubsidence.—Intrusive porphyries.—Plain of Uspallata.—Section of the\r\nUspallata chain.—Structure and nature of the strata.—Silicified\r\nvertical trees.—Great subsidence.—Granitic rocks of axis.—Concluding\r\nremarks on the Uspallata range; origin subsequent to that of the main\r\nCordillera; two periods of subsidence; comparison with the Portillo\r\nchain.—\r\n\r\n\r\nThe district between the Cordillera and the Pacific, on a rude average,\r\nis from about eighty to one hundred miles in width. It is crossed by\r\nmany chains of mountains, of which the principal ones, in the latitude\r\nof Valparaiso and southward of it, range nearly north and south; but in\r\nthe more northern parts of the province, they run in almost every\r\npossible direction. Near the Pacific, the mountain-ranges are generally\r\nformed of syenite or granite, and or of an allied euritic porphyry; in\r\nthe low country, besides these granitic rocks and greenstone, and much\r\ngneiss, there are, especially northward of Valparaiso, some\r\nconsiderable districts of true clay-slate with quartz veins, passing\r\ninto a feldspathic and porphyritic slate; there is also some grauwacke\r\nand quartzose and jaspery rocks, the latter occasionally assuming the\r\ncharacter of the basis of claystone porphyry: trap-dikes are numerous.\r\nNearer the Cordillera the ranges (such as those of S. Fernando, the\r\nPrado (Meyen “Reise um Erde” th. 1 s. 235.), and Aconcagua) are formed\r\npartly of granitic rocks, and partly of purple porphyritic\r\nconglomerates, claystone porphyry, greenstone porphyry, and other\r\nrocks, such as we shall immediately see, form the basal strata of the\r\nmain Cordillera. In the more northern parts of Chile, this porphyritic\r\nseries extends over large tracts of country far from the Cordillera;\r\nand even in Central Chile such occasionally occur in outlying\r\npositions.\r\n\r\nI will describe the Campana of Quillota, which stands only fifteen\r\nmiles from the Pacific, as an instance of one of these outlying masses.\r\nThis hill is conspicuous from rising to the height of 6,400 feet: its\r\nsummit shows a nucleus, uncovered for a height of 800 feet, of fine\r\ngreenstone, including epidote and octahedral magnetic iron ore; its\r\nflanks are formed of great strata of porphyritic claystone conglomerate\r\nassociated with various true porphyries and amygdaloids, alternating\r\nwith thick masses of a highly feldspathic, sometimes porphyritic,\r\npale-coloured slaty rock, with its cleavage-laminae dipping inwards at\r\na high angle. At the base of the hill there are syenites, a granular\r\nmixture of quartz and feldspar, and harsh quartzose rocks, all\r\nbelonging to the basal metamorphic series. I may observe that at the\r\nfoot of several hills of this class, where the porphyries are first\r\nseen (as near S. Fernando, the Prado, Las Vacas, etc.), similar harsh\r\nquartzose rocks and granular mixtures of quartz and feldspar occur, as\r\nif the more fusible constituent parts of the granitic series had been\r\ndrawn off to form the overlying porphyries.\r\n\r\nIn Central Chile, the flanks of the main Cordillera, into which I\r\npenetrated by four different valleys, generally consist of distinctly\r\nstratified rocks. The strata are inclined at angles varying from\r\nsometimes even under ten, to twenty degrees, very rarely exceeding\r\nforty degrees: in some, however, of the quite small, exterior,\r\nspur-like ridges, the inclination was not unfrequently greater. The dip\r\nof the strata in the main outer lines was usually outwards or from the\r\nCordillera, but in Northern Chile frequently inwards,—that is, their\r\nbasset-edges fronted the Pacific. Dikes occur in extraordinary numbers.\r\nIn the great, central, loftiest ridges, the strata, as we shall\r\npresently see, are almost always highly inclined and often vertical.\r\nBefore giving a detailed account of my two sections across the\r\nCordillera, it will, I think, be convenient to describe the basal\r\nstrata as seen, often to a thickness of four or five thousand feet, on\r\nthe flanks of the outer lines.\r\n\r\nBASAL STRATA OF THE CORDILLERA.\r\n\r\nThe prevailing rock is a purplish or greenish, porphyritic claystone\r\nconglomerate. The embedded fragments vary in size from mere particles\r\nto blocks as much as six or eight inches (rarely more) in diameter; in\r\nmany places, where the fragments were minute, the signs of aqueous\r\ndeposition were unequivocally distinct; where they were large, such\r\nevidence could rarely be detected. The basis is generally porphyritic\r\nwith perfect crystals of feldspar, and resembles that of a true\r\ninjected claystone porphyry: often, however, it has a mechanical or\r\nsedimentary aspect, and sometimes (as at Jajuel) is jaspery. The\r\nincluded fragments are either angular, or partially or quite rounded\r\n(Some of the rounded fragments in the porphyritic conglomerate near the\r\nBaths of Cauquenes, were marked with radii and concentric zones of\r\ndifferent shades of colour: any one who did not know that pebbles, for\r\ninstance flint pebbles from the chalk, are sometimes zoned\r\nconcentrically with their worn and rounded surfaces, might have been\r\nled to infer, that these balls of porphyry were not true pebbles, but\r\nhad originated in concretionary action.); in some parts the rounded, in\r\nothers the angular fragments prevail, and usually both kinds are mixed\r\ntogether: hence the word BRECCIA ought strictly to be appended to the\r\nterm PORPHYRITIC CONGLOMERATE. The fragments consist of many varieties\r\nof claystone porphyry, usually of nearly the same colour with the\r\nsurrounding basis, namely, purplish-reddish, brownish, mottled or\r\nbright green; occasionally fragments of a laminated, pale-coloured,\r\nfeldspathic rock, like altered clay-slate are included; as are\r\nsometimes grains of quartz, but only in one instance in Central Chile\r\n(namely, at the mines of Jajuel) a few pebbles of quartz. I nowhere\r\nobserved mica in this formation, and rarely hornblende; where the\r\nlatter mineral did occur, I was generally in doubt whether the mass\r\nreally belonged to this formation, or was of intrusive origin.\r\nCalcareous spar occasionally occurs in small cavities; and nests and\r\nlayers of epidote are common. In some few places in the finer-grained\r\nvarieties (for instance, at Quillota), there were short, interrupted\r\nlayers of earthy feldspar, which could be traced, exactly as at Port\r\nDesire, passing into large crystals of feldspar: I doubt, however,\r\nwhether in this instance the layers had ever been separately deposited\r\nas tufaceous sediment.\r\n\r\nAll the varieties of porphyritic conglomerates and breccias pass into\r\neach other, and by innumerable gradations into porphyries no longer\r\nretaining the least trace of mechanical origin: the transition appears\r\nto have been effected much more easily in the finer-grained, than in\r\nthe coarser-grained varieties. In one instance, near Cauquenes, I\r\nnoticed that a porphyritic conglomerate assumed a spheroidal structure,\r\nand tended to become columnar. Besides the porphyritic conglomerates\r\nand the perfectly characterised porphyries, of metamorphic origin,\r\nthere are other porphyries, which, though differing not at all or only\r\nslightly in composition, certainly have had a different origin: these\r\nconsist of pink or purple claystone porphyries, sometimes including\r\ngrains of quartz,—of greenstone porphyry, and of other dusky rocks, all\r\ngenerally porphyritic with fine, large, tabular, opaque crystals, often\r\nplaced crosswise, of feldspar cleaving like albite (judging from\r\nseveral measurements), and often amygdaloidal with silex, agate,\r\ncarbonate of lime, green and brown bole. (This bole is a very common\r\nmineral in the amygdaloidal rocks; it is generally of a greenish- brown\r\ncolour, with a radiating structure; externally it is black with an\r\nalmost metallic lustre, but often coated by a bright green film. It is\r\nsoft and can be scratched by a quill; under the blowpipe swells greatly\r\nand becomes scaly, then fuses easily into a black magnetic bead. This\r\nsubstance is evidently similar to that which often occurs in submarine\r\nvolcanic rocks. An examination of some very curious specimens of a fine\r\nporphyry (from Jajuel) leads me to suspect that some of these\r\namygdaloidal balls, instead of having been deposited in pre-existing\r\nair-vesicles, are of concretionary origin; for in these specimens, some\r\nof the pea-shaped little masses (often externally marked with minute\r\npits) are formed of a mixture of green earth with stony matter, like\r\nthe basis of the porphyry, including minute imperfect crystals of\r\nfeldspar; and these pea-shaped little masses are themselves\r\namygdaloidal with minute spheres of the green earth, each enveloped by\r\na film of white, apparently feldspathic, earthy matter: so that the\r\nporphyry is doubly amygdaloidal. It should not, however, be overlooked,\r\nthat all the strata here have undergone metamorphic action, which may\r\nhave caused crystals of feldspar to appear, and other changes to be\r\neffected, in the originally simple amygdaloidal balls. Mr. J.D. Dana,\r\nin an excellent paper on Trap-rocks “Edinburgh New Philosophical\r\nJournal” volume 41 page 198, has argued with great force, that all\r\namygdaloidal minerals have been deposited by aqueous infiltration. I\r\nmay take this opportunity of alluding to a curious case, described in\r\nmy work on “Volcanic Islands,” of an amygdaloid with many of its cells\r\nonly half filled up with a mesotypic mineral. M. Rose has described an\r\namygdaloid, brought by Dr. Meyen “Reise um Erde” Th. 1. s. 316, from\r\nChile, as consisting of crystallised quartz, with crystals of stilbite\r\nwithin, and lined externally by green earth.) These several porphyritic\r\nand amygdaloidal varieties never show any signs of passing into masses\r\nof sedimentary origin: they occur both in great and small intrusive\r\nmasses, and likewise in strata alternating with those of the\r\nporphyritic conglomerate, and with the planes of junction often quite\r\ndistinct, yet not seldom blended together. In some of these intrusive\r\nmasses, the porphyries exhibit, more or less plainly, a brecciated\r\nstructure, like that often seen in volcanic masses. These brecciated\r\nporphyries could generally be distinguished at once from the\r\nmetamorphosed, porphyritic breccia- conglomerates, by all the fragments\r\nbeing angular and being formed of the same variety, and by the absence\r\nof every trace of aqueous deposition. One of the porphyries above\r\nspecified, namely, the greenstone porphyry with large tabular crystals\r\nof albite, is particularly abundant, and in some parts of the\r\nCordillera (as near St. Jago) seemed more common even than the purplish\r\nporphyritic conglomerate. Numerous dikes likewise consist of this\r\ngreenstone porphyry; others are formed of various fine-grained trappean\r\nrocks; but very few of claystone porphyry: I saw no true basaltic\r\ndikes.\r\n\r\nIn several places in the lower part of the series, but not everywhere,\r\nthick masses of a highly feldspathic, often porphyritic, slaty rock\r\noccur interstratified with the porphyritic conglomerate; I believe in\r\none or two cases blackish limestone has been found in a similar\r\nposition. The feldspathic rock is of a pale grey or greenish colour; it\r\nis easily fusible; where porphyritic, the crystals of feldspar are\r\ngenerally small and vitreous: it is distinctly laminated, and sometimes\r\nincludes parallel layers of epidote (This mineral is extremely common\r\nin all the formations of Chile; in the gneiss near Valparaiso and in\r\nthe granitic veins crossing it, in the injected greenstone crowning the\r\nC. of Quillota, in some granitic porphyries, in the porphyritic\r\nconglomerate, and in the feldspathic clay-slates.); the lamination\r\nappears to be distinct from stratification. Occasionally this rock is\r\nsomewhat curious; and at one spot, namely, at the C. of Quillota, it\r\nhad a brecciated structure. Near the mines of Jajuel, in a thick\r\nstratum of this feldspathic, porphyritic slate, there was a layer of\r\nhard, blackish, siliceous, infusible, compact clay-slate, such as I saw\r\nnowhere else; at the same place I was able to follow for a considerable\r\ndistance the junction between the slate and the conformably underlying\r\nporphyritic conglomerate, and they certainly passed gradually into each\r\nother. Wherever these slaty feldspathic rocks abound, greenstone seems\r\ncommon; at the C. of Quillota a bed of well-crystallised greenstone lay\r\nconformably in the midst of the feldspathic slate, with the upper and\r\nlower junctions passing insensibly into it. From this point, and from\r\nthe frequently porphyritic condition of the slate, I should perhaps\r\nhave considered this rock as an erupted one (like certain laminated\r\nfeldspathic lavas in the trachytic series), had I not seen in Tierra\r\ndel Fuego how readily true clay-slate becomes feldspathic and\r\nporphyritic, and had I not seen at Jajuel the included layer of black,\r\nsiliceous clay-slate, which no one could have thought of igneous\r\norigin. The gentle passage of the feldspathic slate, at Jajuel, into\r\nthe porphyritic conglomerate, which is certainly of aqueous origin,\r\nshould also be taken in account.\r\n\r\nThe alternating strata of porphyries and porphyritic conglomerate, and\r\nwith the occasionally included beds of feldspathic slate, together make\r\na grand formation; in several places within the Cordillera, I estimated\r\nits thickness at from six to seven thousand feet. It extends for many\r\nhundred miles, forming the western flank of the Chilean Cordillera; and\r\neven at Iquique in Peru, 850 miles north of the southernmost point\r\nexamined by me in Chile, the coast-escarpment which rises to a height\r\nof between two and three thousand feet is thus composed. In several\r\nparts of Northern Chile this formation extends much further towards the\r\nPacific, over the granitic and metamorphic lower rocks, than it does in\r\nCentral Chile; but the main Cordillera may be considered as its central\r\nline, and its breadth in an east and west direction is never great. At\r\nfirst the origin of this thick, massive, long but narrow formation,\r\nappeared to me very anomalous: whence were derived, and how were\r\ndispersed the innumerable fragments, often of large size, sometimes\r\nangular and sometimes rounded, and almost invariably composed of\r\nporphyritic rocks? Seeing that the interstratified porphyries are never\r\nvesicular and often not even amygdaloidal, we must conclude that the\r\npile was formed in deep water; how then came so many fragments to be\r\nwell rounded and so many to remain angular, sometimes the two kinds\r\nbeing equally mingled, sometimes one and sometimes the other\r\npreponderating? That the claystone, greenstone, and other porphyries\r\nand amygdaloids, which lie CONFORMABLY between the beds of\r\nconglomerate, are ancient submarine lavas, I think there can be no\r\ndoubt; and I believe we must look to the craters whence these streams\r\nwere erupted, as the source of the breccia- conglomerate; after the\r\ngreat explosion, we may fairly imagine that the water in the heated and\r\nscarcely quiescent crater would remain for a considerable time\r\nsufficiently agitated to triturate and round the loose fragments, few\r\nor many in number, would be shot forth at the next eruption, associated\r\nwith few or many angular fragments, according to the strength of the\r\nexplosion. (This certainly seems to have taken place in some recent\r\nvolcanic archipelagos, as at the Galapagos, where numerous craters are\r\nexclusively formed of tuff and fragments of lava.) The porphyritic\r\nconglomerate being purple or reddish, even when alternating with dusty-\r\ncoloured or bright green porphyries and amygdaloids, is probably an\r\nanalogous circumstance to the scoriae of the blackish basalts being\r\noften bright red. The ancient submarine orifices whence the porphyries\r\nand their fragments were ejected having been arranged in a band, like\r\nmost still active volcanoes, accounts for the thickness, the\r\nnarrowness, and linear extension of this formation.\r\n\r\nThis whole great pile of rock has suffered much metamorphic action, as\r\nis very obvious in the gradual formation and appearance of the crystals\r\nof albitic feldspar and of epidote—in the bending together of the\r\nfragments— in the appearance of a laminated structure in the\r\nfeldspathic slate—and, lastly, in the disappearance of the planes of\r\nstratification, which could sometimes be seen on the same mountain\r\nquite distinct in the upper part, less and less plain on the flanks,\r\nand quite obliterated at the base. Partly owing to this metamorphic\r\naction, and partly to the close relationship in origin, I have seen\r\nfragments of porphyries—taken from a metamorphosed conglomerate—from a\r\nneighbouring stream of lava—from the nucleus or centre (as it appeared\r\nto me) of the whole submarine volcano— and lastly from an intrusive\r\nmass of quite subsequent origin, all of which were absolutely\r\nundistinguishable in external characters.\r\n\r\nOne other rock, of plutonic origin, and highly important in the history\r\nof the Cordillera, from having been injected in most of the great axes\r\nof elevation, and from having apparently been instrumental in\r\nmetamorphosing the superincumbent strata, may be conveniently described\r\nin this preliminary discussion. It has been called by some authors\r\nANDESITE: it mainly consists of well-crystallised white albite (as\r\ndetermined with the goniometer in numerous specimens both by Professor\r\nMiller and myself), of less perfectly crystallised green hornblende,\r\noften associated with much mica, with chlorite and epidote, and\r\noccasionally with a few grains of quartz: in one instance in Northern\r\nChile, I found crystals of orthitic or potash feldspar, mingled with\r\nthose of albite. (I here, and elsewhere, call by this name, those\r\nfeldspathic minerals which cleave like albite: but it now appears\r\n(“Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal” volume 24 page 181) that Abich\r\nhas analysed a mineral from the Cordillera, associated with hornblende\r\nand quartz (probably the same rock with that here under discussion),\r\nwhich cleaves like albite, but which is a new and distinct kind, called\r\nby him ANDESINE. It is allied to leucite, with the greater proportion\r\nof its potash replaced by lime and soda. This mineral seems scarcely\r\ndistinguishable from albite, except by analysis.) Where the mica and\r\nquartz are abundant, the rock cannot be distinguished from granite; and\r\nit may be called andesitic granite. Where these two minerals are quite\r\nabsent, and when, as often then happens, the crystals of albite are\r\nimperfect and blend together, the rock may be called andesitic\r\nporphyry, which bears nearly the same relation to andesitic granite\r\nthat euritic porphyry does to common granite. These andesitic rocks\r\nform mountain masses of a white colour, which, in their general outline\r\nand appearance—in their joints—in their occasionally including\r\ndark-coloured, angular fragments, apparently of some pre-existing\r\nrock—and in the great dikes branching from them into the superincumbent\r\nstrata, manifest a close and striking resemblance to masses of common\r\ngranite and syenite: I never, however, saw in these andesitic rocks,\r\nthose granitic veins of segregation which are so common in true\r\ngranites. We have seen that andesite occurs in three places in Tierra\r\ndel Fuego; in Chile, from S. Fernando to Copiapo, a distance of 450\r\nmiles, I found it under most of the axes of elevation; in a collection\r\nof specimens from the Cordillera of Lima in Peru, I immediately\r\nrecognised it; and Erman states that it occurs in Eastern Kamtschatka.\r\n(“Geographical Journal” volume 9 page 510.) From its wide range, and\r\nfrom the important part it has played in the history of the Cordillera,\r\nI think this rock has well deserved its distinct name of Andesite.\r\n\r\nThe few still active volcanoes in Chile are confined to the central and\r\nloftiest ranges of the Cordillera; and volcanic matter, such as appears\r\nto have been of subaerial eruption, is everywhere rare. According to\r\nMeyen, there is a hill of pumice high up the valley of the Maypu, and\r\nlikewise a trachytic formation at Colina, a village situated north of\r\nSt. Jago. (“Reise um Erde” Th. 1 ss. 338 and 362.) Close to this latter\r\ncity, there are two hills formed of a pale feldspathic porphyry,\r\nremarkable from being doubly columnar, great cylindrical columns being\r\nsubdivided into smaller four- or five-sided ones; and a third hillock\r\n(Cerro Blanco) is formed of a fragmentary mass of rock, which I\r\nbelieved to be of volcanic origin, intermediate in character between\r\nthe above feldspathic porphyry and common trachyte, and containing\r\nneedles of hornblende and granular oxide of iron. Near the Baths of\r\nCauquenes, between two short parallel lines of elevation, where they\r\nare intersected by the valley, there is a small, though distinct\r\nvolcanic district; the rock is a dark grey (andesitic) trachyte, which\r\nfuses into a greenish-grey bead, and is formed of long crystals of\r\nfractured glassy albite (judging from one measurement) mingled with\r\nwell- formed crystals, often twin, of augite. The whole mass is\r\nvesicular, but the surface is darker coloured and much more vesicular\r\nthan any other part. This trachyte forms a cliff-bounded, horizontal,\r\nnarrow strip on the steep southern side of the valley, at the height of\r\nfour or five hundred feet above the river-bed; judging from an\r\napparently corresponding line of cliff on the northern side, the valley\r\nmust once have been filled up to this height by a field of lava. On the\r\nsummit of a lofty mountain some leagues higher up this same valley of\r\nthe Cachapual, I found columnar pitchstone porphyritic with feldspar; I\r\ndo not suppose this rock to be of volcanic origin, and only mention it\r\nhere, from its being intersected by masses and dikes of a VESICULAR\r\nrock, approaching in character to trachyte; in no other part of Chile\r\ndid I observe vesicular or amygdaloidal dikes, though these are so\r\ncommon in ordinary volcanic districts.\r\n\r\nPASSAGE OF THE ANDES BY THE PORTILLO OR PEQUENES PASS.\r\n\r\nAlthough I crossed the Cordillera only once by this pass, and only once\r\nby that of the Cumbre or Uspallata (presently to be described), riding\r\nslowly and halting occasionally to ascend the mountains, there are many\r\ncircumstances favourable to obtaining a more faithful sketch of their\r\nstructure than would at first be thought possible from so short an\r\nexamination. The mountains are steep and absolutely bare of vegetation;\r\nthe atmosphere is resplendently clear; the stratification distinct; and\r\nthe rocks brightly and variously coloured: some of the natural sections\r\nmight be truly compared for distinctness to those coloured ones in\r\ngeological works. Considering how little is known of the structure of\r\nthis gigantic range, to which I particularly attended, most travellers\r\nhaving collected only specimens of the rocks, I think my\r\nsketch-sections, though necessarily imperfect, possess some interest.\r\nSection 1/1 in Plate 1 which I will now describe in detail, is on a\r\nhorizontal scale of a third of an inch to a nautical mile, and on a\r\nvertical scale of one inch to a mile (or 6,000 feet). The width of the\r\nrange (excluding a few outlying hillocks), from the plain on which St.\r\nJago the capital of Chile stands, to the Pampas, is sixty miles, as far\r\nas I can judge from the maps, which differ from each other and are all\r\nEXCEEDINGLY imperfect. The St. Jago plain at the mouth of the Maypu, I\r\nestimate from adjoining known points at 2,300 feet, and the Pampas at\r\n3,500 feet, both above the level of the sea. The height of the Pequenes\r\nline, according to Dr. Gillies, is 13,210 feet (“Journal of Natural and\r\nGeographical Science” August 1830.); and that of the Portillo line\r\n(both in the gaps where the road crosses them) is 14,345 feet; the\r\nlowest part of the intermediate valley of Tenuyan is 7,530 feet—all\r\nabove the level of the sea.\r\n\r\nThe Cordillera here, and indeed I believe throughout Chile, consist of\r\nseveral parallel, anticlinal and uniclinal mountain-lines, ranging\r\nnorth, or north with a little westing, and south. Some exterior and\r\nmuch lower ridges often vary considerably from this course, projecting\r\nlike oblique spurs from the main ranges: in the district towards the\r\nPacific, the mountains, as before remarked, extend in various\r\ndirections, even east and west. In the main exterior lines, the strata,\r\nas also before remarked, are seldom inclined at a high angle; but in\r\nthe central lofty ridges they are almost always highly inclined, broken\r\nby many great faults, and often vertical. As far as I could judge, few\r\nof the ranges are of great length: and in the central parts of the\r\nCordillera, I was frequently able to follow with my eye a ridge\r\ngradually becoming higher and higher, as the stratification increased\r\nin inclination, from one end where its height was trifling and its\r\nstrata gently inclined to the other end where vertical strata formed\r\nsnow-clad pinnacles. Even outside the main Cordillera, near the baths\r\nof Cauquenes, I observed one such case, where a north and south ridge\r\nhad its strata in the valley inclined at 37 degrees, and less than a\r\nmile south of it at 67 degrees: another parallel and similarly inclined\r\nridge rose at the distance of about five miles, into a lofty mountain\r\nwith absolutely vertical strata. Within the Cordillera, the height of\r\nthe ridges and the inclination of the strata often became doubled and\r\ntrebled in much shorter distances than five miles; this peculiar form\r\nof upheaval probably indicates that the stratified crust was thin, and\r\nhence yielded to the underlying intrusive masses unequally, at certain\r\npoints on the lines of fissure.\r\n\r\nThe valleys, by which the Cordillera are drained, follow the anticlinal\r\nor rarely synclinal troughs, which deviate most from the usual north\r\nand south course; or still more commonly those lines of faults or of\r\nunequal curvature (that is, lines with the strata on both hands dipping\r\nin the same direction, but at a somewhat different angle) which deviate\r\nmost from a northerly course. Occasionally the torrents run for some\r\ndistance in the north and south valleys, and then recover their eastern\r\nor western course by bursting through the ranges at those points where\r\nthe strata have been least inclined and the height consequently is\r\nless. Hence the valleys, along which the roads run, are generally\r\nzigzag; and, in drawing an east and west section, it is necessary to\r\ncontract greatly that which is actually seen on the road.\r\n\r\nCommencing at the western end of Section 1/1 where the R. Maypu\r\ndebouches on the plain of St. Jago, we immediately enter on the\r\nporphyritic conglomerate formation, and in the midst of it find some\r\nhummocks [A] of granite and syenite, which probably (for I neglected to\r\ncollect specimens) belong to the andesitic class. These are succeeded\r\nby some rugged hills [B] of dark-green, crystalline, feldspathic and in\r\nsome parts slaty rocks, which I believe belong to the altered\r\nclay-slate formation. From this point, great mountains of purplish and\r\ngreenish, generally thinly stratified, highly porphyritic\r\nconglomerates, including many strata of amygdaloidal and greenstone\r\nporphyries, extend up the valley to the junction of the rivers Yeso and\r\nVolcan. As the valley here runs in a very southerly course, the width\r\nof the porphyritic conglomerate formation is quite conjectural; and\r\nfrom the same cause, I was unable to make out much about the\r\nstratification. In most of the exterior mountains the dip was gentle\r\nand directed inwards; and at only one spot I observed an inclination as\r\nhigh as 50 degrees. Near the junction of the R. Colorado with the main\r\nstream, there is a hill of whitish, brecciated, partially decomposed\r\nfeldspathic porphyry, having a volcanic aspect but not being really of\r\nthat nature: at Tolla, however, in this valley, Dr. Meyen met with a\r\nhill of pumice containing mica. (“Reise um Erde” Th.1 ss. 338, 341.) At\r\nthe junction of the Yeso and Volcan [D] there is an extensive mass, in\r\nwhite conical hillocks, of andesite, containing some mica, and passing\r\neither into andesitic granite, or into a spotted, semi-granular mixture\r\nof albitic (?) feldspar and hornblende: in the midst of this formation\r\nDr. Meyen found true trachyte. The andesite is covered by strata of\r\ndark-coloured, crystalline, obscurely porphyritic rocks, and above them\r\nby the ordinary porphyritic conglomerates,—the strata all dipping away\r\nat a small angle from the underlying mass. The surrounding lofty\r\nmountains appear to be entirely composed of the porphyritic\r\nconglomerate, and I estimated its thickness here at between six and\r\nseven thousand feet. Beyond the junction of the Yeso and Volcan, the\r\nporphyritic strata appear to dip towards the hillocks of andesite at an\r\nangle of 40 degrees; but at some distant points on the same ridge they\r\nare bent up and vertical. Following the valley of the Yeso, trending\r\nN.E. (and therefore still unfavourable for our transverse section), the\r\nsame porphyritic conglomerate formation is prolonged to near the\r\nCuestadel Indio, situated at the western end of the basin (like a\r\ndrained lake) of Yeso. Some way before arriving at this point, distant\r\nlofty pinnacles capped by coloured strata belonging to the great\r\ngypseous formation could first be seen. From the summit of the Cuesta,\r\nlooking southward, there is a magnificent sectional view of a\r\nmountain-mass, at least 2,000 feet in thickness [E], of fine andesite\r\ngranite (containing much black mica, a little chlorite and quartz),\r\nwhich sends great white dikes far into the superincumbent,\r\ndark-coloured, porphyritic conglomerates. At the line of junction the\r\ntwo formations are wonderfully interlaced together: in the lower part\r\nof the porphyritic conglomerate, the stratification has been quite\r\nobliterated, whilst in the upper part it is very distinct, the beds\r\ncomposing the crests of the surrounding mountains being inclined at\r\nangles of between 70 and 80 degrees, and some being even vertical. On\r\nthe northern side of the valley, there is a great corresponding mass of\r\nandesitic granite, which is encased by porphyritic conglomerate,\r\ndipping both on the western and eastern sides, at about 80 degrees to\r\nwest, but on the eastern side with the tips of the strata bent in such\r\na manner, as to render it probable that the whole mass has been on that\r\nside thrown over and inverted.\r\n\r\nIn the valley basin of the Yeso, which I estimated at 7,000 feet above\r\nthe level of the sea, we first reach at [F] the gypseous formation. Its\r\nthickness is very great. It consists in most parts of snow-white, hard,\r\ncompact gypsum, which breaks with a saccharine fracture, having\r\ntranslucent edges; under the blowpipe gives out much vapour; it\r\nfrequently includes nests and exceedingly thin layers of crystallised,\r\nblackish carbonate of lime. Large, irregularly shaped concretions\r\n(externally still exhibiting lines of aqueous deposition) of\r\nblackish-grey, but sometimes white, coarsely and brilliantly\r\ncrystallised, hard anhydrite, abound within the common gypsum.\r\nHillocks, formed of the hardest and purest varieties of the white\r\ngypsum, stand up above the surrounding parts, and have their surfaces\r\ncracked and marked, just like newly baked bread. There is much pale\r\nbrown, soft argillaceous gypsum; and there were some intercalated green\r\nbeds which I had not time to reach. I saw only one fragment of selenite\r\nor transparent gypsum, and that perhaps may have come from some\r\nsubsequently formed vein. From the mineralogical characters here given,\r\nit is probable that these gypseous beds have undergone some metamorphic\r\naction. The strata are much hidden by detritus, but they appeared in\r\nmost parts to be highly inclined; and in an adjoining lofty pinnacle\r\nthey could be distinctly seen bending up, and becoming vertical,\r\nconformably with the underlying porphyritic conglomerate. In very many\r\nparts of the great mountain-face [F], composed of thin gypseous beds,\r\nthere were innumerable masses, irregularly shaped and not like dikes,\r\nyet with well-defined edges, of an imperfectly granular, pale greenish,\r\nor yellowish-white rock, essentially composed of feldspar, with a\r\nlittle chlorite or hornblende, epidote, iron-pyrites, and ferruginous\r\npowder: I believe that these curious trappean masses have been injected\r\nfrom the not far distant mountain-mass [E] of andesite whilst still\r\nfluid, and that owing to the softness of the gypseous strata they have\r\nnot acquired the ordinary forms of dikes. Subsequently to the injection\r\nof these feldspathic rocks, a great dislocation has taken place; and\r\nthe much shattered gypseous strata here overlie a hillock [G], composed\r\nof vertical strata of impure limestone and of black highly calcareous\r\nshale including threads of gypsum: these rocks, as we shall presently\r\nsee, belong to the upper parts of the gypseous series, and hence must\r\nhere have been thrown down by a vast fault.\r\n\r\nProceeding up the valley-basin of the Yeso, and taking our section\r\nsometimes on one hand and sometimes on the other, we come to a great\r\nhill of stratified porphyritic conglomerate [H] dipping at 45 degrees\r\nto the west; and a few hundred yards farther on, we have a bed between\r\nthree or four hundred feet thick of gypsum [I] dipping eastward at a\r\nvery high angle: here then we have a fault and anticlinal axis. On the\r\nopposite side of the valley, a vertical mass of red conglomerate,\r\nconformably underlying the gypsum, appears gradually to lose its\r\nstratification and passes into a mountain of porphyry. The gypsum [I]\r\nis covered by a bed [K], at least 1,000 feet in thickness, of a\r\npurplish-red, compact, heavy, fine-grained sandstone or mudstone, which\r\nfuses easily into a white enamel, and is seen under a lens to contain\r\ntriturated crystals. This is succeeded by a bed [L], 1,000 feet thick\r\n(I believe I understate the thickness) of gypsum, exactly like the beds\r\nbefore described; and this again is capped by another great bed [M] of\r\npurplish-red sandstone. All these strata dip eastward; but the\r\ninclination becomes less and less, as we leave the first and almost\r\nvertical bed [I] of gypsum.\r\n\r\nLeaving the basin-plain of Yeso, the road rapidly ascends, passing by\r\nmountains composed of the gypseous and associated beds, with their\r\nstratification greatly disturbed and therefore not easily intelligible:\r\nhence this part of the section has been left uncoloured. Shortly before\r\nreaching the great Pequenes ridge, the lowest stratum visible [N] is a\r\nred sandstone or mudstone, capped by a vast thickness of black,\r\ncompact, calcareous, shaly rock [O], which has been thrown into four\r\nlofty, though small ridges: looking northward, the strata in these\r\nridges are seen gradually to rise in inclination, becoming in some\r\ndistant pinnacles absolutely vertical.\r\n\r\nThe ridge of Pequenes, which divides the waters flowing into the\r\nPacific and Atlantic Oceans, extends in a nearly N.N.W. and S.S.E.\r\nline; its strata dip eastward at an angle of between 30 and 45 degrees,\r\nbut in the higher peaks bending up and becoming almost vertical. Where\r\nthe road crosses this range, the height is 13,210 feet above the\r\nsea-level, and I estimated the neighbouring pinnacles at from fourteen\r\nto fifteen thousand feet. The lowest stratum visible in this ridge is a\r\nred stratified sandstone [P]; on it are superimposed two great masses\r\n[Q and S] of black, hard, compact, even having a conchoidal fracture,\r\ncalcareous, more or less laminated shale, passing into limestone: this\r\nrock contains organic remains, presently to be enumerated. The\r\ncompacter varieties fuse easily in a white glass; and this I may add is\r\na very general character with all the sedimentary beds in the\r\nCordillera: although this rock when broken is generally quite black, it\r\neverywhere weathers into an ash-grey tint. Between these two great\r\nmasses [Q and S], a bed [R] of gypsum is interposed, about three\r\nhundred feet in thickness, and having the same characters as heretofore\r\ndescribed. I estimated the total thickness of these three beds [Q, R,\r\nS] at nearly three thousand feet; and to this must be added, as will be\r\nimmediately seen, a great overlying mass of red sandstone.\r\n\r\nIn descending the eastern slope of this great central range, the\r\nstrata, which in the upper part dip eastward at about an angle of 40\r\ndegrees, become more and more curved, till they are nearly vertical;\r\nand a little further onwards there is seen on the further side of a\r\nravine, a thick mass of strata of bright red sandstone [T], with their\r\nupper extremities slightly curved, showing that they were once\r\nconformably prolonged over the beds [S]: on the southern and opposite\r\nside of the road, this red sandstone and the underlying black shaly\r\nrocks stand vertical, and in actual juxtaposition. Continuing to\r\ndescend, we come to a synclinal valley filled with rubbish, beyond\r\nwhich we have the red sandstone [T2] corresponding with [T], and now\r\ndipping, as is seen both north and south of the road, at 45 degrees to\r\nthe west; and under it, the beds [S2, R2, Q2, and I believe P2] in\r\ncorresponding order and of similar composition, with those on the\r\nwestern flank of the Pequenes range, but dipping westward. Close to the\r\nsynclinal valley the dip of these strata is 45 degrees, but at the\r\neastern or farther end of the series it increases to 60 degrees. Here\r\nthe great gypseous formation abruptly terminates, and is succeeded\r\neastward by a pile of more modern strata. Considering how violently\r\nthese central ranges have been dislocated, and how very numerous dikes\r\nare in the exterior and lower parts of the Cordillera, it is remarkable\r\nthat I did not here notice a single dike. The prevailing rock in this\r\nneighbourhood is the black, calcareous, compact shale, whilst in the\r\nvalley-basin of the Yeso the purplish red sandstone or mudstone\r\npredominates,—both being associated with gypseous strata of exactly the\r\nsame nature. It would be very difficult to ascertain the relative\r\nsuperposition of these several masses, for we shall afterwards see in\r\nthe Cumbre Pass that the gypseous and intercalated beds are\r\nlens-shaped, and that they thin out, even where very thick, and\r\ndisappear in short horizontal distances: it is quite possible that the\r\nblack shales and red sandstones may be contemporaneous, but it is more\r\nprobable that the former compose the uppermost parts of the series.\r\n\r\nThe fossils above alluded to in the black calcareous shales are few in\r\nnumber, and are in an imperfect condition; they consist, as named for\r\nme by M. d’Orbigny, of:—\r\n\r\n1. Ammonite, indeterminable, near to A. recticostatus, d’Orbigny, “Pal.\r\nFranc.” (Neocomian formation). 2. Gryphaea, near to G. Couloni\r\n(Neocomian formations of France and Neufchatel). 3. Natica,\r\nindeterminable. 4. Cyprina rostrata, d’Orbigny, “Pal. Franc.”\r\n(Neocomian formation). 5. Rostellaria angulosa (?), d’Orbigny, “Pal. de\r\nl’Amer. Mer.” 6. Terebratula (?).\r\n\r\nSome of the fragments of Ammonites were as thick as a man’s arm: the\r\nGryphaea is much the most abundant shell. These fossils M. d’Orbigny\r\nconsiders as belonging to the Neocomian stage of the Cretaceous system.\r\nDr. Meyen, who ascended the valley of the Rio Volcan, a branch of the\r\nYeso, found a nearly similar, but apparently more calcareous formation,\r\nwith much gypsum, and no doubt the equivalent of that here described\r\n(“Reise um Erde” etc. Th. 1 s. 355.): the beds were vertical, and were\r\nprolonged up to the limits of perpetual snow; at the height of 9,000\r\nfeet above the sea, they abounded with fossils, consisting, according\r\nto Von Buch (“Descript. Phys. des Iles Canaries” page 471.), of:—\r\n\r\n1. Exogyra (Gryphaea) Couloni, absolutely identical with specimens from\r\nthe Jura and South of France. 2. Trigonia costata, identical with those\r\nfound in the upper Jurassic beds at Hildesheim. 3. Pecten striatus,\r\nidentical with those found in the upper Jurassic beds at Hildesheim. 4.\r\nCucullaea, corresponding in form to C. longirostris, so frequent in the\r\nupper Jurassic beds of Westphalia. 5. Ammonites resembling A. biplex.\r\n\r\nVon Buch concludes that this formation is intermediate between the\r\nlimestone of the Jura and the chalk, and that it is analogous with the\r\nuppermost Jurassic beds forming the plains of Switzerland. Hence M.\r\nD’Orbigny and Von Buch, under different terms, compare these fossils to\r\nthose from the same late stage in the secondary formations of Europe.\r\n\r\nSome of the fossils which I collected were found a good way down the\r\nwestern slope of the main ridge, and hence must originally have been\r\ncovered up by a great thickness of the black shaly rock, independently\r\nof the now denuded, thick, overlying masses of red sandstone. I\r\nneglected at the time to estimate how many hundred or rather thousand\r\nfeet thick the superincumbent strata must have been: and I will not now\r\nattempt to do so. This, however, would have been a highly interesting\r\npoint, as indicative of a great amount of subsidence, of which we shall\r\nhereafter find in other parts of the Cordillera analogous evidence\r\nduring this same period. The altitude of the Peuquenes Range,\r\nconsidering its not great antiquity, is very remarkable; many of the\r\nfossils were embedded at the height of 13,210 feet, and the same beds\r\nare prolonged up to at least from fourteen to fifteen thousand feet\r\nabove the level of the sea.\r\n\r\nTHE PORTILLO OR EASTERN CHAIN.\r\n\r\nThe valley of Tenuyan, separating the Peuquenes and Portillo lines, is,\r\nas estimated by Dr. Gillies and myself, about twenty miles in width;\r\nthe lowest part, where the road crosses the river, being 7,500 feet\r\nabove the sea-level. The pass on the Portillo line is 14,365 feet high\r\n(1,100 feet higher than that on the Peuquenes), and the neighbouring\r\npinnacles must, I conceive, rise to nearly 16,000 feet above the sea.\r\nThe river draining the intermediate valley of Tenuyan, passes through\r\nthe Portillo line. To return to our section:—shortly after leaving the\r\nlower beds [P2] of the gypseous formation, we come to grand masses of a\r\ncoarse, red conglomerate [V], totally unlike any strata hitherto seen\r\nin the Cordillera. This conglomerate is distinctly stratified, some of\r\nthe beds being well defined by the greater size of the pebbles: the\r\ncement is calcareous and sometimes crystalline, though the mass shows\r\nno signs of having been metamorphosed. The included pebbles are either\r\nperfectly or only partially rounded: they consist of purplish\r\nsandstones, of various porphyries, of brownish limestone, of black\r\ncalcareous, compact shale precisely like that in situ in the Peuquenes\r\nrange, and CONTAINING SOME OF THE SAME FOSSIL SHELLS; also very many\r\npebbles of quartz, some of micaceous schist, and numerous, broken,\r\nrounded crystals of a reddish orthitic or potash feldspar (as\r\ndetermined by Professor Miller), and these from their size must have\r\nbeen derived from a coarse-grained rock, probably granite. From this\r\nfeldspar being orthitic, and even from its external appearance, I\r\nventure positively to affirm that it has not been derived from the\r\nrocks of the western ranges; but, on the other hand, it may well have\r\ncome, together with the quartz and metamorphic schists, from the\r\neastern or Portillo line, for this line mainly consists of coarse\r\northitic granite. The pebbles of the fossiliferous slate and of the\r\npurple sandstone, certainly have been derived from the Peuquenes or\r\nwestern ranges.\r\n\r\nThe road crosses the valley of Tenuyan in a nearly east and west line,\r\nand for several miles we have on both hands the conglomerate,\r\neverywhere dipping west and forming separate great mountains. The\r\nstrata, where first met with, after leaving the gypseous formation, are\r\ninclined westward at an angle of only 20 degrees, which further on\r\nincreases to about 45 degrees. The gypseous strata, as we have seen,\r\nare also inclined westward: hence, when looking from the eastern side\r\nof the valley towards the Peuquenes range, a most deceptive appearance\r\nis presented, as if the newer beds of conglomerate dipped directly\r\nunder the much older beds of the gypseous formation. In the middle of\r\nthe valley, a bold mountain of unstratified lilac-coloured porphyry\r\n(with crystals of hornblende) projects; and further on, a little south\r\nof the road, there is another mountain, with its strata inclined at a\r\nsmall angle eastwards, which in its general aspect and colour,\r\nresembles the porphyritic conglomerate formation, so rare on this side\r\nof the Peuquenes line and so grandly developed throughout the western\r\nranges.\r\n\r\nThe conglomerate is of great thickness: I do not suppose that the\r\nstrata forming the separate mountain-masses [V,V,V] have ever been\r\nprolonged over each other, but that one mass has been broken up by\r\nseveral, distinct, parallel, uniclinal lines of elevation. Judging\r\ntherefore of the thickness of the conglomerate, as seen in the separate\r\nmountain-masses, I estimated it at least from one thousand five hundred\r\nto two thousand feet. The lower beds rest conformably on some\r\nsingularly coloured, soft strata [W], which I could not reach to\r\nexamine; and these again rest conformably on a thick mass of micaceous,\r\nthinly laminated, siliceous sandstone [X], associated with a little\r\nblack clay-slate. These lower beds are traversed by several dikes of\r\ndecomposing porphyry. The laminated sandstone is directly superimposed\r\non the vast masses of granite [Y,Y] which mainly compose the Portillo\r\nrange. The line of junction between this latter rock, which is of a\r\nbright red colour, and the whitish sandstone was beautifully distinct;\r\nthe sandstone being penetrated by numerous, great, tortuous dikes\r\nbranching from the granite, and having been converted into a granular\r\nquartz rock (singularly like that of the Falkland Islands), containing\r\nspecks of an ochrey powder, and black crystalline atoms, apparently of\r\nimperfect mica. The quartzose strata in one spot were folded into a\r\nregular dome.\r\n\r\nThe granite which composes the magnificent bare pinnacles and the steep\r\nwestern flank of the Portillo chain, is of a brick-red colour, coarsely\r\ncrystallised, and composed of orthitic or potash feldspar, quartz, and\r\nimperfect mica in small quantity, sometimes passing into chlorite.\r\nThese minerals occasionally assume a laminar or foliated arrangement.\r\nThe fact of the feldspar being orthitic in this range, is very\r\nremarkable, considering how rare, or rather, as I believe, entirely\r\nabsent, this mineral is throughout the western ranges, in which\r\nsoda-feldspar, or at least a variety cleaving like albite, is so\r\nextremely abundant. In one spot on the western flank, and on the\r\neastern flank near Los Manantiales and near the crest, I noticed some\r\ngreat masses of a whitish granite, parts of it fine- grained, and parts\r\ncontaining large crystals of feldspar; I neglected to collect\r\nspecimens, so I do not know whether this feldspar is also orthitic,\r\nthough I am inclined to think so from its general appearance. I saw\r\nalso some syenite and one mass which resembled andesite, but of which I\r\nlikewise neglected to collect specimens. From the manner in which the\r\nwhitish granites formed separate mountain-masses in the midst of the\r\nbrick-red variety, and from one such mass near the crest being\r\ntraversed by numerous veins of flesh-coloured and greenish eurite (into\r\nwhich I occasionally observed the brick-red granite insensibly\r\npassing), I conclude that the white granites probably belong to an\r\nolder formation, almost overwhelmed and penetrated by the red granite.\r\n\r\nOn the crest I saw also, at a short distance, some coloured stratified\r\nbeds, apparently like those [W] at the western base, but was prevented\r\nexamining them by a snowstorm: Mr. Caldcleugh, however, collected here\r\nspecimens of ribboned jasper, magnesian limestone, and other minerals.\r\n(“Travels” etc. volume 1 page 308.) A little way down the eastern slope\r\na few fragments of quartz and mica-slate are met with; but the great\r\nformation of this latter rock [Z], which covers up much of the eastern\r\nflank and base of the Portillo range, cannot be conveniently examined\r\nuntil much lower down at a place called Mal Paso. The mica-schist here\r\nconsists of thick layers of quartz, with intervening folia of\r\nfinely-scaly mica, often passing into a substance like black glossy\r\nclay-slate: in one spot, the layers of the quartz having disappeared,\r\nthe whole mass became converted into glossy clay-slate. Where the folia\r\nwere best defined, they were inclined at a high angle westward, that\r\nis, towards the range. The line of junction between the dark mica-slate\r\nand the coarse red granite was most clearly distinguishable from a vast\r\ndistance: the granite sent many small veins into the mica-slate, and\r\nincluded some angular fragments of it. As the sandstone on the western\r\nbase has been converted by the red granite into a granular quartz-rock,\r\nso this great formation of mica-schist may possibly have been\r\nmetamorphosed at the same time and by the same means; but I think it\r\nmore probable, considering its more perfect metamorphic character and\r\nits well-pronounced foliation, that it belongs to an anterior epoch,\r\nconnected with the white granites: I am the more inclined to this view,\r\nfrom having found at the foot of the range the mica-schist surrounding\r\na hummock [Y2], exclusively composed of white granite. Near Los\r\nArenales, the mountains on all sides are composed of the mica-slate;\r\nand looking backwards from this point up to the bare gigantic peaks\r\nabove, the view was eminently interesting. The colours of the red\r\ngranite and the black mica-slate are so distinct, that with a bright\r\nlight these rocks could be readily distinguished even from the Pampas,\r\nat a level of at least 9,000 feet below. The red granite, from being\r\ndivided by parallel joints, has weathered into sharp pinnacles, on some\r\nof which, even on some of the loftiest, little caps of mica-schist\r\ncould be clearly seen: here and there isolated patches of this rock\r\nadhered to the mountain-flanks, and these often corresponded in height\r\nand position on the opposite sides of the immense valleys. Lower down\r\nthe schist prevailed more and more, with only a few quite small points\r\nof granite projecting through. Looking at the entire eastern face of\r\nthe Portillo range, the red colour far exceeds in area the black; yet\r\nit was scarcely possible to doubt that the granite had once been almost\r\nwholly encased by the mica-schist.\r\n\r\nAt Los Arenales, low down on the eastern flank, the mica-slate is\r\ntraversed by several closely adjoining, broad dikes, parallel to each\r\nother and to the foliation of the schist. The dikes are formed of three\r\ndifferent varieties of rock, of which a pale brown feldspathic porphyry\r\nwith grains of quartz was much the most abundant. These dikes with\r\ntheir granules of quartz, as well as the mica-schist itself, strikingly\r\nresemble the rocks of the Chonos Archipelago. At a height of about\r\ntwelve hundred feet above the dikes, and perhaps connected with them,\r\nthere is a range of cliffs formed of successive lava-streams [AA],\r\nbetween three and four hundred feet in thickness, and in places finely\r\ncolumnar. The lava consists of dark- greyish, harsh rocks, intermediate\r\nin character between trachyte and basalt, containing glassy feldspar,\r\nolivine, and a little mica, and sometimes amygdaloidal with zeolite:\r\nthe basis is either quite compact, or crenulated with air-vesicles\r\narranged in laminae. The streams are separated from each other by beds\r\nof fragmentary brown scoriae, firmly cemented together, and including a\r\nfew well-rounded pebbles of lava. From their general appearance, I\r\nsuspect that these lava-streams flowed at an ancient period under the\r\npressure of the sea, when the Atlantic covered the Pampas and washed\r\nthe eastern foot of the Cordillera. (This conclusion might, perhaps,\r\neven have been anticipated, from the general rarity of volcanic action,\r\nexcept near the sea or large bodies of water. Conformably with this\r\nrule, at the present day, there are no active volcanoes on this eastern\r\nside of the Cordillera; nor are severe earthquakes experienced here.)\r\nOn the opposite and northern side of the valley there is another line\r\nof lava- cliffs at a corresponding height; the valley between being of\r\nconsiderable breadth, and as nearly as I could estimate 1,500 feet in\r\ndepth. This field of lava is confined on both sides by the mountains of\r\nmica-schist, and slopes down rapidly but irregularly to the edge of the\r\nPampas, where, having a thickness of about two hundred feet, it\r\nterminates against a little range of claystone porphyry. The valley in\r\nthis lower part expands into a bay-like, gentle slope, bordered by the\r\ncliffs of lava, which must certainly once have extended across this\r\nwide expanse. The inclination of the streams from Los Arenales to the\r\nmouth of the valley is so great, that at the time (though ignorant of\r\nM. Elie de Beaumont’s researches on the extremely small slope over\r\nwhich lava can flow, and yet retain a compact structure and\r\nconsiderable thickness) I concluded that they must subsequently to\r\ntheir flowing have been upheaved and tilted from the mountains; of this\r\nconclusion I can now entertain not the smallest doubt.\r\n\r\nAt the mouth of the valley, within the cliffs of the above lava-field,\r\nthere are remnants, in the form of separate small hillocks and of lines\r\nof low cliffs, of a considerable deposit of compact white tuff\r\n(quarried for filtering-stones), composed of broken pumice, volcanic\r\ncrystals, scales of mica, and fragments of lava. This mass has suffered\r\nmuch denudation; and the hard mica-schist has been deeply worn, since\r\nthe period of its deposition; and this period must have been subsequent\r\nto the denudation of the basaltic lava-streams, as attested by their\r\nencircling cliffs standing at a higher level. At the present day, under\r\nthe existing arid climate, ages might roll past without a square yard\r\nof rock of any kind being denuded, except perhaps in the rarely\r\nmoistened drainage-channel of the valley. Must we then look back to\r\nthat ancient period, when the waves of the sea beat against the eastern\r\nfoot of the Cordillera, for a power sufficient to denude extensively,\r\nthough superficially, this tufaceous deposit, soft although it be?\r\n\r\nThere remains only to mention some little water-worn hillocks [BB], a\r\nfew hundred feet in height, and mere mole-hills compared with the\r\ngigantic mountains behind them, which rise out of the sloping,\r\nshingle-covered margin of the Pampas. The first little range is\r\ncomposed of a brecciated purple porphyritic claystone, with obscurely\r\nmarked strata dipping at 70 degrees to the S.W.; the other ranges\r\nconsist of—a pale-coloured feldspathic porphyry,—a purple claystone\r\nporphyry with grains of quartz,— and a rock almost exclusively composed\r\nof brick-red crystals of feldspar. These outermost small lines of\r\nelevation extend in a N.W. by W. and S.E. by S. direction.\r\n\r\nCONCLUDING REMARKS ON THE PORTILLO RANGE.\r\n\r\nWhen on the Pampas and looking southward, and whilst travelling\r\nnorthward, I could see for very many leagues the red granite and dark\r\nmica-schist forming the crest and eastern flank of the Portillo line.\r\nThis great range, according to Dr. Gillies, can be traced with little\r\ninterruption for 140 miles southward to the R. Diamante, where it\r\nunites with the western ranges: northward, according to this same\r\nauthor, it terminates where the R. Mendoza debouches from the\r\nmountains; but a little further north in the eastern part of the Cumbre\r\nsection, there are, as we shall hereafter see, some mountain-masses of\r\na brick-red porphyry, the last injected amidst many other porphyries,\r\nand having so close an analogy with the coarse red granite of the\r\nPortillo line, that I am tempted to believe that they belong to the\r\nsame axis of injection; if so, the Portillo line is at least 200 miles\r\nin length. Its height, even in the lowest gap in the road, is 14,365\r\nfeet, and some of the pinnacles apparently attain an elevation of about\r\n16,000 feet above the sea. The geological history of this grand chain\r\nappears to me eminently interesting. We may safely conclude, that at a\r\nformer period the valley of Tenuyan existed as an arm of the sea, about\r\ntwenty-miles in width, bordered on one hand by a ridge or chain of\r\nislets of the black calcareous shales and purple sandstones of the\r\ngypseous formation; and on the other hand, by a ridge or chain of\r\nislets composed of mica-slate, white granite, and perhaps to a partial\r\nextent of red granite. These two chains, whilst thus bordering the old\r\nsea-channel, must have been exposed for a vast lapse of time to\r\nalluvial and littoral action, during which the rocks were shattered,\r\nthe fragments rounded, and the strata of conglomerate accumulated to a\r\nthickness of at least fifteen hundred or two thousand feet. The red\r\northitic granite now forms, as we have seen, the main part of the\r\nPortillo chain: it is injected in dikes not only into the mica-schist\r\nand white granites, but into the laminated sandstone, which it has\r\nmetamorphosed, and which it has thrown off, together with the\r\nconformably overlying coloured beds and stratified conglomerate, at an\r\nangle of forty-five degrees. To have thrown off so vast a pile of\r\nstrata at this angle, is a proof that the main part of the red granite\r\n(whether or not portions, as perhaps is probable, previously existed)\r\nwas injected in a liquified state after the accumulation both of the\r\nlaminated sandstone and of the conglomerate; this conglomerate, we\r\nknow, was accumulated, not only after the deposition of the\r\nfossiliferous strata of the Peuquenes line, but after their elevation\r\nand long-continued denudation: and these fossiliferous strata belong to\r\nthe early part of the Cretaceous system. Late, therefore, in a\r\ngeological sense, as must be the age of the main part of the red\r\ngranite, I can conceive nothing more impressive than the eastern view\r\nof this great range, as forcing the mind to grapple with the idea of\r\nthe thousands of thousands of years requisite for the denudation of the\r\nstrata which originally encased it,—for that the fluidified granite was\r\nonce encased, its mineralogical composition and structure, and the bold\r\nconical shape of the mountain-masses, yield sufficient evidence. Of the\r\nencasing strata we see the last vestiges in the coloured beds on the\r\ncrest, in the little caps of mica-schist on some of the loftiest\r\npinnacles, and in the isolated patches of this same rock at\r\ncorresponding heights on the now bare and steep flanks.\r\n\r\nThe lava-streams at the eastern foot of the Portillo are interesting,\r\nnot so much from the great denudation which they have suffered at a\r\ncomparatively late period as from the evidence they afford by their\r\ninclination taken conjointly with their thickness and compactness, that\r\nafter the great range had assumed its present general outline, it\r\ncontinued to rise as an axis of elevation. The plains extending from\r\nthe base of the Cordillera to the Atlantic show that the continent has\r\nbeen upraised in mass to a height of 3,500 feet, and probably to a much\r\ngreater height, for the smooth shingle-covered margin of the Pampas is\r\nprolonged in a gentle unbroken slope far up many of the great valleys.\r\nNor let it be assumed that the Peuquenes and Portillo ranges have\r\nundergone only movements of elevation; for we shall hereafter see, that\r\nthe bottom of the sea subsided several thousand feet during the\r\ndeposition of strata, occupying the same relative place in the\r\nCordillera, with those of the Peuquenes ridge; moreover, we shall see\r\nfrom the unequivocal evidence of buried upright trees, that at a\r\nsomewhat later period, during the formation of the Uspallata chain,\r\nwhich corresponds geographically with that of the Portillo, there was\r\nanother subsidence of many thousand feet: here, indeed, in the valley\r\nof Tenuyan, the accumulation of the coarse stratified conglomerate to a\r\nthickness of fifteen hundred or two thousand feet, offers strong\r\npresumptive evidence of subsidence; for all existing analogies lead to\r\nthe belief that large pebbles can be transported only in shallow water,\r\nliable to be affected by currents and movements of undulation—and if\r\nso, the shallow bed of the sea on which the pebbles were first\r\ndeposited must necessarily have sunk to allow of the accumulation of\r\nthe superincumbent strata. What a history of changes of level, and of\r\nwear and tear, all since the age of the latter secondary formations of\r\nEurope, does the structure of this one great mountain-chain reveal!\r\n\r\nPASSAGE OF THE ANDES BY THE CUMBRE OR USPALLATA PASS.\r\n\r\nThis Pass crosses the Andes about sixty miles north of that just\r\ndescribed: the section given in Plate 1, Section 1/2, is on the same\r\nscale as before, namely, at one-third of an inch to a mile in distance,\r\nand one inch to a mile (or 6,000 feet) in height. Like the last\r\nsection, it is a mere sketch, and cannot pretend to accuracy, though\r\nmade under favourable circumstances. We will commence as before, with\r\nthe western half, of which the main range bears the name of the Cumbre\r\n(that is the Ridge), and corresponds to the Peuquenes line in the\r\nformer section; as does the Uspallata range, though on a much smaller\r\nscale, to that of the Portillo. Near the point where the river\r\nAconcagua debouches on the basin plain of the same name, at a height of\r\nabout two thousand three hundred feet above the sea, we meet with the\r\nusual purple and greenish porphyritic claystone conglomerate. Beds of\r\nthis nature, alternating with numerous compact and amygdaloidal\r\nporphyries, which have flowed as submarine lavas, and associated with\r\ngreat mountain- masses of various, injected, non-stratified porphyries,\r\nare prolonged the whole distance up to the Cumbre or central ridge. One\r\nof the commonest stratified porphyries is of a green colour, highly\r\namygdaloidal with the various minerals described in the preliminary\r\ndiscussion, and including fine tabular crystals of albite. The\r\nmountain-range north (often with a little westing) and south. The\r\nstratification, wherever I could clearly distinguish it, was inclined\r\nwestward or towards the Pacific, and, except near the Cumbre, seldom at\r\nangles above 25 degrees. Only at one spot on this western side, on a\r\nlofty pinnacle not far from the Cumbre, I saw strata apparently\r\nbelonging to the gypseous formation, and conformably capping a pile of\r\nstratified porphyries. Hence, both in composition and in\r\nstratification, the structure of the mountains on this western side of\r\nthe divortium aquarum, is far more simple than in the corresponding\r\npart of the Peuquenes section. In the porphyritic claystone\r\nconglomerate, the mechanical structure and the planes of stratification\r\nhave generally been much obscured and even quite obliterated towards\r\nthe base of the series, whilst in the upper parts, near the summits of\r\nthe mountains, both are distinctly displayed. In these upper portions\r\nthe porphyries are generally lighter coloured. In three places [X, Y,\r\nZ] masses of andesite are exposed: at [Y], this rock contained some\r\nquartz, but the greater part consisted of andesitic porphyry, with only\r\na few well-developed crystals of albite, and forming a great white\r\nmass, having the external aspect of granite, capped by much dark\r\nunstratified porphyry. In many parts of the mountains, there are dikes\r\nof a green colour, and other white ones, which latter probably spring\r\nfrom underlying masses of andesite.\r\n\r\nThe Cumbre, where the road crosses it, is, according to Mr. Pentland,\r\n12,454 feet above the sea; and the neighbouring peaks, composed of dark\r\npurple and whitish porphyries, some obscurely stratified with a\r\nwesterly dip, and others without a trace of stratification, must exceed\r\n13,000 feet in height. Descending the eastern slope of the Cumbre, the\r\nstructure becomes very complicated, and generally differs on the two\r\nsides of the east and west line of road and section. First we come to a\r\ngreat mass [A] of nearly vertical, singularly contorted strata,\r\ncomposed of highly compact red sandstones, and of often calcareous\r\nconglomerates, and penetrated by green, yellow, and reddish dikes; but\r\nI shall presently have an opportunity of describing in some detail an\r\nanalogous pile of strata. These vertical beds are abruptly succeeded by\r\nothers [B], of apparently nearly the same nature but more\r\nmetamorphosed, alternating with porphyries and limestones; these dip\r\nfor a short space westward, but there has been here an extraordinary\r\ndislocation, which, on the north side of the road, appears to have\r\ndetermined the excavation of the north and south valley of the R. de\r\nlas Cuevas. On this northern side of the road, the strata [B] are\r\nprolonged till they come in close contact with a jagged lofty mountain\r\n[D] of dark- coloured, unstratified, intrusive porphyry, where the beds\r\nhave been more highly inclined and still more metamorphosed. This\r\nmountain of porphyry seems to form a short axis of elevation, for south\r\nof the road in its line there is a hill [C] of porphyritic conglomerate\r\nwith absolutely vertical strata.\r\n\r\nWe now come to the gypseous formation: I will first describe the\r\nstructure of the several mountains, and then give in one section a\r\ndetailed account of the nature of the rocks. On the north side of the\r\nroad, which here runs in an east and west valley, the mountain of\r\nporphyry [D] is succeeded by a hill [E] formed of the upper gypseous\r\nstrata tilted, at an angle of between 70 and 80 degrees to the west, by\r\na uniclinal axis of elevation which does not run parallel to the other\r\nneighbouring ranges, and which is of short length; for on the south\r\nside of the valley its prolongation is marked only by a small flexure\r\nin a pile of strata inclined by a quite separate axis. A little further\r\non the north and south valley of Horcones enters at right angles our\r\nline of section; its western side is bounded by a hill of gypseous\r\nstrata [F] dipping westward at about 45 degrees, and its eastern side\r\nby a mountain of similar strata [G] inclined westward at 70 degrees,\r\nand superimposed by an oblique fault on another mass of the same strata\r\n[H], also inclined westward, but at an angle of about 30 degrees: the\r\ncomplicated relation of these three masses [F, G, H] is explained by\r\nthe structure of a great mountain-range lying some way to the north, in\r\nwhich a regular anticlinal axis (represented in the section by dotted\r\nlines) is seen, with the strata on its eastern side again bending up\r\nand forming a distinct uniclinal axis, of which the beds marked [H]\r\nform the lower part. This great uniclinal line is intersected, near the\r\nPuente del Inca, by the valley along which the road runs, and the\r\nstrata composing it will be immediately described. On the south side of\r\nthe road, in the space corresponding with the mountains [E, F, and G],\r\nthe strata everywhere dip westward generally at an angle of 30 degrees,\r\noccasionally mounting up to 45 degrees, but not in an unbroken line,\r\nfor there are several vertical faults, forming separate uniclinal\r\nmasses, all dipping in the same direction,—a form of elevation common\r\nin the Cordillera. We thus see that within a narrow space, the gypseous\r\nstrata have been upheaved and crushed together by a great uniclinal,\r\nanticlinal, and one lesser uniclinal line [E] of elevation; and that\r\nbetween these three lines and the Cumbre, in the sandstones,\r\nconglomerates and porphyritic formation, there have been at least two\r\nor three other great elevatory axes.\r\n\r\nThe uniclinal axis [I] intersected near the Puente del Inca (of which\r\nthe strata at [H] form a part) ranges N. by W. and S. by E., forming a\r\nchain of mountains, apparently little inferior in height to the Cumbre:\r\nthe strata, as we have seen, dip at an average angle of 30 degrees to\r\nthe west. (At this place, there are some hot and cold springs, the\r\nwarmest having a temperature, according to Lieutenant Brand “Travels,”\r\npage 240, of 91 degrees; they emit much gas. According to Mr. Brande,\r\nof the Royal Institution, ten cubical inches contain forty-five grains\r\nof solid matter, consisting chiefly of salt, gypsum, carbonate of lime,\r\nand oxide of iron. The water is charged with carbonic acid and\r\nsulphuretted hydrogen. These springs deposit much tufa in the form of\r\nspherical balls. They burst forth, as do those of Cauquenes, and\r\nprobably those of Villa Vicencio, on a line of elevation.) The flanks\r\nof the mountains are here quite bare and steep, affording an excellent\r\nsection; so that I was able to inspect the strata to a thickness of\r\nabout 4,000 feet, and could clearly distinguish their general nature\r\nfor 1,000 feet higher, making a total thickness of 5,000 feet, to which\r\nmust be added about 1,000 feet of the inferior strata seen a little\r\nlower down the valley, I will describe this one section in detail,\r\nbeginning at the bottom.\r\n\r\n1st. The lowest mass is the altered clay-slate described in the\r\npreliminary discussion, and which in this line of section was here\r\nfirst met with. Lower down the valley, at the R. de las Vacas, I had a\r\nbetter opportunity of examining it; it is there in some parts well\r\ncharacterised, having a distinct, nearly vertical, tortuous cleavage,\r\nranging N.W. and S.E., and intersected by quartz veins: in most parts,\r\nhowever, it is crystalline and feldspathic, and passes into a true\r\ngreenstone often including grains of quartz. The clay-slate, in its\r\nupper half, is frequently brecciated, the embedded angular fragments\r\nbeing of nearly the same nature with the paste.\r\n\r\n2nd. Several strata of purplish porphyritic conglomerate, of no very\r\ngreat thickness, rest conformably upon the feldspathic slate. A thick\r\nbed of fine, purple, claystone porphyry, obscurely brecciated (but not\r\nof metamorphosed sedimentary origin), and capped by porphyritic\r\nconglomerate, was the lowest bed actually examined in this section at\r\nthe Puente del Inca.\r\n\r\n3rd. A stratum, eighty feet thick, of hard and very compact impure\r\nwhitish limestone, weathering bright red, with included layers\r\nbrecciated and re- cemented. Obscure marks of shell are distinguishable\r\nin it.\r\n\r\n4th. A red, quartzose, fine-grained conglomerate, with grains of\r\nquartz, and with patches of white earthy feldspar, apparently due to\r\nsome process of concretionary crystalline action; this bed is more\r\ncompact and metamorphosed than any of the overlying conglomerates.\r\n\r\n5th. A whitish cherty limestone, with nodules of bluish argillaceous\r\nlimestone.\r\n\r\n6th. A white conglomerate, with many particles of quartz, almost\r\nblending into the paste.\r\n\r\n7th. Highly siliceous, fine-grained white sandstone.\r\n\r\n8th and 9th. Red and white beds not examined.\r\n\r\n10th. Yellow, fine-grained, thinly stratified, magnesian (judging from\r\nits slow dissolution in acids) limestone: it includes some white quartz\r\npebbles, and little cavities, lined with calcareous spar, some\r\nretaining the form of shells.\r\n\r\n11th. A bed between twenty and thirty feet thick, quite conformable\r\nwith the underlying ones, composed of a hard basis, tinged lilac-grey\r\nporphyritic with NUMEROUS crystals of whitish feldspar, with black mica\r\nand little spots of soft ferruginous matter: evidently a submarine\r\nlava.\r\n\r\n12th. Yellow magnesian limestone, as before, part-stained purple.\r\n\r\n13th. A most singular rock; basis purplish grey, obscurely crystalline,\r\neasily fusible into a dark green glass, not hard, thickly speckled with\r\ncrystals more or less perfect of white carbonate of lime, of red\r\nhydrous oxide of iron, of a white and transparent mineral like\r\nanalcime, and of a green opaque mineral like soap-stone; the basis is\r\nmoreover amygdaloidal with many spherical balls of white crystallised\r\ncarbonate of lime, of which some are coated with the red oxide of iron.\r\nI have no doubt, from the examination of a superincumbent stratum (19),\r\nthat this is a submarine lava; though in Northern Chile, some of the\r\nmetamorphosed sedimentary beds are almost as crystalline, and of as\r\nvaried composition.\r\n\r\n14th. Red sandstone, passing in the upper part into a coarse, hard, red\r\nconglomerate, 300 feet thick, having a calcareous cement, and including\r\ngrains of quartz and broken crystals of feldspar; basis infusible; the\r\npebbles consist of dull purplish porphyries, with some of quartz, from\r\nthe size of a nut to a man’s head. This is the coarsest conglomerate in\r\nthis part of the Cordillera: in the middle there was a white layer not\r\nexamined.\r\n\r\n15th. Grand thick bed, of a very hard, yellowish-white rock, with a\r\ncrystalline feldspathic base, including large crystals of white\r\nfeldspar, many little cavities mostly full of soft ferruginous matter,\r\nand numerous hexagonal plates of black mica. The upper part of this\r\ngreat bed is slightly cellular; the lower part compact: the thickness\r\nvaried a little in different parts. Manifestly a submarine lava; and is\r\nallied to bed 11.\r\n\r\n16th and 17th. Dull purplish, calcareous, fine-grained, compact\r\nsandstones, which pass into coarse white conglomerates with numerous\r\nparticles of quartz.\r\n\r\n18th. Several alternations of red conglomerate, purplish sandstone, and\r\nsubmarine lava, like that singular rock forming bed 13.\r\n\r\n19th. A very heavy, compact, greenish-black stone, with a fine-grained\r\nobviously crystalline basis, containing a few specks of white\r\ncalcareous spar, many specks of the crystallised hydrous red oxide of\r\niron, and some specks of a green mineral; there are veins and nests\r\nfilled with epidote: certainly a submarine lava.\r\n\r\n20th. Many thin strata of compact, fine-grained, pale purple sandstone.\r\n\r\n21st. Gypsum in a nearly pure state, about three hundred feet in\r\nthickness: this bed, in its concretions of anhydrite and layers of\r\nsmall blackish crystals of carbonate of lime, exactly resembles the\r\ngreat gypseous beds in the Peuquenes range.\r\n\r\n22nd. Pale purple and reddish sandstone, as in bed 20: about three\r\nhundred feet in thickness.\r\n\r\n23rd. A thick mass composed of layers, often as thin as paper and\r\nconvoluted, of pure gypsum with others very impure, of a purplish\r\ncolour.\r\n\r\n24th. Pure gypsum, thick mass.\r\n\r\n25th. Red sandstones, of great thickness.\r\n\r\n26th. Pure gypsum, of great thickness.\r\n\r\n27th. Alternating layers of pure and impure gypsum, of great thickness.\r\n\r\nI was not able to ascend to these few last great strata, which compose\r\nthe neighbouring loftiest pinnacles. The thickness, from the lowest to\r\nthe uppermost bed of gypsum, cannot be less than 2,000 feet: the beds\r\nbeneath I estimated at 3,000 feet, and this does not include either the\r\nlower parts of the porphyritic conglomerate, or the altered clay-slate;\r\nI conceive the total thickness must be about six thousand feet. I\r\ndistinctly observed that not only the gypsum, but the alternating\r\nsandstones and conglomerates were lens-shaped, and repeatedly thinned\r\nout and replaced each other: thus in the distance of about a mile, a\r\nbed 300 feet thick of sandstone between two beds of gypsum, thinned out\r\nto nothing and disappeared. The lower part of this section differs\r\nremarkably,—in the much greater diversity of its mineralogical\r\ncomposition,—in the abundance of calcareous matter,—in the greater\r\ncoarseness of some of the conglomerates,—and in the numerous particles\r\nand well-rounded pebbles, sometimes of large size, of quartz,— from any\r\nother section hitherto described in Chile. From these peculiarities and\r\nfrom the lens-form of the strata, it is probable that this great pile\r\nof strata was accumulated on a shallow and very uneven bottom, near\r\nsome pre-existing land formed of various porphyries and quartz-rock.\r\nThe formation of porphyritic claystone conglomerate does not in this\r\nsection attain nearly its ordinary thickness; this may be PARTLY\r\nattributed to the metamorphic action having been here much less\r\nenergetic than usual, though the lower beds have been affected to a\r\ncertain degree. If it had been as energetic as in most other parts of\r\nChile, many of the beds of sandstone and conglomerate, containing\r\nrounded masses of porphyry, would doubtless have been converted into\r\nporphyritic conglomerate; and these would have alternated with, and\r\neven blended into, crystalline and porphyritic strata without a trace\r\nof mechanical structure,—namely, into those which, in the present state\r\nof the section, we see are unquestionably submarine lavas.\r\n\r\nThe beds of gypsum, together with the red alternating sandstones and\r\nconglomerates, present so perfect and curious a resemblance with those\r\nseen in our former section in the basin-valley of Yeso, that I cannot\r\ndoubt the identity of the two formations: I may add, that a little\r\nwestward of the P. del Inca, a mass of gypsum passed into a\r\nfine-grained, hard, brown sandstone, which contained some layers of\r\nblack, calcareous, compact, shaly rock, precisely like that seen in\r\nsuch vast masses on the Peuquenes range.\r\n\r\nNear the Puente del Inca, numerous fragments of limestone, containing\r\nsome fossil remains, were scattered on the ground: these fragments so\r\nperfectly resemble the limestone of bed No. 3, in which I saw\r\nimpressions of shells, that I have no doubt they have fallen from it.\r\nThe yellow magnesian limestone of bed No. 10, which also includes\r\ntraces of shells, has a different appearance. These fossils (as named\r\nby M. d’Orbigny) consist of:—\r\n\r\nGryphaea, near to G. Couloni (Neocomian formation). Arca, perhaps A.\r\nGabrielis, d’Orbigny, “Pal. Franc.” (Neocomian formation).\r\n\r\nMr. Pentland made a collection of shells from this same spot, and Von\r\nBuch considers them as consisting of:—\r\n\r\nTrigonia, resembling in form T. costata. Pholadomya, like one found by\r\nM. Dufresnoy near Alencon. Isocardi excentrica, Voltz., identical with\r\nthat from the Jura. (“Description Phys. des Iles Can.” page 472.)\r\n\r\nTwo of these shells, namely, the Gryphaea and Trigonia, appear to be\r\nidentical with species collected by Meyen and myself on the Peuquenes\r\nrange; and in the opinion of Von Buch and M. d’Orbigny, the two\r\nformations belong to the same age. I must here add, that Professor E.\r\nForbes, who has examined my specimens from this place and from the\r\nPeuquenes range, has likewise a strong impression that they indicate\r\nthe Cretaceous period, and probably an early epoch in it: so that all\r\nthe palaeontologists who have seen these fossils nearly coincide in\r\nopinion regarding their age. The limestone, however, with these fossils\r\nhere lies at the very base of the formation, just above the porphyritic\r\nconglomerate, and certainly several thousand feet lower in the series,\r\nthan the equivalent, fossiliferous, black, shaly rocks high up on the\r\nPeuquenes range.\r\n\r\nIt is well worthy of remark that these shells, or at least those of\r\nwhich I saw impressions in the limestone (bed No. 3), must have been\r\ncovered up, on the LEAST computation, by 4,000 feet of strata: now we\r\nknow from Professor E. Forbes’s researches, that the sea at greater\r\ndepths than 600 feet becomes exceedingly barren of organic beings,—a\r\nresult quite in accordance with what little I have seen of deep-sea\r\nsoundings. Hence, after this limestone with its shells was deposited,\r\nthe bottom of the sea where the main line of the Cordillera now stands,\r\nmust have subsided some thousand feet to allow of the deposition of the\r\nsuperincumbent submarine strata. Without supposing a movement of this\r\nkind, it would, moreover, be impossible to understand the accumulation\r\nof the several lower strata of COARSE, well-rounded conglomerates,\r\nwhich it is scarcely possible to believe were spread out in profoundly\r\ndeep water, and which, especially those containing pebbles of quartz,\r\ncould hardly have been rounded in submarine craters and afterwards\r\nejected from them, as I believe to have been the case with much of the\r\nporphyritic conglomerate formation. I may add that, in Professor\r\nForbes’s opinion, the above-enumerated species of mollusca probably did\r\nnot live at a much greater depth than twenty fathoms, that is only 120\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nTo return to our section down the valley; standing on the great N. by\r\nW. and S. by E. uniclinal axis of the Puente del Inca, of which a\r\nsection has just been given, and looking north-east, greater tabular\r\nmasses of gypseous formation (KK) could be seen in the distance, very\r\nslightly inclined towards the east. Lower down the valley, the\r\nmountains are almost exclusively composed of porphyries, many of them\r\nof intrusive origin and non-stratified, others stratified, but with the\r\nstratification seldom distinguishable except in the upper parts.\r\nDisregarding local disturbances, the beds are either horizontal or\r\ninclined at a small angle eastwards: hence, when standing on the plain\r\nof Uspallata and looking to the west or backwards, the Cordillera\r\nappear composed of huge, square, nearly horizontal, tabular masses: so\r\nwide a space, with such lofty mountains so equably elevated, is rarely\r\nmet with within the Cordillera. In this line of section, the interval\r\nbetween the Puente del Inca and the neighbourhood of the Cumbre,\r\nincludes all the chief axes of dislocation.\r\n\r\nThe altered clay-slate formation, already described, is seen in several\r\nparts of the valley as far down as Las Vacas, underlying the\r\nporphyritic conglomerate. At the Casa de Pujios [L], there is a hummock\r\nof (andesitic?) granite; and the stratification of the surrounding\r\nmountains here changes from W. by S. to S.W. Again, near the R. Vacas\r\nthere is a larger formation of (andesitic?) granite [M], which sends a\r\nmeshwork of veins into the superincumbent clay-slate, and which locally\r\nthrows off the strata, on one side to N.W. and on the other to S.E. but\r\nnot at a high angle: at the junction, the clay-slate is altered into\r\nfine-grained greenstone. This granitic axis is intersected by a green\r\ndike, which I mention, because I do not remember having elsewhere seen\r\ndikes in this lowest and latest intrusive rock. From the R. Vacas to\r\nthe plain of Uspallata, the valley runs N.E., so that I have had to\r\ncontract my section; it runs exclusively through porphyritic rocks. As\r\nfar as the Pass of Jaula, the claystone conglomerate formation, in most\r\nparts highly porphyritic, and crossed by numerous dikes of greenstone\r\nporphyry, attains a great thickness: there is also much intrusive\r\nporphyry. From the Jaula to the plain, the stratification has been in\r\nmost places obliterated, except near the tops of some of the mountains;\r\nand the metamorphic action has been extremely great. In this space, the\r\nnumber and bulk of the intrusive masses of differently coloured\r\nporphyries, injected one into another and intersected by dikes, is\r\ntruly extraordinary. I saw one mountain of whitish porphyry, from which\r\ntwo huge dikes, thinning out, branched DOWNWARDS into an adjoining\r\nblackish porphyry. Another hill of white porphyry, which had burst\r\nthrough dark- coloured strata, was itself injected by a purple,\r\nbrecciated, and recemented porphyry, both being crossed by a green\r\ndike, and both having been upheaved and injected by a granitic dome.\r\nOne brick-red porphyry, which above the Jaula forms an isolated mass in\r\nthe midst of the porphyritic conglomerate formation, and lower down the\r\nvalley a magnificent group of peaked mountains, differs remarkably from\r\nall the other porphyries. It consists of a red feldspathic base,\r\nincluding some rather large crystals of red feldspar, numerous large\r\nangular grains of quartz, and little bits of a soft green mineral\r\nanswering in most of its characters to soapstone. The crystals of red\r\nfeldspar resemble in external appearance those of orthite, though, from\r\nbeing partially decomposed, I was unable to measure them; and they\r\ncertainly are quite unlike the variety, so abundantly met with in\r\nalmost all the other rocks of this line of section, and which, wherever\r\nI tried it, cleaved like albite. This brick-red porphyry appears to\r\nhave burst through all the other porphyries, and numerous red dikes\r\ntraversing the neighbouring mountains have proceeded from it: in some\r\nfew places, however, it was intersected by white dikes. From this\r\nposteriority of intrusive origin,—from the close general resemblance\r\nbetween this red porphyry and the red granite of the Portillo line, the\r\nonly difference being that the feldspar here is less perfectly\r\ngranular, and that soapstone replaces the mica, which is there\r\nimperfect and passes into chlorite,—and from the Portillo line a little\r\nsouthward of this point appearing to blend (according to Dr. Gillies)\r\ninto the western ranges,—I am strongly urged to believe (as formerly\r\nremarked) that the grand mountain-masses composed of this brick-red\r\nporphyry belong to the same axis of injection with the granite of the\r\nPortillo line; if so, the injection of this porphyry probably took\r\nplace, as long subsequently to the several axes of elevation in the\r\ngypseous formation near the Cumbre, as the injection of the Portillo\r\ngranite has been shown to have been subsequent to the elevation of the\r\ngypseous strata composing the Peuquenes range; and this interval, we\r\nhave seen, must have been a very long one.\r\n\r\nThe Plain of Uspallata has been briefly described in Chapter 3; it\r\nresembles the basin-plains of Chile; it is ten or fifteen miles wide,\r\nand is said to extend for 180 miles northward; its surface is nearly\r\nsix thousand feet above the sea; it is composed, to a thickness of some\r\nhundred feet of loosely aggregated, stratified shingle, which is\r\nprolonged with a gently sloping surface up the valleys in the mountains\r\non both sides. One section in this plain [Z] is interesting, from the\r\nunusual circumstance of alternating layers of almost loose red and\r\nwhite sand with lines of pebbles (from the size of a nut to that of an\r\napple), and beds of gravel, being inclined at an angle of 45 degrees,\r\nand in some spots even at a higher angle. (I find that Mr. Smith of\r\nJordan Hill has described (“Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal” volume\r\n25 page 392) beds of sand and gravel, near Edinburgh, tilted at an\r\nangle of 60 degrees, and dislocated by miniature faults.) These beds\r\nare dislocated by small faults: and are capped by a thick mass of\r\nhorizontally stratified gravel, evidently of subaqueous origin. Having\r\nbeen accustomed to observe the irregularities of beds accumulated under\r\ncurrents, I feel sure that the inclination here has not been thus\r\nproduced. The pebbles consist chiefly of the brick-red porphyry just\r\ndescribed and of white granite, both probably derived from the ranges\r\nto the west, and of altered clay-slate and of certain porphyries,\r\napparently belonging to the rocks of the Uspallata chain. This plain\r\ncorresponds geographically with the valley of Tenuyan between the\r\nPortillo and Peuquenes ranges; but in that valley the shingle, which\r\nlikewise has been derived both from the eastern and western ranges, has\r\nbeen cemented into a hard conglomerate, and has been throughout tilted\r\nat a considerable inclination; the gravel there apparently attains a\r\nmuch greater thickness, and is probably of higher antiquity.\r\n\r\nTHE USPALLATA RANGE.\r\n\r\nThe road by the Villa Vicencio Pass does not strike directly across the\r\nrange, but runs for some leagues northward along its western base: and\r\nI must briefly describe the rocks here seen, before continuing with the\r\ncoloured east and west section. At the mouth of the valley of Canota,\r\nand at several points northwards, there is an extensive formation of a\r\nglossy and harsh, and of a feldspathic clay-slate, including strata of\r\ngrauwacke, and having a tortuous, nearly vertical cleavage, traversed\r\nby numerous metalliferous veins and others of quartz. The clay-slate is\r\nin many parts capped by a thick mass of fragments of the same rock,\r\nfirmly recemented; and both together have been injected and broken up\r\nby very numerous hillocks, ranging north and south, of lilac, white,\r\ndark and salmon- coloured porphyries: one steep, now denuded, hillock\r\nof porphyry had its face as distinctly impressed with the angles of a\r\nfragmentary mass of the slate, with some of the points still remaining\r\nembedded, as sealing-wax could be by a seal. At the mouth of this same\r\nvalley of Canota, in a fine escarpment having the strata dipping from\r\n50 to 60 degrees to the N.E. (Nearly opposite to this escarpment, there\r\nis another corresponding one, with the strata dipping not to the\r\nexactly opposite point, or S.W., but to S.S.W.: consequently the two\r\nescarpments trend towards each other, and some miles southward they\r\nbecome actually united: this is a form of elevation which I have not\r\nelsewhere seen.), the clay-slate formation is seen to be covered\r\nby—(1st) a purple, claystone porphyry resting unconformably in some\r\nparts on the solid slate, and in others on a thick fragmentary mass;\r\n(2nd), a conformable stratum of compact blackish rock, having a\r\nspheroidal structure, full of minute acicular crystals of glassy\r\nfeldspar, with red spots of oxide of iron; (3rd), a great stratum of\r\npurplish-red claystone porphyry, abounding with crystals of opaque\r\nfeldspar, and laminated with thin, parallel, often short, layers, and\r\nlikewise with great irregular patches of white, earthy,\r\nsemi-crystalline feldspar; this rock (which I noticed in other\r\nneighbouring places) perfectly resembles a curious variety described at\r\nPort Desire, and occasionally occurs in the great porphyritic\r\nconglomerate formation of Chile; (4th), a thin stratum of greenish\r\nwhite, indurated tuff, fusible and containing broken crystals and\r\nparticles of porphyries; (5th), a grand mass, imperfectly columnar and\r\ndivided into three parallel and closely joined strata, of\r\ncream-coloured claystone porphyry; (6th), a thick stratum of\r\nlilac-coloured porphyry, which I could see was capped by another bed of\r\nthe cream-coloured variety; I was unable to examine the still higher\r\nparts of the escarpment. These conformably stratified porphyries,\r\nthough none are either vesicular are amygdaloidal, have evidently\r\nflowed as submarine lavas: some of them are separated from each other\r\nby seams of indurated tuff, which, however, are quite insignificant in\r\nthickness compared with the porphyries. This whole pile resembles, but\r\nnot very closely, some of the less brecciated parts of the great\r\nporphyritic conglomerate formation of Chile; but it does not probably\r\nbelong to the same age, as the porphyries here rest unconformably on\r\nthe altered feldspathic clay-slate, whereas the porphyritic\r\nconglomerate formation alternates with and rests conformably on it.\r\nThese porphyries, moreover, with the exception of the one blackish\r\nstratum, and of the one indurated, white tufaceous bed, differ from the\r\nbeds composing the Uspallata range in the line of the Villa Vicencio\r\nPass.\r\n\r\nI will now give, first, a sketch of the structure of the range, as\r\nrepresented in the section, and will then describe its composition and\r\ninteresting history. At its western foot, a hillock [N] is seen to rise\r\nout of the plain, with its strata dipping at 70 degrees to the west,\r\nfronted by strata [O] inclined at 45 degrees to the east, thus forming\r\na little north and south anticlinal axis. Some other little hillocks of\r\nsimilar composition, with their strata highly inclined, range N.E. and\r\nS.W., obliquely to the main Uspallata line. The cause of these\r\ndislocations, which, though on a small scale, have been violent and\r\ncomplicated, is seen to lie in hummocks of lilac, purple and red\r\nporphyries, which have been injected in a liquified state through and\r\ninto the underlying clay-slate formation. Several dykes were exposed\r\nhere, but in no other part, that I saw of this range. As the strata\r\nconsist of black, white, greenish and brown-coloured rocks, and as the\r\nintrusive porphyries are so brightly tinted, a most extraordinary view\r\nwas presented, like a coloured geological drawing. On the gently\r\ninclined main western slope [PP], above the little anticlinal ridges\r\njust mentioned, the strata dip at an average angle of 25 degrees to the\r\nwest; the inclination in some places being only 19 degrees, in some few\r\nothers as much as 45 degrees. The masses having these different\r\ninclinations, are separated from each other by parallel vertical faults\r\n[as represented at Pa], often giving rise to separate, parallel,\r\nuniclinal ridges. The summit of the main range is broad and undulatory,\r\nwith the stratification undulatory and irregular: in a few places\r\ngranitic and porphyritic masses [Q] protrude, which, from the small\r\neffect they have locally produced in deranging the strata, probably\r\nform the upper points of a regular, great underlying dome. These\r\ndenuded granitic points, I estimated at about nine thousand feet in\r\nheight above the sea. On the eastern slope, the strata in the upper\r\npart are regularly inclined at about 25 degrees to the east, so that\r\nthe summit of this chain, neglecting small irregularities, forms a\r\nbroad anticlinal axis. Lower down, however, near Los Hornillos [R],\r\nthere is a well-marked synclinal axis, beyond which the strata are\r\ninclined at nearly the same angle, namely from 20 to 30 degrees,\r\ninwards or westward. Owing to the amount of denudation which this chain\r\nhas suffered, the outline of the gently inclined eastern flank scarcely\r\noffers the slightest indication of this synclinal axis. The stratified\r\nbeds, which we have hitherto followed across the range, a little\r\nfurther down are seen to lie, I believe unconformably, on a broad\r\nmountainous band of clay-slate and grauwacke. The strata and laminae of\r\nthis latter formation, on the extreme eastern flank, are generally\r\nnearly vertical; further inwards they become inclined from 45 to 80\r\ndegrees to the west: near Villa Vicencio [S] there is apparently an\r\nanticlinal axis, but the structure of this outer part of the clay-slate\r\nformation is so obscure, that I have not marked the planes of\r\nstratification in the section. On the margin of the Pampas, some low,\r\nmuch dislocated spurs of this same formation, project in a north-\r\neasterly line, in the same oblique manner as do the ridges on the\r\nwestern foot, and as is so frequently the case with those at the base\r\nof the main Cordillera.\r\n\r\nI will now describe the nature of the beds, beginning at the base on\r\nthe eastern side. First, for the clay-slate formation: the slate is\r\ngenerally hard and bluish, with the laminae coated by minute micaceous\r\nscales; it alternates many times with a coarse-grained, greenish\r\ngrauwacke, containing rounded fragments of quartz and bits of slate in\r\na slightly calcareous basis. The slate in the upper part generally\r\nbecomes purplish, and the cleavage so irregular that the whole consists\r\nof mere splinters. Transverse veins of quartz are numerous. At the\r\nCalera, some leagues distant, there is a dark crystalline limestone,\r\napparently included in this formation. With the exception of the\r\ngrauwacke being here more abundant, and the clay-slate less altered,\r\nthis formation closely resembles that unconformably underlying the\r\nporphyries at the western foot of this same range; and likewise that\r\nalternating with the porphyritic conglomerate in the main Cordillera.\r\nThis formation is a considerable one, and extends several leagues\r\nsouthward to near Mendoza: the mountains composed of it rise to a\r\nheight of about two thousand feet above the edge of the Pampas, or\r\nabout seven thousand feet above the sea. (I infer this from the height\r\nof V. Vicencio, which was ascertained by Mr. Miers to be 5,328 feet\r\nabove the sea.)\r\n\r\nSecondly: the most usual bed on the clay-slate is a coarse, white,\r\nslightly calcareous conglomerate, of no great thickness, including\r\nbroken crystals of feldspar, grains of quartz, and numerous pebbles of\r\nbrecciated claystone porphyry, but without any pebbles of the\r\nunderlying clay-slate. I nowhere saw the actual junction between this\r\nbed and the clay-slate, though I spent a whole day in endeavouring to\r\ndiscover their relations. In some places I distinctly saw the white\r\nconglomerate and overlying beds inclined at from 25 to 30 degrees to\r\nthe west, and at the bottom of the same mountain, the clay-slate and\r\ngrauwacke inclined to the same point, but at an angle from 70 to 80\r\ndegrees: in one instance, the clay-slate dipped not only at a different\r\nangle, but to a different point from the overlying formation. In these\r\ncases the two formations certainly appeared quite unconformable:\r\nmoreover, I found in the clay-slate one great, vertical, dike-like\r\nfissure, filled up with an indurated whitish tuff, quite similar to\r\nsome of the upper beds presently to be described; and this shows that\r\nthe clay-slate must have been consolidated and dislocated before their\r\ndeposition. On the other hand, the stratification of the slate and\r\ngrauwacke, in some cases gradually and entirely disappeared in\r\napproaching the overlying white conglomerate; in other cases the\r\nstratification of the two formations became strictly conformable; and\r\nagain in other cases, there was some tolerably well characterised\r\nclay-slate lying above the conglomerate. (The coarse, mechanical\r\nstructure of many grauwackes has always appeared to me a difficulty;\r\nfor the texture of the associated clay-slate and the nature of the\r\nembedded organic remains where present, indicate that the whole has\r\nbeen a deep-water deposit. Whence have the sometimes included angular\r\nfragments of clay-slate, and the rounded masses of quartz and other\r\nrocks, been derived? Many deep-water limestones, it is well known, have\r\nbeen brecciated, and then firmly recemented.) The most probable\r\nconclusion appears to be, that after the clay-slate formation had been\r\ndislocated and tilted, but whilst under the sea, a fresh and more\r\nrecent deposition of clay-slate took place, on which the white\r\nconglomerate was conformably deposited, with here and there a thin\r\nintercalated bed of clay-slate. On this view the white conglomerates\r\nand the presently to be described tuffs and lavas are really\r\nunconformable to the main part of the clay-slate; and this, as we have\r\nseen, certainly is the case with the clay-stone lavas in the valley of\r\nCanota, at the western and opposite base of the range.\r\n\r\nThirdly: on the white conglomerate, strata several hundred feet in\r\nthickness are superimposed, varying much in nature in short distances:\r\nthe commonest variety is a white, much indurated tuff, sometimes\r\nslightly calcareous, with ferruginous spots and water-lines, often\r\npassing into whitish or purplish compact, fine-grained grit or\r\nsandstones; other varieties become semi-porcellanic, and tinted faint\r\ngreen or blue; others pass into an indurated shale: most of these\r\nvarieties are easily fusible.\r\n\r\nFourthly: a bed, about one hundred feet thick of a compact, partially\r\ncolumnar, pale-grey, feldspathic lava, stained with iron, including\r\nvery numerous crystals of opaque feldspar, and with some crystallised\r\nand disseminated calcareous matter. The tufaceous stratum on which this\r\nfeldspathic lava rests is much hardened, stained purple, and has a\r\nspherico-concretionary structure; it here contains a good many pebbles\r\nof claystone porphyry.\r\n\r\nFifthly: thin beds, 400 feet in thickness, varying much in nature,\r\nconsisting of white and ferruginous tuffs, in some parts having a\r\nconcretionary structure, in others containing rounded grains and a few\r\npebbles of quartz; also passing into hard gritstones and into greenish\r\nmudstones: there is, also, much of a bluish-grey and green\r\nsemi-porcellanic stone.\r\n\r\nSixthly: a volcanic stratum, 250 feet in thickness, of so varying a\r\nnature that I do not believe a score of specimens would show all the\r\nvarieties; much is highly amygdaloidal, much compact; there are\r\ngreenish, blackish, purplish, and grey varieties, rarely including\r\ncrystals of green augite and minute acicular ones of feldspar, but\r\noften crystals and amygdaloidal masses of white, red, and black\r\ncarbonate of lime. Some of the blackish varieties of this rock have a\r\nconchoidal fracture and resemble basalt; others have an irregular\r\nfracture. Some of the grey and purplish varieties are thickly speckled\r\nwith green earth and with white crystalline carbonate of lime; others\r\nare largely amygdaloidal with green earth and calcareous spar. Again,\r\nother earthy varieties, of greenish, purplish and grey tints, contain\r\nmuch iron, and are almost half composed of amygdaloidal balls of dark\r\nbrown bole, of a whitish indurated feldspathic matter, of bright green\r\nearth, of agate, and of black and white crystallised carbonate of lime.\r\nAll these varieties are easily fusible. Viewed from a distance, the\r\nline of junction with the underlying semi-porcellanic strata was\r\ndistinct; but when examined closely, it was impossible to point out\r\nwithin a foot where the lava ended and where the sedimentary mass\r\nbegan: the rock at the time of junction was in most places hard, of a\r\nbright green colour, and abounded with irregular amygdaloidal masses of\r\nferruginous and pure calcareous spar, and of agate.\r\n\r\nSeventhly: strata, eighty feet in thickness, of various indurated\r\ntuffs, as before; many of the varieties have a fine basis including\r\nrather coarse extraneous particles; some of them are compact and\r\nsemi-porcellanic, and include vegetable impressions.\r\n\r\nEighthly: a bed, about fifty feet thick, of greenish-grey, compact,\r\nfeldspathic lava, with numerous small crystals of opaque feldspar,\r\nblack augite, and oxide of iron. The junction with the bed on which it\r\nrested, was ill defined; balls and masses of the feldspathic rock being\r\nenclosed in much altered tuff.\r\n\r\nNinthly: indurated tuffs, as before.\r\n\r\nTenthly: a conformable layer, less than two feet in thickness, of\r\npitchstone, generally brecciated, and traversed by veins of agate and\r\nof carbonate of lime: parts are composed of apparently concretionary\r\nfragments of a more perfect variety, arranged in horizontal lines in a\r\nless perfectly characterised variety. I have much difficulty in\r\nbelieving that this thin layer of pitchstone flowed as lava.\r\n\r\nEleventhly: sedimentary and tufaceous beds as before, passing into\r\nsandstone, including some conglomerate: the pebbles in the latter are\r\nof claystone porphyry, well rounded, and some as large as\r\ncricket-balls.\r\n\r\nTwelfthly: a bed of compact, sonorous, feldspathic lava, like that of\r\nbed No. 8, divided by numerous joints into large angular blocks.\r\n\r\nThirteenthly: sedimentary beds as before.\r\n\r\nFourteenthly: a thick bed of greenish or greyish black, compact basalt\r\n(fusing into a black enamel), with small crystals, occasionally\r\ndistinguishable, of feldspar and augite: the junction with the\r\nunderlying sedimentary bed, differently from that in most of the\r\nforegoing streams, here was quite distinct:—the lava and tufaceous\r\nmatter preserving their perfect characters within two inches of each\r\nother. This rock closely resembles certain parts of that varied and\r\nsingular lava-stream No. 6; it likewise resembles, as we shall\r\nimmediately see, many of the great upper beds on the western flank and\r\non the summit of this range.\r\n\r\nThe pile of strata here described attains a great thickness; and above\r\nthe last-mentioned volcanic stratum, there were several other great\r\ntufaceous beds alternating with submarine lavas, which I had not time\r\nto examine; but a corresponding series, several thousand feet in\r\nthickness, is well exhibited on the crest and western flank of the\r\nrange. Most of the lava- streams on the western side are of a jet-black\r\ncolour and basaltic nature; they are either compact and fine-grained,\r\nincluding minute crystals of augite and feldspar, or they are\r\ncoarse-grained and abound with rather large coppery-brown crystals of\r\nan augitic mineral. (Very easily fusible into a jet-black bead,\r\nattracted by the magnet: the crystals are too much tarnished to be\r\nmeasured by the goniometer.) Another variety was of a dull- red colour,\r\nhaving a claystone brecciated basis, including specks of oxide of iron\r\nand of calcareous spar, and amygdaloidal with green earth: there were\r\napparently several other varieties. These submarine lavas often exhibit\r\na spheroidal, and sometimes an imperfect columnar structure: their\r\nupper junctions are much more clearly defined than their lower\r\njunctions; but the latter are not so much blended into the underlying\r\nsedimentary beds as is the case in the eastern flank. On the crest and\r\nwestern flank of the range, the streams, viewed as a whole, are mostly\r\nbasaltic; whilst those on the eastern side, which stand lower in the\r\nseries, are, as we have seen, mostly feldspathic.\r\n\r\nThe sedimentary strata alternating with the lavas on the crest and\r\nwestern side, are of an almost infinitely varying nature; but a large\r\nproportion of them closely resemble those already described on the\r\neastern flank: there are white and brown, indurated, easily fusible\r\ntuffs,—some passing into pale blue and green semi-porcellanic\r\nrocks,—others into brownish and purplish sandstones and gritstones,\r\noften including grains of quartz,— others into mudstone containing\r\nbroken crystals and particles of rock, and occasionally single large\r\npebbles. There was one stratum of a bright red, coarse, volcanic\r\ngritstone; another of conglomerate; another of a black, indurated,\r\ncarbonaceous shale marked with imperfect vegetable impressions; this\r\nlatter bed, which was thin, rested on a submarine lava, and followed\r\nall the considerable inequalities of its upper surface. Mr. Miers\r\nstates that coal has been found in this range. Lastly, there was a bed\r\n(like No. 10 on the eastern flank) evidently of sedimentary origin, and\r\nremarkable from closely approaching in character to an imperfect\r\npitchstone, and from including extremely thin layers of perfect\r\npitchstone, as well as nodules and irregular fragments (but not\r\nresembling extraneous fragments) of this same rock arranged in\r\nhorizontal lines: I conceive that this bed, which is only a few feet in\r\nthickness, must have assumed its present state through metamorphic and\r\nconcretionary action. Most of these sedimentary strata are much\r\nindurated, and no doubt have been partially metamorphosed: many of them\r\nare extraordinarily heavy and compact; others have agate and\r\ncrystalline carbonate of lime disseminated throughout them. Some of the\r\nbeds exhibit a singular concretionary arrangement, with the curves\r\ndetermined by the lines of fissure. There are many veins of agate and\r\ncalcareous spar, and innumerable ones of iron and other metals, which\r\nhave blackened and curiously affected the strata to considerable\r\ndistances on both sides.\r\n\r\nMany of these tufaceous beds resemble, with the exception of being more\r\nindurated, the upper beds of the Great Patagonian tertiary formation,\r\nespecially those variously coloured layers high up the River Santa\r\nCruz, and in a remarkable degree the tufaceous formation at the\r\nnorthern end of Chiloe. I was so much struck with this resemblance,\r\nthat I particularly looked out for silicified wood, and found it under\r\nthe following extraordinary circumstances. High up on this western\r\nflank, at a height estimated at 7,000 feet above the sea, in a broken\r\nescarpment of thin strata, composed of compact green gritstone passing\r\ninto a fine mudstone, and alternating with layers of coarser, brownish,\r\nvery heavy mudstone, including broken crystals and particles of rock\r\nalmost blended together, I counted the stumps of fifty-two trees. (For\r\nthe information of any future traveller, I will describe the spot in\r\ndetail. Proceeding eastward from the Agua del Zorro, and afterwards\r\nleaving on the north side of the road a rancho attached to some old\r\ngoldmines, you pass through a gully with low but steep rocks on each\r\nhand: the road then bends, and the ascent becomes steeper. A few\r\nhundred yards farther on, a stone’s throw on the south side of the\r\nroad, the white calcareous stumps may be seen. The spot is about half a\r\nmile east of the Agua del Zorro.) They projected between two and five\r\nfeet above the ground, and stood at exactly right angles to the strata,\r\nwhich were here inclined at an angle of about 25 degrees to the west.\r\nEleven of these trees were silicified and well preserved; Mr. R. Brown\r\nhas been so kind as to examine the wood when sliced and polished; he\r\nsays it is coniferous, partaking of the characters of the Araucarian\r\ntribe, with some curious points of affinity with the Yew. The bark\r\nround the trunks must have been circularly furrowed with irregular\r\nlines, for the mudstone round them is thus plainly marked. One cast\r\nconsisted of dark argillaceous limestone; and forty of them of coarsely\r\ncrystallised carbonate of lime, with cavities lined by quartz crystals:\r\nthese latter white calcareous columns do not retain any internal\r\nstructure, but their external form plainly shows their origin. All the\r\nstumps have nearly the same diameter, varying from one foot to eighteen\r\ninches; some of them stand within a yard of each other; they are\r\ngrouped in a clump within a space of about sixty yards across, with a\r\nfew scattered round at the distance of 150 yards. They all stand at\r\nabout the same level. The longest stump stood seven feet out of the\r\nground: the roots, if they are still preserved, are buried and\r\nconcealed. No one layer of the mudstone appeared much darker than the\r\nothers, as if it had formerly existed as soil, nor could this be\r\nexpected, for the same agents which replaced with silex and lime the\r\nwood of the trees, would naturally have removed all vegetable matter\r\nfrom the soil. Besides the fifty-two upright trees, there were a few\r\nfragments, like broken branches, horizontally embedded. The surrounding\r\nstrata are crossed by veins of carbonate of lime, agate, and oxide of\r\niron; and a poor gold vein has been worked not far from the trees.\r\n\r\nThe green and brown mudstone beds including the trees, are conformably\r\ncovered by much indurated, compact, white or ferruginous tuffs, which\r\npass upwards into a fine-grained, purplish sedimentary rock: these\r\nstrata, which, together, are from four to five hundred feet in\r\nthickness, rest on a thick bed of submarine lava, and are conformably\r\ncovered by another great mass of fine-grained basalt, which I estimated\r\nat 1,000 feet in thickness, and which probably has been formed by more\r\nthan one stream. (This rock is quite black, and fuses into a black\r\nbead, attracted strongly by the magnet; it breaks with a conchoidal\r\nfracture; the included crystals of augite are distinguishable by the\r\nnaked eye, but are not perfect enough to be measured: there are many\r\nminute acicular crystals of glassy feldspar.) Above this mass I could\r\nclearly distinguish five conformable alternations, each several hundred\r\nfeet in thickness, of stratified sedimentary rocks and lavas, such as\r\nhave been previously described. Certainly the upright trees have been\r\nburied under several thousand feet in thickness of matter, accumulated\r\nunder the sea. As the trees obviously must once have grown on dry land,\r\nwhat an enormous amount of subsidence is thus indicated! Nevertheless,\r\nhad it not been for the trees there was no appearance which would have\r\nled any one even to have conjectured that these strata had subsided. As\r\nthe land, moreover, on which the trees grew, is formed of subaqueous\r\ndeposits, of nearly if not quite equal thickness with the\r\nsuperincumbent strata, and as these deposits are regularly stratified\r\nand fine-grained, not like the matter thrown up on a sea-beach, a\r\nprevious upward movement, aided no doubt by the great accumulation of\r\nlavas and sediment, is also indicated. (At first I imagined, that the\r\nstrata with the trees might have been accumulated in a lake: but this\r\nseems highly improbable; for, first, a very deep lake was necessary to\r\nreceive the matter below the trees, then it must have been drained for\r\ntheir growth, and afterwards re-formed and made profoundly deep, so as\r\nto receive a subsequent accumulation of matter SEVERAL THOUSAND feet in\r\nthickness. And all this must have taken place necessarily before the\r\nformation of the Uspallata range, and therefore on the margin of the\r\nwide level expanse of the Pampas! Hence I conclude, that it is\r\ninfinitely more probable that the strata were accumulated under the\r\nsea: the vast amount of denudation, moreover, which this range has\r\nsuffered, as shown by the wide valleys, by the exposure of the very\r\ntrees and by other appearances, could have been effected, I conceive,\r\nonly by the long-continued action of the sea; and this shows that the\r\nrange was either upheaved from under the sea, or subsequently let down\r\ninto it. From the natural manner in which the stumps (fifty-two in\r\nnumber) are GROUPED IN A CLUMP, and from their all standing vertically\r\nto the strata, it is superfluous to speculate on the chance of the\r\ntrees having been drifted from adjoining land, and deposited upright: I\r\nmay, however, mention that the late Dr. Malcolmson assured me, that he\r\nonce met in the Indian Ocean, fifty miles from land, several cocoa-nut\r\ntrees floating upright, owing to their roots being loaded with earth.)\r\n\r\nIn nearly the middle of the range, there are some hills [Q], before\r\nalluded to, formed of a kind of granite externally resembling andesite,\r\nand consisting of a white, imperfectly granular, feldspathic basis,\r\nincluding some perfect crystals apparently of albite (but I was unable\r\nto measure them), much black mica, epidote in veins, and very little or\r\nno quartz. Numerous small veins branch from this rock into the\r\nsurrounding strata; and it is a singular fact that these veins, though\r\ncomposed of the same kind of feldspar and small scales of mica as in\r\nthe solid rock, abound with innumerable minute ROUNDED grains of\r\nquartz: in the veins or dikes also, branching from the great granitic\r\naxis in the peninsula of Tres Montes, I observed that quartz was more\r\nabundant in them than in the main rock: I have heard of other analogous\r\ncases: can we account for this fact, by the long-continued vicinity of\r\nquartz when cooling, and by its having been thus more easily sucked\r\ninto fissures than the other constituent minerals of granite? (See a\r\npaper by M. Elie de Beaumont, “Soc. Philomath.” May 1839 “L’Institut.”\r\n1839 page 161.) The strata encasing the flanks of these granitic or\r\nandesite masses, and forming a thick cap on one of their summits,\r\nappear originally to have been of the same tufaceous nature with the\r\nbeds already described, but they are now changed into porcellanic,\r\njaspery, and crystalline rocks, and into others of a white colour with\r\na harsh texture, and having a siliceous aspect, though really of a\r\nfeldspathic nature and fusible. Both the granitic intrusive masses and\r\nthe encasing strata are penetrated by innumerable metallic veins,\r\nmostly ferruginous and auriferous, but some containing copper-pyrites\r\nand a few silver: near the veins, the rocks are blackened as if blasted\r\nby gunpowder. The strata are only slightly dislocated close round these\r\nhills, and hence, perhaps, it may be inferred that the granitic masses\r\nform only the projecting points of a broad continuous axis-dome, which\r\nhas given to the upper parts of this range its anticlinal structure.\r\n\r\nCONCLUDING REMARKS ON THE USPALLATA RANGE.\r\n\r\nI will not attempt to estimate the total thickness of the pile of\r\nstrata forming this range, but it must amount to many thousand feet.\r\nThe sedimentary and tufaceous beds have throughout a general\r\nsimilarity, though with infinite variations. The submarine lavas in the\r\nlower part of the series are mostly feldspathic, whilst in the upper\r\npart, on the summit and western flank, they are mostly basaltic. We are\r\nthus reminded of the relative position in most recent volcanic\r\ndistricts of the trachytic and basaltic lavas,—the latter from their\r\ngreater weight having sunk to a lower level in the earth’s crust, and\r\nhaving consequently been erupted at a later period over the lighter and\r\nupper lavas of the trachytic series. (See on this subject, “Volcanic\r\nIslands” etc. by the Author.) Both the basaltic and feldspathic\r\nsubmarine streams are very compact; none being vesicular, and only a\r\nfew amygdaloidal: the effects which some of them, especially those low\r\nin the series, have produced on the tufaceous beds over which they have\r\nflowed is highly curious. Independently of this local metamorphic\r\naction, all the strata undoubtedly display an indurated and altered\r\ncharacter; and all the rocks of this range—the lavas, the alternating\r\nsediments, the intrusive granite and porphyries, and the underlying\r\nclay- slate—are intersected by metalliferous veins. The lava-strata can\r\noften be seen extending for great distances, conformably with the under\r\nand overlying beds; and it was obvious that they thickened towards the\r\nwest. Hence the points of eruption must have been situated westward of\r\nthe present range, in the direction of the main Cordillera: as,\r\nhowever, the flanks of the Cordillera are entirely composed of various\r\nporphyries, chiefly claystone and greenstone, some intrusive, and\r\nothers belonging to the porphyritic conglomerate formation, but all\r\nquite unlike these submarine lava-streams, we must in all probability\r\nlook to the plain of Uspallata for the now deeply buried points of\r\neruption.\r\n\r\nComparing our section of the Uspallata range with that of the Cumbre,\r\nwe see, with the exception of the underlying clay-slate, and perhaps of\r\nthe intrusive rocks of the axes, a striking dissimilarity in the strata\r\ncomposing them. The great porphyritic conglomerate formation has not\r\nextended as far as this range; nor have we here any of the gypseous\r\nstrata, the magnesian and other limestones, the red sandstones, the\r\nsiliceous beds with pebbles of quartz, and comparatively little of the\r\nconglomerates, all of which form such vast masses over the basal series\r\nin the main Cordillera. On the other hand, in the Cordillera, we do not\r\nfind those endless varieties of indurated tuffs, with their numerous\r\nveins and concretionary arrangement, and those grit and mud stones, and\r\nsingular semi-porcellanic rocks, so abundant in the Uspallata range.\r\nThe submarine lavas, also, differ considerably; the feldspathic streams\r\nof the Cordillera contain much mica, which is absent in those of the\r\nUspallata range: in this latter range we have seen on how grand a\r\nscale, basaltic lava has been poured forth, of which there is not a\r\ntrace in the Cordillera. This dissimilarity is the more striking,\r\nconsidering that these two parallel chains are separated by a plain\r\nonly between ten and fifteen miles in width; and that the Uspallata\r\nlavas, as well as no doubt the alternating tufaceous beds, have\r\nproceeded from the west, from points apparently between the two ranges.\r\nTo imagine that these two piles of strata were contemporaneously\r\ndeposited in two closely adjoining, very deep, submarine areas,\r\nseparated from each other by a lofty ridge, where a plain now extends,\r\nwould be a gratuitous hypothesis. And had they been contemporaneously\r\ndeposited, without any such dividing ridge, surely some of the gypseous\r\nand other sedimentary matter forming such immensely thick masses in the\r\nCordillera, would have extended this short distance eastwards; and\r\nsurely some of the Uspallata tuffs and basalts also accumulated to so\r\ngreat a thickness, would have extended a little westward. Hence I\r\nconclude, that it is far from probable that these two series are not\r\ncontemporaneous; but that the strata of one of the chains were\r\ndeposited, and even the chain itself uplifted, before the formation of\r\nthe other:—which chain, then, is the oldest? Considering that in the\r\nUspallata range the lowest strata on the western flank lie\r\nunconformably on the clay- slate, as probably is the case with those on\r\nthe eastern flank, whereas in the Cordillera all the overlying strata\r\nlie conformably on this formation:—considering that in the Uspallata\r\nrange some of the beds, both low down and high up in the series, are\r\nmarked with vegetable impressions, showing the continued existence of\r\nneighbouring land;—considering the close general resemblance between\r\nthe deposits of this range and those of tertiary origin in several\r\nparts of the continent;—and lastly, even considering the lesser height\r\nand outlying position of the Uspallata range,—I conclude that the\r\nstrata composing it are in all probability of subsequent origin, and\r\nthat they were accumulated at a period when a deep sea studded with\r\nsubmarine volcanoes washed the eastern base of the already partially\r\nelevated Cordillera.\r\n\r\nThis conclusion is of much importance, for we have seen that in the\r\nCordillera, during the deposition of the Neocomian strata, the bed of\r\nthe sea must have subsided many thousand feet: we now learn that at a\r\nlater period an adjoining area first received a great accumulation of\r\nstrata, and was upheaved into land on which coniferous trees grew, and\r\nthat this area then subsided several thousand feet to receive the\r\nsuperincumbent submarine strata, afterwards being broken up, denuded,\r\nand elevated in mass to its present height. I am strengthened in this\r\nconclusion of there having been two distinct, great periods of\r\nsubsidence, by reflecting on the thick mass of coarse stratified\r\nconglomerate in the valley of Tenuyan, between the Peuquenes and\r\nPortillo lines; for the accumulation of this mass seems to me, as\r\npreviously remarked, almost necessarily to have required a prolonged\r\nsubsidence; and this subsidence, from the pebbles in the conglomerate\r\nhaving been to a great extent derived from the gypseous or Neocomian\r\nstrata of the Peuquenes line, we know must have been quite distinct\r\nfrom, and subsequent to, that sinking movement which probably\r\naccompanied the deposition of the Peuquenes strata, and which certainly\r\naccompanied the deposition of the equivalent beds near the Puente del\r\nInca, in this line of section.\r\n\r\nThe Uspallata chain corresponds in geographical position, though on a\r\nsmall scale, with the Portillo line; and its clay-slate formation is\r\nprobably the equivalent of the mica-schist of the Portillo, there\r\nmetamorphosed by the old white granites and syenites. The coloured beds\r\nunder the conglomerate in the valley of Tenuyan, of which traces are\r\nseen on the crest of the Portillo, and even the conglomerate itself,\r\nmay perhaps be synchronous with the tufaceous beds and submarine lavas\r\nof the Uspallata range; an open sea and volcanic action in the latter\r\ncase, and a confined channel between two bordering chains of islets in\r\nthe former case, having been sufficient to account for the\r\nmineralogical dissimilarity of the two series. From this correspondence\r\nbetween the Uspallata and Portillo ranges, perhaps in age and certainly\r\nin geographical position, one is tempted to consider the one range as\r\nthe prolongation of the other; but their axes are formed of totally\r\ndifferent intrusive rocks; and we have traced the apparent continuation\r\nof the red granite of the Portillo in the red porphyries diverging into\r\nthe main Cordillera. Whether the axis of the Uspallata range was\r\ninjected before, or as perhaps is more probable, after that of the\r\nPortillo line, I will not pretend to decide; but it is well to remember\r\nthat the highly inclined lava-streams on the eastern flank of the\r\nPortillo line, prove that its angular upheavement was not a single and\r\nsudden event; and therefore that the anticlinal elevation of the\r\nUspallata range may have been contemporaneous with some of the later\r\nangular movements by which the gigantic Portillo range gained its\r\npresent height above the adjoining plain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\nNORTHERN CHILE.

Near Coquimbo there is\r\nmuch hornblendic rock and various dusky-coloured porphyries. I will\r\ndescribe only one section in this district, namely, from near Illapel\r\nin a N.E. line to the mines of Los Hornos, and thence in a north by\r\neast direction to Combarbala, at the foot of the main Cordillera.\r\n\r\nNear Illapel, after passing for some distance over granite, andesite,\r\nand andesitic porphyry, we come to a greenish stratified feldspathic\r\nrock, which I believe is altered clay-slate, conformably capped by\r\nporphyries and porphyritic conglomerate of great thickness, dipping at\r\nan average angle of 20 degrees to N.E. by N. The uppermost beds consist\r\nof conglomerates and sandstone only a little metamorphosed, and\r\nconformably covered by a gypseous formation of very great thickness,\r\nbut much denuded. This gypseous formation, where first met with, lies\r\nin a broad valley or basin, a little southward of the mines of Los\r\nHornos: the lower half alone contains gypsum, not in great masses as in\r\nthe Cordillera, but in innumerable thin layers, seldom more than an\r\ninch or two in thickness. The gypsum is either opaque or transparent,\r\nand is associated with carbonate of lime. The layers alternate with\r\nnumerous varying ones of a calcareous clay-shale (with strong aluminous\r\nodour, adhering to the tongue, easily fusible into a pale green glass),\r\nmore or less indurated, either earthy and cream-coloured, or greenish\r\nand hard. The more indurated varieties have a compact, homogeneous,\r\nalmost crystalline fracture, and contain granules of crystallised oxide\r\nof iron. Some of the varieties almost resemble honestones. There is\r\nalso a little black, hardly fusible, siliceo- calcareous clay-slate,\r\nlike some of the varieties alternating with gypsum on the Peuquenes\r\nrange.\r\n\r\nThe upper half of this gypseous formation is mainly formed of the same\r\ncalcareous clay-shale rock, but without any gypsum, and varying\r\nextremely in nature: it passes from a soft, coarse, earthy, ferruginous\r\nstate, including particles of quartz, into compact claystones with\r\ncrystallised oxide of iron,—into porcellanic layers, alternating with\r\nseams of calcareous matter,—and into green porcelain-jasper,\r\nexcessively hard, but easily fusible. Strata of this nature alternate\r\nwith much black and brown siliceo-calcareous slate, remarkable from the\r\nwonderful number of huge embedded logs of silicified wood. This wood,\r\naccording to Mr. R. Brown, is (judging from several specimens) all\r\nconiferous. Some of the layers of the black siliceous slate contained\r\nirregular angular fragments of imperfect pitchstone, which I believe,\r\nas in the Uspallata range, has originated in a metamorphic process.\r\nThere was one bed of a marly tufaceous nature, and of little specific\r\ngravity. Veins of agate and calcareous spar are numerous. The whole of\r\nthis gypseous formation, especially the upper half, has been injected,\r\nmetamorphosed, and locally contorted by numerous hillocks of intrusive\r\nporphyries crowded together in an extraordinary manner. These hillocks\r\nconsist of purple claystone and of various other porphyries, and of\r\nmuch white feldspathic greenstone passing into andesite; this latter\r\nvariety included in one case crystals of orthitic and albitic feldspar\r\ntouching each other, and others of hornblende, chlorite, and epidote.\r\nThe strata surrounding these intrusive hillocks at the mines of Los\r\nHornos, are intersected by many veins of copper-pyrites, associated\r\nwith much micaceous iron-ore, and by some of gold: in the neighbourhood\r\nof these veins the rocks are blackened and much altered. The gypsum\r\nnear the intrusive masses is always opaque. One of these hillocks of\r\nporphyry was capped by some stratified porphyritic conglomerate, which\r\nmust have been brought up from below, through the whole immense\r\nthickness of the overlying gypseous formation. The lower beds of the\r\ngypseous formation resemble the corresponding and probably\r\ncontemporaneous strata of the main Cordillera; whilst the upper beds in\r\nseveral respects resemble those of the Uspallata chain, and possibly\r\nmay be contemporaneous with them; for I have endeavoured to show that\r\nthe Uspallata beds were accumulated subsequently to the gypseous or\r\nNeocomian formations of the Cordillera.\r\n\r\nThis pile of strata dips at an angle of about 20 degrees to N.E. by N.,\r\nclose up to the foot of the Cuesta de Los Hornos, a crooked range of\r\nmountains formed of intrusive rocks of the same nature with the above\r\ndescribed hillocks. Only in one or two places, on this south-eastern\r\nside of the range, I noticed a narrow fringe of the upper gypseous\r\nstrata brushed up and inclined south-eastward from it. On its\r\nnorth-eastern flank, and likewise on a few of the summits, the\r\nstratified porphyritic conglomerate is inclined N.E.: so that, if we\r\ndisregard the very narrow anticlinal fringe of gypseous strata at its\r\nS.E. foot, this range forms a second uniclinal axis of elevation.\r\nProceeding in a north-by-east direction to the village of Combarbala,\r\nwe come to a third escarpment of the porphyritic conglomerate, dipping\r\neastwards, and forming the outer range of the main Cordillera. The\r\nlower beds were here more jaspery than usual, and they included some\r\nwhite cherty strata and red sandstones, alternating with purple\r\nclaystone porphyry. Higher up in the Cordillera there appeared to be a\r\nline of andesitic rocks; and beyond them, a fourth escarpment of the\r\nporphyritic conglomerate, again dipping eastwards or inwards. The\r\noverlying gypseous strata, if they ever existed here, have been\r\nentirely removed.\r\n\r\nCOPPER MINES OF PANUNCILLO.\r\n\r\nFrom Combarbala to Coquimbo, I traversed the country in a zigzag\r\ndirection, crossing and recrossing the porphyritic conglomerate and\r\nfinding in the granitic districts an unusual number of mountain-masses\r\ncomposed of various intrusive, porphyritic rocks, many of them\r\nandesitic. One common variety was greenish-black, with large crystals\r\nof blackish albite. At Panuncillo a short N.N.W. and S.S.E. ridge, with\r\na nucleus formed of greenstone and of a slate-coloured porphyry\r\nincluding crystals of glassy feldspar, deserves notice, from the very\r\nsingular nature of the almost vertical strata composing it. These\r\nconsist chiefly of a finer and coarser granular mixture, not very\r\ncompact, of white carbonate of lime, of protoxide of iron and of\r\nyellowish garnets (ascertained by Professor Miller), each grain being\r\nan almost perfect crystal. Some of the varieties consist exclusively of\r\ngranules of the calcareous spar; and some contain grains of copper ore,\r\nand, I believe, of quartz. These strata alternate with a bluish,\r\ncompact, fusible, feldspathic rock. Much of the above granular mixture\r\nhas, also, a pseudo-brecciated structure, in which fragments are\r\nobscurely arranged in planes parallel to those of the stratification,\r\nand are conspicuous on the weathered surfaces. The fragments are\r\nangular or rounded, small or large, and consist of bluish or reddish\r\ncompact feldspathic matter, in which a few acicular crystals of\r\nfeldspar can sometimes be seen. The fragments often blend at their\r\nedges into the surrounding granular mass, and seem due to a kind of\r\nconcretionary action.\r\n\r\nThese singular rocks are traversed by many copper veins, and appear to\r\nrest conformably on the granular mixture (in parts as fine-grained as a\r\nsandstone) of quartz, mica, hornblende, and feldspar; and this on fine-\r\ngrained, common gneiss; and this on a laminated mass, composed of\r\npinkish ORTHITIC feldspar, including a few specks of hornblende; and\r\nlastly, this on granite, which together with andesitic rocks, form the\r\nsurrounding district.\r\n\r\nCOQUIMBO: MINING DISTRICT OF ARQUEROS.\r\n\r\nAt Coquimbo the porphyritic conglomerate formation approaches nearer to\r\nthe Pacific than in any other part of Chile visited by me, being\r\nseparated from the coast by a tract only a few miles broad of the usual\r\nplutonic rocks, with the addition of a porphyry having a red euritic\r\nbase. In proceeding to the mines of Arqueros, the strata of porphyritic\r\nconglomerate are at first nearly horizontal, an unusual circumstance,\r\nand afterwards they dip gently to S.S.E. After having ascended to a\r\nconsiderable height, we come to an undulatory district in which the\r\nfamous silver mines are situated; my examination was chiefly confined\r\nto those of S. Rosa. Most of the rocks in this district are stratified,\r\ndipping in various directions, and many of them are of so singular a\r\nnature, that at the risk of being tedious I must briefly describe them.\r\nThe commonest variety is a dull-red, compact, finely brecciated stone,\r\ncontaining much iron and innumerable white crystallised particles of\r\ncarbonate of lime, and minute extraneous fragments. Another variety is\r\nalmost equally common near S. Rosa; it has a bright green, scanty\r\nbasis, including distinct crystals and patches of white carbonate of\r\nlime, and grains of red, semi-micaceous oxide of iron; in parts the\r\nbasis becomes dark green, and assumes an obscure crystalline\r\narrangement, and occasionally in parts it becomes soft and slightly\r\ntranslucent like soapstone. These red and green rocks are often quite\r\ndistinct, and often pass into each other; the passage being sometimes\r\naffected by a fine brecciated structure, particles of the red and green\r\nmatter being mingled together. Some of the varieties appear gradually\r\nto become porphyritic with feldspar; and all of them are easily fusible\r\ninto pale or dark-coloured beads, strongly attracted by the magnet. I\r\nshould perhaps have mistaken several of these stratified rocks for\r\nsubmarine lavas, like some of those described at the Puente del Inca,\r\nhad I not examined, a few leagues eastward of this point, a fine series\r\nof analogous but less metamorphosed, sedimentary beds belonging to the\r\ngypseous formation, and probably derived from a volcanic source.\r\n\r\nThis formation is intersected by numerous metalliferous veins, running,\r\nthough irregularly, N.W. and S.E., and generally at right angles to the\r\nmany dikes. The veins consist of native silver, of muriate of silver,\r\nan amalgam of silver, cobalt, antimony, and arsenic, generally embedded\r\nin sulphate of barytes. (See the Report on M. Domeyko’s account of\r\nthose mines, in the “Comptes Rendus” tome 14 page 560.) I was assured\r\nby Mr. Lambert, that native copper without a trace of silver has been\r\nfound in the same vein with native silver without a trace of copper. At\r\nthe mines of Aristeas, the silver veins are said to be unproductive as\r\nsoon as they pass into the green strata, whereas at S. Rosa, only two\r\nor three miles distant, the reverse happens; and at the time of my\r\nvisit, the miners were working through a red stratum, in the hope of\r\nthe vein becoming productive in the underlying green sedimentary mass.\r\nI have a specimen of one of these green rocks, with the usual granules\r\nof white calcareous spar and red oxide of iron, abounding with\r\ndisseminated particles of glittering native and muriate of silver, yet\r\ntaken at the distance of one yard from any vein,—a circumstance, as I\r\nwas assured, of very rare occurrence.\r\n\r\nA SECTION EASTWARD, UP THE VALLEY OF COQUIMBO.\r\n\r\nAfter passing for a few miles over the coast granitic series, we come\r\nto the porphyritic conglomerate, with its usual characters, and with\r\nsome of the beds distinctly displaying their mechanical origin. The\r\nstrata, where first met with, are, as before stated, only slightly\r\ninclined; but near the Hacienda of Pluclaro, we come to an anticlinal\r\naxis, with the beds much dislocated and shifted by a great fault, of\r\nwhich not a trace is externally seen in the outline of the hill. I\r\nbelieve that this anticlinal axis can be traced northwards, into the\r\ndistrict of Arqueros, where a conspicuous hill called Cerro Blanco,\r\nformed of a harsh, cream-coloured euritic rock, including a few\r\ncrystals of reddish feldspar, and associated with some purplish\r\nclaystone porphyry, seems to fall on a line of elevation. In descending\r\nfrom the Arqueros district, I crossed on the northern border of the\r\nvalley, strata inclined eastward from the Pluclaro axis: on the\r\nporphyritic conglomerate there rested a mass, some hundred feet thick,\r\nof brown argillaceous limestone, in parts crystalline, and in parts\r\nalmost composed of Hippurites Chilensis, d’Orbigny; above this came a\r\nblack calcareous shale, and on it a red conglomerate. In the brown\r\nlimestone, with the Hippurites, there was an impression of a Pecten and\r\na coral, and great numbers of a large Gryphaea, very like, and,\r\naccording to Professor E. Forbes, probably identical with G.\r\nOrientalis, Forbes MS.,—a cretaceous species (probably upper greensand)\r\nfrom Verdachellum, in Southern India. These fossils seem to occupy\r\nnearly the same position with those at the Puente del Inca,—namely, at\r\nthe top of the porphyritic conglomerate, and at the base of the\r\ngypseous formation.\r\n\r\nA little above the Hacienda of Pluclaro, I made a detour on the\r\nnorthern side of the valley, to examine the superincumbent gypseous\r\nstrata, which I estimated at 6,000 feet in thickness. The uppermost\r\nbeds of the porphyritic conglomerate, on which the gypseous strata\r\nconformably rest, are variously coloured, with one very singular and\r\nbeautiful stratum composed of purple pebbles of various kinds of\r\nporphyry, embedded in white calcareous spar, including cavities lined\r\nwith bright-green crystallised epidote. The whole pile of strata\r\nbelonging to both formations is inclined, apparently from the\r\nabove-mentioned axis of Pluclaro, at an angle of between 20 and 30\r\ndegrees to the east. I will here give a section of the principal beds\r\nmet with in crossing the entire thickness of the gypseous strata.\r\n\r\nFirstly: above the porphyritic conglomerate formation, there is a fine-\r\ngrained, red, crystalline sandstone.\r\n\r\nSecondly: a thick mass of smooth-grained, calcareo-aluminous, shaly\r\nrock, often marked with dendritic manganese, and having, where most\r\ncompact, the external appearance of honestone. It is easily fusible. I\r\nshall for the future, for convenience’ sake, call this variety\r\npseudo-honestone. Some of the varieties are quite black when freshly\r\nbroken, but all weather into a yellowish-ash coloured, soft, earthy\r\nsubstance, precisely as is the case with the compact shaly rocks of the\r\nPeuquenes range. This stratum is of the same general nature with many\r\nof the beds near Los Hornos in the Illapel section. In this second bed,\r\nor in the underlying red sandstone (for the surface was partially\r\nconcealed by detritus), there was a thick mass of gypsum, having the\r\nsame mineralogical characters with the great beds described in our\r\nsections across the Cordillera.\r\n\r\nThirdly: a thick stratum of fine-grained, red, sedimentary matter,\r\neasily fusible into a white glass, like the basis of claystone\r\nporphyry; but in parts jaspery, in parts brecciated, and including\r\ncrystalline specks of carbonate of lime. In some of the jaspery layers,\r\nand in some of the black siliceous slaty bands, there were irregular\r\nseams of imperfect pitchstone, undoubtedly of metamorphic origin, and\r\nother seams of brown, crystalline limestone. Here, also, were masses,\r\nexternally resembling ill-preserved silicified wood.\r\n\r\nFourthly and fifthly: calcareous pseudo-honestone; and a thick stratum\r\nconcealed by detritus.\r\n\r\nSixthly: a thinly stratified mass of bright green, compact,\r\nsmooth-grained, calcareo-argillaceous stone, easily fusible, and\r\nemitting a strong aluminous odour: the whole has a highly\r\nangulo-concretionary structure; and it resembles, to a certain extent,\r\nsome of the upper tufaceo-infusorial deposits of the Patagonian\r\ntertiary formation. It is in its nature allied to our pseudo-honestone,\r\nand it includes well characterised layers of that variety; and other\r\nlayers of a pale green, harder, and brecciated variety; and others of\r\nred sedimentary matter, like that of bed Three. Some pebbles of\r\nporphyries are embedded in the upper part.\r\n\r\nSeventhly: red sedimentary matter or sandstone like that of bed One,\r\nseveral hundred feet in thickness, and including jaspery layers, often\r\nhaving a finely brecciated structure.\r\n\r\nEighthly: white, much indurated, almost crystalline tuff, several\r\nhundred feet in thickness, including rounded grains of quartz and\r\nparticles of green matter like that of bed Six. Parts pass into a very\r\npale green, semi- porcellanic stone.\r\n\r\nNinthly: red or brown coarse conglomerate, three or four hundred feet\r\nthick, formed chiefly of pebbles of porphyries, with volcanic\r\nparticles, in an arenaceous, non-calcareous, fusible basis: the upper\r\ntwo feet are arenaceous without any pebbles.\r\n\r\nTenthly: the last and uppermost stratum here exhibited, is a compact,\r\nslate-coloured porphyry, with numerous elongated crystals of glassy\r\nfeldspar, from one hundred and fifty to two hundred feet in thickness;\r\nit lies strictly conformably on the underlying conglomerate, and is\r\nundoubtedly a submarine lava.\r\n\r\nThis great pile of strata has been broken up in several places by\r\nintrusive hillocks of purple claystone porphyry, and by dikes of\r\nporphyritic greenstone: it is said that a few poor metalliferous veins\r\nhave been discovered here. From the fusible nature and general\r\nappearance of the finer-grained strata, they probably owe their origin\r\n(like the allied beds of the Uspallata range, and of the Upper\r\nPatagonian tertiary formations), to gentle volcanic eruptions, and to\r\nthe abrasion of volcanic rocks. Comparing these beds with those in the\r\nmining district of Arqueros, we see at both places rocks easily\r\nfusible, of the same peculiar bright green and red colours, containing\r\ncalcareous matter, often having a finely brecciated structure, often\r\npassing into each other, and often alternating together: hence I cannot\r\ndoubt that the only difference between them, lies in the Arqueros beds\r\nhaving been more metamorphosed (in conformity with their more\r\ndislocated and injected condition), and consequently in the calcareous\r\nmatter, oxide of iron and green colouring matter, having been\r\nsegregated under a more crystalline form.\r\n\r\nThe strata are inclined, as before stated, from 20 to 30 degrees\r\neastward, towards an irregular north and south chain of andesitic\r\nporphyry and of porphyritic greenstone, where they are abruptly cut\r\noff. In the valley of Coquimbo, near to the H. of Gualliguaca, similar\r\nplutonic rocks are met with, apparently a southern prolongation of the\r\nabove chain; and eastward of it we have an escarpment of the\r\nporphyritic conglomerate, with the strata inclined at a small angle\r\neastward, which makes the third escarpment, including that nearest the\r\ncoast. Proceeding up the valley we come to another north and south line\r\nof granite, andesite, and blackish porphyry, which seem to lie in an\r\nirregular trough of the porphyritic conglomerate. Again, on the south\r\nside of the R. Claro, there are some irregular granitic hills, which\r\nhave thrown off the strata of porphyritic conglomerate to the N.W. by\r\nW.; but the stratification here has been much disturbed. I did not\r\nproceed any farther up the valley, and this point is about two-thirds\r\nof the distance between the Pacific and the main Cordillera.\r\n\r\nI will describe only one other section, namely, on the north side of\r\nthe R. Claro, which is interesting from containing fossils: the strata\r\nare much dislocated by faults and dikes, and are inclined to the north,\r\ntowards a mountain of andesite and porphyry, into which they appear to\r\nbecome almost blended. As the beds approach this mountain, their\r\ninclination increases up to an angle of 70 degrees, and in the upper\r\npart, the rocks become highly metamorphosed. The lowest bed visible in\r\nthis section, is a purplish hard sandstone. Secondly, a bed two or\r\nthree hundred feet thick, of a white siliceous sandstone, with a\r\ncalcareous cement, containing seams of slaty sandstone, and of hard\r\nyellowish-brown (dolomitic?) limestone; numerous, well-rounded, little\r\npebbles of quartz are included in the sandstone. Thirdly, a dark\r\ncoloured limestone with some quartz pebbles, from fifty to sixty feet\r\nin thickness, containing numerous silicified shells, presently to be\r\nenumerated. Fourthly, very compact, calcareous, jaspery sandstone,\r\npassing into (fifthly) a great bed, several hundred feet thick, of\r\nconglomerate, composed of pebbles of white, red, and purple porphyries,\r\nof sandstone and quartz, cemented by calcareous matter. I observed that\r\nsome of the finer parts of this conglomerate were much indurated within\r\na foot of a dike eight feet in width, and were rendered of a paler\r\ncolour with the calcareous matter segregated into white crystallised\r\nparticles; some parts were stained green from the colouring matter of\r\nthe dike. Sixthly, a thick mass, obscurely stratified, of a red\r\nsedimentary stone or sandstone, full of crystalline calcareous matter,\r\nimperfect crystals of oxide of iron, and I believe of feldspar, and\r\ntherefore closely resembling some of the highly metamorphosed beds at\r\nArqueros: this bed was capped by, and appeared to pass in its upper\r\npart into, rocks similarly coloured, containing calcareous matter, and\r\nabounding with minute crystals, mostly elongated and glassy, of reddish\r\nalbite. Seventhly, a conformable stratum of fine reddish porphyry with\r\nlarge crystals of (albitic?) feldspar; probably a submarine lava.\r\nEighthly, another conformable bed of green porphyry, with specks of\r\ngreen earth and cream-coloured crystals of feldspar. I believe that\r\nthere are other superincumbent crystalline strata and submarine lavas,\r\nbut I had not time to examine them.\r\n\r\nThe upper beds in this section probably correspond with parts of the\r\ngreat gypseous formation; and the lower beds of red sandstone\r\nconglomerate and fossiliferous limestone no doubt are the equivalents\r\nof the Hippurite stratum, seen in descending from Arqueros to Pluclaro,\r\nwhich there lies conformably upon the porphyritic conglomerate\r\nformation. The fossils found in the third bed, consist of:—\r\n\r\nPecten Dufreynoyi, d’Orbigny, “Voyage, Part Pal.” This species, which\r\noccurs here in vast numbers, according to M. D’Orbigny, resembles\r\ncertain cretaceous forms.\r\n\r\nOstrea hemispherica, d’Orbigny, “Voyage” etc.\r\n\r\nAlso resembles, according to the same author, cretaceous forms.\r\n\r\nTerebratula aenigma, d’Orbigny, “Voyage” etc. (Pl. 22 Figures 10-12.)\r\n\r\nIs allied, according to M. d’Orbigny, to T. concinna from the Forest\r\nMarble. A series of this species, collected in several localities\r\nhereafter to be referred to, has been laid before Professor Forbes; and\r\nhe informs me that many of the specimens are almost undistinguishable\r\nfrom our oolitic T. tetraedra, and that the varieties amongst them are\r\nsuch as are found in that variable species. Generally speaking, the\r\nAmerican specimens of T. aenigma may be distinguished from the British\r\nT. tetraedra, by the surface having the ribs sharp and well-defined to\r\nthe beak, whilst in the British species they become obsolete and\r\nsmoothed down; but this difference is not constant. Professor Forbes\r\nadds, that, possibly, internal characters may exist, which would\r\ndistinguish the American species from its European allies.\r\n\r\nSpirifer linguiferoides, E. Forbes.\r\n\r\nProfessor Forbes states that this species is very near to S. linguifera\r\nof Phillips (a carboniferous limestone fossil), but probably distinct.\r\nM. d’Orbigny considers it as perhaps indicating the Jurassic period.\r\n\r\nAmmonites, imperfect impression of.\r\n\r\nM. Domeyko has sent to France a collection of fossils, which, I\r\npresume, from the description given, must have come from the\r\nneighbourhood of Arqueros; they consist of:—\r\n\r\nPecten Dufreynoyi, d’Orbigny, “Voyage” Part Pal. Ostrea hemispherica,\r\nd’Orbigny, “Voyage” Part Pal. Turritella Andii, d’Orbigny, “Voyage”\r\nPart Pal. (Pleurotomaria Humboldtii of Von Buch). Hippurites Chilensis,\r\nd’Orbigny, “Voyage” Part Pal.\r\n\r\nThe specimens of this Hippurite, as well as those I collected in my\r\ndescent from Arqueros, are very imperfect; but in M. d’Orbigny’s\r\nopinion they resemble, as does the Turritella Andii, cretaceous (upper\r\ngreensand) forms.\r\n\r\nNautilus Domeykus, d’Orbigny, “Voyage” Part Pal. Terebratula aenigma,\r\nd’Orbigny, “Voyage” Part Pal. Terebratula ignaciana, d’Orbigny,\r\n“Voyage” Part Pal.\r\n\r\nThis latter species was found by M. Domeyko in the same block of\r\nlimestone with the T. aenigma. According to M. d’Orbigny, it comes near\r\nto T. ornithocephala from the Lias. A series of this species collected\r\nat Guasco, has been examined by Professor E. Forbes, and he states that\r\nit is difficult to distinguish between some of the specimens and the T.\r\nhastata from the mountain limestone; and that it is equally difficult\r\nto draw a line between them and some Marlstone Terebratulae. Without a\r\nknowledge of the internal structure, it is impossible at present to\r\ndecide on their identity with analogous European forms.\r\n\r\nThe remarks given on the several foregoing shells, show that, in M.\r\nd’Orbigny’s opinion, the Pecten, Ostrea, Turritella, and Hippurite\r\nindicate the cretaceous period; and the Gryphaea appears to Professor\r\nForbes to be identical with a species, associated in Southern India\r\nwith unquestionably cretaceous forms. On the other hand, the two\r\nTerebratulae and the Spirifer point, in the opinion both of M.\r\nd’Orbigny and Professor Forbes, to the oolitic series. Hence M.\r\nd’Orbigny, not having himself examined this country, has concluded that\r\nthere are here two distinct formations; but the Spirifer and T. aenigma\r\nwere certainly included in the same bed with the Pecten and Ostrea,\r\nwhence I extracted them; and the geologist M. Domeyko sent home the two\r\nTerebratulae with the other-named shells, from the same locality,\r\nwithout specifying that they came from different beds. Again, as we\r\nshall presently see, in a collection of shells given me from Guasco,\r\nthe same species, and others presenting analogous differences, are\r\nmingled together, and are in the same condition; and lastly, in three\r\nplaces in the valley of Copiapo, I found some of these same species\r\nsimilarly grouped. Hence there cannot be any doubt, highly curious\r\nthough the fact be, that these several fossils, namely, the Hippurites,\r\nGryphaea, Ostrea, Pecten, Turritella, Nautilus, two Terebratulae, and\r\nSpirifer all belong to the same formation, which would appear to form a\r\npassage between the oolitic and cretaceous systems of Europe. Although\r\naware how unusual the term must sound, I shall, for convenience’ sake,\r\ncall this formation cretaceo- oolitic. Comparing the sections in this\r\nvalley of Coquimbo with those in the Cordillera described in the last\r\nchapter, and bearing in mind the character of the beds in the\r\nintermediate district of Los Hornos, there is certainly a close general\r\nmineralogical resemblance between them, both in the underlying\r\nporphyritic conglomerate, and in the overlying gypseous formation.\r\nConsidering this resemblance, and that the fossils from the Puente del\r\nInca at the base of the gypseous formation, and throughout the greater\r\npart of its entire thickness on the Peuquenes range, indicate the\r\nNeocomian period,—that is, the dawn of the cretaceous system, or, as\r\nsome have believed, a passage between this latter and the oolitic\r\nseries—I conclude that probably the gypseous and associated beds in all\r\nthe sections hitherto described, belong to the same great formation,\r\nwhich I have denominated—cretaceo-oolitic. I may add, before leaving\r\nCoquimbo, that M. Gay found in the neighbouring Cordillera, at the\r\nheight of 14,000 feet above the sea, a fossiliferous formation,\r\nincluding a Trigonia and Pholadomya (D’Orbigny “Voyage” Part Geolog.\r\npage 242.);—both of which genera occur at the Puente del Inca.\r\n\r\nCOQUIMBO TO GUASCO.\r\n\r\nThe rocks near the coast, and some way inland, do not differ from those\r\ndescribed northwards of Valparaiso: we have much greenstone, syenite,\r\nfeldspathic and jaspery slate, and grauwackes having a basis like that\r\nof claystone; there are some large tracts of granite, in which the\r\nconstituent minerals are sometimes arranged in folia, thus composing an\r\nimperfect gneiss. There are two large districts of mica-schists,\r\npassing into glossy clay-slate, and resembling the great formation in\r\nthe Chonos Archipelago. In the valley of Guasco, an escarpment of\r\nporphyritic conglomerate is first seen high up the valley, about two\r\nleagues eastward of the town of Ballenar. I heard of a great gypseous\r\nformation in the Cordillera; and a collection of shells made there was\r\ngiven me. These shells are all in the same condition, and appear to\r\nhave come from the same bed: they consist of:—\r\n\r\nTurritella Andii, d’Orbigny, “Voyage” Part Pal. Pecten Dufreynoyi,\r\nd’Orbigny, “Voyage” Part Pal. Terebatula ignaciana, d’Orbigny, “Voyage”\r\nPart Pal.\r\n\r\nThe relations of these species have been given under the head of\r\nCoquimbo.\r\n\r\nTerebratula aenigma, d’Orbigny, “Voyage” Part Pal.\r\n\r\nThis shell M. d’Orbigny does not consider identical with his T.\r\naenigma, but near to T. obsoleta. Professor Forbes thinks that it is\r\ncertainly a variety of T. aenigma: we shall meet with this variety\r\nagain at Copiapo.\r\n\r\nSpirifer Chilensis, E. Forbes.\r\n\r\nProfessor Forbes remarks that this fossil resembles several\r\ncarboniferous limestone Spirifers; and that it is also related to some\r\nliassic species, as S. Wolcotii.\r\n\r\nIf these shells had been examined independently of the other\r\ncollections, they would probably have been considered, from the\r\ncharacters of the two Terebratulae, and from the Spirifer, as oolitic;\r\nbut considering that the first species, and according to Professor\r\nForbes, the four first, are identical with those from Coquimbo, the two\r\nformations no doubt are the same, and may, as I have said, be\r\nprovisionally called cretaceo-oolitic.\r\n\r\nVALLEY OF COPIAPO.\r\n\r\nThe journey from Guasco to Copiapo, owing to the utterly desert nature\r\nof the country, was necessarily so hurried, that I do not consider my\r\nnotes worth giving. In the valley of Copiapo some of the sections are\r\nvery interesting. From the sea to the town of Copiapo, a distance\r\nestimated at thirty miles, the mountains are composed of greenstone,\r\ngranite, andesite, and blackish porphyry, together with some\r\ndusky-green feldspathic rocks, which I believe to be altered\r\nclay-slate: these mountains are crossed by many brown-coloured dikes,\r\nrunning north and south. Above the town, the main valley runs in a\r\nsouth-east and even more southerly course towards the Cordillera, where\r\nit is divided into three great ravines, by the northern one of which,\r\ncalled Jolquera, I penetrated for a short distance. The section,\r\nSection 1/3 in Plate 1, gives an eye-sketch of the structure and\r\ncomposition of the mountains on both sides of this valley: a straight\r\neast and west line from the town to the Cordillera is perhaps not more\r\nthan thirty miles, but along the valley the distance is much greater.\r\nWherever the valley trended very southerly, I have endeavoured to\r\ncontract the section into its true proportion. This valley, I may add,\r\nrises much more gently than any other valley which I saw in Chile.\r\n\r\nTo commence with our section, for a short distance above the town we\r\nhave hills of the granitic series, together with some of that rock [A],\r\nwhich I suspect to be altered clay-slate, but which Professor G. Rose,\r\njudging from specimens collected by Meyen at P. Negro, states is\r\nserpentine passing into greenstone. We then come suddenly to the great\r\ngypseous formation [B], without having passed over, differently from,\r\nin all the sections hitherto described, any of the porphyritic\r\nconglomerate. The strata are at first either horizontal or gently\r\ninclined westward; then highly inclined in various directions, and\r\ncontorted by underlying masses of intrusive rocks; and lastly, they\r\nhave a regular eastward dip, and form a tolerably well pronounced north\r\nand south line of hills. This formation consists of thin strata, with\r\ninnumerable alternations, of black, calcareous slate-rock, of\r\ncalcareo-aluminous stones like those at Coquimbo, which I have called\r\npseudo-honestones of green jaspery layers, and of pale-purplish,\r\ncalcareous, soft rotten-stone, including seams and veins of gypsum.\r\nThese strata are conformably overlaid by a great thickness of thinly\r\nstratified, compact limestone with included crystals of carbonate of\r\nlime. At a place called Tierra Amarilla, at the foot of a mountain thus\r\ncomposed there is a broad vein, or perhaps stratum, of a beautiful and\r\ncurious crystallised mixture, composed, according to Professor G. Rose,\r\nof sulphate of iron under two forms, and of the sulphates of copper and\r\nalumina (Meyen’s “Reise” etc. Th. 1, s. 394.): the section is so\r\nobscure that I could not make out whether this vein or stratum occurred\r\nin the gypseous formation, or more probably in some underlying masses\r\n[A], which I believe are altered clay-slate.\r\n\r\nSECOND AXIS OF ELEVATION.\r\n\r\nAfter the gypseous masses [B], we come to a line of hills of\r\nunstratified porphyry [C], which on their eastern side blend into\r\nstrata of great thickness of porphyritic conglomerate, dipping\r\neastward. This latter formation, however, here has not been nearly so\r\nmuch metamorphosed as in most parts of Central Chile; it is composed of\r\nbeds of true purple claystone porphyry, repeatedly alternating with\r\nthick beds of purplish-red conglomerate with the well-rounded, large\r\npebbles of various porphyries, not blended together.\r\n\r\nTHIRD AXIS OF ELEVATION.\r\n\r\nNear the ravine of Los Hornitos, there is a well-marked line of\r\nelevation, extending for many miles in a N.N.E. and S.S.W. direction,\r\nwith the strata dipping in most parts (as in the second axis) only in\r\none direction, namely, eastward at an average angle of between 30 and\r\n40 degrees. Close to the mouth of the valley, however, there is, as\r\nrepresented in the section, a steep and high mountain [D], composed of\r\nvarious green and brown intrusive porphyries enveloped with strata,\r\napparently belonging to the upper parts of the porphyritic\r\nconglomerate, and dipping both eastward and westward. I will describe\r\nthe section seen on the eastern side of this mountain [D], beginning at\r\nthe base with the lowest bed visible in the porphyritic conglomerate,\r\nand proceeding upwards through the gypseous formation. Bed 1 consists\r\nof reddish and brownish porphyry varying in character, and in many\r\nparts highly amygdaloidal with carbonate of lime, and with bright green\r\nand brown bole. Its upper surface is throughout clearly defined, but\r\nthe lower surface is in most parts indistinct, and towards the summit\r\nof the mountain [D] quite blended into the intrusive porphyries. Bed 2,\r\na pale lilac, hard but not heavy stone, slightly laminated, including\r\nsmall extraneous fragments, and imperfect as well as some perfect and\r\nglassy crystals of feldspar; from one hundred and fifty to two hundred\r\nfeet in thickness. When examining it in situ, I thought it was\r\ncertainly a true porphyry, but my specimens now lead me to suspect that\r\nit possibly may be a metamorphosed tuff. From its colour it could be\r\ntraced for a long distance, overlying in one part, quite conformably to\r\nthe porphyry of bed 1, and in another not distant part, a very thick\r\nmass of conglomerate, composed of pebbles of a porphyry chiefly like\r\nthat of bed 1: this fact shows how the nature of the bottom formerly\r\nvaried in short horizontal distances. Bed 3, white, much indurated\r\ntuff, containing minute pebbles, broken crystals, and scales of mica,\r\nvaries much in thickness. This bed is remarkable from containing many\r\nglobular and pear-shaped, externally rusty balls, from the size of an\r\napple to a man’s head, of very tough, slate-coloured porphyry, with\r\nimperfect crystals of feldspar: in shape these balls do not resemble\r\npebbles, AND I BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE SUBAQUEOUS VOLCANIC BOMBS; they\r\ndiffer from SUBAERIAL bombs only in not being vesicular. Bed 4; a dull\r\npurplish-red, hard conglomerate, with crystallised particles and veins\r\nof carbonate of lime, from three hundred to four hundred feet in\r\nthickness. The pebbles are of claystone porphyries of many varieties;\r\nthey are tolerably well rounded, and vary in size from a large apple to\r\na man’s head. This bed includes three layers of coarse, black,\r\ncalcareous, somewhat slaty rock: the upper part passes into a compact\r\nred sandstone.\r\n\r\nIn a formation so highly variable in mineralogical nature, any division\r\nnot founded on fossil remains, must be extremely arbitrary:\r\nnevertheless, the beds below the last conglomerate may, in accordance\r\nwith all the sections hitherto described, be considered as belonging to\r\nthe porphyritic conglomerate, and those above it to the gypseous\r\nformation, marked [E] in the section. The part of the valley in which\r\nthe following beds are seen is near Potrero Seco. Bed 5, compact,\r\nfine-grained, pale greenish-grey, non- calcareous, indurated mudstone,\r\neasily fusible into a pale green and white glass. Bed 6, purplish,\r\ncoarse-grained, hard sandstone, with broken crystals of feldspar and\r\ncrystallised particles of carbonate of lime; it possesses a slightly\r\nnodular structure. Bed 7, blackish-grey, much indurated, calcareous\r\nmudstone, with extraneous particles of unequal size; the whole being in\r\nparts finely brecciated. In this mass there is a stratum, twenty feet\r\nin thickness, of impure gypsum. Bed 8, a greenish mudstone, with\r\nseveral layers of gypsum. Bed 9, a highly indurated, easily fusible,\r\nwhite tuff, thickly mottled with ferruginous matter, and including some\r\nwhite semi-porcellanic layers, which are interlaced with ferruginous\r\nveins. This stone closely resembles some of the commonest varieties in\r\nthe Uspallata chain. Bed 10, a thick bed of rather bright green,\r\nindurated mudstone or tuff, with a concretionary nodular structure so\r\nstrongly developed that the whole mass consists of balls. I will not\r\nattempt to estimate the thickness of the strata in the gypseous\r\nformation hitherto described, but it must certainly be very many\r\nhundred feet. Bed 11 is at least 800 feet in thickness: it consists of\r\nthin layers of whitish, greenish, or more commonly brown, fine-grained,\r\nindurated tuffs, which crumble into angular fragments: some of the\r\nlayers are semi-porcellanic, many of them highly ferruginous, and some\r\nare almost composed of carbonate of lime and iron with drusy cavities\r\nlined with quartzf-crystals. Bed 12, dull purplish or greenish or\r\ndark-grey, very compact and much indurated mudstone: estimated at 1,500\r\nfeet in thickness: in some parts this rock assumes the character of an\r\nimperfect coarse clay-slate; but viewed under a lens, the basis always\r\nhas a mottled appearance, with the edges of the minute component\r\nparticles blending together. Parts are calcareous, and there are\r\nnumerous veins of highly crystalline carbonate of lime charged with\r\niron. The mass has a nodular structure, and is divided by only a few\r\nplanes of stratification: there are, however, two layers, each about\r\neighteen inches thick, of a dark brown, finer-grained stone, having a\r\nconchoidal, semi-porcellanic fracture, which can be followed with the\r\neye for some miles across the country.\r\n\r\nI believe this last great bed is covered by other nearly similar\r\nalternations; but the section is here obscured by a tilt from the next\r\nporphyritic chain, presently to be described. I have given this section\r\nin detail, as being illustrative of the general character of the\r\nmountains in this neighbourhood; but it must not be supposed that any\r\none stratum long preserves the same character. At a distance of between\r\nonly two and three miles the green mudstones and white indurated tuffs\r\nare to a great extent replaced by red sandstone and black calcareous\r\nshaly rocks, alternating together. The white indurated tuff, bed 11,\r\nhere contains little or no gypsum, whereas on the northern and opposite\r\nside of the valley, it is of much greater thickness and abounds with\r\nlayers of gypsum, some of them alternating with thin seams of\r\ncrystalline carbonate of lime. The uppermost, dark-coloured, hard\r\nmudstone, bed 12, is in this neighbourhood the most constant stratum.\r\nThe whole series differs to a considerable extent, especially in its\r\nupper part, from that met with at [BB], in the lower part of the\r\nvalley; nevertheless, I do not doubt that they are equivalents.\r\n\r\nFOURTH AXIS OF ELEVATION (VALLEY OF COPIAPO).\r\n\r\nThis axis is formed of a chain of mountains [F], of which the central\r\nmasses (near La Punta) consist of andesite containing green hornblende\r\nand coppery mica, and the outer masses of greenish and black\r\nporphyries, together with some fine lilac-coloured claystone porphyry;\r\nall these porphyries being injected and broken up by small hummocks of\r\nandesite. The central great mass of this latter rock, is covered on the\r\neastern side by a black, fine-grained, highly micaceous slate, which,\r\ntogether with the succeeding mountains of porphyry, are traversed by\r\nnumerous white dikes, branching from the andesite, and some of them\r\nextending in straight lines, to a distance of at least two miles. The\r\nmountains of porphyry eastward of the micaceous schist soon, but\r\ngradually, assume (as observed in so many other cases) a stratified\r\nstructure, and can then be recognised as a part of the porphyritic\r\nconglomerate formation. These strata [G] are inclined at a high angle\r\nto the S.E., and form a mass from fifteen hundred to two thousand feet\r\nin thickness. The gypseous masses to the west already described, dip\r\ndirectly towards this axis, with the strata only in a few places (one\r\nof which is represented in the section) thrown from it: hence this\r\nfourth axis is mainly uniclinal towards the S.E., and just like our\r\nthird axis, only locally anticlinal.\r\n\r\nThe above strata of porphyritic conglomerate [G] with their\r\nsouth-eastward dip, come abruptly up against beds of the gypseous\r\nformation [H], which are gently, but irregularly, inclined westward: so\r\nthat there is here a synclinal axis and great fault. Further up the\r\nvalley, here running nearly north and south, the gypseous formation is\r\nprolonged for some distance; but the stratification is unintelligible,\r\nthe whole being broken up by faults, dikes, and metalliferous veins.\r\nThe strata consist chiefly of red calcareous sandstones, with numerous\r\nveins in the place of layers, of gypsum; the sandstone is associated\r\nwith some black calcareous slate-rock, and with green\r\npseudo-honestones, passing into porcelain-jasper. Still further up the\r\nvalley, near Las Amolanas [I], the gypseous strata become more regular,\r\ndipping at an angle of between 30 and 40 degrees to W.S.W., and\r\nconformably overlying, near the mouth of the ravine of Jolquera, strata\r\n[K] of porphyritic conglomerate. The whole series has been tilted by a\r\npartially concealed axis [L], of granite, andesite, and a granitic\r\nmixture of white feldspar, quartz, and oxide of iron.\r\n\r\nFIFTH AXIS OF ELEVATION (VALLEY OF COPIAPO, NEAR LOS AMOLANAS).\r\n\r\nI will describe in some detail the beds [I] seen here, which, as just\r\nstated, dip to W.S.W., at an angle of from 30 to 40 degrees. I had not\r\ntime to examine the underlying porphyritic conglomerate, of which the\r\nlowest beds, as seen at the mouth of the Jolquera, are highly compact,\r\nwith crystals of red oxide of iron; and I am not prepared to say\r\nwhether they are chiefly of volcanic or metamorphic origin. On these\r\nbeds there rests a coarse purplish conglomerate, very little\r\nmetamorphosed, composed of pebbles of porphyry, but remarkable from\r\ncontaining one pebble of granite;—of which fact no instance has\r\noccurred in the sections hitherto described. Above this conglomerate,\r\nthere is a black siliceous claystone, and above it numerous\r\nalternations of dark-purplish and green porphyries, which may be\r\nconsidered as the uppermost limit of the porphyritic conglomerate\r\nformation.\r\n\r\nAbove these porphyries comes a coarse, arenaceous conglomerate, the\r\nlower half white and the upper half of a pink colour, composed chiefly\r\nof pebbles of various porphyries, but with some of red sandstone and\r\njaspery rocks. In some of the more arenaceous parts of the\r\nconglomerate, there was an oblique or current lamination; a\r\ncircumstance which I did not elsewhere observe. Above this\r\nconglomerate, there is a vast thickness of thinly stratified,\r\npale-yellowish, siliceous sandstone, passing into a granular\r\nquartz-rock, used for grindstones (hence the name of the place Las\r\nAmolanas), and certainly belonging to the gypseous formation, as does\r\nprobably the immediately underlying conglomerate. In this yellowish\r\nsandstone there are layers of white and pale-red siliceous\r\nconglomerate; other layers with small, well-rounded pebbles of white\r\nquartz, like the bed at the R. Claro at Coquimbo; others of a greenish,\r\nfine-grained, less siliceous stone, somewhat resembling the\r\npseudo-honestones lower down the valley; and lastly, others of a black\r\ncalcareous shale-rock. In one of the layers of conglomerate, there was\r\nembedded a fragment of mica-slate, of which this is the first instance;\r\nhence perhaps, it is from a formation of mica-slate, that the numerous\r\nsmall pebbles of quartz, both here and at Coquimbo, have been derived.\r\nNot only does the siliceous sandstone include layers of the black,\r\nthinly stratified, not fissile, calcareous shale-rock, but in one place\r\nthe whole mass, especially the upper part, was, in a marvellously short\r\nhorizontal distance, after frequent alternations, replaced by it. When\r\nthis occurred, a mountain-mass, several thousand feet in thickness was\r\nthus composed; the black calcareous shale-rock, however, always\r\nincluded some layers of the pale-yellowish siliceous sandstone, of the\r\nred conglomerate, and of the greenish jaspery and pseudo-honestone\r\nvarieties. It likewise included three or four widely separated layers\r\nof a brown limestone, abounding with shells immediately to be\r\ndescribed. This pile of strata was in parts traversed by many veins of\r\ngypsum. The calcareous shale-rock, though when freshly broken quite\r\nblack, weathers into an ash- colour: in which respect and in general\r\nappearance, it perfectly resembles those great fossiliferous beds of\r\nthe Peuquenes range, alternating with gypsum and red sandstone,\r\ndescribed in the last chapter.\r\n\r\nThe shells out of the layers of brown limestone, included in the black\r\ncalcareous shale-rock, which latter, as just stated, replaces the white\r\nsiliceous sandstone, consist of:—\r\n\r\nPecten Dufreynoyi, d’Orbigny, “Voyage” Part Pal.

Sowerby as the A. echinata, by M. d’Orbigny as\r\ncertainly a new and distinct species, having a Jurassic aspect. The\r\nspecimen has been unfortunately lost.\r\n\r\nTerebratula aenigma, d’Orbigny, (var. of do. E. Forbes.)\r\n\r\nThis is the same variety, with that from Guasco, considered by M.\r\nD’Orbigny to be a distinct species from his T. aenigma, and related to\r\nT. obsoleta.\r\n\r\nPlagiostoma and Ammonites, fragments of.\r\n\r\nThe lower layers of the limestone contained thousands of the Gryphaea;\r\nand the upper ones as many of the Turritella, with the Gryphaea (nov.\r\nspecies) and Serpulae adhering to them; in all the layers, the\r\nTerebratula and fragments of the Pecten were included. It was evident,\r\nfrom the manner in which species were grouped together, that they had\r\nlived where now embedded. Before making any further remarks, I may\r\nstate, that higher up this same valley we shall again meet with a\r\nsimilar association of shells; and in the great Despoblado Valley,\r\nwhich branches off near the town from that of Copiapo, the Pecten\r\nDufreynoyi, some Gryphites (I believe G. Darwinii), and the TRUE\r\nTerebratula aenigma of d’Orbigny were found together in an equivalent\r\nformation, as will be hereafter seen. A specimen also, I may add, of\r\nthe true T. aenigma, was given me from the neighbourhood of the famous\r\nsilver mines of Chanuncillo, a little south of the valley of the\r\nCopiapo, and these mines, from their position, I have no doubt, lie\r\nwithin the great gypseous formation: the rocks close to one of the\r\nsilver veins, judging from fragments shown me, resemble those singular\r\nmetamorphosed deposits from the mining district of Arqueros near\r\nCoquimbo.\r\n\r\nI will reiterate the evidence on the association of these several\r\nshells in the several localities.\r\n\r\nCOQUIMBO.\r\n\r\nIn the same bed, Rio Claro: Pecten Dufreynoyi. Ostrea hemispherica.\r\nTerebratula aenigma. Spirifer linguiferoides.\r\n\r\nSame bed, near Arqueros: Hippurites Chilensis. Gryphaea orientalis.\r\n\r\nCollected by M. Domeyko from the same locality, apparently near\r\nArqueros: Terebratula aenigma and Terebratula ignaciana, in same block\r\nof limestone: Pecten Dufreynoyi. Ostrea hemispherica. Hippurites\r\nChilensis. Turritella Andii. Nautilus Domeykus.\r\n\r\nGUASCO.\r\n\r\nIn a collection from the Cordillera, given me: the specimens all in the\r\nsame condition: Pecten Dufreynoyi. Turritella Andii. Terebratula\r\nignaciana. Terebratula aenigma, var. Spirifer Chilensis.\r\n\r\nCOPIAPO.\r\n\r\nMingled together in alternating beds in the main valley of Copiapo near\r\nLas Amolanas, and likewise higher up the valley: Pecten Dufreynoyi.\r\nTurritella Andii. Terebratula aenigma, var. as at Guasco. Astarte\r\nDarwinii. Gryphaea Darwinii. Gryphaea nov. species? Perna Americana.\r\nAvicula, nov. species.\r\n\r\nMain valley of Copiapo, apparently same formation with that of\r\nAmolanas: Terebratula aenigma (true).\r\n\r\nIn the same bed, high up the great lateral valley of the Despoblado, in\r\nthe ravine of Maricongo: Terebratula aenigma (true). Pecten Dufreynoyi.\r\nGryphaea Darwinii?\r\n\r\nConsidering this table, I think it is impossible to doubt that all\r\nthese fossils belong to the same formation. If, however, the species\r\nfrom Las Amolanas, in the Valley of Copiapo, had, as in the case of\r\nthose from Guasco, been separately examined, they would probably have\r\nbeen ranked as oolitic; for, although no Spirifers were found here, all\r\nthe other species, with the exception of the Pecten, Turritella, and\r\nAstarte, have a more ancient aspect than cretaceous forms. On the other\r\nhand, taking into account the evidence derived from the cretaceous\r\ncharacter of these three shells, and of the Hippurites, Gryphaea\r\norientalis, and Ostrea, from Coquimbo, we are driven back to the\r\nprovisional name already used of cretaceo-oolitic. From geological\r\nevidence, I believe this formation to be the equivalent of the\r\nNeocomian beds of the Cordillera of Central Chile.\r\n\r\nTo return to our section near Las Amolanas:—Above the yellow siliceous\r\nsandstone, or the equivalent calcareous slate-rock, with its bands of\r\nfossil-shells, according as the one or other prevails, there is a pile\r\nof strata, which cannot be less than from two to three thousand feet in\r\nthickness, in main part composed of a coarse, bright red conglomerate,\r\nwith many intercalated beds of red sandstone, and some of green and\r\nother coloured porcelain-jaspery layers. The included pebbles are\r\nwell-rounded, varying from the size of an egg to that of a\r\ncricket-ball, with a few larger; and they consist chiefly of\r\nporphyries. The basis of the conglomerate, as well as some of the\r\nalternating thin beds, are formed of a red, rather harsh, easily\r\nfusible sandstone, with crystalline calcareous particles. This whole\r\ngreat pile is remarkable from the thousands of huge, embedded,\r\nsilicified trunks of trees, one of which was eight feet long, and\r\nanother eighteen feet in circumference: how marvellous it is, that\r\nevery vessel in so thick a mass of wood should have been converted into\r\nsilex! I brought home many specimens, and all of them, according to Mr.\r\nR. Brown, present a coniferous structure.\r\n\r\nAbove this great conglomerate, we have from two to three hundred feet\r\nin thickness of red sandstone; and above this, a stratum of black\r\ncalcareous slate-rock, like that which alternates with and replaces the\r\nunderlying yellowish-white, siliceous sandstone. Close to the junction\r\nbetween this upper black slate-rock and the upper red sandstone, I\r\nfound the Gryphaea Darwinii, the Turritella Andii, and vast numbers of\r\na bivalve, too imperfect to be recognised. Hence we see that, as far as\r\nthe evidence of these two shells serves—and the Turritella is an\r\neminently characteristic species—the whole thickness of this vast pile\r\nof strata belongs to the same age. Again, above the last-mentioned\r\nupper red sandstone, there were several alternations of the black,\r\ncalcareous slate-rock; but I was unable to ascend to them. All these\r\nuppermost strata, like the lower ones, vary extremely in character in\r\nshort horizontal distances. The gypseous formation, as here seen, has a\r\ncoarser, more mechanical texture, and contains much more siliceous\r\nmatter than the corresponding beds lower down the valley. Its total\r\nthickness, together with the upper beds of the porphyritic\r\nconglomerate, I estimated at least at 8,000 feet; and only a small\r\nportion of the porphyritic conglomerate, which on the eastern flank of\r\nthe fourth axis of elevation appeared to be from fifteen hundred to two\r\nthousand feet thick, is here included. As corroborative of the great\r\nthickness of the gypseous formation, I may mention that in the\r\nDespoblado Valley (which branches from the main valley a little above\r\nthe town of Copiapo) I found a corresponding pile of red and white\r\nsandstones, and of dark, calcareous, semi-jaspery mudstones, rising\r\nfrom a nearly level surface and thrown into an absolutely vertical\r\nposition; so that, by pacing, I ascertained their thickness to be\r\nnearly two thousand seven hundred feet; taking this as a standard of\r\ncomparison, I estimated the thickness of the strata ABOVE the\r\nporphyritic conglomerate at 7,000 feet.\r\n\r\nThe fossils before enumerated, from the limestone-layers in the whitish\r\nsiliceous sandstone, are now covered, on the least computation, by\r\nstrata from 5,000 to 6,000 feet in thickness. Professor E. Forbes\r\nthinks that these shells probably lived at a depth of from about 30 to\r\n40 fathoms, that is from 180 to 240 feet; anyhow, it is impossible that\r\nthey could have lived at the depth of from 5,000 to 6,000 feet. Hence\r\nin this case, as in that of the Puente del Inca, we may safely conclude\r\nthat the bottom of the sea on which the shells lived, subsided, so as\r\nto receive the superincumbent submarine strata: and this subsidence\r\nmust have taken place during the existence of these shells; for, as I\r\nhave shown, some of them occur high up as well as low down in the\r\nseries. That the bottom of the sea subsided, is in harmony with the\r\npresence of the layers of coarse, well- rounded pebbles included\r\nthroughout this whole pile of strata, as well as of the great upper\r\nmass of conglomerate from 2,000 to 3,000 feet thick; for coarse gravel\r\ncould hardly have been formed or spread out at the profound depths\r\nindicated by the thickness of the strata. The subsidence, also, must\r\nhave been slow to have allowed of this often-recurrent spreading out of\r\nthe pebbles. Moreover, we shall presently see that the surfaces of some\r\nof the streams of porphyritic lava beneath the gypseous formation, are\r\nso highly amygdaloidal that it is scarcely possible to believe that\r\nthey flowed under the vast pressure of a deep ocean. The conclusion of\r\na great subsidence during the existence of these cretaceo-oolitic\r\nfossils, may, I believe, be extended to the district of Coquimbo,\r\nalthough owing to the fossiliferous beds there not being directly\r\ncovered by the upper gypseous strata, which in the section north of the\r\nvalley are about 6,000 feet in thickness, I did not there insist on\r\nthis conclusion.\r\n\r\nThe pebbles in the above conglomerates, both in the upper and lower\r\nbeds, are all well rounded, and, though chiefly composed of various\r\nporphyries, there are some of red sandstone and of a jaspery stone,\r\nboth like the rocks intercalated in layers in this same gypseous\r\nformation; there was one pebble of mica-slate and some of quartz,\r\ntogether with many particles of quartz. In these respects there is a\r\nwide difference between the gypseous conglomerates and those of the\r\nporphyritic-conglomerate formation, in which latter, angular and\r\nrounded fragments, almost exclusively composed of porphyries, are\r\nmingled together, and which, as already often remarked, probably were\r\nejected from craters deep under the sea. From these facts I conclude,\r\nthat during the formation of the conglomerates, land existed in the\r\nneighbourhood, on the shores of which the innumerable pebbles were\r\nrounded and thence dispersed, and on which the coniferous forests\r\nflourished—for it is improbable that so many thousand logs of wood\r\nshould have drifted from any great distance. This land, probably\r\nislands, must have been mainly formed of porphyries, with some\r\nmica-slate, whence the quartz was derived, and with some red sandstone\r\nand jaspery rocks. This latter fact is important, as it shows that in\r\nthis district, even previously to the deposition of the lower gypseous\r\nor cretaceo-oolitic beds, strata of an analogous nature had elsewhere,\r\nno doubt in the more central ranges of the Cordillera, been elevated;\r\nthus recalling to our minds the relations of the Cumbre and Uspallata\r\nchains. Having already referred to the great lateral valley of the\r\nDespoblado, I may mention that above the 2,700 feet of red and white\r\nsandstone and dark mudstone, there is a vast mass of coarse, hard, red\r\nconglomerate, some thousand feet in thickness, which contains much\r\nsilicified wood, and evidently corresponds with the great upper\r\nconglomerate at Las Amolanas: here, however, the conglomerate consists\r\nalmost exclusively of pebbles of granite, and of disintegrated crystals\r\nof reddish feldspar and quartz firmly recemented together. In this\r\ncase, we may conclude that the land whence the pebbles were derived,\r\nand on which the now silicified trees once flourished, was formed of\r\ngranite.\r\n\r\nThe mountains near Las Amolanas, composed of the cretaceo-oolitic\r\nstrata, are interlaced with dikes like a spider’s web, to an extent\r\nwhich I have never seen equalled, except in the denuded interior of a\r\nvolcanic crater: north and south lines, however, predominate. These\r\ndikes are composed of green, white, and blackish rocks, all porphyritic\r\nwith feldspar, and often with large crystals of hornblende. The white\r\nvarieties approach closely in character to andesite, which composes as\r\nwe have seen, the injected axes of so many of the lines of elevation.\r\nSome of the green varieties are finely laminated, parallel to the walls\r\nof the dikes.\r\n\r\nSIXTH AXIS OF ELEVATION (VALLEY OF COPIAPO).\r\n\r\nThis axis consists of a broad mountainous mass [O] of andesite,\r\ncomposed of albite, brown mica, and chlorite, passing into andesitic\r\ngranite, with quartz: on its western side it has thrown off, at a\r\nconsiderable angle, a thick mass of stratified porphyries, including\r\nmuch epidote [NN], and remarkable only from being divided into very\r\nthin beds, as highly amygdaloidal on their surfaces as subaerial\r\nlava-streams are often vesicular. This porphyritic formation is\r\nconformably covered, as seen some way up the ravine of Jolquera, by a\r\nmere remnant of the lower part of the cretaceo-oolitic formation [MM],\r\nwhich in one part encases, as represented in the coloured section, the\r\nfoot of the andesitic axis [L], of the already described fifth line,\r\nand in another part entirely conceals it: in this latter case, the\r\ngypseous or cretaceo-oolitic strata falsely appeared to dip under the\r\nporphyritic conglomerate of the fifth axis. The lowest bed of the\r\ngypseous formation, as seen here [M], is of yellowish siliceous\r\nsandstone, precisely like that of Amolanas, interlaced in parts with\r\nveins of gypsum, and including layers of the black, calcareous,\r\nnon-fissile slate-rock: the Turritella Andii, Pecten Dufreynoyi,\r\nTerebratula aenigma, var., and some Gryphites were embedded in these\r\nlayers. The sandstone varies in thickness from only twenty to eighty\r\nfeet; and this variation is caused by the inequalities in the upper\r\nsurface of an underlying stream of purple claystone porphyry. Hence the\r\nabove fossils here lie at the very base of the gypseous or\r\ncretaceo-oolitic formation, and hence they were probably once covered\r\nup by strata about seven thousand feet in thickness: it is, however,\r\npossible, though from the nature of all the other sections in this\r\ndistrict not probable, that the porphyritic claystone lava may in this\r\ncase have invaded a higher level in the series. Above the sandstone\r\nthere is a considerable mass of much indurated, purplish-black,\r\ncalcareous claystone, allied in nature to the often-mentioned black\r\ncalcareous slate- rock. Eastward of the broad andesitic axis of this\r\nsixth line, and penetrated by many dikes from it, there is a great\r\nformation [P] of mica-schist, with its usual variations, and passing in\r\none part into a ferruginous quartz-rock. The folia are curved and\r\nhighly inclined, generally dipping eastward. It is probable that this\r\nmica-schist is an old formation, connected with the granitic rocks and\r\nmetamorphic schists near the coast; and that the one fragment of\r\nmica-slate, and the pebbles of quartz low down in the gypseous\r\nformation at Las Amolanas, have been derived from it. The mica-schist\r\nis succeeded by stratified porphyritic conglomerate [Q] of great\r\nthickness, dipping eastward with a high inclination: I have included\r\nthis latter mountain-mass in the same anticlinal axis with the\r\nporphyritic streams [NN]; but I am far from sure that the two masses\r\nmay not have been independently upheaved.\r\n\r\nSEVENTH AXIS OF ELEVATION.\r\n\r\nProceeding up the ravine, we come to another mass [R] of andesite; and\r\nbeyond this, we again have a very thick, stratified porphyritic\r\nformation [S], dipping at a small angle eastward, and forming the basal\r\npart of the main Cordillera. I did not ascend the ravine any higher;\r\nbut here, near Castano, I examined several sections, of which I will\r\nnot give the details, only observing, that the porphyritic beds, or\r\nsubmarine lavas, preponderate greatly in bulk over the alternating\r\nsedimentary layers, which have been but little metamorphosed: these\r\nlatter consist of fine-grained red tuffs and of whitish volcanic\r\ngrit-stones, together with much of a singular, compact rock, having an\r\nalmost crystalline basis, finely brecciated with red and green\r\nfragments, and occasionally including a few large pebbles. The\r\nporphyritic lavas are highly amygdaloidal, both on their upper and\r\nlower surfaces; they consist chiefly of claystone porphyry, but with\r\none common variety, like some of the streams at the Puente del Inca,\r\nhaving a grey mottled basis, abounding with crystals of red hydrous\r\noxide of iron, green ones apparently of epidote, and a few glassy ones\r\nof feldspar. This pile of strata differs considerably from the basal\r\nstrata of the Cordillera in Central Chile, and may possibly belong to\r\nthe upper and gypseous series: I saw, however, in the bed of the\r\nvalley, one fragment of porphyritic breccia-conglomerate, exactly like\r\nthose great masses met with in the more southern parts of Chile.\r\n\r\nFinally, I must observe, that though I have described between the town\r\nof Copiapo and the western flank of the main Cordillera seven or eight\r\naxes of elevation, extending nearly north and south, it must not be\r\nsupposed that they all run continuously for great distances. As was\r\nstated to be the case in our sections across the Cordillera of Central\r\nChile, so here most of the lines of elevation, with the exception of\r\nthe first, third, and fifth, are very short. The stratification is\r\neverywhere disturbed and intricate; nowhere have I seen more numerous\r\nfaults and dikes. The whole district, from the sea to the Cordillera,\r\nis more or less metalliferous; and I heard of gold, silver, copper,\r\nlead, mercury, and iron veins. The metamorphic action, even in the\r\nlower strata, has certainly been far less here than in Central Chile.\r\n\r\nVALLEY OF THE DESPOBLADO.\r\n\r\nThis great barren valley, which has already been alluded to, enters the\r\nmain valley of Copiapo a little above the town: it runs at first\r\nnortherly, then N.E., and more easterly into the Cordillera; I followed\r\nits dreary course to the foot of the first main ridge. I will not give\r\na detailed section, because it would be essentially similar to that\r\nalready given, and because the stratification is exceedingly\r\ncomplicated. After leaving the plutonic hills near the town, I met\r\nfirst, as in the main valley, with the gypseous formation, having the\r\nsame diversified character as before, and soon afterwards with masses\r\nof porphyritic conglomerate, about one thousand feet in thickness. In\r\nthe lower part of this formation there were very thick beds composed of\r\nfragments of claystone porphyries, both angular and rounded, with the\r\nsmaller ones partially blended together and the basis rendered\r\nporphyritic; these beds separated distinct streams, from sixty to\r\neighty feet in thickness, of claystone lavas. Near Paipote, also, there\r\nwas much true porphyritic breccia-conglomerate: nevertheless, few of\r\nthese masses were metamorphosed to the same degree with the\r\ncorresponding formation in Central Chile. I did not meet in this valley\r\nwith any true andesite, but only with imperfect andesitic porphyry,\r\nincluding large crystals of hornblende: numerous as have been the\r\nvarieties of intrusive porphyries already mentioned, there were here\r\nmountains composed of a new kind, having a compact, smooth,\r\ncream-coloured basis, including only a few crystals of feldspar, and\r\nmottled with dendritic spots of oxide of iron. There were also some\r\nmountains of a porphyry with a brick-red basis, containing irregular,\r\noften lens-shaped, patches of compact feldspar, and crystals of\r\nfeldspar, which latter to my surprise I find to be orthite.\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the first ridge of the main Cordillera, in the ravine of\r\nMaricongo, and at an elevation which, from the extreme coldness and\r\nappearance of the vegetation, I estimated at about ten thousand feet, I\r\nfound beds of white sandstone and of limestone including the Pecten\r\nDufreynoyi, Terebratula aenigma, and some Gryphites. This ridge throws\r\nthe water on the one hand into the Pacific, and on the other, as I was\r\ninformed, into a great gravel-covered, basin-like plain, including a\r\nsalt- lake, and without any drainage-exit. In crossing the Cordillera\r\nby this Pass, it is said that three principal ridges must be traversed,\r\ninstead of two, or only one as in Central Chile.\r\n\r\nThe crest of this first main ridge and the surrounding mountains, with\r\nthe exception of a few lofty pinnacles, are capped by a great thickness\r\nof a horizontally stratified, tufaceous deposit. The lowest bed is of a\r\npale purple colour, hard, fine-grained, and full of broken crystals of\r\nfeldspar and scales of mica. The middle bed is coarser, and less hard,\r\nand hence weathers into very sharp pinnacles; it includes very small\r\nfragments of granite, and innumerable ones of all sizes of grey\r\nvesicular trachyte, some of which were distinctly rounded. The\r\nuppermost bed is about two hundred feet in thickness, of a darker\r\ncolour and apparently hard: but I had not time to ascend to it. These\r\nthree horizontal beds may be seen for the distance of many leagues,\r\nespecially westward or in the direction of the Pacific, capping the\r\nsummits of the mountains, and standing on the opposite sides of the\r\nimmense valleys at exactly corresponding heights. If united they would\r\nform a plain, inclined very slightly towards the Pacific; the beds\r\nbecome thinner in this direction, and the tuff (judging from one point\r\nto which I ascended, some way down the valley) finer-grained and of\r\nless specific gravity, though still compact and sonorous under the\r\nhammer. The gently inclined, almost horizontal stratification, the\r\npresence of some rounded pebbles, and the compactness of the lowest\r\nbed, though rendering it probable, would not have convinced me that\r\nthis mass had been of subaqueous origin, for it is known that volcanic\r\nashes falling on land and moistened by rain often become hard and\r\nstratified; but beds thus originating, and owing their consolidation to\r\natmospheric moisture, would have covered almost equally every\r\nneighbouring summit, high and low, and would not have left those above\r\na certain exact level absolutely bare; this circumstance seems to me to\r\nprove that the volcanic ejections were arrested at their present,\r\nwidely extended, equable level, and there consolidated by some other\r\nmeans than simple atmospheric moisture; and this no doubt must have\r\nbeen a sheet of water. A lake at this great height, and without a\r\nbarrier on any one side, is out of the question; consequently we must\r\nconclude that the tufaceous matter was anciently deposited beneath the\r\nsea. It was certainly deposited before the excavation of the valleys,\r\nor at least before their final enlargement (I have endeavoured to show\r\nin my “Journal” etc. (2nd edition) page 355, that this arid valley was\r\nleft by the retreating sea, as the land slowly rose, in the state in\r\nwhich we now see it.); and I may add, that Mr. Lambert, a gentleman\r\nwell acquainted with this country, informs me, that in ascending the\r\nravine of Santandres (which branches off from the Despoblado) he met\r\nwith streams of lava and much erupted matter capping all the hills of\r\ngranite and porphyry, with the exception of some projecting points; he\r\nalso remarked that the valleys had been excavated subsequently to these\r\neruptions.\r\n\r\nThis volcanic formation, which I am informed by Mr. Lambert extends far\r\nnorthward, is of interest, as typifying what has taken place on a\r\ngrander scale on the corresponding western side of the Cordillera of\r\nPeru. Under another point of view, however, it possesses a far higher\r\ninterest, as confirming that conclusion drawn from the structure of the\r\nfringes of stratified shingle which are prolonged from the plains at\r\nthe foot of the Cordillera far up the valleys,—namely, that this great\r\nrange has been elevated in mass to a height of between eight and nine\r\nthousand feet (I may here mention that on the south side of the main\r\nvalley of Copiapo, near Potrero Seco, the mountains are capped by a\r\nthick mass of horizontally stratified shingle, at a height which I\r\nestimated at between fifteen hundred and two thousand feet above the\r\nbed of the valley. This shingle, I believe, forms the edge of a wide\r\nplain, which stretches southwards between two mountain ranges.); and\r\nnow, judging from this tufaceous deposit, we may conclude that the\r\nhorizontal elevation has been in the district of Copiapo about ten\r\nthousand feet.\r\n\r\n(FIGURE 24.)\r\n\r\nIn the valley of the Despoblado, the stratification, as before remarked\r\nhas been much disturbed, and in some points to a greater degree than I\r\nhave anywhere else seen. I will give two cases: a very thick mass of\r\nthinly stratified red sandstone, including beds of conglomerate, has\r\nbeen crushed together (as represented in Figure 24) into a yoke or\r\nurn-formed trough, so that the strata on both sides have been folded\r\ninwards: on the right hand the properly underlying porphyritic\r\nclaystone conglomerate is seen overlying the sandstone, but it soon\r\nbecomes vertical, and then is inclined towards the trough, so that the\r\nbeds radiate like the spokes of a wheel: on the left hand, the inverted\r\nporphyritic conglomerate also assumes a dip towards the trough, not\r\ngradually, as on the right hand, but by means of a vertical fault and\r\nsynclinal break; and a little still further on towards the left, there\r\nis a second great oblique fault (both shown by the arrow- lines), with\r\nthe strata dipping to a directly opposite point; these mountains are\r\nintersected by infinitely numerous dikes, some of which can be seen to\r\nrise from hummocks of greenstone, and can be traced for thousands of\r\nfeet. In the second case, two low ridges trend together and unite at\r\nthe head of a little wedge-shaped valley: throughout the right- hand\r\nridge, the strata dip at 45 degrees to the east; in the left-hand\r\nridge, we have the very same strata and at first with exactly the same\r\ndip; but in following this ridge up the valley, the strata are seen\r\nvery regularly to become more and more inclined until they stand\r\nvertical, they then gradually fall over (the basset edges forming\r\nsymmetrical serpentine lines along the crest), till at the very head of\r\nthe valley they are reversed at an angle of 45 degrees: so that at this\r\npoint the beds have been turned through an angle of 135 degrees; and\r\nhere there is a kind of anticlinal axis, with the strata on both sides\r\ndipping to opposite points at an angle of 45 degrees, but those on the\r\nleft hand upside down.\r\n\r\nON THE ERUPTIVE SOURCES OF THE PORPHYRITIC CLAYSTONE AND GREENSTONE\r\nLAVAS.\r\n\r\nIn Central Chile, from the extreme metamorphic action, it is in most\r\nparts difficult to distinguish between the streams of porphyritic lava\r\nand the porphyritic breccia-conglomerate, but here, at Copiapo, they\r\nare generally perfectly distinct, and in the Despoblado, I saw for the\r\nfirst time, two great strata of purple claystone porphyry, after having\r\nbeen for a considerable space closely united together, one above the\r\nother, become separated by a mass of fragmentary matter, and then both\r\nthin out;—the lower one more rapidly than the upper and greater stream.\r\nConsidering the number and thickness of the streams of porphyritic\r\nlava, and the great thickness of the beds of breccia-conglomerate,\r\nthere can be little doubt that the sources of eruption must originally\r\nhave been numerous: nevertheless, it is now most difficult even to\r\nconjecture the precise point of any one of the ancient submarine\r\ncraters. I have repeatedly observed mountains of porphyries, more or\r\nless distinctly stratified towards their summits or on their flanks,\r\nwithout a trace of stratification in their central and basal parts: in\r\nmost cases, I believe this is simply due either to the obliterating\r\neffects of metamorphic action, or to such parts having been mainly\r\nformed of intrusive porphyries, or to both causes conjoined; in some\r\ninstances, however, it appeared to me very probable that the great\r\ncentral unstratified masses of porphyry were the now partially denuded\r\nnuclei of the old submarine volcanoes, and that the stratified parts\r\nmarked the points whence the streams flowed. In one case alone, and it\r\nwas in this Valley of the Despoblado, I was able actually to trace a\r\nthick stratum of purplish porphyry, which for a space of some miles\r\nconformably overlay the usual alternating beds of breccia-conglomerates\r\nand claystone lavas, until it became united with, and blended into, a\r\nmountainous mass of various unstratified porphyries.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of tracing the streams of porphyries to their ancient\r\nand doubtless numerous eruptive sources, may be partly explained by the\r\nvery general disturbance which the Cordillera in most parts has\r\nsuffered; but I strongly suspect that there is a more specific cause,\r\nnamely, THAT THE ORIGINAL POINTS OF ERUPTION TEND TO BECOME THE POINTS\r\nOF INJECTION. This in itself does not seem improbable; for where the\r\nearth’s crust has once yielded, it would be liable to yield again,\r\nthough the liquified intrusive matter might not be any longer enabled\r\nto reach the submarine surface and flow as lava. I have been led to\r\nthis conclusion, from having so frequently observed that, where part of\r\nan unstratified mountain-mass resembled in mineralogical character the\r\nadjoining streams or strata, there were several other kinds of\r\nintrusive porphyries and andesitic rocks injected into the same point.\r\nAs these intrusive mountain-masses form most of the axes-lines in the\r\nCordillera, whether anticlinal, uniclinal, or synclinal, and as the\r\nmain valleys have generally been hollowed out along these lines, the\r\nintrusive masses have generally suffered much denudation. Hence they\r\nare apt to stand in some degree isolated, and to be situated at the\r\npoints where the valleys abruptly bend, or where the main tributaries\r\nenter. On this view of there being a tendency in the old points of\r\neruption to become the points of subsequent injection and disturbance,\r\nand consequently of denudation, it ceases to be surprising that the\r\nstreams of lava in the porphyritic claystone conglomerate formation,\r\nand in other analogous cases, should most rarely be traceable to their\r\nactual sources.\r\n\r\nIQUIQUE, SOUTHERN PERU.\r\n\r\nDifferently from what we have seen throughout Chile, the coast here is\r\nformed not by the granitic series, but by an escarpment of the\r\nporphyritic conglomerate formation, between two and three thousand feet\r\nin height. (The lowest point, where the road crosses the\r\ncoast-escarpment, is 1,900 feet by the barometer above the level of the\r\nsea.) I had time only for a very short examination; the chief part of\r\nthe escarpment appears to be composed of various reddish and purple,\r\nsometimes laminated, porphyries, resembling those of Chile; and I saw\r\nsome of the porphyritic breccia-conglomerate; the stratification\r\nappeared but little inclined. The uppermost part, judging from the\r\nrocks near the famous silver mine of Huantajaya, consists of laminated,\r\nimpure, argillaceous, purplish-grey limestone, associated, I believe,\r\nwith some purple sandstone. (Mr. Bollaert has described “Geological\r\nProceedings” volume 2 page 598, a singular mass of stratified detritus,\r\ngravel, and sand, eighty-one yards in thickness, overlying the\r\nlimestone, and abounding with loose masses of silver ore. The miners\r\nbelieve that they can attribute these masses to their proper veins.) In\r\nthe limestone shells are found: the three following species were given\r\nme:—\r\n\r\nLucina Americana, E. Forbes. Terebratula inca, E. Forbes. Terebratula\r\naenigma, D’Orbigny.\r\n\r\nThis latter species we have seen associated with the fossils of which\r\nlists have been given in this chapter, in two places in the valley of\r\nCoquimbo, and in the ravine of Maricongo at Copiapo. Considering this\r\nfact, and the superposition of these beds on the porphyritic\r\nconglomerate formation; and, as we shall immediately see, from their\r\ncontaining much gypsum, and from their otherwise close general\r\nresemblance in mineralogical nature with the strata described in the\r\nvalley of Copiapo, I have little doubt that these fossiliferous beds of\r\nIquique belong to the great cretaceo-oolitic formation of Northern\r\nChile. Iquique is situated seven degrees latitude north of Copiapo; and\r\nI may here mention, that an Ammonites, nov. species, and an Astarte,\r\nnov. species, were given me from the Cerro Pasco, about ten degrees of\r\nlatitude north of Iquique, and M. D’Orbigny thinks that they probably\r\nindicate a Neocomian formation. Again, fifteen degrees of latitude\r\nnorthward, in Colombia, there is a grand fossiliferous deposit, now\r\nwell known from the labours of Von Buch, Lea, d’Orbigny, and Forbes,\r\nwhich belongs to the earlier stages of the cretaceous system. Hence,\r\nbearing in mind the character of the few fossils from Tierra del Fuego,\r\nthere is some evidence that a great portion of the stratified deposits\r\nof the whole vast range of the South American Cordillera belongs to\r\nabout the same geological epoch.\r\n\r\nProceeding from the coast escarpment inwards, I crossed, in a space of\r\nabout thirty miles, an elevated undulatory district, with the beds\r\ndipping in various directions. The rocks are of many kinds,—white\r\nlaminated, sometimes siliceous sandstone,—purple and red sandstone,\r\nsometimes so highly calcareous as to have a crystalline\r\nfracture,—argillaceous limestone,—black calcareous slate-rock, like\r\nthat so often described at Copiapo and other places,—thinly laminated,\r\nfine-grained, greenish, indurated, sedimentary, fusible rocks,\r\napproaching in character to the so- called pseudo-honestone of Chile,\r\nincluding thin contemporaneous veins of gypsum,—and lastly, much\r\ncalcareous, laminated porcelain jasper, of a green colour, with red\r\nspots, and of extremely easy fusibility: I noticed one conformable\r\nstratum of a freckled-brown, feldspathic lava. I may here mention that\r\nI heard of great beds of gypsum in the Cordillera. The only novel point\r\nin this formation, is the presence of innumerable thin layers of\r\nrock-salt, alternating with the laminated and hard, but sometimes\r\nearthy, yellowish, or bright red and ferruginous sandstones. The\r\nthickest layer of salt was only two inches, and it thinned out at both\r\nends. On one of these saliferous masses I noticed a stratum about\r\ntwelve feet thick, of dark-brown, hard brecciated, easily fusible rock,\r\ncontaining grains of quartz and of black oxide of iron, together with\r\nnumerous imperfect fragments of shells. The problem of the origin of\r\nsalt is so obscure, that every fact, even geographical position, is\r\nworth recording. (It is well known that stratified salt is found in\r\nseveral places on the shores of Peru. The island of San Lorenzo, off\r\nLima, is composed of a pile of thin strata, about eight hundred feet in\r\nthickness, composed of yellowish and purplish, hard siliceous, or\r\nearthy sandstones, alternating with thin layers of shale, which in\r\nplaces passes into a greenish, semi-porcellanic, fusible rock. There\r\nare some thin beds of reddish mudstone, and soft ferruginous\r\nrotten-stones, with layers of gypsum. In nearly all these varieties,\r\nespecially in the softer sandstones, there are numerous thin seams of\r\nrock-salt: I was informed that one layer has been found two inches in\r\nthickness. The manner in which the minutest fissures of the dislocated\r\nbeds have been penetrated by the salt, apparently by subsequent\r\ninfiltration, is very curious. On the south side of the island, layers\r\nof coal and of impure limestone have been discovered. Hence we here\r\nhave salt, gypsum, and coal associated together. The strata include\r\nveins of quartz, carbonate of lime, and iron pyrites; they have been\r\ndislocated by an injected mass of greenish-brown feldspathic trap. Not\r\nonly is salt abundant on the extreme western limits of the district\r\nbetween the Cordillera and the Pacific, but, according to Helms, it is\r\nfound in the outlying low hills on the eastern flank of the Cordillera.\r\nThese facts appear to me opposed to the theory, that rock-salt is due\r\nto the sinking of water, charged with salt, in mediterranean spaces of\r\nthe ocean. The general character of the geology of these countries\r\nwould rather lead to the opinion, that its origin is in some way\r\nconnected with volcanic heat at the bottom of the sea: see on this\r\nsubject Sir R. Murchison “Anniversary Address to the Geological\r\nSociety” 1843 page 65.) With the exception of these saliferous beds,\r\nmost of the rocks as already remarked, present a striking general\r\nresemblance with the upper parts of the gypseous or cretaceo-oolitic\r\nformation of Chile.\r\n\r\nMETALLIFEROUS VEINS.\r\n\r\nI have only a few remarks to make on this subject: in nine mining\r\ndistricts, some of them of considerable extent, which I visited in\r\nCENTRAL Chile, I found the PRINCIPAL veins running from between [N. and\r\nN.W.] to [S. and S.E.] (These mining districts are Yaquil near\r\nNancagua, where the direction of the chief veins, to which only in all\r\ncases I refer, is north and south; in the Uspallata range, the\r\nprevailing line is N.N.W. and S.S.E.; in the C. de Prado, it is N.N.W.\r\nand S.S.E.; near Illapel, it is N. by W. and S. by E.; at Los Hornos\r\nthe direction varies from between [N. and N.W.] to [S. and S.E.]; at\r\nthe C. de los Hornos (further northward), it is N.N.W. and S.S.E.; at\r\nPanuncillo, it is N.N.W. and S.S.E.; and, lastly, at Arqueros, the\r\ndirection is N.W. and S.E.): in some other places, however, their\r\ncourses appeared quite irregular, as is said to be generally the case\r\nin the whole valley of Copiapo: at Tambillos, south of Coquimbo, I saw\r\none large copper vein extending east and west. It is worthy of notice,\r\nthat the foliation of the gneiss and mica-slate, where such rocks\r\noccur, certainly tend to run like the metalliferous veins, though often\r\nirregularly, in a direction a little westward of north. At Yaquil, I\r\nobserved that the principal auriferous veins ran nearly parallel to the\r\ngrain or imperfect cleavage of the surrounding GRANITIC rocks. With\r\nrespect to the distribution of the different metals, copper, gold, and\r\niron are generally associated together, and are most frequently found\r\n(but with many exceptions, as we shall presently see) in the rocks of\r\nthe lower series, between the Cordillera and the Pacific, namely, in\r\ngranite, syenite, altered feldspathic clay-slate, gneiss, and as near\r\nGuasco mica-schist. The copper-ores consist of sulphurets, oxides, and\r\ncarbonates, sometimes with laminae of native metal: I was assured that\r\nin some cases (as at Panuncillo S.E. of Coquimbo), the upper part of\r\nthe same vein contains oxides, and the lower part sulphurets of copper.\r\n(The same fact has been observed by Mr. Taylor in Cuba: “London\r\nPhilosophical Journal” volume 11 page 21.) Gold occurs in its native\r\nform; it is believed that, in many cases, the upper part of the vein is\r\nthe most productive part: this fact probably is connected with the\r\nabundance of this metal in the stratified detritus of Chile, which must\r\nhave been chiefly derived from the degradation of the upper portions of\r\nthe rocks. These superficial beds of well-rounded gravel and sand,\r\ncontaining gold, appeared to me to have been formed under the sea close\r\nto the beach, during the slow elevation of the land: Schmidtmeyer\r\nremarks that in Chile gold is sought for in shelving banks at the\r\nheight of some feet on the sides of the streams, and not in their beds,\r\nas would have been the case had this metal been deposited by common\r\nalluvial action. (“Travels in Chile” page 29.) Very frequently the\r\ncopper-ores, including some gold, are associated with abundant\r\nmicaceous specular iron. Gold is often found in iron-pyrites: at two\r\ngold mines at Yaquil (near Nancagua), I was informed by the proprietor\r\nthat in one the gold was always associated with copper-pyrites, and in\r\nthe other with iron-pyrites: in this latter case, it is said that if\r\nthe vein ceases to contain iron-pyrites, it is yet worth while to\r\ncontinue the search, but if the iron-pyrites, when it reappears, is not\r\nauriferous, it is better at once to give up working the vein. Although\r\nI believe copper and gold are most frequently found in the lower\r\ngranitic and metamorphic schistose series, yet these metals occur both\r\nin the porphyritic conglomerate formation (as on the flanks of the Bell\r\nof Quillota and at Jajuel), and in the superincumbent strata. At Jajuel\r\nI was informed that the copper-ore, with some gold, is found only in\r\nthe greenstones and altered feldspathic clay-slate, which alternate\r\nwith the purple porphyritic conglomerate. Several gold veins and some\r\nof copper- ore are worked in several parts of the Uspallata range, both\r\nin the metamorphosed strata, which have been shown to have been of\r\nprobably subsequent origin to the Neocomian or gypseous formation of\r\nthe main Cordillera, and in the intrusive andesitic rocks of that\r\nrange. At Los Hornos (N.E. of Illapel), likewise, there are numerous\r\nveins of copper- pyrites and of gold, both in the strata of the\r\ngypseous formation and in the injected hills of andesite and various\r\nporphyries.\r\n\r\nSilver, in the form of a chloride, sulphuret, or an amalgam, or in its\r\nnative state, and associated with lead and other metals, and at\r\nArqueros with pure native copper, occurs chiefly in the upper great\r\ngypseous or cretaceo-oolitic formation which forms probably the richest\r\nmass in Chile. We may instance the mining districts of Arqueros near\r\nCoquimbo, and of nearly the whole valley of Copiapo, and of Iquique\r\n(where the principal veins run N.E. by E. and S.W. by W.), in Peru.\r\nHence comes Molina’s remark, that silver is born in the cold and\r\nsolitary deserts of the Upper Cordillera. There are, however,\r\nexceptions to this rule: at Paral (S.E. of Coquimbo) silver is found in\r\nthe porphyritic conglomerate formation; as I suspect is likewise the\r\ncase at S. Pedro de Nolasko in the Peuquenes Pass. Rich argentiferous\r\nlead is found in the clay-slate of the Uspallata range; and I saw an\r\nold silver-mine in a hill of syenite at the foot of the Bell of\r\nQuillota: I was also assured that silver has been found in the\r\nandesitic and porphyritic region between the town of Copiapo and the\r\nPacific. I have stated in a previous part of this chapter, that in two\r\nneighbouring mines at Arqueros the veins in one were productive when\r\nthey traversed the singular green sedimentary beds, and unproductive\r\nwhen crossing the reddish beds; whereas at the other mine exactly the\r\nreverse takes place; I have also described the singular and rare case\r\nof numerous particles of native silver and of the chloride being\r\ndisseminated in the green rock at the distance of a yard from the vein.\r\nMercury occurs with silver both at Arqueros and at Copiapo: at the base\r\nof C. de los Hornos (S.E. of Coquimbo, a different place from Los\r\nHornos, before mentioned) I saw in a syenitic rock numerous quartzose\r\nveins, containing a little cinnabar in nests: there were here other\r\nparallel veins of copper and of a ferrugino-auriferous ore. I believe\r\ntin has never been found in Chile.\r\n\r\nFrom information given me by Mr. Nixon of Yaquil (At the Durazno mine,\r\nthe gold is associated with copper-pyrites, and the veins contain large\r\nprisms of plumbago. Crystallised carbonate of lime is one of the\r\ncommonest minerals in the matrix of the Chilean veins.), and by others,\r\nit appears that in Chile those veins are generally most permanently\r\nproductive, which, consisting of various minerals (sometimes differing\r\nbut slightly from the surrounding rocks), include parallel strings RICH\r\nin metals; such a vein is called a veta real. More commonly the mines\r\nare worked only where one, two, or more thin veins or strings running\r\nin a different direction, intersect a POOR “veta real:” it is\r\nunanimously believed that at such points of intersection (cruceros),\r\nthe quantity of metal is much greater than that contained in other\r\nparts of the intersecting veins. In some cruceros or points of\r\nintersection, the metals extend even beyond the walls of the main,\r\nbroad, stony vein. It is said that the greater the angle of\r\nintersection, the greater the produce; and that nearly parallel strings\r\nattract each other; in the Uspallata range, I observed that numerous\r\nthin auri-ferruginous veins repeatedly ran into knots, and then\r\nbranched out again. I have already described the remarkable manner in\r\nwhich rocks of the Uspallata range are indurated and blackened (as if\r\nby a blast of gunpowder) to a considerable distance from the metallic\r\nveins.\r\n\r\nFinally, I may observe, that the presence of metallic veins seems\r\nobviously connected with the presence of intrusive rocks, and with the\r\ndegree of metamorphic action which the different districts of Chile\r\nhave undergone. (Sir R. Murchison and his fellow travellers have given\r\nsome striking facts on this subject in their account of the Ural\r\nMountains (“Geological Proceedings” volume 3 page 748.) Such\r\nmetamorphosed areas are generally accompanied by numerous dikes and\r\ninjected masses of andesite and various porphyries: I have in several\r\nplaces traced the metalliferous veins from the intrusive masses into\r\nthe encasing strata. Knowing that the porphyritic conglomerate\r\nformation consists of alternate streams of submarine lavas and of the\r\ndebris of anciently erupted rocks, and that the strata of the upper\r\ngypseous formation sometimes include submarine lavas, and are composed\r\nof tuffs, mudstones, and mineral substances, probably due to volcanic\r\nexhalations,—the richness of these strata is highly remarkable when\r\ncompared with the erupted beds, often of submarine origin, but NOT\r\nMETAMORPHOSED, which compose the numerous islands in the Pacific,\r\nIndian, and Atlantic Oceans; for in these islands metals are entirely\r\nabsent, and their nature even unknown to the aborigines.\r\n\r\nA SUMMARY OF THE GEOLOGICAL HISTORY OF THE CHILEAN CORDILLERA, AND OF\r\nTHE SOUTHERN PARTS OF SOUTH AMERICA.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the shores of the Pacific, for a space of 1,200 miles\r\nfrom Tres Montes to Copiapo, and I believe for a very much greater\r\ndistance, are composed, with the exception of the tertiary basins, of\r\nmetamorphic schists, plutonic rocks, and more or less altered\r\nclay-slate. On the floor of the ocean thus constituted, vast streams of\r\nvarious purplish claystone and greenstone porphyries were poured forth,\r\ntogether with great alternating piles of angular and rounded fragments\r\nof similar rocks ejected from the submarine craters. From the\r\ncompactness of the streams and fragments, it is probable that, with the\r\nexception of some districts in Northern Chile, the eruptions took place\r\nin profoundly deep water. The orifices of eruption appear to have been\r\nstudded over a breadth, with some outliers, of from fifty to one\r\nhundred miles: and closely enough together, both north and south, and\r\neast and west, for the ejected matter to form a continuous mass, which\r\nin Central Chile is more than a mile in thickness. I traced this\r\nmould-like mass, for only 450 miles; but judging from what I saw at\r\nIquique, from specimens, and from published accounts, it appears to\r\nhave a manifold greater length. In the basal parts of the series, and\r\nespecially towards the flanks of the range, mud, since converted into a\r\nfeldspathic slaty rock, and sometimes into greenstone, was occasionally\r\ndeposited between the beds of erupted matter: with this exception the\r\nuniformity of the porphyritic rocks is very remarkable.\r\n\r\nAt the period when the claystone and greenstone porphyries nearly or\r\nquite ceased being erupted, that great pile of strata which, from often\r\nabounding with gypsum, I have generally called the gypseous formation\r\nwas deposited, and feldspathic lavas, together with other singular\r\nvolcanic rocks, were occasionally poured forth: I am far from\r\npretending that any distinct line of demarcation can be drawn between\r\nthis formation and the underlying porphyries and porphyritic\r\nconglomerate, but in a mass of such great thickness, and between beds\r\nof such widely different mineralogical nature, some division was\r\nnecessary. At about the commencement of the gypseous period, the bottom\r\nof the sea here seems first to have been peopled by shells, not many in\r\nkind, but abounding in individuals. At the P. del Inca the fossils are\r\nembedded near the base of the formation; in the Peuquenes range, at\r\ndifferent levels, halfway up, and even higher in the series; hence, in\r\nthese sections, the whole pile of strata belongs to the same period:\r\nthe same remark is applicable to the beds at Copiapo, which attain a\r\nthickness of between seven and eight thousand feet. The fossil shells\r\nin the Cordillera of Central Chile, in the opinion of all the\r\npalaeontologists who have examined them, belong to the earlier stages\r\nof the cretaceous system; whilst in Northern Chile there is a most\r\nsingular mixture of cretaceous and oolitic forms: from the geological\r\nrelations, however, of these two districts, I cannot but think that\r\nthey all belong to nearly the same epoch, which I have provisionally\r\ncalled cretaceo-oolitic.\r\n\r\nThe strata in this formation, composed of black calcareous shaly-rocks\r\nof red and white, and sometimes siliceous sandstone, of coarse\r\nconglomerates, limestones, tuffs, dark mudstones, and those singular\r\nfine-grained rocks which I have called pseudo-honestones, vast beds of\r\ngypsum, and many other jaspery and scarcely describable varieties, vary\r\nand replace each other in short horizontal distances, to an extent, I\r\nbelieve, unequalled even in any tertiary basin. Most of these\r\nsubstances are easily fusible, and have apparently been derived either\r\nfrom volcanoes still in quiet action, or from the attrition of volcanic\r\nproducts. If we picture to ourselves the bottom of the sea, rendered\r\nuneven in an extreme degree, with numerous craters, some few\r\noccasionally in eruption, but the greater number in the state of\r\nsolfataras, discharging calcareous, siliceous, ferruginous matters, and\r\ngypsum or sulphuric acid to an amount surpassing, perhaps, even the\r\nexisting sulphureous volcanoes of Java (Von Buch’s “Description\r\nPhysique des Iles Canaries” page 428.), we shall probably understand\r\nthe circumstances under which this singular pile of varying strata was\r\naccumulated. The shells appear to have lived at the quiescent periods\r\nwhen only limestone or calcareo-argillaceous matter was depositing.\r\nFrom Dr. Gillies’ account, this gypseous or cretaceo-oolitic formation\r\nextends as far south as the Pass of Planchon, and I followed it\r\nnorthward at intervals for 500 miles: judging from the character of the\r\nbeds with the Terebratula aenigma, at Iquique, it extends from four to\r\nfive hundred miles further: and perhaps even for ten degrees of\r\nlatitude north of Iquique to the Cerro Pasco, not far from Lima: again,\r\nwe know that a cretaceous formation, abounding with fossils, is largely\r\ndeveloped north of the equator, in Colombia: in Tierra del Fuego, at\r\nabout this same period, a wide district of clay-slate was deposited,\r\nwhich in its mineralogical characters and external features, might be\r\ncompared to the Silurian regions of North Wales. The gypseous\r\nformation, like that of the porphyritic breccia- conglomerate on which\r\nit rests, is of inconsiderable breadth; though of greater breadth in\r\nNorthern than in Central Chile.\r\n\r\nAs the fossil shells in this formation are covered, in the Peuquenes\r\nridge, by a great thickness of strata; at the Puente del Inca, by at\r\nleast five thousand feet; at Coquimbo, though the superposition there\r\nis less plainly seen, by about six thousand feet; and at Copiapo,\r\ncertainly by five or six thousand, and probably by seven thousand feet\r\n(the same species there recurring in the upper and lower parts of the\r\nseries), we may feel confident that the bottom of the sea subsided\r\nduring this cretaceo-oolitic period, so as to allow of the accumulation\r\nof the superincumbent submarine strata. This conclusion is confirmed\r\nby, or perhaps rather explains, the presence of the many beds at many\r\nlevels of coarse conglomerate, the well- rounded pebbles in which we\r\ncannot believe were transported in very deep water. Even the underlying\r\nporphyries at Copiapo. with their highly amygdaloidal surfaces, do not\r\nappear to have flowed under great pressure. The great sinking movement\r\nthus plainly indicated, must have extended in a north and south line\r\nfor at least four hundred miles, and probably was co- extensive with\r\nthe gypseous formation.\r\n\r\nThe beds of conglomerate just referred to, and the extraordinarily\r\nnumerous silicified trunks of fir-trees at Los Hornos, perhaps at\r\nCoquimbo and at two distant points in the valley of Copiapo, indicate\r\nthat land existed at this period in the neighbourhood. This land, or\r\nislands, in the northern part of the district of Copiapo, must have\r\nbeen almost exclusively composed, judging from the nature of the\r\npebbles of granite: in the southern parts of Copiapo, it must have been\r\nmainly formed of claystone porphyries, with some mica-schist, and with\r\nmuch sandstone and jaspery rocks exactly like the rocks in the gypseous\r\nformation, and no doubt belonging to its basal series. In several other\r\nplaces also, during the accumulation of the gypseous formation, its\r\nbasal parts and the underlying porphyritic conglomerate must likewise\r\nhave been already partially upheaved and exposed to wear and tear; near\r\nthe Puente del Inca and at Coquimbo, there must have existed masses of\r\nmica-schist or some such rock, whence were derived the many small\r\npebbles of opaque quartz. It follows from these facts, that in some\r\nparts of the Cordillera the upper beds of the gypseous formation must\r\nlie unconformably on the lower beds; and the whole gypseous formation,\r\nin parts, unconformably on the porphyritic conglomerate; although I saw\r\nno such cases, yet in many places the gypseous formation is entirely\r\nabsent; and this, although no doubt generally caused by quite\r\nsubsequent denudation, may in others be due to the underlying\r\nporphyritic conglomerate having been locally upheaved before the\r\ndeposition of the gypseous strata, and thus having become the source of\r\nthe pebbles of porphyry embedded in them. In the porphyritic\r\nconglomerate formation, in its lower and middle parts, there is very\r\nrarely any evidence, with the exception of the small quartz pebbles at\r\nJajuel near Aconcagua, and of the single pebble of granite at Copiapo,\r\nof the existence of neighbouring land: in the upper parts, however, and\r\nespecially in the district of Copiapo, the number of thoroughly\r\nwell-rounded pebbles of compact porphyries make me believe, that, as\r\nduring the prolonged accumulation of the gypseous formation the lower\r\nbeds had already been locally upheaved and exposed to wear and tear, so\r\nit was with the porphyritic conglomerate. Hence in following thus far\r\nthe geological history of the Cordillera, it may be inferred that the\r\nbed of a deep and open, or nearly open, ocean was filled up by\r\nporphyritic eruptions, aided probably by some general and some local\r\nelevations, to that comparatively shallow level at which the cretaceo-\r\noolitic shells first lived. At this period, the submarine craters\r\nyielded at intervals a prodigious supply of gypsum and other mineral\r\nexhalations, and occasionally, in certain places poured forth lavas,\r\nchiefly of a feldspathic nature: at this period, islands clothed with\r\nfir-trees and composed of porphyries, primary rocks, and the lower\r\ngypseous strata had already been locally upheaved, and exposed to the\r\naction of the waves;—the general movement, however, at this time having\r\nbeen over a very wide area, one of slow subsidence, prolonged till the\r\nbed of the sea sank several thousand feet.\r\n\r\nIn Central Chile, after the deposition of a great thickness of the\r\ngypseous strata, and after their upheaval, by which the Cumbre and\r\nadjoining ranges were formed, a vast pile of tufaceous matter and\r\nsubmarine lava was accumulated, where the Uspallata chain now stands;\r\nalso after the deposition and upheaval of the equivalent gypseous\r\nstrata of the Peuquenes range, the great thick mass of conglomerate in\r\nthe valley of Tenuyan was accumulated: during the deposition of the\r\nUspallata strata, we know absolutely, from the buried vertical trees,\r\nthat there was a subsidence of some thousand feet; and we may infer\r\nfrom the nature of the conglomerate in the valley of Tenuyan, that a\r\nsimilar and perhaps contemporaneous movement there took place. We have,\r\nthen, evidence of a second great period of subsidence; and, as in the\r\ncase of the subsidence which accompanied the accumulation of the\r\ncretaceo-oolitic strata, so this latter subsidence appears to have been\r\ncomplicated by alternate or local elevatory movement— for the vertical\r\ntrees, buried in the midst of the Uspallata strata, must have grown on\r\ndry land, formed by the upheaval of the lower submarine beds. Presently\r\nI shall have to recapitulate the facts, showing that at a still later\r\nperiod, namely, at nearly the commencement of the old tertiary deposits\r\nof Patagonia and of Chile, the continent stood at nearly its present\r\nlevel, and then, for the third time, slowly subsided to the amount of\r\nseveral hundred feet, and was afterwards slowly re-uplifted to its\r\npresent level.\r\n\r\nThe highest peaks of the Cordillera appear to consist of active or more\r\ncommonly dormant volcanoes,—such as Tupungato, Maypu, and Aconcagua,\r\nwhich latter stands 23,000 feet above the level of the sea, and many\r\nothers. The next highest peaks are formed of the gypseous and\r\nporphyritic strata, thrown into vertical or highly inclined positions.\r\nBesides the elevation thus gained by angular displacements, I infer,\r\nwithout any hesitation—from the stratified gravel-fringes which gently\r\nslope up the valleys of the Cordillera from the gravel-capped plains at\r\ntheir base, which latter are connected with the plains, still covered\r\nwith recent shells on the coast— that this great range has been\r\nupheaved in mass by a slow movement, to an amount of at least 8,000\r\nfeet. In the Despoblado Valley, north of Copiapo, the horizontal\r\nelevation, judging from the compact, stratified tufaceous deposit,\r\ncapping the distant mountains at corresponding heights, was about ten\r\nthousand feet. It is very possible, or rather probable, that this\r\nelevation in mass may not have been strictly horizontal, but more\r\nenergetic under the Cordillera, than towards the coast on either side;\r\nnevertheless, movements of this kind may be conveniently distinguished\r\nfrom those by which strata have been abruptly broken and upturned. When\r\nviewing the Cordillera, before having read Mr. Hopkins’s profound\r\n“Researches on Physical Geology,” the conviction was impressed on me,\r\nthat the angular dislocations, however violent, were quite subordinate\r\nin importance to the great upward movement in mass, and that they had\r\nbeen caused by the edges of the wide fissures, which necessarily\r\nresulted from the tension of the elevated area, having yielded to the\r\ninward rush of fluidified rock, and having thus been upturned.\r\n\r\nThe ridges formed by the angularly upheaved strata are seldom of great\r\nlength: in the central parts of the Cordillera they are generally\r\nparallel to each other, and run in north and south lines; but towards\r\nthe flanks they often extend more or less obliquely. The angular\r\ndisplacement has been much more violent in the central than in the\r\nexterior MAIN lines; but it has likewise been violent in some of the\r\nMINOR lines on the extreme flanks. The violence has been very unequal\r\non the same short lines; the crust having apparently tended to yield on\r\ncertain points along the lines of fissures. These points, I have\r\nendeavoured to show, were probably first foci of eruption, and\r\nafterwards of injected masses of porphyry and andesite. (Sir R.\r\nMurchison and his companions state “Geological Proceedings” volume 3\r\npage 747, that no true granite appears in the higher Ural Mountains;\r\nbut that syenitic greenstone—a rock closely analogous to our\r\nandesite—is far the most abundant of the intrusive masses.) The close\r\nsimilarity of the andesitic granites and porphyries, throughout Chile,\r\nTierra del Fuego, and even in Peru, is very remarkable. The prevalence\r\nof feldspar cleaving like albite, is common not only to the andesites,\r\nbut (as I infer from the high authority of Professor G. Rose, as well\r\nas from my own measurements) to the various claystone and greenstone\r\nporphyries, and to the trachytic lavas of the Cordillera. The andesitic\r\nrocks have in most cases been the last injected ones, and they probably\r\nform a continuous dome under this great range: they stand in intimate\r\nrelationship with the modern lavas; and they seem to have been the\r\nimmediate agent in metamorphosing the porphyritic conglomerate\r\nformation, and often likewise the gypseous strata, to the extraordinary\r\nextent to which they have suffered.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the age at which the several parallel ridges composing\r\nthe Cordillera were upthrown, I have little evidence. Many of them may\r\nhave been contemporaneously elevated and injected in the same manner as\r\nin volcanic archipelagoes lavas are contemporaneously ejected on the\r\nparallel lines of fissure. (“Volcanic Islands” etc.) But the pebbles\r\napparently derived from the wear and tear of the porphyritic\r\nconglomerate formation, which are occasionally present in the upper\r\nparts of this same formation, and are often present in the gypseous\r\nformation, together with the pebbles from the basal parts of the latter\r\nformation in its upper strata, render it almost certain that portions,\r\nwe may infer ridges, of these two formations were successively\r\nupheaved. In the case of the gigantic Portillo range, we may feel\r\nalmost certain that a preexisting granitic line was upraised (not by a\r\nsingle blow, as shown by the highly inclined basaltic streams in the\r\nvalley on its eastern flank) at a period long subsequent to the\r\nupheavement of the parallel Peuquenes range. (I have endeavoured to\r\nshow in my “Journal” 2nd edition page 321, that the singular fact of\r\nthe river, which drains the valley between these two ranges, passing\r\nthrough the Portillo and higher line, is explained by its slow and\r\nsubsequent elevation. There are many analogous cases in the drainage of\r\nrivers: see “Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal” volume 28 pages 33\r\nand 44.) Again, subsequently to the upheavement of the Cumbre chain,\r\nthat of Uspallata was formed and elevated; and afterwards, I may add,\r\nin the plain of Uspallata, beds of sand and gravel were violently\r\nupthrown. The manner in which the various kinds of porphyries and\r\nandesites have been injected one into the other, and in which the\r\ninfinitely numerous dikes of various composition intersect each other,\r\nplainly show that the stratified crust has been stretched and yielded\r\nmany times over the same points. With respect to the age of the axes of\r\nelevation between the Pacific and the Cordillera, I know little: but\r\nthere are some lines which must—namely, those running north and south\r\nin Chiloe, those eight or nine east and west, parallel, far-extended,\r\nmost symmetrical uniclinal lines at P. Rumena, and the short N.W.-S.E.\r\nand N.E.- S.W. lines at Concepcion—have been upheaved long after the\r\nformation of the Cordillera. Even during the earthquake of 1835, when\r\nthe linear north and south islet of St. Mary was uplifted several feet\r\nabove the surrounding area, we perhaps see one feeble step in the\r\nformation of a subordinate mountain-axis. In some cases, moreover, for\r\ninstance, near the baths of Cauquenes, I was forcibly struck with the\r\nsmall size of the breaches cut through the exterior mountain-ranges,\r\ncompared with the size of the same valleys higher up where entering the\r\nCordillera; and this circumstance appeared to me scarcely explicable,\r\nexcept on the idea of the exterior lines having been subsequently\r\nupthrown, and therefore having been exposed to a less amount of\r\ndenudation. From the manner in which the fringes of gravel are\r\nprolonged in unbroken slopes up the valleys of the Cordillera, I infer\r\nthat most of the greater dislocations took place during the earlier\r\nparts of the great elevation in mass: I have, however, elsewhere given\r\na case, and M. de Tschudi has given another, of a ridge thrown up in\r\nPeru across the bed of a river, and consequently after the final\r\nelevation of the country above the level of the sea. (“Reise in Peru”\r\nBand 2 s.8: Author’s “Journal” 2nd edition page 359.)\r\n\r\nAscending to the older tertiary formations, I will not again\r\nrecapitulate the remarks already given at the end of the Fifth\r\nChapter,—on their great extent, especially along the shores of the\r\nAtlantic—on their antiquity, perhaps corresponding with that of the\r\neocene deposits of Europe,—on the almost entire dissimilarity, though\r\nthe formations are apparently contemporaneous, of the fossils from the\r\neastern and western coasts, as is likewise the case, even in a still\r\nmore marked degree, with the shells now living in these opposite though\r\napproximate seas,—on the climate of this period not having been more\r\ntropical than what might have been expected from the latitudes of the\r\nplaces under which the deposits occur; a circumstance rendered well\r\nworthy of notice, from the contrast with what is known to have been the\r\ncase during the older tertiary periods of Europe, and likewise from the\r\nfact of the southern hemisphere having suffered at a much later period,\r\napparently at the same time with the northern hemisphere, a colder or\r\nmore equable temperature, as shown by the zones formerly affected by\r\nice-action. Nor will I recapitulate the proofs of the bottom of the\r\nsea, both on the eastern and western coast, having subsided seven or\r\neight hundred feet during this tertiary period; the movement having\r\napparently been co-extensive, or nearly co-extensive, with the deposits\r\nof this age. Nor will I again give the facts and reasoning on which the\r\nproposition was founded, that when the bed of the sea is either\r\nstationary or rising, circumstances are far less favourable than when\r\nits level is sinking, to the accumulation of conchiferous deposits of\r\nsufficient thickness, extension, and hardness to resist, when upheaved,\r\nthe ordinary vast amount of denudation. We have seen that the highly\r\nremarkable fact of the absence of any EXTENSIVE formations containing\r\nrecent shells, either on the eastern or western coasts of the\r\ncontinent,—though these coasts now abound with living mollusca,—though\r\nthey are, and apparently have always been, as favourable for the\r\ndeposition of sediment as they were when the tertiary formations were\r\ncopiously deposited,—and though they have been upheaved to an amount\r\nquite sufficient to bring up strata from the depths the most fertile\r\nfor animal life—can be explained in accordance with the above\r\nproposition. As a deduction, it was also attempted to be shown, first,\r\nthat the want of close sequence in the fossils of successive\r\nformations, and of successive stages in the same formation, would\r\nfollow from the improbability of the same area continuing slowly to\r\nsubside from one whole period to another, or even during a single\r\nentire period; and secondly, that certain epochs having been favourable\r\nat distant points, in the same quarter of the world for the synchronous\r\naccumulation of fossiliferous strata, would follow from movements of\r\nsubsidence having apparently, like those of elevation,\r\ncontemporaneously affected very large areas.\r\n\r\nThere is another point which deserves some notice, namely, the analogy\r\nbetween the upper parts of the Patagonian tertiary formation, as well\r\nas of the upper possibly contemporaneous beds at Chiloe and Concepcion,\r\nwith the great gypseous formation of Cordillera; for in both\r\nformations, the rocks, in their fusible nature, in their containing\r\ngypsum, and in many other characters, show a connection, either\r\nintimate or remote, with volcanic action; and as the strata in both\r\nwere accumulated during subsidence, it appears at first natural to\r\nconnect this sinking movement with a state of high activity in the\r\nneighbouring volcanoes. During the cretaceo-oolitic period this\r\ncertainly appears to have been the case at the Puente del Inca, judging\r\nfrom the number of intercalated lava-streams in the lower 3,000 feet of\r\nstrata; but generally, the volcanic orifices seem at this time to have\r\nexisted as submarine solfataras, and were certainly quiescent compared\r\nwith their state during the accumulation of the porphyritic\r\nconglomerate formation. During the deposition of the tertiary strata we\r\nknow that at S. Cruz, deluges of basaltic lava were poured forth; but\r\nas these lie in the upper part of the series, it is possible that the\r\nsubsidence may at that time have ceased: at Chiloe, I was unable to\r\nascertain to what part of the series the pile of lavas belonged. The\r\nUspallata tuffs and great streams of submarine lavas, were probably\r\nintermediate in age between the cretaceo- oolitic and older tertiary\r\nformations, and we know from the buried trees that there was a great\r\nsubsidence during their accumulation; but even in this case, the\r\nsubsidence may not have been strictly contemporaneous with the great\r\nvolcanic eruptions, for we must believe in at least one intercalated\r\nperiod of elevation, during which the ground was upraised on which the\r\nnow buried trees grew. I have been led to make these remarks, and to\r\nthrow some doubt on the strict contemporaneousness of high volcanic\r\nactivity and movements of subsidence, from the conviction impressed on\r\nmy mind by the study of coral formations, that these two actions do not\r\ngenerally go on synchronously;—on the contrary, that in volcanic\r\ndistricts, subsidence ceases as soon as the orifices burst forth into\r\nrenewed action, and only recommences when they again have become\r\ndormant. (“The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs.”)\r\n\r\nAt a later period, the Pampean mud, of estuary origin, was deposited\r\nover a wide area,—in one district conformably on the underlying old\r\ntertiary strata, and in another district unconformably on them, after\r\ntheir upheaval and denudation. During and before the accumulation,\r\nhowever, of these old tertiary strata, and, therefore, at a very remote\r\nperiod, sediment, strikingly resembling that of the Pampas, was\r\ndeposited; showing during how long a time in this case the same\r\nagencies were at work in the same area. The deposition of the Pampean\r\nestuary mud was accompanied, at least in the southern parts of the\r\nPampas, by an elevatory movement, so that the M. Hermoso beds probably\r\nwere accumulated after the upheaval of those round the S. Ventana; and\r\nthose at P. Alta after the upheaval of the M. Hermoso strata; but there\r\nis some reason to suspect that one period of subsidence intervened,\r\nduring which mud was deposited over the coarse sand of the Barrancas de\r\nS. Gregorio, and on the higher parts of Banda Oriental. The mammiferous\r\nanimals characteristic of this formation, many of which differ as much\r\nfrom the present inhabitants of South America, as do the eocene mammals\r\nof Europe from the present ones of that quarter of the globe, certainly\r\nco-existed at B. Blanca with twenty species of mollusca, one balanus,\r\nand two corals, all now living in the adjoining sea: this is likewise\r\nthe case in Patagonia with the Macrauchenia, which co-existed with\r\neight shells, still the commonest kinds on that coast. I will not\r\nrepeat what I have elsewhere said, on the place of habitation, food,\r\nwide range, and extinction of the numerous gigantic mammifers, which at\r\nthis late period inhabited the two Americas.\r\n\r\nThe nature and grouping of the shells embedded in the old tertiary\r\nformations of Patagonia and Chile show us, that the continent at that\r\nperiod must have stood only a few fathoms below its present level, and\r\nthat afterwards it subsided over a wide area, seven or eight hundred\r\nfeet. The manner in which it has since been rebrought up to its actual\r\nlevel, was described in detail in the First and Second Chapters. It was\r\nthere shown that recent shells are found on the shores of the Atlantic,\r\nfrom Tierra del Fuego northward for a space of at least 1,180 nautical\r\nmiles, and at the height of about 100 feet in La Plata, and of 400 feet\r\nin Patagonia. The elevatory movements on this side of the continent\r\nhave been slow; and the coast of Patagonia, up to the height in one\r\npart of 950 feet and in another of 1,200 feet, is modelled into eight\r\ngreat, step-like, gravel-capped plains, extending for hundreds of miles\r\nwith the same heights; this fact shows that the periods of denudation\r\n(which, judging from the amount of matter removed, must have been long\r\ncontinued) and of elevation were synchronous over surprisingly great\r\nlengths of coasts. On the shores of the Pacific, upraised shells of\r\nrecent species, generally, though not always, in the same proportional\r\nnumbers as in the adjoining sea, have actually been found over a north\r\nand south space of 2,075 miles, and there is reason to believe that\r\nthey occur over a space of 2,480 miles. The elevation on this western\r\nside of the continent has not been equable; at Valparaiso, within the\r\nperiod during which upraised shells have remained undecayed on the\r\nsurface, it has been 1,300 feet, whilst at Coquimbo, 200 miles\r\nnorthward, it has been within this same period only 252 feet. At Lima,\r\nthe land has been uplifted at least 80 feet since Indian man inhabited\r\nthat district; but the level within historical times apparently has\r\nsubsided. At Coquimbo, in a height of 364 feet, the elevation has been\r\ninterrupted by five periods of comparative rest. At several places the\r\nland has been lately, or still is, rising both insensibly and by sudden\r\nstarts of a few feet during earthquake-shocks; this shows that these\r\ntwo kinds of upward movement are intimately connected together. For a\r\nspace of 775 miles, upraised recent shells are found on the two\r\nopposite sides of the continent; and in the southern half of this\r\nspace, it may be safely inferred from the slope of the land up to the\r\nCordillera, and from the shells found in the central part of Tierra del\r\nFuego, and high up the River Santa Cruz, that the entire breadth of the\r\ncontinent has been uplifted. From the general occurrence on both coasts\r\nof successive lines of escarpments, of sand-dunes and marks of erosion,\r\nwe must conclude that the elevatory movement has been normally\r\ninterrupted by periods, when the land either was stationary, or when it\r\nrose at so slow a rate as not to resist the average denuding power of\r\nthe waves, or when it subsided. In the case of the present high\r\nsea-cliffs of Patagonia and in other analogous instances, we have seen\r\nthat the difficulty in understanding how strata can be removed at those\r\ndepths under the sea, at which the currents and oscillations of the\r\nwater are depositing a smooth surface of mud, sand, and sifted pebbles,\r\nleads to the suspicion that the formation or denudation of such cliffs\r\nhas been accompanied by a sinking movement.\r\n\r\nIn South America, everything has taken place on a grand scale, and all\r\ngeological phenomena are still in active operation. We know how violent\r\nat the present day the earthquakes are, we have seen how great an area\r\nis now rising, and the plains of tertiary origin are of vast\r\ndimensions; an almost straight line can be drawn from Tierra del Fuego\r\nfor 1,600 miles northward, and probably for a much greater distance,\r\nwhich shall intersect no formation older than the Patagonian deposits;\r\nso equable has been the upheaval of the beds, that throughout this long\r\nline, not a fault in the stratification or abrupt dislocation was\r\nanywhere observable. Looking to the basal, metamorphic, and plutonic\r\nrocks of the continent, the areas formed of them are likewise vast; and\r\ntheir planes of cleavage and foliation strike over surprisingly great\r\nspaces in uniform directions. The Cordillera, with its pinnacles here\r\nand there rising upwards of twenty thousand feet above the level of the\r\nsea, ranges in an unbroken line from Tierra del Fuego, apparently to\r\nthe Arctic circle. This grand range has suffered both the most violent\r\ndislocations, and slow, though grand, upward and downward movements in\r\nmass; I know not whether the spectacle of its immense valleys, with\r\nmountain-masses of once liquified and intrusive rocks now bared and\r\nintersected, or whether the view of those plains, composed of shingle\r\nand sediment hence derived, which stretch to the borders of the\r\nAtlantic Ocean, is best adapted to excite our astonishment at the\r\namount of wear and tear which these mountains have undergone.\r\n\r\nThe Cordillera from Tierra del Fuego to Mexico, is penetrated by\r\nvolcanic orifices, and those now in action are connected in great\r\ntrains. The intimate relation between their recent eruptions and the\r\nslow elevation of the continent in mass, appears to me highly\r\nimportant, for no explanation of the one phenomenon can be considered\r\nas satisfactory which is not applicable to the other. (On the\r\nConnection of certain Volcanic Phenomena in South America: “Geological\r\nTransactions” volume 5 page 609.) The permanence of the volcanic action\r\non this chain of mountains is, also, a striking fact; first, we have\r\nthe deluges of submarine lavas alternating with the porphyritic\r\nconglomerate strata, then occasionally feldspathic streams and abundant\r\nmineral exhalations during the gypseous or cretaceo- oolitic period:\r\nthen the eruptions of the Uspallata range, and at an ancient but\r\nunknown period, when the sea came up to the eastern foot of the\r\nCordillera, streams of basaltic lava at the foot of the Portillo range;\r\nthen the old tertiary eruptions; and lastly, there are here and there\r\namongst the mountains, much worn and apparently very ancient volcanic\r\nformations without any craters; there are, also, craters quite extinct,\r\nand others in the condition of solfataras, and others occasionally or\r\nhabitually in fierce action. Hence it would appear that the Cordillera\r\nhas been, probably with some quiescent periods, a source of volcanic\r\nmatter from an epoch anterior to our cretaceo-oolitic formation to the\r\npresent day; and now the earthquakes, daily recurrent on some part of\r\nthe western coast, give little hope that the subterranean energy is\r\nexpended.\r\n\r\nRecurring to the evidence by which it was shown that some at least of\r\nthe parallel ridges, which together compose the Cordillera, were\r\nsuccessively and slowly upthrown at widely different periods; and that\r\nthe whole range certainly once, and almost certainly twice, subsided\r\nsome thousand feet, and being then brought up by a slow movement in\r\nmass, again, during the old tertiary formations, subsided several\r\nhundred feet, and again was brought up to its present level by a slow\r\nand often interrupted movement; we see how opposed is this complicated\r\nhistory of changes slowly effected, to the views of those geologists\r\nwho believe that this great mountain-chain was formed in late times by\r\na single blow. I have endeavoured elsewhere to show, that the\r\nexcessively disturbed condition of the strata in the Cordillera, so far\r\nfrom indicating single periods of extreme violence, presents\r\ninsuperable difficulties, except on the admission that the masses of\r\nonce liquified rocks of the axes were repeatedly injected with\r\nintervals sufficiently long for their successive cooling and\r\nconsolidation. (“Geological Transactions” volume 5 page 626.) Finally,\r\nif we look to the analogies drawn from the changes now in progress in\r\nthe earth’s crust, whether to the manner in which volcanic matter is\r\nerupted, or to the manner in which the land is historically known to\r\nhave risen and sunk: or again, if we look to the vast amount of\r\ndenudation which every part of the Cordillera has obviously suffered,\r\nthe changes through which it has been brought into its present\r\ncondition, will appear neither to have been too slowly effected, nor to\r\nhave been too complicated.\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nAs, both in France and England, translations of a passage in Professor\r\nEhrenberg’s Memoir, often referred to in the Fourth Chapter of this\r\nvolume, have appeared, implying that Professor Ehrenberg believes, from\r\nthe character of the infusoria, that the Pampean formation was\r\ndeposited by a sea-debacle rushing over the land, I may state, on the\r\nauthority of a letter to me, that these translations are incorrect. The\r\nfollowing is the passage in question:—\r\n\r\n“Durch Beachtung der mikroscopischen Formen hat sich nun feststellen\r\nlassen, das die Mastodonten-Lager am La Plata und die Knochen-Lager am\r\nMonte Hermoso, who wie die der Riesen-Gurtelthiere in den Dunenhugeln\r\nbei Bahia Blanca, beides in Patagonien, unveranderte brakische\r\nSusswasserbildungen sind, die einst wohl sammtlich zum obersten\r\nFluthgebiethe des Meeres im tieferen Festlande\r\ngehorten.”—“Monatsberichten der konigl.
