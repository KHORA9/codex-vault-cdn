They tell us who they were, and when and where\r\n    they lived.\"--_Louis Agassiz._\r\n\r\n\r\nDeep in the ground, and high and dry on the sides of mountains, belts of\r\nlimestone and sandstone and slate lie on the ancient granite ribs of the\r\nearth. They are the deposits of sand and mud that formed the shores of\r\nancient seas. The limestone is formed of the decayed shells of animal\r\nforms that flourished in shallow bays along those shores. And all we\r\nknow about the life of these early days is read in the epitaphs written\r\non these stone tables.\r\n\r\nUnder the stratified rocks, the granite foundations tell nothing of life\r\non the earth. But the sea rolled over them, and in it lived a great\r\nvariety of shellfish. Evidently the earliest fossil-bearing rocks were\r\nworn away, for the rocks that now lie on the granite show not the\r\nbeginnings, but the high tide of life. The \"lost interval\" of which\r\ngeologists speak was a time when living forms were few in the sea.\r\n\r\nIn the muddy bottoms of shallow, quiet bays lie the shells and skeletons\r\nof the creatures that live their lives in those waters and die when they\r\ngrow old and feeble. We have seen the fiddler crabs by thousands on\r\nsuch shores, young and old, lusty and feeble. We have seen the rocks\r\nalong another coast almost covered by the coiled shells of little gray\r\nperiwinkles, and big clumps of black mussels hanging on the piers and\r\nwharfs. All these creatures die, at length, and their shells accumulate\r\non the shallow sea bottom. Who has not spent hours gathering dead shells\r\nwhich the tide has thrown up on the beach? Who has not cut his foot on\r\nthe broken shells that lie in the sandy bottom we walk on whenever we go\r\ninto the surf to swim or bathe?\r\n\r\nRead downward from the surface toward the earth's centre--\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n  ------+----------------------+-----------+-----------------------\r\n  Part  | _Rock Systems_       | _Dominant | _Dominant Plants_\r\n        |                      | Animals_  |\r\n  ------+----------------------+-----------+-----------------------\r\n   VII. | Recent               | Man       | Flowering kinds\r\n        |{ Quaternary          |           |\r\n    VI. |           { Pliocene | Mammals   | Early flowering\r\n        |{ Tertiary { Miocene  |           |\r\n        |           { Eocene   |           |\r\n     V. | Mesozoic             | Reptiles  | Cycads\r\n    IV. | Carboniferous        | Amphibians| Ferns and Conifers\r\n   III. | Devonian             | Fishes    | Ferns\r\n    II. | Silurian             | Molluscs  | Seaweeds\r\n     I. | Fire-formed          | No life   | No life\r\n  ------+----------------------+-----------+-----------------------\r\n\r\nIt is by dying that the creatures of the sea write their epitaphs. The\r\nmud or sand swallows them up. In time these submerged banks may be left\r\ndry, and become beds of stone. Then some of the skeletons and shells\r\nmay be revealed in blocks of quarried stone, still perfect in form after\r\nlying buried for thousands of years.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of this great stone book are the layers of rock, laid down\r\nunder water. Between the leaves are pressed specimens--fossils of\r\nanimals and plants that have lived on the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FOSSIL FISH\r\n\r\n\r\nI remember seeing a flat piece of stone on a library table, with the\r\nskeleton of a fish distinctly raised on one surface. The friend who\r\nowned this strange-looking specimen told me that she found it in a stone\r\nquarry. She brought home a large piece of the slate, and a stone-mason\r\ncut out the block with the fish in it, and her souvenir made a useful\r\nand interesting paper-weight.\r\n\r\nThe story of that fish I heard with wonder, and have never forgotten. I\r\nhad never heard of fossil animals or plants until my good neighbour\r\ntalked about them. She showed me bits of stone with fern leaves pressed\r\ninto them. One piece of hard limestone was as full of little sea-shells\r\nas it could possibly be. One ball of marble was a honeycombed pattern,\r\nand called \"fossil coral.\"\r\n\r\nThe fossil fish was once alive, swimming in the sea, and feeding on the\r\nthings it liked to eat, as all happy fishes do. Near shore a river\r\npoured its muddy water into the sea, and the sandy bottom was covered\r\nwith the mud that settled on it. At last the fish grew old, and perhaps\r\na trifle stupid about catching minnows. It died, and sank to the muddy\r\nfloor of the sea. Its horny bones were not dissolved by the water. They\r\nremained, and the mud filtered in and filled all the spaces. Soon the\r\nfish was buried completely by the sediment the river brought.\r\n\r\nYears, thousands of them, went by, and the layer of mud was so thick and\r\nheavy above the skeleton of the fish that it bore a weight of tons\r\nthere, under the water. The close-packed mud became a stiff clay. After\r\nmore thousands of years, the sea no longer came so far ashore, for the\r\nriver had built up a great delta of land out of mud. The clay in which\r\nthe fish was hidden hardened into slate. Water crept down in the loose\r\nupper layers, dissolving out salt and other minerals, and having harder\r\nwork to soak through, the lower it went. The water left some of the\r\nminerals it had accumulated, calcium and silica and iron, in the lower\r\nrock beds, making them harder than they were before, and heavier and\r\nless porous.\r\n\r\nWhen the river gorge was cut through these layers of rock, the colour\r\nand thickness of each kind were laid bare. Centuries after, perhaps\r\nthousands of years, indeed, the quarrymen cut out the layers fit for\r\nbuilding stones, flags for walks and slates for roofing. In the\r\nsplitting of a flagstone, the long-buried skeleton of the fish came to\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nUnder our feet the earth lies in layers. Under the soil lie loose beds\r\nof clay and sand and gravel, and under these loose kinds of earth are\r\nclose-packed clays, sandstones, limestones, shales, often strangely\r\ntilted away from the horizontal line, but variously fitted, one layer to\r\nanother. Under these rocks lie the foundations of the earth--the\r\nfire-formed rocks, like granite. The depth of this original rock is\r\nunknown. It is the substance out of which the earth is made, we think.\r\nAll the layered rocks are made of particles of the older ones, stolen by\r\nwind and water, and finally deposited on the borders of lakes and seas.\r\nSo our rivers are doing to-day what they have always done--they are\r\ntearing down rocks, grinding and sifting the fragments, and letting them\r\nfall where the current of fresh water meets a great body of water that\r\nis still, or has currents contrary to that of the river.\r\n\r\nDo you see a little dead fish in the water? It is on the way to become a\r\nfossil, and the mud that sifts over it, to become a layer of slate.\r\nEvery seashore buries its dead in layers of sand and mud.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CRUST OF THE EARTH\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is hard to believe that our solid earth was once a ball of seething\r\nliquid, like the red-hot iron that is poured out of the big clay cups\r\ninto the sand moulds at an iron foundry. But when a mountain like\r\nVesuvius sets up a mighty rumbling, and finally a mass of white-hot lava\r\nbursts from the centre and streams down the sides, covering the\r\nvineyards and olive orchards, and driving the people out of their homes\r\nin terror, it seems as if the earth's crust must be but a thin and frail\r\naffair, covering a fiery interior, which might at any time break out.\r\nThe people who live near volcanoes might easily get this idea.\r\n\r\nBut they do not. They go back as soon as the lava streams are cooled,\r\nand rebuild their homes, and plant more orchards and vineyards. \"It is\r\n_so_ many years,\" say they to one another, \"since the last bad eruption.\r\nVesuvius will probably sleep now till we are dead and gone.\"\r\n\r\nThis is good reasoning. There are few active volcanoes left on the\r\nearth, compared with the number that were once active, and long ago\r\nbecame extinct. And the time between eruptions of the active ones grows\r\nlonger; the eruptions less violent. Terrible as were the recent\r\nearthquakes of San Francisco and Messina, this form of disturbance of\r\nthe earth's crust is growing constantly less frequent. The earth is\r\ngrowing cooler as it grows older; the crust thickens and grows stronger\r\nas centuries pass. We have been studying the earth only a few hundred\r\nyears. The crust has been cooling for millions of years, and\r\nmountain-making was the result of the shrinking of the crust. That\r\nformed folds and clefts, and let masses of the heated substance pour out\r\non the surface.\r\n\r\nMy first geography lesson I shall never forget. The new teacher had very\r\nbright eyes and _such_ pretty hands! She held up a red apple, and told\r\nus that the earth's substance was melted and burning, inside its crust,\r\nwhich was about as thick, in proportion to the size of the globe, as the\r\nskin of the apple. I was filled with wonder and fear. What if we\r\nchildren jumped the rope so hard as to break through the fragile shell,\r\nand drop out of sight in a sea of fiery metal, like melted iron? Some of\r\nthe boys didn't believe it, but they were impressed, nevertheless.\r\n\r\nThe theory of the heated interior of the earth is still believed, but\r\nthe idea that flames and bubbling metals are enclosed in the outer layer\r\nof solid matter has generally been abandoned. The power that draws all\r\nof its particles toward the earth's centre is stated by the laws of\r\ngravitation. The amount of \"pull\" is the measure of the weight of any\r\nsubstance. Lift a stone, and then a feather pillow, much larger than\r\nthe stone. One is strongly drawn to the earth; the other not. One is\r\n_heavy_, we say, the other _light_.\r\n\r\nIf a stone you can pick up is heavy, how much heavier is a great boulder\r\nthat it takes a four-horse team to haul. What tremendous weight there is\r\nin all the boulders scattered on a hillside! The hill itself could not\r\nbe made level without digging away thousands of tons of earth. The\r\nearth's outer crust, with its miles in depth of mountains and level\r\nground, is a crushing weight lying on the heated under-substance. Every\r\nfoot of depth adds greatly to the pressure exerted upon the mass, for\r\nthe attraction of gravitation increases amazingly as the centre of the\r\nearth is approached.\r\n\r\nIt is now believed that the earth is solid to its centre, though heated\r\nto a high degree. Terrific pressure, which causes this heat, is exerted\r\nby the weight of the crust. A crack in the crust may relieve this\r\npressure at some point, and a mass of substance may be forced out and\r\nburst into a flaming stream of lava. Such an eruption is familiar in\r\nvolcanic regions. The fact that red-hot lava streams from the crater of\r\nVesuvius is no proof that it was seething and bubbling while far below\r\nthe surface.\r\n\r\nVolcanoes, geysers, and hot springs prove that the earth's interior is\r\nhot. The crust is frozen the year around in the polar regions, and never\r\nbetween the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn. The sun's rays produce our\r\ndifferent climates, but they affect only the surface. Underground, there\r\nis a rise of a degree of temperature for every fifty feet one goes\r\ndown. The lowest mine shaft is about a mile deep. That is only one\r\nfour-thousandth of the distance to the earth's centre.\r\n\r\nBy an easy computation we could locate the known melting-point for\r\nmetals and other rock materials. But one degree for each fifty feet of\r\ndepth below the surface may not be correct for the second mile, as it is\r\nfor the first. Again, the melting-point is probably a great deal higher\r\nfor substances under great pressure. The weight of the crust is a burden\r\nthe under-rocks bear. Probably the pressure on every square inch reaches\r\nthousands of tons. Could any substance become liquid with such a weight\r\nupon it, whatever heat it attained? Nobody can answer this question.\r\n\r\nThe theory that volcanoes are chimneys connecting lakes of burning lava\r\nwith the surface of the earth is discredited by geologists. The weight\r\nof the overlying crust would, they think, close such chambers, and\r\nreduce liquids to a solid condition.\r\n\r\nSince the first land rose above the sea, the crust of the earth has\r\ngradually become more stable, but even now there is scarcely a day when\r\nthe instruments called seismographs do not record earthquake shocks in\r\nsome part of the earth; and the outbreaks of Vesuvius and Ætna, the\r\nconstant boiling of lava in the craters of the Hawaiian Islands and\r\nother volcanic centres, prove that even now the earth's crust is very\r\nthin and unstable. The further back in time we go, the thinner was the\r\ncrust, the more frequent the outbursts of volcanic activity, the more\r\nreadily did wrinkles form.\r\n\r\nThe shores of New Jersey and of Greenland are gradually sinking, and the\r\nsea coming up over the land. Certain parts of the world are gradually\r\nrising out of the sea. In earlier times the rising or the sinking of\r\nland over large areas happened much more frequently than now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT IS THE EARTH MADE OF?\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Baking day\" is a great institution in the comfortable farm life of the\r\nAmerican people. The big range oven is not allowed to grow cold until\r\nrows of pies adorn the pantry shelves, and cakes, tarts, and generous\r\nloaves of bread are added to the store. Cookies, perhaps, and a big pan\r\nfull of crisp, brown doughnuts often crown the day's work. No gallery of\r\nart treasures will ever charm the grown-up boys and girls as those\r\npantry shelves charmed the bright-eyed, hungry children, who were\r\nallowed to survey the treasure-house, and sample its good things while\r\nthey were still warm.\r\n\r\nYou could count a dozen different kinds of cakes and pies, rolls and\r\ncookies on those pantry shelves, yet several of them were made out of\r\nthe same dough. Instead of a loaf of bread, mother could make two or\r\nthree kinds of coffee cake, or cinnamon rolls, or currant buns, or\r\nParker-House rolls. Even the pastry, which made the pies and tarts, was\r\nnot so different from the bread dough, for each was made of flour, and\r\ncontained, besides the salt, \"shortening,\" which was butter or lard.\r\nSugar was used in everything, from the bread, which had a\r\ntable-spoonful, to the cookies, which were finished with a sifting of\r\nsugar on top.\r\n\r\nHow much of the food we eat is made of a very few staple\r\nfoodstuffs,--starch, sugar, fats! So in the wonderful earth and all that\r\ngrows out of it and lives upon it. Only seventy different elements have\r\nbeen discovered, counting, besides the earth, the water and the air, and\r\neven the strange wandering bodies, called meteorites, that fall upon the\r\nearth out of the sky. Like the flour in the different cakes and pies,\r\nthe element carbon is found in abundance and in strangely different\r\ncombinations. As a gas, in combination with oxygen, it is breathed out\r\nof our lungs, and out of chimneys where coal and wood are burned. It\r\nforms a large part of the framework of trees and other plants, and\r\nremains as charcoal when the wood is slowly burned under a close\r\ncovering. There is a good proportion of carbon in animal bodies, in the\r\nbones as well as the soft parts, and carbon is plentiful in the mineral\r\nsubstances of the earth.\r\n\r\nThe chemist is the man who has determined for us the existence and the\r\ndistribution of the seventy elements. He finds them in the solid\r\nsubstances of the globe and in the water that covers four-fifths of its\r\nsurface; in the atmosphere that covers sea and land, and in all the\r\nliving forms of plants and animals that live in the seas and on the\r\nland. By means of an instrument called the spectroscope, the heavenly\r\nbodies are proved to be made of the same substances that are found in\r\nthe rocks. The sun tells what it is made of, and one proof that the\r\nearth is a child of the sun is in the fact that the same elements are\r\nfound in the substance of both.\r\n\r\nOf the seventy elements, the most important are these: Oxygen, silicon,\r\naluminum, iron, manganese, calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium,\r\ncarbon, hydrogen, phosphorus, sulphur, chlorine, nitrogen.\r\n\r\n_Oxygen_ is the most plentiful and the most important element. One-fifth\r\nof the air we breathe is oxygen; one-third of the water we drink. The\r\nrock foundations of the earth are nearly one-half oxygen. No fire can\r\nburn, no plant or animal can grow, or even decay after it dies, unless\r\noxygen is present and takes an active part in each process. Strangely\r\nenough, this wonderful element is invisible. We open a window, and pure\r\nair, rich in oxygen, comes in and takes the place of the bad air but we\r\ncannot see the change. Water we see, but if the oxygen and the hydrogen\r\nwhich compose the colourless liquid were separated, each would become at\r\nonce an invisible gas. The oxygen of solid rocks exists only in\r\ncombination with other elements.\r\n\r\n_Silicon_ is the element which, united with oxygen, makes the rock\r\ncalled quartz. On the seashore the children are busy with their pails\r\nand shovels digging in the white, clean sand. These grains are of\r\nquartz,--fine crystals of a rock which forms nearly three-quarters of\r\nthe solid earth's substance. Not only in rocks, but out here in the\r\ngarden, the soil is full of particles of sand. You cannot get away from\r\nit.\r\n\r\n_Aluminum_ is a light, bluish-white metal which we know best in\r\nexpensive cooking utensils. It is more abundant even than iron, but\r\nprocesses of extracting it from the clay are still expensive. It is\r\noftenest found in combination with oxygen and silicon. While nearly\r\none-tenth of the earth's crust is composed of the metal aluminum,\r\nfour-fifths and more is composed of the minerals called silicates of\r\naluminum--oxygen, silicon, and aluminum in various combinations. It is\r\nmore plentiful than any other substance in rocks and in the clays and\r\nordinary soils, which are the finely ground particles of rock material.\r\n\r\n_Iron_ is one of the commonest of elements. We know it by its red\r\ncolour. A rusty nail is covered with oxide of iron, a combination which\r\nis readily formed wherever iron is exposed to the action of water or\r\nair. You have seen yellowish or red streaks in clefts of the rocks. This\r\nshows where water has dissolved out the iron and formed the oxide. The\r\nred colour of New Jersey soil is due to the iron it contains. Indeed,\r\nthe whole earth's crust is rich in iron which the water easily\r\ndissolves. The roots of plants take up quantities of iron in solution\r\nand this mounts to the blossoms, leaves, and fruit. The red or yellow\r\ncolour of autumn leaves, of apples, of strawberries, of tulips, and of\r\nroses, is produced by iron. The rosy cheeks of children are due to iron\r\nin the food they eat and in the water they drink. The doctor but follows\r\nthe suggestion of nature when he gives a pale and listless person a\r\ntonic of iron to make his blood red.\r\n\r\nIron is rarely found free, but it forms about five per cent. of the\r\ncrust of the earth, and it is believed to form at least one-fifth of the\r\nunknown centre of the earth, the bulk of the globe, the weight of which\r\nwe know, but concerning the substance of which we can say little that is\r\npositive.\r\n\r\n_Manganese_ is not a conspicuous element, but is found united with\r\noxygen in purplish or black streaks on the sides of rocks. It is\r\nsomewhat like iron, but much less common.\r\n\r\n_Calcium_ is the element that is the foundation of limestones. The\r\nskeletons and shells of animals are made of calcite, a common mineral\r\nformed by the uniting of carbon, oxygen, and calcium. Marbles are,\r\nperhaps, the most permanent form of the limestone rocks. \"Hard\" water\r\nhas filtered through rocks containing calcite, and absorbed particles of\r\nthis mineral. From water thus impregnated, all animal life on the earth\r\nobtains its bone-building and shell-building materials.\r\n\r\n_Carbon_ forms a large part of the tissues of plants and animals, and in\r\nthe remains of these it is chiefly found in the earth's crust. When\r\nthese burn or decay, the carbon remains as charcoal or escapes to the\r\nair in union with oxygen as the well known carbonic acid gas. This is\r\none of the most important foods of plants. Joined with calcium it forms\r\nthe mineral calcite, or carbonate of lime.\r\n\r\n_Hydrogen_ is one of the two gases that unite to form water. Oxygen is\r\nthe other. Many kinds of rock contain a considerable amount of water.\r\nSurface water sinks into porous soils and rocks, and accumulates in\r\npockets and veins which feed springs, and are the reserve water supply\r\nthat keeps our rivers flowing, even through dry weather. More water is\r\nheld by absorption in the earth's solid crust than in all the oceans and\r\nseas and great lakes.\r\n\r\nHydrogen, combined with carbon, occurs in solid rocks where the remains\r\nof plants and animals have slowly decayed. From such processes the\r\nso-called hydrocarbons, rock oil and natural gas, have accumulated. When\r\nsuch decay goes on above ground, these valuable products escape into the\r\nair. Marsh gas, whose feeble flame above decaying vegetation is the\r\nwill-o'-the-wisp of swamps, is an example.\r\n\r\n_Magnesium_, _potassium_, and _sodium_ are found in equal quantities in\r\nthe earth's crust, but never free. In union with chlorine, each forms a\r\nsoluble salt, and is thus found in water. Common salt, chloride of\r\nsodium, is the most abundant of these. Water dissolves salt out of the\r\nrocks, and carries it into the sea. Clouds that rise by the evaporation\r\nof ocean water leave the salt behind, hence the seas are becoming more\r\nand more salty, for the rivers carry salt to the oceans, which hold fast\r\nall they get.\r\n\r\n_Phosphorus_ is an element found united with oxygen in the tissues of\r\nboth plants and animals. It is most abundant in bones. Rocks containing\r\nfossil bones are rich in lime phosphates, which are important commercial\r\nfertilizers for enriching the soil. Beds of these rocks are found and\r\nmined in South Carolina and elsewhere.\r\n\r\n_Sulphur_ is well known as a yellow powder found most plentifully in\r\nrocks that are near volcanoes. It is a needed element in plant and\r\nanimal bodies. It occurs in rocks, united with many different elements.\r\nIn union with oxygen and a metal it forms the group of minerals called\r\nsulphates. In union with iron it forms sulphide of iron. The \"fool's\r\ngold\" which Captain John Smith's colonists found in the sand at\r\nJamestown, was this worthless iron pyrites.\r\n\r\n_Chlorine_ is a greenish, yellow gas, very heavy, and dangerous to\r\ninhale. If it gets into the lungs, it settles into the lowest levels,\r\nand one must stand on one's head to get it out. As an element of the\r\nearth's crust it is not very plentiful, but it is a part of all the\r\nchlorides of sodium, magnesium, and potassium. In salt, it forms two per\r\ncent. of the sea water. It is much less abundant in the rocks.\r\n\r\nTo these elements we might add _nitrogen_, that invisible gas which\r\nforms nearly four-fifths of our atmosphere, and is a most important\r\nelement of plant food in the soil. Most of the seventy elements are very\r\nrare. Many are metals, like gold and iron and silver. Some are not\r\nmetals. Some are solid. A few are liquid, like the metal mercury, and\r\nseveral are gaseous. Some are free and pure, and show no disposition to\r\nunite with others. Nuggets of gold are examples of this. Some exist only\r\nin union with other elements. This is the common rule among the\r\nelements. Changes are constantly going on. The elements are constantly\r\nabandoning old partnerships and forming new ones. Growth and decay of\r\nplant and animal life are but parts of the great programme of constant\r\nchange which is going on and has been in progress since the world\r\nbegan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST DRY LAND\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the earth's crust first formed it was still hot, though not so hot\r\nas when it was a mass of melted, glowing substance. As it moved through\r\nthe cold spaces of the sky, it lost more heat and its crust became\r\nthicker. At length the cloud masses became condensed enough to fall in\r\ntorrents of water, and a great sea covered all the land. This was before\r\nany living thing, plant or animal, existed on our planet. Can you\r\nimagine the continents and islands that form the land part of a map or\r\nglobe suddenly overwhelmed by the oceans, the names and boundaries of\r\nwhich you have taken such pains to learn in the study of geography? The\r\nglobe would be one blank of blue water, and geography would be\r\nabolished--and there would be nobody to study it. Possibly the fishes in\r\nthe sea might not notice any change in the course of their lives, except\r\nwhen they swam among the ruins of buried cities and peered into the\r\nwindows of high buildings, or wondered what new kind of seaweed it was\r\nwhen they came upon a submerged forest.\r\n\r\nIn that old time of the great sea that covered the globe, we are told\r\nthat there was a dense atmosphere over the face of the deep. So things\r\nwere shaping themselves for the far-off time when life should exist,\r\nnot only in the sea, where the first life did appear, but on land. But\r\nit took millions of years to fit the earth for living things.\r\n\r\nThe cooling of the earth made it shrink, and the crust began to be\r\nfolded into gentle curves, as the skin of a shrunken apple becomes\r\nwrinkled on the flesh. Some of these creases merely changed the depth of\r\nwater on the sea bottom; but one ridge was lifted above the water. The\r\nwater parted and streamed down its sloping sides, and a granite reef,\r\nwhich shone in the sunshine, became the first dry land. It lay east and\r\nwest, and stretched for many miles. It is still dry land and is a part\r\nof our own continent. Now it is but a small part of the country, but it\r\nis known by geologists, who can tell its boundaries, though newer land\r\njoins it on every side. It is named the Laurentian Hills, on geological\r\nmaps. Its southern border reaches along the northern boundary of the\r\nGreat Lakes to the head-waters of the Mississippi River.\r\n\r\nFrom this base, two ridges are lifted, forming a colossal V. One extends\r\nnortheast to Nova Scotia; the other northwest to the Arctic seas. The V\r\nencloses Hudson Bay.\r\n\r\nBesides this first elongated island of bare rocks, land appeared in a\r\nstrip where now the Blue Ridge Mountains stretch from New England to\r\nGeorgia. The other side of the continent lifted up two folds of the\r\ncrust above sea level. They are the main ridges of the Colorado and the\r\nWasatch Mountains. Possibly the main ridge of the Sierra Nevada rose\r\nalso at this time. The Ozark group of mountains, too, showed as a few\r\nisland peaks above the sea.\r\n\r\nThese first rocks were rapidly eaten away, for the atmosphere was not\r\nlike ours, but heavily charged with destructive gases, which did more,\r\nwe believe, to disintegrate the exposed rock surfaces than did the two\r\nother forces, wind and water, combined. The sediment washed down to the\r\nsea by rains, accumulated along the shores, filling the shallows and\r\nthus adding to the width of the land areas. The ancient granite ridge of\r\nthe Laurentian Hills is now low, and slopes gently. This is true of all\r\nvery old mountains. The newer ones are high and steep. It takes time to\r\ngrind down the peaks and carry off the waste material loosened by\r\nerosion.\r\n\r\nFar more material than could have been washed down the slopes of the\r\nfirst land ridges came directly from the interior of the earth, and\r\nspread out in vast, submarine layers upon the early crust. Volcanic\r\ncraters opened under water, and poured out liquid mineral matter, that\r\nflowed over the sea bottom before it cooled. Imagine the commotion that\r\nagitated the water as these submerged chimneys blew off their lids, and\r\ndischarged their fiery contents! It was long before the sea was cool\r\nenough to be the home of living things.\r\n\r\nThe layers of rock that formed under the sea during this period of the\r\nearth's history are of enormous thickness. They were four or five miles\r\ndeep along the Laurentian Hills. They broadened the original granite\r\nridge by filling the sea bottom along the shores. The backbones of the\r\nAppalachian system and the Cordilleras were built up in the same\r\nway--the oldest rocks were worn away, and their débris built up newer\r\nones in strata.\r\n\r\nWhen these layers of rock became dry land, the earth's crust was much\r\nmore stable and cool than it had ever been before. The vast\r\nrock-building of that era equals all that has been done since. The\r\nlayers of rocks formed since then do not equal the total thickness of\r\nthese first strata. So we believe that the time required to build those\r\nArchæan rock foundations equals or surpasses the vast period that has\r\nelapsed since the Archæan strata were formed.\r\n\r\nThe northern part of North America has grown around those old granite\r\nridges by the gradual rising of the shores. The geologist may walk along\r\nthe Laurentian Hills, that parted the waters into a northern and a\r\nsouthern ocean. He crosses the rocky beds deposited upon the granite;\r\nthen the successive beds formed as the land rose and the ocean receded.\r\nAge after age is recorded in the rocks. Gradually the sea is crowded\r\nback, and the land masses, east, west, and north, meet to form the\r\ncontinent. Nowhere on the earth are the steps of continental growth\r\nshown in unbroken sequence as they are in North America.\r\n\r\nHow long ago did those first islands appear above the sea? Nobody\r\nventures a definite answer to this question. No one has the means of\r\nknowing. But those who know most about it estimate that at the least one\r\nhundred million years have passed since then--one hundred thousand\r\nthousand years!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA STUDY OF GRANITE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Every village cemetery it is easy to find shafts of gray or speckled\r\ngranite, the polished surfaces of which show that the granite is made of\r\nsmall bits of different coloured minerals, cemented together into solid\r\nrock. Outside the gate you will usually find a place where monuments and\r\ngravestones may be bought. Here there is usually a stonecutter chipping\r\naway on a block with his graving tools. He is a man worth knowing, and\r\nbecause his work is rather monotonous he will probably be glad to talk\r\nto a chance visitor and answer questions about the different kinds of\r\nstone on which he works.\r\n\r\nThere are bits of granite lying about on the ground. If you have a\r\nhand-glass of low power, such as the botany class uses to examine the\r\nparts of flowers, it will be interesting to look through it and see the\r\nmagnified surface of a flake of broken granite. Here are bits of glassy\r\nquartz, clear and sparkling in the sun. Black and white may be all the\r\ncolours you make out in this specimen, or it may be that you see specks\r\nof pink, dark green, gray, and smoky brown, all cemented together with\r\nno spaces that are not filled. The particles of quartz are of various\r\ncolours, and are very hard. They scratch glass, and you cannot scratch\r\nthem with the steel point of your knife, as you can scratch the other\r\nminerals associated with the grains of quartz.\r\n\r\nGranite is made of quartz, feldspar, and mica, sometimes with added\r\nparticles of hornblende. Feldspar particles have as wide a range of\r\ncolour as quartz, but it is easy to tell the two apart. A knife will\r\nscratch feldspar, as it is not so hard as quartz. The crystals of\r\nfeldspar have smooth faces, while quartz breaks with a rough surface as\r\nglass does. Feldspar loses its glassy lustre when exposed to the\r\nweather, and becomes dull, with the soft lustre of pearl.\r\n\r\nMica may be clear and glassy, and it ranges in colour from transparency\r\nthrough various shades of brown to black. It has the peculiarity of\r\nsplitting into thin, leaf-like, flexible sheets, so it is easy to find\r\nout which particles in a piece of granite are mica. One has only to use\r\none's pocket knife with a little care. Hornblende is a dark mineral\r\nwhich contains considerable iron. It is found in lavas and granites,\r\nwhere it easily decays by the rusting of the iron. It is not unusual to\r\nsee a rough granite boulder streaked with dark red rust from this cause.\r\n\r\nThe crumbling of granite is constantly going on as a result of the\r\nexposure of its four mineral elements to the air. Quartz is the most\r\nstable and resistant to weathering. Soil water trickling over a granite\r\ncliff has little effect on the quartz particles; but it dissolves out\r\nsome of the silicon. The bits of feldspar are even more resistant to\r\nwater than quartz is, but the air causes them to decay rapidly, and\r\nfinally to fall away in a sort of mealy clay. Mica, like feldspar,\r\ndecays easily. Its substance is dissolved by water and carried away to\r\nbecome a kind of clay. The hornblende rusts away chiefly under the\r\ninfluence of moist air and trickling water.\r\n\r\nWe think of granite as a firm, imperishable kind of rock, and use it in\r\ngreat buildings like churches and cathedrals that are to stand for\r\ncenturies. But the faces that are exposed to the air suffer, especially\r\nin regions having a moist climate. The signs of decay are plainly\r\nvisible on the outer surfaces of these stones. Fortunate it is that the\r\nweathering process cannot go very deep.\r\n\r\nThe glassy polish on a smooth granite shaft is the silicon which acts as\r\na cement to bind all the particles together. It is resistant to the\r\nweather. A polished shaft will last longer than an unpolished one.\r\n\r\nGranites differ in colouring because the minerals that compose them, the\r\nfeldspars, quartzes, micas, and hornblendes, have each so wide a range\r\nof colour. Again, the proportions of the different mineral elements vary\r\ngreatly in different granites. A banded granite the colours of which\r\ngive it a stratified appearance is called a gneiss.\r\n\r\nWe have spoken before of the seventy elements found in the earth's\r\ncrust. A mineral is a union of two or more of these different elements;\r\nand we have found four minerals composing our granite rock. It may be\r\ninteresting to go back and inquire what elements compose these four\r\nminerals. Quartz is made of silicon and oxygen. Feldspar is made of\r\nsilicon, oxygen, and aluminum. Mica is made of silicon, oxygen, and\r\ncarbon, with some mingling of potassium and iron and other elements in\r\ndiffering proportions. Hornblende is made of silicon, oxygen, carbon,\r\nand iron.\r\n\r\nThe crumbling of a granite rock separates the minerals that compose it,\r\nreducing some to the condition of clay, others to grains of sand. Some\r\nof the elements let go their union and become free to form new unions.\r\nWater and wind gather up the fragments of crumbling granite and carry\r\nthem away. The feldspar and mica fragments form clay; the quartz\r\nfragments, sand. All of the sandstones and slates, the sand-banks and\r\nsand beaches, are made out of crumbled granite, the rocky foundations of\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMETAMORPHIC ROCKS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the dawn of life on the earth, soft-bodied creatures, lowest in the\r\nscale of being, inhabited the sea. The ancient volcanoes the\r\nsubterranean eruptions of which had spread layers of mineral substance\r\non the ocean floor, and heated the water to a high degree, had subsided.\r\nThe ocean was sufficiently cool to maintain life. The land was being\r\nworn down, and its débris washed into the ocean. The first sand-banks\r\nwere accumulating along sandy shores. The finer sediment was carried\r\nfarther out and deposited as mud-banks. These were buried under later\r\ndeposits, and finally, by the rising of the earth's crust, they became\r\ndry land. Time and pressure converted the sand-banks into sandstones;\r\nthe mud-banks into clay. The remains of living creatures utterly\r\ndisappeared, for they had no hard parts to be preserved as fossils.\r\n\r\nThe shrinking of the earth's crust had crumpled into folds of the utmost\r\ncomplexity those horizontal layers of lava rock poured out on the ocean\r\nfloor. Next, the same forces attacked the thick rock layers formed out\r\nof sediment--the aqueous or water-formed sandstones and clays.\r\n\r\nThe core of the globe contracts, and the force that crumples the crust\r\nto fit the core generates heat. The alkaline water in the rocks joins\r\nwith the heat produced by the crumpling and crushing forces, acting\r\ndownward, and from the sides, to transform pure sandstone into glassy\r\nquartzite, and clay into slate. In other words, water-formed rocks are\r\nbaked until they become fire-formed rocks. They are what the geologist\r\ncalls _metamorphic_, which means _changed_.\r\n\r\nIn many mountainous regions there are breaks through the strata of\r\nsandstone and slates and limestones, through which streams of lava have\r\npoured forth from the heated interior. Along the sides of these fissures\r\nthe hot lava has changed all the rocks it touched. The heat of the\r\nvolcanic rock matter has melted the silica in the sand, which has\r\nhardened again into a crystalline substance like glass.\r\n\r\nHave you ever visited a brick-yard? Here men are sifting clay dug out of\r\na pit or the side of a hill, adding sand from a sand-bank, and in a big\r\nmixing box, stirring these two \"dry ingredients\" with water into a thick\r\npaste. This dough is moulded into bricks, sun-dried, and then baked in\r\nkilns themselves built of bricks. At the end of the baking, the soft,\r\ndoughy clay block is transformed into a hard, glassy, or dull brick.\r\nFrom aqueous rock materials, fire has produced a metamorphic rock.\r\nVolcanic action is imitated in this common, simple process of\r\nbrickmaking.\r\n\r\nMilwaukee brick is made of clay that has no iron in it. For this reason\r\nthe bricks are yellow after baking. Most bricks are red, on account of\r\nthe iron in the clay, which is converted into a red oxide, or rust, by\r\nwater and heat.\r\n\r\nCommon flower pots and the tiles used in draining wet land are not\r\nglazed, as hard-burned bricks are. The baking of these clay things is\r\ndone with much less heat. They are left somewhat porous. But the tiles\r\nof roofs are baked harder, and get a surface glaze by the melting of the\r\nglassy particles of the sand.\r\n\r\nAs bricks vary in colour and quality according to the materials that\r\ncompose them, so the metamorphic rocks differ. The white sand one sees\r\non many beaches is largely quartz. This is the substance of pure, white\r\nsandstone. Metamorphism melts the silica into a glassy liquid cement;\r\nthe particles are bound close together on cooling. The rock becomes a\r\nwhite, granular quartzite, that looks like loaf sugar. If banded, it is\r\ncalled gneiss. Such rocks take a fine polish.\r\n\r\nPure limestone is also white and granular. When metamorphosed by heat,\r\nit becomes white marble. The glassy cement that holds the particles of\r\nlime carbonate shows as the glaze of the polished surface. It is silica.\r\nOne sees the same mineral on the face of polished granite.\r\n\r\nClays are rarely pure. Kaolin is a white clay which, when baked, becomes\r\nporcelain. China-ware is artificially metamorphosed kaolin. In the\r\nearly rocks the clay beds were transformed by heat into jasper and\r\nslates. In beds where clay mingled with sand, in layers, gneiss was\r\nformed. If mica is a prominent element, the metamorphic rock is easily\r\nparted into overlapping, scaly layers. It is a mica schist. If\r\nhornblende is the most abundant mineral, the same scaly structure shows\r\nin a dark rock called hornblende schist, rich in iron. A schist\r\ncontaining much magnesia is called serpentine.\r\n\r\nThe bricks of the wall, the tiles on the roof, the flower pots on the\r\nwindow sill, and the dishes on the breakfast table, are examples of\r\nmetamorphic rocks made by man's skill, by the use of fire and water\r\nacting on sand and clay. Pottery has preserved the record of\r\ncivilization, from the making of the first crude utensils by cave men to\r\nthe finest expression of decorative art in glass and porcelain.\r\n\r\nThe choicest material of the builder and the sculptor is limestone baked\r\nby the fires under the earth's crust into marble. The most enduring of\r\nall the rocks are the foundation granite, and the metamorphic rocks that\r\nlie next to them. Over these lie thick layers of sedimentary rocks laid\r\ndown by water. In them the record of life on the earth is written in\r\nfossils.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AIR IN MOTION\r\n\r\n\r\nMost of the beautiful things that surround us and make our lives full of\r\nhappiness appeal to one or more of our five senses. The green trees we\r\ncan see, the bird songs we hear, the perfume of honey-laden flowers we\r\nsmell, the velvety smoothness of a peach we feel, and its rich pulp we\r\ntaste. But over all and through all the things we see and feel and hear\r\nand taste and smell, is the life-giving air, that lies like a blanket,\r\nmiles in depth, upon the earth. The substance which makes the life of\r\nplants and animals possible is, when motionless, an invisible,\r\ntasteless, odourless substance, which makes no sound and is not\r\nperceptible to the touch.\r\n\r\nAir fills the porous substance of the earth's crust for a considerable\r\ndistance, and even the water has so much air in it that fishes are able\r\nto breathe without coming to the surface. It is not a simple element,\r\nlike gold, or carbon, or calcium, but is made up of several elements,\r\nchief among which are nitrogen and oxygen. Four-fifths of its bulk is\r\nnitrogen and one-fifth oxygen. There is present in air more or less of\r\nwatery vapour and of carbon dioxide, the gas which results from the\r\nburning or decay of any substance. Although no more than one per cent.\r\nof the air that surrounds us is water, yet this is a most important\r\nelement. It forms the clouds that bear water back from the ocean and\r\nscatter it in rain upon the thirsty land. Solid matter in the form of\r\ndust, and soot from chimneys, accumulates in the clouds and does a good\r\nwork in condensing the moisture and causing it to fall.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that the air reaches to a height of one hundred to two\r\nhundred miles above the earth's surface. If a globe six feet in diameter\r\nwere furnished with an atmosphere proportionately as deep as ours, it\r\nwould be about an inch in depth. At the level of the sea the air reaches\r\nits greatest density. Two miles above sea-level it is only two-thirds as\r\ndense. On the tops of high mountains, four or five miles above sea\r\nlevel, the air is so rarefied as to cause the blood to start from the\r\nnostrils and eyelids of explorers. The walls of the little blood-vessels\r\nare broken by the expansion of the air that is inside. At the sea-level\r\nair presses at the rate of fifteen pounds per square foot in all\r\ndirections. As one ascends to higher levels, the air pressure becomes\r\nless and less.\r\n\r\nThe barometer is the instrument by which the pressure of air is\r\nmeasured. A glass tube, closed at one end, and filled with mercury, the\r\nliquid metal often called quicksilver, is inverted in a cup of the same\r\nmetal, and so supported that the metal is free to flow between the two\r\nvessels. The pressure of air on the surface of the mercury in the cup is\r\nsufficient at the sea-level to sustain a column of mercury thirty\r\ninches high in the tube. As the instrument is carried up the side of a\r\nmountain the mercury falls in the tube. This is because the air pressure\r\ndecreases the higher up we go. If we should descend into the shaft of\r\nthe deepest mine that reaches below the sea level, the column of air\r\nsupported by the mercury in the cup would be a mile higher, and for this\r\nreason its weight would be correspondingly greater. The mercury would\r\nthus be forced higher in the tube than the thirty-inch mark, which\r\nindicates sea-level.\r\n\r\nAnother form of barometer often seen is a tube, the lower and open end\r\nof which forms a U-shaped curve. In this open end the downward pressure\r\nof the air rests upon the mercury and holds it up in the closed end,\r\nforcing it higher as the instrument is carried to loftier altitudes. At\r\nsea level a change of 900 feet in altitude makes a change of an inch in\r\nthe height of the mercury in the column. The glass tube is marked with\r\nthe fractions of inches, or of the metre if the metric system of\r\nmeasurements is used.\r\n\r\nIt is a peculiarity of air to become heated when it is compressed, and\r\ncooled when it is allowed to expand again. It is also true that when the\r\nsun rises, the atmosphere is warmed by its rays. This is why the hottest\r\npart of the day is near noon when the sun's rays fall vertically. The\r\nearth absorbs a great deal of the sun's heat in the daytime and through\r\nthe summer season. When it cools this heat is given off, thus warming\r\nthe surrounding atmosphere. In the polar regions, north and south, the\r\nair is far below freezing point the year round. In the region of the\r\nEquator it rarely falls below 90 degrees, a temperature which we find\r\nvery uncomfortable, especially when there is a good deal of moisture in\r\nthe air.\r\n\r\nIf we climb a mountain in Mexico, we leave the sultry valley, where the\r\nheat is almost unbearable, and very soon notice a change. For every\r\nthree hundred feet of altitude we gain there is a fall of one degree in\r\nthe temperature. Before we are half way up the slope we have left behind\r\nthe tropical vegetation, and come into a temperate zone, where the\r\nplants are entirely different from those in the lower valley. As we\r\nclimb, the vegetation becomes stunted, and the thermometer drops still\r\nlower. At last we come to the region of perpetual snow, where the\r\nclimate is like that of the frozen north.\r\n\r\nSo we see that the air becomes gradually colder as we go north or south\r\nfrom the Equator, and the same change is met as we rise higher and\r\nhigher from the level of the sea.\r\n\r\nIt is only when air is in motion that we can feel and hear it, and there\r\nare very few moments of the day, and days of the year, when there is not\r\na breeze. On a still day fanning sets the air in motion, and creates a\r\nminiature breeze, the sound of which we hear in the swishing of the fan.\r\nThe great blanket of air that covers the earth is in a state of almost\r\nconstant disturbance, because of the lightness of warm air and the\r\nheaviness of cold air. These two different bodies are constantly\r\nchanging places. For instance, the heated air at the Equator is\r\nconstantly being crowded upward by cold air which settles to the level\r\nof the earth. Cold streams of air flow to the Tropics from north and\r\nsouth of the Equator, and push upward the air heated by the sun.\r\n\r\nThis constant inrush of air from north and south forms a double belt of\r\nconstant winds. If the earth stood still, no doubt the direction would\r\nbe due north and due south for these winds; but the earth rotates\r\nrapidly from west to east upon its axis, carrying with it everything\r\nthat is securely fastened to the surface: the trees, the houses, etc.\r\nBut the air is not a part of the earth, not even so much as the seas,\r\nthe waters of which must stay in their proper basins, and be whirled\r\naround with other fixed objects. The earth whirls so rapidly that the\r\nwinds from north and south of the Equator lag behind, and thus take a\r\nconstantly diagonal direction. Instead of due south the northern belt of\r\ncold air drifts south-west and the southern belt drifts northwest. These\r\nare called the Trade Winds. Near the Equator they are practically east\r\nwinds.\r\n\r\nThe belt of trade winds is about fifty degrees wide. It swings northward\r\nin our summer and southward in our winter, its centre following the\r\nvertical position of the sun. Near the centre of the course which marks\r\nthe meeting of the northern with the southern winds is a \"Belt of\r\nCalms\" where the air draws upward in a strong draught. The colder air of\r\nthe trade winds is pushing up the columns of light, heated air. This\r\nstrip is known by sailors as \"the Doldrums,\" or \"the region of\r\nequatorial calms.\" Though never wider than two or three hundred miles,\r\nthis is a region dreaded by captains of sailing-vessels, for they often\r\nlie becalmed for weeks in an effort to reach the friendly trade winds\r\nthat help them to their desired ports. Vessels becalmed are at the mercy\r\nof sudden tempests which come suddenly like thunder-storms, and\r\nsometimes do great damage to vessels because they take the sailors\r\nunawares and allow no time to shorten sail.\r\n\r\nUntil late years the routes of vessels were charted so that sailors\r\ncould take advantage of the trade winds in their long voyages. It was\r\nnecessary in the days of sailing-vessels for the captain to understand\r\nthe movements of winds which furnished the motive power that carried his\r\nvessel. Fortunate it was for him that there were steady winds in the\r\ntemperate zones that he could take advantage of in latitudes north of\r\nthe Tropic of Cancer and south of the Tropic of Capricorn. What becomes\r\nof the hot air that rises in a constant stream above the \"Doldrums,\"\r\npushed up by the cooler trade winds that blow in from north and south?\r\nNaturally this air cannot ascend very high, for it soon reaches an\r\naltitude in which its heat is rapidly lost, and it would sink if it\r\nwere not constantly being pushed by the rising column of warm air under\r\nit. So it turns and flows north and south at a level above the trade\r\nwinds. Not far north of the Tropic of Cancer it sinks to the level of\r\nsea and land, and forms a belt of winds that blows ships in a\r\nnortheasterly direction. Between trades and anti-trades is another zone\r\nof calms,--near the Tropics of Cancer and of Capricorn.\r\n\r\nThe land masses of the continents with their high mountain ranges\r\ninterfere with these winds, especially in the northern hemisphere, but\r\nin the Southern Pacific and on the opposite side of the globe the\r\n\"Roaring Forties,\" as these prevailing westerly winds are known by the\r\nsailors, have an almost unbroken waste of seas over which they blow. In\r\nthe long voyages between England and Australia, and in the Indian trade,\r\nthe ships of England set their sails to catch the roaring forties both\r\ngoing and coming. They accomplish this by sailing past the Cape of Good\r\nHope on the outward voyage and coming home by way of Cape Horn, thus\r\ncircling the globe with every trip. In the North Atlantic, traffic is\r\nnow mostly carried on in vessels driven by engines, not by sails. Yet\r\nthe westerly winds that blow from the West Indies diagonally across the\r\nAtlantic are still useful to all sailing craft that are making for\r\nBritish ports.\r\n\r\nFrom the north and from the south cold air flows down into the regions\r\nof warmer climate. These polar winds are not so important to sea\r\ncommerce, but they do a great work in tempering the heat in the\r\nequatorial regions. We cannot know how much our summers are tempered by\r\nthe cool breath of winds that blow over polar ice-fields. And the cold\r\nregions of the earth, in their brief summer, enjoy the benefits of the\r\nwarm breezes that flow north and south from the heated equatorial\r\nregions.\r\n\r\nThe land, north and south, is made habitable by the clouds. They gather\r\ntheir burdens of vapour from the warm seas, the wind drifts them north\r\nand south, where they let it fall in rains that make and keep the earth\r\ngreen and beautiful. From the clouds the earth gathers, like a great\r\nsponge, the water that stores the springs and feeds rivers and lakes.\r\nHow necessary are the winds that transport the cloud masses!\r\n\r\nThe air is the breath of life to all living things on our planet. Mars\r\nis one of the sun's family so provided. Plants or animals could probably\r\nlive on the planet Mars. Do we think often enough of this invisible,\r\nlife-giving element upon which we depend so constantly?\r\n\r\nThe open air which the wind purifies by keeping it in motion is the best\r\nplace in which to work, to play, and to sleep, when work and play are\r\ndone and we rest until another day comes. Indoors we need all the air we\r\ncan coax to come in through windows and doors. Fresh air purifies air\r\nthat is stale and unwholesome from being shut up. Nobody is afraid,\r\nnowadays, to breathe night air! What a foolish notion it was that led\r\npeople to close their bedroom windows at night. Clean air, in plenty,\r\nday and night, we need. Air and sunshine are the two best gifts of God.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WORK OF THE WIND\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the March wind comes blustering down the street, rudely dashing a\r\ncloud of dust in our faces, we are uncomfortable and out of patience. We\r\nduck our heads and cover our faces, but even then we are likely to get a\r\ncinder in one eye, to swallow germs by the dozens, and to get a gray\r\ncoating of plain, harmless dust. We welcome the rain that lays the dust,\r\nor its feeble imitation, the water sprinkler, that brings us temporary\r\nrelief.\r\n\r\nOn the quietest day, even after a thorough sweeping and dusting of the\r\nlibrary, you are able to write your name plainly on the film of dust\r\nthat lies on the polished table. Take a book from the open shelves, and\r\nblow into the trough of its top. This is always dusty. Where does the\r\ndust come from? This is the house-keeper's riddle.\r\n\r\nThe answer is not a hard one. I look out of my window on a street which\r\nis famous as the road Washington took on his retreat from White Plains\r\nto Trenton. It has always been the main thoroughfare between New York\r\nand Philadelphia, and now is the route that automobiles follow. A\r\nconstant procession of vehicles passes my house, and to-day each one\r\napproaches in a cloud of dust. The air is gray with suspended particles\r\nof dirt. The wind carries the successive clouds, and they roll up\r\nagainst the houses like breakers on the beach. Windows and doors are\r\nloose enough to let dust sift in. When a door opens, the cloud enters\r\nand lights on rugs and carpets and curtains. Any ledge collects its\r\nshare of dust. The beating of carpets and rugs disturbs the accumulated\r\ndust of many months.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: In this lonely Arizona desert the wind drifts the sand\r\ninto dunes, just as it does on the toe of Cape Cod]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Grand Canyon of the Colorado shows on a magnificent\r\nscale the work of water in cutting away rock walls]\r\n\r\nThe wind sweeps the ploughed field, and takes all the dust it can carry.\r\nIt blows the finest top soil from our gardens into the street. It blows\r\nsoil from other fields and gardens into ours, so the level of our land\r\nis not noticeably lowered. The wind strips the high land and drops its\r\nburden on lower levels. This is one of the big jobs the water has to do,\r\nand the wind is a valuable helper. To tear down the mountains and fill\r\nin the valleys is the great work of the two partners, wind and water.\r\n\r\nDead, still air holds the finest dust, without letting it fall. The\r\nbuoyancy of the particles overcomes their weight. We see them in a\r\nsunbeam, like shining points of precious metal, and watch them. A light\r\nbreeze picks up bits of soil and litter, from the smallest up to a\r\ncertain size and weight. If the velocity of the wind increases, its\r\ncarrying power increases. It is able to carry bits that are larger and\r\nheavier. The following table is exact and interesting:\r\n\r\n                      _Velocity_      _Pressure_\r\n                      _in Miles_      _in Pounds_\r\n                      _per Hour_     _per Sq. Ft._\r\n\r\n  Light breeze              14                   1\r\n  Strong breeze             42                   9\r\n  Strong gale               70                  25\r\n  Hurricane                 84                  36\r\n\r\nThe terrible paths of hurricanes are seen in forest countries. The trees\r\nare uprooted, as if a great roller had crushed them, throwing the tops\r\nall in one direction, and leaving the roots uncovered, and a sunken\r\npocket where each tree stood. On a steep, rocky slope, the uprooting of\r\nscattered trees often loosens tons of rock, and sends the mass\r\nthundering down the mountain-side. Much more destruction may be\r\naccomplished by one brief tornado than by years of wear by ordinary\r\nbreezes.\r\n\r\nThe wind does much to help the waves in their patient beating on rocky\r\nshores. If the wind blows from the ocean and the tide is landward, the\r\ntwo forces combine, and the loose rocks are thrown against the solid\r\nbeach with astonishing force. Even the gravel and the sharp sand are\r\ntools of great usefulness to the waves in grinding down the resisting\r\nshore. Up and back they are swept by the water, and going and coming\r\nthey have their chance to scratch or strike a blow. Boulders on the\r\nbeach become pockmarked by the constant sand-blast that plays upon them.\r\nThe lower windows of exposed seaside houses are dimmed by the sand that\r\npicks away the smooth surface outside, making it ground glass by the\r\nsame process used in the factory. Lighthouses have this difficulty in\r\nkeeping their windows clear. The \"lantern\" itself is sometimes reached\r\nby the sand grains. That is the cupola in which burns the great light\r\nthat warns vessels away from the rocks and tells the captain where he\r\nis.\r\n\r\nIn the Far Western States the telegraph poles and fence posts are soon\r\ncut off at the ground by the flinty knives the wind carries. These are\r\nthe grains of sand that are blown along just above the ground. The trees\r\nare killed by having their bark girdled in this way. The sand-storms\r\nwhich in the orange and lemon region of California are called \"Santa\r\nAnas\" sometimes last two or three days, and damage the trees by piercing\r\nthe tender bark with the needle-pointed sand.\r\n\r\nWind-driven soil, gathered from the sides of bare hills and mountains,\r\nfills many valleys of China with a fine, hard-packed material called\r\n\"loess.\" In some places it is hundreds of feet deep. The people dig into\r\nthe side of a hill of this loess and carry out the diggings, making\r\nthemselves homes, of many rooms, with windows, doors, and solid walls\r\nand floors, all in one solid piece, like the chambered house a mole\r\nmakes underground in the middle of a field. So compact is the loess that\r\nthere is no danger of a cave-in.\r\n\r\nThe hills of sand piled up on the southern shore of Lake Michigan, and\r\nat Provincetown, at the toe of Cape Cod, are the work of the wind. On\r\nalmost any sandy shore these \"dunes\" are common. The long slope is\r\ntoward the beach that furnishes the sand. The wind does the building. Up\r\nthe slope it climbs, then drops its burden, which slides to the bottom\r\nof an abrupt landward steep. There is a gradual movement inland if the\r\nstrongest winds come from the water. The shifting of the dunes threatens\r\nto cover fertile land near them. In the desert regions, the border-land\r\nis always in danger of being taken back again, even though it has been\r\nreclaimed from the desert and cultivated for long years.\r\n\r\nBesides tearing down, carrying away, and building up again the fragments\r\nof the earth's crust, the wind does much that makes the earth a pleasant\r\nplanet to live on. It drives the clouds over the land, bringing rains\r\nand snows and scattering them where they will bless the thirsty ground\r\nand feed the springs and brooks and rivers. It scatters the seeds of\r\nplants, and thus plants forests and prairies and lovely mountain slopes,\r\nmaking the wonderful wild gardens that men find when they first enter\r\nand explore a new region. The trade winds blow the warm air of the\r\nTropics north and south, making the climate of the northern countries\r\nmilder than it would otherwise be. Sea winds blow coolness over the land\r\nin summer, and cool lake breezes temper the inland regions. From the\r\nsnow-capped mountains come the winds that refresh the hot, tired worker\r\nin the valleys.\r\n\r\nEverywhere the wind blows, the life-giving oxygen is carried. This is\r\nwhat we mean when we speak of fresh air. Stagnant air is as unwholesome\r\nas stagnant water. Constant moving purifies both. So we must give the\r\nwind credit for some of the greatest blessings that come into our lives.\r\nLight and warmth come from the sun. Pure water and pure air are gifts\r\nthe bountiful earth provides. Without them there would be no life on the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRAIN IN SUMMER\r\n\r\n\r\n    How beautiful is the rain!\r\n    After the dust and heat,\r\n    In the broad and fiery street,\r\n    In the narrow lane,\r\n    How beautiful is the rain!\r\n\r\n    How it clatters along roofs,\r\n    Like the tramp of hoofs!\r\n    How it gushes and struggles out\r\n    From the throat of the overflowing spout!\r\n    Across the window-pane\r\n\r\n    It pours and pours;\r\n    And swift and wide,\r\n    With a muddy tide,\r\n    Like a river down the gutter roars\r\n    The rain, the welcome rain!\r\n\r\n    The sick man from his chamber looks\r\n    At the twisted brooks;\r\n    He can feel the cool\r\n    Breath of each little pool;\r\n    His fevered brain\r\n    Grows calm again,\r\n    And he breathes a blessing on the rain.\r\n\r\n                 --HENRY W. LONGFELLOW.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT BECOMES OF THE RAIN?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe clouds that sail overhead are made of watery vapour. Sometimes they\r\nlook like great masses of cotton-wool against the intense blue of the\r\nsky. Sometimes they are set like fleecy plumes high above the earth.\r\nSometimes they hang like a sullen blanket of gray smoke, so low they\r\nalmost touch the roofs of the houses. Indeed, they often rest on the\r\nground and then we walk through a dense fog.\r\n\r\nIn their various forms, clouds are like wet sponges, and when they are\r\nwrung dry they disappear--all their moisture falls upon the earth. When\r\nthe air is warm, the water comes in the form of rain. If it is cold, the\r\ndrops are frozen into hail, sleet, or snow.\r\n\r\nAll of the water in the oceans, in the lakes and rivers, great and\r\nsmall, all over the earth, comes from one source, the clouds. In the\r\ncourse of a year enough rain and snow fall to cover the entire surface\r\nof the globe to a depth of forty inches. This quantity of water amounts\r\nto 34,480 barrels on every acre. What becomes of it all?\r\n\r\nWe can easily understand that all the seas and the other bodies of water\r\nwould simply add forty inches to their depth, and many would become\r\nlarger, because the water would creep up on their gradually sloping\r\nshores. We have to account for the rain and the snow that fall upon the\r\ndry land and disappear.\r\n\r\nGo out after a drenching rainstorm and look for the answer to this\r\nquestion. The gullies along the street are full of muddy, running water.\r\nThere are pools of standing water on level places, but on every slope\r\nthe water is hurrying away. The ground is so sticky that wagons on\r\ncountry roads may mire to the hubs in the pasty earth. There is no use\r\nin trying to work in the garden or to mow the lawn. The sod is soft as a\r\ncushion, and the garden soil is water-soaked below the depth of a\r\nspading-fork.\r\n\r\nThe sun comes out, warm and bright, and the flagstones of the sidewalk\r\nsoon begin to steam like the wooden planks of the board walk. The sun is\r\nchanging the surface water into steam which rises into the sky to form a\r\npart of another bank of clouds. The earth has soaked up quantities of\r\nthe water that fell. If we followed the racing currents in the gullies\r\nwe should find them pouring into sewer mains at various points, and from\r\nthese underground pipes the water is conducted to some outlet like a\r\nriver. All of the streams are swollen by the hundreds of brooks and\r\nrivulets that are carrying the surface water to the lowest level.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Rain and wind are the sculptors that have carved these\r\nstrange castles out of a rocky table]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: All the water in the seas, lakes, rivers, and springs\r\ncame out of the clouds]\r\n\r\nSo we can see some of the rainfall going back to the sky, some running\r\noff through rivulets to the sea, and some soaking into the ground. It\r\nwill be interesting to follow this last portion as it gradually settles\r\ninto the earth. The soil will hold a certain quantity, for it is made up\r\nof fine particles, all separated by air spaces, and it acts like a\r\nsponge. In seasons of drought and great heat the sun will draw this soil\r\nwater back to the surface, by forming cracks in the earth, and fine,\r\nhair-like tubes, through which the vapour may easily rise. The gardener\r\nhas to rake the surface of the beds frequently to stop up these channels\r\nby which the sun is stealing the precious moisture.\r\n\r\nThe water that the surface soil cannot absorb sinks lower and lower into\r\nthe ground. It finds no trouble to settle through layers of sand, for\r\nthe particles do not fit closely together. It may come to a bed of clay\r\nwhich is far closer. Here progress is retarded. The water may\r\naccumulate, but finally it will get through, if the clay is not too\r\nclosely packed. Again it may sink rapidly through thick beds of gravel\r\nor sand. Reaching another bed of clay which is stiffer by reason of the\r\nweight of the earth above it, the water may find that it cannot soak\r\nthrough. The only way to pass this clay barrier is to fill the basin,\r\nand to trickle over the edge, unless a place is found in the bottom\r\nwhere some looser substance offers a passage. Let us suppose that a\r\nconcave clay basin of considerable depth is filled with water-soaked\r\nsand. At the very lowest point on the edge of this basin a stream will\r\nslowly trickle out, and will continue to flow, as long as water from\r\nabove keeps the bowl full.\r\n\r\nIt is not uncommon to find on hillsides, in many regions, little brooks\r\nwhose beginnings are traceable to springs that gush out of the ground.\r\nThe spring fills a little basin, the overflow of which is the brook. If\r\nthe source of this spring could be traced underground, we might easily\r\nfollow it along some loose rock formation until we come to a clay basin\r\nlike the one described above. We might have to go down quite a distance\r\nand then up again to reach the level of this supply, but the level of\r\nthe water at the mouth of the spring can never be higher than the level\r\nof the water in the underground supply basin.\r\n\r\nOften in hot summers springs \"go dry.\" The level of water in the supply\r\nbasin has fallen below the level of the spring. We must wait until\r\nrainfall has added to the depth of water in the basin before we can\r\nexpect any flow into the pool which marks the place where the brook\r\nbegins.\r\n\r\nSuppose we had no beds of clay, but only sand and gravel under the\r\nsurface soil. We should then expect the water to sink through this loose\r\nmaterial without hindrance, and, finding its way out of the ground, to\r\nflow directly into the various branches of the main river system of our\r\nregion. After a long rain we should have the streams flooded for a few\r\ndays, then dry weather and the streams all low, many of them entirely\r\ndry until the next rainstorm.\r\n\r\nInstead of this, the soil to a great depth is stored with water which\r\ncannot get away, except by the slow process by which the springs draw\r\nit off. This explains the steady flow of rivers. What should we do for\r\nwells if it were not for the water basins that lie below the surface? A\r\nshallow well may go dry. Its owner digs deeper, and strikes a lower\r\n\"vein\" of water that gives a more generous supply. In the regions of the\r\ncountry where the drift soil, left by the great ice-sheet, lies deepest,\r\nthe glacial boulder clay is very far down. The surface water, settling\r\nfrom one level to another, finally reaches the bottom of the drift.\r\nWells have to be deep that reach this water bed.\r\n\r\nThe water follows the slope of this bed and is drained into the ocean,\r\nsometimes by subterranean channels, because the bed of the nearest river\r\nis on a much higher level. So we must not think that the springs contain\r\nonly the water that feeds the rivers. They contain more.\r\n\r\nThe layers of clay at different levels, from the surface down to the\r\nbottom of the drift, form water basins and make it possible for people\r\nto obtain a water supply without the expense of digging deep wells. The\r\nclayey subsoil, only a few feet below the surface, checks the downward\r\ncourse of the water, so that the sun can gradually draw it back, and\r\nkeep a supply where plant roots can get it. The vapour rising keeps the\r\nair humid, and furnishes the dew that keeps all plant life comfortable\r\nand happy even through the hot summer months.\r\n\r\nUnder the drift lie layers of stratified rock, and under these are the\r\ngranites and other fire-formed rocks, the beginning of those rock masses\r\nwhich form the solid bulk of the globe. We know little about the core of\r\nthe earth, but the granites that are exposed in mountain ridges are\r\nfound to have a great capacity for absorbing water, so it is not\r\nunlikely that much surface water soaks into the rock foundations and is\r\nnever drained away into the sea.\r\n\r\nThe water in our wells is often hard. It becomes so by passing through\r\nstrata of soil and rock made, in part, at least, of limestone, which is\r\nreadily dissolved by water which contains some acid. Soil water absorbs\r\nacids from the decaying vegetation,--the dead leaves and roots of\r\nplants. Rain water is soft, and so is the water in ponds that have muddy\r\nbasins, destitute of lime. Water in the springs and wells of the\r\nMid-Western States is \"hard\" because it percolates through limestone\r\nmaterial. In many parts of this country the well water is \"soft,\"\r\nbecause of the scarcity of limestone in the soil.\r\n\r\nI have seen springs around which the plants and the pebbles were coated\r\nwith an incrustation of lime. \"Petrified moss\" is the name given to the\r\nplants thus turned to stone. The reason for this deposit is clear.\r\nUnderground water is often subjected to great pressure, and at this time\r\nit is able to dissolve much more of any mineral substance than under\r\nordinary conditions. When the pressure is released, the water is unable\r\nto hold in solution the quantity of mineral it contains; therefore, as\r\nit flows out through the mouth of the spring, the burden of mineral is\r\nlaid down. The plants coated with the lime gradually decay, but their\r\nforms are preserved.\r\n\r\nThere are springs the water of which comes out burdened with iron, which\r\nis deposited as a yellowish or red mineral on objects over which it\r\nflows. Ponds fed by these springs accumulate deposits of the mineral in\r\nthe muddy bottoms. Some of the most valuable deposits of iron ore have\r\naccumulated in bogs fed by iron-impregnated spring water. In a similar\r\nway lime deposits called marl or chalk are made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SOIL IN FIELDS AND GARDENS\r\n\r\n\r\nCity and country teachers are expected to teach classes about the\r\nformation and cultivation of soil. It is surprising how much of the\r\nneeded materials can be brought in by the children, even in the cities.\r\nThe beginning is a flowering plant growing in a pot. A window box is a\r\nsmall garden. A garden plot is a miniature farm.\r\n\r\n_Materials to collect for study indoors._ A few pieces of different\r\nkinds of rock: Granite, sandstone, slate; gravelly fragments of each,\r\nand finer sand. Pebbles from brooks and seashore. Samples of clays of\r\ndifferent colors, and sands. Samples of sandy and clay soils, black pond\r\nmuck, peat and coal. Rock fossils. A box of moist earth with earthworms\r\nin it. _Keep it moist._ A piece of sod, and a red clover plant with the\r\nsoil clinging to its roots.\r\n\r\n_What is soil?_ It is the surface layer of the earth's crust, sometimes\r\ntoo shallow on the rocks to plough, sometimes much deeper. Under deep\r\nsoil lies the \"subsoil,\" usually hard and rarely ploughed.\r\n\r\n_What is soil made of?_ Ground rock materials and decayed remains of\r\nanimal and plant life. By slow decay the soil becomes rich food for the\r\ngrowing of new plants. Wild land grows up to weeds and finally to\r\nforests. The soil in fields and gardens is cultivated to make it\r\nfertile. Plants take fertility from the soil. To maintain the same\r\nrichness, plant food must be put back into the soil. This is done by\r\ndeep tillage, and by mixing in with the soil manures, green crops, like\r\nclover, and commercial fertilizers.\r\n\r\n_Plants must be made comfortable, and must be fed._ Few plants are\r\ncomfortable in sand. It gets hot, it lets water through, and it shifts\r\nin wind and is a poor anchor for roots. Clay is so stiff that water\r\ncannot easily permeate it; roots have the same trouble to penetrate it\r\nand get at the food it is rich in. Air cannot get in.\r\n\r\nSand mixed with clay makes a mellow soil, which lets water and air pass\r\nfreely through. The roots are more comfortable, and the tiny root hairs\r\ncan reach the particles of both kinds of mineral food. But the needful\r\nthird element is decaying plant and animal substances, called \"humus.\"\r\nThese enrich the soil, but they do a more important thing: their decay\r\nhastens the release of plant food from the earthy part of the soil, and\r\nthey add to it a sticky element which has a wonderful power to attract\r\nand hold the water that soaks into the earth.\r\n\r\n_What is the best garden soil?_ A mixture of sand, clay, and humus is\r\ncalled \"loam.\" If sand predominates, it is a sandy loam--warm, mellow\r\nsoil. If clay predominates, we have a clay loam--a heavy, rich, but\r\ncool soil. All gradations between the two extremes are suited to the\r\nneeds of crops, from the melons on sandy soil, to celery that prefers\r\ndeep, cool soil, and cranberries that demand muck--just old humus.\r\n\r\n_How do plant roots feed in soil?_ By means of delicate root hairs which\r\ncome into contact with particles of soil around which a film of soil\r\nwater clings. This fluid dissolves the food, and the root absorbs the\r\nfluid. Plants can take no food in solid form. Hence it is of the\r\ngreatest importance to have the soil pulverized and spongy, able to\r\nabsorb and hold the greatest amount of water. The moisture-coated soil\r\nparticles must have air-spaces between them. Air is as necessary to the\r\nroots as to the tops of growing plants.\r\n\r\n_Why does the farmer plough and harrow and roll the land?_ To pulverize\r\nthe soil; to mellow and lighten it; to mix in thoroughly the manure he\r\nhas spread on it, and to reach, if he can, the deeper layers that have\r\nplant food which the roots of his crops have not yet touched. Killing\r\nweeds is but a minor business, compared with tillage.\r\n\r\nLater, ploughing or cultivating the surface lightly not only destroys\r\nthe weeds, but it checks the loss of water by evaporation from the\r\ncracks that form in dry weather. Raking the garden once a day in dry\r\nweather does more good than watering it. The \"dust mulch\" acts as a cool\r\nsunguard over the roots.\r\n\r\n_The process of soil-making._ If the man chopping wood in the Yosemite\r\nValley looks about him he can see the soil-making forces at work on a\r\ngrand scale. The bald, steep front of El Capitan is of the hardest\r\ngranite, but it is slowly crumbling, and its fragments are accumulating\r\nat the bottom of the long slope. Rain and snow fill all crevices in the\r\nrocks. Frost is a wonderful force in widening these cracks, for water\r\nexpands when it freezes. The loosened rock masses plough their way down\r\nthe steep, gathering, as they go, increasing power to tear away any\r\nrocks in their path.\r\n\r\nWind blows finer rock fragments along, and they lodge in cracks. Fine\r\ndust and the seeds of plants are lodged there. The rocky slopes of the\r\nYosemite Valley are all more or less covered with trees and shrubs that\r\nhave come from wind-sown seeds. These plants thrust their roots deeper\r\neach year into the rock crevices. The feeding tips of roots secrete\r\nacids that eat away lime and other substances that occur in rocks. Dead\r\nleaves and other discarded portions of the trees rot about their roots,\r\nand form soil of increasing depth. The largest trees grow on the rocky\r\nsoil deposited at the base of the slope. The tree's roots prevent the\r\nriver from carrying it off.\r\n\r\nWhen granite crumbles, its different mineral elements are separated.\r\nClear, glassy particles of quartz we call sand. Dark particles of\r\nfeldspar become clay, and may harden into slate. Sand may become\r\nsandstone. Exposed slate and sandstone are crumbled by exposure to wind\r\nand frost and moving water, and are deposited again as sand-bars and\r\nbeds of clay.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting phase of soil study is the discovery of what a work\r\nthe humble earthworm does in mellowing and enriching the soil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WORK OF EARTHWORMS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe farmer and the gardener should expect very poor crops if they\r\nplanted seed without first ploughing or spading the soil. Next, its fine\r\nparticles must be separated by the breaking of the hard clods. A wise\r\nman ploughs heavy soil in the fall. It is caked into great clods which\r\ncrumble before planting time. The water in the clods freezes in winter.\r\nThe expansion due to freezing makes this soil water a force that\r\nseparates the fine particles. So the frost works for the farmer.\r\n\r\nJust under the surface of the soil lives a host of workers which are our\r\npatient friends. They work for their living, and are perhaps unconscious\r\nof the fact that they are constantly increasing the fertility of the\r\nsoil. They are the earthworms, also called fishworms, which are\r\ndistributed all over the world. They are not generally known to farmers\r\nand gardeners as friendly, useful creatures, and their services are\r\nrarely noticed. We see robins pulling them out of the ground, and we are\r\nlikely to think the birds are ridding us of a garden pest. What we need\r\nis to use our eyes, and to read the wonderful discoveries recorded in a\r\nbook called \"Vegetable Mould and Earthworms,\" written by Charles\r\nDarwin.\r\n\r\nThe benefits of ploughing and spading are the loosening and pulverizing\r\nof the packed earth; the mixing of dead leaves and other vegetation on\r\nand near the surface with the more solid earth farther down; the letting\r\nin of water and air; and the checking of loss of water through cracks\r\nthe sun forms by baking the soil dry.\r\n\r\nThe earthworm is a creature of the dark. It cannot see, but it is\r\nsufficiently sensitive to light to avoid the sun, the rays of which\r\nwould shrivel up its moist skin. Having no lungs or gills, the worm uses\r\nthe skin as the breathing organ; and it must be kept moist in order to\r\nserve its important use. This is why earthworms are never seen above\r\nground except on rainy days, and never in the top soil if it has become\r\ndry. In seasons of little rain, they go down where the earth is moist,\r\nand venture to the surface only at night, when dew makes their coming up\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nEarthworms have no teeth, but they have a long snout that protrudes\r\nbeyond the mouth. Their food is found on and in the surface soil. They\r\nwill eat scraps of meat by sucking the juices, and scrape off the pulp\r\nof leaves and root vegetables in much the same way. Much of their\r\nsubsistence is upon organic matter that can be extracted from the soil.\r\nQuantities of earth are swallowed. It is rare that an earthworm is dug\r\nup that does not show earth pellets somewhere on their way through the\r\nlong digestive canal. The rich juices of plant substance are absorbed\r\nfrom these pellets as they pass through the body.\r\n\r\nEarthworms explore the surface of the soil by night, and pick up what\r\nthey can find of fresh food. Nowhere have I heard of them as a nuisance\r\nin gardens, but they eagerly feed on bits of meat, especially fat, and\r\non fresh leaves. They drag all such victuals into their burrows, and\r\nbegin the digestion of the food by pouring on it from their mouths a\r\nsecretion somewhat like pancreatic juice.\r\n\r\nThe worms honeycomb the earth with their burrows, which are long,\r\nwinding tubes. In dry or cold weather these burrows may reach eight feet\r\nunder ground. They run obliquely, as a rule, from the surface, and are\r\nlined with a layer of the smooth soil, like soft paste, cast from the\r\nbody. The lining being spread, the burrow fits the worm's body closely.\r\nThis enables it to pass quickly from one end to the other, though it\r\nmust wriggle backward or forward without turning around.\r\n\r\nAt the lower end of the burrow, an enlarged chamber is found, where\r\nhibernating worms coil and sleep together in winter. At the top, a\r\nlining of dead leaves extends downward for a few inches, and in day time\r\na plug of the same material is the outside door. At night the worm comes\r\nto the surface, and casts out the pellets of earth swallowed. The burrow\r\ngrows in length by the amount of earth scraped off by the long snout\r\nand swallowed. The daily amount of excavation done is fairly estimated\r\nby the castings observed each morning on the surface.\r\n\r\nOne earthworm's work for the farmer is not very much, but consider how\r\nmany are at work, and what each one is doing. It is boring holes through\r\nthe solid earth, and letting in the surface water and the air. It is\r\ncarrying the lower soil up to the surface, often the stubborn subsoil,\r\nthat no plough could reach. It is burying and thus hastening the decay\r\nof plant fibre, which lightens heavy soil and makes it rich because it\r\nis porous. Moreover, the earthworms are doing over and over again this\r\nwork of fining and turning over the soil, which the plough does but\r\nseldom.\r\n\r\nBy the continuous carrying up of their castings, the earthworms\r\ngradually bury manures spread on the surface. The collapse of their\r\nburrows and the making of new ones keep the soil constantly in motion.\r\nThe particles are being loosened and brought into contact with the soil\r\nwater, that dissolves, and thus frees for the use of feeding roots, the\r\nplant food stored in the rock particles that compose the mineral part of\r\nthe soil.\r\n\r\nThe weight of earth brought to the surface by worms in the course of a\r\nyear has been carefully estimated. Darwin gives seven to eighteen tons\r\nper acre as the lowest and highest reports, based on careful collecting\r\nof castings by four observers, working on small areas of totally\r\ndifferent soils. In England, earthworms have done a great deal more\r\ntoward burying boulders and ancient ruins than any other agency. They\r\neagerly burrow under heavy objects, the weight of which causes them to\r\ncrush the honeycombed earth. Undiscouraged, the earthworms repeat their\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n\"Long before man existed, the land was regularly ploughed, and continues\r\nstill to be ploughed by earthworms. It may be doubted whether there are\r\nmany other animals which have played so important a part in the history\r\nof the world as have these lowly organized creatures.\"\r\n\r\nAfter years of study, Charles Darwin came to this conclusion. The more\r\nwe study the lives of these earth-consuming creatures, the more fully do\r\nwe believe what the great nature student said. The fertile soil is made\r\nof rock meal and decayed leaves and roots. Only recently have ploughs\r\nbeen invented. But the great forest crops have grown in soil made mellow\r\nby the earthworm's ploughing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQUIET FORCES THAT DESTROY ROCKS\r\n\r\n\r\nWind and water are the blustering active agents we see at work tearing\r\ndown rocks and carrying away their particles. They do the most of this\r\nwork of levelling the land; but there are quiet forces at work which\r\nmight not attract our attention at all, and yet, without their help,\r\nwind and running water would not accomplish half the work for which they\r\ntake the credit.\r\n\r\nThe air contains certain destructive gases which by their chemical\r\naction separate the particles of the hardest rocks, causing them to\r\ncrumble. Now the wind blows away these crumbling particles, and the\r\nsolid unchanged rock beneath is again exposed to the crumbling agencies.\r\n\r\nThe changes in temperature between day and night cause rocks to contract\r\nand expand, and these changes put a strain upon the mineral particles\r\nthat compose them. Much scaling of rock surfaces is due to these causes.\r\nBuilding a fire on top of a rock, and then dashing water upon the heated\r\nmass, shatters it in many directions. This process merely intensifies\r\nthe effect produced by the mild changes of winter and summer. Water is\r\npresent in most rocks, in surprising quantities, often filling the\r\nspaces in porous rocks like sandstones.\r\n\r\nWhen winter brings the temperature down to the freezing point, the water\r\nnear the surface of the rock first feels it. Ice forms, and every\r\nparticle of water is swollen by the change. A strain is put upon the\r\nmineral particles against which the particles of ice crowd for more\r\nroom. Frost is a very powerful agent in the crumbling of rocks, as well\r\nas of stubborn clods of earth. In warm climates, and in desert regions\r\nwhere there is little moisture in the rocks, this destructive action of\r\nfreezing water is not known. In cold countries, and in high altitudes,\r\nwhere the air is heavy with moisture, its greatest work is done.\r\n\r\nSome kinds of rock decay when they become dry, and resist crumbling\r\nbetter when they absorb a certain amount of moisture. Alternate wetting\r\nand drying is destructive to certain rocks.\r\n\r\nOne of the unnoticed agents of rock decay is the action of lowly plants.\r\nMosses grow upon the faces of rocks, thrusting their tiny root processes\r\ninto pits they dig deeper by means of acids secreted by the delicate\r\ntips. You have seen shaded green patches of lichens, like little rugs,\r\nof different shapes, spread on the surface of rocks. But you cannot see\r\nso well the work these growths are doing in etching away the surface,\r\nand feeding upon the decaying mineral substance.\r\n\r\nMosses and lichens do a mighty work, with the help of water, in\r\nreducing rocks to their original elements, and thus forming soil. No\r\nplants but lichens and mosses can grow on the bare faces of rocks. As\r\ntheir root-like processes lengthen and go deeper into the rock face,\r\nparticles are pried off, and the under-substance is attacked. Higher\r\nplants then find a footing. Have you not seen little trees growing on a\r\npatch of moss which gets its food from the air and the rock to which it\r\nclings? The spongy moss cushion soaks up the rain and holds it against\r\nthe rock face. A streak of iron in the rock may cause the water to\r\nfollow and rust it out, leaving a distinct crevice. Now the roots of any\r\nplant that happens to be growing on the moss may find a foot-hold in the\r\ncrack. Streaks of lime in a rock readily absorb water, which gradually\r\ndissolves and absorbs its particles, inviting the roots to enter these\r\nnew passages and feed upon the disintegrating minerals. Dead leaves\r\ndecay, and the acids the trickling water absorbs from them are\r\nespecially active in disintegrating lime rocks.\r\n\r\nFrom such small beginnings has resulted the shattering of great rock\r\nmasses by the growth of plants upon them. Tree roots that grow in rock\r\ncrevices exert a power that is irresistible. The roots of smaller plants\r\ndo the same great work in a quieter way.\r\n\r\nWhen a hurricane or a flood tears down the mountain-side, sweeping\r\neverything before it, trees, torn out by the roots, drag great masses\r\nof rock and soil into the air, and fling them down the slope. Wind and\r\nwater thus finish the destruction which the humble mosses and lichens\r\nbegan. What seemed an impregnable fortress of granite has crumbled into\r\nfragments. Its particles are reduced to dust, or are on the way to this\r\ncondition. The plant food locked up in granite boulders becomes\r\navailable to hungry roots. Forests, grain-fields, and meadows cover the\r\nwork of destructive agencies with a mantle of green.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW ROCKS ARE MADE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe granite shaft is made out of the original substance of the earth's\r\ncrust. Its minerals are the elements out of which all of the rock masses\r\nof the earth are formed, no matter how different they look from granite.\r\nSandstone is made of particles of quartz. Clay and slate are made out of\r\nfeldspar and mica. Iron ore comes from the hornblende in granite. The\r\nmineral particles, reassembled in different proportions, form all of the\r\ndifferent rocks that are known.\r\n\r\nHere in my hand is a piece of pudding-stone. It is made of pebbles of\r\ndifferent sizes, each made of different coloured minerals. The pebbles\r\nare cemented together with a paste that has hardened into stone. This\r\nkind of rock the geologists call _conglomerate_. Pudding-stone is the\r\ncommon name, for the pebbles in the pasty matrix certainly do suggest\r\nthe currants and the raisins that are sprinkled through a Christmas\r\npudding.\r\n\r\nUnder the seashores there are forming to-day thick beds of sand. The\r\nrivers bring the rock material down from the hills, and it is sorted and\r\nlaid down. The moving water drops the heaviest particles near shore, and\r\ncarries the finer ones farther out before letting them fall.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The town of Cripple Creek, Colorado, which has grown up\r\nlike magic since 1891, covers the richest gold and silver mines in the\r\nworld]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The level valley is filled up with fine rock flour washed\r\nfrom the sides of the neighboring mountains]\r\n\r\nThe hard water, that comes through limestone rocks, adds lime in\r\nsolution to the ocean water. All the shellfish of the sea, and the\r\ncreatures with bony skeletons, take in the bone-building, shell-making\r\nlime with their food. Generations of these inhabitants of the sea have\r\ndied, and their shells and bones have accumulated and been transformed\r\ninto thick beds of limestone on the ocean floor. This is going on\r\nto-day; but the limestone does not accumulate as rapidly as when the\r\nocean teemed with shell-bearing creatures of gigantic size. Of these we\r\nshall speak in another chapter.\r\n\r\nThe fine dust that is blown into the ocean from the land, and that makes\r\nriver water muddy, accumulates on the sea bottom as banks of mud, which\r\nby the burden of later deposits is converted into clay. Sandstone is but\r\nthe compressed sand-bank.\r\n\r\nIn the study of mountains, geologists have discovered that old seashores\r\nwere thrown up into the first great ridges that form the backbone of a\r\nmountain system. The Rocky Mountains, and the Appalachian system on the\r\neast, were made out of thick strata of rocks that had been formed by\r\naccumulations of mud and sand--the washings of the land--on the opposite\r\nshores of a great mid-continental sea, that stretched from the crest of\r\none great mountain system across to the other, and north and south from\r\nthe Laurentian Hills to the Gulf of Mexico. The great weight of the\r\naccumulating layers of rock materials on one side, and the wasted land\r\nsurfaces on the other, made the sea border a line of greatest weakness\r\nin the crust of the earth. The shrinking of the globe underneath caused\r\nthe break; mashing and folding followed, throwing the ridge above\r\nsea-level, and making dry land out of rock waste which had been\r\naccumulating, perhaps for millions of years, under the sea. The\r\nwrinkling of the earth's crust was the result of crushing forces which\r\nproduced tremendous heat.\r\n\r\nStreams of lava sprang out through the fissures and poured streams of\r\nmelted rock down the sides of the fold, quite burying, in many places,\r\nthe layers of limestone, sandstone, and clay. Between the strata of\r\nwater-formed rocks there were often created chimney-like openings, into\r\nwhich molten rock from below was forced, forming, when cool, veins and\r\ndikes of rock material, specimens of the substance of the earth's\r\ninterior.\r\n\r\nTremendous pressure and heat, acting upon stratified rocks saturated\r\nwith water transform them into very different kinds of rock. Limestone,\r\nsubjected to these forces, is changed into marble. Clays are transformed\r\ninto slates. Sandstone is changed into quartzite, the sand grains being\r\nmelted so as to become no longer visible to the naked eye. The\r\nanthracite coal of the Pennsylvania mountains is the result of heat and\r\npressure acting upon soft coal. Associated with these beds of hard coal\r\nare beds of black lead, or graphite, the substance used in making \"lead\"\r\npencils. We believe that the same forces that operated to transform clay\r\nrocks into slate, and limestone into marble, transformed soft coal into\r\nhard, and hard coal into graphite, in the days when the earth was young.\r\n\r\nThe word _sedimentary_ is applied to rocks which were originally laid\r\ndown under water, as sediment, brought by running water, or by wind, or\r\nby the decay of organic substances. _Stratified_ rocks are those which\r\nare arranged in layers. Sedimentary rocks will fall into this class.\r\n_Aqueous_ rocks are those which are formed under water. Most of the\r\nstratified and sedimentary rocks, but not all, may be included under\r\nthis term. Rocks that are made out of fragments of other rocks torn down\r\nby the agencies of erosion are called _fragmental_. Wind, water, and ice\r\nare the three great agencies that wear away the land, bring rock\r\nfragments long distances, and deposit them where aqueous rocks are being\r\nformed. Volcanic eruptions bring material from the earth's interior.\r\nThis material ranges all the way from huge boulders to the finest\r\nimpalpable dust, called volcanic ashes. Rivers of ice called glaciers\r\ncrowd against their banks, loosening rock masses and carrying away\r\nfragments of all sizes, in their progress down the valley. Brooks and\r\nrivers carry the pebbles and the larger rock masses they are able to\r\nloosen from their walls and beds, and grind them smooth as they move\r\nalong toward lower levels.\r\n\r\nThe air itself causes rocks to crumble; percolating water robs them of\r\ntheir soluble salts, reducing even solid granite to a loose mass of\r\nquartz grains and clay. Plants and animals absorb as food the mineral\r\nsubstances of rocks, when they are dissolved in water. They transform\r\nthese food elements into their own body substance, and finally give back\r\ntheir dead bodies, the mineral substances of which are freed by decay to\r\nreturn to the earth, and become elements of rock again.\r\n\r\nThe decay of rock is well shown by the materials that accumulate at the\r\nbase of a cliff. Angular fragments of all sizes, but all more or less\r\nflattened, come from strata of shaly rock, that can be seen jutting out\r\nfar above. A great deal of this sort of material is found mingled with\r\nthe soil of the Northeastern States. Round pebbles in pudding-stone have\r\nbeen formed in brook beds and deposited on beaches where they have\r\nbecome caked in mud and finally consolidated into rock. If the beach\r\nchanced to be sandy instead of muddy, a matrix of sandy paste holds the\r\nlarger pebbles in place. Limestone paste cements together the pebbles of\r\nlimestone conglomerates.\r\n\r\nIn St. Augustine many of the houses are built of coquina rock, a mass of\r\nbroken shells which have become cemented together by lime mud, derived\r\nfrom their own decay. On the slopes of volcanoes, rock fragments of all\r\nkinds are cemented together by the flowing lava. So we see that there\r\nare pudding-stones of many kinds to be found. If some solvent acid is\r\npresent in the water that percolates through these rocks it may soften\r\nthe cement and thus free the pebbles, reducing the conglomerate again to\r\na mere heap of shell fragments, or gravel, or rounded pebbles.\r\n\r\nThe story of rock formation tells how fire and water, and the two\r\ncombined, have made, and made over, again and again, the substance of\r\nthe earth's crust. Chemical and physical changes constantly tear down\r\nsome portions of the earth to build up others. The constant, combined\r\neffort of wind and water is to level the earth and fill up the ocean\r\nbed. Rocks are constantly being formed; the changes that have been going\r\non since the world began are still in progress. We can see them all\r\nabout us on any and every day of our lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGETTING ACQUAINTED WITH A RIVER\r\n\r\n\r\nI have two friends whose childhood was spent in a home on the banks of a\r\nnoble eastern river. Their father taught the boy and the girl to row a\r\nboat, and later each learned the more difficult art of managing a canoe.\r\nOn holidays they enjoyed no pleasure so much as a picnic on the\r\nriver-bank at some point that could be reached by rowing. As they grew\r\nolder, longer trips were planned, and the river was explored as far as\r\nit was navigable by boat or canoe. Last summer when vacation came, these\r\ntwo carried out a long-cherished plan to find the beginning of the\r\nriver--to follow it to its source. So they left home, and canoed\r\nup-stream, until the stream became a brook, so shallow they could go no\r\nfarther. Then they followed it on foot--wading, climbing, making little\r\ndétours, but never losing the little river. At last they came to the\r\nbeginning of it--a tiny rivulet trickled out of the side of a hill,\r\nfilling a wooden keg that formed a basin, where thirsty passers-by could\r\nstoop and drink. They decided to mark the spring, so that people who\r\nfound it later, and were refreshed by its clear water, might know that\r\nhere was born the greatest river of a great state. But they were not the\r\noriginal discoverers. Above the spring, a board was nailed to a tree,\r\nsaying that this is the headwater of the river with the beautiful Indian\r\nname, Susquehanna.\r\n\r\nIt was a dry summer, and the overflow of the basin was almost all drunk\r\nup by the thirsty ground. They could scarcely follow it, except by the\r\ngroove cut by the rivulet in seasons when the flow was greater. They\r\nfollowed the runaway brook, through the grass roots, that almost hid it.\r\nAs the ground grew steeper, it hurried faster. Soon it gathered the\r\nwater of other springs, which hurried toward it in small rivulets,\r\nbecause its level was lower. Water always seeks the lowest level it can\r\nfind. Sometimes marshy spots were reached where water stood in the holes\r\nmade by the feet of cattle that came there to drink. The water was\r\nmuddy, and seemed to stand still. But it was settling steadily, and at\r\none side the little river was found, flowing away with the water it drew\r\nfrom the swampy, springy ground. All the mud was gone, now; the water\r\nwas clear. It flowed in a bed with a stony floor, and there were rough\r\nsteps where the water fell down in little sheets, forming a waterfall,\r\nthe first of many that make this river beautiful in the upper half of\r\nits course. To get from the high level of that hillside spring to the\r\nlow level of the sea, the water has to make a fall of twenty-three\r\nhundred feet, but it makes the descent gradually. It could not climb\r\nover anything, but always found a way to get around the rocks and hills\r\nthat stood in its way. When the flat marsh land interfered, the water\r\npoured in and overflowed the basin at the lowest margin.\r\n\r\nIn the rocky ground the two explorers found that the stream had widened\r\nits channel by entering a narrow crevice and wearing away its walls. The\r\ncontinual washing of the water wears away stone. Rocks are softened by\r\nbeing wet. Streaks of iron in the hardest granite will rust out and let\r\nthe water in. Then the lime in rocks is easily dissolved. Every dead\r\nleaf the river carried along added an acid to the water, and this made\r\neasier the process of dissolving the limestone.\r\n\r\nEvery crumbling rock gives the river tools that it uses like hammer and\r\nchisel and sandpaper to smooth all the uneven surfaces in its bed, to\r\nmove stumbling blocks, and to dig the bed deeper and wider. The steeper\r\nthe slope is, the faster the stream flows, and the larger the rocks it\r\ncan carry. Rocks loosened from the stream bed are rolled along by the\r\ncurrent. Then bang! against the rocks that are not loose, and often they\r\nare able to break them loose. The fine sand is swept along, and its\r\nsharp points strike like steel needles, and do a great work in polishing\r\nroughness and loosening small particles from the stream bed. The bigger\r\npebbles of the stream have banged against the rock walls, with the same\r\neffect, smoothing away unevenness and pounding fragments loose, rolling\r\nagainst one another, and getting their own rough corners worn away.\r\n\r\nThe makers of stone marbles learned their business from a brook. They\r\ncut the stone into cubical blocks, and throw them into troughs, into\r\nwhich is poured a stream of running water. The blocks are kept in\r\nmotion, and the grinding makes each block help the rest to grind off the\r\neight corners and the twelve ridges of each one. The water becomes muddy\r\nwith the fine particles, just as the drip from a grindstone becomes\r\nunclean when an axe is ground. Pretty soon all the blocks in the trough\r\nare changed into globes--the marbles that children buy at the shops when\r\nmarble season comes around.\r\n\r\nI suppose if the troughs are not watched and emptied in time, the\r\nmarbles would gradually be ground down to the size of peas, then to the\r\nsize of small bird shot, and finally they would escape as muddy water\r\nand fine sand grains.\r\n\r\nSure it is that the sandy shores that line most rivers are the remnants\r\nof hard rocks that have been torn out and ground up by the action of the\r\ncurrent.\r\n\r\nNot very many miles from its first waterfall the stream had grown so\r\nlarge that my two friends knew that they would soon find their canoes.\r\nThe plan now was to float down the curious, winding river and to learn,\r\nif the river and the banks could tell them, just why the course was so\r\ncrooked on the map. They came into a broad, level valley where streams\r\nmet them, coming out of deep clefts between the hills they were leaving\r\nbehind them. The banks were pebbly, but blackened with slimy mud that\r\nmade the water murky. The current swerved from one side to the other,\r\nsometimes quite close to the bank, where the river turned and formed a\r\ndeep bend. On this side the bank was steep, the roots of plants and\r\ntrees exposed. On the opposite side a muddy bank sloped gently out into\r\nthe stream. Here building up was going on, to offset the tearing down.\r\n\r\nThe sharp bends are made sharper, once the current is deflected from the\r\nmiddle of the stream to one side. At length the loops bend on each other\r\nand come so near together that the current breaks through, leaving a\r\nsemicircular bayou of still water, and the river's course straightened\r\nat that place. It must have been in a spring flood that this cut-off was\r\nmade, and, the break once made was easily widened, for the soil is fine\r\nmud which, when soaked, crumbles and dissolves into muddy water.\r\n\r\nStately and slow that river moves down to the bay, into which it empties\r\nits load. The rain that falls on hundreds of square miles of territory\r\nflows into the streams that feed this trunk. The little spring that is\r\nthe headwater of the system is but one of many pockets in the hillsides\r\nthat hold the water that soaks into the ground and give it out by slow\r\ndegrees. Surface water after a rain flows quickly into the streams. It\r\nis the springs that hold back their supply and keep the rivers from\r\nrunning dry in hot weather.\r\n\r\nDo they feel now that they know their river? Are they ready to leave it,\r\nand explore some other? Indeed, no. They are barely introduced to it.\r\nAll kinds of rivers are shown by the different parts of this one. It is\r\na river of the mountains and of the lowland. It flows through woods and\r\nprairies, through rocky passes and reedy flats. It races impetuously in\r\nits youth, and plods sedately in later life. The trees and the other\r\nplants that shadow this stream, and live by its bounty, are very\r\ndifferent in the upland and in the lowland. The scenery along this\r\nstream shows endless variety. Up yonder all is wild. Down here great\r\nbridges span the flood, boats of all kinds carry on the commerce between\r\ntwo neighbour cities. A great park comes down to the river-bank on one\r\nside. Canoes are thick as they can paddle on late summer afternoons.\r\n\r\nNo one can ever really know a river well enough to feel that it is an\r\nold story. There is always something new it has to tell its friends. So\r\nmy two explorers say, and they know far more about their friendly river\r\nthan I do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WAYS OF RIVERS\r\n\r\n\r\nA canal is an artificial river, built to carry boats from one place to\r\nanother. Its course is, as nearly as possible, a straight line between\r\ntwo points. A river, we all agree, is more beautiful than a canal, for\r\nit winds in graceful curves, in and out among the hills, its waters\r\nseeking the lowest level, always.\r\n\r\nNo artist could lay out curves more beautiful than the river forms.\r\nThese curves change from year to year, some slowly, some more rapidly.\r\nIt is not hard to understand just why these changes take place.\r\n\r\nSome rivers are dangerous for boating at certain points. The current is\r\nstrong, and there are eddies and whirlpools that have to be avoided, or\r\nthe boat becomes unmanageable. People are drowned each season by\r\ntrusting themselves to rivers the dangerous tricks of which they do not\r\nknow. Deep holes are washed out of the bed of the stream by whirling\r\neddies. The pot-holes of which people talk are deep, rounded cavities,\r\nground out of the rocky stream-bed by the scouring of sand and loose\r\nstones driven by whirling eddies in shallow basins. Every year deepens\r\neach pot-hole until some change in the stream-bed shifts the eddy to\r\nanother place.\r\n\r\nNo stream finds its channel ready-made; it makes its own, and constantly\r\nchanges it. The current swings to one side of the channel, lifting the\r\nloose sediment and grinding deeper the bed of the stream. The water lags\r\non the opposite side, and sediment falls to the bottom. So the\r\nbuilding-up of one side is going on at the same time that the\r\ntearing-down process is being carried on on the other. With the lowering\r\nof the bed the river swerves toward one bank, and a hollow is worn by\r\nslow degrees. The current swings into this hollow, and in passing out is\r\nthrown across the stream to the opposite bank. Here its force wears away\r\nanother hollow; and so it zigzags down-stream. The deeper the hollows,\r\nthe more curved becomes the course, if the general fall is but moderate.\r\nIt is toward the lower courses of the stream that the winding becomes\r\nmore noticeable. The sediment that is carried is deposited at the point\r\nwhere the current is least strong, so that while the outcurves become\r\nsharper by the tearing away of the stream's bank, the incurves become\r\nsharper by the building up of this bank.\r\n\r\nThe Mississippi below Memphis is thrown into a wonderful series of\r\ncurves by the erosion and the deposit caused by the current zigzagging\r\nback and forth from one bank to the other. Gradually the curves become\r\nloops. The river's current finally jumps across the meeting of the\r\ncurves, and abandons the circular bend. It becomes a bayou or lagoon of\r\nstill water, while the current flows on in the straightened channel.\r\nAll rivers that flow through flat, swampy land show these intricate\r\nwinding channels and many lagoons that have once been curves of the\r\nriver.\r\n\r\nNo one would ever mistake a river for a lake or any other body of water,\r\nyet rivers differ greatly in character. One tears its way along down its\r\nsteep, rock-encumbered channel between walls that rise as vertical\r\nprecipices on both sides. The roaming, angry waters are drawn into\r\nwhirlpools in one place. They lie stagnant as if sulking in another,\r\nthen leap boisterously over ledges of rock and are churned into creamy\r\nfoam at the bottom. Outside the mountainous part of its course this same\r\nriver flows broad and calm through a mud-banked channel, cut by\r\ntributary streams that draw in the water of low, sloping hills.\r\n\r\nThe Missouri is such a wild mountain stream at its headwaters. We who\r\nhave seen its muddy waters from Sioux City to St. Louis would hardly\r\nbelieve that its impetuous and picturesque youth could merge into an old\r\nage so comfortable and placid and commonplace.\r\n\r\nThis thing is true of all rivers. They flow, gradually or suddenly, from\r\nhigher to lower levels. To reach the lowest level as soon as possible is\r\nthe end each river is striving toward. If it could, each river would cut\r\nits bed to this depth at the first stage of its course. Its tools are\r\nthe rocks it carries, great and small. The force that uses these tools\r\nis the power of falling water, represented by the current of the stream.\r\nThe upper part of a river such as the Missouri or Mississippi engages in\r\na campaign of widening and deepening its channel, and carrying away\r\nquantities of sediment. The lower reaches of the stream flow through\r\nmore level country; the current is checked, and a vast burden of\r\nsediment is laid down. Instead of tearing away its banks and bottom, the\r\nriver fills up gradually with mud. The current meanders between banks of\r\nsediment over a bottom which becomes shallower year by year. The Rocky\r\nMountains are being carried to the Gulf of Mexico. The commerce of the\r\nriver is impeded by mountain débris deposited as mud-banks along the\r\nriver's lower course.\r\n\r\nMany rivers are quiet and commonplace throughout their length. They flow\r\nbetween low, rounded hills, and are joined by quiet streams, that occupy\r\nthe separating grooves between the hills. This is the oldest type of\r\nriver. It has done its work. Rainfall and stream-flow have brought the\r\nlevel of the land nearly to the level of the stream. Very little more is\r\nleft to be ground down and carried away. The landscape is beautiful, but\r\nit is no longer picturesque. Wind and water have smoothed away\r\nunevennesses. Trees and grass and other vegetation check erosion, and\r\nthe river has little to do but to carry away the surface water that\r\nfalls as rain.\r\n\r\nBut suppose our river, flowing gently between its grassy banks, should\r\nfeel some mighty power lifting it up, with all its neighbour hills and\r\nvalleys, to form a wrinkle in the still unstable crust of the earth.\r\nAway off at the river's mouth the level may not have changed, or that\r\nregion may have been depressed instead of elevated by the shrinking\r\nprocess. Suppose the great upheaval has not severed the upper from the\r\nlower courses of the stream. With tremendous force and speed, the\r\ncurrent flows from the higher levels to the lower. The river in the\r\nhighlands strikes hard to reach the level of its mouth. It grinds with\r\nall its might, and all its rocky tools, upon its bed. All the mud is\r\nscoured out, and then the underlying rocks are attacked. If these rocks\r\nare soft and easily worn away, the channel deepens rapidly. One after\r\nanother the alternating layers are excavated, and the river flows in a\r\ncanyon which deepens more and more. As the level is lowered, the current\r\nof the stream becomes slower and the cutting away of its bed less rapid.\r\nThe stream is content to flow gently, for it has almost reached the old\r\nlevel, on which it flowed before the valley became a ridge or\r\ntable-land.\r\n\r\nThe rivers that flow in canyons have been thousands of years in carving\r\nout their channels, yet they are newer, geologically speaking, than the\r\nstreams that drain the level prairie country. The earth has risen, and\r\nthe canyons have been carved since the prairies became rolling, level\r\nground.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: This little pond is a basin hollowed by the same glacier\r\nthat scattered the stones and rounded the hills]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Every stream is wearing away its banks, while trees and\r\ngrass blades are holding on to the soil with all their roots]\r\n\r\nThe Colorado River flows through a canyon with walls that in places\r\npresent sheer vertical faces a mile in depth, and so smooth that no\r\ntrail can be found by which to reach from top to bottom. The region has\r\nbut slight erosion by wind, and practically none by rain. The local\r\nrainfall is very slight. So the river is the one force that has acted to\r\ncut down the rocks, and its force is all expended in the narrow area of\r\nits own bed. Had frequent rains been the rule on the Colorado plateau,\r\nthe angles of the mesas would have been rounded into hills of the\r\nfamiliar kind so constantly a part of the landscape in the eastern half\r\nof the continent.\r\n\r\nThe Colorado is an ancient river which has to carry away the store of\r\nmoisture that comes from the Pacific Ocean and falls as snow on the high\r\npeaks of the Rocky Mountains. Similar river gorges with similar stories\r\nto tell are the Arkansas, the Platte, and the Yellowstone. All cut their\r\nchannels unaided through regions of little rain.\r\n\r\nWhen the earth's crust is thrown up in mountain folds, and between them\r\nvalleys are formed, the level of rivers is sometimes lowered and the\r\nrapidity of their flow is checked. A stream which has torn down its\r\nwalls at a rapid rate becomes a sluggish water-course, its current\r\nclogged with sediment, which it has no power to carry farther. When such\r\na river begins to build and obstruct its own waters it bars its progress\r\nand may form a lake as the outlet of its tributary streams. Many ancient\r\nrivers have been utterly changed and some obliterated by general\r\nmovements of the earth's crust.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STORY OF A POND\r\n\r\n\r\nLook out of the car window as you cross a flat stretch of new prairie\r\ncountry, and you see a great many little ponds of water dotting the\r\ngreen landscape. Forty years ago Iowa was a good place to see ponds of\r\nall shapes and sizes. The copious rainfall of the early spring gathered\r\nin the hollows of the land, and the stiff clay subsoil prevented the\r\nwater from soaking quickly into the ground. The ponds might dry away\r\nduring the hot, dry summer, leaving a baked clay basin, checked with an\r\nintricate system of cracks. Or if rains were frequent and heavy, they\r\nmight keep full to the brim throughout the season.\r\n\r\nTall bulrushes stood around the margins of the largest ponds, and\r\nwater-lilies blossomed on the surface during the summer. The bass and\r\nthe treble of the spring chorus were made by frogs and toads and little\r\nhylas, all of which resorted to the ponds to lay their eggs, in coiled\r\nropes or spongy masses, according to their various family traditions. On\r\nmany a spring night my zoölogy class and I have visited the squashy\r\nmargins of these ponds, and, by the light of a lantern, seen singing\r\ntoads and frogs sitting on bare hummocks of grass roots that stood\r\nabove the water-line. The throat of each musician was puffed out into a\r\nbag about the size and shape of a small hen's egg; and all were singing\r\nfor dear life, and making a din that was almost ear-splitting at close\r\nrange. So great was the self-absorption of these singers that we could\r\napproach them, daze them with the light of the lantern, and capture any\r\nnumber of them with our long-handled nets before they noticed us. But it\r\nwas not easy to persuade them to sing in captivity, no matter how many\r\nof the comforts of home we provided in the school aquariums. So, after\r\nsome very interesting nature studies, we always carried them back and\r\nliberated them, where they could rejoin their kinsfolk and neighbours.\r\n\r\nIt was when we were scraping the mud from our rubber boots that we\r\nrealized the character of the bottoms of our prairie ponds. The slimy\r\nblack deposit was made partly of the clay bottom, but largely of\r\ndecaying roots and tops of water plants of various kinds. Whenever it\r\nrained or the wind blew hard, the bottom was stirred enough to make the\r\nwater muddy; and on the quietest days a pail of pond water had a tinge\r\nof brown because there were always decaying leaves and other rubbish to\r\nstain its purity.\r\n\r\nThe farmers drained the ponds as fast as they were able, carrying the\r\nwater, by open ditches first, and later by underground tile drains, to\r\nlower levels. Finally these trunk drain pipes discharged the water into\r\nstreams or lakes. To-day a large proportion of the pond areas of Iowa\r\nhas disappeared; the hollow tile of terra-cotta has been the most\r\nefficient means of converting the waste land, covered by ponds, into\r\nfertile fields.\r\n\r\nBut the ponds that have not been drained are smaller than they used to\r\nbe, and are on the straight road to extinction. This process one can see\r\nat any time by visiting a pond. Every year a crop of reeds and a dozen\r\nother species of vigorous water plants dies at the top and adds the\r\nsubstance of their summer growth to the dust and other refuse that\r\ngathers in the bottom of the pond. Each spring roots and seeds send up\r\nanother crop, if possible more vigorous than the last, and this top\r\ngrowth in turn dies and lies upon the bottom. The pond level varies with\r\nthe rainfall of the years, but it averages a certain depth, from which\r\nsomething is each year subtracted by the accumulations of rotting\r\nvegetable matter in the bottom. Evaporation lowers the water-level,\r\nespecially in hot, dry summers. From year to year the water plants draw\r\nin to form a smaller circle, the grassy meadow land encroaches on all\r\nsides. The end of the story is the filling up of the pond basin with the\r\nrotting substance of its own vegetation. This is what is happening to\r\nponds and inland marshes by slow degrees. The tile drain pipes\r\nobliterate the pond in a single season. Nature is more deliberate. She\r\nmay require a hundred years to fill up a single pond which the farmer\r\ncan rid himself of by a few days of work and a few rods of tiling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RIDDLE OF THE LOST ROCKS\r\n\r\n\r\nOutside of my window two robins are building a nest in the crotch of a\r\nblossoming red maple tree. And just across the hedge, men are digging a\r\nbig square hole in the ground--the cellar of our neighbour's new house.\r\nIt looks now as if the robins would get their house built first, for\r\nthey need but one room, and they do not trouble about a cellar. I shall\r\nwatch both houses as they grow through the breezy March days.\r\n\r\nThe brown sod was first torn up by a plough, which uncovered the red New\r\nJersey soil. Two men, with a team hitched to a scraper, have carried\r\nload after load of the loose earth to a heap on the back of the lot,\r\nwhile two other men with pickaxes dug into the hard subsoil, loosening\r\nit, so that the scraper could scoop it up.\r\n\r\nThis subsoil is heavy, like clay, and it breaks apart into hard clods.\r\nAt the surface the men found a network of tree roots, about which the\r\nsoil easily crumbled. Often I hear a sharp, metallic stroke, unlike the\r\ndull sound of the picks striking into the earth. The digger has struck a\r\nstone, and he must work around it, pry it up and lift it out of the way.\r\nA row of these stones is seen at one side of the cellar hole, ranged\r\nalong the bank. They are all different in size and shape, and red with\r\nclay, so I can't tell what they are made of. But from this distance I\r\nsee plainly that they are irregular in form and have no sharp corners.\r\nThe soil strewn along the lot by the scraper is full of stones, mostly\r\nirregular, but some rounded; some are as big as your head, others grade\r\ndown to the sizes of marbles.\r\n\r\nWhen I went down and examined this red earth, I found pebbles of all\r\nshapes and sizes, gravel in with the clay, and grains of sand. This\r\nrock-sprinkled soil in New Jersey is very much like soil which I know\r\nvery well in Iowa; it looks different in colour, but those pebbles and\r\nrock fragments must be explained in the same way here as there.\r\n\r\nThese are not native stones, the outcrop of near-by hillsides, but\r\nstrangers in this region. The stones in Iowa soil are also imported.\r\n\r\nThe prairie land of Iowa has not many big rocks on the surface, yet\r\nenough of them to make trouble. The man who was ploughing kept a sharp\r\nlookout, and swung his plough point away from a buried rock that showed\r\nabove ground, lest it should break the steel blade. One of the farmer's\r\njobs for the less busy season was to go out with sledge and dynamite\r\nsticks, and blast into fragments the buried boulders too large to move.\r\nSometimes building a hot fire on the top of it, and throwing on water,\r\nwould crack the stubborn \"dornick\" into pieces small enough to be loaded\r\non stone-boats.\r\n\r\nI remember when the last giant boulder whose buried bulk scarcely showed\r\nat the surface, was fractured by dynamite. Its total weight proved to be\r\nmany tons. We hauled the pieces to the great stone pile which furnished\r\nmaterials for walling the sides of a deep well and for laying the\r\nfoundation of the new house. Yet for years stones have been\r\naccumulating, all of them turned out of the same farm, when pastures and\r\nswampy land came under the plough.\r\n\r\nDraw a line on the map from New York to St. Louis, and then turn\r\nnorthward a little and extend it to the Yellowstone Park. The\r\nboulder-strewn states lie north of this line, and are not found south of\r\nit, anywhere. Canada has boulders just like those of our Northern\r\nStates. The same power scattered them over all of the vast northern half\r\nof North America and a large part of Europe.\r\n\r\nWhat explanation is there for this extensive distribution of unsorted\r\ndébris?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE QUESTION ANSWERED\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rocks tell their own story, partly, but not wholly. They told just\r\nenough to keep the early geologists guessing; and only very recently has\r\nthe guessing come upon the truth.\r\n\r\nThese things the rocks told:\r\n\r\n1. We have come from a distance.\r\n\r\n2. We have had our sharp corners worn off.\r\n\r\n3. Many of us have deep scratches on our sides.\r\n\r\n4. At various places we have been dumped in long ridges, mixed with much\r\nearth.\r\n\r\n5. A big boulder is often balanced on another one.\r\n\r\nThe first thing the geologist noted was the fact that these boulders are\r\nstrangers--that is, they are not the native rocks that outcrop on\r\nhillsides and on mountain slopes near where they are found. Far to the\r\nnorth are beds of rock from which this débris undoubtedly came. Could a\r\nflood have scattered them as they are found? No, for water sorts the\r\nrock débris it deposits, and it rounds and polishes rock fragments,\r\ninstead of scratching and grooving them and leaving them angular, as\r\nthese are.\r\n\r\nProfessor Agassiz went to Switzerland and studied the glaciers. He found\r\nunsorted rock fragments where the glacier's nose melted, and let them\r\nfall. They were worn and scratched and grooved, by being frozen into the\r\nice, and dragged over the rocky bed of the stream. The rocky walls of\r\nthe valley were scored by the glacier's tools. Rounded domes of rock\r\njutted out of the ground, in the paths of the ice streams, just like the\r\ngranite outcrop in Central Park in New York, and many others in the\r\nregion of scattered boulders.\r\n\r\nAfter long studies in Europe and in North America, Professor Agassiz\r\ndeclared his belief that a great ice-sheet once covered the northern\r\nhalf of both countries, rounding the hills, scooping out the valleys and\r\nlake basins, and scattering the boulders, gravel, and clay, as it\r\ngradually melted away.\r\n\r\nThe belief of Professor Agassiz was not accepted at once, but further\r\nstudies prove that he guessed the riddle of the boulders. The rich soil\r\nof the Northern States is the glacial drift--the mixture of rock\r\nfragments of all sizes with fine boulder clay, left by the gradual\r\nmelting of the great ice-sheet as it retreated northward at the end of\r\nthe \"Glacial Epoch.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGLACIERS AMONG THE ALPS\r\n\r\n\r\nSwitzerland is a little country without any seacoast, mountainous, with\r\nsteep, lofty peaks, and narrow valleys. The climate is cool and moist,\r\nand snow falls the year round on the mountain slopes. A snow-cap covers\r\nthe lower peaks and ridges. Above the level of nine thousand feet the\r\nbare peaks rise into a dry atmosphere; but below this altitude, and\r\nabove the six thousand-foot mark, lies the belt of greatest snowfall.\r\nPeaks between six and nine thousand feet high are buried under the\r\nAlpine snow-field, which adds thickness with each storm, and is drained\r\naway to feed the rushing mountain streams in the lower valleys.\r\n\r\nThe snow that falls on the steep, smooth slope clings at first; but as\r\nthe thickness and the weight of these snow banks increase, their hold on\r\nthe slope weakens. They may slip off, at any moment. The village at the\r\nfoot of the slope is in danger of being buried under a snow-slide, which\r\npeople call an avalanche. \"Challanche\" is another name for it. The\r\nhunter on the snow-clad mountains dares not shout for fear that his\r\nvoice, reëchoing among the silent mountains, may start an avalanche on\r\nits deadly plunge into the valley.\r\n\r\nOn the surface of the snow-field, light snow-flakes rest. Under them the\r\nsnow is packed closer. Deeper down, the snow is granular, like pellets\r\nof ice; and still under this is ice, made of snow under pressure. The\r\nweight of the accumulated snow presses the underlying ice out into the\r\nvalleys. These streams are the glaciers--rivers of ice.\r\n\r\nThe glaciers of the Alps vary in length from five to fifteen miles, from\r\none to three miles in width, and from two hundred to six hundred feet in\r\nthickness. They flow at the rate of from one to three feet a day, going\r\nfaster on the steeper slopes.\r\n\r\nIt is hard to believe that any substance as solid and brittle as ice can\r\nflow. Its movement is like that of stiff molasses, or wax, or pitch. The\r\ntremendous pressure of the snow-field pushes the mass of ice out into\r\nthe valleys, and its own weight, combined with the constant pressure\r\nfrom behind, keeps it moving.\r\n\r\nThe glacier's progress is hindered by the uneven walls and bed of the\r\nvalley, and by any decrease in the slope of the bed. When a flat, broad\r\narea is reached, a lake of ice may be formed. These are not frequent in\r\nthe Alps. The water near the banks and at the bottom of a river does not\r\nflow as swiftly as in the middle and at the surface of the stream. The\r\nflow of ice in a glacier is just so. Friction with the banks and bottom\r\nretards the ice while the middle parts go forward, melting under the\r\nstrain, and freezing again. There is a constant readjusting of\r\nparticles, which does not affect the solidity of the mass.\r\n\r\nThe ice moulds itself over any unevenness in its bed if it cannot remove\r\nthe obstruction. The drop which would cause a small waterfall in a\r\nriver, makes a bend in the thick body of the ice river. Great cracks,\r\ncalled _crevasses_, are made at the surface, along the line of the bend.\r\nThe width of the V-shaped openings depends upon the depth of the glacier\r\nand the sharpness of the bend that causes the breaks.\r\n\r\nRocky ridges in the bed of the ice-stream may cause crevasses that run\r\nlengthwise of the glacier. Snow may fill these chasms or bridge them\r\nover. The hunter or the tourist who ventures on the glacier is in\r\nconstant danger, unless he sees solid ice under him. Men rope themselves\r\ntogether in climbing over perilous places, so that if one slips into a\r\ncrevasse his mates can save him.\r\n\r\nA glacier tears away and carries away quantities of rock and earth that\r\nform the walls of its bed. As the valley narrows, tremendous pressure\r\ncrowds the ice against the sides, tearing trees out by the roots and\r\ncausing rock masses to fall on the top of the glacier, or to be dragged\r\nalong frozen solidly into its sides. The weight of the ice bears on the\r\nbed of the glacier, and its progress crowds irresistibly against all\r\nloose rock material. The glacier's tools are the rocks it carries frozen\r\ninto its icy walls and bottom. These rocks rub against the walls,\r\ngrinding off débris which is pushed or carried along. No matter how\r\nheavy the boulders are that fall in the way of the ice river, the ice\r\ncarries them along. It cannot drop them as a river of water would do.\r\nSlowly they travel, and finally stop where the nose of the glacier melts\r\nand leaves all débris that the mountain stream, fed by the melting of\r\nthe ice, cannot carry away.\r\n\r\nThe bedrock under a glacier is scraped and ground and scored by the\r\nglacier's tools--the rock fragments frozen into the bottom of the ice.\r\nThese rocks are worn away by constant grinding, just as a steel knife\r\nbecomes thin and narrow by use. Scratches and scorings and polished\r\nsurfaces are found in all rocks that pass one another in close contact.\r\nIts worn-out tools the glacier drops at the point where its ice melts.\r\nThis great, unsorted mass of rock meal and coarser débris the stream is\r\ngradually scattering down the valley.\r\n\r\nThe name \"moraine\" has been given to the earth rubbish a glacier\r\ncollects and finally dumps. The _top moraine_ is at the surface of the\r\nice. The _lateral moraines_, one at each side, are the débris gathered\r\nfrom the sides of the valley. The _ground moraine_ is what débris the\r\nice pushes and drags along on the bottom. The _terminal moraine_ is the\r\ndumping-ground of this mass of material, where the ice river melts.\r\n\r\nGlaciers, like other rivers, often have tributary streams. A _median\r\nmoraine_, seen as a dark streak running lengthwise on the surface of a\r\nglacier, means that two branch glaciers have united to form this one. Go\r\nback far enough and you will reach the place where the two streams come\r\ntogether. The two lateral moraines that join form the middle line of\r\ndébris, the median moraine. Three ice-streams joined produce two top\r\nmoraines. They locate the lateral moraines of the middle glacier.\r\n\r\nThe surface of a glacier is often a mass of broken and rough ice,\r\nforming a series of pits and pinnacles that make crossing impossible.\r\nThe sun melts the surface, forming pools and percolating streams of\r\nwater, that honeycomb the mass. Underneath, the ice is tunnelled, and a\r\nrushing stream flows out under the end of the glacier. It is not clear,\r\nbut black with mud, called _boulder clay_, or _till_, made of ground\r\nrock, and mixed with fragments of all shapes and sizes. This is the meal\r\nfrom the glacier's mill, dumped where the water can sift it.\r\n\r\n\"Balanced rocks\" are boulders, one upon another, that once lay on a\r\nglacier, and were left in this strange, unstable position when the\r\nsupporting ice walls melted away from them. In Bronx Park in New York\r\nthe \"rocking stone\" always attracts attention. The glacier that lodged\r\nit there, also rounded the granite dome in Central Park and scattered\r\nthe rock-strewn boulder clay on Long Island. Doubtless in an earlier day\r\nthe edges of this glacier were thrust out into the Atlantic, not far\r\nfrom the Great South Bay, and icebergs broke off and floated away.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Potsdam sandstone showing ripple marks]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _By permission of the American Museum of Natural History_\r\n\r\nGlacial striæ on Lower Helderberg limestone]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Glacial grooves in the South Meadow, Central Park, New\r\nYork]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _By permission of the American Museum of Natural History_\r\n\r\nMt. Tom, West 83d St., New York]\r\n\r\nGlaciers are small to-day compared with what they were long ago, in\r\nEurope and in America. The climate became warmer, and the ice-cap\r\nretreated. Old moraines show that the ice rivers of the Alps once came\r\nmuch farther down the valleys than they do now. Smooth, deeply scored\r\ndomes of rock, the one in Central Park and the bald head of Mount Tom,\r\nare just like those that lie in Alpine valleys from which the glaciers\r\nhave long ago retreated. There are old moraines far up the sides of\r\nvalleys, showing that once the glaciers were far deeper than now. No\r\nother power could have brought rocks from strata higher up the\r\nmountains, and lodged them thus.\r\n\r\nNearer home, Mt. Shasta and Mt. Rainier still have glaciers that have\r\ndwindled in size, until they bear little comparison to the gigantic\r\nice-streams that once filled the smooth beds their puny successors flow\r\ninto. Remnants of glaciers lie in the hollows of the Sierras. We must go\r\nnorth to find the snow-fields of Alaska and glaciers worthy to be\r\ncompared with those ancient ice rivers whose work is plainly to be seen,\r\nthough they are gone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT ICE-SHEET\r\n\r\n\r\nGreenland is green only along its southern edge, and only in summer, so\r\nits name is misleading. It is a frozen continent lying under a great\r\nice-cap, which covers 500,000 square miles and is several thousand feet\r\nin thickness. The top of this icy table-land rises from five thousand to\r\nten thousand feet above the sea-level. The long, cold winters are marked\r\nby great snowfall, and the drifts do not have time to melt during the\r\nshort summer; and so they keep getting deeper and deeper. Streams of ice\r\nflow down the steeps into the sea, and break off by their weight when\r\nthey are pushed out into the water. These are the icebergs which float\r\noff into the North Atlantic, and are often seen by passengers on\r\ntransatlantic steamers.\r\n\r\nLong ago Greenland better deserved its name. Explorers who have climbed\r\nthe mountain steeps that guard the unknown ice-fields of the interior\r\nhave discovered, a thousand feet above the sea-level, an ancient beach,\r\nstrewn with shells of molluscs like those which now inhabit salt water,\r\nand skeletons of fishes lie buried in the sand. It is impossible to\r\nthink that the ocean has subsided. The only explanation that accounts\r\nfor the ancient beach, high and dry on the side of Greenland's icy\r\nmountain is that the continent has been lifted a thousand feet above its\r\nformer level. This is an accepted fact.\r\n\r\nWe know that climate changes with changed altitude as well as latitude.\r\nGoing up the side of a mountain, even in tropical regions, we may reach\r\nthe snow-line in the middle of summer. Magnolia trees and tree ferns\r\nonce grew luxuriantly in Greenland forests. Their fossil remains have\r\nbeen found in the rocks. This was long before the continent was lifted\r\ninto the altitude of ice and snow. And it is believed that the climate\r\nof northern latitudes has become more severe than formerly from other\r\ncauses. It is possible that the earth's orbit has gradually changed in\r\nform and position.\r\n\r\nIf Greenland should ever subside until the ancient beach rests again at\r\nsea-level, the secrets of that unknown land would be revealed by the\r\nmelting of the glacial sheet that overspreads it. Possibly it would turn\r\nout to be a mere flock of islands. We can only guess. North America had,\r\nnot so long ago, two-thirds of its area covered with an ice-sheet like\r\nthat of Greenland, and a climate as cold as Greenland's. At this time\r\nthe land was lifted two to three thousand feet higher than its present\r\nlevel. All of the rain fell as snow, and the ice accumulated and became\r\nthicker year by year. Instead of glaciers filling the gorges, a great\r\nice flood covered all the land, and pushed southward as far as the Ohio\r\nRiver on the east and Yellowstone Park in the west. The Rocky Mountains\r\nand some parts of the Appalachian system accumulated snow and formed\r\nlocal glaciers, separated from the vast ice-sheet.\r\n\r\nThe unstable crust of the earth began to sink at length, and gradually\r\nthe ice-sheet's progress southward was checked, and it began to recede\r\nby melting. All along the borders of this great fan-shaped ice-field\r\nwater accumulated from the melting, and flooded the streams which\r\ndrained it to the Atlantic and the Gulf. Icebergs broken off of the edge\r\nof the retiring ice-sheet floated in a great inland sea. The land sank\r\nlower and lower until the general level was five hundred to one thousand\r\nfeet lower than it now is. The climate became correspondingly warm, and\r\nthe icebergs melted away. Then the land rose again, and in time the\r\ninland sea was drained away into the ocean, except for the waters that\r\nremained in thousands of lakes great and small that now occupy the\r\nregion covered by the ice.\r\n\r\nAncient sea beaches mark the level of high water at the time that the\r\nflood followed the melting ice. On the shores of Lake Champlain, but\r\nnearly five hundred feet higher than the present level of the lake,\r\ncurious geologists have found many kinds of marine shells on a\r\nwell-marked old sea beach. The members of one exploring party in the\r\nsame region were surprised and delighted to come by digging upon the\r\nskeleton of a whale that had drifted ashore in the ancient days when\r\nthe inland sea joined the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nLake Ontario's ancient beach is five hundred feet above the present\r\nwater-level; Lake Erie's is two hundred fifty feet above it; Lake\r\nSuperior's three hundred thirty feet higher than the present beach. No\r\ndoubt when the water stood at the highest level, the Great Lakes formed\r\none single sheet of water which settled to a lower level as the rivers\r\nflowing south cut their channels deep enough to draw off the water\r\ntoward the Gulf. Lake Winnipeg is now the small remnant of a vast lake\r\nthe shores of which have been traced. The Minnesota River finally made\r\nits way into the Mississippi and drained this great area the stranded\r\nbeaches of which still remain. The name of Agassiz has been given to the\r\nancient lake formed by the glacial flood and drained away thousands of\r\nyears ago but not until it had built the terraced beach which locates it\r\non the geological map of the region.\r\n\r\nWhen the ice-sheet came down from the north it dragged along all of the\r\nsoil and loose rock material that lay in its path. With the boulders\r\nfrozen into its lower surface it scratched and grooved the firm bedrock\r\nover which it slid, and rounded it to a smooth and billowy surface. The\r\nprogress of the ice-sheet was southward, but it spread like a fan so\r\nthat its widening border turned to east and west.\r\n\r\nWhen it reached its southernmost limit and began to melt, it laid down a\r\ngreat ridge of unsorted rock material, remnants of which remain to this\r\nday,--the terminal moraine of the ancient ice-sheet. The line of this\r\nancient deposit starts on Long Island, crosses New Jersey and\r\nPennsylvania, then dips southward, following the general course of the\r\nOhio River to its mouth, forming bluffs in southern Ohio, Indiana, and\r\nIllinois. The line bends upward as it crosses central Missouri, a corner\r\nof Kansas, and eastern Nebraska, parallel with the course of the\r\nMissouri.\r\n\r\nAs the ice-sheet melted, boulders were dropped all over the Northern\r\nStates and Canada. These were both angular and rounded. In some places\r\nthey are scattered thickly over the surface and are so numerous as to be\r\na great hindrance to agriculture. In many places great boulders of\r\nthousands of tons weight are perched on very slight foundations, just\r\nwhere they lodged when the ice went off and left them, after carrying\r\nthem hundreds of miles. Around them are scattered quantities of loose\r\nrock material, not scored or ground as are those which were carried on\r\nthe under-surface of the glacial ice. These unscarred fragments rode on\r\nthe top of the ice. They were a part of the top moraine of the glacial\r\nsheet.\r\n\r\nThe finest material deposited is rock meal, ground by the great glacial\r\nmill, and called \"boulder clay.\" It is a stiff, dense, stony paste in\r\nwhich boulders of all sizes, gravel, pebbles, and cobblestones are\r\ncemented.\r\n\r\nThe \"drift\" of the ice-sheet is the rubbish, coarse and fine, it left\r\nbehind as it retreated. Below the Ohio River there is a deep soil\r\nproduced by the decay of rocks that lie under it. North of Ohio is\r\nspread that peculiar mixture of earth and rock fragments which was\r\ntransported from the north and spread over the land which the ice-sheet\r\nswept bare and ground smooth and polished.\r\n\r\nThe drift has been washed away in places by the floods that followed the\r\nice. Granite domes are thus exposed, the grooves and scratches of which\r\ntell in what direction the ice flood was travelling. Miles away from\r\nthat scored granite, but in the same direction as the scratches,\r\nscattered fragments of the same foundation rock cover fields and\r\nmeadows. Thus, much of the drift material can be traced to its original\r\nhome, and the course of the ice-sheet can be determined. Many immense\r\nboulders the home of which was in the northern highlands of Canada rode\r\nsouthward, frozen into icebergs that floated in the great inland sea.\r\nGreat quantities of débris were added to the original glacial drift\r\nthrough the agency of these floating ice masses, which melted by slow\r\ndegrees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOLLOWING SOME LOST RIVERS\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat would you think if the boat in which you were floating down a\r\npleasant river should suddenly grate upon sand, and you should look over\r\nthe gunwale and find that here the waters sank out of sight, the river\r\nended? I believe you would rub your eyes, and feel sure that you were\r\ndreaming. Do not all rivers flow along their beds, growing larger with\r\nevery mile, and finally empty their waters into a sea, or bay, or lake,\r\nor flow into some larger stream? This is the way of most rivers, but\r\nthere are exceptions. In the Far West there are some great rivers that\r\nabsolutely disappear before they reach a larger body of water. They\r\nsimply sink away into the sand, and sometimes reappear to finish their\r\ncourses after flowing underground for miles. Do you know the name of one\r\ngreat western river of which I am thinking? Is there any stream in your\r\nneighbourhood which has such peculiar ways?\r\n\r\nDown in Kentucky there is a region where, it is said, one may walk fifty\r\nmiles without crossing running water. In the middle of our country, in\r\nthe region of plentiful rainfall, and in a state covered with beautiful\r\nwoodlands and famous for blue grass and other grain crops, it is\r\namazing that, over a large area, brooks and larger streams are lacking.\r\nIn most of the state there is plenty of water flowing in streams like\r\nthose in other parts of the eastern half of the United States. In the\r\nnear neighbourhood of this peculiar section of the state the streams\r\ncome to an end suddenly, pouring their water into funnel-shaped\r\ndepressions of the ground called sink-holes. After a heavy rain the\r\nsurface water, accumulating in rivulets, may also be traced to small\r\ndepressions which seem like leaks in the earth's crust, into which the\r\nwater trickles and disappears.\r\n\r\nIt must have been noticed by the early settlers who came over the\r\nmountains from the eastern colonies, and settled in the new, wild, hilly\r\ncountry, which they called Kentucky. The first settlers built their log\r\ncabins along the streams they found, and shot deer and wild turkey and\r\nother game that was plentiful in the woods. The deer showed them where\r\nsalt was to be found in earthy deposits near the streams; for salt is\r\nnecessary to every creature. Deer trails led from many directions to the\r\n\"salt licks\" which the wild animals visited frequently.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the same pioneers who dug the salt out of the earth found\r\nlikewise deposits of _nitre_, called also _saltpetre_, a very precious\r\nmineral, for it is one of the elements necessary in the manufacture of\r\ngunpowder. With the Indians all about him, and often showing themselves\r\nunfriendly, the pioneer counted gunpowder a necessity of life. He relied\r\non his gun to defend and to feed his family. There were men among those\r\nfirst settlers who knew how to make gunpowder, and saltpetre was one of\r\nthe things that had to be carried across the mountains into Kentucky,\r\nuntil they found it in the hills. No wonder that prospectors went about\r\nlooking for nitre beds in the overhanging ledges of rocks along\r\nstream-beds. In such situations the deposits of nitre were found. The\r\nearth was washed in troughs of running water to remove the clayey\r\nimpurity. After a filtering through wood-ashes, the water which held the\r\nnitre in solution was boiled down, and left to evaporate, after which\r\nthe crystals of saltpetre remained.\r\n\r\nSolid masses of saltpetre weighing hundreds of pounds were sometimes\r\nfound in protected corners under shelving rocks. It was no doubt in the\r\nfascinating hunt for lumps of this pure nitre that the early prospectors\r\ndiscovered that the streams which disappeared into the sink-holes made\r\ntheir way into caverns underground. Digging in the sides of ravines\r\noften made the earthy wall cave in, and the surprised prospector stood\r\nat the door of a cavern. The discoverer of a cave had hopes that by\r\nentering he might find nitre beds richer than those he could uncover on\r\nthe surface, and this often turned out to be true. The hope of finding\r\nprecious metals and beds of iron ore also encouraged the exploration of\r\nthese caves. By the time the war of 1812 was declared, the mining of\r\nsaltpetre was a good-sized industry in Kentucky. Most of the mineral was\r\ntaken out of small caves, and shipped, when purified, over the\r\nmountains, on mule-back by trails, and in carts over good roads that\r\nwere built on purpose to bring this mineral product to market. As long\r\nas war threatened the country, the Government was ready to buy all the\r\nsaltpetre the Kentucky frontiersmen could produce. And the miners were\r\nconstantly in search of richer beds that promised better returns for\r\ntheir labour.\r\n\r\nIt was this search that led to the exploration of the caves discovered,\r\nalthough the explorer took his life in his hands when he left the\r\ndaylight behind him and plunged into the under-world.\r\n\r\nNot all lost rivers tell as interesting stories or reveal as valuable\r\nsecrets as did those the neighbours of Daniel Boone traced along their\r\ndark passages underground, and finally saw emerge as hillside springs,\r\nin many cases, to feed Kentucky rivers. But it is plain that no river\r\nsinks from sight unless it finds porous or honeycombed rocks that let it\r\nthrough. The water seeks the nearest and easiest route to the sea. Its\r\nweight presses toward the lowest level, always. The more water absorbs\r\nof acid, the more powerfully does it attack and carry away the substance\r\nof lime rocks through which it passes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MAMMOTH CAVE OF KENTUCKY\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no more fertile soil in the country than that of the famous\r\nblue grass region of Kentucky. The surface soil rests upon a deep\r\nfoundation of limestone rocks, and very gradually the plant food locked\r\nup in these underlying strata is pulled up to the surface by the soil\r\nwater, and greedily appropriated by the roots of the plants.\r\n\r\nPart of the water of the abundant rainfall of this region soaks into the\r\nlayers of the lime rock, carrying various acids in solution which give\r\nit power to dissolve the limestone particles, and thus to make its way\r\neasily through comparatively porous rock to the very depths of the\r\nearth. So it has come about that the surface of the earth is undermined.\r\nVast empty chambers have been carved by the patient work of trickling\r\nwater, which has carried away the lime that once formed solid and\r\ncontinuous layers of the earth's crust. We must believe that the work\r\nhas taken thousands of years, at least, for no perceptible change has\r\ncome to these wonderful caves since the discovery and exploration of\r\nthem a century and more ago.\r\n\r\nThe streams that flow into the region of these caves disappear suddenly\r\ninto sink-holes and flow through caverns. After wearing away their\r\nsubterranean channels, leaping down from one level to another, forming\r\nwaterfalls and lakes, some emerge finally through hillsides in the form\r\nof springs.\r\n\r\nThe cavern region of Kentucky covers eight thousand square miles. The\r\nunderground chambers found there are in the limestone rock which varies\r\nfrom ten to four hundred feet in thickness, and averages a little less\r\nthan two hundred feet. Over this territory the number of sink-holes\r\naverage one hundred to the square mile; and the streams that have poured\r\ntheir water into these basins have made a network of open caverns one\r\nhundred thousand miles in length.\r\n\r\nA great many small caverns have been thoroughly explored and are famous\r\nfor their beauty. The Diamond Cave is one of the most splendid, for it\r\nis lined with walls and pillars of alabaster that sparkle in the\r\ntorchlight with crystals that look like veritable diamonds. Beautiful\r\nsprings and waterfalls are found in many caves, but the grandest of all\r\nis the Mammoth Cave, beside which no other is counted worthy to be\r\ncompared.\r\n\r\nGreat tales the miners told of the wonder and the beauty of these\r\ncaverns, the walls of which were supported by arching alabaster columns\r\nand wonderful domes, of indescribable beauty of form and colouring. In\r\n1799, the year that Washington died, a pioneer discovered the entrance\r\nto a cave, the size and beauty of which surpassed anything he had seen\r\nbefore. After exploring it for a short distance he returned home and\r\ntook his whole family with him to enjoy the first view of the wonderful\r\ncavern he had discovered. They carried pine knots and a lighted torch,\r\nby which they made their way for some distance, but the torch was\r\naccidentally extinguished and they groped their way in darkness and\r\nmissed the entrance. Without anything to guide them, they wandered in\r\ndarkness for three days, and were almost dead when at last they stumbled\r\nupon the exit. This is the doorway of the Mammoth Cave of Kentucky, one\r\nof the wonders of the world.\r\n\r\nThis was a terrible experience. The next persons who attempted to\r\nexplore the new cave were better provisioned against the chance of\r\nspending some time underground. The pioneers found rich deposits of\r\nnitre in the \"Great Cave,\" as they called it. Scientists visited it and\r\nexplored many of its chambers. The reputation of this cavern has been\r\nspread by thousands of visitors who have come from all over the world to\r\nsee it. The cave has not yet been completely explored. The regular\r\ntours, on which the guides conduct visitors, cover but a small part of\r\nthe one hundred and fifty miles measured by the two hundred or more\r\navenues. The passages wind in and out, crossing each other, sometimes at\r\ndifferent levels, and forming a network of avenues in which the\r\nunaccustomed traveller would surely be lost. The old guides know every\r\ninch of their regular course, and their quaint and edifying talk adds\r\ngreatly to the pleasure of the visitors.\r\n\r\nFrom the hotel, parties are organized for ten o'clock in the morning and\r\nseven o'clock in the evening. Each visitor is provided with a lard-oil\r\nlamp. The guide carries a flask of oil and plenty of matches. No special\r\ngarb is necessary, though people usually dress for comfort, and wear\r\neasy shoes. The temperature of the cave is uniform winter and summer,\r\nvarying between fifty-three and fifty-four degrees Fahrenheit.\r\n\r\nThe cave entrance is an arch of seventy-foot span in the hillside. A\r\nwinding flight of seventy stone steps leads the party around a\r\nwaterfall, into a great chamber under the rocks. Then the way goes\r\nthrough a narrow passage, where the guide unlocks an iron gate to let\r\nthem in. The visitors now leave all thoughts of daylight behind, for the\r\nbreeze that put out their lights as they entered the cave is past, and\r\nthey stand in the Rotunda, a vast high-ceilinged chamber, silent and\r\nimpressive, with walls of creamy limestone, encrusted with gypsum, which\r\nhas been stained black by manganese. From the vestibule on, each passage\r\nand each room has a name, based upon some historic event or some fancied\r\nresemblance. The Giant's Coffin is a great kite-shaped rock lying in one\r\nof the rooms of the cave. The Star Chamber has a wonderful\r\ncrystal-studded dome in which the guide produces the effect of a sunrise\r\nby burning coloured lights. Bonfires built at suitable points produce\r\nwonderful shadow effects, which are like nothing else in the world. The\r\nold saltpetre vats which the visitors pass in taking the \"Long Route\"\r\nthrough the cave, point them back to the days during the War of 1812,\r\nwhen this valuable mineral was extracted from the earth in the floor of\r\nthe cave. The industry greatly enriched the thrifty owners of the cave,\r\nbut the works were abandoned after peace was declared.\r\n\r\nIt must be a wonderful experience to walk steadily for nine hours over\r\nthe Long Route, for so pure is the air and so wonderful is the scenery\r\nthat people rarely complain of fatigue when the experience is over.\r\nThere is no dust on the floors of these subterranean chambers, and they\r\nare not damp except near places where water trickles, here and there, in\r\nrivulets and cascades. Pools of water at the bottoms of pits so deep\r\nthat a lighted torch requires several seconds to reach the bottom, and\r\nrivers and lakes of considerable size, show where some of the surface\r\nwater goes to. A strange underground suction creates whirlpools in some\r\nof these streams. People go in boats holding twenty passengers for a row\r\non Echo River, and the guide dips up with a net the blind fish and\r\ncrayfish and cave lizards which inhabit these subterranean waters. The\r\nechoes in various chambers of the Mammoth Cave are remarkable. In some\r\nof them a song by a single voice comes back with full chords, as if\r\nseveral voices carried the different parts. The single notes of flute\r\nand cornet are returned with the same beautiful harmonies. A pistol shot\r\nis given back a dozen times, the sound rebounding like a ball from rock\r\nto rock of the arching walls. The vibrations of the water made by the\r\nrower's paddles reëcho in sounds like bell notes, and they are\r\nmultiplied into harmonies that suggest the chimes in the belfry of a\r\ncathedral.\r\n\r\nThe walls of various chambers differ from each other according to the\r\nminerals that compose them. Some are creamy white limestone arches, some\r\nare walled with black gypsum, some are hung with great curtains of\r\nstalagmites, solid but suggesting the lightness and grace of folds of\r\ncrêpe. Under such hangings the floor is built up in stalactites. The\r\nmineral-laden water, the constant drip of which has produced a hanging,\r\nicicle-like stalagmite, has built up the stalactite to meet it.\r\n\r\nProbably nothing is more beautiful than the flower-like crystals that\r\nbloom all over the walls of a chamber called \"Mary's Bower.\" The floor,\r\neven, sparkles with jewels that have fallen from the wonderful and\r\ndelicate flower clusters built from deposits of the lime-laden water\r\nwhich goes on building and replacing the bits that fall. \"Martha's\r\nVineyard\" is decorated with nodules, like bunches of grapes, that\r\nglisten as if the dew were on them. The white gypsum in some caves makes\r\nthe walls look as if they were carved out of snow. Still others have\r\nclear, transparent crystals that make them gleam in the torches' light\r\nas if the walls were encrusted with diamonds.\r\n\r\nThe cave region of Indiana is also famous. The great Wyandotte Cave in\r\nCrawford County is the most noted of many similar caverns. In some of\r\nthe chambers, bats are found clinging to the ceiling, heads downward,\r\nlike swarms of bees. The caverns of Luray, in Virginia, are complex and\r\nwonderful in their structure, and famous for the beautiful stalactites\r\nand stalagmites they contain. But there is no cave in this country so\r\nwonderful and so grand in its dimensions as the Mammoth Cave in\r\nKentucky.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLAND-BUILDING BY RIVERS\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce a year, when the rainy season comes in the mountainous country\r\nsouth of Egypt, the old Nile floods its banks and spreads its slimy\r\nwaters over the land, covering the low plains to the very edge of the\r\nSahara Desert. The people know it is coming, and are prepared for this\r\nflood. We should think such an overflow of our nearest river a monstrous\r\ncalamity, but the Egyptians bless the river which blesses them. They\r\nknow that without the Nile's overflow their country would be added to\r\nthe Desert of Sahara. In a short time after the overflow, the river\r\nreaches its highest point and begins to ebb. Canals lying parallel to\r\nits course are filled with water which is saved for use in the hot, dry\r\nsummer. As the flood goes down, a deposit of slimy mud lies as a rich\r\nfertilizer on the land. It is this and the water which the earth has\r\nabsorbed that make Egypt one of the most fertile agricultural countries\r\nin the world.\r\n\r\nThe region covered by the Nile's overflow is the flood plain of this\r\nriver. On this plain the Pyramids, the Sphinx, and other famous\r\nmonuments of Egypt stand. The statue of Rameses II. built 3,000 years\r\nago, has its base buried nine feet deep in the rich soil made of Nile\r\nsediment. A well dug in this region goes through forty feet of this soil\r\nbefore striking the underlying sand. How many years ago did the first\r\nNile overflow take place? We may begin our calculation by finding out\r\nthe average yearly deposit. It is a slow process that accumulates but\r\nnine feet in 3,000 years. If you were in Egypt when the Nile went back\r\ninto its banks, you would see that the scum it leaves in a single\r\noverflow adds not a great deal to the thickness of the soil. Possibly\r\nfloods have varied in their deposits from year to year, so that any\r\ncalculation of the time it took to build that forty feet of surface soil\r\nmust be but a rough estimate. This much we know: it has been an\r\nuninterrupted process which has taken place within the present\r\ngeological epoch, \"the Age of Man.\"\r\n\r\nNot all the rich sediment the Nile brings down is left on the level\r\nflood plain along its course. A vast quantity is dumped at the river's\r\nmouth, where the tides of the Mediterranean check the river's current.\r\nThus the great delta is formed. The broad river splits into many mouths\r\nthat spread out like a fan and build higher and broader each year the\r\nmud-banks between the streams. Upper Egypt consists of river swamps.\r\nLower Egypt, from Cairo to the sea, is the delta built by the river\r\nitself on sea bottom. From the head of the delta, where the river\r\ncommences to divide, to the sea, is an area of 10,000 square miles made\r\nout of material contributed by upper Egypt, and built by the river.\r\nLayer upon layer, it is constantly forming, but most rapidly during the\r\nseason of floods.\r\n\r\nComing closer home, let us look at the map of the Mississippi Valley.\r\nBegin as far north as St. Louis. For the rest of its course the\r\nMississippi River flows through a widening plain of swamp land, flooded\r\nin rainy seasons. Through this swampy flood plain the river meanders;\r\nits current, heavily loaded with sediment, swings from one side to the\r\nother of the channel, building up here, wearing away there, and\r\nstraightening its course when the curves become so sharp that their\r\nsides meet. Then the current breaks through the thin wall, and a bayou\r\nof still water is left behind.\r\n\r\nBelow Baton Rouge the Mississippi breaks into many mouths, that spread\r\nand carry the water of the great river into the Gulf of Mexico. The Nile\r\ndelta is triangular, like delta, [Greek: D], the fourth letter of the\r\nGreek alphabet; but the Mississippi's delta is very irregular. The main\r\nmouth of the river flows fifty miles out into the Gulf between\r\nmud-banks, narrow and low. At the tip it branches into several streams.\r\n\r\nFrom the mouth of the Ohio to the Gulf, the Mississippi flood plain\r\ncovers 30,000 square miles. Over this area, sediment to an average depth\r\nof fifty feet has been laid down. In earlier times the river flooded\r\nthis whole area, when freshets swelled its tributaries in the spring.\r\nThe flood plain then became a sea, in the middle of which the river's\r\ncurrent flowed swiftly. The slow-flowing water on each side of the main\r\ncurrent let go of its burden of sediment and formed a double ridge.\r\nBetween these two natural walls the main river flowed. When its level\r\nfell, two side streams, running parallel with the main river drained the\r\nflood plains on each side into the main tributaries to right and left.\r\nThese natural walls deposited when the river was in flood are called\r\n_levees_. Each heavy flood builds them higher, and the bed of the stream\r\nrises by deposits of sediment. So it happens that the level of the river\r\nbed is higher than the level of its flood plain.\r\n\r\nThis is an interesting fact in geology. But the people who have taken\r\npossession of the rich flood plain of the Mississippi River, who have\r\nbuilt their homes there, drained and cultivated the land, and built\r\ncities and towns on the areas reclaimed from swamps, recognize the\r\nelevation of the river bed as the greatest danger that threatens them.\r\nSuppose a flood should come. Even if it does not overflow the levees, it\r\nmay break through the natural banks and thus overflow the cities and the\r\nfarm lands to left and right.\r\n\r\nInstead of living in constant fear of such a calamity, the people of the\r\nMississippi flood plain have sought safety by making artificial levees,\r\nto make floods impossible. These are built upon the natural levees. As\r\nthe river bed rises by the deposit of mud, the levees are built higher\r\nto contain the rising waters. No longer does the rich soil of the\r\nMississippi flood plain receive layers of sediment from the river's\r\noverflow. The river very rarely breaks through a levee. The United\r\nStates Government has spent great sums in walling in the river, and each\r\nstate along its banks does its share toward paying for this\r\nself-protection.\r\n\r\nBy means of _jetties_ the river's current is directed into a\r\nstraightened course, and its power is expended upon the work of\r\ndeepening its own channel and carrying its sediment to the Gulf. Much as\r\nthe river has been forced to do in cleaning its own main channel,\r\ndredging is needed at various harbours to keep the river deep enough for\r\nnavigation. The forests of the mountain slopes in Colorado are being\r\nslaughtered, and the headwaters of the Missouri are carrying more and\r\nmore rocky débris to choke the current of the Mississippi. Colorado soil\r\nis stolen to build land in the vast delta, which is pushing out into the\r\nGulf at the rate of six miles in a century--a mile in every sixteen\r\nyears. The Mississippi delta measures 14,000 square miles. With the\r\ncontinued denuding of mountain slopes, we shall expect the rate of delta\r\ngrowth to be greatly increased, until reforesting checks the destructive\r\nwork of wind and water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MAKING OF MOUNTAINS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe gradual thickening and shrinking of the earth's crust as it cools\r\nhave made the wrinkles we call mountain systems. Through millions of\r\nyears the globe has been giving off heat to the cold sky spaces through\r\nwhich it swings in its orbit around the sun. The cooling caused the\r\ncontraction of the outer layer to fit the shrinking of the mass. When a\r\nplump peach dries on its pit, the skin wrinkles down to fit the dried\r\nflesh. The fruit shrinks by loss of water, just as the face of an old\r\nperson shrinks by loss of fat. The skin becomes wrinkled in both cases.\r\n\r\nThe weakest places in the earth's crust were the places to crumple,\r\nbecause they could not resist the lateral pressure that was exerted by\r\nthe shrinking process. Along the shores of the ancient seas the rivers\r\npiled great burdens of sediment. This caused the thin crust to sink and\r\nto become a basin alongside of a ridge. The wearing away of the land in\r\ncertain places lightened and weakened the crust at these places, so that\r\nit bent upward in a ridge.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the first wrinkles were not very high and deep. The gradual\r\ncooling must have exerted continued pressure, and the wrinkles have\r\nbecome larger. It is not likely that new wrinkles would be formed as\r\nlong as the old ones would crumple and draw up into narrower, steeper\r\nslopes, in response to the lateral crushing.\r\n\r\nWe can imagine those first mountains rising as folds under the sea.\r\nGradually their bases were narrowed, and their crests lifted out of the\r\nwater. They rose as long, narrow islands, and grew in size as time went\r\non.\r\n\r\nWhy is the trend of the great mountain systems almost always north and\r\nsouth? Study the map of the continents and see how few cross ranges are\r\nshown, and how short they are, compared with the others. The molten\r\nglobe bulged at its equator, as it rotated on its axis. The moon added\r\nits strong pulling force to make it bulge still more. As the crust\r\nthickened, it became less responsive to the two forces that caused it to\r\nbulge. The shrinkage was greatest where the globe had been most pulled\r\nout of shape. The rate of the earth's rotation is believed to have\r\ndiminished. Every change tended to let the earth draw in its (imaginary)\r\nbelt, a notch at a time. The forces of contraction acted along the line\r\nof the equator, and formed folds running toward the poles. In this early\r\ntime the great mountain systems were born, and they grew in size\r\ngradually, from small beginnings.\r\n\r\nThese mountains of upheaval, made by the bending of the earth's crust,\r\nand the formation of alternating ridges and depressed valleys, are many.\r\nThe earth is old and much wrinkled. Other mountains have been formed by\r\nforces quite different. Volcanic mountains have been far more numerous\r\nin ages gone than they are now.\r\n\r\nMt. Hood and Mt. Rainier are peaks built up by the materials thrown out\r\nof the craters of volcanoes dead these thousands of years. Vesuvius is\r\nat present showing us how volcanic mountains are made. Each eruption\r\nbuilds larger the cone--that is, the chimney through which the molten\r\nrocks, the ashes, and the steam are ejected. Side craters may open, the\r\nmain cone be broken and its form changed, but the mass of lava and\r\nstones and ashes grows with each eruption. The mountain grows by the\r\nadditions it receives. Ætna is a mountain built of lava.\r\n\r\nA third mountain system grew, not by addition, but by subtraction. The\r\nCatskills illustrate this type. This group of mountains is the remnant\r\nof a table-land made of level layers of red sandstone. The rest of the\r\nhigh plain has been cut down and carried away, leaving these picturesque\r\nhills, the survival of which is as much a mystery as the disappearance\r\nof the balance of the plateau of which they were once a part.\r\n\r\nThe fold that forms a typical mountain ridge has a cone of granite, the\r\noriginal rock foundation of the earth, and on this are layers of\r\nstratified rock, ancient deposits of sediment carried to the sea by\r\nstreams. When exposed to wind and rain, the ridge is gradually worn\r\ndown. In some places the water cuts away the soft rock and forms a\r\nstream-bed, that cuts deeper and deeper, using the rock fragments as its\r\ntools. Often the layers of aqueous rocks are cut through, and the\r\ngranite exposed.\r\n\r\nSometimes the hardest stratified rock-beds resist the water and the wind\r\nand are left as a series of ridges along the sides of the main range.\r\nThe crumpling forces may crack the ridge open for its whole length, and\r\none side of the chasm may slip down and the other go up. The result is a\r\nsheer wall of exposed rock strata, layers of which correspond with those\r\nthat lie far below the top of the portion that slid down in the great\r\nupheaval and subsidence that parted them. These slips are known as\r\n_faults_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LAVA FLOOD OF THE NORTHWEST\r\n\r\n\r\nWe know little about the substance that occupies the four thousand miles\r\nof distance between the surface and the centre of our earth. We know\r\nthat the terrible weight borne by the central mass compresses it, so\r\nthat the interior must grow denser as the core is approached. Scientists\r\nhave weighed the earth, and tell us that the crust is lighter than the\r\nrest. The supposition is that there is a great deal of iron in the\r\ninterior, and possibly precious metals, too.\r\n\r\nOur deepest wells and mines go down about a mile, then digging stops, on\r\naccount of the excessive heat. But the crumpling of the crust, and the\r\nwearing away of the folded strata by wind and running water, have laid\r\nbare rocks several miles in thickness on the slopes of mountains, and\r\nexposed the underlying granite, on which the first sedimentary rocks\r\nwere deposited. On this granite lie stratified rocks, which are\r\ncrystalline in texture. These are the beds, sometimes miles in depth,\r\ncalled _metamorphic_ rocks, formed by water, then transformed by heat.\r\n\r\nThe wearing away of rocks by wind and water has furnished the materials\r\nout of which the aqueous rocks have been made. Layers upon layers of\r\nsandstone, shales, limestone, and the like, are exposed when a river\r\ncuts a canyon through a plateau. The layered deposits of débris at the\r\nmouth of the river make new aqueous rocks out of old. Every sandy beach\r\nis sandstone in the making. This work is never ended.\r\n\r\nIn the early days the earth's crust often gaped open in a mighty crater\r\nand let a flood of lava overspread the surface. The ocean floor often\r\nreceived this flood of melted rock. In many places the same chimney\r\nopened again and again, each time spreading a new layer of lava on top\r\nof the old, so that the surface has several lava sheets overlying the\r\naqueous strata.\r\n\r\nIf the hardened lava sheet proved a barrier to the rising tide of molten\r\nlava in the chimney it was often forced out in sheets between the layers\r\nof aqueous rocks. Wherever the heated material came into contact with\r\naqueous rocks it transformed them, for a foot or more, into crystalline,\r\nmetamorphic rocks.\r\n\r\nA chimney of lava is called a _dike_. In mountainous countries dikes are\r\ncommon. Sometimes small, they may also be hundreds of feet across, often\r\nstanding high above the softer strata, which rains have worn away. Dikes\r\noften look like ruined walls, and may be traced for miles where they\r\nhave been overturned in the mountain-making process.\r\n\r\nThe great lava flood of the Northwest happened when the Coast Range was\r\nborn. Along the border of the Pacific Ocean vast sedimentary deposits\r\nhad accumulated during the Cretaceous and Tertiary Periods. Then the\r\nmighty upheaval came, the mountain ridge rose at the end of the Miocene\r\nepoch and stretched itself for hundreds of miles through the region\r\nwhich is now the coast of California and Oregon. Great fissures opened\r\nin the folded crust, and floods of lava overspread an area of 150,000\r\nsquare miles. A dozen dead craters show to-day where those immense\r\nvolcanic chimneys were. The depth of the lava-beds is well shown where\r\nthe Columbia River has worn its channel through. Walls of lava three\r\nthousand feet in thickness rise on each side of the river. They are made\r\nof columns of basalt, fitted together, like cells of a honeycomb, and\r\njointed, forming stone blocks laid one upon another. The lava shrinks on\r\ncooling and forms prisms. In Ireland, the Giants' Causeway is a famous\r\nexample of basaltic formation. In Oregon, the walls of the Des Chutes\r\nRiver show thirty lava layers, each made of vertical basalt columns. The\r\npalisades of the Hudson, Mt. Tom, and Mt. Holyoke are examples on the\r\neastern side of the continent of basaltic rocks made by lava floods.\r\n\r\nNorthern California, northwestern Nevada, and large part of Idaho,\r\nMontana, Oregon, and Washington are included in the basin filled with\r\nlava at the time of the great overflow, which extended far into British\r\nColumbia. It is probable that certain chimneys continued to discharge\r\nuntil comparatively recent times. Mt. Rainier, Mt. Shasta, and Mt. Hood\r\nare among dead volcanoes.\r\n\r\nQuite a different history has the great Deccan lava-field of India,\r\nwhich covers a larger area than the basin of our Northwest, and is in\r\nplaces more than a mile in depth. It has no volcanoes, nor signs of any\r\never having existed. The floods alone overspread the region, which shows\r\nno puny \"follow-up system\" of scattered craters, intermittently in\r\neruption.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST LIVING THINGS\r\n\r\n\r\nStrange days and nights those must have been on the earth when the great\r\nsea was still too hot for living things to exist in it. The land above\r\nthe water-line was bare rocks. These were rapidly being crumbled by the\r\naction of the air, which was not the mild, pleasant air we know, but was\r\nfull of destructive gases, breathed out through cracks in the thin crust\r\nof the earth from the heated mass below. If you stand on the edge of a\r\nlava lake, like one of those on the islands of the Hawaiian group, the\r\nstifling fumes that rise might make you feel as if you were back at the\r\nbeginning of the earth's history, when the solid crust was just a thin\r\nfilm on an unstable sea of molten rock, and this volcano but one of the\r\nvast number of openings by which the boiling lava and the condensed\r\ngases found their way to the surface. Then the rivers ran black with the\r\nwaste of the rocky earth they furrowed, and there was no vegetation to\r\nsoften the bleakness of the landscape.\r\n\r\nThe beginnings of life on the earth are a mystery. Nobody can guess the\r\nriddle. The earliest rocks were subjected to great heat. It is not\r\npossible that life could have existed in the heated ocean or on the\r\nland. Gradually the shores of the seas became filled up with sediment\r\nwashed down by the rivers. Layer on layer of this sediment accumulated,\r\nand it was crumpled by pressure, and changed by heat, so that if any\r\nplants or animals had lived along those old shores their remains would\r\nhave been utterly destroyed.\r\n\r\nRocks that lie in layers on top of these oldest, fire-scarred\r\nfoundations of the earth show the first faint traces of living things.\r\nLimestone and beds of iron ore are signs of the presence of life. The\r\nfirst animals and plants lived in the ancient seas.\r\n\r\nFrom the traces that are left, we judge that the earliest life forms\r\nwere of the simplest kind, like some plants and animals that swim in a\r\ndrop of water. Have you ever seen a drop of pond water under a compound\r\nmicroscope? It is a wonder world you look into, and you forget all the\r\nworld besides. You are one of the wonderful higher animals, the highest\r\non the earth. You focus on a shapeless creature that moves about and\r\nfeels and breathes, but hasn't any eyes or mouth or stomach--in fact, it\r\nis the lowest form of animal life, and one of the smallest. It is but\r\none of many animal forms, all simple in structure, but able to feed and\r\ngrow and reproduce their kind.\r\n\r\nGaze out of the window on the garden, now. The flowering plants, the\r\ngreen grass, and the trees are among the highest forms of plants. In the\r\ndrop of water under the microscope tiny specks of green are floating.\r\nThey belong to the lowest order of plants. Among the plant and the\r\nanimal forms that have been studied and named, are a few living things\r\nthe places of which in the scale are not agreed upon. Some say they are\r\nanimals; some believe they are plants. They are like both in some\r\nrespects. It is probable that the first living things were like these\r\nconfusing, minute things--not distinctly plants or animals, but the\r\nparent forms from which, later on, both plants and animals sprang.\r\n\r\nThe lowest forms of life, plant and animal, live in water to-day. They\r\nare tiny and their bodies are made of a soft substance like the white of\r\nan egg. If these are at all like the living creatures that swarmed in\r\nthe early seas, no wonder they left no traces in the rocks of the early\r\npart of the age when life is first recorded by fossils. Soft-bodied\r\ncreatures never do.\r\n\r\nSome of the animals and the plants in the drop of water under the\r\nmicroscope have body walls of definite shapes, made of lime, or of a\r\nglassy substance called silica. When they die, these \"skeletons\" lie at\r\nthe bottom of the water, and do not decay, as the living part of the\r\nbody does, because they are mineral. Gradually a number of these shells,\r\nor hard skeletons, accumulate. In a glass of pond water they are found\r\nat the bottom, amongst the sediment. In a pond how many thousands of\r\nthese creatures must live and their shells fall to the bottom at last,\r\nburied in the mud!\r\n\r\nSo it is easy to understand why the first creatures on earth left no\r\ntrace. The first real fossils found in the rocks are the hard shells or\r\nskeletons of the first plants and animals that had hard parts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN ANCIENT BEACH AT EBB TIDE\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the tide is out, the rocks on the Maine coast have plenty of living\r\ncreatures to prove this northern shore inhabited. Starfishes lurk in the\r\nhollows, and the tent-shaped shells of the little periwinkle encrust the\r\nwet rocks. Mussels cling to the rocks in clumps, fastened to each other\r\nby their ropes of coarse black hair. The furry coating of sea mosses\r\nthat encrust the rocks is a hiding-place for many kinds of living\r\nthings, some soft-bodied, some protected by shells. The shallow water is\r\nthe home of plants and animals of many different kinds. As proof of this\r\none finds dead shells and fragments of seaweeds strewn on the shore\r\nafter a storm.\r\n\r\nAlong the outer shores of the Cape Cod peninsula and down the Jersey\r\ncoast, the sober colouring of the shells of the north gives way to a\r\nbrighter colour scheme. In the warmer waters, life becomes gayer, if we\r\nmay judge by the rich tints that ornament the shells. The kinds of\r\nliving creatures change. They are larger and more abundant. The seaweeds\r\nare more varied and more luxuriant in growth.\r\n\r\nWhen we reach the shores of the West Indian islands and the keys of\r\nFlorida the greatest abundance and variety of living forms are found.\r\nThe submerged rocks blossom with flower-like sea anemones of every\r\ncolour. Corals, branching like trees and bushes on the sea floor, form\r\ngroves under water. Among them brilliant-hued fishes swim, and highly\r\nornamented shells glide, as people know who have gazed through the glass\r\nbottoms of the boats built especially to show visitors the wonderful sea\r\ngardens at Nassau, Bahama Islands, and at Santa Catalina Island,\r\nsouthern California.\r\n\r\nOn every beach the skeletons of animals which die help to build up the\r\nland; though the process is not so rapid in the north as on the shores\r\nthat approach the tropics. The coast of Florida has a rim of island\r\nreefs around it built out of coral limestone. Indeed, the peninsula was\r\nbuilt by coral polyps. Houses in St. Augustine are built of coquina\r\nrock, which is simply a mass of broken shells held together by a lime\r\ncement. Every sea beach is packed with shells and other remnants of\r\nanimals and plants that live in the shallow waters. Deeper and deeper\r\nyear by year the sand buries these skeletons, and many of them are\r\npreserved for all time.\r\n\r\nThus what is sandy beach to-day may, a few million years from now, be\r\nuncovered as a ledge of sandstone with the prints of waves distinctly\r\nshown, and fossil shells of molluscs, skeletons of fishes, and branches\r\nof seaweed--all of them different from those then growing upon the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nIn the neighbourhood of Cincinnati there have been uncovered banks of\r\nstone accumulated along the border of an ancient sea. From the sides of\r\ngranite highlands streams brought down the sand built into these oldest\r\nsandstone rocks. The fine mud which now appears as beds of slate was the\r\ndecay of feldspar and hornblende in the same granite. Limestone beds are\r\nfull of the fossil shells of creatures that lived in the shallow seas.\r\nTheir skeletons, accumulating on the bottom, formed deep layers of\r\nlimestone mud. These rocks preserve, by the fossils they contain, a\r\ngreat variety of shellfish which had limy skeletons. The sea fairly\r\nswarmed along its shallow margin with these creatures. We might not\r\nrecognize many of the shells and other curious fossils we find in the\r\nrock uncovered by the workmen who are cutting a railroad embankment.\r\nThey are not exactly like the living forms that grow along our beaches\r\nto-day, but they are enough like them for us to know that they lived\r\nalong the seashore, and if we had time to examine all the rocks of this\r\nkind preserved in a museum we should decide that seashore life was quite\r\nas abundant then as it is now. The pressed specimens of plants of those\r\nearliest seashores are mere imprints showing that they were pulpy and\r\ntherefore gradually decayed. Only their shape is recorded by dark stains\r\nmade by each branching part. The decay of the vegetable tissue painted\r\nthe outline on the rock which when split apart shows us what those\r\nancient seaweeds looked like. They belonged to the group of plants we\r\ncall kelp, or tangle, which are still common enough in the sea, though\r\nthe forms we now have are not exactly like the old ones. Seaweeds belong\r\nto the very lowest forms of plants.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Crinoid from Indiana]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _By permission of the American Museum of Natural History_\r\n\r\nAmmonite from Jurassic of England]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _By permission of the American Museum of Natural History_\r\n\r\nFossil corals Coquina, Hippurite limestone]\r\n\r\nThe limestones are full of fossils of corals. Indeed, there must have\r\nbeen reefs like those that skirt Florida to-day built by these\r\nlime-building polyps. Their forms are so well preserved in the rocks\r\nthat it is possible to know just how they looked when they grew in the\r\nshallows.\r\n\r\nOne very common kind is called a cup coral, because the polyp formed a\r\nskeleton shaped like a cup. The body wall surrounded the skeleton, and\r\nthe arms or tentacles rose from the centre of the funnel-like depression\r\nin the top. Little cups budded off from their parents, but remained\r\nattached, and at length the skeletons of all formed great masses of limy\r\nrock. Some cup corals grew in a solid mass, the new generation forming\r\nan outer layer, thus burying the parent cups.\r\n\r\nA second type of corals in these oldest limestones is the honeycomb\r\ngroup. The colonies of polyps lived in tubes which lengthened gradually,\r\nforming compact, limy cylinders like organ pipes, fitted close together.\r\nThe living generation always inhabited the upper chambers of the tubes.\r\nA third type is the chain coral, made of tubes joined in rows, single\r\nfile like pickets of a fence. But these walls bend into curious\r\npatterns, so that the cross-section of a mass of them looks like a\r\ncomplex pattern of crochet-work, the irregular spaces fenced with chain\r\nstitches. Each open link is a pit in which a polyp lived.\r\n\r\nAmong the corals are sprays of a fine feathery growth embedded in the\r\nlimestone. Fine, straight, splinter-like branches are saw-toothed on one\r\nor both edges. These limy fossils might not be seen at all, were they\r\nnot bedded in shales, which are very fine-grained. Here again are the\r\nskeletons of animals. Each notch on each thread-like branch was the home\r\nof a tiny animal, not unlike a sea anemone and a coral polyp.\r\n\r\nTo believe this story it is necessary only to pick up a bit of dead\r\nshell or floating driftwood on which a feathery growth is found. These\r\nplumes, like \"sea mosses,\" as they are called, are not plants at all,\r\nbut colonies of polyps. Each one lived in a tiny pit, and these pits\r\nrange one above the other, so as to look like notches on the thread-like\r\ndivisions of the stem. Put a piece of this so-called \"sea moss\" in a\r\nglass of sea water, and in a few moments of quiet you will see, by the\r\nuse of a magnifying glass, the spreading arms of the polyp thrust out of\r\neach pit.\r\n\r\nThe ancient seas swarmed with these living hydrozoans, and their remains\r\nare found preserved as fossils in the shales which once were beds of\r\nsoft mud.\r\n\r\nThe hard shells of sea urchins and starfishes are made of lime. In the\r\nancient seas, starfishes were rare and sea urchins did not exist, but\r\nall over the sea bottom grew creatures called crinoids, the soft parts\r\nof which were enclosed in limy protective cases and attached to rocks on\r\nthe sea bottom by means of jointed stems. No fossils are more plentiful\r\nin the early limestones than these wonderful \"stone lilies.\" Indeed, the\r\ncrinoidal limestone seemed to be built of the skeletons of these\r\nanimals. The lily-like body was flung open, as a lily opens its calyx,\r\nwhen the creature was feeding. But any alarm caused the tentacles to be\r\ndrawn in, and the petal-like divisions of the body wall to close tightly\r\ntogether, till that wall looked like an unopened bud.\r\n\r\nOn the bottom of the Atlantic, near the Bahama Islands, these stone\r\nlilies are still found growing. Their jointed stems and body parts are\r\nas graceful in form and motion as any lily. The creature's mouth is in\r\nthe centre of the flower-like top, and it feeds like the sea urchin, on\r\nparticles obtained in the sea water.\r\n\r\nThe old limestones contain great quantities of \"lamp shells,\" which are\r\nold-fashioned bivalves. Their shells remind us of our bivalve clams and\r\nscallops, but the internal parts were very different. The gills of clams\r\nand oysters are soft parts. Inside of the lamp shells are coiled, bony\r\narms, supporting the fringed gills.\r\n\r\nIt is fortunate for us that a few lamp shells still live in the seas. By\r\nstudying the soft parts of these living remnants of a very old race we\r\ncan know the secrets of the lives of those ancient lamp shells, the\r\nsoft parts of which were all washed away, and the fossil shells of which\r\nare preserved. Gradually the lamp shells died out, and the modern\r\nbivalves have come to take their places. Just so, the ancient crinoids\r\nare now almost extinct; the sea urchins and the starfishes have\r\nsucceeded them.\r\n\r\nThe chambered nautilus has its shell divided by partitions and it lives\r\nin the outer chamber, a many-tentacled creature, that is a close\r\nrelative of the soft-bodied squid. In the ancient seas the same family\r\nwas represented by huge creatures the shells of which were chambered,\r\nbut not coiled. Their abundance and great size are proved by the rocks\r\nin which their fossils are preserved. Some of them must have been the\r\nrulers of the sea, as sharks and whales are to-day. Fossil specimens\r\nhave been found more than fifteen feet long and ten inches in diameter\r\nin the ancient rocks of some of the Western States. It is possible to\r\nread from the lowest rock formations upward, the rise of these sea\r\ngiants and their gradual decline. Certain strata of limestone contain\r\nthe last relics of this race, after which they became extinct. As the\r\nstraight-chambered forms diminished, great coiled forms became more\r\nabundant, but all died out.\r\n\r\nOne of the most abundant fossil animals in ancient rocks is called a\r\ntrilobite. Its body is divided by two grooves into three parts, a\r\ncentral ridge extending the whole length of the body and two side\r\nridges. The front portion of the shell formed the head shield, and\r\nbehind the main body part was a little tail shield. The skeleton was\r\nformed of many movable jointed plates, and the creature had eyes set in\r\nthe head shield just as the king crab's are set. Jointed legs in pairs\r\nfringed each side of the body. Each leg had two branches, one for\r\nwalking, the other for swimming. A pair of feelers rose from the head.\r\nThe body could be rolled into a ball when danger threatened, by bringing\r\nhead and tail together.\r\n\r\nThese remarkable, extinct trilobites were the first crustaceans. Their\r\nnearest living relative to-day is the horseshoe crab. The fresh-water\r\ncrayfish and the lobster are more distant relatives: so are the shrimps\r\nand the prawns. No such abundance of these creatures exists to-day as\r\nexisted when the trilobites thronged the shallows. So well preserved are\r\nthese skeletons that, although there are no living trilobites for\r\ncomparison, it is possible to find out from the fossil enough about\r\ntheir structure to know how they fed and lived their lives along with\r\nthe straight-horns which were the scavengers of those early seas and the\r\nterror of smaller creatures. The trilobites throve, and, dying, left\r\ntheir record in the rocks; then disappeared entirely. We find their\r\nfossils in a great variety of forms, shapes, and sizes. The smallest is\r\nbut a fraction of an inch long, the largest twenty inches long.\r\n\r\nThe ancient rocks, in which these lower forms of life have left their\r\nfossils, are known as the Silurian system. The time in which these rocks\r\nwere accumulating under the seas covers a vast period. We call it the\r\nAge of Invertebrates, because these soft-bodied, hard-shelled animals,\r\nthe crinoids, the molluscs, and the trilobites, with bony external\r\nskeletons and no backbones, were the most abundant. They overshadowed\r\nall other forms of life. The rocks of this wonderful series were formed\r\non the shores of a great inland sea that covered the central portion of\r\nNorth America. In the ages that followed, these rocks were covered\r\ndeeply with later sediments. But the upheavals of the crust have broken\r\nopen and erosion has uncovered these strata in different regions.\r\nGeologists have found written there, page upon page, the record of life\r\nas it existed in the early seas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LIME ROCKS\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Hard\" water and \"soft\" water are very different. The rain that falls\r\nand fills our cisterns is not softer or more delightful to use than the\r\nwell water in some favoured regions. In it, soap makes beautiful, creamy\r\nsuds, and it is a real pleasure to put one's hands into it. But in hard\r\nwater soap seems to curdle, and some softening agent like borax has to\r\nbe added or the water will chap the hands. There is little satisfaction\r\nin using water of this kind for any purpose.\r\n\r\nHard water was as soft as any when it fell from the sky; but the rain\r\nwater trickled into the ground and passed through rocks containing lime.\r\nSome of this mineral was absorbed, for lime is readily soluble in water.\r\nClear though it may be, water that has lime in it has quite a different\r\nfeeling from rain water. Blow the breath into a basin of hard water, and\r\na milky appearance will be noted. The carbonic acid gas exhaled from the\r\nlungs unites with the invisible lime, causing it to become visible\r\nparticles of carbonate of lime, which fall to the bottom of the basin.\r\n\r\nNearly all well water is hard. So is the water of lakes and rivers and\r\nthe ocean, for limestone is one of the most widely distributed rocks in\r\nthe surface of the earth. Rain water makes its way into the earth's\r\ncrust, absorbs mineral substances, and collects in springs which feed\r\nbrooks and rivers and lakes. Wells are holes in the ground which bore\r\ninto water-soaked strata of sand.\r\n\r\nWe gain something from the lime dissolved in hard water, for it is an\r\nessential part of our food. We must drink a certain amount of water each\r\nday to keep the body in perfect health. The lime in this water goes\r\nchiefly to the building of our bones. Plant roots take up lime in the\r\nwater that mounts as sap through the plant bodies. We get some of the\r\nlime we need in vegetable foods we eat.\r\n\r\nAll of the kingdom of vertebrate animals, from the lowest forms to the\r\nhighest, all of the shell-bearing animals of sea and land, require lime.\r\nMany of the lower creatures especially these in the sea, such as corals\r\nand their near relatives, encase themselves in body walls of lime. They\r\nabsorb the lime from the sea water, and deposit it as unconsciously as\r\nwe build the bony framework of our bodies.\r\n\r\nAll the bone and shell-bearing creatures that die on the earth and in\r\nthe sea restore to the land and to the water the lime taken by the\r\ncreatures while they lived. Carbonic acid gas in the water greatly\r\nhastens the dissolving of dead shells. Carbonic acid gas, whether free\r\nin the air, or absorbed by percolating water, hastens the dissolving of\r\nskeletons of creatures that die upon land. Then the raw materials are\r\nbuilt again into lime rocks underground.\r\n\r\nThe lime rocks are the most important group in the list of rocks that\r\nform the crust of the earth. They are made of the elements calcium,\r\ncarbon, and oxygen, yet the different members of this calcite group\r\ndiffer widely in composition and appearance. So do oyster shells and\r\nbeef bones, though both contain quantities of carbonate of lime.\r\n\r\nCalcite is a soft mineral, light in weight, sometimes white, but oftener\r\nof some other colour. It may be found crystallized or not. Whenever a\r\ndrop of acid touches it, a frothy effervescence occurs. The drop of acid\r\nboils up and gives off the pungent odour of carbonic acid gas.\r\n\r\nThe reason that calcite is hard to find in rocks is that percolating\r\nwater, charged with acids, is constantly stealing it, and carrying it\r\naway into the ocean. The rocks that contain it crumble because the limy\r\nportions have been dissolved out.\r\n\r\nSome limestones resist the destructive action of water. When they are\r\nimpregnated with silica they become transformed into marble, which takes\r\na high polish like granite. Acids must be strong to make any impression\r\non marble.\r\n\r\nThe thick beds of pure limestone that underlie the surface soil in\r\nKentucky and in parts of Virginia sometimes measure several hundred feet\r\nin thickness, a single stratum often being twenty feet thick. They are\r\nall horizontal, for they were formed on sea bottom, and have not been\r\ncrumpled in later time. The dead bodies of sea creatures contributed\r\ntheir shells and skeletons to the lime deposit on the sea bottom. Who\r\ncan estimate the time it took to form those thick, solid layers of lime\r\nrock? The animals were corals, crinoids, and molluscs. Little sand and\r\nclay show in the lime rock of this period, before the marshes of the\r\nCarboniferous Age took the place of the ancient inland sea of the\r\nSubcarboniferous Period, the sedimentary accumulations of which we are\r\nnow talking about.\r\n\r\nThe living corals one sees in the shallow water of the Florida coast\r\nto-day are building land by building up their limy skeletons. The reefs\r\nare the dead skeletons of past generations of these tiny living things.\r\nThey take in lime from the water, and use it as we use lime in building\r\nour bones. In each case it is an unconscious process of animal\r\ngrowth--not a \"building process\" like a mason's building of a wall. Many\r\npeople think that the coral polyp builds in this way. They give it\r\ncredit for patience in a great undertaking. All the polyp does is to\r\nfeed on whatever the water supplies that its digestive organs can use.\r\nIt is like a sea anemone in appearance and in habits of life. It is not\r\nat all like an insect. Yet it is common to hear people speak of the\r\n\"coral insect\"! Do not let any one ever hear you repeat such a mistake.\r\n\r\nSouthern Florida is made out of coral rock, but thinly covered with\r\nsoil. It was made by the growth of reef after reef, and it is still\r\ngrowing.\r\n\r\nThe Cretaceous Period of the earth's eventful history is named for the\r\nlime rock which we know as chalk. Beds of this recent kind of limestone\r\nare found in England and in France, pure white, made of the skeletons of\r\nthe smallest of lime-consuming creatures, Foraminifera. They swarmed in\r\ndeep water, and so did minute sponge animalcules and plant forms called\r\nDiatoms that took silica from the water, and formed their hard parts of\r\nthis glassy substance. The result is seen in the nodules of flint found\r\nin the soft, snow-white chalk. Did you ever use a piece of chalk that\r\nscratched the black-board? The flint did it. Have you ever seen the\r\nchalk cliffs of Dover? When you do see them, notice how they gleam white\r\nin the sun. See how the rains have sculptured those cliffs. The\r\nprominences left standing out are strengthened by the flint they\r\ncontain. Chalk beds occur in Texas and under our great plains; but the\r\nprincipal rocks of the age in America were sandstones and clays.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AGE OF FISHES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first animal with a backbone recorded its existence among the\r\nfossils found in rocks of the upper Silurian strata. It is a fish; but\r\nthe earliest fossils are very incomplete specimens. We know that these\r\nold-fashioned fishes were somewhat like the sturgeons of our rivers.\r\nTheir bodies were encased in bony armour of hard scales, coated with\r\nenamel. The bones of the spine were connected by ball and socket joints,\r\nand the heads were movable. In these two particulars the fishes\r\nresembled reptiles. The modern gar-pike has a number of the same\r\ncharacteristics.\r\n\r\nAnother backboned creature of the ancient seas was the ancestral type of\r\nthe shark family. In some points this old-fashioned shark reminds us of\r\nbirds and turtles. These early fishes foreshadowed all later\r\nvertebrates, not yet on the earth. After them came the amphibians, then\r\nthe reptiles, then the birds, and latest the mammals.\r\n\r\nThe race of fishes began, no doubt, with forms so soft-boned that no\r\nfossil traces are preserved in the rocks. When those with harder bones\r\nappeared, the fossil record began, and it tells the story of the passing\r\nof the early, unfish-like forms, and the coming of new kinds, great in\r\nsize and in numbers, that swarmed in the seas, and were tyrants over all\r\nother living things. They conquered the giant straight-horns and\r\ntrilobites, former rulers of the seas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _By permission of the American Museum of Natural History_\r\n\r\nA sixteen-foot fossil fish from Cretaceous of Kansas, with a modern\r\ntarpon]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _By permission of the American Museum of Natural History_\r\n\r\nCañon Diablo meteorite from Arizona]\r\n\r\nOne of these giant fishes fifteen to twenty feet long, three feet wide,\r\nhad jaws two feet long, set with blade-like teeth. Devonian rocks in\r\nOhio have yielded fine fossils of gigantic fishes and sharks.\r\n\r\nDevonian fishes were unlike modern kinds in these particulars, the\r\nspinal column extended to the end of the tail, whether the fins were\r\narranged equally or unequally on the sides; the paired side fins look\r\nlike limbs fringed with fins. Every Devonian fish of the gar type seems\r\nto have had a lung to help out its gill-breathing.\r\n\r\nIn these traits the first fishes were much like the amphibians. They\r\nwere the parent stock from which branched later the true fishes and the\r\namphibians, as a single trunk parts into two main boughs. The trunk is\r\nthe connecting link.\r\n\r\nThe sea bottom was still thronged with crinoids, and lamp shells, and\r\ncup corals. Shells of both clam and snail shapes are plentiful. The\r\nchambered straight-horns are fewer and smaller, and coiled forms of this\r\ntype of shell are found. Trilobite forms are smaller, and their numbers\r\ndecrease.\r\n\r\nThe first land plants appeared during this age. Ferns and giant club\r\nmosses and cycads grew in swampy ground. This was the beginning of the\r\nwonderful fern forests that marked the next age, when coal was formed.\r\n\r\nThe rocks that bear the record of these living things in their fossils,\r\nform strata of great thickness that overlie the Silurian deposits. There\r\nis no break between them. So we understand that the sea changed its\r\nshore-line only when the Silurian deposits rose to the water-level.\r\n\r\nThe Devonian sea was smaller than the Silurian. A great tract of\r\nDevonian deposits occupies the lower half of the state of New York,\r\nCanada between Lakes Erie and Huron, and the northern portions of\r\nIndiana and Illinois. These older layers of the stratified rock are\r\ncovered with the deposits of later periods. Rivers that cut deep\r\nchannels reveal the earlier rocks as outcrops along their canyon walk.\r\nThe record of the age of fishes is, for the most part, still an unopened\r\nbook. The pages are sealed, waiting for the geologist with his hammer to\r\ndisclose the mysteries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKING COAL\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this country, and in this age, who can doubt that coal is king? It is\r\none of the few necessities of life. In various sections of the country,\r\nlayers of coal have been discovered--some near the surface, others deep\r\nunderground. These are the storehouses of fuel which the coal miners dig\r\nout and bring to the surface, and the railroads distribute. From\r\nPennsylvania and Ohio to Alabama stretches the richest coal-basin.\r\nIllinois and Indiana contain another. From Iowa southward to Texas\r\nanother broad basin lies. Central Michigan and Nova Scotia each has\r\nisolated coal-basins. All these have been discovered and mined, for they\r\nlie in the oldest part of the country.\r\n\r\nIn the West, coal-beds have been discovered in several states, but many\r\nregions have not yet been explored. Vast coal-fields, still untouched,\r\nhave been located in Alaska. The Government is trying to save this fuel\r\nsupply for coming generations. Many of the richest coal-beds from Nova\r\nScotia southward dip under the ocean. They have been robbed by the\r\nerosive action of waves and running water. Glaciers have ground away\r\ntheir substance, and given it to the sea. Much that remains intact must\r\nbe left by miners on account of the difficulties of getting out coal\r\nfrom tilted and contorted strata.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, the first-formed coal is the best. The Western coal-fields\r\nbelong to the period following the Carboniferous Age. Although\r\nconditions were favourable to abundant coal formation, Western coal is\r\nnot equal to the older, Eastern coal. It is often called _lignite_, a\r\nword that designates its immaturity compared with anthracite.\r\n\r\nCoal formed in the Triassic Period is found in a basin near Richmond,\r\nVirginia. There is an abundance of this coal, but it has been subjected\r\nto mountain-making pressure and heat, and is extremely inflammable. The\r\nminers are in constant danger on account of coal gas, which becomes\r\nexplosive when the air of the shaft reaches and mingles with it. This\r\nthe miner calls \"fire damp.\" North Carolina has coal of the same\r\nformation, that is also dangerous to mine, and very awkward to reach, on\r\naccount of the crumpling of the strata.\r\n\r\nThere are beds of coal so pure that very little ash remains after the\r\nburning. Five per cent, of ash may be reasonably expected in pure coal,\r\nunmixed with sedimentary deposits. Such coal was formed in that part of\r\nthe swamp which was not stirred by the inflow of a river. Wherever muddy\r\nwater flowed in among the fallen stems of plants, or sand drifted over\r\nthe accumulated peat, these deposits remained, to appear later and\r\nbother those who attempt to burn the coal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Eocene fish]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _By permission of the American Museum of Natural History_\r\n\r\nTrilobite from the Niagara limestone, Upper Silurian, of Western New\r\nYork]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sigillaria, Stigmaria and Lepidodendron]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _By permission of the American Museum of Natural History_\r\n\r\nCoal fern]\r\n\r\nYou know pure coal, that burns with great heat and leaves but little\r\nashes. You know also the other kind, that ignites with difficulty, burns\r\nwith little flame, gives out little heat, and dying leaves the furnace\r\nfull of ashes. You are trying to burn ancient mud that has but a small\r\nproportion of coal mixed with it. The miners know good coal from poor,\r\nand so do the coal dealers. It is not profitable to mine the impure part\r\nof the vein. It costs as much to mine and ship as the best quality, and\r\nit brings a much lower price.\r\n\r\nThe deeper beds of coal are better than those formed in comparatively\r\nrecent time and found lying nearer the surface. In many bogs a layer of\r\nembedded root fibres, called peat, is cut into bricks and dried for\r\nburning. Deeper than peat-beds lie the _lignites_, which are old beds of\r\npeat, on the way to become coal. _Soft coal_ is older than lignite. It\r\ncontains thirty to fifty per cent. of volatile matter, and burns\r\nreadily, with a bright blaze. The richest of this bituminous coal is\r\ncalled _fat_, or _fusing coal_. The bitumen oozes out, and the coal\r\ncakes in burning. Ordinary soft coal contains less, but still we can see\r\nthe resinous bitumen frying out of it as it burns. There is more heat\r\nand less volatile matter in _steam coal_, so-called because it is the\r\nfuel that most quickly forms steam in an engine. _Hard coal_ contains\r\nbut five to ten per cent. of volatile matter. It is slow to ignite and\r\nburns with a small blue blaze.\r\n\r\nFrom peat to anthracite coal I have named the series which increases\r\ngradually in the amount of heat it gives out, and increases and then\r\ndecreases in its readiness to burn and in the brightness of its flame.\r\nAnthracite coal has the highest amount of fixed carbon. This is the\r\nreason why it makes the best fuel, for fixed carbon is the substance\r\nwhich holds the store of imprisoned sunlight, liberated as heat when the\r\ncoal burns. Tremendous pressure and heat due to shrinking of the earth's\r\ncrust have crumpled and twisted the strata containing coal in eastern\r\nPennsylvania, and thus changed bituminous coal into anthracite. Ohio\r\nbeds, formed at the same time, but undisturbed by heat and pressure, are\r\nbituminous yet.\r\n\r\nThe coal-beds of Rhode Island are anthracite, but the coal is so hard\r\nthat it will not burn in an open fire. The terrible, mountain-making\r\nforces that crumpled these strata and robbed the coal of its volatile\r\nmatter, left so little of the gas-forming element, that a very special\r\ntreatment is necessary to make the carbon burn. It is used successfully\r\nin furnaces built for the smelting of ores.\r\n\r\nThe last stage in the coal series is a black substance which we know as\r\nblack lead, or graphite. We write with it when we use a \"lead\" pencil.\r\nThis is anthracite coal after all of the volatile matter has been driven\r\nout of it. It cannot burn, although it is solid carbon. The beds of\r\ngraphite have been formed out of coal by the same changes in the\r\nearth's crust which have converted soft coal into anthracite.\r\n\r\nThe tremendous pressure that bears on the coal measures has changed a\r\npart of the carbon into liquid and gaseous form. Lakes of oil have been\r\ntapped from which jets of great force have spouted out. Such\r\naccumulations of oil usually fill porous layers of sandstone and are\r\nconfined by overlying and underlying beds of impervious clay. Gas may be\r\nsimilarly confined until a well is drilled, relieving the pressure, and\r\nfurnishing abundant or scanty supply of this valuable fuel. Western\r\nPennsylvania coal-fields have beds of gas and oil. If mountain-making\r\nforces had broken the strata, as in eastern Pennsylvania, the gas and\r\nthe oil would have been lost by evaporation.\r\n\r\nThis is what happened in the anthracite coal-belt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW COAL WAS MADE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe broad, rounded dome of a maple tree shades my windows from the\r\nintense heat of this August day. The air is hot, and every leaf of the\r\ntree's thatched roof is spread to catch the sunlight. The carbon in the\r\nair is breathed in through openings on the under side of each leaf. The\r\nsap in the leaf pulp uses the carbon in making starch. The sun's heat is\r\nabsorbed. It is the energy that enables the leaf-green to produce a\r\nwonderful chemical change. Out of soil water, brought up from the roots,\r\nand the carbonic acid gas, taken in from the air, rich, sugary starch is\r\nmanufactured in the leaf laboratory.\r\n\r\nThis plant food returns in a slow current, feeding the growing cells\r\nunder the bark, from leaf tip to root tip, throughout the growing tree.\r\nThe sap builds solid wood. The maple tree has been built out of muddy\r\nwater and carbon gas. It stands a miracle before our eyes. In its tough\r\nwood fibres is locked up all the heat its leaves absorbed from the sun,\r\nsince the day the maple seed sprouted and the first pair of leaves\r\nlifted their palms above the ground.\r\n\r\nIf my maple tree should die, and fall, and lie undisturbed on the\r\nground, it would slowly decay. The carbon of its solid frame would pass\r\nback into the air, as gas, and the heat would escape so gradually that I\r\ncould not notice it at all, unless I thrust my hand into the warm,\r\ncrumbling mass.\r\n\r\nIf my tree should be cut down to-day and chopped into stove wood, it\r\nwould keep a fire in my grate for many months.\r\n\r\nBurning destroys wood substance a great deal faster than decay in the\r\nopen air does, but the processes of rotting and burning are alike in\r\nthis: each process releases the carbon, and gives it back to the air. It\r\ngives back also the sun's heat, stored while the tree was growing. There\r\nis left on the ground, and in the ashes on the hearth, only the mineral\r\nsubstance taken up in the water the roots gathered underground.\r\n\r\nIf my tree stood in swampy ground and fell over under a high wind, the\r\nwater that covered it and saturated its substance would prevent decay.\r\nThe carbon would not be allowed to escape as a gas to the air; the woody\r\nsubstance would become gradually changed into _peat_. In this form it\r\nmight remain for thousands of years, and finally be changed into coal.\r\n\r\nWhether it was burned while yet in the condition of peat, or millions of\r\nyears later, when it was transformed into coal, the heat stored in its\r\nsubstance was liberated by the burning. The carbon and the heat went\r\nback to the air.\r\n\r\nEvery green plant we see spreads its leaves to the sun. Every stick of\r\nwood we burn, and every lump of coal, is giving back, in the form of\r\nlight and heat, the energy that came from sunshine and was captured by\r\nthe green leaves. How long the wood has held this store of heat we may\r\neasily compute, for we can read the age of a tree. But the age of coal\r\nwe cannot accurately state. The years probably should be counted by\r\nmillions, instead of thousands.\r\n\r\nThe great inland sea that covered the middle portion of the continent\r\nduring the Silurian and the Devonian periods, became shallow by the\r\ndeposit of vast quantities of sediment. Along the lines of the deposits\r\nof greatest thickness, a crumpling of the earth's crust lifted the first\r\nfold of the Alleghany Mountains as a great sea wall on the east, and on\r\nthe western shore another formed the beginning of the Ozark Mountain\r\nsystem in Missouri. An island was lifted out of the sea, forming the\r\nelevated ground on which the city of Cincinnati now stands. Various\r\nother ridges and islands divided the ancient sea into much smaller\r\nbodies of water. Hemmed in by land these shallow sea-basins gradually\r\nchanged into fresh-water lakes, for they no longer had connection with\r\nthe ocean, and all the water they received came from rain. After\r\ncenturies of freshets, and of filling in with the rock débris brought by\r\nthe streams, they became great marshes, in which grew water-loving\r\nplants. Generation after generation of these plants died, and their\r\nremains, submerged by the water, were converted into peat. In the\r\ncourse of ages this peat became coal. This is the history of the coal\r\nmeasures.\r\n\r\nThere is no guesswork here. The stems of plants do not lose their\r\nmicroscopic structure in all the ages it has taken to transform them to\r\ncoal. A thin section of coal shows under a magnifier the structure of\r\nthe stems of the coal-forming plants. Moreover, the veins of coal\r\npreserve above or below them, in shales that were once deposits of mud,\r\nthe branching trunks of trees, perfectly fossilized. There are no better\r\nproofs of the vegetable origin of coal than the lumps themselves. But\r\nthey are plain to the naked eye, while the coal tells its story to the\r\nman with the microscope.\r\n\r\nThe fossil remains of the plants that flourished when coal was forming\r\nare gigantic, compared with plants of the same families now living. We\r\nmust conclude that the climate was tropical, the air very heavy with\r\nmoisture, and charged much more heavily than it is now with carbonic\r\nacid gas.\r\n\r\nThese conditions produced, in rapid succession, forests of tree ferns\r\nand horsetails and giant club mosses. These are the three types of\r\nplants out of which the coal was made. They were all rich in resin,\r\nwhich makes the coal burn readily. The ferns had stems as large as tree\r\ntrunks. Some have been found that are eighteen inches in diameter. We\r\nknow they are ferns, because the leaves are found with their fruits\r\nattached to them in the manner of present-day ferns. The stems show the\r\nwell known scar by which fern leaves are joined. And the wood of these\r\nfossil fern stems is tubular in structure, just as the wood of living\r\nferns is to-day.\r\n\r\nAmong the ferns which dominated these old marsh forests grew one kind,\r\nthe scaly leaves of which covered the stems and bore their fruits on the\r\nbranching tips. These giants, some of them with trunks four feet in\r\ndiameter, belong to the same group of plants as our creeping club\r\nmosses, but in the ancient days they stood up among the other ferns as\r\ntrees forty or fifty feet high.\r\n\r\nThe giant scouring rushes, or horsetails, had the same general\r\ncharacteristics as the little reed-like plants we know by those names\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\nThe highest plants of the coal period were leafy trees with nut-like\r\nfruits, that resemble the yew trees of the present. These gigantic trees\r\nwere the first conifers upon the earth. They foreshadowed the pines and\r\nthe other cone-bearing evergreens. Their leaves were broad and their\r\nfruits nut-like. The Japanese ginkgo, or maidenhair fern tree, is an\r\nold-fashioned conifer somewhat like those first examples of this family.\r\nTrunks sixty to seventy feet long, crowned with broad leaves and a spike\r\nof fruit, have been found lying in the upper layers of the coal-seams,\r\nand in sandstone strata that lie between the strata of coal. Peculiar\r\ncircular discs, which the microscope reveals along the sides of the wood\r\nfibres of these fossil trees, prove the wood structure to be like that\r\nof modern conifers.\r\n\r\nGeneration after generation of forests lived and died in the vast\r\nspreading swamps of this era. The land sank, and freshets came here and\r\nthere, drowning out all plant life, and covering the layers of peat with\r\nbeds of sand or mud. When the water went down, other forests took\r\npossession, and a new coal-bed was started. It is plainly seen that\r\nflooding often put an end to coal formation. Fifteen seams of coal, one\r\nabove another, is the greatest number that have been found. The veins\r\nvary from one inch to forty feet in thickness. These are separated by\r\nlayers of sandstone or shale, which accumulated as sediment, covering\r\nthe stumps of dead tree ferns and other growths, and preserving them as\r\nfossils to tell the story of those bygone ages as plainly as any other\r\nrecord could have done.\r\n\r\nFresh-water animals succeeded those of salt water in the swamps that\r\nformed the coal measures. Overhead, the first insects flitted among the\r\nbranches of the tree ferns. Dragon-flies darted above the surface and\r\ndipped in water as they do to-day. Spiders, scorpions, and cockroaches,\r\nall air-breathing insects, were represented, but none of the higher,\r\nnectar-loving insects, like flies and bees and butterflies, were there.\r\nFlowering plants had not yet appeared on the earth. Snakelike\r\namphibians, some fishlike, some lizard-like, and huge crocodilian forms\r\nappeared for the first time. These air-breathing swamp-dwellers could\r\nnot have lived in salt water.\r\n\r\nFresh-water molluscs and land shells appear for the first time as\r\nfossils in the rocks of the coal measures. On the shores of the ocean,\r\nthe rocks of this period show that trilobites, horseshoe crabs, and\r\nfishes still lived in vast numbers, and corals continued to form\r\nlimestone. The old types of marine animals changed gradually, but the\r\ncoal measures show strikingly different fossils. These rocks bear the\r\nfirst record of fresh-water and land animals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MOST USEFUL METAL\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is fortunate for us all that, out of the half-dozen so-called useful\r\nmetals, iron, which is the most useful of them all to the human race,\r\nshould be also the most plentiful and the cheapest. Aluminum is abundant\r\nin the common clay and soil under our feet. But separating it is still\r\nan expensive process; so that this metal is not commercially so\r\nplentiful as iron is, nor is it cheap.\r\n\r\nAll we know of the earth's substance is based on studies of the\r\nsuperficial part of its crust, a mere film compared with the eight\r\nthousand miles of its diameter. Nobody knows what the core of the\r\nearth--the great globe under this surface film--is made of; but we know\r\nthat it is of heavier material than the surface layer; and geologists\r\nbelieve that iron is an important element in the central mass of the\r\nglobe.\r\n\r\nOne thing that makes this guess seem reasonable is the great abundance\r\nof iron in the earth's crust. Another thing is that meteors which fall\r\non the earth out of the sky prove to be chiefly composed of iron. All of\r\ntheir other elements are ones which are found in our own rocks. If we\r\nbelieve that the earth itself is a fragment of the sun, thrown off in a\r\nheated condition and cooling as it flew through space, we may consider\r\nit a giant meteor, made of the substances we find in the chance meteor\r\nthat strikes the earth.\r\n\r\nIron is found, not only in the soil, but in all plant and animal bodies\r\nthat take their food from the soil. The red colour in fruits and\r\nflowers, and in the blood of the higher animals, is a form in which iron\r\nis familiar to us. It does more, perhaps, to make the world beautiful\r\nthan any other mineral element known.\r\n\r\nBut long before these benefits were understood, iron was the backbone of\r\ncivilization. It is so to-day. Iron, transformed by a simple process\r\ninto steel, sustains the commercial supremacy of the great civilized\r\nnations of the world. The railroad train, the steel-armoured battleship,\r\nthe great bridge, the towering sky-scraper, the keen-edged tool, the\r\ndelicate mechanism of watches and a thousand other scientific\r\ninstruments--all these things are possible to-day because iron was\r\ndiscovered and has been put to use.\r\n\r\nIt was probably one of the cave men, poking about in his fire among the\r\nrocks, who discovered a lump of molten metal which the heat had\r\nseparated from the rest of the rocks. He examined this \"clinker\" after\r\nit cooled, and it interested him. It was a new discovery. It may have\r\nbeen he, or possibly his descendants, who learned that this metal could\r\nbe pounded into other shapes, and freed by pounding from the pebbles\r\nand other impurities that clung to it when it cooled. The relics of\r\niron-tipped spears and arrows show the skill and ingenuity of our early\r\nancestors in making use of iron as a means of killing their prey. The\r\nearliest remains of this kind have probably been lost because the iron\r\nrusted away.\r\n\r\nMan was pretty well along on the road to civilization before he learned\r\nwhere iron could be found in beds, and how it could be purified for his\r\nuse. We now know that certain very minute plants, which live in quiet\r\nwater, cause iron brought into that water to be precipitated, and to\r\naccumulate in the bottom of these boggy pools. In ancient days these bog\r\ndeposits of iron often alternated with coal layers. Millions of years\r\nhave passed since these two useful substances were laid down. To-day the\r\ncoal is dug, along with the bog iron. The coal is burned to melt the\r\niron ore and prepare it for use. It is a fortunate region that produces\r\nboth coal and iron.\r\n\r\nBituminous coal is plentiful, and scattered all over the country, while\r\nanthracite is scarce. The cheapest iron is made in Alabama, which has\r\nits ore in rich deposits in hillsides, and coal measures close by,\r\nfurnishing the raw material for coke. The result is that the region of\r\nBirmingham has become the centre of great wealth through the development\r\nof iron and coal mines.\r\n\r\nWhere water flows over limestone rock, and percolates through layers of\r\nthis very common mineral, it causes the iron, gathered in these rock\r\nmasses, to be deposited in pockets. All along the Appalachian Mountains\r\nthe iron has been gathered in beds which are being mined. These beds of\r\nore are usually mixed with clay and other earthy substances from which\r\nthe metal can be separated only by melting. The ore is thrown into a\r\nfurnace where the metal melts and trickles down, leaving behind the\r\nnon-metallic impurities. It is drawn off and run into moulds, where it\r\ncools in the form of \"pig\" iron.\r\n\r\nThe first fuel used in the making of pig iron from the ore was charcoal.\r\nIn America the early settlers had no difficulty in finding plenty of\r\nwood. Indeed, the forests were weeds that had to be cut down and burned\r\nto make room for fields of grain. The finding of iron ore always started\r\na small industry in a colony. If there was a blacksmith, or any one else\r\namong the small company who understood working in iron, he was put in\r\ncharge.\r\n\r\nTo make the charcoal, wood was cut and piled closely in a dome-shaped\r\nheap, which was tightly covered with sods, except for a small opening\r\nnear the ground. In this a fire was built, and smothered, but kept going\r\nuntil all the wood within the oven was charred.\r\n\r\nThis fuel burned readily, with an intense heat, and without ashes.\r\nSticks of charcoal have the form of the wood, and they are stiff enough\r\nto hold up the ore of iron so that it cannot crush out the fire. For a\r\nlong time American iron was supplied by little smelters, scattered here\r\nand there. The workmen beat the melted metal on the forge, freeing it\r\nfrom impurities, and shaping the pure metal into useful articles.\r\nSometimes they made it into steel, by a process learned in the Old\r\nWorld.\r\n\r\nThe American iron industry, which now is one of the greatest in the\r\nworld, centres in Pittsburg, near which great deposits of iron and coal\r\nlie close together. The making of coke from coal has replaced the\r\nburning of charcoal for fuel. When the forests were cut away by\r\nlumbermen, the supply of charcoal threatened to give out, and\r\nexperiments were made in charring coal, which resulted in the successful\r\nmaking of coke, a fuel made from coal by a process similar to the making\r\nof charcoal from wood. The story of the making of coke out of hard and\r\nsoft coal is a long one, for it began as far back as the beginning of\r\nthe nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nIn 1812 the first boat-load of anthracite coal was sent to Philadelphia\r\nfrom a little settlement along the Lehigh River. A mine had been opened,\r\nthe owner of which believed that the black, shiny \"rocks\" would burn.\r\nHis neighbours laughed at him, for they had tried building fires with\r\nthem, and concluded that it could not be done. In Philadelphia, the\r\nowners of some coke furnaces gave the new fuel a trial, in spite of the\r\ndisgust of the stokers, who thought they were putting out their fires\r\nwith a pile of stones. After a little, however, the new fuel began to\r\nburn with the peculiar pale flame and intense heat that we know so\r\nwell, and the stokers were convinced that here was a new fuel, with\r\npossibilities in it.\r\n\r\nBut it was hard for people to be patient with the slow starting of this\r\nhard coal. Not until 1840 did it come into general favour, following the\r\ndiscovery that if hot air was supplied at the draught, instead of cold,\r\nanthracite coal became a perfect fuel.\r\n\r\nAt Connellsville, Pennsylvania, a vein of coal was discovered which made\r\ncoke of the very finest quality. Around this remarkable centre, coke\r\novens were built, and iron ore was shipped in, even from the rich beds\r\nof the Lake Superior country. But it was plain to see that Connellsville\r\ncoal would become exhausted; and so experiments in coke-making from\r\nother coals were still made. When soft coal burns, a waxy tar oozes out\r\nof it, which tends to smother the fire. Early experiments with coal in\r\nmelting iron ore indicated that soft coal was useless as a substitute\r\nfor charcoal and coke; but later experiments proved that coke of fine\r\nquality can be made out of this bituminous soft coal, by drawing off the\r\ntar which makes the trouble. New processes were invented by which\r\nvaluable gas and coal tar are taken out of bituminous coal, leaving, as\r\na residue, coke that is equal in quality to that made from the\r\nConnellsville coal. Fortunes have been made out of the separation of the\r\nelements of the once despised soft coal. For the coke and each of its\r\nby-products, coal tar and coal gas, are commercial necessities of life.\r\n\r\nThe impurities absorbed by the melting iron ore include carbon,\r\nphosphorus, and silicon. Carbon is the chief cause of the brittleness of\r\ncast iron. The puddling furnace was invented to remove this trouble. The\r\nmelted ore was stirred on a broad, basin-like hearth, with a\r\nlong-handled puddling rake. The flames swept over the surface, burning\r\nthe carbon liberated by the stirring. It was a hard, hot job for the man\r\nat the rake, but it produced forge iron, that could be shaped, hot or\r\ncold, on the anvil.\r\n\r\nThe next improvement was the process of pressing the hot iron between\r\ngrooved rollers to rid it of slag and other foreign matters collected in\r\nthe furnace. The old way was to hammer the metal free from such\r\nimpurities. This was slow and hard work.\r\n\r\nIron was an expensive and scarce metal until the hot blast-furnace\r\ncheapened the process of smelting the ore. The puddling furnace and the\r\ngrooved rollers did still more to bring it into general use. The\r\nrailroads developed with the iron industry. Soon they required a metal\r\nstronger than iron. Steel was far too expensive, though it was just what\r\nwas needed. Efforts were made to find a cheap way to change iron into\r\nsteel. Sir Henry Bessemer solved the problem by inventing the Bessemer\r\nconverter. It is a great closed retort, which is filled with melted pig\r\niron. A draught admits air, and the carbon is all burned out. Then a\r\ndefinite amount of carbon, just the amount required to change iron into\r\nsteel, is added, by throwing in bars of an alloy of carbon and\r\nmanganese. The latter gives steel its toughness, and enables it to\r\nresist greater heat without crystallizing and thus losing its temper.\r\n\r\nWhen the carbon has been put in, the retort is closed. The molten metal\r\nabsorbs the alloy, and the product is Bessemer steel. In fifteen minutes\r\npig iron can be transformed into ingot steel. The invention made\r\npossible the use of steel in the construction of bridges, high\r\nbuildings, and ships. It made this age of the world the Age of Steel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AGE OF REPTILES\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo big and interesting reptiles we see in the Zoo, the crocodile and\r\nits cousin, the alligator. In the everglades of Florida both are found.\r\nThe crocodile of the Nile is protected by popular superstition, so it is\r\nin better luck than ours. The alligators have been killed off for their\r\nskins, and it is only a matter of time till these lumbering creatures\r\nwill be found only in places where they are protected as the remnants of\r\na vanished race. Giant reptiles of other kinds are few upon the earth\r\nnow. The _boa constrictor_ is the giant among snakes. The great tropical\r\nturtles represent an allied group. Most of the turtles, lizards, and\r\nsnakes are small, and in no sense dominant over other creatures.\r\n\r\nThe rocks that lie among the coal measures contain fossils of huge\r\nanimals that lived in fresh water and on land, the ancestors of our\r\nfrogs, toads, and salamanders, a group we call amphibians. Some of these\r\nanimals had the form of snakes; some were fishlike, with scaly bodies;\r\nothers were lizard-like or like huge crocodiles. These were the\r\nancestors of the reptiles, which became the rulers of land and sea\r\nduring the Mesozoic Era. The rocks that overlie the coal measures\r\ncontain fossils of these gigantic animals.\r\n\r\nStrange crocodile-like reptiles, with turtle-like beaks and tusks, but\r\nno teeth, left their skeletons in the mud of the shores they frequented.\r\nAnd others had teeth in groups--grinders, tearers, and cutters--like\r\nmammals. These had other traits like the old-fashioned, egg-laying\r\nmammals, the duck-billed platypus, for example, that is still found in\r\nAustralia. Along with the remains of these creatures are found small\r\npouched mammals, of the kangaroo kind, in the rocks of Europe and\r\nAmerica. These land animals saw squatty cycads, and cone-bearing trees,\r\nthe ancestors of our evergreens, growing in forests, and marshes covered\r\nwith luxuriant growths of tree ferns and horsetails, the fallen bodies\r\nof which formed the recent coal that is now dug in Virginia and North\r\nCarolina. Ammonites, giant sea snails, with chambered shells that\r\nreached a yard and more in diameter, and gigantic squids, swam the seas.\r\nSea urchins, starfish, and oysters were abundant. Insects flitted\r\nthrough the air, but no birds appeared among the trees or beasts in the\r\njungles. Over all forms of living creatures reptiles ruled. They were\r\nremarkable in size and numbers. There were swimming, running, and flying\r\nforms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Banded sandstone from Calico Cañon, South Dakota]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _By permission of the American Museum of Natural History_\r\n\r\nOpalized wood from Utah]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _By permission of the American Museum of Natural History_\r\n\r\nRestoration of a carnivorous Dinosaur, Allosaurus, from the Upper\r\nJurassic and Lower Cretaceous of Wyoming. When erect the animal was\r\nabout 15 feet high]\r\n\r\nThe fish-reptile, _Ichthyosaurus_, was a hump-backed creature, thirty to\r\nforty feet long, with short neck, very large head, and long jaw, set\r\nwith hundreds of pointed teeth. Its eye sockets were a foot across. The\r\nfour short limbs were strong paddles, used for swimming. The long,\r\nslender tail ended in a flat fin. Perfect skeletons of this creature\r\nhave been found. Its rival in the sea was the lizard-like\r\n_Plesiosaurus_, the small head of which was mounted on a long neck. The\r\ntail was short, but the paddles were long and powerful. No doubt this\r\nagile creature held its own, though somewhat smaller than the more\r\nmassively built Ichthyosaurus.\r\n\r\nThe land reptiles called _Dinosaurs_ were the largest creatures that\r\nhave ever walked the earth. In the American Museum of Natural History,\r\nin New York, the mounted skeleton of the giant Dinosaur fairly takes\r\none's breath away. It is sixty-six feet long, and correspondingly large\r\nin every part, except its head. This massive creature was remarkably\r\nshort of brains.\r\n\r\nThe strangest thing about the land reptiles is the fact that certain of\r\nthem walked on their hind legs, like birds, and made three-toed tracks\r\nin the mud. Indeed, these fossil tracks, found in slate, were called\r\nbird tracks, until the bones of the reptile skeleton with the bird-like\r\nfoot were discovered. Certain long grooves in the slate, hitherto\r\nunexplained, were made by the long tail that dragged in the mud.\r\n\r\nWhen the mud dried, and was later covered with sediment of another kind,\r\nthese prints were preserved, and when the bed of rock was discovered by\r\nquarrymen, the two kinds split apart, showing the record of the stroll\r\nof a giant along the river bank in bygone days.\r\n\r\nThe flying reptiles were still more bird-like in structure, though\r\ngigantic in size. Imagine the appearance of a great lizard with\r\nbat-like, webbed wings and bat-like, toothed jaws! The first feathered\r\nfossil bird was discovered in the limestone rock of Bavaria. It was a\r\nwonderfully preserved fossil, showing the feathers perfectly. Three\r\nfingers of each \"hand\" were free and clawed, so that the creature could\r\nseize its prey, and yet use its feathered wings in flight. The small\r\nhead had jaws set with socketed teeth, like a reptile's, and the long,\r\nlizard tail of twenty-one bones had a pair of side feathers at each\r\njoint. This _Archeopteryx_ is the reptilian ancestor of birds. During\r\nthis age of the world, one branch of the reptile group established the\r\nfamily line of birds. The bird-like reptiles are the connecting link\r\nbetween the two races. How much both birds and reptiles have changed\r\nfrom that ancient type, their common ancestor!\r\n\r\nI have mentioned but a few of the types of animals that make the\r\nreptilian age the wonder of all time. One after another skeletons are\r\nunearthed and new species are found. The Connecticut River Valley, with\r\nits red sandstones and shales of the Mesozoic Era, is famous among\r\ngeologists, because it preserves the tracks of reptiles, insects, and\r\ncrustaceans. These signs tell much of the life that existed when these\r\nflakes of stone were sandy and muddy stretches Not many bones have been\r\nfound, however. The thickness of these rocks is between one and two\r\nmiles. The time required to accumulate so much sediment must have been\r\nvery great.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _By permission of the American Museum of Natural History_\r\n\r\nModel of a three-horned Dinosaur, _Triceratops_, from Cretaceous of\r\nMontana. Animal in life about 25 feet long]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _By permission of the American Museum of Natural History_\r\n\r\nMounting the forelegs of _Brontosaurus_, the aquatic Dinosaur]\r\n\r\nIt is not clear just what caused the race of giant reptiles to decline\r\nand pass away. The climate did not materially change. Perhaps races grow\r\nold, and ripe for death, after living long on the earth. It seems as if\r\ntheir time was up; and the clumsy giants abdicated their reign, leaving\r\ndominion over the sea, the air, and the land to those animals adapted to\r\ntake the places they were obliged to vacate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AGE OF MAMMALS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe warm-blooded birds and mammals followed the reptiles. This does not\r\nmean that all reptiles died, after having ruled the earth for thousands\r\nof years. It means that changes in climate and other life conditions\r\nwere unfavourable to the giants of the cold-blooded races, and gradually\r\nthey passed away. They are represented now on the earth by lesser\r\nreptiles, which live comfortably with the wild creatures of other\r\ntribes, but which in no sense rule in the brute creation. They live\r\nrather a lurking, cautious life, and have to hide from enemies, except a\r\nfew more able kinds, provided with means of defense.\r\n\r\nThere were mammals on the earth in the days of reptilian supremacy, but\r\nthey were small in size and numbers, and had to avoid any open conflict\r\nwith the giant reptiles, or be worsted in a fight. Now the time came\r\nwhen the ruling power changed hands. The mammals had their turn at\r\nruling the lower animals. It was the beginning of things as they are\r\nto-day, for mammals still rule. But many millions of years have probably\r\nstood between the age when this group of animals first began to swarm\r\nover the earth, and the time when Man came to be ruler over all created\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nAmong the reptiles of the period when the sea, the land, and the air\r\nwere swarming with these great creatures were certain kinds that had\r\ntraits of mammals. Others were bird-like. From these reptilian ancestors\r\nbirds and mammals have sprung. No one doubts this. The fossils prove it,\r\nstep by step.\r\n\r\nYet the rocks surprise the geologist with the suddenness with which many\r\nnew kinds of mammals appeared on the earth. Possibly the rocks\r\ncontaining the bones of so many kinds were fortunately located. The\r\nspots may have been morasses where migrating mammals were overwhelmed\r\nwhile passing. Possibly conditions favored the rapid development of new\r\nkinds, and the multiplication of their numbers. Warm, moist climate\r\nfurnished abundant succulent plant food for the herbivors, and these in\r\nturn furnished prey for the carnivors.\r\n\r\nThe coal formed during the Tertiary Period gives added proof that the\r\nplant life was luxuriant. The kinds of trees that grew far north of our\r\npresent warm zones have left in the rocks evidence in the form of\r\nperfect leaves and cones and other fruits. For instance, magnolias grew\r\nin Greenland, and palm trees in Dakota. The temperature of Greenland was\r\nthirty degrees warmer than it is now. Our Northern States lie in a belt\r\nthat must have had a climate much like that of Florida now. Europe was\r\ncorrespondingly mild.\r\n\r\nA special chapter tells of the gradual development of the horse. One\r\nhundred different kinds of mammals have been found in the Eocene rocks,\r\nmany of which have representative species at the same time in Europe and\r\nAmerica. The rocks of Asia probably have similar records.\r\n\r\nThe Eocene rocks, lowest of the Tertiary strata, contain remains of\r\nanimals the families of which are now extinct. Next overlying the\r\nEocene, the Miocene rocks have fossils of animals belonging to modern\r\nfamilies--rhinoceroses, camels, deer, dogs, cats, horses--but the genera\r\nof which are now extinct. The Pliocene strata (above the Miocene)\r\ncontains fossils of animals so closely related to the wild animals now\r\non the earth as to belong to the same genera. They differ from modern\r\nkinds only in the species, as the red squirrel is a different species\r\nfrom the gray.\r\n\r\nSo the record in the rocks shows a gradual approach of the mammals to\r\nthe kinds we know, a gradual passing of the mighty forms that ruled by\r\nsize and strength, and the coming of forms with greater intelligence,\r\nadapted to the change to a colder climate.\r\n\r\nIt sometimes happens that a farmer, digging a well on the prairie,\r\nstrikes the skeleton of a monster mammal, called the _mastodon_. This\r\nvery thing happened on a neighbour's farm when I was a girl, in Iowa.\r\nEverybody was excited. The owner of the land dug out every bone, careful\r\nthat the whole skeleton be found. As he expected, the director of a\r\nmuseum was glad to pay a high price for the bones.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _By permission of the American Museum of Natural History_\r\n\r\nRestoration of an aquatic Dinosaur, _Brontosaurus excelsus_, from the\r\nUpper Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous of Wyoming.

The\r\ncreature moved in herds like the buffalo from swamp to swamp; and old\r\nage coming on, the individual, unable to keep up with the herd, sank to\r\nhis death in the boggy ground. The peat accumulated over his bones,\r\nundisturbed until thousands of years elapse, and the chance digging of a\r\nwell discovers his skeleton.\r\n\r\nFrozen in the ice of northern Siberia, near the mouths of rivers, a\r\nnumber of mammoths have been found. These are creatures of the elephant\r\nfamily, and belonging to the extinct race that lived in the Quaternary\r\nPeriod, just succeeding the Tertiary. The ice overtook the specimens,\r\nand they have been in cold storage ever since. For this reason, both\r\nflesh and bones are preserved, a rare thing to happen, and rarer still\r\nto be seen by a scientist.\r\n\r\nThe ignorant natives made a business of watching the ice masses at the\r\nriver mouth for dark spots that showed where a mammoth was encased in\r\nthe ice. If an iceberg broke off near such a place, the sun might thaw\r\nthe ice front of the glacier, until the hairy monster could at length be\r\nreached. His long hair served for many uses, and the wool that grew\r\nunder the hair was used as a protection from the Arctic winter. The\r\nfrozen flesh was eaten; the bones carved into useful tools; but the\r\nchief value of the find was in the great tusks of ivory, that curved\r\nforward and pointed over the huge shoulders. It was worth a fortune to\r\nget a pair and sell them to a buyer from St. Petersburg.\r\n\r\nOne of the finest museum specimens of the mammoth was secured by buying\r\nthe tusks of the dealer, and by his aid tracing the location of the\r\ncarcass, which was found still intact, except that dogs had eaten away\r\npart of one foreleg, bone and all. From this carefully preserved\r\nspecimen, models have been made, exactly copying the shape and the size\r\nof the animal, its skin, hair, and other details.\r\n\r\nThe sabre-toothed tiger, the sharp tusks of which, six to eight inches\r\nlong, made it a far more ferocious beast than any modern tiger of\r\ntropical jungles, was a Quaternary inhabitant of Europe and America. So\r\nwas a smaller tiger, and a lion. The Irish elk, which stood eleven feet\r\nhigh, with antlers that spread ten feet apart at the tips, was monarch\r\nin the deer family, which had several different species on both\r\ncontinents. Wild horses and wild cattle, one or two of great size,\r\nroamed the woods, while rhinos and the hippopotamus kept near the\r\nwater-courses. Hyenas skulked in the shadows, and acted as scavengers\r\nwhere the great beasts of prey had feasted. Sloths and cuirassed\r\nanimals, like giant armadillos, lived in America. Among bears was one,\r\nthe cave bear, larger than the grizzly. True monkeys climbed the trees.\r\nFlamingo, parrots, and tall secretary birds followed the giant\r\n_gastornis_, the ancestor of wading birds and ostriches, which stood ten\r\nfeet high, but had wings as small and useless as the auk of later times.\r\n\r\nWith the entrance of the modern types of trees, came other flowering\r\nplants, and with them the insects that live on the nectar of flowers.\r\nThrough a long line of primitive forms, now extinct, flowering plants\r\nand their insect friends conform to modern types. The record is written\r\nin the great stone book.\r\n\r\nThe Age of Mammals in America and Europe ended with the gradual rise of\r\nthe continental areas, and a fall of temperature that ushered in the Ice\r\nAge. With the death of tropical vegetation, the giant mammals passed\r\naway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HORSE AND HIS ANCESTORS\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery city has a horse market, where you may look over hundreds of\r\nanimals and select one of any colour, size, or kind. The least in size\r\nand weight is the Shetland pony, which one man buys for his children to\r\ndrive or ride. Another man wants a long-legged, deep-chested hunter.\r\nAnother wants heavy draught-horses, with legs like great pillars under\r\nthem, and thick, muscular necks--horses weighing nearly a ton apiece and\r\nable to draw the heaviest trucks. What a contrast between these slow but\r\npowerful animals and the graceful, prancing racer with legs like\r\npipe-stems--fleet and agile, but not strong enough to draw a heavy load!\r\n\r\nAll these different breeds of horses have been developed since man\r\nsucceeded in capturing the wild horse and making it help him. Man\r\nhimself was still a savage, and he had to fight with wild beasts, as if\r\nhe were one of them, until he discovered that he could conquer them by\r\nsome power higher than physical strength. From this point on, human\r\nintelligence has been the power that rules the lower animals. Its\r\ngradual development is the story of the advance of civilization on the\r\nearth. Through unknown thousands of years it has gone on, and it is not\r\nyet finished.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _By permission of the American Museum of Natural History_\r\n\r\nRestoration of a Siberian mammoth, _Elephas primogenius_, pursued by men\r\nof the old stone age of Europe. Late Pleistocene epoch]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _By permission of the American Museum of Natural History_\r\n\r\nRestoration of a small four-toed ancestor of the horse family, _Eohippus\r\nventicolus_. Lower Eocene of Wyoming]\r\n\r\nJust when and where and how our savage ancestors succeeded in taming the\r\nwild horse of the plains and the forests of Europe or Asia is unknown.\r\nMan first made friends with the wild sheep, which were probably more\r\ndocile than wild oxen and horses. We can imagine cold and hungry men\r\nseeking shelter from storms in rocky hollows, where sheep were huddled.\r\nHow warm the woolly coats of these animals felt to their human\r\nfellow-creatures crowded in with them in the dark!\r\n\r\nIt is believed that the primitive men who used stone axes as implements\r\nand weapons, learned to use horses to aid them in their hunting, and in\r\ntheir warfare with beasts and other men. Gradually these useful animals\r\nwere adapted to different uses; and at length different breeds were\r\nevolved. Climate and food supply had much to do with the size and the\r\ncharacter of the breeds. In the Shetland Islands the animals are\r\nnaturally dwarfed by the cold, bleak winters, and the scant vegetation\r\non which they subsist. In middle Europe, where the summers are long and\r\nthe winters mild, vegetation is luxurious, and the early horses\r\ndeveloped large frames and heavy muscles. The Shetland pony and the\r\nPercheron draught-horse are the two extremes of size.\r\n\r\nWhat man has done in changing the types of horses is to emphasize\r\nnatural differences. The offspring of the early heavy horses became\r\nheavier than their parents. The present draught-horse was produced,\r\nafter many generations, all of which gradually approached the type\r\ndesired. The slender racehorses, bred for speed and endurance rather\r\nthan strength, are the offspring of generations of parents that had\r\nthese qualities strongly marked. Hence came the English thoroughbred and\r\nthe American trotter.\r\n\r\nWe can read in books the history of breeds of horses. Our knowledge of\r\nwhat horses were like in prehistoric times is scant. It is written in\r\nlayers of rock that are not very deep, but are uncovered only here and\r\nthere, and only now and then seen by eyes that can read the story told\r\nby fossil skeletons of horses of the ages long past.\r\n\r\nGeologists have unearthed from time to time skeletons of horses. It was\r\nProfessor Marsh who spent so much time in studying the wonderful beds of\r\nfossil mammals in the western part of this country, and found among them\r\nthe skeletons of many species of horses that lived here with camels and\r\nelephants and rhinoceroses and tigers, long before the time of man's\r\ncoming.\r\n\r\nHow can any one know that these bones belonged to a horse's skeleton?\r\nBecause some of them are like the bones of a modern horse. It is an easy\r\nmatter for a student of animal anatomy to distinguish a horse from a cow\r\nby its bones. The teeth and the foot are enough. These are important and\r\ndistinguishing characters. It is by peculiarities in the formation of\r\nthe bones of the foot that the different species of extinct horses are\r\nrecognized by geologists.\r\n\r\nWild horses still exist in the wilds of Russia. Remains of the same\r\nspecies have been dug out of the soil and found in caves in rocky\r\nregions. Deeper in the earth are found the bones of horses differing\r\nfrom those now living. The bones of the foot indicate a different kind\r\nof horse--an unknown species. But in the main features, the skeleton is\r\ndistinctly horse-like.\r\n\r\nIn rocks of deeper strata the fossil bones of other horses are found.\r\nThey differ somewhat from those found in rocks nearer the surface of the\r\nearth, and still more from those of the modern horse. The older the\r\nrocks, the more the fossil horse differs from the modern. Could you\r\nthink of a more interesting adventure than to find the oldest rocks that\r\nshow the skeletons of horses?\r\n\r\nThe foot of a horse is a long one, though we think of it as merely the\r\npart he walks on. A horse walks on the end of his one toe. The nail of\r\nthe toe we call the \"hoof.\" The true heel is the hock, a sharp joint\r\nlike an elbow nearly half way up the leg. Along each side of the cannon,\r\nthe long bone of this foot, lies a splint of bone, which is the remnant\r\nof a toe, that is gradually being obliterated from the skeleton. These\r\ntwo splints in the modern horse's foot tell the last chapter of an\r\ninteresting story. The earliest American horse, the existence of which\r\nis proved by fossil bones, tells the first chapter. The story has been\r\nread backward by geologists. It is told by a series of skeletons, found\r\nin successive strata of rock.\r\n\r\nThe \"Bad Lands\" of the arid Western States are rich in fossil remains of\r\nhorses. Below the surface soil lie the rocks of the Quaternary Period,\r\nwhich included the drift laid down by the receding glaciers and the\r\nfloods that followed the melting of the ice-sheet. Under the Quaternary\r\nlie the Tertiary rocks. These comprise three series, called the Eocene,\r\nMiocene, and Pliocene, the Eocene being the oldest. In the middle region\r\nof North America, ponds and marshy tracts were filled in during the\r\nTertiary Period, by sediment from rivers; and in these beds of clay and\r\nother rock débris the remains of fresh-water and land animals are\r\npreserved. Raised out of water, and exposed to erosive action of wind\r\nand water, these deposits are easily worn away, for they have not the\r\nsolidity of older rocks. They are the crumbly Bad Lands of the West, cut\r\nthrough by rivers, and strangely sculptured by wind and rain. Here the\r\nfossil horses have been found.\r\n\r\n_Eohippus_, the dawn horse, is the name given a skeleton found in 1880\r\nin the lower Eocene strata in Wyoming. This specimen lay buried in a\r\nrock formation ages older than that in which the oldest known skeleton\r\nof this family had been found. Its discovery made a great sensation\r\namong scientists. This little animal, the skeleton of which is no larger\r\nthan that of a fox, had four perfect toes, and a fifth splint on the\r\nforefoot, and three toes on the hind foot. The teeth are herbivorous.\r\n\r\n_Orohippus_, with a larger skeleton, was found in the middle Eocene\r\nstrata of Wyoming. Its feet are like those of its predecessor, except\r\nthat the splint is gone. The teeth as well as the feet are more like\r\nthose of the modern horse.\r\n\r\n_Mesohippus_, the three-toed horse, found in the Miocene, shows the\r\nfourth toe reduced to splints, and the skeleton as big as that of a\r\nsheep. In this the horse family becomes fairly established.\r\n\r\n_Hypohippus_, the three-toed forest horse, found in the middle Miocene\r\nstrata of Colorado, is a related species, but not a direct ancestor of\r\nthe modern horse.\r\n\r\n_Neohipparion_, the three-toed desert horse, from the upper Miocene\r\nstrata, shows the three toes still present. But the Pliocene rocks\r\ncontain fossils showing gradual reduction of the two side toes,\r\nmodification of the teeth, and increase in size of the skeleton.\r\n\r\n_Protohippus_ and _Pliohippus_, the one-toed species from the Pliocene\r\nstrata, illustrate these changes. They were about the size of small\r\nponies.\r\n\r\n_Equus_, the modern horse, was represented in the Pliocene strata by a\r\nspecies, now extinct, called _Equus Scotti_. This we may regard as the\r\ntrue wild horse of America, for it was as large as the domesticated\r\nhorse, and much like it, though more like a zebra in some respects. No\r\none can tell why these animals, once abundant in this country, became\r\nextinct at the end of the Tertiary Period. But this is undoubtedly true.\r\n\r\nThe types described form a series showing how the ancestors of the\r\nmodern horse, grazing on the marshy borders of ancient ponds, lived and\r\ndied, generation after generation, through a period covering thousands,\r\npossibly millions, of years. Along the sides of the crumbling buttes\r\nthese ancient burying-grounds are being uncovered. Within a dozen years\r\nseveral expeditions, fitted out by the American Museum of Natural\r\nHistory, have searched the out-cropping strata in Dakota and Wyoming for\r\nbones of mammals known to have lived at the time the strata were forming\r\nin the muddy shallows along the margins of lake and marsh. Duplicate\r\nskeletons of the primitive horse types above have been found, and vast\r\nnumbers of their scattered bones. Each summer geological excursions will\r\nadd to the wealth of fossils of this family collected in museums.\r\n\r\nThe Tertiary rocks in Europe yield the same kind of secrets. The region\r\nof Paris overlies the estuary of an ancient river. When the strata are\r\nlaid bare by the digging of foundations for buildings, bones are found\r\nin abundance. Cuvier was a famous French geologist who made extensive\r\nstudies of the remains of the prehistoric animals found in this old\r\nburial-place called by scientists the Paris basin. He believed that the\r\ndead bodies floated down-stream and accumulated in the mud of the\r\ndelta, where the tide checked the river's current.\r\n\r\nSkeletons of the Hipparion, a graceful, three-toed horse, were found in\r\nnumbers in the strata of the Miocene time. This animal lived in Europe\r\nwhile the Pliohippus and the Protohippus were flourishing in America.\r\n\r\nA great number of species of tapir-like animals left their bones in the\r\nParis basin, among them a three-hoofed animal which may have been the\r\nconnecting link between the horse and the tapir families. Cuvier found\r\nthe connecting link between tapirs and cud-chewing mammals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AGE OF MAN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe hairy, woolly mammoth was one of the giant mammals that withstood\r\nthe cold of the great ice flood, when the less hardy kinds were cut off\r\nby the changing climate of the northern half of Europe and America. In\r\ncaves where the wild animals took refuge from their enemies, skeletons\r\nof men have been found with those of the beasts. With these chance\r\nskeletons have been found rude, chipped stone spear-heads, hammers, and\r\nother tools. With these the savage ancestors of our race defended\r\nthemselves, and preyed on such animals as they could use for food. They\r\nhunted the clumsy mammoth successfully, and shared the caverns in the\r\nrocks with animals like the hyena, the sabre-toothed tiger, and the cave\r\nbear, which made these places their homes. In California a human skull\r\nwas found in the bed of an ancient river, which was buried by a lava\r\nflow from craters long ago extinct. With this buried skull a few\r\nwell-shaped but rough stone tools were found. This man must have lived\r\nwhen the great ice flood was at its height.\r\n\r\nIn southern France, caves have been opened that contained bones and\r\nimplements of men who evidently lived by fishing and hunting. Bone\r\nfish-hooks showed skill in carving with the sharp edges of flint\r\nflakes. A spirited drawing of a mammoth, made on a flat, stone surface,\r\nis a proof that savage instincts were less prominent in these cave men\r\nthan in those who fought the great reindeer and the mammoth farther\r\nnorth.\r\n\r\nIn later times men of higher intelligence formed tribes, tamed the wild\r\nhorse, the ox, and the sheep, and made friends with the dog. Great heaps\r\nof shells along the shores show where the tribes assembled at certain\r\ntimes to feast on oysters and clams. Bones of animals used as food, and\r\ntools, are found in these heaps, called \"kitchen-middens.\" These are\r\nespecially numerous in Northern Europe. The stone implements used by\r\nthese tribes were smoothly polished. A higher intelligence expressed\r\nitself also by the making of utensils out of clay. This pottery has been\r\nfound in shell heaps. So the rude cave man, who was scarcely less a wild\r\nbeast than the animals which competed with him for a living and a\r\nshelter from storms and cold, was succeeded by a higher man who brought\r\nthe brutes into subjection by force of will and not by physical\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\nThe lake-dwellers, men of the Bronze Age, built houses on piles in the\r\nlakes of Central Europe. About sixty years ago the water was low, and\r\nthese relics of a vanished race were first discovered. The lake bottoms\r\nwere scraped for further evidences of their life. Tools of polished\r\nstone and of bronze were taken up in considerable numbers. Stored\r\ngrains and dried fruits of several kinds were found. Ornamental\r\ntrinkets, weapons of hunters and warriors, and agricultural tools tell\r\nhow the people lived. Their houses were probably built over the water as\r\na means of safety from attack of beasts or hostile men.\r\n\r\nIn our country the mound-builders have left the story of their manners\r\nof life in the spacious, many-roomed tribal houses, built underground,\r\nand left with a great variety of relics to the explorers of modern\r\ntimes. These people worked the copper mines, and hammered and polished\r\nlumps of pure metal into implements for many uses. With these are tools\r\nof polished stone. Stores of corn were found in many mounds scattered in\r\nthe Mississippi Valley.\r\n\r\nThe cliff-dwellers of the mesas of Arizona and New Mexico had habits\r\nlike those of the mound-builders, and the Aztecs, a vanished race in the\r\nSouthwest, at whose wealth and high civilization the invading Spaniards\r\nunder Cortez marvelled. The plastered stone houses of the cliff-dwelling\r\nIndians had many stories and rooms, each built to house a tribe, not\r\nmerely a family.\r\n\r\nThe Pueblo, the Moqui, and the Zuni Indians build similar dwellings\r\nto-day, isolated on the tops of almost inaccessible mesas.\r\n\r\nMillions of years have passed since life appeared on the earth.\r\nGradually higher forms have followed lower ones in the sea and on the\r\nland. But not all of the lower forms have gone. All grades of plants\r\nand animals still flourish, but the dominant class in each age is more\r\nhighly organized than the class that ruled the preceding age.\r\n\r\nTo discover the earth's treasure, and to turn it to use; to tame wild\r\nanimals and wild plants, and make them serve him; to create ever more\r\nbeautiful and more useful forms in domestication; to find out the\r\nearth's life story, by reading the pages of the great stone book--these\r\nare undertakings that waited for man's coming.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II\r\n\r\nTHE SKY\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEVERY FAMILY A \"STAR CLUB\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe best family hobby we have ever had is the stars. We have a star club\r\nwith no dues to pay, no officers to boss us, and only three rules:\r\n\r\n1. We shall have nothing but \"fun\" in this club--no hard work. Therefore\r\nno mathematics for us!\r\n\r\n2. We can't afford a telescope. Therefore we must be satisfied with what\r\nbright eyes can see.\r\n\r\n3. No second-hand wonders for us! We want to see the things ourselves,\r\ninstead of depending on books.\r\n\r\nYou can't imagine what pleasure we have had in one short year! The baby,\r\nof course, was too young to learn anything, and besides he was in bed\r\nlong before the stars came out. But Ruth, our seven-year-old, knows ten\r\nof the fifteen brightest stars; and she can pick out twelve of the most\r\nbeautiful groups or constellations. We grown-ups know all of the\r\nbrightest stars, and all forty-eight of the most famous constellations.\r\nAnd the whole time we have given to it would not exceed ten minutes a\r\nday!\r\n\r\nAnd the best part is the _way_ we know the stars. The sky is no longer\r\nbewildering to us. The stars are not cold, strange, mysterious. They are\r\nfriends. We know their faces just as easily as you know your playmates.\r\nFor instance, we know Sirius, because he is the brightest. We know\r\nCastor and Pollux, because they are twins. We know Regulus, because he\r\nis in the handle of the Sickle. And some we know by their colours. They\r\nare just as different as President Taft, \"Ty\" Cobb, Horace Fletcher and\r\nMaude Adams. And quite as interesting!\r\n\r\nWhat's more, none of us can ever get lost again. No matter what strange\r\nwoods or city we go to, we never get \"turned around.\" Or if we do, we\r\nquickly find the right way by means of the sun or the stars.\r\n\r\nThen, too, our star club gives us all a little exercise when we need it\r\nmost. Winter is the time when we all work hardest and have the fewest\r\noutdoor games. Winter is also the best time for young children to enjoy\r\nthe stars, because it gets dark earlier in winter--by five o'clock, or\r\nlong before children go to bed. It is pleasant to go out doors for half\r\nan hour before supper and learn one new star or constellation.\r\n\r\nAgain, it is always entertaining because every night you find the old\r\nfriends in new places. No two nights are just the same. The changes of\r\nthe moon make a great difference. Some nights you enjoy the moonlight;\r\nother nights you wish there were no moon, because it keeps you from\r\nspying out some new star. We have a little magazine that tells us all\r\nthe news of the stars and the planets and the comets _before_ the things\r\nhappen! We pay a dollar a year for it. It is called the _Monthly\r\nEvening Sky Map_.\r\n\r\nWhen we first became enthusiastic about stars, the father of our family\r\nsaid: \"Well, I think our Star Club will last about two years. I judge it\r\nwill cost us about two dollars and we shall get about twenty dollars\r\nworth of fun out of it.\" But in all three respects father was mistaken.\r\n\r\nPart of the two dollars father spoke of went for a book called \"The\r\nFriendly Stars,\" and seventy-five cents we spent for the most\r\nentertaining thing our family ever bought--a planisphere. This is a\r\ndevice which enables us to tell just where any star is, at any time, day\r\nor night, the whole year. It has a disc which revolves. All we have to\r\ndo is to move it until the month and the day come right opposite the\r\nvery hour we are looking at it, and then we can tell in a moment which\r\nstars can be seen at that time. Then we go down the street where there\r\nis a good electric light at the corner and we hold our planisphere up,\r\nalmost straight overhead. The light shines through, so that we can read\r\nit, and it is just as if we had a map of the heavens. We can pick out\r\nall the interesting constellations and name them just as easily as we\r\ncould find the Great Lakes or Rocky Mountains in our geography.\r\n\r\nWe became so eager not to miss any good thing that father got another\r\nbook. Every birthday in our family brought a new star book, until now we\r\nhave about a dozen--all of them interesting and not one of them having\r\nmathematics that children cannot understand. So I think we have spent on\r\nstars fifteen dollars more than we needed to spend (but I'm glad we did\r\nit), and I think we have had about two hundred dollars worth of fun!\r\nYes, when I think what young people spend on ball games, fishing,\r\ntennis, skating, and all the other things that children love, I am sure\r\nour family has had about two hundred dollars worth of fun out of stars.\r\nAnd there is more to come!\r\n\r\nYou would laugh to know why I enjoy stars so much. I have always studied\r\nbirds and flowers and trees and rocks and shells so much that I was\r\nafraid to get interested in stars. I thought it wouldn't rest me. But\r\nit's a totally different kind of science from any I ever studied! There\r\nare no families, genera, and species among the stars, thank Heaven!\r\nThat's one reason they refresh me. Another is that no one can press them\r\nand put them in a herbarium, or shoot them and put them in a museum. And\r\nanother thing about them that brings balm to my spirit is that no human\r\nbeing can destroy their beauty. No one can \"sub-divide\" Capella and fill\r\nit with tenements. No one can use Vega for a bill-board. Ah, well! we\r\nmust not be disturbed if every member of our family has a different\r\npoint of view toward the stars; we can all enjoy and love them in our\r\nown ways.\r\n\r\nHow would you like to start a Star Club like ours? You ought to be able\r\nto persuade your family to form one, because it need not cost a cent.\r\nPerhaps this book will interest them all, but the better way is for you\r\nto read about one constellation and then go out with some of the family\r\nand find it. This book does not tell about wonderful things you can\r\nnever see; it tells about the wonderful things all of us can see.\r\n\r\nI wish you success with your Star Club. Perhaps your uncles and aunts\r\nwill start clubs, too. We have three Star Clubs in our family--one in\r\nNew York, one in Michigan, and one in Colorado. Last winter the\r\n\"Colorado Star Gazers\" sent this challenge to the \"New Jersey\r\nNight-Owls:\" \"_We bet you can't see Venus by daylight!_\"\r\n\r\nThat seemed possible, because during that week the \"evening star\" was by\r\nfar the brightest object in the sky. But father and daughter searched\r\nthe sky before sunset in vain, and finally we had to ask the \"Moonstruck\r\nMichiganders\" how to see Venus while the sun was shining. Back came\r\nthese directions on a postal-card: \"Wait until it is dark and any one\r\ncan see Venus. Then find some tree, or other object, which is in line\r\nwith Venus and over which you can just see her. Put a stake where you\r\nstand. Next day go there half an hour before sunset, and stand a little\r\nto the west. You will see Venus as big as life. The next afternoon you\r\ncan find her by four o'clock. And if you keep on you will see her day\r\nbefore yesterday!\"\r\n\r\nThat was a great \"stunt.\" We did it; and there are dozens like it you\r\ncan do. And that reminds me that father was mistaken about our interest\r\nlasting only two years. We know that it will not die till we do. For,\r\neven if we never get a telescope, there will always be new things to\r\nsee. Our club has still to catch Algol, the \"demon's eye,\" which goes\r\nout and gleams forth every three days, because it is obscured by some\r\ndark planet we can never see. And we have never yet seen Mira the\r\nwonderful, which for some mysterious reason dies down to ninth magnitude\r\nand then blazes up to second magnitude every eleventh month.\r\n\r\nAh, yes, the wonders and the beauties of astronomy ever deepen and\r\nwiden. Better make friends with the stars now. For when you are old\r\nthere are no friends like old friends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DIPPERS AND THE POLE STAR\r\n\r\n\r\nI never heard of any boy or girl who didn't know the Big Dipper. But\r\nthere is one very pleasant thing about the Dipper which children never\r\nseem to know. With the aid of these seven magnificent stars you can find\r\nall the other interesting stars and constellations. So true is this that\r\na book has been written called \"The Stars through a Dipper.\"\r\n\r\nTo illustrate, do you know the _Pointers_? I mean the two stars on the\r\nfront side of the Dipper. They point almost directly toward the Pole\r\nstar, or North star, the correct name of which is Polaris. Most children\r\ncan see the Pole star at once because it is the only bright star in that\r\npart of the heavens.\r\n\r\nBut if you can't be sure you see the right one, a funny thing happens.\r\nYour friend will try to show you by pointing, but even if you look\r\nstraight along his arm you can't always be sure. And then, if he tries\r\nto tell you how far one star is from another, he will try to show you by\r\nholding his arms apart. But that fails also. And so, we all soon learn\r\nthe easiest and surest way to point out stars and measure distances.\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to tell any one how to find a star is to get three\r\nstars in a straight line, or else at right angles.\r\n\r\nThe surest way to tell any one how far one star is from another is by\r\n\"degrees.\" You know what degrees are, because every circle is divided\r\ninto 360 of them. And if you will think a moment, you will understand\r\nwhy we can see only half the sky at any one time, or 180 degrees,\r\nbecause the other half of the sky is on the other side of the earth.\r\nTherefore, if you draw a straight line from one horizon, clear up to the\r\ntop of the sky and down to the opposite horizon, it is 180 degrees long.\r\nAnd, of course, it is only half that distance, or 90 degrees, from\r\nhorizon to zenith. (Horizon is the point where earth and sky seem to\r\nmeet, and zenith is the point straight over your head.)\r\n\r\nNow ninety degrees is a mighty big distance in the sky. The Pole star is\r\nnothing like ninety degrees from the Dipper. It is only twenty-five\r\ndegrees, or about five times the distance between the Pointers. And now\r\ncomes the only thing I will ask you to remember. Look well at the two\r\nPointers, because the distance between them, five degrees, is the most\r\nconvenient \"foot rule\" for the sky that you will ever find. Most of the\r\nstars you will want to talk about are from two to five times that\r\ndistance from some other star that you and your friends are sure of.\r\nPerhaps this is a little hard to understand. If so, read it over several\r\ntimes, or get some one to explain it to you, for when you grasp it, it\r\nwill unlock almost as many pleasures as a key to the store you like the\r\nbest.\r\n\r\nNow, let's try our new-found ruler. Let us see if it will help us find\r\nthe eighth star in the Dipper. That's a famous test of sharp eyes. I\r\ndon't want to spoil your pleasure by telling you too soon where it is.\r\nPerhaps you would rather see how sharp your eyes are before reading any\r\nfurther. But if you can't find the eighth star, I will tell you where to\r\nlook.\r\n\r\nLook at the second star in the Dipper, counting from the end of the\r\nhandle. That is a famous star called Mizar. Now look all around Mizar,\r\nand then, if you can't see a little one near it, try to measure off one\r\ndegree. To do this, look at the Pointers and try to measure off about a\r\nfifth of the distance between them. Then look about one degree (or less)\r\nfrom Mizar, and I am sure you will see the little beauty--its name is\r\nAlcor, which means \"the cavalier\" or companion. The two are sometimes\r\ncalled \"_the horse and rider_\"; another name for Alcor is Saidak, which\r\nmeans \"the test.\" I shall be very much disappointed if you cannot see\r\nSaidak, because it is not considered a hard test nowadays for sharp\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nAren't these interesting names? Mizar, Alcor, Saidak. They sound so\r\nArabian, and remind one of the \"Arabian Nights.\" At first, some of them\r\nwill seem hard, but you will come to love these old names. I dare say\r\nmany of these star names are 4,000 years old. Shepherds and sailors\r\nwere the first astronomers. The sailors had to steer by the stars, and\r\nthe shepherds could lie on the ground and enjoy them without having to\r\ntwist their necks. They saw and named Alcor, thousands of years before\r\ntelescopes were invented, and long before there were any books to help\r\nthem. They saw the demon star, too, which I have never seen. It needs\r\npatience to see those things; sharp eyes are nothing to be proud of,\r\nbecause they are given to us. But patience is something to be eager\r\nabout, because it costs us a lot of trouble to get it.\r\n\r\nLet's try for it. We've had a test of sight. Now let's have a test of\r\npatience. It takes more patience than sharpness of sight to trace the\r\noutline of the Little Dipper. It has seven stars, too, and the Pole star\r\nis in the end of the handle. Do you see two rather bright stars about\r\ntwenty-five degrees from the Pole? I hope so, for they are the only\r\nbrightish stars anywhere near Polaris. Well, those two stars are in the\r\nouter rim of the Little Dipper. Now, I think you can trace it all; but\r\nto make sure you see the real thing, I will tell you the last secret.\r\nThe handle of the Big Dipper is bent _back_; the handle of the Little\r\nDipper is bent _in_.\r\n\r\nNow, if you have done all this faithfully, you have worked hard enough,\r\nand I will reward you with a story. Once upon a time there was a\r\nprincess named Callisto, and the great god Jupiter fell in love with\r\nher. Naturally, Jupiter's wife, Juno, wasn't pleased, so she changed the\r\nprincess into a bear. But before this happened, Callisto became the\r\nmother of a little boy named Arcas, who grew up to be a mighty hunter.\r\nOne day he saw a bear and he was going to kill it, not knowing that the\r\nbear was really his own mother. Luckily Jupiter interfered and saved\r\ntheir lives. He changed Arcas into a bear and put both bears into the\r\nsky. Callisto is the Big Bear, and Arcas is the Little Bear. But Juno\r\nwas angry at that, and so she went to the wife of the Ocean and said,\r\n\"Please, never let these bears come to your home.\" So the wife of the\r\nOcean said, \"I will never let them sink beneath the waves.\" And that is\r\nwhy the Big and the Little Dipper never set. They always whirl around\r\nthe Pole star. And that is why you can always see them, though some\r\nnights you would have to sit up very late.\r\n\r\nIs that a true story? No. But, I can tell you a true one that is even\r\nmore wonderful. Once upon a time, before the bear story was invented and\r\nbefore people had tin dippers, they used to think of the Little Dipper\r\nas a little dog. And so they gave a funny name to the Pole star. They\r\ncalled it Cynosura, which means \"the dog's tail.\" We sometimes say of a\r\ngreat man, \"he was the cynosure of all eyes,\" meaning that everybody\r\nlooked at him. But the original cynosure was and is the Pole star,\r\nbecause all the stars in the sky seem to revolve around it. The two\r\nDippers chase round it once every twenty-four hours, as you can convince\r\nyourself some night when you stay up late. So that's all for to-night.\r\n\r\nWhat! You want another true story? Well, just one more. Once upon a time\r\nthe Big Dipper was a perfect cross. That was about 50,000 years ago.\r\nFifty thousand years from now the Big Dipper will look like a steamer\r\nchair. How do I know that? Because, the two stars at opposite ends of\r\nthe Dipper are going in a direction different from the other five stars.\r\nHow do I know that? Why, I don't know it. I just believe it. There are\r\nlots of things I don't know, and I'm not afraid to say so. I hope you\r\nwill learn how to say \"I don't know.\" It's infinitely better than\r\nguessing; it saves trouble, and people like you better, because they see\r\nyou are honest. I don't know how the stars in the Big Dipper are moving,\r\nbut the men who look through telescopes and study mathematics say the\r\nend stars do move in a direction opposite to the others, and they say\r\nthe Dipper _must_ have looked like a cross, and will look like a dipper\r\nlong, long after we are dead. And I believe them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSTELLATIONS YOU CAN ALWAYS SEE\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are forty-eight well known constellations, but of these only about\r\na dozen are easy to know. I think a dozen is quite enough for children\r\nto learn. And therefore, I shall tell you how to find only the showiest\r\nand most interesting.\r\n\r\nThe best way to begin is to describe the ones that you can see almost\r\nevery night in the year, because you may want to begin any month in the\r\nyear, and you might be discouraged if I talked about things nobody could\r\nsee in that month. There are five constellations you can nearly always\r\nsee, and these are all near the Pole star.\r\n\r\nDoubtless you think you know two of them already--the Big and the Little\r\nDipper. Ah, I forgot to tell you that these dippers are not the real\r\nthing. They are merely parts of bigger constellations and their real\r\nnames are Great Bear and Little Bear. The oldest names are the right\r\nones. Thousands of years ago, when the Greeks named these groups of\r\nstars, they thought they looked like two bears. I can't see the\r\nresemblance.\r\n\r\nBut for that matter all the figures in the sky are disappointing. The\r\npeople who named the constellations called them lions, and fishes, and\r\nhorses, and hunters, and they thought they could see a dolphin, a\r\nsnake, a dragon, a crow, a crab, a bull, a ram, a swan, and other\r\nthings. But nowadays we cannot see those creatures. We can see the stars\r\nplainly enough, and they do make groups, but they do not look like\r\nanimals. I was greatly disappointed when I was told this; but I soon got\r\nover it, because new wonders are always coming on. I think the only\r\nhonest thing to do is to tell you right at the start that you cannot see\r\nthese creatures very well. You will spoil your pleasure unless you take\r\nthese resemblances good-naturedly and with a light heart. And you will\r\nalso spoil your pleasure if you scold the ancients for naming the\r\nconstellations badly. Nobody in the world would change those old names\r\nnow. There is too much pleasure in them. Besides, I doubt if we could do\r\nmuch better. I believe those old folks were better observers than we.\r\nAnd I believe they had a lighter fancy.\r\n\r\nLet us, too, be fanciful for once. I have asked my friend, Mrs. Thomas,\r\nto draw her notion of some of these famous creatures of the sky. You can\r\ndraw your idea of them too, and it is pleasant to compare drawings with\r\nfriends. There is only one way to see anything like a Great Bear. You\r\nhave to imagine the Dipper upside down and make the handle of the Dipper\r\nserve for the Bear's tail. What a funny bear to drag a long tail on the\r\nground! Miss Martin says he looks more like a chubby hobby-horse. You\r\nwill have to make the bowl of the Dipper into hind legs and use all the\r\nother stars, somehow, to make a big, clumsy, four-legged animal. And\r\nwhat a monster he is! He measures twenty-five degrees from the tip of\r\nhis nose to the root of his tail. Yes, all those miscellaneous faint\r\nstars you see near the Big Dipper belong to the Great Bear.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Orion fighting the Bull. Above are Orion's two dogs]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Little Bear, the Queen in her chair, the Twins and\r\nthe Archer]\r\n\r\nHow the Great Bear looked to the people who named it thousands of years\r\nago, we probably shall never know. They left no books or drawings, so\r\nfar as I know. But in every dictionary and book on astronomy you can\r\nfind these bears and other animals drawn so carefully and beautifully\r\nthat it seems as if they _must_ be in the sky, and we must be too dull\r\nto see them. It is not so. Look at the pictures in this book and, you\r\nwill see that the stars do not outline the animals. Many of them come at\r\nthe wrong places. And so it is with all the costly books and charts and\r\nplanispheres. It is all very interesting, but it isn't true. It's just\r\nfancy. And when you once understand that it isn't true, you will begin\r\nto enjoy the fancy. Many a smile you will have, and sometimes a good\r\nlaugh. For instance, the English children call the Dipper \"Charles's\r\nwain\" or \"the wagon.\" And the Romans called it \"the plough.\" They\r\nthought of those seven stars as oxen drawing a plough.\r\n\r\nWell, that's enough about the two Bears. I want to tell you about the\r\nother three constellations you can nearly always see. These are the\r\nChair, the Charioteer, and Perseus (pronounced _per'soos_).\r\n\r\nThe Chair is the easiest to find, because it is like a very bad W, and\r\nit is always directly opposite the big Dipper, with the Pole star half\r\nway between the two constellations. There are five stars in the W, and\r\nto make the W into a Chair you must add a fainter star which helps to\r\nmake the square bottom of the chair. But what a crazy piece of\r\nfurniture! I have seen several ways of drawing it, but none of them\r\nmakes a comfortable chair. I should either fall over backward, or else\r\nthe back of the chair would prod me in the small of my back. The correct\r\nname of this constellation is Cassiopeia's Chair.\r\n\r\nI think this is enough to see and enjoy in one night. To-morrow night\r\nlet us look for the Charioteer.\r\n\r\nI love the Charioteer for several reasons. One is that it makes a\r\nbeautiful pentagon, or five-sided figure, with its five brightest stars.\r\nAnother is that it contains the second-brightest star in the northern\r\npart of the heavens, Capella. The only star in the north that is\r\nbrighter is Vega, but Vega is bluish white or creamy.\r\n\r\nIf you haven't already found the five-sided figure, I will tell you how\r\nto find Capella. Suppose you had a gun that would shoot anything as far\r\nas you wish. Shoot a white string right through the Pointers and hit the\r\nPole star. Then place your gun at the Pole star and turn it till it is\r\nat right angles to that string you shot. Aim away from the big Dipper,\r\nshoot a bullet forty-five degrees and it will hit Capella.\r\n\r\nIf that plan doesn't work, try this. Start with the star that is at the\r\nbottom of the Dipper and nearest the handle. Draw a line half-way\r\nbetween the two Pointers and keep on till you come to the first bright\r\nstar. This is Capella, and the distance is about fifty degrees.\r\n\r\nCapella means \"a kid,\" or \"little goat,\" and that reminds me of the\r\nthird reason why I enjoy so much the constellation of which Capella is\r\nthe brightest star. In the old times they sometimes called this\r\nfive-sided figure \"the goat-carrier.\" And the shepherds thought they\r\ncould see a man carrying a little goat in his left hand. I am sure you\r\ncan see the kid they meant. It is a triangle of faint stars which you\r\nsee near Capella. That's enough for to-night.\r\n\r\nTo-morrow night let us look for Perseus. I dare say you know that old\r\ntale about Perseus rescuing the princess who was chained upon a rock.\r\n(He cut off the snaky head of Medusa and showed it to the dragon that\r\nwas going to devour the princess, and it turned the monster to stone.\r\nRemember?) Well, there are constellations named after all the people in\r\nthat story, but although they contain many showy stars, I could never\r\nmake them look like a hero, a princess, a king, and a queen. I do not\r\neven try to trace out all of Perseus. For I am satisfied to enjoy a very\r\nbeautiful part of it which is called the \"Arc of Perseus.\"\r\n\r\nAn arc, you know, is a portion of a circle. And the way to find this arc\r\nis to draw a curve from Capella to Cassiopeia. On nights that are not\r\nvery clear I can see about seven stars in this Arc of Perseus. And the\r\nreason I love it so much is that it is the most beautiful thing, when\r\nseen through an opera-glass, that I know. You could never imagine that a\r\nmere opera-glass would make such a difference. The moment I put it to my\r\neyes about a dozen more stars suddenly leap into my sight in and near\r\nthe Arc of Perseus. That's enough. No more stories to-night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWINTER CONSTELLATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nBy winter constellations I mean those you can see in winter at the\r\npleasantest time--the early evening. And I want you to begin with the\r\nNorthern Cross. I hope you can see this before Christmas, for, after\r\nthat, it may be hidden by trees or buildings in the west and you may not\r\nsee it again for a long while. This is because the stars seem to rise in\r\nthe east and set in the west. To prove this, choose some brilliant star\r\nyou can see at five or six o'clock; get it in line with some bush or\r\nother object over which you can just see it. Put a stake where you\r\nstand, and then go to the same spot about eight o'clock or just before\r\nyou go to bed. You can tell at once how much the star seems to have\r\nmoved westward.\r\n\r\nAnother thing, every star rises four minutes later every night, and\r\ntherefore the sky looks a little different at the same hour every\r\nevening. The stars in the north set for a short time only, but when\r\nthose toward the south set they are gone a long time. For instance, the\r\nbrightest star of all is Sirius, the Dog Star, which really belongs to\r\nthe southern hemisphere. There are only about three months in the year\r\nwhen children who go to bed by seven o'clock can see it--January,\r\nFebruary, and March.\r\n\r\nSo now you understand why I am so eager that you should not miss the\r\npleasure of seeing the famous Northern Cross. But although it is a big\r\ncross, and easy to find, after you know it, I have never yet known a boy\r\nwho could show it to another boy simply by pointing at it. The surest\r\nand best way to find it is learn three bright stars first--Altair, Vega,\r\nand Deneb.\r\n\r\nAltair is the brightest star in the Milky Way. It is just at the edge of\r\nthe Milky Way, and you are to look for three stars in a straight line,\r\nwith the middle one brightest. Those three stars make the constellation\r\ncalled \"the Eagle.\" The body of the eagle is Altair, and the other two\r\nstars are the wings. I should say that Altair is about five degrees from\r\neach of his companions. It is worth half an hour's patient search to\r\nfind the Eagle. Now these three stars in the Eagle point straight toward\r\nthe brightest star in the northern part of the sky--Vega.\r\n\r\nTo make sure of it, notice four fainter stars near it which make a\r\nparallelogram--a sort of diamond. These stars are all part of a\r\nconstellation called \"the Lyre.\" If you try to trace out the old musical\r\ninstrument, you will be disappointed; but here is a game worth while.\r\nCan you see a small triangle made by three stars, of which Vega is one?\r\nWell, one of those stars is double, and with an opera-glass you can see\r\nwhich it is. On very clear nights some people with very sharp eyes can\r\nsee them lying close together, but I never could.\r\n\r\nAt last we are ready to find the celebrated Northern Cross. First draw a\r\nline from Altair to Vega. Then draw a line at right angles to this,\r\nuntil you come to another bright star--Deneb--which is about as far from\r\nVega as Vega is from Altair. Now this beautiful star, Deneb, is the top\r\nof the Northern Cross. I can't tell you whether the Cross will be right\r\nor wrong side up when you see it, or on its side. For every\r\nconstellation is likely to change its position during the night, as you\r\nknow from watching the Dipper. But you can tell the Cross by these\r\nthings. There are six stars in it. It is like a kite made of two sticks.\r\nThere are three stars in the crosspiece and four in the long piece.\r\nDeneb, the brightest star in the cross, is at the top of the long stick.\r\n\r\nBut you mustn't expect to see a perfect cross. There is one star that is\r\na little out of place, and sometimes my fingers fairly \"itch to put it\r\nwhere it belongs.\" It is the one that ought to be where the long stick\r\nof your kite is tacked to the crosspiece. And one of the stars is\r\nprovokingly faint, but you can see it. Counting straight down the long\r\npiece, it is the third one from Deneb that is faint. It is where it\r\nought to be, but I should like to make it brighter. Have you the Cross\r\nnow? If not, have patience. You can't be a \"true sport\" unless you are\r\npatient. You can't be a great ball-player, or hunter, or any thing else,\r\nwithout resisting, every day, that sudden impulse to \"quit the game\"\r\nwhen you lose. Be a \"good loser,\" smile and try again. That is better\r\nthan to give up, or to win by cheating or sharp practice.\r\n\r\nThis is the last thing I want you to see in the northern part of the\r\nsky; and if you have done a good job, let us celebrate by having a\r\nstory.\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time a cross didn't mean so much to the world as it does\r\nnow. That was before Christ was born. In those old times people did not\r\nthink of the Northern Cross as a cross. They thought of it as a Swan,\r\nand you can see the Swan if you turn the Cross upside down. Deneb will\r\nthen be in the tail of the Swan, and the two stars which used to be at\r\nthe tips of the crosspiece now become the wings. Is that a true story?\r\nYes. If we lived in Arabia the children there could tell us what Deneb\r\nmeans. It means \"the tail.\"\r\n\r\nAnother story? Well, do you see the star in the beak of the Swan, or\r\nfoot of the Cross? What color is it? White? Well, they say this white\r\nstar is really made up of two stars--one yellow and the other blue. That\r\nis one reason I want to buy a telescope when I can afford it, for even\r\nthe smallest telescope will show that. And Mr. Serviss says that even a\r\nstrong field-glass will help any one see this wonder.\r\n\r\nI can't tell you about all the winter constellations in one chapter. We\r\nhave made friends of the northern ones. Now let's see the famous\r\nsouthern ones. And let's start a new chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORION, HIS DOGS, AND THE BULL\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most gorgeous constellation in the whole sky is Orion. I really pity\r\nany one who does not know it, because it has more bright stars in it\r\nthan any other group. Besides, it doesn't take much imagination to see\r\nthis mighty hunter fighting the great Bull. I dare say half the people\r\nin the United States know Orion and can tell him as quick as they see\r\nhim by the famous \"belt of Orion.\"\r\n\r\nThis belt is made of three stars, each of which is just one degree from\r\nthe next. That is why the English people call these three stars \"the ell\r\nand yard.\" Another name for them is \"the three kings.\" You can see the\r\n\"sword of Orion\" hanging down from his belt.\r\n\r\nAs soon as you see these things you will see the four bright stars that\r\noutline the figure of the great hunter, but only two of them are of the\r\nfirst magnitude. The red one has a hard name--Betelgeuse (pronounced\r\n_bet-el-guz´_). That is a Frenchified word from the Arabic, meaning\r\n\"armpit,\" because this star marks the right shoulder of Orion. The other\r\nfirst-magnitude star is the big white one in the left foot. Its name is\r\nRigel (pronounced _re´-jel_) from an Arabian word meaning \"the foot.\"\r\n\r\nYou can see the giant now, I am sure. Over his left arm hangs a lion's\r\nskin which he holds out to shield him from the bull's horns. See the\r\nshield--about four rather faint stars in a pretty good curve? Now look\r\nfor his club which he holds up with his right hand so as to smite the\r\nbull. See the arm and the club--about seven stars in a rather poor\r\ncurve--beyond the red star Betelgeuse? Now you have him, and isn't he a\r\nwonder!\r\n\r\nIt is even easier to see the Bull which is trying to gore Orion. Look\r\nwhere Orion is threatening to strike, and you will see a V. How many\r\nstars in that V? Five. And which is the brightest? That red one at the\r\ntop of the left branch of the V? Yes. That V is the face of the Bull and\r\nthat red star is the baleful eye of the angry Bull which is lowering his\r\nhead and trying to toss Orion. The name of that red eye is Aldebaran\r\n(pronounced _al-deb´-ar-an_).\r\n\r\nI wish Aldebaran meant \"red eye,\" but it doesn't. It is an old Arabian\r\nword meaning the \"hindmost,\" or the \"follower,\" because every evening it\r\ncomes into view about an hour after you can see the famous group of\r\nstars called the Pleiades, which are in the shoulder of the Bull.\r\n\r\nI do not care to trace the outline of this enormous bull, but his horns\r\nare a great deal longer than you think at first. If you will extend the\r\ntwo arms of that V a long way you will see two stars which may be called\r\nthe tips of his horns. One of these stars really belongs in another\r\nconstellation--our old friend the Charioteer, the one including\r\nCapella. Wow! what a pair of horns!\r\n\r\nBut now we come to the daintiest of all constellations--the Seven\r\nSisters, or Pleiades (pronounced _plee´-a-deez_).\r\n\r\nI can see only six of them, and there is a famous old tale about the\r\n\"lost Pleiad.\" But I needn't describe them. Every child finds them by\r\ninstinct. Some compare them to a swarm of bees; some to a rosette of\r\ndiamonds; some to dewdrops. But I would not compare them to a dipper as\r\nsome do, because the real Little Dipper is very different. The light\r\nthat seems to drip from the Pleiades is quivering, misty, romantic,\r\nmagical. No wonder many children love the Pleiades best of all the\r\nconstellations. No wonder the poets have praised them for thousands of\r\nyears. The oldest piece of poetry about them that I know of was written\r\nabout 1,500 years before Christ. You can find it in the book of Job. But\r\nthe most poetic description of the Pleiades that I have ever read is in\r\nTennyson's poem \"Locksley Hall,\" in which he says they \"glitter like a\r\nswarm of fireflies tangled in a silver braid.\"\r\n\r\nThere are a great many old tales about the lost Pleiad. One is that she\r\nveiled her face because the ancient city of Troy was burned. Another\r\nstory says she ceased to be a goddess when she married a man and became\r\nmortal. Some people think she was struck by lightning. Others believe\r\nthe big star, Canopus, came by and ran away with her. Still others\r\ndeclare she was a new star that appeared suddenly once upon a time, and\r\nafter a while faded away.\r\n\r\nFor myself, I do not believe any of these stories. One reason why I\r\ndon't is that a seventh star is really there, and many people can really\r\nsee it. Indeed, there are some people so sharp-eyed that on clear nights\r\nthey can see anywhere from eight to eleven. And, what is more, they can\r\ndraw a map or chart showing just where each star seems to them to be.\r\n\r\nBut the most wonderful stories about the Pleiades are the true stories.\r\nOne is that there are really more than 3,000 stars among the Pleiades.\r\nSome of them can be seen only with the biggest telescopes. Others are\r\nrevealed only by the spectroscope. And some can be found only by means\r\nof photography.\r\n\r\nBut the most amazing thing about the Pleiades is the distances between\r\nthem. They look so close together that you would probably say \"the moon\r\nseems bigger than all of them put together.\" Sometimes the moon comes\r\nnear the Pleiades, and you expect that the moon will blot them all out.\r\nBut the astronomers say the full moon sails through the Pleiades and\r\ncovers only one of them at a time, as a rule. They even say it is\r\npossible for the moon to pass through the Pleiades without touching one\r\nof them! I should like to see that. If anything like it is going to\r\noccur, the magazine I spoke of in the first chapter will tell me about\r\nit. And you'd better believe I will stay up to see that, if it takes all\r\nnight!\r\n\r\nThere are two more constellations in the southern part of the sky that\r\nought to be interesting, because they are the two hunting dogs that help\r\nOrion fight the Bull. But I can't trace these animals, and I don't\r\nbelieve it is worth while. The brightest stars in them everybody can see\r\nand admire--Sirius, the Bigger Dog, and Procyon, the Smaller Dog.\r\n\r\nEvery one ought to know Sirius, because he is the brightest star of all.\r\n(Of course, he is not so bright as Venus and Jupiter, but they are\r\nplanets.) To find him, draw a line from the eye of the Bull through the\r\nbelt of Orion and extend it toward the southeast about twenty degrees.\r\nThey call him the Dog star because he follows the heels of Orion. And\r\npeople still call the hottest days of summer \"dog days\" because 400\r\nyears before Christ the Romans noticed that the Dog star rose just\r\nbefore the sun at that time. The Romans thought he chased the sun across\r\nthe sky all day and therefore was responsible for the great heat. But\r\nthat was a foolish explanation. And so is the old notion that dogs are\r\nlikely to go mad during the dog days \"because the dog star is in the\r\nascendant.\" So is the idea that Sirius is an unlucky star.\r\n\r\nThere are no lucky or unlucky stars. These are all superstitions, and we\r\nought to be ashamed to believe any superstition. Yet for thousands of\r\nyears before we had public schools and learned to know better, people\r\nbelieved that every one was born under a lucky star or an unlucky one,\r\nand they believe that farmers ought to plant or not plant, according to\r\nthe size of the moon. Now we know that is all bosh. Those old\r\nsuperstitions have done more harm than good. One of the most harmful was\r\nthe belief in witches. Let us resolve never to be afraid of these old\r\ntales, but laugh at them.\r\n\r\nWhy should anybody be afraid of anything so lovely as Sirius? I used to\r\nthink Sirius twinkled more than any other star. But that was bad\r\nreasoning on my part. I might have noticed that every star twinkles more\r\nnear the horizon than toward the zenith. I might have noticed that stars\r\ntwinkle more on clear, frosty nights than when there is a little uniform\r\nhaze. And putting those two facts together I might have reasoned that\r\nthe stars never really twinkle at all; they only seem to. I might have\r\nconcluded that the twinkling is all due to the atmosphere--that blanket\r\nof air which wraps the earth around. The nearer the earth, the thicker\r\nthe air, and the more it interferes with the light that comes to us from\r\nthe stars.\r\n\r\nThey say that Sirius never looks exactly alike on two successive nights.\r\n\"It has a hundred moods,\" says Mr. Serviss, \"according to the state of\r\nthe atmosphere. By turns it flames, it sparkles, it glows, it blazes, it\r\nflares, it flashes, it contracts to a point, and sometimes when the air\r\nis still, it burns with a steady white light.\" (Quotation somewhat\r\naltered and condensed.)\r\n\r\nIt is a pity that so fine a star as Procyon should be called the\r\n\"Smaller Dog,\" because it suffers unjustly by comparison with Sirius. If\r\nit were in some other part of the sky we might appreciate it more,\r\nbecause it is brighter than most of the fifteen first-magnitude stars we\r\ncan see. My brother William has grown to love it, but perhaps that is\r\nbecause he always \"sympathizes with the under dog.\" He was the youngest\r\nbrother and knows. And curiously enough he was nicknamed \"the dog\"--just\r\nwhy, I don't know.\r\n\r\nTo find Procyon, drawn a line from Sirius northeast about twenty\r\ndegrees. And to make sure, draw one east from Betelgeuse about the same\r\ndistance. These three stars make a triangle of which the sides are\r\nalmost equal.\r\n\r\nThe name Procyon means \"before the dog\" referring to the fact that you\r\ncan see him fifteen or twenty minutes earlier every night than you can\r\nsee Sirius.\r\n\r\nThe only kind word about Procyon I have heard in recent years was in\r\nconnection with that miserable business of Dr. Cook and the North Pole.\r\nA Captain Somebody-or-other was making observations for Dr. Cook, and he\r\nwanted to know what time it was. He had no watch and didn't want to\r\ndisturb any one. So he looked out of the window and saw by the star\r\nProcyon that it was eleven o'clock.\r\n\r\nThat sounds mysterious, but it is easy if you have a planisphere like\r\nours. Last winter when we were all enjoying Orion, the Bull, and the two\r\nDogs, I used to whirl the planisphere around to see where they would be\r\nat six o'clock at night, at eight, at ten, at midnight, and even at six\r\no'clock in the morning. And so, if I waked up in the night I could tell\r\nwhat time it was without even turning my head. Sometimes I looked out of\r\nmy window, saw Orion nearly overhead and knew it must be midnight. And\r\nsometimes I woke up just before daybreak and saw the great Bull backing\r\ndown out of sight in the west, the mighty Hunter still brandishing his\r\nclub, and his faithful Dogs following at his heels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSEVEN FAMOUS CONSTELLATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are only seven more constellations that seem to me interesting\r\nenough for every one to know and love all his life. These are:\r\n\r\n  The Lion (Spring)\r\n\r\n  The Twins (Spring)\r\n\r\n  The Virgin (Summer)\r\n\r\n  The Herdsman (Summer)\r\n\r\n  The Northern Crown (Summer)\r\n\r\n  The Scorpion (Summer)\r\n\r\n  Southern Fish (Autumn)\r\n\r\nI have named the seasons when, according to some people, these\r\nconstellations are most enjoyable. But these are not the only times when\r\nyou can see them. (If you had that seventy-five-cent planisphere, now,\r\nyou could always tell which constellations are visible and just where to\r\nfind them.) No matter what time of year you read this chapter, it is\r\nworth while to go out and look for these marvels. You can't possibly\r\nmiss them all.\r\n\r\nHave you ever seen a Sickle in the sky? It's a beauty, and whenever I\r\nhave seen it it has been turned very conveniently for me, because I am\r\nleft-handed. It is so easy to find that I am almost ashamed to tell. But\r\nif you need help, draw a line through the Pointers backward, away from\r\nthe Pole star, about forty degrees, and it will come a little west of\r\nthe Sickle. The Sickle is only part of the Lion--the head and the\r\nforequarters. Only fanciful map-makers can trace the rest of the Lion.\r\nThe bright star at the end of the handle is Regulus, which means \"king,\"\r\nfrom the stupid old notion that this star ruled the lives of men. To\r\nthis day people speak of the \"Royal Star,\" meaning Regulus. And at the\r\nend of this chapter I will tell you about three other stars which the\r\nPersians called \"royal stars.\"\r\n\r\nAnother constellation which children particularly love is the\r\nTwins--Castor and Pollux. But the sailors got there first! For thousands\r\nof years the twins have been supposed to bring good luck to sailors. I\r\ndon't believe a word of it. But I do know that sailors gloat over Castor\r\nand Pollux, and like them better than any other stars. The whole\r\nconstellation includes all the stars east of the Bull and between the\r\nCharioteer and Procyon. But another way to outline the twins is to look\r\nnortheast of Orion where you will see two rows of stars that run nearly\r\nparallel. To me the brothers seem to be standing, but all the old\r\npicture-makers show them sitting with their arms around each other, the\r\ntwo brightest stars being their eyes. The eyes are about five degrees\r\napart--the same as the Pointers.\r\n\r\nPollux is now brighter than Castor, but for thousands of years it was\r\njust the other way. It is only within three hundred years that this\r\nchange has taken place. Whether Castor has faded or Pollux brightened,\r\nor both, I do not know. Anyhow, Castor is not quite bright enough to be\r\na first magnitude star. Three hundred years is a short time in the\r\nhistory of man, and only a speck in the history of the stars. Three\r\nhundred years ago they killed people in Europe just because of the\r\nchurch they went to. That was why the Pilgrim Fathers sailed from\r\nEngland in 1620, and made the first permanent settlement in America,\r\nexcept, of course, Jamestown, Va., in 1607.\r\n\r\nThere are plenty of stories about old Castor and Pollux, and, like all\r\nthe other myths, they conflict, more or less. But all agree that these\r\ntwo brothers went with Jason in the ship Argo, shared his adventures and\r\nhelped him get the golden fleece. And all agree that Castor and Pollux\r\nwere \"born fighters.\" And that is why the Roman soldiers looked up to\r\nthese stars and prayed to them to help them win their battles.\r\n\r\nNow for the four summer constellations every one ought to know. The\r\nfirst thing to look for is two famous red or reddish stars--Arcturus and\r\nAntares.\r\n\r\nThe way you find Arcturus is amusing. Look for the Big Dipper and find\r\nthe star at the bottom of the dipper nearest the handle. Got it? Now\r\ndraw a curve that will connect it with all the stars in the handle, and\r\nwhen you come to the end of the handle keep on till you come to the\r\nfirst very bright star--about twenty-five degrees. That is the monstrous\r\nstar Arcturus, probably the biggest and swiftest star we can ever see\r\nwith the naked eye in the northern hemisphere. He is several times as\r\nbig as our sun, and his diameter is supposed to be several million\r\nmiles. He is called a \"runaway sun,\" because he is rushing through space\r\nat the rate of between two hundred and three hundred miles a second.\r\nThat means between seventeen and thirty-four million miles a day!\r\n\r\nHe is coming toward us, too! At such a rate you might think that\r\nArcturus would have smashed the earth to pieces long ago. But he is\r\nstill very far away, and there is no danger. Some people say that if Job\r\nwere to come to life, the sky would seem just the same to him as it did\r\n3,400 years ago. The only difference he might notice would be in\r\nArcturus. That would seem to him out of place by a distance about three\r\ntimes the apparent diameter of the moon.\r\n\r\nSome people believe this because Job said, \"Canst thou guide Arcturus\r\nwith his sons?\" and therefore they imagine that he meant this red star.\r\nBut I believe he meant the Big Dipper. For in King James's time, when\r\nthe Bible was translated into English, the word \"Arcturus\" meant the Big\r\nDipper or rather the Great Bear. And for centuries before it meant the\r\nGreat Bear. One proof of it is that \"Arcturus\" comes from an old Greek\r\nword meaning \"bear\"--the same word from which we get arctic. It is only\r\nwithin a few hundred years that astronomers have agreed to call the\r\nGreat Bear \"Ursa Major,\" and this red star Arcturus. So I think all the\r\nbooks which say Job mentioned this red star are mistaken. I believe\r\nWebster's Dictionary is correct in this matter, and I believe the\r\nRevised Version translates Job's Hebrew phrase more correctly when it\r\nsays, \"Canst thou guide the Bear with her train?\"\r\n\r\nAnyhow, Arcturus is a splendid star--the brightest in the constellation\r\ncalled the \"Herdsman\" or Boötes. It is not worth while to trace the\r\nHerdsman, but here is an interesting question. Is Arcturus really red?\r\nThe books mostly say he is yellow. They say he looks red when he is low\r\nin the sky, and yellow when he is high. How does he look to you? More\r\nyellow than red?\r\n\r\nWell, there's no doubt about Antares being red. To find him, draw a long\r\nline from Regulus through Arcturus to Antares, Arcturus being more than\r\nhalf way between the other two. But if Regulus and the Sickle are not\r\nvisible, draw a line from Altair, at right angles to the Eagle, until\r\nyou come to a bright star about sixty degrees away. You can't miss\r\nAntares, for he is the only red star in that part of the sky.\r\n\r\nAntares belongs to a showy constellation called the Scorpion. I cannot\r\ntrace all the outline of a spider-like creature, but his poisonous tail\r\nor \"stinger\" is made by a curved line of stars south and east of\r\nAntares. And you can make a pretty fan by joining Antares to several\r\nstars in a curve which are west of Antares and a little north. There is\r\nan old tale that this Scorpion is the one that stung Orion to death when\r\nhe began to \"show off\" and boast that there was no animal in the world\r\nthat could kill him.\r\n\r\nAnother very bright star in the southern part of the sky is Spica. To\r\nfind it, start with the handle of the Dipper, and making the same\r\nbackward curve which helped you to find Arcturus, keep on till you come\r\nto the white star Spica--say thirty degrees beyond Arcturus. This is the\r\nbrightest star in the constellation called \"the Virgin.\" It is not worth\r\nwhile trying to trace her among nearly forty faint stars in this\r\nneighbourhood. But she is supposed to be a winged goddess who holds up\r\nin her right hand an _ear of wheat_, and that is what Spica means.\r\n\r\nNow for an autumn constellation--the Southern Fish. I don't care if you\r\nfail to outline a fish, but I do want you to see the bright star that is\r\nsupposed to be in the fish's mouth. And I don't want you to balk at its\r\nhard name--Fomalhaut (pronounced _fo´-mal-o_). It is worth a lot of\r\ntrouble to know it as a friend. To find it, you have to draw an\r\nexceedingly long line two-thirds of the way across the whole sky. Start\r\nwith the Pointers. Draw a line through them and the Pole star and keep\r\nclear on until you come to a solitary bright star rather low down in the\r\nsouth. That is Fomalhaut. It looks lonely and is lonely, even when you\r\nlook at it through a telescope.\r\n\r\nAnd now for the last story. Once upon a time the Persians thought there\r\nmust be four stars that rule the lives of men. So they picked out one in\r\nthe north and one in the south and one in the east and one in the west,\r\njust as if they were looking for four bright stars to mark the points of\r\nthe compass. If you want to find them yourself without my help don't\r\nread the next sentence, but shut this book and go out and see. Then\r\nwrite down on a piece of paper the stars you have selected and compare\r\nthem with the list I am about to give. Here are the four royal stars of\r\nthe Persians: Fomalhaut for the north, Regulus for the south, Aldebaran\r\nfor the east, and Antares for the west.\r\n\r\nWhy doesn't this list agree with yours? Because Persia is so far south\r\nof where we live. Ah, there are very few things that are absolutely\r\ntrue. Let's remember that and not be too sure: for everything depends\r\nupon the point of view! I hope you will see Fomalhaut before Christmas,\r\nbefore he disappears in the west. He is with us only five months and is\r\nalways low--near the horizon. But the other seven months in the year he\r\ngladdens the children of South America and the rest of the southern\r\nhemisphere, for they see him sweeping high and lonely far up into their\r\nsky and down again.\r\n\r\nBut the loveliest of all the constellations described in this chapter is\r\nthe Northern Crown. It is not a perfect crown--only about half a\r\ncircle--but enough to suggest a complete ring. Look for it east of\r\nArcturus. I can see seven or eight stars in the half-circle, one of\r\nwhich is brighter than all the others. That one is called \"the Pearl.\"\r\nThe whole constellation is only fifteen degrees long, but \"fine things\r\ncome in small packages\"; and children grow to love the Northern Crown\r\nalmost as much as they love the Pleiades.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TWENTY BRIGHTEST STARS\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you have seen everything I have described so far, you have reason to\r\nbe happy. For now you know sixteen of the most famous constellations and\r\nfifteen of the twenty brightest stars. There are only twenty stars of\r\nthe first magnitude. \"Magnitude\" ought to mean size, but it doesn't. It\r\nmeans brightness--or rather the apparent brightness--of the stars when\r\nseen by us. The word magnitude was used in the old days before\r\ntelescopes, when people thought the brighter a star is the bigger it\r\nmust be. Now we know that the nearer a star is to us the brighter it is,\r\nand the farther away the fainter. Some of the bright stars are\r\ncomparatively near us, some are very far. Deneb and Canopus are so far\r\naway that it takes over three hundred years for their light to reach us.\r\nWhat whoppers they must be--many times as big as our sun.\r\n\r\nHere is a full list of the twenty stars of the first magnitude arranged\r\nin the order of their brightness. You will find this table very useful.\r\n\r\n ----------------+---------------+-------------+--------------------------\r\n  Stars          | Pronounced    |Constellation|   Interesting facts\r\n ----------------+---------------+-------------+--------------------------\r\n Sirius          | _sir´i-us_    | Big Dog     | Brightest star.

Last winter I went to Florida\r\nand saw Canopus, but to see the Southern Cross you should cross the\r\nTropic of Cancer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO LEARN MORE\r\n\r\n\r\nAll I can hope to do in this book is to get you enthusiastic about\r\nastronomy. I don't mean \"gushy.\" Look in the dictionary and you will\r\nfind that the enthusiast is not the faddist. He is the one who sticks to\r\na subject for a lifetime.\r\n\r\nNor do I care a rap whether you become an astronomer--or even buy a\r\ntelescope. There will be always astronomers coming on, but there are too\r\nfew people who know and love even a few of the stars. I want you to make\r\npopular astronomy a life-long hobby. Perhaps you may have to drop it for\r\nten or fifteen years. Never mind, you will take up the study again. I\r\ncan't expect you to read a book on stars if you are fighting to make a\r\nliving or support a family, unless it really rests you to read about the\r\nstars. It does rest me. When things go wrong at the office or at home, I\r\ncan generally find rest and comfort from music. And if the sky is clear,\r\nI can look at the stars, and my cares suddenly seem small and drop away.\r\n\r\nLet me tell you why and how you can get the very best the stars have to\r\nteach you, without mathematics or telescope. Follow this programme and\r\nyou need never be afraid of hard work, or of exhausting the pleasures\r\nof the subject. Go to your public library and get one of the books I\r\nrecommend in this chapter, and read whatever interests you. I don't care\r\nwhether you take up planets before comets or comets before planets, but\r\nwhatever you do do it well. Soak the interesting facts right in. Nail\r\nthem down. See everything the book talks about. Make notes of things to\r\nwatch for. Get a little blank book and write down the date you first saw\r\neach thing of interest. Write down the names of the constellations you\r\nlove most. Before you lay down any star book you are reading, jot down\r\nthe most wonderful and inspiring thing you have read--even if you have\r\nonly time to write a single word that may recall it all to you. Treasure\r\nthat little note book as long as you live. Every year it will get more\r\nprecious to you.\r\n\r\nNow for the books:\r\n\r\n1. _Martin._ _The Friendly Stars._ Harper & Brothers, New York, 1907.\r\n\r\nThis book teaches you first the twenty brightest stars and then the\r\nconstellations. I cannot say that this, or any other, is the \"best\r\nbook,\" but it has helped me most, and I suppose it is only natural that\r\nwe should love best the first book that introduces us to a delightful\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n2. _Serviss._ _Astronomy with the Naked Eye._ Harper & Brothers, New\r\nYork, 1908.\r\n\r\nThis teaches you the constellations first and the brightest stars\r\nincidentally. Also it gives the old myths.\r\n\r\n3. _Serviss._ _Astronomy with an Opera-Glass._ D. Appleton & Co., New\r\nYork, 1906.\r\n\r\n4. _Serviss._ _Pleasures of the Telescope._ D. Appleton & Co., New York,\r\n1905.\r\n\r\n5. _Milham._ _How to Identify the Stars._ The Macmillan Co., New York,\r\n1909.\r\n\r\nThis gives a list of eighty-eight constellations, including thirty-six\r\nsouthern ones, and has tracings of twenty-eight.\r\n\r\n6. _Elson._ _Star Gazer's Handbook._ Sturgis & Walton Co., New York,\r\n1909.\r\n\r\nAbout the briefest and cheapest.

I got mine from Thomas Whittaker, No. 2 Bible House, New\r\nYork. It cost seventy-five cents, and will tell you where to find any\r\nstar at any time in the year. It does not show the planets, however. A\r\nplanisphere that will show the planets costs about five dollars.\r\nHowever, there are only two very showy planets, viz., Venus and Jupiter.\r\nAny almanac will tell you (for nothing) when each of these is morning\r\nstar, and when each of them is evening star.\r\n\r\nThe best newspaper about stars, as far as I know, is a magazine called\r\n_The Monthly Evening Sky Map_, published by Leon Barritt, 150 Nassau\r\nSt., New York. It costs a dollar a year. It gives a chart every month,\r\nshowing all the planets, and all the constellations. Also it tells you\r\nabout the interesting things, like comets, before they come.\r\n\r\nGood-bye. I hope you will never cease to learn about and love the earth\r\nand the sky. Perhaps you think you have learned a great deal already.\r\nBut your pleasures have only begun. Wait till you learn about how the\r\nworld began, the sun and all his planets, the distances between the\r\nstars, and the millions of blazing suns amid the Milky Way!\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SKY IN WINTER]\r\n\r\nNOTE.--These simplified star maps are not as accurate as a planisphere,\r\nbut they may be easier for children. All star maps are like ordinary\r\nmaps, except that east and west are transposed. The reason for this is\r\nthat you can hold a star map over your head, with the pole star toward\r\nthe north, and the map will then match the sky. These maps contain some\r\nconstellations that are only for grown-ups to study. The Winter\r\nconstellations every child should know are:\r\n\r\n  AURIGA, the Charioteer\r\n  CANIS MAJOR, the Big Dog\r\n  CANIS MINOR, the Little Dog\r\n  CASSIOPEIA, the Queen in Her Chair\r\n  CYGNUS, the Swan\r\n  LEO, the Lion\r\n  ORION, the Hunter\r\n  PERSEUS, Which Has the Arc\r\n  TAURUS, the Bull\r\n  URSA MAJOR, the Great Bear\r\n  URSA MINOR, the Little Bear\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SKY IN SPRING]\r\n\r\nNOTE.--Once upon a time all the educated people spoke Latin. It was the\r\nnearest approach to a universal language. So most of the constellations\r\nhave Latin names. The English, French and German names are all\r\ndifferent, but if all children would learn the Latin names they could\r\nunderstand one another. The Spring constellations every child should\r\nknow are:\r\n\r\n  LEO, the Lion\r\n  LYRA, the Lyre\r\n  CASSIOPEIA, the Queen in her Chair\r\n  SCORPIO, the Scorpion\r\n  URSA MAJOR, the Great Bear\r\n  URSA MINOR, the Little Bear\r\n  VIRGO, the Virgin\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SKY IN SUMMER]\r\n\r\nNOTE.--Every sky map is good for three months, in this way: If this is\r\ncorrect on June 1st at 10 P.M., it will be correct July 1st at 8 P.M.,\r\nand August 1st at 6 P.M. This is because the stars rise four minutes\r\nearlier every night. Thus, after thirty days, any star will rise thirty\r\ntimes four minutes earlier, or 120 minutes, or two hours. Children need\r\nnot learn all the Summer constellations. The most interesting are:\r\n\r\n  AURIGA, the Charioteer\r\n  CANIS MAJOR, the Big Dog\r\n  CYGNUS, the Swan\r\n  LYRA, the Lyre\r\n  SCORPIO, the Scorpion\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SKY IN AUTUMN]\r\n\r\nNOTE.--This book tells how to find all the most interesting stars and\r\nconstellations without maps, but many people prefer them. How to use\r\nstar maps is explained under \"The Sky in Winter.\" The Autumn\r\nconstellations most interesting to children are:\r\n\r\n  AQUILA, the Eagle\r\n  AURIGA, the Charioteer\r\n  CASSIOPEIA, the Queen in Her Chair\r\n  CYGNUS, the Swan\r\n  LYRA, the Lyre\r\n  PERSEUS, Which Has the Arc\r\n  TAURUS, the Bull\r\n  URSA MAJOR, the Great Bear\r\n  URSA MINOR, the Little Bear\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber's notes\r\n\r\n  Page 124 \"streams, runing\" corrected to \"streams, running\"\r\n  Page 127 \"where he globe\" corrected to \"where the globe\"\r\n  Page 138 \"ceatures to prove\" corrected to \"creatures to prove\"\r\n  Page 216 \"this consellation is\" corrected to \"this constellation is\"\r\n  Page 203 \"Everybirth day\" corrected to \"Every birthday\"",
