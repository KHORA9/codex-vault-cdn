These societies are not only doing much in\r\npopularising the sublimest of the sciences, but are the means of\r\ndeveloping and organising the capabilities of their members by\r\ndiscouraging aimless and desultory observations, and by pointing out how\r\nindividual effort may be utilised and made of permanent value in almost\r\nevery department of astronomy.\r\n\r\nThe work of the astronomer, like that of the votary of almost every other\r\nscience, is becoming every year more and more specialised; and among its\r\nmanifold subdivisions, the study of the physical features of the moon is\r\nundoubtedly increasing in popularity and importance. To those who are\r\npursuing such observations, it is believed that this book will be a\r\nuseful companion to the telescope, and convenient for reference.\r\n\r\nGreat care has been taken in the preparation of the map, which, so far as\r\nthe positions of the various objects represented are concerned, is based\r\non the last edition of Beer and Madler's chart, and on the more recent\r\nand much larger and elaborate map of Schmidt; while as regards the shape\r\nand details of most of the formations, the author's drawings and a large\r\nnumber of photographs have been utilised. Even on so small a scale as\r\neighteen inches to the moon's diameter, more detail might have been\r\ninserted, but this, at the expense of distinctness, would have detracted\r\nfrom the value of the map for handy reference in the usually dim light of\r\nthe observatory, without adding to its utility in other ways. Every named\r\nformation is prominently shown; and most other features of interest,\r\nincluding the principal rill-systems, are represented, though, as regards\r\nthese, no attempt is made to indicate all their manifold details and\r\nramifications, which, to do effectually, would in very many instances\r\nrequire a map on a much larger scale than any that has yet appeared.\r\n\r\nThe insertion of meridian lines and parallels of latitude at every ten\r\ndegrees, and the substitution of names for reference numbers, will add to\r\nthe usefulness of the map.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the text, a large proportion of the objects in the\r\nCatalogue and in the Appendix have been observed and drawn by the author\r\nmany times during the last thirty years, and described in _The\r\nObservatory_ and other publications. He has had, besides, the advantage\r\nof consulting excellent sketches by Mr W.H. MAW, F.R.A.S., Dr. SHELDON,\r\nF.R.A.S., Mr. A. MEE, F.R.A.S., Mr. G.P. HALLOWES, F.R.A.S., Dr. SMART,\r\nF.R.A.S., Mr. T. GORDON, F.R.A.S., Mr. G.T. DAVIS, Herr BRENNER, Herr\r\nKRIEGER, Mr. H. CORDER, and other members of the British Astronomical\r\nAssociation. Through the courtesy of Professor HOLDEN, Director of the\r\nLick Observatory, and M. PRINZ, of the Royal Observatory of Brussels,\r\nmany beautiful photographs and direct photographic enlargements have been\r\navailable, as have also the exquisite heliogravures received by the\r\nauthor from Dr. L. WEINEK, Director of the Imperial Observatory of\r\nPrague, and the admirable examples of the photographic work of MM. PAUL\r\nand PROSPER HENRY of the Paris Observatory, which are occasionally\r\npublished in _Knowledge_. The numerous representations of lunar objects\r\nwhich have appeared from time to time in that storehouse of astronomical\r\ninformation, _The English Mechanic_, and the invaluable notes in\r\n\"Celestial Objects for Common Telescopes,\" and in various periodicals, by\r\nthe late REV. PREBENDARY WEBB, to whom Selenography and Astronomy\r\ngenerally owe so much, have also been consulted.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, all the more prominent and important features are described,\r\nthough very frequently interesting details are referred to which, from\r\ntheir minuteness, could not be shown in the map. The measurements (given\r\nin round numbers) are derived in most instances from NEISON'S (Nevill)\r\n\"Moon,\" though occasionally those in the introduction to Schmidt's chart\r\nare adopted.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS GYWN ELGER.\r\nBEDFORD, 1895.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n  MARIA, OR PLAINS, TERMED \"SEAS\"\r\n  RIDGES\r\n  RING-MOUNTAINS, CRATERS, &C.\r\n    Walled Plains\r\n    Mountain Rings\r\n    Ring-Plains\r\n    Craters\r\n    Crater Cones\r\n    Craterlets, Crater Pits\r\n  MOUNTAIN RANGES, ISOLATED MOUNTAINS, &c.\r\n  CLEFTS, OR RILLS\r\n  FAULTS\r\n  VALLEYS\r\n  BRIGHT RAY-SYSTEMS\r\n  THE MOON'S ALBEDO, SURFACE BRIGHTNESS, &c.\r\n  TEMPERATURE OF THE MOON'S SURFACE\r\n  LUNAR OBSERVATION\r\n  PROGRESS OF SELENOGRAPHY, LUNAR PHOTOGRAPHY\r\n\r\nCATALOGUE OF LUNAR FORMATIONS\r\n  FIRST  QUADRANT--\r\n    West Longitude 90 deg. to 60 deg.\r\n    West Longitude 60 deg. to 40 deg.\r\n    West Longitude 40 deg. to 20 deg.\r\n    West Longitude 20 deg. to  0 deg.\r\n  SECOND QUADRANT--\r\n    East Longitude  0 deg. to 20 deg.\r\n    East Longitude 20 deg. to 40 deg.\r\n    East Longitude 40 deg. to 60 deg.\r\n    East Longitude 60 deg. to 90 deg.\r\n  THIRD  QUADRANT--\r\n    East Longitude  0 deg. to 20 deg.\r\n    East Longitude 20 deg. to 40 deg.\r\n    East Longitude 40 deg. to 60 deg.\r\n    East Longitude 60 deg. to 90 deg.\r\n  FOURTH QUADRANT--\r\n    West Longitude 90 deg. to 60 deg.\r\n    West Longitude 60 deg. to 40 deg.\r\n    West Longitude 40 deg. to 20 deg.\r\n    West Longitude 20 deg. to  0 deg.\r\n\r\nMAP OF THE MOON\r\n  First  Quadrant\r\n  Second Quadrant\r\n  Third  Quadrant\r\n  Fourth Quadrant\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n  Description of Map\r\n  List of the Maria, or Grey Plains, termed \"Seas,\" &c.\r\n  List of some of the most Prominent Mountain Ranges, Promontories,\r\n    Isolated Mountains, and Remarkable Hills\r\n  List of the Principal Ray-Systems, Light-Surrounded Craters, and\r\n    Light Spots\r\n  Position of the Lunar Terminator\r\n  Lunar Elements\r\n  Alphabetical List of Formations\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nWe know, both by tradition and published records, that from the earliest\r\ntimes the faint grey and light spots which diversify the face of our\r\nsatellite excited the wonder and stimulated the curiosity of mankind,\r\ngiving rise to suppositions more or less crude and erroneous as to their\r\nactual nature and significance. It is true that Anaxagoras, five\r\ncenturies before our era, and probably other philosophers preceding him,\r\n--certainly Plutarch at a much later date--taught that these delicate\r\nmarkings and differences of tint, obvious to every one with normal\r\nvision, point to the existence of hills and valleys on her surface; the\r\nlatter maintaining that the irregularities of outline presented by the\r\n\"terminator,\" or line of demarcation between the illumined and\r\nunillumined portion of her spherical superficies, are due to mountains\r\nand their shadows; but more than fifteen centuries elapsed before the\r\ntruth of this sagacious conjecture was unquestionably demonstrated.\r\nSelenography, as a branch of observational astronomy, dates from the\r\nspring of 1609, when Galileo directed his \"optic tube\" to the moon, and\r\nin the following year, in the _Sidereus Nuncius_, or \"the Intelligencer\r\nof the Stars,\" gave to an astonished and incredulous world an account of\r\nthe unsuspected marvels it revealed. In this remarkable little book we\r\nhave the first attempt to represent the telescopic aspect of the moon's\r\nvisible surface in the five rude woodcuts representing the curious\r\nfeatures he perceived thereon, whose form and arrangement, he tells us,\r\nreminded him of the \"ocelli\" on the feathers of a peacock's tail,--a\r\nquaint but not altogether inappropriate simile to describe the appearance\r\nof groups of the larger ring-mountains partially illuminated by the sun,\r\nwhen seen in a small telescope.\r\n\r\nThe bright and dusky areas, so obvious to the unaided sight, were found\r\nby Galileo to be due to a very manifest difference in the character of\r\nthe lunar surface, a large portion of the northern hemisphere, and no\r\ninconsiderable part of the south-eastern quadrant, being seen to consist\r\nof large grey monotonous tracts, often bordered by lofty mountains, while\r\nthe remainder of the superficies was much more conspicuously brilliant,\r\nand, moreover, included by far the greater number of those curious ring-\r\nmountains and other extraordinary features whose remarkable aspect and\r\npeculiar arrangement first attracted his attention. Struck by the analogy\r\nwhich these contrasted regions present to the land and water surfaces of\r\nour globe, he suspected that the former are represented on the moon by\r\nthe brighter and more rugged, and the latter by the smoother and more\r\nlevel areas; a view, however, which Kepler more distinctly formulated in\r\nthe dictum, \"Do maculas esse Maria, do lucidas esse terras.\" Besides\r\nmaking a rude lunar chart, he estimated the heights of some of the ring-\r\nmountains by measuring the distance from the terminator of their bright\r\nsummit peaks, when they were either coming into or passing out of\r\nsunlight; and though his method was incapable of accuracy, and his\r\nresults consequently untrustworthy, it served to demonstrate the immense\r\naltitude of these circumvallations, and to show how greatly they exceed\r\nany mountains on the earth if the relative dimensions of the two globes\r\nare taken into consideration.\r\n\r\nBefore the close of the century when selenography first became possible,\r\nHevel of Dantzig, Scheiner, Langrenus (cosmographer to the King of\r\nSpain), Riccioli, the Jesuit astronomer of Bologna, and Dominic Cassini,\r\nthe celebrated French astronomer, greatly extended the knowledge of the\r\nmoon's surface, and published drawings of various phases, and charts,\r\nwhich, though very rude and incomplete, were a clear advance upon what\r\nGalileo, with his inferior optical means, had been able to accomplish.\r\nLangrenus, and after him Hevel, gave distinctive names to the various\r\nformations, mainly derived from terrestrial physical features, for which\r\nRiccioli subsequently substituted those of philosophers, mathematicians,\r\nand other celebrities; and Cassini determined by actual measurement the\r\nrelative position of many of the principal objects on the disc, thus\r\nlaying the foundation of an accurate system of lunar topography; while\r\nthe labours of T. Mayer and Schroter in the last century, and of\r\nLohrmann, Madler, Neison (Nevill), Schmidt, and other observers in the\r\npresent, have been mainly devoted to the study of the minuter detail of\r\nthe moon and its physical characteristics.\r\n\r\nAs was manifest to the earliest telescopic observers, its visible surface\r\nis clearly divisible into strongly contrasted areas, differing both in\r\ncolour and structural character. Somewhat less than half of what we see\r\nof it consists of comparatively level dark tracts, some of them very many\r\nthousands of square miles in extent, the monotony of whose dusky\r\nsuperficies is often unrelieved for great distances by any prominent\r\nobject; while the remainder, everywhere manifestly brighter, is not only\r\nmore rugged and uneven, but is covered to a much greater extent with\r\nnumbers of quasi-circular formations, differing widely in size, classed\r\nas walled-plains, ring-plains, craters, craterlets, crater-cones, &c.\r\n(the latter bearing a great outward resemblance to some terrestrial\r\nvolcanoes), and mountain ranges of vast proportions, isolated hills, and\r\nother features.\r\n\r\nThough nothing resembling sheets of water, either of small or large\r\nextent, have ever been detected on the surface, the superficial\r\nresemblance, in small telescopes, of the large grey tracts to the\r\nappearance which we may suppose our terrestrial lakes and oceans would\r\npresent to an observer on the moon, naturally induced the early\r\nselenographers to term them Maria, or \"seas\"--a convenient name, which\r\nis still maintained, without, however, implying that these areas, as we\r\nnow see them, are, or ever were, covered with water. Some, however,\r\nregard them as old sea-beds, from which every trace of fluid, owing to\r\nsome unknown cause, has vanished, and that the folds and wrinkles, the\r\nridges, swellings, and other peculiarities of structure observed upon\r\nthem, represent some of the results of alluvial action. It is, of course,\r\npossible, and even probable, that at a remote epoch in the evolution of\r\nour satellite these lower regions were occupied by water, but that their\r\nsurface, as it now appears, is actually this old sea-bottom, seems to be\r\nless likely than that it represents the consolidated crust of some semi-\r\nfluid or viscous material (possibly of a basaltic type) which has welled\r\nforth from orifices or rents communicating with the interior, and\r\noverspread and partially filled up these immense hollows, more or less\r\noverwhelming and destroying many formations which stood upon them before\r\nthis catastrophe took place. Though this, like many other speculations of\r\na similar character relating to lunar \"geology,\" must remain, at least\r\nfor the present, as a mere hypothesis; indications of this partial\r\ndestruction by some agency or other is almost everywhere apparent in\r\nthose formations which border the so-called seas, as, for example,\r\nFracastorius in the Mare Nectaris; Le Monnier in the Mare Serenitatis;\r\nPitatus and Hesiodus, on the south side of the Mare Nubium; Doppelmayer\r\nin the Mare Humorum, and in many other situations; while no observer can\r\nfail to notice innumerable instances of more or less complete\r\nobliteration and ruin among objects within these areas, in the form of\r\nobscure rings (mere scars on the surface), dusky craters, circular\r\narrangements of isolated hills, reminding one of the monoliths of a\r\nDruidical temple; all of which we are justified in concluding were at one\r\ntime formations of a normal type. It has been held by some selenologists\r\n--and Schmidt appears to be of the number,--that, seeing the comparative\r\nscarcity of large ring-plains and other massive formations on the Maria,\r\nthese grey plains represent, as it were, a picture of the primitive\r\nsurface of the moon before it was disturbed by the operations of interior\r\nforces; but this view affords no explanation of the undoubted existence\r\nof the relics of an earlier lunar world beneath their smooth superficies.\r\n\r\nMARIA.--Leaving, however, these considerations for a more particular\r\ndescription of the Maria, it is clearly impossible, in referring to their\r\nlevel relatively to the higher and brighter land surface of the moon, to\r\nappeal to any hypsometrical standard. All that is known in this respect\r\nis, that they are invariably lower than the latter, and that some sink to\r\na greater depth than others, or, in other words, that they do not all\r\nform a part of the same sphere. Though they are more or less of a\r\ngreyish-slaty hue--some of them approximating very closely to that of the\r\npigment known as \"Payne's grey\"--the tone, of course, depends upon the\r\nangle at which the solar rays impinge on that particular portion of the\r\nsurface under observation. Speaking generally, they are, as would follow\r\nfrom optical considerations, conspicuously darker when viewed near the\r\nterminator, or when the sun is either rising or setting upon them, than\r\nunder a more vertical angle of illumination. But even when it is possible\r\nto compare their colour by eye-estimation under similar solar altitudes,\r\nit is found that not only are some of the Maria, as a whole, notably\r\ndarker than others, but nearly all of them exhibit _local_ inequalities\r\nof hue, which, under good atmospheric and instrumental conditions, are\r\nespecially remarkable. Under such circumstances I have frequently seen\r\nthe surface, in many places covered with minute glittering points of\r\nlight, shining with a silvery lustre, intermingled with darker spots and\r\na network of streaks far too delicate and ethereal to represent in a\r\ndrawing. In addition to these contrasts and differences in the sombre\r\ntone of these extended plains, many observers have remarked traces of a\r\nyellow or green tint on the surface of some of them. For example, the\r\nMare Imbrium and the Mare Frigoris appear under certain conditions to be\r\nof a dirty yellow-green hue, the central parts of the Mare Humorum dusky\r\ngreen, and part of the Mare Serenitatis and the Mare Crisium light green,\r\nwhile the Palus Somnii has been noted a golden-brown yellow. To these may\r\nbe added the district round Taruntius in the Mare Foecunditatis, and\r\nportions of other regions referred to in the catalogue, where I have\r\nremarked a very decided sepia colour under a low sun. It has been\r\nattempted to account for these phenomena by supposing the existence of\r\nsome kind of vegetation; but as this involves the presence of an\r\natmosphere, the idea hardly finds favour at the present time, though\r\nperhaps the possibility of plant growth in the low-lying districts, where\r\na gaseous medium may prevail, is not altogether so chimerical a notion as\r\nto be unworthy of consideration. Nasmyth and others suggest that these\r\ntints may be due to broad expanses of coloured volcanic material, an\r\nhypothesis which, if we believe the Maria to be overspread with such\r\nmatter, and knowing how it varies in colour in terrestrial volcanic\r\nregions, is more probable than the first. Anyway, whether we consider\r\nthese appearances to be objective, or, after all, only due to purely\r\nphysiological causes, they undoubtedly merit closer study and\r\ninvestigation than they have hitherto received.\r\n\r\nThere are twenty-three of these dusky areas which have received\r\ndistinctive names; seventeen of them are wholly, or in great part,\r\nconfined to the northern, and to the south-eastern quarter of the\r\nsouthern hemisphere--the south-western quadrant being to a great extent\r\ndevoid of them. By far the largest is the vast Oceanus Procellarum,\r\nextending from a high northern latitude to beyond latitude 10 deg. in the\r\nsouth-eastern quadrant, and, according to Schmidt, with its bays and\r\ninflections, occupying an area of nearly two million square miles, or\r\nmore than that of all the remaining Maria put together. Next in order of\r\nsize come the Mare Nubium, of about one-fifth the superficies, covering a\r\nlarge portion of the south-eastern quadrant, and extending considerably\r\nnorth of the equator, and the Mare Imbrium, wholly confined to the\r\nnortheastern quadrant, and including an area of about 340,000 square\r\nmiles. These are by far the largest lunar \"seas.\" The Mare Foecunditatis,\r\nin the western hemisphere, the greater part of it lying in the south-\r\nwestern quadrant, is scarcely half so big as the Mare Imbrium; while the\r\nMaria Serenitatis and Tranquilitatis, about equal in area (the former\r\nsituated wholly north of the equator, and the latter only partially\r\nextending south of it), are still smaller. The arctic Mare Frigoris, some\r\n100,000 square miles in extent, is the only remaining large sea,--the\r\nrest, such as the Mare Vaporum, the Sinus Medii, the Mare Crisium, the\r\nMare Humorum, and the Mare Humboldtianum, are of comparatively small\r\ndimensions, the Mare Crisium not greatly exceeding 70,000 square miles,\r\nthe Mare Humorum (about the size of England) 50,000 square miles, while\r\nthe Mare Humboldtianum, according to Schmidt, includes only about 42,000\r\nsquare miles, an area which is approached by some formations not classed\r\nwith the Maria. This distinction, speaking generally, prevails among the\r\nMaria,--those of larger size, such as the Oceanus Procellarum, the Mare\r\nNubium, and the Mare Foecunditatis, are less definitely enclosed, and,\r\nlike terrestrial oceans, communicate with one another; while their\r\nborders, or, if the term may be allowed, their coast-line, is often\r\ncomparatively low and ill-defined, exhibiting many inlets and\r\nirregularities in outline. Others, again, of considerable area, as, for\r\nexample, the Mare Serenitatis and the Mare Imbrium, are bounded more or\r\nless completely by curved borders, consisting of towering mountain\r\nranges, descending with a very steep escarpment to their surface: thus in\r\nform and other characteristics they resemble immense wall-surrounded\r\nplains. Among the best examples of enclosed Maria is the Mare Crisium,\r\nwhich is considered by Neison to be the deepest of all, and the Mare\r\nHumboldtianum.\r\n\r\nThough these great plains are described as level, this term must only be\r\ntaken in a comparative sense. No one who observes them when their surface\r\nis thrown into relief by the oblique rays of the rising or setting sun\r\ncan fail to remark many low bubble-shaped swellings with gently rounded\r\noutlines, shallow trough-like hollows, and, in the majority of them, long\r\nsinuous ridges, either running concentrically with their borders or\r\ntraversing them from side to side. Though none of these features are of\r\nany great altitude or depth, some of the ridges are as much as 700 feet\r\nin height, and probably in many instances the other elevations often rise\r\nto 150 feet or more above the low-lying parts of the plains on which they\r\nstand. Hence we may say that the Maria are only level in the sense that\r\nmany districts in the English Midland counties are level, and not that\r\ntheir surface is absolutely flat. The same may be said as to their\r\napparent smoothness, which, as is evident when they are viewed close to\r\nthe terminator, is an expression needing qualification, for under these\r\nconditions they often appear to be covered with wrinkles, flexures, and\r\nlittle asperities, which, to be visible at all, must be of considerable\r\nsize. In fact, were it possible to examine them from a distance of a few\r\nmiles, instead of from a standpoint which, under the most favourable\r\ncircumstances, cannot be reckoned at less than 300, and this through an\r\ninterposed aerial medium always more or less perturbed, they would\r\nprobably be described as rugged and uneven, as some modern lava sheets.\r\n\r\nRIDGES.--Among the Maria which exhibit the most remarkable arrangement of\r\nridges is the Mare Humorum, in the south-eastern quadrant. Here, if it be\r\nobserved under a rising sun, a number of these objects will be seen\r\nextending from the region north of the ring-mountain Vitello in long\r\nundulating lines, roughly concentric with the western border of the\r\n\"sea,\" and gradually diminishing in altitude as they spread out, with\r\nmany ramifications, to a distance of 200 miles or more towards the north.\r\nAt this stage of illumination they are strikingly beautiful in a good\r\ntelescope, reminding one of the ripple-marks left by the tide on a soft\r\nsandy beach. Like most other objects of their class, they are very\r\nevanescent, gradually disappearing as the sun rises higher in the lunar\r\nfirmament, and ultimately leaving nothing to indicate their presence\r\nbeyond here and there a ghostly streak or vein of a somewhat lighter hue\r\nthan that of the neighbouring surface. The Mare Nectaris, again, in the\r\nsouth-western quadrant, presents some fine examples of concentric ridges,\r\nwhich are seen to the best advantage when the morning sun is rising on\r\nRosse, a prominent crater north of Fracastorius. This \"sea\" is evidently\r\nconcave in cross-section, the central portion being considerably lower\r\nthan the margin, and these ridges appear to mark the successive stages of\r\nthe change of level from the coast-line to the centre. They suggest the\r\n\"caving in\" of the surface, similar to that observed on a frozen pond or\r\nriver, where the \"cat's ice\" at the edge, through the sinking of the\r\nwater beneath, is rent and tilted to a greater or less degree. The Mare\r\nSerenitatis and the Mare Imbrium, in the northern hemisphere, are also\r\nremarkable for the number of these peculiar features. They are very\r\nplentifully distributed round the margin and in other parts of the\r\nformer, which includes besides one of the longest and loftiest on the\r\nmoon's visible surface--the great serpentine ridge, first drawn and\r\ndescribed nearly a hundred years ago by the famous selenographer,\r\nSchroter of Lilienthal. Originating at a little crater under the north-\r\neast wall of great ring-plain Posidonius, it follows a winding course\r\nacross the Mare toward the south, throwing out many minor branches, and\r\nultimately dies out under a great rocky promontory--the Promontory\r\nAcherusia, at the western termination of the Haemus range. A\r\ncomparatively low power serves to show the curious structural character\r\nof this immense ridge, which appears to consist of a number of\r\ncorrugations and folds massed together, rising in places, according to\r\nNeison, to a height of 700 feet and more. The Mare Imbrium also affords\r\nan example of a ridge, which, though shorter, is nearly as prominent, in\r\nthat which runs from the bright little ring-plain Piazzi Smyth towards\r\nthe west side of Plato. The region round Timocharis and other quarters of\r\nthe Mare are likewise traversed by very noteworthy features of a similar\r\nclass. The Oceanus Procellarum also presents good instances of ridges in\r\nthe marvellous ramifications round Encke, Kepler, and Marius, and in the\r\nregion north of Aristarchus and Herodotus. Perhaps the most perfect\r\nexamples of surface swellings are those in the Mare Tranquilitatis, a\r\nlittle east of the ring-plain Arago, where there are two nearly equal\r\ncircular mounds, at least ten miles in diameter, resembling tumuli seen\r\nfrom above. Similar, but more irregular, objects of a like kind are very\r\nplentiful in many other quarters.\r\n\r\nIt is a suggestive peculiarity of many of the lunar ridges, both on the\r\nMaria and elsewhere, that they are very generally found in association\r\nwith craters of every size. Illustrations of this fact occur almost\r\neverywhere. Frequently small craters are found on the summits of these\r\nelevations, but more often on their flanks and near their base. Where a\r\nridge suddenly changes its direction, a crater of some prominence\r\ngenerally marks the point, often forming a node, or crossing-place of\r\nother ridges, which thus appear to radiate from it as a centre. Sometimes\r\nthey intrude within the smaller ring-mountains, passing through gaps in\r\ntheir walls as, for example, in the cases of Madler, Lassell, &c. Various\r\nhypotheses have been advanced to account for them. The late Professor\r\nPhillips, the geologist, who devoted much attention to the telescopic\r\nexamination of the physical features of the moon, compared the lunar\r\nridges to long, low, undulating mounds, of somewhat doubtful origin,\r\ncalled \"kames\" in Scotland, and \"eskers\" in Ireland, where on the low\r\ncentral plain they are commonly found in the form of extended banks\r\n(mainly of gravel), with more or less steep sides, rising to heights of\r\nfrom 20 to 70 feet. They are sometimes only a few yards wide at the top,\r\nwhile in other places they spread out into large humps, having circular\r\nor oval cavities on their summits, 50 or 60 yards across, and as much as\r\n40 feet deep. Like the lunar ridges, they throw out branches and exhibit\r\nmany breaches of continuity. By some geologists they are supposed to\r\nrepresent old submarine banks formed by tidal currents, like harbour\r\nbars, and by others to be glacial deposits; in either case, to be either\r\ndirectly or indirectly due to alluvial action. Their outward resemblance\r\nto some of the ridges on the moon is unquestionable; and if we could\r\nbelieve that the Maria, as we now see them, are dried-up sea-beds, it\r\nmight be concluded that these ridges had a similar origin; but their\r\nclose connection with centres of volcanic disturbance, and the numbers of\r\nlittle craters on or near their track, point to the supposition that they\r\nconsist rather of material exuded from long-extending fissures in the\r\ncrust of the \"seas,\" and in other surfaces where they are superimposed.\r\nThis conjecture is rendered still more probable by the fact that we\r\nsometimes find the direction of clefts (which are undoubted surface\r\ncracks) prolonged in the form of long narrow ridges or of rows of little\r\nhillocks. We are, however, not bound to assume that all the manifold\r\ncorrugations observed on the lunar plains are due to one and the same\r\ncause; indeed, it is clear that some are merely the outward indications\r\nof sudden drops in the surface, as in the case of the ridges round the\r\nwestern margin of the Mare Nectaris, and in other situations, where\r\nsubsidence is manifested by features assuming the outward aspect of\r\nordinary ridges, but which are in reality of a very different structural\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nThe Maria, like almost every other part of the visible surface, abound in\r\ncraters of a minute type, which are scattered here and there without any\r\napparent law or ascertained principle of arrangement. Seeing how\r\nimperfect is our acquaintance with even the larger objects of this class,\r\nit is rash to insist on the antiquity or permanence of such diminutive\r\nobjects, or to dogmatise about the cessation of lunar activity in\r\nconnection with features where the volcanic history of our globe, if it\r\nis of any value as an analogue, teaches us it is most likely to prevail.\r\n\r\nMost observers will agree with Schmidt, that observations and drawings of\r\nobjects on the sombre depressed plains of the moon are easier and\r\npleasanter to make than on the dazzling highlands, and that the lunar\r\n\"sea\" is to the working selenographer like an oasis in the desert to the\r\ntraveller--a relief in this case, however, not to an exhausted body, but\r\nto a weary eye.\r\n\r\nRING-MOUNTAINS, CRATERS, &C.--It is these objects, in their almost\r\nendless variety and bewildering number, which, more than any others, give\r\nto our satellite that marvellous appearance in the telescope which since\r\nthe days of Galileo has never failed to evoke the astonishment of the\r\nbeholder. However familiar we may be with the lunar surface, we can never\r\ngaze on these extraordinary formations, whether massed together\r\napparently in inextricable confusion, or standing in isolated grandeur,\r\nlike Copernicus, on the grey surface of the plains, without experiencing,\r\nin a scarcely diminished degree, the same sensation of wonder and\r\nadmiration with which they were beheld for the first time. Although the\r\nattempt to bring all these _bizarre_ forms under a rigid scheme of\r\nclassification has not been wholly successful, their structural\r\npeculiarities, the hypsometrical relation between their interior and the\r\nsurrounding district, their size, and the character of their\r\ncircumvallation, the dimensions of their cavernous opening as compared\r\nwith that of the more or less truncated conical mass of matter\r\nsurrounding it, all afford a basis for grouping them under distinctive\r\ntitles, that are not only convenient to the selenographer, but which\r\nundoubtedly represent, as a rule, actual diversities in their origin and\r\nphysical character.\r\n\r\nThese distinguishing titles, as adopted by Schroter, Lohrmann, and\r\nMadler, and accepted by subsequent observers, are WALLED-PLAINS, MOUNTAIN\r\nRINGS, RING-PLAINS, CRATERS, CRATER-CONES, CRATERLETS, CRATER-PITS,\r\nDEPRESSIONS.\r\n\r\nWALLED-PLAINS.--These formations, approximating more or less to the\r\ncircular form, though frequently deviating considerably from it, are\r\namong the largest enclosures on the moon. They vary from upwards of 150\r\nto 60 miles or under in diameter, and are often encircled by a complex\r\nrampart of considerable breadth, rising in some instances to a height of\r\n12,000 feet or more above the enclosed plain. This rampart is rarely\r\ncontinuous, but is generally interrupted by gaps, crossed by transverse\r\nvalleys and passes, and broken by more recent craters and depressions. As\r\na rule, the area within the circumvallation (usually termed \"the floor\")\r\nis only slightly, if at all, lower than the region outside: it is very\r\ngenerally of a dusky hue, similar to that of the grey plains or Maria,\r\nand, like them, is usually variegated by the presence of hills, ridges,\r\nand craters, and is sometimes traversed by delicate furrows, termed\r\nclefts or rills.\r\n\r\n_Ptolemaeus_, in the third quadrant, and not far removed from the centre\r\nof the disc, may be taken as a typical example of the class. Here we have\r\na vast plain, 115 miles from side to side, encircled by a massive but\r\nmuch broken wall, which at one peak towers more than 9000 feet above a\r\nlevel floor, which includes details of a very remarkable character. The\r\nadjoining _Alphonsus_ is another, but somewhat smaller, object of the\r\nsame type, as are also _Albategnius_, and _Arzachel_; and _Plato_, in a\r\nhigh northern latitude, with its noble many-peaked rampart and its\r\nvariable steel-grey interior. _Grimaldi_, near the eastern limb (perhaps\r\nthe darkest area on the moon), _Schickard_, nearly as big, on the south-\r\neastern limb, and _Bailly_, larger than either (still farther south in\r\nthe same quadrant), although they approach some of the smaller \"seas\" in\r\nsize, are placed in the same category. The conspicuous central mountain,\r\nso frequently associated with other types of ringed enclosures, is by no\r\nmeans invariably found within the walled-plains; though, as in the case\r\nof _Petavius_, _Langrenus_, _Gassendi_, and several other noteworthy\r\nexamples, it is very prominently displayed. The progress of sunrise on\r\nall these objects affords a magnificent spectacle. Very often when the\r\nrays impinge on their apparently level floor at an angle of from 1 deg.\r\nto 2 deg., it is seen to be coarse, rough grained, and covered with\r\nminute elevations, although an hour or so afterwards it appears as smooth\r\nas glass.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is a distinguishing characteristic that there is no great\r\ndifference in level between the outside and the inside of a walled-plain,\r\nthere are some very interesting exceptions to this rule, which are termed\r\nby Schmidt \"Transitional forms.\" Among these he places some of the most\r\ncolossal formations, such as _Clavius_, _Maurolycus_, _Stofler_,\r\n_Janssen_, and _Longomontanus_. The first, which may be taken as\r\nrepresentative of the class (well known to observers as one of the\r\ngrandest of lunar objects), has a deeply sunken floor, fringed with\r\nmountains rising some 12,000 feet above it, though they scarcely stand a\r\nfourth of this height above the plain on the west, which ascends with a\r\nvery gentle gradient to the summit of the wall. Hence the contrast\r\nbetween the shadows of the peaks of the western wall on the floor at\r\nsunrise, and of the same peaks on the region west of the border at sunset\r\nis very marked. In _Gassendi_, _Phocylides_, and _Wargentin_ we have\r\nsimilar notable departures from the normal type. The floor of the former\r\non the north stands 2000 feet _above_ the Mare Humorum. In _Phocylides_,\r\nprobably through \"faulting,\" one portion of the interior suddenly sinks\r\nto a considerable depth below the remainder; while the very abnormal\r\n_Wargentin_ has such an elevated floor, that, when viewed under\r\nfavourable conditions, it reminds one of a shallow oval tray or dish\r\nfilled with fluid to the point of overflowing. These examples, very far\r\nfrom being exhaustive, will be sufficient to show that the walled-plains\r\nexhibit noteworthy differences in other respects than size, height of\r\nrampart, or included detail. Still another peculiarity, confined, it is\r\nbelieved, to a very few, may be mentioned, viz., convexity of floor,\r\nprominently displayed in Petavius, Mersenius, and Hevel.\r\n\r\nMOUNTAIN RINGS.--These objects, usually encircled by a low and broken\r\nborder, seldom more than a few hundred feet in height, are closely allied\r\nto the walled-plains. They are more frequently found on the Maria than\r\nelsewhere. In some cases the ring consists of isolated dark sections,\r\nwith here and there a bright mass of rock interposed; in others, of low\r\ncurvilinear ridges, forming a more or less complete circumvallation. They\r\nvary in size from 60 or 70 miles to 15 miles and less. The great ring\r\nnorth of Flamsteed, 60 miles across, is a notable example; another lies\r\nwest of it on the north of Wichmann; while a third will be found south-\r\neast of Encke;--indeed, the Mare Procellarum abounds in objects of this\r\ntype. The curious formation on the Mare Imbrium immediately south of\r\nPlato (called \"Newton\" by Schroter), may be placed in this category, as\r\nmay also many of the low dusky rings of much smaller dimensions found in\r\nmany quarters of the Maria. As has been stated elsewhere, these features\r\nhave the appearance of having once been formations of a much more\r\nprominent and important character, which have suffered destruction, more\r\nor less complete, through being partially overwhelmed by the material of\r\nthe \"seas.\"\r\n\r\nRING-PLAINS.--These are by far the most numerous of the ramparted\r\nenclosures of the moon, and though it is occasionally difficult to decide\r\nin which class, walled-plain or ring-plain, some objects should be\r\nplaced, yet, as a rule, the difference between the structural character\r\nof the two is abundantly obvious. The ring-plains vary in diameter from\r\nsixty to less than ten miles, and are far more regular in outline than\r\nthe walled-plains. Their ramparts, often very massive, are more\r\ncontinuous, and fall with a steep declivity to a floor almost always\r\ngreatly depressed below the outside region. The inner slopes generally\r\ndisplay subordinate heights, called terraces, arranged more or less\r\nconcentrically, and often extending in successive stages nearly down to\r\nthe interior foot of the wall. With the intervening valleys, these\r\nfeatures are very striking objects when viewed under good conditions with\r\nhigh powers. In some cases they may possibly represent the effects of the\r\nslipping of the upper portions of the wall, from a want of cohesiveness\r\nin the material of which it is composed; but this hardly explains why the\r\nhighest terrace often stands nearly as high as the rampart. Nasmyth, in\r\nhis eruption hypothesis, suggests that in such a case there may have been\r\ntwo eruptions from the same vent; one powerful, which formed the exterior\r\ncircle, and a second, rather less powerful, which has formed the interior\r\ncircle. Ultimately, however, coming to the conclusion that terraces, as a\r\nrule, are not due to any such freaks of the eruption, he ascribes them to\r\nlandslips. In any case, we can hardly imagine that material standing at\r\nsuch a high angle of inclination as that forming the summit ridge of many\r\nof the ring-plains would not frequently slide down in great masses, and\r\nthus form irregular plateaus on the lower and flatter portions of the\r\nslope; but this fails to explain the symmetrical arrangement of the\r\nconcentric terraces and intermediate valleys. The inner declivity of the\r\nnorth-eastern wall of Plato exhibits what to all appearance is an\r\nundoubted landslip, as does also that of Hercules on the northern side,\r\nand numerous other cases might be adduced; but in all of them the\r\nappearance is very different from that of the true terrace.\r\n\r\nThe _glacis_, or outer slope of a ring-plain, is invariably of a much\r\ngentler inclination than that which characterises the inner declivity:\r\nwhile the latter very frequently descends at an angle varying from 60\r\ndeg. to 50 deg. at the crest of the wall, to from 10 deg. to 2 deg. at\r\nthe bottom, where it meets the floor; the former extends for a great\r\ndistance at a very flat gradient before it sinks to the general level of\r\nthe surrounding country. It differs likewise from the inner descent, in\r\nthe fact that, though often traversed by valleys, intersected by deep\r\ngullies and irregular depressions, and covered with humpy excrescences\r\nand craters, it is only rarely that any features comparable to the\r\nterraces, usually present on the inner escarpment, can be traced upon it.\r\n\r\nElongated depressions of irregular outline, and very variable in size and\r\ndepth, are frequently found on the outer slopes of the border. Some of\r\nthem consist of great elliptical or sub-circular cavities, displaying\r\nmany expansions and contractions, called \"pockets,\" and suggesting the\r\nidea that they were originally distinct cup-shaped hollows, which from\r\nsome cause or other have coalesced like rows of inosculating craters.\r\nWhile many of these features are so deep that they remain visible for a\r\nconsiderable time under a low sun, others, though perhaps of greater\r\nextent, vanish in an hour or so.\r\n\r\nAs in the case of the walled-plains, the ramparts of the ring-plains\r\nexhibit gaps and are broken by craters and depressions, but to a much\r\nless extent. Often the lofty crest, surmounted by _aiguilles_ or by\r\nblunter peaks, towering in some cases to nearly double its altitude above\r\nthe interior, is perfectly continuous (like Copernicus), or only\r\ninterrupted by narrow passes. It is a suggestive circumstance that gaps,\r\nother than valleys, are almost invariably found either in the north or\r\nsouth walls, or in both, and seldom in other positions. The buttress, or\r\nlong-extending spur, is a feature frequently associated with the ring-\r\nplain rampart, as are also numbers of what, for the lack of a better\r\nname, must be termed little hillocks, which generally radiate in long\r\nrows from the outer foot of the slope. The spurs usually abut on the\r\nwall, and, either spreading out like the sticks of a fan or running\r\nroughly parallel to each other, extend for long distances, gradually\r\ndiminishing in height and width till they die out on the surrounding\r\nsurface. They have been compared to lava streams, which those round\r\nAristillus, Aristoteles, and on the flank of Clavius _a_, certainly\r\nsomewhat resemble, though, in the two former instances, they are rather\r\ncomparable to immense ridges. In addition to the above, the spurs\r\nradiating from the south-eastern rampart of Condamine and the long\r\nundulating ridges and rows of hillocks running from Cyrillus over the\r\neastern _glacis_ of Theophilus, may be named as very interesting\r\nexamples.\r\n\r\nNeison and some other selenographers place in a distinct class certain of\r\nthe smaller ring-plains which usually have a steeper outer slope, and are\r\nsupposed to present clearer indications of a volcanic origin than the\r\nring-plains, terming them \"Crater-plains.\"\r\n\r\nCRATERS.--Under this generic name is placed a vast number of formations\r\nexhibiting a great difference in size and outward characteristics, though\r\ngenerally (under moderate magnification) of a circular or sub-circular\r\nshape. Their diameter varies from 15 miles or more to 3, and even less,\r\nand their flanks rise much more steeply to the summit, which is seldom\r\nvery lofty, than those of the ring-plains, and fall more gradually to the\r\nfloor. There is no portion of the moon in which they do not abound,\r\nwhether it be on the ramparts, floors, and outer slopes of walled and\r\nring plains, the summits and escarpments of mountain ranges, amid the\r\nintricacies of the highlands, or on the grey surface of the Maria. In\r\nmany instances they have a brighter and newer aspect than the larger\r\nformations, often being the most brilliant points on their walls, when\r\nthey are found in this position. Very frequently too they are not only\r\nvery bright themselves, but stand on bright areas, whose borders are\r\ngenerally concentric with them, which shine with a glistening lustre, and\r\nform a kind of halo of light around them. Euclides and Bessarion A, and\r\nthe craters east of Landsberg, are especially interesting examples. It\r\nseems not improbable that these areas may represent deposits formed by\r\nsome kind of matter ejected from the craters, but whether of ancient or\r\nmodern date, it is, of course, impossible to determine. Future observers\r\nwill perhaps be in a better position to decide the question without\r\ncavil, if such eruptions should again take place. Like the larger\r\nenclosures, these smaller objects frequently encroach upon each other--\r\ncrater-ring overlapping crater-ring, as in the case of Thebit, where a\r\nlarge crater, which has interfered with the continuity of the east wall,\r\nhas, in its turn, been disturbed by a smaller crater on its own east\r\nwall. The craters in many cases, possibly in the majority if we could\r\ndetect them, have central mountains, some of them being excellent tests\r\nfor telescopic definition--as, for example, the central peaks of\r\nHortensius, Bessarion, and that of the small crater just mentioned on the\r\neast wall of Thebit A. A tendency to a linear arrangement is often\r\ndisplayed, especially among the smaller class, as is also their\r\noccurrence in pairs.\r\n\r\nCRATER-CONES.--These objects, plentifully distributed on the lunar\r\nsurface, are especially interesting from their outward resemblance to the\r\nparasitic cones found on the flanks of terrestrial volcanoes (Etna, for\r\ninstance). In the larger examples it is occasionally possible to see that\r\nthe interiors are either inverted cones without a floor, or cup-shaped\r\ndepressions on the summit of the object. Frequently, however, they are so\r\nsmall that the orifice can only be detected under oblique illumination.\r\nUnder a high sun they generally appear as white spots, more or less ill-\r\ndefined, as on the floors of Archimedes, Fracastorius, Plato, and many\r\nother formations, which include a great number, all of which are probably\r\ncrater cones, although only a few have been seen as such. It is a\r\nsignificant fact that in these situations they are always found to be\r\nclosely associated with the light streaks which traverse the interior of\r\nthe formations, standing either on their surface or close to their edges.\r\nThe instrumental and meteorological requirements necessary for a\r\nsuccessful scrutiny of the smallest type of these features, are beyond\r\nthe reach of the ordinary observer in this country, as they demand direct\r\nobservation in large telescopes under the best atmospheric conditions.\r\n\r\nSome years ago Dr. Klein of Cologne called attention to some very\r\ninteresting types of crater-cones, which may be found on certain dark or\r\nsmoky-grey areas on the moon. These, he considers, may probably represent\r\nactive volcanic vents, and urges that they should be diligently examined\r\nand watched by observers who possess telescopes adequate to the task. The\r\nmost noteworthy examples of these objects are in the following\r\npositions:--(1) West of a prominent ridge running from Beaumont to the\r\nwest side of Theophilus, and about midway between these formations; (2)\r\nin the Mare Vaporum, south of Hyginus; (3) on the floor of Werner, near\r\nthe foot of the north wall; (4) under the east wall of Alphonsus, on the\r\ndusky patch in the interior; (5) on the south side of the floor of Atlas.\r\nI have frequently described elsewhere with considerable detail the\r\ntelescopic appearance of these features under various phases, and have\r\npointed out that though large apertures and high powers are needed to see\r\nthese cones to advantage, the dusky areas, easily traced on photograms,\r\nmight be usefully studied by observers with smaller instruments, as if\r\nthey represent the _ejecta_ from the crater-cones which stand upon them,\r\nchanges in their form and extent could very possibly be detected. In\r\naddition to those already referred to, a number of mysterious dark spots\r\nwere discovered by Schmidt in the dusky region about midway between\r\nCopernicus and Gambart, which Klein describes as perforated like a sieve\r\nwith minute craters. A short distance south-west of Copernicus stands a\r\nbright crater-cone surrounded by a grey nimbus, which may be classed with\r\nthese objects. It is well seen under a high light, as indeed is the case\r\nwith most of these features.\r\n\r\nCRATERLETS, CRATER-PITS.--To a great extent the former term is needless\r\nand misleading, as the so-called craters merge by imperceptible\r\ngradations into very minute objects, as small as half a mile in diameter,\r\nand most probably, if we could more accurately estimate their size, still\r\nless. The crater-pit, however, has well-marked peculiarities which\r\ndistinguish it from all other types, such as the absence of a\r\ndistinguishable rim and extreme shallowness. They appear to be most\r\nnumerous on the high-level plains and plateaus in the south-western\r\nquadrant, and may be counted by hundreds under good atmospheric\r\nconditions on the outer slopes of Walter, Clavius, and other large\r\nenclosures. In these positions they are often so closely aggregated that,\r\nas Nasmyth remarks, they remind one of an accumulation of froth. Even in\r\nan 8 1/2 inch reflector I have frequently seen the outer slope of the\r\nlarge ring-plain on the north-western side of Vendelinus, so perforated\r\nwith these objects that it resembled pumice or vesicular lava, many of\r\nthe little holes being evidently not circular, but square shaped and very\r\nirregular. The interior of Stadius and the region outside abounds in\r\nthese minute features, but the well-known crater-row between this\r\nformation and Copernicus seems rather to consist of a number of\r\ninosculating crater-cones, as they stand very evidently on a raised bank\r\nof some altitude.\r\n\r\nMOUNTAIN RANGES, ISOLATED MOUNTAINS, &c.--The more massive and extended\r\nmountain ranges of the moon are found in the northern hemisphere, and\r\n(what is significant) in that portion of it which exhibits few\r\nindications of other superficial disturbances. The most prominently\r\ndeveloped systems, the _Alps_, the _Caucasus_, and the _Apennines_,\r\nforming a mighty western rampart to the Mare Imbrium and giving it all\r\nthe appearance of a vast walled plain, present few points of resemblance\r\nto any terrestrial chain. The former include many hundred peaks, among\r\nwhich, Mont Blanc rises to a height of 12,000 feet, and a second, some\r\ndistance west of Plato, to nearly as great an altitude; while others,\r\nranging from 5000 to 8000 feet, are common. They extend in a south-west\r\ndirection from Plato to the Caucasus, terminating somewhat abruptly, a\r\nlittle west of the central meridian, in about N. lat. 42 deg. One of the\r\nmost interesting features associated with this range is the so-called\r\ngreat Alpine valley, which cuts through it west of Plato. The _Caucasus_\r\nconsist of a massive wedge-shaped mountain land, projecting southwards,\r\nand partially dividing the Mare Imbrium from the Mare Serenitatis, both\r\nof which they flank. Though without peaks so lofty as those pertaining to\r\nthe Alps, there is one, immediately east of the ring-plain Calippus,\r\nwhich, towering to 19,000 feet, surpasses any of which the latter system\r\ncan boast. The _Apennines_, however, are by far the most magnificent\r\nrange on the visible surface, including as they do some 3000 peaks, and\r\nextending in an almost continuous curve of more than 400 miles in length\r\nfrom Mount Hadley, on the north, to the fine ring-plain Eratosthenes,\r\nwhich forms a fitting termination, on the south. The great headland Mount\r\nHadley rises more than 15,000 feet, while a neighbouring promontory on\r\nthe south-east of it is fully 14,000 feet, and another, close by, is\r\nstill higher above the Mare. Mount Huygens, again, in N. lat. 20 deg.,\r\nand the square-shaped mass Mount Wolf, near the southern end of the\r\nchain, include peaks standing 18,000 and 12,000 feet respectively above\r\nthe plain, to which their flanks descend with a steep declivity. The\r\ncounterscarp of the Apennines, in places 160 miles in width from east to\r\nwest, runs down to the Mare Vaporum with a comparatively gentle\r\ninclination. It is everywhere traversed by winding valleys of a very\r\nintricate type, all trending towards the south-west, and includes some\r\nbright craters and mountain-rings. The _Carpathians_, forming in part the\r\nsouthern border of the Mare Imbrium, extend for a length of more than 180\r\nmiles eastward of E., long. 16 deg., and, embracing the ring-plain Gay-\r\nLussac, terminate west of Mayer. They present a less definite front to\r\nthe Mare than the Apennines, and are broken up and divided by irregular\r\nvalleys and gaps; their loftiest peak, situated on a very projecting\r\npromontory north-west of Mayer, rising to a height of 7000 feet.\r\nNotwithstanding their comparatively low altitude, the region they occupy\r\nforms a fine telescopic picture at lunar sunrise. The _Sinus Iridum\r\nhighlands_, bordering the beautiful bay on the north-east side of the\r\nMare Imbrium, rank among the loftiest and most intricate systems on the\r\nmoon, and, like the Apennines, present a steep face to the grey plain\r\nfrom which they rise, though differing from them in other respects. They\r\ninclude many high peaks, the loftiest, in the neighbourhood of the ring-\r\nplain Sharp, rising 15,000 feet. There are probably some still higher\r\nmountains in the vicinity, but the difficulties attending their\r\nmeasurement render it impossible to determine their altitude with any\r\napproach to accuracy.\r\n\r\n_The Taurus Mountains_ extend from the west side of the Mare Serenitatis,\r\nnear Le Monnier and Littrow, in a north-westerly direction towards\r\nGeminus and Berselius, bordering the west side of the Lacus Somniorum.\r\nThey are a far less remarkable system than any of the preceding, and\r\nconsist rather of a wild irregular mountain region than a range. In the\r\nneighbourhood of Berselius are some peaks which, according to Neison,\r\ncannot be less than 10,000 feet in height.\r\n\r\nOn the north side of the Mare Imbrium, east of Plato, there is a\r\nbeautiful narrow range of bright outlying heights, called the _Teneriffe\r\nMountains_, which include many isolated objects of considerable altitude,\r\none of the loftiest rising about 8000 feet. Farther towards the east lies\r\nanother group of a very similar character, called the _Straight Range_,\r\nfrom its linear regularity. It extends from west to east for a distance\r\nof about 60 miles, being a few miles shorter than the last, and includes\r\na peak of 6000 feet.\r\n\r\n_The Harbinger Mountains_.--A remarkable group, north-west of\r\nAristarchus, including some peaks as high as 7000 feet, and other details\r\nnoticed in the catalogue.\r\n\r\nThe above comprise all the mountain ranges in the northern hemisphere of\r\nany prominence, or which have received distinctive names, except the\r\n_Hercynian Mountains_, on the north-east limb, east of the walled plain\r\nOtto Struve. These are too near the edge to be well observed, but, from\r\nwhat can be seen of them, they appear to abound in lofty peaks, and to\r\nbear more resemblance to a terrestrial chain than any which have yet been\r\nreferred to.\r\n\r\nThe mountain systems of the southern hemisphere, except the ranges\r\nvisible on the limb, are far less imposing and remarkable than those just\r\ndescribed. The _Pyrenees_, on the western side of the Mare Nectaris,\r\nextend in a meridional direction for nearly 190 miles, and include a peak\r\neast of Guttemberg of nearly 12,000 feet, and are traversed in many\r\nplaces by fine valleys.\r\n\r\n_The Altai Mountains_ form a magnificent chain, 275 miles in length,\r\ncommencing on the outer eastern slope of Piccolomini, and following a\r\ntolerably direct north-east course, with a few minor bendings, to the\r\nwest side of Fermat, where they turn more towards the north, ultimately\r\nterminating about midway between Tacitus and Catherina. The region\r\nsituated on the south-east is a great table-land, without any prominent\r\nfeatures, rising gently towards the mountains, which shelve steeply down\r\nto an equally barren expanse on the north-west, to which they present a\r\nlofty face, having an average altitude of about 6000 feet. The loftiest\r\npeak, over 13,000 feet, rises west of Fermat.\r\n\r\n_The Riphaean Mountains_, a remarkably bright group, occupying an\r\nisolated position in the Mare Procellarum south of Landsberg, and\r\nextending for more than 100 miles in a meridional direction. They are\r\nmost closely aggregated at a point nearly due west of Euclides, from\r\nwhich they throw off long-branching arms to the north and south, those on\r\nthe north bifurcating and gradually sinking to the level of the plain.\r\nThe loftiest peaks are near the extremity of this section, one of them\r\nrising to 3000 feet. Two bright craters are associated with these\r\nmountains, one nearly central, and the other south of it.\r\n\r\n_The Percy Mountains_.--This name is given to the bright highlands\r\nextending east of Gassendi towards Mersenius, forming the north-eastern\r\nborder of the Mare Humorum. They abound in minute detail--bright little\r\nmountains and ridges--and include some clefts pertaining to the Mersenius\r\nrill-system; but their most noteworthy feature is the long bright\r\nmountain-arm, branching out from the eastern wall of Gassendi, and\r\nextending for more than 50 miles towards the south-east.\r\n\r\nThe principal ranges on the limb are the _Leibnitz Mountains_, extending\r\nfrom S. lat. 70 deg. on the west to S. lat. 80 deg. on the east limb.\r\nThey include some giant peaks and plateaus, noteworthy objects in\r\nprofile, some of which, according to Schroter and Madler, rise to 26,000\r\nfeet. The _Dorfel Mountains_, between S. lat. 80 deg. and 57 deg. on the\r\neastern limb, include, if Schroter's estimate is correct, three peaks\r\nwhich exceed 26,000 feet. On the eastern limb, between S. lat. 35 deg.\r\nand 18 deg., extend the _Rook Mountains_, which have peaks, according to\r\nSchroter, as high as 25,000 feet. Next in order come the _Cordilleras_,\r\nwhich extend to S. lat. 8 deg., and the _D'Alembert Mountains_, lying\r\neast of Rocca and Grimaldi, closely associated with them, and probably\r\npart of the same system. Some of the peaks approach 20,000 feet. In\r\naddition to these mountain ranges there are others less prominent on the\r\nlimb in the northern hemisphere, which have not been named.\r\n\r\nISOLATED MOUNTAINS are very numerous in different parts of the moon, the\r\nmost remarkable are referred to in the appendix. Many remain unnamed.\r\n\r\nCLEFTS OR RILLS.--Though Fontenelle, in his _Entretiens sur la Pluralite\r\ndes Mondes_, informs his pupil, the Marchioness, that \"M. Cassini\r\ndiscovered in the moon something which separates, then reunites, and\r\nfinally loses itself in a cavity, which from its appearance seemed to be\r\na river,\" it can hardly be supposed that what the French astronomer saw,\r\nor fancied he saw, with the imperfect telescopes of that day, was one of\r\nthe remarkable and enigmatical furrows termed clefts or rills, first\r\ndetected by the Hanoverian selenographer Schroter; who, on October 7,\r\n1787, discovered the very curious serpentine cleft near Herodotus, having\r\na few nights before noted for the first time the great Alpine valley west\r\nof Plato, once classed with the clefts, though it is an object of a very\r\ndifferent kind. Between 1787 and 1797 Schroter found ten rills; but\r\ntwenty years elapsed before an addition was made to this number by the\r\ndiscoveries of Gruithuisen, and, a short time after, by those of\r\nLohrmann, who in twelve months (1823-24) detected seventy. Kinau, Madler,\r\nand finally Schmidt, followed, till, in 1866, when the latter published\r\nhis work, _Ueber Rillen auf dem Monde_, the list was thus summarised:--\r\n\r\nIn the 1st or N.W. quadrant     127 rills\r\nIn the 2nd or N.E. quadrant      75 rills\r\nIn the 3rd or S.E. quadrant     141 rills\r\nIn the 4th or S.W. quadrant      82 rills\r\n\r\nor 425 in all. Since the date of this book the number of known rills has\r\nbeen more than doubled; in fact, scarcely a lunation passes without new\r\ndiscoveries being made.\r\n\r\nThe significance of the word _rille_ in German, a groove or furrow,\r\ndescribes with considerable accuracy the usual appearance of the objects\r\nto which it is applied, consisting as they do of long narrow channels,\r\nwith sides more or less steep, and sometimes vertical. They often extend\r\nfor hundreds of miles in approximately straight lines over portions of\r\nthe moon's surface, frequently traversing in their course ridges,\r\ncraters, and even more formidable obstacles, without any apparent check\r\nor interruption, though their ends are sometimes marked by a mound or\r\ncrater. Their length ranges from ten or twelve to three hundred miles or\r\nmore (as in the great Sirsalis rill), their breadth, which is very\r\nvariable within certain limits, from less than half a mile to more than\r\ntwo, and their depth (which must necessarily remain to a great extent\r\nproblematical) from 100 to 400 yards. They exhibit in the telescope a\r\ngradation from somewhat coarse grooves, easily visible at suitable times\r\nin very moderately sized instruments, to striae so delicate as to require\r\nthe largest and most perfect optical means and the best atmospheric\r\nconditions to be glimpsed at all. Viewed under moderate amplification,\r\nthe majority of rills resemble deep canal-like channels with roughly\r\nparallel sides, displaying occasionally local irregularities, and fining\r\noff to invisibility at one or both ends. But, if critically scrutinised\r\nin the best observing weather with high powers, the apparent evenness of\r\ntheir edges entirely disappears, and we find that the latter exhibit\r\nindentations, projections, and little flexures, like the banks of an\r\nordinary stream or rivulet, or, to use a very homely simile, the serrated\r\nedges and little jagged irregularities of a biscuit broken across. In\r\nsome cases we remark crateriform hollows or sudden expansions in their\r\ncourse, and deep sinuous ravines, which render them still more\r\nunsymmetrical and variable in breadth. With regard to their distribution\r\non the lunar surface; they are found in almost every region, but perhaps\r\nnot so frequently on the surface of the Maria as elsewhere, though, as in\r\nthe case of the Triesnecker and other systems, they often abound in the\r\nneighbourhood of disturbed regions in these plains, and in many cases\r\nalong their margins, as, for example, the Gassendi-Mersenius and the\r\nSabine-Ritter groups. The interior of walled plains are frequently\r\nintersected by them, as in Gassendi, where nearly forty, more or less\r\ndelicate examples, have been seen; in Hevel, where there is a very\r\ninteresting system of crossed clefts, and within Posidonius. If we study\r\nany good modern lunar map, it is evident how constantly they appear near\r\nthe borders of mountain ranges, walled-plains, and ring-plains; as, for\r\ninstance, at the foot of the Apennines; near Archimedes, Aristarchus,\r\nRamsden, and in many other similar positions. Rugged highlands also are\r\noften traversed by them, as in the case of those lying west of Le Monnier\r\nand Chacornac, and in the region west of the Mare Humorum. It may be here\r\nremarked, however, as a notable fact, that the neighbourhood of the\r\ngrandest ring-mountain on the moon, Copernicus, is, strange to say,\r\ndevoid of any features which can be classed as true clefts, though it\r\nabounds in crater-rows. The intricate network of rills on the west of\r\nTriesnecker, when observed with a low power, reminds one of the wrinkles\r\non the rind of an orange or on the skin of a withered apple. Gruithuisen,\r\ndescribing the rill-traversed region between Agrippa and Hyginus, says\r\nthat \"it has quite the look of a Dutch canal map.\" In the subjoined\r\ncatalogue many detailed examples will be given relating to the course of\r\nthese mysterious furrows; how they occasionally traverse mountain arms,\r\ncut through, either completely or partially (as in Ramsden), the borders\r\nof ring-plains and other enclosures, while not unfrequently a small mound\r\nor similar feature appears to have caused them to swerve suddenly from\r\ntheir path, as in the case of the Ariadaeus cleft, and in that of one\r\nmember of the Mercator-Campanus system.\r\n\r\nOf the actual nature of the lunar rills we are, it must be confessed,\r\nsupremely ignorant. With some of the early observers it was a very\r\nfavourite notion that they are artificial works, constructed presumably\r\nby Kepler's _sub-volvani_, or by other intelligences. There is perhaps\r\nsome excuse to be made for the freaks of an exuberant fancy in regard to\r\nobjects which, if we ignore for a moment their enormous dimensions,\r\njudged by a terrestrial standard, certainly have, in their apparent\r\nabsence of any physical relation to neighbouring objects, all the\r\nappearance of being works of art rather than of nature. The keen-sighted\r\nand very imaginative Gruithuisen believed that in some instances they\r\nrepresent roads cut through interminable forests, and in others the\r\ndried-up beds of once mighty rivers. His description of the Triesnecker\r\nrill-system reads like a page from a geographical primer. A portion of it\r\nis compared to the river Po, and he traces its course mile by mile up to\r\nthe \"delta\" at its place of disemboguement into the Mare Vaporum. From\r\nthe position of some rills with respect to the contour of the surrounding\r\ncountry, it is evident that if water were now present on the moon, they,\r\nbeing situated at the lowest level, would form natural channels for its\r\nreception; but the exceptions to this arrangement are so numerous and\r\nobvious, that the idea may be at once dismissed that there is any analogy\r\nbetween them and our rivers. The eminent selenographer, the late W.K.\r\nBirt, compared many of them to \"inverted river-beds\" from the fact that,\r\nas often as not, they become broader and deeper as they attain a higher\r\nlevel. The branches resemble rivers more frequently than the main\r\nchannels; for they generally commence as very fine grooves, and, becoming\r\nbroader and broader, join them at an acute angle. An attempt again has\r\nbeen made to compare the lunar clefts with those vast gorges, the\r\nmarvellous results of aqueous action, called canyons, which attain their\r\ngreatest dimensions in North America; such as the Great Canyon of the\r\nColorado, which is at least 300 miles in length, and in places 2000 yards\r\nin depth, with perpendicular or even overhanging sides; but the analogy,\r\nat first sight specious, utterly breaks down under closer examination.\r\nSome selenographers consider them to consist of long-extending rows of\r\nconfluent craters, too minute to be separately distinguished, and to be\r\nthus due to some kind of volcanic action. This is undoubtedly true in\r\nmany instances, for almost every lunar region affords examples of crater-\r\nrows merging by almost imperceptible gradations into cleft-like features,\r\nand crater-rows of considerable size resemble clefts under low powers.\r\nStill it seems probable that the greater number of these features are\r\nimmense furrows or cracks in the surface and nothing more; for the higher\r\nthe magnifying power employed in their examination, the less reason there\r\nis to object to this description. Dr. Klein of Cologne believes that\r\nrills of this class are due to the shrinkage of parts of the moon's\r\ncrust, and that they are not as a rule the result of volcanic causes,\r\nthough he admits that there may be some which have a seismic origin. No\r\ngood reason has as yet been given for the fact that they so frequently\r\ncross small craters and other objects in their course, though it has been\r\nsuggested that the route followed by a rill from crater to crater in\r\nthese instances may be a line of least surface resistance, an explanation\r\nfar from being satisfactory.\r\n\r\nWhether variations in the visibility of lunar details, when observed\r\nunder apparently similar conditions, actually occur from time to time\r\nfrom some unknown cause, is one of those vexed questions which will only\r\nbe determined when the moon is systematically studied by experienced\r\nobservers using the finest instruments at exceptionally good stations;\r\nbut no one who examines existing records of observations of rills by\r\nGruithuisen, Lohrmann, Madler, Schmidt, and other observers, can well\r\navoid the conclusion that the anomalies brought to light therein point\r\nstrongly to the probability of the existence of some agency which\r\noccasionally modifies their appearance or entirely conceals them from\r\nview.\r\n\r\nThe following is one illustration out of many which might be quoted. At a\r\npoint in its course, nearly due north of the ring-plain Agrippa, the\r\ngreat Ariadaeus cleft sends out a branch which runs into the well-known\r\nHyginus cleft, reminding one, as Dr. Klein remarks, of two rivers\r\nconnected in the shortest way by a canal. This uniting furrow was\r\ndetected by Gruithuisen, who observed it several times. On some occasions\r\nit appeared perfectly straight, at others very irregular; but, what is\r\nvery remarkable, although two such accurate observers as Lohrmann and\r\nMadler frequently scrutinised the region, neither of them saw a trace of\r\nthis object; and but for its rediscovery by Schmidt in 1862, its\r\nexistence would certainly have been ignored by selenographers as a mere\r\nfigment of Gruithuisen's too lively imagination. Dr. Klein has frequently\r\nseen this rill with great distinctness, and at other times sought for it\r\nin vain; though on each occasion the conditions of illumination,\r\nlibration, and definition were practically similar. I have sometimes\r\nfound this cleft an easy object with a 4 inch achromatic. Again, many\r\nrills described by Madler as very delicate and difficult to trace, may\r\nnow be easily followed in \"common telescopes.\" In short, the more direct\r\ntelescopic observations accumulate, and the more the study of minute\r\ndetail is extended, the stronger becomes the conviction, that in spite of\r\nthe absence of an appreciable atmosphere, there may be something\r\nresembling low-lying exhalations from some parts of the surface which\r\nfrom time to time are sufficiently dense to obscure, or even obliterate,\r\nthe region beneath them.\r\n\r\nIf, as seems most probable, these gigantic cracks are due to contractions\r\nof the moon's surface, it is not impossible, in spite of the assertions\r\nof the text-books to the effect that our satellite is now \"a changeless\r\nworld,\" that emanations may proceed from these fissures, even if, under\r\nthe monthly alternations of extreme temperatures, surface changes do not\r\nnow occasionally take place from this cause also. Should this be so, the\r\nappearance of new rills and the extension and modification of those\r\nalready existing may reasonably be looked for. Many instances might be\r\nadduced tending to confirm this supposition, to one of which, as coming\r\nunder my notice, I will briefly refer. On the evening of November 11,\r\n1883, when examining the interior of the great ring-plain Mersenius with\r\na power of 350 on an 8 1/2 inch reflector; in addition to the two closely\r\nparallel clefts discovered by Schmidt, running from the inner foot of the\r\nnorth-eastern rampart towards the centre, I remarked another distinct\r\ncleft crossing the northern part of the floor from side to side. Shortly\r\nafterwards, M. Gaudibert, one of our most experienced selenographers, who\r\nhas discovered many hitherto unrecorded clefts, having seen my drawing,\r\nsearched for this object, and, though the night was far from favourable,\r\nhad distinct though brief glimpses of it with the moderate magnifying\r\npower of 100. Mersenius is a formation about 40 miles in diameter, with a\r\nprominently convex interior, containing much detail which has received\r\nmore than ordinary attention from observers. It has, moreover, been\r\nspecially mapped by Schmidt and others, yet no trace of this rill was\r\nnoted, though objects much more minute and difficult have not been\r\noverlooked. Does not an instance of this kind raise a well-grounded\r\nsuspicion of recent change which it is difficult to explain away?\r\n\r\nTo see the lunar clefts to the best advantage, they must be looked for\r\nwhen not very far removed from the terminator, as when so situated the\r\nblack shadow of one side, contrasted with the usually brightly-\r\nilluminated opposite flank, renders them more conspicuous than when they\r\nare viewed under a higher sun. Though, as a rule, invisible at full moon,\r\nsome of the coarser clefts--as, for example, a portion of the Hyginus\r\nfurrow, and that north of Birt--may be traced as delicate white lines\r\nunder a nearly vertical light.\r\n\r\nFor properly observing these objects, a power of not less than 300 on\r\ntelescopes of large aperture is needed; and in studying their minute and\r\ndelicate details, we are perhaps more dependent on atmospheric conditions\r\nthan in following up any other branch of observational astronomy. Few\r\nindeed are the nights, in our climate at any rate, when the rough,\r\nirregular character of the steep interior of even the coarser examples of\r\nthese immense chasms can be steadily seen. We can only hope to obtain a\r\nmore perfect insight into their actual structural peculiarities when they\r\nare scrutinised under more perfect climatic circumstances than they have\r\nbeen hitherto. When observing the Hyginus cleft, Dr. Klein noticed that\r\nat one place the declivities of the interior displayed decided\r\ndifferences of tint. At many points the reflected sunlight was of a\r\ndistinctly yellow hue, while in other places it was white, as if the\r\ncliffs were covered with snow. He compares this portion of the rill to\r\nthe Rhine valley between Bingen and Coblentz, but adds that the latter,\r\nif viewed from the moon, would probably not present so fresh an\r\nappearance, and would, of course, be frequently obscured by clouds.\r\n\r\nSince the erection of the great Lick telescope on Mount Hamilton, our\r\nknowledge of the details of some of the lunar clefts has been greatly\r\nincreased, as in the case of the Ariadaeus cleft, and many others.\r\nProfessor W.H. Pickering, also, at Arequipa, has made at that ideal\r\nastronomical site many observations which, when published, will throw\r\nmore light upon their peculiar characteristics.\r\n\r\nA few years ago M.E.L. Trouvelot of Meudon drew attention to a curious\r\nappearance which he noted in connection with certain rills when near the\r\nterminator, viz., extremely attenuated threads of light on their sites\r\nand their apparent prolongations. He observed it in the ring-plain\r\nEudoxus, crossing the southern side of the floor from wall to wall; and\r\nalso in connection with the prominent cleft running from the north side\r\nof Burg to the west of Alexander, and in some other situations. He terms\r\nthese phenomena _Murs enigmatiques_. Apparent prolongations of clefts in\r\nthe form of rows of hillocks or small mounds are very common.\r\n\r\nFAULTS.--These sudden drops in the surface, representing local\r\ndislocations, are far from unusual: the best examples being the straight\r\nwall, or \"railroad,\" west of Birt; that which strikes obliquely across\r\nPlato; another which traverses Phocylides; and a fourth that has\r\nmanifestly modified the mountain arm north of Cichus. They differ from\r\nthe terrestrial phenomena so designated in the fact that the surface\r\nindications of these are destroyed by denudation or masked by deposits of\r\nsubsequent date. In many cases on the moon, though its course cannot be\r\ntraced in its entirety by its shadow, yet the existence of a fault may be\r\ninferred by the displacement and fracture of neighbouring objects.\r\n\r\nVALLEYS.--Features thus designated, differing greatly both in size and\r\ncharacter, are met with in almost every part of the surface, except on\r\nthe grey plains. While the smallest examples, from their delicacy,\r\ntenuity, and superficial resemblance to rills, are termed rill-valleys,\r\nthe larger and more conspicuous assume the appearance of coarse chasms,\r\ngorges, or trough-like depressions. Between these two extremes, are many\r\nobjects of moderate dimensions--winding or straight ravines and defiles\r\nbounded by steep mountains, and shallow dales flanked by low rounded\r\nheights. The rill valleys are very numerous, only differing in many\r\ninstances from the true rills in size, and are probably due to the same\r\ncause. Among the most noteworthy valleys of the largest class must, of\r\ncourse, be placed the great valley of the Alps, one of the most striking\r\nobjects in the northern hemisphere, which also includes the great valley\r\nsouth-east of Ukert. The Rheita valley, the very similar chasm west of\r\nReichenbach, and the gorge west of Herschel, are also notable examples in\r\nthe southern hemisphere. The borders of some of the Maria (especially\r\nthat of the Mare Crisium) and of many of the depressed rimless\r\nformations, furnish instances of winding valleys intersecting their\r\nborders: the hilly regions likewise often abound in long branching\r\ndefiles.\r\n\r\nBRIGHT RAY-SYSTEMS.--Reference has already been made to the faint light\r\nstreaks and markings often found on the floors of the ring-mountains and\r\nin other situations, and to the brilliant _nimbi_ surrounding some of the\r\nsmaller craters; but, in addition to these, many objects on the moon's\r\nvisible surface are associated with a much more remarkable and\r\nconspicuous phenomenon--the bright rays which, under a high sun, are seen\r\neither to radiate from them as apparent centres to great distances, or,\r\nin the form of irregular light areas, to environ them, and to throw out\r\nwide-spreading lucid beams, extending occasionally many hundreds of miles\r\nfrom their origin. The more striking of these systems were recognised and\r\ndrawn at a very early stage of telescopic observation, as may be seen if\r\nwe consult the quaint old charts of Hevel, Riccioli, Fontana, and other\r\nobservers of the seventeenth century, where they are always prominently,\r\nthough very inaccurately, portrayed. The principal ray-systems are those\r\nof Tycho, Copernicus, Kepler, Anaxagoras, Aristarchus, Olbers, Byrgius A,\r\nand Zuchius; while Autolycus, Aristillus, Proclus, Timocharis, Furnerius\r\nA, and Menelaus are grouped as constituting minor systems. Many\r\nadditional centres exist, a list of which will be found in the appendix.\r\n\r\nThe rays emanating from Tycho surpass in extent and interest any of the\r\nothers. Hundreds of distinct light streaks originate round the grey\r\nmargin of this magnificent object, some of them extending over a greater\r\npart of the moon's visible superficies, and \"radiating,\" in the words of\r\nProfessor Phillips, \"like false meridians, or like meridians true to an\r\nearlier pole of rotation.\" No systematic attempt has yet been made to map\r\nthem accurately as a whole on a large scale, for their extreme intricacy\r\nand delicacy would render the task a very difficult one, and, moreover,\r\nwould demand a long course of observation with a powerful telescope in an\r\nideal situation; but Professor W.H. Pickering, observing under these\r\nconditions at Arequipa, has recently devoted considerable attention both\r\nto the Tycho and other rays, with especially suggestive and important\r\nresults, which may be briefly summarised as follows:--\r\n\r\n(1.) That the Tycho streaks do not radiate from the apparent centre of\r\nthis formation, but point towards a multitude of minute craterlets on its\r\nsouth-eastern or northern rims. Similar craterlets occur on the rims of\r\nother great craters, forming ray-centres.\r\n(2.) Speaking generally, a very minute and brilliant crater is located at\r\nthe end of the streak nearest the radiant point, the streak spreading out\r\nand becoming fainter towards the other end. The majority of the streaks\r\nappear to issue from one or more of these minute craters, which rarely\r\nexceed a mile in diameter.\r\n(3.) The streaks which do not issue from minute craters, usually lie upon\r\nor across ridges, or in other similar exposed situations, sometimes\r\napparently coming through notches in the mountain walls.\r\n(4.) Many of the Copernicus streaks start from craterlets within the rim,\r\nflow up the inside and down the outside of the walls. Kepler includes two\r\nsuch craterlets, but here the flow seems to have been more uniform over\r\nthe edges of the whole crater, and is not distinctly divided up into\r\nseparate streams.\r\n(5.) Though there are similar craters within Tycho, the streaks from them\r\ndo not extend far beyond the walls. All the conspicuous Tycho streaks\r\noriginate outside the rim.\r\n(6.) The streaks of Copernicus, Kepler, and Aristarchus are greyish in\r\ncolour, and much less white than those associated with Tycho: some white\r\nlines extending south-east from Aristarchus do not apparently belong to\r\nthe system. In the case of craterlets lying between Aristarchus and\r\nCopernicus the streaks point away from the latter.\r\n(7.) There are no very long streaks; they vary from ten to fifty miles in\r\nlength, and are rarely more than a quarter of a mile broad at the crater.\r\nFrom this point they gradually widen out and become fainter. Their width,\r\nhowever, at the end farthest from the crater, seldom exceeds five miles.\r\n\r\nThese statements, especially those relating to the length of the streaks,\r\nare utterly opposed to prevailing notions, but Professor Pickering\r\nspecifies the case of the two familiar parallel rays extending from the\r\nnorth-east of Tycho to the region east of Bullialdus. His observations\r\nshow that these streaks, originating at a number of little craters\r\nsituated from thirty to sixty miles beyond the confines of Tycho, \"enter\r\na couple of broad slightly depressed valleys. In these valleys are found\r\nnumerous minute craters of the kind above described, with intensely\r\nbrilliant interiors. When the streaks issuing from those craters near\r\nTycho are nearly exhausted, they are reinforced by streaks from other\r\ncraters which they encounter upon the way, the streaks becoming more\r\npronounced at these points. These streaks are again reinforced farther\r\nout. These parallel rays must therefore not be considered as two streaks,\r\nbut as two series of streaks, the components of which are placed end to\r\nend.\"\r\n\r\nThus, according to Professor Pickering, we must no longer regard the rays\r\nemanating from the Tycho region and other centres as continuous, but as\r\nconsisting of a succession of short lengths, diminishing in brilliancy\r\nbut increasing in width, till they reach the next crater lying in their\r\ndirection, when they are reinforced; and the same process of gradual\r\ndiminution in brightness and reinforcement goes on from one end to the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThe following explanation is suggested to account for the origin of the\r\nrays:--\"The earth and her satellite may differ not so much as regards\r\nvolcanic action as in the densities of their atmospheres. Thus if the\r\ncraterlets on the rim of Tycho were constantly giving out large\r\nquantities of gas or steam, which in other regions was being constantly\r\nabsorbed or condensed, we should have a wind uniformly blowing away from\r\nthat summit in all directions. Should other summits in its vicinity\r\noccasionally give out gases, mixed with any fine white powder, such as\r\npumice, this powder would be carried away from Tycho, forming streaks.\"\r\n\r\nThe difficulty surrounding this very ingenious hypothesis is, that\r\nthough, assuming the existence of pumice-emitting craters and regions of\r\ncondensation, there might be a more or less lineal and streaky deposition\r\nof this white material over large areas of the moon, why should this\r\ndeposit be so definitely arranged, and why should these active little\r\ncraters happen to lie on these particular lines?\r\n\r\nThe confused network of streaks round Copernicus seem to respond more\r\nhappily to the requirements of Professor Pickering's hypothesis, for here\r\nthere is an absence of that definiteness of direction so manifestly\r\ndisplayed in the case of the Tycho rays, and we can well imagine that\r\nwith an area of condensation surrounding this magnificent object beyond\r\nthe limits of the streaks, and a number of active little craters on and\r\nabout its rim, the white material ejected might be drawn outwards in\r\nevery direction by wind currents, which possibly once existed, and,\r\nsettling down, assume forms such as we see.\r\n\r\nNasmyth's well-known hypothesis attributes the radiating streaks to\r\ncracks in the lunar globe caused by the action of an upheaving force, and\r\naccounts for their whiteness by the outwelling of lava from them which\r\nhas spread to a greater or less distance on either side. If the moon has\r\nbeen fractured in this way, we can easily suppose that the craters formed\r\non these fissures, being in communication with the interior, might eject\r\nsome pulverulent white matter long after the rest of the surface with its\r\nother types of craters had attained a quiescent stage.\r\n\r\nThe Tycho rays, when viewed under ordinary conditions, appear to extend\r\nin unbroken bands to immense distances. One of the most remarkable,\r\nstrikes along the eastern side of Fracastorius, across the Mare Nectaris\r\nto Guttemberg, while another, more central, extends, with local\r\nvariations in brightness, through Menelaus, over the Mare Serenitatis\r\nnearly to the north-west limb. This is the ray that figures so\r\nprominently in rude woodcuts of the moon, in which the Mare Serenitatis\r\ntraversed by it is made to resemble the Greek letter PHI. The Kepler,\r\nAristarchus, and Copernicus systems, though of much smaller extent, are\r\nvery noteworthy from the crossing and apparent interference of the rays;\r\nwhile those near Byrgius, round Aristarchus, and the rays from Proclus,\r\nare equally remarkable.\r\n\r\n[Nichol found that the rays from Kepler cut through rays from Copernicus\r\nand Aristarchus, while rays from the latter cut through rays from the\r\nformer. He therefore inferred that their relative ages stand in the\r\norder,--Copernicus, Aristarchus, Kepler.]\r\n\r\nAs no branch of selenography has been more neglected than the observation\r\nof these interesting but enigmatical features, one may hope that, in\r\nspite of the exacting conditions as to situation and instrumental\r\nrequirements necessary for their successful scrutiny, the fairly equipped\r\namateur in this less favoured country will not be deterred from\r\nattempting to clear up some of the doubts and difficulties which at\r\npresent exist as to their actual nature.\r\n\r\nTHE MOON'S ALBEDO, SURFACE BRIGHTNESS, &c.--Sir John Herschel maintained\r\nthat \"the actual illumination of the lunar surface is not much superior\r\nto that of weathered sandstone rock in full sunshine.\" \"I have,\" he says,\r\n\"frequently compared the moon setting behind the grey perpendicular\r\nfacade of the Table Mountain, illuminated by the sun just risen in the\r\nopposite quarter of the horizon, when it has been scarcely\r\ndistinguishable in brightness from the rock in contact with it. The sun\r\nand moon being at nearly equal altitudes, and the atmosphere perfectly\r\nfree from cloud or vapour, its effect is alike on both luminaries.\"\r\nZollner's elaborate researches on this question are closely in accord\r\nwith the above observational result. Though he considers that the\r\nbrightest parts of the surface are as white as the whitest objects with\r\nwhich we are acquainted, yet, taking the reflected light as a whole, he\r\nfinds that the moon is more nearly black than white. The most brilliant\r\nobject on the surface is the central peak of the ring-plain Aristarchus,\r\nthe darkest the floor of Grimaldi, or perhaps a portion of that of the\r\nneighbouring Riccioli. Between these extremes, there is every gradation\r\nof tone. Proctor, discussing this question on the basis of Zollner's\r\nexperiments respecting the light reflected by various substances,\r\nconcludes that the dark area just mentioned must be notably darker than\r\nthe dark grey syenite which figures in his tables, while the floor of\r\nAristarchus is as white as newly fallen snow.\r\n\r\nThe estimation of lunar tints in the usual way, by eye observations at\r\nthe telescope, involving as it does physiological errors which cannot be\r\neliminated, is a method far too crude and ambiguous to form the basis of\r\na scientific scale or for the detection of slight variations. An\r\ninstrument on the principle of Dawes' solar eyepiece has been suggested;\r\nthis, if used with an invariable and absolute scale of tints, would\r\nremove many difficulties attending these investigations. The scale which\r\nwas adopted by Schroter, and which has been used by selenographers up to\r\nthe present time, is as follows:--\r\n\r\n 0 deg. = Black.\r\n 1 deg. = Greyish black.\r\n 2 deg. = Dark grey.\r\n 3 deg. = Medium grey.\r\n 4 deg. = Yellowish grey.\r\n 5 deg. = Pure light grey.\r\n 6 deg. = Light whitish grey.\r\n 7 deg. = Greyish white.\r\n 8 deg. = Pure white.\r\n 9 deg. = Glittering white.\r\n10 deg. = Dazzling white.\r\n\r\nThe following is a list of lunar objects published in the\r\n_Selenographical Journal_, classed in accordance with this scale:--\r\n\r\n0     deg.

Central peak of Aristarchus.\r\n\r\nTEMPERATURE OF THE MOON'S SURFACE.--Till the subject was undertaken some\r\nyears ago by Lord Rosse, no approach was made to a satisfactory\r\ndetermination of the surface temperature of the moon. From his\r\nexperiments he inferred that the maximum temperature attained, at or near\r\nthe equator, about three days after full moon, does not exceed 200 deg.\r\nC., while the minimum is not much under zero C. Subsequent experiments,\r\nhowever, both by himself and Professor Langley, render these results more\r\nthan doubtful, without it is admitted that the moon has an atmospheric\r\ncovering. Langley's results make it probable that the temperature never\r\nrises above the freezing-point of water, and that at the end of the\r\nprolonged lunar night of fourteen days it must sink to at least 200 deg.\r\nbelow zero. Mr. F.W. Verey of the Alleghany Observatory has recently\r\nconducted, by means of the bolometer, similar researches as to the\r\ndistribution of the moon's heat and its variation with the phase, by\r\nwhich he has deduced the varying radiation from the surface in different\r\nlocalities of the moon under various solar altitudes.\r\n\r\nLUNAR OBSERVATION.--In observing the moon, we enjoy an advantage of which\r\nwe cannot boast when most other planetary bodies are scrutinised; for we\r\nsee the actual surface of another world undimmed by palpable clouds or\r\nexhalations, except such as exist in the air above us; and can gaze on\r\nthe marvellous variety of objects it presents much as we contemplate a\r\nrelief map of our own globe. But inasmuch as the manifold details of the\r\nrelief map require to be placed in a certain light to be seen to the best\r\nadvantage, so the ring-mountains, rugged highlands, and wide-extending\r\nplains of our satellite, as they pass in review under the sun, must be\r\nobserved when suitable conditions of illumination prevail, if we wish to\r\nappreciate their true character and significance.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, lunar objects are best seen when they are at no great\r\ndistance from \"the terminator,\" or the line dividing the illumined from\r\nthe unillumined portion of the spherical surface. This line is constantly\r\nchanging its position with the sun, advancing slowly onwards towards the\r\neast at a rate which, roughly speaking, amounts to about 30.5 min. in an\r\nhour, or passing over 10 deg. of lunar longitude in about 19 hrs. 40\r\nmins. When an object is situated on this line, the sun is either rising\r\nor setting on the neighbouring region, and every inequality of the\r\nsurface is rendered prominent by its shadow; so that trifling variations\r\nin level and minor asperities assume for the time being an importance to\r\nwhich they have no claim. If we are observing an object at lunar sunrise,\r\na very short time, often only a few minutes, elapses before the confusion\r\ncaused by the presence of the shadows of these generally unimportant\r\nfeatures ceases to interfere with the observation, and we can distinguish\r\nbetween those details which are really noteworthy and others which are\r\ntrivial and evanescent. Every formation we are studying should be\r\nobserved, and drawn if possible, under many different conditions of\r\nillumination. It ought, in fact, to be examined from the time when its\r\nloftiest heights are first illumined by the rising sun till they\r\ndisappear at sunset. This is, of course, practically impossible in the\r\ncourse of one lunation, but by utilising available opportunities, a\r\nnumber of observations may be obtained under various phases which will be\r\nmore or less exhaustive. It cannot be said that much is known about any\r\nobject until an attempt has been made to carry out this plan. Features\r\nwhich assume a certain appearance at one phase frequently turn out to be\r\naltogether different when viewed under another; important details\r\nobscured by shadows, craters masked by those of neighbouring objects, or\r\nby the shadows of their own rims, are often only revealed when the sun\r\nhas attained an altitude of ten degrees or more. In short, there is\r\nscarcely a formation on the moon which does not exemplify the necessity\r\nof noting its aspect from sunrise to sunset. Regard must also be had to\r\nlibration, which affects to a greater or less degree every object;\r\ncarrying out of the range of observation regions near the limb at one\r\ntime, and at another bringing into view others beyond the limits of the\r\nmaps, which represent the moon in the mean state of libration. The area,\r\nin fact, thus brought into view, or taken out of it, is between 1/12th\r\nand 1/13th of the entire area of the moon, or about the 1/6th part of the\r\nhemisphere turned away from the earth. It is convenient to bear in mind\r\nthat we see an object under nearly the same conditions every 59 d. 1 h.\r\n28 m., or still more accurately, after the lapse of fifteen lunations, or\r\n442 d. 23 h. Many observers avoid the observation of objects under a high\r\nlight. This, however, should never be neglected when practicable, though\r\nin some cases it is not easy to carry out, owing to the difficulty in\r\ntracing details under these circumstances.\r\n\r\nAlthough to observe successfully the minuter features, such as the rills\r\nand the smaller craterlets, requires instruments of large aperture\r\nlocated in favourable situations, yet work of permanent value may be\r\naccomplished with comparatively humble telescopic means. A 4 inch\r\nachromatic, or a silver-on-glass reflector of 6 or 6 1/2 inches aperture,\r\nwill reveal on a good night many details which have not yet been\r\nrecorded, and the possessor of instruments of this size will not be long\r\nin discovering that the moon, despite of what is often said, has not been\r\nso exhaustively surveyed that nothing remains for him to do.\r\n\r\nOnly experience and actual trial will teach the observer to choose the\r\nparticular eyepiece suitable for a given night or a given object. It will\r\nbe found that it is only on very rare occasions that he can accomplish\r\nmuch with powers which, perhaps only on two or three nights in a year in\r\nthis climate, tell to great advantage; though it sometimes happens that\r\nthe employment of an eyepiece, otherwise unsuitable for the night, will,\r\nduring a short spell of good definition, afford a fleeting glimpse of\r\nsome difficult feature, and thus solve a doubtful point. It has often\r\nbeen said that the efficiency of a telescope depends to a great extent on\r\n\"the man at the eye end.\" This is as true in the case of the moon as it\r\nis in other branches of observational astronomy.\r\n\r\nObservers, especially beginners, frequently fall into great error in\r\nfailing to appreciate the true character of what they see. In this way a\r\nshallow surface depression, possibly only a few feet below the general\r\nlevel of the neighbouring country, is often described as a \"vast gorge,\"\r\nbecause, under very oblique light, it is filled with black shadow; or an\r\ninsignificant hillock is magnified into a mountain when similarly viewed.\r\nHence the importance, just insisted on, of studying lunar features under\r\nas many conditions as possible before finally attempting to describe\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nHowever indifferent a draughtsman an observer may be, if he endeavours to\r\nportray what he sees to the best of his ability, he will ultimately\r\nattain sufficient skill to make his work useful for future reference: in\r\nany case, it will be of more value than a mere verbal description without\r\na sketch. Doubt and uncertainty invariably attend to a greater or less\r\nextent written notes unaccompanied by drawings, as some recent\r\ncontroversies, respecting changes in Linne and elsewhere, testify. Now\r\nthat photographs are generally available to form the basis of a more\r\ncomplete sketch, much of the difficulty formerly attending the correct\r\nrepresentation of the outline and grosser features of a formation has\r\nbeen removed, and the observer can devote his time and attention to the\r\ninsertion and description of less obvious objects.\r\n\r\nPROGRESS OF SELENOGRAPHY.--Till within recent years, the systematic study\r\nof the lunar surface may be said to have been confined, in this country\r\nat any rate, to a very limited number of observers, and, except in rare\r\ninstances, those who possessed astronomical telescopes only directed them\r\nto the moon as a show object to excite the wonder of casual visitors. The\r\npublication of Webb's \"Celestial Objects\" in 1859, the supposed physical\r\nchange in the crater Linne, announced in 1866, and the appearance of an\r\nunrecorded black spot near Hyginus some ten years later, had the effect\r\nof awakening a more lively interest in selenography, and undoubtedly\r\ncombined to bring about a change in this respect, which ultimately\r\nresulted in the number of amateurs devoting much of their time to this\r\nbranch of observational astronomy being notably increased. Still, large\r\ntelescopes, as a rule, held aloof for some unexplained reason, or were\r\nonly employed in a desultory and spasmodic fashion, without any very\r\ndefinite object. When the Council of the British Association for the\r\nAdvancement of Science, stimulated by the Linne controversy, deemed the\r\nmoon to be worthy of passing attention, observations, directed to objects\r\nsuspected of change (the phenomena on the floor of Plato) were left to\r\nthree or four observers, under the able direction of Mr. Birt, the\r\nlargest instruments available being an 8 1/4 inch reflector and the\r\nCrossley refractor of 9 inches aperture! During the last decade, however,\r\nall this has been changed, and we not only have societies, such as the\r\nBritish Astronomical Association, setting apart a distinct section for\r\nthe systematic investigation of lunar detail, but some of the largest and\r\nmost perfect instruments in the world, among them the noble refractor on\r\nMount Hamilton, employed in photographing the moon or in scrutinising her\r\nmanifold features by direct observation. Hence, it may be said that\r\nselenography has taken a new and more promising departure, which, among\r\nother results, must lead to a more accurate knowledge of lunar\r\ntopography, and settle possibly, ere long, the vexed question of change,\r\nwithout any residuum of doubt.\r\n\r\nLunar photography as exemplified by the marvellous and beautiful pictures\r\nproduced at the Lick Observatory under the auspices of Dr. Holden, and\r\nthe exquisite enlargements of them by Dr. Weinek of Prague; at Paris by\r\nthe brothers Henry; and at Brussels by M. Prinz; point to the not far\r\ndistant time when we shall possess complete photographic maps on a large\r\nscale of the whole visible disc under various phases of illumination,\r\nwhich will be of inestimable value as topographical charts. When this is\r\naccomplished, the observer will have at his command faithful\r\nrepresentations of any formation, or of any given region he may require,\r\nto utilise for the study of the smaller details by direct observation.\r\n\r\nDesultory and objectless drawings and notes have hitherto been more or\r\nless characteristic of the work done, even by those who have given more\r\nthan ordinary attention to the moon. Though these, if duly recorded, are\r\nvaluable as illustrating the physical structure, the estimated brightness\r\nunder various phases, and other peculiarities of lunar features, they do\r\nnot materially forward investigations relating to the discovery of\r\npresent lunar activity or to the detection of actual change. It is\r\nreiterated _ad nauseam_ in many popular books that the moon is a\r\nchangeless world, and it is implied that, having attained a state when no\r\nfurther manifestations of internal or external forces are possible, it\r\nrevolves round the earth in the condition, for the most part, of a\r\nglobular mass of vesicular lava or slag, possessing no interest except as\r\na notable example of a \"burnt-out planet.\" In answer to these dogmatic\r\nassertions, it may be said that, notwithstanding the multiplication of\r\nmonographs and photographs, the knowledge we possess, even of the larger\r\nand more prominent objects, is far too slight to justify us in\r\nmaintaining that changes, which on earth we should use a strong adjective\r\nto describe, have not taken place in connection with some of them in\r\nrecent years. Would the most assiduous observer assert that his knowledge\r\nof any one of the great formations, in the south-west quadrant, for\r\nexample, is so complete that, if a chasm as big as the Val del Bove was\r\nblown out from its flanks, or formed by a landslip, he would detect the\r\nchange in the appearance of an area (some three miles by four) thus\r\nbrought about, unless he had previously made a very prolonged and\r\nexhaustive study of the object? Or, again, among formations of a\r\ndifferent class, the craters and crater-cones; might not objects as large\r\nas Monte Nuovo or Jorullo come into existence in many regions without any\r\none being the wiser? It would certainly have needed a persistent lunar\r\nastronomer, and one furnished with a very perfect telescope, to have\r\nnoted the changes that have occurred within the old crater-ring of Somma\r\nor among the Santorin group during the past thirty years, or even to have\r\ndetected the effects resulting from the great catastrophe in A.D. 79, at\r\nVesuvius; yet these objects are no larger than many which, if they were\r\nsituated on our satellite, would be termed comparatively small, if not\r\ninsignificant.\r\n\r\nOne of the principal aims of lunar research is to learn as much as\r\npossible as to the present condition of the surface. Every one qualified\r\nto give an opinion will admit that this cannot be accomplished by roaming\r\nat large over the whole visible superficies, but only by confining\r\nattention to selected areas of limited extent, and recording and\r\ndescribing every object visible thereon, under various conditions of\r\nillumination, with the greatest accuracy attainable. This plan was\r\nsuggested and inaugurated nearly thirty years ago by Mr. Birt, under the\r\npatronage of the British Association; but as he proposed to deal with the\r\nentire disc in this way, the magnitude and ambitious character of the\r\nscheme soon damped the ardour of those who at first supported it, and it\r\nwas ultimately abandoned. It was, however, based on the only feasible\r\nprinciple which, as it seems to the writer, will not result in doubt and\r\nconfusion. Now that photography has come to the assistance of the\r\nobserver, Mr. Birt's proposal, if confined within narrower limits, would\r\nbe far less arduous an undertaking than before, and might be easily\r\ncarried out. A complete photographic survey of a few selected regions, as\r\na basis for an equally thorough and exhaustive scrutiny by direct\r\nobservation, would, it is believed, lead to a much more satisfactory and\r\nhopeful method for ultimately furnishing irrefragable testimony as to\r\npermanency or change than any that has yet been undertaken.\r\n\r\n\r\nCATALOGUE OF LUNAR FORMATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST QUADRANT\r\n\r\n\r\nWEST LONGITUDE 90 deg. TO 60 deg.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCHUBERT.--This ring-plain, about 46 miles in diameter, situated on the\r\nN.E. side of the Mare Smythii, is too near the limb to be well observed.\r\n\r\nNEPER.--Though still nearer the limb, this walled-plain, 74 miles in\r\ndiameter, is a much more conspicuous object. It has a lofty border and a\r\nprominent central mountain, the highest portion of a range of hills which\r\ntraverses the interior from N. to S.\r\n\r\nAPOLLONIUS.--A ring-plain, 30 miles in diameter, standing in the\r\nmountainous region S. of the Mare Crisium. There is a large crater on the\r\nS.W. wall, and another, somewhat smaller, adjoining it on the N. There\r\nare many brilliant craters in the vicinity.\r\n\r\nFIRMICUS.--A somewhat larger, more regular, but, in other respects, very\r\nsimilar ring-plain, N.W. of the last. Some distance on the W., Madler\r\nnoted a number of dark-grey streaks which apparently undergo periodical\r\nchanges, suggestive of something akin to vegetation. They are situated\r\nnear a prominent mountain situated in a level region.\r\n\r\nAZOUT.--A small ring-plain, connected with the last by a lofty ridge. It\r\nis the apparent centre of many other ridges and valleys which radiate\r\nfrom it towards the N.W. and the Mare Crisium. There is a central\r\nmountain, not an easy telescopic object, on its dusky floor.\r\n\r\nCONDORCET.--A very prominent ring-plain, 45 miles in diameter, situated\r\non the mountainous S.W. margin of the Mare Crisium. It is encircled by a\r\nlofty wall about 8000 feet in height. The dark interior of this and of\r\nthe three preceding formations render them easily traceable under a high\r\nangle of illumination.\r\n\r\nHANSEN.--A ring-plain, 32 miles in diameter, on the W. border of the Mare\r\nCrisium N. of Condorcet. Schmidt shows a central mountain and a terraced\r\nwall.\r\n\r\nALHAZEN.--This ring-plain, rather smaller than the last, is the most\r\nnortherly of the linear chain of formations, associated with the\r\nhighlands bordering the S.W. and the W. flanks of the Mare Crisium. It\r\nhas a central mountain and other minor elevations on the floor. There is\r\na little ring between Alhazen and Hansen, never very conspicuous in the\r\ntelescope, which is plainly traceable in good photographs.\r\n\r\nEIMMART.--A conspicuous ring-plain with bright walls on the N.W. margin\r\nof the Mare Crisium. The E. border attains a height of 10,000 feet above\r\nthe interior, which, according to Schmidt, has a small central mountain.\r\nThere is a rill-like valley on the E. of the formation.\r\n\r\nORIANI.--An irregular object, 32 miles in diameter, somewhat difficult to\r\nidentify, N.W. of the last. There is a conspicuous crater on the N. of\r\nit, with which it is connected by a prominent ridge.\r\n\r\nPLUTARCH.--A fine ring-plain W. of Oriani, with regular walls, and,\r\naccording to Neison, with two central mountains, only one of which I have\r\nseen. Both this formation and the last are beautifully shown in a\r\nphotograph taken August 19, 1891, at the Lick Observatory, when the\r\nmoon's age was 15 d. 10 hrs.\r\n\r\nSENECA.--Rather smaller than Plutarch. Too near the limb for satisfactory\r\nobservation. Schmidt shows two considerable mountains in the interior.\r\nThe position of this object in Schmidt's chart is not accordant with its\r\nplace in Beer and Madler's map, nor in that of Neison.\r\n\r\nHAHN.--A ring-plain, 46 miles in diameter, with a fine central mountain\r\nand lofty peaks on the border, which is not continuous on the S. There is\r\na large and prominent crater on the E.\r\n\r\nBEROSUS.--A somewhat smaller object of a similar type, N. of Hahn, but\r\nwith a loftier wall. There is a want of continuity also in the border,\r\nthe eastern and western sections of which, instead of joining, extend for\r\nsome distance towards the S., forming a narrow gorge or valley. Outside\r\nthe S.E. wall there is a small crater, and some irregular depressions on\r\nthe E. The minute central mountain is only seen with difficulty under a\r\nlow evening sun. The bright region between Hahn and Berosus and the\r\nwestern flank of Cleomedes is an extensive plain, devoid of prominent\r\ndetail, and which, according to Neison, includes an area of 40,000 square\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nGAUSS.--A large, and nearly circular walled-plain, 111 miles in diameter,\r\nsituated close to the N.W. limb, and consequently always foreshortened\r\ninto a more or less elongated ellipse. But for this it would be one of\r\nthe grandest objects in the first quadrant. Under the designation of\r\n\"Mercurius Falsus\" it received great attention from Schroter, who gives\r\nseveral representations of it in his _Selenotopographische Fragmente_,\r\nwhich, though drawn in his usual conventional style, convey a juster idea\r\nof its salient features than many subsequent drawings made under far\r\nbetter optical conditions. The border, especially on the W., is very\r\ncomplex, and is discontinuous on the S., where it is intersected by more\r\nthan one pass, and is prolonged far beyond the apparent limits of the\r\nformation. The most noteworthy feature is the magnificent mountain chain\r\nwhich traverses the floor from N. to S. It is interesting to watch the\r\nprogress of sunset thereon, and see peak after peak disappear, till only\r\nthe great central boss and a few minute glittering points of light,\r\nrepresenting the loftier portions of the chain, remain to indicate its\r\nposition. Madler expatiates on the sublime view which would be obtained\r\nby any one standing on the highest peak and observing the setting sun on\r\none side of him and the nearly \"full\" earth on the other; while beneath\r\nhim would lie a vast plain, shrouded in darkness, surrounded by the\r\nbrilliantly illuminated peaks on the lofty border, gradually passing out\r\nof sunlight. In addition to the central mountain range, there are some\r\nlarge rings, craters, hillocks, &c., on the floor; and on the inner slope\r\nof the W. border there is a very large circular enclosure resembling a\r\nring-plain, not recorded in the maps. Schmidt shows a row of large\r\ncraters on the outer slope of the E. border. Of these, one is very\r\nconspicuous under a low evening sun, by reason of its brilliant walls and\r\ninterior. In the region between Gauss and Berosus is a number of narrow\r\nsteep ridges which follow the curvature of the E. wall.\r\n\r\nSTRUVE.--A small irregularly-shaped formation, open towards the S.,\r\nforming one of the curious group of unsymmetrical enclosures associated\r\nwith Messala. Its dark floor and a small dusky area on the N. indicate\r\nits position under a high sun.\r\n\r\nCARRINGTON.--A small ring-plain, belonging to the Messala group,\r\nadjoining Schumacher on the N.W.\r\n\r\nMERCURIUS.--This formation is 25 miles in diameter. A small crater stands\r\non the S.E. section of the wall. There is a longitudinal range in the\r\ninterior, and on the W. and N.W. the remains of two large walled-plains,\r\nthe more westerly of which is a noteworthy object under suitable\r\nconditions. A short distance S. is a large, irregular, and very dark\r\nmarking. On the N., lies an immense bright plain, extending nearly to the\r\nborder of Endymion.\r\n\r\n\r\nWEST LONGITUDE 60 deg. TO 40 deg.\r\n\r\n\r\nTARUNTIUS.--Notwithstanding its comparatively low walls, this ring-plain,\r\n44 miles in diameter, is a very conspicuous object under a rising sun.\r\nLike Vitello and a few other formations, it has an inner ring on the\r\nfloor, concentric with the outer rampart, which I have often seen nearly\r\ncomplete under evening illumination. There is a small bright crater on\r\nthe S.E. wall, and a larger one on the crest of the N.E. wall, with a\r\nmuch more minute depression on the W. of it, the intervening space\r\nexhibiting signs of disturbance. The upper portion of the wall is very\r\nsteep, contrasting in this respect with the very gentle inclination of\r\nthe _glacis_, which on the S. extends to a distance of at least 30 miles\r\nbefore it sinks to the level of the surrounding country, the gradient\r\nprobably being as slight as 1 in 45. Two low dusky rings and a long\r\nnarrow valley with brilliant flanks are prominent objects on the plain E.\r\nof Taruntius under a low evening sun.\r\n\r\nSECCHI.--A partially enclosed little ring-plain S. of Taruntius, with a\r\nprominent central mountain and bright walls. There is a short cleft\r\nrunning in a N.E. direction from a point near the E. wall. Schmidt\r\nrepresents it as a row of inosculating craters.\r\n\r\nPICARD.--The largest of the craters on the surface of the Mare Crisium,\r\n21 miles in diameter. The floor, which includes a central mountain, is\r\ndepressed about 2000 feet below the outer surface, and is surrounded by\r\nwalls rising some 3000 feet above the Mare. A small but lofty ring-plain,\r\nPicard E, on the E., near the border of the Mare, is remarkable for its\r\nchange of aspect under different angles of illumination. A long curved\r\nridge running S. from this, with a lower ridge on the west, sometimes\r\nresemble a large enclosure with a central mountain. Still farther S.,\r\nthere is another bright deep crater, _a_, with a large low ring adjoining\r\nit on the S., abutting on the S.E. border of the Mare. Schroter bestowed\r\nmuch attention on these and other formations on the Mare Crisium, and\r\nattributed certain changes which he observed to a lunar atmosphere.\r\n\r\nPEIRCE.--This formation, smaller than Picard, is also prominent, its\r\nborder being very bright. There is a central peak, which, though not an\r\neasy object, I once glimpsed with a 4 inch Cook achromatic, and have seen\r\nit two or three times since with an 8 1/2 inch Calver reflector. A small\r\ncrater, detected by Schmidt, which I once saw very distinctly under\r\nevening illumination, stands on the floor at the foot of the W. wall.\r\nPeirce A, a deeper formation, lies a little N. of Peirce, and has also,\r\naccording to Neison, a very slight central hill, which is only just\r\nperceptible under the most favourable conditions. Schmidt appears to have\r\noverlooked it.\r\n\r\nPROCLUS.--One of the most brilliant objects on the moon's visible\r\nsurface, and hence extremely difficult to observe satisfactorily. It is\r\nabout 18 miles in diameter, with very steep walls, and, according to\r\nSchmidt, has a small crater on its east border, where Madler shows a\r\nbreak. It is questionable whether there is a central mountain. It is the\r\ncentre of a number of radiating light streaks which partly traverse the\r\nMare Crisium, and with those emanating from Picard, Peirce, and other\r\nobjects thereon, form a very complicated system.\r\n\r\nMACROBIUS.--This, with a companion ring on the W., is a very beautiful\r\nobject under a low sun. It is 42 miles in diameter, and is encircled by a\r\nbright, regular, but complex border, some 13,000 feet in height above the\r\nfloor. Its crest is broken on the E. by a large brilliant crater, and its\r\ncontinuity is interrupted on the N. by a formation resembling a large\r\ndouble crater, which is associated with a number of low rounded banks and\r\nridges extending some distance towards the N.W., and breaking the\r\ncontinuity of the _glacis_. The W. wall is much terraced, and on the N.W.\r\nincludes a row of prominent depressions, well seen when the interior is\r\nabout half illuminated under a rising sun. The central mountain is of the\r\ncompound type, but not at all prominent. The companion ring, Macrobius C,\r\nis terraced internally on the W., and the continuity of its N. border\r\nbroken by two depressions. There is a rill-valley between its N.E. side\r\nand Macrobius.\r\n\r\nCLEOMEDES.--A large oblong enclosure, 78 miles in diameter, with massive\r\nwalls, varying in altitude from 8000 to 10,000 feet above the interior.\r\nThe most noteworthy features in connection with the circumvallation are\r\nthe prominent depressions on the W. wall. Under a rising sun, when about\r\none-fourth of the floor is in shadow, three of these can be easily\r\ndistinguished, each resembling in form the analemma figure. There are two\r\nother curious depressions at the S.W. end of the formation. On the dark\r\nsteel-grey floor are two irregular dusky areas, and a narrow but bright\r\ncentral mountain, on which, according to Schmidt, stand two little\r\ncraters. There are two ring-plains on the S.W. quarter, and a group of\r\nthree associated craters on the N. side, one of which (A) Schroter\r\nbelieved came into existence after he commenced to observe the formation,\r\na supposition that has been shown by Birt and others to be very\r\nimprobable.\r\n\r\nTRALLES.--A large irregular crater, one of the deepest on the visible\r\nsurface of the moon, situated on the N.E. wall of Cleomedes. There is a\r\ncrater on its N. wall, and, according to Schmidt, some ridges and three\r\nclosely associated craters on the floor.\r\n\r\nBURCKHARDT.--This object, situated on an apparent extension of the W.\r\nwall of Cleomedes, is 35 miles in diameter, with a lofty border, rising\r\non the E. to an altitude of nearly 13,000 feet. It has a prominent\r\ncentral mountain and some low ridges on the floor, which, together with\r\ntwo minute craters on the S.W. wall, I have seen under a low angle of\r\nmorning illumination. It is flanked both on the E. and W. by deep\r\nirregular depressions, which present the appearance of having once been\r\ncomplete formations.\r\n\r\nGEMINUS.--A fine regular ring-plain, 54 miles in diameter, nearly\r\ncircular, with bright walls, rising on the E. to a height of more than\r\n12,000 feet, and on the opposite side to nearly 16,000 feet above the\r\nfloor. Their crest is everywhere very steep, and the inner slope is much\r\nterraced. There is a small but conspicuous mountain in the interior; N.\r\nof which I have seen a long ridge, where Schmidt shows some hillocks. Two\r\nfine clefts are easily visible within the ring, one running for some\r\ndistance on the S.E. side of the floor, mounting the inner slope of the\r\nS.W. border to the summit ridge (where it is apparently interrupted), and\r\nthen striking across the plain in a S.W. direction. Here it is\r\naccompanied for a short distance by a somewhat coarser companion, running\r\nparallel to it on the N. The other cleft occupies a very similar position\r\non the N.W. side of the floor at the inner foot of the wall. On several\r\noccasions, when observing this formation and the vicinity, I have been\r\nstruck by its peculiar colour under a low evening sun. At this time the\r\nwhole region appears to be of a warm light brown or sepia tone.\r\n\r\nBERNOUILLI.--A very deep ring-plain on the W. side of Geminus. Under\r\nevening illumination its lofty W. wall, which rises to a height of nearly\r\n13,000 feet above the floor, is conspicuously brilliant. This formation\r\nexhibits a marked departure from the circular type, being bounded by\r\nrectilineal sides. The inner slope of the W. wall is slightly terraced.\r\nThe border on the S. is much lower than elsewhere, as is evident when the\r\nformation is on the evening terminator. On the N. is the deep crater\r\nMessala _a_.\r\n\r\nNEWCOMB.--The most prominent of a group of formations standing in the\r\nmidst of the Haemus Mountains. Its crest is nearly 12,000 feet above the\r\nfloor, on which there are some hills.\r\n\r\nMESSALA.--This fine walled-plain, nearly 70 miles in diameter, is, with\r\nits surroundings, an especially interesting object when observed under a\r\nlow angle of illumination. Its complex border, though roughly circular,\r\ndisplays many irregularities in outline, due mainly to rows of\r\ndepressions. The best view of it is obtained when the W. wall is on the\r\nevening terminator. At this phase, if libration is favourable, the\r\nmanifold details of its very uneven and apparently convex floor are best\r\nseen. On the S.W. side is a group of large craters associated with a\r\nnumber of low hills, of which Schmidt shows five; but I have seen many\r\nmore, together with several ridges between them and the E. wall. I noted\r\nalso a cleft, or it may be a narrow valley, running from the foot of the\r\nN.W. wall towards the centre. On the floor, abutting on the N.E. border,\r\nis a semicircular ridge of considerable height, and beyond the border on\r\nthe N.E. there is another curved ridge, completing the circle, the wall\r\nforming the diameter. This formation is clearly of more ancient date than\r\nMessala, as the N.E. wall of the latter has cut through it. Where Messala\r\njoins Schumacher there is a break in the border, occupied by three deep\r\ndepressions.\r\n\r\nSCHUMACHER.--A large irregular ring-plain, 28 miles in diameter,\r\nassociated with the N. wall of Messala, and having other smaller rings\r\nadjoining it on the E. and N. The interior seems to be devoid of detail.\r\n\r\nHOOKE.--Another irregular ring-plain, 28 miles in diameter, on the N.E.\r\nof Messala. There is a bright crater of considerable size on the S.W.,\r\nwhich is said to be more than 6000 feet in depth, and, according to\r\nNeison, is visible as a white spot at full. There is a smaller crater on\r\nthe slope of the N.W. wall.\r\n\r\nSHUCKBURGH.--A square-shaped enclosure on the N. of the last, with a\r\ncomparatively low border. It has a conspicuous crater at its N.W. corner.\r\n\r\nBERZELIUS.--A considerable ring-plain of regular form, with low walls and\r\ndark interior, on which there is a central peak, difficult to detect.\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN.--A ring-plain, 33 miles in diameter, which displays a\r\nconsiderable departure from the circular type, as the border is in great\r\npart made up of rectilineal sections. Both the W. and N.E. wall is much\r\nterraced, and rises about 8000 feet above the dark floor, on the S. part\r\nof which there is a long ridge. There is a bright little isolated\r\nmountain on the plain E. of the formation, and a conspicuous craterlet on\r\nthe N.W. An incomplete ring, with a very attenuated border, abuts on the\r\nS. side of Franklin.\r\n\r\nCEPHEUS.--A peculiarly shaped ring-plain, 27 miles in diameter. The E.\r\nborder is nearly rectilineal, while on the W., the wall forms a bold\r\ncurve. There is a very brilliant crater on the summit of this section,\r\nand a central mountain on the floor. The W. wall is much terraced. W. of\r\nCepheus, close to the brilliant crater, there is a cleft or narrow valley\r\nrunning N. towards Oersted.\r\n\r\nOERSTED.--An oblong formation with very low walls, scarcely traceable on\r\nthe S.E., except when near the terminator. There is a conspicuous crater\r\non the N.W. side of the floor, and a curious square enclosure, with a\r\ncrater on its W. border, abutting on the N.E. wall.\r\n\r\nCHEVALLIER.--An inconspicuous object enclosed by slightly curved ridges.\r\nIt includes a deep bright crater. On the N. is a low square formation and\r\na long ridge running N. from it. Just beyond the N.E. wall is the fine\r\nlarge crater, Atlas A, with a much smaller but equally conspicuous crater\r\nbeyond. A has a central hill, which, in spite of the bright interior, is\r\nnot a difficult feature.\r\n\r\nATLAS.--This, and its companion Hercules on the E., form under oblique\r\nillumination a very beautiful pair, scarcely surpassed by any other\r\nsimilar objects on the first quadrant. Its lofty rampart, 55 miles in\r\ndiameter, is surmounted by peaks, which on the N. tower to an altitude of\r\nnearly 11,000 feet. It exhibits an approach to a polygonal outline, the\r\nlineal character of the border being especially well marked on the N. The\r\ndetail on the somewhat dark interior will repay careful scrutiny with\r\nhigh powers. There is a small but distinct central mountain, south of\r\nwhich stands a number of smaller hills, forming with the first a circular\r\narrangement, suggestive of the idea that they represent the relics of a\r\nlarge central crater. Several clefts may be seen on the floor under\r\nsuitable illumination, among them a forked cleft on the N.E. quarter, and\r\ntwo others, originating at a dusky pit of irregular form situated near\r\nthe foot of the S.E. wall, one of which runs W. of the central hills, and\r\nthe other on the opposite side. A ridge, at times resembling a light\r\nmarking, extends from the central mountain to the N. border. During the\r\nyears 1870 and 1871 I bestowed some attention on the dusky pit, and was\r\nled to suspect that both it and the surrounding area vary considerably in\r\ntone from time to time. Professor W.H. Pickering, observing the formation\r\nin 1891 with a 13 inch telescope under the favourable atmospheric\r\nconditions which prevail at Arequipa, Peru, confirmed this supposition,\r\nand has discovered some very interesting and suggestive facts relating to\r\nthese variations, which, it is hoped, will soon be made public. On the\r\nplain a short distance beyond the foot of the _glacis_ of the S.E. wall,\r\nI have frequently noted a second dusky spot, from which proceeds, towards\r\nthe E., a long rill-like marking. On the N. there is a large formation\r\nenclosed by rectilineal ridges. The outer slopes of the rampart of Atlas\r\nare very noteworthy under a low sun.\r\n\r\nHERCULES.--The eastern companion of Atlas, a fine ring-plain, about 46\r\nmiles in diameter, with a complex border, rising some 11,000 feet above a\r\ndepressed floor. There are few formations of its class and size which\r\ndisplay so much detail in the shape of terraces, apparent landslips, and\r\nvariation in brightness. In the interior, S.E. of the centre, is a very\r\nconspicuous crater, which is visible as a bright spot when the formation\r\nitself is hardly traceable, two large craterlets slightly N. of the\r\ncentre, and several faint little spots on the east of them. The latter,\r\ndetected some years ago by Herr Hackel of Stuttgart, are arranged in the\r\nform of a horse-shoe. There are two small contiguous craters on the S.E.\r\nwall, one of which, a difficult object, was recently detected by Mr. W.H.\r\nMaw, F.R.A.S. The well-known wedge-shaped protuberance on the S. wall is\r\ndue to a large irregular depression. On the bright inner slope of the N.\r\nwall are manifest indications of a landslip.\r\n\r\nENDYMION.--A large walled-plain, 78 miles in diameter, enclosed by a\r\nlofty, broad, bright border, surmounted in places by peaks which attain a\r\nheight of more than 10,000 feet above the interior, one on the W.\r\nmeasuring more than 15,000 feet. The walls are much terraced and exhibit\r\ntwo or three breaks. The dark floor appears to be devoid of detail.\r\nSchmidt, however, draws two large irregular mounds E. of the centre, and\r\nshows four narrow light streaks crossing the interior nearly parallel to\r\nthe longer axis of the formation.\r\n\r\nDE LA RUE.--Notwithstanding its great extent, this formation hardly\r\ndeserves a distinctive name, as from the lowness of its border it is\r\nscarcely traceable in its entirety except under very oblique light.\r\nSchmidt, nevertheless, draws it with very definite walls, and shows\r\nseveral ridges and small rings in the interior. Among these objects, a\r\nlittle E. of the centre, there is a prominent peak.\r\n\r\nSTRABO.--A small walled-plain, 32 miles in diameter, connected with the\r\nN. border of the last.\r\n\r\nTHALES.--A bright formation, also associated with the N. side of De la\r\nRue, adjoining Strabo on the N.E. Schmidt shows a minute hill in the\r\ninterior.\r\n\r\nThere are several unnamed formations, large and small, between De la Rue\r\nand the limb, some of which are well worthy of examination.\r\n\r\n\r\nWEST LONGITUDE 40 deg. TO 20  deg.\r\n\r\n\r\nMASKELYNE.--A regular ring-plain, 19 miles in diameter, standing almost\r\nisolated in the Mare Tranquilitatis. The floor, which includes a central\r\nmountain, is depressed some 3000 feet below the surrounding surface.\r\nThere are prominent terraces on the inner slope of the walls. Schmidt\r\nshows no craters upon them, but Madler draws a small one on the E., the\r\nexistence of which I can confirm.\r\n\r\nMANNERS.--A brilliant little ring-plain, 11 miles in diameter, on the\r\nS.E. side of the Mare Tranquilitatis. There appears to be no detail\r\nwhatever in connection with its wall. It has a distinct central mountain.\r\nAbout three diameters distant on the S.W. there is a bright crater,\r\nomitted by Madler and Neison.\r\n\r\nARAGO.--A much larger formation, 18 miles in diameter, N. of the last,\r\nwith a small crater on its N. border, and exhibiting two or three spurs\r\nfrom the wall on the opposite side. The inner slopes are terraced, and\r\nthere is a small central mountain. There are two curious circular\r\nprotuberances on the Mare E. of Arago, which are well seen when the W.\r\nlongitude of the morning terminator is about 19 deg., and a long cleft,\r\npassing about midway between them, and extending from the foot of the E.\r\nwall to a small crater on the edge of the Mare near Sosigenes. Another\r\ncleft, also terminating at this crater, runs towards Arago and the more\r\nnortherly of the protuberances.\r\n\r\nCAUCHY.--A bright little crater, not more than 7 or 8 miles in diameter,\r\non the W. side of the Mare Tranquilitatis, N.E. of Taruntius. It has a\r\npeak on its W. rim considerably loftier than the rest of the wall, which\r\nis visible as a brilliant spot at sunrise long before the rest of the\r\nrampart is illuminated. On the S. there are two bright longitudinal\r\nridges ranging from N.E. to S.W. These stand in the position where Neison\r\ndraws two straight clefts. The Cauchy cleft, however, lies N. of these,\r\nand terminates, as shown by Schmidt, among the mountains N.E. of\r\nTaruntius. I have seen it thus on many occasions, and it is so\r\nrepresented in a drawing by M.E. Stuvaert (_Dessins de la Lune_). There\r\nis a number of minute craters and mounds standing on the S. side of this\r\ncleft, and many others in the vicinity.\r\n\r\nJANSEN.--Owing to its comparatively low border, this is not a very\r\nconspicuous object. It is chiefly remarkable for the curious arrangement\r\nof the mountains and ridges on the S. and W. of it. There is a bright\r\nlittle crater on the S. side of the floor, and many noteworthy objects of\r\nthe same class in the neighbourhood. The mountain arm running S., and\r\nultimately bending E., forms a large incomplete hook-shaped formation\r\nterminating at a ring-plain, Jansen B. The ridges in the Mare\r\nTranquilitatis between Jansen B. and the region E. of Maskelyne display\r\nunder a low sun foldings and wrinklings of a very extraordinary kind.\r\n\r\nMACLEAR.--A conspicuous ring-plain about 16 miles in diameter. The dark\r\nfloor includes, according to Madler, a delicate central hill which\r\nSchmidt does not show. Neison, however, saw a faint greyish mark, and an\r\nundoubted peak has been subsequently recorded. I have not succeeded in\r\nseeing any detail within the border, which in shape resembles a triangle\r\nwith curved sides.\r\n\r\nROSS.--A somewhat larger ring-plain of irregular form, on the N.W. of the\r\nlast. There are gaps on the bright S.W. border and a crater on the S.E.\r\nwall. The central mountain is an easy feature.\r\n\r\nPLINIUS.--This magnificent object reminds one at sunrise of a great\r\nfortress or redoubt erected to command the passage between the Mare\r\nTranquilitatis and the Mare Serenitatis. It is 32 miles in diameter, and\r\nis encompassed by a very massive rampart, rising at one peak on the E. to\r\nmore than 6000 feet above the interior, and displaying, especially on the\r\nS.E., and N., many spurs and buttresses. The exterior slopes at sunrise,\r\nand even when the sun is more than 10 deg. above the horizon, are seen to\r\nbe traversed by wide and deep valleys. The S. _glacis_ is especially\r\nbroad, extending to a distance of 10 or 12 miles before it runs down to\r\nthe level of the plain. The shape of the circumvallation, when it is\r\nfully illuminated, approximates very closely to that of an equilateral\r\ntriangle with curved sides. There are two bright little craters on the\r\nouter slope, just below the summit ridge on the S.E., and another,\r\nlarger, on the N. wall, in which it makes a prominent gap. The interior\r\nis considerably brighter than the surface of the surrounding Mare, and, a\r\nlittle S. of the centre, includes two crater-like objects with broken\r\nrims. These assume different aspects under different conditions of\r\nillumination, and it is only when the floor is lighted by a comparatively\r\nlow morning sun, that their true character is apparent. On the N.W.\r\nquarter of the interior are two smaller distinct craters, and a square\r\narrangement of ridges. On the N.E. there are some hillocks and minor\r\nelevations. The Plinius rills form an especially interesting system, and\r\nunder favourable conditions may be seen in their entirety with a good 4\r\ninch refractor, about the time when the morning terminator passes through\r\nJulius Caesar. They consist of three long fissures, originating amid the\r\nHaemus highlands, on the S. side of the Mare Serenitatis, and diverging\r\ntowards the W. The most southerly commences S.S.E. of the Acherusian\r\npromontory (a great headland, 5000 feet high, at the W. termination of\r\nthe Haemus range), and, following a somewhat undulating course, runs up\r\nto the N. side of Dawes. Under a low evening sun, I have remarked many\r\ninequalities in the width of that portion of it immediately N. of\r\nPlinius, which appear to indicate that it is here made up of rows of\r\ninosculating craters. The cleft north of this originates very near it,\r\npasses a little S. of the promontory, and runs to the E. edge of the\r\nplateau surrounding Dawes. The third and most northerly cleft begins at a\r\npoint immediately N. of the promontory, cuts through the S. end of the\r\nwell-known Serpentine ridge on the Mare Serenitatis, and, after following\r\na course slightly concave to the N., dies out on the N. side of the\r\nplateau. This cleft forms the line of demarcation between the dark tone\r\nof the Mare Serenitatis and the light hue of the Mare Tranquilitatis,\r\ntraceable under nearly every condition of illumination, and prominent in\r\nall good photographs.\r\n\r\nDAWES.--A ring-plain 14 miles in diameter, situated N.W. of Plinius, on a\r\nnearly circular light area. Its bright border rises to a height of 2000\r\nfeet above the Mare, and includes a central mountain, a white marking on\r\nthe E., and a ridge running from the mountain to the S. wall. There are\r\ntwo closely parallel clefts on the N. side of the plateau running from E.\r\nto W., that nearer Dawes being the longer, and having a craterlet\r\nstanding upon it about midway between its extremities. At its W.\r\ntermination there is a crater-row running at right angles to it. The\r\nlight area appears to be bounded on the E. by a low curved bank.\r\n\r\nVITRUVIUS.--A ring-plain 19 miles in diameter with bright but not very\r\nlofty walls, situated among the mountains near the S.W. side of the Mare\r\nSerenitatis. It is surrounded by a region remarkable for its great\r\nvariability in brightness. There is a large bright ring-plain on the W.,\r\nwith a less conspicuous companion on the S. of it.\r\n\r\nMARALDI.--A deep but rather inconspicuous formation, bounded on the W. by\r\na polygonal border. A small ring-plain with a central mountain is\r\nconnected with the S.W. wall; and, running in a N. direction from this,\r\nis a short mountain arm which joins a large circular enclosure with a low\r\nbroken border standing on the N. side of the Mare Tranquilitatis.\r\n\r\nLITTROW.--A peculiar ring-plain, rather smaller than the last, some\r\ndistance N. of Vitruvius, on the rocky W. border of the Mare Serenitatis.\r\nIt is shaped like the letter D, the straight side facing the W. There is\r\na distinct crater on the N. wall. On the N.W. it is flanked by three\r\nirregular ring-plains, and on the S.E. by a fourth. Neison shows two\r\nsmall mountains on the floor, but Schmidt, whose drawing is very true to\r\nnature, has no detail whatever. A fine cleft may be traced from near the\r\nfoot of the E. wall to Mount Argaeus, passing S. of a bright crater on\r\nthe Mare E. of Littrow. It extends towards the Plinius system, and is\r\nprobably connected with it.\r\n\r\nMOUNT ARGAEUS.--There are few objects on the moon's visible surface which\r\nafford a more striking and beautiful picture than this mountain and its\r\nsurrounding heights with their shadows a few hours after sunrise. It\r\nattains an altitude of more than 8000 feet above the Mare, and at a\r\ncertain phase resembles a bright spear-head or dagger. There is a well-\r\ndefined rimmed depression abutting on its southern point.\r\n\r\nROMER.--A prominent formation of irregular outline, 24 miles in diameter,\r\nsituated in the midst of the Taurus highlands. It has a very large\r\ncentral mountain, a crater on the N. side of the floor, and terraced\r\ninner slopes. Some distance on the N. is another ring, nearly as large,\r\nwith a crater on its S. rim, and between this and Posidonius is another\r\nwith a wide gap on the S. and a crater on its N. border. One of the most\r\nremarkable crater-rills on the moon runs from the E. side of Romer\r\nthrough this latter ring, and then northwards on to the plain W. of\r\nPosidonius. Under suitable conditions, it can be seen as such in a 4 inch\r\nachromatic. It is easily traceable as a rill in a photograph of the N.\r\npolar region of the moon taken by MM. Henry at the Paris Observatory, and\r\nrecently published in _Knowledge_.\r\n\r\nLE MONNIER.--A great inflection or bay on the W. border of the Mare\r\nSerenitatis S. of Posidonius. Like many other similar formations on the\r\nedges of the Maria, it appears at one time or other to have had a\r\ncontinuous rampart, which on the side facing the \"sea\" has been\r\ndestroyed. In this, as in most of the other cases, relics of the ruin are\r\ntraceable under oblique light. A fine crescent-shaped mountain, 3000 feet\r\nhigh, stands near the S. side of the gap, and probably represents a\r\nportion of a once lofty wall. It will repay the observer to watch the\r\nprogress of sunrise on the whole of the W. coast-line of the Mare up to\r\nMount Argaeus.\r\n\r\nPOSIDONIUS.--This magnificent ring-plain is justly regarded as one of the\r\nfinest telescopic objects in the first quadrant. Its narrow bright wall\r\nwith its serrated shadow, the conspicuous crater, the clefts and ridges\r\nand other details on the floor, together with the beautiful group of\r\nobjects on the neighbouring plain, and the great Serpentine ridge on the\r\nE., never fail to excite the interest of the observer. The\r\ncircumvallation, which is far from being perfectly regular, is about 62\r\nmiles in diameter, and, considering its size, is not remarkable for its\r\naltitude, as it nowhere exceeds 6000 feet above the interior, which is\r\ndepressed about 2000 feet below the surrounding plain. Its continuity,\r\nespecially on the E., is interrupted by gaps. On the N., the wall is\r\nnotably deformed. It is broader and more regular on the W., where it\r\nincludes a large longitudinal depression, and on the N.W. section stand\r\ntwo bright little ring-plains. On the floor, which shines with a\r\nglittering lustre, are the well-marked remains of a second ring, nearly\r\nconcentric with the principal rampart, and separated from it by an\r\ninterval of nine or ten miles. The most prominent object, however, is the\r\nbright crater a little E. of the centre. This is partially surrounded on\r\nthe W. by three or four small bright mountains, through which runs in a\r\nmeridional direction a rill-valley, not easily traced as a whole, except\r\nunder a low sun. There is another cleft on the N.E. side of the interior,\r\nwhich is an apparent extension of part of the inner ring, a transverse\r\nrill-valley on the N., a fourth _quasi_ rill on the N.W., and a fifth\r\nshort cleft on the S. part of the floor. Between the principal crater and\r\nthe S.E. wall are two smaller craters, which are easy objects. Beyond the\r\nborder on the N., in addition to Daniell, are four conspicuous craters\r\nand many ridges.\r\n\r\nCHACORNAC.--This object, connected with Posidonius on the S.W., is\r\nremarkable for the brilliancy of its border and the peculiarity of its\r\nshape, which is very clearly that of an irregular pentagon with linear\r\nsides. I always find the detail within very difficult to make out. Two or\r\nmore low ridges, traversing the floor from N. to S., and a small crater,\r\nare, however, clearly visible under oblique illumination. Schmidt draws a\r\ncrater-rill, and Neison two parallel rills on the floor,--the former\r\nextends in a southerly direction to the W. side of Le Monnier.\r\n\r\nDANIELL.--A bright little ring-plain N. of Posidonius. It is connected\r\nwith a smaller ring-plain on the N.W. wall of the latter by a low ridge.\r\n\r\nBOND, G.P.--A small bright ring-plain 12 miles in diameter, W. of\r\nPosidonius. Neison shows a crater both on the N. and S. rim. Schmidt\r\nomits these.\r\n\r\nMAURY.--A bright deep little ring-plain, about 12 miles in diameter, on\r\nthe W. border of the Lacus Somniorum. It is the centre of four prominent\r\nhill ranges.\r\n\r\nGROVE.--A bright deep ring-plain, 15 miles in diameter, in the Lacus\r\nSomniorum, with a border rising 7000 feet above a greatly depressed\r\nfloor, which includes a prominent mountain.\r\n\r\nMASON.--The more westerly of two remarkable ring-plains, situated in the\r\nhighlands on the S. side of the Lacus Mortis. It is 14 miles in diameter,\r\nhas a distinct crater on its S. wall, and, according to Schmidt, a crater\r\non the E. side of the floor.\r\n\r\nPLANA.--A formation 23 miles in diameter, closely associated with the\r\nlast. Neison states that the floor is convex and higher than the\r\nsurrounding region. It has a triangular-shaped central mountain, a\r\ncrater, and at least three other depressions on the S.W. wall where it\r\njoins Mason.\r\n\r\nBURG.--A noteworthy formation, 28 miles in diameter, on the Mare, N. of\r\nPlana. The floor is concave, and includes a very large bright mountain,\r\nwhich occupies a great portion of it. The interior slopes are prominently\r\nterraced, and there are several spurs associated with the _glacis_ on the\r\nS. and N.E. A distinct cleft runs from the N. side of the formation to\r\nthe S.E. border of the Lacus Somniorum, which is crossed by another\r\nwinding cleft running from a crater E. of Plana towards the N.E.\r\n\r\nBAILY.--A small ring-plain, N. of Burg, flanked by mountains, with a\r\nlarge bright crater on the W. The group of mountains standing about\r\nmidway between it and Burg are very noteworthy.\r\n\r\nGARTNER.--A very large walled-plain with a low incomplete border on the\r\nE., but defined on the W. by a lofty wall. Schmidt shows a curved crater-\r\nrow on the W. side of the floor.\r\n\r\nDEMOCRITUS.--A deep regular ring-plain, about 25 miles in diameter, with\r\na bright central mountain and lofty terraced walls.\r\n\r\nARNOLD.--A great enclosure, bounded, like so many other formations\r\nhereabouts, by straight parallel walls. There is a somewhat smaller\r\nwalled-plain adjoining it on the W.\r\n\r\nMOIGNO.--A ring-plain with a dark floor, adjoining the last on the N.E.\r\nThere is a conspicuous little crater in the interior.\r\n\r\nEUCTEMON.--This object is so close to the limb that very little can be\r\nmade of its details under the most favourable conditions. According to\r\nNeison, there is a peak on the N. wall 11,000 feet in height.\r\n\r\nMETON.--A peculiarly-shaped walled-plain of great size, exhibiting\r\nconsiderable parallelism. The floor is seen to be very rugged under\r\noblique illumination.\r\n\r\n\r\nWEST LONGITUDE 20 deg. TO 0  deg.\r\n\r\n\r\nSABINE.--The more westerly of a remarkable pair of ring-plains, of which\r\nRitter is the other member, situated on the E. side of the Mare\r\nTranquilitatis a little N. of the lunar equator. It is about 18 miles in\r\ndiameter, and has a low continuous border, which includes a central\r\nmountain on a bright floor. From a mountain arm extending from the S.\r\nwall, run in a westerly direction two nearly parallel clefts skirting the\r\nedge of the Mare. The more southerly of these terminates near a\r\ndepression on a rocky headland projecting from the coast-line, and the\r\nother stops a few miles short of this. A third cleft, commencing at a\r\npoint N.E. of the headland, runs in the same direction up to a small\r\ncrater near the N. end of another cape-like projection. At 8 h. on April\r\n9, 1886, when the morning terminator bisected Sabine, I traced it still\r\nfarther in the same direction. All these clefts exhibit considerable\r\nvariations in width, but become narrower as they proceed westwards.\r\n\r\nRITTER.--Is very similar in every respect to the last. A curved rill\r\nmentioned by Neison is on the N.E. side of the floor and is concentric\r\nwith the wall. On the N. side of this ring-plain are three conspicuous\r\ncraters, the two nearer being equal in size and the third much smaller.\r\n\r\nSCHMIDT.--A bright crater at the foot of the S. slope of Ritter.\r\n\r\nDIONYSIUS.--This crater, 13 miles in diameter, is one of the brightest\r\nspots on the lunar surface. It stands on the E. border of the Mare, about\r\n30 miles E.N.E. of Ritter. A distinct crater-row runs round its outer\r\nborder on the W., and ultimately, as a delicate cleft, strikes across the\r\nMare to the E. side of Ritter. Both crater-row and cleft are easy objects\r\nin a 4 inch achromatic under morning illumination.\r\n\r\nARIADAEUS.--A bright little crater of polygonal shape, with another\r\ncrater of about one-third the area adjoining it on the N.W., situated on\r\nthe rocky E. margin of the Mare Tranquilitatis, N.E. of Ritter. A short\r\ncleft runs from it towards the latter, but dies out about midway. A\r\nsecond cleft begins near its termination, and runs up to the N.E. wall of\r\nRitter. E. of this pair a third distinct cleft, originating at a point on\r\nthe coast-line about midway between Ariadaeus and Dionysius, ends near\r\nthe same place on the border. There is a fourth cleft extending from the\r\nN. side of a little bay N. of Ariadaeus across the Mare to a point N.W.\r\nof the more northerly of the three craters N. of Ritter. At a small\r\ncrater on the S. flank of the mountains bordering the little bay N. of\r\nAriadaeus originates one of the longest and most noteworthy clefts on the\r\nmoon's visible surface, discovered more than a century ago by Schroter of\r\nLilienthal. It varies considerably in breadth and depth, but throughout\r\nits course over the plain, between Ariadaeus and Silberschlag, it can be\r\nfollowed without difficulty in a very small telescope. E. of the latter\r\nformation, towards Hyginus (with which rill-system it is connected), it\r\nis generally more difficult. A few miles E. of Ariadaeus it sends out a\r\nshort branch, running in a S.W. direction, which can be traced as a fine\r\nwhite line under a moderately high sun. It is interesting to follow the\r\ncourse of the principal cleft across the plain, and to note its progress\r\nthrough the ridges and mountain groups it encounters. In the great Lick\r\ntelescope it is seen to traverse some old crater-rings which have not\r\nbeen revealed in smaller instruments. About midway between Ariadaeus and\r\nSilberschlag it exhibits a duplication for a short distance, first\r\ndetected by Webb.\r\n\r\nDE MORGAN.--A brilliant little crater, 4 miles in diameter, on the plain\r\nS. of the Ariadaeus cleft.\r\n\r\nCAYLEY.--A very deep bright crater, with a dark interior, N. of the last,\r\nand more than double its diameter. There is a second crater between this\r\nand the cleft.\r\n\r\nWHEWELL.--Another bright little ring, about 3 miles in diameter, some\r\ndistance to the E. of De Morgan and Cayley.\r\n\r\nSOSIGENES.--A small circular ring-plain, 14 miles in diameter, with\r\nnarrow walls, a central mountain, and a minute crater outside the wall on\r\nthe E.; situated on the E. side of the Mare Tranquilitatis, W. of Julius\r\nCaesar. There is another crater, about half its diameter, on the S.,\r\nconnected with it by a low mound. This has a still smaller crater on the\r\nW. of it.\r\n\r\nJULIUS CAESAR.--A large incomplete formation of irregular shape. The wall\r\non the E. is much terraced, and forms a flat \"S\" curve. The summit ridge\r\nis especially bright, and has a conspicuous little crater upon it. On\r\nthe W. is a number of narrow longitudinal valleys trending from N. to S.,\r\nincluded by a wide valley which constitutes the boundary on this side.\r\nThe border on the S. consists of a number of low rounded banks, those\r\nimmediately E. of Sosigenes being traversed by several shallow valleys,\r\nwhich look as if they had been shaped by alluvial action. There is a\r\nbrilliant little hill at the end of one of these valleys, a few miles E.\r\nof Sosigenes. The floor of Julius Caesar is uneven in tone, becoming\r\ngradually duskier from S. to N., the northern end ranking among the\r\ndarkest areas on the lunar surface. There are at least three large\r\ncircular swellings in the interior. A long low mound, with two or three\r\ndepressions upon it, bounds the wide valley on the E. side.\r\n\r\nGODIN.--A square-shaped ring-plain, 28 miles in diameter, with rounded\r\ncorners. The bright rampart is everywhere lofty, except on the S., is\r\nmuch terraced, and includes a central mountain. On the S. a curious\r\ntrumpet-shaped valley, extending some distance towards the S.W., and\r\nbounded by bright walls, is a noteworthy feature at sunrise. There are\r\nother longitudinal valleys with associated ridges on this side of the\r\nformation, all running in the same direction. There is a large bright\r\ncrater outside the border on the N.E., and, between it and the wall,\r\nanother, smaller, which is readily seen under a high sun.\r\n\r\nAGRIPPA.--A ring-plain 28 miles in diameter on the N. of the last, with a\r\nterraced border rising to a height of between 7000 and 8000 feet above\r\nthe floor, which contains a large bright central mountain and two craters\r\non the S. The shape of this formation deviates very considerably from\r\ncircularity, the N. wall, on which stands a small crater, being almost\r\nlineal. On the W., at a distance of a few miles, runs the prominent\r\nmountain range, extending northwards nearly up to the E. flank of Julius\r\nCaesar, which bounds the E. side of the great Ariadaeus plain. Between\r\nthis rocky barrier and Agrippa is a very noteworthy enclosure containing\r\nmuch minute detail and a long straight ridge resembling a cleft. A few\r\nmiles N. of Agrippa stands a small crater; at a point W. of which the\r\nHyginus cleft originates.\r\n\r\nSILBERSCHLAG.--A very brilliant crater, 8 or 9 miles in diameter,\r\nconnected with the great mountain range just referred to. The Ariadaeus\r\ncleft cuts through the range a few miles N. of it. This neighbourhood at\r\nsunrise presents a grand spectacle. With high powers under good\r\natmospheric conditions, the plain E. of the mountains is seen to be\r\ntraversed by a number of shallow winding valleys, trending towards\r\nAgrippa, and separated by low rounded hills which have all the appearance\r\nof having been moulded by the action of water.\r\n\r\nBOSCOVICH.--This is not a very striking telescopic object under any\r\nphase, on account of its broken, irregular, and generally ill-defined\r\nborder. It is, however, remarkable as being one of the darkest spots on\r\nthe visible surface: in this respect a fit companion to Julius Caesar,\r\nits neighbour on the W. Schmidt shows some ridges within it.\r\n\r\nRHAETICUS.--A very interesting formation, about 25 miles in diameter,\r\nsituated near the lunar equator, with a border intersected by many\r\npasses. A deep rill-like valley winds round its eastern _glacis_,\r\ncommencing on the S. at a small circular enclosure standing at the end of\r\na spur from the wall; and, after crossing a ridge W. of a bright little\r\ncrater on the N. of the formation, apparently joins the most easterly\r\ncleft of the Triesnecker system. A cleft traverses the N. side of the\r\nfloor of Rhaeticus, and extends across the plain on the E. as far as the\r\nN. side of Reaumur.\r\n\r\nTRIESNECKER.--Apart from being the centre of one of the most remarkable\r\nrill-systems on the moon, this ring-plain, though only about 14 miles in\r\ndiameter, is an object especially worthy of examination under every\r\nphase. At sunrise, and for some time afterwards, owing to the superior\r\naltitude of the N.W. section of the wall, a considerable portion of the\r\nborder on the N. and N.E. is masked by its shadow, which thus appears to\r\ndestroy its continuity. On more than one occasion, friends, to whom I\r\nhave shown this object under these conditions, have likened it to a\r\nbreached volcanic cone, a comparison which at a later stage is seen to be\r\nvery inappropriate. The rampart is terraced within, and exhibits many\r\nspurs and buttresses without, especially on the N.W. The central mountain\r\nis small and not conspicuous. The rill-system is far too complicated to\r\nbe intelligibly described in words. It lies on the W. side of the\r\nmeridian passing through the formation, and extends from the N. side of\r\nRhaeticus to the mountain-land lying between Ukert and Hyginus on the N.\r\nBirt likened these rills to \"an inverted river system,\" a comparison\r\nwhich will commend itself to most observers who have seen them on a good\r\nnight, for in many instances they appear to become wider and deeper as\r\nthey approach higher ground. Published maps are all more or less\r\ndefective in their representations of them, especially as regards that\r\nportion of the system lying N. of Triesnecker.\r\n\r\nHYGINUS.--A deep depression, rather less than 4 miles across, with a low\r\nrim of varying altitude, having a crater on its N. edge. This formation\r\nis remarkable for the great cleft which traverses it, discovered by\r\nSchroter in 1788. The coarser parts of this object are easily visible in\r\nsmall telescopes, and may be glimpsed under suitable conditions with a 2\r\ninch achromatic. Commencing a little W. of a small crater N. of Agrippa,\r\nit crosses, as a very delicate object, a plain abounding in low ridges\r\nand shallow valleys, and runs nearly parallel to the eastern extension of\r\nthe Ariadaeus rill. As it approaches Hyginus it becomes gradually\r\ncoarser, and exhibits many expansions and contractions, the former in\r\nmany cases evidently representing craters. When the phase is favourable,\r\nit can be followed across the floor of Hyginus, and I have frequently\r\nseen the banks with which it appears to be bounded (at any rate within\r\nthe formation), standing out as fine bright parallel lines amid the\r\nshadow. On reaching the E. wall, it turns somewhat more to the N.,\r\nbecomes still coarser and more irregular in breadth, and ultimately\r\nexpands into a wide valley on the N.E. It is connected with the Ariadaeus\r\ncleft by a branch which leaves the latter at an acute angle on the plain\r\nE. of Silberschlag, and joins it about midway between its origin N. of\r\nAgrippa and Hyginus. It is also probably joined to the Triesnecker system\r\nby one or more branches E. of Hyginus.\r\n\r\nOn May 27, 1877, Dr. Hermann Klein of Cologne discovered, with a 5 1/2\r\ninch Plosel dialyte telescope, a dark apparent depression without a rim\r\nin the Mare Vaporum, a few miles N.W. of Hyginus, which, from twelve\r\nyears' acquaintance with the region, he was certain had not been visible\r\nduring that period. On the announcement of this discovery in the\r\n_Wochenschrift fur Astronomie_ in March of the following year, the\r\nexistence of the object described by Dr. Klein was confirmed, and it was\r\nsedulously scrutinised under various solar altitudes. To most observers\r\nit appeared as an ill-defined object with a somewhat nebulous border,\r\nstanding on an irregularly-shaped dusky area, with two or more small dark\r\ncraters and many low ridges in its vicinity. A little E. of it stands a\r\ncurious spiral mountain called the Schneckenberg. The question as to\r\nwhether Hyginus N. (as the dusky spot is called) is a new object or not,\r\ncannot be definitely determined, as, in spite of a strong case in favour\r\nof it being so, there remains a residuum of doubt and uncertainty that\r\ncan never be entirely cleared away. After weighing, however, all that can\r\nbe said \"for and against,\" the hypothesis of change seems to be the most\r\nprobable.\r\n\r\nUKERT.--This bright crater, 14 miles in diameter, situated in the region\r\nN.E. of Triesnecker, is surrounded by a very complicated arrangement of\r\nmountains; and on the N. and W. is flanked by other enclosures. It has a\r\ndistinct central mountain. Its most noteworthy feature is the great\r\nvalley, more than 80 miles long, which extends from N.E. to S.W. on the\r\nE. side of it. This gorge is at least six miles in breadth, of great\r\ndepth, and is only comparable in magnitude with the well-known valley\r\nwhich cuts through the Alps, W. of Plato. A delicate cleft, not very\r\nclearly traceable as a whole, begins near its N. end, and terminates amid\r\nthe ramifications of the Apennines S. of Marco Polo.\r\n\r\nTAQUET.--A conspicuous little crater on the S. border of the Mare\r\nSerenitatis at the foot of the Haemus Mountains. A branch of the great\r\nSerpentine ridge, which traverses the W. side of this plain and other\r\nlesser elevations, runs towards it.\r\n\r\nMENELAUS.--A conspicuously bright regular ring-plain, about 20 miles in\r\ndiameter, situated on the S. coast-line of the Mare Serenitatis, and\r\nclosely associated with the Haemus range. It has a brilliant central\r\nmountain, but no visible detail on the walls. On the edge of the Mare,\r\nS.W. of it, there is a curious square formation. The bright streak\r\ntraversing the Mare from N. to S., which is so prominently displayed in\r\nold maps of the moon, passes through this formation.\r\n\r\nSULPICIUS GALLUS.--Another brilliant object on the south edge of the Mare\r\nSerenitatis, some distance E. of the last. It is a deep circular crater\r\nabout 8 miles in diameter, rising to a considerable height above the\r\nsurface. Its shadow under a low morning sun is prominently jagged. On the\r\nE. are two bright mounds, and S. of that which is nearer the border of\r\nthe Mare, commences a cleft which, following the curvature of the coast-\r\nline, terminates at a point in W. long. 9 deg. This object varies\r\nconsiderably in width and depth. Another shorter and coarser cleft runs\r\nS. of this across an irregularly shaped bay or inflexion in the border of\r\nthe Mare.\r\n\r\nMANILIUS.--This, one of the most brilliant objects in the first quadrant,\r\nis about 25 miles in diameter, with walls nearly 8000 feet above the\r\nfloor, which includes a bright central mountain. The inner slope of the\r\nborder on the E. is much terraced and contains some depressions. There is\r\na small isolated bright mountain 2000 feet high on the Mare Vaporum, some\r\ndistance to the E.\r\n\r\nBESSEL.--A bright circular crater, 14 miles in diameter, on the S. half\r\nof the Mare Serenitatis, and the largest object of its class thereon. Its\r\nfloor is depressed some 2000 feet below the surrounding surface, while\r\nthe walls, rising nearly 1600 feet above the plain, have peaks both on\r\nthe N. and S. about 200 feet higher. The shadows of these features, noted\r\nby Schroter in 1797, and by many subsequent observers, are very\r\nnoteworthy. I have seen the shadow of a third peak about midway between\r\nthe two. One may faintly imagine the magnificent prospect of the coast-\r\nline of the Mare with the Haemus range, which would be obtained were it\r\npossible to stand on the summit of one of these elevations. It is\r\ndoubtful whether Bessel has a central mountain. Neither Madler nor\r\nSchmidt have seen one, though Webb noted a peak on two occasions. I fail\r\nto see anything within the crater. The bright streak crossing the Mare\r\nfrom N. to S. passes through Bessel.\r\n\r\nLINNE.--A formation on the E. side of the Mare Serenitatis, described by\r\nLohrmann and Madler as a deep crater, but which in 1866 was found by\r\nSchmidt to have lost all the appearance of one. The announcement of this\r\napparent change led to a critical examination of the object by most of\r\nthe leading observers, and to a controversy which, if it had no other\r\nresult, tended to awaken an interest in selenography that has been\r\nmaintained ever since. According to Madler, the crater was more than 6\r\nmiles in diameter in his time, and very conspicuous under a low sun, a\r\ndescription to which it certainly did not answer in 1867 or at any\r\nsubsequent epoch. It is anything but an easy object to see well, as there\r\nis a want of definiteness about it under the best conditions, though the\r\nminute crater, the low ridges, and the nebulous whiteness described by\r\nSchmidt and noted by Webb and others, are traceable at the proper phase.\r\nAs in the case of Hyginus N, there are still many sceptics as regards\r\nactual change, despite the records of Lohrmann and Madler; but the\r\nevidence in favour of it seems to preponderate.\r\n\r\nCONON.--A bright little crater, 11 miles in diameter, situated among the\r\nintricacies of the Apennines, S. of Mount Bradley. It has a central hill,\r\nwhich is not a difficult object.\r\n\r\nARATUS.--One of the most brilliant objects on the visible surface of the\r\nmoon, a crater 7 miles in diameter, S. of Mount Hadley, surrounded by the\r\nlofty mountain arms and towering heights of the Apennines. A peak close\r\nby on the N. is more than 10,000 feet, and another farther removed\r\ntowards the N.W. is over 14,000 feet in altitude.\r\n\r\nAUTOLYCUS.--A ring-plain 23 miles in diameter, deviating considerably\r\nfrom circularity, W. of Archimedes, on the Mare Imbrium, or rather on\r\nthat part of it termed the Palus Putredinis. Its floor, which contains an\r\ninconspicuous central mountain, is depressed some 4000 feet below the\r\nsurrounding country. With a power of 150 on a 4 5/8 achromatic, Dr.\r\nSheldon of Macclesfield has seen two shallow crateriform depressions in\r\nthe interior, one nearly central, and the other about midway between it\r\nand the N. wall. The wall is terraced within, and has a crater just below\r\nits crest on the W., which, when the opposite border is on the morning\r\nterminator, is seen as a distinct notch. Autolycus is the centre of a\r\nminor ray-system.\r\n\r\nARISTILLUS.--A larger and much more elaborate ring-plain, 34 miles in\r\ndiameter, N. of Autolycus. Its complex wall, with its terraces within,\r\nand its buttresses, radiating spurs, and gullies without, forms a grand\r\ntelescopic object under a low sun on a good night. It rises on the east\r\n11,000 feet above the Mare, and is about 2000 feet lower on the W., while\r\nthe interior is depressed some 3000 feet. Its massive central mountain,\r\nsurmounted by many peaks, occupies a considerable area on the floor, and\r\nexhibits a digitated outline at the base. On the S. and W. a number of\r\ndeep valleys radiate from the foot of the border, some of them extending\r\nnearly as far as Autolycus. Shallower but more numerous and regular\r\nfeatures of the same class radiate towards the N.E. from the foot of the\r\nopposite wall. On the N.W. are several curved ridges, all trending\r\ntowards Theaetetus. On the S.E. the surface is trenched by a number of\r\ncrossed gullies, well seen when the E. wall is on the morning terminator.\r\nJust beyond the N. _glacis_ is a large irregular dusky enclosure with a\r\ncentral mound, and another smaller low ring adjoining it on the S.E. The\r\nvisibility of these objects is very ephemeral, as they disappear soon\r\nafter sunrise. Aristillus is also the centre of a bright ray system.\r\n\r\nTHEAETETUS.--A conspicuous ring-plain, about 16 miles in diameter, in the\r\nPalus Nebularum, N.W. of Aristillus. It is remarkable for its great\r\ndepth, the floor sinking nearly 5000 feet below the surface. Its walls,\r\n7000 feet high on the W., are devoid of detail. The _glacis_ on the S.W.\r\nhas a gentle slope, and extends for a great distance before it runs down\r\nto the level of the plain. Not far from the foot of the wall on the N. is\r\na row of seven or eight bright little hills, near the eastern side of\r\nwhich originates a distinct cleft that crosses the Palus in a N.W.\r\ndirection, and terminates among mountains between Cassini and Calippus. I\r\nhave seen this object easily with a 4 inch achromatic.\r\n\r\nCALIPPUS.--A bright ring-plain 17 miles in diameter, situated in the\r\nmidst of the intricate Caucasus Mountain range. On the E. is a brilliant\r\npeak rising more than 13,000 feet above the Palus Nebularum, and nearer\r\nthe border, on the N.E., is a second, more than 500 feet higher, with\r\nmany others nearly as lofty in the vicinity. Calippus has not apparently\r\na central peak or any other features on the floor.\r\n\r\nCASSINI.--This remarkable ring-plain, about 36 miles in diameter, is very\r\nsimilar in character to Posidonius. It has a very narrow wall, nowhere\r\nmore than 4000 feet in height, and falling on the E. to 1500 feet. Though\r\na prominent and beautiful object under a low sun, its attenuated border\r\nand the tone of the floor, which scarcely differs from that of the\r\nsurrounding surface, render it difficult to trace under a high angle of\r\nillumination, and perhaps accounts for the fact that it escaped the\r\nnotice of Hevel and Riccioli; though it is certainly strange that a\r\nformation which is thrown into such strong relief at sunrise and sunset\r\nshould have been overlooked, while others hardly more prominent at these\r\ntimes have been drawn and described. The outline of Cassini is clearly\r\npolygonal, being made up of several rectilineal sections. The interior,\r\nnearly at the same level as the outside country, includes a large bright\r\nring-plain, A, 9 miles in diameter and 2600 feet in depth, which has a\r\ngood-sized crater on the S. edge of a great bank which extends from the\r\nS.W. side of this ring-plain to the wall. On the E. side of the floor,\r\nclose to the inner foot of the border, is a bright deep crater about two-\r\nthirds of the diameter of A, and between it and the latter Brenner has\r\nseen three small hills. The outer slope of Cassini includes much detail.\r\nOn the S.W. is a row of shallow depressions just below the crest of the\r\nwall, and near the foot of the slope is a large circular shallow\r\ndepression associated with a valley which runs partly round it. The shape\r\nof the _glacis_ on the W. is especially noteworthy, the S.W. and N.W.\r\nsides meeting at a slightly acute angle at a point 10 or 12 miles W. of\r\nthe summit of the ring. On the outer E. slope is a curious elongated\r\ndepression, and on the N. slope two large dusky rings, well shown by\r\nSchmidt, but omitted in other maps. Most of these details are well within\r\nthe scope of moderate apertures. Perhaps the most striking view of\r\nCassini and its surroundings is obtained when the morning terminator is\r\non the central meridian.\r\n\r\nALEXANDER.--A large irregularly shaped plain, at least 60 miles in\r\nlongest diameter, enclosed by the Caucasus Mountains. On the S.W. and\r\nN.W. the border is lineal. It has a dark level floor on which there is a\r\ngreat number of low hills.\r\n\r\nEUDOXUS.--A bright deep ring-plain, about 40 miles in diameter, in the\r\nhilly region between the Mare Serenitatis and the Mare Frigoris, with a\r\nborder much broken by passes, and deviating considerably from\r\ncircularity. Its massive walls, rising more than 11,000 feet above the\r\nfloor on the W., and about 10,000 feet on the opposite side, are\r\nprominently terraced, and include crater-rows in the intervening valleys,\r\nwhile their outer slopes present a complicated system of spurs and\r\nbuttresses. There is a bright crater on the N. _glacis_, and some\r\ndistance beyond the wall on the N.W. is a small ring-plain, and on the\r\nS.E. another, with a conspicuous crater between it and the wall. Neison\r\ndraws attention to an area of about 1400 square miles on the N.E. which\r\nis covered with a great multitude of low hills. E. of Eudoxus are two\r\nshort crossed clefts, and on the N. a long cleft of considerable delicacy\r\nrunning from N.E. to S.W. It was in connection with this formation that\r\nTrouvelot, on February 20, 1877, when the terminator passed through\r\nAristillus and Alphonsus, saw a very narrow thread of light crossing the\r\nS. part of the interior and extending from border to border. He noted\r\nalso similar appearances elsewhere, and termed them _Murs enigmatiques_.\r\n\r\nARISTOTELES.--A magnificent ring-plain, 60 miles in diameter, with a\r\ncomplex border, surmounted by peaks, rising to nearly 11,000 feet above\r\nthe floor, one of which on the W., pertaining to a terrace, stands out as\r\na brilliant spot in the midst of shadow when the interior is filled with\r\nshadow. The formation presents its most striking aspect at sunrise, when\r\nthe shadow of the W. wall just covers the floor, and the brilliant inner\r\nslope of the E. wall with the little crater on its crest is fully\r\nilluminated. At this phase the details of the terraces are seen to the\r\nbest advantage. The arrangement of the parallel ridges and rows of hills\r\non the N.E. and S.W. is likewise better seen at this time than under an\r\nevening sun. A bright and deep ring-plain, about 10 miles in diameter,\r\nwith a distinct central mountain, is connected with the W. wall.\r\n\r\nEGEDE.--A lozenge-shaped formation, about 18 miles from corner to corner,\r\nbounded by walls scarcely more than 400 feet in height. It is\r\nconsequently only traceable under very oblique illumination.\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT ALPINE VALLEY.--A great wedge-shaped depression, cutting\r\nthrough the Alps W. of Plato, from W.N.W. to E.S.E. It is more than 80\r\nmiles in length, and varies in breadth from 6 miles on the S. to less\r\nthan 4 miles on the N., where it approaches the S. border of the Mare\r\nFrigoris. For a greater part of its extent it is bounded on the S.W. side\r\nby a precipitous linear cliff, which, under a low evening sun, is seen to\r\nbe fringed by a row of bright little hills. These are traceable up to one\r\nof the great mountain masses of the Alps, forming the S.W. side of the\r\ngreat oval-shaped expansion of the valley, whose shape has been\r\nappropriately compared to that of a Florence oil-flask, and which Webb\r\nterms \"a grand amphitheatre.\" On the opposite or N.E. side, the boundary\r\nof the valley is less regular, following a more or less undulating line\r\nup to a point opposite, and a little N. of, the great mountain mass,\r\nwhere it abuts on a shallow _quasi_ enclosure with lofty walls, which,\r\nprojecting westwards, considerably diminish the width of the valley.\r\nSouth of this lies another curved mountain ring, which still farther\r\nnarrows it. This curtailment in width represents the neck of the flask,\r\nand is apparently about 16 or 17 miles in length, and from 3 to 4 miles\r\nin breadth, forming a gorge, bordered on the W. by nearly vertical\r\ncliffs, towering thousands of feet above the bottom of the valley; and on\r\nthe E. by many peaked mountains of still greater altitude. At the\r\nentrance to the \"amphitheatre,\" the actual distance between the colossal\r\nrocks which flank the defile is certainly not much more than 2 miles.\r\nFrom this standpoint the view across the level interior of the elliptical\r\nplain would be of extraordinary magnificence. Towards the S., but more\r\nthan 12 miles distant, the outlook of an observer would be limited by\r\nsome of the loftiest peaks of the Alps, whose flanks form the boundary of\r\nthe enclosure, through which, however, by at least three narrow passes he\r\nmight perchance get a glimpse of the Mare Imbrium beyond. The broadest of\r\nthese aligns with the axis of the valley. It is hardly more than a mile\r\nwide at its commencement on the S. border of the \"amphitheatre,\" but\r\nexpands rapidly into a trumpet-shaped gorge, flanked on either side by\r\nthe towering heights of the Alps as it opens out on to the Mare. The\r\nbottom, both of the \"amphitheatre\" and of the long wedge-shaped valley,\r\nappears to be perfectly level, and, as regards the central portion of the\r\nlatter, without visible detail. Under morning illumination I have,\r\nhowever, frequently seen something resembling a ridge partially crossing\r\n\"the neck,\" and, near sunset, a tongue of rock jutting out from the E.\r\nflank of the constriction, and extending nearly from side to side. At the\r\nbase of the cliff bordering the valley on the S.W., five or six little\r\ncircular pits have been noted, some of which appear to have rims. They\r\nwere seen very perfectly with powers of 350 and 400 on an 8 1/2 inch\r\nCalver reflector at 8 h. on January 25, 1885, and have been observed, but\r\nless perfectly, on subsequent occasions. The most northerly is about 10\r\nmiles from the N.W. end of the formation, and the rest occur at nearly\r\nregular intervals between it and \"the neck.\" In the neighbourhood of the\r\nvalley, on either side, there are several bright craters. Three stand\r\nnear the N.E. edge, and one of considerable size near the N.W. end on the\r\nopposite side. A winding cleft crosses the valley about midway, which,\r\nstrange to say, is not shown in the maps, though it may be seen in a 4\r\ninch achromatic. It originates apparently at a bright triangular mountain\r\non the plain S.W. of the valley, and, after crossing the latter somewhat\r\nobliquely, is lost amid the mountains on the opposite side. That portion\r\nof it on the bottom of the valley is easily traceable under a high light\r\nas a white line. The region N. of the Alps on the S.W. side of the valley\r\npresents many details worthy of examination. Among them, parallel rows of\r\nlittle hills, all extending from N.W. to S.E. There is also a number of\r\nstill smaller objects of the same type on the E. side. The great Alpine\r\nvalley, though first described by Schroter, is said to have been\r\ndiscovered on September 22, 1727, by Bianchini, but it is very unlikely\r\nthat an object which is so prominent when near the terminator was not\r\noften remarked before this.\r\n\r\nARCHYTAS.--A bright ring-plain, 21 miles in diameter, on the edge of the\r\nMare Frigoris, due N. of the Alpine Valley, with regular walls rising\r\nabout 5000 feet above the interior on the N.W., and about 4000 feet on\r\nthe opposite side. It has a very bright central mountain. Several spurs\r\nradiate from the wall on the S., and a wide valley, flanked by lofty\r\nheights, forming the S.W. boundary of W.C. Bond, originates on the N\r\nside. There is also a crater-rill running towards the N.W. On the Mare,\r\nS.W. of Archytas, is a somewhat smaller ring-plain, Archytas A (called by\r\nSchmidt, PROTAGORAS), with lofty walls and a central hill.\r\n\r\nCHRISTIAN MAYER.--A prominent rhomboidal-shaped ring-plain, 18 miles in\r\ndiameter, associated on every side, except the N., with a number of\r\nirregular inconspicuous enclosures. It has a central peak. Madler\r\ndiscovered two delicate short clefts, both running from N.W. to S.E., one\r\non the W. and the other on the E. of this formation.\r\n\r\nW.C. BOND.--A great enclosed plain of rhomboidal shape on the N. of\r\nArchytas, the bright ring-plain Timaeus standing near its E. corner, and\r\nanother conspicuous but much smaller enclosure with a smaller crater W.\r\nof it on the floor at the opposite angle. The interior, which is covered\r\nwith rows of hillocks, is very noteworthy at sunrise.\r\n\r\nBARROW.--There are few more striking or beautiful objects at sunrise than\r\nthis, mainly because of the peculiar shape of its brilliant border and\r\nthe remarkable shadows of the lofty peaks on its western wall. There is a\r\nnotable narrow gap in the rampart on the W., which appears to extend to\r\nthe level of the floor. The walls, especially on the S., are very\r\nirregular, and include two large deep craters and some minor depressions.\r\nIf the formation is observed when its E. wall is on the morning\r\nterminator, a fine view is obtained of the remarkable crater-row which\r\nwinds round the N. side of Goldschmidt. Barrow is about 40 miles in\r\ndiameter. According to Schmidt, there is one crater in the interior, a\r\nlittle S.E. of the centre.\r\n\r\nSCORESBY.--A much fore-shortened deep ring-plain, 36 miles in diameter,\r\nbetween Barrow and the limb. It has a central mountain with two peaks,\r\nwhich are very difficult to detect.\r\n\r\nCHALLIS.--A ring-plain adjoining Scoresby on the N.E. It is of about the\r\nsame size and shape.\r\n\r\nMAIN.--A very similar formation, on the N. of the last, much too near the\r\nlimb to be well observed.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND QUADRANT\r\n\r\n\r\nEAST LONGITUDE 0 deg. TO 20 deg.\r\n\r\n\r\nMURCHISON.--A considerable ring-plain about 35 miles across on the E.,\r\nwhere it abuts on Pallas. It is a pear-shaped formation, bounded on the\r\nN. by a mountainous region, and gradually diminishes in width towards the\r\nS.E., on which side it is open to the plain. The walls are of no great\r\naltitude, but, except on the N.W., are very bright. At the S. termination\r\nof the W. wall there is an exceedingly brilliant crater, Murchison A,\r\nfive miles in diameter and some 3000 feet deep; adjoining which on the\r\nN.W. is an oval depression and a curious forked projection from the\r\nborder. The only objects visible in the interior are a few low ridges on\r\nthe E. side, and a number of long spurs running out from the wall on the\r\nN. towards the centre of the floor. Murchison A is named CHLADNI by\r\nLohrmann.\r\n\r\nPALLAS.--A fine ring-plain, about 32 miles in diameter, forming with\r\nMurchison an especially beautiful telescopic object under suitable\r\nillumination. Its brilliant border, broken by gaps on the W., where it\r\nabuts on Murchison, has a bright crater on the N.E., from which,\r\nfollowing the curvature of the wall, and just below its crest, runs a\r\nvalley in an easterly direction. There is a large bright central mountain\r\non the floor, with a smaller elevation to the S. of it, and a ridge\r\nextending from the N. wall to near the centre. On the W., a section of\r\nthe border is continued in a N. direction far beyond the limits of the\r\nformation; and on the S. it is connected with a small incomplete ring; on\r\nthe E. of which, near the foot of the wall, is a somewhat smaller and\r\nmuch duskier enclosure.\r\n\r\nBODE.--A brilliant ring-plain, 9 miles in diameter, situated on the N.\r\nside of Pallas. Its walls rise about 5000 feet above the interior, which\r\nis considerably depressed, and includes, according to Schmidt and Webb, a\r\nmountain or ridge. There are two parallel valleys on the W., which are\r\nwell worth examination.\r\n\r\nSOMMERING.--An incomplete ring-plain, 17 miles in diameter, situated on\r\nthe lunar equator. It has rather low broken walls and a dark interior.\r\n\r\nSCHROTER.--A somewhat larger formation, with a border wanting on the S.\r\nSchmidt draws a considerable crater on the S.W. side of the floor. It was\r\nin the region north of this object, which abounds in little hills and low\r\nridges, that in the year 1822 Gruithuisen discovered a very remarkable\r\nformation consisting of a number of parallel rows of hills branching out\r\n(like the veins of a leaf from the midrib) from a central valley at an\r\nangle of 45 deg., represented by a depression between two long ridges\r\nrunning from north to south. The regularly arranged hollows between the\r\nhills and the longitudinal valley suggested to his fertile imagination\r\nthat he had at last found a veritable city in the moon--possibly the\r\nmetropolis of Kepler's _Subvolvani_, who were supposed to dwell on that\r\nhemisphere of our satellite which faces the earth. At any rate, he was\r\nfirmly convinced that it was the work of intelligent beings, and not due\r\nto natural causes. This curious arrangement of ridges and furrows, which,\r\naccording to Webb, measures about 23 miles both in length and breadth,\r\nis, owing to the shallowness of the component hills and valleys, a very\r\ndifficult object to see in its entirety, as it must be viewed when close\r\nto the terminator, and even then the sun's azimuth and good definition do\r\nnot always combine to afford a satisfactory glimpse of its ramifications.\r\nM. Gaudibert has given a drawing of it in the _English Mechanic_, vol.\r\nxviii. p. 638.\r\n\r\nGAMBART.--A regular ring-plain, 16 miles in diameter, with a low border\r\nand without visible detail within; situated nearly on the lunar equator,\r\nabout 130 miles S.S.W. of Copernicus, at the N.W. edge of a very hilly\r\nregion. A prominent pear-shaped mountain, with a small crater upon it,\r\nstands a short distance on the S.W., and further in the same direction, a\r\nlarge bright crater with two much smaller craters on the N. of it. The\r\nrough hilly district about midway between Copernicus and Gambart is\r\nremarkable for its peculiar dusky tone and for certain small dark spots,\r\nfirst seen by Schmidt, and subsequently carefully observed by Dr. Klein.\r\nThe noteworthy region where these peculiar features are found represents\r\nan area of many thousand square miles, and must resemble a veritable\r\n_Malpais_, covered probably with an incalculable number of craters,\r\nvents, cones, and pits, filled with volcanic _debris_. It is among\r\ndetails of this character that the true analogues of some terrestrial\r\nvolcanoes must be looked for. Under a low angle of illumination the\r\nsurface presents an extraordinarily rough aspect, well worthy of\r\nexamination, but the dusky areas and the black spots can only be\r\nsatisfactorily distinguished under a somewhat high sun. I have, however,\r\nseen them fairly well when the W. wall of Reinhold was on the morning\r\nterminator.\r\n\r\nMARCO POLO.--A small and very irregularly-shaped enclosure (difficult to\r\nsee satisfactorily) on the S. flank of the Apennines. It is hemmed in on\r\nevery side by mountains.\r\n\r\nERATOSTHENES.--A noble ring-plain, 38 miles in diameter; a worthy\r\ntermination of the Apennines. The best view of it is obtained under\r\nmorning illumination when the interior is about half-filled with shadow.\r\nAt this phase the many irregular terraces on the inner slope of the E.\r\nwall (which rises at one peak 16,000 feet above an interior depressed\r\n8000 feet below the Mare Imbrium) are seen to the best advantage. The\r\ncentral mountain is made up of two principal peaks, nearly central, from\r\nwhich two bright curved hills extend nearly up to the N.W. wall,--the\r\nwhole forming a V-shaped arrangement. On the S. there is a narrow break\r\nin the wall, and the S.W. section of it seems to overlap and extend some\r\ndistance beyond the S.E. section. The border on the S.W. is remarkable\r\nfor the great width of its _glacis_. Eratosthenes exhibits a marked\r\ndeparture from circularity, especially on the E., where the wall consists\r\nof two well-marked linear sections, with an intermediate portion where\r\nthe crest for 20 miles or more bends inwards or towards the centre. From\r\nthe S.E. flank of this formation extends towards the W. side of Stadius\r\none of the grandest mountain arms on the moon's visible surface, rising\r\nat one place 9000 feet, and in two others 5000 and 3000 feet respectively\r\nabove the Mare Imbrium. If this magnificent object is observed when the\r\nmorning terminator falls a little E. of Stadius, it affords a spectacle\r\nnot easily forgotten. I have often seen it at this phase when its broad\r\nmass of shadow extended across the well-known crater-row W. of\r\nCopernicus, some of the component craters appearing between the spires of\r\nshade representing the loftiest peaks on the mountain arm. There is a\r\nprominent little crater on the crest of the arm between two of the peaks,\r\nand another on the plain to the west.\r\n\r\nSTADIUS.--An inconspicuous though a very interesting formation, 43 miles\r\nin diameter, W. of Copernicus, with a border scarcely exceeding 200 feet\r\nin height. Hence it is not surprising that it was for a long time\r\naltogether overlooked by Madler. Except as a known object, it is only\r\ntraceable under very oblique illumination, and even then some attention\r\nis required before its very attenuated wall can be followed all round. It\r\nis most prominent on the W., where it apparently consists of a S.\r\nextension of the Eratosthenes mountain-arm, and is associated with a\r\nnumber of little craters and pits. This is succeeded on the S.W. by a\r\nnarrow strip of bright wall, and on the S. by a section made up of a\r\npiece of straight wall and a strip curving inwards, forming the S. side.\r\nOn the E. the border assumes a very ghostly character, and appears to be\r\nmainly defined by rows of small depressions and mounds. On the N.E., N.,\r\nand N.W. it is still lower and narrower; so much so, that it is only for\r\nan hour or so after sunrise or before sunset that it can be traced at\r\nall. On every side, with the exception of the curved piece on the S., the\r\nwall consists of linear sections. The interior contains a great number of\r\nlittle craters and very low longitudinal mounds. Ten craters are shown in\r\nBeer and Madler's map. Schmidt only draws fifteen, though in the text\r\naccompanying his chart he says that he once counted fifty. In the\r\nmonograph published in the _Journal_ of the Liverpool Astronomical\r\nSociety (vol. v. part 8), forty-one are represented. They appear to be\r\nrather more numerous on the S. half of the floor than elsewhere. Just\r\nbeyond the limits of the border on the N., is a bright crater with a much\r\nlarger obscure depression on the W. of it. The former is surrounded by a\r\nmultitude of minute craters and crater-cones, which are easily seen under\r\na low sun. Though almost every trace of Stadius disappears under a high\r\nlight, I have had little difficulty in seeing portions of the border and\r\nsome of the included details when the morning terminator had advanced as\r\nfar as the E. wall of Herodotus, and the site was traversed by\r\ninnumerable light streaks radiating from Copernicus. At this phase the\r\nbright crater, just mentioned, on the N. edge of the border was tolerably\r\ndistinct.\r\n\r\nCOPERNICUS.--This is without question the grandest object, not only on\r\nthe second Quadrant, but on the whole visible superficies of the moon. It\r\nundoubtedly owes its supremacy partly to its comparative isolation on the\r\nsurface of a vast plain, where there are no neighbouring formations to\r\nvie with it in size and magnificence, but partly also to its favourable\r\nposition, which is such, that, though not central, is sufficiently\r\nremoved from the limb to allow all its manifold details to be critically\r\nexamined without much foreshortening. There are some other formations,\r\nLangrenus and Petavius, for example, which, if they were equally well\r\nsituated, would probably be fully as striking; but, as we see it\r\nCopernicus is _par excellence_ the monarch of the lunar ring-mountains.\r\nSchmidt remarks that this incomparable object combines nearly all the\r\ncharacteristics of the other ring-plains, and that careful study directed\r\nto its unequalled beauties and magnificent form is of much more value\r\nthan that devoted to a hundred other objects of the same class. It is\r\nfully 56 miles in diameter, and, though generally described as nearly\r\ncircular, exhibits very distinctly under high powers a polygonal outline,\r\napproximating very closely to an equilateral hexagon. There are, however,\r\ntwo sections of the crest of the border on the N.E. which are inflected\r\nslightly towards the centre, a peculiarity already noticed in the case of\r\nEratosthenes. The walls, tolerably uniform in height, are surmounted by a\r\ngreat number of peaks, one of which on the W., according to Neison,\r\nstands 11,000 feet above the floor, and a second on the opposite side is\r\nnearly as high. Both the inner and outer slopes of this gigantic rampart\r\nare very broad, each being fully 10 miles in width. The outer slope,\r\nespecially on the E., is a fine object at sunrise, when its rugged\r\nsurface, traversed by deep gullies, is seen to the best advantage. The\r\nterraces and other features on the bright inner declivities on this side\r\nmay be well observed when the sun's altitude is about 6 deg. Schmidt,\r\nwhose measures differ from those of Neison, estimates the height of the\r\nwall on the E. to be 12,000 feet, and states that the interior slopes\r\nvary from 60 deg. to 50 deg. above, to from 10 deg. to 2 deg. at the\r\nbase. The first inclination of 50 deg., and in some cases of 60 deg., is\r\nconfined to the loftiest steep crests and to the flanks of the terraces.\r\nThere are apparently five bright little mountains on the floor, the most\r\neasterly being rather the largest, and a great number of minute hillocks\r\non the S.E. quarter. S.W. of the centre is a little crater, and on the\r\nsame side of the interior a curious hook-shaped ridge, projecting from\r\nthe foot of the wall, and extending nearly halfway across the floor. The\r\nregion surrounding Copernicus is one of the most remarkable on the moon,\r\nbeing everywhere traversed by low ridges, enclosing irregular areas,\r\nwhich are covered with innumerable craterlets, hillocks, and other minute\r\nfeatures, and by a labyrinth of bright streaks, extending for hundreds of\r\nmiles on every side, and varying considerably both in width and\r\nbrilliancy.\r\n\r\nThe notable crater-row on the W., often utilised by observers for testing\r\nthe steadiness of the air and the definition of their telescopes, should\r\nbe examined when it is on the morning terminator, at which time Webb's\r\nhomely comparison, \"a mole-run with holes in it,\" will be appreciated,\r\nand its evident connection with the E. side of Stadius clearly made out.\r\nThere is another much more delicate row running closely parallel to this\r\nobject; it lies a little W. of it, and extends farther in a northerly\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nARCHIMEDES.--Next to Plato the finest object on the Mare Imbrium. It is\r\nabout 50 miles in diameter. The average height of its massive border is\r\nabout 4000 feet above the interior, which is only depressed some 500 or\r\n600 feet below the Mare, the highest peak (about 7000 feet) being on the\r\nS.E. The walls are terraced, and include much detail, both within and\r\nwithout. The most noteworthy features in connection with this formation\r\nare the crater-cones, craterlets, pits, white spots, and light streaks\r\nwhich figure on the otherwise smooth interior. Mr. T.P. Gray, F.R.A.S.,\r\nof Bedford, who, with praiseworthy assiduity, has devoted more than ten\r\nyears to the close scrutiny of these features, Mr. Stanley Williams, and\r\nothers, have detected four crater-cones on the E. half of the floor, and\r\nabout fifty minute craters and white spots, also probably volcanic vents,\r\nand a very curious and interesting series of light streaks, mostly\r\ntraversing the formation from E. to W. A little E. of the centre is a\r\ndusky oval area about 6 miles across, and S.W. of this is another, much\r\nsmaller. Under some conditions of illumination the two principal light\r\nmarkings may be traced over the W. wall, and for some distance on the\r\nplain beyond.\r\n\r\nOn the southern side of Archimedes is a very rugged mountain region,\r\nextending for more than 100 miles towards the south: on the W. of this\r\noriginates a remarkable rill-system, best seen under evening\r\nillumination. The two principal clefts follow a nearly parallel course up\r\nto the face of the Apennines near Mount Bradley, crossing in their way,\r\nalmost at right angles, other clefts which run at no great distance from\r\nthe E. foot of this range and ramify among the outlying hills. Archimedes\r\nA is a brilliant little ring-plain on the S.E. of Archimedes. It casts an\r\nextraordinary shadow at sunrise, and has a well-marked crater-row on the\r\nE. of it, and two long narrow valleys, one of which appears to be a\r\nsoutherly extension of the row.\r\n\r\nBEER.--A very bright little crater, with an unnamed formation of about\r\nthe same size adjoining it on the N., with which is associated a curious\r\nwinding ridge that appears to traverse a gap in its N. wall.\r\n\r\nTIMOCHARIS.--A fine ring-plain, 23 miles in diameter (the centre of a\r\nminor ray-system). It stands isolated on the Mare Imbrium (below the\r\nlevel of which it is depressed some 3000 feet), about midway between\r\nArchimedes and Lambert. Its walls, rising about 7000 feet above the\r\nfloor, are conspicuously terraced, and on their W. outer slopes exhibit\r\nsome remarkable depressions. There is a distinct break on the N., and a\r\nbright little crater on the N.W., connected with the foot of the _glacis_\r\nby a prominent ridge. On the bright central mountain, Schmidt, in 1842,\r\ndetected a crater, which is easily seen under a moderately high light.\r\nTimocharis and the neighbourhood, especially the peculiar shape of the\r\nterminator on the E. of the formation, is well worth examination at\r\nsunrise.\r\n\r\nPIAZZI SMYTH.--A conspicuous little ring-plain, 5 or 6 miles in diameter,\r\ndepressed about 1500 feet below the Mare Imbrium, with a border rising\r\nabout 2000 feet above it. With the curious arrangement of ridges, of\r\nwhich it is the apparent centre, it is a striking object under a low sun.\r\n\r\nKIRCH.--A rather smaller object of the same class on the S.E.\r\n\r\nPLATO.--This beautiful walled-plain, 60 miles in diameter, with its\r\nbright border and dark steel-grey floor, has, from the time of Hevelius\r\nto the present, been one of the most familiar objects to lunar observers.\r\nIn the rude maps of the seventeenth century it figures as the \"Lacus\r\nNiger Major,\" an appellation which not inaptly describes its appearance\r\nunder a high sun, when the sombre tone of its apparently smooth interior\r\nis in striking contrast to that of the isthmus on which the formation\r\nstands. It will repay observation under every phase, and though during\r\nthe last thirty years no portion of the moon has been more diligently\r\nscrutinised than the floor; the neighbourhood includes a very great\r\nnumber of objects of every kind, which, not having received so much\r\nattention, will afford ample employment to the possessor of a good\r\ntelescope during many lunations.\r\n\r\nThe border of Plato, varying in height from 3000 to 4000 feet above the\r\ninterior, is crowned by several lofty peaks, the highest (7400 feet)\r\nstanding on the N. side of the curious little triangular formation on the\r\nE. wall. Those on the W., three in number, reckoning from N. to S., are\r\nrespectively about 5000, 6000, and 7000 feet in altitude above the floor.\r\nThe circumvallation being very much broken and intersected by passes,\r\nexhibits many distinct breaches of continuity, especially on the S. There\r\nis a remarkable valley on the S.W., which, cutting through the border at\r\na wide angle, suddenly turns towards the S.E., and descends the slope of\r\nthe _glacis_ in a more attenuated form. Another but shorter valley is\r\ntraceable at sunrise on the W. On the N.W., the rampart is visibly\r\ndislocated, and the gap occupied by an intrusive mountain mass. This\r\ndislocation is not confined to the wall, but, under favourable\r\nconditions, may be traced across the floor to the broken S.E. border. It\r\nis probably a true \"fault.\" On the N.E., the inner slope of the wall is\r\nvery broad, and affords a fine example of a vast landslip.\r\n\r\nThe spots and faint light markings on the floor are of a particularly\r\ninteresting character. During the years 1869 to 1871 they were\r\nsystematically observed and discussed under the auspices of the Lunar\r\nCommittee of the British Association. Among the forty or more spots\r\nrecorded, six were found to be crater-cones. The remainder--or at least\r\nmost of them--are extremely delicate objects, which vary in visibility in\r\na way that is clearly independent of libration or solar altitude; and,\r\nwhat is also very suggestive, they are always found closely associated\r\nwith the light markings,--standing either upon the surface of these\r\nfeatures or close to their edges. Recent observations of these spots with\r\na 13 inch telescope by Professor W.H. Pickering, under the exceptionally\r\ngood conditions which prevail at Arequipa, Peru, have revived interest in\r\nthe subject, for they tend to show that visible changes have taken place\r\nin the aspect of the principal crater-cones and of some of the other\r\nspots since they were so carefully and zealously scrutinised nearly a\r\nquarter of a century ago. The gradual darkening of the floor of Plato as\r\nthe sun's altitude increases from 20 deg. till after full moon may be\r\nregarded as an established fact, though no feasible hypothesis has been\r\nadvanced to account for it.\r\n\r\nOn the N.E. of Plato is a large bright crater, A; and, extending in a\r\nline from this towards the E., is a number of smaller rings, the whole\r\ngroup being well worth examination. On the N. there is a winding cleft,\r\nand some short crossed clefts in the rugged surface just beyond the foot\r\nof the wall, which I have seen with a 4 inch achromatic. The region on\r\nthe W., imperfectly shown in the maps, includes much unrecorded detail.\r\nOn the Mare Imbrium S. of Plato is a large area enclosed by low ridges,\r\nto which Schroter gave the name \"Newton.\" It suggests the idea that it\r\nrepresents the ruin of a once imposing enclosure, of which the\r\nconspicuous mountain Pico formed a part.\r\n\r\nTIMAEUS.--A very bright ring-plain, 22 miles in diameter, with walls\r\nabout 4500 feet in height, on the coast-line of the Mare Frigoris, and\r\nassociated with the E. side of the great enclosed plain W.C. Bond.\r\nSchmidt shows a double hill, nearly central, and Neison a crater on the\r\nS.W. wall.\r\n\r\nBIRMINGHAM.--A large rhomboidal-shaped enclosure, defined by mountain\r\nchains and traversed by a number of very remarkable parallel ridges. It\r\nis situated nearly due N. of Plato on the N. edge of the Mare Frigoris,\r\nand lies on the S.E. side of W.C. Bond, to which it bears a certain\r\nresemblance. This region is characterised by the parallelism displayed by\r\nmany formations, large and small. It is more apparent hereabouts than in\r\nany other part of the moon's visible surface. When favourably placed\r\nunder a low morning sun, Birmingham is a striking telescopic object.\r\n\r\nFONTINELLE.--A fine ring-plain, 23 miles in diameter, on the N. margin of\r\nthe Mare Frigoris, N.N.E. of Plato, with a wall rising on the E., 6000\r\nfeet above a bright interior. I find its border indistinct and nebulous,\r\nexcepting under very oblique light, though three of the little craters\r\nupon it are bright and prominent. One stands on the S., another on the\r\nN.W., and a third on the E. Schmidt shows only the first of these, and\r\nNeison none of them. Fontinelle has a low central mountain which is\r\neasily distinguished. Fontinelle A, an isolated mountain on the S., is\r\nmore than 3000 feet high. On the N. there is a curious mountain group,\r\nalso of considerable altitude, and on the W. an irregular depression\r\nsurrounded by a dusky area. North of Fontinelle, extending towards\r\nGoldschmidt and the limb, Schroter discovered a very wide irregular\r\nvalley which he named \"J.J. Cassini.\" It is really nothing more than a\r\ngreat plain bounded by ridges. At 9 h. October 15, 1888, when Philolaus\r\nwas on the morning terminator, I had a fine view of it, and, as regards\r\nits general shape, found that it agreed very closely with Schroter's\r\ndrawing.\r\n\r\nEPIGENES.--A remarkable ring-plain, about 26 miles in diameter, abutting\r\non a mountain ridge running parallel to the E. flank of W.C. Bond. It is\r\na notable object under a low morning sun. There are several elevations on\r\nthe floor.\r\n\r\nGOLDSCHMIDT.--A great abnormally-shaped enclosure with lofty walls\r\nbetween Epigenes and the limb. Neison mentions only two crater-pits\r\nwithin. I have seen the rimmed crater shown by Schmidt on the W. side and\r\nthree or four other objects of a doubtful kind.\r\n\r\nANAXAGORAS.--A brilliant ring-plain of regular form, 32 miles in\r\ndiameter, adjoining Goldschmidt on the E. It is a prominent centre of\r\nlight streaks, some of which traverse the interior of Goldschmidt. On the\r\nnorth a peak rises to the height of 10,000 feet. There is a long ridge on\r\nthe floor, running from E. to W.\r\n\r\nGIOJA.--A ring-plain about 26 miles in diameter, near the north pole.\r\n\r\n\r\nEAST LONGITUDE 20 deg. TO 40 deg.\r\n\r\n\r\nREINHOLD.--A prominent ring-plain, 31 miles in diameter, with a lofty\r\nborder, rising at a peak on the W. to more than 9000 feet above the\r\nfloor. Its shape on the W. is clearly polygonal, the wall consisting of\r\nthree rectilineal sections, and on the E. it is made up of two straight\r\nsections connected by a curved section. The inner slope includes a\r\nremarkably distinct and regular terrace, the E. portion of which is well\r\nseen when the interior is about half illuminated by the rising sun. At\r\nthis phase also the great extent of the _glacis_ on the S.W., and the\r\ndeep wide gullies traversing it on the E. are observed to the best\r\nadvantage. The central mountain, though of considerable size, is not\r\nprominent. Close to Reinhold on the N.W. stands a noteworthy little\r\nformation with a low and partially lineal wall, exhibiting a gap on the\r\nnorth. There is a distinct crater on the S. side of its floor.\r\n\r\nGAY-LUSSAC.--A very interesting ring-plain, 15 miles in diameter,\r\nsituated in the midst of the Carpathian Highlands N. of Copernicus, with\r\na smaller but brighter and deeper formation (Gay-Lussac A) on the S.W. of\r\nit, and a conspicuous little crater, not more than 2 or 3 miles in\r\ndiameter, between the two. The interior of Gay-Lussac is traversed by two\r\ncoarse clefts, lying nearly in a meridional direction. The more easterly\r\nruns from the foot of the S. wall, near the little crater just mentioned,\r\nacross the floor to the low N. border, which it apparently cuts through,\r\nand extends for some distance beyond, terminating in a great oval\r\nexpansion. The other, which is not shown in the maps, is closely parallel\r\nto it, and can be traced up to the N. border, but not farther. Schmidt\r\nrepresents the first as a crater-row, which it probably is, as it varies\r\nconsiderably in width. From the S.E. side of the formation extends a long\r\ncleft, terminating at the end of a prominent spur from the S. side of the\r\nCarpathians. There are also two remarkable rill-like valleys, commencing\r\non the N. of Gay-Lussac A, which curve round the W. side of Gay-Lussac.\r\n\r\nHORTENSIUS.--This brilliant crater, about 10 miles in diameter, is\r\nremarkable for its depth, and as being a ray-centre surrounded by a\r\nnimbus of light. It has a central mountain, and Schmidt shows a minute\r\ncrater on the outer slope of the S. wall. The former is a test object.\r\n\r\nMILICHIUS.--Is situated on the N.N.E. of Hortensius. It is fully as\r\nbright, but rather smaller. Its floor, apparently devoid of detail, is\r\nconsiderably depressed below the surrounding surface.\r\n\r\nTOBIAS MAYER.--Like Gay-Lussac, a noteworthy ring-plain associated with\r\nthe Carpathian Mountains. It is 22 miles in diameter, and has a wall\r\nwhich rises on the W. to a height of nearly 10,000 feet above the floor;\r\non the latter there is a conspicuous central mountain, and on the E. side\r\na crater, and some little hills. Schmidt shows a smaller crater on the W.\r\nside, which I have not seen. Adjoining the formation on the W. is a ring-\r\nplain of about one-fourth its area, which is a bright object. Tobias\r\nMayer and the neighbouring Carpathians form an especially beautiful\r\ntelescopic picture at sunrise.\r\n\r\nKUNOWSKY.--An inconspicuous ring-plain, about 11 miles in diameter,\r\nstanding in a barren region in the Mare Procellarum, W.S.W. of Encke. The\r\ncentral mountain is tolerably distinct.\r\n\r\nENCKE.--A regular ring-plain, 20 miles in diameter, with a comparatively\r\nlow border, nowhere rising more than 1800 feet above the interior, which\r\nis depressed some 1000 feet below the surrounding Oceanus Procellarum. A\r\nlofty ridge traverses the floor from S. to N., bifurcating before it\r\nreaches the N. wall. There is a bright crater on the W. wall, and a\r\ndepression on the opposite wall, neither of which, strange to say, is\r\nshown on the maps. Encke is encircled by ridges, which, when it is on the\r\nmorning terminator, combine to make it resemble a large crater surrounded\r\nby a vast mountain ring.\r\n\r\nKEPLER.--One of the most brilliant objects in the second quadrant,--a\r\nring-plain about 22 miles in diameter, with a lofty border; a peak on the\r\nE. attaining an altitude of 10,000 feet above the surface. The wall is\r\nmuch terraced, especially the outer slope on the W., where a narrow\r\nvalley is easily traceable. Though omitted from the maps, there is a\r\nprominent circular depression on the W. border, which forms a distinct\r\nnotch thereon at sunrise. On the N., the wall exhibits a conspicuous\r\ngap. There is a central hill on the floor. Immediately E. of Kepler is a\r\nbright plateau, bounded on the N. by a very straight border, with two\r\nsmall craters on its edge. Both these objects are incomplete on the N.,\r\nas if they had been deformed by a \"fault,\" which has apparently affected\r\nthe N. end of Kepler also. Kepler is the centre of one of the most\r\nextended systems of bright streaks on the moon's visible surface.\r\n\r\nBESSARION.--A bright little ring-plain, about 6 miles in diameter, in the\r\nOceanus Procellarum N. of Kepler. There is a smaller and still brighter\r\ncompanion on the N. (Bessarion E), standing on a light area. Bessarion\r\nhas a minute central hill, difficult to detect.\r\n\r\nPYTHEAS.--A small rhomboidal-shaped ring-plain, 12 miles in diameter,\r\nstanding in an isolated position on the Mare Imbrium between Lambert and\r\nGay-Lussac. Its bright walls, rising about 2500 feet above the Mare, are\r\nmuch terraced within, especially on the E. There is a bright little\r\ncrater on the N. outer slope, with a short serpentine ridge running up to\r\nit from the region S. of Lambert, and another winding ridge extending\r\nfrom the S. wall to the E. of two conspicuous craters, standing about\r\nmidway between Pytheas and Gay-Lussac. The former bears a great\r\nresemblance to the ridge N. of Madler, and, like this, appears to\r\ntraverse the N. border. The interior of Pytheas, which is depressed more\r\nthan 2000 feet below the Mare, includes a brilliant central peak.\r\n\r\nLAMBERT.--A ring-plain, 17 miles in diameter, presenting many noteworthy\r\nfeatures. The crest of its border stands about 2000 feet above the Mare\r\nImbrium, and more than double this height above the interior. The wall is\r\nprominently terraced both within and without; the outer slope on the W.\r\nexhibiting at sunrise a nearly continuous valley running round it. When\r\nnear the morning terminator, the region on the N. is seen to be traversed\r\nby some very remarkable ridges and markings; one cutting across the N.\r\nwall appears to represent a \"fault.\" On the S. is a large polygonal\r\nenclosure formed by low ridges. On the W., towards Timocharis, is a\r\nbrilliant mountain 3000 feet high, a beautiful little object under a low\r\nsun.\r\n\r\nLEVERRIER.--The more westerly of a pair of little ring-plains on the N.\r\nside of the Mare Imbrium, and S.W. of the Laplace promontory. It is about\r\n10 miles in diameter, with walls rising some 1500 feet above the Mare,\r\nand more than 6000 feet above the interior, which seems to be without a\r\ncentral mountain or other features. Schmidt shows the crater on the N.\r\nrim and another on the S.E. slope, both of which are omitted by Neison,\r\nthough they are easy objects when Helicon is on the morning terminator.\r\nAbout 20 miles on the S.E. there is a very bright little crater on a\r\nfaint light area.\r\n\r\nHELICON.--The companion ring-plain on the E. It is 13 miles in diameter,\r\nand is very similar, though not quite so deep. There is a crater on the\r\nS.E. wall, and, according to Neison, another on the outer slope of the N.\r\nborder. Webb records a central crater. If Helicon is observed when on the\r\nmorning terminator, it will be seen to be traversed by a curved ridge\r\nwhich cuts through the walls, and runs up to a bright crater S.E. of\r\nLeverrier. It appears to be a \"fault,\" whose \"downthrow,\" though slight,\r\nis clearly indicated by an area of lower ground on the E. There is a\r\ngreat number of small craters in the neighbourhood of this formation.\r\n\r\nEULER.--The most easterly of the row of great ring-plains, which,\r\nbeginning on the W. with Autolycus, and followed by Archimedes,\r\nTimocharis, and Lambert, extends almost in a great circle from the N.W.\r\nto the S.E. side of the Mare Imbrium. It is about 19 miles in diameter,\r\nand is surrounded by terraced walls, which, though of no great height\r\nabove the Mare, rise 6000 feet above the floor. There is a distinct\r\nlittle gap in the S. wall, easily glimpsed when it is close to the\r\nmorning terminator, which probably represents a small crater. Euler has a\r\nbright central mountain, and is a centre of white silvery streaks.\r\n\r\nBRAYLEY.--A very conspicuous little ring-plain E.S.E. of Euler, with two\r\nsmaller but equally brilliant objects of the same class situated\r\nrespectively E. and W. of it.\r\n\r\nDIOPHANTUS.--Forms with Delisle, its companion on the N., a noteworthy\r\nobject. It is about 13 miles in diameter, with a wall, which has a\r\ndistinct break in its continuity on the N., rising about 2500 feet above\r\nthe Mare. A rill-valley runs from the E. side of the ring towards the W.\r\nface of a triangular-shaped mountain on the E. of a line joining the\r\nformation with Delisle. North are three bright little craters in a line,\r\nthe middle one being much the largest. From the most easterly of these\r\nobjects a light streak may be traced under a high sun, extending for many\r\nmiles to another small crater on the N.W. of Diophantus, and expanding at\r\na point due N. of the formation into a spindle-shaped marking. At\r\nsunrise, the W. portion of the streak has all the appearance of a cleft,\r\nwith a branch about midway running to the S. side of Delisle. Under the\r\nsame phase a broad band of shadow extends from the N.E. wall to the\r\ntriangular mountain just mentioned, representing a very sudden drop in\r\nthe surface--resembling on a small scale the well-known \"railroad\" E. of\r\nThebit. Diophantus has no central mountain.\r\n\r\nDELISLE.--A larger and more irregularly-shaped object than the last, 16\r\nmiles in diameter, with loftier and more massive walls, and an extensive\r\nbut ill-defined central hill. There is an evident break in the northern\r\nborder. A triangular mountain on the S.E. and a winding ridge running up\r\nto the N. wall are prominent features at sunrise, as are also the\r\nbrilliant summits of a group of hills some distance to the E.N.E.\r\n\r\nCARLINI.--A small but prominent and deep little crater about 5 miles in\r\ndiameter on the Mare Imbrium about midway between Lambert and the Sinus\r\nIridum. There are many faint light streaks in the vicinity, one of which\r\nextends from Carlini to Bianchini, on the edge of the Sinus,--a distance\r\nof 300 miles. Schmidt shows a central peak.\r\n\r\nCAROLINE HERSCHEL.--A bright and very deep ring-plain about 8 miles in\r\ndiameter on the Mare Imbrium, some distance E.N.E. of the last. On the\r\nS.E. lies a larger crater, Delisle B, which has a small but obvious\r\ncrater on its N. rim, and casts a very prominent shadow at sunrise.\r\nCaroline Herschel stands on a long curved ridge running N.E. from Lambert\r\ntowards the region E. of Helicon, and, according to Schmidt, has a\r\ncentral peak. On the E. is a bright mountain with two peaks; some\r\ndistance N. of which is a large ill-defined white spot, with another spot\r\nof a similar kind on the W. of it, nearly due N. of Caroline Herschel.\r\n\r\nGRUITHUISEN.--This ring-plain, 10 miles in diameter, is situated on the\r\nMare Imbrium on the N.E. of Delisle. It is associated with a number of\r\nridges trending towards the region N. of Aristarchus and Herodotus.\r\n\r\nTHE LAPLACE PROMONTORY.--A magnificent headland marking the extreme\r\nwestern extremity of the finest bay on the moon's visible surface, the\r\nSinus Iridum; above which it towers to a height of 9000 feet or more,\r\nprojecting considerably in front of the line of massive cliffs which\r\ndefine the border of the Sinus, and presenting a long straight face to\r\nthe S.E. Near its summit are two large but shallow depressions, the more\r\neasterly having a very bright interior. At a lower level, almost directly\r\nbelow the last, is a third depression. All three are easy objects under a\r\nlow sun. The best view of the promontory and its surroundings is obtained\r\nwhen the E. side of the bay is on the morning terminator. Its prominent\r\nshadow is traceable for many days after sunrise.\r\n\r\nTHE HERACLIDES PROMONTORY.--The less lofty but still very imposing\r\nheadland at the E. end of the Sinus Iridum, rising more than 4000 feet\r\nabove it. It consists of a number of distinct mountains, forming a\r\ntriangular-shaped group running out to a point at the S.W. extremity of\r\nthe bay, and projecting considerably beyond the shore-line. There is a\r\nconsiderable crater on the E. side of the headland, not visible till a\r\nlate stage of sunrise. It is among the mountains composing this\r\npromontory that some ingenuity and imagination have been expended in\r\nendeavouring to trace the lineaments of a female face, termed the \"Moon-\r\nmaiden.\"\r\n\r\nBIANCHINI.--A fine ring-plain, about 18 miles in diameter, on the N.E.\r\nside of the Sinus Iridum, surrounded by the lofty mountains defining the\r\nborder of the bay. Its walls, which are prominently terraced within, rise\r\nabout 7000 feet on the E., and about 8000 feet on the W. above the floor,\r\nwhich includes a prominent ridge and a conspicuous central mountain.\r\nThere is a distinct crater on the S. wall, not shown in the maps. Between\r\nthis side of the formation and the bay is a number of hills running\r\nparallel to the shore-line: these, with the intervening valleys, will\r\nrepay examination at sunrise.\r\n\r\nMAUPERTUIS.--A great mountain enclosure of irregular shape, about 20\r\nmiles in diameter, in the midst of the Sinus Iridum highlands, N. of\r\nLaplace. The walls are much broken by passes, and the interior includes\r\nmany hills and ridges.\r\n\r\nCONDAMINE.--A rhomboidal-shaped ring-plain, about 23 miles in diameter,\r\nN. of Maupertuis, with lofty walls, especially on the E., where they rise\r\nsome 4000 feet above the interior. There are three large depressions on\r\nthe outer N.W. slope, and at least three minute craters on the crest of\r\nthe wall just above. Though neither Neison nor Schmidt draw any detail\r\nthereon, there is a prominent ridge on the N. side of the floor, and a\r\nlow circular hill on the S. On the S.E. four long ridges or spurs radiate\r\nfrom the wall, and on the N.E. are three remarkable square-shaped\r\nenclosures. On the edge of the Mare Frigoris, N.W. of Condamine, are many\r\nlittle craters with bright rims and a distinct short cleft, running\r\nparallel to the coast-line. The winding valleys in the region bordering\r\nthe Sinus Iridum, and other curious details, render this portion of the\r\nmoon's surface almost unique.\r\n\r\nBOUGUER.--A bright regular little ring-plain, about 8 miles in diameter,\r\nN. of Bianchini.\r\n\r\nJ.F.W. HERSCHEL.--A vast enclosed plain, about 90 miles across, bounded\r\non the W. by a mountain range, which here defines the E. side of the Mare\r\nFrigoris, on the S. by massive mountains, and on the other sides by a\r\nlofty but much broken wall, intersected by many passes. Within is a large\r\nring-plain, nearly central, and a large number of little craters and\r\ncrater-pits. The floor is traversed longitudinally by many low ridges,\r\nlying very close together, which at sunrise resemble fine grooves or\r\nscratches of irregular width and depth.\r\n\r\nHORREBOW.--A ring-plain of remarkable shape, resembling the analemma\r\nfigure, standing at the S. end of the mountain range bounding J.F.W.\r\nHerschel on the W. Schmidt shows a crater on the W. wall, near the\r\nconstriction on this side, and a second at the foot of the slope of the\r\nE. wall.\r\n\r\nPHILOLAUS.--A ring-plain 46 miles in diameter, on the N.E. of Fontinelle.\r\nIts bright walls rise on the W. to a height of nearly 12,000 feet above\r\nthe floor (on which there is a conspicuous central mountain), and exhibit\r\nmany prominent terraces. Philolaus is partially encircled, at no great\r\ndistance, by a curved ridge, on which will be found a number of small\r\ncraters.\r\n\r\nANAXIMINES.--A much foreshortened ring-plain, about 66 miles in diameter,\r\non the E. of Philolaus. One peak on the E. is nearly 8000 feet in height.\r\nSchmidt shows four craters on the W. side of the floor, and a fifth on\r\nthe S.E. side. There is a bright streak in the interior, which extends\r\nsouthwards for some distance across the Mare Frigoris.\r\n\r\n\r\nEAST LONGITUDE 40 deg. TO 60  deg.\r\n\r\n\r\nREINER.--A regular ring-plain, 21 miles in diameter, in the Mare\r\nProcellarum, S.S.E. of Marius, with a very lofty border terraced without\r\nand within, and a minute but conspicuous mountain standing at the N. end\r\nof a ridge which traverses the uniformly dark floor in a meridional\r\ndirection. A long ridge extends some way towards the S. from the foot of\r\nthe S. wall, and at some distance in the same direction lie six ill-\r\ndefined white spots of doubtful nature. On the E.N.E. there is a large\r\nwhite marking, resembling a \"Jew's harp\" in shape, and farther on,\r\ntowards the E., a number of very remarkable ridges. On the W. will be\r\nfound many bright little craterlets. A ray from Kepler extends almost up\r\nto the W. wall of Reiner.\r\n\r\nMARIUS.--A very noteworthy ring-plain, 27 miles in diameter, in the\r\nOceanus Procellarum, E.N.E. of Kepler, with a bright border rising about\r\n4000 feet above the interior, which is of an uneven tone. The rampart\r\nexhibits some breaks, especially on the S. The outer slope on the W. is\r\ntraversed by a fine deep valley, distinctly marked when the opposite side\r\nis on the morning terminator. It originates on the S.W. at a prominent\r\ncrater situated a little below the crest of the wall, and, following its\r\ncurvature, runs out on to the plain near a large mountain just beyond the\r\nfoot of the N. border. In addition to the crater just mentioned, there\r\nare two smaller ones below the summit of the S. wall, and a small\r\ncircular depression on the S.E. wall. Mr. W.H. Maw, F.R.A.S., has seen,\r\nwith a 6 inch Cooke refractor, a bright marking at the N. extremity of\r\nthe ring, which, when examined with a Dawes' eyepiece, resembled an\r\nimperfect crater. The floor includes at least four objects--(1) A crater\r\non the N.W., standing on a circular light area; (2) a white spot a little\r\nS. of the centre; (3) a smaller white spot S.E. of this; (4) another,\r\nnear the inner foot of the S.W. wall. Marius is an imposing object under\r\noblique illumination, mainly because of the number of ridges by which it\r\nis surrounded. I have frequently remarked at sunrise that the surface on\r\nthe W., and especially the outer slope of the rampart, is of a decided\r\nbrown or sepia tint, similar to that which has already been noticed with\r\nrespect to Geminus and its vicinity, viewed under like conditions.\r\nSchmidt in 1862 discovered a long serpentine cleft some distance N. of\r\nMarius, which has not been seen since.\r\n\r\nARISTARCHUS.--The brightest object on the moon, forming with Herodotus (a\r\ncompanion ring-plain on the E.), and its remarkable surroundings, one of\r\nthe most striking objects which the telescope has revealed on the visible\r\nsurface, and one requiring much patient observation before its manifold\r\ndetails can be fully noted and duly appreciated. Its border rises 2000\r\nfeet above the outer surface on the W., but towers to more than double\r\nthis height above the glistening floor. No lunar object of its moderate\r\ndimensions (it is only about 29 miles in diameter) has such conspicuously\r\nterraced walls, or a greater number of spurs and buttresses; which are\r\nespecially prominent on the S. A valley runs round the outer slope of the\r\nW. wall, very similar to that found in a similar position round Marius.\r\nThere is also a distinct valley on the brilliant inner slope of the E.\r\nwall, below its crest. It originates at a bright little crater, and is\r\ntraceable round the greater portion of the declivity. Under a moderately\r\nhigh sun, an oval area, nearly as large and fully as brilliant as the\r\ncentral mountain, is seen on this inner slope. It is bordered on either\r\nside by bands of a duskier hue, which probably represent shallow\r\ntransverse valleys. From its dazzling brilliancy it is very difficult to\r\nobserve the interior satisfactorily. In addition, however, to the central\r\nmountain, there is a crater on the N.W. side of the floor. On the S. side\r\nof Aristarchus is a large dusky ring some 10 miles in diameter, connected\r\nby ridges with the spurs from the wall, and on the S.E., close to the\r\nfoot of the slope, is another smaller ring of a like kind.\r\n\r\nHERODOTUS.--This far less brilliant but equally interesting object is\r\nabout 23 miles in diameter, and is not so regular in shape as\r\nAristarchus. Its W. wall rises at one point more than 4000 feet above the\r\nvery dusky floor. Except on the S.W. and N.E., the border is devoid of\r\ndetail. On the S.W. three little notches may be detected on its summit,\r\nwhich probably represent small craters, while on the opposite side, on\r\nthe inner slope, a little below the crest, is a large crater, easily\r\nseen. Both the E. and W. sections of the wall are prolonged towards the\r\nS. far beyond the limits of the formation. These rocky masses, with an\r\nintermediate wall, are very conspicuous under oblique illumination, that\r\non the S.W. being especially brilliant. On the N. there is a gap through\r\nwhich the well-known serpentine cleft passes on to the floor. Between the\r\nN.W. side of Herodotus and Aristarchus is a large plateau, seen to the\r\nbest advantage when the morning terminator lies a little distance E. of\r\nthe former. It is traversed by a T-shaped cleft which communicates with\r\nthe great serpentine cleft and extends towards the S. end of Aristarchus,\r\ntill it meets a second cleft (forming the upper part of the T) running\r\nfrom the S.E. side of this formation along the W. side of Herodotus. The\r\ngreat serpentine cleft, discovered by Schroter, October 7, 1787, is in\r\nmany respects the most interesting object of its class. It commences at\r\nthe N. end of a short wide valley, traversing mountains some distance\r\nN.E. of Herodotus, as a comparatively delicate cleft. After following a\r\nsomewhat irregular course towards the N.W. for about 50 miles, and\r\nbecoming gradually wider and deeper, it makes a sudden turn and runs for\r\nabout 10 miles in a S.W. direction. It then changes its course as\r\nabruptly to the N.W. again for 3 or 4 miles, once more turns to the S.W.,\r\nand, as a much coarser chasm, maintains this direction for about 20\r\nmiles, till it reaches the S.E. edge of a great mountain plateau N. of\r\nAristarchus, when it swerves slightly towards the S., becoming wider and\r\nwider, up to a place a few miles N. of Herodotus, where it expands into a\r\nbroad valley; and then, somewhat suddenly contracting in width, and\r\nbecoming less coarse, enters the ring-plain through a gap in the N. wall,\r\nas before mentioned. I always find that portion of the valley in the\r\nneighbourhood of Herodotus more or less indistinct, though it is broad\r\nand deep. This part of it, unless it is observed at a late stage of\r\nsunrise, is obscured by the shadow of the mountains on the border of the\r\nplateau. Gruithuisen suspected a cleft crossing the region embraced by\r\nthe serpentine valley, forming a connection between its coarse southern\r\nextremity and the long straight section. This has been often searched\r\nfor, but never found. It may exist, nevertheless, for in many instances\r\nGruithuisen's discoveries, though for a long time discredited, have been\r\nconfirmed. The mountain plateau N. of Aristarchus deserves careful\r\nscrutiny, as it abounds in detail and includes many short clefts.\r\n\r\nHARBINGER, MOUNTAINS.--A remarkable group of moderate height, mostly\r\nextending from the N.W. towards Aristarchus. They include a large\r\nincomplete walled-plain about 30 miles in diameter, defined on the W. by\r\na lofty border, forming part of a mountain chain, and open to the south.\r\nThis curious formation has many depressions in connection with its N.W.\r\nedge. On the N. of it there is a crater-row and a very peculiar zig-zag\r\ncleft. The region should be observed when the E. longitude of the morning\r\nterminator is about 45 deg.\r\n\r\nSCHIAPARELLI.--A conspicuous formation, about 16 miles in diameter,\r\nbetween Herodotus and the N.E. limb, with a border rising nearly 2000\r\nfeet above the Mare, and about 1000 more above the floor, on which\r\nSchmidt shows a central hill.\r\n\r\nWOLLASTON.--A small bright crater on the Mare N. of the Harbinger\r\nMountains, surpassed in interest by a remarkable formation a few miles S.\r\nof it, Wollaston B, an object of about the same size, but which is\r\nassociated with a much larger enclosure, resembling a walled-plain, lying\r\non the N. side of it. This formation has a lofty border on the W.,\r\nsurmounted by two small craters. The wall is lower on the E. and exhibits\r\na gap. There is a central hill, only visible under a low sun. About\r\nmidway between Wollaston and this enclosure stands a small isolated\r\ntriangular mountain. From a hill on the E. runs a rill valley to the more\r\nwesterly of a pair of craters, connected by a ridge, on the S.E. of\r\nWollaston B.\r\n\r\nMAIRAN.--A bright ring-plain of irregular shape, 25 miles in diameter, on\r\nthe E. of the Heraclides promontory. The border, especially on the E.,\r\nvaries considerably in altitude, as is evident from its shadow at\r\nsunrise; at one peak on the W. it is said to attain a height of more than\r\n15,000 feet above the interior. There is a very minute crater on the\r\ncrest of the S. wall, down the inner slope of which runs a rill-like\r\nvalley. About halfway down the inner face of the E. wall are two other\r\nsmall craters, connected together by a winding valley. These features may\r\nbe seen under morning illumination, when about one-fourth of the floor is\r\nin sunlight. Schroter is the only selenographer who gives Mairan a\r\ncentral mountain. In this he is right. I have seen without difficulty on\r\nseveral occasions a low hill near the centre. The formation is surrounded\r\nby a number of conspicuous craters and crater-pits. On the N. there is a\r\nshort rill-like valley, and another, much coarser, on the S.\r\n\r\nSHARP.--A ring-plain somewhat smaller than the last, on the E. of the\r\nSinus Iridum, from the coast-line of which it is separated by lofty\r\nmountains. There is a distinct crater at the foot of its N.E. wall, and a\r\nbright central mountain on the floor. On the N. is a prominent enclosure,\r\nnearly as large as Sharp itself; and on the N.E. a brilliant little ring-\r\nplain, A, about 8 miles in diameter, connected with Sharp, as Madler\r\nshows, by a wide valley.\r\n\r\nLOUVILLE.--A triangular-shaped formation on the E. of a line joining\r\nMairan and Sharp. It is hemmed in by mountains, one of which towers 5000\r\nfeet above its dusky floor.\r\n\r\nFOUCAULT.--A bright deep ring-plain, about 10 miles in diameter, lying E.\r\nof the mountains fringing the Sinus Iridum, between Bianchini and\r\nHarpalus. A very lofty peak rises near its N. border, and, according to\r\nNeison, it has a distinct central mountain, though neither Madler or\r\nSchmidt show any detail within.\r\n\r\nHARPALUS.--A conspicuous ring-plain, about 14 miles in diameter, on the\r\nN.E. of the last, with a floor sinking 13,000 feet below the surrounding\r\nsurface. As the cubic contents of the border and _glacis_ are quite\r\ninadequate to account for it, we may ask, what has become of the material\r\nwhich presumably once filled this vast depression? Harpalus has a bright\r\ncentral mountain.\r\n\r\nSOUTH.--On the W. and S., the boundaries of this extensive enclosure are\r\nmerely indicated by ridges, which nowhere attain the dignity of a wall.\r\nOn the N., the edge of a tableland intersected by a number of valleys\r\ndefine its limits, and on the E. a border forming also the W. side of\r\nBabbage. The interior is traversed by a number of longitudinal hills, and\r\nincludes two bright little heights, drawn by Schmidt as craters.\r\n\r\nBABBAGE.--A still larger enclosed area, adjoining South on the E., and\r\ncontaining a considerable ring-plain near its W. border. It is a fine\r\ntelescopic object at sunrise, the interior being crossed by a number of\r\ntransverse markings representing ridges. These are very similar in\r\ncharacter (but much coarser) to those found on the floor of J.F.W.\r\nHerschel. The curious detail on the E. wall is also worth examination at\r\nthis phase.\r\n\r\nROBINSON.--A bright and very deep little ring-plain, about 12 miles in\r\ndiameter, on a plateau N. of South. Schmidt shows a crater on the W.\r\nborder, and two others at the foot of the N. and E. borders respectively.\r\n\r\nANAXIMANDER.--A fine but much foreshortened ring-plain, 39 miles in\r\ndiameter, abutting on the E. side of J.F.W. Herschel. It has a large\r\ncrater on its W. border, which is common to the two formations, and a\r\nvery prominent crater, both on the S. and N. The barrier on the S.W.\r\nrises to a height of nearly 10,000 feet. Schmidt shows a crater and other\r\ndetails on the floor.\r\n\r\n\r\nEAST LONGITUDE 60 deg. TO 90  deg.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOHRMANN.--This ring-plain, with Hevel and Cavalerius on the N. of it, is\r\na member of a linear group, which, but for its propinquity to the limb,\r\nwould be one of the most imposing on the moon's surface. Lohrmann, about\r\n28 miles in diameter, is surrounded by a bright wall, which, to all\r\nappearance, is devoid of detail. Two prominent ridges, with a fine\r\nintervening valley, connect it with the N. end of Grimaldi. It has a\r\nlarge but not conspicuous central mountain. On the rugged surface,\r\nbetween the ring-plain and the E. edge of the Oceanus Procellarum, lies a\r\nvery interesting group of crossed clefts, some of which run from N.E. to\r\nS.W., and others from N.W. to S.E. Three of the latter proceed from\r\ndifferent points in a coarse valley extending from W. to E., and cross\r\nthe ridges just mentioned. They follow a parallel course, and terminate\r\non the S. side of a crater-row, consisting of three bright craters\r\nranging in a line parallel to the coarse valley. On the N. side of these\r\nobjects, and tangential to them, is another cleft, which traverses the W.\r\nand E. walls of Lohrmann, and, crossing the region between it and\r\nRiccioli, terminates apparently at the W. wall of the latter formation.\r\nNo map shows this cleft, though it is obvious enough; and, when the E.\r\nwall of Hevel is on the morning terminator, the notches made by it in the\r\nborder of Lohrmann are easily detected. Capt. Noble, F.R.A.S., aptly\r\ncompares two of the crossed clefts to a pair of scissors, the craters at\r\nwhich they terminate representing the oval handles. On the grey surface\r\nof the Mare W. of Lohrmann is the bright crater Lohrmann A, from which,\r\nrunning N., proceeds a rill-like valley ending at a large white spot,\r\nwhich has a glistening lustre under a high light.\r\n\r\nHEVEL.--A great walled-plain, 71 miles in diameter, adjoining Lohrmann on\r\nthe N., with a broad western rampart, rising at one peak to a height\r\nabove the interior of nearly 6000 feet, and presenting a steep bright\r\nface to the Oceanus Procellarum. There are three prominent craters near\r\nits crest, and one or two breaks in its continuity. It is not so lofty\r\nand is more broken on the E., where three conspicuous craters stand on\r\nits inner slope. The floor is slightly convex, and includes a triangular\r\ncentral mountain, on which there is a small crater. The S. half of the\r\ninterior is crossed by four clefts: (l) running from a little crater N.\r\nof the central mountain, on the W. side of it, to a hill at the foot of\r\nthe S.W. wall; (2) originating near the most southerly of the three\r\ncraters on the inner slope of the E. wall, and crossing 1, terminates at\r\nthe foot of the W. wall; (3) has the same origin as 2, crosses 1, and,\r\npassing over a craterlet W. of the central mountain, also runs up to the\r\nW. wall at a point considerably N. of that where 2 joins the latter; (4)\r\nruns from the craterlet just mentioned to the W. end of 2.\r\n\r\nCAVALERIUS.--The most northerly member of the linear chain, a ring-plain,\r\n41 miles in diameter, with terraced walls rising about 10,000 feet above\r\nthe floor. Within there is a long central mountain with three peaks.\r\nUnder a high light the region on the W. is seen to be crossed by broad\r\nlight streaks.\r\n\r\nOLBERS.--A large ring-plain, 41 miles in diameter, near the limb, N.E. of\r\nCavalerius. Though a very distinct formation, it is difficult to see its\r\ndetails except under favourable conditions of libration. It has a large\r\ncrater on its W. wall, a smaller one on the E., and a third on the N. The\r\nfloor includes a central mountain, and, according to Schmidt, four\r\ncraters. He also shows a crater-rill on the W. wall, N. of the large\r\ncrater thereon. Olbers is the origin of a fine system of light rays.\r\n\r\nGALILEO.--A ring-plain, about 9 miles in diameter, N.E. of Reiner,\r\nassociated with ridges, some of which extend to the \"Jew's Harp\" marking\r\nreferred to under this formation.\r\n\r\nCARDANUS.--A fine regular ring-plain, about 32 miles in diameter, near\r\nthe limb N. of Olbers. Its bright walls, rising about 4000 feet above the\r\nlight grey floor, are clearly terraced, and exhibit, especially on the\r\nS.E., several spurs and buttresses. There is a fine valley on the outer\r\nW. slope, a large bright crater on the Mare just beyond its foot, and a\r\nconspicuous mountain in the same position farther north. I have not\r\nsucceeded in seeing the faint central hill nor the crater N. of it shown\r\nby Schmidt, but there is a brilliant white circular spot on the floor at\r\nthe inner foot of the N.E. wall which he does not show.\r\n\r\nKRAFFT.--A very similar object on the N., of about the same dimensions;\r\nwith a central peak, and a large crater on the dark floor abutting on the\r\nS.W. wall, and another of about half the size on the outer side of the W.\r\nborder. From this crater a very remarkable cleft runs to the N. wall of\r\nCardanus: it is bordered on either side by a bright bank, and cuts\r\nthrough the N.W. border of the latter formation. It is best seen when the\r\nE. wall of Cardanus is on the morning terminator.\r\n\r\nVASCO DE GAMA.--A bright enclosure, 51 miles in diameter, with a small\r\ncentral mountain. It is associated on the N. with a number of enclosed\r\nareas of a similar class, all too near the limb to be well seen.\r\n\r\nSELEUCUS.--A considerable ring-plain, 32 miles in diameter, with lofty\r\nterraced walls, rising 10,000 feet above a dark floor which includes an\r\ninconspicuous central hill. This formation stands on a ridge extending\r\nfrom near Briggs to the W. side of Cardanus.\r\n\r\nOTTO STRUVE.--An enormous enclosure, bounded on the E. by the Hercynian\r\nMountains, and on the W. by a mountain chain of considerable altitude,\r\nsurmounted by three or more bright little rings. On the W. side of the\r\nuneven-toned interior, which, according to Madler, includes an area of\r\nmore than 26,000 square miles, stand four craters, several little hills,\r\nand light spots. On the W. is the much more regular and almost as large\r\nformation, Otto Struve A, the W. border of Otto Struve forming its E.\r\nwall. This enclosure is bounded elsewhere by a very low, broken, and\r\nattenuated barrier. At sunrise the E. and W. walls, with the mountain\r\nmass at the N. end, which they join, resemble a pair of partially-opened\r\ncalipers. There is one conspicuous little crater on the W. side of the\r\nfloor; and, at or near full moon, four or five white spots, nearly\r\ncentral, are prominently visible.\r\n\r\nBRIGGS.--This bright regular ring-plain, 33 miles in diameter, is\r\nsituated a short distance N. of Otto Struve A. A long ridge traverses the\r\ninterior from N. to S. On the E. is another large enclosure,\r\ncommunicating with Otto Struve on the S., and really forming a N.\r\nextension of this formation. It has a large and very deep crater, 12\r\nmiles in diameter, on its W. border.\r\n\r\nLICHTENBERG.--A conspicuous little ring-plain, about 12 miles in\r\ndiameter, in an isolated position on the Mare, some distance N. of\r\nBriggs. It was here that Madler records having occasionally noticed a\r\npale reddish tint, which, though often searched for, has not been\r\nsubsequently seen.\r\n\r\nULUGH BEIGH.--A good-sized ring-plain, E. of the last, with a bright\r\nborder and central mountain. Too near the limb for observation.\r\n\r\nLAVOISIER.--A small bright walled-plain N. of Ulugh Beigh. It has a\r\nsomewhat dark interior. West of it is Lavoisier A, a ring-plain about 14\r\nmiles in diameter. Both are too near the limb for useful observation.\r\n\r\nGERARD.--A large enclosure close to the limb, still farther N.,\r\ncontaining a long ridge and a crater.\r\n\r\nHARDING.--A small ring-plain W. of Gerard, remarkable for the peculiar\r\nform of its shadow at sunrise, and for the ridges in its vicinity.\r\n\r\nREPSOLD.--The largest of a group of walled enclosures, close to the limb,\r\non the E. side of the Sinus Roris.\r\n\r\nXENOPHANES.--But for its position, this deep walled-plain, 185 miles in\r\ndiameter, would be a fine telescopic object, with its lofty walls, large\r\ncentral mountain, and other details.\r\n\r\nOENOPIDES.--A large and tolerably regular walled-plain, 43 miles in\r\ndiameter, on the W. of the last. The depressions on the W. wall are worth\r\nexamination at sunrise. There is apparently no detail whatever on the\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\nCLEOSTRATUS.--A small ring-plain, N. of Xenophanes, surrounded by a\r\nnumber of similar objects, all too near the limb for observation.\r\n\r\nPYTHAGORAS.--A noble walled-plain, 95 miles in diameter, which no one who\r\nobserves it fails to lament is not nearer the centre of the disc, as it\r\nwould then undoubtedly rank among the most imposing objects of its class.\r\nEven under all the disadvantages of position, it is by far the most\r\nstriking formation in the neighbourhood. Its rampart rises, at one point\r\non the N., to a height of nearly 17,000 feet above the floor, on which\r\nstands a magnificent central mountain, familiar to most observers.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIRD QUADRANT\r\n\r\n\r\nEAST LONGITUDE 0 deg. TO 20 deg.\r\n\r\n\r\nMOSTING.--A very deep ring-plain, 15 miles in diameter, near the moon's\r\nequator, and about 6 deg. E. of the first meridian. There is a crater on\r\nthe N. side of its otherwise unbroken bright border, an inconspicuous\r\ncentral mountain, and, according to Neison, a dark spot on the S. side of\r\nthe floor. At some distance on the S.S.W., stands the bright crater,\r\nMosting A, one of the most brilliant objects on the moon's visible\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nREAUMUR.--A large pentagonal enclosure, about 30 miles in diameter, with\r\na greatly broken border, exhibiting many wide gaps, situated on the E.\r\nside of the Sinus Medii, N.W. of Herschel. The walls are loftiest on the\r\nS. and S.W., where several small craters are associated with them. A\r\nridge connects the formation with the great deep crater Reaumur A, and a\r\nsecond large enclosure lying on the W. side of the well-known valley W.\r\nof Herschel. At the end of a spur on the S. side of the great crater\r\noriginates a cleft, which I have often traced to the N.W. wall of\r\nPtolemaeus, and across the N. side of the floor of this formation to a\r\ncrater on the N.E. quarter of it, Ptolemaeus _d_. There is a short cleft\r\non the W. side of the floor of Reaumur, running from N. to S.\r\n\r\nHERSCHEL.--A typical ring-plain, situated just outside the N. border of\r\nPtolemaeus, with a lofty wall rising nearly 10,000 feet above a somewhat\r\ndusky floor, which includes a prominent central mountain. Its bright\r\nborder is clearly terraced both within and without, the terraces on the\r\ninner slope of the W. wall being beautifully distinct even under a high\r\nlight, and on the outer slope are some curious irregular depressions. On\r\nthe S.S.E. is a large oblong deep crater, close to the rocky margin of\r\nPtolemaeus, and a little beyond the foot of the wall on the N.W. is a\r\nsmaller and more regular rimmed depression, _b_, standing near the E.\r\nborder of the great valley, more than 80 miles long, and in places fully\r\n10 miles wide, which runs from S.S.W. to N.N.E. on the W. side of\r\nHerschel, and bears a close resemblance to the well-known Ukert Valley.\r\nHerschel _d_ is a large but shallow ring-plain on the E. of Herschel,\r\nwith a brilliant but smaller crater on the W. of it.\r\n\r\nNorth of Herschel, on a plateau concentric with its outline, stands the\r\nlarge polygonal ring-plain Herschel _a_, a formation of a very\r\ninteresting character, with a low broken wall, exhibiting many gaps, and\r\nincluding some craters of a minute class. The largest of these stands on\r\nthe S.W. wall. Mr. W.H. Maw has detected some of these objects on the N.\r\nside, both in connection with the border and beyond it.\r\n\r\nFLAMMARION.--A large incomplete walled-plain N.E. of Herschel, open\r\ntowards the N., with a border rising about 3000 feet above the floor. The\r\nbrilliant crater, Mosting A, stands just outside the wall on the E.\r\n\r\nPTOLEMAEUS.--Taking its very favourable position into account, this is\r\nundoubtedly the most perfect example of a walled-plain on the moon's\r\nvisible superficies. It is the largest and most northerly component of\r\nthe fine linear chain of great enclosures, which extend southwards, in a\r\nnearly unbroken line, to Walter. It exhibits a very marked departure from\r\ncircularity, the outline of the border approximating in form to a hexagon\r\nwith nearly straight sides. It includes an area of about 9000 square\r\nmiles, the greatest distance from side to side being about 115 miles. It\r\nis, in fact, about equal in size to the counties of York, Lancashire, and\r\nWestmorland combined; and were it possible for one to stand near the\r\ncentre of its vast floor, he might easily suppose that he was stationed\r\non a boundless plain; for, except towards the west, not a peak, or other\r\nindication of the existence of the massive rampart would be discernible;\r\nand even in this direction he would only see the upper portion of a great\r\nmountain on the wall.\r\n\r\nThe border is much broken by gaps and intersected by passes, especially\r\nE. and S., where there are several valleys connecting the interior with\r\nthat of Alphonsus. The loftiest portion of the wall, which includes many\r\ncrateriform depressions, is on the W., where one peak rises to nearly\r\n9000 feet. Another on the N.E. is about 6000 feet above the interior. On\r\nthe N.W. is a remarkable crater-row, called, from its discoverer, \"Webb's\r\nfurrow,\" running from a point a little N. of a depression on the border\r\nto a larger crateriform depression on the S. of Hipparchus K. Birt terms\r\nit \"a very fugitive and delicate lunar feature.\" As regards the vast\r\nsuperficies enclosed by this irregular border, it is chiefly remarkable\r\nfor the number of large saucer-shaped hollows which are revealed on its\r\nsurface under a low sun. They are mostly found on the eastern quarter of\r\nthe floor. Some of them appear to have very slight rims, and in two or\r\nthree instances small craters may be detected within them. Owing to their\r\nshallowness, they are very evanescent, and can only be glimpsed for an\r\nhour or so about sunrise or sunset. The large bright crater A, about 4\r\nmiles in diameter on the N.W. side of the interior, is by far the most\r\nconspicuous object upon it. Adjoining it on the N. is a large ring with a\r\nlow border, and N. of this again is another, extending to the wall. Mr.\r\nMaw and Mr. Mee have seen minute craters on the borders of these obscure\r\nformations. In addition to the objects just specified, there is a fairly\r\nconspicuous crater, _d_, on the N.E. quarter of the floor, and a very\r\nlarge number of others distributed on its surface, which is also\r\ntraversed by a network of light streaks, that have recently been\r\ncarefully recorded by Mr. A.S. Williams. A cleft, from near Reaumur A,\r\ntraverses the N. side of the floor, and runs up to Ptolemaeus _d_.\r\n\r\nALPHONSUS.--A large walled-plain, 83 miles in diameter, with a massive\r\nirregular border abutting on the S.S.E. side of Ptolemaeus, and rising at\r\none place on the N.W. to a height of 7000 feet above the interior. The\r\nfloor presents many features of interest. It includes a bright central\r\npeak, forming part of a longitudinal ridge, on either side of which runs\r\na winding cleft, originating at a crater-row on the N. side of the\r\ninterior. There is a third cleft on the N.W. side, and a fourth near the\r\nfoot of the E. wall. There are also three peculiar dark areas within the\r\ncircumvallation; two, some distance apart, abutting on the W. wall, and a\r\nthird, triangular in shape, at the foot of the E. wall. The last-\r\nmentioned cleft traverses this patch. These dusky spots are easily\r\nrecognised in good photographs of the moon.\r\n\r\nALPETRAGIUS.--A fine object, 27 miles in diameter, closely connected with\r\nthe S.E. side of Alphonsus. It has peaks on the W. towering 12,000 feet\r\nabove the floor, on which there is an immense central mountain, which in\r\nextent, complexity, and altitude surpasses many terrestrial mountain\r\nsystems--as, for example, the Snowdonian group. The massive barrier\r\nbetween Alpetragius and Alphonsus deserves careful scrutiny, and should\r\nbe examined under a moderately low morning sun. On the E., towards\r\nLassell, stands a brilliant light-surrounded crater.\r\n\r\nARZACHEL.--Another magnificent object, associated on the N. with\r\nAlphonsus, about 66 miles in diameter, and encircled by a massive complex\r\nrampart, rising at one point more than 13,000 feet above a depressed\r\nfloor. It presents some very suggestive examples of terraces and large\r\ndepressions, the latter especially well seen on the S.E. The bright\r\ninterior includes a large central mountain with a digitated base on the\r\nS.E., some smaller hills on the S. of it, a deep crater W. of it (with\r\nsmall craters N. and S.), and, between the crater and the foot of the W.\r\nwall, a very curious winding cleft.\r\n\r\nLASSELL.--This ring-plain, some 14 miles in diameter, is irregular both\r\nas regards its outline and the width of its rampart. There is a crater on\r\nthe crest of the N.W. wall, just above a notable break in its continuity\r\nthrough which a ridge from the N.W. passes. There is another crater on\r\nthe opposite side. The central mountain is small and difficult to see.\r\nAbout 20 miles N.E. of Lassell is a remarkable mountain group associated\r\nwith a bright crater, and further on in the same direction is a light\r\noval area, about 10 miles across, with a crater (Alpetragius _d_) on its\r\nS. edge. Madler described this area as a bright crater, 5 miles in\r\ndiameter, which now it certainly is not.\r\n\r\nLALANDE.--A very deep ring-plain, about 14 miles in diameter, N.E. of\r\nPtolemaeus, with bright terraced walls, some 6000 feet above the floor,\r\nwhich contains a low central mountain. On the N. is the long cleft\r\nrunning, with some interruptions, in a W.N.W. direction towards Reaumur.\r\n\r\nDAVY.--A deep irregular ring-plain, 23 miles across, on the Mare E. of\r\nAlphonsus. There is a deep crater with a bright rim on its S.W. wall, and\r\nE. of this a notable gap. There is also a wide opening on the N. The E.\r\nwall is of the linear type. A cleft crosses the interior.\r\n\r\nGUERIKE.--The most southerly member of a remarkable group of partially\r\ndestroyed walled-plains, standing in an isolated position in the Mare\r\nNubium. Its border, on the W. and N. especially, is much broken, and\r\nnever rises much more than 2000 feet above the Mare, except at one place\r\non the N., where there is a mountain about 1000 feet higher. The E. wall\r\nis tolerably continuous, but is of a very abnormal shape. On the S. there\r\nis a peculiar LAMBDA-shaped gap (with a bright crater, and another less\r\nprominent on the E. side of it), the narrowest part of which opens into a\r\nlong wide winding valley, bounded by low hills, extending to the W. side\r\nof a bright ring-plain, Guerike B, on the S.E. A crater-chain occupies\r\nthe centre of this valley. There is much detail within Guerike. A large\r\ndeep bright crater stands under the E. border on a mound, which,\r\ngradually narrowing in width, extends to the N. wall; and a rill-like\r\nvalley runs from the N. border towards the E. side of the LAMBDA-shaped\r\ngap. In addition to these features, there is a shallow rimmed crater,\r\nabout midway between the extremities of the rill-valley, and several\r\nminor elevations on the floor.\r\n\r\nOn the broken N. flank of Guerike is a number of incomplete little rings,\r\nall open to the N.; and E. of these commences a linear group of lofty\r\nisolated mountain masses extending towards the W. side of Parry, and\r\nprolonged for 30 miles or more towards the north. They are arranged in\r\nparallel rows, and remind one of a Druidical avenue of gigantic monoliths\r\nviewed from above. They terminate on the S. side of a large bright\r\nincomplete ring (with a lofty W. wall), connected with the W. side of\r\nParry.\r\n\r\nPARRY.--A more complete formation than Guerike. It is about 25 miles in\r\ndiameter, and is encompassed by a bright border, which, at a point on the\r\nE., is nearly 5000 feet in height. It is intersected on the N. by passes\r\ncommunicating with the interior of Fra Mauro. There is a crater, nearly\r\ncentral, on the dusky interior, which, under a low sun, when the shadows\r\nof the serrated crest of the W. wall reach about half-way across the\r\nfloor, appears to be the centre of three or four concentric ridges, which\r\nat this phase are traceable on the E. side of it. There is a conspicuous\r\ncrater on the E. wall, below which originates a distinct cleft. This\r\nobject skirts the inner foot of the E. border, and after traversing the\r\nN. wall, strikes across the wide expanse of Fra Mauro, and is ultimately\r\nlost in the region N. of this formation. Parry A, S. of Parry, is a very\r\ndeep brilliant crater with a central hill and surrounded by a glistening\r\nhalo. A cleft, originating at a mountain arm connected with the E. side\r\nof Guerike, runs to the S. flank of this object, and is probably\r\nconnected with that which skirts the floor of Parry on the E.\r\n\r\nBONPLAND.--A ruined walled-plain with a low and much broken wall, which\r\non the S.W. appears to be an attenuated prolongation of that of Parry. It\r\nis of the linear type, the formation approximating in shape to that of a\r\npentagon. The floor is crossed from N. to S. by a fine cleft which\r\noriginates at a crater beyond the S. wall, and is visible as a light\r\nstreak under a high light. Schmidt shows a short cleft on the W. of this.\r\n\r\nFRA MAURO.--A large enclosure of irregular shape, at least 50 miles from\r\nside to side, abutting on Parry and Bonpland. In addition to the cleft\r\nwhich crosses it, the floor is traversed by a great number of ridges, and\r\nincludes at least seven craters.\r\n\r\nTHEBIT.--A fine ring-plain, 32 miles in diameter, on the mountainous W.\r\nmargin of the Mare Nubium, N.E. of Purbach. Its irregular rampart is\r\nprominently terraced, and its continuity on the N.E. interrupted by a\r\nlarge deep crater (Thebit A), at least 9 miles in diameter, which has in\r\nits turn a smaller crater, of about half this size, on its margin, and a\r\nsmall central mountain within, which was once considered a good optical\r\ntest, though it is not a difficult object in a 4 inch achromatic, if it\r\nis looked for at a favourable phase. The border of Thebit rises at one\r\nplace on the N.W. to a height of nearly 10,000 feet above the interior,\r\nwhich includes much detail. The E. wall of Thebit A attains the same\r\nheight above its floor, which is depressed more than 5000 feet below the\r\nMare.\r\n\r\nBIRT.--This ring-plain, about 12 miles in diameter, is situated on the\r\nMare Nubium, some distance due E. of Thebit. It has a brilliant border,\r\nsurmounted by peaks rising more than 2000 feet above the Mare, and a very\r\ndepressed floor, which does not appear to contain any visible detail. A\r\nbright crater adjoins it on the S.W., the wall of which at the point of\r\njunction is clearly very low, so that under oblique light the two\r\ninteriors appear to communicate by a narrow pass or neck filled with\r\nshadow. I have frequently seen a break in the N.W. wall of Birt, which\r\nseems to indicate the presence of a crater. There is a noteworthy cleft\r\non the E., which can be traced from the foot of the E. wall to the hills\r\non the N.E. It is a fine telescopic object, and, under some conditions,\r\nthe wider portion of it resembles a railway cutting traversing rising\r\nground, seen from above. It is visible as a white line under a high\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nTHE STRAIGHT WALL.--Sometimes called \"the railroad,\" is a remarkable and\r\nalmost unique formation on the W. side of Birt, extending for about 65\r\nmiles from N.E. to S.W. in a nearly straight line, terminating on the\r\nsouth at a very peculiar mountain group, the shape of which has been\r\ncompared to a stag's horn, but which perhaps more closely resembles a\r\nsword-handle,--the wall representing the blade. When examined under\r\nsuitable conditions, the latter is seen to be slightly curved, the S.\r\nhalf bending to the west, and the remainder the opposite way. The\r\nformation is not a ridge, but is clearly due to a sudden change in the\r\nlevel of the surface, and thus has the outward characteristics of a\r\n\"fault\" Along the upper edge of this gigantic cliff (which, though\r\nmeasures differ, cannot be anywhere much less than 500 feet high) I have\r\nseen at different times many small craterlets and mounds. Near its N. end\r\nis a large crater, and on the W. is a row of hillocks, running at right\r\nangles to the cliff. No observer should fail to examine the wall under a\r\nsetting sun when the nearly perpendicular E. face of the cliff is\r\nbrilliantly illuminated.\r\n\r\nNICOLLET.--A conspicuous little ring-plain on the E. of Birt, and\r\nsomewhat smaller. Between the two is a still smaller crater, from near\r\nwhich runs a low mountain range, nearly parallel to the straight wall, to\r\nthe region S.E. of the Stag's Horn Mountains. Here will be found three\r\nsmall light-surrounded craters arranged in a triangle, with a somewhat\r\nlarger crater in the middle.\r\n\r\nPURBACH.--An immense enclosure of irregular shape, approximating to that\r\nof a rhomboid with slightly curved sides. It is fully 60 miles across,\r\nand the walls in places exceed 8000 feet in altitude, and include many\r\ndepressions, large and small. On the E. inner slope are some fine\r\nterraces and several craters. The continuity of the circumvallation is\r\nbroken on the N. by a great ring-plain, on the floor of which I have seen\r\na prominent cleft and a crater near the S. side. There is a large bright\r\ncrater in the interior of Purbach, S. of the centre, two others on the W.\r\nhalf of the floor, and a few ridges.\r\n\r\nREGIOMONTANUS.--A still more irregular walled-plain, of about the same\r\narea, closely associated with the S. flank of Purbach, having a rampart\r\nof a similar complex type, traversed by passes, longitudinal valleys, and\r\nother depressions. Schmidt alone shows the especially fine example of a\r\ncrater-row, which is not a difficult object, in connection with the S.E.\r\nwall. Excepting one crater, nearly central, and some inconspicuous\r\nridges, I have seen no detail on the floor. Schmidt, however, records\r\nmany features.\r\n\r\nWALTER.--A great rhomboidal walled-plain, 100 miles in diameter, with a\r\nconsiderably depressed floor, enclosed by a rampart of a very complex\r\nkind, crowned by numerous peaks, one of which, on the W., rises 10,000\r\nfeet above the interior. If the formation is observed when it is close to\r\nthe morning terminator, say, when the latter lies from l deg. to 2 deg.\r\nE. of the centre of the floor, it is one of the most striking and\r\nbeautiful objects which the lunar observer can scrutinize. The inner\r\nslope of the border which abuts on Regiomontanus, examined at this phase\r\nunder a high power, is seen to be pitted with an inconceivable number of\r\nminute craters; and the summit ridge, and the region towards Werner,\r\nscalloped in a very extraordinary way, the engrailing (to use an heraldic\r\nterm) being due to the presence of a row of big depressions. The floor at\r\nthis phase is sufficiently illuminated to disclose some of its most\r\nnoteworthy features. Taking its area to be about 8000 square miles, at\r\nleast 1200 square miles of it is occupied by the central mountain group\r\nand its adjuncts, the highest peak rising to a height of nearly 5000 feet\r\n(or nearly 600 feet higher than Ben Nevis), above the interior, and\r\nthrowing a fine spire of shadow thereon. In the midst of this central\r\nboss are two deep craters, one being about 10 miles in diameter, and a\r\nnumber of shallower depressions. In association with the loftiest peak, I\r\nnoted at 8 h., March 9, 1889, two brilliant little craters, which\r\npresumably are not far from the summit. Near the E. corner of the floor\r\nthere is another large deep crater, and, ranging in a line from the\r\ncentre to the S.E. wall, three smaller craters.\r\n\r\nLEXELL.--On the E. of Walter extends an immense plain of irregular\r\noutline, which is at least equal to it in area. Though no large formation\r\nis found thereon; many ridges, short crater-rows, and ordinary craters\r\nfigure on its rugged superficies; and on its borders stand some very\r\nnoteworthy objects, among them, on the S., the walled-plain Lexell, about\r\n32 miles in diameter, which presents many points of interest. Its\r\nirregular wall, rising, at one point on the S.W., to a height of nearly\r\n8000 feet, is on the N.W. almost completely wanting, only very faint\r\nindications of its site being traceable, even under a low morning sun. On\r\nthe opposite side it is boldly terraced, and has a large crater on its\r\nsummit. The interior, the tone of which is conspicuously darker than that\r\nof the region outside, contains a small central hill, with two craters\r\nconnected with it. The low N.W. margin is traversed by a delicate valley,\r\nwhich, originating on the N. side of the great plain, crosses the W.\r\nquarter of Lexell and terminates apparently on the S.W. side of the\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\nHELL.--A prominent ring-plain, about 18 miles in diameter, on the E. side\r\nof the great plain. There is a central mountain and many ridges within.\r\n\r\nBALL.--A somewhat smaller ring-plain on the S.E. edge of the great plain,\r\nwith a lofty terraced border and a central mountain more than 2000 feet\r\nhigh. There are two large irregular depressions on the W. of the\r\nformation, a crater on the S., and a smaller one on the N. wall.\r\n\r\nPITATUS.--This remarkable object, 58 miles in diameter, with Hesiodus,\r\nits companion on the E., situated at the extreme S. end of the Mare\r\nNubium, afford good examples of a class of formations which exhibit\r\nundoubted signs of partial destruction, from some unknown cause, on that\r\nside of them which faces the Mare. On every side but the N., Pitatus is a\r\nwalled plain of an especially massive type, the border on the S.E.\r\nfurnishing one of the finest examples of terraces to be found on the\r\nvisible surface. On the S.W., two parallel rows of large crateriform\r\ndepressions, perhaps the most remarkable of their kind, extend for 60\r\nmiles or more to the W. flank of Gauricus. On the N.W., the rampart\r\nincludes many curious irregular depressions and craters, and gradually\r\ndiminishes in height, till, for a space of about 12 miles on the N.,\r\nthere can hardly be said to be any border at all, its site being marked\r\nby some inconsiderable mounds and shallow hollows. There is a small\r\nbright central mountain on the floor, and, S. of it, two larger but lower\r\nelevations. A distinct straight cleft traverses the N.W. side of the\r\ninterior very near the wall, to which it forms an apparent chord, and a\r\nsecond cleft occupies a similar position with respect to the bright N.E.\r\nborder. A narrow pass forms a communication with the interior of\r\nHesiodus.\r\n\r\nHESIODUS.--This walled-plain, little more than half the diameter of the\r\nlast, has an irregular outline, and for the most part linear walls, which\r\non the S. are massive and lofty (4000 feet), but on the N. very low, and\r\nbroken by gaps. There is a fine deep crater on the S. border, and a small\r\nbut distinct crater on the floor, nearly central, the only object thereon\r\nwhich I have seen, though Schmidt draws a smaller one on the W. of it.\r\n\r\nA mountain abutting on the N.E. side of Hesiodus is the W. origin of one\r\nof the longest clefts on the moon. Running in an E.S.E. direction, it\r\ntraverses the Mare to a crater near the W. face of the Cichus mountain\r\narm, reappears on the E. side of this object, and is finally lost amid\r\nthe hills on the N. of Capuanus. The W. section of this cleft is coarser\r\nand much more distinct than that lying E. of the mountain arm.\r\n\r\nGAURICUS.--A large walled-plain S. of Pitatus, about 40 miles in\r\ndiameter. The border is very irregular, and, according to Neison,\r\nconsists on the E. of a precipitous cliff more than 9000 feet high. It is\r\nsurrounded by a number of large rings on the S., and has several\r\nconsiderable small depressions on its N. border. There is apparently no\r\nprominent detail on the floor. Schmidt shows some ridges and craterlets.\r\n\r\nWURZELBAUER.--Another irregular walled-plain, about 50 miles in diameter,\r\non the S.E. of Pitatus, with a very complex border, in connection with\r\nwhich, on the S.W., is a group of fine depressions, and on the S.E. a\r\nlarge crater. There is much detail on the very uneven floor.\r\n\r\nMILLER.--One of a group of three moderately large ring-plains, of which\r\nNasireddin is a member, near the central meridian in S. latitude 39 deg.\r\nIts massive border rises nearly 11,000 feet above the floor, on which\r\nstands a central peak. Miller is about 36 miles in diameter.\r\n\r\nNASIREDDIN.--A somewhat smaller ring-plain on the S. of the last, and of\r\na very similar type. It contains a central peak and several minor\r\nelevations. Between its N.W. border and the S.W. flank of Miller is a\r\nsmaller ring-plain of about half the size of Nasireddin, and on the S.E.\r\na large enclosure named HUGGINS.\r\n\r\nORONTIUS.--Huggins has encroached on the W. side of this irregular ring-\r\nplain and overlaps it. It is of considerable size. The floor includes\r\nmuch detail and a prominent crater.\r\n\r\nSASSERIDES.--A formation of irregular shape, with very lofty walls,\r\nsituated amid the confusion of ring-plains, craters, crater-pits, &c., in\r\nthe region N. of Tycho, some of which are fully as deserving of a\r\ndistinct name.\r\n\r\nHEINSIUS.--A very curious formation on the N.E. of Tycho: a fine\r\ntelescopic object under oblique illumination. It has an irregular but\r\ncontinuous border, except on the S., where two large ring-plains have\r\nencroached upon it, and a third, N. of a line joining their centres,\r\noccupies no inconsiderable portion of the floor. Heinsius is nearly 50\r\nmiles across, and the border on the W., is nearly 9000 feet above the\r\ninterior, which includes, at least, three small craters. The walls of the\r\nintrusive ring-plains have craters on their summits; the more westerly\r\nhas two on the W., and its companion, one on the S.W. The ring-plain on\r\nthe floor has a crater on its E. wall. Schmidt shows a small crater\r\nbetween the ring-plains on the S. border.\r\n\r\nSAUSSURE.--A ring-plain W. of Tycho, 28 miles in diameter, with bright\r\nlofty terraced walls and a somewhat dark interior, on which there is a\r\ncrater, W. of the centre, and some crater-pits. There are several large\r\ndepressions on the S.W. wall. It is surrounded by formations which,\r\nthough nearly as prominent as itself, have not, with the exception of\r\nPictet on the E., and one on the N.W., called Huggins by Schmidt,\r\nreceived distinctive names. The region W. of Saussure abounds in\r\ncraterlets, some of which are of the minutest type. One of the Tycho\r\nstreaks is manifestly deflected from its course by this formation, and\r\nanother is faintly traceable on the floor.\r\n\r\nPICTET.--A walled-plain of irregular shape, about 30 miles across,\r\nbetween Saussure and Tycho, with a border broken on the S. by a large\r\nconspicuous ring-plain, which is at least 10 miles in diameter, and,\r\naccording to Schmidt, has a central mountain. Schmidt draws the S.E.\r\nborder of Pictet as broken by ridges extending on to the floor. He also\r\nshows several craters and minor elevations thereon.\r\n\r\nTYCHO.--As the centre from which the principal bright ray-system of the\r\nmoon radiates, and the most conspicuous object in the southern\r\nhemisphere, this noble ring-plain may justly claim the pre-eminent title\r\nof \"the Metropolitan crater.\" It is more than 54 miles in diameter, and\r\nits massive border, everywhere traversed by terraces and variegated by\r\ndepressions within and without, is surmounted by peaks rising both on the\r\nE. and W. to a height of about 17,000 feet above the bright interior, on\r\nwhich stands a magnificent central mountain at least 5000 feet in\r\naltitude. Were it not somewhat foreshortened, Tycho would be seen to\r\ndeviate considerably from what is deemed to be the normal shape. On the\r\nS. and W. especially, the wall approximates to the linear type, no signs\r\nof curvature being apparent where these sections meet. The crest on the\r\nS. and S.E. exhibits many breaks and irregularities; and it is through a\r\nnarrow gap on the S. that a rill-like valley, originating at a small\r\ndepression near the foot of the S.W. _glacis_, passes, and, descending\r\nthe inner slope of the S.E. wall obliquely, terminates near its foot.\r\nThere is a distinct crater on the summit ridge on the S.E., and another\r\nbelow the crest on the outer S.W. slope. On the S. inner slope I have\r\noften remarked a number of bright oval objects, which, for the lack of a\r\nbetter word, may be termed \"mounds\" though they represent masses of\r\nmaterial many miles in length and breadth. The outer slope of Tycho,\r\nexhibiting under a high light a grey nimbus encircling the wall,\r\nincludes--craters, crater-pits, shallow valleys, spurs and buttresses--in\r\nshort, almost every variety of lunar feature is represented. Excepting\r\nthe central mountain and a crater on the W. of it, I have not seen any\r\nobject on the floor, which, for some unexplained reason, is never very\r\ndistinct. Schmidt shows several low ridges on the N.E. side. In a paper\r\nrecently published in the _Astronomische Nachrichten_, Professor W.H.\r\nPickering, describing his observations of the Tycho streaks made at\r\nArequipa, Peru, with a 13 inch achromatic, asserts that they do not\r\nradiate from the centre of Tycho, but from a multitude of minute craters\r\non its S.E. or N. rim. (See Introduction.)\r\n\r\nMAGINUS.--An immense partially ruined enclosure, at least 100 miles from\r\nside to side, on the S.W. of Tycho, from which it is separated by a\r\nregion covered with a confused mass of ring-plains and craters. On almost\r\nevery part of its broken border stand large ring-plains, many of which,\r\nif they were isolated, or situated in a less disturbed region, would rank\r\nas objects of importance; but among such a multitude of features they\r\npass unnoticed. The largest of them occupies no inconsiderable part of\r\nthe S.E. wall, and is quite 30 miles in diameter, its own border being\r\nalso much broken by depressions, as, indeed, are those of almost all the\r\nsix or more large ring-plains which define the N. limits of Maginus. The\r\nloftiest portion of what remains of a true border rises at one place to\r\nmore than 14,000 feet. On the floor, which is traversed by some of the\r\nTycho rays, there is a mountain group associated with a crater, nearly\r\ncentral, and several large rings on the N. side. Though the formation is\r\nvery difficult to detect under a high sun, Madler's dictum that \"the full\r\nmoon knows no Maginus\" is not strictly true.\r\n\r\nSTREET.--A walled-plain between Tycho and Maginus, about 28 miles in\r\ndiameter, with a border of moderate height, broken by depressions on the\r\nN. There are some small craters and ridges within; but the surrounding\r\nregion, with its almost endless variety of abnormally shaped formations,\r\nis far more worthy of the observer's attention.\r\n\r\nDELUC.--The largest and most prominent member of a curious group of ring-\r\nplains on the S.W. of Maginus. It is about 28 miles in diameter, and is\r\nencircled by a wall some 7000 feet above the interior, which includes a\r\ncrater. A large ring with a central mountain encroaches on the N. wall,\r\nand a smaller object of the same class on the S. wall.\r\n\r\nCLAVIUS.--There are few lunar observers who have not devoted more or less\r\nattention to this beautiful formation, one of the most striking of\r\ntelescopic objects. However familiar we may consider ourselves to be with\r\nits features, there is always something fresh to note and to admire as\r\noften as we examine its apparently inexhaustible details. It is 142 miles\r\nfrom side to side, and includes an area of at least 16,000 square miles\r\nwithin its irregular circumvallation, which is only comparatively\r\nslightly elevated above the bright plateau on the W., though it stands at\r\nleast 12,000 feet above the depressed floor. At a point on the S.W. a\r\npeak rises nearly 17,000 feet above the interior, while on the E. the\r\ncliffs are almost as lofty. There are two remarkable ring-plains, each\r\nabout 25 miles in diameter, associated, one with the N., and the other\r\nwith the S. wall, the floors of both abounding in detail. The latter,\r\nhowever, is the most noteworthy on account of the curious corrugations\r\nvisible soon after sunrise on the outer N. slope of its wall, resembling\r\nthe ribbed flanks of some of the Java volcanoes. There are five large\r\ncraters on the floor of Clavius, following a curve convex to the N., and\r\ndiminishing in size from W. to E. The most westerly stands nearly midway\r\nbetween the two large ring-plains on the walls, the second (about two-\r\nthirds its area) is associated with a complex group of hills and smaller\r\ncraters. Both these objects have central mountains. In addition to this\r\nprominent chain, there are innumerable craters of a smaller type on the\r\nfloor, but they are more plentiful on the S. half than elsewhere. On the\r\nS.E. wall are three very large depressions. On the broad massive N.E.\r\nborder, the bright summit ridge and the many transverse valleys running\r\ndown from it to the floor, are especially interesting features. There are\r\nvery clear indications of \"faulting\" on a vast scale where this broad\r\nsection of the wall abuts on the N. side of the formation.\r\n\r\nCYSATUS.--A regular walled-plain, apparently about 28 miles in diameter,\r\nforming the most northerly member of a chain of formations, of which\r\nNewton, Short, and Moretus, extending towards the S. limb, form a part.\r\nIts border rises nearly 13,000 feet above a floor devoid of prominent\r\ndetail.\r\n\r\nGRUEMBERGER.--A much larger and more irregular ring-plain, nearly 40\r\nmiles from wall to wall, on the E. side of Cysatus. Its W. border rises\r\nnearly 14,000 feet above the interior, which includes an abnormally deep\r\ncrater, the bottom of which is 20,000 feet below the crest of the W.\r\nwall, and several small depressions and ridges. The inner E. slope is\r\nfinely terraced.\r\n\r\nMORETUS.--A magnificent object, 78 miles in diameter, but foreshortened\r\ninto a flat ellipse. Its beautifully terraced walls and magnificent\r\ncentral mountain, nearly 7000 feet high, are very conspicuous under\r\nsuitable conditions. The rampart on the E. is more than 15,000 feet above\r\nthe floor, while on the opposite side it is about 5000 feet lower.\r\n\r\nSHORT.--A fine but foreshortened ring-plain of oblong shape, squeezed in\r\nbetween Moretus and Newton. It is about 30 miles in diameter, and on the\r\nS.E., where its border and that of Newton are in common, it rises nearly\r\n17,000 feet above the interior, which includes, according to Neison, a\r\nsmall central hill. Schmidt shows a crater on the N. side of the floor.\r\n\r\nNEWTON.--Is situated on the S.E. side of Short, and is the deepest\r\nwalled-plain on the visible surface. It is of irregular form and about\r\n143 miles in extreme length. One gigantic peak on the E. rises to nearly\r\n24,000 feet above the floor, the greater part of which is always immersed\r\nin shadow, so that neither the earth or sun can at any time be seen from\r\nit.\r\n\r\nMALAPERT.--A ring-plain situated far too near the limb for useful\r\nobservation. Between it and Newton is a number of abnormally shaped\r\nenclosures.\r\n\r\nCABEUS.--Another object out of the range of satisfactory scrutiny. Madler\r\nconsidered that it is as deep as Newton. According to Neison, a central\r\npeak and two craters can be seen within under favourable conditions.\r\nSchmidt draws a long row of great depressions on the N. side of it.\r\n\r\n\r\nEAST LONGITUDE 20 deg. TO 40  deg.\r\n\r\n\r\nLANDSBERG.--A ring-plain, about 28 miles in diameter, situated in Mare\r\nNubium, S.E. of Reinhold, which in many respects it resembles. Its\r\nregular massive border is everywhere continuous. Only a solitary crater\r\nbreaks the uniformity of its crest, that rises on the W. to nearly 10,000\r\nfeet, and on the E. to about 7000 feet above the floor, which is\r\ndepressed about 7000 feet below the surrounding surface. The inner slopes\r\nexhibit some fine terraces, and on the broad W. _glacis_ is a curious\r\nwinding valley, which runs up the slope from the S.W. side to the crater\r\njust mentioned, then, bending downwards, joins the plain at the foot of\r\nthe N. wall. Neither this nor the crater is shown in the maps. The large\r\ncompound central peak is apparently the sole object in the interior. At 8\r\nh. 25 m. on January 23, 1888, when observing the progress of sunrise on\r\nthis formation with a 8 1/2 inch Calver-reflector charged with different\r\neyepieces, I noticed, when about three-fourths of the floor was in\r\nshadow, that the illuminated portion of it was of a dark chocolate hue,\r\nstrongly contrasting with the grey tone of the surrounding district. This\r\nappearance lasted till the interior was more than half illuminated,\r\ngradually becoming less pronounced as the sun rose higher on the ring. E.\r\nand S.E. of Landsberg is a number of ring-plains and craters well worthy\r\nof careful examination. Five of the largest are surrounded by a\r\nglistening halo, and one (that nearest to the formation) and another (the\r\nlargest of the group) have each a minute crater on their N. wall.\r\n\r\nEUCLIDES.--One of the most brilliant objects on the moon; a crater 7\r\nmiles in diameter, standing on a large bright area in the Mare\r\nProcellarum, E. of the Riphaean Mountains. Its E. rim rises nearly 2000\r\nfeet above the bright depressed floor; on the W. there is a bright little\r\nunrecorded crater.\r\n\r\nWICHMANN.--This bright crater, about 5 miles in diameter, stands on a\r\nlight area in Oceanus Procellarum, N.N.W. of Letronne and nearly due E.\r\nof Euclides. Some distance on the N.E. are the relics of what appears\r\nonce to have been a large enclosure, represented now by a few isolated\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\nHERIGONIUS.--A ring-plain, about 7 miles in diameter, in the Mare\r\nProcellarum, N.W. of Gassendi. There is a small crater a few miles S.E.\r\nof it, among the bright little mountains which flank this formation.\r\nHerigonius has a small central mountain, which is a good test for\r\nmoderate apertures.\r\n\r\nGASSENDI.--One of the most beautiful telescopic objects on the moon's\r\nvisible surface, and structurally one of the most interesting and\r\nsuggestive. It is a walled-plain, 55 miles in diameter, of a distinctly\r\npolygonal type, the N.W. and S.W. sections being practically straight,\r\nwhile the intermediate W. section exhibits a slightly convex curvature,\r\nor bulging in towards the interior. There is also much angularity about\r\nthe E. side, which is evident at an early stage of sunrise. The wall on\r\nthe N. is broken through and almost completely wrecked by the great ring-\r\nplain Gassendi A. The bright eastern section of the border is in places\r\nvery lofty, rising at one peak, N. of the well-known triangular\r\ndepression upon it, to 9000 feet, and at other peaks on the same side\r\nstill higher. It is very low on the S., being only about 500 feet above\r\nthe surface. The floor, however, on the N. stands 2000 feet above the\r\nMare Humorum. On the W. there is a peak towering 4000 feet above the\r\nwall, which is here about 5000 feet above the floor, and 8000 feet above\r\nthe Mare Nubium. A very notable feature in connection with this formation\r\nis the little bright plain bounding it on the N.W., and separated from it\r\nby merely a narrow strip of wall. This enclosure is flanked on the N.E.\r\nby Gassendi A, and on the S.W. and N.W. by a coarse winding ridge,\r\nrunning from the W. wall and terminating at a large irregular dusky\r\ndepression. Gaudibert has detected a crater near the S.E. edge of this\r\nbright plain, which includes also some oval mounds. The interior of\r\nGassendi is without question unrivalled for the variety of its details,\r\nand, after Plato, has perhaps received more attention from observers than\r\nany other object. The bright central mountain, or rather mountains, for\r\nit consists of a number of grouped masses crowned by peaks, of which the\r\nloftiest is about 4000 feet, is one of the finest on the moon. It was\r\ncarefully studied with a 6 1/4 inch Cooke-achromatic by the late\r\nProfessor Phillips, the geologist, who compared it to the dolomitic or\r\ntrachytic mountains of the earth. The buttresses and spurs which it\r\nthrows out give its base a digitated outline, easily seen under suitable\r\nillumination. There are between 30 and 40 clefts in the interior, the\r\nmajority being confined to the S.W. quarter of the floor. Those most\r\neasily seen pertain to the group which radiates from the central mountain\r\ntowards the S.W. wall. They are all more or less difficult objects,\r\nrequiring exceptionally favourable weather and high powers. A fine\r\nmountain range, the Percy Mountains, is connected with the E. flank of\r\nGassendi, extending in a S.E. direction towards Mersenius, and defining\r\nthe N.E. side of the Mare Humorum.\r\n\r\nBULLIALDUS.--A noble object, 38 miles in diameter, forming with its\r\nsurroundings by far the most notable formation on the surface of the Mare\r\nNubium, and one of the most characteristic ring-plains on the moon. It\r\nshould be observed about the time when the morning terminator lies on the\r\nW. border of the Mare Humorum, as at this phase the best view is obtained\r\nof the two deep parallel terrace valleys which run round the bright inner\r\nslope of the E. wall, of the crater-row against which they abut on the\r\nS.E., and of the massive W. _glacis_, with its spurs and depressions. The\r\nS. border of Bullialdus has been manifestly modified by the presence of\r\nthe great ring-plain A, a deep irregular formation with linear walls,\r\nwhich is connected with it by a shallow valley. The rampart of Bullialdus\r\nrises about 8000 feet above a concave floor, which sinks some 4000 feet\r\nbelow the Mare on the E. With the exception of the fine compound central\r\nmountain, 3000 feet high, there are few details in the interior. On the\r\nS., is the fine ring-plain B, connected with the S.E. wall near the\r\ncrater-row by a well-marked valley, and nearly due E. of B is another, a\r\nsquare-shaped enclosure, C, with a very lofty little mountain on the E.\r\nside of it, and a crater on its S. wall. In addition to these features,\r\nthere are many ridges and surface inequalities, very prominent under\r\noblique illumination.\r\n\r\nLUBINIEZKY.--A regular enclosure, about 23 miles in diameter, N.E. of\r\nBullialdus, with a low attenuated border, which is nowhere more than 1000\r\nfeet in height. It is tolerably continuous, except on the S., where there\r\nare two or three breaks. Its level dark interior presents no details to\r\nvary its monotony. Close under the N.W. wall is a small crater connected\r\nwith it by a ridge, and E. of this a very rugged area, traversed in every\r\ndirection by narrow shallow valleys, which are well worth looking at when\r\nclose to the morning terminator. A bright spur projects from the N. wall\r\nof Lubiniezky.\r\n\r\nKIES.--A somewhat similar formation, S. of Bullialdus, about 25 miles in\r\ndiameter, also encircled by a border of insignificant dimensions,\r\nattaining an altitude of 2400 feet at only one point on the S.E., while\r\nelsewhere it is scarcely higher than that of Lubiniezky. It is clearly\r\npolygonal, approximating to the hexagonal type. On the more distinct S.\r\nsection a bright spur projects from it. On the N. its continuity is\r\nbroken by a distinct little crater. It is traversed by a remarkable white\r\nstreak, extending in a S.W. direction from Bullialdus C (where it is very\r\nwide), across the interior, to the more westerly of two craters S.W. of\r\nMercator. Another streak branches out from it near the centre of the\r\nfloor, and runs to the W. wall. The principal streak, so far as the\r\nportion within Kies is concerned, represents a cleft. On the Mare E. of\r\nKies is a curious circular mound, and farther towards Campanus two\r\nprominent little mountains. On the N.W. is a large obscure ring and a\r\nwide shallow valley bordered by ridges.\r\n\r\nAGATHARCHIDES.--A very irregular complex ring-plain, about 28 miles in\r\ndiameter, forming part of the N.W. side of the Mare Humorum. It must be\r\nobserved under many phases before one can clearly comprehend its\r\ndistinctive features. The wall is very deficient on the N., but is\r\nrepresented in places by bright mountain masses. The formation is flanked\r\non the E. by a double rampart, which is at one place more than 5000 feet\r\nin height, with a deep intervening valley. The S. wall is traversed by a\r\nnumber of parallel valleys, all trending towards Hippalus. These are\r\nincluded in a much wider and longer chasm, which, gradually diminishing\r\nin breadth, extends up to the N. wall of the latter.\r\n\r\nHIPPALUS.--A partially ruined walled-plain, about 38 miles in diameter,\r\non the W. side of the Mare Humorum, S. of Agatharchides. At least one-\r\nthird of the border is wanting on the S.E., but under a low sun its site\r\ncan be distinguished by a faint marking and the obvious difference in\r\ntone between the dark interior and the lighter-coloured plain. The rest\r\nof the wall is bright and continuous, except at a place on the W., where\r\nwhat appears to be the segment of a large ring has encroached upon it.\r\nThere are two craters in the interior of Hippalus, and a row of parallel\r\nridges, running obliquely from the S.W. wall up to a cleft which\r\ntraverses the floor from N. to S. W. of Hippalus stands a bright crater,\r\nHippalus A, with an incomplete little ring-plain adjoining it on the\r\nN.W.; and N.E. of it a much larger obscure ring containing two little\r\nhills. The Hippalus rill-system is a very interesting one, and the\r\ngreater part of it can, moreover, be easily traced in a good 4 inch\r\nachromatic. It originates in the rugged region E. of Campanus, from which\r\nfive nearly parallel curved clefts extend up to the rocky barrier,\r\nconnecting the N. side of this formation with the S.W. side of Hippalus.\r\nThe most westerly of these furrows is interrupted by a crater on this\r\nwall, but reappears on the N. side of it, and, after making a detour\r\ntowards the W. to avoid a little mountain in its path, runs partially\r\nround the E. flank of Hippalus A, and then, continuing its northerly\r\ncourse, terminates amid the mountains W. of Agatharchides. (A short\r\nparallel cleft runs E. of this from the little mountain to the E. side of\r\nA.) The most easterly member of the system, originating N. of Ramsden,\r\nenters Hippalus at the S. side of the great gap in the border, and, after\r\ntraversing the floor at the W. foot of a ridge thereon, also extends\r\ntowards the mountains W. of Agatharchides. Between these clefts are three\r\nintermediate furrows, one of which runs N. from the N. side of the\r\nencroaching ring already referred to, on the W. wall of Hippalus.\r\n\r\nCAMPANUS.--A ring-plain, 30 miles in diameter, on the rocky barrier,\r\nextending in nearly a straight line from Hippalus to Cichus. Its terraced\r\nwalls, which rise on the E. more than 6000 feet above the floor, are\r\nbroken on the S. by a narrow valley, and on the E. by a small crater. A\r\nsmall central mountain is apparently the only object on a very dark\r\ninterior.\r\n\r\nMERCATOR.--A more irregular ring-plain of about the same area, adjoining\r\nCampanus on the S.W. Its rampart is somewhat lower, and is partially\r\nbroken on the N. by two semi-rings, and on the S. by a gap. The E. wall\r\nextends on the S. far beyond the limits of the formation, and terminates\r\nin a brilliant mountain mass 6000 feet in height. There is a bright\r\ncrater on the crest of both the E. and W. border. On the plain E. of\r\nMercator is a remarkable little crater standing on a light area, and,\r\njust under the wall, a dusky pit connected with it by a rill-like\r\nmarking. These objects are of a very doubtful nature, and should be\r\ncarefully observed. The floor of Mercator is much lighter than that of\r\nCampanus, and appears to be devoid of detail.\r\n\r\nCICHUS.--A conspicuous ring-plain, about 20 miles in diameter, with a\r\nprominent deep crater about 6 miles across on its E. rim. It is situated\r\non a curious boot-shaped plateau, near the S. end of the rocky mountain\r\nbarrier associated with the last two formations. Its walls rise about\r\n9000 feet above a sunken floor, on which there is some faint detail, but\r\napparently nothing deserving the distinction of a central mountain. The\r\nplateau on the N. is cut through by a fine broad valley, which has\r\nobviously interfered with a large crateriform depression on its southern\r\nedge. A cleft runs from a small crater W. of the plateau up to this\r\nvalley, and extends beyond to the W. wall of Capuanus. There is also a\r\ndelicate cleft crossing the region S. of Cichus to the group of\r\ncomplicated formations S.W. of Capuanus. As already mentioned, the great\r\nHesiodus cleft is associated with the Cichus plateau.\r\n\r\nCAPUANUS.--A large ring-plain, about 34 miles in diameter, E. of Cichus,\r\nwith a border especially remarkable on the E., where it rises more than\r\n8000 feet above the outside country, and includes a large brilliant\r\nshallow crater. It is broken on the N.W. by a small but noteworthy double\r\ncrater; and on the S. its continuity is destroyed for many miles by a\r\nnumber of big circular and sub-circular depressions and prominent deep\r\nvalleys, far too numerous and complicated to describe. The level dusky\r\ninterior contains only a low mound on the S., but is crossed by some\r\nlight streaks running from N. to S.\r\n\r\nRAMSDEN.--This ring-plain, 12 miles in diameter, derives its importance\r\nfrom the remarkable rill-system with which it is so closely associated.\r\nIts border, about 1800 feet on the W. above the outside surface, is\r\nslightly terraced within on the E., where there is an unrecorded bright\r\ncrater on the slope. The two principal clefts on the S. originate among\r\nthe hills E. of Capuanus. The more easterly begins at a crater on the N.\r\nedge of these objects, and runs N. to the E. side of Ramsden; the other\r\noriginates at a larger crater, and proceeds in a N. direction up to a\r\nbright little mountain S.W. of Ramsden; when, swerving to the N.E., it\r\nends at the W. wall of this formation. This mountain is a centre or node\r\nfrom which three other more delicate branches radiate. On the N., three\r\nof the shortest clefts pertaining to the system are easily traceable from\r\nneighbouring mountains up to the N. wall, which they apparently partially\r\ncut through. The E. pair have a common origin, but open out as they\r\napproach the border of Ramsden.\r\n\r\nVITELLO.--A very peculiar ring-plain, 28 miles in diameter, on the S.\r\nside of the Mare Humorum, remarkable for having another nearly concentric\r\nring-plain, of considerably less altitude within it, and a large bright\r\ncentral boss, overlooking the inner wall, 1700 feet in height. The outer\r\nwall is somewhat irregular, and is broken by gaps and valleys on the S.\r\nand N.W. It rises on the E. about 5000 feet above the Mare, but only\r\nabout 2000 above the interior, which includes a crater on its N. side,\r\nand some low ridges.\r\n\r\nHAINZEL.--This remarkable formation, which is about 55 miles in greatest\r\nlength, but is hardly half so broad, derives its abnormal shape from the\r\npartial coalescence of two nearly equal ring-plains, the walls of both\r\nbeing very lofty,--more than 10,000 feet. It ought to be observed under a\r\nmorning sun when the floor is about half illuminated. At this phase the\r\nextension of the broad bright terraced E. border across a portion of the\r\ninterior is very apparent, and the true structural character of the\r\nformation clearly revealed. The floor abounds in detail, among which, on\r\nthe S., are some large craters and a bright longitudinal ridge. Hainzel\r\nis flanked on the W. and S.W. by a broad plateau, W. of which stand two\r\nring-plains about 15 miles in diameter, both having prominent central\r\nmountains and bright interiors.\r\n\r\nWILHELM I.--A large irregular formation, about 50 miles across, S.E. of\r\nHeinsius, with walls varying very considerably in height, rising more\r\nthan 11,000 feet on the E., but only about 7000 feet on the opposite\r\nside. The border is everywhere crowded with depressions, large and small.\r\nThree ring-plains, not less than 6 miles in diameter, stand upon the S.\r\nwall, the most westerly overlapping its shallower neighbour on the E.,\r\nwhich projects beyond the wall on to the floor. The interior has a very\r\nrugged and uneven surface, upon the N. side of which are two very\r\ndistinct craters, and a short crater-row on the W. of them. It is\r\ntraversed from W. to E. by three bright streaks from Tycho, two on the N.\r\nbeing very prominent under a high light.\r\n\r\nLONGOMONTANUS.--A much larger walled-plain, S. of the last. It is 90\r\nmiles in diameter, with a border much broken by depressions, especially\r\non the N.E. At one peak on this side it rises to the tremendous altitude\r\nof 13,000 feet above the floor, and at peaks on the W. more than 1000\r\nfeet higher. There is a crowd of ring-plains on the N.E. quarter of the\r\ninterior, and some hills and craterlets in other parts of it. It is also\r\ncrossed by rays from Tycho.\r\n\r\nSCHILLER.--A fine lozenge-shaped enclosure, with a continuous but\r\nsomewhat irregular border. It is about 112 miles in extreme length, and\r\nrather more than half this in breadth. The loftiest section of the wall\r\nis on the W., where it rises 13,000 feet above a considerably depressed\r\ninterior. There is a bright crater on this side and some terraces. On the\r\nbroad inner slope of the E. border, the summit ridge of which is\r\nespecially well-marked, there is a large shallow depression. The floor\r\ncontains scarcely any detail, except some ridges on the N. side and a few\r\ncraterlets. The great bright plain E. of Schiller and the region on the\r\nS.E. are especially worthy of scrutiny under a low morning sun.\r\n\r\nBAYER.--This object, 29 miles in diameter, with a terraced border rising\r\non the W. to a height of 8000 feet above the floor, is so closely\r\nassociated with Schiller, that it may almost be regarded as forming part\r\nof it. A long lofty mountain arm, apparently connected with the W. wall\r\nof the latter, runs from the E. side of Bayer towards the N.W. There is a\r\ncrater on the E. side of the interior.\r\n\r\nROST.--An oblong-shaped ring-plain, 30 miles in diameter, on the S.W. of\r\nSchiller, with moderately high walls, and, according to Neison, a shallow\r\ndepression within, nearly central. I have seen a crater shown by Schmidt\r\non the E. side of the floor. A valley runs from the E. side of Rost to\r\nthe S. of Schiller.\r\n\r\nWEIGEL.--A not very conspicuous ring-plain on the S. of Schiller, with a\r\ncrater on its N.W. rim, and a larger ring adjoining it on the S.E. A\r\nprominent curved mountain arm from the E. wall of Schiller runs towards\r\nthe N. side of this formation.\r\n\r\nBLANCANUS.--A formation, 50 miles in diameter, on the S.E. side of\r\nClavius, whose surpassing beauties tend to render the less remarkable\r\nfeatures of this magnificent ring-plain and those of its neighbour\r\nScheiner less attractive than they otherwise would be. The crest of its\r\nfinely terraced wall, which at one peak on the E. rises to 18,000 feet,\r\nis at least 12,000 feet above the interior. Krieger saw twenty craters on\r\nthe floor (1894, Sept. 21, 13h.), most of them situated on the S.\r\nquarter.\r\n\r\nSCHEINER.--A still larger object, being nearly 70 miles in diameter, with\r\na prominently terraced wall, fully as lofty as that of Blancanus. There\r\nis a large crater, nearly central, two others on the N.E. side of the\r\nfloor, and a fourth at the inner foot of the E. wall. There is also a\r\nshallow ring on the N.E. slope. Schmidt shows, but far too prominently,\r\ntwo straight ridges crossing each other on the S. side of the central\r\ncrater.\r\n\r\nCASATUS.--A large walled-plain, about 50 miles in diameter, S.E. of\r\nBlancanus, near the limb, remarkable for having one of the loftiest\r\nramparts of all known lunar objects; it rises at one peak on the S.W. to\r\nthe great height of 22,285 feet above the floor, while there are other\r\npeaks nearly as high on the N. and S. The wall is broken on the E. by a\r\nfine crater. There is also a crater on the N.W. side of the very\r\ndepressed floor, together with some craterlets.\r\n\r\nKLAPROTH.--Casatus partially overlaps this still larger but less massive\r\nformation on its S.E. flank. The walls of Klaproth are much lower and\r\nvery irregular and broken, especially on the W. There are some ridges on\r\nthe floor. The neighbouring region is covered with unnamed objects, large\r\nand small.\r\n\r\n\r\nEAST LONGITUDE 40 deg. TO 60  deg.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLAMSTEED.--A bright ring-plain, 9 miles in diameter, in a barren region\r\nin the Oceanus Procellarum, N.E. of Wichmann. It has a regular border\r\n(broken at one place on the N. by a gap, which probably represents a\r\ncrater), rising to a height of about 1400 feet above the surrounding\r\nplain. A great enclosure, 60 miles in diameter, lies on the N. of\r\nFlamsteed. It is defined by low ridges which exhibit many breaks, though\r\nunder a high light the ring is apparently continuous. Within are several\r\nsmall craters and two considerable hills, nearly central.\r\n\r\nHERMANN.--A ring-plain, about 10 miles in diameter, in the Oceanus\r\nProcellarum, W. of Lohrmann. It is associated with a group of long\r\nridges, running in a meridional direction and roughly parallel to the\r\ncoast-line.\r\n\r\nLETRONNE.--A magnificent bay or inflexion in the coast-line of the\r\nOceanus Procellarum, N.N.E. of Gassendi, presenting an opening towards\r\nthe N. of nearly 50 miles, and bounded on the S. and S.W. by the lofty\r\nGassendi highlands. Its border on the W., about 3000 feet high, is\r\ncrowned with innumerable small depressions. The interior includes four\r\nbright little mountains, nearly central (three of them forming a\r\ntriangle), a bright crater on the W. side, and several minor elevations\r\nand ridges. On the plain N. of the bay, is a large bright crater, from\r\nwhich a fine curved ridge runs to the central mountains. If Letronne is\r\nobserved under oblique illumination, the low mounds and ridges on the\r\nMare outside impress one with the idea that they represent the remains of\r\na once complete N. wall.\r\n\r\nBILLY.--A ring-plain, 31 miles in diameter, S.E. of Letronne, with a very\r\ndark floor, depressed about 1000 feet below the grey surface on the W.,\r\nand a regular border, rising more than 3000 feet above it. There is a\r\nnarrow gap on the S., and indications of a crater on the N.W. rim. Two\r\nsmall craters stand on the S. half of the interior. The formation is\r\nflanked on the S.W. by highlands.\r\n\r\nHANSTEEN.--A somewhat larger ring-plain, with a lower and more\r\nirregular rampart, rising on the W. to nearly 3000 feet above the\r\nfloor, which is depressed to about the same extent as that of Billy.\r\nBoth the inner and outer slopes are terraced on the E., where the\r\n_glacis_ is traversed by a short, delicate, rill-like valley.\r\nThere are some bright curved ridges on the floor. On the W. of Billy\r\nand Hansteen is a wide inlet of the Oceanus Procellarum, bounded by\r\nthe Letronne region on the W., and on the S. by lofty highlands. On the\r\nsurface, not far from the S.W. border of Hansteen, is a curious\r\ntriangular-shaped mountain mass, with a digitated outline on the S., and\r\nincluding a small bright crater on its area. Between this and the ring-\r\nplain is a large but somewhat obscure depression, N. of which lies a\r\nrill-like object extending from the N. point of the triangular mountain\r\nto the W. wall. At the bottom of a gently sloping valley between Billy\r\nand Hansteen is a delicate marking, which seems to represent a cleft\r\nconnecting the two formations.\r\n\r\nZUPUS.--A formation about 12 miles in diameter with a dark floor,\r\nsituated in the hilly region N.E. of Mersenius.\r\n\r\nFONTANA.--A noteworthy ring-plain, about 20 miles in diameter, E.N.E. of\r\nZupus, with a bright border, exhibiting a narrow gap on the S. and two\r\nlarge contiguous craters on the N.W. The faint central mountain stands on\r\na dusky interior. On the N. is a large peculiar depressed plain with a\r\ngently sloping wall, within which are three short rill-like valleys and a\r\ncrater.\r\n\r\nMERSENIUS.--With its extensive rill-system and interesting surroundings,\r\none of the most notable ring-plains in the third quadrant. It is 41 miles\r\nin diameter, and is encircled by a fine rampart, which on the side\r\nfronting the Mare Humorum rises 7000 feet above the floor, which is\r\ndistinctly convex, and is depressed 3000 feet below the region on the E.,\r\nthough it stands considerably above the level of the Mare. The\r\nprominently terraced border is tolerably regular on the N.W., but on the\r\nS. and S.E. is much broken by craters and depressions, the largest and\r\nmost conspicuous interrupting the continuity of its summit-ridge on the\r\nlatter side. A fine crater-row traverses the central part of the\r\ninterior, nearly axially, and a delicate cleft crosses the N. half of the\r\nfloor from the inner foot of the N.E. wall to a crater not far from the\r\nopposite side. I detected another cleft on November 11, 1883, also\r\ncrossing the N. side of the floor.\r\n\r\nSouth of Mersenius is the fine ring-plain Mersenius _d_, about 20 miles\r\nin diameter, situated on the border of the Mare; and, extending in a line\r\nfrom this towards Vieta are two others (_a_, and Cavendish _d_,),\r\nsomewhat larger, but otherwise similar; the more easterly being connected\r\nwith Cavendish by a mountain arm. One of the principal clefts of the\r\nsystem (all of which run roughly parallel to the N.E. side of the Mare,\r\nand extend to the Percy Mountains E. of Gassendi) crosses the floor of\r\n_d_, and, I believe, partially cuts into its W. wall. Another, the\r\ncoarsest, abuts on a mountain arm connecting _d_ with Mersenius, and,\r\nreappearing on the E. side, runs up to the N.W. wall of the other ring-\r\nplain, _a_, and, again reappearing on the E. of this, strikes across the\r\nrugged ground between _a_ and Cavendish _d_, traversing its floor and\r\nborder, as does also another cleft to the N. of it. Cavendish _d_\r\nincludes a coarse cleft on its floor, running from N. to S., which I have\r\nfrequently glimpsed with a 4 inch achromatic. There are two other\r\ndelicate clefts running from the Gassendi region to the S.W. side of\r\nMersenius, which are in part crater-rills.\r\n\r\nCAVENDISH.--A notable ring-plain, 32 miles in diameter, S.E. of\r\nMersenius, with a prominently terraced border, rising at one point on the\r\nS. to a height of 6000 feet above the interior, on which are a few low\r\nridges. A large bright ring-plain (_e_), about 12 miles in diameter,\r\nbreaks the continuity of the S.E. wall, and adjoining this, but beyond\r\nthe limits of the formation, is another smaller ring with a central hill.\r\nThere is also a bright crater on the N.W. border. The W. _glacis_ is very\r\nbroad, and includes two large shallow depressions. An especially fine\r\nvalley runs up to the N. wall, to the W. side of _e_.\r\n\r\nVIETA.--One of the finest objects in the third quadrant; a ring-plain 51\r\nmiles in diameter, with broad lofty walls, a peak on the west rising to\r\nnearly 11,000 feet, and another N. of it to considerably more than 14,000\r\nfeet above the interior. It is bounded by a linear border, approximating\r\nvery closely to an hexagonal shape, which is broken by many gaps and\r\ncross-valleys. On the S., the S.W. and S.E. sections of the wall do not\r\nmeet, being separated by a wide valley flanked on the W. by a fine\r\ncrater, which has broken down the rampart at this place. The N. border is\r\nlikewise intersected by valleys and by a crater-row. The inner slopes are\r\nconspicuously terraced. There is a very inconspicuous central mountain\r\nand several large craters on the floor, some of them double. Ten have\r\nbeen counted on the N. half of the interior. On the S.E. of Vieta are two\r\nfine overlapping ring-plains, with a crater on the wall common to both.\r\n\r\nDE VICO.--A conspicuous little ring-plain, about 9 miles in diameter,\r\nwith a lofty border, some distance E. of Mersenius.\r\n\r\nLEE.--An incomplete walled-plain, about 28 miles in diameter, on the S.\r\nside of the Mare Humorum, E. of Vitello, from which it is separated by\r\nanother partial enclosure, with a striking valley, not shown in the\r\npublished maps, running round its W. side. If viewed when its E. wall is\r\non the morning terminator, some isolated relics of the wrecked N.W. wall\r\nof Lee are prominent, in the shape of a number of attenuated bright\r\nelevations separated by gaps. Within are three or four conspicuous hills.\r\n\r\nDOPPELMAYER.--Under a high sun this large ring-plain, 40 miles in\r\ndiameter, resembles a great bay open to the N.W., without a trace of\r\ndetail to break the monotony of the surface on the side facing the Mare\r\nHumorum. When, however, it is viewed under oblique morning illumination,\r\na low broad ridge is easily traceable, extending across the opening,\r\nindicating the site of a ruined wall. There is an isolated mountain at\r\nthe S.W. end of this, which casts a fine spire of shadow across the floor\r\nat sunrise. The interior contains a massive bright central mountain and\r\nseveral little hills. The crest of the wall on the E. is much broken.\r\n\r\nFOURIER.--A large ring-plain, 30 miles in diameter, S.W. of Vieta, with a\r\nborder rising at a peak on the W. more than 9000 feet above the floor,\r\nThere are two craters on the outer slope of the N.W. wall, a prominent\r\ncrater on the S. wall, and (according to Schmidt) a small central crater\r\non the floor, which I have not seen. In the region between Fourier and\r\nVieta there are three ring-plains, two (the more westerly) standing side\r\nby side, and on the W., towards the Mare, are two others much larger,\r\nthat nearer to Fourier being traversed by one cleft, and the other by two\r\nclefts, crossing near the centre of the floor.\r\n\r\nCLAUSIUS.--A small bright ring-plain in an isolated position N.W. of\r\nSchickard, with a crater both on its N. and S. rim, and a faint central\r\nhill.\r\n\r\nLACROIX.--A ring-plain 20 miles in diameter, N. of Schickard. It has a\r\nprominent central mountain.\r\n\r\nSCHICKARD.--One of the largest wall-surrounded plains on the visible\r\nsurface of the moon, extending about 134 miles from N. to S., and about\r\nthe same from E. to W., enclosing a nearly level area, abounding in\r\ndetail. Its border, to a great extent linear, is very irregular, and much\r\nbroken by the interposition of small ring-plains and craters, and on the\r\nN. by cross-valleys. Its general height is about 4000 feet, the loftiest\r\npeak on the W. wall rising to more than 9000 feet above the floor. The\r\ninner slopes of this vast rampart are very complex, especially on the E.,\r\nwhere many terraces and depressions may be seen under suitable\r\nillumination. There are three large ring-plains in the interior, all of\r\nthem S. of the centre; and at least five smaller ones near the inner foot\r\nof the E. wall, which can only be well observed when libration is\r\nfavourable. The two more easterly of the large ring-plains are connected\r\nby a cleft, and there are several short clefts and crater-rows associated\r\nwith the smaller ring-plains. On the N. side of the area is a number of\r\nminute craters. The floor is diversified by two large dark markings--an\r\noblong patch on the S.W. side, abutting on the wall, being the more\r\nremarkable; and a dusky area, occupying a great portion of the N. part of\r\nthe floor, and extending up to the N. border. This is traversed by a\r\nlight streak running from N. to S., which is the site of a row of minute\r\ncraters.\r\n\r\nLEHMANN.--A ring-plain, about 28 miles in length, on the N. of Schickard,\r\nwith which it is connected by a number of cross-valleys.\r\n\r\nDREBBEL.--A bright ring-plain, 18 miles in diameter, on the N.W. of\r\nSchickard, with a lofty irregular border (especially on the W.),\r\nexhibiting a well-marked terrace on the E., a distinct gap on the N., and\r\na small crater on the S.E. rim. On a dusky area between it and Schickard\r\nstand three prominent deep craters.\r\n\r\nPHOCYLIDES.--This extraordinary walled plain, with its neighbouring\r\nenclosures, is structurally very remarkable and suggestive. It consists\r\nof a large irregular formation, with a lofty wall, flanked on the N. by a\r\nsmaller and still more irregular enclosure (_b_), the floor of which is\r\n1500 feet above that of Phocylides, the line of partition being a high\r\ncliff, probably representing a \"fault,\" whose shadow under a low sun is\r\nvery striking. Phocylides is about 80 miles in maximum length, or, if we\r\nreckon the small enclosure _b_ to form a part of it, more than 120 miles.\r\nThe loftiest peak, nearly 9000 feet, is on the W. border, near the\r\npartition wall. The continuity of the rampart is broken on the S. by a\r\nlarge crater. There is a bright ring-plain on the W. side of the floor,\r\nand a few small craters. Phocylides _b_ has only a solitary crater within\r\nit. Phocylides C, abutting on the W. flank of Phocylides, is about 26\r\nmiles in diameter. Its somewhat dusky interior is devoid of detail, but\r\nthe outer slope of its W. wall is crowded with a number of minute\r\ncraters, which, under good conditions, may be utilised as tests of the\r\ndefining power of the telescope used. Phocylides A, on the bright S.W.\r\nplain, is a large deep crater with a fine crater-row flanking it on the\r\nW.\r\n\r\nWARGENTIN.--A most remarkable member of the Phocylides group, flanking\r\nthe S.E. side of Schickard. Unlike the majority of lunar formations, its\r\nfloor is raised considerably above the surrounding region, so that it\r\nresembles a shallow oval dish turned upside down. It is 54 miles in\r\ndiameter, and, except on the S.W. (where it abuts on Phocylides _b_, and\r\nfor some distance is bounded by its wall), it has only a border of very\r\nmoderate dimensions. On the N.E. slope of this ghostly rampart I have\r\nseen a distinct little crater, and two much larger depressions on the\r\nN.W. slope. There are some low ridges on the floor, radiating from a\r\nnearly central point, which have been aptly compared to a bird's foot.\r\n\r\nSEGNER.--A fine ring-plain, 46 miles in diameter, on the S.E. side of\r\nSchiller, with a linear border on every side except the N. At a peak on\r\nthe W., whose shadow is very remarkable, it rises to a height of more\r\nthan 8000 feet above the outer surface. There is a crater on the S.W.\r\nwall, another on the N.W. wall, and several depressions on the outer\r\nslope on this side. The central mountain is small but conspicuous. A\r\nlarge unnamed enclosure extends N. of Segner: it is larger than Schiller,\r\nand is surrounded by a lofty barrier. The bright plain between this and\r\nthe latter is worth examination under a low sun.\r\n\r\nZUCHIUS.--Is situated on the S.E. of Segner, which it slightly overlaps.\r\nIt is very similar in size and general character, and has a lofty\r\nterraced wall, rising at one place on the W. to nearly 11,000 feet above\r\nthe floor. A very fine chain of craters, well seen when the opposite\r\nborder is on the morning terminator, runs round the outer W. slope of the\r\nwall. There is a bright crater beyond this on the S.W. Zuchius has a\r\ncentral peak.\r\n\r\nBETTINUS.--Another ring-plain of the same type and size, some distance S.\r\nof the last, with a massive border, terraced within, and rising on the W.\r\nmore than 13,000 feet above the floor, on which stands a grand central\r\nmountain, whose brilliant summit is in sunlight a long time before a ray\r\nreaches any part of the deep interior.\r\n\r\nKIRCHER.--A ring-plain, about 45 miles in diameter, S. of Bettinus,\r\nremarkable also for its very lofty rampart, which on the S. attains the\r\ntremendous height of nearly 18,000 feet above the floor, which appears to\r\nbe devoid of detail.\r\n\r\nWILSON.--The most southerly of the chain of five massive ring-plains,\r\nextending in an almost unbroken line from Segner and differing only very\r\nslightly in size. It is about 40 miles in diameter, and has a somewhat\r\nirregular border, both as regards shape and height, rising at one peak on\r\nthe S.W. to nearly 14,000 feet above a level interior, which apparently\r\ncontains no conspicuous features.\r\n\r\n\r\nEAST LONGITUDE 60 deg. TO 90  deg.\r\n\r\n\r\nGRIMALDI.--This ranks among the largest wall-surrounded plains on the\r\nmoon, and is perhaps the darkest. It extends 148 miles from N. to S. and\r\n129 miles from E. to W., enclosing an area of some 14,000 square miles,\r\nor nearly double that of the principality of Wales. This vast dusky\r\nsurface is bounded on the E. by a tolerably regular border, having an\r\naverage height of about 4000 feet, while on the opposite side it is much\r\nbroken, and in places considerably loftier, rising at one peak on the\r\nS.W. to an altitude of 9000 feet. About midway, also, this western\r\nrampart attains a great height, as may be seen by any one who observes at\r\nsunrise the magnificent shadow of it, and its many peaks thrown across\r\nthe bluish-grey interior. On the S. the wall is broken by a large\r\nirregular depression, on the W. of which is a very curious V-shaped rill\r\nvalley. On the N.W. it is comparatively low, and in places discontinuous;\r\nand even to a greater extent than on the S.W., intersected by passes. At\r\nthe extreme N. end, a number of wide valleys cut through the wall and\r\ntrend towards Lohrmann. There is a considerable ring-plain at the inner\r\nfoot of the N.E. wall, but, except this and a few longitudinal ridges,\r\njust visible under a very low sun, there is apparently no other object to\r\nvary the monotony of this great expanse.\r\n\r\nDAMOISEAU.--Consists of a complex arrangement of rings, an enclosure 23\r\nmiles in diameter, with a somewhat smaller enclosure placed excentrically\r\nwithin it (the N. side of both abutting on a bright plateau), with two\r\nlarge depressions intervening between their W. borders. This peculiarity,\r\nalmost unique, renders the formation an especially interesting object.\r\nDamoiseau is situated on the W. side of Grimaldi, on the E. coast-line of\r\nthe Oceanus Procellarum, from which the S.W. border rises at a gentle\r\ninclination. On the N.W. there is a curious curved inflexion of the Mare,\r\nbounded by a bright cliff, representing probably the E. side of a\r\ndestroyed ring, a supposition which is strengthened by the existence of a\r\nfaint scar on the surface of the sea, extending in a curve from one\r\nextremity of the bay to the other, and thus indicating the position of\r\nthe remainder of the ring. A conspicuous little crater stands at the S.\r\nend of it, and two others some distance to the W. The smaller component\r\nof Damoiseau contains a low central ridge.\r\n\r\nRICCIOLI.--An immense enclosure, near the limb, N.E. of Grimaldi, bounded\r\nby a rampart which is very irregular both in form and height, though\r\nnowhere of great altitude, and much broken by narrow gaps. It is\r\nespecially low and attenuated on the N., where a number of ridges with\r\nintervening valleys traverse it. On the S. also a wide valley cuts\r\nthrough it. With the exception of a few low rounded hills and ridges, a\r\nshort crater-row under the S.E. wall, and two small craters on the S.W.,\r\nthere are no details on the floor, which, however, is otherwise\r\nremarkable for the dusky tone of its surface, especially on the N. This\r\ndark patch occupies the whole of the N.E. side of the interior, and is\r\nbounded on the S. by an irregular outline, extending at one point nearly\r\nto the centre, and on the W. by a curved edge. The W. side is much darker\r\nthan the rest. It is, in fact, as dark, if not darker, than any part of\r\nthe floor of Grimaldi. Riccioli extends 106 miles from N. to S., and is\r\nnearly as broad. It includes an area of 9000 square miles.\r\n\r\nROCCA.--An irregular formation, 60 miles in length, near the limb S.E. of\r\nGrimaldi, consisting of a depression partially enclosed by mountain arms.\r\n\r\nSIRSALIS.--The more westerly of a conspicuous pair of ring-plains about\r\n20 miles in diameter, in the disturbed mountain region some distance S.W.\r\nof Grimaldi. It has lofty bright walls, rising to a great height above a\r\ndepressed floor, on which there is a prominent central mountain. The E.\r\nborder encroaches considerably on the somewhat larger companion, which\r\nis, however, scarcely a third so deep. One of the longest clefts on the\r\nvisible surface runs immediately W. of this formation. Commencing at a\r\nminute crater on the N. of it, it grazes the foot of the W. _glacis_;\r\nthen, passing a pair of small overlapping craters (resembling Sirsalis\r\nand its companion in miniature), it runs through a very rugged country to\r\na ring-plain E. of De Vico (De Vico _a_), which it traverses, and, still\r\nfollowing a southerly course, extends towards Byrgius, in the\r\nneighbourhood of which it is apparently lost at a ridge, though Schmidt\r\nand Gaudibert have traced it still farther in the same direction. It is\r\nat least 300 miles in length, and varies much in width and character,\r\nconsisting in places of distinct crater-rows.\r\n\r\nCRUGER.--A regular ring-plain E. of Fontana, 30 miles in diameter, with a\r\ndark floor, without detail, and comparatively low bright walls. There is\r\na smaller but very conspicuous ring-plain (Cruger _a_) on the W. of it,\r\nto which runs a branch of the great Sirsalis cleft.\r\n\r\nEICHSTADT.--A ring-plain, 32 miles in diameter, near the E. limb, S. of\r\nRocca. It is the largest and most southerly of three nearly circular\r\nenclosures, without central mountains or any other details of interest.\r\nOn the W. lies a great walled-plain with a very irregular border,\r\ncontaining several ring-plains and craters, and a crater-rill. Schmidt\r\nhas named this formation DARWIN.\r\n\r\nBYRGIUS.--A very irregular enclosure, about 40 miles in diameter, between\r\nCavendish and the E. limb, with a lofty and discontinuous border, rising\r\nat one point on the E. to a height of 7000 feet above the floor. There\r\nare wide openings both in the N. and S. wall, and some ridges within. The\r\nborder is broken on the E. by a crater, and on the W. by the well-known\r\ncrater Byrgius A, from which a number of bright streaks radiate, mostly\r\ntowards the E. One on the W. extends to Cavendish, and another to\r\nMersenius, traversing the ring-plain Cavendish C. North-east of Byrgius\r\nthere is a mountain arm which includes a peak 13,000 feet in height.\r\n\r\nPIAZZI.--A walled-plain, about 90 miles in length, some distance S.E. of\r\nVieta, with a complex broken border, including several depressions on the\r\nN.W., rising to about 7000 feet above a rather dark interior, on which\r\nthere is a prominent central mountain.\r\n\r\nLAGRANGE.--A larger but similar formation, 100 miles in diameter,\r\nassociated with the last on the N.E., with a complex terraced border,\r\nincluding peaks of 9000 feet, a bright crater on the W., and a ring-plain\r\non the N.W. The inner slope of the E. wall is a fine object at sunrise,\r\nwhen libration is favourable. The floor is dark and devoid of detail.\r\n\r\nBOUVARD.--A great irregular enclosure, which appears to be still larger\r\nthan Lagrange, S.E. of Piazzi, and close to the limb. It is bounded by a\r\nvery lofty rampart, rising at a peak on the W. to 10,000 feet. It has a\r\nfine central mountain.\r\n\r\nINGHIRAMI.--A very remarkable ring-plain, 60 miles in diameter, E. of\r\nSchickard, with a bright, broad, and nearly continuous border, terraced\r\nwithin, and intersected on the N.E. by narrow valleys, one of which is\r\nprolonged over the floor and extends to the central mountain. There are\r\ntwo curious dark spots on the N. side of the interior. Beyond the foot of\r\nthe _glacis_ on the S. a distinct cleft runs from a dusky spot to a group\r\nof small craters E. of Wargentin. There is a fine regular ring-plain with\r\na small central mount W. of Inghirami.\r\n\r\nPINGRE.--A ring-plain, about 18 miles in diameter, between Phocylides and\r\nthe limb.\r\n\r\nHAUSEN.--A ring-plain, close to the limb, N. of Bailly, which, but for\r\nits position, would be a fine object. It is, however, never sufficiently\r\nwell placed for observation.\r\n\r\nBAILLY.--One of the largest wall-surrounded plains on the moon, almost a\r\n\"sea\" in miniature, extending 150 miles from N. to S., and fully as much\r\nfrom W. to E. When caught at a favourable phase, it is, despite its\r\nposition, especially worthy of scrutiny. The rampart on the W., of the\r\nlinear type, is broken by several bright craters. On the S.W. two\r\nconsiderable overlapping ring-plains interfere with its continuity. On\r\nthe S.E. several very remarkable parallel curved valleys traverse the\r\nborder. The E. wall, which at one point attains a height of nearly 15,000\r\nfeet, is beautifully terraced. The floor on the eastern side includes\r\nseveral ring-plains (some of which are of a very abnormal type), many\r\nridges, and two delicate dark lines, crossing each other near the S. end,\r\nprobably representing clefts.\r\n\r\nLEGENTIL.--A large walled-plain, close to the limb, S. of Bailly.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOURTH QUADRANT\r\n\r\n\r\nWEST LONGITUDE 90 deg. TO 60 deg.\r\n\r\n\r\nKASTNER.--A large walled-plain at the S. end of the Mare Smythii, too\r\nnear the limb for satisfactory observation.\r\n\r\nMACLAURIN.--The principal member of a group of irregular ring-plains on\r\nthe W. side of the Mare Foecunditatis, a little S. of the lunar equator.\r\nSchmidt shows no details within it, except a small crater on the E. side\r\nof the floor.\r\n\r\nWEBB.--A ring-plain E. of Maclaurin, about 14 miles in diameter, with a\r\ndusky floor, enclosed by a bright rim, on the N.E. side of which there is\r\na small crater. Schmidt seems to have overlooked the central hill.\r\n\r\nLANGRENUS.--This noble circumvallation, the most northerly of the\r\nmeridional chain of immense walled-plains, extending for more than 600\r\nmiles from near the equator to S. lat. 40 deg., would, but for its\r\npropinquity to the limb, rank with Copernicus (which in many respects it\r\nresembles) among the most striking objects on the surface of the moon.\r\nIts length is about 90 miles from N. to S., and its breadth fully as\r\nmuch. In shape it approximates very closely to that of a foreshortened\r\nregular hexagon. The walls, which at one point on the E. rise to an\r\naltitude of nearly 10,000 feet, are continuous, except on this side,\r\nwhere they are broken by the interference of an irregular depression, and\r\non the extreme S., where they are intersected by cross-valleys. Within,\r\nthe terraces are remarkably distinct, and the intervening valleys\r\nstrongly marked. The brilliant compound central mountain rises at its\r\nloftiest peak to a height of more than 3000 feet. On the N. of it is an\r\nobscure circular ring, which may possibly merely represent a fortuitous\r\ncombination of ridges, though it has all the appearance of a modified\r\nring-plain. On the Mare, some distance N.E. of the formation, is a group\r\nof three ring-plains, with two small craters (associated with a ridge) on\r\nthe N. of them. Two of the more westerly of these objects have prominent\r\ncentral mountains, and the third a very dark interior. At least three\r\nbright streaks originate on the E. flank of Langrenus, which, diverging\r\nwidely, traverse the Mare Foecunditatis.\r\n\r\n[FLATTENINGS ON THE MOON'S WESTERN LIMB.--About thirty years ago, the\r\nRev. Henry Cooper Key drew attention to certain flattenings which he had\r\nnoted on the W. limb, which are very apparent under favourable conditions\r\nof libration. Their position cannot be closely defined, but the principal\r\ndeviation from circularity extends from about S. lat. 10 deg. to the\r\nregion on the limb opposite the S. border of the Mare Crisium.]\r\n\r\nVENDELINUS.--The second great enclosure pertaining to the meridional\r\nchain--a magnificent walled-plain of about the same dimensions as the\r\nlast. It is bounded by a very irregular rampart, which, under evening\r\nillumination, is especially noteworthy, though nowhere approaching the\r\naltitude of that of Langrenus. Its continuity on the W. is broken by the\r\ngreat ring-plain Vendelinus C, about 50 miles in diameter, a formation\r\nresembling Langrenus in miniature. This is hexagonal in shape, and has\r\nmany rings and depressions on its W. wall. South of Vendelinus C, the\r\nwall of Vendelinus runs up in a bold curve to the fine terraced ring-\r\nplain Vendelinus B, and is surmounted by a bright serpentine crest, and\r\ntraversed by several valleys running down the slope to the floor. B has a\r\nsmall crater on its N. wall, and another in the interior. There is a wide\r\ngap in the S. border of Vendelinus, which is partially occupied by\r\nanother somewhat smaller ring-plain, bounded by a southerly extension of\r\nthe E. wall, which includes on its outer slope many craters and other\r\ndepressions, and abuts near its N. end on the large ring-plain Vendelinus\r\nA, which has a prominently terraced wall and a large bright central\r\nmountain. Between A and C extends a plateau that may be regarded as the\r\nN. limit of the formation, including, among other minor details, a fine\r\ncleft, which traverses it from N. to S., and ultimately extends to a\r\ngroup of craters on the floor. On the S. side of the interior is one\r\nlarge ring-plain, flanked on the W. by two small craters. Near the N. end\r\nare many bright little craters, many of them unrecorded. Vendelinus C is\r\nbordered on the E. by two large semicircular formations with low walls\r\nextending on to the floor. Mr. W.H. Maw and others have detected many\r\nminute depressions in connection with these curious objects; and N. of\r\nthem, on the outer slope of C, where it runs out to the level of the\r\nplateau, I have seen the surface at sunset riddled like a sieve with\r\ncraterlets and little pits. There is an irregular ring-plain N. of A,\r\nwith linear walls, and another, much smaller and brighter, on the N. of\r\nthis, standing a little beyond the N. limits of Langrenus.\r\n\r\nLA PEYROUSE.--A much foreshortened walled-plain, 41 miles in diameter,\r\nclose to the limb, S.W. of Langrenus. There is a longitudinal ridge on\r\nthe floor. Between it and Langrenus are two large ring-plains with\r\ncentral mountains, and on the N.E., La Peyrouse A, a bright crater,\r\nadjoining which is La Peyrouse DELTA, one of the most brilliant spots on\r\nthe moon.\r\n\r\nANSGARIUS.--A ring-plain, 50 miles in diameter, still nearer to the limb\r\nthan the last.\r\n\r\nBEHAIM.--A great ring-plain, 65 miles in diameter, S. of Ansgarius, and\r\nconnected with it by ridges. It has lofty walls and a central mountain.\r\n\r\nHECATAEUS.--An immense walled-plain, 115 miles in length, on the S.W. of\r\nVendelinus, with a very irregular rampart and a conspicuous central\r\nmountain. It is flanked E. and W. by other large enclosures, which can\r\nonly be seen to advantage when libration is favourable.\r\n\r\nW. HUMBOLDT.--Though close to the limb, this enormous wall-surrounded\r\nplain, some 130 miles in extreme length, and estimated to have an area of\r\n12,000 square miles, is well worth observing under suitable conditions.\r\nIt ranks among the largest formations of its class, and in many respects\r\nresembles Bailly on the S.E. limb. At one point on the E. a peak rises to\r\n16,000 feet, and on the opposite side there are peaks nearly as high. The\r\nfloor contains some detail--a crater, nearly central, associated with\r\nridges, and two dark spots, one at the S. and the other at the N. end.\r\n\r\nPHILLIPS.--Abuts on the E. side of W. Humboldt. It is a walled-plain,\r\nabout 80 miles in length, with a border much broken on the E., and\r\nterraced within on the opposite side. There are many hills and ridges on\r\nthe floor.\r\n\r\nLEGENDRE.--A fine ring-plain, 46 miles in diameter, on the S.E. of the\r\nlast. According to Schmidt, there is a crater on the S. side of the\r\nfloor. There is a small ring-plain, ADAMS, on the S.\r\n\r\nPETAVIUS.--The third member of the great meridional chain: a noble\r\nwalled-plain, with a complex rampart, extending nearly 100 miles from N.\r\nto S., which encloses a very rugged convex floor, traversed by many\r\nshallow valleys, and includes a massive central mountain and one of the\r\nmost remarkable clefts on the visible surface. To observe these features\r\nto the best advantage, the formation should be viewed when its W. wall is\r\non the evening terminator. At this phase a considerable portion of the\r\ninterior on the N. is obscured by the shadow of the rampart, but the\r\nprincipal features on the S. half of the floor, and on the broad gently-\r\nshelving slope of the W. wall, are seen better than under any other\r\nconditions. The border is loftiest on the E., where the ring-plain\r\nWrottesley abuts on it. It rises at this point to nearly 11,000 feet,\r\nwhile on the opposite side it nowhere greatly exceeds 6000 feet above the\r\ninterior. The terraces, however, on the W. are much more numerous, and,\r\nwith the associated valleys, render this section of the wall one of the\r\nmost striking objects of its class. The N. border is conspicuously broken\r\nby the many valleys from the region S. of Vendelinus, which run up to and\r\ntraverse it. On the S., also, it is intersected by gaps, and in one place\r\ninterrupted by a large crater. There is a remarkable bifurcation of the\r\nborder S. of Wrottesley. A lower section separates from the main rampart\r\nand, extending to a considerable distance S.E. of it, encloses a wide and\r\ncomparatively level area which is crossed by two short clefts. The\r\ncentral mountains of Petavius, rising at one peak to a height of nearly\r\n6000 feet above the floor, form a noble group, exceeding in height those\r\nin Gassendi by more than 2000 feet. The convexity of the interior is such\r\nthat the centre of it is about 800 feet higher than the margin, under the\r\nwalls; a protuberance which would, nevertheless, be scarcely remarked _in\r\nsitu_, as it represents no steeper gradient than about 1 in 300 on any\r\nportion of its superficies. The great cleft, extending from the central\r\nmountains to the S.E. wall, and perhaps beyond, was discovered by\r\nSchroter on September 16, 1788, and can be seen in a 2 inch achromatic.\r\nIn larger instruments it is found to be in places bordered by raised\r\nbanks.\r\n\r\nWROTTESLEY.--A formation, about 25 miles in diameter, closely associated\r\nwith the E. wall of Petavius, the shape of which it has clearly modified.\r\nIts border on the E., of the linear type, rises nearly 9000 feet above a\r\nlight interior, where there is a small bright central mountain and some\r\nmounds. There is a prominent valley running along the inner slope of the\r\nW. wall.\r\n\r\nPALITZSCH.--If this extraordinary formation is observed when the moon is\r\nabout three days old, it resembles a great trough, or deep elongated\r\ngorge flanking the W. wall of Petavius, though it is a true ring-plain,\r\nalbeit of a very abnormal type, about 60 miles in length and 20 miles in\r\nbreadth, with a somewhat dusky interior. On the outer slope of its W.\r\nwall is a bright ring-plain with a lofty border and a central mountain.\r\n\r\nHASE.--An irregular formation, about 50 miles in diameter, on the S.W. of\r\nPetavius, with which it is connected by extensions of the W. and E. walls\r\nof the latter. Its rampart, some 7000 feet above the floor, is broken by\r\ndepressions on the W.; and on the S. is bounded by a smaller ring-plain\r\nwith still loftier walls. Schmidt shows a large crater and three smaller\r\nones on the W. side of the floor.\r\n\r\nMARINUS.--A ring-plain on the N.E. side of the Mare Australe, between\r\nFurnerius and the limb.\r\n\r\nFURNERIUS.--The fourth and most southerly component of the great\r\nmeridional chain of walled-plains, commencing on the N. with Langrenus: a\r\nfine but irregular enclosure, about 80 miles in extreme length and much\r\nmore in breadth. Its rampart is very lofty, and tolerably continuous on\r\nthe N. and W., but on the other sides is interrupted by small craters and\r\ndepressions. At peaks on the E. it attains a height of more than 11,000\r\nfeet above the interior, and there are other peaks rising nearly as high.\r\nThere is a ring-plain (Furnerius B) with a central hill, on the E. side\r\nof the floor, and numerous craters and crater-pits in other parts of it.\r\nOn the N.W. side of B there is a short cleft, on the W., a well-marked\r\ncrater-row, and on the E. a long rill-valley. The very brilliant crater\r\n(Furnerius A) on the N.E. _glacis_ is the origin of two fine light\r\nstreaks, one extending S. for more than 100 miles, and the other in the\r\nopposite direction for a great distance.\r\n\r\nFRAUNHOFER.--A ring-plain, S. of Furnerius, about 30 miles in diameter,\r\nwith a regular border rising about 5000 feet above the floor. A smaller\r\nring-plain abuts on the N.E. side of it, which has slightly disturbed its\r\nwall.\r\n\r\nOKEN.--A large enclosure in S. lat. 43 deg. with broken irregular walls.\r\nIt is too near the limb for observation.\r\n\r\nVEGA.--Schmidt represents this peculiar formation, situated S.E. of Oken,\r\nas having a regular curved unbroken rampart on the E., while the opposite\r\nborder is occupied by four large partially overlapping ring-plains, two\r\nof which contain small craters. The floor is devoid of detail.\r\n\r\nPONTECOULANT.--A great irregular walled plain, about 100 miles in length,\r\nnear the S.W. limb, with a border rising in places to a height of 6000\r\nfeet above the floor.\r\n\r\nHANNO.--A smaller and more regular enclosure, adjoining Pontecoulant on\r\nthe N.W., and still nearer the limb.\r\n\r\n\r\nWEST LONGITUDE 60 deg. TO 40  deg.\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSIER.--The more westerly of a remarkable pair of bright craters, about\r\n9 miles in diameter, standing in an isolated position in the Mare\r\nFoecunditatis just S. of the Equator. Madler represents them as similar\r\nin every respect, but Webb, observing them in 1855 and 1856 with a 3 7/10\r\nachromatic, found them very distinctly different,--Messier, the more\r\nwesterly, being not only clearly smaller than its companion, but longer\r\nfrom W. to E. than from N. to S., as it undoubtedly is at the present\r\ntime. Messier A, however, as the companion is termed, though larger, is\r\ncertainly not circular, as sometimes shown, but triangular with curved\r\nsides. It is just possible that change may have occurred here, for Madler\r\ncarefully observed these objects more than three hundred times, and, it\r\nmay be presumed, under very different phases. Messier A is the origin of\r\ntwo slightly divergent light streaks, resembling a comet's tail, which\r\nextend over the Mare towards its E. border N. of Lubbock, and are crossed\r\nobliquely by a narrower streak. Messier and Messier A stand near the S.\r\nand narrowest end of a tapering curved light area. There is a number of\r\ncraterlets and minute pits in the neighbourhood, and under a high light\r\ntwo round dusky spots are traceable in connection with the \"comet\"\r\nmarking, one just beyond its northern, and the other beyond its southern\r\nborder, near its E. extremity.\r\n\r\nLUBBOCK.--A brilliant little crater, about 4 or 5 miles in diameter, near\r\nthe E. coast-line of the Mare Foecunditatis. The region E. of this object\r\nis particularly well worthy of scrutiny under a low sun, on account of\r\nthe variety of detail it includes. On the S.E. run three fine parallel\r\nclefts, originating near the N. end of the Pyrenees.\r\n\r\nGUTTEMBERG.--A very fine ring-plain of peculiar shape, about 45 miles in\r\nwidth, with a lofty wall, broken on the N.W. by another ring-plain some\r\n14 miles in diameter, and on the S.E. by a small but distinct crater. The\r\nborder presents a wide opening towards the S., which is traversed by a\r\nnumber of longitudinal valleys, both the E. and W. sections of the wall\r\nbeing prolonged in this direction. A fine crater-row runs round the outer\r\nslope of the E. wall, from the crater just mentioned to the N. side of\r\nthe formation. It is best seen when the W. wall is on the evening\r\nterminator. There is also a broad valley on the S. prolongation of the W.\r\nwall. The central mountain is bright but not large. A cleft crosses the\r\nN.W. side of the floor. North of Guttemberg there is a curious oblong\r\nformation with low walls, connected with the N.E. border by a ridge, and\r\nwith the N. border by a remarkable row of depressions, situated on a\r\nmound; and beyond this object on the E. are three parallel clefts running\r\ntowards the N.E. On the W. will be found some of the clefts belonging to\r\nthe Goclenius rill-system. In the rugged region S.E. of the formation is\r\na peculiar low ring with a very uneven floor and a large central hill.\r\nThe E. wall of Guttemberg may be regarded as forming a portion of the\r\nPyrenees Mountains.\r\n\r\nGOCLENIUS.--A ring-plain, about 28 miles in diameter, bearing much\r\nresemblance to Plinius in form and size, and, like this formation,\r\nassociated with a fine system of clefts. The lofty rampart, tolerably\r\ncontinuous on the W., is broken on the S.W. by a bright crater, and on\r\nthe N.W. by a remarkable triangular depression. It is also traversed by a\r\ndelicate valley extending from the crater on the S.W. to another on the\r\nN.W. border; and at a point a little W. of the first crater is dislocated\r\nby an intrusive mass of rock. There are several gaps on the E. and many\r\nspurs and irregularities in outline both within and without. A great\r\nportion of the N. wall is linear, and joins the E. section nearly at\r\nright angles. West of the triangular depression it appears to be\r\npartially wrecked, indications of the destruction being very evident if\r\nit be observed when the E. wall is near the morning terminator. The small\r\nbright central mountain is remarkable for its curious oblong shadow. Two\r\nclefts traverse the interior of Goclenius. (1) Originates at the S. wall,\r\nE. of the crater, and runs E. of the central mountain to the N. wall; (2)\r\ncrosses the _debris_ of the ruined N.W. border, runs parallel to the\r\nfirst, and extends nearly to the centre of the floor, (1) Re-appears at\r\nthe foot of a mound outside the N. wall, and, after crossing the outer W.\r\nslope of the great ring-plain on the N.W. wall of Guttemberg, runs to the\r\nW. side of an oblong formation N. of it. There are two other clefts,\r\nclosely parallel and W. of this, traversing the Mare, and terminating\r\namong the mountains on the N.W. These are crossed at right angles by what\r\nappears to be a \"fault,\" running in a N.W. direction from the W. side of\r\nGuttemberg.\r\n\r\nMACCLURE.--One of a curious group of formations situated in the Mare\r\nFoecunditatis some distance S.W. of Goclenius. It is a bright ring-plain,\r\nabout 15 miles in diameter, with a narrow gap in the N.E. wall and a\r\nsmall central hill. A prominent ridge runs up to the N. border; and on\r\nthe S.W. a rill-valley may be traced, extending S. to a bright deep\r\nlittle crater W. of Cook.\r\n\r\nCROZIER.--A conspicuous ring-plain a few miles N.N.W. of MacClure, and of\r\nabout the same size. It has a faint central hill. Neison refers to two\r\nlong straight streaks extending from Crozier towards Messier.\r\n\r\nBELLOT.--A brilliant little ring-plain N.E. of Crozier.\r\n\r\nCOOK.--A ring-plain, about 25 miles in diameter, on the E. side of the\r\nMare Foecunditatis in S. lat. 17 deg., with low and (except on the S.E.)\r\nvery narrow walls. There is a small circular depression on the S. border,\r\nand a prominent crater on the W. side of the dark interior. On the S.S.E.\r\nis the curiously shaped enclosure Cook _d_, with very bright broad lofty\r\nwalls and a fine central mountain. On the plain W. of Cook is a\r\nconspicuous crater-row, consisting of six or seven craters, diminishing\r\nin size in both directions from the centre.\r\n\r\nCOLOMBO.--A fine ring-plain, about 50 miles in diameter, situated in the\r\nhighlands separating the Mare Foecunditatis and the Mare Nectaris. The\r\nwall, rising at one place to a height of 8000 feet above the floor, is\r\nvery complicated and irregular, being traversed within by many terraces,\r\nand almost everywhere by cross-valleys. Its shape is greatly distorted by\r\nthe large ring-plain _a_, which abuts on its N.E. flank. It loses its\r\nindividuality altogether on the S., its place being occupied by two large\r\ndepressions, and lofty mountains trending towards the S.E. In the centre\r\nthere are several distinct bright elevations.\r\n\r\nMAGELHAENS.--The more northerly and the larger of a pair of ring-plains\r\nbetween Colombo and Goclenius, with a bright and somewhat irregular\r\nthough continuous border. The dark interior includes a small central\r\nmountain. Its companion on the S.W., Magelhaens _a_, slightly overlaps\r\nit. This also has a central hill, and a crater on the outer slope of its\r\nE. wall.\r\n\r\nSANTBECH.--A very prominent ring-plain, 46 miles in diameter, on the S.E.\r\nside of the Mare Foecunditatis, W. of Fracastorius. The continuity of its\r\nfine lofty rampart is broken on the W., where it rises nearly 10,000 feet\r\nabove the floor, by a brilliant little crater just below the crest, and\r\nby a narrow gap on the S. The wall on the E. towers to a height of 15,000\r\nfeet above the interior. On its broad outer slope, near the summit, there\r\nis a fine crater, and S. of this running obliquely down the slope a\r\ndistinct valley. On the N.E., where the _glacis_ runs down to the level\r\nof the surrounding plain, there is a large crateriform object with a\r\nbroken N. border, and a small crater opposite the opening. A long coarse\r\nvalley runs from this latter object in a N.E. direction to the region W.\r\nof Bohnenberger. Santbech contains a prominent central peak.\r\n\r\nBIOT.--A brilliant little ring-plain, scarcely more than 7 miles in\r\ndiameter, standing in an isolated position in the Mare Foecunditatis N.E.\r\nof Wrottesley. There is a number of bright streaks in its neighbourhood;\r\nand a few miles E. of it, in the hilly region W. of Santbech, another\r\nconspicuous crater of about the same size.\r\n\r\nBORDA.--A ring-plain about 25 miles in diameter, S.S.W. of Santbech, with\r\na rampart low on the N. and S., but elsewhere of considerable height, and\r\na very conspicuous central mountain. A wide deep valley flanked by lofty\r\nmountains extends from the N. wall for many miles towards the N.W. It is\r\nan especially noteworthy object when the W. wall of Santbech is on the\r\nevening terminator, as its somewhat winding course, indicated by the\r\nbright summit-ridges of the bordering mountains, can be followed some\r\nhours before either the interior of the valley or the region between it\r\nand Santbech are in sunlight. Among the mountains W. of Borda there is a\r\npeak more than 11,000 feet in height.\r\n\r\nSNELLIUS.--A very fine ring-plain, 50 miles in diameter, S.E. of\r\nPetavius, with terraced walls, considerably broken on the S.E. by\r\ncraters, &c. It rises on the E. nearly 7000 feet above a dark floor,\r\nwhich contains a central mountain. N.E. of Snellius is a smaller ring-\r\nplain (Snellius _a_), and due E. a curious rough plateau, bordered on the\r\nN. and S. by a number of small craters.\r\n\r\nSTEVINUS.--A somewhat larger ring-plain, S. of Snellius, with a border\r\nrising on the S. to more than 11,000 feet above a dark interior, which\r\nincludes a bright central mountain.\r\n\r\nREICHENBACH.--A very abnormally-shaped ring-plain, about 30 miles in\r\ndiameter, with a rampart nearly 12,000 feet high. The border is broken on\r\nthe W., S., and E. by craters and depressions, and on the N. is flanked\r\nby two overlapping ring-plains, _a_ and _b_. On the S.W. lies a\r\nmagnificent serpentine valley, fully 100 miles in length and about 12\r\nmiles in breadth at the N. end, but gradually diminishing as it runs\r\nsouthwards, till it reaches a depression N. of Rheita, where it\r\nterminates: here is scarcely more than 4 miles wide.\r\n\r\nRHEITA.--A formation, about 35 miles in diameter, S. of Reichenbach, with\r\nregular lofty walls, rising at a peak on the N.E. to a height of more\r\nthan 14,000 feet above the interior, on which there is a small but\r\nprominent central mountain, a smaller elevation W. of the centre, and two\r\nadjoining craters at the foot of the S. wall. On the E. originates\r\nanother fine valley, very similar to that already mentioned in connection\r\nwith Reichenbach. It runs in a S.S.W. direction, is about 100 miles in\r\nlength, and, in its widest part, is about 12 miles across. Like the\r\nReichenbach valley, it terminates at a small crater-like object, which\r\nhas a border broken down on the side facing the valley, and a small\r\ncentral hill. About midway between its extremities, this great gorge is\r\ncrossed by a wall of rock, like a narrow bridge.\r\n\r\nJANSSEN.--An immense irregular enclosure, reminding one of the very\r\nsimilar area, bordered by Walter, Lexell, Hell, &c., in the third\r\nquadrant. It extends about 150 miles from E. to W., and more than 100\r\nfrom N. to S., its limits on the N. being rather indefinite. Its very\r\nrugged humpy surface includes one great central mountain, and innumerable\r\nminor hills and ridges, craters, and crater-pits; but the principal\r\nfeature is the magnificent curved rill-valley running from the S. side of\r\nFabricius across the rough expanse to the S. side. This fine object, very\r\ncoarse on the N., passes the central mountain on the E. side, and becomes\r\ngradually narrower as it approaches the border; before reaching which,\r\nanother finer cleft branches from it on the W., and also runs to the S.\r\nside of the plain.\r\n\r\nLOCKYER.--A prominent deep ring-plain, 32 miles in diameter, with massive\r\nbright lofty walls, standing just outside the S.E. border of Janssen.\r\nSchmidt shows a minute crater on the S. rim. I have seen a crater within,\r\nat the inner foot of the W. wall, and a central peak.\r\n\r\nFABRICIUS.--A ring-plain, 55 miles in diameter, with a lofty terraced\r\nborder, rising on the S.W. to a height of nearly 10,000 feet above the\r\ninterior. It is partially included by the rampart of Janssen, and the\r\ngreat rill-valley on the floor of the latter appears to cut through its\r\nS. wall. There is a long central mountain on the floor, with a prominent\r\nridge extending along the E. side of it. W. of Fabricius (between it and\r\nthe border of Janssen) lies a very irregular enclosure, with three\r\ndistinct craters within it; and on the E., running from the wall to the\r\nE. side of Janssen, is a straight narrow valley. Both Fabricius and\r\nJanssen should be viewed under a low morning sun.\r\n\r\nSTEINHEIL.--A double ring-plain, W. of Janssen, 27 miles in diameter. The\r\nmore easterly formation sinks to a depth of nearly 12,000 feet below the\r\nsummit of the border.\r\n\r\nMETIUS.--This ring-plain, of about the same size as Fabricius, but with a\r\nstill loftier barrier, abuts on the N. wall of this formation, and has\r\ncaused a very obvious deformation in its contour. It is prominently\r\nterraced internally, and on the W. the wall rises at one peak to a height\r\nof 13,000 feet above the floor, which contains a deep crater on the W. of\r\nthe centre, and many ridges.\r\n\r\nBIELA.--A considerable ring-plain, about 55 miles in diameter, S.W. of\r\nJanssen, with a wall broken on the N.W., S., and E. by rings and large\r\nenclosures. There is a central mountain, but apparently no other details\r\non the floor.\r\n\r\nROSENBERGER.--This formation, about 50 miles in diameter, is one of the\r\nremarkable group of large rings to which Vlacq, Hommel, Pitiscus, &c.,\r\nbelong. Its walls, though of only moderate altitude, are distinctly\r\nterraced. In addition to a prominent central mountain (E. of which\r\nSchmidt shows two craters), there is a large crater on the S. side of the\r\nfloor, and many smaller craters and crater-pits.\r\n\r\nHAGECIUS.--The most westerly member of the Vlacq group of formations. It\r\nis situated on the S.W. of Rosenberger, and is about 50 miles in\r\ndiameter. The rampart on the E. is continuous and of the normal type, but\r\non the opposite side is broken by a number of smaller rings.\r\n\r\n\r\nWEST LONGITUDE 40 deg. TO 20  deg.\r\n\r\n\r\nCENSORINUS.--A brilliant little crater, with very bright surroundings, in\r\nthe Mare Tranquilitatis, nearly on the moon's equator, in W. long. 32\r\ndeg. 22 min. Another smaller but less conspicuous crater adjoins it on\r\nthe W. On the Mare to the S. extends a delicate cleft which trends\r\ntowards the Sabine and Ritter rill system.\r\n\r\nCAPELLA.--Forms with Isodorus, its companion on the E. (which it\r\npartially overlaps), a very noteworthy object. It is about 30 miles in\r\ndiameter, with finely terraced walls, broken on the S.W. by broad\r\nintrusive rill-valleys. The rampart on the N.E. is also cut through by a\r\nmagnificent valley, which extends for many miles beyond the limits of the\r\nformation. There is a fine central mountain, on which M. Gaudibert\r\ndiscovered a crater, the existence of which has been subsequently\r\nverified by Professor Weinek on a Lick observatory negative.\r\n\r\nISODORUS.--The rampart of this fine ring-plain, which is of about the\r\nsame size as Capella, rises at a peak on the W. to a height of more than\r\n13,000 feet above the interior, which, except a small bright crater at\r\nthe foot of the E. wall and a smaller one adjoining it on the N.,\r\ncontains no detail. The region between Isodorus and the equator includes\r\nmany interesting objects, among them Isodorus _b_, an irregular formation\r\nopen towards the N., and containing several craters.\r\n\r\nBOHNENBERGER.--A ring-plain about 22 miles in diameter, situated on the\r\nW. side of the Mare Nectaris, under the precipitous flanks of the\r\nPyrenees, whose prominent shadows partially conceal it for many hours\r\nafter sunrise. The circular border is comparatively low, and, except on\r\nthe N., continuous. Here there is a gap, and on the W. of it an intrusive\r\nmass of rock. From its very peculiar shadow at sunrise, the wall on the\r\nE. appears to be very irregular. The club-shaped central mountain is of\r\nconsiderable size, but not conspicuous. S. of Bohnenberger stands the\r\nvery attenuated ring, Bohnenberger A. It is of about the same diameter,\r\nhas a large deep crater on its N. rim, and a smaller one, distinguished\r\nwith difficulty, on its S.E. rim. On the N. of Bohnenberger there is a\r\nbright little ring-plain connected with the formation by a lofty ridge,\r\nunder the E. flank of which Schmidt shows a crater-chain. An especially\r\nfine cleft originates on the E. side of this crater, which, following an\r\nundulating course over the Mare Nectaris, terminates at Rosse, N. of\r\nFracastorius.\r\n\r\nTORRICELLI.--A remarkable little formation in the Mare Tranquilitatis, N.\r\nof Theophilus, consisting of two unequal contiguous craters ranging from\r\nW. to E., whose partition wall has nearly disappeared, so that, under a\r\nlow sun, when the interior of both is filled with shadow, the pair\r\nresemble the head of a javelin. The larger, western, ring is about 10\r\nmiles in diameter, and the other about half this size. There is a gap in\r\nthe W. wall of the first, and a long spur projecting from its S. side;\r\nand a minute crater on the S. border of the smaller object. Torricelli is\r\npartially enclosed on the S. by a circular arrangement of ridges. There\r\nis a delicate cleft running in a meridional direction on the Mare, E. of\r\nthe formation, and another on the N., running from W. to E.\r\n\r\nHYPATIA.--A ring-plain, about 30 miles in extreme length, of very\r\nabnormal shape, on the E. side of the Mare, N.N.E. of Theophilus, with a\r\nwall rising at a peak on the E. to a height of more than 7000 feet above\r\na dusky floor, which does not apparently contain any detail. A small\r\ncrater breaks the uniformity of the border on the W. Beyond the wall on\r\nthe S.E. lies the fine bright crater Hypatia A, with another less\r\nprominent adjoining it on the S.W.\r\n\r\nTHEOPHILUS.--The most northerly of three of the noblest ring-mountains on\r\nthe visible surface of the moon, situated on the N.E. side of the Mare\r\nNectaris. It is nearly 64 miles in diameter, and is enclosed by a mighty\r\nrampart towering above the floor at one peak on the W. to the height of\r\n18,000 feet, and at two other peaks on the opposite side to nearly 16,000\r\nand 14,000. The border, though appearing nearly circular with low powers,\r\nis seen, under greater magnification, to be made up of several more or\r\nless linear sections, which give it a polygonal outline. It is\r\nprominently terraced within, the loftier terraces on the W. rising nearly\r\nto the height of the crest of the wall, and including several craters and\r\nelongated depressions. On the W. _glacis_ is a row of large inosculating\r\ncraters; and near its foot, S.E. of Madler, a short unrecorded rill-\r\nvalley. The magnificent bright central mountain is composed of many\r\ndistinct masses surmounted by lofty peaks, one of which is about 6000\r\nfeet above the floor, and covers an area of at least 300 square miles.\r\nExcept a distinct crater on the S.W. quarter, this appears to be the only\r\nobject within the ring.\r\n\r\nCYRILLUS.--The massive border of Theophilus partially overlaps the N.W.\r\nside of this great walled-plain, which is even more complex than that of\r\nits neighbour, and far more irregular in form, exhibiting many linear\r\nsections. Its crest on the S.E. is clearly inflected towards the\r\ninterior, a peculiarity that has already been noticed in connection with\r\nCopernicus and some other objects. On the inner slope of this wall there\r\nis a large bright crater, in connection with which have been detected two\r\ndelicate rills extending to the summit. I have not seen these, but one of\r\nthe crater-rows shown by Schmidt, between this crater and the crest, has\r\noften been noted. The N.E. wall is very remarkable. It appears to be\r\npartially wrecked. If observed at an early stage of sunrise, a great\r\nnumber of undulating ridges and rows of hillocks will be seen crossing\r\nthe region E. of Theophilus. They resemble a consolidated stream of\r\n\"ropy\" lava which has flowed through and over the wall and down the\r\n_glacis_. The arrangement of the ridges within Cyrillus is very\r\nnoteworthy, as is also the triple mountain near the centre of the floor.\r\nThe fine curved cleft thereon traverses the W. side, sweeping round the\r\ncentral mountains, and then turning to the south. I have only\r\noccasionally seen it in its entirety. There are also two oblong dark\r\npatches on the S. side of the interior. The S. wall of Cyrillus is broken\r\nby a narrow pass opening out into a valley situated on the plateau which\r\nbounds the W. side of the oblong formation lying between it and\r\nCatherina, and overlooking a curious shallow square-shaped enclosure\r\nabutting on the S.W. side of Cyrillus.\r\n\r\nCATHERINA.--The largest of the three great formations: a ring-plain with\r\na very irregular outline, extending more than 70 miles in a meridional\r\ndirection, and of still greater width. The wall is comparatively narrow\r\nand low on the N.E. (8000 feet above the floor), but on the N.W. it rises\r\nto more than double this height, and is broken by some large depressions.\r\nThe inner slope on the S.E. is very gentle, and includes two bright\r\ncraters, but exhibits only slight indications of terraces. The most\r\nremarkable features on an otherwise even interior are the large low\r\nnarrow ring (with a crater within it), occupying fully a third of the\r\narea of the floor, and a large ring-plain on the S. side.\r\n\r\nMADLER.--The interest attaching to this formation is not to be measured\r\nby its size, for it is only about 20 miles in diameter, but by the\r\nremarkable character of its surroundings. Its bright regular wall, rising\r\n6000 feet on the E. and only about half as much on the W., above a rather\r\ndark interior, is everywhere continuous, except at one place on the N.\r\nHere there is a narrow gap (flanked on the E. by a somewhat obscure\r\nlittle crater) through which a curious bent ridge coming up from the N.\r\npasses, and, extending on to the floor, expands into something resembling\r\na central mountain. Under a high sun Madler has a very peculiar\r\nappearance. The lofty E. wall is barely perceptible, while the much lower\r\nW. border is conspicuously brilliant; and the E. half of the floor is\r\ndark, while the remainder, with two objects representing the loftier\r\nportions of the intrusive ridge, is prominently white. Under an evening\r\nsun, with the terminator lying some distance to the W., a very remarkable\r\nobscure ring with a low border, a valley running round it on the W. side,\r\nand two large central mounds, may be easily traced. This object is\r\nconnected with Madler by what appears to be under a higher sun a bright\r\nelbow-shaped marking, in connection with which I have often suspected a\r\ndelicate cleft. Between the obtuse-angled bend of this object and the W.\r\nwall of Madler, two large circular dark spots may be seen under a high\r\nsun; and on the surface of the Mare N. of it, a great number of delicate\r\nwhite spots.\r\n\r\nBEAUMONT.--A ring-plain about 30 miles in diameter, on the S.E. side of\r\nthe Mare Nectaris, midway between Theophilus and Fracastorius, with the\r\nN.E. side of which it is connected by a chain of large depressions. Its\r\nborder is lofty, regular, and continuous on the S. and E., but on the W.\r\nit is low, and on the N. sinks to such a very inconsiderable height that\r\nit is often scarcely traceable. It exhibits two breaks on the S.W.,\r\nthrough one of which passes a coarse valley that ultimately runs on the\r\nE. side of the depressions just referred to. The interior is pitted with\r\nmany craters, one on the W. side being shallow but of considerable size.\r\nI once counted twenty with a 4 inch Cooke achromatic, and Dr. Sheldon of\r\nMacclesfield subsequently noted many more. A ridge, prominent under\r\noblique light, follows a winding course from the N.W. side of Beaumont to\r\nthe W. side of Theophilus, and there is another lower ridge E. of it.\r\nBetween them is included a region covered with minute hillocks and\r\nasperities. Among these objects are certain dusky little crater-cones,\r\nwhich Dr. Klein of Cologne regards as true analogues of some terrestrial\r\nvolcanoes. They are very similar in character to those, already alluded\r\nto, in the dusky area between Copernicus and Gambart.\r\n\r\nKANT.--A conspicuous ring-plain, 23 miles in diameter, situated in a\r\nmountainous district E. of Theophilus, with lofty terraced walls and a\r\nbright central peak. Adjoining it on the W. is a mountain mass,\r\nprojecting from the coast-line of the Mare, on which there is a peak\r\nrising to more than 14,000 feet above the surface.\r\n\r\nFRACASTORIUS.--This great bay or inflexion at the extreme S. end of the\r\nMare Nectaris, about 60 miles in diameter, is one of the largest and most\r\nsuggestive examples of a partially destroyed formation to be found on the\r\nvisible surface. The W. section of the rampart is practically complete\r\nand unbroken, rising at one peak to a height of 6000 feet above the\r\ninterior. It is very broad at its S. end, and its inner slope descends\r\nwith a gentle gradient to the floor. Towards the N., however, it rapidly\r\ndecreases in width, but apparently not in altitude, till near its bright\r\npointed N. extremity. Under a low sun, some long deformed crateriform\r\ndepressions may be seen on the slope, and a bright little crater on the\r\ncrest of the border near its N. end. The southern rampart is broken by\r\nthree large craters, and a fine valley, running some distance in a S.\r\ndirection, which diminishes gradually in width till it ultimately\r\nresembles a cleft, and terminates at a small crater. The E. border is\r\nvery lofty and irregular, rising at the N. corner of the large triangular\r\nformation, which is such a prominent feature upon it, to a height of 7000\r\nfeet, and at a point on the S.E. to considerably more than 8000 feet\r\nabove the floor. N. of the former peak it becomes much lower and\r\nnarrower, and is finally only represented by a very attenuated strip of\r\nwall, hardly more prominent than the brighter portions of the border of\r\nStadius at sunrise, terminating at an obscure semi-ring-plain. Between\r\nthis and the pointed N. termination of the W. border there is a wide gap,\r\nopen to the north for a space of about 30 miles, appearing, except under\r\nvery oblique illumination, as smooth and as devoid of detail as the grey\r\nsurface of the Mare Nectaris itself. If, however, this interval is\r\nobserved at sunrise or sunset, it is seen to be not quite so\r\nstructureless as it appears under different conditions, for a number of\r\nmounds and large humpy swellings, with low hills and craterlets, extend\r\nacross it, and occupy a position which we are justified in regarding as\r\nthe site of a section of the rampart, which, from some cause or other,\r\nhas been completely destroyed and overlaid with the material, whatever\r\nthis may be, of the Mare Nectaris. The floor of Fracastorius is, as\r\nregards the light streaks and other features upon it, only second in\r\ninterest to those of Plato and Archimedes, and will repay systematic\r\nobservation. Between thirty and forty light spots and craters have been\r\nrecorded on its surface, most of them, as in these formations, being\r\nsituated either on or at the edges of the light streaks. On the higher\r\nportion of the interior (near the centre) is a curious object consisting\r\napparently of four light spots, arranged in a square, with a craterlet in\r\nthe middle, all of which undergo (as I have pointed out elsewhere)\r\nnotable changes of aspect under different phases. There are at least two\r\ndistinct clefts on the floor, one running from the W. wall towards the\r\ncentre, and another on the S.E. side of the interior. The last throws out\r\ntwo branches towards the S.W.\r\n\r\nROSSE.--A fine bright deep crater in the Mare Nectaris, N. of the pointed\r\ntermination of the W. wall of Fracastorius, with which it is connected by\r\na bold curved ridge, with a crater upon it. A ray from Tycho, striking\r\nalong the E. wall of Fracastorius passes near this object. A rill from\r\nnear Bohnenberger terminates at this crater.\r\n\r\nPOLYBIUS.--A ring-plain, about 17 miles in diameter, in the hilly region\r\nS.E. of Fracastorius. The border is unbroken, except on the N., where it\r\nis interrupted by a group of depressions. There is a long valley on the\r\nS.W., at the bottom of which Schmidt shows a crater-chain.\r\n\r\nNEANDER.--This ring-plain, 34 miles in diameter, a short distance W.S.W.\r\nof Piccolomini, has a somewhat deformed rampart, which, however, except\r\non the N., where there is a narrow gap occupied by a small crater, is\r\ncontinuous. It rises on the E. nearly 8000 feet above the floor, on which\r\nthere is a central mountain about 2500 feet high. Schmidt shows some\r\nminor hills, a large crater on the N.E. side, and three smaller craters\r\nin the interior.\r\n\r\nPICCOLOMINI.--A ring-plain of a very massive type, about 57 miles in\r\ndiameter, S. of Fracastorius, with complex and prominently terraced\r\nwalls, surmounted by very many peaks; one of which on the E. attains a\r\nheight of 14,000 feet, and another, N. of it, on the same side, an\r\naltitude of 15,000 feet above the interior. The crest of this grand\r\nrampart is tolerably continuous, except on the S.W., where, for a\r\ndistance of twenty miles or more, its character as regards form and\r\nbrightness is entirely changed. Under a low sun, instead of a continuous\r\nbright border, we note a wide gap occupied by a dusky rugged plateau,\r\nwhich falls with a gentle gradient to the floor, and is traversed by\r\nthree or four parallel shallow valleys running towards the S. I can\r\nrecall no lunar formation which presents an appearance at all like this:\r\none is impressed with the idea that it has resulted from the collapse of\r\nthe upper portion of the wall, and the flow of some viscous material over\r\nthe wreck and down the inner slope. The difference between the reflective\r\npower of this matter, whatever may be its nature, and the broad bright\r\ndeclivities of the inner slopes, are beautifully displayed at sunset. The\r\ncross-valleys are more easily traced under low morning illumination; but\r\nto appreciate the actual structure of the wall, it should be observed\r\nunder both phases. The N.W. section of the border includes many\r\n\"pockets,\" or long elliptical depressions, which at an early stage of\r\nsunrise give a scalloped appearance to the crest. Except the great bright\r\ncentral mountain with its numerous peaks, there does not appear to be any\r\nprominent detail on the floor. There is a large ring-plain beyond the\r\nfoot of the _glacis_ on the W. with two craters on the E. side of it,\r\nanother on the S., and a fine rill-valley running up to its N. side from\r\nnear the crest of the W. wall. On the N. side of Piccolomini is a\r\nremarkable group of deformed and overlapping enclosures, mingled with\r\nnumberless craters and little depressions. The plain on the N.E. is\r\ncrossed by a fine cleft.\r\n\r\nPONS.--A complete formation of irregular shape, about 20 miles in\r\ngreatest diameter, on the S.E. side of the Altai range, in W. long. 21\r\ndeg. It consists of a crowd of rings and craters enclosed by a narrow\r\nwall.\r\n\r\nSTIBORIUS.--An elongated ring-plain, about 22 miles in diameter, S. of\r\nPiccolomini, with a lofty wall, broken in one place on the N. by a very\r\nconspicuous crater. Schmidt shows a distinct crater in the centre of the\r\nfloor. I have only seen a central mountain in this position. There is a\r\nlarge crater on the N.W., a ring-plain on the S.W. side, and a multitude\r\nof little craters on the surrounding plain.\r\n\r\nRICCIUS.--A ring-plain, 51 miles in diameter, of a very irregular type,\r\nS.E. of the last. It is enclosed by a complex wall (which is in places\r\ndouble), broken by large rings on the S. The very conspicuous little\r\nring-plain Riccius A is situated on the N. of it, and other less\r\nprominent features. The interior includes a bright crater and some\r\nsmaller objects of the same class.\r\n\r\nZAGUT.--The most easterly of a group of closely associated irregular\r\nwalled-plains, of which Lindenau and Rabbi Levi are the other members,\r\nall evidently deformed and modified in shape by their proximity. It is\r\nabout 45 miles in diameter, and is enclosed by a wall which on the S.W.\r\nattains a height of about 9500 feet, and is much broken on the N. by a\r\nnumber of depressions. A large ring-plain, some 20 miles in diameter,\r\noccupies a considerable portion of the W. side of the interior; E. of\r\nwhich, and nearly central, there is a large bright crater, but apparently\r\nno other conspicuous details. On the S.E. side of Zagut lies an\r\nelliptical ring-plain, about 28 miles in diameter, named by Schmidt\r\nCELSIUS. The border of this is open on the N., the gap being occupied by\r\na large crater, whose S. wall is wanting, so that the interiors of both\r\nformations are in communication.\r\n\r\nLINDENAU.--This formation, about 35 miles in diameter, is bounded on the\r\nW. by a regular unbroken wall nearly 8600 feet in height; but which on\r\nthe E. and N.E. is far loftier and more complex, rising to about 12,000\r\nfeet above the floor, consisting of four or more distinct ramparts,\r\nseparated by deep valleys, and extending towards Rabbi Levi. Neison\r\npoints out that under a high light Lindenau appears to have a bright\r\nuniform single wall. There is a small central mountain and some minor\r\ninequalities in the interior.\r\n\r\nRABBI LEVI.--A larger but less obvious formation than either of its\r\nneighbours, Zagut and Lindenau, abutting on the S. side of them. It is\r\nabout 55 miles in diameter, and is enclosed by a border somewhat\r\ndifficult to trace in its entirety, except under oblique light. There are\r\nsome large craters within it, of which one on the N. side of the floor is\r\nespecially prominent.\r\n\r\nNICOLAI.--A tolerably regular ring-plain, 18 miles in diameter, S. of\r\nRiccius, with a border, rising more than 6000 feet above a level floor,\r\non the N. side of which Schmidt shows a minute crater. The bright plain\r\nsurrounding this formation abounds in small craters; and on the W. is a\r\nnumber of curious enclosures, many of them overlapping.\r\n\r\nVLACQ.--A member of a magnificent group of closely associated formations\r\nsituated on the greatly disturbed area between W. long. 30 deg. and 45\r\ndeg. and S. lat. 50 deg. and 60 deg. It is 57 miles in diameter, and is\r\nenclosed by terraced walls, rising on the W. about 8000 feet, and on the\r\nE. more than 10,000 feet above the floor. They are broken on the S. by a\r\nfine crater. In addition to a conspicuous central peak, there are several\r\nsmall craters, and low short ridges in the interior.\r\n\r\nHOMMEL.--Adjoins Vlacq on the S. It is a somewhat larger and a far more\r\nirregular formation. On every side except the W., where the border is\r\nunbroken, and descends with a gentle slope to the dark interior; ring-\r\nplains and smaller depressions encroach on its outline, perhaps the most\r\nremarkable being Hommel _a_ on the N., which has an especially brilliant\r\nwall, that includes a conspicuous central mountain, a large crater, and\r\nother details. The best phase for observing Hommel and its surroundings\r\nis when the W. wall is just within the evening terminator.\r\n\r\nPITISCUS.--The most regular of the Vlacq group. It is situated on the\r\nN.E. of Hommel (a curious oblong-shaped enclosure, Hommel _h_, with a\r\nvery attenuated E. wall, and a large crater on a floor, standing at a\r\nhigher level than that of Pitiscus, intervening). It is 52 miles in\r\ndiameter, and is surrounded by an apparently continuous rampart, except\r\non the E., where there is a crater, and on the S.W., where it abuts on\r\nHommel _h_. Here there is a wide gap crossed by what has every appearance\r\nof being a \"fault,\" resembling that in Phocylides on a smaller scale.\r\nThere is a fine crater on the N. side of the interior connected with the\r\nS. wall by a bright ridge. Just beyond the E. border there is a shallow\r\nring-plain of a very extraordinary shape.\r\n\r\nNEARCH.--A ring-plain, about 35 miles in diameter, on the S.W. of Hommel,\r\nforming part of the Vlacq group.\r\n\r\nTANNERUS.--A ring-plain, about 19 miles in diameter, between Mutus and\r\nBacon. It has a central mountain.\r\n\r\nMUTUS.--A fine but foreshortened walled plain, 51 miles in diameter.\r\nThere are two ring-plains of about equal size on the floor, one on the\r\nN., and the other on the S. side. The wall on the W. rises to nearly\r\n14,000 feet above the interior.\r\n\r\nMANZINUS.--A walled plain, nearly 62 miles in diameter, with a terraced\r\nrampart rising to a height of more than 14,500 feet above the interior.\r\nSchmidt shows three craterlets on the floor, but no traces of the small\r\ncentral peak which is said to stand thereon, but to be only visible in\r\nlarge telescopes.\r\n\r\nSCHOMBERGER.--A large walled-plain adjoining Simpelius on the S.W. Too\r\nnear the limb for satisfactory observation.\r\n\r\n\r\nWEST LONGITUDE 20 deg. TO 0 deg.\r\n\r\n\r\nDELAMBRE.--A conspicuous ring-plain, 32 miles in diameter, a little S. of\r\nthe equator, in W. long. 17 deg. 30 min., with a massive polygonal\r\nborder, terraced within, rising on the W. to the great height of 15,000\r\nfeet above the interior, but to little more than half this on the\r\nopposite side. Its outline approximates to that of a pentagon with\r\nslightly curved sides. A section on the S.E. exhibits an inflexion\r\ntowards the centre. The crest is everywhere continuous except on the N.,\r\nwhere it is broken by a deep crater with a bright rim. The north-easterly\r\ntrend of the ridges and hillocks on the E. is especially noteworthy. The\r\ncentral peak is not prominent, but close under it on the E. is a deep\r\nfissure, extending from near the centre, and dying out before it reaches\r\nthe S. border. At the foot of the N.E. _glacis_ there are traces of a\r\nring with low walls.\r\n\r\nTHEON, SEN.--A brilliant little ring-plain, E.N.E. of Delambre, 11 miles\r\nin diameter, and of great depth, with a regular and perfectly unbroken\r\nwall. North of it is a bright little crater.\r\n\r\nTHEON, JUN.--A ring-plain similar in size and in other respects to the\r\nlast, situated about 23 miles S. of it on a somewhat dusky surface.\r\nBetween the pair is a curious oblong-shaped mountain mass; and on the E.\r\na long cliff (of no great altitude, but falling steeply on the E. side)\r\nextending S. towards Taylor _a_. Just below the escarpment, I find a\r\nbrilliant little pair of craterlets, of which Neison only shows one.\r\n\r\nALFRAGANUS.--A large bright crater, about 9 miles in diameter, with very\r\nsteep walls, some distance S.S.W. of Delambre, and standing on the W.\r\nedge of a large but very shallow and irregular depression W. of Taylor.\r\nThere is a remarkable chain of craters on the W. of it. Alfraganus is the\r\ncentre of a system of light streaks radiating in all directions, one ray\r\nextending through Cyrillus to Fracastorius.\r\n\r\nTAYLOR.--A deep spindle-shaped ring-plain, S. of Delambre, about 22 miles\r\nin length. The wall appears to be everywhere continuous, except at the\r\nextreme N. and S. ends, where there are small craters. The outer slopes,\r\nboth on the E. and W., are very broad and prominent, but apparently not\r\nterraced. There is an inconspicuous central hill. On the W. is the\r\nirregular enclosure, already referred to under Alfraganus. Three or four\r\nshort winding valleys traverse the N. edge of this formation, and descend\r\nto the dark floor. On the N.E. is the remarkable ring-plain Taylor _a_,\r\n18 miles in diameter, rising, at an almost isolated mountain mass on the\r\nE. border, to a height of 7000 feet above the interior. The more regular\r\nand W. section of this formation is not so lofty, and falls with a gentle\r\nslope to the dark uneven floor, on which there is some detail in the\r\nshape of small bright ridges and mounds. On the surface, N.W. of Taylor\r\n_a_, is a curious linear row of bright little hills. Taylor and the\r\nvicinity is better seen under low evening illumination than under morning\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nHIPPARCHUS.--Except under a low sun, this immense walled-plain is by no\r\nmeans so striking an object as a glance at its representation on a chart\r\nof the moon would lead one to expect; for the border, in nearly every\r\npart of it, bears unmistakable evidence of wreck and ruin, its continuity\r\nbeing interrupted by depressions, transverse valleys, and gaps, and it\r\nnowhere attains a great altitude. This imperfect enclosure extends 97\r\nmiles from N. to S., and about 88 miles from E. to W., and in shape\r\napproximates to that of a rhombus with curved sides. One of the most\r\nprominent bright craters on its border is Hipparchus G, on the W.\r\nAnother, of about the same size, is Hipparchus E, on the N. of Horrocks.\r\nOn the E. there is a moderately bright crater, Hipparchus F; and S. of\r\nthis, on the same side, two others, K and I. The interior is crossed by\r\nmany ridges, and near the centre includes the relics of a low ring,\r\ntraversed by a narrow rill-like valley. Schmidt shows a cleft running\r\nfrom F across the floor to the S. border.\r\n\r\n[A valuable monograph of Hipparchus, by Mr. W.B. Birt, was published in\r\n1870.]\r\n\r\nHORROCKS.--This fine ring-plain, 18 miles in diameter, stands on the N.\r\nside of the interior of Hipparchus, close to the border. It has a\r\ncontinuous wall, rising on the E. to a height of nearly 8000 feet above\r\nthe interior, and a distinct central mountain.\r\n\r\nHALLEY.--A ring-plain, 21 miles in diameter, on the S.W. border of\r\nHipparchus, with a bright wall, rising at one point on the E. to a height\r\nof 7500 feet above the floor, which is depressed about 4000 feet below\r\nthe surface. Two craterlets on the floor, one discovered by Birt on\r\nRutherfurd's photogram of 1865, and the other by Gaudibert, raised a\r\nsuspicion of recent lunar activity within this ring. A magnificent\r\nvalley, shown in part by Schmidt as a crater-row, runs from the S. of\r\nHalley to the W. side of Albategnius.\r\n\r\nHIND.--A ring-plain, 16 miles in diameter, a few miles W. of Halley, with\r\na peak on its E. wall 10,000 feet above the floor. The border is broken\r\nboth on the S.E. and N.E. by small craters.\r\n\r\n[Horrocks, Halley, and Hind may be regarded as strictly belonging to\r\nHipparchus.]\r\n\r\nALBATEGNIUS.--A magnificent walled-plain, 65 miles in diameter, adjoining\r\nHipparchus on the S., surrounded by a massive complex rampart,\r\nprominently terraced, including many depressions, and crossed by several\r\nvalleys. It is surmounted by very lofty peaks, one of which on the N.E.\r\nstands nearly 15,000 feet above the floor. The great ring-plain\r\nAlbategnius A, 28 miles in diameter, intrudes far within the limits of\r\nthe formation on the E., and its towering crest rises more than 10,000\r\nfeet above its floor, on which there is a small central mountain. The\r\ncentral mountain of Albategnius is more than 4000 feet high, and, with\r\nthe exception of a few minor elevations, is the only prominent feature in\r\nthe interior, though there are many small craters. Schmidt counted forty\r\nwith the Berlin refractor, among them 12 on the E. side, arranged like a\r\nstring of pearls.\r\n\r\nPARROT.--An irregularly-shaped formation, 41 miles in diameter, S. of\r\nAlbategnius, with a very discontinuous margin, interrupted on every side\r\nby gaps and depressions, large and small; the most considerable of which\r\nis the regular ring-plain Parrot _a_, on the E. An especially fine\r\nvalley, shown by Schmidt to consist in part of large inosculating\r\ncraters, cuts through the wall on the S.W., and runs on the E. side of\r\nArgelander towards Airy. The floor of Parrot is very rugged.\r\n\r\nDESCARTES.--This object, about 30 miles in diameter, situated N.W. of\r\nAbulfeda, is bounded by ill-defined, broken, and comparatively low walls;\r\ninterrupted on the S.E. by a fine crater, Descartes A, and on the S.W. by\r\nanother, smaller. There is also a brilliant crater outside on the N.W.\r\nSchmidt shows a crater-row on the floor, which I have seen as a cleft.\r\n\r\nDOLLOND.--A bright crater, about 6 miles in diameter, on the N.E. side of\r\nDescartes. Between it and the latter there is a rill-valley.\r\n\r\nTACITUS.--A bright ring-plain, about 28 miles in diameter, a few miles E.\r\nof Catherina, with a lofty wall rising both on the E. and W. to more than\r\n11,000 feet above the floor. Its continuity is broken on the N. by a gap\r\noccupied by a depression, and there is a conspicuous crater below the\r\ncrest on the S.W. The central mountain is connected with the N. wall by a\r\nridge, recalling the same arrangement within Madler. A range of lofty\r\nhills, an offshoot of the Altai range, extends from Tacitus towards\r\nFermat.\r\n\r\nALMANON.--This ring-plain, with its companion Abulfeda on the N.E., is a\r\nvery interesting telescopic object. It is about 36 miles in diameter, and\r\nis surrounded by an irregular border of polygonal shape, the greatest\r\naltitude of which is about 6000 feet above the floor on the W. It is\r\nslightly terraced, and is broken on the S. by a deep crater pertaining to\r\nthe bright and large formation Tacitus _b_, the E. border of which casts\r\na fine double-peaked shadow at sunrise. On the N.W. there is another\r\nbright crater, the largest of the row, running in a W.S.W. direction, and\r\nforming a W. extension of the remarkable crater-chain tangential to the\r\nborders of Almanon and Abulfeda. The only objects on the floor are three\r\nlittle hills, in a line, near the centre, a winding ridge on the W. side\r\nof it, and two or three other low elevations.\r\n\r\nABULFEDA.--A larger and more massive formation than Almanon, 39 miles in\r\ndiameter, the E. wall rising about 10,000 feet above the interior, which\r\nis depressed more than 3000 feet. It is continuous on the W., but much\r\nbroken by transverse valleys on the S.E., and by little depressions on\r\nthe N. On the S.E. originates the very curious bright crater-row which\r\nruns in a straight line to the N.W. wall of Almanon, crossing for the\r\nfirst few miles the lofty table-land lying on the S.E. side of the\r\nborder. With the exception of a low central mountain, the interior of\r\nAbulfeda contains no visible detail. The rampart is finely terraced on\r\nthe E. and W. The E. _glacis_ is very rugged.\r\n\r\nARGELANDER.--This conspicuous ring-plain, about 20 miles in diameter, is,\r\nif we except two smaller inosculating rings on the S.W. flank of\r\nAlbategnius, the most northerly of a remarkable serpentine chain of seven\r\nmoderately-sized formations, extending for nearly 180 miles from the S.W.\r\nof Parrot to the N. side of Blanchinus. Its border is lofty, slightly\r\nterraced within, and includes a central peak.\r\n\r\nAIRY.--About 22 miles in diameter, connected with Argelander by a\r\ndepression bounded by linear walls. Its border, double on the S.E., is\r\nbroken on the S. by a prominent crater, with a smaller companion on the\r\nW. of it; and again on the N.E. by another not so conspicuous. It has a\r\ncentral peak. The next link in the chain of ring-plains is Airy _c_, a\r\nvery irregular object, somewhat larger, and with, for the most part,\r\nlinear walls.\r\n\r\nDONATI.--A ring-plain on the S. of Airy _c_, about 22 miles in greatest\r\nlength. It is very irregular in outline, with a lofty broken border,\r\nespecially on the N. and S., where there are wide gaps. There is another\r\nring on the S.E.\r\n\r\nFAYE.--The direction of the chain swerves considerably towards the E. at\r\nthis formation, which resembles Donati both in size and in irregularity\r\nof outline. The wall, where it is not broken, is slightly terraced. There\r\nis a craterlet on the S. rim and a central crater in the interior.\r\n\r\nDELAUNAY.--Adjoins Faye on the S.E., and is a larger and more complex\r\nobject, of irregular form, with very lofty peaks on its border. A\r\nprominent ridge of great height traverses the formation from N. to S.,\r\nabutting on the W. border of Lacaille. Delaunay is the last link in the\r\nchain commencing with Argelander.\r\n\r\nLACAILLE.--An oblong enclosure situated on the N. side of Blanchinus, and\r\napparently about 30 miles in greatest diameter. The border is to a great\r\nextent linear and continuous on the N., but elsewhere abounds in\r\ndepressions. Two large inosculating ring-plains are associated with the\r\nN.E. wall.\r\n\r\nBLANCHINUS.--A large walled-plain on the W. of Purbach and abutting on\r\nthe S. side of Lacaille. It much resembles Purbach in shape, but has\r\nlower walls. Schmidt shows a crater on the N. side of the floor, which I\r\nhave seen, and a number of parallel ridges which have not been noted,\r\nprobably because they are only visible under very oblique light.\r\n\r\nGEBER.--A bright ring-plain, 25 miles in diameter, S. of Almanon, with a\r\nregular border, rising to a height on the W. of nearly 9000 feet above\r\nthe floor. There is a small crater on the crest of the S. wall, and\r\nanother on the N. A ring-plain about 8 miles in diameter adjoins the\r\nformation on the N.E. According to Neison, there is a feeble central\r\nhill, which, however, is not shown by Schmidt.\r\n\r\nSACROBOSCO.--This is one of those extremely abnormal formations which are\r\nalmost peculiar to certain regions in the fourth quadrant. It is about 50\r\nmiles in greatest diameter, and is enclosed by a rampart of unequal\r\nheight, rising on the E. to 12,000 feet above the floor, but sinking in\r\nplaces to a very moderate altitude. On the N. its contour is, if\r\npossible, rendered still more irregular by the intrusion of a smaller\r\nring-plain. On the N.E. side of the floor stands a very bright little\r\ncrater and two others on the S. of the centre, each with central\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\nFERMAT.--An irregular ring-plain 25 miles in diameter on the W. of\r\nSacrobosco. Its partially terraced wall is broken on the N. by a gap\r\nwhich communicates with the interior of a smaller formation. There are\r\nsome low hills on the floor, which is depressed 6000 feet below the crest\r\nof the border.\r\n\r\nAZOPHI.--A prominent ring-plain, 30 miles in diameter, E.N.E. of\r\nSacrobosco, its lofty barrier towering nearly 11,000 feet above a\r\nsomewhat dusky interior, which includes some light spots. A massive\r\ncurved mountain arm runs from the S. side of this formation to a small\r\nring-plain W. of Playfair.\r\n\r\nABENEZRA.--When observed near the morning terminator, this noteworthy\r\nring-plain, 27 miles in diameter, seems to be divided into two by a\r\ncurved ridge which traverses the formation from N. to S., and extends\r\nbeyond its limits. The irregular border rises on the W. to a height of\r\nmore than 14,000 feet above the deeply-sunken floor, which includes\r\nseveral craters, hills, and ridges.\r\n\r\nAPIANUS.--A magnificent ring-plain, 38 miles in diameter, N.W. of\r\nAliacensis, with lofty terraced walls, rising on the N.E. to about 9000\r\nfeet above the interior, and crowned on the W. by three large conspicuous\r\ncraters. The border is broken on the N. by a smaller depression and a\r\nlarge ring with low walls. The dark-grey floor appears to be devoid of\r\nconspicuous detail.\r\n\r\nPLAYFAIR.--A ring-plain, 28 miles in diameter, with massive walls. It is\r\nsituated on the N. of Apianus, and is connected with it by a mountain\r\narm. The rampart is tolerably continuous, but varies considerably in\r\naltitude, rising on the S. to a height of more than 8000 feet above the\r\ninterior. On the E., extending towards Blanchinus, is a magnificent\r\nunnamed formation, bounded on the E. by a broad lofty rampart flanking\r\nBlanchinus, Lacaille, Delaunay, and Faye; and on the W. by Playfair and\r\nthe mountain arm just mentioned. It is fully 60 miles in length from N.\r\nto S. Sunrise on this region affords a fine spectacle to the observer\r\nwith a large telescope. The best phase is when the morning terminator\r\nintersects Aliacensis, as at this time the long jagged shadows of the E.\r\nwall of Playfair and of the mountain arm are very prominent on the\r\nsmooth, greyish-blue surface of this immense enclosure.\r\n\r\nPONTANUS.--An irregular ring-plain, 28 miles in diameter, S.S.W. of\r\nAzophi, with a low broken border, interrupted on the S.W. by a smaller\r\nring-plain, which forms one of a group extending towards the S.W. The\r\ndark floor includes a central mountain.\r\n\r\nALIACENSIS.--This ring-plain, 53 miles in diameter, with its neighbour\r\nWerner on the N.E., are beautiful telescopic objects under a low sun. Its\r\nlofty terraced border rises at one peak on the E. to the tremendous\r\nheight of 16,500 feet, and at another on the opposite side to nearly\r\n12,000 feet above the floor. The wall on the S. is broken by a crater,\r\nand on the W. traversed by narrow passes. There is also a prominent\r\ncrater on the inner slope of the N.E. wall. The floor includes a small\r\nmountain, several little hills, and a crater.\r\n\r\nWERNER.--A ring-plain, 45 miles in diameter, with a massive rampart\r\ncrowned by peaks almost as lofty as any on that of Aliacensis, and with\r\nterraces fully as conspicuous. It has a magnificent central mountain,\r\n4500 feet high. At the foot of the N.E. wall Madler observed a small\r\narea, which he describes as rivalling the central peak of Aristarchus in\r\nbrilliancy. Webb, however, was unable to confirm this estimate, though he\r\nnoted it as very bright, and saw a minute black pit and narrow ravine\r\nwithin it. Neison subsequently found that the black pit is a crater-cone.\r\nIt would perhaps be rash, with our limited knowledge of minute lunar\r\ndetail, to assert that Madler over-estimated the brightness of this area,\r\nwhich may have been due to a _recent_ deposit round the orifice of the\r\ncrater-cone.\r\n\r\nPOISSON.--An irregular formation on the W. of Aliacensis, extending about\r\n50 miles from W. to E., but much less in a meridional direction. Its N.\r\nlimits are marked by a number of overlapping ring-plains and craters, and\r\nit is much broken elsewhere by smaller depressions. The E. wall is about\r\n7000 feet in height.\r\n\r\nGEMMA FRISIUS.--A great composite walled-plain, 80 miles or more in\r\nlength from N. to S., with a wall rising at one place nearly 14,000 feet\r\nabove the floor. It is broken on the N. by two fine ring-plains, each\r\nabout 20 miles in diameter, and on the E. by a third open to the E. There\r\nis a central mountain, and several small craters on the floor, especially\r\non the W. side.\r\n\r\nBUSCHING.--A ring-plain S. of Zagut, about 36 miles in diameter, with a\r\nmoderately high but irregular wall. There are several craterlets within\r\nand some low hills.\r\n\r\nBUCH.--Adjoins Busching on the S.E. It is about 31 miles in diameter, and\r\nhas a less broken barrier. There is a large crater on the E. wall, and\r\nanother smaller one on the S.W. Schmidt shows nothing on the floor, but\r\nNeison noted two minute crater-cones.\r\n\r\nMAUROLYCUS.--This unquestionably ranks as one of the grandest walled-\r\nplains on the moon's visible surface, and when viewed under a low sun\r\npresents a spectacle which is not easily effaced from the mind. Like so\r\nmany of the great enclosures in the fourth quadrant, it impresses one\r\nwith the notion that we have here the result of the crowding together of\r\na number of large rings which, when they were in a semi-fluid or viscous\r\ncondition, mutually deformed each other. It extends fully 150 miles from\r\nE. to W., and more from N. to S.; so it may be taken to include an area\r\non the lunar globe which is, roughly speaking, equal to half the\r\nsuperficies of Ireland. This vast space, bounded by one of the loftiest,\r\nmost massive, and prominently-terraced ramparts, includes ring-plains,\r\ncraters, crater-rows, and valleys,--in short, almost every type of lunar\r\nformation. It towers on the E. to a height of nearly 14,000 feet above\r\nthe interior, and on the W., according to Schmidt, to a still greater\r\naltitude. A fine rill-valley curves round the outer slope of the W. wall,\r\njust below its crest, which is an easy object in a 8 1/2 inch reflector\r\nwhen the opposite border is on the morning terminator, and could\r\ndoubtless be seen in a smaller instrument; and there is an especially\r\nbrilliant crater on the S. border, which is not visible till a somewhat\r\nlater stage of sunrise. The central mountain is of great altitude, its\r\nloftiest peaks standing out amid the shadow long before a ray of sunlight\r\nhas reached the lower slopes of the walls. It is associated with a number\r\nof smaller elevations. I have seen three considerable craters and several\r\nsmaller ones in the interior.\r\n\r\nBAROCIUS.--A massive formation, about 50 miles in diameter, on the S.W.\r\nside of Maurolycus, whose border it overlaps and considerably deforms.\r\nIts wall rises on the E. to a height of 12,000 feet above the floor, and\r\nis broken on the N.W. by two great ring-plains. On the inner slope of the\r\nS.E. border is a curious oblong enclosure. There is nothing remarkable in\r\nthe interior. On the dusky grey plain W. of Maurolycus and Barocius there\r\nis a number of little formations, many of them being of a very abnormal\r\nshape, which are well worthy of examination. I have seen two short\r\nunrecorded clefts in connection with these objects.\r\n\r\nSTOFLER.--A grand object, very similar in size and general character to\r\nMaurolycus, its neighbour on the W. To view it and its surroundings at\r\nthe most striking phase, it should be observed when the morning\r\nterminator lies a little E. of the W. wall. At this time the jagged,\r\nclean-cut, shadows of the peaks on Faraday and the W. border, the fine\r\nterraces, depressions, and other features on the illuminated section of\r\nthe gigantic rampart, and the smooth bluish-grey floor, combine to make a\r\nmost beautiful telescopic picture. At a peak on the N.E., the wall\r\nattains a height of nearly 12,000 feet, but sinks to a little more than a\r\nthird of this height on the E. It is apparently loftiest on the N. The\r\nmost conspicuous of the many craters upon it is the bright deep circular\r\ndepression E. on the S. wall, and another, rather larger and less\r\nregular, on the N.W., which has a very low rim on the side facing the\r\nfloor, and a craterlet on either side of the apparent gap. A large\r\nlozenge-shaped enclosure abuts on the wall, near the crater E., with a\r\nborder crowned by a number of little peaks, which at an early stage of\r\nsunrise resemble a chaplet of pearls. The floor of Stofler is apparently\r\nvery level, and in colour recalls the beautiful steel-grey tone of Plato\r\nseen under certain conditions. I have noted several distinct little\r\ncraters on its surface, mostly on the N.E. side; and on the E. side a\r\ntriangular dark patch, close to the foot of the wall, very similar in\r\nsize and appearance to those within Alphonsus.\r\n\r\nFARADAY.--A large ring-plain, about 35 miles in diameter, overlapping the\r\nS.W. border of Stofler; its own rampart being overlapped in its turn by\r\ntwo smaller ring-plains on the S.E., and by two still smaller formations\r\n(one of which is square-shaped) on the N.W. The wall is broad and very\r\nmassive on the E. and N.E., prominently terraced, and includes many\r\nbrilliant little craters. Schmidt shows a ridge and several craters in\r\nthe interior.\r\n\r\nLICETUS.--An irregular formation, about 50 miles in maximum width, on the\r\nS. of Stofler, with the flanks of which it is connected by a coarse\r\nvalley. Neison points out that it consists of a group of ring-plains\r\nunited into one, owing to the separating walls having been partially\r\ndestroyed. This seems to be clearly the case, if Licetus is examined\r\nunder a low sun. On the E. side of the N. portion of the formation, the\r\nwall rises to nearly 13,000 feet.\r\n\r\nFERNELIUS.--A ring-plain, about 30 miles in diameter, abutting on the N.\r\nwall of Stofler. It is overlapped on the E. by another similar formation\r\nof about half its size. There are many craters and depressions on the\r\nborders of both, and a large crater between the smaller enclosure and the\r\nN.E. outer slope of Stofler. Schmidt shows eight craters on the floor of\r\nFernelius.\r\n\r\nNONIUS.--A ring-plain, about 20 miles in diameter, abutting on the N.\r\nwall of Fernelius. There is a prominent bright crater on the W. of it,\r\nand another on the N., from which a delicate valley runs towards the W.\r\nside of Walter.\r\n\r\nCLAIRAUT.--A very peculiar formation, about 40 miles in diameter, S. of\r\nMaurolycus, affording another good example of interference and\r\noverlapping. The continuity of its border, nowhere very regular, has been\r\nentirely destroyed on the S. by the subsequent formation of two large\r\nrings, some 10 or 12 miles in diameter, the more easterly of which has,\r\nin its turn, been partially wrecked on the N. by a smaller object of the\r\nsame class. There is also a ring-plain N.E. of Clairaut, which has very\r\nclearly modified the shape of the border on this side. Two craters on the\r\nfloor of Clairaut are easy objects.\r\n\r\nBACON.--A very fine ring-plain, 40 miles in diameter, S.W. of Clairaut.\r\nAt one peak on the E. the terraced wall rises to nearly 14,000 feet above\r\nthe interior. It is broken on the S. by three or four craters. On the W.\r\nthere is an irregular inconspicuous enclosure, whose contiguity has\r\napparently modified the shape of the border. There are two large rings on\r\nthe N. (the more easterly having a central peak), and a third on the E.\r\nThe floor appears to be devoid of prominent detail.\r\n\r\nCUVIER.--A walled-plain, about 50 miles in diameter, on the S.E. of\r\nClairaut. The border on the E. rises to 12,000 feet; and on the N.W. is\r\nmuch broken by depressions. Neison has seen a mound, with a minute crater\r\nW. of it, on the otherwise undisturbed interior.\r\n\r\nJACOBI.--A ring-plain S. of Cuvier, about 40 miles in diameter, with\r\nwalls much broken on the N. and S., but rising on the E. to nearly 10,000\r\nfeet. There is a group of craters (nearly central) on the floor. The\r\nregion S. of this formation abounds in large unnamed objects.\r\n\r\nLILIUS.--An irregular ring-plain, 39 miles in diameter, with a rampart on\r\nthe E. nearly 10,000 feet above the floor. A smaller ring between it and\r\nJacobi has considerably inflected the wall towards the interior. It has a\r\nconspicuous central mountain.\r\n\r\nZACH.--A massive formation, 46 miles in diameter, on the S. of Lilius,\r\nwith prominently terraced walls, rising on the E. to 13,000 feet above\r\nthe interior. A small ring-plain, whose wall stands 6000 feet above the\r\nfloor, is associated with the N. border. Two other rings, on the S.W. and\r\nN.E. respectively, have craters on their ramparts and central hills.\r\n\r\nPENTLAND.--A fine conspicuous formation under a low sun, even in a region\r\nabounding in such objects. It is about 50 miles in diameter, with a\r\nborder exceeding in places 10,000 feet in height above the floor, which\r\nincludes an especially fine central mountain.\r\n\r\nKINAU.--One of the group of remarkable ring-plains extending in a N.W.\r\ndirection from Pentland.\r\n\r\nSIMPELIUS.--Another grand circumvallation, almost as large as Pentland,\r\nbut unfortunately much foreshortened. One of its peaks on the E. rises to\r\na height of more than 12,000 feet above the floor, on which there is a\r\nsmall central mountain. Between Simpelius and Pentland are several ring-\r\nplains, most of which appear to have been squeezed and deformed into\r\nabnormal shapes.\r\n\r\nCURTIUS.--A magnificent formation, about 50 miles in diameter, with one\r\nof the loftiest ramparts on the visible surface, rising at a mountain\r\nmass on the N.E. to more than 22,000 feet, an altitude which is only\r\nsurpassed by peaks on the walls of Newton and Casatus. There is a bright\r\ncrater on the S.E. border and another on the W. The formation is too near\r\nthe S. limb for satisfactory scrutiny. Between Curtius and Zach is a fine\r\ngroup of unnamed enclosures.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE MAP\r\n\r\n\r\nThe accompanying map, eighteen inches in diameter, represents the moon\r\nunder mean libration. Meridian lines and parallels of latitude are drawn\r\nat every 10 deg., except in the case of the meridians of 80 deg. E. and\r\nW. longitude, which are omitted to avoid confusion, and as being\r\npractically needless. These lines will enable the observer, with the aid\r\nof the Tables in the Appendix, to find the position of the terminator at\r\nany time required. As astronomical telescopes exhibit objects inverted,\r\nmaps of the moon are always drawn upside down, and with the right and\r\nleft interchanged, as in the diagram above, which also shows how the\r\nquadrants are numbered.\r\n\r\nThis circle [drawing of circle], intended to be .15708 in diameter,\r\nrepresents a circle of one degree in diameter at the centre of the map,\r\nand as the length of one selenographical degree is 18.871 miles, it\r\nrepresents an area of nearly 280 square miles.\r\n\r\nThe catalogue is so arranged that, beginning with the W. limb, and\r\nreferring to the lists under the first and fourth, and the second and\r\nthird quadrants, all the formations falling within the meridians 90 deg.\r\nto 60 deg., 60 deg. to 40 deg., 40 deg. to 20 deg., 20 deg. to 0 deg.\r\n(the central meridian), and from 0 deg. to 20 deg., and so on, to the E.\r\nlimb, will be found in convenient proximity in the text.\r\n\r\nIn the Catalogue, N. S. E. W. are used as abbreviations for the cardinal\r\npoints.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIST OF THE MARIA, OR GREY PLAINS, TERMED \"SEAS,\" &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST QUADRANT.\r\n\r\nMare Tranquilitatis (nearly the whole), page 5.\r\n,,   Foecunditatis (the N. portion), 5.\r\n,,   Serenitatis, 5.\r\n,,   Crisium, 6.\r\n,,   Frigoris (a portion), 5.\r\n,,   Vaporum (nearly the whole), 6.\r\n,,   Humboldtianum, 6.\r\n,,   Smythii (a portion), 39.\r\nLacus Mortis, 53.\r\n,,    Somniorum.\r\nPalus Somnii.\r\n,,    Nebularum (a portion), 62.\r\n,,    Putredinis, 61.\r\nSinus Medii (a portion), 6.\r\n\r\nSECOND QUADRANT.\r\n\r\nMare Imbrium, 5.\r\n,,   Nubium (the N. portion), 5.\r\n,,   Frigoris (a portion), 5.\r\n,,   Vaporum (a portion), 6.\r\nOceanus Procellarum (the N. portion), 5.\r\nPalus Nebularum (a portion), 62.\r\nSinus Iridum, 80.\r\n,,    Medii (a portion), 6.\r\n,,    Roris, 90.\r\n,,    Aestuum.\r\n\r\nTHIRD QUADRANT.\r\n\r\nMare Nubium (the greater portion), 5.\r\n,,   Humorum, 6.\r\nOceanus Procellarum (the S. portion), 5.\r\nSinus Medii (a small portion), 6.\r\n\r\nFOURTH QUADRANT.\r\n\r\nMare Foecunditatis (the greater portion), 5.\r\n,,   Nectaris, 7.\r\n,,   Tranquilitatis (a small portion), 5.\r\n,,   Australe, 127.\r\n,,   Smythii (a portion), 39.\r\nSinus Medii (a portion), 6.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIST OF SOME OF THE MOST PROMINENT MOUNTAIN RANGES, PROMONTORIES,\r\nISOLATED MOUNTAINS, AND REMARKABLE HILLS.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST QUADRANT.\r\n\r\nThe Alps.
