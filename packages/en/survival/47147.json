Hence it happened that in 1807 not\r\nmore than four meteoric stones were in the British Museum: three of\r\nthem, _Krakhut_, _Wold Cottage_ and _Siena_, had been presented in\r\n1802-3 by Sir Joseph Banks; the fourth was a stone of the _L'Aigle_\r\nfall, presented in 1804 by Prof. Biot, the distinguished physicist.\r\nA fragment of the mass met with by the traveller Pallas had been\r\npresented by the Academy of Sciences of St. Petersburg as early as\r\n1776; this, and the fragments of _Otumpa_ and _Senegal River_, were\r\nlong regarded by scientific men as specimens of \"native iron,\" and of\r\nterrestrial origin.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1807, happily for the future development of the Mineral\r\nCollection, Mr. Charles Konig (formerly König) was appointed\r\nAssistant-keeper, and six years later was promoted to the Keepership\r\nof the then undivided Natural History Department; it thus came about\r\nthat for thirty-eight years the senior officer of the Natural History\r\nDepartment of the Museum was one who had an intense enthusiasm for\r\nminerals and made them his own special study. It was in Mr. Konig's\r\ntime that Parliament voted (1810) a special grant of nearly £14,000\r\nfor the purchase of the minerals which had belonged to the Rt. Hon.\r\nCharles Greville; with these passed into the possession of the Trustees\r\nfragments of seven meteorites, including _Tabor_, which had been\r\nacquired by Mr. Greville with the mineral cabinet of Baron Born. The\r\nincrease of the Natural History Collections was such that in 1827 the\r\nBotanical, and in 1837 the Zoological, specimens were assigned to\r\nspecial Departments, after which Mr. Konig, as Keeper of \"Minerals\r\n(including Fossils),\" was left free to devote his attention to those\r\nparts of Natural History to which he was more particularly attached.\r\n\r\nDuring Mr. Konig's Keepership, though numerous and excellent mineral\r\nspecimens were acquired, no great effort was made to render the\r\nmeteorite collection itself complete; at his death in 1851, 70 falls\r\nwere represented by specimens. The following had been presented:--\r\n\r\n_Stannern:_ by the Imperial Museum of Vienna, in 1814.\r\n\r\n_Red River:_ by Prof. A. Bruce, in 1814.\r\n\r\n_Mooresfort:_ by Mr. J. G. Children, F.R.S., in 1817, and by Dr. Blake,\r\nin 1819.\r\n\r\n_Adare:_ by Dr. Blake, in 1819.\r\n\r\nThe large _Otumpa_ iron, and a piece of the _Imilac_ siderolite: by Sir\r\nWoodbine Parish, K.C.B., F.R.S., in 1826 and 1828 respectively.\r\n\r\n_Bitburg:_ by Mr. Henry Heuland, in 1831.\r\n\r\n_Krakhut:_ by Mr. Wm. Marsden, in 1834.\r\n\r\n_Cold Bokkeveld_ meteorite: by Sir John Herschel, Bart., F.R.S., Sir\r\nThos. Maclear, F.R.S., and Mr. E. Charlesworth, in 1839 and 1845.\r\n\r\n_Zacatecas:_ by Mr. T. Parkinson, in 1840.\r\n\r\n_Akbarpur:_ by Captain P. T. Cautley, in 1843.\r\n\r\n_Braunau_ and _Seeläsgen:_ by the Royal Society, in 1848.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Mr. Konig, Mr. G. R. Waterhouse, palæontologist,\r\nwas appointed Keeper of the composite Department. It was natural\r\nthat the palæontological side should then have its turn of special\r\ndevelopment, and in fact the palæontological collections, already\r\nimportant, increased from that time with great rapidity; the\r\nmineralogical side, however, had additions made to it, though not\r\nin the proportion allotted during the preceding years. During the\r\nKeepership of Mr. Waterhouse (1851-7), only specimens of two additional\r\nmeteorites were added to the collection; one of them, _Madoc_, was\r\npresented in 1856 by Sir Wm. E. Logan, F.R.S.; also additional\r\nfragments of _Imilac_ were presented by Mr. W. Bollaert in 1857.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1857, a further division of the Natural History Collections\r\ntook place; the mineralogical and the palæontological specimens being\r\nassigned to special Departments, and the Minerals placed in the\r\nKeepership of Prof. Story-Maskelyne. Under him the Mineral Collection\r\nwas rendered as complete as possible in all its branches; and it is\r\nowing entirely to the unflagging energy he displayed, both in the\r\nsearch for, and in the acquisition of the best obtainable specimens,\r\nthat the Mineral Collection was brought to its present position of\r\ngeneral excellence. Perhaps the greatest relative advance was made\r\nin the improvement of the Collection of Meteorites. Perceiving that\r\nonly half of the falls represented at Vienna were represented in the\r\nBritish Museum, and that the difficulty of making a fairly complete\r\ncollection of such bodies must increase enormously as time goes on,\r\nowing to the absorption of the specimens by public museums, Mr.\r\nMaskelyne immediately after his appointment tried to fill up the gaps.\r\nIn the first place, the meteorite collections of Dr. A. Krantz, Mr. R.\r\nP. Greg, and Mr. R. Campbell, and many meteorites belonging to Mr. W.\r\nNevill and Prof. C. U. Shepard, were acquired by purchase in 1861-2.\r\nDuring the interval (1857-63), the whole or parts of many\r\nmeteorites were presented to the Museum:--\r\n\r\nFrom Great Britain.--_Perth:_ by Mr. W. Nevill.\r\n\r\nFrom Russia.--_Tula:_ by Dr. J. Auerbach of Moscow.\r\n\r\nFrom India.--_Bustee_, _Dhurmsala_, _Durala_ and _Shalka:_ by\r\n             the Secretary of State for India.\r\n\r\n             _Assam_, _Butsura_, _Futtehpur_, _Khiragurh_, _Manegaum_,\r\n             _Mhow_, _Moradabad_, _Segowlie_ and _Umballa:_ by the\r\n             Asiatic Society of Bengal.\r\n\r\n             _Nellore_ and _Parnallee:_ by Sir W. T. Denison, K.C.B.\r\n\r\n             _Kusiali_ and _Pegu:_ by Dr. Thos. Oldham, F.R.S.\r\n\r\n             _Kaee:_ by Sir Thos. Maclear, F.R.S.\r\n\r\n             _Dhurmsala:_ by Mr. G. Lennox Conyngham.\r\n\r\nFrom Australia.--The large _Cranbourne_ iron: by Mr. James Bruce.\r\n\r\nFrom South America.--_Vaca Muerta:_ by Mr. W. Taylour Thomson.\r\n\r\n                     _Imilac:_ by Mr. W. Bollaert.\r\n\r\n                     An _Atacama_ iron: by Mr. Lewis Joel.\r\n\r\nFrom North America.--_Tucson:_ by the Town Authorities of San Francisco.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the same interval, exchanges were made with the museums of\r\nParis, Vienna, Berlin, Copenhagen, Heidelberg, and Göttingen, through\r\nProfessors Daubrée, Haidinger, Rose, Hoff, Bunsen, and Wöhler,\r\nrespectively: and also with the following private collectors:--Dr.\r\nAbich of Dorpat, Dr. J. Auerbach of Moscow, Mr. R. P. Greg of\r\nManchester, Prof. C. U. Shepard of New Haven, U.S.A., and Dr. Sismonda\r\nof Turin.\r\n\r\nThe result was that by the end of 1863 the number of meteoric falls\r\nrepresented in the collection was 204, and thus had been almost trebled\r\nduring Mr. Maskelyne's first six years of office.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, although Mr. Maskelyne, with the help of a single assistant\r\n(Mr. Thomas Davies), was then rearranging the general collection of\r\nminerals according to a new system of classification, time was found\r\nfor a scientific examination of the meteorites thus being acquired.\r\nAt that time the Department was without a chemical laboratory, and\r\nnot even a blowpipe could be used, owing to the necessity of guarding\r\nagainst a possible destruction of the Museum by fire. Hence recourse\r\nwas had to the microscope, and as early as 1861, a microscope fitted\r\nwith a revolving graduated stage and an eye-piece goniometer was\r\nconstructed, under the Keeper's directions, for the examination of thin\r\nsections of meteorites with the aid of polarised light.\r\n\r\nWorking in this way, and with the simplest chemical tests, Mr.\r\nMaskelyne was the first to announce in 1862 the discovery in the\r\nBustee meteorite of a mineral, unknown in terrestrial mineralogy,\r\nto which he gave the name of Oldhamite, and in 1863, the more than\r\nprobable occurrence of Enstatite as an important meteoritic ingredient\r\n(Nellore). This method of determining the mineral constituents of a\r\nrock-section by means of the relation of the vibration-traces to known\r\ncrystallographic lines, thus first and of necessity employed for the\r\ndiscrimination of the minerals in meteorites, is now in general use in\r\nthe investigation, not only of meteoritic, but of terrestrial rocks.\r\nAbout the same time, from the Breitenbach meteorite were extracted\r\ncrystals of Bronzite, which yielded the first crystallographic elements\r\nobtained for that mineral: the measurements were made and published by\r\nDr. Viktor von Lang, then assistant in the Department (1862-4) and now\r\nProfessor of Physics at Vienna.\r\n\r\nThe microscope was further applied to the mechanical separation of\r\nthe different mineral ingredients of a meteorite: and by picking out\r\nin this toilsome manner the different mineral ingredients from the\r\ncrumbled material of the Bustee aerolite, and from the residue of the\r\nBreitenbach siderolite left after the iron had been removed by mercuric\r\nchloride, the several silicates contained in these meteorites were\r\nisolated for future analysis. From the particles of colourless mineral\r\nthus obtained from the Breitenbach meteorite, one kind was selected\r\nin 1867, of which the crystals presented a zone of orthosymmetry\r\ncontaining two optic axes, and yielded two similar cleavages in a zone\r\nperpendicular to the former. This ingredient was afterwards (1869)\r\nannounced to consist wholly of silica, a substance which, before the\r\nisolation of this mineral, was only known to occur as quartz, when\r\nin crystals, and these belong to the hexagonal system: to the new\r\nmineral Mr. Maskelyne later assigned the name of Asmanite. In 1868\r\nwas published by Vom Rath the discovery of a species of terrestrial\r\nsilica, the crystals of which were regarded as belonging to the\r\nhexagonal system, though their angular elements were distinct from\r\nthose of quartz: this mineral, named by him Tridymite, has since been\r\nfound (1878) to present optical and other characters inconsistent with\r\ntrue hexagonal symmetry, and is probably identical in its specific\r\ncharacters with the meteoritic asmanite.\r\n\r\nFurther, another mineral occurring as minute gold-yellow octahedra in\r\nthe Bustee meteorite was recognised as new to mineralogy, and termed\r\nOsbornite.\r\n\r\nIt was not till 1867, when a laboratory was fitted up outside the\r\nMuseum precincts, that it became possible to make a complete chemical\r\nexamination of these materials, which had been gradually prepared and\r\ncarefully picked for analysis. In that year the late Dr. Walter Flight\r\nwas appointed to assist in the laboratory-work of the Department,\r\nand afterwards gave valuable help in the chemical analysis of the\r\nabove materials; the results were quite confirmatory of those already\r\nobtained by aid of the microscope and the simple tests.\r\n\r\nSince the great increase made during the first six years of Prof.\r\nMaskelyne's Keepership, the Collection has continued to grow, though\r\nnecessarily at a less rapid rate.\r\n\r\nOf the specimens added after 1863, the following have been presented:--\r\n\r\n   1864-7: _Manbhoom_, _Muddoor_ and _Pokhra:_ by Dr. Thos.

Till the beginning of the nineteenth century, the fall of stones\r\nfrom the sky was an event, the actuality of which neither men of\r\nscience nor people in general could be brought to credit. Yet such\r\nfalls have been recorded from the earliest times, and the records\r\nhave occasionally been received as authentic by a whole nation. In\r\nmost cases, however, the witnesses of such an event have been treated\r\nwith the disrespect usually shown to reporters of the extraordinary,\r\nand have been laughed at for their supposed delusions: this is less\r\nto be wondered at when we remember that the witnesses of the arrival\r\nof a stone from the sky have usually been few in number, unaccustomed\r\nto exact observation, frightened both by what they saw and by what\r\nthey heard, and have had a common tendency towards exaggeration and\r\nsuperstition.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ancient records.]\r\n\r\n2. De Guignes in his Travels states that, according to old Chinese\r\nmanuscripts, falls of stones have again and again been observed in\r\nChina; the earliest mentioned is one which happened about 644 B.C.\r\n\r\nA stone, famous through long ages,[1] fell in Phrygia and was\r\npreserved there for many generations. About 204 B.C. it was demanded\r\nfrom King Attalus and taken with great ceremony to Rome. It is\r\ndescribed as \"a black stone, in the figure of a cone, circular below\r\nand ending in an apex above.\"\r\n\r\nIn his History of Rome, Livy tells of a shower of stones on the Alban\r\nMount, about 652 B.C., which so impressed the Senate that a nine days'\r\nsolemn festival was decreed; as the shower lasted for two days, it was\r\ndoubtless the result of volcanic action; other instances of the \"rain\r\nof stones\" in Italy, mentioned by the same author, had possibly a\r\nsimilar origin.\r\n\r\nPlutarch relates the fall of a stone in Thrace about 470 B.C., during\r\nthe time of Pindar, and according to Pliny, the stone was still\r\npreserved in his day, 500 years afterwards. The latter records two\r\nother falls, one in Asia Minor, the other in Macedonia.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Worship of meteoric stones.]\r\n\r\n3. These falls from the sky, when credited at all, have been deemed\r\nprodigies or miracles, and the stones have been regarded as objects for\r\nreverence and worship. It has even been conjectured that the worship\r\nof such stones was the earliest form of idolatry. The Phrygian stone,\r\nmentioned above, was worshipped at Pessinus by the Phrygians and\r\nPh[oe]nicians as Cybele, \"the mother of the gods,\" and its transference\r\nto Rome followed the announcement by an oracle that possession of the\r\nstone would secure to the State a continual increase of prosperity.\r\nSimilarly, the Diana of the Ephesians, \"which fell down from Jupiter,\"\r\nand the image of Venus at Cyprus, appear to have been, not statues,\r\nbut conical or pyramidal stones. A stone, of which the history goes\r\nback far beyond the seventh century, is still revered by the Moslems as\r\none of their holiest relics, and is preserved at Mecca built into the\r\nnortheastern corner of the Kaaba. The late Paul Partsch,[2] for many\r\nyears Keeper of Minerals in the Imperial Museum of Vienna, considered\r\nthat the meteoric origin of the Kaaba stone was sufficiently proved\r\nby descriptions which had been submitted to him. A stone which fell\r\nin Japan in the year 1741, [Sidenote: Pane 4c.] and was presented to\r\nthe British Museum in 1883, had long been made an annual offering in\r\na temple of Ogi at one of the Japanese religious festivals. It may\r\nbe added that a stone which lately fell in India[3] was decked with\r\nflowers, daily anointed with ghee (clarified butter), and subjected to\r\nfrequent ceremonial worship and coatings of sandal-wood powder. The\r\nstone was placed on a terrace constructed for it at the place where it\r\nstruck the ground, and a subscription was made for the erection of a\r\nshrine.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The oldest undoubted meteoric stone still preserved.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Pane 4c.]\r\n\r\n4. The oldest undoubted sky-stone still preserved is that which was\r\nlong suspended by a chain from the vault of the choir of the parish\r\nchurch of Ensisheim in Elsass, and is now kept in the Rathhaus of that\r\ntown. The following is a translated extract from a document which was\r\npreserved in the church:--\r\n\r\n   \"On the 16th of November, 1492, a singular miracle happened:\r\n   for between 11 and 12 in the forenoon, with a loud crash of\r\n   thunder and a prolonged noise heard afar off, there fell in\r\n   the town of Ensisheim a stone weighing 260 pounds. It was seen\r\n   by a child to strike the ground in a field near the canton\r\n   called Gisgaud, where it made a hole more than five feet deep.\r\n   It was taken to the church as being a miraculous object. The\r\n   noise was heard so distinctly at Lucerne, Villing, and many\r\n   other places, that in each of them it was thought that some\r\n   houses had fallen. King Maximilian, who was then at Ensisheim,\r\n   had the stone carried to the castle: after breaking off two\r\n   pieces, one for the Duke Sigismund of Austria and the other\r\n   for himself, he forbade further damage, and ordered the stone\r\n   to be suspended in the parish church.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Scientific men begin to investigate the reports.]\r\n\r\n5. Three French Academicians, one of whom was the afterwards renowned\r\nchemist Lavoisier, presented to the Academy in 1772 a report on the\r\nanalysis of a stone said to have been seen to fall at Lucé on September\r\n13, 1768. [Sidenote: Pane 4c.] As the identity of lightning with\r\nthe electric spark had been recently established by Franklin, they\r\nwere in advance convinced that \"thunder-stones\" existed only in the\r\nimagination; and never dreaming of the existence of a \"sky-stone\" which\r\nhad no relation to a \"thunder-stone,\" they somewhat easily assured\r\nboth themselves and the Academy that there was nothing unusual in the\r\nmineralogical characters of the Lucé specimen, their verdict being that\r\nthe stone was an ordinary one which had been struck and altered by\r\nlightning.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Chladni argues that the bodies come from outer space.]\r\n\r\n6. In 1794 the German philosopher Chladni, famed for his researches\r\ninto the laws of sound, brought together numerous accounts of the fall\r\nof bodies from the sky, and called the attention of the scientific\r\nworld to the fact that several masses of iron, of which he specially\r\nconsiders two, had in all probability come from outer space to this\r\nplanet.[4]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Pallas iron.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Pane 4c.]\r\n\r\nOne of them is the mass still known as the Pallas or Krasnojarsk\r\niron.[5] This irregular mass, weighing about 1500 lbs., of which the\r\ngreater part is in the Museum at St. Petersburg, was met with at\r\nKrasnojarsk by the traveller Pallas in the year 1772, and had been\r\nfound in 1749 by a Cossack on the surface of the highest part of a\r\nlofty mountain between Krasnojarsk and Abakansk in Siberia, in the\r\nmidst of a schistose district: it was regarded by the Tartars as a\r\n\"holy thing fallen from heaven.\" The interior is composed of a ductile\r\niron, which, though brittle at a high temperature, can be forged either\r\ncold or at a moderate heat; its large sponge-like pores are filled with\r\nan amber-coloured olivine; the texture is uniform, and the olivine\r\nequally distributed; a vitreous varnish had preserved it from rust.\r\nThe fragment in the case, weighing about 7 lbs., was presented to the\r\nTrustees in 1776 by the Academy of Sciences of St. Petersburg.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Otumpa iron.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Separate stand.]\r\n\r\nA second specimen referred to is that which in 1783 Don Michael Rubin\r\nde Celis was sent by the Viceroy of Rio de la Plata to investigate;[6]\r\nit had been found by Indians, searching for honey and wax, and trusting\r\nto rain for drink, projecting about a foot above the ground near a\r\nplace called Otumpa, in the Gran Chaco Gualamba, South America, and was\r\nat first thought to be the outcrop of an iron vein. Don Rubin de Celis\r\nestimated the weight of this mass of malleable iron at thirty thousand\r\npounds, and reported that for a hundred leagues around there were\r\nneither iron mines nor mountains nor even the smallest stones, and that\r\nowing to the absence of water, there was not a single fixed habitation\r\nin the country. There were several smaller masses at the locality;\r\none of them, weighing 1400 lbs., is shown on a separate stand in the\r\nPavilion: according to Sir Woodbine Parish, who presented it to the\r\nMuseum in 1826, it had been removed to Buenos Ayres at the beginning\r\nof the struggle for Independence; it was a complimentary gift to Sir\r\nWoodbine on the occasion of his being sent by Canning to acknowledge\r\nthe Independence of the State. A slice of this iron is shown in case 4c.\r\n[Sidenote: Pane 4c.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Chladni's arguments.]\r\n\r\n7. Chladni argued that these masses could not have been formed in\r\nthe wet way, for they had evidently been exposed to fire and slowly\r\ncooled: that the absence of scoriæ in the neighbourhood, the extremely\r\nhard and pitted crust, the ductility of the iron, and, in the case of\r\nthe Siberian mass, the regular distribution of the pores and olivine,\r\nprecluded the idea that they could have been formed where found,\r\nwhether by man, electricity, or an accidental conflagration: he was\r\ndriven to conclude that they had been formed elsewhere, and projected\r\nthence to the places where they were discovered; and as no volcanoes\r\nhad been known to eject masses of iron, and as, moreover, no volcanoes\r\nare met with in those regions, he held that the specimens referred to\r\nmust have actually fallen from the sky. Further, he sought to show that\r\nthe flight of a heavy body through the sky is the direct cause of the\r\nluminous phenomenon known as a fire-ball.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The fall of stones at Siena, in Tuscany.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Pane 4c.]\r\n\r\n8. About seven o'clock on the evening of June 16, 1794, as if to direct\r\nattention to Chladni's just published theory, there fell a shower of\r\nstones at Siena, in Tuscany.\r\n\r\nThe event is described in the following letter, dated Siena, July 12,\r\n1794, from the Earl of Bristol to Sir William Hamilton, K.B., F.R.S.,\r\nat that time British Envoy-Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary at the\r\nCourt of Naples:--[7]\r\n\r\n   \"In the midst of a most violent thunderstorm, about a dozen\r\n   stones of various weights and dimensions fell at the feet of\r\n   different persons, men, women and children. The stones are of\r\n   a quality not found in any part of the Siennese territory;\r\n   they fell about 18 hours after the enormous eruption of Mount\r\n   Vesuvius: which circumstance leaves a choice of difficulties\r\n   in the solution of this extraordinary phenomenon. Either these\r\n   stones have been generated in this igneous mass of clouds which\r\n   produced such unusual thunder, or, which is equally incredible,\r\n   they were thrown from Vesuvius, at a distance of at least 250\r\n   miles: judge, then, of its parabola. The philosophers here\r\n   incline to the first solution. I wish much, Sir, to know your\r\n   sentiments. My first objection was to the fact itself, but of\r\n   this there are so many eyewitnesses, it seems impossible to\r\n   withstand their evidence.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The fall of a stone near Wold Cottage, Yorkshire.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Pane 4b.]\r\n\r\n9. Soon afterwards there fell a stone in England itself. About three\r\no'clock in the afternoon of December 13, 1795, a labourer working\r\nnear Wold Cottage, a few miles from Scarborough, in Yorkshire,[8]\r\nwas terrified to see a stone fall about ten yards from where he was\r\nstanding. The stone, weighing 56 lbs., was found to have gone through\r\n12 inches of soil and 6 inches of solid chalk rock. No thunder,\r\nlightning, or luminous meteor accompanied the fall; but in the adjacent\r\nvillages there was heard an explosion likened by the inhabitants to\r\nthe firing of guns at sea, while in two of them the sounds were so\r\ndistinct of something singular passing through the air towards Wold\r\nCottage, that five or six people went to see if anything extraordinary\r\nhad happened to the house or grounds. No stone presenting the same\r\ncharacters was known in the district. The stone is preserved in the\r\nMuseum Collection.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Terrestrial origin still sought for.]\r\n\r\n10. It seemed to be now impossible for any one to doubt the fall of\r\nstones from the sky, but the reluctance of scientific men to grant an\r\nextra-terrestrial origin to them is shown by the theories referred\r\nto in the above letter to Sir William Hamilton, and is rendered even\r\nmore evident by the theory proposed in 1796 by Edward King, who\r\nsuggested that the stones had their origin in the condensation of a\r\ncloud of ashes, mixed with pyritical dust and numerous particles of\r\niron, coming from some volcano. As the stones fell at Siena out of a\r\ncloud coming from the North, while Vesuvius is really to the South,\r\nhe gravely suggested that in this case the cloud had been blown from\r\nthe South past Siena, and had then before its condensation into stone\r\nbeen brought back by a change of wind. As to the fall of a stone near\r\nWold Cottage, he was not prepared either to believe or disbelieve the\r\nwitnesses until the matter had been more closely examined; but in\r\ncase the statements should prove worthy of credit, he points out the\r\npossibility of the necessary dust-cloud having come from Mount Hecla in\r\nIceland.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The fall of stones near Benares, in India.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Pane 4c.]\r\n\r\n11. Later came a well-authenticated account of a more wonderful event\r\nstill. At 8 o'clock on the evening of December 19, 1798, many stones\r\nfell at Krakhut, 14 miles from Benares, in India; the sky was perfectly\r\nserene, not a cloud had been seen since December 11, and none was\r\nseen for many days after. According to the observations of several\r\nEuropeans, as well as natives, in different parts of the country, the\r\nfall of the stones was preceded by the appearance of a _ball of fire_,\r\nwhich lasted for only a few instants, and was followed by an explosion\r\nresembling thunder.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Examination of stones by Howard.]\r\n\r\n12. Fragments of the stones of Siena, Wold Cottage, and Krakhut, as\r\nalso of a stone said to have fallen on July 3, 1753, at Tabor, in\r\nBohemia, came into the hands of Edward Howard, and the comparative\r\nresults of a chemical and mineralogical investigation (the latter by\r\nthe Count de Bournon) of the stones from the above four places are\r\ngiven in a paper read before the Royal Society of London, on February\r\n25, 1802. Howard concludes as follows:--\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Pane 4c.]\r\n\r\n   \"The mineralogical descriptions of the Lucé stone by the\r\n   French Academicians, of the Ensisheim stone by M. Barthold,\r\n   and of stones from the above four places (Siena, Wold Cottage,\r\n   Krakhut and Tabor) by the Count de Bournon, all exhibit a\r\n   striking conformity of character common to each of them, and\r\n   I doubt not but the similarity of component parts, especially\r\n   of the malleable alloy, together with the near approach of the\r\n   constituent proportions of the earth contained in each of the\r\n   four stones, will establish very strong evidence in favour\r\n   of the assertion that they have fallen on our globe. They\r\n   have been found at places very remote from each other, and at\r\n   periods also sufficiently distant. The mineralogists who have\r\n   examined them agree that they have no resemblance to mineral\r\n   substances properly so called, nor have they been described by\r\n   mineralogical authors.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Could projectiles reach the earth from the moon?]\r\n\r\n13. This paper aroused much interest in the scientific world, and,\r\nthough Chladni's view that such stones come from outer space was still\r\nnot generally accepted in France, it was there deemed more worthy of\r\nconsideration after Poisson[9] (following Laplace) had shown that a\r\nbody shot from the moon in the direction of the earth, with an initial\r\nvelocity of 7592 feet a second, would not fall back upon the moon, but\r\nwould actually, after a journey of sixty-four hours, reach the earth,\r\nupon which, neglecting the resistance of the air, it would fall with a\r\nvelocity of about 31,508 feet a second.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The fall of stones at L'Aigle, in France.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Pane 4c.]\r\n\r\n14. Whilst the minds of the scientific men of France were in this\r\nunsettled condition, there came a report that still another shower\r\nof stones had fallen, this time in their own country, and within\r\neasy reach of Paris. To settle the matter finally, if possible, the\r\nphysicist Biot, Member of the French Academy, was directed by the\r\nMinister of the Interior to inquire into the event upon the spot. After\r\na careful examination of the stones and a comparison of the statements\r\nof the villagers, Biot[10] was convinced that--\r\n\r\n   1. On Tuesday, April 26, 1803, about 1 P.M., there was a noise as\r\n   of a violent _explosion_ in the neighbourhood of L'Aigle, in the\r\n   department of Orne, followed by a rolling sound which lasted for\r\n   five or six minutes: the noise was heard for a distance of 75 miles\r\n   round.\r\n\r\n   2. Some moments before the explosion at L'Aigle, a _fire-ball_ in\r\n   quick motion was seen from several of the adjoining towns, though\r\n   not from L'Aigle itself.\r\n\r\n   3. There was absolutely no doubt that on the same day _many stones\r\n   fell_ in the neighbourhood of L'Aigle.\r\n\r\nBiot estimated the number of the stones at two or three thousand; they\r\nfell within an ellipse of which the larger axis was 6·2 miles, and the\r\nsmaller 2·5 miles; and this inequality might indicate not a single\r\nexplosion but a series of them. With the exception of a few little\r\nclouds of ordinary character, the sky was quite clear.\r\n\r\nThe exhaustive report of Biot, and the completeness of his proofs,\r\ncompelled the whole of the scientific world to recognise the fall of\r\nstones on the earth from outer space as an undoubted fact.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The times and places of fall are independent of terrestrial\r\ncircumstances.]\r\n\r\n15. Since that date many falls have been observed, and the attendant\r\nphenomena have been carefully investigated. These observations teach\r\nus that _meteorites_, as they are now called, fall at all times of\r\nthe day and night, and at all seasons of the year, while they favour\r\nno particular latitudes: also they are found to be quite independent\r\nof the weather, and in many cases have fallen when the sky has been\r\nperfectly clear; even where stones have fallen in what has been called\r\na thunder-storm, we may reasonably suppose that in most cases the\r\nluminous phenomenon has been mistaken for a variety of lightning, and\r\nthe loud noise for thunder.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Velocity of meteorites.]\r\n\r\n16. From observations of the path and the time of flight of the\r\nluminous meteor, it is calculated that meteorites enter the earth's\r\natmosphere with absolute velocities ranging from 10 to 45 miles a\r\nsecond: the velocity actually observed is that relative to a person\r\nat rest on the earth's surface; for the determination of the absolute\r\nvelocity of the meteorite, the motion of the observer with the earth\r\n(about 18 miles a second) must be allowed for. Let us attempt to follow\r\nthe course of a small compact body moving at such a rate. So long as\r\nthe body is traversing \"empty space,\" the only heat it receives is that\r\nsent direct from the sun and stars; in general, the meteorite will\r\nthus be probably very cold, and, owing to its small size and want of\r\nluminosity, it will be invisible to an observer on the earth's surface.\r\nAfter the meteorite enters the earth's atmosphere a very speedy change\r\nmust take place. [Sidenote: The resistance of the air.] Assuming\r\nthe law of resistance of the air for a planetary velocity to be the\r\nsame as that deduced from experiments with artillery, the astronomer\r\nSchiaparelli[11] has shown that if a ball of 8 inches diameter and\r\n32-1/3 lbs. weight enter the atmosphere with a velocity of 44-3/4 miles\r\na second, its velocity on arriving at a point where the barometric\r\npressure is still only 1/760th of that at the earth's surface will have\r\nbeen already reduced to 3-1/6 miles a second. From this it is clear\r\nthat the speed of the meteorite after the whole of the atmosphere has\r\nbeen traversed will be extremely small, and comparable with that of\r\nan ordinary falling body. From experiments made by Professor A. S.\r\nHerschel, it has been calculated that the velocity of the meteorite\r\nwhich fell at Middlesbrough, in Yorkshire, on March 14, 1881, was, on\r\nstriking the ground, only 412 feet a second. From the depth of the\r\nhole (20 to 24 inches) made in stiff loam by the stone which fell at\r\nHvittis, in Finland, on October 21, 1901, it has been estimated by Mr.\r\nBorgström that the meteorite had a velocity of 584 feet a second when\r\nit reached the earth. He further calculates that the stone would have\r\nacquired virtually the same velocity if it had been merely allowed to\r\nfall, from a position of rest, under the action of gravity, through an\r\ninfinite atmosphere having the same density as at the earth's surface.\r\nIn the case of the Hessle fall, several stones fell on the ice, which\r\nwas only a few inches thick, and rebounded without either breaking the\r\nice or being broken themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Transformation of the energy.]\r\n\r\n17. Further, Schiaparelli pointed out that, in the case imagined by\r\nhim, the energy already converted into heat would be sufficient to\r\nraise 198,400 pounds of water from freezing point to boiling point\r\nunder the ordinary barometric pressure. The greater part of this heat\r\nis, no doubt, carried off by the air through which the meteorite\r\npasses; but still the wonder is, not that a meteorite is small on\r\nreaching the earth's surface, but that any of it is left to \"tell the\r\ntale.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The cloud, ball of fire and trail.]\r\n\r\nThis sudden generation of heat will cause fusion, and even luminosity,\r\nof the outer material of the meteorite, and in some cases a combustion\r\nof some of its constituents: the products of the thermal and mechanical\r\naction sufficiently account for the _cloud_ from which the meteorite is\r\ngenerally seen to emerge as a ball of fire, and also for the visible\r\ntrail often left behind. The ball of fire has often an apparent\r\ndiameter larger even than that of the moon, and is sometimes too bright\r\nfor the eye to gaze upon.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The meteorite is only luminous in the first part of its\r\nflight through the air.]\r\n\r\n18. Owing to the quick reduction of speed, the luminosity will be\r\na feature of the higher, not the lower, part of the course. The\r\nOrgueil meteorite of May 14, 1864, was so high when luminous that,\r\nnotwithstanding its almost easterly motion, it was seen over a space of\r\ncountry ranging from the Pyrenees to the north of Paris, a distance of\r\nmore than 300 miles.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The time of flight through the air is very brief.]\r\n\r\n19. Next we may remark that the time of flight in the earth's\r\natmosphere will be very short, and reckoned only by seconds. Even when\r\nthe meteorite is wholly metallic, if we may judge from the time one end\r\nof a poker may be held in the hand whilst the other end is in the fire,\r\nthe heat will not have had time to get far below the surface before the\r\nbody will have reached the ground. [Sidenote: Pane 4d.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The crust.]\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, meteorites are almost invariably found to be\r\ncovered with a _crust_ or varnish, such as would be caused by strong\r\nheating, and its thinness shows the slight depth to which the heat has\r\nhad time to penetrate; in the case of the stones, the greater part\r\nof the suddenly heated superficial material must chip off and be left\r\nbehind at all parts of the track of the meteor. The aspect of the crust\r\nvaries according to the mineral constitution of the meteorites: it is\r\ngenerally black, and in most cases dull, as in High Possil, Zsadány and\r\nOrgueil, [Sidenote: Pane 4d.] but sometimes shiny, as in Stannern, or\r\npartly dull and partly shiny, as in Dyalpur; rarely, it is of a dark\r\ngrey colour, as in Mezö-Madaras and some of the stones which fell in\r\nthe neighbourhood of Mocs. In the case of the Pultusk meteorite of\r\nJanuary 30, 1868, several thousands of stones, [Sidenote: Panes 4efg.]\r\nvarying from the size of a man's head to that of a small nut, were\r\npicked up, each covered with a crust: fifty-six of the stones of this\r\nfall are shown in the case.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The crust.]\r\n\r\n20. The crust is not of equal thickness at every point; for, the\r\nform of the meteorite being a result of oft-repeated fracture, the\r\nconstantly changing surface must be very irregular, and its different\r\nparts must be heated to different temperatures and be exposed to\r\ndifferent amounts of mechanical action. Sometimes, owing to the motion\r\nof the meteorite through the air, the crust is so marked as to indicate\r\nthe position of the meteorite in regard to its line of motion at a\r\ncertain part of its course; and this relation is rendered more clear\r\nin some cases by evidence that melted material has been driven to the\r\nback of the moving mass. The Nedagolla iron and the Goalpara stone\r\nillustrate this peculiarity. [Sidenote: Pane 4h.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The pittings.]\r\n\r\n21. Further, the surface of a meteorite is generally covered with\r\n_pittings_, which have been compared in form to thumb-marks: stones\r\nfrom the Supuhee, Futtehpur, [Sidenote: Pane 4h.] and Knyahinya falls\r\npresent good examples of this character. It is remarkable that pittings\r\nbearing a close resemblance to those of meteorites have been observed\r\non the large partially burned grains of gunpowder, which have been\r\n[Sidenote: Pane 4h.] picked up near the muzzle after the firing of the\r\n35-ton and 80-ton guns at Woolwich. The pitting of the gunpowder grains\r\nis attributed to unequal combustion, but that of meteorites seems\r\nto be due not so much to inequality of combustibility as to that of\r\nconductivity, fusibility and frangibility of the matter at the surface.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fragmentary form of meteorites.]\r\n\r\n22. As picked up, complete and covered with crust, meteorites are not\r\nspherical, nor have they any definite shape: in fact, they are always\r\nirregular angular fragments, such as would be obtained on breaking up a\r\nrock presenting no regularity of structure.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Pane 4h.]\r\n\r\nIn the case of the Butsura fall of May 12, 1861,[12] fragments of the\r\nstone were picked up three or four miles apart, and, wonderful to say,\r\nit was possible to reconstruct with much certainty the portion of the\r\nmeteorite to which they once belonged: a model of the reconstructed\r\nportion is shown in the case. Two of the fragments, [Sidenote: Pane 4a.]\r\nin other respects fitting perfectly together, are even on the faces\r\nof the junction now coated with a black crust, showing that one\r\ndisruption took place when the meteorite had a high velocity; two other\r\nfragments found some miles apart fitted perfectly, and were neither\r\nof them incrusted at the surface of fracture, thus indicating another\r\ndisruption at a time when the velocity of the meteorite had been so far\r\nreduced that the material of the new faces was not blackened through\r\nthe generation of heat. Sometimes, as in the case of the meteorite of\r\nOrgueil, the fragments reach the ground before the detonation is heard,\r\nproving that the fracture has taken place at a part of the course where\r\nthe velocity of the meteorite was considerably greater than that of the\r\nsound-vibrations (1100 feet a second).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The detonations.]\r\n\r\n23. The sudden condensation of air in front of the meteorite, the\r\nconsequent generation of heat and expansion of the outer shell, have\r\nbeen held to account not only for the _break-up_ of the meteorite\r\ninto fragments, but partly also for the _crash like that of thunder_\r\nwhich is a usual accompaniment of the fall. Others have referred this\r\nnoise solely to the sudden rush of air into the space traversed by\r\nthe meteorite in the early part of the course. It has, however, now\r\nbeen discovered that the mere flight of a projectile through the air\r\nwith a velocity exceeding that of sound (1100 feet a second) is itself\r\nsufficient to cause a loud detonation; neither explosion, like that\r\nof a bomb-shell, nor simple fracture of the meteorite by reason of\r\npressure or sudden heat, is a necessary preliminary to the production\r\nof the loud noise. It is found, in fact, that when a projectile is\r\nfired with high initial velocity, say 2350 feet a second, an observer\r\nnear the path of the projectile begins to distinguish two detonations\r\nas soon as his distance from the cannon reaches 500 feet; the first of\r\nthem, a sharp one, appears to come from that part of the projectile's\r\npath which is nearest to the observer, and travels with the velocity\r\nof the projectile; the later and duller one appears to come from\r\nthe cannon itself, and travels with the velocity of sound. If the\r\nprojectile is intercepted near the cannon, only a single detonation is\r\nheard by an observer in the same position as before, and it travels\r\nat the rate of 1100 feet a second. If the initial velocity of the\r\nprojectile is less than that of sound, only a single detonation is\r\nheard, and it starts from the cannon.\r\n\r\nThe rolling sound, which follows the detonation of a meteorite, is due,\r\nas in the case of thunder, to echoes from the ground and the clouds.\r\n\r\nThe detonations due to the different members of a swarm of meteorites\r\nwill combine to form a single detonation unless they are separated by\r\nperceptible intervals of time.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The sounds heard after the loud detonations.]\r\n\r\n24. After the detonation, sounds are generally heard which have been\r\nvariously likened to the flapping of the wings of wild geese, the\r\nbellowing of oxen, Turkish music, the roaring of a fire in a chimney,\r\nthe noise of a carriage on the pavement, and the tearing of calico:\r\nthese sounds are probably due to the whirling and oscillation of the\r\nfragments while traversing the air, with small velocity, near the\r\nobservers, and correspond to the hiss or hum observed in the case of a\r\nprojectile travelling with a velocity less than that of sound.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The chemical elements found in meteorites.]\r\n\r\n25. As to the _kinds of elementary matter_[13] of which meteorites are\r\ncomposed, about one-third, and those the most common, of the elements\r\nat present recognised as constituents of the earth's crust have been\r\nmet with: no new elementary body has been discovered.\r\n\r\nThe most frequent or plentiful in their occurrence are:--\r\n\r\n   Aluminium\r\n   Calcium\r\n   Carbon\r\n   Iron\r\n   Magnesium\r\n   Nickel\r\n   Oxygen\r\n   Phosphorus\r\n   Silicon\r\n   Sulphur:\r\n\r\nwhile, less frequently or in smaller quantities, are found:\r\n\r\n   Antimony\r\n   Arsenic\r\n   Chlorine\r\n   Chromium\r\n   Cobalt\r\n   Copper\r\n   Hydrogen\r\n   Lithium\r\n   Manganese\r\n   Nitrogen\r\n   Potassium\r\n   Sodium\r\n   Strontium\r\n   Tin\r\n   Titanium\r\n   Vanadium.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Elements present only in minute quantity.]\r\n\r\n26. In addition to the above, the existence of minute traces of several\r\nother elements has been announced; of these special mention may be made\r\nof gallium, gold, iridium, lead, platinum and silver.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Both simple and combined.]\r\n\r\n27. Most of the above elements are present in the combined state;\r\nthe iron occurring chiefly in combination with nickel, and the\r\nphosphorus almost always combined with both nickel and iron. Some of\r\nthem are found also in their elementary condition: perhaps hydrogen\r\nand nitrogen; carbon, both as indistinctly crystallised diamond\r\nand as graphitic carbon, the latter being generally amorphous, but\r\noccasionally in cubic crystals (cliftonite); free phosphorus has been\r\nfound in Saline Township; free sulphur has been observed in one of the\r\ncarbonaceous meteorites, but may have been separated from the unstable\r\nsulphides since the entry into our atmosphere.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Some of the constituents are new to mineralogy.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Pane 4k.]\r\n\r\n28. Of the constituents of meteorites, the following are by many\r\nmineralogists regarded as being at present unrepresented among the\r\nterrestrial minerals:--\r\n\r\n   _Cliftonite_, a cubic form of graphitic carbon,\r\n   _Phosphorus_,\r\n   _Various alloys of nickel and iron_,\r\n   _Moissanite_, silicide of carbon,\r\n   _Cohenite_, carbide of iron and nickel; corresponding\r\n   to Cementite, carbide of iron, found in artificial iron,\r\n   _Schreibersite_, phosphide of iron and nickel,\r\n   _Troilite_, proto-sulphide of iron,\r\n   _Oldhamite_, sulphide of calcium,\r\n   _Osbornite_, oxy-sulphide of calcium and titanium or zirconium,\r\n   _Daubréelite_, sulphide of iron and chromium,\r\n   _Lawrencite_, protochloride of iron,\r\n   _Asmanite_, a species of silica,\r\n   _Maskelynite_, a singly refracting mineral with the composition\r\n   of labradorite.\r\n   _Weinbergerite_, silicate intermediate in\r\n   chemical composition between pyroxene and nepheline.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Nature of troilite, asmanite and maskelynite.]\r\n\r\nOf the above, _Troilite_ is perhaps identical with some varieties of\r\nterrestrial pyrrhotite: _Asmanite_, the form of silica obtained in 1867\r\nby Prof. Maskelyne from the Breitenbach meteorite, was announced by him\r\nin 1869 to be optically biaxal, and thus to belong to a crystalline\r\nsystem different from the hexagonal to which both tridymite, then\r\njust announced by Vom Rath, and quartz had been assigned. Later\r\ninvestigations of tridymite have shown that its optical characters\r\nand crystalline form are inconsistent with the hexagonal system of\r\ncrystallisation, and it is not impossible that asmanite and tridymite\r\nmay be specifically identical. It has been found that tridymite becomes\r\noptically uniaxal at a moderate temperature, and its general characters\r\nappear to be essentially identical with those of asmanite. According\r\nto one view, _Maskelynite_ is the result of fusion of a plagioclastic\r\nfelspar; according to another, it is an independent species chemically\r\nrelated to leucite.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Compounds identical with terrestrial minerals.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Pane 4k.]\r\n\r\n29. Other compounds are present, corresponding to the following\r\nterrestrial minerals:--\r\n\r\n   Olivine and forsterite,\r\n   Enstatite and bronzite,\r\n   Diopside and augite,\r\n   Anorthite, labradorite and oligoclase,\r\n   Leucite,\r\n   Magnetite and chromite,\r\n   Pyrites,\r\n   Pyrrhotite,\r\n   Breunnerite.\r\n\r\nFurther, from one of the Lancé stones, chloride of sodium, and from the\r\ncarbonaceous meteorites, sulphates of sodium, calcium and magnesium,\r\nhave been extracted by means of water.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above, there are several compounds or mixtures of\r\nwhich the nature has not yet been satisfactorily ascertained.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The rarity of quartz.]\r\n\r\n30. Quartz, the most common of terrestrial minerals, is absent from the\r\nstony meteorites; but in the undissolved residue of the Toluca iron\r\nmicroscopic crystals have been found, some of which have important\r\ncharacters identical with those of quartz, while others resemble\r\nzircon. As mentioned above, free silica is present in the Breitenbach\r\nmeteorite as asmanite.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The conditions under which these compounds can have been\r\nformed.]\r\n\r\n31. As to the _conditions_[14] under which such compounds can have been\r\nformed, we may assert that they must have been very different from\r\nthose which at present obtain near the earth's surface: in fact, it is\r\nimpossible to imagine that phosphorus, the metallic nickel-iron and\r\nthe unstable sulphides can either have been formed, or have remained\r\nunaltered, under circumstances in which water and atmospheric air have\r\nplayed any prominent part. Still, what little we do know of the inner\r\npart of our globe does not shut out the possibility of the existence\r\nof similar elementary and compound bodies at great depths below the\r\nsurface. Daubrée,[15] after experiment, inclines to the belief that the\r\niron is due, in many cases at least, to reduction from an olivine rich\r\nin diferrous silicates, and this view perhaps acquires some additional\r\nprobability from the fact that hydrogen and carbonic oxide are given\r\noff when meteoric iron is heated: the existence, however, of such\r\nsiderolites as that of Krasnojarsk, which is rich both in metallic iron\r\nand in orthosilicate of iron and magnesium (olivine), and yet presents\r\nno traces of the intermediate metasilicate of iron and magnesium\r\n(bronzite), offers a weighty objection to the general application of\r\nthis view.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Classification.]\r\n\r\n32. Meteorites may be conveniently arranged in three classes, which\r\npass more or less gradually into each other: the first includes all\r\nthose which consist mainly of iron, and have, therefore, been called\r\nby Prof. Maskelyne aero-siderites (_aer_, air, and _sideros_, iron),\r\nor, more shortly, _Siderites;_ the second is formed by those which are\r\ncomposed chiefly of iron and stone, both in large proportion, and are\r\ncalled aero-siderolites, or, shortly, _Siderolites;_ while those of\r\nthe third class, being almost wholly of stone, are called _Aerolites_\r\n(_aer_, air, and _lithos_, stone).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The siderites.]\r\n\r\n33. In the Siderites the iron generally varies from 80 to 95 per\r\ncent., and the nickel from 6 to 10 per cent.; in the Santa Catharina\r\nsiderite (of which the meteoric origin is somewhat doubtful) 34, and\r\nin that of Oktibbeha County 60, per cent. of nickel have been found:\r\nthe nickel is alloyed with the iron, and several of the alloys have\r\nbeen distinguished by special names. Owing to the presence of the\r\nnickel, meteoric iron is often so white on a fractured surface as to\r\nbe mistaken for silver by its finder; it is also less liable to rust\r\nthan ordinary iron is. Troilite is frequently present as plates, veins\r\nor large nodules, sometimes surrounded by graphite; schreibersite is\r\nalmost always found, and occasionally also daubréelite.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Evolution of gases on heating.]\r\n\r\nFurther, various chemists have proved that hydrogen, nitrogen, marsh\r\ngas, and the carbonic oxides are evolved when meteoric iron or stone\r\nis heated; in one case a trace of helium was detected. Probably the\r\ngases were not present in the occluded state, but resulted from the\r\ndecomposition or interaction of non-gaseous constituents during the\r\nexperiments.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Figures produced by action of acids or bromine.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Pane 4l.]\r\n\r\n34. The want of homogeneity and the structure of meteoric iron are\r\nbeautifully shown by the figures generally called into existence when\r\na polished surface is exposed to the action of acids or bromine; they\r\nare due to the inequality of the action on thick or thin plates of\r\nvarious constituents, [Sidenote: Etched figures.] the plates being\r\ncomposed chiefly of two nickel-iron materials termed kamacite and\r\ntænite. A third nickel-iron material, filling up the spaces formed\r\nby the intersection of these plates of kamacite and tænite, is\r\ntermed plessite; it is probably not an independent substance but an\r\nintergrowth of the first two kinds.\r\n\r\nIn the Agram iron, investigated by Widmanstätten in 1808, the plates\r\nare parallel to the faces of the regular octahedron; such figures\r\nare well shown by the exhibited slice of the Toluca iron; different\r\ndegrees of distinctness of such \"Widmanstätten\" figures are illustrated\r\nby specimens of Seneca River, Zacatecas, Charcas, Burlington, Jewell\r\nHill, [Sidenote: Pane 4l.] Lagrange, Victoria West, Nelson County, and\r\nSeeläsgen. The large Otumpa specimen, mounted on a separate pedestal,\r\nfurnishes a good example of the less distinct, and more or less\r\ndamascene, appearance presented by the etched surface of some meteoric\r\nirons of octahedral structure.\r\n\r\nThe Braunau iron gives no \"Widmanstätten\" figures, but has cleavages\r\nparallel to the faces of a cube; on etching it yields linear furrows\r\nwhich were found (1848) by Neumann to have directions such as would\r\nresult from twinning of the cube about an octahedral face; as\r\nillustrations of the \"Neumann lines,\" etched specimens of Braunau and\r\nSalt River are exhibited. [Sidenote: Pane 4l.]\r\n\r\nFor meteoric irons of cubic structure the percentage of nickel is lower\r\nthan 6 or 7; for those of octahedral structure it is higher than 6 or\r\n7, and the plates of kamacite are thinner, and the structure therefore\r\nfiner, the higher the percentage of that metal. A considerable\r\nnumber of meteoric irons, however, show no crystalline structure at\r\nall, and have percentages of nickel both below and above 7; it has\r\nbeen suggested that these masses have been metamorphosed, and that\r\ncrystalline structure was once present, but has disappeared as a result\r\nof the meteorites having been heated, not merely superficially during\r\ntheir passage through the earth's atmosphere, but throughout their mass\r\nwhile travelling in outer space.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cooling of fused mixtures and of solutions.]\r\n\r\n35. Though meteoric iron has been at some time, presumably, in a state\r\nof fusion, and its present structure is a result of the particular\r\ncircumstances of the cooling of the liquid and afterwards solid\r\nmaterial, attempts to produce such structures by the cooling of fused\r\nmeteoric iron or artificial mixtures of nickel and iron have not yet\r\nbeen successful. It will be useful, therefore, to consider briefly\r\nsome of the manifold changes which are found to take place during the\r\npassage of fused mixtures and of solutions to the solid state, and\r\nduring the cooling of such solids to ordinary temperatures.\r\n\r\nIf a fused mixture of antimony and bismuth is allowed to cool,\r\nthe solid which first separates is neither pure antimony nor pure\r\nbismuth, but a material which has a percentage composition depending\r\non, though not identical with, that of the original mixture. The\r\ntemperature for the beginning of the solidification is different for\r\ndifferent proportions of the two metals, and is intermediate between\r\n622° and 268°, the solidifying temperatures of antimony and bismuth,\r\nrespectively; it approaches the latter more and more closely as the\r\npercentage of the bismuth is increased. The solid first separated\r\nis somewhat richer in antimony than the original mixture; the still\r\nfused part, therefore, is somewhat richer in bismuth than before,\r\nand does not begin to solidify till a lower temperature is reached;\r\nthe temperature thus gradually falls, instead of remaining constant,\r\nduring the solidification. In the cooling of such fused mixtures the\r\nchanging composition of the part still fused has for effect a changing\r\ncomposition of the solid already separated; whence the slower the\r\ncooling of the fused material, the greater is the homogeneity of the\r\nfinal solid.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Eutectic mixtures.]\r\n\r\nA fused mixture of silver and copper behaves in a different way. When\r\nthe percentage weight of the silver is 72, and that of the copper,\r\ntherefore, is 28, solidification begins, not at a temperature between\r\n960° and 1083°, the solidifying temperatures of silver and copper,\r\nrespectively, but at a temperature below both, namely, 770°. The\r\nsolid which first separates has the same percentage composition as\r\nthe original mixture; the part still fused has thus itself the same\r\npercentage composition as before, and continues to solidify at the\r\nsame temperature, and in the same way, until the solidification is\r\ncomplete. Such a mixture, having a definite composition and a definite\r\ntemperature of solidification, was for a time regarded as a definite\r\nchemical compound with a complex chemical formula, but on microscopic\r\nexamination the resultant solid is found to be heterogeneous; minute\r\nparticles of the silver and copper are seen to lie side by side,\r\nthe particles being granular or lamellar in form according to the\r\ncircumstances of the cooling. If the percentage of silver is different\r\nfrom 72, whether it be higher or lower, the solidification begins at\r\na higher temperature than 770°; whence the mixture containing 72 per\r\ncent. of silver has been conveniently termed _eutectic_ (i.e. very\r\nfusible); the term was suggested by Prof. F. Guthrie,[16] to whom our\r\nknowledge of the existence of such mixtures is due.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cooling of fused mixtures and of solutions.]\r\n\r\n36. When the silver is in excess of 72 per cent., the excess of silver\r\ngradually collects together and solidifies at various parts of the\r\ncooling fused mass; the still fused portion thus gradually becomes\r\npoorer in that metal, and the temperature, instead of remaining\r\nconstant, gradually falls during the separation of the solid. At length\r\nthe percentage of silver in the fused portion falls to 72 per cent.\r\nand the temperature to 770°; the solid which now begins to form is no\r\nlonger pure silver, but a material containing 72 per cent. of that\r\nmetal; and it continues to have the same percentage composition as the\r\nsurrounding liquid, and the temperature of solid and liquid to be 770°,\r\nuntil the solidification is complete. The final solid thus consists of\r\nblebs of silver scattered through a fine groundmass of eutectic mixture\r\nof silver and copper. Similarly, if the copper is in excess of 28 per\r\ncent., the final solid consists of blebs of copper scattered through a\r\nfine groundmass of eutectic mixture of silver and copper.\r\n\r\nIf the two metals are copper and antimony, instead of copper and\r\nsilver, the results are more complicated; for the first two metals are\r\ncapable of combining together to form a definite chemical compound\r\nrepresented by the formula Cu{2}Sb, and each of the metals forms\r\na eutectic mixture with the latter. According to the percentage\r\ncomposition of the original mixture, the solid which first separates\r\nduring cooling from fusion may be either copper or antimony or the\r\ncompound Cu{2}Sb; the separation continuing, and the temperature\r\nfalling, until the first eutectic proportion and its corresponding\r\ntemperature are reached.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cooling of solutions.]\r\n\r\n37. Analogous results are obtained during the cooling of solutions;\r\nfor instance, during the cooling of a solution of sodium chloride\r\n(common salt) in water. A solution containing 23·5 per cent. of sodium\r\nchloride begins to solidify at -22° C.; the separating solid is not\r\nsimple sodium chloride or simple ice, but has the same percentage\r\ncomposition as the original solution, and thus the temperature remains\r\n-22° until the whole material has become solid. On microscopic\r\nexamination the solid is seen to be heterogeneous, and to consist of\r\nsmall particles of sodium chloride and ice lying side by side. If the\r\npercentage of sodium chloride is different from 23·5, whether higher\r\nor lower, solidification begins before the temperature has fallen to\r\n-22°. The characters of this particular solution are thus closely\r\nanalogous to those of the eutectic mixtures described above. If the\r\nsodium chloride exceeds 23·5 per cent., the excess of sodium chloride\r\nbegins to separate, and solidify, at various parts of the liquid, at\r\na temperature higher than -22°; it continues to separate, and the\r\ntemperature to fall, until the proportion of sodium chloride in the\r\nresidual liquid is reduced to 23·5 per cent. and the temperature to\r\n-22°. Afterwards the separating solid has the same composition as\r\nthe residual liquid (23·5 per cent. of sodium chloride), and the\r\ntemperature remains constant, until the residual liquid has been wholly\r\ntransformed into a solid fine-grained mixture of sodium chloride\r\nand ice. The final solid thus consists of large particles of sodium\r\nchloride dispersed through a fine groundmass consisting of eutectic\r\nmixture of sodium chloride and ice. Similarly, if the water is in\r\nexcess of 76·5 per cent., the final solid consists of large particles\r\nof ice dispersed through a fine groundmass consisting of eutectic\r\nmixture of sodium chloride and ice.\r\n\r\nThe results of the cooling of a solution of ferric chloride are still\r\nmore complicated; for this substance enters into chemical combination\r\nwith water, and in no fewer than four different proportions. The solid\r\nwhich first separates from the cooling solution may thus, according to\r\nthe percentage of ferric chloride, be either ferric chloride or water,\r\nor any one of the various compounds of the two; and to each pair of\r\ncompounds nearest to each other in composition corresponds a different\r\neutectic mixture and a different temperature for its formation.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cooling of solids.]\r\n\r\n38. Some solid bodies, during cooling, show changes analogous to those\r\nobserved in solutions, and are therefore termed \"solid solutions.\"\r\nFor instance, if a hot physically homogeneous solid obtained from the\r\nfusion of iron with carbon is cooled, there may result a separation in\r\nthe solid of particles of either iron or cementite, the latter being\r\na chemical compound of iron and carbon represented by the formula\r\nFe{3}C; the particular substance separated depending on the percentage\r\ncomposition of the original solid. This separation continues, and the\r\ntemperature falls, until the residual physically homogeneous material\r\ncontains 0·9 per cent. of carbon and the temperature is 690°; the\r\ntemperature then remains constant, although the body is surrounded by\r\na cooling medium, until this residual physically homogeneous material\r\nhas been wholly transformed into a fine-grained mixture of iron and\r\ncementite, containing 0·9 per cent. of carbon. This particular kind of\r\nmixture has been termed eutectic, though the transformation has taken\r\nplace, not by solidification from fusion, but in a body which was\r\nalready solid. Prof. Rinne has proposed for such cases the substitution\r\nof the term _eutropic_, thus avoiding the suggestion of fusion. The\r\neutectic mixture of iron (or ferrite) and cementite is known as\r\npearlite.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Overcooling.]\r\n\r\n39. Just as water may be cooled so quietly that it is still liquid at\r\na temperature much below the normal freezing point, a mixture may be\r\ncooled in such a way as to pass much below the eutectic (or eutropic)\r\npoint without the normal transformation taking place; it is then said\r\nto be overcooled. The equilibrium, however, is very unstable, and\r\nthe transformation, once begun, takes place almost instantaneously\r\nthroughout the whole mass.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Crystalline structure of artificial iron.]\r\n\r\n40. A structure analogous to that shown by the Widmanstätten figures,\r\nthough on a finer scale, has been observed by Prof. J. O. Arnold and\r\nMr. A. McWilliam[17] in cast steel containing 0·4 per cent. of carbon;\r\nthe plates of iron (or ferrite) in the cast steel correspond to the\r\nplates of kamacite in meteorites. Further, it has been found that the\r\nplates in the cast steel disappear during the process of annealing;\r\nsimilarly, there are no Widmanstätten figures, and the structure of the\r\nmaterial is granular, near the outer surface of an unweathered meteoric\r\niron; presumably as a result of the high temperature to which the outer\r\npart of the mass has been raised during the passage of the meteorite\r\nthrough the earth's atmosphere.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Structure of meteoric irons.]\r\n\r\n41. At present it is generally imagined that kamacite and tænite are\r\ndefinite alloys, or perhaps solid solutions, of iron and nickel, the\r\nformer being poor in nickel (6 or 7 per cent.) and the latter rich\r\nin that constituent (25 to 38 per cent.), that kamacite and tænite\r\nseparate in succession from the molten mass or solid solution until\r\nthe residual part is so rich in nickel that a eutectic (or eutropic)\r\nproportion is reached; the residual material then forms plessite,\r\nwhich, according to this view, is a eutectic (or eutropic) mixture of\r\nkamacite and tænite. But it is difficult to understand how the thin\r\nplates of tænite are deposited on the plates of kamacite, seeing that\r\nthey contain more nickel than kamacite and plessite, and yet have an\r\nintermediate epoch of formation, prior to the epoch of formation of\r\nthat tænite which is a constituent of the plessite; one suggestion is\r\nthat the thin plates of tænite have been deposited on the plates of\r\nkamacite owing to the temperature having fallen well below the eutectic\r\n(or eutropic) point after the separation of the kamacite and before the\r\neutectic transformation of the residual material has taken place. And\r\nProf. Rinne[18] himself is of opinion that the Widmanstätten structure\r\nhas been wholly developed in meteoric iron after the solidification\r\nof the mass; further, as the relations of the kamacite, tænite and\r\nplessite to the enclosed troilite indicate that the troilite was solid\r\nbefore the octahedral structure was developed, and as that mineral,\r\nunder normal circumstances, solidifies at about 950°, he infers that\r\nthe structure was developed below that temperature. In the case of the\r\nJewell (Duel) Hill meteorite it was discovered by Dr. Brezina that,\r\nnotwithstanding the pronounced octahedral structure, plates of troilite\r\nare embedded, not in accidental positions nor between successive\r\noctahedral layers, but parallel to the faces of the corresponding\r\ncube; whence Prof. Rinne suggests that this iron, now of octahedral\r\nstructure, and possibly all others of a similar character, had a cubic\r\nstructure at the epoch when they entered upon the solid condition.\r\nBut, as both Prof. Rinne and Dr. Brezina[19] have pointed out, a fused\r\nmixture of nickel and iron, cooling undisturbedly in outer space, may\r\nhave solidified at a temperature even below 950° and thus have been\r\nmuch overcooled.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tænite possibly a eutectic mixture.]\r\n\r\n42. In the course of a recent elaborate investigation of the changes of\r\nthe magnetic permeability of the Sacramento meteoric iron with changing\r\ntemperature, Mr. S. W. J. Smith[20] has been led to infer that the\r\nmagnetic behaviour can only be explained by imagining the meteorite\r\nto consist largely of plates of nickel-iron, containing about 7 per\r\ncent. of nickel (kamacite), separated from each other by thin plates of\r\na nickel-iron constituent (tænite), containing about 27 per cent. of\r\nnickel and having different thermo-magnetic characters from those of\r\nkamacite; he suggests, however, that tænite is not a definite chemical\r\ncompound, but is itself a eutectic (or eutropic) mixture, and consists\r\nof kamacite and a nickel-iron compound containing not less than 37 per\r\ncent. of nickel. And he points out that, while the tænite mechanically\r\nisolated from meteorites for analysis has approximately the lower\r\npercentage (27 per cent.), the tænite chemically isolated through the\r\nprolonged action of dilute acid (which would remove much of the admixed\r\nkamacite) has a higher percentage, which in several cases approximates\r\nto 40 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Few siderites have been seen to fall.]\r\n\r\n43. The Siderites _actually observed to fall_, or found soon after a\r\nluminous meteor had been seen, or a detonation heard, by people in\r\nthe neighbourhood, reach only the small number of nine; they are,\r\nAgram, Charlotte, Braunau, Victoria West, Nedagolla, Rowton, Mazapil,\r\nCabin Creek, and N'Goureyma. The remaining specimens in collections\r\nof Siderites are presumed to be of meteoric origin by reason of the\r\npeculiarity of their appearance and chemical composition, and of the\r\ncharacters of the material in which they have been found (Art. 7).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Siderites of large size.]\r\n\r\nThe large Cranbourne meteorite, mounted in a special case in the\r\nPavilion, before rusting weighed 3-1/2 tons. The two largest known\r\nwere found in Western Greenland and Mexico, respectively, and are both\r\nof very irregular shape. The Greenland mass is 11 feet long, 7-1/2\r\nfeet wide, and 6 feet thick, and its weight, which had been variously\r\nestimated at from 50 to 100 tons, has been determined to be 36-1/2\r\ntons; the mass had long been known to the Eskimos, and was inquired\r\nafter by Captain John Ross in 1818; it was shown by a native to\r\nLieutenant Peary in 1894, who afterwards transported it from Melville\r\nBay to New York; it is now preserved in the American Museum of Natural\r\nHistory in that city. The Mexican mass is 13 feet long, 6 feet wide,\r\nand 5 feet thick, and has an estimated weight of 50 tons; it is the\r\nproperty of the Mexican Government, and is still lying at El Ranchito,\r\nnear Bacubirito, Province of Sinaloa.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The iron found at Ovifak is probably of terrestrial origin.]\r\n\r\n44. The difficulty of distinguishing an iron of terrestrial from one of\r\nmeteoric origin was rendered very evident by the prolonged controversy\r\nas to the origin of the large masses of iron, containing one or two\r\nper cent. of nickel, and weighing 9,000, 20,000, and 50,000 lbs.,\r\nrespectively, found in 1870 by Baron N. A. E. Nordenskiöld on the beach\r\nat Ovifak, Disko Island, Western Greenland.\r\n\r\nA careful examination of the rocks of the neighbourhood shows that\r\nthe basalt contains nickeliferous iron disseminated through it, and\r\nthat the large masses of iron, [Sidenote: Pane 4m.] at first thought\r\nto be meteorites, are very probably of terrestrial origin, and have\r\nbeen left exposed upon the seashore through the weathering of the\r\nrock which originally enclosed them. Some of the malleable metallic\r\nnodules extracted from the basalt were found to contain as much as\r\n6·5 per cent. of nickel. In 1880 Professor K. J. V. Steenstrup[21]\r\nfound ferriferous basalt _in situ_ in three different parts of the\r\nisland. At Assuk (Asuk) the enclosed balls of iron reach a diameter of\r\nnearly three-quarters of an inch. Some assert that the basalt and the\r\nnickel-iron have been expelled together from great depths below the\r\nearth's surface, while others consider that the nickel-iron is due to\r\nthe reduction of the iron-compounds in the basalt by the passage of the\r\nlava through the beds of lignite and other vegetable matter found in\r\nthe vicinity.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Other terrestrial irons.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Pane 4m.]\r\n\r\n45. With the Ovifak iron in the case are shown other specimens of iron\r\nwhich have been brought by various explorers from West Greenland, and\r\nwere formerly thought to have had a meteoric origin. The discovery of\r\nferriferous basalt, not only _in situ_ in several places, but also\r\ndeposited in a Greenlander's grave (1879) along with knives (similar\r\nto those given to Captain John Ross in 1818) and the usual stone\r\ntools, renders it clear that the Eskimos were not dependent solely on\r\nmeteorites for their metallic iron, as had long been supposed.\r\n\r\nMr. Skey announced in 1885 the discovery of terrestrial nickel-iron\r\nin New Zealand. Grains of the alloy (Awaruite), containing as much as\r\n67·6 per cent. of nickel, are found in the sand of the rivers flowing\r\nfrom a range of mountains composed of olivine-enstatite rocks, in\r\nplaces altered to serpentine: similar particles have been found in the\r\nserpentine itself. Similarly, in the sand of the stream Elvo, near\r\nBiella, in Piedmont, and of the river Fraser, British Columbia, grains\r\nof nickel-iron containing 75 or 76 per cent. of nickel have been found:\r\nand in the placer gravel of a stream in Josephine and Jackson Counties,\r\nOregon, U.S.A., large quantities of waterworn pebbles, which enclose\r\nan alloy (Josephinite) of nickel and iron containing 72 per cent. of\r\nthe former metal, have been met with. Professor Andrews many years ago\r\nestablished the presence of minute particles of metallic iron in some\r\nbasalts; Dr. Sauer has lately found a single nodule of malleable iron\r\nof the size of a walnut in the basalt of Ascherhübel, in Saxony; Dr.\r\nHornstein has described large nodules of (nickel-free) iron found in\r\nbasalt in a quarry at Weimar, near Cassel; Dr. Beckenkamp has described\r\nnodules of metallic iron found in clay at Dettelbach, near Würzburg;\r\nand Dr. Johnston-Lavis has announced the find of an enclosure of\r\nmetallic iron in a leucitic lava of Monte Somma; Dr. Hoffmann has noted\r\nthe occurrence of minute spherules of brittle iron both in perthite\r\nand quartzite in Ontario; Dr. Hussak has recorded the discovery of\r\nmetallic iron in an alluvium of Brazil, and Dr. Högbom has found it\r\nassociated with topaz, quartz, felspar, and other minerals, in limonite\r\nfrom an unspecified place in South America; two minute grains of iron\r\nwere found by Mr. Osaka in the débris of an agglomerate at Nishinotake,\r\nJapan.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The stony matter of meteorites.]\r\n\r\n46. The stony part of the siderolites and aerolites is almost entirely\r\ncrystalline, and in most cases presents a peculiar \"chondritic\" or\r\ngranular structure, the loosely coherent grains being composed of\r\nminerals similar to those which enclose them, and containing in most\r\ncases minute particles of iron and troilite disseminated through them:\r\nglass-inclusions are found to be present. The minerals mentioned above\r\nas occurring in meteorites are such as are very characteristic of the\r\nmore basic terrestrial rocks, such as dunite, lherzolite and basalt,\r\nwhich have been expelled from considerable depths below the earth's\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\n\r\n47. Several attempts to classify aerolites according to their\r\nmineralogical constitution have been made, but it cannot be said that\r\nany of them is very satisfactory; seeing that even in the same stone\r\nthere may be much difference in its parts, a perfect classification on\r\nsuch a basis is scarcely to be hoped for.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Chondritic aerolites.]\r\n\r\nAbout eleven out of every twelve of the stony meteorites belong to a\r\ndivision to which Rose[22] gave the name of _chondritic_ (_chondros_,\r\na grain): they present a very fine-grained but crystalline matrix or\r\npaste, consisting of olivine and enstatite or bronzite, with more or\r\nless nickel-iron, troilite, chromite, augite and anorthic felspar;\r\nthrough this paste are disseminated round chondrules of various sizes\r\n(up to that of a walnut) and with the same mineral composition as the\r\nmatrix; in some cases the chondrules consist wholly or in great part\r\nof glass.[23] In mineral composition chondritic aerolites approximate\r\nmore or less to terrestrial lherzolites. Some meteorites consist\r\nalmost solely of chondrules, others contain only few; in some cases\r\nthe chondrules are easy separable from the surrounding material. Of\r\nthe chondritic division Knyahinya, Pegu, Muddoor, [Sidenote: Pane 4n.]\r\nSeres, Judesegeri, Khiragurh, Utrecht and Nellore (pane 4p) afford good\r\nillustrations.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A carbonaceous group.]\r\n\r\nA few meteorites belonging to this division are remarkable as\r\ncontaining carbon in combination with hydrogen and oxygen. Of these\r\nthe Alais and Cold Bokkeveld meteorites [Sidenote: Pane 4n.] are good\r\nexamples: the former has a bituminous smell; it yields sulphates of\r\nmagnesium, calcium, sodium and potassium, if steeped in water.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Aerolites without chondrules.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Pane 4o.]\r\n\r\n48. The remaining aerolites are not chondritic, and they contain little\r\nor no nickel-iron; of these we may specially mention for their mineral\r\ncomposition the following:--\r\n\r\n_Juvinas_ and _Stannern_, consisting essentially of anorthite and\r\naugite.\r\n\r\n_Petersburg_, consisting of anorthite, augite and olivine, with a\r\nlittle chromite and nickel-iron: both Juvinas and Petersburg may be\r\ncompared to terrestrial basalt.\r\n\r\n_Sherghotty_, consisting chiefly of augite and maskelynite.\r\n\r\n_Angra dos Reis_, consisting almost wholly of augite; olivine is\r\npresent in small proportion.\r\n\r\n_Bustee_, of diopside, enstatite and a little anorthic felspar, with\r\nsome nickel-iron, oldhamite and osbornite.\r\n\r\n_Bishopville_, of enstatite and anorthic felspar, with occasional\r\naugite, nickel-iron, troilite and chromite.\r\n\r\n_Roda_, of olivine and bronzite.\r\n\r\n_Chassigny_, consisting of olivine with enclosed chromite, and thus\r\nmineralogically similar to a terrestrial dunite.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Is there a periodic recurrence?]\r\n\r\n49. The importance of the examination and classification of\r\nmeteorites, with a view to a possible recognition of _periodicity_\r\nof fall of specimens presenting the same characters, need only be\r\nmentioned to be appreciated: such a determination is, however, rendered\r\nvery difficult by the close similarity of structure and composition\r\npresented by the great majority of the aerolites of the large\r\nchondritic division.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Few aerolites are known which have not been seen to fall.]\r\n\r\n50. Attention has been already directed to the fact that although\r\nmany masses of meteoric iron, some of them like that of El Ranchito,\r\nnear Bacubirito, in Mexico, weighing very many tons, have been found\r\nat various parts of the earth's surface, very few of them have been\r\nactually observed to fall: in the case of the stony meteorites just\r\nthe opposite holds good, for they are never very large, and few are\r\nknown which have not an authenticated date of fall. This may be due to\r\nthe fact that a meteoric stone is less easily distinguished than is a\r\nmeteoric iron from ordinary terrestrial bodies, and will thus in most\r\ncases remain unnoticed unless its fall has been actually observed;\r\nwhile, further, a quick decomposition and disintegration must set in on\r\nexposure to atmospheric influences. The smaller size of the meteoric\r\nstones may be due to the greater ease with which they break up on the\r\nsudden increase of temperature of their outer surface, consequent\r\non their entry into the earth's atmosphere. The largest meteoric\r\nstone preserved in a Museum is one which fell as part of a shower at\r\nKnyahinya, Hungary, in 1866: it weighs 647 lbs. and is at Vienna. A\r\nlarger stone (723 lbs.) fell at Tabory, Russia, in 1887, but was broken\r\nto pieces by the impact on the earth; fragments of a still larger\r\nsingle stone, weighing at least 1244 lbs., were found near together at\r\nLong Island, Kansas, U.S.A., but the fall was not observed.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The chondrules and their matrix.]\r\n\r\n51. If we now examine minutely the structure of the meteoric stones,\r\nit will be seen that almost all of them appear to be made up chiefly\r\nof irregular angular fragments, and that some of them bear a close\r\nresemblance to volcanic tuffs. In the large group of chondritic\r\naerolites, chondrules or spherules, some of which can only be seen\r\nunder the microscope while others reach the size of a walnut, are\r\nembedded in a matrix, apparently made up of minute splinters such as\r\nmight result from the fracture of the chondrules themselves. In fact,\r\nuntil recently, it was thought by some[24] that the chondrules owe\r\ntheir form, not to crystallisation, but to friction, and that the\r\nmatrix was actually produced by the wearing down of the chondrules\r\nthrough collision with each other either as oscillating components of\r\na comet or during repeated ejection from a volcanic vent of some small\r\ncelestial body. Chondrules have been observed, however, presenting\r\nforms and crystalline surfaces incompatible with such a mode of\r\nformation, and others have been described which exhibit features\r\nresulting from mutual interference during their growth.\r\n\r\nThe crystallisation of the chondrules is independent of their form,\r\nand must have started, not at the centre, but at various places\r\non their surfaces; Dr. Sorby[25] argued that some at least of the\r\nchondrules must once have fallen as drops of fiery rain, and have\r\nassumed their shape in an atmosphere heated to nearly their own\r\ntemperature. The chondritic structure is different from anything\r\nwhich has been observed in terrestrial rocks, and the chondrules are\r\ndistinct in character from those observed in perlite and obsidian.\r\nAfter much study, Dr. Brezina[26] lends his weighty support to the\r\nhypothesis that the structural features of meteorites are the result\r\nof a hurried crystallisation: and Prof. Wadsworth[27] accepts the same\r\ninterpretation.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Some meteoric materials appear to have been altered since\r\ntheir consolidation.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Pane 4o.]\r\n\r\n52. Since the time of their consolidation some meteoric stones, as\r\nTadjera, appear to have been heated throughout their mass to a high\r\ntemperature: and in the case of Orvinio, Chantonnay, Juvinas, and\r\nWeston, fragments are cemented together with a material having the\r\nsame composition as the fragments themselves, thus giving rise to\r\na structure resembling that of a volcanic breccia. Others seem to\r\nhave experienced a chemical change, for some of the chondrules in\r\nKnyahinya and in Mezö-Madaras, when examined with the microscope, are\r\nfound to be surrounded by spherical and concentric aggregations of\r\nminute particles of nickel-iron, perhaps due to the reducing action\r\nof hydrogen at a high temperature. Others, as Château-Renard, Pultusk\r\nand Alessandria, present what in terrestrial rocks would probably be\r\ncalled faults: in some cases the fissures are seen to have been filled\r\nwith a fused material after the chondrules have been broken and one\r\nside of the fissure has glided along the other. These peculiarities of\r\nstructure suggest that the small body which reaches the earth is only\r\na minute fragment of a much larger mass. It has been suggested that\r\nthe chondritic structure is of metamorphic origin, and a mere result\r\nof enormous pressure on the stony material during the passage through\r\nthe earth's atmosphere; according to still another view, the structure,\r\nthough metamorphic, is of extra-terrestrial origin, and due to the\r\nquick cooling of a tuff-like stone which has been partially melted, for\r\ninstance, by the heat from a neighbouring new star or by traversing the\r\nhot vapours on the limits of an old one.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Do meteorites reach our atmosphere as clouds of gas or dust?]\r\n\r\n53. The idea that meteorites arrive at our own atmosphere, not as\r\nfragments of rock, but as mere clouds of gas or dust, has been recently\r\nrevived and again discarded. According to this hypothesis, the air,\r\ninstead of dispersing the entering cloud, acts in the contrary way,\r\nand in a few seconds of time presses the particles together to form\r\nsolid bodies. This idea is open to various objections, and in any case\r\none can scarcely understand how large masses of iron, presenting a\r\nwonderful regularity of crystalline structure, can have been the result\r\nof so hurried a process: and if we once grant that the irons enter the\r\natmosphere as solid bodies, it is difficult to believe that the same is\r\nnot the case with the stones.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Where do meteorites come from?]\r\n\r\n54. From the above it will be evident that the old hypotheses that\r\nmeteorites are terrestrial stones which have been struck by lightning,\r\nor carried to the sky by a whirlwind, or are concretions in the\r\natmosphere, or are due to the condensation of a dust-cloud coming from\r\nsome volcano, or have been shot recently from terrestrial volcanoes,\r\nare inconsistent with later observation; it may be granted that the\r\nbodies reach our atmosphere from outer space. From what part or parts\r\nof space do they come? Their general similarity of structure and\r\nchemical composition, and more especially the presence of nickeliferous\r\niron in almost every one, suggest that most, if not all of them, have\r\nhad a common source, and that they are chips of a single celestial body.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Probably not from the sun, nor from the moon, earth, or\r\nother planet.]\r\n\r\n55. Dr. Sorby suggested that they are probably ejected from the sun\r\nitself, though this is difficult to reconcile with the fact that some\r\nof them are easily combustible. Others, among whom we may mention\r\nLaplace, have suggested that they come from volcanoes of the moon which\r\nare now active; but the suggestion, although mathematically sound, has\r\nno physical basis, for, so far as one can discover, active volcanoes\r\ndo not there exist: and Sir Robert Ball[28] has virtually excluded the\r\nlunar volcanoes, which were active in times now long past, by pointing\r\nout that if a projectile from the moon once misses the earth, its\r\nchance of ever reaching the earth is too small to be worthy of mention.\r\nIt has further been shown that, although the explosive force necessary\r\nto carry a projectile so far from one of the smaller planets that it\r\nwill not return, is not very large, yet the initial velocity requisite\r\nto carry the body as far as the earth's orbit is so considerable,\r\nand the chance of hitting the earth so slight, that a more probable\r\nhypothesis is, to say the least, desirable. If these bodies have been\r\nshot from volcanoes of any planet, Sir Robert Ball is himself inclined,\r\nupon mechanical grounds alone, to believe that the projection was from\r\nour own in bygone ages; for as such projectiles, having once got away\r\nfrom the earth, would take up paths round the sun which would intersect\r\nthe earth's orbit, every one of them would have a chance of some time\r\nor other meeting with the earth again at the point of intersection, and\r\nof appearing as a meteorite. The size and initial velocity requisite\r\nfor the escape of a projectile through a lofty atmosphere would be\r\nenormous: even then the difficulty would still remain that meteorites\r\ngenerally differ, both in structure and material, from anything known\r\nto have been ejected from existing terrestrial volcanoes. To meet\r\nthese difficulties, Sir Robert has speculatively suggested that the\r\nmatter was expelled before the surface of the earth became solid, and\r\nat a time when there was as much activity in the terrestrial planet as\r\nthere is now in the material of the sun itself.\r\n\r\nNor is it probable that they are portions of a lost satellite of the\r\nearth, or are due to a collision of two planets; for in each of these\r\ncases we should expect to have received some of the larger fragments\r\nwhich must at the same time have been produced.\r\n\r\nMuch light is thrown on the history of meteorites by the discovery of a\r\nrelationship with shooting stars and comets.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Shooting or falling stars.]\r\n\r\n56. The meteorite-yielding fireball, referred to in Art. 17, is not\r\nthe only luminous meteor, apart from lightning, with which we are\r\nacquainted. On a clear dark night any one can see a star shoot now\r\nand then across the firmament: it is estimated that on the average as\r\nmany as fourteen are visible to a single observer every hour. Are the\r\n_shooting_, or, as they are often called, _falling stars_ products of\r\nour own atmosphere, or do they, like the meteorites, come from outer\r\nspace? In 1794 Chladni, in the memoir already referred to, gave reasons\r\nfor believing that a meteoritic fireball and a shooting star are only\r\nvarieties of one phenomenon.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The November star-showers.]\r\n\r\n57. But long after the cosmic origin of meteorites had been generally\r\nacknowledged, the atmospheric origin of the shooting stars was still\r\nasserted, and it was not till the wondrous star-shower of November\r\n12-13, 1833,[29] that the cosmic origin of any of the shooting stars\r\nwas finally established. During that night upwards of 200,000 shooting\r\nstars, according to a rough estimate, were seen from a single place;\r\nand the remarkable observation was made at various localities, widely\r\ndistributed over North America, that the apparent paths of the shooting\r\nstars in the sky, when prolonged backwards, all passed through a point\r\nin the constellation Leo: this point of radiation appeared to rotate\r\nwith the heavens during the eight hours for which the shower was\r\nvisible.\r\n\r\nHence it was manifest that the star-shower was independent of the\r\nearth's rotation and must therefore have come from outer space; that\r\nthe radiation of the paths was only apparent and due to perspective;\r\nand that, relatively to an observer, the flights of all the shooting\r\nstars were really parallel to the direction of the apparent radiant\r\npoint.\r\n\r\nOn the same day of November in each of the three following years the\r\nshower was repeated though on a less grand scale, and the constancy of\r\nthe radiant point was confirmed: similar small showers had been seen\r\nalso in 1831 and 1832 before the radiation had been noticed. Though in\r\nthe years immediately before and after 1831-6 no remarkable display\r\nof November meteors took place, it was remembered that a similar\r\nshower had been chronicled by Humboldt and by Ellicott, as observed by\r\nthem on November 12, 1799; and a study of ancient documents revealed\r\nthe fact that a grand star-shower had been recorded several times\r\nin October and November since A.D. 902, the date having gradually\r\nadvanced, during that long space of time, from the middle of October\r\nto the middle of November.[30] The only sufficient explanation of the\r\nobserved facts is that a swarm of isolated small bodies, solid and\r\nnon-luminous--meteorites in fact--is moving in an orbit round the sun,\r\ncompleting the circuit in 33-1/4 years; the orbit intersects that of\r\nthe earth, and the earth meets the swarm at the place of intersection.\r\nThe isolated bodies or meteorites become luminous, as already explained\r\nin Art. 17, after their entry into the earth's atmosphere. The swarm\r\ncan be only a few hundred thousand miles thick, for the earth,\r\ntravelling through space at the rate of 66,000 miles an hour, passes\r\nthrough the densest part in 2 or 3 hours, and through the whole in\r\n10 to 15 hours: its length, however, must be enormous, amounting to\r\nhundreds of millions of miles; for, although the meteorites move with\r\na velocity of twenty miles a second, the swarm takes 5 or 6 years to\r\npass the place of intersection with the earth's orbit, thus causing\r\nstar-showers, more or less dense, during that number of years.\r\n\r\nContrary to expectation, no large November star-shower occurred either\r\nin the year 1899 or in the years which have since elapsed.\r\n\r\nSchiaparelli has shown that the unequal attraction of the sun for the\r\nindividuals of a swarm of meteorites moving round it would scatter\r\nthem along the orbit, and in the course of time produce a more or\r\nless complete ring; if this intersects the earth's orbit an annual\r\nstar-shower must ensue.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The August star-shower and its comet.]\r\n\r\n58. A small annual star-shower occurs, in fact, on August 10-11,[31]\r\nand has been observed since A.D. 830: it radiates from a point in the\r\nconstellation Perseus. Schiaparelli calculated in 1866 the orbit and\r\nmotion of the meteorites producing it, and was surprised to find that\r\nthe numbers corresponded exactly with those calculated for one of the\r\nrecently observed comets; in other words, a comet was moving in the\r\npath of the meteorites, and at exactly the same speed. At the same time\r\nSchiaparelli gave numbers defining the motions of the meteorites which\r\nwould cause the periodic November star-showers.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Star-showers related to comets.]\r\n\r\n59. Immediately afterwards, when the numbers calculated by Oppolzer\r\nfor the orbit of the comet discovered by Tempel were published, it was\r\nseen that they were really identical with those already calculated\r\nby Schiaparelli for the orbit of the meteorites of the November\r\nstar-shower, and that here again a comet and a swarm of meteorites were\r\nmoving in exactly the same path at exactly the same rate.\r\n\r\nAlmost immediately afterwards it was shown that the radiant points\r\nof the small star-showers of April 20-21 and November 27-28 both\r\ncorrespond to the orbits of known comets.\r\n\r\nIt was evident that these could not be accidental coincidences, and\r\nthat the comets and the attendant swarms of meteorites are closely\r\nrelated to each other.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Comets.]\r\n\r\n60. An intimate connection between, if not complete identity of,\r\nmeteorites, shooting stars and comets, had indeed long been suspected.\r\nAstronomers were convinced that comets, though occasionally of enormous\r\nsize, are always of extremely small mass, since they pass by the\r\nearth and other planets without sensibly disturbing their motions;\r\nthe comet of 1770 passed through the system of Jupiter's satellites\r\nwithout any perceptible action upon them: it has been calculated that\r\nthe mass of a small comet may be about eight pounds. Again, the light\r\nof a comet, like that of a cloud or planet, was seen to be partially\r\npolarised: hence part, at least, must be reflected sunlight, for the\r\nplane of polarisation passes through the sun's place. Further, stars\r\nof very small magnitude have been seen not only through the tail, but\r\neven through the nucleus, of a comet without any apparent alteration\r\nof position by refraction: hence it was inferred that a comet is not\r\na continuous mass, but consists of particles so far distant from each\r\nother that a ray of light may pass through the comet without meeting\r\na single one of them. Such a constitution likewise accounts for the\r\nabsence of phases of the reflected light: for although only half of\r\neach particle will be directly illuminated by the sun, the remaining\r\nhalf will receive light irregularly reflected from the particles more\r\ndistant from the sun.\r\n\r\nAmong others, Chladni in 1817 had referred to the great similarity in\r\nthe motions of comets and meteorites: Olmsted, in 1834, had calculated\r\nthe orbit of a comet which would cause the November star-shower; his\r\nresults were wrong owing to the assumption that the shower was annual:\r\nCappocci, in 1842, gave reasons for believing that a meteorite is a\r\nsmall comet: Reichenbach, in 1858, in a most elaborate paper,[32]\r\nsought to prove that a comet is a swarm of meteorites; that each\r\nchondrule of a meteorite had once been an individual of a cometary\r\nswarm, and owes its rounded shape to frequent collision with its\r\nfellows; that the rest of the stone consists of the broken splinters\r\nthus produced; and that the brecciated aspect of many meteorites\r\nis due to collisions in the denser part or nucleus of a comet. As\r\nalready pointed out in Art. 51, later modes of investigation have led\r\npetrologists to reject this method of accounting for the rotundity of\r\nthe chondrules.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Other star-showers.]\r\n\r\n61. In addition to the few radiant points which correspond to swarms\r\nmoving in orbits identical with those of known comets, there are\r\nnumerous radiant points which have not yet been recognised as related\r\nto existing comets, and may possibly be due to swarms produced by the\r\ndispersal of comets along their orbits; indeed, it has been inferred\r\nfrom observation of shooting stars that on the average there are no\r\nfewer than fifty distinct radiant points, and therefore showers, for\r\nany night of the year. But there are still others of which there is\r\nyet no satisfactory explanation. A cometary swarm is thin, and is\r\npassed through in a few hours; the stars are seen to radiate from the\r\ncorresponding point of the sky for only that length of time: but there\r\nare other radiant points which have a duration of several months, and\r\nthis is the case notwithstanding the constantly changing direction of\r\nthe earth's motion in space.[33] Since the position of the radiant\r\npoint in the sky as seen by a terrestrial observer depends not only on\r\nthe direction in which the swarm is moving, but also on the velocity\r\nand direction of motion of the observer through space, it is easily\r\nseen that a radiant point having a fixed position during some months\r\ncorresponds to something quite distinct from a cometary swarm. It\r\nhas been suggested by Mr. W. F. Denning (1899) that in some cases a\r\nlong-continued radiant point may really be due, not to a single swarm,\r\nbut to successive swarms not physically associated with each other.\r\nOn the other hand, Professor H. H. Turner has shown that the average\r\neffect of the earth's attraction on a meteorite passing near it is to\r\nchange only the _position_ in our orbit at which we meet the meteorite\r\n(i.e. the time of year), not the relative-direction of motion or the\r\nrelative speed; hence, a swarm of such meteorites must be spread\r\nout, in the course of ages, into a succession of rings, all of them\r\nequally inclined to the earth's orbit, but intersecting it at different\r\nplaces; the radiant point will then be of long duration. Professor\r\nA. S. Herschel[34] made the suggestion that the radiant points of\r\nlong duration may have resulted from the passage, in bygone epochs,\r\nof quickly moving streams of cosmical matter through a ring of small\r\nbodies circulating, as satellites, round the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Daily and yearly maxima of shooting stars.]\r\n\r\n62. The rotation of the earth round its axis is such that the part\r\nfurthest from the sun, for which it is therefore midnight, is moving\r\nin the same direction as the earth in its orbit; whence, at the part\r\nof the earth most forward in the orbit it is sunrise, and at the part\r\nmost backward it is sunset. Thus, as Schiaparelli pointed out, the\r\nmeteorites which enter the atmosphere in the first half of the night\r\nare more or less following the earth in its orbit, and have their\r\nvelocity relative to the earth diminished by the earth's own motion\r\nof translation; they are thus less likely to produce shooting stars\r\nthan those which enter the atmosphere in the second half of the night\r\nand are travelling more or less oppositely to the earth as it moves in\r\nits orbit, and have their relative velocity increased. Hence, if the\r\ndirections of flight of meteorites were uniformly distributed in space,\r\nthe number of shooting stars hourly visible at one place, a number\r\nwhich would be constant if the earth were at rest, would gradually vary\r\nduring the night, reaching a maximum about 3 A.M.\r\n\r\nAlso, as the point in space towards which the earth is moving in\r\nits orbit varies in height above the horizon during the year, being\r\nhighest in autumn and lowest in spring, the number of shooting stars\r\nhourly visible at one place will gradually vary from night to night,\r\nreaching a maximum in the former season and a minimum in the latter,\r\nif the directions of flight of the meteorites be themselves uniformly\r\ndistributed in space.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The breaking up of comets.]\r\n\r\n63. The history of Biela's comet[35] is of great interest as throwing\r\nlight on the relationship of comets and swarms of meteorites. Though\r\nalready observed in 1772 and in 1806, this comet was not recognised\r\nas periodic till it was seen by Biela in 1826, when its orbit was\r\ndetermined. On its returns in 1832 and 1845 it was found in its\r\ncalculated positions, but in the latter year was seen to be double, a\r\nsmall comet being visible beside a larger one. Vast changes took place\r\nduring the time the companions were visible. The smaller one grew both\r\nin size and brightness, each threw out a tail, the smaller threw out\r\na second tail, afterwards the larger showed two nuclei and two tails,\r\nthen the smaller became the brighter of the two companions; next three\r\ntails were shown by the primary, and three cometary fragments were\r\nvisible round its nucleus. On the next return, in 1852, the two comets\r\nwere farther apart, one being more than a million miles ahead of the\r\nother. The next favourable return was to be in 1866, and the orbit was\r\nby this time so well known that the positions of the two companions\r\ncould be calculated beforehand with great precision; owing to the\r\nchanges which had been visibly taking place, the arrival of the comets\r\nwas looked forward to with great interest by astronomers. But neither\r\nin 1866, nor on the next occasion in 1872, were they to be seen in\r\ntheir calculated positions, and a careful examination of the whole sky\r\nfailed to lead to their discovery.\r\n\r\nThe connexion between several comets and meteoritic swarms having\r\nin the meantime been established, it was now surmised that Biela's\r\ncomet might have been scattered along part of its path, and that\r\nsome evidence of the dispersal might perhaps be obtained on the next\r\noccasion, November 27, 1872, of the passage of the earth across the\r\ncomet's orbit. In fact the star-shower of that date, with a radiant\r\npoint corresponding to the orbit of Biela's comet, was observed to be\r\nmuch more dense than usual, the stars shooting across the sky at the\r\nrate of a thousand an hour for several hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Passage of the earth through a comet.]\r\n\r\n64. Klinkerfues, a German astronomer, was struck with the idea that if\r\nthis star-shower were really due to the passage of the earth through\r\na moving swarm of meteorites, the latter might possibly be visible\r\nas it departed from our neighbourhood. The swarm having come from\r\na radiant point in the northern sky, after passing the earth would\r\nneed to be sought near the opposite point in the southern sky; he\r\ntelegraphed, therefore, to the Madras observatory, asking Pogson, the\r\nastronomer, to search for the swarm in the direction opposite to the\r\nradiant point. The search was successful; on two mornings a small comet\r\nwas distinctly seen, and on the second morning it showed a tail with\r\nan apparent length equal to one-fourth the apparent diameter of the\r\nmoon. Bad weather came on, and the comet got away without being again\r\nseen. The two Madras observations agree with a motion in the orbit\r\nof Biela's comet, and show that the earth had passed excentrically\r\nthrough the small comet seen by Pogson. This small comet was probably\r\na third fragment of Biela's, for it was 200 million miles behind the\r\ncalculated position of the first two. From these two observations it\r\nis inferred that a swarm of meteorites, though only manifesting itself\r\nby a star-shower when passing through the earth's atmosphere, at some\r\ndistance from us may be visible as a comet by reflected sunlight.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fall of a meteorite during a star-shower.]\r\n\r\n65. A dense star-shower[36] recurred on the same day of the month\r\n(November 27) in 1885, the principal part being over in six hours. The\r\nhourly number visible at one place at the time of greatest density was\r\nestimated at 75,000. In the densest part of the stream, the average\r\ndistance of the individuals from each other was about twenty miles.\r\n\r\nDuring this star-shower a piece of iron weighing about 8 lbs. was seen\r\nto fall at Mazapil in Mexico:[37] in external characters and chemical\r\ncomposition it is similar to the other meteoric irons: the simultaneity\r\nwas probably accidental.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The reason of its rarity.]\r\n\r\n66. It may be asked why, if star-showers are caused by the entry of\r\nsolid bodies into our atmosphere from without, there is only one\r\nauthentic instance of material being actually seen to fall and being\r\npicked up during such a shower. As it is absolutely beyond question\r\nthat star-showers do come from outer space, we can seek an explanation\r\nonly in the size or speed of the entering individuals, or in the nature\r\nof their material. A sufficient reason is to be found in the small\r\nsize of the individuals; for the meteorites which actually reach the\r\nground rarely weigh more than a few pounds, and are often quite minute;\r\na small diminution of the original individual would thus ensure its\r\ncomplete destruction before the planetary velocity was exhausted: that\r\nthe individuals of a swarm are extremely minute follows from the fact\r\nthat the total mass of the biggest swarm is small, while the number of\r\nthe individuals seems almost infinite.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Large and small luminous meteors essentially similar.]\r\n\r\n67. Between the small silent shooting star visible only with the\r\ntelescope and the large detonating meteorite-yielding fireball\r\nthere is every gradation; during the star-showers themselves many\r\nfireballs of great size and brilliancy are seen, while the smaller\r\nindividuals appear in no way different from the solitary shooting star.\r\nThe luminous meteors, large and small, are in the upper atmosphere,\r\nfew higher than 100 miles, few lower than 30 miles from the earth's\r\nsurface; they all have velocities of the same order of magnitude,\r\ncomparable with that of the earth in its orbit; in each there must be\r\na solid body, as is proved by the long path in the sky, for attendant\r\ngas or vapour would be immediately scattered or burnt; large and small\r\npresent similar varieties of colour, and leave similar luminous trails;\r\nexamination with the spectroscope teaches us that the light of the\r\nmeteors is such as would result from the ignition of such meteorites as\r\nhave actually reached the ground. The frequent absence of detonation\r\nmay likewise be due in many cases to the small size, or small relative\r\nvelocity, of the entering meteorite.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The light of a comet.]\r\n\r\n68. That part of the light of a comet is reflected sunlight is\r\nconfirmed by examination with the spectroscope, in which instrument is\r\nseen a feeble continuous spectrum crossed by dark lines, identical with\r\nthose afforded by the direct light of the sun. But a comet is also more\r\nor less self-luminous; for, in addition to the continuous spectrum,\r\nthere are bright flutings and bright lines to which much attention\r\nhas been given. The three ordinary bright flutings were found by Sir\r\nWilliam Huggins in 1868 to be identical with the spectrum obtained\r\nwhen an electric spark is passed through olefiant gas, and they are\r\nnow recognised as due to carbon. The carbon is presumed to be combined\r\nwith hydrogen, sometimes also with nitrogen; in the case of comets\r\napproaching very near the sun, the lines of sodium, and others which\r\nhave been supposed to be iron-lines, are seen.[38]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tait's suggestion.]\r\n\r\n69. The discovery made by Schiaparelli proves, as already pointed out,\r\nthat there is a relationship between comets and meteoritic swarms;\r\nSchiaparelli himself held the view that a comet and its attendant\r\nswarms are merely of identical origin. In 1869[39] Tait discussed,\r\nfrom a purely dynamical point of view, the question as to whether\r\nthe swarm of meteorites attending a comet may not really be part of\r\nthe comet itself; he showed that many cometary characters can be\r\nmechanically explained on the assumption that comets are really swarms\r\nof small meteorites, and pointed out that the self-luminosity may be\r\nproduced by the heating of the individuals through collision with each\r\nother.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reproduction of the spectrum of a comet.]\r\n\r\n70. Flutings exactly identical with those seen in the spectrum of a\r\ncomet were obtained by Professor A. W. Wright in 1875[40] on allowing\r\nthe electric glow to pass through a heated tube, in which, after the\r\nintroduction of fragments of the Iowa meteorite, the gaseous density\r\nhad been reduced by an air-pump. The bright lines, too, in the spectrum\r\nof a comet, even when nearest to the sun, are found by Sir Norman\r\nLockyer to be identical with those yielded when the electric glow is\r\npassed over ordinary meteorites at comparatively low temperatures; and\r\nfurther, the changes in these lines as the comet approaches and recedes\r\nfrom the sun are exactly those which take place on variation of the\r\ntemperature of the meteorites enclosed in the glow-tubes.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A comet is perhaps a swarm of meteorites.]\r\n\r\n71. From these facts it is inferred that a comet may be in every\r\ninstance a swarm of isolated large or minute meteorites, at a not very\r\nhigh temperature, shining partly by reflected sunlight and partly by\r\nthe electric glowing of the gases evolved owing to the action of the\r\nsun's heat on the meteorites: further, some of the heat may be due to\r\nthe clashing together of the meteorites, the grouping of which becomes\r\nmore and more condensed as the swarm approaches the sun.\r\n\r\nThe gases driven from the meteorites by the sun's heat would be quite\r\nsufficient in quantity to form the tail of the comet: as pointed out by\r\nProfessor Wright, a meteorite like that which fell at Cold Bokkeveld\r\nwould furnish 30 cubic miles of gas measured at the pressure of our\r\nown atmosphere, and in space itself this gas would expand to enormous\r\ndimensions owing to the small mass and attraction of the meteoritic\r\nswarm. We are still uncertain, however, as regards the actual physical\r\ncondition of the matter composing the tail of a comet.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Saturn's rings are probably swarms of meteorites.]\r\n\r\n72. Clerk-Maxwell proved, as long ago as 1857, that the stability\r\nof the rings which revolve round the planet Saturn is inconsistent\r\nwith their being formed of continuous solid or liquid matter; and has\r\nshown, by mechanical reasoning, that they must be revolving clouds of\r\nsmall separate bodies, like cannon-shot, each moving as a satellite\r\nand almost independent of the rest in its motion: determination of the\r\nmotions of the inner and outer parts of the ring-system made with the\r\nhelp of the spectroscope supports this conclusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Nebulæ.]\r\n\r\n73. Reichenbach, in 1858, before the self-luminosity had been proved\r\nby means of the spectroscope, had imagined a nebula to be a cloud of\r\nisolated meteorites, illuminated by some neighbouring sun: Chladni,\r\nlong before, had supposed a nebula to be a cloud of phosphorescent\r\ndust. But, in 1864, it was established by Sir William Huggins that\r\nthe light is due, not to reflection or phosphorescence, but to\r\nincandescence, for the spectrum consists of bright lines such as are\r\nyielded by glowing gas. Tait,[41] in 1871, suggested that the nebulæ\r\nmay be clouds of mutually impinging meteorites, mingled with glowing\r\ngases developed by the impacts; he pointed out that the heat produced\r\nby the clashing of the individuals of such an immense group as a nebula\r\nevidently is would be quite adequate for the production of their light.\r\nSir Norman Lockyer finds that the bright lines (generally accompanied\r\nby a certain amount of continuous spectrum) which have been observed\r\nin nebular spectra are consistent with this suggestion, and regards\r\nthem as closely related to the low temperature lines obtained when\r\na gentle electric glow is passed over meteorite-fragments in a tube\r\ncontaining gases given out by them, and of which the density has been\r\nreduced by the air-pump; further, he points out that the nebular\r\nspectrum is identical with that of the comets of 1866 and 1867 when\r\ndistant from the sun. According to this suggestion, a nebula and a\r\ncomet are of identical constitution, and a comet is merely a nebula\r\nwhich has become entangled in the solar system. On the other hand, Sir\r\nWilliam Huggins has expressed (1891) the opinion that the spectrum of\r\nthe bright-line nebulæ is certainly not such as we should expect to\r\nresult from the collision of meteorites like those which have reached\r\nthe earth, and that it is suggestive of a high temperature; he points\r\nout that the particles which have just been in collision may be at high\r\ntemperatures and yet the average temperature of all the particles may\r\nbe low.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Stars.]\r\n\r\n74. The examination and classification of the spectra of the stars has\r\nlikewise led to remarkable conclusions. Secchi, following Rutherfurd,\r\nfound that the stars could be distributed into classes according to the\r\ncharacters of their spectra,[42] and his classification has since, with\r\nlittle modification, been adopted by Vogel and Dunér, by whom several\r\nthousand star-spectra have now been systematically mapped. The first\r\nthree classes are characterised by absorption, the fourth by radiation.\r\n\r\nIn the spectra of Class I the absorption is small and simple, the dark\r\nlines being broad and few; the stars themselves are white: in one\r\ndivision of this class, represented by Sirius and Vega, the principal\r\nlines are due to hydrogen; in another important division, represented\r\nby beta, gamma, delta, epsilon, zeta Orionis, lines of helium are very\r\npronounced.\r\n\r\nIn Class II the dark lines are thinner and more numerous; the stars are\r\nbluish-white to reddish-yellow: to this class belong the Sun, Arcturus,\r\nCapella.\r\n\r\nThe absorption in Class III manifests itself predominantly as flutings,\r\nthough there are also many thin lines: the stars are orange or red:\r\nin one division (a) of this class the darkest part and the sharpest\r\nedge of each fluting is towards the violet end of the spectrum, as in\r\nBetelgeux; in a smaller division (b) the darkest part of each fluting\r\nis towards the red end, as in star 152 Schjellerup; the fluting\r\nabsorption of the latter division being due to carbon.\r\n\r\nThe remaining Class IV is an extremely small one: the spectra are\r\ncharacterised by bright lines: some of the lines are due to hydrogen,\r\nand others to substances not yet recognised in terrestrial chemistry.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Supposed cooling of all the stars.]\r\n\r\n75. Soon after the classification suggested by Secchi had been\r\nannounced, it was surmised that the differences in the stars of the\r\nfirst three classes might be due, not so much to differences of matter,\r\nas to differences of temperature, and that a very hot star such as,\r\nfrom its brightness and distance, its small and simple absorption, and\r\nthe development of the blue end of its spectrum, Vega is believed to\r\nbe, would, on getting older and colder, pass from Class I to Class II,\r\nand thence to one or other of the divisions of Class III.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: New stars.]\r\n\r\n76. In 1866 a star of 9th or 10th magnitude burst into greater\r\nbrilliancy and nearly reached the intensity of Vega; the spectrum\r\nshowed the presence of brilliantly glowing hydrogen. Almost as suddenly\r\nthe light went down again, and within a month returned to its original\r\nbrightness. Ten years later, another new star of the 3rd or 4th\r\nmagnitude appeared at a place in the sky where no star had been noticed\r\nbefore; its spectrum showed numerous bright lines; gradually, in the\r\ncourse of a year, it dwindled down to the 10th magnitude, then giving\r\nthe telescopic appearance and the spectrum of a nebula. Several other\r\nnew stars have since been observed, the most notable being Nova Persei,\r\nwhich appeared in 1901. In each case, as the star faded, its spectrum\r\nchanged into that which is characteristic of the nebulæ.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of a new star has been generally attributed to the\r\ncollision of two bodies in space; Sir Norman Lockyer[43] has pointed\r\nout that the rapidity of the change in the brilliancy, so different\r\nfrom that of other stars, may be due to the smallness of the mass,\r\nand that such a star may be produced by the collision of two swarms\r\nof widely separated meteorites. He has shown that the changes in the\r\nspectrum as such a star varies in brightness are confirmatory of this\r\nview.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The heat of the sun.]\r\n\r\n77. That the heat of our own sun was originated by the falling together\r\nof smaller bodies was, until lately, generally acknowledged;[44]\r\nfor the only other conceivable natural cause, known to exist from\r\nindependent evidence, namely, chemical combination, was quite\r\ninsufficient; the greatest amount of heat obtainable from the most\r\nadvantageous chemical combination of any of the then known elements,\r\nhaving a total mass equal to that of the sun, would not cover the sun's\r\nexpenditure for more than three thousand years, while there is no\r\ndifficulty on the meteoritic explanation in providing a supply of heat\r\nsufficient to cover the loss by radiation during 20,000,000 years. But\r\nthe discovery that compounds of radium maintain themselves at a higher\r\ntemperature than that of surrounding bodies and are only inappreciably\r\nchanged though continuously emitting an appreciable amount of heat,\r\nshows that the meteoritic hypothesis as to the cause of the sun's high\r\ntemperature is not necessarily the true one: there may be an analogous\r\nheat-yielding material in the sun.\r\n\r\nIn any case the present loss of the sun's heat by radiation is probably\r\nnot covered by the fall of bodies into the sun; for the requisite mass\r\nwould, if from distant regions, visibly affect the motions of the\r\nplanets by its attraction, and, even if circulating round the sun at no\r\ngreat distance from it, would seriously disturb the motions of some of\r\nthe comets. Further, much heat will result from the shrinkage of the\r\nvolume of the solar aggregate.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Evolution of the heavenly bodies.]\r\n\r\n78. By study of the spectra, at various temperatures, of the elements\r\nand compounds found in those meteorites which have reached our earth\r\nand been preserved, Sir Norman Lockyer[45] has been led to support\r\nthe view that the stars are not at present all cooling down, but that\r\nsome, on the contrary, are rising in temperature; he suggests that many\r\nof the stars, like the nebulæ, are constituted of separate meteorites\r\nin continual relative motion, and become hotter and hotter through\r\ncontraction of the grouping, collision, and transformation of the\r\nenergy of position and motion into heat. This increase of temperature\r\nmust continue during successive ages, until the energy of position and\r\nmotion of the separate meteorites is wholly transformed, the separate\r\nmasses having then combined to form a single white hot body which will\r\ngradually cool down to the state in which our own moon now is. If a\r\nswarm of meteorites forming one nebula be subjected to the external\r\naction of another moving swarm of meteorites, intermediate stages\r\nresembling the conditions of Saturn and of the solar system may ensue.\r\n\r\nAccording to this spectroscopic affirmation of the nebular theory, all\r\nthe heavenly bodies are constituted of the same kinds of elementary\r\nmatter, those in fact which are found in meteorites and our own earth,\r\nand the difference is solely due to temperature; and a nebula in\r\nits gradual passage to the lunar condition will show every phase of\r\nspectrum observed in the stars as now existent.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Meteorites present no evidence of life.]\r\n\r\n79. Finally, it may be asked whether or not meteorites bring us any\r\ntangible evidence of the existence of living beings outside our own\r\nworld. To this we may briefly answer, that while an organic origin can\r\nscarcely be claimed for the graphite present in the meteoric irons,\r\nthere are no less than six meteoric stones which contain, though in\r\nvery minute quantity, carbon compounds of such a character that their\r\npresence in a terrestrial body would be regarded as doubtlessly an\r\nindirect result of animal or vegetable existence. On the other hand,\r\nthe stony matter is such that in a terrestrial body an igneous origin\r\nwould be assumed.\r\n\r\nProfessor Maskelyne has pointed out that these carbon compounds can be\r\ncompletely removed without a preliminary pulverisation of the stone,\r\nand thus seem to be contained merely in the pores; he suggested that\r\nthey may have been absorbed by the stones in their passage through an\r\natmosphere containing the compounds in a state of vapour. In any case,\r\nit is impossible to prove that there is a necessary relation between\r\nthese compounds of carbon and the existence of living beings.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Chondrules have been mistaken for organisms.]\r\n\r\n80. In 1880[46] descriptions were given of sponges, corals, crinoids\r\nand plants, found in several meteorites, chiefly in that of Knyahinya,\r\nbut the memoir has been generally regarded as an elaborate jest. The\r\nchondrules with their excentrically radiating crystallisation are\r\nthere classified and named as sponges, corals and crinoids, while the\r\nstructure of meteoric iron, revealed by the Widmanstätten figures,\r\nis regarded as a result of plant life. There can be no hesitation in\r\nasserting that as yet no organised matter has been found in meteorites.\r\n\r\n\r\n   FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Remarks concerning stones said to have fallen from the clouds both\r\nin these days and in ancient times: by Edward King.

The printed edition also contains some diacriticals\r\nand subscripts that are represented in this e-text as follows;\r\n\r\n   1. A macron is represented by an =, e.g. [=o]\r\n\r\n   2. A breve is represented by a ), e.g., [)c]\r\n\r\n   3. [oe] represents an oe ligature\r\n\r\n   4. A subscript in a chemical formula is surrounded by {}, e.g. Cu{2}Sb\r\n\r\nThe printed edition had the adopted names for meteorites in the various\r\nlists in bold, this e-text has instead reproduced them in upper case.\r\n\r\nIn the printed edition where a numbered section continues onto a new\r\npage the sidenotes from the previous page are sometimes repeated at the\r\ntop of the new page. This e-text instead only repeats the sidenote if a\r\nnew numbered section without a sidenote follows.\r\n\r\nIn one of the list of meteorites the typesetter occasionally used large\r\ncurly brackets (e.g No. 271, 276, 300, 384, 395, 408, 423, 445) to\r\ncollect together the names of multiple falls of meteorites and the\r\nlocation. Instead this e-text has the location following the adopted\r\nname for the meteorite, with the multiple falls listed below without\r\ncurly brackets.\r\n\r\npage   Original text                    Replaced with\r\n\r\nall    Ditto marks                      Repeated the actual text\r\n\r\n66-106 The various lists of             Standardised by placing a\r\n       meteorites were inconsistent     full stop at the end of every\r\n       in the use of a full stop at     place of fall.\r\n       the end of the place of fall.\r\n\r\n68     1750                             1,750\r\n\r\n69     6948                             6,948\r\n\r\n104    1791                             1,791\r\n\r\n112    Batsúra                          Batsura\r\n\r\n114    HAYWOOD COUNTY,                  HAYWOOD COUNTY,\r\n       pseudo-meteorite)                (pseudo-meteorite)\r\n\r\n116    Montauban v ORGUEIL, 406         Montauban v.
