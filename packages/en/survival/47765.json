And therefore hauing none other wayes to recompence the\r\nleast parte of youre curtesie and gentlenesse, thought it best to\r\ngratifie youre worship with such a simple gifte as mine abilitie will\r\nsuffer me to bestow on such a friend. And although Sir this Treatise is\r\nfarre dissonant from youre studyes, yet considering your earnest desire\r\nto knowledge and learning, and agayne pondering the pleasantnesse of\r\nthe matter, thoughte this might be made a recreation for your grauer\r\nstudyes. For when your mind shall bee searching for profound reasons,\r\nand oppressed with deepe cogitations, then taking and reading this\r\nlittle Pamphlet, it will bring a forgetfulnesse vnto your former\r\nweerynesse, and cause a newe delighte vnto your mind: For heerein may\r\nyou see, first the maruellous gouernement of the Bees, through the\r\nonely instincte of nature, as in theyr obedience to their King, and\r\nother officers, in punishing the ydle loyterers, in cherishing the true\r\nlabourers in theyr manner of fighting, with suche like a greate many,\r\nas it is wonderfull to reade, and almost vncredible to beleeue:\r\nsecondly, the liuely effectes and commodities that arise of theyr Honie\r\nand Waxe. And lastly, howe profitable they are for common wealth, and\r\nhowe necessarie for mans vse, I mighte heerespeake muche in the prayse\r\nof the Bee, which all I will omitte, seeyng onely myne intente is to\r\nshewe my selfe myndfull of your good turnes and benefites, desiring you\r\nto take this in good parte, whyche proceedeth from a well willing\r\nminde. And I am sorie that at this presente I had none other matter\r\nmore worthy to haue gratified your worship withall: but that whiche\r\nwanteth in power, aboundeth in good will. Thus troubling your worship\r\nno longer, I commit you to the keeping of the Almightie, praying him to\r\nincrease in you all vertue and godlynesse, and to grant you the long\r\nyeares of Nestor.\r\n\r\n                                                     _Yours most bounden\r\n                                                     Thomas Hill._\r\n\r\n                             [Illustration]\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    The Preface into the instruction\r\n                                of Bees.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough (gentle Reader) I haue not given thee anye labour of mine\r\nowne, but rather haue collected the sayings and writings of manye\r\naunciente authours, yet I trust they shall be well accepted of thee\r\nwithout offence. For as he that setteth forth vnto the view & reading\r\nof all men such knowledge, as by his long study & experience he hath\r\ngotten, is worthy to haue his due reward of commendation: euen so he is\r\nnot to be discommended, who painfully reuoluing the bookes and volumes\r\nof many and diuers ancient writers, reduceth them into one little\r\nTreatise, for the commoditie and profyte of the simple and vnlearned\r\nsorte, for whose onely sakes I haue trauelled in the translation of\r\nthis worthy matter, touching the right vsage and handling of Bees: a\r\nthing very rare, and seldome seene in the Englishe tongue, and yet\r\nverie profitable for a common wealth, and commonlye vsed among the\r\npoore husbandmen, though not in euery poynt as they ought to be, yet\r\naccording to theyr knowledge and experience. But I, to the intente that\r\na further learning mighte be added to their skill, haue so trauelled\r\ntherein, that I trust their knowledge shal be increased, & such as haue\r\nno knowledge at all, may be instructed without any other teaching. I\r\nhaue ioyned this little Treatise vnto my booke of Gardening, for that\r\nmost men do ioyne them both togither, as when they place their Bees in\r\ntheir Gardens, whereas they may with lesse paine and easilier, gather\r\nof the sweete smelling flowers, their Honie, and Waxe. And for all\r\nthese my paynes gentle Reader, I craue nought else of thee, but to giue\r\nme that which of dutie in a maner I ought to haue, for if thou doest\r\nreceyue any commoditie or fruite eyther by this, or by my other\r\nTreatise hereto annexed, whiche hathe to name the Husbandly\r\nconiectures, with sundry rules of Phisicke, then giue me the reward of\r\nthy good report, and friendly accepting of these two Treatises, and if\r\nnot, yet accept mine endeuours in good part, which be meant to do thee\r\ngood. And thus leauing (gentle reader) to trouble thee farther, I\r\ncommit thee to God, who giue thee the furtherance of knowledge, both in\r\nthese and all other needefull artes.\r\n\r\n

propertie, and benifite_\r\n             of the Bees, with the commoditie of their Hony\r\n          and Waxe, whiche serue vnto many good vses, as well\r\n    _in outward as inwarde causes applied, gathered out of_ Plinie,\r\n                 Albertus, Varro, Columella, Palladius,\r\n                   Aristotle, Theophrastus, Cardanus,\r\n                    Guilielmus de Conchis, Agrippa,\r\n                       and diuers other singular\r\n                               Authours.\r\n\r\n\r\n        ¶ Why Bees are named to be creasted or parted betweene,\r\n        or as it were ringed, or rather pleighted. What work the\r\n        swarme newe gathered in the Hiue, first taketh in hande,\r\n        and whether they maye liue after their stings bee gone.\r\n                               Cap.first.\r\n\r\n_Plinie_ nameth Bées Cleft beasts, bicause of the diuision or parting\r\nbetwéene of the head & shoulders: and _Aristotle_ nameth them plighted\r\nor ringed, in that their bodies are diuided with plightes and rings.\r\nAnd most men know, that the Bées haue neyther sinews, bones, fleshe,\r\ngristle, backe-bone, nor fat, but are only created of a certaine\r\nmixture, being a meane betwéen these, and hauing a very few intrailes.\r\nAnd againe, no man néedeth to doubte, but that the Bées be a kinde of\r\nbeasts, greatly to be set by for mans vse, & for mans prouision, are\r\nnourished of the aire, passing throughe the diuided places, which they\r\nby great diligence and care preserue from being stopped, for as soone\r\nas they be stopped, they shortly after die, like as the same we may\r\nlearne, when anye happeneth to fall or light into Oyle, which straight\r\nway after die, throughe the Oyle stopping then their powers. They haue\r\nand fly with foure wings, that they maye the better carrye in their\r\nbellies the stings of reuengement. For when two of them striue togither\r\nin flight, then do they hold and kéep their stings in their mouths by a\r\ngréedy desire, or for eagernesse sake. Now after the seauen starres\r\nnamed _Vergiliæ_, be once risen in sight aboue our horizon, then do\r\nthey hyde them in their proper holes, so that they go seldome after\r\nabroade, vntill the Beanes doe bud, and if they happen to beginne at\r\nany tyme to flye abroade when as a fayre daye moueth them forwarde,\r\nthen slacke they no suche dayes afterwarde, but occupy themselues. And\r\nfirste they prepare and make their combes, which they fashion into apt\r\nhouses, or rather celles of waxe, after this they haue yong, and then\r\nbeginne they to gather hony. They liue also the longer by hauing their\r\nstings, for that once gone, or taken away, they dye forthwith through\r\nthe lacke of their intrailes, whiche they lose togither with their\r\nstings.\r\n\r\n\r\n           ¶ Who first taught the preparation and increasing\r\n                  of Bees, and founde oute the vse of\r\n                             Honny. Cap.ij.\r\n\r\nThe reporte goeth, that one _Aristomachus_ first founde out and taught\r\nthe increasing of Bées, whome _Plinie_ writeth to be so earnest in the\r\nsame, that setting apart al other affayres, he only studied night & day\r\nhow he might best intreate and vse Bées, according to their kinde. But\r\nothers ascribe this inuention to one _Thassius_, who (as they saye)\r\ndeserued no lesse commendation, both for his diligence and skill among\r\nBées: but this he specially followed in the fielde, and that farre from\r\nthe Towne. And of this the common people (as by a nickname) no more\r\nnamed him _Thassius_, but _Agrius_, for his wilde or rather straunge\r\nlife, whiche he then led in the fielde, Whome _Plinie_ also affyrmeth\r\nto haue written a Booke of the increasing and multiplying of Bées. And\r\n_Columella_ ascribeth this inuention, to the inhabitaunts of the hill\r\n(named _Hymetus_) being in the Countrey of _Attica_, for there (saieth\r\nhe,) was one _Ericthonius_, who taught (as men write) the true and\r\nperfect ordering of them. _Plinie_ againe ascribeth the inuention of\r\nHony to one _Aristeus_ a man of _Athens_. _Diodorus Siculus_ in the\r\nsixte Booke of hys workes, writeth, that _Curetes_, a people of\r\n_Creta_, did firste finde out the Hony, _Macrobius_ ascribeth the same\r\nto one _Saturnus_. Others to the _Thessalians_. And many to _Melissus_,\r\nan auntient King of _Creta_, others to _Nassus Liber Pater_, thus\r\nwriting, that _Liber_ hath obtayned the renowne for finding out of\r\nHonnye.\r\n\r\n\r\n               ¶ How Bees do naturally engender. Cap.iij.\r\n\r\nFirste the Bées procéede of Bées, by the actuall doing togyther, after\r\nwhiche they lay egges, sitting vppon them, as the Hens do on their egs.\r\nAnd when they haue sit on them for the space of .xlv. daies, then do\r\nthey hatch their yong ones, whiche yong (at the first) come forth, much\r\nlike to white Worms, except the King, who onely as he is hatched, hath\r\nwings. At the firste time, one of them hatcheth fiue young togither,\r\nthe nexte time fewer, and so fewer & fewer, vntill she commeth to one\r\nat a time, bicause the abundaunce whiche is in them, dothe in the\r\ncontinuaunce of time weaken. In the time of their sitting they make\r\nmuche noise to gette them heate withall. And aboute the sides of the\r\ncombes, be sometimes greater Bées bred, which men for their sound &\r\nnoise do properly name Trumpeters, and they also haue whole hornes, of\r\nwhich come the bastarde Bées. There be also other Bées bigger in body,\r\nmuche-like to the Kings, but they be ydle, and haue no sting, bicause\r\nof the heauinesse of their body. All which kindes, _Guilielmus de\r\nConchis_ didde obserue in the Hyues of a certaine Consull of Rome,\r\nwhiche properly were made of verye thinne and cleare horne. Some write,\r\nthat Bées are also engendred and bredde monstrously, and that contrary\r\nto Nature, without the mutuall coniunction, if that a whole calfe be\r\nburied in the earth, and there lye rotting whiles the wind blow out of\r\nthe Weste, for by that meanes, as writeth _Maro_, doth the same bréede\r\nBées. And not vnlike to this doeth _Cornelius Agrippa_ in his firste\r\nBooke _de Occulta Philosophia_, and _Hiero. Cardanus_ in hys ninth\r\nbooke of Subtilties write, that of a rotten horse do waspes procéede:\r\nof an Asse, Humble bées: of a Mule, hornettes: of the haire of a woman\r\n(hauing then hir motherly courses) Serpents: and of Creuisses (the\r\nshelles plucked off,) Scorpions.\r\n\r\n\r\n            ¶ Of the vnperfect Bees, which men properly name\r\n                         Drone Bees. Cap.iiij.\r\n\r\nThe Drone Bées (as writeth _Plinie_) are vnperfect Bées, without sting,\r\nand the least weary, yet be they verye heauy of body, and slow in doing\r\ntheir businesse. They also doe the seruices and trauells of the true\r\nBées, although the right and perfect Bées doe rule and gouerne them,\r\nyea and put them formost in their laboures, so that if they happen to\r\nbe slow in their doings, then doe the right Bées punish them without\r\npitie. Also these doe helpe the right Bées, so well in their workes as\r\nin their bréeding, for that the multitude of them, cause the more heat\r\nand warmeth togither. And howe muche the greater the multitude of them\r\nshall be, and so muche more will the increase come of the swarme. When\r\nthe hony waxeth ripe, then are the Drone Bées driuen forth, and the\r\nkinde also of these are onely séene abroade in the Spring time.\r\n\r\n\r\n           ¶ Whether the Bees drawe breath, or haue any bloud\r\n                            in them. Cap.v.\r\n\r\nNow some affyrme, that the clouen beasts draw no breth, in that they\r\nhaue not the fan of the hart, which is the lights or lungs, for as they\r\nwrite, nothing without them can breath. But _Aristotle_ writeth, that\r\nthe same is possible among Bées, hauing the sting (although they haue\r\nno bladder) to breath by their sting. And the Bées haue no bloude,\r\nbicause they haue neither hart nor lungs: yet _Plinie_ affirmeth, that\r\nnothing done by nature may be thought or iudged incredible: for the\r\nsame is fully persuaded in wise men, that the Bées haue a certain\r\nliuely moisture, like as the Cuttle in the Sea, which hath a kinde of\r\nynke in it, and is as the iuyce of it, with the whiche the Diers (at\r\nthis day) do make their Purple colour.\r\n\r\n\r\n          ¶ Of the great vtilitie and profite of the Bees vnto\r\n                           mans vse. Cap.vj.\r\n\r\nA great profite ariseth by Bées, if they be set in a conuenient and fit\r\nplace, and that both carefully & wisely guided, as _Plinie_ writeth in\r\nhis xj. booke, where he willeth, that of al other clouen beastes, the\r\nBées to bee principallye cherished, bicause to mans vse they gather a\r\nsubtile and wholsome iuyce, beyng very swéete, and besides they frame\r\nby a maruelous skill and cunning, theyr cotages of waxe vnto mans vse,\r\nthat no workman (be he neuer so ingenious) can do the like. The profite\r\nalso comming by them in a short time, if the weather hindereth not, is\r\nso greate, that they increase in a shorte time into manye swarmes,\r\nwhich swarmes againe increase others, so that the firste swarmes\r\nincreased, they especially thrust forth from them in the moneth of May,\r\nor Iune, by whych meanes they cause a great increase of them. As\r\n_Varro_ affirmeth the same of two head Gentlemen in Spaine, which only\r\nby the means of their Bées, gayned yerely ten thousand pound (but I\r\nrather thinke fiue thousand pounde, which also is very muche) yet here\r\nis to be noted, that the swarmes of syxe yeares olde, doe seldome\r\nencrease after other swarmes of themselues, although in waxe they giue\r\na great yéelde and gayne to the owners.\r\n\r\n\r\n        ¶ Of the great care and diligence of the Bees. Cap.vij.\r\n\r\nFirst certain Bées as the skilfull practisers do write, stand in the\r\nday time at the mouthes of the Hyues, diligently loking to their\r\nbusinesse, like warders placed at the gates of a Castel, that they maye\r\nso defend in safegarde whom they will within. In the night time they\r\nsetle themselues to rest vnto the morning, vntil one of them by humming\r\ntwice or thrice about, doeth so styrre them forward to flye out after\r\nthe other. For if they happen to kéepe themselues in the morning within\r\nthe Hyues, then doth the same declare a tempest to insue that daye. But\r\nbeing a cleare and fayre morning, then do they flye forth and returne\r\nagaine to their Hiues, laden with the substaunce of the floures on\r\ntheir legges, for their businesse, and this especiallye doe the yonger\r\nBées, so that the other Bées besides do eyther carrye the water in\r\ntheir bils, or on the soft mossinesse of the whole bodie. The elder\r\nBées remayning still within, do also folow their businesse, as in\r\ndiligently laying vp, and aptly dressing the same, as they wold dispose\r\ntheir kindely foode. Such as be sluggish & not labouring they\r\ndiligently note, which for their sluggishnes, they bitterly punish to\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nAnd flying abroade in a mightye winde, they maruelouslye stay and guyde\r\nthemselues, by waying their bodyes down with little stones, caryed in\r\ntheir legges. They at the euening comming to rest, do make lesse and\r\nlesse noyse in the hyue, vntill one of them flyeth about, which by a\r\nlike order as he moued them forewarde in the morning, euen so by the\r\nsame noyse and humming doth he procure them to take their rest, and to\r\nbe all silent within the hiue. If the Bées happen to scatter in their\r\nflying abroade, then do they call and gather them togither into a\r\nswarme, by the helpe of making a shrill sounde, eyther with pan or\r\nbason, or other loude cymball. They also followe their king whether\r\nsoeuer he taketh his flight, who beyng wearie, and not further able to\r\nflie, they carrye hym betwéene them.\r\n\r\nWherfore that the king may not often attempte forth with the swarme,\r\nfor feare of loosing them, the skilful practisers wil, the wings of the\r\nkings be broken off. Whiche féeling himselfe thus depriued of his\r\nwings, will not after attempt to flye forth of his boundes, but\r\nremayning still within, will so cause the other Bées to abide\r\ncontinually with him, not leauing the Hiue at any time after. They also\r\nhaue counsels priuily and rulers among them.\r\n\r\nAnd _Aristotle_ declareth the Bées to be the clenlyest amongst all\r\nother beastes, bycause in flying abroad, they shed then their dung from\r\nthem, leaste anye sauour or stincke of their dung be felte in their\r\ncotages or hoales. If these want honny at anye time, then doe they\r\neyther kill, or driue quite away the drone Bées.\r\n\r\n\r\n         ¶ Of the maruellous gouernement of the kings of honny\r\n              Bees, and of the obedience which they vse to\r\n                             him. Cap.viij.\r\n\r\nNature hath not onlye committed hir lawes to bookes, the which men may\r\nlerne by, but hath especially set forth conditions and properties, as\r\nfor an example of the lyke, by the bées, whose kings for doubt of\r\nreuenging, haue by the prouidence of nature no stings. Whereby is to be\r\nvnderstanded, that the kings ruling in power, thorough the lacke of\r\ntheir stings maye be by that meanes the slower to hurt, and offer\r\nreuengemente. Yet some affirme the kings to haue stings, but they\r\nsuppose them not to vse their stings. And of this _Plinie_ maketh a\r\ndoubt whether the king be armed as the other bées, or lacketh a sting.\r\nWhich _Columella_ putteth out of doubt, writing of the king that he\r\nhath no sting, vnlesse any perhappes thinketh that big head as it were,\r\nwhiche the king carrieth in his belly, to be his sting, with the which\r\nat no time they vse to sting or hurt anye. This king only do Bées\r\nreuerence, and honor him in such sort, that any of them is obedient and\r\nvery ready at his bidding, to do whatsoeuer he assigneth them vnto.\r\nAlso this obedience and seruice whiche they vse to their king, they do\r\nnot the same for feare of punishment, but onely of a loue which they\r\nowe vnto him. Yet they punish one another in such sorte, that after\r\ntheir stings be lost, they dye forthwith. _Aristotle_ writeth of two\r\nmaner of kings, the one as he affirmeth to be red, which he iudgeth the\r\nbetter, the other king black of colour, which he confesseth to be\r\nlesser of body, yet howsoeuer the kings be, they are notwithstanding\r\nfar bigger of body, than the honny bées, & haue a brighter and goodlier\r\nhead then the other Bées, yet shorter wings. So that their king created\r\namong them, goeth not any time forth of the hiue, without the whole\r\nswarm folow him. The king flying forth of the hiue at anye time, the\r\nother folow him, in such sort, that eche couet to flie next him, &\r\nioyeth to be séen of the king in office, and whersoeuer the king\r\nsettleth him or resteth, there be other Bées placed like strong holds\r\nor castels about him. About the king also be placed certaine rulers,\r\nwhich wayte vpon him by a dayly aucthoritie, If anye happeneth, as\r\nwriteth _Plinie_, to breake of the kings right wing, then from the king\r\nwill not the swarme after departe, as the like was rehearsed afore.\r\nBesides these, the Bées haue a maruelous order among them, if their\r\nking happen to die, for then they shal bitterly mourne for their king\r\ndeade, and for the lacke of another, as such whiche cannot be guided\r\nand ruled without a king among them, and of this they be in continuall\r\nmourning. So that for the time, they carry no foode into theyr Hyues,\r\nnor flye not forth, but with a sadde bewailyng and humming, after theyr\r\nKing, they heape thicke togyther aboute the deade body, and vnlesse\r\nanother King increaseth by little and lyttle among them, they dye for\r\nhunger. Theyr king laboureth not, but as the other flye foorthe, hee in\r\nthe meane tyme as an exhorter moueth and encourageth forwarde euerye\r\none to hys worke, by his flying aboute in the Hiue.\r\n\r\n\r\n             ¶ What kinde of Bees are beste, and rather to\r\n                           be chosen. Cap.ix.\r\n\r\nIn this point, & for true knowledge of these, doth _M. Varro_ discribe\r\nthose Bées to be best, which be small of body, and diuerse and round,\r\nbycause they be earnest in labour, and make a thinne honny, and better\r\nendure labour, and gather their honny on hilles, but the worser Bées\r\ngather their honny of the garden floures onlye, whiche be somewhat long\r\nof bodye, lyke to waspes. _Virgil_ doth especially commend the small\r\nBées, beyng somwhat long, light, and clenly in their businesse, and\r\nglistering to golde. So that the greater and rounder Bée, is\r\ndiscommended of all writers. Although the fierce Bées are very ill, yet\r\nis their yrefulnesse, a note of the better Bées, whiche may easily be\r\nappeased, by the daylye haunting among them, for if the kepers do often\r\nhandle the Hyues, then do they become gentle in a short time.\r\n\r\nThe Bées also endure if they be diligently loked vnto, for the space of\r\nten yeares, and beyonde this age no swarme can passe, althoughe the\r\nkéepers supplye the Hyues yearelye with yong Bées, in the steade of the\r\nolde deade, for in the tenth yere, in a manner, of the generall death\r\nof them, the vniuersall kinde of the whole Hyue is then consumed. And\r\ntherefore, that thys maye not happen throughe all the Hyues in that\r\nplace you must alwayes increase your Hyues with yong Bées, which\r\ndiligently Hyue in the springtime, or beginning of Sommer, when as the\r\nswarmes be first and newe thrust forth of the Hiues, and so maye the\r\nnumber of your Hiues be encreased. Agayne some wryte, that in the\r\nCountrey of _Pontus_, the beste Bées bée white, bycause they gyue theyr\r\nyéelde of Honnye twyce in a moneth. And _Gulihelmus de couchis_\r\naffirmeth the beste Bées to be aboute _Thermodoon_ in _Capadocia_,\r\nabyding in the Earthe, for that these doe buylde and make a tryple\r\nyéelde of waxe, and giue also aboundaunce of Honny.\r\n\r\nThe foresayde _Varro_, affirmeth those Bées to be in healthe, which\r\noften kepe and be in a swarme togither, that be clenly & can do their\r\nbusinesse and worke alike, and that quicke & light in the same, beyng\r\nneyther hearie nor foule of body, or appearing dustie, such also which\r\nbe not ouerleane of body, and that out of any of their cotages no dead\r\nbées be carried thence, & forth of their Hiues. For all these notes do\r\ndeclare suche like Bées, to be both euill and vnprofytable. _Palladius_\r\ndeclareth, that the best Bées may be knowen by the fulnesse or\r\nemptinesse of their vessels, for if the Hiues be full, then those Bées\r\ndoth he best commende, if the Hiues be nothing so full stuffed, those\r\nBées doeth he greatly dissalowe. And he also praiseth those Bées,\r\nwhiche excelleth or passeth others in the loudnesse of humming, or do\r\nabound in the great haunte of the swarme, not broughte to the Hiues\r\nfrom farre places, so that there maye be such agrement, that they be\r\nnot after feared awaye, with the newnesse of the aire and place.\r\n\r\n\r\n            ¶ Where the Hiues of Bees ought especially to be\r\n                             placed. Cap.x.\r\n\r\n_Aristotle_ willeth the Hiues of Bées in the winter time to be placed\r\nin a warme place, and in the hotte season of Sommer, in a colde place.\r\n_Palladius Rutilius_ in his firste Booke of husbandrie teacheth that\r\nthe fittest place for bées, is that, whiche is in a Garden, not farre\r\nor rather neare to the owners house, which by that meanes suffereth not\r\nthe windes, nor the accesse of théeues or beastes.\r\n\r\nWhich also nourisheth Trées growing on the Northside of the place, the\r\nbetter to defend the cold ayre from them, & cleare springs or faire\r\nriuer water running by. _Columella_ willeth the Hiues to be set open\r\ntoward the south, far from noyse, & haunte of people and beastes,\r\nneyther in a hote nor colde place, for eyther of these do molest and\r\nharme the bées. Also that the hyues stande in the bottome of a valley,\r\nor if not so possible, then placed neare to the valley, the better and\r\neasier for the Bées to bring their foode gathered to their hiues, and\r\nin anye case farre from stincking puddels, ditches, dung-heapes, and\r\nsuch like filthy stinckes, which greatly annoye and endamage the bées\r\nbeyng neare hande to their hiues, _M. Varro_ writing in his second\r\nbooke vnto a huswife of the countrey, willeth hir also to set the Hiues\r\nclose to hir house, and vnder some shed, & that far from the noyse of\r\nformes, whiche is mente from a groue or wood, leaste through the woodde\r\nor groue neare hande, the same may giue a sounding noyse, like to that\r\nwhiche men commonlye name the Eccho, whiche sounde in verye déede the\r\nBées do greatly hate. _Virgil_ willeth bushie trées to be planted and\r\nstand right before their hiues, like as the Peare trée is, the Peach\r\ntrée, the Oake trée, many kyndes of Apple trées, the birche trée, Holy\r\ntrée, the Iuy trée also, not allowed for his goodnesse, but bycause the\r\nsame giueth out muche honny, and al other trées which beare no bitter\r\nfloures. And he willeth these plantes and hearbes to grow neare hande,\r\nas the Rosemary, the red and damaske Rose, the white Lillie, the\r\nViolets, the Flouredeluce, the Organye, the Time, the running Time, the\r\nSauery, swéete Maiorome, the Saffron floure, which coloureth the honny\r\nand maketh it smel swéete, the beane floures, the French beane floures,\r\nthe Mellylot floures, the hearbe Baulme, the white Poppie floures, the\r\nBitonie floures, the Borage and Buglosse floures, and manye other\r\nswéete and wholesome floures, not here named. But the Boxe trée, the\r\nMasticke trée, the dogge or Gatten trée, or as some suppose the long\r\nand high Chéeri trée they greatly hate, for that tasting of the floures\r\nof anye of these, they die forthwyth. _Maro_ wylleth standing waters,\r\nto be neare to their hiues, & so shallow, that smal stones thrown into\r\nthem, may appeare aboue the water, & serue in stéede of bridges for\r\ntheir often recourse to them, & that they may aptly stretch their wings\r\nabroad on the stones, at the heate of the sun. The standings for hiues\r\nought to be thrée foote distant from the ground, & wittily stopped\r\nabout with red clay, least vermine, and Myse créepe into the hiues, and\r\nspoyle the honny combes. The Hiues also oughte to be set a little\r\nasunder the one from the other, least by loking into them, you shake\r\none another by cleauing togither, and so disquiet the bées nexte to,\r\nwhich feare al manner of shaking least the same throw not downe their\r\nweake workes of waxe. And the mouthes of the hiues ought to stand\r\nsomwhat stiper than the back part, leaste rain beating in, might not\r\nlightly run out again by their entry or hole. For remedy of the which,\r\nsome make a couer ouer theyr hole the better to kéepe off the weather &\r\nraine. And no manner of heate so much harmeth them, as doth the bitter\r\ncold, & for this the faces of hiues ought to be toward the winter\r\nrising of the sun, that the Bées may so receiue the warme comfort, in\r\nthe morning comming forth, & be the liuelier, for colde doth cause them\r\nto be sluggish, and for that cause their holes ought to be very narrow,\r\nthat as little colde as is possible, may enter into them, and so\r\nnarrowe made, that the Bées within may receiue the encrease but of one\r\nBée at once, For by that meanes can neither the Béetil, butterflie, nor\r\ngreat moath enter, to annoye them. Besides for their often recourse\r\nhome, _Maro_ willeth to make two or thrée commings into the hiue,\r\nsomewhat distant asunder.\r\n\r\n\r\n           ¶ What things Bees doe chiefly abhorre, or greatly\r\n                             hate. Cap.xj.\r\n\r\nTo bées, is that (named the Eccho) vngratefull or much displeasing,\r\nwhich as _Plinie_ writeth, doth greatly fear them, through the straunge\r\nsounde rebounding againe, and the miste also doth muche molest and\r\ntrouble them, besides the spinner through hir web hanging downe before\r\nthe Hiue, and the sluggishe butterflie (which _Plinie_ nameth\r\ndishonorable) that is two wayes pestiferous, as the one, when he\r\nspoyleth the waxe, and dungeth within the Hiue, and the other, breading\r\nMagottes or little wormes within the combes. They greatly hate oyle,\r\nlike as all the kindes of the other Bées doe, and a stinking sauoure,\r\nwhich euidently appeareth by that kind of herbe named Mugworte, that\r\nthey especially hate, bycause the same is of a strange stincke to them.\r\nThe hornettes also of the like sorte creast, but bazer of kynde, they\r\ngreatlye feare, for that to the Hornets the Hony Bées are a speciall\r\nfoode. Also they be meate to swallows, to sparrowes, and to all other\r\nsmall byrdes.\r\n\r\nThe frogs besides, they do greatly feare, which only lye in waite for\r\nthem, both in Marishes, running springs, shallowe waters, and little\r\nditches, and the like doe the Toades lye in wayte for the Bées, whiche\r\ndestroye manye of them. And the shéepe doe greately trouble the Honnye\r\nBées, if so be they happen to fall or lighte into the Wooll of theyr\r\nbackes, out of whyche, they cannot easylye wynde or gette themselues\r\nagaine.\r\n\r\nAnd if any happeneth to boyle or seathe Riuer Creauisses, or sea\r\nCrabbes neare to the Hiues, and that the Bées féele the sauour therof,\r\nthey die forthwith.\r\n\r\n\r\n              ¶ By what signes men may know, when the hony\r\n                Bees are diseased, and how men may cure\r\n                             them. Cap.xij.\r\n\r\nThis is a speciall argument and note, that the Bées, are diseased, if\r\nthat they fly scattering in the swarme, if they kéep not their proper\r\ncolour, but be (as it were) of a strange and contrarie colour: if they\r\nalso are ouer leane, if they appeare dustie and hairy, and that out of\r\ntheir cottages bée dead Bées carryed thence. When al these notes and\r\nsignes are espied in the Bées, it is then highe time to séeke remedye\r\nfor them, leaste helpe (by longer running) be sought too late. Therfore\r\n_Palladius_ willeth to minister the kernels of _Pomegranats_, brused\r\nand mixed with swéete and pleasaunt Wine, and the same powred into the\r\nchanels or gutters of halfe canes, set nere to the mouths of hiues, or\r\nhonny, with Rose leaues well beaten togither, and so ministred to them,\r\nor the berries of the Saruice trée brused, and mixed with Honny: for\r\nlacke of these helpes, a man may make a smoake of drie Oxe or Cowe\r\ndung, whiche smoake muche delyghteth and comforteth them, so that the\r\nsame be often vsed vnto Haruest.\r\n\r\nBut if throughe the Maggots or little wormes of the Butter-flyes the\r\nBées be diseased, _Rutilius_ then iudgeth it beste, to set a brasen\r\nCandlesticke, or suche like vessell, with lighte burning in it at\r\nEuening, within the hyue, that to the same light (the Butter-flyes\r\ngathering, and flying about) may so fall down into it, and be destroyed.\r\n\r\n_Aristomachus_ writeth, that the diseased Bées maye bée couered in this\r\nmaner, if that all the corrupt combe within the hiue be taken forth,\r\nand freshe foode anewe put in of the whole, and the hiue after smoaked\r\nwithin. Also he affyrmeth, that Rosemarie sodden with water and honny\r\ntogither, and beyng colde, poured into halfe canes or Elder stickes,\r\nmade hollow like gutters, and the same set by the mouthes of the hiues,\r\nfor the Bées to drinke on, doth recouer the Bées again. _Hyginius_\r\naffirmeth that eyther the Oxe or mans vrine set in like manner (as\r\naboue saide) by the mouths of the hyues, doth also recouer the diseased\r\nBées. Nowe all these, and suche like muste the kéeper of the Bées doe,\r\nwhiche is bothe sober and chaste, and féedeth not vppon sowre or tarte\r\nmeates, nor filthy or strong of sauour, nor any salt meates.\r\n\r\n\r\n              ¶ What manner of person, the keeper of Bees\r\n                         ought to be. Cap.xiij.\r\n\r\nThe Bées for that they muche abhorre all filthye stinkes and smells,\r\n_Palladius_ willeth the kéeper of them to eschewe dilligently al strong\r\nand yll smelling sauoures, one also that delighteth to be chaste of\r\nbody, and frée from filthinesse, among these not breathing sowrely, or\r\nof a stinking breath, not sweating, nor sauouring of sweat, not one\r\nbesides of wicked conditions, or suche a person as standing among the\r\nflight of the Bées, doth not earnestly moue and procure them to fly to\r\nhim, or as one stinged endeuoreth to defend himselfe from them, but\r\nrather as a flatterer among his acquaintance, and children, hath\r\nlearned to entreate, and please the Bées by a more gentle manner. He\r\nalso whiche mindeth to haue also in a readinesse the hiues vnto his\r\nvse, in which he may receiue forthwith the rude youth of the swarmes\r\nput forth, which if they be not diligently preserued, they flye quite\r\nawaye at the full heate of Sunne. But how these hiues ought aptly to be\r\nprepared, shall hereafter bée taught in the sixtéenth Chapiter.\r\n\r\nIf the Dorre Bées, or Bées without sting, be ouer manye in the Hiue,\r\nand that you woulde gladly ridde them forth, then do on this manner:\r\nfirst take and plucke off the wings of one of those Dorre Bées, which\r\nlay or put within the Hiue, and incontinent the Honny Bées espying the\r\nsame, will fal vppon the other Dorre Bées, and both kill and driue them\r\nquite away.\r\n\r\n\r\n          ¶ By what subtil meanes, the swarmes come forth, may\r\n                 be preserued from flying quite awaye.\r\n                               Cap.xiiij.\r\n\r\n_Palladivs_ in his second Booke writeth, that the swarms of the honny\r\nBées fly awaye especiallye in the moneth of Iune. But with vs the same\r\noftner happeneth in the moneth of May, as hathe bin noted by sundrye,\r\ndiuerse times, especially if the yong Bées be sounde and hartie within\r\nthe Hyues. Therefore the kéeper muste diligently looke to the Hyues,\r\nand at no time be absent, especially when the young Bées increase and\r\nabound in the Hyues, for if they be not then carefully looked vnto, and\r\nstayed by the diligence of the kéeper, they al fly quite away. For such\r\nis the nature and propertie of the Bées, that as soone as the swarms of\r\nthe yong Bées, are bred with the Kings, and that they be strong & able\r\nto flye away, then as disdayning the swarms of the olde Bées, they\r\nséeke the more gouernment. For that they be suche liuing things, that\r\ndelight to rule alone, not séeking ayde and counsell of the elder Bées:\r\nand therefore do the newe kings flye forth, with the young swarmes\r\nfollowing them, which for a day or two before their flying away,\r\nremaine heaping togither before the mouths of the Hyues, & right vnder\r\nthe Hiues, so that by their comming forth, and heaping in suche order,\r\nthey properly shewe the desire of a newe place, and be as yet contented\r\nto remaine thereabout, if so be the kéeper prouide for them a place and\r\nan apt Hiue. But if they haue no kéeper to looke diligently to them,\r\nthen as it were by an iniurie repulsed, they after séeke a newe place.\r\nThat this may not happen, let then the warye and diligent kéeper, looke\r\ncircumspectlye to the Hyues in the Spring time, aboute the eight houre\r\nof the daye, (when as the swarmes are not yet flowen away,) that he\r\nmaye the diligenter marke and sée the flying oute and comming in of the\r\nyong Bées.\r\n\r\nNow the readinesse of the Bées in flying away, is known two waies, as\r\nthe first is, when for certaine daies before, in a maner at the setting\r\nof the Sun, they plentifully or abundantly gather on a heape righte\r\nbefore the mouthe of the Hyue, like vnto greate clusters of Grapes, and\r\ndoe hang togither on heapes one vpon another.\r\n\r\nThe other note is, that when they be minded within thrée daies after to\r\nflye awaye, they make as meruellous noise and sturring too and fro\r\nwithin the hiues at euening, as Souldiours at the Alarme within a\r\nCastell, whiche you maye easilye knowe, (this readinesse of them) if\r\nthat you lay your eare to ech hiue. And when some of the Bées are\r\nflowen awaye, then doe those waite for the others, vntill the whole\r\nswarme be come togither. That the Bées fly not awaye, _Plinie_ teacheth\r\nin the .xj. Booke of his Naturall Historie, that the hiues ought to be\r\nannointed about with the iuyce of the herb named Balme. Also other\r\naffyrme, that the swarme to settle and stay againe through the onely\r\nthrowing of fine duste on them, if so be the same be throwen on light,\r\nand that ouer the bées. Some beside affirme, that the Bées will not\r\nflye awaye, if that the dung of the first calfe of any Cowe, be smeared\r\nabout the mouths of the hiues. _Plinie_ writeth, that by the only\r\nbinding of the fresh white Vine (running in hedges) rounde about the\r\nbodies of the Hyues, it stayeth the swarme from flying away.\r\n\r\n\r\n            ¶ Of the Bees newe settled in a swarme togyther,\r\n                     and taken or recouered agayne.\r\n                                Cap.xv.\r\n\r\nWhen the Bées are nowe in a tumulte in the ayre, by throwing fine earth\r\non high ouer the Bées, or ringing a basen or kettle, they be with the\r\nshrill sound made astonied, that they maye the sooner settle downe\r\nneare to the kéeper, whiche if the same happen to be on the branch of a\r\ntrée, or on a graft or yong set, then with a very sharpe sawe, gently\r\nsawe that off, and laye it on the grounde, and spéedily set a Hiue on\r\nthe same prepared for the purpose. For by that meanes (without doubte)\r\nwill the whole swarme flye vp to the toppe and head of the Hiue. Yet it\r\noften happeneth, that they doe not wholy cleaue on a heape to the\r\nbraunch of a trée, but to the stocke or body of the trée, whych by that\r\nmeanes muste néedes be cutte by a greater force, so that not able to be\r\nrecouered by this meanes, the swarme muste be quickly swéepte off,\r\neither with the hand, or with a Gose wing, that they may so fall\r\ntogither into the hiue. If the swarme happen to be clustred togither on\r\nthe top of a trée, so high, that they cannot be climed vnto, to take\r\nthem downe, then after the shaking of them into the Hiue (turned vppe)\r\neither with a pole or high forke, the hiue must spéedily be turned down\r\nto the earth. And if they be not thus taken or recouered, yet if the\r\nKing shal be still in the Hiue, then doth the swarme fly in againe, if\r\nhe remayneth not, then wil none of the swarme abide in the hiue, but\r\nflye forthwith vnto the former place. Wherfore, that they may be moued\r\nto abide, you muste then sprinckle the hiue with water and hony\r\ntogither, and couer the same within with the gréene Nettle, or rather\r\nthe gréene Fennell, or some such swéete herbe, annointed a little with\r\nHony, and after set at the Euening in their proper place. For the hiue\r\nin the day time, after the recouering thus of the Bées, may not be\r\nstirred vntil the Euening, that the Bées so quietly resting all that\r\nnight, may in the morning leisurely go forth. But for thrée daies\r\ntogither in a manner, muste the kéeper dayly looke, whether the swarme\r\nkéepeth belowe in the Hiue, for if it doth, then are the Bées purposed\r\nto flye awaye. And if none of al these remedies, may yet moue the Bées\r\nto stay and tarry in the hiue, then be-smoke the hiue with flaxe, and\r\nthey will after enter in and abide in the hiue. Which so staying in the\r\nhiues, set at the Euening in his proper place. Here learne a farther\r\ninstruction, that if the swarme of Bées cannot be gathered and\r\nrecouered togither all at one time then may you gather the swarme at\r\ntwo or more times togither, and alwaies put eche part gathered vnder\r\nthe hiue. If it happeneth that you haue gotten the King, with a part of\r\nthe swarme, then will all the others soone come to hiue (without\r\nfurther trauaile) of their owne accorde. If the Bées also be entred\r\ninto the hollowe of a trée, then to the hole, whiche they vse to go in\r\nand out at, as their proper doore, sette a prepared hiue, and beneath\r\ntheir hole, neare to the roote and bottome of the hollow (as you can\r\ngesse) boare another bigge hole, that ye may wel put in a smoke of\r\nBrimstone to them, whiche may so cause all the Bées to fly out at their\r\nhole into the Hiue, set ouer the mouth of it. For no better deuise or\r\ninuention can be had in this matter, than by such a smoake made. If the\r\nsame hollowe trée be so thinne, that it may easily be sawed asunder,\r\nthen with a sharpe sawe lette that hollowe parte be cutte asunder,\r\nbothe aboue and beneath, and after couering it with a cleane shéete,\r\ncarrie the swarme home, which at euening couer with a newe Hiue\r\nsprinckled with water and honny mixed togither. For so they will tarrye\r\nthe willinglier, being all shaken forth of the body of the trée, and\r\ncouered with the Hiue. Besides the hearbe Mugworte (whiche the Bées by\r\na naturall hatred do abhorre) doth chase them with the onely smell from\r\nplace to place.\r\n\r\n\r\n             ¶ Which are the best and fittest Hiues for the\r\n                          Honny Bees. Cap.xvj.\r\n\r\n_Palladivs_ writeth, that the best Hiues be those, which are made of\r\nthe barkes and light corke of trées, bicause they be neither too colde\r\nin the Winter time, nor too hote in the Sommer. And of this, those\r\nHiues whiche be wroughte and made of the small Osier or Willow trée, or\r\nof the Vine stickes knit togither, or Canes cleft in the middes (whiche\r\nbe of like condition to the barke) wroughte close togither, and stopped\r\nclose aboute wyth flockes and clay, tempered togither with water and\r\nsalte, may aptly serue, if you will. But if neither of those fashioned\r\nHiues like you, then may you make the Hiues of the woodde of a hollowe\r\ntrée, or of light bourdes made square, and stowpyng somewhat afore. The\r\nworste Hiues be those, which be made of turfes or earth, bycause they\r\nbe ouer hote in the Sommer, and ouer colde in the Winter. There be\r\nother two kinds of hiues, as the one made of drie hard Cow dung, and\r\nthe other of tiles. Of whiche the one doth _Celsus_ rightly condemne,\r\nbycause the same is so lightly burned, and the other he alloweth,\r\nalthoughe he dissembleth the speciall commoditie of it, bycause the\r\nsame, if néede requireth, cannot easily be remoued and carried into an\r\nother place. And among these, I suppose oure forme of Hiues here in\r\nEnglande, are not altogither to be disallowed, although they be in like\r\ndaunger, to be easily burned, as the other Hiues aboue taughte, in that\r\nthey be made with strawe. But to be briefe, for a greate swarme you\r\nought to haue in a readinesse a greate hiue, and for a small swarme a\r\nlittle Hiue. And the Hiue also oughte to be a foote and a halfe, or two\r\nfoote high, and in breadth aboue two foote and a halfe, or somewhat\r\nlarger. Hauing besides two very small and narrowe holes, somewhat\r\nasunder, and so little ought the mouths to be, that neyther Béetle,\r\nButterflie, gret Moth, Humble Bées, Euet nor Mouse may enter in, to\r\nspoile the Honny combes. Some suppose, or rather affyrme of experience,\r\nthat the Bées are delighted with this closenesse, in that they more ioy\r\nto do their works and businesse in the darke, than otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\n      ¶ Of the clenlinesse and sweetenesse of the keeper of Bees,\r\n             and howe Hiues ought to be fenced aboute, and\r\n                       prepared within. Cap.xvij.\r\n\r\nThe kéeper of Bées which mindeth to handle and looke into hiues, ought\r\nthe day before to refraine the veneriall acte, not a person fearefull,\r\nnor comming to the hiue with vnwashed handes and face. And one that\r\noughte to refraine in a manner from all smelling meates, poudered\r\nmeates, fryed meates, and all other meats that doe stinke, like as the\r\nLéekes, the Onions, the Garlike, and suche like, whiche the Bées\r\ngreatlye abhorre. Besides, to be then swéete of body, and clenly in\r\napparell, minding to come to their hiues, for in all clenlinesse and\r\nswéetnesse the Bées are muche delighted. Nowe thus prepared & in a\r\nreadinesse, open the hiues first of the Bées, about the .viij. or .x.\r\nday of Aprill, being then a cleare & warme day, & purge the hiues of\r\nall such filth which be gathered in them all the winter before, like as\r\nSpiders webs, which oughte especially to be wiped awaye, bicause they\r\ncorrupt the combes, not with hands, but with a goose wing, the same\r\nought to be done. After that, the Hiue oughte to be smoaked with Oxe or\r\nCowe dung, for in that (as it were, by an affinitie of the kinde) do\r\nthe Bées greatly delight. The little wormes also, whiche some name\r\nMaggots, that bréede in the combes, throughe the blowing of the\r\nButterflies, and also the Butter-flyes ought to be killed and purged\r\noute of the hiue. If the combes happen to fall throughe infection or\r\ncorruption in them, then make a smoake with the drie dung and marowe of\r\nan Oxe or Cowe mixed togither, that the sauour may go vppe to them,\r\nwhiche for that time will cure the weake combes, strengthen the Bées, &\r\ncause them to worke the lustier afterward. And from the beginning of\r\nMay, vnto the last of Iune, the hiues ought then to be diligently\r\nlooked vnto, that the yong swarmes flye not away. Also from the tenth\r\nof Iune, vnto the tenth of August, the hiues ought to be opened now &\r\nthen, & to be smoked with such like as afore is taught. Whiche\r\nalthoughe it be grieuous for the time to Bées, yet the same is very\r\nprofitable, and strengthneth them. And from the beginyng of the Dog\r\ndayes, vnto the eightéenth of September, ought the Bées to be carefully\r\nlooked vnto and defended, from the violence of the Hornet Bées, which\r\noften awaite before the mouthes of the Hiues, to set vppon and eate the\r\nHonny Bées. Nowe the kéeper in a fayre sunny daye, ought to clense the\r\nHiues of al maner annoyances as before is taught, and diligently to\r\nstop the chincks, or clefts about, sauing the mouthes of the Hiues,\r\nwith Oxe dung & clay mixed togither. And this ought to be done, for two\r\nor thrée daies before the change of the Moone, the better to defend the\r\nButter flye and others, from créeping in. The Hyues besides ought to\r\nhaue two bigge stickes cleane scraped, and running a crosse from side\r\nto side, and sprinckled rounde about within, and swéete and pleasant\r\nwine, or else the stickes to be harde rubbed ouer, with the gréene\r\nbraunches of the Fennell or other swéete smelling herbs, or with a\r\nlittle hony & leaues of the Pere-trée, togither, or with the branches\r\nof the herb Time flouring, or Sanerie, or Maiorame, or the hearbe\r\nBalme, and Honny togither. Some annoint the stickes and hiue within,\r\nwith the swéete creame of the newe Cowe milke, or with Water and Honnye\r\nsodden togither, and that sprinckled aboute within the Hyue, that the\r\nBées maye be the rather and sooner moued to tarrie and dwell stil in\r\nthe Hiues.\r\n\r\n\r\n         ¶ How Bees lacking honnie may be fedde in that present\r\n                           neede. Cap.xviij.\r\n\r\nBycause the boysterousnesse of the ayre doth sometimes constraine the\r\nBées to abyde in their hiues, and that they may not only féede of\r\nHonny, but at the rysing of the constellation (named _Vergiliæ_) they\r\nmaye be fed and cherished, and the same done in this manner without\r\ngreate cost. As firste, if you take the number of ten figges, séething\r\nthem in sixe pintes of fayre conduite or spring water, vnto a pynte\r\nwasted, whych after set the one side of the hiue within, laying many\r\nsmal stickes a crosse ouer the Lycour, that those may serue in stead of\r\nbridgs, the apter for them to drinke of the Licour, without drowning in\r\nthe same. Others wyll to séeth Honny and water togither, & the same to\r\nbe poured into dishes set at the one side of the Hiue, in the whiche\r\nthey will to put fine carded wooll, that the Bées maye the better\r\ndrincke now and then, and be not cloyed with too much drinking of the\r\nlicour, by lighting into it. Others take figs & raisons beating them\r\ntogither, and after boyling them in the swéete lycour named Cuyte, they\r\npoure into dishes, couering the same with Oaten strawes a crosse.\r\nOthers also will to take a little Hony, putting into the same a fewe\r\nOate cornes, that the Bées lighting on them, maye so kepe their wings\r\nfrom wetting in the licour. Now all these meanes may well suffise to\r\ncherish and féed the bées in the Winter time, lacking then foode, beyng\r\nset neare to the mouthes of the Hiues. So that if a longer hunger\r\noppresseth them, then with the hiues fast by the entring in, set little\r\ngutters made of halfe canes, or greate elder stickes cleft, into which\r\npoure of the swéete licours aboue taught, for by that meanes may they\r\nbe wel recouered and strengthned in the déepe of Winter, when their\r\nfoode fayleth them. Some wil to put fresh birdes cleane drawne, or the\r\nfleshe of a Henne finely shred into hiues, for the Bées to féede and\r\nsucke vpon in the déepe of Winter, & the fine feathers also they will\r\nput into the Hiue, that they may giue then a warmth to the Bées lying\r\nin them. And others also will to put the meate of rosted Chickens into\r\ntheir Hiues, to féede and sucke vppon, and not the boanes withall,\r\nleast the sauour of the bones after the meate eaten off, might annoy\r\nthe bées by lying still in the hiues, in that they so greatly abhorre\r\nall sowre and stinking sauors. Also these kinds of flesh ordered (as\r\naboue sayde) may well serue the Bées in another drie Sommer, when as\r\nthe most floures are then faded or quite gone away. Here note, that in\r\nthe Spring and Sommer time, the bée-hiues ought to be loked vnto thrice\r\nin the moneth, gently smoking the Bées, to clense the Hiues of al maner\r\nfilth, and to swéepe forth the wormes. Also _Menecrates_ willeth the\r\nkéeper of Bées, to kill the king blacke of colour, whiche by hys malice\r\ndisquieteth the other king, and corrupteth the Hiue, in that he flieth\r\nout alone, or with a company of the bées folowing. So by that meanes\r\n(as _Virgil_ writeth) shall the battel of Bées be stayed. _Palladius_\r\nwriteth, that the swarmes be increased in the moneth of May, and that\r\nin the outmost sides of the combes be the drone Bées bred, which ought\r\nto be killed, in that those do muche disquiet the rest of the swarme.\r\nThe Butterflies also do abounde, which he willeth diligently to kill,\r\nfor their greate annoyaunce to the honny Bées.\r\n\r\nAbout the beginning of Nouember ought the Hyues then to be cleared of\r\ntheir filth, so that al the Winter following they may neyther be\r\nremoued nor opened. And this may not be done but in a warme sunny daye,\r\nthe combes maye not be touched with hands, but with the feathers of a\r\nstiffe goose wing, or such bigge foule. After that to stoppe the\r\nchinkes round about wyth Oxe dung and clay finely laboured togither,\r\nand to lay strawe thicke ouer the toppes of the Hiues, the better to\r\ndefende the Bées from the cold and tempestes.\r\n\r\n\r\n              ¶ How the dead Bees may be restored to life\r\n                            againe. Cap.xix.\r\n\r\nThe kéeper of bées ought to foresée and take héede, that the Bées\r\nperysh not through ouer great heate, or ouer mighty cold. If at any\r\ntime by a sodaine showre in the séeking for foode, Bées happen to be\r\nbeaten downe, or nipped wyth a sodaine colde (which seldome so commeth\r\nto passe that the Honny bées are so deceyued,) that harmed with the\r\ndroppes, they lye grouelyng and flatte on the earth, as dead in a\r\nmanner, then gather the Bées togyther, putting them into some vessel\r\nfor the nonce, which after set in a warm chamber or Parloure, & couer\r\nwarm ymbers, being somewhat more than hote, on the Bées, whiche gently\r\nshake with the ashes, but in suche sorte that you touche them not wyth\r\nyour hande. And setting the Bées in the sunne, and neare to their\r\nhiues, they will after recouer, and flie again into their cotages.\r\n\r\n\r\n             ¶ Of the battel that Bees sometime haue among\r\n                          themselues. Cap.xx.\r\n\r\n_Vergill_ writeth, that the Bées sometimes minding to fighte, do\r\nhastily brust out of the Hiues, and as it were in ciuill battels among\r\nthemselues, do fight lyke strangers one against the other, & smite\r\neagerly in their fight one at an other. If so be one hyue hath\r\nespecially two kings bred vp in the same, whych very well may be\r\nknowne, when as the bées clustered and heaped togither, doe represente\r\nor represse as it were the forme of two beardes hangyng downe. Now\r\ntheyr readinesse to fight is knowen, when in the ayre is heard a greate\r\nsounde and noyse among the Bées lyke to the manner of Trumpets, whiles\r\nthey fiercely and cruelly fighte togither among themselues, & in this\r\nbattell they glitter with the wings, sharpen the stings with their\r\nbeakes, beare forth their breastes, and about the king they gather and\r\nswarme. So that they shoute wyth great noyse, flying and dashing\r\ntogither, and that in heapes and rounde companies mixed or ioyned\r\ntogither, and greate is the noyse made among them. And to be shorte, in\r\nthis strong and eager battell, many of them fal headlong downe, and\r\nthat thicker then haile stones to the ground.\r\n\r\nThe kings themselues in the meane time flying in the middel frontes,\r\ndoe fight with a fierce courage within themselues, and they also are\r\nséene to flie hither and thither among thicke heapes and swarmes of the\r\nBées, (like as valiaunte Capytaines are wont to do in the time of a\r\nbattell) with their glistering wings and beakes, beating downe of the\r\nswarmes, here & there and on eche side of them, of both partes. So that\r\nof themselues not giuyng ouer this eager battell, untill the one part\r\nbe forced to turne the backe to the other, and flye away with\r\nexpedition. Therfore that this doubtful battel in the meane time may be\r\nceased and quieted betwene them, the wise practisers wyll that the\r\nkéeper of Bées, do staye and appease this broyle of them, by the\r\ncasting of fine earth ouer the Bées, whiles they be thus fighting,\r\nwhich (as the wise affirme) of experience doth forthewith pacifie the\r\ngreat stomackes and courages of both partes. But if this auayleth not,\r\nthen with honny and water sodden togither, or raysons in like order, or\r\nwith any other swéete licour sprinckled on them, is their furie\r\nappeased, whiche doth as it were with the pleasaunt swéetenesse, quiet\r\nthe irefulnesse of the warriours, and wyth the same in this\r\ncontrouersie they are maruelously appeased. If neyther of these\r\nremedies do yet preuaile, then let the keper marke diligentlye those\r\nBées whyche fyghte in the fronte, and bee moste eager Capytaines, that\r\nhee maye kill them with expedition, for by that meanes, and with the\r\nother remedies aboue taughte, maye the battels and fight of the\r\nwariours be throughly ceased.\r\n\r\nNow after the Bées are thus quieted, and the swarme setled rounde on\r\nsome gréene bowe nexte hande, then marke whether the whole swarme\r\nhangeth downe like a cluster of grapes, whiche so séeing, declareth\r\nthere to bee eyther one king or two, by good agréement reconciled,\r\nwhiche let alone on such wise, vntil they flye backe vnto their proper\r\nhome. But if the swarme shal be deuided into two or many round\r\nclusters, then iudge that there be yet manye Captaynes lefte, and that\r\ntheir yre is not ceased: and in those partes, where you especially sée\r\nthe bées to cluster moste thicke and rounde togyther, there diligently\r\nséeke out the Captaynes. Yet annoynt your hand before with the iuyce of\r\nthe hearbe Baulme, that touching or handling the Bées, they flye not\r\nhither and thither, after which put in your fingers gently, and\r\nseuering the Bées asunder, seke diligently among them, vntil you finde\r\nout the author and procurer of the battell, whiche you oughte likewise\r\nto kill. _Vergill_ writeth, that the kings sometimes fly forth for a\r\nvaine delight, to sport them flying in the aire, which you may easily\r\nstay and let, if that you pluck of the kings wings, that he cannot\r\nafterward flye.\r\n\r\n\r\n            ¶ How Bees, may be recouered and founde againe.\r\n                                Cap.xxj.\r\n\r\nIf it so happeneth that bées are flowen away, & that you be in doubte\r\nwhether they be lodged neare hande, or farre off, _Palladius_ doth\r\ninstructe and teache many goodly wayes to finde them againe. First he\r\nteacheth to take red leade, or red Oker infused in water, or any other\r\ncolour, stayning, and to carry the same wyth you in a little shallow\r\ndishe. Vnto suche a spring or running water as the honny bées haunte,\r\nespecially in the moneth of Aprill. And there sitting downe, awayte the\r\ncomming of the Bées to drinke, which after they be come, and there\r\ndrinkyng, stayne in the meane whiles such bées, with your rush coloured\r\nredde at the ende, as you may well retche with the same, sitting yet\r\nstil, and watching the comming againe of those Bées marked to drinke,\r\nwhiche if they shortlye returne, then is it an euidente note and token,\r\nthat their lodging and cottages be neare hande, but if those Bées are\r\nlong before they returne and come againe to the place, then maye you\r\nsuppose and iudge them to be farre off, and the distaunce you may\r\ngesse, according to their long tarrying and soone comming againe. That\r\nyou maye easily finde the place where the Bées lodge, whether the same\r\nbee farre or neare hand, _Palladius_ teacheth the same wittily in this\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nFirste he willeth to take one whole ioynt of a bigge cane or Elder\r\nsticke stopped at the one end, and the other end left open, to annoynt\r\nwithin, with a little honny, whiche laye neare to that spring or\r\nrunning water, that the Bées daylye haunte vnto.\r\n\r\nWhen Bées resort to the same, and that certayne be entred within the\r\nquil through the sauor thereof, then stop the hole with your thumb,\r\nletting one of the Bées afterward to flye forth, whiche dylygently\r\nmarke, and follow that way it flyeth, for it wyll shewe you part of the\r\nway to their home. And after you can sée the same no further, then\r\nquicklye set forth another bée, whose flight in like manner marke, and\r\nfollowe after, for that it maye also shewe parte of the way vnto their\r\nhome. And so let flie the bées by one and one, vntil they bring you\r\nvnto the place of the swarme. Nowe if the same place be déepe in the\r\nearthe, then with a smoake made eyther of drye flaxe or Brimstone,\r\ndriue the Bées out, and when the swarme is come forthe, then ring on a\r\nbason or shrill panne, for being by and by feared with the shryll\r\nsounde of the same, the swarme eyther lighteth on a yong trée, or on\r\nthe opener bowe of a bigge trée, which so founde out, couer ouer with a\r\nhiue prepared for the nonce. But if the swarm be placed in the hollowe\r\nof a trée, and hauing bowes, or in the stocke of the same trée, then\r\nwith a verye sharpe sawe (if the meanes of the same will giue leaue)\r\ncutte it asunder. And in such sort, that the parte emptie aboue the\r\nbées be first cut, and the parte beneath it which it séemeth the Bées\r\nto be lodged, to be like cut asunder, and the stocke thus cut asunder,\r\nat both the endes, couer with a faire shéete, leaste any large cliftes\r\nappeare after the cutting, whiche also annoynt with honnye, for the\r\nbetter staying in of the bées, and after carrye the same home, which\r\nplace by your other hiues making smal holes in the same, for theyr\r\nflying in and out (as afore was taught) in the ordering of the other\r\nhiues. But it behoueth the diligent sercher, to chose the morning times\r\nfor the finding out of Bées, wherby you may haue the space & libertie\r\nof the day before you, to finde out the resort of Bées. For by loking\r\nlate after them, it falleth out so, that although the Bées are neare\r\nhande, yet bycause they haue then done their busie and careful laboure,\r\nthey flye no longer abrode to séeke foode, nor yet resorte to drinke.\r\n\r\nThroughe whiche it so commeth to passe, that the searcher after Bées\r\nknoweth not then howe neare, or far off, the swarm is from the spring\r\nor running water. Some take the iuyce of the hearb Baulme in the Spring\r\ntime, and annoint the same round about the hiue, whereby the sauour of\r\nthe iuyce maye cleaue and abide on the vessell, whiche afterwarde being\r\nfayre within, sprinckle aboute with a little honny, setting the same\r\nhiue downe neare to the woodde or groue of trées fast by that spring or\r\nwater running by it, and after the same be filled with a swarme, carry\r\nit gently home. Yet doeth not this like, but in such places where the\r\nswarmes of Bées do abounde, for that oftentimes it so hapneth, that\r\nvnlesse the hiues be dailye watched, that the goers by do take them\r\naway. But to lose sundrie hiues, gretly hindreth not, so that you may\r\nin the mean whiles enioy one or two of them full.\r\n\r\nNowe hitherto hathe béene sufficientlye taughte, suche remedies and\r\nhelpes, as necessarily serue, to the taking, and recouering of Bées\r\nloste, and otherwise to finde oute straunge swarmes.\r\n\r\n\r\n                ¶ That the Bees sting no person, comming\r\n                      neare their Hiues. Cap.xxij.\r\n\r\n_Plinie_ in his twentith book writeth, that the hearb Sperage, brused\r\nand mixed with oyle, and annoynted with the same, doth defende the\r\nperson from being stinged, by comming nygh to their hiues. And in his\r\n.xxviij. booke he also wryteth, that if any happeneth to be stinged by\r\na Scorpion, that he shall neuer after be stinged of any Bée, but yet\r\nbeing stinged, he teacheth to drinke the iuyce of Hearbe-grace and Rue\r\nmixed with wine, and to lay the leaues also in plaister forme on the\r\nstinged places. In the 21. booke he writeth the like, that bées stings\r\nare by nature venomous, against the which he teacheth to take & vse the\r\niuyce of Mallowes, or the iuyce of Iuie leaues, and to annoint eyther\r\nof the two, on the stinged places, as a souerain remedy. And in the 23.\r\nbooke, he teacheth wyne for a remedy, as boyled with bay leaues, and\r\nafter drunke. In the 24. booke he teacheth to take a drop of that\r\nmolten, whiche the honny Bées make at the entrye of the Hiue, to be a\r\nlike remedy, as of the water _Bezoar_ to be vsed against venemous\r\nbittes. _Auicen_ in his seconde rule teacheth, that the decoction of\r\nthe March Mallowes wyth vineger or wine, and the same anoynted on the\r\nstinged places, to be a perfit remedie.\r\n\r\nWhiche also in his fourth rule affirmeth, that the Honnye Bée hath like\r\ndispositions to the waspe, sauing that they leaue their stings behinde\r\nthem: wherfore for remedie of the wasps, you may vse those which we\r\nhaue afore taught againste the stings of Bées.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 ¶ When and howe, the Hiues ought to be\r\n                           gelded. Cap.xxiij.\r\n\r\n_Palladius Rutilius_ in his first booke teacheth, that the hiues of\r\nBées ought not to be gelded, before you consider and sée whether they\r\nbe rype, vnto the comming of the true Honny, whyche in a manner (as hee\r\nteacheth) commeth to vse in the moneth of Iune, or as others affirme,\r\nin the ende of Auguste, vnto the midle of September.\r\n\r\nNow there be certaine notes and tokens, by whyche we trye and fynde out\r\nthe ripenesse of them, whiche be these, firste if the hiues be ful,\r\nthen do the Honny Bées drive forth the ydle drone Bées out of the\r\nHiues, and there is also hearde within a small or shrill humming of the\r\nBées for that the emptie cottages of the combs, as they were hollow\r\nbuildings, do receiue a sound & noise, procured then bigger, so that\r\nwhen there is hearde a big & hoarse sound of the humming of them, then\r\nis it not yet méet to geld the combs. _Varro_ writeth, that it is then\r\ntime to geld hiues, when as you see within, that the Bées hang\r\nclustring round, & that the holes of the hony combes be couered ouer,\r\nas it were with thin caules, for then be they full of honny. Now the\r\nday of gelding the hiues ought to be done timely in the morning, when\r\nas the Bées are astonied throughe the colde aire, and not done in the\r\nheate of the day, when they be procured to fly forth of the hiues, and\r\nbeing then very angry, to sting those persons which come to the hiues.\r\nThe maner of gelding the hiues is on this wise, first stop the holes of\r\nthe hiues, that the Bées passe not forth, with grasse or some other\r\nhearbe, after that putte vnder fine linnen ragges, or strawe, making a\r\nlittle smoake with the same, whiche smoake so flying vppe, causeth the\r\nBées after to breake & leaue their clustering togither.\r\n\r\nAfter these, with two instruments or tooles of yron, made for the only\r\npurpose, of a foote and a halfe long, or rather somewhat longer made,\r\nof whiche the one ought to be a long knife, and broade of either side\r\nthe edge, with a hafte, and hauing a crooked file on the one end. The\r\nother at the beginning plaine, and very sharpe, whereby with this the\r\ncombes may the readier and quicklier be cutte downe, with that other\r\ninstrument scraped cleane, and whatsouer filth falleth off, drawne\r\nawaye, and throwne aside. But where the hiue of the hinder parte, or\r\nparte behinde, shall haue no voide place emptie, then make a smoake (as\r\n_Varro_ commaundeth) with _Galbanum_ and drie Oxe dung, which ought to\r\nbe made in a earthen fuming pan, filled with quicke coles, or a pan of\r\nearth with a narrow mouth, and a handle like to it. So that the one\r\npart oughte to be sharper or narrower vpwarde, by whiche the smoake may\r\npasse by the little holes, and the other parte where the coles are,\r\nbroader, and with a large mouth of the one side of it, by which the\r\nperson may blowe the coles: Nowe suche a pot when it is set within the\r\nhiue, and the smoake stirred vp to the Bées, whiche by and by not\r\nquieted with the sauour, flie vnto the foreparte of the hiue, &\r\nsometimes flie quite oute of the hiue, wherby any may looke into the\r\nHiue without harme, in a maner, to the person. If there happen to be\r\ntwo swarmes in one hiue, then are there also two kindes or formes of\r\nhonny combes. For euerye company of Bées in agréement togither, doth\r\nfashion & frame the waxe, as liketh them best. But all the honny combes\r\nbeing hollowe wrought, and a little cleauing to the sides of the hiue,\r\ndo hang, whereby they may not touch the floure or bourde, for that\r\notherwise it causeth the swarmes to flye quite away. Yet the forme of\r\ntheir waxe is such, as the condition of their cottages is. For that\r\nsome Bées doe make both square and rounde spaces, and some long, so\r\nthat eche frameth, as it were certain formes in the combes, according\r\nto his kinde. So that the hony combs, are not founde alwaies alike in\r\nfashion, but these combes of what forme soeuer they be, are not to be\r\ntaken all out of the hiues. For in the beginning of Haruest, whiles the\r\nfieldes yet flourishe, take a fift parte of the combes, but after, when\r\nWinter is at hande, then leaue a thirde parte behinde.\r\n\r\n_Palladius_ willeth the hiues to be gelded in the moneth of October,\r\nand that a third part be left behind. Yet consider, that if there be\r\nstore, to take the more: if but a meane, then the halfe part of that\r\nleave for the winter time: if the cottages appeare but halfe full then\r\ntake nothing away. But _Varro_ teacheth, that a third part of the\r\ncombes maye be taken away, & the other parte left for the winter,\r\nalthough the combes be ful of honny. If you fear (saith he) a sharp\r\nwinter to follow, then take nothing at al: & of the same mind is the\r\nlearned _Vergil_ in this. But the expert practisers of our time in such\r\nmatters, do affirme, that the honny ought to be taken awaye but once in\r\nthe yeare, & this in the end of the moneth of August, vnto the middle\r\nof September. But the waxe being corrupt, then, both before and at any\r\ntime maye be taken forth of the hiues. Also as touching the honny which\r\nthe Bées giue, whether you maye take awaye either little or much, must\r\nbe considered according to the finalnesse or plentifulnesse of the hony\r\nbeing in the hiue. And according to the smalnesse or greatnesse also of\r\nthe swarm to be nourished, so that aboue the fourth part of the combes\r\nmay not be taken from any hiue. Yet this order may not be vsed alike in\r\ncountries, bicause a man must consider the dealing with the hiues,\r\naccording to the multitude of floures, & plentifulnesse of foode for\r\nthe Bées. If the waxie combes hanging down do run into a length, then\r\nwith the same yron toole which is made like to a knife, being\r\noftentimes dipped in water, that the waxe cleaue not to it, nor that\r\nthe combs remaining may be harmed, & the hiue holden on the one side\r\ncut the combs away. After this, put both your armes into the hiue,\r\ngathering togither, and taking forth the combs. But if the combes hang\r\nouerthwart in the hiue, then must you vse your scraping yron, that the\r\ncombes of the further side thruste togither, may so be cut away. Also\r\nthe old & corrupt combs are to be taken forth, the whole and full of\r\nhony to be especially left. And if there be any yong Bées in them,\r\nthose kéepe or preserue to increase the swarm in that hiue. After that,\r\ncarry al the store of the hony combes into one place, whereas you mind\r\nto make the hony, & stop diligently the sides and edges of the hiues\r\nround about, that none of the Bées may enter in, which for the hony and\r\nwaxe taken away, do eagerly séeke after, and finding the same, do\r\nvtterly consume the same if they may.\r\n\r\nTherfore, of the former matters must a smoake be made, & that (at the\r\nentry) or mouth of the hiues, that the Bées assaying to fly in, may\r\nthrough the smoke be driuen to flye backe again. Now after the hiues be\r\ngelded, and that anye shall haue ouerthwart or crossed combes at the\r\nentrance of the hiue, those then shall be so conuerted, that the parts\r\nbehind maye be emptied & left void for another time. So that when they\r\nshal be next gelded the old combs rather than the new are to be taken\r\nforth, & the waxe renewed, for that the older the waxie combes are, so\r\nmuche the worser they be.\r\n\r\nIf it happeneth, that the hiue be so made, that the same may not be\r\nremoued out of the place then ought you to geld first the hinder parte,\r\nand after the foreparte: and this especiallye ought to be done afore\r\nfiue a clocke in the morning, and after nine of the clocke at night, or\r\nin the nexte morrowe. Nowe the Bées when they knowe this, all come to\r\nfill the emptie place, so that after they haue repaired and filled the\r\nsame, and fulfilled all the reste aboute it, then flye they to the\r\nforepart, and do worke in like order. By whiche we may euidently\r\nlearne, that they haue filled the same empty place also, by their\r\nabiding stil there. Besides these, as the great plentie of honny, doeth\r\ncause sluggishnesse in the Bées, euen so doeth the much abatement, and\r\nexcéeding taking awaye of their honny, bothe dull the quickenesse and\r\ndiligence of them, and cause them also to bée sluggishe.\r\n\r\n\r\n              ¶ What the honny is, and howe from the hiues\r\n                   the same maye be prepared to vse.\r\n                              Cap.xxiiij.\r\n\r\nAs we firste gather the honny from the combes, so do we the waxe for\r\nthe comforte of the light, and other commoditie besides. Nowe what the\r\nhonny is, and howe the same taken from hiues, maye be prepared to vse,\r\nshall hereafter bée taughte.\r\n\r\nFirste the learned _Isidore_ writeth, the honny to be of the deawe of\r\nsome lyquide matter, and affyrmeth also the same to be founde sometimes\r\nin the leaues of the greate Canes. To whiche in a manner doth _Publius\r\nMaro_ agrée in this verse, writing, that hitherto the heauenlye giftes\r\nare of the Aereall honny. Others teach the honny in _India_ and\r\n_Arabia_, to be like to salte gathered there on the leaues of trées.\r\nOthers do doubt whether the honny be a sweat from heauen, or a certaine\r\nspittle of the starres, or a iuyce of the aire purging it selfe. But\r\nwhatsoeuer substance the same is, yet is it a moste swéete, subtill,\r\nand healthfull iuyce, _Plinie_ witnesseth, which at the first gathering\r\nof it, is as a cleare water, but after the boyling a while, and purging\r\nof it selfe, as the newe wine (after the pressing forth) is wonte to\r\ndo, doth by the twenty day after come to a perfect thickenesse of\r\nhonny, throughe the often repeating and working of it in the hote\r\ndayes, from the beginning of May and vnto the middle of Iune.\r\n\r\nNowe the honny is gathered in this maner: first, before the honny be\r\npressed out of the combes, must those corrupt combes hauing red filth,\r\nand hauing yong in them (if any such be there) be pressed oute, bicause\r\nthey bothe procure an euill taste, and with that iuyce corrupt the\r\nhony. The combs brused togither, ought to be put into a cleane presse,\r\nbeing yet warme, and new gathered out of the Hyues the same day, whiche\r\nlette lye there, vntil the hony by little and little be run forth, or\r\nrather for the more expedition, pressed forthe with a heauy waighte,\r\nand the same which is then come forth, is very faire rawe hony. After\r\nthat the honny with the waxe muste be boyled togither, as hereafter\r\nshall be taught.\r\n\r\nNowe when the combes be thus brused togither, and the yong Bées killed\r\nand cast forth, then must you make youre hony in this maner. As first\r\nin the Moneth of September or October, take the heauier and older\r\nhiues, which are of two or thrée yeares olde, and not hauing bred\r\nswarmes in the Sommer before: and that ouer smoke and flame of strawe,\r\ndrie flaxe, or yellowe Brimstone, the hiue a little whiles be holden,\r\nthat the Bées may so flie vppe to the toppe of the hiue, or else suche\r\nremaining below burne their wings.\r\n\r\nAfter that, turne downe the head of the hiue on the ground, and with a\r\nsharpe knife cutte the crossed stickes asunder in the Hiue, or plucke\r\nthem forth with your hand. For by that meanes are the combes wel brused\r\ntogither, and the Bées either killed with the fall of them, or else\r\nflye away. After this putte all the combes on a heape, being gathered\r\noute of the hiues here and there into a presse, leaning somewhat on the\r\none side, but some put the combs into a wine basket made of smal willow\r\nor Osier stickes finely knitte and wroughte togither, that hanged vppe\r\nin a darke place, the Honny maye runne thoroughe by little and little\r\nfrom it. After that the honny hathe thus runne forthe into a cleane\r\nearthen panne or boll standing vnder it, then the same after poure into\r\nan earthen potte, or pottes, being as yet rawe honny, but clearer and\r\nbetter than the other licour of the hony. Which for certaine daies let\r\nstand open, that the swéete licor may throughly coole, and the same in\r\nthe mean whiles often skimme or purge with a spoone. Nowe after this,\r\nthe fine péeces or crummes of the combes, which yet remaine in the\r\nbagge of wicker, or wine basket, or presse, putte into an earthen\r\npotte, panne, or kettle, ouer a verye softe fire, that the same may\r\nheate without boyling, and alwayes kéepe youre hande in the vessell, to\r\nstirre still aboute hither and thither the honny and waxe, and to open\r\nalso the waxe by péece meale vntill the honny and not the waxe, shall\r\nbe throughlye molten. When the honny through the heate, beginneth a\r\nlittle to pricke the hande, then poure all the whole Masse or\r\nsubstaunce into a strayner, and putting the same in a presse made for\r\nthe onelye purpose, wring it harde about, yet it maketh no great\r\nmatter, if that same be not so earnestly wringed or pressed out, that\r\nnone of the Honny remaine yet with the Waxe, séeing that the Honny and\r\nWaxe haue effects in some causes alike. Now this Honny whiche is thus\r\nrunne forth, is named the Sodden Honny, whyche oughte in like manner to\r\nbe poured into earthen pots, and to stande open for certaine dayes,\r\nskimming it dayly with a spoone, vntill it be throughe colde. The\r\nnobler or worthier Honny is that which runneth oute in a manner of the\r\nowne accorde, before the second pressing out of the combs. And mixe not\r\nof this seconde Honny with the firste, but kéepe them diligentlye\r\naparte, leaste by mixing the firste to the seconde, you make the beste\r\n(being the firste) the worser. After all this thus handled, the same\r\nwhiche yet remaineth in the strainer, wash diligently with Conduit or\r\nfaire Spring water, that you may so haue the Mulse or hony water, of\r\nwhich being sodden and diligently skimmed (as of this hereafter shall\r\nbe further taught) is the Mulse made, that serueth to manye good vses.\r\n\r\n\r\n               ¶ Which Honny is accompted best. Cap.xxv.\r\n\r\nCertaine Countries doe excell in the perfecte goodnesse of Honny, like\r\nas the famous _Attica_ of Gréece, which for the excellencie of the\r\nHonny is hadde in great reputation throughout the world. _Hybla_ also &\r\n_Hymetus_ being hilles of the same Countrie, which the deceiuers applie\r\nto Honny, that the same maye both be named _Hymetus_ and _Hybleus_\r\nHonny. _Creta_, _Cyprus_ and _Affrica_, as in goodnesse they are\r\nnotable or worthy, so the abundant or maruellous plentie of the Honny\r\nis there commended. Also the newnesse of Honny is likewise commended,\r\nas the auntientnesse of wines, but the Spring and Sommer Honny,\r\nespecially if the vessell or hiue stande in a valley or bottome, and\r\ndoeth excell in the waight of hande. But the honny gathered of bitter\r\nhearbes is counted vnprofitable, as the same Honny which the Bées\r\ngather in the country of _Pontus_, where the Bées onely gather their\r\nhonny of the Wormewoode. The white in all Countries is better estéemed\r\nthan the blacke, but the beste honny is that whiche is very cleare, of\r\na golden colour, of a moste pleasaunt and swéete taste, cleauyng\r\nsomewhat to the fingers in the handlyng, and but little stiffening or\r\nwaxing hard togither. And that the honny in the pouring forth, doth\r\nstraightway breake here and there, and squirteth or sprinckleth\r\n(sodainely as it were) sundrie droppes abroad, which being on thys\r\nwise, _Plinie_ teacheth to be the triall and sure note of a good and\r\nprofitable honny.\r\n\r\n\r\n          ¶ Of the venomous Honie, and of the wonderfull Honye\r\n                          of Creta. Cap.xxvj.\r\n\r\nIt so much forceth to vnderstande and know, what maner of foode the\r\nsame is, with the which the Bées do liue, as the poysoned hony also,\r\nthat may be gathered by them, whether it be euill or venomous. For the\r\nHonny of _Heraclea_ in the Countrey of _Pontus_, hath bin for certaine\r\nyeares, very dangerous, especially throughe a certaine hearbe growing\r\nwhite, whiche also vexeth their cattell by eating thereof, named of the\r\ndwellers there, _Aegellothron_. But by these notes is that Honnye\r\nfounde out and tried to be venomous, as firste, that the same is not\r\nthicke at all, the colour brighter or more glistering, and hath a\r\nstrong sauour, mouing forthwith often snéesing, and is also waightier.\r\nAlso such persons, as taste somewhat thereof, doe couet to lie or fall\r\nhastily on the earth, séeking for coldenesse, and be all on a sweate,\r\nso that in sodaine daungers, muste some spéedy helpes or remedies be\r\nministred, like as the olde Mulse of the best hony, and herb Grace, or\r\nother like confections, be often ministred to suche persons. There is\r\nalso another kind of venomous hony, in the border of the country of\r\n_Pontus_, that for the madnesse which it engendereth, is named of the\r\npeople _Neonomenon_: the same hony is supposed to be gathered of the\r\nfloure _Rhododendros_, whiche groweth plentie there in the wooddes.\r\n_Plinie_ writeth of a maruellous honny to be in _Creta_, for that in\r\n_Carina_ being a hill of that Countrey, he affirmeth a honny to be\r\ngathered, whiche the flies will not touch, and supposed also to be a\r\nsingular Honny, for the composition of euery medicine.\r\n\r\n\r\n                ¶ Of the miraculous worthiness of Honny.\r\n                               Cap.xxvij.\r\n\r\nMost men in Italy prepare and make their medicines which they purpose\r\nto kéepe long, with honny, so that honny preserueth euery thing from\r\nputrifying, which you would haue in safety, and to continue for a\r\nseason, through his clamminesse. And of this, auntient men did enbalme\r\nbodyes of the deade, which they would haue preserued, and to continue\r\nsound without corrupting many yeres, with hony only, and the same they\r\nalso smeared within the tombes or sepulchres of the deade, for the\r\nlonger kéeping of bodyes. The self same writeth the learned _Papinius_\r\nof the body of _Alexander_, which was likewise embaulmed with Hony. And\r\nnot vnlike to this writeth _Plinie_, in the xxij. booke, and xxiiij.\r\nChapter of his Histories, of sundrye dead bodyes also embaulmed with\r\nhony. Which in another place also of his Histories writeth by _Claudius\r\nCæsar_, that brought a monster out of _Egipt_ into his countrey, whiche\r\nwas also embaulmed with Honny. _Ahanæus_ also writeth, that bodies\r\nsubiect to sickenesses, maye both be kept frée from sicknesses, and\r\nfrom corrupting a long time, through the often smearing and annoynting\r\nof Honny ouer all the bodie. As the like wryters report, that the Isle\r\nof _Corsica_, or _Corse_ do, whiche liue a long time.\r\n\r\nThe _Macrobians_ being a people in _Affricke_, named also _Mœrein_, doe\r\nliue a long time, as certaine authours write, bycause with the meate of\r\nHonny, whyche is plentie with them, they dayly be fed, and vse\r\ncontinually. Some affirme that _Democritus_ which recreated by Honny,\r\nwith the only breath and sauour of the Honnye made hote, liued (as they\r\nwrite) vnto a hundred nine yeares. _Aristoxenus_ writeth, that the\r\ntable of _Pythagoras_ was dayly furnished with only breade and honny,\r\nand yet liued vnto the fourescore and ten yeres of the Philosopher\r\n_Heraclides_. The Honnye also is founde to auayle against surfettes,\r\nand of this accompted amongst the medicines putting awaye drunkennesse.\r\nAnd of this it is no maruel, that suche throughlye skilfull in\r\nPhisicke, when anye be ouercloyed or filled with Wine, do counsell\r\nfirste to emptie their stomackes by vomityng, and after against the\r\nforce of the fume euaporating of the remnaunt of the Wine yet\r\nremayning, they giue to them Honny spreade on breade, as it were by\r\nputting backe the euill, that is maye so remedie and putte awaye the\r\ngrosse fume.\r\n\r\n\r\n           ¶ How profitable the vse of Honny is in medicines.\r\n                              Cap.xxviij.\r\n\r\nFirste the white Honye is to be vsed in cooling Medicines, but the\r\nyealowe in heating medicines: also the nature and propertie of honny,\r\nis to clense and open, and to expel humors. Therefore it is profitably\r\napplyed in filthy vlcers, being boyled and annoynted vpon. It closeth\r\nalso loose and gaping fleshe, through his wholenesse. Also with Liquid\r\nAlume & honny sodden togither, are Ringwormes, and cornes or swelling\r\nof the féete healed, by annoynting therewith. Against the vncertaine\r\nsoundings and noyse of the eares, and grieuous pains of them, the hony\r\ngrounded with that salte digged out of the earth, and dropped warme\r\ninto the eares: the selfe same killeth both nits and lyce, by only\r\nannointing the heade therwith. Also the hony purgeth the eyes dimme of\r\nsight, healeth the swellings, and other defaultes and griefes of the\r\niawes, the swellings and kernels vnder the iawes, neare to the throte,\r\nafter the preparing to vse, the same be gargelled in the throate, and\r\nthe mouth washed therewith. The honie eaten causeth vryne, helpeth the\r\ncough (being cleane skimmed before) and the byte of a Snake or Adder.\r\nThe hony also helpeth those which haue drunke vnwares the iuyce of\r\nblacke Poppie, so that againste the same euill and daunger they drinke\r\nrosed honny warme. Also the same drunke helpeth the malice and daunger\r\nof Mushromes eaten, and the byte of a madde dogge, or otherwise melting\r\nin the mouth, after the forme of an _Eclegma_. Yet all the sortes of\r\nrawe Honny be windie and swell the bodie, mouing a rumbling or noyse in\r\nthe belly, procuring the cough, easily conuerted into euil humors,\r\nstopping the liuer and the milt through the clamminesse, and hurtfull\r\nto chollericke bodies, if so be the honny before (as _Dioscorides_\r\nwriteth) be not throughly skimmed and clensed as the same ought to be.\r\nThe honny also boyled both better nourishe than the rawe, yet lesse\r\nmouing the belly to solublenesse, and to the stoole. And the honny of\r\nit selfe, or mixed with others, helpeth the sore in the lungs, and all\r\nother diseases of the lungs. The honny is rightly ministered to such as\r\nhaue the impostume in the lungs and the pluresie. And the hony in which\r\ndead Bées are, is applyed to the venemous honny. The hony drunke with\r\nwine helpeth the corruptions which are engendered of the meate fishes.\r\nBut to colde and moyste bodies the honny is more profitable, therfore\r\nverie fitte for olde persons, as _Galen_ affirmeth. And to persons\r\nbeing twentie yeares of age, and of an vntemperate hotenesse, or others\r\nhote of qualitie, the honny to them is hurtefull, bycause it is soone\r\nconuerted into choller in them. _Democritus_ was on a time asked, by\r\nwhat meanes men might both continue in perfite health, and liue vnto\r\nvery old yeares, to which he thus answered: if so be men annoint their\r\nbodies outwarde with Oyle, and apply their bodies inwarde with honny.\r\nFurther honny profiteth weake persons, being applyed as the Mulse\r\nwater, of which shal after be taught in the next chapter. To persons\r\ncold of nature, the honie may aptly be ministred in hote broth, but to\r\nhote persons ministred in warme brothe, the honie is not rightly giuen.\r\nThe honny mixed with _Camphora_, & lying to settle thrée dayes before,\r\nwith the which annointing the face, doth spéedily clense the spots in\r\nthe face: the self same doth the honie, mixed with the gall of an Oxe.\r\nThe pure white honie clenseth the breast, softneth Impostumes, being as\r\nwell without, as within the bodie. The hony also mundifyeth, openeth\r\nthe stoppings of the Liuer and Mylte, helpeth dropsie bodies, and\r\nstrengthneth weake members. The Aromaticke honny much auayleth in\r\nsundrie diseases, being thus prepared, as the pure redde Rose leaues\r\nfinely clipped, and after boyled in pure white honnie, being often and\r\ndiligentlye skymmed. For such a Honnye doeth comforte and mundifye,\r\ndissolueth in the clensing the clammy swellings, digesteth the\r\nfleumaticke and grosse humors, and drunke also with colde water, it\r\nbindeth the bellie, but ministred with warm water it looseth the bellie.\r\n\r\n\r\n           ¶ Of the drinke of Honny which they cal the Mulse\r\n                water, or sweete water of the Romaines.\r\n                               Cap.xxix.\r\n\r\nBy the aunswere of _Pollio_ the Romaine vnto _Augustus_ Emperour, we\r\nmay euidently learn, that the Mulse made of hony, is healthfull drinke\r\nin strengthning the bodie. For _Augustus_ on a time demaunded of him by\r\nwhat meanes a man might liue to great yeares, and all that season frée\r\nfrom sickenesses, to whome he thus aunswered, that applying the Mulse\r\nwater within, and annoynting Oyle without the bodye, doeth worke the\r\nlike. The Mulse truly is a drinke made of water and hony mixed\r\ntogither, which the Gréeks properly name _Melicrate_, & some\r\n_Hydromel_, as the drinke made with wine vnlayde, or without water, and\r\nhony, they aptly name _Oenomel_. Now the Mulse water drunke, doeth ease\r\nthe passage of winde or breath, softneth the belly, and the long time\r\nof oldenesse changeth it into the kinde of Wine, moste agréeable and\r\nprofyting the Stomacke: but the same contrary to the Synowes, yet it\r\nrecouereth the appetite lost, and is a defence against the dangerous\r\ndrinke of Henbane, if it be ministred with Asses milke. Thys drinke\r\ntruely (_Aegineta_ wryting therof) is thus made: let eight times so\r\nmuche water be mixed vnto your Honnye prepared, whyche boyle or séeth\r\nso long, vntill no more fome aryseth to be skymmed off, then taking it\r\nfrom the fyre, preserue it to youre vse. But the same _Paule Aegineta_\r\naffyrmeth, that the Mulse profyteth nothing in manner the collericke,\r\nbycause the same in them is lightly conuerted into choller.\r\n\r\n\r\n          ¶ Of the drinke Oenomel, which is made of pure wyne\r\n                           and Hony. Cap.xxx.\r\n\r\nThe _Oenomel_, which is a swéete wine made with Honny, _Aegineta_\r\nteacheth the same, not only for the preseruation of helth, but also to\r\nexpel the torment of sicknesses, through this most wholesome drinke, as\r\nthat whiche giueth, not onely strength of body and courage, but the\r\nlong race of yeares. Also it expelleth an olde griefe of the Reines,\r\nbeing often drunke with Parcely séedes. But the beste _Oenomell_ is\r\nthat which is made of olde and tarte wine, and the beste purified hony,\r\nfor the same doth lesse swell. The same also harmeth drunke after\r\nmeales, but before taken, doeth procure an appetite. _Dioscorides_\r\nteacheth that maner of making the _Oenomell_ in this order: first he\r\nwilleth to take one gallon and a quarte of Wine, and mixing it with\r\nhalfe a gallon, and a pinte of the beste hony, to prepare the same\r\norderly. But some prepare or make the drinke spéedilier to vse after\r\nthis manner, as the hony they boyle with Wine, and after poure foorth\r\nthe same into other vesselles.\r\n\r\n\r\n           ¶ Of the singular water of Hony gotten by order of\r\n                        distillation. Cap.xxxj.\r\n\r\nThe Hony of Bées méete to distillation, ought especially to be white of\r\ncoloure, which before the distilling muste bee mixed with pure and\r\nwhite and well washed sande, but not drie in any case, after that,\r\nputte the same either into a common Rose Limbecke of Tinne, setting a\r\nhearie siue close vppon it, that it may touch the Hony in the\r\ndistilling, or else into a body of Glasse, sette into a potte of fine\r\nsifted ashes or sande, making at the firste a softe fire vnder it,\r\nvntill the first water bée come, whiche is white, and after the yelow\r\nwater appeareth, then put vnder another receiuer, setting aside the\r\nwhite, and so long distill vntill the redde beginneth to shewe: at the\r\nappearaunce of whiche, put vnder another receiuer, letting that remaine\r\nvntill no more will come. Which red water being the last, serueth for\r\nsundrie vses, as to die womens haire yellow, by often wetting the haire\r\nwith a Spunge, and drying the same in the hote Sunne. Also it causeth\r\nfayre and long haire, and stayeth the sheading of haire: besides (this\r\nthirde water) doeth clense the foule corruption and matter being in\r\nfilthye woundes, and olde vlcers, if they be washed twice a daye with\r\nthe same, causing also newe flesh to grow in those places, if you dayly\r\nwashe them with the sayd water, or otherwise dip linnen clouts in it,\r\nlaying them aptly on the sores. The selfe-same healeth places\r\ngrieuously burned, without appearaunce of anye scarre afterwarde, by\r\noften applying lynnen cloutes dropped in it. And the seconde water\r\nbeing of a golden coloure dipped into the eyes, doeth not onely helpe\r\nswollen and bleared eyes, but the pinne and webbe in them, by the dayly\r\nand often dropping of the same into the eyes. But as touching the white\r\nand firste water, there is no worthy matter mentioned in thys place by\r\nany of the old Practisers.\r\n\r\n\r\n        ¶ Another manner of distilling the Honie, more at large\r\n                           taught. Cap.xxxij.\r\n\r\nTake a pinte, or as much as you wil, of the pure rosed hony, which put\r\nit into a bodie of glasse close couered & luted about, setting the same\r\nafter into hote horse dung with a square stone on the head, & couering\r\nit ouer with the horse dung for 14. dayes, after which time, take the\r\nbody forth, setting it into a fornace of fine sifted ashes, well a\r\nfinger bredth or more aboue the hony, presupposing on your part, that\r\nlittle péeces of flint stones be put into the hony, & then distilled\r\nwith a soft fire into a receiuer well luted at the mouth, for doubt of\r\nthe ayre breathing forth. When the same beginneth to distil, then draw\r\nforth part of the fire (vnlesse you can otherwise gouerne your fire by\r\nthe help of the fornace) whiche comming forthe white, let so long\r\ndistill, vntill there appeare yealow droppes like to gold. Vpon the\r\nsight of this, set vnder another receyuer, kéeping diligently this\r\nfirste water by it selfe, and increasing the fire, let that long\r\ndistil, vntill certain white smoakes appeare, running into the\r\nreceiuer: that spéedily take away, putting to another receiuer, which\r\nlet so long distill, vntil no more will droppe forth, and this laste,\r\nis of a rubie colour in rednesse, so that if a woman often wetteth the\r\nheares of hyr head with this thirde water, setting then in the hote\r\nSunne, both to drie and wette them againe, wearing in the meane whiles\r\na large strawne hatte with an open crowne, to spreade the heares vpon,\r\nfor the spéedier drying of them, whiche so ordering, doeth not onely\r\ncause the heares to grow long and very fayre, but dyeth them in time so\r\nyealowe as gold. Also to diuerse other vses, doth this red water serue,\r\nas afore is taught in the other Chapter. The white water (which commeth\r\nfirste) by washing the face orderlye with it, doeth cause it to become\r\ncleare and fayre, and keepeth the skinne from loking olde, for a long\r\ntime, as the same hath ben experienced often by the worthy dames of\r\n_Rome_, _Naples_, and _Venice_. And the yealow lyke golde being the\r\nsecond water, doth especially serue to this vse, that if any person\r\nhappeneth to be infected with the plague or Pestilence, then to take\r\ntwo ounces of this yealow water, of _Aloes_ Epaticke, of redde Myrre,\r\nand of the east saffron, of each ten graines, and a leafe of the best\r\ngold, all which grinde into fine pouder, mixing the same with this\r\nwater: after that giue it vnto the sicke to drinke, whiche no doubt wil\r\nboth helpe this & many other diseases.\r\n\r\n\r\n            ¶ The manner of distilling a water of Hony named\r\n                     the Quintessence. Cap.xxxiij.\r\n\r\nTo make this singular and precious water, you must take two poundes of\r\nthe purest white honie, being both cleare and pleasaunt in taste,\r\nwhiche put into a body of glasse, being so bigge, that foure of the\r\nfiue partes of it maye remayne emptie, the same lute stronglye aboute,\r\nletting the heade after on it, and a receyuer aptelye to the nose of\r\nthe Still.\r\n\r\nWhen you haue thus done, then make a gentle fyre at the firste vnder\r\nit, but after increase the fire or heate more and more, vntill certaine\r\nwhite smoakes appeare in the head of the glasse bodye, which do you\r\nworkemanlye coole and turne into water, by the wettyng of lynnen\r\nclothes in colde water, and layed on the heade and nose, towarde the\r\nreceiuer, for that turneth into a water so red as bloud: and being all\r\ncome, putte it into another glasse, stopping the mouth close, whiche\r\nlet stande so long, vntil the water become verye cleare, and in coloure\r\nto the Rubie.\r\n\r\nNow being on this wise, distill the same againe in _Balneo Mariæ_, and\r\nso often repeate this, vntill you haue distilled it sixe or seauen\r\ntimes ouer, that the coloure be chaunged, and in the ende, to the\r\ncoloure of golde. Whiche then is moste pleasaunt of sauoure, and so\r\nswéete, that nothing maye be compared like to it, in flagrantnesse of\r\nsmell. The Quintessence doeth dissolue golde, prepareth it apte to be\r\ndrunke, and any Iewell put into the water, it doth also dissolue the\r\nsame. Also this is named the Blessed Water, in that giuing to any two\r\nor thrée drams to drinke, being at the point of death, doth so\r\nsodainely recouer the person againe, as doeth the Quintessence of wine.\r\nAnd washing any grieuous wounde or stripe with the water, doeth in\r\nshorte time heale the same. Also this pretious water doth maruellously\r\nhelp the cough, the Rheume, the disease of the Splen, and many other\r\ndiseases, whiche woulde scarcely be beléeued. The water also ministred\r\ndaily vnto a person sicke of the Palsey, for the space of .xlvj. daies,\r\nhe was by the mightie helpe of God, & this miraculous water, throughly\r\nhealed of the disease. Also this Quintessence doth helpe the falling\r\nsicknesse, and preserueth the bodye from putrifying, so that by al\r\nthose we maye learne, that thys is rather a diuine water from Heauen\r\n(and sente from God) to serue vnto all ages.\r\n\r\n\r\n               ¶ The manner of drawing and making Waxe of\r\n                     the Honny combes. Cap.xxxiiij.\r\n\r\nThe Honny being drawen from the combes, although some Bées hang on them\r\ndeade, yet putte all togither into a fayre panne or cauldron, into\r\nwhiche poure so muche water or more, as the quantitie of the combes be.\r\nThis set ouer a softe fire, vntill the same what it be, is throughly\r\nheated and molten in the panne, and in the melting continually sturre\r\nthe same aboute, with a bigge splatter or some staffe, leaste the Waxe\r\ncleaue to the panne sides, throughe the flame or heate of fire, and\r\nappeare burned: after poure the whole substaunce into a course hairen\r\nbagge, pressing it forth into a troughe or other like vessell, made for\r\nthe only purpose, on which poure twoo or thrée kettles full of hote\r\nwater, that no dregs hang after on the Waxe, and by that means shall\r\nyou haue the Waxe both pure and cleane. But if you wil haue it caste\r\ninto faire round cakes, and to be cleaner and purer, then melte the\r\nWaxe againe, and being molten, poure it into a cleane vessell, which\r\nwashed likewise with warme water (as aboue was taught) set after in the\r\nSunne, by which meanes, the cake will continue verye long faire of\r\ncouloure.\r\n\r\n\r\n              ¶ What Waxe is beste allowed and commended.\r\n                               Cap.xxxv.\r\n\r\nWaxe being the foode of lighte, and seruing vnto innumerable vses of\r\nmen, of all the kindes, the same is beste allowed and commended, whiche\r\nis bothe newe made, meanelye redde of coloure, somewhat fattie,\r\nsmelling swéete, hauyng some sauoure in it of the Honny, and cleare. Of\r\nthe Waxe also in sundrie Counties, that in the countrie of _Pontus_ is\r\nwell commended, and the same in the Isle of _Creta_: nexte to these is\r\nthe Waxe in the Isle of _Corsica_, which is made of the Boxe trée, and\r\nsupposed to haue some good effectes in it for Medicine.\r\n\r\n\r\n           ¶ Of the great commoditie and benefite of Waxe in\r\n                         Medicines. Cap.xxxvj.\r\n\r\nWaxe hath a meane among heating things, both in the cooling, drying,\r\nand moistning, as writeth _Galen_ in the seauenth booke of Simples, and\r\n.22. Chapiter, whiche properly helpeth the roughnesse of the breaste,\r\nwhen it is ioyned or mixed with the oyle of Violets, for that bothe\r\nmollifyeth or softneth the sinewes, ripeneth and resolueth vlcers. The\r\nquantitie of a pease in waxe swallowed downe of Nurses, or such women\r\nas giue sucke, both dissolue the milke courded in the pappes. And tenne\r\nlittle péeces of pure newe waxe, vnto the biggenesse of a hempséede,\r\ndrunke downe at one time, doeth cause the milke not to courde in the\r\nwomans stomacke and breastes. If the priuie place or thereabout, of\r\neither man or woman, happeneth to swell, then by applying an ointment\r\nmade of white waxe, it shortly assuageth and healeth the same. If anye\r\nalso happeneth to be diseased with the bloudy flixe, by stuffing a yong\r\nPigeon with newe waxe, after rosting the same, and eating the fleshe\r\nthereof, doeth in shorte time after staye the same. Also, if a Quince\r\nmade hollowe and filled with pure newe waxe, be after rosted vnder hote\r\nembers, vntill the same be tender, and eaten fasting without drinking\r\nafter it, doth in like sorte staye and helpe the perillous flixe, and\r\nscouring of bloude. The waxe besides serueth to all maner of plaisters,\r\nointments, suppositories, and such like.\r\n\r\n\r\n           ¶ Of that whych is a stay of the combes, and made\r\n             for a defence of Bees from colde.

Nowe this\r\nmatter (as aboue was taught) is the stay of the hony combes, by whiche\r\nBées stoppe and kéepe forth al manner of colde and other annoyances\r\nwhich might endamage them, the same also being of so strong a sauor,\r\nthat some vse it in the stéede of _Galbanum_. _M.

When the same bath boiled twice or thrice vp, remoue the\r\npanne from the fire: the waxe being throughly colde, take forth of the\r\npanne, and scraping off the filth, if any suche hang on, putte againe\r\ninto newe salte water, séething it againe. And when the waxe hathe so\r\noften boyled (as aboue was taughte) then take off the panne from the\r\nfire, and taking the bottome of a newe earthen panne, melt it with\r\ncolde water, whiche dippe by little and little into the waxe, drowning\r\nit a little, and that the water be aboue the waxe, whereby the waxe\r\nmaye become verye thinne, and be the sooner cooled it selfe. And taking\r\nby and by oute the moulde or bottome, drawe firste the rounde cake off,\r\nand wetting againe the bottome in colde water, dip it into the waxe,\r\nand the same so long doe, vntill you haue drawne off all that waxe into\r\ncakes of like sorte, whiche after stitche throughe with thréede,\r\nhanging the cakes on a rope one from another, and that in the daye time\r\noften wetting them in the Sunne, but in the nighte time, in the Moone\r\nlight: and so long doe this, vntill the waxe be white. And if anye\r\ndesireth to haue waxe whiter than this, then let him do the like, as\r\nabouesaide, but boyle the waxe oftner. Some in stéede of the salte\r\nseawater, take strong Brine water, in whiche they boyle the waxe in the\r\nsame manner twice or thrice, as aboue was taughte.

And in\r\nthe like sorte may you make the gréene Waxe, if instéede of the\r\nVermillian, you take so much of the gréene Coporas finely ground, as\r\nyou did of the Vermilian.\r\n\r\n\r\n                ¶ Howe to drawe a profitable Oyle out of\r\n                        Waxe, for sundrie vses.\r\n                                Cap.xl.\r\n\r\nThe Oile of Waxe, is myraculous and diuine in workyng, bycause it\r\nserueth in a manner vnto all griefes. _Reymond Lully_ greatly\r\ncommendeth this Oyle, approuing it rather as a celestiall and diuine\r\nremedie, and that this in woundes, doeth worke moste miraculously,\r\nwhich for his maruellous commoditie, not so well to be allowed of the\r\ncommon Chirurgions, bycause this pretious Oyle healeth a wounde, be the\r\nsame neuer so wide and bigge, being before wide stitched vppe, in the\r\nspace of tenne or twelue dayes at the moste. But those whiche are\r\nsmall, this Oyle healeth in thrée dayes, by annoynting onely on the\r\ncuttes or woundes, and laying after linnen cloutes, wette in the saide\r\nOyle, vpon the woundes. For inward diseases the saide Oyle worketh\r\nmyraculouslye (if that you minister or gyue a dramme at a time in white\r\nWine to drinke) and stayeth also the sheading of haire, either on the\r\nhead or beard, by annointing the places with this Oyle. Besides these,\r\nit is miraculous in the procuring of vrine, being mightily stopped, and\r\nhelpeth also stitches and paine in the loynes, by drinking the like\r\nquantitie of the Oyle aboue taughte in white wine.\r\n\r\nNow the making and drawing of this oyle, is on this wise: firste take a\r\nbody of glasse, named a Retort, which stronglye lute aboute with clay\r\nand flocks, diligently tempered togither with salte water: after the\r\nbody is thus fenced and thoroughe drie, putte in a pounde or more of\r\npure newe waxe, so that the saide waxe filleth not aboue halfe youre\r\nbody, and to euerye pounde of Waxe, poure in foure ounces, of the\r\npouder of redde bricke, finely brused, whiche after set into an earthen\r\npotte, filling it rounde aboute with fine sifted ashes or sande. After\r\nthis, set the potte with the bodye in it, on a fornace, making a softe\r\nfire at the firste vnder it, and after encreasing a little more your\r\nfire, distil them so long, vntill all youre Oyle be come, whiche after\r\na while wyll congeale in the receiuer: but it maketh no greate matter,\r\nalthough the oyle so doe, for it is neuerthelesse in his perfection.\r\nBycause that if you shoulde distill it so often ouer, vntil it will\r\ncongeale or stiffen no more in the receiuer, then shall you make it\r\nouer hotte, and so quicke in the mouth, that it is not possible by anye\r\nmeanes to drinke it downe. But being once distilled, you maye either\r\ngiue it in Wine to drinke, or annoint with the Oyle on any place of the\r\nbodye where you will, whiche will always doe good, and hurte in no\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nAnd in consideration of these aboue taught, you maye evidently learne\r\nand perceiue, that this myraculous Oyle oughte to be hadde in greate\r\nveneration of the common sorte.\r\n\r\n\r\n            ¶ Another waye of drawing the Oyle of Waxe moste\r\n            noble, and doth maruelously help the cold Goute,\r\n            the Sciaticke, the swelling of the legs, and al\r\n                  other griefes proceeding of a colde\r\n                            cause. Cap.xlj.\r\n\r\nTake of pure newe waxe so muche as you please, which put into a panne\r\nouer the fire to melte, and being molten, haue by you in a readinesse\r\nanother panne well glased, and cleane within, filled with verie good\r\nand perfecte wine, into whiche poure youre molten waxe, letting it\r\nsoake and drinke in well, and washe often in the saide wine. After this\r\ntake the waxe forth, melting it againe ouer the fire, and molten, washe\r\nthe same againe in the beste wine, so that euerie time melting the\r\nwaxe, poure it into freshe new wine, washing and soaking it in the same\r\ndiligently, after wringing it very wet with the hands. And vsed on this\r\nwise, both melt and washe againe in the abouesaide manner, and this\r\nalso do for eighte times togither. Then set the same forth, being a\r\ncleare season and ayre, all the nighte throughe, after which put the\r\nwaxe into a Retorte with a little of _Mumia_, and oyle of _Ypericon_ or\r\nSaint Iohns wort, and a little olde Oyle: and although without these it\r\nmaye doe good, yet mixed with these it worketh farre better, than vsed\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nNowe to retourne to the former matter this crooked bodye or Retorte set\r\nin fine sifted ashes, and a gentle fire made vnder it, vntill all the\r\noyle do runne forth, and in this comming forth of the oile, shall\r\nappeare all the foure Elements, as Ayre, Water, Earth and Fyre, whiche\r\nwill orderly appeare in the receiuer, right maruellous to sée. And the\r\nOyle being thus fullye drawne, worketh miraculouslye in all diseases\r\nwhich procéed of a colde cause, like as we haue aboue taught.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n                    ¶ The conclusion to the Reader.\r\n\r\nThus (gentle Reader) I haue (I truste) fullye satisfied thy desire in\r\nas manye things as are needefull to be knowen.

And if the weather in these thrée daies shal be\r\nneither wholy drie, nor wholy moiste, then shall folowe an vnstedfaste\r\nWinter.\r\n\r\nAnd like as the weather shall be at the Sunnes entraunce into the signe\r\nLibra, as at the daye of the entraunce, the daye before, and the daye\r\nafter, suche for the more parte shall be the Spring, as in the moneth\r\nof Marche, Aprill, and May.\r\n\r\nAnd looke howe the weather shal be at the Sunnes entrance into the\r\nsigne Aquarius, at the daye of the entraunce, the daye before, and the\r\ndaye after, (suche for the more parte) shall the weather be in the\r\nmoneths of Iune, Iuly, and August.\r\n\r\nAnd manye auntient men affyrme, that like as the weather shall be\r\nwhiles the Sunne is running by the signe Libra, and vnto the .20.\r\ndegrée of Scorpio, which time is from the daye named (the Exaltation of\r\nthe crosse) vnto the day of al Saints, such for the more parte shall\r\nthe yeare following be, as in diuiding that foresaide time into twelue\r\nmoneths, and that foure daies doe aunswere to eche moneth, of the\r\nwhiche foure dayes, that eache one of the foure, doeth declare the\r\ncondition of the quarter following, and beginning also to recken\r\nNovember as the first moneth of the yeare.\r\n\r\nAnd the generall signes of the dearth and plentie after the minds of\r\nthe auncient husband men be these, as the ouermuch coldenesse drying,\r\nthe ouermuch moysture softning, the ouermuche heate greatly burning,\r\nand the ouermuch drinesse putrifying and working into dust.\r\n\r\nFor when any of these qualities shall excéede in the proper time, but\r\nespecially in that time, which to the corne and fruites do not agrée,\r\nthen shall dearth and scarcitie both of fruites and corne ensue.\r\n\r\nAs for example, when the moneth of March shal be ouer moyst and wet,\r\nwhich rather ought to be drie, and that the moneth of April shal be\r\ndrie, which then ought to be moyst, doth after pronounce the penurie of\r\nthe fruites of the earth.\r\n\r\nAnd if that part also of sommer shal be weat, in which the corne doth\r\nthen fall vnto ripenesse, that rather ought to be drie, doth after\r\nsignifie the scarcitie both of corne and other fruites of the earth.\r\n\r\nAnd the like may be saide of the other constitutions, which when the\r\nElementall qualities shal be in such a condition as do best agrée, then\r\ndoe they promise both fruitfulnesse and plentifulnesse.\r\n\r\nAnd if in the Spring be signes of colde and drought, and that in the\r\nende of the spring neare the full moone be frostes, then shall follow\r\nvery small yéelde of the fruites of the earth, and little wine that\r\nyere following.\r\n\r\nAnd if the spring be drie, then fewe shall the fruites of the trées be,\r\nyet good, and the scarcitie of corne shal be that yeare.\r\n\r\nAnd if the Spring shall be colde, the fruites of the Earthe shall be\r\nlate ripe.\r\n\r\nAnd if the Spring and Sommer shall be ouer wette, or mistie, or colde,\r\nwith cloudie weather for manye daies together, whiles all the trées\r\nhaue borne their blossoms, and the fieldes their floures, and beginne\r\nto shedde their floure, then shall follow the scarcitie of fruites of\r\nthe earth in that yeare, or else a verie greate rot of them, and many\r\nsicknesses in that yeare.\r\n\r\nAnd if the sommer be drier than customably, then shal follow the\r\nscarcitie of corne, yet the Sommer fruites shall that yeare be sound,\r\nthe fishes then die, and most sharpe sicknesses shall raine that yeare.\r\n\r\nAnd if the Sommer shal be hotter than customably, then shal followe\r\nmany sicknesses or diseases, yet great plentie of the Sommer fruites\r\nthat yeare.\r\n\r\nAnd if the Sommer shal be colder than customably, then shall follow a\r\nhealthfull yere, but the fruites of the earth shal late ripe that yeare.\r\n\r\nAnd here further note of the spring, that if in the same season of the\r\nspring, there shal be a more plentie of all floures and fruits toward\r\nthan customably, doth after signifie a scarcitie of corne that yere,\r\nvnlesse the heate of sommer doth otherwise reforme the same.\r\n\r\nAnd the wise and auncient husbandmen haue obserued, that when the\r\nwinter shal send downe store of raine on the earth, so that the same\r\nexcéede not or bée too much, and that the March following be drie, and\r\nthe Aprill wette by often shoures, and that the same part also of\r\nSommer bée drie in which the corne falleth to ripenesse, then doth the\r\nsame promise a plentifull yeare.\r\n\r\nAnd when that part of the Haruest shal be faire and drie, in which the\r\nwheat is sowen, and the parte of sommer in which corne falleth too\r\nripenesse shal be faire and drie, the spring also meanely warme, doth\r\nthen not only promise fruitefulnesse, but a plentifull yeare of corne.\r\n\r\nAnd nowe the Haruest moyster than customably doth putrifie the Grapes,\r\nand causeth a small yéelde of wines that yeare, with the scarcitie of\r\nother fruites.\r\n\r\nAnd if in the latter part of Haruest it be moyster, then in the yere\r\nfollowing shal ensue the scarcitie of corne.\r\n\r\nAnd if the Haruest bée drier in the first part, then in the yeare\r\nfollowing shal Rie, and that smal graine named Mill, and suchlyke, be\r\ndeare.\r\n\r\nAnd if the haruest be hoter than customably, then shall followe a\r\ndiseased yeare and that dangerus.\r\n\r\nAnd if the Haruest be colder than customably, then shall follow the\r\nlosse of the Haruest fruites both in the store and tast of them.\r\n\r\nAnd the Winter colde and drie, is of all husbandmen commended, but\r\nextréeme colde, doeth then flea the trées, especially those which ioy\r\nin a warme aire, as the Pomegranade trée, the Oliue trée, the Lemmon\r\ntrée, the Figge trée, the Peach trée, and such like.\r\n\r\nAnd if the Winter excéede in the extremitie of coldnesse, then doth it\r\nsignifie harme both vnto the Vine and the Oliue trée, the Cherie trée,\r\nand the yellow Quince trée.\r\n\r\nAnd if the Winter be hote and moyst, then the same doth pronounce an\r\nvnhealthfull yeare, and daunger to séedes and fruites of the earth.\r\n\r\nAnd the excesse qualitie, and distemperature of any of the foure\r\nquarters, is euill and daungerous to the fruites of the earth.\r\n\r\nAnd the plentie of snowe falling in the due season of the yeare, doth\r\nbatten the earth, (and if the others do helpe) then doth it signifie\r\nthe plentie of corne and other fruites of the earth.\r\n\r\nAnd if any washeth the handes with snowe, it doth then make them\r\nstedie, in that the snowe is ingendered of a vapour somewhat drie and\r\nearthly.\r\n\r\nAnd the snowe nourisheth shéepe & other beasts in that the snow is\r\ningendered of the moyst aire, in which life consisteth.\r\n\r\nAnd the snowe increaseth the corne and other growing things on earth,\r\nin that by his coldnesse it so doth shut the poures of the earth, that\r\nthe heate with the whiche the séedes of the earth be cherished, cannot\r\nthen breath forth.\r\n\r\nAnd the snow heateth and cherisheth the earth, by the thicke couering\r\nof it, and defendeth the gréene wheat and other séedes sowen, from the\r\nsharpe and vehement colde then of the ayre.\r\n\r\nAnd the snowe may be kept all the yeare under the earth, couered with\r\nstrawe, and profitable it is to mixe with the wine in hote sommer, and\r\nnecessarie also to coole the ayre about sick persons.\r\n\r\nAnd the vnprofitable falling of the deawe, mistes, or fogges\r\n(especially when all crescent thinges doe bud foorth, and shewe theyr\r\nfloure) as in the Moneth of Aprill and May, as well on the trées, corne\r\nand grasse, which beastes then feding on be greatly harmed, through the\r\ndeaw fallen, and all other thinges also much harmed by the same, as\r\nhath bene often obserued by the ancient and wise husbandmen.\r\n\r\nAnd the ouermuch falling of raine, frostes or haile, especially in the\r\nspring time, and in the winter time, whilst the corne is yet as grasse,\r\nthe excesse of raine also doth then threaten the scarcitie of vittailes\r\nto ensue that yeare.\r\n\r\nAnd the great plentie of beanes, after the opinion of the common\r\nhusbandmen, through the much raine fallen, doth fore shewe the\r\nscarcitie of corne, and especially of wheate that yeare.\r\n\r\nAnd a like iudgement may be giuen of the Oke and Holly trée, which if\r\nthey beare plentifully, then a fruitfull yeare followeth, and\r\ncontrariwise bearing but few, then a deare yeare of corne to ensue.\r\n\r\nAnd the great plentie of Grashoppers, wormes and Catterpillers\r\nappearing in their proper time more than customably, doe not only\r\ndeclare harme to vines and séedes sowen, but to all fruites that yeare.\r\n\r\nAnd the great store of windes, not only cause little fruites, but\r\nscarcitie of corne to ensue that yeare.\r\n\r\nAnd a stilnesse in a manner throughout the yeare, doth declare a\r\nlikelyhode of the plague to ensue shortly after.\r\n\r\nAnd the auncient _Hipocrates_ writeth, that when in the Sommer the\r\nNorth winde long continueth, and in the Harvest, the South winde with\r\nstore then of raine, it doeth after threaten in the Winter the\r\nheadache, hoarsenesse of voice, the coughe, consumptions or impostumes\r\nto ensue.\r\n\r\nAnd if after a drie Sommer (as write the auntient Phisitions) the North\r\nwinde doeth long continue in the Harueste, then the bodies of women,\r\nand suche diseased with a moiste sicknesse, doe then in that season the\r\nrather recouer health, in that the drinesse of the seasons and windes\r\nis contrarie to the excesse, and to the rottennesse of the humors, by\r\nwhiche the sicknesses were caused.\r\n\r\nAnd if the Winter shall be hote and moiste, and the Spring colde and\r\ndrie, then doth the same threaten sicknesse to men in the Sommer, and\r\nthat women with childe shall haue vntimely birthes of a light occasion.\r\n\r\nAnd _Hypocrates_ writeth, that when in the Winter be longer Northerly\r\nwindes, and in the Spring longer Southerlye windes, and that raynie and\r\nwette in the Sommer following, then doeth followe Agues, and the\r\nDiseases of the eies.\r\n\r\nAnd when after a colde Winter, and that South windes and raynie in the\r\nSpring, and that the Sommer be drie then in the Haruest following doe\r\nagues ensue, paines also of the bowels thoroughe the greate scouring of\r\nthe bodie, and Sicknesses, with the whiche olde men, diseased persons,\r\nand children be then more pained.\r\n\r\nAnd when the Southwest winde doth long blowe aboute the end of Haruest,\r\nthen those persons diseased with a long sicknesse, do shortly after die.\r\n\r\nAnd a further knowlege of dearth and plentie of victualles, and of\r\nsickenesse may be had on this wise.\r\n\r\nFirste in the end of Haruest, cutte open two or thrée Oke apples,\r\nlooking whether there be in them either Flyes, Worms, or Spiders.\r\n\r\nFor if in the Oke apple be founde Wormes, or Magots, then they signifie\r\n(after the opinion of auncient husbandmen) to the dearth and scarcitie\r\nin that yeare.\r\n\r\nAnd if the Oke apple cut open be founde like to flies, it doth after\r\nthreaten battel to ensue in that yeare.\r\n\r\nAnd if in the Oke apple be founde like to Spiders, then doe they\r\nforeshewe the plague or pestilence to ensue in that yeare.\r\n\r\nAnd to conclude, the onely proofe of the former taught, shal moue the\r\nReader better to credite these.\r\n\r\n\r\n

So that small yéelde of corne yet plentie of\r\nOyle shal be that yeare.\r\n\r\nAnd if the Moone runne then in the signe Taurus, at the first\r\nappearance of the dog starre, then doth it signifie much raine, fogges\r\nand mistes that shal harme much that yeare.\r\n\r\nAnd if the Moone runne then in the signe Gemini, at the first\r\nappearance of the dogge starre, it doth after promise the plentie of\r\ncorne and wine and all other fruites of the earth, a yet diseased\r\nyeare, and to be doubted that a King shal then die, and that rebellion\r\nalso shall be moued that yeare.\r\n\r\nAnd if the Moone run then in the signe Cancer at the first appearance\r\nof the dog starre, aboue the earth, it doth after threaten drought,\r\nwith the great scarcitie of corne to ensue in that yere:\r\n\r\nAnd if the Moone runne then in the signe Leo at the firste sight of the\r\ndogge starre, it after promiseth the plentie both of wines and Oyle,\r\nand the good cheape of corne and other victuals that yeare. And yet to\r\nbée feared the commotions of the common people, and slaughter of the\r\nsame to ensue, with an erthquake, and land floudes to happen in that\r\nyeare.\r\n\r\nAnd if the Moone runne then in the signe Virgo, at the first appearance\r\nof the dogge star, it after signifieth the plentie of showers, and the\r\ngreate store of fruites of the earth, and the cheapenesse also of\r\ncattell. And yet to be feared, that women shal be deliuered before\r\ntheir time in that yeare.\r\n\r\nAnd if the Moone runne then in the signe Libra, at the first appearance\r\nof the dogge starre, it after declareth the stirring vp of a king, and\r\na commotion of the common people. And yet the plentie of fruites of the\r\ntrées, although there be a likelyhood of the scarcitie of corne and\r\noyle in that yeare.\r\n\r\nAnd if the Moone runne then the signe Scorpio, at the first appearance\r\nof the dogge starre, it after declareth the commotion of priests, the\r\ndestruction of Bées, and an infectiue aire to ensue that yeare.\r\n\r\nAnd if the Moone runne then in the signe Sagitarius, at the first sight\r\nof the dogge starre aboue the earth, it after signifieth a raynie\r\nyeare, yet fruitefull, and the plentie of corne, and ioy among men. And\r\nyet is to be feared the death of cattell, & the multitude of foules in\r\nthat yeare.\r\n\r\nAnd if the Moone runne then in the signe Capricornus at the first\r\nappearance of the dogge star aboue the earth, it after declareth the\r\ncommotion of souldiours, and greate store of raine, and yet the plentie\r\nof corne, wines and Oyle, and al other thinges good cheape in that\r\nyeare.\r\n\r\nAnd if the Moone run then in the signe Aquarius, at the first\r\nappearance of the dog star aboue the earth, it after signifieth of a\r\nmost likelyhood, the death of a king or Prince, the scarcitie of corne,\r\nand the plentie of such flyes with the long hinder legges, that burne\r\ncorne by the touching of it. And yet little raine, with the plague to\r\nensue in that yeare.\r\n\r\nAnd if the Moone runne then in the signe Pisces, at the first\r\nappearaunce of the dogge starre aboue the earth, it after declareth\r\nmuch raine, and the death of byrdes. And yet doth it promise a\r\nsufficient store, & laudable plentifulnesse, both of Wines, Oyle, and\r\ncorne, but manye persons shall be diseased in that yeare.\r\n\r\n\r\n    ¶ Other profitable instructions, right necessarie for husbandmen\r\n                           to know. Cap.iiij.\r\n\r\nAnd first if the horne of the Ramme (nere his eare) be boxed, the same\r\ndoeth tame his fiercenesse. And if his right genitour be trussed vp\r\nbefore he goeth to couer the Ewe, then doeth he beget an Ewe lambe. And\r\nif the left be thus straite trussed vp, and the righte hanging downe,\r\nthen doeth he begette a hée lambe.\r\n\r\nAnd if in the time of the South wind blowing, the Ram doth then couer\r\nthe Ewe, he doth after beget a shée lambe.\r\n\r\nAnd if when the North wind bloweth the Ram doth then couer the Ewe,\r\ndoth after beget a hée lambe. And of what colour also the vaines shal\r\nbe vnder the tongue of the Ewe, suche shal the colour of the skinne of\r\nthe lambe be, for if she hath black vaines vnder the tong, then the\r\nLambe shall be blacke of skin, and if white vaines vnder the tong, then\r\nshall she haue a white lambe: and if of diuerse colours, then the lambe\r\nshal be of diuerse colours on the skin. And that antient Isaac writeth,\r\nthat Rams in their yong yeares be of lesser moysture and clammynesse,\r\nthan be the sucking lambs, and this is, through their age and qualitie\r\nthen ruling.\r\n\r\nAnd therefore the fleshe of yong weathers be better, and ingender\r\nbetter bloud than the sucking lambes.\r\n\r\nAnd this is héere spoken of such Rammes as be gelded, in that their\r\nmoysture and hotenesse is then temperate.\r\n\r\nAnd the wethers ouer old are to be refused in eating, in that they be\r\nthen cold and drie without moysture, and they smallye nourish and\r\nhardly disgest.\r\n\r\nAlso béefe and other fleshe of beastes being olde, be euill to eate,\r\nthrough the coldenesse and drynesse, and through the lacke of the\r\nmoysture and hotnesse. And when the olde Rams in their time to couer\r\nthe Ewe, be sooner moued thereto, than the yong Rammes, it doeth then\r\nsignifie a good and profitable season to ensue in that yeare, and a\r\ngood season and prosperous also for shéepe. But if in the proper time\r\nto couer the Ewe, the yong Rammes be sooner prouoked thereto than the\r\nolde Rams, then doeth followe the greate rotte or murreyne of shéepe in\r\nthat yeare.\r\n\r\nAlso Ewes by drinking of water conceiue the sooner wyth Lambe and of\r\nthis the shéepeheardes giue them salte to eate, wherby the more\r\ndrinking of water, they may so conceiue with yong, and they are also by\r\nthat meanes preserued the healthfuller. And in the Haruest also some\r\nsheapheardes giue them to eate Gourdes seasoned with salt to encrease\r\ntheir milke, for by that meanes both the milke more plentifully issue\r\nforth of their teates, and the Ewes do sooner conceiue. Also in Sommer\r\nis the colde Northerly water good for them, and in the Haruest the\r\nwarme Southerly water good for them.\r\n\r\nAlso to let shéepe féede in the ende of the day, is greatelye\r\ncommended: and if they also stirre but little abrode, the same is\r\nthought very profitable, in that the muche iourneying, and labouring of\r\nthem hither and thither, doth so cause them to become leane. Also the\r\nskilful shéepeheards knowe, whiche shéepe will well endure the sharp\r\nwinter, and which not, in that vpon some of the shéepes backes (as they\r\naffirme) Ise maye be founde, and vpon othersome none at al. So that by\r\nthis may be learned, that such shéepe which be weake, a man can hardely\r\nplucke off the Ise from their backes. And further learne, that those\r\nshéepe whiche haue long tayles, maye hardlier abide the sharpe colde\r\nwinter, than those hauing broade tayles: and the shéepe also curled of\r\nhaire (do in like sorte) hardlier endure the bitter winter.\r\n\r\nAnd besides these, the number greatly harmeth shéepe, especially if\r\nanye Ewe being with yong happeneth to be alone at that instant, for\r\nthat she then with lambe, doeth of the fearefull noyse of the thunder,\r\ndeliuer hir yong one before the time. And for a speciall remedie to\r\nsaue that vntimely casting of Lambes at such times, the skilfull\r\nshéepeheardes haue found out, that the only driuing of many Ewes\r\ntogither, is a sure safegard to them to auoyde this occasion. Besides,\r\nif you will remoue the rot of shéepe, that they die no more, then take\r\nthe belly of a Ram, and séeth the same in wine and water togither,\r\nwhich after mixe with water, and giue the same generallye to all the\r\nshéepe to drinke, for by that meanes shall they againe be recouered of\r\ntheir disease. And here learne, that the fleshe of shéepe, and other\r\nfoure footed beastes, which commonly féede in moyste ground, is euill\r\nto féede vpon, for the harde digestion of the same. Also learne, that\r\nthe good shéepe are knowen by their age, as being neyther to olde, nor\r\nyet as Lambes: and by the forme also they are knowen, if so be you\r\nfinde them large of body.\r\n\r\nAnd they besides haue much and soft wool, and both thicke & long heare,\r\nespecially on the nape, and about the necke, and the like haire on the\r\nbelly. And both the health & sicknesse of shéepe may be knowen, if so\r\nbe any openeth their eyes, and findeth the vaines within to be redde\r\nand small, which vndoubtedly declareth them to be sound and good: but\r\nit those vaines that appeare white, or redde, and bigge, then those\r\nshéepe are diseased and weake.\r\n\r\nAnd if the shéepe go lustily and boldely by the waye, it is a sure\r\ntoken that they be sound, but sadly and hanging down the heade, then be\r\nthey diseased. These hitherto of the yearely coniectures, and other\r\nrules, only méete for husbandmen to vnderstand and know.\r\n\r\n                                  (∵)\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n                          Transcriber's note:\r\n\r\n    Scribal abbreviations have been expanded.\r\n\r\n    Variations in spelling, accenting, and hyphenation have been\r\n    retained.\r\n\r\n    All instances of 'VV' standing in for 'W' have been changed to 'W.'\r\n\r\n    Table of Contents entries have been regularised to the format\r\n    'cap.xij.'\r\n\r\n    cap.first., comma inserted after 'Aristotle,' \"Palladius,\r\n    Aristotle, Theophrastus\"\r\n\r\n    cap.first., 'aud' changed to 'and,' \"diuided with plightes and\r\n    rings.\"\r\n\r\n    cap.vij., 'diligeuce' changed to 'diligence,' \"care and diligence\r\n    of the Bees.\"\r\n\r\n    cap.viij., full stop inserted after 'sting,' \"or lacketh a sting.\"\r\n\r\n    cap.viij., second 'the' struck, \"whiche the king carrieth\"\r\n\r\n    cap.viij., comma changed to full stop, \"owe vnto him.
