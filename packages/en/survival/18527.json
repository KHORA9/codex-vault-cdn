BACKGROUND\r\n\r\nAfter viewing the destruction wrought by the eruption of Mt. St.\r\nHelens in Washington State in May 1980, President Carter became\r\nconcerned about the impacts of a similar event of low probability but\r\nhigh damage potential, namely a catastrophic earthquake in California,\r\nand the state of readiness to cope with the impacts of such an event.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the President's concern, an _ad hoc_ committee of the\r\nNational Security Council was formed to conduct a government review of\r\nthe consequences of, and preparation for such an event. In addition to\r\nthe Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Committee included\r\nrepresentatives from the Office of Science and Technology Policy, the\r\nUnited States Geological Survey of the Department of the Interior, the\r\nDepartment of Defense, the Department of Transportation, and the\r\nNational Communications System, at the Federal level; State of\r\nCalifornia agencies and California local governments at the State and\r\nlocal levels; and consultants from the private sector. During the\r\nsummer of 1980, the participants in this review prepared working papers\r\non relevant issues and problem areas for the consideration of the _ad\r\nhoc_ committee. Pertinent facts, conclusions and recommendations were\r\nreviewed with the Governor of the State of California. The President\r\nreviewed the _ad hoc_ committee's findings and approved the\r\nrecommendations for Federal action. This report summarizes the results\r\nof the assessment and notes these actions.\r\n\r\nA number of Federal legislative and administrative actions have been\r\ntaken to bring about, in the near future, an increased capability to\r\nrespond to such an event. The Earthquake Hazards Reduction Act of 1977\r\n(P.L. 95-124) authorizes a coordinated and structured program to\r\nidentify earthquake risks and prepare to lessen or mitigate their\r\nimpacts by a variety of means. The coordination of this program, the\r\nNational Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP), is the\r\nresponsibility of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA),\r\nwhich is charged with focusing Federal efforts to respond to\r\nemergencies of all types and lessen their impacts before they occur.\r\nThe NEHRP has six high-priority thrusts:\r\n\r\n      » Overall coordination of Federal departments and agencies'\r\n        programs\r\n\r\n      » Maintenance of a comprehensive program of research and\r\n        development for earthquake prediction and hazards\r\n        mitigation\r\n\r\n      » Leadership and support of the Federal Interagency\r\n        Committee on Seismic Safety in Construction as it develops\r\n        seismic design and construction standards for use in\r\n        Federal projects\r\n\r\n      » Development of response plans and assistance to State and\r\n        local governments in the preparation of their plans\r\n\r\n      » Analysis of the ability of financial institutions to\r\n        perform their functions after a creditable prediction of\r\n        an earthquake as well as after an event, together with an\r\n        exploration of the feasibility of using these institutions\r\n        to foster hazard reduction\r\n\r\n      » An examination of the appropriate role of insurance in\r\n        mitigating the impacts of earthquakes.\r\n\r\nMore recently, a cooperative Federal, State, local, and private-sector\r\neffort was initiated to prepare for responding to a credible\r\nlarge-magnitude earthquake, or its prediction, in Southern California.\r\n\r\n\r\nB. SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThe review provided the overall assessment that the Nation is\r\nessentially unprepared for the catastrophic earthquake (with a\r\nprobability greater than 50 percent) that must be expected in\r\nCalifornia in the next three decades. While current response plans and\r\npreparedness measures may be adequate for moderate earthquakes,\r\nFederal, State, and local officials agree that preparations are\r\nwoefully inadequate to cope with the damage and casualties from a\r\ncatastrophic earthquake, and with the disruptions in communications,\r\nsocial fabric, and governmental structure that may follow. Because of\r\nthe large concentration of population and industry, the impacts of\r\nsuch an earthquake would surpass those of any natural disaster thus\r\nfar experienced by the Nation. Indeed, the United States has not\r\nsuffered any disaster of this magnitude on its own territory since the\r\nCivil War.\r\n\r\nThe basis for this overall assessment is summarized below and\r\ndiscussed in more detail in the subsequent chapters of this report.\r\n\r\n\r\nC. LIKELIHOOD OF FUTURE EARTHQUAKES\r\n\r\nEarth scientists unanimously agree on the inevitability of major\r\nearthquakes in California. The gradual movement of the Pacific Plate\r\nrelative to the North American Plate leads to the inexorable\r\nconcentration of strain along the San Andreas and related fault\r\nsystems. While some of this strain is released by moderate and smaller\r\nearthquakes and by slippage without earthquakes, geologic studies\r\nindicate that the vast bulk of the strain is released through the\r\noccurrence of major earthquakes--that is, earthquakes with Richter\r\nmagnitudes of 7.0 and larger and capable of widespread damage in a\r\ndeveloped region. Along the Southern San Andreas fault, some 30 miles\r\nfrom Los Angeles, for example, geologists can demonstrate that at\r\nleast eight major earthquakes have occurred in the past 1,200 years\r\nwith an average spacing in time of 140 years, plus or minus 30 years.\r\nThe last such event occurred in 1857. Based on these statistics and\r\nother geophysical observations, geologists estimate that the\r\nprobability for the recurrence of a similar earthquake is currently as\r\nlarge as 2 to 5 percent per year and greater than 50 percent in the\r\nnext 30 years. Geologic evidence also indicates other faults capable\r\nof generating major earthquakes in other locations near urban centers\r\nin California, including San Francisco-Oakland, the immediate Los\r\nAngeles region, and San Diego. Seven potential events have been\r\npostulated for purposes of this review and are discussed in chapter\r\nII. The current estimated probability for a major earthquake in these\r\nother locations is smaller, but significant. The aggregate probability\r\nfor a catastrophic earthquake in the whole of California in the next\r\nthree decades is well in excess of 50 percent.\r\n\r\n\r\nD. CASUALTIES AND PROPERTY DAMAGE\r\n\r\nCasualties and property damage estimates for four of the most likely\r\ncatastrophic earthquakes in California were prepared to form a basis\r\nfor emergency preparedness and response. Chapter III gives details on\r\nthese estimates. Deaths and injuries would occur principally because\r\nof the failure of man-made structures, particularly older, multistory,\r\nand unreinforced brick masonry buildings built before the adoption of\r\nearthquake-resistant building codes. Experience has shown that some\r\nmodern multistory buildings--constructed as recently as the late\r\n1960's but not adequately designed or erected to meet the current\r\nunderstanding of requirements for seismic resistance--are also subject\r\nto failure. Strong ground shaking, which is the primary cause of\r\ndamage during earthquakes, often extends over vast areas. For example,\r\nin an earthquake similar to that which occurred in 1857, strong ground\r\nshaking (above the threshold for causing damage) would extend in a\r\nbroad strip along the Southern San Andreas fault, about 250 miles long\r\nand 100 miles wide, and include almost all of the Los Angeles-San\r\nBernardino metropolitan area, and all of Ventura, Santa Barbara, San\r\nLuis Obispo, and Kern counties.\r\n\r\nFor the most probable catastrophic earthquake--a Richter magnitude 8+\r\nearthquake similar to that of 1857, which occurred along the Southern\r\nSan Andreas fault--estimates of fatalities range from about 3,000, if\r\nthe earthquake were to occur at 2:30 a.m. when the population is\r\nrelatively safe at home, to more than 13,000, if the earthquake were to\r\noccur at 4:30 p.m. on a weekday, when much of the population is either\r\nin office buildings or on the streets. Injuries serious enough to\r\nrequire hospitalization under normal circumstances are estimated to be\r\nabout four times as great as fatalities. For the less likely prospect\r\nof a Richter magnitude 7.5 earthquake on the Newport-Inglewood fault in\r\nthe immediate Los Angeles area, fatalities are estimated to be about\r\n4,000 to 23,000, at the same respective times. Such an earthquake,\r\ndespite its smaller magnitude, would be more destructive because of its\r\nrelative proximity to the most heavily developed regions; however, the\r\nprobability of this event is estimated to be only about 0.1 percent per\r\nyear. Smaller magnitude--and consequently less damaging--earthquakes\r\nare anticipated with greater frequency on a number of fault systems in\r\nCalifornia.\r\n\r\nIn either of these earthquakes, casualties could surpass the previous\r\nsingle greatest loss of life in the United States due to a natural\r\ndisaster, which was about 6,000 persons killed when a hurricane and\r\nstorm surge struck the Galveston area of the Texas coast in 1900. The\r\nhighest loss of life due to earthquakes in the United States occurred\r\nin San Francisco in 1906, when 700 people were killed. By way of\r\ncomparison (in spite of the vast differences in building design and\r\npractices and socioeconomic systems) the devastating 1976 Tangshan\r\nearthquake in China caused fatalities ranging from the official\r\nChinese Government figure of 242,000 to unofficial estimates as high\r\nas 700,000. Fortunately, building practices in the United States\r\npreclude such a massive loss of life.\r\n\r\nProperty losses are expected to be higher than in any past earthquake\r\nin the United States. For example, San Francisco in 1906, and\r\nAnchorage in 1964, were both much less developed than today when they\r\nwere hit by earthquakes. And the San Fernando earthquake in 1971, was\r\nonly a moderate shock that struck on the fringe of a large urban area.\r\nEach of these three earthquakes caused damage estimated at about $0.5\r\nbillion in the then current dollars. Estimates of property damage for\r\nthe most probable catastrophic earthquake on the Southern San Andreas\r\n(Richter magnitude 8+) and for the less probable but more damaging one\r\n(Richter magnitude 7.5) on the Newport-Inglewood fault, are about $15\r\nbillion and $70 billion respectively. By comparison, tropical storm\r\nAgnes caused the largest economic loss due to a natural disaster in\r\nthe United States to date but it amounted to only $3.5 billion (in\r\n1972 dollars).\r\n\r\nIt should be noted, however, that substantial uncertainty exists in\r\ncasualty and property damage estimates because they are based on\r\nexperience with only moderate earthquakes in the United States (such\r\nas the 1971 San Fernando earthquake) and experience in other countries\r\nwhere buildings are generally less resistant to damage. The\r\nuncertainty is so large that the estimated impacts could be off by a\r\nfactor of two or three, either too high or too low. Even if these\r\nlowest estimates prevail, however, the assessment about preparedness\r\nand the capability to respond to the disasters discussed in this\r\nreport would be substantially unchanged.\r\n\r\nAssuming a catastrophic earthquake, a variety of secondary problems\r\ncould also be expected. Search and rescue operations--requiring heavy\r\nequipment to move debris--would be needed to free people trapped in\r\ncollapsed buildings. It is likely that injuries, particularly those\r\nimmediately after the event, could overwhelm medical capabilities,\r\nnecessitating a system of allocating medical resources to those who\r\ncould be helped the most. Numerous local fires must be expected;\r\nnevertheless, a conflagration such as that which followed the Tokyo\r\nearthquake of 1923, or the San Francisco earthquake of 1906, is\r\nimprobable, unless a \"Santa Ana type\" wind pattern is in effect. Since\r\nthe near failure of a dam in the San Fernando, California, earthquake\r\nof 1971 (which was a moderate event), substantial progress has been\r\nmade in California to reduce the hazard from dams, in some cases\r\nthrough reconstruction. For planning purposes, however, experts\r\nbelieve that the failure of at least one dam should be anticipated\r\nduring a catastrophic earthquake in either the Los Angeles or San\r\nFrancisco regions.\r\n\r\nExperience in past earthquakes, particularly the 1971 San Fernando\r\nearthquake, has demonstrated the potential vulnerability of commercial\r\ntelephone service to earthquakes, including the possibility of damage\r\nto switching facilities from ground shaking and rupture of underground\r\ncables that cross faults. This is especially serious because\r\nimmediately following earthquakes, public demand for telephone\r\nservices increases drastically. This increased demand overloads the\r\ncapability of the system, even if it had not been damaged, and\r\ntherefore management action to reduce the availability of service to\r\nnon-priority users and to accommodate emergency calls is mandatory.\r\nRadio-based communication systems, particularly those not requiring\r\ncommercial power, are relatively safe from damage, although some must\r\nbe anticipated. The redundancy of existing communication systems,\r\nincluding those designed for emergency use, means that some capability\r\nfor communicating with the affected region from the outside would\r\nalmost surely exist. Restoration of service by the commercial carriers\r\nshould begin within 24 to 72 hours as a result of maintenance and\r\nmanagement actions; however, total restoration of service would take\r\nsignificantly longer.\r\n\r\nWhile numerous agencies have the capability for emergency\r\ncommunication within themselves, non-telephonic communication among\r\nentities and agencies in the affected area is minimal. This is true\r\nfor Federal, State, and local agencies. This weakness has been pointed\r\nout repeatedly by earthquake response exercises, and the problem is\r\nraised by almost every emergency preparedness official at every level\r\nof government. Consequently, a major problem for resolution is the\r\noperational integration of communications systems and networks among\r\nthe relevant Federal, State, and local agencies.\r\n\r\nBecause of their network-like character, most systems for\r\ntransportation and water and power generation and distribution, as a\r\nwhole, are resistant to failure, despite potentially severe local\r\ndamage. These systems would suffer serious local outages, particularly\r\nin the first several days after the event, but would resume service\r\nover a few weeks to months. The principal difficulty would be the\r\ngreatly increased need for these systems in the first few days after\r\nthe event, when lifesaving activities would be paramount.\r\n\r\nPortions of the San Francisco Bay Area and of the Los Angeles Area\r\ncontain substantial concentrations of manufacturing capacity for\r\nguided missiles and space vehicles, semiconductors, aircraft parts,\r\nelectronic computing equipment, and airframes. Their specific\r\nvulnerability to the postulated earthquakes was not analyzed. In the\r\nevent of major damage, however, the long-term impacts may be mitigated\r\nsomewhat by such measures as the use of underutilized capacity located\r\nelsewhere, substitution of capacity from other industries, imports,\r\nuse of other products, and drawing-down of inventories.\r\n\r\nSince we have not recently experienced a catastrophic earthquake in\r\nthe United States, there are many unknowns which must be estimated\r\nwith best judgment. This is true particularly for the response of\r\nindividuals as well as governmental and other institutions. Popular\r\nassumptions of post-disaster behavior include antisocial behavior and\r\nthe need for martial law, the breakdown of government institutions,\r\nand the requirement for the quick assertion of outside leadership and\r\ncontrol. Practical experience and field studies of disasters, however,\r\nindicate that these assumptions are not necessarily correct. On the\r\ncontrary, the impacts of the disaster commonly produce a sense of\r\nsolidarity and cooperativeness among the survivors. Nonetheless, the\r\nperception remains among emergency response officials that there will\r\nbe an increased need for law enforcement following the event.\r\n\r\nAnother major unknown involves whether a medium or short-term warning\r\nof the event would be possible and how such a warning could be\r\nutilized most effectively. The technology for earthquake prediction is\r\nin an early stage of development and, therefore it is problematical\r\nthat researchers will succeed in issuing a short-term warning before a\r\ncatastrophic earthquake, should the event occur in the next few\r\nyears. Yet as research progresses, scientifically-based,\r\nintermediate-term warnings are possible, but subject to a high degree\r\nof uncertainty. Consequently, response preparations must be made for\r\nboth an earthquake without warning, and one with a short-or\r\nintermediate-term warning, possibly with a significant level of\r\nuncertainty.\r\n\r\n\r\nE. CAPABILITY FOR RESPONSE\r\n\r\nPlanning for response to a large-scale disaster is a complicated\r\nprocess encompassing many variables such as population densities and\r\ndistribution characteristics; land-use patterns and construction\r\ntechniques; geographical configurations; vulnerability of\r\ntransportation; communications and other lifeline systems; complex\r\nresponse operations; long-term physical, social, and economic recovery\r\npolicies. These factors, together with the realization that an\r\nearthquake has the potential for being the greatest single-event\r\ncatastrophe in California, make it incumbent upon the State to\r\nmaintain as high a level of emergency readiness as is practicable, and\r\nto provide guidance and assistance to local jurisdictions desiring to\r\nplan and prepare for such events. Annex 2 reviews the general nature\r\nof preparedness planning and the basic characteristics of California\r\nand Federal Government plans.\r\n\r\nFederal, State, and local emergency response capabilities are judged\r\nto be adequate for moderate earthquakes--those that are most likely to\r\noccur frequently in California and cause property damage in the range\r\nof $1 billion. Such an event, however, would severely tax existing\r\nresources and provide a major test of management relationships among\r\ndifferent governmental levels. Federal, State, and local officials,\r\nhowever, are quick to point out serious shortcomings in their ability\r\nto respond to a catastrophic earthquake. An analysis of the\r\npreparedness posture of 60 local governments, 34 California State\r\norganizations, and 17 Federal agencies, carried out by the California\r\nOffice of Emergency Services (OES) and FEMA, indicates that response\r\nto such an earthquake would become disorganized and largely\r\nineffective. Many governmental units have generalized earthquake\r\nresponse plans, some have tailored earthquake plans, and several plans\r\nare regularly exercised. The coordination of these plans among\r\njurisdictions, agencies, and levels of government, however, is\r\ninadequate. In addition, the potential for prediction is not\r\nincorporated; long-term recovery issues are not considered; and\r\ncommunications problems are significant, as discussed above. Overall,\r\nFederal preparedness is deficient at this time. Early reaction to a\r\ncatastrophic event would likely be characterized by delays,\r\nineffective response, and ineffectively coordinated delivery of\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\nFEMA Region IX (San Francisco) has drafted an Earthquake Response Plan\r\nfor the San Francisco Bay area. Annex 2 gives an overview of this\r\ndraft plan. This is a site-specific plan for response to potential\r\ncatastrophic earthquake occurrences. The emergency response portion\r\nrelies upon a decentralized approach which provides for Federal\r\ndisaster support activities to be assigned to selected Federal\r\nagencies by mission assignment letters. No specific plans have been\r\nprepared in this detail for other seismic risk areas, although it is\r\nexpected that the Bay Area plan could be easily adapted to other\r\nareas. The Department of Defense and the Department of Transportation\r\nare developing detailed earthquake plans that would ensure a\r\nwell-organized and adequate response to mission assignments for a\r\nmajor earthquake. The plans of other agencies need further\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nVery significant capabilities to assist in emergency response exist\r\nwithin the California National Guard, California Highway Patrol, the\r\nDepartments of Health Services and Transportation, and the U.S.\r\nDepartment of Defense. Capabilities exist for such lifesaving\r\nactivities as _aerial reconnaissance, search and rescue, emergency\r\nmedical services, emergency construction and repair, communications,\r\nand emergency housing and food_. Current estimates by both Federal and\r\nState officials, however, indicate that at least 6 to 8 hours would be\r\nrequired before personnel and equipment can be mobilized and begin\r\ninitial deployment to the affected area. During the period before the\r\narrival of significant outside assistance critical to the saving of\r\nlives (especially of those trapped in collapsed buildings), the public\r\nwould be forced to rely largely upon its own resources for search and\r\nrescue, first aid, and general lifesaving actions. The current level\r\nof public preparation for this critical phase of response can be\r\ndescribed as only minimal. Much of the current state of preparedness\r\narises from past programs aimed at a wide spectrum of emergencies,\r\nparticularly civil defense against nuclear attack. New or strengthened\r\nprograms are needed to enhance public preparedness.\r\n\r\nFEMA has recently entered into a cooperative effort with California\r\nState and local governments to prepare an integrated prototype\r\npreparedness plan to respond to a catastrophic earthquake in Southern\r\nCalifornia or to a prediction of such an event. The plan's completion,\r\nin late 1981, promises to improve substantially the state of readiness\r\nto respond to the prediction and the occurrence of an earthquake in\r\nthat area and to provide a model which could be applied to other\r\nearthquake-prone regions of California and the rest of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\nF. FINDINGS, ISSUES, AND ACTIONS\r\n\r\nThe _ad hoc_ committee responsible for this review developed several\r\nsignificant findings related to the implications of major earthquakes\r\nin California and our capabilities to respond to them. It then\r\nidentified major relevant issues raised by these findings and caused a\r\nnumber of actions to be taken. A brief discussion of the results of\r\nits review follows.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Leadership\r\n\r\n=Finding=: _Effective leadership at all governmental levels is the\r\nsingle most important factor needed to improve this Nation's\r\npreparedness for a catastrophic earthquake in California._ The problem\r\nof emergency preparedness is severely complicated because\r\nresponsibilities for preparation and response cut across normal lines\r\nof authority. Further complication arises from the large areal extent\r\nof the impacts expected from a major earthquake, affecting literally\r\ndozens of government entities. The emergency services coordinator at\r\nany level of government is effective only to the extent he or she is\r\nbacked by the political leadership at that level. This is especially\r\ntrue when preparedness activities must be done, for the most part,\r\nwithin existing resources. City and county officials must increasingly\r\naccept their share of the responsibility for preparedness, but\r\ncommitment by State or Federal leaders is also essential. The general\r\ntendency among elected officials and the public is to ignore the\r\nexisting hazard problem. Experience, however, teaches that effective\r\nresponse mechanisms must be in place before the disaster; they cannot\r\nbe developed in the time of crisis. Overcoming this apathy and\r\ndeveloping the organizational arrangements among Federal, State, and\r\nlocal government and volunteer agencies--together with the private\r\nsector and the general public will require, above all, leadership.\r\n\r\n      =Issue=: The leadership role of the Federal Government in\r\n      preparing for a catastrophic earthquake in California and\r\n      how this leadership role is to be exerted require\r\n      clarification.\r\n\r\n        =Action=: The President has communicated with the\r\n        Governor of California to indicate the results of this\r\n        review, to express concern about the need for cooperative\r\n        leadership to prepare for the event, and to offer to\r\n        increase the Federal effort with the State of California\r\n        and local governments in the cooperative undertaking to\r\n        prepare for a catastrophic earthquake. He stressed that\r\n        the Federal role is to supplement the effort and\r\n        resources of the State, and that commitment of\r\n        significant Federal resources would be contingent upon\r\n        the application of significant State resources. In his\r\n        response to the President's communications, the Governor\r\n        of California underscored the State's readiness to\r\n        participate in this cooperative effort and announced his\r\n        signing into law a measure that would provide substantial\r\n        State resources (see annex 1). A summary of the new law\r\n        (A.B. 2202) is contained in annex 3.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Management of Preparedness and Response Activities\r\n\r\n=Finding=: _Preparedness must be developed as a partnership between\r\nFederal, State, and local governments with improvements needed at all\r\nlevels_, as none have the resources or authorities to solve the\r\nproblem alone.\r\n\r\n      =Issue=: Since the Nation faces a very probable earthquake\r\n      in California sometime during the next 30 years, FEMA\r\n      should provide the necessary leadership, management, and\r\n      coordination required to strengthen planning and\r\n      preparedness within the Federal Government, as delegated\r\n      under the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program of\r\n      1977 and the Disaster Relief Act of 1974. In this effort,\r\n      FEMA requires the support and assistance of numerous other\r\n      Federal agencies.\r\n\r\n        =Actions=: FEMA is taking steps to:\r\n\r\n        » Strengthen significantly its management, research,\r\n          application, and coordination functions, as delegated\r\n          under the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program\r\n          and Disaster Relief Act.\r\n\r\n        » Lead other agencies in the development of a\r\n          comprehensive preparedness strategy detailing specific\r\n          objectives and assignments, and periodically monitor\r\n          accomplishments in meeting assigned responsibilities.\r\n\r\n        Departments and agencies with appropriate capabilities\r\n        will provide needed support to FEMA in strengthening\r\n        Federal preparedness and hazard mitigation programs.\r\n\r\n      =Issue=: A major deficiency that has been identified is the\r\n      potential for delay following a catastrophic earthquake in\r\n      processing a request for a Presidential declaration of a\r\n      major disaster, and the subsequent initiation of full-scale\r\n      Federal support for lifesaving actions. The first few hours\r\n      are critical in saving the lives of people trapped in\r\n      collapsed buildings; consequently, this is when Federal\r\n      support is needed most. Decisions on post-event recovery\r\n      aspects of Federal assistance can be deferred until\r\n      lifesaving operations are underway and sufficient\r\n      information about damage is in hand.\r\n\r\n        =Action=: FEMA will develop and negotiate, before the\r\n        event, an agreement with the State of California which\r\n        will enable the President to declare a major disaster and\r\n        initiate full-scale Federal support for lifesaving and\r\n        humanitarian action within minutes of a catastrophic\r\n        earthquake. The agreement will defer resolution of issues\r\n        relating to longer-term restoration and recovery and\r\n        similar questions with large budgetary implications until\r\n        adequate damage estimates are available. The Executive\r\n        Branch will thus be able to arrive at an informed\r\n        decision.\r\n\r\n      =Issue=: Significant improvements in the Federal, State,\r\n      and local capability for coordination of operational\r\n      response to a catastrophic earthquake are needed.\r\n\r\n        =Actions=: FEMA and other appropriate Federal agencies will\r\n        increase their efforts, in a partnership with appropriate\r\n        State and local agencies and volunteer and private-sector\r\n        organizations, to:\r\n\r\n        » Complete development and agreement on fully integrated\r\n          earthquake response plans for both the San Francisco\r\n          and Los Angeles regions, including provision for\r\n          predicted as well as unpredicted earthquakes, building\r\n          upon the existing draft plan for San Francisco.\r\n\r\n        » Establish a small FEMA staff in California dedicated to\r\n          the coordination of earthquake preparedness planning and\r\n          implementation.\r\n\r\n        » Develop improved mechanisms for the coordination of\r\n          medical and mortuary activities following a catastrophic\r\n          earthquake.\r\n\r\n        » Identify and document the critical requirements for\r\n          emergency communications--particularly non-telephonic\r\n          communications--among Federal, State, and local\r\n          agencies. Shortfalls between critical requirements and\r\n          current capabilities, as well as remedial actions or\r\n          recommended solutions for each will be identified in\r\n          accordance with the \"National Plan for Communications\r\n          Support in Emergencies and Major Disasters.\" This\r\n          review will include consideration of using existing\r\n          satellite communications or a dedicated system, should\r\n          it be found necessary.\r\n\r\n        » Cooperatively conduct practice response exercises with\r\n          State and local officials that will prepare officials\r\n          and the public for conditions that might be encountered\r\n          in a catastrophic earthquake and that would reveal\r\n          deficiencies in planning.\r\n\r\n      =Issue=: Improving the current inadequate preparedness of\r\n      the public for a catastrophic earthquake requires a\r\n      substantial increase in public information and public\r\n      awareness. Although public information is primarily a\r\n      State, local, and private-sector responsibility, the\r\n      Federal Government has a role as well. Because citizens\r\n      will have no choice but to rely largely upon their own\r\n      resources in the first several hours immediately following\r\n      a catastrophic earthquake, it is important that certain\r\n      basic knowledge about lifesaving measures be very widely\r\n      disseminated.\r\n\r\n        =Action=: FEMA will stimulate and work with the State of\r\n        California and other appropriate groups to develop and\r\n        publicize earthquake awareness, hazard mitigation\r\n        techniques, specific post-earthquake actions to be taken,\r\n        including first aid, and other pertinent information.\r\n\r\n      =Issue=: The possibility of a credible,\r\n      scientifically-based prediction of a catastrophic\r\n      earthquake poses serious challenges to government and our\r\n      society. The current level of scientific understanding of\r\n      earthquake prediction and the available resources are such\r\n      that present instrumentation efforts are directed toward\r\n      research rather than maintaining extensive monitoring\r\n      networks for real-time prediction. The transition from\r\n      research to fully operational capability will require\r\n      additional scientific understanding as well as resources.\r\n      Earthquake predictions are possible, perhaps likely,\r\n      however, from the current research effort. Even with a\r\n      significant level of uncertainty, any scientifically\r\n      credible prediction that indicates a catastrophic\r\n      earthquake is expected within about 1 year or less, will\r\n      require very difficult and consequential decisions on the\r\n      part of elected officials at all levels of government.\r\n      Decisions may include such possibilities as the\r\n      mobilization of National Guard and U.S. Department of\r\n      Defense resources prior to the event, the imposition of\r\n      special procedures or drills at potentially hazardous\r\n      facilities, such as nuclear reactors or dams, the\r\n      condemnation or evacuation of particularly unsafe buildings\r\n      with the subsequent need for temporary housing, and the\r\n      provisions of special protection of fragile inventories. If\r\n      the prediction is correct and appropriate actions are\r\n      taken, thousands of lives can be saved and significant\r\n      economic losses can be avoided. The costs of responding to\r\n      a prediction may be substantial, however, and the\r\n      commitment of resources undoubtedly will have to be made in\r\n      the face of considerable uncertainty and even reluctance.\r\n      Indeed, the possibility of an inaccurate prediction must be\r\n      faced squarely.\r\n\r\n        =Actions=: FEMA, in conjunction with other appropriate\r\n        Federal agencies, State and local governments, and\r\n        volunteer and private-sector organizations, will increase\r\n        its actions to develop procedures for responding to a\r\n        credible, scientific earthquake prediction, including:\r\n\r\n        » Identification of constructive and prudent actions to\r\n          be taken\r\n\r\n        » Analysis of the costs and benefits of various\r\n          alternative actions\r\n\r\n        » Identification of roles and responsibilities in deciding\r\n          which actions should be implemented and by whom\r\n\r\n        » Criteria for evaluating circumstances when the provision\r\n          of Federal assistance would be appropriate\r\n\r\n        The U.S. Geological Survey of the Department of the\r\n        Interior will:\r\n\r\n        » Maintain a sound and well-balanced program of research\r\n          in earthquake prediction and hazard assessment based\r\n          upon a carefully considered strategic plan\r\n\r\n        » Work with State and local officials and FEMA to develop\r\n          improved mechanisms for the transmission of earthquake\r\n          predictions and related information, and to plan for the\r\n          utilization of the capability for earthquake prediction\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Resources\r\n\r\n=Finding=: While leadership and management are essential ingredients to\r\nachieve an adequate earthquake preparedness posture, _the availability\r\nof adequate staffing and resources at all levels of government\r\ndetermines the efficacy of agency programs and initiatives_. In many\r\nagencies, earthquake preparedness has been accorded a low priority in\r\ntheir programs. This is a manifestation of a more general problem of\r\nminimal agency resource allocation to emergency preparedness. The\r\nresults of the actions that have been indicated will be limited unless\r\nadditional resources are made available.\r\n\r\n      =Issue=: Additional resources should be provided as\r\n      necessary to accelerate the earthquake hazard mitigation\r\n      and preparedness activities under the National Earthquake\r\n      Hazards Reduction Program.\r\n\r\n        =Action=: FEMA has reassessed its priorities and is\r\n        allocating resources to increase the staffing, funding,\r\n        and management attention and direction for earthquake\r\n        hazards mitigation, including preparations for a\r\n        catastrophic earthquake in California. This includes an\r\n        increase of staff resources in FEMA Region IX for\r\n        Federal, State, and local coordination of planning,\r\n        preparedness, and mitigation. Resource needs that cannot\r\n        be fully met by the reassessment and reallocation for\r\n        Fiscal Year 1981 should be identified and justified along\r\n        with needs for Fiscal Year 1982 in the course of the\r\n        budget submissions for Fiscal Year 1982. To facilitate an\r\n        adequate and balanced response by other Federal agencies,\r\n        FEMA will provide timely guidance to other agencies on\r\n        specific priorities for this effort in relation to other\r\n        major preparedness goals. The Office of Management and\r\n        Budget and the Office of Science and Technology Policy\r\n        will work together to develop a cross-agency ranking of\r\n        budgetary resources for earthquake preparedness for\r\n        Fiscal Year 1982.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nGEOLOGIC EARTHQUAKE SCENARIOS\r\n\r\n\r\nA. MAJOR EVENTS\r\n\r\nFor purposes of assessing the consequences of a major California\r\nearthquake, scenarios for seven large earthquakes were developed. The\r\nscenarios depict expectable earthquakes that could severely impact on\r\nthe major population centers of California. In each case they are\r\nrepresentative of only one possible magnitude of earthquake that could\r\noccur on the indicated fault system. On each fault system there is a\r\ngreater probability of one or more damaging earthquakes of somewhat\r\nsmaller magnitude than the postulated event. The postulated\r\nearthquakes are listed in the following table.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE 1\r\n\r\nMAJOR CALIFORNIA EARTHQUAKES\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n                                               Current\r\n                                               Annual        Likelihood\r\n                                               Probability   of\r\n                                               of            Occurrence\r\n                                 Richter       Occurrence    in Next\r\nRegion            Fault System   Magnitude[1]  (Percent)     20-30 Years\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nLos Angeles-      Southern\r\nSan Bernardino    San Andreas    8.3             2-5           High\r\n\r\nSan Francisco     Northern\r\nBay Area          San Andreas    8.3             1             Moderate\r\n\r\nSan Francisco\r\nBay Area          Hayward        7.4             1             Moderate\r\n\r\nLos Angeles       Newport-                                     Moderate\r\n                  Inglewood      7.5             0.1           -Low\r\n\r\nSan Diego         Rose Canyon    7.0             0.01          Low\r\n\r\nRiverside                                                      Moderate-\r\nSan Bernardino    Cucamonga      6.8             0.1           Low\r\n\r\nLos Angeles       Santa Monica   6.7             0.01          Low\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n   [1] This is the estimated largest magnitude earthquake expected\r\n   at a reasonable level of probability. The main shock can be\r\n   expected to be followed by large aftershocks over a period of\r\n   weeks or longer. Each large aftershock would be capable of\r\n   producing additional significant damage and hampering disaster\r\n   assistance operations.\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThese earthquake scenarios represent the largest magnitude events\r\nestimated on the basis of a variety of geologic assumptions. The\r\nappropriateness of these assumptions depends on the intent of the\r\nanalysis and the state of geologic knowledge. Therefore, the resulting\r\nestimates may not be appropriate for other purposes, such as the\r\ndevelopment of seismic design criteria for a specific site. The\r\ndevelopment of such criteria commonly requires detailed analyses of\r\nthe site and its immediate geologic environment beyond the scope of\r\nthis report. Consequently, detailed site analyses may require\r\nmodification of the conclusions reached in this report, particularly\r\nfault systems other than the San Andreas and Hayward faults.\r\n\r\n\r\nB. GEOLOGIC EVIDENCE\r\n\r\nSome of the possible earthquakes listed are repeat occurrences of\r\nhistorical events, others are not, but geologic evidence indicates\r\nthat earthquakes occurred on these faults before settlement of the\r\nregion. Based on available data, the postulated earthquake magnitudes\r\nwould be the largest events that could be expected at a reasonable\r\nlevel of probability. They represent a selection of events useful for\r\nplanning purposes, but are by no means the only such events likely to\r\noccur either on these or other fault systems.\r\n\r\nThe historic record of seismicity in California is too short to\r\ndetermine confidently how often large earthquakes reoccur. Information\r\non past earthquakes must be gleaned from the geologic record and\r\ntherefore, presents a picture of past seismicity that is incomplete\r\nand not yet fully deciphered. Current knowledge about the recurrence\r\nof large earthquakes on specific faults is rudimentary. The\r\nprobabilities of occurrence shown above are order-of-magnitude\r\nestimates and subject to considerable uncertainty, especially for the\r\nless probable events.\r\n\r\n\r\nC. DESCRIPTION OF EVENTS\r\n\r\nFollowing are brief descriptions of postulated events. Figure 1 gives\r\ntheir geographic location.\r\n\r\n\r\n   1. Los Angeles-San Bernardino/Southern San Andreas Fault\r\n      (Magnitude 8.3)\r\n\r\n      For the past several thousand years, great earthquakes have been\r\noccurring over a 300 km length of the San Andreas fault approximately\r\nevery 100 to 200 years, 140 years on the average. The last such event\r\ntook place in 1857. The probability of occurrence of this earthquake\r\nis estimated to be currently as large as 2 to 5 percent per year and\r\ngreater than 50 percent in the next 30 years. The fault skirts the\r\nedge of the Los Angeles-San Bernardino metropolitan region, thus most\r\nof the urbanized area lies further than 20 miles from the source of\r\nstrong shaking. Because of the distance, shaking would be more\r\nhazardous for large structures than for one- to two-story houses. The\r\nlong duration of shaking could trigger numerous slides on steep\r\nslopes and cause liquefaction in isolated areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n   2. San Francisco Bay Area/Northern San Andreas Fault\r\n      (Magnitude 8.3)\r\n\r\n      A repeat occurrence of the 1906 earthquake, in which the San\r\nAndreas fault broke over 400 km of its length, would cause severe\r\ndamage to structures throughout the Bay Area and adjacent regions. The\r\nextensive urban development on lowlands and landfill around San\r\nFrancisco Bay would be especially hard hit and liquefaction in many of\r\nthese areas would intensify the damage to structures erected on them.\r\n\r\n\r\n   3. San Francisco Bay Area/Hayward Fault (Magnitude 7.4)\r\n\r\n      The last large events to occur on this fault were in 1836 and\r\n1868. Should a major earthquake occur, severe ground shaking and\r\nliquefaction is expected to cause damage throughout the entire\r\ncircum-bay area nearly as severe as that resulting from a 1906-type\r\nearthquake on the San Andreas fault. This earthquake would be of\r\nparticular concern because of the many dams located along or near the\r\nfault.\r\n\r\n\r\n   4. Los Angeles/Newport-Inglewood Fault (Magnitude 7.5)\r\n\r\n      This earthquake would be a serious threat to the nearby,\r\ndensely-populated areas of Los Angeles. Shaking would cause extensive\r\nstructural damage throughout the Los Angeles Basin and liquefaction\r\nnear the coast would add still more destruction.\r\n\r\n\r\n   5. San Diego Area/Rose Canyon Fault (Magnitude 7.0)\r\n\r\n      This fault--a segment of an active zone of faults extending from\r\nthe Newport-Inglewood fault to Northern Mexico--would present the\r\ngreatest earthquake risk to the San Diego area. Severe damage due to\r\nshaking and liquefaction could be expected in the coastal areas.\r\nBecause of unstable sea-bed sediments in the offshore area, local\r\ntsunamis (tidal waves) are possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n   6. Los Angeles/Santa Monica Fault (Magnitude 6.7 and 7.0) and\r\n      Riverside/San Bernardino/Cucamonga Fault (Magnitude 6.8)\r\n\r\n      These faults are part of a system of east-west tending faults\r\nbordering the northern edge of the Los Angeles basin. This fault\r\nsystem caused the 1971 San Fernando earthquake and is geologically\r\nsimilar to the system that generated the large 1952 Kern County\r\nearthquake. Although smaller in magnitude than the earthquakes\r\npreviously described, these postulated events are potentially quite\r\ndangerous because of their vicinity to high population densities in\r\nSouthern California.\r\n\r\n\r\nD. EARTHQUAKE EFFECTS\r\n\r\nDetailed maps were prepared for each event showing qualitative\r\nestimates of ground shaking intensity resulting from each earthquake.\r\nThese estimates are indicative of the general severity of damage to\r\nordinary structures. Empirical formulae providing quantitative\r\nestimates of peak ground motion at various distances from the\r\npostulated earthquakes were developed for use in the effects of\r\nsevere ground shaking on individual structures or critical\r\nfacilities. No estimates were made of localized effects, such as\r\nground failures related to liquefaction (the complete failure or loss\r\nof strength, of a saturated soil due to shaking), landslides, and\r\nfault rupture. These effects can be far more destructive than ground\r\nshaking alone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 1. Geographic Locations of Selected Regional\r\nEvents]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nASSESSMENT OF LOSSES FOR SELECTED POTENTIAL CALIFORNIA EARTHQUAKES\r\n\r\n\r\nA. INTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nAs part of a program that FEMA and its predecessor agencies have had\r\nunderway for a number of years, property loss and casualty estimates\r\nwere prepared in 1972 and 1973 for a number of potential maximum\r\ncredible earthquakes that could impact on the San Francisco and the\r\nLos Angeles areas--North San Andreas (Richter magnitude 8.3), Hayward\r\n(Richter magnitude 7.4), South San Andreas (Richter magnitude 8.3),\r\nand Newport-Inglewood (Richter magnitude 7.5). These estimates have\r\nnow been updated as part of the current assessment.\r\n\r\nEstimates of property loss and casualties are based on the expected\r\ntype and distribution of damage for each postulated earthquake as\r\ndetermined by the size and location of the earthquake and the\r\ndistribution and character of the buildings and structures within the\r\naffected area. Methodologies for estimates of this type are\r\napproximate at best. Consequently, the figures shown below may vary\r\nupward or downward by as much as a factor of two or three. This degree\r\nof uncertainty does not affect the validity of the conclusions of this\r\nreport, however, since there are greater uncertainties in all other\r\naspects of emergency response planning.\r\n\r\n\r\nB. PROPERTY LOSS ESTIMATES\r\n\r\nThe property loss estimates were obtained by first estimating the\r\ntotal replacement dollar value of buildings and their contents,\r\nmultiplying them by percentage loss factors (inferred from the\r\nanticipated strength of shaking in each county), and then summing to\r\nobtain the aggregate loss. Included in the estimates are private as\r\nwell as Federal, State, and local government buildings, insured and\r\nuninsured. Excluded from consideration is the replacement value of\r\ntransportation and communication facilities, dams, utility\r\ninstallations, and special purpose structures (e.g., convention\r\ncenters and sports arenas). Also excluded is the potential damage\r\nresulting from a major dam failure or the indirect dollar losses due\r\nto such factors as higher unemployment, lower tax revenue, reduced\r\nproductivity, and stoppage of industrial production. Experience\r\nindicates that indirect losses could be approximately equal to the\r\ndollar amounts lost in buildings and their contents. The property loss\r\nestimates for four postulated earthquakes on the faults listed below\r\nare as follows.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE 2\r\n\r\nESTIMATES OF PROPERTY LOSSES FOR REPRESENTATIVE EARTHQUAKES[1]\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n                            Loss to          Loss of\r\n                            Building         Contents         Total Loss\r\nFault                   ($ in Billions)  ($ in Billions)  ($ in Billions)\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nNorthern San Andreas          25               13               38\r\nHayward                       29               15               44\r\nNewport-Inglewood             45               24               69\r\nSouthern San Andreas          11                6               17\r\n----------\r\n   [1] Uncertain by a possible factor of two to three.\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nC. CASUALTY ESTIMATES\r\n\r\nDeaths and injuries in these earthquakes principally would occur from\r\nfailures of man-made structures, particularly older, multistory, and\r\nunreinforced brick masonry buildings built before the institution of\r\nearthquake-resistant building codes. Experience has shown that some\r\nmodern multistory buildings--constructed as recently as the late\r\n1960's, but not adequately designed or constructed to meet the current\r\nunderstanding of requirements for seismic resistance--are also subject\r\nto failure. Consequently, the number of fatalities will be strongly\r\ninfluenced by the number of persons within high-occupancy buildings,\r\ncapable of collapsing, or by failure of other critical facilities such\r\nas dams. Additional imponderables are the degree of saturation of the\r\nground at the time of the event and the possibility of weather\r\nconditions conducive to the spread of fire. A conflagration such as\r\noccurred in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, is not considered\r\nlikely to occur in any of the analyzed events, however, because of\r\nimprovements in fire resistance of construction and firefighting\r\ntechniques. Nonetheless, numerous smaller fires must be anticipated in\r\nany of the analyzed events and a \"Santa Ana type\" wind could cause\r\nserious problems.\r\n\r\nAn additional element of uncertainty in estimating casualties from\r\nearthquake stems from not knowing where most of the population will be\r\nat the time of the earthquake. In the early morning (i.e., 2:30 a.m.)\r\nmost people are at home, by far the safest environment during a\r\nseismic emergency. At 2:00 in the afternoon, on the other hand, the\r\nmajority of people are at their places of employment and therefore\r\nvulnerable to collapse of office buildings. Around 4:30 p.m. many more\r\npeople are in the streets and thus subject to injury due to falling\r\ndebris or failures of transportation systems. Consequently, depending\r\non the time of day, wide variations in the number of casualties can be\r\nexpected.\r\n\r\nFollowing are estimates of dead and injured (requiring\r\nhospitalization) for each of the four representative faults and for\r\nthe three time periods just discussed.\r\n\r\nTABLE 3\r\n\r\nESTIMATES OF CASUALTIES[1]\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nFault                      Time         Dead     Hospitalized[2]\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nNorthern San Andreas     2:30 a.m.      3,000      12,000\r\n                         2:00 p.m.     10,000      37,000\r\n                         4:30 p.m.     11,000      44,000\r\n\r\nHayward                  2:30 a.m.      3,000      13,000\r\n                         2:00 p.m.      8,000      30,000\r\n                         4:30 p.m.      7,000      27,000\r\n\r\nSouthern San Andreas     2:30 a.m.     3,000       12,000\r\n                         2:00 p.m.     12,000      50,000\r\n                         4:30 p.m.     14,000      55,000\r\n\r\nNewport-Inglewood        2:30 a.m.      4,000      18,000\r\n                         2:00 p.m.     21,000      83,000\r\n                         4:30 p.m.     23,000      91,000\r\n----------\r\n   [1] Uncertain by a possible factor of two to three.\r\n\r\n   [2] Injuries not requiring hospitalization are estimated to be\r\n   from 15 to 30 times the number of deaths.\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nD. OVERVIEW OF OTHER TYPES OF DAMAGE\r\n\r\nFor this assessment, estimates of damage to substantial numbers of\r\ndifferent type facilities essential to the immediate response\r\ncapability were updated. Earthquakes associated with the same four\r\nmajor fault systems identified earlier in this chapter were used as a\r\nbasis for these estimates. The types of facilities analyzed included\r\n_hospitals_, _medical supply storages_, _blood banks_, and _custodial\r\ncare homes_, together with their essential services and personnel\r\nresources. Although newer hospitals in California are being built\r\naccording to substantially improved seismic safety standards and\r\npractices, older hospital facilities can be expected to be poorly\r\nresistant to earthquakes.\r\n\r\nAmong residential buildings, single family homes are expected to\r\nsuffer structural damage and loss of contents. Damage to multifamily\r\ndwellings--particularly older buildings--would, in all likelihood, be\r\nmore extensive. Analysis of expected damage indicates that temporary\r\nhousing for as many as 200,000 families might be needed--a requirement\r\ncalling for careful planning and exceptional management skills.\r\n\r\nSchools are judged to be among the safest facilities exposed to the\r\nearthquakes. Since passage of the Field Act in 1933, after the Long\r\nBeach earthquake, school buildings in California have been\r\ncontinuously improved to withstand seismic hazards.\r\n\r\nAs a result of continuing and substantial upgrading of design and\r\nconstruction practices in the past 10 years, dams and reservoirs can\r\nbe expected to show an improved performance in an earthquake.\r\nNonetheless, on a contingency basis, one dam failure might be assumed\r\nfor each planning effort.\r\n\r\nRealizing the fact that 84 key communications facilities, earth\r\nstations, Department of Defense voice and data switches, commercial\r\ntransoceanic cable heads, Federal Telecommunications System switches,\r\nand major direct distance dial switches are located within 55 miles of\r\neither Los Angeles or San Francisco, damage must be expected to occur.\r\nWith this realization, priorities have been assigned to all critical\r\ncircuits transiting the key facilities, based on established criteria\r\nof criticality of service continuity. _National warning systems\r\ncircuitry, command and control circuits, and circuits supporting\r\ndiplomatic negotiations_ (of which a high concentration exists in\r\nCalifornia) are examples of those circuits carrying high-restoration\r\npriority.\r\n\r\nIn the civil sector there would be 24 to 72 hours of minimal\r\ncommunications, with a possible blackout of telephonic communications\r\nin the area immediately following an earthquake. The commercial\r\ncarriers would institute network control procedures to regain control\r\nof the situation as fast as possible.\r\n\r\nThe impact on transportation facilities in any of the four\r\nhypothesized earthquakes could be massive. Since the magnitude and\r\nseverity is unprecedented in recent years, conclusions regarding\r\nlosses must be accepted as tentative. As in the case of hospitals,\r\nhowever, the lessons learned in earthquakes during the past 10 years\r\nare being incorporated in the design and construction of new\r\nfacilities.\r\n\r\nIn general, all major transportation modes would be\r\naffected--_highways_, _streets_, _overpasses and bridges_, _mass\r\ntransit systems_, _railroads_, _airports_, _pipelines_, and _ocean\r\nterminals_, although major variances in losses are expected among the\r\nmodes. From a purely structural standpoint, the more rigid or elevated\r\nsystems (such as railroads and pipelines) which cross major faults on\r\nan east-west axis would incur the heaviest damage, with initial losses\r\napproaching 100 percent. Other major systems (such as highways,\r\nairports, and pile-supported piers at water terminals) have better\r\nsurvivability characteristics and therefore would fare much better,\r\nwith damage generally in the moderate range of 15 to 30 percent. These\r\ntransportation facility loss estimates are stated in terms of\r\nimmediate post-quake effects. They do not reflect the impact of\r\npriority emergency recovery efforts and expedient alternatives that\r\nare available, some within hours, to aid in restoration of\r\ntransportation capacity. In addition, transportation systems generally\r\nhave an inherently significant degree of redundancy and flexibility.\r\nConsequently, an unquantified but significant movement capability in\r\nall transport modes is expected to survive. Finally, these loss\r\nestimates do not take into account the question of availability of\r\nessential supporting resources, particularly petroleum fuels,\r\nelectricity, and communications. In the initial response phase, these\r\ncould prove to be the most limiting factors in the capability of the\r\ntransportation system.\r\n\r\nBusiness and industry would be affected by damage to office buildings,\r\nplants, and other support facilities. Although the 1971 San Fernando\r\nearthquake occurred on the margin of a largely suburban area,\r\nindustrial facilities incurred significant damage. For example,\r\nseveral buildings of the kind commonly used for light industry or\r\nwarehouses suffered from collapsed roofs or walls. Generally, building\r\ncodes do not apply to special industrial facilities, and the ability\r\nof these structures to resist earthquake shaking will depend largely\r\non the foresight of the design engineer. For example, a major\r\nelectrical power switching yard and a water filtration plant were\r\nseriously damaged in the 1971 San Fernando earthquake.\r\n\r\nAbout 10 percent of the population and industrial resources of the\r\nNation are located in California. Over 85 percent of these resources\r\n(or about 8.5 percent of the Nation's total) are located in the 21\r\nCalifornia counties that are subject to the possibility of damage from\r\na major earthquake. Much of the aerospace and electronics industry is\r\ncentered in California. For example, about 56 percent of the guided\r\nmissiles and space vehicles, 40 percent of the semiconductors, 25\r\npercent of the electronic computer equipment, and approximately 21\r\npercent of the optical instruments and lenses manufactured in the\r\nNation are manufactured in these 21 counties. The probability that all\r\nthese counties would be affected by one earthquake is extremely\r\nremote; yet the significant concentration of key industries remains a\r\nconcern. For example, about 25 percent of the Nation's semiconductors\r\nare manufactured in Santa Clara County, an area along the Northern San\r\nAndres fault that suffered very heavy damage in the 1906 San Francisco\r\nearthquake. Estimates of damage to these industrial facilities and the\r\nresulting loss of production have not been made. Similarly, the\r\nresulting impact of possible damage to national production has not\r\nbeen adequately analyzed.\r\n\r\nFederally regulated financial institutions were generically analyzed\r\nto determine their ability to continue to promote essential services\r\nin the event of a major earthquake like those that have been\r\npostulated for this assessment. The conclusion reached thus far is\r\nthat large-magnitude earthquakes pose no significant or unanticipated\r\nproblems of solvency and liquidity for such institutions. The Federal\r\nReserve System and other regulatory entities have procedures in place\r\nthat are designed--and have been tested--specifically to provide for\r\nthe continued operation of financial institutions immediately\r\nfollowing an earthquake or other emergency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nAN ASSESSMENT OF THE CURRENT STATE OF READINESS CAPABILITY OF FEDERAL,\r\nSTATE, AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FOR EARTHQUAKE RESPONSE\r\n\r\n\r\nA. INTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nAn earthquake of catastrophic magnitude, with or without credible\r\nwarning, happens suddenly. The potential for disaster, however, does\r\nnot occur suddenly. The degree of preparedness and commitment to\r\ncomprehensive planning and mitigation programs for the inevitable\r\nevent will largely determine the degree of hardship to be experienced\r\nthrough loss of life, human suffering, property destruction, and the\r\nother related economic, social, and psychological aspects of\r\ndisruption to day-to-day community activities. The impacts can be\r\nreduced substantially from current expected levels through the\r\ndevelopment and implementation of improved and more widely practiced\r\nearthquake hazards reduction measures. These include _coordinated\r\nemergency preparedness plans and procedures_, _earthquake prediction\r\nand warning systems_, _improved construction techniques_, and\r\n_effective public education and information programs_.\r\n\r\nThe State of California Office of Emergency Services (OES) and FEMA\r\nconducted an analysis of the readiness capability for potential\r\ncatastrophic earthquakes in California at the Federal, State, and\r\nlocal government levels. The planning of 22 counties and 38 cities, of\r\n34 State agencies, and of 17 Federal organizations were reviewed with\r\nthe following objectives: (a) identify opportunities for improvement;\r\n(b) provide a basis for making decisions that would strengthen program\r\ndirection and planning efforts; and (c) specify resource needs and\r\npotential legislative initiatives. Annex 2 summarizes current Federal\r\nand California earthquake planning.\r\n\r\nThe environment in which preparedness planning in California occurs is\r\ncharacterized by the following observations of public expectations and\r\nattitudes:\r\n\r\n        » There is widespread public support for government\r\n          action.\r\n\r\n        » Most people have some ideas as to what government should\r\n          be doing.\r\n\r\n        » There is understanding of the need for hazard reduction\r\n          as well as emergency response planning.\r\n\r\n        » People are willing, in the abstract, to have government\r\n          funds spent for hazard mitigation.\r\n\r\n        » The public is not very satisfied with what government\r\n          officials have done.\r\n\r\n        » Public officials perceive that current preparedness\r\n          plans and response are inadequate at best.\r\n\r\nAs discussed below, the review indicates that all is not well in\r\nearthquake plans and preparedness. Current plans and preparedness are\r\njudged to be adequate for the \"moderate\" earthquakes most likely to\r\noccur frequently in California. By moderate it is meant an event\r\ncausing property damage on the order of $1 to $2 billion. Such an\r\nevent, however, will severely tax existing resources and provide a\r\nmajor test of management relationship among different governmental\r\njurisdictions and levels. For a catastrophic earthquake, current plans\r\nand preparedness are clearly inadequate, leading to a high likelihood\r\nthat Federal, State, and local response activities would become\r\ndisorganized and largely fail to perform effectively for an extended\r\nperiod of time.\r\n\r\n\r\nB. STATE AND LOCAL RESPONSE\r\n\r\nAlthough there are widely differing approaches, local emergency\r\nplanning in California generally consists of a basic plan and a series\r\nof contingency plans. The basic plan establishes the authority, sets\r\nforth references, addresses hazard vulnerability, states the planning\r\nassumptions, establishes an emergency services organization, assigns\r\ntasks, formulates a mutual aid system, and directs the development of\r\nspecific support annexes. For those hazards identified in the basic\r\nplan, a separate contingency plan is then developed to address the\r\nunique nature of the hazardous event. The contingency plan contains\r\nservice support plans for each of the functional operations, including\r\ndetailed standard operating procedures. The planning efforts of local\r\njurisdictions are coordinated with adjacent jurisdictions and the\r\nCalifornia OES for consistency.\r\n\r\nA plan is not considered complete without the support annexes which\r\nmake the plan operational. The survey undertaken for this assessment\r\ndisclosed that approximately 93 percent of the jurisdictions examined\r\nhave existing, basic plans; 50 percent have completed annexes; 28\r\npercent of the basic plans addressed an earthquake hazard\r\nvulnerability; 35 percent have planned for earthquake contingency; and\r\nonly 1 percent (one city) has a plan to respond to an earthquake\r\nprediction.\r\n\r\nAt the State level, the California OES, as an integral part of the\r\nGovernor's Office, functions as his immediate staff and coordinating\r\norganization in carrying out the State's emergency responsibilities.\r\nSpecific emergency assignments have been made to 34 State agencies by\r\nthe OES Director through a series of Administrative Orders. During\r\nemergencies the activities of these agencies and departments are\r\ncoordinated by the California OES.\r\n\r\nThe State OES is also responsible for maintaining and updating the\r\nCalifornia Emergency Plan (CEP) and associated readiness plans. As in\r\nthe case of local plans, the basic document is supported by\r\noperational annexes as listed below:\r\n\r\n    CONTINGENCY                       MUTUAL AID\r\n\r\n    Earthquake                        Fire and Rescue\r\n    Earthquake Prediction             Law Enforcement\r\n    Oil Spill                         Medical\r\n    Nuclear Blackmail                 Utilities\r\n    Reactor Accident                  Military Support\r\n    Radioactive Material Incident\r\n    Flood\r\n\r\n\r\n    SUPPORTING SYSTEMS                EMERGENCY RESOURCES\r\n                                      MANAGEMENT\r\n\r\n    Warning                           Construction and Housing\r\n    Emergency Broadcast System        Economic Stabilization\r\n    Emergency Public Information      Food\r\n    Intelligence Operations           Health\r\n    Radiological Defense              Industrial Production\r\n                                      Manpower\r\n                                      Petroleum\r\n                                      Telecommunications\r\n                                      Transportation\r\n                                      Utilities\r\n\r\nBased on this planning concept, the review assessed quantitatively the\r\npreparedness activities of the 34 State agencies that have\r\npreparedness responsibilities in accordance with the CEP. The\r\nquantitative data are listed in the following table.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE 4\r\n\r\nQUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT OF STATE PREPAREDNESS ACTIVITIES\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n                                     Number of   Percent of\r\n  Preparedness Element               Agencies    34 Agencies\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\r\nExistence of Plan                       22            65\r\nConduct of Exercises                    27            79\r\nPublic Education Activities             10            29\r\nPublic Information Activities            9            26\r\nOperational Capability                  32            94\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe quality of the plans, activities, and operational capabilities\r\nwere then evaluated on a scale of 1 (expected to fail/inadequate) to 5\r\n(expected to succeed well/adequate). The qualitative results are shown\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE 5\r\n\r\nQUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT OF STATE PREPAREDNESS ACTIVITIES\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Preparedness Element        Capability Rating\r\n----------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Planning                           2.67\r\n  Exercises                          2.64\r\n  Public Education                   1.44\r\n  Public Information                 1.50\r\n  Operational Capability             2.91\r\n----------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIt should be emphasized that these ratings apply to the State's\r\n_present_ level of planning and preparedness for response to a major\r\ndestructive earthquake (magnitude 8), not a moderate (San\r\nFernando-type) event.\r\n\r\n\r\nC. FEDERAL RESPONSE\r\n\r\nAt the Federal level the principal capability to respond to a\r\ncatastrophic earthquake in California resides in FEMA, the agency\r\nresponsible by law to coordinate Federal activities in all\r\nemergencies. FEMA has developed a basic plan for supplemental Federal\r\nassistance for a major earthquake in the San Francisco Bay area. This\r\nplan, however, covers only the emergency phase of response (first few\r\ndays of efforts to save lives and protect property). In addition, FEMA\r\nis participating in a broader effort concentrating in Southern\r\nCalifornia. This cooperative effort is getting under way with State\r\nand local governments, other Federal departments, voluntary agencies,\r\npracticing professions, business and commercial interests, labor,\r\neducators, and researchers. It is expected to develop an effective\r\nprogram to respond to an earthquake or a credible earthquake\r\nprediction in that part of the State. The emphasis is being placed on\r\n_public safety, reduction of property damage, self-help on the part of\r\nindividuals, socioeconomic impacts, improved response and long-range\r\nrecovery planning, mitigation activities, and public participation for\r\nboth the post-prediction and immediate post-earthquake periods_. This\r\npilot effort is expected to be usable in other highly seismic areas of\r\nCalifornia as well as in other States.\r\n\r\nIn the event of a catastrophic earthquake, a substantial number of\r\nFederal agencies would provide support to and be coordinated by FEMA.\r\nIllustrative are the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n   1. Department of Defense (DOD)\r\n\r\n      Initially, local military commanders may provide necessary\r\nsupport to save lives, alleviate suffering, or mitigate property\r\ndamage. Normally, additional DOD resources would not be committed\r\nuntil a presidential declaration of an emergency or major disaster.\r\nWhen this occurs, the Secretary of the Army is DOD Executive Agent for\r\nmilitary support. The Commander, Sixth U.S. Army, at the Presidio, San\r\nFrancisco, has been further delegated authority to coordinate disaster\r\nrelief operations in the western portion of the United States.\r\nExtensive planning and coordination have taken place between the Sixth\r\nU.S. Army and FEMA Region IX. DOD emergency functions include: _damage\r\nsurvey_, _search and rescue_, _emergency medical care_,\r\n_identification and disposition of dead_, _emergency debris\r\nclearance_, _emergency roads and bridge construction_, _airfield\r\nrepair_, and _identification and demolition of unsafe structures_.\r\nSpecific units have been identified to respond to an earthquake in any\r\nof the major population centers of California. For example, at this\r\ntime the following units would be prepared for commitment within 8\r\nhours after a disaster is declared by the President:\r\n\r\n        » Six medical units with a 1,320 bed capacity\r\n\r\n        » Seven helicopter units with 90 utility helicopters and\r\n          36 medium helicopters\r\n\r\n        » One Infantry brigade of 1,500 personnel\r\n\r\n        » Two engineer units with 78 pieces of heavy equipment\r\n\r\n        » Two transportation units with 124 cargo trucks and\r\n          trailers\r\n\r\nThese as well as additional DOD assets could be made available,\r\ncontingent on defense priorities.\r\n\r\n\r\n   2. The National Communication System\r\n\r\n      This Agency's plan, the \"National Plan for Communications Support\r\nin Emergencies and Major Disasters,\" provides for planning and using\r\nnational telecommunications assets and resources during presidentially\r\ndeclared emergencies and major disasters. The plan, which has been\r\nexercised repeatedly in past disasters, provides the management\r\nstructure and the communications staff to support FEMA. Restoration\r\npriorities have been assigned to all critical circuits.\r\n\r\n\r\n   3. Department of Transportation (DOT)\r\n\r\n      DOT has established an Office of Emergency Transportation. This\r\noffice has developed and maintains comprehensive emergency plans and\r\nprocedural manuals for natural disasters and other civil crises. It\r\nconstantly monitors the civil transportation system for indications of\r\npotential adverse impacts from all hazards. It conducts scheduled\r\nperiodic training and readiness exercises for DOT emergency personnel\r\nand maintains quick response cells and emergency operating facilities\r\nat DOT headquarters and in the field to provide an immediate reaction\r\ncapability. The system has been activated several times in the recent\r\npast (e.g., Three Mile Island, 1979 Energy/Fuel Crisis, Independent\r\nTruckers' Strike, and the Mt. St. Helens eruption).\r\n\r\n\r\nD. CONSIDERATIONS FOR IMPROVING RESPONSE CAPABILITY\r\n\r\nEarthquake prediction has not been incorporated into existing plans.\r\nResponse to predictions in the current environment, if given, would be\r\n_ad hoc_. The State of California has only a rudimentary plan and the\r\nFederal Government none. The City of Los Angeles has examined the\r\nproblem extensively, but only considers its own jurisdiction and has\r\nnot produced an actionable plan. Current planning for the recovery\r\nperiod is incomplete, uncoordinated, and not functional. State and\r\nlocal governments have done little to plan for the recovery period\r\nwhen, following the emergency lifesaving phase, efforts and resources\r\nare concentrated on restoring the functioning of the community. They\r\npresume that the Federal Government will \"step in\" after a\r\npresidential declaration. The Federal Government has an untested draft\r\nplan for the San Francisco area that is not fully coordinated with the\r\nState plans. Current Federal plans are geared to the provision of\r\nassistance on the order of a few hundred million dollars. Thus, there\r\nis little confidence that they would function under the requirements\r\nfor tens-of-billions-of-dollars and concomitant service demands.\r\n\r\nBoth Federal and State agencies need to commit the financial resources\r\nand assignment of personnel to maintain and enhance earthquake plans\r\nand preparedness. Earthquake preparedness, although responding to high\r\ndamage expectation, is still based upon a relatively low probability\r\noccurrence. When it is in competition with pressing social needs for a\r\nportion of limited resources, social needs tend to prevail at all\r\nlevels of government. Without a clear commitment, future development\r\nof earthquake preparedness, as in the past, is problematic and its\r\nimplementation is in considerable doubt. The Federal earthquake\r\npreparedness effort needs to focus on a high state of readiness.\r\n\r\nHistory in the area of natural hazard mitigation suggests that\r\nassignment of responsibility, even by the President, when not followed\r\nby leadership and regular oversight over the allocation of financial\r\nresources, seldom leads to programs which can be expected to function.\r\nThe same weakness is evidenced at the State and local government\r\nlevels with few exceptions. The stresses likely to occur in emergency\r\nresponse programs after a catastrophic earthquake will be such that\r\neffective response will require a cooperative, integrated effort among\r\ndifferent jurisdictions and levels of government.\r\n\r\nExperience in other areas of planning and preparedness, particularly\r\nfor civil defense, indicates that damage to existing programs occurs\r\nwhen the Federal Government raises expectations of the public and of\r\nother levels of government and then fails to follow through with\r\nimplementation and funding. It is better to maintain the _status quo_\r\nwith minor changes at the margin than to announce substantial program\r\ninitiatives and not meet their requirements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nAN ASSESSMENT OF THE SOCIAL IMPACTS\r\n\r\n\r\nOften, it is assumed that disasters leave masses of the population in\r\nthe impacted areas dazed and helpless and unable to cope with the new\r\nconditions, or that those not so immobilized panic or display\r\nantisocial behavior. Another common assumption is that local\r\ncommunities and organizations are rendered ineffective to handle the\r\nmany problems, leading to further disorganization, loss of morale, and\r\nrequiring the quick assertion of \"strong\" outside leadership and\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\nPractical experience and field studies of disasters indicate that\r\nthese assumptions are not necessarily correct. The widespread sharing\r\nof danger, loss, and deprivation produces an intimate cooperativeness\r\namong the survivors, which overcomes social isolation and provides a\r\nchannel for very close communication and expression and a major source\r\nof physical and emotional support and reassurance. This capacity seems\r\nto account for the resiliency of personality and social organization\r\nin dealing with threat and danger. It is also at the base of the\r\nability of social life to regenerate.\r\n\r\nIn addition, a good case can be made in that community systems\r\nexperiencing impact may be more efficient and rational than they are\r\nin \"normal\" circumstances. Normal (pre-disaster) community life\r\ntraditionally operates at a low level of effectiveness and efficiency.\r\nActivities are directed toward a very diffuse set of goals, just as\r\nhuman resources within the community are inadequately utilized. Upon\r\ndisaster impact, certain community goals--care for victims and the\r\nrestoration of essential services--develop a high priority while\r\nothers are ignored or held in abeyance. Thus, the entire range of\r\ncommunity resources, even taking into account \"losses,\" can be\r\nallocated to the accomplishment of the more critical goals. Also,\r\nhuman resources are better utilized. Many women, older persons,\r\nyounger persons, and members of minorities now become \"productive;\"\r\nthe \"labor\" market after impact is open to those underutilized\r\nresources. In effect, then, disasters create the conditions for the\r\nmore efficient utilization of material resources and the more\r\neffective mobilization of human resources.\r\n\r\nTo accomplish this, certain modifications have to occur in the normal\r\ncommunity structure, since the usual decision-making structures are\r\ndesigned for a different range and type of problem. Outsiders see this\r\nrestructuring process as disorganized, chaotic, and creating the\r\nnecessity for the imposition of some strong outside authority. On the\r\ncontrary, this restructuring process is functional and adaptive. Its\r\nconsequences are seen in communities and societies that rebound\r\ndramatically from the disruption and destruction to levels of\r\nintegration, productivity, and growth capacity far beyond the\r\npre-disaster state.\r\n\r\nIn summary, the picture drawn points to the capacity of individuals\r\nand institutions to deal with difficult problems created by disaster\r\nimpact. It also points to the adaptive capacity of social organization\r\nwithin communities to deal with unique and dramatic problems. These\r\nfindings are not an argument against planning nor against \"outside\"\r\nassistance, but they should condition both the nature of planning and\r\nthe direction of assistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANNEX 1\r\n\r\nLETTERS OF CORRESPONDENCE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WHITE HOUSE\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON\r\n\r\n\r\n  September 19, 1980\r\n\r\n  To Governor Jerry Brown\r\n\r\nAs you know, following my trip to view the destructive impacts of the\r\nvolcanic eruption of Mt. St. Helens in the State of Washington, I\r\ndirected that an assessment be undertaken of the consequences and\r\nstate of preparedness for a major earthquake in California. This\r\nreview, chaired by my Science and Technology Advisor, Frank Press, is\r\nnow complete. We are grateful for the assistance provided by your\r\nstaff and the other State, and local officials in this effort.\r\n\r\nAlthough current response plans are generally adequate for moderate\r\nearthquakes, Federal, State, and local officials agree that additional\r\npreparation is required to cope with a major earthquake. Prudence\r\nrequires, therefore, that we take steps to improve our preparedness.\r\n\r\nWhile the primary responsibility for preparedness rests with the State\r\nof California, its local governments and its people, the magnitude of\r\nhuman suffering and loss of life that might occur and the importance\r\nof California to the rest of the Nation require increased Federal\r\nattention to this important issue. Accordingly, I have directed that\r\nthe Federal government increase its work with you to supplement your\r\nefforts. The Federal efforts will be led by the Federal Emergency\r\nManagement Agency and include the Department of Defense and other\r\nDepartments and agencies as appropriate.\r\n\r\nAs a Nation, we must reduce the adverse impacts of a catastrophic\r\nearthquake to the extent humanly possible by increasing our\r\npreparedness for this potential eventuality.\r\n\r\n  Sincerely,\r\n\r\n  [signed] Jimmy Carter\r\n\r\n  The Honorable Edmund G. Brown, Jr.\r\n  Governor of California\r\n  Sacramento, California 95814\r\n\r\n\r\n  September 26, 1980\r\n\r\n  The Honorable Jimmy Carter\r\n  The President\r\n  The White House\r\n  Washington, D.C. 20500\r\n\r\n  Dear Mr. President:\r\n\r\nLet me take this opportunity to review our conversations over the last\r\nfew months regarding increased seismic activity in California.\r\n\r\nWhen we met in Oakland on July 4 I raised the issue of seismic\r\nhazards. I was concerned then with the steady increase in seismic\r\nactivity in California since 1978. Sharing my concern, you directed\r\nthat the National Security Council join with my staff and certain\r\nlocal experts to conduct a quick study on the potential for a great\r\nearthquake in California.\r\n\r\nAs you know, significant theoretical and public policy research had\r\nalready been completed by our Seismic Safety Commission, State\r\nGeologist, Earthquake Prediction Evaluation Council and the Office of\r\nEmergency Services. Together with the U.S. Geological Survey and the\r\nFederal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), they had clearly been\r\nkeeping abreast of the state of the art of earthquake prediction.\r\nIndeed, combined state and federal efforts, founded on major\r\ntheoretical advances in American, Russian and Chinese seismic and\r\ngeological theory since the early 1970s, had shifted the language of\r\nearthquake prediction in California from \"if\" to \"when\"!\r\n\r\nIn light of my personal interest in this subject, I have signed into\r\nlaw Assemblyman Frank Vicencia's AB 2202, a jointly funded\r\nstate-federal project to design a comprehensive earthquake\r\nprediction-response plan. It is the state's intention to prepare a\r\nplan for the greater Los Angeles area as quickly as feasible. In my\r\nview, such a fullscale prediction-response program had become possible\r\nonly after the research findings of both physical and policy\r\nscientists during the past five years. It is my conviction that such a\r\nplan is now timely--neither too early nor too late.\r\n\r\nIn this context, your recognition of this issue in our conversation of\r\nSeptember 22 in Los Angeles was a welcome personal reinforcement of\r\nour state and local efforts. I am also grateful for the September 3\r\nbriefing in Sacramento by Mr. John Macy, Director of FEMA, regarding\r\nthe latest U.S. Geological Survey interpretations of anomalies around\r\nCalifornia's system of geological faults. As soon as we have received\r\nthe final FEMA report on the details of those anomalies, I will ask\r\nthe state geologist to evaluate the report, confer with colleagues in\r\nthe Geological Survey and have all state and local officials fully\r\nbriefed.\r\n\r\nAt that time, I would be grateful for an early opportunity to meet\r\nwith you and explore next steps. I am confident that a heightened\r\nstate of awareness among my fellow Californians will so deploy the\r\nresources of the state, plus available federal supplementary\r\nassistance, as to minimize the loss of life and property in the event\r\nof a great earthquake.\r\n\r\n  Sincerely,\r\n\r\n  /s/\r\n\r\n  Edmund G. Brown, Jr.\r\n  Governor\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANNEX 2\r\n\r\nCURRENT CALIFORNIA AND FEDERAL EARTHQUAKE RESPONSE PLANNING\r\n\r\n\r\nA. NATURE OF EMERGENCY PLANNING\r\n\r\nAn emergency, as used in this report, is defined as an unexpected,\r\nsudden or out-of-the-ordinary event or series of events adversely\r\naffecting lives and property which, because of its magnitude, cannot\r\nbe handled by normal governmental processes. Emergency response\r\nplanning is the process that addresses preparedness for and response\r\nto an emergency.\r\n\r\nEmergency response planning is an evolutionary, ongoing process and is\r\nprerequisite to all other emergency readiness activities. It is a\r\ncomprehensive process that identifies the potential hazardous events,\r\nand the vulnerability to such hazards, estimates expected losses, and\r\nassesses impacts of such events. The development of written plans is\r\nfollowed by placement of capabilities to implement the response plan\r\nand by the conduct of periodic tests and exercises. The most difficult\r\ntask in the development of an emergency plan is to anticipate as many\r\nof the problems and complications resulting from a given disaster\r\nsituation as possible and to provide a basis for response to those not\r\nanticipated.\r\n\r\nThe objective of emergency planning is to create the capacity for\r\ngovernment to:\r\n\r\n        » Save the maximum number of lives in the event of an\r\n          emergency\r\n\r\n        » Minimize injuries and protect property\r\n\r\n        » Preserve the functions of civil government\r\n\r\n        » Maintain and support economic and social activities\r\n          essential for response and the eventual long-term\r\n          recovery from the disaster\r\n\r\nEmergency planning is a logical and necessary pre-emergency activity\r\nfor governmental (and other organizational) entities likely to be\r\naffected by a disaster's occurrence. To be successful, such planning\r\nmust be accomplished within the framework of the day-to-day\r\ngovernmental structure and activity but at the same time provide for\r\nresponse to the extraordinary circumstances and requirements inherent\r\nin disaster situations.\r\n\r\nEmergency plans include the preparation of guidelines, policy\r\ndirectives, and procedures to be utilized in preparing for and\r\nconducting disaster operations, training, and test exercises. They\r\nshould also contain clear statements of authorities, responsibilities,\r\norganizational relationships, and operating procedures necessary for\r\nthe accomplishment of disaster response and recovery activities.\r\nFurther, they should address the four elements of mitigation,\r\npreparedness, response, and recovery (immediate and long-term).\r\n\r\nOnce plans are established they must be periodically updated as\r\nconditions change. Updating may become necessary for a number of\r\nreasons: increased scientific, technical, and managerial knowledge;\r\nfeedback from evaluation of exercises; better understanding of\r\nvulnerability; shifts in population and economic activities;\r\nconstruction of new critical facilities; and changes in personnel,\r\norganization, and legislation.\r\n\r\nEmergency planning is a shared responsibility at all levels--in this\r\ncase from the Federal through the State and local jurisdictional\r\nlevels. It should include business, industry, research and scientific\r\ninstitutions, practicing professions, and the individuals. By\r\ninvolving all functions of government, the planning process enhances\r\nthe capability for implementing the plans through the realistic\r\nconsideration of available capabilities and elimination of conflicts\r\nand inconsistencies of roles and task assignments.\r\n\r\nFurther, by being a part of the planning decision-making process and\r\nhaving identified the needs and areas of consideration, individuals,\r\norganizations, and officials responsible for emergency operations are\r\nbetter able to relate to the expected impact and the operational\r\nenvironment. The written plans also serve valuable purposes for\r\ntraining and familiarization of new organizations, individuals, and\r\npublic officials. Experience has shown repeatedly that when emergency\r\noperations are conducted in accordance with existing plans, reaction\r\ntime is reduced and coordination improved, with fewer casualties, less\r\nproperty damage, and a higher surviving socioeconomic capability to\r\nundertake recovery. Other benefits that accrue from planning include\r\nthe enhancement of hazard awareness.\r\n\r\n\r\nB. CALIFORNIA EMERGENCY PLANNING RESPONSE\r\n\r\nThe State of California emergency response planning is a series of\r\nrelated documents, each of which serve a specific purpose. (See\r\nfigures 1 and 2.)\r\n\r\nThe basic plan of a jurisdiction (item (1) in figures 1 and 2) is the\r\nfoundation of this planning process. It is an essential administrative\r\n(rather than operational) document, and as such it:\r\n\r\n        » Provides the basis (including legal authority) for and\r\n          the objectives of emergency planning and operations\r\n\r\n        » Outlines contingencies (emergency situations) to be\r\n          planned and prepared for and establishes the general\r\n          principles and policies (concepts of operations) to be\r\n          applied to each\r\n\r\n        » Describes the emergency organization in terms of who is\r\n          responsible for what actions\r\n\r\n        » Defines interjurisdictional and interservice\r\n          relationships and the direction and control structure to\r\n          make assignments and resolve conflicts\r\n\r\n        » Contains or refers to information of common interest\r\n          about supporting facilities, such as the Emergency\r\n          Operations Center and warning and communications systems\r\n\r\n        » Provides the planning basis for other supporting\r\n          documents which are more operationally oriented\r\n\r\nThe basic plan is supported by a Direction and Control annex and by\r\nfunctional annexes (see (2) and (3) respectively in figures 1 and 2).\r\nThe Direction and Control annex details how overall responses to an\r\nemergency will be managed and coordinated. Functional annexes (for\r\nboth staff and services) are designed to address the extraordinary\r\nrequirements created by emergencies. They identify the specific needs,\r\nthe organizational resources available to meet those needs, and the\r\nscheme or \"concept of operations\" for their application. It should be\r\nnoted that, because of unique requirements, annexes often do not\r\nreflect normal departmental structure. An annex becomes a departmental\r\nplan only when an agency represents the sole resource for meeting the\r\nstated need and when satisfying that need is the only task assigned to\r\nthat agency by the basic plan.\r\n\r\nThe second major portion of the California State planning structure\r\nconsists of specific contingency plans (see (4) in figures 1 and 2).\r\nOne such plan is prepared for each extraordinary emergency or\r\ndisaster, likely to occur, detailing the probable effects of the\r\nemergency on the jurisdiction and the actions to be taken in\r\noffsetting these effects. It is also called a \"response plan\" since it\r\ndescribes the operations to be undertaken to deal with catastrophic\r\nsituations. Contingency plans include service support plans and\r\nchecklists (see (5) and (6) respectively in figures 1 and 2). Each\r\ninvolved element of the emergency organization details its response\r\nactions in Service Support Plans and itemizes functions appropriate to\r\nthe specific contingency. The contingency plans, service support\r\nplans, and related checklists and standard operating procedures\r\nconstitute the \"operational\" portions of the overall emergency plan.\r\nThey address internal procedures to accomplish stated objectives and\r\ndocument, in advance, the specific organizational elements that will\r\nrespond to each type of disaster or \"need,\" with identification of\r\nprocedures and resources.\r\n\r\nThe third major part of California's overall State plan is a\r\ncompendium of information and resources needed to cope with\r\nemergencies (see (7) in figures 1 and 2). This includes references\r\ndescribing the control structure (Emergency Operations Center\r\nlocations, communications, key facilities, personnel lists, and\r\nequipment source listings).\r\n\r\n\r\nC. FEDERAL EARTHQUAKE RESPONSE PLANNING\r\n\r\nMost Federal agencies operating within the State have a generic\r\nemergency response plan that establishes their internal procedures for\r\nresponding to disasters. Certain agencies such as the Corps of\r\nEngineers and the Federal Highway Administration, which provide\r\nservices and support that are used on a regular and fairly extensive\r\nbasis in disaster, tend to have more highly developed disaster\r\nresponse plans. Some of them even have rather basic earthquake\r\nresponse segments included in their basic plans. Thus, for moderate\r\nearthquakes these plans are relatively effective and the Federal\r\nresponse can be expected to be at least adequate. Few Federal\r\nagencies, however, have developed any specific plan that is adequate\r\nto respond to the demands of a catastrophic event causing property\r\ndamage exceeding the $2 billion range. Of 24 Federal agencies whose\r\nearthquake planning status were recently evaluated by FEMA Region IX,\r\nonly the Sixth U.S. Army was determined to have developed a\r\ncomprehensive capability that is in acceptable detail, has been\r\nexercised, and appears to be operationally adequate and reliable.\r\nOther Federal agencies are now beginning to perceive the need to\r\nimprove their planning and response capability following the expected\r\nevent, and are gradually responding to this need.\r\n\r\nProviding impetus to this expanded planning activity has been the\r\nemergence of the FEMA Region IX Earthquake Response Plan for the San\r\nFrancisco Bay Area. This is a site-specific FEMA plan based on a 1974\r\ndraft that provided for a full range of Federal assistance during the\r\nemergency lifesaving phase following the earthquake. Although this\r\nplan never proceeded beyond the draft stage (because of evolving FEMA\r\ndisaster field operations policy), it served as the basic guide for\r\nthe development of the Sixth U.S. Army Plan, and has remained a core\r\ndocument for identifying expected Federal agency activities for\r\nearthquake recovery in the San Francisco Bay area. In 1979, the\r\nemergency response portion of the 1974 FEMA Region IX draft was\r\nrestructured. The conduct of the post-event response program was\r\nshifted from being a centrally directed FEMA activity under the\r\noperational control of the Regional Director to a decentralized\r\noperation which provides for functional disaster support activities to\r\nbe assigned by the Regional Director to certain Federal agencies by\r\nMission Assignment Letters. Table 1 indicates functional task\r\nassignment areas. Those with the designation \"Emergency Support\r\nFunction (ESF),\" have been assigned to other Federal agencies. Table 2\r\nreviews the principal and support agency assignments for each of the\r\nESF functions.\r\n\r\nOn the basis of these anticipated mission assignments, the tasked\r\nFederal agencies participated in the development of operational\r\nannexes in the 1979 version of the San Francisco Earthquake Response\r\nPlan. Upon completion of the annexes, all agencies were then required\r\nto develop the necessary agency support plans and standard operating\r\nprocedures for accomplishing the mission assignment tasks.\r\nAdditionally, those Federal agencies designated in the plan as\r\nprincipal agencies were tasked with the responsibility of organizing\r\nand coordinating the activities of Federal agencies designated as\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\nThe rationale for this approach was to identify the various functional\r\nareas of disaster response for which a Federal activity could\r\nreasonably be expected to maintain after the occurrence of the event.\r\nWith the functional areas identified, the range of Federal agency\r\ntalent was evaluated and Federal response capabilities matched to\r\nexpected functional demands. By the development of a matrix (figure\r\n2), a total of 16 functional response areas (such as transportation,\r\nmass care, and debris removal) were identified, and 20 Federal\r\nagencies, plus volunteer organizations such as the American National\r\nRed Cross, were designated as having appropriate disaster response\r\ncapabilities. Subsequently, all agencies were rated on their\r\ncapability for functioning in a principal or a support capacity. These\r\nagencies were then provided specific FEMA Region IX Mission\r\nAssignments or tasking statements which, when triggered by a\r\nPresidential disaster declaration, provide the legal basis for\r\ndelivering the authorized assistance in response to State and local\r\ngovernment needs.\r\n\r\nThe end result of this approach has been to create a much more\r\neffective and reliable capability to respond to the needs of an\r\nearthquake disaster by those Federal agencies from which a significant\r\nresponse would be required.\r\n\r\n          +----------+\r\n          |Basic Plan|                  .\r\n          |   (1)    |                  .\r\n          +----------+                  .\r\n           |     |  |                   .\r\n           |     |  |                   .        +-----------------+\r\n           |     |  +----------------------------|Contingency Plans|\r\n           |     |                      .        |      (4)        |\r\n           |     |                      .        +-----------------+\r\n           |     | Administrative       .

This action was initiated in January 1980 through the\r\nactions of the Assembly Committee on Government Organization, Frank\r\nVicencia, Chairman. Inclusions of specific funds for preparedness was\r\nincluded following a subcommittee on Emergency Planning and Disaster\r\nRelief hearing on possible earthquake prediction on April 22, 1980.\r\nThe text of the Law follows:\r\n\r\n                 Assembly Bill No. 2202\r\n\r\n                 CHAPTER 1046\r\n\r\n            An act to amend Section 8897 of, to amend and\r\n          renumber Section 8898 of, and to add Section\r\n          8895.1 to, the Government Code, relating to the\r\n          Seismic Safety Commission, making an appropriation\r\n          therefor, and declaring the urgency thereof, to\r\n          take effect immediately.\r\n\r\n          [Approved by Governor September 25, 1980.

The California\r\n          Emergency Services Act confers various related\r\n          powers and duties upon the Governor, the Director\r\n          and the Department of Emergency Services, and the\r\n          California Emergency Council.\r\n\r\n            This bill would amend the Seismic Safety\r\n          Commission Act by: changing the basic subject of\r\n          the powers and duties of the commission to\r\n          earthquake hazard mitigation and making certain\r\n          corresponding changes in its powers and duties;\r\n          including within commission responsibilities,\r\n          scheduling on its agenda as required, a report on\r\n          disaster mitigation issues from the Office of\r\n          Emergency Services and defining, for such\r\n          purposes, \"disaster\" as all natural hazards which\r\n          could have an impact on public safety; and\r\n          authorizing the commission to exercise various\r\n          specified powers in relation to other disasters,\r\n          as so defined, in connection with issues or items\r\n          reported or discussed with the Office of Emergency\r\n          Services at any commission meeting.\r\n\r\n            This bill would also require the commission to\r\n          initiate, as specified, a comprehensive program to\r\n          prepare the state for responding to a major\r\n          earthquake prediction, as specified.\r\n\r\n            This bill would appropriate $750,000 for the\r\n          purposes of this act.\r\n\r\n            This act would take effect immediately as an\r\n          urgency statute.\r\n\r\n            Appropriation: yes.\r\n\r\n\r\n          _The people of the State of California do enact\r\n          as follows:_\r\n\r\n            SECTION 1. Section 8895.1 is added to the\r\n          Government Code, to read:\r\n\r\n            8895.1. The commission shall initiate, with the\r\n          assistance and participation of other state,\r\n          federal, and local government agencies, a\r\n          comprehensive program to prepare the state for\r\n          responding to a major earthquake prediction. The\r\n          program should be implemented in order to result\r\n          in specific tools or products to be used by\r\n          governments in responding to an earthquake\r\n          prediction, such as educational materials for\r\n          citizens.
