In the present volume we are chiefly concerned\r\nwith man's application of the same principles in his efforts to set at\r\ndefiance, so far as may be, the limitations of time and space.\r\n\r\nSomething has already been said as to the contrast between the\r\nmaterial civilization of to-day and that of the generations prior to\r\nthe nineteenth century. The transformation in methods of agriculture\r\nand manufacture has been referred to somewhat in detail. Now we\r\nhave to do with contrasts that are perhaps even more vivid, since\r\nthey concern conditions that come within the daily observation of\r\neveryone. Steamships, locomotives, electric cars, and automobiles,\r\nare such commonplaces of every-day life that it is difficult to\r\nconceive a world in which they have no part. Yet everyone is aware\r\nthat all these mechanisms are inventions of the nineteenth century.\r\nMeantime the aeroplane, which bids fair to rival those other means\r\nof transportation in the near future, is a creation of the twentieth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nIn order to visualize the contrast between the practical civilization\r\nof to-day and that of our grandparents, it suffices to recall that the\r\nfirst steam locomotive that carried passengers over a railway was put\r\nin operation in the year 1829; and that the first ship propelled by\r\nsteam power alone did not cross the ocean until 1838. Not until well\r\ntowards the middle of the nineteenth century, then, were the conditions\r\nof transportation altered materially from what they had been since the\r\nvery dawn of civilization,--conditions under which one hundred miles\r\nconstituted about the maximum extent of a hard day's land journey.\r\n\r\nThe elaboration of railway and steamship lines through which nearly\r\nall portions of the habitable globe have been made accessible, has\r\nconstituted one of the most remarkable examples of economic development\r\nthat man has ever achieved. It requires but the slightest use of the\r\nimagination to realize with some measure of vividness the extent to\r\nwhich the entire structure of present-day civilization is based upon\r\nthis elaboration of means of transportation. To point but a single\r\nillustration, the entire central and western portion of the United\r\nStates must have remained a wilderness for decades or centuries had not\r\nthe steam locomotive made communication easy between these regions and\r\nthe seaboard.\r\n\r\nContrariwise no such development of city life as that which we see\r\nthroughout Christendom would have been possible but for the increased\r\nfacilities, due primarily to locomotives and steamships, for bringing\r\nall essential food-stuffs from distant regions.\r\n\r\nWhat this all means when applied on a larger scale may be suggested\r\nby the reflection that the entire character of the occupation of the\r\naverage resident of England has been changed within a century. A\r\ncentury ago England was a self-supporting nation, in the sense that\r\nit produced its own food-stuffs. To-day the population of England as\r\na whole is dependent upon food shipped to it from across the oceans.\r\nObviously such a transformation could never have been effected had\r\nnot the application of steam revolutionized the entire character of\r\ntransportation.\r\n\r\nFar-reaching as are the economic aspects of the problem of\r\ntransportation, this extraordinary revolution, the effects of which\r\nare visible on every side, has been brought about by the application\r\nof only a few types of mechanisms. The steam engine, the dynamo, and\r\nthe gas engine are substantially responsible for the entire development\r\nin question. In the succeeding pages, which deal with the development\r\nof steamships, locomotives, automobiles, and flying machines, we have\r\nto do with the application of principles with which our previous\r\nstudies have made us familiar; and in particular with the mechanisms\r\nthat have engaged our attention in the preceding volume. Yet the\r\napplication of these principles and the utilization of these mechanisms\r\ngave full opportunity for the exercise of inventive ingenuity, and\r\nthe story of the development of steamships, locomotives, electric\r\nvehicles, automobiles, gyro cars, and flying machines, will be found\r\nto have elements of interest commensurate with the importance of these\r\nmechanisms themselves. Before we take up these stories in detail,\r\nhowever, we shall briefly review the story of geographical discovery\r\nand exploration in its scientific aspects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nTHE CONQUEST OF THE ZONES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe contrast between modern and ancient times is strikingly suggested\r\nby reflection on the limited range of geographical knowledge of those\r\nOriental and Classical nations who dominated the scene at that remote\r\nperiod which we are accustomed to characterize as the dawn of history.\r\nThe Egyptians, peopling the narrow valley of the Nile, scarcely had\r\ndirect dealings with any people more remote than the Babylonians\r\nand Assyrians occupying the valley of the Euphrates. Babylonians\r\nand Assyrians in turn were in touch with no Eastern civilization\r\nmore remote than that of Persia and India, and knew nothing of any\r\nWestern world beyond the borders of Greece. Greeks and Romans, when\r\nin succession they came to dominate the world stage,--developing a\r\ncivilization which even as viewed from our modern vantage-ground seems\r\nmarvelous,--were still confined to narrow strips of territory about the\r\nshores of the Mediterranean, and had but the vaguest notions as to any\r\nother regions of the earth.\r\n\r\nIn the later classical period, to be sure, the globe was subjected,\r\nas we have seen, to wonderful measurements by Eratosthenes and by\r\nPosidonius, and the fact that man's abiding place is a great ball\r\nutterly different from the world as conceived by the Oriental mind,\r\nwas definitely grasped and became more or less a matter of common\r\nknowledge. It was even conceived that there might be a second habitable\r\nzone on the opposite side of the equator from the region in which\r\nthe Greeks and Romans found themselves, but as to just what this\r\nhypothetical region might be like, and as to what manner of beings\r\nmight people it, even the most daring speculator made no attempt\r\nto decide. The more general view, indeed, precluded all thought of\r\nhabitable regions lying beyond the confines of the Mediterranean\r\ncivilization; conceiving rather that the world beyond was a mere waste\r\nof waters.\r\n\r\nDoubtless the imaginative mind of the period must have chafed under\r\nthese restrictions of geographical knowledge; and now and again a more\r\ndaring navigator must have pressed out beyond the limits of safety,\r\ninto the Unknown, never to return. Once at least, even in the old\r\nEgyptian days, a band of navigators surpassing in daring all their\r\npredecessors, and their successors of the ensuing centuries, made bold\r\nto continue their explorations along the coast of Africa till they had\r\npassed to a region where--as Herodotus relates with wonder--the sun\r\nappeared \"on their right hand,\" ultimately passing about the southern\r\nextremity of the African continent and in due course completing the\r\ncircumnavigation, returning with wonder tales to excite the envy,\r\nperhaps, but not the emulation of their fellows.\r\n\r\nThen in due course some Phœnician or Greek navigators coasted along the\r\nnorthern shores beyond the \"Pillars of Hercules\" and discovered at the\r\nvery confines of the world what we now term the British Isles. But this\r\nwas the full extent of exploration throughout antiquity; and the spread\r\nof civilization about the borders of the known world was a slow and\r\nhaphazard procedure during all those centuries that mark the Classical\r\nand Byzantine periods.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MARINER'S COMPASS\r\n\r\nThe change came with that revival of scientific learning which was\r\nto usher in the new era that we speak of as modern times. And here\r\nas always it was a practical mechanism that gave the stimulus to new\r\nendeavor. In this particular case the implement in question was the\r\nmariner's compass, which consists, in its essentials, as everyone is\r\naware, of a magnetized needle floated or suspended in such a way that\r\nit is made under the influence of terrestrial magnetism to point to the\r\nnorth and south.\r\n\r\nThe mysterious property whereby the magnetized needle obeys this\r\ninscrutable impulse is, in the last analysis, inexplicable even to\r\nthe science of our day. But the facts, in their cruder relations,\r\nhad been familiar from time immemorial to a nation whose habitat lay\r\nbeyond the ken of the classical world--namely, the Chinese. It seems\r\nto be fairly established that navigators of that nation had used the\r\nmagnetized needle, so arranged as to constitute a crude compass, from\r\na period possibly antedating the Christian Era. To Western nations,\r\nhowever, the properties of the magnetized needle seem to have\r\nbeen quite unknown--at least its possibilities of practical aid to\r\nthe navigator were utterly unsuspected--until well into the Middle\r\nAges. There is every reason to believe--though absolute proof is\r\nlacking--that a knowledge of the compass came to the Western world from\r\nthe Far East through the medium of the Arabs. The exact channel of\r\nthis communication will perhaps always remain unknown. Nor have we any\r\nclear knowledge as to the exact time when the all-important information\r\nwas transmitted. We only know that manuscripts of the twelfth century\r\nmentioned the magnetic needle as an implement familiar to navigators,\r\nand from this time forward, we may feel sure, the new possibilities of\r\nexploration made possible by the compass must have suggested themselves\r\nto some at least of the more imaginative minds of each generation.\r\nIndeed there were explorers in each generation who pushed out a little\r\ninto the unknown, as the discovery of various groups of Islands in\r\nthe Atlantic shows, although the efforts of these pioneers have been\r\neclipsed by the spectacular feat of Columbus.\r\n\r\nThe exact steps by which the crude compass of the Orientals was\r\ndeveloped into the more elaborate and delicate instrument familiar to\r\nWestern navigators cannot be traced by the modern historian. It is\r\nknown that sundry experiments were made as to the best form of needle,\r\nand in particular as to the best way of adjusting it on approximately\r\nfrictionless bearings. But a high degree of perfection in this regard\r\nhad been attained before the modern period; and the compass had\r\nbeen further perfected by attaching the needle to a circumferential\r\ncard on which the \"points of the compass,\" thirty-two in number,\r\nwere permanently marked. At all events the compass card had been so\r\ndivided before the close of the fourteenth century, as is proved by\r\na chance reference by Chaucer. The utility of the instrument thus\r\nperfected--indeed its entire indispensableness--was doubtless by this\r\ntime clearly recognized by all navigators; and one risks nothing in\r\nsuggesting that without the compass no such hazardous voyage into the\r\nunknown as that of Columbus would ever have been attempted.\r\n\r\nNo doubt the earliest observers of the needle believed that it pointed\r\ndirectly to the North. If such were indeed the fact the entire science\r\nof navigation would be vastly simpler than it is. But it required no\r\nvery acute powers of observation to discover that the magnetized needle\r\ndoes not in reality point directly towards the earth's poles. There\r\nare indeed places on the earth where it does so point, but in general\r\nit is observed to deviate by a few degrees from the exact line of the\r\nmeridian. Such deviation is technically known as magnetic declination.\r\nThat this declination is not the same for all places was discovered by\r\nColumbus in the course of his first transatlantic voyage.\r\n\r\nA century or so later, the accumulated records made it clear that\r\ndeclination is not a fixed quantity even at any given place. An\r\nEnglishman, Stephen Burrows, is credited with making the discovery\r\nthat the needle thus shifts its direction slightly with the lapse\r\nof time, and the matter was more clearly determined a little later\r\nby Gillebrand, Professor of Geometry at Graham College. Dr. Halley,\r\nthe celebrated astronomer--whose achievements have been recalled to\r\nsucceeding generations by the periodical return of the comet that bears\r\nhis name--gave the matter attention, and in a paper before the Royal\r\nSociety in 1692 he pointed out that the direction of the needle at\r\nLondon had changed in a little over a century (between 1580 and 1692)\r\nfrom 11 degrees 15 minutes East to 6 degrees West, or more than 17\r\ndegrees.\r\n\r\nHalley conclusively showed that similar variations occurred at all\r\nother places where records had been kept. He had already demonstrated,\r\na few years earlier, that the deviations of the compass noted at sea\r\nare not due to the varying attractions of neighboring bodies of land,\r\nbut to some influence having to do with the problem of terrestrial\r\nmagnetism in its larger aspects. Halley advocated the doctrine, which\r\nhad first been put forward by William Gilbert, that the earth itself\r\nis a gigantic magnet, and that the action of the compass is dependent\r\nupon this terrestrial source and not, as many navigators believed, on\r\nthe influence of a magnetic star, or on localized deposits of lodestone\r\nsomewhere in the unknown regions of the North.\r\n\r\nFurther observations of the records presently made it clear that there\r\nare also annual and even daily variations of the compass of slight\r\ndegree. The fact of diurnal variations was first discovered by Mr.\r\nGraham about the year 1719. More than half a century later it was\r\nobserved by an astronomer named Wales, who was accompanying Captain\r\nCook on his famous voyage round the world (1772-74), that there is yet\r\nanother fluctuation of the compass due to the influence of the ship\r\non which it is placed. Considerable quantities of iron were of course\r\nused in the construction of wooden ships, and it was made clear that\r\nthe ship itself comes under the influence of the earth's magnetism and\r\nexerts in turn an appreciable influence on the compass. The fluctuation\r\ndue to this source is known as deviation, in contradistinction to the\r\nlarger fluctuation already referred to as declination.\r\n\r\nNot only is the deviation due to the ship's influence a matter of\r\nimportance, but it was discovered by Captain Matthew Flinders, in the\r\ncourse of his explorations along the coast of New Holland in the year\r\n1801-02, that the influence of the ship over its compass varies with\r\nthe direction of the ship's prow.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, the problem of the deviation of the compass due to the\r\ninfluence of the ship is enormously complicated when the ship instead\r\nof being constructed chiefly of wood is made of iron or steel. It then\r\nbecomes absolutely essential that the influence of vessels shall be\r\nreckoned with and so far as possible compensated. Such compensation may\r\nbe effected by the adjustment of bodies of iron, as first suggested\r\nby Barlow, or by the use of permanent magnets, as first attempted\r\nby England's Astronomer Royal, Professor Airy. At the very best,\r\nhowever, it is never possible totally to overcome the ship's perverting\r\ninfluence, allowance for which must be made if an absolutely accurate\r\nconclusion is to be drawn from the record presented by the compass.\r\n\r\nEarly in the twentieth century an American ship, christened the\r\n_Carnegie_, in honor of the philanthropist who supplied funds for the\r\nenterprise, was constructed for the express purpose of making accurate\r\ncharts of the lines of magnetic declination in various parts of the\r\nglobe. This ship differs from every other vessel of considerable size\r\never hitherto constructed in that no magnetic material of any kind\r\nwas used in connection with its structure or equipment. For the most\r\npart iron was substituted by copper or other non-magnetic metal.\r\nPins of locust-wood largely took the place of nails; and wherever it\r\nwas not feasible to do away with iron altogether it was used in the\r\nform of non-magnetic manganese steel. The purpose of the _Carnegie_\r\nis to provide accurate charts of magnetic declination for the use\r\nof navigators in general. The value of observations made with this\r\nnon-magnetic ship will be clear when it is reflected that with an\r\nordinary ship the observer can never be absolutely certain as to what\r\nprecise share of the observed fluctuation of the compass is due at any\r\ngiven moment to the ship's influence. In other words--using technical\r\nterminology--he can never apportion with absolute accuracy the\r\ninfluence of declination and of deviation. Yet it is highly important\r\nthat he should be able to do so, inasmuch as the declination of the\r\ncompass is an all-important element in reckoning the exact location of\r\nthe ship, and would be the same for every ship at that place, whereas\r\ndeviation denotes a purely local disturbance which would never be the\r\nsame for any two ships of different construction.\r\n\r\nNot only does the magnetized needle thus tend to vary in the direction\r\nof its horizontal action, but it also tends when suspended at the\r\nmiddle to shift its vertical axis. In regions near the equator, indeed,\r\nthe magnetized needle maintains a horizontal position, but if carried\r\ninto northern or southern latitudes it progressively \"dips,\" its\r\npolar end sinking lower and lower. This dipping of the needle seems\r\nto have been first observed by Robert Norman, an English nautical\r\ninstrument maker, about the year 1590. It was brought to the attention\r\nof Gilbert and carefully tested by him in the course of his famous\r\npioneer experiments. Gilbert was led to predicate the existence of\r\nmagnetic poles, the exact location of which would be indicated by the\r\ndipping needle, which, sinking lower and lower as northern latitudes\r\nwere attained, would ultimately at the magnetic pole itself assume a\r\nvertical direction.\r\n\r\nThat this is a correct expression of the facts was determined in\r\nthe year 1831 by Sir James Ross, who in the course of his Arctic\r\nexplorations observed the vertical dip and so located the northern\r\nmagnetic pole at about 70 degrees 5 minutes north latitude and 96\r\ndegrees 43 minutes west longitude. It was thus proved that the magnetic\r\npole is situated a long distance--more than 1,200 miles--from the\r\ngeographical pole. The location of the south magnetic pole was most\r\naccurately determined in 1909 by Lieutenant Shackleton's expedition at\r\nabout 73 degrees south latitude and 156 degrees east longitude. The two\r\nmagnetic poles are thus not directly opposite each other on the earth's\r\nsurface, and the magnetic axis of the earth does not coincide with the\r\ngeographical center of the globe itself.\r\n\r\nFrom the standpoint of practical navigation the dip of the needle is\r\na matter of much less significance than its horizontal fluctuations.\r\nRobert Norman himself attempted to overcome the dip by a balancing\r\napparatus applied to the needle; and the modern compass is suspended\r\nin such a way that the propensity to dip does not interfere with\r\nthe lateral movements which supply the navigator with all important\r\ninformation. The modern compass in question is the invention of\r\nLord Kelvin and was patented by him in 1876. It consists of a\r\nnumber of small magnets arranged in parallel and held in position\r\nby silk threads, each suspended, cobweb-like, from the circular\r\nrim of aluminum. The weight--which in the aggregate is relatively\r\nslight--being thus largely at the circumference, the instrument has a\r\nmaximum period of oscillation and hence a high degree of stability. Its\r\nfluctuations due to the ship's influence are corrected by a carefully\r\nadjusted disposition of metal balls and magnets.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAILING BY DEAD RECKONING\r\n\r\nWhile the compass gives indispensable information as to direction,\r\nand is constantly under the eye of the pilot, it of course can give\r\nno direct information as to the distance traversed by the ship, and\r\nhence does not by itself suffice to tell the navigator his whereabouts.\r\nIn the early days there was indeed an expectation that the observed\r\ndeclination of the compass would reveal to the navigator his longitude\r\nand that the observation of the dip might enable him to determine his\r\nlatitude. But more extended observation shows that this was asking\r\naltogether too much of the compass, and while it may be useful as\r\nan accessory it is by no means the navigator's chief reliance in\r\ndetermining his location. This is accomplished, as everyone is aware,\r\nin clear weather by the observation of the heavenly bodies. In cloudy\r\nweather, however, such observations obviously cannot be made, and the\r\nseaman must direct his ship and estimate his location--an all important\r\nmatter when he is approaching the coast--by what is called dead\r\nreckoning. One element of this reckoning is furnished by the compass,\r\ninasmuch as that is his sole guide in determining the direction of\r\nthe ship's progress. The other element is supplied by the log which\r\nfurnishes him a clue as to the distance traversed hour by hour.\r\n\r\nIt is rather startling to reflect that the navigators of the middle\r\nages had no means whatever of determining the rate of progress of a\r\nship at sea, beyond the crudest guesses unaided by instrument of any\r\nkind. When Columbus made his voyage he had no means of knowing what\r\ndistance he had actually sailed; nor was any method of measuring the\r\nship's speed utilized throughout the course of the ensuing century. In\r\nthe year 1570, however, one Humfray Cole suggested a theoretical means\r\nof measuring the ship's rate of progress by means of an object dropped\r\nback of the ship and allowed to drag through the water; and this\r\nsuggestion led a generation later to the introduction of the log, which\r\nwas first actually tested, so far as can be learned, in the year 1607.\r\n\r\nThe original log was so called because it consisted essentially of\r\nan actual log or piece of wood. To the center of this a string was\r\nattached, and in testing the ship's rate of progress this string was\r\nallowed to slip through the fingers of a sailor who counted the number\r\nof knots--placed, of course, at regular intervals on the string--that\r\npassed through his fingers in a given time. As the log itself would\r\nremain practically stationary in the water where it was dropped, the\r\nnumber of knots counted indicated the distance traversed by the ship in\r\na given time. In practice the time was usually gauged by a half-minute\r\nsand glass, and the knots were arranged at such a distance on the cord\r\nthat, in the course of the half minute, one knot would pass through\r\nthe fingers for each nautical mile covered by the ship in an hour. The\r\nactual distance between the knots was therefore about fifty feet. The\r\nnautical or geographical mile represents one degree of the earth's\r\ncircumference at the equator, amounting therefore to 6,008 feet, as\r\nagainst the 5,280 feet of the statute mile. It was the use of the\r\nlog-line with its knots, as just explained, that led to the dubbing\r\nof the nautical mile by the name \"knot,\" which is still familiarly\r\nemployed, though the knotted log-line itself has been superseded in\r\nrecent times, except on very old-fashioned sailing ships.\r\n\r\nThe log retains its place even in the most modern ship, though its form\r\nis materially altered, and its importance is somewhat lessened owing to\r\nthe fact that the experienced skipper can test the speed of his ship\r\nvery accurately by noting the number of revolutions per minute of the\r\nship's propellers. It is indeed the ship's propeller that supplies\r\nthe model for the modern log, in which the primitive piece of wood is\r\nreplaced by a torpedo-like piece of metal with miniature propeller-like\r\nblades at its extremity. This apparatus is towed at the end of a long\r\nline, and its blades, whirling more or less rapidly according to the\r\nspeed of the ship, communicate their motion to a recording apparatus,\r\nadjusted at the ship's stern, to which the line is attached and the\r\nface of which ordinarily presents a dial on which the speed of the ship\r\nmay be observed as readily as one observes the time by the clock.\r\n\r\nSome recent modifications of the log employ an electrical device to\r\nregister the progress, but the principle of the revolving vanes, which\r\nowe their speed to the rate at which they are dragged through the\r\nwater, is the fundamental one upon which the action of the log usually\r\ndepends, though attempts have been made to substitute pressure-gauge\r\nsystems.\r\n\r\nWhile the modern log records the speed of the ship with a fair degree\r\nof accuracy, its register shows at best only an approximation of the\r\nfacts. As already mentioned, the rate of revolution of the ship's\r\npropeller blades furnishes what most navigators regard as a rather more\r\ndependable test of speed. An apparatus for recording this is found on\r\nthe bridge of the modern ship. But due allowance must of course be made\r\nfor the effect of winds, waves, and ocean currents. These constantly\r\nvariable factors obviously make the estimate as to the precise distance\r\ntraversed by a ship in a given time a matter not altogether devoid of\r\nguess work; and no navigator who has been obliged to sail for several\r\ndays by dead reckoning approaches a coast with quite the same degree\r\nof satisfaction that he may entertain if his log has been checked by\r\nobservation of the sun or stars. In case, however, a navigator is able\r\nto check his reckoning by astronomical observations, aided by the\r\nchronometer, he determines his location with great accuracy.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SEXTANT\r\n\r\nThe instrument with which such astronomical observations are made is\r\nknown as the sextant. Its purpose is to measure with great accuracy the\r\nangle between two objects, which in practice are the horizon line on\r\none hand and some celestial body, usually the sun, on the other. The\r\ndetermination of the latitude of the ship, for example, is a matter of\r\ncomparative ease, if the sun chances to be unobscured just at midday.\r\nThe navigator has merely to measure the exact elevation of the sun as\r\nit crosses the meridian,--that is to say when it is at its highest\r\npoint,--and, having made certain corrections for so-called dip and\r\nrefraction, to which we shall refer more at length in a moment, a very\r\nsimple calculation reveals the latitude--that is to say, the distance\r\nfrom the terrestrial equator.\r\n\r\nThat the latitude of a ship could thus be determined, with greater or\r\nless accuracy, has been familiar knowledge to seamen from a very early\r\nperiod. It was by the use of this principle that the earth was measured\r\nby Eratosthenes and Posidonius in classical times, and the sailors of\r\nantiquity probably carried with them a crude apparatus for measuring\r\nthe height of sun and stars, as the mediæval navigators are known to\r\nhave done.\r\n\r\nThe simplest and crudest form of measurer of which the record has been\r\npreserved is known as the cross-staff. This consisted essentially of a\r\nstick about a yard in length, called the staff, on which a cross-piece\r\nwas arranged at right angles, so adjusted at the center as to slide\r\nback and forth on the staff. An eye-piece at one end of the staff was\r\nutilized to sight along projections at either end of the cross-piece.\r\nIf the apparatus is held so that one of the lines of sight is directed\r\nto the horizon, and then the cross-piece slid along the staff until\r\nthe other line of sight is directed toward the sun or a given star,\r\nthe angle between the two lines of sight will obviously represent the\r\nangle of altitude of the celestial body in question. But the difficulty\r\nof using an apparatus which requires two successive observations to be\r\nmade without shift of position is obvious, and it is clear that the\r\ninformation derived from the cross-staff must have been at best very\r\nvague--by no means such as would satisfy the modern navigator.\r\n\r\nEven the navigators of the fifteenth century were aware of the\r\ndeficiencies of the cross-staff and sought to improve upon it. The\r\nphysicians of Henry the Navigator of Portugal, Roderick and Joseph by\r\nname, and another of his advisers, Martin de Bohemia, are credited\r\nwith inventing, or at least introducing, a much improved apparatus\r\nknown as the astrolabe. This consists of a circle of metal, arranged\r\nto be suspended from a ring at the side, so that one of its diameters\r\nwould maintain the horizontal position through the effect of gravity.\r\nA superior quadrant of the circle was marked with degrees and minutes.\r\nA straight piece of metal, with sights so that it could be accurately\r\npointed, was adjusted to revolve on a pivot at the center of the\r\ncircle. This sighting piece being aimed at the sun, for example, the\r\nelevation of that body could be read directly on the measuring arc\r\nof the circle. Here, then, was no new principle involved, but the\r\ninstrument had obvious points of advantage over the cross-staff, in\r\nparticular because only a single sight need be taken, the horizon\r\nline being determined, as already explained, through the action of\r\ngravitation.\r\n\r\nThe astrolabe did not gain immediate favor with practical navigators,\r\nand it was at best a rather clumsy instrument, subject to peculiar\r\ndifficulties when used on a rolling ship. Many attempts were made to\r\nimprove upon it, but for a long time none of these was altogether\r\nsuccessful. The final suggestion as to means of overcoming the\r\ndifficulties encountered in measuring the altitude of astronomical\r\nbodies was made by Sir Isaac Newton. But nothing practical came of\r\nhis discovery, as it was not published until a long time after his\r\ndeath. Meantime independent discovery of the same principle was\r\nmade by Thomas Godfrey of Philadelphia, in 1730, and by the English\r\nastronomer Hadley, who published his discovery before the Royal Society\r\nin 1731. The instrument which Hadley devised was called a quadrant.\r\nThe principle on which it worked involved nothing more complex than\r\nthe use of two mirrors, one of them (known as the horizon glass and\r\nhaving only half its surface mirrored) fixed in the line of vision of\r\na small telescope; the other (called the index mirror) movable with\r\nthe arm of an indicator, which is so adjusted as to revolve about the\r\naxis of the quadrant. In operation these two mirrors enable the images\r\nof two objects, the distance between which is to be measured, to be\r\nsuperimposed. The telescope may be pointed at the horizon, for example,\r\ndirectly under the position of the sun, and the arm of the instrument,\r\naltering the position of the so-called index mirror, may be rotated\r\nuntil the limb of the sun seems just to touch the horizon--the latter\r\nbeing viewed through the unsilvered half of the horizon glass. The\r\nscale at the circumference of the instrument is marked in half-degrees,\r\nwhich, however, are registered as whole degrees, and which, so\r\ninterpreted, give the direct measurement of the angular distance\r\nbetween the horizon and the sun; in other words the measurement of the\r\nsun's altitude or so-called declination.\r\n\r\nThe instrument just described, perfected as to details but not modified\r\nas to principles, constitutes the modern sextant, which is used by\r\nevery navigator, and which constitutes, along with the compass and\r\nchronometer, the practical instrumental equipment that enables the\r\nseaman to determine--by using the tables of the _Nautical Almanac_--his\r\nexact position on the earth's surface from observation of the sun or\r\ncertain of the fixed stars. The modern instrument is called a sextant\r\nbecause it has, for convenience' sake, been restricted in size to about\r\none-sixth of a circle instead of the original one-quarter, the small\r\nsize being found to answer every practical purpose, since it measures\r\nall angles up to 120 degrees.\r\n\r\nIn practice the sextant is an instrument only six or eight inches in\r\ndiameter. It is held in the right hand and the movable radial arm is\r\nadjusted with the left hand with the aid of a micrometer screw, and\r\nthe reading of the scale is made accurate by the vernier arrangement.\r\nThe ordinary observation--which every traveler has seen a navigator\r\nmake from the ship's bridge just at midday--is carried out by holding\r\nthe sextant in a vertical position directly in line of the sun, and\r\nsighting the visible horizon line, meantime adjusting the recording\r\napparatus so as to keep the sun's limb seemingly in touch with the\r\nhorizon. As the sun is constantly shifting its position the vernier\r\nmust be constantly adjusted until the observation shows that the sun is\r\nat the very highest point. The instrument being clamped and the scale\r\nread, the latitude may be known when proper correction has been made\r\nfor the so-called dip, for refraction, and where great accuracy is\r\nrequired for parallax.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"TAKING THE SUN\" WITH THE SEXTANT.\r\n\r\nThe instrument is held in the right hand, and levelled at the horizon;\r\nthe left hand manipulating the micrometer screw which adjusts the\r\nradial arm carrying the index mirror (at top of figure). The result is\r\nread on the Vernier scale (arc at bottom of figure) with the aid of the\r\nmagnifying glass.]\r\n\r\nDip, it may be explained, is due to the fact that the observation is\r\nmade not from the surface of the water but from an elevation, which\r\nis greater or less according to the height of the bridge, and which\r\ntherefore varies with each individual ship. The error of refraction\r\nis due to the refraction of the sun's light in passing through the\r\nearth's atmosphere, and will vary with the temperature and the degree\r\nof atmospheric humidity, both of which conditions must be taken into\r\naccount. The amount of refractive error is very great if an object\r\nlies near the horizon. Everyone is familiar with the oval appearance\r\nof the rising or setting sun, which is due to refraction. With the sun\r\nat the meridian, the refractive error is comparatively slight; and\r\nwhen a star is observed at the zenith the refractive error disappears\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\nBy parallax, as here employed, is meant the error due to the difference\r\nin the apparent position of the sun as viewed by an observer at any\r\npoint of the earth's surface from what the apparent position would\r\nbe if viewed from the line of the center of the earth, from which\r\ntheoretical point the observations are supposed to be made. In the case\r\nof bodies so distant as the sun, this angle is an exceedingly minute\r\none, and in the case of the fixed stars it disappears altogether. The\r\nsun's parallax is very material indeed from the standpoint of delicate\r\nastronomical observations, but it may be ignored altogether by the\r\npractical navigator in all ordinary observations. There is one other\r\ncorrection that he must make, however, in case of sun observations;\r\nhe must add, namely, the amount of semi-diameter of the sun to his\r\nobserved measurement, as all calculations recorded in the _Nautical\r\nAlmanac_ refer to the center of the sun's disk.\r\n\r\n\r\nPERFECTING THE CHRONOMETER\r\n\r\nThe observation of the sun's height, with the various corrections just\r\nsuggested, suffices by itself to define the latitude of the observer.\r\nSomething more is required, however, before he can know his longitude.\r\nHow to determine this, was a problem that long taxed the ingenuity of\r\nthe astronomer. The solution came finally through the invention of the\r\nchronometer, which is in effect an exceedingly accurate watch.\r\n\r\nTime measurers of various types have, of course, been employed from the\r\nearliest times. The ancient Oriental and Classical nations employed\r\nthe so-called clepsydra, which consisted essentially of receptacles\r\nfrom or into which water dripped through a small aperture, the lapse of\r\ntime being measured by the quantity of water. At an undetermined later\r\ndate sand was substituted for the water, and the hour glass with which,\r\nin some of its forms, nearly everyone is familiar, came into use. For\r\na long time this remained a most accurate of time measurers, though\r\nefforts were early made to find substitutes of greater convenience.\r\nThen clocks operated by weights and pulleys were introduced; and,\r\nfinally, after the time of the Dutchman Huygens, the pendulum clock\r\nfurnished a timepiece of great reliability. But the mechanism operated\r\nby weight or pendulum is obviously ill-adapted to use on shipboard.\r\nPortable watches, in which coiled springs took the place of the\r\npendulum, had indeed been introduced, but the mechanical ingenuity\r\nof the watchmaker could not suffice to produce very dependable\r\ntime-keepers. The very idea of a watch that would keep time accurately\r\nenough to be depended upon for astronomical observations intended to\r\ndetermine longitude was considered chimerical.\r\n\r\nNevertheless the desirability of producing a portable time-keeper\r\nof great accuracy was obvious, and the efforts of a large number\r\nof experimenters were directed towards this end in the course of\r\nthe eighteenth century. These efforts were stimulated by the hope\r\nof earning a prize of twenty thousand pounds offered by the British\r\nGovernment for a watch sufficiently accurate to determine the\r\nlocation of a ship with maximum error of half a degree, or thirty\r\nnautical miles, corresponding to two minutes of time, in the course\r\nof a transatlantic voyage. It affords a striking illustration of the\r\nrelative backwardness of nautical science, and of the difficulties\r\nto be overcome, to reflect that no means then available enabled the\r\nnavigator at the termination of a transatlantic voyage to be sure of\r\nhis location within the distance of thirty nautical miles by any means\r\nof astronomical or other observation known to the science of the time.\r\n\r\nThe problem was finally solved by an ingenious British carpenter\r\nnamed John Harrison, who devoted his life to the undertaking, and\r\nwho came finally to be the most successful of watchmakers. Harrison\r\nfirst achieved distinction by inventing the compensating pendulum--a\r\npendulum made of two metals having a different rate of expansion under\r\nthe influence of heat, so adjusted that change in one was compensated\r\nby a different rate of change in the other. Up to the time of this\r\ndiscovery, even the best of pendulum clocks had failed of an ideal\r\ndegree of accuracy owing to the liability to change of length of the\r\npendulum--and so, of course, to corresponding change in the rate of\r\nits oscillation--with every alteration of temperature. Another means\r\nof effecting the desired compensation was subsequently devised by Mr.\r\nGraham, through the use of a well of mercury in connection with the\r\npendulum, so arranged that the expansion of the mercury upward in its\r\ntube would compensate the lengthening of the pendulum itself under\r\neffect of heat, and vice versa; but the Harrison pendulum, variously\r\nmodified in design, remains in use as a highly satisfactory solution of\r\nthe problem.\r\n\r\nHarrison early conceived the idea that it might be possible to apply\r\nthe same principle to the balance-wheel of the watch. This problem\r\npresented very great practical difficulties, but by persistent effort\r\nthese were finally overcome, and a balance-wheel produced, which, owing\r\nto the unequal expansion and contraction of its two component metals\r\nunder changing temperature, altered its shape and so maintained its\r\nrate of oscillation almost--though never quite--regardless of changing\r\nconditions of temperature.\r\n\r\nIn 1761 Harrison produced a watch which was tested on a British ship\r\nin a trip to the West Indies in that and the succeeding year, and\r\nwhich proved to be a time-keeper of hitherto unexampled accuracy. The\r\ninventor had calculated that the watch, when carried into the tropics,\r\nwould vary its speed by one second per day with each average rise\r\nof ten degrees of temperature. Making allowance for this predicted\r\nalteration, it was found that the watch was far within the limits of\r\nvariation allowed by the conditions of the test above outlined. It had\r\nvaried indeed only five seconds during the journey across the ocean.\r\nOn the return trip the watch was kept in a place near the stern of\r\nthe ship, for the sake of dryness, where, however, it was subjected\r\nto a great deal of joggling, which led to a considerably greater\r\nirregularity of action; but even so its variation on reaching British\r\nshores was such as to cause a maximum miscalculation of considerably\r\nless than thirty nautical miles.\r\n\r\nAlthough Harrison seemed clearly enough to have won the prize,\r\nthere were influences at work that interfered for a time with full\r\nrecognition of his accomplishment. Presently he received half the\r\nsum, however, and ultimately, after having divulged the secret of his\r\ncompensating balance and proved that he could make other watches of\r\ncorresponding accuracy, he received the full award.\r\n\r\nMinor improvements have naturally been made in the watch since that\r\ntime, but the essential problem of making a really reliable portable\r\ntimepiece was solved by the compensating balance-wheel of Harrison.\r\nThe ship's chronometer of to-day is merely a large watch, with an\r\nescapement of particular construction, mounted on gimbals so that it\r\nwill maintain a practically horizontal position.\r\n\r\nModern ships are ordinarily provided with at least three of these\r\ntime-keepers in order that each may be compared with the others, and\r\na more accurate determination of the time made than would be possible\r\nfrom observation of a single instrument; inasmuch as no absolutely\r\naccurate time-keeper has ever been constructed. Two chronometers would\r\nobviously be not much better than one, since there would be no guide as\r\nto whether any variation between them had been caused by one running\r\ntoo fast or the other too slowly. But with a third chronometer to check\r\nthe comparison, it is equally obvious that a dependable clue will be\r\ngiven as to the exact time.\r\n\r\nIt is to be understood of course that the variation of any of the\r\nchronometers will be but slight if they are good instruments. Moreover\r\nthe tendency to vary in one direction or the other of each individual\r\ninstrument will be known from previous tests. Such tests are constantly\r\nmade at the Royal Observatory in England and elsewhere, and the\r\nbest chronometers bear certificates as to their accuracy and as to\r\ntheir rate of variation. It may be added that a chronometer or other\r\ntimepiece is technically said to be a perfect instrument, not when\r\nit has no variation at all--since this has proved an unattainable\r\nideal--but when its variation is slight, is always in one direction,\r\nand is perfectly or almost perfectly uniform.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDING THE TIME WITHOUT A CHRONOMETER\r\n\r\nIn the reference made above to the testing of Harrison's watch, it\r\nwas stated that that instrument varied by only a certain number of\r\nseconds in the course of the westerly voyage across the Atlantic, and\r\nthat its variation was somewhat greater on the return voyage. This\r\nimplies, clearly, that some method was available to test the watch in\r\nthe West Indies, without waiting for the return to England. At first\r\nthought this may cause no surprise, since the local time can of course\r\nbe known anywhere through meridian observations; but on reflection\r\nit may seem less and less obvious as to just what test was available\r\nthrough which the exact difference in time between Greenwich, at\r\nwhich the watch was originally tested, and local time at the station\r\nin the West Indies could be determined. There are, however, several\r\nastronomical observations through which this could be accomplished, and\r\nin point of fact the comparative times and hence the precise longitudes\r\nat many points on the Western Hemisphere--and indeed of all portions\r\nof the civilized globe--were accurately known before the day of the\r\nchronometer.\r\n\r\nOne of the simplest and most direct means of testing the time of a\r\nplace, as compared with Greenwich time, is furnished by observation\r\nof the occultation of one of the moons of Jupiter. By occultation is\r\nmeant, as is well known, the eclipse of the body through passing into\r\nthe shadow of its parent planet. This phenomenon, causing the sudden\r\nblotting out of the satellite as viewed from the earth, occurs at\r\ndefinite and calculable periods and is obviously quite independent\r\nof any terrestrial influence. It occurs at a given instant of time\r\nand would be observed at that instant by any mundane witness to whom\r\nJupiter was at that time visible. If then an observer noted the exact\r\nlocal time at which occultation occurred, and compared this observed\r\ntime with the Greenwich time at which such occultation was predicted\r\nto occur, as recorded in astronomical tables, a simple subtraction\r\nor addition will tell him the difference in time between his station\r\nand the meridian at Greenwich; and this difference of time can be\r\ntranslated into degrees of longitude by merely reckoning fifteen\r\ndegrees for each hour of time, and fractions of the hour in that\r\nproportion.\r\n\r\nIt will be noted that this observation has value for the purpose\r\nin question only in conjunction with certain tables in which the\r\nmovements of Jupiter and its satellite are calculated in advance. This\r\nis equally true of the various other observations through which the\r\nsame information may be obtained--as for example, the observation of a\r\ntransit of Mars, or the measurement of apparent distance between the\r\nmoon and a given fixed star. Before the tables giving such computations\r\nwere published it was quite impossible to determine the exact longitude\r\nof any transatlantic place whatsoever. We have already pointed out that\r\nColumbus had only a vague notion as to how far he had sailed when he\r\ndiscovered land in the West. The same vagueness obtained with all the\r\nexplorations of the immediately ensuing generations.\r\n\r\nIt was not until about the middle of the sixteenth century that\r\nMercator and his successors brought the art of map-making to\r\nperfection; and the celebrated astronomical tables of the German Mayer,\r\nwhich served as the foundation for calculations of great importance\r\nto the navigator, were not published until 1753. The first _Nautical\r\nAlmanac_, in which all manner of astronomical tables to guide the\r\nnavigator were included, was published at the British Royal Observatory\r\nin 1767.\r\n\r\nAt the present time, a navigator would be as likely to start on a\r\nvoyage without compass and sextant as without charts and a _Nautical\r\nAlmanac_. Indeed were he to overlook the latter the former would\r\nserve but a vague and inadequate purpose. Yet, as just indicated, this\r\ninvaluable adjunct to the equipment of the navigator was not available\r\nuntil well toward the close of the eighteenth century. But of course\r\nnumerous general tables had been in use long before this, else--to\r\nrevert to the matter directly in hand--it would not have been possible\r\nto make the above-recorded test in the case of Harrison's famous watch\r\nin the voyage of 1761-62.\r\n\r\n\r\nASCERTAINING THE SHIP'S LONGITUDE\r\n\r\nIn the days before the chronometer was perfected, almost numberless\r\nmethods of attempting to determine the longitude of a ship at sea were\r\nsuggested. There were astronomers who advocated observation of the\r\neclipse of Jupiter's satellites; others who championed the method of\r\nso-called lunars--that is to say, calculation based on observation of\r\nthe distance of the moon at a given local time from one or another of\r\ncertain fixed stars arbitrarily selected by the calculator. Inasmuch as\r\nthe seaman could always regulate even a faulty watch from day to day\r\nby observation of the meridian passage of the sun, it was thought that\r\nthese observations of Jupiter's satellite or of the moon would serve\r\nto determine Greenwich time and therefore the longitude at which the\r\nobservation was made with a fair degree of accuracy. But in practice\r\nit is not easy to observe the eclipse of Jupiter's satellite without a\r\nfair telescope; and it was soon found that the tables for calculating\r\nthe course of the moon were by no means reliable, hence theoretically\r\nexcellent methods of determining longitude by observation of that body\r\nproved quite unreliable in practice.\r\n\r\nIt was with the chief aim of bettering our knowledge of the moon's\r\ncourse through long series of very accurate observations that the Royal\r\nObservatory at Greenwich was founded. Perhaps it was not unnatural\r\nunder these circumstances that certain of the Astronomers Royal should\r\nhave advocated the method of lunars as the mainstay of the navigator.\r\nIn particular Maskelyne, who was in charge of the Observatory in\r\nthe latter part of the eighteenth century, was so convinced of\r\nthe rationality of this method that he was led to discredit the\r\nachievements of Harrison's watches, and for a long time to exert an\r\nantagonistic influence, which the watchmaker resented bitterly and it\r\nwould appear not without some show of reason.\r\n\r\nUltimately, however, the accuracy of the watch, and its\r\nindispensableness in the perfected form of the chronometer, having been\r\nfully demonstrated, the method of lunars became practically obsolete\r\nand the mariner was able to determine his longitude with the aid of\r\nsextant, chronometer, and _Nautical Almanac_, by means of direct\r\nobservation of the altitude of the sun by day and of sundry fixed stars\r\nby night, a much simpler calculation sufficing than was required by the\r\nolder method.\r\n\r\nAs the sun is the chief time-measurer, whose rate of passage in a\r\nseeming circumnavigation of the heavens is recorded by the dial of\r\nclock, watch, or chronometer, it would seem as if the simplest\r\npossible method of determining longitude would be found through\r\nobservation of the sun's meridian passage. The user of the sextant on\r\nshipboard always makes, if weather permits, a meridian observation\r\nof the sun, and such observation gives him an accurate gauge of the\r\naltitude of the sun at its highest point and hence of his own latitude.\r\nBy adjusting the arm of the sextant with which this observation is\r\nmade, the observer is able to determine the exact point reached by the\r\nsun in its upward course with all requisite accuracy.\r\n\r\nBut, unfortunately for his purpose, the sun does not poise for an\r\ninstant at the apex of its upward flight and then begin its descent. On\r\nthe contrary, its orbit being circular, the course of the sun just at\r\nits highest point is approximately horizontal for an appreciable length\r\nof time, and while the observer therefore has adequate opportunity to\r\nmeasure with accuracy the highest point reached, he cannot possibly\r\nmake sure, within the limits of a considerable fraction of a minute, as\r\nto the precise moment when the center of the sun is on the meridian. He\r\ncan, indeed, determine this point with sufficient accuracy for rough\r\ncalculations, but modern navigation demands something more than rough\r\ncalculations, inasmuch as a variation in time of one minute represents\r\none-quarter of a degree of longitude, or fifteen nautical miles at the\r\nequator, and such uncertainty as this would imply can by no means be\r\npermitted in the safe navigation of a ship that may be passing through\r\nthe water at the rate of a nautical mile in less than three minutes.\r\n\r\nIt follows that meridian observation of the sun, owing to the necessary\r\ninaccuracy of such observation, is not the ideal method. In point of\r\nfact the sun may be observed for this purpose to much better advantage\r\nwhen it is at a considerable distance from the meridian, since then\r\nits altitude above the horizon at a given moment is the only point\r\nnecessary to be determined. The calculation by which the altitude of\r\nthe sun may be translated into longitude is indeed more complicated\r\nin this case; but while spherical trigonometry is involved in the\r\ncalculation, the tables supplied by the _Nautical Almanac_ enable the\r\nnavigator to make the estimate without the use of any knowledge beyond\r\nthat of the simplest mathematics.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEASURING A DEGREE OF LATITUDE\r\n\r\nWhile these observations tell the navigator his exact location in\r\ndegrees of latitude and longitude, such knowledge does not of course\r\nreveal the distance traversed unless the precise length of the degree\r\nitself is known; and this obviously depends upon the size of the\r\nearth. Now we have seen that the earth was measured at a very early\r\ndate by Greek and Roman astronomers, but of course their measurements,\r\nremarkable though they were considering the conditions under which\r\nthey were made, were but rough approximations of the truth. Numerous\r\nattempts were made to improve upon these early measurements, but it\r\nwas not until well into the seventeenth century that a really accurate\r\nmeasurement was made between two points on the earth's surface, the\r\ndifference between which, as measured in degrees and minutes, was\r\naccurately known.\r\n\r\nIn June of the year 1633, the Englishman Robert Norman made very\r\naccurate observations of the altitude of the sun on the day of the\r\nsummer solstice (when of course it is at its highest point in the\r\nheavens); the observation being made with a quadrant several feet\r\nin diameter stationed at a point near the Tower of London. On the\r\ncorresponding day of the following year he made similar observations at\r\na point something like 125 miles south of London, in Surrey. The two\r\nobservations determined the exact difference in latitude between the\r\ntwo points in question.\r\n\r\nNorman then undertook a laborious survey, that he might accurately\r\nmeasure the precise distance in miles and fractions thereof that\r\ncorresponded to these known degrees of latitude. He made actual\r\nmeasurements with the chain for the most part, but in a few places\r\nwhere the topography offered peculiar difficulties he was obliged to\r\ndepend upon the primitive method of pacing.\r\n\r\nThe modern surveyor, equipped with instruments for the accurate\r\nmeasuring of angles, not differing largely in principle from the\r\nquadrant of the navigator, would consider Norman's method of\r\nmeasurement a very clumsy one. He would measure only a single original\r\nbase line of any convenient length, but would make that measurement\r\nwith very great accuracy, using, perhaps, a rod packed in ice that\r\nit might not vary in length by even the fraction of an inch through\r\nchanges in temperature. An accurate base line thus secured, he\r\nwould depend thereafter on the familiar method of triangulation, in\r\nwhich angles are measured very accurately, and from such measurement\r\nthe length of the sides of the successive triangles determined by\r\nsimple calculation. In the end he would thus have made the most\r\naccurate determination of the distance involved, without having\r\nactually measured any portion thereof except the original base line.\r\nNotwithstanding the crudity of Norman's method, however, his estimate\r\nof the actual length of a degree of the earth's surface was correct,\r\nas more recent measurements have demonstrated, within twelve yards--a\r\nreally remarkable result when it is recalled that the total length of\r\nthe degree is about sixty nautical miles.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as the earth is not precisely spherical, but is slightly\r\nflattened at the poles, successive degrees of latitude are not\r\nabsolutely uniform all along a meridian, but decrease slightly as the\r\npoles are approached. The deviation is so slight, however, that for\r\npractical purposes the degree of latitude may be considered as an\r\nunvarying unit. But obviously such is not the case with a degree of\r\nlongitude. The most casual glance at a globe on which the meridian\r\nlines are drawn, shows that these lines intersect at the poles, and\r\nthat the distance between them is, in the nature of the case, different\r\nat each successive point between poles and equator. It is only at the\r\nequator itself that a degree of longitude represents 1/360 of the\r\nearth's circumference. Everywhere else the parallels of latitude cut\r\nthe meridians in what are termed small circles--that is to say, circles\r\nthat do not represent circumference lines in the plane of the earth's\r\ncenter. Therefore while all points on any given meridian of longitude\r\nare equally distant in terms of degrees and minutes of arc from the\r\nmeridian of Greenwich, the actual distances from that meridian of the\r\ndifferent points as measured in miles will depend entirely upon their\r\nlatitude.\r\n\r\nAt the equator each degree of longitude corresponds to (approximately)\r\nsixty miles, but in the middle latitudes traversed for example by the\r\ntransatlantic lines, a degree of longitude represents only half that\r\ndistance; and in the far North the meridians of longitude draw closer\r\nand closer together until they finally converge, and at the poles all\r\nlongitudes are one.\r\n\r\nIt follows, then, that the navigator must always know both his latitude\r\nand his longitude in order to estimate the exact distance he has\r\nsailed. We have seen that a single instrument, the sextant, enables\r\nhim to make the observations from which both these essentials can be\r\ndetermined. We must now make further inquiry as to the all important\r\nguide without the aid of which his observations, however accurately\r\nmade, would avail him little. This guide, as already pointed out, is\r\nfound in the set of tables known as the _Nautical Almanac_.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NAUTICAL ALMANAC\r\n\r\nHad the earth chanced to be poised in space with its axis exactly at\r\nright angles to its plane of revolution, many computations of the\r\nastronomer would be greatly simplified. Again, were the planetary\r\ncourse circular instead of elliptical, and were the earth subject to\r\nno gravitational influences except that of the sun and moon, matters\r\nof astronomical computation would be quite different from what they\r\nare. But as the case stands, the axis of the earth is not only tipped\r\nat an angle of about twenty-three degrees, but is subject to sundry\r\nvariations, due to the wobbling of the great top as it whirls.\r\n\r\nThen the other planets, notably the massive Jupiter, exert a perverting\r\ninfluence which constantly interferes with the regular progression of\r\nthe earth in its annual tour about the sun. A moment's reflection makes\r\nit clear that the gravitation pull of Jupiter is exerted sometimes in\r\nopposition to that of the sun, whereas at other times it is applied in\r\naid of the sun, and yet again at various angles. In short, on no two\r\nsuccessive days--for that matter no two successive hours or minutes--is\r\nthe perturbing influence of Jupiter precisely the same.\r\n\r\nWhat applies to the earth applies also, of course, to the varying\r\naction of Jupiter on the moon and to the incessantly varied action of\r\nthe moon itself upon the earth. All in all, then, the course of our\r\nglobe is by no means a stable and uniform one; though it should be\r\nunderstood that the perturbations are at most very slight indeed as\r\ncompared with the major motions that constitute its regular action and\r\nlead to the chief phenomena of day and night and the succession of the\r\nseasons.\r\n\r\nRelatively slight though the perturbations may be, however, they are\r\nsufficient to make noteworthy changes in the apparent position of the\r\nsun and moon as viewed with modern astronomical instruments; and they\r\ncan by no means be ignored by the navigator who will determine the\r\nposition of his ship within safe limits of error. And so it has been\r\nthe work of the practical astronomers to record thousands on thousands\r\nof observations, giving with precise accuracy the location of sun,\r\nmoon, planets, and various stars at given times; and these observations\r\nhave furnished the basis for the elaborate calculations of the\r\nmathematical astronomers upon which the tables are based that in their\r\nfinal form make up the _Nautical Almanac_, to which we have already\r\nmore than once referred.\r\n\r\nThese calculations take into account the precise nature of the\r\nperturbing influences that are exerted on the earth and on the moon\r\non any given day, and hence lead to the accurate prediction as to the\r\nexact relative positions of these bodies on that day. Stated otherwise,\r\nthey show the precise position in the heavens which will be held at\r\nany given time by the sun for example, or by the important planets,\r\nas viewed from the earth. How elaborate these computations are may be\r\ninferred from the statement that the late Professor Simon Newcomb used\r\nabout fifty thousand separate and distinct observations in preparing\r\nhis tables of the sun. Once calculated, however, these tables of\r\nProfessor Newcomb are so comprehensive as to supply data from which the\r\nexact position of the sun can be found for any day between the years\r\n1200 B.C. and 2300 A.D., a stretch of some thirty-five centuries.\r\n\r\nSuch a statement makes it clear how very crude and vague the\r\ndeductions must have been from the observations of navigators, however\r\naccurately made, prior to the time when such tables as those of the\r\n_Nautical Almanac_ had been prepared. Fully to appreciate this, it\r\nis necessary to understand that the observations supplied in such\r\nprofusion for the use of the mathematical astronomer are in themselves\r\nsubject to errors that might seriously vitiate the results of the final\r\ncomputation. They must, therefore, be made with the utmost accuracy,\r\nand with instruments specially prepared for the purpose. The chief\r\nof these instruments is not the gigantic telescope but the small\r\nand relatively simple apparatus known as a transit instrument. This\r\nconstitutes essentially a small telescope poised on very carefully\r\nadjusted trunnions, in such a way that it revolves in a vertical\r\naxis, bringing into view any celestial body that is exactly on the\r\nmeridian, and bodies in this position only. To make observation of\r\nthe transit--that is to say the passage across the meridian line--of\r\nany given body more accurate, the transit instrument has stretched\r\nvertically across the center of its field of vision a spider web, or a\r\nseries of parallel spider webs; in order, in the latter case, that the\r\nmean time of several observations may be taken.\r\n\r\nSo exceedingly difficult is it to manufacture and mount an instrument\r\nof requisite nicety of adjustment, that the effort has almost baffled\r\nthe ingenuity of the mechanic. Sir George Airy, in making a transit\r\ninstrument for use at the Royal Observatory at Greenwich, required the\r\ntrunnions on which it was to be mounted to be ground truly cylindrical\r\nin form within a variation of one thirty-two-thousandth of an inch\r\nas determined by a delicate spirit level. Even when all but absolute\r\ndecision has been obtained, however, it is quite impossible to maintain\r\nit, as the slightest variation of temperature--due perhaps to the\r\napplication of the hand to one of the pillars on which the trunnions\r\nrest--may disturb the precise direction of the spider webs and so\r\nmilitate against absolute accuracy of observation. The instrument must,\r\ntherefore, be constantly tested and its exact range of errors noted and\r\nallowed for.\r\n\r\nTo devote so much labor to details, merely in the effort to determine\r\nthe precise moment at which a star or planet crosses the meridian,\r\nwould seem to be an absurd magnification of trifles. But when we\r\nreflect that the prime object of such observations is to supply\r\npractical data which will be of service in enabling navigators on all\r\nthe seas of the globe to bring their ships safely to port, the matter\r\ntakes on quite another aspect. We have here, obviously, another and\r\na very striking illustration of the close relationship that obtains\r\nbetween the work of the theoretical devotee of science and that of the\r\npractical man of affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOUNDINGS AND CHARTS\r\n\r\nThough the navigator, thanks to his compass, sextant, and _Nautical\r\nAlmanac_, may determine with a high degree of precision his exact\r\nlocation, yet even the best observations do not enable him to approach\r\na coast without safeguarding his ship by the use of another piece of\r\nmechanism calculated to test the depth of the waters in which he finds\r\nhimself at any given moment. In its most primitive form--in which form,\r\nby the bye, it is still almost universally employed--this apparatus is\r\ncalled the lead,--so called with much propriety because it consists\r\nessentially of a lump of lead or other heavy weight attached to a small\r\nrope. Knots in the rope enable the sailor who manipulates the lead to\r\nnote at a glance the depth to which it sinks. Most ocean travelers have\r\nseen a sailor heaving the lead repeatedly at the side of the ship and\r\nnoting the depth of the water, particularly as the ship approached the\r\nLong Island shore.\r\n\r\nWhile this simple form of lead suffices for ordinary purposes, when\r\nthe chief information sought is as to whether the water is deeper than\r\nthe draft of the ship, it is at best only a rough and ready means of\r\ntesting the depth in relatively shallow waters. For deeper waters and\r\nto test with greater accuracy the depths of uncharted regions, and in\r\nparticular to determine the character of the sea bottom at any given\r\nplace, more elaborate apparatuses are employed. One of the most useful\r\nof these is the invention of the late Lord Kelvin. In this the lead\r\nis replaced by a cannon ball, perforated and containing a cylinder\r\nwhich is detached when the weight reaches the bottom and is drawn to\r\nthe surface filled with sand or mud, the cannon ball remaining at the\r\nbottom. In another form of patent lead, a float becomes detached so\r\nsoon as the weight strikes the bottom and comes at once to the surface,\r\nthus recording the fact that the bottom has been reached,--a fact not\r\nalways easy to appreciate by the mere feel of the line when the water\r\nis fairly deep.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that however well informed the navigator may be as to\r\nhis precise latitude and longitude, he can feel no safety unless he\r\nis equally well informed as to the depth of the water, the proximity\r\nof land, the presence or absence of shallows in the region, and the\r\nlike. He must, therefore, as a matter of course, be provided with maps\r\nand charts on which these things are recorded. From the days when\r\nnavigation first became a science, unceasing efforts have been made\r\nto provide such maps and charts for every known portion of the globe.\r\nGeographical surveys, with the aid of the method of triangulation, have\r\nbeen made along all coasts, and elaborate series of soundings taken for\r\na long distance from the coast line, and there are now few regions into\r\nwhich a ship ordinarily sails, or is likely to be carried by accident,\r\nfor which elaborate charts, both of coast lines and of soundings, have\r\nnot been provided. The experienced navigator is able to direct his ship\r\nwith safety along coasts that he visits for the first time, or to enter\r\nany important harbor on the globe without requiring the services of a\r\nlocal pilot,--albeit the desire to take no undue risk makes it usual to\r\naccept such services.\r\n\r\nTime was, however, when maps and charts were not to be had, and when\r\nin consequence the navigator who started on his voyages of exploration\r\nwas undertaking a feat never free from hazard. Until the time of\r\nMercator there was not even uniformity of method among map makers in\r\nthe charting of regions that had been explored. The thing seems simple\r\nenough now, thanks to the maps with which every one has been familiar\r\nsince childhood. But it required no small exercise of ingenuity to\r\ndevise a reasonably satisfactory method of representing on a flat\r\nsurface regions that in reality are distributed over the surface of a\r\nglobe. The method devised by Mercator, and which, as everyone knows, is\r\nnow universally adopted, consists in drawing the meridians as parallel\r\nlines, giving therefore a most distorted presentation of the globe, in\r\nwhich the distance between the meridians at the poles--where in reality\r\nthere is no distance at all--is precisely as great as at the equator.\r\nTo make amends for this distortion, the parallels of latitude are not\r\ndrawn equidistant, as in reality they practically are on the globe, but\r\nare spaced farther and farther apart, as we advance from the equator\r\ntoward either pole. The net result is that an island in the arctic\r\nregion would be represented on the map several times as large as an\r\nisland actually the same size but located near the equator. Doubtless\r\nmost of us habitually conceive Alaska and Greenland to be vastly more\r\nextensive regions than they really are, because of our familiarity with\r\nmaps showing this so-called \"Mercator's projection.\"\r\n\r\nOf course maps are also made that hold to the true proportions,\r\nrepresenting the lines of latitude as equidistant and the meridians of\r\nlongitude as lines converging to a point at the poles. But while such\r\na map as this has certain advantages--giving, for example, a correct\r\nnotion of the relative sizes of polar and other land masses--it is\r\notherwise confusing inasmuch as places that really lie directly in\r\nthe north and south line cannot be so represented except just at the\r\nmiddle of the map, and it is very difficult for the ordinary user of\r\nthe map to gain a clear notion as to the actual points of the compass.\r\nA satisfactory compromise may be effected, however, by using Mercator's\r\nprojection for maps showing wide areas, while the other method is\r\nemployed for local maps.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LURE OF THE UNKNOWN\r\n\r\nWhile the average man, even with well developed traveling instincts,\r\nwould perhaps prefer always to feel that he is sailing in well charted\r\nwaters and along carefully surveyed coasts, there have been in every\r\ngeneration men who delighted in taking risks, and for whom half the\r\ncharm of a voyage must always lie in its dangers. Such men have been\r\nthe pioneers in exploring the new regions of the globe. That there was\r\nno dearth of such restless spirits in classical times and even in the\r\ndark ages, records that have come down to us sufficiently attest. For\r\nthe most part, however, their names have not been preserved to us. But\r\nsince the ushering in of the period which we to-day think of as the\r\nbeginning of modern times, records have been kept of all important\r\nvoyages of discovery, and at least the main outlines of the story of\r\nthe conquest of the zones are familiar to everyone.\r\n\r\nSome of the earliest explorers, most notable among whom was the\r\nItalian Marco Polo, traveled eastward from the Mediterranean and\r\nhence journeyed largely by land. But soon afterward, thanks to\r\nthe introduction of the compass,--which instrument Marco Polo has\r\nsometimes been mistakenly accredited with bringing from the East,--the\r\nadventurers began to cast longing eyes out toward the western\r\nhorizons. Among the first conspicuous and inspiriting results were the\r\ndiscoveries of the groups of islands known as the Cape Verdes and the\r\nAzores. The Canary Islands were visited by Spaniards even earlier, and\r\nbecame the subject of controversy with the other chief maritime nation\r\nof the period, the Portuguese.\r\n\r\nWhen the controversy was adjusted the Spaniards were left in possession\r\nof the Canaries, but the Portuguese were given by treaty the exclusive\r\nright to explore the coast of Africa. Following up sundry tentative\r\nefforts, the daring Portuguese navigator, Bartholomeo Dias, in the\r\nyear 1487, passed to the southern-most extremity of Africa, which he\r\nchristened the Cape of Good Hope. At last, then, it had been shown\r\nthat Africa did not offer an interminable barrier to the passage to\r\nthe fabled land of treasures in the East. Before anyone had ventured\r\nto follow out the clues which the discovery of the Cape had presented,\r\nhowever, Columbus had seemingly solved the problem in another way by\r\nsailing out boldly into the West and supposedly coming to the East\r\nIndies in 1492.\r\n\r\nThe western route was barred to the Portuguese but the eastern one\r\nremained open to them, and before the close of the century Vasco da\r\nGama had set out on the voyage that ultimately led him to India by way\r\nof the Cape (1497-1500 A.D.). Twenty years later another Portuguese\r\nnavigator, Magellan by name, started on what must ever remain the most\r\nmemorable of voyages, save only that of Columbus. Magellan rounded the\r\nsouthern point of South America and in 1521 reached the Philippines,\r\nwhere he died. His companions continued the voyage and accomplished\r\nultimately the circumnavigation of the globe; and in so doing afforded\r\nthe first unequivocal practical demonstration, of a character\r\ncalculated to appeal to the generality of uncultured men of the time,\r\nthat the world is actually round.\r\n\r\nTwo routes from Europe to the Indies had thus been established, but\r\nboth of them were open to the objection that they necessitated long\r\ndetours to the South. To the geographers of the time it seemed more\r\nthan probable that a shorter route could be established by sailing\r\nnorthward and coasting along the shores either of Europe to the East\r\nor--what seemed more probable--of America to the West. Toward the\r\nclose of the sixteenth century the ships of the Dutch navigators had\r\npenetrated to Nova Zembla, and a few years later Henry Hudson visited\r\nSpitzbergen, thus inaugurating the long series of arctic expeditions.\r\nThen Hudson, still sailing under the Dutch flag, made heroic efforts to\r\nfind the fabled northwest passage, only to meet his doom in the region\r\nof the Bay that has since borne his name.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE QUEST OF THE POLE\r\n\r\nThis was in the year 1610. For long generations thereafter successors\r\nof Hudson were to keep up the futile quest; and when finally it\r\nhad been clearly established that no northwest passage to the\r\nPacific could be made available, owing to the climate, the zest for\r\narctic exploration did not abate, but its goal was changed from the\r\nhypothetical northwest passage to the geographical pole.\r\n\r\nHenry Hudson had in his day established a farthest North record of\r\nabout the eighty-second parallel of latitude--leaving only about five\r\nhundred miles to be traversed. But three centuries were required in\r\nwhich to compass this relatively small gap. Expedition after expedition\r\npenetrated as far as human endurance under given conditions could carry\r\nit. Some of the explorers returned with vivid tales of the rigors of\r\nthe arctic climate; others fell victim to conditions that they could\r\nnot overcome. But the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries\r\npassed and left the \"Boreal Center\" undiscovered.\r\n\r\nToward the close of the nineteenth century the efforts of explorers\r\nseemed to be redoubled and one famous expedition after another\r\nestablished new records of \"farthest North.\" The names of Nansen, the\r\nDuke of the Abruzzi, and Peary, became familiar to a generation whose\r\nimagination seemed curiously in sympathy with that lure of the North\r\nwhich determined the life activities of so many would-be discoverers.\r\nSo when in the early Autumn of 1909 it was suddenly announced that two\r\nexplorers in succession had at last, in the picturesque phrasing of one\r\nof them, \"penetrated the Boreal Center and plucked the polar prize,\"\r\nthe popular mind was stirred as it has seldom been by any other event\r\nnot having either a directly personal or an international political\r\nsignificance.\r\n\r\nThe two men whose claims to have discovered the pole were thus\r\nannounced in such spectacular fashion, were Dr. Frederick A. Cook,\r\nof Brooklyn, and Lieutenant Commander Robert E. Peary, of the United\r\nStates Navy. Dr. Cook claimed to have reached the pole, accompanied\r\nonly by two Eskimo companions, on the twenty-first day of April, 1908.\r\nCommander Peary reported that he had reached the pole, accompanied by\r\nMr. Matthew H. Henson and four Eskimos, on the seventh day of April,\r\n1909.\r\n\r\nThe controversy that ensued regarding the authenticity of these\r\nalleged discoveries is not likely to be forgotten by any reader of our\r\ngeneration. Its merits and demerits have no particular concern for the\r\npurely scientific inquirer. At best, as Professor Pickering of Harvard\r\nis reported to have said, \"the quest of the pole is a good sporting\r\nevent\" rather than an enterprise of great scientific significance. It\r\nsuffices for our present purpose, therefore, to know that Dr. Cook's\r\nrecords, as adjudged by the tribunal of the University of Copenhagen,\r\nto which they were sent, were pronounced inadequate to demonstrate the\r\nvalidity of his claim; whereas Peary and Henson were adjudged by the\r\nAmerican Geographical Society, after inspection of the records, to have\r\naccomplished what was claimed for them. What has greater interest from\r\nthe present standpoint is the question, which the controversy brought\r\nactively to the minds of the unscientific public, as to how tests are\r\nmade which determine, in the mind of the explorer himself, the fact of\r\nhis arrival at the pole.\r\n\r\nThe question has, indeed, been largely answered in the earlier pages\r\nof this chapter, in our discussion of the sextant and the _Nautical\r\nAlmanac_; for these constitute the essential equipment of the arctic\r\nexplorer no less than of the navigators of the seas of more accessible\r\nlatitudes. There is one important matter of detail, however, that\r\nremains to be noted. This relates to the manner of using the sextant.\r\nOn the ocean, as we have seen, the navigator levels the instrument at\r\nthe visible horizon; but it is obvious that on land or on the irregular\r\nice fields of the arctic seas no visible horizon can be depended upon\r\nas a basis for measuring the altitude of sun or stars. So an artificial\r\nhorizon must be supplied.\r\n\r\nThe problem is solved by the use of a reflecting surface, which may\r\nconsist of an ordinary mirror or a dish of mercury. The glass reflector\r\nmust be adjusted in the horizontal plane with the aid of spirit levels;\r\nmercury, on the other hand, being liquid, presents a horizontal surface\r\nunder the action of gravitation. Unfortunately mercury freezes at\r\nabout 39 degrees below zero; it is therefore often necessary for the\r\narctic explorer to melt it with a spirit lamp before he can make use\r\nof it. These, however, are details aside from which the principles of\r\nuse of glass and mercury horizon are identical. The method consists\r\nsimply in viewing the reflected image of the celestial body--which in\r\npractice in the arctic regions is usually the sun--and so adjusting the\r\nsextant that the direct image coincides with the reflected one. The\r\nangle thus measured will represent twice the angular elevation of the\r\nbody in question above the horizon,--this being, as we have seen, the\r\ninformation which the user of the sextant desires.\r\n\r\nOf course the explorer makes his \"dash for the pole\" in a season when\r\nthe sun is perpetually above the horizon. As he approaches the pole the\r\ncourse of the sun becomes apparently more and more nearly circular,\r\ndeparting less and less from the same altitude. Hence it becomes\r\nincreasingly difficult to determine by observation the exact time when\r\nthe sun is at its highest point. But it becomes less and less important\r\nto do so as the actual proximity of the pole is approached; and as\r\nviewed from the pole itself the sun, circling a practically uniform\r\ncourse, varies its height in the course of twenty-four hours only\r\nby the trifling amount which represents its climb toward the summer\r\nsolstice. Such being the case, an altitude observation of the sun may\r\nbe made by an observer at the pole at any hour of the day with equal\r\nfacility, and it is only necessary for him to know from his chronometer\r\nthe day of the month in order that he may determine from the _Nautical\r\nAlmanac_ whether the observation really places him at ninety degrees of\r\nlatitude. Nor indeed is it necessary that he should know the exact day\r\nprovided he can make a series of observations at intervals of an hour\r\nor two. For if these successive observations reveal the sun at the same\r\naltitude, it requires no _Almanac_ and absolutely no calculation of any\r\nkind to tell him that his location is that of the pole.\r\n\r\nThe observation might indeed be made with a fair degree of accuracy\r\nwithout the use of the sextant or of any astronomical equivalent\r\nmore elaborate than, let us say, an ordinary lead pencil. It is only\r\nnecessary to push the point of the pencil into a level surface of ice\r\nor snow and leave it standing there in a vertical position. If, then,\r\nthe shadow cast by the pencil is noted from time to time, it will be\r\nobserved that its length is always the same; that, in other words,\r\nthe end of the shadow as it moves slowly about with the sun describes\r\na circle in the course of twenty-four hours. If the atmospheric\r\nconditions had remained uniform, so that there was no variation in the\r\namount of refraction to which the sun's rays were subjected, the circle\r\nthus described would be almost perfect, and would in itself afford a\r\ndemonstration that would appeal to the least scientific of observers.\r\n\r\nAn even more simple demonstration might be made by having an Eskimo\r\nstand in a particular spot and marking the length of his shadow as cast\r\non a level stretch of ice or snow. Just twelve hours later let the\r\nEskimo stand at the point where a mark had been made to indicate the\r\nend of the shadow, and it would be found that his present shadow--cast\r\nnow, of course, in the opposite direction--would reach exactly to the\r\npoint where he had previously stood. The only difficulty about this\r\nsimple experiment would result from the fact that the sun is never\r\nvery high as viewed from the pole and therefore the shadow would\r\nnecessarily be long. It might therefore be difficult to find a level\r\narea of sufficient extent on the rough polar sea. In that case another\r\nmeasurement similar in principle could be made by placing a pole\r\nupright in the snow or ice and marking on the pole the point indicated\r\nby the shadow of an Eskimo standing at any convenient distance away.\r\nAt any interval thereafter, say six or twelve hours, repeat the\r\nexperiment, letting the man stand at the same distance from the pole as\r\nbefore, and his shadow will be seen to reach to the same mark.\r\n\r\nVarious other simple experiments of similar character may be devised,\r\nany of which would appeal to the most untutored intelligence as\r\nexhibiting phenomena of an unusual character. Absolutely simple as\r\nthese experiments are, they are also, within the limits of their\r\naccuracy, absolutely demonstrative. There are only two places on the\r\nglobe where the shadow of the upright pencil would describe a circle,\r\nor where the man's shadow would be of the same length at intervals of\r\ntwelve hours, or would reach to the same height on a pole in successive\r\nhours. These two regions are of course the poles of the earth. It may\r\nreasonably be expected that explorers who reach the poles will make\r\nsome such experiments as these for the satisfaction of their untrained\r\nassociates, to whom the records of the sextant would be enigmatical.\r\nBut for that matter even an Eskimo could make for himself a measurement\r\nby using only a bit of a stick held at arm's length--as an artist\r\nmeasures the length of an object with his pencil--that would enable\r\nhim to make reasonably sure that the sun was at the same elevation\r\nthroughout the day--subject, however, to the qualification that the\r\npolar ice was sufficiently level to provide a reasonably uniform\r\nhorizon.\r\n\r\nWhile, therefore, it appears that the one place of all others at which\r\nit would be exceedingly easy to determine one's position from the\r\nobservation of the sun is the region of the pole, it must be borne in\r\nmind that the low elevation of the sun, and the extreme cold may make\r\naccurate instrumental observations difficult; and it is conceivable\r\nthat the explorer who had the misfortune to encounter cloudy weather,\r\nand who therefore gained only a brief view of the sun, might be left\r\nin doubt as to whether he had really reached the goal of his ambition.\r\nFortunately, however, the explorers who thus far claim to have reached\r\nthe pole record uninterruptedly fair weather, enabling observations to\r\nbe taken hour after hour. Under these circumstances, there could be no\r\npossibility of mistake as to the general location, although perhaps no\r\nobservation, under the existing conditions, could make sure of locating\r\nthe precise position of the pole within a few miles.\r\n\r\nA curious anomaly incident to the unique geographical location of\r\nthe pole is that to the observer stationed there all directions are\r\ndirectly south. Yet of course all directions are not one, and the query\r\nmay arise as to how an explorer who has reached the pole may know in\r\nwhat direction to start on his return voyage. The answer is supplied\r\nby the compass, which--perforce pointing straight south--indicates the\r\nposition of the magnetic pole and so makes clear in which direction\r\nlies the coast of Labrador. Moreover if the explorer is provided with\r\nreliable chronometers, which of course record the time at a given\r\nmeridian--say that of Greenwich--these will enable him to determine by\r\nthe simplest calculation what particular region lies directly beneath\r\nthe sun at any given time. If, for example, his chronometer shows five\r\no'clock Greenwich time, he knows that the sun's position, as observed\r\nat the moment, marks the meridian five hours (_i.e._, 75° of longitude)\r\nwest of Greenwich.\r\n\r\nWhile the arctic region appears thus to have given up its last secret,\r\nthis is not as yet true of the antarctic. The expedition of Lieutenant\r\n(now Sir Ernest) Shackleton, in 1908, approached within about one\r\nhundred and eleven miles of the South Pole. The intervening space--less\r\nthan two degrees in extent--represents, therefore, the only stretch of\r\nlatitude on the earth's surface that has not been trodden by man's foot\r\nor crossed by his ships. More than one expedition is being planned to\r\nexplore this last remaining stronghold, and in all probability not many\r\nyears--perhaps not many months--will elapse before the little stretch\r\nof ice that separated Lieutenant Shackleton from the South Pole will be\r\ncrossed, and man's conquest of the zones will be complete.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nTHE HIGHWAY OF THE WATERS\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that the use of sails for propelling boats is as old\r\nas civilization itself. We know that the Egyptians used sails at least\r\n4,000 years before the Christian era. They did not depend entirely upon\r\nthe sails, however, but used oars in combination with them. Steering\r\nwas done with single or double oars lashed to the stern and controlled\r\nby ropes or levers. This method of steering remained in use until late\r\nin the Middle Ages, the invention of the rudder being one of the few\r\nnautical inventions made during the centuries immediately following\r\nthat unproductive period of history known as the Dark Age.\r\n\r\nFollowing the Egyptians, the Phœnicians were the greatest maritime\r\nnation of ancient times, but unfortunately they have left no very\r\nsatisfactory and authentic records describing their boats. In all\r\nprobability, however, their ships were galleys having one or two banks\r\nof oars, fitted with sails similar to those of the Egyptians.\r\n\r\nIf our knowledge of Phœnician boats is meager, our knowledge of Greek\r\nboats, particularly the fighting craft, is correspondingly full. From\r\nthe nature of its geographical location Greece was necessarily a\r\nmaritime nation, and it was here that boat-building reached a very\r\nhigh state of development during the period of Greek predominance.\r\nLarge ships fitted with sails and having several banks of rowers were\r\nused habitually in commerce and war, and it was here also that the\r\nmanagement of sails became so well understood that oars were often\r\ndispensed with except as auxiliaries.\r\n\r\nIt was in Greece that the custom of having several banks of oars\r\nsuperimposed reached its highest development, but the fabulous number\r\nof such banks credited by some authors seems to be entirely without\r\nfoundation. It is possible that as many as seven banks were used,\r\nalthough the evidence in favor of more than five is very slight.\r\n\r\nThe writings of Callixenos describe a ship said to have been used by\r\nPtolemy Philopater, which was a forty-banker. This ship is described as\r\n450 feet long, 57 feet broad, carrying a crew of about 7,000 men, of\r\nwhom 4,000 were rowers. This description need not be taken seriously,\r\nas there is no proof that boats of such proportions were ever attempted\r\nin ancient times. But it is certain that the Greeks did build large\r\nvessels, some of them at least one hundred and fifty feet long--perhaps\r\neven larger than this. The tendency of shipbuilders during the later\r\nGreek period was to build large, unwieldy boats, which used sails\r\nunder favorable circumstances, but depended entirely upon oars for\r\nmanœuvering in battle.\r\n\r\nThe Romans used similar vessels of large size until the time of the\r\nbattle of Actium, where the clumsy, many-banked ships of Antony and\r\nCleopatra were destroyed by the lighter single- or double-banked\r\nvessels of Augustus. Augustus had adopted the low, swift, handy vessels\r\nof a piratical people, the Liburni, who had learned in their sea fights\r\nagainst all kinds of vessels that the lighter type of boat could be\r\nused most effectively. Structurally the hulls of these boats were not\r\nunlike modern wooden vessels.\r\n\r\nWhile the various types of vessels were being developed in the\r\nMediterranean region, a race of mariners far to the north were\r\nperfecting boats in which they were destined to overrun the Western\r\nseas from the tropics to the arctic circle. These people, the Norsemen,\r\nleft few written descriptions that give a good idea of the construction\r\nof their boats, which were sufficiently seaworthy to enable the Danes\r\nto cross the Atlantic and colonize America. But thanks to one of their\r\npeculiar burial customs some of their smaller boats have been preserved\r\nand brought to light in recent years. It was their custom when a great\r\nchief died, to bury him in a ship, heaping earth over it to form a\r\ngreat mound. In most instances the wood of such boats, buried for a\r\nthousand years, has entirely disappeared; but in some mounds the boats\r\nhave been preserved almost intact.\r\n\r\nFrom the specimens so preserved it is known that the Norsemen knew\r\nhow to shape the hulls of their boats almost as well as the modern\r\nboat-builder. This fact is interesting because the immediate successors\r\nof the Norsemen, either through ignorance or choice, reverted to most\r\nprimitive types in building their boats. Thus it required centuries for\r\nthem to develop a knowledge of hull-construction that was familiar in\r\nancient times to the northern rovers. Scandinavia itself never entirely\r\nforgot the art, and there are boats built in Norway to-day closely\r\nsimilar in all essentials to some of the boats constructed by the\r\nNorsemen.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEDIÆVAL SHIPS\r\n\r\nThe contrast in shape and construction between the trim ships of the\r\nNorsemen and the short, top-heavy vessels which were the approved\r\nEuropean type during the early Middle Ages, is most striking. The\r\nMediæval shipbuilders in striving to improve their craft, making them\r\nas seaworthy and as spacious as possible, first added decks, and then\r\nbuilt towering superstructures at bow and stern. The result was a\r\nvessel which would have been so top-heavy that it would be likely to\r\ncapsize had it not been so broad that \"turning turtle\" was out of the\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nIt was in such ships that Columbus made his voyage of discovery in\r\n1492, although the superstructures fore and aft on his boat were\r\nless exaggerated than in some later vessels. Nevertheless they were\r\nveritable \"tubs\"; and we know from the experience of the crew that\r\nsailed the replica of the _Santa Maria_ across the ocean in 1893, that\r\nthey were anything but comfortable craft for ocean traveling.\r\n\r\nThis replica of the _Santa Maria_ was reproduced with great fidelity\r\nby the Spanish shipbuilders, and, manned by a Spanish crew, crossed\r\nthe ocean on a course exactly following that taken by Columbus on his\r\nfirst voyage. Sir George Holmes' terse description of this voyage is\r\nsufficiently illuminating without elaboration. \"The time occupied was\r\nthirty-six days,\" he says; \"and the maximum speed attained was about 6½\r\nknots. The vessel pitched horribly!\"\r\n\r\nTwo full centuries before the discovery of America the rudder had\r\nbeen invented. There is no record to show who was responsible for\r\nthis innovation, although its superiority over the older steering\r\nappliances must have been appreciated fully. But after the beginning of\r\nthe fourteenth century the rudder seems to have come into general use,\r\nentirely supplanting the older side-rudder, or clavus.\r\n\r\n\r\nMODERN SAILING SHIPS\r\n\r\nFor a full century after the voyage of Columbus little progress was\r\nmade in ship construction; short, stocky boats, with many decks high\r\nabove the water-line at bow and stem continuing to be the most popular\r\ntype. In the opening years of the seventeenth century, however,\r\nthe English naval architect, Phineas Pett, departed from many of\r\nthe accepted standards of his time, and produced ships not unlike\r\nmodern full-rigged sailing vessels, except that the stern was still\r\nconsiderably elevated, and the bow of peculiar construction. One of\r\nPett's ships, _The Sovereign of the Seas_, was a vessel 167 feet long,\r\nwith 48 foot beam, and of 1,683 tons burthen. The introduction of this\r\ntype of vessel was a distinct step forward toward modern shipbuilding.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE OLD AND THE NEW--A CONTRAST\r\n\r\nThe replica of Henry Hudson's famous _Half Moon_, a typical fighting\r\nship of the 16th century, and a modern submarine. The photograph\r\nwas taken in New York Harbor during the Hudson-Fulton celebration,\r\nSeptember, 1909.]\r\n\r\nThe tendency of shipbuilders during the eighteenth century was to\r\nincrease the length of vessels in proportion to the breadth of beam\r\nand diminish the depth of the hull and superstructures, above the\r\nwater line, with improved sailing qualities. England's extensive trade\r\nwith India and the far East was conducive to this development, as the\r\n\"East Indiamen\" were necessarily a combination of merchant vessel and\r\nbattleship.\r\n\r\nIn the first half of the nineteenth century America rose to great\r\ncommercial importance thanks to her fleets of fine sailing vessels.\r\nSpeed rather than strength in their ships was the aim of American\r\nship-builders, to gain which they built boats proportionately longer\r\nand narrower than ever constructed before for ocean traffic. The\r\nculminating type of wooden sailing ship was represented by the\r\n\"Baltimore clippers,\" in which the length was five, and even six,\r\ntimes the beam, with light rigging and improved mechanical devices for\r\nhandling it, whereby the amount of manual labor was greatly lessened.\r\nOne of these ships, the _Great Republic_, built in 1853, was over three\r\nhundred feet long, and 3,400 tons register. She was a four-masted\r\nvessel, fitted with double topsails, with a spread of canvas about\r\n4,500 square yards.\r\n\r\nThe modern descendant of the wooden clipper ship is the schooner with\r\nfrom four to six masts. Some of these vessels exceed the older boats\r\nin size and carrying capacity, if not in speed. Perhaps the largest\r\nschooner ever constructed is the _Wyoming_, which was completed at\r\nBath, Maine, early in the year 1910. This vessel is 329 feet long\r\nand 50 feet broad. It has a carrying capacity of 6,000 tons. The\r\nconstruction of such a vessel at so recent a period suggests that the\r\nday of the sailing ship is by no means over notwithstanding that a\r\nfull century has elapsed since the coming of the steamboat. Here, as\r\nso often elsewhere in the history of progress, it has happened that\r\nthe full development of a type has not been reached until the ultimate\r\ndoom of that type, except for special purposes, had been irrevocably\r\nsealed. Ever since the full development of the steamboat in the early\r\ndecades of the nineteenth century, the sailing ship has seemed almost\r\nan anachronism; and yet, in point of fact, the steamship did not at\r\nonce outrival its more primitive forerunner. Even in the matter of\r\nspeed, the sailing ship more than held its own for a generation or\r\nso after the steamship had been placed in commission. In 1851 the\r\nAmerican clipper _Flying Cloud_ made 427 knots in twenty-four hours;\r\nand _The Sovereign of the Seas_ bettered this by averaging over\r\neighteen miles an hour for twenty-four consecutive hours. The Atlantic\r\nrecord for sailing vessels is usually said to have been made in 1862\r\nby the clipper ship _Dreadnought_ in a passage between Queenstown\r\nand New York, the time of which is stated as nine days and seventeen\r\nhours. It should be remarked, however, that the authenticity of this\r\nextraordinary performance has been challenged.\r\n\r\nBe that as it may, it is certain that the speediest sailing ships,\r\ngranted favorable conditions of wind and wave, more than surpassed\r\nthe best efforts of the steamship until about the closing decades of\r\nthe nineteenth century. But of course long before this the steamship\r\nhad proved its supremacy under all ordinary conditions. Even though\r\nsailing ships continued to be constructed in large numbers, their\r\npicturesque rigging became less and less a feature in all navigable\r\nwaters, and the belching funnel of the steamship had become a\r\ncharacteristic substitute as typifying the sea-going vessel.\r\n\r\nThe story of the development of this new queen of the waters must now\r\ndemand our attention. It begins with the futile efforts of several more\r\nor less visionary enthusiasts who were contemporaries of James Watt,\r\nand who thought they saw great possibilities in the steam engine as a\r\nmotive power to take the place of oars and sails for the propulsion of\r\nships.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY ATTEMPTS TO INVENT A STEAMBOAT\r\n\r\nAmong the first of these was an American named John Fitch. Judged by\r\nthe practical results of his efforts, he was not a highly successful\r\ninventor; as a prophet, however, and as an experimenter whose efforts\r\nfell just short of attainment, he deserves a conspicuous place in the\r\nhistory of an epoch-making discovery. Yet his prophecy was based on his\r\nfailures. From 1780, for twenty years he strove to perfect a steamboat.\r\nHis efforts did not carry him far beyond the experimental stage. But\r\nhis courage and enthusiasm never waned. \"Whether I bring the steamboat\r\nto perfection or not,\" he declared, \"it will some time in the future be\r\nthe mode of crossing the Atlantic for packets and armed vessels.\"\r\n\r\nAt that very time Benjamin Franklin said this would never be. But\r\ntwenty years later Fulton's _Clermont_ paddled up the Hudson River\r\nfrom New York to Albany and opened the era that saw Fitch's prophecy\r\nfulfilled. This was in 1807--a year that must stand as the most\r\nmomentous in maritime history. In that year the little _Clermont_\r\nsteamed slowly from New York to Albany, a distance of one hundred\r\nand fifty miles in thirty-two hours, unaided by sails or oars, and\r\npropelled entirely by steam-power. A sail-boat could cover the distance\r\nin the same number of hours; a modern torpedo boat in one-sixth the\r\ntime. Yet no performance of any boat, before or since, had such\r\nfar-reaching effects upon the progress of the world.\r\n\r\nWhen Fulton turned his attention from his favorite theme--the invention\r\nof a submarine boat--and took up the question of perfecting a boat\r\npropelled by steam, he did not find himself the first or the only\r\ninventor in the field. For a hundred years, in round numbers, men had\r\nbeen wrestling with the question of applying steam pressure to boat\r\npropulsion. All manner of more or less ingenious devices had been\r\nconceived, most of them having a germ of success in the principles\r\ninvolved, but all of them being failures in actual practice.\r\n\r\nAmong the most promising of these first steamboats were those in which\r\nthe propeller, or the paddle-wheel, was tried; but neither of these\r\nmethods was looked upon favorably at first. Less promising was one in\r\nwhich the motive power was a jet of water pumped through a submerged\r\ntube--a principle that still periodically fascinates certain modern\r\ninventors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MARINE ENGINES AND AN EARLY TYPE OF STEAMBOAT.\r\n\r\nThe small figure in the centre represents a very remarkable steamboat\r\nconstructed in America by John Fitch. The precise date of its\r\nconstruction is not clearly established, but the inventor had made\r\nefforts at steam navigation as early as 1776. The upper figure shows a\r\nmarine engine made in Scotland in 1788 for Patrick Miller by William\r\nSymington. It was used to equip a double-hulled pleasure boat which it\r\nis said to have propelled at the rate of five miles an hour. The motive\r\npower is supplied by two open-top Newcomen cylinders. The lower figure\r\nrepresents a modern side wheel steamer with oscillating engines.]\r\n\r\nBut the boats that seemed to have come nearer attaining practical\r\nsuccess for the moment were those in which several sets of oars\r\nworked by steam were placed vertically on each side of the hull, the\r\nmachinery so arranged that the oars were dipped into the water and\r\ndrawn sternward by one motion of the machinery, raised and carried\r\ntoward the bow by the opposite motion. In some of these boats it was\r\nplanned to have four sets of oars, two sets on each side, which were to\r\nwork alternately, so that while one set was traveling forward through\r\nthe air, its mate would be paddling through the water, thus insuring a\r\ncontinuous forward impulse. But the machinery for these boats proved\r\nto be too cumbersome and complicated for practical results, and this\r\nidea was finally abandoned. The jet of water did not prove any more\r\nsuccessful, and but two other methods were available--the propeller and\r\nthe paddle-wheel.\r\n\r\nBoth of these methods of utilizing the power of moving water had been\r\nfamiliar in the form of the Archimedian screw and the commonplace\r\novershot or undershot mill-wheel. In these examples, of course,\r\nthe force of the water was used to move machinery, reversing the\r\naction of the paddle-wheel of the boat. And yet the principles were\r\nidentical. Obviously if the conditions were reversed, and the undershot\r\nmill-wheel, for example, forced against the water with corresponding\r\npower, the propulsive effect might be great enough--since action and\r\nreaction are equal--to move a boat of considerable size. But curiously\r\nenough, at the time when Fulton began his experiments there was a wave\r\nof general belief that when this principle was applied to boats it\r\nwould fail. The reason for this lay in the fact that several such boats\r\nhad been built from time to time, and all had failed. The fault, of\r\ncourse, lay in some other place than in their paddle wheels; but for\r\nthe time being the wheel, and not the machinery, was shouldered with\r\nthe blame.\r\n\r\nJust a hundred years before Fulton finally produced his practical\r\npaddle-wheel steamboat, a prototype was built by the Spaniard, Blasco\r\nde Gary. In 1707, this inventor constructed a model paddle-wheel\r\nsteamboat, and tried it upon the river Fulda. But this model boat\r\nfailed to work, and the experiment was soon forgotten.\r\n\r\nTwenty-five years later Jonathan Hulls of England patented a marine\r\nengine which he proposed to use in a boat which was to be propelled by\r\na stern wheel. His idea was to use his boats as tug- or tow-boats, and\r\nto equip the larger vessels themselves with steam. But his engines were\r\ndefective and his boats did not achieve commercial success.\r\n\r\nDuring the time of the American Revolution, a French inventor, the\r\nMarquis de Jouffroy, made several interesting experiments with\r\nsteam-propelled boats, using the principle of the paddle which was\r\ndipped and raised alternately as referred to a few pages back. His\r\nboats made several public trials, one of them ascending the Seine\r\nagainst the current; but nevertheless, the French government refused\r\nto grant the inventor a patent. Presumably, therefore, the boat was\r\nnot considered a practical success in official circles; and this view\r\nis tacitly conceded by the fact that no more boats of its type were\r\nconstructed. Had they been really practical steamboats it is a fair\r\npresumption that others would have been constructed and put into\r\noperation, regardless of patents. Nevertheless, in France to-day,\r\nthe Marquis de Jouffroy is often referred to as the father of steam\r\nnavigation.\r\n\r\nThe idea of propelling a boat by means of a jet of water pumped out at\r\nthe stern by steam pumps was given a practical test in 1784, by James\r\nRumsey. His boat made a trial trip on the Potomac River in September\r\nof that year, General Washington and other army officers being present\r\non this occasion. The boat was able to make fairly good progress\r\nthrough the water, and seemed so promising that a company was formed\r\nby capitalists known as the Rumsey Society, for promoting the idea and\r\nbuilding more boats. Rumsey was sent to England where he undertook the\r\nconstruction of another boat, meanwhile taking out patents in Great\r\nBritain, France, and Holland. Before his boat was completed, however,\r\nhe died suddenly, and the Rumsey Society passed out of existence\r\nshortly afterwards.\r\n\r\nAn even closer approach to practical success was made in Scotland by\r\nJames Symington, who in 1788, in association with two other Scotchmen,\r\nMiller and Taylor, constructed a boat consisting of two hulls, with a\r\npaddle-wheel between them worked by a steam-engine. This boat worked\r\nso well that in 1801, Lord Dundas engaged Symington to build a smaller\r\nboat to be used for towing on the Caledonian Canal. This boat, called\r\nthe _Charlotte Dundas_, completed in 1802, is said to have been capable\r\nof towing a vessel of one hundred and forty tons \"nearly four miles an\r\nhour.\" But in doing this the resulting \"wash\" so threatened the banks\r\nof the canal that the vessel was laid up and finally rotted and fell to\r\npieces.\r\n\r\nBy many impartial judges this boat is considered the first practical\r\nsteamboat, and its failure to establish its claim due to the force\r\nof circumstances rather than to any inherent defects. Symington was\r\ntoo poor to pursue his work independently, and was deterred by the\r\nattitude of James Watt, who \"predicted the failure of his engine,\r\nand threatened him with legal penalties if it succeeded.\" And when at\r\nlast he received an order for eight smaller vessels from the Duke of\r\nBridgewater, his patron died before the details of the agreement had\r\nbeen completed. So that while he failed in accomplishing what was done\r\nby Fulton a few years later, it is certain that, as Woodcraft says, \"He\r\ncombined for the first time those improvements which constitute the\r\npresent system of steam navigation.\"\r\n\r\nSome of Symington's engines have been preserved, and one of them is now\r\nin the Patent Office Museum in London. Since the beginning of practical\r\nsteam navigation this engine has been tested several times, the result\r\nshowing that Woodcraft's estimate is not overdrawn.\r\n\r\nWhile Symington was thus perfecting a paddle-boat, an American, Col.\r\nJohn Stevens of Hoboken, New Jersey, was on the verge of accomplishing\r\nthe same end with a screw-propeller boat--a form of steamship that did\r\nnot come into use until some forty years later.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE STEAMSHIPS \"CHARLOTTE DUNDAS\" AND \"CLERMONT.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"Charlotte Dundas\" (lower figure) was built in 1801 by A. Hart at\r\nGrangemouth, Scotland, and engined by William Symington, for service on\r\nthe Forth and Clyde Canal. Its length was 56 feet; beam 18 feet; depth\r\n8 feet. The boat was a practical success, but its use was discontinued\r\nbecause of the damage done to the banks of the Canal by the wash of\r\nthe paddles. The upper left-hand figure is a picture of Fulton's\r\n\"Clermont.\" The diagram at the right represents the \"Clermont's\" paddle\r\nwheels and the mechanism by which they were worked.]\r\n\r\nStevens also invented what he called a \"rotary engine\" which was really\r\nan engine constructed on the same principle as the modern turbine\r\nengine. It was a small affair which he placed in a skiff, and used for\r\nturning the screw-propeller of a boat which was able to travel at a\r\nrate of three or four miles an hour on the North River, during the fall\r\nof 1802. But Stevens found so much difficulty in packing the blades of\r\nthis engine without causing too much friction that he finally abandoned\r\nit for the more common type of reciprocating engine. But if this little\r\nsteamboat had its defects, it nevertheless contained the germs of two\r\ngreat features of steam navigation--the screw propeller and the turbine\r\nengine, the advantage of the first of which was not recognized for\r\nnearly half a century, and the other not until almost a full century\r\nlater.\r\n\r\nIn 1804 Stevens produced another propeller steamboat, this one using\r\nthe ordinary type of reciprocating engine, and being notable for having\r\ntwin screws of a pattern practically identical with the screws now in\r\nuse. This boat was able to steam at a rate of four miles an hour on\r\nmany occasions, and at times almost double this rate, according to some\r\nobservers. The engines of this boat are still in existence, and on\r\nseveral occasions since 1804 have been placed in hulls corresponding\r\nas nearly as possible to the original, and have demonstrated that\r\nthey could force the boat through the water at six or eight miles an\r\nhour. These engines in a modern hull were exhibited at the Columbian\r\nExposition at Chicago, in 1893. They supply irrefutable evidence that\r\nthe practical steamboat had been invented at least three years before\r\nFulton's historic voyage in 1807. Yet no one questions that it was\r\nFulton's, not Stevens', invention that inaugurated steam navigation.\r\n\r\nJust why this was so is a little difficult to comprehend at this time,\r\nunless it was that Stevens' boat was such a small affair that it did\r\nnot attract the attention it deserved, as did Fulton's larger boat.\r\nAnd yet we should not be guided too much by retrospective judgment.\r\nThe significant fact remains that Stevens himself did not have entire\r\nconfidence in his boat, or in the principle of his screw propeller, as\r\nis shown by the fact that three years later, while Fulton was building\r\nthe _Clermont_, Stevens was also constructing a steamboat, not along\r\nthe lines of his previous inventions, but as a paddle-wheel boat. This\r\nleaves little room for doubt that Stevens had not full confidence in\r\nthe propeller; and when an inventor himself mistrusts his own device,\r\nthere is little likelihood that anyone else will supply the necessary\r\nconfidence. This may account for the fact that Stevens found difficulty\r\nin securing financial backing for his enterprise; and when such backing\r\nwas found it was for the construction of the paddle-wheel boat, which\r\nwas finished a few months after Fulton's boat had solved the problem of\r\nsteam navigation.\r\n\r\n\r\nFULTON AND THE CLERMONT\r\n\r\nAs we shall see in another place, Fulton was no novice in the\r\nconstruction of peculiar boats at this time. He had built experimental\r\nboats both at home and abroad, was familiar with the principle of the\r\nscrew and the paddle-wheel, and had come to have absolute confidence\r\nin the possibility of propelling boats at a good rate of speed by the\r\nuse of steam. When he began his now famous _Clermont_, in the spring of\r\n1807, it was not as an experimental skiff, but as a boat of one hundred\r\nand fifty tons burden--half again the size of the boats in which\r\nColumbus had discovered America--to be placed in commission between\r\nAlbany and New York city. By August, this boat was completed, and the\r\nengines in place, and, under her own steam, the new boat was moved\r\nfrom the Jersey shipyard where she was constructed, and tied up at a\r\nNew York dock. On August 7th, she started on her maiden trip up the\r\nHudson. To the astonishment of practically every one of the persons in\r\nthe great throng that had gathered along the shores, she left her dock\r\nin due course, and with wind and tide against her, steamed up the river\r\nat the rate of about five miles an hour. At this speed she covered\r\nthe entire distance between New York and Albany, settling forever the\r\nquestion of the practicability of steam navigation.\r\n\r\nThe impression this fire-belching monster made upon the sleepy\r\ninhabitants as it passed along the river can be readily imagined. An\r\neye-witness account of this first passage of the _Clermont_ has been\r\ngiven by an inhabitant at the half-way point near Poughkeepsie.\r\n\r\n\"It was the early autumn in 1807,\" he wrote, \"that a knot of villagers\r\nwas gathered on the high bluff just opposite Poughkeepsie, on the\r\nwest bank of the Hudson, attracted by the appearance of a strange,\r\ndark-looking craft which was slowly making its way up the river. Some\r\nimagined it to be a sea-monster, while others did not hesitate to\r\nexpress their belief that it was a sign of the approaching Judgment.\r\nWhat seemed strange in the vessel was the substitution of lofty and\r\nstraight black smoke-pipes, rising from the deck, instead of the\r\ngracefully tapered masts that commonly stood on the vessels navigating\r\nthe stream; and, in place of spars and rigging, the curious play of the\r\nworking-beam and pistons, and the slow turning and splashing of the\r\nhuge, naked paddle-wheels, met the astonished gaze. The dense clouds of\r\nsmoke as they rose wave upon wave, added still more to the wonderment\r\nof the rustics.\r\n\r\n\"This strange looking craft was the _Clermont_, on her trial trip to\r\nAlbany. On her return-trip, the curiosity she excited was scarcely\r\nless intense--the whole country talked of nothing but the sea-monster,\r\nbelching fire and smoke. The fishermen became terrified and rowed\r\nhomewards, and they saw nothing but destruction devastating their\r\nfishing grounds; whilst the wreaths of black vapor, and rushing noise\r\nof the paddle-wheels, foaming with the stirred-up water, produced great\r\nexcitement among the boatmen.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CLERMONT\r\n\r\nThe replica of Robert Fulton's first steamboat which took part in the\r\nHudson-Fulton celebration in September, 1909. The small picture shows\r\none of the paddle-wheels in detail. The original _Clermont_, the first\r\ncommercially successful steamboat, was put in commission for the New\r\nYork-Albany service in 1807.]\r\n\r\nWhile acknowledging fully Fulton's right to the claim of being \"the\r\nfather of steam navigation,\" as he has been called, there is no\r\nevidence to show that he introduced any new principle or discovery\r\nin his application of steam to the _Clermont_. The boiler, engine,\r\npaddle-wheel--every part of the boat had been known for years. Yet\r\nthis does not detract from the glory of Fulton, who first combined\r\nthis scattered knowledge in a practical way, and demonstrated the\r\npracticality beyond question.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEA-GOING STEAMSHIPS\r\n\r\nThe first war steamer and ocean steamer ever attempted was built by\r\nFulton, in 1813. It was called the _Demolgos_, and was not a practical\r\nsuccess, and made no attempts to take protracted ocean voyages. The\r\nfirst steamship to cross was the _Savannah_ in 1819. She made the\r\nvoyage from Savannah to Liverpool in twenty-five days, using her\r\npaddle-wheels part of the time, but at other times depending entirely\r\nupon her sails. She was a boat of three hundred and fifty tons, and her\r\npaddle-wheels were arranged so that they could be hauled in upon the\r\ndeck and stowed away in bad weather.\r\n\r\nFollowing the _Savannah_ several similar combination sailing and\r\nsteam-propelled boats were constructed, the navigators coming to have\r\nmore and more faith in the possibilities of steam, so that less sail\r\nwas carried. These vessels continued to reduce the time of the passage\r\nbetween Europe and America, until the voyage had been made in about\r\nseventeen days. Then, in 1838, two vessels, the _Sirius_ and the _Great\r\nWestern_, for the first time using steam alone as motive power, made\r\nrecord voyages, the _Great Western_ crossing in twelve days, seven and\r\na half hours. This was considered remarkable time--an average speed of\r\nover two hundred miles a day. Something like four hundred and fifty\r\ntons of coal were consumed on the voyage, which impressed many as a\r\ngreat extravagance of fuel. Some of the ocean liners at present consume\r\nmore than twice this amount in a single day.\r\n\r\nOn July 4, 1840, the _Britannia_, the first steamer of the Cunard\r\nLine, started on its maiden voyage from Liverpool to Boston. The\r\nvoyage was made in fourteen days, among the passengers being Samuel\r\nCunard, a Quaker of Halifax, who was the founder of the enterprise.\r\nThe population of Boston went mad on the arrival of this boat; streets\r\nand buildings were decorated, and the day was given over to the\r\nregular holiday amusements. Cunard received upward of eighteen hundred\r\ninvitations to dinner that evening.\r\n\r\nThe year 1840, then, may be considered as one of the vital years\r\nin the progress of steam navigation. Since that time no year has\r\npassed without seeing some important addition and improvement made\r\nin the conquest of the ocean, either in size, shape, or speed of the\r\n\"greyhounds.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSHIPS BUILT OF IRON AND STEEL\r\n\r\nEven before the introduction of steam as a motive power for boats\r\nshipbuilders had been casting about for some satisfactory substitute\r\nfor wood in the construction of vessels. One reason for this was that\r\nsuitable wood was becoming scarce and very expensive. But also there\r\nwas a limit to the size that a wooden vessel might be built with\r\nsafety. A wooden boat more than three hundred feet long cannot be\r\nconstructed without having dangerous structural weakness.\r\n\r\nNaturally the idea that the only suitable material for boat-building\r\nwas something lighter than water,--something that would float--which\r\nhad been handed down traditionally for thousands of years, could not be\r\novercome in a moment. And surely such a heavy substance as iron would\r\nnot be likely to suggest itself to the average ship-builder. But at the\r\nbeginning of the nineteenth century rapid strides were being made in\r\ntheoretical, as well as applied science, and the idea of using metal in\r\nplace of wood for shipbuilding began to take practical form.\r\n\r\nRichard Trevithick, whose remarkable experiments in locomotive building\r\nhave been noted in another chapter, had planned an iron ship as early\r\nas 1809. He did not actually construct a vessel, but he made detailed\r\nplans of one--not merely a boat with an iron hull, but with decks,\r\nbeams, masts, yards, and spars made of the same material. It was nearly\r\nten years after Trevithick drew his plans, however, before the first\r\niron ship was constructed. Then Thomas Wilson of Glasgow built a vessel\r\non practically the same lines suggested by Trevithick.\r\n\r\nThis vessel, finished in 1818, and called the _Vulcan_, was the pioneer\r\nof all iron boats. For at least sixty years it remained in active\r\nservice. Indeed, for aught that is known to the contrary, this first\r\niron boat may be still in use in some capacity.\r\n\r\nOne of the most surprising and interesting things to shipbuilders\r\nabout the _Vulcan_, and the boats that were constructed after her,\r\nwas the fact that they were actually lighter in proportion to their\r\ncarrying capacity than ships of corresponding size built of wood. In\r\nwooden cargo ships the weight of the hull and fittings varies from 35\r\nto 45 per cent. of the total displacement, while iron vessels vary from\r\n25 to 30 per cent. This was a vital point in favor of the iron vessel,\r\nand one that appealed directly to practical builders. But the public\r\nat large looked askance at the new vessels. To \"sink like a stone\" was\r\nproverbial; and everyone knows that iron sinks quite as readily as\r\nstone.\r\n\r\nBut very soon a convincing demonstration of the strength of iron\r\nvessels brought them into favor. A great storm, sweeping along the\r\ncoast of Great Britain in 1835, drove many vessels on shore, among them\r\nan iron steamboat just making her maiden voyage. The wooden vessels\r\nwithout exception were wrecked, most of them destroyed, but the iron\r\nvessel, although subjected to the same conditions, escaped without\r\ninjury, thanks to the material and method of her construction.\r\n\r\nFrom that time the position of the iron steamship was assured. And\r\nwhereas sea voyagers had formerly looked askance at iron passenger\r\nboats they now began to distrust those built of wood. By the middle of\r\nthe century, iron shipbuilding was at its height, and in the decade\r\nimmediately following, the _Great Eastern_ was finished--possibly the\r\nlargest and most remarkable structure ever built of iron, on land or\r\nsea. In recent years larger ships have been constructed, but these\r\nships are made of steel.\r\n\r\nThe _Great Eastern_ marked an epoch in shipbuilding. In size she was a\r\ngeneration ahead of her time, but the innovations in the method of her\r\nconstruction gave the cue to modern revolutionary shipbuilding methods.\r\nSir George C. V. Holmes gives the following account of the great ship:\r\n\r\n\"She was originally intended by the famous engineer, Mr. I. K. Brunel,\r\nto trade between England and the East. She was designed to make the\r\nvoyage to Australia without calling anywhere _en route_ to coal, a feat\r\nwhich, in the then state of steam-engine economy, no other vessel could\r\naccomplish. It was supposed that this advantage, coupled with the high\r\nspeed expected from her great length, would secure for her the command\r\nof the enormous cargoes which would be necessary to fill her. Mr.\r\nBrunel communicated his idea that such a vessel should be constructed\r\nfor the trade to the East to the famous engineer and shipbuilder, the\r\nlate Mr. John Scott Russell, F.R.S., and he further persuaded his\r\nclients, the directors of the Eastern Steam Navigation Company, of the\r\nsoundness of his views, for they resolved that the projected vessel\r\nshould be built for their company, and entrusted the contract for its\r\nexecution to the firm of John Scott Russell & Co., of Millwall.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Scott Russell and Mr. Brunel were, between them, entitled to the\r\ncredit of the design, which, on account of the exceptional size of the\r\nship, presented special difficulties, and involved a total departure\r\nfrom ordinary practice.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Scott Russell had systematically, in his own previous practice,\r\nconstructed iron ships with cellular bottoms, but the cells had only\r\nfive sides, the uppermost side on the inside being uncovered. Over\r\na large portion, however, of the bottom of the _Great Eastern_ the\r\ncells were completed by the addition of an inner bottom, which added\r\ngreatly both to the strength and to the safety of the ship. It was\r\nalso Mr. Brunel's idea that the great ship should be propelled by both\r\npaddles and screw. Mr. Scott Russell was responsible for the lines and\r\ndimensions, and also for the longitudinal system of framing, with its\r\nnumerous complete and partial transverse and longitudinal bulkheads.\r\n\r\n\"The following are some of the principal dimensions and other _data_ of\r\nthe _Great Eastern_:\r\n\r\n    Length between perpendiculars                       680 feet\r\n    Length on upper deck                                692  \"\r\n    Extreme breadth of hull                              83  \"\r\n    Width over paddle-box                               120  \"\r\n    Depth from upper deck to keel                        58  \"\r\n    Draught of water (laden)                             30  \"\r\n    Weight of iron used in construction              10,000 tons\r\n    Number of plates used in construction            30,000\r\n    Number of rivets used in construction         3,000,000\r\n    Tonnage, gross                                   18,914 tons\r\n    Nominal power of paddle engine                    1,000 H. P.\r\n    Nominal power of screw engines                    1,600   \"\r\n\r\n\"The accommodation for passengers was on an unprecedented scale. There\r\nwere no less than five saloons on the upper, and as many on the lower\r\ndeck, the aggregate length of the principal apartments being 400 feet.\r\nThere was accommodation for 800 first-class, 2,000 second-class, and\r\n1,200 third-class passengers, and the crew numbered 400. The upper\r\ndeck, which was of a continuous iron-plated and cellular structure,\r\nran flush from stem to stern, and was twenty feet wide on each side of\r\nthe hatchways; thus two spacious promenades were provided, each over a\r\nfurlong in length. The capacity for coal and cargo was 18,000 tons.\r\n\r\n\"The attempts to launch this vessel were most disastrous, and cost no\r\nless than £120,000, an expense which ruined the company. The original\r\ncompany was wound up, and the great ship sold for £160,000 to a new\r\ncompany, and was completed in the year 1859. The new company very\r\nunwisely determined to put her on the American station, for which she\r\nwas in no way suited. During her preliminary trip the pilot reported\r\nthat she made a speed of fully 14 knots at two-thirds of full pressure,\r\nbut the highest rate of speed which she attained on this occasion was\r\n15 knots, and on her first journey across the Atlantic the average\r\nspeed was nearly 14 knots, the greatest distance run in a day having\r\nbeen 333 nautical miles. The great value of the system adopted in her\r\nconstruction was proved by an accident which occurred during one of her\r\nTransatlantic voyages. She ran against a pointed rock, but the voyage\r\nwas continued without hindrance. It was afterwards found that holes of\r\nthe combined length of over 100 feet had been torn in her outer bottom;\r\nbut, thanks to the inner water-tight skin, no water was admitted.\"\r\n\r\nBetween the years 1860 and 1870 great improvements were made in marine\r\nengines, and screw-steamers very generally replaced side-wheel boats\r\nfor ocean traffic. The improvements in the engines consisted largely\r\nin the use of higher pressures, surface condensation, and compounding\r\nof the cylinders, which resulted in a saving of about half the amount\r\nof fuel over engines of the older type. As a result steamers were able\r\nto compete successfully with the sailing ships, even as freighters for\r\nlong voyages, such as those between Europe and Australia.\r\n\r\nDuring the reactive period in France immediately following the\r\nFranco-Prussian war, when there was great activity in shipbuilding,\r\nthe use of mild steel plates in place of wrought iron was tried. The\r\nsuperiority of this material over iron was quickly demonstrated, and\r\nas the cost of steel was constantly lessening, thanks to the newly\r\ndiscovered methods of production, steel practically replaced iron in\r\nship construction after this time.\r\n\r\nIt was during this same period that a new type of passenger steamer was\r\nproduced--the \"ocean greyhound.\" The first of these was the _Oceanic_,\r\nbuilt by the White Star Company in 1871. This ship was remarkable in\r\nmany ways. Her length, four hundred and twenty feet, was more than\r\nten times her beam; iron railings were substituted for bulwarks; and\r\nthe passenger quarters were shifted from the position near the stern\r\nto the middle of the vessel. All these changes proved to be distinct\r\nimprovements, and the _Oceanic_ became at once the most popular, as\r\nwell as the fastest ocean liner.\r\n\r\nLike all the other boats of the seventies and early eighties, the\r\n_Oceanic_ was a single-screw vessel. The advantage of double propellers\r\nin case of accident had long been recognized, but hitherto twin-screws\r\nhad not proved as efficient as a single screw in developing speed. But\r\nin 1888 the _City of Paris_ (now the _Philadelphia_) a twin-screw boat,\r\nbegan making new speed records, and the following year her sister ship,\r\nthe _New York_, and the new _Majestic_ and _Teutonic_, entering into\r\nthe ocean-record contests, cut the time of the passage between Europe\r\nand America to less than six days.\r\n\r\nThe advantages of the double-screw over the single are so many and so\r\nmanifest as to leave no question as to their superiority. The disabling\r\nof the shaft or screw of the single-screw steamer, or the derangement\r\nof her rudder renders the vessel helpless. Not so the twin-screw ship;\r\nfor on such ships the screws can be used for steering as well as\r\npropelling. And it has happened many times that twin-screw ships have\r\ncrossed the ocean with the steering gear disabled, or with one screw\r\nentirely out of commission.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TRIUMPH OF THE TURBINE\r\n\r\nIn recent years the greatest revolutionary step in steamship\r\nconstruction has been the invention and development of the turbine\r\nengine, the mechanism of which has been described elsewhere. Since\r\nthe day of the little _Turbinia_, whose speed astonished the nautical\r\nworld, the limit for size and speed of ships has again been materially\r\nadvanced, and no thinking person will venture to predict restricting\r\nlimits without a modifying question mark.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the twentieth century a keen rivalry had developed\r\nbetween England and the Continent for supremacy in transatlantic\r\ntraffic, America having dropped out of the race. The Germans in\r\nparticular had produced fast boats, such as the _Deutschland_ and\r\n_Kaiser Wilhelm II_, which for several years held the ocean record for\r\nspeed. But meanwhile the turbine engine was being perfected in England,\r\nthe land of its invention, and presently turbine \"greyhounds\" began\r\ncrossing the ocean and menacing the records held by the boats equipped\r\nwith the older type of engine.\r\n\r\nThe reciprocating marine engine, however, had been steadily improved,\r\nuntil it was a marvel in efficiency. Quadruple expansion engines\r\ndriving twin-screws of a size and shape known to develop the greatest\r\nefficiency, for several years offered invincible competition to the new\r\ntype of engine. There were new conditions to be met, new difficulties\r\nto be overcome.\r\n\r\nA decisive test of the merits of the turbine engine was given in\r\n1905, when the Cunard Company built two vessels, the _Caronia_ and\r\n_Carmania_, of exactly the same size and shape, the _Caronia_ having\r\nthe highest type of quadruple expansion reciprocating engines, while\r\nthe _Carmania_ was equipped with turbine engines. Here was a fair\r\ntest of efficiency between the two types. And the turbine boat proved\r\nherself the better of the two by developing more than a knot greater\r\nspeed per hour.\r\n\r\nStill the _Carmania_ offered no serious competition in speed to\r\nseveral of the German flyers. But in 1908 two more turbine ships,\r\nthe _Lusitania_ and _Mauretania_ began making regular transatlantic\r\nvoyages, and quickly distanced all competitors.\r\n\r\nIn size as well as in speed these sister ships mark an epoch in\r\nnavigation. Turbine engines take the place of the usual reciprocating\r\ntype, acting on four propellers for going ahead, and two separate\r\npropellers for going astern. These engines develop 68,000 horse-power.\r\nStated in this way these figures convey little idea of the power\r\ndeveloped. But when we say that it would take a line of horses one\r\nhundred and twenty miles long hitched tandem to develop the power\r\ngenerated in the compact space of the _Mauretania's_ engine room, some\r\nidea of the power is gained.\r\n\r\nIt is not the matter of power, size, or speed alone that makes the\r\ntwentieth century passenger steamer so completely outclass her\r\npredecessors. It is really the matter of comfort and safety afforded\r\nthe ocean travelers. Safety against sinking from injury to the hull\r\nwas provided for by the introduction of watertight compartments half a\r\ncentury ago, as we have seen; and the size of the _Great Eastern_ has\r\nbeen surpassed in only a few instances. But it is since the beginning\r\nof the present century that two revolutionary safety devices have been\r\nperfected--wireless telegraphy and the submarine signaling apparatus.\r\nThe wireless apparatus has been described in another chapter, and as\r\nit is used almost as much on land as at sea, cannot be considered as\r\nsolely a nautical appliance. But the submarine signaling device, which\r\nis dependent upon water for transmission, is essentially a nautical\r\nmechanism.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBMARINE SIGNALING\r\n\r\nIt is difficult for the average landsman to appreciate that the one\r\nthing most dreaded by mariners is fog. Dark and boisterous nights\r\nwhich frighten the distressed landsman have no terrors for the sailor.\r\nGiven an open sea-way he knows that he can ride out any gale that\r\nblows. It is the foggy night that fills him with apprehension.\r\n\r\nIn perfectly still weather the sound of the fog horn carries far\r\nenough, and indicates location well enough so that two ships\r\napproaching each other, or a ship approaching a bell buoy, can detect\r\nits location and avoid danger. But this is under favorable conditions;\r\nand unfortunately such conditions do not always prevail. And if there\r\nis a wind stirring or the sea running high atmospheric sounds cannot be\r\ndepended upon. A fog whistle whose sound ought to carry several miles\r\nunder ordinary conditions, may not be heard more than a ship's length\r\naway. And scores of accidents, such as collisions between ships, have\r\nhappened in fogs, when both vessels were sounding their fog whistles at\r\nregular intervals.\r\n\r\nWhen wireless telegraphy was perfected sufficiently to be of\r\npractical use, great hopes were entertained that this discovery could\r\nbe used to give warning and prevent accidents to fog-bound vessels. But\r\nexperience has shown that its usefulness is confined largely to that\r\nof calling for help after the accident, rather than in preventing it.\r\nThus in 1908 when the wireless operator on board the steamer _Republic_\r\nflashed his message broadcast telling ships and shore-stations for\r\nhundreds of miles around that his vessel had been run down in a fog\r\nand was sinking, he could only give the vessels that hurried to the\r\n_Republic's_ aid an approximate idea of where they could find her. The\r\nuse of another electric appliance, of even more recent invention than\r\nthe wireless telegraph, was necessary for locating the exact position\r\nof the stricken ship. This was the submarine signaling device, which\r\nutilizes water instead of air as a medium for transmitting sound.\r\n\r\nBenjamin Franklin pointed out more than a century ago that water\r\ncarries sound farther and faster than air, and carries it with greater\r\nconstancy. Density, temperature, and motion of the atmosphere act upon\r\naerial sound waves to reflect and refract them in varying degrees;\r\nbut these waves are not affected when water is the medium through\r\nwhich they are passing. The knowledge of these facts was turned to\r\nlittle practical account until the closing years of the last century\r\nwhen Arthur J. Mundy of Boston, and a little later Prof. Elisha Gray\r\nof Chicago, began experiments together that resulted finally in a\r\npractical submarine signaling apparatus which is now installed as\r\na system on boats and buoys in dangerous places along the coasts,\r\nparticularly near the great highways of ocean travel.\r\n\r\nThe principle upon which this system is based is simply that of sound\r\nwaves transmitted through the water and detected at a distance by a\r\nsubmerged electrical transmitter. The sound transmitted is usually\r\nthat of a submerged bell. It is possible for a person whose head is\r\nsubmerged to hear the ringing of such a bell distinctly for a long\r\ndistance; but of course for practical purposes such submergence is out\r\nof the question. The receiving apparatus of the Mundy-Gray signaling\r\ndevice offers a substitute in the form of a submerged \"artificial\r\near\"--an electrical transmitter, connected with a telephone receiver.\r\n\r\nIn the early experiments a small hollow brass ball filled with water\r\nand containing a special form of electrical transmitter was lowered\r\nover the side of a ship and connected by insulated wires to the\r\nreceiver of a telephone in the pilot house. The sound of a submerged\r\nbell could be heard in this manner at a distance of ten or twelve\r\nmiles. The location of the bell could be determined by having two\r\nsuch brass balls, one on each side of the hull of the vessel but not\r\nsubmerged to a depth below that of the hull, so that the ship itself\r\nacts as a screen in obstructing the sound waves coming from the bell.\r\nBy listening alternately to the sounds of the bell transmitted through\r\nthese two submerged balls it was found that the ball on the side of the\r\nship toward the bell gave a distinctly louder sound. By turning the\r\nship so that the sounds were of equal intensity the direction of the\r\nbell could be determined as either directly ahead or astern; and by\r\nusing the compass the exact location could be determined.\r\n\r\nBut such brass-ball transmitters can be used only when the vessel\r\nis moving at a rate not exceeding three miles an hour. They are,\r\ntherefore, of little value for ocean liners whose reduced speed far\r\nexceeds this. But the inventors discovered presently that by using the\r\ninside of the outer steel skin of the ship's hull below the water line\r\nas one side of the brass ball, the transmitter would work equally well.\r\nIndeed, with added improvements, this hollow metal device fastened to\r\nthe inside of the hull on each side, with connecting wires leading to\r\nthe pilot house, in its perfected form will pick up the sound of the\r\nsubmerged bell equally well at any speed, regardless of calm or storm.\r\n\r\nThe chief defect of this arrangement was that the sound of the\r\npulsations of the engines of the ship were also heard, and interfered\r\nseriously with the detection of the sound of the bell. But presently\r\na receiving device was perfected which ignored all sounds but those\r\nof the bell, thus giving the mariner a means of protection against\r\naccidents that could be depended upon absolutely at all times\r\nregardless of speed or weather conditions.\r\n\r\nWhen this stage of perfection of the signaling device was reached\r\nthe various governments began installing the instruments on buoys,\r\nlighthouse sites, and light-ships, using various mechanical devices for\r\nringing the bells, and timing the strokes so that the mariners could\r\ntell by the intervals just what bell he was in touch with, as he knows\r\neach lighthouse by the intervals between the Hashes of its lights. A\r\nfurther development in the signaling device was to equip ships with\r\nsubmerged bells, as well as with the receiving apparatus. In this way\r\ntwo ships could communicate with each other, or with a shore receiving\r\nstation, by using the Morse telegraph code, just as in the case of\r\ntelegraphy.\r\n\r\nThe maximum distance at which such communications may be detected is\r\nabout fifteen miles, and the approximate distance from the bell can be\r\ngauged from the clearness of the sound heard in the telephone receiver.\r\nAt the distance of a quarter of a mile the sound of the bell is so\r\nloud that it is painful to the listener if the receiver is held against\r\nthe ear, while at ten or twelve miles the sound is scarcely audible.\r\n\r\nProbably the most dramatic rescue at sea in recent years was that\r\nof the passengers and crew of the steamer _Republic_, referred to a\r\nfew pages back. When her wireless messages of distress were received\r\na score of vessels went groping in the fog to her assistance, while\r\nthe entire civilized world waited in breathless expectancy. Most\r\nof the rescuing vessels, although constantly in communication with\r\nthe stricken ship, were unable to locate her. But the successful\r\nvessel finally got in touch with the _Republic's_ submarine signaling\r\napparatus, and aided by this located the vessel and rescued the crew\r\nand passengers.\r\n\r\nThis is only one instance of the practical application of the submarine\r\nsignaling apparatus. But its use is not confined to the larger boats.\r\nThe apparatus can be made so small that even boats the size of a\r\nfishing dory may be equipped at least with the sounding device, and\r\nthus protected.\r\n\r\nOn the Newfoundland fishing banks one of the chief causes of loss of\r\nlife is the running down of the fishing boats in the fog by passing\r\nsteamers, and also the loss of the dories of the fishermen who are\r\nunable to find their way back to their vessels. Many of these fishing\r\nvessels now supply each of the attending dories with a submarine bell\r\nwhich weighs about forty pounds and is run by clockwork. When caught\r\nin the fog the fisherman hangs this bell over the side of his dory and\r\nthus warns approaching steamers of his position, at the same time\r\naffording his own vessel a guide for finding him and picking him up. In\r\nthis manner the appalling loss of life in the fogs on the fishing banks\r\nhas been greatly lessened. Thus the submarine signaling device gives\r\naid to the smaller craft as well as the larger vessels.\r\n\r\nFor the moment this is the last important safety device that has been\r\ninvented to help lessen the perils of sea voyages. Indeed the perils\r\nand discomforts of ocean voyages are now largely reminiscent, thanks\r\nto the rapid succession of scientific discoveries and their practical\r\napplication during the last half century. The size of modern vessels\r\nminimizes rolling and pitching. Turbine engines practically eliminate\r\nengine vibrations. The danger from fires was practically eliminated by\r\nthe introduction of iron and steel as building material; the danger of\r\nsinking after collisions is now guarded against by the division of the\r\nship's hull into water-tight compartments; sensitive instruments as\r\nused at present warn the mariner of the presence of ice-bergs; wireless\r\ntelegraphy affords a means of calling aid in case of disabled machinery\r\nand giving the ship's location in a general way; while the submarine\r\nsignal makes known the exact location of the stricken vessel in foggy\r\nweather.\r\n\r\nIn a trifle over half a century the time of crossing the Atlantic has\r\nbeen reduced by more than one-half. In 1856 the _Persia_ crossed the\r\nocean between Queenstown and New York in nine days, one hour, and\r\nforty-five minutes, making a new record. In 1909 the _Mauretania_\r\ncovered the same distance in four days, ten hours, and fifty-one\r\nminutes. In March, 1910, the same vessel completed a passage over\r\nthe longer winter course, a distance of 2,889 knots, in four days,\r\nfifteen hours, and twenty-nine minutes, reducing the previous record by\r\ntwenty-nine minutes.\r\n\r\nWhen the _Lusitania_ and _Mauretania_ were completed many short-sighted\r\npersons predicted that these vessels would never be surpassed in size\r\nor speed. As if to refute such predictions, however, the White Star\r\nCompany at once began constructing two vessels, the _Olympic_ and\r\n_Titanic_, each with a displacement of one-fourth more than the great\r\nCunarders, and of overshadowing proportions in everything save the\r\nmatter of speed. Against the _Mauretania's_ average twenty-six knot\r\nspeed the new boats are designed to make only twenty-one.\r\n\r\nThese new boats are eight hundred and ninety feet in length, as against\r\nthe _Lusitania's_ seven hundred and ninety. They are ninety-two feet in\r\nbeam, and sixty-two feet in molded depth. The roof of the pilot house\r\nis seventy feet above the water. The maximum draft is thirty-seven and\r\na half feet and the displacement sixty thousand tons.\r\n\r\nThey resemble the _Great Eastern_ in that they have two systems\r\nof engines. Two reciprocating engines drive the two outer of the\r\nthree screws, and the exhaust from these engines is utilized in a\r\nlow-pressure turbine engine, driving the center propeller.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIQUID FUEL\r\n\r\nAnother step that has been taken to increase the efficiency of the\r\nsteam engine on ships, is the adoption of liquid fuel in place of coal\r\nfor making steam. For years the advantages of this form of fuel have\r\nbeen recognized, the Russians having brought its use to a high state of\r\nperfection, both in boats and locomotives. Practically all the steamers\r\non the Black and Caspian seas, as well as on such rivers as the Volga,\r\nburn oil exclusively. And early in 1910 the British Navy decided to\r\nsubstitute oil for coal on all its vessels.\r\n\r\nThe advantages claimed for oil over coal as fuel are many. It is\r\nsmokeless, produces more heat than coal, occupies less space for\r\nstorage, can be loaded more quickly and easily, is cleaner, and reduces\r\nthe engine-room force to one-fourth or one-third the number of men\r\nrequired when coal is used. Incidentally it reduces the difficult\r\nphysical task of stoking to one relatively pleasant and easy. It\r\ngives a steadier fire, does not foul the boilers, and does away with\r\ncumbersome ashes and clinkers.\r\n\r\nIts disadvantage lies in the danger from fire. An inflammable\r\nliquid carried in a ship's hold is obviously more dangerous than a\r\ncorresponding quantity of relatively incombustible coal. Yet the\r\nobvious advantages of this form of fuel have been so compelling that it\r\nis now coming into use on all classes of war vessels, and seems likely\r\nto supplant coal entirely on some types of boats, such as the torpedo\r\ndestroyers. Moreover, the experience of the Russian boats on the Black\r\nand Caspian seas seems to indicate that the dangers from the use of\r\noil as a fuel when properly handled have been greatly exaggerated,\r\nand passenger and freight steamers all over the world are gradually\r\nadopting it.\r\n\r\nSome tests were made by the Navy Department of the United States in\r\n1909-1910 using a vessel which was formerly a coal-burning boat.\r\nIn these tests it was found that the steaming radius was greatly\r\nincreased, the firing force reduced, and fuel taken into the ship in\r\nabout one-fourth the time it takes to coal. It was possible to get up\r\nsteam in any boiler, or set of boilers, much more quickly than with\r\ncoal.\r\n\r\nOf course where oil is used for fuel some special form of burner is\r\nnecessary. Many types have been tried, but in the most effective the\r\noil is atomized by the use of steam spray, or air blast, it being\r\nimpossible to get proper combustion of the oil except when used in\r\nminutely divided particles. Used in this manner a uniform temperature\r\ncan be maintained easily, or may be increased or decreased very quickly.\r\n\r\nAs used at present liquid fuel simply substitutes coal for heating the\r\nordinary type of boiler. But there seems every reason to believe that\r\nin the near future some type of internal combustion engine will be\r\nperfected that will use the crude, cheap oil, as the finer and lighter\r\noils are used in motors to-day. When this occurs the space-consuming\r\nboilers and furnaces used in ships at present will be replaced by\r\ncompact machinery, quite as efficient, but occupying only a fraction of\r\nthe space. Nor need we expect that the invention of some such type of\r\nengine will be long delayed, if we may judge by the rapid strides made\r\nin perfecting other internal combustion engines during the past few\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nSUBMARINE VESSELS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe development of submarine vessels has been one of the slowest in\r\nthe history of modern inventions. Submarine boats, using submarine\r\ntorpedoes, were able to destroy ships a hundred years ago; and a little\r\nless than half a century ago naval vessels were destroyed in actual\r\nwarfare by these boats. But curiously enough no vessel has ever been\r\ndestroyed in actual warfare by a submarine boat since that time. Yet\r\nthese boats are essentially war-vessels, and, with the exception of\r\nboats of the Lake type, of no use whatever for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the explanation for this tardy development lies in the fact\r\nthat until recent years naval men have not looked with favor upon this\r\nstyle of fighting craft. In Admiral Porter's book, written in 1878,\r\nhe makes the statement that one of the reasons why they did not show\r\nmore enthusiasm about the submarine made by Robert Fulton early in\r\nthe nineteenth century, was that such boats \"menaced the position of\r\nthe naval men, whose calling would be gone did the little submarine\r\nboat supplant the battle-ship.\" We need not, however, depend upon\r\nthis statement, made as it was three-quarters of a century after the\r\ndemonstrations by Fulton, for there are many similar statements made\r\nat the time to be had at first hand. Thus Admiral Earl St. Vincent,\r\nwhen opposing the views of William Pitt, who had become enthusiastic\r\nover the possibilities of Fulton's submarines, is on record as having\r\nopposed such craft on the ground that by encouraging such development\r\n\"he was laying the foundation which would do away with the navy.\" In\r\n1802, M. St. Aubin wrote in this connection, \"What will become of the\r\nnavies, and where will sailors be found to man ships of war, when it is\r\na physical certainty that they may at any time be blown into the air by\r\ndiving boats, against which no human foresight can guard them?\"\r\n\r\nSuch opposition has undoubtedly tended to retard the progress of\r\nsubmarine navigation; but be the cause what it may, it has made slow\r\nand laborious work of it; and we are only now approaching a solution\r\nof the question that seemed almost within grasp a hundred years\r\nago--before the days of steam or electricity.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST SUBMARINE\r\n\r\nAs early as the sixteenth century the possibilities of submarine\r\nnavigation was the dream of the mariner, and tentative attempts at\r\nsubmarine boats are said to have been made even at an earlier period\r\nthan this; but the first practical submarine boat capable of navigation\r\nentirely submerged for any length of time was made by David Bushnell,\r\nof Westbrook (then Saybrook), Maine, U. S. A., in 1775. Details as to\r\nthe construction of the remarkable craft, are recorded in a letter\r\nwritten by the inventor to Thomas Jefferson in 1789, and recorded\r\nin the _Transactions of the American Philosophical Society_. In this\r\nletter Bushnell says:--\r\n\r\n\"The external shape of the submarine vessel bore some resemblance to\r\nthe upper tortoise shells of equal size, joined together, the place\r\nof entrance into the vessel being represented by the opening made by\r\nthe swell of the shells at the head of the animal. The inside was\r\ncapable of containing the operator and air sufficient to support him\r\nthirty minutes without receiving fresh air. At the bottom, opposite to\r\nthe entrance, was fixed a quantity of lead for ballast. At one edge,\r\nwhich was directly before the operator, who sat upright, was an oar\r\nfor rowing forward and backward. At the other edge was a rudder for\r\nsteering. An aperture at the bottom, with its valves, was designed to\r\nadmit water for the purpose of descending, and two brass forcing-pumps\r\nserved to eject the water within when necessary for ascending. At\r\nthe top there was likewise an oar for ascending or descending, or\r\ncontinuing at any particular depth. A water-gauge or barometer\r\ndetermined the depth of descent, a compass directed the course, and\r\na ventilator within supplied the vessel with fresh air when on the\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\n\"The vessel was chiefly ballasted with lead fixed to its bottom; when\r\nthis was not sufficient a quantity was placed within, more or less\r\naccording to the weight of the operator; its ballast made it so stiff\r\nthat there was no danger of oversetting. The vessel, with all its\r\nappendages and the operator, was of sufficient weight to settle it very\r\nlow in the water. About two hundred pounds of lead at the bottom for\r\nballast could be let down forty or fifty feet below the vessel; this\r\nenabled the operator to rise instantly to the surface of the water in\r\ncase of accident.\r\n\r\n\"When the operator would descend, he placed his foot upon the top of a\r\nbrass valve, depressing it, by which he opened a large aperture in the\r\nbottom of the vessel, through which the water entered at his pleasure;\r\nwhen he had admitted a sufficient quantity he descended very gradually;\r\nif he admitted too much he ejected as much as was necessary to obtain\r\nan equilibrium by the two brass forcing-pumps which were placed at each\r\nhand. Whenever the vessel leaked, or he would ascend to the surface, he\r\nalso made use of these forcing-pumps. When the skillful operator had\r\nobtained an equilibrium he would row upward or downward, or continue at\r\nany particular depth, with an oar placed near the top of the vessel,\r\nformed upon the principle of the screw, the axis of the oar entering\r\nthe vessel; by turning the oar one way he raised the vessel, by turning\r\nit the other he depressed it.\r\n\r\n\"An oar, formed upon the principle of a screw, was fixed in the fore\r\npart of the vessel; its axis entered the vessel, and being turned one\r\nway, rowed the vessel forward, but being turned the other way rowed it\r\nbackward; it was made to be turned by the hand or foot.\r\n\r\n\"Behind the submarine vessel was a place above the rudder for carrying\r\na large powder magazine. This was made of two pieces of oak timber,\r\nlarge enough when hollowed out to contain one hundred and fifty pounds\r\nof powder, with the apparatus used in firing it, and was secured in\r\nits place by a screw turned by the operator. A strong piece of rope\r\nextended from the magazine to the wood screw above mentioned, and was\r\nfastened to both. When the wood screw was fixed to be cast off from\r\nits tube, the magazine was to be cast off likewise by unscrewing it,\r\nleaving it hanging to the wood screw; it was lighter than the water,\r\nthat it might rise up against the object to which the wood screw and\r\nitself were fastened.\r\n\r\n\"Within the magazine was an apparatus constructed to run any proposed\r\nlength of time under twelve hours; when it had run its time it\r\nunpinioned a strong lock resembling a gun-lock, which gave fire to the\r\npowder. This apparatus was so pinioned that it could not possibly move\r\ntill, by casting off the magazine from the vessel, it was set in motion.\r\n\r\n\"The skillful operator could swim so low on the surface of the water\r\nas to approach very near a ship in the night without fear of being\r\ndiscovered, and might, if he chose, approach the stem or stem above the\r\nwater with very little danger. He could sink very quickly, keep at any\r\ndepth he pleased, and row a great distance in any direction he desired\r\nwithout coming to the surface, and when he rose to the surface he could\r\nsoon obtain a fresh supply of air. If necessary, he might descend again\r\nand pursue his course.\r\n\r\n\"After various attempts to find an operator to my wish, I sent one\r\nwho appeared more expert than the rest from New York to a fifty-gun\r\nship lying not far from Governor's Island. He went under the ship\r\nand attempted to fix the wooden screw in her bottom, but struck, as\r\nhe supposed, a bar of iron which passes from the rudder hinge, and\r\nis spiked under the ship's quarter. Had he moved a few inches, which\r\nhe might have done without rowing, I have no doubt but that he would\r\nhave found wood where he might have fixed the screw, or if the ship\r\nwere sheathed with copper he might easily have pierced it; but not\r\nbeing well skilled in the management of the vessel, in attempting to\r\nmove to another place he lost the ship. After seeking her in vain for\r\nsome time he rowed some distance and rose to the surface of the water,\r\nbut found daylight had advanced too far that he durst not renew the\r\nattempt. He says that he could easily have fastened the magazine under\r\nthe stem of the ship above the water, as he rowed up to the stern and\r\ntouched it before he descended. Had he fastened it there the explosion\r\nof one hundred and fifty pounds of powder (the quantity contained in\r\nthe magazine) must have been fatal to the ship. In his return from the\r\nship to New York he passed near Governor's Island, and thought he was\r\ndiscovered by the enemy on the island. Being in haste to avoid the\r\ndanger he feared, he cast off the magazine, as he imagined it retarded\r\nhim in the swell, which was very considerable. After the magazine had\r\nbeen cast off one hour, the time the infernal apparatus was set to run,\r\nit blew up with great violence.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROBERT FULTON.]\r\n\r\n\r\nROBERT FULTON'S EXPERIMENTS\r\n\r\nThe work begun by Bushnell in 1775 was taken up ten years later by\r\nRobert Fulton whose diving-boats so nearly fulfilled the conditions\r\nnecessary for practical submarine navigation. As America was at\r\npeace at this time, and as her financial condition was at the lowest\r\nebb, Fulton transferred his skill and energy to Europe which was\r\nthen involved in the Napoleonic wars. Several attempts were made to\r\ninterest the French government in his invention, but although certain\r\ncommissions reported favorably on his ideas, nothing came of them for\r\na time. In 1800, however, Fulton succeeded in interesting Napoleon in\r\nhis scheme, and the following year he was given the opportunity of\r\nbuilding his first submarine boat, the _Nautilus_. This boat was cigar\r\nshaped, about twenty-one feet long and seven feet in diameter, and made\r\nof copper supported by iron ribs. When operating at the surface this\r\nboat used a peculiarly shaped sail; but when submerged it was propelled\r\nby a screw actuated by machinery turned by hand. In this boat, Fulton,\r\nwith three companions, descended to a depth of twenty-three feet and\r\nremained submerged for twenty minutes; and at a depth of five or six\r\nfeet they are said to have remained submerged for six hours, air being\r\nsupplied by a copper vessel, probably containing oxygen or compressed\r\nair.\r\n\r\nThe first experiment made in attempting actually to destroy a vessel\r\nwith the _Nautilus_, was successful, a small vessel being sunk.\r\nEncouraged by this success Fulton proposed to build larger boats of\r\nthis same type capable of destroying the largest battle-ships. In\r\nreturn he asked that a reward be paid him for each vessel destroyed,\r\nthe price of his diving boat reimbursed, and a patent be given himself\r\nand the members of his crew, so that in case of capture they would\r\nbe treated as prisoners of war and not hanged as pirates. Strangely\r\nenough this latter clause was the greatest stumbling-block, as the\r\nproposed methods of destroying battle-ships by torpedoes was held in\r\nsuch disrepute that the French government would not grant a patent\r\nrating the crew of torpedo boats or submarine boats as legitimate\r\nbelligerents. In effect, their attitude was, that while a person was at\r\nliberty to destroy an empire from the surface of the water, he would be\r\nhanged as a criminal if he dived beneath the surface and destroyed a\r\nboat.\r\n\r\nDiscouraged by this stand of the French government, Fulton removed to\r\nEngland, where he succeeded in interesting the prime-minister, William\r\nPitt, in his novel boat. A commission was appointed consisting of a\r\nnumber of prominent men, including Mr. Pitt, and Fulton was requested\r\nto demonstrate what could be done in actual practice by his submarine.\r\nOn October 15, 1805, an old brig detailed for the purpose was destroyed\r\nby Fulton by the explosion of a torpedo containing one hundred\r\nand seventy pounds of powder. Yet in the face of this remarkable\r\ndemonstration the commission remained unfavorable to Fulton's scheme,\r\nalthough Mr. Pitt to the last retained his faith in the possibilities\r\nof such boats.\r\n\r\nRecognizing that further attempts in England would be fruitless,\r\nFulton returned to the United States. Here, in 1810, Congress became\r\nsufficiently interested to appropriate five thousand dollars to assist\r\nhim in his work, and as a final test of the boat he had built, the\r\nnaval authorities prepared the brig _Argus_ to resist an attack by\r\nthe submarine. This preparation consisted in surrounding her with\r\nprotecting booms of logs, supporting strong netting, and held a\r\ndistance from the hull by spars. In fact all possible means short of\r\nactually building a wall about the _Argus_ were taken to defeat the\r\nattack. It is probable that the brig, when her preparations for defense\r\nwere completed, would have been invulnerable even to a modern torpedo,\r\nand it is not surprising, therefore, that Fulton's attack upon her\r\nutterly failed.\r\n\r\nCommenting upon this failure and the means taken by the authorities to\r\nprotect the _Argus_, Fulton significantly remarked that the very fact\r\nthat a war vessel was obliged to make use of such means to protect\r\nherself against a system of attack then in its infancy, spoke volumes\r\nfor the possibilities of this method of attacking when it should be\r\nmore fully developed.\r\n\r\nBut although this failure to destroy the _Argus_ caused Congress to\r\nwithdraw its aid for future experiments in submarine warfare, Fulton\r\nhimself never lost faith in the importance of his work. Even after\r\nhis successful invention of the steamboat, for surface navigation, he\r\nis said to have remarked that, while this invention was important, it\r\ncould in no wise compare with the revolutionary effects upon navigation\r\nthat would eventually be produced by submarine boats. And despite his\r\nfailure to convince the government of the possibilities of his diving\r\nboats, he continued his experiments with them. How nearly he succeeded\r\nin making a practical submarine was shown in the second war with\r\nEngland that followed soon after.\r\n\r\nIn this war a \"diving boat,\" supposed to have been one of Fulton's\r\nsubmarines, made several attacks upon the British man-of-war\r\n_Ramillies_ off New London, in the summer of 1813. In the first two\r\nattempts the approach of the submarine was detected by the crew of\r\nthe man-of-war, who cut their cables, and stood out of the harbor as\r\nquickly as possible. In the third attempt, the diving boat succeeded in\r\ncoming up in a position directly under the _Ramillies_, fastened itself\r\nto the keel and made a hole in the planking large enough to receive the\r\nscrew which was to fasten the torpedo in place. In the act of fastening\r\nit, however, this screw was broken off, and the attempt had to be\r\nabandoned for the moment.\r\n\r\nThis attack created such a panic aboard the British boat, that she\r\ndid not return to the inner harbor but kept constantly in motion\r\noutside. Not satisfied with this protection against such \"dishonorable\r\nattempts,\" the British commander took on board his vessel a hundred\r\nprisoners, apprising the Americans of the fact, and assuring them that\r\na similar action would be taken by all the ships of the British fleet,\r\nso that in case a vessel was torpedoed the American prisoners would be\r\nblown up with her crew. This effectually frustrated Fulton's plans; for\r\nwhen the fact became known in the United States, the Americans were\r\nnaturally as vigorous as the British in protesting against Fulton and\r\nhis boats.\r\n\r\nObviously the rule that \"everything is fair in war\" was not accepted\r\nin practice a hundred years ago. Fulton's attempts were regarded as\r\nthe acts of a pirate, those of the British commander as perfectly\r\nlegitimate and honorable methods.\r\n\r\n\r\nA SUCCESSFUL DIVING BOAT\r\n\r\nFrom the time of Fulton to the outbreak of the American Civil War there\r\nwere few attempts at submarine navigation. On the opening of this war,\r\nhowever, efforts were made to perfect diving boats; and these efforts\r\nwere so well directed that eventually one of these boats succeeded in\r\ndestroying the Federal boat _Housatonic_ in Charleston Harbor on the\r\nnight of February 17, 1864.\r\n\r\nThe submarine that accomplished this was one of the most remarkable\r\nboats ever constructed. It was cigar shaped, about sixty feet long,\r\nand carried a crew of nine men. It was submerged partly by means of\r\nballast tanks and partly by lateral fins. As a weapon it carried a spar\r\ntorpedo fastened to its blunt nose. It was propelled by hand-power,\r\neight of the nine members of the crew working on a crank which actuated\r\nthe propeller. The ninth man, crouching in the bow, steered the boat.\r\nNo reserve air was carried, and consequently the length of time the\r\nboat could remain submerged was limited to a very few minutes. On\r\naccount of this, and because of its unfortunate career, it was aptly\r\ncalled the \"peripatetic coffin\"; and it justified this name by sinking\r\nfive different times, drowning thirty-five out of forty of the members\r\nof its different crews. Nevertheless it succeeded in destroying an\r\nAmerican war vessel, thus demonstrating that this feat is possible\r\nunder condition of actual warfare.\r\n\r\nThe submarines of the Civil War came to be known by the general name of\r\n\"Davids,\" and several of them of different types were built. The only\r\nsuccessful attack of any of these Davids, however, was the one which\r\ndestroyed the _Housatonic_. In his book, _The Naval History of the\r\nCivil War_, Admiral Porter described this attack upon the _Housatonic_\r\nas follows:--\r\n\r\n\"At about 8.45 P.M. the officer of the deck on board the unfortunate\r\nvessel discovered something about one hundred yards away, moving along\r\nthe water. It came directly toward the ship, and within two minutes of\r\nthe time it was first sighted was alongside. The cable was slipped,\r\nthe engines backed, and all hands called to quarters. But it was too\r\nlate--the torpedo struck the _Housatonic_ just forward of the mainmast,\r\non the starboard side, in a line with the magazine. The man who steered\r\nher knew where the vulnerable spots of the steamer were, and he did his\r\nwork well. When the explosion took place the ship trembled all over as\r\nif by the shock of an earthquake, and seemed to be lifted out of the\r\nwater, and then sunk foremost, heeling to port as she went down.\r\n\r\n\"Her captain, Pickering, was stunned and somewhat bruised by the\r\nconcussion, and the order of the day was 'Sauve qui peut.' A boat\r\nwas despatched to the _Canandaigua_, not far off, and that vessel at\r\nonce responded to the request for help, and succeeded in rescuing the\r\ngreater part of the crew.\r\n\r\n\"Strange to say the David was not seen after the explosion, and\r\nwas supposed to have slipped away in the confusion; but when the\r\n_Housatonic_ was inspected by divers, the torpedo-boat was found\r\nsticking in the hole she had made, and all her crew were dead in her.\r\nIt was a reckless adventure these men had engaged in, and one in\r\nwhich they could scarcely have hoped to succeed. They had tried it\r\nonce before inside the harbor, and some of the crew had been blown\r\noverboard. How could they hope to succeed on the outside, where the sea\r\nmight be rough, when the speed of the David was not over five knots,\r\nand when they might be driven out to sea! Reckless as it might be, it\r\nwas the most sublime patriotism, and showed the length to which men\r\ncould be urged on behalf of a cause for which they were willing to give\r\nup their lives and all they held most dear.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nRECENT SUBMARINES AND SUBMERSIBLES\r\n\r\nAfter the Civil War several nations interested themselves in the\r\nsubject of submarines, and during the Franco-Prussian war in 1870-71,\r\nFrance attempted the construction of such vessels, but without success.\r\nYet the possibility of producing these boats was becoming more apparent\r\nevery year by the improvements in electrical motors, gasoline engines,\r\ncompressed-air motors, and the automobile- or fish-torpedo--itself a\r\nminiature submarine boat.\r\n\r\nIn America the progress made in submarine-boat construction has been\r\nfully as great, if not greater, than in any other country. Undoubtedly\r\nthe foremost figure in this progress has been Mr. P. Holland; and his\r\nefforts and successes are largely responsible for the present fleet of\r\nsubmarine boats built already, or in the process of construction, as\r\nwell as for those of several foreign countries. Indeed, in the matter\r\nof submarine inventions, only one country can be considered as rivaling\r\nAmerica, that nation being France, whose enthusiasm for submarine\r\nnavigation has been much greater than that of any other nation,\r\nalthough in the matter of results she has not outstripped the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nMr. Holland's first submarine boat was built in 1875. It was called\r\na \"diving canoe,\" being only sixteen feet in length and wide enough\r\nto hold one man clothed in a diving-suit. Four years later, however,\r\nHolland built a larger boat called the _Holland No. 3_ constructed\r\nalong similar lines to the most recent submarines. This was the first\r\nbuoyant submarine to be steered up and down by horizontal rudders\r\nalone, and may be said to mark an epoch in submarine navigation. But\r\nthe No. 3 had many defects, and Mr. Holland continued to build and\r\nimprove new boats, until finally his ninth boat, which is the one\r\nfamiliarly known as the _Holland_, represented a practical form of\r\nsubmarine vessel. This boat was 53 feet 10 inches long, 10 feet 3\r\ninches in diameter, had a displacement of 75 tons, and carried 10 tons\r\nof water ballast. The gasoline engine which it used when running at the\r\nsurface propelled the boat at the rate of seven knots an hour, and it\r\ncould travel a distance of fifteen hundred miles at this rate of speed\r\nwith the amount of fuel carried. When submerged it could run a distance\r\nof about fifty knots without coming to the surface.\r\n\r\nIn diving, the Holland type of boat takes in sufficient water ballast\r\nto lower it to the surface of the water. The horizontal rudders are\r\nthen brought into use causing it to descend to the desired depth, and\r\nkeeping it at an approximately uniform distance from the surface while\r\nrunning submerged. By this arrangement the boat can dive very quickly,\r\nrequiring only a matter of eight or ten seconds for reaching a depth of\r\nthirty feet. Record plunges have been made in less time than this.\r\n\r\nThe armament of the Holland boat was originally designed to consist\r\nof three tubes, two of which were for throwing aërial torpedoes and\r\nshells, and the third for discharging Whitehead torpedoes. One of\r\nthese aërial guns was placed in the bow, and one in the stem; but\r\nlater the stern tube was abandoned. The bow gun was designed to\r\ndischarge projectiles a distance of about one mile, such projectiles\r\nweighing something over two hundred pounds and carrying one hundred\r\npounds of gun-cotton. The tube for discharging the Whitehead torpedo\r\nwas practically the same as the submerged tubes in use at present on\r\nbattle-ships.\r\n\r\nAlthough this _Holland_ is now the type of diving boat most familiar to\r\nthe majority of people, and the one in use in several navies, it should\r\nnot be understood that the Holland boats were the only successful\r\nsubmarines constructed up to this time. France and Russia had produced\r\nsuccessful diving boats; and in America those invented by Simon Lake,\r\nsome of which are used for wrecking and salvage work as well as for\r\nwar purposes, have proved quite as practical as the Hollands. In recent\r\ntests of these two types by the United States Government the Holland\r\nboats showed themselves to be slightly superior to the Lake boats in\r\ncertain particulars, but the margin of superiority was a very narrow\r\none.\r\n\r\nThe boats of the \"Octopus\" type are strictly speaking \"diving boats,\"\r\nwhile the Lake boats are of the \"even-keel\" type. These terms refer to\r\nthe method of submergence, the diving boats changing their horizontal\r\ntrim when submerging, while the even-keel boats retain their horizontal\r\ntrim, or nearly so.\r\n\r\nThe Lake boats have some features not usually embodied in other\r\nsubmarines, since some of the boats are designed for purposes other\r\nthan warfare. Thus, they are equipped with wheels, or buffers, on which\r\nthey can roll along the bottom of the ocean or bay. In the bow is an\r\nair-tight compartment with an opening in the bottom through which a\r\ndiver can emerge and work on wreckage, or laying and disconnecting\r\nmines. These boats have also a safety device in the form of a\r\ndetachable keel weighing several tons. In case of accident, when it\r\nmight otherwise be impossible to rise to the surface, this keel can be\r\ndetached simply by pulling a lever, thus giving the boat sufficient\r\nbuoyancy to rise to the surface. This particular feature of the\r\ndetachable keel is not peculiar to the Lake boats alone, some of the\r\nforeign submarines using a similar arrangement as a safeguard.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE AMERICAN SUB-MARINE BOAT \"CUTTLEFISH\" IN DRY DOCK AT\r\nTHE BROOKLYN NAVY YARD.]\r\n\r\nTechnically speaking the name \"submarine\" is now used only as applying\r\nto those boats that are operated solely by electric power, have\r\nlittle buoyancy, and do very little running at the surface. The term\r\n\"submersible\" is applied to a submarine boat, actuated by electricity\r\nwhile submerged, but using gasoline motors for motive power while\r\nrunning at the surface. These gasoline engines are used at the same\r\ntime for charging the storage batteries; so that the submersible is\r\na much more practical boat than the submarine, and at the same time\r\nis quite as good a diver. Indeed, although many naval writers are\r\nvery careful to make a distinction in the use of these terms, there\r\nseems little need of doing so, since only one type of boat--the\r\nsubmersible--is now considered practical. But as the word submarine\r\nis the older and more popular, it is used here to cover both classes\r\nexcept in specific cases.\r\n\r\nFor several years there were two classes of submarines under\r\nobservation--those possessing no floatability when submerged, and\r\nthose having some reserve buoyancy. The advantage claimed for the\r\nno-floatability class of boats is that, having no buoyancy, they are\r\nkept more easily at a certain depth below the surface of the water\r\ninstead of tending to come to the surface constantly as in the case of\r\nboats of the other type.\r\n\r\nBut in actual practice the theoretical possibilities of such boats have\r\nnot come up to the expectations of their advocates. For keeping the\r\nboat at a uniform depth, the most universally accepted method is by\r\nthe use of horizontal rudders. The fact that the vertical direction of\r\na boat may be controlled by horizontal rudders, when her buoyancy is\r\nsmall, has long since been established in submarine navigation; and\r\nthe simplicity of this method naturally helps its popularity. If there\r\nwere no shifting of weight in a submarine, or no wave disturbance,\r\nit would not be difficult to set the rudders at such an angle that\r\nthe boat would travel for long distances at an approximately uniform\r\nsubmergence, the depth of submergence being indicated by gauges acted\r\nupon by the water pressure on the surface of the boat. And in actual\r\npractice it is possible to do this at the present time, part of the\r\nproblem having been solved by automatic and other devices.\r\n\r\nIt should be remembered that many things enter into the disturbance of\r\nthe submarine's equilibrium. The movement of a member of the crew from\r\none point to another shifts the ballast; a certain amount of leakage of\r\nwater cannot be avoided, and the sudden discharge of a torpedo weighing\r\nseveral hundred pounds from her bow tends to bring the boat quickly\r\nto the surface if this lost weight is not compensated for quickly. By\r\nvarious ingenious devices all these difficulties have been practically\r\novercome, most of them automatically.\r\n\r\nBut the great unsolved problem of submarine navigation--practically\r\nthe only one that now opposes a question mark to its great utility\r\nin warfare--is that of steering with certainty of direction when\r\nsubmerged. Once the submarine is under water it is in utter darkness as\r\nfar as seeing to steer is concerned; and what adds to the difficulty\r\nis the fact that the compass cannot be relied upon, because of the\r\nsurrounding electrical apparatus. It would be possible, perhaps, to\r\nconstruct a powerful electric lamp to throw a light some distance\r\nahead of the boat, but this would defeat the primary object of\r\nsubmarine attack, as such a light would be seen by an enemy.\r\n\r\nIn still water, when the boat is running within a distance of ten\r\nor fifteen feet of the surface, it is possible to steer with great\r\nprecision by the use of an optical tube or \"periscope.\" This periscope\r\nis a straight, hollow tube, connected with the steering compartment\r\nin the submarine, and protruding above the water. In the upper end\r\nare a mirror and lenses so arranged that the surrounding objects are\r\nreflected downward through the tube, and show on a screen, or some\r\nother device, so that the helmsman sees things of exactly the same size\r\nthat they would appear to the naked eye. The periscope is also fitted\r\nwith a telescope attachment which magnifies objects like the binoculars\r\nused in surface navigation. On some recent submarines there are two\r\nperiscopes, a movable one for use of the commanding officer, and one\r\nthat looks straight ahead for the helmsman's use.\r\n\r\nIn still water the periscope works admirably, but it is seriously\r\ninterfered with even by small waves. It is so small and inconspicuous,\r\nhowever, that it might enable a submarine to creep within torpedo range\r\neven in daylight, and launch the torpedo with accuracy, as was proved\r\nin 1908 when a fleet of submarines actually accomplished this feat in\r\nan experimental test.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESENT STATUS OF SUBMARINE BOATS\r\n\r\nTo most people, one of the most surprising things in the Russo-Japanese\r\nwar was the fact that submarine boats played no part in it whatever.\r\nThere is only one possible conclusion to be drawn from this: the day of\r\nthe submarine as a determining factor in naval battles on the high seas\r\nhad not arrived.\r\n\r\nThe reason for the surprise of the generality of people in finding the\r\nsubmarine was not as yet an entirely practical war engine, is due to\r\nthe enthusiastic misrepresentations of the daily press and magazines,\r\nwhose readers have been led to infer that the modern submarine boat\r\nis so far perfected that it can do things under water almost as well\r\nas boats on the surface. Nothing is farther from the truth. Under\r\nideal (and consequently unusual) conditions, the submarines, and\r\nsubmersibles, have done, and can do, some remarkable things, such as\r\nstaying submerged for hours, diving to a depth of two hundred feet, and\r\nrunning long distances. But these are only the first requisites of the\r\nunder-water fighting boat--simply the \"creeping stage\" of development.\r\nThe common impression that the submarine boat, such as the ones of the\r\nHolland and Lake types, can go cruising about, fish-like, for hours,\r\nwatching for its prey in some mysterious manner without coming near the\r\nsurface, is a dream not yet realized.\r\n\r\nIf one will pause to consider that light is necessary to sight and that\r\none hundred feet of sea water makes almost as efficient an obstacle to\r\nvision as a stone wall, it will be easy to understand why the submarine\r\nis still struggling with difficulties that oppose its perfection. The\r\nfanciful illustration seen so often of a submarine diving hundreds of\r\nfeet deep in the water, swimming about and finally coming up under the\r\nkeel of a battle ship and destroying it, are as yet the creations of\r\nvivid imaginations. For submarine marksmen, like all others, require\r\na fairly clear view of the target--even such a huge target as a\r\nbattle-ship--to direct their shots with any degree of certainty.\r\n\r\nThe greatest problem now confronting the submarine navigator,\r\ntherefore, is that of seeing without being seen. At night, and at long\r\nranges, this is not difficult, as the little conning-tower, or tiny\r\nperiscope tube protruding above the waves, is not easily detected\r\neven by strong searchlights, sharp eyes, and marine glasses. But long\r\nranges are of little use to the submarine; and there is always another\r\ndifficulty--the leviathan battle-ship does not lie still waiting to be\r\nstabbed by its sword-fish enemy, but keeps moving about, twisting and\r\nturning, at a rate of from fourteen to eighteen knots an hour, while\r\nthe submarine can only make about eleven knots when submerged. In a\r\nstern chase, therefore, the submarine is one of the most harmless of\r\nsea-monsters, in the open ocean. For harbor work, however, the case is\r\ndifferent. In some recent tests the submarine boats made eighty per\r\ncent. in hits while attacking moving vessels in a harbor at night--a\r\nfar higher percentage than is usually made by surface torpedo boats\r\nunder the same circumstances.\r\n\r\nAt present the best solution of the problem of steering the partly\r\nsubmerged submarine is offered by the use of a conning-tower elevated\r\nfive or six feet above the body of the submarine, which can be kept\r\njust above the waves, and present an inconspicuous target. The early\r\nHolland boats did not have this, although the American Lake boats have\r\nhad it from the first; but at the present time all boats are being so\r\nmade. At first these towers were made circular in form; but it was\r\nfound that towers of this shape made sufficient splash in passing\r\nthrough the water to attract attention at a considerable distance on a\r\nstill night. This shape was abandoned, therefore, and a boat-shaped one\r\nadopted.\r\n\r\nWith such a noiseless conning-tower the submersible can cruise about\r\non foggy nights, or when the waves are just high enough to make a\r\ndisturbance on the surface, running with the top of the conning-tower\r\nopen so as to secure good ventilation as long as possible, until the\r\nenemy is nearly within striking distance. As the target is approached\r\nthe conning-tower must be closed, the protruding top sunk lower and\r\nlower in the water, and finally completely submerged, nothing appearing\r\nat the surface but the periscope tube just above the waves. With the\r\naid of this instrument the target may still be seen distinctly, but the\r\narc of vision is limited, and guessing the distance or rate of speed of\r\nthe target is very difficult. Nevertheless, by estimating the distance\r\nbefore submerging, and knowing the rate of speed of his little craft,\r\nthe submarine gunner may still get his range and find his target.\r\nIf the waves are at all high, this is very difficult, as the water,\r\nslopping over the periscope, obscures the vision for several seconds at\r\na time and is very distracting. But some experiments carried on during\r\nthe summer of 1908 show that, even in broad daylight, it is no easy\r\nmatter for a battle-ship to detect the approach of submarines until\r\nwell within torpedo range, even when an attack is expected.\r\n\r\nIn these experiments the United States cruiser \"Yankee\" in Buzzard's\r\nBay was attacked by five submarines of the most recent type. The\r\n\"Yankee\" remained stationary expecting the attack, but to offset this\r\ndisadvantage the crew was fully aware of the exact time that the attack\r\nwas to be made. Indeed the officers of the cruiser had watched the\r\nsubmarines steam away until they disappeared. When twenty miles from\r\nthe \"Yankee\" the five submarines submerged and headed for the cruiser,\r\nmaking observations at intervals by means of the periscope.\r\n\r\nThe day was perfectly clear, and all on board the \"Yankee\" were keenly\r\nwatching for the expected submarines. Yet the first intimation they had\r\nof the proximity of the diving boats was the striking of five torpedoes\r\nagainst the cruiser's hull. Each submarine had scored a bull's-eye.\r\nNot content with this success, the submarines repeated the attack from\r\na nearer point, again scoring five hits before their presence was\r\ndetected.\r\n\r\nOne great obstacle to successful submarine navigation on an extended\r\nscale is the difficulty of keeping a supply of air not only for the use\r\nof the crew, but for the engines. Any really powerful engine, either\r\nsteam or gas, consumes an enormous amount of air. This is not true, of\r\ncourse, of the storage batteries which furnish the power for running\r\nwhile submerged, but these, at best, are but feeble generators of\r\nenergy, although Edison's recent improvements may materially improve\r\ntheir power. If gasoline engines could be used during submergence a\r\nfar greater speed would be acquired; but this is out of the question,\r\nas such engines would consume the air supply of the little boat far too\r\nrapidly. The compromise, now adopted universally, is to use gasoline\r\nmotors while running at the surface or partly submerged, when the\r\nconning-tower is open, utilizing part of their energy meanwhile to\r\ncharge the storage batteries.\r\n\r\nIt is evident, therefore, that no great speed can be expected of the\r\nsubmarine in its present state; and in point of fact the largest type\r\nis able to develop only about ten or eleven knots when submerged, and\r\nfifteen while at the surface--far below the speed of any other type\r\nof war vessel. But the experimental attacks upon the \"Yankee\" prove\r\nthat they are dangerous fighting craft, and a recent voyage by a\r\nflotilla of Italian submersibles shows that such boats are no longer\r\nharbor-locked vessels. In 1908 the Italian flotilla in question made\r\na voyage from Venice to Spezia, a distance of thirteen hundred miles,\r\nwithout assistance from auxiliary boats. About the same time a British\r\nsubmarine flotilla, on a three-hundred mile trip, remained submerged\r\nfor forty consecutive hours. The depth of the submergence in this case\r\nwas only a few feet, but great depths may be reached with relative\r\nsafety. In one test a Lake boat carrying her crew sank to a depth of\r\none hundred and thirty-eight feet, returning to the surface in a few\r\nminutes. At another time the \"Octopus,\" without her crew, was lowered\r\nto a depth of two hundred and five feet, sustaining a pressure of\r\nfifteen thousand tons, without injury.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A FLEET OF BRITISH SUB-MARINES MANŒUVERING AT THE\r\nSURFACE.]\r\n\r\nSuch performances as these are thought-provocative, to say the least.\r\nSubmarine boats that can hit the target without being detected, go on\r\ncruises unattended for more than a thousand miles, and remain submerged\r\nfor more than a day and a half, must be classed as efficient engines of\r\nwarfare.\r\n\r\nSince the submersible is designed to spend most of its time on the\r\nsurface of the water like an ordinary boat, it must have considerable\r\nbuoyancy, but it must also have some means of getting rid of this\r\nbuoyancy quickly when submergence is necessary. The submarine proper\r\nhas only from five to eight per cent. buoyancy, while some of the\r\nsubmersibles have twenty-five per cent. or more. With such boats of\r\nthe ordinary size some fifty tons of water must be admitted before\r\nbringing them to a condition in which they can be submerged; but this\r\ncan be done very quickly. One of the submarines of the U. S. fleet in\r\nan actual test filled her ballast tanks and dived to a depth of twenty\r\nfeet in four minutes and twenty seconds.\r\n\r\nIt is not impossible that the recent triumphs in aërial navigation may\r\nhave an important bearing on the use of submarines in future wars. It\r\nis well known that large objects when submerged even to a considerable\r\ndepth are discernible from a height in the air directly above them.\r\nIt is quite possible, therefore, that swift aeroplanes circling about\r\na fleet of war vessels might be able to detect submarine boats when\r\nthese boats were near enough the surface to use their periscopes. If\r\nso it might be possible for the aeroplanes to drop torpedoes upon the\r\nsubmerged boats without danger to themselves. Or if the aeroplanes\r\ncarried no effective weapons, they could at least act in the capacity\r\nof scouts and warn their battleship consorts of the presence of the\r\nsubmarine. Of course, this would be possible only in daylight, the\r\nairships giving no protection against night attacks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nTHE STEAM LOCOMOTIVE\r\n\r\n\r\nModern railroads are the outcome of the invention of the locomotive;\r\nyet the invention of the practical locomotive was the outcome of iron\r\nrailroads which had been in existence for half a century. These iron\r\nrailroads were a development from wooden predecessors, which were the\r\ndirect descendants of the smooth roadways of the Greeks and Romans.\r\nIndeed it is quite reasonable to suppose that the ancients may have\r\nbeen familiar with the use of parallel rails with grooved or flanged\r\nwheels to fit them; but if so there seems to be no definite record of\r\nthe fact, and our knowledge of true railroads goes back only to the\r\nseventeenth century.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1630, it is recorded that a road built of parallel rails of\r\nwood upon which cars were run was used in a coal-mine near Newcastle,\r\nEngland; and there is no reason to suppose that this road was a novelty\r\nat the time. Half a century later there was a railroad in operation\r\nnear the river Tyne which has been described by Roger North as being\r\nmade of \"rails of timber placed end to end and exactly straight, and in\r\ntwo parallel lines to each other. On these rails bulky cars were made\r\nto run on four rollers fitting the rails, whereby the carriage was\r\nmade so easy that one horse would draw four or five chaldrons of coal\r\nto a load.\"\r\n\r\nAt this time the use of iron rails had not been thought of, or at least\r\nhad not been tried, probably from the fact that iron was then very\r\nexpensive. Even the wooden rails in use, and the wheels that ran upon\r\nthem, were of no fixed pattern. Some of these rails were in the form\r\nof depressed grooves into which an ordinary wheel fitted. But these\r\nwere very unsatisfactory because they became filled so easily with dirt\r\nand other obstructions, and a more common type was a rail raised a few\r\ninches above the ground like a molding, a grooved wheel running on the\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nSuch rails were short lived, splitting and wearing away quickly, and\r\nbeing easily injured by other vehicles. But they were, on the whole,\r\nmore satisfactory than the depressed rails, and were the type adopted\r\nwhen iron rails first came into use, about 1767. Ten years later the\r\nidea of the single flange was conceived, not placed on the wheels of\r\nthe cars as at present, but cast on the rails themselves. These flanges\r\nwere first made on the outside of the rails, and later placed on the\r\ninside, the wheels of the cars used on such rails being of the ordinary\r\npattern with flat tires.\r\n\r\nBut, in 1789, William Jessop, of Leicestershire, began building cars\r\nwith wheels having single flanges on the inside like modern car wheels,\r\nto run upon an elevated molding-shaped iron rail; and the many points\r\nof superiority of this type of wheel soon led to its general adoption.\r\nSo that aside from some minor changes, the type of rails and wheels in\r\nuse at the close of the eighteenth century was practically the same as\r\nat present.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that if the first inventors had attempted to make\r\nlocomotives to run upon the railroads then in existence they would have\r\nbeen successful many years before they were, but the advantages of\r\nrailroads was not as evident then as now, and the inventors' efforts\r\nwere confined to attempts to produce locomotive wagons--automobiles--to\r\noperate upon any road where horses and carts could be used.\r\n\r\nSome of their creations were of the most fanciful and impractical\r\ndesign, although quite a number of them were \"locomotives\" in the sense\r\nthat they could be propelled over the ground by their own energy, but\r\nonly at a snail's pace, and by the expenditure of a great amount of\r\npower. Several inventors tried combining the principle of the steamboat\r\nand the locomotive in the same vehicle, and in 1803 a Philadelphian by\r\nthe name of Evans made a steam dredge and land-wagon combined which\r\nwas fairly successful in both capacities of boat and wagon. He called\r\nhis machine the \"Oruktor Amphibious,\" and upon one occasion made a\r\ntrip through the streets of Philadelphia, and then plunged into the\r\nSchuylkill River and continued his journey on the water. But as he was\r\nunable to arouse anything but curiosity, the financiers refusing to\r\ntake his machine seriously, he finally gave up his attempts to solve\r\nthe problem of steam locomotion.\r\n\r\nThe year before this, in 1802, Richard Trevithick, in England, had\r\nbeen more successful in his attempts at producing a locomotive. He\r\nproduced a steam locomotive that operated on the streets of London\r\nand the public highways, hauling a wagonload of people. But the\r\nunevenness of the roads proved disastrous to his engine, and as it\r\ncould make no better time than a slow horse, it was soon abandoned. But\r\nTrevithick had learned from this failure that a good roadbed was quite\r\nas essential to the success of a locomotive as the machine itself,\r\nand two years later he produced what is usually regarded as the first\r\nrailway locomotive. This was built for the Merthyr-Tydvil Railway in\r\nSouth Wales, and on several occasions hauled loads of ten tons of iron\r\nat a fair rate of speed. It was not considered a success financially,\r\nhowever, and was finally abandoned.\r\n\r\nAt this time a curious belief had become current among the inventors\r\nto the effect that if a smooth-surface rail and a smooth-surface wheel\r\nwere used, there would not be sufficient friction between the two to\r\nmake it possible to haul loads, or more than barely move the locomotive\r\nitself. Learned mathematicians proved conclusively on paper by endless\r\nhair-splitting calculations that the thing was impossible,--that\r\nany locomotive strong enough to propel itself along a smooth iron\r\nrail would be heavy enough to break the strongest rail, and smash\r\nthe roadbed. In the face of these arguments the idea of smooth rails\r\nand smooth wheels was abandoned for the time. Trevithick himself was\r\nconvinced, and turned his attention to the perfecting of an engine\r\nwith toothed drive-wheels running on a track with rack-rails. But this\r\nengine soon jolted itself and its track into the junk-heap without\r\ndoing anything to solve the problem of locomotion.\r\n\r\nShortly after this, a man named Chapman, of Newcastle, built a road and\r\nstretched a chain from one end to the other, this chain being arranged\r\nto pass around a barrel-wheel on the locomotive, which thus pulled\r\nitself along, just as some of the boats on the Rhine do at the present\r\ntime. But the machinery for operating this engine was clumsy and\r\nunsatisfactory, and the road proved a complete failure.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most remarkable locomotive ever conceived and constructed\r\nwas one built by Brunton, of Derbyshire, in 1813. This machine was\r\ndesigned to go upon legs like a horse, and was a combination of steam\r\nwagon and mechanical horse. The wagon part of the combination ran upon\r\na track like an ordinary car, while the mechanical legs were designed\r\nto trot behind and \"kick the wagon along.\" \"The legs or propellers,\r\nimitated the legs of a man or the fore-legs of a horse, with joints,\r\nand when worked by the machine alternately lifted and pressed against\r\nthe ground or road, propelling the engine forward, as a man shoves a\r\nboat ahead by pressing with a pole against the bottom of a river.\" This\r\nmachine was able to travel at a rate somewhat slower than that at which\r\na man usually walks; and its tractive force was that of four horses.\r\nBut after it had demonstrated its impotency by crawling along for a few\r\nmiles, it terminated its career by \"blowing up in disgust,\" killing and\r\ninjuring several by-standers.\r\n\r\nThe much disputed point as to whether a smooth-wheeled locomotive would\r\nbe practical on smooth rails was not settled until 1813. An inventor\r\nnamed Blackett, of Wylam, who with his engineer, William Hedley, had\r\nbuilt several steam locomotives which only managed to crawl along the\r\ntracks under the most favorable conditions, wishing to determine if it\r\nwere the fault of locomotives or the system on which they worked that\r\naccounted for his failures, constructed a car which was propelled by\r\nsix men working levers geared to the wheels, like the modern hand-car.\r\n\r\nIn this way he determined that there was sufficient adhesion between\r\nsmooth rails and smooth wheels for locomotives to haul heavy loads\r\nbehind them, even on grades of considerable incline. The experiments of\r\nBlackett settled this question beyond the possibility of controversy,\r\nand removed a very important obstacle from the path of future\r\ninventors. Among these inventors was young George Stephenson, who was\r\nrapidly making a reputation for himself as a practical engineer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GEORGE STEPHENSON]\r\n\r\n\r\nSTEPHENSON SOLVES THE PROBLEM\r\n\r\nStephenson was born on June 9, 1781, in the small colliery village\r\nof Wylam, on the river Tyne. His parents were extremely poor, and\r\nas the boy was sent to work as soon as he was large enough to find\r\nemployment of any kind, he was given no education, even to the extent\r\nof learning the alphabet. It was only after he had spent many years\r\nin the colliery, and had finally worked himself up from the position\r\nof \"picker\" at three pence a day to that of fireman, that he was able\r\nto spend the necessary time and pennies to acquire something of an\r\neducation. Then he attended a night school, learned his alphabet,\r\nwas able to scrawl his name at eighteen years of age, and a little\r\nlater could read, write, and do sums in arithmetic.\r\n\r\nBut if deficient in letters, there was one field in which he had no\r\nsuperior,--that was in the practical handling of a steam-engine.\r\nHis position in the mine gave him a chance to study the workings of\r\nthe engines then in use, and at every opportunity, on holidays and\r\nafter working-hours, he was in the habit of dismantling his engine,\r\nand carefully studying every detail of its construction. Thus by the\r\ntime he had reached his majority he was a skillful engineer, besides\r\nhaving many new ideas that had developed during his examinations\r\nof the machinery. But besides his knowledge of engineering, he was\r\nan accomplished workman in other fields. He was a good shoemaker,\r\nwatch-and clock-repairer, and tailors' cutter, at all of which trades\r\nhe worked at odd times to increase his income. Thus he was a veritable\r\njack-of-all-trades; with the unusual qualification, that he was master\r\nof _one_.\r\n\r\nBy the time he was twenty-six years old he was holding the position\r\nof engineer to a coal-mining company, and had acquired the confidence\r\nof his employers to such an extent that he was permitted to build a\r\nlocomotive for them--a thing that had been his ambition for several\r\nyears. This was in 1807, the same year that Robert Fulton demonstrated\r\nthe possibilities of steam navigation.\r\n\r\nIn the construction of this engine Stephenson introduced several novel\r\nfeatures of his own inventing, although on the whole no new principles\r\nwere involved; and in practice this engine showed several points\r\nof superiority over its predecessors. It would draw eight loaded\r\nwagons of thirty tons' weight at the rate of four miles an hour on\r\nan ascending grade of one in four hundred and fifty feet. But it had\r\ntwo very radical defects--it would not keep up steam and the noise of\r\nthe steam-pipe exhausting into the open air frightened the horses of\r\nthe neighborhood to such a degree that the authorities ordered the\r\ninventor either to stop running his engine, or suppress its noise. As\r\nan experiment, therefore, Stephenson arranged the exhaust pipes so that\r\nthey opened into the smokestack, where the sound would be muffled.\r\nBut when the engine was now tried he found to his surprise that this\r\nsingle expedient had solved both difficulties, the exhausting steam\r\ncausing such an improvement in the draught of his furnace that double\r\nthe quantity of steam was generated. This discovery helped to simplify\r\nlater experiments, for the difficulty of keeping up steam had been one\r\nof the great obstacles encountered by the inventors.\r\n\r\nStephenson's second locomotive was an improvement over his first in\r\nmany ways, but it was still far from being the practical machine that\r\nwas to supplant horse-power. It could haul heavier loads than teams of\r\nhorses, and was more convenient for certain purposes; but it was no\r\nmore economical.\r\n\r\nAs yet the only use to which locomotives had been put was that\r\nof hauling cars in coal-mines. Indeed, the only railroads then\r\nconstructed were those used in mines, the idea of utilizing such\r\nroads for passenger and freight traffic not having occurred to anyone\r\nuntil about 1820. Then the Englishman, Thomas Gray, suggested\r\nthe construction of such a road between Liverpool and Manchester,\r\nadvocating steam as the motive power. His idea was looked upon as\r\nvisionary, and as he persisted in his efforts to interest prominent\r\npeople in the scheme, he came to be very generally regarded as an\r\nenthusiastic but somewhat crackbrained fanatic.\r\n\r\nBut meanwhile the coal railroads were being extended to such lengths\r\nthat they were assuming the proportions of modern railroads. The\r\nmotive power on most of the roads was horses, although here and there\r\na traction engine using chain or cable, was employed for certain\r\npurposes. In 1825, however, Stephenson began the construction of an\r\nimproved locomotive, this time at his own modest establishment; and a\r\nlittle later this engine made the trial that really demonstrated the\r\npossibilities of steam locomotion, although this was not universally\r\nrecognized until the success of the _Rocket_ a few years later.\r\n\r\nA great deal of excitement and speculation arose throughout the country\r\nwhen the trial day approached. Great crowds assembled from every\r\ndirection to witness the trial; some, more sanguine, came to witness\r\nthe success, but far the greater portion came to see the bubble burst.\r\nThe proceedings began at Busselton incline, where the stationary engine\r\ndrew a train up the incline on one side and let it down on the other.\r\nThe wagons were then loaded.\r\n\r\n\"At the foot of this plane a locomotive, driven by Mr. Stephenson\r\nhimself, was attached to the train. It consisted of six wagons loaded\r\nwith coal and flour, next a passenger coach (the first ever run upon\r\na railroad) filled with the directors and their friends, then twenty\r\nwagons fitted up with temporary seats for passengers, and lastly came\r\nsix wagons loaded with coal, making in all twenty-eight vehicles.\r\nThe word being given that all was ready, the engine began to move,\r\ngradually at first, but afterward, in part of the road, attaining a\r\nspeed of twelve miles an hour. At that time the number of passengers\r\namounted to four hundred and fifty, which would, with the remainder\r\nof the load, amount to upwards of ninety tons. The train arrived at\r\nDarlington, eight and three-quarter miles, in sixty-five minutes.\r\nHere it was stopped and a fresh supply of water obtained, the six\r\ncoal-cars for Darlington detached, and the word given to go ahead. The\r\nengine started, and arrived at Stockton, twelve miles, in three hours\r\nand seven minutes including stoppages. By the time the train reached\r\nStockton the number of passengers amounted to over six hundred.\"\r\n\r\nFrom this description it will be seen that the coal roads had been\r\nextended to form interurban railways. In this connection it is\r\ninteresting to note the increase of traffic that developed on this\r\nparticular road in the years immediately following the invention of\r\nthe practical locomotive. When the road was projected it was estimated\r\nthat its maximum carrying capacity would not exceed 10,000 tons of coal\r\nyearly. A few years later, when locomotives had come into use, the\r\nregular yearly carriage amounted to 500,000 tons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A CENTURY'S PROGRESS IN LOCOMOTIVE BUILDING.\r\n\r\nFig. 1.--The Blenkinsop locomotive, built in 1812-13 to work on the\r\nrack Railway between Leeds and the Middleton colliery, a distance of\r\n3.5 miles. This was the first commercially successful enterprise in\r\nwhich steam locomotives were employed. Fig. 2.--Model of locomotive\r\nengine No. 1 of the Stockton and Darlington Railway, England, built by\r\nMessrs R. Stevenson & Company in 1825. This engine ran successfully\r\nfor 21 years. Fig. 3.--The locomotive \"Royal George\" which worked on\r\nthe Stockton and Darlington Railway 1827-1842. It will be observed\r\nthat each of these engines antedated Stevenson's famous \"Rocket.\" Fig.\r\n4.--Shows, by way of contrast with these earliest types of locomotive,\r\nthe \"Twentieth Century Limited\" train of the New York Central Railroad,\r\nand a racing automobile, either of which can easily make better time\r\nthan a mile a minute, as against the two or three miles per hour of\r\ntheir prototypes.]\r\n\r\nThe passenger coach on this first train, the first of its kind\r\never constructed for the special purpose of carrying passengers, was\r\nremarkable for its simplicity. One writer described it as \"a modest\r\nand uncouth-looking affair, made more for strength than for beauty.\r\nA row of seats ran along each side of the interior, and a long table\r\nwas fixed in the centre, the access being by the doorway behind, like\r\nan omnibus. This vehicle was named the _Experiment_, and was the only\r\ncarriage for passengers upon the road for some time.\"\r\n\r\nAbout this time the now famous Liverpool and Manchester Railway was\r\nprojected. It was elaborately planned and carried out at an enormous\r\nexpense. The construction of the road-bed was given special attention,\r\nalthough as yet the question of what motive power should be used had\r\nnot been decided. Most of the directors and engineers favored the use\r\nof horses. The few that were in favor of steam did not favor the use\r\nof locomotives, but a system that would now be called a relay-cable\r\nsystem. According to this plan the road of about thirty miles was to\r\nbe divided into nineteen sections, over each of which a stationary\r\nsteam-engine was to work a chain or cable. But when the board of\r\nengineers appointed to investigate the possibilities of this system\r\nreported on the matter, it was found that there were several vital\r\ndefects in such a system. For example, should any one of the sections\r\nof cable break or become inoperative, the entire line would have to\r\nstand idle; and furthermore, the cost of building and maintaining these\r\nnineteen stations offered serious financial obstacles.\r\n\r\nIt is an interesting fact that until the report of this board was made\r\n\"not a single professional man of eminence could be found who preferred\r\nthe locomotive over the fixed engine, George Stephenson only excepted.\"\r\nBut with the glaring defects of the cable road, and the enormous cost\r\nof maintenance impressed upon the directors, the idea of the locomotive\r\nbecame at once more attractive, and the performance of Stephenson's\r\nlocomotive was more carefully investigated. The upshot of these\r\ninvestigations was the offer of a prize of £500 for a locomotive that,\r\non a certain day would perform certain duties named under the eight\r\nfollowing headings:--\r\n\r\n1. The engine must effectually consume its own smoke.\r\n\r\n2. The engine, if of six tons' weight, must be able to draw, day by\r\nday, twenty tons' weight, including the tender, and water-tank, at ten\r\nmiles an hour, with a pressure of steam upon the boiler not exceeding\r\nfifty pounds to the square inch.\r\n\r\n3. The boiler must have two safety-valves, neither of which must be\r\nfastened down, and one of them completely out of the control of the\r\nengineer.\r\n\r\n4. The engine and boiler must be supported upon springs and rest on six\r\nwheels, the height of the whole not exceeding fifteen feet to the top\r\nof the chimney.\r\n\r\n5. The engine with water must not weigh more than six tons, but\r\nan engine of less weight would be preferred although drawing a\r\nproportionately less load behind it; if of only four and one-half tons\r\nit might be put on four wheels.\r\n\r\n6. A mercurial gauge must be affixed to the machine, showing the steam\r\npressure about forty-five pounds to the square inch.\r\n\r\n7. The engine must be delivered, complete and ready for trial, at the\r\nLiverpool end of the railway, not later than October 1, 1829.\r\n\r\n8. The price of the engine must not exceed £550.\r\n\r\nWhat strikes one as most peculiar in this set of requirements and\r\nspecifications is the first clause--that of the engine consuming its\r\nown smoke; for even at the present time this is considered a difficult\r\nproblem. But this was not so considered by the inventors of that time,\r\ntheir great stumbling-block being the high speed required. Ten miles an\r\nhour struck most of them as absurd and out of the question.\r\n\r\nOne eminent person, who was to become later one of England's leading\r\nengineers, stated publicly that \"if it proved to be possible to make\r\na locomotive go ten miles an hour, he would undertake to eat a stewed\r\nengine-wheel for his breakfast.\" It is not recorded whether or not this\r\nterrible threat was carried out.\r\n\r\nBut there was more than one engineer and engine-builder who took a more\r\nsanguine view of the prize offer. The firm of Braithwait & Ericsson\r\nsignified its intention of competing, with a locomotive that they named\r\nthe _Novelty_. Another firm entered the contest with an engine called\r\nthe _Sans-pareil_; still another firm entered the _Perseverance_; and\r\nGeorge Stephenson was on hand with the now-famous _Rocket_.\r\n\r\nIn the series of trials that followed, the _Sans-pareil_ and the\r\n_Perseverance_ were so clearly outclassed by the other two competing\r\nlocomotives that they need not be considered here; but the _Novelty_\r\nand the _Rocket_ were close competitors. The _Novelty_, indeed,\r\nmade such a good showing, and afterwards proved to be such a good\r\nlocomotive, that although it lost the contest, many competent judges\r\nhave since regarded it as equal to the _Rocket_, if not superior, in\r\nprinciple. Be that as it may, later experiments proved conclusively\r\nthat the cause of failure on the final day of the prize contest was\r\ndue to defects in workmanship rather than to defective principle of\r\nconstruction.\r\n\r\nThe _Novelty_ has been described as having the appearance of \"a\r\nmilk-can set in the rear end of a wagon, with a little smokestack in\r\nfront looking like a high dashboard.\" It carried its supply of fuel\r\nand water in the \"wagon-box\" part of the engine frame, in front of the\r\nboiler, so that it required no tender. On its first trial, running\r\nwithout any load, it reached a speed of twenty-four miles an hour--a\r\nspeed more than double the \"stewed engine-wheel\" limit. But at each\r\nsubsequent trial, although it hauled loads for short distances, some\r\npart of its machinery became disabled, so that it was necessarily\r\nregarded as inferior to its more stable rival, the _Rocket_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CUGNOT'S TRACTION ENGINE AND THE \"NOVELTY\" LOCOMOTIVE.\r\n\r\nThese vehicles are shown together here because of their similarity\r\nof plan of construction. Cugnot's original engine (upper figure) was\r\nbuilt in France in 1769. The vehicle shown above was made in 1770,\r\nafter Cugnot's designs, for the French Government. It was intended for\r\nthe transportation of artillery, and the specifications called for a\r\ncarrying capacity of about 4½ tons and a speed of 2¼ miles per hour\r\non level ground. Cugnot's original engine had attained this speed on\r\na common road while carrying four persons; notwithstanding which fact\r\nthe machine above shown was for some reason never given a trial. It is\r\nnow preserved in the Conservatoire des Arts et Metiers, in Paris. It is\r\nparticularly noteworthy that the successful road engine of Cugnot was\r\nconstructed in 1769, the year in which James Watt took out the first\r\npatents on his steam engine. Just 60 years elapsed before Stephenson's\r\n\"Rocket\" convinced the world of the feasibility of transportation by\r\nsteam-power.\r\n\r\nThe locomotive shown in the lower figure competed in the famous tests\r\nof 1829 against the \"Rocket\" and the \"Sans Pareil.\" It excited much\r\ninterest, attaining a speed of almost 32 miles per hour when running\r\nlight, but owing to breakdowns was unable to fulfill the required tests\r\nand was therefore withdrawn from the competition. It was afterwards\r\nused commercially.]\r\n\r\nThe _Sans-pareil_ was considerably over the maximum weight and\r\naccording to a strict interpretation of the stipulations, should not\r\nhave been allowed to contest; but although this question of over-weight\r\nwas waived by the judges, and the engine given a fair trial, it showed\r\nsuch a capacity for consuming fuel without any corresponding ability to\r\nperform work, that it was decided inferior to the _Novelty_ and the\r\n_Rocket_. The _Perseverance_ was clearly outclassed by all the other\r\ncompeting engines, as its maximum speed was only five or six miles an\r\nhour.\r\n\r\nThe most consistent performer, and the final prize-winner, as everyone\r\nknows, was Stephenson's _Rocket_, the direct ancestor of all modern\r\nlocomotives. The boiler of this locomotive was horizontal, as in\r\nmodern locomotives, cylindrical, and had flat ends. It was six feet in\r\nlength and a little over three feet in diameter. The upper half of the\r\nboiler was used as a reservoir for steam, the lower half being filled\r\nwith water and having copper pipes running through it. The fire-box,\r\ntwo feet wide and three feet high, was placed immediately behind the\r\nboiler. Just above this, and on each side, were the cylinders, two\r\nin number, acting obliquely downward on the two front wheels of the\r\nengine, the piston-rod connecting with the driver by a bar pinned to\r\nthe outside of the wheel, as in modern American locomotives.\r\n\r\nThe engine with its load of water weighed a trifle over four\r\ntons--seemingly little more than a toy-locomotive, as compared with\r\nthe modern monsters more than thirty times that weight. But for its\r\nsize the little _Rocket_ was a marvelous performer, even as judged by\r\nrecent standards. On the first day of the contests over the two miles\r\nof trial tracks, it covered twelve miles in considerably less than an\r\nhour, shuttling back and forth over the road. The next day, as none\r\nof the other engines was in condition to exhibit, Stephenson offered\r\nto satisfy the curiosity of the great crowd that had gathered--a\r\ncrowd that contained representatives from all over the world--by an\r\nunofficial trial of the _Rocket_. He coupled the little engine to a\r\ncar, loaded on thirty-six passengers, and took them for a spin over the\r\nroad at the rate of from twenty-six to thirty miles an hour.\r\n\r\nThe following day some of the competing locomotives were still unable\r\nto exhibit, and again the _Rocket_ was given a semi-official trial.\r\nHauling a car loaded with thirteen tons' weight, it ran back and forth\r\nover the two-mile road, covering thirty-five miles in one hour and\r\nforty-eight minutes including stoppages. The maximum velocity attained\r\nwas about twenty-nine miles an hour. As this performance was duplicated\r\non the day of the official trial, the _Rocket_ was declared the winner,\r\nand awarded the prize.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FAMOUS LOCOMOTIVES \"ROCKET\" AND \"SANS PAREIL.\"\r\n\r\nStevenson's celebrated \"Rocket\" is known to everyone as the winner of\r\nthe competition for the prize of 500 pounds offered in 1829 by the\r\nDirectors of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. The \"Sans Pareil,\"\r\nwhich, like the \"Rocket,\" is still preserved at the South Kensington\r\nMuseum in London, competed unsuccessfully for the prize. Though not\r\nequal to the \"Rocket\" it was in many respects a well-made locomotive.\r\nIt was purchased by the Liverpool and Manchester Railway Company and\r\nsaw many years of active service.]\r\n\r\nNaturally there were many minor defects in the construction of\r\nthis first locomotive, although most of them were too trivial and\r\nunimportant to affect the excellence of the machine as a whole. But it\r\nhad one serious defect: the inclination of the cylinders caused the\r\nentire machine to rise and fall on its springs at every double stroke,\r\nproducing great unsteadiness when running at any considerable speed.\r\nThis was corrected a few months later by the suggestion of Timothy\r\nHackworth, who drew plans for a locomotive having horizontal cylinders\r\nto be used on the Stockton & Darlington Railway. His plans were\r\nsubmitted to Stephenson, who constructed an engine from them called the\r\n_Globe_, which differed from the _Rocket_ in having the cylinders not\r\nonly horizontal, but placed on the inside of the wheels. A little later\r\nStephenson built the _Planet_ on much the same lines as the _Globe_,\r\nand this engine became the model for engine builders the world over. It\r\nis an interesting fact that American engineers adopted, and still cling\r\nto, Stephenson's original plan of having the cylinders act on rods\r\nattached to the outside of the wheels as in the _Rocket_, while English\r\nengineers have always built their locomotives with the cylinders on the\r\ninside, as arranged on the _Planet_.\r\n\r\nSince the time of the _Planet_ the general shape and arrangement of\r\nmost locomotives has remained unchanged. In America the inclemencies of\r\nthe climate compelled the invention of the cab; and it was here also\r\nthat the bell, whistle, pilot, and sand-box were first introduced. But\r\nby 1850 the present type of locomotive had been produced; and although\r\nconstant modifications are being introduced, the general appearance of\r\nthe locomotive remains the same, the difference being mostly in the\r\nbulk.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVEMENTS IN LOCOMOTIVES IN RECENT YEARS\r\n\r\nDuring the closing years of the nineteenth century the general\r\nimprovements in the rolling-stock of railroads, and the constantly\r\nincreasing demand for faster passenger service, stimulated\r\nmanufacturers to attempt numerous improvements as well as many changes\r\nin the size of the more recent types of locomotives. In a general way\r\nthese changes may be summarized as follows: A great increase in the\r\nsize and weight, with increased speed and tractive power; the use\r\nof larger boilers with thicker shells; the substitution of steel\r\nfor cast-iron in certain parts of the locomotive, thereby greatly\r\nincreasing the strength; and finally, the economizing of steam by\r\ncompounding.\r\n\r\nThere is no way of determining the exact amount of increase in the\r\nweight of engines during the last decade, but the figures of some of\r\nthe great manufacturing establishments will give a fair idea of this\r\nincrease in a general way. In one of these establishments the average\r\nweight of a locomotive turned out ten years ago was 92,000 pounds for\r\nthe engine alone, without the tender. At the present time the engines\r\nbeing manufactured by the same firm average 129,000 pounds, an increase\r\nof 37,000 pounds, or something over forty per cent. This average\r\nweight, however, gives but an inadequate conception of the size of the\r\nlargest locomotives now being manufactured. The \"hundred-ton\" engine\r\nhas become a commonplace. In 1909 a locomotive weighing, with its\r\ntenders, 300 tons was manufactured for passenger traffic on the Santa\r\nFé lines.\r\n\r\nIn America there seems to be no limit to the sizes that may be reached;\r\nor at least up to the present time this limit has not been attained. In\r\nEngland and several of the Continental countries a great difficulty has\r\nbeen found to exist in the unlimited size of locomotives, in the fact\r\nthat the bridges and tunnels of these railroads are, almost without\r\nexception, so low that any very great vertical increase in the size of\r\nthe engine is out of the question without reconstructing many miles of\r\nbridges and tunnels at an enormous cost.\r\n\r\nThe increased demand for greater speed has also caused a marked\r\nincrease in the amount of steam pressure per square inch in the\r\nboilers. In 1870 the average was about 130 pounds; by 1890 this had\r\nbeen increased to about 160 pounds; while at the present time steam is\r\nused frequently at a pressure of 225 pounds. Naturally this increase\r\nin pressure compels the use of heavier steel boiler plates. In 1890\r\nthe usual thickness of the steel sheets was one-half inch; but at the\r\npresent time it is no unusual thing to use plates seven-eighths of an\r\ninch in thickness.\r\n\r\nBut probably the most important improvement in locomotive construction\r\nin recent years is the introduction of the compounding principle in the\r\nuse of steam--a system whereby practically the entire energy of the\r\nsteam is utilized, instead of a considerable portion of it being a dead\r\nloss, as in the older type of engine. As every one knows, the passage\r\nof the steam through a single cylinder of an engine does not exhaust\r\nits entire energy. In the compounding system this exhausted steam is\r\nmade to pass through one or more cylinders after coming from the first,\r\nthe energy of all these cylinders being utilized for the production of\r\npower.\r\n\r\nThe application of this principle of compounding is not new even in\r\nthe field of locomotive construction. As early as 1846 patents for\r\na compound locomotive were taken out in the United States, and such\r\nan engine built in 1867; but it is only since 1890 that compound\r\nlocomotives have become popular in this country. In these compound\r\nlocomotives the two cylinders are of unequal diameter, so proportioned\r\n\"that the steam at high pressure in the smaller cylinder exerts upon\r\nthe piston approximately the same force that is exerted by steam at a\r\nlower pressure in the larger cylinder. Steam is admitted first into the\r\nsmaller cylinder, where it expends a portion of its initial energy, and\r\nthen passes into the larger cylinder, where it performs an equal amount\r\nof work by exerting a diminished pressure upon a larger surface. This\r\nis the principle of compounding, the relative sizes and positions of\r\nthe cylinders being varied according to the conditions to be met by the\r\nengine, or the ideas of the designer or builder, or of the purchaser.\r\nWhile in the marine and stationary engine the compound principle has\r\nbeen carried with success and economy to three and four stages of\r\nexpansion in the use of steam, it has not been found practicable to go\r\nbeyond two stages in compound locomotives.\"\r\n\r\nIn a pamphlet issued recently by one of the leading locomotive works of\r\nthe country, some points of interest concerning the compound locomotive\r\nwere stated concisely as follows:\r\n\r\n\"In stationary-engine practice the chief measure of the boiler\r\nefficiency is the economical consumption of coal. In most stationary\r\nengines the boilers are fired independently, and the draft is formed\r\nfrom causes entirely separate and beyond the control of the escape\r\nof steam from the cylinders. Hence any economy shown by the boilers\r\nmust of necessity be separate and distinct from that which may be\r\neffected by the engine itself. In a locomotive, however, the amount\r\nof work depends entirely upon the weight on the driving wheels, the\r\ncylinder dimensions being proportioned to this weight, and, whether\r\nthe locomotive is compound or single expansion, no larger boiler can\r\nbe provided, after allowing for the wheels, frame and mechanism, than\r\nthe total limit of weight permits. The heating surface and grate areas\r\nin both compound and single-expansion locomotives of the same class\r\nare practically the same, and the evaporative efficiency of both\r\nlocomotives is chiefly determined by the action of the exhaust, which\r\nmust be of sufficient intensity in both cases to generate the amount\r\nof steam necessary for utilizing to the best advantage the weight on\r\nthe driving wheels. This is a feature that does not appear in any\r\nstationary engine, so that the compound locomotive cannot be judged\r\nby stationary standards, and the only true comparison to be made is\r\nbetween locomotives of similar construction and weight, equipped in one\r\ncase with compound and in the other with single-expansion cylinders.\r\n\r\n\"No locomotive, compound or single-expansion, will haul more than its\r\nadhesion will allow. The weight on driving wheels is the limiting\r\nfactor in the problem which confronts the locomotive engineer. Power\r\ncan, of course, be increased by building a larger engine and augmenting\r\nthis weight but in the present construction of tracks and bridges the\r\nlimit of driving wheel load has almost been reached. Hence in modern\r\nlocomotive practice the goal before the designer and engineer is to\r\nobtain maximum efficiency for the minimum weight admissible.\r\n\r\n\"It is not claimed for compound locomotives that a heavier train can\r\nbe hauled at a given speed than with a single-expansion locomotive of\r\nsimilar weight and class; but the compound will, at very slow speed,\r\non heavy grades, keep a train moving where a single-expansion will\r\nslip and stall. This is due to the pressure on the crank-pins of the\r\ncompound being more uniform throughout the stroke than in the case\r\nof the single-expansion locomotive, and also to the fact that, when\r\nneeded, live steam can be admitted to the low-pressure cylinders.\"\r\n\r\nOf course, the principal reason for compounding the locomotive is\r\nto economize steam, and this is unquestionably accomplished; but\r\nnevertheless the comparative economy of compound and single-expansion\r\nlocomotives was for some time a mooted question. Numerous tests have\r\nbeen made with these two classes of engines, and the widest ranges of\r\ndifferences were shown in many instances. In some cases the compounds\r\nseem to show a saving of some forty per cent. in fuel; but this is by\r\nno means a determinative factor in the daily use of an engine. It is\r\nfound that repairs on the compound are more difficult to make, and\r\nconsequently more expensive than on the single-expansion engines; but\r\non the whole it is very generally conceded that the compound saves its\r\nowners from ten to twenty-five per cent. over the older type.\r\n\r\nThe rapid increase of the size, and consequent coal-consuming capacity,\r\nof the modern locomotive has added another problem to engineering--that\r\nof keeping the yawning maw of the fire-box supplied with coal. There\r\nis a limit to the amount of work that the fireman can do, and the great\r\nengines in use at present tax even the strongest fireman to the utmost.\r\nIf the size or speed of locomotives is increased very materially in\r\nthe future it will be necessary to have two men, instead of one, as\r\nfiremen, or to use mechanical stokers, or to find some other kind of\r\nfuel. In point of fact the mechanical stoker has been recently tried\r\nwith success, and this will probably help in solving the problem. But\r\nthere is also the strong probability that the use of liquid fuel will\r\nbecome more and more popular. At the present time many locomotives\r\nin the West and Southwest, as well as in Europe and in Asia, have\r\nbeen equipped with burners for the consumption of crude petroleum. No\r\nmodification in the construction of the locomotive is required for\r\nthis change of fuel except some slight alteration in the arrangement\r\nof the brickwork of the fire-box, and the introduction of the burners.\r\nThese, however, are simple arrangements that throw into the fire-box, a\r\nspray of steam and vaporized oil, which burns freely and generates an\r\nintense and steady heat. With this kind of fuel the fireman need not be\r\nconsidered, as the largest engine thus equipped may be \"fired\" with far\r\nless labor than is required on the smallest coal-burning, narrow-gauge\r\nlocomotive.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WESTINGHOUSE AIR BRAKE\r\n\r\nThe application of steam as a motive power for running trains of cars\r\nsolved one great problem; but it created another. The second one was\r\nthe problem of how to stop the trains once they had started. On short\r\ntrains made up of the light cars used at first, the hand brakes were\r\nsufficiently effective for practical purposes. But as trains were\r\nincreased in length and weight and were run at high speeds, it became\r\nimperative to find some means of stopping such trains quickly and with\r\ncertainty.\r\n\r\nWith a hand brake working on each pair of trucks, as on passenger\r\ncoaches, it was possible to make reasonably quick stops when there were\r\nenough members of the train crew to work all the brakes simultaneously.\r\nBut in practice it was found impossible to maintain this ideal\r\ncondition. For emergency stops the brakemen were summoned by signals\r\nof the whistle given by the engineer, and there was necessarily some\r\nlittle interval of time after this signal before the most alert crew\r\ncould begin the relatively slow process of applying the brakes.\r\n\r\nThe engineer himself could give valuable aid in stopping the train by\r\nreversing his engine, the locomotive acting as a brake to check the\r\noncoming cars. But this check acted only at the forward part of the\r\ntrain, and being applied suddenly, caused the rear cars to rush against\r\nthe forward cars with terrific force, sometimes driving in the bumpers\r\nand wrecking the train. Obviously an ideal system of brakes must be\r\none that acted upon all the cars of the train simultaneously and under\r\ncontrol of the engineer; and presently such a system was invented by\r\nMr. George Westinghouse.\r\n\r\nOther inventors had tried to produce a practical system of brakes,\r\nsuch as those using steam as a working force, or systems of hand-wound\r\nsprings; but Mr. Westinghouse utilized compressed air, and from the\r\nfirst his brakes proved effective.\r\n\r\nHis first air brake, operated successfully in 1869, was the \"straight\r\nair brake\" type--one that has now been replaced almost universally by\r\nthe automatic. In this brake system there was an air reservoir on the\r\nlocomotive, and steam was used for making the compression. From this\r\nreservoir a line of gas pipe ran through the cab of the engine beneath\r\nthe tender and under each car, the space between the cars being bridged\r\nby rubber tubes and easily-adjusted couplings. This line of pipe,\r\ncalled the train pipe, was connected near the centre of each car with\r\na cylinder which contained a piston with a stem which acted upon the\r\nbrake shoes by means of a series of levers and connecting rods.\r\n\r\nIn the cab, placed conveniently for the engineer, was a valve by means\r\nof which he could cause the compressed air to flow into the train\r\npipe and thus act upon the brake cylinders of the cars. This could be\r\ndone gradually for making a slow stop, or with full force as the case\r\nrequired, and the brakes could be released by turning the valve to a\r\npoint which opened a vent and allowed the air to escape.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this invention was revolutionary. Stopping the train\r\nwas no longer dependent upon manual labor applied intermittently at\r\ndifferent points, but was placed entirely in the hands of the engineer\r\nwho applied the required power almost simultaneously at all points\r\nalong his line of cars. Thus the brakeman was relieved of one of his\r\nperilous tasks, which on freight trains took a heavy toll in loss of\r\nlives.\r\n\r\nThis relatively simple, and usually effective, system had two grave\r\ndefects. The first of these lay in the fact that if there was a\r\nleak--even a very small one--anywhere along the line of the train pipe\r\nor the brake cylinders, the brakes would not work, the compressed air\r\nbeing exhausted into the atmosphere instead of acting on the brake\r\ncylinders. The common accident of having his train \"break in two\"\r\nrendered the engineer powerless to stop the cars, and disastrous\r\n\"runaways\" sometimes resulted. The second defect, which became more\r\nand more apparent as the length of trains was increased, was the\r\nimpossibility of applying the air to the brakes of the rear cars as\r\nquickly as to those near the engine, since the compressed air could not\r\ntravel the length of the train pipe instantaneously, on account of the\r\nfrictional resistance.\r\n\r\nThese defects were quickly recognized by Mr. Westinghouse, and in\r\n1876, seven years after he applied his first invention, he produced\r\nhis automatic air brake which overcame them effectually. In this brake\r\nthe train pipe and the air reservoir were retained as in the straight\r\nair brake system, but in addition each car was equipped with a storage\r\nreservoir of sufficient size to supply the brake cylinder. In place\r\nof the older arrangement in which the train pipe simply retained air\r\nat atmospheric pressure when not in use, the new system kept the air\r\nin the train pipe under a considerable pressure at all times when the\r\nbrake was not in use. And, reversing the conditions of the straight air\r\nbrake, the engineer in order to apply the brakes let out the air in\r\nthe train pipe instead of forcing air into it, a \"triple valve\" on each\r\ncar performing the work of operating the brake cylinder automatically.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of this system over the older one is obvious. Whereas the\r\ndetachment of a portion of the train, or a leak in any part of the air\r\nbrake system heretofore had left the engineer helpless, exactly the\r\nreverse condition was produced in the new system. Any leakage of air,\r\neither from a break or a defect, caused every brake on the entire train\r\nto be applied to the wheels and brought the train to a stop. Moreover,\r\nwith the new system it was now possible to equip each car with a valve\r\nwhich would lessen the pressure of air in the train pipe so that\r\nthe train could be brought to a stop by the trainmen in the rear or\r\nintermediate coaches as readily as by the engineer.\r\n\r\nThis system worked perfectly on passenger trains; but on long freight\r\ntrains the resistance to the passage of the escaping air through the\r\ntrain tube was so great that if an emergency required the full force\r\nof the brake to be applied suddenly, the brakes of the rear cars did\r\nnot come into use until several seconds after those of the forward\r\ncars. The result was that the momentum of the rear cars caused them\r\nto strike the forward cars with great violence. But Mr. Westinghouse\r\novercame this defect by an ingenious use of the triple valve mechanism\r\nof each car, whereby the application of the emergency brake by the\r\nengineer caused the air in the train pipe on each car to be discharged\r\nsimultaneously into the brake cylinder. In this manner the discharge\r\nof air not only allowed the brakes to act, but assisted them in doing\r\nso. This was only the case, however, when the emergency application of\r\nthe brake was made, this system of venting on each car into the brake\r\ncylinder not being brought into play when ordinary stops were made.\r\nThus the engineer in this quick-action automatic air brake has really\r\ntwo brakes at his command, one for making ordinary stops, the other for\r\nemergencies.\r\n\r\nIn 1891 a so-called high-speed air brake was perfected, this brake\r\nbeing really a modified quick-action automatic brake. This modification\r\nconsists of the addition of an automatic pressure-reducing valve\r\nconnected with each brake cylinder. In the high-speed air brake as\r\napplied when the train is running rapidly, the highest possible\r\npressure is applied at once to the wheels, but this pressure is\r\nlessened by the automatic pressure-reducing valves as the speed\r\ndiminishes. This method of applying the brakes is the most effective\r\nway of getting the full benefit of their stopping power. This\r\nhigh-speed brake, therefore, represents the highest perfection in\r\ntrain-stopping devices.\r\n\r\nWe have referred here specifically to the air brake as used on steam\r\nrailroads. In another chapter the subject has been touched upon in\r\nconnection with electric railroads. In such brakes the compression\r\nof the air is accomplished by electricity instead of steam, but the\r\ngeneral principles involved are the same as those just described.\r\n\r\nIt should not be understood that the Westinghouse air brake was the\r\nonly one, or the only type of brake, devised and brought to practical\r\nperfection. For a time a vacuum brake, which utilized atmospheric\r\npressure, offered keen rivalry. But eventually the type of brake\r\nperfected by Mr. Westinghouse, modified in certain details in the\r\nvarious countries of Europe and America, gained precedence, which it\r\nstill retains.\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTOMATIC COUPLINGS\r\n\r\nThe perfection of the air brake removed one great source of danger\r\nthat menaced the crews of freight trains. There still remained another\r\nalmost as great, particularly in the matter of maiming its victims,\r\nwhen not actually killing them. This was the old method of coupling\r\nfreight cars as practiced in America. There were few old-time trainmen,\r\nindeed, who could show a complete set of full length digits, the\r\nbuffers of the old-fashioned couplings being responsible for the lost\r\nand shortened members.\r\n\r\nThe freight brakeman has to make scores of couplings on every trip. And\r\nhe literally took his life in his hands upon each and every occasion of\r\nmaking a coupling by the old method.\r\n\r\nThis old form of couplings consisted of two buffers--one on each\r\ncar--joined together by an iron link about fifteen inches long, a\r\nmovable pin inserted at either end holding the link in place and thus\r\njoining the cars. When a coupling was to be made the brakeman raised\r\nthe pin in the buffer of the stationary car and tilted it at an angle\r\nin the pin-hole at the top of the buffer so that, while it remained\r\nraised, the jar of the striking buffers at the moment of coupling\r\ncaused it to fall into place and complete the coupling. The link\r\nwas left hanging in the moving car which was being shunted in to be\r\ncoupled; but in this position the projecting end was so low that it\r\nwould miss the hole in the opposite buffer, and thus fail to make the\r\ncoupling, unless raised and inserted just at the moment before the\r\nbuffers came together.\r\n\r\nThis raising and inserting of the link was the dangerous part of making\r\na coupling. It could only be done by the brakeman while standing\r\nbetween the cars. And he must raise the link, insert it, and remove\r\nhis hand in a fraction of a second if the car was moving at a fair\r\nrate of speed, otherwise his fingers or hand would be caught between\r\nthe buffers and crushed. And a crushed hand or arm meant subsequent\r\namputation, for the force of the collision between the buffers crushed\r\nthe bones beyond repair.\r\n\r\nThere was a way in which the coupling could be made whereby the hand\r\nwas not endangered. This was by using a stick for raising and guiding\r\nthe link into the buffer. Some railroads at first furnished sticks for\r\nthis purpose. But no brakeman would stoop to use them. Had he done so\r\nhe would have been hooted and jeered off the road by his train mates.\r\nAnd so his pride made him risk his limbs and his life, and fostered the\r\nrecklessness of the old-time brakeman.\r\n\r\nBut in 1879 Mr. Eli Janney, of Pittsburg, patented an automatic\r\ncar-coupler that was both simple and effective; and in 1887 the Master\r\nCar Builders' Association accepted this type of coupler. A little later\r\nthe U. S. Government, influenced by the appalling loss of life among\r\nthe brakemen, passed laws compelling all cars to be equipped with some\r\nform of automatic coupling device, and naturally the Janney coupling\r\nwas the one adopted. In using this coupling the brakeman did not have\r\nto step into the dangerous position between the cars, either for making\r\nthe coupling, or disconnecting the car. The act of coupling was done\r\nautomatically, while the uncoupling was effected by the use of a lever\r\noperated from the side of the car.\r\n\r\nA somewhat technical description of this coupling is as follows:\r\n\r\n\"The Janney coupling consists of a steel jaw fitted on one side with a\r\nknuckle or L-shaped lever turning on a vertical pin; this knuckle when\r\nbeing swung inward lifts a locking pin which subsequently drops and so\r\nprevents the return of the knuckle. An identical coupler is fitted to\r\nthe end of the adjacent vehicle, and, so long as both or either of the\r\nknuckles are open when the vehicles come into contact, coupling will\r\nbe effected; to uncouple, it is only necessary to raise either of the\r\nlocking pins, by means of a chain or lever at the side of the vehicle.\r\nThe knuckles have each a hole in them to permit of the use of the\r\nold link and pin coupler, when such a fitting is met with. At first,\r\nthis coupling gave some trouble through the locking pins occasionally\r\ncreeping upward, but in the larger model, which represents the later\r\nform, there is an automatic locking pawl that prevents this motion;\r\nowing, however, to the pawl being attached to the lifting shackle, it\r\nin no way interferes with the pin being raised when disconnecting.\"\r\n\r\nEven before the invention of the Janney coupling a semi-automatic\r\ncoupling device had been used extensively on passenger cars. But this\r\ndevice which in effect was that of two crooked fingers hooked together,\r\nallowed the ends of the coaches to swing and roll in a manner most\r\ndisagreeable to many passengers. The Janney couplings corrected this,\r\nsince these couplings in their improved form hold the ends of the cars\r\nas in a vice.\r\n\r\n\r\nA COMPARISON--THE OLD AND THE NEW\r\n\r\nStephenson's locomotive and its tender, when loaded to full capacity\r\nwith fuel and water, weighed seven and three-quarter tons. The\r\nlocomotive itself was a trifle over seven feet long. In 1909 the\r\nSouthern Pacific Railway purchased a Mallet Compound locomotive which,\r\nwith its tender, weighs three hundred tons, or approximately forty\r\ntimes the weight of the little _Rocket_. This great locomotive is over\r\nsixty-seven feet long, or some nine times the length of the _Rocket_,\r\nand will haul more than twelve hundred tons back of the tender.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE LOCOMOTIVE.\r\n\r\nThe lower figure represents a longitudinal section of a modern French\r\nlocomotive, for comparison with the sections of the famous engines of\r\n1829. The weight of the \"Rocket,\" with its four-wheel tender which\r\ncarried 264 gallons of water and 450 pounds of coke was 4¼ tons. The\r\nFrench locomotive with its tender in working order, carrying 3300\r\ngallons of water and five tons of coal, weighs 99 tons, and the length\r\nof the engine and tender is 56.3 feet.]\r\n\r\nThe cylinders of the _Rocket_ were eight inches in diameter, with a\r\nseventeen inch stroke; the high-pressure cylinders of this Mallet\r\nlocomotive are twenty-six inches in diameter, and the low-pressure\r\ncylinders are forty inches. But curiously enough the driving wheels of\r\nthe two engines show little discrepancy, those of the _Rocket_ being\r\nfifty-six inches in diameter, as against fifty-seven for those of the\r\nlarger engine. The total heating surface of the _Rocket_ was one\r\nhundred and thirty-eight square feet, that of the new locomotive 6,393\r\nsquare feet. To heat this great surface oil is used for fuel, so that\r\nthe task for the fireman is lighter than on many locomotives less than\r\none-half the size.\r\n\r\nOn this locomotive there are two sets of cylinders driving two sets\r\nof driving wheels on each side, making a total of sixteen drivers in\r\nall. From the size of these drivers it is evident that the engine is\r\ndesigned for strength rather than speed, although of course relatively\r\nhigh speed can be attained if desired. On the section of road over\r\nwhich it operates there is a maximum grade of one hundred and sixteen\r\nfeet per mile, and it was for negotiating such grades with full loads\r\nthat the locomotive was designed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nFROM CART TO AUTOMOBILE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe use of the wheel as a means of reducing friction dates from\r\nprehistoric times. The introduction of this device must have marked a\r\nveritable revolution in transportation, but unfortunately we have no\r\nmeans of knowing in what age or country the innovation was effected. We\r\nonly know that the Chinese have used wheelbarrows and carts from time\r\nimmemorial, and that sundry very ancient pictures and sculptures of\r\nthe Egyptians and Babylonians prove that these peoples were entirely\r\nfamiliar with wheeled vehicles.\r\n\r\nThe earliest form of wheel was doubtless a solid disk, and such a wheel\r\nis still in use in many places in the East; but the wheels of the\r\nAssyrian chariot were spoked after the modern fashion, and provided\r\nwith rims of metal. The introduction of the wagon spring, however, was\r\na comparatively modern innovation. The use of springs very considerably\r\nreduces the resistance, thus adding to the efficiency of wheeled\r\nvehicles; but the reduction is not very obvious unless the roads are\r\ntolerably good, nor is it probable that the ancient nations could\r\nreadily have measured the effect even had the idea of springs suggested\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nAs regards good roads, these are, to be sure, no modern invention,\r\nsince the Romans had carried the art of road-building to a very high\r\ndegree of perfection. The integrity of the Roman Empire depended very\r\nlargely upon the highways that linked all parts of its circumference\r\nwith the Imperial centre; and in a perfectly literal sense all its\r\nroads led to Rome. The Roman roadbed was constructed of several layers\r\nof stone, and it was one of the most resistant and permanent structures\r\never devised. As late as the sixteenth century of our era there were\r\nno roads worthy of the name in England except the remains of those\r\nconstructed many centuries before by the Roman occupants. It was not\r\nuntil well toward the close of the eighteenth century that Macadam and\r\nTelford devised methods of road-making whereby broken stone and gravel,\r\npounded to form a smooth surface, gave the modern world roadbeds that\r\nwere in any way comparable to those early ones of the Romans.\r\n\r\nThis development of road-building corresponded, naturally enough,\r\nwith an advance in the art of carriage building, and the increased\r\npopularity of stage coaches. We are told that about 1650 the average\r\nrate of speed of the stage wagons in England was only four miles an\r\nhour; whereas the stage coaches moved over the improved roadbeds of\r\nthe nineteenth century at an average speed of about eight miles an\r\nhour, which was sometimes increased to eleven miles. After about the\r\nyear 1836, however, the stage coach was rapidly displaced by the steam\r\nrailway, and the interest in roadbeds somewhat abated until brought\r\nagain prominently to public attention by the users of bicycles and\r\nautomobiles.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEVELOPMENT OF THE BICYCLE\r\n\r\nIt is rather surprising to learn that in point of time the automobile\r\nantedates the bicycle. Yet such, as we shall see in a moment, is\r\nthe fact. Every one is aware, however, that the bicycle came into\r\npopularity at a time when the very existence of the automobile had been\r\npractically forgotten, and that subsequently it lost its popularity\r\nalmost over night when the automobile came to its own. Viewing the\r\nsubject retrospectively, perhaps the most singular thing is that both\r\nvehicles were so long delayed in making their way to public favor.\r\nThere were, however, sundry very practical obstacles placed in the\r\nway of the larger vehicle; and the bicycle was not at first a device\r\ncalculated to prove attractive to the average wayfarer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE HOBBY-HORSE OF 1820 CONTRASTED WITH THE MOTOR CYCLE\r\nOF TO-DAY.\r\n\r\nFor a brief period about 1820 the hobby horse was very popular with\r\nEnglish dandies. Our illustration reproduces a contemporary print. The\r\n(1909) motor cycle shown in the small picture is compassing a mile in\r\n40 seconds.]\r\n\r\nThe very earliest bicycle appears to have been the so-called hobby\r\nhorse or dandy horse introduced about the year 1818 by Baron von Drais\r\nin France. It was a primitive vehicle, the user of which half rode\r\nand half ran, propulsion being effected simply by thrusting the feet\r\nagainst the ground. In effect the rider of the hobby horse ran with a\r\nstride greatly lengthened through the partial support afforded by the\r\nsaddle, and with correspondingly increased speed. He could, of course,\r\non occasion coast down hill or on a level surface when considerable\r\nmomentum had been acquired, and supports for his feet were provided to\r\nfacilitate this end. At first the machine promised to become popular,\r\nbut it was soon ridiculed out of court.\r\n\r\nSomething like twenty years later--that is to say about the year\r\n1840--a treadle-bicycle was invented by Kirkpatrick MacMillan, an\r\nEnglish blacksmith. The machine did not become popular, however, and\r\nit was not until simple cranks were fitted to the front wheel of the\r\nbicycle that this form of vehicle came into anything like general\r\nuse. This very simple expedient was first suggested, seemingly, by\r\nPierre Lallament, a Frenchman, in 1866. His machine came to be known\r\nin England as the bone shaker, and doubtless it deserved its name, for\r\nas yet neither the wire suspension wheel nor the rubber tire had been\r\ninvented. Both these improvements were quickly introduced, however;\r\nthe suspension wheel by Mr. E. A. Cowper, in 1868. The first rubber\r\ntires, used about 1870, were solid, and it was not until 1888 that the\r\nIrishman, Mr. J. B. Dunlap, introduced the pneumatic tire. Meantime the\r\ngeared bicycle, with which every one is nowadays familiar, had been\r\nintroduced in 1879 by Mr. H. J. Lawson and brought to the familiar form\r\nof the \"safety\" in 1885 by Mr. Starley. The combination of low wheels\r\ngeared to any desired speed with pneumatic tires was the finishing\r\nstroke.\r\n\r\nThe problem of making the bicycle a relatively speedy vehicle had\r\nindeed been solved by the use of a large wheel--sometimes sixty inches\r\nin diameter--operated by a simple crank after the manner of the early\r\nmachine of Lallament; but while bicycles of this type attained a\r\nconsiderable measure of popularity, the danger of taking a \"header\"\r\non encountering any obstacle in the road was one that seemed to the\r\naverage person to out-measure the pleasure or benefit to be derived\r\nfrom rapid transit thus attained. The safety bicycle, however,\r\npractically eliminated this danger. It was, moreover, comparatively\r\neasy to balance; and not long after its introduction in perfected form,\r\nwith pneumatic tires, it had made an appeal to which all the world\r\nresponded. For a few years the safety bicycle was the most conspicuous\r\nof vehicles on every country road, and partisans of outdoor life\r\nbelieved that the health and stamina of the generation were to be\r\nincreased immensely by the new vehicle.\r\n\r\nNor were these anticipations altogether visionary, as undoubtedly\r\nthe bicycle did do much to improve the average health of nearly all\r\nclasses of citizens. But its popularity was too suddenly acquired to\r\nbe permanent, and at the very moment when it was most used, another\r\nvehicle was suddenly developed which was to lead to its practical\r\nabandonment by the great mass of people for whom it might have been\r\nsupposed to afford a means of permanent recreation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE EVOLUTION OF THE BICYCLE.\r\n\r\nFig. 1.--The hobby horse or dandy horse, the forerunner of the bicycle,\r\nwhich was patented in France in 1818 by Charles, Baron von Drais.\r\nFig. 2.--The so-called \"Bone Shaker\" invented about 1865 by Pierre\r\nLallement.

Hillman in 1884.\r\nThe peculiarity consists in the use of a chain gearing to increase\r\nthe speed of the wheel. The principle is precisely that of the modern\r\nbicycle, though the application of the chain to the front wheel made a\r\ncumbersome apparatus.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COMING OF THE AUTOMOBILE\r\n\r\nThe vehicle that effected this sudden eclipse of the bicycle is, as\r\neveryone knows, that form of power-driven carriage known in England as\r\nthe motor car, and in France and America as the automobile. The first\r\nform of this vehicle to gain popularity was a tricycle driven by a\r\nsmall steam motor. But almost immediately the recently devised gas\r\nengine was called into requisition, and after that the development of\r\nthe automobile was only a matter of detail. But, as so often happens\r\nwith practical inventions, there are disputed questions of priority\r\nregarding the application of the gasoline engine to this particular\r\nuse. The engine itself was perfected, as we have elsewhere seen, about\r\n1876, by the German, Dr. Otto.\r\n\r\nIt appears that in 1879 an American, Mr. George B. Selden, applied for\r\na patent designed to cover the use of the internal combustion engine as\r\na motor for road vehicles. Owing to technical complications the patent\r\nwas not actually issued until the year 1895. Meantime at least as early\r\nas 1885 Herr Daimler in Germany had used the gasoline motor for the\r\npractical propulsion of a tricycle; and not long after that date the\r\nright to use his patents had been acquired in France by Messrs. Panhard\r\nand Levassor. These men soon applied the Daimler motor to four-wheeled\r\nvehicles of various types, and almost at a bound the automobile as we\r\nknow it was developed. Early in the '90's the custom of having annual\r\nroad races was introduced, and before the century had closed the\r\nautomobile was everywhere a familiar object on the roads of Europe and\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nWhile the introduction of the automobile is thus a comparatively recent\r\nevent, it should be known that the idea of using mechanical power\r\nto propel a road vehicle is by no means peculiar to our generation.\r\nPractical working automobiles were constructed long before any person\r\nnow living was born. The very first person to construct such a vehicle\r\nwas probably the Frenchman, Cugnot, who manufactured a steam-driven\r\nwagon, using the old Newcomen type of engine, in the very year--by a\r\ncurious coincidence--in which James Watt took out his first patent for\r\na perfected steam engine; that is to say, in the year 1769.\r\n\r\nCugnot's automobile was a heavy four-wheeled affair intended for\r\nmilitary service. It actually progressed along the road at the rate\r\nof three or four miles an hour. But the problem of carrying fuel and\r\nwater had not been solved, and either for that reason or because\r\nthe authorities in charge lacked imagination and did not regard the\r\ndevice as offering advantages over traction by horses, nothing came of\r\nCugnot's effort except the scientific demonstration that the idea of\r\na self-propelled vehicle was not merely the dream of a visionary. A\r\nsecond automobile truck of similar design, made by Cugnot a year or two\r\nlater, may be seen to this day in the Museum of Arts and Measures in\r\nParis.\r\n\r\nA few years later--namely in 1785--an Englishman, William Murdoch by\r\nname, whose interest in steam engines is evidenced by the fact that he\r\nwas in the employ of Bolton and Watt, manufactured a small tricycle\r\ndriven by a Watt engine. This vehicle, running under its own power,\r\ndeveloped a good degree of speed; and had not Murdoch's employers\r\nforbidden him to continue his experiments, the practical automobile\r\nmight perhaps have gained popularity an entire century earlier than it\r\ndid.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE EXTREMES OF AUTOMOBILE DEVELOPMENT.\r\n\r\nAt the left, William Murdock's automobile of about the year 1781.\r\nMurdock made several experimental models which worked successfully,\r\nbut strangely enough Bolton and Watt, his employers, discouraged\r\nhis efforts and induced him ultimately to abandon the invention,\r\nwhich nevertheless had demonstrated the possibility of propelling a\r\nvehicle by steam power. At the right, the original model of Richard\r\nTrevethick's road locomotive, constructed in 1797. The success of\r\nthis model led Trevethick to construct a steam carriage which was\r\nsuccessfully tried on the roads in England in 1801. The small picture\r\nin the upper corner shows the modern craft that is the outgrowth of\r\nthese crude vehicles--the winning automobile in the Vanderbilt race on\r\nLong Island in 1909.]\r\n\r\nAs the case stands, however, the automobile of Murdoch failed as\r\nsignally as had that of Cugnot to gain general recognition. But it is\r\nquite possible that a knowledge of the device had come to the attention\r\nof another Englishman, Richard Trevithick by name, who was at once a\r\npractical experimenter of great skill and a man of fertile imagination.\r\nTrevithick, himself the inventor of a high-pressure steam engine,\r\nadjusted his engine to a large road vehicle, and in the year 1804\r\nexhibited this automobile on the roads of Cornwall, and subsequently\r\nin London, where it would probably have made its way had not the\r\ninventor been an extremely erratic genius, who presently shut up his\r\ncoach and turned his attention to another form of vehicle. This, it\r\nwill be observed, was full twenty-five years before that memorable\r\ndate on which Stephenson launched his famous _Rocket_. Nothing came of\r\nTrevithick's experiment at the moment, beyond the demonstration of a\r\nprinciple--which indeed was much; but it was not long before various\r\nother inventors took up the idea, and as early as 1824 a number of\r\nautomobiles, some of them weighing as much as three or four tons, were\r\nin successful operation on the highways of England. Some of these even\r\ngave regular passenger service, and attained the unprecedented speed\r\nof twelve or fourteen miles an hour. All this, it will be observed,\r\nwas before the first locomotive running on rails had attracted any\r\nattention. Stephenson had indeed begun his experiments, but up to this\r\ntime they had been confined exclusively to tramways in connection with\r\ncollieries.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1829 Stephenson made his famous demonstrations with the\r\n_Rocket_, a locomotive running on rails, which attained a speed of\r\nthirty miles an hour, contrary to all the predictions of the wiseacres,\r\nwho had declared the inventor a lunatic for hoping to attain even ten\r\nmiles. We have already noted that the railway on which the test was\r\nmade was not built with the expectation of utilizing steam power, that\r\nbeing regarded as a dreamer's vision. Lord Darlington prevented the\r\nconstruction of the road for a time because it chanced to run near his\r\nfox covers; and legislative permission was finally secured only with\r\nthe proviso that the railway was to avoid the region of the preserves.\r\nStephenson with difficulty secured permission to make an experiment\r\non the railway with his engine, in competition with other would-be\r\ninventors; and it was his unexpected success that turned the scale in\r\nfavor of steam power. But even the startling success of the Rocket did\r\nnot make a great impression upon the British public, the incident being\r\ngiven but slight notice in the periodicals of the day, and no mention\r\nbeing made of it in the _Annual Register_.\r\n\r\nAll this is of interest as showing the attitude of a conservative\r\npublic toward the steam locomotive running on a railway, and as\r\npartially explaining the antagonism to self-propelled road vehicles\r\nwhich found, most unfortunately, an exponent in no less a personage\r\nthan the Duke of Wellington, then prime minister. The opinion and\r\nattitude of the duke were made evident in 1829, in connection with a\r\nsteam automobile invented by a Mr. Gurney, which was capable of running\r\non an ordinary road at a rate of at least ten miles an hour. The duke\r\nwas old, and age had strengthened his inherent conservatism. He lent\r\na ready ear to the claims--largely instigated, no doubt, by persons\r\ninterested in horse traffic--that the automobile on an ordinary road\r\nwas a menace to public safety, and no doubt his influence had a large\r\nshare in helping on the unfavorable public opinion and the adverse\r\nlegislation which were presently to block the further progress of the\r\nmotor car.\r\n\r\nDoubtless also the amazing success of the railway locomotive tended\r\nto attract the attention of the public away from the automobile, and\r\nthus made possible the passage of restrictive laws. In any event, the\r\nmotor car, notwithstanding its demonstrated possibilities, virtually\r\npassed from the scene at about the time when the railway locomotive\r\nmade its spectacular entrance. That public interest in the matter did\r\nnot subside immediately, however, is evidenced by the fact that such a\r\nbook as Gordon's _Treatise on Elementary Locomotion by Means of Steam\r\nCarriages on Common Roads_ passed through three editions between the\r\nyears 1832 and 1836.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN EXTRAORDINARY PIECE OF LEGISLATION\r\n\r\nIndeed, notwithstanding legislative rebuffs, here and there an inventor\r\nkept up his experiments, and in 1861 the automobile had attained so\r\nmuch prominence as to be given parliamentary attention. Four years\r\nlater, in 1865, an extraordinary law was passed which deserves to be\r\nremembered as one of the greatest monuments of legislative folly ever\r\nrecorded in connection with an economic question. This law provided\r\nthat, in the case of any locomotive moving on a public highway, the\r\nnumber of persons required to drive the engine should be increased to\r\nthree, and that the vehicle should be preceded by a man with a red flag.\r\n\r\nThe latter provision suggests at first sight that the British\r\nlegislator had here been moved to curiously un-British facetiousness;\r\nbut there was really no such intent, as another provision of the\r\nlaw, limiting the maximum speed to four miles an hour, sufficiently\r\ntestifies.\r\n\r\nOther laws of similar tenor supported this one, and the validity of\r\nthese decrees was finally sustained through an appeal to the Court of\r\nQueen's Bench, which brought forth the decision that the law applied to\r\nevery type of self-propelled vehicle from the traction engine to the\r\nBateman steam tricycle. Naturally this decision gave the quietus to\r\nautomobile--or, to use the more English word, motor car--progress in\r\nGreat Britain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN ENGLISH STEAM COACH OF 1827 AND A NEW YORK TAXICAB OF\r\n1909.\r\n\r\nThe steam coach constructed in 1827 by Sir Goldsworthy Gurney was the\r\nprototype of several others which entered upon regular and successful\r\nservice between various English cities, and which are said to have\r\nmaintained an average speed of about 12 miles and a maximum speed of\r\na little over 20 miles an hour. The above figure reproduced from a\r\ncontemporary lithograph shows the carriage that operated between London\r\nand Bath. It weighed about 2 tons and carried six inside and 12 outside\r\npassengers.]\r\n\r\nIt appears, then, that the idea of an automobile travelling on an\r\nordinary highway preceded that of the locomotive railway. It was,\r\nindeed, by far the more natural idea of the two, since tramways were at\r\nthat time but little used outside of collieries. And it seems scarcely\r\nopen to doubt that the repressive legislation was directly responsible\r\nfor deflecting the progress of mechanical invention away from what\r\nseemed the more natural direction of development. It is always\r\nhazardous in such a case to attempt to guess what might-have-been under\r\ndifferent circumstances; but considering the practical results already\r\nachieved as early as 1824, one can scarcely avoid the conviction\r\nthat had legislation favored, instead of opposing, the inventor, the\r\nautomobile might have been developed in Great Britain as rapidly as\r\nrailway traffic; in which event the middle of the nineteenth century\r\nwould have seen the world at least as near the horseless age as we are\r\nin reality at the close of the first decade of the twentieth century.\r\nWhat this would have meant in its economic bearings on civilization\r\nduring the past fifty years, the least imaginative reader can in some\r\nmeasure picture for himself.\r\n\r\nIn opposition to this view it might be urged that the real progress\r\nof the automobile has taken place since 1885, when the Daimler oil\r\nengine was substituted for the steam engine in connection with motor\r\nvehicles. But in reply to this it must be remembered that the workable\r\ngas engine had been invented as early as 1860, and that the Otto\r\nengine, of which the Daimler is a modification, was patented as early\r\nas 1876. These developments, it will be noted, took place at just about\r\nthe time when the new interest in the automobile had been aroused,\r\nas evidenced by the repressive British legislation just referred\r\nto. It can be but little in question that had the early interest in\r\nthe British automobile been maintained, inventive genius would long\r\nsince have provided a suitable motor. There was no incentive for the\r\nEnglish inventor during those long years when the automobile was under\r\nlegislative ban; and in the meantime the idea of the highway automobile\r\nseems not to have taken possession of other nations.\r\n\r\nWhen that idea did make its way, it was very soon put into tangible\r\noperation, as everybody knows. And the fact that England made no\r\nprogress whatever in this line until the repressive laws were repealed\r\nin 1896, whereas France, Germany, and America had leaped far ahead in\r\nthe meantime, is in itself demonstrative. Moreover, as regards the\r\nquestion of a motor for the automobile, it should not be forgotten\r\nthat the steam-engine is by no means obsolete. The victories of Mr.\r\nRoss' machine at Ormonde in 1905, and of the Stanley steamer in 1906\r\n(a mile in 28-1/5 seconds), show that steam is distinctly a factor,\r\nnotwithstanding the popularity of the gasoline engine. The steam motor\r\nmight have served an admirable purpose until such time as a better\r\npower had been developed.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is futile to dwell on might-have-beens. Let us rather\r\nconsider for a moment the spectacular development of the automobile\r\nwith particular reference to its striking capacities as an eliminator\r\nof space.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCIENTIFIC ASPECTS OF AUTOMOBILE RACING\r\n\r\nA mile in 34-1/5 seconds. That is the automobile record established\r\nat Ormonde Beach in January, 1905. The record mile was made by Mr.\r\nH. L. Bowden, of Boston, with a machine of peculiar construction. It\r\nconsisted essentially of two four-cylinder motors adjusted to one\r\nmachine, giving an engine of 120 horse-power. The machine weighed\r\n2,650 pounds, exceeding thus by more than four hundred pounds the\r\nusually prescribed limits of weight. The record, therefore, stood\r\nas a performance in a class by itself. But that is something that\r\ninterests only the specialist. For the general public it suffices that\r\nan automobile propelled by a gasoline engine covered a mile in 34-1/5\r\nseconds, or at the rate of one hundred and five miles an hour.\r\n\r\nThis record was made on Wednesday, January 25, 1905. A little\r\nearlier on the same day the previous automobile record of a mile in\r\nthirty-nine seconds--made at Ormonde by Mr. William K. Vanderbilt,\r\nJr., in 1904--had been twice broken; first by Mr. Louis Ross, who made\r\nthe mile in his 40 horse-power steam auto of \"freak\" construction\r\nin thirty-eight seconds; and by Mr. Arthur McDonald, driving a 90\r\nhorse-power car belonging to Mr. S. F. Edge. Mr. McDonald's record was\r\na mile in 34-2/5 seconds, and this stood for a time as the new record\r\nfor cars of regulation weight.\r\n\r\nIt thus appears that Mr. Vanderbilt's record was reduced first by\r\none second, then by 4-1/5 seconds, and finally by 4-2/5 seconds on\r\nthe same day. Obviously the conditions were peculiarly favorable on\r\nthat day, or else a very marked improvement in the construction of\r\nracing automobiles had taken place within a single year. The latter is\r\ndoubtless the true explanation, since, according to all reports, the\r\nconditions at Ormonde Beach that year were not peculiarly favorable,\r\nbut rather the reverse. The fact, too, that the five mile record was\r\nreduced to the low figure of three minutes seventeen seconds--this also\r\nby Mr. Arthur McDonald--on the day preceding that on which the mile\r\nrecord was so completely smashed, corroborates the idea of improved\r\nmechanism rather than improved conditions. In any event, the jump from\r\n39 to 34-1/5 seconds is a notable one; as will be evident from a simple\r\ncomputation which shows that the record holders of 1905 would have run\r\naway from the champion of 1904 at the rate of no less than nineteen\r\nfeet for each second of the mile.\r\n\r\nLet us pass at once--omitting transition stages--from these records to\r\nthe new mark set on March 16th, 1910, at Ormonde Beach by Mr. Barney\r\nOldfield. Driving a Benz automobile of two hundred horse-power, he\r\ncompassed the mile in 27.33 seconds. The new record has a peculiar\r\ninterest, not merely because it is the fastest mile ever made by an\r\nautomobile, but because it is in all probability the fastest mile\r\never travelled by a human being who lived to tell the tale. A few\r\nunfortunates, falling from balloons, or from mountain cliffs, may have\r\npassed through space at a yet more appalling speed; but they lost\r\nconsciousness, never to regain it, long before the mile was compassed.\r\nThe automobile driver retains his senses throughout his breakneck\r\nmile--they are keenly on the alert indeed--and comes away unscathed to\r\ntell the story of what must be a truly thrilling experience.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A RACING AUTOMOBILE.\r\n\r\nIn this 200-horse-power Benz car Barney Oldfield reduced the world's\r\nmile record to 27. 33 seconds--a speed of 131.72 miles an hour--and the\r\ntwo-mile record to 55.87 seconds. The mile record was made at Ormonde\r\nBeach, Florida, March 16, 1910; the two-mile record at the same place a\r\nfew days later.]\r\n\r\nNor is it merely in contrast with other human experiences that the new\r\nperformance takes on \"record\" proportions. It is at least doubtful\r\nwhether any member of the animal kingdom ever passed through a mile of\r\nspace at such a speed as that attained by Mr. Oldfield. The fastest\r\nquadruped on the globe is almost unquestionably the thoroughbred\r\nhorse. But the fastest mile ever compassed by a horse--Salvator's\r\nstraightway dash in 1:35½--is a snail's pace in comparison with Mr.\r\nOldfield's speed. Salvator covered a little over fifty-five feet per\r\nsecond; the racing motor covered a trifle over 193 feet--thus gaining\r\n138 feet in each second.\r\n\r\nThe trotting horse at its best--a mile in 1:58½--is of course much\r\nslower still; Lou Dillon's record mile being made at the rate of 44½\r\nfeet per second. Dan Patch, the swiftest pacer, in his mile in 1:56\r\nmade just one foot per second more than the trotter. Both pacer and\r\ntrotter, it should be added, made their records with the aid of a\r\nwind-shield, without which their best performances are some seconds\r\nslower.\r\n\r\nIf we make comparisons with different varieties of man-made records,\r\nwe find that the swiftest human runner covers his mile at the rate of\r\nabout twenty-one feet per second; the skater brings this up to about\r\nthirty-four feet; and the bicyclist attains the acme of muscle-motor\r\nspeed with his eighty feet per second. In the case of the bicyclist,\r\nthe wind-shield pace-maker on the auto-cycle plays an important part.\r\nBut even so the cyclist would be left behind one hundred and thirteen\r\nfeet each second by the flying automobile.\r\n\r\nAll these types of record maker, therefore, are quite outclassed. If we\r\ncould not find any real competition for the automobile in the animate\r\nworld, we must seek it in bird-land. Here, it might be supposed, the\r\nspace devourer would find a match. But it is not quite certain that\r\nsuch is the case. The old-time books on natural history tell us,\r\nto be sure, of flight speeds that make the new records seem slow.\r\nThey credited the European swift, for example, with two hundred and\r\nfifty miles an hour. But more recent observers, made cautious by the\r\nscientific spirit of our age, are disposed to discredit such estimates,\r\nwhich confessedly are little better than guesses.\r\n\r\nThe only officially timed bird flights are the flights of homing\r\npigeons; and here the record credits the homing bird with only one\r\nhundred miles an hour. This means 124 feet a second, as against the\r\nmotor's 193. According to these figures, the automobile could give the\r\npigeon a start of almost two thousand feet and yet sweep forward and\r\novertake it in its flight, before it passed the mile-post. Perhaps the\r\ncomparison is not quite fair, since no doubt the pigeon may perform\r\nsome individual miles of its journey at more than the average speed;\r\nbut it may well be doubted whether its maximum ever reaches the\r\nmile-rate of 27.33 seconds.\r\n\r\nIt is within the possibilities, however, that some other birds have\r\neven surpassed this speed. The falcon, for example, is probably a\r\nswifter bird than the pigeon, at least for short distances. Some one\r\nindeed has credited the hawks with a speed of one hundred and fifty\r\nmiles an hour. But this, I feel sure, is a great exaggeration. I once\r\nsaw a hen harrier pursue a prairie-chicken, without seeming to gain\r\nappreciably for a long distance; yet the prairie-chicken is by no means\r\namong the speediest of birds. Many of our ducks, for example, quite\r\noutclass it; indeed I should be disposed to admit that the teal or the\r\ncanvasback at full speed might give the automobile a race.\r\n\r\nThere is, to be sure, one way in which the bird might get the better of\r\na machine, thanks to its capacity to rise to a height. This would be\r\nby taking a sloping course downward. The little shore-lark often gives\r\nan exhibition of the possibilities open to the bird in this direction.\r\nAfter rising to a cloudlike height it soars about for a time singing,\r\nthen suddenly sweeps downward, and, closing its wings, launches itself\r\ndirectly toward the earth, falling with meteoric speed till it almost\r\nreaches the surface, when it makes a parachute of its wings and swoops\r\naway in safety. During this performance the little lark is, I veritably\r\nbelieve, the swiftest-moving animate thing in all the world. But there\r\nis a reason why the bird could not increase its speed indefinitely by\r\nimitating the lark's feat in a modified form, and this is the obstacle\r\nof atmospheric pressure. Air moving at the rate of sixty feet a second\r\nconstitutes a serious storm; at ninety feet it becomes a tornado, and\r\nat one hundred and fifty feet it is a tornado at its worst--a storm\r\nthat tears up trees and overthrows houses, and against which no man can\r\nstand any more than that he could breast the current of Niagara. Now,\r\nof course, it is all one whether the air moves at this rate against you\r\nor whether you move at a corresponding rate against the air--action\r\nand reaction being equal. Therefore a very serious check is put upon\r\nthe bird's flight; and it is this consideration which makes it seem\r\ndoubtful whether any bird, except when aided by a strong wind, can\r\nattain such speeds as have been suggested.\r\n\r\nOf course, atmospheric pressure affects the automobile no less than the\r\nbird. In record-breaking speed tests of the automobile, machine and\r\ndriver are in effect subjected to the influence of a veritable tornado.\r\nTheoretically it seems almost incredible that any power could drive a\r\nton of metal against the air at such a speed; practically we see the\r\nfeat accomplished. But the automobilist has tales to tell of the power\r\nof the wind against his face that are easily credible. Even at ordinary\r\nspeed in a touring-car, as most of us can testify, the wind blows a\r\ngale, veritably forcing tears from the eyes of the novice and blowing\r\nthem back over his ears. To modify the antagonism of the wind, the\r\nconstructors of racing motor cars adopt a model suggested originally by\r\nthe body of a bird or of a fish, and long since made familiar by the\r\nshipbuilder.\r\n\r\n\r\nA MIRACULOUS TRANSFORMATION OF ENERGY\r\n\r\nMost of the automobiles, as everybody is aware, are propelled by\r\ngasoline engines. This is not their least wonderful feature. To the\r\nordinary observer it seems quite incredible that a little whiff of air\r\nmixed with the fumes of a few drops of gasoline should produce a power\r\nthat can drive pistons with such force as to throw forward what is\r\nvirtually a bullet weighing more than a ton.\r\n\r\nThe power that propels this amazing projectile consisted in the\r\naggregate of a few cubic feet of gaseous vapors. The forward motion\r\nof the piston sucked a whiff of the gasoline vapor and air into the\r\ncylinder; the backward motion of the piston compressed this gas; an\r\nelectric spark ignited it; the heat of the electric spark enabled the\r\ngasoline molecules to unite with the oxygen molecules with explosive\r\nsuddenness; the conflagration thus started spread instantly to other\r\nparts of the compressed gas; the myriad particles of the gas rebounding\r\nfrom one another at inconceivable speed, pressed with the aggregate\r\npower of multitudes upon the cylinder, and drove it back with terrific\r\nforce; then an escape valve opened; the return thrust of the piston\r\ndrove out the exploded gas, and one revolution of the engine was\r\ncomplete.\r\n\r\nOver and over again this cycle was repeated; each revolution requiring\r\nfor its performance but a bare fraction of the time required to\r\ndescribe it. The thing is simple enough in practice, but it is a\r\nmarvelous mechanism when you stop to think of it. That such power\r\nshould be latent in a seemingly harmless whiff of gas is one of\r\nNature's miracles. And that man should have constructed an engine so\r\nnicely adjusted in all its parts as to utilize this power is little\r\nless than a miracle of mechanics.\r\n\r\nA word should be said about another interesting mechanism that pertains\r\nnot indeed to the speed of the automobile, but to an accurate record\r\nof that speed. That is an electrical timing-device with which absolute\r\naccuracy of timing is assured. A moment's reflection will show that it\r\nwould be quite impossible to time the automobile moving at record speed\r\nby the old stop-watch method. The nervous impulse through which the\r\nmandate of the brain is conveyed to the hand, and thus made to operate\r\non the stop-watch, travels along the nerve of the arm at the rate of\r\nnot much more than a hundred feet a second. The delay thus involved,\r\nadded to the time required for the brain itself to act on the message\r\nfrom the eye, is distinctly appreciable, and every one is aware that\r\nindividuals differ as to their reaction time.\r\n\r\nThe practical result, therefore, is that timers are often at variance\r\nto the extent of as much as two-fifths of a second. Now in two-fifths\r\nof a second, as we have seen, the record motor car covers a distance\r\nof over 77 feet. Obviously such latitude in measurement could not be\r\npermitted. Hence an electric device has been elaborated which tests the\r\nspeed with absolute accuracy, recording it automatically on a strip of\r\ntape. Therefore the fractional seconds are now stated in hundredths\r\ninstead of in mere quarters or fifths, and we may be confident--as we\r\ncould not always be regarding the old-time records--that the different\r\nfractions of a second represent an actual difference of speed.\r\n\r\nIt may be of interest to make a further comparison between the speed of\r\nthe record automobile and the fastest speed ever attained by a railway\r\nlocomotive--namely, a mile in thirty seconds. The gap is by no means an\r\ninsignificant one. A mile in thirty seconds means 176 feet a second.\r\nThis would allow the champion automobile a lead of over seventeen\r\nfeet each second; and at the end of a mile the locomotive would be\r\ndistanced by 1040 feet. It is interesting to visualize the procession\r\nthat the automobile would leave behind if placed in competition with\r\nthe various kinds of champions whose feats have been mentioned. As the\r\nautomobile crossed the line the locomotive would be almost one-fifth\r\nof a mile in the rear; 1,900 feet farther back would come the homing\r\npigeon; after a long gap Salvator, the first runner, would come\r\nstraggling along, having covered little more than one-fourth of a mile;\r\nLou Dillon would be just beyond her first fifth of a mile; the fastest\r\ncyclist would be placed between the racer and the trotter; while\r\nHutchins, the swiftest runner at the distance, would have gone only 240\r\nyards from the tape.\r\n\r\nFor distances greater than two miles, the locomotive record has not\r\nas yet been surpassed by the automobile. A locomotive on the Plant\r\nsystem, for example, is credited with a run of five miles in two and\r\none-half minutes (in 1901). But, of course, there is nothing except the\r\nmere matter of speed that makes the locomotive engineer's performance\r\ncomparable to that of the chauffeur. The engineer is driving a machine\r\nthat runs on a fixed track. He has to do little more than keep up\r\nsteam and open the throttle. The chauffeur must pick his course, for\r\nat any moment a soft spot in the sand may tend to deflect him. How\r\nappalling may be the result of a slight deflection with a machine going\r\nat great speed has been illustrated by the tragic accidents that have\r\nmarred the success of many important racing-events, and have led to\r\nthe oft-repeated question as to whether, after all, such speed tests\r\nare worth while. It is a question that everyone must answer for\r\nhimself. The dangers are obvious; but, on the other hand, most athletic\r\ncompetitions have an element of danger; and enthusiasts may well\r\ncontend that speed tests make for progress, and are largely responsible\r\nfor the great mechanical improvement that is in evidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nTHE DEVELOPMENT OF ELECTRIC RAILWAYS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe United States has been preëminent in the development of street\r\nrailways of all kinds, from the earliest type of horse-car to the\r\nmodern city and interurban electric cars. Nevertheless, very few of\r\nthe great general underlying principles upon which these numerous\r\ninventions are based have been discovered upon this side of the\r\nAtlantic. American inventors have simply excelled in applying the known\r\ngeneral principles to practical mechanisms. But although the American\r\ninventors have largely monopolized this field of progress, the names of\r\nmany Europeans also are connected with it. In several instances these\r\nforeign inventors, as naturalized American citizens, have done their\r\nwork in America, being attracted to this country by the exceptional\r\nopportunities offered.\r\n\r\nIn recent years the city of New York has not shown conspicuous activity\r\nin adopting innovations and improvements on its street-railway lines.\r\nNevertheless, New York was the first city in the world to have a\r\npassenger street railway. This, built in the early 20's, and running\r\nalong Fourth Avenue, had rails made of straps of iron laid on stone\r\nties. On this primitive line an omnibus horse-car, called the _John\r\nMason_, was operated. This car was built on the lines of the early\r\nrailway carriages, having three compartments, with doors opening at the\r\nsides. It was, in short, an early type of the side-door cars now used\r\nso universally on all European railways. The driver's seat was high in\r\nthe air as in the case of the ordinary omnibus, and there were seats on\r\nthe top for passengers.\r\n\r\nFor several years this primitive road remained the only street railway\r\nin existence. But it did not prove a particularly good business\r\nventure, and for some time capitalists were wary of investing their\r\nmoney for the construction of other lines. Twenty years later, however,\r\na somewhat similar road, considerably improved, was built on Sixth\r\nAvenue. This proved to be a financial success; other lines were soon\r\nconstructed, and the era of street railways opened.\r\n\r\nThe great advantage of these horse-car lines over the system of\r\nomnibuses then in use lay in the fact that greater loads could be\r\nhauled with the same expenditure of horse-power, regardless of weather\r\nconditions. The contrast in this respect was particularly marked in\r\nAmerican cities where the streets, almost without exception, were badly\r\npaved.\r\n\r\nBy 1850, several cities in the United States had installed street\r\nrailways; and by 1870 over a hundred lines had been built. Between 1870\r\nand 1890 this number had been increased to over seven hundred, not\r\ntaking into account the numerous extensions that had been made to many\r\nof the older lines.\r\n\r\n\r\nCABLE SYSTEMS\r\n\r\nEven in the early days of street-railway construction the extravagance\r\nof the method of horse-power traction was fully appreciated, and the\r\nnumerous improvements in steam-engines stimulated attempts to adapt\r\nthe locomotive in some form to city railways. But there were many\r\ndifficulties in the use of the ordinary, or specially constructed,\r\nlocomotives in the crowded thoroughfares of the larger cities. It was\r\npractically impossible to eliminate their smoke; and their puffing and\r\nwheezing, which frightened horses, caused numerous accidents. But even\r\nif these defects could be corrected, the locomotive was known to be an\r\nexpensive form of motive power, when applied to a single short car,\r\ncarrying at most only a few passengers and making frequent stops, as\r\nwas necessary in street-car traffic. The inventors, therefore, looked\r\nabout for other methods of applying steam power. But it was not until\r\n1873 that this idea took the practical form of the cable road, on which\r\nsingle cars could be operated by means of underground cables travelling\r\nin slotted tubes, and propelled from a stationary power-plant.\r\n\r\nThe first practical cable system was made by Andrew S. Hallidie, and\r\nhis associates, who planned and put into operation the first cable\r\nline in San Francisco. It proved to be entirely successful, and was\r\nimitated almost immediately in most of the larger cities of the United\r\nStates, and in some European cities. Within a decade the number of\r\ncable railways installed had so reduced the number of horses necessary\r\nfor operating street-car lines all over the country that there was an\r\nappreciable depression in the market prices of such horses.\r\n\r\nThe importance of this method of transportation is shown in the fact\r\nthat between the years 1873 and 1890 more than a thousand different\r\npatents directly connected with the operation of cable roads were\r\nissued by the United States Patent Office. But by 1890 electric\r\ntraction had become practical, and the issuing of patents for cable\r\nlines ceased as abruptly as it had begun. Before the close of the\r\ncentury practically every important cable line in the United States had\r\nchanged its motive power to electricity. Thus in a brief quarter of a\r\ncentury this method of street-car traction had come into existence,\r\nrevolutionized all hitherto known methods, and become obsolete.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY SELF-CONTAINED SYSTEMS\r\n\r\nIn most of the earlier attempts to solve the problem of electrical\r\npropulsion the motor vehicles were constructed on a self-contained\r\nplan--that is, the power was generated on the locomotive itself,\r\njust as in the case of the steam locomotive. As early as 1835 Thomas\r\nDavenport, a blacksmith of Brandon, Vermont, constructed such a motor\r\noperated by cells, and built a small circular railway in Springfield,\r\nMassachusetts, on which he drove this electro-magnetic engine. This\r\nminiature railroad was of no practical importance, but it has the\r\ndistinction of being the pioneer electric road.\r\n\r\nShortly after this, Prof. Moses G. Farmer, a distinguished American\r\ninventor and investigator, constructed an electro-magnetic locomotive,\r\nwhich drew a little car, and carried passengers, on a track a foot\r\nand a half wide. The locomotive used about fifty Grove cells, which\r\ndeveloped a relatively small amount of energy at an enormous cost.\r\n\r\n\"In 1850-51,\" says Martin, \"Mr. Thomas Hall, of Boston, exhibited a\r\nsmall working-motor on a track forty feet long, at the Mechanics'\r\nCharitable Fair in Boston, and while this was a mere toy, and used\r\nbut a couple of cells of battery, it sufficed to illustrate the\r\nprinciples of a motor or locomotive with a single trial car. About this\r\ntime (1847) an interesting demonstration was also made with a small\r\nworking-model, one of the features of which has been most instrumental\r\nin the success of the modern electric methods, that of the utilization\r\nof the track as part of the return circuit for the current. Doctor\r\nColton, once a famous dentist in New York City, and noted for his early\r\napplication of laughing-gas in that work, was associated with Mr. Lilly\r\nin the construction and operation of a small model locomotive which ran\r\naround a circular track. The rails were insulated from each other, each\r\nconnecting with one pole of the battery. The current from the battery\r\nwas taken up by the wheels, whence it passed to the magnets, upon whose\r\nalternating attraction and repulsion motion depended; then it returned\r\nto the other rail, connected the other pole of the battery, and thus\r\ncompleted the circuit necessary for the flow of the current. In like\r\nmanner in a great majority in use at present, the current passes from\r\none power-house to circuits of one polarity, through the trolley pole\r\nto the motor or electro-magnetic propelling system, thence through the\r\nwheels to the track, which completes the circuit by being connected to\r\nthe other pole or side of the dynamo at the power-house. The principles\r\nare obviously identical, but it took more than a quarter of a century\r\nto develop the proper method of application in all its details.\r\n\r\n\"The most serious and sustained attempt in the early period to\r\noperate a self-sustained vehicle or car--which would correspond\r\nwith the storage-battery cars--was that due to Prof. C. C. Page,\r\nof the Smithsonian Institution. About 1850, Professor Page devoted\r\nconsiderable time to the development of electric engines or motors, in\r\nwhich the reciprocating action of a system of magnets and solenoids\r\nor armatures was applied by crank-shafts to driving a fly-wheel, to\r\nwhich rotary motion was thus imparted. This reciprocal motion, as\r\nin steam-engines, was one of the prevailing features of the early\r\nelectric-motor work in this country and in Europe; but it was not long\r\nbefore its general inapplicability was realized, and it was abandoned\r\nfor the simpler and more direct rotation of the armature before or\r\nbetween the poles of electro-magnets.\r\n\r\n\"On April 29, 1857, with an electric locomotive on which he had\r\ninstalled a large reciprocating motor developing over 16 horse-power,\r\nProfessor Page made a trial trip along the track of the Washington\r\nand Baltimore Railroad, starting from Washington. In order to obtain\r\ncurrent for energization, the motor was equipped with one hundred\r\ncells of Grove nitric-acid battery, each having as one element a\r\nplatinum plate eleven inches square, dipped in the acid. Bladensburg,\r\na distance of about five and one-quarter miles, was reached in\r\nthirty-nine minutes, and a maximum speed of nineteen miles an hour was\r\nattained; the entire trip to and from Bladensburg occupied one hour\r\nand fifty-eight minutes. But many disasters happened to the batteries.\r\nSome of the cells cracked wide open, and jolts due to inequalities of\r\ntrack threw the batteries out of working order. These experiments must\r\nhave been extremely costly, and no little discouragement among people\r\nin general attended this failure; but Professor Page was not daunted,\r\nand for some years continued his work on electric motors, displaying\r\ngreat ingenuity, but not able, apparently, to give up the reciprocating\r\nprinciple.\"\r\n\r\nThe invention of the commercial dynamo, shortly after the middle of\r\nthe nineteenth century, opened the era of practical electric-railway\r\nconstruction on both sides of the Atlantic. The German experimenters,\r\nSiemens and Halske, and later the American, Stephen D. Field, paved the\r\nway by numerous experiments and discoveries. It was not until about\r\n1880, however, that the idea of using a third rail for transmitting the\r\ncurrent was conceived. Hitherto, most of the inventors had attempted to\r\nuse one rail as a receiving part of the circuit to the motor, the other\r\nrail completing the return part of the circuit. And it was several\r\nyears after the idea of the third rail had germinated before the\r\nattempts to utilize one of the traction rails for conveying the current\r\nwas abandoned.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EDISON ELECTRIC LOCOMOTIVE\r\n\r\nIn 1880, Mr. Thomas A. Edison, at Menlo Park, New Jersey, perfected a\r\nseries of electric-railway motors and locomotives that were actually\r\nemployed in hauling freight and passengers. The following year Mr.\r\nEdison made a contract with Mr. Henry Villard, which stipulated that\r\nthe inventor was to construct an electric railway at least two miles\r\nand a half in length, which was to be equipped with two locomotives\r\nand three cars, one locomotive for freight and one for passengers, the\r\npassenger locomotive to have a capacity of sixty miles an hour. It\r\nwas agreed that if the experiment with this railway proved successful\r\nMr. Villard was to reimburse Mr. Edison for the actual outlay, and to\r\ninstall at least fifty miles of electric road in the wheat regions of\r\nthe Northwest.\r\n\r\nThe electric locomotives built by Mr. Edison were constructed along the\r\nusual lines of steam locomotives, with cab, headlight, and cowcatcher,\r\nthe motive power being applied from the motors to the axle by means\r\nof friction pulleys. This method was soon abandoned, as the pulleys\r\nslipped a great deal before the locomotive actually started. A system\r\nof belts which was substituted proved more satisfactory. The current\r\nwas conveyed to the motor through the track, and was supplied to\r\nthe road by underground cables connecting from the dynamo-room of\r\nMr. Edison's laboratory. The rails were insulated from the ties by\r\ncoatings of Japan varnish, and by placing them on pads made of muslin\r\nimpregnated with tar.\r\n\r\nFrom the very first this road gave promise of success. The tireless\r\ngenius of Edison was constantly finding and correcting defects,\r\nand there was every prospect that in a few months a practical and\r\neconomical electric railway would be an accomplished fact. Then came\r\nthe financial crash of the Northern Pacific Railway, involving the\r\nfortune of Mr. Villard, and tying the hands of the inventor at Menlo\r\nPark for the time being.\r\n\r\nThe year following, however, Mr. Field and Mr. Edison combined their\r\nforces and formed a company for perfecting and constructing electric\r\nlocomotives and railways. In the same year an electric railway was put\r\nin operation at the Chicago Railway Exposition, the chief promoters of\r\nthis enterprise being Messrs. Field, F. B. Rae, and C. O. Mailloux. In\r\nthe gallery of the building a circular track, something like a third\r\nof a mile in length, was laid, and on this an electric locomotive\r\nnamed _The Judge_ hauled a single car which carried over twenty-six\r\nthousand passengers in the month of June. In the autumn of the same\r\nyear, _The Judge_ was used for hauling passengers on a track at the\r\nLouisville Exposition. It was capable of attaining a speed of twelve\r\nmiles an hour, and its average speed was eight miles. It was twelve\r\nfeet long over all, weighed something like three tons, and, like\r\nEdison's locomotive, was equipped with cowcatcher, headlight, and cab.\r\nThe current was taken from a surface, or feed rail, by means of bundles\r\nof phosphor-bronze wire, so arranged that a good clean contact would\r\nbe made on each side of the rail whether the car was moving forward or\r\nbackward.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIRD RAILS AND TROLLEYS\r\n\r\nAt the same time an Englishman named Leo Daft, then living in America,\r\nwas making some important experiments with motors for the purpose\r\nof driving machinery, these motors being operated from central\r\npower-stations located at distant points. Mr. Daft constructed an\r\nelectric locomotive, and in November, 1883, constructed what was known\r\nas the Saratoga and Mount MacGregor Railroad. This railroad was twelve\r\nmiles in length and included many steep grades. The locomotive, which\r\nhauled a regular passenger-car, received the current from a central\r\nrail. The year following Mr. Daft built and equipped a small road on\r\none of the long piers of Coney Island, which carried something like\r\nforty thousand passengers in one season. It was an improvement over\r\nthe Siemens electric railway established in Germany in 1881--which,\r\nhowever, was the first road ever established.\r\n\r\nThe following year the inventor began the equipment of the Baltimore\r\nUnion Passenger Railway Company, a line that ran a distance of about\r\ntwo miles and reached an elevation of one hundred and fifty feet\r\nabove the city of Baltimore. This road was put into regular operation\r\nin 1886, and was the second electric street railway in America for\r\ncarrying on regular passenger service.\r\n\r\nThe Baltimore Union Railway had several novel and important features,\r\none of them being the equipment of part of the line with an\r\noverhead-trolley service, the practical importance of which had been\r\ndemonstrated shortly before by Van Depoele. The projector, Mr. Daft,\r\nalso built several other lines in different parts of the country,\r\nconstantly improving upon his earlier efforts, sometimes using two\r\noverhead trolley wires, with two trolley contacts, thus doing away with\r\nthe use of the track as a means of current supply, or for use as part\r\nof the circuit. Although in recent years double overhead trolleys have\r\nlargely disappeared, some of them are still in use both in America and\r\nin Europe.\r\n\r\nVan Depoele was a Belgian who had come to America in 1869. Although\r\nprimarily a cabinet-maker, he had a great liking for the study of\r\nelectricity, and devoted all his spare time and money to efforts to\r\nsolve the problem of practical street-car propulsion. In 1883, at the\r\nIndustrial Exposition at Chicago, he operated a car by electricity,\r\nusing an overhead-trolley system somewhat similar to Daft's. By 1885,\r\nhe had made sufficient progress to construct a line one mile long for\r\ncarrying passengers from the railway station to the Annual Exhibition\r\ngrounds at Toronto, Canada. On a single track he operated three cars\r\nand a motor, carrying an average of ten thousand passengers daily,\r\nhis train sometimes attaining a speed of thirty miles an hour. For\r\nreceiving the current he used an underrunning trolley and pole very\r\nsimilar to the form now in common use, this being one of the first\r\ninstances of employing this particular method of receiving the current.\r\nIn this system an insulated track was used for returning the current.\r\n\r\nVan Depoele's next venture was the equipment of an electric railway\r\nat South Bend, Indiana, on which five separate cars were operated at\r\none time--a thing supposed by many to be impossible. The cars of this\r\nroad were equipped with motors placed under the cars instead of above\r\nthem, thus saving valuable seating-space. In place of the underrunning\r\ntrolley and pole, however, the current was taken from the overhead\r\nwire by means of a flexible cable. Later Van Depoele invented an\r\nunderrunning trolley and pole, taking out the original patents. His\r\nclaims to priority were contested eventually, but they were sustained\r\nby the United States courts.\r\n\r\nAt this time there were at least a score of inventors whose work added\r\nsomething of importance to the solution of the problem of electric\r\ntraction. But without belittling others, it is probably only justice\r\nto say that the work of Frank J. Sprague, a one-time lieutenant in\r\nthe United States Navy, marks the beginning of the modern era of\r\nstreet railways. In 1888, after a period of struggle and a series of\r\ndisheartening disasters, Mr. Sprague and his associates opened an\r\nelectric line for the Union Passenger Railway of Richmond, Va., which\r\n\"forms a landmark in the history of this industrial development.\" Over\r\na line of road with grades at that time considered impossible, thirty\r\ncars were put into use at the same time, the contract for the equipment\r\ncalling for its completion in ninety days. The success of this\r\nenterprise, when on the opening day more electric cars were operated\r\nthan in all the rest of America together, settled forever the question\r\nof the practicality of electric street railways, as well as many of\r\nthe questions of the practical application of the current, thanks to\r\nSprague's inventive genius.\r\n\r\nThis road was an overhead trolley-wire system, with an underrunning\r\ntrolley held in place by the now-familiar trolley pole. The number\r\nof difficulties that had to be solved in perfecting this apparently\r\nsimple piece of apparatus is shown by the statement of Mr. Sprague that\r\n\"probably not less than fifty modifications of trolley wheels and poles\r\nwere used before what is known as the 'universal movement' type was\r\nadopted.\"\r\n\r\nIn this connection the origin of the word \"trolley\" is interesting. It\r\nseems to have been corrupted from the word \"troller\" by the workmen of\r\na Kansas City car-line. On this line an overhead wire was used, the\r\ntravelling carriage taking the current from the wire being known as\r\nthe \"troller.\" The employees of the road, however, shortly corrupted\r\n\"troller\" into \"trolley\"; and \"trolley\" it has remained ever since.\r\n\r\nAs in the case of Van Depoele, whose perfection of the underrunning\r\ntrolley was contested legally, Sprague's great contribution to electric\r\ntraction, the suspension of the motor directly upon the axle, had\r\nfinally to be sustained by the United States courts. Sprague's method\r\nwas to hang the motor under the car directly upon the axle, by an\r\nextension or solid bearing attached directly to the motor. This plan\r\nof constructing the motor, together with numerous other improvements,\r\nprincipally in the direction of lightness, simplicity, and\r\nadaptability, soon superseded all pre-existing methods of construction.\r\nThus Van Depoele's method of taking the current from the wire, and\r\nSprague's method of utilizing it in the propulsion of the car, must be\r\nregarded as epoch-marking steps in the history of electric traction.\r\nSprague's invention demonstrated the validity of his contention, now\r\nuniversally accepted, that motors should be placed under each car\r\ninstead of being used on locomotives.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTORAGE-BATTERY SYSTEMS\r\n\r\nFrom the earliest attempts at solving the question of electric\r\ntraction, efforts were made to produce some form of storage battery\r\nwhereby the cars might be made independent of a distant generating\r\nplant. The advantages of a self-contained vehicle are so obvious that\r\nit is not surprising to find the inventors persistent in their attempts\r\nat producing practical cars of this type. Such battery cars would not\r\nrequire the dangerous, expensive, and cumbrous system of overhead\r\nwires, or the more sightly but also more expensive system of conduits.\r\nWith such a system of cars the elaborate mains and feeders for bringing\r\nthe current to the track from the power-house, and for effecting the\r\nreturn circuit, could be dispensed with. Moreover, the independent\r\naction of such cars over a system where the power is furnished from a\r\nsingle source, where the stoppage of the current stops every car along\r\nthe line, is inestimable.\r\n\r\nBetween the years 1880 and 1883 many storage-battery cars were built\r\nand put in service both in European and American cities. Probably the\r\nmost important one of these lines was that which was built by the\r\nBelgian, Mr. E. Julien, in New York city, in 1887-8. On the Fourth\r\nAvenue road something like a dozen storage-battery cars were put in\r\noperation for a considerable time, and later, improved modifications\r\nof these cars were operated in Philadelphia under the direction of Mr.\r\nAnthony Rackenzaun, of Vienna. But despite the apparent simplicity of\r\nthe storage-battery idea, innumerable difficulties were perpetually\r\npresenting themselves in its practical application. Despite the\r\ndisheartening results, however, storage-battery cars were not entirely\r\nabandoned in practice until 1903, New York city being the last to\r\nsurrender, as it had been about the last to adopt them.\r\n\r\nBut in February, 1910, the storage-battery street car again made\r\nits appearance on trial in New York--not the old heavy type of\r\nunsatisfactory car, but an entirely new and lighter creation of Thomas\r\nA. Edison, who had been striving for years to solve the storage-battery\r\nproblem. This car, which had been tested on the Orange, New Jersey,\r\nstreet-car line on January 20th, 1910, maintained a speed of fifteen\r\nmiles an hour in actual practice, and ran a distance of about one\r\nhundred and fifty miles without re-charging the batteries.\r\n\r\nThere are some novel features about the car itself, but the\r\nall-important one is the peculiar and novel storage battery which it\r\nhas taken Mr. Edison some nine years to perfect. In an imperfect form\r\nthis battery was given a trial in 1903, and much was expected of it\r\nbecause it was not only lighter than the usual form of storage battery,\r\nbut it promised more permanency because an alkali was used in place of\r\nan acid as an electrolyte.\r\n\r\nIn this battery the positive element, which consisted of nickel oxide\r\ninterspersed with layers of graphite, was packed in perforated nickel\r\ntubes. The negative element was iron oxide, with potassium hydrate as\r\nthe electrolyte. This battery showed no bad effects from over-charging\r\nor from being rapidly discharged, but it was found that the graphite\r\nsoon became oxidized and interfered with the working of the battery.\r\nThis defect was corrected by substituting chemically pure nickel for\r\nthe graphite, but another was soon discovered. Under the pressure\r\nof the oxide of nickel the square tubes containing the nickel were\r\nfrequently injured so that the powdered nickel oxide was sifted down on\r\nthe pure nickel layers and insulated them.\r\n\r\nThe only solution of this difficulty seemed to be to pack the nickel\r\nin strong round tubes four inches long and about the size of a lead\r\npencil, the sides of the tubes being finely perforated. But the expense\r\nof producing such tubes by ordinary methods was prohibitive. A machine\r\nwas finally invented, however, which made the tubes economically\r\nby using spirally wound ribbons of metal, the edges being fastened\r\ntogether during the coiling process. By the use of these tubes the\r\nbattery was so far perfected that it was given extensive trials in\r\n1908 on electric vehicles; and as these tests proved satisfactory,\r\nMr. Edison began the construction of a specially designed street\r\ncar equipped with two 5-horse-power 110-volt motors of very light\r\nconstruction. The car weighs complete about five tons, and the\r\nbatteries are stored under the seats running along each side.\r\n\r\nThis car was tested continuously for three weeks on one of the New\r\nYork cross-town lines and performed its work so satisfactorily and\r\neconomically that the management of the line decided to give the\r\nsystem a permanent trial. The regular daily run of this car averaged\r\nsomething over sixty-six miles, but this by no means exhausted the\r\ncapacity of the batteries; and it is estimated that it could easily\r\nhave run at least one-quarter farther without re-charging. The\r\nsurprising feature of these tests was the low cost of running. The\r\ntotal cost of electric power for the day's run was about thirty cents,\r\nor 4.3 mills for each mile. The ordinary New York street car costs on\r\nan average about five cents per mile for electrical energy; but on the\r\nother hand, the carrying capacity of these cars is almost twice that of\r\nthe Edison car.\r\n\r\nThe actual cost of running the car, however, was only one of its many\r\nadvantages. The fact that no underground conduits have to be laid\r\nor overhead wires erected and maintained makes the initial cost of\r\ninstalling the line far less than by any other system. The reduction in\r\nthe cost of maintenance of the line is also an important item, as it is\r\nestimated that the cost of repairs on conduit lines is about $15,000\r\nannually per mile.\r\n\r\nBut the most convincing proof that Mr. Edison has really produced a\r\npractical storage battery car lies in the fact that, after testing his\r\ncar for three weeks in actual traffic, the managers of the street-car\r\nline ordered sixteen similar cars for operation over their road.\r\n\r\n\r\nMONORAIL SYSTEMS\r\n\r\nThe introduction of electricity facilitated the construction of\r\nmonorail systems of roads, which had long been the dream of railroad\r\nconstructors, since this power could be applied with so much more\r\nflexibility. The defects of the parallel rail system are apparent both\r\nin construction of the roadbed and the operating of trains. It is\r\nalmost impossible to lay and maintain the rails in exact parallels,\r\nand even more difficult to keep each rail at the proper height at all\r\npoints. Both these factors enter very largely into the determination\r\nof the speed that a train can make over such tracks, any very\r\ngreat variation from the parallel causing derailment, while slight\r\ndepressions or elevations of either rail cause violent and dangerous\r\nrocking of the cars travelling at high speed.\r\n\r\nIn any monorail system the first of these difficulties, the deviation\r\nof the rail from the parallel, is, of course, eliminated; and it is\r\nfound that on a single rail the elevations and depressions are not\r\nserious obstacles. Moreover, the cost of construction of a single-rail\r\ntrack must obviously be less than for a double-rail track, and the\r\npower necessary to operate cars over such a track far less. But until\r\nthe invention of the gyrocar (which is referred to at length in the\r\nfollowing chapter) the methods of balancing the car on a single rail\r\npresented difficulties which quite offset the advantages of the\r\nmonorail system. Some of these methods are unique and a few of them are\r\npractical in actual operation.\r\n\r\nIn Germany a suspension monorail system is in operation, the cars being\r\nsuspended from an overhead track. But obviously such a system, which\r\nrequires elaborate and expensive steel trestle-work along every fork of\r\nthe road, is not adapted to the use of long-distance roads except in\r\nthickly populated districts. A less expensive and highly satisfactory\r\nsystem is the one invented by Mr. Howard Hansel Tunis and used at the\r\nJamestown Exhibition in 1907.\r\n\r\nIn this system the wheels, arranged in tandem, have double flanges\r\nwhich keep them on the single-rail track, and the cars are prevented\r\nfrom toppling over by overhead guides. These guides must be supported\r\non a frame-work, but as there is little tendency to sway on a\r\nsingle-rail track, they can be relatively light structures. It is the\r\ncost of these frames, however, that practically offsets the low cost\r\nof road-bed construction, so that, everything considered, the mere\r\nmatter of initial cost has no very great advantage over the ordinary\r\ndouble-rail road. But the cost of operating is considerably less than\r\nthe older type, and this road would undoubtedly come rapidly into\r\npopularity but for the fact that such gyrocars as the ones invented\r\nin England and Germany are self-sustaining on the rail, doing away\r\nwith the expensive overhead frame-work construction, and are likely to\r\nbecome practical factors in the problem of transportation.\r\n\r\nIn 1909 an electric aerial monorail up the Wetterhorn in the Alps was\r\nput into operation. On this line a car suspended on two cables, one\r\nabove the other and without supports except at the upper and lower\r\nterminals, rises at an angle of forty-five degrees through a distance\r\nof 1,250 feet. There are two sets of these cables, each carrying a car\r\nso arranged as to work in alternate directions simultaneously, this\r\ncounter-balancing effecting a great saving in power. The power-plant\r\nis located at the upper end of the ascent, and consists of winding\r\ndrums actuated by electricity which raise and lower the cars by means\r\nof cables. On the cars themselves, therefore, there is no power, but\r\neach car is equipped with brakes powerful enough to stop and hold it\r\nnotwithstanding the steepness of the incline.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing particularly novel in the principles involved in this\r\naerial road, but it is the first of its kind to be built for passenger\r\ntraffic. Similar less pretentious roads have been in use for freight\r\ntransportation for several years. But the success of this road means\r\nthe building of others on inaccessible mountain inclines where the\r\nlaying of ordinary roadbeds is out of the question, and the operating\r\nof cog roads too expensive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nTHE GYROCAR\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of May, 1907, Mr. Louis Brennan exhibited, at a _soirée_ of\r\nthe Royal Society in London, a remarkable piece of mechanism, which\r\nstirred the imagination of every beholder, and--next morning--as\r\nreported by the newspapers, aroused the amazed interest of the world.\r\nThis invention consists of a car run on a single rail, standing erect\r\nlike a bicycle when in motion; but, unlike the bicycle, being equally\r\nstable when at rest.\r\n\r\nIt is a car that could cross the gorge of Niagara on a tight-rope,\r\nlike Blondin himself, but with far greater security; a car that shows\r\nmany strange properties, seeming to defy not gravitation alone but the\r\nsimplest laws of motion. For example, if a weight is placed on one edge\r\nof the car that side rises higher instead of being lowered.\r\n\r\nIf you push against the side with your hand, the mysterious\r\ncreature--you feel that it must be endowed with life--is actually felt\r\nto push back as if resenting the affront.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, if the wind blows against the car, it veers over toward the\r\nwind. If the track on which it runs--consisting of an ordinary gas-pipe\r\nor of a cable of wire--is curved, even very sharply, the car follows\r\nthe curve without difficulty, and, in defiance of ordinary laws of\r\nmotion, actually leans inward as a bicycle rider leans under the same\r\ncircumstances, instead of being careened outward as one might expect.\r\n\r\nA curious mechanism, surely, this new car, with its four wheels set in\r\nline, bicycle fashion, running thus steadily. But strangest of all it\r\nseemed when it poised and stood perfectly still on its tight-rope, as\r\nno Blondin could ever do. As stably poised it stood there as if it had\r\ntwo rails beneath it instead of a single wire; and there was nothing\r\nabout it to suggest an explanation of the miracle, except that there\r\ncame from within the car the murmur of whirling wheels.\r\n\r\nThe mysterious wheels in question would be found, if we could look\r\nwithin the structure of the car, to be two in number, arranged quite\r\nclose together on each side of the centre of the car. They are two\r\nsmall fly-wheels, in closed cases, revolving in opposite directions,\r\neach propelled by an electric motor. These are the wonder-workers. They\r\nconstitute the two-lobed brain or, if you prefer, the double-chambered\r\nheart of the strange organism. All the world has learned to call them\r\ngyroscopes. The vehicle that they balance may conveniently be termed a\r\ngyrocar--a name that has the sanction of the inventor himself.\r\n\r\nLet it be understood once for all that a gyroscope is merely a body\r\nwhirling about an axis. A top such as every child plays with is a\r\ngyroscope; a hoop such as every child rolls is a gyroscope; the\r\nwheels of bicycles, carriages, or railway-cars are gyroscopes; and\r\nthe earth itself, whirling about its axis, is a gyroscope. You can\r\nmake a gyroscope of your own body if you choose to whirl about, like\r\na ballet-dancer. In a word, the gyroscope is the most common thing\r\nimaginable. Indeed, if I wished to startle the reader with a seeming\r\nparadox, I might say without transcending the bounds of truth that,\r\nin the last analysis, there is probably nothing known to us in the\r\nuniverse but an infinitude of gyroscopes--atoms and molecules at one\r\nend of the scale; planets and suns at the other--all are whirling\r\nbodies. Still there are gyroscopes and gyroscopes, as we shall see.\r\n\r\n\r\nGYROSCOPIC ACTION EXPLAINED\r\n\r\nNow a word about gyroscopic action. If you have rolled a hoop or spun a\r\ntop you have unwittingly learned some practical lessons on the subject\r\nwhich, had you possessed Mr. Brennan's imagination and ingenuity, might\r\nhave enabled you to anticipate him in the invention of the gyrocar.\r\nHarking back to the days when you rolled hoops, you will recall that\r\nthe child who most excelled in the art was the one that could make the\r\nhoop go fastest. The hoop itself might be merely a wheel of wire, which\r\nwould fall over instantly if not in motion; but if given a push it\r\nassumed an upright position and maintained it with security, so long as\r\nit was impelled forward. It seemed able, so long as it whirled about,\r\nto defy the ordinary laws of gravity. A bicycle in motion gives an even\r\nmore striking illustration of the same phenomenon. And best of all, a\r\nspinning-top. Everyone knows how this familiar toy, which topples over\r\ninstantly when at rest and can in no wise be balanced on its point,\r\nrises up triumphant when whirled about, and stands erect, poised in a\r\nway that would seem simply miraculous to all of us, had we not all\r\nspun tops at an age when the world was so full of wonders that we\r\nfailed to marvel at any of them.\r\n\r\nAll these familiar things illustrate one of the principles of\r\ngyroscopic action which Mr. Brennan has put to account in developing\r\nhis wonderful car--the fact, namely, that every revolving body tends\r\nto maintain its chief axis in a fixed direction, and resents--if I\r\nmay be permitted to use this expressive word--having that direction\r\nchanged. The same principle is illustrated on a stupendous scale by our\r\nrevolving earth, which maintains the same tilt year after year as it\r\nwhirls on its great journey, notwithstanding the fact that the sun and\r\nthe moon are tugging constantly at its protuberant equatorial region in\r\na way that would quickly change its direction if it were not spinning.\r\n\r\nBut note, please, that whereas the whirling body assumes a certain\r\nrigidity in space as regards the direction in which its axle points,\r\nthe mere translation of the body itself through space in any direction\r\nis not interfered with in the least, provided the axle is kept parallel\r\nwith its original position.\r\n\r\nYou may test this if you like in a very simple way. Remove one of the\r\nwheels of your bicycle, and carry it about the room, holding it by the\r\naxle while it is spinning rapidly. You will discover that it requires\r\nno more force to carry it when spinning than when at rest, provided you\r\ndo not attempt to tip it from its plane of rotation, but that if you do\r\nattempt so to tip it, the wheel seems positively to resist, exerting\r\na force of which it did not show a trace when at rest. A large top,\r\narranged within the kind of frames or hoops called gimbals, if you can\r\nsecure such a one, will show you the same phenomenon; it will resist\r\nhaving its axis diverted from the direction it chanced to have when it\r\nwas set spinning.\r\n\r\nIf you ask why the spinning wheel exerts this power, it may not be\r\neasy to give an answer. The simplest things are hardest to explain.\r\nNo man knows why and how gravitation acts; no one knows why a body at\r\nrest tends always to remain at rest until some force is applied to\r\nit; nor why when a body is once in motion it tends always to move on\r\nat the same rate of speed until some counter-force stops it. Such are\r\nthe observed facts; they are facts that underlie all the principles of\r\nmechanics; but they are matters of observation, not of explanation or\r\nargument. And the fact that a revolving body tends to maintain its axis\r\nin a fixed position is a fact of the same category.\r\n\r\nSo far as we can explain it at all, we may, perhaps, say that the\r\ninertia which the matter composing the wheel shares with all other\r\nmatter is accentuated by the fact that its whirling particles all tend\r\nat successive instants to fly in different directions under stress\r\nof centrifugal force. At any given instant each individual particle\r\ntending to fly off in a particular direction may be likened to a man\r\npulling at a rope in that direction.\r\n\r\nIf you imagine an infinite number of men circled about a pole to which\r\nropes are attached, and evenly distributed, each one pulling with\r\nequal force, it will be clear that the joint effort of the multitude\r\nwould result in fixing the pole rigidly at the centre. The harder the\r\nmultitude pulled, so long as they remained evenly distributed about\r\nthe circle, the more rigid the pole would become. But if, on the\r\nother hand, all the men were to stop pulling and slacken the ropes,\r\nthe pole would at once fall over. The pole, under such circumstances,\r\nwould represent the axis of the revolving wheel, which acquired\r\nincreased stability in exact proportion to the increased velocity of\r\nits revolutions, and therefore of the increased force with which its\r\nparticles tend to fly off into space.\r\n\r\nBut be the explanation what it may, the fact that the axis of a\r\nrevolving wheel acquires stability and tends to maintain its fixed\r\nposition in space is indisputable; and it is this fact which determines\r\nprimarily the action of the little revolving wheels of the gyroscopes\r\nthat balance Mr. Brennan's car. There are certain very important\r\nadditional principles involved that I shall refer to in a moment, but\r\nfirst let us glance at the car itself and see how the gyroscopes are\r\narranged. We shall find them fastened within the frame-work of the car,\r\nat its longitudinal centre, in such a way that their axles are parallel\r\nto the axles of the ordinary car-wheels when the car stands in a normal\r\nposition. Granted that the gyroscopes are thus transverse and normally\r\nhorizontal, and at right angles to the track, the exact location of the\r\nmechanism within the car is immaterial. But the two gyroscopes must\r\nrevolve in opposite directions for a reason to be given presently.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RETROSPECT AND PROSPECT IN TRANSPORTATION--THE DE WITT\r\nCLINTON TRAIN AND THE GYRO-CAR.\r\n\r\nThe De Witt Clinton engine, with its archaic coaches, represents the\r\nearliest type of railway transportation in America. The Gyro-car, two\r\nviews of which are given, is the working model of a single-rail vehicle\r\nexhibited in England by Mr. Louis Brennan in 1907. It is balanced by an\r\ningenious gyroscopic mechanism, which its inventor believes will prove\r\nequally successful when applied to vehicles on a commercial scale.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. BRENNAN'S MODEL CAR\r\n\r\nThe Brennan car as at first exhibited was only a working-model about\r\nsix feet in length, and the gyroscopes that balanced it were about\r\nfive inches in diameter. It seems almost incredible that wheels so\r\nsmall should be able to balance a car six feet in length, but it must\r\nbe understood that these small gyroscopes whirl at the rate of about\r\nseven thousand revolutions per minute, and, of course, the gyroscopic\r\nforce is proportionate to the rate of revolution. If we recall that a\r\nlight hoop making perhaps fifty or a hundred revolutions per minute\r\nacquires a considerable stability, we shall cease to wonder at the\r\nrigidity of the axles of the wheels revolving at such enormous speed.\r\n\r\nThe model car accomplished the feat of carrying a passenger weighing\r\nabout one hundred and forty pounds across a little valley on a wire\r\ncable, a voyage in some respects the most remarkable that any man has\r\nthus far been privileged to make. The car has shown that it can go up\r\nor down a sharp incline; but this, as a moment's reflection will show,\r\ndoes not involve any change of direction of the gyroscopic axle, and\r\ntherefore involves only the ordinary laws of mechanics. It is all one\r\nto the gyroscope whether the car moves on the level or up or down hill,\r\nso long as it moves straight ahead.\r\n\r\nNor do the gyroscopes interfere in the least with the turning of the\r\ncar in passing round a curve, when the two of them are linked together,\r\nas Mr. Brennan links them, so that any lateral change in the axis of\r\none is balanced by an opposite change of the axis of the other. With\r\nthe single gyroscope, such as Mr. Brennan used when he first began his\r\nexperiments, the car encounters difficulties at curves in the track.\r\n\r\nBut before we can understand how the two gyroscopes balance each other\r\nin such a way as to make the Brennan car lean in while passing about\r\na curve, we must investigate more fully the action of the individual\r\ngyroscopes. I have already said that there is another principle\r\ninvolved as supplementary to the principle of the fixed axis; this we\r\nmust now investigate.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it would be fairer to say that what we have to consider is\r\nnot a new principle but a complication as to the application of the\r\nprinciple of gyroscopic action already put forward. In any event there\r\nis an elementary fact about the gyroscope that I have not yet stated.\r\nIt is this: in order that the gyroscope may exercise its fundamental\r\nproperty of holding its axis fixed, it must have that axis so adjusted\r\nthat it is free to oscillate or wabble. That sounds distinctly\r\nparadoxical, but it is a very essential fact. If Mr. Brennan had merely\r\nfixed two wheels rigidly in the frame of his car, they would have had\r\nno appreciable effect in balancing it. Had nothing more than that been\r\nnecessary, some one would have invented a gyrocar long ago. But very\r\nmuch more than that was necessary, as we shall see.\r\n\r\nThe complication of which I am speaking is illustrated by the action\r\nof the simplest top, which likewise owes its stability to its wabble.\r\nYour top does not rise merely because it spins, but because it wabbles\r\nas it spins--wabbling being the familiar word for what the machinist\r\ncalls \"precession.\" A freely spinning top, if in equilibrium, has no\r\ninherency to rise up against gravitation, as your top may have led\r\nyou to suppose. Your top rises because it is not spinning freely in\r\nequilibrium, its action being interfered with by the friction of the\r\npoint on which it rests; it is seeking a position of equilibrium,\r\nwhich, owing to the location of its centre of gravity, will be found\r\nwhen its spindle is erect. But a top supported at both ends and\r\nproperly balanced, does not tend to rise but only to maintain its\r\nposition.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW THE BRENNAN GYROSCOPES WORK\r\n\r\nIt is such a balanced top as this that we must call to our aid in\r\nexplaining the action of Mr. Brennan's gyroscopes. The explanation will\r\ninvolve the use of a diagram perhaps rather unpleasantly suggestive of\r\nthe days when you studied geometry, and I fear I cannot hope to make\r\ninteresting reading of the explanation. But it will be worth your while\r\nto follow it, that you may understand the action of one of the most\r\nremarkable and ingenious of inventions. Figure 1 represents a kind of\r\ntop called a Foucault gyrostat. It is merely a top or gyroscope in\r\ngimbal frames, such as I have already referred to. With certain slight\r\nmodifications, the diagram that represents it might also be a diagram\r\nof one of the gyroscopes in Mr. Brennan's car. Indeed, it was such a\r\ntop as this that led Mr. Brennan to his discovery. Once while on a\r\nvisit to Cannes, he purchased a top like this of a street vender--and\r\nthe gyrocar is the outcome of the studies he made with it. This is also\r\nthe kind of top with which Foucault, after whom it is named, proved\r\nthat the earth revolves; but we shall come to that story in another\r\nconnection.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.]\r\n\r\nReverting to the diagram, the gyroscope or top proper is at the centre,\r\nrevolving on the axis _O A_. It is pivoted on the frame _B A C_,\r\nwhich frame is in turn pivoted so that it can rotate on the axis _B\r\nC_. Lastly, the outer frame _B D C E_ is pivoted on the axis _D E_.\r\nThus the apparatus as a whole is capable of revolving on each of its\r\nthree principal axes. But under ordinary conditions it is only the\r\ninner wheel that is spinning. As this wheel is perfectly balanced, it\r\nwill maintain steadily any position that it chances to have when it\r\nis set spinning, and the outer frames will remain stationary unless a\r\ndisturbing force is applied to them.\r\n\r\nSuppose, now, that the wheel has been set spinning on its axis _O A_ in\r\nthe direction indicated by the arrow, while its axis is horizontal, as\r\nrepresented in the diagram. The wheel will then tend to maintain its\r\nposition and resist any attempt to displace it. But its resistance will\r\nbe shown in a very peculiar way--whereby hangs our tale. If you apply a\r\nsteady downward pressure to the frame _B A C_ at point _A_, attempting\r\nthus to deflect the axis of the spinning wheel of the gyroscope, the\r\nframe will not tip down as you expect it to do (and as it would do if\r\nthe top were not spinning) but instead, it will move in a horizontal\r\nplane along the arc _C A B_, the entire mechanism rotating on the axis\r\n_D E_. This motion is equivalent to the wabble of the top, and it is\r\ncalled \"precession.\"\r\n\r\nPlease remember the word and its meaning, for we must use it repeatedly.\r\n\r\nBut now, curiously enough, if you were to apply a sidewise pressure at\r\n_A_, pushing to the left (as we view the diagram) to help on the motion\r\nof precession, the obstinate apparatus will cease altogether to move in\r\nthat direction and the point _A_ will begin to rise instead, the frame\r\n_B A C_ rotating on its axis _B C_. This rise of the axis _O A_ will\r\ntake place even though the downward pressure is continued. You have\r\ndisturbed the equilibrium of the top--unbalanced it--and it must seek a\r\nnew position. Contrariwise, if you would have the point A moved to the\r\nright, you must push it upward; if you would have it go down, you must\r\npush it to the right.\r\n\r\nThis seems rather weird behavior, but if you will note the direction\r\nof the arrow on the wheel you will see a certain method in it. It will\r\nappear that in each case the force you apply has been carried round\r\na corner, as it were, by the whirling disc, and made to act at right\r\nangles to the direction of its application. This change of direction\r\nof a force applied is strictly comparable to the change effected by\r\nthe familiar device known as a pulley. With that device, to be sure,\r\na pull instead of a push is used, but this is a distinction without a\r\ndifference, for pushing and pulling are only opposite views of the same\r\nthing.\r\n\r\nPossibly this suggested explanation of the action of the gyrostat may\r\nnot seem very satisfactory, but the facts are perfectly clear, and\r\nif you will bear them steadily in mind you will readily be able to\r\nunderstand the Brennan gyroscope, as you otherwise cannot possibly\r\nhope to do. You have only to recall that pushing down at _A_ causes\r\nmotion (called \"precession\") to the left, and pushing up at _A_, motion\r\nto the right; and that in order to make _A_ either rise or fall, you\r\nmust \"accelerate precession\" by pushing to the left or to the right,\r\nrespectively. But you must understand further, that when, through the\r\napplication of any of these disturbing forces, you have forced the axis\r\n_O A_ into a new position, it will tend to maintain that new position,\r\nhaving no propensity whatever to return to its original position. It is\r\nquite as stably in equilibrium with its axis pointing upward as when in\r\nthe position shown in the diagram. One position is quite like another\r\nto it; but having accepted a position it resents any change whatsoever.\r\n\r\nNow we are prepared to understand the Brennan gyroscope, which consists\r\nessentially of two such gyrostats as that shown in our diagram _A_, set\r\ninto the frame of the car on the axis _D E_, their wheels revolving\r\nin opposite directions and their outer frames so linked together that\r\nwhen one turns in one direction on its axis _D E_, the other must turn\r\nin the opposite direction. As the sole object of having two of the\r\ngyroscopes is to facilitate the going around curves, we may for the\r\nmoment neglect the second one, and consider the action of only one of\r\nthe pair.\r\n\r\nOur diagram 2, then, will represent one of Mr. Brennan's gyroscopes\r\nin action. It is pivoted into the framework of the car on the axis _D\r\nE_. If you examine it you will see that it is essentially the Foucault\r\ngyrostat of our other diagram, with the axis _O A_ projected beyond the\r\nframe to the point _F_.\r\n\r\nIn practice, the frame _B A C_ is made to carry the field-magnet of\r\nan electric motor for spinning the wheel. But this in no wise affects\r\nthe principles of action. Mr. Brennan's invention consists of the\r\nexceedingly ingenious way in which he applies these principles; and\r\nto understand this we must follow our diagram closely. Looking at it,\r\nyou will see that the spindle _O F_ carries two rollers _R1_ and _R2_\r\nwhich may come in contact under certain circumstances with the curved\r\nsegment marked _G1_, _G2_, _G3_, _G4_, which are strong segments of\r\nthe car-frame itself--the segments, indeed, upon which the force\r\nof the gyroscope is expended in holding the car in equilibrium. It\r\nmust be understood further that the roller _R1_ is loosely fitted to\r\nthe spindle _O F_ and hence can whirl with it when pressed against\r\nthe segment _G1_ or _G3_; whereas the roller _R2_ is fitted about a\r\nnon-revolving extension of the frame _B A C_, and not to the spindle\r\nitself. Bearing in mind that the gyroscope itself is perfectly balanced\r\nand hence tends to maintain its axis _O F_ in a fixed direction, we\r\nshall be able to understand what must happen when the car is tipped\r\nfrom any cause whatever--as the shifting of its load, the pressure of\r\nthe wind, or the centrifugal action due to rounding a curve.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.]\r\n\r\nSuppose, for example, that the car tips to the right. This will bring\r\nthe segment _G1_ in contact with the roller _R1_, and the roller will\r\ninstantly tend to run along it, as a car-wheel runs along the track,\r\nbecause friction with the spindle causes it to revolve. But this, it\r\nwill be evident, is equivalent to pushing the spindle _F_ (or the frame\r\n_A_) toward _B_--\"accelerating the precession\"--and we know that the\r\neffect of such a push will be to cause the spindle (thanks to that\r\nround-the-corner action) to rise, thus pushing up the segment _G1_, and\r\nwith it the car itself.\r\n\r\nThe thrust will cause the car to topple to the left and this will free\r\nthe roller _R2_, but a moment later it will bring the segment _G2_ in\r\ncontact with roller _R2_ which thus receives an upward thrust. But an\r\nupward thrust, we recall, will not cause the spindle to move upward,\r\nbut off to the right toward _C_; and so, a moment later still the\r\nroller _R2_ will pass beyond the end of the segment _G2_ and the roller\r\n_R1_ will come in contact with the segment _G3_, along which it will\r\ntend to roll, thus accelerating the precession to the right, and so\r\ncausing the spindle to push downward, bringing the car back to its old\r\nposition or beyond it; whereupon the segment _G4_ will be brought in\r\ncontact with _R2_, retarding the further oscillation of the car and\r\ncausing the spindle to move back again to the left.\r\n\r\nThis sequence of oscillations will be repeated over and over so long\r\nas any disturbing force tends to throw the car out of equilibrium. In\r\nother words, the gyroscope, when its balance is disturbed by a thrust\r\ndue to any unbalancing of the car, will begin to wabble and continue\r\nto wabble until it finds a position where it is no longer disturbed,\r\nand this new position will be attained only when the car as a whole is\r\nperfectly balanced again.\r\n\r\nIn this new position of balance, the car (owing to a shift of its load\r\nor to the force of the wind) may be tipped far over to one side, as\r\na man leans in carrying a weight on one shoulder, to get the centre\r\nof gravity over the rail, and in that event the axis of the gyroscope\r\nwill be no longer horizontal. But that is quite immaterial. There is\r\nno more merit in the horizontal position than in any other, as regards\r\nthe tendency to keep a fixed axis. If it is usually horizontal, this is\r\nonly because under normal conditions the car will be balanced at its\r\nphysical centre, just as ordinarily a man stands erect and does not\r\nlean to one side in walking.\r\n\r\nReverting for a moment to our diagram and the explanation just given,\r\nit will be understood that the two rollers R1 and R2 are never in\r\naction at the same time, and that it is only the roller R1 that gives\r\nthe sidewise push that accelerates the precession (since R2 is not in\r\ncontact with the axle itself).\r\n\r\nThe function of R2 is to retard the precession and bring the axis\r\nto its normal position at right angles to the rail on which the car\r\nruns. There is nothing of mystery about the action of either which the\r\naction of our gyrostat does not explain, but the mechanism by which the\r\ndifferent segments of the car are made to push against the spindle, and\r\nso force it to balance the car in order that it may maintain its own\r\nbalance, is exceedingly ingenious. Mr. Brennan himself tells me that he\r\nhas improved methods of accomplishing these results, which are not yet\r\nto be made public. The principle, however, is the same as that outlined\r\nin the earlier patents which I have just described.\r\n\r\nIf you have taken the trouble to follow carefully the description just\r\ngiven, you will be prepared to understand the anomalies of action of\r\nthe gyrocar; for example, why its side rises when a weight is placed\r\non it; why it leans toward the wind, and why it leans to the inner and\r\nnot to the outer side of the track in rounding a curve. The substance\r\nof the explanation is that the greater the force brought to bear on\r\nthe roller R1 by the segment of the car that strikes against it, the\r\nstronger its precession, and hence the more powerful its lift. The\r\noscillations and counter-oscillations thus brought about continue to\r\noperate powerfully on the roller R1 so long as the weight of the car is\r\nout of balance; and balance is restored only when the heavier side of\r\nthe car rises, bringing the centre of gravity over the track, just as a\r\nman carrying a weight on the right shoulder leans toward the left, and\r\nvice-versa. Thus, when the gyrocar has a heavy weight on one side, or\r\nencounters a strong wind, it may lean far over, but still be perfectly\r\nand securely balanced, the gyroscopes finally remaining quiescent in\r\ntheir new position until some new disturbance is applied.\r\n\r\nIt remains to be said, however, that there is another element\r\nintroduced when the car rounds a curve. To understand this, we must\r\nrevert to the action of the Foucault gyrostat, as illustrated in\r\ndiagram 1. If you held such a gyrostat in your hand in the upright\r\nposition in which it is shown in the diagram, and whirled it about, the\r\naxis _O A_ would of course maintain a fixed direction so long as the\r\ngyrostat was free to revolve on the axis _D E_. But if you prevented\r\nsuch revolution, as by clutching the spindle _E_ firmly, and then\r\nwhirled the gyrostat about at arm's length, the axis _O A_ would at\r\nonce be forced to take an upright position. If your hand whirled to\r\nthe right, the point _A_ would rise; if your hand whirled to the left,\r\nthe point _A_ would go down; the principle determining this motion in\r\neither case being that the direction of whirl of the gyroscope must\r\ncorrespond to the direction of curve given to the apparatus as a whole\r\nby the motion of your arm.\r\n\r\nExactly the same principle applies to the Brennan gyroscope when the\r\ncar to which it is attached goes about a curve. The frame pivoted at\r\n_D E_ revolves only within a limited arc, and then becomes fixed, and\r\nso the axis _O F_ tends to tip upward when the car rounds a curve. If\r\nonly a single gyroscope were used, this would tend to make the car tip\r\nin opposite directions, according to whether the car is going forward\r\nor backward, and the tip might be dangerous in going about a curve, as\r\nMr. Brennan found to his cost in his earlier experiments. But when the\r\ntwo gyroscopes, revolving in opposite directions, are linked together,\r\nthe action of one balances that of the other, and their joint effect is\r\nalways to make the car lean in at a curve, which is precisely what it\r\nshould do to ensure safety. Moreover, the two linked gyroscopes keep\r\ntheir planes of revolution parallel to the rail, as is essential to\r\ntheir proper action, and as a single gyroscope would not do.\r\n\r\nThe balancing action of the gyroscope seems no whit less remarkable\r\nafter it is explained. It should be said, however, that the force\r\nexerted by the mechanism is not so tremendous as might at first\r\nthought appear, for the gyroscopes are by no means called upon to\r\ncounteract the entire force of gravity brought to bear on the car.\r\nThey do not in any sense _lift_ the car; they only balance its two\r\nsides, which when left to themselves are approximately of equal\r\nweight. The car, as a whole, weighs down on the track just as heavily\r\nwith the gyroscopes in action as when they are still. Balancing is a\r\nvery different feat from lifting, as everyone is aware from personal\r\nexperience. Two men pushing against the opposite sides of a monorail\r\ncar could keep it balanced on the central rail though its weight vastly\r\nexceeded anything they could lift.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EVOLUTION OF AN IDEA\r\n\r\nIt goes without saying that so elaborate a mechanism as Mr. Brennan's\r\ngyroscope was not perfected in a day. Neither was it hit upon by\r\naccident. It belongs in the category of inventions that were thought\r\nout to meet a mechanical need. Mr. Brennan is an Irishman by birth,\r\nbut he was taken by his parents to Australia at the age of nine and\r\nremained there throughout the years of his early manhood. Observation\r\nof the condition of the roads in Australia, and of the enormous\r\nretardation of development due to inadequate transportation facilities\r\nled him to ponder over the possibilities of improvement in this\r\ndirection, as he was jolted about the country in a coach with leather\r\nstraps in lieu of springs. It became clear to him that a way must be\r\nfound to build railroads more cheaply. Furthermore, it was brought to\r\nhis attention through observation of the condition of the cattle that\r\nwere shipped from North Australia across the continent, that a railway\r\ncar that would enable the cattle to make the journey in comfort, and\r\nthus arrive in marketable condition, would have enormous value for this\r\npurpose alone.\r\n\r\nFor years, Mr. Brennan tells me, the problem haunted him, of how\r\nto make a monorail car balance itself. He studied the action of\r\nrope-walkers, and he attempted various crude methods of balancing a\r\ncar, which all came to nothing. He thought about the possibility of\r\nusing the gyroscope, and even purchased several elaborate gyrostats in\r\norder to study gyroscopic action. As a friend of Sir Henry Bessemer, he\r\nknew of that gentleman's experiments with the gyroscope in attempting\r\nto make a steady room in a ship, but these also availed him nothing. It\r\nwas not until he purchased the toy top at Cannes, as already mentioned,\r\nthat he got hold of a really viable idea; and then, of course, almost\r\nnumberless experiments were necessary before an apparatus was devised\r\nthat could meet all the requirements.\r\n\r\nAt last, however, a model car, more than fulfilling all his fondest\r\nhopes, was in actual operation. It remained to build a car of\r\ncommercial size. To aid him in thus completing his experiments,\r\nMr. Brennan received a grant of $30,000 from the India Society. He\r\nbelieved that a car one hundred feet long and sixteen feet wide would\r\nbe balanced by gyroscopes three and a half feet in diameter, so\r\neffectively that it would stand erect and rigid though fifty passengers\r\nwere clustered on one side of its spacious room.\r\n\r\nThe accuracy of this prediction was put to the test in November, 1909,\r\nwhen Mr. Brennan exhibited the first gyrocar of commercial size. The\r\nresult was demonstrative and convincing. The large car, carrying forty\r\nor fifty passengers, operated exactly as its inventor had foretold,\r\nand the doubts of the most skeptical were set at rest. Photographs of\r\nthe car in actual operation, with its load of passengers, were sent\r\nbroadcast, and it became apparent that the introduction of the gyrocar\r\nin competition with railway, trolley, and motor cars of the old type\r\nwould be only a matter of time.\r\n\r\nWhen we come thus to consider the gyrocar as a vehicle in which all\r\nof us may soon have an opportunity to ride, there is one practical\r\nquestion that is sure to present itself to the mind of almost every\r\nreader. What will be the effect should the electrical power that drives\r\nthe gyroscopes give out at a critical moment, as, for instance, when\r\nthe car is just crossing a gorge or river on a cable? Mr. Brennan's\r\ningenuity has anticipated this emergency. The gyroscopes that balance\r\nhis cars operate in a vacuum, and all the bearings are so well devised\r\nas to give very little friction. The wheels will continue running for\r\na considerable time after the power is shut off. The large gyroscopes\r\nof the commercial car, it is estimated, will perhaps require two hours\r\nto attain the highest rate of rotation, but they will then continue\r\nrevolving at an effective speed for some hours, even if no further\r\npower is applied to them.\r\n\r\nIt may be said, too, that the gyrocar is provided with lateral legs\r\nthat may be let down in case of emergency or when the car is not in\r\nuse, to avoid waste of energy in needless running of the gyroscope.\r\nAll in all, it would appear that the dangers of travel in a gyrocar\r\nshould be fewer than those that attend an ordinary double-track car;\r\nand Mr. Brennan believes that it will be possible, with the aid of the\r\nnew mechanism, to attain a speed of one hundred and fifty, perhaps even\r\ntwo hundred miles an hour with safety.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TWO VIEWS OF MR. LOUIS BRENNAN'S MONO-RAIL GYRO-CAR.\r\n\r\nThe gyroscopic mechanism for automatically balancing the car is\r\ncontained in the cab-like anterior portion. The platform of the car\r\nmaintains its equilibrium even when the forty passengers are crowded on\r\none side, as shown in the upper picture.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nTHE GYROSCOPE AND OCEAN TRAVEL\r\n\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that Mr. Louis Brennan's remarkable monorail\r\ncar affords the first illustration of an attempt to make practical use\r\nof the principles of gyroscopic action. The fact is quite otherwise.\r\nThe idea of giving steadiness to such instruments as telescopes and\r\ncompasses on shipboard with the aid of gyroscopes originated half a\r\ncentury ago, and was put into fairly successful operation by Professor\r\nPiazzi Smyth (in 1856). More than a century earlier than that (in\r\n1744), an effort was made to aid the navigator, by the use of a\r\nspinning-top with a polished upper surface, to give an artificial\r\nhorizon at sea, that observations might be made when the actual horizon\r\nwas hidden by clouds or fog. The inventor himself, Serson by name,\r\nwas sent out by the British Admiralty to test the apparatus, and was\r\nlost in the wreck of the ship _Victory_. His top seemed not to have\r\ncommended itself to his compatriots, but it has been in use more or\r\nless ever since, particularly among French navigators.\r\n\r\n\r\nBESSEMER'S COSTLY EXPERIMENT\r\n\r\nThese first attempts to use the gyroscope at sea were of a technical\r\ncharacter, and could have no great popular interest. But about\r\ntwenty-five years ago an attempt was made to utilize the principle of\r\nthe spinning-top in a way that would directly concern the personal\r\ncomfort of a large number of voyagers. It was nothing less than the\r\neffort to give stability to a room on a steamship, in order that the\r\nfortunate occupant might avoid the evils of seasickness. The man who\r\nstood sponsor for the idea, and who expended sums variously estimated\r\nat from fifty thousand to more than a million dollars in the futile\r\nattempt to carry it into execution, was the famous Sir Henry Bessemer,\r\nfamed for his revolutionary innovations in the steel industry. It would\r\nappear that Bessemer's first intention was to make a movable room to be\r\nbalanced by mechanisms worked by hand. But after his project was under\r\nway his attention was called to the possibility of utilizing gyroscopic\r\nforces to the same end. As the story goes, he chanced to purchase a top\r\nfor sixpence, and that small beginning led him ultimately to expend\r\nmore than a million dollars in playing with larger tops. His expensive\r\ntoy passed into history as the \"Bessemer chamber.\" It was actually\r\nconstructed on a Channel steamer; but the would-be inventor, practical\r\nengineer though he was, did not find a way properly to apply the\r\nprinciple, and his experiment ended in utter failure.\r\n\r\nWith this, the idea that the gyroscope-wheel could ever aid in\r\nsteadying a ship at sea seemed to be proved a mere vagary unworthy the\r\nattention of engineers. But not all experimenters were disheartened,\r\nand since the day of Sir Henry Bessemer's fiasco a number of workers\r\nhave given thought to the problem--with the object, however, of\r\napplying the powers of the revolving wheel not merely to a single\r\nroom but to an entire ship. I have personal knowledge of at least one\r\ninventor, quite unknown to fame, who believed that he had solved the\r\nproblem, but who died before he could put his invention to a practical\r\ntest. It remained for a German engineer, Dr. Otto Schlick, to put\r\nbefore the world, first as a theory and then as a demonstration, the\r\npractical utility of the revolving wheel in preventing a ship from\r\nrolling.\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. SCHLICK'S SUCCESSFUL EXPERIMENT\r\n\r\nIn the year 1904 Dr. Schlick elaborated his theory before the Society\r\nof Naval Architects in London. His paper aroused much interest in\r\ntechnical circles, but most of his hearers believed that it represented\r\na theory that would never be made a tangible reality. Fortunately,\r\nhowever, Dr. Schlick was enabled to make a practical test, by\r\nconstructing a wheel and installing it on a small ship--a torpedo-boat\r\ncalled the _Sea-bar_, discarded from the German navy. The vessel is one\r\nhundred and sixteen feet in length and of a little over fifty-six tons'\r\ndisplacement. The device employed consists of a fly-wheel one meter in\r\ndiameter, weighing just over eleven hundred pounds and operated by a\r\nturbine mechanism capable of giving it a maximum velocity of sixteen\r\nhundred revolutions per minute. This powerful fly-wheel was installed\r\nin the hull of the _Sea-bar_ on a vertical axis, whereas the Brennan\r\ngyroscope operates on a horizontal axis. So installed, the Schlick\r\ngyroscope does not interfere in the least with the steering or with\r\nthe ordinary progression of the ship. Its sole design is to prevent the\r\nship from rolling.\r\n\r\nThe expectations of its inventor were fully realized. On a certain day\r\nin July, 1906, with a sea so rough that the ship rolled through an\r\narc of thirty degrees, when the balance-wheel was not in revolution,\r\nthe arc of rolling was reduced to one degree when the great top was\r\nset spinning and its secondary bearings released. In other words, it\r\npractically abolished the rolling motion of the craft, causing its\r\ndecks to remain substantially level, while the ship as a whole heaved\r\nup and down with the waves. These remarkable results, with more in\r\nkind, were recorded in the paper which Sir William White read before\r\nthe Institution of Naval Architects in London in April, 1907. He\r\nhimself had witnessed tests of the Schlick gyroscope, and, in common\r\nwith his colleagues, he accepted the demonstrations as unequivocal.\r\n\r\nFully to understand the action of Dr. Schlick's invention, one must\r\nknow that it is not a mere wheel on the single pivot, but a wheel\r\nadjusted in such a fashion that it can oscillate longitudinally while\r\nrevolving on its vertical axis. In other words, it is precisely as\r\nif one of the two gyroscope-wheels used in the Brennan car (greatly\r\nenlarged) were so placed that its main axis was vertical, its secondary\r\naxis, or axis of oscillation, being horizontal and at right angles to\r\nthe ship's length. Thus, while spinning on its vertical axis the body\r\nof the top is able to oscillate, pendulum-like, lengthwise of the ship.\r\n\r\nIn principle the action of this wheel is not different from that of an\r\nordinary top on your table which wabbles to the right or to the left\r\nwhen you push its axis straight away from you. Yet to the untechnical\r\nobserver it seems as if the Schlick gyroscope were a living thing,\r\ngoverned by almost human motives. If you apply a brake to prevent the\r\nlongitudinal oscillations of the gyroscope, the effect, even though the\r\nfly-wheel still revolves at full speed, is precisely as if you pinioned\r\nthe arms of a strong man, so that he saw the futility of resistance\r\nand made no struggle to free himself. Under such circumstances the\r\ngyroscope--though it continues to spin as hard as ever--has no effect\r\nwhatever in preventing the rolling of the ship; it stands there, like\r\nthe strong man bound, expressing its discontent with an angry groan.\r\n\r\nBut if you release the brake so that the entire mechanism is free to\r\noscillate lengthwise of the ship, all is changed. It is as if you cut\r\nthe cords that bound the strong man's arms. Instantly the mechanism\r\nsprings into action. It will no longer allow itself to be swung with\r\neach roll of the ship; it will resist and prove which is master. Its\r\nmighty mass, pivoted on the lateral trunnions, lunges forward and\r\nbackward with terrific force, as if it would tear loose from its\r\nbearings and dash the entire ship into pieces. It causes the ship to\r\npitch a trifle fore and aft as it does so; but meantime its axis stands\r\nrigidly erect in the lateral plane, though the waves push against the\r\nsides of the ship as before. The decks of the vessel, that were tipping\r\nfrom side to side, so that loose objects slid from one rail to the\r\nother, are now held rigidly at a level, scarcely permitted to deviate\r\nto the extent of a violent tremor. The gyroscope has won the contest.\r\nTo maintain its victory it must continue its backward and forward\r\nplunging; but from side to side its axis will not swerve.\r\n\r\n\r\nDID GYROSCOPIC ACTION WRECK THE _VIPER_?\r\n\r\nIt was the failure to understand that a gyroscope-wheel, to work\r\neffectively, must be given opportunity to oscillate in this secondary\r\nfashion that led Sir Henry Bessemer to spend an enormous sum in a vain\r\neffort to accomplish on a small scale what Dr. Schlick's gyroscope\r\naccomplishes for the entire ship. Now it is clearly understood that\r\na marine gyroscope on an absolutely fixed shaft cannot exercise its\r\nfull action; but there is still a good deal of difference of opinion\r\namong engineers as to just how much a spinning body must be permitted\r\nto oscillate in order to make its gyroscopic effects noticeable. The\r\ndiscussion that has taken place over the loss of the torpedo-boat\r\n_Viper_ furnishes a case in point.\r\n\r\nSome critics contend that the loss of the boat was due to the\r\ngyroscopic action of its turbine engines. They believed that the\r\nturbine at the stern of the little ship held that portion of the craft\r\nin a rigid plane, while the anterior portion of the ship, caught in the\r\ntrough of a wave, broke away. That the ship broke in two is certain;\r\nbut competent engineers have denied that gyroscopic turbines could have\r\nhad any share in its destruction. According to their view, the turbines\r\nof a ship are powerless to exert the gyroscopic action in question,\r\nbecause their axes are fixed and they thus have not the opportunity for\r\nsecondary oscillation to which I have referred. Meanwhile there are\r\nother equally competent mechanicians who believe that the vibration\r\nor oscillation of the body of the ship itself may suffice, under\r\ncertain circumstances, to give the turbine precisely such freedom of\r\nmotion as will enable it to exercise a powerful gyroscopic effect.\r\nDr. Schlick himself contends, and seems with the aid of models to\r\ndemonstrate, that such a gyroscopic action is exercised by the wheels\r\nof a side-wheel steamer, which revolve on a shaft no less fixed than\r\nthat of a turbine. If such is the case, there would seem to be no\r\nreason why a turbine-engine may not at times exercise the power of a\r\ntremendous gyroscope, such as it obviously constitutes. The question\r\nmust find practical solution at the hands of the naval architects of\r\nthe immediate future, as turbine engines are now in use in several of\r\nthe largest steamships afloat, and others are being installed in craft\r\nof all descriptions.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHEORETICAL DANGERS OF THE GYROSCOPE\r\n\r\nIt should be said that engineers disagree as to the practical utility\r\nof the Schlick gyroscope. No one questions that it steadies the ship,\r\nbut some critics think that its use may not be unattended with danger.\r\nIt has been suggested that under certain circumstances--for example,\r\nthe sudden disturbance of equilibrium due to a tremendous wave--the\r\ngyroscope might increase the oscillation of the ship to a dangerous\r\nextent, though ordinarily having the opposite effect.\r\n\r\nThe danger from this source is probably remote. There is, however,\r\nanother danger that cannot be overlooked, and which marine architects\r\nmust take into constant account. What we have already seen has made\r\nit clear that the revolving wheel of the Schlick gyroscope, to be\r\neffective, must bear an appreciable relation to the mass of the entire\r\nship. Such a weight, revolving at a terrific speed and oscillating\r\nlike a tremendous pendulum, obviously represents an enormous store\r\nof energy. It was estimated by Professor Lambert that a gyroscope of\r\nsufficient size to render even a Channel steamer stable would represent\r\nenergy equal to fifty thousand foot-pounds--making it comparable,\r\ntherefore, to an enormous projectile. Should such a gyroscope in action\r\nbreak loose from its trunnions, it would go through the ship with all\r\nthe devastating effect of a monster cannon ball.\r\n\r\nThe possibility of such a catastrophe is perhaps the one thing that\r\nwill cause naval architects to go slowly in the adoption of the new\r\ndevice. We can hardly suppose that the difficulties represented are\r\ninsuperable, but undoubtedly a long series of experiments will be\r\nnecessary before the Schlick gyroscope will come into general use.\r\nThe apparatus has been tested, however, on a German coast steamer. It\r\nmay not be very long before craft of the size of Channel steamers and\r\nboats that go to Cuba and the Bermudas are equipped with the device.\r\nNaturally enough, this prospect excites the liveliest popular interest.\r\nVisions of pleasant ocean voyages come before the mind's eye of many a\r\nvoyager who hitherto has dreaded the sea.\r\n\r\nBut whatever the future of the gyroscope as applied to pleasure-craft,\r\nthere can be little doubt about its utility as applied to vessels of\r\nwar. It seems a safe enough prediction that all battle-ships will be\r\nsupplied with this mechanism in the not distant future. Amid the maze\r\nof engines of destruction on war-vessels, one more will not appal\r\nthe builder; while the advantage of being able to fling a storm of\r\nprojectiles from a stable deck must be inestimable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nNAVIGATING THE AIR\r\n\r\n\r\nIf it were possible to regard all medieval literature without more than\r\na grain of doubt, we must believe that aerial flight by human beings\r\nwas accomplished long before science had risen even to the dignity of\r\nacquiring its name. Thus, it is recorded by a medieval historian that\r\nduring the reign of Charlemagne some mysterious persons having acquired\r\nsome knowledge of aerostatics from the astrologers, who were credited\r\nwith numerous supernatural powers, constructed a flying-machine, and\r\ncompelling a few peasants to enter it, sent them off on an aerial\r\nvoyage. Unfortunately for the unwilling voyagers, so the story runs,\r\nthey landed in the city of Lyons, where they were immediately seized\r\nand condemned to death as sorcerers. But the wise bishop of the city,\r\ndoubting the story of their aerial journey, pardoned them and allowed\r\nthem to escape.\r\n\r\nThat such a fabulous tale could gain credence is explained by the\r\nprevailing belief in the powers of the astrologers and sorcerers at\r\nthat time. People who could seriously believe that an alchemist could\r\ncreate gold and prolong life and youth indefinitely, would find nothing\r\nstartling in the announcement that he could also perform the relatively\r\nsimple feat of flying--a thing that birds and bats accomplish with\r\nsuch obvious facility. And nothing is more certain than that attempts\r\nat aerial flight have been made at various times since the beginning of\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nAs with almost everything else in the matter of modern scientific\r\nadvancement, the mysterious writings of the monk, Roger Bacon, are\r\nsupposed to contain passages to show that the worthy friar had an\r\ninkling of the secret of air navigation. But he himself admits that he\r\nhad only a theoretical knowledge of the subject, and had never seen a\r\nflying-machine of any kind in actual flight.\r\n\r\nMuch more definite and tangible are the designs of possible\r\nflying-machines still extant in the sketch-book of Leonardo da Vinci,\r\nmade in the fifteenth century. From Leonardo's sketches it appears that\r\nthe artist had conceived the idea of constructing jointed wings to be\r\nworked with strings and pulleys, the motive power to be that of a man's\r\narms and legs. It appears also that later he had very definite ideas\r\nas to the possibilities of an aerial screw, and he is believed to have\r\nconstructed one of these screws made on the same general plan as that\r\nof the ordinary type of windmill in use at that time. But nothing of\r\npractical importance came of any of Leonardo's experiments.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that his abandonment of the project of flying by means\r\nof wings worked by muscular force was due to the discovery that the\r\nstrength of the muscles of even the strongest man was relatively slight\r\nas compared with the corresponding muscle of birds. Leonardo was\r\npeculiarly capable of discerning this discrepancy in strength, since\r\nhe himself was one of the strongest men of his time. It is said that\r\nhe could bend and straighten horseshoes with his hands. But in his\r\nexperiments with the aerial screw he probably discovered very soon that\r\neven such muscular force as he was capable of exerting was entirely\r\ninadequate; and there being no other mode of producing power at that\r\ntime, the idea of aerial navigation by this means was also abandoned.\r\n\r\nAbout this time some imaginative persons, realizing the possibilities\r\nof muscular development when begun in childhood and persistently\r\npracticed, attempted the development of a race of men whose abnormally\r\nstrong pectoral muscles would enable them to use artificial wings for\r\nflying. For this purpose a certain number of young boys were selected\r\nand constantly drilled in exercises of flapping the arms, to which\r\nbroad sails were attached. These attempts were persisted in for several\r\nyears, and it is said that some of these boys became so expert that by\r\nskipping along the surface of the ground and vigorously flapping their\r\nwing-attachments, they could travel at incredible speed, although never\r\nable actually to rise from the ground.\r\n\r\nIn 1678, a Frenchman named Besnier invented a flying-machine that is\r\ncredited with being more successful than any hitherto attempted. His\r\nmachine consisted of two bars of wood which were so hinged to a man's\r\nshoulders that they could be worked up and down by movements of the\r\nhands and feet. At the ends of these two bars were muslin wings made\r\nlike shutters, so arranged that they were opened by a downward stroke\r\nand closed automatically by a reverse motion. The general appearance\r\npresented by these wings was that of four book-covers fastened by\r\ntheir backs to the ends of the bars, opening and closing alternately as\r\nthe bars were worked up and down.\r\n\r\nThe inventor began his experiments in a modest way. His first attempt\r\nat flight was by jumping from a chair; next he tried a table; and\r\nfinally, emboldened by his success, he made flights from window-sills\r\nand even house-tops. On one occasion he is said to have sailed from\r\nhis attic window over the roof of a neighboring cottage, alighting,\r\nwithout injury, some distance beyond. It was even rumored at one time\r\nthat he would try to fly across the Seine, but if such a feat was ever\r\ncontemplated, it was never attempted.\r\n\r\nHalf a century later, however, the Marquis de Bacqueville actually made\r\nsuch an attempt with a machine somewhat similar to that of Besnier. The\r\nmarquis had practiced in private with his machine with such encouraging\r\nresults that he felt confident the feat was not an impossible one--in\r\nfact, that he was sure of accomplishing it. He therefore announced\r\npublicly that at a certain time the attempt would be made, and on the\r\nappointed day an immense crowd of people gathered on the banks of the\r\nriver to witness the spectacle. Starting from a building some little\r\ndistance away from the stream, the marquis made good progress at first,\r\nbut just as he reached the river-bank his machine collapsed and he was\r\ntumbled out, alighting on a barge moored at the edge of the stream.\r\nFortunately, the only injury he sustained was a broken leg; but this\r\nsingle attempt seems to have satisfied his aeronautic ambitions.\r\n\r\nUntil this time all attempts made at aerial flight had been those in\r\nimitation of birds; but during the early part of the eighteenth century\r\nthe idea of the balloon was developed. This was the result of the\r\nnumerous important discoveries made about that time as to the qualities\r\nof the atmosphere, and also several other \"airs,\" as gases were called,\r\nsuch as their expansion and contraction under different conditions of\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\nIn 1766 the English philosopher, Henry Cavendish, discovered that\r\nhydrogen gas has only about one-seventh the weight of an equal bulk\r\nof air, this scientific discovery pointing naturally to balloon\r\nconstruction, since obviously if such a light gas were confined in a\r\nsuitable receptacle, the device would rise to a certain height through\r\nthe heavier atmosphere, as a cork rises through water. At the same\r\ntime the experiments of the chemist, Dr. Joseph Black, and those of\r\nhis younger contemporary, Doctor Priestly, were directed along the\r\nsame lines, all of them pointing to the possibility of constructing an\r\naerostat with buoyancy and lifting-power, and Priestly's _Experiments\r\nRelating to the Different Kinds of Air_ is said to have been directly\r\nresponsible for stimulating the efforts of Stephen and Joseph\r\nMontgolfier, the French paper manufacturers, who finally invented and\r\nsent up the first balloon.\r\n\r\nEven before Montgolfier's invention, Tiberius Cavallo, an Italian\r\nliving in England, had demonstrated the possibility of making\r\ntoy-balloons. But the balloons of Cavallo were small affairs made\r\nof bladders or paper bags filled with hydrogen gas. One of these\r\nmaterials being too heavy and the other too porous for successful\r\nballoon construction, the performances of these toy-balloons were not\r\nconclusively demonstrative.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BALLOON INVENTED\r\n\r\nThroughout the entire spring of 1783, all Auvergne, in France, was kept\r\nin breathless expectancy by constant rumors that the two Montgolfiers\r\nhad really solved the problem of aerial flight, and would soon be seen\r\nsoaring over the country in a strange birdlike machine. Rumor pictured\r\nthis machine in various forms and sizes, but in point of fact there was\r\nreally very little secrecy on the part of the inventors themselves, who\r\nfrankly explained the principle of the balloon they were constructing.\r\nIt was hardly to be expected, however, that most persons would believe\r\nthe plain truth that so simple a device as a bag filled with hot air\r\nwould do what had long been considered impossible.\r\n\r\nSpring advanced and lapsed into summer, however, and as no\r\nflying-machine made its appearance, public clamor became so loud that\r\nthe Montgolfiers felt they could postpone their demonstration no\r\nlonger, although the balloon they were working on was not completed to\r\ntheir entire satisfaction. Nevertheless, they fixed on the definite\r\ndate of June 5, (1783) as the day and Annonay as the place for making\r\nthe trial, and their faith in their invention was shown by the fact\r\nthat special invitations were sent to the leading persons in the\r\nvicinity, and a general invitation extended to the world at large.\r\n\r\nBut in place of some complicated and birdlike machine, as rumor had\r\npictured the flying-machine, the multitude that gathered about the\r\nstarting-point found only an immense cloth bag about thirty-five feet\r\nin diameter, without machinery or wings, and capable of containing some\r\ntwenty-two thousand cubic feet of air, which the Montgolfier brothers\r\nand their assistants were inflating with heated air. As the bag filled,\r\none of the brothers announced with all seriousness, that as soon as it\r\nwas completely filled it would \"rise to the clouds,\" carrying with it a\r\nframe weighing some three hundred pounds.\r\n\r\nThis announcement was not received with the same seriousness with\r\nwhich it was given. The idea of expecting anyone to believe that an\r\nordinary cloth bag would fly excited the risibilities even of the\r\nmore serious members of the crowd. Nevertheless, as the great globe\r\nfilled it became evident to the spectators that it was tugging at the\r\nrestraining ropes in efforts to rise, in a most extraordinary manner;\r\nand when, at a signal from the inventors, the ropes were cast off and\r\nthe monster shot skyward, the crowd's smiles were turned to expressions\r\nof gaping astonishment. Straight into the air the monster mounted,\r\nand then, wafted by a gentle breeze, it continued to soar and rise\r\nuntil in ten minutes it had reached an altitude of six thousand feet,\r\nsailing easily in a horizontal direction for a short distance, then\r\ngradually descending and alighting some eight thousand feet from the\r\nstarting-point.\r\n\r\nThe news of this triumph travelled quickly to Paris, and the Parisians\r\nclamored to see the wonderful performance repeated in the capital. The\r\nking and court were as interested as the savants and the populace, and\r\nan order was sent at once by his Majesty, bidding the brothers bring\r\ntheir balloon to the city.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, however, a savant named Charles had started the\r\nconstruction of a balloon that was to be filled with hydrogen gas\r\ninstead of heated air. This was a much more expensive undertaking, as\r\na thousand pounds of iron filings and five hundred pounds of sulphuric\r\nacid were necessary to manufacture a sufficient quantity of gas to\r\nfill the varnished silk bag. But by the 23rd of August everything\r\nwas in readiness for the filling process, and the following day this\r\nfirst gas-balloon rose from the Champs de Mars to a distance of three\r\nthousand feet and disappeared into the clouds. Three-quarters of an\r\nhour later it descended in a field near the little village of Gonesse,\r\nto the great consternation of the inhabitants of the neighborhood,\r\nwho supposed it to be some monster bird, animal, or flying dragon.\r\nArming themselves with scythes and pitchforks, therefore, but keeping\r\nat a safe distance, the boldest of the peasants sallied out and\r\nsurrounded the field in which the creature had alighted. As it made no\r\noffensive movement, however, one bold huntsman armed with his trusty\r\nfowling-piece, crept cautiously within range and fired, tearing a\r\nhole in the monster's side and causing it to writhe and collapse,\r\ngiving off what appeared to be a foul-smelling, poisonous gas in its\r\ndeath-struggles. When finally it lay flat and still the villagers\r\nbecame emboldened, and rushing upon it cut and tore it to shreds,\r\nending the performance by tying the fragments to a horse's tail and\r\nsending the animal scurrying across the fields.\r\n\r\nIn anticipation of some such demonstration as this, the French\r\nGovernment had sent out a proclamation on the day of the ascent.\r\n\"Anyone who should see in the sky a globe, resembling the moon in an\r\neclipse,\" the proclamation ran, \"should be aware that far from being\r\nan alarming phenomenon, it is only a machine, made of taffeta, or\r\nlight canvas covered with paper, that cannot possibly cause any harm,\r\nand will some day prove serviceable to the wants of society.\" But\r\napparently none of the villagers of Gonesse had seen this proclamation.\r\n\r\nThe success of these balloon ascensions sent a wave of enthusiastic\r\ninterest in aeronautics all over France. The novelty and possibilities\r\nof ballooning appealed to the French temperament, just as the\r\npossibilities of submarine navigation and automobiling did a century\r\nlater. As a result, France became at once the centre of ballooning, the\r\nwhole nation being eagerly absorbed in the subject of navigating the\r\nair. In the theatre of action, the Montgolfiers continued to occupy the\r\ncentre of the stage, and at all times showed themselves worthy of the\r\nleading rôle. Pursuant to the order of the king, M. Montgolfier had\r\ncome to the capital, and on September 19th, before Louis XVI and his\r\nqueen and the court at Versailles, sent up another hot-air balloon, or\r\n\"Montgolfier,\" as this kind of balloon had come to be called.\r\n\r\nA novel and important feature of this exhibition, however, was the\r\nsubstitution of living animals for sand-bags or other ballast, as used\r\nheretofore. In a wicker cage a cock, a duck, and a sheep were fastened,\r\nand these were carried some fifteen hundred feet into the air,\r\ndescending uninjured, two miles from the starting-point, a few minutes\r\nlater. The cage was broken open in the descent, but its occupants\r\nescaped injury, and the sheep was found quietly grazing when the rescue\r\nparty arrived.\r\n\r\nThe successful voyage of these caged animals stimulated the balloonists\r\nto attempt the crucial test of sending up a balloon carrying a human\r\npassenger. But from this perilous undertaking the boldest spirits\r\nrecoiled, even the Montgolfiers refusing to venture. In those days,\r\nhowever, there was always a means of securing human beings, willing\r\nor otherwise, for any undertaking. Where gold would not tempt, it\r\nneeded but a word of the monarch to commute the death-sentence of some\r\ncriminal, placing him at the disposal of the scientists for a better\r\nor worse fate than the gallows, as the case might be. And so when\r\nLouis XVI heard of the plight of the balloon-makers, he came to their\r\nassistance with the offer of two condemned prisoners to be sent on the\r\nfirst aerial voyage. This offer had an unexpected effect. The pride of\r\na certain high-minded aeronaut named Rozier, who had hitherto refused\r\nto risk his life, was touched at the thought of criminals performing an\r\nact that all honest men refused. \"What! are vile criminals to have the\r\nglory of being the first to ascend into the air?\" he exclaimed. \"No,\r\nno, that must not be.\" And forthwith he offered his own services for\r\nthe hazardous undertaking.\r\n\r\nThe royal decree was accordingly repealed, to the chagrin of the\r\ncriminals, no doubt, and preparations made for the momentous attempt.\r\nMontgolfier was engaged to construct a large balloon, and on the 15th\r\nof October, 1783, the trial was made in a garden in the Faubourg St.\r\nAntoine. Let no one suppose, however, that this first man-carrying\r\nballoon was cut loose from the earth and sent skyward to shift for\r\nitself, as might be gathered from the reluctance of persons to make the\r\nascent. On the contrary, the balloon was held by strong cables, and\r\nallowed to rise only to a height of eighty feet--to the level of some\r\nof the lower windows of a modern sky-scraper--the aeronaut keeping it\r\nafloat for about five minutes by burning wool and straw in a grate made\r\nfor the purpose.\r\n\r\nThose who have witnessed the reckless manner in which the modern\r\nballoonist mounts thousands of feet into the air, seated on a trapeze\r\nor clinging to flying rings attached to an old balloon, patched and\r\nfrequently rotten, may be inclined to sneer at the brave Rozier.\r\nBut it should be remembered that in 1783 people had not learned\r\nnineteenth-century contempt for altitude. Furthermore, no one could\r\ntell what might be the effect upon the human system of ascending to a\r\ngreat height when away from a building or other terrestrial object.\r\nFainting, hemorrhages, heart-failure, and death had been predicted,\r\nand could not be practically refuted. In short, it was an absolutely\r\nnew and untried field; and it required far greater courage on the\r\npart of Rozier to mount eighty feet in a captive balloon than for a\r\nmodern aeronaut to sail thousands of feet skyward. In proof of this is\r\nRozier's subsequent record of ascents in free balloons, and dangerous\r\nvoyages, in the last of which he lost his life.\r\n\r\nTo France, therefore, belongs the honor of inventing the balloon and\r\nbeing first to test it with a human passenger. On this last point,\r\nhowever, France only eclipsed America by a few days. For while the\r\ncraze for balloon-making was at its height in France during the summer\r\nof 1783, a somewhat similar craze on a small scale had started in some\r\nof the American cities. Two members of the Philosophical Academy of\r\nPhiladelphia, Rittenhouse and Hopkins, constructed a peculiar balloon\r\nhaving forty-seven small bags inflated with hydrogen attached to a car.\r\nOn November 28th, six weeks after Rozier's ascent, this balloon was\r\nsent up, with James Wilcox, a carpenter of Philadelphia, as passenger.\r\nEverything was going well with the voyager until he suddenly discovered\r\nthat the wind was wafting him toward the Schuylkill River, which so\r\nalarmed him that in attempting to descend quickly he punctured the bags\r\nso freely that he came to the ground with considerable force, escaping,\r\nhowever, with a dislocated wrist.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in Europe, a new danger to balloonists had arisen.\r\nFanaticism was rife, particularly in the vicinity of Paris, and many\r\nmembers of the cloth were tireless in denouncing this \"tampering\r\nwith God's laws by invading the inviolability of the firmament.\"\r\nFortunately, the king took a broader view, and his soldiers were\r\nsupplied freely for protecting balloonists and their property; but even\r\nwith this protection both were roughly handled at times.\r\n\r\nBy this time England had become aroused; balloon-making became popular\r\nacross the Channel, and some new records for time and distance were\r\nsoon made. One balloon sent up in London landed in Sussex, forty-eight\r\nmiles away, making the voyage in two hours and a half. A few days later\r\na small balloon sent up in Kent was blown across the Channel and landed\r\nin Flanders. But neither of these balloons carried passengers.\r\n\r\nAs yet there had been few serious attempts at constructing dirigible\r\nballoons, but now Jean-Pierre Blanchard opened a new era of experiments\r\nby combining an ordinary balloon for obtaining the lifting power\r\nwith wings and rudder. In this balloon there was also placed an\r\numbrella-shaped sail interposed horizontally between the car and the\r\nbody of the balloon, which was to act as a sort of parachute in case of\r\naccident. On the first voyage in this balloon Blanchard was to have had\r\nfor companion a Benedictine monk; but as the machine began to rise from\r\nthe ground the monk was seized with fear, turned deadly pale, crossed\r\nhimself, and seemed about to collapse. Fortunately at this moment a\r\nleak was discovered in the balloon and it was accordingly lowered for\r\nrepairs. When these were completed the aeronaut decided to dispense\r\nwith the company of the monk, who was only too willing to gratify his\r\nwish. But just as the car was again ready to start, a stripling student\r\nfrom the Military Academy forced his way through the crowd, jumped\r\ninto the car, and announced his intention of making the ascent. Being\r\nordered from the car by Blanchard, he declared that he had the king's\r\nlicense, and when asked to produce it he drew his sword, declaring that\r\nthis was the license he referred to. By this time the crowd had lost\r\npatience; some one seized the young man unceremoniously by the collar,\r\nhauled him from the car, and turned him over to the police.\r\n\r\nA few years later particular attention was called to this incident by a\r\nrumor, which finally grew into a fixed belief in France, that the young\r\nmilitary student in question was none other than the youthful Napoleon\r\nBonaparte, then a student at the Academy. Throughout the entire reign\r\nof the emperor this was the general belief, and if it was denied at all\r\nby Napoleon, the denial was not made with due emphasis. At St. Helena,\r\nhowever, the captive emperor finally stated definitely that he was not\r\nthe hero of this escapade, who is now known to have been a student by\r\nthe name of Chambon.\r\n\r\nNothing of importance came of Blanchard's first attempt at guiding\r\na balloon with rudder and wings, except perhaps to emphasize the\r\nfact that wings of an oarlike type were useless for propulsion; but\r\nnevertheless Blanchard soon prepared a somewhat similar balloon in\r\nwhich he proposed to steer himself across the English Channel. Before\r\nthis time, as will be remembered, several balloons had crossed the\r\nChannel, but none of them had carried passengers. On this voyage\r\nBlanchard proposed to make the attempt, taking with him as companion\r\nan American physician named Jeffries. On January 7, 1785, these two\r\nembarked from the cliffs of Dover, a strong wind at the time setting\r\ntoward the French coast. Before their journey was half completed they\r\ndiscovered that an insufficient amount of ballast had been shipped,\r\nand that the balloon was gradually descending at a rate which would\r\nland them in the Channel several miles from shore. To avert this\r\ncalamity they were obliged to throw out everything in the car--books,\r\nprovisions, anchors, ropes, the \"wings\" that were intended for guiding,\r\nand also most of their garments. They were, indeed, about to cut loose\r\nthe car itself, and climb into the shrouds, when suddenly the balloon,\r\ncaught by a fresh current of air, began to rise, and was wafted to a\r\nsafe landing place. This was the most daring exploit as yet performed\r\nby the aeronauts.\r\n\r\nAlthough at least fifty different persons had made more or less\r\nextended aerial voyages during the two years that had intervened since\r\nthe invention of the first balloon, no one of them had been seriously\r\ninjured. Indeed, this apparently most dangerous undertaking had been\r\nrelegated to the grade of commonplace in popular opinion, owing to\r\nthese fortunate results. But the world was soon to learn that its first\r\nestimates of the dangers of ballooning had not been exaggerated.\r\n\r\nSince the invention of the Montgolfier balloon two distinct schools\r\nof balloonists had arisen, one of which favored the hot-air, and the\r\nother the hydrogen balloon. By the advocates of the hot-air balloon it\r\nwas claimed that the relatively small expense, and the fact that the\r\nballoonist could descend at any time and renew his supply of fuel, made\r\nthis the most desirable type, at least for long-distance voyages. By\r\nthe advocates of the hydrogen balloon it was shown that the hot-air\r\nballoon must be constructed much larger to obtain the same amount of\r\nlifting power, could be maintained in the air for a comparatively short\r\ntime at most, and was in constant danger from the fire that must be\r\nkept burning in the grate. In reply to this last charge the hot-air\r\nadvocates pointed out that a tiny spark of electricity, which would not\r\naffect the hot-air balloon, might explode the hydrogen balloon, thus\r\nintroducing an element of danger quite as great as that of the fire in\r\nthe hot-air balloons.\r\n\r\nAs an outcome of these disputes, Pilatre de Rozier, the first man\r\never to make an ascent, proposed to attempt to cross the Channel in a\r\nnew-type balloon, a combination of hot-air and hydrogen machine, which\r\nwas supposed to represent the good qualities of both types. Several\r\nmonths were consumed in constructing it, and when finally completed he\r\nand a companion attempted to cross the Channel, as had been done by\r\nBlanchard and Jeffries a short time previously. All went well at first\r\nand the balloon was several miles on its journey when suddenly the\r\nwind changed, the balloon was blown back over the heads of the anxious\r\nwatchers below, and when a short distance inland, suddenly burst into\r\nflames. At first it descended with an oscillating movement, and then,\r\nfreed from the restraining silk and canvas, it shot downward, striking\r\nthe earth with terrible force, the two occupants being killed. Thus the\r\nman to make the first ascent in a balloon was also the first to lose\r\nhis life. Rozier himself seems to have expected some such ending to his\r\nvoyages, and just before making his last ascent he remarked to a friend\r\nthat, whatever the outcome, \"one had lived long enough when one had\r\nadded something to humanity.\"\r\n\r\nThe fate of Rozier and his companion being known, and the awful\r\ndangers of balloon ascensions thus forcibly brought home, there was a\r\npopular outcry against such attempts and efforts were made to pass\r\nlaws forbidding them. But no such demand or suggestion came from the\r\nballoonists themselves. They could point to the fact that, while as yet\r\nthe balloon had been of no importance commercially, it had at least\r\nbeen turned to some account in the field of science, which was simply\r\na stepping-stone to commercial advancement. It had been the means\r\nof settling forever the question of temperature and rarefaction at\r\ndifferent altitudes, besides numerous less important although no less\r\ninteresting subjects.\r\n\r\nWhile it was true that many of the experiments of the aeronauts had\r\nadded largely to human knowledge, some of them were both dangerous\r\nand foolhardy. An exhibition of this kind of folly was given by the\r\nFrenchman, Testu-Bressy, who, wishing to test his theory that large\r\nanimals would bleed from the nose at a much lower elevation than man,\r\ndespite the thicker consistency of their blood, made an ascent mounted\r\non the back of a horse. On this occasion the aeronaut did not, even\r\ntake the simple precaution of tying the horse's feet to the car; and\r\nwhat seems most remarkable, the animal made the journey without moving\r\nor showing any sign of fear.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN INTERNATIONAL BALLOON RACE.\r\n\r\nThis view was taken before the start of an international balloon race\r\nnear Berlin. The balloons are of the ordinary non-dirigible type.]\r\n\r\nThe time was at hand, however, when Montgolfier, who had always\r\nmaintained that the true usefulness of the balloon would be in warfare,\r\nwas given the opportunity of seeing his contention verified. On the\r\nbreaking out of the French Revolution, balloon corps were at once\r\npressed into the service of the army. Napoleon Bonaparte carried with\r\nhim some balloons on his Egyptian campaign, partly for the purpose\r\nof making observations, and partly to impress the Arabs with\r\nthe superiority of Christian armies. A school of aeronautics was\r\nestablished at Meudon, and some fifty young men, sworn to secrecy,\r\nassigned to it. Balloons were constructed, tested, and distributed\r\namong the different divisions of the army, and one of these was used\r\nfor reconnoitering the position of the Austrian forces just before\r\nthe battle of Fleurus. In the course of the day two ascents were made\r\nin this balloon, which was held captive by several thousand feet of\r\ncable. The second ascent drew the fire of the enemy's cannon, but the\r\nrange was too great and no harm was done. Meanwhile the French general,\r\nJourdain, was furnished most valuable information by these aerial\r\nvoyages.\r\n\r\nThe Revolutionary wars were also responsible, indirectly, for the\r\ninvention of the parachute. It will be recalled that even as early as\r\nthe fifteenth century, Leonardo da Vinci had conceived the idea of a\r\nkind of parachute; and that Blanchard had a spread-canvas arrangement\r\nto produce a similar effect attached to some of his balloons. It was\r\nnot until 1799, however, that the folding umbrella-like parachute was\r\ninvented, the inventor, Garnerin, having developed the idea in trying\r\nto devise some means of escape from the fortress of Buda, Hungary,\r\nwhere he was being kept prisoner after one of the battles in the North\r\nbetween the Revolutionary forces and the Austrians and Prussians.\r\nAlthough he did not actually effect his escape in this dramatic\r\nmanner, he finally proved that he had not dreamed in vain during his\r\nimprisonment by demonstrating the entire practicality of the parachute.\r\n\r\nGarnerin's first practical test of his invention was made in October,\r\n1797, when he ascended to the height of six thousand feet in a balloon\r\nto which was attached a parachute of the ordinary umbrella type still\r\nused. At that altitude he cut loose the balloon which rushed upward\r\nuntil it exploded, while the parachute, dropping rapidly at first,\r\nfinally settled slowly and gently to the earth, without injury to the\r\ninventor.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROGRESS IN MECHANICAL FLIGHT\r\n\r\nThe attempts at navigating a balloon having proved thus far so\r\nunsuccessful, many inventors now returned to the idea of producing a\r\nflying-machine which was independent of the inflated balloon. It was\r\nevident that the resistance presented by the great surface necessary\r\nin a balloon of sufficient size to have the required lifting power was\r\nsuch that no known efforts of propulsion could overcome this resistance\r\neven in the face of a slight breeze, to say nothing of a strong wind.\r\nThe balloon was by no means abandoned, however, and two definite\r\nschools of aeronauts gradually came into existence, each having ardent\r\nadvocates.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1784, the aeronaut Gérard had proposed a flying-machine\r\nwhich was to be made with body, wings, and steering apparatus, in\r\nwhich propulsion was to be accomplished by the use of escaping gas and\r\ngun-cotton. The inventor himself was so sanguine of the results, and so\r\nmany contemporary inventors were of the same opinion, that when this\r\nmachine proved to be an utter failure, the blow to the advocates of\r\nthe flying-machine was so great that they did not rally from it for\r\nsomething like a quarter of a century. In 1809, however, a Viennese\r\nwatchmaker named Degen revived interest in attempts at mechanical\r\nflight by inventing a flying-machine which consisted essentially of two\r\nparachutes. These were worked by hand, and the inventor was said to\r\nhave been able to rise to a height of over fifty feet from the ground\r\n\"moving in any desired direction.\"\r\n\r\nThese claims were not borne out in fact, but they stimulated an\r\ninterest in the possibilities of mechanical flight, and in the\r\nparachute, which had never come into popular favor despite its\r\nsuccessful use by the inventor, Garnerin. Hopes were again entertained\r\nthat a modification of this device might be utilized in solving the\r\nproblem of aerial flight, and in 1837 an aeronaut, Henry Cocking,\r\ninvented a new type in which he proposed to descend from a balloon.\r\nThe parachute of Garnerin, as we know, had been constructed like a\r\nhuge umbrella, whereas Cocking's parachute had the general appearance\r\nof an umbrella held upside down. An unusual interest was aroused in\r\nthe prospective experiment from the fact that a great majority of\r\nscientists did not consider that this parachute was constructed on\r\ncorrect scientific principles, and predicted that the aeronaut would\r\nbe killed when he attempted to use it. Before the day of the trial\r\narrived numerous articles had been published, presenting arguments\r\nfor and against Cocking's device, and on the very day itself one of\r\nthe newspapers contained a long article by a leading authority on\r\naerostatics, reviewing the numerous reasons why the attempt would\r\nsurely prove a failure.\r\n\r\nDespite the protests of the majority of interested persons, however,\r\nCocking and a companion named Green made the ascent at the appointed\r\ntime. After rising to a certain height the parachute was cast off,\r\nthe parachute's car containing the inventor, while Green remained in\r\nthe balloon. Instead of sailing slowly toward the earth, however, the\r\nparachute fell rapidly, with an oscillating movement, gaining speed and\r\njerking violently as it descended, until finally when several hundred\r\nfeet in the air, Cocking was thrown from the car and dashed to pieces,\r\nwhile the wreck of the parachute landed a few yards away. Thus the\r\npredictions of the majority came true, although as we know now, the\r\ncause of the tragedy was due to faulty material rather than the design\r\nof the machine. For the American aeronaut, Wise, demonstrated a little\r\nlater that parachutes built on the same principle as that of Cocking\r\ncould be used successfully.\r\n\r\nAs we have seen, most of the flying-machines attempted heretofore\r\ntook for their model the bird with flapping wings. There were certain\r\npersons, however, who had observed that this flapping movement was not\r\nessential to flight--that certain large-winged birds, such as buzzards\r\nand hawks, were able to soar in any direction at will, holding their\r\nwings rigidly. It was evident, therefore, that shape, position, and\r\nconstruction of the bird's wing played quite as important a part as the\r\nflapping movement. The lifting power of plane surfaces, or aeroplanes,\r\nwas also carefully studied in this connection and in 1842 the inventor,\r\nHenson, constructed a flying-machine utilizing this aeroplane\r\nprinciple, his machine having thin, fixed surfaces, slightly inclined\r\nto the line of motion, and supported by the upward pressure of the air\r\ndue to the forward movement.\r\n\r\nEveryone will remember the distance to which a skilful juggler can\r\nproject an ordinary playing-card by giving it a certain inclination\r\nin throwing. It will travel upward or on a level, and continue this\r\ndirection until the force of the movement of throwing is exhausted.\r\nObviously, if this force were self-contained in the card--if it could\r\ncontinue rotating and moving forward--it could fly indefinitely. Henson\r\nhad studied and experimented with these miniature aeroplanes, and was\r\nconvinced that if the same principle that governed their flight were to\r\nbe applied to larger machines, practical flying-machines could be made.\r\n\r\n\"If any light and flat, or nearly flat, article,\" he wrote, \"be\r\nprojected edgeways in a slightly inclined position, the same will rise\r\non the air till the force exerted is expended, when the article so\r\nthrown or projected will descend; and it will readily be conceived that\r\nif the article possessed in itself a continuous power or force equal to\r\nthat used in throwing or projecting it, the article would continue to\r\nascend so long as the forward part of the surface was upward in respect\r\nto its hinder part, and that such article, when the power was stopped,\r\nor when the inclination was recovered, would descend by gravity only if\r\nthe power was stopped, or by gravity, aided by the force of the power\r\ncontained in the article, if the power be contained, thus imitating the\r\nflight of a bird.\"\r\n\r\nBut when Henson attempted to fly in his elaborately planned and\r\nconstructed flying-machine, it proved a complete failure. It showed\r\na tendency to rise, but its lifting power was insufficient for the\r\nweight of the engine driving the propellers. It was evident, however,\r\nthat if the power of the engine could be sufficiently increased, or,\r\nwhat amounts to the same thing, its weight sufficiently lightened, a\r\nmachine built on the aeroplane principle could be made to fly. But at\r\nthat time the lightest type of engine was a crude, heavy machine, and\r\nfor the moment nothing more was attempted in producing a mechanical\r\nflying-machine propelled by steam.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the possibility of producing a dirigible balloon was again\r\nbrought into prominence by the suggestion of two aeronauts, Scott and\r\nMartainville, to change the shape of the envelope of the balloon.\r\nHitherto, all balloons had been made globular or pear-shaped--shapes\r\nthat offered great resisting surfaces to the atmosphere. Now it was\r\nproposed to make them in the form of long, horizontal cylinders, with\r\npointed ends, these cigar-shaped, or boat-shaped balloons offering\r\nmuch less resistance. But here, as in the case of the flying-machine,\r\nengines that were sufficiently strong to work the propellers were found\r\nto be too heavy for the balloon to lift. Meanwhile the aeroplane idea\r\nwas brought into prominence from an unexpected quarter.\r\n\r\nAmong the numerous observers in the middle of the century who had noted\r\nthe soaring power of birds, was a French sea-captain named Le Bris. On\r\nhis long voyages he had studied the movements of the great albatross,\r\nwhich, with wings rigidly distended, outsailed the swiftest ship\r\nwithout any apparent exertion. Anxious to study the wing-mechanism of\r\nthis bird, the captain, overcoming the scruples of the mariner against\r\nkilling the sacred sea-rover, shot one of the birds. On removing a wing\r\nand spreading it in the wind he thought that it had a very appreciable\r\ntendency to pull forward into the breeze, and tended to rise when the\r\nwind was strong. Convinced that by duplicating the shape of the bird he\r\ncould construct a successful flying-machine, Le Bris set to work and\r\nsucceeded in producing a most remarkable \"air-ship.\"\r\n\r\nThe body of this machine, which was supposed to correspond to the body\r\nof the bird, was made boat-shaped, and was about thirteen feet long and\r\nfour feet wide, being broadest at its prow, in imitation of the breast\r\nof the bird. The front part was decked over, something like the bow of\r\nthe modern torpedo-boat, and through this deck protruded a small mast\r\nwhich was used for supporting the pulleys and cords used in working\r\nthe machinery of the wings. Each wing was about twenty-five feet long,\r\nso that the entire spread of the machine was fifty feet. There was\r\na tail-like structure so hinged that it could be used for steering\r\nup, down, and sidewise, the total area of surface presented to the\r\natmosphere being something over two hundred square feet, although the\r\nentire \"albatross\" weighed something less than a hundred pounds.\r\n\r\nThe front edges of the wings were made of pieces of wood fashioned\r\nlike the wings of the albatross, and feathers were imitated by a frame\r\nstructure covered with canton flannel. The front edges of the wings\r\ncould be given a rotary motion to fix them at any desired angle by an\r\ningenious device worked by two levers. In operating this artificial\r\nbird the captain proposed to stand in the boat and control its flight\r\nby these sets of levers and by balancing his body.\r\n\r\nHaving full confidence in the ability of his invention to soar once\r\nit had been given an initial velocity, the captain selected a morning\r\nwhen a good breeze was blowing and hired a cart-driver to carry him\r\nout into the neighboring fields. The machine was placed horizontally\r\nupon the cart and fastened to it with a rope which could be loosened\r\nby the pulling of a slip-knot held by the captain, who took his\r\nposition in the boat. On reaching the open country the driver put his\r\nhorse into a brisk trot when, the levers controlling the wings being\r\nset, the machine rose gracefully into the air and travelled forward a\r\ndistance of perhaps a hundred yards. At this moment the running-rope in\r\nsome unaccountable manner became wound about the body of the driver,\r\nhauling him unceremoniously from his seat, and dangling him writhing\r\nand shrieking at the end of the rope, several feet above the ground.\r\nAs it happened, his weight was just sufficient to counterbalance the\r\nwind, so that acting in the capacity of the tail of a kite, he assisted\r\nmaterially, if involuntarily, in keeping the artificial bird in flight.\r\n\r\nWhen the captain became aware of what was going on below, he altered\r\nthe angle of the wings and came slowly to the earth, descending without\r\naccident either to himself or to his machine. All things considered,\r\nthis was a remarkable performance, and it was so considered by people\r\nin the neighborhood, who made a hero of the gallant mariner. His next\r\nattempt, however, was less successful. Something went wrong with the\r\nmachine shortly after starting, landing the inventor in a stone-quarry\r\nwith a broken leg and a shattered machine. This accident also shook the\r\ncourage of the captain, and for several years he made no more attempts\r\nat flight, confining his attention to sailing a coasting-vessel. But\r\nhis faith in his \"albatross\" never wavered, even if his courage did for\r\na time, and in 1867 he began building a more elaborate machine, aided\r\nby public subscriptions. The outlook for this new device seemed very\r\npromising, several fairly successful flights of perhaps two hundred\r\nyards having been made, when a sudden gust of wind catching up the\r\nmachine one day during the momentary absence of the inventor, dashed\r\nit to pieces upon the ground. This was the final blow to the hopes\r\nof Captain Le Bris, who made no further attempts, his means and his\r\nenergies being entirely exhausted.\r\n\r\n\r\nGIFFARD, \"THE FULTON OF AERIAL NAVIGATION\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the advocates of the dirigible balloon had not remained idle,\r\nmany of them attempting to utilize the principle of the aeroplane\r\nin connection with a balloon. Some of these machines were of most\r\nfantastic design, but one in particular, that of Mr. Henri Giffard,\r\nsucceeded so well, and proved to be dirigible to such an extent, that\r\nGiffard is sometimes referred to by enthusiastic admirers as \"the\r\nFulton of aerial navigation.\" In principle, and indeed in general\r\nappearance, this balloon was not unlike some of the balloons built by\r\nSantos-Dumont fifty years later. It had the now-familiar cigar shape,\r\ncommon to most modern dirigible balloons; and beneath was suspended a\r\ncar carrying a steam-engine that worked a screw propeller. The rudder,\r\nplaced at the stern just below the balloon in a position corresponding\r\nto the rudder of a ship, was a large canvas sail set in a frame.\r\nThe envelope of the balloon was one hundred and fifty feet long and\r\nforty feet in diameter and contained about ninety thousand cubic feet\r\nof coal-gas. To lessen the danger of igniting this from the engine,\r\nGiffard arranged the chimney so that it pointed downward, and suspended\r\nit some forty feet below the envelope.\r\n\r\nOn September 24, 1852, he rose from the Paris Hippodrome, and succeeded\r\nin making a headway of from five to seven miles an hour in the face\r\nof a strong wind. In response to the rudder his balloon performed\r\nsome difficult evolutions, turning right or left at the will of\r\nthe operator. He continued his maneuvers for some time, and then\r\nextinguishing his fire, opened the valve and returned safely to the\r\nground. This was a great victory for the advocates of the dirigible\r\nballoon, and was indeed a performance that has not until recently been\r\nsurpassed in the fifty years that have intervened since that time.\r\nBut despite this initial success, Giffard soon renounced the field of\r\naeronautics, and no worthy successor appeared to take his place for\r\nmore than a quarter of a century.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VOYAGES OF THE _GIANT_\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable balloons ever constructed, and one of the\r\nmost remarkable voyages ever made in any balloon, was that of the\r\nmammoth aerostat constructed by the noted Parisian photographer,\r\nNadar, in 1863. Nadar belonged to the school of aviators who opposed\r\nthe principle of the balloon as against that of the aeroplane, and his\r\nidea in constructing this leviathan balloon was simply for the purpose\r\nof raising money so that he might build a practical flying-machine,\r\nconstructed on the aeroplane principle, and which, he declared,\r\nwould revolutionize air navigation. The _Giant_, he said, would be\r\nthe last balloon ever constructed, as thereafter air-ships, made on\r\nthe principle of the one he was about to construct, would supplant\r\nballoons entirely. His plan was to make the ascent in the _Giant_ from\r\nsome large enclosed field near Paris, and the admission price of one\r\nfranc to be charged for entering the field was to supply funds for\r\ndefraying the expense of building the _Giant_, the surplus to be used\r\nin constructing his flying-machine.\r\n\r\nIn making the _Giant_ twenty-one thousand yards of silk were used,\r\nthe balloon being over two hundred feet in height, with a lifting\r\ncapacity of nine thousand pounds. It was built as a double balloon,\r\none within the other, this being the idea of the aeronaut, Louis\r\nGodard, as a means of preserving the excess of gas produced by dilation\r\nat different altitudes, instead of losing this excess as was usual\r\nwith balloons constructed in the ordinary manner. But perhaps the\r\nmost interesting thing about this balloon was the structure of the\r\ncar and its contents. Like the ordinary car it was constructed of\r\nwicker work, but was of the proportions of a small house, being built\r\ntwo stories high, with an upper platform like the deck of a ship,\r\non which the passengers could stand. In the two floors below were a\r\nsaloon, compartments for scientific instruments, sleeping-cabins, and\r\npractically all the conveniences of a small, modern house. In the car\r\nand suspended about it were wheels, guns, a printing-press, cameras,\r\ncages of carrier-pigeons, baskets of wine and provisions, games, and an\r\n\"abundant supply of confectionery.\"\r\n\r\nThe first ascent was made from the Champs de Mars, and twenty-five\r\nthousand persons paid the admission fee to witness it. This did not by\r\nany means represent the number of persons on the field, as the barriers\r\nwere broken down in many places early in the day, and a majority of\r\nthe spectators thus gained free admission. Fifteen persons made the\r\nascent upon this occasion, but instead of making a protracted voyage as\r\nintended at first, the balloon was brought to the earth at nine o'clock\r\nin the evening only a few leagues from Paris. It is said that this\r\nlanding was made contrary to the wishes of Nadar, but in deference to\r\nthe opinion of the Godard brothers, who believed that the balloon was\r\nbeing carried out to sea, whereas, in point of fact it was travelling\r\ndue east, directly away from the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nThree weeks later the second ascent was made, on this occasion eight\r\ninstead of fifteen persons starting on the voyage. These were under\r\nthe immediate command of Nadar, whose position was that of the captain\r\nof a ship on the high seas, and whose authority none might presume to\r\nquestion. A set of rules governing the conduct of those on board and\r\nsetting forth explicitly the authority of the captain was posted in\r\nthe cabin, the nature of some of these giving a cue to the peculiar\r\nattitude of mind of the originator of the scheme. For example, it was\r\nordered that \"Silence must be absolutely observed when ordered by\r\nthe captain.\" \"All gambling is expressly prohibited.\" \"On landing no\r\npassenger must quit the balloon without permission duly acquired from\r\nthe captain.\"\r\n\r\nThe ascent was again successful, the balloon travelling in a\r\nnortheasterly direction during the night, all the passengers remaining\r\nawake and alert, having constantly in mind the danger of falling into\r\nthe sea. The following morning on descending to a lower altitude\r\nthrough the clouds, the voyagers found that they were passing the\r\nborder of Holland, near the sea. At this point an attempt was made to\r\nland, but a violent gale having arisen, the anchor cables were broken,\r\nand the car was dragged along the surface of the ground at terrific\r\nspeed, striking and rebounding into the air, dragging through marshes\r\nand rivers, bruising and battering the occupants who were unable either\r\nto leave the balloon or to check its flight. As they were whirling\r\nacross the country in this manner an immense forest came into view\r\ndirectly in their path, and believing that when this was reached every\r\noccupant of the car would be dashed to pieces against the trees, they\r\ndecided to take their chances by leaping. One after another they\r\njumped, striking the earth and turning over and over, breaking bones,\r\nand mangling faces and bodies. The only female occupant of the car,\r\nMrs. Nadar, was fortunate in alighting in a river without serious\r\ninjury. Others received only slight bruises or a severe jolting while\r\nthe most unfortunate, M. St. Felix, had a broken arm, a dislocated\r\nankle, and numerous cuts and bruises.\r\n\r\nLater the _Giant_ was captured many miles farther on and returned to\r\nits owners in Paris. Subsequently it made numerous voyages, none of\r\nwhich was particularly profitable, however, so that the purpose for\r\nwhich it was designed was not fulfilled, and Nadar's proposed air-ship\r\nwas never constructed.\r\n\r\nWhile the _Giant_ was the largest balloon hitherto constructed, it\r\nbroke no records either for speed attained or distance travelled, and\r\nmuch more notable performances in this respect had been made before its\r\ntime and have been made since. Thus, one of Coxwell's balloons traveled\r\nfrom Berlin in the direction of Dantzig, covering the distance of one\r\nhundred and seventy miles in three hours. This was in 1849; and in the\r\nsame year M. Arban crossed the Alps from Marseilles to Turin, covering\r\nthe distance of four hundred miles in eight hours. In July, 1859,\r\nthe American aeronaut, John Wise, sailed from St. Louis, Missouri,\r\nto Henderson, in New York State, in nineteen hours, travelling eight\r\nhundred and fifty miles at the rate of forty-six miles an hour. This\r\nwas the longest voyage ever made until the time of the balloon-races\r\nstarted from the Paris Exposition, in 1900. On this occasion Conte de\r\nla Vaux, starting from Paris, remained in the air thirty-five hours and\r\nforty-five minutes, landing at Korosticheff, in Russia, 1193 miles from\r\nthe starting-point, thus breaking all previous records.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY WAR-BALLOONS AND DIRIGIBLE BALLOONS\r\n\r\nDespite the fact that the \"aviators\"--the aeronauts whose efforts\r\nwere directed to flight by mechanical means in imitation of birds,\r\nor by the use of what are now called aeroplanes--were in the field\r\ncenturies before the balloon was invented, from the time of the first\r\nMontgolfier balloon until very recently, the balloonists had shown\r\ntheir rivals a clean pair of heels in practical results. A dirigible,\r\nman-carrying balloon that can be guided under favorable conditions, and\r\ncan maintain itself in the air for any considerable length of time, was\r\nan accomplished fact at least five years before the practical aeroplane\r\nflying-machine. Yet the majority of scientists had become convinced\r\nseveral years before their convictions were verified by actual\r\ndemonstration, that some type of mechanical flying-machine--a machine\r\nthat is heavier than the atmosphere and that maintains itself by some\r\nmechanical means--was the only one likely to solve the question of\r\naerial flight. Yet thus far balloons have rendered more actual service\r\nto man than flying-machines.\r\n\r\nIt will be recalled that balloons were used for making military\r\nobservations during the French Revolution; and they were used for\r\nsimilar purposes in several of the Continental wars during the first\r\nhalf of the nineteenth century. After that time, however, interest\r\nin their use for this purpose flagged somewhat until the time of the\r\nCrimean War, when their usefulness was again demonstrated, as it was in\r\nthe American Civil War which followed shortly after.\r\n\r\nBut it was not until the Franco-Prussian War that the one thing for\r\nwhich the Montgolfiers had predicted their usefulness in warfare--that\r\nof sending messages out from a closely besieged city--was put to\r\npractical test. During the siege of Paris by the Germans in 1870-71,\r\nwhen every other possible means of communication had been cut off, the\r\nParisians still kept in communication with the outside world by means\r\nof balloons and carrier-pigeons. On September 23rd, the first ascent\r\nof the siege was made by the aeronaut Durouf, who carried a large\r\nnumber of despatches from the city, landing near Evreux, after being\r\nin the air about three hours. The success of this journey and several\r\nothers that quickly followed led the French Government to establish\r\na regular balloon-post, and to undertake the manufacture of balloons\r\nfor this purpose. The mere matter of balloon construction offered no\r\ndifficulty but a more serious one was met in the lack of experienced\r\naeronauts. In this emergency, however, it occurred to the authorities\r\nthat sailors, accustomed to climbing about at dizzy heights, might be\r\ntaught to take the place of trained aeronauts. This experiment proved\r\nmost successful, and in subsequent voyages these mariners maintained\r\ntheir reputation for daring undertakings. Between September and January\r\nsixty-four balloons were sent up, all but seven of which fulfilled\r\ntheir mission and delivered their despatches; and the total number of\r\npersons leaving Paris in balloons during the siege was one hundred and\r\nfifty-five. These carried with them a total of nine tons of despatches\r\nand something like three million letters, the speed with which these\r\njourneys were made ranging from a minimum of twenty miles an hour to a\r\nmaximum velocity, in one instance, of eighty miles.\r\n\r\nShortly after this balloon-post was established, the Germans came into\r\npossession of the new Krupp long-range rifle, with which they succeeded\r\nin bringing down several of the balloons. Companies of Uhlans, the\r\nswiftest cavalry of Germany, scoured the country constantly, and kept\r\nsuch a sharp lookout that, as the German lines were extended, it became\r\ndifficult for the balloons to make their way over them in daylight.\r\nNight voyages, therefore, became necessary; but naturally these\r\nwere extremely dangerous, and many of them had dramatic and tragic\r\nterminations. One of the longest and most famous of these voyages was\r\nthat of the balloon named the _Ville d'Orléans_, which left Paris\r\nabout midnight of November 24th. As a strong wind was blowing from\r\nthe north at the time, it was hoped that the balloon would descend\r\nin the vicinity of Tours. The first intimation that the voyagers had\r\nthat there was a deviation from this course was the sound of the\r\nwaves breaking against the shore beneath them. At this time they were\r\nin a thick mist, and it was not until some time after daybreak that\r\nthis mist cleared away sufficiently for them to get an idea of their\r\nsurroundings. Then they found, to their horror, that they were over a\r\nlarge body of water, out of sight of land, in what part of the world\r\nthey had not the slightest idea. The balloon appeared to be drifting\r\nrapidly, and from time to time they passed over vessels, which were\r\nfrantically signaled by the voyagers. No notice was taken of these\r\nsignals except by one vessel, which responded by firing several shots\r\nwhich went wide of the mark. The balloon continued on its course\r\nnorthward until late in the day when land was sighted lying to the\r\nnortheast. By this time the ballast in the car had been entirely\r\nexpended, and the balloon, which had been sinking gradually for several\r\nhours, seemed about to plunge into the ocean. In this extremity a heavy\r\nbag of despatches was thrown out, and the balloon thus lightened again\r\nrose to a considerable height, where another current of air carried it\r\nover the land.\r\n\r\nA successful landing was made in Norway, in a desolate but friendly\r\nregion, where the balloonists were treated with the greatest kindness.\r\nThe balloon and its contents were subsequently secured, and all the\r\ndespatches delivered to their proper destinations, except, of course,\r\nthe one package that had been thrown out as ballast.\r\n\r\nA week after the eventful voyage of the _Ville d'Orléans_ a still\r\nmore unfortunate ascent was made by a sailor named Prince, in the\r\nballoon called the _Jacquard_. As the ropes releasing this balloon\r\nwere cut, the enthusiastic mariner, standing in his car and extending\r\nhis hand toward the crowd, shouted dramatically, \"I go upon a great\r\nvoyage!\" He did--and on one much greater than he anticipated--for the\r\nballoon was blown out to sea and lost. As he was passing over England\r\nafter successfully crossing the Channel, he threw out his package of\r\ndespatches, but this so lightened his balloon that it mounted quickly\r\nand was soon far out over the Atlantic. It was never heard of again.\r\nBut the life of the enthusiastic voyager was not given in vain, for\r\nmost of the despatches eventually reached their destination.\r\n\r\nAlthough, as has been seen, the balloons sent out of Paris were not of\r\nthe dirigible kind, and were entirely dependent upon the caprice of the\r\nwinds, they fulfilled their missions quite as well as could be expected\r\nunder the circumstances. In fact, there was small chance of failure,\r\nstarting as they did from a central point, and being almost certain of\r\nsuccess no matter what direction was taken, except, indeed, the one\r\nthat would blow them over the German frontier. But the other part of\r\nthe problem--the sending of balloons from the outside into Paris--was\r\nan entirely different proposition. So different, and so difficult, in\r\nfact, that it was never accomplished, although attempted several times.\r\n\r\nBut the millions of people in Paris, shut off completely from the\r\noutside world, were just as anxious to receive news as to send it. In\r\nattempting to establish communication from without, therefore, one\r\nballoon leaving the city in the early days of the siege, carried with\r\nit some trained dogs in the hope that they would make their way back to\r\nthe city through the German lines. But either they lost their way, or\r\nwere captured by the enemy, for nothing was ever heard of them after\r\nstarting on the return trip. In this extremity the members of the\r\n\"Société Colombophile\" came forward with the offer of the use of their\r\nhoming-pigeons. The society had a large number of these birds, trained\r\nto return to their cotes from long distances, and the experiment of\r\nsending return despatches with them was tried at once. Three birds\r\nwere first sent out in one of the despatch-balloons, and within\r\nsixteen hours after starting these had all returned to the capital,\r\nbearing despatches. During the next few days a score more pigeons were\r\nsent out, eighteen of which returned safely with their messages; and\r\nthereafter a regular pigeon-post was organized.\r\n\r\nAs the weight that a pigeon is able to carry in its flight is extremely\r\nsmall, microscopic photography was resorted to, so that, although each\r\nbird carried only a single quill in which were rolled thin collodion\r\nleaves, the whole weighing only fifteen grains, the amount of printed\r\nmatter thus carried was sometimes more than is contained in an ordinary\r\nvolume.\r\n\r\nBy photographic methods, thirty-two thousand words, or about half an\r\nordinary volume, were crowded upon a pellicule two inches long by one\r\nand one-quarter inches wide, and weighing about three-quarters of a\r\ngrain! Twenty of these, representing six thousand words, or twice the\r\namount of printed matter contained in such a book as Scott's _Ivanhoe_,\r\nor Prescott's _Conquest of Mexico_, were carried by each pigeon. One\r\nbird carried forty thousand complete messages on a single trip.\r\n\r\nWhen the bird arrived at its cote, the quill was secured and taken\r\nto the government office, where the little leaflets were carefully\r\nremoved, placed in an enlarging optical apparatus, thrown upon a screen\r\nwith a magic lantern, and copied. The messages were then distributed to\r\ntheir destination about the city.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DIRIGIBLE BALLOON ACHIEVED\r\n\r\nBy this war, France, the home of the balloon, was brought keenly to\r\nrealize the advantages and the limitations of such flying-machines;\r\nand it was but natural, under the circumstances, that as soon as peace\r\nwas restored, efforts should be made there to produce a dirigible\r\nballoon, or some other form of dirigible flying-machine. Giffard, as\r\nwe have seen, had been fairly successful; and now M. Dupuy de Lome,\r\nchief naval constructor of France, took up the problem. He constructed\r\na balloon with a cigar-shaped envelope one hundred and twenty feet\r\nlong and fifty feet in diameter. Beneath this was a rudder placed in\r\nthe same position as that of a ship; and suspended still further below\r\nwas a large car fitted with a two-bladed screw-propeller, thirty feet\r\nin diameter. Manual labor was to be used for turning this screw, two\r\nrelays of four men each relieving each other at the work. An ascent\r\nwas made in February, 1872, with fourteen persons in the car, who,\r\nby working in relays, demonstrated that a speed of about seven miles\r\nan hour could be maintained in any direction in still air. As the\r\nwind was blowing about thirty miles an hour at the time, however, the\r\ncourse of the balloon could only be deflected, and the main object of\r\nthe ascent--the return to Paris--could not be accomplished. In short,\r\nDe Lome's balloon demonstrated little more than had been accomplished\r\nby Giffard with his steam-driven balloon. Both had shown that with\r\nsufficient power the balloon could be made to travel in any direction\r\nin still air, but neither had been able to make headway against a\r\nstrong wind.\r\n\r\nIt was estimated at the time of Dupuy de Lome's ascent, that had a\r\nsteam-engine of a weight corresponding to that of the eight workmen\r\nbeen used, at least twice the power could have been obtained. But\r\nsteam was considered too dangerous, and some other motive power which\r\ncombined lightness with power seemed absolutely essential. The electric\r\nmotor gave promise of success in this direction, and in 1883 the two\r\nTissandier brothers in France applied such a motor to a balloon that\r\nwas able to make headway against a seven-mile breeze, but was still far\r\nfrom fulfilling the requirements of an entirely dirigible balloon. Two\r\nyears later the motor-driven balloon _La France_, of Renard and Krebs,\r\nattained a speed of fourteen miles an hour, and showed a distinct\r\nadvance over all preceding models.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile motors were being reduced in weight and increased in power,\r\nand the hearts of aviators and balloonists were cheered by the fact\r\nthat the light metal, aluminum, was steadily growing cheaper. Visions\r\nof an all-aluminum balloon were constantly before the minds of the\r\ninventors, and in 1894 such dreams took practical form in a balloon\r\nwhose construction was begun by Herr Schwartz, under the auspices\r\nof the German Government. This balloon was of most complicated\r\nconstruction, depending for its lifting power upon the gas-filled\r\naluminum tank, but utilizing for its steering-gear many of the features\r\nof the aeroplane. It was essentially a balloon, not a flying-machine,\r\nhowever, with a ten to twelve horse-power benzine-engine actuating four\r\npropelling screws.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TWO FAMOUS FRENCH WAR BALLOONS.\r\n\r\nThe lower figure the dirigible war balloon \"La Patrie,\" which\r\nmanœuvered on the Eastern boundary of France, and which was blown\r\naway and lost taking a northwesterly direction which probably landed\r\nit ultimately in the Arctic Sea--in 1908. The upper figure represents\r\nM. Deutsch's dirigible balloon \"Ville de Paris\" which was sent to the\r\nfrontier to take the place of the lost \"Patrie.\"]\r\n\r\nBefore the balloon was completed Herr Schwartz died, but his plans were\r\nknown to his wife, and, although considerably altered, were carried to\r\ncompletion. When all was finished, Herr Jaegels, an engineer who had\r\nhad no experience as an aeronaut, volunteered to make an ascent and\r\nthis metal ship-of-promise was launched. At first it rose rapidly and\r\nappeared to be making good progress against a strong wind; but suddenly\r\nit stopped, descended rapidly, and was smashed to pieces, the aeronaut\r\nsaving himself by jumping just before it touched the ground. It\r\ndeveloped later that he had lost control of the machine, simply because\r\nthe machinery was too complicated for a single operator to handle. On\r\ndiscovering this, Herr Jaegels, confused for the moment, threw open the\r\nvalve, causing the balloon to descend too rapidly. Thus the fruit of\r\nyears of study and labor and the expenditure of fifty thousand dollars\r\nin money resulted in only about six minutes of actual flight.\r\n\r\nTo most persons this experiment of the aluminum balloon would seem to\r\nhave been a dismal failure, but it was not so regarded by the advocates\r\nof the dirigible balloon. The flight of the balloon, to be sure, was\r\nfar from a success; but this was attributed to improper management\r\nrather than to any inherent defect in the balloon itself, or in the\r\nprinciple upon which it was constructed. Instead of being discouraged,\r\ntherefore, the school of balloonists, who had lost some of their\r\nprestige of late by the performances of the flying-machines of Maxim\r\nand Langley, undertook, through their enthusiastic representative,\r\nCount Zeppelin, the construction of the largest, most expensive,\r\nand most carefully built dirigible balloon heretofore constructed.\r\nThis balloon was of proportions warranting the name of \"air-ship.\"\r\nThe great cigar-shaped body was almost four hundred feet in length,\r\nand thirty feet in diameter--the proportions of a fair-sized ocean\r\nliner--and like the hull of its ocean prototype, was divided into\r\ncompartments--seventeen in number, and gas-tight. Its frame-work was of\r\naluminum rods and wires, and the skin of the envelope was made of silk,\r\ncoated with india-rubber. It was equipped with four aluminum screws,\r\nand two aluminum cars were placed below the body at a considerable\r\ndistance apart. The motive power was supplied by benzine motors,\r\nselected because of their lightness.\r\n\r\nThe company for constructing this balloon was capitalized at about two\r\nhundred thousand dollars, the cost of the shed alone, which rested on\r\nninety-five pontoons on the surface of the lake of Constance, near the\r\ntown of Manzell, being fifty thousand dollars. July 2nd, 1910, the\r\ncount and four assistants in the cars, started on the maiden voyage.\r\nThe balloon rose and made headway at the rate of eighteen miles an\r\nhour, responding readily to the rudder, but soon broke or deranged\r\nsome of the steering-gear so that it became unmanageable and descended\r\nat Immerstaad, a little over three miles from the starting-point.\r\nConsidering the amount of thought, care, and money that had been\r\nexpended upon it, its performance could hardly be looked upon as a\r\nstartling success. By the advocates of the aeroplane principle it was\r\nconsidered an utter failure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ZEPPELIN DIRIGIBLE BALLOON.\r\n\r\nCount Zeppelin's famous balloons are of the semi-rigid type, being\r\ncased in thin loops of aluminum. The wing-like projections at the\r\nsides add greatly to the stability and dirigibility of the balloon.\r\nThe problem of housing has been met by erecting a structure over the\r\nwater. It is planned to have a balloon house that will revolve and thus\r\nfacilitate the introduction of the balloon whatever the direction of\r\nthe wind. With the above stationary house this is a difficult manœuvre\r\nif the wind chances to blow laterally.]\r\n\r\nBut while Count Zeppelin was experimenting with his ponderous leviathan\r\nair-ship, a kindred spirit, the young Brazilian, M. Santos-Dumont,\r\nwas making experiments along similar lines, but with balloons that\r\nwere mere cockle-shells as compared with the German monster. The\r\nyoung inventor had come to Paris from his home in South America\r\nbacked by an immense fortune, and by a fund of enthusiasm, courage,\r\nand determination unsurpassed by any aerial experimenter in any age.\r\nHe began at once experimenting with balloons of different shapes,\r\nwith screws and paddles, and, perhaps most important of all, with\r\nthe new, light petroleum-motors just then being introduced for use\r\non automobiles, electricity not having proved a success in aerial\r\nexperiments.\r\n\r\nHis first balloon, _No. 1_, built in 1898, was devoid of any\r\nparticularly novel features. His _No. 2_ showed some advancement,\r\nand his _No. 3_, while a decided improvement, still came far short\r\nof answering the requirements of a dirigible balloon. But the young\r\nexperimenter was learning and profiting by his failures--and,\r\nincidentally, was having hairbreadth escapes from death, meeting with\r\nmany accidents, and being severely injured on occasion.\r\n\r\nAbout this time a prize of one hundred thousand francs was offered\r\nby M. Deutsch to the aeronaut who should ascend from a specified\r\nplace in a park in Paris, make the circuit of the Eiffel Tower, and\r\nreturn to the starting-point within half an hour. With the honor of\r\ncapturing this prize as an additional incentive, Santos-Dumont began\r\nthe construction of his fourth balloon, the _Santos-Dumont No. 4_.\r\nIn this balloon everything but bare essentials was sacrificed to\r\nlightness, even the car being done away with, the aeronaut controlling\r\nthe machinery and directing the movements of the balloon from a bamboo\r\nsaddle. But an accident soon destroyed this balloon, and a fifth was\r\nhastily constructed. With this the enthusiastic aeronaut showed that\r\nhe was almost within grasping distance of the prize in a series of\r\nsensational flights between the first part of July and the first week\r\nin August. The tower was actually rounded, but on the return trip\r\nthe balloon collided with a high building in the Rue Alboni and was\r\nwrecked, the escape of the aeronaut without a scratch being little\r\nshort of miraculous.\r\n\r\nNothing daunted, the inventor began the construction of _Santos-Dumont\r\nNo. 6_ immediately, finishing it just twenty-eight days after the\r\nconstruction of _No. 5_. A peculiarity of this balloon was that it\r\nwas barely self-sustaining except when forced through the air by the\r\npropeller. The long cigar-shaped gas-bag was relatively small, and was\r\nfilled to its limit of capacity with gas, while the lifting power was\r\ncounterbalanced by the operator, car, engine, and ballast, so that the\r\nentire structure weighed practically the same as the air it displaced.\r\nAt the stern was a powerful propeller. Obviously, then, if the long\r\nspindle-shaped machine was tilted upward at the forward end, and the\r\npropeller started, it would be driven upward; while if the forward end\r\nwas lowered the propeller would drive it downward. If it was balanced\r\nso as to be perfectly horizontal, it would be forced forward in a\r\nhorizontal direction. Deflections to right and to left were obtained by\r\nthe ordinary type of vertical rudder; and thus any direction could be\r\ntaken.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN ENGLISH DIRIGIBLE BALLOON.\r\n\r\nThe photograph here reproduced gives a very vivid impression of the\r\ncumbersome nature of balloons of this modern type, and suggests the\r\ndifficulties to be met in housing them safely when not in use.]\r\n\r\nTo obtain the desired angle of inclination, Santos-Dumont made\r\nuse of a sliding weight, and with this he guided his balloon upward\r\nand downward by shifting its position. Thus, although this balloon\r\nwas a veritable balloon rather than a \"flying-machine\" proper, it\r\nreally lacked the one essential common to balloons: it would not rise\r\nuntil propelled by mechanical means. It lacked the requisite of the\r\nflying-machine, however, in that it was not \"many times heavier than\r\nthe air.\" After giving this new balloon several preliminary trials,\r\nwhich included such exciting incidents as collisions with a tree\r\nin the Bois du Boulogne, an official attempt was made on October\r\n29th, 1800. Above the heads of the gaping thousands, who, to a man,\r\nwished the daring navigator success, the balloon rounded the tower,\r\nand in twenty-nine minutes and thirty seconds from the moment of\r\nstarting--thirty seconds less than the prescribed time-limit--the trip\r\nwas successfully terminated.\r\n\r\nThis voyage must be considered as marking an epoch in aerial\r\nnavigation. The dirigible balloon was accomplished. A decided step\r\nforward in the conquest of the air had been made, although from a\r\npractical standpoint this step was confessedly a short one. For while\r\n_No. 6_ could be propelled in any direction under ordinary conditions,\r\ncarrying a single passenger, it was on the whole more of a toy\r\nship than a practical sailing-craft. Nevertheless, its performance\r\nwas a decided victory for the balloon over the flying-machine.\r\nNo flying-machine of whatever type had ever even approached the\r\nperformance of _Santos-Dumont No. 6_, which had carried a man on a\r\nvoyage in the air, traveling with the wind, against it, and with the\r\nwind on either quarter at every possible angle at various times during\r\nthe journey. And yet there were few scientists, indeed, if any, who\r\nconsidered that the problem of aerial navigation was solved; and to\r\na large number Santos-Dumont's performance seemed little more than\r\nan extension of Giffard's idea, made possible by improved machinery\r\nnot available half a century ago. To them it was the triumph of the\r\nenergy, skill, and courage of an individual, not the triumph of a\r\nprinciple--which, after all, is the absolute essential.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ENGLISH (LOWER FIGURE) AND AMERICAN DIRIGIBLE WAR\r\nBALLOONS AND A WRIGHT AEROPLANE.\r\n\r\nThe above figures are introduced on one page for the purpose of\r\ncomparison and contrast. The American balloon is the Baldwin airship.\r\nThe essential clumsiness of a lighter-than-air craft, as contrasted\r\nwith the relative gracefulness and manageableness of the aeroplane, is\r\nstrikingly suggested by this illustration.]\r\n\r\nSince the successful performance of Santos-Dumont in rounding the\r\nEiffel Tower many other dirigible balloons have been constructed,\r\nnot only in America and in Europe by various inventors, but by the\r\nBrazilian aeronaut himself. The most remarkable of these is the\r\n_Zeppelin II_, the fifth creation of the indomitable Count Zeppelin.\r\nIn principle and general lines of construction this balloon closely\r\nresembles the one described a few pages back. Its best performance,\r\nhowever, is more remarkable. Starting from Lake Constance on the night\r\nof May 29th, 1909, and sailing almost directly northward regardless\r\nof air currents, the balloon reached Bitterfield, a few miles beyond\r\nLeipzig, four hundred and sixty-five miles from the starting-point,\r\nthe following evening. Turning back at this point, without alighting,\r\nit had almost completed its return trip, when on coming to the ground\r\nfor a supply of fuel it was injured by collision with the branches of a\r\ntree. The injury sustained, while delaying and marring the voyage, did\r\nnot prevent the balloon from completing its eight-hundred-and-fifty\r\nmile voyage, and establishing a new record for dirigibles.\r\n\r\nThis and sundry other flights amply demonstrated the dirigibility and\r\nrelative safety of the balloon under varying atmospheric conditions.\r\nBut the difficulties that attend the management of such a craft when\r\nnot high in air were again vividly illustrated when, in April, 1910,\r\nthe Zeppelin II., was totally wrecked while at anchor by the force of a\r\ngale which it might easily have outridden had it been beyond the reach\r\nof terrestrial obstacles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nTHE TRIUMPH OF THE AEROPLANE\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the dirigible balloon in the hands of Santos-Dumont gained\r\na decisive victory over all mechanical methods of flight theretofore\r\ndiscovered, even the inventor himself considered it rather as a means\r\nto an end, than the end itself. That end, it would seem, must be a\r\nflying-machine, many times heavier than the atmosphere, but able by\r\nmechanical means to lift and propel itself through the air. The natural\r\nrepresentative of this kind of flying-machine, the bird, is something\r\nlike a thousand times as heavy as the air which its bulk displaces.\r\nThe balloon, on the other hand, with its equipments and occupants,\r\nmust necessarily be lighter than air; and as the ordinary gas used for\r\ninflating is only about seven times lighter than the atmosphere, it can\r\nbe readily understood that for a balloon to acquire any great amount\r\nof lifting power it must be of enormous proportions. To attempt to\r\nforce this great, fragile bulk of light material through the atmosphere\r\nat any great rate of speed is obviously impossible on account of\r\nthe resistance offered by its surfaces. On the other hand, any such\r\nstructure strong enough to resist the enormous pressure at high speed\r\nwould be too heavy to float.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE AEROPLANE OF M. SANTOS DUMONT.\r\n\r\nM. Santos Dumont's chief fame as an aviator is based on his flights\r\nwith a dirigible balloon. He has experimented extensively, however,\r\nwith the heavier-than-air type of machine, though none of his flights\r\nwith this apparatus has been record-breaking.]\r\n\r\nThese facts are so patent that it is but natural to inquire how\r\nthe balloonists could ever have expected to accomplish flight at\r\nmore than a nominal rate of speed; and, on the other hand, it might\r\nbe asked, naturally enough, how the aviators expected to fly with\r\naeroplane machines at least a thousand times heavier than the air.\r\nIn reply, the aviators could point to birds and bats as examples of\r\nhow the apparently impossible is easily accomplished in nature; while\r\nthe balloonists could simply point to their accomplished flights as\r\npractical demonstrations. The aviators could point to no past records\r\nof accomplishments, but nevertheless they had good ground for the faith\r\nthat was in them, and as we shall see were later to justify their\r\ntheories by practical demonstrations.\r\n\r\nEverybody is aware that there is an enormous difference in the\r\nlifting power of still air and air in motion, and that this power is\r\ndependent upon velocity. The difference between the puff of wind that\r\nbarely lifts a thin sheet of paper from the table, and the tornado\r\nthat uproots trees and wrecks stone buildings, is one of velocity.\r\nObviously, then, moving air is quite a different substance from still\r\nair when it comes to dealing with aeronautics.\r\n\r\nOne of the most familiar examples of the lifting power of moving air\r\nis that of the kite. An ordinary kite is many times heavier than the\r\nair and has no more tendency to rise in the air than a corresponding\r\nweight of lead under ordinary conditions. Yet this same kite, if held\r\nby a string with its surfaces inclined to the wind at a certain angle,\r\nwill be lifted with a force proportionate to the velocity of the wind\r\nand the size of the surfaces. On a windy day the kite-flyer holding\r\nthe string and standing still will have his kite pushed upward into\r\nthe air by the current rushing beneath its surface. On a still day he\r\nmay accomplish the same thing by running forward with the kite-string,\r\nthus causing the surface of the kite to \"slide over\" the opposing\r\natmosphere. In short, it makes no difference whether the air or kite is\r\nmoving, so long as the effect of the current rushing against the lower\r\nsurface is produced. Obviously, then, if in place of the kite-flyer\r\nholding the string and running at a certain speed, some kind of a motor\r\ncould be attached to the kite that would push it forward at a rate of\r\nspeed corresponding to the speed of the runner, the kite would rise--in\r\nshort, would be converted into a flying-machine.\r\n\r\nLooked at in another way, the action of the air in sustaining a body\r\nin motion in the air has been compared by Professor Langley to the\r\nsustaining power of thin ice, which does not break under the weight\r\nof a swiftly gliding skater, although it would sustain only a small\r\nfraction of his weight if he were stationary. Supposing, for example,\r\nthe skater were to stand upon a cake of ice a foot square for a single\r\nsecond; he would sink, let us say, to his waist in the water. On a cake\r\nhaving twice the surface area, or two square feet, he would sink only\r\nto his knees; while if the area of the cake is multiplied ten times\r\nthe original size, he would scarcely wet his feet in the period of a\r\nsecond. Now supposing the cake to be cut into ten cakes of one square\r\nfoot each, placed together in a line so that the skater could glide\r\nover the entire ten feet in length in one second. It is evident that\r\nhe would thus distribute his weight over the same amount of ice as if\r\nthe cakes were fastened together in a solid piece.\r\n\r\n\"So it is with the air,\" says Professor Langley. \"Even the viewless air\r\npossesses inertia; it cannot be pushed aside without some effort; and\r\nwhile the portion which is directly under the air-ship would not keep\r\nit from falling several yards in the first second, if the ship goes\r\nforward so that it runs or treads on thousands of such portions in that\r\ntime, it will sink in proportionately less degree; sink, perhaps only\r\nthrough a fraction of an inch.\"\r\n\r\nIt is evident, therefore, that if, at a given speed, the horizontal\r\nwings of an air-ship would keep it from falling more than a fraction of\r\nan inch in a second, by increasing the speed sufficiently and giving\r\nthe wings an upward inclination, the air-ship instead of falling might\r\nactually rise. And this, as we shall see presently, is just what the\r\nflying-machines of Sir Hiram Maxim and Professor Langley and of the\r\nWright brothers and their imitators did do.\r\n\r\n\r\nLANGLEY'S EARLY EXPERIMENTS AND DISCOVERIES\r\n\r\nIt was while making an important series of experiments with aeroplanes\r\nthat Professor Langley made the discovery which has since been known\r\nas \"Langley's Law.\" In effect this law is that while it takes a\r\ncertain strain to sustain a properly disposed weight while stationary\r\nin the air, to advance the weight rapidly takes _even less strain_\r\nthan when the weight is stationary. Thus, contrary to opinions held\r\nuntil recently, and contrary to the rules for land vehicles and ships,\r\nthe strain of resistance of an aeroplane will diminish instead of\r\nincreasing with the increase of speed. Professor Langley proved this\r\nremarkable fact with a most simple but ingenious device. It consisted\r\nof an immense \"whirling table,\" driven by an engine, so arranged that\r\nthe end of a revolving arm could be made to travel at any speed up\r\nto seventy miles an hour. At the end of this arm, surfaces disposed\r\nlike wings were placed, and whirled through the two hundred feet\r\ncircumference, until they were supported like kites by the resistance\r\nof the air.\r\n\r\nA certain strain was, of course, necessary to support one of these\r\nwinglike structures when stationary in the air, but, curiously enough,\r\nless strain was required when it was advanced rapidly. Thus a brass\r\nplate of proper shape weighing one pound was suspended from a pull-out\r\nspring scale, the arm of which was drawn out until it reached the\r\none-pound mark. When the whirling table was rotated with increasing\r\nvelocity the arm indicated less and less strain, finally indicating\r\nonly an ounce when the speed of a flying bird was reached. \"The brass\r\nplate seemed to float on the air,\" says Professor Langley, \"and not\r\nonly this, but taking into consideration both the strain and the\r\nvelocity, it was found that absolutely less power was spent to make the\r\nplate move fast than slow, a result which seemed very extraordinary,\r\nsince in all methods of land and water transport a high speed costs\r\nmuch more power than a slow one for the same distance.\"\r\n\r\nThese experiments, which destroyed the calculations of Newton, long\r\nheld to be correct, showed that mechanical flight was at least\r\ntheoretically possible, indicating as it did that a weight of two\r\nhundred pounds could be moved through the air at express-train\r\nspeed with the expenditure of only one horse-power of energy. Since\r\nengines could be constructed weighing less than twenty pounds to the\r\nhorse-power, theoretically such an engine should support ten times its\r\nown weight in horizontal flight in an absolute calm. As a matter of\r\nfact there is no such thing as an absolute calm in nature, air-currents\r\nbeing constantly stirring even on the calmest day, and this introduces\r\nanother element in attaining aerial flight that is an all-important\r\none. Indeed it has long been recognized that the mechanical power for\r\nflight is not the only requisite for flying--there is, besides, the art\r\nof handling that power.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPERIMENTS IN SOARING\r\n\r\nThose who have watched soaring birds sail for hours on rigidly extended\r\nwings will remember that while there is no flying movement, there are\r\ncertain shifts of the rigid body, either to offset some unexpected\r\ngust of wind, or to produce movement in a desired direction. There\r\nis an art of balancing here that has become instinctive in the bird\r\nby long practice which could not be hoped for in the same degree in\r\na mechanical device, and which man could hope to acquire only by\r\npractice. But in the nature of the case man has little chance to learn\r\nthis art of balancing in the air, and it is for this reason that the\r\nmany members of the balloonist school advocate the inflated bag in\r\nplace of the aeroplane. The argument advanced by them is that since\r\nman has no chance naturally to acquire familiarity with balancing in\r\nthe air, the simplest and best way for him to acquire it is by making\r\nballoon ascensions. When he has acquired sufficient skill he can\r\ngradually reduce the lifting part of his flying-machine, or gas-bag,\r\ngradually increasing the aeroplane or other means of propulsion and\r\nlifting, until the balloon part of his device can be dispensed with\r\nentirely.\r\n\r\nIn short, this argument of the balloon advocates is comparable to\r\ntwo schools of swimming-teachers, one of whom advocates the use of\r\nsustaining floats until the knack of swimming is acquired, the other\r\ndepending upon the use only of muscular movements and quickly acquired\r\nskill. In this comparison the aviators have all the best of the\r\nargument; for it is a common observation that persons who attempt to\r\nlearn to swim by the use of floats of any kind acquire that art slowly\r\nif at all; while those who plunge in boldly, although they run more\r\nrisks, quickly learn the art that seems ridiculously easy when once\r\nacquired.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LEARNING HOW TO FLY.\r\n\r\nThis gliding apparatus is not unlike that with which M. Chanute and\r\nother early experimenters tested the qualities of air currents. The\r\napparatus here shown is being drawn by an automobile, so that its\r\naction is virtually that of a kite. This picture was taken at Morris\r\nPark, New York, in 1909. The descent was made too abruptly and the\r\naviator was seriously injured.]\r\n\r\nThe great German scientist, Helmholtz, after years of careful study,\r\nfinally reached the conclusion that man would never be able to fly\r\nby his own power alone. But, as we have seen, Professor Langley had\r\nshown that in these mysterious questions pertaining to flight even a\r\nNewton could be wrong; and why not Helmholtz? Otto Lilienthal, also a\r\nGerman, thought that his fellow-countryman _was_ wrong. For years\r\nhe had made a study of the flight of birds, and his studies had led\r\nhim to the same conclusions that have usually been reached by every\r\nstudent of the subject, both before and since--that soaring flight,\r\nwithout any flapping movement, is possible under certain conditions;\r\nthat curved surfaces can acquire a horizontal motion by the action of\r\nthe wind alone, \"when their curvature bears a certain relation to their\r\nsuperficies\"--in short, a relation represented exactly by the wings of\r\nbirds.\r\n\r\nIt was not supposed by Lilienthal, or by any of the members of the\r\nschool of aviators, that simply by making a device that reproduced the\r\nproportions and shape of a bird any person might mount and fly. But it\r\nwas believed that, given such a device, a man might learn to fly with\r\npractice. Lilienthal, therefore, constructed a flying-machine with\r\ncorrectly curved surfaces made of linen stretched over a light wooden\r\nframe, the total area being about fourteen square yards, and the whole\r\nmachine weighing only about forty pounds. In the center was an aperture\r\nwhere the operator was stationed, holding the frame in position by\r\nhis arms. Obviously, as no flapping motion in imitation of a bird's\r\nwings was possible, some other means of giving the necessary impetus\r\nfor horizontal flight was necessary, and here again the study of birds\r\nsuggested a method.\r\n\r\nIt is a well-known fact that certain soaring birds cannot leave\r\nthe ground when once they have alighted, except by an initial run\r\nto acquire the necessary speed; and every goose hunter is familiar\r\nwith the manner in which these birds run along the surface of water,\r\nflapping their wings and skimming along some distance before they\r\nacquire sufficient velocity to mount into the air. A description of a\r\nsimilar action of an eagle in leaving the earth, written by a careful\r\nobserver a few years ago, has become classic. This huntsman had come\r\nupon an eagle which had alighted upon the sandy banks of the Nile, and\r\nhad fired at it, thus stimulating the bird to its utmost energy in\r\ngetting into flight. Yet on examining the foot-marks made in the sand\r\nit was found that, even under these circumstances, the bird had been\r\nobliged to run \"full twenty yards before he could raise himself from\r\nthe earth. The marks of his claws were traceable on the sandy soil,\"\r\nsays the writer, \"as, at first with firm and decided digs, he found his\r\nway, but as he lightened his body and increased his speed with the aid\r\nof his wings, the imprints of his talons gradually merged into long\r\nscratches.\"\r\n\r\nIt is evident that if such a master of the art of flying as an eagle\r\nmust thus acquire initial velocity before flight is possible, a human\r\nnovice must do considerably more. The method that would naturally\r\nsuggest itself would be that of running down the slope of a hillside,\r\nand Lilienthal adopted this method, beginning his flights by running\r\ndown the gentle slope of a hill against the wind, until the requisite\r\nmomentum was acquired. This was, indeed, a reversion to some of the\r\noldest types of flying-machines, but with this difference--that it was\r\nthe result of scientific study. The results attained proved that the\r\ntheory was not visionary--that scientists had not dreamed and studied\r\nin vain. For, as little by little the experimenter gained experience,\r\nhe was able to soar farther and farther in his birdlike machine, in\r\none flight sailing a distance of twelve hundred feet. Under certain\r\nfavorable wind conditions he could sail from a hilltop without the\r\ninitial run, and at times he actually rose in the air to a point higher\r\nthan that from which he started.\r\n\r\nAs was to be expected in the very nature of the case, Lilienthal found\r\nthat part of the secret of success lay in maintaining his equilibrium\r\nand in acquiring the faculty of doing this instinctively, as a bird\r\ndoes. But he found, like the person learning to ride a bicycle, that\r\nthis was developed by repeated efforts. The action of the machine\r\nitself was carefully studied, and various changes were made in his\r\napparatus from time to time as experience suggested them. Among other\r\nthings, feather-like sails, worked by a small motor, were attached to\r\nthe edge of the wings; and two smaller frames placed one above the\r\nother were tried in place of one large frame. And still the operator\r\ncontinued to make successful flights in all kinds of winds, sometimes\r\nnarrowly escaping disaster, but for three years always coming to\r\nthe ground safely. His confidence increased day by day, and as his\r\nremarkable performances multiplied it seemed as if it would only be a\r\nmatter of time until he would be able to imitate the soaring bird and\r\nsail almost as he pleased.\r\n\r\nIn writing of his experiences when, as it sometimes happened, he found\r\nhimself practically motionless in the air at a point higher than that\r\nfrom which he started, he says: \"I feel very certain that if I leaned a\r\nlittle to one side, and so described a circle, and further partook of\r\nthe motion of the lifting air around me, I should sustain my position.\r\nThe wind itself tends to direct this motion; but then it must be\r\nremembered that my chief object in the air is to overcome the tendency\r\nof turning to the right or left, because I know that behind or under\r\nme lies the hill from which I started, and with which I would come in\r\nrough contact if I allowed myself to attempt this circle-sailing. I\r\nhave, however, made up my mind, by means of either stronger wind or by\r\nflapping the wings, to get higher up and farther away from the hills,\r\nso that sailing round in circles, I can follow the strong, uplifting\r\ncurrent, and have sufficient air-space under and around me to complete\r\nwith safety a circle, and lastly to come up against the wind again to\r\nland.\"\r\n\r\nBefore he was ready to make this attempt, however, Lilienthal was\r\nkilled by a fall caused by a treacherous gust of wind which tilted his\r\nmachine beyond his control and hurled him to the ground.\r\n\r\nAgain the expectant world of aerial navigators was thrown into\r\ndespondency by the happening of the long expected--expected, and yet\r\nnot expected; for Lilienthal had made so many daring flights under\r\nso many trying conditions, always managing to alight safely, that a\r\nfeeling of confidence had succeeded that of distrust. It was almost\r\nlike a bolt from a clear sky, therefore, when the news was flashed\r\naround the world that Lilienthal was no more. But science has never yet\r\nbeen daunted by the fear of death. Like a well-formed battle-line in\r\nwhich the place of the fallen is always quickly filled, there is always\r\na warrior-scientist ready to sacrifice anything for the cause. And so,\r\nalthough Lilienthal was gone, the work he had carried so far toward\r\nsuccess was continued by others, Chanute and Hering, the American\r\n\"soaring men,\" and later eclipsed by the Wright brothers, who were\r\nfinally to solve the problem.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FLYING MACHINES OF MAXIM AND LANGLEY\r\n\r\nAt the same time that Lilienthal was making his initial experiments,\r\nanother champion of the same school of aviators was achieving equally\r\nsuccessful results along somewhat different, and yet on the whole,\r\nsimilar lines. Sir Hiram Maxim, the inventor of so many destructive\r\ntypes of guns, was devoting much time and energy to the construction\r\nof a flying-machine. His apparatus was of the aeroplane type, but\r\nunlike that of Lilienthal, Chanute, or Hering, was to be propelled by\r\nsteam-driven screw-propellers. Nor was the apparatus he proposed to\r\nmake a diminutive affair weighing a few pounds and capable of lifting\r\nonly the weight of a man. His huge machine weighed in the neighborhood\r\nof four tons and carried a steam-engine that developed some three\r\nhundred and sixty horse-power in the screws. It was two hundred feet\r\nin width, and mounted on a car track, along which it was to be run to\r\nacquire the necessary initial velocity before mounting into the air.\r\n\r\nOn July 31, 1894, this huge machine started on a trial spin, carrying\r\na crew of three persons, besides fuel and water for the boilers. When\r\na speed of thirty-six miles an hour on the track had been acquired,\r\nthe apparatus lifted itself in the air, and sailed for some distance,\r\na maximum flight of over three hundred feet finally being made. This\r\nexperiment demonstrated several important things--in fact, solved\r\n\"three out of five divisions of the problem of flight,\" as Lord Kelvin\r\ndeclared. It demonstrated that a flying-machine carrying its own\r\npropelling power could be made powerful and light enough to lift itself\r\nin the air; that an aeroplane will lift much more than a balloon of\r\nequal weight; and that a well-made screw-propeller will grip the air\r\nsufficiently to propel a machine at a high rate of speed.\r\n\r\nSince the two remaining divisions of the five concerned in the problem\r\nof flight had been already solved by Lilienthal, it seemed that it only\r\nremained for some scientist to combine this complete knowledge in the\r\nproper way to produce a practical flying-machine--one that would fly\r\nthrough the air, and continue to fly until the power was exhausted. It\r\nwas not a startling announcement to the scientific world, therefore,\r\nwhen about three years later the news was flashed that Prof. S. P.\r\nLangley had produced such an apparatus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FLYING MACHINES OF THE MONOPLANE TYPE.\r\n\r\nUpper figure, the aeroplane of M. Robert Esnault-Pelterie. Middle\r\nfigure, the aeroplane of M. Blériot. Lower figure, the Vuia aeroplane,\r\na bat-like machine of freakish structure which had no large measure of\r\nsuccess. A modification of the boat-like machine shown in the upper\r\nfigure gained celebrity through its use by M. Latham in the first\r\nattempt (in July, 1909) to fly across the English Channel. M. Blériot's\r\naeroplane as finally developed became a very successful flying machine.\r\nWith its aid M. Blériot was first to accomplish the feat of flying\r\nacross the English Channel (from Calais to Dover in about 23 minutes)\r\non the morning of July 25th, 1909. These pictures are reproduced from\r\nthe London Graphic of January 25th, 1908.]\r\n\r\nProfessor Langley described this really wonderful machine, which he\r\ncalled the \"aerodrome,\" as follows:\r\n\r\n\"In the completed form there are two pairs of wings, each slightly\r\ncurved, each attached to a long steel rod which supports them both, and\r\nfrom which depends the body of the machine, in which are the boilers,\r\nthe engines, the machinery, and the propeller wheels, these latter\r\nbeing not in the position of an ocean steamer, but more nearly\r\namidships. They are made sometimes of wood, sometimes of steel and\r\ncanvas, and are between three and four feet in diameter.\r\n\r\n\"The hull itself is formed of steel tubing; the front portion is closed\r\nby a sheathing of metal which hides from view the fire-grate and\r\napparatus for heating, but allows us to see a little of the coils of\r\nthe boiler and all of the relatively large smokestack in which it ends.\r\nThere is a conical vessel in front which is simply an empty float,\r\nwhose use is to keep the whole from sinking if it should fall in the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n\"This boiler supplies steam for an engine of between one and one-half\r\nhorse-power, and, with its fire-grate, weighs a little over five\r\npounds. This weight is exclusive of that of the engine, which weighs,\r\nwith all its moving parts, but twenty-six ounces. Its duty is to drive\r\nthe propeller wheels, which it does at rates varying from 800 to 1,200,\r\nor even more, turns a minute, the highest number being reached when the\r\nwhole is speeding freely ahead.\r\n\r\n\"The rudder is of a shape very unlike that of a ship, for it is adapted\r\nboth for vertical and horizontal steering. The width of the wings from\r\ntip to tip is between twelve and thirteen feet, and the length of the\r\nwhole about sixteen feet. The weight is nearly thirty pounds, of which\r\nabout one-fourth is contained in the machinery. The engine and boilers\r\nare constructed with an almost single eye to economy of weight, not\r\nof force, and are very wasteful of steam, of which they spend their\r\nown weight in five minutes. This steam might all be recondensed and\r\nthe water re-used by proper condensing apparatus, but this cannot be\r\neasily introduced in so small a scale of construction. With it the time\r\nof flight might be hours instead of minutes, but without it the flight\r\n(of the present aerodrome) is limited to about five minutes, though in\r\nthat time, as will be seen presently, it can go some miles; but owing\r\nto the danger of its leaving the surface of the water for that of the\r\nland, and wrecking itself on shore, the time of flight is limited\r\ndesignedly to less than two minutes.\"\r\n\r\nWhen this flying-machine was put to the actual test its performance\r\njustified the most sanguine expectations; it actually flew as no other\r\nmachine had ever flown before. A number of men of science watched\r\nthis remarkable performance, among others Alexander Graham Bell,\r\nthe inventor of the telephone, who reported it to the Institute of\r\nFrance. \"Through the courtesy of Mr. S. P. Langley, Secretary of the\r\nSmithsonian Institution, I have had on various occasions the pleasure\r\nof witnessing his experiments with aerodromes,\" wrote Dr. Bell, \"and\r\nespecially the remarkable success attained by him in his experiments\r\nmade on the Potomac River on Wednesday, May 6th [which led me to urge\r\nhim to make public some of these results].\r\n\r\n\"On the occasion referred to, the aerodrome, at a given signal, started\r\nfrom a platform about twenty feet above the water, and rose at first\r\ndirectly in the face of the wind, moving at all times with remarkable\r\nsteadiness, and subsequently swinging around in large curves of,\r\nperhaps, a hundred yards in diameter, and continually ascending until\r\nits steam was exhausted, when at a lapse of about a minute and a half,\r\nand at a height which I judged to be between eighty and one hundred\r\nfeet in the air, the wheels ceased turning, and the machine, deprived\r\nof the aid of propellers, to my surprise did not fall, but settled down\r\nso softly and gently that it touched the water without the least shock,\r\nand was in fact immediately ready for another trial.\"\r\n\r\nTo most persons, even to the cautious and scientific inventor himself,\r\nthe performance of this, and a second aerodrome which flew about\r\nthree-quarters of a mile, seemed to show that the secret of aerial\r\nnavigation was all but fathomed. \"The world, indeed, will be supine,\"\r\nLangley wrote a short time after the success of his flying-machine, \"if\r\nit does not realize that a new possibility has come to it, and that\r\nthe great universal highway overhead is soon to be opened.\" What could\r\nbe plainer? A machine of a certain construction, weighing some thirty\r\npounds, and carrying at that some excess of weight, had been able to\r\nfly a relatively long distance. What easier than to construct a machine\r\non precisely similar lines only ten, a hundred, a thousand times\r\nlarger, until it would carry persons and cargo, and fly across an ocean\r\nor a continent?\r\n\r\nProfessor Langley himself, as was most fitting, undertook the\r\nconstruction of such a man-carrying air-ship. And it was during this\r\nundertaking that he made the momentous discovery that seemed to\r\noppose a question mark to the possibility of flight by the aeroplane\r\nprinciple. This discovery was an \"unyielding mathematical law that\r\nthe weight of such a machine increases as the cube of its dimensions,\r\nwhereas the wing surface increases as the square.\" In other words, as\r\nthe machine is made larger, the size of the wings must be increased\r\nin an alarmingly disproportionate ratio. And the best that Professor\r\nLangley's man-carrying flying-machine could do, after the inventor had\r\nexpended the limit of his ingenuity, was to dive into the waters of\r\nChesapeake Bay, instead of soaring through the air as its prototype,\r\nthe aerodrome, had done.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE IMPOSSIBLE ACCOMPLISHED\r\n\r\nThe plunge of Langley's aerodrome downward into the water instead of\r\nupward through space as had been confidently expected, carried with\r\nit the hopes of a great number of hitherto enthusiasts, who were now\r\ninclined to believe that the practical conquest of the air was almost\r\nas far beyond our reach as it had been beyond that of all preceding\r\ngenerations. Learned scientists were able to prove to their own\r\nsatisfaction, by long columns of figures and elaborate mathematical\r\ncalculations, that the air is unconquerable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE WRIGHT AEROPLANE.\r\n\r\nThe aeroplane is here shown at rest, facing the right. This is the\r\noriginal type of bi-plane flying machines, of which all the others are\r\nonly modifications. The starting-rail along which the machine glides\r\nwhile acquiring momentum is seen at the right; the rope connecting\r\nit with the starting derrick, at the left. The sledge-like runners,\r\nintended to break the shock of alighting, are plainly shown. The\r\nparallel planes of canvas at the right are horizontal rudders to direct\r\nthe machine upward or downward. The vertical planes at the left are\r\nactive rudders to direct the machine laterally. The two paddle-like\r\nstructures at the back of the machine are the wooden propellers,\r\nactuated (at a rate of from 1000 to 1400 revolutions per minute) by\r\nan oil motor. With a machine of this type the Wright brothers, of\r\nDayton, Ohio, were the first to demonstrate the feasibility of aerial\r\nnavigation with a heavier-than-air machine; and world-famous flights\r\nwere made by Mr. Orville Wright at Washington and by Mr. Wilbur Wright\r\nin France in the summer of 1908.]\r\n\r\nBut even as they labored and promulgated these conclusions, two\r\nunknown men in a little Ohio town, discarding all accepted theoretical\r\ncalculations, and combining with their newly created tables of figures\r\na rare quality of practical application and unswerving courage, had\r\naccomplished the impossible. Wilbur and Orville Wright--two names\r\nthat must always be linked with those of Fulton and Stephenson, only\r\npossibly on a higher plane as conquerors of a more subtle element--were\r\nat that very time making flights in all directions at will through the\r\nair in their practical flying-machine. While others caviled and\r\ndoubted, these two modest inventors worked and accomplished; until\r\npresently they were able to put in evidence a mechanism that may\r\nperhaps without exaggeration be regarded as the harbinger of a new era\r\nof civilization.\r\n\r\nThe interest of these two brothers in the fascinating field of air\r\nnavigation was first excited when, as boys, their father, a clergyman,\r\nbrought home for their amusement the little toy known to scientists\r\nas a \"hélicoptère,\" which, actuated by twisted rubbers that drive\r\ntiny paper screws in opposite directions, actually rises and flutters\r\nthrough the air. \"A toy so delicate lasted only a short time in\r\nthe hands of small boys, but its memory was abiding\" the inventors\r\nthemselves have tersely said. So abiding, indeed, that a few years\r\nlater they began making similar \"bats,\" as they had dubbed the machines.\r\n\r\nSoon they discovered that the larger the machine they made the less it\r\nflew, and in pondering this fact they gradually evolved for themselves\r\nthe theory which is now known as Langley's unyielding mathematical\r\nlaw, referred to a few pages back. The problem of human flight had not\r\nbeen considered by them at this time, and it was not until the news of\r\nLilienthal's death startled the world that they entered the field of\r\ninvention in earnest. Then they began constructing gliding machines,\r\nmodifications of those of Lilienthal and Chanute, and began making long\r\nflights, studying defects and overcoming adverse conditions as they\r\npresented themselves.\r\n\r\nBy 1901, they had surpassed the performances of all predecessors,\r\nyet, as they tell us, \"we saw that the calculations upon which all\r\nflying-machines had been based were unreliable, and that all were\r\nsimply groping in the dark. Having set out with absolute faith in the\r\nexisting scientific data, we were driven to doubt one thing after\r\nanother, till finally, after two years of experiment, we cast it all\r\naside, and decided to rely entirely upon our own investigations.\r\nTruth and error were everywhere so intimately mixed as to be\r\nindistinguishable. Nevertheless, the time expended in preliminary\r\nstudy of books was not misspent, for they gave us a good general\r\nunderstanding of the subject, and enabled us at the outset to avoid\r\neffort in many directions in which results would have been hopeless.\"\r\n\r\nFrom mere gliding machines without self-contained power the brothers\r\nprogressed through the various stages of achievement until in the\r\nfall of 1903 they had created the type of flying-machine now made so\r\nfamiliar to everyone through the pictorial publications. Incidentally\r\nthey had invented and constructed their own gasoline motor for\r\nfurnishing the power--an accomplishment of no mean importance in\r\nitself. On December 17th, 1903, in the presence of a small company of\r\nwitnesses who had braved the cold, the Wright machine, carrying one\r\nof the brothers, made a short but successful flight--the first ever\r\naccomplished in which a machine carrying a passenger had raised itself\r\nby its own power, sailed a certain distance in free flight, yet subject\r\nto guidance, and landed itself and its passenger safely. Mr. Hiram\r\nMaxim's machine had, indeed, lifted itself and its passengers, but it\r\nsailed unguided through the air, and it could in no sense be said to\r\nhave made a flight comparable to that of a bird or a bat. The Wright\r\nmachine, on the other hand, progressed through the air under guidance\r\nof its passenger, rising or settling, or turning to right or left as he\r\nwished. Its progress constituted, in other words, a veritable flight.\r\n\r\nYet the problem of perfectly controlled flight under all ordinary\r\nconditions was by no means completely mastered. The principle was\r\ncorrect, but there were endless details to be worked out. The\r\nembodiment of these is the Wright flying-machine of the present time.\r\n\r\nIn the Wright aeroplane the lifting power is obtained by two parallel\r\nhorizontal planes of canvas stretched over retaining-frames, placed\r\nwith their long diameters transversely to the direction of flight, as\r\nin the case of the wings of a bird. At a little distance, in front of\r\nthese, are placed two horizontal parallel rudders, and at the back two\r\nparallel vertical rudders. The machine is mounted on huge skids, which\r\nresemble giant sled-runners in shape, but lighter and more flexible,\r\nand is driven by two wooden-bladed propellers not unlike some of the\r\ntypes of ship-propellers. For stability in flight under all kinds of\r\natmospheric conditions this machine has shown itself to be a true\r\nflying-machine, capable of navigating the air in any direction at\r\nthe will of the operator, and remaining in flight a length of time\r\ndependent entirely upon the amount of fuel carried.\r\n\r\nThe stability of this machine, particularly in a transverse direction,\r\nhas proved far greater than that of any of its predecessors or\r\ncontemporaries. The two horizontal rudder-planes mounted in front\r\nmaintain the fore-and-aft stability; while keeping the machine on an\r\neven keel is accomplished by varying the angle of incidence by warping\r\nthe two main planes,--this being, indeed, a vitally important feature\r\nof the mechanism. In this manner a greater lift on the low side and a\r\ndiminished lift on the high side is obtained, this being maintained\r\nmanually, as is the fore-and-aft stability. Since the warping of the\r\nwings of the machine would tend to deflect it from its course, the\r\napparatus is so arranged that a single lever controls the flexible\r\nportion of the wings and the vertical rudder, the motion of the latter\r\ncounteracting the disturbing influence that would otherwise result\r\nfrom the twisting of the wing-tips. The discovery of this combination\r\ngave the finishing touches to the aeroplane, and made it a manageable\r\nmechanism. In other words, it made the flying machine a machine in\r\nwhich man could fly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MR. WILBUR WRIGHT PREPARING TO ASCEND IN HIS AEROPLANE\r\nWITH HIS PUPIL M. CASSANDIER.]\r\n\r\nThis mechanism was patented in 1906, and the patent office\r\nspecifications then became accessible to other experimenters. The\r\nFrench scientific workers had for some time recognized the success\r\nof the Wright brothers' efforts, even when most Americans were\r\nstill skeptical. Now that the manner in which this success had been\r\nobtained was disclosed, numerous experimenters began copying the\r\nWright brothers' successful machine, making sundry modifications,\r\nwhile still adhering to the main principles through which success had\r\nbeen obtained. The first of these experimenters to win conspicuous\r\nsuccess was Mr. Henry Farman, an Englishman residing in Paris, who on\r\nthe 13th of January, 1908, aroused the enthusiasm of the entire world,\r\nand won a £2000 prize, by flying in a heavier-than-air machine in a\r\nprescribed circle, covering about sixteen hundred yards, and alighting\r\nat the starting-point.\r\n\r\nThis was more than four years after the Wright brothers had made far\r\nmore remarkable flights, to which few persons had paid any attention,\r\nand of which most people had never heard. But in the autumn of the\r\nsame year Orville Wright in America, and Wilbur Wright in France began\r\na series of public flights which demonstrated for all time that the\r\nair at last had been conquered, and that they were the unquestionable\r\nconquerors. Orville, at Fort Myer, near Washington, on September\r\n12th, electrified the world by flying continuously around a circular\r\ncourse for an hour and fifteen minutes. This was the most conclusive\r\nperformance yet accomplished and set at rest all doubts as to the\r\npossibility of mechanical flight. For no one could doubt that a machine\r\nwhich could maintain itself in the air by its own power for more than\r\nan hour was truly a flying-machine in the most exacting sense of the\r\nterm.\r\n\r\nA few days after this performance an accident to the propeller of\r\nthis machine wrecked it, the resulting fall breaking the leg of the\r\ninventor, and killing his companion, Lieutenant Selfridge of the United\r\nStates Army.\r\n\r\nAlmost simultaneously Wilbur Wright began a series of flights at\r\nLe Mans, France, which demonstrated still more conclusively that\r\nerstwhile earth-bound man had really learned to fly. His longest flight\r\nlasted for two hours, twenty minutes, and twenty-three seconds; while\r\nby flying over captive balloons at an altitude of three hundred and\r\nsixty feet, he demonstrated that the mere matter of altitude offered no\r\nobstacle.\r\n\r\nFrom this time forward the number of aeronauts increased day by day,\r\nand new records were made in bewildering confusion. Only a few of the\r\nmore spectacular of these need be referred to. On July 19, 1909, Hubert\r\nLatham attempted a flight across the English Channel, but his motor\r\nfailed him and his machine plunged into the water, from which, however,\r\nhe was rescued, having suffered no injury. On July 25th, Louis Blériot\r\nmade a similar attempt with better results. Starting from the cliffs\r\nnear Calais he made the passage without mishap and landed near Dover.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FARMAN AEROPLANE.\r\n\r\nThis is the machine with which Mr. Farman, an Englishman living in\r\nFrance, won the Deutsch prize in the early spring of 1908. This\r\nperformance was notable as being the most important public flight\r\nhitherto made by a heavier-than-air machine. The Wright brothers of\r\nDayton, Ohio, had made numerous flights of far greater length, but the\r\ngeneral public was not aware of that fact and for a time Mr. Farman was\r\npopularly regarded as the foremost of aviators. His best performances\r\nwere, however, eclipsed by the public flights of the Wright brothers a\r\nfew months later.]\r\n\r\nThere was of course no particular difficulty involved in the flight\r\nacross the Channel; but its obvious dangers, together with the\r\nsuggestion as to the new possibilities of the use of the airship in war\r\ntime,--the virtual elimination of that all-important barrier of water\r\nthat had proved so effective against England's foes in the past,--gave\r\nto Blériot's flight a popular interest not exceeded by any preceding\r\nachievement even of the Wright brothers. We may add that Blériot's\r\nfeat was presently duplicated by another Frenchman, Count Jacques de\r\nLesseps by name, who crossed the Channel in an aeroplane in May, 1910;\r\nand excelled by the Hon. Charles S. Rolls, an Englishman, who on June\r\n2nd, 1910, made a still more remarkable flight, in which he crossed\r\nthe Channel, starting from the cliffs near Dover, and after circling\r\nover French soil without landing, returned to his starting-place. The\r\naeroplanes used by the two Frenchmen were of the monoplane type; that\r\nused by Mr. Rolls was a Wright bi-plane.\r\n\r\nJust at the time when the first successful cross-Channel flight was\r\nmade, the attention of aviators was focussed on the flights being made\r\nnear Washington by Mr. Orville Wright in the attempt to fulfill the\r\nGovernment tests which had been so tragically interrupted the year\r\nbefore. On July 27th, 1909, Mr. Wright successfully met the conditions\r\nof the endurance test, by flying more than an hour carrying as a\r\npassenger Lieutenant Frank P. Lahm. Three days later a more spectacular\r\nflight, to a distance of five miles across country and return, over\r\ntree-tops, hills, and valleys, with a passenger (Lieutenant Foulois),\r\nwas accomplished without mishap. This was in many respects the most\r\nimportant flight, as suggesting the possible practical utility of the\r\naeroplane, that had hitherto been made.\r\n\r\nLater in the same year Mr. Orville Wright went abroad with his\r\naeroplane and made a large number of flights at Berlin, demonstrating\r\nto the German people the points of superiority of the aeroplane as\r\nagainst the gigantic dirigible balloons to which that nation had\r\nheretofore paid chief attention. Mr. Wilbur Wright meantime remained in\r\nAmerica to give flights about New York Harbor during the Hudson-Fulton\r\nCentenary Celebration. On October 4th (1909), he made a sensational\r\nflight up the Hudson from Governor's Island, circling about above the\r\nwarships anchored in the river in the neighborhood of Grant's Tomb, and\r\nreturning to land at his starting-point. What would probably have been\r\na still more spectacular flight was prevented by an accident to Mr.\r\nWright's motor just as he was about to start on the afternoon of the\r\nsame day.\r\n\r\nAnother flight that aroused great popular interest and enthusiasm was\r\nmade by the Frenchman Louis Paulhan in competition for a prize of\r\nten thousand pounds offered by the Daily Mail of London for a flight\r\nfrom London to Manchester. Paulhan left London at 5:20 on the evening\r\nof April 28, 1910. He descended at Litchfield but renewed his flight\r\nearly next morning, arriving at Manchester at 8:10. He had covered the\r\ndistance of 186 miles with a single stop, his actual flying time being\r\nfour hours and eleven minutes, or an average rate of 44.3 miles an\r\nhour. In this flight M. Paulhan had for his only competitor Mr. White,\r\nan Englishman, who made a daring flight but did not cover the entire\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nPaulhan had previously been known as one of the most daring of\r\naviators. At Los Angeles, California, on January 13, 1910, he rose to a\r\nheight of about 4,163 feet, establishing a record for altitude. He had\r\nalso made thrilling cross-country flights on the occasion of the Los\r\nAngeles meet, as well as in France. Paulhan's record flights were made\r\nin a Farman bi-plane.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MONOPLANES OF BLÉRIOT AND LATHAM.\r\n\r\nThe upper figure is that of Blériot launched for his flight across the\r\nEnglish Channel, on July 25th, 1909. The lower shows Latham starting in\r\nan attempt to cross the Channel, which barely failed of success through\r\nfault of the motor.]\r\n\r\nThe spectacular flight from London to Manchester was matched soon\r\nafter by Mr. Glenn H. Curtiss' flight from Albany to New York, which\r\ntook place May 29, 1910. Mr. Curtiss had already achieved fame as an\r\naviator, having won the chief speed contest in the International\r\nAviation Meet held at Rheims in August, 1909. He used a bi-plane of\r\nhis own construction, differing but little in design from the Wright\r\nmachine, but of very small size, and propelled by an eight-cylinder\r\nmotor, also made by Mr. Curtiss himself. The start from Albany was\r\nmade at three minutes after seven o'clock and the aviator arrived at\r\nGovernor's Island, New York Harbor, at twelve o'clock, having stopped\r\ntwice on the way to rest and take on fuel. The first stop was made\r\nnear Poughkeepsie, the second on the heights near the Hudson, within\r\nthe bounds of New York City. The distance covered 142½ miles; the\r\nactual time of flight, 2 hours and 54 minutes,--an average speed\r\nof about fifty miles an hour. Parts of the flight were made at a\r\ngood deal better speed. The first part of the journey from Albany\r\nto Poughkeepsie, a distance of 74¼ miles, was covered in 1 hour 23\r\nminutes, or at a rate of more than 53.68 miles an hour. The minimum\r\nspeed at which Mr. Curtiss' bi-plane could be maintained in the\r\nair is about 40 miles an hour, the supporting surface of its main\r\nplane comprising only 236 square feet, and the weight of the machine\r\ncomplete, including aviator, fuel, and oil, being 950 pounds. The\r\nmachine uses a single propeller, 7 feet in diameter, making 1,100\r\nrevolutions per minute, and giving a pull, when the machine is held\r\nstationary on the ground, of over 300 lbs. The engine used is an\r\neight-cylinder motor of 50 horse-power.\r\n\r\nA flight in some respects even more interesting than that of Mr.\r\nCurtiss was accomplished in France on the ninth of June, 1910, by\r\nLieutenant Feguant and Captain Marconnet, officers of the French army,\r\non a Farman bi-plane. \"Starting from Chalons at 4:40 A. M.,\" says the\r\n_Scientific American_, \"the officers flew 176 kilometers (109¼ miles)\r\nacross country to the artillery park at Vincennes, which was reached at\r\n7:10. This flight of two and one-half hours' duration was accomplished\r\nat a speed of 43¾ miles per hour. Captain Marconnet was able to take\r\nphotographs and make sketches that would have been of great strategic\r\ninterest in time of war. This is the first practical demonstration of\r\nthe aeroplane for scouting purposes, in addition to its being a new\r\nworld's record for cross-country flying with two men in the machine.\r\nAnother French aviator, Labouchère, flew for ten minutes with two\r\npassengers at Mourmelon on the same day.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A BRITISH AEROPLANE.\r\n\r\nThis apparatus was built and is operated by Colonel Cody of the British\r\nArmy. It has made flights of a mile or more. With minor modifications\r\nit is, like all bi-plane flying machines hitherto constructed, of the\r\nWright aeroplane type.]\r\n\r\nA record flight of yet another character was accomplished in America\r\nby Charles K. Hamilton, a disciple of Curtiss, who, flying under\r\nthe auspices of the New York _Times_ and the Philadelphia _Public\r\nLedger_, attempted successfully a round-trip flight from New York to\r\nPhiladelphia on June 14, 1910. The aviator left Governor's Island at\r\n7:36 A. M. and landed at Philadelphia at 9:26 A. M., having covered the\r\n86 miles at an average speed of 46.92 miles an hour. After delivering\r\nmessages from the Governor of New York, and the Mayor of New York City,\r\nMr. Hamilton took wing at 11:33 for the return voyage. A difficulty\r\nwith his motor made it necessary for him to descend at South Amboy,\r\nafter covering 68 miles in 1 hour and 21 minutes. An injury to the\r\npropeller necessitated a delay of several hours, but the aviator was\r\nenabled to re-ascend at 6:17 and to land at Governor's Island at 6:40,\r\nthe return journey having been accomplished at an average hourly speed\r\nof 51.36 miles.\r\n\r\nThe machine used by Mr. Hamilton is a Curtiss bi-plane, which in most\r\nrespects follows closely the model of the original Wright aeroplane,\r\nbut in which the function of the warping wings is fulfilled by two\r\nsmall wings, or ailerons, adjusted at each side between the larger\r\nplanes. These ailerons, being deflected in opposite directions\r\nsimultaneously, meet any tendency of the machine to tip unduly.\r\nWhether or not this method of maintaining lateral stability is the\r\nsame in principle as the Wright method of warping the large planes\r\nthemselves, is a question at issue between the inventors. From the\r\npurely scientific standpoint it would seem that one method is merely a\r\nmodification of the other, which, however ingenious in its application,\r\nintroduces no new principle.\r\n\r\nOn the same day on which Mr. Hamilton's inter-urban flight took\r\nplace, a new record for altitude was made at Indianapolis by Mr. W.\r\nH. Brookins, a pupil of the Wrights, who rose in the Wright bi-plane\r\nto a height of 4,384 feet. The height was calculated by President\r\nLambert of the St. Louis Aero Club, with the aid of a sextant. Earlier\r\nin the same day Mr. Brookins had risen about 2,000 feet. It becomes\r\nincreasingly difficult for an aeroplane to rise to great heights owing\r\nto rarefaction of the upper atmosphere, but the flights of Paulhan\r\nand Brookins, as well as various unmeasured altitudes attained in\r\ncross-country flights, show that the aeroplane as at present equipped\r\nmay be depended upon to rise well toward the mile limit.\r\n\r\nThese are but a few of the interesting flights made within a brief\r\nperiod after the Wright brothers' first successful demonstrations.\r\nThe number of the aviators who so quickly entered the field, and the\r\nprominence given by the press to such feats as those of Blériot,\r\nPaulhan, and Curtiss, have tended to distract attention from the\r\noriginal inventors, and to produce some confusion in the popular mind\r\nas to the exact share the various aviators have taken in the conquest\r\nof the air. The facts, however, are quite clear and unequivocal. At\r\nthe time when the Wright brothers made their first successful flights,\r\ncomparatively few people in the world believed that anyone would ever\r\nbe able to propel himself through the air with safety or certainty in a\r\nheavier-than-air apparatus.\r\n\r\nThe Wright brothers solved the problem after years of patient effort,\r\nand solved it effectively and conclusively. They profited of course by\r\nthe efforts of predecessors, but they were the inventors of the airship\r\nin a far fuller sense than, for example, Fulton was the inventor of the\r\nsteamboat, or Stephenson of the locomotive, or Morse of the telegraph.\r\nTo their success, and to that alone, must be ascribed the fact that\r\nmany scores of men in various parts of the world are now able to fly\r\nin aeroplanes. Slight modifications of type mark various of these\r\naeroplanes, but no radical departure in principle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mr. Wilbur Wright flying over New York Harbor, October\r\n4, 1909.]\r\n\r\nIn time, no doubt, flying-machines of quite different types will be\r\ninvented. Quite possibly the machines of the Wright model will\r\nbecome altogether obsolete. But this can have no possible effect upon\r\nthe position that the Wright brothers themselves must always hold in\r\nthe history of scientific progress. The men who fly from New York\r\nto San Francisco, or from New York to London, will be carrying out\r\nthe work of the Dayton pioneers; and no future accomplishment of the\r\nheavier-than-air machine can possibly rank in historical importance\r\nwith that first flight in the presence of witnesses made December 17,\r\n1903. Then and there it was successfully demonstrated that the last\r\ndifficulty, so far as joining theory and practice was concerned, had\r\nbeen mastered. Potentially, from that moment, the conquest of the air\r\nwas complete; and the names of the conquerors as all the world knows,\r\nand as throughout the future all must remember, are Wilbur and Orville\r\nWright.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\nREFERENCE LIST AND NOTES\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE HIGHWAY OF THE WATERS\r\n\r\n(pp. 77-79).
