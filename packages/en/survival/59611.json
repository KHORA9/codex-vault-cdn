Unfortunately when attention\r\nbegan to be sedulously given to the study of these ancient formations,\r\nthe problems of metamorphism were still a hundred fold more obscure\r\nthan they have since become; the aid of the microscope had not been\r\nseriously and systematically adopted for the investigation of the\r\ncrystalline schists, and geologists generally were still under the\r\nbelief that the broad structure of these schists could be treated like\r\nthose of the sedimentary rocks, and be determined by rapid traverses of\r\nthe ground. We have now painfully discovered that these older methods\r\nof observation were extremely crude, and that the work performed in\r\naccordance with them is now of little interest or value save as a\r\nhistorical warning to future generations of geologists. Geological\r\nliterature has meanwhile been burdened with numerous contributions\r\nwhich remain as a permanent incubus on our library shelves.\r\n\r\nIt may serve a useful purpose at the present time in possibly aiding\r\nthose who are engaged in the study of the oldest rocks of North\r\nAmerica, if I place before them, as briefly as possible, the main facts\r\nwhich in my opinion have now been satisfactorily proved regarding the\r\ncorresponding rocks of Britain, and if I indicate at the same time some\r\nof the more probable inferences in those cases where the facts, at\r\npresent known, do not warrant a definite conclusion.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that in any effort to establish that a group of rocks is\r\nolder than the very base of the sedimentary fossiliferous formations,\r\nwe must somewhere find that group emerging from under the bottom of\r\nthese formations. Until lithological characters are ascertained to be\r\nso distinctive and constant as to be comparable to fossil evidence\r\nfor purposes of stratigraphical identification, we should not assume\r\nthat detached areas of older rocks rising amid Palæozoic, Secondary or\r\nTertiary formations are pre-Cambrian. We should, if possible, begin\r\nat the bottom of the Palæozoic systems and work backward, tracing\r\neach successive system or group as these rise from under each other,\r\nuntil we arrive at what appears to be the oldest traceable within\r\nthe region of observation. It is clear that in the present state of\r\nknowledge we have no satisfactory means of identifying such successive\r\nsystems in widely separated countries. All that can be attempted in\r\nthe meantime is to ascertain the special types in each region, and to\r\npoint out their general resemblances or contrasts to those of other\r\nregions. It is better to avoid confusion by refraining from applying\r\nthe stratigraphical names adopted for the oldest rocks of one region\r\nto those of another geographically remote, though we may hope that\r\neventually it may be possible to work out the equivalence of these\r\nlocal names.\r\n\r\nIn the British Isles, by much the most important region for the study\r\nof the oldest rocks is to be found in the north-west Highlands of\r\nScotland. The very basement strata of the Cambrian system are there\r\ntraceable for a distance of more than 100 miles, reposing with a\r\nstrong unconformability upon all rocks of older date. They consist\r\nof dolomitic shales with _Olenellus_, resting upon a thick group of\r\nquartzites, full of annelid tubes. One of the most remarkable features\r\nof these ancient strata is the persistence of their component bands\r\nor zones which, though sometimes only a few feet thick, can be traced\r\nthroughout the whole tract of country just referred to. For the study\r\nof the pre-Cambrian rocks this is an important point, for we can be\r\nquite certain that even where fossil evidence locally fails, the same\r\nbasement members of the Cambrian system are persistent and lie directly\r\nupon the pre-Cambrian series.\r\n\r\n_Lewisian Gneiss._ Ever since the researches of Murchison and Nicol in\r\nthe north-west of Scotland, it has been known that two distinct systems\r\nof rock underlie the quartzites to which I have just alluded. Murchison\r\nregarded the upper of these as of Cambrian age, while he assigned the\r\nunconformable quartzites and limestones above it to the Lower Silurian\r\nperiod. But the recent discovery of the _Olenellus_ zone intercalated\r\nconformably between the quartzites and the overlying limestones may be\r\nregarded as proving that all the rocks which underlie the quartzites\r\nand are separated from them by a strong unconformability must be\r\npre-Cambrian. It is thus established beyond any reasonable doubt that\r\ntwo great pre-Cambrian systems of rock exist in the north-west of\r\nScotland.\r\n\r\nThese two systems differ so entirely from each other that their\r\nrespective areas can be defined with minute accuracy. The uppermost\r\nconsists chiefly of dull reddish sandstones with conglomerates, and\r\nespecially towards their base in Rosshire, some bands of dark grey\r\nshale, the whole having a thickness of at least 8,000 or 10,000 feet,\r\nthough as both the base and the top of the series are marked by strong\r\nunconformabilities, the whole original thickness of deposits is nowhere\r\nseen. As these rocks are well developed around Loch Torridon, they\r\nwere named by Nicol the Torridon Sandstone--a designation which has\r\nmore recently been shortened into \"Torridonian.\" The lower system is\r\nmainly composed of various foliated rocks which may be embraced under\r\nthe general term \"gneiss.\" These masses present the usual characters of\r\nthe so-called \"fundamental complex\", \"Urgebirge,\" or \"Archæan Series\"\r\nof other countries. The contrast between the thoroughly crystalline,\r\ngnarled, ancient-looking gneisses below, and the overlying, nearly\r\nhorizontal Torridonian conglomerates, sandstones, and shales, which\r\nare largely made out of their debris, is so striking that every\r\nobserver feels persuaded that in any logical system of classification\r\nthey can not be both placed in the same division of the geological\r\nrecord. They are certainly both pre-Cambrian, but they must belong\r\nto widely separated eras, and must have been produced by entirely\r\ndifferent processes. If it is proposed to regard the gneisses as\r\n\"Archæan,\" we must refuse to include the Torridonian strata in the\r\nsame section of pre-Cambrian time. But so much uncertainty exists as\r\nto the application of this term Archæan, examples are so multiplying\r\nwherein what was supposed to be the oldest and truly Archæan rock is\r\nfound to be intrusive in rocks that were taken to be of much younger\r\ndate, and there are such slender grounds for correlating the so-called\r\nArchæan rocks of one country with those of another, that I prefer for\r\nthe present, at least, not to use the term at all. Let me very briefly\r\nstate some of the main characteristics of the two sharply contrasted\r\nrock-systems of the north-west of Scotland.\r\n\r\nThe oldest gneiss of that region was originally called \"Lewisian\" by\r\nMurchison, from its large development in the Island of Lewis, and I\r\nthink it would be, for the present at least, an advantage to retain\r\nthis geographical appellation. At first this \"fundamental gneiss\"\r\nwas thought to be a comparatively simple formation, and the general\r\nimpression probably was that it should be regarded as a metamorphic\r\nmass, produced mainly from the alterations of very ancient stratified\r\nrocks. Its foliation-planes were believed to be those of original\r\ndeposit which by terrestrial disturbance had been thrown into numerous\r\nplications and corrugated puckerings. But a detailed study of this\r\nprimeval rock has revealed in it a far more complicated structure. The\r\nsupposed bedding-planes have been ascertained to have nothing to do\r\nwith sedimentary stratification, and the gneiss has been resolved into\r\na complex series of eruptive rocks, varying from a highly basic to an\r\nacid type, and manifestly belonging to different times of extrusion.\r\nWith the exception of one district, to which I shall immediately refer,\r\nno part of the whole region yet examined has revealed to the rigid\r\nscrutiny of my colleagues of the Geological Survey, any trace of rocks\r\nwhich can be regarded as probably of other than igneous origin. It is\r\ntrue that our researches have been hitherto confined to the mainland\r\nof Scotland, the large area of the Outer Hebrides, which consists of\r\nsimilar gneisses, remaining to be explored. It is therefore possible\r\nthat indisputable evidence of an ancient sedimentary series through\r\nwhich the gneiss was originally protruded, may yet be discovered in\r\nthe unexplored islands. But taking the gneiss as at present known in\r\nSutherland and Rosshire, we find it to be generally coarse in texture,\r\nrudely foliated, and passing sometimes into massive types in which\r\nfoliation is either faintly developed or entirely absent. Much of this\r\ngneiss is considerably more basic than the more typical rocks to which\r\nthe term gneiss was formerly restricted. It consists of plagioclase\r\nfelspar with pyroxene, hornblende, and magnetite, sometimes with blue\r\nopalescent quartz, and sometimes with black mica. These predominant\r\nminerals are segregated in different proportions in the different\r\nbands, some bands consisting mainly of pyroxene or hornblende, with\r\nlittle or no plagioclase, others chiefly of plagioclase, with small\r\nquantities of the ferro-magnesian minerals and quartz, others of\r\nplagioclase and quartz, others of magnetite. This separation of mineral\r\nconstituents can hardly be attributed to mere mechanical deformation.\r\nIt rather resembles the segregation layers which may be studied in\r\nintrusive sills and other deep-seated masses of eruptive material, and\r\nwhich are obviously due to a process of separation that went on while\r\nthe igneous magma was still in a liquid or viscous condition. At the\r\nsame time it is manifest that extensive dynamical changes have affected\r\nthe rocks since the appearance of this original banded structure.\r\n\r\nThere is further evidence that beside the original eruptive masses,\r\nwhich for want of any means of discriminating their relative dates\r\nof protrusion must in the meantime be regarded as belonging to\r\none eruptive period, other portions of igneous material have been\r\nsubsequently and at successive epochs, after the first mechanical\r\ndeformations, injected into the body of the original gneiss. These\r\nconsist of dykes of basalt and dolerite, followed by still more basic\r\nperidotites and picrites, and lastly by emanations from a distinctly\r\nacid magma in the form of granites. The oldest or doleritic dykes form\r\na wonderful feature in the gneiss, from their abundance, persistence\r\nand uniformity of trend in a west-northwest direction. They have no\r\nparallel in British Geology until we reach the crowded dykes of older\r\nTertiary time.\r\n\r\nThroughout this remarkable complex of eruptive material, though its\r\ndifferent portions present many features that may be compared with\r\nthose of intrusive bosses and sheets belonging to later geological\r\nperiods, there is no trace of any superficial volcanic manifestation.\r\nNo tuffs or agglomerates or slaggy lavas have been detected, such\r\nas might serve to indicate the ejection of volcanic materials to\r\nthe surface. All the phenomena of the Lewisian gneiss point to the\r\nconsolidation of successively protruded portions of eruptive material\r\nat some depth within the crust.\r\n\r\nNevertheless it may yet be possible to show that these deep seated\r\nmasses have been injected into rocks of older date and of sedimentary\r\norigin, and that they have communicated with the surface in true\r\nvolcanic eruptions. I have already alluded to one limited area where\r\nvarious rocks exist, distinctly different from the prevalent types in\r\nthe Lewisian gneiss. In the area which is traversed by the long valley\r\nof Loch Maree in western Rosshire, there occur clay-slates, fine mica\r\nschists, graphitic schists, and saccharoid limestones. These rocks\r\nremind us of some of the prevalent members of a series of metamorphosed\r\nsediments. The minerals enclosed in the marbles are just such as might\r\nbe expected in the metamorphic aureole of a granite boss, piercing\r\nlimestone. But the relations of this group of rocks to the ordinary\r\ngneiss of the region are not quite so clear as could be desired, though\r\nthey seem to point to these rocks being surrounded by and enclosed\r\nwithin the gneiss.\r\n\r\nThe detailed field-work of the officers of the Geological Survey has\r\nmade known the remarkable amount of mechanical deformation which the\r\nvarious rock-masses composing the Lewisian gneiss have undergone.\r\nThese rocks have been compressed, crushed, and drawn out, until what\r\nwere originally massive crystalline protrusions have been converted\r\ninto perfect schists. The dykes of dolerite have been transformed\r\ninto hornblende-schists and the granitic pegmatites have been reduced\r\nto a kind of powder which has been rolled out so as to simulate the\r\nflow-structure of a lava. There is evidence that most, if not all, of\r\nthis dynamical change was effected long before the deposition of the\r\nTorridonian series, for the latter rests in nearly horizontal sheets,\r\nwith a strong unconformability upon the crushed and sheared gneiss.\r\n\r\n_Torridon Sandstone._ This group of rocks covers only a limited area\r\nin the north-west of Scotland, but it must once have spread over a\r\nfar more extensive region. It reaches a thickness, as I have said, of\r\n8,000 or 10,000 feet, and consists almost wholly of dull, purplish-red\r\nsandstones, often pebbly, and bands of conglomerate. Dark grey shales,\r\nalready alluded to as occurring towards the base of the series, are\r\nrepeated also in the highest visible portion, and have yielded tracks\r\nof what seem to have been annelids and casts of nail-like bodies which\r\nmay have been organic. I have said that the Torridonian deposits\r\nwhich were classed by Murchison as Cambrian, have been proved by the\r\ndiscovery of the _Olenellus_ zone in an unconformable position above\r\nthem, to be of pre-Cambrian age. Except along the line of disturbance\r\nto which I shall immediately refer, these strata are quite unaltered.\r\nIndeed, in general aspect they look as young as the old red sandstones\r\nwith which Hugh Miller identified them. It is at first hard to believe\r\nthat such flat undisturbed sandstones are of higher antiquity than\r\nthe very oldest Palæozoic strata which are so generally plicated and\r\ncleaved.\r\n\r\nThe interval of time between the deposition of the Torridon Sandstone\r\nand of the overlying Cambrian formations must have been of enormous\r\nduration, for the unconformability is so violent that the lowest\r\nCambrian strata, not only transgressively overspread all the\r\nTorridonian horizons, but even lie here and there directly on the\r\nold gneiss, the whole of the intervening thick mass of sandstone\r\nhaving been there removed by previous denudation. At Durness, in the\r\nnorth of Sutherland, about 2000 feet of Cambrian (possibly in part\r\nLower Silurian) strata can be traced, the lower portion consisting\r\nof quartzites, the central and upper parts of various limestones,\r\nsometimes abundantly fossiliferous. Nowhere else in the north of\r\nScotland can so thick a mass of early Palæozoic rocks be seen.\r\nElsewhere the limestones have been in large measure replaced by a\r\ncomplex group of schistose rocks which rest upon the Cambrian strata,\r\nand like them dip, generally at gentle angles, towards the east. It\r\nwas the opinion of Murchison, and was commonly admitted by geologists,\r\nthat these overlying schists represented a thick group of sediments,\r\nwhich, originally deposited continuously after the limestones, had\r\nbeen subsequently altered into their present condition by regional\r\nmetamorphism. They were variously named the \"Eastern schists,\" the\r\n\"younger gneiss,\" the \"gneissose and quartzose flagstones.\" Nicol,\r\nwho at first shared the general opinion regarding them, afterwards\r\nmaintained that they did not belong to a later formation than the\r\nlimestones, but were really only the old gneiss, brought up again from\r\nbeneath by enormous dislocations and over-thrusts. We now know from the\r\nlabors of Professor Lapworth and the officers of the Geological Survey,\r\nthat Murchison and Nicol had each seized on an essential part of the\r\nproblem, but that both of them had missed the true solution. Murchison\r\nwas in error in regarding his younger gneiss as a continuous sequence\r\nof altered sedimentary rocks conformably resting on the Cambrian (or\r\nto use his terminology, Lower-Silurian) formations. But he sagaciously\r\nobserved the coincidence of dip and strike between the schists and\r\nsedimentary rocks below them and inferred that this coincidence,\r\ntraceable for many leagues, proved that the metamorphism which had\r\ngiven these schists their structure must have taken place after the\r\ndeposition of the Durness limestones. Nicol, on the other hand, with\r\ngreat insight recognized that there was no continuous sequence above\r\nthose limestones, but that masses of the old gneiss had been thrust\r\nover them by gigantic faults. But he failed to see that no mere faults\r\nwould account for the coincidence between the structural lines just\r\nreferred to in the Cambrian strata, and in the overlying schists, and\r\nthat the general tectonic structures and lithological characters of the\r\neastern schists differed in many respects from those of the Lewisian\r\ngneiss.\r\n\r\nThe problems in tectonic geology presented by the complicated\r\nstructures of the northwest of Scotland have been ably worked out\r\nby the officers of the Geological Survey, to whose report in the\r\n_Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society_ for 1888, I would\r\nrefer for full details. It has been shown that, besides stupendous\r\ndislocations and horizontal displacements, the rocks have been cut into\r\ninnumerable slices which have been driven over each other from the\r\neastward, while at the same time there has been such a general shearing\r\nof the whole region that for many hundreds of square miles the original\r\nrock-structures have been entirely effaced, and have been replaced\r\nby new divisional planes, which, when they approach the underlying\r\nCambrian strata, are roughly parallel with the bedding planes of these\r\nstrata.\r\n\r\nIn this region, therefore, we have striking proofs of a stupendous\r\npost-Cambrian regional metamorphism. But there is still much\r\nuncertainty regarding the geological age of the rocks which have been\r\naffected by it. There can be no doubt that large masses of the old\r\ngneiss, torn up from below, have been thrust bodily westward for many\r\nmiles, and are now seen with their dykes and pegmatites resting on the\r\nDurness limestones and quartzites. It is equally certain that in other\r\ndistricts huge slices of the Torridon sandstones have been similarly\r\ntreated. But where all trace of original structure has disappeared, we\r\nhave, as yet, no means of definitely determining from what formation\r\nthe present eastern schists have been produced. The ordinary gneissose\r\nand quartzose flagstones do not appear to me to be such rocks as could\r\never be manufactured by any chemical or mechanical process out of the\r\naverage type of Lewisian gneiss. I have long held the belief that\r\nthey were originally sediments, but whether they represent altered\r\nTorridon Sandstone, or some clastic formations which may have followed\r\nthe Durness limestones, but which have been everywhere and entirely\r\nmetamorphosed, remains for future discovery. For my present purpose,\r\nit is sufficient to observe that, in the meantime, as we can not be\r\nsure of the origin of most of the rocks, which, between the West Coast\r\nand the line of the Great Glen, have been subjected to a gigantic\r\npost-Cambrian regional metamorphism, it seems safest to exclude them\r\nfrom an enumeration of the pre-Cambrian rocks of Britain.\r\n\r\n_Dalradian._ East of the line of Great Glen, which cuts the Scottish\r\nHighlands in two, another group of crystalline schistose rocks is\r\nlargely developed. It consists mainly of what were undoubtedly\r\noriginally sedimentary deposits, though they are now found in the form\r\nof quartzites, phyllites, graphitic schists, mica-schists, marbles,\r\nand various other foliated masses. With them are associated numerous\r\neruptive rocks, both acid and basic, sometimes still massive and\r\neasily recognizable as intrusive, sometimes more or less distinctly\r\nfoliated and passing into different gneisses, hornblende-schists,\r\nchloritic-schists, etc. Though it is not always possible in such a\r\nseries of metamorphic rocks to be certain of any real chronological\r\norder of succession, those of the Highland tracts have now been mapped\r\nin detail over so wide an area, that we are probably justified in\r\nbelieving that a definite sequence can be established among them.\r\nThese masses must be many thousand feet thick. Their succession and\r\nassociation of materials are so unlike those of any of the known older\r\nPalæozoic rocks of Britain, that they can hardly be the metamorphosed\r\nequivalents of any strata which can be recognized in an unaltered\r\ncondition in these islands. Some traces of annelid casts have been\r\nfound in the quartzites, but otherwise the whole series has remained\r\nentirely barren of organic remains.\r\n\r\nWhat then is the age of this important series? I must confess that in\r\nthe meantime I can give no satisfactory answer to this question. I\r\nhave proposed, for the sake of distinction and convenient reference,\r\nto call these rocks \"Dalradian.\" Murchison supposed them to be a\r\ncontinuation of his Durness quartzites, limestones, and \"younger\r\ngneiss.\" His belief may still prove to be in some measure well founded.\r\nBut at present we have no means of deciding whether the quartzites and\r\nlimestones of the Central Highlands are the more altered equivalents of\r\nthe undoubtedly Cambrian strata of the north-west. It is possible that\r\nin the vast mass of metamorphosed rocks constituting the wide stretch\r\nof country from the northern headlands of Aberdeen to the south-western\r\npromontories of Argyllshire, there may be portions of the old Lewisian\r\ngneiss, tracts of highly altered Torridon sandstone, belts of true\r\ncounterparts of the Cambrian quartzites and limestones of Durness,\r\nand, what should not be forgotten, considerable portions of some later\r\nsedimentary series which may have followed these limestones, but\r\nwhich, by the great dislocations already referred to, have disappeared\r\nfrom the north-west of Scotland. We are gradually learning more of\r\nthese rocks, as the detailed mapping of them by the Geological Survey\r\nadvances, and when the ground on either side of the Great Glen is\r\nsurveyed, it may be possible to speak with more certainty regarding\r\ntheir true geological relations.\r\n\r\nA glance at a geological map of the British Isles will show that the\r\nmetamorphic rocks of the south-western Highlands of Scotland are\r\nprolonged into the north of Ireland, where they spread over a region\r\nmany hundred square miles in extent. They retain there the same general\r\ncharacter and present the same difficult problems as to their true\r\nstratigraphical relations. Quite recently, however, a new light seems\r\nto have arisen upon these Irish rocks. My colleagues on the Irish\r\nBranch of the Geological Survey have detected several detached areas\r\nof coarse gneisses, which in many respects resemble parts of the\r\nLewisian gneiss of north-west Scotland. In some cases these areas lie\r\namidst or close to \"Dalradian\" rocks, but with that obstinacy, which\r\nso tries the patience of the field-geologist, they have persistently\r\nrefused to disclose their true original position with regard to these.\r\nSome fault, thrust-plane, tract of boulder-clay or stretch of bog\r\nis sure to intervene along the very junction-line where the desired\r\nsections might have been looked for. There can be little doubt that\r\na strong unconformability exists between them. A close examination of\r\nthe ridge of old gneiss in Tyrone and Fermanagh showed me that though\r\nthe actual basement-beds of this Dalradian series could not be seen\r\nresting on the coarse gneiss, the lithological character, and tectonic\r\narrangement of this series are only explicable on the supposition of a\r\ncomplete discordance between it and the gneiss. As these two groups of\r\nrock have never been found in close proximity in Scotland, and as the\r\ndetermination of the true age of the Dalradian series is a question of\r\nsuch great stratigraphical importance in the general mapping of the\r\nUnited Kingdom, I requested Mr. A. McHenry, of the Geological Survey of\r\nIreland, to continue the tracing of the mutual boundaries of the old\r\ngneiss of the Ox Mountains and the Dalradian series in County Mayo.\r\nHe informs me that he has found in that series a conglomerate full\r\nof blocks of the old gneiss, and resting in one locality apparently\r\nunconformably upon it. If this observation is confirmed it will finally\r\nset at rest the relative position of the coarse massive gneiss and\r\nsome portion, at least, of the Dalradian series. Of course there is\r\nno absolute proof that the coarse gneisses of Ireland are really the\r\nequivalents of the Lewisian masses which they so closely resemble. But\r\nthere is a strong presumption in favor of their identity.\r\n\r\nIn England and Wales many detached areas of rock have been claimed as\r\npre-Cambrian, and successive formations have been classified among\r\nthem. I have already dealt in part with this question, and without\r\nattempting here to review the voluminous literature of the subject, I\r\nwill content myself with stating briefly what seems to me to have been\r\nestablished on good evidence.\r\n\r\nThere can not, I think, be now any doubt that small tracts of gneiss,\r\nquite comparable in lithological character to portions of the Lewisian\r\nrocks of the north-west of Scotland, rise to the surface in a few\r\nplaces in England and Wales. In the heart of Anglesey, for example,\r\na tract of such rocks presents some striking external or scenic\r\nresemblance to the characteristic types of ground where the oldest\r\ngneiss forms the surface in Scotland and the west of Ireland. In the\r\nMalvern Hills another small knob of somewhat similar material is\r\nobviously far more ancient than the Cambrian rocks of that locality.\r\nThere may possibly be still some further exposures of similar rocks in\r\nthe south of England, as for instance in southern Cornwall. In Anglesey\r\na series of schists, quartzites and limestones has been included by\r\nMr. J. F. Blake with the coarse gneiss above referred to, and a thick\r\nhigher group of slates in what he terms the \"Monian\" system. These\r\nschists, quartzites and limestones present a close resemblance to the\r\nDalradian series of Scotland and Ireland, and the quartzites, like\r\nthose of the Highlands, contain worm-burrows. The coarse gneiss, as\r\nI have said, may be compared in general character with parts of the\r\nLewisian rocks, so that we seem to have here, as in Ireland, two groups\r\nof schistose rocks, and both of these must be much older than the\r\nunaltered Cambrian strata which lie above them.\r\n\r\nAlong the eastern borders of Wales, there is an interrupted ridge of\r\nigneous rocks which were originally supposed to have broken through the\r\nolder Palæozoic formations, but which now, owing mainly to the labors\r\nof Dr. Callaway and Professor Lapworth, are shown to be older than\r\nthe base of the Cambrian system. These rocks consist of spherulitic\r\nand perlitic felsites, with volcanic breccias and tuffs. They are\r\nundoubtedly older than the _Olenellus_ zone. Though the evidence is\r\nnot quite satisfactory, they may not impossibly lie at the base of\r\na vast mass of sedimentary rocks forming the ridge of the Longmynd.\r\nIn that case the whole of the Longmynd succession with the volcanic\r\ngroup at its base must be pre-Cambrian and lie unconformably below the\r\n_Olenellus_ zone. Dr. Callaway has proposed the name \"_Uriconian_\"\r\nfor this volcanic group, while the sedimentary series has been termed\r\n\"_Longmyndian_.\" On the supposition that the unconformability is\r\nestablished, there would here be a vast mass of stratified and partly\r\nerupted material forming a pre-Cambrian formation. Whether in that case\r\nany portion of this English series is the equivalent of the Torridonian\r\nrocks of Scotland remains to be determined. The northwestern part of\r\nthe Longmynd ridge is made of red sandstones and conglomerates, which\r\ncertainly resemble the Torridonian rocks of Ross and Sutherland.\r\n\r\nAt the base of the Cambrian rocks in Wales, Dr. Hicks has described a\r\nmarked volcanic series under the name of \"Pebidian,\" which he claims as\r\npre-Cambrian, alleging that it is separated from the Cambrian system\r\nby an unconformability, and a band of conglomerates. I have carefully\r\nstudied the evidence on this ground, and have come to the conclusion\r\nthat there is no unconformability at the line in question, but that the\r\nordinary Cambrian strata graduate downwards into the volcanic group\r\nand can not be disjoined from it. I therefore regard the so-called\r\n\"Pebidian\" as merely marking the duration of a volcanic period in early\r\nCambrian time.\r\n\r\nIt will thus be seen that according to my view the unmistakably\r\npre-Cambrian rocks of Britain consist of, first and oldest, the\r\nLewisian gneiss; second, the Torridonian sandstones and conglomerates.\r\nThe Uriconian and Longmyndian formations may prove to be in part or\r\nin whole equivalents of the Torridonian. The Dalradian rocks have not\r\nyet had their position determined. They may possibly mark a distinct\r\npre-Cambrian series, but it seems quite as probable that they are only\r\na metamorphic complex in which Archæan, Torridonian and Cambrian, or\r\neven Lower Silurian rocks are included.\r\n\r\n                                           =Sir Archibald Geikie=,\r\n  Director-General of the Geological Survey of Great Britain and Ireland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARE THERE TRACES OF GLACIAL MAN IN THE TRENTON GRAVELS?\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a paper published in _Science_, Nov. 25. 1892, I undertook to study\r\nthe evidence relating to paleolithic man in the eastern United States\r\nfrom a new point of view,--that furnished by certain recently acquired\r\nknowledge of the contents of quarries and shops where modern aboriginal\r\nflaked implements were made. It was shown that all rudely flaked forms\r\ncould be sufficiently accounted for without the necessity of assuming\r\na very rude state of culture, and that any people, paleolithic or\r\nneolithic, would in roughing out blades--the principal product of the\r\nflaking process--produce precisely these forms and in great numbers\r\nas refuse. It further appeared that the finding of these objects in\r\nsporadic cases in glacial gravels or in any formation whatsoever, could\r\nnot be considered as proving or tending to establish the existence of\r\na particular grade of stone-age culture for the region in which the\r\nformation occurs, since they may as readily pertain to a neolithic\r\nas to a paleolithic status. It was conclusively shown that no worked\r\nstone that can with reasonable safety be called an implement has been\r\nreported from the gravels, and that it is therefore clearly useless,\r\nnot to say unscientific, to go on enlarging upon the evidence of an\r\nAmerican paleolithic period and multiplying theoretic details of its\r\nculture.\r\n\r\nI now propose to review briefly the question of the age of our\r\nso-called paleolithic implements, the questions of the _grade_ of\r\na given feature of culture and of the _age_ or chronologic place\r\nof that culture being very properly treated separately, as they\r\ndepend for their support upon distinct classes of evidence. During\r\nthe past summer, 1892, certain important items of new evidence have\r\nbeen discovered bearing upon the question of the occurrence or\r\nnon-occurrence of rudely flaked stones or of any artificial objects\r\nwhatsoever in the normal gravels of the Delaware Valley, and it\r\ntherefore becomes necessary to examine somewhat critically such of the\r\npublished evidence as seems to be seriously affected by these recent\r\nobservations.\r\n\r\nIt may be stated in beginning that no one disputes the glacial age of\r\nthe Trenton gravels. The question to be discussed is simply this,--is\r\nthe evidence satisfactory that works of art have been found in these\r\ngravels? Nothing else need be asked or answered. I do not take up\r\nthis subject because I love controversy; disputation is really most\r\ndistasteful to me. It happens that under the Bureau of Ethnology of the\r\nSmithsonian Institution I have been assigned to the work of making a\r\nsurvey of the archeology of the Atlantic coast region in which large\r\nareas, especially in states south of Mason and Dixon's line, remained\r\nalmost untouched by investigators, and two years have been consumed\r\nmainly in these southern areas. But there are questions that refuse\r\nto be confined to definite geographic limits, and evidence secured in\r\none section is sometimes found to bear so directly and forcibly upon\r\nproblems pertaining primarily to other sections that the student of\r\nthese problems must perforce become a free lance, and unhesitatingly\r\nenter any province promising results of value, howsoever fully occupied\r\nit may be by other investigators. One of the most interesting and\r\nimportant questions growing out of the study of American archeology\r\nhas, as we have seen, arisen in the Delaware Valley, and the turn taken\r\nby some of my work in the south and west is such that I cannot pass\r\nthis question by without consideration. The necessity of taking up\r\nthe subject of glacial man became more and more apparent as the years\r\npassed on, and people continued to say to me, \"You must go to Trenton;\r\nwe are not satisfied with the present status of the question there; the\r\nevidence arrayed in favor of the theory of a paleolithic gravel man\r\nneeds critical examination.\"\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of taking up and re-examining evidence, of which the\r\nrecord only remains, is, however, very great, since in most cases\r\nthe evidence rests upon or consists of field observations, and these\r\ncannot be recalled or repeated, and there is absolutely no means of\r\ntesting directly the value of what is recorded. One may seek either to\r\nverify or to discredit the promulgated theories, but years of search\r\nmay fail to produce a single new item of evidence bearing decisively\r\nupon the subject. It is possible that at one period numerous finds of\r\nimplements should be reported from certain portions of the gravels,\r\nand that afterwards the whole remaining body of these formations\r\nshould be worked over and searched without securing a trace of art;\r\nyet this latter evidence, being negative, need not necessarily be\r\nconsidered sufficient to overturn the original positive evidence if\r\nthat happens to be of a high class. There is not the least doubt,\r\nhowever, that positive evidence may be so impaired by various defects\r\nand inconsistencies, that, unsupported by renewed and well verified\r\nobservations, it will finally yield to the negative forces; and if\r\nthe theories of a gravel man in the eastern United States, howsoever\r\nfortified by accumulated observations, are not really properly\r\nsupported in every way, they are bound in time to fall to the ground.\r\nAll I can reasonably hope to do now is to have the evidence relating to\r\nglacial man placed on trial, and so fully examined and cross-examined\r\nthat those who accept gravel man need not longer do so blindly without\r\nknowing that there are two sides to the question, and those who do not\r\naccept him may know something of the reasons for the belief that is in\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe evidence employed to prove the presence of a race of men in\r\nthe Delaware Valley in glacial times is confined almost wholly to\r\nthe alleged discovery of rude implements in the glacial gravels.\r\nPractically all the evidence has been collected by Dr. C. C. Abbott,\r\nand upon his skill as an observer, his faithfulness as a recorder,\r\nhis correctness of judgment and his integrity of character, the whole\r\nmatter stands. Many visitors, men of high repute in archeology and\r\ngeology, have visited the site, but the observations made on such\r\noccasions appear not to have been of a nature to be of great value in\r\nevidence, the finds being doubtful works of art or not having properly\r\nestablished relationships with the gravels in place. In the discussion\r\nof gravel man in eastern America a wide range of objects and phenomena\r\nhas been considered, but the real evidence, upon which the theory of\r\nan ancient race and a peculiar culture must depend, is furnished by a\r\nhundred pieces--more or less--of rudely flaked stones said to have come\r\nfrom the gravels in place. And now what can be said with reference to\r\nthis series of flaked stones further than that they are reported by the\r\ncollector to have been found in the gravels at definite stated depths?\r\nI have elsewhere shown that they are not demonstrably implements\r\nin any case, that they are identical in every respect with the\r\nquarry-shop rejects of the American Indian, that they do not closely\r\nresemble any one of the well established types of European paleolithic\r\nimplements, and that they are not a sufficient index of a particular\r\nstage of culture. I shall now present such reasons as there may be\r\nfor the belief, held by many, that they were not really found in the\r\nundisturbed glacial gravels.\r\n\r\nIt is generally understood that the earliest reported gravel finds of\r\nimportance were made on the banks of Assanpink creek within the city\r\nlimits of Trenton, where the gravels to a thickness of twenty feet or\r\nmore were exposed in a railway cutting. Later the river bluff near the\r\nlower end of the city, where the gravels were exposed to a depth of\r\nfrom twenty-five to forty feet, yielded large numbers. These two sites,\r\nso far as I can learn, furnished at least three-fourths of the finds in\r\nplace. Other specimens were found singly in slight natural exposures,\r\nand in excavations for cellars, sewers, etc., at various points within\r\nthe city limits.\r\n\r\nThe river bluff was for a considerable period the favorite hunting\r\nground of the searchers for rudely flaked stones, and many specimens\r\nwere collected. The gravels were exposed in a steep, nearly straight\r\nbank, several hundred yards in length, the base of which was washed by\r\nthe river. There can be no question that Dr. Abbott and others have\r\nfound shaped objects of various classes upon and in the face of this\r\nriver bluff, and the visitor to-day, although the bluff is now buried\r\nalmost completely under city refuse, will hardly fail to find some\r\nrudely flaked form in the deeper gullies or upon the narrow river bank\r\nor beach at the base. Dr. Abbott explicitly states[1] that he obtained\r\ncertain of these specimens from the gravel outcrops, and that they were\r\nnot in talus formations, but in undisturbed deposits. How then is it\r\npossible to do otherwise than accept these statements as satisfactory\r\nand final?\r\n\r\n[1] Abbott, C. C. Primitive Industry, pp. 493-510.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =Fig. 1.= Sketch map of the Trenton bluff, showing the\r\nrelation of the sewer trench to the \"implement\" yielding slope.... a-b\r\nsection line, =Fig. 2=.]\r\n\r\nVery recently, however, fortunate circumstances have brought the\r\nevidence furnished by this site again within our reach, thus enabling\r\nus to re-open the discussion under favorable conditions. What I had\r\nfor some time desired to do in this case was, what I had already done\r\nat Piny Branch, D. C., and at Little Falls, Minn., to open a trench\r\ninto the face of the bluff, and thus secure evidence for or against\r\nthe theory of a gravel man. This measure was, however, rendered\r\nimpracticable by the occupation of the bluff margin by a city street;\r\nbut it happened last summer that the city authorities, desiring to\r\nimprove the sanitary condition of the city, decided to open a great\r\nsewer through this very bluff to get a lower outlet to the river. A\r\ntrench twelve feet wide and some thirty feet deep, the full depth\r\nof the exposed gravels, was carried along the bluff just inside of\r\nits margin, opening out into the river at the point where the bluff\r\nturns toward the north-east. It was a trenching more complete and more\r\nsatisfactory than any of which I had ever dreamed. At no point for the\r\nentire length of the bluff did the excavation depart more than forty\r\nfeet from the line of the terrace face--from the upper margin of the\r\nslope upon which such plentiful evidence of a supposed gravel man had\r\nbeen obtained. The accompanying map and section, Figs. 1 and 2, will\r\nindicate the location of the trench, and show the exact relations of\r\nthe natural and artificial exposures of the gravels.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =Fig. 2.= Sections made by the river and by the sewer,\r\nthe former yielding many \"implements,\" the latter yielding none.]\r\n\r\nI made several visits to the place, descended frequently into the great\r\ncut and examined the gravels and their contents with the utmost care,\r\nbut without securing a trace of art. Recognizing the vital importance\r\nof utilizing to the fullest extent this opportunity of testing the\r\nart-bearing nature of the gravels at this point, I resolved to\r\nundertake a systematic study of the subject. Summoning my assistant,\r\nMr. William Dinwiddie, from his field of operations in the South, I had\r\nhim spend upwards of a month at the great trench, faithfully watching\r\nthe gravels as they were exposed. Mr. Dinwiddie had worked three years\r\nunder my personal direction, and had helped open upwards of twenty\r\ntrenches through similar gravel deposits, and was therefore well\r\nqualified for the work. Prof. W. J. McGee, Prof. R. D. Salisbury, Dr.\r\nStewart Culin and Dr. Abbott also visited the place one or more times\r\neach. Relics of art were found upon the surface and in such portions of\r\nthe talus as happened to be exposed, but nothing whatever was found in\r\nthe gravels in place, and the search was closed when it became fully\r\napparent that the case was hopeless.\r\n\r\nIt may be claimed that the conditions under which gravels are exposed\r\nin trenching as it progresses, are not as favorable for the collection\r\nof enclosed relics as where exposed by natural processes of weathering.\r\nThis is true in a certain measure, as specimens may be obscured by\r\nthe damp clinging sand which forms the matrix of the gravels. This,\r\nhowever, would interfere but little with the discovery of large flaked\r\nstones, such as we were led to expect in this place, and this slight\r\ndisadvantage in detecting shaped pieces in fresh exposures is more\r\nthan over-balanced by the treachery of weathered surfaces which often\r\ngive to intrusive objects the appearance of original inclusion. The\r\nopportunity for studying the gravels in all their phases of bedding,\r\ncomposition and contents, was really excellent, and no one could watch\r\nthe constantly renewed exposures hour after hour for a month without\r\nforming a most decided notion as to the implement bearing qualities\r\nof the formation. Not the trace of a flaked stone, or of a flake or\r\nartificial fragment of any kind was found, and we closed the work\r\nwith the firm conviction that the gravels exposed by this trench were\r\nabsolutely barren of art. But Dr. Abbott claims to have found numerous\r\nimplements in the bluff face a few feet away and in the same gravels.\r\nIf this is true, the conditions of glacial occupation of this site\r\nmust have been indeed remarkable. It is implied that during the whole\r\nperiod occupied by the melting of the ice sheet within the drainage of\r\nthe Delaware valley the hypothetical rude race lived on a particular\r\nline or zone afterwards exposed by the river to the depth of 30 feet,\r\nleaving his strange \"tools\" there by the hundreds, while another line\r\nor zone, not more than forty feet away at most, exposed to the same\r\ndepth by an artificial trench, was so avoided by him that it does not\r\nfurnish the least memento of his presence. One vertical slice of the\r\ngravels twelve feet thick does not yield even a broken stone, while\r\nanother slice not probably one-half as thick, cut obliquely through\r\nthe gravels near by, has furnished subject-matter for numerous books\r\nand substantiation for a brace of theories. That no natural line of\r\ndemarcation between the two section lines is possible, is shown by\r\nthe fact that the formations are continuous, and that the deposits\r\nindicate a constant shifting of lines and areas of accumulation;\r\nthus it was impossible for any race to dwell continuously upon any\r\nspot, line or plane. This is well shown in the section, Fig. 3, which\r\ngives the relations of the art-producing section of Dr. Abbott to the\r\nnon-art-producing section of the sewer. The gravels were laid down\r\nentirely irrespective of subsequent cutting, natural or artificial;\r\nyet we are expected to believe that a so-called gravel man could have\r\nresorted for a thousand years to the space _a_, leaving his half\r\nshaped or incipient tools at all stages of the gravel building from\r\nbase to top, failing entirely to visit a neighboring space _b_, or to\r\nleave there a single flake to reward the most faithful search. It is\r\nmuch easier to believe that one man should err than that a guileless\r\nrace should thus conspire with a heartless nature to accomplish such\r\nextraordinary results. The easier explanation of the whole matter is\r\nthat the objects found by Dr. Abbott were not really in the gravels,\r\nbut that they are Indian shop-refuse settled into the old talus\r\ndeposits of the bluff, and that his eager eyes, blinded by a prevailing\r\nbelief in a paleolithic man for all the world alike, failed to observe\r\nwith their wonted keenness and power.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =Fig. 3.= _a_, Reputed \"implement\" producing zone of the\r\nriver front. _b_, Barren zone of sewer.]\r\n\r\nBut this case does not stand alone. The first discoveries of supposed\r\ngravel implements are said to have been made when the Pennsylvania\r\nRailway opened a road bed through the creek terrace on the site of the\r\npresent station. At first numerous specimens of rudely flaked stones\r\nwere reported, and the locality became widely known to archeologists,\r\nbut the implement bearing portions of the gravels--and this is a most\r\nsignificant fact--were limited in extent, and the deposit was soon\r\ncompletely removed, the horizontal extension containing nothing. At\r\npresent there are excellent exposures of the full thickness of the\r\ngravels at this point, but the most diligent search is vain, the only\r\nresult of days of examination being a deep conviction that these\r\ngravels are and always were wholly barren of art.\r\n\r\nIt thus appears that here as well as upon the river front, the works\r\nof art were confined to local deposits, limited horizontally but not\r\nvertically, and a strong presumption is created that the finds were\r\nconfined to redistributed gravels settled upon the terrace face in the\r\nform of talus. Dr. Abbott states that \"at that point where I gathered\r\nthe majority of specimens there is a want of stratification.\"[2] It\r\nis well known that such rearranged deposits are often difficult to\r\ndistinguish from the original gravels. In trenching an implement\r\nproducing terrace at Washington--where the conditions were probably\r\nquite similar to those at the Trenton railroad station--I passed\r\nthrough eighty feet of redistributed talus gravels before encountering\r\nthe gravels in place, and so deceptively were portions of these\r\ndeposits re-set that experts in gravel phenomena were unable to decide\r\nwhether they were or were not portions of the original formation\r\n(cretaceous). The question was finally settled by the discovery of\r\nartificially shaped stones in and beneath the deposits.\r\n\r\n[2] Abbott, C. C. 10th Annual Report of the Peabody Museum, p. 41.\r\n\r\nAgain, an implement bearing deposit of gravel was recently discovered\r\nby the late Miss F. E. Babbitt at Little Falls, Minnesota, and\r\nsufficient (a very little) digging was done to satisfy the discoverer,\r\nand all paleolithic archeologists as well, that the objects were really\r\nimbedded in the glacial gravels. In the summer of 1892 I visited the\r\nplace and carried a trench twenty feet horizontally into the terrace\r\nface on the \"implement bed\" level before encountering the gravels in\r\nplace. The talus deposits were several feet thick, and were of such\r\na nature that their true character could not be determined without\r\ncareful and extensive trenching. The whole talus deposit was here\r\nwell stocked with Indian quartz quarry-shop rejects, which were as\r\nusual of paleolithic types, and it was but natural that Miss Babbitt's\r\nconclusions, although based as they necessarily were upon inexpert\r\nobservations, backed by such well known \"types\" of \"implements\" should\r\nbe unhesitatingly accepted by believers.\r\n\r\nThe occurrence of these telling examples of the deceptive appearance\r\nof re-set gravels would seem to justify and emphasize the conviction\r\ncreated by a critical examination of the two leading so-called\r\npaleolithic sites at Trenton, that Dr. Abbott, notwithstanding his\r\nasseverations to the contrary, has been deceived. Very strong support,\r\nit seems to me, is given to this conclusion by the recently published\r\nopinion of the late Dr. H. Carvill Lewis, a glacialist familiar\r\nwith the Trenton region, and with the work of Dr. Abbott at the\r\nperiod of his paleolithic castle building. Dr. Lewis is reported to\r\nhave maintained before an open meeting of the Academy of Science in\r\nPhiladelphia \"that what Dr. Abbott believed to be undisturbed layers\r\n(of gravel) were those of an ancient talus.\"[3] This remark may refer\r\nto both the main sites--the one at the railroad station and the other\r\nat the river front--or possibly only to the former. I have also heard\r\nit stated that that eminent scholar, Dr. Leidy, who must have had ample\r\nopportunities of forming correct opinions upon the subject, held pretty\r\nmuch the same views of Dr. Abbott's finds.\r\n\r\n[3] Brinton, D. G., Science, Oct. 28, p. 249.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =Fig. 4.= A freshly formed gravel bluff.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =Fig. 5.= Early stage of talus formation.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =Fig. 6.= An ancient talus.]\r\n\r\nTo make the above criticism entirely clear, a few words of explanation\r\nof talus phenomena may be added. As a river cuts its channel deeper\r\nand deeper into deposits of gravel a section is gradually exposed, but\r\nthe gravels break down readily under atmospheric influences and the\r\nexposed face does not retain a high angle. The upper part crumbles and\r\ndescends toward the base, there to rest against the slope or to be\r\ncarried away by the stream. A supposititious case will be convenient\r\nfor illustration. A gravel terrace twenty feet in height is encroached\r\nupon by the river at high water and undermined, and the face breaks\r\ndown vertically, leaving an exposure as illustrated in Fig. 4. In a\r\nvery short time the upper portions become loosened and fall below,\r\ngiving a steep slope as seen in Fig. 5. The process goes on with\r\ngradually decreasing rapidity, and if the river does not again encroach\r\nseriously, a practically stable slope is reached, as shown in Fig.\r\n6. Such a talus may be hundreds or even thousands of years old, but\r\nthere is rarely any means of determining its exact age. If the gravels\r\nare homogeneous in character, the talus will simulate their normal\r\ncondition so completely that the distinction cannot be made out in\r\nordinary gullies or by unsystematic digging. If the gravels contain\r\nvaried strata the talus will be composite, and will be more readily\r\ndistinguished from at least portions of the material in place.\r\n\r\nNow it is important to observe what may be the possible art contents\r\nof such a talus as that shown in Fig. 6. It may contain all objects\r\nof art originally included in that portion of the gravels represented\r\nby _a_, _b_, _c_, together with all articles that happened to be upon\r\nthe surface _b_, _c_, beside such objects as may have accumulated from\r\ndwelling or shop work upon its own surface, after the slope became\r\nsufficiently reduced to be occupied for these purposes. A talus is\r\ntherefore liable to contain, and in the utmost confusion, relics of all\r\nperiods of occupation, supposing always that there were such periods,\r\nfrom the beginning of the formation of the gravel deposits down to the\r\npresent moment. As a rule such a talus, if art-containing, will have a\r\nlarge percentage of shop and quarry-shop refuse, for the reason that\r\nthe exposed gravels, and the banks and beds of rivers cutting them,\r\nfurnish, as a rule, a good deal of the raw material utilized by workers\r\nin stone, and the shops in which the work was done are usually located\r\nupon the slopes and outer margins of the terraces. Although there is\r\nthe possibility of very considerable age for these talus deposits,\r\nit is unlikely that any of them date back as far as the close of the\r\nglacial epoch or at all near it, for rivers change back and forth\r\nconstantly, undermining first one bank and then the other, so that a\r\nvery large percentage of our talus deposits have been formed well\r\nwithin the historic period.\r\n\r\nAt Trenton the constantly exposed gravel banks afforded considerable\r\nargillite in bowlders, fragments and heavy masses, as well as some\r\nother flakable stones of inferior quality little used, and it is\r\ninevitable that the Indian who dwelt upon the shores of the river\r\nshould have sought the workable pieces along the bluff, leaving the\r\nrefuse everywhere; and it is a necessary consequence that the terrace\r\nmargin, the bluff face, and the talus deposits, places little fitted\r\nfor habitation, should for long distances contain no trace of any\r\nart shapes save such as pertain to manufacture. Thus are fully and\r\nsatisfactorily accounted for all the turtle backs and other rude\r\nforms that our paleolith hunters have been so assiduously gathering.\r\nNothing can be more fully apparent than that no other race than the\r\nIndian in his historic character and condition need be conjured up to\r\nreasonably account for every phase and every article of the recovered\r\nart. Mistaken interpretations of the nature of shop rejects, and the\r\ncommon association of these objects with redistributed gravels, are\r\nprobably accountable for the many misconceptions that have arisen.\r\nTalus deposits form exceedingly treacherous records for the would-be\r\nchronologist. They are the reef upon which more than one paleolithic\r\nadventurer has been wrecked.\r\n\r\nRelics of art attributed to gravel man have been collected, so far\r\nas I can gather from museum labels and from incidental references in\r\nvarious publications, from a number of sites aside from the two already\r\nreferred to. These are scattered over the city, and the finds were made\r\nmostly in exposures of the gravels that remained visible for a short\r\ntime only, as in street and cellar excavations and well pits. These\r\nreported finds can never be brought within the range of re-examination,\r\nand the searcher after unimpeachable testimony must content himself\r\nwith placing them in the doubtful column on general principles.\r\nUrban districts are so subject to disturbance through cutting down\r\nof hills, filling in of depressions, grading of streets, digging of\r\nfoundations, cellars, sewers, wells and graves that no man can, from a\r\nlimited exposure such as those producing the reported tools necessarily\r\nwere, speak with certainty of the undisturbed nature of the deposits\r\npenetrated. It is doubtful if any one is justified in publishing such\r\nobservations at all without serious query. Such testimony is liable\r\nto fall of its own inherent weakness, being absolutely valueless if\r\nunsupported by collateral evidence of real weight. It can only be made\r\npermanently available to science by the discovery of something unusual\r\nor unique with which to couple it, something decidedly un-Indian in\r\ncharacter or type, as for example the two skulls now in the Peabody\r\nMuseum. These objects and the antler knife-handle exhibited with them\r\nmay be alluded to as the only finds so far made at Trenton, having\r\nof themselves the least potentiality as proof and these skulls and\r\nthis knife-handle must yet be subjected to the rigid examination made\r\nnecessary by the importance of the conclusions to be based upon them.\r\n\r\nSomething may now be said concerning the art remains upon which\r\nthis discussion hinges, and upon which conclusions of the greatest\r\nimportance to anthropology are supposed to depend. Let us pass over\r\nall that has been said with regard to their manner of occurrence and\r\nassociation with the gravels and ask them simply what story they tell\r\nof themselves. Does this story, so far as we are able clearly to read\r\nit, speak of a great antiquity and a peculiar culture, or does it hint\r\nrather at vital weaknesses in the position taken by the advocates of\r\nthese ideas? We shall see. The history of the utilization of rudely\r\nflaked stones in the attempt to establish a gravel man in America\r\nhas never been written, but as read between the lines of paleolithic\r\nliterature, it runs about as follows: The theory of a very rude and\r\nancient people, having a unique culture and certain peculiar art\r\nlimitations, was developed in Europe many years ago in a manner well\r\nknown and often rehearsed. This people was associated with the ice age\r\nin Europe, and this epoch, with its moraines and till and sedimented\r\ngravels, was found to have been repeated in America. It was the most\r\nnatural thing possible that these discoveries should carry with them\r\nthe suggestion that man may have existed here as in Europe during that\r\nepoch, and that his culture was of closely corresponding grade. These\r\nwere legitimate inferences and warranted the instituting of careful\r\nresearches, but it was a dangerous suggestion to put into the minds of\r\nenthusiastic novices with fertile brains and ready pens. The idea was\r\nhardly transplanted to American soil before finds began to be made. The\r\nso-called \"types\" of European paleoliths suggested the lines upon which\r\nfinds here should be made, and everything in the way of flaked stones\r\nconnected directly or indirectly with the glacial gravels which had not\r\nyet been fully credited to and absorbed by the inconvenient Indian, was\r\nseized upon as representing the ancient time and its hypothetic people\r\nand culture. In the early days of the investigation the various rude\r\nforms of flaked stones, resulting from failures in manufacture, had not\r\nbeen studied, and were shrouded in convenient mystery, and they thus\r\nbecame the foundation of the new archeologic dynasty in America, the\r\ndynasty of the turtle-back. Dr. Abbott states in his first work[4] that\r\nthese rude \"implements\" are not especially characteristic of any one\r\nlocality, but seem to be scattered uniformly over the state. Specimens\r\nof every type, he says, are \"found upon the surface, and are plowed\r\nup every spring and autumn; but this in no way militates against the\r\nopinion that these ruder forms are far older than the well-chipped\r\njasper and beautifully-polished porphyry stone-work.\"[5] At that stage\r\nof the investigation it was not at all necessary that a specimen should\r\ncome from the gravels in place or from any given depth, since the\r\n\"type\" was supposed to be easily recognized and was a sufficient means\r\nof settling the question of age.\r\n\r\n[4] Abbott, C. C. The Stone Age in N. J., Sm. Rep. 1875, p. 247.\r\n\r\n[5] Ibid, p. 252.\r\n\r\nRude \"implements\" were called for and they were found. The only\r\nrequirements were that they should not be of well-known Indian types,\r\nthat they should be rude and have some sort of resemblance to what\r\nwere known as paleolithic implements abroad. Since most of these\r\nso-called gravel implements of Europe are also doubtless the rejects\r\nof manufacture resemblances were readily found. The early attempts\r\nto utilize these rejects in support of the theory, and make them\r\nmasquerade creditably as \"implements\" with specialized features and\r\nself-evident adaptation to definite ice-age uses, now appear decidedly\r\namusing. Gradually, however, the lines have been drawn upon this early\r\nlicense, and it is to-day well understood by all careful students, that\r\nsince the rude forms are so often repeated in modern neolithic refuse,\r\nthe only reliable test of a gravel \"implement\" is its occurrence in\r\nthe gravels in place. That a particular \"implement,\" said to have been\r\nobtained from the gravels, is of \"paleolithic type,\" does not in the\r\nleast strengthen its claims to being a _bona fide_ gravel implement;\r\nnor does its easy assignment to a \"type\" give any additional value to\r\nthe collector's claim that the gravels said to contain it are implement\r\nbearing. The very names, \"rude implement,\" \"paleolithic implement,\"\r\netc., carry with them a certain amount of mysterious suggestion; one\r\nthinks of unique, significant shapes and of strange, archaic uses.\r\nAt their mere mention, the great ice sheet looms up with startling\r\nrealism, and the reindeer and the mighty mammoth appear upon the\r\nscene. The reader of our paleolithic literature is led to feel that\r\nthese antiquated objects carry volumes of history in their worn and\r\nweather-beaten faces, but this is all the figment of fertile brains.\r\nThese objects have without exception the appearance of the most\r\ncommonplace every-day rejects of manufacture without specialization and\r\nwithout hidden meaning. They tell of themselves no story whatsoever,\r\nsave that of the oft-repeated failure of the aboriginal blade maker in\r\nhis struggle with refractory stones. This will be shown with greater\r\nclearness farther on.\r\n\r\nBut the scheme does not end with the repetition of a European state of\r\naffairs. Our gravel archeologists have not been content to adopt that\r\nfeature of the foreign scheme which utterly destroys the paleolithic\r\nrace before a higher culture is brought upon the scene. It was\r\nthought to improve upon the borrowed plan by allowing for a gradual\r\ndevelopment upward from the paleolithic stage, represented exclusively\r\nby a class of meaningless bits of flaked stone, through a period less\r\nrude, characterized by productions so far advanced as to be assigned\r\nto a definite use. These latter productions consist mainly of rather\r\nlarge and often rude blades, sometimes plain, but generally notched or\r\nmodified at the broader end as if to be set in a handle, or attached to\r\na spear or arrow shaft. These were assigned to post-glacial times in\r\nsuch a way as to bridge or partly bridge the great space between the\r\nglacial epoch and the present. They were separated arbitrarily from the\r\nbody of the collections of the region, and referred to as probably the\r\nwork of an Eskimo race. This arrangement produced a pleasing symmetry\r\nand completeness, and brought the history of man down to the beginning\r\nof the Indian epoch, which is represented by all of those forms of art\r\nwith which the red man is historically associated.\r\n\r\nThree principal periods are thus thought to be represented by the\r\nfinds at Trenton; and in the arrangement of the collections these\r\ngrand divisions are illustrated by three great groups of relics, which\r\nare looked upon by the founders of the scheme as an epitome of native\r\nAmerican art and culture. By others this grouping is looked upon as\r\npurely empirical, as an arbitrary separation of the normal art remains\r\nof the historic Indian, not suggested by anything in the nature or\r\ncondition of the objects, nor in the manner of their discovery.\r\n\r\nThe \"Eskimo\" feature of the scheme requires a more detailed examination\r\nthan can be given it here. It may be stated, however, that the\r\nseparation of the so-called Eskimo spear points, or whatever they\r\nmay be, from the great body of associated articles of flaked stone,\r\nappears to be a highly arbitrary proceeding. That they were extensively\r\nmade by the Indians is proved by the occurrence of refuse resulting\r\nfrom their manufacture on modern shop sites, and that they were used\r\nby the Indian, is equally apparent from their common occurrence on\r\nmodern dwelling sites. The exceptionally large size of the argellite\r\npoints is readily accounted for by the nature of the material. It was\r\nthe only stone of the region well adapted to the manufacture of long\r\nblades or projectile points. Jasper, quartz and flint have such minute\r\ncleavage that, save in rare cases, small implements only could be\r\nmade from them. Their peculiar manner of occurrence, described at so\r\nmuch length by Dr. Abbott,[6] has been given undue consideration and\r\nweight. The phenomena observed may all be accounted for as a result of\r\nthe vicissitudes of aboriginal life and occupation within the last few\r\nhundred years as fully and satisfactorily as by jumping thousands of\r\nyears backward into the unknown.\r\n\r\n[6] Abbott, C. C. Popular Science Monthly, Dec., 1889.\r\n\r\nWhatsoever real support there may be for the \"Eskimo\" theory, either in\r\nthe published or the unpublished evidence, it is apparent that under\r\nthe present system of solitary and inexpert research, the scientific\r\nworld will gain little that it can utilize without distrust and danger.\r\nWhatsoever may be the final outcome--which outcome is bound to be the\r\ntruth--it is clear that there is little in the present evidence to\r\nwarrant the separation of a \"paleolithic\" and an \"Eskimo\" period of art\r\nfrom that of the Indian.\r\n\r\nThat the art remains of the Trenton region are essentially a unit,\r\nhaving no natural separation into time, culture or stock groups,\r\nis easily susceptible of demonstration. I have already presented\r\nstrong reasons for concluding that all the finds upon the Trenton\r\nsites are from the surface or from recent deposits, and that all may\r\nreasonably be assigned to the Indian. A find has recently been made\r\nwhich furnishes full and decisive evidence upon this point. At Point\r\nPleasant, on the Delaware, some twenty-five miles above Trenton, there\r\nare outcrops of argillite, and here have been discovered recently the\r\nshop sites upon which this stone was worked. There are two features\r\nof these shops to which the closest attention must be given. The\r\nfirst is that they are manifestly modern; they are situated on the\r\npresent flood plain of the Delaware, and but a few feet above average\r\nwater level, the glacial terrace here being some forty or fifty feet\r\nin height. These shops, therefore, represent the most modern phases\r\nof aboriginal industry, and may have been occupied at the coming of\r\nWilliam Penn. The second point is that every type of flaked argillite\r\nfound in the Trenton region, associated with the gravels or otherwise,\r\nis found on this site. It was to a certain extent a quarry site, for\r\nthe great masses of argillite brought down by the floods were here\r\nbroken up and removed from the river banks or bed. It was a shop site,\r\nfor here the articles, mainly blades, were roughed out, and it was\r\nalso a dwelling place--a village site--where all the specialized forms\r\nof flaked stones made from the blades were prepared for use. Here are\r\nfound great numbers of the rude failures, duplicating every feature\r\nof the mysterious \"paleolith\" with which our museums are stocked,\r\nand exhibiting the same masterly quitting at just the point \"where\r\nno further shaping was possible.\"[7] Here we see the same boldly\r\nmanipulated \"cutting edge,\" the \"flat bottom\" and \"high peak,\" and the\r\nsame mysteriously weathered and disintegrated surfaces, so skillfully\r\nmade, by a nice balancing of accidents,[8] to tell the story of\r\nchronologic sequence in deposition.\r\n\r\n[7] Abbott, C. C. Smithsonian Report, 1875, p. 248.\r\n\r\n[8] Ibid. Primitive Industry, p. 487.\r\n\r\nBeside the failures, we have here, as on other quarry shop sites, the\r\nevidence of more advanced work, the wide, thick, defective blades, and\r\nmany of the long, thin blades broken at or near the finishing point.\r\nHere, too, just back of the roughing-out shops, are the dwelling sites\r\nfrom which many specialized forms are obtained. The \"Eskimo\" type\r\nis fully represented as well as the ordinary spear point, the arrow\r\npoint, and the perforator of our Indian. There is not a type of flaked\r\nargillite known in the Delaware valley that may not be duplicated\r\nhere on this modern Indian site, and this has been known by local\r\narcheologists for years. Why so little has been said about the matter\r\nis thus explained. Dr. Abbott, in 1890, discovering this site, and\r\nfinding \"typical paleolithic implements\" (the ordinary ruder forms of\r\nrejects) among the refuse, was so entirely at a loss to explain the\r\noccurrence that he felt compelled to again \"take up the examination\r\nof the gravel deposits of the valley of the Delaware\" with the hope\r\nof \"finally solving the problem.\"[9] The true conditions would have\r\nbeen at once apparent to any one not utterly blinded by the prevailing\r\nmisconceptions.\r\n\r\n[9] Abbott, C. C. Annual Report of the Curator of the Museum of\r\nAmerican Archeology, University of Pennsylvania. No. 1, p. 7.\r\n\r\nThe entire simplicity of the archeologic conditions in the Delaware\r\nvalley may be further illustrated. Had William Penn paused in his\r\narduous traffic with the tawny Delawares, and glanced out with\r\nfar-sighted eyes from beneath the pendant branches of the great elm\r\nat Shackamaxon, he might have beheld an uncouth savage laboriously\r\nfabricating rude ice age tools, making the clumsy turtle-back, shaping\r\nthe mysterious paleolith, thus taking that first and most interesting\r\ntheoretical step in human art and history. Had he looked again a few\r\nmoments later he might have beheld the same tawny individual deeply\r\nabsorbed in the task of trimming a long rude spear point of \"Eskimo\"\r\ntype from the refractory argillite. If he had again paused when another\r\nhandful of baubles had been judiciously exchanged, he would have seen\r\nthe familiar redskin carefully finishing his arrow points and fitting\r\nthem to their shafts preparatory to a hunting and fishing cruise on the\r\nplacid Delaware. Thus in a brief space of time Penn might have gleaned\r\nthe story of the ages--the history of the turtle-back, the long spear\r\npoint and their allies--as in a single sheaf. But the opportunity was\r\nwasted, and the heaps of flinty refuse left upon the river bank by the\r\nworkmen were the only record left of the nature of the work of that\r\nday. Two hundred years of aboriginal misfortune and Quaker inattention\r\nand neglect have resulted in so mixing up the simple evidence of\r\na day's work, that it has taken twenty-five years to collect the\r\nscattered fragments, to sift, separate and classify them, and to assign\r\nthem to theoretic places in a scheme of culture evolution that spans\r\nten thousand years.\r\n\r\nYet is there really nothing in it all, in the theories, the\r\nobservations, the collections and the books? Do I speak too positively\r\nin condemnation of the results of years of earnest investigation?\r\nPerhaps so, but the voluminous testimony is so overloaded with\r\ninaccuracies, the relics of unscientific method and misleading\r\nhypotheses, that every item must be sharply questioned; and the\r\nconclusions reached so far overstep the limits warranted by the\r\nevidence, that heroic measures alone can be effectual in determining\r\ntheir exact value. If, as many believe, vital errors have been\r\nembodied in the evidence presented by the advocates of the theory,\r\nit is impossible to state the case too strongly. Error once fully\r\nabsorbed into the literature of science has many advantages over the\r\ntardy truth; it is strongly fortified and must be attacked and exposed\r\nwithout fear or favor. Truth involved with it cannot permanently\r\nsuffer. If the twin theories of a gravel and a paleolithic man in\r\neastern America are to be assailed as unsound or as not properly\r\nsupported, it should be done now while the originators and upholders\r\nare alive and alert to sustain their positions or to yield to the\r\nadvances of truth. I do not wish to wrongly characterize or to unduly\r\nminimize the evidence brought to bear in favor of these theories. I do\r\nintend, however, to assist the world so far as possible in securing an\r\nexact estimate of all that has been said and done, and all that is to\r\nbe done.\r\n\r\nIn a previous article I have examined the evidence relating to\r\npaleolithic art in the eastern United States, and have indicated\r\nits utter inadequacy and unreliability. In this paper the testimony\r\nrelating to the occurrence of gravel art, in the locality most fully\r\nrelied upon by advocates of the theory, has been partially reviewed\r\nand subjected to the strong light of recent observations. It is found\r\nthat the whole fabric, so imposing in books and museums, shrinks away\r\nsurprisingly as it is approached. The evidence furnished by the bluff\r\nface and by the railway cutting, the two leading sites, is fatally\r\nweakened by the practical demonstration of the fact that the gravels\r\nproper are at these points barren of art remains. In endeavoring to\r\nnaturalize an immigrant hypothesis, our gravel searchers, unacquainted\r\nwith the true nature of the objects collected and discussed, and little\r\nskilled in the observation of the phenomena by means of which all\r\nquestions of age must be determined, have undoubtedly made grievous\r\nmistakes and have thus misled an expectant and credulous public.\r\n\r\nThe articles themselves, the so-called gravel finds, when closely\r\nstudied are found to tell their own story much more fully and\r\naccurately than it has heretofore been read by students of archeology.\r\nThis story is that the art of the Delaware valley is to all intents and\r\npurposes a unit, that there is nothing unique or especially primitive\r\nor ancient and nothing un-Indian in it all. All forms are found on\r\ndemonstrably recent sites of manufacture. The rude forms assigned\r\nby some to glacial times are all apparently \"wasters\" of Indian\r\nmanufacture. The large blades of \"Eskimo\" type are only the larger\r\nblades, knives and spear points of the Indian, separated arbitrarily\r\nfrom the body of the art-remains to subserve the ends of a theory,\r\ncertain obscure phenomena of occurrence having been found to give color\r\nto the proceeding. To place any part of this art, rude or elaborate,\r\npermanently in any other than the ordinary Indian category will take\r\nstronger proofs than have yet been developed in the region itself.\r\n\r\nThe question asked in the beginning, \"Are there traces of glacial man\r\nin the Trenton gravels?\" if not answered decisively in the negative,\r\nstands little chance, considering present evidence, of being answered\r\nin the affirmative. In view of the fact that numerous observations\r\nof apparent value have been made in other sections, there is yet\r\nsufficient reason for letting the query stand, and we may continue to\r\ncherish the hope that possibly by renewed effort and improved methods\r\nof investigation, something may yet be found in the Trenton gravels\r\nclearly demonstrative of the fascinating belief in a great antiquity\r\nfor the human race in America.\r\n\r\nThe evidence upon which _paleolithic man_ in America depends is so\r\nintangible that, unsupported by supposed analogies with European\r\nconditions and phenomena, and by the suggestions of an ideal scheme\r\nof culture progress, it would vanish in thin air; and if the theory of\r\na _glacial man_ can summon to its aid no better testimony than that\r\nfurnished by the examples examined in this paper, the whole scheme,\r\nso elaborately mounted and so confidently proclaimed, is in imminent\r\ndanger of early collapse.\r\n\r\n                                                        =W.

The reasons for this may be various,\r\nbut a fundamental reason is found in the tendency among the American\r\npeople in particular, and in this age in general, toward practicality\r\nin all things. Applied to education this practicality asks for a\r\ntraining which shall have a direct bearing upon the business of life to\r\nbe followed immediately after the training period is ended. It means\r\na differentiation of subjects and specialization in methods to adjust\r\nthe education to the different functions which the students taking it\r\nare preparing for. It calls for a professional education for those\r\nwho expect to become lawyers, doctors, ministers, or teachers,--a\r\ntechnical education for those who are to engage in the arts of the\r\nmechanical or civil engineer, or of the architect. It results not only\r\nin the establishment of colleges and universities devoted to this\r\nkind of education, but it affects the methods of the high schools and\r\nacademies, and is felt down to primary schools, and on the other hand\r\nthe older institutions founded on a different plan are adapted to the\r\npopular demand by the addition to the regular studies of \"electives,\"\r\nchosen not always for their value or disciplinary studies, but because\r\nof the practical applicability of the information to be derived from\r\nthem, to the business of the student.\r\n\r\nWithout discussing the relative merits of the two ideas of education,\r\nthe chief contrast between them may be found in the character of the\r\nresults sought. The knowledge of things and their uses is of chief\r\nimportance in the practical education; the knowledge of ideas and skill\r\nin their use is the aim of the liberal education. Geology is one of the\r\nsciences which most men will at once classify as among the practical\r\nsciences. It deals with matters of practical importance to everybody.\r\nCoal, iron, the metals, silver, gold, tin, lead, building stone, sand,\r\nclay, petroleum, and natural gas, and all geological products are\r\nessential materials of modern civilization, and a knowledge of them\r\nand of their modes and places of occurrence is one of the requisites\r\nof an education, either from the practical or the liberal point of\r\nview. So too the dynamics of atmospheric and hydraulic erosion, the\r\nagency of rivers and oceans in destruction, removal and reconstruction\r\nof geological formations have their eminently practical bearings upon\r\nthe various arts of engineering. While the practical value of geology\r\nis thus evident and undisputed, it is not on this account that its\r\nimportance as a part of a college course of education is urged. As\r\na practical study geology becomes the centre of a group of studies\r\nrequiring years for mastery. Chemistry and physics are primarily\r\nessential to a full understanding of the most common of geological\r\nproblems. And to use geological facts and phenomena, an acquaintance\r\nwith the complex methods of engineering, civil and mechanical, which\r\nagain call for a thorough mastery of mathematics, is necessary.\r\nMineralogy and petrography, metallurgy and mining engineering have\r\neach reached a stage of development entitling them to the rank of\r\nseparate sciences, but the practical training of the geologist should\r\ninclude them all. When we add the biological sciences connected with\r\nhistorical geology, paleontology, zoölogy and botany, with all the\r\nlaboratory and field work required for their proper study, we have a\r\ngroup of affiliated branches of learning requiring four or five years\r\nof continuous study after the student has learned how to study. It is\r\nplain therefore that only a specialist, one who is willing to neglect\r\nother studies, or who has previously had a liberal training, can\r\nperfect himself on the practical side in the science of geology.\r\n\r\nBut irrespective of its practical uses, as a means of training and\r\nsupplementary to the ordinary studies of a college curriculum, geology\r\nis one of the most useful of the sciences of observation. It is\r\nin providing that particular training to which President Eliot has\r\nrecently called attention in the _Forum_ (Dec., 1892, Wherein Popular\r\nEducation Has Failed), that geology can be used to such advantage.\r\nSpeaking particularly of the lower education, President Eliot says\r\nit is \"the judgment and reasoning powers\" that particularly require\r\nattention. Their systematic development is to be attained in the four\r\ndirections of \"observing accurately, recording correctly, comparing,\r\ngrouping and inferring justly, and expressing cogently the results of\r\nthese mental operations.\" (p. 421.) The attainment of these ends is\r\none of the purposes of liberal education, whether it be in the primary\r\nschool or in the university. And geology, or any other science, is\r\nof value in a college course in proportion to its fitness for the\r\nexercise and development of these functions of the student. Geology may\r\nbe taught without regard to these ends, and then it is valuable from\r\nthe practical point of view, but when we examine it in respect of its\r\navailability as a disciplinary study we find it offering particular\r\nattractions.\r\n\r\nUsing the distinction between theory and practice, which is as old\r\nas Aristotle, geology in its theoretical aspect is more easily\r\ncomprehended than is the theoretical aspect of most of the modern\r\nsciences. This arises first from the fact that the facts and phenomena\r\nare of a simple and grand nature, making it possible for the teacher\r\nto direct certain attention to the specific facts under consideration.\r\nThe water of the rivers, the mud by the road side, the rocks and sands\r\non the shore are familiar objects to all, and it is a simple matter to\r\ncall attention by ordinary language to the specific facts regarding\r\nthem, which, analyzed out, are to form the basis of exact ideas and\r\nscientific definition and classification. Geology is the one science\r\namong the natural sciences which may begin with the common language\r\nof the pupil, and by means of such language alone may build up ideas\r\nof precise phenomena in scientific terms. Physiography or physical\r\ngeography surpasses geology proper in this particular, as the admirable\r\nwork of Professor Davis is showing, and on this account it is the best\r\nintroduction to geology. But the very largeness and indefiniteness\r\nof the facts are in the way of the use of physical geography for the\r\nexercise of the finer and more exact functions of observation. The\r\ndisciplinary value of classics and mathematics is to a considerable\r\nextent derived from this quality, the precision with which the words\r\nor figures kindle like ideas. So long as the object of the training\r\nis to teach the knowledge of ideas and how to use them, classics and\r\nmathematics are the simplest and purest means of developing a liberal\r\neducation. The addition of sciences to the college course is not\r\nbecause of the usefulness of the knowledge of things thus to be gained,\r\nbut because the language of the sciences is essential to call forth the\r\nobservation and the exercise of the accompanying mental operations.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to dealing with the ideas associated with particular\r\nsense-observation, where form or motion can not be expressed in\r\nsimple mathematical terms, language can not communicate a new idea\r\nor kindle it in another mind with precision. It is necessary by some\r\nmeans to recall or to present the object itself to the student. In\r\nthe teaching of science this point is of great importance, and much\r\nof the unsatisfactoriness of science-teaching is doubtless due to\r\nfailure to note it. No circumlocution of words can arouse in another\r\nor communicate to him the idea appropriate to a sensation he has never\r\nfelt. The blind man whose eyes are opened sees men as trees walking.\r\n\r\nIn the use of science for elementary training (and the training\r\nis elementary until the student is capable of investigating and\r\ninterpreting the facts and phenomena of a science directly) that\r\nscience is the better which deals with objects which are simple, common\r\nand easily observed. Such is geology in some of its aspects. Every time\r\nthe student walks in the country he sees the facts discussed in the\r\ntext-book or by his teacher; and from attention to those with which he\r\nis already familiar he can be readily led to observe and give attention\r\nto others and to analyze those already in his mind by properly directed\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\nIn the field of geology are found the ready means for the exercise\r\nand development of observation and thought. The learner begins\r\nwith ideas which every intelligent mind associates with the objects\r\ndescribed or named, and by degrees the marks of his knowledge are\r\nincreased, the relations of things are grasped, and the content of his\r\nideas associated with the language of his science is enlarged. In the\r\nprocess of learning the science he has been building up his stock of\r\nknowledge of facts and phenomena, but, of more importance than that,\r\nhe has learned the method of observing and of scientific thinking.\r\nHe has had training in the methods of reducing the hard facts of\r\nnature to the laws of thought and practice, he has seen the method by\r\nwhich theoretical order is made out of the interminable confusion and\r\ncomplexity of natural things.\r\n\r\nBeside this primary reason for the use of geology as a disciplinary\r\nscience-study, there is a second reason arising from the symbolic\r\nnature of a large group of its facts. This aspect of the science is\r\nbest seen in the historical and stratigraphical parts of geology, in\r\nwhich fossils are the chief data for study. The interpretation of a\r\nfossil into a species of organism, having its definite place in the\r\nelaborate classification of the zoölogist, or as an indicator of\r\nthe time and place and mode of formation of the strata in which it\r\nis buried, is, to be sure, a most intricate and, at first thought\r\nit would seem, an unattractive process. But no more so, I would\r\nsay, than the interpretation of a series of Greek characters. The\r\ninterpretation of the Greek reveals to us the richest results of human\r\nthought and most perfect laws of human speech, and we find therefore\r\nin the analysis required the most perfect discipline of the powers\r\nof speech and language. The fossil too holds, ready to be revealed,\r\nthe story of the history of the world and the laws of the evolution\r\nof the organic life of the globe, and records an inexhaustible wealth\r\nof information regarding the laws of nature. But as an instrument of\r\nintellectual discipline its great merit lies in its symbolic nature.\r\nIt is this symbolic character of the classical languages and of the\r\nmathematics which fits them to be universal means of liberal training.\r\nThe symbolic nature of the fossil fits it to become the exponent of\r\ntraining in the pure science of nature. The fossil is a mark which\r\nstands for something, and thus, in the nature of things, it asks\r\nfor interpretation. As a symbol it stimulates minute and accurate\r\nobservation, and kindles close and exhaustive thought; as a symbol it\r\nleaves us the ideas it has engendered after it is lost to memory as\r\nan observation. Thus the value of its study does not depend upon the\r\nretention in the memory of the facts brought before the mind, but in\r\nthe training of the mental processes required in its interpretation.\r\nThe study of this branch of geology exercises and develops all the\r\nfaculties which are specially exercised in any scientific investigation.\r\n\r\nAnother aspect in which it is an ideal means for such training comes\r\nfrom the fact that it is equally valuable at every stage of progress\r\nof the student. When first examined it means nothing to him. He knows\r\nnothing of organism, of strata, of geological time. The fossil gains\r\nmeaning only as he is able to put meaning into it. The student must\r\nask questions, and as step by step he answers his questions by more\r\nminute and wider examination, the fossil holds a fuller interpretation.\r\nHis studies lead him to investigation of the whole field of nature,\r\nthe rocks, the formation of deposits, the action of the elements, the\r\nconditions of life, the forms of organism, their functions and habits,\r\nthe laws of growth, their adaptation to environment, the changes of\r\nevents in time, the efforts of association and struggle for life, the\r\nprinciples of evolution and development--the migration and origin and\r\nextinction of organisms on the globe. Nothing in nature is without\r\ninterest to him. Further than this the amount of good he gains is not\r\nmeasured by the number of fossils he studies, but by the wideness of\r\nhis research. A handful of fossils from some one fossiliferous ledge\r\nmay be the text for a year's study, and the methods acquired in the\r\nstudy may be the nucleus of a life's work. In this department of\r\ngeology the possibilities for new discoveries, new developments of\r\nscience are almost endless. As a single author thoroughly read develops\r\na wealth of knowledge of the laws of language and thought, so geology\r\nmay be studied by the use of a limited set of its phenomena and become\r\nthe introduction to the exhaustive study of natural science.\r\n\r\nAnother advantage attaching to geology as a science-study for the\r\ncollege curriculum, arises from the fact that it may be pursued deeply\r\nwithout the elaborate aid to the senses required in other sciences\r\nfor making minute record or measurement of facts or phenomena. As in\r\nlanguage and mathematics, it is essential to acquire a familiarity\r\nwith the grammar, the dictionary and the symbols, formulas and rules\r\nof their usage before the finer training in the use of thought begins,\r\nso the vocabulary and the definitions of a science must be acquired\r\nbefore much use can be made of the higher discipline to be derived from\r\nscientific study. In language study this higher training comes from\r\npractice in making the minute analysis, in detecting the fine shades\r\nof meaning expressed in the literature itself. So it is important in\r\nselecting a science to be used as a disciplinary study that the facts\r\nand laws of nature with which it is concerned should be capable of\r\nclear and precise definition, and, moreover, that it should furnish a\r\nfield for the study of the minute and intricate relationship existing\r\nbetween the different facts which are to be attained by personal\r\ninspection of the objects themselves. In most of the sciences this\r\ndeeper exercise of scientific thought requires for its successful\r\npursuit artificial aids to the common senses of observation. Chemistry\r\nmust have its purified acids and reagents, test tubes, and delicate\r\nscales for measurement of weight and volume. Mineralogy must have its\r\nchemical analyses, or optical measurements so fine that microscopes\r\nof highest power are essential tools for the investigation. Physics\r\nmust have the most delicate measurements of time and space and weight.\r\nBotany, for the earlier stages of study, is fully equal to geology in\r\nthese respects, but its scope is much less general. Zoölogy requires\r\ndissections calling for skill in manipulation, and in other respects\r\nis ill adapted to general classes. But precision in the intellectual\r\nprocesses of observation and reasoning can be cultivated in the use of\r\ngeological facts to their highest and widest perfection, with scarcely\r\nany aids to the normal faculties of observation. A couple of hammers,\r\na pocket lens, a chisel and a few pointed steel tools for revealing\r\nfossils, a tape line, compass and clinometer are the few equipments\r\nthat will enable the geologist to carry his investigations to almost\r\nany degree of thoroughness.\r\n\r\nWhat has already been said applies to the study of the pure science\r\nof geology either in the field or in the laboratory. There is\r\nstill another use to which this, as other sciences, may be put in\r\ndisciplining the college student in directions not provided for by\r\nliterary or mathematical studies,--the study of man as an investigator.\r\nIn the pursuit of the study of geology, the first instruction must be\r\nreceived in didactic form, but after the text-book and lecture stage\r\nis passed, or while it is under way consultation of the literature\r\nof the sciences is appropriate. In the use of scientific literature\r\nthe critical judgment is brought under training, and the varying\r\ninterpretations of well known phenomena by expert scientists suggest\r\nthe prominent part which the notions already in the mind play in\r\nthe interpretation of the external facts observed. The experienced\r\ngeologist will recall many cases of honest report of impossible facts\r\nby men who are unable to distinguish between what they saw and the\r\nfalse interpretations they made of these observations. One man will\r\nreport that a live toad jumped out of the middle of a solid piece of\r\ncoal, when it was heated in the stove; another will swear that he saw\r\na fossil shark's tooth taken out of a ledge of Trenton limestone.\r\nIt is evident that our memory of observation is not the revival of\r\nthe object producing the sensation, but of the idea we framed of the\r\nsensation at the time. The study of original descriptions of objects of\r\nnature reveals the fact that the describer uses the ideas he already\r\nhas in his mind as he does the standard foot-rule in his hand for\r\nmeasuring that which he describes, and it is by the study of scientific\r\nliterature and the comparison of views of many scientists that this\r\nhighest discipline of the observational faculties is attained--the\r\npower to determine the personal equation of error for the observer,\r\nand thus see through his descriptions a truer representation of the\r\nfacts than the observer himself saw. Geological literature is admirably\r\nadapted for this higher discipline, and in no field of science (I think\r\nnot in astronomy itself), has wider and more comprehensive thought been\r\napplied than in geology. While other branches of science have been\r\ndeveloped and become more narrow and special in their treatment of the\r\nfacts concerned, geology still stands as the most comprehensive of all\r\nthe sciences of nature.\r\n\r\n                                                        H.

The law of the phenomena appears to be that whenever the height\r\nof the prominence is less than one-half the base, measured transversely\r\nto the movement of the ice, the summit current will follow down the lee\r\nslope; but whenever the height of the prominence is more than one-half\r\nthe transverse base, the lateral currents will close in on the lee,\r\nand the summit current will flow off into the body of the ice. This\r\nsimple law is, however, subject to very considerable modifications from\r\nseveral different sources which may be grouped under (1) differences\r\nin the friction arising from basal contact, and (2) differences of\r\ninternal friction and mobility. The lateral currents will expose more\r\nsurface to the sides and base of the hill and the adjoining plain, and\r\nwill be more subject to conflicting currents, while, on the other hand,\r\nbeing deeper currents, they will presumably be more fluent. These and\r\nother qualifying conditions will go far to vitiate the application\r\nof the law, but its statement may have some value as representing a\r\ngeneral conception of the phenomena. When the height of the prominence\r\nbecomes great relative to the total thickness of the ice, the fluency\r\nof the summit current may be much reduced relative to that of the\r\ncentral parts of the lateral currents. When the prominence reaches the\r\nsurface, blocks dislodged from it are borne away on the surface of the\r\nglacier, and constitute superglacial drift. Blocks dislodged from near\r\nthe summit, but below the surface of the ice, are presumably carried\r\nonward in the upper zone of the glacier; while other blocks detached\r\nat various but sufficient heights on the side of the prominence are\r\ndoubtless borne around into the lee and carried forward in the same\r\nvertical plane as the summit stream, so that there comes to be a\r\nvertical zone set with boulders moving on from the lee side of the\r\nnunatak.\r\n\r\nLofty ledges or plateaus, with vertical or undercut faces, furnish\r\nsimilar means for the lodgment of debris within the body of the ice.\r\n\r\nIn these and doubtless in other ways it appears that there came to be\r\nlodged directly within the body of the Pleistocene glaciers at some\r\nconsiderable distances above their bases, blocks derived from rock\r\nprominences that rose with sufficient steepness above the general\r\nsurface of the country over which the ice passed. The lodgment of\r\ndebris on the lateral borders of glaciers is neglected here because\r\nit has little or no applicability to the phenomena of the upper\r\nMississippi basin. It is also doubtful whether any prominences\r\nprotruded through the ice except near the thin edge, when advancing and\r\nretreating, and these are too inconsiderable to merit attention.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious, upon consideration, that blocks detached from summits\r\nor from the sharp angles of out-jutting ledges or plateaus might\r\nsuffer some glacial abrasion in the process of their dislodgment and\r\ntransposition along the crest or projecting angle, but that in general\r\nsuch abrasion would be small, and, in most cases, nearly or quite\r\nabsent. The debris so incorporated in the body of the ice would be,\r\nfor the most part, angular, and, as it was brought forward in the ice,\r\nit would probably suffer very little abrasion. If it continued to move\r\nforward in the plane in which it started, descending only so much as\r\nthe bottom wastage of the ice required, it would be brought out to\r\nthe terminal slope of the ice sheet by virtue of the melting away of\r\nthe ice above, and thence it would be carried on down the terminal\r\nslope as superglacial debris, and dropped at the frontal edge. If this\r\nbe the true and full history, there would be no commingling of this\r\nenglacial matter with the subglacial debris. It is evident, that the\r\nenglacial matter brought forward from the crest of one prominence would\r\nbe intermingled with that brought forward from other prominences lying\r\nin a line with it, or lying so near it that the lateral spreading of\r\nthe debris would lead to commingling. It is also clear that variations\r\nin the direction of currents would tend to the same result, so that\r\nenglacial matter from different prominences of the same general region\r\nmight be commingled. So also englacial material, by crevassing and by\r\nthe descent of streams from the surface to the base, would be carried\r\ndown to the bottom and mingled with the subglacial debris. So also\r\nblocks broken away from the base of the prominence which yielded the\r\nenglacial erratics might be moved forward along the bottom parallel\r\nwith the englacial material above, and lodged at any point along the\r\nline. It is therefore to be expected that the basal deposits will\r\ncontain the same rock species as the englacial, but if there be no\r\nprocess by which the basal material is carried upward the reverse will\r\nnot be the case, and there will be a clear distinction between the\r\nenglacial deposit and the subglacial deposit, in composition as well as\r\nphysical state.\r\n\r\nNot a few glacialists, however, advocate in somewhat differing forms\r\nand phases the doctrine that basal material is carried upward into\r\nthe body of the glacier and at length reaches the surface, and that\r\nat the extremity of the ice this is commingled with any erratics that\r\nmay be englacial or superglacial by original derivation. This doctrine\r\nappears to have had its origin in the endeavor to explain the very\r\ncommon fact that glacial drift has been carried from lower to higher\r\naltitudes. Erratics are often found lodged several hundred feet higher\r\nthan the outcrop from which they were derived. It has never seemed to\r\nme, however, that this phenomenon necessarily was different in kind\r\nfrom that which takes place in the bottom of every stream; at least I\r\nhave not come in contact with any instances that seemed to require a\r\ndifferent explanation, except those connected with kames and eskers\r\nthat require a special explanation in any case. We are so accustomed\r\nto view streams from above, and so accustomed to study the extinct\r\nglaciers from the bottom, that we are liable to overlook the community\r\nof some of the simpler processes involved alike in both phenomena. The\r\ndictum that water never runs up hill is measurably true of the surface\r\ncurrents of the ice as well as water, but it altogether fails when\r\napplied to the basal currents of either. It is probable that there is\r\nno natural stream of any length in which, at some part of its course,\r\nbasal debris is not carried from lower to higher altitudes and lodged\r\nthere. If the bed of any stream were made dry and the debris in it\r\ncritically examined, it would be found that at numerous points the\r\nsilts or sands or gravels had been carried from the bottom of some\r\nbasin in its bed to the higher rim or bar or reef that bordered it\r\non the downstream side. So I conceive that, on a grander scale, the\r\nnatural result of the flow of the basal ice of a continental glacier\r\nover the inequalities of the country was the lifting of material from\r\nsome of the lower horizons and its lodgment on the crests of ridges or\r\nthe slopes or summits of mountains that lay athwart its course.\r\n\r\nSo again, it is certain that a considerable part of the peripheral\r\ndrainage of glaciers takes place through tunnels beneath the ice.\r\nIt is reasonable to suppose that during the winter season, when the\r\ndrainage is slack, these tunnels tend to collapse in greater or less\r\ndegree, under the continued pressure of the ice and the \"fattening\" of\r\nthe glacier, so that in the early part of the next melting season the\r\ncontracted tunnels may be over-flooded by glacial waters. To the extent\r\nthat these tunnels become incompetent the water would become ponded\r\nback in the crevasses and moulins by which the surface-water gains\r\naccess to them. They thus come to have something of the force of water\r\nflowing in tubes, and may be presumed to be capable of forcing rounded\r\nmaterial to some considerable height, and of carrying ice-imbedded\r\nboulders to any point reached by the stream. These tunnels probably\r\nundulate with the bottom, and lodgment along them takes place wherever\r\nenlargement permits.\r\n\r\nWithout, therefore, appealing to any upward cross currents within\r\nthe ice itself, it is possible to explain the transportation of the\r\ndrift from lower to higher altitudes. I have never seen phenomena of\r\nthis kind that seemed to call for any other explanation than these. I\r\nam not prepared to say that there are no such phenomena. One of the\r\npurposes of this article will have been accomplished, if it shall call\r\nforth a critical statement of phenomena that require the assumption\r\nof internal upward movements of the ice to account for them, and of\r\nthe criteria which distinguish such phenomena from those that may be\r\nreferred to upward basal movements such as are common to all streams\r\nor to the exceptionally conditioned subglacial streams. That there are\r\nupward internal movements in most streams is as much beyond question\r\nas the existence of upward basal currents in rivers and glaciers, but\r\nthey are dependent chiefly upon the velocity of the current and the\r\nirregularity of the bottom. Theoretically, as I understand, a stream\r\nmoving in a straight course on a perfectly smooth bottom would not\r\ndevelop an upward cross current. Each lower layer would move slower\r\nthan that above it by reason of basal friction, but they would move\r\non in parallel lines. But if irregularity of bottom be introduced the\r\nparallelism is obviously destroyed, and if the velocity be high so that\r\nthe momentum of the particles becomes great relative to their cohesion,\r\nirregular internal movements will result, and these will often be of a\r\nrotary nature in vertical planes bringing the basal parts of the fluid\r\nto the surface or the reverse. For this reason rapid streams abound in\r\nrotary currents, while slow streams do not.\r\n\r\nNow it is quite obvious that a stream of water moving at a rate of\r\nthree or four feet per day, or even fifty or sixty feet per day, would\r\nnot develop perceptible upward currents, and certainly would not\r\nlift the lightest silt from its bottom. I do not think there are any\r\ntheoretical grounds for believing that internal glacial currents are\r\ndeveloped, which flow from base to surface, carrying bottom debris to\r\nthe top.\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable expressions of the drift phenomena of the\r\nUpper Mississippi region consists of belts of boulders stretching\r\nfor great distances over the face of the country, and disposing\r\nthemselves in great loops after the fashion of the terminal moraines\r\nof the region with which they are intimately connected. Besides this,\r\nthere are numerous patches of boulders of more or less irregular form\r\nand uncertain relations. The whole of these have not been studied\r\nin detail, but a sufficient portion of them have received careful\r\nexamination to justify the drawing of certain conclusions from them.\r\nThose which have been most studied lie in Ohio, Indiana, Illinois,\r\nMichigan, Wisconsin, Iowa and Dakota. Those of the first three States\r\nhave been most carefully traced and their constitution is such as to\r\ngive them the greatest discriminative value. To these our discussion\r\nwill be limited chiefly.[11]\r\n\r\n[11] Parts of these tracts were long since described by Bradley of\r\nthe Illinois Survey. (Geol. Surv. Ill., Vol. IV. p. 227). Collet of\r\nthe Indiana Survey (An. Rep. 1875, p. 404) and Orton and Hussey of\r\nthe Ohio Survey (Geol. Surv. Ohio, Vol. III., pp. 412, 414 and 475).\r\nThe relationship of these tracts to morainic lines and to each other\r\nI worked out some years since (Third An. Rep. U. S. G. S. pp. 331,\r\n332, 334) but I owe many details and some important additions to my\r\nassociate, Mr. Leverett.\r\n\r\nEmerging from the dunes at a point north of the Iroquois river in\r\nJasper county, northwestern Indiana, a well characterized belt of\r\nsurface boulders stretches westward to the State line, just beyond\r\nwhich it curves about to the south and then to the east, and re-enters\r\nIndiana a little south of the northwest corner of Benton county. It\r\nsoon turns abruptly to the south and reaches the Wabash river near the\r\ncentre of Warren county. The immediate valley of the Wabash is thickly\r\nstrewn with boulders from the point where the belt reaches it to the\r\nvicinity of West Point on the western line of Tippecanoe county. The\r\nuplands, however, do not give any clear indication of the continuity\r\nof the belt, and the connection is not altogether certain. There is an\r\ninner well-marked belt that branches away from this in the central part\r\nof Benton county and runs southeasterly into the northwestern quarter\r\nof Tippecanoe county, beyond which only scattered boulders occur, which\r\nleaves its precise connections also in doubt. But starting from West\r\nPoint, which is less than a dozen miles from the point where the two\r\nbelts cease to be traceable with certainty, a well-defined belt, one\r\nor two miles wide, runs southeasterly across the southwestern corner\r\nof Tippecanoe county and the northeastern quarter of Montgomery county\r\nto the vicinity of Darlington, beyond which its connection is again\r\nobscure, although boulders occur frequently between this point and the\r\nnorthwestern corner of Brown county, where boulders are very abundant.\r\nSo also, patches of exceptionally abundant boulders occur in the west\r\ncentral part of Clinton county. These may be entitled to be regarded\r\nas a connecting link between the train which enters northwestern\r\nTippecanoe county and that of northwestern Boone county, as scattered\r\nboulders of the surface type, but of not very exceptionally frequent\r\noccurrence, lie between them. However this may be, a belt of much\r\nmore than usually frequent surface boulders stretches southeasterly\r\nto the vicinity of Indianapolis, and probably connects with a very\r\nwell-marked belt lying near the south line of the southeast quarter\r\nof Marion county and in the northeastern part of Johnson county.\r\nThere is also a well-defined tract in southeastern Hendricks county,\r\nrunning east and west, without evident connection with the foregoing\r\ntracts, though it may be the equivalent of the Darlington belt. There\r\nis also a somewhat unusual aggregation in the form of irregular belts\r\nin southeastern Johnson county, in the vicinity of Nineveh, and in\r\nsouthern Shelby county. The belt south of Indianapolis is probably to\r\nbe correlated by scattered boulders only slightly more abundant than\r\nthose of the adjacent region, but of the surface type, stretching\r\nnortheasterly to near the center of the west half of Henry county,\r\nwhere a well-marked belt again sets in. From this point the tract runs\r\nnortheasterly nearly to the north limit of the county, where it turns\r\neasterly and runs in the vicinity of the line between Randolph and\r\nWayne counties to near the Ohio line, where it curves to the southeast\r\nentering Ohio near the northwest corner of Preble county. In its\r\nsoutheasterly course across that county it is phenomenally developed as\r\nhas been well shown by the descriptions of Professor Orton. Soon after\r\nentering Montgomery county it curves about to a northeasterly course,\r\nand crossing the great Miami river, a few miles above Dayton, holds\r\nits northeast course across the southeastern part of Miami county,\r\nthe northwestern part of Champaign county, and thence on to about the\r\ncenter of Logan county, where it curves about and runs in a direction a\r\nlittle east of south to near the southeast corner of Champaign county,\r\nbeyond which it ceases to be a specially notable phenomenon.\r\n\r\nIn the region between the Wabash and Kankakee rivers, in northern\r\nIndiana, there are numerous tracts of irregular form over which surface\r\nboulders in phenomenal abundance are scattered. These are particularly\r\nnoticeable in southern Jasper county; in the vicinity of Wolcott, Monon\r\nand Chalmers in White county; near Star City in Pulaski county; in\r\nthe southeastern corner of Stark county, and very generally along the\r\ngreat interlobate moraines, lying parallel with the Eel river, and\r\nsome others of the Saginaw glacial lobe. These are so associated with\r\nthe inter-tangled morainic phenomena of that region as not to admit of\r\nconvenient and brief description in their genetic relationships.\r\n\r\nThe well-defined tracts have a most significant distribution. The first\r\npart described is associated with the terminal moraine that marked\r\nthe margin of a lobe of ice that moved westward along the axis of the\r\nIroquois basin to a point a few miles beyond the Indiana-Illinois line.\r\nThe portion that runs southward to the Wabash is associated with the\r\nmoraine that follows the same course, and runs at right angles over the\r\nolder moraines of the Lake Michigan lobe. The tract in Tippecanoe and\r\nMontgomery counties, that in south Marion county, and that in Henry and\r\nRandolph counties, in the eastern part of the state, are associated\r\nwith the terminal moraines that form a broad loop with the West White\r\nriver basin lying in its axis. In western Ohio the belt is intimately\r\nassociated with a moraine that bordered the Miami lobe of the ice\r\nsheet, and the south-trending portion in eastern Logan and Champaign\r\ncounties lies on the western margin of the Scioto lobe.\r\n\r\nThe relationship of these tracts to terminal moraines is very clear and\r\nspecific. They constitute marginal phenomena of the ancient ice sheet.\r\nTheir distribution completely excludes their reference to floating ice,\r\nfor they not only undulate over the surface utterly negligent of any\r\nhorizontal distribution, but they are disposed in loops in crossing the\r\nbasins of the region, and the convexities of these loops are turned\r\ndown stream. These basins for the most part open out in southerly or\r\nwesterly directions which makes it improbable that ice-bearing bodies\r\nof water occupied them. But if this were not fatal, certainly the\r\nfact that the convexities of the boulder belts are turned down stream\r\nand cross the centers of the basins is precisely contrary to the\r\ndistribution they must have assumed if they were due to floating ice\r\nin bodies of water occupying the basins. I hold it, therefore, to be\r\nbeyond rational question that these tracts were deposited as we find\r\nthem by the margins of the glacial lobes that invaded the region.\r\n\r\nIf these boulder belts were of the same nature as the average boulders\r\nof the till-sheets beneath them, then the simple fact of unusual\r\naggregation might be plausibly referred to the accidents of gathering\r\nand deposition. But they are very clearly distinguished from the\r\naverage boulders of the till by several characteristics.\r\n\r\n1. They are superficial. Sometimes they rest completely on the surface,\r\nsometimes they are very slightly imbedded, sometimes half buried,\r\nsometimes they protrude but a slight portion, and sometimes they are\r\nentirely concealed, but lie immediately at the surface. In all cases\r\nthe aggregation is distinctly superficial. Where they are buried, the\r\nburying material is usually of different texture and composition from\r\nthe subjacent till, and appears to be distinct in origin from it. The\r\nsuperficiality of the tract is very obvious almost everywhere, and is\r\nespecially so in regions where the subjacent till is of the pebble-clay\r\nrather than boulder-clay order, for the comparative absence of boulders\r\nbelow emphasizes the contrast. Throughout most of the region the\r\nsubjacent till is not of a very bouldery type, so that the distinction\r\nis generally a marked one.\r\n\r\n2. The boulders of the belts are almost without exception derivatives\r\nfrom the crystalline terranes of Canada. Those of the great tract\r\nespecially under consideration were derived from the typical Huronian\r\nrocks of the region north of Lake Huron, and from granitic and\r\ngneissoid rocks referable to the Laurentian series of the same region.\r\nThese last, however, cannot be sharply distinguished from the granitic\r\nrocks derived from other parts of the Laurentian terrane. The Huronian\r\nrocks are very easily identified because of the peculiarities of some\r\nof the species. Among these the one most conspicuously characterized\r\nis a quartz-and-jasper conglomerate. The matrix is usually a whitish\r\nquartzite. This is studded with pebbles of typical red jasper and of\r\nduller rocks of jasperoid nature, which grade thence into typical\r\nquartzite pebbles. With these are mingled crystalline pebbles of other\r\nvarieties. Another peculiar erratic comes from the \"slate conglomerate\"\r\nof Logan. It consists of a slaty matrix through which are scattered\r\nrather distantly pebbles of granitic, quartzitic and other crystalline\r\nrocks. This is one of the forms of the \"basal conglomerate\" of Irving.\r\nOther varieties of this \"basal conglomerate\" are present. In addition\r\nto these very peculiar rocks, a quartzite of a very light greenish\r\nsemi-translucent hue has a wide distribution along the tract. It is\r\nreadily distinguishable from the numerous other quartzites of the drift\r\nof the interior. Some years since, on returning from my first field\r\nexamination of a portion of this belt, I sent a typical series of chips\r\nfrom the characteristic erratics to Professor Irving, who had recently\r\nreturned from the study of the original Huronian region. He returned a\r\nsuite of chippings that matched them perfectly throughout, all of which\r\nwere taken _in situ_ in the region north of Lake Huron.\r\n\r\nAmong the boulders of the belt are occasionally found specimens of\r\nimpure limestone or of limy sandstone that might perhaps be referred\r\ndoubtfully to some member of the paleozoic series; but on the other\r\nhand, might with equal or greater probability perhaps be referred to\r\nthe similar rocks of the Huronian series. These are quite rare, never\r\nforming, so far as my observations go, as much as one per cent. of\r\nthe series. In the several definite enumerations made to determine\r\nthe percentage of the doubtful specimens, the result never exceeded\r\na fraction of one per cent. In the most extensive enumeration the\r\nresult was about one-half of one per cent. Aside from these doubtful\r\nspecimens there are practically no boulders in the belts that can be\r\nreferred to any of the paleozoic rocks that intervene in the 500 miles\r\nbetween the parent series north of Lake Huron and the tract over which\r\nthe boulders are now strewn. Occasionally there may be seen erratics\r\nfrom the paleozoic series at or near the surface, but they are not\r\nusually so disposed on the surface as to appear to be true members of\r\nthe superficial boulder tract. There is, therefore, the amplest ground\r\nfor the assertion that these boulder tracts are of distant derivation,\r\nand that they are essentially uncommingled with derivatives from the\r\nintermediate region.\r\n\r\n3. The boulders of this series are much more angular than those of\r\nthe typical till sheets. Some of them, indeed, are rounded, but the\r\nrounding is generally of the type which boulders derived by surface\r\ndegradation and exfoliation present. They rarely have the forms that\r\nare distinctively glacial. Quite a large percentage are notably\r\nangular, and have neither suffered glacial rounding nor spherical\r\nexfoliation. Some few are glacially worn and scratched, but the\r\npercentage of these is small.\r\n\r\nThe tracts therefore present these four salient characteristics: (1)\r\nthe boulders are derived from distant crystalline terranes (400 to 500\r\nmiles) and are essentially uncommingled with rock from the intervening\r\npaleozoic terranes; (2) they are essentially superficial, and the\r\nassociated earthy material has a texture differing from that of the\r\nsubglacial tills; (3) they are notably angular and free from glacial\r\nabrasion, except in minor degree; (4) the tracts are so associated with\r\nterminal moraines and so related to the topography of the region, that\r\nthere is no rational ground for doubt that the boulders were borne to\r\ntheir present places by the glaciers that produced the correlative\r\nmoraines.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to these superficial boulder formations, the till sheets\r\nbelow are made up of a very large percentage of glacial clay whose\r\nconstitution shows that it was produced in part by the grinding down\r\nof the paleozoic series. In this are imbedded boulders and pebbles\r\nthat were derived from the paleozoic series as indicated by their\r\npetrological character, and, in many instances, demonstrated by\r\ncontained fossils. While a small part of the boulders contained in the\r\ntill are angular or but slightly worn, the larger part are blunted,\r\nbruised, scratched and polished by typical glacial action. This obvious\r\ngrinding of the boulders, taken in connection with the clay product\r\nresulting from the grinding, affords a clear demonstration that the\r\ndeposit was produced at the base of the ice by its pushing, dragging,\r\nrolling action.\r\n\r\nThe two formations, therefore, stand in sharp contrast; the one\r\nindicating the passive transporting action of the ice in bearing from\r\ntheir distant homes north of the lakes the crystalline boulders and\r\ndropping them quietly on the surface, the other indicating the active\r\ndynamic function of the ice in rubbing, bruising and scoring the\r\nmaterial at its base. The one seems to me a clear instance of englacial\r\nand superglacial transportation; the other an equally clear example of\r\nsubglacial push, drag and kneading.\r\n\r\nNow if it were the habit of an ice-sheet of this kind to carry material\r\nfrom its bottom to the surface by internal movement, it would seem\r\nthat the distance of 400 to 500 miles which intervened between the\r\nsource of the crystallines and the place of their deposit would have\r\nfurnished ample opportunity for its exercise, and that there would\r\nhave been commingled with the englacial and superglacial material many\r\nderivatives from the intermediate region, and these derivatives should\r\nhave borne the characteristic markings received by them while at the\r\nbase of the ice. The very conspicuous absence of such commingling,\r\nand the absence or phenomenal rarity of anything that even looks like\r\nsuch a commingling, appears to me to testify in quite unmistakable\r\nterms to the distinctness of the methods of transportation. In view\r\nof the great territory over which this particular belt is spread,\r\nand the greater territory which is embraced in the other tracts not\r\nhere specially considered, there is left little ground for doubt\r\nthat this distinctness of englacial from basal transportation was\r\na prevailing fact and not an exceptional one. This is supported\r\nby concurrent evidence derived from the territory west of Lake\r\nMichigan. This territory unfortunately does not bear erratics that\r\nhave equally distinct characteristics, but, so far as my observation\r\ngoes, the phenomena are alike throughout. I am therefore brought to\r\nthe conclusion that, in the interior at least, there was no habitual\r\nlifting of boulders from the base of the ice sheets to the surface,\r\nnor any habitual commingling of basal with englacial and superglacial\r\nmaterial, except, of course, as it took place by virtue of the falling\r\nof the latter through crevasses to the base, and by mechanical\r\nintermixture of the two at the edge of the ice.\r\n\r\nThe amount of englacial till under this view is little more than that\r\nwhich was lodged in the body of the ice in its passage over the knobs\r\nand ridges of the hilly and semi-mountainous regions of the north. To\r\nthis is perhaps to be added occasional derivatives from the more abrupt\r\nprominences of the paleozoic region and the superficial dust blown upon\r\nthe ice from the surrounding land, which was probably the chief source\r\nof the silty material intermingled with the superficial boulders. The\r\ntotal amount is thus quite small, though important in its significance.\r\n\r\nThe eskers and kames of the region are made up of derivatives from\r\nthe basal material as shown by (1) the local origin of the material\r\nin large part, (2) the mechanical origin of the sands and silts, (3)\r\nthe not infrequent glacial markings of the pebbles and boulders, and\r\n(4) the disturbed stratification of the beds.[12] If I am correct\r\nin respect to the kind and amount of the englacial and superglacial\r\nmaterial, it is obvious that eskers and kames, such as are found in the\r\ninterior, could not be derived from englacial or superglacial sources.\r\nThe term englacial as here used does not include such materials as\r\nmay be lodged in the basal stratum of the ice and brought down to the\r\nactual bottom by basal melting.\r\n\r\n[12] See \"Hillocks of Angular Gravel and Disturbed Stratification,\" Am.\r\nJour.

Certain recent\r\npublications have served to emphasize the differences between them.\r\nThere are two questions, at least, concerning which there must be\r\nagreement, or at any rate a common understanding, before existing\r\ndifferences can be eliminated or justly evaluated. When the answers\r\nto these questions have been agreed upon, or when the positions of\r\nthe contending parties are clearly understood, it may be found that\r\nsome of the apparent antagonisms have no better basis than differences\r\nin definition. Stated interrogatively, the two questions referred to\r\nare these: 1. What constitutes a glacial epoch as distinct from other\r\nglacial epochs? and 2. What are the criteria for the recognition of\r\ndistinct glacial epochs, if such there were?\r\n\r\n\r\nII. =The Idea of a Glacial Epoch.=\r\n\r\nIt is conceivable that, after the development and extension of a\r\ncontinental ice-sheet, it might be wholly wasted away. The maximum\r\nextension of such an ice-sheet would mark the culmination of a glacial\r\nepoch. If subsequently another ice-sheet of considerable dimensions\r\nwere accumulated, its development and extension would constitute a\r\nsecond glacial epoch. These successive ice-sheets might be so related\r\nto each other in time, in position, and in the sequence of geological\r\nevents, as to be regarded as separate epochs of the same glacial\r\nperiod.[14] On the other hand they might be so widely separated from\r\neach other in time, in position, and in the sequence of geological\r\nevents, as to make their reference to separate glacial periods more\r\nappropriate. In any case their separation would be sufficiently marked\r\nto necessitate their reference to separate ice epochs. So far we\r\nbelieve there would be no disagreement.\r\n\r\n[14] The terms period and epoch are here used in the sense in which\r\nthey have been used most commonly in the literature of glacial geology\r\nin the United States.\r\n\r\nIf, instead of entirely disappearing, the first ice-sheet suffered\r\ngreat reduction of volume and area, and if this reduction were followed\r\nby a second great expansion of the ice, might the time of such\r\nexpansion be regarded as a second glacial epoch of the common glacial\r\nperiod? To this question, too, as thus stated, we apprehend there would\r\nbe but one answer, and that affirmative.\r\n\r\nIt seems certain that the edge of the continental ice-sheet was subject\r\nto more or less extensive oscillations, as are the ends of glaciers\r\nand the edges of ice-sheets to-day. How much of an oscillation is\r\nnecessary, and under what attendant conditions must it take place, in\r\norder that the recession of the ice-edge shall mark an interglacial and\r\nits re-advance a distinct glacial epoch? When the question takes this\r\nspecific form, and when inquiry is made concerning the quantitative\r\nvalue of the different elements entering into the problem, we reach\r\nthe battled ground. It is the battled ground, partly because it is\r\nthe ground of misunderstanding. It is the ground of misunderstanding,\r\npartly because glacialists are not agreed as to the meaning of certain\r\nterms in common use by them.\r\n\r\nFour elements seem to enter into the idea of an ice epoch as distinct\r\nfrom other ice epochs. These are (1) the distance to which the ice\r\nretreated between successive advances; (2) the duration of the retreat,\r\nor the time which elapsed between successive ice extensions; (3) the\r\ntemperature of the region freed from ice during the time between maxima\r\nof advance; and (4) the intervention between successive advances, of\r\nchanges interrupting the continuity of geological processes.\r\n\r\n(1.) It would be arbitrary to name any definite distance to which\r\nthe ice must recede in order to constitute its re-advance a distinct\r\nice epoch. It would be not so much a question of miles as a question\r\nof proportions. Considering this point alone, we presume it would\r\nbe agreed that an ice-sheet should have suffered the loss of a very\r\nconsiderable proportion of its mass, and that it should have dwindled\r\nto proportions very much less than those subsequently attained, before\r\nits re-advance could properly be called a separate glacial epoch. To be\r\nspecific, if the North American ice-sheet, after its maximum extension,\r\nretreated so far as to free the whole of the United States from ice,\r\nwe should be inclined to regard a re-advance as marking a distinct\r\nice epoch of the same glacial period, if in such re-advance the ice\r\nreached an extension comparable with that of the earlier ice-sheet.\r\nEspecially should we be inclined to refer the second ice advance to a\r\nsecond glacial epoch, if it, as well as the preceding retreat, were\r\naccompanied by favoring phases of some or all the other three elements\r\nentering into the notion of a glacial epoch. In this statement we\r\ndo not overlook the fact that a northerly region--as Labrador or\r\nGreenland--might be continuously covered with ice throughout the time\r\nof the two glaciations of the more southerly regions. But this is not\r\nregarded as a sufficient reason for discarding the notion of duality.\r\nGreenland has very likely been experiencing continuous glaciation since\r\na time antedating that of our first glacial deposits. The renewal\r\nto-day of glaciation comparable in extent to that of the glacial period\r\nwould certainly be regarded as a distinct glacial epoch, if not a\r\ndistinct glacial period, even though Greenland's glaciation may not\r\nhave been interrupted. Scandinavia and Switzerland have probably not\r\nbeen freed from ice since the glacial period. Their snow and ice fields\r\nare probably the direct descendants of the ice fields of the glacial\r\nperiod. An expansion of the existing bodies of ice in these countries\r\nto their former dimensions, would constitute a new glacial epoch, if\r\nnot a new glacial period. Analogous subdivisions in pre-Pleistocene\r\nformations have been frequently recognized.\r\n\r\n(2) The application of the time element is hardly susceptible of\r\nquantitative statement. We are inclined to think that it would be\r\ngenerally agreed that, with a given amount of recession of the ice, its\r\nre-advance would be more properly regarded as a distinct glacial epoch\r\nif the interval which had elapsed since the first advance were long.\r\nWhether a longer time between the separate advances might reduce the\r\namount of recession necessary in order to constitute the second advance\r\na second epoch, we are not prepared to assert; but we are inclined to\r\nthink it might.\r\n\r\n(3) The third element is perhaps somewhat more tangible than the\r\nsecond. If, during the retreat of the ice, the climate of a region\r\nwhich was twice glaciated became as temperate as that of the present\r\nday in the same locality, we should be inclined to regard the preceding\r\nand succeeding glaciations as distinct ice epochs, especially if the\r\nintervening recession were great and its duration long.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for simplicity and ease of determination, there are\r\ndifficulties in determining with precision how far the ice retreated\r\nbetween successive maxima of advance, how long the interval during\r\nwhich it remained in retreat, and the extent to which the climate was\r\nameliorated, as compared with that which went before and that which\r\nfollowed.\r\n\r\n(4) If changes of any sort which interrupt the continuity of geological\r\nprocesses intervened between successive maxima of advance of the ice,\r\nthe separation of the later advance from the earlier, as a distinct\r\nice epoch, would be favored. How great the intervening changes should\r\nbe in order to constitute the re-advance a distinct ice epoch, is a\r\npoint concerning which there might be difference of opinion. But it is\r\naltogether possible that such changes might intervene as alone to give\r\nsufficient basis for the separation. Orographic movements, resulting\r\neither in continental changes of altitude or attitude are among the\r\nevents which might come in to separate one ice epoch from another.\r\nChanges of this sort have often furnished the basis for the major\r\nand minor divisions of time in other parts of geological history, so\r\nthat there can be no question as to their adequacy, if they were of\r\nsufficient magnitude. We hold that the intervention of orographic or\r\nother important geologic changes might reduce to a minimum the amount\r\nof recession, the duration of the recession, and the warmth of the\r\nintervening climate necessary to constitute the separate ice advances\r\nseparate ice epochs. The absence of great orographic or other changes\r\nin glaciated regions between successive advances of the ice would be\r\nno proof that such advances should not be regarded as separate epochs.\r\nDivisions of equal importance have often been made without evidence of\r\nsuch changes.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing discussion, brief as it is, it will be seen that\r\nwithin certain narrow limits the definition of a glacial epoch, as\r\ndistinct from other glacial epochs, must be more or less arbitrary.\r\nIt is less important that an arbitrary definition should be accepted,\r\nthan that the same meaning should be attached to technical terms in\r\ncommon use among geologists. In the interest of harmony and of a common\r\nunderstanding, and without the violation of any truth of science, we\r\nbelieve it would be well if the conception of a glacial epoch, as\r\nframed by those who are our leaders in position and in fact, were made\r\nthe basis for our usage of the term.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. =The Criteria of Distinct Glacial Epochs.=\r\n\r\nIf there have been differences of opinion concerning the nature of ice\r\nepochs, as distinct from each other and from ice periods, there has\r\nbeen a failure to adequately apprehend the nature, the extent, and the\r\nmeaning of the real criteria on which the final recognition of separate\r\nice epochs, if such there were, must be based.\r\n\r\nSuch criteria are several in number. They are of unequal value. In some\r\ninstances a single one of them might be quite sufficient to establish\r\nthe fact of two ice epochs. In other cases, single criteria which might\r\nnot be in themselves demonstrative, have great corroborative weight,\r\nwhen found in association with others. In all cases, much discretion\r\nmust be used in the interpretation of these criteria. They may be\r\nenumerated under several specific heads.\r\n\r\n(1) _Forest Beds._ Beds of vegetal deposits or old soils are frequently\r\nfound between layers of glacial drift. This is one of the criteria\r\nmost commonly cited, because it is of common occurrence and easy of\r\nrecognition. The advocates of the unity of the glacial period maintain\r\nthat such beds of organic matter might become interbedded with morainic\r\ndebris during minor oscillations of the ice's edge. The phenomena of\r\nexisting glaciers make it evident that forest beds or soils might\r\nbe enclosed by the deposits of an oscillating ice edge. By repeated\r\noscillations of the ice's edge during the general retreat of the ice,\r\nsuch vegetal beds might become interstratified with glacial drift more\r\nor less frequently over all the area once covered by the ice, and from\r\nwhich it has now disappeared. The mere presence of vegetable material\r\nbetween beds of drift is therefore no proof of distinct ice epochs.\r\nThis does not destroy the value of the vegetal beds as a criterion for\r\nthe recognition of distinct ice epochs, but it makes caution necessary\r\nin its application. It does not follow that, since _some_ inter-drift\r\nforest-beds do not prove interglacial epochs, _none_ do. The question\r\nis not how forest-beds might originate, but how existing forest-beds\r\ndid originate.\r\n\r\nWhere the plant-remains found in the relations indicated are so well\r\npreserved as to make identification of the species possible, we have\r\na means of determining, with some degree of accuracy, the climatic\r\nconditions which must have obtained at the place where the plants grew\r\nduring the time of their life. If these interbedded plant-remains are\r\nof such a character as to indicate a temperate climate, we can not\r\nsuppose that they grew at the immediate edge of the ice, and therefore\r\nthat they were buried beneath its oscillating margin. To be specific,\r\nif the inter-drift plant remains in any given locality of the area\r\nonce covered by ice are such as to indicate a climate _as warm as the\r\npresent in the same locality_, the ice must have receded so far to the\r\nnorthward that its re-advance might, in our judgment, appropriately be\r\nregarded as a separate ice epoch.\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested in opposition that temperate conditions may\r\nobtain even up to the edge of the ice, and that interbedded vegetal\r\nremains indicating temperate climate do not prove any considerable\r\nrecession of the ice. The phenomena about existing glaciers have been\r\nappealed to in support of this demurrer. But the objection is not well\r\ntaken. The climatic conditions which obtain about the borders of small,\r\nlocal glaciers, are not a safe guide as to climatic conditions which\r\nobtained about the margin of a continental ice-sheet, any more than the\r\nclimatic conditions which obtain about a small inland lake are a safe\r\ncriterion as to the climatic conditions about a sea-coast. The general\r\nprinciples of climatology, as well as specific facts concerning plant\r\ndistribution, seem to us to indicate that the climate about the border\r\nof a continental ice-sheet must have been arctic.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the greater the distance north of the overlying\r\ndrift remains of temperate plants are found, the more conclusive\r\nbecomes the evidence. Plant remains indicating temperate climate at\r\nthe very margin of the drift sheet which overlies them, would be less\r\nconclusive than similar evidences one hundred miles to the northward.\r\nIt might be difficult to prove in any given instance that the ice which\r\ndeposited the drift overlying plant remains advanced one hundred miles,\r\nor any other specific distance, south of any particular underlying\r\nforest bed. If the forest bed were continuous for the whole distance,\r\nthe case would be clear. It would also be conclusive if the continuity\r\nof the drift overlying a forest bed at any point with that of a\r\nremote point to the south, could be demonstrated. In spite of these\r\ndifficulties in its application, the vegetal beds constitute a valuable\r\ncriterion in making the discriminations under consideration, when they\r\nare properly applied. Under proper circumstances the criterion may be\r\nconclusive when taken alone, and it may have corroborative significance\r\nwhen not itself conclusive.\r\n\r\nThe absence of forest beds and of all traces of vegetal deposits\r\nwhatsoever between beds of drift, is no proof of the absence of\r\nrecurrent ice epochs, since the second advance of the ice might have\r\ndestroyed all trace of the preëxistent soil and its vegetal life. It\r\nis always possible, too, that such beds exist, even if they have not\r\nbeen discovered. It would have been anticipated that they would not be\r\nabundant, or wide spread. The absence of forest beds is therefore at\r\nbest no more than negative evidence.\r\n\r\n(2) _Remains of Land Animals._ Bones of mammalia or remains of other\r\nland animals, occurring in relations similar to those in which forest\r\nbeds occur, may have a like significance. Their value as a criterion of\r\nseparate glacial epochs is subject to essentially the same limitations\r\nas forest beds.\r\n\r\n(3) _Inorganic Products formed during a time of Ice Recession._\r\nThe recession of the ice after a maximum of advance would leave\r\na land surface more or less affected with marshes and ponds. In\r\nsuch situations, bog iron ore might accumulate, if conditions were\r\nfavorable. Such ore beds, buried by the drift of a later ice advance,\r\nwould have a significance comparable to that of forest beds, except\r\nthat they would give less definite information as to climate, and would\r\nbe correspondingly less trustworthy. Should such ore beds be found in\r\nsuch relations as to prove that the underlying and overlying bodies\r\nof drift were deposited by ice sheets which extended great distances\r\nfurther south, their significance would be enhanced. From the thickness\r\nof the ore beds some inference might be drawn as to the length of time\r\nconcerned in their accumulation. But because of the variable rate\r\nat which bog ore may accumulate, such inference should be used with\r\ncaution.\r\n\r\nConcretions of iron oxide might be formed in the marshes or in\r\nill-drained drift areas where accumulations of greater extent were\r\nnot made. A subsequent incursion of the ice might incorporate these\r\nnodules with its drift, wearing and striating them as other stones,\r\nand depositing them as constituent parts of the later drift. Such\r\niron nodules in the later drift would mean a recession and re-advance\r\nof the ice with some considerable interval between, although not\r\nnecessarily an interval sufficiently warm or long to be regarded as\r\nan interglacial epoch.[15] Calcareous concretions, like those of the\r\nloess, would possess a like significance, in like relations. While in\r\nthemselves these inorganic products of a time of ice recession might\r\nfail to be conclusive of separate ice epochs, they might have much\r\ncorroborative significance when associated with other phenomena. An\r\ninter-till iron ore bed, associated with a forest bed which indicated a\r\nwarm climate, would be most significant.\r\n\r\n[15] This point concerning iron nodules was suggested to the writer by\r\nMr. W. J. McGee.\r\n\r\nThe absence of knowledge of ore beds between sheets of till, and the\r\nabsence from an upper bed of till of concretions of iron and lime\r\ncarbonate formed during a recession of the ice, would be no proof that\r\ninterglacial epochs did not occur. These products were probably formed\r\nin relatively few localities. They stood good chance of destruction at\r\nthe hands of the returning ice, and they may exist, where they have not\r\nbeen discovered, or where their significance has not been understood.\r\nTheir absence is at best no more than negative evidence.\r\n\r\n(4) _Beds of Marine and Lacustrine Origin._ If between beds of glacial\r\ndrift there be found beds of lacustrine or of marine origin, such beds\r\nwould indicate a recession of the ice during their time of deposition.\r\nTheir position would be a minimum measure of ice recession. If such\r\nlacustrine beds contain organic remains, they will bear testimony\r\nconcerning the climatic conditions which existed where they occur,\r\nat the time of their deposition. If the fossils in such beds denote\r\na temperate climate, or a climate as mild as that of the present day\r\nin the same region, the ice must have receded so far to the northward\r\nas, in our judgment, to constitute its re-advance a distinct ice\r\nepoch. This line of argument may be even stronger than that drawn\r\nfrom remains of terrestrial life, since the ice would probably affect\r\nthe temperature of the sea to greater distances than that of the\r\nland, and affect it to a greater degree within a given distance. The\r\nargument becomes stronger the further north the inter-drift marine and\r\nlacustrine deposits occur, since the ice must always have receded to\r\na position still further north. If marine or lacustrine beds lying far\r\nnorth of the later ice limit contain proof of temperate climate, the\r\nargument becomes conclusive.\r\n\r\nThe absence of marine and lacustrine deposits between beds of drift,\r\nwould be no proof that interglacial epochs did not occur. Lacustrine\r\nbeds could be made only where there were lakes, and lakes would be the\r\nexception rather than the rule. Marine beds in similar positions would\r\nrarely be known, except where a definite succession of changes of level\r\nhas taken place. Both classes of deposits, if once formed, would be\r\nsubject to destruction by the over-riding ice of a later epoch, if such\r\nthere were. Neither would be likely to be preserved at all points where\r\nformed, and both may exist at many points where their existence is\r\nnot known. The absence of these beds is at best no more than negative\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\n(5) _Beds of Subaërial Gravel, Sand and Silt._ Layers of stratified\r\ndrift between layers of ground moraine are of common occurrence in many\r\nregions. Under ordinary conditions their existence is not regarded as\r\nevidence that the underlying and overlying tills are to be referred\r\nto separate ice epochs. But it is conceivable that beds of stratified\r\ndrift may, under the proper circumstances and relations, be strong\r\nevidence of separate ice epochs. The last stages of ice work in the\r\nglacial period were accompanied, in many regions, by the deposition\r\nupon adjacent land surfaces, of extensive bodies of gravel and sand,\r\nwashed on beyond the ice by waters issuing from it. Except in valleys\r\nthrough which strong currents coursed, such deposits were apparently\r\nnot carried far beyond the edge of the ice. But as the edge of the ice\r\nwithdrew to the northward, sand plains may have extended themselves\r\nin the same direction, by additions to their ice-ward faces. It is\r\nconceivable that the process of subaërial plain building at the edge\r\nof a receding phase of ice, might be carried so far under favorable\r\ncircumstances, as to result in the construction of plains of great\r\nextent. In this event, a subsequent ice-advance might overspread\r\nsuch plains in such wise as to bury, without destroying them, though\r\nsuch a course of events would certainly be exceptional. In order to\r\nconstitute the interstratified gravel and sand evidence of separate\r\nice-epochs, its continuity for great distances between beds of till,\r\nand in the direction of ice movement, would need to be demonstrated.\r\nIn themselves, these beds, under the conditions indicated, would\r\nsimply be a minimum measure of the amount of ice recession between\r\nthe deposition of the underlying and overlying bodies of till. It is\r\nhardly likely, though possible, that the continuity of interbedded\r\ngravel and sand could be proved for a sufficient distance north of the\r\nsouthern limit of the less extensive bed of ground moraine, to alone\r\nconstitute evidence of a recession of ice great enough to make it\r\nnecessary to refer its re-advance to a new epoch. Beds of silt in like\r\nrelations, deposited by waters beyond the edge of the ice, would have\r\na like significance so far as the question here under consideration\r\nis concerned. Such beds of stratified drift might sometimes have\r\ncorroborative value when their testimony, taken by itself, is\r\ninconclusive. If, for example, their surfaces are marked by forest\r\nbeds, and especially by forest beds whose plants denote a warm climate,\r\nthe association becomes most significant.\r\n\r\nIn view of what has been said, it is evident that the absence of beds\r\nof subaërially stratified silt, sand, and gravel, between beds of till\r\ncan not be brought in evidence against separate ice epochs. It would\r\nrarely be true that topographic and hydro-*graphic conditions would\r\nmake possible the construction of plains of sufficient extent to serve\r\nas criteria for the purpose here indicated, and few of those formed\r\nwould escape such a degree of destruction as to leave them demonstrably\r\ncontinuous. There is also the further possibility that such beds exist,\r\neven though their continuity be not known. To prove the continuity of\r\na buried bed of stratified and incoherent drift, even if it existed,\r\nwould be a most difficult task.\r\n\r\n(6) _Differential Weathering._ If, after covering a given region, the\r\nice retreated, the drift which it left in the area which it previously\r\ncovered would be subject to oxidation, leaching and disintegration.\r\nThe depth to which this oxidation, leaching and disintegration would\r\nextend, would be dependent upon the length of time during which the\r\ndrift was exposed, and upon the climate which affected the region\r\nduring its exposure. The longer the exposure and the warmer the\r\nclimate, the deeper would the weathering extend. If, subsequently,\r\nthe ice extended over the same region, it might, in some places,\r\noverride and bury the old surface without destroying it. The earlier\r\noxidized and leached drift would thus come to be buried by the newer,\r\nunoxidized, unleached drift. If, therefore, beneath the newer drift\r\nof any given locality there be found a lower drift, the surface of\r\nwhich is oxidized and leached to a considerable depth, the evidence\r\nis strong that the lower drift was exposed for a long period of time\r\nbefore the upper drift was deposited upon it. Within certain limits a\r\nsimilar result might be brought about, it is true, if the ice, after\r\nhaving reached a certain maximum stage of advance, were to retreat for\r\na short distance only and there remain for a very long period of time.\r\nA subsequent minor advance might bury the oxidized surface of the drift\r\nbeyond the position of the long ice-halt. Under these conditions, the\r\nclimate which would have obtained in the area of the drift exposed\r\nduring the minor retreat would have been cold, and oxidation, leaching,\r\nand disintegration would have proceeded slowly. If they reached\r\nconsiderable depths, the time involved must have been very long. If\r\nthis surface of oxidized and leached and disintegrated drift were found\r\nto reach far to the northward beneath the layer of newer and upper\r\ndrift, it would indicate a great recession of the ice. We maintain that\r\nif it were found sufficiently far north of the margin of the overlying\r\ndrift, and if its depth were sufficiently great, extending well down\r\nbelow any possible accumulation of superglacial till, it might be a\r\npositive criterion of so great a recession of the ice, protracted\r\nthrough so great an interval of time, as to constitute its new advance\r\na separate ice epoch.\r\n\r\nThere is much reason to believe that the soil developed under the\r\ninfluence of a warm climate differs in some respects from one developed\r\nfrom similar material under other conditions. The well-known fact that\r\nred and reddish soils are especially characteristic of low latitudes\r\nand warm climates is significant. If therefore a soil developed on\r\nthe surface of one sheet of drift and buried by another, be found\r\nto possess, in addition to unmistakable marks of long exposure, the\r\npeculiar marks which seem to be characteristic of soils developed under\r\nhigh temperatures, the argument gains in strength.\r\n\r\nThis argument from oxidation and weathering has another application.\r\nIf in a later advance, following a protracted recession, the ice-sheet\r\nfailed to reach the limit of its earlier advance, there would remain\r\nan area of drift deposited by the first ice-sheet, outside the drift\r\ndeposited by the later. Now if the time interval between these two\r\nadvances was great, and especially if during this interval the climate\r\nwas mild, the oxidation and weathering of the older drift surface would\r\nbe markedly different in degree from that of the newer. If, under\r\nthese circumstances, the surface of the older sheet were found to be\r\nweathered and oxidized and reddened up to the border of the newer\r\ndrift sheet, and if here there were found to be a sudden change in\r\nthe character of the surface of the drift so far as depth and degree\r\nof oxidization and weathering is concerned, we should have strong\r\nevidence that the one sheet of drift was much older than the other.\r\nThe statement sometimes urged that the drift which was deposited near\r\nthe edge of the greatest ice advance would be largely made up of the\r\nresidual materials which occupied the surface invaded by the ice,\r\nwould not meet the case. For if it be granted that this statement is\r\nqualitatively good, we should find the greatest degree of weathering\r\nand oxidation at the extreme margin of the drift, and it should be\r\nfound to be less and less on receding from this margin. There would in\r\nthis case be no sudden transition from a deeply weathered and oxidized\r\nsurface, to one which is fresh and unoxidized, along a definite line.\r\nWe maintain that if the whole of the drift deposits are referable to\r\none epoch, there should be no sudden transition in the surface of the\r\ndrift from that which is deeply weathered to that which is not, the\r\none surface being separated from the other by a definite and readily\r\ntraceable line.\r\n\r\nIt has been urged against the criterion of differential weathering\r\nthat superglacial material is or may be thoroughly oxidized before\r\nits deposition, and that a layer of oxidized drift between layers of\r\ntill may be no more than superglacial debris deposited during a minor\r\nrecession of the ice.[16] We believe that this attempt to eliminate\r\nthe value of this criterion rests partly on an exaggerated idea\r\nconcerning the amount of superglacial material, but more especially\r\non a failure to apprehend the real meaning of the argument for the\r\nvalidity of the criterion, and upon a failure to note the limitations\r\nimposed upon it by its advocates. It is not affirmed that a layer of\r\noxidized drift between beds of unoxidized drift is _per se_ proof of\r\ntwo glacial epochs; but it is affirmed that if such layer of weathered\r\ndrift can be shown to extend far below any possible superglacial till,\r\ninto the subglacial till below, in such wise as to indicate that it\r\nis the result of subaërial exposure in a warm climate subsequent to\r\nits deposition and prior to the deposition of the overlying till,\r\nit constitutes the best possible evidence of an interglacial epoch,\r\nespecially when accompanied by the corroborative testimony of other\r\ncriteria. It is further affirmed that if the second sheet of drift\r\nfailed to reach the limit of the first, and if the drift which was\r\ndeposited by the first and never covered by the second ice-sheet, is\r\nmore thoroughly and more deeply weathered than that deposited by the\r\nsecond, and especially if the two types of drift surface meet along\r\na definite and readily traceable line, the argument becomes, in our\r\njudgment, irrefragable. In its application, this criterion would be\r\ninfallible only in the hands of one who could distinguish between\r\nsuperglacial and superglacially oxidized material on the one hand, and\r\nmaterial subaërially weathered after its deposition, on the other.\r\n\r\n[16] This point was urged at the reading of the paper at Ottawa, by\r\nProf. C. H. Hitchcock, Mr. Upham, and others.\r\n\r\nIn circumstances and relations where the weathering of the drift is\r\nnot in itself conclusive, it might still have corroborative value in\r\nassociation with other lines of evidence.\r\n\r\nThe absence of an oxidized and disintegrated zone of drift below a\r\nsuperficial layer which is not oxidized, would be no proof that there\r\nwere not distinct ice epochs, since the ice of any later epoch, if such\r\nthere were, might have planed off the surface of the drift left by its\r\npredecessor to the depth of the weathering. The preservation of such\r\nsurfaces after a second ice invasion must be regarded as the exception\r\nrather than as the rule. There is always the possibility, too, that\r\nan oxidized and weathered zone marking the surface of an older drift\r\nsheet exists, where excavations have not opened full sections of drift\r\nto view. The absence of weathered zones of drift beneath the surface,\r\nor the absence of knowledge of their existence, is therefore at best\r\nno more than negative evidence. The absence of greater weathering of\r\nthe drift outside the limit of the drift supposed to belong to a later\r\nepoch, would be positive evidence against the reference of the two\r\nsheets of drift concerned to different epochs.\r\n\r\nA specific part of the above line of evidence may be separately\r\nmentioned. One phase of weathering is the disintegration of boulders,\r\nand this is a point which can be readily applied even by those who are\r\nnot geologists. If the boulders of one region are much more commonly\r\ndisintegrated than those of another, and if the two regions are\r\nseparated from each other by a well-marked boundary line, the inference\r\nlies close at hand that the boulders in the one case have been much\r\nlonger exposed to disintegrating agencies than in the other. It is\r\nno answer to this argument to say that the materials lying at the\r\nvery front of the drift deposits contain boulders which were derived\r\nfrom the disintegrated rock over which the ice has passed, and that\r\nthey were therefore in a less firm state at the outset. In many cases\r\nthese boulders have come from great distances, and coming from great\r\ndistances they must have come in a firm and solid state, else they\r\ncould not have suffered such extensive transportation, except indeed\r\ntheir position was superglacial throughout their whole journey. This\r\nargument has equal force when applied to the area covered by the two\r\nsheets of drift where two exist. If within the region of drift under\r\ninvestigation we find a surface layer of greater or less depth,\r\nthe boulders of which are hard and fresh, and if beneath this we\r\nfind another layer of drift, the stony material of which is largely\r\ndisintegrated, at least in its upper parts, we have good evidence\r\nthat the surface bearing the disintegrated boulders was exposed for\r\na considerable length of time before the deposition of the overlying\r\ndrift, which carries fresh boulders. Since the disintegration of\r\nboulders is only one phase of weathering, the limitations of this\r\nargument are identical with those already noted in connection with the\r\ngeneral argument from differential weathering.\r\n\r\n(7) _Differential Subaërial Erosion._ If the drift deposited by one\r\nice-sheet were to be exposed for a considerable interval of time, and\r\nif the ice in its subsequent advance failed to reach the limit of\r\nits first invasion, the two areas should show different amounts of\r\nsubaërial erosion, since the one has been exposed to the action of air\r\nand water much longer than the other. The line which marks the limit\r\nof the later ice invasion should be the line of more or less sudden\r\ntransition from an area without, where stream erosion has been greater,\r\nto an area within, where stream erosion has been less.\r\n\r\nThe point here made can not be met by the suggestion that the greater\r\nerosion of the outer area was effected by the water issuing from the\r\nice which had retreated to the position now marked by the border of the\r\narea of the lesser erosion. So far as we know, such waters would be\r\ndepositing, not eroding. Furthermore, much of the erosion of the outer\r\narea would have such relation to drainage lines that waters issuing\r\nfrom the ice could never have reached the localities where it is shown.\r\n\r\nIf the outer and older drift be found to have suffered ten times as\r\nmuch stream erosion as the inner and newer, it is fair to assume that\r\nit has been exposed something like ten times as long, if the conditions\r\nfor erosion are equally favorable in the two regions. The argument has\r\nespecial weight if it can be found that beneath the newer drift the\r\nsurface of the older is such as to indicate that it was deeply eroded\r\nbefore the newer was placed upon it. The argument is stronger the\r\nfarther from the margin of the newer drift such erosion on the surface\r\nof the underlying older drift can be proved to have taken place. In\r\nother words, if, in addition to the greater surface erosion of the\r\nolder drift sheet as now exposed outside the limit of the newer drift,\r\nwe find a notable unconformity between the newer and the older drift,\r\nand especially if this unconformity lie far enough north of the margin\r\nof the newer drift, the argument becomes conclusive.\r\n\r\nWhen differential erosion and drift unconformities are not in\r\nthemselves conclusive, they may have great corroborative value in\r\nconjunction with differential weathering, forest beds, or other\r\nindications of separate ice epochs.\r\n\r\nThe absence of observable unconformity between sheets of drift would\r\nbe no proof that there were not distinct and widely separated ice\r\nepochs, since the later ice invasion might have so far modified the\r\nsurface which it transgressed, as to destroy all patent evidences\r\nof unconformity. It would have been anticipated that distinct\r\nunconformities in the drift would be rare, even if there were distinct\r\nice epochs, for the same reason that weathered zones and forest beds\r\nwould be rare. But if the drift which lies outside a line supposed to\r\nmark the limit of a sheet of drift belonging to a later ice epoch, be\r\nnot more eroded than that which lies within such line, the absence of\r\ngreater erosion in the outer drift is positive evidence against the\r\nreference of the drift of the two areas to distinct ice epochs, if\r\nconditions for erosion in the two areas are equally favorable.\r\n\r\n(8) _Valleys Excavated Between Successive Depositions of Drift._ A\r\nclosely related, but not identical, point may be found in the extent of\r\nthe valley excavations which can be proved to have taken place between\r\nthe deposition of the earlier and later drift. We do not refer to\r\nvalleys excavated in the drift especially, but to those excavated in\r\nother formations as well. If it can be shown, for example, that after\r\nthe deposition of an earlier drift sheet, and before the deposition\r\nof a later, valleys were excavated which extended not merely into the\r\ndrift itself, but far beneath the drift into the underlying rock,\r\nthese valleys would be conclusive evidence of a long interval between\r\nthe deposition of the two bodies of drift. The argument is of especial\r\nforce when such excavations in the rock beneath the drift can be shown\r\nto have taken place at great distances within the margin of the newer\r\ndrift. For valleys in such situations imply that the ice had receded at\r\nleast as far to the north as they lie, during the interval between the\r\ntwo drift depositions, and may be so situated as to show that the ice\r\nhad wholly left the drainage basin where they occur.\r\n\r\nThe absence of evidences of deep valley excavations in any given region\r\nduring a supposed interglacial epoch, is no proof that such interval\r\ndid not exist. The conditions may not have been everywhere favorable\r\nfor erosion within the limits of any narrowly circumscribed area, and\r\nthe absence of interglacial valleys would be only negative evidence\r\nagainst an interglacial epoch. The absence of such evidence everywhere\r\nwould bear against the existence of an interglacial epoch of much\r\nduration in such wise as to be more than negative evidence.\r\n\r\n(9) _Different Directions of Movement._ If, after its maximum advance,\r\nthe ice suffered merely a minor recession and then remained stationary,\r\nor nearly so, for a time, the general direction of its movement in a\r\nsubsequent advance would probably be essentially the same as in the\r\nearlier. But if, after its maximum advance, the ice receded to a great\r\ndistance, and especially if it entirely disappeared, a subsequent\r\nice-sheet might have a very different direction of movement, since\r\nits center of accumulation and dispersion might be very different.\r\nIt is conceivable that this center might shift during the history of\r\na single ice-sheet. In this case there should be a gradual change in\r\nthe direction of ice movement, not an abrupt one. If, therefore, there\r\nbe found one sheet of drift made by an ice movement in one direction,\r\noverlaid by another sheet of drift deposited by ice moving in a very\r\ndifferent direction, with an abrupt transition between them, such\r\ndrift sheets would be presumptive evidence of distinct ice epochs. An\r\nexception would need to be made in the case of drift sheets along the\r\nmargins of confluent or proximate ice lobes. In such cases, if the\r\none lobe temporarily secured the advantage of the other, drift beds\r\nformed by movements from opposite directions might be found in vertical\r\nsuccession, without being evidence of separate ice epochs.\r\n\r\nIt is no part of the purpose of this essay to point out the\r\ndifficulties which might arise in the application of this criterion\r\nof diverse directions of ice movements. It is possible that gradual\r\nchanges in the direction of movement might leave records which would\r\nseem to indicate abrupt changes instead. This possibility makes care\r\nnecessary in the application of the criterion, but does not destroy its\r\nvalue. When not itself conclusive, this criterion may be so associated\r\nwith differential weathering, differential erosion, forest beds, etc.,\r\nthat their combined testimony makes but one conclusion possible.\r\n\r\nThe absence of evidence of radically diverse directions of movement\r\nduring the time of deposition of the various sheets of drift, would\r\nbe no proof that there were not distinct epochs. In the first place,\r\nthe movements of different epochs might be harmonious--a condition of\r\nthings more probable than any other if the more common views of the\r\ncauses of glaciation be correct. In the second place, if the movements\r\nwere diverse, the deposits might still be so similar that their\r\ndifferentiation, when the one is buried, might not be easily made. In\r\nthe third place, the later ice might have so far incorporated the older\r\ndrift material with that which belonged more properly to it, as to have\r\ndestroyed all definition between them.\r\n\r\n(10) _The Superposition of Beds of Till of Different Physical\r\nConstitution._ After the retreat of an ice-sheet, the surface of the\r\ncountry thus discovered would be largely mantled with drift. This drift\r\nwould serve to protect the underlying rock from disintegration. But\r\nwhere there was little or no drift, the rock surface would be subject\r\nto all the disrupting agencies which affect surface rocks. The same\r\nwould be true of all rock surfaces bared by subaërial erosion after the\r\ndisappearance of the ice. Under these conditions, if a second sheet\r\nof ice invaded the region in question after it had been long exposed,\r\nit would find a surface prepared to yield large bowlders. The result\r\nwould be the deposition of a new sheet of drift containing bowlders\r\nmuch larger than those which would have been proper to an ice-sheet\r\noverspreading a surface but recently abandoned. If, therefore, in\r\nthe upper of two layers of subglacial till, bowlders of great size\r\npredominate, as compared with those of a lower homologous layer, they\r\nmay be indicative of a great interval of time between the deposition\r\nof the upper and lower beds of drift. If the home of these bowlders\r\nbe far north of the limit of the lesser sheet of drift, the distance,\r\nas well as the duration, of the ice retreat must have been great, and\r\nthe reference of the two beds of till to distinct ice epochs would be\r\nfavored. The case might be so strong as to make no other interpretation\r\npossible. Where in itself inconclusive, this criterion would have\r\ncorroborative significance. In its application, the discrimination of\r\nsubglacial and superglacial till would be imperative.\r\n\r\nThe absence of physical dissimilarity between superposed layers of\r\nsubglacial till would not be proof of the absence of separate glacial\r\nepochs. The phenomena constituting the criterion could hardly be\r\nexpected to be of common occurrence. They would never be obtrusive, and\r\nmay easily have escaped attention where they exist.[17]\r\n\r\n[17] The 10th criterion, in the order here named, was suggested by Mr.\r\nMcGee in the discussion which followed the reading of the paper at\r\nOttawa.\r\n\r\n(11) _Varying Altitudes and Attitudes of the Land._ Another line of\r\nargument has to do with the altitude and attitude of the land during\r\nthe deposition of various members of the drift complex. If during\r\nthe deposition of one part of the drift that part of the continent\r\ncovered by the outer part of the ice was low, the drainage from it\r\nwould be sluggish. If the deposits of this drainage persist to the\r\npresent time, we may find in their character evidence of the nature\r\nof the drainage, and therefore of the attitude of the land. If at a\r\nlater time of drift deposition the glacial drainage in the same region\r\nwas more vigorous, the deposits made by the glacial streams would be\r\ncorrespondingly coarser. In these deposits, if they persist to the\r\npresent day, we should find conclusive evidence of the swiftness of the\r\nstreams. If it can be shown that during the deposition of one sheet of\r\ndrift drainage was sluggish, and that during the deposition of a later\r\nbody of drift the drainage was vigorous, these facts are evidence of an\r\ninterval between the two times of drift deposition, sufficiently long\r\nto accomplish the corresponding changes in elevation or attitude. Since\r\nsuch changes of altitude and attitude are generally believed to have\r\nbeen accomplished slowly, the interval must be believed to have been of\r\nconsiderable duration.\r\n\r\nIt is true that continental altitudes and attitudes might change during\r\na single epoch of glaciation. If the change thus brought about resulted\r\nin increased slope, the more sluggish drainage of the earlier part\r\nof the epoch would be gradually transformed into the more vigorous\r\ndrainage of the later part. In this case, if the evidence of both the\r\nearlier sluggish drainage and of the later vigorous drainage remain,\r\nthere should also remain the evidence of the intermediate stages. If\r\nthe deposits representing the intermediate condition of drainage do not\r\nexist, while those representing both extremes do, there would be the\r\nbest of reason for believing that the intermediate phases of drainage\r\ndid not exist during a glacial epoch, but during an interglacial\r\nepoch, when streams were not handling glacial debris, and when they\r\nwere eroding rather than depositing. The deposits of the slow and of\r\nthe swift drainage might occur in such relations as to prove, beyond\r\nperadventure, that intermediate stages of _glacial_ drainage never\r\nexisted.\r\n\r\nIf the sluggish drainage accompanied the maximum ice invasion, while\r\nthe vigorous accompanied a lesser, the evidence of the swift streams\r\nmight be found far north of the southern limit of the earlier drift.\r\nThe farther north of the outer border of the older drift the gravel\r\nrepresenting the vigorous drainage of the later and minor ice-sheet\r\noccurs, the further the ice must have retreated before the change from\r\nthe one type of drainage to the other was effected. On the other\r\nhand, the farther north of the limit of the later ice advance the\r\nsluggish drainage accompanying the earlier ice-sheet may be traced,\r\nthe farther must the ice have receded before the changes resulting in\r\nvigorous drainage occurred. Under certain relations, the retreat of the\r\nice might be shown to have been great enough, before the orographic\r\nmovements which altered the nature of the drainage, to constitute\r\nin our judgment, a re-advance a distinct ice epoch. If for example\r\nthroughout the course of a long river whose basin was largely covered\r\nwith ice, there be evidence that sluggish drainage obtained during the\r\nmaximum ice advance, and during all stages of the ice retreat until the\r\nbasin was free from ice, and if there be evidence of a vigorous glacial\r\ndrainage in the same valley at a later time, with no gradations between\r\nthe two types, we have proof positive of at least a great recession,\r\nand of a considerable elevation of the land after the ice had receded\r\nbeyond the limits of the drainage basin and before it again reached\r\nit in its re-advance. We hold that these phases of glacial drainage\r\ndeposits may be so related to each other, to the valleys in which\r\nthey occur, and to more or less distinct bodies of glacier drift, as\r\nto prove so great a recession of ice between the diverse phases of\r\ndrainage deposition, as to constitute the second advance a distinct ice\r\nepoch.\r\n\r\nThe absence of evidence that the land stood at different elevations\r\nduring different parts of the period of drift deposition, does not\r\nin any way militate against the theory of recurrent and distinct ice\r\nepochs. A constant attitude of the land is the thing to be assumed,\r\nuntil positive evidence to the contrary is adduced.\r\n\r\n(12) _Vigor and Sluggishness of Ice Action._ If it can be shown that\r\nduring one epoch of glaciation, we will say the epoch of maximum ice\r\nextension, the ice action was relatively sluggish, while during a later\r\nand minor advance its action was vigorous, the difference of action\r\nmight be regarded as presumptive evidence of distinct ice epochs.\r\nEvidence of the two phases of ice action here referred to are difficult\r\nof definition, but they have been independently noted by more than\r\none glacialist. It is true that a forward oscillation of the ice edge\r\nmight be more forceful than an earlier forward movement which might\r\nhave reached a greater extension. In itself, therefore, this line of\r\nevidence can not be regarded as possessing great value.\r\n\r\nIt has been indicated that under certain circumstances, and in certain\r\nrelations, some of the foregoing criteria, taken singly, may be\r\nconclusive of glaciations so distinct from each other, as to make their\r\nreference to separate epochs proper. But where the facts and relations\r\nwhich constitute one of the criteria are found, the facts and relations\r\nconstituting one or more of the others are likely to be found as\r\nwell. Where two of the foregoing criteria are found to be coexistent,\r\ntheir joint force is greater than that of either one. If neither one\r\nbe absolutely conclusive, the two may still be, since the one may\r\nexactly meet the deficiency of the other. If three or more concurrent\r\nlines of evidence exist in any locality, the case is still further\r\nstrengthened. We maintain that several of the foregoing criteria may be\r\nso related to each other and to the formations concerned, as not only\r\nto make the recognition of separate ice epochs proper, but to make the\r\nfailure of such recognition altogether unscientific. Even when a single\r\nline of evidence, or when double, or triple, or quadruple lines of\r\nevidence are not absolutely conclusive in ruling out every conceivable\r\ntechnical escape from the conclusion that there were separate ice\r\nepochs, their cumulative and corroborative force may still be such as\r\nto carry conviction scarcely less positive than that which mathematical\r\ndemonstration would afford. In the nature of the case not all of these\r\nvarious lines of evidence could be expected to be found in any one\r\nlocality, or perhaps in any one limited geographic area, but where one\r\noccurs, some or all of the others are liable to be found under favoring\r\ncircumstance. The number of criteria, and the great extent of area\r\nwhere they may hope for application, afford great possibilities.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing discussion, it will be readily seen that the nature\r\nof the criteria and the limitations imposed upon their application by\r\nthe difficulty of proving stratigraphic continuity in such a formation\r\nas the drift, necessitate the greatest care in their use, and reduce\r\nthe value of hasty and inexpert conclusions to a minimum.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. =Areas Where the Criteria find Readiest Application.=\r\n\r\nThe foregoing criteria find their readiest application in regions where\r\na later sheet of drift, suspected of belonging to a later ice epoch,\r\nfailed to reach the border of an earlier sheet of drift, suspected of\r\nbelonging to an earlier ice epoch. The 1st, 2d, 3d, 4th, 5th and 10th\r\nas enumerated above, find their application wholly within the area\r\naffected by the drift of the separate epochs, if such there were. While\r\nwithin this general area they may be looked for at any point, they\r\nare likely to be of rare occurrence, except along a somewhat narrow\r\nbelt, say 50 to 100 miles, adjacent to the border of the lesser ice\r\nadvance. The conditions for their occurrence and detection are greatly\r\nfavored if the lesser drift sheet be the later. The 6th, 7th, 9th and\r\n12th criteria might hope for application within the same belt, but\r\nespecially along a narrow zone on either side of the margin of the\r\nlater drift sheet. It is along this zone that the types of surface are\r\nthrown into sharpest contrast, both as to material and topography. The\r\n8th and 11th criteria have still wider limits of application, both\r\nwithin and without the border of the lesser ice advance.\r\n\r\n                                                 =Rollin D. Salisbury.=\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            =_Editorials._=\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is the chief function of the national, state and provincial\r\ngeological surveys to bring forth the great concrete facts relative\r\nto the structure and resources of their several fields. Within their\r\nspecial domains they also do an important work in the correlation\r\nof structures and formations, in the systematic aggregation of the\r\nfacts, in the organizing of results, and in the development of the\r\nfundamental principles of geological science. To some extent they are\r\npermitted to do this beyond their own fields, but in the main the\r\nboundaries of these fields are the limits of their coördinations. They\r\ntherefore leave a great function to be performed by some other agency\r\nin the coördination of interstate, international, and intercontinental\r\nfactors. They are also restrained by their relationships to a somewhat\r\ntoo narrowly utilitarian public from devoting much direct attention\r\nto the solution of the deeper and broader problems that constitute\r\nthe soul of science, though their contributions bear upon these in\r\nthe most radical and important way. In the primary work of systematic\r\nobservation, and the development of the immediate conclusions that\r\nspring therefrom, these surveys surpass all other agencies in the\r\nvalue of their contributions to the growth of the science, but in\r\nthe secondary and ulterior work of correlation, in the synthetic\r\naggregation and organization of results, and in the analytical and\r\nphilosophical treatment of the whole, they need to be supplemented\r\nby agencies whose facilities and limitations lie in other lines,\r\nagencies whose relations and dependencies are complementary in nature.\r\nThis secondary and ulterior work, in some degree, has been done by\r\nindividual master students of systematic and philosophical geology, but\r\nto a very great extent it has not been done at all. It is a function\r\nwhich properly falls to universities, if the universities can only rise\r\nto meet it; for it is the function of universities, in the larger\r\nmodern view, not only to rehearse science, nor merely even to educate\r\nyoung geologists, important as that is, but to develop science for\r\nscience's own sake, and for its own inherent and permanent utilities\r\nas distinguished from its immediate applicabilities. To fulfill this\r\nfunction they must not only realize and appreciate it, but they must\r\nbe equipped for field and experimental work, as well as library and\r\nlaboratory study. Ideal correlations and academic systematizing are as\r\napt to be hindrances as helps to the progress of science. While a few\r\nof the great universities of this country and Europe have made notable\r\nadvances in these directions, the universities are, on the whole, far\r\nbehind the great surveys in the performance of the work which properly\r\nfalls to them. This is due not so much to a lack of appreciation of the\r\nfunction as to the lack of facilities.\r\n\r\nWith the development of this higher function of the universities there\r\ngoes a coördinate function for a university journal of geology, a\r\njournal whose special efforts shall be devoted to promoting the growth\r\nof systematic, philosophical, and fundamental geology, and to the\r\neducation of professional geologists. No part of the wide domain can\r\nwisely be neglected by any journal, but there seems to be an open field\r\nfor a periodical which specially invites the discussion of systematic\r\nand fundamental themes, and of international and intercontinental\r\nrelations, and which in particular seeks to promote the study of\r\ngeographic and continental evolution, orographic movements, volcanic\r\ncoördinations and consanguinities, biological developments and\r\nmigrations, climatic changes, and similar questions of wide and\r\nfundamental interest. This field is not likely to be successfully\r\ncultivated except by a systematic endeavor, pursued through a period of\r\nyears, to bring together the latest and best summations of the results\r\nattained in the several national fields in a common medium, where they\r\ncan be compared and discussed, and where tentative correlations will\r\nsuggest themselves, out of which, in turn, working hypotheses will\r\nnaturally spring, leading on to such direct investigations as the\r\nnature of each question invites. It would be presumptuous to assume\r\nthat the =Journal of Geology= can cultivate with more than very partial\r\nsuccess this field, but it especially invites contributions of this\r\nclass.\r\n\r\nAnother phase of geology which is thought to stand in much need of\r\nactive cultivation is found in the clear and sharp analysis of its\r\nprocesses, the exhaustive classification of its phenomena, especially\r\non genetic bases, the development of criteria of discrimination, the\r\nmore complete evolution and formulation of its principles and the\r\ndevelopment of its working methods. The recent opening of new fields\r\nof research and the rapid progress of several new and important\r\ndepartments of the science give peculiar emphasis to this need. The\r\nrising generation of geologists, the hope of the science, should be\r\nschooled in these latest and most critical aspects of the science. A\r\ndepartment of the =Journal=, entitled \"Studies for Students,\" has been\r\nopened for the special cultivation of this field and for its adaptation\r\nto advanced students and progressive teachers of geology. Mere\r\nelementary presentations of processes and principles are not desired,\r\nbut searching and critical expositions are solicited suited to the\r\nneeds of young geologists who seek the highest professional equipment,\r\nand to progressive teachers who desire the fullest practicable command\r\nof the newest developments of the subject. These contributions may not\r\nbe without their value to those who have already borne a considerable\r\npart of the heat and burden of life's professional day.\r\n\r\nIt is our desire to open the pages of the =Journal= as broadly as a\r\ndue regard for merit will permit, and to free it as much as possible\r\nfrom local and institutional aspects. It will have the very important\r\nadvantage of being published under the auspices and guarantee of the\r\nUniversity of Chicago, and will be free from the usual financial\r\nembarrassments attending the publication of a scientific magazine. This\r\nnecessarily imposes upon the local editors the immediate responsibility\r\nfor its editorship. Beyond this, it is hoped that its institutional\r\nrelationship will disappear entirely in an earnest effort to promote\r\nthe widest interests of the science. As an earnest of this wider\r\neffort several eminent geologists, representing some of the leading\r\nuniversities of this country, and some of the great geological\r\norganizations of Europe, have kindly consented to act as associate\r\neditors.\r\n\r\n                                                               T. C. C.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nUpon invitation of the World's Congress Auxiliary of the World's\r\nColumbian Exposition committees were appointed by the several sections\r\nof the American Association for the Advancement of Science at its\r\nRochester meeting to coöperate with it in completing the organization\r\nof scientific congresses to be held at Chicago in connection with the\r\nforthcoming World's Fair. The committee appointed by the geological\r\nand geographical section consisted of Thomas C. Chamberlin, John C.\r\nBranner, Grove K. Gilbert, W. J. McGee, Rollin D. Salisbury, Eugene A.\r\nSmith, Charles D. Walcott, J. F. Whiteaves, Geo. H. Williams, H. S.\r\nWilliams and N. H. Winchell.\r\n\r\nIt has been arranged that this committee should undertake the work\r\nof preparing the scientific program for the Geological Congress. The\r\ncommittee have prepared a provisional schedule of topics, which they\r\nhave submitted to the Advisory Council for revision. It has seemed\r\nto the committee that all contributions should be such as to have an\r\ninternational interest. Preferably, they should be subjects that can\r\nonly be treated most advantageously in such a congress, especially\r\nthose that involve the bringing together of data from different lands\r\nfor comparison. The committee suggest the organization of the subjects\r\nunder the following general classes:\r\n\r\n=First.= Such as shall show the present state of geological progress.\r\nIt is believed that this can best be done by an exhibition of\r\ngeological maps which shall show the latest and best results of\r\nofficial and other surveys. As such maps will be prepared, it is hoped,\r\nfor the World's Fair, duplicates can be made at a slight expense for\r\nthe use of the Congress. It is hoped that each country that has made\r\nany notable progress in mapping its geological formations will furnish\r\nfor the Congress at least a general geological map, if not also special\r\nor analytical maps.\r\n\r\n=Second.= Such subjects as bear upon continental growth and\r\nintercontinental relations. It is proposed to make this a leading\r\nline of discussion during the Congress, in the belief that there is\r\nno subject more appropriate, and that there is none which better\r\nrepresents the present efforts of geologists or commands a more\r\ngeneral interest. It is hoped that analytical maps will be prepared\r\nby the geologists of the several countries representing the stages of\r\ngrowth of these regions in each of the great eras from the Archean\r\nto the Pleistocene, and that such analytical maps may constitute a\r\nleading feature of the several presentations. Among the subjects upon\r\nwhich contributions are specially invited are the following: The\r\ncorrelation of continental and intercontinental orographic movements\r\nand geographic accretions by sedimentation; The coördination of periods\r\nof vulcanism in the different countries; The coördination of climatic\r\nstates and changes; The correlation of faunal and floral variations\r\nand migrations. It is hoped that one session may be devoted to such\r\ncoördination papers bearing upon each of the great subdivisions: viz.,\r\nArchean, Paleozoic, Mesozoic, Cenozoic, and Pleistocene.\r\n\r\n=Third.= Papers on Paleontological and Archeological Geology of\r\ninternational scope.\r\n\r\n=Fourth.= Contributions to Physical, Structural and Petrological\r\nGeology having international or general bearings.\r\n\r\n=Fifth.= Contributions to Economic Geology having general bearings.\r\n\r\n=Sixth.= Miscellaneous papers of especial and general interest.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing groups are intended to embrace and coördinate the list of\r\nspecial themes announced in the circular issued by the local committee\r\nsome months since, except such as may be best suited to popular\r\npresentation, for which special provision is to be made.\r\n\r\nIt will be determined later, when the number and nature of the papers\r\nare ascertained, whether all will be arranged so as to form a\r\ncontinuous program, or whether sub-sections will be formed and two or\r\nmore sessions held simultaneously.\r\n\r\nIt is the desire of the World's Congress Auxiliary that a few addresses\r\nof a popular nature shall be given, with a view to stimulating an\r\ninterest in the development of the science on the part of the public.\r\n\r\n                                                               T.

(No. 9), 1892, pp. 127-149 (with a map).\r\n\r\nIn this timely essay Prof. Geikie reaches the following conclusions:\r\n\r\n1. The record of the first glacial epoch is found in the Weyborn Crag\r\nof Britain, and the ground moraine beneath the \"Lower Diluvium\" of the\r\ncontinent. During this epoch, the direction of the ice movement in\r\nsouthern Sweden was from the south-east to the northwest. This first\r\nglacial epoch of which direct evidence is adduced was followed by an\r\ninterglacial interval, during which the forest-bed of Cromer, the\r\nbreccia of Hötting, the lignites of Leffe and Pianico, and certain beds\r\nin central France were deposited. During this interglacial epoch, the\r\nclimate is believed to have been very mild.\r\n\r\n2. There followed a second epoch of glaciation, when the ice sheet of\r\nBritain became confluent with that of the continent. This was the epoch\r\nduring which the ice sheet reached its southernmost extension. Its\r\ndepositions are found in the lower boulder clays of Britain, the lower\r\ndiluvium of Scandinavia and north Germany (in part), the lower glacial\r\ndeposits of south Germany and central Russia, the ground moraines and\r\nhigh level gravel terraces of Alpine lands, and the terminal moraines\r\nof the outer zone. During this second glacial epoch, Alpine glaciers\r\nare believed to have attained their greatest development. This epoch\r\nof extreme glaciation was followed by an interglacial interval, during\r\nwhich Britain is believed to have been joined to the continent. During\r\nthis interval, the climate became temperate. In Russia (near Moscow)\r\nthere seems to be evidence that it was milder and more humid than that\r\nof the same region at the present day. Toward the close of the mild\r\nepoch, submergence seems to have been accompanied by an increasing\r\ndegree of cold, which finally ended in another glacial epoch.\r\n\r\n3. The subsidence which marked the close of the second interglacial\r\ninterval, marked likewise the inauguration of the third glacial\r\nepoch. Its work is represented in Britain by the upper boulder clay,\r\nin Scandinavia and Germany by the lower diluvium (in part), in central\r\nRussia by the upper glacial series, in Alpine lands by ground moraines\r\nand gravel terraces. The ice sheets of Scandinavia and Britain were\r\nagain confluent, but did not extend quite so far south as during the\r\nsecond glacial epoch. This third glacial epoch is believed to have\r\nbeen followed by another interglacial interval, during which fresh\r\nwater alluvia, lignite and peat accumulations were made. These are\r\nrepresented by the interglacial beds of north Germany, and by some\r\nof the so-called post-glacial alluvia of Britain. There were also\r\nmarine deposits on the coasts of Britain and on the borders of the\r\nBaltic. During this interglacial interval, Britain is believed to\r\nhave been continental. The climate was temperate, but in the course\r\nof time became more severe. This increasing severity seems to have\r\nbeen accompanied by submergence, which amounted to something like 100\r\nft. below the present sea-level on the coasts of Scotland. The Baltic\r\nprovinces of Germany were also invaded by the waters of the North Sea.\r\n\r\n4. There followed a fourth period of glaciation, during which the major\r\npart of the Scottish Highland was covered by an ice sheet. Local ice\r\nsheets existed in the southern uplands of Scotland and in mountain\r\ndistricts in other parts of Britain, and the great valley glaciers\r\nsometimes coalesced on the low lands. Icebergs floated out at the\r\nmouths of some of the highland sea-lochs. In some places, terminal\r\nmoraines were deposited upon marine beds which were then in process of\r\nformation. These beds are now 100 ft. above the sea level. At this time\r\nScandinavia was covered by a great ice sheet, which yielded icebergs\r\nto the sea along the whole west coast of Norway. The ground moraines\r\nand terminal moraines of the mountain regions of Britain represent the\r\ndeposits of this ice epoch. The upper diluvium of Scandinavia, Finland,\r\nand north Germany represent the work of the contemporaneous, but not\r\nconfluent, ice sheet of the continent. In the Alps, terminal moraines\r\nin the large longitudinal valleys were made at the same time.\r\n\r\nThis fourth glacial epoch was followed by a fourth interglacial\r\ninterval, during which fresh water alluvial deposits were made, and\r\nalso the \"lower buried forest and peat\" of Britain and northwestern\r\nEurope. At this time, Scotland seems to have stood 45 to 50 feet lower\r\nthan now, and Carse clays and raised beaches represent the work of the\r\nsea. During this interglacial interval, Britain is believed to have\r\nbecome again continental, while the climate became so far ameliorated\r\nas to allow the growth of great forests. Subsequently the insulation\r\nof Britain was effected, and this was followed by a climate which was\r\nprobably colder than the present.\r\n\r\n5. The severity of the climate which marked the close of the fourth\r\ninterglacial interval was such as to bring about local glaciation in\r\nsome of the mountain valleys of Britain. Here and there the glaciers\r\nprojected their moraines so far down the mountains that they rest on\r\nwhat is now the 45 to 50 feet beach. In the Alps, this fifth epoch of\r\nglaciation is represented by the so-called post-glacial moraines in\r\nthe upper valleys. This is believed to have been the last appearance\r\nof glaciers in Britain. The dissolution of these glaciers was again\r\nfollowed by an emergence of the island, and by more genial climatic\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nIn support of his conclusions, Prof. Geikie cites some striking facts\r\nwhich are not so widely known as they should be. For example, Swedish\r\ngeologists have found evidences that there was an ice sheet antedating\r\nthat which deposited the \"lower diluvium,\" and that during this earlier\r\nglaciation the direction of ice movement in southern Sweden was from\r\nthe south-east to the north-west. The ground moraine deposited by this\r\nice sheet is overlain by the \"lower diluvium\" which was produced by\r\nan ice movement from the north north-east to the south south-west, or\r\nnearly at right angles to the first. Again, near Moscow, there exist\r\ninterglacial beds whose plant remains indicate a climate milder and\r\nmore humid than that of the present time. These interglacial beds, it\r\nwill be observed, occur in the region of the \"lower diluvium\" quite\r\nbeyond the margin of the ice which produced the \"upper diluvium\" of\r\nGermany and Scandinavia. During this interglacial interval, Prof.\r\nGeikie maintains that no part of Russia could have been covered with\r\nice. If, then, within the limits of the area covered by the \"lower\r\ndiluvium,\" and not by the \"upper,\" distinct beds of glacial drift\r\nare separated by such beds as those cited, there can be no question\r\nbut that such separation marks two distinct glacial epochs. If there\r\nwas an earlier glaciation when the movement of the ice in Sweden was\r\nat right angles to that during which the lower part of the \"lower\r\ndiluvium\" was produced, this also would seem to be good evidence of\r\nthree ice epochs prior to the \"upper diluvium.\" The epoch of the \"upper\r\ndiluvium\" would then constitute the fourth glacial epoch, and this is\r\nthe interpretation of Prof. Geikie.\r\n\r\nOutside the area of the European continental ice sheet, facts are\r\nadduced in striking confirmation of the multiple ice epoch theory.\r\nThese facts are found in Switzerland, where evidences of multiple\r\nglaciation have been recognized, and in the Pyrenees where evidences\r\nof three separate ice epochs have been found. In France, evidences\r\nof an interglacial interval have been found in the region of the Puy\r\nde Dôme of such duration as to allow the excavation of valleys to a\r\ndepth of 900 feet. The length of time which would be required for such\r\nstupendous erosion must certainly be regarded as sufficient to allow\r\nthe preceding and succeeding glaciations to be considered as belonging\r\nto two distinct epochs.\r\n\r\nAnother point of great significance and interest which Prof. Geikie's\r\nessay brings out, is the correlation in Britain between epochs of\r\nglaciation and epochs of subsidence on the one hand, and between\r\ninterglacial intervals and epochs of elevation on the other. If Prof.\r\nGeikie's interpretation be well founded, and so far as we are able to\r\njudge from the facts presented this is the case, his conclusions would\r\nseem to be fatal to the hypothesis that glacial climate was produced by\r\nnorthern elevation.\r\n\r\nThe map which Prof. Geikie gives, showing the limit of ice advance\r\nduring the fourth glacial epoch, seems to us open to criticism. On the\r\nground of personal observation, the writer believes that the ice sheet\r\nof the glacial epoch here represented did not extend notably, if at\r\nall, beyond the Baltic Ridge.[18]\r\n\r\n[18] See _American Journal of Science_, May, 1887. In a recent letter,\r\nProf. Geikie indicates that he is convinced, from subsequent personal\r\nobservation, that his map is erroneous so far as the limit of the ice\r\nof this epoch is concerned. The mapping given was based on the opinion\r\nof others.\r\n\r\nProf. Geikie is an advocate of Dr. Croll's astronomical theory of\r\nglacial climate, and thinks that even five is not the full number of\r\nglacial epochs belonging to the Pleistocene period. He believes there\r\nmay have been a series of glacial epochs increasing in severity to a\r\nmaximum represented by what is now designated as the second glacial\r\nepoch. This maximum was followed by a series of epochs of diminishing\r\nseverity, represented by what he designates the third, fourth and fifth\r\nepochs. The essay is a timely contribution to glacial geology.\r\n\r\n                                                 =Rollin D.

(Proceedings of the Boston Society\r\n       of Natural History, Vol. XXV., May 18, 1892).\r\n\r\nA critical discussion of the conditions under which it is conceived\r\ncertain eskers and sand plateaus (plains) were formed. The Auburndale\r\ndistrict, ten miles east of Boston, presents three classes of modified\r\ndrift deposits;--sand plateaus, eskers, and kames. These deposits are\r\nwell exposed.\r\n\r\nThe sand plateaus have the characteristics of delta deposits of\r\nglacial streams,--even surfaces, well-bedded sands and gravels, the\r\nbeds sloping outward from the \"head\" at an angle of 12° to 20°, and in\r\nclose agreement with the slope of the plateau front, a lobate margin,\r\ndeposits distinctly coarser at the head than near the front, and a\r\nseries of nearly horizontal roughly cross-bedded gravels overlying the\r\nsloping beds.\r\n\r\nThe eskers are essentially of the same material as that of the plateau,\r\noften so poorly stratified as to render differentiation of the beds\r\ndifficult. The interstices between the pebbles are often unfilled,\r\nalthough there is abundance of fine material in adjoining layers.\r\nThis \"open work\" is taken to indicate rapid deposition, and seems to\r\npreclude the supposition that the gravels have settled down from a\r\nsuperglacial position, or been traversed by currents of any volume.\r\nIn several instances the eskers can be followed to direct union with\r\nsand plateaus. Towards its lower end the esker frequently \"gives out\r\nbranches\" and \"the adjacent lowland surface becomes more or less\r\nencumbered with sand mounds or kames,\" indicating a decayed margin of\r\nthe ice.\r\n\r\nProf. Davis' conclusions are:\r\n\r\n\"1. The eskers and sand plateaus of Auburndale and Newtonville were\r\nformed by running water just inside and outside of the ice margin in\r\nthe closing stage of the last glacial epoch.\r\n\r\n\"2. The ice-sheet was a stagnant, decaying mass at the time of their\r\nformation, as is shown by the ragged outline of its margin.\r\n\r\n\"3. Eskers and sand plateaus are genetically connected; the term,\r\nfeeding-esker, is fully warranted by the relation of the two in\r\nposition, structure, and composition.\r\n\r\n\"4. The sand plateaus were made rapidly; this is proved by the absence\r\nof disordered beds at their heads, where space would have been opened\r\nby the backward melting of the ice had the forward growth of the\r\nplateau been slow. The eskers were also made rapidly, as is shown by\r\ntheir 'open-work gravels.'\r\n\r\n\"5. The diversion of the feeding streams to other outlets left the\r\nplateaus and the eskers without further energetic action as the ice\r\nmelted away from them.\r\n\r\n\"6. The present form and structure of the eskers are more accordant\r\nwith the supposition of a subglacial origin than of a superglacial\r\norigin; but it is not intended to imply that other eskers of more\r\nirregular form and different structure could not have been deposited in\r\nsuperglacial channels.\"\r\n\r\n                                                               H.

(Transactions of the American Institute of Mining\r\n       Engineers, June, 1892).\r\n\r\nThe paper aims \"to present some of the results of observation of the\r\ngeologists of the Appalachian division during the past three years\r\non the subject of structural geology in the Appalachian province.\"\r\nThe structural features are all of one type but of different phases,\r\ncomprised in four great districts. 1) the district of close folding,\r\n2) a district whose chief structural characteristic is cleavage, 3) a\r\ndistrict of open folding, 4) a district of faulting and folding. The\r\nanswer to the questions, Why did the strata bend in the district of\r\nopen folding, and why did they break in the district of faulting, is\r\nthat the thrust affected them according to their rigidity under their\r\nrespective conditions of superincumbent load. \"We know that load up\r\nto a certain point restrains fracture in material under thrust.\" In\r\nthe district of open folding the Devonian limestone is the most rigid\r\nof the strata and \"the one which would most effectively transmit the\r\ncompressing thrust and would control the resulting structure.\" In the\r\ndistrict of open folding this limestone was prevented from breaking\r\nand faulting by a load of superincumbent strata exerting a pressure of\r\n10,000 to 23,000 pounds per square inch, while in the faulted district\r\na load of 5,000 to 10,000 pounds per square inch permitted the strata\r\nto break and fault.\r\n\r\nThe answer to the question, Why did the compression affect this\r\nzone, is given. \"It becomes apparent on study of sections that where\r\ncompression raised a great arch there previously existed a bend from\r\na nearly horizontal to a descending position in the principal stratum\r\ntransmitting the thrust. Greater anticlines and synclines originated in\r\nupward and downward convexity of initial dips, due to unequal deposits\r\nof sediments which depress underlying strata in proportion to their\r\nweight. Such folds may be called original.\" The Pottsville, Mahanoy,\r\nShamokin and Wyoming coal basins of Pennsylvania belong to this class.\r\n\r\nExperiments have recently been carried on in the office of the United\r\nStates Geological Survey reproducing the different forms of folding.\r\nThe experiments differed from other experiments in that 1) the\r\nmaterials used to simulate the stratified rocks varied in consistency\r\nfrom brittle to plastic, according to the depth at which deformation is\r\nsupposed to take place; 2) the compression was exerted under a movable\r\nload representing the weight of superincumbent strata; 3) the strata\r\nrested on a yielding base to simulate the condition of support of any\r\narc of the earth's crust. The following are the conclusions from the\r\nexperiments:\r\n\r\n1. \"When a thrust tangentially affects a stratified mass, it is\r\ntransmitted in the direction of the strata, and by each stratum\r\naccording to its inflexibility. At any bend the force is resolved into\r\ncomponents, one radial, the other tangential to the dip beyond the\r\nbend; the radial component, if directed downward, tends to depress the\r\nstratum and displace its support.\r\n\r\n2. \"A thrust so resolved can only raise an anticline or arch which is\r\nstrong enough to sustain the load lifted by its development; such an\r\narch may be called competent; and since strength is a function of the\r\nproportions of a structure, it follows that, for a given stratum, the\r\nsize of a competent anticline will vary inversely as the load; or for a\r\ngiven load the size will vary as the thickness of the effective stratum.\r\n\r\n3. \"The superincumbent load borne by a competent anticline is\r\ntransferred to the supports of the arch at the points of inflection of\r\nthe limbs.\r\n\r\n4. \"When a competent arch is raised by thrust from one side, the load\r\ntransferred may so depress the resulting syncline further from the\r\nforce that an initial dip will be produced in otherwise undisturbed\r\nstrata; this dip will rise to a bend from which a new anticline may be\r\ndeveloped. This anticline is a result of the first, and may be called\r\n'subsequent' in distinction to original folds. Since subsequent folds\r\nare simply competent structures, their size will be determined by\r\nconditions of thickness and load, and for like conditions they should\r\nbe equal; and they must, in consequence of conditions of development,\r\nbe parallel to the original fold and to each other. An example of an\r\noriginal fold with its subsequent anticlines is the Nittany arch and\r\nthe group of parallel anticlines which lie southeast of it, extending\r\nnortheast from the Broad Top basin.\"\r\n\r\n                                                               C.

(From the Proceedings of the Boston Society of\r\n       Natural History, Vol. XXV., 1891).\r\n\r\nThe post-Tertiary trenches of the Hudson and its tributaries are in the\r\nmain filled with clay beds, which, covered by a thin deposit of sand,\r\nrise in terraces 130, 150, or even 180 feet above tide-water. These\r\nclays are the result of a late glacial or post-glacial submergence of\r\nthe valley, but their upper surface does not indicate the amount of\r\ntheir submergence, as they are bottom deposits. Delta deposits made by\r\nthe tributary streams, where they entered the Hudson estuary, would\r\nindicate the amount of submergence.\r\n\r\nSuch deposits are found on the Catskill a mile north of Cairo, and\r\neroded remnants are traceable for three or four miles down stream.\r\nThe surface is characterized by great numbers of water-worn stones\r\nup to fifteen or eighteen inches in diameter. The lobate margin,\r\nwhere present, is poorly defined. These deposits range from 290 feet\r\n(aneroid) above tide, up river, to 270 feet further down. One-tenth of\r\na cubic mile of material seems to have been washed into the Catskill\r\ntrench at the point of this delta between the time of the ice departure\r\nand the elevation of the land. Subsequent terracing has removed half\r\nthat amount.\r\n\r\nThe course of the Catskill at Leeds, where it crosses a ledge of hard\r\nCorniferous limestone is probably of post-glacial superimposed origin,\r\nbut the preglacial valley cannot be definitely fixed.\r\n\r\n                                                               H.

Willard Hayes=.\r\n       (Report of the Geology of Northeastern Alabama and Adjacent\r\n       Portions of Georgia and Tennessee).\r\n\r\nThis report covers an area of 5950 miles, two-thirds in Alabama.\r\nTopographically it falls into three divisions: 1) the Cumberland\r\nand other plateaus of the northwest; 2) in the center, anticlinal\r\nvalleys--Browns and Wills, with the synclinal mountains--Sand and\r\nLookout; 3) the monoclinal mountains, the \"flatwoods\" (Coosa shales)\r\nand the chert hills (Knox limestone) of the southeast. The drainage of\r\nthe first is radial from the center of the plateau to the Tennessee;\r\nthat of the second, once consequent upon the folded structure, is now\r\nadjusted to the strike of the soft beds.\r\n\r\nThe formations are Cambrian, Silurian, Devonian and Carboniferous.\r\nTotal thickness is from 13,000 to 18,000 feet in the east, but\r\ndecreases westward. Hard sandstones of the Carboniferous form the\r\ncappings of the plateaus and synclinal mountains. In the anticlinal\r\nand monoclinal valleys the Silurian and Cambrian appear. The rocks\r\npass from the nearly horizontal beds of the plateau region, by narrow\r\nunsymmetrical anticlines with steeper dip on the northwest side, and\r\nby broad shallow synclines, to the complicated folds of the southeast.\r\nThe axes of these latter folds dip more or less abruptly northward and\r\nsouthward, causing the ridges to assume zigzag courses. Synclines are\r\noften crossed by anticlines.\r\n\r\nThrust faults exist, some of great magnitude, and traceable for 200\r\nto 300 miles. By the \"Rome thrust fault\" the Cambrian shales have\r\nbeen shoved four to five miles over upon the Carboniferous shales.\r\nMost of the overthrust strata have been worn away, but tongues of\r\nCambrian shale still remain to all appearances lying conformably upon\r\nthe Carboniferous strata. Transverse thrust faults terminate Gaylor's\r\nridge, Dirt Seller Mountain, and Lookout Mountain on the south.\r\n\r\n                                                               H. B.

(Wisconsin Academy of\r\n       Science. Vol. VIII., 1891).\r\n\r\nReferences have been made in Geological literature to the beaches of\r\nthe eastern portion of the Lake Erie basin, but up to the time of\r\nMr. Leverett's work none of the beaches had been completely traced.\r\nMr. Gilbert had discovered that several of the raised beaches do not\r\ncompletely encircle Lake Erie, and supposed that their eastern termini\r\nrepresent the successive positions of the front of the continental\r\nglacier during its retreat northeastward across the Lake Erie basin.\r\nMr. Leverett verifies this theory by demonstrating that certain\r\nmoraines are the correlatives of the beaches. They are as follows:\r\n\r\nI. The Van Wert or upper beach and its correlative moraine, the\r\nBlanchard ridge. II. The Leipsic or second beach and its correlative\r\nmoraines. III. The Belmore, or third beach and its correlative moraine.\r\n\r\nI. The Van Wert beach extends eastward from the former southwestward\r\noutlet of Lake Erie near Fort Wayne, Indiana, to Findlay, Ohio, where\r\nit joins the Blanchard moraine. Through Indiana and Ohio its altitude\r\nis quite uniformly 210 feet above Lake Erie.\r\n\r\nWhile the Van Wert beach was forming, the ice front was the\r\nnortheastern shore of the lake as far east as Findlay, Ohio, its\r\nposition being marked by the Blanchard moraine. East of Findlay, where\r\nthe Van Wert beach joins it, the moraine is of the normal type. But\r\nwest of Findlay, it presents peculiarities of topography and structure,\r\nresulting from the presence of lake water beneath the ice margin.\r\nThe water was shallow and incapable of buoying up the ice-sheet,\r\nand producing icebergs. The motion of the water under the ice-sheet\r\nproduced a variable structure. This is the only instance of a moraine\r\ndemonstrably formed in lake water.\r\n\r\nII. The Leipsic, or second beach, was formed after the ice had\r\nretreated from its position marked by the Blanchard moraine. Its\r\naltitude is 195 to 200 feet above Lake Erie. It has its terminus near\r\nCleveland, where it connects with the western end of a moraine.\r\n\r\nIII. The Belmore beach and its correlative moraine. Between the Leipsic\r\nbeach and the present shore of Lake Erie are several beaches. One of\r\nthese, the Belmore beach, terminates near Cleveland, while the others\r\nextend into southwestern New York, and probably connect with moraines,\r\nthough this connection has not been traced. The general altitude of\r\nthe Belmore beach in Ohio is 160 to 170 feet above Lake Erie. Unlike\r\nthe Van Wert and Leipsic beaches, it does not directly connect with a\r\nmoraine at its eastern end, but a gap of ten miles intervenes. Terraces\r\nat Cleveland, Mr. Leverett thinks, make a connection between the\r\neastern end of the beach and the western end of the moraine at Euclid,\r\nOhio.\r\n\r\n                                                               C.

Vol. I, No. 6, 1892).\r\n\r\n_Temperature of the Sea._--The temperature of the English Channel was\r\nsimilar to that where the isotherm of 32° F. is now situated. The\r\nwinter temperature can scarcely have been 20° colder than at present.\r\nThe Mediterranean was perhaps 5° colder than now.\r\n\r\n_Temperature of the Land (air)._--It does not appear that the climate\r\nof the lowlands of southern Europe can have been 20° lower than the\r\npresent mean; 10° or perhaps less appear to have been the refrigeration\r\nin the Mediterranean region. The temperature at the southern margin of\r\nthe ice-sheet was about 20° colder than at present. The temperature\r\nincreased rapidly towards the south. Recent observations seem to show\r\nthat throughout central Europe there was a period of _dry_ cold,\r\ncausing the country to resemble the arid regions of central Asia.\r\n\r\n                                                               J. A. B.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n  _On the Glacial Period and the Earth-Movement Hypothesis._ By\r\n       =James Geikie=, Edinburgh, Scotland. (Read before the Victoria\r\n       Institute, London).\r\n\r\nGeologists generally admit that there have been at least two glacial\r\nepochs, separated by one well-marked interglacial period. The closing\r\nstage of the Pleistocene period was one of cold conditions in\r\nnorthwestern Europe, accompanied by land depressions. After this came a\r\ngenial climate with a union of the British islands among themselves and\r\nalso with the continent. This was followed by a cold, humid condition.\r\n\r\nUpham maintains that the whole of North America north of the Gulf of\r\nMexico stood at least three thousand feet higher at the beginning of\r\nthe glacial epoch than at present. Fiords were formed before glacial\r\ntimes and so can not be cited as evidence of high land during the\r\nglacial period. An elevation of land in the northern part of North\r\nAmerica and Europe could not produce glaciation in their southern\r\nparts. The deflection of the Gulf Stream by the sinking of the Panama,\r\nProfessor Geikie argues, could not produce the conditions which\r\nprevailed during the glacial epoch. The Earth-Movement hypothesis, he\r\nbelieves, accounts neither for the widespread phenomena of the ice-age,\r\nnor for the remarkable interglacial climates. Some maintain that the\r\nwarm interglacial period was produced by the rise of the Panama land,\r\nthe sinking of the lands to the north, and the turning of the Gulf\r\nStream from the Pacific into the Atlantic. Why then, asks Professor\r\nGeikie, do we not have such a climate now?\r\n\r\n                                                               J. A.
