GIBSON]\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICAN FOREST TREES\r\n\r\nby\r\n\r\nHENRY H. GIBSON\r\n\r\nEdited by Hu Maxwell\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHardwood Record\r\nChicago\r\n1913\r\n\r\nCopyright 1913 by\r\nHardwood Record\r\nChicago, Ill.\r\n\r\nThe Regan Printing House\r\nChicago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe material on which this volume is based, appeared in Hardwood Record,\r\nChicago, in a series of articles beginning in 1905 and ending in 1913,\r\nand descriptive of the forest trees of this country. More than one\r\nhundred leading species were included in the series. They constitute the\r\nprincipal sources of lumber for the United States. The present volume\r\nincludes all the species described in the series of articles, with a\r\nlarge number of less important trees added. Every region of the country\r\nis represented; no valuable tree is omitted, and the lists and\r\ndescriptions are as complete as they can be made in the limited space of\r\na single volume. The purpose held steadily in view has been to make the\r\nwork practical, simple, plain, and to the point. Trees as they grow in\r\nthe forest, and wood as it appears at the mill and factory, are\r\ndescribed and discussed. Photographs and drawings of trunk and foliage\r\nare made to tell as much of the story as possible. The pictures used as\r\nillustrations are nearly all from photographs made specially for that\r\npurpose. They are a valuable contribution to tree knowledge, because\r\nthey show forest forms and conditions, and are as true to nature as the\r\ncamera can make them. Statistics are not given a place in these pages,\r\nfor it is no part of the plan to show the product and the output of the\r\ncountry’s mills and forests, but rather to describe the source of those\r\nproducts, the trees themselves. However, suggestions for utilization are\r\noffered, and the fitness of the various woods for many uses is\r\nparticularly indicated. The prominent physical properties are described\r\nin language as free as possible from technical terms, and yet with\r\npainstaking accuracy and clearness. Descriptions intended to aid in\r\nidentification of trees are given; but simplicity and clearness are held\r\nconstantly in view, and brevity is carefully studied. The different\r\nnames of commercial trees in the various localities where they are\r\nknown, either as standing timber or as lumber in the yard and factory,\r\nare included in the descriptions as an assistance in identification. The\r\nnatural range of the forest trees, and the regions where they abound in\r\ncommercial quantities, are outlined according to the latest and best\r\nauthorities. Estimates of present and future supply are offered, where\r\nsuch exist that seem to be authoritative. The trees are given the common\r\nand the botanical names recognized as official by the United States\r\nForest Service. This lessens misunderstanding and confusion in the\r\ndiscussion of species whose common names are not the same in different\r\nregions, and whose botanical names are not agreed upon among scientific\r\nmen who mention or describe them. The forests of the United States\r\ncontain more than five hundred kinds of trees, ranging in size from the\r\nCalifornia sequoias, which attain diameters of twenty feet or more and\r\nheights exceeding two hundred, down to indefinite but very small\r\ndimensions. The separating line between trees and shrubs is not\r\ndetermined by size alone. In a general way, shrubs may be considered\r\nsmaller than trees, but a seedling tree, no matter how small, is not\r\nproperly called a shrub. It is customary, not only among botanists, but\r\nalso among persons who do not usually recognize exact scientific terms\r\nand distinctions, to apply the name tree to all woody plants which\r\nproduce naturally in their native habitat one main, erect stem, bearing\r\na definite crown, no matter what size they may attain.\r\n\r\nThe commercial timbers of this country are divided into two classes,\r\nhardwoods and softwoods. The division is for convenience, and is\r\nsanctioned by custom, but it is not based on the actual hardness and\r\nsoftness of the different woods. The division has, however, a scientific\r\nbasis founded on the mechanical structures of the two classes of woods,\r\nand there is little disagreement among either those who use forest\r\nproducts or manufacture them, or those who investigate the actual\r\nstructure of the woods themselves, as to which belong in the hardwood\r\nand which in the softwood class.\r\n\r\n_Softwoods_--The needleleaf species, represented by pines, hemlocks,\r\nfirs, cedars, cypresses, spruces, larches, sequoias, and yews, are\r\nsoftwoods. The classification of evergreens as softwoods is erroneous,\r\nbecause all softwoods are not evergreen, and all evergreens are not\r\nsoftwoods. Larches and the southern cypress shed their leaves yearly.\r\nMost other softwoods drop only a portion of their foliage each season,\r\nand enough is always on the branches to make them evergreen. Softwoods\r\nare commonly called conebearers, and that description fits most of them,\r\nbut the cedars and yews produce fruit resembling berries rather than\r\ncones. Though the needleleaf species are classed as softwoods, there is\r\nmuch variation in the absolute hardness of the wood produced by\r\ndifferent species. The white pines are soft, the yews hard, and the\r\nother species range between. If there were no other means of separating\r\ntrees into classes than tests of actual hardness of wood, the line\r\ndividing hardwoods from softwoods might be quite different from that now\r\nso universally recognized in this country.\r\n\r\n_Hardwoods_--The broadleaf trees are hardwoods. Most, but not all, shed\r\ntheir foliage yearly. It is, therefore, incorrect to classify deciduous\r\ntrees as hardwoods, since it is not true in all cases, any more than it\r\nis true that softwoods are evergreen. Live oaks and American holly are\r\nevergreen, and yet are true hardwoods. In a test of hardness they stand\r\nnear the top of the list.\r\n\r\nThere are more species of hardwoods than of softwoods in this country;\r\nbut the actual quantity of softwood timber in the forests greatly\r\nexceeds the hardwoods. Nearly two hundred species of the latter are\r\nseldom or never seen in a sawmill, while softwoods are generally cut and\r\nused wherever found in accessible situations.\r\n\r\nAs in the case of needleleaf trees, there is much variation in actual\r\nhardness of the wood of different broadleaf species. Some which are\r\nclassed as hardwoods are softer than some in the softwood list. It is\r\napparent, therefore, that the terms hardwood and softwood are commercial\r\nrather than scientific.\r\n\r\nPalm, cactus, and other trees of that class are not often employed as\r\nlumber, and it is not customary to speak of them as either hardwoods or\r\nsoftwoods.\r\n\r\n_Sapwood and Heartwood_--Practically all mature trees contain two\r\nqualities of wood known as sap and heart. The inner portion is the\r\nheartwood, the outer the sap. They are usually distinguished by\r\ndifferences of color.\r\n\r\nThe terms are much used in lumber transactions and are well understood\r\nby the trade. The two kinds of wood need be described only in the most\r\ngeneral way, and for the guidance and information of those who are not\r\nfamiliar with them. Differences are many and radical in the relative\r\nsize and appearance of the two kinds of wood in different species, and\r\neven between different trees of the same species. No general law is\r\nfollowed, except that the heartwood forms in the interior of the tree,\r\nand the sapwood in a band outside, next to the bark. In the majority of\r\ncases young trees have little heartwood, often none. It is a development\r\nattendant on age, yet age does not always produce it. Some mature trees\r\nhave no heartwood, others very little.\r\n\r\nThe two kinds of wood belong to needleleaf and broadleaf trees alike;\r\nbut palms, owing to their manner of growth, have neither. Their size\r\nincreases in height rather than in diameter. With palms, the oldest wood\r\nis in the base of the trunk, the newest in the top; but in the ordinary\r\ntimber tree the oldest wood is in the center of the trunk, the youngest\r\nin the outside layers next the bark. It is the oldest that becomes\r\nheartwood, and it is, of course, in the center of the tree. The band of\r\nsapwood is of no certain thickness, but averages much thicker in some\r\nspecies than in others. The sapwood of Osage orange is scarcely half an\r\ninch thick, and in loblolly pine it may be six inches or more.\r\n\r\nHeartwood is known by its color. The eye can detect no other difference\r\nbetween it and the surrounding band of sapwood. There is no fundamental\r\ndifference. The heart was once sapwood, and the latter will sometime\r\nbecome heartwood if the tree lives long enough. As the trunk increases\r\nin size and years, the wood near the heart dies. It no longer has much\r\nto do with the life of the tree, except that it helps support the weight\r\nof the trunk. The heartwood is, therefore, deadwood. The activities of\r\ntree life are no longer present. The color changes, because mineral and\r\nchemical substances are deposited in the wood and fill many of the\r\ncavities. That process begins at the center of the trunk and works\r\noutward year by year, forming a pretty distinct line between the living\r\nsapwood and the dead and inert heartwood.\r\n\r\nFor some reason, the heartwood of certain species is prone to decay.\r\nSycamore is the best example. The largest trunks are generally hollow.\r\nThe heart has disappeared, leaving only the thin shell of sapwood, and\r\nthis is required not only to maintain the tree’s life and activities,\r\nbut to support the trunk’s weight. In most instances the substances\r\ndeposited in the heartwood, and associated with the coloring matter,\r\ntend to preserve the wood from decay. For that reason heart timber lasts\r\nlonger than sap when exposed in damp situations. The dark and variegated\r\nshades of the heartwood of some species give them their chief value as\r\ncabinet and furniture material. The sapwood of black walnut is not\r\nwanted by anybody, for it is light in color and is characterless; but\r\nwhen the sap has changed to heart, and its tones have been deepened by\r\nthe accumulation of pigments, it becomes a choice material for certain\r\npurposes. The same is true of many other timbers, notably sweet and\r\nyellow birch, black cherry, and several of the oaks.\r\n\r\nIt sometimes happens that when sapwood is transformed into heart, a\r\nphysical change, as well as a coloring process, affects it. Persimmon\r\nand dogwood are examples, and hickory in a less degree. The sapwood of\r\npersimmon and dogwood makes shuttles and golf heads, but after the\r\nchange to heartwood occurs, it is considered unsuitable. Handle makers\r\nand the manufacturers of buggy spokes prefer hickory sapwood, but use\r\nthe red heartwood if it is the same weight as the sap.\r\n\r\n_Annual Rings_--The trunks of both hardwoods and softwoods are made up\r\nof concentric rings. In most instances the eye easily detects them. They\r\nare more distinct in a freshly cut trunk than in weathered wood, though\r\nin a few instances weathering accentuates rather than obliterates them.\r\nA count of the rings gives the tree’s age in years, each ring being the\r\ngrowth of one year. An occasional exception should be noted, as when\r\naccident checks the tree’s growth in the middle of the season, and the\r\ngrowth is later resumed. In that case, it may develop two rings in one\r\nyear. A severe frost late in spring after leaves have started may\r\nproduce that result; or defoliation by caterpillars in early summer may\r\ndo it. Perhaps not one tree in a thousand has that experience in the\r\ncourse of its whole life. Trees in the tropics where seasons are nearly\r\nthe same the year through, seldom have rings. Imitations of mahogany are\r\nsometimes detected by noting clearly marked annual rings. It is\r\ndifficult for the woodfinisher to obliterate the annual rings, but some\r\nof the French woodworkers very nearly accomplish it.\r\n\r\nNo law of growth governs the width of yearly rings, but circumstances\r\nhave much to do with it. When the tree’s increase in size is rapid,\r\nrings are broad. An uncrowded tree in good soil and climate grows much\r\nfaster than if circumstances are adverse. Carolina poplar and black\r\nwillow sometimes have rings nearly three-fourths of an inch broad, while\r\nin the white bark pine, which grows above the snow line in California,\r\nthe rings may be so narrow as to be invisible to the naked eye.\r\n\r\nThere is no average width of yearly rings and no average age of trees. A\r\nfew (very few) of the sequoias, or “big trees” of California, are two\r\nthousand years old. An age of six or seven centuries appears to be about\r\nthe limit of the oldest of the other species in this country, though an\r\nauthentic statement to that effect cannot be made. There are species\r\nwhose life average scarcely exceeds that of men. The aspen generally\r\nfalls before it is eighty; and fire cherry scarcely averages half of\r\nthat. Of all the trees cut for lumber, perhaps not one in a hundred has\r\npassed the three century mark. That ratio would not hold if applied to\r\nthe Pacific coast alone.\r\n\r\n_Spring and Summerwood_--These are not usual terms with lumbermen and\r\nwoodworkers, but belong more to the engineer who thinks of physical\r\nproperties of timber, particularly its strength. Yet, sawmill and\r\nfactory men are well acquainted with the two kinds of wood, but they are\r\nlikely to apply the term “grain” to the combination of the two.\r\n\r\nSpring and summerwood make the annual ring. Springwood grows early in\r\nthe season, summerwood later. In fact, it usually is the contrast in\r\ncolor where the summerwood of one season abuts against the springwood of\r\nthe next which makes the ring visible. The inside of the ring--that\r\nportion nearest the heart of the tree--is the springwood, the rest of\r\nthe ring is the summerwood. The former is generally lighter in color.\r\nSometimes, and with certain species, the springwood is much broader than\r\nthe other. The summerwood may be a very narrow band, not much wider than\r\na fine pencil mark, but its deeper color makes it quite distinct in most\r\ninstances. In other instances, as with some of the oaks, the summerwood\r\nis the wider part of the annual ring. The figure or “grain” of southern\r\nyellow pine is largely due to the contrast between the dark summerwood\r\nand light springwood of the rings. The same is true of ash, chestnut,\r\nand of many other woods.\r\n\r\n_Pores_--Wood is not the solid substance it seems to be when seen in the\r\nmass. If magnified it appears filled with cavities, not unlike a piece\r\nof coral or honeycomb; but to the unaided eye only a few of the largest\r\nopenings are visible, and in some woods like maple, none can be seen.\r\nThe large openings are known as pores. They are so prominent in some of\r\nthe oaks that in a clean cut end or cross section they look like pin\r\nholes. Very little magnifying is required to bring them out distinctly.\r\nA good reading glass is sufficient.\r\n\r\nPores belong to hardwoods only. The resin ducts in some softwoods\r\npresent a similar appearance, but are far less numerous. All pores are,\r\nof course, situated in the annual rings, but in different species they\r\nare differently located as to spring and summerwood. In some woods the\r\nlargest pores are in the springwood only and therefore run in rings.\r\nSuch woods are called “ring porous,” and the oaks are best examples. In\r\nother species the pores are scattered through all parts of the ring in\r\nabout the same proportion, and such woods are called “diffuse porous,”\r\nas the birches. Softwoods have no pores proper, and are classed\r\n“non-porous.”\r\n\r\n_Medullary Rays_--A smoothly-cut cross section of almost any oak, but\r\nparticularly white oak and red oak, exhibits to the unaided eye narrow,\r\nlight-colored lines radiating from the center of the tree toward the\r\nbark like spokes of a wheel. They are about the breadth of a fine pencil\r\nmark, and are generally a sixth of an inch or less apart. They are among\r\nthe most conspicuous and characteristic features of oak wood, and are\r\nknown as medullary or pith rays.\r\n\r\nOak is cited as an example because the rays are large and prominent, but\r\nthey are present in all wood, and constitute a large part of its body.\r\nThey vary greatly in size. In some woods a few are visible unmagnified;\r\nbut even in oak a hundred are invisible to the naked eye to one that can\r\nbe seen. Some species show none until a glass is used. Some pines have\r\nfifteen thousand to a square inch of cross section, all of which are so\r\nsmall as to elude successfully the closest search of the unaided eye.\r\n\r\nThe medullary rays influence the appearance of most wood. They determine\r\nits character. Oak is quarter-sawed for the purpose of bringing out the\r\nbright, flat surfaces of these rays. The prominent flecks, streaks, and\r\npatches of silvery wood are the flat sides of medullary rays. In cross\r\nsection, only the line-like ends are seen, but quarter-sawing exposes\r\ntheir sides to view.\r\n\r\nThat explains in part why some species are adapted to quarter-sawing and\r\nothers are not. If no broad rays exist in the wood, as with white pine,\r\nred cedar, and cottonwood, quarter-sawing cannot add much to the wood’s\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\n_Grain_--The grain of wood is not a definite quality. The word does not\r\nmean the same thing to all who use it. It sometimes refers to rings of\r\nyearly growth, and in that sense a narrow-ringed wood is fine grained,\r\nand one with wide rings is coarse grained. A curly, wavy, smoky, or\r\nbirdseye wood does not owe its quality to annual rings, yet with some\r\npersons, all of these figures are called grain. The term sometimes\r\nrefers to medullary rays, again to hardness, or to roughness. Some\r\nmahogany is called “woolly grained” because the surface polishes with\r\ndifficulty. The pattern maker designates white pine as “even grained”,\r\nbecause it cuts easily in all directions. The handle maker classes\r\nhickory as “smooth grained”, because it polishes well and the sole idea\r\nof the maker is smoothness to the touch. There are other grains almost\r\nas numerous as the trades which use wood. In numerous instances “figure”\r\nis a better term than “grain.” Feather mahogany, birdseye birch, burl\r\nash, are figures rather than grains. There is no authority to settle and\r\ndecide what the real meaning of grain is in wood technology. It has a\r\nnumber of meanings, and one man has as much authority as another to\r\ninterpret it in accordance with his own ideas, and the usage in his\r\ntrade. It is a loose term which covers several things in general and\r\nnothing in particular.\r\n\r\n_Weight_--The weight of wood is calculated from different standpoints.\r\nIt has a green weight, an air-dry weight, a kiln-dry weight, and an\r\noven-dry weight. All are different, but the differences are due to the\r\nrelative amounts of water weighed. Sawlogs generally go by green weight;\r\nyard lumber by air-dry or partly air-dry weight; while the wood used in\r\nultimate manufacture, such as furniture, is supposed to be kiln-dry.\r\n\r\nThe absolute weight of wood, with all air spaces, moisture, and other\r\nforeign material removed, is about 100 pounds per cubic foot, which is\r\n1.6 times heavier than water; but that is not a natural form of wood. It\r\nis known only in the laboratory.\r\n\r\nThe actual wood substance of one species weighs about the same as\r\nanother. Dispense with all air spaces, all water, and all other foreign\r\nsubstance, and pine and ebony weigh alike. It is apparent that the\r\ndifferent weights of woods, as between cedar and oak for example, are\r\ndue chiefly to porosity. The smaller the aggregate space occupied by\r\npores and other cavities, the heavier the wood. That accounts for the\r\ndifferences in weights of absolutely dry woods of different kinds,\r\nexcept that a small amount of other foreign material may remain after\r\nwater has been driven off. Florida black ironwood is rated as the\r\nheaviest in the United States, and it weighs 81.14 pounds per cubic\r\nfoot, oven-dry. The lightest in this country is the golden fig which is\r\na native of Florida also. It weighs 16.3 pounds per cubic foot,\r\noven-dry. When weights of wood are given, the specimen is understood to\r\nbe oven-dry, unless it is stated to be otherwise: it is a laboratory\r\nweight, calculated from small cubes of the wood. Such weights are always\r\na little less than that of the dryest wood of the same kind that can be\r\nobtained in the lumber market.\r\n\r\n_Moisture in Wood_--The varying weights of the same wood indicate that\r\nmoisture plays an important part. No man ever saw absolutely dry wood.\r\nIf heated sufficiently to drive off all the moisture, the wood is\r\nreduced to charcoal and other products of destructive distillation.\r\n\r\nThe pores and other cavities in green timber are more or less filled\r\nwith water or sap. This may amount to one-third, one-half, or even more,\r\nof the dry weight of the wood. The water is in the hollow vessels and\r\ncell walls. A living tree contains about the same quantity of water in\r\nwinter as in summer, though the common belief is otherwise. It is\r\nmisleading to say that the sap is “down” in one season and “up” in\r\nanother, although there is more activity at certain times than in\r\nothers. Strictly speaking, there is a difference between the water in a\r\ntree, and the tree’s sap; but in common parlance they are considered\r\nidentical. What takes place is this: water rises from the tree’s roots,\r\nthrough the wood, carrying certain minerals in solution. Some of it\r\nreaches the leaves in summer where it mixes with certain gases from the\r\nair, and is converted into sap proper. Most of the surplus water, after\r\ngiving up the mineral substance held in solution, is evaporated through\r\nthe leaves into the air; but the sap, starting from the leaves which act\r\nas laboratories for its manufacture, goes down through the newly-formed\r\n(and forming), layer of wood just beneath the bark, and is converted\r\ninto wood. This newly-formed wood is colorless at first. It builds up\r\nthe annual ring, first the springwood very rapidly, and then the\r\nsummerwood more slowly.\r\n\r\nThe force which causes water to rise through the trunk of a tree is not\r\nfully understood. It is one of nature’s mysteries which is yet to be\r\nsolved. Forces known as root pressure, capillary attraction, and\r\nosmosis, are believed to be active in the process, but there seems to be\r\nsomething additional, and no man has yet been able to explain what it\r\nis.\r\n\r\nThe seasoning of wood is the process of getting rid of some of the\r\nwater. As soon as lumber is exposed to air, the water begins to escape.\r\nLong exposure to dry air takes out a large percentage of the moisture\r\nwhich green wood holds, and the lumber is known as air-dry. But some of\r\nthe original moisture remains, and air at climatic temperature is unable\r\nto expel it. The greater heat of a drykiln drives away some more of it,\r\nbut a quantity yet remains. The lumber is then kiln-dry. Greater heat\r\nthan the drykiln’s is secured in an oven, and a little more of the\r\nwood’s moisture is expelled; but the only method of driving all the\r\nmoisture out is to heat the wood sufficiently to break down its\r\nstructure, and reduce it to charcoal.\r\n\r\nWood warps in the process of drying unless it seasons equally on all\r\nsides. It curls or bends toward the side which dries most rapidly. Dry\r\nwood may warp if exposed to dampness, if one side is more exposed and\r\nreceives more moisture than another. It curls or bends toward the dryer\r\nside.\r\n\r\nWarping is primarily due to the more rapid contraction or expansion of\r\nwood cells on one side of the piece than on the other. Saturated cells\r\nare larger than dry ones.\r\n\r\nMoisture in wood affects its strength, the dryer the stronger, at least\r\nwithin certain limits. Architects and builders carefully study the\r\nseasoning of timber, because it is a most important factor in their\r\nbusiness. The moisture which most affects a wood’s strength is that\r\nabsorbed in the cell walls, rather than that contained in the cell\r\ncavities themselves.\r\n\r\nSome woods check or split badly in seasoning unless attended with\r\nconstant care. Checking is due chiefly to lack of uniformity in\r\nseasoning. One part of the stick dries faster than another, the dryer\r\nfibers contract, and the pull splits the wood. The checks may be small,\r\neven microscopic, or they may develop yawning cracks such as sometimes\r\nappear in the ends of hickory and black walnut logs. Greenwood checks\r\nworse in summer than in winter, because the weather is warmer, the\r\nwood’s surface dries faster, and the strain on the fibers is greater.\r\nPhases of the moon have no influence on the seasoning, checking,\r\nwarping, or lasting properties of timber.\r\n\r\n_Stiffness, Elasticity, and Strength_--Rules for measuring the stiffness\r\nof timber are involved in mathematical formulas; but the practical\r\nquality of stiffness is not difficult to understand. Wood which does not\r\nbend easily is stiff. If it springs back to its original position after\r\nthe removal of the force which bends it, the wood is elastic. The\r\ngreatest load it can sustain without breaking, is the measure of its\r\nstrength. The load required to produce a certain amount of bending is\r\nthe measure of its stiffness. Flexibility, a term much used by certain\r\nclasses of workers in wood, is the opposite of stiffness. A brittle wood\r\nis not necessarily weak. It may sustain a heavy load without breaking,\r\nbut when it fails, the break is sudden and complete. A tough wood\r\nbehaves differently, though it may not be as strong as a brittle one.\r\nWhen a tough wood breaks, the parts are inclined to adhere after they\r\nhave ceased to sustain the load. Hickory is tough, and in breaking, the\r\nwood crushes and splinters. Mesquite is brittle, and a clean snap severs\r\nthe stick at once.\r\n\r\nBuilders of houses and bridges, and the manufacturers of articles of\r\nwood, study with the greatest care the stiffness, elasticity, strength,\r\ntoughness, and brittleness of timber. Its chief value may depend upon\r\nthe presence or absence of one or more of these properties. Take away\r\nhickory’s toughness and elasticity and it would cease to be a great\r\nvehicle and handle material. Reduce the stiffness and strength of\r\nlongleaf pine and Douglas fir and they would drop at once from the high\r\nesteem in which they are held as structural timbers. Destroy the\r\nbrittleness of red cedar and it would lose one of the chief qualities\r\nwhich make it the leading lead pencil wood of the world.\r\n\r\nThere are recognized methods of measuring these important physical\r\nproperties of woods, but they are expressed in language so technical\r\nthat it means little to persons who are not specialists. For ordinary\r\npurposes, it is unnecessary to be more explicit than to state a certain\r\nwood is or is not strong, stiff, tough and elastic. Some species possess\r\none or more of these properties to double the degree that others possess\r\nthem. Different trees of the same species differ greatly, and even\r\ndifferent parts of the same tree. Most tables of figures which show the\r\nvarious physical properties of woods, give averages only, not absolute\r\nvalues.\r\n\r\n_Hardness_--In some woods hardness is considered an advantage, but not\r\nin others. If sugar maple were as soft as white pine, it would not be\r\nthe great floor material it is; and if white pine were as hard as maple,\r\npattern makers would not want it, door and sash manufacturers would get\r\nalong with less, and it would not be the leading packing box material in\r\nso wide a region.\r\n\r\nIt is generally the summer growth in the annual rings which makes a wood\r\nhard. The summerwood is dense. A given bulk of it contains more actual\r\nwood substance and less air and water than the springwood. For the same\r\nreason, summerwood gives weight, and a relationship between hardness and\r\nweight holds generally. It may be added that strength goes with weight\r\nand hardness, but it is not a rule without apparent exceptions.\r\n\r\nSome woods possess twice or three times the hardness of others. Among\r\nsome of the hardest in the United States are hickory, sugar maple,\r\nmesquite, the Florida ironwoods, Osage orange, locust, persimmon, and\r\nthe best oak and elm. Among the softest species are buckeye, basswood,\r\ncedar, redwood, some of the pines, spruce, hemlock, and chestnut.\r\n\r\nThe hardness of wood is tested with a machine which records the pressure\r\nrequired to indent the surface. The condition of the specimen, as to\r\ndryness, has much to do with its hardness. So many other factors\r\nexercise influence that nothing less than an actual test will determine\r\nthe hardness of a sample. A table of figures can show it only\r\napproximately and by averages.\r\n\r\n_Cleavability_--Wood users generally demand a material which does not\r\nsplit easily, but the reverse is sometimes required. Rived staves must\r\ncome from timbers which split easily. Many handles are from billets\r\nwhich are split in rough form and are afterwards dressed to the required\r\nsize and shape. In these instances, splitting is preferable to sawing,\r\nbecause a rived billet is free from cross grain.\r\n\r\nThe cleavability of woods differs greatly. Some can scarcely be split.\r\nBlack gum is in that list, and sycamore to a less extent. Young trees of\r\nsome species split more readily than old, while with others, the\r\nadvantage is with the old. Young sycamore may generally be split with\r\nease, but old trunks seem to develop interlocked fibers which defy the\r\nwedge. A white oak pole is hard to split, but the old tree yields\r\nreadily. Few woods are more easily split than chestnut. With most\r\ntimbers cleavage is easiest along the radial lines, that is, from the\r\nheart to the bark. The flat sides of the medullary rays lie in that\r\nplane. Cleavage along tangential lines is easy with some woods. The line\r\nof cleavage follows the soft springwood. Green timber is generally, but\r\nnot always, more easily split than dry. As a rule, the more elastic a\r\nwood is, the more readily it may be split.\r\n\r\n_Durability_--In Egypt where climatic conditions are highly favorable,\r\nLebanon cedar, North African acacia, East African persimmon, and\r\noriental sycamore have remained sound during three or four thousand\r\nyears. In the moist forests of the northwestern Pacific coast, an alder\r\nlog six or eight inches in diameter will decay through and through in a\r\nsingle year. No wood is immune to decay if exposed to influences which\r\ninduce it, but some resist for long periods. Osage orange and locust\r\nfence posts may stand half a century. Timber from which air is excluded,\r\nas when deeply buried in wet earth or under water, will last\r\nindefinitely; but if it is exposed to alternate dampness and dryness,\r\ndecay will destroy it in a few years.\r\n\r\nIt is apparent that resistance to decay is not a property inherent in\r\nthe wood, but depends on circumstances. However, the ability to resist\r\ndecay varies greatly with different species, under similar\r\ncircumstances. Buckeye and red cedar fence posts, situated alike, will\r\nnot last alike. The buckeye may be expected to fall in two or three\r\nyears, and the cedar will stand twenty. Timbers light in weight and\r\nlight in color are, as a class, quick-decaying when exposed to the\r\nweather.\r\n\r\nThe rule holds in most cases that sapwood decays more quickly than heart\r\nwhen both are subject to similar exposure. The matter of decay is not\r\nimportant when lumber and other products intended for use are in dry\r\nsituations. Furniture and interior house finish do not decay under\r\nordinary circumstances, no matter what the species of wood may be; but\r\nresistance to decay overshadows almost any other consideration in\r\nchoosing mine timbers, crossties, fence posts, and tanks and silos.\r\n\r\nDecay in timber is not simply a chemical process, but is due primarily\r\nto the activities of a low order of plants known as fungi, sometimes\r\nbacteria. The fungi produce thread-like filaments which penetrate the\r\nbody of the wood, ramifying in and passing from cell to cell, absorbing\r\ncertain materials therein, and ultimately breaking down and destroying\r\nthe structure of the wood. Both air and dampness are essential to the\r\ngrowth of fungus. That is the reason why timbers deep beneath ground or\r\nwater do not decay. Air is absent, though moisture is abundant; while in\r\nthe dry Egyptian tombs, air is abundant but moisture is wanting, fungus\r\ncannot exist, and consequently decay of the wood does not occur. Nothing\r\nis needed to render timber immune to decay except to keep fungus out of\r\nthe cells. Some of the fungus concerned in wood rotting is microscopic,\r\nwhile other appears in forms and sizes easily seen and recognized.\r\n\r\nTimber may be protected for a time against the agencies of decay by\r\ncovering the surface with paint, thereby preventing the entrance of\r\nfungus. By another process, certain oils or other materials which are\r\npoisonous to the insinuating threads of fungus, are forced into the\r\npores of the wood. Creosote is often used for this purpose. Attacks are\r\nthus warded off, and decay is hindered. The preservative fluid will not\r\nremain permanently in wood exposed to weather conditions, but the period\r\nduring which it affords protection and immunity extends over some years;\r\nbut different woods vary greatly in their ability to receive and retain\r\npreservative mixtures.\r\n\r\nThe better seasoned, the less liable is timber to decay, because it\r\ncontains less moisture to support fungi. It is generally supposed that\r\ntimber cut in the fall of the year is less subject to decay than if\r\nfelled in summer. If it is so, the reason for it lies in the fact that\r\nfungus is inactive during winter, and before the coming of warm weather\r\nthe timber has partly dried near the surface, and fungi cannot pass\r\nthrough the dry outside to reach the interior. Timber cut in warm\r\nweather may be attacked at once, and before cold weather stops the\r\nactivities of fungus it has reached the interior of the wood and the\r\nprocess of rotting is under way. When the agents of decay have begun to\r\ngrow in the wood, destruction will go on as long as air and moisture\r\nconditions are favorable.\r\n\r\nThe bluing of wood is an incipient decay and is generally due to fungus.\r\nSome kinds of wood are more susceptible to bluing than others. Though\r\nboards may quickly season sufficiently to put a stop to the bluing\r\nprocess before it has actually weakened the material, the result is more\r\nor less injurious. The wood’s natural color and luster undergo\r\ndeterioration; it does not reflect light as formerly, and seems dead and\r\nflat.\r\n\r\nDecay affects sapwood more readily than heart. The reason may be that\r\nsapwood contains more food for fungus, thereby inducing greater\r\nactivity. The sapwood is on the outside of timbers and is often more\r\nexposed than the heart. In some instances greater decay may be due to\r\ngreater exposure. Another reason for more rapid decay of sapwood than\r\nheart is the fact that the pores of the heartwood are more or less\r\nfilled with coloring matter deposited while the growth of the tree was\r\nin progress. The coloring matter, in many cases, acts as a preservative;\r\nit shuts the threads of fungus out. Sometimes the sapwood of a dead tree\r\nor a log is totally destroyed while the heart remains sound. This often\r\nhappens with red cedar and sometimes with black walnut, yellow poplar,\r\nand cherry. Occasionally a tree’s bark is more resistant to decay than\r\nits wood. Paper birch and yellow birch logs in damp situations\r\noccasionally show this. What appears to be a solid fallen trunk, proves\r\nto be nothing more than a shell of bark with a soft, pulpy mass of\r\ndecayed wood within.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHITE PINE\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHITE PINE]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHITE PINE[1]\r\n\r\n(_Pinus Strobus_)\r\n\r\n    [1] The following 12 species are usually classed soft pines: White\r\n    Pine (_Pinus strobus_); Sugar Pine (_Pinus lambertiana_); Western\r\n    White Pine (_Pinus monticola_); Mexican White Pine (_Pinus\r\n    strobiformis_); Limber Pine (_Pinus flexilis_); Whitebark Pine\r\n    (_Pinus albicaulis_); Foxtail Pine (_Pinus balfouriana_); Parry Pine\r\n    (_Pinus quadrifolia_); Mexican Pinon (_Pinus cembroides_); Pinon\r\n    (_Pinus edulis_); Singleleaf Pinon (_Pinus monophylla_); Bristlecone\r\n    Pine (_Pinus aristata_).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe best known wood of the United States has never been burdened with a\r\nmultitude of names, as many minor species have. It is commonly known as\r\nwhite pine in every region where it grows, and in many where the living\r\ntree is never seen, except when planted for ornament. The light color of\r\nthe wood suggests the name. The bark and the foliage are of somber hue,\r\nthough not as dark as hemlock and many of the pines. The name Weymouth\r\npine is occasionally heard, but it is more used in books than by\r\nlumbermen. It is commonly supposed that the name refers to Lord Weymouth\r\nwho interested himself in the tree at an early period, but this has been\r\ndisputed. In Pennsylvania it is occasionally called soft pine to\r\ndistinguish it from the harder and inferior pitch pine and table\r\nmountain pine with which it is sometimes associated. It is the softest\r\nof the pines, and the name is not inappropriate. In some regions of the\r\nSouth, where it is well known, it is called northern spruce pine in\r\nrecognition of the fact that it is a northern species which has followed\r\nthe Appalachian mountain ranges some hundreds of miles southward. There\r\nis no good reason for this name when applied to white pine. It should be\r\nremembered, however, that no less than a dozen tree species in the\r\nUnited States are sometimes called spruce pine. Cork pine is a trade\r\nname applied more frequently to the wood than to the living tree. It is\r\nthe wood of old, mature, first class trunks, as nearly perfect as can be\r\nfound. Pumpkin pine is another name given to the same class of wood. It\r\nis so named because the grain is homogeneous, like a pumpkin, and may be\r\nreadily cut and carved in any direction. It is the ideal wood for the\r\npattern maker, but it is now hard to get because the venerable white\r\npines, many hundred years old, are practically gone.\r\n\r\nThe northern limit of the range of white pine stretches from\r\nNewfoundland to Manitoba, more than 1800 miles east and west across the\r\nDominion of Canada, and southward to northern Georgia, 1200 miles in a\r\nnorth and south direction. But white pine does not grow in all parts of\r\nthe territory thus delimited. It attained magnificent development in\r\ncertain large regions before lumbering began, and in others it was\r\nscarce or totally wanting. Its ability to maintain itself on land too\r\nthin for vigorous hardwood growth gave it a monopoly of enormous\r\nstretches of sandy country, particularly in the Lake States. It occupied\r\nlarge areas in New England and southern Canada; developed splendid\r\nstands in New York and Pennsylvania; and it covered certain mountains\r\nand uplands southward along the mountain ranges across Maryland, West\r\nVirginia, and the elevated regions two or three hundred miles farther\r\nsouth.\r\n\r\nA dozen or more varieties of white pine have been developed under\r\ncultivation, but they interest the nurseryman, not the lumberman. In all\r\nthe wide extension of its range, and during all past time, nature was\r\nnever able to develop a single variety of white pine which departed from\r\nthe typical species. For that reason it is one of the most interesting\r\nobjects of study in the tree kingdom. True, the white pine in the\r\nsouthern mountains differs slightly from the northern tree, but\r\nbotanically it is the same. Its wood is a little heavier, its branches\r\nare more resinous and consequently adhere a longer time to the trunk\r\nafter they die, resulting in lumber with more knots. The southern wood\r\nis more tinged with red, the knots are redder and usually sounder than\r\nin the North.\r\n\r\nIt is unfortunately necessary in speaking of white pine forests to use\r\nthe past tense, for most of the primeval stands have disappeared. The\r\nrange is as extensive as ever, because wherever a forest once grew, a\r\nfew trees remain; but the merchantable timber has been cut in most\r\nregions. The tree bears winged seeds which quickly scatter over vacant\r\nspaces, and new growth would long ago, in most cases, have taken the\r\nplace of the old, had not fires persistently destroyed the seedlings. In\r\nparts of New England where fire protection is afforded, dense stands of\r\nwhite pine are coming on, and in numerous instances profitable lumber\r\noperations are carried on in second growth forests. That condition does\r\nnot exist generally in white pine regions. Primeval stands were seldom\r\nabsolutely pure, but sometimes, in bodies of thousands of acres, there\r\nwas little but white pine. Generally hardwoods or other softwoods grew\r\nwith the pine. At its best, it is the largest pine of the United States,\r\nexcept the sugar pine of California. The largest trees grew in New\r\nEngland where diameters of six or more feet and heights exceeding 200\r\nfeet were found. A diameter of four and five feet and a height of 150\r\nfeet are about the size limits in the Lake States and the southern\r\nmountains. Trees two or three feet through and ninety and 120 tall are a\r\nfair average for mature timber.\r\n\r\nThe wood of white pine is among the lightest of the commercial timbers\r\nof this country, and among the softest. While it is not strong, it\r\ncompares favorably, weight for weight, with most others. It is of rather\r\nrapid growth, and the rings of annual increase are clearly defined, and\r\nthey contain comparatively few resin ducts. For that reason it may be\r\nclassed as a close, compact wood. It polishes well, may be cut with\r\ngreat ease, and after it is seasoned it holds its form better than most\r\nwoods. That property fits it admirably for doors and sash and for\r\nbacking of veneer, where a little warping or twisting would do much\r\nharm.\r\n\r\nThe medullary rays are numerous but are too small to be easily seen\r\nseparately, and do not figure much in the appearance of the wood. The\r\nresin passages are few and small, but the wood contains enough resin to\r\ngive it a characteristic odor, which is not usually considered injurious\r\nto merchandise shipped in pine boxes. The white color of the wood gives\r\nit much of its value. Though rather weak, white pine is stiff, rather\r\nlow in elasticity, is practically wanting in toughness, has little\r\nfigure, and when exposed to alternate dryness and dampness it is rated\r\npoor in lasting properties; yet shingles and weather boarding of this\r\nwood have been known to stand half a century. The sapwood is lighter in\r\ncolor than the heart, and decays more quickly.\r\n\r\nAs long as white pine was abundant it surpassed all other woods of this\r\ncountry in the amount used. It was one of the earliest exports from New\r\nEngland, and it went to the West Indies and to Europe. England attempted\r\nto control the cutting and export of white pine, but was unsuccessful.\r\nAt an early period the rivers were utilized for transporting the logs\r\nand the lumber to market, and that method has continued until the\r\npresent time. Spectacular log drives were common in early times in New\r\nEngland, later in New York and Pennsylvania, and still later in Michigan\r\nand the other Lake States. Many billions of feet of faultless logs have\r\ngone down flooded rivers. The scenes in the woods and the life in lumber\r\ncamps have been written in novels and romances, and the central figure\r\nof it all was white pine.\r\n\r\nThere are a few things for which this wood is not suitable; otherwise\r\nits use has been nearly universal in some parts of this country. It went\r\ninto masts and matches, which are the largest and smallest commodities,\r\nand into almost every shape and size of product between. Most of the\r\nearly houses and barns in the pine region were built of it. Hewed pine\r\nwas the foundation, and the shingles were of split and shaved pine. It\r\nformed floors, doors, sash, and shutters. It was the ceiling within and\r\nthe weather boarding without. It fenced the fields and bridged the\r\nstreams. It went to market as rough lumber, and planing mills turned it\r\nout as dressed stock in various forms. It has probably been more\r\nextensively employed by box makers than any other wood, and though it is\r\nscarcer than formerly, hundreds of millions of feet of it are still used\r\nannually by box makers. Scores of millions of feet yearly are demanded\r\nby the manufacturers of window shade rollers, though individually the\r\nroller is a very small commodity. In this, as for patterns and many\r\nother things, no satisfactory substitute for white pine has been found.\r\n\r\nAs a timber tree, it will not disappear from this country, though the\r\ndays of its greatest importance are past. Enormous tracts where it once\r\ngrew will apparently never again produce a white pine sawlog. The\r\nprospect is more encouraging in other regions, and there will always be\r\na considerable quantity of this lumber in the American market, though\r\nthe high percentage of good grades which prevailed in the past will not\r\ncontinue in the future.\r\n\r\nWhite pine belongs in the five needle group, that is, five leaves grow\r\nin a bundle. They turn yellow and fall in the autumn of the second year.\r\nThe cones are slender, are from five to eleven inches in length, and\r\nripen and disperse their seeds in the autumn of the second year.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWESTERN WHITE PINE\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WESTERN WHITE PINE]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWESTERN WHITE PINE\r\n\r\n(_Pinus Monticola_)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe silvery luster of the needles of this tree gives it the name silver\r\npine, by which many people know it. It appears in literature as mountain\r\nWeymouth pine, the reference being to the eastern white pine (_Pinus\r\nstrobus_), which is sometimes called Weymouth pine. Finger-cone pine is\r\na California name; so are mountain pine and soft pine. In the same state\r\nit is called little sugar pine, to distinguish it from sugar pine\r\n(_Pinus lambertiana_), which it resembles in some particulars but not in\r\nall. It is thus seen that California is generous in bestowing names on\r\nthis tree, notwithstanding it is not abundant in any part of that state\r\nand is unknown in most parts.\r\n\r\nThe botanical name means “mountain pine,” and that describes the\r\nspecies. It does best among the mountains, and it ranges from an\r\naltitude of from 4,000 feet to 10,000 on the Sierra Nevada mountains.\r\nSometimes trees of very large size are found near the upper limits of\r\nits range, but the best stands are in valleys and on slopes at lower\r\naltitudes. Its range lies in British Columbia, Montana, Idaho,\r\nWashington, Oregon, and California. In the latter state it follows the\r\nSierra Nevada mountains southward to the San Joaquin river.\r\n\r\nThis species has been compared with the white pine of the East oftener\r\nthan with any other species. The weights of the two woods are nearly the\r\nsame, and both are light. Their fuel values are about the same. The\r\nstrength of the eastern tree is a little higher, but the western species\r\nis stiffer. The woods of both are light in color, but that of the\r\neastern tree is whiter; both are soft, but again the advantage is with\r\nthe eastern tree. The western pine generally grows rapidly and the\r\nannual rings are wide; but, like most other species, it varies in its\r\nrate of growth, and trunks are found with narrow rings. The summerwood\r\nis thin, not conspicuous, and slightly resinous. The small resin\r\npassages are numerous. The heartwood is fairly durable in contact with\r\nthe soil.\r\n\r\nThe western white pine has entered many markets in recent years, but it\r\nis difficult to determine what the annual cut is. Statistics often\r\ninclude this species and the western yellow pine under one name, or at\r\nleast confuse one with the other, and there is no way to determine\r\nexactly how much of the sawmill output belongs to each. The bulk of\r\nmerchantable western white pine lumber is cut in Idaho and Montana. The\r\nstands are seldom pure, but this species frequently predominates over\r\nits associates. When pure forests are found, the yield is sometimes\r\nvery high, as much as 130,000 feet of logs growing on a single acre.\r\nThat quantity is not often equalled by any other forest tree, though\r\nredwood and Douglas fir sometimes go considerably above it.\r\n\r\nThe western white pine’s needles grow in clusters of five and are from\r\none and a half to four inches long. The cones are from ten to eighteen\r\ninches long. The seeds ripen the second year. Reproduction is vigorous\r\nand the forest stands are holding their own. Trees about one hundred and\r\nseventy-five feet high and eight feet in diameter are met with, but the\r\naverage size is one hundred feet high and from two to three feet in\r\ndiameter, or about the size of eastern white pine.\r\n\r\nThe wood is useful and has been giving service since the settlement of\r\nthe country began, fifty or more years ago. Choice trunks were split for\r\nshakes or shingles, but the wood is inferior in splitting qualities to\r\neither eastern white pine or California sugar pine, because of more\r\nknots. The western white pine does not prime itself early or well. Dead\r\nlimbs adhere to the trunk long after the sugar pine would shed them. In\r\nsplit products, the western white pine’s principal rival has been the\r\nwestern red cedar. The pine has been much employed for mine timbers in\r\nthe region where it is abundant. Miners generally take the most\r\nconvenient wood for props, stulls, and lagging. A little higher use for\r\npine is found among the mines, where is it made into tanks, flumes,\r\nsluice boxes, water pipes, riffle blocks, rockers, and guides for stamp\r\nmills. However, the total quantity used by miners is comparatively\r\nsmall. Much more goes to ranches for fences and buildings. It is\r\nserviceable, and is shipped outside the immediate region of production\r\nand is marketed in the plains states east of the Rocky Mountains, where\r\nit is excellent fence material.\r\n\r\nA larger market is found in manufacturing centers farther east. Western\r\nwhite pine is shipped to Chicago where it is manufactured into doors,\r\nsash, and interior finish, in competition with all other woods in that\r\nmarket. It is said to be of frequent occurrence that the very pine which\r\nis shipped in its rough form out of the Rocky Mountain region goes back\r\nfinished as doors and sash. When the mountain regions shall have better\r\nmanufacturing facilities, this will not occur. In the manufacture of\r\nwindow and hothouse sash, glass is more important than wood, although\r\neach is useless without the other. The principal glass factories are in\r\nthe East, and it is sometimes desirable to ship the wood to the glass\r\nfactory, have the sash made there, and the glazing done; and the\r\nfinished sash, ready for use, may go back to the source of the timber.\r\n\r\nThe same operation is sometimes repeated for doors; but in recent years\r\nthe mountain region where this pine grows has been supplied with\r\nfactories and there is now less shipping of raw material out and of\r\nfinished products back than formerly. The development of the fruit\r\nindustry in the elevated valleys of Idaho, Montana, Washington, and\r\nOregon has called for shipping boxes in large numbers, and western white\r\npine has been found an ideal wood for that use. It is light in weight\r\nand in color, strong enough to satisfy all ordinary requirements, and\r\ncheap enough to bring it within reach of orchardists. It meets with\r\nlively competition from a number of other woods which grow abundantly in\r\nthe region, but it holds its ground and takes its share of the business.\r\n\r\nEstimates of the total stand of western white pine among its native\r\nmountains have not been published, but the quantity is known to be\r\nlarge. It is a difficult species to estimate because it is scattered\r\nwidely, large, pure stands being scarce. Some large mills make a\r\nspecialty of sawing this species. The annual output is believed to reach\r\n150,000,000 feet, most of which is in Idaho and Montana.\r\n\r\nMEXICAN WHITE PINE (_Pinus strobiformis_) is not sufficiently abundant\r\nto be of much importance in the United States. The best of it is south\r\nof the international boundary in Mexico, but the species extends into\r\nNew Mexico and Arizona where it is most abundant at altitudes of from\r\n6,000 to 8,000 feet. The growth is generally scattering, and the trunks\r\nare often deformed through fire injury, and are inclined to be limby and\r\nof poor form. The best trees are from eighty to one hundred feet high,\r\nand two in diameter; but many are scarcely half that size. The lumbermen\r\nof the region, who cut Mexican white pine, are inclined to place low\r\nvalue on it, not because the wood is of poor quality, but because it is\r\nscarce. It is generally sent to market with western yellow pine.\r\nExcellent grades and quality of this wood are shipped into the United\r\nStates from Mexico, but not in large amounts. An occasional carload\r\nreaches door and sash factories in Texas, and woodworkers as far east as\r\nMichigan are acquainted with it, through trials and experiments which\r\nthey have made. It is highly recommended by those who have tried it.\r\nSome consider it as soft, as easy to work, and as free from warping and\r\nchecking as the eastern white pine. In Arizona and New Mexico the tree\r\nis known as ayacahuite pine, white pine, and Arizona white pine. The\r\nwood is moderately light, fairly strong, rather stiff, of slow growth,\r\nand the bands of summerwood are comparatively broad. The resin passages\r\nare few and large. The wood is light red, the sapwood whiter. The leaves\r\noccur in clusters of five, are three or four inches long, and fall\r\nduring the third and fourth years. The seeds are large and have small\r\nwings which cannot carry them far from the parent tree.\r\n\r\nPINON (_Pinus edulis_). This is one of the nut pines abounding among the\r\nwestern mountains, and it is called pinon in Texas, nut pine in Texas\r\nand Colorado, pinon pine and New Mexican pinon in other parts of its\r\nrange, extending from Colorado through New Mexico to western Texas. It\r\nhas two and three leaves to the cluster. They begin to fall the third\r\nyear and continue through six or seven years following. The cones are\r\nquite small, the largest not exceeding one and one-half inches in\r\nlength. Trees are from thirty to forty feet high, and large trunks may\r\nbe two and one-half feet in diameter. The tree runs up mountain sides to\r\naltitudes of 8,000 or 9,000 feet. It exists in rather large bodies, but\r\nis not an important timber tree, because the trunks are short and are\r\ngenerally of poor form. It often branches near the ground and assumes\r\nthe appearance of a large shrub. Ties of pinon have been used with\r\nvarious results. Some have proved satisfactory, others have proved weak\r\nby breaking, and the ties occasionally split when spikes are driven. The\r\nwood’s service as posts varies also. Some posts will last only three or\r\nfour years, while others remain sound a long time. The difference in\r\nlasting properties is due to the difference in resinous contents of the\r\nwood. Few softwoods rank above it in fuel value, and much is cut in some\r\nlocalities. Large areas have been totally stripped for fuel. Charcoal\r\nfor local smithies is burned from this pine. The wood is widely used for\r\nranch purposes, but not in large quantities. The edible nuts are sought\r\nby birds, rodents, and Indians. Some stores keep the nuts for sale. The\r\ntree is handicapped in its effort at reproduction by weight, and the\r\nsmall wing power of the seeds. They fall near the base of the parent\r\ntree, and most of them are speedily devoured.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUGAR PINE\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SUGAR PINE]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUGAR PINE\r\n\r\n(_Pinus Lambertiana_)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the largest pine of the United States, and probably is the\r\nlargest true pine in the world. Its rival, the Kauri pine of New\r\nZealand, is not a pine according to the classification of botanists; and\r\nthat leaves the sugar pine supreme, as far as the world has been\r\nexplored. David Douglas, the first to describe the species, reported a\r\ntree eighteen feet in diameter and 245 feet high, in southern Oregon. No\r\ntree of similar size has been reported since; but trunks six, ten, and\r\neven twelve feet through, and more than 200 high are not rare.\r\n\r\nThe range of sugar pine extends from southern Oregon to lower\r\nCalifornia. Through California it follows the Sierra Nevada mountains in\r\na comparatively narrow belt. In Oregon it descends within 1,000 feet of\r\nsea level, but the lower limit of its range gradually rises as it\r\nfollows the mountains southward, until in southern California it is\r\n8,000 or 10,000 feet above the sea. Its choice of situation is in the\r\nmountain belt where the annual precipitation is forty inches or more.\r\nThe deep winter snows of the Sierras do not hurt it. The young trees\r\nbear abundant limbs covering the trunks nearly or quite to the ground,\r\nand are of perfect conical shape. When they are ten or fifteen feet tall\r\nthey may be entirely covered in snow which accumulates to a depth of a\r\ndozen feet or more. The little pines are seldom injured by the load, but\r\ntheir limbs shed the snow until it covers the highest twig. The\r\nconsequence is that a crooked sugar pine trunk is seldom seen, though a\r\nconsiderable part of the tree’s youth may have been spent under tons of\r\nsnow. Later in life the lower limbs die and drop, leaving clean boles\r\nwhich assure abundance of clear lumber in the years to come.\r\n\r\nThe tree is nearly always known as sugar pine, though it may be called\r\nbig pine or great pine to distinguish it from firs, cedars, and other\r\nsoftwoods with which it is associated. The name is due to a product\r\nresembling sugar which exudes from the heartwood when the tree has been\r\ninjured by fires, and which dries in white, brittle excrescences on the\r\nsurface. Its taste is sweet, with a suggestion of pitch which is not\r\nunpleasant. The principle has been named “pinite.”\r\n\r\nThe needles of sugar pine are in clusters of five and are about four\r\ninches long. They are deciduous the second and third years. The cones\r\nare longer than cones of any other pine of this country but those of the\r\nCoulter pine are a little heavier. Extreme length of 22 inches for the\r\nsugar pine cone has been recorded, but the average is from 12 to 15\r\ninches. Cones open, shed their seeds the second year, and fall the\r\nthird. The seeds resemble lentils, and are provided with wings which\r\ncarry them several hundred feet, if wind is favorable. This affords\r\nexcellent opportunities for reproduction; but there is an offset in the\r\nsweetness of the seeds which are prized for food by birds, beasts and\r\ncreeping things from the Piute Indian down to the Douglas squirrel and\r\nthe jumping mouse.\r\n\r\nSugar pine occupies a high place as a timber tree. It has been in use\r\nfor half a century. The cut in 1900 was 52,000,000 feet, in 1904 it was\r\n120,000,000; in 1907, 115,000,000, and the next year about 100,000,000.\r\nNinety-three per cent of the cut is in California, the rest in Oregon.\r\nIts stand in California has been estimated at 25,000,000,000 feet.\r\n\r\nThe wood of sugar pine is a little lighter than eastern white pine, is a\r\nlittle weaker, and has less stiffness. It is soft, the rings of growth\r\nare wide, the bands of summerwood thin and resinous; the resin passages\r\nare numerous and very large, the medullary rays numerous and obscure.\r\nThe heart is light brown, the sapwood nearly white.\r\n\r\nSugar pine and redwood were the two early roofing woods in California,\r\nand both are still much used for that purpose. Sugar pine was made into\r\nsawed shingles and split shakes. The shingle is a mill product; but the\r\nshake was rived with mallet and frow, and in the years when it was the\r\ngreat roofing material in central and eastern California, the shake\r\nmakers camped by twos in the forest, lived principally on bacon and red\r\nbeans, and split out from 200,000 to 400,000 shakes as a summer’s work.\r\nThe winter snows drove the workers from the mountains, with from eight\r\nto twelve hundred dollars in their pockets for the season’s work.\r\n\r\nThe increase in stumpage price has practically killed the shake maker’s\r\nbusiness. In the palmy days when most everything went, he procured his\r\ntimber for little or nothing. He sometimes failed to find the surveyor’s\r\nlines, particularly if there happened to be a fine sugar pine just\r\nacross on a government quarter section. His method of operation was\r\nwasteful. He used only the best of the tree. If the grain happened to\r\ntwist the fraction of an inch, he abandoned the fallen trunk, and cut\r\nanother. The shakes were split very thin, for sugar pine is among the\r\nmost cleavable woods of this country. Four or five good trees provided\r\nthe shake maker’s camp with material for a year’s work.\r\n\r\nSome of the earliest sawmills in California cut sugar pine for sheds,\r\nshacks, sluiceboxes, flumes among the mines; and almost immediately a\r\ndemand came from the agricultural and stock districts for lumber. From\r\nthat day until the present time the sugar pine mills have been busy. As\r\nthe demand has grown, the facilities for meeting it have increased. The\r\nprevailing size of the timber forbade the use of small mills. A saw\r\nlarge enough for most eastern and southern timbers would not slab a\r\nsugar pine log. From four to six feet were common sizes, and the\r\nlumberman despised anything small.\r\n\r\nIn late years sugar pine operators have looked beyond the local markets,\r\nand have been sending their lumber to practically every state in the\r\nUnion, except probably the extreme South. It comes in direct competition\r\nwith the white pine of New England and the Lake States. The two woods\r\nhave many points of resemblance. The white pine would probably have lost\r\nno markets to the California wood if the best grades could still be had\r\nat moderate prices; but most of the white pine region has been stripped\r\nof its best timber, and the resulting scarcity in the high grades has\r\nbeen, in part, made good by sugar pine. Some manufacturers of doors and\r\nframes claim that sugar pine is more satisfactory than white pine,\r\nbecause of better behavior under climatic changes. It is said to shrink,\r\nswell, and warp less than the eastern wood.\r\n\r\nSugar pine has displaced white pine to a very small extent only, in\r\ncomparison with the field still held by the eastern wood, whose annual\r\noutput is about thirty times that of the California species. Their uses\r\nare practically the same except that only the good grades of sugar pine\r\ngo east, and the corresponding grades of white pine west, and therefore\r\nthere is no competition between the poor grades of the two woods. The\r\nannual demand for sugar and white pine east of the Rocky Mountains is\r\nprobably represented as an average in Illinois, where 2,000,000 feet of\r\nthe former and 175,000,000 of the latter are used yearly.\r\n\r\nWhile there is a large amount of mature sugar pine ready for lumbermen,\r\nthe prospect of future supplies from new growth is not entirely\r\nsatisfactory. The western yellow pine is mixed with it throughout most\r\nof its range, and is more than a match for it in taking possession of\r\nvacant ground. It is inferred from this fact that the relative positions\r\nof the two species in future forests will change at the expense of sugar\r\npine. It endures shade when small, and this enables it to obtain a start\r\namong other species; but as it increases in size it becomes intolerant\r\nof shade, and if it does not receive abundance of light it will not\r\ngrow. A forest fire is nearly certain to kill the small sugar pines, but\r\nold trunks are protected by their thick bark. Few species have fewer\r\nnatural enemies. Very small trees are occasionally attacked by mistletoe\r\n(_Arceuthobium occidentale_) and succumb or else are stunted in their\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\n    MEXICAN PINON (_Pinus cembroides_) is known also as nut pine, pinon\r\n    pine and stone-seed Mexican pinon. It is one of the smallest of the\r\n    native pines of this country. The tree is fifteen or twenty feet\r\n    high and a few inches in diameter, but in sheltered canyons in\r\n    Arizona it sometimes attains a height of fifty or sixty feet with a\r\n    corresponding diameter. It reaches its best development in northern\r\n    Mexico and what is found of it in the United States is the species’\r\n    extreme northern extension, in Arizona and New Mexico at altitudes\r\n    usually above 6,000 feet. It supplies fuel in districts where\r\n    firewood is otherwise scarce, and it has a small place as ranch\r\n    timber. The wood is heavy, of slow growth, the summerwood thin and\r\n    dense. The resin passages are few and small; color, light, clear\r\n    yellow, the sapwood nearly white. If the tree stood in regions\r\n    well-forested with commercial species, it would possess little or no\r\n    value; but where wood is scarce, it has considerable value. The\r\n    hardshell nuts resemble those of the gray pine, but are considered\r\n    more valuable for food. They are not of much importance in the\r\n    United States, but in Mexico where the trees are more abundant and\r\n    the population denser, the nuts are bought and sold in large\r\n    quantities. Its leaves are in clusters of three, sometimes two. They\r\n    are one inch or more in length, and fall the third and fourth years.\r\n    Cones are seldom over two inches in length. The species is not\r\n    extending its range, but seems to be holding the ground it already\r\n    has. It bears abundance of seeds, but not one in ten thousand\r\n    germinates and becomes a mature tree.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHITEBARK PINE\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHITEBARK PINE]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHITEBARK PINE\r\n\r\n(_Pinus Albicaulis_)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis interesting and peculiar pine has a number of names, most of which\r\nare descriptive. The whiteness of the bark and the stunted and recumbent\r\nposition which the tree assumes on bleak mountains are referred to in\r\nthe names whitestem pine in California and Montana, scrub pine in\r\nMontana, whitebark in Oregon, white in California, and elsewhere it is\r\ncreeping pine, whitebark pine, and alpine whitebark pine. It is a\r\nmountain tree. There are few heights within its range which it cannot\r\nreach. Its tough, prostrate branches, in its loftiest situations, may\r\nwhip snow banks nine or ten months of the year, and for the two or three\r\nmonths of summer every starry night deposits its sprinkle of frost upon\r\nthe flowers or cones of this persistent tree. It stands the storms of\r\ncenturies, and lives on, though the whole period of its existence is a\r\nbattle for life under adverse circumstances. At lower altitudes it fares\r\nbetter but does not live longer than on the most sterile peak. Its range\r\ncovers 500,000 square miles, but only in scattered groups. It touches\r\nthe high places only, creeping down to altitudes of 5,000 or 6,000 feet\r\nin the northern Rocky Mountains. It grows from British Columbia to\r\nsouthern California, and is found in Montana, Idaho, Washington, Oregon,\r\nNevada, Arizona, and California. Its associates are the mountain\r\nclimbers of the tree kingdom, Engelmann spruce, Lyall larch, limber\r\npine, alpine fir, foxtail pine, Rocky Mountain juniper, knobcone pine,\r\nand western juniper. Its dark green needles, stout and rigid, are from\r\none and one-half to two and one-half inches long. They hang on the twigs\r\nfrom five to eight years. In July the scarlet flowers appear, forming a\r\nbeautiful contrast with the white bark and the green needles. In August\r\nthe seeds are ripe. The cones are from one and one-half to three inches\r\nlong. The seeds are nearly half an inch long, sweet to the taste. The\r\nfew squirrels and birds which inhabit the inhospitable region where the\r\nwhitebark pine grows, get busy the moment the cones open, and few\r\nescape. Nature seems to have played a prank on this pine by giving wings\r\nto the seeds and rendering their use impossible. The wing is stuck fast\r\nwith resin to the cone scales, and the seed can escape only by tearing\r\nits wing off. The heavy nut then falls plumb to the ground beneath the\r\nbranches of its parent. It might be supposed that a tree situated as the\r\nwhitebark pine is would be provided with ample means of seedflight in\r\norder to afford wide distribution, and give opportunity to survive the\r\nhardships which are imposed by surroundings; but such is not the case.\r\nThe willow and the cottonwood which grow in fertile valleys have the\r\nmeans of scattering their seeds miles away; but this bleak mountain tree\r\nmust drop its seeds on the rocks beneath. In this instance, nature seems\r\nmore interested in depositing the pine nuts where the hungry squirrels\r\ncan get them, than in furnishing a planting place for the nuts\r\nthemselves--therefore, tears off their wings before they leave the cone.\r\nThe battle for existence begins before the seeds germinate, and the\r\nstruggle never ceases. The tree, in parts of its range, survives a\r\ntemperature sixty degrees below zero. Its seedlings frequently perish,\r\nnot from cold and drought, but because the wind thrashes them against\r\nthe rocks which wear them to pieces. Trees which survive on the great\r\nheights are apt to assume strange and fantastic forms, with less\r\nresemblance to trees than to great, green spiders sprawling over the\r\nrocks. Trees 500 years old may not be five feet high. Deep snows hold\r\nthem flat to the rocks so much of the time that the limbs cannot lift\r\nthemselves during the few summer days, but grow like vines. The growth\r\nis so exceedingly slow that the new wood on the tips of twigs at the end\r\nof summer is a mere point of yellow. John Muir, with a magnifying glass,\r\ncounted seventy-five annual rings in a twig one-eighth of an inch in\r\ndiameter. Trunks three and one-half inches in diameter may be 225 years\r\nold; one of six inches had 426 rings; while a seventeen-inch trunk was\r\n800 years old, and less than six feet high. Such a tree has a spread of\r\nbranches thirty or forty feet across. They lie flat on the ground. Wild\r\nsheep, deer, bear, and other wild animals know how to shelter themselves\r\nbeneath the prostrate branches by creeping under; and travelers,\r\novertaken by storms, sometimes do the same; or in good weather the\r\nsheepherder or the hunter may spread his blankets on the mass of limbs,\r\nboughs, and needles, and spend a comfortable night on a springy\r\ncouch--actually sleeping in a tree top within two feet of the ground. In\r\nregions lower down, the whitebark pine reaches respectable tree form.\r\nFence posts are sometimes cut from it in the Mono basin, east of the\r\nSierra Nevada mountains. In the Nez Perce National Forest trees forty\r\nfeet high have merchantable lengths of twenty-four feet. Similar growth\r\nis found in other regions. In its best growth, the wood of whitebark\r\npine resembles that of white pine. It is light, of about the same\r\nstrength as white pine, but more brittle. The annual rings are very\r\nnarrow; the small resin passages are numerous. The sapwood is very thin\r\nand is nearly white. Men can never greatly assist or hinder this tree.\r\nIt will continue to occupy heights and elevated valleys.\r\n\r\nBRISTLECONE PINE (_Pinus aristata_) owes its name to the sharp bristles\r\non the tips of the cone scales. It is known also as foxtail pine and\r\nhickory pine. The latter name is given, not because of toughness, but\r\non account of the whiteness of the sapwood. It is strictly a high\r\nmountain tree, running up to the timber line at 12,000 feet, and seldom\r\noccurring below 6,000 or 7,000 feet. It maintains its existence under\r\nadverse circumstances, its home being on dry, stony ridges, cold and\r\nstormy in winter, and subject to excessive drought during the brief\r\ngrowing season. Trees of large trunks and fine forms are impossible\r\nunder such conditions. The bristlecone pine’s bole is short, tapers\r\nrapidly and is excessively knotty. The species reaches its best\r\ndevelopment in Colorado. Though it is seldom sawed for lumber, it is of\r\nmuch importance in many localities where better material is scarce. In\r\ncentral Nevada many valuable mines were developed and worked by using\r\nthe wood for props and fuel. Charcoal made of it was particularly\r\nimportant in that region, and it was carried long distances to supply\r\nblacksmith shops in mining camps. Railways have made some use of it for\r\nties. Though rough, it is liked for fence posts. The resin in the wood\r\nassists in resisting decay, and posts last many years in the dry regions\r\nwhere the tree grows. Ranchmen among the high mountains build corrals,\r\npens, sheds, and fences of it; but the fibers of the wood are so twisted\r\nand involved that splitting is nearly impossible, and round timbers only\r\nare employed. The bristlecone pine can never be more important in the\r\ncountry’s lumber supply than it is now. It occupies waste land where no\r\nother tree grows, and it crowds out nothing better than itself. It\r\nclings to stony peaks and wind-swept ridges where the ungainly trunks\r\nare welcome to the traveler, miner, or sheepherder who is in need of a\r\nshed to shelter him, or a fire for his night camp. In situations exposed\r\nto great cold and drying winds, the bristlecone pine is a shrub, with\r\nlittle suggestion of a tree, further than its green foliage and small\r\ncones. The needles are in clusters of five. They cling to the twigs for\r\nten or fifteen years. The seeds are scattered about the first of\r\nOctober, and the wind carries them hundreds of feet. They take root in\r\nsoil so sterile that no humus is visible. Young trees and the small\r\ntwigs of old ones present a peculiar appearance. The bark is chalky\r\nwhite, but when the trees are old the bark becomes red or brown.\r\n\r\n    FOXTAIL PINE (_Pinus balfouriana_) owes its name to the clustering\r\n    of its needles round the ends of the branches, bristling like a\r\n    fox’s tail. The needles are seldom more than one and one-half inches\r\n    in length, and are in clusters of fives. They cling to the branches\r\n    ten or fifteen years before falling. The cones are about three\r\n    inches long, and are armed with slender spines. The tree is strictly\r\n    a mountain species and grows at a higher altitude than any other\r\n    tree in the United States, although whitebark pine is not much\r\n    behind it. It reaches its best development near Mt. Whitney,\r\n    California, where it is said to grow at an altitude of 15,000 feet\r\n    above sea level. It has been officially reported at Farewell Gap, in\r\n    the Sierra Nevada mountains, at an altitude of 13,000. At high\r\n    altitudes it is scrubby and distorted, but in more favorable\r\n    situations it may be sixty feet high and two in diameter. On high\r\n    mountains it is generally not more than thirty feet high and ten\r\n    inches in diameter. It is of remarkably slow growth, and\r\n    comparatively small trees may be 200 or 300 years old. The wood is\r\n    moderately light, is soft, weak, brittle. Resin passages are few and\r\n    very small. The wood is satiny and susceptible of a good polish, and\r\n    would be valuable if abundant. The seeds are winged and the wind\r\n    scatters them widely, but most of them are lost on barren rocks or\r\n    drifts of eternal snow. The untoward circumstances under which the\r\n    tree must live prevent generous reproduction. It holds its own but\r\n    can gain no new foothold on the bleak and barren heights which form\r\n    its environment. The dark green of its foliage makes the belts of\r\n    foxtail pines conspicuous where they grow above the timber line of\r\n    nearly all other trees. Its range is confined to a few of the\r\n    highest mountains of California, particularly about (but not on) Mt.\r\n    Shasta and among the clusters of peaks about the sources of Kings\r\n    and Kern rivers. Those who travel and camp among the highest\r\n    mountains of California are often indebted to foxtail pine for their\r\n    fuel. Near the upper limit of its range it frequently dies at the\r\n    top, and stands stripped of bark for many years. The dead wood,\r\n    which frequently is not higher above the ground than a man’s head,\r\n    is broken away by campers for fuel, and it is often the only\r\n    resource.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLONGLEAF PINE\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LONGLEAF PINE]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLONGLEAF PINE\r\n\r\n(_Pinus Palustris_)\r\n\r\n\r\nLongleaf is generally considered to be the most important member of the\r\ngroup of hard or pitch pines in this country[2]. It is known by many\r\nnames in different parts of its range, and outside of its range where\r\nthe wood is well known.\r\n\r\n    [2] There is no precise agreement as to what should be included in\r\n    the group of hard pines in the United States, but the following\r\n    twenty-two are usually placed in that class: Longleaf Pine (_Pinus\r\n    palustris_), Shortleaf Pine (_Pinus echinata_), Loblolly Pine\r\n    (_Pinus tæda_), Cuban Pine (_Pinus heterophylla_), Norway Pine\r\n    (_Pinus resinosa_), Western Yellow Pine (_Pinus ponderosa_),\r\n    Chihuahua Pine (_Pinus chihuahuana_), Arizona Pine (_Pinus\r\n    arizonica_), Pitch Pine (_Pinus rigida_), Pond Pine (_Pinus\r\n    serotina_), Spruce Pine (_Pinus glabra_), Monterey Pine (_Pinus\r\n    radiata_), Knobcone Pine (_Pinus attenuata_), Gray Pine (_Pinus\r\n    sabiniana_), Coulter Pine (_Pinus coulteri_), Lodgepole Pine (_Pinus\r\n    contorta_), Jack Pine (_Pinus divaricata_), Scrub Pine (_Pinus\r\n    virginiana_), Sand Pine (_Pinus clausa_), Table Mountain Pine\r\n    (_Pinus pungens_), California Swamp Pine (_Pinus muricata_), Torry\r\n    Pine (_Pinus torreyana_).\r\n\r\nThe names southern pine, Georgia pine, and Florida pine are not well\r\nchosen, because there are other important pines in the regions named.\r\nTurpentine pine is a common term, but other species produce turpentine\r\nalso, particularly the Cuban pine. Hard pine is much employed in\r\nreference to this tree, and it applies well, but it describes other\r\nspecies also. Heart pine is a lumberman’s term to distinguish this\r\nspecies from loblolly, shortleaf, and Cuban pines. The sapwood of the\r\nthree last named is thick, the heartwood small, while in longleaf pine\r\nthe sap is thin, the heart large, hence the name applied by lumbermen.\r\nIn Tennessee where it is not a commercial forest tree, it is called\r\nbrown pine, and in nearly all parts of the United States it is spoken of\r\nas yellow pine, usually with some adjective as “southern,” “Georgia,” or\r\n“longleaf.” The persistency with which Georgia is used as a portion of\r\nthe name of this tree is due to the fact that extensive lumbering of the\r\nlongleaf forests began in that state. The center of operations has since\r\nshifted to the West, and is now in Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas.\r\nThe tree has many other names, among them being pitch pine and fat pine.\r\nThese have reference to its value in the naval stores industry. The name\r\nlongleaf pine is now well established in commercial transactions. It has\r\nlonger leaves than any other pine in this country. They range in length\r\nfrom eight to eighteen inches. The needles of Cuban pine are from eight\r\nto twelve inches; loblolly’s are from six to nine; and those of\r\nshortleaf from three to five.\r\n\r\nLongleaf pine’s geographic range is more restricted than that of\r\nloblolly and shortleaf, but larger than the range of Cuban pine.\r\nLongleaf occupies a belt from Virginia to Texas, following the tertiary\r\nsandy formation pretty closely. The belt seldom extends from the coast\r\ninland more than 125 miles. The tree runs south in Florida to Tampa bay.\r\nIt disappears as it approaches the Mississippi, but reappears west of\r\nthat river in Louisiana and Texas. Its western limit is near Trinity\r\nriver, and its northern in that region is near the boundary between\r\nLouisiana and Arkansas.\r\n\r\nLongleaf attains a height of from sixty to ninety feet, but a few trees\r\nreach 130. The diameters of mature trunks range from one foot to three,\r\nusually less than two. The leaves grow three in a bundle, and fall at\r\nthe end of the second year. They are arranged in thick, broom-like\r\nbunches on the ends of the twigs. It is a tree of slow growth compared\r\nwith other pines of the region. Its characteristic narrow annual rings\r\nare usually sufficient to distinguish its logs and lumber from those of\r\nother southern yellow pines. Its thin sapwood likewise assists in\r\nidentification. The proportionately high percentage of heartwood in\r\nlongleaf pine makes it possible to saw lumber which shows little or no\r\nsapwood. It is difficult to do that with other southern pines.\r\n\r\nThe wood is heavy, exceedingly hard for pine, very strong, tough,\r\ncompact, durable, resinous, resin passages few, not conspicuous;\r\nmedullary rays numerous, not conspicuous; color, light red or orange,\r\nthe thin sapwood nearly white. The annual rings contain a large\r\nproportion of dark colored summerwood, which accounts for the great\r\nstrength of longleaf pine timber. The contrast in color between the\r\nspringwood and the summerwood is the basis of the figure of this pine\r\nwhich gives it much of its value as an interior finish material,\r\nincluding doors. The hardness of the summerwood provides the wearing\r\nqualities of flooring and paving blocks. The coloring matter in the body\r\nof the wood protects it against decay for a longer period than most\r\nother pines. This, in connection with its hardness and strength, gives\r\nit high standing for railroad ties, bridges, trestles, and other\r\nstructures exposed to weather.\r\n\r\nLongleaf pine is as widely used as any softwood in this country. It\r\nserves with hardwoods for a number of purposes. It has been a timber of\r\ncommerce since an early period, and was exported from the south Atlantic\r\ncoast long before the Revolutionary war; but it was later than that when\r\nit came into keen competition with the Riga pine of northern Europe. It\r\nhas since held its own in the European markets, and its trade has\r\nextended to many other foreign countries, particularly to the republics\r\nof South and Central America, Mexico, and the West Indies.\r\n\r\nIt did not attain an important position in the commerce of this country\r\nuntil after the Civil war, but it had a place in shipbuilding before\r\nthat time, and it has held that place. The builders of cars employ large\r\nquantities for frames and other parts of gondolas, box cars, and\r\ncoaches. Over 175,000,000 feet were so used in 1909 in Illinois. It is\r\nthe leading car building timber in this country. Its great strength,\r\nhardness, and stiffness give it that place.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely less important as an interior wood for house finish. It\r\nis not so much its strength as its beauty that recommends it for that\r\npurpose. Its beauty is due to a combination of figure and color.\r\nSplendid variety is possible by carefully selecting the material.\r\nManufacturers of furniture, fixtures, and vehicles are large users of\r\nlongleaf pine. In these lines its chief value is due to strength.\r\n\r\nIn the naval stores industry in this country, it is more important than\r\nall other species combined. For a century and a half it has supplied\r\nthis country and much of the rest of the world. The principal\r\ncommodities made from the resin of this tree are spirits of turpentine\r\nand rosin. These two articles are produced by distilling the resin which\r\nexudes from wounds in the tree. The distillate is spirits of turpentine,\r\nthe residue is rosin. The manufacture of naval stores has destroyed tens\r\nof thousands of trees in the past; but better methods are now in use and\r\nloss is less. Georgia and South Carolina were once the center of naval\r\nstores production; but it has now moved to Louisiana and Florida.\r\n\r\nThe supply of longleaf pine has rapidly decreased during the past twenty\r\nyears, and though the end is not yet at hand, it is approaching. Young\r\ntrees are not coming on to take the place of those cut for lumber. They\r\ngrow slowly at best, and a new forest could not be produced in less than\r\na hundred years. Both protection and care have been lacking. Fire\r\nusually kills seedlings in their first or second year. The result is\r\nthat many extensive tracts where longleaf pine once grew in abundance\r\nhave few young and scarcely any old trees now. As far as can be\r\nforeseen, this valuable timber will reach its end when existing stands\r\nhave been cut.\r\n\r\nCUBAN PINE (_Pinus heterophylla_). The Cuban pine has several local\r\nnames; slash pine in Georgia, Florida, Alabama, and Mississippi; swamp\r\npine in Florida, Alabama, and Mississippi; meadow pine in Florida and\r\nMississippi; pitch pine in Florida; and spruce pine in Alabama. Its\r\nrange is confined to the coast region from South Carolina to Louisiana,\r\nfrom sixty to one hundred miles inland. It is the only pine in the\r\nextreme south of Florida. The wood is heavy, hard, very strong, tough,\r\ncompact, durable, resinous, the resin passages few but conspicuous, rich\r\ndark orange color, the sapwood often nearly white. The annual ring is\r\nusually more than half dark colored summerwood. The Cuban pine grows\r\nrapidly, quickly appropriates vacant ground, and the species is\r\nspreading. Its needles, from eight to twelve inches long, fall the\r\nsecond year. The wood possesses nearly the strength, hardness, and\r\nstiffness of longleaf pine, and the trunks are as large. The two woods\r\nwhich are so similar in other respects differ in figure, owing to the\r\nwider annual rings of the Cuban pine. The sapwood of the latter species\r\ngreatly exceeds in thickness that of longleaf pine. For that reason it\r\nis often mistaken for loblolly pine. Cuban pine never goes to market\r\nunder its own name, but is mixed with and passes for one of the other\r\nsouthern yellow pines.\r\n\r\nSAND PINE (_Pinus clausa_). This tree is generally twenty or thirty feet\r\nhigh, and eight or twelve inches in diameter. Under favorable conditions\r\nit attains a height of sixty or eighty feet and a diameter of two. The\r\nleaves are two or three inches long, and fall the third and fourth\r\nyears. Its range is almost wholly in Florida but extends a little over\r\nthe northern border. It grows as far south as Tampa on the west coast,\r\nand nearly to Miami on the east. It is not much cut for lumber because\r\nof its small size and generally short, limby trunk. In a few localities\r\nshapely boles are developed, and serviceable lumber is made. It is a\r\npoor-land tree, as its name implies. The cones adhere to the branches\r\nmany years, and may be partly enclosed in the growing wood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSHORTLEAF PINE\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHORTLEAF PINE]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSHORTLEAF PINE\r\n\r\n(_Pinus Echinata_)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the markets the lumber of this species is known as yellow pine,\r\nsouthern yellow pine, and sap pine, and in some localities the term\r\nshortleaf is used. The latter is descriptive, and can be easily\r\nunderstood when reference is made to the living tree, because its short\r\nneedles distinguish it from its associates in the pine forest; but in\r\nspeaking of lumber only, the reference to the leaves has less meaning,\r\nparticularly to one who is not acquainted with the tree’s appearance.\r\nIts wood so closely resembles that of Cuban and loblolly pine that they\r\nare not easily distinguished by sight alone. In the East the name\r\nCarolina pine or North Carolina pine is much used, but it is not often\r\nheard west of the Allegheny mountains. Referring to the manner and\r\nlocality of its growth it is called slash pine in North Carolina and\r\nVirginia, old-field pine in Alabama and Mississippi, and poor-field pine\r\nin Florida. Its tendency to take possession of abandoned ground has\r\ngiven it these names. It is occasionally called pitch pine in Missouri.\r\nThat name would not distinguish it in most parts of the South where\r\nseveral species of pitch pine grow. In some regions it is known as\r\nspruce pine, but the name is not based on any characteristic of the\r\nliving tree or of its wood. In North Carolina and Alabama, and in\r\nliterature, it is sometimes known as rosemary pine, but that name\r\napplies rather to fine timber cut from any southern yellow pine, than to\r\nthis species in particular. In Delaware it is known as shortshat and in\r\nVirginia as bull pine. To those who are familiar with the tree’s\r\nappearance, the name shortleaf pine is most accurate in definition.\r\n\r\nThe commercial range of shortleaf pine has contracted to a considerable\r\nextent since the settlement of the country. It once grew as far north as\r\nAlbany, New York, and from fifty to a hundred years ago it was lumbered\r\nin Pennsylvania, Maryland, and West Virginia in regions where it has now\r\nceased to exist, or is found only as scattered trees. Its geographical\r\nrange is now usually given from New York to Florida, west to Missouri\r\nand Oklahoma and northeastern Texas. It is important in lumber\r\noperations in North Carolina and southward, and westward to the limits\r\nof its range. The tree reaches its largest size and attains its finest\r\nstands west of the Mississippi river. In average size it exceeds\r\nlongleaf pine. It may reach a height above 100 feet and a trunk diameter\r\nof three or four. Squared timbers of large size were formerly exported\r\nfrom Virginia and North Carolina. Similar sizes cannot now be procured\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nShortleaf pine varies greatly in the quality and amount of sapwood. It\r\nis normally a thick sap tree, but midway between loblolly and longleaf.\r\nThe young tree increases rapidly in size until it is from six to ten\r\ninches in diameter, and the yearly rings are wide. The rate of growth\r\nthen decreases and during the rest of its life the rings are narrow.\r\nThis feature is often of assistance in identifying southern yellow pine\r\nlogs or large timbers which contain the heart and also the sap. Wide\r\nrings near the heart, followed by narrow ones, and a thick sapwood are\r\npretty good evidence that the timber--if a southern yellow pine--is\r\nshortleaf pine. The rule is not absolute; for a high authority on timber\r\nhas said that no infallible rule can be laid down for distinguishing by\r\nsight alone the woods of the four southern yellow pines--longleaf,\r\nshortleaf, Cuban, and loblolly.\r\n\r\nThe wood of shortleaf pine is strong, heavy, hard, and compact; very\r\nresinous, resin passages large and numerous; medullary rays numerous,\r\nconspicuous; color, orange, the sapwood nearly white. The thoroughly\r\nseasoned wood weighs thirty-eight pounds per cubic foot. It is about\r\nfive pounds heavier than loblolly pine, five pounds lighter than\r\nlongleaf, and nearly nine pounds lighter than Cuban pine. There is so\r\ngreat a variation in weight of shortleaf pine that only general averages\r\nhave value.\r\n\r\nShortleaf pine is not as strong as longleaf, and is not so extensively\r\nemployed in heavy structural work, but in certain other lines it has the\r\nadvantage of longleaf. It is softer, and door and sash makers like it\r\nbetter. It is easier to work, and when manufactured into doors and\r\ninterior finish many consider it superior to longleaf. The wide rings of\r\nannual growth in the heartwood show fine contrast in color, and when\r\nthese are developed by stains and fillers, the grain or figure of the\r\nwood is very pleasing. Where hardness is not an essential, it is much\r\nused for floors. It is in great demand by builders of freight cars, but\r\nless for frames and heavy beams than for siding and decking. Car\r\nbuilders in Illinois bought 77,000,000 feet of it in 1909. That was\r\nnearly half of the entire quantity of this wood used in the state. The\r\nsecond largest users in Illinois were manufacturers of sash, doors,\r\nblinds, and general millwork. If the whole country is considered, this\r\nis probably the largest use of the wood. Makers of boxes and crates in\r\nthe South employ large quantities.\r\n\r\nThe depletion of shortleaf forests has progressed rapidly, but in the\r\nabsence of reliable statistics it is impossible to give figures by\r\ndecades or years. In 1880 an estimate placed the amount west of the\r\nMississippi at 95,000,000,000 feet. That was probably less than half of\r\nthe country’s supply at that time. In 1911 the Commissioner of\r\nCorporations estimated that the combined remaining stand of loblolly\r\nand shortleaf pine in the South was 152,000,000,000 feet. It is doubtful\r\nif half of it was shortleaf. In that case, there was less shortleaf pine\r\nin the entire South in 1911 than there was west of the Mississippi river\r\nthirty years before.\r\n\r\nRapid decrease in total stand of a species does not necessarily imply\r\nexhaustion. The cut will fall off as scarcity pinches. In the case of\r\nshortleaf pine, an influence is active which will bring good results in\r\nthe future. This pine reproduces with vigor. Its small triangular seeds\r\nare equipped with wings which carry them into vacant areas where they\r\nquickly germinate if they fall on mineral soil. The seedling trees\r\nsuffer much from fire, but their power of resistance is fairly good, and\r\ndense new growth is coming on in many localities. A good many years are\r\nrequired to bring a seedling to maturity, but it will reach sawlog size\r\nsometime, and there is no question but that the market will welcome it.\r\n\r\nThe shortleaf pine is peculiar among eastern softwoods in one respect.\r\nStumps will sprout. That occurs oftener west of the Mississippi than\r\neast. However, the tree’s ability to send up sprouts from the stump is\r\nof little practical value, since the sprouts seldom or never develop\r\ninto merchantable trees. In that respect it differs from the other\r\nwell-known sprouting softwood of this country, the California redwood,\r\nwhose numerous sprouts grow into large trunks.\r\n\r\nSPRUCE PINE (_Pinus glabra_). This is one of the softest and the whitest\r\nof the hard pines of this country. Nothing but its scarcity stands in\r\nthe way of its becoming an important timber tree. The best of it is a\r\nsatisfactory substitute for white pine in the manufacture of doors. It\r\ngrows rapidly, and the wide rings contain a high percentage of light\r\ncolored springwood, though there is enough summerwood of darker color to\r\ngive the dressed lumber a character. It weighs about the same as\r\nnorthern white pine, but is weaker. In South Carolina and Florida it is\r\ncalled white pine, but the name spruce is more general. It is known also\r\nas kingstree, poor pine, Walter’s pine, and lowland spruce pine. Its\r\nrange is restricted to southern South Carolina, northern Florida and\r\nsouthern Alabama and Mississippi, and northeastern Louisiana. Its leaves\r\nare from one and a half to three inches in length, grow two in a bundle,\r\nand fall the second and third years. Large and well-formed trunks attain\r\na height of from eighty to 100 feet and a diameter from two to nearly\r\nthree. It reaches its best development in northwestern Florida, and its\r\nlight, symmetrical trunks have long been in use there as masts for small\r\nvessels. It is too scarce to attract much attention from lumbermen, but\r\nthey are well acquainted with its good qualities, and some of them take\r\npains to keep the lumber separate from associated pines, and sell it to\r\nmanufacturers of doors and interior finish. The bark bears considerable\r\nresemblance to spruce, which probably accounts for the name of the tree.\r\n\r\n    TABLE MOUNTAIN PINE (_Pinus pungens_). The French botanist, Michaux\r\n    the younger, has been criticized for the statement which he made\r\n    more than a hundred years ago that this species was confined to a\r\n    certain flat-topped mountain in the southern Appalachian ranges, and\r\n    he called it table mountain pine. It lacked much of being confined\r\n    within the narrow limits where it was discovered. It grows in New\r\n    Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, District of Columbia, Virginia, West\r\n    Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, North Carolina, and Georgia. Its\r\n    other names are prickly pine, hickory pine, and southern mountain\r\n    pine. It supplies timber in all parts of its range, but, except in\r\n    very restricted localities, it is not abundant. The lumber in the\r\n    market is seldom distinguished from other pines, but some of the\r\n    Tennessee mills sell it separately to local customers. The wood is\r\n    medium light, rather strong (about like _Pinus rigida_, or pitch\r\n    pine, which it resembles in other respects), is less stiff than\r\n    white pine, and is resinous. The thick sapwood is nearly white, the\r\n    heartwood brown. It is not a durable timber in contact with the\r\n    ground. Its fuel value is low. Its needles grow in clusters of two,\r\n    and are generally less than two inches long. The cones which are in\r\n    clusters of from three to eight, and from two to three and a half\r\n    inches long, are armed with stout, curved hooks. The cones shed\r\n    their seeds irregularly during two or three years, and sometimes\r\n    hang on the trees for twenty years. In open ground this pine\r\n    occasionally produces fertile seeds when only a few feet high. Its\r\n    forest form and open-ground form are quite different. In thick woods\r\n    the tree is tall, with good bole, but in open ground it is only\r\n    twenty or thirty feet high, and is covered with limbs almost to the\r\n    ground.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLOBLOLLY PINE\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LOBLOLLY PINE]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLOBLOLLY PINE\r\n\r\n(_Pinus Tæda_)\r\n\r\n\r\nFew trees have more names than this. The names, however, may be\r\nseparated into groups, one group referring to the foliage, another to\r\nthe situations in which the tree grows, and a third to certain\r\ncharacters or uses of the wood. Names descriptive of the leaves are\r\nlongschat pine, longshucks pine, shortleaf pine, foxtail pine, and\r\nlongstraw pine. The names which refer to locality or situation are\r\nloblolly pine, old-field pine, slash pine, black slash pine, Virginia\r\npine, meadow pine and swamp pine. Names which refer to the character of\r\nthe wood or of the standing tree are torch pine, rosemary pine,\r\nfrankincense pine, cornstalk pine, spruce pine, and yellow pine. Not one\r\nof these names is applied to the tree in its entire range, and it has\r\nseveral names other than those listed. Sap pine is widely applied to the\r\nlumber, because the tree’s sapwood is very thick, sometimes amounting to\r\neighty per cent of a trunk. It has borne the name old-field pine for a\r\nhundred and fifty years in Virginia, and the name suggests a good deal\r\nof history. Some of the improvident early Virginia tobacco growers\r\nneglected to fertilize their fields, and the land wore out under\r\nconstant cropping, and was abandoned. The pine quickly took possession,\r\nfor the fields which were too far exhausted to produce tobacco or corn\r\nwere amply able to grow dense stands of loblolly pine, and the farmers\r\nnoticing this, called it old-field pine. It has been taking possession\r\nof abandoned fields in Virginia and North Carolina ever since, and the\r\nname still applies. The tree grows from New Jersey to Florida, west to\r\nTexas, north to Oklahoma, Tennessee, and West Virginia, but it does not\r\ncover the whole territory thus outlined. It is very scarce near its\r\nnorthern limit. There is evidence that the range of loblolly has\r\nextended in historic times, not into new or distant regions, but outside\r\nthe borders which once marked its range. Since white men in Texas\r\nstopped the Indians’ grass fires, the pine has encroached upon the\r\nprairie. Early writers in Virginia and North Carolina spoke of pine as\r\nscarce or totally wanting, except on the immediate coast. It is now\r\nfound from one hundred to two hundred miles inland, and many sawmills\r\nnow cut logs which have grown in fields abandoned since the\r\nRevolutionary war. This has occurred on the Atlantic coast rather than\r\nwest of the Appalachian ranges of mountains. Virginia has more sawmills\r\nthan any other state, and many of them are working on loblolly pine\r\nwhich has grown in the last hundred years.\r\n\r\nThe tree bears seeds abundantly and scatters them widely. It is\r\nvigorous, grows with great rapidity, and is able to fight its way if it\r\nfinds conditions in any way favorable. Turpentine operators have not\r\nfound the working of loblolly pine profitable, and this has relieved it\r\nof a drain which has done much to deplete the southern forests of\r\nlongleaf pine.\r\n\r\nLoblolly’s leaves are from six to nine inches long, and fall the third\r\nyear. This species, in common with other southern yellow pines, is\r\ndisposed to grow tall, clear trunks, with a meager supply of limbs and\r\nfoliage at the top. The lumber sawed from trunks of that kind is clear\r\nof knots. No other important forest tree of the United States comes as\r\nnearly being a cultivated tree as the loblolly pine. This is\r\nparticularly true in the northeastern part of its range, in North\r\nCarolina, Virginia, and Maryland. Though nature has done the actual\r\nplanting, men provided the seed beds by giving up old fields to that\r\nuse; and many of the stands are as thick and even as if they had been\r\nplanted and cared for by regular forestry methods. Trees are from eighty\r\nto one hundred feet tall, and from two to four in diameter, some very\r\nold ones being a little larger.\r\n\r\nThe annual rings of loblolly pine are broad, with good contrast between\r\nthe spring and summer growth. The wood is light, not strong, brittle,\r\nnot durable, very resinous, the resin passages are few and not\r\nconspicuous; medullary rays are numerous and obscure; color, light\r\nbrown, the thick sapwood orange or nearly white. When this tree is of\r\nslow growth it is lighter, less resinous, and has thinner sapwood. It is\r\nsometimes known as rosemary pine.\r\n\r\nThe use of loblolly pine lumber was greatly stimulated when the custom\r\nof drying it in kilns became general. It is largely sapwood and dries\r\nslowly in air. Its market is found in all eastern and central parts of\r\nthe United States, and it is exported to Europe and Central and South\r\nAmerica. It is a substantial material for many common purposes and its\r\nuse is very large on the Atlantic coast. In quantity it exceeds any\r\nother species in the wood-using industries of Maryland, and all others\r\ncombined in North Carolina. It is not as often employed in heavy\r\nstructural timbers as longleaf pine, but in the market of which\r\nBaltimore is the center, much use is made of it for that purpose. It is\r\nten pounds a cubic foot lighter than longleaf, has about three-fourths\r\nof the strength, and nearly four-fifths of longleaf’s elasticity. It is\r\nthus seen to be considerably inferior to it as a structural timber where\r\nheavy loads must be sustained; but builders use it for many purposes in\r\npreference to or on an equality with longleaf. It is fine for interior\r\nfinish and doors. Railroads employ large quantities in building freight\r\ncars, much for crossties, and bridge builders find many places for it.\r\nIt is not a long lasting wood when exposed to weather, unless it has\r\nbeen treated with creosote to preserve it from decay. It is one of the\r\nmost easily treated woods.\r\n\r\nIn North Carolina and Virginia loblolly tobacco hogsheads are common;\r\nand box factories within easy reach of it use much. A list of its uses,\r\ncompiled from reports of factory operations in Maryland, will give an\r\nidea of the range it covers: Basket bottoms, beer bottle boxes, boats,\r\ncart bodies, crates, flooring, frames for doors and windows, fruit\r\nboxes, interior finish, nail kegs, oyster boxes, seats for boats, siding\r\nfor houses, staves for slack cooperage, store fixtures, wagon beds,\r\nbalusters, brackets, chiffoniers, mantels, molding, picture frames,\r\nstair railing, sash, scrollwork, sideboards, tables.\r\n\r\nThe amount of loblolly pine timber in this country is not known. No\r\nother important species comes so near growing as much as is cut from\r\nyear to year. It covers 200,000 square miles with stands ranging from\r\nlittle or nothing in some parts to 20,000 feet per acre in others, or\r\nmore in exceptional cases. The area of fully stocked loblolly pine is\r\nbelieved to be as large now as it ever was. Before the Civil war it was\r\npredicted that its period of greatest production was over; but large\r\ntracts are now being logged on which the pine seeds had not been sown in\r\n1860.\r\n\r\nPOND PINE (_Pinus serotina_). Sargent’s table of weights of woods shows\r\nthis to be the heaviest pine of the United States; but, as his\r\ncalculations were made from a single sample which grew in Duval county,\r\nFlorida, further data should be secured before his figures, 49.5 pounds\r\nper cubic foot, are accepted as an average weight for the species. It is\r\nrated in strength about equal to longleaf and Cuban pine. Its structure\r\nshows a large percentage of dense summerwood in the yearly ring. The\r\nleaves are in clusters of three, rarely four, and are six or eight\r\ninches long, and fall in their third and fourth years. The name suggests\r\nthat the cones are tightly closed, and that they adhere tenaciously to\r\nthe twigs on which they grow. This is found true. The principal\r\nimpression made on a person who sees the pond pine for the first time is\r\nthat it is overloaded with cones, and that it must be a prolific seeder.\r\nBetter acquaintance modifies the latter part of that impression. It is\r\noverloaded with cones, but most of them are many years old, and have\r\nlong been seedless, although most of the trees have the seed crops of\r\ntwo years on the branches at one time. Enough seed is shed to perpetuate\r\nthe species, but too little to insure an aggressive spread into\r\nsurrounding vacant ground. The pond pine may reach a diameter of three\r\nfeet and a height of eighty, but that is twice the average size. The\r\nwood is very resinous, and is brittle.\r\n\r\n    SCRUB PINE (_Pinus virginiana_). This tree is often called Jersey\r\n    pine because it is a prominent feature of the landscapes in the\r\n    southern part of that state where it has spread extensively since\r\n    the settlement of the country. Its short needles have been\r\n    responsible for several of its names, among them being shortshuck\r\n    pine in Maryland and Virginia, shortshat pine in Delaware,\r\n    shortleaved pine in North Carolina, and spruce pine and cedar pine\r\n    in some parts of the South. In Tennessee it is known as nigger pine,\r\n    and in some parts of North Carolina as river pine. The range is\r\n    fairly well outlined by the above discussion of its names. It grows\r\n    from New York to South Carolina, and west of the mountains it is\r\n    found in northern Alabama and middle Tennessee, in Kentucky and West\r\n    Virginia. It reaches its largest size in southern Indiana where it\r\n    is sometimes 100 feet high and three in diameter. It is there a\r\n    valuable tree for many purposes, but is not abundant. Its average\r\n    size is small in the eastern states, usually not over fifty feet\r\n    high, and often little more than half of that. Few trunks east of\r\n    the Allegheny mountains are more than eighteen inches in diameter.\r\n    The name scrub pine is an index to the opinions held by most people\r\n    regarding this tree. It is often considered an encumbrance rather\r\n    than an asset; yet statistics of wood-using industries hardly\r\n    justify that view. Millions of feet of it are employed annually in\r\n    each of the states of New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia, and North\r\n    Carolina, for boxes, slack cooperage, and common lumber. The wood is\r\n    moderately strong, but is not stiff. It is medium light, soft,\r\n    brittle, with summerwood narrow and very resinous. Its color is\r\n    light orange or yellow, the thick sapwood ivory white. The needles\r\n    are from one and a half to three inches long, and fall in the third\r\n    and fourth years. Cones are two or three inches long, and scatter\r\n    their seeds in autumn. The wings are too small to carry the seeds\r\n    far, yet the tree succeeds in quickly spreading into surrounding\r\n    vacant spaces. Cones adhere to the branches three or four years. Tar\r\n    makers and charcoal burners utilized scrub pine in New Jersey,\r\n    northeastern Maryland and southeastern Pennsylvania a century and a\r\n    half ago. The tree seems to be as abundant now as it ever was.\r\n    Unless it occupies very poor land--which it generally does--the\r\n    growth is liable to be suppressed and crowded to death by broadleaf\r\n    trees before the stands become very old. As a species, it is weak in\r\n    self-defense, and it owes its survival to its habit of retreating to\r\n    poor soils where enemies cannot follow. It may be said of it as the\r\n    Roman historian Tacitus said of certain men: “The cowards fly the\r\n    farthest, and are the longest survivors.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNORWAY PINE\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NORWAY PINE]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNORWAY PINE\r\n\r\n(_Pinus Resinosa_)\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly explorers who were not botanists mistook this tree for Norway\r\nspruce, and gave it the name which has since remained in nearly all\r\nparts of its range. It is called red pine also, and this name is\r\nstrictly descriptive. The brown or red color of the bark is instantly\r\nnoticed by one who sees the tree for the first time. In the Lake States\r\nit has been called hard pine for the purpose of distinguishing it from\r\nthe softer white pine with which it is associated. In England they call\r\nit Canadian red pine, because the principal supply in England is\r\nimported from the Canadian provinces.\r\n\r\nIts chief range lies in the drainage basin of the St. Lawrence river,\r\nwhich includes the Great Lakes and the rivers which flow into them.\r\nNewfoundland forms the eastern and Manitoba the western outposts of this\r\nspecies. It is found as far south as Massachusetts, Pennsylvania,\r\nnorthern Ohio, central Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota. It conforms\r\npretty generally to the range of white pine but does not accompany that\r\nspecies southward along the Appalachian mountain ranges across West\r\nVirginia, Virginia, Kentucky, and Tennessee. Where it was left to\r\ncompete in nature’s way with white pine, the contest was friendly, but\r\nwhite pine got the best of it. The two species grew in intermixture, but\r\nin most instances white pine had from five to twenty trees to Norway’s\r\none. As a survivor under adversity, however, the Norway pine appears to\r\nsurpass its great friendly rival, at least in the Lake States where the\r\ngreat pineries once flourished and have largely passed away. Solitary or\r\nsmall clumps of Norway pines are occasionally found where not a white\r\npine, large or small, is in sight.\r\n\r\nThe forest appearance of Norway pine resembles the southern yellow\r\npines. The stand is open, the trunks are clean and tall, the branches\r\nare at the top. The Norway’s leaves are in clusters of two, and are five\r\nor six inches long. They fall during the fourth or fifth year. Cones are\r\ntwo inches long, and when mature, closely resemble the color of the\r\ntree’s bark, that is, light chestnut brown. Exceptionally tall Norway\r\npines may reach a height of 150 feet, but the average is seventy or\r\neighty, with diameters of from two to four. Young trees are limby, but\r\nearly in life the lower branches die and fall, leaving few protruding\r\nstubs or knots. It appears to be a characteristic that trunks are seldom\r\nquite straight. They do not have the plumb appearance of forest grown\r\nwhite pine and spruce.\r\n\r\nThe wood of Norway pine is medium light, its strength and stiffness\r\nabout twenty-five per cent greater than white pine, and it is moderately\r\nsoft. The annual rings are rather wide, indicating rapid growth. The\r\nbands of summerwood are narrow compared with the springwood, which gives\r\na generally light color to the wood, though not as light as the wood of\r\nwhite pine. The resin passages are small and fairly numerous. The\r\nsapwood is thick, and the wood is not durable in contact with the soil.\r\n\r\nNorway pine has always had a place of its own in the lumber trade, but\r\nlarge quantities have been marketed as white pine. If such had not been\r\nthe case, Norway pine would have been much oftener heard of during the\r\nyears when the Lake State pineries were sending their billions of feet\r\nof lumber to the markets of the world.\r\n\r\nBecause of the deposit of resinous materials in the wood, Norway pine\r\nstumps resist decay much better than white pine. In some of the early\r\ncuttings in Michigan, where only stumps remain to show how large the\r\ntrees were and how thick they stood, the Norway stumps are much better\r\npreserved than the white pine. Using that fact as a basis of estimate,\r\nit may be shown that in many places the Norway pine constituted\r\none-fifth or one-fourth of the original stand. The lumbermen cut clean,\r\nand statistics of that period do not show that the two pines were\r\ngenerally marketed separately. In recent years many of the Norway stumps\r\nhave been pulled, and have been sold to wood-distillation plants where\r\nthe rosin and turpentine are extracted.\r\n\r\nAt an early date Norway pine from Canada and northern New York was\r\npopular ship timber in this country and England. Slender, straight\r\ntrunks were selected as masts, or were sawed for decking planks thirty\r\nor forty feet long. Shipbuilders insisted that planks be all heartwood,\r\nbecause when sapwood was exposed to rain and sun, it changed to a green\r\ncolor, due to the presence of fungus. The wood wears well as ship\r\ndecking. The British navy was still using some Norway pine masts as late\r\nas 1875.\r\n\r\nThe scarcity of this timber has retired it from some of the places which\r\nit once filled, and the southern yellow pines have been substituted. It\r\nis still employed for many important purposes, the chief of which is car\r\nbuilding, if statistics for the state of Illinois are a criterion for\r\nthe whole country. In 1909 in that state 24,794,000 feet of it were used\r\nfor all purposes, and 14,783,000 feet in car construction.\r\n\r\nFor many years Chicago has been the center of the Norway pine trade. It\r\nis landed there by lake steamers and by rail, and is distributed to\r\nultimate consumers. The uses for the wood, as reported by Illinois\r\nmanufacturers, follow: Baskets, boxes, boats, brackets, casing and\r\nframes for doors and windows, crating, derricks for well-boring\r\nmachines, doors, elevators, fixtures for stores and offices, foot or\r\nrunning boards for tank cars, foundry flasks, freight cars, hand rails,\r\ninsulation for refrigerator cars, ladders, picture moldings, roofing,\r\nsash, siding for cattle cars, sign boards and advertising signs, tanks,\r\nand windmill towers.\r\n\r\nAs with white pine, Norway pine has passed the period of greatest\r\nproduction, though much still goes to market every year and will long\r\ncontinue to do so. The land which lumbermen denuded in the Lake States,\r\nparticularly Michigan and Wisconsin, years ago, did not reclothe itself\r\nwith Norway seedlings. That would have taken place in most instances but\r\nfor fires which ran periodically through the slashings until all\r\nseedlings were destroyed. In many places there are now few seedlings and\r\nfew large trees to bear seeds, and consequently the pine forest in such\r\nplaces is a thing of the past. The outlook is better in other\r\nlocalities.\r\n\r\nThe Norway pine is much planted for ornament, and is rated one of the\r\nhandsomest of northern park trees.\r\n\r\n    PITCH PINE (_Pinus rigida_). The name pitch pine is locally applied\r\n    to almost every species of hard, resinous pine in this country. The\r\n    _Pinus rigida_ has other names than pitch pine. In Delaware it is\r\n    called longleaved pine, since its needles are longer than the scrub\r\n    pine’s with which it is associated. For the same reason it is known\r\n    in some localities as longschat pine. In Massachusetts it is called\r\n    hard pine, in Pennsylvania yellow pine, in North Carolina and\r\n    eastern Tennessee black pine, and black Norway pine in New York. The\r\n    botanical name is translated “rigid pine,” but the rigid refers to\r\n    the leaves, not the wood. Its range covers New England, New York,\r\n    Pennsylvania, southern Canada, eastern Ohio, and southward along the\r\n    mountains to northern Georgia. It has three leaves in a cluster,\r\n    from three to five inches long, and they fall the second year. Cones\r\n    range in length from one to three inches, and they hang on the\r\n    branches ten or twelve years. The wood is medium light, moderately\r\n    strong, but low in stiffness. It is soft and brittle. The annual\r\n    rings are wide, the summerwood broad, distinct, and very resinous.\r\n    Medullary rays are few but prominent; color, light brown or red, the\r\n    thick sapwood yellow or often nearly white. The difference in the\r\n    hardness between springwood and summerwood renders it difficult to\r\n    work, and causes uneven wear when used as flooring. It is fairly\r\n    durable in contact with the soil.\r\n\r\n    The tree attains a height of from forty to eighty feet and a\r\n    diameter of three. This pine is not found in extensive forests, but\r\n    in scattered patches, nearly always on poor soil where other trees\r\n    will not crowd it. Light and air are necessary to its existence. If\r\n    it receives these, it will fight successfully against adversities\r\n    which would be fatal to many other species. In resistance to forest\r\n    fires, it is a salamander among trees. That is primarily due to its\r\n    thick bark, but it is favored also by the situations in which it is\r\n    generally found--open woods, and on soil so poor that ground litter\r\n    is thin. It is a useful wood for many purposes, and wherever it is\r\n    found in sufficient quantity, it goes to market, but under its own\r\n    name only in restricted localities. Its resinous knots were once\r\n    used in place of candles in frontier homes. Tar made locally from\r\n    its rich wood was the pioneer wagoner’s axle grease, and the\r\n    ever-present tar bucket and tar paddle swung from the rear axle.\r\n    Torches made by tying splinters in bundles answered for lanterns in\r\n    night travel. It was the best pine for floors in some localities.\r\n    It is probably used more for boxes than for anything else at\r\n    present. In 1909 Massachusetts box makers bought 600,000 feet, and a\r\n    little more went to Maryland box factories. Its poor holding power\r\n    on spikes limits its employment as railroad ties and in\r\n    shipbuilding. Carpenters and furniture makers object to the numerous\r\n    knots. Country blacksmiths who repair and make wagons as a side\r\n    line, find it suitable for wagon beds. It is much used as fuel where\r\n    it is convenient.\r\n\r\n    TORREY PINE (_Pinus torreyana_), called del mar pine and Soledad\r\n    pine, is an interesting tree from the fact that its range is so\r\n    restricted that the actual number of trees could be easily known to\r\n    one who would take the trouble to count them. A rather large\r\n    quantity formerly occupied a small area in San Diego county,\r\n    California, but woodchoppers who did not appreciate the fact that\r\n    they were exterminating a species of pine from the face of the\r\n    earth, cut nearly all of the trees for fuel. Its range covered only\r\n    a few square miles, and fortunately part of that was included in the\r\n    city limits of San Diego. An ordinance was passed prohibiting the\r\n    cutting of a Torrey pine under heavy penalty, and the tree was thus\r\n    saved. A hundred and fifty miles off the San Diego coast a few\r\n    Torrey pines grow on the islands of Santa Cruz and Santa Rosa, and\r\n    owing to their isolated situation they bid fair to escape the\r\n    cordwood cutter for years to come. Those who have seen this tree on\r\n    its native hills have admired the gameness of its battle for\r\n    existence against the elements. Standing in the full sweep of the\r\n    ocean winds, its strong, short branches scarcely move, and all the\r\n    agitation is in the thick tufts of needles which cling to the ends\r\n    of the branches. Trees exposed to the seawinds are stunted, and are\r\n    generally less than a foot in diameter and thirty feet high; but\r\n    those which are so fortunate as to occupy sheltered valleys are\r\n    three or four times that size. The needles are five in a cluster.\r\n    The cones persist on the branches three or four years. The wood is\r\n    light, soft, moderately strong, very brittle; the rings of yearly\r\n    growth are broad, and the yellow bands of summerwood occupy nearly\r\n    half. The sapwood is very thick and is nearly white.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWESTERN YELLOW PINE\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WESTERN YELLOW PINE]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWESTERN YELLOW PINE\r\n\r\n(_Pinus Ponderosa_)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe range of western yellow pine covers a million square miles. Its\r\neastern boundary is a line drawn from South Dakota to western Texas. The\r\nspecies covers much of the country between that line and the Pacific\r\nocean. It is natural that it should have more names than one in a region\r\nso extensive. It is best known as western yellow pine, but lumbermen\r\noften call it California white pine. The standing timber is frequently\r\ndesignated bull pine, but that name is not often given to the lumber.\r\nWhere there is no likelihood of confusing it with southern pines, it is\r\ncalled simply yellow pine. The name heavy-wooded pine, sometimes applied\r\nto the lumber in England, is misleading. When well seasoned it weighs\r\nabout thirty pounds per cubic foot, and ordinarily it would not be\r\nclassed heavy. In California it is called heavy pine, but that is to\r\ndistinguish it from sugar pine which is considerably lighter. The color\r\nof its bark has given it the name Sierra brownbark pine. The same tree\r\nin Montana is called black pine.\r\n\r\nThe tree has developed two forms. Some botanists have held there are two\r\nspecies, but that is not the general opinion. In the warm, damp climate\r\nof the Pacific slope the tree is larger, and somewhat different in\r\nappearance from the form in the Rocky Mountain region. The same\r\nobservation holds true of Douglas fir.\r\n\r\nThe wood of western yellow pine is medium light, not strong, is low in\r\nelasticity, medullary rays prominent but not numerous; resinous, color\r\nlight to reddish, the thick sapwood almost white. The annual rings are\r\nvariable in width, and the proportionate amounts of springwood and\r\nsummerwood also vary. It is not durable in contact with the ground.\r\n\r\nThe wood is easy to work and some of the best of it resembles white\r\npine, but as a whole it is inferior to that wood, though it is\r\nextensively employed as a substitute for it in the manufacture of doors,\r\nsash, and frames. It is darker than white pine, harder, heavier,\r\nstronger, almost exactly equal in stiffness, but the annual rings of the\r\ntwo woods do not bear close resemblance.\r\n\r\nThe tree reaches a height of from 100 to 200 feet, a diameter from three\r\nto seven. It is occasionally much larger. Its size depends much on its\r\nhabitat. The best development occurs on the Sierra Nevada mountains in\r\nCalifornia and the best wood comes from that region, though certain\r\nother localities produce high-grade lumber.\r\n\r\nWestern yellow pine holds and will long hold an important place in the\r\ncountry’s timber resources. The total stand has been estimated at\r\n275,000,000,000 feet, and is second only to that of Douglas fir, though\r\nthe combined stand of the four southern yellow pines is about\r\n100,000,000,000 feet larger. It is a vigorous species, able to hold its\r\nground under ordinary circumstances. Next to incense cedar and the giant\r\nsequoias which are associated with it in the Sierra Nevada mountains, it\r\nis the most prolific seed bearer of the western conifers, and its seeds\r\nare sufficiently light to insure wide distribution. It is gaining ground\r\nwithin its range by taking possession of vacant areas which have been\r\nbared by lumbering or fire. In some cases it crowds to death the more\r\nstately sugar pine by cutting off its light and moisture. It resists\r\nfire better than most of the forest trees with which it is associated.\r\nOn the other hand, it suffers from enemies more than its associates do.\r\nA beetle (_Dendroctonus ponderosæ_), destroys large stands. In the Black\r\nHills in 1903 its ravages killed 600,000,000 feet.\r\n\r\nThis splendid pine has run the gamut of uses from the corral pole of the\r\nfirst settler to the paneled door turned out by the modern factory. It\r\nhas almost an unlimited capacity for usefulness. It grows in dry regions\r\nof the Rocky Mountains where it is practically the only source of wood\r\nsupply; and it is equally secure in its position where forests are\r\nabundant and fine. It has supplied props, stulls, and lagging for mines\r\nin nearly every state touched by its range. Without its ties and other\r\ntimbers some of the early railroads through the western mountains could\r\nscarcely have been built. It has been one of the leading flume timbers\r\nin western lumber and irrigation development. It fenced many ranches in\r\nearly times and is still doing so. It is used in general construction,\r\nand in finish; from the shingle to the foundation sill of houses. It\r\nfinds its way to eastern lumber markets. Almost 20,000,000 feet a year\r\nare used in Illinois alone. Competition with eastern white pine is met\r\nin the Lake States because, grade for grade, the western wood is\r\ncheaper, until lower grades are reached. The western yellow pine, in the\r\neastern market, is confused with the western white pine of Idaho and\r\nMontana (_Pinus monticola_) and separate statistics of use are\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nThe makers of fruit boxes in California often employ the yellow pine in\r\nlieu of sugar pine which once supplied the whole trade. It is also used\r\nby coopers for various containers, but not for alcoholic liquors.\r\n\r\nThe leaves are in clusters of twos and threes, and are from five to\r\neleven inches long. Most of them fall during the third year. The cones\r\nare from three to six inches long, and generally fall soon after they\r\nreach maturity.\r\n\r\n    COULTER PINE (_Pinus coulteri_) is also known as nut pine, big cone\r\n    pine, and long cone pine. It is a California species, scarce, but of\r\n    much interest because of its cones. They are larger than those of\r\n    any other American pine and are armed with formidable curved spines\r\n    from half an inch to an inch and a half in length. The cones are\r\n    from ten to fourteen inches long. The tree is found on the Coast\r\n    Range mountains from the latitude of San Francisco to the boundary\r\n    between California and Mexico. It thrives at altitudes of from 3,000\r\n    to 6,000 feet. It never occurs in pure stands and the total amount\r\n    is small. It looks like the western yellow pine, but is much\r\n    inferior in size. Trunks seldom attain a length of fifteen feet or a\r\n    diameter of two. There is no evidence that Coulter pine is\r\n    increasing its stand on the ground which it already occupies, or\r\n    spreading to new ground. The wood is light, soft, moderately strong,\r\n    and very tough. The annual rings are narrow and consist largely of\r\n    summerwood. The heartwood is light red, the thick sapwood nearly\r\n    white. It is a poor tree for lumber, and it has been little used in\r\n    that way, but has been burned for charcoal for blacksmith shops, and\r\n    much is sold as cordwood. The leaves of Coulter pine are in clusters\r\n    of three, and they fall during the third and fourth years.\r\n\r\n    CALIFORNIA SWAMP PINE (_Pinus muricata_) clearly belongs among minor\r\n    species listed as timber trees. It meets a small demand for skids,\r\n    corduroy log roads, bridge floors, and scaffolds in the redwood\r\n    logging operations in California. It is scattered along the Pacific\r\n    coast 500 miles, beginning in Lower California and ending a hundred\r\n    miles north of San Francisco. It is known as dwarf marine pine,\r\n    pricklecone pine, bishop pine, and obispo pine. The last name is the\r\n    Spanish translation of the English word bishop. The largest trees\r\n    seldom exceed two feet in diameter, and a height of ninety feet. The\r\n    average size is little more than half as much. The wood is very\r\n    strong, hard, and compact, and the annual growth ring is largely\r\n    dense summerwood. Resin passages are few, but the wood is resinous,\r\n    light brown in color, and the thick sapwood is nearly white. The\r\n    needles are in clusters of two, and are from four to six inches\r\n    long. They begin to fall the second year. Some of the trees retain\r\n    their cones until death, but the seeds are scattered from year to\r\n    year. Under the stimulus of artificial conditions in the redwood\r\n    districts this pine seems to be spreading. Its seeds blow into\r\n    vacant ground from which redwood has been removed, and growth is\r\n    prompt. The seedlings are not at all choice as to soil, but take\r\n    root in cold clay, in peat bogs, on barren sand and gravel, and on\r\n    wind-swept ridges exposed to ocean fogs. Its ability to grow where\r\n    few other trees can maintain themselves holds out some hope that its\r\n    usefulness will increase.\r\n\r\n    MONTEREY PINE (_Pinus radiata_). This scarce and local species is\r\n    restricted to the California coast south of San Francisco, and to\r\n    adjacent islands. Under favorable circumstances it grows rapidly and\r\n    promises to be of more importance as a lumber source in the future\r\n    than it has been in the past. It is, however, somewhat particular as\r\n    to soil. It must have ground not too wet or too dry. If these\r\n    requirements are observed, it is a good tree for planting. Its\r\n    average height is seventy or ninety feet, diameter from eighteen to\r\n    thirty inches. Trunks six feet in diameter are occasionally heard\r\n    of. The wood is light, soft, moderately strong, tough, annual rings\r\n    very wide and largely of springwood; color, light brown, the very\r\n    thick sapwood nearly white. The leaves are from four to six inches\r\n    long, in clusters of two and three, and fall the third year. Cones\r\n    are from three to five inches long. The lumber is too scarce at\r\n    present to have much importance, but its quality is good. In\r\n    appearance it resembles wide-ringed loblolly pine, and appears to be\r\n    suitable for doors and sash, and frames for windows and doors. Its\r\n    present uses are confined chiefly to ranch timbers and fuel. If it\r\n    ever amounts to much as a lumber resource, it will be as a planted\r\n    pine, and not in its natural state.\r\n\r\n    JACK PINE (_Pinus divaricata_) is a far northern species which\r\n    extends its range southward in the United States, from Maine to\r\n    Minnesota, and reaches northern Indiana and Illinois. It grows\r\n    almost far enough north in the valley of Mackenzie river to catch\r\n    the rays of the midnight sun. It must necessarily adapt itself to\r\n    circumstances. When these are favorable, it develops a trunk up to\r\n    two feet in diameter and seventy feet tall; but in adversity, it\r\n    degenerates into a many-branched shrub a few feet high. The average\r\n    tree in the United States is thirty or forty feet tall, and a foot\r\n    or more in diameter. Its name is intended as a term of contempt,\r\n    which it does not deserve. Others call it scrub pine which is little\r\n    better. Its other names are more respectful, Prince’s pine in\r\n    Ontario, black pine in Wisconsin and Minnesota, cypress in Quebec\r\n    and the Hudson Bay country, Sir Joseph Banks’ pine in England, and\r\n    juniper in some parts of Canada. “Chek pine” is frequently given in\r\n    its list of names, but the name is said to have originated in an\r\n    attempt of a German botanist to pronounce “Jack pine” in dictating\r\n    to a stenographer. The tree straggles over landscapes which\r\n    otherwise would be treeless. It is often a ragged and uncouth\r\n    specimen of the vegetable kingdom, but that is when it is at its\r\n    worst. At its best, as it may be seen where cared for in some of the\r\n    Michigan cemeteries, it is as handsome a tree as anyone could\r\n    desire. The characteristic thinness and delicacy of its foliage\r\n    distinguish it at once from its associates. The peculiar green of\r\n    its soft, short needles wins admiration. The wood is light, soft,\r\n    not strong; annual rings are moderately wide, and are largely\r\n    composed of springwood. The thin bands of summerwood are resinous,\r\n    and the small resin ducts are few. The thick sapwood is nearly\r\n    white, the heartwood brown or orange. It is not durable.\r\n\r\n    Jack pine can never be an important timber tree, because too small;\r\n    but a considerable amount is used for bed slats, nail kegs,\r\n    plastering lath, barrel headings, boxes, mine props, pulpwood, and\r\n    fuel. Aside from its use as lumber and small manufactured products,\r\n    it has a value for other purposes. It can maintain its existence in\r\n    waste sands; and its usefulness is apparent in fixing drifting dunes\r\n    along some of the exposed shores of Lake Michigan and Lake Superior.\r\n    It lives on dry sand and sends its roots several feet to water; or,\r\n    under circumstances entirely different, it thrives in swamps where\r\n    the watertable is little below the surface of the ground. It fights\r\n    a brave battle against adversities while it lasts, but it does not\r\n    live long. Sixty years is old age for this tree. It grows fast while\r\n    young, but later it devotes all its energies to the mere process of\r\n    living, and its increase in size is slow, until at a period when\r\n    most trees are still in early youth, it dies of old age, and the\r\n    northern winds quickly whip away its limbs, leaving the barkless\r\n    trunk to stand a few years longer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLODGEPOLE PINE\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LODGEPOLE PINE]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLODGEPOLE PINE\r\n\r\n(_Pinus Contorta_)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe common name of this tree was given it because its tall, slender,\r\nvery light poles were used by Indians of the region in the construction\r\nof their lodges. They selected poles fifteen feet long and two inches in\r\ndiameter, set them in a circle, bent the tops together, tied them, and\r\ncovered the frame with skins or bark. The poles were peeled in early\r\nsummer, when the Indians set out upon their summer hunt, and were left\r\nto season until fall, when they were carried to the winter’s camping\r\nplace, probably fifty miles distant. Tamarack is a common name for this\r\npine in much of its range; it is likewise known as black pine, spruce\r\npine, and prickly pine. Its leaves are from one to two inches long, in\r\nclusters of two. The small cones adhere to the branches many\r\nyears--sometimes as long as twenty--without releasing the seeds, which\r\nare sealed within the cone by accumulated resin. The vitality of the\r\nseeds is remarkable. They don’t lose their power of germination during\r\ntheir long imprisonment.\r\n\r\nThe lodgepole pine has been called a fire tree, and the name is not\r\ninappropriate. It profits by severe burning, as some other trees of the\r\nUnited States do, such as paper birch and bird cherry. The sealed cones\r\nare opened by fire, which softens the resin, and the seeds are liberated\r\nafter the fire has passed, and wing their flight wherever the wind\r\ncarries them. The passing fire may be severe enough to kill the parent\r\ntree without destroying or bringing down the cones. The seeds soon fall\r\non the bared mineral soil, where they germinate by thousands. More than\r\none hundred thousand small seedling trees may occupy a single acre. Most\r\nof them are ultimately crowded to death, but a thick stand results. Most\r\nlodgepole pine forests occupy old burns. The tree is one of the slowest\r\nof growers. It never reaches large size--possibly three feet is the\r\nlimit. It is very tall and slender. A hundred years will scarcely\r\nproduce a sawlog of the smallest size.\r\n\r\nThe range of this tree covers a million square miles from Alaska to New\r\nMexico, and to the Pacific coast. Its characters vary in different parts\r\nof its range. A scrub form was once thought to be a different species,\r\nand was called shore pine.\r\n\r\nThe wood is of about the same weight as eastern white pine. It is light\r\nin color, rather weak, and brittle, annual rings very narrow, summerwood\r\nsmall in amount, resin passages few and small; medullary rays numerous,\r\nbroad, and prominent. The wood is characterized by numerous small knots.\r\nIt is not durable in contact with the ground, but it readily receives\r\npreservative treatment. In height it ranges from fifty to one hundred\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nThe government’s estimate of the stand of lodgepole pine in the United\r\nStates in 1909 placed it at 90,000,000,000 feet. That makes it seventh\r\nin quantity among the timber trees of this country, those above it being\r\nDouglas fir, the southern yellow pines (considered as one), western\r\nyellow pine, redwood, western hemlock, and the red cedar of Washington,\r\nOregon, and Idaho.\r\n\r\nLodgepole pine has been long and widely used as a ranch timber in the\r\nFar West, serving for poles and rails in fences, for sheds, barns,\r\ncorrals, pens, and small bridges. Where it could be had at all, it was\r\ngenerally plentiful. Stock ranges high among the mountains frequently\r\ndepend almost solely upon lodgepole pine for necessary timber.\r\n\r\nMine operators find it a valuable resource. As props it is cheap,\r\nsubstantial, and convenient in many parts of Colorado, New Mexico,\r\nWyoming, and Montana. A large proportion of this timber which is cut for\r\nmining purposes has been standing dead from fire injury many years, and\r\nis thoroughly seasoned and very light. It is in excellent condition for\r\nreceiving preservative treatment.\r\n\r\nSawmills do not list lodgepole pine separately in reports of lumber cut,\r\nand it is impossible to determine what the annual supply from the\r\nspecies is. It is well known that the quantity made into lumber in\r\nColorado, Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho is large. Its chief market is\r\namong the newly established agricultural communities in those states.\r\nThey use it for fruit and vegetable shipping boxes, fencing plank,\r\npickets, and plastering lath.\r\n\r\nRailroads buy half a million lodgepole pine crossties yearly. When\r\ncreosoted, they resist decay many years. Lodgepole pine has been a tie\r\nmaterial since the first railroads entered the region, and while by no\r\nmeans the best, it promises to fill a much more important place in the\r\nfuture than in the past. It is an ideal fence post material as far as\r\nsize and form are concerned, and with preservative treatment it is bound\r\nto attain a high place. It is claimed that treated posts will last\r\ntwenty years, and that puts them on a par with the cedars.\r\n\r\nIn Colorado and Wyoming much lodgepole was formerly burned for charcoal\r\nto supply the furnaces which smelted ore and the blacksmith shops of the\r\nregion. This is done now less than formerly, since railroad building has\r\nmade coal and coke accessible.\r\n\r\nIn one respect, lodgepole pine is to the western mountains what loblolly\r\npine is to the flat country of the south Atlantic and other southern\r\nstates. It is aggressive, and takes possession of vacant ground.\r\nAlthough the wood is not as valuable as loblolly, it is useful, and has\r\nan important place to fill in the western country’s development. Its\r\ngreatest drawback is its exceedingly slow growth. A hundred years is a\r\nlong time to wait for trees of pole size. Two crops of loblolly sawlogs\r\ncan be harvested in that time. However, the land on which the lodgepole\r\ngrows is fit only for timber, and the acreage is so vast that there is\r\nenough to grow supplies, even with the wait of a century or two for\r\nharvest. The stand has increased enormously within historic time, the\r\nsame as loblolly, and for a similar reason. Men cleared land in the\r\nEast, and loblolly took possession; fires destroyed western forests of\r\nother species and lodgepole seized and held the burned tracts.\r\n\r\nIf fires cease among the western mountains, as will probably be the case\r\nunder more efficient methods of patrol, and with stricter enforcement of\r\nlaws against starting fires, the spread of lodgepole pine will come to a\r\nstandstill, and existing forests will grow old without much extension of\r\ntheir borders.\r\n\r\nJEFFREY PINE (_Pinus jeffreyi_) is often classed as western yellow pine,\r\nboth in the forest and at the mill. Its range extends from southern\r\nOregon to Lower California, a distance of 1,000 miles, and its width\r\neast and west varies from twenty to one hundred and fifty miles. It is a\r\nmountain tree and generally occupies elevations above the western yellow\r\npine. In the North its range reaches 3,600 feet above sea level; in the\r\nextreme South it is 10,000 feet. The darker and more deeply-furrowed\r\nbark of the Jeffrey pine is the usual character by which lumbermen\r\ndistinguish it from the western yellow pine. It is known under several\r\nnames, most of them relating to the tree’s appearance, such as black\r\npine, redbark pine, blackbark pine, sapwood pine, and bull pine. It\r\nreaches the same size as the western yellow pine, though the average is\r\na little smaller. The leaves are from four to nine inches long, and fall\r\nin eight or nine years. The cones are large, and armed with slender,\r\ncurved spines. The seeds are too heavy to fly far, their wing area being\r\nsmall. It is a vigorous tree, and in some regions it forms good forests.\r\nSome botanists have considered the Jeffrey pine a variety of the western\r\nyellow pine.\r\n\r\n    GRAY PINE (_Pinus sabiniana_), called also Digger pine because the\r\n    Digger Indians formerly collected the seeds, which are as large as\r\n    peanuts, to help eke out a living, is confined to California, and\r\n    grows in a belt on the foothills surrounding the San Joaquin and\r\n    Sacramento valleys. Its cones are large and armed with hooked\r\n    spines. When green, the largest cones weigh three or four pounds.\r\n    Leaves are from eight to twelve inches long, in clusters of two and\r\n    three, and fall the third and fourth years. The wood is remarkable\r\n    for the quickness of its decay in damp situations. It lasts one or\r\n    two years as fence posts. A mature gray pine is from fifty to\r\n    seventy feet high, and eighteen to thirty inches in diameter. Some\r\n    trees are much larger. It is of considerable importance, but is not\r\n    in the same class as western yellow and sugar pine. The wood is\r\n    light, soft, rather strong, brittle. The annual rings are generally\r\n    wide, indicating rapid growth. Very old gray pines are not known. An\r\n    age of 185 years seems to be the highest on record. The wood is\r\n    resinous, and it has helped in a small way to supply the Pacific\r\n    coast markets with high-grade turpentine, distilled from roots. It\r\n    yields resin when boxed like the southern longleaf pine. There are\r\n    two flowing seasons. One is very early, and closes when the weather\r\n    becomes hot; the other is in full current by the middle of August.\r\n    It maintains life among the California foothills during the long\r\n    rainless seasons, on ground so dry that semi-desert chaparral\r\n    sometimes succumbs; but it is able to make the most of favorable\r\n    conditions, and it grows rapidly under the slightest encouragement.\r\n    The seedlings are more numerous now than formerly, which is\r\n    attributed to decrease of forest fires. The tree has enemies which\r\n    generally attack it in youth. Two fungi, _Peridermium harknessi_,\r\n    and _Dædalia vorax_, destroy the young tree’s leader or topmost\r\n    shoot, causing the development of a short trunk. The latter fungus\r\n    is the same or is closely related to that which tunnels the trunk of\r\n    incense cedar and produces pecky cypress.\r\n\r\n    Gray pine has been cut to some extent for lumber, but its principal\r\n    uses have been as fuel and mine timbers. Many quartz mines have been\r\n    located in the region where the tree grows; and the engines which\r\n    pumped the shafts and raised and crushed the ore were often heated\r\n    with this pine. Thousands of acres of hillsides in the vicinity of\r\n    mines were stripped of it, and it went to the engine house ricks in\r\n    wagons, on sleds, and on the backs of burros. In two respects it is\r\n    an economical fuel for remote mines: it is light in weight, and\r\n    gives more heat than an equal quantity of the oak that is associated\r\n    with it.\r\n\r\n    CHIHUAHUA PINE (_Pinus chihuahuana_) is not abundant, but it exists\r\n    in small commercial quantities in southwestern New Mexico and\r\n    southern Arizona. Trees are from fifty to eighty feet high, and from\r\n    fifteen to twenty inches in diameter. The wood is medium light,\r\n    soft, rather strong, brittle, narrow ringed and compact. The resin\r\n    passages are few, large, and conspicuous; color, clear light orange,\r\n    the thick sapwood lighter. The tree reaches best development at\r\n    altitudes of from 5,000 to 7,000 feet. When the wood is used, it\r\n    serves the same purposes as western yellow pine; but the small size\r\n    of the tree makes lumber of large size impossible. The leaves are in\r\n    clusters of three, and fall the fourth year. The cones have long\r\n    stalks and are from one and a half to two inches long.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTAMARACK\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TAMARACK]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTAMARACK\r\n\r\n(_Larix Laricina_)\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are three species of tamarack or larch in the United States, and\r\nprobably a fourth is confined to Alaska. One has its range in the\r\nnortheastern states, extending south to West Virginia and northwestward\r\nto Alaska. Two are found in the northwestern states. Other species are\r\nnative of the eastern hemisphere, and some of them have been planted to\r\nsome extent in this country. A species of Europe is of much importance\r\nin that country. The tamaracks lose their leaves in the fall and the\r\nbranches are bare during the winter. The name tamarack or larch should\r\nbe applied only to trees of the genus _larix_. This rule is not observed\r\nin some parts of the West where the noble fir (_Abies nobilis_) is\r\noccasionally called larch by lumbermen. It is not entitled to that name,\r\nand confusion results from such use.\r\n\r\nThe larches are easily identified. They have needle leaves like those of\r\npines and firs, but they are differently arranged. They are produced in\r\nlittle brush-like bundles, from twelve to forty leaves in each, on all\r\nthe shoots, except the leaders. On these the leaves occur singly. The\r\nlittle brushes are so conspicuous, and so characteristic of this genus,\r\nincluding all its species, that there should be little difficulty in\r\nidentifying the larches when the leaves are on. In winter, when the\r\nbranches are bare, there are other easy marks of identification.\r\n\r\nThe little brushes are interesting objects of study. Botanists tell us\r\nthat the excrescence or bud-like knob from which the leaves grow is\r\nreally a suppressed or aborted branch, with all its leaves crowded\r\ntogether at the end. If it were developed, it would bear its leaves\r\nsingly, scattered along its full length, as they occur on the leading\r\nshoots. The warty appearance of the branches in winter is a very\r\nconvenient means of identification when the leaves are down.\r\n\r\nThe cones of larches mature in a single season, and often hang on the\r\ntrees several years. They are conspicuous in winter when the branches\r\nare bare of foliage. The adhering cones are generally seedless after the\r\nfirst season, since they quickly let their winged seeds go. The male and\r\nfemale flowers are produced singly on branches of the previous year.\r\n\r\nThe eastern and northern larch (_Larix laricina_) has a number of names.\r\nIt is commonly known as tamarack in the New England states and in New\r\nYork, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, Michigan,\r\nMinnesota, Ohio, and in Canada. The name larch is applied in practically\r\nall the regions where it grows, but it is not used as frequently as\r\ntamarack. Hackmatack, which was the Indian name for the tree in part of\r\nits eastern range, is still in use in Maine, New Hampshire,\r\nMassachusetts, Rhode Island, Delaware, Illinois, Minnesota, and Ontario.\r\nNurserymen call it American larch to distinguish it from other larches\r\non the market, particularly the European larch. Michaux, an early French\r\nbotanist who explored American forests, called it American larch (_Larix\r\namericana_), and the name which he gave has been retained by many\r\nscientists to this day. In the Canadian provinces north of the Great\r\nLakes, and also in Maine and New Brunswick, it is frequently called\r\njuniper, but without good reason, for it has little of the appearance\r\nand few of the qualities of the junipers. In some localities it is\r\ncalled black larch, and in others red larch. The first name refers to\r\nthe color of its bark, the last to the leaves when about to fall, for\r\nthey then change to a brown or reddish color. They fall in the autumn,\r\nand the branches are bare until the next spring. Some of the New York\r\nIndians observed that peculiarity of the tree which they thought should\r\nbe an evergreen like the balsam and pines with which it was often\r\nassociated, and they named it kenehtens, meaning “the leaves fall”.\r\nIndians did not, as a rule, give separate names to tree species, and\r\nwhen they did so, it was because of food value, or from some peculiarity\r\nwhich could not fail to attract the notice of a savage.\r\n\r\nThe tamarack’s geographical range is remarkable. It is said to be best\r\ndeveloped in the region east of Manitoba, but it extends southward into\r\nWest Virginia and northward to the land of the midnight sun. It\r\nmaintains its place almost to the arctic snows, and the willow is about\r\nthe only tree that pushes farther north. It is found from Newfoundland\r\nand Labrador far down toward the mouth of the Mackenzie river, north of\r\nthe arctic circle. It grows on dry land as well as wet, but is oftenest\r\nfound in cold swamps, particularly in the southern part of its range.\r\nSilted-up lakes are favorite situations, and on the made-land above old\r\nbeaver dams.\r\n\r\nTamarack forests frequently stand on ground so soft that a pole may be\r\nthrust ten feet deep in the mud. The moist, monotonous sphagnum moss\r\ngenerally furnishes ground cover in such places. A tamarack swamp in\r\nsummer is cool and pleasant--provided there is not too much water on the\r\nground--but in winter a more desolate picture can scarcely be imagined.\r\nThe leafless trees appear to be dead, and covered with lifeless cones;\r\nbut the first warm days bring it to life.\r\n\r\nThe average height of tamarack trees is from forty to sixty feet,\r\ndiameter twenty inches or less. Leaves are one-half or one and a half\r\ninches long; cones one-half or three-quarter inches, and bright chestnut\r\nbrown at maturity. They fall when two years old. The winged seeds are\r\nvery small. The tree is neither a frequent nor abundant seeder. The\r\nfoliage is thin, and is not sufficient to shut much sunlight from the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nThe wood is heavy, hard, very strong, and is durable in contact with the\r\nsoil. The growth is slow, annual rings narrow, summerwood occupies\r\nnearly half the ring, and is dark-colored, resinous, and conspicuous;\r\nresin passages few and obscure; medullary rays numerous and obscure;\r\ncolor of wood light brown, the sapwood nearly white.\r\n\r\nThe uses of tamarack go back to prehistoric times. The Indians of Canada\r\nand northeastern United States drew supplies from four forest trees when\r\nthey made their bark canoes. The bark for the shell came from paper\r\nbirch, threads for sewing the strips of bark together were tamarack\r\nroots, resin for stopping leaks was a product of balsam fir, and the\r\nlight framework of wood was northern white cedar.\r\n\r\nThe roots which best suited the Indian’s purpose came from trees which\r\ngrew in soft, deep mud, where lakes and beaver ponds had silted up. Such\r\nroots are long, slender, and very tough and pliant, and may be gathered\r\nin large numbers, particularly where running streams have partly\r\nundermined standing trees.\r\n\r\nWhite men likewise made use of tamarack roots in boat building, but the\r\nroots were different from what the Indians used. “Instep” crooks were\r\nhewed for ship knees. These were large roots, the larger the better.\r\nTrees which produced them did not grow in deep mud, for there the roots\r\ndid not develop crooks. The ship knee operator hunted for tamarack\r\nforests growing on a soft surface soil two or three feet deep, underlaid\r\nby stiff clay or rock which roots could not penetrate. In situations\r\nlike that the roots go straight down until they reach the hard stratum,\r\nand then turn at right angles and grow in a horizontal direction. The\r\nturning point in the root develops the crook of which the ship knee is\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nTamarack is seldom of sufficient size for the largest ship knees. Such\r\nwere formerly supplied by southern live oak; and in that case crooks\r\nformed by the union of trunk and large branches were as good as those\r\nproduced by the union of trunk and large roots.\r\n\r\nTamarack is still employed in the manufacture of boat knees, but not as\r\nmuch as formerly. Steel frames have largely taken the place of wood in\r\nthe construction of ship skeletons. Boat builders use tamarack now for\r\nfloors, keels, stringers, and knees.\r\n\r\nTamarack has come into much use in recent years. Sawmills cut from it\r\nmore than 125,000,000 feet of lumber a year. Fourteen states contribute,\r\nbut most of the lumber is produced in Minnesota, Michigan, and\r\nWisconsin. Railroads in the United States buy 5,000,000 or more\r\ntamarack ties a year, which reduced to board measure amount to over\r\n150,000,000 feet. Fence posts and telegraph poles come in large numbers\r\nfrom tamarack forests.\r\n\r\nThe wood is stiff and strong, its stiffness being eighty-four per cent\r\nof that of long leaf pine, and its strength about eighty per cent.\r\nUnusual variations in both strength and stiffness are found. One stick\r\nof tamarack may rate twice as high as another.\r\n\r\nThe wood-using factories of Michigan consume nearly 20,000,000 feet of\r\nthis wood yearly. It is made into boxes, excelsior, pails, tanks, tubs,\r\nhouse finish, refrigerators, windmills, and wooden pipes for waterworks\r\nand for draining mines.\r\n\r\nThere is little likelihood that the supply of tamarack will run short in\r\nthe near future. While it is not in the first rank of the important\r\ntrees in this country, it is useful, and it is fortunate that it\r\npromises to hold its ground against fires which do grave injury to\r\nnorthern forests. In the swamps where the most of it is found the ground\r\nlitter is too damp to burn. The tree does not grow rapidly, but it\r\nusually occupies lands which cannot be profitably devoted to\r\nagriculture, and it will, therefore, be let alone until it reaches\r\nmaturity.\r\n\r\nTamarack is a familiar tree in parks, and it grows farther south than\r\nits natural range extends. It is not as desirable a park tree as\r\nhemlock, spruce, fir, the cedars, and some of the pines, because its\r\nfoliage is thin in summer and wanting in winter. It is in a class with\r\ncypress. In the early spring, however, while its soft green needles are\r\nbeginning to show themselves in clusters along the twigs, its delicate\r\nand unusual appearance attracts more attention than its companion trees\r\nwhich are always in full leaf and for that reason are somewhat\r\nmonotonous.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWESTERN LARCH\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WESTERN LARCH]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWESTERN LARCH\r\n\r\n(_Larix Occidentalis_)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a magnificent tree of the Northwest, and its range lies\r\nprincipally on the upper tributaries of the Columbia river, in Idaho,\r\nMontana, and British Columbia, but it occurs also among the Blue\r\nMountains of Washington and Oregon. It is the largest member of the\r\nlarch genus, either in the old world or the new. The finest trees are\r\n250 feet high with diameters of six or eight feet, but sizes half of\r\nthat are nearer the average. The trunk is of splendid form. In early\r\nlife it is limby, but later it prunes itself, and a long, tapering bole\r\nis developed with a very small crown of thin foliage. No other tree of\r\nits size, with the possible exception of old sequoias, has so little\r\nfoliage in proportion to the trunk.\r\n\r\nThe result is apparent in the rate of growth after the larch has passed\r\nits youth. Sometimes such a tree does not increase its trunk diameter as\r\nmuch in seventy-five years as a vigorous loblolly pine or willow oak\r\nwill in one year. The trunk of a tree, as is well known, grows by means\r\nof food manufactured by the leaves and sent down to be transformed into\r\nwood. With so few leaves and a trunk so large, the slowness of growth is\r\na natural consequence. Though the annual rings are usually quite narrow,\r\nthe bands of summerwood are relatively broad. That accounts for the\r\ndensity of larchwood and its great weight. It is six per cent heavier\r\nthan longleaf pine, and is not much inferior in strength and elasticity.\r\nThe leaves are from one to one and three-quarter inches long, the cones\r\nfrom one to one and a half inches, and the seeds nearly one-quarter inch\r\nin length. They are equipped with wings of sufficient power to carry\r\nthem a short distance from the parent tree.\r\n\r\nThe bark on young larches is thin, but on large trunks, and near the\r\nground, it may be five or six inches thick. When a notch is cut in the\r\ntrunk it collects a resin of sweetish taste which the Indians use as an\r\narticle of food.\r\n\r\nThe western larch reaches its best development in northern Idaho and\r\nMontana on streams which flow into Flathead lake. The tree prefers moist\r\nbottom lands, but grows well in other situations, at altitudes of from\r\n2,000 to 7,000 feet. The figures given above on the wood’s weight,\r\nstrength, and stiffness show its value for manufacturing purposes. Its\r\nremoteness from markets has stood in the way of large use, but it has\r\nbeen tried for many purposes and with highly satisfactory results. In\r\n1910 sawmills in the four western states where it grows cut 255,186,000\r\nfeet. Most of this is used as rough lumber, but some is made into\r\nfurniture, finish, boxes, and boats. The wood has several names, though\r\nlarch is the most common. It is otherwise known as tamarack and\r\nhackmatack, which names are oftener applied to the eastern tree; red\r\nAmerican larch, western tamarack, and great western larch.\r\n\r\nSome of the annual cut of lumber credited to western larch does not\r\nbelong to it. Lumbermen have confused names and mixed figures by\r\napplying this tree’s name to noble fir, which is a different tree. If\r\nthe fir lumber listed as larch were given its proper name, it would\r\nresult in lowering the output of larch as shown in statistical figures.\r\nIn spite of this, however, larch lumber fills an important place in the\r\ntrade of the northern Rocky Mountain region.\r\n\r\nThere is little doubt that it will fill a much more important place in\r\nthe future, for a beginning has scarcely been made in marketing this\r\ntimber. The available supply is large, but exact figures are not\r\navailable. Some stands are dense and extensive, and the trees are of\r\nlarge size and fine form. It is not supposed, however, that there will\r\nbe much after the present stand has been cut, because a second crop from\r\ntrees of so slow growth will be far in the future. Sudworth says that\r\nlarch trees eighteen or twenty inches in diameter are from 250 to 300\r\nyears old, and that the ordinary age of these trees in the forests of\r\nthe Northwest is from 300 to 500 years; while larger trees are 600 or\r\n700. Much remains to be learned concerning the ages of these trees in\r\ndifferent situations and in different parts of its range. It is\r\napparent, however, that when a period covering two or three centuries is\r\nrequired to produce a sawlog of only moderate size, timber owners will\r\nnot look forward with much eagerness to a second growth forest of\r\nwestern larch.\r\n\r\nThe value of the wood of western larch has been the subject of much\r\ncontroversy. In the tables compiled for the federal census of 1880,\r\nunder direction of Charles S. Sargent, its strength and elasticity were\r\nshown to be remarkably high. The figures indicate that it is about\r\nthirty-nine per cent stronger than white oak and fifty-one per cent\r\nstiffer. This places it a little above longleaf pine in strength and\r\nnearly equal to it in stiffness or elasticity. Engineers have expressed\r\ndoubts as to the correctness of Sargent’s figures. They believe them too\r\nhigh. The samples tested by Sargent were six in number, four of them\r\ncollected in Washington and two in Montana.\r\n\r\nThe wood of western larch is heavier than longleaf pine, and\r\napproximately of the same weight as white oak. It is among the heaviest,\r\nif not actually the heaviest, of softwoods of the United States. Sargent\r\nthus described the physical properties of the wood: “Heavy, exceedingly\r\nhard and strong, rather coarse grained, compact, satiny, susceptible of\r\na fine polish, very durable in contact with the soil; bands of small\r\nsummer cells broad, occupying fully half the width of the annual growth,\r\nvery resinous, dark-colored, conspicuous resin passages few, obscure;\r\nmedullary rays few, thin; color, light bright red, the thin sapwood\r\nnearly white.” The wood is described by Sudworth: “Clear, reddish brown,\r\nheavy, and fine grained; commercially valuable; very durable in an\r\nunprotected state, differing greatly in this respect from the wood of\r\nthe eastern larch.”\r\n\r\nThe seasoning of western larch has given lumbermen much trouble. It\r\nchecks badly and splinters rise from the surface of boards. It is\r\ngenerally admitted that this is the most serious obstacle in the way of\r\nsecuring wide utilization for the wood. The structure of the annual ring\r\nis reason for believing that there is slight adhesion between the\r\nspringwood and that of the late season. Checks are very numerous\r\nparallel with the growth rings, and splinters part from the board along\r\nthe same lines. Standing timber is frequently windshaken, and the cracks\r\nfollow the rings.\r\n\r\nAll of this is presumptive evidence that the principle defect of larch\r\nis a lack of adhesion between the early and the late wood. If that is\r\ncorrect, it is a fundamental defect in the growing tree, and is inherent\r\nin the wood. No artificial treatment can wholly remove it. It should not\r\nbe considered impossible, however, to devise methods of seasoning which\r\nwould not accentuate the weaknesses natural to the wood.\r\n\r\nThe form of the larch’s trunk is perfect, from the lumberman’s\r\nviewpoint, and its size is all that could be desired. It is amply able\r\nto perpetuate its species, though it consumes a great deal of time in\r\nthe process. Abundant crops of seeds are borne, but only once in several\r\nyears. It rarely bears seeds as early as its twenty-fifth year, and\r\ngenerally not until it passes forty; but its fruitful period is long,\r\nextending over several centuries. The seeds retain their vitality\r\nmoderately well, which is an important consideration in view of the\r\ntree’s habit of opening and closing its cones alternately as the weather\r\nhappens to be damp or dry. The dispersion of seeds extends over a\r\nconsiderable part of the season, and the changing winds scatter them in\r\nall directions. Many seeds fall on the snow in winter to be let down on\r\nthe damp ground ready to germinate during the early spring. The best\r\ngermination occurs on mineral soil, and this is often found in areas\r\nrecently bared by fire. Lodgepole pine contends also for this ground;\r\nbut the race between the two species is not swift after the process of\r\nscattering seeds has been completed; for both are of growth so\r\nexceedingly slow that a hundred years will scarcely tell which is\r\ngaining. In the long run, however, the larch outstrips the pine and\r\nbecomes a larger tree. If both start at the same time, and there is not\r\nroom for both, the pine will kill the larch by shading it. The latter’s\r\nthin foliage renders it incapable of casting a shadow dense enough to\r\nhurt the pine. The best areas for larch are those so thoroughly burned\r\nas to preclude the immediate heavy reproduction of lodgepole pine.\r\n\r\nMuch of the natural ranges of larch and lodgepole pine lie in the\r\nnational forests owned by the government, and careful studies have been\r\nmade in recent years to determine the requirements, and the actual and\r\ncomparative values of the two species. It has been shown that larch is\r\none of the most intolerant of the western forest trees. It cannot endure\r\nshade. Its own thin foliage, where it occurs in pure stands, is\r\nsufficient to shade off the lower limbs of boles, and produce tall,\r\nclean trunks; but if a larch happens to stand in the open, where light\r\nis abundant, it retains its branches almost to the ground. It is more\r\nintolerant, even, than western yellow pine, which so often grows in\r\nopen, parklike stands.\r\n\r\nALPINE LARCH (_Larix lyallii_) never grows naturally below an altitude\r\nof 4,000 feet, and near the southern border of its range it climbs to\r\n8,000, where it stands on the brink of precipices, faces of cliffs, and\r\non windswept summits. It is too much exposed to storms, and has its\r\nroots in soil too sterile to develop symmetrical forms. It is found in\r\nMontana, Idaho, Washington, and Oregon. The finest trees are sometimes\r\nseventy-five feet high and three or four in diameter, but the average\r\nheight ranges from forty to fifty, with diameters of twenty inches or\r\nless. Its leaves are one and a half inches or less in length; cones one\r\nand a half inches long, and bristling with hair; seeds one-eighth of an\r\ninch long with wings one-fourth inch; wood heavy, hard, and of a light,\r\nreddish brown color. It is seldom used except about mountain camps where\r\nit is sometimes burned for fuel or is employed in constructing corrals\r\nfor sheep and cattle. It is impossible for lumbermen ever to make much\r\nuse of it, because it is scarce and hard to get at.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRED CEDAR\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RED CEDAR]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRED CEDAR\r\n\r\n(_Juniperus Virginiana_)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis widely distributed tree is called red cedar in New Hampshire,\r\nVermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New York, New Jersey,\r\nPennsylvania, Delaware, West Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina,\r\nGeorgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Kentucky, Missouri,\r\nIllinois, Indiana, Wisconsin, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and\r\nOntario; cedar in Connecticut, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, South Carolina,\r\nKentucky, Illinois, Iowa, and Ohio; savin in Massachusetts, Rhode\r\nIsland, New York, Pennsylvania and Minnesota; juniper in New York and\r\nPennsylvania; juniper bush in Minnesota; cedre in Louisiana.\r\n\r\nThe names as given above indicate the tree’s commercial range. It\r\nappears as scattered growth and in doubtful forms outside of that range,\r\nparticularly in the West where several cedars closely resemble the red\r\ncedar, yet differ sufficiently from it to give them places as separate\r\nspecies in the lists of some botanists. They are so listed by the United\r\nStates Forest Service; and the following names are given: Western\r\nJuniper, Rocky Mountain Juniper, One Seed Juniper, Mountain Juniper,\r\nCalifornia Juniper, Utah Juniper, Drooping Juniper, Dwarf Juniper, and\r\nAlligator Juniper. These species are not of much importance from the\r\nlumberman’s viewpoint, yet they are highly interesting trees, and in\r\nthis book will be treated individually.\r\n\r\nThe red cedar grows slowly, and thrives in almost any soil and situation\r\nexcept deep swamps. It is often classed as a poor-land species, yet it\r\ndoes not naturally seek poor land. That it is often found in such\r\nsituations is because it has been crowded from better places by stronger\r\ntrees, and has retreated to rocky ridges, dry slopes, and thin soils\r\nwhere competitors are unable to follow. The trees often stand wide apart\r\nor solitary, yet they can grow in thickets almost impenetrable, as they\r\ndo in Texas and other southern states. It is an old-field tree in much\r\nof its range. Birds plant the seeds, particularly along fence rows. That\r\nis why long lines of cedars may often be seen extending across old\r\nfields or deserted plantations.\r\n\r\nThe extreme size attained by this cedar is four feet in diameter, and\r\none hundred in height, but that size was never common, and at present\r\nthe half of it is above the average. That which reaches market is more\r\noften under than over eighteen inches in diameter. The reddish-brown and\r\nfibrous bark may be peeled in long strips. Stringiness of bark is\r\ncharacteristic of all the cedars, and typical of red cedar.\r\n\r\nThe wood is medium light and is strong, considering that it is very\r\nbrittle. Tests show it to be eighty per cent as strong as white oak. The\r\ngrain is very fine, even, and homogeneous, except as interfered with\r\nby knots. The annual rings are narrow, the summerwood narrow and\r\nindistinct; medullary rays numerous but very obscure. The color\r\nis red, the thin sapwood nearly white. The heart and sap are\r\nsometimes intermingled, and this characteristic is prominent in the\r\nclosely-related western species of red cedar. The wood is easily worked,\r\ngives little trouble because of warping and shrinking, and the heart is\r\nconsidered as durable as any other American wood. It has a delicate,\r\nagreeable fragrance, which is especially marked. This odor is\r\ndisagreeable to insects, and for that reason chests and closets of cedar\r\nare highly appreciated as storage places for garments subject to the\r\nravages of the moth and buffalo bug. An extract from the fruit and\r\nleaves is used in medicine, while oil of red cedar, distilled from the\r\nwood, is used in making perfume. Cedar has a sweet taste. It burns\r\nbadly, scarcely being able to support a flame; it is exceedingly\r\naromatic and noisy when burning and the embers glow long in still air.\r\nSome of the bungalow owners in Florida buy cedar fuel in preference to\r\nall others for burning in open fireplaces.\r\n\r\nIts representative uses are for posts, railway ties, pails, sills, cigar\r\nboxes, interior finish and cabinet making, but its most general use is\r\nin the manufacture of lead pencils, for which its fine, straight grain\r\nand soft texture are peculiarly adapted. The farther south cedar is\r\nfound, the softer and clearer it is. In the North, in ornamental trees,\r\nit is very hard, slow-growing, and knotty. It shows but a small\r\npercentage of clear lumber. In eastern Tennessee there were considerable\r\nquantities of red cedar brake that were for years considered of little\r\nvalue. About the only way the wood was employed a few years ago was in\r\nfence rails and posts, fuel, and charcoal. Of late people in localities\r\nwhere cedar grows in any abundance have awakened to its value, and cedar\r\nfences are rapidly disappearing, owing to the high prices now paid for\r\nthe wood, and the excellent demand. On no other southern wood has such\r\ndepredation been practiced. Because of its lightness and the ease with\r\nwhich it can be worked, it has been used for purposes for which other\r\nand less valuable woods were well adapted. On account of its slow\r\ngrowth, its complete exhaustion has often been predicted, but a second\r\ngrowth has appeared which, though much inferior to the virgin timber,\r\ncan be used in many ways to excellent advantage. Instead of the huge\r\npiles of cedar flooring, chest boards, and smooth railings of the old\r\ndays, one now sees at points of distribution great piles of knotty,\r\nrough poles, ten to forty feet long, which years ago would have been\r\ndiscarded. Today they represent bridge piling, the better and smoother\r\namong them being used for telephone and telegraph poles.\r\n\r\nMiddle Tennessee has produced more red cedar than any other part of the\r\nUnited States, but the bulk of production has been confined to a few\r\ncounties, which produce a higher class and more aromatic variety of wood\r\nthan that found elsewhere. A century ago these counties abounded in\r\nsplendid forests of cedar. The early settlers built their cabins of\r\ncedar logs, sills, studding, and rafters; their smoke houses were built\r\nof them; their barns; even the roofs were shingled with cedar and the\r\nrooms and porches floored with the sweet-scented wood. Not many years\r\nago trees three feet or more in diameter were often found, but the days\r\nare past when timber like that can be had anywhere.\r\n\r\nAlthough the most general use at the present time is for lead pencils,\r\nfew people who sharpen one and smell the fragrant wood, stop to wonder\r\nwhere it came from. One would smile were it suggested to him that\r\nperhaps his pencil was formerly part of some Tennessee farmer’s worm\r\nfence. The best timber obtained now is hewn into export logs and shipped\r\nto Europe, particularly Germany, where a great quantity is converted\r\ninto pencils. The red wood is made into the higher grades and the sap or\r\nstreaked wood is used for the cheaper varieties and for pen holders. The\r\nsmaller and inferior logs are cut into slats, while odds and ends,\r\ncutoffs, etc., are collected and sold by the hundred pounds to pencil\r\nfactories. There are many such factories in the United States now, as\r\nwell as in Europe, and pencil men are scouring the cedar sections to buy\r\nall they can. The farmer who has a red cedar picket or worm fence can\r\nsell it to these companies at a round price. Pencil men are even going\r\nback over tracts from which the timber was cut twenty-five years ago,\r\nbuying up the stumps. When the wood was plentiful lumbermen were not\r\nfrugal, and usually cut down a tree about two feet above the ground,\r\nallowing the best part of it to be wasted.\r\n\r\nThe German and Austrian pencil makers foresaw a shortage in American red\r\ncedar, and many years ago planted large areas to provide for the time of\r\nscarcity. The planted timber is now large enough for use, but the wood\r\nhas been a disappointment. It does not possess the softness and\r\nbrittleness which give so high value to the forest cedar of this\r\ncountry. As far as can be seen, when present pencil cedar has been\r\nexhausted, there will be little more produced of like grade. It grows so\r\nslowly that owners will not wait for trees to become old, but sell them\r\nwhile young for posts and poles.\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest demands for red cedar was for woodenware made of\r\nstaves, such as buckets, kegs, keelers, small tubs, and firkins.\r\nMaterial for the manufacture of such wares was among the exports to the\r\nWest Indies before the Revolutionary war. The ware was no less popular\r\nin this country, and the home-made articles were in all neighborhoods in\r\nthe red cedar’s range. Scarcity of suitable wood limits the manufacture\r\nof such wares now, but they are still in use.\r\n\r\nCedar was long one of the best woods for skiffs and other light boats,\r\nand it was occasionally employed in shipbuilding for the upper parts of\r\nvessels. A little of it is still used as trim and finish, particularly\r\nfor canoes, motor boats, and yachts.\r\n\r\nThe early clothes chest makers selected clear lumber, because it could\r\nbe had and was considered to be better; but modern chest manufacturers\r\nwho cannot procure clear stock, make a merit of necessity, and use\r\nboards filled with knots. The wood is finished with oils, but the\r\nnatural colors remain, and the knots give the chest a rustic and\r\npleasing appearance.\r\n\r\n    SOUTHERN RED JUNIPER (_Juniperus barbadensis_) so closely resembles\r\n    the red cedar with which it is associated that the two were formerly\r\n    considered the same species, and most people familiar with both\r\n    notice no difference. However, botanists clearly distinguish the\r\n    two. The southern red cedar’s range is much smaller than the\r\n    other’s. It grows from Georgia to the Indian river, Florida, in\r\n    swamps. It is found in the vicinity of the Apalachicola river,\r\n    forming dense thickets. Its average size is much under that of the\r\n    red cedar, but its wood is not dissimilar. It has been used for the\r\n    same purposes as far as it has been used at all. One of the largest\r\n    demands upon it has been for lead pencils. Those who bought and sold\r\n    it, generally supposed they were dealing in the common red cedar.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNORTHERN WHITE CEDAR\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NORTHERN WHITE CEDAR]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNORTHERN WHITE CEDAR\r\n\r\n(_Thuja Occidentalis_)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis tree is designated as northern white cedar because there is also a\r\nsouthern white cedar, (_Chamæcyparis thyoides_) and the boundaries of\r\ntheir ranges approach pretty closely. The name _occidentalis_, meaning\r\nwestern, applied to the northern white cedar is employed by botanists to\r\ndistinguish it from a similar cedar in Asia, which is called\r\n_orientalis_, or eastern.\r\n\r\nThe American species has several names, as is usual with trees which\r\ngrow in different regions. It is called arborvitæ in Maine, Vermont,\r\nMassachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey,\r\nPennsylvania, Delaware, Virginia, West Virginia, Indiana, Illinois,\r\nWisconsin, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Ontario. White cedar is a name\r\noften used in Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Rhode Island,\r\nMassachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Virginia, North Carolina,\r\nWisconsin, Michigan, Minnesota, and Ontario. In Maine, Vermont, and New\r\nYork it is called cedar. In New York, and where cultivated in England,\r\nAmerican arborvitæ is the name applied to it. The Indians in New York\r\nknew it as feather-leaf. In Delaware the name is abridged to vitæ.\r\n\r\nThe tree has been widely planted, and under the influence of cultivation\r\nit runs quickly into varieties, of which forty-five are listed by\r\nnurserymen. It is a northern species which follows the Appalachian\r\nmountains southward to North Carolina and Tennessee. It grows from New\r\nBrunswick to Manitoba, and is abundant in the Lake States.\r\n\r\nThe bark of arborvitæ is light brown, tinged with red on the branchlets;\r\nit is thin, and cracks into ridges with stringy, rough edges; the\r\nbranchlets are very smooth.\r\n\r\nIn general appearance the tree is conical and compact, with short\r\nbranches; it attains a height of from twenty-five to seventy feet, and a\r\ndiameter of from one to three feet. It thrives best in low, swampy land,\r\nalong the borders of streams.\r\n\r\nThe wood of arborvitæ is soft, brittle, light and weak; it is very\r\ninflammable. The fact that it is durable, even in contact with the soil,\r\npermits its use for railway ties, telegraph poles, posts, fencing,\r\nshingles and boats. However, the trunk is so shaped that it is seldom\r\nused for lumber, but oftener for poles and posts, the lower section\r\nbeing flattened into ties. A cubic foot of the seasoned wood weighs\r\napproximately nineteen pounds. The heartwood is light brown, becoming\r\ndarker with exposure; the sapwood is thin and nearly white, with fine\r\ngrain.\r\n\r\nThe northern white cedar varies greatly in size and shape, depending on\r\nthe soil, climate, and situation. Though it is usually associated with\r\nswamps in the North, it adapts itself to quite different situations. It\r\ngrows in narrow, rocky ravines, on stony ridges, and it clings to the\r\nfaces of cliffs, or hangs on their summits as tenaciously as the western\r\njuniper of the Sierra Nevada mountains. However, little good timber is\r\nproduced by this species on rocky soils. Trees in such situations are\r\nshort, crooked, and limby.\r\n\r\nThe wood of the northern white cedar possesses a peculiar toughness\r\nwhich is seen in its wearing qualities. A thin shaving, such as a\r\ncarpenter’s plane makes, may be folded, laid on an anvil, and struck\r\nrepeatedly with a hammer, without breaking. It is claimed for it that it\r\nwill stand a severer test of that kind than any other American wood.\r\nToughness and wearing qualities combined make it an admirable wood for\r\nplanking and decking for small boats. Its exceptionally light weight is\r\nan additional factor as a boat building material. The Indians knew how\r\nto work it into frames for bark canoes. Its lightness appealed to them;\r\nbut the ease with which they could work it with their primitive tools\r\nwas more important. It is a characteristic of the wood to part readily\r\nalong the rings of annual growth. The Indian was able to split canoe\r\nribs with a stone maul, by pounding a cedar billet until it parted along\r\nthe growth rings and was reduced to very thin slats.\r\n\r\nThe property of this cedar which appealed to the Indians is disliked by\r\nthe sawmill man. It is hard to make thin lumber that will hang together.\r\nThe tendency to part along the growth rings develops wind-shake while\r\nthe tree is standing. About nine trees in ten are so defective from\r\nshake that little good lumber can be made from them. It is a common\r\nsaying, which probably applies in certain localities only, that a\r\nthousand feet of white cedar must be sawed to get one hundred feet of\r\ngood lumber.\r\n\r\nIt is good material for small cooperage such as buckets, pails, and\r\ntubs, and has been long used for that purpose in the northern states.\r\n\r\nIt was once laid in large quantities for paving blocks. Hundreds of\r\nmiles of streets of northern cities were paved with round blocks sawed\r\nfrom trunks of trees from five to ten inches in diameter. They were not\r\nusually treated with chemicals to prevent decay, but they gave service\r\nranging from six to twelve years. They are less used now than formerly.\r\nSouthern yellow pine has largely taken the cedar’s place as paving\r\nmaterial. Much northern cedar has been used in the manufacture of bored\r\npipe for municipal waterworks, shops, salt works, paper mills, and other\r\nfactories.\r\n\r\nThe early settlers of New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania made a\r\nrheumatism ointment by bruising the leaves and molding them with lard.\r\nThis is probably not made now, but pharmacists distill an oil from twigs\r\nand wood, and make a tincture of the leaves which they use in the\r\nmanufacture of pulmonary and other medicines.\r\n\r\nThere is little likelihood that northern white cedar will ever cease to\r\nbe a commercial wood in this country. It will become scarcer, but its\r\nmanner of growth is the best guarantee that it will hold its place. It\r\nlives in swamps, and the land is not in demand for any other purpose.\r\n\r\n    ONE-SEED JUNIPER (_Juniperus monosperma_) is also called naked-seed\r\n    juniper. Its range lies in Colorado, New Mexico, Texas, Utah, and\r\n    Arizona. It attains its greatest development in the bottoms of\r\n    canyons in northern Arizona. It is a scrawny desert tree which lives\r\n    in adversity but holds its ground for centuries, if fire does not\r\n    cut its career short. Its growth is too scattered to attract\r\n    lumbermen, and the form of its trunk is uninviting. It may reach a\r\n    height of forty or fifty feet, and a diameter of three, but that is\r\n    above the average in the best of its range. The desert Indians make\r\n    the most of one-seed juniper. They weave its stringy bark into\r\n    sleeping mats, rough blankets, and saddle girts. They make cords and\r\n    ropes of it for use where great strength is not required, such as\r\n    leashes for leading dogs, strands with which to tie bundles on the\r\n    backs of their squaws, and cords for fastening their wigwam poles\r\n    together. They likewise weave the bark into pokes and pouches for\r\n    storing and carrying their dried meat and mesquite beans. The\r\n    juniper berries are an article of diet and commerce with the\r\n    Indians, who mix them with divers ingredients, pulp them in stone\r\n    mortars, and bake them in cakes which become the greatest delicacy\r\n    on their bill of fare. White men, when driven to it by starvation,\r\n    have sustained life by making food of the berries. A small quantity\r\n    of one-seed juniper reaches woodworkers in Texas. The lumber is\r\n    short and rough. The numerous knots are generally much darker than\r\n    the body of the wood. That is not necessarily a defect, for in\r\n    making clothes chests, the striking contrast in color between the\r\n    knots, and the other wood gives the article a peculiar and\r\n    attractive appearance. The trunks are sharply buttressed and deeply\r\n    creased. Sometimes the folds of bark within the creases almost reach\r\n    the center of the tree. The sapwood is thin, the heartwood irregular\r\n    in color. Some is darker than the heartwood of southern red cedar,\r\n    other is clouded and mottled, pale yellow, cream-colored, the shade\r\n    of slate, or streaked with various tints. The wood can be\r\n    economically worked only as small pieces. It takes a soft and\r\n    pleasing finish. It is a lathe wood and shows to best advantage as\r\n    balusters, ornaments, grill spindles and small posts, Indian clubs,\r\n    dumb-bells, balls, and lodge gavels. It has been made into small\r\n    game boards with fine effect, and it is an excellent material for\r\n    small picture frames. Furniture makers put it to use in several\r\n    ways, and it has been recommended for small musical instruments\r\n    where the variegated colors can be displayed to excellent advantage.\r\n    At the best it can never be more than a minor species, because it is\r\n    difficult of access in the remote deserts, and it is not abundant.\r\n\r\n    MOUNTAIN JUNIPER (_Juniperus sabinoides_) is a Texas tree, occupying\r\n    a range southward and westward of the Colorado river. It has several\r\n    local names, rock cedar being a favorite. This name is due to the\r\n    tree’s habit of growing on rocky ridges and among ledges where soil\r\n    is scarce. It is called juniper cedar, and juniper. Under the most\r\n    favorable circumstances the tree may attain a height of 100 feet and\r\n    a diameter of two, but it nearly always grows where conditions are\r\n    adverse, and its size and form change to conform to circumstances.\r\n    It is often small and ragged. Its lead-colored bark is apt to\r\n    attract attention on account of its woeful appearance, hanging in\r\n    strings and tatters which persistently cling to the trunk in spite\r\n    of whipping winds. When the tree is cut for fuel, or for any other\r\n    purpose, the ragged bark is occasionally pulled off and is tied in\r\n    bales or bundles to be sold for kindling. When the mountain juniper\r\n    is taken from its native wilds and planted where environments are\r\n    different, it sometimes assumes fantastic forms. It has been planted\r\n    for ornament on the low, flat coast in the vicinity of the Gulf of\r\n    Mexico, and though it lives and grows, it often takes on a peculiar\r\n    appearance. The trunks resemble twisted and interwoven bundles of\r\n    lead-colored vines, buttressed, fluted, and gnarled. The branches\r\n    lose their upright position, and hang in careless abandon, with\r\n    drooping festoons. In winter the wind whips most of the foliage from\r\n    them. The leaves become brittle and may be easily brushed from the\r\n    twigs by a stroke of the hand. Some of the planted trees have trunks\r\n    so deeply creased as to be divided in two separate stems. This very\r\n    nearly happens with some of the wild trees among the western\r\n    mountains. The sapwood of mountain juniper is very thin. The average\r\n    tree cannot be profitably cut into lumber of the usual dimensions\r\n    because of the odd-shaped and irregular trunk. It lends itself more\r\n    economically to the manufacture of articles made up of small pieces.\r\n    Some of the wood is extremely beautiful, having the color and figure\r\n    of French walnut; but there is great difference in the figure and\r\n    color, and the wood of one tree is not a sure guide to what another\r\n    may be. Boards a foot wide, or even less, may show several figures\r\n    and colors. Some pieces suggest variegated marble; others are like\r\n    plain red cedar; some are light red in color, others have a tinge of\r\n    blue. It varies greatly in hardness, even in the same tree. Part of\r\n    it may be soft and brittle enough for lead pencils; another part may\r\n    be hard and tough. Clothes chests have been made of it, of most\r\n    peculiar appearance--resembling crazy quilts of subdued colors.\r\n    Sometimes the heartwood and the sapwood are inextricably mixed, both\r\n    being found in all parts of the trunk from the heart out. On the\r\n    whole, the tree can never have much importance as a source of\r\n    lumber, but it is a most interesting member of the cedar group.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOUTHERN WHITE CEDAR\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SOUTHERN WHITE CEDAR]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOUTHERN WHITE CEDAR\r\n\r\n(_Chamæcyparis Thyoides_)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis tree is called southern white cedar to distinguish it from northern\r\nwhite cedar or arborvitæ. When there is little likelihood of confusion,\r\nthe name white cedar is applied locally in different parts of its range\r\nfrom Massachusetts to Florida. It is a persistent swamp tree and on that\r\naccount has been called swamp cedar; but that name alone would not\r\ndistinguish it from the northern white cedar, for both grow in swamps;\r\nbut it does separate it from red cedar which keeps away from swamps. The\r\nranges of the two are side by side from New England to Florida. Post\r\ncedar is a common name for it in Delaware and New Jersey, because of the\r\nimportant place it has long filled as fence material; but again, the\r\nname does not set it apart from red cedar or northern white cedar, for\r\nboth are used for posts. The only name thus far applied, which clearly\r\ndistinguishes it from associated cedars, is southern white cedar. Its\r\nrange extends northward to Maine, but the tree’s chief commercial\r\nimportance has been in New Jersey and southward to North Carolina, very\r\nnear the coast. Somehow, it seems to skip Georgia where no one has\r\nreported it for many years, though there is historical evidence that it\r\nonce grew in that state. It grows as far west as Mississippi, but is\r\nscarce.\r\n\r\nThe small leaves remain green two years and then turn brown but adhere\r\nto the branches several years longer. The fruit is about one-fourth inch\r\nin diameter, and the small seeds are equipped with wings.\r\n\r\nThe wood is among the lightest in this country. It is only moderately\r\nstrong and stiff. The tree usually grows slowly. Fifty years may be\r\nrequired to produce a fence post, but under favorable conditions results\r\nsomewhat better than that may be expected. The summerwood of the yearly\r\nring is narrow, dark in color, and conspicuous, making the counting of\r\nthe rings an easy matter. The medullary rays are numerous but thin. When\r\nthe sap is cut tangentially in very thin layers it is white and\r\nsemi-transparent, presenting somewhat the appearance of oiled paper. The\r\nheartwood is light brown, tinged with red, growing darker with exposure.\r\nThe wood is easily worked, and is very durable in contact with the soil.\r\nFence posts of this wood have been reported to stand fifty years, and\r\nshingles are said to last longer. Trees reach a height of eighty feet\r\nand diameter of four; but such are of the largest size. Great numbers\r\nare cut for poles and posts which are little more than a foot in\r\ndiameter. Few forest trees grow in denser stands than this. It often\r\ntakes possession of swamps, crowds out all other trees, and develops\r\nthickets so dense as to be almost impenetrable. Southern white cedar is\r\ncut in ten or twelve states, but the annual supply is not known, because\r\nmills generally report all cedars as one, and the regions which produce\r\nthis, produce one or more other species of cedar also. It has held its\r\nplace nearly three hundred years, and much interesting history is\r\nconnected with it. A considerable part of the Revolutionary war was\r\nfought with powder made from white cedar charcoal burned in New Jersey\r\nand Delaware. However, that was by no means the earliest place filled by\r\nthis wood.\r\n\r\nTwo hundred years ago in North Carolina John Lawson wrote of its use for\r\n“yards, topmasts, booms, bowsprits for boats, shingles, and poles.” It\r\nwas cut for practically the same purposes in New Jersey at an earlier\r\nperiod, and 160 years ago Gottlieb Mittelberger, when he visited\r\nPhiladelphia, declared that white cedar was being cut at a rate which\r\nwould soon exhaust the supply. But that prophecy, like similar\r\npredictions that oak and red cedar were about gone, proved not well\r\nfounded. Seventy years after the imminent exhaustion of this wood was\r\nforetold, William Cobbett, an English traveler, declared with evident\r\nexaggeration that “all good houses in the United States” were roofed\r\nwith white cedar shingles.\r\n\r\nAfter boat building, the first general use of the southern white cedar\r\nwas for fences and farm buildings, and doubtless twenty times as much\r\nwent to the farms as to the boat yards. In all regions where the wood\r\nwas convenient, little other was employed as fencing material, and many\r\nof the earliest houses in New Jersey and some in Pennsylvania were\r\nconstructed almost wholly of this wood. Small trees which would split\r\ntwo, three, and four rails to the cut, were mauled by thousands to\r\nenclose the farms. The bark soon dropped off, or was removed, and the\r\nlight rails quickly air-dried, and decay made little impression on them\r\nfor many years. The larger trunks were rived for shingles or were sawed\r\ninto lumber. About 1750 the use of round cedar logs for houses and barns\r\nbegan to give way to sawed lumber. It was an ideal milling timber, for\r\nthe logs were symmetrical, clear, and easily handled. North Carolina\r\nsawmills were at work on this timber many years before the Revolution.\r\nIt was acceptable material for doors, window frames, rafters, and\r\nfloors, but especially for shingles which were split with frow and\r\nmallet, and were from twenty-four to twenty-seven inches long. They were\r\nknown in market as juniper shingles and sold at four and five dollars a\r\nthousand. About 1750 builders in Philadelphia were criticized because\r\nthey constructed houses with no provision for other than white cedar\r\nroofs; the walls being too weak for heavier material which would have to\r\nbe substituted when cedar could be no longer procured. Philadelphia was\r\nnot alone in its preference for cedar roofs. Large shipments of shingles\r\nwere going from New Jersey to New York, and even to the West Indies\r\nearlier than 1750.\r\n\r\nSouthern white cedar is said to have been the first American wood used\r\nfor organ pipes. The resonance of cedar shingles under a pattering rain\r\nsuggested this use to Mittelberger when he visited America, and he tried\r\nthe wood with such success that he pronounced it the best that he knew\r\nof for organ pipes.\r\n\r\nCoopers were among the early users of white cedar. The “cedar coopers of\r\nPhiladelphia” were famous in their day. They used this wood and also red\r\ncedar (_Juniperus virginiana_), and their wares occupied an important\r\nplace in domestic and some foreign markets. Small vessels prevailed,\r\nsuch as pails, churns, firkins, tubs, keelers, piggins, noggins, and\r\nkegs. The ware was handsome, strong, durable, and light in weight. Oil\r\nmerchants, particularly those who dealt in whale oil which was once an\r\nimportant commodity, bought tanks of southern white cedar. It is a dense\r\nwood and seepage is small.\r\n\r\nA peculiar superstition once prevailed, and has not wholly disappeared\r\nat this day, that white cedar possessed powerful healing properties. It\r\nwas thought that water was purified by standing in a cedar bucket, and\r\neven that a liquid was improved by simply running through a spigot of\r\nthis wood. Some eastern towns at an early period laid cedar water mains,\r\npartly because the wood was known to be durable, and partly because it\r\nwas supposed to exercise some favorable influence upon the water flowing\r\nthrough the pipes. It was even believed that standing trees purified the\r\nswamps in which they grew. Vessels putting to sea from Chesapeake bay,\r\nsometimes made special effort to fill their water casks with water from\r\nthe Dismal swamp, where cedars grew abundantly in the stagnant lagoons.\r\n\r\nAbout 100 years ago it was found that whole forests of cedar had been\r\nsubmerged in New Jersey during prehistoric times, and that deep in\r\nswamps the trunks of trees were buried out of sight. No one knows how\r\nlong the prostrate trees had lain beneath the accumulation of peat and\r\nmud, but the wood was sound. Mining the cedar became an important\r\nindustry in some of the large swamps, and it has not ended yet. The wood\r\nis sound enough for shingles and lumber, though it has been buried for\r\ncenturies, as is proved by the age of the forests which grew over the\r\nsubmerged logs. Sometimes a log which has lain under water hundreds of\r\nyears, rises to the surface by its own buoyancy when pressure from above\r\nis removed. This is remarkable and shows how long a time this cedar\r\nresists complete waterlogging. The wood of green cedar has a strong\r\nodor, and that characteristic remains with the submerged trunks.\r\nExperienced men who have been long engaged in mining the timber, are\r\nable to tell by the odor of a chip brought to the surface from a deeply\r\nsubmerged log whether the wood is sufficiently well preserved to be\r\nworth recovering and manufacturing. Trunks six feet in diameter have\r\nbeen brought to the surface. Few if any living white cedars of that size\r\nexist now.\r\n\r\nMany of the early uses of southern white cedar have continued till the\r\npresent time, but in much smaller quantities. Fence rails are no longer\r\nmade of it; shingles and cooperage have declined. On the other hand, it\r\nnow has some uses which were unknown in early times, such as telephone\r\nand telegraph poles, crossties, and piling for railroad bridges and\r\nculverts.\r\n\r\nThe supply of southern white cedar is not large, and it is being cut\r\nfaster than it is growing. The deep swamps where it grows protect white\r\ncedar forests from fire, and for that reason it is more fortunate than\r\nmany other species. Not even cypress can successfully compete with it\r\nfor possession of water soaked morasses. It does not promise great\r\nthings for the future, for it will never be extensively planted. Its\r\nrange has been pretty definitely fixed by nature to deep swamps near the\r\nAtlantic coast. Within those limits it will be of some importance for a\r\nlong time. Where it finds its most congenial surroundings, little else\r\nthat is profitable to man will grow. This will save it from utter\r\nextermination, because much of the land which it occupies will never be\r\nwanted for anything else.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINCENSE CEDAR\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INCENSE CEDAR]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINCENSE CEDAR\r\n\r\n(_Libocedrus Decurrens_)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn California and Oregon this tree is known as white cedar, cedar, and\r\nincense cedar; in Nevada and California it is called post cedar and\r\njuniper, and in other localities it is red cedar and California post\r\ncedar. It is a species of such strong characteristics that it is not\r\nlikely to be confused with any other. Though different names may be\r\napplied to it, the identity of the tree is always clear.\r\n\r\nIts range extends north and south nearly 1,000 miles, from Oregon to\r\nLower California. It is a mountain species, and it faces the Pacific\r\nocean in most of its range. In the North it occupies the western slope\r\nof the Cascade mountains in southern Oregon and northern California; and\r\nit grows on the western slope of the Sierras for five hundred miles, at\r\naltitudes of from 4,000 to 8,000 feet, where it is mixed with sugar\r\npine, western yellow pine, white fir, and sequoias.\r\n\r\nIt is a fine, shapely tree, except that the butt is much enlarged. It\r\nhas the characteristic form of a deep swamp tree, but it has nothing to\r\ndo with swamps. Its best development is on the Sierra Nevada mountains,\r\nwhere swamps are few, and the incense cedar avoids them. It occupies dry\r\nridges and slopes, but not sterile ones. It must have as good soil as\r\nthe sugar pine demands. Its height when mature ranges from seventy-five\r\nto 125 feet, diameter four feet from the ground, from three to six feet,\r\nbut some trees are larger. It is not a rapid grower, but it maintains\r\nits vigor a long time. As an average, it increases its diameter an inch\r\nin from seven to ten years.\r\n\r\nThe wood is dense. It contains no pores large enough to be seen with an\r\nordinary reading glass. The medullary rays are so small as to be\r\ngenerally invisible to the naked eye, but when magnified they are shown\r\nto be thin and numerous. The summerwood forms about one-fourth of the\r\nannual ring. The wood is nearly as light as white pine, is moderately\r\nstrong, is brittle, straight grained, the heartwood is reddish, the\r\nthick sapwood nearly white. It is an easy wood to work, and in contact\r\nwith the soil it is very durable.\r\n\r\nThe incense cedar is the only representative of its genus in the United\r\nStates. It has many relatives in the pine family, but no near ones. Its\r\nkin are natives of Formosa, China, New Zealand, New Guinea, and\r\nPatagonia.\r\n\r\nThe name incense cedar refers to the odor of the wood rather than of the\r\nleaves. Those who work with freshly cut wood are liable to attacks of\r\nheadache, due to the odor; but some men are not affected by it.\r\n\r\nThe forest grown tree is of beautiful proportions. Unless much crowded\r\nfor room, it is a tall, graceful cone, the branches drooping slightly,\r\nand forming thick masses. In the Sierra Nevada mountains, within the\r\nrange of this cedar, the winter snows are very heavy. It is not unusual\r\nfor two or three feet of very wet snow to fall in a single day. The\r\nincense cedar’s drooping branches shed the snow like a tent roof, and a\r\nlimb broken or seriously deformed by weight of snow is seldom seen. Deer\r\nand other wild animals, when surprised by a heavy fall of snow, seek the\r\nshelter of an incense cedar, if one can be found, and there lie in\r\nsecurity until the storm passes.\r\n\r\nIt is a tree which does fairly well in cultivation, and several\r\nvarieties have been developed. It lives through the cold of a New\r\nEngland winter. Its cones are about three-fourths inch in length, and\r\nripen in the autumn.\r\n\r\nIncense cedar has filled an important place in the development of the\r\ngreat central valley of California, where it has supplied more fence\r\nposts than any other tree. Posts of redwood have been its chief\r\ncompetitor, but generally the region has been divided, and each tree has\r\nsupplied its part. The redwood’s field has been the coast, the cedar’s\r\nthe inland valley within reach of the Sierras. It has been nothing\r\nunusual for ranchmen to haul cedar posts on wagons forty or fifty miles.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of posts from incense cedar has entailed an enormous\r\nwaste of timber. The thick sapwood is not wanted, and in the process of\r\nconverting a trunk into posts, the woodsman first splits off the sap and\r\nthrows it away. In trunks of small and medium size, the sapwood may\r\namount to more than the heartwood, and is a total loss.\r\n\r\nThe tree’s bark is thick and stringy, and it is generally wasted; but in\r\nsome instances it is used as a surface dressing for mountain roads. It\r\nwears to pieces and becomes a pulpy mass, and it protects the surface of\r\nthe road from excessive wear, and from washing in time of heavy rain.\r\n\r\nApproximately one-half of the incense cedar trees, as they stand in the\r\nwoods, are defective. A fungus (_Dædalia vorax_) attacks them in the\r\nheartwood and excavates pits throughout the length of the trunks. The\r\ngalleries resemble the work of ants, and as ants often take possession\r\nof them and probably enlarge them, it is quite generally believed that\r\nthe pits are due to ants. The excavations are frequently filled with\r\ndry, brown dust, sometimes packed very hard and tight. The cedar thus\r\naffected resembles “pecky cypress,” and it is believed that the same\r\nspecies of fungus, or a closely related species, is responsible for the\r\ninjury to both cypress in the South and incense cedar on the Pacific\r\ncoast. It is not generally regarded by users of cedar posts that the\r\nhoney-combed condition of the wood lessens the service which the post\r\nwill give, unless by weakening it and causing it to break, or by\r\nrendering it less able to hold the staples of wire fences, or nails of\r\nplank and picket fences.\r\n\r\nPost makers often prefer fire-killed timber. If a tree is found with the\r\nsapwood consumed, as is not unusual, it is nearly always free from\r\nfungous attack. The reason it stands through the fire which burns the\r\nsapwood off, is that the heart is sound--if it were not sound, the whole\r\ntree would be consumed.\r\n\r\nThe wood of the incense cedar is serviceable for many purposes. The\r\nrejection of the sapwood by so many users is the most discouraging\r\nfeature. The heart, when free from fungus, is a fine, attractive\r\nmaterial that does not suffer in comparison with the other cedars,\r\nthough it may not equal some of them for particular purposes. Tests show\r\nit fit for lead pencils, and recent purchases of large quantities have\r\nbeen made by pencil makers. Clothes chests and wardrobes are\r\nmanufactured from this wood on the assumption that the odor will keep\r\nmoths out of furs and other clothing stored within. It has been used for\r\ncigar boxes, but has not in all instances proven satisfactory. The odor\r\nof the wood is objected to by some smokers. Another objection and a\r\nsomewhat peculiar one, has been filed against incense cedar as a cigar\r\nbox material. It is claimed that the boxes are attacked voraciously by\r\nrats which gnaw the wood, to which they are doubtless attracted by the\r\nodor.\r\n\r\nSawmills turn out incense cedar lumber which is worked into frames for\r\ndoors and windows, and doors are made of it, and also interior finish.\r\nShipments of inch boards are sold in New York and Boston, and exports go\r\nto London, Paris, and Berlin.\r\n\r\nThe long period during which incense cedar has been used and wasted, has\r\nreduced the supply in most regions, but there is yet much in the forest.\r\nIt is never lumbered separately, but only in connection with pine and\r\nfir; but post makers have always gone about picking trees of this\r\nspecies and passing by the associated species.\r\n\r\nALLIGATOR JUNIPER (_Juniperus pachyphlœa_) is so named from its bark\r\nwhich is patterned like the skin of an alligator. It is called\r\noak-barked cedar in Arizona, mountain cedar in Texas, and\r\ncheckered-barked juniper in other places. Its range lies in southwestern\r\nTexas, about Eagle pass and Limpia mountains, and westward on the desert\r\nranges of New Mexico and Arizona, south of the Colorado plateau, and\r\namong the mountains of northern Arizona. Its range extends southward\r\ninto Mexico. It is one of the largest of the junipers, but only when\r\ncircumstances are wholly favorable. It is then sixty feet high, and four\r\nor five feet in diameter; but it is generally small and of poor form for\r\nlumber, because of its habit of separating into forks near the ground.\r\nIt does best at elevations of from 4,000 to 6,000 feet in bottoms of\r\ncanyons and ravines. The grayish green color of the foliage is due to\r\nthe conspicuous white glands which dot the center of each leaf. The\r\nberries are small and blue, of sweetish taste which does not\r\nparticularly appeal to the palate of civilized man, but the Indians of\r\nthe region, whose normal state is one of semi-starvation, eat them with\r\nrelish. The line separating heartwood from sap in alligator juniper is\r\nfrequently irregular and vague, and like some of its kindred junipers of\r\nthe West, patches of sap are sometimes buried deep in the heartwood,\r\nwhile streaks of heartwood occur in the sap. This heartwood is usually\r\nof a dirty color, suggesting red rocks and soil of the desert where it\r\ngrows. Small articles which can be made of wood selected for its color\r\nare attractive. They may be highly polished, and the surface takes a\r\nsatiny finish; but the wood does not show very well in panel or body\r\nwork where wide pieces are used. The best utilization of alligator\r\njuniper appears to lie in small articles. It is fine for the lathe, and\r\ngoblets, napkin rings, match safes, and handkerchief boxes are\r\nmanufactured from the wood in Texas. Its rough uses are as fence posts\r\nand telephone poles. It is durable in contact with the soil.\r\n\r\nCALIFORNIA JUNIPER (_Juniperus californica_) is called white cedar,\r\njuniper, sweet-fruited juniper, and sweet-berried cedar. Its range is in\r\nCalifornia south of Sacramento, among the ranges of the coast mountains,\r\nand the foothills of the Sierra Nevadas. Its height runs from twenty to\r\nforty feet, diameter one to two. The leaves fall in the second or third\r\nyear. This tree is of poor form and size for lumber. Trunks frequently\r\ndivide into branches near the ground. The wood resembles that of other\r\nwestern junipers, and usually the fine color which distinguishes the red\r\ncedar of the East is wanting, and in its stead is a dull brown, tinged\r\nwith red. The wood is soft and durable, and is strongly odorous. The\r\nsapwood is thin and is nearly white. Fuel and fence posts are the most\r\nimportant uses of the California juniper. Indians eat the berries raw or\r\ndry them and pound them to flour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWESTERN RED CEDAR\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WESTERN RED CEDAR]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWESTERN RED CEDAR\r\n\r\n(_Thuja Plicata_)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the eastern markets the lumber from this tree is usually called\r\nwestern cedar without further description, but that name does not always\r\nsufficiently identify it. There are other western cedars, notably\r\nincense and yellow; but they have not generally appeared in eastern\r\nmarkets. Western red cedar is the name given it when the purpose is to\r\nseparate it from other western cedars. It is the only red cedar in the\r\nfar West, except the scarce junipers which are totally unknown as its\r\ncompetitors in lumber centers. Gigantic cedar is a name which takes size\r\ninto account. It is the largest of American cedars. Trunks fifteen feet\r\nin diameter and 200 feet high are sometimes seen, but the usual size is\r\n100 high, from two to four in diameter. Canoe cedar is a name bestowed\r\nupon this western tree for the same reason that canoe wood is one of the\r\nyellow poplar’s names in the East. It is one of the best woods for\r\ndugout canoes. Botanists have called the tree giant arborvitæ, but the\r\nname never got beyond books. When the people of Washington and Oregon\r\nspeak of cedar without a qualifying term, they mean this species. It is\r\nwidely known as shingle wood or shingle cedar, because more shingles are\r\nmade of it than of all other kinds of timber in the United States\r\ncombined.\r\n\r\nThe western red cedar’s range covers 300,000 square miles, not counting\r\nregions of small or scattered growth. For a timber tree, that range is\r\nlarge, but not nearly as large as some others. It exceeds one-hundred\r\nfold the commercial range of redwood, and probably a thousand fold that\r\nof Port Orford cedar, but its range is not one-third that of the eastern\r\nred cedar, though in total quantity of available lumber it surpasses the\r\neastern tree a hundred fold. Its range begins in Alaska on the north,\r\nand follows the coast to northern California, and extends eastward into\r\nIdaho. The best development occurs in the regions of warm, moist Pacific\r\nwinds, but not in the immediate fog belts. The largest quantity of this\r\nwood, and probably the largest trees also, are in Washington. Abundant\r\nrainfall is essential to western red cedar’s development. It would be\r\ndifficult to approximate the amount of the remaining stand. This cedar\r\ndoes not form pure forests, and estimates of so many feet per acre or\r\nsquare mile cannot be based on fairly exact information as may be done\r\nwith redwood, and some of the southern pines. Though the drain upon the\r\ncedar forests is heavy, it is generally believed there is enough of this\r\nspecies to meet demands for a long period of years.\r\n\r\nNature made ample provision for the spread and perpetuation of this\r\ntree. The seeds are fairly abundant, are light, have good wing power,\r\nand are great travelers in search of suitable places to germinate and\r\ntake root. The tree’s greatest enemy is fire. The cedar’s bark is thin,\r\neven when trunks are mature, and a moderate blaze often proves fatal to\r\nlarge trees; but small ones, with all their branches close to the\r\nground, have no chance when the fire burns the litter among them. Some\r\ntree seeds germinate readily on soil bared by fire--such as lodgepole\r\npine, wild red cherry, and paper birch--but the western red cedar’s do\r\nnot, if the humus is sufficiently burned to lessen the soil’s capacity\r\nto retain moisture. For that reason, this cedar seldom follows fire, and\r\nthe result is that it constantly loses ground. Under normal conditions,\r\nit is not exacting in its requirements; but anything that disturbs\r\nnatural conditions is more likely to harm than help this cedar. In that\r\nrespect it is like beech and hemlock, which suffer when forest\r\nconditions are disturbed.\r\n\r\nTrunks are large but not shapely. They are generally fluted, and greatly\r\nswelled at the base. These deformities develop rather late in the tree’s\r\nlife; at least, they are not prominent in young timber. Western cedar\r\npoles of large size are beautiful in outline; but when maturity\r\napproaches, the trunk grows faster near the ground than some distance\r\nabove; the annual rings are wider near the base than twenty feet above,\r\nresulting in great enlargement near the ground. At the same time ribs\r\nand creases slowly develop, and by the time the tree is old, it is as\r\nungainly as one of the giant sequoias. Its appearance is hurt by\r\ncharacteristics other than the swelled base and the buttresses. While\r\nthe tree is small, the limbs ascend, and maintain a graceful upright\r\nposition. Toward middle life they begin to droop, and the limbs of old\r\ntrees hang down the trunks--the reverse of their attitude in early life.\r\n\r\nThe western red cedar lives to an old age, from 600 to 1,000 years. The\r\noldest are liable to be hollow near the ground. The tree is remarkable\r\nfor what happens after it falls. Often the trunk crashes down in a bed\r\nof moss, which in a few years buries it from sight. The moss holds so\r\nmuch water that the buried log is constantly too wet for fungous attack.\r\nConsequently decay does not take place. Fallen trees have lain for\r\nhundreds of years--as much as 800 having been claimed in one\r\ninstance--and at the end of that time they are sound enough for\r\nshingles. The position of living trees growing upon buried logs\r\nfurnishes the key to the length of time since the trunks fell. The long\r\nperiod during which the moss-buried wood has remained sound has led to\r\nthe claim that western red cedar is the most enduring wood in America.\r\nSuch is not necessarily the case. A good many others would probably last\r\nas long if protected in the same way.\r\n\r\nWestern red cedar is strong and stiff but falls from twenty to thirty\r\nper cent below white oak in these factors. It is light, and the texture\r\nof the wood is rather coarse. The springwood and summerwood are\r\ndistinct, the latter constituting one-half or less of the annual ring.\r\nThe medullary rays are numerous and obscure. The wood’s color is dull\r\nbrown, tinged with red. The thin sapwood is nearly white.\r\n\r\nThe ease with which western red cedar may be worked led the Indians to\r\nuse it in their most ambitious woodcraft. The gigantic totem poles which\r\nhave excited the curiosity and admiration of travelers near the coast in\r\nAlaska and southward have nearly all been of this wood. Some of them are\r\nthe largest single pieces of wood carving in the world. Trunks three or\r\nfour feet in diameter and forty or fifty feet long have been hewed and\r\nwhittled in weird, uncouth, and fantastic forms, decorated with eagle\r\nheads, bear mouths, and with various creatures of the forest or sea, or\r\nfrom the realms of imagination. Before the northern Pacific coast\r\nIndians procured tools from white men they executed their carving by\r\nmeans of bone, stone, shell, and wooden tools, assisted by fire.\r\n\r\nThe making of canoes was in some ways a work more laborious for the\r\nIndians than the manufacture of totem poles. Their canoes were dugouts\r\nof all sizes, from the small trough which carried one or two persons, to\r\nthe enormous canoe which carried fifty warriors with all their\r\nequipment. Such a canoe, now in the National Museum at Washington, D.\r\nC., is fifty-nine feet long, seven feet, three inches deep at the bow,\r\nfive feet three inches at the stern, and three feet seven inches in the\r\nmiddle, and eight feet wide. It was made on Vancouver island, and is\r\ncapable of carrying 100 persons. The capacity of the canoe is\r\nthirty-five tons. Civilized man has produced no vessel with lines more\r\nperfect than are seen in some of these canoes made by savages; but all\r\nthe canoes are not alike: some are crude and clumsy. It is claimed that\r\nlarge cedar canoes of Indian manufacture were early carried from the\r\nPacific coast by fur traders, and New York and Boston shipbuilders took\r\nthem as models in constructing the celebrated clipper ships which\r\nformerly sailed between New York and San Francisco.\r\n\r\nThe Indians formerly made much use of western red cedar bark which they\r\ntwisted into ropes and cords, braided for mats, wove for cloth, used in\r\nmaking baskets, roofing wigwams, constructing fish nets and bird snares,\r\nladders for climbing cliffs, and they even pulped the inner bark by\r\npounding it in mortars, and mixed it with their food.\r\n\r\nWhite men have put western red cedar to many uses, as shingles, lumber,\r\ncooperage, poles, posts, piles, car siding and roofing, boat building\r\nfrom skiffs to ships, and general furniture and interior finish.\r\n\r\nWESTERN JUNIPER (_Juniperus occidentalis_) is a high mountain tree with\r\nall the characteristics belonging to that class of timber. The trunks\r\nare short and strong, the limbs wide-spreading, the wood of slow growth,\r\nand dense. The tree attains a diameter of ten inches in about 130 years.\r\nTrunks ten feet in diameter have been reported, but trees that large\r\nwould be hard to find now. John Muir said that the western juniper lives\r\n2,000 years, and that the tree is never uprooted by wind. The trunk is\r\nusually short, six or eight feet being a fair average, and very knotty.\r\nHowever, when a block of clear wood is found, it is high class, the\r\nheaviest of the cedars, straight grain, soft, compact, brittle. The\r\nsummerwood is so narrow that it resembles a fine, black line. The\r\nmedullary rays are numerous and very obscure. The wood is slightly\r\naromatic, splits easily, works nicely, and in color is brown, tinged\r\nwith red. In appearance, the sapwood suggests spruce. The average height\r\nof the trees is from twenty-five to forty-five feet, diameter two to\r\nfour feet. The range of this tree is in Idaho, eastern Oregon, and\r\nthrough the Cascades and Sierras to southern California. It seldom\r\noccurs below an altitude of 6,000 feet, and ascends to 10,000 or more.\r\nOn the highest summits it is deformed and stunted. Its fruit is eaten by\r\nIndians, and it furnishes fuel for mountain camps and ranches, timber\r\nfor mines, and sometimes a little lumber. The crooked limbs and trunks\r\nare made into corral fences where better material cannot be had. The\r\nwood has been found suitable for lead pencils, but that of proper\r\nquality is too scarce to attract manufacturers. Other names for this\r\ntree are juniper cedar, yellow cedar, western cedar, western red cedar,\r\nand western juniper. Some of these names are applied to other species of\r\nthe same region.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPORT ORFORD CEDAR\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PORT ORFORD CEDAR]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPORT ORFORD CEDAR\r\n\r\n(_Chamæcyparis Lawsoniana_)\r\n\r\n\r\nPort Orford cedar of the northwestern coast is an interesting member of\r\nthe cedar group with a very limited range. Specimens are found\r\nthroughout an area of about 10,000 square miles, but the district\r\nmoderately heavily timbered does not exceed 300 or 400 miles in area. It\r\nlies near Coos bay in southwestern Oregon. The tree is found as far\r\nsouth in California as the mouth of Klamath river, and it was once\r\nreported on Mt. Shasta, but it is very scarce there if it exists at all.\r\nIn the best of its range Port Orford cedar runs 20,000 feet to the acre,\r\nand a single acre has yielded 100,000 feet. Trees run from 135 to 175\r\nfeet in height and three to seven in diameter. The largest on record\r\nwere about 200 feet high and twelve in diameter. Few trees of any\r\nspecies have smaller leaves. They often are only one-sixteenth of an\r\ninch in length. They die the third year and change to a bright brown.\r\nThe cones are about one-third of an inch in diameter. Two or four seeds\r\nlie under each fertile cone scale, and ripen in September and October.\r\nThe seeds are one-eighth inch in length, and are winged for flight. The\r\nbark of the tree is much thicker than of most cedars, being ten inches\r\nnear the base of large trees. This ought to protect the trunks against\r\nfire but it falls short of expectations. About sixty years ago much of\r\nthe finest timber was killed by a great fire which swept the region.\r\nSome of the dead trunks stood forty years without exhibiting much\r\nevidence of decay, and those that fell remained sound many years.\r\n\r\nThe whole history of this interesting tree, from its first announced\r\ndiscovery by white men until the present time, is embraced in the memory\r\nof living men. It had not been heard of prior to 1855. Though fire and\r\nstorm have destroyed large quantities, it has been estimated that\r\n4,000,000,000 feet of merchantable timber remain, an average of 15,000\r\nfeet per acre for an area of 400 square miles. The wood is moderately\r\nlight, is nearly as strong as white oak, and falls only sixteen per cent\r\nbelow it in stiffness. The annual rings are generally narrow, but\r\ndistinct. The summerwood is narrow, but dark in color in the heartwood.\r\nThe medullary rays are numerous and obscure. The wood abounds in odorous\r\nresin. The odor persists long after the wood has ceased to be fresh.\r\nWorkmen in mills where this cedar is cut, and on board of vessels\r\nfreighted with it, are sometimes seriously affected by the odor. It is\r\nreputed to repel insects, and is made into clothes chests, wardrobes,\r\nand shelves, with the expectation that moths will be kept at a distance.\r\nSeveral other cedars bear similar reputations.\r\n\r\nOne of the first uses to which the people of the Pacific coast put Port\r\nOrford cedar was boat building. The industry was important at Coos bay\r\nat an early day, and vessels constructed there sailed the seas thirty or\r\nforty years. Trunks of this cedar turn out a high percentage of clear\r\nlumber. The wood takes a good polish, and is manufactured into\r\nfurniture, doors, sash, turnery, and matches. The latter article is\r\nesteemed by many persons for the peculiar odor of the burning wood. It\r\nhas been found practicable to finish this cedar in imitation of\r\nmahogany, oak, and several other cabinet woods. In its natural state it\r\nsometimes bears some resemblance to yellow pine, and sometimes to\r\nspruce, there being considerable variation in the appearance of wood\r\nfrom different trees. When the visible supply of Port Orford cedar has\r\nbeen cut, the end will be reached, for not much young growth is coming\r\non. Sixty-eight varieties of Port Orford cedar are recognized in\r\ncultivation.\r\n\r\nYELLOW CEDAR (_Chamæcyparis nootkatensis_) describes this tree quite\r\nwell. The small twigs are of that color, and so is the heartwood. Many\r\ngive it the name yellow cypress. Others know it as Alaska cypress,\r\nAlaska ground cypress, Nootka cypress, or Nootka sound cypress. The name\r\nof the species, _nootkatensis_, was given it by Archibald Menzies, a\r\nScotch botanist who discovered it on the shore of Nootka sound in\r\nAlaska.\r\n\r\nYellow cedar’s geographic range extends from southeastern Alaska to\r\nOregon, a distance of 1,000 miles. It does not usually go far inland,\r\nand consequently the range is narrow in most places. North of the\r\ninternational boundary the tree seldom reaches an altitude of more than\r\n2,000 or 3,000 feet, but in Washington and Oregon it is occasionally met\r\nwith at elevations of 4,000 and 5,000 feet. The species reaches its best\r\ndevelopment on the islands off the coast of southern Alaska and British\r\nColumbia, where the air is moist, the winds warm in winter, the rainfall\r\nabundant, and the snowfall often deep. Well developed trees under such\r\ncircumstances are from ninety to 120 feet high, from two to six in\r\ndiameter. The blue-green leaves remain active two years, and then die,\r\nbut they do not usually fall until a year later. The presence of the\r\ndead leaves on the twigs tones down the general color of the tree\r\ncrowns.\r\n\r\nThe cones are about half an inch long and have four, five, or six\r\nscales. From two to four seeds lie beneath each scale until September or\r\nOctober when they ripen and escape. Their wings are large enough to\r\ncarry them away from the immediate vicinity of the parent tree, and\r\nreproduction under natural conditions is generally good. Yellow cedar is\r\nabundant within its range, but nature has circumscribed its range, and\r\nit shows no disposition to pass the boundary line.\r\n\r\nThe bark is thin and exhibits cedar’s characteristic stringiness. It is\r\nshed in thin strips.\r\n\r\nThe wood is moderately light, and is strong and stiff. It is probably\r\nthe hardest of the cedars, and the grain is so regular that high polish\r\nis possible. Under favorable circumstances trees grow with fair\r\nrapidity, but when conditions are unfavorable, as on high mountains\r\nwhere summers are short and winters severe, growth is remarkably slow,\r\nand twenty years or more may be required for one inch increase in trunk\r\ndiameter. The wood of such trees is hard, dense, and strong.\r\n\r\nThe grain of yellow cedar is usually straight. The bands of summerwood\r\nare narrow, the annual rings are indistinct, and an attempt to count\r\nthem is often attended with considerable difficulty. The wood is easily\r\nworked, satiny, susceptible of a beautiful polish, and possesses an\r\nagreeable resinous odor. The heartwood is bright, clear yellow, and the\r\nthin sapwood is a little lighter in color. In common with all other\r\ncedars, yellow cedar resists decay many years. Logs which have lain in\r\ndamp woods half a century remain sound inside the sapwood. Sometimes\r\nfallen timber in that region is quickly buried under deep beds of moss\r\nwhich preserves it from decay much longer than if the logs lie exposed\r\nto alternate dampness and dryness.\r\n\r\nStatistics of sawmill operations in the Northwest do not distinguish\r\nbetween the different cedars, and the cut of yellow cedar is unknown. It\r\nis considerable, but of course not to be compared with the more abundant\r\nwestern red cedar. Statistics of uses are as meager as of the lumber\r\noutput. In Washington the factories which use wood as raw material\r\nreport only 7,500 feet of yellow cedar a year. Doubtless much more than\r\nthat is used, but under other names. There is no occasion to disguise\r\nthis wood under other names. It has a striking individuality and\r\ndeserves a place of its own. In some respects it is one of the best\r\nwoods of the Pacific Northwest. In nearly every situation where it has\r\nbeen tried, it has been found satisfactory. Its rich yellow presents a\r\nfine appearance in furniture and interior finish, and the polish which\r\nit takes surpasses that possible with any other cedar, with the probable\r\nexception of some of the scarce, high mountain junipers. It has been\r\nused for pyrography and patterns, two hard places to fill, and for which\r\nfew woods are suitable. Indians long ago in Alaska learned that it was\r\nthe best material for boat paddles which their forests afforded. It\r\npossesses the requisite stiffness and strength, and it wears to a\r\nsmoothness almost like ebony. Boat factories have many uses for the\r\nwood, decking, railing, and interior finish being among the most\r\nimportant. It is said to be a satisfactory substitute for Spanish cedar\r\nin the manufacture of cigar boxes, but its use for that purpose is not\r\nyet large.\r\n\r\nIt is said that occasional exports of this wood go to China where it is\r\nfinished in imitation of scarce and expensive woods of that country.\r\n\r\nYellow cedar is a wood with a future. Its splendid properties cannot\r\nfail to give it a place of no small importance in factories and in\r\ngeneral building operations. The supply has scarcely yet been touched,\r\nbut it cannot much longer remain an undeveloped asset. It is apparently\r\na high-class cooperage material, but it does not seem to have been used\r\nmuch if at all in that industry. The same might be said of it for doors.\r\nIt is heavier than spruce, white pine, and redwood, but where weight is\r\nnot a matter for objection, it ought to equal them in all desirable\r\nqualities.\r\n\r\nIn much of its range it is generally exempt from forest fire injury,\r\nbecause its native woods are nearly always too wet to burn.\r\n\r\n    ROCKY MOUNTAIN JUNIPER (_Juniperus scopulorum_) is scattered over\r\n    the mountains from Dakota and Nebraska to Washington and British\r\n    Columbia, and southward to western Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona.\r\n    Except near the Pacific coast, it is usually found at altitudes\r\n    above 5,000 feet. It clings closely to dry, rocky ridges where it\r\n    attains a height of thirty or forty feet, and a diameter of three\r\n    feet or less. The trunk usually divides near the ground into several\r\n    stems. The bright blue berries ripen the second year. The wood\r\n    resembles that of red cedar, and is used in the same way, as far as\r\n    it is used at all. It is not a source of lumber. A little is sawed\r\n    occasionally on mountain mills, and the lumber is used locally in\r\n    house building, particularly for window and door frames; but sawlogs\r\n    are short, and because of their poor form, the output of lumber is\r\n    negligible. Some of it finds its way into Texas where it is\r\n    manufactured into clothes chests and wardrobes, and these are sold\r\n    as red cedar. A choice mountain juniper log, with large, sound\r\n    heartwood, produces lumber with a delicate grain and is more\r\n    attractive than red cedar when made into chests and boxes. By habit\r\n    of growth, it includes patches of white sapwood in the darker\r\n    heartwood. When these are sawed through in converting the logs into\r\n    boards, the islands of white wood scattered over the surface produce\r\n    a unique effect not wanting in artistic value. Some of the other\r\n    western junipers possess similar characteristics. Sometimes patches\r\n    of bark are also found imbedded in the interior of the trees.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRED SPRUCE\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RED SPRUCE]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRED SPRUCE\r\n\r\n(_Picea Rubens_)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn New York the tree is called yellow spruce, while in foreign\r\nliterature it is known as North American red spruce. The tree is\r\nsometimes difficult to distinguish from black spruce (_Picea nigra_),\r\nthe main points of difference in the appearance of the two trees being\r\nthe size and shape of the cones and of the staminate blossoms. The cones\r\nof red spruce are larger than those of black, and they mature and drop\r\nfrom the branches during their first winter, while those of the latter\r\nnamed species frequently remain on the trees for several seasons.\r\nCertain eminent botanists incline to the belief that the two are\r\ndifferent varieties of one species, inasmuch as even the timber of red\r\nspruce bears a close resemblance to that of the black spruce. Other\r\nbotanists dispute this theory, saying that the trees are entirely\r\ndifferent in appearance; that the red spruce is a light olive-green,\r\nwhile black spruce is inclined to a darker olive with perhaps a purplish\r\ntinge, so that when seen together they have no resemblance in point of\r\ncolor. They further say that the cones are not only different in size\r\nbut that the scales are quite unlike in texture, those of black spruce\r\nbeing much thinner and more brittle. The same authorities maintain that\r\nthe tiny twigs of red spruce are more conspicuous on account of their\r\nreddish tinge.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking the principal spruce growth of northern New England\r\nand New York is black spruce, although interspersed with it in some\r\nlocalities is a considerable quantity of red spruce. On the contrary the\r\nchief stand of spruce in West Virginia, Virginia, western North\r\nCarolina, and eastern Tennessee and the other high altitudes over the\r\nSouth Carolina line, is largely red spruce. This botanical analysis of\r\nthe two species of wood is based entirely on the authority of botanists,\r\nbut from the viewpoint of the average lumberman there is absolutely no\r\ndifference between red and black spruce and none in the physics of the\r\ntwo woods except that which rises from varying conditions of growth as\r\nsoil, rainfall, altitude or latitude, or general environment. The larger\r\nspruce of West Virginia and the mountain region farther south, has\r\ncertain qualities of strength and texture, combined with a large\r\npercentage of clear lumber that is not approximated by the spruce of New\r\nEngland and the British maritime provinces. In shape the tree is\r\npyramidal, with spreading branches. It reaches a height of from seventy\r\nto a hundred feet. Its bark is reddish brown, slightly scaly. The twigs\r\nare light colored when young and are covered with tiny hairs. The leaves\r\nare thickly clustered along the branches, and are simple and slender,\r\npointed at the apex. They become lustrous at maturity. The staminate\r\nflowers are oval, bright red in color; the pistillate ones are oblong,\r\nwith thin rounded scales. The fruit of the red spruce is a cone, from\r\none to two and a half inches in length; it is green when young, turning\r\ndark with age, and falling from the branches when the scales open. The\r\nseeds are dark brown, and winged.\r\n\r\nFormerly spruce was little thought of for lumber and manufacturing\r\npurposes in this country, though some use was made of it from the\r\nearliest settlements in the regions where it grew. White pine could\r\ngenerally be had where spruce was abundant, and the former wood was\r\npreferred. As pine became scarce, spruce was worked in for a number of\r\npurposes. The tree’s form is all that a sawmill man could desire. The\r\ntrunk has more knots than white pine, for the reason that limbs are a\r\nlonger time in dying and in dropping off; but knots are small and\r\ngenerally sound. By careful culling, a moderate amount of clear lumber\r\nmay be obtained. The wood is light, soft, narrow-ringed, strong in\r\nproportion to its weight, elastic, and its color is pale with a slight\r\ntinge of red, the sapwood whiter and usually about two inches thick. The\r\ncontrast between heart and sapwood is not strong. The medullary rays are\r\nnumerous, but small and obscure. The summerwood is thin and not\r\nconspicuous. It is the wood’s red tinge which gives the tree its\r\ncommercial name.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that the yearly cut of red spruce in the United States\r\nfor lumber is about 500,000,000 feet, one-half of which comes from West\r\nVirginia and southward, where this species reaches its highest\r\ndevelopment; and the pulpwood cut in the same region is about one-tenth\r\nas much in quantity. The long fiber and white color of spruce make it\r\none of the most satisfactory woods for pulp in this country. Red spruce\r\nis only one of several species of spruce which contribute to the supply.\r\nThe total output of spruce pulpwood in the United States yearly is\r\nequivalent to about 1,000,000,000 feet of lumber.\r\n\r\nRed spruce lumber has a long list of uses. Much flooring is made of it,\r\nand it wears well, but not as well as hard pine from the South. It is\r\nmore used for shipping boxes in the northeastern part of the United\r\nStates than any other wood, except white pine. Its good stenciling\r\nqualities recommend it. Manufacturers of sash, doors, and blinds find it\r\nexcellent material, combining lightness, strength, and small tendency to\r\nwarp, shrink, or swell. Coopers make buckets, tubs, kegs, and churns of\r\nit; manufacturers of refrigerators use it for doors and frames; and\r\nmakers of furniture use it for many interior parts of bureaus, tables,\r\nand sideboards. Textile mills use spruce clothboards as center pieces\r\nround which to wind fabrics; and a further use in mills is for bobbins.\r\nIt has many places in boat building, notably as spars and yards; and\r\nfor window and door frames.\r\n\r\nThe makers of piano frames employ red spruce for certain parts; but as\r\nmaterial for musical instruments its most important use is as sounding\r\nboards. All the commercial spruces are so used. Wood for this purpose\r\nmust be free from defects of all kinds, and of straight and even grain.\r\nThe sounding board’s value lies in its ability to vibrate in unison with\r\nthe strings of the instrument. Spruce has no superior for that place.\r\n\r\nRed spruce bears abundance of seeds, the best on the highest branches.\r\nThe seeds are winged, and the wind scatters them. They germinate best on\r\nhumus. In spruce forests, clumps of seedlings are often seen where logs\r\nhave decayed and fallen to dust. Seedlings do not thrive on mineral\r\nsoil, and for that reason red spruce makes a poor showing where fires\r\nhave burned. It does not spread vigorously in old fields as white pine\r\ndoes. It must have forest conditions or it will do little good. For that\r\nreason it does not promise great things for the future. It grows very\r\nslowly, and land owners prefer white pine, where that species will grow.\r\nIf spruce is to be planted, most persons prefer Norway spruce (_Picea\r\nexcelsa_) of Europe. It grows faster than native spruces. It is the\r\nspruce usually seen in door yards and parks.\r\n\r\n    BLACK SPRUCE (_Picea mariana_) grows much farther north than red\r\n    spruce, but the two species mingle in a region of 100,000 square\r\n    miles or more northward of Pennsylvania and in New England and\r\n    southern and eastern Canada. Black spruce grows from Labrador to the\r\n    valley of the Mackenzie river, almost to the arctic circle. It is\r\n    found as far south as the Lake States where it constitutes the\r\n    principal spruce of commerce. In some of the swamps of northern\r\n    Minnesota and in the neighboring parts of Canada it is little more\r\n    than a shrub, and trees three or four feet high bear cones. On\r\n    better land in that region the tree is large enough for sawlogs. It\r\n    passes under several names, among which are double spruce, blue\r\n    spruce, white spruce, and water spruce. The common name black spruce\r\n    probably refers to the general appearance of the crown. The small\r\n    cones (the smallest of the spruces) adhere to the branches many\r\n    years, and give a ragged, black appearance to the tree when seen\r\n    from a distance. The wood is as white as other spruces. Trees vary\r\n    greatly in size. The best are 100 feet high and two and a half feet\r\n    in diameter; but the average size is about thirty feet high and\r\n    twelve inches in diameter. That size is not attractive to lumbermen;\r\n    but cutters of pulpwood find it valuable and convenient, and much of\r\n    it is manufactured into paper. The wood weighs 28.57 pounds per\r\n    cubic foot, and is moderately strong, and high in elasticity. It is\r\n    pale yellow-white with thin sapwood. In Manitoba, lumber is sawed\r\n    from black spruce, and it is cut also in the Lake States, but it is\r\n    preferred for pulp. It gives excellent service as canoe paddles.\r\n    Spruce chewing gum is made of resinous exudations from this tree,\r\n    and is an article of considerable importance. Spruce beer is another\r\n    by-product which has long been manufactured in New England and the\r\n    eastern Canadian provinces. It was made in Newfoundland three\r\n    hundred years ago and has been bought and sold in the markets of\r\n    that region ever since. Fishing vessels carry supplies of the\r\n    beverage on long voyages as a preventive of scurvy. The beer is\r\n    made by boiling leaves and twigs, and adding molasses to the\r\n    concoction which is allowed to pass through mild fermentation.\r\n    Foresters will probably never pay much attention to black spruce\r\n    because other species promise more profit. It is little planted for\r\n    ornamental purposes, as it does not grow rapidly, is of poor form,\r\n    and the accumulation of dead cones on the branches gives it a poor\r\n    appearance. Besides, planted trees do not live long.\r\n\r\n    WHITE SPRUCE (_Picea canadensis_) is of more importance in Canada\r\n    than in the United States, because more abundant. It is one of the\r\n    most plentiful timber trees of Alaska, and it is found west to\r\n    Bering strait and north of the arctic circle. It is said to approach\r\n    within twenty miles of the Arctic ocean. Its eastern limit is in\r\n    Labrador, its southern in the northern tier of states from Maine to\r\n    Idaho. A little of this species is cut for lumber in northern New\r\n    England and in upper Michigan, and westward, just south of the\r\n    Canadian line. The light blue-green foliage gives the tree its name.\r\n    It is known by other names as well, single spruce, bog spruce, skunk\r\n    spruce, cat spruce, double spruce, and pine. Some of its names are\r\n    due to the odor of its foliage. The largest trees are 100 feet high\r\n    and three in diameter, but most are smaller. Having a range so\r\n    extensive, and in climates and situations so different, the tree\r\n    naturally varies greatly in size and form. The wood of\r\n    well-developed trees is white and handsome, the thin, pencil-like\r\n    bands of summerwood having a slightly darker tone than the\r\n    springwood. The two parts of the annual ring possess different\r\n    degrees of hardness. The springwood is softer than the summerwood.\r\n    The medullary rays are numerous, and the surface of quarter-sawed\r\n    lumber has a silvery appearance, due to the exposed flat surfaces of\r\n    the rays. In the markets, no distinction is made between white\r\n    spruce lumber, and that cut from other species. The uses of the\r\n    different species are much the same. As a pulpwood, white spruce is\r\n    in demand wherever it is available. The largest output in the United\r\n    States comes from northern New England. The tree is often planted\r\n    for ornamental purposes in Europe and in northern states. When grown\r\n    in the open, the crown is pyramidal, like that of balsam fir. It\r\n    does not thrive where summers are warm and dry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSITKA SPRUCE\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SITKA SPRUCE]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSITKA SPRUCE\r\n\r\n(_Picea Sitchensis_)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is largest of the spruces. In height and in girth of trunk no other\r\napproaches it. The moist, warm climate of the north Pacific slope is its\r\nfavorite home, though its range extends far northward along the islands\r\nand coast of Alaska. Toward the extreme limit of its habitat it loses\r\nits splendid form and size and degenerates into a sprawling shrub. The\r\nlimit of the species southward lies in Mendocino county, California. Its\r\nrange in a north and south direction is not less than 2,000 miles; but\r\neast and west the growth covers a mere ribbon facing the sea. It climbs\r\nsome of the British Columbia mountains, 5,000 feet, but it prefers the\r\nlow, wet valleys and flatlands, or the rainy and snowy slopes set to\r\ncatch the sea winds. There it is at its best, and the largest trunks are\r\n200 feet high, fifteen feet in diameter, and about 850 years old. All\r\nsizes less than this are found. It is not easy to name an average size\r\nwhen variation runs from giants to dwarfs; but in regions where this\r\nspruce is cut for lumber, the average height of mature trees is about\r\n125 feet, with a diameter of four feet.\r\n\r\nTideland spruce is one of its names. That has reference to its habit of\r\nsticking close to the sea. Its other names are Menzies’ spruce, great\r\ntideland spruce, and western spruce. The last may be considered its\r\ntrade name in lumber markets, for it is seldom called anything else when\r\nit is shipped east of the Rocky Mountains. The name is appropriate,\r\nexcept that other spruces grow in the West, and are equally entitled to\r\nthe name. This applies particularly to Engelmann spruce of the northern\r\nRocky Mountain region; but its lumber and that cut from Sitka spruce are\r\nnot liable to be confused in the mind of anyone who is acquainted with\r\nthe two woods. The name Sitka refers to the town of that name in Alaska.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of this species are usually less than one inch in length, and\r\nin color are light yellowish green. They stand out like bristles on all\r\nsides of the twigs. Cones are from two to four inches long, and hang by\r\nshort stems, usually at the ends of twigs. They ripen the first year,\r\nrelease their seeds, which fly away on small but ample wings, and the\r\ncones drop during the fall and winter. Sitka spruce bark is generally\r\nless than half an inch in thickness. Trunks which grow in forests prune\r\nthemselves well, and are usually clear of limbs from forty to eighty\r\nfeet. The bases of trees which grow on wet land are much enlarged like\r\ncypress and tupelo, and lumbermen frequently cut above the swell,\r\nleaving from 1,000 to 5,000 feet or more of lumber in the stump. Sitka\r\nspruce’s characteristic root system is shallow; but on mountain sides\r\nwhere soil is dry, roots penetrate deep in search of moisture.\r\n\r\nThe wood of this spruce varies greatly in color, but it is usually a\r\nvery pale brown, with the faintest tinge of red. It is a little heavier\r\nthan white pine, considerably weaker, and with less elasticity. The size\r\nof the trunks, with their freedom from limbs, insures a high percentage\r\nof clear lumber when Sitka spruce is manufactured. The tree grows\r\nslowly, the annual rings are narrow, and the bands of summer growth are\r\ncomparatively broad, to which fact the rather dark color of the wood of\r\nthe spruce is due.\r\n\r\nSitka spruce is an important source of lumber. The total cut in\r\nWashington, Oregon, and California in 1910 was about 255,000,000 feet.\r\nIt is below red spruce in quantity of sawmill cut, but above all other\r\nspruces in the United States. The people of the Pacific coast use much\r\nof it at home, but large quantities are shipped to markets in eastern\r\nstates, and some to foreign countries. Nearly 4,000,000 feet were bought\r\nby Illinois manufacturers in 1909, in addition to what was used rough in\r\nthe state. The commodities manufactured of this spruce in Illinois\r\nindicate with a fair degree of accuracy the uses made of the wood in\r\nmost parts of the United States east of the Rocky Mountains and north of\r\nthe Ohio river and the Potomac. Among articles so manufactured in\r\nIllinois are playground apparatus, porch and stair balusters, doors,\r\nblinds, sash and frames, poultry brooders, sounding boards for pianos\r\nand other musical instruments, parts of mandolins and guitars, pipes for\r\norgans, cornice brackets, store and office fronts, decking and spars for\r\nboats, wagon beds and windmill wheel slats, refrigerators and cold\r\nstorage rooms, ironing boards and other wooden ware.\r\n\r\nTwenty times as much Sitka spruce is made into finished commodities in\r\nWashington as in Illinois. That is to be expected, since Washington is\r\nthe home of the tree and the center of supply. A partial list of its\r\nuses in that state will show that the wood is liked at home. Douglas fir\r\nwas the only wood bought in larger amounts by Washington manufacturers.\r\nThey made 55,429,000 feet of it into boxes, and coopers employed\r\n12,000,000 more. The next largest users were pulpmills, while 2,000,000\r\nfeet went into sounding boards, many of which were for shipment abroad.\r\nOther users were basket makers, and the manufacturers of furniture,\r\nfixtures, finish, caskets, veneer, trunks, pulleys, vehicles, boats, and\r\npatterns. Sitka spruce decays quickly when exposed to rain and weather.\r\n\r\nSitka spruce can be depended upon for the future. Though it grows slowly\r\nit may be expected to keep growing. Its range lies in regions generally\r\ntoo wet for woods to burn, and it will suffer less from forest fires\r\nthan trees of inland regions. It is an abundant seeder, and its favorite\r\nseedbed is moss, muck, decayed wood, and wet ground litter of various\r\nkinds. For the first few years seedlings are sensitive to frost, but not\r\nin later life.\r\n\r\nSitka spruce is often planted as an ornamental tree in western Europe,\r\nand occasionally in the middle Atlantic states. The New England climate\r\nis too severe for it.\r\n\r\nENGELMANN SPRUCE (_Picea engelmanni_) was named for Dr. George\r\nEngelmann. It has other names. In Utah it is called balsam, white spruce\r\nin Oregon, Colorado, Utah, and Idaho, mountain spruce in Montana,\r\nArizona spruce farther south, while in Idaho it is sometimes known as\r\nwhite pine. That name is misleading, for Idaho has a species of white\r\npine (_Pinus monticola_). In eastern markets the wood is known as\r\nwestern spruce; but that, also, is indefinite, for Sitka spruce is also\r\na western species and is found in the same markets as Engelmann spruce.\r\nThis tree’s range extends from Yukon territory to Arizona, fully 3,000\r\nmiles. It is a mountain species and is found in elevated ranges. In the\r\nsouthern part of its habitat it ascends mountains to heights of nearly\r\n12,000 feet. It grows in the Cascade mountain ranges in Washington and\r\nOregon. The species’ best development occurs in British Columbia. At its\r\nbest, trees are 150 feet high and four or five in diameter; but every\r\nsize less than that occurs in different parts of its range, down to a\r\nheight of two or three feet for fully matured trees. Such are found on\r\nlofty and sterile mountains where frost occurs practically every night\r\nin summer, and winter snows bury all objects for months at a time.\r\nThough the stunted spruce trees may be only two or three feet high,\r\ntheir branches spread many feet, and lie flat on the rocks. Though such\r\nsituations are exceedingly unfavorable to tree growth, the stunted\r\nspruces survive sometimes for two hundred years, and during that long\r\nperiod may not grow a trunk above five inches in diameter and four feet\r\nhigh. The Engelmann spruce is naturally a long-lived tree, and large\r\ntrunks are 500 or 600 years old; and trees ordinarily cut for lumber are\r\n300 or 400 years old. When the tree is young, its form is symmetrical,\r\nthe longest branches being near the ground, the shortest near the top;\r\nbut in crowded stands the trunk finally clears itself. Engelmann spruce\r\nlumber is usually full of small knots, each of which represents a limb\r\nwhich was shaded off as the tree advanced in age. The wood is lighter\r\nthan white pine, and is the lightest of the spruces, the weight being\r\n21.49 pounds per cubic foot. It is not strong, and it rates low in\r\nelasticity. The wood is pale yellow, tinged with red. The thick sapwood\r\nis hardly distinguishable from the heart. It would be difficult to\r\ncompile a list of this tree’s uses, because in markets it hardly ever\r\ncarries its right name. It is used for fuel and charcoal in the region\r\nof its growth; also as farm timber, and as props and lagging in mines.\r\nWhen it goes to market, it is manufactured into doors, window frames,\r\nsash, interior finish for houses, and for purposes along with other\r\nspruces. Large quantities of this wood will be accessible when lumbermen\r\npenetrate remote mountain regions where it grows. It may be expected to\r\nincrease in importance. It is occasionally planted in eastern states as\r\nan ornament.\r\n\r\n    BLUE SPRUCE (_Picea parryana_) is found among mountains in Colorado,\r\n    Utah, and Wyoming, from 6,500 to 10,000 feet above sea level. It\r\n    attains a height of 150 feet and a diameter of three under favorable\r\n    circumstances, but its usual size is little more than half of that.\r\n    Its name is given on account of the color of its foliage, but it has\r\n    other names, among them being Parry’s spruce, balsam, white spruce,\r\n    silver spruce, Colorado blue spruce, and prickly spruce, the last\r\n    name referring to the sharp-pointed leaves which are an inch or more\r\n    in length. Cones are three inches long, and usually grow near the\r\n    top of the tree. It is not unusual for blue spruce trees to divide\r\n    near the ground in three or four branches. In its youth,\r\n    particularly in open ground, blue spruce develops a conical crown.\r\n    The wood is lighter than white pine, is soft, weak, and pale brown\r\n    or nearly white in color. The sapwood is hardly distinguishable from\r\n    the heart. This is a valuable tree for ornamental planting; but in\r\n    later years it loses its lower limbs, and becomes less desirable.\r\n\r\n    WEEPING SPRUCE (_Picea breweriana_) is of little commercial\r\n    importance because of scarcity. It grows among the mountains of\r\n    northern California and southern Oregon, at elevations of from 4,000\r\n    to 8,000 feet above sea level. The leaves are an inch or less in\r\n    length, the cones from two to four inches long. They fall soon after\r\n    they scatter their seeds. This tree is named on account of its\r\n    drooping branchlets, some of which hang down eight feet. The wood\r\n    seems not to have been investigated, but its color is pale yellowish\r\n    to very light brown, and the annual rings are rather narrow. The\r\n    tree ought to be valuable for ornamental planting, but nurseries\r\n    have experienced much difficulty in making it grow. It grows on high\r\n    and dry mountains where few ever see it, but refuses to become\r\n    domesticated or to grace eastern parks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCYPRESS\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CYPRESS]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCYPRESS\r\n\r\n(_Taxodium Distichum_)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe name cypress has been used quite loosely in this country and the old\r\nworld, and botanists have taken particular care to explain what true\r\ncypress is. It is of no advantage in the present case to join in the\r\ndiscussion, and it will suffice to give the American cypresses according\r\nto the authorized list published by the United States Forest Service.\r\nTwo genera, one having two and the other six species, are classed as\r\ncypress. These are Bald Cypress (_Taxodium distichum_), Pond Cypress\r\n(_Taxodium imbricarium_), Monterey Cypress (_Cupressus macrocarpa_),\r\nGowen Cypress (_Cupressus goveniana_), Dwarf Cypress (_Cupressus\r\npygmæa_) Macnab Cypress (_Cupressus macnabiana_), Arizona Cypress\r\n(_Cupressus arizonica_), and Smooth Cypress (_Cupressus glabra_). The\r\nfirst two grow in the southern states, and the others in the Far West.\r\nBald cypress, which is generally known simply as cypress in the region\r\nwhere it grows, is more important as a source of lumber than are all the\r\nothers combined. It probably supplies ninety-nine per cent of all\r\ncypress sold in this country. Its range is from southern Delaware to\r\nFlorida, westward to the Gulf coast region of Texas, north through\r\nLouisiana, Arkansas, eastern Mississippi and Tennessee, southeastern\r\nMissouri, western Kentucky and sparsely in southern Illinois and\r\nsouthwestern Indiana. It is a deep swamp tree, and it is never of much\r\nimportance far from lagoons, inundated tracts, and the low banks of\r\nrivers. Water that is a little brackish from the inwash of tides does\r\nnot injure the tree, but the presence of a little salt is claimed by\r\nsome to improve the quality of the wood. It is lumbered under\r\ndifficulties. The deep water and miry swamps where it grows best must be\r\nreckoned with. Some of the ground is not dry for several years at a\r\ntime. Neither felling nor hauling is possible in the manner practiced in\r\nthe southern pineries. Owing to the great weight of the green wood, it\r\nwill not float unless killed by being girdled for a year or more in\r\nadvance of its being felled. In the older logging operations, cypress\r\nwas girdled and snaked out to waterways and floated to the mills. Lately\r\nmany cypress operations are carried on by the building of railroads\r\nthrough the swamps, which are largely on piling and stringers, although\r\noccasionally earth fills are utilized. The usual size of mature cypress\r\nranges from seventy-five to 140 feet in height and three to six in\r\ndiameter.\r\n\r\nThe wood is light, soft, rather weak, moderately stiff, and the grain is\r\nusually straight. The narrow annual rings indicate slow growth. The\r\nsummerwood is comparatively broad and is slightly resinous; medullary\r\nrays are numerous and obscure. The wood is light to dark brown, the\r\nsapwood nearly white. At one time specimens of the wood in the markets\r\nof the world were known as black or white cypress, according as they\r\nsank or floated. Much of the dark cypress wood is now known as black\r\ncypress in the foreign markets, where it is employed chiefly for tank\r\nand vat building. Individual specimens of the wood in some localities\r\nare tinted in a variety of shades and some of the natural designs are\r\nextremely beautiful.\r\n\r\nThe wood is reputed to be among the most durable in this country when\r\nexposed to soil and weather. Some of it deserves that reputation, but\r\nother does not. Well-authenticated cases are cited where cypress has\r\nremained sound many years--in some instance a hundred or more--when\r\nsubjected to alternate dampness and dryness. Such conditions afford\r\nsevere tests. In other cases cypress has been known to decay as quickly\r\nas pine.\r\n\r\nHistorical cases from the old world are sometimes cited to show the\r\nwonderful lasting properties of cypress. Doors and statues, exposed more\r\nor less to weather, are said to have stood many centuries. The evidence\r\nhas little value as far as this wood is concerned. In the first place,\r\nthe long records claimed are subjects for suspicion; and in the second\r\nplace, it was not the American cypress that was used--and probably no\r\ncypress--but the cedar of Lebanon.\r\n\r\nSound cypress logs have been dug from deep excavations near New Orleans,\r\nand geologists believe they had lain there 30,000 years. That would be a\r\ntelling testament to endurance were it not that any other wood\r\ncompletely out of reach of air would last as long.\r\n\r\nThe estimated stand of cypress in the South is about 20,000,000,000\r\nfeet. The annual cut, including shingles, exceeds 1,000,000,000 feet.\r\nNew growth is not coming on. The traveler through the South occasionally\r\nsees a small clump of little cypresses, but such are few and far\r\nbetween. It was formerly quite generally believed that cypress in deep\r\nswamps, where old and venerable stands are found, was not reproducing,\r\nand that no little trees were to be seen. It was argued from this, that\r\nsome climatic or geographic change had taken place, and that the present\r\nstand of cypress would be the last of its race. More careful\r\ninvestigation, however, has shown that the former belief was erroneous.\r\nSeedling cypresses are found occasionally in the deepest swamps.\r\nProbably cypress which has not been disturbed by man is reproducing as\r\nwell now as at any time in the past. The tree lives three or four\r\ncenturies, and if it leaves one seedling to take its place it has done\r\nits part toward perpetuating the species. Fire, the mortal enemy of\r\nforests, seldom hurts cypress, because the undergrowth is not dry enough\r\nto burn.\r\n\r\nThe uses of cypress are so nearly universal that a list is impossible.\r\nIn Illinois alone it is reported for seventy-eight different purposes.\r\nThere is not a state, and scarcely a large wood-using factory, east of\r\nthe Rocky Mountains which does not demand more or less cypress.\r\n\r\nThe tree is graceful when young, but ragged and uncouth when old. Though\r\na needleleaf tree, it yearly sheds its foliage and most of its twigs.\r\nThe fruit is a cone about one inch in diameter; and the seed is equipped\r\nwith a wing one-fourth inch long and one-eighth inch wide.\r\n\r\nWhen cypress stands in soft ground which most of the time is under\r\nwater, the roots send up peculiar growths known as knees. They rise from\r\na few inches to several feet above the surface of the mud, and extend\r\nabove the water at ordinary stages. They are sharp cones, generally\r\nhollow. It is believed their function is to furnish air to the tree’s\r\nroots, and also to afford anchorage to the roots in the soft mud. When\r\nthe water is drained away, the knees die.\r\n\r\nCypress is widely planted as an ornament, and a dozen or more varieties\r\nhave been developed in cultivation.\r\n\r\n    POND CYPRESS (_Taxodium imbricarium_) so closely resembles bald\r\n    cypress with which it is associated that the two were once supposed\r\n    to be the same. Pond cypress averages smaller and its range is more\r\n    circumscribed. The name pond cypress, by which it is popularly known\r\n    in Georgia, indicates the localities where it is oftenest found. It\r\n    is the prevailing cypress in the Okefenoke swamp in southeastern\r\n    Georgia. The general aspect of the foliage and fruit is the same as\r\n    of bald cypress. No detailed examination of the wood seems to have\r\n    been made, but in general appearance it is like the other cypress.\r\n    It is said that little of it ever gets to sawmills because it grows\r\n    in situations where logging is inconvenient.\r\n\r\n    MONTEREY CYPRESS (_Cupressus macrocarpa_). This tree has only one\r\n    name and that is due to its place of growth on the shores of\r\n    Monterey bay, California. Its range is more restricted than that of\r\n    any other American softwood. It does not much exceed 150 acres,\r\n    though the trees are scattered in a narrow strip for two miles along\r\n    the coast. They approach so close the breakers that spray flies over\r\n    them in time of storm. Trees exposed to the sweep of the wind are\r\n    gnarled and of fantastic shapes. Their crowns are broad and flat\r\n    like an umbrella, but ragged and unsymmetrical in outline. That form\r\n    offers least resistance to wind, and most surface to the sun. The\r\n    trees take the best possible advantage of their opportunities. Tall\r\n    crowns would be carried away by wind; and the flat tops, with a mass\r\n    of green foliage, catch all the sunlight possible. They need it, for\r\n    they grow in fog, and sunshine is scarce. Sheltered trees develop\r\n    pyramidal tops. It is widely planted in this and other countries,\r\n    and when conditions are favorable, it is graceful and symmetrical.\r\n    The largest trees are from sixty to seventy feet tall, others are\r\n    five or six in diameter; but the tallest trees and the largest\r\n    trunks seldom go together. The cones are an inch or more in length,\r\n    and each contains about 100 seeds. The leaves fall the third and\r\n    fourth years. Wood is heavy, hard, strong, and durable, but is too\r\n    scarce to be of value as lumber, even if the trunks were suitable\r\n    for sawlogs. The Monterey cypress is of peculiar interest to\r\n    botanists and also to physical geographers. The few trees on the\r\n    shore of Monterey bay appear to be the last remnant of a species\r\n    which was once more extensive. The ocean is eating away the coast at\r\n    that point. Fragments of hills, cut sheer down from top to the\r\n    breakers beneath, are plainly the last remnants of ranges which once\r\n    extended westward, but have been washed away by the encroaching\r\n    waves. No one knows how much of the former coast has been destroyed.\r\n    Apparently the former range of the cypress was principally on land\r\n    now swallowed up by the encroaching ocean. A mere fringe of the\r\n    trees--a belt about 200 yards wide along the beach--remains, and the\r\n    sea is undermining them one by one and carrying them down. So\r\n    rapidly is the undermining process going on that many large roots of\r\n    some of the trees are exposed to view.\r\n\r\n    ARIZONA CYPRESS (_Cupressus arizonica_), as its name implies, is an\r\n    Arizona tree. It forms considerable forests in the eastern, central,\r\n    and southern parts of the state, and is found also in Mexico. It\r\n    grows at elevations up to 6,000 feet. Because of the small\r\n    population in the region where this cypress grows, it has never been\r\n    much used, but the size of the trees and the character of the wood\r\n    fit it for many purposes. Its growth is often quite rapid, and the\r\n    timber is soft, light, and with well-defined summerwood. Its usual\r\n    color is gray, but occasionally faint streaks of yellow appear. The\r\n    leaves fall during the fourth and fifth years; cones are small and\r\n    flat; and the small seeds are winged. It is believed by persons\r\n    familiar with Arizona cypress that it will attain considerable\r\n    importance when the building of railroads and the settlement of the\r\n    country make the forests accessible. The wood is durable in contact\r\n    with the soil.\r\n\r\n    SMOOTH CYPRESS (_Cupressus glabra_) ranges in Arizona and is not\r\n    believed to have or to promise much importance as a source of lumber\r\n    supply. Its name was given on account of the smoothness of the bark.\r\n    It is one of the latest species to be given a place among the\r\n    cypresses, and was described and named by George B. Sudworth of the\r\n    United States Forest Service.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBALSAM FIR\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BALSAM FIR]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBALSAM FIR\r\n\r\n(_Abies Balsamea_)\r\n\r\n\r\nBalsam fir is the usual name applied to this tree in New England, New\r\nYork, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Ontario. The\r\nshorter name balsam suffices in some parts of that region, and\r\nparticularly in New York, New Hampshire, and Vermont. Because it is\r\ncommon north of the international boundary, the name Canada balsam has\r\nbeen given it in some regions. In Delaware it is known as balm of\r\nGilead, but that name belongs to a tree of the cottonwood group,\r\n(_Populus balsamifera_) which is a broadleaf species. In New York and\r\nPennsylvania a word of distinction is added, and it is called balm of\r\nGilead fir. Toward the southern limit of its range it is spoken of as\r\nfir pine and blister pine. New York Indians knew the tree as blisters.\r\nThey referred to the pockets under the bark of young trees and near the\r\ntops of mature trunks, in which resin collected. The name balsam refers\r\nto that characteristic also, as does the word balm. In some parts of\r\nCanada the tree is known as silver pine, and as silver spruce. The\r\nsecretion of resin in bark blisters is a characteristic of several firs.\r\n\r\nThe list of names and the locality of their use indicate fairly well the\r\ngeographical range of balsam fir. Its northern limit forms a line across\r\neastern Canada from Labrador to Hudson bay. From Hudson bay its northern\r\nboundary trends northwestward and reaches the vicinity of Great Bear\r\nlake. In the United States it grows westward to Minnesota and southward\r\nto Pennsylvania. It is cut for lumber in eleven states.\r\n\r\nIn a range so large and including situations so various, it is natural\r\nthat the tree should vary greatly in size. In the Lake States the common\r\nheight is fifty or sixty feet, and the diameter is twelve or fifteen\r\ninches. Young balsam firs grow vigorously when the ground is suitable\r\nand their tops receive sufficient light. In lumbered regions in the Lake\r\nStates, this fir gets a foothold in the shade of a dense growth of paper\r\nbirch and other quickly-growing species; and in a few years the pointed,\r\nintensely green spires of the balsams may be seen piercing the canopy of\r\nother young tree tops, and shooting above into the light. This is\r\naccomplished after a struggle of some years in the shade; but the firs\r\nultimately win their way upward, and in a few years they shade to death\r\nmost of their broadleaf associates. If they are in competition with\r\nnorthern white cedar or tamarack, they are not always successful in\r\nwinning first place.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of balsam fir are from one-half to one and one-fourth inches\r\nlong. They are green and lustrous above and silver white below, the\r\nwhiteness due to stomata on their undersides. On young twigs the leaves\r\nbristle out on all sides and are very numerous and crowded together, but\r\non older branches the leaves are more scattered, due to the dropping of\r\nsome of them. It is their habit to adhere to the stems about eight\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of balsam fir possess a pleasing and characteristic odor\r\nwhich is turned to account in a practical way. The small needles are\r\nstripped from the branches in large quantities, cleaned, dried, and are\r\nused for stuffing sofa pillows, cushions, and other kinds of upholstery.\r\nThe odor persists a long time. Much of the collecting of the needles is\r\ndone in summer as a pastime by summer campers in the northern woods. The\r\nneedles are sufficiently tough to stand much wear in pillows, and they\r\nare still odorous when long use has ground them to powder.\r\n\r\nThe cones of balsam fir follow the fashion of all species of fir, and\r\nstand erect on the branches. Seeds are one-fourth inch in length and are\r\nwinged. The wood is of approximately the same weight as white pine, but\r\nit falls considerably below white pine in strength and stiffness. It is\r\nof moderately rapid growth when conditions are favorable, and the annual\r\nring has a fair proportion of summerwood. The yearly rings are quite\r\ndistinct. The medullary rays are numerous, and for a softwood they are\r\nprominent. When a log is quarter-sawed, and the surfaces of the boards\r\nare planed, the wood presents a silvery appearance, but it is too\r\nmonotonous to be very attractive. The heartwood is pale brown, streaked\r\nwith yellow, the thick sapwood much lighter in color. It is perishable\r\nin contact with the soil.\r\n\r\nPulp manufacturers are the largest users of balsam fir. About three per\r\ncent of all the pulpwood cut in the United States in 1910 was from this\r\nspecies. Its use is on the increase, or appears to be; but recent\r\nstatistics relating to this wood cannot be safely compared with returns\r\nfor former years, because the custom of mixing fir with spruce and other\r\npulpwoods formerly prevailed in New England, and it was then not\r\npossible to determine exactly how much fir reached the market. At the\r\npresent time fir goes under its own name, and the output exceeds 132,000\r\ncords, which is equivalent to 105,000,000 feet, board measure, yearly.\r\n\r\nEleven states contribute to the balsam fir lumber cut, but most is\r\nsupplied by Maine, Minnesota, Vermont, Michigan, and Wisconsin. The\r\ntotal for 1910 was 74,580,000 feet. Much of it is employed in rough form\r\nfor fences and buildings, while other is further manufactured by planing\r\nmills and factories. Car builders employ it in several ways. It serves\r\nas doors, siding, lining, and roofing for freight cars. It is not a\r\ndurable wood when exposed to weather. The largest reported use of the\r\nwood in New England is by box makers. Massachusetts alone works nearly\r\n15,000,000 feet a year into crates and shipping boxes. Its uses in the\r\nLake States are more varied. The makers of berry, fruit, and vegetable\r\nbaskets draw supplies from the wood. Some of the product is of thin\r\nsplit slats, and other of veneer or sawed material.\r\n\r\nThe light weight and white color of balsam fir make it acceptable to the\r\nmanufacturers of excelsior. The product is employed in packing\r\nmerchandise for shipment, and to a small extent in upholstery. The wood\r\nfills a rather important place in the woodenware industry, where its\r\nwhite color and light weight constitute its most important\r\nrecommendations. It is sawed into staves for pails and tubs.\r\n\r\nThough balsam fir has little figure and its appearance is rather common,\r\nit finds its way to planing mills and woodworking shops where it is made\r\ninto ceiling, newel posts, molding, railing, spindles, chair-boards, and\r\nother interior finish.\r\n\r\nThe most widely known commercial product manufactured from this tree is\r\nCanada balsam. Strictly speaking, it is not a manufactured article\r\nexcept what is done in nature’s laboratory, and the product is the resin\r\nstored under bark blisters. The resin is transparent, and is employed by\r\nmicroscopists in mounting objects for examination. Little machinery or\r\napparatus is used in removing the viscid fluid from the pockets in the\r\nbark. With a knife the thin, soft blister is slit and the resin is\r\nscraped out. All kinds of claims of medicinal virtue are made for balsam\r\nresin in the region where the tree grows; but the treatment in most\r\ncases effects cures--if any cures are really effected--by appeals to\r\nfaith and the imagination.\r\n\r\nBalsam fir owes a large part of its importance to its abundance. It is\r\nnot exactly a swamp tree, but it does best in damp situations where the\r\nground is moist and cool in summer. Only in periods of protracted\r\ndrought does the ground litter become sufficiently dry to burn fiercely,\r\nand to that fact is due much of the promise of future supply of balsam\r\nfir. That which grows on the dry uplands may fall prey to forest fires,\r\nbut that in the damp flats, associated with northern white cedar and\r\ntamarack, will hold its ground and continue to supply demand.\r\n\r\nBalsam fir has an importance which can not be wholly measured in feet,\r\npounds, cords, or dollars. Many of the choicest Christmas trees which in\r\nDecember go by tens of thousands to the cities, are of this tree. Its\r\nform is almost perfect, being conical, broad near the bottom, and\r\nrunning to a sharp apex. The deep green of the needles, which retain\r\ntheir color from two weeks to a month after the trunk is severed, gives\r\nbalsam Christmas trees much of their popularity. The trees are cut from\r\nMaine to Michigan, and many are shipped across the international\r\nboundary from Canada. The custom of cutting Christmas trees is often\r\ncondemned as a waste of resources. It has been argued that the\r\ndestruction in one month of 1,000,000 young trees is equivalent to the\r\ndestruction of 500,000,000 feet of lumber, because, if allowed to reach\r\nmaturity, they would yield that much lumber. That argument does not take\r\ninto consideration the fact that not one of the young trees in ten would\r\nreach maturity if left to the course of nature.\r\n\r\nWhen Gifford Pinchot was United States forester, a protest against the\r\ncutting of Christmas trees was formally laid before him. It was\r\ngenerally believed that he would declare that the waste ought to be\r\nstopped and would set his disapproval on the practice; but he did\r\nnothing of the sort. He declared that the forests are for the use of the\r\npeople and that they can serve in no better way than by supplying every\r\nchild in the land with a Christmas tree once a year.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFRASER FIR\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FRASER FIR]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFRASER FIR\r\n\r\n(_Abies Fraseri_)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe people who are acquainted with this interesting and somewhat rare\r\ntree have seen to it that it does not want for names. Some of these\r\nnames are both definitive and descriptive, while others are neither.\r\nTennessee, North Carolina, and West Virginia furnish the names. Within\r\nthe tree’s range in Tennessee and North Carolina it is often known as\r\nbalsam without any qualifying word, and that is quite sufficient, for no\r\nother fir or balsam grows within its range. In the same region it is\r\ncalled balsam fir. That is the common name of its northern relative, but\r\nthere is little likelihood of confusing the two species, for their\r\nranges do not overlap much, if they touch at all, which they probably do\r\nnot. In Tennessee the name is reversed and instead of balsam fir it is\r\nfir balsam. It is likewise known as double fir balsam, but why “double”\r\nis added to the name is not clear. Similar mystery attaches to the name\r\n“single spruce,” which is applied to the balsam fir in the interior of\r\nBritish America. The southern Appalachian tree is called she balsam and\r\nshe balsam fir. These names have no scientific basis, and they appear to\r\nhave originated in a desire to distinguish this tree from the red spruce\r\nwith which it is associated. The spruce is called “he balsam.”\r\nArtificial names like these are not necessary to distinguish red spruce\r\nfrom Fraser fir, as very slight acquaintance should enable anybody to\r\ntell one from the other at sight, and to see clearly that they are not\r\nof the same species. Mountain balsam, a North Carolina name for this\r\nfir, is well taken, for it is distinctly a mountain species. The name\r\nhealing balsam is given in acknowledgment of the supposed medicinal\r\nproperties of the resin which collects in blisters or pockets under the\r\nbark of young trees and near the tops of old. In West Virginia, where\r\nthis tree reaches the northern limits of its habitat, it is called\r\nblister pine, on account of the resin pockets. In the same region it is\r\ncalled stackpole pine, because farmers who mow mountain meadows use\r\nstraight, very light poles cut from this fir round which to build\r\nhaystacks.\r\n\r\nThis tree is decidedly an inhabitant of the high, exposed localities,\r\nbeing found entirely in the upper elevations of the southern Appalachian\r\nmountains, either forming extensive pure stands or growing in the\r\ncompany of red spruce (_Picea rubens_), with a scattering of various\r\nstunted hardwoods, as birch, mountain ash, cherry and usually with an\r\nundergrowth of rhododendron.\r\n\r\nFraser fir’s range extends from the high mountains of North Carolina,\r\nwhere it grows 6,000 feet above sea level, northward into West\r\nVirginia, within a few miles of the Maryland line, at an altitude of\r\n3,300 feet. The tree is not found in all regions between its northern\r\nand southern limits. Its best development is in the southern part of its\r\nrange.\r\n\r\nOn the upper limits of its habitat the tree presents a decidedly\r\npicturesque appearance, being gnarled and twisted and plainly showing\r\nthe results of its long struggle for life and development. It is always\r\nnoticeable that on the exposed side the limbs are so short as to be\r\nalmost missing and on the opposite side they grow out straight and long,\r\nappearing to fly before the wind. These limbs are sometimes of as great\r\na girth for five or six feet of their length as any part of the main\r\nstem, and have a singular look, seeming to be all out of proportion to\r\nthe rest of the tree. The older trees are vested in a smooth,\r\nyellowish-gray, mossy bark, which is quite different from that of the\r\nbalsam fir. The bark is thin, about one-fourth of an inch on young\r\ntrunks, and half an inch near the ground on old ones. The leaves are\r\nusually half an inch long, sometimes one inch, and their lower sides are\r\nwhitish, which tint is due to abundant white stomata. In that respect\r\nthey resemble leaves of balsam fir and hemlock.\r\n\r\nThe cones, like those of other species of fir, stand erect on the\r\nbranches, and average about two and a half inches in length. They are\r\nsmoother than the cones of most pines. They mature in September. The\r\nwinged seeds average one-eighth inch in length, and are fairly abundant.\r\nThe Fraser fir grows as tall as balsam fir, from forty to sixty feet,\r\nand the trunk diameter is greater, being sometimes thirty inches, though\r\nhalf of that is nearer an average. When of pole size, that is, from five\r\nto eight inches in diameter, Fraser fir is often tall, straight and\r\nshapely. Its form, however, depends upon the situation in which it\r\ngrows. If in the open, it develops a relatively short trunk and a broad,\r\npyramidal crown. This fir differs from balsam fir in its choice of\r\nsituation. The latter, though not exactly a swamp tree, prefers damp\r\nground, while Fraser fir flourishes on slopes and mountain tops.\r\n\r\nOn the mountains of western North Carolina fir grows in mixture with red\r\nspruce. Sometimes the fir is fifty per cent of the stand, but usually it\r\nis less, and frequently not more than fifteen per cent. Few fir trees in\r\nthat locality are two feet in diameter. They grow with fair rapidity in\r\ntheir early years, but decline in rate as age comes on. It may be\r\nobserved in traveling through the stands of mixed spruce and fir among\r\nthe high ranges of the southern Appalachian mountains that the\r\nproportion of spruce is much higher in old stands than in young. That is\r\ndue to the greater age to which spruce lives. Trees of that species\r\ncontinue to stand after the firs have died of old age. On the other\r\nhand, fir outnumbers spruce in many young stands. That is because fir\r\nreproduces better than spruce, and grows with more vigor at first. In\r\nstands of second growth the fir often predominates. It depends to some\r\nextent upon the conditions under which the second growth has its start.\r\nFir does not germinate well if the ground has been bared by fire and the\r\nhumus burned. Consequently, old burns do not readily grow up in fir. The\r\nbest stands occur where the natural conditions have not been much\r\ndisturbed further than by removing the growth. Fortunately conditions on\r\nthe summit and elevated slopes of the southern Appalachians do not favor\r\ndestructive forest fires. Rain is frequent and abundant, and the shade\r\ncast by evergreen trees keeps the humus too moist for fire. To this\r\ncondition is due the comparative immunity from fire of the high mountain\r\nforests of fir and spruce. Sometimes, however, fires sweep through fine\r\nstands with disastrous results. The destruction is more serious because\r\nno second forest of evergreens is likely on tracts which have been\r\nseverely burned.\r\n\r\nA report by the State Geological Survey on forest conditions in western\r\nNorth Carolina, issued in 1911, predicted that spruce and fir forests\r\naggregating from 100,000 to 150,000 acres among the high mountain\r\nranges, will become barren tracts, because of the destructive effect of\r\nfires stripping the ground of humus.\r\n\r\nThe cutters of pulpwood in the southern Appalachian mountains take\r\nFraser fir wherever they find it, mix it with spruce, and the two woods\r\ngo to market as one. Statistics show the annual cut of both, but do not\r\ngive them separately. The output of spruce, including fir, south of\r\nPennsylvania, in 1910 was 115,993 cords, equivalent to about 80,000,000\r\nfeet, board measure. Most of it was red spruce, but some was fir, and in\r\nNorth Carolina probably twenty-five per cent was of that species. The\r\ntotal pulpwood cut in that state was 14,509 cords of the two woods\r\ncombined, and probably 3,800 cords were Fraser fir.\r\n\r\nThe wood of Fraser fir is very light. An air dry sample from Roan\r\nmountain, N. C., weighed 22.22 pounds per cubic foot. That is lighter\r\nthan balsam fir, which is classed among the very light woods. It is\r\nstronger than balsam fir by twenty-five per cent. The wood is soft,\r\ncompact and the bands of summerwood in the annual rings are rather broad\r\nand light colored and are not conspicuous. The medullary rays are thin\r\nbut numerous. The color is light brown, the sapwood mostly white.\r\n\r\nThis wood is not of much commercial value except for pulp. It is not\r\nabundant, and it is not suited to many purposes. It is suitable for\r\nboxes, being light in weight and moderately strong; but other woods\r\nwhich grow in the same region are as good in all respects and are more\r\nabundant, and will be used in preference to fir for that purpose. The\r\ndecrease in area on account of fires, and in quantity because of\r\npulpwood operations, indicates that forest grown Fraser fir has seen its\r\nbest days. On the other hand, the United States Forest Service has\r\nacquired tracts of land on the summits of the mountains where this\r\nspecies has its natural home, and the growth will be protected from\r\nfires and from destructive cutting, and there is no danger that the\r\nspecies will be exterminated.\r\n\r\nIt is an interesting tree. It contributes to the pleasure of tourists\r\nand campers among the southern mountains. The fragrance of its leaves\r\nand young branches add a zest to the summer camp. The traveler who is\r\novertaken in the woods by the coming of night, prepares his bed of the\r\nboughs of this tree and of red spruce and sleeps soundly beneath an\r\nevergreen canopy. Pillows and cushions stuffed with fir needles carry\r\nmemories of the mountains to distant cities.\r\n\r\nIn one respect this tree of the high mountains is like the untamed\r\nIndians who once roamed in that region: it refuses to be civilized. The\r\ntree has been planted in parks in this country and in Europe, but it\r\ndoes not prosper. Its form loses something of the grace and symmetry\r\nwhich it exhibits in its mountain home, and its life is short. Those who\r\nwish to see Fraser fir at its best must see it where nature planted it\r\nhigh on the southern mountains.\r\n\r\n    ARIZONA CORK FIR (_Abies arizonica_) very closely resembles forms of\r\n    the alpine fir, and may not be a separate species. Sudworth was\r\n    unable to distinguish its foliage and cones from those of alpine\r\n    fir, but the bark is softer. Its range is on the San Francisco\r\n    mountains in Arizona. It is very scarce, and only local use of its\r\n    wood is possible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOBLE FIR\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NOBLE FIR]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOBLE FIR\r\n\r\n(_Abies Nobilis_)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis tree’s name is justified by its appearance when growing at its best\r\nin the forests of the northwest Pacific coast. It is tall, shapely, and\r\nimposing. It often exceeds a height of 250 feet, and a trunk diameter of\r\nsix feet. It is sometimes eight feet in diameter. No tree is more\r\nshapely and symmetrical. When grown in dense stands the first limb may\r\nbe 150 feet from the ground, and from that point to the base there is\r\nlittle taper. It over-reaches so many of its forest companions that it\r\nis sometimes designated locally as bigtree; but it is believed that\r\nlumber is never so spoken of, and that the name applies to the standing\r\ntree only. The Indians of the region where it grows call it tuck-tuck,\r\nbut information as to the meaning of these words is not at hand. In\r\nnorthern California, and probably still farther north, this species is\r\noften called red fir, feather-cone red fir, or bracted red fir. The\r\ncolor of the heartwood and the appearance of the cone, doubtless are\r\nresponsible for these names. There is a tendency in the fir-growing\r\nregions of the West to call all firs either white or red, depending upon\r\nthe color of the heartwood. There are ten or more species of fir west of\r\nthe Rocky Mountains, and to the layman they all look much alike, but to\r\nbotanists they are interesting objects of study.\r\n\r\nThe range of noble fir covers parts of three states, but the whole of no\r\none. Its northern limit is in Washington, its southern in northern\r\nCalifornia, and it follows the mountains across western Oregon. It often\r\nforms extensive forests on the Cascade mountains of Washington. It is\r\nmost abundant at elevations of from 2,500 to 5,000 feet in southwestern\r\nWashington and northwestern Oregon. On the eastern and northern slopes\r\nof those mountains it is of smaller size and is less abundant. Like\r\nseveral other of the extraordinarily large western trees, it keeps\r\npretty close to the warm, moist coast of the Pacific.\r\n\r\nThe shining, blue-green color of the leaves is a conspicuous\r\ncharacteristic of noble fir as it appears in the forest. They vary in\r\nlength from an inch to an inch and a half. They usually curl, twist, and\r\nturn their points upward and backward, away from the end of the branch\r\nwhich bears them. The cones, following the fashion of firs, stand\r\nupright on the twigs, and are conspicuous objects. They are four or five\r\ninches in length, which is rather large for firs, but not the largest.\r\nThe seeds are half an inch long, and are winged. They are well provided\r\nwith the means of flight, but many of them never have an opportunity to\r\ntest their wings, for the dextrous Douglas squirrel cuts the cones from\r\nthe highest trees, and when they fall to the ground he pulls them apart\r\nwith his feet and teeth, and the seeds pay him for his pains. If cones\r\nripen on the trees and the released seeds sail away, there are birds of\r\nvarious feather waiting to receive them. Consequently, the noble fir\r\nplants comparatively few seeds. Their ratio of fertility is low at best,\r\nbut that is partly compensated for by the large numbers produced.\r\n\r\nThick stands of noble fir are not common. It generally is found, a few\r\ntrees here and there, mixed with other species. Sawmills find it\r\nunprofitable to keep the lumber separate from other kinds. It does not\r\npay to do so for two reasons. Extra labor is required to handle it in\r\nthat way, and there is a prejudice against fir lumber. It does not\r\nappeal to buyers. For that reason some operators have called this timber\r\nOregon larch, and have sent it to market under that name. That is a\r\ntrick of the trade which has been put into practice many times and with\r\nmany woods. The purpose in the instance of noble fir was to pass it for\r\nthe larch which grows in the northern Rocky Mountain region. The two\r\nwoods are so different that no person acquainted with one would mistake\r\nit for the other. A recent government report of woods used for\r\nmanufacturing purposes in Washington does not list a foot of noble fir.\r\nThe inference is that it must be going to factories under some other\r\nname, for it is incredible that this wood should be put to no use at all\r\nin the region of its best development.\r\n\r\nNoble fir is of slow growth, and the large trunks are very old, the\r\noldest not less than 800 years. The summerwood forms a narrow, dark band\r\nin the annual ring. Medullary rays are numerous, but very thin and\r\ninconspicuous. The wood possesses little figure. It weighs twenty-eight\r\npounds per cubic foot, which is four pounds less than the average\r\nDouglas fir. It is very low in fuel value, as softwoods usually are\r\nwhich have little resin. It is very weak, and it bends easily. It is\r\nsoft, easily worked, and polishes well. This is one of its most valuable\r\nqualities. It is deficient in a number of properties which are desirable\r\nin wood, but partly makes up for them in its ability to take a smooth\r\nfinish. It is pale brown, streaked with red, the sapwood darker. In that\r\nparticular it is unusual, for most softwoods have sap lighter in color\r\nthan the heart.\r\n\r\nIt has been already pointed out that difficulty is met when an attempt\r\nis made to list the uses of noble fir, because it loses its name before\r\nit leaves the sawmill yard and takes the name of some other wood, and\r\nthose who put it to use often do so without knowing what the wood really\r\nis. It is known that some of it is manufactured into house siding. It\r\nworks nicely and looks well, but since it is liable to quick decay it\r\nmust be kept well painted when it is exposed to weather. It serves as\r\ninterior finish, and this seems to be one of its best uses. It is so\r\nemployed for steamboats and for houses, and many shipments of it have\r\nbeen made to boat builders on the Atlantic coast. It is used for\r\nshipping boxes, and its light color fits it for that purpose, as the\r\nwood shows painting and stenciling to good advantage.\r\n\r\nEuropean nurseries have propagated noble fir with success, but it does\r\nnot do so well in the eastern part of the United States, though it lives\r\nthrough winters as far north as Massachusetts. It is not known to have\r\nbeen planted for other than ornamental purposes. Unless it would grow\r\nmuch faster in plantations than in its wild state, it will be too long\r\nin maturing to make it attractive to the timber planter.\r\n\r\n    WHITE FIR (_Abies concolor_). The whiteness of the wood and the\r\n    silver color of the young branches give this species its name, but\r\n    it is not the sole possessor of that name, but shares it with three\r\n    other firs. In California, Idaho, and Utah it is called balsam fir.\r\n    The branches and upper parts of the trunk where the bark is thin,\r\n    are covered with blisters which contain white resin. In Utah it is\r\n    known as white balsam, as silver fir in some parts of California,\r\n    and as black gum in Utah. The reason for that name is not apparent,\r\n    unless it refers to the black bark on old trees. It has several\r\n    other names which are combinations of white and silver with some\r\n    other term. Its range is mostly in the Sierras and in the Rocky\r\n    Mountain ranges, extending from southern Colorado to the mountains\r\n    of California, north through Oregon, and south through New Mexico\r\n    and Arizona. The immense proportions are reached only in the Sierra\r\n    growth, those trees in the Rockies being hardly above ordinary size.\r\n    In its free growth the tree is reputed to be the only one of its\r\n    genus found in the arid regions of the Great Basin, and similar\r\n    localities in Arizona and New Mexico. It is not distinguished by all\r\n    botanists from the similar species, _Abies grandis_.\r\n\r\n    White fir attains a height of 250 feet and a diameter of six in some\r\n    instances, but the average size of mature trees among the Sierra\r\n    Nevadas is 150 feet tall and three or four in diameter. In the Rocky\r\n    Mountain region the tree is smaller. It grows from 3,000 to 9,000\r\n    feet above sea level. The leaves are long for the fir genus, and\r\n    vary from two to three inches. The tree’s bark is black near the\r\n    base of large trunks but of less somber color near the top. Near the\r\n    base of large trees the bark is sometimes six inches thick. The wood\r\n    of this species is light and soft. Carpenters consider it coarse\r\n    grained, by which they mean that it does not polish nicely. It is\r\n    brittle and weak. The rings of annual growth are generally broad,\r\n    with the bands of darker colored summerwood prominent. In lumber\r\n    sawed tangentially, rings produces distinct figure, but it is not\r\n    generally regarded as pleasing. The medullary rays are prominent for\r\n    a softwood, but quarter-sawing does not add much to the wood’s\r\n    appearance. It decays quickly in alternate wet and dry situations.\r\n    Trees are apt to be affected with wind shake, and the wood’s\r\n    disposition to splinter in course of manufacture has prejudiced many\r\n    users against it. However, it has some good qualities. The wood is\r\n    free from objectionable odor, and this qualifies it as box material.\r\n    Fruit shippers can use it without fear of contaminating their wares.\r\n    It is light in color, and stenciling looks well on it. Its weight is\r\n    likewise in its favor.\r\n\r\n    Trees of this species seldom occur in pure stands of large extent,\r\n    but are scattered among forests of other kinds. Sawmills cut the fir\r\n    as they come to it, but seldom go much out of their way to get it.\r\n    The United States census for 1910 showed that 132,327,000 feet of\r\n    white fir lumber were cut in the whole country, but as several\r\n    species pass by that name it is not possible to determine how much\r\n    belonged to the one under discussion, but probably about half, as\r\n    that much was credited to California where this tree is at its best.\r\n    The fir does not suffer in comparison with trees associated with it.\r\n    Its trunk does not average quite as large as the pines, yet larger\r\n    than most of the cedars; but in height it equals the best of its\r\n    associates, and in symmetrical form, and beauty of color of foliage,\r\n    it must be acknowledged superior. The dark intensity of its green\r\n    crown when thrown against the blue summer skies of the Sierras forms\r\n    a picture which probably no tree in the world can surpass and few\r\n    can equal. Its cones suffer from the depredations of the ever-hungry\r\n    Douglas squirrel which is too impatient to wait for nature’s slow\r\n    process to ripen and scatter the seeds; but he climbs the trunks\r\n    which stand as straight as plummet lines two hundred feet or more,\r\n    and clinging to the topmost swaying branches, clips the cone stems\r\n    with his teeth, and the cone goes to the ground like a shot. A\r\n    person who will stand still in a Sierra forest in late summer, where\r\n    firs abound, will presently hear the cones thumping the ground on\r\n    all sides of him. If his eyes are good, and he looks carefully, he\r\n    may see the squirrels, silhouetted against the sky on far-away tree\r\n    tops, seeming so small in the distance that they look the size of\r\n    mice; yet the Douglas squirrel is about the size of the eastern red\r\n    squirrel. He does not always let the cones fall when he cuts their\r\n    stems, but sometimes carries them down the long trunk to the ground,\r\n    then goes back for another. The squirrel hoards the cones for\r\n    winter, but does not neglect to fully satisfy his appetite while\r\n    about the work. A single hoard--carefully covered with pine needles\r\n    as a roof against winter snow--may contain five or ten bushels of\r\n    cones, which are not all fir cones, but these predominate in most\r\n    hoards.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRAND FIR\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GRAND FIR]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRAND FIR\r\n\r\n(_Abies Grandis_)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn California, Oregon, and Idaho this tree is called white fir, but it\r\nhas several other names, silver fir and yellow fir in Montana and Idaho.\r\nIn California some know it as Oregon fir, western white fir, and great\r\nCalifornia fir. Grand fir is more a botanist’s than a lumberman’s name.\r\n\r\nThe range extends from British Columbia to Mendocino county, California,\r\nand to the western slopes of the continental divide in Montana. The\r\ncoastal growth lies in a comparatively narrow strip. In the mountains an\r\naltitude of 7,000 feet is sometimes reached, the soil and moisture\r\nrequirements, however, being the same. The largest trees are found in\r\nbottom lands near the coast where trunks 300 feet tall and six feet in\r\ndiameter are found, but the average is much less. In mountain regions at\r\nconsiderable altitudes a height of 100 feet and a diameter of two or\r\nthree is an average size. The leaves are about an inch and a half in\r\nlength, occasionally two and a half. They are arranged in rows along the\r\nsides of the long, flexible branches. Cones are from two to four inches\r\nlong, and bear winged seeds three-eighths of an inch long, the wings\r\nbeing half an inch or more in length. The bark of old trunks may be two\r\ninches thick, but generally is thinner. It is unfortunate that the wood\r\nof the large western firs lacks so many qualities which make it\r\nvaluable. It is generally inferior to the woods of Douglas fir, western\r\nhemlock, Sitka spruce and the western cedars, sugar pine, and western\r\nyellow pine. The wood of grand fir is light, soft, weak, brittle, and\r\nnot durable in contact with the soil. Its light color and the abundance\r\nof clear material in the giant trunks are redeeming features. These\r\nought to open the way for much use in the future. It cannot find place\r\nin heavy construction, because it is not strong enough. That shuts it\r\nfrom one important place for which it is otherwise fitted. Box makers\r\nfind it suitable, as all fir woods are, and large demand should come\r\nfrom that quarter. Trunks that will cut from 15,000 to 20,000 feet of\r\nlumber that is practically clear, and of good color, and light in\r\nweight, are bound to have value for boxes and slack cooperage. Trees\r\ngrow with fair rapidity. Annual rings are usually broad, and the bands\r\nof summerwood are wide and distinct. This guarantees a certain figure in\r\nlumber sawed tangentially, but it is not a figure to compare in beauty\r\nwith some of the hardwoods, or even with Douglas fir, or the southern\r\nyellow pines. It ought to be a first class material for certain kinds\r\nof woodenware, particularly for tubs, pails, and small stave vessels,\r\nand as far as it has been used in that way it has been satisfactory.\r\nIt cannot be recommended for outside house finish, such as\r\nweather-boarding, cornice, and porch work, because of its susceptibility\r\nto decay; but it meets requirements for plain interior finish, and tests\r\nhave shown it to be good material for cores or backing over which to\r\nglue veneers of hardwood.\r\n\r\nWhile the eastern states have not yet wakened up to the fact that this\r\ntree is of value in ornamental planting, its decorative qualities in\r\nopen stands have been recognized for some time in eastern Europe, where\r\ntrees of considerable size, promising to attain almost primeval\r\nproportions, are already flourishing.\r\n\r\nRED FIR (_Abies magnifica_) is the largest fir in America. At its best\r\nit attains a height of 250 feet and a diameter of ten, but that size is\r\nrare. It has several names, magnificent fir, which is a translation of\r\nits botanical name; redbark fir, California red fir, and golden fir. The\r\nreference to red which occurs in its several names, is descriptive of\r\nits heartwood. Its range lies on the Cascade mountains of southern\r\nOregon, and along the entire length of the western slope of the Sierra\r\nNevadas in California. It is common in southern Oregon and sometimes\r\nforms nearly pure forests at elevations of 5,000 or 7,000 feet. It is\r\nplentiful in the Sierra Nevada ranges at altitudes of from 6,000 to\r\n9,000 feet. In southern California it ascends 10,000 feet. On old trees\r\nthe limbs, regularly whorled in collars of five, are usually pendulous\r\nor down-growing and are regularly and precisely subdivided into branches\r\nand twigs, the short, stiff blue-green leaves, which persist for ten\r\nyears, closely covering the upper side of the latter. Its cones are the\r\nlargest of the firs, are dark purple in color and grow erect on the\r\nbranches.\r\n\r\nThe cones are six or eight inches long, and three or four in diameter.\r\nThey present a fine appearance as they stand erect on the branches. The\r\nseeds are large, but their strong wings are able to carry them away from\r\nthe immediate presence of the parent tree. The wings are extremely\r\nbeautiful, and flash light with the colors of the rainbow. Old trees are\r\nprotected by hard, dark-colored bark five or six inches thick. A forest\r\nfire may pass through a stand of old firs without burning through the\r\nbark, but young trees are not so protected, and are liable to be killed.\r\n\r\nA study of the wood of the red fir reveals rather more favorable\r\nqualities than the other firs afford. Sap and heartwood are more easily\r\ndistinguished than in the other species, the sapwood being much lighter\r\nin color than the reddish heart. Contrary to the general rule among the\r\nfirs, this wood possesses considerable durability, especially when used\r\nfor purposes which bring it in contact with the soil. It is, however,\r\nlight, soft and weak, but has a close, fine grain and compact structure.\r\nSeasoning defects, such as checking and warping, are liable to occur\r\nunless properly guarded against. It weighs 29.30 pounds per cubic foot,\r\nor nearly three pounds less than Douglas fir. It is used for rough\r\nlumber, packing boxes, bridge floors, interior house finish, and fuel.\r\n\r\nSHASTA RED FIR (_Abies magnifica shastensis_) is pronounced by George B.\r\nSudworth to be only a form of red fir (_Abies magnifica_) and not a\r\nseparate species. The principal difference is in the cones. The Shasta\r\nform was discovered on the mountain of that name in northern California\r\nin 1890 by Professor J. G. Lemmon. It was supposed to be confined to\r\nthat locality, but was subsequently found on the Cascade mountains in\r\nOregon, and also at several points in northern California. It was later\r\nfound in the Sierras five hundred miles south of Mount Shasta.\r\n\r\n    LOVELY FIR (_Abies amabilis_) is known by a number of names, red\r\n    fir, silver fir, red silver fir, lovely red fir, amabilis fir, and\r\n    larch. The last name is applied to this tree by lumbermen who have\r\n    discovered that fir lumber sells better if it is given some other\r\n    name. The range of this species extends from British Columbia\r\n    southward in the Cascade mountains through Washington to Oregon. It\r\n    is the common fir of the Olympic mountains and there reaches its\r\n    best development, sometimes a height of 250 feet and a diameter of\r\n    five or six; but the average, even in the best part of its range, is\r\n    much under that size, while in the northern country, and high on\r\n    mountains, it is a commonplace tree, averaging less than 100 feet\r\n    high, and scarcely eighteen inches in diameter. When this fir stands\r\n    in open ground, the whole trunk is covered with limbs from base to\r\n    top; but in dense stands, the limbs drop off, and a clean trunk\r\n    results.\r\n\r\n    Some of the largest trees rise with scarcely a limb 150 feet, and\r\n    above that is the small crown. The bark of young trees is covered\r\n    with blisters filled with resin. The bark is thin and smooth until\r\n    the tree is a century or more old, after which it becomes rougher,\r\n    and near the base may be two and a half inches thick. It is of very\r\n    slow growth, and a century hardly produces a trunk of small sawlog\r\n    size. The leaves are dark green above, and whitish below. They are\r\n    much crowded on the twigs, those on the underside rising with a\r\n    twist at the base, and standing nearly erect. They are longer than\r\n    those on the twig’s upper side. The purple cones are conspicuous\r\n    objects on the tree, are from three and a half to six inches long,\r\n    and bear abundance of seeds which are well dispersed by wind.\r\n    However, the reproduction of this tree is not plentiful. The species\r\n    holds its own, and not much more. When artificial reforestation\r\n    takes place in this country, if that time ever comes, lovely fir\r\n    will receive scant consideration, because of its discouragingly slow\r\n    growth. It ranks with lodgepole pine in that respect. Nature can\r\n    afford to wait two hundred years for a forest to mature, but men\r\n    will not plant and protect when the prospect of returns is so\r\n    remote. The wood is light, weak, moderately stiff and hard. The\r\n    heartwood is pale brown, the sap nearly white. The summerwood\r\n    appears in thin but well-marked bands in the annual rings, and the\r\n    medullary rays are large enough to show slightly in quarter-sawed\r\n    lumber. Growing as it does, interspersed with really valuable woods,\r\n    the lovely fir is not highly thought of from a commercial\r\n    standpoint. However, it is exploited in conjunction with the other\r\n    species and turned into lumber and general structural material. A\r\n    considerable quantity finds a market as interior finish and other\r\n    millwork. It has many of the properties which fit it for the\r\n    manufacture of packing boxes, particularly those intended for dried\r\n    fruit and light merchandise. It bears considerable resemblance to\r\n    spruce. The utilization of this and similar species of western fir\r\n    for pulp has been suggested, but little has been done. It has been\r\n    planted ornamentally in parts of Europe, but there is no comparison\r\n    between the decorative appearance of this fir and its associated\r\n    species, the others which are in cultivation being much superior.\r\n    Removal from the old habitat militates greatly against its natural\r\n    beauty and reduces it to the level of the ordinary.\r\n\r\n    ALPINE FIR (_Abies lasiocarpa_) is so called because it thrives on\r\n    high mountains and in the far North. It grows in southern Alaska, up\r\n    to latitude 60°, and southward to Oregon and Colorado. Its other\r\n    names are balsam, white balsam, Oregon balsam, mountain balsam,\r\n    white fir, pumpkin tree, down-cone, and downy-cone subalpine fir. It\r\n    grows from sea level in Alaska up to 7,000 feet or more in the\r\n    South. It is not abundant, and not very well known. However, its\r\n    slender, spirelike top distinguishes it from all associates and it\r\n    may be recognized at long distances by that characteristic. It\r\n    endures cold at 40 degrees below zero, and summer climate at 90\r\n    degrees. Trees are usually small, and the trunks are covered with\r\n    limbs to the ground. On high mountains the lower limbs often lie\r\n    flat on the ground, and the twigs sometimes take root. Under very\r\n    favorable circumstances this fir may reach a height of 160 feet and\r\n    a diameter of four, but the usual size is less than half of it, even\r\n    when conditions are fair, while on bleak mountains mature trees may\r\n    be only three or four feet high, with most of the limbs prostrate.\r\n    The sprawling form of growth makes the tree peculiarly liable to be\r\n    killed by fire. The bark is thin, smooth, and flinty; and in color\r\n    it is ashy gray or chalky white. Leaves are one and a half inches or\r\n    less long; the purple cones from two to four inches. Trees bear\r\n    cones at about twelve years of age. The seeds are equipped with\r\n    violet or purplish wings, and they fly far enough to find the best\r\n    available places to plant themselves. The wood is narrow-ringed,\r\n    light, soft, and in color from pale straw to light yellowish-brown.\r\n    It is fairly straight grained, and splits and works easily; but\r\n    trunks are very knotty. Its best service in the past has consisted\r\n    in supplying fuel to mining camps and mountain stock ranges.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDOUGLAS FIR\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DOUGLAS FIR]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDOUGLAS FIR\r\n\r\n(_Pseudotsuga Taxifolia_)\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring one hundred and ten years, from 1803 until the present time,\r\nbotanists and others have proposed and rejected names for this tree. It\r\nhas been called a fir, pine, and spruce, with various combinations, but\r\nthe name now seems to be fixed. Laymen have disputed almost as much as\r\nbotanists as to what the tree should be named. It has been called red\r\nfir, Douglas spruce, Douglas fir, yellow fir, spruce, fir, pine, red\r\npine, Puget Sound pine, Oregon pine, cork-barked Douglas spruce, and\r\nDouglas tree. More than a dozen varieties are distinguished in\r\ncultivation.\r\n\r\nThe range of Douglas fir covers most of the Rocky Mountain region in the\r\nUnited States and northward to central British Columbia; on the coast\r\nfrom the latitude of southern Alaska to the Sierra Nevada mountains in\r\ncentral California. It reaches its maximum development in western\r\nWashington and Oregon, particularly between the Cascade mountains and\r\nthe Pacific ocean. In these Cascade forests, stands are found which\r\nyield from 50,000 to 100,000 feet per acre, and mills in that region cut\r\nthe longest timbers in the world, some two feet square and 100 feet\r\nlong.\r\n\r\nTwo forms of Douglas fir are recognized by botanists, not essentially\r\ndifferent except in size and habit of growth. One is the finely\r\ndeveloped form on the Pacific coast where the climate is warm and the\r\nair moist. The other is the Rocky Mountain form which is smaller and\r\nshows the effect of cold, dryness, and other adverse circumstances. When\r\nthe seeds of the two forms are planted in nurseries, where they enjoy\r\nidentical advantages, the coast form outgrows the other in Europe, but\r\nthe Rocky Mountain form thrives best in the eastern part of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nDouglas fir needles are from three-quarters to one and a quarter inches\r\nlong, and of a dark, yellow-green color. They remain on the twigs about\r\neight years. Cones are from two to four and a half inches long, and are\r\nborne on long stems. The seeds, which ripen in August, are of light,\r\nreddish-brown color with irregular white spots on the lower side; are\r\nabout a quarter of an inch long, and are provided with wings. Trees of\r\nthis species in the moist climate of the Pacific slope average much\r\nlarger than those in the mountains farther east. The largest are 300\r\nfeet high, occasionally more, and from eight to ten in diameter. The\r\naverage among the Rocky Mountains is from eighty to 100 feet high, and\r\ntwo to four in diameter. Young trees are slender with crowded branches.\r\nIn thick stands the lower limbs die and the trunks remain bare, except\r\nan occasional small branch. Douglas fir at its best grows in thick\r\nstands, with crowns forming a canopy so dense that sunlight can scarcely\r\nreach the ground. The result of this is that other species have little\r\nshow where Douglas fir prevails.\r\n\r\nThe bark of large trunks attains a thickness of eight or ten inches near\r\nthe base. Young bark contains blisters filled with resin, similar to\r\nthose of balsam and other species of fir.\r\n\r\nThe wood is light red or yellow, the sap much whiter. Lumbermen\r\nrecognize two kinds of wood, yellow and red. The former is considered\r\nmore valuable. Both may come from the same trunk, and the reason for the\r\ndifference in color and quality is not well understood. It cannot be\r\nattributed to soil or climate, or to the age of the tree, and it does\r\nnot seem to depend upon rate of growth. The bands of summerwood are\r\nbroad and quite distinct. A few scattered resin ducts are visible under\r\na magnifying glass of low power. The medullary rays are numerous, rather\r\nlarge, frequently yellow, conspicuous when wood is split radially. The\r\nwood’s average weight is given by Sargent at 32.14 pounds per cubic\r\nfoot, yet some specimens exceed forty pounds. It is hard, strong, and\r\nstiff. In mechanical properties it rates about the same as longleaf pine\r\nof the South. Elaborate tests have been made to determine which of these\r\nwoods is the better for heavy construction, and neither appears to win\r\nover the other. In one respect, however, Douglas fir has a clear\r\nadvantage over its southern rival: it may be had in much larger pieces.\r\nNo other commercial wood of the world equals it in that particular. The\r\nDouglas fir flagstaff at the Kew gardens in England was 159 feet long,\r\neight inches in diameter at the top, more than three feet at the base.\r\nThe extraordinary size of squared beams cut from this species has led to\r\ngreat demand for it for heavy construction in Europe and this country.\r\nThe pines from the Baltic sea region of northern Europe, which held\r\nundisputed place in heavy work during centuries, has now yielded that\r\nplace to Douglas fir and longleaf pine.\r\n\r\nNo other single species in the United States or in the world equals the\r\nannual sawmill cut of Douglas fir. The four species of southern yellow\r\npines, if counted as one, surpass it; but singly, not one comes up to\r\nit. In 1910 the lumber cut from this fir amounted to 5,203,644,000 feet,\r\nwhich exceeded one-eighth of the total lumber cut in the United States.\r\nThe importance of such a timber tree can scarcely be estimated. The\r\navailable supply in the western forests is very large and will last many\r\nyears, even if the demand for more than 5,000,000,000 feet a year\r\ncontinues to be met.\r\n\r\nThe timber is exported to practically every civilized nation in the\r\nworld. Shipbuilding creates a heavy demand. Some of the leading European\r\nnations use it as deck lining for battleships, and except mahogany and\r\nteak, it is said to have no equal for that purpose. Its cheapness gives\r\nit a decided advantage over those woods.\r\n\r\nEvery important lumber market in the United States handles Douglas fir,\r\nand its uses are so many that it would be easier to list industries\r\nwhich do not use it than those which do. It is manufactured into more\r\nthan fifty classes of commodities, in Illinois alone. Among these are\r\nboats, railroad cars, electrical apparatus, farm machinery, laundry\r\nsupplies, ladders, refrigerators, musical instruments, fixtures for\r\noffices, stores, and banks, and sash, doors, and blinds. This list of\r\nuses shows that its place in the country’s industries includes much more\r\nthan rough construction. It may be stained in imitation of valuable\r\nforeign and domestic woods, including walnut, mahogany, and oak. The\r\nnatural grain and figure of the wood may be deepened and improved by\r\nstains, and this is much done by manufacturers of interior finish,\r\npanels, and store and office fixtures. There is practically no limit to\r\nthe size of panels which may be cut in single pieces. It is easy to\r\nprocure planks large enough for whole counter tops.\r\n\r\nThe best grain of Douglas fir is not brought out by quarter-sawing. The\r\nfigures desired are not those produced by the medullary rays, but by the\r\nrings of annual growth. Therefore, the sawyer at the mill cuts his best\r\nlogs--if intended for figured lumber--tangentially, as far as possible.\r\nIn the state of Washington, which leads all other states in the\r\nproduction of Douglas fir, its chief use as a manufactured product is\r\nfor doors, sash, and blinds, and the annual consumption in that industry\r\nexceeds 50,000,000 feet. It is cut in veneers, and it is likewise used\r\nas corewood to back veneers. Crossarms for telegraph and telephone poles\r\ndemand 35,000,000 feet yearly in Washington alone, and many thousands of\r\npoles are of this wood. It is third among the crosstie woods of the\r\nUnited States, the combined cut of oaks standing first, and the pine\r\nsecond. It is rapidly taking high position as material for large water\r\npipes and for braces, props, stulls, and lagging in mines and for paving\r\nblocks for streets.\r\n\r\n    BRISTLECONE FIR (_Abies venusta_) is pronounced by George B.\r\n    Sudworth to be “the most curious fir tree in the world.” It is found\r\n    almost exclusively in Monterey county, California, but a few trees\r\n    grow outside of that circumscribed area. It has been called Santa\r\n    Lucia fir, because it was once supposed to exist only in canyons of\r\n    Santa Lucia mountains, but its range is now known to be more\r\n    extensive. Monterey county, California, is of peculiar interest to\r\n    dendrologists. Three species of trees are either confined to that\r\n    area, or have their best development there. They are Monterey\r\n    cypress (_Cupressus macrocarpa_), Monterey pine (_Pinus radiata_),\r\n    and bristlecone fir. All are peculiar trees: the cypress because of\r\n    its ragged form and extremely limited range, the pine because of\r\n    its exceedingly rapid growth when given a chance, and the fir,\r\n    because of its peculiar form of crown, odd appearance of cone, and\r\n    extraordinary weight of wood. No reason is apparent why that\r\n    particular point on the California coast should have brought into\r\n    existence--or at least should have gathered to itself--three\r\n    peculiar tree species. Bristlecone fir is well named from the\r\n    bristles an inch long covering the cone. The leaves, too, are\r\n    peculiar, bearing much resemblance to small willow leaves. Their\r\n    upper sides are deep yellow-green and the under sides silvery. The\r\n    largest leaves are two inches long, cones three inches. They ripen\r\n    in August, and soon afterwards scatter their seeds. The tree is not\r\n    a prolific seeder, and it is believed that its range is becoming\r\n    smaller. Bristlecone’s form of crown has been compared to an Indian\r\n    club, the large end on the ground and the handle pointing upward.\r\n    Trees from sixty to eighty feet high have such “handles” twenty or\r\n    thirty feet long. That peculiarity of shape makes the tree\r\n    recognizable among associated species at a distance of several\r\n    miles. The recorded weight of the wood is 42.27 pounds per cubic\r\n    foot, which is nearly twice the weight of some other firs. The wood\r\n    is moderately soft, but very firm. Few uses for it have been\r\n    reported. Trunks are very knotty, and are too few in number to be of\r\n    importance as a source of lumber. The tree has been planted\r\n    successfully for ornament in the south of Europe.\r\n\r\n    BIGCONE SPRUCE (_Pseudotsuga macrocarpa_) is of the same genus as\r\n    Douglas fir and bears much resemblance to it, but is smaller, and\r\n    its range lies wholly outside that of its northern relative. It is a\r\n    southern California species, occupying mountain slopes and canyons\r\n    in Santa Barbara and San Diego counties. It is found from 3,000 to\r\n    5,000 feet above sea level. Trees average forty or fifty feet in\r\n    height and two or three in diameter. The leaves are approximately of\r\n    the same size as those of Douglas fir; but the cones are much\r\n    larger, hence the name by which the tree is known. It is called\r\n    hemlock as often as spruce. The cones are from four to seven inches\r\n    long, hang down, and usually occupy the topmost branches of trees.\r\n    The winged seeds are half an inch long. The bark is six inches or\r\n    less in thickness. The wood is inferior in most ways to that of\r\n    Douglas fir, lighter, weaker, and less elastic. Its color is reddish\r\n    brown. It has never contributed much lumber to the market and never\r\n    will. Its range is local and the form of the tree is not of the\r\n    best. An occasional log reaches a sawmill, but the principal demand\r\n    is for fuel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIGTREE\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BIGTREE]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIGTREE\r\n\r\n(_Sequoia Washingtoniana_)\r\n\r\n\r\nBotanists have had a hard time giving this tree a Latin name which will\r\nmeet the requirements of technical classification, but an English name\r\nacceptable everywhere was early found for it--bigtree. No fewer than a\r\ndozen names have been proposed by botanists. Most of them attempt to\r\nexpress the idea of vastness or grandeur; but the simple English name\r\ncomes directly to the point and ends the controversy as far as the\r\ncommon name is concerned.\r\n\r\nEverything connected with this tree is interesting. Geologically, it is\r\nas old as the yellow poplar. There were five species of sequoias in the\r\nnorthern hemisphere, in Europe and America, before the ice age. They\r\ngrew in the North, nearly to the Arctic circle, at a time when the\r\nclimate of those regions was milder than it is now. The later advance of\r\nthe ice southward overwhelmed three species of bigtrees, and pushed two\r\nsurvivors into the region which is now California. These are the bigtree\r\nand the redwood. It is not known how long ago it was that the ice sheet\r\ndid its destructive work, but it antedated human history, and the\r\ngigantic trees have been in California since that time.\r\n\r\nLong after the ice age ceased generally in North America it continued\r\namong the high Sierras of California, and the bigtrees to this day give\r\na hint of it in the peculiar outlines of their range. They are scattered\r\nnorth and south along the face of the Sierra Nevada mountains in\r\nCalifornia, a distance of 260 miles, and at elevations from 4,500 to\r\n8,000 feet.\r\n\r\nThe aggregate of the total areas is about fifty square miles. The stand\r\nis not continuous, but consists of “groves,” that is, isolated stands\r\nwith wide intervals between, where no trees of this species are found.\r\nThe arrangement suggests that the bigtree forest was cut in sections by\r\nglaciers which descended from the high mountains to the plains, a\r\ndistance of one hundred miles or more, crossing the belt of sequoias at\r\nright angles. The glaciers withdrew thousands of years ago, and their\r\ntracks down the mountain slopes have long been covered by forests; but\r\nthe bigtree groves, for some unknown reason, never spread into the\r\nintervening spaces, but today are separated by wide tracts in which not\r\na seedling or an old trunk or log of that species is to be found. This\r\nis one of the mysteries which add interest to those wonderful trees--why\r\nthey cannot extend their range beyond the circumscribed limits which\r\nthey occupied thousands of years ago.\r\n\r\nIt was claimed for a long time and was quite generally believed that\r\nbigtrees were not reproducing, that there “were no little bigtrees.”\r\nThat was conclusively disproved by Fred G. Plummer, geographer of the\r\nUnited States Forest Service, who made a scientific study of a small\r\ngrove, measured the trees, and actually counted and classified them. His\r\nwork showed that there were in the area which he investigated:\r\n\r\n  Trees containing 100,000 to 120,000 feet each        2\r\n  Trees containing 80,000 to 100,000 feet each        13\r\n  Trees containing 60,000 to 80,000 feet each         49\r\n  Trees containing 40,000 to 60,000 feet each        112\r\n  Trees containing 20,000 to 40,000 feet each        251\r\n  Trees containing less than 20,000 feet each        353\r\n  “Little bigtrees”                                2,682\r\n                                                   -----\r\n                                            Total  3,462\r\n\r\nBigtree is distantly related to southern cypress, and the shapes of very\r\nold trees of both species bear some resemblance. Bigtree leaves do not\r\nfall annually as those of bald cypress do. They are from one-eighth to\r\none-fourth of an inch long, and on the leading shoots they may be half\r\nan inch in length. Cones are from two to three and a half inches long,\r\nand they ripen their seeds the second year, but the empty cones may\r\nadhere to the branches several years. The seeds are a quarter of an inch\r\nlong, and have wings sufficient to carry them a hundred yards or more.\r\nThe trees bear abundance of seeds, in proportion to the small number of\r\nbranches. Though shapely and well clothed with limbs when young, the\r\ncrown contracts with age, and consists of a few enormous, crooked limbs,\r\nalmost destitute of twigs and small branches. One of these trees may\r\nactually bear more twigs when the trunk is only a foot in diameter than\r\nwill be on the same trunk when it is fifteen or twenty feet in diameter.\r\nThe old tree trunks are often without limbs to a height of 100 or 150\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nThe Douglas squirrel is the bigtree’s greatest enemy. In proportion to\r\nsize, this little creature probably eats ten times as many tree seeds as\r\nthe most ravenous hog that roams the forest. One of the first things\r\nthat impresses a visitor in a grove of bigtrees is the rich brown of the\r\nbark of some of the trunks. All are not brown alike, or at all seasons.\r\nThe trees on which the seed harvest is ready are the brownest, thanks to\r\nthe sharp claws, the tireless energy, and keen appetite of the Douglas\r\nsquirrel. He goes up and down the trunks for three square meals a day\r\namong the clusters of cone-bearing branches two hundred or three hundred\r\nfeet above, and makes several extra trips for exercise; and at each\r\nscratch of his briery foot he kicks off scales of bark, until the whole\r\ntrunk is “scratched raw.” The detached scales of bark accumulate in a\r\nmound about the base of the tree, where they have been so accumulating\r\nfor centuries. It is fortunate that those old trees have bark from one\r\nto two feet thick. They can afford to be scratched for a month or two\r\neach year.\r\n\r\nThese are the heaviest trees in America, notwithstanding their wood is\r\nlight. It weighs less than northern white cedar. The largest bigtree\r\ntrunks weigh more than 2,000,000 pounds. In order to stand at all, they\r\nmust stand plumb. It is a provision of nature that the old trees are\r\nalmost branchless, otherwise the wind would force them out of plumb and\r\nthey would go down. It has been claimed that the overthrow of one of\r\nthese giants is always brought about by one of two causes. The\r\ndevelopment of larger limbs on one side than on another unbalances them;\r\nor the wash of gullies undermines the roots on one side, and draws the\r\ntree that way. It is currently believed that no bigtree ever dies from\r\nnatural causes.\r\n\r\nA good deal of pure fiction has been published regarding the size and\r\nage of the largest of these trees. They are old enough and large enough\r\nwithout drawing upon the imagination. The tree’s base is greatly\r\nenlarged, but tapers rapidly the first few feet. There is little doubt\r\nthat some of the trunks are over forty feet in diameter, one foot above\r\nground, but that is not a fair measurement. The point should be five or\r\nsix feet at least. Measured thus, about twenty-five feet inside the bark\r\nwould represent the largest. With the bark added, the diameter would be\r\nnearly thirty feet. Probably not one tree in fifty, taking them as they\r\noccur in the whole range and counting veterans only, is fifteen feet in\r\ndiameter five feet from the ground.\r\n\r\nThere is also some extravagant guessing as to height. Too many tourists\r\nmeasure with the unaided eye, or accept a guidebook’s figures. An\r\nauthentic height of 365 feet--the measurement of a fallen trunk--is\r\nprobably the greatest. Very few reach three hundred feet. Many\r\nunreliable figures have been published concerning the age of bigtrees.\r\nOne thing can be accepted without question; size is no proof of age, in\r\ncomparing one tree with another; neither is the number of annual rings\r\nin a block cut from the side of a tree a reliable factor to determine\r\nage. The only sure way to determine the age of one of these trees is by\r\ncounting all the rings from the pith to bark. Care should be taken not\r\nto count the same ring twice, as may be done when the wood is curly.\r\nJohn Muir counted 4,000 rings in a bigtree stump. It is believed that no\r\nhigher age is backed by the evidence of yearly rings. It was twenty-four\r\nfeet in diameter. The count of another of like size made it 2,200 years\r\nold; and of still another of the same size placed its age at 1,300\r\nyears. The Forest Service has made accurate measurement and record of\r\nevery ring of growth in a tree that was over twenty-four feet in\r\ndiameter, and it is shown that during certain periods of years the tree\r\ngrew three or four times as rapidly as during other periods.\r\n\r\nThe wood of bigtree is very light, soft, moderately strong, brittle,\r\nsummerwood thin and dark rendering the rings of annual growth easily\r\nseen; the medullary rays are thin, numerous, and very obscure. The wood\r\nis light to dark red, the thin sapwood nearly white; it works easily,\r\nsplits readily, and polishes well. It is very durable in contact with\r\nthe soil. Trunks lie in the woods long periods before decay seriously\r\nattacks them; but forest fires hollow them, and finally burn them up.\r\nEnormous depressions are found in the forest where logs once lay, but\r\nwhich disappeared long ago, judging by the size of trees which have\r\nsince grown in the depressions. The interior of some large trunks which\r\nhave been worked up on sawmills showed the scars of forest fires\r\ncenturies ago. The annual rings which covered one such scar showed that\r\nthe burning took place 1,700 years ago.\r\n\r\nNot much can be said for the commercial uses of bigtree. Many a species\r\nof insignificant size is much more useful. Considerable quantities have\r\nbeen cut by sawmills. The waste is great, heavy trunks crushing badly in\r\nfall. Logs are so large that many of them are split with gunpowder to\r\nfacilitate handling them. Some of the wood has been exported for lead\r\npencils; other has been used for fence posts, shingles, and grapevine\r\nstakes, while the soft bark has been worked into novelties.\r\n\r\n    MACNAB CYPRESS (_Cupressus macnabiana_) is a California tree of\r\n    limited range and little commercial value. It grows in Napa, Lake,\r\n    Mendocino, and Trinity counties; is often little more than a\r\n    branching shrub, but the largest specimens may be thirty feet high\r\n    and fifteen inches in diameter. The wood is light, soft, and usually\r\n    of slow growth. The medullary rays are numerous but thin, and the\r\n    bands of summerwood are distinct. The cones are generally less than\r\n    one inch long, and the seeds have narrow wings. The foliage is\r\n    grayish which is due to white glands in the leaves. Forest foliage\r\n    is fragrant. The tree is known as white cedar, Shasta cypress, and\r\n    California mountain cypress.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREDWOOD\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REDWOOD]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREDWOOD\r\n\r\n(_Sequoia Sempervirens_)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis tree’s color is responsible for its name. It is sometimes spoken of\r\nas coast redwood to distinguish it from bigtree which grows in the\r\ninterior of California. In European markets it is known as California\r\nredwood to distinguish it from other redwoods growing in distant parts\r\nof the world. Its botanical name, _Sequoia sempervirens_, means\r\nevergreen sequoia. The other species of sequoia is also evergreen. In\r\nreality, the coast redwood is less of an evergreen than the bigtree is,\r\nbecause the leaves of redwood turn brown two years before they fall, but\r\nthere are always plenty of green leaves on the branches. The leaves are\r\nfrom one-quarter to one-half inch in length.\r\n\r\nThe geographical range of redwood covers about 6,000 square miles, but\r\nthe commercial range is scarcely one-fifth as much. The redwood belt\r\nextends 500 miles along the Pacific coast from southern Oregon to\r\ncentral California. It varies from ten to thirty miles in width. It is\r\nstrictly a fog belt tree, and grows poorly outside the region of ocean\r\nfog, which seldom reaches an altitude more than 2,800 feet above sea\r\nlevel. Where fog is thick and frequent, and soil is moist and otherwise\r\nsuitable, redwood forests have grown in such luxuriance that no species\r\nin this country exceeds it. Stands running much over 100,000 feet per\r\nacre are frequent, and it is said 1,000,000 feet have been cut from a\r\nsingle acre.\r\n\r\nRedwood cones are one inch or less in length. They ripen in one season.\r\nSeeds are quite small, and are equipped with wings. The bark is thick,\r\nbut is much thinner than the bark of bigtrees, though it is in great\r\nridges like the bark of that species. The habits of the two species, as\r\nto form of crown, are similar. Young redwoods, particularly if they grow\r\nin the open, develop symmetrical and conical crowns which they retain\r\nuntil the trunks are a foot or more in diameter. Lower limbs die and\r\nfall off after that, and old trees have crowns so small that it would\r\nseem impossible that they could supply the wood-building material for\r\ntrunks so large. That the growth should be slow under such circumstances\r\nis to be expected. The ages of mature trees vary from 500 to 800 years,\r\nbut an extreme age of 1,373 years is on record. The average is,\r\ntherefore, considerably below that of bigtrees.\r\n\r\nRedwoods grow as tall as bigtrees, but do not equal them in diameter of\r\ntrunk, though trees twenty feet in diameter occur.\r\n\r\nA noticeable feature of the forests is that, in a given stand, nearly\r\nall trees are of the same height, irrespective of size of trunk. The\r\ncrowns go up to the light and when they reach the common level of\r\nothers, and secure a share of light, they show no disposition to go\r\nhigher. The doctrine which they silently put into practice is to live\r\nand let others live. That habit makes it possible for redwoods to grow\r\nin very dense stands, which they could not do if a few trees domineered\r\nover the others, and appropriated the light to themselves.\r\n\r\nWhen old age overtakes the giant redwoods, they exhibit the first\r\nsymptoms of weakened vitality by dying at the top. Most trees over five\r\nhundred years old are “stag-headed.” From that period they die slowly,\r\nbut usually survive two or three hundred years after the visible signs\r\nof approaching death strike them.\r\n\r\nRedwood has an advantage over nearly all other needle-leaf trees in that\r\nit propagates by both seeds and sprouts. Few softwoods send up sprouts\r\nfrom stumps or roots. Redwoods of large size are produced that way, and\r\nthe stumps of very old trees send up many vigorous shoots. Sometimes a\r\nring of large trees surrounds a depression in the ground where the\r\nparent tree grew, died, and decayed.\r\n\r\nSprouts are of course confined to the immediate proximity of the parent\r\ntree, but redwood seeds are scattered by the wind over vacant spaces.\r\nThis results in dense stands where other conditions are favorable, but\r\nthe species has never been able to establish itself far inland or high\r\non mountains.\r\n\r\nIn 1880 the Federal census made a rough estimate of the available\r\nredwood, and placed it at 25,825,000,000 feet. More than twenty years\r\nlater, with heavy cutting all the time, private estimates placed the\r\nremaining stand at over 50,000,000,000 feet. The second estimate was\r\nunquestionably nearer correct than the first. The stand of no important\r\ntimber tree in this country is more easily estimated than redwood. The\r\nforests are compact, the trees large, the trunks similar in form, and\r\nthe well-timbered area is comparatively small. Redwood has been called\r\nthe most important timber tree of the Pacific coast. The title probably\r\nconfers too much, though the tree’s importance is beyond question. The\r\nannual cut of Douglas fir is nearly ten times as large as of redwood,\r\nand the supply still in the forests is much greater than that of\r\nredwood. The cut of western yellow pine likewise exceeds the output of\r\nredwood, and the remaining supply is larger. The cut of western red\r\ncedar, including shingles, is about the same, and the remaining stand of\r\ncedar is very large. Western hemlock, too, exists in large quantity, and\r\nits importance as a source of timber supply may be equal to redwood.\r\n\r\nRedwood is frequently referred to as one of the lightest in this\r\ncountry. Its weight per cubic foot, oven-dry, is 26.2 pounds. On the\r\nsame basis, white pine is 24, southern white cedar 20.7, northern white\r\ncedar 19.7, and bigtree 18.2. There are woods in Florida lighter than\r\nany of these. Redwood is very soft, yet it dulls tools quickly. It is\r\nmoderately strong, a little below white pine; it is brittle, again\r\nranking below white pine; it splits and works easily and polishes well.\r\nFew, if any woods surpass this one in splitting properties. Boards\r\ntwelve feet long and a foot wide may be rived from selected logs, and\r\nthey present surfaces nearly as smooth as if cut with a saw. However,\r\ncurly and wavy redwood is not uncommon, and that, too, splits well, but\r\nthe surface is not smooth. The width of annual rings varies, usually\r\nwide in young timber and narrow in old. The bands of summerwood are\r\nnarrow and clearly defined. The surface of redwood lumber absorbs water\r\nquickly, yet, for some reason, creosote and other preservatives can be\r\nforced into the wood only with the greatest difficulty. Fortunately, it\r\nis not necessary to treat this timber to prevent decay, for, in almost\r\nany position, it wears out before it rots. Shingles, and window and door\r\nframes of the old barracks buildings at Eureka, California, remained in\r\nplace until fifty years of wind and driven sand wore them away.\r\nRailroads use the wood for ties until they wear out, not until they rot\r\nout. Farmers near some of the California railroads gather up the\r\nrejected worn ties by thousands and use them for fence posts. When\r\nredwood is employed as city paving blocks it is wear and not decay that\r\nputs them out of commission.\r\n\r\nThe medullary rays of redwood are thin and very obscure, but numerous.\r\nFew woods show them to less advantage in quarter-sawing. The lack of\r\nluster in the surface of polished panels is well known. The wood’s\r\nbeauty is in its sameness and richness of color. Except curly specimens\r\nand burls, the wood may be said to have no figure, though in planks cut\r\ntangentially, the contrast of spring and summerwood displays some figure\r\nin a modest way. It is possible to wash much of the coloring matter out\r\nof the wood, if it is first chipped fine. It washes from the surface by\r\nordinary exposure to weather. Red rainwater runs from a roof of new\r\nredwood shingles, and weatherboarding, posts, and picket fences fade\r\nperceptibly in a few months. This coloring matter when washed out in\r\nlarge amounts in the process of paper making has been manufactured into\r\nfuel gas.\r\n\r\nA complete list of the uses of redwood is not practicable, for this\r\nmaterial goes into most of the large wood-using factories of this\r\ncountry, and much is exported--nearly 60,000,000 feet annually going to\r\nforeign countries. It has been much employed in California cities and\r\ntowns for picket fences, and as posts for wire and plank fences. It is,\r\nnext to western red cedar, the most important shingle wood of the\r\nPacific coast. One western railroad alone had in its tracks 12,000,000\r\nredwood ties at one time. Builders of tanks, flumes, and water pipes\r\nprocure some of their best material, and large quantities of it, from\r\nredwood sawmills. Few woods are more universally found in furniture\r\nfactories.\r\n\r\n    GOWEN CYPRESS (_Cupressus goveniana_) follows the California coast\r\n    from Mendocino county, California, to San Diego, and ascends\r\n    mountains to the height of 3,000 feet in some localities. At its\r\n    best it is fifty feet high and two feet in diameter; but it extends\r\n    as a shrub over many sandy tracts. Specimens no more than a foot\r\n    high sometimes bear cones. The Gowen cypress sheds its leaves the\r\n    third and fourth years. Cones are from one-half to one inch long,\r\n    and each bears about 100 seeds. The wood is light, soft, weak, light\r\n    brown in color, the thick sapwood nearly white. The medullary rays\r\n    are numerous but obscure. The wood is used for posts and other ranch\r\n    purposes. Woodpeckers attack the trunks, picking holes through the\r\n    bark to suck the juice from the cambium layer beneath.\r\n\r\n    DWARF CYPRESS (_Cupressus pygmæa_) was formerly supposed to be a\r\n    stunted form of Gowen cypress. The ranges of both lie in the same\r\n    region, on the coast of California in Mendocino county. The average\r\n    height of dwarf cypress is from ten to twenty feet, with trunk\r\n    diameter from six to twelve inches; but in peat swamps and on\r\n    sterile sands it may not exceed three or four feet in height. It\r\n    bears abundant cones at that size, and sometimes a tree no more than\r\n    a foot high has mature cones. They ripen the second year, but remain\r\n    a long time on the branches. The trees thrive in the most forbidding\r\n    places, and are sometimes the only occupants of bogs or sand dunes.\r\n    The wood is necessarily of little value, because of the small size\r\n    of trees. There seems to be no record of a dwarf cypress over sixty\r\n    years of age; but it is believed that much older trees have fallen\r\n    victims to fire.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEMLOCK\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HEMLOCK]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEMLOCK\r\n\r\n(_Tsuga Canadensis_)\r\n\r\n\r\nSeven hemlocks are known in the world, four of them in America. Two of\r\nthese are in the East, two in the West. The eastern species are the\r\nCanadian and Carolinian. The former is _Tsuga canadensis_, the latter\r\n_Tsuga caroliniana_. The western species are, mountain hemlock (_Tsuga\r\nmertensiana_), and western hemlock (_Tsuga heterophylla_). The word\r\n_tsuga_ is Japanese and means hemlock.\r\n\r\nThe hemlock lumber in eastern markets is practically all from one\r\nspecies, which is known as hemlock in Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont,\r\nMassachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey,\r\nPennsylvania, Delaware, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina,\r\nKentucky, Wisconsin, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, Ontario. In Vermont,\r\nRhode Island, New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, West Virginia, North\r\nCarolina, South Carolina; in England it is called hemlock spruce; spruce\r\ntree in Pennsylvania and West Virginia; spruce pine in Pennsylvania,\r\nDelaware, Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia; to the New York Indians it\r\nwas known as oh-neh-tah, which being interpreted means “greens on the\r\nstick.”\r\n\r\nThe range of hemlock extends east and west more than fifteen hundred\r\nmiles, from Nova Scotia to western Wisconsin; south to Delaware and\r\nsouthern Michigan, and along the Appalachian mountains to northern\r\nAlabama and Georgia. The original quantity of timber was enormous, for\r\nlarge areas were covered with dense stands. The largest trees are found\r\nnear the southern part of its range, among the mountains of Tennessee\r\nand North Carolina; but the bulk of the timber has always been in the\r\nNorth. It thrives best in well drained soil, but it likes cool\r\nsituations and often develops dense forests on northern slopes or in\r\ndeep ravines; but it maintains a foothold on ridges, on the banks of\r\nstreams, and around the borders of swamps.\r\n\r\nThe cones are very small, about a half inch in length, growing singly\r\nfrom the lower side of the branchlet. Their scales are rounded and thin,\r\nlight brown in color. The seeds are winged and even when ripe the cones\r\ndo not spread apart perceptibly. The seeds escape, however, slowly\r\nduring the winter following their maturity. They are very small, and\r\ntheir wings distribute them a hundred feet or more. The seeds germinate\r\nbest on leaf mold, but the seedling takes several years to thrust its\r\nroots deep into the mineral soil. During that time, growth is very slow.\r\nA seedling five years old may not exceed five inches in height; but when\r\nits roots have developed, growth is fairly rapid. The distribution of\r\nseeds is often facilitated by the activities of red squirrels, and\r\nperhaps other small mammals, which climb the trees in winter and tear\r\nthe cones apart to get at the seeds. Many of the seeds are devoured, but\r\nmore escape and fly away on the winter winds.\r\n\r\nHemlock leaves are narrow and about half an inch long. Examined closely,\r\nparticularly with a magnifying glass, rows of white dots extend from end\r\nto end on the under side. Small as these white points are separately,\r\nwhen seen in the aggregate they change the color of the whole crown of\r\nthe tree. This is illustrated by looking at a hemlock from a\r\ndistance--the upper sides of the leaves on the drooping twigs being then\r\nvisible and the tree’s aspect dark green. Approach the tree, and look up\r\nfrom its base--the under side of the leaves being then visible--and the\r\ndark color changes to a light silvery tint. The whiteness is due to the\r\nwhite spots on the leaves. The spots are stomata (mouths), and are parts\r\nof the chemical laboratory which carries on the tree’s living processes.\r\nAll tree leaves have stomata, but all are not arranged in the same way\r\nand are not visible alike. Few trees have them as prominent as the\r\nhemlocks.\r\n\r\nHemlock attains a height from sixty to 100 feet and a diameter from two\r\nto four. When it grows in the open, it is one of the handsomest and most\r\nsymmetrical evergreens of any country. Its dark, dense foliage will\r\npermit scarcely any sunlight to filter through. When forest-grown, it\r\nloses its lower limbs. In the forester’s language, they are “shaded\r\noff,” and long, smooth trunks are developed; but the stubs from which\r\nthe branches fall remain buried deep inside the smoothest bole, and the\r\nsaws will find them when the logs are converted into lumber.\r\n\r\nReference has been made to hemlock’s slow growth during the seedling’s\r\nfirst four or five years. That takes place in the dense shade of the\r\nhemlock forest. If the seed falls on open ground, in full sunlight, the\r\nchance is that it will not germinate; but if it does, the seedling is\r\ndoomed to an early death. It cannot endure strong light. This fact is of\r\ngreat importance, for it means the end of hemlock forests. When a stand\r\nis cut and the sunshine reaches the ground, no seedlings bring on a new\r\nforest. White pine seeds grow in open ground, in old fields, in burnt\r\nwoods, wherever they reach soil, but hemlock must scatter its seeds in\r\ncool, deep shade or they will do little good. Strong, vigorous, and\r\nhealthy as hemlock trees are, they are killed more easily than almost\r\nany other. Cut a few trees from the center of a mature hemlock clump,\r\nand the chance is that several trees next to the open space thus made\r\nwill die. The unusual light proves too much for their roots which had\r\nalways been cool and damp; but when young hemlocks are protected until\r\nthey get a start, they thrive nicely in the open.\r\n\r\nThe wood of hemlock is light, soft, not strong, brittle, coarse and\r\ncrooked grained, difficult to work, liable to windshake, splinters\r\nbadly, not durable. The summerwood of the annual ring is conspicuous;\r\nand the thin medullary rays are numerous. The color of hemlock heartwood\r\nis light brown, tinged with red, often nearly white. The sapwood is\r\ndarker. Lumbermen recognize two varieties, red and white, but botanists\r\ndo not recognize them.\r\n\r\nThe physical characters of hemlock are nearly all unfavorable, yet it\r\nhas become a useful and widely used wood. It is largely manufactured\r\ninto coarse lumber and used for outside work--railway ties, joists,\r\nrafters, sheathing, plank walks, laths, etc. It is rarely used for\r\ninside finishing, owing to its brittle and splintery character. Clean\r\nboards made into panels or similar work and finished in the natural\r\ncolor often present a very handsome appearance, owing to the peculiar\r\npinkish tint of the wood, ripening and improving with age.\r\n\r\nWith the growing scarcity of white and Norway pine, hemlock has become\r\nthe natural substitute for these woods for many purposes. It has never\r\nbeen conceded that hemlock possesses the intrinsic merit of either of\r\nthe northern pines for structural purposes, but it has proven a suitable\r\nsubstitute for a variety of uses, notably for framing and sheathing of\r\nmedium priced structures.\r\n\r\nIn 1910 hemlock lumber was cut in twenty-one states, the total output\r\nexceeding 2,500,000,000 feet. Only four species or groups of species\r\nexceeded it in amount. They were southern yellow pines, Douglas fir, the\r\noaks, and white pine. The principal cut of hemlock lumber was in the\r\nfollowing states in the order named: Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania,\r\nWest Virginia, New York, Maine, Vermont, Virginia, New Hampshire,\r\nTennessee, and North Carolina. Ten other states produced smaller\r\namounts.\r\n\r\nHemlock possesses remarkable holding power on nails and spikes, and that\r\nis one reason for its large use for railroad ties. It does not easily\r\nsplit, and there is no likelihood that spikes will work loose; but the\r\nwood decays quickly in damp situations, and unless given preservative\r\ntreatment, hemlock ties do not last long. They are pretty soft anyway,\r\nand where traffic is heavy, rails cut them badly.\r\n\r\nManufacturers of boxes and crates use much hemlock. The annual use for\r\nthat purpose in Massachusetts is about 27,000,000 feet, in Michigan\r\npractically the same quantity, in Illinois 34,000,000, and varying\r\nquantities in many other states. Michigan converts nearly 100,000,000\r\nfeet a year into flooring and other planing mill products, and Wisconsin\r\nand other hemlock states follow it in lesser amounts. The wood is\r\nemployed by car builders, slack coopers, manufacturers of\r\nrefrigerators, silos, and farm implements; but the largest demand comes\r\nfrom those who use the rough lumber.\r\n\r\nHemlock bark is the most important tanning material in this country. It\r\nhas long been used by leather makers who generally mix it with some\r\nother bark or extract because leather tanned with hemlock alone has a\r\nredder color than is desired.\r\n\r\nLarge areas of hemlock forests have been cut for the bark alone.\r\nFormerly the wood was of so little value that it was cheaper to leave it\r\nin the forest than to take it out. The peelers worked in early summer,\r\ncutting trees and removing the bark in four-foot lengths, which was\r\nmeasured by the cord, though often sold by weight. Care was taken that\r\nthe bark be removed from the slashings before the dry weather of autumn,\r\nfor fire was to be expected then, and anything combustible in the woods\r\nat that time was likely to be lost. The tracts on which bark peelers\r\nworked were called “slashings,” and they were fire traps of the worst\r\nkind with their tangled masses of tops and branches.\r\n\r\nLarge quantities of hemlock bark are still peeled every summer, but the\r\npractice is less destructive than formerly. The trunks are worth taking\r\nout, and when the fire comes late in the season it consumes little\r\nvaluable hemlock. A permanent decline in the annual production of this\r\nwood has not yet begun, but it must soon set in, for the demand cannot\r\nbe indefinitely met.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWESTERN HEMLOCK\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WESTERN HEMLOCK]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWESTERN HEMLOCK\r\n\r\n(_Tsuga Heterophylla_)\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen this wood began to go to market, its promoters found difficulties\r\nin securing a trial for it in eastern states, because of its name. The\r\neastern hemlock was known to be a substantial wood, but a rough one with\r\nmany faults linked with its virtues. It was naturally supposed that the\r\nwestern hemlock had all the faults of its eastern relative with possibly\r\nsome of the good qualities left out; and there was general hesitancy to\r\nput the new comer to a trial. That caused a movement among western\r\nlumbermen to sell their hemlock under some other name. They were\r\nconfident the wood had only to be given a trial and it would win its\r\nway, after which the name would make little difference. Accordingly, it\r\nwas started to market under the name of Alaska pine, although Alaska has\r\nno pine large enough for good lumber. Other lumbermen thought it\r\nadvisable to choose a name less likely to excite suspicion, and they\r\ncalled it Washington pine. Others designated it as spruce, and still\r\nothers as fir. It was more likely to pass for fir than for pine or\r\nspruce.\r\n\r\nThe lumber is now generally known as western hemlock, but in California\r\nsome call it hemlock spruce or California hemlock spruce. In Idaho,\r\nWashington, and Oregon the name hemlock usually suffices; while western\r\nhemlock spruce, and western hemlock fir, and Prince Albert’s fir are\r\nnames used in speaking of lumber and of the tree in the forest.\r\n\r\nWestern hemlock’s range extends north and south a thousand miles, from\r\nsouthern Alaska to California south of San Francisco. It grows from the\r\nPacific coast eastward to Montana, five hundred miles or more. It\r\nascends to altitudes of 6,000 feet, but it is not at its best on high\r\nmountains, but in the warm, damp region near the coast in Washington and\r\nOregon. Trees 200 feet high and eight or ten in diameter are found, but\r\nthe average size is much less.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of western hemlock are dark green and very lustrous above.\r\nThe flowers are yellow and purple. Cones are one inch or less in length,\r\nand the small seeds are equipped with wings which carry them some\r\ndistance from the base of the parent tree. The seeds will germinate and\r\ndevelop a root system without touching mineral soil. Their ability to do\r\nso assists them greatly in maintaining the tree’s position in the damp\r\nclimate where this hemlock reaches its best development. The ground in\r\nthe forest, with all objects that lie upon it, is often covered with wet\r\nmoss a foot or more thick. The seeds of most trees would inevitably\r\nperish if they fell upon such a bed of moss; but the seeds of western\r\nhemlock germinate, and the rootlets strike through the moss until they\r\nreach the soil beneath, and seedling trees are soon growing vigorously.\r\nSeeds often germinate in the moss on logs and stumps, but the roots\r\nstrike for the ground, and generally reach it. In this habit the western\r\nhemlock resembles the yellow birch of the East whose seeds seem to\r\ngerminate best on mossy logs and stumps.\r\n\r\nWestern hemlock has one of the bad habits of its eastern relative: it\r\ndoes not prune itself very well, even in dense forests, and the lumber\r\nis apt to be knotty, but the knots are usually sound, though dark in\r\ncolor.\r\n\r\nThe wood of western hemlock is moderately light, but twenty per cent\r\nheavier than eastern hemlock; stronger than the wood of other American\r\nhemlocks, and nearly twenty-five per cent stronger than the eastern\r\ncommercial species, and nearly fifty per cent stiffer. It is tough and\r\nhard, but has little of the flinty texture of other hemlocks. Its color\r\nis pale brown, tinged with yellow, the thin sapwood nearly white. It is\r\nfairly durable in contact with the soil. Its growth is usually rapid,\r\nand trees live to a great age. Some of the largest are said to reach 800\r\nyears. The summerwood often constitutes half of the yearly ring, and is\r\ndark yellow. The medullary rays are numerous and rather prominent. When\r\ncut radially, the appearance, size, and arrangement of the exposed\r\nmedullary rays suggest those of sugar maple when exposed in the same\r\nway.\r\n\r\nThe annual sawmill output of western hemlock is about 170,000,000 feet.\r\nThe largest market for it is in the region where it grows, and it is\r\nused as rough lumber for ranch purposes and for buildings in towns; but\r\na considerable quantity is further manufactured. About one-fourth of the\r\nentire sawmill output goes to the factories of Idaho, Washington, and\r\nOregon. A list of the wood’s principal uses in those states shows its\r\nintrinsic value. The largest quantity is demanded by box factories. The\r\nwood’s nail-holding power commends it for that use, but of no less\r\nimportance is its strength. Eighty-three per cent of all the wood used\r\nfor boxes in Washington is western hemlock. Cooperage calls for much of\r\nthis wood also. Fruit and vegetable barrels are made of it. Its place in\r\nfurniture manufacture corresponds to that of the other hemlock in the\r\nEast. The pulp business is not very extensive on the Pacific coast, but\r\nwestern hemlock is a respectable contributor. It is suitable for burial\r\nboxes, and probably ranks about third among the woods within its range,\r\nthose used in larger amounts being Sitka spruce and western red cedar.\r\nIt is coming into use as interior finish, particularly as door and\r\nwindow frame material. Fixture manufacturers employ it for drawers and\r\nshelves. It is made into flooring, ceiling, molding, and wainscoting.\r\nDoor makers use a little of it as core material over which to glue\r\nveneers. It is made into veneer, but of the cheaper sorts, such as are\r\nsuitable for crates and berry boxes.\r\n\r\nThe Pacific coast is so abundantly supplied with excellent softwoods\r\nthat only those of good quality have any chance in the local markets.\r\nThe fact that western hemlock has won and is holding an important place\r\nin active competition with such woods as western red cedar, yellow\r\ncedar, Sitka spruce, and Douglas fir, is proof that it is valuable\r\nmaterial. It is winning its way in the central part of the United States\r\nalso, but not as rapidly as it has won in the West.\r\n\r\nThe bark of western hemlock is rated high as a tanning material. The\r\nbark on young trees is thin, but as the trunks increase in size and age\r\nthe bark thickens. It is richer in tannin than the bark of eastern\r\nhemlock, but is not so extensively used because the demand is less on\r\nthe Pacific coast.\r\n\r\nThe future of the western hemlock is fairly well assured. Its range is\r\nextensive and varied, and lumbermen will be a long time in cutting the\r\nlast of the present stand. Reproduction is satisfactory. It will be\r\nimportant in future forestry, when people will grow much of the timber\r\nthey need; but this tree will stick pretty close to the range where\r\nnature planted it.\r\n\r\nMOUNTAIN HEMLOCK (_Tsuga mertensiana_) is a near relative of western\r\nhemlock, and occupies the same geographical ranges but higher on the\r\nmountains. Near Sitka, Alaska, it occurs at sea level, but southward it\r\nrises higher until on the Sierra Nevada mountains in California it is\r\n10,000 feet above sea level. It is one of the timber line trees in many\r\nparts of its range, though it is nowhere above all others. It is a\r\ndifficult matter to state what its average size is. That depends upon\r\nthe particular region considered. At its best it is 100 feet high or\r\neven more; at its poorest it sprawls on the rocks like a shrub.\r\nSpecimens of fair size are from twenty-five to sixty feet high, and ten\r\nto twenty inches in diameter. Cones vary in size fully as much as the\r\ntrunks. Some are one-half inch in length, others are three inches. The\r\nleaves vary no less, some being a one-twelfth inch long, others one\r\ninch. The leaves stand out on all sides of the twig, and fall during the\r\nthird and fourth years. They are bluish-green. The seeds fall in\r\nSeptember and October, and are provided with large wings. The wood is\r\nlight in weight, soft, and pale reddish-brown. The mountain hemlock is\r\nnearly always spoken of as spruce by persons who are not botanists. The\r\narrangement of the leaves on the twigs gives the impression that it is a\r\nspruce, and among the names by which it is known in its native region\r\nare Williamson’s spruce, weeping spruce, alpine spruce, hemlock spruce,\r\nPatton’s spruce, and alpine western spruce. There is little prospect\r\nthat this tree will ever become important as a source of lumber. It is\r\nnowhere very abundant, and what timber there is generally stands so\r\nremote from mills that little of it will ever be taken out. Botanists\r\nand mountain travelers who have made the acquaintance of the mountain\r\nhemlock in the wildness of its natural surroundings have spoken and\r\nwritten much in its praise. It has been called the loveliest\r\ncone-bearing tree of the American forest. That praise, however, applies\r\nonly when the tree is at its best, with its broad, pyramidal crown,\r\nbalanced and proportioned with geometrical accuracy, outlined against a\r\nbackground of rocks, peaks, snow, or sky. Its other form, prostrate and\r\nangular where the tree occurs on cold, bleak mountains, has never\r\ninspired praise from anybody, though its defiance of the elements and\r\nits persistence in spite of adversity, cannot but challenge the\r\nadmiration of all who like a fair and square fighter. There are many\r\nintermediate forms. On mountains facing the Pacific, and at altitudes of\r\n6,000 or 7,000 feet, the young hemlocks are buried under deep snow weeks\r\nor months at a time. They are pressed down by the weight of tons, and it\r\nmight be supposed that not a whole branch would be left on them, and\r\nthat the main stems would be deformed the rest of their lives. But when\r\nthe early summer sun melts the snow, the young trees spring back to\r\ntheir former faultless forms, without a twig missing or a twisted\r\nbranch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWESTERN YEW\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WESTERN YEW]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWESTERN YEW\r\n\r\n(_Taxus Brevifolia_)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Pacific yew is an interesting tree, useful for many minor purposes,\r\nbut it is not procurable in large quantities. Its north and south range\r\ncovers more than 1,000 miles, from Alaska to central California; while\r\nthe species occurs from the Pacific coast eastward to Montana. It\r\napproaches sea level on some of the Alaskan islands, and toward the\r\nsouthern part of its range it reaches an altitude of 8,000 feet.\r\n\r\nIn Idaho it is called mountain mahogany, but apparently without good\r\nreason. Its color may bear some resemblance to that wood, but it is\r\ndifferent in so many particulars that the name is not appropriate. The\r\nnames western yew and Pacific yew are used interchangeably. Sometimes it\r\nbears the simple name yew; but since there is a yew in Florida, and\r\nanother in Europe, it is well to give the western species a name which\r\nwill distinguish it from others. The northwestern Indians called it\r\n“fighting wood,” which was the best description possible for them to\r\ngive. They made bows of it, and it was superior to any other wood within\r\ntheir reach for that purpose. In fact, if they could have picked from\r\nall the woods of the United States they could scarcely have found its\r\nequal. It is very strong, though in elasticity its rating is under many\r\nother woods. It is of interest to note that five hundred or more years\r\nago, the European yew (a closely related but different species) had\r\nnearly the same name in England that the northwestern Indians gave the\r\nwestern yew. It was called “the shooter yew,” because it was the bow\r\nwood of that time, and “bow staves,” which were rough pieces to be\r\nworked out by the bow makers, were articles of commerce. The search for\r\nit was so great, and so long-continued, that yew trees were well-nigh\r\nexterminated in the British Isles. It was, next to oak, and possibly\r\nabove oak, the most indispensable wood in England at that time. It is\r\ninstructive to observe that Indians who used the bow found the western\r\nyew as indispensable in their life as the English armies found the\r\nEuropean yew at a time when the bow was the best weapon.\r\n\r\nThe northwestern Indians put this remarkable wood to other uses. They\r\nmade spears of it, and sometimes employed them as weapons of war, but\r\ngenerally as implements of the chase, particularly in harpooning salmon\r\nwhich in summer ascend the northwestern rivers from the Pacific ocean in\r\nimmense schools. The Indians whittled fishhooks of yew before they were\r\nable to buy steel hooks from traders. Some of those unique hooks are\r\nstill in existence, and speak well of the inventive genius of the wild\r\nfisherman of the wilderness. A proper crook was selected where a branch\r\njoined the trunk, and serviceable fish hooks were made without any cross\r\ngrain. They were strong enough to hold the largest fish that ascended\r\nthe rivers. Sometimes a bone barb was skillfully inserted. The Indians\r\nfound a further use for this wood as material for canoe paddles. It is\r\nso strong that handles can be made small and blades thin without passing\r\nthe limit of safety. The manufacture of boat paddles from yew continues.\r\n\r\nMore is used for fence posts than for any other one purpose. It is one\r\nof the most durable woods known where it must resist conditions\r\nconducive to decay. The name yew is said to be derived from a word in a\r\nnorth Europe language meaning everlasting. Yew fence posts are not named\r\nin statistics, and it is impossible to quote numbers. Their use is\r\nconfined to the districts where they grow.\r\n\r\nThe manufacturers of small cabinets draw supplies from this wood, but\r\nthe fact is not mentioned in Pacific states wood-using statistics. It is\r\nparticularly liked for turnery, such as small spindles used in furniture\r\nand in grill work. It takes an exceptionally fine polish, and the wood’s\r\ngreat strength makes the use of slender pieces practicable. Experiments\r\nhave shown that this wood may be stained with success, but its natural\r\ncolor is so attractive that there is little need of staining unless the\r\npurpose is to imitate some more costly wood. If stained black it is an\r\nexcellent substitute for ebony.\r\n\r\nWestern yew figures little in lumber output. It is not listed in the\r\nmarkets. The few logs which reach sawmills are never again heard of, but\r\nprobably most of the lumber is disposed of locally to those who need it.\r\nThe tree is not of good form for saw timber. Burls are said to make\r\nbeautiful veneer. Trunks are seldom round, but usually grow lopsided.\r\nMost of them are too small for sawlogs. The largest are seldom two feet\r\nin diameter, and generally not half that large. They are short and\r\nbranched, the tree often dividing near the ground in several stems. The\r\naverage tree is scarcely thirty feet high, but a few are twice that. Its\r\ngrowth is very slow. A six-inch trunk is seventy-five or 100 years old,\r\nand the largest sizes are from 200 to 350 years. It is evident,\r\ntherefore, that efforts to grow western yew for commercial purposes will\r\nbe few. Wild trees will be occasionally cut as long as they last, and\r\nthey will probably last as long as any of their associates, for they are\r\nscattered sparingly over several hundred thousand square miles of\r\ncountry, and some of it rough and almost inaccessible. The best\r\ndevelopment of the species is in western Oregon, Washington, and British\r\nColumbia.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of western yew are one-half or five-eighths inch long. The\r\nfruit consists of red pulp enclosing a hard seed. Birds devour it\r\neagerly. The fruit is not poisonous, as the yew berries of the Old World\r\nare. It ripens in September and falls in October. The wood is fine\r\ngrained, clear rose red, becoming gradually duller on exposure. It\r\nweighs 39.83 pounds per cubic foot. Its fuel value is high.\r\n\r\nFLORIDA YEW (_Taxus floridana_) is extremely local in its range, and\r\nsmall in size. Few trees are more than twenty-five feet high and one\r\nfoot in diameter. They are bushy and of poor form for manufacturing. The\r\nonly reported use is as fence posts. The wood’s durability fits it for\r\nthat place. The species is found in Gadsden county, Florida. The leaves\r\nare one inch or less in length; flowers appear in March, and the fruit\r\nripens in October. The wood is moderately heavy, hard, and\r\nnarrow-ringed, for the trees grow slowly. Its color is dark, tinged with\r\nred, the thin sapwood being whiter. There is little prospect that the\r\nwood of this yew will ever be more important than it is now. It is often\r\nspoken of locally as savin, which name is likewise given to the red\r\ncedar (_Juniperus virginiana_), which is abundant in this yew’s range.\r\n\r\nCALIFORNIA NUTMEG (_Tumion californicum_) is an interesting tree which\r\nranges over a considerable portion of California, but is at its best in\r\nMendocino county and the coast region north of San Francisco. It occurs\r\nalso on the western slope of the Sierra Nevada mountains, in central\r\nCalifornia, at altitudes up to 5,000 feet. It receives its name from the\r\nresemblance of its seeds to nutmegs. Their surface is shriveled, but\r\nthey do not have the nutmeg odor. The wood and the leaves, when bruised,\r\ngive off an odor not altogether pleasing. On account of this, the tree\r\nhas been called stinking cedar. In some localities it is called yew, and\r\nin others California false nutmeg, and coast nutmeg. Trees are generally\r\nsmall, with trunks of irregular form. The crown is open and usually\r\nextends to the ground; but in crowded situations, a rather shapely bole\r\nis developed, and the crown is small. The usual size of the tree does\r\nnot exceed a height of fifty feet and a diameter of twenty inches. More\r\ntrees are below than above that size; but in extreme cases the tree may\r\nreach a height of eighty-five feet and a diameter of four. The leaves in\r\nform and size resemble the foliage of yew, but their points are stiff\r\nand sharp, and if approached carelessly they will wound like cactus\r\nthorns. The fruit is an inch or more in length, a pulpy substance\r\nsurrounding the seed. The wood possesses properties which ought to make\r\nit valuable, though reported uses are strictly local, such as small\r\ncabinet work and skiff making. It is bright lemon, yellow, rather hard,\r\ntakes good polish, is of slow growth, with bands of summerwood thin but\r\ndistinct, and medullary rays small, numerous, and obscure. Its weight is\r\n29.66 pounds per cubic foot; it is not stiff or strong. It cannot attain\r\nhigh place as a manufacturing material, because it is too scarce, but\r\nit possesses a beauty which must bring it recognition as a fine\r\nfurniture, finish, and novelty wood. A few sawlogs go to mills in the\r\nregion north of San Francisco, but the lumber is probably mixed with\r\nother kinds and it goes to market without a name. It ought to be put to\r\na better use.\r\n\r\nFLORIDA TORREYA (_Tumion taxifolium_) is often called Chattahoochee pine\r\nin the region where it grows. That name is generally given to the tree\r\nwhen planted for ornament in yards, parks, and along streets of towns in\r\nnorthwestern Florida. It is known also as stinking cedar, stinking\r\nsavin, and fetid yew. These names are generally applied to the\r\nforest-grown tree, particularly by those who cut it for fence posts,\r\nwhich is its principal use. Its range is local, being confined largely,\r\nif not wholly, to Gadsden county, Florida, where it grows on limestone\r\nsoil. It can never have much importance as a commercial timber, because\r\nit is too scarce. In fact, it is in danger of extermination. Post\r\ncutters never spare it, and its range being so limited, there is not\r\nmuch hope for it. The interesting and beautiful tree is making a game\r\nfight for life. Many seedlings appear in the vicinity of old trees,\r\nwhile stumps, and even prostrate trunks, send up sprouts which, if let\r\nalone, grow to tree size. Sprouts on logs and stumps send roots to the\r\nground as the seedling yellow birch does in damp northern woods. The\r\nyew-like leaves of Florida torreya are one and a half inch or less in\r\nlength. The tree blooms in March and April, and the drupe-like fruit, an\r\ninch or more in length, is ripe by midsummer. The tree is from forty to\r\nsixty feet in height, and one to two feet in diameter. It is clothed in\r\nwhorls of limbs, beginning near the ground, and tapering to the top. The\r\nwood is clear, bright yellow, the thin sapwood of lighter color; soft,\r\neasily worked, and susceptible of fine polish. It is very durable in\r\ncontact with the soil. The green wood, and the bruised leaves and\r\nbranches give off an odor suggesting the tomato vine. The texture and\r\ncolor of the wood indicate that it is well suited for fine cabinet work,\r\nbut it is not a figured wood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHITE OAK\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHITE OAK]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHITE OAK\r\n\r\n(_Quercus Alba_)\r\n\r\n\r\nOaks belong to the beech family, that is, the “foodtrees,”[3] though\r\nmost acorns are too bitter and contain too much tannin to be edible;\r\nsome may be eaten, and for that reason the ancients classed them among\r\nthe food trees. “Quercus,” which is the name of the genus, means oak in\r\nthe language of northwestern Europe. The name white oak nearly always\r\nsuffices, but in Arkansas it is often called stave oak because it is the\r\nbest stave timber in that region. It could with equal reason be called\r\nstave oak nearly anywhere, for it is excellent material for tight\r\ncooperage. Formerly it was sometimes called Baltimore oak, because many\r\nof the staves of export were shipped from that city. That name, however,\r\nbelonged more to post oak (_Quercus minor_) than to white oak, because\r\nthe fine staves which went out of Chesapeake bay in the export trade,\r\nwere largely post oak. It matters little now, for the name Baltimore oak\r\nis not much used, and white oak may be said to have only one trade name.\r\nAfter the wood is dressed, it has different names referring to the style\r\nof finish and not to the wood itself.\r\n\r\n    [3] The oaks of this country, which number more than fifty species,\r\n    have been classified in different ways, depending upon the purpose\r\n    in view. In the present treatment they will be divided in two\r\n    general groups, white oaks and black oaks. No effort will be made to\r\n    draw hard and fast lines, because it is not necessary. Oaks which\r\n    ripen their acorns in one year are listed as white oaks; those with\r\n    two year acorns, as black oaks. This is a botanical rather than a\r\n    lumberman’s classification; yet lumbermen recognize it in a general\r\n    way. White oak (_Quercus alba_) is clearly entitled to head the list\r\n    of white oaks, and red oak (_Quercus rubra_) should occupy a similar\r\n    position with regard to the black oak group. In numbers, the white\r\n    oaks and black oaks are nearly equally divided, one authority giving\r\n    twenty-seven species of white oak and twenty-five of black oak in\r\n    the United States; but botanists differ as to exact numbers of each.\r\n    The following species are usually classed as white oaks: White oak\r\n    (_Quercus alba_), valley oak (_Quercus lobata_), Brewer oak\r\n    (_Quercus breweri_), Sadler oak (_Quercus sadleri_), Pacific post\r\n    oak (_Quercus garryana_), Gambel oak (_Quercus gambelii_), post oak\r\n    (_Quercus minor_), Chapman oak (_Quercus chapmani_), bur oak\r\n    (_Quercus macrocarpa_), overcup oak (_Quercus lyrata_), swamp white\r\n    oak (_Quercus platanoides_), cow oak (_Quercus michauxii_), chestnut\r\n    oak (_Quercus prinus_), chinquapin oak (_Quercus acuminata_), dwarf\r\n    chinquapin oak (_Quercus prinoides_), Durand oak (_Quercus\r\n    breviloba_), Rocky Mountain oak (_Quercus undulata_), California\r\n    blue oak (_Quercus douglasii_), Engelmann oak (_Quercus\r\n    engelmanni_), Rocky Mountain blue oak (_Quercus oblongifolia_),\r\n    Arizona white oak (_Quercus arizonica_), Toumey oak (_Quercus\r\n    toumeyi_), netleaf oak (_Quercus reticulata_), California scrub oak\r\n    (_Quercus dumosa_), live oak (_Quercus virginiana_), Emory oak\r\n    (_Quercus emoryi_).\r\n\r\nWhite oak grows in all the states east of the Mississippi river, and it\r\ncrosses that stream two or three hundred miles in some places. It\r\nreaches eastern Nebraska and eastern Kansas, and runs southward through\r\nOklahoma to the Brazos river, Texas. It is scarce in the northern parts\r\nof Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota. Its total range covers an area of\r\nmore than 1,000,000 square miles. Like all other important timber trees,\r\nit has regions where the species is best developed. The finest original\r\nstands of white oak were found in the upper Ohio valley, beginning in\r\nIndiana. The timber in many other districts was, and in some still is,\r\nvery good, such as southern Michigan, eastern Arkansas, some of the\r\nAppalachian valleys and slopes, and in certain places along the upper\r\ntributaries of streams flowing into the Atlantic ocean.\r\n\r\nThis tree is in the very front rank in economic importance, and it has\r\nheld that place since the earliest settlements in this country. No\r\nforest tree was more evenly distributed than white oak over the eastern\r\nhalf of the United States. It did not form pure forests of large extent,\r\nas some of the pines did, but white oaks were within reach of almost\r\nevery part of the country. Conditions have greatly changed. The\r\nestablishment of farms where woods originally occupied the whole\r\ncountry, lessened the abundance of oak long before lumbermen made it a\r\ncommodity; and since then, the cutting of billions of feet of it has\r\ndepleted or exhausted the supply in many regions. Still, white oak is as\r\nwidely dispersed as ever. It has not been completely exterminated in any\r\nextensive region. White oak of as high grade goes to market now as ever\r\nin the past, but in smaller amounts, and the lower grades go in\r\nproportionately larger quantities. In other words, prime white oak has\r\npassed its best day. A hundred years of use and abuse in states west of\r\nthe Alleghany mountains, and two hundred years in some of the regions\r\neast, have reduced original forests to remnants. But with all that,\r\nwhite oak remains undisputed king of American hardwoods.\r\n\r\nAt its best, white oak attains a height of 125 feet and a diameter of\r\nsix, but that size is unusual. A diameter of three feet and a height of\r\n100 is above the average. The leaves are peculiar in that they hang on\r\nthe branches until late winter, sometimes dropping only in time to give\r\nplace to the new crop. They turn brown after the first hard frost. In\r\nsome sections of the Appalachian region white oak coppice (sprout\r\ngrowth) is known as “red brush,” because of the adherence of the brown\r\nleaves during winter. The leaves of some other species have the same\r\nhabit.\r\n\r\nThe wood of white oak is very strong, stiff, heavy, and durable when\r\nexposed in all kinds of weather. Scarcely any other wood which can be\r\nhad in merchantable quantities equals white oak in these qualities. It\r\nrates high in fuel value, and 6,000 pounds of dry wood when burned,\r\nleaves about 245 pounds of ashes. The color of the heartwood is light\r\nbrown; the sapwood is thin; medullary rays are numerous and large; pores\r\nlarge; summerwood broad and dense.\r\n\r\nThe medullary rays of no wood in this or any other country are more\r\nutilized to commercial advantage than those of white oak. Quarter-sawing\r\nis for the purpose of bringing them out. They are the bright streaks,\r\nclearly visible to the naked eye in the end of an oak log, radiating\r\nfrom the center outward like the spokes of a wheel. Many are too thin to\r\nbe visible without a magnifying glass. By quarter-sawing, the rays are\r\ncut edgewise and appear as bright streaks or patches, often called\r\n“mirrors,” on the surface of boards. The woodworker knows how to finish\r\nthe boards and treat them with fillers to bring out the figures.\r\n\r\nWhite oak is a porous wood. Some of the pores are large enough to be\r\nvisible without a glass, and twenty times as many more can be seen only\r\nwhen magnified. The direction of the pores is up and down the trunk of\r\nthe tree, and they are seen to best advantage in the end of a stick,\r\nalthough they are always more or less visible on the side of a board\r\nwhen the cutting is a little across the grain. The pores thus cut\r\ndiagonally across are taken advantage of by the finisher who works\r\nstains and fillers into them, and changes their natural color, thereby\r\naccentuating the wood’s figure.\r\n\r\nThe possibilities of white oak are almost infinite. It is good for\r\nnearly anything for which any wood is used. It is not the best for\r\neverything, but does well for most. Hickory is more resilient, ironwood\r\nis stronger, locust more durable, white pine warps and checks less; but\r\nwhite oak has so many good qualities in a fair degree that it can afford\r\nto fall below the highest in some, and still rank above competitors on\r\ngeneral averages. It ranks high in shipbuilding, general construction,\r\nfurniture manufacturing, finish and fixtures, the making of agricultural\r\nimplements, car building, vehicle stock, cooperage, and many more.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the most important of American veneer woods. It is sawed\r\nvery thin, and is glued upon cores of other wood, thus becoming the\r\ncovering or outside part. The purpose of using oak veneer instead of the\r\nsolid wood is twofold. First, it goes farther, and second, a well-built\r\narticle with veneer outside and a core of other woods which stand well,\r\nis superior to a solid oak article, except in cases where great strength\r\nis the object sought, or where deep carving is desired.\r\n\r\nThe continued use of white oak is assured. It is not necessary to seek\r\nnew uses for it. The demand is as great as the supply can meet, but the\r\nsupply is not assured for the distant future. There will always be some\r\nwhite oak in the country; but the best has been or is being cut. The\r\ntree grows slowly, and good quarter-sawed white oak cannot be cut from\r\nyoung trees. An age of about 150 years is necessary. Most good white oak\r\nlumber today is cut from trees 200 or more years old. When the present\r\nsupply of venerable oaks has been exhausted, prime oak lumber will be\r\nlargely a thing of the past. Fortunately, that time has not yet arrived.\r\nAbout eighty years are required to grow a white oak of crosstie size.\r\nThose who will grow oak for market in the future will probably not wait\r\nmuch longer than eighty years to cut their trees, and the result will be\r\na scarcity of mature trunks for lumber and veneer.\r\n\r\n    DURAND OAK (_Quercus breviloba_). In some parts of Alabama,\r\n    Mississippi, and Louisiana this tree goes to the lumber yard as\r\n    white oak, and no one is injured by the substitution, for it is\r\n    heavy, hard, and strong, and is of good color. The wood weighs 59.25\r\n    pounds per cubic foot, which places it above the average weight of\r\n    white oak. It is said to be less tough than white oak. The tree\r\n    varies greatly in different parts of its range which extends from\r\n    central Alabama across Texas and into Mexico. It is known as white\r\n    oak, Texas white oak, shin oak, pin oak, and basket oak. Its best\r\n    development is in the eastern part of its range where trees eighty\r\n    or ninety feet high are common; but in Texas the average is scarcely\r\n    thirty feet high and one in diameter. Westward in Texas it becomes\r\n    shrubby, and forms extensive thickets of brush.\r\n\r\n    CHAPMAN OAK (_Quercus chapmani_) is put to little use, because\r\n    trunks are too small. They are seldom more than a foot in diameter,\r\n    and are often little more than shrubs. The tree grows in the pine\r\n    barrens near the coast from South Carolina to Florida, and it is\r\n    found also in great abundance, but generally of small size, on the\r\n    west coast of Florida from Tampa to the Apalachicola river.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBUR OAK\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BUR OAK]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBUR OAK\r\n\r\n(_Quercus Macrocarpa_)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis splendid oak was named by Michaux, a French traveler and botanist\r\nwho visited many parts of eastern and southeastern United States more\r\nthan a century ago. The botanical name _macrocarpa_, means “large\r\nfruit.” The bur oak bears small acorns in the North, and very large ones\r\nin the South. They are sometimes two inches long and one and a half\r\ninches wide, and “large-fruit” oak is an appropriate name for the tree\r\nin the South, but would not be near the northern limit of its range.\r\n\r\nIt is known in different regions as bur oak, mossy cup oak, overcup oak,\r\nscrub oak, and mossy cup white oak. Bur oak is a name suggested by the\r\nacorn which has a fringe round the cup like a bur. This is the oak which\r\ngave name to James Fenimore Cooper’s book, “Oak Openings” a romance of\r\nearly days in Michigan. Oak openings were areas where fires had killed\r\nthe old timber, and a young growth had sprouted from stumps and roots,\r\nor had sprung up from seeds buried in the ground beyond the reach of the\r\nfire. Some of those tracts were very large, and they were not confined\r\nto any one state. They existed in Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota,\r\nDakota, and elsewhere. Bur oak, because it is a vigorous species, was\r\nable to take possession of such burned areas, to the exclusion of most\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nFew American oaks have a wider range. It extends from Nova Scotia to\r\nManitoba, and in the United States is found in most states east of the\r\nRocky Mountains. It extends farther west and northwest than any other\r\ncommercial oak of the Atlantic states. In a range of so great\r\ngeographical extent the bur oak finds it necessary to adapt itself to\r\nmany kinds of land. It prefers low tracts where water is sufficient but\r\nnot excessive, but it grows well in more elevated situations, provided\r\nthe soil is fertile. It is not a poor-land tree. In the primeval forests\r\nit attained largest size in Indiana and Illinois. The largest trees were\r\nfrom 150 to 170 feet high and four to seven in diameter. Sizes varied\r\nfrom that extreme down to the other extreme near the outskirts of its\r\nrange where the growth was stunted. Large quantities of very fine logs\r\nhave been cut from trunks from two to four feet in diameter, and forty\r\nto sixty feet to the limbs.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of bur oak are from six to twelve inches long, simple and\r\nalternate; the petioles are thick with flattened and enlarged bases; the\r\nleaves are wedge-shaped at the base, and have from five to seven long,\r\nirregular lobes, the terminal one very large and broad. They are dark\r\ngreen in color, and are smooth and shiny above, silvery white and\r\npubescent below. The edge of the leaf is notched somewhat like chestnut,\r\nbut the teeth or notches are not so sharp.\r\n\r\nThe twigs are provided with corky wings, or flattened keels of bark,\r\nalong their sides. Some of the wings are an inch or more wide. They are\r\napt to escape notice when the tree is in leaf, but in the winter the\r\nbare twigs look rough and ragged.\r\n\r\nThe weight of bur oak is approximately the same as white oak, and the\r\ntwo woods are much the same in strength and elasticity. The bands of\r\nsummerwood are broad and dense, and the springwood is filled with large\r\npores. The medullary rays are broad, but not numerous in comparison with\r\nwhite oak. They are sufficiently conspicuous to show well in\r\nquarter-sawing.\r\n\r\nBur oak nearly always goes to market as white oak, or simply as oak, and\r\nit is difficult to ascertain all the uses found for it. Some factories\r\nwhich make furniture, finish, vehicles, and other articles that figure\r\nin the country’s trade, attempt to identify the woods they use. That is\r\ndone as carefully in Michigan as anywhere else, though comparatively few\r\nof the factories carry out the plan even in that state where many of the\r\nbest wood-using establishments of the country are located. In a report\r\nissued in 1912 which gave statistics collected from more than eight\r\nhundred Michigan factories, bur oak received separate consideration. The\r\nuses there are doubtless representative, and will hold throughout the\r\ncountry wherever bur oak is fairly abundant. It is listed as baseboards,\r\nbilliard table rims, bookcases, clay working machines, filing cabinets,\r\nfurniture, hand sleds, hay balers, interior finish, molding, tinplate\r\nboxes, wagon sills, work benches. The amount of wood used in the state\r\nwas nearly 900,000 feet, according to the reports; but it certainly does\r\nnot include all. What it does show, however, is that bur oak is one of\r\nthe substantial woods of that region, and that it possesses properties\r\nwhich fit it for many important places in the country’s industries.\r\n\r\nBur oak contributes to the output of cooper shops. Slack coopers class\r\nit with many other hardwoods for the manufacture of barrels for\r\nvegetables and various other commodities, while the makers of barrels\r\nfor liquids put bur oak in with white oak.\r\n\r\nThe future of bur oak does not promise much after the trees which now\r\nremain have been cut. That does not mean that the species will become\r\nextinct, for that is improbable; but when the mature trees which\r\ndeveloped during two or three hundred years of forest conditions have\r\npassed away, there is not much prospect of others being left to grow to\r\nthe age and size which will make them valuable as lumber. Woodlot\r\nowners will not wait much longer than the seventy-five or one hundred\r\nyears required to grow trees of crosstie size. Railroads pay good prices\r\nfor this wood, for it lasts well, holds spikes in a satisfactory manner,\r\nand is strong and hard. As far as can be seen, bur oak will fare in the\r\nfuture about like white oak; that is, few trees will be left standing\r\nlong enough to attain large size, because it will pay better to cut them\r\nwhile comparatively small.\r\n\r\n    CALIFORNIA BLUE OAK (_Quercus douglasii_) receives its name from the\r\n    color of its foliage in spring and early summer in the valleys and\r\n    on the rolling foothills of central California. Later in the summer,\r\n    when the dry season is on, the leaves lose some of their blue, on\r\n    account of age, but more from an accumulation of dust; but even then\r\n    the form of the tree, from its habit of growing in open formation\r\n    like an old apple orchard, presents an attractive picture. It is\r\n    often associated with the valley oak, which is larger and more\r\n    stately, but the blue oak loses nothing by the contrast. It is\r\n    occasionally called rock oak, but for what reason is not clear. It\r\n    is known, too, as mountain white oak, or simply white oak, and as\r\n    blue oak. Its range covers central California from Mendocino to the\r\n    Mojave desert, and from the immediate coast inland through the\r\n    valleys to the Sierras, and upward to an altitude of 4,000 feet\r\n    where the tree degenerates into a shrub which has neither beauty nor\r\n    utility. The species reaches its best development in the Salinas\r\n    valley from twenty to sixty miles from the coast. There the largest\r\n    trees are found, and also some that have assumed peculiar forms. In\r\n    positions exposed to the never-ceasing sea winds which sweep up the\r\n    valleys, the blue oaks lie prone like logs, their tops pointing away\r\n    from the wind. They grew in that unnatural position, having been\r\n    pressed flat by the wind since they were seedlings. This oak’s ashen\r\n    gray bark harmonizes well with the dry summer grass and dull sand\r\n    and gravel which surround it during the hot period. The branches are\r\n    often covered with green-gray lichens which somewhat modify the\r\n    aspect of the tree under close inspection. The leaves are irregular\r\n    in form. Some closely resemble leaves of the eastern white oak,\r\n    while others are almost or quite without lobes. During the growing\r\n    season the acorns are deep green, but when approaching maturity they\r\n    change to a chestnut-brown. They vary in shape as much as the\r\n    leaves. Some are almost eggshaped, bulging out above the cup which\r\n    seems too small; but all of them do not assume that form, but may be\r\n    short and symmetrical, or very long and slender. Woodpeckers store\r\n    these acorns in large numbers, and they search out peculiar places\r\n    for their hoards. A knot hole in the weatherboarding of an old barn,\r\n    granary, or school house is considered ideal, though when the acorns\r\n    are so disposed of, they are out of reach of the woodpecker forever.\r\n    Another method is to peck holes just large enough for an acorn in\r\n    fence posts or dead tree trunks, and hammer the acorns tightly in,\r\n    small end first. The surfaces of dead trees are sometimes absolutely\r\n    covered with such holes, each with its acorn. The woodpecker’s\r\n    purpose is to wait until the acorns become infested with larvæ. He\r\n    has no intention of eating the acorn itself.\r\n\r\n    California blue oaks range in height from shrubs to trees of ninety\r\n    feet, with diameters of three or four feet. The average height is\r\n    about forty-five and the diameter two or less. The trunk frequently\r\n    divides a few feet from the ground into large limbs. That form\r\n    excludes the wood from sawmills, and only in rare cases does any of\r\n    it find its way there. The lumber is of poor quality, brittle,\r\n    black, and otherwise defective. The sapwood is white and thick. A\r\n    cubic foot weighs 55.64 pounds, or nearly ten more than eastern\r\n    white oak. It is weak, and is low in elasticity. The annual rings\r\n    are often nearly invisible, because the pores are scattered evenly\r\n    and do not form bands. The medullary rays are broad, in the heart\r\n    black, in the sapwood white. If the wood were otherwise suitable,\r\n    pleasing effects might be produced by quarter-sawing, but as far as\r\n    known, no attempts have been made to do this. Now and then a\r\n    suitable log might be found. The importance of this oak lies in its\r\n    fuel value. It rates above white oak in theoretical tests, but it is\r\n    heavier in ash, and in practice it hardly measures up to white oak.\r\n    It grows slowly and is destined to disappear as a source of fuel\r\n    supply. Reproduction has nearly ceased in most parts of its range,\r\n    due largely to the perseverance of hogs in eating the acorns.\r\n    Cordwood cutters have stripped the last tree from large areas where\r\n    much once grew. This oak never forms forests. The trees seldom grow\r\n    as close together as apple trees in an orchard.\r\n\r\n    GAMBEL OAK (_Quercus gambelii_) was destined by nature to occupy an\r\n    inferior place in the country’s timber resources. It occupies a\r\n    region of stunted vegetation among the dry mountains and plateaus of\r\n    the Southwest, and except where it grows in better situations than\r\n    usual, it is too small to be properly called a tree. It is at its\r\n    best among the mountains of southeastern Arizona where it grows in\r\n    canyons that can maintain a little damp soil. There it occasionally\r\n    reaches a height of thirty feet and a diameter of a foot or less. In\r\n    most other parts of its range it is simply a tangled, sprawling\r\n    thicket of brush, covering the dry, rocky mountain ridges, and along\r\n    the bases of cliffs. It is found from Colorado to western Texas, and\r\n    westward into Utah, Nevada, and Arizona. The leaves are small,\r\n    thick, firm, and hairy, typical of desert foliage which must husband\r\n    the scant water supply. The acorns are pretty large for a tree so\r\n    stunted, and they are tempting bait for birds and rodents of the\r\n    region. The acorns are sweet. If this oak’s reproduction depended on\r\n    acorns alone it is doubtful if it would hold its ground in the face\r\n    of perpetual adversity; but its roots send up distorted and stunted\r\n    sprouts which cover the ground, affording hiding places for the few\r\n    acorns which escape their hungry enemies. Man puts this oak to few\r\n    uses. It affords a pretty good class of fuel for camp fires, but\r\n    cordwood cutters cannot make much out of it. In rare instances\r\n    frontier ranches use a few of the unshapely poles for corral fences,\r\n    but only as a case of last resort. The names bestowed upon the tree\r\n    by those who know it best are uncomplimentary. They call it shin\r\n    oak, pin oak, scrub oak, mountain oak, and Rocky Mountain oak.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORKED-LEAF WHITE OAK\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FORKED-LEAF WHITE OAK]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORKED-LEAF WHITE OAK\r\n\r\n(_Quercus Lyrata_)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe leaf gives this tree its name in the best part of its southern\r\nrange. The tree bears much resemblance to the bur oak on the one hand,\r\nand swamp white oak on the other. The names by which it is known in\r\ndifferent regions indicate as much.\r\n\r\nIn North and South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi,\r\nLouisiana, Texas, Arkansas, and Illinois it is commonly known as\r\novercup; in Alabama, South Carolina, Mississippi, Louisiana, and\r\nMissouri it is called the swamp post oak; the name water white oak is\r\napplied to it in Mississippi and parts of South Carolina; swamp white\r\noak in Texas; forked-leaf white oak among lumbermen in several of the\r\nsouthern states. The last name scarcely describes the leaf, for no one\r\nis apt to notice any fork, unless his attention is called to it. The\r\nfact is, the name forked-leaf oak is applied oftener to the turkey oak\r\n(_Quercus catesbæi_) than to this one. However, since the ranges of the\r\ntwo species are not the same, misunderstandings in practice are not apt\r\nto arise as to which is meant when the forked leaf is referred to. The\r\nfact that turkey oak belongs in the black oak group, ripening its acorns\r\nin two years, and this one is a white oak with one year acorns, is of\r\nfurther assistance in keeping the species separate.\r\n\r\nThe range of the forked-leaf white oak is from Maryland, along the\r\nPotomac river near the District of Columbia, southward to parts of\r\nFlorida; westward through the Gulf states to the Trinity river in Texas;\r\nthroughout Arkansas, sections of Missouri, central Tennessee, southern\r\nIllinois and Indiana.\r\n\r\nIt shows preference for river swamps, and small deep depressions in rich\r\nbottom lands where moisture is always abundant. It has never amounted to\r\nmuch in the Atlantic states, and its best development is found in the\r\nmoist, fertile valley of Red river in Louisiana, and in certain parts of\r\nArkansas and Texas. Its geographical range is pretty large, but as a\r\ntimber tree it is confined to a comparatively restricted region west of\r\nthe Mississippi. Good trees are found in other parts of its range.\r\nLumbermen do not find it in extensive forests or pure stands, but\r\nisolated trees or small groups occur with other hardwoods.\r\n\r\nThis species of oak grows occasionally to a height of 100 feet, though\r\nits average is about seventy feet. It has a trunk two to three feet in\r\ndiameter, which spreads out after attaining a height of fifteen or\r\ntwenty feet, into small, often pendulous branches, forming a symmetrical\r\nround top. The branchlets are green, slightly tinged with red; covered\r\nwith short hairs when first appearing, becoming grayish and shiny during\r\ntheir first winter, eventually turning ashen gray or brown.\r\n\r\nThe bark is three-quarters or one inch thick, light gray in color,\r\nshedding in thick plates, its surface being divided into thin scales.\r\nThe winter buds are about one-eighth of an inch long and have light\r\ncolored scales. The staminate flowers grow in long, slender, hairy\r\nspikes from four to six inches long; the calyx is light yellow and\r\nhairy. The pistillate flowers are stalked and are also covered with\r\nhairs.\r\n\r\nThe fruit of forked-leaf white oak is often on slender, fuzzy stems,\r\nsometimes an inch or more in length, but is often closely attached to\r\nthe twig that bears it; the acorn is about one inch long, broad at the\r\nbase, light brown and covered with short, light hairs, and usually\r\nalmost entirely enclosed in the deep, spherical cup, which is bright\r\nreddish-brown on its inside surface, and covered on the outside with\r\nscales; thickened at the base, becoming thinner and forming an irregular\r\nedge at the margin of the cup. The cup often almost completely envelopes\r\nthe acorn. The fruit then looks somewhat like a rough, nearly spherical\r\nbutton.\r\n\r\nThis oak’s leaves are long and slender, and are divided in from five to\r\nnine lobes. When the leaves unfold they are brownish green and hairy\r\nabove and below; at maturity they are thin and firm, darker green and\r\nshiny on the upper surface, silvery or light green and hairy below; from\r\nseven to eight inches long, one to four inches broad; in autumn turning\r\na beautiful bright scarlet or vivid orange.\r\n\r\nCommercially this wood is a white oak, and it is seldom or never sent to\r\nmarket under its own name. There are no statistics of cut at the mills\r\nor of stand in the forests. Lumbermen take the tree when they come to it\r\nin the course of their usual operations, but never go out of their way\r\nto get it. Though rather large stands occur in certain southern regions,\r\nand scattering trees are found in large areas, the total quantity in the\r\ncountry is known to be too small to give this tree an important place as\r\na source of lumber. Neither is there expectation that the future has\r\nanything in store for this particular member of the tribe of oaks. The\r\nwood rates high in physical properties; is strong as white oak, if not\r\nstronger, tough, stiff, hard, and heavy. In contact with the ground it\r\nis very durable. The heartwood is rich, dark brown, the sapwood lighter.\r\n\r\nIt may be said, generally, that since it goes to market as white oak,\r\nand its buyers never object, it possesses the essential properties of\r\nthat wood, and is used in the same way as far as it is used at all.\r\n\r\nARIZONA WHITE OAK (_Quercus arizonica_) is the common and most generally\r\ndistributed white oak of southern New Mexico and Arizona where it\r\ncovers the hillsides and occurs in canyons at altitudes from 5,000 to\r\n10,000 feet above sea level. It occasionally ascends nearly or quite to\r\nthe summits of the highest peaks. The form of the tree varies greatly,\r\nas might be expected from a range extending from one to two miles above\r\nsea level. On the dry, windswept summits the tree degenerates into a\r\nshrub, with stiff, harsh branches. Lower down, in canyons and in other\r\nsituations where moisture may be had and the soil is fertile, trunks are\r\nfifty or sixty feet high and three or four in diameter; but these are\r\nnot the usual sizes even in the best of the tree’s range, for it cannot\r\nbe classed as a timber tree.\r\n\r\nThe hardships of the desert have stunted it, and its form is rough. It\r\nis important for fuel, and this has been its chief use. The region where\r\nit occurs is thinly settled, and demand for lumber is small, but\r\nstockmen build corrals and fences to enclose sheep and cattle, and the\r\nArizona white oak supplies some of the rough poles and posts for that\r\npurpose. The wood is heavy, hard, strong, and the heartwood is almost\r\nblack, but the sapwood is lighter. The grain and figure of the wood are\r\nnot attractive, and what little may be sawed into lumber in the future\r\nwill be rather low-grade. The branches are crooked and when cut into\r\ncordwood the ricks are so open that it is a common saying in the region\r\nthat “you can throw a dog through.” The wood burns well, and the demand\r\nfor fuel is large, in proportion to the population of the country.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of this oak are sometimes slightly lobed, and are sometimes\r\nnearly as smooth as willow leaves. They are light red and covered with\r\nhair when they unfold in the spring, but when mature they are dark\r\ngreen, and shiny. Acorns are one inch or less in length, and rather\r\nslender. They are very bitter, and wild animals are inclined to let them\r\nalone, unless pressed by hunger, and then eat them sparingly. This\r\ninsures good reproduction, provided other conditions are favorable.\r\nThough cordwood cutters may strip the large trees from the hills and\r\ncanyons, scrub growth may be expected to continue, particularly on high\r\nmountains, and in ravines where roads cannot be built.\r\n\r\n    NETLEAF OAK (_Quercus reticulata_) will never attract lumbermen in\r\n    this country, but sometime they may send to the Sierra Madre\r\n    mountains of Mexico to procure it. In that region it is a tree large\r\n    enough for lumber; but the portion of its range overlapping on the\r\n    United States lies in southern Arizona and New Mexico among\r\n    mountains from 7,000 to 10,000 feet above sea level. Conditions are\r\n    unfavorable and the netleaf oak shows it by its stunted size and\r\n    rough form. The wood is hard, heavy, dark brown in color, with\r\n    lighter sapwood. The medullary rays are numerous and very broad. The\r\n    tree seldom exceeds forty feet in height and one foot in diameter.\r\n    The leaf is netted somewhat like that of the elm. The acorn is\r\n    usually not more than half an inch in length.\r\n\r\n    ROCKY MOUNTAIN OAK (_Quercus undulata_) bears acorns which may be\r\n    eaten like chestnuts, and not much more may be said for the tree in\r\n    the way of usefulness to man, though it is the salvation of some of\r\n    the small mammals of the bleak Texas and New Mexico hills where\r\n    there is little to eat and few places for concealment from hawks and\r\n    other enemies. The tree is also called scrub oak and shin oak. It\r\n    grows in Colorado, New Mexico, western Texas, Arizona, Nevada, and\r\n    Utah. At its best it rarely exceeds thirty feet high and a foot in\r\n    diameter, and it often forms a jungle of shrubs through which the\r\n    traveler must wade waist deep or go miles out of his way to pass\r\n    round it. Its leaf is one of the smallest of the oaks, and is\r\n    notched much like the chestnut leaf.\r\n\r\n    ALVORD OAK (_Quercus alvordiana_) is little known and will probably\r\n    never be of much importance. It grows in the region of Tehachapi\r\n    mountains, the northern border of the Mojave desert, in California,\r\n    and was named for William Alvord of that state. The leaf is toothed,\r\n    and the acorn smooth. No record has been found of any use of the\r\n    wood, and when Sudworth compiled his book, “Forest Trees of the\r\n    Pacific Slope,” he was unable to procure enough leaves, flowers, and\r\n    fruit to enable him to give a botanical description. It may\r\n    therefore be regarded as one of the scarcest oaks in the United\r\n    States, which fact gives it a certain interest.\r\n\r\n    SADLER OAK (_Quercus sadleriana_) is one of the minor oaks of the\r\n    Pacific coast, and is popularly and properly called scrub oak by\r\n    those who encounter it on high, dry slopes of northern California\r\n    and southern Oregon mountains, from 4,000 to 9,000 feet above the\r\n    sea. It forms dense thickets, and passes for an evergreen. Its\r\n    leaves remain on the branches only thirteen months. The leaves are\r\n    toothed like those of chestnut. The acorns are matured in one\r\n    season. The name Sadler oak was given it in honor of a Scottish\r\n    botanist. Trees are too scarce and too small to have much value,\r\n    except as a ground cover.\r\n\r\n    BREWER OAK (_Quercus breweri_) grows on the west slope of the Sierra\r\n    Nevada mountains in California, from Kaweah river northward to\r\n    Trinity mountains. It is often little more than a shrub, and its\r\n    usefulness to man lies less in the quantity of wood it produces than\r\n    in the protection the dense thickets, with their network of roots,\r\n    afford steep hillsides. Gullying in time of heavy rain cannot take\r\n    place where this oak’s matted masses of roots bind the soil. Sprouts\r\n    rise freely from the roots, and thickets are reproduced in that way\r\n    rather than from acorns, although in certain years crops of acorns\r\n    are bountiful. The trunks are too small to make any kind of lumber,\r\n    but are capable of supplying considerable quantities of fuel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOST OAK\r\n\r\n[Illustration: POST OAK]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOST OAK\r\n\r\n(_Quercus Minor_)\r\n\r\n\r\nPost oak is the most common name for this tree but various sections of\r\nits range have given it their own names which probably have local\r\nsignificance. The following names are in use in the localities denoted:\r\npost oak in the eastern and Gulf states, Connecticut to Texas, and in\r\nArkansas and West Virginia; box white oak in Rhode Island; iron oak in\r\nDelaware, Mississippi and Nebraska; chêne étoile in Quebec; overcup oak\r\nin Florida; white oak in Kentucky and Indiana; box oak and brash oak in\r\nMaryland.\r\n\r\nToward the northern portion of the range of this tree it is small, and\r\nin early times it was little used except for fence posts. Its durability\r\nfitted it for that use, and it is said the common name was due to that\r\ncircumstance. The name iron oak was used by shipbuilders who sometimes\r\nbought small knees made of this wood. Baltimore oak was an early name\r\nwhich is not now in use. It was generally applied to white oak, but it\r\nincluded some post oak shipped from the Chesapeake bay region.\r\n\r\nPost oak is botanically and commercially a white oak and is seldom\r\ndistinguished from the true white oak, _Quercus alba_, in commerce. It\r\nis seen at its best in the uplands of the Mississippi basin and in the\r\nGulf states west of the Mississippi, where it attains a considerable\r\nsize. In the northeastern states and in Florida it is small, becoming\r\nshrubby in some localities, and more or less of local growth. Limestone\r\nuplands or dry, sandy or gravelly soils seem to offer the best\r\nconditions for its existence, where it grows in company with black jack,\r\nred and white oak, sassafras, dogwood, gums, and red cedar.\r\n\r\nThe range of growth of post oak extends from New Brunswick south through\r\nthe Atlantic states into Florida; west through the Gulf states and\r\nthroughout the Mississippi river system, growing west brokenly to\r\nMontana. It is the common oak of central Texas but in the North it is\r\nrather scarce, becoming more plentiful in the lower Appalachians.\r\n\r\nThe broad, dense, round-topped crown of the post oak with its peculiar\r\nfoliage make it very noticeable in the woods, even to the casual\r\nobserver. Its dark green looks almost black at a distance. The tree has\r\nan average height of sixty or eighty feet and is about two feet in\r\ndiameter, but in exceptional cases it reaches one hundred feet in height\r\nand has a diameter of three feet. It has a moderately thick, dark brown\r\nbark with a reddish tinge and deep fissures, the broad ridges being\r\ncovered with thin scales. On the branches it becomes much thinner, and\r\nlighter in color, the branchlets being unfissured and glabrous in the\r\nsecond year, although fuzzy at first. They are rather heavy and rounded\r\nand terminate in short round buds with conspicuous scales. A noticeable\r\nfeature of the tree is the peculiar branching. The limbs are heavy and\r\ncrooked, separating often, with wide angles, forming knees which when\r\nbig enough, have a commercial value.\r\n\r\nWhen the tree is in foliage the tufted appearance of the leaves grouped\r\non the ends of the twigs gives it a distinctive look. They bear some\r\nresemblance to a star, and for that reason some botanists have named the\r\nspecies _stellata_. The leaves are five or seven inches long usually,\r\nbut in some cases, especially on young specimens, they are ten or more\r\ninches long. They are dark, shiny-green and on a short petiole, the\r\nveins and midrib being heavy and conspicuous. The identification of\r\nthese leaves is easy as they are heavy in texture, are bilaterally\r\ndeveloped with a large, obtuse lobe on each side about in the middle,\r\ngiving them a maltese cross effect. They are very persistent, staying on\r\nthe tree until the new leaves push them off in the spring.\r\n\r\nThe form of post oak is not ideal from the lumberman’s viewpoint. The\r\ntree does not prune itself well. Straggling limbs adhere to the trunk\r\nand prevent the clean bole which often makes white oak so attractive.\r\n\r\nThe wood weighs 52.14 pounds per cubic foot. The name iron oak referred\r\nto the weight as well as the strength of the wood. It is rather\r\ndifficult to season, and is inclined to check badly. The medullary rays\r\nare broad and numerous, and checking is apt to develop along the rays.\r\nThe summerwood occupies about half of the annual ring, and is dense and\r\ndark colored. Large pores are abundant in the springwood, and smaller\r\nones in the summerwood.\r\n\r\nFormerly this tree was known in some sections as turkey oak, though the\r\nname is no longer heard, but is now applied to another oak in the South.\r\nThe acorns are small enough to be eaten by turkeys, and when those game\r\nbirds were wild in the woods they frequented parts of the forests where\r\npost oaks grew, and hunters knew where to find them. The uses of post\r\noak for building and manufacturing purposes are the same as for white\r\noak as far as they go, but post oak is not so extensively employed.\r\n\r\nThe earliest railroads in America were built in the region where post\r\noak of excellent quality grew, and it saw service from the first as\r\ncrossties, and car and bridge timbers. It is still used for those\r\npurposes. Its other important uses are as furniture material, both as\r\nsolid stock and veneer; interior finish and fixtures for offices, banks,\r\nand stores; musical instruments, including frames, braces, and veneers;\r\nbaskets, crates, and shipping boxes; vehicles, particularly tongues,\r\naxles, and hounds of heavy wagons; flooring, stair work, balusters.\r\n\r\nPost oak will do well on land too gravelly and thin to sustain good\r\nwhite oak growth. To that extent the two species are not competitors for\r\nground, and post oak is assured a place in future woodlots, but it\r\ncannot be expected ever to equal white oak in commercial importance,\r\nwhile as an ornamental tree it is not usually favored because the shape\r\nof its crown is not altogether pleasing. Its very dark foliage, however,\r\nis admired by many and gives the tree an individuality.\r\n\r\nSWAMP WHITE OAK (_Quercus platanoides_). This tree’s botanical name\r\nmeans “broadleaf oak,” and that is a good description as far as it goes,\r\nbut it does not apply solely to this species. The characteristic which\r\nfixes it best in the minds of most people is its preference for low, wet\r\nsoil. Its two common names are swamp oak and swamp white oak, yet it is\r\nnot really a swamp tree, such as the northern white cedar, southern\r\nwhite cedar, cypress, and tupelo are. It does not associate with any of\r\nthose trees. It prefers river banks, and does not object to a good deal\r\nof water about its roots, though it grows nicely in situations out of\r\nreach of all overflow, and often side by side with silver maple,\r\nhickory, ash, and several other oaks. The leaf resembles that of\r\nchestnut oak, and the bark is somewhat like chestnut oak, but the wood\r\npasses in market for white oak, and is a good substitute for it, though\r\nthe resemblance is not so close that one need be mistaken for the other.\r\nThe tree averages about seventy feet high with a diameter of two feet,\r\nbut much larger trunks are common. The famous “Wadsworth oak,” which\r\nstood on the bank of the Genesee river in western New York, about a mile\r\nfrom the village of Geneseo, was a swamp white oak. It had a trunk\r\ndiameter of nine feet, but it was not tall in proportion. It met its\r\noverthrow by the undermining of the river bank in time of flood. That is\r\na common fate for this tree, because of its preference for river banks.\r\nIts range is from Maine to Wisconsin and Iowa. It follows the mountains\r\nto northern Georgia; and west of the Mississippi it grows as far south\r\nas Arkansas. The species is best developed in western New York,\r\nnorthwestern Pennsylvania, and along the southern shores of Lakes Erie\r\nand Michigan.\r\n\r\nTrees do not clear themselves of branches on their lower trunks very\r\nearly in life, and lumber more or less knotty results. It is possible,\r\nhowever, to cut a fairly large proportion of clear boards. The wood is\r\nof about the same weight as white oak, and is hard, strong, and tough.\r\nIts color is light brown, and the thin sapwood is hardly distinguishable\r\nfrom the heart. The medullary rays are as large as those of white oak,\r\nbut are few. For that reason, swamp white oak does not give very\r\nsatisfactory results when quarter-sawed. The bright patches are too\r\nscarce. Neither does it show as many of these rays as chestnut oak. The\r\nwood is very porous, but the large pores are confined to the springwood,\r\nwhile the broad bands of summerwood are dense. The contrast between the\r\ntwo parts of annual rings forms a strong, but not particularly handsome\r\nfigure when the lumber is sawed tangentially--that is, from the side of\r\nthe log. The wood finisher can improve this oak’s natural appearance by\r\nemploying fillers and stains to lighten shades or deepen tints. The uses\r\nof this oak are numerous. It is excellent fuel, and is rather low in\r\nash; it is weaker and more brittle than white oak; but it is quite\r\nsatisfactory for railroad ties, car building, house finish, furniture,\r\nsome parts of heavy vehicles, certain kinds of cooperage, and for farm\r\nimplements.\r\n\r\n    ROCKY MOUNTAIN BLUE OAK (_Quercus oblongifolia_) is named from the\r\n    blue color of its foliage, though what little lumber is cut from it,\r\n    is bought and sold as white oak. It is of little importance, yet in\r\n    the almost timberless mountains of western Texas it supplies some of\r\n    the urgent wants of a scattered population. It bears willow-like\r\n    leaves one or two inches long, and less than an inch wide; but on\r\n    vigorous shoots they are larger. The acorns are very small. Trees\r\n    seldom exceed thirty feet in height, and a diameter of twenty\r\n    inches; and often the trunk is divided near the ground in three or\r\n    four stout, crooked forks. Ordinarily, it is an impossible tree to\r\n    lumber, but sometimes a few logs find their way to sawmills and a\r\n    little passable lumber is produced. The wood weighs 58 pounds per\r\n    cubic foot. It is strong, but when it breaks, it snaps short. The\r\n    heartwood is darker than in most oaks, and the sapwood is brown. The\r\n    tree is useful for fuel. Charcoal for local blacksmith shops is\r\n    manufactured from the wood. It is abundant on many of the sterile\r\n    slopes and mesas of New Mexico and Arizona, but usually in the form\r\n    of brush about the heads of canyons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOW OAK\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COW OAK]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOW OAK\r\n\r\n(_Quercus Michauxii_)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis oak’s acorns are remarkably free from the bitterness due to tannin\r\nand are therefore pleasant to the taste. Herbivorous animals eat them\r\nwhen they are to be had, and the eagerness with which cattle gather them\r\nin the fall is doubtless the reason for calling the tree cow oak. Hogs\r\nand sheep are as eager hunters for the acorns as cattle are, and the\r\nhalf-wild swine in the southern forests become marketable during the two\r\nmonths of the acorn season. Children know the excellency of the cow oak\r\nacorns, and gather them in large quantities during the early weeks of\r\nautumn in the South. The tree is widely known as basket oak, and the\r\nname refers to a prevailing use for the wood in early times, and a\r\nrather common use yet. Long before anyone had made a study of the\r\nstructure of this wood, it was learned that it splits nicely into long,\r\nslender bands, and these were employed by basket weavers for all sorts\r\nof wares in that line. Tens of thousands of baskets were in use before\r\nthe war in the southern cottonfields, and they have not gone out of use\r\nthere yet. It is safe to say that millions of dollars worth of cotton\r\nhas been picked and “toted” in baskets made of this oak. It was natural,\r\ntherefore, that the name basket oak should be given it. Large, coarse\r\nbaskets are still made of splits of this wood, and china and other\r\nmerchandise are packed in them; while baskets of finer pattern and\r\nworkmanship are doing service about the farms and homes of thousands of\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nWhen the structure of wood became a subject of study among\r\ndendrologists, the secret of the cow oak’s adaptability to basket making\r\nwas discovered. The annual rings of growth are broad, and the bands of\r\nspringwood and summerwood are distinct. The springwood is so perforated\r\nwith large pores that it contains comparatively little real wood\r\nsubstance. The early basket maker did not notice that but he found by\r\nexperimenting that the wood split along the rings of growth into fine\r\nribbons. The splitting occurs along the springwood. Ribbons may be\r\npulled off as thin as the rings of annual growth, that is, from an\r\neighth to a sixteenth of an inch thick. These are the “splits” of which\r\nbaskets are made. When subjected to rough usage, such as being dragged\r\nand hauled about cornfields and cotton plantations, such a basket will\r\noutlast two or three of willow.\r\n\r\nThe tree is sometimes called swamp white oak, and swamp chestnut oak. It\r\nbears some resemblance to the swamp white oak (_Quercus platanoides_)\r\nand some people believe that both are of one species, but of slightly\r\ndifferent forms. It is not surprising that there should be a conflict of\r\nnames and confusion in identification. The leaf resembles that of the\r\nchestnut oak, and to that fact is due the belief which some hold that\r\nthe chief difference between the trees is that the chestnut oak\r\n(_Quercus prinus_) grows on dry land and cow oak in damp situations.\r\nBotanists make a clear distinction between cow oak and all other\r\nspecies, though it closely resembles some of them in several\r\nparticulars.\r\n\r\nFrom the northern limits of its growth in Delaware, where it is not of\r\nany considerable size, it extends south through the Atlantic states and\r\ninto Florida, west in the Gulf states to the Trinity river in Texas, and\r\nup the Mississippi valley, including in its range Arkansas, eastern\r\nMissouri, southern Indiana and Illinois and western Kentucky and\r\nTennessee. It is distinctly of the South and may be considered the best\r\nsouthern representative of the white oak group. It does best in swampy\r\nlocalities where it is found in company with water hickory, sweet\r\nmagnolia, planer tree, water oak, willow oak, red maple, and red and\r\nblack gum.\r\n\r\nIn general appearance the tree gives the impression of massiveness and\r\nstrength, offset by the delicate, silvery effect of the bark and the\r\nlining of the foliage. The usual height is sixty or eighty feet, but it\r\noften exceeds a hundred feet, the bole attaining a diameter of as high\r\nas seven feet and showing three log lengths clear. The characteristic\r\nlight gray, scaly, white oak bark covers trunk and heavy limbs, which\r\nrise at narrow angles, forming a rounded head and dividing into stout\r\nbranches and twigs. The winter buds are not characteristic of white oak,\r\nbeing long and pointed rather than rounded. They are about a half inch\r\nin length, scaly, with red hairs and usually in threes on the ends of\r\nthe twigs. The general texture of the leaves is thick and heavy, their\r\nupper surfaces being dark, lustrous green and the lower white and\r\ncovered with hairs. They are from five to seven inches long with\r\npetioles an inch in length and of the general outline of the chestnut\r\nleaf. Their rich crimson color is conspicuous in the fall after turning.\r\n\r\nThe wood of cow oak is hard, heavy, very tough, strong, and durable. The\r\nheartwood is light brown, the sapwood darker colored. It weighs 50.10\r\npounds per cubic foot, and is not quite up to white oak in strength and\r\nelasticity. In quarter-sawing it does not equal white oak, because the\r\nmedullary rays, though broad, are not regularly distributed, and the\r\nsurface of the quarter-sawed board has a splotchy appearance, and it is\r\nnot as easy to match figures as with white oak.\r\n\r\nCow oak is one of the most important hardwoods of the South. Its uses\r\nare much the same as those for white oak farther north. The custom of\r\ncalling it white oak when it goes to market renders the collection of\r\nstatistics of uses difficult. Sawmills seldom or never list cow oak in\r\nmaking reports of cut. Factories which further manufacture lumber, after\r\nit leaves the mill, sometimes distinguish between cow oak and other\r\noaks. It has been found suitable material in the South for canthook\r\nhandles where it takes the place of hickory which is more expensive. It\r\nis reported for that use in considerable quantity in Louisiana. The\r\nhandles are subjected to great strain and violent shocks. The billets\r\nare split to the proper size, because if they are sawed they are liable\r\nto contain cross grain which is a fatal defect. The wood is cut in\r\ndimensions for chair stock and furniture, the better grades usually\r\ngoing to furniture factories. Defective logs, short lengths, and odds\r\nand ends may be worked into chair stock which contains a large\r\nproportion of small pieces. The making of large plantation baskets of\r\nthis wood is still a fairly large business in Louisiana and Mississippi.\r\nBraided bottoms of cheap chairs are of the same workmanship as baskets.\r\n\r\nVehicle makers in the South are large users of this wood. It is employed\r\nin heavy wagons chiefly, and is worked into many parts, including axles,\r\nbolsters, felloes, hubs, hounds, tongues, reaches, spokes, and\r\nbedbottoms.\r\n\r\nThis tree is classed as white oak by coopers who accept it as stave\r\nmaterial. The amount used is much less than of the true white oak, but\r\nthe exact quantity taken yearly by barrel makers is not known because\r\nstatistics do not list the different white oaks separately. Cow oak\r\nrives well when a trunk is found clear of knots. The trees are usually\r\nsmaller and less perfect than true white oak in the North.\r\n\r\nRailroads accept crossties of this species and they give as long service\r\nas white oak, are as hard, and hold spikes as well. The wood is accepted\r\nby car shops for use in repairs and in new work. Trunks are split or\r\nsawed into fence posts and are used in probably larger numbers than any\r\nother southern oak.\r\n\r\nThis tree’s future seems fairly well assured. It will further decline in\r\navailable supply, because it is cut faster than it is growing. That is\r\nthe status of all the timber oaks of this country. This one has\r\nadvantage over some of the others in that it occupies wet land which\r\nwill not soon be in demand for agricultural purposes, and young growth\r\nwill be left to develop.\r\n\r\n    ENGELMANN OAK (_Quercus engelmanni_) occupies a restricted range in\r\n    southwestern California where it is generally spoken of as a desert\r\n    tree; but its rate of growth appears to be much more rapid than is\r\n    usual with trees in arid situations. It occupies a narrow belt in\r\n    San Diego county and its range extends into Lower California. It\r\n    forms about one-third of the stand in Palomar mountains, and is much\r\n    scarcer in the Cuyamaca mountains. The tree seldom attains a height\r\n    greater than forty or fifty feet, or a diameter more than twenty or\r\n    thirty inches. The largest trees are of small value for lumber and\r\n    in rare instances only, if at all, do they go to sawmills. The\r\n    trunks fork and each branch forks, until a fairly large bole near\r\n    the ground is divided among numerous limbs. The tree’s chief value\r\n    is as fuel. It rates high as such. The leaves are bluish-green and\r\n    are thick with sharp points on their margins. The leaves vary\r\n    greatly in size, and are largest on young shoots. They remain a year\r\n    on the tree, and are classed as evergreen. The acorns ripen in one\r\n    year. This interesting species was named for Dr. George Engelmann,\r\n    whose name is borne also by Engelmann spruce. The wood is among the\r\n    heaviest of the oaks, exceeding white oak by more than twelve pounds\r\n    per cubic foot. It is brittle and weak, and very dark brown. The\r\n    green wood checks and warps badly in seasoning. The medullary rays\r\n    are numerous and large, but are so irregularly dispersed that\r\n    quarter-sawing promises no satisfactory results, even if logs of\r\n    suitable size could be found. The annual rings are indistinct, owing\r\n    to no clear line of separation between springwood and summerwood.\r\n    Pores are numerous, diffuse, and some of them large. The species is\r\n    entitled to recognition only because it is found in a region where\r\n    forests are scarce and scrubby, and every trunk has value as fuel,\r\n    if for nothing else. It affords a cover for hills which otherwise\r\n    would be barren, and it frequently occurs in fairly dense thickets.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPACIFIC POST OAK\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PACIFIC POST OAK]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPACIFIC POST OAK\r\n\r\n(_Quercus Garryana_)\r\n\r\n\r\nDavid Douglas named this tree the Garry oak, in honor of Nicholas Garry\r\nof the Hudson Bay Company, who furnished valuable assistance to\r\nbotanists and other explorers of early times in the northwestern parts\r\nof America. This tree is best developed in the neighborhood of Puget\r\nSound, the present state of Washington, and at the period of\r\nexplorations in that region by Douglas, who was a Scotchman, the country\r\nwas a sort of “no man’s land.” It was claimed by both England and the\r\nUnited States, and Russia had cast covetous eyes on it as a southern\r\nextension of her Alaska holdings. England at that time put a good deal\r\nof dependence in the Hudson Bay Company to get possession of and to hold\r\nas much country as possible, and Garry’s help given to explorers was\r\npart of a well-laid plan to possess as much of the northwestern country\r\nas possible. Douglas doubtless had that in mind when he named the oak in\r\nhonor of Garry. It was a witness and perpetual reminder that the Hudson\r\nBay Company’s strong arms had been stretched in that direction.\r\n\r\nThe people in California and Oregon often speak of the tree simply as\r\nwhite oak, but it is sometimes called Oregon white oak, and more often\r\nOregon oak without a qualifying word. When it is spoken of as western\r\nwhite oak, which frequently is the case, it is compared with the\r\nwell-known eastern white oak. It bears more resemblance to the eastern\r\npost oak (_Quercus minor_) and for that reason it has been named Pacific\r\npost oak. The leaves and twigs, particularly when they are young,\r\nresemble post oak.\r\n\r\nThe northern limit of the tree’s range crosses southern British\r\nColumbia. It is found in the lower valley of Frazer river and on\r\nVancouver island. It is the only oak tree of British Columbia. Its range\r\nextends southward to the Santa Cruz mountains in California, but near\r\nthe southern limit of its range it is found chiefly in valleys near the\r\ncoast. It is best developed in western Washington and Oregon. It occurs\r\nof good size on dry gravelly slopes of low hills; and it ascends the\r\nCascade mountains to considerable elevations, but becomes stunted and\r\nshrubby. It is abundant in northwestern California.\r\n\r\nThe tree has a height from sixty to a hundred feet; sometimes it attains\r\na diameter of three and one-half feet. It carries a broad and compact\r\ncrown, especially when the tree is surrounded by young coniferous growth\r\nas is the case in its best habitat where natural pruning gets rid of the\r\nlower limbs and causes an outward and later a pendulous growth of the\r\nupper part. The limbs are strong and heavy as are the branches and\r\ntwigs. The bark is a grayish-brown with shallow fissures, the broad\r\nridges being sometimes broken across forming square plates which are\r\ncovered with the grayish flakes or scales. The buds are long and acute,\r\nand are coated with a red fuzz. The leaves are from four to six inches\r\nlong and are bilaterally developed, having seven or nine coarse round\r\nlobes; the sinuses being rounded or rather shallow. The color is a dark\r\nlustrous green and the texture leathery.\r\n\r\nThe acorn is rather large being about an inch and a quarter in length\r\nand usually about half as broad as long; has a shallow cup covered with\r\npointed sometimes elongated scales.\r\n\r\nThis oak is one of the most important hardwoods of the far Northwest. It\r\nis often compared with the eastern white oak, but its physical\r\nproperties fall below that species in some important particulars. The\r\ntwo woods weigh about the same, but the eastern species is stronger and\r\nmore elastic, and is of better color and figure. All oaks season\r\nsomewhat slowly, but the Pacific post oak is hardly up to the average.\r\nIt is a common saying that it must remain two years on the sticks to fit\r\nit for the shop, but that time may be shortened in many instances.\r\nChecking must be carefully guarded against.\r\n\r\nSome of this oak is exceedingly tough, and when carefully sorted and\r\nprepared it is excellent material for heavy wagons; but the best comes\r\nfrom young and comparatively small trees. When they attain large size\r\nthey are apt to become brash. The tree usually grows rapidly, and is not\r\nold in proportion to the size of its trunk. An examination of the wood\r\nshows broad bands of summerwood and narrow, very porous springwood. The\r\nmedullary rays are broad and numerous, and ought to show well in\r\nquarter-sawed stock; but it does not appear that much quarter-sawing has\r\nbeen done.\r\n\r\nPractically all of this species cut in the United States is credited to\r\nOregon in the census of sawmill output in 1910. The cut was 2,887,000\r\nfeet, and was produced by fourteen sawmills, while in Washington only\r\none mill reported any oak, and the quantity was only 4,000 feet. On the\r\nnorthwest Pacific coast it comes in competition with eastern oak and\r\nalso with Siberian or Japanese oak.\r\n\r\nBasket makers put this wood to considerable use. Young trees are\r\nselected on account of their toughness. The wood is either split in\r\nlong, thin ribbons for basket weaving, or it is first made into veneer\r\nand then cut in ribbons of required width. The largest users are\r\nfurniture makers, but boat yards find it convenient material and it\r\ntakes the place of imported oak for frames, keels, ribs, sills, and\r\ninterior finish. It is durable, and it may be depended upon for long\r\nservice in any part of boat construction. Its toughness fits it for ax,\r\nhammer, and other handles. It is far inferior to hickory, but on the\r\nPacific coast it can be had much cheaper. Its strength and durability\r\nmake it one of the best western woods for insulator pins for telephone\r\nand telegraph lines. It is worked into saddle trees and stirrups.\r\n\r\nThe scarcity of woods on the Pacific coast suitable for tight cooperage\r\ngives this oak a rather important place, because barrels and casks made\r\nof it hold alcoholic liquors. Available statistics do not show the\r\nquantity of staves produced from this wood, but it is known to be used\r\nfor staves in Oregon.\r\n\r\nMuch Pacific post oak is employed as rough lumber for various purposes.\r\nRailroads buy crossties, hewed or sawed from small trunks, and country\r\nbridges are occasionally floored with thick planks which wear well and\r\noffer great resistance to decay.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of this oak growing in the Northwest is not known. It falls\r\nfar below some of the softwoods of the same region, and the area on\r\nwhich it is found in commercial amounts is not large. It is holding its\r\nground fairly well. Trees bear full crops of acorns frequently, and if\r\nthey fall on damp humus they germinate and grow. The seedlings imitate\r\nthe eastern white oak, and send tap roots deep into the ground, and are\r\nthen prepared for fortune or adversity. It happens, however, that trees\r\nwhich bear the most bountiful crops of acorns do not stand in forests\r\nwhere the ground is damp and humus abundant, but on more open ground on\r\ngrass covered slopes. Acorns which fall on sod seldom germinate, and\r\nconsequently few seedlings are to be seen in such situations. Open-grown\r\ntrees are poorly suited for lumber, on account of many limbs low on the\r\ntrunks, but they grow large amounts of cordwood.\r\n\r\n    CALIFORNIA SCRUB OAK (_Quercus dumosa_) has been a puzzle to\r\n    botanists, and a hopeless enigma to laymen. Some would split the\r\n    species into no fewer than three species and three varieties, basing\r\n    distinctions on forms of leaves and acorns and other botanical\r\n    differences; but Sudworth, after a prolonged study of this matter,\r\n    recognized only one species and one variety, but admitted that\r\n    “California scrub oak unquestionably varies more than all other oaks\r\n    in the form and size of its leaves and acorns.” He thought it might\r\n    possibly be equalled in that respect by _Quercus undulata_ of the\r\n    Rocky Mountains. Some of the leaves of California scrub oak are\r\n    three-fourths of an inch long and half an inch wide, while others\r\n    may be four inches long. The edges of some leaves are as briery as\r\n    the leaves of holly, others are comparatively smooth. The shapes and\r\n    sizes of acorns vary as much as the leaves. Some are long and\r\n    slender, others short and stocky. This peculiar oak is found only in\r\n    California, but it shows a disposition to advance as far as possible\r\n    into the sea, for it has gained a foothold on islands lying off the\r\n    California coast, and it there finds its most acceptable habitat. It\r\n    reaches its largest size in sheltered canyons on the islands, and\r\n    attains a height of twenty or twenty-five feet, and a diameter of a\r\n    foot or less. It is not large enough to win favor with lumbermen but\r\n    in its scrubby form it is abundant in many localities. It is\r\n    scattered over several thousand square miles, from nearly sea level\r\n    up to 7,000 feet in the mountains of southern California. It is\r\n    found scattered through the coast range and the Sierra Nevadas from\r\n    Mendocino county to Lower California, 700 miles or more. It grows\r\n    from sprouts and from acorns. The leaves adhere to the twigs\r\n    thirteen months, and fall after the new crop has appeared. The wood\r\n    is light brown, hard, and brittle. No use is made of it, except to a\r\n    small extent for fuel. On the mountains it grows in thickets\r\n    scarcely five feet high, but they cover the ground in dense jungles,\r\n    and the roots go deep in the ground. The species is valuable chiefly\r\n    for protection to steep slopes which would otherwise be without much\r\n    growth of any kind. Being low on the ground, forest fires are\r\n    particularly destructive to this oak; but its ability to send up\r\n    sprouts repairs the damage to some extent.\r\n\r\n    EMORY OAK (_Quercus emoryi_) grows among the mountains of western\r\n    Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona, attains a height from thirty to\r\n    seventy feet, and a diameter from one to four. The largest size is\r\n    found only in sheltered canyons, while on high mountains and in\r\n    exposed situations the tree degenerates to a shrub. It always has a\r\n    crop of leaves. The old do not fall until the new appear. In shape,\r\n    the leaves somewhat resemble those of box elder. The acorns ripen\r\n    from June to September, the exact time depending upon the tree’s\r\n    situation. Trunks large enough for use are not scarce, but the wood\r\n    is not of high class. Stair railing and balusters have been made of\r\n    it in Texas, but the appearance is rather poor. The grain is coarse,\r\n    the figure common, the color unsatisfactory. The heart is very dark,\r\n    but the tones are not uniform, and flat surfaces, such as boards and\r\n    panels, show streaks which are not sufficiently attractive to be\r\n    taken for figure. Trunks are apt to be full of black knots which mar\r\n    the appearance of the lumber. The medullary rays are numerous and\r\n    broad, and in quarter-sawing, the size and arrangement of the\r\n    “mirrors” are all that could be desired, but they have a decidedly\r\n    pink color which does not contrast very well with the rest of the\r\n    wood. The weight of this oak exceeds per cubic foot white oak, by\r\n    more than ten pounds; but it has scarcely half the strength or half\r\n    the elasticity of white oak. The springwood is filled with large\r\n    pores, the summerwood with smaller ones. It rates high as fuel, and\r\n    that is its chief value. Large quantities are cut for cordwood.\r\n    Railroad ties are made of it, and more or less goes into mines as\r\n    props and lagging. Stock ranches make fences, sheds, and corrals of\r\n    this oak, and live stock eats the acorns. The human inhabitants\r\n    likewise find the Emory oak acorn crop a source of food. Mexicans\r\n    gather them in large quantities and sell what they can spare. The\r\n    market for the acorns is found in towns in northwestern Mexico.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHESTNUT OAK\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHESTNUT OAK]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHESTNUT OAK\r\n\r\n(_Quercus Prinus_)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis tree is known as rock oak in New York; as rock chestnut oak in\r\nMassachusetts and Rhode Island; as rock oak and rock chestnut oak in\r\nPennsylvania and Delaware; as tanbark oak and swampy chestnut oak in\r\nNorth Carolina and as rock chestnut oak and mountain oak in Alabama.\r\n\r\nThere is a pretty general disposition to call this tree rock oak. The\r\nname refers to the hardness of the wood, and is not confined to this\r\nspecies. Other oaks are also given that name, and the adjective “rock”\r\nis applied to two or three species of elm which possess wood remarkable\r\nfor its hardness. Cedar and pine are likewise in the class. In all of\r\nthese classes “rock” is employed to denote hardness of wood. Iron as an\r\nadjective or ironwood as a noun is used in the same way for a number of\r\ntrees. The name swampy chestnut oak as applied in some parts of the\r\nSouth to this tree, is hardly descriptive, for it is less a swamp tree\r\nthan most of the oaks, though it does often grow along the banks of\r\nstreams.\r\n\r\nIts distribution ranges from the coast of southern Maine and the Blue\r\nHills of eastern Massachusetts southward to Delaware and the District of\r\nColumbia; along the Appalachian mountains to northern Georgia and\r\nAlabama; westward to the shores of Lake Champlain and the valley of the\r\nGenesee river, New York; along the northern shores of Lake Erie and to\r\ncentral Kentucky and Tennessee. It is rare and local in New England and\r\nOntario, but plentiful on the banks of the lower Hudson river and on the\r\nAppalachian mountains from southern New York to Alabama. It reaches its\r\nbest development in the region from West Virginia to North Carolina,\r\npretty high on the ridges flanking the mountain ranges.\r\n\r\nLeaves are alternate, from five to nine inches long, with coarse teeth\r\nrounded at the top. At maturity, they are thick and firm, yellow-green\r\nand rather lustrous on the upper surface, paler and usually hairy\r\nbeneath. In the autumn before falling, they turn a dull orange color or\r\nrusty-brown.\r\n\r\nThe flowers appear in May and are solitary or paired on short spurs. The\r\nfruit or acorn is solitary or in pairs, one or two and one-half inches\r\nlong, very lustrous and of a bright chestnut-brown color. The acorn cup\r\nis thin, downy-lined and covered with small scales. The kernel is sweet\r\nand edible. The bark of the chestnut oak is thin, smooth, purplish-brown\r\nand often lustrous on young stems and small branches, becoming a thick,\r\ndark, reddish-brown, or nearly black on old trunks, and divided into\r\nbroad rounded ridges, separating on the surface into small, closely\r\nappressed scales. The bark of the tree is so dark in color and so deeply\r\nfurrowed that it has often been mistaken for one of the black oak group,\r\nalthough its wavy leaf margins and annual fruit clearly differentiate it\r\nfrom those species. The bark of the chestnut oak is thicker and rougher\r\non old trunks than on any other oak.\r\n\r\nThe bark of chestnut oak has long been valuable for tanning. There is\r\ntannin in the bark of all oaks, and several of them contain it in paying\r\nquantities, but chestnut oak is more important to the leather industry\r\nthan any other oak. In richness of tannin the tanbark oak of California\r\noccupies as high a place, but it is not supplying as much material as\r\nthe eastern tree. Statistics showing the annual consumption of tanbark\r\nand tanning extracts in the United States, do not list the oaks\r\nseparately, but it is well known that chestnut oak far surpasses all\r\nothers in output. Hemlock bark is peeled in large quantities, but\r\ntanneries occasionally mix chestnut oak bark with it to lighten the deep\r\nred color imparted to leather when hemlock bark is the sole material\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\nLarge quantities of chestnut oak timber have been destroyed to procure\r\nthe bark. Fortunately, it is a practice not much indulged in at present,\r\nbecause the wood now has value, but it formerly had little. It was then\r\nabandoned in the forest after the bark was peeled and hauled away. The\r\nsame practice obtained with hemlock years ago. Much chestnut oak is\r\nstill cut primarily for the bark, but the logs are worth hauling to\r\nsawmills, unless in remote districts.\r\n\r\nThe chestnut oak is a vigorous tree and grows rapidly in dry soil, where\r\nit often forms a great part of the forest. It is not as large as the\r\nwhite oak or red oak, but is a splendid tree, its bole being very\r\nsymmetrical and holding its size well. It grows usually to a height of\r\nfrom sixty to seventy feet and sometimes 100 feet, with a diameter of\r\nfrom two to five feet and occasionally as large as seven feet.\r\n\r\nThe form of the tree shows great variation, depending upon the situation\r\nin which it grows. Trees in open ground often divide into forks or large\r\nlimbs, and the trunks are short and of poor form. Open-grown trees show\r\na decided tendency to develop crooked boles, and unduly large branches.\r\nNo such objection can be urged against it when it grows under forest\r\nconditions. Trunks are straight and are otherwise of good form.\r\n\r\nThe wood of chestnut oak differs little from that of white oak in\r\nweight, strength, and stiffness. It is hard, rather tough, durable in\r\ncontact with the soil, and is darker in color than white oak. It has\r\nfew large, open pores, and requires less filler in finishing than most\r\noaks. There are many pores, however, and those in the springwood are\r\narranged in bands. The summerwood is broad and distinct, usually\r\nconstituting three-fourths of the annual ring. The medullary rays are as\r\nbroad and numerous as in the best furniture oaks. They are regularly\r\narranged, and spaces between them do not vary much in width. The wood\r\nquarter-saws well.\r\n\r\nThe wood has the fault of checking badly in seasoning, unless carefully\r\nattended to. In recent years, these difficulties have been largely\r\novercome, both in air seasoning and in the drykiln.\r\n\r\nChestnut oak has a wide range of uses. It is classed as white oak in\r\nmany markets, but few users buy it believing it to be true white oak. It\r\nis coming year by year to stand more on its own merits. Some sawmills\r\nwhich formerly piled it and sold it with other oaks, now keep it\r\nseparate, and some factories which once took it only because it came\r\nmixed with other oaks, now buy it for special uses, and make high-class\r\ncommodities of it. One of these is mission furniture, which has become\r\nfashionable in recent years. Chestnut oak possesses good fuming\r\nproperties, and this constitutes much of its value as furniture\r\nmaterial.\r\n\r\nThe wood is found in factories where general furniture is made. It is\r\nlargely frame material for furniture though some of it is for outside\r\nfinish. It is employed as frames in Maryland in the construction of\r\ncanal boats, and the annual demand for that purpose is about a quarter\r\nof a million feet in that state.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important places for chestnut oak is in the shop which\r\nmakes vehicles. It goes into sills for both heavy and light bodies,\r\nbolsters, and wagon bottoms. It has become a favorite wagon wood in\r\nEngland and in continental Europe, and there passes as white oak, though\r\ndealers well know that it is not the true white oak. There is no\r\nindication that demand for it will lessen, for it possesses many\r\ncharacters which fit it for vehicle making.\r\n\r\nIn Michigan more chestnut oak is reported by car builders than by any\r\nother class of manufacturers, though wagon makers buy it. Car shops use\r\nabout 220,000 feet a year, and work it into hand cars, push cars,\r\ntrack-laying cars, and cattle guards.\r\n\r\nThe large remaining area of timber growth in which chestnut oak appears\r\nis the Appalachian range through eastern Tennessee and western North\r\nCarolina, and the fact that it is comparatively plentiful in the forests\r\nof the Appalachian range will tend to bring it more and more into\r\nprominence as a factor in the making of wagons, cars, boats, staves, and\r\nfurniture as the other oaks become scarcer.\r\n\r\nThe probable future of chestnut oak is an interesting problem for\r\nstudy. Few steps have yet been taken looking toward providing for\r\ngenerations to come. Chestnut oak has been left to take care of itself.\r\nThe trees, produced in nature’s way, have been ample to supply all needs\r\nin the past, and they will be for the near future. Chestnut oak\r\npossesses some advantages over most of the other oaks. Large trees will\r\ngrow on very poor soil, where most other oaks are little more than\r\nshrubs. Trees so grown are little more susceptible to disease than if\r\nproduced in good soil, though they develop more slowly and are smaller.\r\nThere are many poor flats and sterile ridges in the chestnut oak’s\r\nrange, and they will produce timber of fairly good kind, if the chestnut\r\noaks are permitted to have them. Nature gave this tree facilities for\r\ntaking possession. Its acorns will grow without being buried. They do\r\nnot depend on blue jays to carry them to sunny openings or squirrels to\r\nplant them; but they will sprout where they fall, whether on hard\r\ngravelly soil or dry leaves; and they at once set about getting the tap\r\nroots of the future trees into the ground. In many instances the\r\nchestnut oak’s acorns do not wait to fall from the tree before they\r\nsprout. Like the seed of the Florida mangrove, they are often ready to\r\ntake root the day they touch the ground. The large acorn is stored with\r\nplantfood which sustains the growing germ for some time, and the ground\r\nmust be very hard and exceedingly dry if a young chestnut oak is not\r\nsoon firmly established, and good for two or three hundred years, if let\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nThe forester who may undertake to grow chestnut oaks must exercise great\r\ncare in transplanting the seedlings, or the tap roots will be broken and\r\nthe young trees will die. The best plan is to drop acorns on the ground\r\nwhere trees are expected to grow, and nature will do the rest, provided\r\nbirds and beasts leave the acorns alone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHINQUAPIN OAK\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHINQUAPIN OAK]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHINQUAPIN OAK\r\n\r\n(_Quercus Acuminata_)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis tree is known as yellow chestnut oak, chinquapin oak, chestnut oak,\r\npin oak, yellow oak, scrub oak, dwarf chestnut oak, shrub oak, and rock\r\noak. It should not be confused with _Quercus prinus_, the true chestnut\r\noak, although it is commonly known in so many sections of the country by\r\nthe latter name; the names yellow oak, pin oak, and scrub oak are\r\nlikewise applied to many species, so that the only way to accurately\r\ndesignate members of this great family is to employ their botanical\r\nnames. However, this species should always be known as the chinquapin\r\noak, which is a distinctive term, and not applied to any other.\r\n\r\nThe bark of this tree is light gray and is broken into thin flakes,\r\nsilvery-white, sometimes slightly tinted with brown, rarely half an inch\r\nthick. The branchlets are marked with pale lenticels.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of the chinquapin oak are from five to seven inches long,\r\nsimple and alternate; they have a taper-pointed apex and blunt,\r\nwedge-shaped or pointed base; are sharply toothed. When unfolding they\r\nshow bright bronze-green above, tinged with purple, and are covered\r\nunderneath with light silvery down; at maturity they become thick and\r\nfirm, showing greenish-yellow on the upper surface and silvery-white\r\nbelow. The midrib is conspicuous and the veins extending outward to the\r\npoints of the teeth are well-defined. In autumn the leaves turn orange\r\nand scarlet and are very showy. The leaves are narrow, hardly two inches\r\nwide, and more nearly resemble those of the chestnut than do any other\r\noak leaves. In their broadest forms they are also similar to those of\r\nthe true chestnut oak, although the difference in the quality and color\r\nof the bark, and of the leaves, would prevent either tree from being\r\nmistaken for the other. They are crowded at the ends of the branches and\r\nhang in such a manner as to show their under surfaces with every touch\r\nof breeze. This characteristic gives the chinquapin oak a peculiar\r\neffect of constantly shifting color which is one of its most attractive\r\nfeatures and which puts the observer in mind of the trembling aspen,\r\nalthough the shading and coloring of the oak is much more striking.\r\n\r\nThis tree’s range extends from northern New York, along Lake Champlain\r\nand the Hudson river westward through southern Ontario, and southward\r\ninto parts of Nebraska and Kansas; on its eastern boundary it extends as\r\nfar south as the District of Columbia and along the upper Potomac; the\r\ngrowth west of the Alleghany mountains reaches into central Alabama and\r\nMississippi, through Arkansas and the northern portion of Louisiana to\r\nthe eastern part of Oklahoma and parts of Texas even to the canyons of\r\nthe Guadalupe mountains, in the extreme western part of that state. It\r\nis a timber tree of much importance in Texas, and in 1910 manufacturers\r\nreported the use of 1,152,000 feet in that state, largely for making\r\nfurniture and vegetable crates.\r\n\r\nThe chinquapin oak is named from the form of its leaf. Its acorn bears\r\nno resemblance to the nut of chinquapin. Trees average smaller in size\r\nthan white oak, but when all circumstances are favorable they compare\r\nwell with any of the other oaks. In the lower Wabash valley, trees of\r\nthis species were found in the original forests 160 feet high and four\r\nor five in diameter. When it grows in crowded stands it develops a tall,\r\nsymmetrical trunk, clear of limbs; but it is shorter in open growth. The\r\nbase is often much buttressed.\r\n\r\nThe wood is very heavy, hard, strong, stiff, and durable. In color the\r\nheartwood is dark, the sapwood lighter. The springwood is narrow and\r\nfilled with large pores, the summerwood broad and dense. Medullary rays\r\nare less numerous and scarcely as broad as in chestnut oak, which this\r\nwood resembles. It checks badly in drying, both by kiln and in the open\r\nair; but when properly seasoned it is an excellent wood for most\r\npurposes for which white oak is used. It shows fewer figures when\r\nquarter-sawed than white oak shows, but it is satisfactory for many\r\nkinds of furniture, particularly when finished in mission style.\r\n\r\nRailroads throughout the region where this species is found have laid\r\nchinquapin oak ties in their tracks for many years and they give long\r\nservice, because they resist decay and are hard enough to stand the wear\r\nof the rails. In early times in the Ohio valley it helped to fence many\r\na farm when the material for such fences was the old style fence rail,\r\neleven feet long, mauled from the straightest, clearest timber afforded\r\nby the primeval forest. It had for companions many other oaks which were\r\nabundant there, and it was on a par with the best of them. In the first\r\nyears of steamboating on the Ohio river, when the engines used wood for\r\nfuel, they provided a market for many an old rail fence. The rails were\r\nthe best obtainable fuel, and the chinquapin oak rails in the heaps were\r\ncarefully looked for by the purchasers, because they were rated high in\r\nfuel value. It is now known that chinquapin oak in combustion develops\r\nconsiderably more heat than an equal quantity of white oak.\r\n\r\nWhen southern Indiana and Illinois were furnishing coopers with their\r\nbest staves, chinquapin oak was ricked with white oak, and no barrel\r\nmaker ever complained. The pores in the wood seem large, but in old\r\ntimber which is largely heartwood, the pores become clogged by the\r\nprocesses of nature, and the wood is made proof against leakage. That is\r\nwhat gives white oak its superiority as stave timber. It has as many\r\npores as red oak, but upon close examination under a magnifying glass,\r\nthey are found to be plugged, while red oak’s pores are wide open. The\r\nresult is that red oak barrels leak through the wood; those made of\r\nwhite oak do not. Chinquapin oak possesses the same properties, which\r\naccount for its reputation as stave material.\r\n\r\nThe future for chinquapin oak is not quite as promising as that of\r\nchestnut oak. The former’s choice growing place is on rich soil and in\r\ndamp situations. These happen to be what the farmer wants, and he will\r\nnot leave the chinquapin oak alone to grow in nature’s method, nor will\r\nhe plant its acorns in places where the trees will interfere with his\r\ncornfields and meadows. Consequently, the tree is apt to receive scant\r\nconsideration after the original forests have disappeared; while its\r\npoor cousin, the chestnut oak, will be left to make its way on sterile\r\nridges, and may even receive some help from the forester and woodlot\r\nowner.\r\n\r\n    VALLEY OAK (_Quercus lobata_) is often considered to be the largest\r\n    hardwood of the Pacific coast. Trunk diameters of ten feet have been\r\n    recorded, and heights more than 100; but such measurements belong\r\n    only to rare and extraordinary individuals. The average size of the\r\n    tree is less than half of that. The most famous tree of this species\r\n    is the Sir Joseph Hooker oak, near Chico, California, though it is\r\n    not the largest. It is seven feet in diameter and 100 high. It was\r\n    named by the botanist Asa Gray in 1877. This species is commonly\r\n    called California white oak, which name would be unobjectionable if\r\n    it were the only white oak in California. A more distinctive name is\r\n    weeping oak, which refers to the appearance of the outer branches.\r\n    It is called swamp oak, but without good reason, though the ground\r\n    on which it grows is often swampy during the rainy season. The name\r\n    valley oak is specially appropriate, since its favorite habitat is\r\n    in the broad valleys of central California. Its range does not go\r\n    outside that state, neither does the tree grow very high on the\r\n    mountains. Its range begins in the upper Sacramento valley and\r\n    extends to Tejon, south of Lake Tulare, a distance north and south\r\n    of about five hundred miles, while east and west the tree is found\r\n    from the Sierra foothills to the sea, 150 or 200 miles. Its\r\n    characteristic growth is in scattered stands. It does not form\r\n    forests in the ordinary sense. Two or three large trees to the acre\r\n    are an average, and often many acres are wholly missed. The form of\r\n    trees, and the wide spaces between them, resemble an old apple\r\n    orchard, though few apple trees live to attain the dimensions of the\r\n    valley oak of ordinary size. The best stands were originally in the\r\n    Santa Clara valley and in the central part of the San Joaquin valley\r\n    in the salt grass region north of Lake Tulare in Kings and Fresno\r\n    counties. Most of the largest trees were cut long ago.\r\n\r\n    The leaves are lobed like white oak (_Quercus alba_) but are\r\n    smaller, seldom more than four inches long and two wide. The acorns\r\n    are uncommonly long, some of them being two and a half inches, sharp\r\n    pointed, with shallow cups. The wood of this oak is brash and breaks\r\n    easily. It is far below good eastern oak in strength and elasticity.\r\n    It weighs 46.17 pounds per cubic foot. The tree grows rapidly, and\r\n    its wide, clearly defined annual rings are largely dense summerwood.\r\n    The springwood is perforated with large pores. The color of the wood\r\n    is light brown, the sapwood lighter. Except as fuel, the uses found\r\n    for valley oak hardly come up to what might be expected of a tree so\r\n    large. It is not difficult, or at least was not difficult once, to\r\n    cut logs sixteen feet long and from three to five in diameter. Such\r\n    logs ought to make good lumber. The medullary rays indicate that the\r\n    wood can be quarter-sawed to advantage; yet there is no account that\r\n    any serious attempt was ever made to convert the valley oak into\r\n    lumber. The wood has some objectionable properties, but it has\r\n    escaped the sawmill chiefly because hardwood mills have never been\r\n    numerous in California, and they have been especially few in the\r\n    regions where the best valley oaks grow. The tree has been a great\r\n    source of fuel. It usually divides twenty or thirty feet from the\r\n    ground into large, wide-spreading branches, tempting to the\r\n    woodchopper. In central California, twenty or thirty years ago, it\r\n    was not unusual to haul this cordwood twenty-five miles to market.\r\n    Stockmen employed posts and rails split from valley oak to enclose\r\n    corrals and pens on the open plains for holding cattle, sheep, and\r\n    horses. The acorns are edible, and were formerly an article of food\r\n    for Indians who gathered them in considerable quantities in the fall\r\n    and stored them for winter in large baskets which were secured high\r\n    in the forks of trees to be out of reach of all ordinary marauders.\r\n    The baskets were made rain proof by roofing and wrapping them with\r\n    grass. When the time came for eating the acorns, they were prepared\r\n    for use by hulling them and then pounding them into meal in stone\r\n    mortars. The hulling was done with the teeth, and was the work of\r\n    squaws. The custom of eating the acorns has largely ceased with the\r\n    passing of the wild Indians from their former camping places; but\r\n    the stone mortars by hundreds remain in the vicinity of former\r\n    stands of valley oak.\r\n\r\n    This splendid tree is highly ornamental, but it has not been\r\n    planted, and perhaps it will not become popular. Nature seems to\r\n    have confined it to a certain climate, and it is not known that it\r\n    will thrive outside of it. It will certainly disappear from many of\r\n    the valleys where the largest trees once grew. The land is being\r\n    taken for fields and vineyards, and the oaks are removed. Some will\r\n    remain in canyons and rough places where the land is not wanted, and\r\n    one of the finest species of the United States will cease to pass\r\n    entirely from earth. The largest of these oaks have a spread of\r\n    branches covering more than one-third of an acre.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIVE OAK\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LIVE OAK]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIVE OAK\r\n\r\n(_Quercus Virginiana_)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of this live oak is a reversal of the history of almost\r\nevery other important forest tree of the United States. It seems to be\r\nthe lone exception to the rule that the use of a certain wood never\r\ndecreases until forced by scarcity. There was a time when hardly any\r\nwood in this country was in greater demand than this, and now there is\r\nhardly one in less demand. The decline has not been the result of\r\nscarcity, for there has never been a time when plenty was not in sight.\r\nA few years ago, several fine live oaks were cut in making street\r\nchanges in New Orleans, and a number of sound logs, over three feet in\r\ndiameter, were rolled aside, and it was publicly announced that anyone\r\nwho would take them away could have them. No one took them. It is\r\ndoubtful if that could happen with timber of any other kind.\r\n\r\nThe situation was different 120 years ago. At that time live oak was in\r\nsuch demand that the government, soon after the adoption of the\r\nconstitution, became anxious lest enough could not be had to meet the\r\nrequirements of the navy department. The keels of the first war vessels\r\nbuilt by this government were about to be laid, and the most necessary\r\nmaterial for their construction was live oak. The vessels were to be of\r\nwood, of course; and their strength and reliability depended upon the\r\nsize and quality of the heavy braces used in the lower framework. These\r\nbraces were called knees and were crooked at right angles. They were\r\nhewed in solid pieces, and the largest weighed nearly 1,000 pounds. No\r\nother wood was as suitable as live oak, which is very strong, and it\r\ngrows knees in the form desired. The crooks produced by the junction of\r\nlarge roots with the base of the trunk were selected, and shipbuilders\r\nwith saws, broadaxes, and adzes cut them in the desired sizes and\r\nshapes.\r\n\r\nWhen the building of the first ships of the navy was undertaken, the\r\nalarm was sounded that live oak was scarce, and that speculators were\r\nbuying it to sell to European governments. Congress appropriated large\r\nsums of money and bought islands and other lands along the south\r\nAtlantic and Gulf coast, where the best live oak grew. In Louisiana\r\nalone the government bought 37,000 live oak trees, as well as large\r\nnumbers in Florida and Georgia. In some instances the land on which the\r\ntrees stood was bought.\r\n\r\nShip carpenters were sent from New England to hew knees for the first\r\nvessels of the navy. The story of the troubles and triumphs of the\r\ncontractors and knee cutters is an interesting one, but too long for\r\neven a summary here; suffice it that in due time the vessels were\r\nfinished. The history of those vessels is almost a history of the early\r\nUnited States navy. Among their first duties when they put to sea was to\r\nfight French warships, when this country was about to get into trouble\r\nwith Napoleon. They then fought the pirates of North Africa, and there\r\none of the ships was burned by its own men to prevent its falling into\r\nthe hands of the enemy. “Old Ironsides,” another of the live oak\r\nvessels, fought fourteen ships, one at a time, during the war of 1812,\r\nand whipped them all. Another of the vessels was less fortunate. It was\r\nlost in battle, in which its commander, Lawrence, was killed, whose last\r\nwords have become historic: “Don’t give up the ship.” Another came down\r\nto the Civil war and was sunk in Chesapeake bay.\r\n\r\nThe invention of iron vessels ended the demand for live oak knees. The\r\ngovernment held its land where this timber grew for a long time, but\r\nfinally disposed of most of it. Part of that owned in Florida was\r\nrecently incorporated in one of the National Forests of that state.\r\n\r\nLive oak is a tree of striking appearance. It prefers the open, and when\r\nof large size its spread of branches often is twice the height of the\r\ntree. Its trunk is short, but massy, and of enormous strength; otherwise\r\nit could not sustain the great weight of its heavy branches. Some of the\r\nlargest limbs are nearly two feet in diameter where they leave the\r\ntrunk, and are fifty feet long, and some are seventy-five feet in\r\nlength. Probably the only tree in this country with a wider spread of\r\nbranches is the valley oak of California. The live oak’s trunk is too\r\nshort for more than one sawlog, and that of moderate length. The largest\r\nspecimens may be seventy feet high and six or seven feet in diameter,\r\nand yet not good for a sixteen-foot log. The enormous roots are of no\r\nuse now. When land is cleared of this oak, the stumps are left to rot.\r\n\r\nThe range of live oak extends 4,000 miles or more northeast and\r\nsouthwest. It begins on the coast of Virginia and ends in Central\r\nAmerica. It is found in Lower California and in Cuba. In southern United\r\nStates it sticks pretty closely to the coastal plains, though large\r\ntrees grow 200 or 300 feet above tide level. In Texas it is inclined to\r\nrise higher on the mountains, but live oak in Texas seldom measures up\r\nto that which grows further east. In southern Texas, where the land is\r\npoor and dry, live oak degenerates into a shrub. Trees only a foot high\r\nsometimes bear acorns. In all its range in this country, it is known by\r\nbut one English name, given it because it is evergreen. The leaves\r\nremain on the tree about thirteen months, following the habit of a\r\nnumber of other oaks. When new leaves appear, the old ones get out of\r\nthe way.\r\n\r\nThe wood is very heavy, hard, strong, and tough. In strength and\r\nstiffness it rates higher than white oak, and it is twelve pounds a\r\ncubic foot heavier. The sapwood is light in color, the heartwood brown,\r\nsometimes quite dark. The pores in the sapwood are open, but many of\r\nthem are closed in heartwood. The annual rings are moderately well\r\ndefined. The large pores are in the springwood, and those of the\r\nsummerwood are smaller, but numerous. The medullary rays are numerous\r\nand dark. Measured radially, they are shorter than those of many other\r\noaks. They show well in quarter-sawed lumber, but are arranged\r\npeculiarly, and do not form large groups of figures; but the wood\r\npresents a rather flecked or wavy appearance. The general tone is dark\r\nbrown and very rich. It takes a smooth polish. When the wood is worked\r\ninto spindles and small articles, and brightly polished, its appearance\r\nsuggests dark polished granite, but the similitude is not sustained\r\nunder close examination. Grills composed of small spindles and\r\nscrollwork are strikingly beautiful if displayed in light which does the\r\nwood justice. Composite panels are manufactured by joining narrow strips\r\nedge to edge. Selected pieces of dressed live oak suggest Circassian\r\nwalnut, but would not pass as an imitation on close inspection. It may\r\nbe stated generally that live oak is far from being a dead, flat wood,\r\nbut is capable of being worked for various effects. Its value as a\r\ncabinet material has not been appreciated in the past, nor have its\r\npossibilities been suspected. It dropped out of notice when shipbuilders\r\ndispensed with it, and people seem to have taken for granted that it had\r\nno value for anything else. The form of the trunks makes possible the\r\ncutting of short stock only; but there is abundance of it. It fringes a\r\nthousand miles of coast. Many a trunk, short though it is, will cut\r\neasily a thousand feet of lumber. Working the large roots in veneer has\r\nnot been undertaken, but good judges of veneers, who know what the\r\nstumps and roots contain, have expressed the opinion that a field is\r\nthere awaiting development.\r\n\r\nPublished reports of the uses of woods of various states seldom mention\r\nlive oak. In Texas some of it is employed in the manufacture of parquet\r\nflooring. It is dark and contrasts with the blocks or strips of maple or\r\nsome other light wood. It is turned in the lathe for newel posts for\r\nstairs, and contributes to other parts of stair work. In Louisiana it is\r\noccasionally found in shops where vehicles are made. It meets\r\nrequirements as axles for heavy wagons. Stone masons’ mauls are made of\r\nlive oak knots. They stand nearly as much pounding as lignum-vitæ. More\r\nlive oak is cut for fuel than for all other purposes. It develops much\r\nheat, but a large quantity of ashes remains.\r\n\r\nThe live oak is the most highly valued ornamental tree of the South,\r\nthough it has seldom been planted. Nature placed these oaks where they\r\nare growing. Many an old southern homestead sits well back in groves of\r\nlive oak. Parks and plazas in towns have them, and would not part with\r\nthem on any terms. Tallahassee, Florida, is almost buried under live\r\noaks which in earlier years sheltered the wigwams of an Indian town.\r\nVillages near the coasts of both the Gulf and the Atlantic in several\r\nsouthern states have their venerable trees large enough for half the\r\npeople to find shade beneath the branches at one time. Many fine stands\r\nhave been cut in recent years to make room for corn, cane, and rice.\r\n\r\nMany persons associate the live oak with Spanish moss which festoons its\r\nbranches in the Gulf region. The moss is no part of the tree, and\r\napparently draws no substance from it, though it may smother the leaves\r\nby accumulation, or break the branches by its weight. Strictly speaking,\r\nthe beard-like growth is not moss at all, but a sort of pine apple\r\n(_Dendropogon usenoides_) which simply hangs on the limbs and draws its\r\nsustenance from water and air. It is found on other trees, besides live\r\noak, and dealers in Louisiana alone sell half a million dollars worth of\r\nit a year to upholsterers in all the principal countries of the world.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRED OAK\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RED OAK]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRED OAK[4]\r\n\r\n(_Quercus Rubra_)\r\n\r\n    [4] Red oak belongs to the black oak group. Other species usually\r\n    listed as black oaks are Pin oak (_Quercus palustris_), Georgia oak\r\n    (_Quercus georgiana_), Texan red oak (_Quercus texana_), Scarlet oak\r\n    (_Quercus coccinea_), Yellow oak (_Quercus velutina_), California\r\n    black oak (_Quercus californica_), Turkey oak (_Quercus catesbæi_),\r\n    Spanish oak (_Quercus digitata_), Black Jack oak (_Quercus\r\n    marilandica_), Water oak (_Quercus nigra_), Willow oak (_Quercus\r\n    phellos_), Laurel oak (_Quercus laurifolia_), Blue Jack oak\r\n    (_Quercus brevifolia_), Shingle oak (_Quercus imbricaria_),\r\n    Whiteleaf oak (_Quercus hypoleuca_), Highland oak (_Quercus\r\n    wislizeni_), Myrtle oak (_Quercus myrtifolia_), California live oak\r\n    (_Quercus agrifolia_--sometimes classed with white oaks), Canyon\r\n    live oak (_Quercus chrysolepis_), an evergreen oak with no English\r\n    name, (_Quercus tomentella_), Price oak (_Quercus pricei_), Morehus\r\n    oak (_Quercus morehus_), Tanbark oak (_Quercus densiflora_), Barren\r\n    oak (_Quercus pumila_).\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen a lumberman speaks of red oak he may mean any one of a good many\r\nkinds of trees, but when a botanist or forester uses that name he means\r\none particular species and no other. For that reason there is much\r\nuncertainty as to what species is in the lumberman’s mind when he speaks\r\nof red oak. It means more to him than a single species, depending to a\r\nconsiderable extent upon the part of the country where he is doing\r\nbusiness. If he is in the Gulf states, and has in mind a tree which\r\ngrows there, he does not refer to the tree known to botanists as red\r\noak. He may mean the Texan or southern red oak (_Quercus texana_), or\r\nthe willow oak (_Quercus phellos_), or the yellow oak (_Quercus\r\nvelutina_), or any one of several others which grow in that region; but\r\nthe typical red oak does not grow farther south than the mountains of\r\nnorthern Georgia; and any one who is cutting oak south or southwest of\r\nthere, is cutting other than the true red oak. That does not imply that\r\nhe is handling something inferior, for very fine oak grows there; but in\r\nan effort to separate the commercial black oaks into respective species,\r\nit is necessary to define them by metes and bounds of ranges as well as\r\nto describe them by characteristics of leaves, acorns, and wood. The\r\ntime will probably never come in this country when the sawmill man will\r\npile each species of oak separately in his yard, and sell separately;\r\nbut the tendency is in that direction. The twenty-five or more black\r\noaks in this country all have some characteristics in common; but they\r\nare by no means all valuable alike, or all useful for the same purposes.\r\nFor that reason, the demands of trade require, and will require more and\r\nmore as higher utilization is reached, that certain kinds of red oak or\r\nblack oak be sold separately.\r\n\r\nWhat lumbermen call red oaks, speaking in the plural, botanists prefer\r\nto call black oaks. The difference is only a difference in name for the\r\nsame group of trees. The general dark color of the bark suggests the\r\nname to botanists, while the red tint of the wood appeals more to the\r\nlumberman, and he prefers the general name red oaks for the group. They\r\nmature their acorns the second year, while the trees belonging to the\r\nwhite oak group ripen theirs the first year. There are other\r\ndifferences, some of which are apparent to the casual observer, and\r\nothers are seen only by the trained eye--often aided by the\r\nmicroscope--of the dendrologist. Several of the black oaks have leaves\r\nwith sharp pointed lobes, ending in bristles. This helps to separate\r\nthem from the white oaks, but not from one another, for the true red\r\noak, the scarlet oak, the yellow oak, the pin oak, and others, have the\r\nsharp-pointed lobes on their leaves; while the willow oaks have no lobes\r\nor bristles on theirs, yet are as truly in the black oak group as any of\r\nthe others. The identification of tree species, particularly when they\r\nare as much alike as some of the oaks are, is too difficult for the\r\nlayman if he undertakes to carry it along the whole line; but it is\r\ncomparatively easy if confined to the leading woods only. An\r\nunderstanding of the geographical range of a certain tree often helps to\r\nseparate it from others. The knowledge that a tree does not grow in a\r\nparticular part of the country, is proof at once that a tree in that\r\nregion resembling it must be something else. If that principal is borne\r\nin mind it will greatly lessen mistakes in identifying trees. In\r\naccounts of the black oaks in the following pages, a careful delimiting\r\nof ranges will be attempted in the case of each.\r\n\r\nThe range of red oak extends from Nova Scotia and southern New Brunswick\r\nthrough Quebec and along the northern shore of Lake Huron, west to\r\nNebraska. It covers the Ohio valley and reaches as far south as middle\r\nTennessee. It runs south through the Atlantic states to Virginia, while\r\namong the Appalachian mountains the range is prolonged southward into\r\nnorthern Georgia. That is the tree’s extreme southern limit. It reaches\r\nits largest size in the region north of the Ohio river, and among the\r\nmountain valleys of West Virginia, and southward to Tennessee and North\r\nCarolina. It is a northern species. Toward its southern limit it meets\r\nthe northern part of the Texan red oak’s range (_Quercus texana_). There\r\nis some overlapping, and in many localities the two species grow side by\r\nside.\r\n\r\nThe red oak is known by that name in all parts of its range, but in some\r\nregions it is called black oak, and in others Spanish oak. The latter\r\nname properly belongs to another oak (_Quercus digitata_) which touches\r\nit along the southern border of its range.\r\n\r\nThe average size of red oak in the best part of its range is a little\r\nunder that of white oak, but some specimens are 150 feet high and six\r\nfeet in diameter. Heights of seventy and eighty feet are usual, and\r\ndiameters of three and four are frequent. The forest grown tree disposes\r\nof its lower limbs early in life, and develops a long, smooth trunk,\r\nwith a narrow crown. The bark on young stems and on the upper parts of\r\nlimbs of old trees is smooth and light gray. All leaves do not have the\r\nsame number of lobes, and they are sharp pointed, and fall early in\r\nautumn.\r\n\r\nThe acorns are bitter, and are regarded as poor mast. Hogs will leave\r\nthem alone if they can find white oak acorns, and squirrels will do\r\nlikewise. The best red oak timber grows from acorns, though stumps will\r\nsend up sprouts. The sprout growth may become trees of fairly large\r\nsize, but they are apt to decay at the butt. The acorn-grown tree is as\r\nfree from defects as the average forest tree. Cracks sometimes develop\r\nin the trunk, extending up and down many feet. Unless the logs are\r\ncarefully sawed, a considerable loss occurs where these cracks cross the\r\nboards. Trunks are occasionally bored by worms, as all other oaks may\r\nbe.\r\n\r\nRed oak grows rapidly. It will produce small sawlogs in the lifetime of\r\na man. It is a favorite tree for crossties, and railroads have made\r\nlarge plantings for that purpose. The ties do not last well in their\r\nnatural state, but they are easy to treat with preservatives by which\r\nseveral years are added to their period of service. It has been a\r\nfavorite tree with European planters for the past two hundred years; but\r\nthe most of the plantings beyond the sea have been for ornament in parks\r\nand private grounds.\r\n\r\nThe principal interest in red oak in this country is due to its value\r\nfor lumber. That interest is of comparatively recent date. Some red oak\r\nhas always been used for rails, clapboards, slack cooperage, and rough\r\nlumber; but while white oak was cheap and plentiful, sawmill men usually\r\nlet red oak alone. It had a poor reputation, which is now known to have\r\nbeen undeserved.\r\n\r\nRed oak is lighter than white oak, and it is generally regarded as\r\npossessing less strength and stiffness. The wide rings of annual growth,\r\nand the distinct layers of springwood and summerwood, give the basis for\r\ngood figure. To this may be added broad and regular medullary rays which\r\nare nicely brought out by quarter-sawing. The tone of the wood is red,\r\nto which fact the name red oak is due. It has large, open pores. A\r\nmagnifying glass is not required to see them in the end of a stick. It\r\nis said that smoke may be blown through a piece of red oak a foot in\r\nlength. These open pores disqualify the wood for use in tight cooperage.\r\nLiquids will leak through the pores. Statistics of sawmill output in\r\nthis country do not separate the white and black oaks, and the quantity\r\nof lumber sawed from any one species is not known. Manufacturers are\r\ndisposed to separate them. Some furniture makers use red oak exclusively\r\nfor certain purposes, and the same rule is followed by makers of other\r\ncommodities.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTEXAN RED OAK\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TEXAN RED OAK]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTEXAN RED OAK\r\n\r\n(_Quercus Texana_)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe line between red oak (_Quercus rubra_) and Texan red oak is closely\r\ndrawn by botanists, but lumbermen do not recognize much difference\r\nexcept toward the extreme ranges of each. Some call one simply red oak\r\nand the other southern red oak, but that leaves doubtful the timber on a\r\nlarge area occupied by both species. Their ranges overlap two or three\r\nhundred miles in the Ohio valley and on the southern tributaries of the\r\nOhio river in Kentucky and Tennessee. A large amount of red oak from\r\nthat region goes to market, and no one knows, and few care, whether it\r\nis of the northern or southern species. It is usually a mixture of both.\r\nBut outside of the common zone where both trees grow, the woods of the\r\ntwo are kept fairly well separate. Thirty years ago Texan red oak\r\nreceived slight recognition from botanists. When Charles S. Sargent\r\ncompiled in 1880 a volume of over 600 pages, “Forest Trees of North\r\nAmerica,” for the United States government, and which was published as\r\nvolume 9 of the Tenth Census, he did not so much as accord this tree the\r\ndignity of a species, but called it a variety of the common red oak. Its\r\nrange and its great importance were little understood at that time.\r\nSargent thus described its range: “Western Texas, valley of the Colorado\r\nriver with the species and replacing it south and west, extending to the\r\nvalley of the Neuces river and the Limpia mountains.”\r\n\r\nCompare that restricted range with that given by the same author\r\ntwenty-five years later in his “Manual of the Trees of North America.”\r\nHe gives it thus: “Northeastern Iowa and central Illinois, through\r\nsouthern Illinois and Indiana and western Kentucky and Tennessee, to the\r\nvalley of the Apalachicola river, Florida, northern Georgia, central\r\nSouth Carolina, and the coast plains of North Carolina, and through\r\nsouthern Missouri, Arkansas, and Louisiana to the mountains of western\r\nTexas; most abundant and of its largest size on the low bottom lands of\r\nthe Mississippi basin, often forming a considerable part of lowland\r\nforests; less abundant in the eastern Gulf states; in western Texas on\r\nlow limestone hills and on bottom lands in the neighborhood of streams.”\r\n\r\nThis quotation is given in full because it shows how scientific men\r\nchange their opinions to conform to new evidence. The range of that\r\nparticular species was as wide in 1880 as in 1905, but botanists had not\r\nyet worked it out. Thus knowledge increases constantly, and year by year\r\nthe resources of American forests are better understood. In this\r\ninstance, what in 1880 was supposed to be a rather insignificant\r\nvariety, occupying a restricted area in Texas, was found by 1905 to be a\r\nseparate species, covering sixteen states in whole or in part. Similar\r\nprogress concerning the forests has been made all over the country, not\r\nonly by botanists but by lumbermen. Trees which were formerly considered\r\nso nearly alike that no distinctions were made, are now recognized to be\r\nquite different.\r\n\r\nThe Texan red oak is frequently called spotted oak. The appearance of\r\nthe bark suggests the name. Large, irregular, whitish patches cover the\r\ntrunks. That peculiarity is not noticeable everywhere and on all trees,\r\nbut is common west of the Mississippi river. The tree is sometimes known\r\nas Spanish oak in the southwestern part of its range, but the name is\r\nill-advised, for the true Spanish oak (_Quercus digitata_) occurs in the\r\nsame region. The most usual name for this species, in nearly all parts\r\nof its range, is simply red oak.\r\n\r\nThe Texan red oak varies greatly in size of trees, as is natural in so\r\nwide a geographical range. Trees have been reported 200 feet high and\r\neight feet in diameter; but sizes like that are extraordinary and\r\nattempts to locate anything approaching them at this day have not been\r\nsuccessful. The average in the lower Mississippi valley is eighty or\r\nninety feet in height, and two or three in diameter. In Texas this size\r\nis seldom reached, the average not much exceeding half of it.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of Texan red oak are about half the size of those of the\r\nnorthern species. That alone will not serve to separate them, because of\r\nsuch great variation. It applies only to averages. The southern trees’\r\nleaves are from three to six inches long, two to five wide; the northern\r\nspecies bears leaves from five to nine inches long and four to six wide.\r\nThe acorns of the two species do not show so much difference in size.\r\nThe states which use Texan red oak in largest amounts are Alabama,\r\nMississippi, Louisiana, Texas, and Arkansas, though some of this wood\r\nfinds its way to northern markets where it passes as red oak without any\r\nquestions. That condition renders very difficult the task of separating\r\nthe woods. It is not so difficult further south where the true red oak\r\nis seldom seen. Shipments go north, not south. The two red oaks mingle\r\nin the lumber yards north of the Ohio river, but seldom south of the\r\nTennessee river.\r\n\r\nInvestigations made by the Forest Service of the utilization of woods in\r\nvarious states show that factories report the annual use of Texan red\r\noak as follows: Louisiana 1,777,000 feet, Mississippi 2,400,000, Texas\r\n2,814,000, Alabama 5,500,000, and Arkansas 39,301,000. This does not\r\ninclude lumber or other forest products used in the rough, or lumber\r\nshipped out of the respective states.\r\n\r\nTexan red oak is heavier than its northern relative, hard, light,\r\nreddish-brown, much of it of rapid growth, with wide, clearly defined\r\nannual rings. The medullary rays are prominent, and show well in\r\nquarter-sawing. The best of the wood is as strong as red oak, and\r\ncompares favorably with it in physical properties.\r\n\r\nOne of the most exacting uses of wood is for fixtures, such as counters\r\nin stores, bars in saloons, partitions in banks and counting rooms, and\r\nstanding desks in offices. Extra wide and long pieces are required, and\r\nthey must show satisfactory figure, and be finished to harmonize with\r\nthe interior of the room where they are placed. Texan red oak is\r\nselected by builders in many southern cities for that class of fixtures,\r\nand it meets the requirements. It is used also for interior finish and\r\nfurniture, and stair work.\r\n\r\nLike most members of the black oak group, the wood is inclined to rot\r\nquickly in damp situations, but it measures well up to the average of\r\nthe group to which it belongs. It is often employed in the South as\r\nbridge material, particularly as flooring for wagon bridges, where the\r\nwood’s hardness is its chief recommendation. Much is converted into\r\nflooring for halls, houses, and factories.\r\n\r\nThe available supply of this valuable wood in the forests of the South\r\nis not known, but there is little doubt that it exists in larger\r\nquantities than any other species of oak within its range. Perhaps in\r\ntotal quantity it exceeds red oak (_Quercus rubra_) in the whole United\r\nStates. It is quite generally distributed over an area exceeding 300,000\r\nsquare miles, and toward the western part, it is the prevailing oak. The\r\nfuture of this oak is assured. It is now cut at a rapid rate, and\r\ndoubtless the annual growth falls short of the yearly demand; but it\r\noccurs in a range so extensive that scarcity will not come for a long\r\nperiod. If the time ever comes in the South when planted timber must be\r\ndepended upon to meet the needs of the people, this oak will fill an\r\nimportant place in woodlots. It does not grow as rapidly as willow oak,\r\nbut its range is more extensive, and it possesses certain desirable\r\nproperties not found in willow oak. The acorns are rather poor mast, and\r\nthis is in the tree’s favor, for the seed will be left to grow instead\r\nof being devoured by hogs and small animals of the woods. In that\r\nrespect it has an advantage over cow oak and the other white oaks which\r\noccupy parts of its range. Their acorns are sought as food by domestic\r\nand wild animals. Texan red oak prunes itself well when it grows in\r\nclose stands, but is low and limby when it occupies open ground. The\r\ntrunks vary in form, but are inclined to enlarge at the base,\r\nparticularly when they grow in low, damp situations, as many of the best\r\ndo in the South.\r\n\r\n    GEORGIA OAK (_Quercus georgiana_) is one of the minor oaks of the\r\n    South and has not been found outside of Georgia. It grows in the\r\n    central part of the state on Stone mountain and on a few other\r\n    granite hills. Whether the species originated there and was never\r\n    able to work its way down to the more congenial valleys below, or\r\n    whether it once grew lower down and was crowded to its last retreat\r\n    by other species, is not known. But an interest attaches to it from\r\n    the very fact that its range is so restricted and that its habitat\r\n    is on the sterile summits. Lumbermen care nothing about this tree.\r\n    Few of them ever saw it or heard of it. The trunk is small, the\r\n    acorns only from one-third to half an inch long, and the leaves are\r\n    of a form midway between those of pin oak and turkey oak. The\r\n    characters of the wood have not been reported, but since there is\r\n    not enough of it to have any commercial value, the matter is not\r\n    very important.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYELLOW OAK\r\n\r\n[Illustration: YELLOW OAK]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYELLOW OAK\r\n\r\n(_Quercus Velutina_)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis tree is known as black oak in Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island,\r\nNew York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Virginia, West Virginia,\r\nNorth Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Florida, Mississippi,\r\nLouisiana, Texas, Ohio, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, Michigan,\r\nWisconsin, Minnesota and Ontario; quercitron oak in Delaware, South\r\nCarolina, Louisiana, Kansas and Minnesota; yellow oak in Rhode Island,\r\nNew York, Illinois, Texas, Kansas and Minnesota; tanbark oak in\r\nIllinois; yellow-bark oak in Minnesota and Rhode Island; spotted oak in\r\nMissouri; dyer’s oak in Texas; and yellow butt oak in Mississippi.\r\n\r\nThose who call this tree black oak have in mind the bark which is\r\nusually quite dark, though all members of this species do not present\r\nthe same appearance in that respect. Some trunks are gray, and in color\r\ndo not greatly differ from white oaks, but would hardly be mistaken for\r\nthem. Tanbark oak, a name occasionally given to this tree, is not\r\napplied in the region where chestnut oak grows, because it is much\r\ninferior to chestnut oak as tanning material. It is not only poorer in\r\ntannin, but the coloring matter associated with the inner bark is\r\ntroublesome to the tanner who is compelled to remove it or neutralize it\r\nunless he wants his leather given a yellow tone. Dyer’s oak is a name\r\nwhich refers to the value of the bark for coloring purposes. The\r\nbotanical name _velutina_ refers to the velvety texture of the inner\r\nbark.\r\n\r\nThis oak is one of the easiest to identify. The inner layer of the bark\r\nis yellow. The point of a knife easily reaches it; cutting through a\r\ndeep crack in the bark, and no mistake is possible, for no other oak has\r\nthe yellow layer of bark. The tree may be identified by leaves, flowers,\r\nand fruit, but the process is not always easy, for other members of the\r\nblack oak group bear more or less resemblance to this one.\r\n\r\nThe yellow oak’s range extends over nearly or quite a million square\r\nmiles. It exceeds the limits of most oaks in its geographical extension.\r\nIt endures severe winters and hot summers. The northern limit of its\r\nrange lies in Maine; it grows westward across southern Canada to\r\nMinnesota; it extends two hundred miles west of the Mississippi into\r\neastern Nebraska and Kansas, and follows that meridian south into Texas.\r\nIt reaches the Gulf of Mexico east of the Mississippi, and is found in\r\nmany localities in all the southern states, and along the foothills of\r\nthe Appalachian ranges. It attains its largest size in the lower Ohio\r\nvalley. The average height is seventy or eighty feet, and its diameter\r\ntwo or three feet. In some localities the trees are scrubby and produce\r\nlittle merchantable timber.\r\n\r\nThe growth rings are only moderately wide in the typical yellow oak; the\r\nring is divided nearly evenly between springwood and summerwood. The\r\nformer contains two or three rows of large, open pores. The medullary\r\nrays are fewer and smaller than those commonly found in oaks. A general\r\naverage of the properties of the wood is somewhat difficult to give,\r\nbecause of remarkable variation in trees which grow under different\r\nconditions. In some instances, where the soil is fertile and climate\r\nfavorable, the yellow oak produces a large, clear trunk, with sound\r\nwood, of good color, and equal to that of red oak; but the reverse is\r\noften the case--trunks are small and rough, wood hard and brittle, color\r\nnot satisfactory, and strength not up to standard. Sometimes first class\r\nyellow oak passes without question as good red oak in the finish and\r\nfurniture business, but that is not its usual course. Well developed\r\nwood is heavy, hard, strong, bright brown, tinged with red, with thin,\r\nlighter colored sapwood. Its weight is 43.9 pounds per cubic foot.\r\n\r\nThe uses of yellow oak follow red oak pretty closely, but are not so\r\nextensive. Figures cannot be given to show the total annual cut of\r\nyellow oak, but the output is likely much below red oak, though it is\r\nfound over a wider area, and some of it gets into the lumber yards in\r\nall regions where it grows. It is made into furniture from Maine to\r\nLouisiana. In cheaper grades of furniture, it may be the outside\r\nmaterial, but its place is usually as frame stock, to give strength, but\r\nis not visible in the finished article. An exception to this is found in\r\nchairs where yellow oak is one of several species which go regularly to\r\nthe sawmills which cut chair stock. Massachusetts snow plow makers use\r\nit, but of course it fills no such place in the South. In Mississippi,\r\nLouisiana, and Texas it is bought by manufacturers of agricultural\r\nmachinery. It is worked into cotton gins in Mississippi. Some extra fine\r\nstands of this oak occur in the Delta region of Mississippi. Frames of\r\nfreight cars are made of it in Louisiana and Texas, and warehouse and\r\ndepot floors are occasionally laid of this lumber. It is floor material\r\nin Michigan also, but that is of a better class than is required for\r\nwarehouses. It is not infrequently sold as red oak for flooring and\r\ninterior finish. Throughout the whole extent of yellow oak’s range it\r\nfinds its way to wagon shops. It is less tough than white oak, but in\r\nmany places, such as bolsters, sandboards, and hounds, it serves as\r\nwell. Warehouse trucks and push cars are of this wood in many instances.\r\n\r\nSlack coopers convert this wood into their wares in many regions. The\r\npores are too open to permit its use as tight cooperage, where liquids\r\nare to be contained, but for barrels and kegs of many kinds, as well as\r\nfor boxes, baskets, and crates, it meets all requirements. It is good\r\nfuel. Many burners of brick and pottery show it preference, and charcoal\r\nburners make a clean sweep of it when it occurs in the course of their\r\noperations; though when it is desirable to save the by-products of\r\ncharcoal kilns or retorts, yellow oak is considered less valuable than\r\nbirch, beech, and maple.\r\n\r\nThe bark of this tree is employed less now than formerly for dyeing\r\npurposes. Aniline dyes have taken its place. In pioneer times the bark\r\nwas one of the best coloring materials the people had, and every family\r\nlooked after its own supply as carefully as it provided sassafras bark\r\nfor tea, slippery elm bark for poultices, and witch hazel for gargles.\r\nThe oak bark was peeled, dried, and pounded to a powder. The mass was\r\nsifted, and the yellow particles, being finer than the black bark,\r\npassed through the screen, and were set apart for the dye kettle, while\r\nthe screenings were rejected. Various arts and sciences were called into\r\nrequisition to add to or take from the natural color which the bark gave\r\nthe cloth. Salts of iron were commonly employed to modify the deepness\r\nof the yellow.\r\n\r\nThe acorns of this oak are bitter, and escape the mast hunters. Old\r\nstumps have little need to send up sprouts, for acorns keep the species\r\nalive. Yellow oaks are in no immediate danger of extermination. Nature\r\nplants generously, and the tree can get along on poor soil where the\r\nfarm hunter is not apt to molest it. It has a fairly thick bark, and is\r\nable to take care of itself in a moderate fire, except when the\r\nseedlings are quite small. The young tree’s tap root is much developed,\r\nand goes deep for moisture, and the growing sapling flourishes on ground\r\nwhere some other species would suffer for water.\r\n\r\n    WHITELEAF OAK (_Quercus hypoleuca_). The beauty of this small\r\n    evergreen oak of the mountains of western Texas, New Mexico, and\r\n    Arizona, is in its foliage rather than its wood. Large trunks--that\r\n    is, those twenty inches or more in diameter--are apt to be hollow,\r\n    but the sound wood is employed in repairing wagons in local shops,\r\n    and in rough ranch timbers. Its importance will never extend beyond\r\n    the region where it grows, but in that region it will continue to be\r\n    used where nothing better can be obtained. The largest trees are\r\n    sixty feet high, and two in diameter, but few reach those\r\n    dimensions. It is an arid land oak. It grows at from 4,000 to 6,000\r\n    feet elevations on mountains and plateaus. The leaves remain\r\n    thirteen months on the twigs. They are of the willow form, ranging\r\n    from two to four inches in length and one-half to one in width. The\r\n    acorns are small and bitter. The strength of this oak is remarkable,\r\n    if it may be judged by the figures given by Sargent. Two samples of\r\n    wood procured by himself and Dr. Engelmann on a dry, gravelly ground\r\n    among the Santa Rita mountains in Arizona, showed breaking strength\r\n    sixty-one per cent greater than the average given by the same author\r\n    for white oak. The stiffness of the specimens was a little above\r\n    white oak, and the weight three pounds more per cubic foot. It\r\n    should be borne in mind, however, that results derived from a test\r\n    of only two samples are not a safe basis for concluding that the\r\n    wood generally will average of so great strength. The annual rings\r\n    of growth are not clearly marked. The wood is porous, but the pores\r\n    are not generally arranged in bands, although they occasionally\r\n    follow that arrangement. The medullary rays are broad and abundant,\r\n    but are rather short, measured along the radial lines. They are of\r\n    pink color, a characteristic not unusual with oaks in semi-arid\r\n    regions. The foliage is doubtless the most valuable characteristic\r\n    of whiteleaf oak. The leaves are silver white below, and dark green\r\n    above. When they are agitated by wind the flashing of the different\r\n    tones and tints in the sunshine presents an attractive picture. It\r\n    belongs to the willow oak branch of the red oak group, and bears\r\n    two-year acorns.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCARLET OAK\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SCARLET OAK]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCARLET OAK\r\n\r\n(_Quercus Coccinea_)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe name of scarlet oak is in use in Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode\r\nIsland, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, North\r\nCarolina, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Michigan,\r\nNebraska, Iowa, and Ontario; red oak is the name in North Carolina,\r\nAlabama, Wisconsin, Nebraska, and Minnesota; black oak in Nebraska,\r\nIllinois, Iowa, and Wisconsin, and Spanish oak in North Carolina.\r\n\r\nThe name is descriptive of the autumn leaves. Artists dispute among\r\nthemselves whether the leaves are scarlet, red, or crimson. In their\r\nopinion a good deal of difference exists between these colors, rendering\r\nit quite incorrect to give one color the name of another. As for the\r\nartists, they are probably correct in their analysis of colors, but the\r\ngeneral public knows the tree as scarlet oak, and it will doubtless be\r\ncalled by that name by most people who speak of the tree in the woods,\r\nwhile those who refer to the wood after it is sawed will speak of it as\r\nred oak.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of scarlet oak are rather persistent, and remain on the twigs\r\nlate in the season. The brilliancy of this tree is rendered doubly\r\nconspicuous, when it is contrasted with the surrounding sombre, winter\r\ncolors.\r\n\r\nIn appearance the tree is striking for its delicacy of foliage and\r\ntwigs. The crown is always narrow and open, and in forest growth is\r\ncompressed. The height, in good specimens, is about one hundred feet,\r\nbut it often exceeds that size. In diameter it grows as large as four\r\nfeet. The mature bark is dark in color and broken into broad, smooth\r\nridges and plates, edged with red. It shows a reddish inner bark when\r\ncut and this may be relied upon to identify the tree. The leaves are\r\nfour or five inches long; deeply sinused, three or four on a side; long,\r\nbristle-toothed lobes, broad at the base; acorns bitter, mature in two\r\nyears; sessile, brown; cup closely drawn in at the edge.\r\n\r\nIts range comprises the northeastern quarter of the United States.\r\nBeginning in southern Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont, it grows through\r\nmiddle New York, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Iowa to eastern Nebraska.\r\nSouthward it extends along the coast through Virginia and inland along\r\nthe mountains to South Carolina and Georgia. The growth is abundant over\r\nmost of the range, the favorite habitat being dry, gravelly uplands. It\r\nseems to be most abundant along the northern part of the Atlantic coast\r\nfrom Massachusetts to New Jersey, and is less common in the interior,\r\nand on the prairies skirting the western margins of the eastern forests.\r\nThe average size of the tree is from seventy to eighty feet high and two\r\nor three in diameter. In many regions it is much smaller, while no very\r\nlarge trees have been reported.\r\n\r\nThe wood is heavy, strong, hard; the layers of annual growth are\r\nstrongly marked by several rows of large, open ducts; the summerwood is\r\ndense and occupies half the yearly ring; the medullary rays are much\r\nlike those of red oak, though scarcely as broad. They run in straight\r\nlines radially, and show well in quarter-sawing. The color of the wood\r\nis light brown or red, the thin sapwood rather darker.\r\n\r\nThis wood is practically of the same weight as white oak; but it is\r\nrated considerably stronger and stiffer. A number of writers have listed\r\nscarlet oak low in fuel value. Theoretically, the fuel values of woods\r\nare proportionate to their weights, except that resinous woods must be\r\ncompared with resinous, and non-resinous with non-resinous. In practice,\r\nhowever, every fireman who feeds a furnace with wood knows that\r\ndifferent woods develop different degrees of heat, though they may weigh\r\nthe same. Results are modified by various circumstances and conditions,\r\nand for that reason theory and practice are often far apart in\r\ndetermining how much heat a given quantity of wood is good for.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to procure exact information regarding the uses of\r\nscarlet oak. It never goes to market under its own name. An examination\r\nof wood-using reports from a dozen states within scarlet oak’s range\r\ndoes not reveal a single mention of this wood for any purpose. It is\r\ncertain, nevertheless, that much goes to market and that it has many\r\nimportant uses. It loses its identity and is bought and sold as red oak.\r\nUnder the name of that wood it is manufactured into furniture, finish,\r\nagricultural implements, cars, boats, wagons and other vehicles, and\r\nmany other articles. One of the most important markets for scarlet oak\r\nis in chair factories. Its grain is attractive enough to give it place\r\nas outside material, and its strength fits it for frames and other parts\r\nwhich must bear strain. Chair stock mills which clean up woodlots and\r\npatches of forest where scarlet oak grows in mixture with other species\r\nof oak, take all that comes, without being particular as to the exact\r\nkind of oak. Slack coopers follow much the same course. A wood strong\r\nenough to meet requirements, is generally acceptable. Scarlet oak is\r\nusually considered unsuitable for tight cooperage, on account of the\r\nlarge open pores of the wood, which permit leakage of liquids. It meets\r\nconsiderable demand in the manufacture of boxes and crates, particularly\r\nthe latter.\r\n\r\nThe size and quality of logs which a tree may furnish to a sawmill is no\r\nmeasure of its full value. Scarlet oak is far better known as an\r\nornamental tree than for its wood. It has been planted in this country\r\nand in Europe. Its brilliant foliage is greatly admired. No other oak\r\nequals it, and it compares favorably with sugar maple, black gum, and\r\ndogwood. It is an ornament to parks and private grounds, though the\r\nbrilliancy of its foliage is seldom exhibited to as good advantage in\r\ncultivation as in the native forest where contrasts are more numerous,\r\nand nature does its work unhindered by man. The scarlet oak is not a\r\nrapid grower, and the form of the tree is not perfectly symmetrical. The\r\nspring leaves are red, the summer foliage bright, rich green, the autumn\r\nscarlet--a variety not equalled by many forest trees.\r\n\r\nWILLOW OAK (_Quercus phellos_) is named for its leaves which look like\r\nthose of willow. There is a group of such oaks with leaves similar, and\r\nthey are known collectively as willow oaks. The one here described may\r\nbe considered typical of the group.\r\n\r\nThis oak is apt to present rather a surprising appearance to those who\r\nhave seen nothing but those oaks whose leaves are lobed or cleft. It\r\nbelongs to the red oaks. Like others of this division it has a tendency\r\nto hybridize, several varieties being known. Willow oak is a denizen of\r\nthe southern Atlantic and southeastern states and favors rich, moist\r\nsoil, either on uplands or on bottoms, along the margins of streams or\r\nswamps. It does not go inland as far as the foothills of the ranges and\r\nis found most abundantly in the basin of the lower Mississippi.\r\nBeginning in New York, the range extends southward into Florida, along\r\nthe Gulf states, touching Texas, up through Arkansas, touching Missouri\r\nand Kentucky, down through western Tennessee and southern Georgia\r\nrounding the southern end of the Appalachians.\r\n\r\nYoung trees have a slender delicate pendant appearance of twigs and\r\nfoliage more typical of the willow than of oak; but in time they become\r\nmore rugged, although the branching and foliage are always more delicate\r\nthan is usual with oaks. The tree attains a height of eighty feet and a\r\ndiameter up to four feet, but usually is about half of this. It is\r\nclothed in a smooth, brown bark, ridged only in older trees. The leaves\r\nare about five inches long and narrow in proportion, are of shiny,\r\nleathery texture, dark above and pale below. The acorns are on short\r\nstalks, solitary or in pairs, and ripen in two years, are short and\r\nrounded and in shallow cups.\r\n\r\nThe weight of willow oak is approximately the same as white oak. It is\r\nslightly stronger but less elastic. Its annual rings contain broad bands\r\nof small open ducts parallel to the thin, dark, medullary rays. The wood\r\nis reddish-brown in color, the thick sapwood darker brown. The fuel\r\nvalue is rated the same as white oak, but the wood contains more ash.\r\n\r\nWillow oak is much used in the South, but usually under the name red\r\noak. Lumbermen seldom speak of it as willow oak. The species is as\r\nhighly developed in Louisiana as anywhere else, and the uses found for\r\nthe wood in that state will probably be found for it wherever the tree\r\ngrows in commercial quantities. A report on the manufacture of wooden\r\ncommodities in Louisiana, published in 1912, listed the following uses\r\nfor willow oak: Agricultural implements, balustrades, bar tops,\r\nbedsteads, bottoms for wagon beds, bridge approaches and floors, chairs,\r\nchurch pews, cot frames, doors, floors, frames, interior finish,\r\nmolding, newel posts, pulpits, railing, screens, slack cooperage,\r\nstairwork, store fixtures, wagon axles, and other vehicle parts.\r\n\r\nThese uses coincide nearly with those of red oak, and indicate the\r\nimportant position occupied by willow oak in the country’s industries.\r\nThose who handle the wood complain that its seasoning qualities are\r\npoor, and that care is necessary to bring satisfactory results. It works\r\nnicely and stands well after the seasoning is accomplished.\r\n\r\nWillow oak grows rapidly. It is doubtful if any oak in this country\r\nsurpasses it. It wants damp, rich soil and a warm climate, to do its\r\nbest. Some of the bottom lands in the lower Mississippi valley have\r\nproduced splendid stands of willow oak, the trunks being tall and clear\r\nof limbs, and the wood sound.\r\n\r\nThe willow oak is much planted for ornamental purposes in the southern\r\nstates. It manages to keep alive when planted as far north as\r\nMassachusetts, but the grace of its form is not fully developed much\r\nnorth of the Potomac river. It is a common street tree in the South, and\r\nits airy foliage forms a pleasing contrast with the heavy, dark-green of\r\nthe magnolia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTURKEY OAK\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TURKEY OAK]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTURKEY OAK\r\n\r\n(_Quercus Catesbæi_)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe claim that this tree is called turkey oak because turkeys feed on\r\nthe acorns, is not well founded. In common with nearly all members of\r\nthe black oak group, to which this species belongs, the acorns of turkey\r\noak are bitter, and unless animals are pressed by hunger they do not eat\r\nthem. It is evident that the shape of the leaves gives this tree its\r\nname. They bear considerable resemblance to the foot of a turkey. There\r\nis at least enough similitude to suggest the name, and it is not\r\ninappropriate. Many people now use the term without thinking of its\r\norigin, and if asked their opinion say that fondness of turkeys for the\r\nacorns led to the name.\r\n\r\nThe tree has other names in different regions. In North Carolina, South\r\nCarolina, Mississippi, and Florida it is known as scrub oak. The name\r\nfits it well in certain places, for when it grows on poor soil and in\r\nadversity, it degenerates into a low, straggling thicket, frequently not\r\ntrees at all, but shrubs. It is called black jack in South Carolina but\r\nthe name belongs to another species (_Quercus marilandica_). In the same\r\nstate it is known as barren scrub oak, because it is very small and is\r\nfound on poor lands popularly known as barrens. Some call it forked-leaf\r\nblack jack, but the name is usually shorter, and forked-leaf, or\r\nforked-leaf oak, is a name well understood among lumbermen, and the\r\npeople generally over much of the tree’s range. Some of the leaves show\r\nclearly-defined three forks, the middle one longer than the others; but\r\nin other leaves, often from the same tree, the forks are not so\r\nregularly outlined. This tree, like many other oaks, exhibits\r\nconsiderable variation in the forms of leaves.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing peculiar in the form and appearance of the acorns. They\r\naverage about one inch long and three-quarters of an inch wide, and sit\r\nin shallow cups. They mature the second year. The bark of old trees is\r\nblack near the ground, rather rough, and an inch or more thick.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to name an average size for turkey oak. The largest\r\ntrunks are three or four feet in diameter and eighty feet high, but the\r\ntrees cut for sawlogs are only fifty or sixty feet high and two in\r\ndiameter, in most of the regions. As previously stated, much of the\r\nstand is stunted and some of it is only brush. All sizes are found, from\r\nlarge, first rate trunks down to shrubs. Large trees which grow in\r\nforests, prune themselves well and their trunks compare favorably with\r\nred oaks.\r\n\r\nThe tree’s range has its northeastern limit in North Carolina, and\r\nextends to Peace Creek, Florida. It is found westward to Louisiana where\r\nfair-sized timber grows, but in small quantities. It is usually\r\nconsidered that its best development is in South Carolina and Georgia,\r\nbut good trees are likely to be found in any part of its range. It is\r\ndistinctly a tree of the South. It was named by Michaux, the well-known\r\nFrench botanist who visited the southern states early in the nineteenth\r\ncentury, and he named it in honor of Mark Catesby who explored the\r\nregion much earlier and wrote concerning its trees and other natural\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nTurkey oak is one of the little-known trees of the South, as far as\r\nlumbermen are concerned. They know it well enough in the woods, but not\r\nat sawmills. When cut into logs it ceases to be turkey oak and becomes\r\nred oak, and under that name it goes to the lumber yard, and later to\r\nmarket. Users of red oak lumber do not object to the occasional piece of\r\nturkey oak mixed with it--if they ever find it out, which few of them\r\ndo. Nevertheless, the consensus of opinion among sawmill men is that\r\nturkey oak ought to rate below red oak.\r\n\r\nTests of the wood to determine its character and qualities do not\r\njustify so low an estimate of turkey oak. Sargent found it stronger and\r\nmore elastic than white oak, while a little lighter in weight. It is\r\nnearly equal to white oak in fuel value. It is hard, compact, and the\r\nrings of annual growth are marked by several rows of large, open ducts.\r\nThe medullary rays are broad and conspicuous. The color is light brown,\r\ntinged with red, the sapwood somewhat lighter.\r\n\r\nA special investigation of the uses of turkey oak in one of the southern\r\nstates brought out the fact that it meets requirements well and fills a\r\nplace in several wood-using industries in that region. Vehicle makers\r\nfind it satisfactory in a number of places. It is made into bottoms of\r\nwagon beds, felloes, bolsters, axles, hubs, hounds, tongues, spokes,\r\nstandards, sandboards, and reaches. These constitute nearly all parts of\r\nheavy vehicles. The wood is made into telegraph brackets, but apparently\r\nnot in large quantities. Car builders employ it for frames and floors.\r\nIt is made into ordinary matched flooring and goes in with other oaks.\r\nIt is used as a general furniture wood, both as outside material, and\r\ninside frames. It may be quarter-sawed to advantage. It is employed also\r\nas interior finish, which demands lumber of practically the same grades\r\nas go into furniture. Mantels of this wood compare favorably with those\r\nof red oak. Chair makers cut stock from turkey oak. It is not abundant\r\nanywhere, otherwise it would be of much importance.\r\n\r\nThe forests of the United States contain so many valuable oaks that a\r\nscarce and geographically restricted species like turkey oak cannot be\r\nexpected to attract much attention in the future. Nevertheless, it is a\r\nstrong, interesting tree. It takes advantage of every opportunity to\r\ndevelop. When an acorn germinates in good soil, and receives sufficient\r\nlight and moisture, it produces a merchantable tree; but in poor soil\r\nand under unfavorable circumstances it becomes a stunted bush only.\r\nWoodlots of turkey oak planted in fertile land would probably do as well\r\nas most of the southern red oaks under like conditions. The tree is not\r\napt to get justice, because of the prejudice against it.\r\n\r\nCALIFORNIA BLACK OAK (_Quercus californica_) ranges from central Oregon\r\nsouthward through the coast region of California nearly to the Mexican\r\nboundary. It occurs also on the western slope of the Sierra Nevadas in\r\nCalifornia. It is not found on the plains or near the sea, but occurs on\r\nmountain slopes, low summits, elevated valleys, and in canyons. In the\r\nNorth, it ranges from 1,500 to 3,000 feet and in the South it ascends to\r\n9,000 feet. This far western oak bears more resemblance to the yellow\r\noak (_Quercus velutina_) of the East than to any other. Trees have been\r\nreported 100 feet high and four in diameter, but they are scarce.\r\nSeventy-five feet high and two or three feet in diameter are usual\r\ndimensions of mature timber. The trees are inclined to be angular in the\r\noutlines of their crowns. The leaves fall in autumn, but the acorns\r\npersist two years. They sit deep in their rough cups. The trunk is\r\nhabitually crooked. It leans out of plumb, and lacks the nicely balanced\r\npoise which adds to the attractiveness of some oaks. The large boles are\r\nusually hollow, dead at the tops, or otherwise defective. That condition\r\nis apparently due to old age. Trees stand long after they pass maturity\r\nand start on their decline. They die by inches, and not infrequently\r\nthey decay and crumble by piecemeal both at the bottom and at the top.\r\nAt best the trunk of this oak is of poor form for saw timber. It divides\r\ninto large limbs ten or twenty feet from the ground. It is of slow\r\ngrowth, and it reaches old age--possibly as much as 350 years in extreme\r\ncases. The wood is very porous, but the pores are not in rows. The\r\nmedullary rays are thin and distinct. It is not known that any\r\nquarter-sawing has been attempted, and it would hardly be profitable.\r\nThe wood is pale red, exceedingly brittle, firm, light for oak, and it\r\nhas a distinct odor of tannin with which both the wood and the bark are\r\nheavily charged. The principal uses to which this oak is put in\r\nCalifornia and Oregon are as fuel and ranch timbers, the latter being of\r\nthe simplest and roughest sort. Its fuel value is high, compared with\r\nother woods of the region. Some use was made of the bark for tanning\r\npurposes years ago on the Pacific slope, but it does not appear to go to\r\nmarket now.\r\n\r\n    BLUE JACK OAK (_Quercus brevifolia_) bears several names, upland\r\n    willow oak, to distinguish it from other willow oaks which grow in\r\n    swamps, sand jack, referring to the land on which it grows,\r\n    high-ground willow oak, turkey oak, shin oak and cinnamon oak. No\r\n    reason is known for the last name which is not used outside of\r\n    Florida. The tree grows in a narrow strip along the coast from North\r\n    Carolina to Texas, crossing northern Florida. The blue jack oak\r\n    sometimes attains a height of fifty feet and a diameter of twenty\r\n    inches; but that is its best. It is usually fifteen or twenty feet\r\n    high and a few inches in diameter. The leaves are from two to five\r\n    inches long and quite narrow, closely resembling those of willow.\r\n    The acorns are abundant, but small. The tree is of so little value\r\n    that it does not interest the lumberman. It occupies waste land, and\r\n    may produce a little fuel without crowding more valuable trees, but\r\n    is in every way inferior to the black jack oak (_Quercus\r\n    marilandica_), which overlaps its range a little, but is a northern\r\n    species. The wood of blue jack oak is hard, strong, light brown in\r\n    color, with darker-colored sapwood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPANISH OAK\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SPANISH OAK]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPANISH OAK\r\n\r\n(_Quercus Digitata_)\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the first difficulties in an attempt to clear up the\r\nmisunderstandings regarding Spanish oak is to confine the name to the\r\nspecies to which it belongs. That is no easy task, because the name has\r\nbeen applied to numerous oaks in various parts of the country, and\r\nwithout any apparent reason. Some of these bear little resemblance to\r\nSpanish oak and grow almost wholly outside its range. It is not a case\r\nof mistaking one for the other, for there is no mistake. Some speak of\r\nthe common red oak as Spanish oak, others bestow that name on yellow\r\noak, others on black jack oak, or scarlet oak, or any one of several\r\nothers. It appears, however, that the name is not applied to any member\r\nof the white oak group.\r\n\r\nIt is said that Spanish oak and Norway pine were named by the same\r\nprocess. Each got its name because it was supposed to be similar to a\r\nspecies in the old country--the pine like an evergreen of north Europe,\r\nand the oak like a broadleaf tree of Spain. It was learned later that\r\nboth the American species were different from those of Europe which they\r\nresembled.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar drooping foliage of Spanish oak gives the tree a character\r\nwhich impresses a person who sees the full-leafed crown for the first\r\ntime. The leaves are six or seven inches long and four or five wide.\r\nTheir forms vary within wide limits, and their shapes change from week\r\nto week while growing. Some have no lobes or sinuses, others have them\r\nin rudimentary form only, while in still others they are well developed.\r\n\r\nThe tree is often called red oak, particularly by lumbermen who cut it\r\nand send it to market with red oak. In Louisiana it is known as Spanish\r\nwater oak, there being much resemblance between it and water oak\r\n(_Quercus nigra_) with which it is associated. Its range covers more\r\nthan 200,000 square miles, beginning at the north in New Jersey and\r\nfollowing down the coast regions to central Florida. It extends westward\r\ninto Texas to the valley of the Brazos river; northward to Missouri and\r\nsouthern Indiana and Illinois. It does not grow far inland from the\r\ncoast in the north Atlantic states, but further south it is common on\r\nthe coast plain between the sea and the base of the mountains. It is\r\noften found on dry sand hills in that region. The largest Spanish oaks\r\non record grew in the lower Ohio valley, particularly along the Wabash\r\nriver. It is usually of medium size and large trunks are seldom seen.\r\nThe average height is seventy or eighty feet, diameter two or three. In\r\nthe open, the crown is broad and low, but in forests the trunk prunes\r\nitself fairly well, and makes good saw timber, as far as form and size\r\nare concerned. The acorns ripen in two years, and are bitter. The bark\r\nis rich in tannin, but tanneries do not use much of it.\r\n\r\nThe tree is not generally abundant. Some large areas within its range\r\nhave little, and thick stands are unusual anywhere. It is one of the\r\noaks which lumbermen neither reject nor seek. They cut it in course of\r\noperations, and saw it and sell it under the common name, red oak.\r\n\r\nThe wood is heavy, very hard, and strong. It is reputed to decay more\r\nrapidly than most oaks, and it checks badly in seasoning. The annual\r\nrings of growth are broad, and the springwood is marked by several rows\r\nof large open pores. The medullary rays are few but conspicuous; color\r\nlight red, the sapwood lighter. The wood weighs about three pounds less\r\nthan white oak per cubic foot, and its fuel value is less.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to compile an account of the uses of Spanish oak by the\r\nvarious industries of this country, for the reason that other oaks pass\r\nby its name and it is known by names which should not be applied to it.\r\nIt is shown, however, where special studies of its utilization have been\r\nmade that it is a useful wood for many purposes. It is a useful\r\nfurniture material, and though statistics do not give separate figures\r\nfor it, evidently the total quantity consumed yearly runs into many\r\nmillions of feet. It is much employed in the manufacture of tables,\r\nchiefly for frames, but occasionally as the outside material. It may be\r\nquarter-sawed, if good logs are selected. The chair factories in North\r\nCarolina use about 44,000,000 feet of oak yearly, and Spanish oak\r\nsupplies a rather large share of the material. It is employed as\r\ninterior finish in that state, and also for mission furniture, brackets\r\nfor telegraph and telephone poles, refrigerators, and kitchen safes.\r\nSlack coopers and manufacturers of boxes and crates find the wood\r\nsuitable for their wares; but its open pores stand in the way of its use\r\nfor tight cooperage.\r\n\r\nSimilar uses of the wood occur in Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas, and\r\nit may be assumed that they occur also in all other portions of Spanish\r\noak’s range. It goes to wagon shops in Texas where it is substituted for\r\nred oak. It is employed also in the manufacture of rice hullers and\r\ncotton gins. Lumbermen in northern Louisiana use log trucks with axles,\r\nfelloes, and other heavy parts of Spanish oak, and it is frequently\r\npreferred for stone wagons.\r\n\r\nIn practically all large shipments of southern red oak to the North,\r\nsome Spanish oak is mixed. It could not be otherwise, since this wood is\r\ncut in the forest with other red oaks, is sawed and stocked with them,\r\nand goes with them to market.\r\n\r\nBLACK JACK OAK (_Quercus marilandica_) is one of the scrub trees of this\r\ncountry, and few good words are ever heard for it; yet it has redeeming\r\nqualities. Lumbermen have not paid much attention to it and never will,\r\nfor only when at its best is the trunk large enough for any kind of\r\nsawlog, and there has been little inclination to use it for anything\r\nelse. It attains size fitting it for fence posts, and sometimes it\r\nperforms service along that line; but the small trunks are nearly all\r\nsapwood, and decay strikes them quickly. The bark is black, hence the\r\nname, and it is exceedingly rough, and is broken in squares. The leaves\r\nare large and pear-shaped, with the broad end opposite the stem. Some\r\nare slightly lobed. A vigorous black jack oak, standing in open ground,\r\npresents a fine appearance. The crown is wide and is frequently conical,\r\nthe limbs small, and are set in the trunk on nearly horizontal lines.\r\nThe range of this unloved species covers 600,000 or more square miles,\r\nbeginning in New York, running west to central Nebraska, south through\r\nTexas nearly to the Rio Grande, and in Florida to Tampa. It is not an\r\naggressive tree and has permitted itself to be crowded off the good land\r\nuntil it has formed the habit of occupying geographical left-overs in\r\nthe form of sand banks and wornout fields. In the northeastern part of\r\nits range it is often associated with scrub pine (_Pinus virginiana_),\r\nbecause the two have similar habits and are content to live in perpetual\r\npoverty on dry gravel or thin sand. Large trunks are not possible under\r\nsuch circumstances, and first-class wood is unusual. Black jack oak at\r\nits best may attain a height of fifty feet and a diameter of eighteen\r\ninches, but it is oftener twenty feet high and six inches through. It\r\ngrows with moderate rapidity and does not live long.\r\n\r\nThe annual rings are often indistinct. The wood is hard, heavy, and\r\nstrong, and checks badly in seasoning. The medullary rays are broad and\r\nconspicuous, the wood dark brown in color, the sapwood lighter. This oak\r\nis very high in ash contents, more than one per cent of the dry weight\r\nof wood going to ashes when burned. The tree reaches its best\r\ndevelopment in the lower Mississippi valley, and in eastern Texas.\r\nComparatively few uses for it have been found. Cordwood cutters find it\r\nvaluable where it abounds in sufficient quantity, and it has been burned\r\nfor charcoal for iron foundries and blacksmith shops. Small amounts are\r\noccasionally found in wood-using factories in Texas, but only when logs\r\nwith considerable heartwood can be procured. The sap is characterless\r\nand seems to be utterly rejected at the factory. Sometimes the rich\r\nbrown of the heartwood is attractive, but more frequently the wood is\r\nringed and splotched with different colors, not distributed in a way to\r\ngive any artistic effect. When a satisfactory stick is found, it can be\r\nworked into balusters and small spindles which show grain well. It is\r\nalso worked into broad panels made up of narrow, quarter-sawed strips,\r\nwhich exhibit the dark flecks of the wood to good advantage.\r\n\r\n    TRIDENT OAK (_Quercus tridentata_) is remarkable for its extreme\r\n    scarcity, and is of no commercial importance. It was formerly found\r\n    in Missouri--a single tree--which was afterwards destroyed. It\r\n    occurs in Washtenaw county, Michigan. It appears that no report\r\n    showing the character of the wood has been made.\r\n\r\n    LEA OAK (_Quercus leana_), which is believed to be a hybrid between\r\n    yellow oak (_Quercus velutina_) and shingle oak (_Quercus\r\n    imbricaria_), is interesting but not important. Trees are apt to\r\n    stand alone, and far apart. They occur from District of Columbia to\r\n    Missouri, and south to North Carolina. The range is imperfectly\r\n    known.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLAUREL OAK\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LAUREL OAK]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLAUREL OAK\r\n\r\n(_Quercus Laurifolia_)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis representative of the black oak group is found nowhere except in\r\nthe southeastern states, and only in their borders. It never ranges far\r\ninland, but sticks to wet localities and the margins of swamps where its\r\nassociates are tupelo, southern white cedar, cypress, magnolias, and,\r\nnear its southern limit, myrtle and other semi-tropical trees and\r\nshrubs. It is sometimes utilized as an ornament, but that is not its\r\nusual function. It is not a successful competitor as a shade tree with\r\nwillow oak and water oak.\r\n\r\nBeginning at the border of the Dismal Swamp in Virginia as the northern\r\nlimit of growth, this interesting tree ranges southward along the coast\r\nto Cape Romano in Florida and westward in the lower Gulf states to\r\nsoutheastern Louisiana. It is seen at its best in eastern Florida. It\r\nputs forth a vigorous growth on the hummock land in the southern part of\r\nthat state, where it develops a shapely trunk when in crowded stands. It\r\ngrows well in very rocky ground.\r\n\r\nAlthough the common name laurel oak is prompted by its foliage, the tree\r\nbears various other sectional names. It is known as laurel oak in North\r\nCarolina, South Carolina, Alabama, and Florida; Darlington oak in South\r\nCarolina; willow oak in Florida and South Carolina; water oak in\r\nGeorgia. The latter name has a tendency to confuse it with another\r\nspecies which is properly called water oak (_Quercus nigra_).\r\n\r\nThe ornamental qualities of this tree are due to the tall stately bole,\r\nits shapely and symmetrical round-topped head and slender branches and\r\ntwigs. It sometimes attains the dignity of one hundred feet in height\r\nwith a proportionate diameter of three or four feet. The bark is firm,\r\nof dark, reddish-brown color, and usually is not fissured but finely\r\nbroken into small close, scale-like plates. On old trees, especially at\r\nthe butt, deep fissures divide it into broad ridges. The buds are shiny\r\nbrown, and they narrow abruptly to an acute point. The acorns are either\r\nsessile or have short stalks, and they usually grow alone. They are\r\nshort and broad, and are incased in shallow, thin cups. In the flowering\r\nseason hairy aments add to the attractiveness of the tree. The leaves\r\nare dark green above and lighter on the lower surface and are grouped\r\nrather closely on the twigs. They attain a length of four inches or\r\nless, and fall gradually after turning yellow.\r\n\r\nLaurel oak seems to be little used. It is occasionally referred to as\r\nrather inferior to other members of the black oak group, but it is not\r\napparent why it bears that reputation. It may be on account of its poor\r\nseasoning qualities. Like other southern oaks, it is very heavy when\r\ngreen, and it is inclined to shrink and warp while in the process of\r\nparting with its moisture. If this can be successfully overcome, the\r\nwood ought to be valuable. Tests made on four samples cut on St. John’s\r\nriver, Florida, recorded in Sargent’s tables, show remarkable results.\r\nThe wood is 34 per cent stronger and 37 per cent stiffer than white oak,\r\nand is only one pound heavier per cubic foot of dry wood. If these\r\nvalues are fairly representative of the wood of laurel oak, it should be\r\nexceptionally valuable in vehicle making. It would fall considerably\r\nbelow hickory, but would stand very high among other woods, and could be\r\nrecommended for wagon axles, tongues, and other parts of heavy vehicles.\r\n\r\nIt should be borne in mind, however, that tests alone, and particularly\r\nwhen the number of samples is small, are not sufficient to decide a\r\nwood’s place as a manufacturing material. It must be tried in actual\r\npractice, and that has not yet been done in the case of laurel oak as a\r\nwagon wood. When tried out it may exhibit defects, or undesirable\r\nqualities, which are not apparent in samples employed in laboratory\r\ntests.\r\n\r\nThere is little exact information available in regard to the supply of\r\nlaurel oak in the South. It is not abundant in the sense that willow oak\r\nand Texan red oak are. Neither are the trees generally of good form for\r\nlumber. Little has ever been cut, because the land where it grows is not\r\ndemanded for agriculture. It occupies out-of-the-way places, and the\r\nhunter and fisherman are better acquainted with it than the lumberman.\r\n\r\nHIGHLAND OAK (_Quercus wislizeni_) is a California evergreen with leaves\r\ncommonly shaped like holly, but sometimes their edges are smooth with no\r\nsign of teeth. The foliage remains longer on this tree than is usual\r\nwith evergreen oaks. Old leaves generally fall within a month after the\r\nnew crop appears; but those of highland oak remain several months\r\nlonger, gradually falling during the second summer. When the tree is at\r\nits best it is a splendid representative of the vegetable kingdom. Its\r\nform does not please lumbermen, for the trunk is short and rough; but\r\nthe crown rises seventy or eighty feet, is symmetrical, the foliage dark\r\ngreen, and the general appearance is that of an enormous holly tree.\r\nTrunks are sometimes five or six feet in diameter. The name highland oak\r\nis somewhat misleading, though the species ascends to an altitude of\r\n6,000 feet or more. It is described as a highland tree to distinguish it\r\nfrom the California live oak (_Quercus agrifolia_) which grows in the\r\nvicinity of the sea in California. The highland oak ranges from northern\r\nCalifornia to the international boundary, following the foothills of the\r\nmountain ranges. It occurs in dry river bottoms and washes and in\r\ndesert mountain canyons. It is not choice as to soil but will grow in\r\nloam, sand, gravel, or among rocks. It is not abundant.\r\n\r\nWhen it grows near the sea it is apt to lose its tree form and become a\r\nshrub. It assumes that form on Santa Cruz and Santa Rosa islands off the\r\ncoast of southern California. It grows slowly and is tenacious of life.\r\nWhen it has once secured a foothold it hangs on with determination,\r\nthough exposed to severe storms and inhospitable conditions. The acorns\r\ndo not mature until late in the autumn of their second year. They are\r\nsometimes an inch and a half long, and scarcely a third of an inch\r\nthick. The wood of this oak possesses some good qualities which are\r\nlocally appreciated by wagon makers who use it for repair work. It is\r\nextensively cut for fuel, and it burns about like eastern white oak, but\r\nleaves more ashes. The dry wood weighs 49 pounds per cubic foot. It is\r\nconsiderably weaker than white oak and is less elastic. The summerwood\r\nconstitutes a large part of the annual growth ring. It is very porous,\r\nthe rows of pores running parallel with the medullary rays. This part of\r\nthe wood structure is midway between that of deciduous and the evergreen\r\noaks. The medullary rays are broad but short. When exposed on a\r\ntangential surface, they are from one-fourth to one-half inch long, and\r\ngive the wood a flecked appearance. Exposed in cross section, they are\r\nfrom one inch to four inches in length. This applies, of course, only to\r\nlarge rays, easily seen with the naked eye. In quarter-sawed lumber, the\r\nrays have a pinkish color and glossy luster which are not pleasing. This\r\ntree belongs in the class with those which are in no danger of being\r\nextirpated by human agencies. It occupies land which man does not need\r\nand will never want.\r\n\r\n    MYRTLE OAK (_Quercus myrtifolia_) associates with the laurel oak in\r\n    some parts of South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida, and closely\r\n    resembles it, though it is smaller, and gives little promise of ever\r\n    becoming important in a commercial way. It is clearly in the scrub\r\n    oak class, and does not approach the dignity of even a small tree in\r\n    most of its range. Few specimens can be found exceeding a height of\r\n    twenty feet and a diameter of five or six inches. Trees approaching\r\n    that size grow in western Florida in the region of the Apalachicola\r\n    river. Generally this oak covers dry, sandy ridges and islands, and\r\n    is shrubby. It forms thickets on some of the islands off the coast\r\n    of Alabama and Mississippi, and extends its range westward to the\r\n    low, southern parts of Louisiana where the dwarf trees are almost\r\n    hidden by tall reeds and grass. Its name refers to the leaf it\r\n    bears. It is impossible that man can ever make much use of this\r\n    tree.\r\n\r\n    MOREHUS OAK (_Quercus morehus_) can never be important in the lumber\r\n    industry, but it fills a few places in California where the ground\r\n    needs a cover. Its range is in the northern coast range and the\r\n    Sierra foothills, extending as far south as Kings river. The edges\r\n    of the leaves bear bent hooks like saw teeth. The foliage falls in\r\n    late winter. Trees are occasionally a foot or more in diameter. The\r\n    wood has not the appearance of possessing much value, and is too\r\n    scarce to be important. The most interesting thing connected with\r\n    this tree is that it is supposed to be a hybrid--a cross between\r\n    highland oak and California black oak. It was first found in 1863,\r\n    and a considerable range has since been established for it.\r\n\r\n    It is the opinion of some investigators that new tree species have\r\n    their origin in crosses between existing species. Of the countless\r\n    thousands of such crosses a few, at long intervals of time, may\r\n    develop characteristics which enable them to maintain their\r\n    existence and to spread into new territory. If that occurs, a new\r\n    kind of tree has appeared on earth and is ready to take its place\r\n    among the established forests of the region. Cross-fertilization\r\n    among trees and plants is very common, but so many adverse\r\n    conditions are encountered, that few hybrids ever amount to\r\n    anything.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPIN OAK\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PIN OAK]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPIN OAK\r\n\r\n(_Quercus Palustris_)\r\n\r\n\r\nPin oak ranges from certain sections of Massachusetts, notably the\r\nConnecticut river valley, and near Amherst, westward as far as the\r\nsoutheastern part of Missouri; on the south it is found along the lower\r\nPotomac river in Virginia, in Kentucky, Arkansas, and Oklahoma.\r\n\r\nIt is known as pin oak in Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New\r\nYork, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Virginia, Maryland, Arkansas, Missouri,\r\nIllinois, Wisconsin, Iowa, and Kansas; in Arkansas and Kansas it is\r\ncalled swamp Spanish oak; in Rhode Island and Illinois it is often known\r\nas water oak; in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Kansas as swamp oak; in\r\nArkansas as water Spanish oak.\r\n\r\nThe name pin oak is said to belong to this tree because of a peculiarity\r\nof its branches. They leave the trunk and the larger limbs at nearly\r\nright angles, and criss-cross in all directions, resembling pins thrust\r\ninto the wood, and bristling outward at every angle. The crowding to\r\nwhich they are subjected kills many of them as the tree reaches middle\r\nage, but the stubs do not drop quickly, and as many of the\r\ncharacteristic pins appear to be present as ever. Such is the usual\r\nexplanation given to account for the name, and the facts fit the theory;\r\nbut the fact that several other species are called pin oaks is not\r\naccounted for. The habit of the branches of all of them is not the same.\r\nThe Gambel oak in its Arizona range has that name. So has the chinquapin\r\noak in Arkansas and Texas, but that is apparently a shortening of its\r\ntrue name, the last syllable only being used. They call the Durand oak\r\npin oak in Texas, but without any known reason.\r\n\r\nThe botanical name _palustris_, belonging to this species, refers to the\r\ntree’s habit of growing in swamps and damp land along river bottoms. It\r\nis not a swamp tree as cypress is, but is more like swamp white oak, and\r\nfinds its most congenial surroundings on the borders of streams and on\r\nfairly well drained lowland where roots readily reach water.\r\n\r\nThe leaves are three or five inches long, are simple, and alternate.\r\nThey are broad, and have from five to nine lobes which are toothed, and\r\nbristle-tipped on the ends. The sinuses are broad and rounded, and\r\nextend well toward the midrib, which is stout, and from which the veins\r\nbranch off conspicuously. In color the leaves are bright green above and\r\nlighter below when young, becoming thin, firm and darker green at\r\nmaturity; late in autumn they turn a rich, deep scarlet. They are coated\r\nbelow with pubescence, and have large tufts of pale hairs in the axils\r\nof the veins.\r\n\r\nThe fruit of pin oak is a small acorn which grows either sessile or on a\r\nvery short stem; sometimes in clusters, and sometimes singly. In shape\r\nthe acorns are nearly hemispherical, and measure about a half inch in\r\ndiameter; they are enclosed only at the base, in a thin, saucer-shaped\r\ncup, dark brown, and scaly.\r\n\r\nThe bark of a mature tree is dark gray or brownish-green; it is rough,\r\nbeing full of small furrows, and frequently cracks open and shows the\r\nreddish inner layer of bark. On small branches and young trunks, it is\r\nsmoother, lighter, and more lustrous.\r\n\r\nPin oak is smaller than red oak. Average trees are seventy or eighty\r\nfeet high and two or three in diameter. Specimens 120 feet high and four\r\nfeet in diameter are heard of but are seldom seen. Near the northern\r\nlimit of pin oak’s range large trees are not found, nor are small trees\r\nplentiful. This holds true in all parts of New England and northern New\r\nYork where the species is found growing naturally. South of\r\nPennsylvania, along the flood plains of rivers which flow to Chesapeake\r\nbay, a better class of timber is found. The best development of the\r\nspecies is in the lower Ohio valley.\r\n\r\nIt grows rapidly, but falls a little short of the red oak. When young\r\ngrowth is cut, sprouts will rise from the stumps and flourish for a\r\ntime, but merchantable trees are seldom or never produced that way. The\r\nacorn must be depended on. It has been remarked that pin oak does not\r\nprune itself well, but it does better in dense stands than in open\r\nground. In the latter case the limbs are late in dying and falling.\r\n\r\nPin oak has proved to be a valuable street and park tree. It possesses\r\nseveral characteristics which recommend it for that use. It grows\r\nrapidly, and it quickly attains a size which lessens its liability to\r\ninjury by accidents. Its shade is tolerably dense; the crown is shapely\r\nand attractive; the leaves fall late; and it seems to stand the smoke\r\nand dust of cities better than many other trees. It is easily and\r\nsuccessfully transplanted if taken when small. Many towns and cities\r\nfrom Long Island to Washington, D. C., have planted the pin oak along\r\nstreets, avenues, and in parks. Several thoroughfares in Washington are\r\nshaded by them.\r\n\r\nConsiderable planting of pin oak has been done by railroads which expect\r\nto grow ties. Trees of this species when cut in forests and made into\r\ncrossties do not all show similar resistance to decay. Some ties are\r\nperishable in a short time, while others give satisfactory service. The\r\nbest endure well without preservative treatment, but all are benefited\r\nby it. If the experimental plantings turn out well, it may be expected\r\nthat pin oak will fill an important place in the crosstie business.\r\n\r\nBecause of numerous limbs, lumber cut from pin oak is apt to be knotty,\r\nand the percentage of good grades small. The annual rings are wide, and\r\nare about evenly divided between spring and summerwood, though the\r\nlatter often exceeds the former. Its general appearance suggests red\r\noak, but it is more porous in trunks of thrifty growth. The springwood\r\nis largely made up of pores. The medullary rays are hardly as prominent\r\nas those of red oak, but in other ways resemble them. The wood weighs\r\n43.24 pounds per cubic foot, which is a little above red oak. It is hard\r\nand strong, dark brown with thin sapwood of darker color. The lumber\r\nchecks and warps badly in seasoning.\r\n\r\nThe uses to which pin oak is put must be considered in a general way\r\nbecause of the absence of exact statistics. The wood is not listed by\r\nthe lumber trade under its own name, but goes along with others of the\r\nblack oak group. Its uses, however, are known along a number of lines.\r\nLumbermen cut it wherever it is found mixed with other hardwoods.\r\nSometimes vehicle manufacturers make a point of securing a supply of\r\nthis wood. That occurs oftener with small concerns than large. It is\r\nmade into felloes, reaches, and bolsters. Furniture makers use it, and\r\nwell selected, quarter-sawed stock is occasionally reduced to veneer.\r\nThe articles produced pass for red oak, and it would be very difficult\r\nto detect the difference between pin oak and true red oak when finished\r\nas veneer. Some highly attractive mission furniture is said to be of pin\r\noak.\r\n\r\nMore goes to chair stock mills than to factories which produce higher\r\nclasses of furniture. Chairs utilize very small pieces, and that gives\r\nthe stock cutter a chance to trim out the knots and produce the maximum\r\namount of clear stuff. Chair makers in Michigan reported the use of\r\n60,000 feet of pin oak in 1910. Slack coopers work in much the same way\r\nas chair mills, and pin oak is acceptable material for many classes of\r\nbarrels and other containers. Small tight knots are frequently not\r\ndefects sufficient to cause the rejection of staves. Tight coopers do\r\nnot find pin oak suitable, because the wood is too porous to hold\r\nliquids, particularly liquors containing alcohol. The wood is mixed at\r\nmills with red oak and other similar species and is manufactured into\r\npicture frames, boxes, crates, interior finish for houses, and many\r\nother commodities requiring strength or handsome finish. In early years\r\nwhen the people manufactured by hand what they needed, and obtained\r\ntheir timber from the nearest forest or woodlot, they split fence rails,\r\npickets, clapboards, and shingles of pin oak.\r\n\r\nOak-apples or galls are the round excrescences formed on the limbs by\r\ngallflies and their eggs. They seem particularly fond of this species\r\nand specimens are often seen which are literally covered with them. The\r\nworms which live inside seem to flourish particularly well on the food\r\nthey imbibe from pin oak. The primitive school teachers three or four\r\ngenerations ago turned these oak galls to account. They are rich in\r\ntannin, and were employed in manufacturing the local ink supply. The\r\nteachers were the ink makers as well as the pen cutters when the pens\r\nwere whittled from quills. The process of making the ink was simple. The\r\ngalls were soaked in a kettle of water and nails. The iron acted on the\r\ntannin and produced the desired blackness, but if special luster was\r\ndesired, it was furnished by adding the fruit of the wild greenbrier\r\n(_Smilax rotundifolia_), which grew abundantly in the woods. It was well\r\nthat steel pens were not then in use, for the schoolmaster’s oak ink\r\nwould have eaten up such a pen in a single day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCALIFORNIA LIVE OAK\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CALIFORNIA LIVE OAK]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCALIFORNIA LIVE OAK\r\n\r\n(_Quercus Agrifolia_)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis fine western tree belongs to the black oak group, yet its acorns\r\nmature in one year, like those of white oaks. It is the only known black\r\noak with that habit. It is properly classed with canyon live oak which\r\nhas many characteristics of white oak, yet matures its acorns the second\r\nyear. The two oaks with freakish fruit belong in California, and to some\r\nextent occupy the same range. California live oak is apparently making\r\nan effort to conform to the habit of other black oaks by producing two\r\nyear acorns. It has not yet succeeded in doing so, but flowers\r\noccasionally appear in the fall, and young acorns set on the twigs. They\r\ndrop during the winter, and it is not believed that any of them hang\r\ntill the second season.\r\n\r\nThe range of this tree covers most of the California coast region but\r\ndoes not reach the great interior valleys. The tree is very common in\r\nthe southwestern part of the state. It is called an evergreen, and some\r\nindividuals deserve that reputation, but the leaves never remain long\r\nafter the new crop appears. Frequently the old leaves do not wait for\r\nthe new, and when they drop, the branches remain bare for a few weeks.\r\nThe form of the leaf is not constant. Some have smooth margins, but the\r\ntypical leaf is toothed like holly. One of the early names by which the\r\ntree was known was holly-leaved oak. The bark looks much like the bark\r\nof chestnut oak. It is bought for tanning purposes, but its principal\r\nuse is to adulterate the bark of another oak (_Quercus densiflora_).\r\nTrees range in height from twenty-five to seventy-five feet, and from\r\none foot to four in diameter. The trunks are very short, and seldom\r\nafford clear lengths exceeding eight feet, and often not more than four.\r\nTrees generally grow in the open, but when in thickets, the boles\r\nlengthen somewhat. They are of slow growth and live to old age.\r\n\r\nThe wood is hard and brittle. A cubic foot weighs 51.43 pounds when\r\nthoroughly dry. The wood of mature trees is reddish-brown; but young and\r\nmiddle aged trunks are all sapwood, and are white from bark to center.\r\nWhen sapwood is exposed to the air a considerable time it changes color\r\nand becomes very dark brown. The medullary rays of this oak are broad,\r\nfairly numerous, and are darker than the surrounding wood. When the log\r\nis quarter-sawed, the exposed flecks of bright surface are the darkest\r\nparts. To that extent, it resembles quarter-sawed sycamore, but the\r\nwoods do not look alike in any other particular. This oak is very\r\nporous, and the pores--as is usual with live oaks--are arranged in rows\r\nrunning from bark to center rather than parallel with the annual rings.\r\nNo clear line is distinguishable between spring and summerwood.\r\n\r\nCordwood constitutes the most important use for California live oak. It\r\nrates high in fuel value, and the many large and crooked limbs make the\r\ntree an ideal one, from the cordwood cutter’s viewpoint. By carefully\r\nricking the wood, with the crooks and elbows in every possible\r\ndirection--at which some cordwood cutters are very proficient--a cord of\r\nwood may be constructed in the forest, which, when sold and delivered in\r\nthe buyer’s shed, contracts like an accordion.\r\n\r\n    CANYON LIVE OAK (_Quercus chrysolepis_). This splendid California\r\n    oak bears many names. It is an evergreen, and therefore is called\r\n    live oak. It is hard when thoroughly seasoned, and this has won for\r\n    it the name iron oak. Wagon makers often so designate it. It is\r\n    called Valparaiso oak, but for what reason is not apparent. Black\r\n    live oak doubtless refers to the dark color of the foliage. The most\r\n    shapely trees grow in the bottoms of canyons, and the name, canyon\r\n    live oak, refers to that circumstance. Hickory oak is not an\r\n    appropriate name, though it doubtless implies that the wood\r\n    possesses the toughness of hickory. It is about as tough as white\r\n    oak. The name golden cup oak is a translation of its botanical name\r\n    which, in Greek, means “golden scale,” a reference to a yellow\r\n    tomentum or wool which covers the cups of the acorns. The wood’s\r\n    hardness qualifies it to serve as mauls, hence the name maul oak.\r\n\r\n    The northern limit of its growth is in southern Oregon. It goes\r\n    south from there on the coast ranges of California and the western\r\n    slopes of the Sierra Nevadas to the highlands of southern\r\n    California. Its growth on the mountains of southern Arizona and New\r\n    Mexico is always shrubby. The lowest limit of its range is about\r\n    1,000 feet above sea level, the best specimens occurring at low\r\n    altitudes in the sheltered canyons of the coast ranges of\r\n    California. Gradually diminishing in size, it grows to the very tops\r\n    of many of the high mountains, sometimes reaching 9,000 feet, being\r\n    not more than a foot high at the upper limits of its range. In\r\n    appearance this tree resembles the eastern live oak (_Quercus\r\n    virginiana_), having the same majestic wide-spreading crown, except\r\n    in the high altitudes where it forms dense thickets covering large\r\n    areas.\r\n\r\n    When in its favorite habitat, the massive proportions and majestic\r\n    appearance of this tree are imposing, the crown sometimes being 150\r\n    feet across, the bole short and thick, and the great branches long\r\n    and horizontal. It is not clothed in the somber Spanish moss that is\r\n    often present on the great live oaks of the southeastern states, but\r\n    there is a similarity of appearance in the drooping slender twigs.\r\n    One hundred and fifty feet across is cited as an unusual width of\r\n    crown, one hundred feet being a good average size, and forty or\r\n    fifty feet the usual height, although it sometimes reaches 100. The\r\n    bole is vested in a gray-brown, reddish-tinged bark, about an inch\r\n    thick, and broken into numerous scales which in old age become flaky\r\n    and pliable and fall off.\r\n\r\n    The bark is light colored, and has the stringy character of white\r\n    oak. The tree would readily pass for a white oak were it not for its\r\n    two-year acorns which class it in the black oak group. The wood\r\n    resembles white oak, and weighs 52.93 pounds per cubic foot.\r\n\r\n    Few oaks, if any, retain their leaves a longer time than this. They\r\n    remain on the branches three or four years. Most evergreen oaks shed\r\n    theirs at the beginning of the second year. The leaves of this tree\r\n    are peculiar in another way. They assume various forms. That in\r\n    itself is not unusual and occurs with many species; but the canyon\r\n    live oak has one pattern of leaf for the young tree, another for the\r\n    old. One form has a margin with sharp, hooked teeth; another has\r\n    smooth-margined leaves, and there are various intermediate forms.\r\n    Sizes vary no less than shapes of both acorns and leaves. Some\r\n    acorns are half an inch in length, others two inches.\r\n\r\n    The canyon live oak is believed to be long-lived, but further\r\n    information is desirable. The massive trunks represent centuries.\r\n    They usually occur in sheltered places which are measurably secure\r\n    from the ordinary perils which beset trees, notably the woodsman’s\r\n    ax and the periodic forest fire. The bottoms of canyons where this\r\n    oak makes choice of situation do not usually burn fiercely, and\r\n    trees sheltered there escape. Cordwood cutters are the most constant\r\n    peril to good fuel trees in California; but many a canyon is safe\r\n    from their invasions, because of lack of roads. There the most\r\n    magnificent oaks rear their crowns in security, while trees of\r\n    inferior size and character, which grow on exposed slopes and flats,\r\n    fall before the cordwood cutter, and go to the ricks in village\r\n    woodyards.\r\n\r\n    The wood of canyon live oak is superior to that of any other oak in\r\n    its range. It is of light brown color, and is tough, strong, stiff,\r\n    and heavy. The trunks are generally unsuitable for sawlogs, being\r\n    too short, but when a chance tree is found that may be cut into\r\n    lumber, it is considered a prize. Trunks are seldom good for more\r\n    than one sawlog. In that respect this oak may be compared with the\r\n    southern live oak. The scarcity of good hardwoods on the Pacific\r\n    coast adds to the value of what may be found there. If the canyon\r\n    live oak grew in the East, and developed a trunk of the same size\r\n    and shape as it has in its present home, it would attract no more\r\n    attention from the users of hardwoods than the live oak in the South\r\n    attracts now. But place makes great difference.\r\n\r\n    Factories in California do not report the use of much of this oak,\r\n    yet considerable quantities of it are in service. The most important\r\n    place found for it is in country and village blacksmith shops, where\r\n    wagons are repaired. Nearly every piece of wood which goes into a\r\n    wagon, except the bed, may be this oak. Many persons consider it the\r\n    best wagon timber on the Pacific coast, and it is particularly\r\n    valued for tongues, not only for wagons, but for heavy log trucks\r\n    which are operated by several yoke of oxen. The wood is likewise\r\n    made into singletrees. It has always been in use in California for\r\n    pack saddles. That article is small, but many saddles were formerly\r\n    made, and the pack saddle is still an important article in the\r\n    mountains. Trains of mules, horses, and burros thread the narrow\r\n    paths, where wheeled vehicles cannot go, and deliver supplies to\r\n    camps and mines in remote districts. The pack saddle’s strength is\r\n    frequently all that intervenes between the load and destruction; for\r\n    the snapping of a piece of wood may let the pack go over a precipice\r\n    beyond recovery. The pack trains are slowly passing out of use in\r\n    the West, as they long ago disappeared from the “bridle paths” of\r\n    eastern mountains and forests; but they are still to be seen among\r\n    the fastnesses of the Sierra Nevadas, as in the days when a western\r\n    poet burst into inspired song of the long pack trains going\r\n\r\n      “Up and down o’er the mountain trail\r\n      With one horse tied to another’s tail.”\r\n\r\n    HUCKLEBERRY OAK (_Quercus chrysolepis vaccinifolia_) is a variety of\r\n    canyon live oak, and is never large enough to supply wood for any\r\n    purpose, but is valuable as a covering to the ground on exposed\r\n    mountains. It is usually a shrub, and specimens no more than a foot\r\n    high are mature and bear acorns enormously out of proportion to the\r\n    size of the tree. If the canyon live oak of largest size in the low\r\n    hills bore acorns proportionately as large, they would be the size\r\n    of barrels. The huckleberry oak’s acorns are set in their golden\r\n    cups. The name huckleberry is applied because of a fancied\r\n    resemblance of the leaves to those of huckleberries. They are\r\n    generally less than one inch in length, sometimes not half an inch.\r\n    This unique variety of oak ranges on elevated slopes and ridges of\r\n    the Sierra Nevada mountains, and the traveler in climbing to the\r\n    peaks is often grateful for the privilege of pulling himself up the\r\n    steep slopes by grasping in his hands the tops of full grown trees.\r\n\r\n    PALMER OAK (_Quercus chrysolepis palmeri_) is considered a variety\r\n    of canyon live oak by some, but Sudworth believes it is a distinct\r\n    species, and draws his conclusion from forms of leaves, flowers, and\r\n    fruit. It forms large thickets on foothills and plateaus near the\r\n    southern boundary of California, eighty miles or more east of San\r\n    Diego. The trees do not attain sufficient size to give them\r\n    commercial importance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCALIFORNIA TANBARK OAK\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CALIFORNIA TANBARK OAK]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCALIFORNIA TANBARK OAK\r\n\r\n(_Quercus Densiflora_)\r\n\r\n\r\nBotanists dispute the right of this tree to the name of oak, and some of\r\nthem refuse to call it an oak. It is admitted that it possesses\r\ncharacters not found in any other oak, but these are important to the\r\nbotanist only, while laymen have never considered the tree anything but\r\nan oak. It has been variously called tanbark oak, chestnut oak,\r\nCalifornia chestnut oak, live oak, and peach oak. The trunk, branches,\r\nand foliage look much like chestnut. The leaf is like the chestnut’s,\r\nbut it is evergreen. There are three or four crops on the tree at one\r\ntime, and none fall until they are three or four years old. Young leaves\r\nare remarkably woolly, but late in their first summer they get rid of\r\nmost of the fuzz, and become thick in texture.\r\n\r\nTanbark oaks are of all sizes, from mere shrubs on high mountains in the\r\nnorthern Sierra Nevadas to fine and symmetrical timber in the damp\r\nclimate of the fog belt between San Francisco and the Oregon line. The\r\naverage height of mature trees is from seventy to 100 feet, with\r\ndiameters up to six feet in rare cases, though more trunks are under\r\nthan over two feet in diameter.\r\n\r\nThe range of this oak reaches southern Oregon on the north, and runs\r\nsouthward three or four hundred miles along the Sierra Nevada mountains,\r\nto Mariposa county, and six hundred miles through the Coast range to\r\nSanta Barbara county. The tree is affected by climatic conditions, and\r\nwhere surroundings do not suit, it is small and shrubby, often less than\r\nten feet high. It does best in the redwood belt where fogs from the\r\nPacific ocean keep the air moist and the ground damp. It sometimes\r\nassociates with Douglas fir, and at other times with California live\r\noak. If it grows in dense side shade it loses its lower branches and\r\ndevelops a long, clean trunk; but in open ground it keeps its limbs\r\nuntil late in life.\r\n\r\nThis is the most important source of tanbark on the Pacific coast, and\r\nup to the present it has been procurable in large quantities. The annual\r\noutput is nearly 40,000 tons, and it commands a higher price than the\r\nbark of any other oak or of hemlock. The absence of other adequate\r\ntanning materials on the Pacific coast gives this tree much importance.\r\nIts range covers several thousand square miles, and the stand is fairly\r\ngood on much of it. But on the other hand, the destruction of timber to\r\nsecure the bark has been excessive. What occurred with chestnut oak and\r\nhemlock in the East, is occurring with tanbark oak in the West. Trees\r\nare cut and peeled, and are left by thousands to rot in the woods, or\r\nto feed fires and make them more destructive. The bark peelers do their\r\nprincipal work in the California redwood region, because there the oak\r\nis at its best. Economic conditions make the salvage of the trunks\r\nimpossible. The bark can be hauled to market, but the wood is unsalable\r\nat living prices, after the long haul. It has, therefore, been usually\r\nabandoned, and becomes a total loss. It cannot even be sold for fuel,\r\nbecause the country within reach of it is thinly settled, and wood is\r\nplentiful on every side.\r\n\r\nLarge oaks are felled, because the bark can not be stripped from the\r\ntrunks in any other way, and small trees are not spared. The peelers\r\noften do not take the trouble to cut them down, but strip off the bark\r\nas high as a man can reach, and leave them standing. A future tree is\r\nthus destroyed for the sake of a strip of bark a few feet long. Such\r\ntrees live a year or two, sometimes several years, before yielding to\r\nthe inevitable. Usually, as a last expiring effort, they bear an\r\nabnormally large crop of acorns. That performance, in the language of\r\nthe bark peelers, is “the last kick.” A tanbark slashing, when the\r\npeelers are ready to abandon it, is a sorry spectacle. The barkless and\r\nsun-cracked trunks strew the ground, the tops and limbs are piled in\r\nwindrows, the small peeled trees stand dying, and the last ricks of bark\r\nhave been sledded down the tote roads, marking the close of operations\r\nin that district. A few months later, when fire runs through, the end of\r\nthe tanbark oak on that tract is accomplished.\r\n\r\nWithin recent years commendable efforts have been made to use the wood\r\nas well as the bark. One of the first steps in that direction was to\r\novercome the prejudice against the wood. It was long considered to be\r\nvalueless. That belief was founded on the single fact that this oak is\r\ndifficult to season. Few woods in this country check as badly as this,\r\nwhen it is left exposed to sun and wind after the bark has been removed.\r\nIt checks both radially and along the annual rings. The medullary rays\r\nare broad and extend much of the distance from the center to the\r\noutside. These are natural lines of cleavage when the log begins to\r\nseason and the internal stresses develop. It must be admitted that the\r\nprospect of making anything out of timber of that character is\r\ndiscouraging; but it has been accomplished, and tanbark oak is now a\r\nmaterial of considerable value.\r\n\r\nThe wood has about the strength and stiffness of white oak, while it is\r\nfour pounds lighter per cubic foot. The structure is similar to that of\r\nCalifornia live oak, but the pores of tanbark oak are smaller. They run\r\nin rows from center to circumference. The medullary rays are broad\r\nenough to show well in quarter-sawing, but the wood’s appearance when so\r\nworked is not wholly satisfactory. The exposed flat surfaces of the\r\nrays show a faint purplish or violet tinge which is considered\r\nobjectionable. But when the wood is worked plain it is dependable and\r\nsubstantial. It makes good flooring, fairly good furniture, finish,\r\nvehicles, and agricultural implements. It is perishable when placed in\r\ndamp situations, and this detracts somewhat from its value as railway\r\nties; but the wood’s porous nature indicates that it will readily yield\r\nto preservative treatment.\r\n\r\nSince the value of the wood is coming to be understood it is to be\r\nexpected that less of it will be destroyed than formerly, and that\r\nsecond growth will be given opportunity to hold the ground when old\r\nstands are cut. The tree is a prolific seeder, but not every year, and\r\nseedlings come up abundantly in sheltered places. Sprouts rise from\r\nstumps and grow to vigorous trees. It would seem, therefore, that the\r\ntanbark oak will hold at least part of the ground where nature planted\r\nit.\r\n\r\nTOUMEY OAK (_Quercus toumeyi_). No oak in this country has smaller\r\nleaves than this. They are usually less than three-fourths of an inch\r\nlong and half an inch wide, and they hang on petioles one-sixteenth inch\r\nlong. The leaves have no lobes or notches. They remain all winter and\r\nfall in the spring in time to make room for the new crop. The acorns are\r\nnearly as long as the leaves and ripen in June of the first year. Few\r\npersons ever see this oak, for its known range is restricted to Mule\r\nmountain, in Cochise county, southeastern Arizona. It attains a height\r\nof twenty-five or thirty feet, and a diameter of six or eight inches.\r\nThe trunk is not only small, but is of form so poor that it can never be\r\nof value for anything but fuel. It divides near the ground into crooked\r\nbranches. The heart of the tree is light brown, the thick sapwood is\r\nlighter.\r\n\r\n    WOOLLY OAK (_Quercus tomentella_) has apparently been crowded off\r\n    the American continent and has taken refuge on islands off the\r\n    southern California coast. As far as known, not a single tree stands\r\n    on the mainland, but several groves, with a few isolated specimens,\r\n    are found on Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa, and Catalina islands, where\r\n    they are huddled together in the bottoms of sheltered canyons. The\r\n    leaves are thick, leathery, and are toothed like holly. The trees\r\n    are evergreen. The acorns do not mature until the second season.\r\n    They are generally more than an inch long. The scarcity of this oak\r\n    relegates it to an unimportant place among commercial woods. This\r\n    seems unfortunate, for the appearance of the wood indicates that it\r\n    possesses excellent properties. No other oak looks like this wood.\r\n    It is decidedly yellow, and is dense and firm. The medullary rays\r\n    are different from those of any other oak. When seen in cross\r\n    section they are arranged in short, wavy lines, broadest in the\r\n    middle and tapering toward both ends. The pores are arranged between\r\n    the rays, and follow wavy lines also. Trees grow with fair rapidity,\r\n    and the largest on the islands are seventy-five feet high and two in\r\n    diameter.\r\n\r\n    BARREN OAK (_Quercus pumila_) is called dwarf black oak, or simply\r\n    scrub oak. Its habit of growing on barren land is responsible for\r\n    its common name which some people shorten to “bear” oak. It is one\r\n    of the poorest oaks of the East, and it seldom grows more than\r\n    twenty-five feet high and a few inches in diameter. Its range\r\n    follows the Atlantic coast southward from Mount Desert Island,\r\n    Maine, to North Carolina. It is probably more abundant on the pine\r\n    barrens of New Jersey than elsewhere. The trunks are too small to be\r\n    of use for anything but fuel.\r\n\r\n    PRICE OAK (_Quercus pricei_) is a California tree, supposed to be\r\n    very local in its range, since it has not been found outside the\r\n    drainage basin of a small stream in Monterey county. That locality\r\n    on the coast of California appears to be the starting place or\r\n    principal abiding place of several tree species, among which are\r\n    Monterey cypress and Monterey pine. The Price oak attains a height\r\n    of twenty-five or thirty feet, and a diameter of twelve inches or\r\n    less; consequently it is too small to be of value to lumbermen, even\r\n    if it were abundant. The leaves resemble those of California live\r\n    oak, and are believed to remain two summers on the tree. The acorns\r\n    mature the second season.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSHINGLE OAK\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHINGLE OAK]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSHINGLE OAK\r\n\r\n(_Quercus Imbricaria_)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe origin of this tree’s name has been the subject of considerable\r\ncontroversy. According to one account the name was first used by the\r\nFrench colonists at Kaskaskia, Illinois, nearly 150 years ago. They\r\nfound that the wood rived well and it was abundant in the vicinity of\r\ntheir settlement. They split it for shingles and covered their cabins.\r\nIt was the best wood obtainable for the purpose in that region, and they\r\ndesignated the tree shingle oak, a name translated into Latin by the\r\nbotanist Michaux and still retained as the tree’s botanical name. The\r\nstory of the name appears to be well authenticated, but the fact cannot\r\nbe denied that as much reason exists for another theory. A person who\r\nsees a shingle oak tree in full leaf, particularly if it stands in open\r\nground where its foliage has had opportunity to develop along natural\r\nlines, will at once notice the peculiar and characteristic overlapping\r\nof the leaves. They suggest the courses of shingles nailed on a roof. No\r\nother oak has that arrangement. The similitude is so striking that it\r\nwould be surprising if the name shingle oak were not applied.\r\n\r\nIt is not a one-name tree, but following the fashion, it carries several\r\nnames. It is called laurel oak in some regions. The form and appearance\r\nof the leaf give the name. The oak looks like a mammoth laurel tree more\r\nthan like its own species. The shingle oak is known as jack oak in some\r\nparts of Illinois. That is a name liable to be applied to any tree when\r\nits real name is not known. In North Carolina they call the tree water\r\noak, which name, like jack oak, is often used to conceal ignorance of\r\nthe true name. Another southern species (_Quercus nigra_) is properly\r\nnamed water oak.\r\n\r\nShingle oak requires good soil for growth but is not partial either to\r\nuplands or bottoms. It is found at its best in the lower Ohio river\r\nbasin and in Missouri, but is comparatively rare in the East. From\r\nmiddle Pennsylvania its range extends southward along the Alleghanies to\r\nnorthern Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee, and west Arkansas. It is found in\r\nMichigan, Wisconsin, and westward to Kansas.\r\n\r\nIt manifests a strong tendency to hybridize with other oaks, and it\r\nreadily crosses with black jack oak, pin oak, and yellow oak. It is\r\nbelieved that a cross between yellow oak and shingle oak produced the\r\nspecies known as lea oak.\r\n\r\nA mature tree may be one hundred feet high and three or four feet in\r\ndiameter. It has a round or pyramidal attractive crown composed of many\r\nslender branches and twigs. The foliage is distinctively grouped at the\r\nends of the twigs in star-like clusters. The leaves are four or six\r\ninches long, with wedge-shaped or rounded bases, and are deep green and\r\nshiny on the upper side, but lighter below. The acorns are short,\r\nstubby, and rounded, covered one-third of the way with thin shallow\r\ncups.\r\n\r\nShingle oak grows rapidly, and it is often sold by nurseries which deal\r\nin ornamental forest trees. It is hardy as far north as Massachusetts.\r\nAlthough it bears great abundance of leaves, they are so arranged that\r\nthe crown seems open. One may see through the branches of a large\r\nshingle oak, and it suggests an airiness not common with oaks.\r\n\r\nDifferences of opinion exist concerning the value of shingle oak for\r\ncommercial purposes. It belongs in the black oak group, and its wood\r\ngoes to market as red oak, and apparently is never listed as anything\r\nelse. It is never named in market reports; shops and factories never\r\nreport it, and it has been pronounced inferior to red oak in strength\r\nand seasoning properties. Tests have been made of some of its physical\r\nproperties, and the results do not indicate that the wood belongs with\r\ninferior timbers. Its breaking strength is given at 39 per cent greater\r\nthan white oak, and its stiffness at 28 per cent greater. However, these\r\nvalues, which are calculated from Sargent’s tables, are based on tests\r\nof only a few specimens of the wood, and fuller investigation might make\r\nrevision necessary.\r\n\r\nThe wood is heavy, hard, and is said to check badly in drying. The pores\r\nare large and are arranged in rows; medullary rays are broad and\r\nconspicuous. The wood is light brown, tinged with red, the sapwood much\r\nlighter. The broad medullary rays, running radially, give the wood its\r\ngood splitting qualities.\r\n\r\nThe tree is fairly abundant in different parts of its range, and is cut\r\nand manufactured with other oaks and hardwoods. Slack coopers use it for\r\nbarrels; box makers employ it for crates; chair mills saw dimension\r\nstock and ship it to factories to be finished; some goes to furniture\r\nfactories; some is turned for spindles for grills, and for balusters for\r\nstairs; other fills various places as interior finish and molding. But\r\nit all goes to market and passes through factories under names other\r\nthan its own.\r\n\r\nWATER OAK (_Quercus nigra_) has several names, some of them bestowed\r\nwith little apparent reason. It is called possum oak and duck oak, but\r\nthese names are neither descriptive nor definitive. Punk oak is another\r\nname. It may refer to a decayed condition of the wood, but this tree is\r\nno more affected by decay than others of the same region. In Texas it is\r\nsometimes known as spotted oak. It thrives in wet situations though not\r\nactually in swamps. It prefers margins of ponds, banks of rivers, and\r\nlow swales where the ground water is just below the surface, but it is\r\nnot confined to such situations. It does well, within its range,\r\nwherever willow oak flourishes, but willow oak has a wider range. The\r\nleaves take on various forms, and they change shape as they increase in\r\nsize. Some have smooth margins, others are lobed. Some are wedge-shaped,\r\nothers coffin-shaped. Their typical form, if it may be said of them that\r\nthey have a typical form, is narrow at the stem end and wide at the\r\nother. To this is usually added rudimentary lobes, which are sometimes\r\nnearly as well developed as in any other oak. Their typical form is like\r\nthe leaf of the black jack oak; but they are not half as large, and are\r\nthin and delicate, while the black jack’s leaf is thick and leathery.\r\n\r\nThe range of water oak begins in Delaware and follows the Atlantic\r\ncoastal plain south to central Florida, and through the Gulf States to\r\nTexas. It grows as far north as Kentucky and Missouri. It keeps clear of\r\nthe Appalachian mountain region, and other hilly districts. It is\r\nplentiful in some parts of its range, and trunks three feet in diameter\r\nand long enough for two or three logs are not unusual, yet large numbers\r\nof water oaks may be seen in the South which are not fit for sawlogs\r\nbecause they stand in open ground and are limby down to ten feet of the\r\nground. Many have been planted for shade trees in streets and in parks,\r\nand are justly admired. They grow rapidly and are extremely graceful.\r\nTheir leaves are deciduous, but adhere to the branches most of the year.\r\nSouth of the belt of severe frost, the old leaves frequently hang until\r\nthe buds for the new crop are opening. The acorns are bitter, and even\r\nthe southern pine hog passes them by until the pinch of famine edges up\r\nhis appetite.\r\n\r\nWater oak possesses value as a source of lumber, but it belongs with the\r\nlarge class of oaks which lose their names and their identity when they\r\npass the threshold of the sawmill. They come out red oak. Only in rare\r\ninstances is water oak called by its own name in the factory and lumber\r\nyard. Wagon makers employ it for bolsters, axles, spokes, tongues,\r\nsandboards, hounds, felloes and reaches. Entire dump carts, except the\r\niron, are constructed of this wood. Furniture manufacturers use it as\r\nframe material, but seldom as the outside visible parts, though no\r\nreason for not doing so is offered. Objection is made to its seasoning\r\nqualities, but the same objection applies to most red oaks. A\r\nconsiderable amount of water oak is cut in the South into thick planks\r\nfor bridge floors. It is strong and hard, and satisfactorily resists\r\ndecay in that place; though, in common with the black oaks generally, it\r\nis liable to decay when exposed to dampness. The wood weighs a little\r\nless than white oak, and is not quite as strong or as stiff. It is\r\nporous, but the pores are small, except one or two rows in the\r\nspringwood. The medullary rays are thin and not numerous, but they are\r\nconspicuous, and the wood may be successfully quarter-sawed. The lumber\r\nhas the appearance of red oak, though the reddish color is not so\r\npronounced.\r\n\r\n    BARTRAM OAK (_Quercus heterophylla_). This interesting but\r\n    commercially unimportant oak was named by Michaux from a single tree\r\n    found in a field belonging to John Bartram near Philadelphia more\r\n    than a century ago. A few trees have since been found in widely\r\n    scattered districts as far south as North Carolina and as far west\r\n    as Texas. Botanists believe it is a hybrid, one parent being the\r\n    willow oak (_Quercus phellos_) and the other yellow oak (_Quercus\r\n    velutina_). It is probable that here may be witnessed the origin of\r\n    a tree species. The leaves seem to be a compromise between the\r\n    deeply cut foliage of yellow oak and the entire leaf of willow oak.\r\n    The new species is so scarce that few people have ever seen it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRED GUM\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RED GUM]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRED GUM\r\n\r\n(_Liquidambar Styraciflua_)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis tree does not belong to the same group as black gum and tupelo,\r\nwhich are in the dogwood family, while red gum is of the witch hazel\r\nfamily. If a tree is to be judged and named by its character, red gum is\r\nmore entitled to the name “gum” than any other tree of this country,\r\nbecause it exudes a yellow resin from wounds in the bark. The botanical\r\nname recognizes that fact. Storax is procured from a closely related\r\ntree is Asia, and has been known in commerce for many centuries. The\r\nother popular names of red gum are sweet gum, liquid-amber gum, gum\r\ntree, alligator wood, bilsted, starleaved gum, and satin walnut.\r\n\r\nThe last name originated in England where it was desirable to avoid the\r\nname gum when applied to the wood of this tree. Though botanically it is\r\nabout as distantly related to walnut as any tree can be, the figure of\r\nthe wood often suggests walnut. The name sweet gum refers to the\r\npleasant odor of the resin which is sometimes used in France, and\r\nprobably elsewhere, to perfume gloves. Alligator wood is descriptive of\r\nwarty excrescences on the bark of some trees, but they are not common to\r\nall. Starleaved gum relates to the leaf. It is a lopsided star--a six\r\npoint star with one point missing.\r\n\r\nThis tree’s range in the United States extends from Connecticut to Texas\r\nand as far northwest of the Alleghanies as Missouri and Illinois. It\r\nreaches its greatest size in the lower Mississippi valley in rich bottom\r\nland which is subject to repeated inundation. It is not, however, as\r\npurely a swamp tree as tupelo and cypress. It grows well on land which\r\nis never inundated, but it needs plenty of moisture. The largest\r\nspecimens exceed a height of 120 feet and a diameter of four; but logs\r\nfrom eighteen inches to three feet are the usual sizes. The tree’s range\r\nextends southward through Mexico into Central America.\r\n\r\nThe rise of red gum lumber into prominence forms an interesting chapter\r\nin the industry. It was formerly considered so difficult to season that\r\nfew mills cared to deal with it, but that difficulty has been largely\r\novercome. In the past, gum, having no market value, was left standing\r\nafter logging; or, where the land was cleared for farming, was girdled\r\nand allowed to rot, and then felled and burned. Not only were the trees\r\na total loss to the farmer, but, from their great size and the labor\r\nrequired to handle them, they were so serious an obstruction as often to\r\npreclude the clearing of valuable land. Now that there is a market for\r\nthe timber, it is profitable to cut gum with other hardwoods, and land\r\ncan be cleared more cheaply. This increase in the value of gum timber\r\nwill be of great benefit to the South in many ways.\r\n\r\nThroughout its entire life red gum is intolerant of shade. As a rule\r\nseedlings appear only in clearings or in open spots in the forest. It is\r\nseldom that an overtopped tree is found, for the gum dies quickly if\r\nsuppressed, and is consequently nearly always a dominant or intermediate\r\ntree. In a hardwood bottom forest, the timber trees are all of nearly\r\nthe same age over considerable areas, and there is little young growth\r\nto be found in the older stands. The reason for this is the intolerance\r\nof most of the swamp species.\r\n\r\nRed gum reproduces both by seed and by sprouts, fairly abundantly every\r\nyear, but about once in three years there is a heavy production. In the\r\nMississippi valley the abandoned fields on which young stands of red gum\r\nhave sprung up are, for the most part, being rapidly cleared again. The\r\nsecond growth here is considered of little worth in comparison with the\r\nvalue of the land for agricultural purposes.\r\n\r\nA large amount of red gum growing in the South can be economically\r\ntransported from the forests to the mills only by means of the streams,\r\nowing to the expense of putting in railroads solely for handling the\r\ntimber. Green red gum, however, is so heavy that it scarcely floats and,\r\nto overcome this difficulty, various methods of driving out the sap\r\nbefore the logs are thrown into the river have been tried. One method is\r\nto girdle the trees and leave them standing a year. That partly seasons\r\nthem, but does not give time for the sapwood to decay. The logs from\r\nsuch trees float readily, and the swamps and streams are utilized to\r\ncarry the logs to the mills.\r\n\r\nSome years ago that method of seasoning red gum was extensively\r\nadvertised in England by contractors who sold paving blocks of this\r\nwood. It was claimed that the common defects of red gum were thus\r\novercome. Large sales of paving material were made, particularly in\r\nLondon, and red gum was popular for a time, but it finally lost its hold\r\nas a paving wood in competition with certain Australian woods. The\r\ntheory that by girdling a tree and allowing it to die, the amount of\r\nheartwood will be increased has been abandoned. In selecting trees for\r\ncutting, those with doty tops, rotten stumps, and heavy bark,\r\nindications of an old tree which contains a very small proportion of\r\nsapwood, are now chosen. These are found mainly in the drier localities.\r\nIn low, wet places the trees have more sapwood and are smaller. The\r\nheartwood forms while the tree is living, not after it dies.\r\n\r\nThe rapidity with which red gum has come into use in this country and\r\nelsewhere is the best evidence of the wood’s real value. Its range of\r\nuses extends from the most common articles, such as boxes and crates, to\r\nthose of highest class, like furniture and interior finish. It is only\r\nmoderately strong and stiff, and is not a competitor of hickory, ash,\r\nmaple, and oak in vehicle manufacturing and other lines where strength\r\nor elasticity is demanded; but in nearly all other classes of wood uses,\r\nred gum has made itself a place. It has pushed to the front in spite of\r\nprejudice. As soon as the difficulties of seasoning were mastered, its\r\nvictory was won. Its annual use in Michigan, the home and center of\r\nhardwood supply, exceeds 20,000,000 feet in manufactured articles,\r\nexclusive of what is employed in rough form. In Illinois, the most\r\nextensive wood-manufacturing state in the Union, red gum stands second\r\nin amount among the hardwoods, the only one above it being white oak. In\r\nKentucky, only white oak and hickory are more important among the\r\nfactory woods, while in Arkansas, where the annual amount of this wood\r\nin factories exceeds 100,000,000 feet, it heads the list of hardwoods.\r\n\r\nAs a veneer material, it is demanded in four times the quantity of any\r\nother species. The veneer is nearly all rotary cut, and it goes into\r\ncheap and expensive commodities, from berry crates to pianos.\r\n\r\nThe wood weighs 36.83 pounds per cubic foot. It is straight-grained, the\r\nmedullary rays are numerous but not prominent, the pores diffuse but\r\nsmall, and the summerwood forms only a narrow band, like a line. The\r\nannual rings do not produce much figure, but wood has another kind of\r\nfigure, the kind that characterizes English and Circassian walnuts,\r\nsmoky, cloudy, shaded series of rings, independent of the growth rings.\r\nThey have no definite width or constant color, but the color is usually\r\ndeeper than the body of the wood. This figure is one of the most prized\r\nproperties of red gum. It is that which makes the wood the closest known\r\nimitator of Circassian walnut.\r\n\r\nAll red gum is not figured, and that which is figured may be worked in a\r\nway to conceal or make little use of the figure. It shows best in rotary\r\ncut veneer and tangentially sawed lumber. Various woods are imitated\r\nwith red gum. It is stained or painted to look like oak, cherry,\r\nmahogany, and even maple.\r\n\r\nSome trees have thin sapwood, and others are all sapwood. This\r\npeculiarity sometimes leads to misunderstandings in lumber transactions.\r\nA buyer specifies red gum, expecting to get red heartwood, but the\r\nseller delivers lumber cut from the red gum tree, though light colored\r\nsapwood may predominate. Properly speaking, the name is applied to the\r\ntree as a whole and does not refer to any particular color of wood in\r\nthe tree. The term “red” is said to have referred originally to the\r\ncolor of autumn leaves, and not to the wood.\r\n\r\nThe fruit of red gum is a bur, midway in appearance and size between the\r\nsycamore ball and the chestnut bur. It hangs on the tree until late in\r\nwinter. The resin which exudes from wounds in the bark is of much\r\ncommercial importance and is shipped from New Orleans and Mexican ports.\r\nNear the northern limit of the species’ range the trees yield little\r\nresin, but it is abundant farther south. In the southern states it is\r\nused locally as chewing gum. It is known commercially as copalm balm.\r\n\r\n    WITCH HAZEL (_Hamamelis virginiana_) is a cousin to red gum, but\r\n    there is small resemblance. It is known as winter bloom, snapping\r\n    hazel, and spotted alder. Its range extends from Nova Scotia to\r\n    Nebraska, Texas, and Florida. It reaches its largest size among the\r\n    southern Appalachian mountains where the extreme height is sometimes\r\n    forty feet, with a diameter of eighteen inches; but few people have\r\n    ever seen a witch hazel that large. It is usually fifteen or twenty\r\n    feet high and three or four inches in diameter. The wood is much\r\n    like that of red gum, being diffuse-porous with obscure medullary\r\n    rays, and a thin line of summerwood. It is of little commercial use;\r\n    in fact, no report has been found that a single foot of it has ever\r\n    been used for any purpose. Yet it is a most interesting little tree.\r\n    It blooms in the fall, sometimes as late as the middle of November.\r\n    Its rusty summer foliage turns yellow in autumn, and as the leaves\r\n    begin to fall, the tree bursts into delicately-scented golden\r\n    flowers, the most visible part of each consisting of four petals\r\n    which float out like streamers. At the same time that flowers are\r\n    scenting the air, the seeds are discharging. A full year is required\r\n    to ripen them; and when dry, cold weather comes, the contraction of\r\n    their envelopes shoots them with sufficient force to send them\r\n    fifteen or twenty feet. They depend on neither wings, birds, nor\r\n    squirrels to scatter them. The origin of the name witch hazel is\r\n    disputed; but the person who examines the open-topped button which\r\n    holds the black seeds, and notes the fantastic resemblance to a\r\n    weasen face, will feel satisfied that he can guess the origin of the\r\n    name. The tree’s bark is used for medicine, in extracts and gargles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBLACK GUM\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BLACK GUM]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBLACK GUM\r\n\r\n(_Nyssa Sylvatica_)\r\n\r\n\r\nBlack gum grows from the Kennebec river in Maine to Tampa bay, Florida;\r\nwestward to southern Ontario and southern Michigan; Southward through\r\nMissouri, as far as the Brazos river in Texas. The names by which it is\r\nknown in different regions are black gum, sour gum, tupelo, pepperidge,\r\nwild pear tree, gum, and yellow gum.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of black gum are simple and alternate; not serrate. They are\r\nattached by very short petioles, which are fuzzy when young; they are a\r\nrich, brilliant green above and lighter below; rather thick, with\r\nprominent midrib. As early as the latter part of August the leaves\r\ncommence to turn a gorgeous red. The flowers are greenish and\r\ninconspicuous, growing in thick clusters, the staminate ones small and\r\nplentiful, the pistillate ones larger. They bloom in April, May or June.\r\nThe fruit of black gum is a drupe about one and a half inches long;\r\ninside of it is a rough, oval pit; the pulp is acrid until mellowed by\r\nfrost.\r\n\r\nThe bad name given to black gum by early settlers of this country has\r\nstayed with it, though the faults found with it then, should hold no\r\nlonger. The pioneers were nearly all clearers of farms. They went into\r\nthe woods with ax, maul, mattock, wedges and gluts, and made fields and\r\nfenced them. The fencing was as important as the clearing, for the woods\r\nwere alive with hogs, cattle, and horses, and the crop was safe nowhere\r\nexcept behind an eight-rail staked and ridered fence. The farmer mauled\r\nthe rails from timber which he cut in the clearing, and there it was\r\nthat he and black gum got acquainted. The oak, chestnut, walnut, cherry,\r\nyellow poplar, and red cedar were split into rails and built into\r\nfences; but black gum never made a fence rail. No combination of maul,\r\nwedge, glut, determination, and elbow grease ever split a black gum log\r\nwithin the borders of the American continent. An iron wedge, driven to\r\nits head in the end of a rail cut, will not open a crack large enough to\r\ninsert the point of a pocket knife. In fact, it is as easy to split the\r\nlog crosswise as endwise. Consequently, the early farmers heaped their\r\nanathemas and maranathas on black gum and passed it by.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the tree had its virtues even in the eyes of the\r\nrail-splitters; for, though it was unwedgeable, it helped along the\r\nfence rail industry in a very substantial way by furnishing the material\r\nof which mauls were made. It drove the wedges and gluts which opened\r\nother timbers. About the only maul that would beat out more rails than\r\none of black gum was that made of a chestnut oak knot. The oak beetle’s\r\nonly advantage over gum was that it was harder and wore longer. So\r\ninvolved and interlaced are the fibers of black gum, that they cross one\r\nanother not only at right angles, but at every conceivable angle. This\r\ncan be seen in examining very thin pieces with a magnifying glass.\r\n\r\nThe wood is not hard, but is moderately strong, and stiff. It has been\r\ncompared with hickory, but it is so inferior in almost every essential\r\nthat no comparison is justified.\r\n\r\nBlack gum weighs 39.61 pounds per cubic foot. It is very porous, but the\r\npores are too small to be seen by the naked eye, and are diffused\r\nthrough the wood and form no distinct lines or groups. The summerwood is\r\na thin dark line, not prominent enough to clearly delimit the yearly\r\nrings of growth. The medullary rays are numerous, but very thin. In\r\nquarter-sawed wood they produce a luster, but the individual rays are\r\npractically invisible. The wood is not durable in contact with the soil.\r\n\r\nThe standing tree is apt to fall a victim to the agencies of decay.\r\nHollow trunks, mere shells, are not uncommon. The entire heartwood is\r\nliable to fall away. The pioneers cut these hollow trees, and sawing\r\nthem in lengths of about two feet, made beehives of them. They called\r\nthem gums because they were cut from gum trees. Larger sizes, used in\r\nplace of barrels, were also called gums, but these were usually made\r\nfrom sycamores. The black gum is not usually large. Individuals have\r\nbeen measured that were five feet in diameter and more than a hundred in\r\nheight, but an average of sixty feet high and two in diameter is\r\nprobably too much, except in the southern Appalachian mountains where\r\nthe species attains its largest size.\r\n\r\nIt is a tree which will always be easily recognized after it has been\r\nseen and identified once. Its general outline, particularly when leaves\r\nare off, is different from other trees associated with it. It might\r\npossibly be mistaken for persimmon unless looked at closely; but there\r\nare easily-recognized points of difference. Its branches are very small,\r\nslender, and short. Its bark is rougher than that of any other gum, and\r\nis much darker in color. It is the bark’s color that gives the tree its\r\nname. The leaves have smooth edges. In the fall they change to gorgeous\r\nred, and one of their peculiarities is that half a leaf may be red while\r\nthe other half remains green. Toward the end of the season, the green\r\ndisappears. The dark blue drupes ripen in October. They do not seem to\r\nbe food for any living creature.\r\n\r\nSawmills include black gum with tupelo in reporting lumber cut, and\r\ngenerally call both of them gum without distinction. The woods are quite\r\ndifferent, and neither the standing tree nor the lumber of one need be\r\nmistaken for the other. The range of black gum is much more extensive\r\nthan that of tupelo. Gum lumber cut north of the Ohio and Potomac rivers\r\nmay be safely classed as black gum, though a little of both red and\r\ntupelo gum is found north of those streams. In the South, the species\r\ncannot be separated by regions, for all the gums grow from Texas to\r\nVirginia. The total annual output of black gum is not known, but some\r\noperators estimate it at about 20,000,000 feet a year, or nearly\r\none-fourth as much as tupelo.\r\n\r\nThe bulk of black gum lumber is used in the rough, for floors,\r\nsheathing, frames, and scaffolds; but a considerable portion is further\r\nmanufactured. The amounts thus used annually have been ascertained for a\r\nfew states, and furnish a basis for estimates for the whole country:\r\nMississippi, 7,000 feet; Maryland, 85,000; Illinois, 120,000; Louisiana,\r\n120,000; Missouri, 190,000; Texas, 360,000; Massachusetts, 475,000;\r\nAlabama, 486,000.\r\n\r\nThe uses are general, except that the wood is not employed where\r\nattractive figure is required, for black gum is as plain as cottonwood.\r\nIt is not displeasing in its plainness, for the surface finishes nicely\r\nwith a soft gloss which, except that it lacks figure, suggests the sap\r\nof red gum. It is specially useful in situations where noncleavability\r\nis required. Black gum mallets for stone masons and woodworkers are in\r\nthe market. Mine rollers require a much larger amount. The entire 85,000\r\nfeet reported in Maryland was made into such rollers. They furnish the\r\nbearing for the rope that hauls the car up the incline out of the coal\r\npit. Its toughness qualifies it for wagon hubs, but it is sometimes\r\nobjected to because its softness causes the mortises to wear larger\r\nwhere the spokes are inserted, and the wheel does not stand as well as\r\nwhen the hubs are of good oak. Early farmers and lumbermen preferred\r\nblack gum for ox yokes, and some are still seen where oxen are used; but\r\nmany other woods are as strong and equally as serviceable for yokes.\r\nRollers of this wood for glass factories are common. It is made into\r\nhatters’ blocks where a wood is wanted which, when thoroughly seasoned,\r\nwill hold its shape. It is less popular for this purpose than yellow\r\npoplar. One of the best places for black gum is in the manufacture of\r\nbored water pipe. The wood’s interlaced fiber prevents splitting under\r\nthe internal stress due to hydrostatic pressure. The shell of such pipes\r\ncan be thinner than with most woods. A drawback is found in the\r\nnon-durable qualities of black gum. However, the internal pressure of\r\nwater keeps the wood thoroughly saturated, and prolongs its life when\r\nused as pipes.\r\n\r\nThe makers of firearms employ black gum as gunstocks and pistol grips.\r\nThe wood is stained to make it darker. It is cut by the rotary process\r\ninto cheap veneer and is made into baskets and berry crates. Less\r\ntrouble with the veneer, on account of breaking, is experienced than\r\nmight be expected of a wood so cross-grained. It is sawed into thin\r\nlumber for boxes for shipping coffee and other groceries. It is a\r\nsubstitute for cottonwood and yellow poplar in the manufacture of\r\ncertain lines of woodenware, notably, ironing boards, rolling pins,\r\npotato mashers, and chopping bowls. It is made into interior finish for\r\nhouses; and furniture manufacturers find many places where it is a\r\nserviceable material. Musical instrument makers employ it, particularly\r\nas trusses for pianos, and in frames of pipe organs. In Louisiana it is\r\nconverted into excelsior, and in Mississippi into broom handles, and\r\nparts of agricultural implements, particularly hoppers and seedboxes.\r\n\r\nAll gums are hard to season, and this one is no exception. It checks\r\nbadly, but the checks are usually very small.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTUPELO\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TUPELO]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTUPELO\r\n\r\n(_Nyssa Aquatica_)\r\n\r\n\r\nTupelo is said to be an Indian name. White men have applied it to three\r\nspecies of gum, all of the same genus, namely, black gum (_Nyssa\r\nsylvatica_), sour tupelo (_Nyssa ogeche_), and tupelo (_Nyssa\r\naquatica_). Probably, the name tupelo applies as well to one as to the\r\nother, for it is said to refer to the drupe-like fruit; but custom\r\nconfines the name to the species now under consideration. It is largest\r\nof the three species, most abundant, and most important. Sour gum is\r\nheard in Arkansas and Missouri, swamp tupelo in South Carolina and\r\nLouisiana, cotton gum in the two Carolinas and Florida, wild olive tree\r\nin Louisiana, and olive tree in Mississippi.\r\n\r\nThe range of tupelo extends from Virginia along the coast to Florida,\r\nnorthward in the Mississippi valley to southern Illinois, and westward\r\nto Arkansas and Texas. It prefers swamps and attains largest size in low\r\nground which is subject to frequent overflow. The tree will stand in\r\nseveral feet of water the greater part of the year without injury. It is\r\nclosely associated with cypress, the planer tree, and other species\r\nwhich grow in deep swamps.\r\n\r\nTupelo has not figured much in tree literature outside the books of\r\nbotanists. Travelers and local writers have paid it little attention. It\r\nhas not been remarkable for anything in the past, and has escaped\r\nobservation to a large extent because it grows in swamps and along\r\nbayous, remote from the usual routes of travel. Its flowers attracted no\r\nattention, its fruit was worthless, and the early settlers did not put\r\nthemselves to trouble to procure the wood for any purpose. That was the\r\nsituation from the early settlement of the country where this species is\r\nfound up to a very recent period when economic conditions began to bring\r\ntupelo into notice.\r\n\r\nIt first attracted attention in the markets as a substitute for yellow\r\npoplar. That was brought about by an attempt to pass it as poplar. The\r\ngrowing scarcity of that wood in the region about Chesapeake bay led to\r\nthe trial of tupelo. It was sold as bay poplar, and the purchaser was\r\nleft to infer that it was poplar cut in the region tributary to\r\nChesapeake bay. Probably few buyers were deceived, but they found the\r\nwood a fair substitute for the yellow poplar which they had been\r\npurchasing in the Baltimore and Norfolk markets. It is known as bay\r\npoplar yet in many localities. It goes to England as such. One of its\r\nmost important uses in that country is as casing for electric wire\r\nfittings. It has, however, many other important uses in England and on\r\nthe continent. It is claimed that it may be stained to imitate\r\nCircassian walnut in the manufacture of furniture. This is possible, but\r\nmost probably tupelo has been confused with red gum which is a\r\nwell-known substitute for Circassian walnut.\r\n\r\nTupelo trees attain a height from seventy to a hundred feet, and a\r\ndiameter of two to four feet above the swelled base. The general\r\nappearance of the bark suggests both yellow poplar and red gum. Trees\r\nhave a habit of forking near the tops. The leaves are five or seven\r\ninches long, sometimes with smooth margins, and often with a few sharp\r\npoints. Flowers appear in March and April, and fruit ripens early in\r\nAutumn. It is a dark purple, tough-skinned drupe, about an inch long.\r\n\r\nThe wood weighs 32.37 pounds per cubic foot. It is soft, and has about\r\nthree-fourths the strength and little more than half the stiffness of\r\nwhite oak. It is not well suited to places where strength and rigidity\r\nare required. The fibers are interwoven, making the wood difficult to\r\nsplit. The heart is brown, often nearly white; the sapwood is very\r\nthick; and the annual rings are not clearly defined, because of the\r\nsimilarity between the springwood and summerwood. The pores are small\r\nbut numerous, and are scattered evenly through the whole annual ring.\r\nThe wood of roots differs from that of the trunk more than is usual with\r\nhardwoods. It is very light, and has been long employed in the South as\r\na substitute for cork as floats for fish nets.\r\n\r\nTupelo is often logged with cypress. The two trees grow in close\r\nassociation in deep swamps. The butt cuts of tupelo are so heavy that\r\nthey float deep, or even go to the bottom. It was formerly customary,\r\nand still is to some extent, to girdle trees whose trunks were to be\r\nfloated to the mills. In the course of one season the standing trees dry\r\nsufficiently for the logs to float. At other times, trees are cut green,\r\nthe logs are skidded and allowed to dry some months before they are\r\nrafted or floated to the mills. The sapwood is liable to decay, even in\r\nthe brief period while the logs are on the skids. The wood may be\r\nprotected against decay to some extent by smearing the ends of the logs\r\nwith tar or some other substance which prevents the spores of\r\ndecay-producing fungus from entering.\r\n\r\nThe seasoning of tupelo was formerly a problem exceedingly vexatious to\r\nthe lumberman. The wood is full of water, and warping was one of the\r\ntroubles which was constantly encountered. Finally experience gained the\r\nmastery, and seasoning troubles are fewer now. Shrinkage of four or five\r\nper cent is not unusual in passing lumber from the green to dry state.\r\n\r\nTupelo is like hickory in one respect--factories use more wood than the\r\nsawmills cut. The shops and manufacturing plants of ten states use as\r\nmuch tupelo as is cut by all the sawmills in the United States. These\r\nstates are Alabama, Arkansas, Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan,\r\nMississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, and Texas. The reason for factory\r\nuse exceeding the sawmill cut is that much reaches factories, in the\r\nform of veneer, which does not pass through a sawmill. The lumber output\r\nof most of the timber trees of this country is from one-third to\r\none-half greater than the factory use. The difference represents the\r\nrough lumber used, and which never goes to a factory.\r\n\r\nTupelo lately entered the general market, but the yearly demand now\r\nexceeds 100,000,000 feet. Its uses range from boxes and cheap handles to\r\ninterior finish and material for musical instruments. It is particularly\r\nliked for containers for berries and small fruits, on their way to\r\nmarket. Its whiteness and clean appearance fit it for that use.\r\n\r\nHigher grades of shipping boxes are also made. Wholesale grocers order\r\nlargely of this wood for spice, coffee, and tea boxes. These commodities\r\nare exacting in their requirements because their odor, which is often\r\nregarded as the criterion of their value, must not be impaired. A wood\r\nwith an odor of its own is immediately ruled out. Cigar box makers use\r\ntupelo, sometimes as thin lumber for the whole box, but usually as\r\nbacking over which to lay a thin veneer of Spanish cedar. Plug tobacco\r\nboxes are also made of tupelo.\r\n\r\nIn Illinois and Michigan tupelo is listed among woods manufactured into\r\npianos, organs, mandolins, and guitars. In Maryland they make scows and\r\nbarges of it. In Arkansas and Louisiana it is worked into excelsior and\r\nslack cooperage stock. It is a favorite wood in Mississippi for pumplogs\r\nand broom handles. Its leading reported use in Texas is for porch\r\ncolumns. In Missouri it is manufactured into laundry appliances, such as\r\nwashboards, clothes racks, and ironing boards. In nearly all\r\nmanufacturing centers of the country it is made into furniture and\r\ninterior finish. It is frequently substituted for yellow poplar in\r\npanels, not only in furniture and cabinet work, but in carriage bodies.\r\n\r\nThe supply of tupelo in southern forests is fairly large, and will meet\r\ndemand for some years, but it is a tree of slow growth, and when present\r\nstands are cut, a new supply will probably never come.\r\n\r\n    SOUR TUPELO (_Nyssa ogeche_) appears to be the only member of the\r\n    gum group whose fruit is of any value to man, and it is not very\r\n    important. The large, dull red drupes ripen in July and August, and\r\n    sometimes hang on the trees until late fall, allowing ample time for\r\n    gathering them. They are very sour, for which reason the tree is\r\n    called sour gum. The fruit is put through a pickling process which\r\n    renders it palatable and it is not an infrequent article on southern\r\n    pantry shelves. The range of the tree is confined to the region near\r\n    the coast from the southern border of South Carolina, through the\r\n    Ogeechee river valley in Georgia, to northern and western Florida.\r\n    The botanical name refers to the river along whose course the trees\r\n    are most abundant. Local names are gopher plum, Ogeechee lime, and\r\n    wild lime. The tree is sixty or seventy feet high, one or two in\r\n    diameter, and is often divided in several stems. Its wood is\r\n    lightest of the gums, weighing only 28.75 pounds per cubic foot. It\r\n    is diffuse-porous, and the springwood is scarcely distinguishable\r\n    from the summerwood. The annual rings of growth are indistinct, and\r\n    the medullary rays are thin and inconspicuous. The wood is weak,\r\n    soft, tough, and white, and little difference is apparent between\r\n    heart and sapwood. The flowers are rich in honey and are valuable to\r\n    bee keepers. It appears that no reports exist of the use of this\r\n    wood for any purpose. It is not abundant anywhere.\r\n\r\n    WATER GUM (_Nyssa biflora_) is a member of the gum group, and is of\r\n    small importance. Trees above thirty feet high are unusual, and the\r\n    trunk is of poor form, owing to its greatly enlarged base. This gum\r\n    is found on the margins of small ponds in the pine barrens from\r\n    North Carolina to the Gulf coast. The leaves turn purple and red in\r\n    the fall, and are then conspicuous objects. The fruit is a blue\r\n    drupe about a third of an inch long. The wood is light, tough, and\r\n    difficult to split.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBLACK WALNUT\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BLACK WALNUT]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBLACK WALNUT\r\n\r\n(_Juglans Nigra_)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis tree has few names. It is called walnut, black walnut, and\r\nwalnut-tree. The color of the wood and bark is responsible for the word\r\nblack in the name, though some people use the adjective to distinguish\r\nthe tree from butternut which is often known as white walnut. The\r\nnatural range of black walnut covers 600,000 or 700,000 square miles,\r\nand it has been extended by planting. Its northern limit stretches from\r\nNew York to Minnesota, its southern from Florida to Texas. It is\r\ndifficult to say where the species found its highest development in the\r\nprimeval forests, for very large trees were reported in New York, among\r\nthe southern Appalachian mountains, in the Ohio valley, and beyond the\r\nMississippi in Arkansas, Oklahoma, Missouri, and Kansas. The wood cut in\r\nOhio and Indiana has been of greater commercial importance than that\r\nfrom any other portion of its range, but that has been due, in part, to\r\nthe fact that it came into market before the best of the forest growth\r\nhad been destroyed in those states, and instead of burning it or mauling\r\nit into rails, as eastern farmers did in early times, the farmers of the\r\nOhio valley sold their walnut. Early in the history of black walnut\r\nlumbering, Indiana and Ohio came to the front as the most important\r\nsources of supply, and they still hold that position, notwithstanding\r\nthe original forests of those states were supposed to be nearly\r\nexhausted long ago. The states cutting most black walnut in 1910, in the\r\norder named, were Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee,\r\nMissouri, West Virginia, Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Iowa.\r\n\r\nDuring the period from 1860 to 1880 black walnut was in much demand for\r\nfurniture, and the largest yearly cut was 125,000,000 feet. It was\r\nduring that period of twenty years that operators pushed into all of the\r\nout-of-the-way places in search of the timber. Logs were hauled on\r\nwagons long distances to bring them out of remote valleys and slopes\r\nwhere no timber buyer had ever gone before. The walnut buyers made such\r\na thorough canvas of the country that it was generally supposed no\r\nmerchantable tree from Kansas to Virginia would escape. Many a dooryard\r\ngiant whose wide branches had shaded the family roof for generations,\r\nfell before the ax of the contractor who was willing to pay fifty\r\ndollars for a single trunk, though it might be twenty miles from the\r\nnearest railroad or navigable stream. In spite of the thoroughness of\r\nthe search, many a walnut tree was spared. Logs have been going to\r\nmarket ever since, and still they go. They will continue to go for\r\nyears, generations, and centuries; for walnut trees grow with rapidity.\r\n\r\nThe trunk’s value increases with age. The dark colored heartwood only is\r\nmerchantable, and young trees have little heartwood. The thick, white\r\nsap constitutes most of the trunk until long after the tree has reached\r\nsmall sawlog size. Then the transformation to the dark, valuable\r\nheartwood goes on with fair rapidity, and the outer shell of sapwood\r\nbecomes thinner as the heart increases, and in time a trunk is produced\r\nwhich is fit for good logs. Value comes only with age. The quarter or\r\nhalf a century which has passed since the country was so diligently\r\nransacked for merchantable walnut, has been sufficient to develop many a\r\ntree which was then rejected by the purchasers. Many a tree now a foot\r\nin diameter had scarcely sprouted then. In a region of 700,000 square\r\nmiles, walnut trees do not need to grow very close together to produce a\r\nyearly cut of 30,000,000 or 40,000,000 feet.\r\n\r\nBlack walnut is valuable for its color, figure, and the fine polish it\r\ntakes. It is stronger than white oak, weight for weight, but it is eight\r\npounds lighter per cubic foot. The figure of the wood is due wholly to\r\nthe annual rings, as its medullary rays are invisible to the naked eye.\r\nThe wood is very porous, and the pores are diffused in all parts of the\r\nannual rings, except in the thin, pencil-like mark representing the\r\noutward boundary of the summerwood. When sapwood changes to heartwood,\r\nsome of the pores disappear, but those which remain are abundantly\r\nsufficient to absorb any stains or fillers which the wood finisher may\r\nwish to apply.\r\n\r\nThe annual sawmill cut of black walnut in the United States is from\r\n35,000,000 to 40,000,000 feet, but much goes to foreign countries in the\r\nlog, and a considerable quantity goes to veneer mills--about 2,500,000\r\nfeet a year--and a quantity finds its way to various factories where it\r\nis worked up without any statistical record being made of it.\r\n\r\nBlack walnut is never used as rough lumber. It all goes to factories of\r\nsome kind to be converted into finished commodities. It is not possible\r\nto say where it all goes, for statistics of manufacture are fragmentary\r\nin this country. It may be of interest to know that demand for walnut by\r\nfactories in the following states was 11,641,137 feet in 1910: Alabama,\r\nArkansas, Illinois, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Missouri, North\r\nCarolina, and Texas. The wood served so many purposes that a list of\r\nthem would be monotonous. In Illinois the largest users are the sewing\r\nmachine and the musical instrument industries; in Michigan the makers of\r\nautomobiles and of musical instruments; in Kentucky the manufacturers of\r\ncoffins, furniture, and musical instruments; in Massachusetts, the\r\nmakers of furniture and of firearms. These uses probably afford a fairly\r\naccurate index for the whole country. During the Civil war the largest\r\ndemand for walnut came from gunstock makers. Doubtless the largest use\r\nfrom 1865 to 1885 was for furniture.\r\n\r\nMuch of the best black walnut is exported. The logs are flattened on the\r\nfour sides to make them fit better in ships and cars, and also to be rid\r\nof most of the sapwood which is valueless. The ends are painted with red\r\nlead or some other substance to lessen liability to check. Sometimes\r\nexport walnut is sawed in thick planks.\r\n\r\nLarge quantities of old-time walnut furniture have been resurrected in\r\nrecent years from granary and garret where it was stored long ago to\r\nhave it out of the way. Some of the old beds, lounges, cupboards, and\r\nchairs were of heavy, solid walnut, the kind not made now. Some of it\r\nhas been furbished, re-upholstered, and set among the heirlooms; other\r\npieces have been sold to furniture makers who saw the solid wood in\r\nveneers, and use it again.\r\n\r\nThe search for old walnut did not stop with dragging antique furniture\r\nfrom cubbyholes and attics, but two-inch lumber has been pulled from\r\nfloors of old barns, and mills. Many old fence rails were made into gun\r\nstocks during the Civil war. Later, walnut stumps were pulled from field\r\nand wayside, and went to veneer mills. Some finely figured wood comes\r\nfrom stumps where roots and trunk join.\r\n\r\nAn occasional walnut tree develops a large burl which is valued for its\r\nfigured wood. Sometimes the burl is the form of a door knob, with the\r\ntree trunk growing through the center. The burl sometimes has a diameter\r\nthree or four times as great as the trunk. The origin of such burls is\r\nsupposed to be a mass of buds which fail to break through the bark.\r\n\r\nBlack walnut has a compound leaf from one to two feet long, with from\r\nfifteen to twenty-three leaflets, each about three inches long and an\r\ninch or two wide. The nuts ripen in the fall, and are valuable. They are\r\nborne chiefly by trees growing in open ground; forest trees do not bear\r\nuntil old, and then only a few nuts. The walnuts which germinate are\r\nusually those buried by squirrels, and forgotten.\r\n\r\nWithin the past twenty or thirty years plantations have been made in\r\nstates of the Middle West. Many young planted trees have been cut for\r\nfence posts, with disappointing results. It was known that old walnut is\r\ndurable, and it was supposed young trunks would be, when used for posts;\r\nbut young trees are nearly all sapwood which rots quickly.\r\n\r\nForest grown walnut trees vary in size from a diameter of two feet and a\r\nheight of fifty, to a diameter of six or more and a height of 100 or\r\n120. Trunks which grow in the shade are tall, clear, and symmetrical;\r\nthose in the open are shorter, with more taper.\r\n\r\n    PALE-LEAF HICKORY (_Hicoria villosa_) is a small tree but large\r\n    enough to be useful wherever it exists in sufficient quantity. The\r\n    largest specimens attain a height of fifty feet and a diameter of\r\n    eighteen inches. The tree bears nuts when very small, and the kernel\r\n    is sweet. The bark of this hickory is rough but not shaggy. The\r\n    range extends from New Jersey to Florida and west to Missouri and\r\n    Texas. It is most abundant in the lower Appalachian ranges. The wood\r\n    possesses the common characteristics of the hickories, and it is cut\r\n    with them wherever it is found, but is seldom or never reported\r\n    separately in lumber operations.\r\n\r\n    SMALL PIGNUT HICKORY (_Hicoria odorata_) is considered a species by\r\n    some botanists while others regard it as a variety. It is called\r\n    small pignut in Maryland, and occasionally little shagbark. This\r\n    last name refers to the roughness of the bark which resembles the\r\n    bark of elm. The range of the tree extends from Massachusetts to\r\n    Missouri and south to the Ohio and the Potomac rivers. The wood\r\n    differs little from that of pignut hickory, and the uses are the\r\n    same. No distinction is made between them at the shop and factory.\r\n    This tree is by some botanists believed to be a hybrid between\r\n    shagbark and pignut. It is sometimes called false shagbark. The nut\r\n    is edible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBUTTERNUT\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BUTTERNUT]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBUTTERNUT\r\n\r\n(_Juglans Cinerea_)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis tree is known as butternut or as white walnut in all parts of its\r\nrange. Butternut is in reference to the oily kernel of the nuts, and\r\nwhite walnut is the name given by those who would distinguish the tree\r\nfrom black walnut. Persons acquainted with one of the species in its\r\nnative woods are usually sure to be acquainted with the other, for their\r\nranges are practically co-extensive, except that black walnut extends\r\nfarther southwest, butternut farther northeast. Butternut grows from New\r\nBrunswick to South Dakota, from Delaware to Arkansas, and along the\r\nAppalachian highlands to northern Georgia and Alabama.\r\n\r\nButternut resembles black walnut in a good many ways and differs from it\r\nin several. They are very closely related botanically--as closely as are\r\nbrothers in the same household. Black walnut is larger, stronger, better\r\nknown, and has always dominated and eclipsed the other in usefulness and\r\npublic esteem; yet butternut is a tree both useful and interesting. No\r\nperson acquainted with both would ever mistake one for the other, winter\r\nor summer. Botanists tell how to distinguish butternut from black walnut\r\nby noting minor differences. The person who is not a botanist needs no\r\nsuch help. He knows them at sight, and there is no possibility of\r\nmistaking them.\r\n\r\nButternut in the forest may attain a height of eighty or 100 feet, and a\r\ndiameter of three, but few persons ever see a specimen of that size, and\r\nnever in open ground. In shade, the butternut does its best to get its\r\ncrown up to light and sunshine, but it is weak. It often gives up the\r\nstruggle and remains in the shade of trees which overtop it. In that\r\nsituation its crown is small, thin, and appears to rest lightly in the\r\nform of a small bunch of yellowish-green leaves on the top of a tall,\r\nspindling bole, which is seldom straight, but is made up of slight,\r\nundulating curves. The pale, yellowish tinge of the bark suggests a\r\nplant deprived of sunshine.\r\n\r\nWhen butternut grows in open ground where light falls upon its crown and\r\non all sides, it assumes a different form and presents another figure.\r\nThe trunk is nearly as short as that of an apple tree. It divides in\r\nlarge branches and limbs, and these spread wide; leaves are healthy, yet\r\nthe crown of a butternut always looks thin compared with that of the\r\nblack walnut. Tests show that butternut wood, when thoroughly dry, is\r\nsomewhat stiffer than black walnut; but it is light and weak. It is\r\nabout two-thirds as heavy and two-thirds as strong as black walnut. The\r\ngrowing tree betrays the wood’s weakness. Large limbs snap in storms.\r\nTrees become lopsided, and a symmetrical, well-proportioned butternut\r\ncrown is an exception. The broken branches leave openings for the\r\nentrance of decay, and butternuts nearly always die of disease rather\r\nthan of old age.\r\n\r\nLeaves are compound, and from fifteen to thirty inches in length. Few\r\ntrees of this country have larger leaves. There are from eleven to\r\nseventeen leaflets. They are hairy and sticky. Hands that handle them\r\nare covered with mucilage-like substance. The nuts, which grow in\r\nclusters of three or five, are of the same color as the leaves and\r\ncovered with the same sticky fuzz. The nuts are two inches or more in\r\nlength, and are borne abundantly when trees stand in open ground. Size\r\nrather than age appears to determine the period when trees commence to\r\nbear. Those of extra vigor produce when ten or twelve years old. The\r\nnuts are salable in the market. They fall with the leaves, immediately\r\nafter the first sharp frost, and all come down together. A single day\r\nfrequently suffices to strip the last leaf from a tree, though some of\r\nthe nuts may hang a little longer. The kernels are very rich, when the\r\nnuts are dry, and are apt to cloy the appetite; but they are improved by\r\nfreezing where they lie on the ground among the leaves; but they must be\r\nused quickly after they thaw, or they will spoil. Nuts nearly full-grown\r\nbut not yet hard are made into pickles, but the fuzz must first be\r\nwashed off with hot water.\r\n\r\nButternut bark has played a rather important role in the country’s\r\naffairs. Doctors in the Revolutionary war made much of their medicine of\r\nthe roots and bark of this tree. Drugs were unattainable, and physicians\r\nwere forced to betake themselves to the woods for substitutes, and their\r\npharmacopoeias were enriched by the butternut tree. Housewives dyed\r\ncloth a brown color with this bark long before aniline dyes found their\r\nway into this country. Whole companies of Confederate soldiers from the\r\nmountain regions in the Civil war wore clothes dyed in decoctions of\r\nbutternut bark, and popularly known as “butternut jeans.”\r\n\r\nThe annual output of butternut lumber is placed at a little more than\r\n1,000,000 feet a year. It is widely used, but in small amounts. In\r\nMaryland it is made into ceiling and flooring; in North Carolina into\r\ncabinet work, fixtures for stores and offices, and into furniture; in\r\nMichigan its reported uses are boat finish, interior finish for houses,\r\nmolding, and screen frames. In Illinois it is used for all the purposes\r\nlisted above and also for church altars and car finish. These uses are\r\ndoubtless typical, and hold good in all parts of the country where any\r\nuse is made of butternut.\r\n\r\nThe wood has figure similar to that of black walnut, but the color is\r\nlighter. It is nearer brown than black. The pores are diffused through\r\nthe annual ring, but are more numerous and of larger size in the inner\r\nthan in the outer part. The springwood blends gradually with the wood of\r\nthe latter part of the season, without sharp distinction, but the ring\r\nterminates in a black line which is the chief element of contrast in the\r\nwood’s figure.\r\n\r\nThe future value of butternut will be less in the lumber than in the\r\nnuts. The tendency in that direction is now apparent. When land is\r\ncleared, the trees which would formerly have gone to the sawmill, are\r\nnow left to bear nuts. The averaged price paid by factories in North\r\nCarolina for butternut is $40 a thousand feet. It is cheaper in the Lake\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n    MEXICAN WALNUT (_Juglans rupestris_) will never amount to much as a\r\n    timber tree, though it is by no means useless. It is known by\r\n    several names, among them being western walnut, dwarf walnut, little\r\n    walnut, and California walnut. The last name is applied in Arizona\r\n    through a misunderstanding of the tree’s identity. It is there\r\n    confused with the California walnut which is a different species.\r\n    The Mexican walnut’s range extends from central Texas, through New\r\n    Mexico to Arizona, and southward into Mexico. It prefers the\r\n    limestone banks of streams in Texas where it is usually shrubby,\r\n    seldom attaining a height above thirty feet. It reaches its largest\r\n    size in canyons among the mountains of New Mexico and Arizona where\r\n    it reaches a height of sixty feet. Trunks are sometimes five feet in\r\n    diameter. The wood weighs 40.85 pounds per cubic foot, is dark in\r\n    color, but the tone is not as regular as that of black walnut;\r\n    neither is it as strong and stiff. It polishes well, and is said to\r\n    be durable in contact with the soil. It finds its way in small\r\n    amounts to local mills, shops, and factories where it is made into\r\n    various commodities. It is particularly liked for the lathe, and is\r\n    suited better for turnery than for any other purpose. It is made\r\n    into gavels, cups, spindles, parts of grills; and it is also worked\r\n    into picture frames, handles, and small pieces of furniture. It does\r\n    not appear that lumber sawed from this walnut ever gets into the\r\n    general market, but the whole output, which is small, is consumed\r\n    locally. Trees do not occur in pure stands and the whole supply\r\n    consists of isolated trees or small groups, with few trunks large\r\n    enough for sawlogs. The nuts are dwarfs. All are not the same size,\r\n    but none are as large as a hickory nut. Many that grow on the\r\n    diminutive trees along the water courses in western Texas are not as\r\n    large, husks and all, as a nutmeg, and the nut itself is about half\r\n    the size of a nutmeg, and not dissimilar in appearance. The kernels\r\n    of such a nut are too small to have any commercial value, but they\r\n    are rare morsels for the native Mexicans and Indians who pick them\r\n    by pocketfuls. Trees in the stony canyon of Devil’s river, in Texas,\r\n    are in full bearing when so small that a man can stand on the ground\r\n    and pick walnuts from their highest branches. The Mexican walnut is\r\n    occasionally cultivated in the eastern part of the United States and\r\n    in Europe. It is hardy as far north as Massachusetts.\r\n\r\n    CALIFORNIA WALNUT (_Juglans californica_) is a small tree confined\r\n    to California, and pretty close to the coast, though it grows in\r\n    Eldorado county. It is most abundant within twenty or thirty miles\r\n    of tidewater. In the southern part of the state it ascends to an\r\n    elevation of 4,000 feet. It prefers the banks of streams and the\r\n    bottoms of canyons where the soil is moist, but it will grow in dry\r\n    situations. Trees occur singly or in small groups. Their average\r\n    size is fifteen or twenty feet high, and eight or ten inches in\r\n    diameter; but trees occasionally are sixty feet high and eighteen\r\n    inches through. The leaves are small, measuring from six to nine\r\n    inches in length, with from nine to seventeen leaflets. Nuts are\r\n    about half the size of eastern black walnuts. The kernel is edible.\r\n    The wood is heavier than black walnut, and somewhat lighter in\r\n    color. Otherwise the two woods are much alike, except in strength\r\n    and stiffness. In these the California wood is inferior. It has not\r\n    been reported for any use, but it is suitable for a number of\r\n    purposes, provided logs of sufficient size could be had. The trunk,\r\n    in addition to being small, is usually short. The tree is intolerant\r\n    of shade, and is not often found in forests. It grows rapidly and\r\n    will attain a diameter of fifteen inches in twenty years or less;\r\n    but it apparently does not live long. Its principal usefulness in\r\n    California is as a shade tree, and as a stock in nurseries on which\r\n    to graft English walnut.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSHAGBARK HICKORY\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHAGBARK HICKORY]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSHAGBARK HICKORY\r\n\r\n(_Hicoria Ovata_)\r\n\r\n\r\nTwelve species of hickory grow in the United States, all east of the\r\nRocky Mountains. None grow anywhere else in the world, as far as known.\r\nThey were widely dispersed over the northern hemisphere in prehistoric\r\ntimes. The records of geology, written by leaf prints in the rocks, tell\r\nof forests of hickory in Europe, and even in Greenland, probably a\r\nhundred thousand or more years ago, and certainly not in times that can\r\nbe called recent. No records there later than the ice age have been\r\nfound. This leads to the presumption that the sheet of ice which pushed\r\ndown from the North and covered the larger portions of Europe and North\r\nAmerica, overwhelmed the hickory forests, and all others, as far as the\r\nsouthern limit of the ice’s advance.\r\n\r\nIn Europe the hickory was utterly destroyed, and it never returned after\r\nthe close of the reign of ice; but America was more fortunate. The ice\r\nsheet pushed little farther in its southward course than the Ohio and\r\nMissouri rivers, and forests south of there held their ground, and they\r\nslowly worked their way back north as the ice withdrew. Hickory\r\nrecovered part but not all of its lost ground in America, for it is now\r\nfound no farther north than southern Canada, which is more than a\r\nthousand miles from its old range in Greenland.\r\n\r\nThe early settlers in New England and in the South at once came into\r\ncontact with hickory. It was one of the first woods named in this\r\ncountry, and the name is of Indian origin, and is spelled in no fewer\r\nthan seventeen ways in early literature relating to the settlements. It\r\nis probable that John Smith, a prominent man in early Virginia and New\r\nEngland, was the first man who ever wrote the name. He spelled it as the\r\nIndians pronounced it, “powcohiscora,” and it has been trimmed down to\r\nour word hickory. The Indian word was the name of a salad or soup made\r\nof pounded hickory nuts and water, and was only indirectly applied to\r\nthe tree itself.\r\n\r\nThe first settlers along the Atlantic coast nearly always called this\r\ntree a walnut, and the name white walnut was common. They were\r\nunacquainted with any similar nut-bearing tree in Europe, except the\r\nwalnut, and most people preferred applying a name with which they were\r\nalready familiar. Hickories and walnuts belong to the same family, and\r\nhave many points in common.\r\n\r\nAlthough there are twelve hickories in the United States, and in many\r\nrespects they are similar, all are not of equal value. Some are very\r\nscarce, and the wood of others is not up to standard. From a commercial\r\nstandpoint, four surpass the others. These are shagbark (_Hicoria\r\novata_), shellbark (_Hicoria laciniosa_), pignut (_Hicoria glabra_), and\r\nmockernut (_Hicoria alba_). The wood of some of the others is as good,\r\nbut is scarce; and still others, particularly the pecans, are abundant\r\nenough, but the wood is inferior. It is impossible in business to\r\nseparate the hickories. Lumbermen do not do it; manufacturers cannot do\r\nit. In some regions one is more abundant than the others, and\r\nconsequently is used in larger quantities, but in some other region a\r\ndifferent species may predominate in the forest and in the factory. It\r\ncannot be truthfully asserted that one hickory is always as good as\r\nanother, or even that a certain species in one region is as good as the\r\nsame species in another region. All parts of the same tree do not\r\nproduce wood of equal value.\r\n\r\nAlong certain general lines, hickories have many properties in common.\r\nThe wood is ring-porous, that is, the inner edge of the yearly growth\r\nring has a row of large pores. Others are scattered toward the outer\r\npart of the ring, generally decreasing in number and size outward. There\r\nis no distinct division between spring and summerwood. The medullary\r\nrays are thin and obscure. The unaided eye seldom notices them. The\r\nsapwood is white in all species of hickory, and is usually very thick.\r\nThe heartwood is reddish. Common opinion has long held that sapwood is\r\ntougher and more elastic than heartwood, and therefore to be preferred\r\nfor most purposes. Tests made a few years ago by the United States\r\nForest Service ran counter to the long-established opinion of users, by\r\nshowing that in most respects the redwood of the heart was as good as\r\nthe white sapwood. However, where resiliency is the chief requisite, as\r\nin slender handles, many manufacturers still prefer sapwood.\r\n\r\nHickory is very strong, probably the strongest wood in common use in\r\nthis country. The statement that one wood is stronger than all others is\r\nhardly justified because averages of strength should be taken, and not\r\nisolated instances. Satisfactory averages have not yet been worked out\r\nfor a large number of our woods; but, as far as existing figures may be\r\naccepted, hickory is at the head of the list for strength, toughness,\r\nand resiliency. Choice samples of certain woods may exceed the average\r\nof hickory in some of these particulars. Sugar maple, hornbeam, and\r\nlocust occasionally show greater strength than hickory, but they lack in\r\ntoughness and resiliency--the very properties which give hickory its\r\nchief value for many purposes.\r\n\r\nConsiderable misunderstanding exists as to second growth hickory. Some\r\nsuppose it consists of trees of commercial size developed from sprouts\r\nwhere old trees have been cut. That is not generally correct. When\r\nsmall hickory trees are cut, the stumps often sprout, but hoop poles are\r\nabout the only commodity made from that kind of hickory. If sprouts are\r\nleft to grow large, the trees produced are generally defective. Good\r\nhickory grows from the nut. The term “second growth” means little,\r\nunless it is explained in each instance just what conditions are\r\nincluded. In one sense, all young, vigorous trees are second growth, and\r\nthat is often the idea in the mind of the speaker. Some would restrict\r\nit to trees which have come up in old fields or partial clearings, where\r\nthey have plenty of light, and have grown rapidly. Their trunks are\r\nshort, the wood is tough, and there is little red heartwood. The larger\r\na pine, oak, or poplar, provided it is sound, the better the wood; but\r\nnot so with hickory. Great age and large size add no desirable qualities\r\nto this wood.\r\n\r\nShagbark is largest of the true hickories. The pecans are not usually\r\nregarded as true hickories from the wood-user’s viewpoint. Some\r\nshagbarks are 120 feet high and four feet in diameter, but the average\r\nsize is about seventy-five tall, two in diameter. There is confusion of\r\nnames among all the hickories, and shagbark is misnamed and over-named\r\nas often as any of the others. Many persons do not know shagbark and\r\nshellbark apart, though the ranges of the two species lie only partly in\r\nthe same territory. Shagbark is known as shellbark hickory, shagbark\r\nhickory, shellbark, upland hickory, hickory, scaly bark hickory, white\r\nwalnut, walnut, white hickory, and red heart hickory. Most of the names\r\nrefer to the bark, which separates into thin strips, often a foot or\r\nmore long, and six inches or more wide; and this remains more or less\r\nclosely attached to the trunk by the middle, giving the shaggy\r\nappearance to which the tree owes its common name.\r\n\r\nThe leaf-buds are large and ovate, with yellowish-green and brown\r\nscales. The leaves are compound and alternate; they have rough stalks\r\ncontaining five or seven leaflets; they are sessile, tapering to a point\r\nand having a rounded base. The lower pair of leaflets is markedly\r\ndifferent from the rest in shape; sharply serrate and thin; dark green\r\nand glabrous above; lighter below. The flowers do not appear until the\r\nleaves have fully matured. They grow in catkins; the staminate ones are\r\nlight green, slender, and grow in groups of three on long peduncles; the\r\npistillate ones grow in spikes of from two to five flowers. The fruit\r\ngrows within a dense, green husk, shiny and smooth on the outside,\r\nopening in four parts. The nut is nearly white, four-angled, and\r\nflattened at the sides. The kernel is sweet and of a strong flavor.\r\n\r\nThis tree’s range is not much short of 1,000,000 square miles, but it is\r\nnot equally abundant in all parts. It grows from southern Maine to\r\nwestern Florida; is found in Minnesota and Nebraska, and southward\r\nbeyond the Mississippi. It is most common and of largest size on the\r\nwestern slopes of the southern Appalachian mountains and in the basin of\r\nthe lower Ohio river. Its favorite habitat is on low hills, or near\r\nstreams and swamps, in rich and moderately well drained soil.\r\n\r\nThe hickories have long tap roots, and they do best in soils which the\r\ntap roots can penetrate, going down like a radish. The root system makes\r\nmost hickories difficult trees to transplant. Early in life they do a\r\nlarge part of their growing under ground, and when that growth is\r\ninterrupted, as it must be in transplanting, the young tree seldom\r\nrecovers. Those who would grow hickories for timber, nuts, or as\r\nornaments, should plant the seed where the tree is expected to remain.\r\nMost of the planting of hickory in the forest is done by squirrels which\r\nbury nuts, with the apparent expectation of digging them up later.\r\nOccasionally one is missed, and a young tree starts.\r\n\r\nThe uses of this wood are typical of all the other hickories. Handles\r\nand light vehicles consume most of it. The markets are in all parts of\r\nthis country, and in manufacturing centers in many foreign lands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBITTERNUT HICKORY\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BITTERNUT HICKORY]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBITTERNUT HICKORY\r\n\r\n(_Hicoria Minima_)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe tannin in the thin shelled nuts which grow abundantly on this tree\r\ngives the name bitternut. The name is truly descriptive. Gall itself\r\nscarcely exceeds the intense bitterness of the kernel, when crushed\r\nbetween the teeth. The sense of taste does not immediately detect the\r\nbitterness in its full intensity. A little time seems to be necessary to\r\ndissolve the astringent principal and distribute it to the nerves of\r\ntaste. When this has been accomplished, the bitterness remains a long\r\ntime, seeming to persist after the last vestige of the cause has been\r\nremoved. In that respect it may be likened to the resin of the incense\r\ncedar of California which is among tastes what musk is among odors,\r\nnearly everlasting. The bitterness of this hickory nut has much to do\r\nwith the perpetuation of the species. No wild or tame animal will eat\r\nthe fruit unless forced by famine. Consequently, the nuts are left to\r\ngrow, provided they can get themselves planted. That is not always easy,\r\nfor small quadrupeds which bury edible nuts for food, and then\r\noccasionally forget them, show no interest whatever in the unpalatable\r\nbitternut. It is left where it falls, unless running water, or some\r\nother method of locomotion, transports it to another locality. This\r\nhappens with sufficient frequency to plant the nuts as widely as those\r\nof any other hickory. It is believed that this is the most abundant of\r\nthe hickories.\r\n\r\nThe tree bears names other than bitternut. It is called swamp hickory,\r\nthough that name is more applicable to a different species, the water\r\nhickory. Pig hickory or pignut are names used in several states, but\r\nwithout good reason. Hogs may sometimes eat the nuts, but never when\r\nanything better can be found. Besides, pignut is the accepted name of\r\nanother species (_Hicoria glabra_). In Louisiana they call it the bitter\r\npecan tree. Bitter hickory is a common name in many localities. In New\r\nHampshire it is known as pig walnut, in Vermont as bitter walnut, and in\r\nTexas as white hickory. The names are so many, and so often apply as\r\nwell to other hickories as to this, that the name alone is seldom a safe\r\nguide to identification. It has two or three characters which will help\r\nto pick it out from among others. Its leaves and bark bear considerable\r\nresemblance to ash. The leaves are the smallest among the hickories, and\r\nthe bark is never shaggy. The small branches always carry yellow buds,\r\nno matter what the season of the year. The compound leaves are from six\r\nto ten inches long, and consist of from five to nine leaflets, always an\r\nodd number.\r\n\r\nBitternut hickory’s range covers pretty generally the eastern part of\r\nthe United States. It is one of the largest and commonest hickories of\r\nNew England, and is likewise the common hickory of Kansas, Nebraska, and\r\nIowa. It grows from Maine through southern Canada to Minnesota, follows\r\ndown the western side of the Mississippi valley to Texas, and extends\r\ninto western Florida.\r\n\r\nHickory is often lumbered in ways not common with other hardwoods. It is\r\nnot generally found in ordinary lumber yards, and is not cut into lumber\r\nas most other woods are. It is in a class by itself. The person who\r\nwould consult statistics of lumber cut in the United States to ascertain\r\nthe quantity of hickory going to market, would utterly fail to obtain\r\nthe desired information. The statistics of lumber cut in the United\r\nStates for the year 1910 listed the total for hickory at 272,252,000\r\nfeet, distributed among 33 states, and cut by 6,349 mills. Reports by\r\nusers of this wood in a number of states show that probably twice as\r\nmuch goes to factories to be manufactured into finished commodities, as\r\nall the sawmills cut. This means that much hickory goes to factories\r\nwithout having passed through sawmills to be first converted into\r\nlumber. It goes as bolts and billets, and as logs of various lengths.\r\nSome sawmills in the hickory region cut dimension stock and sell it to\r\nfactories to be further worked up; but that is a comparatively small\r\npart of the hickory that finds its way to factories of various kinds.\r\nMany sawmills refuse to cut hickory, claiming that it does not pay them\r\nto specialize on a scarce wood. Scattered trees occur among other\r\ntimber, but these are left when the other logging is done. Special\r\noperators go after the hickory, and distribute it among various\r\nindustries which are in the market for it. That method often results in\r\nmuch waste, because the man who is specializing in one commodity, such\r\nas wagon poles, ax handles, sucker-rods, wheel stock, or the like, is\r\napt to cut out only what meets his requirements, and abandon the rest.\r\nSome of the hickory camps where such stock is roughed out are spectacles\r\nof carelessness and waste, with heaps of rejected hickory which, though\r\nnot meeting requirements for the special articles in view, are valuable\r\nfor many other things. Few woods contribute to the trash heap more in\r\nproportion to the total cut than hickory; but the waste nearly all\r\noccurs before the factories which finally work up the products are\r\nreached. These factories are often hundreds of miles from the forests\r\nwhere the hickory grows.\r\n\r\nHickory was not a useful farm timber in early times, as oak and chestnut\r\nwere. It decayed quickly when exposed to weather, and was not suitable\r\nfor fence rails, posts, house logs, or general lumber. It was sometimes\r\nused for barn floors, but when seasoned it was so hard to nail that it\r\nwas not well liked. The pioneers were not able to use this wood to\r\nadvantage, because it is a manufacturer’s material, not a farmer’s or a\r\nvillager’s standby. It can be said to the credit of the pioneers,\r\nhowever, that they knew its value for certain purposes, and employed as\r\nmuch of it as they needed.\r\n\r\nFuel was the most important place for hickory on the farm. All things\r\nconsidered, it is probably the best firewood of the American forest. The\r\nyawning fireplaces called for cords of wood every month of winter in the\r\nnorthern states. Enough to make a modern buggy would go up the chimney\r\nin a rich red blaze in an hour, and no one thought that it was waste;\r\nand it was not waste then, because farms had to be cleared, and firewood\r\nwas the best use possible for the hickory at that time. Every cord\r\nburned in the chimney was that much less to be rolled into logheaps and\r\nconsumed in the clearing for the new cornfield.\r\n\r\nHickory has always been considered the best material for smoking meat.\r\nMore than 30,000 cords a year are now used that way. It was so used in\r\nearly times, when every farmer smoked and packed his own meat. Hickory\r\nsmoke was supposed to give bacon a flavor equalled by no other wood; and\r\nin addition to that it was believed to keep the skippers out.\r\n\r\nThe nuts were made into oil which was thought to be efficacious as a\r\nliniment employed as a remedy against rheumatism to which pioneers were\r\nsusceptible because their moccasins were porous and their feet were\r\noften wet. The oil was used also for illuminating purposes. It fed the\r\nflame of a crude lamp.\r\n\r\nNo other wood equalled hickory for “split brooms,” the kind that swept\r\nthe cabins before broom corn was known or carpet sweepers and vacuum\r\ncleaners were invented. The toughness, smoothness, and strength of\r\nhickory made it the best oxbow wood, and the same property fitted it for\r\nbarrel hoops. Thousands of fish casks in New England and tobacco\r\nhogsheads in Maryland and Virginia were hooped with hickory before\r\nGeorge Washington was born. The wood’s value for ax handles was learned\r\nearly. The Indians used it for the long, slender handles of their stone\r\nhammers with which they barked trees in their clearings, and broke the\r\nskulls of enemies in war.\r\n\r\nBitternut hickory has about ninety-two per cent of the strength of\r\nshagbark, and seventy-three per cent of its stiffness. It yields\r\nconsiderably more ash when burned, and is rated a little lower in fuel\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\n    MOCKER NUT HICKORY (_Hicoria alba_) has many names. It is called\r\n    mocker nut in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New York, New Jersey,\r\n    Delaware, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, Arkansas,\r\n    Illinois, Iowa, and Kansas; white heart hickory, Rhode Island, New\r\n    York, Pennsylvania, Delaware, North Carolina, Texas, Illinois,\r\n    Ontario, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, and Nebraska; black hickory,\r\n    Texas, Mississippi, Louisiana, Missouri; big bud and red hickory,\r\n    Florida; hardback hickory, Illinois; white hickory, Pennsylvania,\r\n    South Carolina; big hickory nut, West Virginia; hognut, Delaware.\r\n    The name mocker nut is supposed to refer to the thick shell and\r\n    disappointingly small kernel within. The range is not as extensive\r\n    as some of the other hickories. Beginning in southern Ontario, it\r\n    extends westward and southward to eastern Kansas and the eastern\r\n    half of Texas. The region of its most abundant growth is in the\r\n    basin of the lower Ohio and in Arkansas, the best specimens\r\n    appearing in fertile uplands. This is said to be the only hickory\r\n    that invades the southern maritime pinebelt, growing on the low\r\n    country along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts in abundance. The leaves\r\n    are fragrant with a powerful, resinous odor; they have five or seven\r\n    leaflets with hairy petioles or stems. The bark resembles that of\r\n    bitternut, and is not scaly like that of shagbark. The wood weighs\r\n    51.21 pounds per cubic foot. It is hard, strong, tough, flexible. It\r\n    has about ninety-four per cent of the strength of shagbark, and\r\n    eighty per cent of its stiffness. Certain selected specimens of this\r\n    species are probably as strong as any hickory; but, as is the case\r\n    with all woods, there is great difference between specimens, and\r\n    general averages only are to be relied upon. G. W. Letterman, who\r\n    collected woods for Sargent’s tests, procured a sample of this\r\n    hickory near Allenton, Missouri, which showed strength sufficient to\r\n    sustain 20,000 pounds per square inch, and its measure of stiffness\r\n    was the enormous figure of 2,208,000 pounds per square inch.\r\n\r\n    The uses of mocker nut hickory do not differ from those of other\r\n    hickories. The tree is frequently nearly all sapwood, to which the\r\n    name white hickory is due. Some persons suppose that the heartwood\r\n    is white, but that misconception is due to the fact that some pretty\r\n    large trees have no heartwood, but are sap clear through.\r\n\r\n    The term “black hickory” is sometimes applied to three species with\r\n    dark-colored bark which bears some resemblance to the bark of ash.\r\n    They are bitternut (_Hicoria minima_), pignut (_Hicoria glabra_),\r\n    and mocker nut (_Hicoria alba_). When the word black is thus used,\r\n    it refers to the bark and the general outward appearance of the\r\n    tree, and not to the wood, which is as white as that of any other\r\n    hickory.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPIGNUT HICKORY\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PIGNUT HICKORY]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPIGNUT HICKORY\r\n\r\n(_Hicoria Glabra_)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe name of this tree is unfortunate, although so far as the nuts are\r\nconcerned, no injustice is done. It is one of the best hickories in the\r\nquality of its wood, and also as an ornamental tree. It is likewise\r\nabundant in many parts of its range, which extends from Maine to Kansas,\r\nTexas, Florida, and throughout most of the territory enclosed by the\r\nboundary lines thus delimited.\r\n\r\nThe name pignut is common in New England, New York, New Jersey,\r\nPennsylvania, Delaware, West Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina,\r\nFlorida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, Arkansas, Kentucky,\r\nMissouri, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, and\r\nMinnesota; bitternut in Arkansas, Illinois, Iowa, and Wisconsin; black\r\nhickory in Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, Missouri, Iowa, and\r\nIndiana; broom hickory in Missouri; brown hickory in Mississippi,\r\nDelaware, Texas, Tennessee, Minnesota; hardshell in West Virginia; red\r\nhickory in Delaware; switch bud hickory in Alabama; and white hickory in\r\nNew Hampshire and Iowa.\r\n\r\nThe nuts are generally bitter, but some trees bear fruit which is not\r\nvery offensive to the taste. The avidity with which swine feed upon it\r\ngives the common name. This tree is doubtless confused many times with\r\nbitternut, though their differences are enough to distinguish them\r\nreadily if they grow side by side. As far as the woods of the two\r\nspecies are concerned, there is little occasion to keep them separate.\r\nThe pignut is a forked tree more frequently than any other species of\r\nhickory; and the nuts vary in shape and size more than those of any\r\nother. The tree is more remarkable for its variations than for its\r\nregularity. In one thing, however, it is pretty constant: the limbs and\r\nbranches are smooth and clean, hence the botanical name _glabra_. As a\r\nname for this tree, smooth hickory would be preferable to pignut. Trunks\r\nattain a height of eighty or ninety feet and a diameter of three or\r\nfour, but the extreme sizes are rare. The largest specimens are found in\r\nthe lower Ohio valley, and the species is most common in Missouri and\r\nArkansas. It grows farther south and farther west than any other hickory\r\nexcept pecan. Its southern limit is in Florida and its western in Texas.\r\n\r\nThe uses of hickory fall into general classes. More is manufactured into\r\nvehicles than into any other single class of commodities, but not more\r\nthan into all other articles combined. The second largest users of\r\nhickory are the manufacturers of handles. The third largest demand comes\r\nfrom makers of agricultural implements and farm tools. Large amounts\r\nare required for athletic goods, meat smoking, and various miscellaneous\r\npurposes. The total amount used yearly in this country, and exported to\r\nforeign countries, is not accurately known, but it probably exceeds\r\n500,000,000 feet, board measure. About half of this passes through\r\nsawmills in the usual manner, and the other half goes directly from the\r\nforest to the factory or to the consumer.\r\n\r\nThe superiority of American buggies, sulkies, and other light vehicles\r\nis due to the hickory in their construction. No other wood equals this\r\nin combination of desirable physical properties. Though heavy, it is so\r\nstrong, tough, and resilient that small amounts suffice, and the weight\r\nof the vehicle can be reduced to a lower point, without sacrificing\r\nefficiency, than when any other wood is employed. It is preëminently a\r\nwood for light vehicles. Oak, ash, maple, and elm answer well enough for\r\nheavy wagons where strength is more essential than toughness and\r\nelasticity. Hickory is suitable for practically all wooden parts of\r\nlight vehicles except the body. The slender spokes look like frail\r\ndowels, and seem unable to maintain the load, but appearances are\r\ndeceptive. The bent rims are likewise very slender, but they last better\r\nthan steel. The shafts and poles with which carriages and carts are\r\nequipped will stand severe strains and twists without starting a\r\nsplinter. The manufacturing of the stock is little less than a fine art.\r\nIn scarcely any other wood-using industry--probably excepting the making\r\nof handles--is the grain so closely watched. Hickory users generally\r\nspeak of the annual growth rings as the grain. The grain must run\r\nstraight in spokes, rims, shafts, and poles. If the grain crosses the\r\nstick, a break may occur by the simple process of splitting, and the\r\nhickory in that case is no more dependable than many other woods.\r\n\r\nHandle makers observe the same rule, and must have straight grain. The\r\nmore slender the handle, the more strictly the rule must be followed. A\r\ncross grained golf club handle would fail at the first stroke. An ax\r\nhandle, if it has cross grain, will last a little longer, but it will\r\nspeedily split. Many of the best slender handles are of split hickory.\r\nThe line of cleavage follows the grain, but a saw does not always do so.\r\nHeavy handles, like those for picks and sledges, are not so strictly\r\nstraight grained, because they are made strong enough to stand much more\r\nstrain than is ever likely to be put on them. Red heartwood is\r\nfrequently used in handles of that kind. Peavey and canthook handles are\r\ngenerally split from billets, because the grain must be straight. Though\r\nthey are among the largest and heaviest of handles, breakage must be\r\nguarded against with extra care, for the snap of a peavey handle at a\r\ncritical moment might cost the operator his life by precipitating a\r\nskidway of logs upon him.\r\n\r\nThe hickory which goes into agricultural implements fills many places,\r\namong the most important being connecting rods. It is often made into\r\nsprings to take up or check oscillation. It is used for that purpose as\r\npicker sticks in textile mills.\r\n\r\nFurniture makers could get along without hickory, and they do not need\r\nmuch. It is oftenest seen in dowels, slender spindles, and the rungs of\r\nchairs. The makers of sporting and athletic goods bend it for rackets,\r\nhoops, and rims, or make vaulting poles, bats, or trapezes.\r\n\r\nSHELLBARK HICKORY (_Hicoria laciniosa_) is often mistaken for shagbark.\r\nThe ranges of the two species coincide in part only. Shagbark grows\r\nfarther east, north and south than shellbark. The latter occupies an\r\nisland, as it were, inside the shagbark’s range. Shellbark is found from\r\ncentral New York and eastern Pennsylvania, westward to Kansas, and\r\nsouthward to North Carolina and middle Tennessee. The species is at its\r\nbest in the lower Ohio valley and in Missouri. The largest trees are 120\r\nfeet high and three in diameter, and are often free from branches half\r\nor two-thirds of the length. The species prefers rich, deep bottom\r\nlands, and does not suffer from occasional inundation from overflowing\r\nrivers. The average tree is not quite as large as shagbark. The leaves\r\nare larger than those of any other hickory, ranging in length from\r\nfifteen to twenty-two inches. There are from five to nine leaflets,\r\nusually seven. The upper ones are largest, and may be eight or nine\r\ninches long and four or five wide. In the autumn the leaflets drop from\r\nthe petioles which adhere to the branches and furnish means of\r\nidentifying the tree in winter. The nuts including the hulls are as\r\nlarge as small apples. When ripe, the hulls open and the nuts fall out;\r\nbut the hulls fall also. The nuts are as large as shagbark nuts, but the\r\ntwo are seldom distinguished in market, though the shagbark’s are a\r\nlittle richer in flavor. The bark’s roughness gives the tree its name.\r\nStrips three or four feet long and five or six inches wide curl up at\r\nthe lower ends--sometimes at both ends--and adhere to the trunk several\r\nyears. The species has other names. It is known as big shellbark in\r\nRhode Island, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Kentucky, Missouri, Illinois,\r\nand Kansas; bottom shellbark in Illinois; western shellbark or simply\r\nshellbark in Rhode Island and Kentucky; thick shellbark in South\r\nCarolina, Indiana, and Tennessee; kingnut in Tennessee.\r\n\r\nThe wood weighs 50.53 pounds per cubic foot, and is very hard, strong,\r\ntough, and flexible. The heartwood is dark brown, the sapwood nearly\r\nwhite. This hickory usually has less sapwood in proportion to heart than\r\nother members of the species; but the wood is not kept separate from the\r\nothers when it goes to market, and its uses are as extensive as the\r\nother hickories’. It is believed by some foresters that shellbark\r\nhickory is worth cultivating for its nuts, as it is a vigorous bearer;\r\nbut little planting has been done. East of the Alleghanies, particularly\r\nin Virginia, some planting has been carried out on old plantations for\r\nornamental purposes. On account of its long taproot, the tree is\r\ndifficult to transplant, and the nuts should be planted where the trees\r\nare expected to remain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPECAN\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PECAN]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPECAN\r\n\r\n(_Hicoria Pecan_)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe name is pecan in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Alabama,\r\nMississippi, Texas, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, and\r\nKansas; pecan nut and pecan tree in Louisiana. The name is of Indian\r\norigin, and means walnut. The tree’s natural range is smaller than the\r\npresent area in which the tree is found, for it has been extensively\r\nplanted in recent years. It is found as far north as Iowa, south to\r\nTexas, and east to Alabama and Kentucky. The highest development of the\r\nwild tree is in the lower Ohio valley. Forest trees were once found\r\nthere which were said to be six feet in diameter and 170 high. Specimens\r\nthat large would be hard to find now.\r\n\r\nThe pecan is a hickory. As to wood, it is the poorest of the hickories,\r\nand as to nuts it is the best. Its compound leaves are from twelve to\r\ntwenty inches long with from nine to seventeen leaflets. The latter are\r\nfrom four to eight inches in length, and from one to three wide. The\r\nfirst pairs on the petiole are smallest. The fruit grows in clusters of\r\nfrom three to eleven, the number exceeding any other hickory. The nuts\r\nare four-angled, and long for their width.\r\n\r\nThe wood of pecan has disappointed those who have attempted to use it\r\nlike other hickories. It does not differ much from them in appearance,\r\nbut it falls low in mechanical tests. In strength, toughness, and\r\nstiffness it is inferior to the poorest of the other hickories. It has\r\nless than half the strength and half the stiffness of shagbark hickory.\r\nIt is a fairly good fuel, but is high in ash.\r\n\r\nThe inferior quality of the wood has saved many a pecan tree from the\r\nsawmill and the wagon shop. Fine trunks stand near public highways,\r\nalong river banks, and in fields, while all merchantable hickories of\r\nother species have been sent to market. The uses of the wood are few. If\r\nsome of it goes to wagon shops or to factories where agricultural\r\nvehicles are made, it is employed for parts which are not required to\r\nendure strain or sustain sudden jars.\r\n\r\nFortunately it is a tree with a value of another kind. It is the most\r\nimportant nut tree of the United States at this time, and it promises to\r\nremain so. The forest-grown pecans were an article of food for Indians\r\nwho once lived in the region, and though white settlers who succeeded\r\nthe Indians as occupants of the land, depended less upon forest fruits\r\nthan the red men had done, yet the pecan was often of supreme importance\r\nin the early years of settlement. The nuts have constituted an article\r\nof commerce ever since the region had markets.\r\n\r\nNurserymen were not slow to recognize the value of the pecan tree for\r\nplanting purposes, and nursery grown stock has been on the market many\r\nyears. Extensive orchards have been planted in Texas, Louisiana,\r\nFlorida, and other southern states, and some of the earliest of these\r\norchards are now in bearing. However, by far the largest part of pecans\r\non the market is wild fruit from the forests. Many are shipped in from\r\nMexico, but most grow in the rich woods of southern states. They are\r\ngathered like chestnuts in northern woods. The people who pick them sell\r\nto local stores at low prices, often taking pay in merchandise. Buyers\r\ncollect the stock from country and village merchants, and put it on the\r\ngeneral market, often at three or four times the price paid to the\r\ngatherers of the nuts.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important matters connected with pecan is the large\r\nnumber of horticultural varieties which have been produced by\r\ncultivation and selection. More than seventy have been listed in nursery\r\ncatalogues and special reports. Some of the nuts are twice the size of\r\nthose of the forest, and shells have been reduced in thinness until some\r\nof them are really thinner than they should be to stand the rough usage\r\nwhich comes to them in reaching markets.\r\n\r\nDealers occasionally polish pecans to impart the rich, brown color which\r\nis supposed to give them the appearance of being fresh and of high\r\ngrade. The polishing is produced by friction, when the nuts in bulk are\r\nshaken violently. Last year’s stock takes on as bright a polish as fresh\r\nstock, and the color and smoothness alone are not sufficient to prove\r\nthat pecans are fresh from the trees.\r\n\r\nThe planted pecan tree grows rapidly and is as easily raised as fruit\r\ntrees. The wild tree is long-lived, and the cultivated varieties will\r\nprobably be like it.\r\n\r\n    NUTMEG HICKORY (_Hicoria myristicæformis_) is so named because the\r\n    nut has the size and the wrinkled surface of a nutmeg, though the\r\n    shape is different. The husk enclosing the nut is almost as thin as\r\n    paper. The only other name by which it is known is bitter waternut,\r\n    in Louisiana. The name scarcely applies, for the kernel is said not\r\n    to be bitter. The range of nutmeg hickory extends from the coast of\r\n    South Carolina to Arkansas. It is rather abundant in Arkansas, but\r\n    scarce in most other parts of its range. The tree has several\r\n    interesting features. It was partly discovered a long time before\r\n    the discovery was complete. In 1802 Andre F. Michaux saw the nut and\r\n    to that extent the species was discovered, but many years passed\r\n    before a full description was given to the world by a competent\r\n    botanist. The wood rates among the strongest and stiffest of all the\r\n    hickories, according to present information; but the calculations\r\n    were based on too few tests to be considered final. Two samples of\r\n    wood procured near Bonneau’s depot, South Carolina, by W. H.\r\n    Revenel, showed the remarkable breaking strength of 19,822 pounds\r\n    per square inch, and the measure of stiffness exceeded 2,000,000\r\n    pounds to the square inch. That strength is sixteen per cent above\r\n    shagbark. The weight of nutmeg hickory is 46.96 pounds to the cubic\r\n    foot. The wood is hard, tough, and compact. The structure, including\r\n    pores, medullary rays, annual rings, springwood and summerwood, is\r\n    similar to the wood of other hickories. Trees grow best in sandy\r\n    soil but near swamps and rivers where there is plenty of water. The\r\n    largest trunks are eighty or one hundred feet in height and two in\r\n    diameter. When use is made of this hickory it serves the same\r\n    purposes as the wood of other trees of the group. It is never\r\n    reported separately in statistics of wood utilization. It is too\r\n    scarce to be important as a timber tree. It apparently has a future\r\n    as an ornament, though it has not yet been widely planted. It has\r\n    proved a success in the Carolinas and it thrives in the climate of\r\n    Washington, D. C. The luster of its foliage makes it the most\r\n    beautiful of the hickories. In common with other members of the\r\n    genus, its long taproot renders the transplanting of nursery stock\r\n    difficult.\r\n\r\n    WATER HICKORY (_Hicoria aquatica_) is known as swamp hickory in\r\n    South Carolina, Florida, Mississippi, and Louisiana; bitter pecan in\r\n    Mississippi and Louisiana, and water bitternut in Tennessee and\r\n    South Carolina. The northern limit of this species is in Virginia\r\n    near Mobjack bay, the southern limit in the Caloosa valley, Florida,\r\n    west to the Brazos river, Texas, and north to southern Illinois. The\r\n    wood is hard, heavy, strong, but rather brittle; the sapwood is\r\n    thick and often is nearly white, while the heartwood is dark brown.\r\n    It is the most porous of the hickories, and the pores are\r\n    distributed generally through the annual rings of growth. In other\r\n    hickories they are largely restricted to the inner part of each\r\n    ring, though a few are dispersed through all parts. In swamp hickory\r\n    there is little difference in appearance between the wood grown\r\n    early in the season and that produced later. The tree is a rapid\r\n    grower. It is an inhabitant of deep swamps, and if the land is\r\n    inundated a considerable part of the year, the tree seems to grow\r\n    all the better. At its best it may attain a height of 100 feet, and\r\n    a diameter of two, but that size is unusual. The nut is small and\r\n    wrinkled, and when broken open, pockets of red bitter powder are\r\n    frequently found inside the shell. Usually the nuts are too bitter\r\n    to be eaten, but it is said that near the western limit of the\r\n    tree’s range, nuts are sometimes edible.\r\n\r\n    The only reported uses for the wood are fuel and fencing. It is poor\r\n    fence material, because, like other hickories, it decays in a short\r\n    time when exposed to weather. The wood of this genus is rich in\r\n    foods on which decay-producing fungi feed. Fungus is a low order of\r\n    plant life which sends its hair-like threads into the wood cells and\r\n    consumes the material found there; but numerous insects bore into\r\n    wood to procure food. Few woods suffer from such attacks more than\r\n    hickory. Even after it is seasoned and manufactured into\r\n    commodities, it is frequently attacked by various species of powder\r\n    post beetles, and much injury results. Water hickory while yet\r\n    standing is often greatly damaged by the larvæ of certain moths\r\n    which find their way into the soft wood just under the bark and\r\n    tunnel minute galleries which subsequently fill with brown\r\n    substance. According to R. B. Hough, these brown streaks in water\r\n    hickory are hard enough to turn the edge of steel tools. They not\r\n    only damage the structure of the wood but spoil its appearance.\r\n\r\n    BITTER PECAN (_Hicoria texana_) is a Texas species which has not\r\n    been reported elsewhere. The average size of the tree is from\r\n    fifteen to twenty-five feet in height and eight to ten inches in\r\n    diameter; but in rich bottom land, particularly along the Brazos\r\n    river, specimens sometimes attain a diameter of three feet and a\r\n    height of 100. The leaves are from ten to twelve inches in length,\r\n    with from seven to eleven leaflets. The nuts are very bitter, but\r\n    are of approximately the same size and shape as edible pecans. The\r\n    shells are thin and very brittle. The tree’s range extends inland\r\n    100 or 150 miles from the Texas coast.\r\n\r\n    NORTH CAROLINA SHAGBARK HICKORY (_Hicoria carolinæ-septentrionalis_)\r\n    is found in the neighboring parts of the four states: North\r\n    Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, and Alabama. In the best land this\r\n    tree is occasionally eighty feet high and two or three in diameter,\r\n    but when it occurs on dry hillsides its average height is twenty or\r\n    thirty feet, and its diameter about a foot. The compound leaves are\r\n    from four to eight inches long, with usually three, but occasionally\r\n    five leaflets. The sweet nuts are small and brown. The bark\r\n    separates into thick strips a foot or more in length and three or\r\n    four inches wide. The rough trunk resembles the northern shagbark\r\n    hickory. The wood is very tough, strong, and hard, the heart light\r\n    reddish-brown, the thin sapwood nearly white. It is not\r\n    distinguished from the other hickories in commerce, and it has the\r\n    same uses when any use is made of it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHITE ELM\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHITE ELM]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHITE ELM\r\n\r\n(_Ulmus Americana_)\r\n\r\n\r\nSix species of elm occur in the United States, not counting the planer\r\ntree as an elm, though lumbermen usually consider it as such.[5] The\r\nwhite elm is the most common, is distributed most widely, and is\r\ncommercially the most important. More of it is used as lumber, slack\r\ncooperage, and other forms of forest products, than all other elms of\r\nthis country combined. The statistics of sawmill output collected\r\nannually by the United States census are not compiled in a way to show\r\nthe elms separately. All go in as one. The annual lumber cut of elm in\r\nthe whole country is about 265,000,000 feet, distributed over\r\nthirty-four states, with Wisconsin leading, followed in the order named\r\nby Michigan, Indiana, Ohio, Missouri, Arkansas, New York, and Minnesota.\r\nIn addition to lumber, elm furnishes about 130,000,000 slack cooperage\r\nstaves yearly.\r\n\r\n    [5] The elms are white elm (_Ulmus americana_), cork elm (_Ulmus\r\n    racemosa_), slippery elm (_Ulmus pubescens_), cedar elm (_Ulmus\r\n    crassifolia_), wing elm (_Ulmus alata_), and red elm (_Ulmus\r\n    serotina_). They are all confined to the region east of the Rocky\r\n    Mountains.\r\n\r\nThe elms, taken as a class, are much alike. There is more resemblance\r\nbetween the species than between species of oaks or pines, yet some\r\ndifference exists between elms. This holds not only between different\r\nspecies, but between individuals of the same species. Climate,\r\nsituation, and soil have much to do with the character of the wood of\r\nthe same species. So great is the difference at times that fairly good\r\njudges of timber are deceived as to the species. A tree growing on dry,\r\nrocky soil produces wood quite different from one on rich, deep,\r\nwell-watered soil. Not only is the wood of one different from that of\r\nthe other, but the appearances of the standing trees are not alike. The\r\ndifferences may not show in leaves, flowers, and fruit as much as in the\r\nshapes and sizes of trees, and the habit of the branches.\r\n\r\nWhite elm is by common consent the type of the genus, the standard by\r\nwhich the other species are measured. It is proper to compare certain\r\nproperties and characters of other elms with white elm, in order that a\r\ngeneral view of all may be had. The dry weights, per cubic foot, of wood\r\nare as follows: White elm 40.54 pounds, slippery elm 43.35, cedar elm\r\n45.15, cork elm 45.26, and wing elm 46.69. Figures which show the weight\r\nof the southern red elm (_Ulmus serotina_) are not available. White elm\r\nis thus shown to be lightest of the group.\r\n\r\nIts breaking strength averages 12,158 pounds per cubic inch, under the\r\nusual tests by which the strength of woods is determined. Reduced to\r\neveryday language that means that 12,158 pounds would just break a white\r\nelm stick, 2⅝ inches square, and resting on supports twelve inches\r\napart. That is the meaning of “breaking strength,” or “modulus of\r\nrupture,” as the term is used in engineering text books relating to\r\nwoods. The following figures for the breaking strength of other elms\r\nmake comparisons with white elm easy: Cedar elm 11,000; wing elm 11,162;\r\nslippery elm 12,342; cork elm (often called rock elm) 15,172. It is\r\nshown that two elms are stronger and two weaker than white elm. This\r\nwood rates very little below white oak in strength.\r\n\r\nThe different species of elms vary considerably in stiffness, or the\r\nability to spring back when bent. This factor is expressed by engineers\r\nin high figures, is purely technical, and is based on a wood’s ability\r\nto stretch and regain its former position. The only service which the\r\nfigures can render to the layman is to furnish a basis for comparing one\r\nwood with another. The stiffer a wood, the greater its resistance to an\r\neffort to stretch it lengthwise. White elm’s measure of stiffness\r\n(modulus of elasticity) is 1,070,000 pounds per square inch; wing elm\r\n853,000; cedar elm 981,000; slippery elm 1,318,000; cork elm 1,512,000.\r\nIt is shown here, as was shown in the figures representing the strength\r\nof the elms, that two species rate above and two below white elm in\r\nstiffness.\r\n\r\nWhite elm is known by several names. The color of the bark is\r\nresponsible for the name gray elm among lumbermen and woodworkers of the\r\nLake States. American elm is a translation of its botanical name, and is\r\nneither descriptive nor definitive, because there are other elms as\r\ntruly American as this one. White elm distinguishes its wood from the\r\nredder wood of slippery elm, but it would often be difficult if not\r\nimpossible to identify the elms, or any one of them, by the color of the\r\nwood alone. Some persons who call this elm white doubtless refer to the\r\ncolor of the bark, as is the case with those who speak of it as gray\r\nelm. It is known as water elm in several states, but that name is\r\napplied indiscriminately to any elm that frequents river banks, as most\r\nof them do in some part of their range. It is called rock elm when it is\r\nfound on stony uplands, and swamp elm on low wet ground. In some parts\r\nof the Appalachian mountain ranges it is called astringent elm to\r\ndistinguish it from slippery elm.\r\n\r\nWhite elm surpasses the others in extent of range. Its northern boundary\r\nstretches from Newfoundland, across Canada to the eastern base of the\r\nRocky Mountains, a distance of nearly 3,000 miles. It runs south through\r\nthe Atlantic states to Florida, a distance of 1,200 miles or more. Its\r\nsouthwestern limit is in Texas. The area thus bounded is about\r\n2,500,000 square miles. A few other trees have ranges as large, but none\r\nmuch exceed it. It covers so much of America, and is so important in\r\nmany parts of its range, that it is clearly the leading elm in this\r\ncountry. It is entitled to first place among elms for other reasons.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to give any sure features or characteristics by which the\r\nlayman may always distinguish this elm from others with which it is\r\nassociated; however, by carefully observing certain features, the\r\nidentity of white elm is generally easy to establish.\r\n\r\nThe leaves have teeth along the margins like beech and birch. They have\r\nstraight primary veins running from the midrib to the points of the\r\nteeth. Before falling in autumn the leaves turn yellow. The foliage is\r\nnot very thick, and most of it is near the ends of the limbs. The bloom\r\ncomes early in the spring, ahead of the leaves, and the seeds are ripe\r\nand ready for flight before the leaves are grown. Sometimes the seeds\r\nare ripe almost before the leaves are out of the buds. The seeds are\r\noblong, and about the size of a small lentil. The wing entirely\r\nsurrounds the seed, and is about half an inch long. The flight of elm\r\nseeds is an interesting phenomenon. The individual seeds are so small\r\nthat they are not easily seen as they sail away from the tall tree top\r\nbut when they go in swarms, in fitful puffs of wind, they are not hard\r\nto see. It is chiefly by their fruits that they are known, that is, by\r\nthe multitudes of seedlings that appear a few weeks later. If one\r\nseedling elm in a thousand should reach maturity, there would be little\r\nbesides elms in the whole country. They spring up by highways and\r\nhedges, in gutters, fields, and even between cobbles and bricks of paved\r\nstreets; but in a few days they have crowded one another to death, or\r\nhave perished from other causes, and those which manage to live to\r\nmaturity do not much more than make up for old trees which perish from\r\nnatural causes.\r\n\r\nThe botanist Michaux pronounced the white elm “the most magnificent\r\nvegetable of the temperate zone.” A number of trees are larger, though\r\nthis reaches great size. Sargent sets the limit of the tree at 120 feet\r\nhigh and eleven feet in trunk diameter. That size is, of course,\r\nunusual, but it has been surpassed at least in height. A tree in\r\nJefferson county, Pennsylvania, was 140 feet high, and although forest\r\ngrown, it had a spread of crown of seventy-six feet. It was sent to the\r\nsawmill where it made 8,820 feet of lumber. That trunk was only five\r\nfeet in diameter.\r\n\r\nSome of the finest forest grown elms in this country have been cut in\r\nMichigan. Their trunks were as tall, straight, and shapely as yellow\r\npoplars, and their crowns surpassed those of poplars. It was formerly\r\nnot unusual for sawlogs to be cut from elm limbs which branched from the\r\ntrunk fifty or more feet from the ground. The best of the forest grown\r\nelm of this country has been cut; but it is still lumbered throughout\r\nthe whole eastern half of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe finest elms of this country, and doubtless the finest in the world,\r\nare the planted trees in some of the New England villages. The largest\r\nof them have been growing for two hundred years, and in many instances\r\nthey still show the vigor of youth. Trunks six or seven feet through are\r\nnot uncommon, but the glory of the trees is not alone in the trunks.\r\nTheir spread and form of crown are magnificent. The largest are 150 feet\r\nacross, and some of the splendid branches, rising in parabolic curves,\r\nare fully 100 feet long, from the junction with the tree to the tips of\r\nthe twigs. The most apt comparison for that form of elm is the spray of\r\na fountain. The upward jet of water corresponds to the trunk of the\r\ntree; the upward, outward, and downward curves of the spray represent\r\nthe crown of the elm. Trees which take that form are grown in open\r\nground where sunlight and air reach every side. Forest grown trees are\r\nless symmetrical, but even in dense woods, the elm frequently rises\r\nclear above the canopy of other trees, and develops the fountain form of\r\ncrown. The new England street and park elms surpass those farther west\r\nonly because they are older. The splendid trunks and crowns are the work\r\nof centuries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCORK ELM\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CORK ELM]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCORK ELM\r\n\r\n(_Ulmus Racemosa_)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis tree is called cork elm in Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island,\r\nNew York, New Jersey, Arkansas, Kentucky, Missouri, Wisconsin, Michigan,\r\nIowa, and Ohio; rock elm in Rhode Island, Kentucky, West Virginia,\r\nMissouri, Illinois, Wisconsin, Iowa, Michigan, Nebraska; hickory elm in\r\nMissouri, Iowa, Illinois, and Indiana; white elm in Ontario; Thomas elm\r\nin Tennessee; northern cork-barked elm in Tennessee; corkbark elm, New\r\nYork; northern cork elm, Vermont; wahoo, Ohio; cliff elm in Wisconsin.\r\n\r\nCork elm is the natural name. It is a descriptive term which a stranger\r\nwould be apt to apply on seeing the tree for the first time. The bark of\r\nthe branches, after it has attained an age of three or four years,\r\nbecomes rough by the growth of ridges and protuberances. This feature is\r\nsometimes so prominent that it at once attracts attention, particularly\r\nwhen the branches are bare of leaves; hence the name cork elm.\r\n\r\nLumbermen insist on naming the tree rock elm. They refer to the hardness\r\nof the wood, or they may have in mind the dry, stony situations where\r\ntough, strong elm grows. The latter is often the case, because the name\r\nis applied also to slippery elm and white elm if they grow on stony\r\nground. A wide-spread opinion prevails that wood which grows among rocks\r\nis harder, tougher, stronger, and more durable than that produced by\r\ndeep, fertile soil. It is possible to cite much evidence to support that\r\nview, and the case might be considered proved, but for the fact that an\r\nequal, or greater amount of evidence, in every way as trustworthy, may\r\nbe cited on the other side. The strongest hickory, ash, and oak do not\r\ncome from stony land. It sometimes happens that a species with tough,\r\nstrong wood, is found on rocks, but it is not tough because it is there,\r\nbut in spite of being there.\r\n\r\nThe name cliff elm which this tree bears in Wisconsin is but another\r\nform of the name rock elm, and clearly has reference to the situation\r\nwhere the tree grows in that part of the country. Hickory elm, on the\r\nother hand, a name applied to this tree much farther south, is a\r\nrecognition of the wood’s toughness.\r\n\r\nIn some particulars it does not fall much below hickory in toughness,\r\nbut is not as strong, elastic, or capable of as smooth polish. The\r\nlatter property is one of the recommendations of hickory when used for\r\nhandles. It is very smooth to the touch; cork elm is less so. In the\r\nnorthern woods, elm ax handles are in use, and some axmen prefer them\r\nto hickory. Such is probably the case when the best cork elm and a\r\nmedium or poor quality of hickory are in competition.\r\n\r\nThe fibers of cork elm are interlaced, rendering the splitting of the\r\nwood difficult. For uses in which that is a desirable property, it is\r\npreferable to hickory. It is better for hubs for large wagons, and that\r\nis a very important use for this elm.\r\n\r\nThe wood of all the elms is ring-porous; that is, the springwood, or\r\ninner part of the annual ring, consists of one or more rows of large\r\nducts. The summerwood contains pores in large numbers, but they are\r\nsmall, and are usually arranged in short curved lines. The medullary\r\nrays are not prominent in the wood of any of the elms, and\r\nquarter-sawing adds no beauty to the lumber. The wood is practically\r\nwithout figure, on account of either annual rings or medullary rays; but\r\nit may be stained, polished, and made very attractive. That is done\r\noftener with white elm than with any other.\r\n\r\nThe strength of cork elm created demand for it in boat building at an\r\nearly day. The tree is and always was scarce in the vicinity of the\r\nAtlantic sea board, and the earliest boat builders seem not to have been\r\nacquainted with the wood. It was most abundant in the forests of\r\nMichigan, though it extended westward to Nebraska. It was plentiful in\r\nthe province of Ontario, and the timbers from that region acquainted\r\nEnglish shipbuilders with the merits of the wood. They sent contractors\r\ninto Michigan to buy cork elm, long before the other hardwoods of that\r\nregion had attracted the attention of the outside world. The most\r\nconvenient supplies of cork elm on the Lower Michigan peninsula thus\r\npassed through Canada to ship yards on the other side of the sea. The\r\nwood is reputed to be more durable than any of the other elms.\r\n\r\nIt is generally understood that the country’s supply of cork elm is\r\nrunning short, but there are no statistics which show how much is left\r\nor how much has been cut. It is doubtful if the original forests,\r\nincluding the whole country, had one tree of cork elm to twenty of white\r\nelm. The average size of cork elm is sixty feet high and two in\r\ndiameter. The trunks are well shaped, if forest grown. They develop\r\nsmall crowns in proportion to the size of trunks; and the crowns are\r\nless graceful than those of white elm--lacking the long, sweeping curves\r\nof the latter. The general contour of the tree has been compared to\r\nwhite oak.\r\n\r\nCork elm grows well when planted on the Pacific coast, in environments\r\nquite different from its native habitat. In the forest it increases in\r\nsize slowly; when planted it makes much better headway. It has a\r\ndisagreeable habit of sprouting which puts it out of favor as a park\r\ntree.\r\n\r\nThe wood of the different elms is largely used for manufacturing\r\npurposes. They are sometimes kept separate, but generally not. The\r\nparticular place where cork elm is preferred is in the manufacture of\r\nvehicles and boats, but it is by no means confined to those commodities.\r\n\r\nThe state of Michigan alone sends 50,000,000 feet of elm a year to its\r\nfactories to be converted into articles of general utility. Furniture\r\nmakers take over 2,000,000 feet of it, though elm is not classed as a\r\nfurniture wood. In certain places it is superior to almost every other\r\nwood. No matter how discolored it becomes by weathering and the\r\naccumulation of foreign substances, a vigorous application of soap,\r\nwater, and a scrubbing brush will whiten it. It is liked in certain\r\nparts of refrigerators which need constant scrubbing. Elm to the extent\r\nof 8,000,000 feet goes into refrigerators in Michigan alone.\r\n\r\nThe strength and toughness of elm make it suitable for frames of tables.\r\nWhen thus used, it is generally out of sight, but not infrequently it is\r\nmade into table legs as well as frames. Statistics show that more than a\r\nmillion feet are manufactured yearly into handles in Michigan alone. All\r\nthree of the northern elms--white, cork, and slippery--are listed in the\r\nhandle industry.\r\n\r\nMany millions of feet of elm are yearly converted into automobile\r\nstock--3,000,000 in Michigan. Horse-drawn vehicles take more. The most\r\ncommon place for it is the hub, but it serves also as shafts, poles,\r\nreaches, and even as spokes for wagons of the largest size.\r\n\r\nThe important place in the slack cooperage industry held by elm is well\r\nknown. It is a flour barrel wood, but is employed for barrels of many\r\nother kinds. It stands high as veneer, not the kind of which the visible\r\nparts of furniture are made, but the invisible interior, built up of\r\nveneer sheets glued together. A similar kind of veneer forms the boxes\r\nor frames of trunks--the part to be covered by metal, leather, or cloth.\r\nThe slats which strengthen the outside of trunks are frequently of elm.\r\n\r\nThis wood is not in favor for one important purpose, hardwood\r\ndistillation. It has escaped pretty generally also from being employed\r\nas a farm material, on account of its poor lasting qualities. Some\r\nslippery elm was mauled into fence rails in the pioneer days of Ohio,\r\nIndiana, and southern Michigan, but that was only because it was\r\nplentiful and convenient. Cork elm probably never made a fence rail,\r\nbecause it is so unwedgeable that no rail splitter would have anything\r\nto do with it. At the best, it is but a temporary makeshift as fence\r\nposts, but by applying creosote and other preservative treatments to\r\nlessen decay, it measures up with most other post woods.\r\n\r\nThe elms are not indispensable woods in this country, but their\r\nexhaustion, should it ever come, will leave many places hard to fill. As\r\nfar as known, no woodlots of any species of elm have been planted in\r\nthis country, and there is little prospect that any will be planted,\r\nbecause the slow growth of the trees discourages foresters. A century\r\nor two is a long look ahead.\r\n\r\nHowever, the exhaustion of no species of the elms in this country need\r\nbe expected soon. The most apparent peril lies ahead of cork elm,\r\nbecause it never was abundant, and demand, which has been large for a\r\nlong time, is still strong. The species is scattered over more than\r\n200,000 square miles, and a long time must elapse before the last cork\r\nelm finds its way to the sawmill. The situation of white elm is more\r\npromising. It may be among the last trees of the American forests to\r\ntake its final departure. Its wide range and its bounteous seed crops\r\ninsure a supply, though not necessarily a large one, for a long time.\r\nThe greatest peril to elms, as well as to many other forest trees, is\r\nthat, when weakened by depletion, some disease will attack them and\r\ndestroy the remnants. Experience in New England and elsewhere has shown\r\nthat elm has no great resisting power when a strong attack is made upon\r\nit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSLIPPERY ELM\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SLIPPERY ELM]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSLIPPERY ELM\r\n\r\n(_Ulmus Pubescens_)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis tree is known as slippery elm in every state where it grows, thirty\r\nor more; but in some localities it has other names also. It is doubtful\r\nif any person who is acquainted with the tree would fail to recognize it\r\nby the name slippery elm, though some who are acquainted with the lumber\r\nonly might not know it by that name. Those who call it red elm have in\r\nmind the color of the heartwood which is of deeper red than the wood of\r\nany other elm, or they may refer to the tawny pubescence on the young\r\nshoots in winter. The botanical name describes that characteristic.\r\n\r\nIn the North, the slippery elm is sometimes known as moose elm. It\r\nfurnishes forage in winter for the moose and other herbivorous animals\r\nwhen ground plants are covered with snow. The moose is able to eat\r\nbranches as thick as a man’s thumb. The principal food element in the\r\ntwigs is the mucilaginous inner bark. It is this which gives the tree\r\nits name slippery elm. The value of the bark as a food has been\r\nquestioned. It is agreeable to the taste of both man and beast, but it\r\nis claimed that a human being will starve to death on it, though it will\r\nprolong life several days. The lower animals, however, seem able to\r\nderive more benefit from eating the bark. An incident of the War of 1812\r\nappears to prove this. The army under General Harrison, operating in the\r\nvicinity of Lake Erie, kept the horses of the expedition alive by\r\nfeeding them on slippery elm bark, stripped from the trees and chopped\r\nin small bits.\r\n\r\nThe inner bark has long been used for medicinal purposes. It is now\r\nground fine and is kept for sale in drug stores, but formerly it was a\r\nhousehold remedy which most families in the country provided and kept in\r\nstore along with catnip, mandrake, sage, dogwood blossoms, and other\r\nrural remedies which were depended upon to rout diseases in the days\r\nwhen physicians were few. The slippery elm bark was peeled from the tree\r\nin long strips, the rough outer layers were shaved off, leaving the\r\nmucilaginous inner layer. That was from an eighth to a quarter of an\r\ninch thick. It was dried and put away for use. When needed it was\r\npounded to a pulp, moistened with water, and applied as a poultice, if\r\nan external remedy was wanted. If a medicine was needed, a decoction was\r\ndrunk as tea. There is no question that the remedy often produced good\r\nresults when no doctor was within reach. A well-known medical writer\r\nsaid three-quarters of a century ago that the slippery elm tree was\r\nworth its weight in gold.\r\n\r\nThe range of slippery elm extends from the lower St. Lawrence river\r\nthrough Canada to North Dakota. It is found in Texas as far west as the\r\nSan Antonio river, and its western limit is generally from 200 to 300\r\nmiles west of the Mississippi river. Its range extends south nearly to\r\nthe Gulf of Mexico. It is not this tree’s habit to grow in thick stands,\r\nbut it occurs singly or in small groups on the banks of streams or on\r\nrich hillsides.\r\n\r\nThe average size is scarcely half that of white elm. Few trees exceed a\r\nheight of seventy feet and a diameter of two. It grows rapidly at first,\r\nbut does not live to old age. The crown lacks the symmetry and beauty so\r\nconspicuous in white elm. The limbs follow no law of regularity, but\r\nleave the trunk at haphazard. The fruit is mature before the leaves are\r\nhalf grown. The seeds have more wing area than those of white elm; and,\r\nlike those of white elm, the wing surrounds the flat seed on all its\r\nedges. The leaves are rough to the touch, and when crumpled in the hand,\r\nthe crunching sensation is unpleasant.\r\n\r\nNext to white elm, slippery elm appears to be more abundant than any\r\nother member of the group; but statistics do not give the basis for\r\nclose estimates. The factories of Michigan use 3,700,000 feet of\r\nslippery elm a year, and 44,000,000 of white elm. The proportion of\r\nslippery to white is larger in the factories of Illinois.\r\n\r\nThe uses are the same as for other elms. The wood is rated more durable\r\nthan the others, but it is not in much demand for outdoor work where\r\nresistance to decay is an important consideration. It is sometimes set\r\nfor fence posts, but the results are scarcely satisfactory, particularly\r\nfor round posts which are largely sapwood. Posts sawed from the\r\nheartwood of large trees would do better. The deeper red of the\r\nheartwood gives it an advantage over the other elms for furniture and\r\nfinish where natural colors are shown; but this is not important because\r\nno elm’s natural color stands for much in the estimation of users of\r\nfine woods. The more common use of slippery elm is for boxes and\r\ncooperage. Next to red gum, it is employed in larger quantities for\r\ncooperage in Illinois than any other wood.\r\n\r\nThe supply is rapidly decreasing. The cut for lumber is the chief drain,\r\nbut a not inconsiderable one is the peeling of trees for bark. This goes\r\non all over the species’ range and much of it is done by boys with\r\nknives and hatchets. It is often hard to find slippery elms within miles\r\nof a town, because all have succumbed to bark hunters.\r\n\r\n    CEDAR ELM (_Ulmus crassifolia_) appears to bear this name because it\r\n    is often found associated with red cedars on the dry limestone hills\r\n    of Texas. There is little in the form and appearance of the tree to\r\n    suggest the tall, tapering conical crown of cedar. There is still\r\n    less in the wood. In some parts of Texas the species is called red\r\n    elm, on account of the color of the wood, while in Arkansas, which\r\n    is near the northern boundary of its range, it is locally known as\r\n    basket elm, because basket makers find desirable qualities in its\r\n    wood. It is a species of rather limited range, but it is abundant in\r\n    certain regions. It is found as far east as Sunflower river,\r\n    Mississippi, north into Arkansas, west to Pecos river, Texas, and\r\n    south into Mexico. It is confined to three states, this side the Rio\r\n    Grande. Trees on dry hills are inclined to be shrubby, but in damp\r\n    valleys where soil is fertile, specimens attain a height of eighty\r\n    feet and a diameter of three, but the average is not nearly so\r\n    large. The leaves are small but numerous. The flowering habits of\r\n    this elm are somewhat erratic. The usual time for bloom to appear is\r\n    August, and a month or six weeks afterwards the small seeds are\r\n    ready for flight; but occasionally, as if not satisfied with its\r\n    first effort, the tree blooms again in October, and ripens a second\r\n    crop late in the fall. The seeds are poorly supplied with wings,\r\n    which are reduced to narrow margins surrounding the seed. It does\r\n    not appear, however, that the species is in any way handicapped in\r\n    securing reproduction. The small shoots are equipped with flat,\r\n    corky keels, similar to but much smaller than those of the wing elm.\r\n\r\n    This tree is important for the lumber it produces. It is the common\r\n    and most abundant elm of Texas, and it is found in a large part of\r\n    that state. The wood is the weakest of the elms, and is likewise\r\n    quite brittle; but in the region where it is most abundant it\r\n    compares favorably with any other. The best is cut from the largest\r\n    trees, which grow in valleys where moisture is abundant. The growth\r\n    found on the dry hills is of poor quality, and is worth little, even\r\n    for fuel. The highest development in Texas, and also the highest in\r\n    the species’ range, is in the valleys of Trinity and Guadalupe\r\n    rivers. In Texas this wood is employed in furniture factories as\r\n    inside frames, to be covered by other woods, but it is not employed\r\n    as outside parts of furniture, unless in very cheap kinds. It is\r\n    suitable for drain boards and floors of refrigerators where it is\r\n    wet much of the time. Under such circumstances it is more easily\r\n    kept clean than most other woods. It whitens with repeated\r\n    scrubbings. One of its most common uses in Texas is for wagon hubs.\r\n    Some wheelwrights pronounce it next to the best native wood for that\r\n    purpose, the first place being accorded Osage orange. The tree is\r\n    often planted for shade along the streets of Texas towns, and\r\n    develops thick crowns and satisfactory forms.\r\n\r\n    RED ELM (_Ulmus serotina_) is a lately discovered member of the elm\r\n    family. It so closely resembles the cork elm that it was supposed to\r\n    be of the same species, and the close scrutiny of a botanist was\r\n    required to discover that it was a separate species. Sargent\r\n    observed the flowers opening in September while those of cork elm\r\n    appear in early spring. The seeds ripen in November, while cork\r\n    elm’s are ripe early in the summer. The tree was named red elm, the\r\n    wood being reddish-brown. That name is widely applied to slippery\r\n    elm, but it is improbable that much confusion will result. The red\r\n    elm’s range is quite restricted and in that area the slippery elm is\r\n    not important. Red elm occurs on limestone hills and river banks\r\n    from central Kentucky to northern Georgia and Alabama. It attains a\r\n    height of fifty or sixty feet and a diameter of two or three. The\r\n    leaves are from two to four inches in length, and one or two wide,\r\n    with margins toothed like the other elms. The midrib is yellow, and\r\n    in the autumn the leaves change to an orange yellow before falling.\r\n    Branches which are two or three years old develop corky wings, two\r\n    or three in number.\r\n\r\n    It is not known that mechanical tests of the wood have been made in\r\n    a regular way to determine its physical properties, but superficial\r\n    examination indicates that it is hard, tough, and strong, apparently\r\n    about the same as cork elm. Special lists of uses for this wood have\r\n    not been compiled for the reason that lumbermen and operators of\r\n    sawmills have never distinguished it from other elms of the region.\r\n    Since it has never been left standing in districts where other elms\r\n    are cut, it is evident that it has been regularly put to use for\r\n    vehicles, agricultural implements, boxes, crates, and slack\r\n    cooperage, because such articles have been manufactured in the\r\n    region. The red elm has been occasionally planted as a shade tree\r\n    along streets of towns in northern Georgia and Alabama.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPLANERTREE\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLANERTREE]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPLANERTREE\r\n\r\n(_Planera Aquatica_)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis tree is a first cousin of the elms, but it is no more an elm than a\r\nhackberry is an elm. It is a member of the family but is of a different\r\ngenus, and it is the sole representative of its genus in the known\r\nworld. There is only one kind of planertree, with no nearer relatives\r\nthan the elms on one side and hackberry, sugarberry, and palo blanco on\r\nthe other. Except those kinsfolk, it is alone on earth. The name is in\r\nhonor of Johann Jacob Planer, a German botanist whose efforts did much\r\nfor science nearly two hundred years ago. The name of the species\r\n_aquatica_, recognizes the tree’s habit of growing where water is\r\nabundant. It is a swamp species, or rather, it prefers situations\r\nsubject to periodic overflow. It looks like an elm, and that has led\r\npeople to call it water elm. That is the name by which it is usually\r\nknown in Florida. In Alabama it is called the American planertree, which\r\nis an unnecessary restriction, since there is no planertree except this\r\none. The Louisiana French gave it the name plene, and the abridgement of\r\nits name is yet heard in that state. In North Carolina it has acquired\r\nthe name sycamore, but without good reason. It does not look in the\r\nleast like sycamore.\r\n\r\nIt has the leaf of an elm, and it resembles that tree in bark, and\r\nsomewhat in general form. The layman detects the first important\r\ndifference when he examines the seeds. Those of the elms have wings, but\r\nthe planertree’s are without those appendages, and they would be useless\r\nif it had them, unless they were as large as the parachute of the\r\nbasswood seed. The planertree bears a sort of nut, a third of an inch\r\nlong, and too heavy to be transported far on the ordinary membranous\r\nwings of tree seeds. Water is doubtless the principal agent in carrying\r\nthe seeds from place to place. Probably few of them are transported far,\r\nbecause the water about the trees is generally stagnant; and, besides,\r\nthe species does not seem to be extending its range or increasing in\r\nnumbers.\r\n\r\nThe planertree has a history. If the terms which the Roman historian\r\nTacitus applied to people, could be applied to trees, it might be said\r\nof this species, as he said of certain tribes: “The cowards fly the\r\nfarthest and are the last survivors.” The planertree is now found only\r\nin certain southern swamps, from North Carolina to Florida, and west to\r\nMissouri and Texas. In former periods, as is shown by the records of\r\ngeology, there were several species, and they had a wide range over\r\nportions of the northern hemisphere. They appear to have been a strong\r\ngroup of trees, able to hold their ground with the best inhabitants of\r\nthe forest. They were in the Rocky Mountains, and far north in Alaska.\r\nThey were in Europe also, or were represented there by some very similar\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nFor some reason which is not definitely known, they lost out when\r\ncompetition with other trees became keen, and in the course of long\r\nperiods of time they disappeared from their former ranges in the North\r\nand West. They took to the swamps, just as the tribes of which Tacitus\r\nspoke, took to the morasses when they could no longer face their enemies\r\non open ground. It was a far cry from Alaska to the Chattahoochee swamps\r\nin Florida, yet that was where A. H. Curtis and Charles Mohr went to\r\nprocure typical planertree specimens for the tests which Sargent made of\r\nAmerican woods.\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested that tree species which have lost out in\r\ncompetition for ground, have been those which were at some decided\r\ndisadvantage in the matter of getting their seeds properly scattered and\r\nplanted. The case has not been proved, because there are as many facts\r\nand as much argument against that hypothesis as for it. The bigtrees of\r\nCalifornia are a noted example of a species which lost out and retreated\r\nto a corner, yet their seeds fly like birds. Plainly, something besides\r\nwinged seeds is needed to keep the species in the fight. However, it is\r\nnot difficult to see that the planertree, with wingless seeds and of so\r\nlittle use as food that no bird or rodent will carry them or bury them,\r\nhas been much handicapped in the long contest which has crowded it from\r\nthe arctic circle to the cotton belt.\r\n\r\nIt has the habits of the subdued and conquered tree. It has adapted\r\nitself to swamps where few species can grow, and where competition for\r\nlight and room is reduced to a minimum. Yet, even there, it is content\r\nto take the leavings of more ambitious species. The crowns make little\r\neffort to rise up to the light, for which many other trees battle during\r\ntheir whole existence. The planertree’s low, broad top of contorted\r\nbranches places it perpetually in the shade of any other trees which\r\novertop it.\r\n\r\nThe wood of the planertree is lighter in weight, poorer in fuel value,\r\nweaker, and more brittle than the poorest of the elms. The annual ring\r\nlacks the rows of large open pores common in all the elms, but it has\r\nmany small pores scattered through the whole year’s growth. It is not\r\neasy to note a difference between the springwood and that which grows\r\nlater. The wood is soft, light brown in color, and the nearly white\r\nsapwood is thick. It is often, perhaps generally, a tree of fairly rapid\r\ngrowth, and since it does not reach large size, it is probably\r\nshort-lived, but exact information along that line is lacking.\r\n\r\nThe tallest trees seldom exceed a height of forty feet and a diameter of\r\ntwo. It is evident that a tree of that size and form does not tempt the\r\nlumberman to much exertion to procure it. An examination of reports of\r\nsawmill operations and of the utilization of woods by shops and\r\nfactories in the southern states has failed to find a single instance\r\nwhere the planertree has been reported in use for any purpose whatever.\r\nDoubtless, trees are sometimes cut and the lumber gets into the market,\r\nbut not under its own name. The species is interesting for reasons other\r\nthan that it ever has had or ever can have a place in the country’s\r\nlumber industry.\r\n\r\n    WING ELM (_Ulmus alata_), which is the smallest of the elms, is\r\n    plentifully supplied with names, but in most parts of its range it\r\n    is known as wing or winged elm. It is also called wahoo or wahoo\r\n    elm, and the West Virginians have named it witch elm; the North\r\n    Carolinans refer to it often as simply elm; from Florida to Texas\r\n    some call it cork elm; in Alabama it is water elm; in Arkansas\r\n    mountain elm; while in other regions it is corky elm, small-leaf\r\n    elm, and red elm. Some of these names are self-explanatory. Wing elm\r\n    does not relate to a winged seed, but to winged twigs. That\r\n    characteristic of the tree is very prominent. The wings consist of\r\n    flattened keels along opposite sides of the branches. A twig no more\r\n    than a quarter of an inch in diameter may be decorated with wings\r\n    half an inch or more wide, making the twig four or five times as\r\n    wide as it is thick. As the twig enlarges, the wings do not broaden\r\n    in proportion. The lowest branches and those nearest the trunk are\r\n    most generously furnished with wings. They appear to be entirely\r\n    ornamental, for it is not known that they serve any useful purpose.\r\n    The growth is different from those which give cork elm its name. The\r\n    latter occur on the large branches, often in the form of isolated\r\n    protuberances, but the wings are fairly continuous for a foot or\r\n    more, except that they terminate abruptly at the nodes, but\r\n    recommence immediately after. Branches less than a year old seldom\r\n    have wings. The name wahoo appears to have lost its etymology if it\r\n    ever had any. Dictionaries tell what it means, but they shy at its\r\n    origin. It is a southern word which is applied to this elm, and also\r\n    to other trees, and occasionally it means a fish instead of a tree.\r\n    Some would trace it to the cry of an owl, others to a name in\r\n    Gulliver’s Travels, with a slight change in spelling.\r\n\r\n    Wing elm at its best is about fifty feet high and two in diameter;\r\n    but much of the stand is small. The best occurs west of the\r\n    Mississippi river. The range extends from Texas to Virginia, south\r\n    to Florida, and north to Illinois. In Texas it is a fairly important\r\n    wood in furniture factories, the annual supply being about a million\r\n    feet. It is used by turners for table legs. In an investigation of\r\n    the uses of the wood, the same difficulty is encountered that makes\r\n    difficult a study of the uses of all the elms--conflict and\r\n    uncertainty of names. There are few regions in the hardwood areas of\r\n    this country which produce one elm and no more; and after all\r\n    practical means of identification are resorted to, there is often\r\n    doubt and uncertainty concerning the exact species of elm lumber\r\n    found in use. Fortunately, it generally makes little difference,\r\n    because anyone of them is good enough for ordinary use. Wing elm is\r\n    extensively planted for shade along the streets of towns in the\r\n    lower Mississippi valley, but more frequently on the west side of\r\n    the valley. When the trees grow in the open they develop broad\r\n    crowns, and the branches, even of comparatively small trees, are\r\n    long enough to reach well over the sidewalks, and cast satisfactory\r\n    shade. The dark-colored winged twigs add much to the ornamental\r\n    value of the street trees.\r\n\r\n    FREMONTIA (_Fremontodendron californicum_) is not botanically in the\r\n    elm family, but it is popularly known as slippery elm in the region\r\n    where it occurs, and for that reason it is here given place among\r\n    the elms. It is known also as leatherwood. It is a California\r\n    species, ranging among the lower mountains and higher foothills in\r\n    dry, gravelly soils, from the Mexican boundary five hundred miles\r\n    northward in the state. The mucilaginous inner bark tastes like that\r\n    of the true slippery elm. The shape of the leaf much more resembles\r\n    sycamore than elm; and it is an evergreen. It bears a bright yellow,\r\n    roselike flower, and the seeds are small, reddish-brown. The wood is\r\n    fine grained, clear reddish-brown, with thick, whitish sapwood. It\r\n    is very soft. The tree attains its largest size among the foothills\r\n    of the Sierra Nevada mountains, but even there it is too small to\r\n    have much economic value, seldom exceeding thirty feet in height and\r\n    a foot in diameter. Its most important use is as a forage plant for\r\n    cattle and sheep. In that particular it resembles slippery elm in\r\n    northern woods. The tree is occasionally planted in the eastern\r\n    states and in Europe for ornament. In its native range it grows\r\n    slowly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHACKBERRY\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HACKBERRY]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHACKBERRY\r\n\r\n(_Celtis Occidentalis_)\r\n\r\n\r\nHackberry is a common name for this tree in nearly all parts of its\r\nrange, but it has other names. It is sometimes confused with sugarberry\r\n(_Celtis mississippiensis_). They call it nettle tree in Rhode Island,\r\nMassachusetts, Delaware, and Michigan, and in Tennessee it is known as\r\nAmerican nettle-tree. In Vermont it is hoop ash; in Rhode Island\r\none-berry; hack-tree in Minnesota, and juniper tree in New Jersey.\r\n\r\nThe name hackberry is not of American origin. It dates far back in the\r\nlanguages of western Europe and is believed to have the same origin as\r\nthe word haw, which, in its turn meant hedge. If that etymology is\r\ncorrect, the word really means hedge berry, which is not an\r\ninappropriate name for the tree. The name is sometimes applied to a\r\nsmall bird cherry in Europe. The New Jersey name juniper-tree is in\r\nrecognition of the resemblance of the berries to those of red cedar or\r\nred juniper. No reason has been assigned for the name nettle-tree.\r\n\r\nIts range covers about 2,000,000 square miles in the United States\r\nbesides part of Canada. It grows from the Atlantic on the coast of New\r\nEngland to the tide water of the Pacific on Puget sound; in southern\r\nFlorida and in Texas. It is not found in pure stands, but often as\r\nsingle trees far apart. This is the case in the northeastern part of the\r\nUnited States in particular where probably not more than one tree might\r\nbe found in a whole county. Frequently the people in the neighborhood do\r\nnot know what the tree is, and suppose it is the last representative on\r\nearth of some disappearing species.\r\n\r\nIt is far from being a disappearing tree. Not only is it widely\r\ndispersed over the United States, but related species are scattered\r\nthrough many countries of the old world, from Denmark to India. There\r\nare said to be between fifty and sixty species, only two of which are in\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nIt has been claimed by scholars that the lotus referred to by ancient\r\nwriters was the hackberry. It was reputed to cause forgetfulness when\r\neaten, but the claim was fictitious, for the fruit does not produce that\r\neffect. It is not now regarded as human food. Tennyson deals with the\r\nfiction very beautifully in the poem “Lotus Eaters,” but he took\r\nliberties with botany when he represented fruit and flowers on the same\r\nbranch; for, though the berries hang several months, they drop before\r\nthe next season’s flowers appear.\r\n\r\nThe hackberry belongs to the elm family, being of the same relation as\r\nthe planertree. The leaves resemble those of the elm, but are more\r\nsharply pointed. The fruit is usually classed as a berry. It ripens in\r\nSeptember and October, but remains on the tree several months, becoming\r\ndry. It is about one-fourth inch long, dark purple, with a tough, thick\r\nskin, and with flesh dark orange. Most of the pale brown seeds are eaten\r\nby birds.\r\n\r\nThe tree varies greatly in size. In some remote corners of its immense\r\nrange it is little more than a shrub, while at its best it may attain a\r\nheight of 100 feet and a diameter of three or four. Its average size is\r\nabout that of slippery elm. The bark varies as much in appearance as the\r\ntree in size. Sometimes it has the smooth surface and pale bluish-green\r\nappearance that suggest the bark of beech; again it is darker and\r\nrougher, like the elm. It frequently exhibits the harsh warty bark which\r\nis peculiar to the hackberry, and when present it is a pretty safe means\r\nof identification. The warts may be conical, oblong, or sharp-pointed,\r\nand probably an inch in height. When closely examined, most of them are\r\nfound to consist of parallel strata of bark which may usually be pulled\r\noff without much difficulty. The warts are a decided disadvantage to the\r\ntree in some of the low swampy districts of Louisiana where Spanish moss\r\nis a pest. This moss (which is not a true moss), is propagated\r\nprincipally by tufts and strands which are carried by wind until they\r\nfind anchorage among the branches of trees where they increase and\r\nmultiply at a rapid rate until they finally smother or break down the\r\nunfortunate tree which supplied a lodging place. The hackberry’s warts\r\ncatch and hold every flying strand of moss that touches them, and\r\nhundreds, perhaps thousands of pounds of it may accumulate on a single\r\ntree. The grayish-green color of the moss often exactly matches the hue\r\nof the tree’s bark.\r\n\r\nThe reported annual cut of hackberry lumber in the United States is less\r\nthan 5,000,000 feet. That can be only a fraction of the total output.\r\nFew mills report it separately, but list it as ash. The wood looks more\r\nlike ash than elm. It is heavy, but only moderately hard and strong. Its\r\ncolor is more yellowish than ash, but the annual rings of growth\r\nresemble that wood. The sapwood is thick, and growth is rapid where\r\nconditions are favorable.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtless used by industries in thirty states or more, but\r\ncomparatively few factories report it. In Texas it is listed in the box\r\nand crate industry. In Louisiana it rises to more importance, for that\r\nis the region where the tree attains its best. Slack coopers make kegs,\r\ntubs, and barrels of it; vehicle manufacturers convert it into parts of\r\nbuggy tops and the running gears of wagons; it serves for furniture and\r\ninterior finish; and it takes the place of ash for hoe handles and parts\r\nof agricultural implements. The uses are nearly the same in\r\nMississippi, but it is used there for rustic seats and other outdoor\r\nfurniture. In Missouri it is found suitable for cart axles, saddle\r\ntrees, stitching horse jaws, and wagon beds. In Arkansas it goes with\r\nash into flooring, and interior finish for houses. Illinois builders\r\nwork it into fixtures for stores. In Michigan it serves the same\r\npurposes as in Texas, baskets, boxes, and crates. These examples\r\ndoubtless are representative of its uses wherever the tree is found in\r\ncommercial quantities. The wood is not durable in contact with the soil.\r\nIt is also liable to attack by boring insects if logs are allowed to\r\nretain their bark.\r\n\r\nThe hackberry has been planted to a small extent as a street tree in the\r\nsouthern towns, but it is not as popular as the elms and oaks. It will\r\nnever occupy a more important position in the country’s lumber industry\r\nthan it holds at present. It is a tree which, for some reason, inspires\r\nlittle enthusiasm in anybody; but nature takes care of it fairly well,\r\nand the small sweet drupes which it bears are a guarantee that the\r\nspecies will not want for seed carriers as long as birds continue to\r\nhave access to its branches in winter.\r\n\r\nSUGARBERRY (_Celtis mississippiensis_) is frequently mistaken for\r\nhackberry even by persons who ought to be able to distinguish them.\r\nBotanists formerly confused the two, and probably some insist still that\r\nsugarberry is only a variety of hackberry. The leaves generally have\r\nsmooth margins, and that would differentiate the tree from the hackberry\r\nwere it not that sometimes the sugarberry has serrate leaves. The drupes\r\nare bright orange red and are usually smaller than the purple fruit of\r\nhackberry. As for the wood of the two species, it is not easy to tell\r\none from the other. The sugarberry’s range is not one-third as extensive\r\nas hackberry’s, but covers some hundreds of thousands of square miles in\r\nthe southeastern quarter of the United States. Its northern limit is in\r\nIllinois and Indiana where it occupies rich bottom lands and the banks\r\nof streams. It reaches its largest size in the lower Ohio river basin,\r\ngrows southward into Florida and west into Texas, Arkansas, and\r\nMissouri. It crosses the Rio Grande into Mexico, appearing to outstrip\r\nthe hackberry in that direction. It outstrips it in another direction\r\nalso, for it is found in the Bermuda islands. The French of Louisiana\r\ncalled it bois inconnu, or the unknown wood.\r\n\r\nThis tree shows a marked tendency to run into varieties, and cultivation\r\nwould probably develop the tendency. The differences between the species\r\nand the varieties are plain enough to the systematic botanist, but are\r\nsuch that the lumberman or other ordinary observer would scarcely notice\r\nthem. The variety which has been named _Celtis mississippiensis\r\nreticulata_, but without any English name except sugarberry, is a tree\r\nforty or fifty feet high, covered with blue-gray bark, very rough. It\r\nranges from Dallas, Texas, to the Rio Grande and westward into New\r\nMexico, Arizona, and Utah, and into southern California and Lower\r\nCalifornia. In eastern Texas it is found on dry limestone hills, but\r\nwestward only in mountain canyons in the vicinity of water. In the\r\nsouthern part of Texas this tree is usually known as palo blanco, but\r\nthose who apply that name have no idea that it is a variety of\r\nsugarberry but suppose it is a tree peculiar to their region. In Cameron\r\nand Hidalgo counties, Texas, either because an extra good quality grows\r\nthere, or because some opinion exists in its favor, it is liked for\r\nwagon material, and occasionally is turned for table legs and other\r\nparts of furniture. It is quite common in that part of Texas as an\r\nornamental tree in yards and along streets of small towns. The whiteness\r\nof the bark is the most striking feature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHITE ASH\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHITE ASH]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHITE ASH\r\n\r\n(_Fraxinus Americana_)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis tree is generally called white or gray ash, or simply ash. American\r\nash is a translation of its botanical name and is not often used in\r\nbusiness transactions in this country. In some parts of the South the\r\nterm cane ash is occasionally employed, but there seems to be no\r\nagreement among those who use the name as to what it means. This is the\r\ncommon ash in the lumber trade. There are more than a dozen species in\r\nthe United States, but white ash goes to market in larger amounts than\r\nall others together. This is known in a general way, but exact figures\r\ncannot be given, because statistics of the cut of different species of\r\nash are not kept separate.\r\n\r\nThe range of this tree covers at least a million square miles, and all\r\nor part of every state east of the Mississippi river and west of it from\r\nNebraska to Texas. It is reported cut for lumber in thirty states. The\r\nvarious ashes are lumbered in thirty-nine states. Ash does not occur in\r\npure stands but is scattered in forests of other species, sometimes\r\ngrowing in small clumps. It is difficult to name an average size for the\r\ntree, because climate and soil control the growth over a large area\r\nwhere conditions vary. Trees 120 feet high and six feet in diameter are\r\nsaid to have stood in the primeval forests in the lower Ohio valley; but\r\nlogs four feet through are seldom seen now. Trees seventy or eighty feet\r\nhigh and three in diameter are above the average in any region where\r\nthis tree is now lumbered. Some of the old planted trees of New England\r\nare five or six feet through, and are finely proportioned, but growing\r\nas they do in the open, they have larger crowns than are found in forest\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\nAll species of ash have compound leaves, and those of white ash are from\r\neight to twelve inches long. The under sides of the leaflets are white,\r\nand some persons have this fact in mind when they call the species white\r\nash, while others refer to the bark, and still others to the wood. It is\r\na characteristic of the tree that most of the leaves grow near the ends\r\nof the limbs. For that reason the crown appears open when viewed from\r\nbelow, and the larger limbs and branches are naked. The leaves demand\r\nlight, and they arrange themselves on the extremities of the limbs to\r\nget it. When the tree is crowded, it sheds its lower limbs and its crown\r\nrises rapidly until it reaches abundance of light. This produces long\r\ntrunks in forests.\r\n\r\nThe boles are often not quite straight, but have several slight crooks,\r\nyet keep close to a general perpendicular line. That form is due to a\r\npeculiarity of growth. The leading shoot of a growing ash has more than\r\none terminal bud. If a side bud pushes ahead, the stem leans a little in\r\nthat direction; next, a bud on the other side may gain the ascendancy,\r\nproducing a slight lean for a few years in that direction; or two side\r\nbuds may develop simultaneously, causing a forked trunk. Mature trees\r\noften carry the history of these peculiarities of growth.\r\n\r\nThe seeds of white ash are equipped for moderate flight. The wing is\r\nlarge, but the seed attached to the end of it is heavy enough to give it\r\na sharp tilt downward when it begins its flight through the air, and it\r\ngenerally shoots at a steep angle toward the ground. It is not apt to\r\nwhirl through the air with a gliding motion like a maple seed.\r\nConsequently, ash seeds are not great travelers. They are dispersed with\r\neconomy, however, for all do not come down at once, but many hang on the\r\ntree for months, and a few go with every strong wind, thus getting\r\nthemselves scattered in every direction. Their power of germination is\r\nlow, and only about forty per cent of seeds are fertile. This is due to\r\nthe fact that pistillate and staminate flowers do not grow on the same\r\ntree, and fertilization is imperfect.\r\n\r\nThe importance of ash in the industries of the country does not depend\r\non the quantity but the quality of the wood. Although the various\r\nspecies are produced in thirty-nine states, as shown by mill statistics,\r\nthe total yield is less than 250,000,000 feet a year. That is exceeded\r\nby several woods, among them hickory, elm, beech, basswood, chestnut,\r\nand even larch.\r\n\r\nThe wood of ash which has grown rapidly is generally considered superior\r\nto that of slow growth. The reason is found in the fact that trees of\r\nslow growth do most of their growing early in the season, and the wood\r\nis porous; but trees of rapid growth lay summerwood on abundantly, and\r\nit is dense. Few species show a sharper line between spring and\r\nsummerwood than ash, for which reason the annual rings are clear-cut and\r\ndistinct. What figure ash has is produced by the growth rings, and not\r\nby medullary rays. Quarter-sawing brings out no additional beauty.\r\nSlight crooks in many logs produce a moderate cross grain in lumber,\r\nwhich gives to finished ash its characteristic figure or grain. When\r\nstraight-grained wood is wanted, as when it is for tool handles and\r\noars, logs without crooks are selected.\r\n\r\nThe wood of white ash is heavy, hard, strong, elastic, but rather\r\nbrittle. It lacks the toughness of hickory. The medullary rays are\r\nnumerous, but small and obscure. The color is brown, the sapwood much\r\nlighter, often nearly white. It is not durable in contact with the soil.\r\nNotwithstanding its name, the wood rates low in ash, and its fuel value\r\nis under that of white oak. The states which produce the largest yearly\r\ncut of this species are, ranging downward in the order named: Arkansas,\r\nOhio, Wisconsin, Kentucky, Indiana, Michigan, and Tennessee.\r\n\r\nThe uses of white ash are so numerous that they can be presented only in\r\nclasses. It goes into almost every wood-using industry, but in different\r\nsections of country certain uses lead. Thus in Illinois the makers of\r\nbutter tubs take more of it than any other industry; in Michigan\r\nautomobiles lead, and in Arkansas the handle factories are largest\r\nbuyers; in Louisiana boat oars consume most; in Alabama and Missouri car\r\nconstruction is in the lead; in Texas boxes and crates; in North\r\nCarolina wagons; in Kentucky handles; in Maryland musical instruments;\r\nand in Massachusetts furniture. The utilization of ash in these states,\r\nscattered over the eastern half of the United States, indicates fairly\r\nwell the wood’s most important lines of usefulness. A considerable\r\nquantity is made into flooring and interior finish. It is classed among\r\nsanitary woods, that is, it does not stain or taint food products by\r\ncontact.\r\n\r\nThe total quantity of merchantable white ash in the country is not\r\nknown, but there is still enough to meet demand, and the extent of the\r\ntree’s range makes supplies convenient in nearly all manufacturing\r\nstates. The species grows rather rapidly, and trees a hundred or a\r\nhundred and fifty years old yield logs of good size.\r\n\r\nTEXAS ASH (_Fraxinus texensis_) has been regarded by some as a variety\r\nof white ash, while others, including Sudworth and Sargent, consider it\r\na distinct species. It is often called mountain ash where it occurs\r\namong the mountains of western Texas. Its range lies wholly in that\r\nstate, and extends from the vicinity of Dallas to the valley of Devil’s\r\nriver. The compound leaves are smaller than those of white ash, and are\r\nusually composed of five leaflets. The winged seeds ripen in May, and\r\nare an inch or less in length. The largest trees are fifty feet high and\r\ntwo or three in diameter; but generally the trees are much smaller. The\r\nwood is strong, heavy, and hard. The annual rings are marked by one or\r\nmore rows of open ducts, and the medullary rays are inconspicuous. The\r\nheartwood is light brown, the sapwood lighter. This ash is employed\r\nwithin its range for various purposes, but it is not of sufficient\r\nabundance to constitute an important commodity. In market it is not\r\ndistinguished from white ash.\r\n\r\nGREGG ASH (_Fraxinus greggii_) has some peculiarities which make it\r\nworthy of mention as one of the minor species. Its range is in the dry\r\nmountains of western Texas where a number of ashes seem to have put in\r\nan appearance as members of the thinly-peopled vegetable kingdom of that\r\nregion. The compound leaves of Gregg ash are seldom three inches long,\r\nand the leaflets are often half an inch long and less than a quarter of\r\nan inch wide. The petioles are winged like the twigs of wing elm. The\r\nundersides of the leaves have small black dots. The winged seeds are as\r\nproportionately small as the leaves. The flowers have not been described\r\nby botanists, for the species is not well known. The largest trees are\r\nscarcely twenty-five feet high and eight inches in diameter. More\r\nfrequently they are shrubs from four to twelve feet tall. The wood is\r\nheavy, hard, brown in color and of slow growth.\r\n\r\nDWARF ASH (_Fraxinus anomala_) might be mistaken for some other species\r\nwere its telltale winged seeds missing. It has lost the leaflets from\r\nits compound leaf, and a single one remains. Occasionally, however, a\r\nstem bearing three leaflets is found. The seeds are equipped with wide,\r\noblong wings. It is a desert species, and the desolate surroundings of\r\nits habitat explain why nature has dispensed with as much foliage as\r\npossible. It is found in southwestern Colorado, in southern Utah, and on\r\nthe western slopes of the Charleston mountains in southern Nevada. Trees\r\nare small and the wood is not of much use for other than fuel, but a few\r\nsmall ranch timbers are made of it where other kinds are scarce. Trunks\r\nare usually not more than six or seven inches in diameter. The wood is\r\nheavy, hard, and light brown in color.\r\n\r\n    FRINGE ASH (_Fraxinus cuspidata_) has some difficulty in proving\r\n    that it is entitled to be called a tree in the United States, though\r\n    southward in Mexico its right to that title is unquestioned. It is\r\n    very small where its range extends over the dry ridges and rocky\r\n    slopes of southwestern Texas and southern New Mexico and Arizona.\r\n    Its compound leaves are five or seven inches long, and the leaflets\r\n    which number from three to seven have long, slender tips. The\r\n    trowel-shaped fruit is about one inch long. The wood resembles white\r\n    ash, but trunks of considerable size are not found. The name refers\r\n    to the flowers, and they give this small tree its value for\r\n    ornamental purposes. The flowers appear in April and are extremely\r\n    fragrant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBLACK ASH\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BLACK ASH]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBLACK ASH\r\n\r\n(_Fraxinus Nigra_)\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen George Washington was a surveyor locating land on the upper waters\r\nof the Potomac river, and westward on the Kanawha and Ohio rivers, he\r\nalways spoke of this ash as “hoop tree” when he marked it with two or\r\nwith three “hacks,” depending upon whether it designated a “corner” or a\r\n“line,” or a “pointer” in the system of surveying then in use. Trees\r\nwere used then as landmarks, and were duly recorded in the surveyor’s\r\nfield notes, and were described in the deeds when the title to the land\r\npassed from one party to another. It was not unusual, if subsequent\r\nlitigation came up, to cut blocks from marked trees to prove that such a\r\ncorner was at such a place. The “hacks” or ax marks, were sometimes\r\nhealed over and invisible at the bark, but were found deep in the wood.\r\nThe rings of growth covering the ax marks afforded an admissible record\r\nof the years that had passed since the survey was made. The selection of\r\nthe black ash as a landmark was one of the few instances in which\r\nWashington showed poor judgment; because it is a tree of short life, and\r\nmight be expected to die before a great many years.\r\n\r\nThe name hoop ash is applied to this tree yet. It has always been good\r\nmaterial for barrel hoops, because it splits into thin pieces, and is\r\nsufficiently tough. It is known as basket ash for the same reason. The\r\nNew England Indians were making fish baskets of it when the first white\r\npeople landed on those shores, and settlers speedily learned the art\r\nfrom the children of the wilderness. Those untutored savages knew little\r\nof wood technology, but they were able to take advantage of a\r\npeculiarity in the structure of black ash wood, which the white man’s\r\nmicroscope has revealed to him. The Indians doubtless discovered it\r\naccidentally. The springwood in the annual ring of black ash is made up\r\nof large pores, crowded so closely together that there is really very\r\nlittle actual wood substance there. In other words, the springwood is\r\nchiefly air spaces. The result is, that billets of black ash are easily\r\nseparated into thin strips, the cleavage following the weak lines of\r\nspringwood. A little beating and bending causes the annual rings to fall\r\napart. In some way the Indians found that out, and utilized their\r\nknowledge in manufacturing baskets in which to carry fish, acorns,\r\nhickory nuts, and other forest and water commodities.\r\n\r\nThe white people extended the scope of application to include chairs and\r\nother furniture in which splits are manipulated. It is worthy of note\r\nthat Indians made a similar discovery with northern white cedar or\r\narborvitæ, which separates into thin pieces by beating and bending.\r\nBarrel makers took advantage of the splitting properties of black ash to\r\nmake hoops of it, hence the name hoop ash, or hoop tree as Washington\r\ncalled it. The name basket ash has a similar origin.\r\n\r\nThe names swamp ash and water ash refer to situations in which the tree\r\ngrows best. It is one of the thirstiest inhabitants of the forest. Its\r\naggressive roots ramify through the soil and drink up the moisture so\r\nvoraciously that if water is not abundant, neighboring trees and plants\r\nmay find their roots robbed, and the functions of healthy growth will be\r\ninterfered with. This has led to a general belief that black ash poisons\r\ntrees that it touches. It simply robs their roots. Carolina and Lombardy\r\npoplars will sometimes do the same thing.\r\n\r\nThe name black ash by which this tree is now known in most regions where\r\nit grows refers to the color of the large, prominent, shiny, blue-black\r\nbuds in late winter and early spring; to the very dark green leaves in\r\nsummer--which at a distance resemble the foliage of post oak--and, to\r\nsome extent, to the dark brown color of the heartwood, though the wood\r\nis not always a safe means of identification if judged from superficial\r\nappearance only. The form of the tree assists in identifying it; for it\r\nis the slimmest of the ashes, in proportion to its height. Trunks three\r\nfeet through are heard of, but few persons have ever seen one much over\r\ntwenty inches, and many are about done growing when they are one foot in\r\ndiameter. Yet the trunks of such are very tall, perhaps seventy or\r\neighty feet. Their appearance has been likened to tall, slender columns\r\nof dark gray granite. They often stand so straight that a plummet line\r\nwill not reveal a deviation from the perpendicular.\r\n\r\nThe tree has been called elder-leaved ash. The form of the foliage has\r\nsomething to do with that name, but the odor more. Crush the leaves, and\r\nthey smell like elder. The compound leaves are from twelve to sixteen\r\ninches long; the leaflets range from seven to eleven in number, and the\r\nside leaflets have no stalks. The leaves appear late in spring, and they\r\nfall early in autumn. They drop with the butternut leaves, and like\r\nthem, all at once. The seed is winged, and the wing forms a margin\r\nentirely round the seed.\r\n\r\nThe wood of black ash is rather soft, moderately heavy, tough, but only\r\nmoderately strong, not durable in contact with the soil, dark brown in\r\ncolor with sapwood whiter. The species ranges farther north than any\r\nother ash, and grows in cold swamps and on the low banks of streams and\r\nlakes from Newfoundland to Winnipeg, and southward to Virginia, southern\r\nIllinois, southern Missouri, and Arkansas.\r\n\r\nBlack ash fills many important places in the country’s wood-using\r\nindustries, but the total quantity is not large. In 1910 Michigan\r\nmanufacturers reported the annual quantity in that state at 9,110,432\r\nfeet, and in Illinois the total was 9,936,000 feet. The uses for the\r\nwood in Michigan may be regarded as typical of the whole country. The\r\nreported uses were, auto seats, baskets, boat finish, butter tubs, candy\r\npails, carriage seats, crating, church pews, fish nets, office fixtures,\r\nflooring, furniture, ice chests, interior finish, jelly buckets, kitchen\r\ncabinets, lard tubs, piano frames, putty kegs, racked hoops, spice kegs,\r\ntin plate boxes, veneer, washboards, and woven splint boxes.\r\n\r\nBlack ash burls are characteristic excrescences on the trunk. They begin\r\nas small lumps or knobs under the bark, and never cease growing while\r\nthe tree lives. They may reach the dimensions of wash tubs, but most do\r\nnot exceed the size of a gallon measure. The grain of the wood is\r\nexceedingly distorted and involved. The burls are sliced or sawed in\r\nveneers which are much prized by cabinet makers. Early New Englanders\r\nmade bowls of them, which seldom checked or split during generations of\r\nservice. The burls are believed to be due to adventitious buds; that is,\r\nbuds which originate deep in the wood, but are never able to force their\r\nway through the bark. The internal structure of the ash burl indicates\r\nthat the buried bud grows, branches, and sends shoots in various\r\ndirections, but all of them are hopelessly enmeshed in the wood\r\nsubstance, and never are able to free themselves and burst through the\r\nbark. A constantly enlarging excrescence is the result.\r\n\r\nBLUE ASH (_Fraxinus quadrangulata_) is named from a blue dye procured\r\nfrom the inner bark. The botanical name relates to the square shape of\r\nthe young twigs, particularly the twigs of young trees, and was given by\r\nA. F. Michaux who found the species growing in the South. It reaches its\r\nbest development on the lower Wabash river in Indiana and Illinois and\r\non the Big Smoky mountains in Tennessee. Its northern limit reaches\r\nsouthern Michigan, its western is in Missouri. It is not abundant, if\r\nfound at all, east of the Appalachian mountains. Trees may reach a\r\nheight of 100 feet and a diameter of three, but about seventy is the\r\naverage height, with a diameter of two feet or less. The leaves resemble\r\nthose of black ash in form, but the foliage when seen in mass is\r\nyellow-green instead of dark green like that of black ash. The seeds\r\nlook like those of black ash. The tree bears perfect flowers, and in\r\nthat respect differs from most other species of ash.\r\n\r\nThe wood is heavier than that of any other member of the ash group,\r\nexcept Texas ash. It weighs about the same as white oak, which is six\r\npounds per cubic foot more than white ash weighs. In general appearance\r\nthe wood resembles white ash, but it is usually considered stronger and\r\nmore springy. The trunks of young trees are largely or entirely sapwood.\r\nSometimes no heartwood is formed until an age of seventy or eighty\r\nyears is reached. Many manufacturers of ash tool handles prefer this\r\nspecies to any other ash, because of its thick, white sapwood. It is\r\noften made into handles for hoes, rakes, shovels, pitchforks, spades,\r\nand snaths for scythes. Makers of vehicles draw liberally upon this wood\r\nwithin its range, as do furniture makers and the manufacturers of\r\nflooring. It is regarded as harder than white ash, and consequently\r\nbetter flooring material.\r\n\r\n    LEATHERLEAF ASH (_Fraxinus velutina_) changes its velvety leaves to\r\n    a leathery condition, hence the conflict in the meanings of its two\r\n    names. _Velutina_ means velvet-like. The compound leaves are seldom\r\n    six inches long, often not three, and they are made up of from three\r\n    to nine leaflets. The small seeds are equipped with wings. The tree\r\n    is small and would be without any commercial importance except that\r\n    it grows in an arid region where any wood is welcome. It is made\r\n    into ax, hammer, and pick handles, and wagon makers are often glad\r\n    to get it. It is found among the mountains and canyons of western\r\n    Texas, in New Mexico, Arizona, southern Nevada, and southeastern\r\n    California, near the shores of Owen’s lake. The largest trees are\r\n    scarcely forty feet high and eight inches in diameter. The wood is\r\n    not hard or strong, and is of slow growth. The largest trunks are\r\n    apt to be hollow. Sapwood is comparatively thick.\r\n\r\n    BERLANDIER ASH (_Fraxinus berlandieriana_) may not be entitled to a\r\n    place among native species, of the United States. Some suppose it\r\n    was introduced from Mexico by early Spanish settlers in western\r\n    Texas. It now grows wild there along Nueces and Blanco rivers where\r\n    specimens thirty feet high and a foot in diameter are found.\r\n    Southward in Mexico it is a popular street tree, and trunks reach\r\n    six or eight feet in diameter. The wood is soft and is used only\r\n    locally and in very small quantities.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOREGON ASH\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OREGON ASH]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOREGON ASH\r\n\r\n(_Fraxinus Oregona_)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis tree is unusual in that it has only one common name, and that is a\r\ntranslation of its botanical name which was given it by Nuttall who\r\nvisited the Pacific coast several years before the discovery of gold.\r\n\r\nThe moist bottom lands of southwestern Oregon are best suited to its\r\ngrowth, and here the best individuals and most abundant stands are\r\nfound. Moist soil and climate are essential to proper development of\r\nthis tree, and in such environment it is found from Puget Sound\r\nsouthward along the coast to San Francisco. A little further from the\r\ncoast it grows along the foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountains, to\r\nthe low mountains in San Diego and San Bernardino counties, California,\r\nin the southern extension of its range occupying a rather dry region.\r\n\r\nThe trunk grows to a height of eighty or 100 feet, and is often three\r\nfeet in diameter. It is covered with a gray-brown bark, exfoliating in\r\nflaky scales. The leaves are from five to fourteen inches long, and have\r\nfive or seven firm, light-green leaflets, finely toothed and bluntly\r\npointed. The flowers appear in April and May and are in compact\r\npanicles; the fruit in clusters, broadly winged and round pointed, and\r\nfrom one to two inches long.\r\n\r\nThe scarcity of good hardwoods on the Pacific coast gives this ash more\r\nimportance than it otherwise would have, and the importance which it\r\npossesses has been frequently overstated. It is not abundant of form and\r\nsize fitting it for lumber. It has long been cut in small quantities,\r\nbut never in large. The census returns for 1910 show that less than\r\n400,000 feet per year are reported in its entire range. Three-fourths of\r\nthis is sawed in Oregon, the remainder in Washington. Though the species\r\nhas a range of 800 miles north and south through California, no sawmill\r\nreported a foot of it. However, it is probable that census returns fail\r\nto do this wood full justice; for it is well known that considerable\r\nquantities are manufactured into articles without passing through\r\nsawmills. Chief among such commodities is slack cooperage. Butter tubs\r\nof Oregon ash are common. Much goes to wagon shops, and some of it\r\nwithout aid of sawmills.\r\n\r\nLittle or none of this wood is shipped outside its range, and its use is\r\nlocal. Boat builders work it into finish for cabins and upper parts, and\r\nsome serves as ribs. It is often seen as handles for picks, shovels,\r\nspades, pitchforks, and rakes. A little finds place, combined with other\r\nwoods, in office and store fixtures. Its grain resembles that of white\r\nash. It is not as heavy, and it is not believed to be as strong. It is\r\nhard, brittle, brown in color, with thick, lighter-colored sapwood.\r\nFurniture makers list it as shop material, and such is its largest\r\nreported use in Washington. A moderate amount is made into saddletrees\r\nand stirrups, and much is used as fuel.\r\n\r\nOregon ash has been planted for shade and ornament in both this country\r\nand Europe. It grows rapidly and develops a symmetrical crown. The habit\r\nit has of coming into leaf late in the spring and throwing its foliage\r\ndown early in autumn is held by some as a serious objection to it as an\r\nornamental tree; but it has compensating habits. It is remarkably free\r\nfrom disease, and, though leaves come late and go early, while its\r\nfoliage is on, it is healthy and vigorous. Reproduction is satisfactory\r\nin the tree’s wild state, and there is no danger that the species will\r\ndisappear. No movement has yet been made to plant this ash for\r\ncommercial timber growing.\r\n\r\nGREEN ASH (_Fraxinus lanceolata_) has been given that name on account of\r\nthe bright color of its foliage. It has other names, however, which\r\nindicate that its greenness is not always preëminently prominent. In\r\nIowa and Arkansas they call it blue ash; in Kansas and Nebraska white\r\nash; in some regions it is known as water ash, and elsewhere swamp ash.\r\nSome botanists do not regard it as a separate species but call it a\r\nvariety of red ash, but the consensus of opinion is that it is a\r\ndistinct species, though there appear to be connecting forms grading\r\nfrom red ash into green ash. Certain it is that the two are distinct\r\nenough in certain parts of the country. The range of green ash is more\r\nextensive than that of any other ash in this country. Beginning in\r\nVermont it passes southward to Florida; northwestward to the\r\nSaskatchewan river several hundred miles north of the international\r\nboundary line; along the base of the Rocky Mountains and over the ranges\r\nto Arizona, and through Texas. This includes more than half of the area\r\nof the United States. Notwithstanding a range so extensive, the total\r\nquantity of green ash timber in the country is not large. No pure\r\nforests or extensive stands exist. Trees are widely dispersed, and when\r\nlumbermen cut them, the wood is sold as some other, usually as white\r\nash. The wood has the general characters of red ash. It weighs about\r\nforty-four pounds per cubic foot of dry wood; is moderately strong,\r\nfairly stiff and elastic, and, like other species of ash, it is not\r\ndurable in contact with the soil.\r\n\r\nGreen ash is more planted than any other in the cold and dry regions of\r\nthe West and Northwest. It is a prairie tree and is found along highways\r\nand in door yards from Kansas northward into British America. It stands\r\ndrought better than any other ash, and resists cold fully as well, and\r\nyet it endures the warm weather and the rains of the South and\r\nflourishes there. It is not a large tree, but of sufficient size for use\r\nas furniture, finish, and vehicle making. It is seldom listed in\r\nstatistics of woods which go to sawmills, yet it is known that a good\r\nmany logs find their way to mills, while wagon makers and slack coopers\r\nemploy it in producing their commodities. The tree is an abundant\r\nseeder, and the seeds continue to fall during most of the winter.\r\n\r\n    RED ASH (_Fraxinus pennsylvanica_) is neither a large tree nor very\r\n    abundant, yet it has a wide range and is put to use wherever\r\n    lumbermen find it convenient. The lumber generally passes in the\r\n    market as white ash, and for most purposes it is as good, but is\r\n    rated lower than that wood in elasticity. It is called brown ash in\r\n    Maine, black ash in New Jersey, river ash in Rhode Island. The last\r\n    name is bestowed because the tree prefers moist land near rivers and\r\n    ponds, and largest specimens are found in such situations, where it\r\n    is often an associate of black ash and is frequently mistaken for\r\n    it, though it should not be difficult to tell the species apart. A\r\n    slight reddish tinge sometimes shows on the outer bark; the inner\r\n    layer of bark is reddish; the small twigs and the under sides of\r\n    leaves are clothed with hairs which sometimes suggest redness; and\r\n    the heartwood is reddish-brown. Persons who speak of the tree as red\r\n    ash probably have one or more of those characteristics in mind. As a\r\n    tree it has no striking peculiarities. Its usual height is forty or\r\n    sixty feet; its diameter from fifteen to twenty inches; its compound\r\n    leaves ten or twelve inches long, with seven or nine leaflets; its\r\n    seeds one or two inches in length, narrow, and sharply pointed, with\r\n    slender, graceful wing.\r\n\r\n    The range of red ash is from New Brunswick to Dakota, and from\r\n    Florida to Alabama, with all of the included region of a million\r\n    square miles. It attains its best development in the north Atlantic\r\n    states, while it is usually inferior west of the Alleghany\r\n    mountains. It develops a broad crown in open ground, but even there\r\n    its lower limbs die and drop, while in forests the trunk grows tall\r\n    and the crown is reduced. It is planted for shade and ornament, but\r\n    it seems to have no superiority over white ash for that purpose.\r\n    Some of the Michigan manufacturers list red ash separately in their\r\n    factories, and apparently this is not done elsewhere in the country.\r\n    About three-quarters of a million feet a year are used in that\r\n    state, and since uses there are doubtless typical of uses in the\r\n    country generally, the list possesses importance: Automobile frames,\r\n    boxes, butter tubs, crates, eveners, flooring, furniture, interior\r\n    finish, neck yokes, singletrees, wagon poles. Farther east in early\r\n    times red ash was occasionally split for fence rails, but that use\r\n    is important now only as history.\r\n\r\n    PUMPKIN ASH (_Fraxinus profunda_) is a tree of peculiar interest. It\r\n    was unknown before 1893, though the region had been settled over a\r\n    hundred years. It has the largest leaves, largest fruit, and largest\r\n    swelled base of all American ashes. Notwithstanding that, it\r\n    remained so deeply hidden in swamps that it escaped discovery. The\r\n    botanical name refers to the deep swamps in which the tree chooses\r\n    its habitation. Its great, swelled base enables it to stand on the\r\n    soft mud of lagoon bottoms, and the abnormal swelling is ribbed like\r\n    a pumpkin, hence the only English name the tree has ever had. These\r\n    are not the only remarkable things connected with this ash. Its\r\n    range includes three or four deep swamps, far apart. One is in\r\n    southern Missouri, New Madrid country, another near Varney,\r\n    Arkansas, and a third, in a vast morass on the Apalachicola river,\r\n    Florida. It is believed to have been originally a Florida species,\r\n    and by some freak of nature it reached the Missouri and Arkansas\r\n    swamps. Certain other Florida plants accompanied it, one of which\r\n    was corkwood (_Leitneria floridana_). It is expected that pumpkin\r\n    ash will be found elsewhere in deep swamps intermediate between the\r\n    extremes of its range. The uses of this wood are few, because it is\r\n    scarce, and the trees are difficult of access on account of being\r\n    nearly always surrounded by water. Lumbermen who operate in swamps\r\n    occasionally bring out a few ash logs with cypress and tupelo. No\r\n    tests seem to have been made of the wood. Trees are sometimes 120\r\n    feet high and three in diameter above the swelled bases.\r\n\r\n    WATER ASH (_Fraxinus caroliniana_) is much lighter in weight than\r\n    any other American ash, and the wood is also lighter in color. It is\r\n    weaker and less elastic than any other, and is lower in fuel value.\r\n    It weighs less than white pine. It grows in deep swamps from\r\n    southern Virginia to Florida and westward in swamps to Texas. Some\r\n    have confused it with pumpkin ash, but the two are quite distinct.\r\n    This tree is also called poppy ash. The leaves are from seven to\r\n    twelve inches long, with five or seven leaflets which are much\r\n    blunter than most other ash leaves. The seeds are nearly in the\r\n    center of the broad, long wing, and are better flyers than most ash\r\n    seeds. The tree seldom exceeds forty feet in height, or twelve\r\n    inches in diameter. It is not known that the wood is ever used. Its\r\n    scarcity will keep it from becoming important, though its uncommon\r\n    lightness may lead to its employment for certain purposes.\r\n\r\n    BILTMORE ASH (_Fraxinus biltmoreana_) is named from Biltmore, N. C.,\r\n    where the tree attains its best development, a height of forty or\r\n    fifty feet and a foot or less in diameter. Its range extends from\r\n    northern West Virginia southward along the foothills of the\r\n    Appalachian mountains to Georgia, Alabama, and middle Tennessee. The\r\n    seed wings are slender, and only slightly narrowed at the end. The\r\n    leaf is ten or twelve inches long, with seven or nine leaflets. The\r\n    twigs of young trees are hairy. An occasional log doubtless goes to\r\n    sawmills, but no report has been made of uses of the wood.\r\n\r\n    FLORIDA ASH (_Fraxinus floridana_) is a deep swamp tree, thirty or\r\n    forty feet high, and a few inches in diameter. It is found in the\r\n    valley of St. Mary’s river, southern Georgia, and along the lower\r\n    Apalachicola river, Florida. The compound leaves are five or more\r\n    inches long with three or five leaflets. The seeds are small but\r\n    their wings are wide and long. No report has been made concerning\r\n    the quality of the wood, nor has it been used, as far as known. The\r\n    supply is very small.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUGAR MAPLE\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SUGAR MAPLE]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUGAR MAPLE\r\n\r\n(_Acer Saccharum_)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe makers of sugar in the North call this tree sugar maple, but\r\nlumbermen and users of wood nearly always speak of it as hard maple. All\r\nmaples--and there are nearly a dozen--are tolerably hard, and sugar may\r\nbe obtained from most of them; but this species is hardest of all, and\r\nthe most prolific sugar maker, hence the two names are appropriate. It\r\nis often called rock maple, which name refers to its hard wood. In some\r\nregions the name most heard is sugar tree.\r\n\r\nIts range extends from Newfoundland through Canada to Lake of the Woods,\r\nsouthward through Minnesota, Iowa, Kansas, and Arkansas to Texas. It is\r\nfound in every state east of the Mississippi, but it is not abundant in\r\nthe South. Its best development is found from New England across the\r\nnorthern states to Michigan. Some very fine sugar maple is found in\r\nfertile valleys and on slopes among the Appalachian ranges from\r\nPennsylvania southward. The largest lumber cut of maple is in the\r\nfollowing states, ranging in the order given: Michigan, Wisconsin,\r\nPennsylvania, West Virginia, New York, Ohio, Indiana, and Vermont. Since\r\nthe different species of maple are not reported separately in\r\nstatistics, there is no way of determining how much each of the maples\r\nsupplies. It is well known that sugar maple greatly exceeds all others.\r\n\r\nAt its best this tree may exceed a height of 100 feet and a diameter of\r\nthree; but the average for mature timber in the best part of its range\r\nis sixty or eighty feet in height, and two in diameter. The flowers\r\nappear with the leaves in early spring, but the seeds do not ripen until\r\nautumn, when they are bright red. They are winged, and usually two grow\r\ntogether, but they sometimes become detached, in which case each is\r\ncapable of flight with its single wing. It is characteristic of maple\r\nseeds to whirl rapidly while falling, and if a moderate wind is blowing,\r\nthey glide considerable distances. They usually fly farther than the\r\nseeds of ash although their wings are no larger. The immense numbers of\r\nseeds borne by the sugar maple insure abundant reproduction in the\r\nvicinity of parent trees. The seeds sprout readily, but often so closely\r\ncrowded together that most of them die the first few weeks. Not one in\r\nten thousand can even become a large tree, and yet large trees are\r\nexceedingly abundant in extensive regions. They often form nearly pure\r\nstands, crowding to death all rivals that try to obtain a foothold. On\r\nthe other hand, this maple often contents itself with a place among\r\nother forest trees.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the most vigorous and dependable of trees. It does not grow\r\nfast, but it keeps steadily at it a long time, and enjoys unusually good\r\nhealth. Its worst enemy is coal smoke, but fortunately, most sugar maple\r\nforests are out of reach of that disturber, though shade trees near\r\nfactory towns and in the vicinity of coke ovens often suffer. Woodlots\r\nof sugar maple, occupying corners of farms in the northern states from\r\nMinnesota to Maine, present pictures of health, vigor, cleanliness, and\r\nbeauty which no forest tree surpasses. The intense green and the density\r\nof the crowns in summer make the trees conspicuous in any landscape\r\nwhere they occur, while their brilliant colors in autumn are the chief\r\nglory of the forest where they abound.\r\n\r\nThe wood of this tree is hard, strong, and dense. It is three pounds\r\nlighter per cubic foot than white oak, and theoretically it rates a\r\nlittle lower in fuel value, but those who use both woods as fuel\r\nconsider maple worth more. It is thirty per cent stronger than white\r\noak, and fifty-three per cent stiffer. The wood is diffuse-porous, that\r\nis, the pores are not arranged in bands or rows, as they usually are in\r\noaks, but are scattered in all parts. They are too small to be seen with\r\nthe naked eye, but under a magnifying glass they are visible in large\r\nnumbers. The yearly ring is not very distinct, because of the slight\r\ncontrast between spring and summerwood. The medullary rays are numerous\r\nbut small. In wood sawed along radial lines, from heart to sap, small\r\nsilvery flecks are numerous. These are the medullary rays. They add\r\nsomething to the appearance of quarter-sawed maple, but not enough to\r\ninduce mills to turn out much of it.\r\n\r\nSuch figures as maple has are brought out best in tangential\r\nsawing--that is, cut like a slab off the side of the log. Three distinct\r\nfigures are recognized in sugar maple, and to some extent they belong to\r\nother maples. These forms of wood are known as birdseye, curly, and\r\nblister maple. They are accidental forms and exist in certain trees\r\nonly. Students of wood structure are not wholly agreed as to the cause\r\nof these forms, but one of them, the birdseye effect, is believed to be\r\ndue to adventitious buds which distort the wood in their vicinity. These\r\nbuds start near the center of the tree when it is small, but never\r\nsucceed in forcing their way out. They remain just beneath the bark\r\nduring most or the whole of the tree’s life. A pin-like core, resembling\r\na fine thread, connects the birdseye with the tree’s pith. This thread\r\nis the pith of the embryonic branch formed by the bud which never breaks\r\nthrough the bark. When the wood is sawed tangentially, small, dark-brown\r\npoints or dots show the center of the buds, or the pith line connecting\r\nit with the tree’s center. Curly maple and blister maple are not\r\nbelieved to be formed in the same way as birdseye.\r\n\r\nThe uses of sugar maple are nearly universal, where a hard, white wood\r\nis wanted. Many large trees contain little colored heart, and trees are\r\ngenerally fifty years old before they have any. More maple is worked\r\ninto flooring than into any other one commodity. Mills in Michigan\r\nalone, in 1910, made 185,611,662 feet of maple flooring. It was shipped\r\nto practically every civilized country in the world. Many builders\r\nconsider it the best wooden floor that can be laid. In a test made in a\r\nlarge store in Philadelphia some years ago, a marble floor wore through\r\nsooner than maple, when the same wear was on both.\r\n\r\nNearly all kinds and classes of furniture have places for maple, either\r\nas outside material or inside frames, drawer bottoms, or partitions.\r\nVehicle manufacturers employ it for heavy axles, running gear, parts of\r\nautomobiles, sleigh runners and frames, and hand sleds. It is made into\r\nhandles from gimlet sizes to cant hooks. Gymnasium apparatus owes much\r\nto the whiteness, smoothness, and strength of maple. Woodenware from\r\ntoothpicks to ironing boards; from butcher blocks to butter molds; from\r\ndoor knobs to die blocks, is dependent on maple for some of its best\r\nmaterial. It is largely used for boxes, in both solid and veneer form.\r\nOnly two woods are now employed in larger amounts for veneers in the\r\nUnited States than maple. They are red gum and yellow pine.\r\n\r\nMaple is one of the three woods most largely employed in hardwood\r\ndistillation in this country; beech and birch are the others. Maple\r\nsugar is a product of this tree almost exclusively, and the business is\r\nlarge. In some parts of New England it is claimed that a grove is worth\r\nmore for sugar than the land is worth for agriculture.\r\n\r\n    SILVER MAPLE (_Acer saccharinum_) is generally called soft maple by\r\n    lumbermen. It is known also as white maple, river maple,\r\n    silver-leaved maple, swamp maple, and water maple. The sinuses of\r\n    the leaves are very deep. The lighter color of its bark and the pale\r\n    green of the leaves distinguish soft maple at a glance from sugar\r\n    maple when both are in full leaf. The greenish-yellow flowers open\r\n    in early spring, and the seeds are ripe in April or May, depending\r\n    on the season and region. The seeds have large wings and fly well.\r\n    They germinate in a few days after they find suitable soil, and\r\n    before the end of the summer the seedlings have grown several\r\n    leaves. The vigor thus displayed continues until the tree is large.\r\n    It is a fast grower, and for that reason has been extensively\r\n    planted as a street and park tree. The wisdom of doing so is\r\n    doubtful, for this maple throws out long limbs which are often\r\n    broken by wind. The trunk is subject to disease, and a row of old\r\n    soft maples nearly always presents a ragged, unkempt, neglected\r\n    appearance. As to beauty of form and crown, there is little\r\n    comparison between it and the planted sugar maple. Soft maples in\r\n    forests range from seventy-five to 120 feet in height, and two to\r\n    four in diameter; that is, they attain about the same size as sugar\r\n    maples. The species covers a million square miles, practically the\r\n    whole country east of the Mississippi, some west of that river, and\r\n    most of eastern Canada.\r\n\r\n    It is a useful wood for many purposes. The custom of mixing this\r\n    with sugar maple makes it impossible to clearly separate the two\r\n    woods afterwards. It is the opinion of some well-informed\r\n    manufacturers that about five per cent of the total maple cut in the\r\n    United States is soft maple. The ratio is less in the North and more\r\n    in the South. The wood is hard, strong, rather brittle, easily\r\n    worked, pale brown with thick, white sapwood. Some rather large\r\n    trunks have no sapwood. It is in general use, but not for as many\r\n    purposes as sugar maple. The largest places found for it are as\r\n    flooring and woodenware, though furniture and boxes, particularly\r\n    veneer boxes, consume much. Its weight is three-fourths that of\r\n    sugar maple. The largest trees and the best wood grow in the lower\r\n    Ohio valley.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRED MAPLE\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RED MAPLE]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRED MAPLE\r\n\r\n(_Acer Rubrum_)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis tree’s names describe it. Some refer to color of leaves, flowers,\r\nand fruit, others to situation where it grows best. It is known as red\r\nmaple and swamp maple; also as water maple, white maple, scarlet maple,\r\nand shoepeg maple. New York Indians called it ah-we-hot-kwah, which\r\nmeant red flower. Most trees looked alike to Indians, and when they gave\r\na name, it was descriptive.\r\n\r\nThe redness of this maple is so marked that it cannot escape notice. The\r\nflowers, fruit, twigs, and leaves all possess the property at one time\r\nor another during the season. The flower comes before the leaf, during\r\nthe first warm days of spring. That is pretty early in the South, and\r\nlater in the North. The flowers are bright scarlet, and very\r\nconspicuous, growing in umbel-like, drooping clusters. The staminate and\r\npistillate ones frequently grow on different trees, and always in\r\nseparate clusters.\r\n\r\nThe fruit ripens quickly, and is sometimes almost mature before the\r\nleaves appear. The date of ripening depends upon latitude. The tree’s\r\nrange north and south exceeds a thousand miles and that makes much\r\ndifference in climate. In the South the fruit outstrips the leaves and\r\nhas about reached maturity before the unfolding leaves are large enough\r\nto hide it; but in New England and New York the leaves are large before\r\nthe fruit is mature. The seed is the characteristic maple key, with a\r\nwing to carry it. The fruit--and by that term the seed with its attached\r\nwing is meant--is bright red, and a tree loaded with the vivid clusters\r\nis a beautiful spectacle. Two seeds are generally fast together, and\r\nthey make surprising flights in that condition, passing with whirling\r\nmotion through the air. Gravity spins them, but wind carries them\r\nforward, and the random of their flight depends on the strength of the\r\nwind, which happens to be blowing when they sever their connection with\r\nthe tree.\r\n\r\nThe seeds germinate quickly when they light on damp soil. If they do not\r\nfind such situations, they soon perish; because they do not retain their\r\nvitality long. By the middle of summer the young trees have several\r\nleaves, and from that time on the struggle is mainly among themselves\r\nfor space and moisture, because they stand so thick that it is a\r\nsurvival of the fittest.\r\n\r\nThe young twigs are generally red in spring, but they do not present as\r\nconspicuous a mass as the flowers and fruit do. The leaves are simple,\r\nwith long reddish petioles. They have three or five lobes, the lower\r\npair often entirely missing, and small if present. Each lobe has a\r\npointed apex, and is irregularly serrate. The base of the leaf is\r\nrounded; also the sinuses, which extend far into the body of the leaf.\r\nThe upper surface of the leaf is bright green, the lower a\r\nsilvery-white. In the fall this tree is entitled to the name scarlet;\r\nfor then the brilliant hues of the leaves are remarkably fine.\r\n\r\nThe range of red maple covers more than a million square miles, and\r\ntouches every state east of the Mississippi river, and west of that\r\nstream it extends from South Dakota to Texas. It prefers rather swampy\r\nground, but wants fertile soil. It is frequently found on the banks of\r\ncreeks and rivers, and rarely on hillsides. It is most abundant in the\r\nSouth, particularly in the lower Mississippi valley, while trees of\r\nlarger size are found in the valley of the lower Ohio. In the North it\r\ntakes more to low wet swamps where it sometimes grows in such thickets\r\nas almost to exclude other species.\r\n\r\nThe best red maple trees attain a height of 100 feet or more, and a\r\ndiameter of four feet or less. The average size is seventy feet high and\r\ntwo in diameter. The form of the tree, like that of all other maples,\r\ndepends much upon the situation in which it grows. Good saw timber is\r\nnot often cut from this species near the outer borders of its range.\r\n\r\nThe wood is about three-fourths as strong as hard maple, and is five\r\npounds lighter per cubic foot, but is about six pounds heavier than soft\r\nor silver maple. It may, therefore, be considered that in some important\r\npoints red maple is midway between hard and soft maple. In color it is\r\nlight brown, slightly tinged with red. The sapwood is thick and lighter\r\nin color than the heart. The tree is usually not of rapid growth. The\r\ncontrast between the springwood and summerwood is not strong. The wood\r\nis very porous, but the pores are so small that the unaided eye cannot\r\ndiscern them. The medullary rays are numerous, but thin, and are seldom\r\nconsidered in working the lumber.\r\n\r\nMills which saw this maple do not separate the lumber from other maples.\r\nThe woodsman knows the difference, but the lumberman does not consider\r\nit worth while to pile the sawed stock separately. It sometimes goes to\r\nmarket as hard maple, sometimes as soft, but never under its own name.\r\nConsequently, it has no uses which are not also common to other maples.\r\nLumbermen cut it when they find it mixed with other hardwoods where they\r\nare carrying on logging operations.\r\n\r\nRed maple is made into flooring, interior finish, and veneer box\r\nmaterial. Veneers are also made for furniture. These are the most\r\nimportant uses for the wood, but the manufacturers of woodenware employ\r\nit for numerous commodities, such as trays, bowls, ironing boards, grain\r\nscoops, snow shovels, clothes racks, garment hangers, and clothes pins.\r\nThis species shows birdseye effect similar to that of sugar maple, but\r\nless of the stock goes to market. Logs with birdseye wood are generally\r\nreduced to veneer by the rotary process. Curly and wavy grains also\r\noccur in this maple. The wavy grain was much sought after by the early\r\nhunters who equipped their long rifles with stocks. Having found a piece\r\nof timber with the desired wavy grain, the hunter proceeded to shave and\r\nwhittle until the stock was fitted to the barrel, and the gun was\r\ncomplete. Some of the stocks made with no tools but an ax, drawing\r\nknife, and a pocket knife, were works of art which are worthy of\r\npreservation in museums.\r\n\r\nOccasionally some unknown rural Stradivari made a violin and selected\r\nthe curly wood of red maple for the neck and sides. A few of these\r\ninstruments are floating about the country, but an age of fifty or a\r\nhundred years has not yet imparted classic value to them, but the wood\r\nis unsurpassed in delicacy of grain and figure.\r\n\r\nSugar may be manufactured from red maple, but in smaller quantity than\r\nfrom sugar maple. In the days when every frontier settlement did its own\r\nmanufacturing, inks and dyes were made from the bark of this tree. The\r\ntannin boiled from the bark was treated with sulphate of iron, and it\r\nbecame ink; when alum was added it became black dye; when the sulphate\r\nof iron was omitted, and alum alone was put in, a cinnamon-colored dye\r\nresulted.\r\n\r\nRed maple is one of the most desirable trees for planting in parks and\r\nby roadsides. Nurserymen complain that seedlings are more difficult to\r\nmanage than silver maples; nor do they grow as rapidly, but the trees\r\nare worth much more when once established. They have shorter and\r\nstronger branches than silver maple; are less liable to be attacked by\r\ndisease; are more handsome in every way; but they demand damper soil,\r\nand succeed poorly in any other. That drawback tends to restrict the\r\nartificial planting of this tree.\r\n\r\n    MOUNTAIN MAPLE (_Acer spicatum_) is known also as moose maple, low\r\n    maple, and water maple. It is a small tree at its best, seldom more\r\n    than twenty-five feet high and eight inches in diameter, while in\r\n    most parts of its range it is only a shrub. Its best growth is on\r\n    mountain slopes of eastern Tennessee and western North Carolina. It\r\n    likes moist, rich hillsides, and does not object to shade. The\r\n    flowers come late, but within a month or six weeks after the bloom\r\n    appears, the fruit is full grown, but it remains on the tree till\r\n    autumn. The tree’s bark is smooth and very thin. The absence of\r\n    stripes distinguishes this tree from striped maple, which has nearly\r\n    the same range. Mountain maple grows from Maine to Minnesota,\r\n    southward to Michigan, and along the mountains to Georgia. The wood\r\n    is light, soft, brown tinged with red. The small size of the trunk\r\n    forbids its conversion into ordinary lumber. The only commercial use\r\n    reported for it is in Pennsylvania where it is cut along with other\r\n    hardwoods for destructive distillation.\r\n\r\n    FLORIDA MAPLE (_Acer floridanum_) is a species according to some,\r\n    and according to others is a variety of the hard maple. Its range is\r\n    limited, and the available quantity of the wood is small. It is\r\n    found in the swamps of southern Georgia and western Florida, and\r\n    westward to Texas, Louisiana, and southern Arkansas. Near the\r\n    southwestern limits of its range in Texas and Mexico, it is often a\r\n    shrub; but in the best part of its range it becomes a tree fifty or\r\n    sixty feet high and two or three in diameter. The wood passes for\r\n    hard maple when sawed into lumber, but it is not often sent to\r\n    sawmills. The makers of bent wood rustic furniture in some of the\r\n    southern towns, particularly in Louisiana, have found the slender\r\n    branches of Florida maple well suited to that purpose.\r\n\r\n    DRUMMOND MAPLE (_Acer rubrum drummondii_) is a variety of red maple,\r\n    not a separate species. Its range lies in the coastal plain of\r\n    Alabama and Georgia, western Louisiana, eastern Texas, southwestern\r\n    Tennessee, and southern Arkansas. It grows in deep swamps, and has\r\n    three-lobed leaves, and large-winged fruit, ripening in April and\r\n    May. The wood is too scarce to be important in the lumber trade, but\r\n    where it can be had it is used. Violin makers have procured some\r\n    finely curled wood of this maple in Union Parish, Louisiana. Some of\r\n    the wood from that district has been made into gunstocks also.\r\n\r\n    WHITEBARK MAPLE (_Acer leucoderme_) has been classed as a variety of\r\n    sugar maple, and also as a separate species. It is named from the\r\n    light gray color of the bark of young stems; but the color turns\r\n    dark with age. The tree is usually twenty or thirty feet high with a\r\n    diameter of a foot or more. The wood is of good quality, but no\r\n    uses, except fuel, have been reported. Trees are not abundant, but\r\n    the range covers parts of North Carolina, Tennessee, Georgia,\r\n    Alabama, Louisiana, and Arkansas. It is occasionally planted as a\r\n    shade tree along the streets of towns of Georgia and Alabama.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOREGON MAPLE\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OREGON MAPLE]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOREGON MAPLE\r\n\r\n(_Acer Macrophyllum_)\r\n\r\n\r\nBotanists prefer to call this tree broadleaf maple. The name is not\r\ninappropriate, as its extraordinarily broad leaves constitute the most\r\nstriking feature of the tree where it stands in the woods. The leaf is\r\nusually wider than it is long. Some exceed a foot in both measurements.\r\nBigleaf maple is not an uncommon name for the tree in Oregon, where it\r\nattains its highest development in damp valleys where the soil is good.\r\nThe name white maple is not particularly descriptive of any feature of\r\nthe tree, though the name is applied in both Oregon and Washington. In\r\nCalifornia it is known simply as maple. There is small likelihood in\r\nthat region that it will be confused with any other member of the maple\r\nhousehold; nor is there much danger of such a thing in any part of the\r\nPacific coast, for, though four species of maple occur there, no one of\r\nthem bears close enough resemblance to this one to be mistaken for it.\r\n\r\nThe Oregon maple’s range north and south covers twenty degrees of\r\nlatitude. In that particular it is not much surpassed, if surpassed at\r\nall, by any maple of this country. Its northern limit lies in Alaska,\r\nits southern close to the Mexican boundary, in San Diego county,\r\nCalifornia. Its range east and west is restricted. It has a width of\r\nabout one hundred and fifty miles in California, where it grows from the\r\ncoast to the foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountains. An altitude of\r\n5,600 feet appears to be the limit of its range upward. It attains\r\naltitudes above 5,000 feet at several points in the Sierra Nevada range.\r\nIt descends nearly to sea level. Its geographical range is similar to\r\nthe ranges of several other Pacific coast species which occupy long\r\nribbons of territory stretching north and south parallel with the coast\r\nof the Pacific ocean.\r\n\r\nThis maple’s leaves change to a clear reddish-yellow before falling.\r\nFlowers appear after the leaves are grown, and the seeds ripen late in\r\nautumn. Some of them hang until late in winter, but the habit varies in\r\ndifferent parts of the range, as is natural in view of its great\r\nextension north and south. The trees which stand in open ground are very\r\nabundant seeders, but those in dense stands produce sparingly, in that\r\nparticular following the habit of most trees. This maple often grows in\r\ndense, nearly pure stands in Oregon and Washington where soil and other\r\nconditions are favorable.\r\n\r\nThe sizes and forms of Oregon maple vary greatly. John Muir spoke of\r\nforests whose trees were eighty or one hundred feet high, so dense with\r\nleaves and so abundantly supplied with branches that moss and ferns\r\nformed a canopy with foliage and limbs high over head, like an aerial\r\ngarden; while George B. Sudworth described it in certain situations as a\r\nshort-stemmed, crooked tree from twenty-five to thirty feet high and\r\nunder a foot in diameter.\r\n\r\nThis maple has been called the most valuable hardwood of the Pacific\r\ncoast, but that claim is made also for other trees. Some persons rate it\r\nwith the hard maple of the East, in properties which commend it for use.\r\nIt is doubtful if the claim can be substantiated. According to Sargent’s\r\nfigures for strength, stiffness, weight, and fuel value, it lacks much\r\nof equalling the eastern tree. It is twelve pounds per cubic foot\r\nlighter; has not three-fourths the fuel value; and is little more than\r\nhalf as strong or as stiff. The comparison is more in favor of the\r\nwestern tree when color of wood and appearance of grain are considered.\r\nThe wood is light brown with pale tint of red. The rings of annual\r\ngrowth are tolerably distinct, with a thin, dark line separating the\r\nsummerwood of one year from the springwood of the next. The pores are\r\nscattered with fair evenness in all parts of the ring. They are small\r\nand numerous. The medullary rays are thin and abundant. In quarter-sawed\r\nwood they show much the same as in hard maple, but are rather darker in\r\ncolor. The mirrors are decidedly tinged with brown. The wood is reported\r\npoor in resisting decay when in contact with the soil.\r\n\r\nThe largest use of Oregon maple appears to be for furniture, second, for\r\ninterior finish, and following these are numerous miscellaneous uses.\r\nStatistics of the cut of this wood, as shown by sawmill reports, are\r\nunsatisfactory. Census returns include it with all other maples of the\r\ncountry, without figures for species. The cut of maple for all the\r\nwestern states seems too small to give this wood justice. The amount\r\nreported used in Washington, Oregon, and California exceeds the total\r\nreported sawmill cut in the West.\r\n\r\nOregon maple is an important handlewood. The smooth grain appeals to\r\nbroom makers. The wood is made into ax handles, but for that use it is\r\nmuch below hickory, or even hard maple or white oak. It is converted\r\ninto pulleys in Washington, also into saddle trees, and tent toggles.\r\nBoat makers employ it for finish material, in which capacity it fills\r\nthe same place, and must meet the same requirements as in interior\r\nfinish for houses. Curly or wavy wood is occasionally found and this is\r\nworked into finish and also into furniture. The figure is as handsome as\r\nin eastern maple, but birdseye is less frequent. Counter tops for stores\r\nand bar tops for saloons are sometimes made of figured maple. It is seen\r\nalso in grill work and show cases, but in order to show the figured wood\r\nto the best advantage it should be worked in flat surfaces.\r\n\r\nOregon maple is converted into flooring of the ordinary tongued and\r\ngrooved kind, and also into parquet flooring. Rotary veneers are made\r\ninto boxes and baskets. Solid logs are turned for rollers of various\r\nsizes and kinds. Mill yards use them for offbearing lumber, and house\r\nmovers find them about the best local material to be had. This maple has\r\nbeen successfully stained in imitation of mahogany, and is said to pass\r\nsatisfactory tests where the color is the principal consideration.\r\n\r\nThe amount of this species available in the Northwest is not definitely\r\nknown, but it is a relatively scarce wood. No attention has ever been\r\ngiven to planting it as a commercial proposition. It is not of very\r\nrapid growth, and unless it is in dense stands, it develops a short\r\ntrunk and large crown. It is better suited for shade and ornament, and\r\nis to be seen as a street tree in some western towns. It does not\r\nflourish in the eastern states, but has found the climate of western\r\nEurope more congenial and is occasionally found as an ornamental tree\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nThe relative importance of this maple in the state of Washington is\r\nindicated by the amount used annually compared with certain other\r\nhardwoods. In 1911 the consumption of willow was 2,000 feet, vine maple\r\n10,000, Oregon ash 58,000, Oregon oak 197,000, western birch 315,000,\r\nOregon maple 932,500, red alder 1,881,500, and black cottonwood\r\n32,572,200.\r\n\r\nVINE MAPLE (_Acer circinatum_) is sometimes called mountain maple,\r\nthough the name is misleading. It may grow among mountains, but always\r\nnear streams. It is found at various altitudes from near sea level to\r\n5,000 feet above. It ranges from the coast region of British Columbia\r\nsouthward through Washington and Oregon to Mendocino county, California.\r\nThis tree is more useful than might be inferred from its name, or even\r\nfrom a study of it in its usual form. Only an occasional tree is good\r\nfor the wood user. A height of twenty feet and a diameter of six inches\r\nare above the average. It is called vine maple because of its habit of\r\nsprawling on the ground like a vine. The trunk lacks sufficient\r\nstiffness to hold it erect. It grows upward to a certain point, then\r\nleans over and the branches lie on the ground. Some of them take root\r\nand in course of time what was first a single stem becomes a thicket of\r\nbranches and stems. The winter snow often has much to do with bending\r\nthe trunk, which appears to have no power to get back to the\r\nperpendicular when once bowed down. The damp situation where this tree\r\nthrives best, induces a luxuriant growth of moss and mold which help to\r\nbury the branches that lie on the ground.\r\n\r\nThe tree prospers in deep shade. The young leaves are rose red, and in\r\nthe fall become yellow or scarlet. The fruit is the characteristic maple\r\nkey. The wing becomes rose-red before falling in autumn. Though this\r\ntree is more a curiosity than a lumberman’s asset, it is not without\r\nvalue. Handle makers use 10,000 feet of it a year in the state of\r\nWashington. It is shaved and turned for ax and shovel handles. It has\r\ntwo-thirds the strength and less than half the stiffness of eastern hard\r\nmaple. The tree grows slowly and the annual rings are very narrow and\r\nindistinct. Seventy or eighty years are required to produce a trunk five\r\ninches in diameter. The wood is hard, and checks badly in seasoning. The\r\nbark is very pale brown--suggesting the color of a potato sprout that\r\nhas grown in a dark cellar. The Indians liked the wood for fish net\r\nbows, though there appears to have been no very good reason why they\r\npreferred it to other woods of the region. Its most extensive use at\r\npresent is as fuel, but it is not particularly sought after. The tree’s\r\nfuture is not promising. Under domestication it does not take on its\r\nfantastic, moldy, moss-grown form, and its forest growth will never be\r\nencouraged by lumbermen.\r\n\r\nDWARF MAPLE (_Acer glabrum_) is one of the smallest of the maples, but\r\nin a north and south direction its range is equal to that of any other.\r\nIts southern limit is among the canyons of Arizona, and its northern on\r\nthe coast of Alaska within six or seven degrees of the Arctic circle. It\r\nextends to Nebraska, and is found east of the continental divide far\r\nnorth in British America. It reaches its largest size on Vancouver\r\nisland and on the Blue mountains in Oregon. It here is large enough to\r\nmake small sawlogs, but it is usually shrubby in other parts of its\r\nrange. It grows from sea level in Alaska to 9,000 feet altitude among\r\nthe Sierra Nevada mountains of California. Two forms of leaf occur. One\r\nis three-lobed; the other is a compound leaf, the lobes having formed\r\nseparate leaves. The bright upper surface of the leaf gives the species\r\nits botanical name. The seeds have large, wide wings. It cannot be\r\nascertained that the wood of this maple has ever been used for anything.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOX ELDER\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BOX ELDER]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOX ELDER\r\n\r\n(_Acer Negundo_)\r\n\r\n\r\nAttempts to ascertain the meaning of the word _negundo_ which botanists\r\napply to this species have not been crowned with entire success. It is\r\nknown to be a word in the Malayalam language of the Malabar coast of\r\nIndia, and is there applied to a tree, apparently referring to a\r\npeculiar form of leaf. The name was transferred to the box elder by\r\nMoench, and has been generally adopted by botanists, although at least\r\nseven other scientific names have been given the tree. It bears ten or\r\nmore English names in different regions. Among these names are\r\nash-leaved maple, known from Massachusetts to Montana and Texas;\r\ncut-leaved maple in Colorado; three-leaved maple in Pennsylvania; black\r\nash in Tennessee; stinking ash in South Carolina; sugar ash in Florida;\r\nwater ash in the Dakotas; and box elder wherever it grows.\r\n\r\nThe tree’s geographical range does not fall much short of 3,000,000\r\nsquare miles, and is equalled by few species of this country. It extends\r\nfrom New England across Canada to Alberta, thence to Arizona, and\r\nincludes practically all the United States east and south of those\r\nlines. It thrives in hot and cold climates, and high and low elevations;\r\nin regions of much rain, and in those with little. That fact has been\r\nturned to account by tree planters, particularly in the years when the\r\nwestern plains were being settled by homesteaders. The box elder was the\r\nchief tree on many a timber claim where the letter of the law rather\r\nthan the spirit was carried out. It afforded the earliest protection\r\nagainst scorching summer sun and the keen winds of winter about many a\r\nfrontiersman’s cabin on the plains. It was the earliest street tree in\r\nmany western towns. The people planted it because they knew it would\r\ngrow, and they were not so sure of a good many other trees. Green ash\r\nwas often its companion in pioneer plantings on the plains. Many towns\r\nwhich set box elders along the streets when they did not know of\r\nanything better, still have the trees, though they would willingly\r\nexchange them for something else. They are not ideal street and park\r\ntrees; do not produce shapely trunks and crowns; and drop leaves all\r\nsummer and seeds all winter. The tree is reputed to be short lived, yet\r\nsome of those planted a generation or two ago show no symptoms of\r\ndecline.\r\n\r\nThere is no good reason why this tree should be called an elder, or an\r\nash, except that its leaves are compound. If that is a reason, it might\r\nbe called a hickory or a walnut, since they bear compound leaves. It is\r\nclearly a maple. Its fruit shows it to be so, and Indians of the far\r\nNorthwest who had no other maple, formerly manufactured sugar from this\r\ntree, collecting the sap in wood or bark troughs and boiling it with hot\r\nstones.\r\n\r\nThe compound leaf does not necessarily take it out of the maple group.\r\nIt requires no great exercise of imagination to understand how a lobed\r\nleaf, by deepening the sinuses between the lobes, might become a\r\ncompound leaf in the process of evolution. There may be no visible\r\nevidence that the box elder’s leaf reached its present form by that\r\nprocess, but there is another maple which is at the present time\r\ndeveloping a compound leaf in that way, or seems to be doing so. It is\r\nthe dwarf maple (_Acer glabrum_) of the Northwest coast. Lobed leaves\r\nand compound leaves may occur on the same tree.\r\n\r\nThe seeds of box elder resemble those of other maples. They ripen in the\r\nfall, and are blown off by wind, few at a time, during several months.\r\nThe trees are from fifty to seventy feet high, and from one and a half\r\nto three feet in diameter. The trunk is apt to divide near the ground in\r\nseveral large branches, and is not of good form for sawlogs, being often\r\ncrooked as well as short. The small branches, particularly those less\r\nthan a year old, are usually nearly as green as the leaves. This fact\r\nmay assist in identifying the tree when the leaves are off. The bark\r\nbears more resemblance to ash and basswood than to maple.\r\n\r\nThe wood is lightest of the maples. It weighs less than twenty-seven\r\npounds to the cubic foot; has less than half the strength and about\r\nforty per cent of the stiffness of sugar maple; and is much inferior to\r\nit in most mechanical properties. It is equal, if not superior to most\r\nmaples in whiteness. The pores are small, numerous, and scattered\r\nthrough all parts of the growth ring, as is characteristic of maple\r\nwood. The tree grows rapidly. The summerwood is a thin, dark line,\r\nseparating one annual ring from another. The medullary rays are many and\r\nobscure, but when wood is sawed or split along a radial line, they are\r\neasily seen, and show the true maple luster.\r\n\r\nThe uses of box elder are similar to those of soft maple. The wood is\r\nseldom reported under its own name. In fact, an examination of\r\nwood-using reports of various states, shows that in only two states,\r\nMichigan and Texas, has box elder been listed separately. Its uses in\r\nthe former state were for boxes, crates, flooring, handles, woodenware,\r\nand interior finish, while in Texas it was made into furniture. The tree\r\nis of commercial size in at least thirty states, and is cut and marketed\r\nin all of them. Tests of the wood for pulp are said to be satisfactory,\r\nand it finds its way in rather large amounts to cooper shops where it is\r\nmade into slack barrels. It is cut as acid wood along with other maples,\r\nbeech, and birch, and is converted into charcoal and other products of\r\ndistillation.\r\n\r\nIt may be expected that box elder will exist in the United States as\r\nlong as any other forest tree remains. It is willing to be crowded off\r\ngood land into low places, which are almost swamps, and there it grows\r\nfree from disturbance; but if given the opportunity it will appropriate\r\nthe most fertile soil within reach of it; and by scattering seeds during\r\nfour or five months of the year, it manages to do much effective\r\nplanting.\r\n\r\n    CALIFORNIA BOX ELDER (_Acer negundo californicum_) is a variety of\r\n    box elder, and not a separate species. As the name implies, it is a\r\n    California tree, and it occurs in the valleys and among the Coast\r\n    Range mountains from the lower Sacramento valley to the western\r\n    slopes of the San Bernardino mountains. The tree is from twenty to\r\n    fifty feet high and from ten to thirty inches in diameter. The\r\n    leaves and young twigs are hairy, in that respect differing from the\r\n    eastern box elder. The seeds are scattered during winter. The wood\r\n    is very pale lemon-yellow or creamy-white, the heart and sapwood\r\n    hardly distinguishable. The wood is soft and brittle, but is suited\r\n    to the same purposes as the eastern box elder. No reports of its\r\n    uses appear to have been made. It is found on the borders of streams\r\n    and in the bottoms of moist canyons. It is believed to be a\r\n    short-lived tree.\r\n\r\n    STRIPED MAPLE (_Acer pennsylvanicum_) is usually thirty or forty\r\n    feet high, and eight or ten inches in diameter. Its range extends\r\n    from Quebec to northern Georgia, westward to Minnesota, and is of\r\n    largest size on the slopes of Big Smoky mountains of Tennessee, and\r\n    the Blue Ridge in North and South Carolina. It grows best in shade,\r\n    but maintains itself in open ground; is generally shrubby in the\r\n    northern part of its range. The name refers to the bark. The stripes\r\n    are longitudinal and are caused by the parting of the outer bark and\r\n    the exposure to view of the lighter colored inner layers. The bark\r\n    of small trees is greenish, but later in life the color is darker,\r\n    and the stripes largely disappear. Among its names are moosewood, so\r\n    called because it is good browse for moose and other deer; goosefoot\r\n    maple, a reference to the form of the leaf; whistlewood, an allusion\r\n    to the ease with which the bark slips from young branches in spring\r\n    when boys with jack-knives are on the search for whistle material.\r\n    The names mountain alder and striped dogwood are based on\r\n    misunderstanding of the tree’s family relations.\r\n\r\n    The young leaves are rose colored when they unfold, and when full\r\n    grown are six inches wide. The wood is light and soft, and light\r\n    brown in color, the thick sapwood lighter. The wood is liable to\r\n    contain small brown pith flecks, which in longitudinal sections\r\n    appear as brown streaks an inch or less in length and as thick as a\r\n    pin, and in cross section they are brown dots. They are not natural\r\n    to the wood but are caused by the larvæ of certain moths which\r\n    burrow into the cambium layer, or soft inner bark, and excavate\r\n    narrow galleries up and down the trunk. The galleries afterwards\r\n    fill with dark material. The insects sometimes attack other maples,\r\n    the birches, service, and other trees. The wood of striped maple is\r\n    little used, because of the small size of the trees. The species is\r\n    planted for ornament in this country and Europe.\r\n\r\n    BLACK MAPLE (_Acer nigrum_) has been by some considered a variety of\r\n    sugar or hard maple, and by others a separate species. It is as\r\n    large as the sugar maple and its range is much the same, but it is\r\n    more abundant in the western part of its range than in the East. The\r\n    name refers to the color of the bark of old trunks. If the name had\r\n    considered the bark of young twigs it would have been yellow or\r\n    orange maple, because the twigs are of that color. In summer the\r\n    peculiar drooping posture of the leaves calls attention to this\r\n    tree. However, the bark, twigs, and leaves combined are not\r\n    sufficient to set it apart, in the eyes of most people, for it\r\n    generally passes without question as sugar maple, even when it\r\n    stands side by side with that tree. It yields sugar abundantly. The\r\n    wood is a little heavier than that of sugar maple, but the\r\n    difference cannot be noticed except when the two woods are weighed.\r\n    Their uses are the same. No maker of furniture, flooring, or finish\r\n    ever protests against black maple. The tree generally prefers lower\r\n    and damper ground than sugar maple, and is often found along\r\n    streams.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSERVICEBERRY\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SERVICEBERRY]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSERVICEBERRY\r\n\r\n(_Amelanchier Canadensis_)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis tree will never be other than a minor species in the United States,\r\nbut it is not a worthless member of the forest. It belongs to the rose\r\nfamily, and therefore is near akin to the haws, thorns, and crabapples.\r\nThe genus is found in Europe, Asia, and Africa, as well as in the United\r\nStates. Two tree species occur in this country, or, according to some\r\nbotanists, three, one west of the Rocky Mountains, two east.\r\n\r\nThe serviceberry has a number of names: June berry, service-tree, May\r\ncherry, Indian cherry, wild Indian pear, currant tree, shadberry,\r\nsavice, and sarvice. The northern limit of its range is in Newfoundland,\r\nthe southern in Florida. It grows westward to Minnesota and Arkansas;\r\nbut it is not plentiful except in certain restricted localities. It is\r\nmost abundant among the ranges of the Appalachian mountains, and of its\r\nlargest size toward the south. It is dispersed through forests\r\ngenerally, a tree or bush here and there; but it prefers the borders of\r\nforests, the brinks of cliffs, banks of streams, or some other open\r\nspace where light is abundant. It prospers most in rich soil but does\r\nfairly well in ground thin and dry.\r\n\r\nThe bloom, where it occurs, is a conspicuous feature of the landscape,\r\nthough generally a tree on ten or twenty acres represents the density of\r\nits stand. The white, showy bloom comes early in spring, when most trees\r\nare yet bare of leaves. Occasionally, however, the serviceberry is more\r\nabundant, and the rows and clumps of blooming trees along creek banks or\r\nabout the margins of glades or other openings in the forests, look like\r\ndistant snowdrifts.\r\n\r\nThe fruit is a berry a half inch or less in diameter, bright red when\r\nfully grown in early summer, and changing to purple when ripe. The seeds\r\nare brown and very small, and each berry contains from five to ten. When\r\ncircumstances are favorable, the tree is a prolific bearer, the slender\r\nbranches bending beneath the weight. The tree need not reach any\r\nparticular size before beginning to bear. On some of the severely burned\r\nsummits of the Alleghany mountains in West Virginia, 4,000 feet or more\r\nabove sea level, this tree, when only two or three feet high, bears\r\nabundantly. Such trees are probably sprouts from roots of older trunks\r\ndestroyed by fire. At its best, it reaches a height of forty or fifty\r\nfeet and a diameter of one or possibly two feet. Trunks of largest size\r\noccur among the southern Appalachian ranges.\r\n\r\nThe wood is heavy and very hard and strong. It is liable to check and\r\nwarp in seasoning, is satiny, and is susceptible of a good polish.\r\nMedullary rays are very numerous, but obscure; color, dark brown, often\r\ntinged with red. The wood is stronger, stiffer and heavier than white\r\noak. It possesses most of the properties to make it a wood of great\r\nvalue, but its scarcity, and the usual small size of the trees, relegate\r\nit to the class of minor woods. Some use is made of it in turnery and\r\nfor other small articles. It is frequently planted in gardens for its\r\nbloom and berries. In such situations it lacks some of the charm which\r\nit holds as part and parcel of the wildwoods where its early spring\r\nbloom is thrown against a background of leafless branches.\r\n\r\nWESTERN SERVICEBERRY (_Amelanchier alnifolia_) is also called\r\npigeonberry and sarvice. Its botanical name refers to the resemblance of\r\nits leaves to those of alder. Its range covers a million square miles,\r\nand the species reaches its best development on islands and rich bottom\r\nlands of the lower Columbia river. It is found as far south as\r\nCalifornia, north to Yukon territory, east to Lake Superior and northern\r\nMichigan. It is nowhere a tree of attractive size, and is usually a\r\nshrub about ten feet tall and one inch thick. Trees are sometimes thirty\r\nfeet high and six or eight inches in diameter. The fruit is blue-black\r\nand sweet, and pleasant to the taste if not overripe. Indians in the\r\nnorthern and western range of this tree gather the berries industriously\r\nwhile they last, and many of the white settlers do likewise. The birds\r\nflock to the thickets for their share, and though the berries are small,\r\nthe bears in the region consider them worthy of prompt and continued\r\nattention. The berries are generally a little more than half an inch in\r\ndiameter, and ripen in July or August, depending on latitude. Cattle,\r\nsheep, goats, and deer find this small tree or bush a source of food.\r\nThey do not object to eating the berries when obtainable, but their\r\nprincipal attack is on the leaves and tender shoots which afford\r\nexcellent browse. Fortunately, the serviceberry is so tenacious of life\r\nthat it is next to impossible to browse it to death. If eaten down to\r\nthe ground, with little left but bare and barked trunks sticking up like\r\nbean poles, the roots will throw up sprouts year after year, making the\r\nservice thicket a permanent browse-pasture. Fire is not able to destroy\r\nsuch a thicket, for, when the tops are burned off, the sprouts will\r\nquickly spring up with vigor unimpaired. As a source of food for\r\ninsects, birds, beasts, and men, few trees, in proportion to size and\r\nquantity, are the equal of western serviceberry. Flowers, fruit, leaves\r\nand sprouts are all food for something.\r\n\r\nLONGLEAF SERVICE TREE (_Amelanchier obovalis_) is by some regarded a\r\nvariety rather than a species. It occupies in part the same range as\r\nserviceberry, but runs much farther north, reaching the valley of\r\nMackenzie river in latitude 65. It is found in North Carolina and\r\nAlabama, but it is only a shrub in the extreme southern part of its\r\nrange. The fruit ripens in early summer and is reddish purple. Trees are\r\nseldom more than thirty feet high and eight inches in diameter. A\r\nvariety with large fruit is occasionally planted as an ornamental tree.\r\nUnless the crop of serviceberries is unusually plentiful in a locality,\r\nthe most of it is eaten by birds which temporarily abandon nearly all\r\nother sources of food and give their undivided attention to the\r\nperishable harvest which must be garnered in at once or it will be lost.\r\n\r\nNARROWLEAF CRAB (_Malus angustifolia_) is one of the wild crabapples of\r\nthe United States. They are of the genus _Malus_ and the thousands of\r\nvarieties of cultivated apples are derived from them, or from other\r\nspecies found in the old world which are very similar. They belong to\r\nthe rose family. The narrowleaf crab is found from Pennsylvania to\r\nFlorida and westward to Tennessee and Louisiana. It thrives best in open\r\nspaces in the forest and is often found in glades and along the banks of\r\nstreams in the North, while in the South it occurs in depressions in the\r\npine barrens. The flowers are much like those of apple, very fragrant,\r\nand in color are white, pink, or rose. When in full bloom, the tree is a\r\nbeautiful object, and its odor is carried long distances. The fruit is\r\nan apple in all respects except size and taste. It is somewhat\r\nflattened, and is an inch or less across. It is fragrant when fully\r\nripe, and many a person has been led by appearances to taste, only to\r\nmeet disappointment. The flesh is hard and sour, and unfit for food in\r\nits natural state, but by cooking and artificial sweetening, it is made\r\ninto preserves. The tree reaches a height of twenty or thirty feet and a\r\ndiameter of eight or ten inches. It is smaller than the sweet crab. The\r\nwood is hard, heavy, light brown, tinged with red, with thick yellow\r\nsapwood. It is not put to many uses, but is occasionally made into small\r\nhandles, and levers. It has been much used as stock on which to graft\r\napples. Farmers who wanted orchards formerly dug up small crabapples in\r\nthe surrounding woods and fields, planted them in an orchard, and when\r\nsecurely rooted, the apples of desired kinds were grafted on. If\r\nsuccessful, the apple finally replaced the crab by spreading its own\r\nbark and wood over the entire trunk, until no part of the original stock\r\nremained visible. The sweet crab was also employed as a stock on which\r\nto graft apples.\r\n\r\nSWEET CRAB (_Malus coronaria_) is the wild crab of the northeastern\r\nstates, although it intrudes on the region to the southwest to a limited\r\nextent. It finds use in ornamental planting in the region of best\r\ngrowth. It is known as American crab, sweet scented crab, crab apple,\r\nwild crab, crab, American crab apple, and fragrant crab. Its range\r\nextends from the shores of Lake Erie in Canada, south through New York\r\nand Pennsylvania, along the Alleghany mountains to Alabama; west to\r\nMinnesota, eastern Nebraska, Kansas, Louisiana, and eastern Texas. It\r\nneeds moist soil for good growth and the best types are found in the\r\nlower Ohio basin. In height this tree rarely exceeds thirty feet and it\r\nis bushy, having short rigid limbs. The leaves are rounded and sharply\r\ntoothed, the blossoms generally white and very fragrant; the fruit\r\nsmall, dry, yellow, tinged with red. The wood is heavy, not strong,\r\nheart light red, sapwood yellow. It is used for tool handles, small\r\nturned articles, and for carving and engraving.\r\n\r\nOREGON CRABAPPLE (_Malus rivularis_) grows wild from the Aleutian\r\nIslands, Alaska, southward to central California, and is of largest size\r\nin Washington and Oregon where trees are occasionally forty feet high\r\nand eighteen inches in diameter, but they are generally about ten feet\r\nhigh and form dense thickets. The fruit is oblong, ripens late in\r\nautumn, is greenish, or reddish, or clear lemon yellow in color, and\r\nrather pleasant to the taste. The tree grows slowly, the wood is hard,\r\nand light reddish-brown in color, and is suitable for tool handles.\r\n\r\nIOWA CRAB (_Malus ioensis_) grows from Minnesota to Texas and is the\r\ncommon crabapple of the Mississippi basin. Large trees are twenty-five\r\nfeet high and a foot in diameter. It is believed that this tree crosses\r\nwith the common apple, and produces a variety known as the soulard apple\r\n(_Malus soulardi_). Wild apple (_Malus malus_) is a European species\r\nintroduced into this country and now running wild.\r\n\r\n    MOUNTAIN ASH (_Pyrus americana_) is closely related to the crabs. It\r\n    occurs from Newfoundland to Manitoba, and southward along the\r\n    mountains to North Carolina. Trees have compound leaves, red berries\r\n    the size of small cherries, and reach a height of thirty feet and a\r\n    diameter of a foot or more. There are several forms or varieties,\r\n    among them the small fruit mountain ash (_Pyrus americana\r\n    microcarpa_) of the Alleghany mountains.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRED HAW\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RED HAW]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRED HAW\r\n\r\n(_Cratægus Coccinea_)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis tree belongs to the rose family, and the genus _Cratægus_ consists\r\nof a large group of small, thorny trees, scattered through many parts of\r\nthe world. They are known by their thorns, but comparatively few of them\r\nare known by name to the ordinary observer, and they afford a perpetual\r\nsource of study, victory, and bewilderment to the trained botanist. “No\r\nother group of American trees,” says Sudworth, “presents such almost\r\ninsurmountable difficulties in point of distinctive characters. It is\r\nimpossible, and fortunately unnecessary, for the practical forester to\r\nknow them all, and exceedingly difficult even for the specialist.” More\r\nthan one hundred species of these thorn trees occur in the United\r\nStates, exclusive of shrubs. Their bloom resembles that of apple and\r\npear trees. Bees and insects swarm round the flowering trees, assisting\r\nin cross fertilization. The various species are aggressive. They force\r\ntheir way into vacant spaces, and their thorns protect them against\r\nbrowsing animals. The wood is sappy and heavy, and for most of the\r\nspecies it is valueless. The growing brambles, however, perform an\r\nimportant service in forest economy. Seeds of various valuable trees are\r\nblown by wind or carried by birds and mammals into the thickets where\r\nthey germinate and get a start under the protecting shelter of the\r\nthorns. Finally the seedlings overtop the brambles, gain the mastery,\r\nshade the thorns to death, and develop valuable forests. The thorn trees\r\nshed their leaves annually. Their seeds are slow to germinate, some not\r\nsprouting until the second year. The fruit is worthless for human\r\nconsumption, but some of it has a tart and not unpleasant taste. It is\r\nof many colors and sizes, depending on species.\r\n\r\nNo attempt is here made to name or to list the species. Such a list\r\nwould, for most people, be a dull catalogue of names, and many of them\r\nin Latin because there are no English equivalents. A few representative\r\nspecies are given. The red haw, though not the most abundant, is widely\r\ndistributed, and is probably as well known as any. Its range extends\r\nfrom Newfoundland westward through southern Canada to the eastern base\r\nof the Rocky Mountains, thence south to Texas and Florida. It covers\r\none-half of the United States. In the northern part of its range the red\r\nhaw is confined to the slopes of low hills and along water courses, but\r\nsouth in the Appalachian mountains it grows at an elevation of several\r\nthousand feet.\r\n\r\nIt has various names in different regions. It is called scarlet haw,\r\nred haw, white thorn, scarlet thorn, scarlet-fruited thorn, red thorn,\r\nthorn, thorn bush, thorn apple, and hedge thorn. The fact is worthy of\r\nnote that it is well known and is clearly recognized in every region\r\nwhere it grows, though various names are given it.\r\n\r\nThe red haw never reaches large size. In rare cases it may attain a\r\nheight of thirty feet and a diameter of ten inches, but it is usually\r\nless than half that size. Where it grows in the open it develops a round\r\ncrown. The branches are armed with chestnut-brown thorns from an inch to\r\nan inch and a half in length. The bright scarlet color of the fruit\r\ngives name to the tree. It ripens late in September or in October, and\r\nat that time the tree presents a beautiful appearance. The branches\r\nfrequently remain laden with fruit after the leaves have fallen.\r\n\r\nThe wood of red haw is of a high character and but for its scarcity\r\nwould have wide commercial use. It is among the heavy woods of this\r\ncountry. A cubic foot of it, thoroughly seasoned, weighs 53.71 pounds.\r\nThe tree is of slow growth and therefore the annual rings are narrow,\r\nand the wood is dense. The evenness and uniformity of the rings of\r\nyearly growth make the wood susceptible of a high polish. The medullary\r\nrays are very obscure in red haw, and for that reason the appearance of\r\nthe wood is much the same, irrespective of the direction in which it is\r\ncut. In that respect it is similar to the wood of most members of the\r\nthorn family--usually being too small to be quarter-sawed. However, even\r\nif the trees were large enough, quarter-sawing would bring out little\r\nfigure.\r\n\r\nRed haw is a lathe wood. It is well suited to some other purposes, and\r\nhas been used for engraving blocks, small wedges, and rulers, but the\r\nbest results come from the lathe. If it is thoroughly seasoned it is not\r\nliable to crack or check, though cut thin in such articles as goblets\r\nand napkin rings. The turner sometimes objects to the wood because of\r\nits hardness and the rapidity with which it dulls tools. This drawback,\r\nhowever, is compensated for by the smoothness and fine polish which may\r\nbe given to the finished article. Red haw checker pieces have been\r\ncompared with ebony for wearing quality. In color the ebony is more\r\nhandsome, and on that account is generally preferred.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most extensive use of red haw is in the manufacture of\r\ncanes. Most of the species of thorn are suitable for that purpose on\r\naccount of their weight, strength, and hardness. Red haw is not\r\nspecially preferred, but is used with others. As a source of wood\r\nsupply, the tree will never be important, but as an adornment to the\r\nlandscape it will always be valuable, and at the same time will fill a\r\nminor place in the country’s list of commercial woods.\r\n\r\nSUMMER HAW (_Cratægus æstivalis_) is a southern species which\r\ncontributes more or less to the food supply of the people within its\r\nrange. It is known also as May haw and apple haw. The flowers appear in\r\nFebruary and March, are about one inch in diameter, and flushed with red\r\ntoward the apex. The fruit ripens in May, is bright red, very fragrant,\r\nand is from half to three-fourths of an inch in diameter. The flesh is\r\nof a pleasant taste, and is gathered in large quantities by country\r\npeople for making preserves and jelly. It is sold in town and city\r\nmarkets, particularly in New Orleans. The range of this thorn tree is\r\nfrom South Carolina and Florida, to Texas. It attains a height of twenty\r\nor thirty feet, and a diameter sometimes as great as eighteen inches. It\r\nreaches its largest size in Louisiana and Texas. It grows well on land\r\nwhich may be submerged several weeks in winter. The wood has not been\r\nreported for any use.\r\n\r\nCOCKSPUR (_Cratægus crus-galli_) may be taken as the type of more than\r\ntwenty species of cockspur thorns growing in this country. Its other\r\nnames are red haw, Newcastle thorn, thorn apple, thorn bush, pin thorn,\r\nhaw, and hawthorn. It grows southwestward from Canada to Texas, and\r\nextends into Florida. The largest trees are twenty-five feet high and a\r\nfoot in diameter. The fruit is dull red, half inch in diameter, ripens\r\nin September and October, and hangs on the branches until late winter.\r\nHogs eat the fruit when they can get it, and boys utilize the small\r\napples as bullets for elder pop guns. The thorns are formidable slender\r\nspines from three to eight inches long, strong, and extremely sharp.\r\nThey were formerly used as pins to close wool sacks in rural carding\r\nmills. The many species of cockspur thorns are multiplied by numerous\r\nvarieties. Fence posts and fuel are cut from the best trunks.\r\n\r\nPEAR HAW (_Cratægus tomentosa_) is a representative of at least ten\r\nspecies. It is called pear haw without any very satisfactory reason,\r\nsince the fruit bears little resemblance to pears. It is half an inch in\r\ndiameter, dull orange red in color, and sweet to the taste, but it is of\r\nlittle value as food. The tree has been occasionally planted for\r\nornament, but never for fruit. The flowers are showy. Trees at their\r\nbest are fifteen or twenty feet high and five or six inches in diameter.\r\nThey have few thorns and such as they have are small. The tree’s range\r\nextends from New York to Missouri, and along the Appalachian mountains\r\nto northern Georgia, and west to Texas and Arkansas. It is known in\r\ndifferent parts of its range as black thorn, red haw, pear thorn, white\r\nthorn, common thorn, hawthorn, thorn apple, and thorn plum.\r\n\r\nHOG HAW (_Cratægus brachyacantha_) is distinguished by its blue fruit.\r\nThe name indicates that the fruit is unfit for human food but is eaten\r\nby swine. In some parts of Louisiana the dense thickets produce\r\nconsiderable quantities of forage for hogs. The range is not extensive,\r\nbeing confined to Louisiana and eastern Texas where the tree occurs in\r\nlow, wet prairies. The largest specimens are forty or fifty feet high\r\nand eighteen inches in diameter. It is one of the largest of the thorns,\r\nand the best trunks are of size to make small, very short sawlogs, but\r\nit does not appear that the wood has ever been manufactured into\r\ncommodities of any kind. The tree is occasionally planted for ornament.\r\n\r\nBLACK HAW (_Cratægus douglasii_) reaches its best development on the\r\nPacific coast where trees occur thirty or more feet in height and a foot\r\nand a half in diameter. The principal range is west of the Rocky\r\nMountains, from British Columbia to northern California, but it extends\r\neastward to Wyoming, and the tree is found also in northern Michigan.\r\nThe fruit is black or very dark purple, is edible, and matures in early\r\nautumn, falling soon after. The heartwood is brownish-red. No use for\r\nthe wood has been found on the Pacific coast.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON HAW (_Cratægus cordata_), also known as Washington thorn,\r\nVirginia thorn, heart-leaved thorn, and red haw, grows on banks of\r\nstreams from the valley of the upper Potomac river southward through the\r\nAppalachian ranges to northern Georgia, and westward to Missouri and\r\nArkansas. Flowers are rose-colored, the fruit ripens in the fall and\r\nhangs till late winter. Trees are twenty or thirty feet high, and a foot\r\nor less in diameter. Washington haw is frequently planted in this\r\ncountry and in Europe.\r\n\r\nENGLISH HAWTHORN (_Cratægus oxyacantha_) was introduced into this\r\ncountry from Europe and has become naturalized in some of the eastern\r\nstates. Thirty or more varieties are distinguished in cultivation. It is\r\nworthy of note that, although the United States has more than 130\r\nspecies of thorn trees of its own, with varieties so numerous that no\r\none has yet named or counted all of them, a foreign thorn has been\r\nintroduced and added to the number.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAHOGANY\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAHOGANY]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAHOGANY\r\n\r\n(_Swietenia Mahagoni_)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis tree belongs to the family _Meliaceæ_ which has about forty genera,\r\nall of which are confined to the tropic except _Swietenia_ to which\r\nmahogany belongs. This tree has made its way up from southern latitudes\r\nand has secured a foothold in Florida where it is confined to the\r\nislands and the most southern part of the mainland.\r\n\r\nNo attempt is here made to settle or even to take part in the disputes\r\namong dendrologists as to what mahogany is. There are said to be more\r\nthan forty different trees which pass as mahogany in lumber markets.\r\nVarious descriptions and keys have been published for the purpose of\r\nseparating and identifying different woods which are bought and sold as\r\nmahogany. These woods grow on every continent except Europe; but those\r\nwhich pass as mahogany nearly all come from Africa or America. Some are\r\nwell known, both as to origin and botany, while others are doubtful.\r\nLogs sometimes appear in markets and no one knows where they come from,\r\nor the species which produce them. It has been maintained that annual\r\nrings will separate true mahogany from the false--that the true has no\r\nannual rings. At the best, this evidence is only negative and is worth\r\nlittle, since many tropical trees show no annual rings, and yet are no\r\nkin to mahogany. Neither is it certain that true mahogany shows no\r\nyearly rings. Some trees do not, but others may. The ring, as is well\r\nknown, is produced because the tree grows part of the year and rests\r\npart. In the tropics where growth is continuous, the ring may not exist,\r\nbut it sometimes does exist, and thus upsets the theory. Besides, it\r\nproves little in the case of mahogany which has a range extending from\r\nsouth of the equator northward into the temperate zone, where there are\r\nseasonal changes. It also grows near sea level and at considerable\r\naltitudes, and elevation alone might make considerable variation in the\r\ncharacter of the wood.\r\n\r\nThe two most important mahoganies of commerce--leaving botany out of the\r\nquestion--grow in Africa and in America. The most important of the\r\nAfrican mahoganies is _Khaya senegalensis_, and of the American is\r\n_Swietenia mahagoni_. It is the latter which extends its range into the\r\nUnited States, and it alone will be considered in these pages as true\r\nmahogany; the status of foreign woods which pass as mahogany will not be\r\ndiscussed.\r\n\r\nLeaves of the mahogany tree are three or four inches long, and an inch\r\nor more wide. They are compound, with from three to five pairs of\r\nleaflets. The tree is an evergreen and presents a fine appearance. The\r\nflowers appear in July and August, are small and cup-shaped. Fruit is\r\nfour or five inches long and two or more wide. It ripens in late fall or\r\nearly winter. The nearly square seeds are three-fourths of an inch long.\r\nIn Florida the tree rarely exceeds fifty feet in height and two in\r\ndiameter; but in tropical countries it may exceed a height of 100 and a\r\ndiameter of eight or ten. The bark is thin.\r\n\r\nThe wood is practically of the same weight as white oak, but is stronger\r\nand more elastic. It is exceedingly hard, very durable, and is\r\nsusceptible of high polish. Medullary rays are numerous but small and\r\nobscure. The color is rich reddish-brown, turning darker with age, but\r\nthe thin sapwood is yellow. It is known in Florida as mahogany, madeira,\r\nand redwood.\r\n\r\nThe uses of mahogany are so many and so well-known that it is\r\nunnecessary to speak of them in detail. There were importations into the\r\nUnited States nearly three hundred years ago, and it has been coming\r\never since. One thing about this wood deserves mention: the price has\r\nnot varied much in three hundred years. Different prices have prevailed,\r\nowing to distance from supply and differences in grade and quality; and\r\nthat holds true today; but for similar grades, the prices have been\r\nremarkable for their evenness.\r\n\r\nFlorida never figured largely in the world’s supply of mahogany. At\r\ntheir best, the trees were neither large nor numerous, but their quality\r\nwas good. Cutting of this timber ceased in Florida about three-quarters\r\nof a century ago. The islands and the small area of the mainland where\r\nthe timber grew, were stripped. The logs were shipped to the Bahama\r\nislands and it is said they found their ultimate market in England. A\r\nfew trees were overlooked here and there, and some that were small\r\nseventy-five years ago, have grown to merchantable size since. These\r\nhave been cut, a few at a time, and the cutting is still going on. The\r\ntotal is now only a few thousand feet a year, and one of the markets for\r\nthe logs, probably the chief market, is Miami, Florida. The logs are\r\nsmall, and are generally cut and brought in by negroes who find a tree\r\nnow and then, cut the logs, and float them as near to market as\r\npossible, and haul them the rest of the way. The scarcity of the trees\r\nmay be inferred from the fact that the average resident of south\r\nFlorida, where the range of the mahogany lies, never saw one. In\r\nappearance the tree when seen at a little distance, resembles a young,\r\nvigorous black walnut tree.\r\n\r\nCHINA TREE (_Melia azedarach_) belongs to the same family as mahogany\r\nbut is of a different genus. It is not native in the United States, but\r\nhas been extensively planted and is running wild. It is a forest tree in\r\nsome parts of Louisiana, but is found under pure forest conditions only\r\nhere and there. As such, the trunk and thin crown look like a forest\r\ngrown butternut tree in Wisconsin. It is abundant in yards and along\r\nstreets, where it is often called Chinaball tree. A little of the wood\r\nis used. The color resembles mahogany, but the texture is much coarser.\r\nAnnual rings are clearly marked by rows of large pores, and the wood\r\ndoes not polish well. It is sometimes known as pride of India, which\r\ncountry is its native home, or it was carried there from Persia at an\r\nearly date. A variety, commonly known as the Texas Umbrella tree (_Melia\r\nazedarach umbraculifera_), has been widely planted, and is known by its\r\nshort trunk and dense, round crown.\r\n\r\nSOAPBERRY (_Sapindus saponaria_), known also as false dogwood, is a\r\nspecies of south Florida, and is one of three soap trees in this\r\ncountry. It has no family kinship with mahogany, but the appearance of\r\nthe trees leads some persons to conclude that they are related to the\r\nChina tree. In fact, one of the species is locally known as wild China\r\nand Chinaberry. They are called soap trees because their fruit has a\r\nproperty which causes water to foam, and the natives of the West Indies\r\nonce used it for soap. The botanical name _Sapindus_ means “Indian\r\nsoap.” The tree is twenty-five or thirty feet high, and ten or twelve\r\ninches in diameter. The bloom appears in November in Florida, and the\r\nfruit ripens the following spring. The wood is heavy, rather hard, and\r\nis light brown, tinged with yellow. It reaches largest size on the\r\nThousand Islands, Florida. Another species is _Sapindus marginatus_\r\nwhich attains size similar to that of the first. It is found in southern\r\nFlorida, but is not abundant. It grows as far north as the mouth of the\r\nSt. John river. A third species is _Sapindus drummondi_ which has its\r\nrange from western Louisiana, Arkansas, and southern Kansas, through\r\nTexas, New Mexico, and Arizona, to Mexico. The flowers appear in May and\r\nJune, and the fruit ripens in September and October, but it hangs on the\r\ntrees until the following spring. When first ripe, it is half an inch in\r\ndiameter, and yellow, but when it dries it turns black. Trees attain\r\ndiameters up to two feet, and heights of forty or fifty. It is commonly\r\nsupposed to be the Chinaberry, by persons who judge by general\r\nappearances, but the two are not related. The wood’s appearance suggests\r\nthe heartwood of ash. It probably reaches its best development in Texas\r\nwhere it is manufactured into boxes, crates, and even furniture, but not\r\nin large amounts. It is reputed to be a rapid grower, and it may be\r\nunder the most favorable circumstances, but it is usually of rather slow\r\ngrowth. The wood splits readily into thin strips which are employed in\r\nmaking baskets for harvesting cotton. In western Texas it is made into\r\npack saddle frames.\r\n\r\n    MOUNTAIN MAHOGANY (_Cercocarpus ledifolius_) is not a mahogany, and\r\n    is not even in the same family. It belongs to the rose family, and\r\n    is closely related to the crabapple; but since it is commonly known\r\n    as mahogany, it is proper to mention it here. Extensive\r\n    consideration is unnecessary, for the tree is not important as a\r\n    source of wood. Three species are recognized by some botanists, four\r\n    by others. All are western, and are noted for their long-tailed\r\n    fruit. The generic name refers to that feature. The seed, with its\r\n    tail, is carried by the wind, or it catches in the wool of sheep and\r\n    the hair of cattle and goats, or the feathers of birds, and is\r\n    carried far and near. The mountain mahogany sometimes is thirty feet\r\n    high, and two in diameter. It grows from 5,000 to 9,000 feet\r\n    elevation, sometimes on steep cliffs. Its range extends from Wyoming\r\n    and Montana to Oregon, California, Arizona, and New Mexico. The wood\r\n    is bright, clear red, or rich dark brown. It reaches its largest\r\n    size on the mountains of central Nevada. Another species is known as\r\n    valley mahogany (_Cercocarpus parvifolius_). It ranges from Nebraska\r\n    to Oregon, and Texas to California. Its rate of growth is very slow,\r\n    and it seldom exceeds a height of thirty feet and a diameter of ten\r\n    inches. The wood is reddish-brown. A third species, called Trask\r\n    mahogany (_Cercocarpus traskiæ_) is chiefly notable on account of\r\n    its restricted range. It occurs as far as known, in a single canyon\r\n    of Santa Catalina island, off the southern coast of California. Some\r\n    of the specimens are twenty feet high and six inches in diameter. A\r\n    fourth species, or a variety, is known as short-flower mahogany\r\n    (_Cercocarpus parvifolius breviflorus_). It occurs in western Texas,\r\n    southern New Mexico and Arizona, usually at elevations about 5,000\r\n    feet above sea level where the largest trees are not more than eight\r\n    inches in diameter and twenty-five feet high.\r\n\r\n    VAUQUELINIA (_Vauquelinia californica_) belongs to the same family\r\n    as the so-called western mahoganies, that is, the rose family; but\r\n    it is of a different genus. Its range is largely south of the\r\n    international boundary, but it extends into southern Arizona where\r\n    the best development of the species occurs about 5,000 feet above\r\n    the sea on grassy slopes. It is seldom more than a bush, and the\r\n    wood is very heavy and hard, and is dark-brown, streaked with red.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBLACK WILLOW\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BLACK WILLOW]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBLACK WILLOW\r\n\r\n(_Salix Nigra_)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe willows and the cottonwoods belong to the same family of trees,\r\n_Salicaceæ_, and the family is fairly numerous, and it has some\r\nwell-defined traits of character. The quinine-bitter of the bark is ever\r\npresent, but more marked in willows than in cottonwoods. Though quite\r\nunpleasant to the taste, it is harmless. The leaves never grow in pairs,\r\nand in most instances they fall early in autumn, and some without\r\nchanging color. Male and female flowers are borne on different trees,\r\nand fertilizing is done by insects, often by honey bees and bumblebees.\r\nFruit ripens in late spring, and the seeds are equipped for flight by\r\nbeing provided with exceedingly fine silky hairs. The wind carries them\r\nlong distances. The trees generally grow in the immediate vicinity of\r\nstreams or in situations where the soil is damp, but there are\r\nexceptions.\r\n\r\nThe willow family consists of two genera, one the cottonwoods or\r\npoplars, the other the willows proper. There are about seventy-five\r\nspecies of willow in America, twenty of them trees. Some, however, are\r\nquite small and only occasionally attain sizes which place them in the\r\ntree class. The willows are old residents of this continent. They grew\r\nin the central portion of what is now the United States in the\r\nCretaceous age, as is proved by their leaf prints in the rocks. They\r\nhave held their ground ever since, and there is no likelihood that they\r\nare about to give it up. Few species are better fitted for holding what\r\nthey have. A few trees are capable of seeding a large region in a few\r\nyears, and if soil and situation are suitable, reproduction will be\r\nabundant. The willows’ tenacity of life is often remarkable. It\r\nsometimes seems next to impossible to kill them by cutting off their\r\ntops. There are said to be instances in Europe where willows have been\r\npollarded successively during hundreds of years, the crops of sprouts\r\nbeing used for wickerwork and other purposes. No such records exist in\r\nthis country, but the willow’s sprouting habit is well known. A shoot\r\nstuck in the ground will grow, and a fence post will sprout. Many\r\nwillows develop large stools, or roots, and repeatedly send up numerous\r\nsprouts, and it makes little difference how often they are cut, others\r\nwill come up.\r\n\r\nComparatively few willows that start in life ever become trees. They are\r\nsuppressed by crowding, or meet misfortunes of one kind or another which\r\nkeep them small, but occasionally a tree of good size results. Willow\r\ntrees are usually not old. Probably few reach an age exceeding 150\r\nyears. Large trunks, in old age, are apt to be hollow or otherwise\r\ndefective, though a willow tree will live many years after much of its\r\ntrunk has disappeared. A little green bark on the side, and sprouts from\r\nthe stump will maintain life long after all usefulness has ceased.\r\n\r\nYoung willows are usually pliant and tough, old are stiff and brash.\r\nThey range from sea level up to 10,000 feet or more; grow profusely in\r\nthe wet lands about the gulf of Mexico, and likewise on the bleak coasts\r\nof the Arctic ocean. Commander Peary found willows blooming in\r\nconsiderable profusion on the extreme northern shore of Greenland, where\r\nthey produce enough growth during the few weeks of summer sunshine to\r\nafford the muskox the means of eking out a living during his sojourn in\r\nthose inhospitable regions.\r\n\r\nThe identification of willows is one of the most difficult tasks that\r\nfall to the botanists. Black willow is unquestionably the most important\r\nwillow in this country from the lumberman’s standpoint. It is the common\r\ntree willow that attains size suitable for sawlogs. If a forest grown\r\nwillow of large size is encountered east of the Rocky Mountains in the\r\nUnited States, it is pretty safe to class it as black willow. There are\r\nsome others which grow large, but not many. Planted willows, both large\r\nand small, may be foreign species, and white willows, which are not\r\nnative in this country, but have been widely planted, and are running\r\nwild, may be occasionally found of ample size for saw timber.\r\n\r\nBlack willow’s range extends from New Brunswick to Florida, west to the\r\nDakotas, and south to Texas, thence passing into Mexico, New Mexico,\r\nArizona, and California. It attains its best size in the Ohio and\r\nMississippi valleys, though large trees are found in other parts of its\r\nrange. It is difficult to say what its average size is, for some black\r\nwillows are only a few feet high and an inch or two in diameter. The\r\nlargest trees exceed 100 feet in height and three in diameter. An\r\nextreme size of seven feet in diameter has been reported. It is not\r\nunusual to see willow logs three feet in diameter in mill yards in\r\nLouisiana, Mississippi, and Arkansas, and logs four feet in diameter are\r\nnot so unusual as to excite much comment. The average sizes, however, of\r\nwillow sawlogs in that region are from eighteen inches to two feet.\r\n\r\nThe wood of black willow is pale reddish-brown. When freshly cut it is\r\nsometimes purple, almost black. When sawed in lumber and exposed to the\r\nair the dark color fades. The wood is soft but firm. It has about fifty\r\nper cent of the strength of white oak, and forty per cent of its\r\nstiffness. It weighs 27.77 pounds per cubic foot; and considering its\r\nweight, it is tolerably strong and stiff.\r\n\r\nProbably no other wood in the United States is as systematically cheated\r\nout of its just credit as this one. Many of the oaks are seldom given\r\ntheir proper names, but they are listed as oak in sawmill output, and\r\nthus the genus, if not the species is given credit. But willow is almost\r\ntotally ignored. The United States census in 1910 credited to all the\r\nwillow lumber in this country an amount less than a million and a half\r\nfeet; yet a single mill in Louisiana, and not a large mill at that, cut\r\nand sold four times that much during that year. The wood was cut by\r\nhundreds of other mills, some a few logs only, others considerable\r\nquantities.\r\n\r\nIt is sold for various purposes, and much of it goes as cottonwood. In\r\nsome instances it is called brown cottonwood. Probably ninety per cent\r\nis made into boxes, but it has many other uses. It is cut into\r\nexcelsior, made into rotary cut veneer, and finds place in the\r\nmanufacture of furniture; it is a common woodenware material; slack\r\ncoopers make barrels of it; and it is turned for baseball bats.\r\n\r\nThe supply of black willow in this country is not small. It is usually\r\nfound in wet situations along streams. Sometimes islands and low flats\r\nare taken possession of and pure stands result. The growth is sometimes\r\nphenomenal. Trunks may add nearly or quite an inch to their diameter per\r\nyear when conditions are exceptionally favorable. Instances, apparently\r\nwell authenticated, are reported of abandoned fields along the\r\nMississippi, which in sixty years grew 100,000 feet of willow per acre.\r\n\r\n    LONGSTALK WILLOW (_Salix longipes_) sometimes grows to a height of\r\n    thirty feet with a diameter of six or eight inches. Its range\r\n    extends from Maryland to Texas, and is at its best in the Ozark\r\n    region of southwestern Missouri and northwestern Arkansas.\r\n\r\n    ALMONDLEAF WILLOW (_Salix amygdaloides_) grows across northern\r\n    United States and southern Canada from New York to Oregon, and\r\n    occurs as far south as Missouri and Ohio, and is abundant in the\r\n    lower Ohio valley. At its best it is seventy feet high and two feet\r\n    in diameter. The wood is light, soft, and the heartwood is brown.\r\n\r\n    SMOOTHLEAF WILLOW (_Salix lævigata_) attains a diameter of one foot\r\n    and a height of forty or fifty. It is a Pacific coast tree,\r\n    occurring in California on the western slopes of the Sierra Nevadas\r\n    up to an altitude of 3,000 feet. It is known as black willow. The\r\n    wood is pale reddish-brown.\r\n\r\n    SILVERLEAF WILLOW (_Salix sessilifolia_) looks like longleaf willow,\r\n    and though usually a shrub it sometimes is twenty-five feet high and\r\n    ten inches in diameter. It grows from the mouth of the Columbia\r\n    river to southern California.\r\n\r\n    YEWLEAF WILLOW (_Salix taxifolia_) ranges from western Texas,\r\n    through southern Arizona into Mexico and Central America. Trees are\r\n    occasionally forty feet high and more than one foot in diameter. A\r\n    little fuel and fence posts are cut from this willow.\r\n\r\n    BEBB WILLOW (_Salix bebbiana_) is nearly always shrubby, but\r\n    occasionally reaches a trunk diameter of six or eight inches and a\r\n    height of twenty feet. Its northern limit lies within the Arctic\r\n    circle, its southern in Pennsylvania, Nebraska, and Arizona. West of\r\n    Hudson bay it forms almost impenetrable thickets, and in Colorado it\r\n    ascends mountains to elevations of 10,000 feet.\r\n\r\n    GLAUCOUS WILLOW (_Salix discolor_), commonly known as silver or\r\n    pussy willow, ranges from Nova Scotia to Manitoba, and southward to\r\n    Delaware, West Virginia, Indiana, Illinois, and Missouri. It is one\r\n    of the best known willows within its range, on account of its\r\n    flowers which are among the earliest of the season, and very showy.\r\n    The largest specimens are scarcely twenty-five feet high and twelve\r\n    inches in diameter.\r\n\r\n    MACKENZIE WILLOW (_Salix cordata mackenzieana_) is not abundant, and\r\n    is one of the smallest of the tree willows. It is nearly always a\r\n    shrub. Its range extends from California nearly to the Arctic\r\n    circle, where it occurs in gravelly soil on the borders of mountain\r\n    streams.\r\n\r\n    MISSOURI WILLOW (_Salix missouriensis_) is so named because it\r\n    occurs principally in Missouri, but its range extends into Kansas\r\n    and Iowa. It is occasionally forty feet high and a foot in diameter.\r\n    It is used for fence posts.\r\n\r\n    BIGELOW WILLOW (_Salix lasiolepis_) is generally called white willow\r\n    on account of its gray bark. It occurs in California and Arizona,\r\n    and at its best it is twenty-five feet high and ten inches in\r\n    diameter. Some use is made of it as fuel, where other wood is\r\n    scarce.\r\n\r\n    NUTTALL WILLOW (_Salix nuttallii_), called also mountain willow in\r\n    Montana, ranges from British America, east of the Rocky Mountains,\r\n    to southern California. Its usual height is twenty or twenty-five\r\n    feet, and its diameter six or eight inches. In southern California\r\n    it grows 10,000 feet above sea level.\r\n\r\n    HOOKER WILLOW (_Salix hookeriana_) occurs in the coast region from\r\n    Vancouver island to southern Oregon, and varies in height from a\r\n    sprawling shrub to a height of thirty feet and a diameter of one.\r\n    Little use is made of it.\r\n\r\n    SILKY WILLOW (_Salix sitchensis_), known also as Sitka willow,\r\n    ranges from Alaska to southern California. The largest specimens are\r\n    twenty-five feet high and ten inches in diameter. Trunks are largely\r\n    sapwood and are of little commercial importance.\r\n\r\n    BROADLEAF WILLOW (_Salix amplifolia_), known also as feltleaf\r\n    willow, was discovered in Alaska in 1899. The leaves are woolly. The\r\n    largest trees rarely exceed a height of thirty feet and a diameter\r\n    of six inches. Its range extends to the valley of the Mackenzie\r\n    river.\r\n\r\n    A number of foreign willows have become naturalized in the United\r\n    States. Among them is white willow (_Salix alba_), which grows to\r\n    large size, probably as large as black willow; crack willow (_Salix\r\n    fragilis_), so named on account of the brittleness of its twigs; and\r\n    weeping willow (_Salix babylonica_). The botanical name is based on\r\n    the supposition that it was this willow, growing by the rivers near\r\n    Babylon, on which the captive Hebrews hung their harps. Basket\r\n    willow is planted for its osiers in several eastern states. It is\r\n    not a single species, but a group of varieties developed by\r\n    cultivation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHARDY CATALPA\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HARDY CATALPA]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHARDY CATALPA\r\n\r\n(_Catalpa Speciosa_)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis tree belongs to the family _Bignoniaceæ_ which has its name from\r\nAbbé Bignon, librarian of Louis XV. About one hundred genera belong to\r\nthis family, only three of which reach the size of trees in the United\r\nStates. These include the catalpas, the desert willow, and the black\r\ncalabash tree.\r\n\r\nSeven species of catalpa are known, two of them occurring in the United\r\nStates. Others are found in China and the West Indies. The name is an\r\nIndian word and was first heard among the tribes of the Carolinas. It\r\nseems probable that the name catalpa as applied to a tree and catawba,\r\napplied to a grape, have the same origin, and in some way refer to the\r\nCatawba Indians, a small tribe--said to be Sioux--that lived two hundred\r\nyears ago in the western part of the Carolinas and neighboring regions\r\nwhere one of the catalpa species was first heard of by Europeans. The\r\ntree in that region is still often called catawba.\r\n\r\nThe two catalpas of this country are known to botanists as _Catalpa\r\nspeciosa_ and _Catalpa catalpa_. Much confusion has resulted from\r\nattempts to distinguish one from the other. Botanists are able to clear\r\nthe matter up among themselves, but the general public has not been so\r\nsuccessful. John P. Brown, of Connersville, Indiana, specialized on\r\ncatalpas during many years, and published numerous tracts, pamphlets,\r\nand books for the purpose of educating the public to the point where the\r\ndifferences between common catalpa and hardy catalpa could be\r\ndistinguished. His labor was likewise directed toward inducing land\r\nowners to plant catalpa for commercial purposes. Due to his efforts, and\r\notherwise, catalpa was for a time the most advertised plantation tree in\r\nthis country. Some supposed that hardy catalpa was the wood which was to\r\nsave the country from a threatened timber famine. Claims made for it\r\nwere wide and far reaching.\r\n\r\nThe judgment of history has been--if it may be classed as a matter of\r\nhistory--that the tree fell short of expectation. This does not imply an\r\ninferiority of the wood itself, or a slower rate of growth than was\r\nclaimed for it; but exceptional cases were interpreted as averages, and\r\nfor that reason the whole situation was overestimated. When all\r\nconditions are perfect, hardy catalpa grows rapidly and grows large, but\r\nit demands nearly perfect conditions or it will disappoint. It wants\r\nground rich enough and damp enough to grow good crops of corn, and\r\nfarmers are not generally willing to put that class of land to growing\r\nfence posts and railroad ties.\r\n\r\nThe range of hardy catalpa before the species was spread by artificial\r\nplanting, was through southern Illinois and Indiana, southeastern\r\nMissouri and northeastern Arkansas, western Louisiana and eastern Texas,\r\nand western Kentucky and Tennessee. Its position on the fertile banks of\r\nstreams, and on flood plains subject to frequent inundation, indicates\r\nthat the spread of the species was effected by running water. In that\r\ncase, the dispersal of seeds would be down stream, implying that the\r\nstarting place of the species was along the lower reaches of the Wabash\r\nriver.\r\n\r\nThe catalpa may reach a height of 100 or 120 feet and a diameter of four\r\nfeet; but few trees attain that size. The leaves are ten or twelve\r\ninches long and seven or eight wide, and are considerably larger than\r\nthose of common catalpa. The flowers appear late in May or early in\r\nJune, and are showy. The prevailing colors are white and purple, and the\r\nblossoms are about two inches long and two and a half wide.\r\n\r\nThe fruit is a pod from eight to twenty inches long, and the enclosed\r\nseeds are nearly an inch long, shaped like beans. The trees are prolific\r\nbearers.\r\n\r\nThe tree is known by several names in different parts of its range,\r\nincluding the territory where it is known only from plantings. It is\r\ncalled western catalpa to distinguish it from the other species found\r\nfarther east and south. In Missouri and Iowa it is known as cigar tree.\r\nThe name Indian bean is an allusion to the large seeds. Shawneewood is\r\nanother name referring to the supposed interest of Indians in the tree.\r\nShawnee was the name of a tribe of Indians in the Ohio valley in early\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nThe wood weighs less than twenty-six pounds per cubic foot, and is soft\r\nand weak. It is rated very durable in contact with the soil, and this is\r\none of the chief advantages claimed for it. The annual rings are clearly\r\nmarked by several bands or rows of large open ducts, and the denser\r\nsummerwood forms a narrow band. The medullary rays are numerous and\r\nobscure. The heartwood is brown, the sapwood lighter. In appearance, the\r\nheartwood suggests butternut, but it is coarser, and lacks the gloss\r\nshown by polished butternut. Quarter-sawing produces no figure, but when\r\nsawed at right angles to the radial lines, the annual rings are cut in a\r\nway to give figure resembling that of ash or chestnut.\r\n\r\nThe wood of this catalpa has been thoroughly tried out for a number of\r\npurposes. Furniture and finish have been made of it with varying\r\nsuccess, and molding and picture frames are listed among its uses. It is\r\nnot a sawlog tree. Statistics of lumber cut seldom mention it, though\r\nnow and then a log finds its way to a mill. Efforts have been made to\r\npass the wood as mahogany, but with poor success. The counterfeit is\r\neasily detected, since the artificial color which may be imparted to\r\ncatalpa is about the only resemblance to mahogany.\r\n\r\nIn the lower Mississippi valley some success, but on a very small scale,\r\nhas resulted from attempts to induce catalpa to grow in crooks suitable\r\nfor small boat knees. The young trunk, after being hacked on one side,\r\nis bent and induced to grow the crook or knee. Natural crooks have been\r\nutilized in the manufacture of knees for small boats in Louisiana.\r\n\r\nProbably ninety per cent of all the catalpa ever cut has gone into fence\r\nposts. It is habitually crooked. A straight bole is the exception;\r\nthough in plantations trees are crowded and pruned until they grow\r\nfairly straight, and sometimes trunks of forest grown trees of large\r\nsize are nearly faultless in their symmetry.\r\n\r\nIt was once believed in some quarters that catalpa would solve the\r\nrailroad tie problem by growing good ties quickly. It must be admitted,\r\nhowever, that in spite of extensive plantings, the railroad tie problem\r\nhas not yet been solved by catalpa.\r\n\r\nCOMMON CATALPA (_Catalpa catalpa_) originated many hundred miles outside\r\nthe range of hardy catalpa, to judge by the localities in which it was\r\nfirst found by white men. It is supposed to have been indigenous in\r\nsouthwestern Georgia, central Alabama, and Mississippi, and northwestern\r\nFlorida. Its range has been greatly extended by planting, and it grows\r\nin most parts of the country east of the Rocky Mountains, as far north\r\nas New England. It has been planted in many parts of Europe. Its leaves,\r\nflowers, fruit, and the tree itself are smaller than hardy catalpa. The\r\npods hang unopened all winter. The trunks sometimes are three feet in\r\ndiameter and sixty high, but are generally small, crooked, rather\r\nangular, and poor in appearance, but the leaves and flowers are\r\nornamental. The wood is durable in contact with the ground, and its\r\nlargest use has been for posts, crossties, and poles.\r\n\r\nDESERT WILLOW (_Chilopsis linearis_) does not even belong to the willow\r\nfamily, notwithstanding its names, all of which are based on the\r\npresumption that it is a willow. The shape and size of its leaves are\r\nresponsible for that misapprehension. The very narrow leaves may be a\r\nfoot long. It is called flowering willow and Texas flowering willow. Its\r\nflowers are always emphasized when it is compared with willow, for they\r\nare totally different from the willow’s characteristic catkins. The\r\nflowers appear in early summer in racemes three or four inches long, and\r\ncontinue open during several months in succession. The fruit is a pod\r\nseven or nine inches long, and as slender as a lead pencil. It is this\r\npod which gives the plainest hint of its relationship to the catalpas,\r\nfor it is in good standing in the family with them. The seeds resemble\r\nvery small beans with wings at each end. They are light, and the wind\r\ndisperses them. The tree is a prolific seeder.\r\n\r\nThe range of this small tree extends across western Texas, New Mexico,\r\nArizona, Utah, Nevada, into San Diego county, California. The tree\r\noccurs in dry, gravelly, porous soil near the banks of streams and in\r\ndepressions in the desert. The wood is weak and soft, the heart brown,\r\nstreaked with yellow. No use has been found for it. The tree is\r\ncultivated for ornament in Mexico and sometimes in the southern states.\r\nThe flowers look well when they are encountered in the desert. They are\r\nwhite, faintly tinged with purple, with bright yellow spots inside. They\r\nare funnel shaped and have the odor of violets.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCUCUMBER\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CUCUMBER]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCUCUMBER\r\n\r\n(_Magnolia Acuminata_)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis tree is a member of the magnolia family which has ten genera in\r\nNorth America, two of them, magnolia and liriodendron, being trees. The\r\nfamily has its name from Pierre Magnol, a French botanist who died in\r\n1715. The genus magnolia has seven species in the United States, all of\r\nwhich are of tree size. They are evergreen magnolia (_Magnolia fœtida_),\r\nsweet magnolia (_Magnolia glauca_), cucumber (_Magnolia acuminata_),\r\nlargeleaf umbrella (_Magnolia macrophylla_), umbrella tree (_Magnolia\r\ntripetala_), Fraser umbrella (_Magnolia fraseri_), and pyramidal\r\nmagnolia (_Magnolia pyramidata_). The remaining member of the magnolia\r\nfamily is the yellow poplar (_Liriodendron tulipifera_). Though of the\r\nsame family it is of a different genus from the seven other magnolias.\r\n\r\nThe cucumber is the hardiest member of the magnolia family. It is found\r\nin natural growth farther north than any other, yet it has the\r\nappearance of a southern tree. All magnolias look like trees belonging\r\nin the South. Their large leaves indicate as much, and some of them do\r\nnot venture far outside of the warm latitudes. It is one of the oldest\r\nof all the families of broadleaf trees, and it has been a family that\r\nduring an immense period of the earth’s history has clung near the old\r\nhomestead where it came into existence countless ages ago. There were\r\nmagnolias growing in the middle Appalachian region, and eastward to the\r\npresent Atlantic coast, so far in the past that the time can be measured\r\nonly by hundreds of thousands of years. Leaf prints in rocks, which were\r\nonce mud flats, tell the story--though but a page here and there--of the\r\nmagnolia’s ancient history, doubtless antedating by long periods the\r\nearliest appearance of man on earth.\r\n\r\nNext to the yellow poplar, the cucumber tree is the most important\r\nspecies of the magnolia family, at least as a source of lumber. As an\r\nornamental tree it may not equal some of the others, particularly\r\ncertain of the southern species which are evergreen and produce large,\r\nshowy flowers.\r\n\r\nThe cucumber tree receives its name from its fruit, which looks like a\r\ncucumber when seen at a distance, but it is far from being one. Its\r\nintense bitter makes it safe from the attacks of birds and beasts. So\r\nfar as known, it is not eaten, tasted, or touched by any living\r\ncreature--except man. Some of the pioneer settlers, in the days when\r\nthere was precious little to eat on the frontiers, discovered a way of\r\nextracting the bitter from the wild cucumber, and making some sort of a\r\npickle of the remainder; but the art seems to have been lost with the\r\npassing of the pioneers of the Daniel Boone type, and the wild cucumber\r\nnow hangs untouched, and tempts nobody. It is three inches or less in\r\nlength, generally slightly curved, and is green in color until fully\r\nripe. Even the flowers which produce the fruit are green, with the\r\nmerest suggestion of yellow. They are so inconspicuous that few persons\r\never notice them, even though cucumber trees stand in door yards. The\r\nripe cucumbers are dark red or scarlet, or rather the seeds are, which\r\ngrow on the surface like grains of corn on a cob, though fewer in number\r\nand farther apart. Something seems to be lacking in the machinery by\r\nwhich the flowers are fertilized, with the result that often nearly half\r\nthe seeds which ought to cover the surface of the cucumber, fail to\r\nmaterialize. There are many blank spaces representing flowers which the\r\npollen missed.\r\n\r\nThere is likewise something missing in the modus operandi of scattering\r\nthe seeds. They have no wings, and the wind is powerless to carry them.\r\nThey are as bitter as quinine and no bird, squirrel, or mouse will\r\nplant, carry, or touch them. Nature appears to have forgotten to provide\r\nany other means for dispersing the seeds of this remarkable tree. When\r\nseeds are fully ripe, they drop away from the parent fruit--the\r\ncucumber--but the fall of each seed is arrested by a small thread which\r\nsuspends it from one to three inches below the fruit. There the seeds\r\nhang, swinging and dangling in the wind. What part the threads play in\r\nthe economy of nature is not apparent, unless their purpose is to expose\r\nthe seeds to a chance of becoming entangled with the wings, feet, or\r\nfeathers of flying birds, whereby they may be carried away and dropped\r\nin suitable places for growing. There can be no doubt that this happens\r\noccasionally, and constitutes one of the methods of seed dispersal.\r\nOthers are transported by flowing water.\r\n\r\nThe chances seem to be greatly against the survival of the cucumber tree\r\nin competition with maples, birches, pines, and cottonwoods, whose\r\nwinged seeds are wind-borne; or with oaks, hickories, and walnuts whose\r\nheavy, wingless nuts are planted hither and thither by accommodating\r\nsquirrels which are intent only on providing for their own winter wants,\r\nbut in reality are industrious and effective forest planters.\r\nNotwithstanding the disadvantages under which the cucumber tree is\r\nplaced, it has managed to hold its ground in the forest during immense\r\nperiods of time, and it seems to be as firmly established now as ever.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of this tree are from seven to ten inches long, and four to\r\nsix wide. In autumn before they fall they turn a blotched yellow-brown\r\ncolor. The first severe frost brings them all down in a heap. At sunset\r\nthe tree may be laden with leaves, and by the next noon all will be on\r\nthe ground. They are so heavy that the wind does not move them far, and\r\nthey drop in heaps beneath the branches. In color they resemble owl\r\nfeathers, and the suggestion that comes to one’s mind, who happens to\r\npass under a cucumber tree the morning following the first frost, is\r\nthat during the night some prowler picked a roost of owls and scattered\r\nthe feathers on the ground.\r\n\r\nThe range of cucumber extends from western New York to Alabama,\r\nfollowing the Appalachian mountains; and westward to Illinois and\r\nMississippi, appearing west of the Mississippi river in Arkansas. It\r\noccurs on low rocky slopes, the banks of mountain streams, and on rich\r\nbottom land. It is of largest size and is most abundant in the narrow\r\nvalleys in eastern Tennessee and the western parts of the Carolinas. The\r\ntree is from two to four feet in diameter, and sixty to ninety feet\r\nhigh. The trunk is of good form for sawlogs. Among its local names are\r\npointed-leaf magnolia, black lin, magnolia, and mountain magnolia.\r\n\r\nThe wood of cucumber resembles that of yellow poplar in appearance and\r\nin physical properties, except that it is ten per cent heavier than\r\npoplar. It usually passes for that wood at sawmill and factory. The\r\nFederal census credits it with less than a million feet a year as\r\nlumber. That is much too small. It is valuable and finds ready sale.\r\nManufacturers of wooden pumps regard it as the best material for the\r\nbored logs. It is worked into interior finish for houses, flooring for\r\ncars, interior parts of furniture, woodenware, boxes and crates, slack\r\ncooperage, including veneer barrels.\r\n\r\nThe tree is planted for ornament in the northern states and Europe. The\r\nchief value lies in its large, green leaves and symmetrical crown. The\r\nred fruit adds to the tree’s attractiveness late in summer.\r\n\r\n    LARGELEAF UMBRELLA (_Magnolia macrophylla_) is valuable chiefly as a\r\n    sort of ornamental curiosity, on account of its enormous leaves and\r\n    flowers. The leaf is from twenty to thirty inches long and ten to\r\n    twelve wide. It drops in autumn before its green color has undergone\r\n    much change. The leaves lack toughness, and the wind whips them into\r\n    strings long before the summer is ended. Thus what otherwise would\r\n    be highly ornamental becomes somewhat unsightly. When well protected\r\n    from wind by surrounding objects, the leaves fare better and last\r\n    longer. The white, fragrant flowers are likewise remarkable on\r\n    account of size. They are cup-shaped and some of them are almost a\r\n    foot across. They pay a penalty no less severe than the leaves pay,\r\n    on account of large size, and are liable to be thumped and bruised\r\n    by swinging leaves and branches.\r\n\r\n    The largeleaf umbrella is a tree of the southern Appalachian\r\n    mountains although its range extends southwest to Louisiana, and\r\n    northward from there to Arkansas. It is at its best in deep rich\r\n    soil of sheltered valleys, occurring in isolated groups, but never\r\n    in pure forests. It is known as large-leaved cucumber tree,\r\n    great-leaved magnolia, large-leaved umbrella tree, and long-leaved\r\n    magnolia. The fruit is nearly a sphere, from two to three inches in\r\n    diameter, and bright rose color when fully ripe. The seeds are\r\n    two-thirds of an inch long. The smooth, light gray bark is usually\r\n    less than a quarter of an inch thick. Large trees are forty or fifty\r\n    feet high and twenty inches in diameter. It is not considered\r\n    valuable for lumber, because of scarcity and small size. The wood is\r\n    considerably heavier than yellow poplar, and is hard but not strong;\r\n    light brown in color with thick, light yellow sapwood. Reports do\r\n    not show that the wood is put to any use. Planted trees are hardy as\r\n    far north as Massachusetts, and success has attended the tree’s\r\n    introduction in the parks and gardens of southern Europe.\r\n\r\n    YELLOW FLOWERED CUCUMBER TREE (_Magnolia acuminata cordata_) is\r\n    usually considered a variety of the common cucumber tree, rather\r\n    than a separate species. The most noticeable feature is the yellow\r\n    blossom which gives the names by which it is generally known, among\r\n    such being yellow-flowered magnolia, and yellow cucumber tree. It is\r\n    not a garden variety, for it grows wild; but it has been cultivated\r\n    during more than a century, and has undergone changes which are not\r\n    matched by wild trees. The finest forms of the forest variety are\r\n    found on the Blue Ridge in South Carolina, and in central Alabama.\r\n    The cultivated tree is distinguished by its darker green leaves, and\r\n    by its smaller, bright, canary-yellow flowers. The variety has no\r\n    value as a timber tree, but is widely appreciated as an ornament.\r\n    Cultivated trees generally remain small in size, and do not develop\r\n    the long, clean trunks common with the cucumber tree under forest\r\n    conditions.\r\n\r\n    UMBRELLA TREE (_Magnolia tripetala_) is one of the magnolias and\r\n    should not be confounded with the Asiatic umbrella tree often\r\n    planted in yards. The flower is surrounded by a whorl of leaves\r\n    resembling an umbrella, hence the name. It is also known as\r\n    cucumber, magnolia, and elkwood. The range of the tree extends from\r\n    Pennsylvania to Alabama and west to Arkansas. It prefers the margins\r\n    of swamps and the rich soil along mountain streams. Leaves are\r\n    eighteen inches long and half as wide. They fall in autumn. Flowers\r\n    are cup-shaped and creamy-white. The fruit somewhat resembles that\r\n    of the common cucumber tree, but is rose colored when fully ripe.\r\n    Trees are thirty or forty feet high and a foot or more in diameter.\r\n    The brown heartwood is light, soft, and weak, and is used little or\r\n    not at all for commercial purposes. The tree is cultivated for\r\n    ornament in the northern states and in Europe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYELLOW POPLAR\r\n\r\n[Illustration: YELLOW POPLAR]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYELLOW POPLAR\r\n\r\n(_Liriodendron Tulipifera_)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn diameter of trunk the yellow poplar is, next to sycamore, the largest\r\nhardwood tree of the United States, and if both height and trunk\r\ndiameter are considered, it surpasses the sycamore in size. It belongs\r\nto a very old group of hardwoods which have come down from remote\r\ngeological ages, and the species is now found only in the United States\r\nand China. Mature trees are from three to eight feet in diameter and\r\nfrom 90 to 180 in height.\r\n\r\nIt has many names in different parts of its range, but it is never\r\nmistaken for any other tree. The peculiar notched leaf is a sure means\r\nof identification. The resemblance of the flower to the tulip has given\r\nit the name tulip tree in some localities, and botanists prefer that\r\nname. It is so called in Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island,\r\nConnecticut, New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Pennsylvania, Virginia,\r\nWest Virginia, District of Columbia, North Carolina, South Carolina,\r\nGeorgia, Arkansas, Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and Ontario. Wood\r\nusers in New England and in some of the other northern states prefer the\r\nname whitewood and it is so known, in part at least, in New England, New\r\nYork, New Jersey, Delaware, South Carolina, Kentucky, Ohio, Michigan,\r\nand Illinois. Yellow poplar is the name preferred by lumbermen in nearly\r\nall regions where the tree is found in commercial quantities, notably in\r\nNew York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, Virginia, West Virginia,\r\nNorth and South Carolina, Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana,\r\nIllinois, Missouri, and Tennessee. The name is often shortened to\r\npoplar, which is used in Rhode Island, Delaware, North and South\r\nCarolina, Florida, Virginia, West Virginia, Ohio, and Indiana. The name\r\ntulip poplar is less frequently heard, and blue poplar and hickory\r\npoplar are terms used in West Virginia, Virginia, and North Carolina,\r\nbut generally under the impression that they refer to a different form\r\nor species. In Rhode Island it is called popple, in New York cucumber\r\ntree, and canoe wood in Tennessee and in the upper Ohio valley.\r\n\r\nThe botanical range of yellow poplar is wider than its commercial range;\r\nthat is, a few trees are found in regions surrounding the borders of the\r\ndistrict where the tree is profitably lumbered. The boundaries of its\r\nrange run from southwestern Vermont, westward to Lake Michigan near\r\nGrand Haven, southward to northern Florida, and west of the Mississippi\r\nriver in Missouri and Arkansas. The productive yellow poplar timber belt\r\nhas never been that large but has clung pretty closely to the southern\r\nAppalachian mountain ranges and to certain districts lying both east and\r\nwest of them. The best original stands were in Pennsylvania, Maryland,\r\nVirginia, West Virginia, western North Carolina, eastern Kentucky and\r\nTennessee, and in some parts of Ohio and Indiana. However, considerable\r\nquantities of good yellow poplar have been cut in other regions.\r\n\r\nThe physical properties of the wood of yellow poplar fit it for many\r\npurposes but not for all. It is not very strong and is tolerably\r\nbrittle. It is light in weight, medium soft, and is easily worked. The\r\nannual rings of growth are not prominent compared with some of the oaks,\r\nyet select logs show nicely in quarter-sawing. The medullary rays are\r\nnumerous, but small and not prominent, for which reason bright streaks\r\nand flecks are not characteristic of the wood. Yellow poplar is fairly\r\nstiff and elastic, but is not often selected on account of those\r\nqualities. In color it is light yellow or brown. The color gives name to\r\nthe tree. The sapwood is whiter, and it is the abnormally thick sapwood\r\nof some trees which causes them to be called white poplar. The wood has\r\nlittle figure, and it is seldom employed for fine work without stain or\r\npaint of some kind. It is not usually classed as long lasting when\r\nexposed to the weather, yet cases are known where weather boarding of\r\nhouses, and bridge and mill timbers of yellow poplar have outlasted the\r\ngeneration of builders.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of yellow poplar in the country is but a remnant of the\r\nformer enormous supply that covered the rich valleys and fertile coves\r\nin a region exceeding 200,000 square miles. It occupied the best land,\r\nand much was destroyed by farmers in clearing fields. It was not\r\ngenerally found in groves or dense stands, but as solitary trees\r\nscattered through forests of other woods. The trunks are tall and\r\nshapely, the crowns comparatively small. The form is ideal for sawlogs,\r\nand very few trees of America produce a higher percentage of clear,\r\nfirst class lumber. That is because the forest-grown poplar early sheds\r\nits lower branches, and the trunks lay on nothing but clear wood. In the\r\nyellow poplar’s region it was the principal wood of which the pioneers\r\nmade their canoes for crossing and navigating rivers. It is still best\r\nknown by the name canoewood in some regions. It worked easily and was\r\nlight, and a thin-shelled canoe lasted many years, barring floods and\r\nother accidents. Builders of pirogues, keelboats, barges, and other\r\nvessels for inland navigation in early times when roads were few and\r\nstreams were the principal highways of commerce, found no timber\r\nsuperior to yellow poplar. It could be had in planks of great size and\r\nfree from defects, and while not as strong as oak, it was strong enough\r\nto withstand the usual knocks and buffetings of river traffic.\r\n\r\nYellow poplar sawlogs have probably exceeded in number any other wood,\r\nexcept white pine, floated down rivers and creeks to market. The wood\r\nfloats well and lumbermen have usually pushed far up the rivers, ahead\r\nof other lumber operations, to procure it. Enormous drives have gone and\r\nare still going out of rivers in the Appalachian region.\r\n\r\nThe uses of yellow poplar are so many that an enumeration is\r\nimpracticable, except by general classes. These are boxes and\r\nwoodenware, vehicles, furniture, interior finish, and car building.\r\nThere is another class consisting of low-grade work, such as common\r\nlumber, pulpwood, and the like.\r\n\r\nThere is a class of commodities which are usually packed in boxes and\r\nrequire a wood that will impart neither taste nor stain. That\r\nrequirement is met by yellow poplar. It has been an important wood for\r\nboxes in which food products are shipped. It is so used less frequently\r\nnow than formerly because of increased cost, but veneer is employed to a\r\nlarge extent, and while the total quantity of wood going into box\r\nfactories is smaller than formerly, the actual number and contents of\r\npoplar boxes are perhaps about the same. It is a white wood and shows\r\nprinting and stenciling clearly. That is an important point with many\r\nmanufacturers who wish to print their advertisements on the boxes which\r\nthey send out. Woodenware, particularly ironing boards, bread boards,\r\nand pantry and kitchen utensils, are largely made of poplar because it\r\nis light, attractive, and easily kept clean. It is popular as pumplogs\r\nfor the same reason.\r\n\r\nAs a vehicle wood, yellow poplar is not a competitor of oak and hickory.\r\nThey are for running gear and frames; poplar for tops and bodies. No\r\nwood excels it for wide panels. It receives finish and paint so well\r\nthat it is not surpassed by the smoothest metals. Many of the finest\r\ncarriage and automobile tops are largely of this wood. In case of slight\r\naccidents it resists dints much better than sheet metal.\r\n\r\nCheap furniture was once made of yellow poplar. It now enters into the\r\nbest kinds, and is finished in imitation of costly woods, notably\r\nmahogany, birch, and cherry. No American wood will take a higher polish.\r\nIt is also much employed as an interior wood by furniture manufacturers.\r\nIt fills an important place as cores or backing over which veneers are\r\nglued.\r\n\r\nWhen used as an interior house finish and in car building, it is nearly\r\nalways stained or painted. Many of the broad handsome panels in\r\npassenger cars, which pass for cherry, birch, mahogany, or rosewood, are\r\nyellow poplar, to which the finisher and decorator have given their best\r\ntouches.\r\n\r\nAll poplar lumber is not wide, clear stock, though much of it is. The\r\nlower grades go as common lumber and small trees are cut for pulpwood. A\r\nlarge part of the demand for high-grade yellow poplar is in foreign\r\ncountries, and a regular oversea trade is carried on by exporters.\r\nForeign manufacturers put the wood to practically the same uses as the\r\nbest grades in this country.\r\n\r\nYellow poplar seasons well, and is a satisfactory wood to handle. When\r\nthoroughly dry it holds its shape with the best of woods. Bluing is apt\r\nto affect the green wood if unduly exposed. Fresh poplar chips in damp\r\nsituations sometimes change to a conspicuous blue color within a day or\r\ntwo. However, millmen do not experience much difficulty in preventing\r\nthe bluing of the lumber.\r\n\r\nGYMINDA (_Gyminda grisebachii_) is also called false boxwood, and\r\nbelongs to the staff family. The name gyminda is artificial and\r\nmeaningless. The genus has a single species which occurs in the islands\r\nof southern Florida where trees of largest size are scarcely twenty-five\r\nfeet high and six inches in diameter. The wood is very heavy, hard,\r\nfine-grained, and is nearly black. It is suitable for small articles,\r\nbut it is not known to be so used, and its scarcity renders improbable\r\nany important future use of the wood. The fruit is a small berry,\r\nripening in November. The range of the species extends to Cuba, Porto\r\nRico, and other islands of the West Indies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEVERGREEN MAGNOLIA\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EVERGREEN MAGNOLIA]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEVERGREEN MAGNOLIA\r\n\r\n(_Magnolia Fœtida_)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is not a timber tree of first importance. A few years ago it was\r\nseldom cut except in very small quantities; but it was found to possess\r\ngood qualities, and now it goes regularly to the mills which saw\r\nhardwoods in the region where it grows. The wood of different magnolia\r\ntrees, or even the wood of the same tree, shows lack of uniformity. Some\r\nof it looks like yellow poplar and compares favorably with it in several\r\nparticulars, while other of it is very dark, with hard flinty streaks\r\nwhich not only present a poor appearance, but dull the tools of the\r\nwoodworking machines and create an unfavorable impression of the wood\r\ngenerally. This magnolia holds pretty closely to the damp lands in all\r\nparts of its range. The amount of the annual cut is not known, because\r\nit goes in with the minor species in most places and no separate account\r\nis taken. It is coming into more notice every year, and some\r\nmanufacturers have been so successful in finding ways to make it\r\nserviceable that the best grades are easily sold. The wood does not hold\r\nits color very well. The light-colored sapwood is apt to become darker\r\nafter exposure to the air, and the dark heartwood fades a little. The\r\ntree is so handsome in the forest that it is occasionally spared when\r\nthe surrounding trees are removed.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful if any American tree surpasses it as an ornament when its\r\nleaves, trunk, flowers, and bark are considered. It is not perfect in\r\nall of these particulars; in fact, it possesses some serious faults. The\r\ncrown is often too small for the tree’s height; the branches straggle,\r\nmany on some parts of the trunk and few on others; the flowers are\r\nobjectionable because of strong odor which is unpleasant to most people.\r\nBut these shortcomings are more than compensated for by splendid\r\nqualities. The rich, dark green of the leaves, their size and profusion,\r\ntheir changeless luster, place them in a position almost beyond the\r\nreach of rivalry from any other tree.\r\n\r\nThose who see this splendid inhabitant of the forest only where it has\r\nbeen planted in northern states, and elsewhere outside of its natural\r\nrange, miss much of the best it has to give. It belongs in the South.\r\nThe wet lands, the small elevations in deep swamps, the flat country\r\nwhere forests are dense, are its home. The yellowish-green trunk rises\r\nthrough the tangled foliage that keeps near the ground, and towers fifty\r\nfeet above, and there spreads in a crown of green so deep that it is\r\nalmost black. It likes company, and seldom grows solitary. Its\r\nassociates are the southern maples, red gum, tupelo, cypress, a dozen\r\nspecies of oak, and occasionally pines on nearby higher ground.\r\nFestoons of grayish-green Spanish moss often add to the tropical\r\ncharacter of the scene. The moss seldom hangs on the magnolia, but is\r\nfrequently abundant on surrounding trees.\r\n\r\nLumbermen formerly left the evergreen magnolia trees on tracts from\r\nwhich they cut nearly everything else. Large areas which had once been\r\nregarded as swamps were thus converted into parks of giant magnolias,\r\nmany of which towered seventy or eighty feet. The tracts were left wild,\r\nand those who so left them had no purpose of providing ornament, but\r\nthey did so. Many a scene was made grand by its magnolias, after other\r\nforest growth had been cut away.\r\n\r\nThe range of evergreen magnolia is from North Carolina to Florida and\r\nwest to Arkansas and Texas. The species reaches largest size in the\r\nvicinity of the Mississippi, both east and west of it. Trees eighty feet\r\nhigh and four feet in diameter occur, and trunks are often without limbs\r\none-half or two-thirds their length, when they grow in forests.\r\n\r\nThe common name for the tree in most parts of its range is simply\r\nmagnolia, though that name fails to distinguish it from several other\r\nspecies, some of which are associated with it. Occasionally it is called\r\nbig laurel, great laurel magnolia, laurel-leaved magnolia, laurel, and\r\nlaurel bay. Bull bay is a common name for it in Georgia, Alabama, and\r\nMississippi. It is called bat tree, but the reason for such a name is\r\nnot known.\r\n\r\nLeaves are from five to eight inches long and two or three wide, and\r\ndark green above, but lighter below. They fall in the spring after\r\nremaining on the branches two whole years.\r\n\r\nThe odor of the flowers is unpleasant, but they are attractive to the\r\nsight, being six or eight inches across, with purple bases. The\r\nflowering habit of this tree is all that could be desired. It is in\r\nbloom from April till August.\r\n\r\nThe fruit resembles that of the other magnolias and is three or four\r\ninches long and two or less wide. Its color is rusty-brown. The ripe\r\nseeds hang awhile by short threads, according to the habit of the\r\nfamily. The wood is stronger than poplar, fully as stiff, and nearly\r\nfifty per cent heavier. The annual rings are rather vaguely marked by\r\nnarrow bands of summerwood. Pores are diffuse, plentiful, and very\r\nsmall. Medullary rays are larger than those of yellow poplar, and show\r\nfairly well in quarter-sawed stock. The wood is compact and easily\r\nworked, except when hard streaks are encountered. The surface finishes\r\nwith a satiny luster; color creamy-white, yellowish-white, or often\r\nlight brown. Occasionally the wood is nearly diametrically the opposite\r\nof this, and is of all darker shades up to purple, black, and blue\r\nblack. The appearance of the dark wood suggests decay, but those who\r\npass it through machines, or work it by hand, consider it as sound as\r\nthe lighter colored wood.\r\n\r\nThe uses of magnolia are much the same in all parts of its range, and\r\nthose of Louisiana, where the utilization of the wood has been studied\r\nmore closely than in other regions, indicate the scope of its\r\nusefulness. It is there made into parts of boats, bar fixtures, boxes,\r\nbroom handles, brush backs, crates, door panels, dugout canoes,\r\nexcelsior, furniture shelving, interior finish, ox yokes, panels, and\r\nwagon boxes. In Texas where the annual consumption probably exceeds a\r\nmillion feet, it is employed by furniture makers, and appears in window\r\nblinds, packing boxes, sash, and molding. In Mississippi, fine mantels\r\nare made of carefully selected wood, quarter-sawed to bring out the\r\nsmall, square “mirrors” produced by radial cutting of the medullary\r\nrays.\r\n\r\nEvergreen magnolia has long been planted for ornament in this country\r\nand Europe. It survives the winters at Philadelphia. Several varieties\r\nhave been developed by cultivation and are sold by nurseries.\r\n\r\nSouthern forests have contributed, and still contribute, large\r\nquantities of magnolia leaves for decorations in northern cities during\r\nwinter. The flowers are not successfully shipped because they are easily\r\nbruised, and they quickly lose their freshness and beauty.\r\n\r\n    SWEET MAGNOLIA (_Magnolia glauca_) ranges from Massachusetts to\r\n    Texas and south to Florida. It reaches its largest size on the\r\n    hummock lands of the latter state. Trees are occasionally seventy\r\n    feet high and three or more in diameter, but in many parts of its\r\n    range it is small, even shrubby. Among the names by which it is\r\n    known are white bay, swamp laurel, swamp sassafras, swamp magnolia,\r\n    white laurel, and beaver-tree. It inhabits swamps in the northern\r\n    part of its range, hence the frequency of the word “swamp” in\r\n    coining names for it. Beaver-tree as a name is probably due to its\r\n    former abundance about beaver dams, where impounded water made the\r\n    ground swampy. In the North, sweet magnolia’s chief value is in its\r\n    flowers, which are two or three inches across, creamy-white, and\r\n    fragrant. They were formerly very abundant near the mouth of the\r\n    Susquehanna river in Maryland and Pennsylvania, and northward\r\n    through New Jersey; but the traffic in the flowers has destroyed the\r\n    growth in many places where once plentiful. It is not important as a\r\n    timber resource, but it is employed for a number of useful purposes\r\n    where logs of fair size may be had. The sapwood is creamy-white, but\r\n    the heart is nearly as dark as mahogany, and in Texas it is used to\r\n    imitate that wood. The brown and other shades combine with fine\r\n    effect. One of its common uses is for broom handles. Heartwood is\r\n    worked into high-grade chairs. It takes a beautiful polish.\r\n\r\n    FRASER UMBRELLA (_Magnolia fraseri_) ranges south from the Virginia\r\n    mountains to Florida and west to Mississippi. It is of largest size\r\n    in South Carolina where trees are sometimes thirty feet high and a\r\n    foot or more in diameter. The leaves fall in autumn of the first\r\n    year; the creamy-white, sweetly-scented flowers are eight or ten\r\n    inches in diameter, and the fruit resembles that of the other\r\n    magnolias. The wood is weak, soft, and light. The heart is clear\r\n    brown, the sapwood nearly white. It has not been reported in use for\r\n    any commercial purpose. Among its other names it is known as\r\n    long-leaved cucumber tree, ear-leaved umbrella tree, Indian bitters,\r\n    water lily tree, and mountain magnolia. In cultivation this species\r\n    is hardy as far north as Massachusetts, and it is planted for\r\n    ornament in Europe.\r\n\r\n    PYRAMID MAGNOLIA (_Magnolia pyramidata_) seems to have generally\r\n    escaped the notice of laymen, and it therefore has no English name\r\n    except the translation of the Latin term by which botanists know it.\r\n    Its habitat lies in southern Georgia and Alabama, and western\r\n    Florida, and it is occasionally seen in cultivation in western\r\n    Europe. It is a slender tree, twenty feet or more in height. Its\r\n    flowers are three or four inches in diameter, and creamy-white in\r\n    color. A tree so scarce cannot be expected to be commercially\r\n    important.\r\n\r\n    WESTERN BLACK WILLOW (_Salix lasiandra_) is a rather large tree when\r\n    at its best, reaching a diameter of two feet or more, and a height\r\n    of fifty, but in other parts of its range it rarely exceeds ten feet\r\n    in height. It follows the western mountain ranges southward from\r\n    British Columbia into California. The wood is soft, light, and\r\n    brittle, and is used little if at all. Lyall willow (_Salix\r\n    lasiandra lyalli_) is a well marked variety of this species and is a\r\n    tree of respectable size.\r\n\r\n    GLOSSYLEAF WILLOW (_Salix lucida_) is a far northern species which\r\n    has its southern limit in Pennsylvania and Nebraska. It grows nearly\r\n    to the Arctic circle. Trees twenty-five feet high and six or eight\r\n    inches in diameter are the best this species affords.\r\n\r\n    LONGLEAF WILLOW (_Salix fluviatilis_) is known also as sandbar\r\n    willow, narrowleaf willow, shrub, white, red, and osier willow, and\r\n    by still other names. It ranges from the Arctic circle to Mexico,\r\n    reaching Maryland on the Atlantic coast, and California on the\r\n    Pacific. In rare cases it is sixty feet high, and two in diameter,\r\n    but it is usually less than twenty feet high.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAHOO\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WAHOO]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAHOO\r\n\r\n(_Evonymus Atropurpureus_)\r\n\r\n\r\nNo one seems to know what the original meaning of the word wahoo was. It\r\nis applied to no fewer than six different trees in this country, four of\r\nthem elms, one a basswood, and one the tree now under consideration. The\r\ngeneric name, _Evonymus_, appears to be an effort to put somebody’s seal\r\nof approval on the name, for it means in the Greek language “of good\r\nname.”\r\n\r\nIt belongs to the family _Celastraceæ_, which means the staff family.\r\nSome designate members of this group as “Spindle trees,” because\r\nformerly in Europe the wood was employed for knitting needles, hooks for\r\nembroidering, spindles for spinning wheels, and the like. Unless the\r\nmembers of the family in Europe have wood quite different from that of\r\nthe wahoo tree in this country, no adequate reason can be found for the\r\nuse of the wood for spindles or staffs, because it is poor material for\r\nthat purpose. It may be compared with basswood.\r\n\r\nThis beautiful little tree, scarcely more than a shrub in most regions\r\nof its growth, is a widely distributed species, its range extending\r\nthrough western New York to Nebraska, southeastern South Dakota and\r\neastern Kansas, and in the valley of the upper Missouri river, Montana,\r\nsouthward to northern Florida, southern Arkansas and Oklahoma. In these\r\nlocalities it is generally a shrub, rarely reaching a height of more\r\nthan nine or ten feet. It attains the proportions of a tree only in the\r\nbottom lands of southern Arkansas, Oklahoma, and in the lower\r\nAppalachian regions. The most favorable habitat of the tree is moist\r\nsoil along the banks of streams. In the southern and western parts of\r\nits range, under favorable conditions of soil and climate, and when\r\nisolated from other species, the wahoo tree grows to rather large size\r\nand develops a wide flat top of slender spreading branches.\r\n\r\nThe largest and most beautiful specimens of wahoo grow in the\r\nmountainous regions of West Virginia, eastern Tennessee, and western\r\nNorth Carolina. In these sections it is no unusual thing for a tree of\r\nthis species to attain a height of sixty or seventy feet and a diameter\r\nof twenty or twenty-four inches. It is never found in pure stands but is\r\nisolated along the edge of the forest, and thrives best near water\r\ncourses.\r\n\r\nThe tree is known by a variety of names in the different parts of the\r\ncountry. The Indians are said to have called it wahoo. Burning bush, a\r\nvery popular name, is especially appropriate, as no brighter dash of\r\ncolor is displayed by any tree than the scarlet fruit of this growth,\r\nwhich remains on the branches long after the leaves have fallen, often\r\nuntil the winter storms beat it to the ground. The growth is also\r\ncalled occasionally by the name bleeding-heart tree, in reference to the\r\nblood-red contents revealed by the bursting fruit.\r\n\r\nThe wahoo in the fall of the year may be identified by the flaming color\r\nof its fruit, or rather the seeds of the fruit. The hull bursts and\r\nexposes the bright red seeds within. These, contrary to the usual run of\r\nred fruits, are not of a glossy surface, and in this the tree is unique.\r\nDuring the summer season, however, identification is not such a simple\r\nmatter, for the foliage is quite ordinary, and the flat, unassuming\r\nflowers have little that is distinctive about them; but as the autumn\r\napproaches and the leaves turn a pale yellow color, the tree becomes a\r\nconspicuous and beautiful object with its scarlet berries.\r\n\r\nThe bark of the wahoo is ashen gray, thin, furrowed, and divided into\r\nminute scales. On the branchlets it is a dark purplish-brown, later\r\nbecoming brownish-gray.\r\n\r\nThe heartwood of wahoo is white, with a slight tinge of orange. The\r\nsapwood, scarcely distinguishable from the heartwood, is more nearly\r\nwhite in tone. The wood is heavy and close-grained but not very hard. It\r\nweighs when seasoned a little less than forty pounds to the cubic foot.\r\nSuch of this wood as is sawed into lumber, which is but a small\r\nquantity, sells commercially with poplar saps, thus masquerading like\r\nits forest fellow, the cucumber tree. The character of the wood is such\r\nthat it will not stand exposure to the weather any length of time. It is\r\nfar from durable, but is remarkably clear from defects and answers\r\nadmirably many purposes for which sap poplar is desirable.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of the tree are waxy in appearance, opposite, entire,\r\nelliptical or ovate in shape, from two to four inches long, one to two\r\nbroad. They are finely serrate and pointed at both apex and base, and\r\nthe stems are short and stout.\r\n\r\nThe flowers, which appear in May and June, are definitely four-parted,\r\npresenting a Maltese cross in shape. They are half an inch across, and\r\ntheir rounded petals are deep purple in color. The fruit which succeeds\r\nthese flowers and which ripens in October is also four-parted. It is\r\nabout half an inch across, a pale purple when full size, and hangs on\r\nlong slender stems. When ripe the purple husk bursts and reveals the\r\nseed enveloped in a scarlet outer coat that fits it loosely. The leaves,\r\nbark, and fruit of the wahoo are acrid and are reputed to be poisonous.\r\n\r\nThe wood is one-third heavier than that of yellow poplar, and it is\r\nevident that it would not pass as poplar with any one disposed to reject\r\nit. It is also much harder than poplar, and is more difficult to season,\r\nas it checks badly. The medullary rays are so thin as to be scarcely\r\ndiscernible. The wood contains many very small pores. The bark is said\r\nto possess some value for medicinal purposes. No special uses for the\r\nwood have been reported, and it is too scarce to be of much value. The\r\ntree’s principal importance is as an ornament, and it shows well in\r\nwinter borders where the bright colors of the seeds are exposed. It is\r\nplanted both in this country and in Europe. The plantings seldom or\r\nnever reach tree size.\r\n\r\nFLORIDA BOXWOOD (_Schæfferia frutescens_) is of the same family as wahoo\r\nbut of another genus, and is quite a different kind of tree. The generic\r\nname is in honor of Jakob Christian Schaeffer, a distinguished German\r\nnaturalist who died in 1790. Two species of this tree occur in the\r\nUnited States, one the Florida boxwood, the other a small, shrubby\r\ngrowth in the dry regions of western Texas and northern Mexico. Florida\r\nboxwood is a West Indies tree which flourishes in the Bahamas and\r\nsouthward along the other islands to Venezuela. It has gained a foothold\r\non the islands of southern Florida where it has found conditions\r\nfavorable and it grows to a height of thirty or forty feet, and reaches\r\na trunk diameter of ten inches, but such are trees of the largest size.\r\nThe leaves are bright yellow-green, about two inches long, and one or\r\nless in width. They appear in Florida in April and persist a full year,\r\nuntil the foliage of the succeeding crop displaces them. The flowers\r\nwhich are small and inconspicuous, open about the same time as the\r\nleaves. The fruit is a scarlet berry which ripens in November, and has a\r\ndecidedly disagreeable flavor. The bark is very thin.\r\n\r\nWhen sound wood in sufficiently large pieces is obtainable it is\r\nvaluable for a number of purposes, but chiefly as a substitute for\r\nTurkish boxwood as engraving blocks. The trees are always small in\r\nFlorida, which is the only place in the United States where they occur,\r\nand the largest are often hollow or otherwise defective. The wood weighs\r\n48.27 pounds per cubic foot, thoroughly dry, which is about two pounds\r\nheavier than white oak. It is rich in ashes, having about four times as\r\nmuch as white oak. The color of the heartwood is a bright, clear yellow\r\nto which is due the name yellow-wood occasionally applied to the tree in\r\nthe region where it grows, as well as in markets where it is sold. This\r\nis not the tree known in commerce as West Indies boxwood, though it may\r\nbe an occasional substitute. It is said that Florida boxwood was\r\nformerly much more abundant in this country than it is now. It was\r\nlumbered for the European market at about the same time that the south\r\nof Florida was stripped of its mahogany. It is suitable for many small\r\narticles where a hard, even-grained wood is wanted.\r\n\r\nIRONWOOD (_Cyrilla racemiflora_) ranges from the coast region of North\r\nCarolina to Florida, and west near the coast to Texas. It is known as\r\nleatherwood, burnwood, burnwood bark, firewood, red titi, and white\r\ntiti. Ten woods besides this are called ironwood in some parts of this\r\ncountry. The name is applied because the hardness of the wood suggests\r\niron. It is not remarkable for its weight nor its strength. The\r\nmedullary rays are thin and inconspicuous. In color it is brown, tinged\r\nwith red. It is not apparent why it is a favorite fire wood, for its\r\nfuel value does not rate high theoretically, being much below many\r\nspecies with which it is associated. The largest trees rarely exceed a\r\nheight of thirty feet and a diameter of twelve inches. They flourish in\r\nshady river bottoms and along the borders of sandy swamps and shallow\r\nponds.\r\n\r\nThe tree occasionally assumes the form of a bush and sends up many stems\r\nwhich produce almost impenetrable thickets. Aside from its use as fuel,\r\nit is in small demand anywhere. In Texas it is sometimes made into\r\nwedges, and similar uses for it are doubtless found in other regions\r\nwhere it is abundant. It is named from Domenico Cirillo, an Italian\r\nnaturalist who died in 1799.\r\n\r\nTITI (_Cliftonia monophylla_) is of the _cyrilla_ family and is one of\r\nthree species which occasionally pass under that name. It sometimes\r\nreaches a height of fifty feet and a diameter of one or more. Its range\r\nfollows the coast region from South Carolina to Louisiana. It betakes\r\nitself to swamps and flourishes in situations that would be fatal to\r\nmany species. Half under water during many months of the year it is\r\nplaced at no disadvantage. It grows equally well in shallow swamps which\r\nare rarely overflowed. Near the southern limits of its range in Florida\r\nit is reduced to a shrub. It is known as ironwood and buckwheat tree.\r\nThe last name is due to its seeds which are about the size of a\r\nbuckwheat grain and otherwise resemble it. The flowers appear in early\r\nspring on long racemes, and are very fragrant. The wood weighs about\r\nthirty-nine pounds per cubic foot, is not strong, but is moderately\r\nhard. It is valuable as fuel and burns with a clear, bright flame.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMOUNTAIN LAUREL\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MOUNTAIN LAUREL]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMOUNTAIN LAUREL\r\n\r\n(_Kalmia Latifolia_)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis tree belongs to the heath family and not to the laurels, as the\r\nname seems to imply. The same is true of rhododendron. The kalmia genus\r\nhas five or six species in this country, but only one of tree size, and\r\nthen only when at its best. Mountain laurel reaches its best development\r\nin North and South Carolina in a few secluded valleys between the Blue\r\nRidge and the western mountains of the Appalachian ranges. The largest\r\nspecimens are forty or fifty feet high and a foot or a foot and a half\r\nin diameter. Trunks are contorted and unshapely, and lumber is never\r\nsawed from them.\r\n\r\nThe tree has many names, most of them, however, are applied to the\r\nspecies in its shrubby form. A common name is simply laurel, but that\r\ndoes not distinguish it from the great laurel which is often associated\r\nwith it. Calico bush is one of its names, and is supposed to be\r\ndescriptive of the flowers. Spoonwood is one of its northern names,\r\ndating back to the times when early settlers, who carried little\r\nsilverware with them to their frontier homes, augmented the supply by\r\nmaking spoons and ladles of laurel roots. Ivy is a common name,\r\nsometimes mountain ivy, or poison ivy. Poison laurel and sheep laurel\r\nare among the names also. The leaves are poisonous, and if sheep feed on\r\nthem, death is apt to follow. The exact nature of the poison is not\r\nunderstood. Sheep seldom feed on the leaves, and do so only when driven\r\nby hunger. Other names are small laurel, wood laurel, and kalmia. The\r\nlast is the name of the genus, and is in honor of Peter Kalm, a Swedish\r\nnaturalist.\r\n\r\nThe species is found from New Brunswick to Louisiana, but principally\r\namong the ranges of the Appalachian mountains. Its thin bark makes it an\r\neasy prey to fire and the top is killed by a moderate blaze. The root\r\ngenerally remains uninjured and sends up sprouts in large numbers.\r\nThickets almost impenetrable are sometimes produced in that way.\r\n\r\nFlowers and foliage of mountain laurel are highly esteemed as\r\ndecorations, foliage in winter, and the flowers in May and June. The\r\nbloom appears in large clusters, and various colors are in evidence,\r\nwhite, rose, pink, and numerous combinations. The seeds are ripe in\r\nSeptember, and the pods which bear them burst soon after.\r\n\r\nThe wood of mountain laurel weighs 44.62 pounds per cubic foot. It is\r\nhard, strong, rather brittle, of slow growth, brown in color, tinged\r\nwith red, with lighter colored sapwood. This description applies to the\r\nwood of the trunk; but in nearly all cases where mention is made of the\r\nwood of this tree, it refers to the roots. These consist of enlargements\r\nor stools, often protruding considerably above the ground. If the area\r\nhas been visited repeatedly by fire, the roots are generally out of\r\nproportion to the size of the tops. In that respect they resemble\r\nmesquite, except that the enlarged root of mesquite penetrates far\r\nbeneath the surface while that of mountain laurel remains just below the\r\nsurface or rises partly above it.\r\n\r\nThe utilization of mountain laurel is not confined to the trunks which\r\nreach tree size. Generally it is the root that is wanted. Roots are\r\nusually sold by weight, because of the difficulty of measuring them as\r\nlumber or even by the cord. The annual product of this material in North\r\nCarolina alone amounts to about 85,000 pounds, all of which goes to\r\nmanufacturers of tobacco pipes and cigar holders. The use of the laurel\r\nroot for pipes is as old as its use for spoons. Pioneers who raised and\r\ncured their own tobacco smoked it in pipes which were their own\r\nhandiwork. The laurel root was selected then as now because it carves\r\neasily, is not inclined to split, does not burn readily, and darkens in\r\ncolor with age. It is cheap material, is found throughout an extensive\r\nregion, and the supply is so large that exhaustion in the near future is\r\nnot anticipated.\r\n\r\nThe wood is employed in the manufacture of many small articles other\r\nthan tobacco pipes. Paper knives, small rulers, turned boxes for pins\r\nand buttons, trays, plaques, penholders, handles for buckets, dippers,\r\nand firewood, are among the uses for which laurel is found suitable.\r\n\r\nIt is of no small importance for ornamental purposes, and is often seen\r\ngrowing in clumps and borders in public parks and private yards, where\r\nits evergreen foliage and its bloom make it a valuable shrub. It is\r\nplanted in Europe as well as in this country.\r\n\r\nGREAT LAUREL (_Rhododendron maximum_) is also in the heath family. More\r\nthan two hundred species of _rhododendron_ are known, and seventeen are\r\nin this country, but only one attains tree size. The generic name means\r\n“rose tree,” and the name is well selected. The flowers are the most\r\nconspicuous feature belonging to this species, and few wild trees or\r\nshrubs equal it for beauty. It is not native much west of the Alleghany\r\nmountains, but grows north and east to Nova Scotia. It is at its best\r\namong the mountains, thrives in deep ravines where the shade is dense,\r\nand on steep slopes and stony mountain tops. It forms extensive thickets\r\nwhich are often so deep and tangled that it is difficult to pass through\r\nthem. This laurel is seldom found growing on limestone. It reaches its\r\nlargest size in the South. Trees thirty or forty feet high and a foot in\r\ndiameter occur in favored localities. It grows on the Alleghany\r\nmountains in West Virginia at an elevation exceeding 4,000 feet and\r\nthere forms vast thickets. Some use is made of the wood for engraving\r\nblocks and as tool handles. It is hard, strong, brittle, of slow growth,\r\nand light clear brown. It is frequently planted in parks in this country\r\nand Europe, and three or more varieties are distinguished in\r\ncultivation. This laurel’s leaves have a peculiar habit of shrinking and\r\nrolling up when the thermometer falls to zero or near it. Among the\r\nnames applied to it are great laurel, rose bay, dwarf rose bay tree,\r\nwild rose bay, bigleaf laurel, deer tongue, laurel, spoon hutch, and\r\nrhododendron.\r\n\r\nCATAWBA RHODODENDRON (_Rhododendron catawbiense_) is a rare,\r\nlarge-flowered species of the mountain regions from West Virginia\r\nsouthward to Georgia and Alabama. The wood is not put to use, and the\r\nspecies is chiefly valuable as an ornamental shrub. It seldom reaches\r\nlarge size.\r\n\r\nSOURWOOD (_Oxydendrum arboreum_) follows the Alleghany mountain ranges\r\nsouth from Pennsylvania, and extends into Florida, reaching the Atlantic\r\ncoast in Virginia, and Indiana, Tennessee, and Louisiana westward. The\r\nbest development of the species is found among the western slopes of the\r\nBig Smoky mountains in Tennessee. It is called sorrel-tree, sour gum,\r\nand sour gum bush, on account of the acidity of the leaves when chewed.\r\nArrow-wood, another name, refers to the long, straight stems between the\r\nwhorls of branches of young trees--those three or four feet high. The\r\nstems are of proper size for arrows, and amateur bowmen use them. Those\r\nwho designate the tree as lily-of-the-valley have in mind the flowers.\r\nThe shape suggests an opening lily, but the size does not. The flower is\r\nabout one-third of an inch long, but panicles several inches long are\r\ncovered with them. They open in July and August, and in September the\r\nfruit is ripe. The seed is pale brown and one-eighth of an inch long.\r\n\r\nThe sourwood tree at its best is fifty or sixty feet high and from\r\ntwelve to eighteen inches in diameter. The bark of young trees is\r\nsmooth, but on mature trunks it resembles the exceedingly rough bark of\r\nan old black gum. In fact, many people suppose this tree to be black\r\ngum, never having noticed the difference of leaf, fruit, and flower. The\r\ngenus consists of a single species. The wood is heavy, hard, compact,\r\nand it takes good polish. The medullary rays are numerous, but thin, and\r\nthey contribute little or nothing to the figure of the wood. The annual\r\nrings show little difference between springwood and summerwood, and\r\nconsequently produce poor figure when the lumber is sawed tangentially.\r\nThe pores are many and small and are regularly distributed through the\r\nyearly ring. Heartwood is brown, tinged with red, the sapwood lighter.\r\nThe strength and elasticity of sourwood are moderate. The wood is made\r\ninto sled runners in some of the mountain districts where it occurs, but\r\nno particular qualities fit it for that use. It is occasionally employed\r\nfor machinery bearings. It has been reported for mallets and mauls, but\r\nsince it is not very well suited for those articles, the conclusion is\r\nthat those who so report it have confused it with black gum which it\r\nresembles in the living tree, but not much in the wood. Small handles\r\nare made of it, and it gives good service, provided great strength and\r\nstiffness are not required. Sourwood is not abundant anywhere, and\r\nseldom are more than a few trees found in a group.\r\n\r\n    TREE HUCKLEBERRY (_Vaccinium arboreum_) is the only tree form of\r\n    twenty-five or thirty species of huckleberry in this country. The\r\n    cranberry is one of the best known species. The range of tree\r\n    huckleberry extends from North Carolina to Texas, and it reaches its\r\n    largest size in the latter state where trunks thirty feet high and\r\n    ten inches in diameter occur, but not in great abundance. The fruit\r\n    which this tree bears has some resemblance to the common\r\n    huckleberry, but is inferior in flavor, besides being dry and\r\n    granular. It ripens in October and remains on the branches most of\r\n    the winter. The fruit is about a quarter of an inch in diameter,\r\n    dark and lustrous, and is a conspicuous and tempting bait for\r\n    feathered inhabitants of swamp and forest. The bark of the roots is\r\n    sometimes used for medicine, and that from the trunk for tanning,\r\n    but it is too scarce to become important in the leather industry.\r\n    The tree is known in different parts of its range as farkleberry,\r\n    sparkleberry, myrtle berry, bluet, and in North Carolina it is known\r\n    as gooseberry. The wood is hard, heavy, and very compact; is liable\r\n    to warp, twist, and check in drying; polishes with a fine, satiny\r\n    finish. Medullary rays are numerous, broad, and conspicuous; wood\r\n    light brown, tinged with red. Small articles are turned from it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOSAGE ORANGE\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OSAGE ORANGE]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOSAGE ORANGE\r\n\r\n(_Toxylon Pomiferum_)\r\n\r\n\r\nOsage orange belongs to the mulberry family. There are fifty-four\r\ngenera, three of which are found in the United States, the mulberries,\r\nthe Osage orange, and the figs. Osage orange is known by several names,\r\nthe principal one of which refers to the Osage Indians, who formerly\r\nlived in the region where the tree grows. It is called orange because\r\nthe fruit, which is from two to five inches in diameter, looks like a\r\ngreen orange, but it is unfit for food. In its range most people call it\r\nbodark or bodock, that being a corruption of the name by which the\r\nFrench designated it, bois d’arc, which means bow wood. It was so called\r\nfrom the fact that Indians made bows of it when they could get nothing\r\nbetter. Its value as material for bows seems to be traditional and\r\ngreatly overestimated. It is lower in elasticity than white oak and very\r\nmuch lower than hickory, and, theoretically, at least, it is not well\r\nsuited for bows. The wood is known also as mock orange, bow-wood, Osage\r\napple tree, yellow-wood, hedge, and hedge tree. The last name is given\r\nbecause many hedges have been made of it.\r\n\r\nOsage orange has been planted in perhaps every state of the Union, and\r\ngrows successfully in most of them. It is one of the most widely\r\ndistributed of American forest trees, but its distribution has been\r\nchiefly artificial. It was found originally in a very restricted region,\r\nfrom which it was carried for hedge and ornamental planting far and\r\nwide. Its natural home, to which it was confined when first discovered,\r\nembraced little more than ten thousand square miles, and probably half\r\nof that small area produced no trees of commercial size. Its northern\r\nlimit was near Atoka, Oklahoma, its southern a little south of Dallas,\r\nTexas; a range north and south of approximately one hundred miles. Its\r\nbroadest extent east and west was along Red River, through Cooke,\r\nGrayson, Fanning, Lamar, and Red River counties, Texas, about 120 miles.\r\nSome Osage orange of commercial size grew outside the area thus\r\ndelimited, but no large amount. Much of that region, particularly south\r\nof Red River, was prairie, without timber of any kind; but scattered\r\nhere and there were belts, strips, thickets, and clumps of Osage orange\r\nmixed with other species. On the very best of its range, and before\r\ndisturbed by white men, this wood seldom formed pure stands of as much\r\nas 100 acres in one body, and since the country’s settlement, the stands\r\nhave become smaller or have been entirely cleared to make farms. All\r\naccounts agree that the Osage orange reaches its highest development on\r\nthe fertile lands along Boggy and Blue rivers in Oklahoma, though fine\r\nbodies of it once grew south of the Red River in Texas, and much is\r\nstill cut there though the choicest long ago disappeared. Few trees are\r\nless exacting in soil, yet when it can make choice it chooses the best.\r\nIn its natural habitat it holds its place in the black, fertile flats\r\nand valleys, and is seldom found on sandy soil. It is not a swamp tree,\r\nthough it is uninjured by occasional floods. The tracts where it grows\r\nare sometimes called “bodark swamps,” though marshy in wet weather only.\r\n\r\nThe tree attains a height of fifty or sixty feet when at its best, but\r\nspecimens that tall are unusual. Trunks are occasionally two or three\r\nfeet in diameter, but that size is very rare. At the present time\r\nprobably ten trees under a foot in diameter are cut for every one over\r\nthat size.\r\n\r\nRough and unshapely as Osage trees are, they have been more closely\r\nutilized than most timbers. Fence posts are the largest item. The board\r\nmeasure equivalent of the annual cut of posts has been placed at\r\n18,400,000. The posts are shipped to surrounding states, in addition to\r\nfencing nearly 40,000 square miles of northern Texas and southern\r\nOklahoma. Houseblocks constitute another important use. These are short\r\nposts set under the corners of buildings in place of stone foundations.\r\nThe annual demand for this kind of material amounts to about 1,000,000\r\nboard feet. An equal amount goes into bridge piling. The principal\r\ndemand comes from highway commissioners. Telephone poles take a\r\nconsiderable quantity, and insulator pins more.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important uses of Osage orange is found in the\r\nmanufacture of wagon wheels, though the total quantity so used is\r\nsmaller than that demanded for fence posts.\r\n\r\nAbout 10,000 or 12,000 wagons with Osage orange felloes or rims are\r\nmanufactured annually in the United States. That use of the wood is not\r\nnew. It began in a small way soon after the settlement of the region. At\r\nfirst the work was hand-done by local blacksmiths and wheelwrights. They\r\nfound the wood objectionable, from the workman’s standpoint, on account\r\nof its extreme hardness and the difficulty of cutting it. That objection\r\nis still urged against it though machines have taken the place of the\r\nhand tools of former times. Saws and bits are quickly dulled, and the\r\ncost of grinding, repair, and replacement increases the operator’s\r\nexpense much above ordinary mill outlay for such purposes. On that\r\naccount many prefer to work the wood green. It is then softer, and cuts\r\nmore smoothly. If seasoned before it is passed through the machines it\r\nis liable to “pull.” That term is used to indicate a rough-breaking of\r\nthe fibres by the impact of knives. The readiness with which the wood\r\nsplits calls for extraordinary care in boring it, and many felloes are\r\nspoiled in finishing them to receive the tenoned ends of spokes.\r\n\r\nA number of commodities are made of Osage orange but in quantities so\r\nsmall that the total wood used does not constitute a serious drain upon\r\nthe supply. Police clubs are occasionally made as a by-product of the\r\nrim mill. Some years ago at the Texas state fair at Dallas, a piano was\r\nexhibited, all visible wood being Osage orange, handsomely polished. The\r\nrich color of this wood distinguishes it from all other American\r\nspecies. When oiled it retains the yellow color, but unoiled wood fades\r\non long exposure. Clock cases of Osage have been manufactured locally,\r\nand gun stocks made of it are much admired, though the wood’s weight is\r\nan argument against it for gun stocks. Canes split from straight-grained\r\nblocks, and shaved and polished by hand, are occasionally met with, but\r\nnone manufactured by machinery have been reported. Sawmills in the Osage\r\norange region use the wood as rollers for carriages and off-bearing\r\ntables. Rustic rockers and benches of the wood, with the bark or without\r\nit, figure to a small extent in local trade. It has been tried\r\nexperimentally for parquetry floors, with satisfactory results. Sections\r\nof streets have been paved with Osage orange blocks. The wood wears well\r\nand is nearly proof against decay, but no considerable demand for such\r\nblocks appears ever to have existed. Railroads which were built through\r\nthe region years ago cut Osage for ties and culvert timber, but no such\r\nuse is now reported. The demand for the wood for tobacco pipes is\r\nincreasing, more than 100,000 blocks for such pipes having been sold\r\nduring a single year.\r\n\r\nOsage orange weighs 48.21 pounds per cubic foot. It is twenty-eight per\r\ncent stronger than white oak, but is not quite as stiff, is very\r\nbrittle, and under heavy impact, will crumble. For that reason, Osage\r\nwagon felloes will not stand rocky roads. The bark is sometimes used for\r\ntanning, and the wood for dyeing.\r\n\r\n    RED MULBERRY (_Morus rubra_) is frequently spoken of simply as\r\n    mulberry, and is sometimes called black mulberry. The full grown\r\n    fruit is red, but turns black or very dark purple when ripe. The\r\n    berry is composed of a compact and adhering cluster of drupes, each\r\n    drupe about one thirty-second of an inch long. What seems to be a\r\n    single berry is really an aggregation of very small fruits, each\r\n    resembling a tiny cherry. The mulberry is naturally a forest tree,\r\n    but it is permitted to grow about the margins of fields, and is\r\n    often planted in door yards for its fruit and its shade. It is\r\n    looked upon by many as a tame species.\r\n\r\n    Two mulberries grow naturally in this country. The red species\r\n    ranges from Massachusetts west to Kansas, and south to Texas and\r\n    Florida. Its best growth is found in the lower Ohio valley and the\r\n    southern foot hills of the Appalachian mountains. The largest trees\r\n    are seventy feet high and three or four in diameter. If this tree\r\n    were abundant the wood’s place in furniture and finish would be\r\n    important. The heartwood is dark, of good figure, and fairly strong.\r\n    It takes a fine polish, and resembles black walnut, though usually\r\n    of a little lighter shade. Its largest use is as fence posts. It is\r\n    durable in contact with the soil. The effect when made into\r\n    furniture, finish, and various kinds of turnery, is pleasing. Farm\r\n    tools, particularly scythe snaths, are made of it, and it has been\r\n    reported for slack cooperage and boat building, but such uses are\r\n    apparently infrequent. The wood is evidently sold under some other\r\n    name, or without a name, for the total sawmill output in the United\r\n    States is given in government statistics at only 1,000 feet, which\r\n    is probably not one per cent of the cut.\r\n\r\n    MEXICAN MULBERRY (_Morus celtidifolia_) ranges from southern Texas\r\n    to Arizona. Trees are seldom more than thirty feet high and one in\r\n    diameter. The berry is about half an inch long, black, and made up\r\n    of a hundred or more very small drupes. It is edible, but its taste\r\n    is insipid. The wood is heavy and is of dark orange or dark brown\r\n    color. It is suitable for small turnery and other articles, but no\r\n    reports of uses for it have been found. The tree is occasionally\r\n    planted for its fruit by Mexicans, but Americans care little for it.\r\n\r\n    Two foreign mulberries have been extensively planted in this\r\n    country, and in some localities they are running wild and are\r\n    mistaken for native species. One is the white mulberry (_Morus\r\n    alba_), a native of China; the other is the paper mulberry\r\n    (_Broussonetia papyrifera_) a different genus, but of the same\r\n    family. It is a native of Japan, and has been naturalized in some of\r\n    the southern states. Nine varieties of the white mulberry have been\r\n    distinguished in cultivation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPERSIMMON\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PERSIMMON]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPERSIMMON\r\n\r\n(_Diospyros Virginiana_)\r\n\r\n\r\nPersimmon belongs to the ebony family, and the family has contributed to\r\nthe civilization of the human race since very early times. Some of the\r\noldest furniture in existence, that which was found hidden in the ruins\r\nof ancient Egypt, is ebony, and there is evidence among the old records\r\nin the land of the Nile that the Egyptians made voyages southward\r\nthrough the Red sea and brought back cargoes of ebony from Punt, a\r\nregion in eastern Africa. The name ebony is believed to be derived from\r\na Hebrew word, probably brought to Palestine by some of Solomon’s\r\ncaptains who traded along the south coast of Asia or the east coast of\r\nAfrica about the time of the building of the first temple. The botanical\r\nname for the genus (_diospyros_) is made up of two words meaning\r\n“Jupiter’s wheat”--supposed to be a reference to the value of persimmons\r\nas food. The name, however, is not as old as the Hebrew word, nor is the\r\nHebrew as old as the references to ebony in the records of Egypt. A\r\npiece of the old furniture--not less than 4,000 years old--is still in\r\nexistence. It probably matches in age the cedar of Lebanon coffins in\r\nthe oldest Egyptian tombs.\r\n\r\nThe ebony family consists of five genera, one of which is persimmon\r\n(_diospyros_). This genus consists of 160 species, only two of them in\r\nthe United States. Thus the persimmon trees of this country are a very\r\nsmall part of the family to which they belong, but they are a highly\r\nrespectable part of it. The word persimmon is of Indian origin, and was\r\nused by the tribes near the Atlantic coast. The original spelling was\r\n“pessimin,” and that was probably about the pronunciation given it by\r\nthe aborigines.\r\n\r\nIt has never been called by many names. It is known as date plum in New\r\nJersey and Tennessee, and as possumwood in Florida. The avidity with\r\nwhich opossums feed on the fruit is responsible for the name.\r\n\r\nThe range of persimmon extends from Connecticut to Florida, and westward\r\nto Iowa, Missouri, and Texas. It reaches its largest size in the South.\r\nIt is of vigorous growth, spreading by means of seeds, and also by\r\nroots. The latter is the most common method where the ground is open.\r\nSuch situations as old, abandoned fields invite the spread of\r\npersimmons. Roots ramify under the ground, and sprouts spring up, often\r\nproducing thickets of an acre or more. Trees do not generally reach\r\nlarge size if they grow in that way, but their crowded condition does\r\nnot make them fruitless as can be attested to by many a boy who\r\npenetrates the persimmon thickets by means of devious paths that wind\r\nwith many a labyrinthic turn which takes in all that is worth finding.\r\n\r\nThe variation in the quality of persimmons is greater than that of most\r\nwild fruits. Nature usually sets a standard and sticks closely to it,\r\nbut the rule is not adhered to in the case of persimmons. Some are twice\r\nas large as others; some are never fit to eat, no matter how severely or\r\nhow often they are frosted; others require at least one fierce frost to\r\nsoften their austerity; but some may be eaten with relish without the\r\nameliorating influence of frost.\r\n\r\nThe austerity of a green persimmon is due to tannin. It is supposed that\r\ncultivation might remove some of this objectionable quality, but no\r\ngreat success has thus far attended efforts in that direction. Japanese\r\npersimmons, which are of a different species, are cultivated with\r\nsuccess in California.\r\n\r\nThe sizes of persimmon trees vary according to soil, climate, and\r\nsituation. They average rather small, but occasionally reach a height of\r\n100 feet and a diameter of nearly two. Mature trunks are usually little\r\nover twelve inches in diameter, and many never reach that size.\r\n\r\nThe dry wood weighs 49.28 pounds per cubic foot, which is about the\r\nweight of hickory. It is hard, strong, compact, and is susceptible of a\r\nhigh polish. The yearly rings are marked by one or more bands of open\r\nducts, and scattered ducts occur in the rest of the wood. The medullary\r\nrays are thin and inconspicuous; color of heartwood dark brown, often\r\nnearly black; the sapwood is light brown, and frequently contains darker\r\nspots.\r\n\r\nThe value of persimmon depends largely upon the proportion of sapwood to\r\nheartwood. That was the case formerly more than it is now; for until\r\nrecent years the heartwood of persimmon was generally thrown away, and\r\nthe sapwood only was wanted; but demand for the heart has recently\r\nincreased. There is much difference in the proportion of heartwood to\r\nsapwood in different trees. It does not seem to be a matter of size, nor\r\nwholly of age. Small trunks sometimes have more heart than large ones. A\r\ntree a hundred years old may have heartwood scarcely larger than a lead\r\npencil, and occasionally there is none. In other instances the heart is\r\ncomparatively large.\r\n\r\nPersimmon has never been a wood of many uses, as hickory and oak have\r\nbeen. In early times it was considered valuable almost wholly on account\r\nof its fruit, and that had no commercial value, as it was seldom offered\r\nfor sale in the market. In the language of the southern negroes who\r\nfully appreciated the fruit, it was “something good to run at”--meaning\r\nthat the ripe persimmons were gathered and eaten from the trees while\r\nthey lasted, but that few were preserved.\r\n\r\nIt is recorded that the “small wheel” of the pioneer cabins was\r\noccasionally made of persimmon wood. The wheel so designated was the\r\nmachine on which wool and flax were spun by the people in their homes.\r\nSpinning wheels were of two kinds, one large, with the operator walking\r\nto and fro, the other small, with the operator sitting. It was the small\r\nwheel which was sometimes made of persimmon. There is no apparent reason\r\nwhy it should have been made of that wood in preference to any one of a\r\ndozen others.\r\n\r\nThe demand for persimmon in a serious way began with its use as shuttles\r\nin textile factories. Weavers had made shuttles of it for home use on\r\nhand looms for many years before the demand came from power looms where\r\nthe shuttles were thrown to and fro by machinery. Up to some thirty\r\nyears ago, shuttles for factories were generally made of Turkish\r\nboxwood, but the supply fell short and the advance in price caused a\r\nsearch for substitutes. Two satisfactory shuttlewoods were found in this\r\ncountry, persimmon and dogwood. The demand came not only from textile\r\nmills in America but from those of Europe. The manufacture of shuttle\r\nblocks became an industry of considerable importance.\r\n\r\nPersimmon wood is suitable for shuttles because it wears smooth, is\r\nhard, strong, tough, and of proper weight. Most woods that have been\r\ntried for this article fail on account of splintering, splitting,\r\nquickly wearing out, or wearing rough. The shuttle is not regarded as\r\nsatisfactory unless it stands 1,000 hours of actual work. Some woods\r\nwhich are satisfactory for many other purposes will not last an hour as\r\na shuttle.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of shuttles, after the square has been roughed out,\r\nrequires twenty-two operations. Probably more shuttlewood comes from\r\nArkansas than from any other section, though a dozen or more states\r\ncontribute persimmon. The total sawmill cut of this wood in the United\r\nStates is about 2,500,000 feet, but this does not include that which\r\nnever passes through a sawmill.\r\n\r\nThe wood has other uses. It has lately met demand from manufacturers of\r\ngolf heads. Skewers are made of it in North Carolina, and billiard cues\r\nand mallets in Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nThe heartwood is dark and shuttle makers and golfhead manufacturers will\r\nnot have it. Until recently it was customary to throw it away, because\r\nno sale for it could be found. It is now known to be suitable for\r\nparquet flooring and for brush backs, and the demand for the heartwood\r\nis as reliable as for the sapwood. A little of the dark wood is cut in\r\nveneer and is employed in panel work, and other is used in turnery.\r\n\r\nThe seeds of persimmon furnished one of the early substitutes for coffee\r\nin backwoods settlements when the genuine article could not be obtained.\r\nThey were parched and pounded until sufficiently pulverized. During the\r\nCivil war many a confederate camp in the South was fragrant with the\r\naroma of persimmon seed coffee, after the soldiers had added the fruit\r\nto their rations of cornbread.\r\n\r\nMEXICAN PERSIMMON (_Diospyros texana_) grows in Texas and Mexico. It is\r\nmost abundant in southern and western Texas, where it suits itself to\r\ndifferent soils, is found on rich moist ground near the borders of\r\nprairies, and also in rocky canyons and dry mesas. The largest trees are\r\nfifty feet high and twenty inches in diameter, but trunks that large are\r\nnot abundant. The tree differs from the eastern persimmon in that the\r\nsapwood is thinner, and the heartwood makes up a much greater proportion\r\nof the trunk; the uses are consequently different, since it is taken for\r\nits dark wood, the eastern tree for its light-colored sap. The fruit of\r\nthe Mexican persimmon is little esteemed. It is small, black, and the\r\nthin layer of pulp between the skin and the seed is insipid. Until fully\r\nripe it is exceedingly austere. The Mexicans in the Rio Grande valley\r\nmake a dye of the persimmons and use it to color sheep skins. The\r\nfruit’s supply of tannin probably contributes to the tanning as well as\r\nthe dyeing of the sheep pelts. The wood is heavier than eastern\r\npersimmon, and has more than three fold more ashes in a cord of wood,\r\namounting to about 160 pounds. The bark is thin and the trunk gnarled.\r\nThe dark color of the wood gives it the name black persimmon in Texas.\r\nMexicans call it chapote. Sargent pronounces it the best American\r\nsubstitute for boxwood for engraving purposes, but it does not appear to\r\nbe used outside of Texas. The wood is irregular in color, even in the\r\nsame piece, being variegated with lighter and darker streaks, and cloudy\r\neffects. It ought to be fine brush-back material. It is worked into tool\r\nhandles, lodge furniture, canes, rules, pen holders, picture frames,\r\ncurtain rings, door knobs, parasol handles, and maul sticks for artists.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFLOWERING DOGWOOD\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FLOWERING DOGWOOD]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFLOWERING DOGWOOD\r\n\r\n(_Cornus Florida_)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dogwood or cornel family is old but not numerous. It originated\r\nseveral hundred thousand years ago and spread over much of the world,\r\nbut preferred the temperate latitudes. One species at least crossed the\r\nequator and established itself in the highlands of Peru. There are forty\r\nor fifty species in all, about one-third of them in the United States,\r\nbut most are shrubs. Black gum and tupelo are members of the family, and\r\nare giants compared with the dogwoods. In Europe the tree is usually\r\ncalled cornel, and that has been made the family name. It is a very old\r\nword, coined by the Romans before the days of Caesar. They so named it\r\nbecause it was hard like horn (_cornus_ meaning horn in the Latin\r\nlanguage). They used it as shafts of spears, and so common was that use\r\nthat when a speaker referred to a spear he simply called it by the name\r\nof the wood of the handle or shaft, as when Virgil described a combat\r\nwhich was supposed to have occurred 800 years before the Christian era,\r\nand used the words: “Clogged in the wound the Italian _cornel_ stood.”\r\n\r\nThe qualities of this wood which led to important uses among the Romans,\r\nhave always made dogwood a valuable material. Civilized nations do not\r\nneed it for spear shafts, but they have other demands which call for\r\nlarge amounts.\r\n\r\nThe flowering dogwood has other names in this country. It is generally\r\nknown simply as dogwood, but it is called boxwood in Connecticut, Rhode\r\nIsland, New York, Mississippi, Michigan, Kentucky, and Indiana; false\r\nbox-dogwood in Kentucky; New England boxwood in Tennessee; flowering\r\ncornel in Rhode Island; and cornel in Texas.\r\n\r\nIts range extends from Massachusetts through Ontario and Michigan to\r\nMissouri, south to Florida, and west to Texas. The area where it grows\r\nincludes about 800,000 square miles. It is most common and of largest\r\nsize in the South, comparatively rare in the North, generally occurs in\r\nthe shade of taller trees, and prefers well-drained soil, but is not\r\nparticular whether it is fertile or thin.\r\n\r\nThe dogwood is valuable as ornament and for its wood. It was formerly a\r\nsource of medicine, from roots, bark, and flowers; but it seems to have\r\nbeen largely displaced by other drugs; was once considered a good\r\nsubstitute for quinine, that use having been learned from Indian\r\ndoctors. The Indians dug roots for a scarlet dye with which the vain\r\nwarrior stained escutcheons on buckskin, and colored porcupine quills\r\nand bald eagle feathers for decorating his moccasins and his hair.\r\n\r\nThe dogwood varies in size from a shrub with many branches to a tree\r\nforty feet high, eighteen inches in diameter, and with a flat but\r\nshapely crown. The trunk rises as a shaft with little taper, until the\r\nfirst branches are reached. All the branches start at the same place,\r\nand the trunk ends abruptly--divides into branches. Flowers are an\r\nimportant part of the tree, as might be inferred from the prominence\r\ngiven them in the tree’s names. In the South the flowers appear in\r\nMarch, in the North in May, and in both regions before the opening of\r\nthe leaves. The flowers on vigorous trees are three or four inches\r\nacross, white, and very showy. A dogwood tree in full bloom against a\r\nhillside in spring is a most conspicuous object, and is justly admired\r\nby all who have appreciation of beauty. The flowers fall as leaves\r\nappear, and for some months the tree occupies its little space in the\r\nforest unobserved; but in the autumn it bursts again into glory, and\r\nwhile not quite as conspicuous an object as when in bloom, it is no less\r\nworthy of admiration. The fall of the leaves reveals the brilliant\r\nscarlet fruit which ladens the branches. The berries are just large\r\nenough for a good mouthful for a bird, but birds spare them until fully\r\nripe to the harvest, and they then harvest them very rapidly. The tree\r\nis thus permitted to display its fruit a considerable time before\r\nyielding it to the feathered inhabitants of the air whose mission in\r\nforest economy is to scatter the seeds of trees, when nature provides\r\nthe seeds themselves with no wings for flying.\r\n\r\nThe two periods in the year when dogwood is highly ornamental, the\r\nflowers in spring before leaves appear, and fruit in autumn after leaves\r\nfall, are responsible for this tree’s importance in ornamental planting.\r\nIt is a common park tree, but it is small, generally not more than\r\nfifteen feet high, and it occupies subordinate places in the plans of\r\nthe landscape garden. It is a filler between oaks, pines, and spruces,\r\nand it passes unnoticed, except when in bloom and in fruit.\r\n\r\nDogwood is about four pounds per cubic foot heavier than white oak, has\r\nthe same breaking strength, and is lower in elasticity. It is quite\r\ncommonly believed that this tree has no heartwood, but the belief is\r\nerroneous. It seldom has much, and small trunks often none; but when\r\ndogwood reaches maturity it develops heart. Sometimes the heartwood is\r\nno larger than a lead pencil in trunks forty or fifty years old. The\r\nheart is brown, sapwood is white, and is the part wanted by the users of\r\ndogwood. Annual rings are obscure and it is a tree of slow growth. The\r\nwood is as nearly without figure as any in this country. It seldom or\r\nnever goes to sawmills. The logs are too small. Most of the supply is\r\nbought by manufacturers of shuttles and golf stick heads, in this\r\ncountry and Europe. They purchase it by the cord or piece. It does not\r\nfigure much in any part of the lumber business, but is cut and marketed\r\nin ways peculiar to itself. Log cutters in hardwood forests pay little\r\nattention to it. The dogwood harvest comes principally from southern\r\nstates. Village merchants are the chief collectors, and they sell to\r\ncontractors who ship to buyers in the manufacturing centers. The village\r\nmerchants buy from farmers, who cut a stick here and there as they find\r\nit in woodlots, forests, or by the wayside, on their own land or\r\nsomebody else’s. When the cutter next drives to town he throws his few\r\ndogwoods in the wagon, and trades them to the store keeper for groceries\r\nor other merchandise. It is small business, but in the aggregate it\r\nbrings together enough dogwood to supply the trade.\r\n\r\nDogwood has many uses, but none other approaches shuttle making and\r\ngolfhead manufacture in importance. The wood is made into brush blocks,\r\nwedges, engraver’s blocks, tool handles, machinery bearings as a\r\nsubstitute for lignum-vitæ, small hubs, and many kinds of turnery and\r\nother small articles.\r\n\r\nWESTERN DOGWOOD (_Cornus nuttallii_) is a larger, taller tree than the\r\neastern flowering dogwood. A height of 100 feet is claimed for it in the\r\nlow country along the coast of British Columbia, but there are no\r\nauthentic reports of trees so large anywhere south of the boundary\r\nbetween Canada and the United States. Its height ranges from twenty to\r\nfifty feet, and its diameter from six to twenty inches. The appearance\r\nis much the same as its eastern relative. Its berries are red, and grow\r\nin clusters of forty or less; the bark on old trunks is rough, but is\r\nsmooth on those of medium size; the flowers are generally described as\r\nvery large and showy, but the true flower is quite an inconspicuous\r\naffair, being a small, greenish-yellow, button-like cluster, surrounded\r\nby four or six snowy-white or sometimes pinkish scales which are\r\npopularly but erroneously supposed to form a portion of the real flower.\r\nThe western dogwood in its native forest often puts out flowers in\r\nautumn; is well supplied with foliage which assumes red and orange\r\ncolors in the fall when the showy berries are at their best. However,\r\nthe tree has not yet won its way into the good graces of landscape\r\ngardeners, and has not been much planted in parks. It wants some of the\r\ngood points possessed by the flowering dogwood. The western tree shows\r\nto best advantage in its native forest where it thrives on gentle\r\nmountain slopes and in low bottoms, valleys, and gulches, provided the\r\nsoil is well drained and rich. It runs southward fifteen hundred miles\r\nfrom Vancouver island to southern California. It cares little for\r\nsunshine, and often is found growing nicely in dense shade. Seedlings do\r\nbetter where shade is deep. The wood is lighter but somewhat stronger\r\nthan that of the flowering dogwood; is pale reddish-brown, with thick\r\nsapwood; is hard, and checks badly in seasoning. Mature trees are from\r\n100 to 150 years.\r\n\r\nBLUE DOGWOOD (_Cornus alternifolia_) is given that name because of the\r\nblue fruit it bears. It has a number of other names, among them being\r\npurple dogwood, green osier, umbrella tree, pigeonberry, and\r\nalternate-leaved dogwood, the last being simply a translation of its\r\nbotanical name. It grows in more northern latitudes than the flowering\r\ndogwood, and does not range as far south. It is found from Nova Scotia\r\nto Alabama, and westward to Minnesota, but its southern habitat lies\r\nalong the Appalachian mountain ranges. It attains size and assumes form\r\nsimilar to the flowering dogwood. The wood is heavy, hard, brown, tinged\r\nwith red, the sapwood white. It is a deep forest tree, but has been\r\ndomesticated in a few instances where it has been planted as ornament.\r\nThe wood seems to possess the good qualities of flowering dogwood, but\r\nno reports of uses for it have been made.\r\n\r\nTwo varieties of flowering dogwood have been produced by cultivation,\r\nweeping dogwood (_Cornus florida pendula_), and red-bract dogwood\r\n(_Cornus florida rubra_). English cornel or dogwood (_Cornus mas_) has\r\nbeen planted in many parts of this country. The so-called Jamaica\r\ndogwood is not in the dogwood family.\r\n\r\n\r\n    ANDROMEDA (_Andromeda ferruginea_) is a small southern tree of South\r\n    Carolina, Georgia, and Florida, and in the latter state is sometimes\r\n    known as titi, though other trees also bear that name. The largest\r\n    are thirty feet high, if by chance one can be found standing erect,\r\n    for most of them prefer to sprawl at full length on the ground. The\r\n    fruit is a small berry of no value. The wood is weak, but hard and\r\n    sufficiently compact to receive fine polish. The heartwood is light\r\n    brown, tinged with red.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCALIFORNIA LAUREL\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CALIFORNIA LAUREL]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCALIFORNIA LAUREL\r\n\r\n(_Umbellularia Californica_)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis tree’s range lies in southern Oregon and in California. It is a\r\nmember of the laurel family and is closely related to the eastern\r\nsassafras and the red and the swamp bays of the southern states; but it\r\nis not near kin to the eastern laurels which, strange as it may appear,\r\ndo not belong to the laurel family, notwithstanding the names they bear.\r\n\r\nThe people of California and Oregon have several names for this\r\ninteresting tree. It is known as mountain laurel, California bay tree,\r\nmyrtle tree, cajeput, California olive, spice tree, laurel, bay tree,\r\noreodaphne, and California sassafras.\r\n\r\nThose who call it laurel name it on account of its large, lustrous,\r\nthick leaves which adhere to the branches from two to six years. All new\r\nleaves do not come at once, as with most trees, but appear a few at a\r\ntime during the whole summer.\r\n\r\nThe names which connect this tree with sassafras, spice and cajeput are\r\nbased on odor and taste. All members of the laurel family in this\r\ncountry are characterized by pungent, aromatic odor and taste, and the\r\none under consideration shares these properties in a remarkable degree.\r\nWhen the leaves and the green bark are crushed, they give off a light,\r\nvolatile oil in follicles which float in the air, like those of an\r\nonion, and when inhaled it produces severe pain over the eyes, and may\r\ninduce dizziness and violent sneezing. Though the symptoms are alarming\r\nto one who is undergoing the experience for the first time, no serious\r\ninconvenience follows. Dried leaves are capable of producing a similar\r\neffect but with less violence. The California laurel’s close\r\nrelationship to the camphor tree is readily believed by persons who\r\ninhale some of the oily spray from the crushed leaves.\r\n\r\nAttempts have been made to produce the commercial oil of cajeput, or a\r\nsubstitute for it, by distilling the leaves and bark of this laurel. A\r\npassable substitute has been manufactured, but it cannot be marketed as\r\nthe genuine article. By distilling the fruit a product known as\r\numbellulic acid has been obtained.\r\n\r\nThe California laurel carries a very dense crown of leaves. This is due\r\npartly to the old crops which hang so long, and to the tree’s habit of\r\nlengthening its leading shoots during the growing season, and the\r\nconstant appearance of young leaves on the lengthening shoots. It can\r\nstand an almost unlimited amount of shade itself, and is by no means\r\nbackward in giving abundance of shade to small growth which is trying\r\nto struggle up to light from below. It delights in dense thickets, but\r\nit prefers thickets of its own species.\r\n\r\nIts fruiting habits and its disposition to occupy the damp, rich soil\r\nalong the banks of small water courses, are responsible for the thick\r\nstands. The fruit itself is an interesting thing. It is yellowish-green\r\nin color, as large as a good-sized olive, and looks much like it. The\r\nfruit ripens in October, and falls in time to get the benefit of the\r\nautumn rains which visit the Pacific coast. Since the trees generally\r\ngrow along gulches, the fruit falls and rolls to the bottom. The first\r\ndashing rain sends a flood down the gulches, the laurel drupes are\r\ncarried along and are buried in mud wherever they can find a resting\r\nplace. Germination takes place soon after. The fruit remains under the\r\nmud, attached to the roots of the young plants, until the following\r\nsummer.\r\n\r\nThe result is that if a laurel gets a foothold in a gulch through which\r\nwater occasionally flows, lines of young laurels will eventually cover\r\nthe banks of the gulch as far down stream as conditions are favorable.\r\n\r\nThe wood of California laurel weighs 40.60 pounds per cubic foot when\r\nkiln-dried. That is nine pounds heavier than sassafras. It is very heavy\r\nwhen green and sinks when placed in water. It is hard and very firm,\r\nrich yellowish brown in color, often beautifully mottled; but this\r\napplies to the heartwood only, and not to the thick sapwood.\r\n\r\nLumbermen have discovered that the wood’s color can be materially\r\nchanged by immersing the logs when green, and leaving them submerged a\r\nlong time. The beautiful “black myrtle,” which has been so much admired,\r\nis nothing more than California laurel which has undergone the cold\r\nwater treatment.\r\n\r\nThe annual rings of growth are clearly marked by dark bands of\r\nsummerwood. The rings are often wide, but not always, for sometimes the\r\ngrowth is very slow. The wood is diffuse-porous, and the pores are small\r\nand not numerous. The wood’s figure is brought out best by tangential\r\nsawing, as is the case with so many woods which have clearly-marked\r\nrings but small and obscure medullary rays. Figure is not uniform; that\r\nis, one trunk may produce a pattern quite different from another. The\r\nfigure of some logs is particularly beautiful; these logs are selected\r\nfor special purposes. Sudworth says that none of our hardwoods excels it\r\nin beautiful grain when finished, and Sargent is still more emphatic\r\nwhen he declares that it is “the most valuable wood produced in the\r\nforests of Pacific North America for interior finish of houses and for\r\nfurniture.”\r\n\r\nThe wood of this tree has more than ninety per cent of the strength of\r\nwhite oak, is considerably stiffer, and contains a smaller amount of\r\nash, weight for weight of wood. The species reaches its best development\r\nin the rich valleys of southwestern Oregon, where, with the broadleaf\r\nmaple, it forms a considerable part of the forest growth. The largest\r\ntrees are from sixty to eighty feet high, and two to four in diameter.\r\nIn crowded stands the trunks are shapely, and often measure thirty or\r\nforty feet to the first limbs; but more commonly the trunk is short.\r\n\r\nThe boat yards in southwestern Oregon were the first to use California\r\nlaurel for commercial purposes, but early settlers made a point of\r\nprocuring it for fuel when they could. The oil in the wood causes it to\r\nburn with a cheerful blaze, and campers in the mountains consider\r\nthemselves fortunate when they find a supply for the evening bonfire.\r\n\r\nShipbuilders have drawn upon this wood for fifty years for material. It\r\nis made into pilot wheels, interior finish, cleats, crossties, and\r\nsometimes deck planking. Furniture makers long ago made a specialty of\r\nthe wood for their San Francisco trade. For thirty years travelers\r\nadmired the superb furniture of the Palace hotel in that city, and\r\nwondered of what wood it was made. It was the California laurel. The\r\nhotel’s furniture was hand-made, or largely so, at a time when\r\nwoodworking factories were few on the Pacific coast. The furniture was\r\nfinally destroyed in the San Francisco earthquake. Furniture is still\r\none of the products made of the wood, but the quantity is small. Other\r\nproducts are interior finish; fixtures for banks, stores and offices;\r\nmusical instruments, including organs; mathematical instruments, and\r\ncarpenters’ tools, including rulers, straight-edges, spirit levels,\r\nbench screws and clamps, and handles of many kinds.\r\n\r\nMakers of novelties and small turnery find it serviceable for paper\r\nknives, pin trays, match safes, brush backs, and many articles of like\r\nkind. One of the largest uses for it is as walking beams for pumping\r\noilwells in central and southern California. The beauty of grain has\r\nnothing to do with this use.\r\n\r\nCountry blacksmiths repair wagons and agricultural implements with this\r\nwood. Farmers have long employed it about their premises for posts,\r\ngates, floors, and building material. Cooks flavor soup with the leaves,\r\nand poultrymen make henroosts of poles, believing that the wood’s odor\r\nwill keep insects away. This is probably the old sassafras superstition\r\ncarried west by early California settlers.\r\n\r\n\r\n    RED BAY (_Persea borbonia_) is a southern member of the laurel\r\n    family, and close akin to sassafras and the California laurel. The\r\n    bark is red, hence the name; but it is known also as bay galls,\r\n    laurel tree, Florida mahogany, false mahogany, and sweet bay. It\r\n    grows from Virginia to Texas, but is most abundant near the coast,\r\n    yet it ascends the Mississippi valley to Arkansas. The leaves remain\r\n    on the tree a full year, but turn yellow toward the last, in\r\n    consequence of which the species is not evergreen. In shape and\r\n    color the leaves resemble laurel. The fruit is a small, dark blue\r\n    drupe, with thin flesh. The wood is heavy, hard, very strong,\r\n    rather brittle, bright red, with thin, lighter-colored sapwood. It\r\n    was once very popular in the South for furniture. Rare pieces, some\r\n    150 years old, are still found in southern homes. The wood was\r\n    exported prior to 1741 from the Carolinas, and the quantity seems to\r\n    have been considerable. It was then regarded as a finer wood than\r\n    mahogany. It was exported to the West Indies, where mahogany was\r\n    abundant, and was made into furniture and finish for the homes of\r\n    wealthy planters and merchants. An old report describes the wood as\r\n    resembling “watered satin.” It was in early demand by shipbuilders,\r\n    but it has now ceased to go to boat yards. Except in rare instances,\r\n    it is not reported by any wood-using industries. In Texas a little\r\n    is made into pin trays, small picture frames, canes, and shelves. It\r\n    deserves a more important place, for when polished and finished, it\r\n    is one of the handsomest woods of this country. Trees attain a\r\n    height of sixty or seventy feet, and a diameter of two or three.\r\n\r\n    SWAMP BAY (_Persea pubescens_) attains a height of thirty or forty\r\n    feet, but is seldom more than a foot in diameter, and is too small\r\n    for saw timber. The wood is strong, heavy, rather soft, orange\r\n    colored, streaked with brown, and not as handsome as its larger\r\n    relative, red bay, which is associated with it from North Carolina\r\n    to Mississippi. It is an evergreen in some cases, but in others the\r\n    leaves turn yellow the second spring. The black fruit is a drupe\r\n    nearly an inch long. The wood is without attractive figure, since\r\n    its medullary rays are obscure, and the annual rings are indistinct\r\n    and produce little contrast when the trunks are sawed tangentially.\r\n    Color is the chief attraction that can be claimed for the wood. A\r\n    little is occasionally worked into interior finish.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCUST\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LOCUST]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCUST\r\n\r\n(_Robinia Pseudacacia_)\r\n\r\n\r\nLocust belongs to the pea family, known in botany as _Leguminosæ_.[6] In\r\nmost parts of its range it is known simply as locust, but in some\r\nlocalities it is called black locust, an allusion to the color of the\r\nbark; yellow locust, descriptive of the heartwood; white locust,\r\nreferring to the bloom; red locust, probably a reference to the wood,\r\nand green locust for the same reason; acacia and false acacia; honey\r\nlocust, a name which belongs to another species; post locust, because it\r\nhas always been a favorite tree for fence posts; and pea-flower locust,\r\na reference to the bloom.\r\n\r\n    [6] This is a very large family, containing trees, shrubs, and\r\n    vines, such as locusts, acacias, beans, and clovers. There are 430\r\n    genera in the world, and many times that many species. The United\r\n    States has seventeen genera and thirty species of the pea family\r\n    that are large enough to be classed as trees. Their common names\r\n    follow: Florida Cat’s Claw, Huajillo, Texan Ebony, Wild Tamarind,\r\n    Huisache, Texas Cat’s Claw, Devil’s Claw, Leucæna, Chalky Leucæna,\r\n    Screwbean, Mesquite, Redbud, Texas Redbud, Honey Locust, Water\r\n    Locust, Coffeetree, Horsebean, Small-leaf Horsebean, Greenbark\r\n    Acacia, Palo Verde, Frijolito, Sophora, Yellow-wood, Eysenhardtia,\r\n    Indigo Thorn, Locust, New Mexican Locust, Clammy Locust, Sonora\r\n    Ironwood, Jamaica Dogwood. These species are treated separately in\r\n    the following pages, and are given space according to their relative\r\n    commercial importance in the particular regions where they grow.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the names refer to the color of the wood, and seem\r\ncontradictory, for yellow, green, and red are not the same; yet the\r\nnames describe with fair accuracy. Color of the heartwood varies with\r\ndifferent trees, yellow with some, tinged with red with others, and\r\nsometimes it might be appropriately called blue locust, for the\r\nheartwood is nearer that color than any other.\r\n\r\nThe natural range of locust seems to have been confined to the\r\nAppalachian mountain ranges from Pennsylvania to Georgia. It probably\r\nexisted as a low shrub in parts of Arkansas and Oklahoma. Its range has\r\nbeen extended by planting until it now reaches practically all the\r\nstates, but is running wild in only about half of them. It has received\r\na great deal of attention from foresters and tree planters. It attracted\r\nnotice very early, because of its hardness, strength, and lasting\r\nproperties. At one time the planting of locust came nearly being a fad.\r\nIn England it was supposed that it would rise to great importance in\r\nshipbuilding, and in France it was looked upon as no less important.\r\nBooks were written on the subject in both English and French. All the\r\ndetails of planting and utilization were discussed. Its generic name,\r\n_Robinia_, is in honor of a Frenchman, Robin. Extravagant claims were\r\nonce made for the wood. When American ships were gaining victory after\r\nvictory over English vessels in the war of 1812, it was asserted in\r\nEngland that the cause of American success was the locust timber in\r\ntheir ships. The claim may have been partly true, but other factors\r\ncontributed to the phenomenal series of successes.\r\n\r\nThe locust craze died a natural death. Too much was claimed for the\r\nwood. Possibilities in the way of growth were over estimated. It was\r\nassumed that the tree, if planted, would grow everywhere as vigorously\r\nas on its native mountains in Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia,\r\nwhere trees two or three feet in diameter and eighty feet high were\r\nfound. Experience proved later that nature had planted the locust in the\r\nbest place for it, and when transplanted elsewhere it was apt to fall\r\nshort of expectations. Outside of its natural range it grows vigorously\r\nfor a time, and occasionally reaches large size; but in recent years the\r\nlocust borer has defeated the efforts of man to extend the range of this\r\nspecies and make it profitable in regions distant from its native home.\r\nThe tree is often devoured piecemeal, branches and twigs breaking and\r\nfalling, and trunks gradually disappearing beneath the attacks of the\r\nhungry borers. No effective method of combating the pest is known. The\r\nplanting of locust trees, once so common, has now nearly ceased.\r\n\r\nWithin its native range, and beyond that range when it has a chance,\r\nlocust is a valuable and beautiful tree. It is valuable at all times on\r\naccount of the superior wood which it furnishes, and beautiful when in\r\nbloom and in leaf. A locust in full flower is not surpassed in\r\nornamental qualities by any tree of this country. It is a mass of white,\r\nexceedingly rich in perfume. It blooms in May or June. During the summer\r\nits foliage shows tropical luxuriance with exquisite grace. Its compound\r\nleaves are from eight to fourteen inches long, with seven to nine\r\nleaflets. They come late in spring and go early in autumn. The tree’s\r\nthorns, resembling cat claws, are affixed to the bark only, and usually\r\nfall with the leaves. The fruit is a pod three or four inches long, and\r\ncontains four or eight wingless seeds. They depend on animals to carry\r\nthem to planting places. The pods dry on the branches, and rattle in the\r\nwind most of the autumn. The tree spreads by underground roots which\r\nsend up sprouts. A locust in winter is not a thing of beauty. It appears\r\nto be dead; not a bud visible. Its black, angular branches lack every\r\nline of grace.\r\n\r\nLocust wood is remarkable for strength, hardness, and durability. It is\r\nabout one pound per cubic foot lighter than white oak, but is\r\nthirty-four per cent stiffer and forty-five per cent stronger. Its\r\nstrength exceeds that of shagbark hickory, and it is doubtful whether a\r\nstronger wood exists in the United States. Its hardness is equally\r\nremarkable, and is said to be due to crystals formed in the wood cells,\r\nand known as “rhaphides.” Its durability is probably equal to that of\r\nOsage orange, mesquite, and catalpa, but it is not easy to fix a\r\nstandard of durability by which to compare different woods. Locust is\r\nthe best fence post wood in this country, because it is usually much\r\nstraighter than other very durable woods. The posts are expected to last\r\nat least thirty years, and have been known to stand twice that long.\r\n\r\nFor more than 150 years locust was almost indispensable in shipbuilding,\r\nfurnishing the tree nails or large pins which held the timbers together.\r\nIt supplied material for other parts of ships also, but in smaller\r\nquantities. The substitution of steel ships for wooden lessened demand\r\nfor locust pins, and in many instances large iron nails are used to\r\nfasten timbers together. In spite of this, the demand for locust tree\r\nnails is nearly always ahead of supply.\r\n\r\nThe wood’s figure is fairly strong, due to the contrast between the\r\nspringwood and that grown later, but not to the medullary rays, which\r\nare small and inconspicuous. The wood is not in much demand for\r\nornamental purposes. Small amounts are made into policemen’s clubs, rake\r\nteeth, hubs for buggy wheels, ladder rungs, and tool handles.\r\n\r\nThe tree grows rapidly where conditions are favorable, and very slowly\r\nwhen they are not. Usually trees of fence post size are twenty years old\r\nat least, but trunks thirty five years old have been known to produce a\r\npost for each two years of age, though that was exceptional. Railroads,\r\nespecially in Pennsylvania, planted locust largely a few years ago for\r\nties. It has been reported that in some instances expectations of growth\r\nhave not been fully realized.\r\n\r\n    CLAMMY LOCUST (_Robinia viscosa_) was originally confined to the\r\n    mountains of North Carolina and South Carolina where its attractive\r\n    flowers brought it to the notice of nurserymen who have enlarged its\r\n    natural range a hundred if not a thousand fold. It is now grown in\r\n    parks and gardens not only in the United States east of the\r\n    Mississippi river and as far north as Massachusetts, but in most\r\n    foreign countries that have temperate climates. It is usually a\r\n    shrub, but on some of the North Carolina mountains it attains a\r\n    height of forty feet and a diameter of twelve inches. The wood is\r\n    seldom or never used for any commercial purpose. The leaves are from\r\n    seven to twelve inches long, and contain thirteen to twenty-one\r\n    leaflets. The flowers appear in June, possess little odor, and are\r\n    admired solely for their beauty. They are mingled red and rose\r\n    color. The pods are from two to three and a half inches long, and\r\n    contain small, mottled seeds. The wood is hard and heavy, the heart\r\n    brown and the sap yellow. In its wild haunts it is usually a shrub\r\n    five or six feet high.\r\n\r\n    NEW MEXICAN LOCUST (_Robinia neo-mexicana_) is a small southwestern\r\n    tree, seldom exceeding a height of twenty-five feet or a diameter of\r\n    eight inches. It ranges from Colorado to Arizona, and takes its name\r\n    from its presence in New Mexico. It reaches its largest size near\r\n    Trinidad, Colorado. It is found at elevations of 7,000 feet. Leaves\r\n    are from six to twelve inches long, and the leaflets number from\r\n    fifteen to twenty-one. The flowers appear in May and are less showy\r\n    than those of the eastern locust. The wood is heavy, exceedingly\r\n    hard, the heartwood yellow, streaked with brown, the thin sapwood\r\n    light yellow. This locust is occasionally used locally for small\r\n    posts or stakes, but is generally too small. It is sometimes met\r\n    with in cultivation in Europe and the eastern states.\r\n\r\n    TEXAN EBONY (_Zygia flexicaulis_) ranges from the Texas coast\r\n    through Mexico to Lower California. It reaches a height of thirty\r\n    feet or more, and a diameter of two or less. It is a beautiful tree\r\n    along the lower Rio Grande where it reaches its largest size. The\r\n    light yellow or cream-colored, very fragrant flowers bloom from June\r\n    till August; the fruit ripens in Autumn but adheres several months\r\n    to the branches. Mexicans roast the seeds as a substitute for\r\n    coffee. The color of the heartwood gives this tree its name, but it\r\n    is not a true ebony. The wood of the roots is blacker than that of\r\n    the trunk, and small articles made of roots resemble black ebony of\r\n    Ceylon. The trunk wood is liable to be streaked with black, brown,\r\n    and medium yellow. The rings of annual growth are frequently of\r\n    different colors. Considerable demand is made upon this wood in\r\n    Texas for crossties. It is very durable, but is so hard that holes\r\n    must be bored for the spikes. It is sold in large amounts as\r\n    cordwood, and it burns well. Other articles made of this so-called\r\n    ebony are foundation blocks for buildings and rollers for moving\r\n    houses. It is used also for small turnery.\r\n\r\n    HUAJILLO (_Zygia brevifolia_) has no English name, but Americans in\r\n    the Rio Grande valley where this tree grows call it by its Mexican\r\n    name. It is a larger tree in Mexico than on this side of the river.\r\n    It is not often more than thirty feet high and six inches in\r\n    diameter, and is generally a shrub. Its beautiful foliage looks like\r\n    masses of ferns, and the flowers range from white to violet-yellow.\r\n    The wood is dark, hard, heavy, and is seldom used for anything but\r\n    fuel.\r\n\r\n    FLORIDA CAT’S CLAW (_Zygia unguis-cati_), with a Latin name that\r\n    would make Julius Caesar stare and gasp, reaches its largest size in\r\n    the United States on Elliott’s Key, Florida. Its name refers to its\r\n    curved thorns. Trunks twenty-five feet high and eight inches in\r\n    diameter are the largest in this country. It bears pods, but the\r\n    leaves are not compound, thus differing from most trees of the pea\r\n    family. The wood is not put to any use, though it is very hard and\r\n    heavy, rich red, varying to purple, with clear yellow sapwood. It is\r\n    said to check badly in drying. The bark is used for medicine in some\r\n    of the islands of the West Indies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHONEY LOCUST\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HONEY LOCUST]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHONEY LOCUST\r\n\r\n(_Gleditsia Triacanthos_)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis tree has never suffered for want of names, but most of them refer\r\neither to the sweetness of the pod or to the fierceness of the thorns.\r\nThe belief has long prevailed that it was the pods of this tree on which\r\nJohn the Baptist fed while a recluse in the Syrian desert. The tradition\r\nshould not be taken seriously. It was certainly not this tree, if any,\r\nwhich furnished food to the prophet in the wilderness, for it does not\r\ngrow in Syria. Some related species may grow there, for species of\r\n_Gleditsia_ occur in western Asia as well as in China, Japan, and west\r\nAfrica. The generic name is in honor of Johann Gottlieb Gleditsch, a\r\nGerman botanist who died in 1786.\r\n\r\nThe name honey locust refers to the pod, not the flowers. The latter are\r\ngreenish, inconspicuous, and though eagerly sought by bees, they offer\r\nno particular attractions to people. Few persons ever notice them.\r\n\r\nIn some of the southwestern states the tree is called black locust,\r\nthough for what reason it is not apparent. Sweet locust, by which name\r\nit is known in several states, has reference to the pods, as do the\r\nnames honey, and honey-shucks locust, applied in different localities.\r\nMany persons in naming the tree have thorns in mind. It is known as\r\nthree-thorned acacia, thorn locust, thorn tree, thorny locust, and\r\nthorny acacia. The botanist who named it considered thorns a\r\ncharacteristic, for _Triacanthos_ means “three-thorned.”\r\n\r\nNo one who has ever had dealings with the thorns, will fail to duly\r\nconsider them. They are about the most ferocious product of American\r\nforests. The tree’s trunk and largest branches bristle with them,\r\nstanding out like porcupine quills, and sharper than any needle devised\r\nby human ingenuity. Microscopists use them for picking up and handling\r\nminute objects, their points being smooth and delicate though their\r\nshafts may be strong and rough. Thorns are arrested branches, coming\r\nfrom deep down in the wood. No more can one of them be pulled out than a\r\nlimb can be extracted by the roots. They come from the center of the\r\ntree or limb. Some put out leaves and become true branches, but others\r\nsharpen their points, assume an attitude of hostility, and remain thorns\r\nto the end of their lives. Some of them are a foot long, and are so\r\nstrong that birds flying against them are impaled and meet cruel death.\r\nA well-armed trunk is proof against the agility and skill of the\r\nsquirrel. He cannot negotiate the thorns, and probably he tries only\r\nonce. The hot pursuit of a dog will not compel him to attempt it. All\r\ntrees, however, are not formidably thorned; some have few, and certain\r\nvarieties have none.\r\n\r\nThe honey locust is sometimes called the Confederate pin tree in the\r\nSouth. This is a reference to the Civil war, and the use occasionally\r\nmade of the thorns by soldiers in mending the rents in their torn\r\nuniforms. The thorns were once put to a somewhat similar use among the\r\nAlleghany mountains where local factories for carding and spinning\r\ncountry wool employed them to pin up the mouths of wool sacks.\r\n\r\nThe natural range of honey locust has been greatly extended by man. It\r\nwas not originally found east of the Alleghany mountains. It grew from\r\nwestern Pennsylvania to northern Alabama and Mississippi, and westward\r\nto Nebraska and Texas. It is now naturalized east of the Alleghanies,\r\nand southward to the Gulf of Mexico. Planting for ornamental purposes\r\nand for hedges has been the cause of its extension into new territory.\r\nIn spite of thorns, it is ornamental. Its foliage is thin, and its\r\nflowers inconspicuous, but the tree possesses a grace which wins it\r\nfavor. It grows very rapidly, and in a short time a seedling becomes a\r\nrespectable tree, and continues its rapid growth a long time. In\r\nsouthern Indiana and Illinois, which is the best part of its range,\r\ntrees have attained a height of 140 feet and a diameter of six. The\r\naverage size of forest-grown specimens is seventy-five feet in height,\r\nand two or more in diameter.\r\n\r\nThe leaves are seven or eight inches long, doubly compound; the fruit a\r\npod a foot or more in length, which assumes a twist when ripe, or\r\nsometimes warps several ways. The green pod contains a sweet substance\r\noften eaten by children, but it is believed to be of little value for\r\nhuman food. Cattle devour the pods when in the sugary condition; but\r\nthey cannot often obtain them, because thorns intervene, when the pods\r\nwould otherwise be in reach. In rural districts, a domestic beer is\r\nbrewed from the young fruit. The juice extracted from it is permitted to\r\nferment, but the beverage is probably never sold in the market.\r\n\r\nThe pods are in no hurry to let go and fall, even after they are fully\r\nripe. They become dry, distort themselves with a number of corkscrew\r\ntwists, and hang until late fall or early winter, rattling in the wind\r\nand occasionally shaking out a seed or two.\r\n\r\nHoney locust has never been considered important from the lumberman’s\r\nstandpoint. Sawlogs go to mills here and there, but never many in one\r\nplace. The wood is not listed under its own name, but is put in with\r\nsomething else. Occasionally, it is said, it passes as sycamore in the\r\nfurniture factory, though the difference ought not be difficult to\r\ndetect. It doubtless depends to a considerable degree on the particular\r\nwood, for all honey locust does not look alike when converted into\r\nlumber. Some of that in the lower Mississippi valley might pass as\r\nsycamore if inspection is not too conscientiously carried out. The\r\nmedullary rays, being darker than the body of the wood, suggest sycamore\r\nin quarter-sawed stock. Some of it goes into furniture, finish,\r\nbalusters, newel posts, panels, and molding, particularly in eastern\r\nTexas. In Louisiana, where wood of similar texture and appearance might\r\nbe expected, it is not looked on with favor, but is employed only in the\r\ncheapest, roughest work.\r\n\r\nThe principal use of the wood is for posts and railroad ties. It lasts\r\nwell, and is strong. Claims have been made that it is generally equal\r\nand in some ways superior to locust. It is difficult to see on what\r\nthese claims are based. It is lighter, less elastic, and much weaker.\r\nFigures showing the comparative durability of the two woods are not\r\navailable, but in like situations, locust would doubtless last much\r\nlonger. As timber trees, the former may have the advantage over locust\r\nin being free from attacks of borers, attaining greater size, and\r\nthriving in a much larger area. It has been planted for ornament in\r\nother lands than this, and is now prospering in all the important\r\ncountries of the temperate zone. One variety is thornless, and is known\r\nto botanists as _Gleditsia triacanthos lævis_; another has short thorns.\r\n\r\n    WATER LOCUST (_Gleditsia aquatica_) looks so much like honey locust\r\n    that the two are often supposed to be the same species in Louisiana;\r\n    yet there are a number of differences. Water locust has fewer thorns\r\n    and they are smaller, and often flat like a knife blade. The pods\r\n    are entirely different from those of honey locust, being short and\r\n    wide. The two species share the same range to some extent, but that\r\n    of water locust is smaller, extending from South Carolina to Texas,\r\n    Illinois, and Missouri; but the best of the species is west of the\r\n    lower Mississippi where trees may reach a height of sixty feet and a\r\n    diameter of two. The wood is heavy, hard, and strong, the heartwood\r\n    rich bright brown, tinged with red, the sapwood yellow. The wood is\r\n    much like that of honey locust, and when used at all is employed in\r\n    the same way.\r\n\r\n    TEXAS LOCUST (_Gleditsia texana_) is of no importance as a timber\r\n    tree, and deserves mention only because its extremely restricted\r\n    range gives it an interest. It exists, as far as known, in a single\r\n    grove on the bottom lands of the Brazos river, near Brazoria, Texas,\r\n    where some of the trees exceed 100 feet in height, and a diameter of\r\n    two. The bark is smooth and thin, the leaves resemble those of honey\r\n    locust, and the pods are about one-third as long.\r\n\r\n    HUISACHE (_Acacia farnesiana_) is native along the Rio Grande in\r\n    Texas, but it is running wild in Florida from planted trees. It is\r\n    one of the most widely distributed species in the world, both by\r\n    natural dispersal and by planting; and it is one of the handsomest\r\n    members of the large group of acacias which includes more than 400\r\n    species. It bears delicate double-compound leaves, small and\r\n    graceful. A tree in full leaf in its native wilds along the Rio\r\n    Grande looks like a trembling fluffy mass of green silk. Nature\r\n    formed the tree for ornament, not for timber. It attains a height of\r\n    from twenty to forty feet, diameter eighteen inches or less. Trunk\r\n    usually divides into several branches near the ground. Perhaps the\r\n    only place in this country where the wood is used is in southern\r\n    Texas where is it called “cassie,” a shortening of acacia. The wood\r\n    so much resembles mesquite that locally they are considered the\r\n    same. Huisache warps and checks in seasoning, but it is employed in\r\n    a small way for furniture, usually as small table legs, spindles,\r\n    knobs, and ornaments. It takes high polish, and resembles the best\r\n    grades of black walnut, but is much heavier, harder, and stronger.\r\n    It is next to impossible to drive a nail into it without first\r\n    boring a hole. When used as crossties, holes must be bored for the\r\n    spikes. The heartwood resists decay a long time, but the thin\r\n    sapwood is liable to be riddled by small boring insects, which\r\n    seldom or never enter the heartwood.\r\n\r\n    TEXAS CAT’S CLAW (_Acacia wrightii_) is a hardluck tree of western\r\n    Texas where it is usually found on dry, gravelly hills and in stony\r\n    ravines. Its twice-compound leaves are among the smallest of the\r\n    acacias, seldom exceeding two inches in length. The fragrant, light\r\n    yellow flowers appear from March to May, and the short pods ripen in\r\n    midsummer, but like so many trees of the pea family, they are in no\r\n    hurry to fall. The largest trees are thirty feet high and one in\r\n    diameter, but most people associate cat’s claw with low, tangled\r\n    brush, tough as wire, and armed with curved thorns so strong that\r\n    their hold on clothing can hardly be broken. When a cat’s claw bush\r\n    strikes out to become a tree--which is infrequent--it grows rapidly.\r\n    It has been known to attain a diameter of nine inches in\r\n    twenty-three years. The heart is dark in color and exceedingly hard.\r\n    The color varies from nearly red to nearly black, and takes a polish\r\n    almost like ivory. The thin yellow sapwood is preyed on by boring\r\n    insects. Heartwood is made into canes, umbrella sticks, tool\r\n    handles, rulers, and turned novelties.\r\n\r\n    DEVIL’S CLAW (_Acacia greggii_) has such paradoxical names as\r\n    paradise flower, ramshorn, and cat’s claw. It deserves them all\r\n    where it grows wild on the semi-deserts of the Southwest from Texas\r\n    to California. The double-compound leaves are one or two inches\r\n    long, its bright, creamy-yellow and exquisitely fragrant flowers are\r\n    the glory of desert places, while its masses of thorns readily\r\n    suggest the common name by which it is known. The wood is scarce,\r\n    but extraordinarily fine. It is dark rich red, but clouded with\r\n    streaks and patches of other shades, becoming at times gray, at\r\n    others green. No nail can be driven into it, and an ordinary gimlet\r\n    will hardly bore it. It is so saturated with oil that it is greasy\r\n    to the touch. It is manufactured into small articles, but apparently\r\n    is not used outside of the locality where it grows. The wood is\r\n    often contorted, due to pits and cavities which slowly close as the\r\n    tree advances in age. They add to rather than detract from the\r\n    wood’s beauty.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOFFEE TREE\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COFFEE TREE]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOFFEETREE\r\n\r\n(_Gymnocladus Dioicus_)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis tree is scarce though its range covers several hundred thousand\r\nsquare miles, from New York to Minnesota, and from Tennessee to\r\nOklahoma. It never occurs in thick stands, and usually the trees are\r\nwidely scattered. Many districts of large size within the limits of its\r\nrange appear to have none.\r\n\r\nThe names coffeetree and Kentucky coffeetree refer to the custom of the\r\npioneers, who settled the region south of the Ohio river, and who used\r\nthe grotesque fruit as a substitute for coffee at a time when the\r\ngenuine article could not be procured. The seed is a very hard bean that\r\ncan be procured in abundance, where trees abound.\r\n\r\nThe beans were softened by roasting or parching, and were then pounded\r\ninto meal with hammers, and boiled for coffee. The beverage was black\r\nand bitter, and a little of it would go a long way with a modern coffee\r\ndrinker. When the Kentuckians were able to procure coffee they let the\r\nwild substitute alone.\r\n\r\nThe name was sometimes varied by calling it coffeenut or coffeenut tree,\r\nand sometimes it was known as coffeebean and coffeebean tree. It is less\r\neasy to explain why it was called mahogany in New York, and virgilia in\r\nTennessee. Some knew it as the nicker tree, but the reason for the name\r\nis not known. Stump tree was another of its names. This was meant to be\r\ndescriptive of the tree’s appearance after it had shed its leaves. It\r\nhas remarkable foliage, double compound leaves two or three feet long,\r\nwith four or five dozen leaflets. When leaves fall in autumn it looks as\r\nif the tree is shedding its twigs; and when all are down, the stripped\r\nand barren appearance of the branches suggests the name stump tree.\r\n\r\nThe flowers are greenish-purple and are inconspicuous. In this respect\r\nthey differ from many trees of the pea family which are noted for their\r\nattractive bloom. The fruit is among the largest of the tree pods of\r\nthis country, ranging in length from six to ten inches and from one and\r\na half to two in width. When fully grown they are heavy enough to make\r\ntheir presence felt if they drop on the heads of persons beneath. They\r\nare slow to fall, however, and it is not unusual for them to cling to\r\nthe branches until late winter or early spring.\r\n\r\nThe coffeetree has been known to attain a diameter of five feet and a\r\nheight of more than a hundred, but the usual size is about half of that.\r\nIt prefers rich bottom lands, and the trunks generally separate into\r\nseveral stems a few feet above the ground. Only one species exists in\r\nthis country, and as far as known, only one other species elsewhere, and\r\nthat grows in southern China where it is said the natives make soap of\r\nthe pods. It is not known that any such utilization has been attempted\r\nin this country.\r\n\r\nThe coffeetree’s range has been considerably extended by planting for\r\nornament. In summer it is attractive, but from the first autumn frost\r\nuntil the leaves put out the following spring, it is uninteresting. The\r\nspring leaves are late, and the branches are bare more than half the\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nThe wood is heavy, strong, and durable in contact with the soil. The\r\nheart is rich light brown, tinged with red, the sapwood thin and lighter\r\ncolored. Annual rings are distinct. The springwood is porous and wide,\r\nthe summerwood dense. The medullary rays are inconspicuous and of no\r\nvalue in giving figure to the wood. When the annual rings are cut\r\ndiagonally across they give figure like that of ash. The wood of the\r\ncoffeetree has never been in much demand. Furniture makers may use it\r\nsometimes, but specific instances of such use do not exist in\r\nmanufacturers’ reports. There are many places in furniture and finish\r\nwhich it might fill in a satisfactory manner.\r\n\r\nIt is suitable for fence posts, and that is where it commonly gives\r\nservice. It is occasionally employed as frame work in house and barn\r\nbuilding, but is not sought for that purpose, and is used only when it\r\nhappens to be at hand. Though the tree has the habit of branching, some\r\nof the trunks grow tall and shapely, and are good for two or three\r\nsawlogs or railcuts. An occasional tree serves as fuel. Medicine is\r\nsometimes made of a decoction of the fresh green pulp of unripe pods;\r\nand the leaves are reported to produce a fly poison if soaked in water.\r\n\r\nREDBUD (_Cercis canadensis_) is also known as Judas tree, red Judas\r\ntree, Canadian Judas tree, and salad tree. The last name refers to a\r\ncustom in some parts of its range of making salad of the flowers. It is\r\nthe flower rather than the bud that is red and gives the tree its name,\r\nthe bloom being conspicuous in early spring. The tree ranges from New\r\nJersey to Missouri, Texas, Louisiana, and Florida, but reaches its\r\nfullest development in southern Arkansas, Oklahoma, and eastern Texas\r\nwhere trunks fifty feet high and a foot in diameter are found. It is\r\nshrubby in many parts of its range. Leaves are not compound. The fruit\r\nis a pink or rose-colored pod two or three inches in length, and by some\r\nis considered nearly as ornamental though not as showy as the flowers.\r\nNo one ever thinks of redbud as a timber tree or considers its wood, yet\r\nit might be used for a number of purposes. It is heavy and hard, but\r\nweak; and the heartwood is rich dark brown tinged with red. The tree is\r\nplanted for ornament in this country and Europe.\r\n\r\nTEXAS REDBUD (_Cercis reniformis_) differs somewhat from the common\r\nredbud, but it takes a botanist to point out the differences. The\r\nlargest trees are forty feet high and a foot in diameter; the range\r\nextends from eastern Texas into Mexico; the wood closely resembles that\r\nof the other species, and is not known to be used for any purpose.\r\n\r\nCALIFORNIA REDBUD (_Cercis occidentalis_) is often classed as a shrub,\r\nbut Sudworth gives it a place among the forest trees of the Pacific\r\ncoast. The pea-shaped flowers are a clear magenta color. The pods turn\r\npurple when ripening but afterwards change to russet-brown. The wood is\r\ndark yellowish-brown, but because of the smallness of the trunks, it can\r\nnever be important. The tree is found along the California mountains,\r\nsix hundred miles north and south; is an abundant seeder, and is\r\nvaluable as a protection to slopes and ravines, and as an ornament.\r\n\r\nHORSEBEAN (_Parkinsonia aculeata_) is generally called retama in the\r\nvalley of the lower Rio Grande in Texas where the species attains its\r\nlargest size. Trees are occasionally thirty feet high and a foot or more\r\nin diameter. Trunks usually separate in several stems near the ground.\r\nThe range extends from southern Texas to California, and the species is\r\nnaturalized in south Florida, the West Indies, and many tropical\r\ncountries. Leaves vary in form, and are occasionally eighteen inches\r\nlong. Fruit consists of pods, each containing from two to eight beans.\r\nThe yellow flowers are small and fragrant; the bark on young twigs is\r\ngreen, but on older trunks is brown. The brown, however, is easily\r\nrubbed off, exposing the green beneath, as may be seen in school grounds\r\nin some of the southern towns in Texas where this tree has been planted\r\nfor ornament, and abrasions, due to children climbing about the\r\nspreading stems, keep the bark green. The upper branches are armed with\r\nthorns which discourage the climbing propensities of children. The wood\r\nis heavy, hard, tinged with yellow, and is made into small novelties,\r\nbut is not of much importance.\r\n\r\nSMALL-LEAF HORSEBEAN (_Parkinsonia microphylla_) is well named, for the\r\ncompound leaves, with four or six pairs of leaflets, are about an inch\r\nlong, covered with hairs, and fall at the end of a few weeks.\r\nConsequently, the tree is bare most of the year, except for the pale\r\nyellow flowers which appear in spring before the leaves, and the\r\nclusters of striped pods, each containing from one to three beans. The\r\npods are nearly always present, for they have the pea family habit of\r\nadhering to the branches a long time. Trees reach a height of fifteen or\r\ntwenty feet, and a diameter of ten inches or less. The wood is very hard\r\nand dense, in color deep yellowish-brown, often mottled and streaked\r\nwith dull red; the sapwood thick and yellow. The wood is suitable for\r\nsmall articles, but its scarcity renders it of little importance. It is\r\nfound in the deserts of southern Arizona and the adjacent parts of\r\nCalifornia, and is usually a small shrub.\r\n\r\nJAMAICA DOGWOOD (_Ichthyomethia piscipula_) is the lone representative\r\nof the genus, and is found in this country only in southern Florida. It\r\nis not in the same family with the dogwoods, and its name is misleading.\r\nThe Carib Indians formerly used the leaves to stupify fish and render\r\nthem easier to catch; hence the botanical name. The leaves are compound,\r\nbut bear little resemblance to the foliage of most members of the pea\r\nfamily to which this tree belongs. The flowers are the tree’s chief\r\nsource of beauty, and are delicately clustered, hanging in bunches a\r\nfoot long. The fruit is a pod three or four inches long, with four wings\r\nrunning the full length. The wings are useless for flying. Trees are\r\nforty or fifty feet high and two or three feet in diameter; are common\r\nin southern Florida and on the islands. The wood is of considerable\r\nimportance in the region where it grows but figures little in general\r\nmarkets. It weighs 54.43 pounds per cubic foot, and is moderately strong\r\nand stiff. In color it is a clear yellow-brown, with thick, lighter\r\ncolored sapwood. It is very durable in contact with the ground, and in\r\nFlorida it is used for posts, and occasionally for railway ties. It has\r\nbeen commonly reported as a wood for boatbuilding in Florida, but its\r\nimportance for that purpose has probably been overstated, since an\r\ninvestigation of the boatbuilding industry in Florida failed to find one\r\nfoot of this wood in use, although some may be employed but not listed\r\nin reports.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYELLOW-WOOD\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Yellow-wood]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYELLOW-WOOD\r\n\r\n(_Cladrastis Lutea_)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis wood’s color is evidently responsible for its names yellow ash,\r\nyellow locust, and yellow-wood in Tennessee, North Carolina, and\r\nKentucky, but no reason is offered for the name gopherwood by which it\r\nis known in some parts of Tennessee. The botanical name is based on the\r\nbrittleness of the twigs. It is the only species of the genus, and it is\r\nnot known to grow anywhere, except by planting, outside of Kentucky,\r\nTennessee, Alabama, and North Carolina.\r\n\r\nIt occurs in an area not much exceeding 60,000 square miles, and it is\r\nnot abundant in that area. It prefers limestone ridges and slopes, and\r\ndoes best where the soil is fertile. It often overhangs the banks of\r\nmountain streams, and is most abundant and of largest size in the\r\nvicinity of Nashville, Tennessee, where a few trees have reached a\r\ndiameter of three or four feet and a height of fifty or sixty. A\r\ndiameter of eighteen or twenty-four inches is a good average.\r\n\r\nThe tree’s habit of dividing six or seven feet from the ground into two\r\nor more stems is responsible for the scarcity of trunks suitable for saw\r\ntimber, even in localities where trees of large size are found. However,\r\nan occasional trunk develops a shapely form. It goes to sawmills so\r\nseldom that it is never mentioned in statistics of lumber cut or\r\nwood-utilization.\r\n\r\nMost people who are acquainted with this tree, know it as planted stock\r\nin parks and yards where it is a favorite on account of its flowers. The\r\nbloom may properly be described as rare from two viewpoints. The beauty\r\nof its large clusters of white flowers differs from those of all\r\nassociated trees; and it seldom blooms. One year of plenty is generally\r\nfollowed by several lean years. Those who plant the tree understand\r\nthis, and feel amply repaid for the long wait, when the flowering year\r\narrives. The planted tree is often known as virgilia, that being the\r\nname under which nurseries sell it. Flowers appear about the middle of\r\nJune, in clusters a foot or more in length. It is claimed, but with what\r\ncorrectness cannot at present be stated, that the odor of flowers of\r\ndifferent trees varies greatly, being faint with some, and strong and\r\nluxurious with others.\r\n\r\nThe leaves are compound, but have no resemblance to those of locust and\r\nthe acacias. They are eight or twelve inches long, with five or seven\r\nleaflets. In autumn before falling they change to a clear yellow, but\r\nadhere to the branches until rather late in the season. The fruit, which\r\nconsists of small pods hanging in clusters, is ripe in September.\r\n\r\nYellow-wood is a little below white oak in strength and seven pounds per\r\ncubic foot under it in weight; is hard, compact, and susceptible of a\r\nbeautiful polish. Rings of yearly growth are clearly marked by rows of\r\nopen ducts, and contain many evenly-distributed smaller ducts. The wood\r\nis bright, clear yellow, changing to brown on exposure; sapwood nearly\r\nwhite. Trunks of largest size are generally hollow or otherwise\r\ndefective.\r\n\r\nThe uses of yellow-wood have been few. In the days when families in\r\nremote regions were under the necessity of manufacturing, growing, or\r\notherwise producing nearly every commodity that entered into daily life,\r\nthe settlers among the mountains of Kentucky and Tennessee discovered\r\nthat the wood of this tree, particularly the roots, yielded a clear,\r\nyellow dye. The process of manufacture was simple. The wood was reduced\r\nto chips with an ordinary ax, and the chips were boiled until the yellow\r\ncoloring matter was extracted. The resulting liquor was the dye, and it\r\ngave the yellow stripe to many a piece of home-made cloth in the cabins\r\nof mountaineers.\r\n\r\nThe women usually attended to the dye making and the manufacture of yarn\r\nand cloth; but the men found a way to utilize yellow-wood in producing\r\nan article once so common in Tennessee and Kentucky that no cabin was\r\nwithout it--the trusty rifle. The gunsmith, assisted by the blacksmith,\r\nmade the barrel and the other metal parts, but the hunter generally was\r\nable to whittle out the wooden stock. Yellow-wood’s lightness, strength,\r\nand color suited the gun stock maker’s purpose, and he slowly hewed and\r\nwhittled the article, fitted it to the barrel, adjusted it to his\r\nshoulder, and completed a weapon which never failed the owner in time of\r\nneed.\r\n\r\nFRIJOLITO (_Sophora secundiflora_) is found in Texas, New Mexico, and\r\nsouthward in Mexico. The name is Spanish and means “little bean.” A\r\ncommon name for it in English is coral bean. Sophora is said to be an\r\nArabic word of uncertain meaning, except that it refers to some kind of\r\na tree that bears pods. It is a species, therefore, which draws its\r\nnames from four languages, while the name applied to it by Comanche\r\nIndians is translated “sleep-bush.” The bright scarlet seeds, as large\r\nas beans, but in shape like door-knobs, grow from one to eight in a pod,\r\nand contain a narcotic poison, “sophorin.” It is probable that Indians\r\ndiscovered that the beans, if eaten, produced sleep, hence the name. The\r\ntree is from twenty-five to thirty-five feet high, and from six to ten\r\ninches in diameter. The leaves are compound, and consist of seven or\r\nnine leaflets. The small, violet-blue flowers appear in early spring.\r\nThey are not conspicuous, but their presence cannot escape the notice of\r\na traveler in the dry, semi-barren canyons and on the bluffs where the\r\ntree holds its ground. Their odor calls attention to their presence. The\r\nperfume is powerful but pleasant, unless the contact is too close. The\r\npods are from one to seven inches long, and hang on the boughs until\r\nlate winter. It is not believed that birds or mammals distribute the\r\nseeds, as their poison renders them unfit for food. Running water\r\nappears to be the principal agent of distribution. The tree reaches its\r\nlargest size in the vicinity of Metagorda bay, Texas. Among the dry\r\nwestern canyons it is usually a shrub. The small size of this tree\r\nstands in the way of extensive use of the wood. It burns well and its\r\nprincipal importance is as fuel. The weight is 61.34 pounds per cubic\r\nfoot; it is hard, compact, susceptible of a beautiful polish; medullary\r\nrays are numerous and thin; color is orange, streaked with red, the\r\nsapwood brown or yellow. The wood is worked into a few small articles.\r\n\r\nSOPHORA (_Sophora affinis_) ranges through portions of Arkansas and\r\nTexas. It is popularly supposed to be a locust, and is called pink\r\nlocust or beaded locust, the first name based on the color of the wood,\r\nthe last on the appearance of the pod which looks like a short string of\r\nbeads, sometimes three inches in length, but usually shorter. In early\r\ntimes the pioneers manufactured ink from the pods. It was a fairly\r\nserviceable article, but was never sold, each family making its own.\r\nThis tree’s flowers appear in early spring with the leaves. Trunks reach\r\na height of twenty feet and a diameter of eight or ten inches; but the\r\nhabit of separating into several stems a few feet above the ground\r\nlessens the use of the wood, even as posts, for the stems are usually\r\nvery crooked. The tree’s preferred habitat is on limestone bluffs, or\r\nalong the borders of streams, or in depressions in the prairie where\r\nsmall groves often occur. The wood weighs fifty-three pounds per cubic\r\nfoot, and is very hard and strong. The annual rings are clearly marked\r\nwith bands of large, open pores; medullary rays are thin and\r\ninconspicuous; color of the heartwood light red, the sapwood yellow. The\r\nwood is not sawed into lumber, but is whittled into canes and tool\r\nhandles.\r\n\r\nGREENBARK ACACIA (_Cercidium floridum_) is properly named. Its green\r\nbark makes up for its scarcity of leaves, and answers the purpose of\r\nfoliage. The manufacture of the tree’s food goes on in the bark, because\r\nthe leaves are too small to do the work. The foliage resembles that of\r\nlocust and acacia in form, but the compound leaves are about an inch in\r\nlength, and the leaflets are one-sixteenth of an inch long. Flowers are\r\nsmall, but the tree puts on three or four crops of them in a single\r\nsummer. The pods are two inches long. The tree is found in the United\r\nStates only in the south and west of Texas, where it is occasionally\r\ncalled palo verde. It attains a height of twenty feet and a diameter of\r\nten inches when at its best. The wood is pale yellow tinged with green,\r\nand, because of small size, is of little importance.\r\n\r\nPALO VERDE (_Cercidium torreyanum_) sheds its leaves and its pods so\r\nearly in the season that its branches are bare most of the year. Trees\r\nare from fifteen to thirty feet high, and some are considerably more\r\nthan a foot in diameter. Its range covers a portion of southern\r\nCalifornia, the lower part of the Gila valley in Arizona, and extends\r\nsouthward into Mexico. It is a typical tree of the desert, and its\r\nextreme poverty of foliage enables it to live in a dry, hot climate. It\r\nclings to the sides of desert gulches and canyons, ekes out a dreary\r\nlife in depressions among desolate dunes and hills of sand and gravel,\r\nand spends its allotted period of years in solitude, growing either\r\nsingly or in small groups where the full foliage at the best time of\r\nyear is insufficient to offer much obstruction to the full glare of the\r\nsun from a cloudless sky. The small flowers have little beauty or\r\nsweetness, but what they have is wasted on the desert air. Wayfarers in\r\nthe barren country use the wood for camp fires.\r\n\r\n    INDIGO THORN (_Dalea spinosa_) receives its name from the color of\r\n    its flowers which appear in June. The tree has few leaves and they\r\n    fall in a short time. This appears to be a provision of nature to\r\n    enable the tree to endure the heat and dryness of its desert home.\r\n    Its range covers the lower Gila valley in Arizona, and extends into\r\n    the Colorado desert in southern California. It is not abundant, and\r\n    if it were, it is of a size so small that it is practically\r\n    valueless for commercial purposes. Some trees are a foot in diameter\r\n    and twenty feet high. The wood is light, soft, and of a rich\r\n    chocolate-brown color. It is known also as indigo bush and dalea.\r\n\r\n    EYSENHARDTIA (_Eysenhardtia orthocarpa_) is so little known that it\r\n    has no English name. It grows from western Texas to southern\r\n    Arizona, but reaches tree size only near the summit of Santa\r\n    Catalina mountains in Arizona where it is twenty feet or less in\r\n    height and seldom more than eight inches in diameter. It inhabits an\r\n    arid region, and bears fruit sparingly, with usually a single seed\r\n    in a pod. The wood is heavy and hard, light reddish-brown in color,\r\n    with thin yellow sap. It is not of commercial importance and\r\n    probably never will be.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESQUITE\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MESQUITE]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESQUITE\r\n\r\n(_Prosopis Juliflora_)\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are known to be sixteen species at least of mesquite in the world,\r\nin Asia, Africa, and North and South America. The one here considered\r\nhas a geographical range of at least seven thousand miles north and\r\nsouth, from Kansas to Patagonia, and an east and west range of four\r\nthousand miles, if the naturalized growth in Hawaii may be considered\r\nthe western outpost of the species.[7]\r\n\r\n    [7] Botanists have had much controversy among themselves concerning\r\n    mesquite, particularly as to what is its correct name. In giving in\r\n    these pages some of the important facts concerning this interesting\r\n    tree, or group of species and varieties, it is not necessary to\r\n    touch the points in dispute.\r\n\r\nThe generic name _prosopis_ is a Greek word meaning “burdock;” the rest\r\nof the botanical name is Latin, meaning “July flower.” Mesquite is an\r\nAztec word (mezquitl), coming down through the Spanish. Other names for\r\nthe tree are algaroba, honey locust, honey pod, and ironwood.\r\n\r\nThe largest size of mesquite is found along the Rio Grande in southern\r\nTexas where trees three feet in diameter and fifty feet high are found,\r\nbut individuals of that size are rare. The species is supposed not to\r\nextend west of New Mexico, but varieties grow farther west.\r\n\r\nThe leaves are compound, with twenty or more leaflets. The foliage is\r\nthin and casts a penumbrous shadow; trees generally occur wide apart,\r\nand there is enough sunshine reaching the ground to satisfy grass and\r\nother plants growing there. The pods are from four to nine inches long,\r\nand each contains from ten to twenty seeds. The principal growth of this\r\ntree in the United States is in Texas. It has been planted in Hawaii and\r\nhas run wild in some of the islands of the group. It is of slow growth,\r\nbut of remarkable vitality, holds its own, and gains ground in the face\r\nof obstacles.\r\n\r\nPersons well acquainted with conditions in Texas, both past and present,\r\nsay that the mesquite area is at least double now what it was when the\r\nstate came into the Union. Old stands were scattered here and there, but\r\nhundreds of square miles which were in grass only, and little of that,\r\nhalf a century ago, now support forests of mesquite. It is perhaps a\r\nmisnomer to designate some of these stands as forests, for they present\r\na rather ragged and sorry appearance, but they are forests in the\r\nprocess of forming. The old growth, which is found principally in the\r\ncounties bordering on the lower Rio Grande, is made up of trunks of\r\nlarge size, but the stands that have come on within the past fifty or\r\nsixty years are of smaller trees. A large mesquite trunk is from one to\r\nthree feet in diameter; a small one from one foot down to an inch or\r\ntwo. A person would need to hunt from center to circumference of Texas\r\nto find many mesquite trunks that would make a straight sawlog twelve\r\nfeet long. The tree is generally one of the most crooked, deformed and\r\nunpromising in the whole country; and its habit of dividing into forks\r\nnear the ground, like a peach tree, makes it still more difficult to\r\nmake use of. In fact, in winter when mesquite trees are bare of leaves\r\nthe appearance of a forest reminds the observer of an old, neglected,\r\ndiseased, moss-grown peach orchard in the eastern states; but in summer\r\nthe leaves conceal much of the trunk scaliness and deformity, and there\r\nis something positively restful and attractive in the prospect of a wide\r\nrange of these trees, covering hills and prairies. The leaves are\r\ncompound like the acacias, and are delicate and graceful.\r\n\r\nThe spread of mesquite in the last fifty or seventy-five years has been\r\nattributed to the checking of grass fires which Indians once set yearly\r\nto keep the prairies open. The dispersion of the trees is facilitated by\r\nthe scattering of seeds by cattle which feed on the pods. It is a tree\r\nhard to kill. Roots send up sprouts year after year during long periods.\r\nSometimes, but not often in Texas, when adverse circumstances become so\r\nsevere that the mesquite tree can no longer survive above the surface,\r\nit grows beneath the ground, sending only a few sprouts up for air. “Dig\r\nfor wood” is a term applied to trees of that kind, when fuel is dragged\r\nout with mattocks, grab hooks, and oxen.\r\n\r\nThe roots of the mesquite penetrate farther beneath the surface for\r\nwater than any other known tree in this country. Depths of fifty or\r\nsixty feet are occasionally reached. Well diggers on the frontiers\r\nlearned to go to the mesquite for water. Large trunks never develop\r\nunless their roots are abundantly supplied with moisture. Railroad\r\nengineers on the “Staked Plains” of northwestern Texas turned that\r\nknowledge to account in boring wells.\r\n\r\nThough mesquite is seldom or never mentioned in the lumber business, it\r\nis and has been one of the most important trees of the region. Its fuel\r\nvalue is very great. It has cooked more food, warmed more buildings,\r\nburned more bricks, than any other wood in Texas. The tannic acid in it\r\ninjures boilers and it is not much used for steam purposes. It is very\r\nhigh in ash. A cord of mesquite wood when burned leaves from ninety to\r\none hundred pounds of ashes. This exceeds five fold the ashes left when\r\nwhite oak is burned.\r\n\r\nMesquite is a high-grade furniture material, though it is difficult to\r\nwork because of its exceeding hardness. Ordinary wood-working tools and\r\nmachinery will not stand it. Suites of nine pieces are sold in some\r\nsouthwestern cities at $200 or $300. The merchants find difficulty in\r\ngetting mesquite furniture made. Factories do not want to handle it,\r\nthough the articles sell higher than mahogany. Large, heavy tables,\r\ndeeply carved, are sold in some of the cities, but all seem to be made\r\nto order and largely by hand. The appearance of the polished and\r\nfinished wood is a little lighter in color than mahogany. It is not\r\nuniform in color, but shades from tone to tone in the same piece. A\r\nlittle of the lighter colored sapwood is worked in with pleasing effect.\r\nSome of the tones resemble black walnut, and some suggest the luster of\r\npolished cherry.\r\n\r\nMesquite is brittle. Pieces of large size may be broken by a few blows\r\nwith an ax. It has about half the strength of white oak, and is very low\r\nin elasticity. The wood has been used for two hundred years--possibly\r\nfor thousands of years--as beams and sills for adobe houses; but it is\r\nnot required to carry much weight. Spaniards employed it in building\r\ntheir churches and forts within its range. A timber taken from the\r\nAlamo, at San Antonio, Texas, in 1912, was said to have served more than\r\n190 years with no sign of decay. Fence posts survive the men who set\r\nthem. Paving blocks outlast sandstone subjected to the same use.\r\nRailroads in southern Texas employ this wood for crossties, but it is so\r\nhard that holes must be bored for the spikes.\r\n\r\nMesquite baskets are made by hand of splits the size of knitting\r\nneedles, some of white sapwood, others of dark heartwood. Such baskets,\r\nlarge enough to contain five quarts, sell in the curio shops at San\r\nAntonio for $1.25 each. Some wagon makers insist that mesquite is in the\r\nsame class with Osage orange for wagon felloes in hot, dry regions; but\r\nit does not appear that much of it is so used. The brittleness of the\r\nwood is against it, in use as felloes, except for vehicles of the\r\nheaviest sort where large pieces are demanded.\r\n\r\nAmong the uses of mesquite, by-products are an important consideration.\r\nThe pods are food for farm stock. Before the first railroad reached San\r\nAntonio mesquite pods were a regular market commodity. The Mexicans know\r\nhow to make bread and brew beer from the fruit; tan leather with the\r\nresin; dye leather, cloth, and crockery with the tree’s sap; make ropes\r\nand baskets of the bark. Parched pods are a substitute for coffee; bees\r\nstore honey from the bloom which remains two months on the trees; riled\r\nwater is purified with a decoction of mesquite chips; vinegar is made\r\nfrom the fermented juice of the legumes; tomales of mesquite bean meal,\r\npepper, chicken, and cornshucks; mucilage from the gum; and candy and\r\ngum drops from the dried sap.\r\n\r\nOne of the most promising uses for this wood is in turnery. Short\r\nlengths can be utilized to advantage. The artistic color fits it for the\r\nmanufacture of lodge gavels, curtain rings, goblets, plaques, trays,\r\nand numerous kinds of novelties. Spindles for grills and stairways do\r\nnot suffer in comparison with black walnut, mahogany, cherry, and teak.\r\nThe wood is porous, annual rings narrow and indistinct, and the\r\nmedullary rays thin and inconspicuous.\r\n\r\nA variety (_Prosopis juliflora glandulosa_) is found from Kansas to\r\neastern Texas, and also in Arizona and California. It is the common\r\nmesquite of eastern Texas. Another variety (_Prosopis juliflora\r\nvelutina_) occurs in some of the hot valleys of southern Arizona and\r\nsouthward in Mexico.\r\n\r\n    SCREWBEAN (_Prosopis odorata_) is known also as screwpod mesquite,\r\n    and tornillo. The name is due to the pod’s habit of growing in\r\n    spiral form, there being a dozen or more tight twists. The flowers\r\n    appear in early spring and new crops follow until summer. The pods\r\n    ripen early in autumn or late in summer, and many become infested\r\n    with grubs. The tree is from twenty-five to thirty feet high, and a\r\n    foot or less in diameter. Its range extends from western Texas and\r\n    Utah and Nevada through New Mexico and Arizona to southern\r\n    California. The wood is stronger and stiffer than common mesquite,\r\n    but a little lighter. Its uses are much the same, and it has the\r\n    same habits of growth, including its disposition to develop enormous\r\n    roots. The name might lead to the conclusion that the flower is rich\r\n    in perfume, but such is not the case. The tree grows slowly and\r\n    lives to old age, if it escapes fire and other accidents.\r\n\r\n    CHALKY LEUCÆNA (_Leucæna pulverulenta_), commonly called mimosa,\r\n    occurs in the United States only in southern Texas, but is somewhat\r\n    abundant in Mexico, where trees sixty feet high and nearly two feet\r\n    in diameter are sometimes manufactured into lumber. Along the Rio\r\n    Grande it is called “tepeguaja” by Mexicans. This name is said to be\r\n    equivalent to “hardwood,” which is an appropriate name. It is very\r\n    smooth and handsome when finished, and is used for tool handles,\r\n    small spindles, grills, and other small articles, particularly\r\n    products of the lathe. In color it resembles the lighter shades of\r\n    mahogany; weighs about forty-two pounds per cubic foot; foliage\r\n    extremely delicate and the tree is highly valuable for ornamental\r\n    purposes. It has been planted outside of its natural range. The pods\r\n    sometimes exceed a foot in length.\r\n\r\n    LEUCÆNA (_Leucæna glauca_) is small and probably will never be of\r\n    much importance. Trunks are seldom more than five inches in diameter\r\n    and twenty feet high. The tree grows in canyons and ravines in\r\n    western Texas. The compound leaves are six or seven inches long,\r\n    with thirty or less pairs of leaflets; fruit is a pod six or eight\r\n    inches long. The rich brown wood is streaked with red.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSWEET BIRCH\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SWEET BIRCH]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSWEET BIRCH\r\n\r\n(_Betula Lenta_)\r\n\r\n\r\nTen species of birch occur in the United States, including Alaska. Six\r\nare eastern and four western.[8] Sweet birch is known by that name in\r\nmany localities, but in others as black birch, cherry birch, river\r\nbirch, mahogany birch, and mountain mahogany. Its range extends from\r\nNewfoundland to northwestern Ontario, south to southern Indiana,\r\nKentucky, and along the Appalachian mountains to Tennessee and North\r\nCarolina. Probably the best development of the species is found in the\r\nAdirondack region of northern New York, in the northern peninsula of\r\nMichigan, through southern Ontario, and along the mountain ranges\r\nsouthward through Pennsylvania and West Virginia.\r\n\r\n    [8] The eastern species, which do not extend west of the continental\r\n    divide, are, Sweet Birch (_Betula lenta_), Yellow Birch (_Betula\r\n    lutea_), River Birch (_Betula nigra_), Paper Birch (_Betula\r\n    papyrifera_), White Birch (_Betula populifolia_) and Blue Birch\r\n    (_Betula cærulea_). The western birches, none of which are known to\r\n    extend much east of the continental divide, are: Western Birch\r\n    (_Betula occidentalis_), Mountain Birch (_Betula fontinalis_), White\r\n    Alaska Birch (_Betula alaskana_), and Kenai Birch (_Betula\r\n    kenaica_). The last two occur in Alaska, but not in United States\r\n    proper.\r\n\r\nIt attains a height of seventy or eighty feet, and a diameter of two or\r\nthree. It prefers deep, moist, rich soil, but will grow in comparatively\r\ndry, rocky ground. Its seeds are produced in large numbers and are\r\nscattered by the wind a hundred feet or more from the parent tree. They\r\nlack the wing power and the buoyancy of the seeds of some of the other\r\nbirches, but they manage to get themselves sown in sufficient numbers,\r\nand their powers of germination are good.\r\n\r\nThe young seedling comes into existence with smooth bark, but it does\r\nnot keep it through life. As age increases, the bark becomes rough and\r\nblack. It is not shed in papery rolls and flakes as is the bark of river\r\nbirch, yellow birch, and paper birch, with which it is associated in\r\nsome parts of its range. It is generally an easy tree to identify and\r\nthe black, rough bark is generally a sufficient guide.\r\n\r\nThe sweet birch is tapped like sugar maple, but not for the same purpose\r\nor to the same extent--only an occasional tree. Immense quantities of\r\nsap will flow from it during the two or three weeks when the buds are\r\nswelling in the spring. It is said that as much as two tons has been\r\nknown to flow from a medium sized birch in a single season. The sap is\r\nmade into a beer which has some commercial value, but is chiefly used\r\nlocally. One of the ways of making it, employed by farmers and woodsmen,\r\nis to jug the sap, put in a handful of shelled corn, and let\r\nfermentation do the rest.\r\n\r\nA substance known in commerce as oil of wintergreen is procured almost\r\nexclusively from this birch, though occasionally it is made from the\r\nsmall wintergreen plant (_Gaultheria procumbens_). The product is\r\nmanufactured in very crude stills made by mountaineers in Pennsylvania\r\nand southward along the mountains where sweet birch is abundant.\r\nFrequently the woodsman’s whole family go into the business, chopping\r\ndown birch bushes and hacking them with hatchets into chips of the\r\ndesired sizes. The oil is extracted from the hogged mass by a steaming\r\nand roasting process. It is sold by the quart to country storekeepers\r\nwho ship it to wholesale druggists where it is refined and used to\r\nflavor candy, medicine, and drugs. The woodsman who manufactures the oil\r\nprefers young birches from half an inch to two or three inches in\r\ndiameter, and he usually procures them in old logging grounds where\r\nseedlings have sprung up. It is said that on an average one hundred\r\nsmall birch trees are destroyed for each quart of oil that goes to\r\nmarket. It is a process wasteful in the extreme.\r\n\r\nIn the open ground, sweet birch develops a full crown, short trunk,\r\nabundance of limbs, with numerous slender, graceful twigs and small\r\nbranches. Its leaves form a dense mass, and they are so free from\r\nattacks by insects and worms that diseased foliage is unusual. That\r\ncannot be said, however, of the trunk. It is not particularly liable to\r\ndisease, but many old trees show the results of decay. It is of slow\r\ngrowth, and a small tree may be much older than its size indicates. The\r\nsapwood is generally thick, heartwood forms slowly, and the contrast in\r\ncolor between sap and heart is strong.\r\n\r\nThe wood of sweet birch had few uses in early times, except fuel. The\r\npioneer sawmill had little to do with it. Lumber was hard to saw and was\r\nseasoned with difficulty. Its tendency to warp was too great a tax on\r\nthe lumberman’s patience and ingenuity. The only way he could hold it\r\nstraight was to cob a few layers in the bottom of a pile, and stack\r\nthousands of feet of other lumber on top, and leave it a year or two.\r\nThat was generally too much trouble, particularly when the wood had slow\r\nsale, and the price was low. Birch reached market in large quantities\r\nonly when modern mills and improved drykilns came into existence.\r\n\r\nThe wood is heavy, strong, hard, in color dark brown tinged with red.\r\nThe light brown or yellow sapwood generally makes up seventy or eighty\r\nannual rings. The difference between springwood and that of the later\r\nseason is not clearly marked, and consequently the rings are often\r\nindistinct. The wood is very porous, and the pores are diffused through\r\nall parts of the ring. They are too small to be seen with the naked eye,\r\nexcept under the most favorable conditions. The medullary rays are\r\nnumerous but so small that they appear on the quartered wood merely as a\r\ngloss, which, however, gives the surface a rich appearance.\r\n\r\nForms known as curly and wavy birch are highly esteemed. They are\r\naccidents of growth, well developed in birch, and occurring in several\r\nother woods. Difficulties are encountered in assigning sweet birch its\r\nindividual place in the industrial world. As a tree it is well known,\r\nbut that is not the case when its lumber goes to market. The sweet birch\r\nlog goes into the sawmill, but when the lumber goes out at the other end\r\nof the mill, it is often simply birch having lost the adjective “sweet”\r\nsomewhere in the operation. The reason is that sweet birch and yellow\r\nbirch, quite distinct in the forest, are often mixed and become one, to\r\nall intents and purposes, when they reach the market. That is not always\r\nthe case, but it frequently is. Something depends on the region. The\r\nyellow birch’s range is more extensive, and in areas where it is\r\nabundant, and sweet birch is not, it prevails in the lumber markets. But\r\nsouth and southeast of the great lakes, as well as in the northeastern\r\npart of the country, the two species mingle, and they are apt to go to\r\nmarket simply as birch. The woods may be distinguished by a microscopic\r\nexamination, but the ordinary observer would make many mistakes if he\r\nattempted to tell one from the other in the lumber yard.\r\n\r\nThe two woods are different in several physical properties. Both are\r\nheavy, but sweet birch weighs 47.47 pounds per cubic foot, while yellow\r\nbirch weighs only 40.84 pounds, according to tests averaged by Sargent.\r\nYellow birch rates a little above the other in breaking strength. Both\r\nare very stiff, but yellow birch rates superior. In most respects the\r\ntwo woods are put to similar uses--flooring, interior finish,\r\nfurniture--but for some purposes sweet birch is preferred. It is\r\nsubstituted oftener for cherry and mahogany, and for that reason is\r\nknown as cherry birch or mahogany birch. Its color makes the\r\nsubstitution easy, and the appearance of the grain, with a little\r\ndoctoring with stains and fillers, helps in the deception. The buyer may\r\nbe deceived as to the exact kind of wood he is getting, but he is not\r\ncheated in the quality. Birch is substituted where strength is required,\r\nas in the rails of beds, the frames of sofas, davenports, large chairs,\r\nand certain parts of large musical instruments. It is much stronger, and\r\nfully as hard as cherry or mahogany, and as its appearance is so much\r\nlike them, the article is actually better on account of the\r\nsubstitution. Sweet birch is largely employed for various parts of\r\nvehicle manufacture, particularly for wagon hubs and frames of\r\nautomobiles. It is also much used in the manufacture of sleds, boats,\r\nand handles.\r\n\r\nThe demand is heavy and the supply is diminishing. The tree is of such\r\nslow growth that few timber owners will be inclined to wait for a second\r\ncrop, after the old trees have been cut, since 150 years are necessary\r\nunder forest conditions to produce a merchantable tree.\r\n\r\n    SONORA IRONWOOD (_Olneya tesota_) is a desert tree, and the only\r\n    representative of the genus. It takes its name from the Mexican\r\n    state where it is most abundant and where it was discovered in 1852.\r\n    It grows in southern California and Arizona, and there it thrives in\r\n    gulches and depressions in the desert, frequently associated with\r\n    mesquite. It is so heavy that perfectly dry wood will sink in water.\r\n    The heartwood is deep chocolate-brown, mottled with red, the thin\r\n    sapwood is lemon-yellow. Its hardness renders it difficult to work,\r\n    and it can scarcely be split. The wood is made into canes and other\r\n    small articles of great beauty. It is not abundant, and the small\r\n    supply is remote from manufacturing centers; otherwise it would be\r\n    more valuable. It is excellent fuel, but it is burned chiefly by\r\n    stockmen and miners in their camps. The largest trees are thirty\r\n    feet high and eighteen inches in diameter. It is an evergreen, and\r\n    its pea-like flowers brighten many a remote desert place.\r\n\r\n    WILD TAMARIND (_Lysiloma latisiliqua_) is forty or fifty feet high,\r\n    two or three in diameter, grows in southern Florida, and has\r\n    double-compound leaves, four or five inches long. The fruit is a pod\r\n    one inch wide and five or less in length. The wood weighs forty\r\n    pounds to the cubic foot, is neither strong nor tough, very low in\r\n    elasticity, is rich dark brown tinged with red, the sapwood white.\r\n    It has been reported for boatbuilding, and claims have been made\r\n    that it is equal to mahogany for that purpose, but the claim is of\r\n    doubtful validity, in view of the rather poor showing it makes in\r\n    several physical properties, though it takes good polish.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYELLOW BIRCH\r\n\r\n[Illustration: YELLOW BIRCH]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYELLOW BIRCH\r\n\r\n(_Betula Lutea_)\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is little likelihood of mistaking the yellow birch for any other\r\nas it stands in the woods. Its points of individuality may be discovered\r\non slight acquaintance, and there is little need of studying leaves,\r\nflowers, and fruit to find ways of distinguishing this birch from other\r\nmembers of the family. Its tattered, yellow and gray bark fixes it in\r\nthe memory of all who have seen it a few times. Two other eastern\r\nbirches have tattered, curling bark also, but they do not look like\r\nthis. They are the paper birch and the river birch. The former is too\r\nwhite to be mistaken for yellow birch, and the river birch is too much\r\nthe color of bronze or copper. Yellow birch is named from the color of\r\nits bark, the part which shows when the outer layers break and roll\r\nback, disclosing the fresh, smooth, satiny layers below. Sometimes the\r\ntree is called silver birch, gray birch, or swamp birch.\r\n\r\nIts geographic range is bounded by a line drawn from Newfoundland to\r\nnorthern Minnesota, southward through the Lake States, and along the\r\nAtlantic coast to Delaware. It follows the Appalachian ranges of\r\nmountains to eastern Tennessee and western North Carolina. Generally the\r\ntree is small near the southern limit of its range. The best grows in\r\nMichigan and Wisconsin, but it is of considerable importance in\r\nMinnesota.\r\n\r\nFew trees are better equipped than yellow birch to perpetuate their\r\nspecies. It is an abundant seeder, and the seeds are light, winged, and\r\nthey are scattered by wind over long distances. Sometimes they are\r\ncarried miles. Of course, most of them fall in unfavorable places, and\r\neither do not germinate or perish soon after; but they are not\r\nparticularly choice in situations, and will grow on bare mineral soil,\r\neven in old fields, where they are flooded with sunshine, or they will\r\ngrow in deep shade where a beam of sunlight seldom touches them. They\r\noften germinate without touching mineral soil, and take root quickly and\r\ngrow vigorously.\r\n\r\nIt is not unusual in the northern part of the tree’s range, and on high\r\nmountains farther south, to see yellow birches standing on high,\r\nspreading roots, two, three, or four feet above the ground. That\r\npeculiar attitude is brought about by the manner in which the seed\r\nbegins to grow. It falls on moss which occupies the top of a log or a\r\nstump. The moss in the deep shade retains much moisture, and the seed\r\ngerminates, grows, sends roots down the sides of the log or the stump\r\nuntil they strike mineral soil, and become firmly fixed. In course of\r\ntime the log or stump decays, and the spreading roots continue to\r\nsustain the trunk, high above the ground. This attitude of the yellow\r\nbirch tree is very common in damp woods. Occasionally the seed finds\r\nlodgment in the moss on top of a large rock. The roots descend the sides\r\nuntil they reach the ground, and as the rock does not decay, the tree\r\ngrows to maturity on the rock. The most favorable seed bed for this\r\nspecies is a mass of rotten wood where a log has decayed and fallen to\r\npieces. Frequently such a plot is covered with yellow birch seedlings.\r\nThey have the space all to themselves, because the seeds of few trees or\r\nplants will grow in rotten wood, unmixed with mineral soil.\r\n\r\nThe trunk of yellow birch averages a little smaller than that of sweet\r\nbirch, but may equal it in some instances. Trees reach a height of 100\r\nfeet and a diameter of three or four, but a more common size, even in\r\nthe regions of best development, is a height of sixty or seventy feet,\r\nand a diameter of two or less.\r\n\r\nYellow birch was a long time coming into use. One of the first things\r\nlearned about it by early settlers in the region where it was abundant,\r\nwas that it decays quickly in situations alternately wet and dry. That\r\nprejudiced the woodsmen against it, and they were not disposed to give\r\nit a fair trial, as long as there was plenty of other timber. All\r\nbirches are subject to quick decay, if conditions are right to produce\r\nit. Yellow birch in the woods sometimes dies standing, and when that\r\nhappens, the wood falls to pieces so quickly that the bark may remain\r\nstanding with very little inside of it except powder of decayed wood.\r\nThis tree is seldom mentioned in early accounts of lumber operations,\r\nand practically never with a good word. Operators generally left it\r\nstanding when they cut the timber which grew with it.\r\n\r\nYellow birch is heavy, very strong, hard, light brown tinged with red,\r\nwith thin, nearly white sapwood. The color of the heartwood varies\r\nconsiderably. The pores are very numerous, rather small, and are\r\nscattered through the wood with little tendency to run in bands or\r\ngroups. The springwood blends gradually with the summerwood in a way to\r\nmake the boundaries of the annual rings somewhat indistinct. Medullary\r\nrays are numerous, but very thin and obscure. Quarter-sawing adds little\r\nor nothing to the appearance of the wood. It has poor figure, except an\r\noccasional tree with wavy or curly grain, or with burls.\r\n\r\nThe wood may be readily stained. The pores hold the coloring matter\r\napplied, and by varying the application, the appearance of the surface\r\ncan be varied. The colors of mahogany and of cherry are easily imparted,\r\nand yellow birch often imitates those woods.\r\n\r\nVehicle makers choose this wood for its strength and elasticity. In the\r\nNorth it is manufactured into frames for cutters and sleighs of all\r\nkinds. It is a competitor of sugar maple for that purpose. Hubs are made\r\nof it for horse-drawn vehicles, and its hardness gives long wear where\r\nthe spokes are inserted. That is one of the first points of failure when\r\na soft, inferior wood is used for hubs. The spokes work loose.\r\n\r\nManufacturers of automobiles have tried out yellow birch as material for\r\nframes; it has stood the test, and is much used in competition with\r\nother woods. The amount demanded for that purpose is not necessarily\r\nlarge, but it must be the best wood that can be had.\r\n\r\nThis material reaches the markets in all grades. Large amounts are used\r\nfor packing boxes, crates, and shipping containers. Low grades answer\r\nfor these purposes, leaving the better sorts for the more exacting\r\nindustries. The logs are cut in rotary veneer for baskets, and for ply\r\nwork. Some of the veneer in three-ply is worked into commodities of high\r\nclass, such as seats and backs of theater chairs.\r\n\r\nBirch flooring competes closely with maple for popular favor. It may\r\nlack something of maple’s whiteness, but it takes no second place in\r\nhardness, smoothness, and wearing qualities. It is made into parquet\r\nflooring as well as the ordinary tongued and grooved article. As such,\r\nthe sap matches the light colored woods, and the heart the dark.\r\n\r\nIt goes into all kinds of interior house finish, from floor to ceiling,\r\nand the finest grades are often devoted to stair work. Door and window\r\nframes are made of it in large quantities, but it is not suited to\r\noutside work exposed to weather, because of its tendencies to decay. It\r\nis much employed as door material. Furniture demands the same class of\r\nwood. Medium priced articles may be of solid birch, but the best\r\ncommodities are made of veneers laid upon other woods. Figured birch is\r\na favorite material for that class of work.\r\n\r\nThe more common commodities manufactured of this wood can be listed only\r\nby groups, because of their great number. Novelties constitute a large\r\nclass. One of the earliest demands was from the manufacturers of pill\r\nboxes, such as apothecaries use. That was before anyone had tried to\r\nsell yellow birch in the general market, and the demand came principally\r\nfrom New England and New York. Another early demand came from coopers\r\nwho found that barrel hoops of yellow birch were highly satisfactory for\r\ncertain kinds of vessels. Fish kits were among the first to appear in\r\nbirch hoops. Small saplings were used, not over two inches in diameter.\r\nThey are large enough to make two hoops by splitting. The bark was left\r\non, and the identity of the wood was never in doubt, because when the\r\nsapling is of that size, the bark is a fine yellow. It has not yet\r\ncommenced to crack open and roll up, as it does later. Millions of birch\r\nhoops are still produced yearly in the United States, but all of them\r\nare not of this species. The hoop business has existed much more than a\r\ncentury, and millions of young birches have been cut every year to meet\r\nthe demand.\r\n\r\nBirch broom handles have been a commodity since the first lathe went to\r\nwork on that product. They are made of all the commercial birches, but\r\nyellow birch contributes a large part. Other handles are manufactured of\r\nit also, such as are fitted to hand saws, planes, drawing knives,\r\nchisels, and augers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRIVER BIRCH\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RIVER BIRCH]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRIVER BIRCH\r\n\r\n(_Betula Nigra_)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis tree is known as red birch, river birch, water birch, blue birch,\r\nblack birch, and simply as birch. The name red birch refers to the color\r\nof the bark which is exposed to view in the process of exfoliation. The\r\ntrunk is constantly getting rid of its outer bark, and in doing so, the\r\nexterior layers are rolled back, hang a while, and are gradually whipped\r\noff by the wind. The new bark which is exposed to view when the old is\r\nrolled back is reddish. Its color varies considerably, sometimes\r\nsuggesting the tint of old brass, again it is brown, but people in\r\nwidely separated regions have seen fit to call the tree red birch\r\nbecause of the color of its bark. The name black birch is not\r\nappropriate, though the old bark near the base of large trunks may\r\nsuggest it. No reason can be assigned for calling it blue birch, unless\r\nthe foliage in early summer may warrant such a term. River birch and\r\nwater birch are more appropriate, as these names indicate the situations\r\nwhere the species grows. It clings to water courses almost as closely as\r\nsycamore. A favorite attitude of the tree is to lean over a river or\r\npond, with the long, graceful limbs almost touching the water.\r\n\r\nNature seems to recognize the tree’s habit of hanging over muddy banks,\r\nand has prepared it for that manner of life. Seeds are ripe early in\r\nsummer when the rivers are falling. They are scattered by myriads on the\r\nmuddy shores and upon the water. Those which fall in the mud find at\r\nonce a suitable place for germination, and those whose fortune it is to\r\ndrop in the water float away with the current or they are driven by the\r\nwind until they lodge along the shores, and the receding water leaves\r\nthem in a few days, and they spring up quickly. Before the autumn or\r\nearly winter high water comes, they are well rooted in the mud and sand,\r\nready to put up a fight for their lives.\r\n\r\nThe provision is a wise one. If the seeds matured in the fall, when\r\nwater is low, they would be strewn along the low shores, and before they\r\ncould take root and establish themselves, the high water and the ice of\r\nwinter would destroy them. The seeds need mud to give them a start in\r\nlife, and they need that start early in summer.\r\n\r\nThe range of river birch is less extensive than that of the other\r\nimportant eastern birches, yet it is by no means limited. Its eastern\r\nboundary is in Massachusetts, its western in Minnesota, and it adheres\r\nfairly well to a line drawn between the two states. Its range extends\r\n200 miles west of the Mississippi and covers most of the southern\r\nstates. It is found in an area of nearly 1,000,000 square miles, but is\r\nscarce in most of it. In certain restricted localities it is fairly\r\nabundant, but there are thousands of square miles in the limits of its\r\nrange which have not a single tree. Its greatest development is in the\r\nsouth Atlantic states, and in the lower Mississippi basin.\r\n\r\nTrees at their best are from eighty to ninety feet high and from two to\r\nfour in diameter, but most trunks are less than two feet in diameter.\r\nThe tree frequently forks fifteen or twenty feet from the ground, or\r\noccasionally sends up several stems from the ground. Forms of that kind\r\nare practically useless for lumber.\r\n\r\nThe wood is among the lightest of the birches and weighs 35.91 pounds\r\nper cubic foot. It is rather hard, medium strong, the heartwood light\r\nbrown in color, with thick, pale sapwood. It rates below sweet and\r\nyellow birch in stiffness, is very porous, but the pores are quite\r\nsmall, and can scarcely be seen without a magnifying glass. They are\r\ndiffused throughout the entire annual ring. There is no marked\r\ndifference in the appearance of the springwood and that of the late\r\nseason. The medullary rays are very small and have little effect on the\r\nappearance of the wood, no matter in what way the sawing is done.\r\n\r\nThe wood is apt to contain pith flecks and streaks. These are small,\r\nbrown spots or lines scattered at random through the wood. They are a\r\nblemish which is not easily covered up if the wood is to be polished;\r\nbut they are small and may not be objectionable. The flecks are caused\r\nby insects which, early in the season, bore through the bark into the\r\ncambium layer (the newly-formed wood), where eggs are deposited. The\r\nyoung insect cuts a tunnel up or down along the cambium layer, an inch\r\nor less in length and a sixteenth of an inch wide. This gallery\r\nsubsequently fills with brown deposits which remain permanently in the\r\nwood. Sometimes these deposits are sufficiently hard to turn the edge of\r\ntools.\r\n\r\nRiver birch is widely used but in small amounts. It may properly be\r\ndescribed as a neighborhood wood--that is, wherever it grows in\r\nconsiderable quantity it is put to use, but nearly always in a local\r\nway. For example, in Louisiana, where it is as abundant as in any other\r\nstate, it is a favorite material for ox yokes, and no report from that\r\nstate has been made of its employment for any other purpose. The reason\r\ngiven for its extensive use for ox yokes there is that it is very strong\r\nfor its weight, and that it resists decay. The yokes there are usually\r\nleft out of doors when not in use, and the dampness and hot weather\r\ncause rapid decay of most woods. The birches are usually listed as\r\nquick-decaying woods, but the verdict from Louisiana seems to be that\r\nriver birch is an exception.\r\n\r\nPlain furniture is made of it, and the manufacturers of woodenware find\r\nit suitable for most of their commodities. It is sometimes listed as\r\nwooden shoe material, but no particular instance has been reported where\r\nit has been so used in this country. In Maryland some of the\r\nmanufacturers of peach baskets make bands or hoops of it, and pronounce\r\nit as satisfactory for that purpose as elm.\r\n\r\nThe supply is not in much danger of exhaustion. The species is equipped\r\nto take care of itself, occupying as it does, ground not in demand for\r\nfarming purposes. When a tree once gets a start it has a chance to\r\nescape the ax until large enough for use.\r\n\r\nWHITE ALASKA BIRCH (_Betula alaskana_) is usually called simply white\r\nbirch where it grows. It is not exclusively an Alaska species though\r\nthat is the only place where it touches the territory of the United\r\nStates. It is supposed by some to be closely related to the white\r\nbirches of northern Asia, but the relationship, if it exists, has not\r\nbeen established. In Alaska it grows as far north as any timber extends.\r\nIt was first discovered and reported in 1858 on the Saskatchewan river,\r\neast of the Rocky Mountains, and its range is now known to extend down\r\nthe valley of the Mackenzie river toward the Arctic ocean to a point\r\nmore than 100 miles north of the Arctic circle. It is common in many\r\nparts of Alaska both along the coast and in the interior. In some\r\nportions of that territory it is an important source of fuel. Trees are\r\nfrom twenty-five to sixty feet high, and from six to eighteen inches in\r\ndiameter. The bark is thin and often nearly white, separating into thin\r\nscales. The tree bears typical birch cones, but larger than those of\r\nsome of the other species. No tests of the wood’s physical properties\r\nhave been made, but it looks like the wood of paper birch, and will\r\nprobably attain to considerable importance in the future, since it grows\r\nover a large area, and in many parts is abundant. There remain many\r\nthings for both botanists and wood-users to investigate concerning this\r\ntree which has a range of more than half a million square miles.\r\n\r\nWESTERN BIRCH (_Betula occidentalis_) is believed to be the largest\r\nbirch in the world, and yet it is not of much commercial importance in\r\nthe United States, because of scarcity, occurring only in northwestern\r\nWashington and in the adjacent parts of British Columbia, as far as its\r\nrange has been determined. It resembles paper birch, and has often been\r\nsupposed to be that tree. The people in the restricted region where it\r\ngrows speak of it simply as birch. The largest trees are 100 feet high\r\nand four feet in diameter, clear of limbs forty or fifty feet. A height\r\nof seventy feet and a diameter of two are common. The general color of\r\nthe trunk is orange-brown, the new bark, exposed by exfoliation, is\r\nyellow. The tree prefers the border of streams and the shores of lakes.\r\nThough it is the largest of the birches, its seeds are among the\r\nsmallest. They are provided with two wings and are good flyers.\r\nManufacturers of flooring and interior finish in Washington reported the\r\nuse of 315,000 feet of this birch in 1911. That was the only use found\r\nfor it in the only state where it grows. Information is meager as to the\r\nprobable quantity of this birch available. It has been reported in\r\nIdaho, but exact information on the subject is lacking.\r\n\r\n    MOUNTAIN BIRCH (_Betula fontanalis_) is a minor species concerning\r\n    which there has been much contention among botanists. It has finally\r\n    been called mountain birch because it grows on mountains, as high as\r\n    10,000 feet among the Sierra Nevadas in California. It has many\r\n    local names for a tree so small as to be almost a shrub throughout\r\n    most of its range: Black birch, sweet birch, cherry birch, water\r\n    birch, and canyon birch. Its bark is of the color of old copper;\r\n    wood is light yellowish-brown, with thick white sapwood; trunks\r\n    seldom exceed ten inches in diameter and thirty feet high; range\r\n    extends from northern British Columbia to California, and along the\r\n    Rocky Mountains to Colorado and possibly further south. The uses of\r\n    the wood are few.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPAPER BIRCH\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PAPER BIRCH]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPAPER BIRCH\r\n\r\n(_Betula Papyrifera_)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis tree is called paper birch because the bark parts in thin sheets\r\nlike paper. It is known as canoe birch from the fact that Indians and\r\nearly white explorers and travelers constructed canoes of the bark. The\r\nname silver birch is an allusion to the color of the bark; and big white\r\nbirch is the name used when the purpose is to distinguish it from the\r\nwhite birch with which it is associated in the northeastern part of its\r\nrange. It grows as far north as Arctic British America, east to\r\nLabrador, south to Michigan and Pennsylvania, and west nearly or quite\r\nto the base of the Rocky Mountains. This indicated area exceeds\r\n1,000,000 square miles. The quantity of birch of this species in the\r\nforests is unknown, but it runs into billions of feet, probably\r\nexceeding any other single species of birch. The tree sometimes grows\r\ndispersed through forests of other woods, sometimes in nearly pure\r\nstands. Persons well acquainted with the species have expressed the\r\nopinion that paper birch exists in larger quantities now than at the\r\ntime when the country was first explored by white men. That can be said\r\nof few other species; but probably holds true of lodgepole pine in the\r\nWest, loblolly pine in the Southeast, and mesquite in the Southwest.\r\nEach of these species took advantage of man’s presence and influence to\r\nextend its range. Cattle spread the mesquite; the lodgepole pine came up\r\nin fire-burned tracts; loblolly pine spread into abandoned fields; and\r\npaper birch profited by fires which destroyed large tracts of timber.\r\n\r\nThe seeds are light, are furnished with wings which sail them long\r\ndistances through the air, and they are quickly scattered over the\r\nburned areas where they spring up. In the contest, they are competitors\r\nof aspen. Birch often captures the ground, but does not always do it.\r\nSome of the largest stands in the Northeast occupy tracts bared by fire\r\nhalf a century or more ago. When paper birch does not find open tracts,\r\nit contents itself with sharing ground with other species. That was the\r\nusual manner of its growth in the original forests; but it has been\r\nquick to seize opportunities to take full possession.\r\n\r\nIt does not like shade and, if crowded, one of the first things it does\r\nis to rid its lower trunk of all branches. Only limbs remain which are\r\nat the top where they receive plenty of light. Therefore, forest-grown\r\npaper birches have long, clean trunks, though they are not always\r\nstraight. The largest trees are seventy feet high and three in diameter,\r\nbut those fifty feet in height and eighteen inches in diameter are above\r\nrather than under the average.\r\n\r\nThe bark of paper birch has played an important part in American\r\nhistory, story, and poetry. It was the canoe material, the roof, and the\r\nutensil in its region. The Indians had brought the art of canoe making\r\nto perfection before white men went among them. The bark peels from the\r\ntrunks in large pieces, and may be separated into thin sheets, which are\r\nvery tough, strong, and durable. The Indians sewed pieces of bark\r\ntogether, using the long, slender roots of tamarack for thread. The bark\r\nwas stretched and tied over a frame, the shape of the canoe, and made of\r\nnorthern white cedar, or some other light wood. Holes in the bark, and\r\nthe partings at the seams, were stopped with resin from balsam fir, wax\r\nfrom balm of Gilead, or resin from pine. The forest supplied all the\r\nmaterial needed by the Indian, and a canoe thus made, and large enough\r\nto carry 800 or 1,000 pounds, weighed no more than fifty pounds. Frail\r\nas it seemed, it was good for long service on rivers and lakes, and\r\ncould weather storms of no small severity.\r\n\r\nWhite men adopted the bark canoes at once, and learned from Indians how\r\nto make them. The daring explorers and venturesome fur traders who\r\nthreaded every river and navigated every important lake of British\r\nAmerica, found the birch canoe equal to every requirement, even to\r\nattacking whales in the tidewater of the Arctic ocean. The bark from\r\nthis birch was used for tents and the roofs of cabins; vessels in which\r\nto store or carry food were made of it, as well as beds on which to\r\nsleep, and wrapping material for bundles. These uses have now\r\npractically ceased; but as sport, recreation, and for the novelty,\r\narticles, from canoes to visiting cards, are still made of the bark.\r\n\r\nThe wood of paper birch is valuable for certain purposes. The trees are\r\nlargely white sapwood, which is without figure. It is as plain a wood as\r\ngrows in the forest, but it may be stained. That, however, is seldom\r\ndone. The heartwood is dark or red, and is made into brush backs and\r\nparquet flooring, but the hearts are small, and no large quantity of\r\nthat wood is used. The largest use of paper birch is for spools, the\r\ncommon kind for thread. Some of larger size are made for use in mills.\r\nThe sapwood only is accepted by makers of spools. The heart is cut out,\r\nand most of it is thrown away or burned under the boilers. The qualities\r\nof paper birch which appeal to spool makers are, white color, small\r\nliability to warp, and the ease with which it may be cut without dulling\r\nthe tools. The logs are worked into bars of the various spool sizes, and\r\nare carefully seasoned. One of the problems that must be constantly\r\nsolved is the prevention of sap stain while the bars are seasoning. The\r\nwood discolors quickly and deeply.\r\n\r\nTooth picks, shoe pegs, and shoe shanks are other important commodities\r\nmanufactured from paper birch. It has not yet been satisfactorily\r\nconverted into lumber, because it is more valuable for spools, tooth\r\npicks, pegs, and the like. This wood is frequently listed as a pulpwood,\r\nand it is quite generally believed that its use for that purpose is\r\nimportant. This is apparently an error, as the wood is not even\r\nmentioned in statistics of pulpwood output in this country.\r\n\r\nPaper birch weighs 37.11 pounds per cubic foot, is strong, hard, tough;\r\nmedullary rays are numerous but very small and obscure; wood is\r\ndiffuse-porous, and earlywood blends gradually with latewood in the\r\nannual rings which are not very distinct.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the woods which does not threaten to become soon\r\nexhausted. A supply for half a century, at present rate of use, is in\r\nsight, if no more should grow; but in fifty years new forests, now\r\nyoung, will be large enough to use.\r\n\r\n    KENAI BIRCH (_Betula kenaica_) is an Alaska species concerning which\r\n    comparatively little is known, except that its botanical identity\r\n    and something of its range have been established. Its small size,\r\n    and the remote regions where it grows, do not necessarily indicate\r\n    that it can never be important. Scarcity of other woods may give it\r\n    a place which it does not now occupy. No reports on the properties\r\n    of the wood have been made. The bark is deep brown in color. Trees\r\n    are from twenty to thirty feet high and from twelve to eighteen\r\n    inches in diameter. The trunks are very short. Cones are an inch or\r\n    less in length and the double winged seeds are very small. The name\r\n    applied to this species relates to the region where the best\r\n    developed trees have been found. As far as known, the species is\r\n    confined to the coast region of Alaska and to adjacent islands from\r\n    the head of Lynn canal westward. It has been reported on Koyukuk\r\n    river above the Arctic circle.\r\n\r\n    WHITE BIRCH (_Betula populifolia_) is known also as gray birch,\r\n    old-field birch, poverty birch, poplar-leaved birch, and small white\r\n    birch. It is chiefly confined to the northeastern part of the United\r\n    States, but grows as far east as Nova Scotia, and west to the\r\n    southern shore of Lake Ontario. It occurs on the Atlantic coast\r\n    south to Delaware, and along mountain ranges to West Virginia. The\r\n    names describe either the habits or the appearance of the tree. The\r\n    bark is white, and is the most prominent feature of a thicket of\r\n    these graceful but practically worthless little birches. It is\r\n    called an old-field species because it quickly scatters its small,\r\n    winged seeds over abandoned farmland and takes possession when it\r\n    does not have to compete with stronger species. Poverty birch is an\r\n    allusion, either to the poor ground it occupies or the unpromising\r\n    nature of the tree itself. The resemblance of its leaves to those of\r\n    cottonwood leads some people to prefer the name poplar-leaved birch.\r\n    The tree at its best is seldom more than forty feet high and\r\n    eighteen inches in diameter. A height of twenty or thirty feet is\r\n    the usual size. The stem is generally clothed with branches nearly\r\n    to the ground. The wood is light, soft, not strong or durable, heart\r\n    light brown, thick sap nearly white. The form and size of the trunk\r\n    exclude it from sawmills, but it has some special uses: Spools, shoe\r\n    pegs, and hoops. Its small size does not disqualify it for service\r\n    along those lines. The tree springs up quickly, grows with fair\r\n    rapidity, and dies young. It is cut for cordwood in New England and\r\n    makes good fuel. It takes possession of areas bared by fire, and\r\n    protects the ground, furnishing shelter for more valuable species\r\n    which come later.\r\n\r\n    BLUE BIRCH (_Betula cærulea_) is a small tree of which more\r\n    information is to be desired. It is rarely more than thirty feet\r\n    high with a diameter of eight or ten inches. Its leaves are\r\n    long-pointed, its cones about an inch in length, the bark is thin,\r\n    white tinged with rose, and is lustrous. Bark is not easily\r\n    separated into layers, in that respect differing from the paper\r\n    birch. The inner bark is of light orange color. It is probably put\r\n    to no use, unless for fuel or as hoops. It is smallest of New\r\n    England birches, and its range has not been fully determined, but it\r\n    is known to grow in Maine and Vermont, and probably will be found in\r\n    other parts of New England and in the adjacent regions of Canada. It\r\n    has been compared with a European species of birch, the _Betula\r\n    pendula_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRED ALDER\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RED ALDER]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRED ALDER\r\n\r\n(_Alnus Oregona_)\r\n\r\n\r\nMany species of alder are found in various parts of the world, and on\r\nboth sides of the equator, but chiefly in the northern hemisphere. Some\r\nof these are trees, others are shrubs. Six species belonging in the tree\r\nclass grow in the United States, besides others which remain shrubs.\r\nSome trees are burdened with names, changing them with locality, but not\r\nso with alder. An adjective may accompany the name, as red, white,\r\nseaside, or mountain, to describe it, but it is always alder, no matter\r\nwhere it grows. The different species cover much of the United States,\r\nand few large areas are found which have not one or more species. It\r\ngrows from sea level up to 7,000 feet or more, but some species thrive\r\nat one elevation, and others above or below.\r\n\r\nThe alders are old inhabitants of the earth. They had a place in the\r\nEocene and Miocene forests of the old world and new. It is not apparent\r\nthat they have either gained or lost in extent of range during the\r\nhundreds of thousands of years which measure their tenancy on the earth.\r\nThey have not been aggressive in pushing their way, nor have they shown\r\na disposition to retire before the aggression of other trees. Some\r\nalders bear seeds equipped with wings for wind distribution, others\r\nproduce wingless seeds which depend on water to bear them to suitable\r\nsituations and plant them. Of course, the water-borne seeds are planted\r\non muddy shores or on the banks of running streams, and the trees of\r\nthose species are confined to such situations. The alders belong to the\r\nbirch family.\r\n\r\nRed alder is the largest of the alder group in this country. Mature\r\ntrees are from forty to ninety feet high, and from one to three feet in\r\ndiameter. The northern limit of its range crosses southern Alaska; its\r\nsouthern border is in southern California. It is a Pacific coast tree,\r\nwith a north and south range of 2,000 miles. Trunks are straight, and\r\nbranches are generally slender. The largest specimens grow in the\r\nvicinity of Puget Sound. The bark is thin, leaves are from three to ten\r\ninches long, cones from one-half to one inch in length, seeds have very\r\nnarrow, thin wings, and are about the size of radish seeds. The cones\r\nremain green in color until the seeds are fully ripe, but they finally\r\nturn brown, and seeds are liberated during the fall and winter.\r\n\r\nRed alder is given that name because the newly cut wood is liable to\r\nchange quickly to a reddish-brown. This applies to the whitish sapwood\r\nonly; but since the trunk is largely sapwood, it is an important matter.\r\nIt is not apparent whether the change in color is due to attack by\r\nfungi, or to some chemical change in the sap. It is not believed that\r\nthe change in color weakens the wood, at least it does not appear to do\r\nso immediately. The heart is reddish, and when dressed and polished, it\r\npresents a fine appearance.\r\n\r\nRed alder when thoroughly air dry weighs about thirty pounds per cubic\r\nfoot, which is slightly above the weight of basswood. It is strong for\r\nits weight, rating only eight per cent below white oak, while in\r\nstiffness or elasticity it is about twelve per cent above white oak. It\r\nis not difficult to season, is soft, stands well when made up, and is\r\none of the most important hardwoods of the northwest Pacific coast. More\r\nthan 2,000,000 feet a year go to wood-using factories in Washington and\r\nOregon.\r\n\r\nThe Indians of the Northwest, when they had only stone hatchets or the\r\ncrudest kinds of metal tools, found red alder a wood which worked so\r\neasily that they specialized with it. They made canoes of the largest\r\ntrunks, and all manner of troughs, trays, trenches, platters, and\r\ndugouts, some of no more than a pint in capacity, others holding three\r\nor four bushels. The Field Museum in Chicago has a collection of these\r\nIndian utensils made of alder. The workmanship shows considerable skill\r\nmixed with barbaric art. There are carvings of eagles and bears which\r\nare not entirely grotesque. The utensils were designed primarily to\r\ncontain food at ceremonial feasts, or it was stored for times of\r\nscarcity. Among them are cooking vessels of alder in which meat was\r\nboiled by filling the troughs with water and dropping in hot stones.\r\n\r\nFurniture manufacturers are the largest users of red alder. Carefully\r\nselected heartwood, finished in the proper color, looks much like\r\ncherry, though it lacks something of the characteristic cherry luster.\r\nThe sapwood in its natural color resembles the sapwood of yellow birch.\r\nThe annual rings are defined by narrow bands of dense summerwood. The\r\npores are small and diffused through the entire ring, as with birch.\r\nMedullary rays are very thin and do not show much figure; neither do the\r\nrings of growth, in tangential sawing, display much contrast. It is,\r\ntherefore, a figureless wood, entering into practically all grades of\r\nfurniture, in the region where alder is plentiful, but it shows to\r\nparticularly good advantage in panels.\r\n\r\nReports on wood-utilization on the Pacific coast list this wood for\r\narchery bows but particulars as to amount used, and why it is used at\r\nall, are not given. The physical properties of the wood do not seem to\r\nfit it for that use. It is wanting in both strength and elasticity which\r\nare the prime, almost the only, factors considered in selecting bow\r\nwood. No account has been found of any employment of alder for bows by\r\nIndians of the region where it grows.\r\n\r\nBroom handle turners in Washington use 350,000 feet of alder a year. The\r\nsmooth finish which may be imparted to the wood constitutes its chief\r\nvalue for broom handles. It is well liked for porch columns. When the\r\ncenter is bored out, the wood seldom checks. In that respect it\r\nresembles yellow poplar. It takes paint well and holds it a long time.\r\nComparatively large amounts are converted into interior finish. It is\r\nmade into spindles, newel posts, railing, panels, molding, ornaments,\r\nand pedestals. Occasionally it is finished in the wood’s natural color.\r\n\r\nMany minor places are found for red alder. Frames of pack saddles are\r\nmade of it; it forms parts of pulleys; is available for small turnery;\r\nand it is sometimes worked into bodies and compartments for business\r\nwagons, such as butchers and bakers use. The bark is rich in tannin and\r\nis said to be employed in local tanneries, but no statistics are\r\navailable showing the annual supply.\r\n\r\nWHITE ALDER (_Alnus rhombifolia_) is known simply as alder in the region\r\nwhere it grows. Where this tree and red alder occupy the same range they\r\nare commonly supposed to be the same. The range of white alder extends\r\nfrom northern Idaho to southern California. It is the common alder of\r\ncentral California where it attains its best development, and the only\r\nalder at low altitudes in southern California. Trees vary in height from\r\nthirty to eighty feet, and in diameter from one to three. A common size\r\nis fifty feet high and fifteen inches in diameter. Like most alders, it\r\nsticks close to water courses, and is usually found in the bottoms of\r\ngulches where water flows most of the year. The flowers begin to appear\r\nin midsummer as dark, olive-brown catkins less than an inch in length.\r\nBy midwinter they are fully developed, and the tree is loaded with\r\ncatkins from four to six inches long and thick as lead pencils. In the\r\ngulches among the elevated foothills it is not unusual for trees to be\r\nbending beneath snow and flowers at the same time. That is about the\r\nperiod when the seeds of the preceding year complete their dispersal.\r\nThe cones hang closed nearly a whole twelve months, and when they give\r\nup their seeds, they often do it slowly. The seeds are the size of pin\r\nheads, and seem to have had wings once, but lost them. The remnants\r\nremain, but are of no use. If running water does not carry seeds to new\r\ngrounds they lie beneath the parent tree. The wood of white alder is\r\nfive pounds lighter per cubic foot than red alder. Its structure is less\r\nsatisfactory. Medullary rays are irregular, some being thin as those of\r\nsweet birch, while others are as broad as rays of chestnut oak. Those of\r\nlarge size seem to be scattered at haphazard, and are so irregular and\r\nuncertain that no dependence can be placed in them for figure. Trees are\r\nlargely sapwood, which is nearly white when freshly cut, but it quickly\r\nturns brown; heartwood is pale, yellowish-brown. This is said to be one\r\nof most quickly-decaying woods of the western forests when logs are left\r\nlying in damp woods. The white alder ought to be suitable for nearly\r\nevery purpose for which red alder is used.\r\n\r\n    MOUNTAIN ALDER (_Alnus tenuifolia_) is too small to contribute much\r\n    to the lumber supply of the country, though it may yield fuel in\r\n    some localities where there is little else. Its range extends from\r\n    Yukon territory to Lower California, a distance of 4,000 miles, and\r\n    it nearly touches both the torrid and frigid zones. It is found from\r\n    the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific in the United States. Few trunks\r\n    exceed twenty-five feet in height or six inches in diameter; but the\r\n    form is generally brush, in tangled thickets along the courses of\r\n    mountain streams, and on boggy slopes, up to 7,000 feet in altitude.\r\n    The wood is light brown, and there are no reports showing its use\r\n    for any purpose except firewood.\r\n\r\n    SITKA ALDER (_Alnus sitchensis_) is one of the smallest of the\r\n    arborescent species, and in most instances it is a shrub a few feet\r\n    high. At its best it is thirty feet high and eight inches in\r\n    diameter. It grows from Alaska to Oregon, and eastward to Alberta\r\n    and Montana. It is found in mountain regions 4,000 feet above the\r\n    sea. The wood is valuable for fuel only. This species was discovered\r\n    about eighty years ago, but was practically lost sight of until\r\n    recently. Many persons saw it but supposed it to be one of the other\r\n    alders.\r\n\r\n    LANCELEAF ALDER (_Alnus acuminata_) is a southwestern species,\r\n    ranging through southern New Mexico and southern Arizona and south\r\n    4,000 miles to Peru. In the United States it ascends to altitudes of\r\n    4,000 or 6,000 feet where it fringes the banks of streams, and\r\n    flourishes in the bottoms of canyons. The largest trees are thirty\r\n    feet high and eight inches in diameter. Flowers open in February\r\n    before the appearance of the leaves. The seeds have small wings\r\n    which are of little or no use.\r\n\r\n    SEASIDE ALDER (_Alnus maritima_) grows in Maryland, Delaware, and\r\n    Oklahoma, and the largest trunks are thirty feet high and five\r\n    inches in diameter. It is found on the banks of ponds and streams.\r\n    The flowers appear in July, and the seeds of last year’s crop ripen\r\n    at the same time. The wood is light, soft, and brown, heart and sap\r\n    being scarcely distinguishable. The wood is not used.\r\n\r\n    The European Alder (_Alnus glutinosa_) has been naturalized in a few\r\n    places in the United States, and several varieties are distinguished\r\n    in cultivation. A native shrubby species (_Alnus rugosa_) is common\r\n    in many parts of the eastern states. It is not usually listed as a\r\n    tree, being too small, but it is sometimes twenty-five feet high and\r\n    three or four inches in diameter. In Europe the charcoal made from\r\n    alder is considered excellent material for the manufacture of gun\r\n    powder, and considerable areas of alder in England are held in\r\n    reserve against an emergency. It is probable that the American\r\n    alders would answer as well as the European species.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHORNBEAM\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HORNBEAM]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHORNBEAM\r\n\r\n(_Ostrya Virginiana_)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis tree belongs to the birch family and is closely related to the\r\nalders and to blue beech. Four species of hornbeam are known in the\r\nworld, and two of them are in the United States. One is well known to\r\nmost persons who are familiar with eastern hardwood forests, but the\r\nother is seldom seen because of the limited extent of its range.\r\n\r\nThe well-known hornbeam is found in the valley of the St. Lawrence\r\nriver, throughout Nova Scotia and Ottawa, along the northern shore of\r\nLake Huron to northern Minnesota, south through the northern states and\r\nalong the Alleghany mountains to the Chattahoochee region of western\r\nFlorida; through eastern Iowa, southeastern Missouri and Arkansas,\r\neastern Kansas, Oklahoma and the Trinity river region of Texas. It is\r\nknown as ironwood, hop-hornbeam, leverwood, and hardhack.\r\n\r\nThe Indians were small users of wood except for fuel, but they had\r\nplaces where they put wood to special uses. They chose hornbeam, when\r\nthey could get it, for one of these places. It was a favorite material\r\nfor the handles of their stone warclubs. The stone heads were chipped to\r\nvarious forms, but were usually egg-shaped with a groove round the\r\nmiddle for fixing the handle. This was made fast with thongs of rawhide,\r\nand was generally nearly or quite two feet long, and slender as a golf\r\nstick. Great strength and a high degree of elasticity were required to\r\nstand the strain when a warrior swung his club in battle. Hornbeam meets\r\nthese requirements exactly, and doubtless the Indian found this out by\r\nexperience. It is about thirty per cent stronger than white oak, and\r\nforty-six per cent more elastic. The demand for warclub handles made no\r\ngreat inroads on the hornbeam supply, but it affords proof that the\r\nIndians sometimes used good judgment.\r\n\r\nThe different names of this tree describe some characteristic of the\r\nwood or foliage. The fruit resembles hops, hence one of the names.\r\nHardness gives it the other names by which it is known. It is the custom\r\nnearly everywhere to call any wood ironwood if it is extra hard. No\r\nfewer than eleven species of the United States are known as ironwood in\r\nsome parts of their ranges.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of hornbeam are simple and alternate; they taper to a sharp\r\npoint at the end, while the base is rounded. They are doubly and sharply\r\nserrate. In color they are dark green above, and lighter below, tufted\r\nin places, resembling birch leaves in some respects, although they are\r\nquite different in texture, the leaves of birch being glossy, while\r\nthose of ironwood are rough. They are joined to the twig with a short\r\npetiole, hardly a fourth of an inch in length.\r\n\r\nThe flowers grow in long catkins, staminate ones sometimes more than two\r\ninches long, covered with fringed scales. The pistillate catkins are\r\nusually shorter. Hornbeam blooms in April and May and its fruit ripens\r\nin August and September. The seed is a small nut equipped with\r\nballoon-like wings, intended for wind distribution. The seeds are often\r\ncarried, rolled, and tumbled considerable distances. They keep on going\r\nuntil their wings are torn off or wear out, or until they become\r\ninextricably entangled among twigs or other obstacles. Comparatively few\r\nof the seeds ever find lodgment in situations suitable for germination.\r\nConsequently, hornbeam is scarce.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to state the average size of the hornbeam, though it is\r\nusually small and never very large. Sometimes it reaches a height of\r\nfifty or sixty feet and a diameter of two or more, but such sizes are\r\nunusual. Trees a foot in diameter and forty feet high are more common.\r\nThe foliage is thin, and the tree is satisfied to grow in shade,\r\nprovided the shadows are not too dense. The leaves must have a little\r\nsunshine, and the flecks that fall through the open spaces in the forest\r\ncanopy high above, suffice. The hornbeam makes no effort to overtop its\r\nfellow trees; but when it grows in the open, as on a rocky bank or\r\nridge, where it catches the full light, the crown puts on more leaves,\r\nand multiplies its branches, and it is no longer the lean tree which\r\nsome of the Indians called it. Forest grown specimens produce clear\r\ntrunks, but those in the open are limby almost to the ground.\r\n\r\nHornbeam has neither smell nor taste. It burns well, the embers glowing\r\nbrightly in still air. The weight of a cubic foot of seasoned wood is\r\nfifty-one pounds. It is strong, hard, heavy, tough, and exceedingly\r\ndurable when exposed to variable weather, or when in contact with the\r\nsoil. It takes a beautiful polish. Trees more than a foot in diameter\r\nare often found to be hollow.\r\n\r\nThe wood is strong, hard, tough, durable in contact with the soil;\r\nheartwood light brown, tinged with red, or often nearly white; thick,\r\npale sapwood which generally does not change to heart for forty or fifty\r\nyears. The annual rings are not uniform in appearance. Some are easily\r\ndistinguishable, while others are vague. This variation is due to the\r\nirregular development of the dark summerwood in the outer portion of the\r\nrings. It is at times distinct and again is hardly discernible.\r\n\r\nThe wood is diffuse-porous, and the pores are too small to be easily\r\nseen by the naked eye. The medullary rays are small and obscure. In\r\nquarter-sawed wood they show as a silvery gloss, but the appearance is\r\ntoo monotonous to be attractive. Neither is there striking figure when\r\nthe wood is sawed tangentially, because of the small contrast in the\r\ndifferent parts of the yearly ring. Hornbeam may, therefore, be listed\r\namong woods which have little or no figure. No one ever thinks of using\r\nit for the sake of its beauty. Because of the small size and limited\r\nquantity hornbeam will never come into commercial prominence. Its uses\r\nare almost entirely local and domestic. The lumberman or the farmer\r\nselects a hornbeam sapling as being the best material obtainable for\r\nmaking a wagon or sleigh tongue, a skid, or a lever. The farmer often\r\nlaboriously works a section of the flint-like wood into minor\r\nagricultural implements.\r\n\r\nThe statistics of sawmill cut in the United States do not mention\r\nhornbeam even among such minor species as holly, Osage orange, alder,\r\nand apple. However, it is known that an occasional log goes to sawmills\r\nin the Lake States, and doubtless in other regions, and in some\r\ninstances the wood is kept separate from others and is sold to fill\r\nspecial orders. Manufacturers of farm tools consider it the best wood\r\nfor rake teeth. That use has come down from the time when farmers made\r\ntheir own rakes and pitchforks. They learned the wood’s value by\r\nexperience, and manufacturers cater to the trade.\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes called lever wood, and that name dates from long ago\r\nwhen the man who needed a lever went into the woods and cut one to suit\r\nhis needs. The modern lever is usually somewhat different and partakes\r\nmore of the nature of a handle. They are seen in sawmills where they\r\nmanipulate the carriage machinery; on certain agricultural implements\r\nwhere their function is to throw clutches in and out of gear; sometimes\r\nthey are used as the handle by which the rudder of a small boat is\r\ncontrolled; and occasionally the lever has a place as an adjunct of a\r\nwagon or log-car brake. In all of these uses strength and stiffness are\r\nrequired, and durability is duly considered.\r\n\r\nWagon makers and repairers find several uses for hornbeam. It would be\r\nmore frequently employed if it were more plentiful. Nearly any\r\nblacksmith who runs a repair shop for vehicles will testify to that. It\r\nfulfills every requisite for axles; is made into felloes for heavy\r\nwagons; and is considered the best obtainable wood for the tongues of\r\nheavy logging wheels and stone wagons.\r\n\r\nAmong various occasional uses of this wood it is listed by the\r\nmanufacturers of reels for garden hose; rungs for long ladders; stakes\r\nfor sleds, and also for cross pieces and parts of runners of sleds;\r\nwedges for the makers of machinery; and hammer and hatchet handles. It\r\nis a pretty active competitor of dogwood for some of these uses, and it\r\nhas been suggested for shuttles, but no report of its use in that\r\ncapacity seems to have been made.\r\n\r\nOne of its most common uses is as fence posts. Few lines of fence are\r\nbuilt exclusively of hornbeam posts, because not enough can be had in\r\none place; but posts are cut singly or a few together from Maine to\r\nArkansas, and the aggregate number is large. The wood is said to outlast\r\nthe heartwood of white oak when in contact with the ground, and it is so\r\nstrong that posts of small size stand the pull of wires or the weight of\r\nplanks or pickets.\r\n\r\nHornbeam is of slow growth and there is little reason to believe that it\r\nwill ever be seriously considered by timber growers; but it will\r\ndoubtless win its way to favor as an ornamental tree. It has been\r\nplanted in city parks in New England and elsewhere, and its form,\r\nfoliage, and habits are much liked. The pale green pods or cones--they\r\nare not exactly the one or the other--remain a long time on the branches\r\nand are delicately ornamental until after the autumn frosts change their\r\ngreen into brown. Then comes the flying time of the balloon seeds, and\r\nthat is an interesting period in parks and yards where the tree’s habits\r\nmay be closely studied.\r\n\r\n    KNOWLTON HORNBEAM (_Ostrya knowltoni_) is interesting chiefly on\r\n    account of its extremely limited range, and its far removal from all\r\n    its kin. It is an exile in a distant country. It has thus far been\r\n    found only on the southern slope of the canyon of the Colorado river\r\n    in Arizona, about seventy miles north of Flagstaff. It occurs at an\r\n    elevation of 6,000 or 7,000 feet above the sea. Trees are twenty or\r\n    thirty feet high and twelve or eighteen inches in diameter, and\r\n    trunks usually divide a foot or two above the ground into three or\r\n    more branches, which are often crooked and contorted. Such sizes and\r\n    forms could not be of much value for anything but fuel, even if\r\n    abundant. The heart is light reddish-brown, sapwood thin. The leaves\r\n    are round instead of pointed at the apex, as with the other\r\n    hornbeam; but the flowers and fruit are much the same. Botanists\r\n    speculate in vain as to how this species happens to be so far\r\n    removed from other members of its family.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSILVERBELL\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SILVERBELL]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSILVERBELL TREE\r\n\r\n(_Mohrodendron Carolinum_)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis tree belongs to the storax family, which is not a very numerous\r\nfamily as forest families are generally counted, but it is old and\r\nhighly respectable. Its members are found in the old world and the new\r\nin both North and South America, in Europe, Asia, and the Malay\r\nArchipelago. Trees of the storax family produce, or they are supposed to\r\nproduce, resins and gums, balsams, and aromatic exudations, but some\r\ngive little or none. The priests and soothsayers of idolatrous nations\r\nof ancient times laid great stress on storax. They insisted on having\r\nthe resin as an adjunct to their superstitious rites. It was the incense\r\noffered in their worship, and they compassed sea and land to obtain it\r\nfor that purpose. It is not improbable that the southern peninsulas of\r\nAsia and the far-off Molucca islands were visited in ancient times to\r\nprocure the incense which ultimately found its way to the Mediterranean\r\nregions.\r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, interesting to find that two members of the old storax\r\nfamily are quietly living in the coast region and among the mountains of\r\nthe southeastern part of the United States. No one has ever suspected\r\nthat they might be capable of yielding resinous incense suitable for the\r\naltars of heathen gods. They are the silverbell tree, and its little\r\ncousin, the snowdrop tree (_Mohrodendron dipterum_). They have had\r\ncommon names a long time, but their botanical names are the result of a\r\nrecent christening. They are named from Charles Mohr who wrote an\r\ninteresting book on the flora of Alabama. The silverbell tree is the\r\nlarger of the two and deserves first consideration.\r\n\r\nIt has a somewhat extensive range, but in some parts it is so scarce\r\nthat few persons ever see it. It is found from the mountains of West\r\nVirginia to southern Illinois, south to middle Florida, northern\r\nAlabama, and Mississippi, and through Arkansas and western Louisiana to\r\neastern Texas. Under cultivation, this tree is known as the snowdrop\r\ntree in Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, South Carolina,\r\nFlorida, and Louisiana. In Rhode Island, under cultivation, it is also\r\nsometimes known as the silverbell tree, and bears the same name in\r\nAlabama, Florida, and Mississippi. In parts of Tennessee it is known as\r\nthe wild olive tree, and in other parts of the state as the bell tree.\r\nIn various localities in Alabama it is referred to as the four-winged\r\nhalesia; and in others as opossumwood. It is indiscriminately known in\r\nvarious sections of Texas as the rattlebox and calicowood, and some of\r\nthe furniture manufacturers in North Carolina list it as box elder,\r\nthough it is only distantly related to the true box elder. In the Great\r\nSmoky mountains in Tennessee, where the species reaches its greatest\r\ndevelopment, it bears a variety of names, among them being tisswood,\r\npeawood, bellwood, and chittamwood.\r\n\r\nThe tree varies in size from a shrubby form so small that it is scarcely\r\nentitled to the name of tree, up to a height of eighty, ninety, and even\r\nmore than 100 feet with diameters up to nearly four feet. The largest\r\nsizes occur only among the ranges of the Great Smoky mountains in\r\nBlount, Sevier, and Monroe counties, Tennessee. No reason is known why\r\nthis tree in that region should so greatly exceed its largest dimensions\r\nin other areas; but most species have a locality where the greatest\r\ndevelopment is reached, and this has found the favorable conditions in\r\nthe mountains of eastern Tennessee. Some of the trees measure sixty feet\r\nor more to the first limbs.\r\n\r\nLumbermen of the country are not generally acquainted with silverbell,\r\nas is natural since its commercial range is so limited. It is not listed\r\nin statistics of sawmill cut or of veneer mills. The wood-using\r\nindustries of the country do not report it, except in the one state,\r\nNorth Carolina, and there in very small amounts. Doubtless, it is\r\noccasionally used elsewhere, but it escapes mention in most instances.\r\nIt has been made into mantels at Knoxville, Tennessee, and passes as\r\nbirch.\r\n\r\nThe wood is light, soft, usually narrow-ringed, color light brown, the\r\nthick sapwood lighter. It weighs thirty-five pounds per cubic foot, and\r\nwhen burned it yields a low percentage of ash. The wood’s chief value is\r\ndue to its color and figure. Best results are not obtained by sawing the\r\nlogs into lumber, because the handsomest part of the figure is apt to be\r\nlost. It is preëminently suited to the cutting of rotary veneer. By that\r\nmethod of conversion the birdseye and the pitted and mottled effects are\r\nbrought out in the best possible manner. Veneers so cut from logs\r\nselected for the figure, possess a rare beauty which no other American\r\nwood equals. There is a pleasing blend of tones, which are due to the\r\ndirection in which the distorted grain is cut. This distinguishes the\r\nwood from all others and gives it an individuality. Much of the figure\r\nappears to be due to the presence of adventitious buds, similar to those\r\nsupposed to be responsible for the birdseye effect in maple.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of silverbell are bright green at maturity and are from four\r\nto six inches long and two or three wide. They turn yellow before\r\nfalling in autumn. The flowers give the tree its name, for they resemble\r\ndelicate bells, about one inch in length. They appear in early spring\r\nwhen the leaves are one-third grown, on slender, drooping stems from one\r\nto two inches long. The trees are loaded throughout the whole crown,\r\nand present an appearance that is seldom surpassed for beauty in the\r\nforests of this country.\r\n\r\nThe fruit is peculiar and is not particularly graceful. It has too much\r\nthe appearance of the load carried by a well-fruited vine of hops. It\r\nripens late in autumn and persists during most of the winter. There is\r\nnothing in its color, shape, or taste to tempt birds or other creatures\r\nto make food of it, though, under stress of circumstances, they may\r\nsometimes do so. The fruit is two inches or less in length and an inch\r\nwide, and has four wings, which seem to be practically useless for\r\nflight. The seed is about half an inch long.\r\n\r\nThe bark of the trunk is bright red-brown and about half an inch thick,\r\nwith broad ridges which separate on the surface into thin papery scales.\r\nThe young branches wear an early coat of thick, pale wool or hairs,\r\nlight, reddish-brown during the first summer, but later changing to an\r\norange color.\r\n\r\nThe botanical range of the species is extensive, though the tree-form is\r\nconfined to a few counties among the southern Appalachian mountains. The\r\nnorthern limit of its range is in West Virginia where it is so scarce\r\nthat many a woodsman never recognizes it. Unless it is caught while in\r\nthe full glory of its bloom, it attracts no attention. It is not there a\r\ntree, but a shrub, hidden away among other growth, along mountain\r\nstreams or on slopes where the soil is fertile. The blooming shrub\r\nmight, at a distance, be mistaken for a dogwood in full blossom, but a\r\ncloser inspection corrects the mistake.\r\n\r\nIt is true of this species as of many others that the range has been\r\ngreatly extended by planting. The bell-like white flowers early drew\r\nattention of nurserymen who were on the lookout for trees for ornamental\r\nplanting. It was carried to Europe long ago, and graces many a yard and\r\npark in the central and northern countries of that continent. It now\r\ngrows and thrives in the United States six hundred miles northeast of\r\nits natural range, where it endures the winters of eastern\r\nMassachusetts, blooms as bounteously as in its native haunts among the\r\nshaded streams of the Alleghany mountains.\r\n\r\nSNOWDROP TREE (_Mohrodendron dipterum_) is a near relative of the\r\nsilverbell tree, and looks much like it, except that it is smaller, has\r\nlarger leaves, and the flowers are creamy-white. The two occupy the same\r\nterritory in part of their ranges, but they differ in one respect. The\r\nsilverbell tree grows with great luxuriance among the mountains while\r\nthe snowdrop tree keeps to the low country and is seldom or never found\r\ngrowing naturally at any considerable elevation. It prefers swamps or\r\ndamp situations near the coast. While the silverbell tree’s range\r\nincludes West Virginia, that of the snowdrop extends no farther north\r\nthan South Carolina. It follows the coast to Texas, and runs north\r\nthrough Louisiana to central Arkansas. Its range has been greatly\r\nenlarged by planting, and the northern winters do not kill it on the\r\nsouthern shores of Lake Erie. The largest trees are about thirty feet\r\nhigh and six inches in diameter, but the growth in most places is\r\nshrubby. Leaves are four or five inches long and three or four wide.\r\nFlowers are one inch long and are borne in profusion. They constitute\r\nthe tree’s chief value as an ornament, though the foliage is attractive.\r\nThe bloom lasts a month or six weeks, from the middle of March till the\r\nlast of April. The fruit has two wings instead of four, as with\r\nsilverbell, but occasionally two rudimentary wings are present. The wood\r\nis light, soft, strong, color light brown, with thicker, lighter\r\nsapwood. The smallness of the trunks makes their use for lumber\r\nimpossible. The species is valuable for ornamental purposes only, and\r\nhas been planted both in this country and Europe. It has a number of\r\nnames by which it is known in different localities, among them being\r\ncowlicks in Louisiana, and silverbell tree in the North where it has\r\nbeen planted outside of its natural range.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSYCAMORE\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SYCAMORE]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSYCAMORE\r\n\r\n(_Platanus Occidentalis_)\r\n\r\n\r\nProbably no person with a practical knowledge of trees ever mistakes\r\nsycamore for anything else. The tree stands clear-cut and distinct.\r\nUntil the trunk becomes old, it sheds its outer layer of bark yearly, or\r\nat least frequently, and the exfoliation exposes the white, new bark\r\nbelow. The upper part of the trunk and the large branches are white and\r\nconspicuous in the spring, and are recognizable at a long distance. No\r\nother tree in the American forest is as white. The nearest approach to\r\nit is the paper birch of the North, or the white birch of New England.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the tree’s individuality, it has a good many names. It\r\nis generally known as sycamore throughout the states of the Union, but\r\nit is frequently called buttonwood in Vermont, New Hampshire, Rhode\r\nIsland, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware,\r\nSouth Carolina, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, Arkansas,\r\nMissouri, Illinois, Nebraska, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Ontario;\r\nbuttonball tree in several of the eastern states and occasionally in\r\nIllinois, Iowa, Ohio, Michigan, and Nebraska; the plane tree in Rhode\r\nIsland, Delaware, South Carolina, Kansas, Nebraska, and Iowa; the water\r\nbeech in Delaware; the platane, cottonier, and bois puant in Louisiana.\r\nProbably the finest growth of the sycamore ever encountered was in Ohio\r\nand Indiana, and these states still contain isolated patches of\r\nmagnificent specimens of the wood. The Black Swamp of Ohio was\r\noriginally a famous sycamore country, of which Defiance was the center\r\nof lumber manufacture. Many parts of Indiana produced a good sycamore\r\ngrowth, and a considerable amount of timber of excellent quality still\r\nexists, but is now largely owned by farmers who are generally holding it\r\nout of the market.\r\n\r\nThe range of sycamore extends from Maine to Nebraska, and south to Texas\r\nand Florida. It is one of the largest of American hardwoods, and in\r\ndiameter of trunk it is exceeded by none. Trees are on record that were\r\nfrom ten to fourteen feet in diameter, and it was not unusual in the\r\nprimeval forests for them to tower nearly or quite 125. In height a\r\nnumber of hardwoods exceed it, the yellow poplar in particular; but none\r\nof them has a larger trunk than the largest sycamores. However, the\r\nmammoths are generally hollow. The heart decays as rings of new growth\r\nare added to the outside of the shell. So large were the cavities in\r\nsome of the sycamores in the original forests that more than one case is\r\non record of their being used by early settlers as places of abode.\r\n\r\nThe tree thrives best in the immediate vicinity of rivers and creeks. It\r\nneeds abundance of water for its roots, but is not insistent in its\r\ndemand for deep, fertile soil, for it grows on gravel bars along water\r\ncourses, provided some soil and sand are mixed with the gravel. Great\r\nage is doubtless attained, but records are necessarily lacking in cases\r\nwhere the annual rings of growth must be depended upon; because the\r\nhollow trunks have lost most of their rings by decay.\r\n\r\nSycamore bears abundance of light seed which is scattered short\r\ndistances by wind and much farther by running water. Its ideal place for\r\ngerminating is on muddy shores and wet flats. Here the seeds are\r\ndeposited by wind and water, and in a short time multitudes of seedlings\r\nspring up. Though most of them are doomed to perish before they attain a\r\nheight of a few feet, survivors are sufficient to assure thick stands on\r\nsmall areas. The trunks grow tall rapidly, and until they reach\r\nconsiderable size, they remain solid and make good sawlogs; but at an\r\nage of seventy-five or 100 years, deterioration is apt to set in; some\r\ndie, others become hollow, and the result is a good stand of large\r\nsycamores is unusual. The veterans are generally scattered through\r\nforests of other species.\r\n\r\nThe statement has often been made in recent years that sycamore is\r\nbecoming very scarce and that the annual output is rapidly declining.\r\nStatistics do not show a declining output. The cut of sycamore in 1909\r\nwas approximately twice as great as in 1899. It is true that the supply\r\nis not very large, and it never was large compared with some other\r\nhardwoods; but it appears to be holding its own as well as most forest\r\ntrees. The cut in the United States in 1910 was 45,000,000, and it was\r\ncredited to twenty-six states. Indiana was the largest contributor, and\r\nit had held that position a long time. States next below it in the order\r\nnamed were Missouri, Arkansas, Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio, and Illinois.\r\nDoubtless some of the sycamore lumber now going to market has grown\r\nsince old settlers cut the primeval stands when they cleared their\r\nfields. It will continue to grow, and since it usually occupies waste\r\nplaces, it may be depended upon to contribute pretty regularly year by\r\nyear during time to come. It is one of the forest trees which have never\r\nsuffered much from fires, because it grows in damp situations.\r\n\r\nThe wood of sycamore weighs 35.39 pounds per cubic foot, is hard, but\r\nnot strong, difficult to split and work; the annual rings are limited by\r\nnarrow bands of dark summerwood. The rings are very porous. The\r\nmedullary rays are rather small, but can be easily seen without a glass.\r\nThey run in regular, radial lines, close together, and the pores are in\r\nrows between. The rays of sycamore vary from the rule with most woods,\r\nin that they are darker than the body of the wood.\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest uses of sycamore was by farmers who cut hollow\r\ntrunks, sawed them in lengths of three or four feet, nailed bottoms in\r\nthem, and used them for barrels for grain. They were called gums. Solid\r\nlogs two or three feet in diameter were cut in lengths of a foot or\r\nless, bored through the center, and used as wheels for ox carts. The ox\r\nyoke was often made of sycamore. Butchers used sycamore sections about\r\nthree feet high for meat blocks. The wood is tough, and continual\r\nhacking fails to split it. The use for meat blocks continues at the\r\npresent time. In Illinois 1,600,000 feet were so employed in 1910.\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest employments of the wood for commercial purposes was\r\nin the manufacture of boxes for plug tobacco; but it has now been\r\nlargely replaced by cheaper woods. Its freedom from stain and odor is\r\nits chief recommendation for tobacco boxes. Some of it is in demand for\r\ncigar boxes.\r\n\r\nThe modern uses of sycamore are many. It is made into ordinary crates\r\nand shipping boxes in most regions where it grows. Rotary cut veneer is\r\nworked into berry crates and baskets, and into barrels. Ice boxes and\r\nrefrigerators are among the products. Slack coopers are among the\r\nlargest users, but some of the manufactured stave articles belong more\r\nproperly to woodenware, such as tubs, washing machines, candy buckets,\r\nand lard pails.\r\n\r\nFurniture makers demand the best grades, and most of the quarter-sawed\r\nstock goes to them, though the manufacturers of musical instruments buy\r\nsome of the finest. Use is pretty general from pipe organs and pianos\r\ndown to mandolins, guitars and phonographs. It enters extensively into\r\nthe making of miscellaneous commodities. As small a toy as the\r\nstereoscope consumes much sycamore. Makers of trunks find it suitable\r\nfor slats, and it serves as small squares and borders in parquetry. It\r\nis a choice wood for barber poles and saddle trees, and its fine\r\nappearance when worked in broad panels leads to its employment as\r\ninterior finish for houses, boats, and passenger cars.\r\n\r\n    CALIFORNIA SYCAMORE (_Platanus racemosa_) is one of the three\r\n    species of sycamore now found growing naturally in the United\r\n    States. They are survivors of a very old family and appear to have\r\n    been crowded down from the far North by the cold, or to have made\r\n    their way south for some other reason. Sycamores flourished in\r\n    Greenland in the Cretaceous age, some millions of years ago, as is\r\n    shown by fossil remains dug up in that land of ice and eternal\r\n    winter. They grew in central Europe, about the same time, but long\r\n    ago disappeared from there. Sycamores were growing in the United\r\n    States an immense period of time ago, and were doubtless lifting\r\n    their giant white branches high above the banks of ancient rivers\r\n    while the gorgeous bloom of yellow poplars brightened the forests on\r\n    the rich bottom lands farther back. Several species of sycamores\r\n    which grew in the United States during the Tertiary age are now\r\n    extinct. All seem to have been much like those which have come down\r\n    to the present day.\r\n\r\n    The California sycamore is found in the southern half of that state,\r\n    and in Lower California. It grows from sea level up to 5,000 feet,\r\n    and has the same habits as the larger sycamore of the East, and\r\n    prefers the banks of streams and the wet land in the bottoms of\r\n    canyons. It attains a height of from forty to eighty feet, and a\r\n    diameter of from two to five. Some trees are larger, one in\r\n    particular near Los Angeles having a trunk diameter of nine feet.\r\n    The tree is usually extremely distorted and misshaped, leaning,\r\n    twisted, and forking and reforking until a practical lumberman would\r\n    pronounce it a hopeless proposition. This applies, however, to\r\n    trunks which grow in the open, and that is where most of them grow.\r\n    When they are found crowded in thick stands in the bottoms of\r\n    canyons, their trunks are shapely enough for short sawlogs. The wood\r\n    is very similar to that of eastern sycamore, and it is used for\r\n    similar purposes, when used at all. The balls are strung five on one\r\n    tough stem, which is from six to ten inches long. The eastern\r\n    sycamore usually has a stem for each ball. The seeding habits of\r\n    both trees are the same.\r\n\r\n    ARIZONA SYCAMORE (_Platanus wrightii_) has its range in southern New\r\n    Mexico, southern Arizona, and neighboring regions in Mexico, where\r\n    it grows in the bottoms of canyons up to 6,000 feet above sea. The\r\n    tree attains a height of from thirty to eighty feet, and a diameter\r\n    of two to five. The trunk is seldom shapely, but often divides in\r\n    large branches, some of which are fifty or sixty feet long. There\r\n    are usually three balls on a stem, and the leaf is shaped much like\r\n    the leaf of red gum, but there is considerable variation in form.\r\n    The wood resembles eastern sycamore in color and most other\r\n    features, but when quarter-sawed the flecks produced by the\r\n    medullary rays are generally smaller, and give a mottled effect. The\r\n    wood has not been much used, but apparently it is not inferior to\r\n    eastern sycamore.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBLACK CHERRY\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BLACK CHERRY]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBLACK CHERRY\r\n\r\n(_Prunus Serotina_)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis widely distributed tree supplies the cherry wood of commerce. Its\r\nnatural range extends from Nova Scotia westward through the Canadian\r\nprovinces to the Kaministiquia river; south to Tampa bay in Florida and\r\nwest to North Dakota, eastern Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, and eastern\r\nTexas. The tree is known as wild black cherry, wild cherry, black\r\ncherry, rum cherry, whiskey cherry, and choke cherry.\r\n\r\nCherry belongs to a remarkably large family and the ordinary observer\r\nwould never suspect the relationship that exists between it and other\r\ngrowths to which it bears little resemblance. It is in the rose family\r\n(_Rosaceæ_). It has multitudes of small and large cousins, most of them\r\nsmall, however. Among them are the crabapple, the serviceberry, the\r\nhaws, thorns, plums, and the peach, besides plants which do not rise to\r\nthe dignity of trees.\r\n\r\nThe crown of black cherry is narrow and the branches are horizontal. In\r\nheight the tree ranges from fifty to one hundred or more feet. The bark\r\nis a dark reddish-brown, rough and broken into plates, becoming smoother\r\ntoward the top. The branchlets are a rich reddish-brown, and are marked\r\nwith tiny orange-colored dots. The leaves are small, alternate, oblong\r\nor oval lanceolate, taper-pointed at the apex and pointed or rounded at\r\nthe base, finely serrate; at maturity glabrous, firm, glossy, the light\r\ncolored midrib being very distinct. The flowers are white and grow on\r\npedicels in long slender racemes, which terminate leafy shoots. The\r\nfruit is almost black, showing deep red coloring beneath and is a small\r\nround drupe; vinous, although not disagreeable to the taste. In most\r\ninstances a liking for it must be acquired, but comparatively few people\r\never take the trouble to acquire it. The old settlers among the\r\nAlleghany mountains had a way of pressing the juice from the drupes and\r\nby some simple process converting it into “cherry bounce,” a beverage\r\nsomewhat bitter but it never went begging when the old-time mountaineers\r\nwere around. This was doubtless what persons had in mind who called it\r\nrum cherry. Few fruits, either wild or tame, contain more juice in\r\nproportion to bulk. Ripe fruit is employed as a flavor for alcoholic\r\nliquors. The bark contains hydrocyanic acid and is used in medicine. The\r\npeculiar odor of cherry bark is due to this acid.\r\n\r\nIn early years the ripening of the cherry crop among the ranges of the\r\nAppalachian mountains was a signal for bears to congregate where cherry\r\ntrees were thickest. The cubs were then large enough to follow their\r\nmothers--in August--and it was considered a dangerous season in the\r\ncherry woods, because the old bears would grow fierce if molested while\r\nfeeding. The mountaineers knew enough to stay away from the danger\r\npoints at that time, unless they went there purposely to engage in a\r\nbear fight. It was a common saying among those people that “cherry\r\nbears” should be let alone.\r\n\r\nThe cherry’s chief importance in this country has been due to its\r\nlumber. Unfortunately, that value lies chiefly in the past, for the\r\nsupply is running low. It never was very great, for, though the species\r\nhas a large range, it is sparingly dispersed through the forests. In\r\nmany parts of its range a person might travel all day in the woods and\r\nsee few cherry trees, and perhaps none. The best stands hardly ever\r\ncover more than a few acres. Generally the trees grow singly or in\r\nclumps. It appears to be nearly wholly a matter of soil and light, for\r\nthe seeds, which are carried by birds, are scattered in immense numbers,\r\nand only those grow which chance to find conditions just right. The tree\r\nwants rich ground and plenty of room, which is a combination not often\r\nfound in primeval forest regions; but, since the country has been\r\nlargely cleared, cherry trees spring up along fence rows and in nooks\r\nand corners. If let alone they grow rapidly, but trunks so produced are\r\nof little value for lumber, because too short and limby. In the forest\r\nthe tree lifts its light crown high on a slender trunk to reach the\r\nsunshine, and such trunks supply the cherry lumber of commerce. Near the\r\nnorthern limit of its range it seems to abandon its demand for good soil\r\nand is content if it is supplied with light only. It betakes itself to\r\nthe face of cliffs, sometimes overhanging the sea, and so near it that\r\nthe branches are drenched in spray thrown up by breakers. It is needless\r\nto say that no good lumber is produced under such circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe first loss of cherry occurred when the farms were cleared. It stood\r\non the best ground, and the land-hungry Anglo-Saxon wanted that for\r\nhimself. He cut the tall shapely cherry trees, built fences and barns of\r\nsome of the logs, and burned the balance in the clearing. Then came the\r\npioneer lumberman who did not take much, because his old up-and-down\r\nsaw, which was run by water, would cut only about a thousand feet a day,\r\nand there was plenty of other kinds of timber. But when the steam mill\r\nput in its appearance, cherry went fast. Its price was high enough to\r\npay for a long haul. From that day till this, cherry has gone to market\r\nas rapidly as millmen could get to it.\r\n\r\nNext to walnut, it is the highest priced lumber produced in the United\r\nStates. The average cut per mill, according to returns of those who\r\nsawed it in 1909, was only 11,200 feet, and the total output that year\r\nwas only 24,594,000 feet, contributed by twenty-nine states. The five\r\nleading producers were, in the order named, West Virginia,\r\nPennsylvania, New York, Ohio, and Indiana. The next year the total\r\noutput fell to 18,237,000 feet, and cherry went down to a place among\r\nthe “minor species,” such as dogwood, alder, locust, and buckeye. The\r\nday of its importance in the lumber industry is past. It has become too\r\nscarce to attract much attention, but there will always be some cherry\r\nin the market, though veteran trunks, three and four feet through and\r\ngood for four sixteen-foot logs, will be seldom seen in the years to\r\ncome.\r\n\r\nWhile good taste ordinarily dictates that cherry be finished in a tone\r\napproximating its natural color, it is quite frequent that it\r\nmasquerades as mahogany. A well-known and perfect method of making\r\ncherry look like mahogany is to have the wood rubbed with diluted nitric\r\nacid, which prepares it for the materials to be subsequently applied;\r\nafterwards, to a filtered mixture of an ounce and a half of dragon’s\r\nblood dissolved in a pint of spirits of wine, is added one-third that\r\nquantity of carbonate of soda, the whole constituting a very thin liquid\r\nwhich is applied to the wood with a soft brush. This process is repeated\r\nat short intervals until the wood assumes the external appearance of\r\nmahogany. While cherry is employed as an imitation of mahogany, it is in\r\nits turn imitated also. Sweet birch is finished to look like cherry, and\r\nfor that reason is sometimes known as cherry birch.\r\n\r\nCherry weighs 36.28 pounds per cubic foot; it is very porous, but the\r\npores are small and are diffused through all parts of the annual ring.\r\nThe wood has no figure. Its value is due to color and luster. The\r\nmedullary rays are numerous but small, and in quarter-sawing they do not\r\nshow as mirrors, like oak, but as a soft luster covering the whole\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nThe principal uses of cherry have always been in furniture and finish,\r\nbut it has many minor uses, such as tool handles, boxes for garden\r\nseeds, spirit levels and other tools, and implements, patterns,\r\npenholders, actions for organs and piano players, baseblocks for\r\nelectrotypes and other printing plates, and cores for high-class panels.\r\nAside from its color, its chief value is due to its comparative freedom\r\nfrom checking and warping. This cherry is one of the few trees that\r\ncross the equator. It extends from Canada far down the west coast of\r\nSouth America.\r\n\r\n    CHOKE CHERRY (_Prunus virginiana_) is widely distributed in North\r\n    America from Canada to Mexico. It is said to attain its largest size\r\n    in the Southwest where trees are sometimes forty feet high and a\r\n    foot in diameter. The name is due to the astringency of the half\r\n    ripe fruit which can scarcely be eaten. When fully ripe it is a\r\n    little more tolerable, and is then black, but is red before it is\r\n    ripe. The color of immature cherries deceives the unsophisticated\r\n    into believing they are ripe. In Canada the fruit is made into pies\r\n    and jelly, and it is said the tree is occasionally planted for its\r\n    fruit. The Indians of former times made food of it. The tree is\r\n    small, and bruised branches emit a disagreeable odor; leaves contain\r\n    prussic acid, and when partly withered, they are poisonous to\r\n    cattle. The trunks are nearly always too small for commercial\r\n    purposes, and are apt to be affected with a fungous disease known as\r\n    black knot.\r\n\r\n    WESTERN CHOKE CHERRY (_Prunus demissa_) grows from the Rocky\r\n    Mountains to the Pacific in the United States. It is often regarded\r\n    as the western form of choke cherry, but it has more palatable\r\n    fruit, and trees are a little larger, while trunks are so crooked\r\n    that no user of wood cares to have anything to do with them. The\r\n    wood is weak, but is hard and heavy.\r\n\r\n    BITTER CHERRY (_Prunus emarginata_) belongs to the far West, and is\r\n    found from British Columbia to southern California. In size it\r\n    ranges from a low shrub to a tree a foot in diameter and forty feet\r\n    high. The largest sizes are found in western Washington and Oregon.\r\n    The wood is soft and brittle, brown streaked with green. It is not\r\n    known that any attempt has been made to put the wood of this tree to\r\n    any useful purpose. The bark and the leaves are exceedingly bitter.\r\n    Fruit ripens from June to August, depending on region and elevation,\r\n    and it is from one-fourth to one-half inch in diameter, black, and\r\n    intensely bitter.\r\n\r\n    HOLLYLEAF CHERRY (_Prunus ilicifolia_) is a California species\r\n    growing in the bottoms of canyons from San Francisco bay to the\r\n    Mexican line. It is rarely more than thirty feet high, but has a\r\n    large trunk, sometimes two feet in diameter. The wood is heavy,\r\n    hard, and strong, and it ought to be valuable in the manufacture of\r\n    small articles, but fuel is the only use reported for it. The fruit\r\n    is insipid, and ripens late in autumn. The foliage is much admired\r\n    and has led to the planting of the species for ornamental purposes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILD RED CHERRY\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILD RED CHERRY]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILD RED CHERRY\r\n\r\n(_Prunus Pennsylvanica_)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to the name wild red cherry by which this tree is known in\r\nmost parts of its range, it is called bird cherry in Maine, New\r\nHampshire, New York, Pennsylvania, Minnesota, Iowa; red cherry in Maine\r\nand Rhode Island; fire cherry in New York and many other localities; pin\r\ncherry in Vermont, New Hampshire, New York, Michigan, Iowa, and North\r\nDakota; pigeon cherry in Vermont, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, New York,\r\nOntario, and North Dakota; and wild cherry in Tennessee and New York.\r\nIts range extends from Newfoundland to Hudson bay, west to British\r\nColumbia, south through the Rocky Mountains to Colorado, and in the East\r\nalong the Appalachian ranges to North Carolina and Tennessee. It reaches\r\nits largest size among the Big Smoky mountains in Tennessee and North\r\nCarolina.\r\n\r\nIt is ordinarily a tree thirty or forty feet high, and from eight to ten\r\ninches in diameter, though trunks are sometimes twenty inches through.\r\nIt grows fast, but is very short-lived. Many stands disappear in thirty\r\nyears or less, but individuals survive two or three times that long, if\r\nthey stand in open ground. One of its names is fire cherry, and that\r\nfitly describes it. Like paper birch and lodgepole pine, it follows\r\nforest fires where the ground is laid bare by the burning. Nature seems\r\nto have made peculiar provisions whereby this tree clothes barren tracts\r\nwhich have been recently burned. In the first place, it is a prolific\r\nseeder. Its small, red cherries are borne by bushels on very young\r\ntrees. Birds feed on them almost exclusively while they last, and the\r\nseeds are scattered over the surrounding country. They have such thick\r\nshells that few germinate unless they pass through a moderate fire,\r\nwhich cracks the shells, or at least they do not sprout until they come\r\nin direct contact with mineral soil. When a fire burns a forest,\r\nthousands of the cherry seedlings spring up. Many persons have wondered\r\nwhere they come from so quickly. They were already scattered among the\r\nforest leaves before the fire passed. The heat crazed their shells, and\r\nthe burning of the leaflitter let them down on the mineral soil where\r\nthey germinated and soon came up by thousands. The case is a little\r\ndifferent with paper birch and with aspen, which are also fire trees.\r\nTheir seeds cannot pass through fire without perishing, and when birches\r\nand aspens follow a fire it means that the seeds were scattered by the\r\nwind after the passing of the fire. Doubtless cherry seeds are often\r\nscattered after the fire has passed; but it is believed that most of\r\nthose which spring up so quickly have passed through the fire without\r\nbeing destroyed.\r\n\r\nThis small cherry is one of the means by which damage by forest fires is\r\nrepaired. The tree is of little value for lumber or even for fuel; but\r\nit acts as a nurse tree--that is, it shelters and protects the seedlings\r\nof other species until they obtain a start. By the time the cherry trees\r\ndie, the seedlings which they have nursed are able to take care of\r\nthemselves, and a young forest of valuable species is established.\r\n\r\nExcept in this indirect way, the wild red cherry is of little use to\r\nman. The wood is soft, light, and of pleasing color, but trees are\r\nnearly always too small to be worked into useful articles. About the\r\nonly industry of which there is any record, which draws supplies from\r\nthis source, is the manufacture of pipe stems. The straight, slender,\r\nbright-barked branches are cut into requisite lengths and bored endwise,\r\nand serve for stems of cheap pipes, and occasionally for those more\r\nexpensive. The bark, like that of most cherries, is marked by dark bands\r\nrunning part way round the stems. These are known as lenticels, and\r\nexist in the bark of most trees, but they are usually less conspicuous\r\nin others than in cherry. It is this characteristic marking which gives\r\nthe cherry pipe stem its value.\r\n\r\nWild red cherry blooms from May to July, depending on latitude and\r\nelevation, and the fruit ripens from July to September. The cherries\r\nhang in bunches, are bright red, quite sour, and the seed is the largest\r\npart. They are occasionally made into jelly, wine, and form the basis of\r\ncertain cough syrups.\r\n\r\nWEST INDIA CHERRY (_Prunus sphærocarpa_) grows near the shores of\r\nBiscayne bay, Florida. It there blooms in November and the fruit ripens\r\nthe next spring. The tree attains a height of from twenty-five to thirty\r\nfeet, and a diameter of five or six inches. When grown in the open at\r\nMiami, Florida, it is larger, and is much liked as an ornament. The\r\nthin, smooth bark is brown, tinged with red, and is marked by large\r\nconspicuous lenticels. The wood is hard and light, and of light clear\r\nred color. It is too scarce to be of much importance, but paper knives,\r\nnapkin rings, and other novelties made of it are sold in souvenir stores\r\nin southern Florida. Its range extends south to Brazil.\r\n\r\nWILLOWLEAF CHERRY (_Prunus salicifolia_) is a small tree, also called\r\nMexican cherry, is more common south of the United States than in this\r\ncountry, ranging as far south as Peru. It is found on some of the\r\nmountains of southern New Mexico and Arizona.\r\n\r\nLAUREL CHERRY (_Prunus caroliniana_) is a southern species which sticks\r\nclose to the coast in most of its range from South Carolina to Texas. It\r\nhas many names, among them wild peach, wild orange, mock orange,\r\nevergreen cherry, mock olive, and Carolina cherry. Leaves hang two\r\nyears, and the fruit remains nearly one. The latter is black and about\r\nhalf an inch long. The withered leaves are poisonous if eaten by cattle.\r\nThe tree is thirty or forty feet high, and eight or ten inches in\r\ndiameter. The wood is heavy, hard, and strong, color light brown to\r\ndark, rich brown, sometimes of much beauty, but no record has been found\r\nof any use for it. The tree is often planted for ornament.\r\n\r\n    WILD PLUM (_Prunus americana_) is found from New Jersey to Montana,\r\n    southward to New Mexico and Texas, and extends to Florida and\r\n    Mexico. Its range covers about a million square miles. There are\r\n    seven or more species of wild plums in the United States. The fruit\r\n    of all of them is edible. They have been planted accidentally or\r\n    otherwise in many localities where they were not found before the\r\n    country was settled. The plum was an important fruit in the\r\n    country’s early history. The pioneers gathered wild fruits before\r\n    planted orchards came into bearing, and the plum was one of the best\r\n    which nature supplied. Early travelers among the Indians in the\r\n    South frequently spoke of Indian peaches. Such references have led\r\n    some to believe that the peach was native in that region, but it is\r\n    safe to conclude that what was called the peach was really some\r\n    species of wild plum. These fruits were among the earliest to become\r\n    domesticated. In fact, they were abundant about the sites of Indian\r\n    towns and old fields, where the savages had scattered seeds without\r\n    any purpose on their part of planting trees; and early settlers\r\n    imitated the Indians, and plums were soon growing in the vicinity of\r\n    most of the cabins. As a forest tree, it usually thrived best on the\r\n    banks of streams, for there it could find more sunshine than in the\r\n    deep woods, and it bore much more fruit. The ranges of several\r\n    species of plums overlapped, and different sizes and colors of fruit\r\n    were found in the same locality even before white men assisted the\r\n    spread of species. The common plum, known to botanists as _Prunus\r\n    americana_, is recognized under many names among laymen; among these\r\n    names are yellow plum, red plum, horse plum, hog plum, August plum,\r\n    native plum, and goose plum. Usually the plum’s skin is red, and the\r\n    flesh yellow, which accounts for its names, both red and yellow. The\r\n    tree ranges in height from twenty to thirty-five feet, and from five\r\n    to ten inches in diameter. The wood is heavy, hard, and strong, and\r\n    dark rich-brown. It is suitable for turnery and small novelties, but\r\n    little of it has been used.\r\n\r\n    CANADA PLUM (_Prunus nigra_) appears to be the most northern member\r\n    of the plum group. It grows from Newfoundland to Manitoba, and south\r\n    into the northern tier of states. Its range has been much extended\r\n    by planting, and a number of varieties have appeared. It is twenty\r\n    or thirty feet high, and five to eight inches in diameter. Flowers\r\n    appear in April and May, and the fruit is ripe in September and\r\n    October. The plums are about an inch long, orange-red in color, with\r\n    yellow flesh. The wood is heavy, hard, and strong. Those who\r\n    cultivate this tree often do so for the beauty of the flowers,\r\n    rather than for the value of the fruit. The wood is not used for\r\n    commercial purposes.\r\n\r\n    BLACK SLOE (_Prunus umbellata_), known also as southern bullace\r\n    plum, hog plum, and wild plum, ranges from South Carolina, round the\r\n    coast through Florida, to Louisiana and up the Mississippi valley\r\n    into Arkansas. The tree is fifteen or twenty feet high and from six\r\n    to ten inches in diameter. The fruit ripens from July to September,\r\n    is black when ripe, and often nearly an inch long. The people where\r\n    it grows use it for jelly. It is not reported that the wood is used\r\n    for any purpose.\r\n\r\n    WESTERN PLUM (_Prunus subcordata_) grows west of the Cascade\r\n    mountains from southern Oregon to central California. It is often a\r\n    low bush, but at its best forms a tree twenty feet high and six\r\n    inches in diameter, but its wood is of no economic importance. Its\r\n    deep, purple-red plums ripen in autumn and are an excellent wild\r\n    fruit, juicy and tart. During the fruit season the plum thickets\r\n    were formerly infested by both bears and Indians, and many a fight\r\n    for possession took place, with victory sometimes on one side,\r\n    sometimes on the other. The white inhabitants now make jam and jelly\r\n    of the fruit.\r\n\r\n    ALLEGHANY SLOE (_Prunus allegheniensis_) is so named because it is\r\n    best developed among the Alleghany mountains of Pennsylvania. The\r\n    tree is eighteen or twenty feet high and six or eight inches in\r\n    diameter. The wood is without value for commercial purposes, but the\r\n    tree’s fruit has some local importance. It ripens about the middle\r\n    of August, and is somewhat less than an inch in diameter, with dark,\r\n    reddish-purple skin, covering yellow flesh.\r\n\r\n    CHICKASAW PLUM (_Prunus angustifolia_) is a well-known wild plum of\r\n    the South from Delaware to Texas, and north to Kansas. Its natural\r\n    range is not known, because it has been so widely planted,\r\n    accidentally or otherwise, near farm houses and in fence corners.\r\n    Its bright, red fruit goes only to local markets. Negroes gather\r\n    most of the crop in the South. The wood is not considered to have\r\n    any value, but, in common with other plums, it possesses qualities\r\n    which fit it for many small articles.\r\n\r\n    GARDEN WILD PLUM (_Prunus hortulana_) is supposed to have originated\r\n    in Kentucky from a cross between the Chickasaw plum and the common\r\n    wild plum (Prunus americana). It has spread from Virginia to Texas.\r\n    The largest trees are thirty feet high and a foot in diameter. The\r\n    fruit ripens in September and October, is deep red or yellow, with\r\n    hard, austere, thin flesh, quite sour. The fruit is called wild\r\n    goose or simply goose plum in Tennessee and Kentucky.\r\n    Horticulturists have made many experiments with this plum.\r\n\r\n    COCOA PLUM (_Chrysobalanus icaco_), also called gopher plum, grows\r\n    in southern Florida, and its insipid fruit is seldom eaten except by\r\n    negroes and Seminole Indians. There is little sale for it in the\r\n    local markets. Trees are sometimes thirty feet high and a foot in\r\n    diameter. The light brown wood is heavy, hard, and strong, but it is\r\n    seldom used. The tree grows in Africa and South America as well as\r\n    in Florida.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBEECH\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BEECH]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBEECH\r\n\r\n(_Fagus Atropunicea_)\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is only one beech in the United States, and four or five in Europe\r\nand Asia. The southern portion of South America has several species\r\nwhich usually pass for beech. One or more of them are evergreen. Old\r\nworld species are sometimes planted in parks and cemeteries in this\r\ncountry, but as forest trees they have no importance in the United\r\nStates and probably never will have. It becomes a simple matter,\r\ntherefore, to deal with the tree in this country. It is alone, and has\r\nno nearer relatives than the chestnuts, chinquapins, and the oaks, all\r\nof which are members of the same family, and the beech gives the name to\r\nthe family--_Fagaceæ_. The blue beech, which is common in most states\r\neast of the Mississippi river and in some west, is not a member of the\r\nsame family, though it looks enough like beech to be closely related to\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe name has come down from remote antiquity. It is one of the oldest\r\nnames in use. It is said to have descended through thousands of years\r\nfrom old Aryan tribes of Asia which were among the earliest to use a\r\nwritten language. For the want of better material, they cut the letters\r\non beech bark, and a piece of such writing was called “boc.” It was but\r\na step from that word to book--a collection of writings. Both beech and\r\nbook came from the same word “boc” and the connection between them is\r\nvery evident. The pronunciation has been little changed by the Germanic\r\nraces during thousands of years, but the Romans translated it into Latin\r\nand called it “liber,” from which we have the word library. Doubtless in\r\nvery ancient times, say 5,000 years before the building of Solomon’s\r\ntemple, the libraries beyond the Euphrates river consisted of several\r\ncords of trimmed and lettered beech bark. Such material being\r\nperishable, it has wholly disappeared. The matter is not now directly\r\nconnected with the lumber interests, but it increases one’s respect for\r\nbeech to know how important a part it must have played in the ancient\r\nworld, whereby it stamped its name so indelibly upon the language of the\r\nmost intelligent portion of the human race.\r\n\r\nThe word buckwheat has the same origin. It means beech wheat, so named\r\nbecause the grains are triangular like beech nuts. The tree is always\r\nknown as beech in this country, though it may have a qualifying word\r\nsuch as red, white, ridge.\r\n\r\nIt usually grows in mixed forests of hardwoods, but it is often found in\r\nthe immediate presence of hemlock and spruce, grows from Maine to\r\nFlorida, and west to Arkansas. Considerable areas are often occupied by\r\nlittle else. This is attested by the frequency with which such names as\r\n“beech flat,” “beech ridge,” “beech woods,” and “beech bottom” are\r\nencountered in local geography. Perhaps the finest examples of beech\r\ngrowth in the United States occur in the higher altitudes of the lower\r\nAppalachian range in eastern Tennessee, and western North Carolina,\r\nwhere trees are frequently encountered, showing a bole of perfectly\r\nsymmetrical form, of from three to more than four feet in diameter, and\r\nof a sheer height of seventy feet before a limb is encountered. The wood\r\nwhich grows in this section is nearly as hard as that of the North, but\r\nthat growing on lower levels in the South is of a much softer texture\r\nand lighter color, the heart being pinkish rather than reddish-brown.\r\n\r\nBeech is one of the truly beautiful trees of the forest. In the eyes of\r\nmany, the beech is as much to be admired as the American elm or sugar\r\nmaple. Certainly in spring when it is covered with its staminate\r\nblossoms, it is a splendid sight, and its perfect leaves are seldom\r\nspotted or eaten by insects. In winter, it is particularly interesting.\r\nIts beautiful bark then appears very bright. After its fine leaves have\r\nfallen, though many of them, pale and dry, cling to the branches\r\nthroughout the winter, the structure of its massive head is seen to\r\nadvantage. In the Canadian markets and those of many of the middle and\r\nwestern states, its nuts are gathered and sold in considerable\r\nquantities. These nuts are favorite food of both the red and gray\r\nsquirrel and these rodents collect them in considerable quantities\r\nduring the late fall, and store them in tree hollows for their winter’s\r\nsupply of food. It often happens, in felling beech trees in the winter,\r\nthat shelled beech nuts to the quantity of a quart or more will be found\r\nsecreted in some hollow by these provident little animals.\r\n\r\nFormerly beech was little used for lumber, but was long ago given an\r\nimportant place as firewood and material for charcoal. Its excellent\r\nqualities as lumber have now made it popular in most markets. The\r\nsapwood is comparatively thin and the heart is very much esteemed for\r\nmany purposes. Many millions of feet of it are converted into flooring\r\nand the “pure red” product is very highly esteemed for ornamental\r\nfloors. It has not as good working qualities as maple, but still it\r\nstays in place even better than does that famous flooring material.\r\nNearly all the large flooring factories of the North, whose principal\r\noutput is maple, have a side line of beech flooring, and in the South,\r\nnotably in Nashville, a considerable quantity of the wood is made into\r\nflooring. In full growth this beautiful tree is round topped, with wide\r\nspreading and horizontal branches, and shows a normal altitude of about\r\nsixty feet. In this form of growth branches appear on the body very\r\nclose to the ground, and their ends often trail upon it. In its forest\r\nform, where trees of any sort are of commercial importance, it often\r\nattains a height of ninety or 100 feet, with smooth rounded bole as\r\nsymmetrical as the pillar of a cathedral, with a diameter of from two to\r\nfour feet. Its time to bloom is April or May, and its nuts ripen in\r\nOctober. The bark is a light bluish-gray, and remarkably smooth; the\r\nleaves are simple, alternate, with very short petioles, oblong with\r\npointed apex and rounded or narrowed base. The ribs are straight,\r\nunbranching, and terminate in remote teeth. The fruit is a pair of\r\nthree-sided nuts with a sweet and edible kernel which grows in a\r\nfour-celled prickly burr, splitting when ripe.\r\n\r\nBeech is an excellent fuel and it has long been used for that purpose.\r\nIt is so regularly dispersed over the country that most neighborhoods\r\nwere able to get it in the years when families cut their own firewood.\r\nLater, when charcoal was burned to supply primitive iron furnaces,\r\nbefore coke could be had, beech was always sought for. Still later, when\r\nlarge commercial plants were built to carry on destructive distillation\r\nof wood, beech was still a favorite. Its modern uses are many. There is\r\nscarcely a plant east of the Rocky Mountains, engaged in the manufacture\r\nof hardwood commodities, which does not use beech. In Michigan alone\r\nnearly 30,000,000 feet a year are demanded by box makers, and more than\r\nthat much more by manufacturers of other commodities. It is widely\r\nemployed for furniture, filing cabinets, vehicles, interior finish,\r\nagricultural implements, woodenware, and musical instruments. It is one\r\nof the heaviest and strongest of the common hardwoods, and gives long\r\nservice when kept dry, but does not last well in damp situations.\r\n\r\nBeech is strictly a forest tree. This does not mean that it will not\r\ngrow in the open, but when it does grow there it makes poor lumber,\r\nshort and limby. The seedlings must have shade if they are to do any\r\ngood, but after they attain a certain size they can endure the light.\r\nThe roots lie close to the surface of the ground, and the trampling of\r\ncattle often kills large trees.\r\n\r\nBLUE BEECH (_Carpinus caroliniana_) is not in the beech family, but the\r\nname by which it is commonly known, and its resemblance to beech,\r\njustify its consideration with beech. The bluish color of the bark is\r\nresponsible for its common name, but it is known by several others,\r\namong them being water beech, because it often grows on or near the\r\nbanks of streams, and it seldom seems more at home than when it is\r\nhanging over the bank of a creek where shade is deep and moisture\r\nplentiful. It is often called hornbeam and ironwood, and it is closely\r\nrelated to hop hornbeam (_Ostrya virginiana_). It grows from Quebec, to\r\nFlorida and from Dakota to Texas, reaching its largest size in eastern\r\nTexas where it is sometimes sixty feet high and two in diameter, though\r\nthis size is unusual. Few trees develop a bole less acceptable to\r\nlumbermen. In addition to being short, crooked, twisted, and covered\r\nwith limbs, it is nearly always ribbed and fluted, so that a log, even\r\nif but a few feet long, is apt to be almost any shape except round. The\r\nthick sapwood is pale white, heart pale brown. The annual rings are\r\nusually easily seen, but they are vague, because of so little difference\r\nbetween the springwood and summerwood; diffuse-porous; medullary rays\r\nthin and usually seen only in the aggregate as a white luster where wood\r\nis sawed radially. The uses of this wood are many, but the amounts very\r\nsmall. It is made into singletrees and ax and hammer handles in\r\nMichigan, wagon felloes in Texas and other parts of the Southwest;\r\nlevers and other parts of agricultural implements in various localities.\r\nIt seldom goes to sawmills, is generally marketed in the form of bolts,\r\nand is hard, stiff, and strong.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHESTNUT\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHESTNUT]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHESTNUT\r\n\r\n(_Castanea Dentata_)\r\n\r\n\r\nFive species of chestnut are known, three of them in the United States.\r\nOne of these, _Castanea alnifolia_, is a shrub and has no place in a\r\nlist of trees. Chestnut and chinquapin are the two others. They are in\r\nthe beech family to which oaks belong also. The ancient Greeks\r\ndesignated these as food trees (_Fagaceæ_), not an inappropriate name\r\nfor chestnut which probably furnishes more human food than any other\r\nwild tree. Its range extends from Maine to Michigan and southward to\r\nNorth Carolina and Tennessee. It attains its greatest size in western\r\nNorth Carolina and eastern Tennessee. It is one of the few well-known\r\nwoods of the United States that does not bear a half dozen or more local\r\nnames in the various localities of its growth, but the wood is\r\ninvariably known as chestnut.\r\n\r\nTrees vary in size from sixty to 100 feet in height, and from two to\r\nfour in diameter. Trunks six feet through occur where trees have grown\r\nin the open, but such are not tall, and are not valuable for lumber.\r\nChestnut trees are sometimes heard of in this country with trunks ten\r\nand twelve feet through, but such must be very scarce, because no one\r\nseems to know just where they are located. It is not improbable that in\r\nrare cases such sizes have existed. In France and Italy trees much\r\nlarger are well authenticated, but that chestnut is of a species\r\ndifferent from ours.\r\n\r\nChestnut is a very long-lived tree where it is fortunate enough to\r\nescape the attacks of worms and disease; but as age comes on, it is\r\nalmost certain to be attacked. Insects bore the wood, and fungus induces\r\ndecay. Frequently the heartwood of large trunks is all gone, and the\r\ntrees stand mere shells with scarcely enough sound wood left to support\r\nthe diseased tops.\r\n\r\nFew species sprout with more vigor than chestnut. In the mountains of\r\neastern Tennessee, W. W. Ashe found that ninety-nine per cent of stumps\r\nsprout. This applies as well to veterans of three hundred years as to\r\nyoung growth. Sprouts which rise from the top of a high stump are liable\r\nto meet misfortune, because, under their disadvantage they cannot\r\ndevelop adequate root systems; but sprouts which spring from the root\r\ncollar, or near it, may grow to large trees. It is claimed by some that\r\na chestnut which grows from a sprout has straighter grain than one\r\nspringing from seed. The latter’s trunk is liable to develop a spiral\r\ntwist, not only of the wood, but also of the bark; but the sprout-grown\r\ntree lacks the twist.\r\n\r\nChestnut blooms in midsummer, and the profusion of pale golden catkins\r\nmakes the isolated tree a conspicuous object at that time. Bloom is\r\nnearly always abundant, but the nut crop fails frequently. Several\r\naccidents may happen, but the most frequent cause of scarcity in the\r\nchestnut crop is a spell of rainy weather while the trees are in bloom.\r\nThe rain hinders proper pollenization.\r\n\r\nMany thousands of bushels of chestnuts are sent to market yearly in the\r\nUnited States. The nuts are smaller but sweeter than those of European\r\nchestnut. The largest part of the crop is collected from trees in open\r\nground. Those in dense forests bear only a few nuts at the top.\r\nOpen-grown trees develop enormous and shapely crowns; and it is not\r\nunusual for farmers who value their nut bearing trees to pollard them.\r\nThis puts the tree out of consideration as a source of lumber. Its\r\nbranches multiply, but the trunk remains short. It is claimed that a\r\nchestnut orchard of good form and in a region where large crops are\r\nfrequent, is more profitable than an apple orchard. The tree does not\r\ndemand rich land, but must have well-drained soil. It grows on rocky\r\nslopes and ridges, and will prosper where most other valuable trees will\r\nbarely exist.\r\n\r\nIt grows rapidly in its early life, but does not maintain the rate many\r\ndecades. Large trees are old. In the southern Appalachians the ages of\r\ntelegraph poles forty feet long and six inches in diameter at the top\r\nrange from forty-five to sixty-five years. Trees of round fence-post\r\nsize may grow in fifteen years. Few trees will produce posts more\r\nquickly or in larger numbers per acre. In some instances nearly a\r\nthousand saplings large enough for posts stand on a single acre.\r\nSprout-growth chestnut often forms nearly pure stands of considerable\r\nextent.\r\n\r\nThe value of this tree is in its wood as well as its nuts. More than\r\n500,000,000 feet of lumber are cut from it yearly. Long before it was\r\nmuch thought of as a sawmill proposition, it was manufactured in large\r\namounts into rails and posts by farmers, particularly in New England and\r\nin the Appalachian region. Axes, crosscut saws, mauls, and wedges were\r\nthe means of manufacture. Untold millions of fence rails were split\r\nbefore wire fences were thought of. It is a durable wood, made so by the\r\ntannic acid it contains. As fence rails, it was more durable than the\r\nbest oak, and where both were equally convenient, farmers nearly always\r\nchose chestnut. On high and dry ridges a chestnut rail fence would last\r\nfrom twenty-five to fifty years, and in extreme cases very much longer,\r\neven a full century it is claimed.\r\n\r\nDry chestnut wood weighs 28.07 pounds per cubic foot, which makes it a\r\nlight wood. Its annual rings are as clearly marked as those of any tree\r\nin this country. The springwood is filled with large open pores, the\r\nsummerwood with small ones. The medullary rays are minute, and of no\r\nvalue in giving figure to the wood. Nevertheless, chestnut has strong\r\nfigure, but it is due solely to the arrangement of the spring and\r\nsummerwood of the annual rings. It is commonly classed as a\r\ncoarse-grained wood. The finisher can greatly alter its appearance by\r\nrubbing the pores full of coloring matter. The wood is likewise\r\nsusceptible to change in tone in the fumes of ammonia, and by similar\r\ntreatment with other chemicals. The light colors of mission furniture\r\nare generally the result of treatment of that kind.\r\n\r\nThe largest cut of chestnut lumber comes from West Virginia,\r\nPennsylvania, Virginia, and Connecticut. The largest use by any single\r\nindustry is probably by the manufacturers of musical instruments, though\r\nthe honor may be divided with furniture, interior house finish, and\r\ncoffins and caskets. It is much employed as core or backing on which to\r\nglue veneers. The lumber of old, mature trees is best liked for this\r\npurpose, because it is not apt to shrink and swell, and it holds glue.\r\nIt is no detriment that it is riddled with worm holes the size of pins.\r\nThat kind of chestnut is known in the trade as “sound wormy.” Some\r\npersons claim that such lumber is better as backing for veneer than\r\nsound pieces, because it is lighter, is sufficiently strong, and the\r\nsmall holes seem to help the glue to stick. Wormy chestnut is frequently\r\nnot objected to for outside work because the small holes are not hard to\r\nfill and cover up. The uses of chestnut are many. Between 6,000,000 and\r\n7,000,000 crossties go into railroad construction yearly. From 16,000 to\r\n20,000 tons of wood are demanded annually for tanning extract. Every\r\npart of the tree is available.\r\n\r\nIn recent years a disease due to fungus has attacked chestnut forests of\r\nPennsylvania and neighboring regions. It has destroyed the timber on\r\nlarge areas, and the loss threatens to increase. A tree usually dies in\r\none or two years after it is attacked. The fungus works beneath the bark\r\nand completely girdles the tree. The spores of the fungus are believed\r\nto be carried from tree to tree on the feet of birds, on the bodies of\r\ninsects, and by the wind.\r\n\r\n    GOLDENLEAF CHINQUAPIN (_Castanopsis chrysophylla_) occurs on the\r\n    Pacific coast from the Columbia river to southern California. It is\r\n    of its largest dimensions in the coast valleys of northern\r\n    California where it occasionally attains a size equal to the\r\n    chestnut tree of the eastern states, but in many other parts of its\r\n    range it is shrubby. It is an evergreen, and its name is descriptive\r\n    of the underside of the leaf. Late in summer, flowers and fruit in\r\n    several stages of growth may be seen at the same time. The nuts are\r\n    sweet and edible. In northern California the bark is sometimes mixed\r\n    with that of tanbark oak and sold to tanneries. The wood is\r\n    considerably heavier than chestnut, and is sometimes employed in the\r\n    making of agricultural implements. It has small and obscure\r\n    medullary rays, and its pores are arranged more like those of live\r\n    oak than of chestnut; that is they run in wavy, radial lines and not\r\n    in concentric rings as in chestnut. The heartwood is darker than\r\n    chestnut.\r\n\r\n    CHINQUAPIN (_Castanea pumila_) is a little chestnut that grows from\r\n    Pennsylvania to Texas. It is generally a shrub or a bush ten or\r\n    fifteen feet high east of the Alleghany mountains, but in some of\r\n    the southern states it reaches a height of fifty feet and a diameter\r\n    of two or more, and is of largest size in southern Arkansas and\r\n    eastern Texas. It has no name but chinquapin which is an Indian word\r\n    supposed to have the same meaning that it now has. The nut is from\r\n    one-fourth to one-half as large as a chestnut, and is fully as\r\n    sweet. It is sold in the markets of the South and Southwest, but is\r\n    not an important article of commerce. Where the trees are large\r\n    enough, the wood is put to the same uses as chestnut. It is\r\n    manufactured into furniture in Texas, and is bought by railroads for\r\n    ties.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBASSWOOD\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BASSWOOD]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBASSWOOD\r\n\r\n(_Tilia Americana_)\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are about twenty species of basswood in the world, and from three\r\nto six of them are in the United States. Authors do not agree on the\r\nnumber of species in this country. There are at least three, and they\r\noccupy, in part, the same range, with consequent confusion. They are\r\nmuch alike in general appearance, and not one person in twenty knows one\r\nfrom the other. The same names apply to all, when they occur in the same\r\nregion. Few trees carry more names, and with less reason. Basswood is\r\ngenerally not difficult to identify in summer, but in winter a person\r\nonly slightly acquainted with different trees might take it for\r\ncucumber, and if of small size, it might possibly be mistaken for ash or\r\nmountain maple. When the tree is bearing leaves, flowers, and fruit,\r\nthere is no excuse for mistaking it for any other. The fruit, a cluster\r\nof four or five berry-like globes, hangs under a leaf, fixed by a short\r\nstem to the midrib. This feature alone should be sufficient to identify\r\nthe basswood in this country.\r\n\r\nAmong the many names by which this tree is known, in addition to\r\nbasswood, are American linden, linn, lynn, limetree, whitewood, beetree,\r\nblack limetree, wickup, whistle wood, and yellow basswood.\r\n\r\nThe range is extensive, its northeastern boundary lying in New\r\nBrunswick, its southwestern in Texas. It reaches Lake Winnipeg, and is\r\nfound in Georgia. This delimited area is little short of a million\r\nsquare miles. It reaches a height of from sixty to 120 feet, and a\r\ndiameter of from eighteen inches to four feet. It has a decided\r\npreference for rich soil, and the best lumber is cut in fertile coves\r\nand flats, or in low land near streams. The largest trees formerly grew\r\nin the forests of the lower Ohio valley, but few of the giants of former\r\ntimes are to be found in that region now. They went to market a\r\ngeneration or two ago. The largest cut of basswood lumber now is in\r\nWisconsin, Michigan, and West Virginia, but most of that from West\r\nVirginia is white basswood (_Tilia heterophylla_).\r\n\r\nThe wood weighs 28.20 pounds per cubic foot, which is more than the\r\nother basswoods in this country weigh. The rings of annual growth are\r\nnot very clearly marked. They may be distinguished, in most cases, by a\r\nnarrow, light-colored line. This is the springwood. In some trees it is\r\nmuch more distinct than in others. The wood is very porous, but the\r\npores are small, cannot readily be seen with the naked eye, and are\r\nscattered pretty evenly through the yearly ring. The medullary rays are\r\nsmall but numerous. They give quarter-sawed lumber a pleasing luster,\r\nbut are too minute to develop much figure. The general tone of the wood\r\nis white. It is soft, works easily, holds its shape well, and is tough,\r\nbut is in no sense a competitor of oak and hickory in toughness, though\r\nit shows the quality best in thin panels which resist splitting and\r\nbreaking.\r\n\r\nIn the days when it was customary to ceil houses with boards, both\r\noverhead and the walls of rooms, carpenters were partial to basswood\r\nbecause of its softness. Dressing lumber was then nearly always done by\r\nhand, and the carpenter who pushed the jack plane ten or twelve hours a\r\nday, looked pretty carefully to the softness of the wood he handled. In\r\ntongued and grooved work, as in ceiling and wainscoting, it was not\r\nnecessary to dress the fitting edges as carefully when basswood was used\r\nas in using some others, because it is so soft that fittings can be\r\nforced, and cracks may be closed by driving the boards together.\r\n\r\nSlack coopers have long employed basswood for barrel headings, and also\r\nin the manufacture of various kinds of small stave ware, such as pails,\r\ntubs, and kegs. In this use, as in ceiling, the softness of the wood is\r\na prime consideration, because the pressure of the hoops will close any\r\nsmall openings. Its whiteness and its freedom from stains and unpleasant\r\nodors are likewise important when vessels are to contain food products.\r\nBox makers like the wood on that account, and large quantities are\r\nmanufactured into containers for articles of food.\r\n\r\nMuch basswood is cut into veneer, some of which serves in single sheets\r\nas in making small baskets and cups for berries and small fruits, but a\r\nlarge part of the output is devoted to ply work. Usually three sheets\r\nare glued together, but sometimes there are five. By crossing the\r\nsheets, to make the grain of one lie at right angles to the next, plies\r\nof great strength and toughness are produced. Trunk makers are large\r\nusers of such, and many panels of that kind are employed by\r\nmanufacturers of furniture and musical instruments.\r\n\r\nWoodenware factories find basswood one of their most serviceable\r\nmaterials, and it is made into ironing boards, wash boards, bread\r\nboards, and cutting boards for cobblers, saddlers, and glass cutters.\r\nIts lightness and toughness make it serviceable as valves and other\r\nparts of bellows for blacksmiths, organs, and piano players. Makers of\r\ngilt picture frames prefer it for molding which is to be overlaid with\r\nthe gilt or gold. It is serviceable for advertising signs because its\r\nwhiteness contrasts well with printing. Makers of thermometers use it\r\nfrequently for the wooden body of the instrument, and yard sticks are\r\nmade of it. Apiarists find no wood more suitable for the small, light\r\nframes in which bees build the comb.\r\n\r\nThe uses of this wood are so many and so various that lists would prove\r\nmonotonous. The annual cut in this country, exclusive of veneer, is\r\nnearly 350,000,000 feet, and the demand for veneer takes many millions\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nBasswood is named for the bark, and the spelling was formerly bastwood.\r\nThe manufacture of articles from the bark was once a considerable\r\nindustry, not so much in this country as in Europe. However, some use\r\nhas been made of the bark here. Louisiana negroes make horse collars of\r\nit by braiding many strands together, and chair bottoms are woven of it\r\nin lieu of cane and rattan, and it is likewise woven into baskets of\r\ncoarse kinds. Bark is prepared for this use by soaking it in water, by\r\nwhich the annual layers of the bark are separated, long, thin sheets are\r\nproduced, and these are reduced to strips of the desired width.\r\n\r\nThe annual cut of basswood lumber is declining with no probability that\r\nit will ever again come up to past figures; but basswood is in no\r\nimmediate danger of disappearing from American forests. It is not\r\nimpossible that it may be planted for commercial purposes. In central\r\nEurope, forests of basswood, there called linden, are maintained for the\r\nhoney which bees gather from the bloom. In this country it is often\r\ncalled beetree because of the richness of its flowers in nectar.\r\nPossibly bee owners may grow forests for the honey, and when trees are\r\nmature, dispose of them for lumber.\r\n\r\n    WHITE BASSWOOD (_Tilia heterophylla_) attains a trunk diameter as\r\n    great as that of the common basswood, but is not as tall. Trees\r\n    sixty or seventy feet high are among the tallest. This species\r\n    ranges from New York to Alabama, and is found as far west as\r\n    southern Illinois, and its best development is among the rich\r\n    valleys and fertile slopes of the Appalachian mountains from\r\n    Pennsylvania southward. It is the prevailing basswood of West\r\n    Virginia, and reaches its largest size on the high mountains of\r\n    North Carolina and Tennessee. It averages about two pounds lighter\r\n    per cubic foot than the common basswood, but ordinarily neither the\r\n    lumber nor the standing trees of the two species are distinguished.\r\n    Only persons somewhat skilled in botany are able to tell one species\r\n    of basswood from another as they occur in the forests of this\r\n    country.\r\n\r\n    DOWNY BASSWOOD (_Tilia pubescens_) is a southern member of the\r\n    basswood group, and is scarce. Its range extends from North Carolina\r\n    to Arkansas and Texas. Trees are rarely more than forty feet high\r\n    and fifteen inches in diameter. The wood is light brown, tinged with\r\n    red, and the sap is hardly distinguishable from the heart. As far as\r\n    it is used at all, its uses are similar to those of other basswoods.\r\n\r\n    SOUTHERN BASSWOOD (_Tilia australis_) is confined, as far as is now\r\n    known, to a small section of Alabama, where it attains a height of\r\n    sixty feet in rich woodlands. No reports on the quality of the wood\r\n    have been published, and the species is too scarce to possess much\r\n    interest to others than systematic botanists.\r\n\r\n    FLORIDA BASSWOOD (_Tilia floridana_), as its name suggests, is a\r\n    Florida species, and has not been reported elsewhere. It seems to be\r\n    the smallest of American basswoods, the largest trees being little\r\n    more than thirty feet high. No tests of the wood have been made and\r\n    no uses reported.\r\n\r\n    MICHAUX BASSWOOD (_Tilia michauxii_) has been listed for a long\r\n    time, but is still not well known. Its range extends from Canada to\r\n    Georgia and westward to Texas. Trees three feet in diameter and\r\n    eighty feet high have been reported. Only botanists distinguish it\r\n    from other species of basswood with which it is associated.\r\n\r\n    PAWPAW (_Asimina triloba_) is of more value for its fruit than its\r\n    wood. It grows from New York to Texas, but in certain localities\r\n    only. It is the most northern species of the custard apple family,\r\n    and is usually of little importance above an altitude of 1,500 feet.\r\n    In Arkansas and some other southwestern regions it is called banana.\r\n    It is usually a shrub, but may reach a height of forty feet and a\r\n    diameter of twelve inches. The wood is light, soft, and weak. Pond\r\n    apple (_Annona glabra_), called custard apple in some parts of its\r\n    range in Florida, is a member of the same family. It attains the\r\n    size of pawpaw, and the wood is similar.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICAN HOLLY\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AMERICAN HOLLY]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICAN HOLLY\r\n\r\n(_Ilex Opaca_)\r\n\r\n\r\nHolly is a characteristic member of a large family scattered through\r\nmost temperate and tropical regions of the world. It belongs to the\r\nfamily _Aquifoliaceæ_, a name which conveys little meaning to an English\r\nreader until botanists explain that it means trees with needles on their\r\nleaves, _acus_ meaning needle, and _folium_ leaf. How well holly, with\r\nits spiny leaves, fits in that family is seen at once.\r\n\r\nAbout 175 species of holly are dispersed in various parts of the world,\r\nthe largest number occurring in Brazil and Guiana. _Ilex_ is the\r\nclassical name of the evergreen oak in southern Europe.\r\n\r\nThe glossy green foliage and the brilliant red berries of the holly tree\r\nhave long been associated in the popular mind with the Christmas season.\r\nMingled with the white berries and dull green foliage of the mistletoe,\r\nit is the chief Yuletime decoration, and many hundred trees are annually\r\nstripped of their branches to supply this demand. The growth is still\r\nquite abundant, but if the destruction and waste continue, American\r\nholly will soon be exhausted.\r\n\r\nIts range extends from Massachusetts to Texas and from Missouri to\r\nFlorida. In New England, the trees are few and small, and the same holds\r\ntrue in many parts of the Appalachian region. The largest trees are\r\nfound in southern Arkansas and eastern Texas. In the North it grows in\r\nrather dry, gravelly soil, often on the margins of oak woods, but in the\r\nSouth it takes to swamps, and does best on river bottoms where the soil\r\nis rich. It is often associated with evergreen magnolia, which it\r\nresembles at a distance, though differences are plain enough on close\r\nexamination. The light, grayish-green barks of the two trees look much\r\nalike; but the magnolia’s leaves are larger, thicker, and lack the\r\nbriers on the margins.\r\n\r\nHolly varies in size from small straggling bushes to well-formed trees\r\nfifty or sixty feet high and two or three in diameter. The principal\r\nvalue of holly is not in its wood, but in its leaves and berries. Some\r\npersons suppose that holly leaves never fall. That is true of no tree\r\nthat attains any considerable age. An examination of a holly thicket, or\r\na single tree, in the spring of the year will reveal a fair sprinkling\r\nof dead leaves on the ground, though none may be missed from the\r\nbranches. Those that fall are three years old, and they come down in the\r\nspring. There are always two full years of leaves on the trees.\r\n\r\nFlowers are the least attractive part of holly. Few people ever notice\r\nthe small, unobtrusive cymes, scattered along the base of the young\r\nshoots in the early spring, with the crop of young leaves. Nothing showy\r\nabout them attracts attention.\r\n\r\nThe fruit is the well-known berry, the glory of winter decorations. It\r\nis usually red, but sometimes yellow. The latter color is not often seen\r\nin decorations because it is a poor contrast with the glossy green of\r\nthe leaves. The berries ripen late in autumn and hang until nearly\r\nspring, provided they are let alone. That is seldom their fortune, for\r\nif they escape the wreath hunter at Christmas, they remain subject to\r\nincessant attacks by birds. Fortunately, the berries are not very choice\r\nfood for the feathered bevies that fly in winter; otherwise, the trees\r\nwould be stripped in a day or two. Birds are attracted by the color, and\r\nthey keep pecking away, taking one or two berries at a bait, and in the\r\ncourse of a long winter they get most of them.\r\n\r\nThe gathering of holly leaves and berries is an industry of much\r\nimportance, taken as a whole; but it lasts only a short time, and is\r\ncarried on without much system. The greatest source of supply is\r\nnorthern Alabama, and the neighboring parts of surrounding states; but\r\nsome holly is gathered in all regions where it is found. Those who\r\ncollect it for market make small wages, but the harvest comes at a\r\nseason when little else is doing, and the few dimes and dollars picked\r\nup are regarded as clear gain--particularly since most of the holly\r\nharvesters have no land of their own and forage for supplies on other\r\npeople’s possessions.\r\n\r\nThe seeds of holly are a long time in germinating, and those who plant\r\nthem without knowing this are apt to despair too soon. The great\r\ndifferences in the germinating habits of trees are remarkable. Some of\r\nthe maples bear seeds which sprout within a few days after they come in\r\ncontact with damp soil, certain members of the black oak group of trees\r\ndrop their acorns with sprouts already bursting the hulls, and mangroves\r\nare in a still greater hurry, and let fall their seeds with roots\r\nseveral inches long ready to penetrate the mud at once. But holly is in\r\nno hurry. Its seeds lie buried in soil until the second year before they\r\nsend their radicles into the soil. They are so slow that nurserymen\r\nusually prefer to go into the woods and dig up seedlings which are\r\nalready of plantable size.\r\n\r\nUsers of woods find many places for holly but not in large amounts. The\r\nreported output by all the sawmills in the United States in 1909 was\r\n37,000 feet, and Maryland produced more than any other state. The wood\r\nis employed for inlay work, parquetry, marquetry, small musical\r\ninstruments, and keys for pianos and organs. Engravers find it suitable\r\nfor various classes of work, its whiteness giving the principal value.\r\nIt approaches ivory in color nearer than any other American wood. Brush\r\nback manufacturers convert it into their choice wares. It is\r\noccasionally worked into small articles of furniture, but probably never\r\nis used in large pieces.\r\n\r\nThe wood is rather light, and the vague boundaries between the annual\r\nrings, and the smallness and inconspicuousness of the medullary rays,\r\nare responsible for the almost total absence of figure, no matter in\r\nwhat way the wood is worked. The so-called California holly\r\n(_Heteromeles arbutifolia_) is of a different family, and is not a\r\nholly.\r\n\r\nDAHOON HOLLY (_Ilex cassine_) grows in cold swamps and on their borders\r\nin the coast region from southern Virginia to southern Florida, and\r\nwestward to Louisiana. It is often found on the borders of pine barrens,\r\nis most common in western Florida and southern Alabama, and when at its\r\nbest, is from twenty-five to thirty feet high and a foot or more in\r\ndiameter. The leaves are nearly twice as long as those of common holly,\r\nand are generally spineless or nearly so. The fruit ripens late in\r\nautumn and hangs on the branches until the following spring. The berries\r\nare sometimes bright red, oftener dull red, and those fully up to size\r\nare a quarter of an inch in diameter. Some hang solitary, others in\r\nclusters of three. The wood is light and soft, weighing less than thirty\r\npounds per cubic foot. The heart is pale brown, and the thick sapwood\r\nnearly white. The tree is known locally as yaupon, dahoon, dahoon holly,\r\nand Henderson wood. This species passes gradually into a form designated\r\nas _Ilex myrtifolia_, which Sargent surmises may be a distinct species.\r\nAnother form, narrowleaf dahoon (_Ilex cassine angustifolia_), is listed\r\nby Sudworth.\r\n\r\nYAUPON HOLLY (_Ilex vomitoria_) is a small, much-branched tree, often\r\nshrubby, and at its best is seldom more than twenty-five feet high and\r\nsix inches in diameter. Its range follows the coast from southern\r\nVirginia to St. John’s river, Florida, and westward to eastern Texas. It\r\nsticks closely to tidewater in most parts of its habitat, but when it\r\nreaches the Mississippi valley it runs north into Arkansas. It attains\r\nits largest size in Texas, and is little more than a shrub elsewhere.\r\nBerries are produced in great abundance, are red when ripe, but they\r\nusually fall in a short time and are not much in demand for decorations.\r\nThe wood weighs over forty-five pounds per cubic foot, is hard, and\r\nnearly white, but turns yellow with exposure. The leaves of this holly\r\nwere once gathered by Indians in the southeastern states for medicine.\r\nThe savages journeyed once a year to the coast where the holly was\r\nabundant, boiled the leaves in water, and produced what they called the\r\n“black drink.” It was nauseating in the extreme, but they drank copious\r\ndraughts of it during several days, then departed for their homes,\r\nconfident that good health was assured for another year.\r\n\r\n    MOUNTAIN HOLLY (_Ilex monticola_) is so named because it grows among\r\n    the Appalachian ranges from New York to Alabama. It is best\r\n    developed in the elevated district where Tennessee and North and\r\n    South Carolina meet near one common boundary. It is elsewhere\r\n    shrubby. The leaves are deciduous, and the bright scarlet berries\r\n    are nearly as large as cherries. They fall too early to make them\r\n    acceptable as Christmas decorations. The wood is hard, heavy, and\r\n    creamy-white, and if it could be had in adequate quantities, would\r\n    be valuable. The trees are sometimes a foot in diameter and forty\r\n    feet high, but they are not abundant. Their leaves bear small\r\n    resemblance to the typical holly leaf, but look more like those of\r\n    cherry or plum.\r\n\r\n    DECIDUOUS HOLLY (_Ilex decidua_) is called bearberry in Mississippi\r\n    and possum haw in Florida, while in other regions it is known as\r\n    swamp holly because of its habit of clinging to the banks of streams\r\n    and betaking itself to swamps. It keeps away from mountains, though\r\n    it is found in a shrubby form between the Blue Ridge and the sea in\r\n    the Atlantic states, from Virginia southward. It runs west through\r\n    the Gulf region to Texas, and ascends the Mississippi valley to\r\n    Illinois and Missouri, attaining tree size only west of the\r\n    Mississippi. The wood is as heavy as white oak, hard, and\r\n    creamy-white, both heart and sap. Doubtless small quantities are\r\n    employed in different industries, but the only direct report of its\r\n    use comes from Texas where it is turned for drawer and door knobs in\r\n    furniture factories. Most but not all of the leaves fall in early\r\n    winter. The berries obey the same rule, some fall and others hang\r\n    till spring. They are orange or orange-scarlet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYELLOW BUCKEYE\r\n\r\n[Illustration: YELLOW BUCKEYE]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYELLOW BUCKEYE\r\n\r\n(_Æsculus Octandra_)\r\n\r\n\r\nFour species and one variety of buckeye are native in the United States,\r\nyellow buckeye, Ohio buckeye, California buckeye, small buckeye, and\r\npurple buckeye. They belong in the horse chestnut family. The so-called\r\nTexas buckeye is in a different family, and is not a true buckeye, but\r\nis close kin to the soapberry. The buckeyes are named for the large\r\nwhite spot on the smooth, brown nut, resembling the eye of a deer. The\r\nyellow buckeye is the most important of the group, is the largest and\r\nmost abundant. It is known by the name of buckeye in North Carolina,\r\nSouth Carolina, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, and Kentucky. It\r\nis called sweet buckeye in West Virginia, Mississippi, Texas, Missouri,\r\nand Indiana, probably owing to the fact that it does not exhale the\r\ndisagreeable odor characteristic of other members of the family. Yellow\r\nbuckeye is the term applied to it in South Carolina and Alabama; large\r\nbuckeye in Tennessee; big buckeye in Tennessee and Texas. It flourishes\r\nfrom Allegheny county, Pennsylvania, southward along the Alleghany\r\nmountains to northern Georgia and Alabama, westward along the valley of\r\nthe Ohio river to southern Iowa, through Oklahoma and the valley of the\r\nBrazos river in eastern Texas. It thrives best along streams and in\r\ndense, rich woods. It reaches its fullest development on the slopes of\r\nthe Alleghany mountains in North Carolina and Tennessee.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of the buckeye are compound, with from five to seven\r\nleaflets; flowers appear in May or June and are dull yellow; the fruit\r\nis a large brown nut, one or two of which are enclosed in a rough,\r\nuneven husk, about two inches or more in diameter. The tree grows from\r\nforty to 100 feet in height, and attains a diameter of from one to three\r\nand a half feet.\r\n\r\nBuckeye grows intermingled with poplar, oak, maple, beech and a variety\r\nof other hardwoods. From its comparatively limited growth as compared\r\nwith the totality of the average hardwood forest, it never has been\r\nrecognized, and probably never will be, as a distinctive type of\r\nAmerican commercial wood. The timber is felled with the other valuable\r\ntrees surrounding it, and its appearance, when manufactured into lumber\r\nis so similar to that of the sap of poplar or whitewood that almost\r\nwithout exception it is assorted with poplar saps, and goes on the\r\nmarket masquerading as that wood. There is probably not one lumberman in\r\na thousand, handling poplar, that is able to distinguish buckeye from\r\nsap poplar in his shipments of that wood.\r\n\r\nSawmills make no distinction between the different species. All that\r\ncomes is buckeye, but nearly all of it is the yellow species, though\r\ndoubtless a little of all the others is cut into lumber and veneer, or\r\ngoes to the slack cooperage shop, or to the pulp mill. The woods of all\r\nare quite similar, and they are used for the same purposes. If one is\r\nemployed in larger quantities than another, it is because it is more\r\nconvenient, or of better form or larger size.\r\n\r\nEarly uses of buckeye were as important as those of the present day,\r\nthough amounts were smaller. Many an Ohio statesman of former times\r\nboasted that, as a baby, he was rocked in a buckeye sugar trough for a\r\ncradle. They claimed with pride that the prevalance of the custom caused\r\nOhio to be known as the buckeye state, a name which clings to it still.\r\nNext to yellow poplar, buckeye was considered the best wood from which\r\nto hew the small troughs which collected the sugar water from the tapped\r\nmaples in early spring; but the range of buckeye did not extend\r\nnorthward into the real maple area, and the troughs like those which\r\nrocked the inchoate Ohio statesmen were unknown in the North, but were\r\nfamiliar along the mountain ranges southward. Dough trays, bread boards,\r\nchopping bowls, and troughs in which to salt bacon and pork, were hewed\r\nfrom buckeye by farmers and village woodworkers.\r\n\r\nIt weighs 27.24 pounds per cubic foot; is diffuse-porous, and the slight\r\ndifference between the wood grown in spring and that of late summer\r\nrenders the annual rings indistinct. It has little figure, no matter how\r\nit is sawed; medullary rays are thin and obscure. Softness is one of the\r\nprincipal qualities, and it is also weak, and is wanting in rigidity.\r\nThese are its faults, but it has virtues. It is tasteless and odorless,\r\nand these properties make it valuable in the manufacture of boxes in\r\nwhich food products are shipped. The reported cut of buckeye in the\r\nUnited States is from 11,000,000 to 13,000,000 feet a year. The reports\r\nof factories which use the wood in making commodities throw light on the\r\nquestion of actual use. North Carolina works 10,000 feet a year into\r\ncabinets and office fixtures; Michigan 100,000 into candy and chocolate\r\nboxes, dishes, and bowls; Maryland uses 200,000 feet yearly for\r\npractically the same purposes, but with the added commodities of spice\r\ndrawers and tea chests. Makers of artificial limbs consider buckeye one\r\nof their best materials, but it is second to willow. The “cork legs” are\r\nusually either buckeye or willow. Pulp mills grind the wood for paper,\r\nbut it is not separately listed in pulp statistics, and the total cut\r\ncannot be stated. It is converted into veneer and finds many places of\r\nusefulness, but here, also, no separate figures are to be had.\r\n\r\nThe nuts are large and abundant, but almost wholly useless for man or\r\nbeast. Bookbinders make paste of them, as a substitute for flour, and\r\nwith satisfactory results. The paste resists ferments much better than\r\nthat manufactured from flour; but the demand upon the nut supply for\r\nthat purpose is very small. Squirrels and other small animals leave\r\nbuckeyes alone. Some writers, whose acquaintance with this tree was\r\napparently acquired at long range, state that the nuts are food for\r\ncattle. No person with knowledge of the buckeye says that. Cattle\r\noccasionally eat a few, but are poisoned thereby, and if they recover,\r\nthey never again have anything to do with buckeyes.\r\n\r\nThis tree is ornamental during a few months of the year. Its flowers are\r\nattractive, and its large, vigorous leaves and conspicuous fruit are\r\nadmired in summer; but early in the fall the leaves come down, the husks\r\nburst from the nuts and strew the ground with unsightly fragments. The\r\ntree is seldom planted, but the horse chestnut, a foreign species, takes\r\nits place.\r\n\r\nOHIO BUCKEYE (_Æsculus glabra_) was once thought to be more abundant in\r\nOhio than elsewhere, hence the name; but its best development is in\r\nTennessee and northern Alabama. The disagreeable odor emitted by the\r\nbark gives it the names fetid and stinking buckeye, and it is known also\r\nas American horse chestnut. Its range is approximately the same as that\r\nof yellow buckeye, but it is a smaller tree, rarely more than thirty\r\nfeet high, though it is seventy in exceptional cases. In common with\r\nother trees of the species, it prefers rich soil along water courses.\r\nThe wood was formerly in demand for chip hats, but that use has\r\napparently ceased. The sapwood is darker than the heart which is an\r\nexception to the general rule. Dark streaks, probably stains due to\r\nfungus, occasionally run through the trunk. In weight, strength, and\r\nstiffness the wood is approximately the same as yellow buckeye. Its odor\r\nis sufficient to distinguish it from that species, and it associates\r\nwith no other except on rare occasions when it may be found with the\r\nsmall buckeye in western Tennessee and southern Missouri.\r\n\r\nCALIFORNIA BUCKEYE (_Æsculus californica_) occurs only in the state\r\nwhose name it bears. It is a short, much-branched, ill-formed tree; root\r\nlarge and shaped somewhat like an inverted tub, often standing a foot or\r\nmore above the ground, and the branches rising from it. A tree so formed\r\nis without value to the general lumberman, but cabinet makers sometimes\r\ngrub out the root and saw it transversely into thin lumber or veneer and\r\nmake small articles which possess considerable figure, due to the\r\ninvolved growth, but little variety of color. Its tone is light yellow.\r\nThe tree is found in the central part of California, from near sea level\r\nup to 4,500 in the Sierra Nevadas. It gets away from the immediate\r\nvicinity of water courses and grows on hillsides. It is heavier than any\r\nother American buckeye, and has very thin sapwood. The other properties\r\nof the wood, and the botanical characters of the tree are common to\r\nother members of the species. The seeds depend for their dispersal on\r\nrunning water, when the tree grows by a stream, or on gravity, if\r\nsituated on a hillside. The seed will not grow unless buried in moist\r\nsoil, and it retains its vitality only a few months. Few trees in the\r\nUnited States have larger seeds than buckeyes. The tree is short-lived,\r\nreaching maturity in most cases in less than a hundred years. It is\r\nsometimes planted for ornament in this country and in Europe.\r\n\r\nSMALL BUCKEYE (_Æsculus austrina_) is one of the latest recognized\r\nmembers of the buckeye household. It seldom attains a diameter above\r\nfive or six inches, or a height of twenty-five feet. It is, therefore,\r\ntoo small to be seriously considered as a source of lumber, and even if\r\ntrunks were large enough, the species is too scarce to furnish many\r\nlogs. It grows on rich uplands from western Tennessee and southern\r\nMissouri to Texas. The bright red flowers open in April, the fruit falls\r\nin October.\r\n\r\nPURPLE BUCKEYE (_Æsculus octandra hybrida_) is a variety characterized\r\nby red or purple flowers and by leaves woolly on the under sides, and\r\nbark of lighter color than that of yellow buckeye. The range follows the\r\nAppalachian mountains from West Virginia southward. It has been reported\r\nin Texas also. If the wood is used at all, it goes for the same purposes\r\nas yellow buckeye.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSASSAFRAS\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SASSAFRAS]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSASSAFRAS\r\n\r\n(_Sassafras Sassafras_)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe French settlers in Florida were the first white men to give the name\r\nsassafras to this tree, but the Indians called it by that name long\r\nbefore. It was a tree which Indians were sure to name, because it had an\r\nindividuality which appealed to them. It is not known what the real\r\nmeaning of the word was, when the southern Indians used it. After the\r\nFrench adopted the name in Florida, it passed to other colonies and\r\nother languages, and has led to numerous disputes since. Many have\r\nerroneously supposed that the name is of Latin origin. When the English\r\ncolony was founded at Jamestown, Virginia, in 1607, the tree was well\r\nknown by that name, but it was pronounced so variously and spelled in so\r\nmany ways that it was often almost unrecognizable. It is pronounced\r\nvariously and spelled differently yet. It is called sassafras in most\r\nregions, and in others is saxifrax, sassafas, sassafac, sassafrac, and\r\nsaxifrax tree.\r\n\r\nIts range covers the territory from Massachusetts to Iowa and Kansas,\r\nand south to Florida and Texas. Some of that range it has occupied for\r\nvast periods of time, for sassafras leaves have been found embedded in\r\nthe Cretaceous formations of Long Island. Near the northern limit of its\r\nrange it is generally small, often of brush size; but further south it\r\nbecomes a tree which sometimes exceeds 100 feet in height, and three or\r\nfour in diameter. The best development of the species is in Arkansas and\r\nMissouri.\r\n\r\nSassafras belongs to the laurel family. Strangely enough, the two trees\r\nwhich are usually supposed to be typical laurels--namely, mountain\r\nlaurel (_Kalmia latifolia_) and great rhododendron, do not belong to the\r\nlaurel family, but the heath family. The laurel family to which\r\nsassafras belongs includes many species in all parts of the world, some\r\nare evergreen, others are not, but all characterized by the strong,\r\npungent odor of their wood or bark, and all having fruit with a single\r\nseed like a plum or cherry. The camphor tree from the distillation of\r\nwhose wood commercial camphor (except synthetic camphor made largely\r\nfrom turpentine) is derived, belongs to this family, as do certain bay\r\ntrees of the southern states. It was formerly supposed that sassafras\r\nexisted only in the eastern half of the United States; but a species\r\nclosely resembling ours, if not identical with it, has recently been\r\nfound in China. The California laurel (_Umbellularia californica_) is in\r\nthe same family with sassafras.\r\n\r\nThis tree has had a peculiar history. It was once supposed to possess\r\nmiraculous healing powers, and was shipped from Virginia to England in\r\none of the first cargoes to go to that country from the present\r\nterritory of the United States. Its supposed value did not consist in\r\nits use as lumber, but in some medicinal property which it was reputed\r\nto possess. People appeared to believe that it would renew the youth of\r\nthe human race. Some portion of this superstition has clung round\r\nsassafras to this day, and it is not entirely confined to ignorant\r\npeople. Bedsteads made of sassafras were supposed to drive away certain\r\nnightly visitors which disturb slumber. In southeastern Arkansas and\r\nnorthwestern Mississippi, bedsteads are still made of this wood, with\r\nthe belief that sleep will be sounder. The same custom doubtless\r\nprevails elsewhere. In northern Louisiana floors of sassafras are\r\noccasionally laid in negro cabins because of the same superstition, and\r\nin the firm belief that it will keep out animals as large as rats and\r\nmice. Some of the mountaineers of Kentucky, where each family makes its\r\nown soap, insist that the kettle must be stirred with a sassafras stick\r\nor it will produce a poor quality of soap. Among the mountains of West\r\nVirginia many a farmer equips his henhouse with sassafras poles for\r\nroosts, fully convinced that he has put an effective quietus on all\r\ntribes, shoals, and kindred of _menopon pallidum_, and the hens will\r\nsleep better.\r\n\r\nThe production of sassafras oil is perhaps the largest industry\r\ndependent upon this tree. Roots are grubbed by the ton and are subjected\r\nto destructive distillation. Much of this work is carried on in Virginia\r\nwhere sassafras spreads quickly into abandoned fields, springing up from\r\nseeds carried by birds. Veritable thickets soon take possession. Here is\r\nwhere the sassafras oil supply comes from. Contractors often clear the\r\nold fields and make them ready for tillage, taking the roots for pay.\r\n\r\nThe wood weighs 31.42 pounds per cubic foot; is very durable when\r\nexposed to dampness; is slightly aromatic; inclined to check in drying;\r\nthe layers of annual growth are marked by rings of large pores;\r\nsummerwood is quite distinct from the earlier growth; medullary rays are\r\nmany and thin; color dull orange-brown, the thin sapwood light yellow.\r\n\r\nSassafras goes to sawmills in all regions where it is large enough for\r\nlumber, but the total cut is small. Reports from sawmills in 1909\r\ncredited this species with only 25,000 feet in the United States, and it\r\nwas still less in 1910. It is evident that this is only a small portion\r\nof the total output, and probably Tennessee alone produces that much.\r\nThe wood is sold with other species and loses its name, frequently\r\npassing as ash. The wood bears considerable resemblance to ash, in grain\r\nand color, but is lighter in weight, and much lower in strength.\r\n\r\nSassafras was one of the canoe woods of early times along the lower\r\nMississippi and its tributaries. Its two principal advantages over most\r\nwoods with which it was associated was its light weight and lasting\r\nqualities. Canoes of this timber in Louisiana have given continued\r\nservice for a third of a century.\r\n\r\nIn all parts of its range, wherever it is of sufficient size, it has\r\nbeen used for posts. It is generally considered good for about twenty\r\nyears. Large trunks were formerly split for rails, and a few are\r\nutilized in that way still, but most timber large enough for rails, now\r\ngoes to sawmills. In Texas most of the sassafras supplied by sawmills is\r\nmanufactured into furniture, but is listed as ash. The same thing is\r\ndone in Arkansas and Missouri, but the use in the latter state is\r\nextended to interior house finish and office and bank fixtures.\r\nSometimes it is made the outside wood, and the figure caused by sawing\r\nthe logs tangentially is accentuated by stains and fillers. The figure\r\nof quarter-sawed wood is not attractive because the medullary rays are\r\ntoo small. It lasts well as railroad ties and a few are found in service\r\nin many parts of the tree’s range, but those who see it in the track are\r\nliable to mistake it for chestnut.\r\n\r\nA by-product of sassafras deserves mention--tea made from the flowers or\r\nfrom the bark of the roots. It is relished in the early spring, and is\r\npopular in most regions where the tree is known. The bark is a\r\ncommercial commodity. It is tied in small bundles, and the price at\r\nretail ranges from a nickel to a dime each. Drug stores and grocers sell\r\nit. In the city of Washington in early spring sassafras peddlers canvas\r\nthe city from center to circumference. They are generally negro men and\r\nwomen who dig the roots on the neighboring hills of Virginia and\r\nMaryland, strip the bark, tie it in small bundles, and by diligence and\r\nperseverance, succeed in converting the merchandise into money.\r\n\r\nSassafras is often cited as an example of a tree with leaves of\r\ndifferent forms. Three shapes are common, and all frequently occur on\r\nthe same tree, and even on the same twig. One has no lobes, another has\r\none lobe like the thumb of a mitten, and another has three.\r\n\r\nLANCEWOOD (_Ocotea catesbyana_) is a small evergreen tree, looks much\r\nlike laurel, and grows in southern Florida, on the islands and on the\r\nmainland in the vicinity of Biscayne bay. It is closely related to\r\nsassafras, and the bark has an aromatic odor. It belongs to a group of\r\ntrees with nearly 200 species scattered in hot regions of both\r\nhemispheres. This is the only one belonging to the United States, and it\r\nappears to be a newcomer on these shores, from the fact that it has\r\nsucceeded in obtaining so limited a foothold. It keeps well south of the\r\nregion where it is likely to be frosted and it seldom exceeds a height\r\nof thirty feet and a diameter of eighteen inches. The fruit ripens in\r\nautumn and is dark blue with flesh thin and dry. The wood is hard,\r\nheavy, strong, checks badly in drying, and has a rich brown color, the\r\nsapwood being yellow. Rings of annual growth are marked with many small,\r\nregularly-distributed open ducts; medullary rays are thin and numerous;\r\nwood weighs 47.94 pounds per cubic foot; durable in contact with the\r\nsoil, beautifully colored, and is highly prized for small cabinet work\r\nand novelties. At Miami, Florida, small trunks cut on neighboring\r\nhummocks, or brought from the keys, are worked into souvenirs to be sold\r\nto visitors. Lancewood fishing rods are among the strongest and most\r\nexpensive on the market; but little of the material of which they are\r\nmade grows in Florida. It is also manufactured into billiard cues and\r\nsmall handles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMADRONA\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MADRONA]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMADRONA\r\n\r\n(_Arbutus Menziesii_)\r\n\r\n\r\nMadrona is an interesting tree which ranges from British Columbia\r\nsouthward to central California, attaining its greatest development in\r\nthe redwood forests of northern California, where trees are sometimes\r\none hundred feet high and six or seven feet in diameter. It is not only\r\nan interesting tree itself, but it has many interesting relatives, some\r\nof which are trees, others shrubs, and still others only small plants or\r\nvines. It may be called a second cousin to the common huckleberry, the\r\nmountain laurel, trailing arbutus, the azaleas, the tiny wintergreen,\r\nand the great rhododendron. It has some poor relations, but many that\r\nare highly respectable. It belongs to the heath family, of which there\r\nare seventy genera, and more than a thousand species; but less than half\r\nof them are in America, the others being scattered widely over the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nThe madrona, when at its best, is one of the largest members of the\r\nfamily; but it is not always at its best. It sometimes degenerates into\r\na sprawling shrub, where it grows on poor ground and on cold, dry\r\nmountain tops. It is manifestly not fair to study any tree at its worst,\r\nand it is particularly not fair to the madrona, which varies so greatly\r\nin its appearance. At one place it may be scarcely large enough to shade\r\nthe lair of a jackrabbit, and at another it spreads its branches wide\r\nenough to shade an army--a small army, however, say, about two thousand\r\nmen. A tree of that size may be found within a few hours’ ride of San\r\nFrancisco. Its branches cover an area of from eight thousand to ten\r\nthousand square feet.\r\n\r\nWhen madrona grows in the open it throws out wide limbs like a southern\r\nlive oak, though not so large or long. Its crown is rounded and\r\ngraceful; but when it grows in forests, where other trees crowd it, the\r\ntrunk rises straight up to lift the crown into the sunlight and fresh\r\nair. The madrona is seen in all its glory in northwestern California,\r\nwhere it catches some of the warmth and the moist air from the Pacific.\r\nIt follows the ranges of the Siskiyou mountains eastward near the\r\nboundary of California and Oregon. It is usually mixed with other forest\r\ntrees, but sometimes large stands nearly pure are encountered, and there\r\nthe long trunks, rather gray near the ground, but wine-colored above,\r\nrise in imposing beauty and are lost in the evergreen crowns.\r\n\r\nThe leaves suggest those of laurel, but are broader. The large clusters\r\nof white flowers are among the glories of the vegetable kingdom. George\r\nB. Sudworth, dendrologist of the United States Forest Service, who\r\nusually describes in strictly prosaic terms, breaks away from that habit\r\nlong enough to compare madrona flowers to lilies of the valley, in his\r\n“Forest Trees of the Pacific Slope.” The flowers appear from March to\r\nMay, depending on latitude and elevation.\r\n\r\nThe brilliant orange-red fruit ripens in the fall, and is often borne in\r\ngreat abundance. It renders the crowns of the trees very beautiful. The\r\nfruit is about half an inch long and contains many small angular seeds.\r\nThe fruit is said to contain a substance which puts to sleep wild\r\ncreatures that feed on it. The claim is probably mythical, for birds\r\nbreakfast extravagantly on it in the morning, and apparently do not do\r\nany sleeping until after sunset.\r\n\r\nThis tree was discovered by and named for Archibald Menzies, a Scotch\r\nbotanist who traveled in the Northwest more than a hundred years ago. It\r\nhas several local names, among them being madrove, laurel wood,\r\nmadrone-tree, laurel, and manzanita. The last is the proper name of\r\nanother small tree which is associated with madrona and is closely\r\nrelated to it.\r\n\r\nThe wood weighs 43.95 pounds per cubic foot. It is a little below\r\neastern white oak in fuel value, a little above it in strength, and\r\nsomewhat under it in stiffness. The color is pale reddish-brown,\r\nresembling applewood in tone, but generally not quite so dark. The wood\r\nis porous, but the pores are very small. Medullary rays are numerous but\r\nthin. On account of the rays being of a little deeper red than the other\r\nwood, quarter-sawed stock is handsome and of somewhat peculiar\r\nappearance. The figure is much like quarter-sawed beech, but of deeper,\r\nmore handsome color. The contrast between springwood and summerwood is\r\nnot strong, though easily seen. Generally, the summerwood constitutes\r\nabout one-fourth of the annual ring. The tree grows slowly, but with\r\nmuch irregularity. The increase in one season may be four or five times\r\nas great as in another. The bark exfoliates, and is quite thin.\r\n\r\nMadrona has never been put to much use. Difficulties in seasoning it\r\nhave stood in the way. The wood warps and checks. Similar difficulties\r\nwith other woods have been overcome, and such troubles should not be\r\nunduly discouraging. The beauty of the wood is unquestioned. It presents\r\na fine appearance when worked into furniture, particularly in small\r\npanels and turned work, like spindles, knobs, and small posts. When made\r\ninto grills it shows a surprising richness of tone. The wood polishes\r\nalmost to the smoothness of holly. Small quantities are made into\r\nflooring; a little goes to the furniture makers; lathes turn some of it\r\nfor novelties and souvenirs; fuel cutters sell it as cordwood; and\r\ntanbark peelers cut the trees for the thin, papery bark. In that case\r\nthe trunks are left to decay, unless they happen to be convenient to a\r\ncordwood market.\r\n\r\nOne of the most extensive uses for the wood of madrona is for charcoal\r\nburning. Blacksmiths buy it because it is cheaper than coal, and some is\r\nused in shops where soldering and welding are done; but the most\r\nexacting demand comes from gunpowder manufacturers. They find this wood\r\nalmost equal to alder and willow as a source of charcoal suitable for\r\npowder.\r\n\r\nMEXICAN MADRONA (_Arbutus xalapensis_) might properly be called Texas\r\nmadrona as it occurs in that state and probably in no other, but its\r\nrange extends southward into Mexico. It produces a poorly shaped trunk\r\nseldom much more than twenty feet high and one foot in diameter, and\r\nusually divided into several branches near the ground. It blooms in\r\nMarch and ripens its fruit in midsummer. The tree is found on dry\r\nlimestone hills, and in the valley of the Rio Blanco, and among the\r\nEagle mountains. Cabinet makers in Texas put the wood to rather exacting\r\nuses after they have carefully seasoned it to overcome its natural\r\ntendency to check. It is very hard; its color is a little lighter than\r\napplewood which it resembles; annual rings are scarcely visible, so\r\nregular and even is the year’s growth. In Texas the wood is made into\r\nplane stocks, tool handles, and mathematical instruments.\r\n\r\nARIZONA MADRONA (_Arbutus arizonica_) has a restricted range on the\r\nSanta Catalina and Santa Rita mountains of southern Arizona, where it\r\nascends to an altitude of 8,000 feet. The species extends southward into\r\nMexico. The largest trees attain a height of fifty feet and a diameter\r\nof two. Trunks are usually straight and shapely, and show the thin, red\r\nbark common to the genus. The wood resembles that of the species in\r\nTexas, and doubtless is suited to the same purposes, but no utilization\r\nof it has been reported, except for fuel, and for fences and sheds on\r\nmountain ranches. When the region becomes more thickly settled, the\r\nvalue of the wood will be appreciated.\r\n\r\n    MANZANITA (_Arctostaphylos manzanita_) is not generally welcomed by\r\n    botanists into the tree class. They say it is too small; but it is\r\n    as large as some of the laurels which go as trees without question,\r\n    and is shaped much like them. There are several species of\r\n    manzanita. The word is Spanish and means “little apple.” The name is\r\n    natural, for one of the most noticeable things about manzanita is\r\n    the fruit, the size of well-grown huckleberries. It is shaped like\r\n    an apple, and its tart taste suggests that fruit. The Digger Indians\r\n    along the foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountains in California\r\n    gather the berries by the sack, dry them, and keep them for\r\n    winter--if they can. It is often impossible to keep them because,\r\n    like other fruit, they are apt to become wormy. When the Indians\r\n    discover them in that condition they display rare thrift and economy\r\n    for savages, by soaking the fruit and pressing out the juice, which\r\n    is said to pass for a pretty fair quality of cider, but it must be\r\n    quickly consumed or it will mother and change to vinegar. Indians\r\n    now put the berries to use less frequently than in early times when\r\n    they were nearly always hungry.\r\n\r\n    Manzanita is of the same family as madrona. Its range extends along\r\n    the mountains of the Pacific coast ranges from Oregon to Mexico, and\r\n    inland to Utah. The largest trees are about twenty feet high and a\r\n    foot or less in diameter; very much divided and branched, with limbs\r\n    crooked in more ways, perhaps, than those of any other\r\n    representative of the vegetable kingdom. Thousands of canes are cut\r\n    from the branches, and if any living man ever saw a straight one he\r\n    failed to report it. Manzanita grows in almost impenetrable thickets\r\n    on dry slopes and ridges. Its thin foliage casts so pale a shadow\r\n    that the tree’s shade is little cooler than the boiling sun upon the\r\n    open naked ground and rocks. The bark is a reddish-chocolate color,\r\n    and exfoliates in scales of papery thinness. The heart is nearly of\r\n    the same color as the bark, but the sap is white and very thin. The\r\n    wood is hard, strong, stiff, but exceedingly brittle. If a branch is\r\n    sharply bent it will fly into splinters.\r\n\r\n    The uses of the wood are numerous, but the total quantity demanded\r\n    is moderate. Novelty stores sell small articles to tourists in\r\n    California, sometimes passing the wood off as mountain mahogany\r\n    which does not so much as belong to the same family. The most common\r\n    articles manufactured by novelty shops from manzanita are canes,\r\n    paper weights, paper knives, rulers, spoons, napkin rings, curtain\r\n    rings, cuff buttons, dominos, manicure sticks, jewel boxes, match\r\n    safes, pin trays, and photo frames.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOTTONWOOD\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COTTONWOOD]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOTTONWOOD[9]\r\n\r\n(_Populus Deltoides_)\r\n\r\n    [9] The following species grow in the United States: Cottonwood\r\n    (_Populus deltoides_), Aspen (_Populus tremuloides_), Largetooth\r\n    aspen (_Populus grandidentata_), Swamp Cottonwood (_Populus\r\n    heterophylla_), Balm of Gilead (_Populus balsamifera_), Lanceleaf\r\n    Cottonwood (_Populus acuminata_), Narrowleaf Cottonwood (_Populus\r\n    angustifolia_), Black Cottonwood (_Populus trichocarpa_), Fremont\r\n    Cottonwood (_Populus fremontii_), Mexican Cottonwood (_Populus\r\n    mexicana_), Texas Cottonwood (_Populus wislizeni_).\r\n\r\n\r\nEleven species of cottonwood are found in the United States, if all\r\ntrees of the genus _Populus_ are classed as cottonwoods. It is not\r\nuniversally admitted, however, that they should be so classed. The\r\ncommon cottonwood is the most widely known of all of them, but it is\r\nrecognized under different names in different regions, viz.: Big\r\ncottonwood, yellow cottonwood, cotton tree, Carolina poplar, necklace\r\npoplar, broadleaf poplar, and whitewood.\r\n\r\nIts range covers practically all of the United States east of the Rocky\r\nMountains. It is rare or missing in eastern New England and southern\r\nFlorida, and most abundant in the Mississippi valley, and there the\r\nlargest trees are found. Some exceed 100 feet in height, and four in\r\ndiameter. Extreme sizes of 140 feet in height with diameters of from\r\nseven to nine have been reported. The cottonwood was a frontier tree on\r\nthe western plains when settlers began to push into the region. It grew\r\nas far west as any hardwood of the eastern forests, and was found beyond\r\nmeridian 100, which was supposed to be the boundary between the region\r\nof rains and the semi-arid country. The cottonwood clung to the river\r\nbanks and to islands in the rivers, and by that means escaped the\r\nIndian’s prairie and forest fires which he kindled every year to improve\r\nthe range for the buffalo. It is supposed that most of the open country\r\neast of meridian 100 was originally timbered, and that the Indians\r\ndestroyed the forests by their long-continued habit of burning the woods\r\nand prairies every year to improve the pasture. Cottonwood was the\r\nlongest survivor, because it grew in damp places where fires did not\r\nburn fiercely. Black willow was its most frequent companion on the\r\nwestern outposts of the forests.\r\n\r\nThe cottonwood was fitted for holding its ground, and pushing forward.\r\nIts light seeds are carried by millions on the wind and by water. The\r\ntree bears large quantities of cotton (hence the name), and when the\r\nwind whips it from the tree, seeds are caught among the fibers and\r\ncarried along, to be scattered miles away.\r\n\r\nThis tree was not much thought of by eastern people who had plenty of\r\nother kinds of wood, but pioneers on the plains who had a hard time to\r\nget any, found cottonwood useful. It made fences, corncribs, stables,\r\ncabins, ox yokes, and fuel. The first canoes made by white men on the\r\nupper Missouri river were of cottonwood. Lumber cut from this tree is\r\ninclined to warp and check unless carefully handled, and this prejudiced\r\nit in the eyes of many; but difficulties of that kind were easily\r\nmastered, and instead of being a neglected wood it became popular. Some\r\nof the largest early orders came from Germany. Vehicle makers in this\r\ncountry employed it for wagon beds, as a substitute for yellow poplar\r\nwhen that wood’s cost advanced. Manufacturers of agricultural implements\r\nwere pioneers in its use, it being excellent material for hoppers,\r\nchutes, and boxes.\r\n\r\nCottonwood weighs 24.24 pounds per cubic foot, which is approximately\r\nthe weight of white pine. It has about the stiffness of white oak, but\r\nonly about eighty per cent of white oak’s strength, and fifty per cent\r\nof its fuel value. The wood is very porous, but the pores are small,\r\nusually invisible to the naked eye. The medullary rays are small and\r\nobscure. The appearance of the wood is not improved by quarter-sawing.\r\nThe summerwood forms a thin, dark line, so faint that the annual rings\r\nare often scarcely distinguishable. The tree is generally a rapid\r\ngrower; heartwood is brown, sapwood lighter, but as a whole, this tree\r\nproduces white wood.\r\n\r\nThe annual cut is declining. It was little more than half in 1910 what\r\nit was in 1899. Some regions where large trees were once abundant now\r\nhave few. The sawmill output in 1910 for the United States--including\r\nseveral species--was 220,000,000 feet. The veneer cut was 33,000,000\r\nfeet, log measure; the slack cooperage staves, chiefly for flour\r\nbarrels, numbered 44,000,000; and pulpwood amounted to about 18,000,000\r\nfeet. The lumber cut was largest in the following states in the order\r\nnamed: Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Tennessee, Iowa,\r\nWisconsin, Michigan, Oklahoma, and Minnesota. The tree was lumbered in\r\nforty-one states.\r\n\r\nCottonwood is a standard material in several lines of manufacturing. It\r\nis made into nearly every kind of box that goes on the market, from the\r\ncigar box to those in which pianos are shipped. Manufacturers of food\r\nproducts are particularly anxious to procure this wood, and it is one of\r\nthe best for woodenware, such as dough boards, ironing boards, and cloth\r\nboards. It is used by manufacturers of agricultural implements, interior\r\nfinish, bank and office fixtures, musical instruments, furniture,\r\nvehicle tops, trunks, excelsior, saddle trees, caskets and coffins, and\r\nnumerous others.\r\n\r\nThere is no danger that cottonwood will disappear from this country, but\r\nit will become scarce. It is being cut much faster than it is growing,\r\nand is losing favor as a planted shade and park tree, because of its\r\nhabit of shedding cotton in the spring and its leaves in the early\r\nautumn.\r\n\r\nSWAMP COTTONWOOD (_Populus heterophylla_) is known also as river\r\ncottonwood, black cottonwood, downy poplar, and swamp poplar. Its range\r\ndescribes a crude horseshoe, running from Rhode Island down the Atlantic\r\ncoast in a narrow strip, where it is neither abundant nor of large size;\r\ntouching northern Florida; running westward to eastern Texas and thence\r\nup the Mississippi basin and the Ohio river to southwestern Ohio. There\r\nis nothing handsome about its appearance with its heavy limbs and\r\nsparse, rounded crown. In the eastern range the average height is\r\nprobably not more than fifty feet but in the fertile Mississippi valley\r\nit reaches 100 and has a long merchantable bole three feet in diameter.\r\nIts bark is rugged, dirty-brown and broken into loose, conspicuous\r\nridges. It is easily distinguished from the other cottonwoods by the\r\norange-colored pith in the twigs. The buds are rounded and red and have\r\na resinous odor. Sawmills and factories never list this wood separately.\r\nIt comes and goes as cottonwood. Its uses are the same as those of\r\ncommon cottonwood. The two species grow in mixture throughout the entire\r\nrange of the swamp cottonwood.\r\n\r\nTEXAS COTTONWOOD (_Populus wislizeni_) is a rather large tree and is the\r\ncommon cottonwood in the upper valley of the Rio Grande in New Mexico\r\nand western Texas. The yellowish color of the twigs is apt to attract\r\nattention. The wood is used about ranches and occasionally a log finds\r\nits way to local sawmills; but its importance is limited to the region\r\nwhere it grows.\r\n\r\nMEXICAN COTTONWOOD (_Populus mexicana_) extends its range north of the\r\nMexican boundary into southern Arizona and southwestern New Mexico. It\r\nis abundant in Mexico where the largest trees are eighty feet high and\r\nthree or four in diameter. It is smaller near the northern limits of its\r\nrange, and there it hugs the banks of mountain streams. Stockmen use the\r\ntrunks, which are usually small enough to be called poles, to make\r\nfences and sheds.\r\n\r\nNARROWLEAF COTTONWOOD (_Populus angustifolia_)is a mountain species\r\nwhich manages to live in the semi-arid regions from the Rocky Mountains\r\nof Canada to Arizona, but is seldom found below an elevation of 5,000\r\nfeet, and it ranges up to 10,000. Trunks are eighteen inches or less in\r\ndiameter, and fifty or sixty feet high. The seeds are larger than those\r\nof most other cottonwoods. It being a semi-desert species, its wood is\r\nappreciated where it is accessible, and it has local uses only.\r\n\r\nLANCELEAF COTTONWOOD (_Populus acuminata_) is a small tree with limited\r\nrange, growing in the arid region along the eastern base of the Rocky\r\nMountains, southward from the Black Hills. It is found also north of the\r\nCanadian border. It is usually fifteen or eighteen inches in diameter,\r\nand thirty or forty feet high. Trunks seldom go to sawmills, but some\r\nlocal use is made of the wood. Trees are occasionally planted for shade\r\nin towns of western Nebraska and Wyoming.\r\n\r\nFREMONT COTTONWOOD (_Populus fremontii_), called white cottonwood in New\r\nMexico, but elsewhere simply cottonwood, grows from western Texas to\r\nCalifornia, and as far north as Utah and Colorado. It sometimes attains\r\na diameter of five or six feet and a height of 100. The Indians in New\r\nMexico formerly made rude, clumsy ox carts of this wood, without a scrap\r\nof iron or other metal in the vehicles. One of the carts is preserved in\r\nthe National Museum, Washington, D. C. The wood is tough and light, but\r\nit is dull white, with no attractive figure. Even the annual rings are\r\nhardly distinguishable. Logs are occasionally sawed into lumber, and\r\nfarmers in western Texas make wagon beds of it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBALM OF GILEAD\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BALM OF GILEAD]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBALM OF GILEAD\r\n\r\n(_Populus Balsamifera_)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis tree is known in different regions by the following names: Balsam,\r\nbalm of Gilead, cottonwood, poplar, balsam poplar, and tacamahac. The\r\nusual name, balm of Gilead, is applied in recognition of the supposed\r\nhealing virtue of the wax which covers the buds and young leaves. It has\r\nlong been used in medicine, but its exact value is still a matter of\r\ndiscussion. The wild Indians of the North discovered a use for the\r\nbalsam in mending their bark dishes, and plugging knot holes in the\r\nwooden trenchers. The wax is slow to dissolve in water, and it resisted\r\nfor a long time such soups as were known to the redman’s culinary art.\r\nBees know the value of the wax and use it to seal cracks and crevices in\r\ntheir hives and to hold the comb in place. It is popularly believed that\r\nthe economy of the wax on the buds is to keep them from freezing. That\r\nview is erroneous, for it would take more than a coating of wax to keep\r\nthe buds warm with the thermometer from fifty to seventy degrees below\r\nzero, as it is every winter in some parts of this tree’s range.\r\n\r\nBalm of Gilead is a native of the North from the Atlantic to the\r\nPacific, but its finest growth is about the headwaters of the Mackenzie\r\nriver, on Peace and Laird rivers, and the lower valley of the Athabaska.\r\nSixty years ago Sir John Franklin reported that most of the driftwood of\r\nthe Arctic ocean was this species. Since that time the range has been\r\nmore definitely determined, and it is now known that the tree grows so\r\nfar north that it is for some weeks in darkness, and again in summer for\r\nsome weeks in unbroken sunshine. It grows in Alaska nearly 200 miles\r\nnorth of the Arctic circle. Its natural range southward reaches New\r\nEngland, New York, Michigan, Nebraska, Nevada, and Oregon.\r\n\r\nTrees of all sizes abound, from mere shrubs in the outskirts of its\r\nrange to trunks 100 feet high and six feet in diameter in favored\r\nlocalities. In the United States the best timber seldom exceeds thirty\r\ninches in diameter and sixty or seventy feet in height. The bark on\r\nlimbs and young trunks is brownish-gray, frequently so tinged with green\r\nthat it is noticeable at a considerable distance; but usually large\r\ntrees have reddish-gray bark with deep furrows and wide ridges. Year-old\r\ntwigs are clear, shiny reddish-brown; end buds are about an inch long,\r\nthe side buds somewhat shorter.\r\n\r\nThe wood is not distinguishable in appearance from that of the other\r\npoplars or cottonwoods, but it is lighter than most of them, weighing\r\n22.65 pounds per cubic foot, has a breaking strength which places it\r\namong the weakest woods, but in stiffness making a much better showing.\r\nThe pores are small, numerous, and are distributed equally through all\r\nparts of the wood.\r\n\r\nBalm of Gilead bears seeds abundantly and scatters them widely. It must\r\ndo its planting quickly in the short summers of the cold North. It\r\nsticks close to alluvial flats, banks of rivers, borders of lakes and\r\nswamps, and gravelly soils. It grows to a diameter of fifteen inches in\r\nabout forty-five years.\r\n\r\nThough balm of Gilead is not one of the most important timber trees of\r\nthis country, its place is by no means obscure. No separate tally is\r\nkept of it among woods cut for pulp, but it goes with aspen and other\r\nsimilar species as “poplar.” A little better account is kept of the\r\namount passing through wood-using factories. The annual quantity so\r\nreported in Illinois is 2,775,000 feet, and it is made into boxes and\r\ncrates. The lumber is shipped from the North, since it does not grow as\r\nfar south as Illinois. The situation is different in Michigan, for balm\r\nof Gilead grows there. The amount going yearly into factories in that\r\nstate is reported at 4,912,000 feet. It is made into many commodities,\r\nbut boxes and crates take most of it. The wood is reduced to veneer and\r\nconverted into berry buckets, grape baskets, fruit and egg crates, and\r\nother small shipping containers. It is made into excelsior and woodwool\r\nwhich are used as packing material. Druggist’s barrels are manufactured\r\nfrom this wood. These are small, two-piece vessels, bored hollow, with a\r\nclosely fitting lid, and varying in size from a couple of inches high,\r\nto nearly a foot. They contain powders, perfumes, pills, and other\r\ncommodities in small bulk. The wood is worked into pails, tubs, and\r\nkegs. Furniture makers put balm of Gilead to use in several ways. It is\r\ncut thin for shelving; it is made into panels, and is employed as cores\r\nover which to lay veneers of more expensive materials. Woodenware\r\nfactories generally keep it in stock in the northern states.\r\n\r\nThe supply is ample at present to meet all demands. Cutters of pulpwood\r\nprobably take more than sawmills, and are satisfied with smaller timber.\r\nTrees are often planted for ornament, but few if any have yet been\r\npropagated for forestry purposes.\r\n\r\nHAIRY BALM OF GILEAD (_Populus balsamifera candicans_) is not a species\r\nbut a variety, and it is so different from balm of Gilead that it is\r\nentitled to a place of its own. Ordinarily it passes under the common\r\nnames applied to balm of Gilead. It is a cultivated tree in eastern\r\nCanada and northeastern United States, where it has escaped from\r\ncultivation and is running wild. Both Sargent and Sudworth say that\r\nnothing is definitely known of the tree’s native range; while it has\r\nbeen claimed by others that it once grew wild in Michigan but was\r\ndestroyed by lumbermen. Probably most planted balm of Gileads are of\r\nthis variety, as they are very ornamental. It is a large tree with\r\nbranches less upright and crowns more open than in the wild species. The\r\nleaves are wide, heart-shaped, and are usually silvery white beneath\r\nwith minute hairs on the margins, on the veins, and leaf stems. It is\r\nnot improbable that this variety could be more profitably planted for\r\nforestry purposes than the species which grows wild; but there is no\r\npresent indication that foresters favorably consider either of them.\r\n\r\nLARGETOOTH ASPEN (_Populus grandidentata_) is named on account of the\r\nshape of the leaves. It is sometimes called aspen, popple, white poplar,\r\nand large poplar. The wood weighs 28.87 pounds per cubic foot, and is\r\nthe heaviest of the poplar group except Fremont cottonwood of the arid\r\nsouthwestern regions. The wood is white, attractive, but not strong. It\r\nwas formerly manufactured into chip hats and shoe heels in New England,\r\nand is now used for baskets, crates, boxes, buckets, refrigerators,\r\nexcelsior, and pulp. Northern factories usually give it the general name\r\n“poplar,” and for that reason its importance in the lumber trade is\r\nunderestimated. Trees may reach a height of seventy feet with a diameter\r\nof two; but a height of forty or fifty is more usual. The species’ range\r\nextends from Nova Scotia to Minnesota, southward to Delaware and\r\nIllinois, and along the Appalachian mountains to North Carolina and\r\nTennessee.\r\n\r\nGUMBO LIMBO (_Bursera simaruba_) is a south Florida species and is known\r\nalso as West Indian birch. It is in a family by itself with no near\r\nrelative. It is not a birch. The wood is spongy and very light, weighing\r\nless than nineteen pounds per cubic foot. It decays with remarkable\r\nrapidity. Branches thrust in the ground take root and grow. An aromatic\r\nresin, exuding from wounds in the bark, is manufactured into varnish.\r\nThe leaves are substituted for tea, and gout remedies are made from the\r\nresin. Large trees are fifty feet high and two feet or more in diameter.\r\nAnother Florida tree, not in the same family as this, is also called\r\ngumbo limbo (_Simarouba glauca_), paradise tree, and bitter wood.\r\nAilanthus (_Ailanthus glandulosa_) is in the same family as paradise\r\ntree, but is not native in this country, though extensively planted\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nANGELICA TREE (_Aralia spinosa_). This is a small tree, which usually\r\ndevelops little or no heartwood. The springwood, or the inner and porous\r\npart of the ring, is broad and yellow, the summerwood, or exterior part\r\nof the ring, is narrow and dark. The wood’s figure, due to the marked\r\ncontrast between the outer and inner portions of the rings, is strong.\r\nWhen finished it shows a rich yellow, but somewhat lighter than dwarf\r\nsumach which it resembles. It is made into small shop articles, like\r\nbutton boxes, photograph frames, pen racks, stools, and arms for\r\nrocking chairs. Its range extends from Pennsylvania to Texas. It is\r\nsometimes known as Hercules’ club.\r\n\r\n    ASPEN (_Populus tremuloides_) is widely known but not everywhere by\r\n    the same name. It is called quaking asp, mountain asp, aspen leaf,\r\n    white poplar, popple, poplar, and trembling poplar. The peculiarity\r\n    of the tree which is apt to attract attention, and which gives it\r\n    most of the names it carries, is the leaf’s habit of being nearly\r\n    always in motion. The day is remarkably still if aspen foliage is\r\n    not stirring. This is due to the long, flat leaf stem, which is so\r\n    limber that it offers little resistance to air currents. The\r\n    difference in color between the upper and lower sides of the leaves\r\n    affords sufficient contrast to attract notice, and for that reason a\r\n    person will observe the motion of aspen leaves when he might fail to\r\n    see a similar movement among the leaves of other species where the\r\n    contrast of colors is not so marked. Aspen is credited with being\r\n    the most widely distributed tree of North America. It grows from\r\n    Tennessee to the Arctic ocean, from Mexico to northern Alaska, from\r\n    Labrador to Bering strait. It is found at sea level, and at 10,000\r\n    feet elevation among the mountains of California. Its very small\r\n    seeds grow in enormous numbers. Winds carry them miles, and scatter\r\n    them by millions. They spring up quickly when they fall on mineral\r\n    soil. This places it in the class with “fire trees”--those which\r\n    take possession of burned tracts. Paper birch is in this class.\r\n    Aspen has replaced pines over large burned areas of the Rocky\r\n    Mountains. It grows quickly but is weak if it has to contend with\r\n    other trees. If crowded it speedily gives up the fight and dies. The\r\n    wood is not strong, but is useful for several purposes. Next to\r\n    spruce and hemlock, it is the most important pulpwood in this\r\n    country, and it is coming into considerable use as lumber. The\r\n    whiteness of the wood--it looks much like holly--makes it a favorite\r\n    for small boxes and vessels for shipping and containing foods. It is\r\n    made into jelly buckets, lard pails, fish kits, spice kegs, sugar\r\n    buckets and a long line of similar articles. It turns well, and is\r\n    made into wooden dishes. Michigan alone uses two and a half million\r\n    feet of it a year; and it is in demand along the whole northern tier\r\n    of states from Maine to Washington, but because it is not separately\r\n    listed in lumber output, it is difficult to say how much is used.\r\n    Trees are usually small, though trunks three feet in diameter are\r\n    not unknown. It grows rapidly, and may be expected to fill an\r\n    important place in this country’s future timber supply. There will\r\n    be no occasion to plant it by artificial means, for nature will\r\n    attend to the planting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBLACK COTTONWOOD\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BLACK COTTONWOOD]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBLACK COTTONWOOD\r\n\r\n(_Populus Trichocarpa_)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis member of the cottonwood group is a strong tree that holds its\r\nground in various latitudes and at many elevations, ranging from sea\r\nlevel up to eight or nine thousand feet, and in latitude from Alaska to\r\nsouthern California, a distance of nearly three thousand miles. Its east\r\nand west extension is more restricted and seldom exceeds four hundred\r\nmiles. Its habitat covers an area of half a million square miles, and in\r\nthat space it finds conditions which vary so greatly that the tree which\r\ncan meet them must possess remarkable powers of adaptation.\r\n\r\nBeginning in Alaska and the interior of Yukon territory, it has an\r\narctic climate. It there not only grows on the coast, but it strikes the\r\ninterior. It appears on the headwaters of several streams which flow\r\ninto the Mackenzie or Hudson bay. It passes south through British\r\nColumbia and enters the United States west of the Rocky Mountains. It\r\nhas been reported as far east as Idaho and Montana, but further\r\ninformation is needed before its limits in that direction can be\r\ndefinitely fixed.\r\n\r\nWhen it enters California it prefers the elevated valleys and canyons of\r\nthe Sierra Nevadas, though it occurs sparingly among the coast ranges.\r\nIt is generally found in the Sierras at elevations of from 3,000 to\r\n6,000 feet, though it occurs between 8,000 and 9,000. Among the San\r\nJacinto mountains of southern California it grows at an altitude of\r\n6,000 feet.\r\n\r\nWhen it occurs at low levels it is usually found on river bottoms and\r\nsand bars, in sandy and humous soils, and there the largest trees are\r\nfound. At higher elevations it is more apt to occur in canyon bottoms\r\nand gulches, in moist, sandy or gravelly soil, and in such situations\r\nthe black cottonwood is smaller. The best growth occurs where the\r\nclimate is humid and the precipitation is great. Beyond the reach of sea\r\nfogs, where the tree depends on soil moisture chiefly, it is smaller.\r\n\r\nIt is an intolerant tree. It must have light. When it is crowded a tall,\r\nslender trunk is developed and the small crown is lifted clear above its\r\ncompetitors into the full light. If it cannot succeed in gaining that\r\nposition its growth is stunted or the tree meets an early death.\r\n\r\nThe black cottonwood is the greatest of the cottonwoods. This country\r\nproduces no other to match it, and, as far as known, the whole world has\r\nnone. The Pacific coast is remarkable for the giant trees it produces,\r\nbut most of them are softwoods--the redwoods, the bigtree, the sugar\r\npine, Douglas fir, western larch, noble fir, Sitka spruce and western\r\nred cedar. This cottonwood is the largest of the Pacific coast\r\nhardwoods. In trunk diameter it is excelled by the weeping oak in the\r\ninterior valleys of California, but when both height and diameter are\r\nconsidered, the black cottonwood is in the West what yellow poplar is in\r\nthe East, the largest of the hardwoods.\r\n\r\nSargent says this tree reaches a height of two hundred feet and a\r\ndiameter of eight, but Sudworth is more conservative and places the\r\ntrunk limit at six feet. The average size is much below the figures\r\ngiven, but abundance of logs exceeding three feet in diameter reach the\r\nsawmills of Washington and Oregon.\r\n\r\nOld trees range from 150 to 200 years in age, but trees under 100 years\r\nold are large enough for saw timber. Records of the ages of the largest\r\ntrunks have not been reported.\r\n\r\nBlack cottonwood is a prolific seeder, but the seeds do not long retain\r\ntheir vitality. If they find lodgment in damp situations, where other\r\nconditions are favorable, the rate of germination is high. Seedlings are\r\noften very numerous on wet bars.\r\n\r\nThe excellent quality of the wood and its suitability for many purposes\r\nbring it much demand on the Pacific coast. In the state of Washington\r\nmore than 30,000,000 feet were used by wood-using industries in 1910.\r\nSmaller quantities were reported in Oregon and California.\r\n\r\nIn strength the wood is approximately the same as common cottonwood, but\r\nin stiffness it much exceeds the eastern species. Its elasticity rates\r\nhigh, and compares favorably with some of the valuable eastern\r\nhardwoods. In weight it is slightly under common cottonwood. Trees are\r\nof fine form, nearly always straight, and are generally free from limbs\r\nto a considerable height.\r\n\r\nThe wood is grayish-white, soft, tough, odorless, tasteless,\r\nlong-fibered, nails well, is easily glued, and cuts into excellent\r\nrotary veneer with comparatively small expenditure of power. It does not\r\nsplit easily after it has undergone seasoning, and this property\r\ncommends it to box makers. It is little disposed to shrink and swell in\r\natmospheric changes. The absence of odor and taste gives it much of its\r\nvalue for box making, because foods are not contaminated by contact with\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIt is manufactured into veneer berry baskets and is one of the most\r\nsuitable woods on the Pacific coast for that purpose. Candy barrel\r\nmakers use it in preference to most others, and a long line of\r\nwoodenware articles draw much of their material from this source. Many\r\nthousands of cords are cut yearly for the pulp mills, where material for\r\npaper is produced. Black cottonwood and white fir are the principal\r\nwoods used for pulp on the Pacific coast.\r\n\r\nNot only is it used for rotary-cut veneer, but it is made into cores or\r\nbacking on which veneers of costly woods are glued in the manufacture of\r\nfurniture, interior finish and fixtures for banks, stores and offices.\r\nIt serves in the same way in casket making, and is demanded in millions\r\nof feet.\r\n\r\nIt is employed in amounts larger than any other wood by excelsior mills\r\nin the northern Pacific coast region. It is the only wood demanded by\r\nthat industry in Washington and 6,400,000 feet were cut into that\r\nproduct in 1910.\r\n\r\nSlack coopers find it as valuable in their business in the far West as\r\nthe common cottonwood is in the East, and hundreds of thousands of\r\nstaves are made yearly. It is in demand for the manufacture of flour\r\nbarrels and those intended for other food products.\r\n\r\nTrunk makers use it in three-ply veneers for the bodies, trays, boxes\r\nand compartments of trunks and for suit cases. Though soft and light, it\r\nis very tough, and sheets of veneer with the grains placed transversely\r\nresist strains much better than solid wood of the same thickness.\r\n\r\nVehicle makers employ black cottonwood for the tops and shelves of\r\nbusiness wagons. Another of its uses is as bottoms of drawers for\r\nbureaus, wardrobes, and chiffoniers, and as partitions in desk\r\ncompartments. A full line of kitchen and pantry furniture is made wholly\r\nor in part of this wood in the regions where it is cheap and abundant.\r\n\r\nThe cottonwoods belong to a very ancient race of broadleaf trees, and\r\nlike several others, they seem to have had their origin, or at least a\r\nvery early home, in the far North, where intense cold now excludes\r\nalmost every form of vegetable growth except the lowest orders. The\r\nCretaceous age saw cottonwoods growing in Greenland. The cotton which\r\nthen, as now, carried the seeds and planted them fell on more hospitable\r\nshores then than can now be found in the far frozen North. The genus was\r\nnot confined to the arctic and subarctic regions, however, for there\r\nwere cottonwoods at that time, or later, in more southern latitudes.\r\nThere were many species in the central portion of this country, and also\r\nin Europe, long before the ice age destroyed all the forests north of\r\nthe Ohio and the Missouri rivers. Some of the old species long ago\r\nceased to exist, but others appear to have come down to the present time\r\nwithout great change.\r\n\r\nThe cottonwood shows wonderful vitality, which is doubtless a survival\r\nof the characteristic which enabled it to come down from former geologic\r\nepochs to the present time. A damaged and mutilated tree will recover. A\r\nbroken limb, thrust in the ground, will grow.\r\n\r\n    BLACK POPLAR (_Populus nigra_) is quite distinct from black\r\n    cottonwood, though both belong to the same family. The latter is a\r\n    Pacific coast species, while the former belongs in Europe, although\r\n    it may have been introduced into that country from Persia or some\r\n    other eastern region. It is common in the United States, on account\r\n    of having escaped from cultivation. The best known variety of this\r\n    tree is the Lombardy poplar (_Populus nigra italica_). It is easily\r\n    recognized by the characteristic attitude of the branches which grow\r\n    upward close against the trunk. The crowns of the trees are very\r\n    long and slender, sometimes not ten feet across though fifty feet\r\n    high. Their slimness gives the trees the appearance of being much\r\n    taller than they really are. They were formerly popular for planting\r\n    along lanes and in door yards. Their slender and pointed spires cut\r\n    the horizon with a peculiar effect. Planting is less common now than\r\n    formerly, because people have come to know the trees better. They\r\n    are probably the most limby of all the members of the cottonwood\r\n    group. The long trunks are masses of knots when the limbs have been\r\n    trimmed away, and any desire to make lumber of the trees is apt to\r\n    be discouraged, though not infrequently logs go to local sawmills,\r\n    and farmers haul the boards home to put them to some use about the\r\n    place. In Michigan and Ohio, box makers use the lumber for the\r\n    rougher and cheaper articles which they turn out.\r\n\r\n    The most discouraging thing about Lombardy poplar is the tendency of\r\n    the trees to send up sprouts. The living trees do it, and the stumps\r\n    are worse. The sprouts are not confined to the ground immediately\r\n    round the base of the tree, but spring up many feet or many yards\r\n    distant, until they produce a veritable jungle. Years are often\r\n    required to complete their extermination by grubbing and cutting.\r\n\r\n    WHITE POPLAR (_Populus alba_) is a European species but has become\r\n    naturalized in the United States. It is widely planted as a shade\r\n    tree, and has escaped from cultivation. It may be known by the white\r\n    undersides of its small leaves, and by its yellowish-green bark\r\n    which remains smooth, except on large trunks. It is not yet\r\n    important as a source of lumber, but the vigor of its growth\r\n    indicates that it may sometime become so. The wood is soft, white,\r\n    and light. Some persons consider the tree objectionable as an\r\n    ornament because of its habit of sending up sprouts from the roots,\r\n    and because its woolly leaves collect dust and smoke until they are\r\n    almost black by the end of summer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMANGROVE\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MANGROVE]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMANGROVE\r\n\r\n(_Rhizophora Mangle_)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mangrove family is large and widely scattered, but only one member\r\nhas gained a foothold in the United States, and it occupies only limited\r\nareas in south Florida, at the delta of the Mississippi, and on the\r\ncoast of Texas. The family’s fifteen genera are confined to the tropics,\r\nwith a little overlapping on the temperate zones. The botanical name\r\n_Rhizophora_ refers to the tree’s peculiar roots, and _mangle_ is the\r\nSpanish for mangrove. This is one of the few trees in this country which\r\nare known by a single name. It is always called mangrove, and attains\r\nits best development in Florida.\r\n\r\nThe leaves hang two years, are from three to five inches long and one or\r\ntwo wide. Flowers are not showy, but they are nearly always present,\r\nblooming the year round, the yellow blossom about an inch in diameter.\r\nThe fruit proper is about an inch long, but its habit of sprouting while\r\nstill on the tree and sending down a long stem-like root, gives the\r\nimpression that the fruit is several inches long, sometimes a foot.\r\n\r\nIt is not an easy matter to state the average size of mangrove trees.\r\nPeculiar habits of growth make measurements difficult. Neither is it\r\neasy to tell where a tree begins and where it ends. Mangrove thickets\r\nalong some of the rivers of south Florida, within the influence of tide\r\nwater, are strange forms of vegetation. If the foliage alone is\r\nconsidered from a little distance, it reminds one of a row of fig trees\r\nin Louisiana or California. The color and general appearance suggests\r\nfig trees. A nearer approach reveals beneath the crowns a mass of roots,\r\nstems, and limbs, joined with the ground beneath and the crowns above.\r\nIn addition to these, there are many others that dangle from above, like\r\nrope ends, some nearly touching the ground, others several feet above.\r\nThese are roots or limbs, by whichever name one cares to call them. They\r\ngrow from overhead branches, and strike for the ground. When they touch\r\nthe soil, they quickly anchor themselves, and become stems. They then\r\nlook like slender poles set as props under the branches of an overladen\r\nfruit tree.\r\n\r\nThis strange habit of growth gives the tree its character. Most\r\nmangroves stand in water. They fringe the banks of rivers and bayous,\r\nextending the fringe as far as the water is shallow. Growth of that kind\r\nis generally from ten to twenty feet high, and the largest stems from an\r\ninch in diameter up to three or four; but these dimensions cannot be\r\ntaken as limits to size. Sometimes the trees are sixty or seventy feet\r\nhigh, but those which stand in water seldom reach that size. Trees\r\nwhich have their beginning in the water sometimes end their days high\r\nand dry on the land.\r\n\r\nThe mangrove is a land builder. The sycamore and willow are land\r\nbuilders on a small scale, along northern water-courses, but mangrove\r\nexcels them a hundred or a thousand fold where it grows on the low\r\nshores of Florida. The seed is prepared for land-building work before it\r\ndrops from the tree. It sprouts a long, peculiar root--it looks like a\r\nvery slender, big-ended cucumber--the large, heavy end down. This\r\nattains a length of several inches or a foot. When it drops from the\r\nbranch, the end sticks in the mud and takes root, grows, and produces a\r\ntree. But generally it falls in water, and not on a mud bank. In that\r\ncase it floats away, the heavy end down, the light end barely appearing\r\non the surface. Winds and currents drive it about until the lower tip\r\nfinally touches bottom in some shallow place. There it takes root, and\r\nunless circumstances are extremely adverse, it holds fast, finally\r\nbecomes a tree, sends branches down from above to take root at the\r\nbottom of the water, and a clump is produced. The tangled mass of stems\r\nand roots catches driftwood and mud, resulting finally in a little\r\nisland, and later the island is joined to the mainland. Thus the land is\r\nbuilt. Many large flats in Florida owe their origin to this tree. When\r\nland is permanently above water, the mangrove loses, to some extent, its\r\nability to send roots down from the limbs. Nature seldom does something\r\nfor nothing, and since the mangrove’s aerial roots no longer serve a\r\nuseful purpose in nature’s economy, they are dispensed with. Trunks then\r\nreach much larger size, and become timber instead of thickets. The\r\naccompanying picture shows a mangrove that no longer stands in water,\r\nand its habit of growth is changing.\r\n\r\nThickets of mangrove are useful, not only in building new land, but in\r\nprotecting that already built. Frequently the force of waves is broken,\r\nwhich otherwise would destroy low shores. Tremendous seas, in time of\r\nstorms, will roll over thickets of mangrove without uprooting them or\r\nbreaking the stems. Again nature’s fine engineering is apparent. When\r\nmen build lighthouses which must endure the shocks of waves, they have\r\nlearned to construct them of open beams and lattice work. The wave\r\npasses through without delivering the full impact of the blow to the\r\nstructure. No solid masonry will stand what a comparatively light open\r\nframe will endure without injury, because it allows the waves to pass\r\non. A large wave may strike with a force of 6,000 pounds to the square\r\nfoot. The mangrove thickets are like the open-framed lighthouse--they\r\nlet the waves pass through and spend their force gradually beyond, but\r\nthey hold the shore against washing.\r\n\r\nAdmirable and wonderful as is nature’s provision for protecting the\r\nland by a fringe of lattice work of branches and stems, the marvelous\r\nefficiency of the provision has been greatly increased in another way.\r\nSuppose, for illustration, that cottonwood instead of mangrove formed\r\nthe protective thickets along stormy shores. The first hour of heavy\r\nseas would reduce the trees to fragments. The weak, brittle trunks and\r\nlimbs would quickly break to pieces. But mangrove passes through storm\r\nafter storm unharmed. It is scarcely believable that accident accounts\r\nfor the fact that the best wood for the place is in the place; but it is\r\nprobable, rather, that ages of development and natural selection gave to\r\nmangrove the qualities which make possible the accomplishment of its\r\nwork. It is one of the strongest, and as far as available data may be\r\ndepended upon, it is absolutely the most elastic wood in the United\r\nStates. Shellbark hickory is rated high in both strength and elasticity;\r\nbut mangrove rates higher. Sargent gives hickory’s measure of elasticity\r\nat 1,925,000 pounds per square inch; but mangrove’s is 2,333,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nIt is thus fitted in the highest manner to perform the work needed. It\r\nplants itself in the right place; develops stems which will endure most\r\nand suffer least; possesses enormous strength for resisting force, yet\r\nis so extremely elastic that the force of waves is exhausted upon the\r\ntrunks and branches without flattening them upon the ground or crushing\r\nthem. Few things of the vegetable world show more perfect adaptation to\r\nenvironment. The wood’s very heaviness seems to add one more quality\r\nfitting it for its place. When a trunk falls in the water, it does not\r\nfloat away as most trees would, but sinks like iron, lies on the bottom,\r\nhelps to hold the forming island or bar in place, and in its death as in\r\nits life it is a land-builder. Its efficiency in that particular is\r\nincreased by the fact that it is little affected by marine borers which,\r\nin the warm, brackish waters, usually destroy wood in a short time.\r\n\r\nMangrove is not important commercially, though it is used for a number\r\nof purposes. The wood weighs 72.4 pounds per cubic foot, takes good\r\npolish, though it is inclined to check in drying; it contains many small\r\npores; medullary rays numerous and thin; color reddish-brown streaked\r\nwith lighter brown. The principal use of the bark is for tanning and the\r\ntrunks for piles. It is well fitted for fence posts, but not many have\r\nbeen used in the region where it grows. It rates high as fuel, but its\r\ngreat weight increases transportation charges if the haul is long.\r\n\r\nTanbark peelers in Florida have cut much of the large mangrove forest.\r\nThey took the bark, and abandoned the trunks. There is no likelihood\r\nthat the species will be exterminated. Much of the growth is practically\r\ninaccessible, and the trunks are too small to tempt bark peelers, and\r\ncordwood cutters find plenty of material more convenient.\r\n\r\n    OTHER SPECIES.--Two other trees of this country are called mangrove\r\n    though they are not even in the same family. One is the black\r\n    mangrove (_Avicennia nitida_), called also blackwood and black tree.\r\n    It is a Florida species of the family Verbenaceæ, and has some of\r\n    the mangrove’s habits. It takes root and grows on muddy shores and\r\n    is a land builder. The largest trees are sixty or seventy feet high\r\n    and two in diameter, but are usually less than thirty feet high. The\r\n    bark is used in tanning, and no use for the wood is reported, except\r\n    for fuel. White mangrove (_Laguncularia racemosa_), known also as\r\n    white buttonwood, is a Florida species. It attains a height of\r\n    thirty or forty feet and a diameter of a foot or more. It reaches\r\n    its largest size on the shores of Shark river, Florida. The wood is\r\n    dark yellow-brown, and the bark is rich in tannin, and the tree may\r\n    become valuable as a source of tanbark.\r\n\r\n    Near akin to white mangrove is Florida buttonwood (_Conocarpus\r\n    erecta_) which is highly esteemed as fuel. It burns slowly like\r\n    charcoal. Trees are from twenty to fifty feet high. Its range lies\r\n    in southern Florida. Black olive tree (_Terminalia buceras_) belongs\r\n    in the south Florida group, and the wood is exceedingly hard and\r\n    heavy. The trunk is often two or three feet in diameter, but lies on\r\n    the ground like a log, with upright stems growing from it. Tanners\r\n    make use of the bark.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCABBAGE PALMETTO\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CABBAGE PALMETTO]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PALMS\r\n\r\n\r\nLumbermen in this country could get along very well without the palms,\r\nas they are little used for ordinary lumber. Their wood does not grow in\r\nconcentric rings, like that of the ordinary tree. The stems are usually\r\nsingle, cylindrical, and unbranched. The fruit is berry-like, and is\r\nusually one seeded, though sometimes there are two or three. When a seed\r\nsprouts, it puts out at first a single leaf, like a grain of corn. About\r\n130 genera of palms are recognized in the world, most of them in the\r\ntropics, but several in the United States are of tree size. Botanists\r\ndivide the palms of the United States into two groups, the palm family\r\nand the lily family. The yuccas belong in the lily family. In the very\r\nbrief treatment that can be given the subject here, it is not necessary\r\nto recognize strict family divisions.\r\n\r\nCABBAGE PALMETTO (_Sabal palmetto_) grows in the coast region from North\r\nCarolina to southern Florida, and west to the Apalachicola river. It is\r\nsometimes called Bank’s palmetto, cabbage tree, and tree palmetto. The\r\nname cabbage is due to the large leaf-bud in the top of the stem which\r\nis cooked as a substitute for cabbage. A sharp hatchet and some\r\nexperience are necessary to a successful operation in extracting the bud\r\nfrom the tough fibers which surround it.\r\n\r\nThis palm is a familiar sight in the coast region within its range. The\r\ntall trunks, with tufts of leaves at the tops, suggest the supposed\r\nscenery of the Carboniferous age. Usually the trunks, in thick stands,\r\nrise straight like columns from twenty to forty feet high, but\r\noccasionally they bend in long, graceful curves, as if the weight of the\r\ntops caused them to careen, which is probably what does happen. They\r\nvary in diameter from eight inches to two feet.\r\n\r\nThe leaves are five or six feet long, and seven or eight wide, with\r\nstems six or seven feet long. Flowers occur in racemes two feet or more\r\nin length. The fruit is spherical and about a third of an inch in\r\ndiameter. The roots are an important part of this palm, and are adapted\r\nto their environment, forming a rounded mass four or five feet in\r\ndiameter, while small rope-like roots, half an inch in diameter,\r\npenetrate the wet marshy soil fifteen or twenty feet. The large,\r\nglobe-like mass gives support in the soft soil, and the stringy roots\r\nsupply water and mineral substances essential to growth. The wood is\r\nlight, soft, pale-brown, with numerous hard, fibro-vascular bundles, the\r\nouter rim about two inches thick and much lighter and softer than the\r\ninterior. The most important use for the wood at present is as wharf\r\npiles. It lasts well and is ideal in form. It is of historical interest\r\nthat Fort Moultrie which defended Charleston, South Carolina, in the\r\nRevolutionary war, was built of palmetto logs. When the British made\r\ntheir memorable attack in 1776, their cannon balls buried in the spongy\r\nlogs without dislodging them, and the fort successfully withstood the\r\nbombardment of ten hours, and disabled nine of the ten British ships\r\ntaking part in the assault.\r\n\r\nThe wood is employed to a small extent in furniture making, and the bark\r\nfor scrubbing brushes. Some of the finest forests of palmetto in Florida\r\nare much injured by fire that runs up the trunks to feed on stubs of\r\nleaves.\r\n\r\nSILKTOP PALMETTO (_Thrinax parviflora_) and silvertop palmetto (_Thrinax\r\nmicrocarpa_) are species met with on some of the islands off the coast\r\nof southern Florida.\r\n\r\nMEXICAN PALMETTO (_Sabal mexicana_) is much like cabbage palmetto in\r\nsize and general appearance, and is put to similar uses, except that the\r\nleaf-bud does not appear to be used as food. The tree occurs in Texas\r\nalong the lower Rio Grande, and southward into Mexico where the leaves\r\nare employed as house thatch by improvident Mexicans and Indians who do\r\nnot care to exert themselves to procure better roofing material. In the\r\nvicinity of Brownsville, Texas, trunks of this palm are employed as\r\nporch posts and present a rustic appearance. They are said to last many\r\nyears. The average size of trunks in Texas is fifteen or twenty feet\r\nhigh and a foot or less in diameter, but some much larger are found in\r\nMexico. Some of the wharfs along the Texas coast are built on palmetto\r\npiles. It is said the trunks are not as strong as those of the cabbage\r\npalmetto in Florida.\r\n\r\nSARGENT PALM (_Pseudophœnix sargentii_) is interesting but not\r\ncommercially important, but may become so as an ornamental plant. It is\r\noccasionally planted on lawns in south Florida. Leaves are five or six\r\nfeet long with stems still longer. The clusters of flowers are sometimes\r\nthree feet in length. A single species is known, occurring on certain\r\nkeys in southern Florida, and is so limited in its range that it would\r\nbe possible to count every tree in existence. A grove of 200 or 300\r\ntrees occurs on Key Largo.\r\n\r\nROYAL PALM (_Oreodoxa regia_) is one of the largest palms of this\r\ncountry. It is said to reach a height of eighty feet, but such sizes are\r\nrare. The trunk rises from an enlarged base, and may be two feet in\r\ndiameter. Bark is light gray in color, and its appearance suggests a\r\ncolumn of cement. Leaves are ten or twelve feet long, and the stems\r\nincrease the total length to twenty feet or more. Flowers are two feet\r\nin length, and in Florida open in January and February. The fruit is\r\nsmaller than would be expected of a tree so large. It is a drupe about\r\nthe size of a half-grown grape. The wood is spongy, but the outer\r\nportion of the stem is strong and is made into canes and other small\r\narticles. Trunks are sometimes used as wharf piles. This palm’s range is\r\nconfined to south Florida in this country, but it is common in the West\r\nIndies. In Miami and other towns of southern Florida it is much planted\r\nfor ornament.\r\n\r\nFANLEAF PALM (_Neowashingtonia filamentosa_) also called Washington\r\npalm, California fan palm, Arizona palm, and wild date, ranges through\r\nsouthern California, and occupies depressions in the desert west of the\r\nColorado river. There are said to be several forms and varieties. It\r\nranges in height from thirty-five to seventy feet and in diameter from\r\ntwenty to thirty inches. Trunks are of nearly the same diameter from\r\nbottom to top, or taper very gradually. They usually lean a little. Dead\r\nleaves hang about the trunks and blaze quickly when fire touches them,\r\nbut the palm is seldom killed by fire. The small black fruit is about a\r\nthird of an inch in diameter, and of no commercial importance; wood is\r\nlittle used; and the tree is chiefly ornamental, and has been much\r\nplanted in California.\r\n\r\nMOHAVE YUCCA (_Yucca mohavensis_) is one of a half dozen or more palms\r\nof the yucca genus and the lily family. Trees of this group are\r\ncharacterized by their stiff, sharp-pointed leaves, some of which are\r\ncalled daggers and others bayonets. Both names are appropriate. The\r\nMohave yucca takes its name from the Mohave desert in California, where\r\nit is occasionally an important feature of the doleful landscape. The\r\nragged, leather-like leaves, forming the tops of the short, weird trees,\r\nrattle in the wind, or resound with the patter of pebbles when\r\nsandstorms sweep across the dry wastes. It is believed to be one of the\r\nmost slowly-growing trees of this country. Trunks are seldom more than\r\nfifteen feet high and eight or ten inches in diameter. The wood is\r\nspongy and interlaced with tough, stringy fibers. Stockmen whose ranges\r\ninclude this tree, make corrals of the stems by setting them in the\r\nground as palisades. When weathered by wind and made bone dry by the\r\nsun’s fierce heat, the trunks are reduced to almost cork-lightness.\r\nOther yuccas are the Spanish bayonet (_Yucca treculeana_) of Texas;\r\nJoshua-tree (_Yucca arborescens_), which ranges from Utah to California\r\nand is known as tree yucca, yucca cactus, and the Joshua; Schott yucca\r\n(_Yucca brevifolia_) of southern Arizona; broadfruit yucca (_Yucca\r\nmacrocarpa_) of southwestern Texas; aloe-leaf yucca (_Yucca aloifolia_)\r\nwith a range from North Carolina near the coast to Louisiana; and\r\nSpanish dagger (_Yucca gloriosa_), on the coast and islands of South\r\nCarolina.\r\n\r\n    GIANT CACTUS (_Cereus giganteus_) is a leafless tree of Arizona and\r\n    attains a height of forty or sixty feet, diameter of one or two.\r\n    About twenty genera of cactus are known in the world and a large\r\n    number of species. Two genera, the cereuses and opuntias, have\r\n    representatives of tree size in this country. The two genera differ\r\n    in form. Cereus in the Latin language means a candle, and the\r\n    cactuses of that genus stand up in straight stems like candles, or\r\n    have branches like old-fashioned candlesticks. The opuntias have\r\n    flat, jointed stems, like thick leaves. Giant cactus bears flowers\r\n    four inches long and two wide; fruit two inches long and one wide,\r\n    and edible. Indians derive a considerable part of their food from\r\n    this cactus. They use the wood for rafters, fences, fuel, lances,\r\n    and bows. The trunks consist of bundles of fiber, very hard and\r\n    strong. In the dry region where this cactus grows, the woody parts\r\n    of fallen stems last long periods, some say for centuries, but there\r\n    are no records. Schott cactus (_Cereus schottii_) and Thurber cactus\r\n    (_Cereus thurberi_) are found in southern Arizona and southward in\r\n    Mexico.\r\n\r\n    CHOLLA (_Opuntia fulgida_) ranges from Nevada southward into Mexico.\r\n    It is popularly called “divil’s tongue cactus,” but there are other\r\n    species with the same name. Trunks are occasionally ten or twelve\r\n    feet high, and the wood is made into canes and small articles of\r\n    furniture, but as lumber it is not important. The fruit is not\r\n    eaten. A closely-related species is known as tassajo (_Opuntia\r\n    sponsior_). It is found on the dry mesas of southern Arizona where\r\n    trunks may be ten feet high and a few inches in diameter. It has the\r\n    same uses as cholla. A third species is _Opuntia versicolor_ of\r\n    southern Arizona. It is similar to the other opuntias. Attempts have\r\n    been made to grow spineless varieties of this group of cactuses. It\r\n    is believed that cattle, sheep, and goats would thrive on the pulpy\r\n    growth, if the thorns could be gotten rid of. The semi-desert\r\n    regions of the Southwest produce enormous quantities of cactus of\r\n    many kinds, and if those worthless species could be made way with\r\n    and thornless varieties substituted, it is probable that much land\r\n    now worthless would become valuable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: YELLOW CEDAR]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMINOR SPECIES\r\n\r\n\r\nA considerable number of trees grow in this country which, taken singly,\r\nare of small importance, but in the aggregate they fill a place which\r\nwould be difficult to fill without them. Most of them are local, and are\r\nseldom heard of outside of the regions where they grow. Some are small,\r\nand for that reason are not demanded by the ordinary user of lumber; but\r\nsmall size is not necessarily a bar to the use of a wood. Many places\r\nmay be filled by pieces too small for the sawmill. Sometimes a\r\ndiminutive trunk contains material of extraordinary hardness, or it may\r\nbe polished to a rare smoothness, or the colors may be exquisite.\r\nNumerous commodities can be successfully manufactured from blocks or\r\nbillets which are only a few inches in diameter and a foot or two in\r\nlength. This is particularly true of some of the rare hardwoods of\r\nFlorida and southern Texas where tropical species have extended their\r\nranges northward over the borders of the United States. Some of the\r\nsmall trees in that group are known by name in only the immediate\r\nlocality where they grow, and their qualities are scarcely appreciated\r\neven there. In some instances railroad ties are hewed from wood which is\r\nfit for the finest furniture.\r\n\r\nIt is no uncommon thing for Mexicans along the Rio Grande to warm their\r\nhuts and cook their meals with fuel chopped from trunks of Texas ebony,\r\nalgarita, cat’s claw, bluewood, huisache, retama, and junco. Those who\r\nhave traveled among the Indian rancherias of New Mexico and Utah have\r\ngrown familiar with the peculiar odor filling the air in the vicinity of\r\ncamp fires. It is the smoke of the rare junipers which the Indians burn\r\nfor fuel; and yet it is wood of such soft tones and exquisite blending\r\nof colors that the shades of a Persian rug suffer by comparison. Among\r\nthe ten thousand islands which fringe the coasts of south Florida, and\r\nalso among the hummocks of the mainland, are rare trees whose wood is\r\nunsurpassed in hardness, fineness of texture, and beauty. These are not\r\nbeing used at all, or only as fuel to feed some fisherman’s or camper’s\r\nfire, or to make a smoke to drive away mosquitoes. The time will come\r\nwhen small and scarce woods will be sought, if they are valuable for any\r\nspecial purpose. In preceding pages of this book many minor species have\r\nbeen listed and briefly described in connection with those more\r\nimportant, and with which they are closely related. There are more than\r\na hundred others which were necessarily omitted from former pages. A few\r\nof these deserve at least a brief mention, and are listed in the\r\nfollowing paragraphs.\r\n\r\nKŒBERLINIA (_Kœberlinia spinosa_) is commonly considered a curiosity; a\r\ntree without a relative in the world, and without leaves, flowers, or\r\nfruit. The popular notion is wrong, of course, for no tree is without\r\nrelatives, and none without leaves, flowers, and fruit, or something\r\nthat takes their place. The flowers, leaves, and fruit of this tree are\r\nsmall and escape notice of the casual observer, but they exist. Its\r\nnearest relative in this country is the paradise tree of Florida and the\r\nailanthus introduced from China. It has a small, thorny, crooked trunk;\r\nthe wood is dark, turning nearly black with exposure; it is rich with\r\noil; and it is very hard. The species grows in certain places along the\r\nRio Grande. The wood is made into canes, rulers, knife handles, turned\r\narticles, and a little furniture of the smaller kinds. The trunks are\r\ntoo small for ordinary sizes of lumber.\r\n\r\nGUM ELASTIC (_Bumelia lanuginosa_) ranges from Georgia to Texas, and in\r\nFlorida is called black haw. Children in Texas mix its berries with\r\nchewing gum, to increase the quantity, and the name which they apply to\r\nit is “gum stretch it.” An exuded resin is also used for chewing gum.\r\nTrees are sometimes sixty feet high and two in diameter, and a\r\nconsiderable number of logs go to hardwood mills, where they lose their\r\nname, and possibly appear as ash lumber, or occasionally as maple. The\r\nwood is white, tinged with yellow, and is manufactured into agricultural\r\nimplements. A scarce and smaller species, known as buckthorn bumelia and\r\nironwood (_Bumelia lycioides_) covers nearly the same range. From a tree\r\nof the same family in southern Asia the gutta percha of commerce is\r\nobtained. Other woods of the same family in this country are mastic\r\n(_Sideroxylon mastichodendron_) of south Florida, a tree sometimes sixty\r\nfeet high and three feet in diameter, useful for boat building;\r\nsatinleaf (_Chrysophyllum monopyrenum_), also of Florida, a tree\r\ntwenty-five feet high and one in diameter, the wood very heavy, hard,\r\nand strong; tough bumelia (_Bumelia tenax_), ranging from South Carolina\r\nto Florida, a tree twenty feet high and six inches in diameter, called\r\nblack haw in some parts of its range; saffron plum or ant’s wood\r\n(_Bumelia angustifolia_), growing in Florida and Texas, the trunk twenty\r\nfeet high and six inches in diameter; wood orange colored, and the fruit\r\nsweet; bustic (_Dipholis salicifolia_), in south Florida, a tree forty\r\nfeet high and eighteen inches in diameter, with wood exceedingly hard,\r\nstrong, and heavy, and dark brown or red in color; wild sapodilla or\r\ndilly (_Mimusops sieberi_), a tree of south Florida with rich, very dark\r\nbrown wood, height of tree twenty feet, diameter one foot.\r\n\r\nDWARF SUMACH (_Rhus copallina_) is known by many names. It is\r\ndistinguished from staghorn sumach by its smooth branches, those of\r\nstaghorn being hairy. Sumach’s chief importance is due to its value as\r\ntanning material. Leaves and small branches are used. The family has\r\nsome well-known members in other parts of the world, among them the\r\nmangoes. The name dwarf sumach is not well selected, for the species is\r\nnearly as large as any other sumach. Trees are sometimes thirty feet\r\nhigh and ten inches in diameter. The tree’s range extends from New\r\nEngland to Florida and Texas. It reaches its largest size west of the\r\nMississippi river. In the East and North it is usually a shrub. Trees of\r\nlargest size are not believed to exceed fifty years in age. The wood is\r\nrichly striped with yellow and black. Balls turned of it, seven inches\r\nin diameter, are used for newel-post ornaments, and smaller balls are\r\nmade for use in darning stockings. Cups are turned on the lathe, and the\r\nbright stripes in the wood give the wares a striking appearance. It was\r\nformerly much employed for spiles in tapping maple trees for sugar\r\nmaking. Staghorn sumach (_Rhus hirta_) is of a different species but of\r\nthe same genus. Its range extends from New Brunswick nearly to the\r\nMississippi river. Its name refers to the down on the young branches\r\nresembling the velvet on the horns of a deer at certain seasons. The\r\ntree is known as Virginia sumach and hairy sumach. Its compound leaves\r\nare sometimes two feet long--two or three times the size of dwarf\r\nsumach’s. Trunks have been reported forty feet high and more than a foot\r\nthrough. The uses of this wood are the same as of dwarf sumach,\r\nincluding tanning. It is more abundant east than west of the\r\nAlleghanies. Poisonwood (_Rhus metopium_) belongs to the same family. It\r\nis known in Florida as doctor gum, hog plum, coral sumach, bumwood, and\r\nmountain manchineel. The juice is exceedingly poisonous, and gum\r\nproduced by wounding the bark is reported to have medicinal value. Trees\r\nare sometimes forty feet high and two feet in diameter. The American\r\nsmoke tree (_Cotinus cotinoides_) is another member of the sumach\r\nfamily. It is found in the southern states from eastern Tennessee to\r\nTexas. It is nowhere common, and its only reported use is as fence\r\nposts. Trees may be a foot in diameter and thirty feet high. The wood is\r\na bright clear orange color, and a yellow dye has been manufactured from\r\nit. Poison sumach (_Rhus vernix_) is not the same as poisonwood, though\r\nsometimes the two are confounded. It is usually a shrub, and rarely\r\ntwenty feet high. It is overloaded with names, as might be expected of a\r\nplant considered as dangerous as this. Among its names are poison elder,\r\npoison dogwood, swamp sumach, poison oak, poisonwood, poisontree, and\r\nthunderwood. It grows from New England to Georgia, and west to Minnesota\r\nand Louisiana. It is apt to occur in wet swamps, and Sargent pronounces\r\nit “one of the most dangerous plants of the North American flora.” A\r\nblack, lustrous varnish can be made of the acrid poisonous juice, and\r\nthis may sometime give the species a commercial value. When the skin is\r\npoisoned by contact with this tree, an effective remedy may be found in\r\na saturated alcoholic solution of acetate of lead, if applied as a wash\r\nwithin an hour or two after the poisoning occurs. A wash with pure\r\nalcohol is also effective if applied within an hour. Following either\r\ntreatment the skin should be thoroughly washed with soap and water.\r\nWestern sumach (_Rhus integrifolia_), a closely related California\r\nspecies, is a small evergreen, seldom more than twenty feet high and a\r\nfoot in diameter. The wood is heavy, hard, and red, is used as fuel, and\r\noccasionally in small turnery. The fruit is a berry half an inch long.\r\n\r\nCASCARA BUCKTHORN (_Rhamnus purshiana_) is of the buckthorn family, and\r\nis known by many names on the Pacific coast where the species is best\r\ndeveloped. It grows as far east as Colorado and Texas. Cascara sagrada,\r\nits Mexican name, is often used for this tree. It is known also as\r\nbearberry, bearwood, yellow-wood, pigeonberry, coffeeberry, bayberry,\r\nand California coffee. The tree’s usual size is from ten to thirty feet\r\nhigh and twelve to twenty inches in diameter. It is often shrubby, and\r\nis more valuable for its bark than its wood. Large quantities are peeled\r\nfor medicinal uses, and many trees are thus destroyed. A little of the\r\nwood is burned as fuel, and some is made into handles. Yellow buckthorn\r\n(_Rhamnus caroliniana_), with a range from New York to Texas, and\r\nevergreen buckthorn (_Rhamnus crocea_), a California species, are\r\nclosely related to cascara buckthorn, but are of comparatively little\r\nimportance. Blue myrtle (_Ceanothus thyrsiflorus_) is a California\r\nspecies, sometimes called wild lilac or blue blossoms. It ranges in\r\nheight from thirty-five feet, among the redwoods on the Santa Cruz\r\nmountains, to only one foot high on some of the wind-swept coasts. The\r\nwood is pale yellowish-brown, and is somewhat used for novelties. Tree\r\nmyrtle (_Ceanothus arboreus_), often known as lilac, is also a\r\nCalifornia tree, closely related to blue myrtle, but is of smaller size\r\nand of very restricted range. Its prospective value lies more in its\r\nbloom than in its wood. Naked-wood (_Colubrina reclinata_), a Florida\r\nspecies, is of a kindred genus. Trees are sometimes fifty feet high and\r\nthree in diameter. The wood is hard, very strong, and is dark brown\r\ntinged with yellow.\r\n\r\nLIGNUM-VITÆ (_Guajacum sanctum_) grows in Florida, and a species which\r\nis probably the same is found in south Texas along the Rio Grande. In\r\nTexas the tree is known as guayacon, which name has come down from the\r\ntimes when the Carib Indians ruled the West Indies. That was their name\r\nfor the tree. The annual rings are usually too vague and too involved to\r\nbe counted, but the tree is known to be of slow growth. The wood is\r\npitted and it contains cavities and creases; but the clear wood is very\r\nhard and of fine and various colors. It is dark green, brown, black,\r\nyellow and of mixed colors, and clouded effects, all in the same block.\r\nSmall pieces of furniture, like bureau cabinets, present attractive\r\ncombinations of colors. The wood is of such exceeding hardness that it\r\nturns, breaks, or batters the carpenter’s tools. Candlesticks, egg cups,\r\ngoblets, vases, checker pieces, dominos, boxes, trays, canes, paper\r\nknives, and souvenirs are manufactured in a small way. Trees attain a\r\nheight of thirty feet and a diameter of two or more. The compound leaves\r\nadhere to the branches until those of the following season appear. The\r\nfruit is an orange-colored pod three-fourths of an inch long.\r\n\r\nPRICKLY ASH (_Xanthoxylum clava-herculis_). Some know this species as\r\ntoothache tree, tear-blanket, sting-tongue, and Hercules’ club. The wood\r\nshows little difference in color between heartwood and sap, and bears\r\nsome resemblance to buckeye. It takes good polish and some of it looks\r\nlike birdseye maple, but the figure does not seem to be due to\r\nadventitious buds. It has been made into picture frames and looks well.\r\nIt is a rapid grower, and since its color fits it for the stencil, it\r\nmight be worthy of consideration for box material. Trees reach a height\r\nof twenty-five or thirty feet, and a diameter of a foot or more. Its\r\nrange extends from Virginia to Texas. Satinwood (_Xanthoxylum\r\ncribrosum_) is of the same genus, but it does not grow north of Florida\r\nwhere it is sometimes called yellow-wood. Mature trees are a foot or\r\nmore in diameter and twenty-five or thirty-five feet high; wood heavy,\r\nexceedingly hard and brittle, but not strong; color light orange. It has\r\nsome use as furniture material, and for certain classes of handles which\r\nneed not be strong. Wild lime (_Xanthoxylum fagara_) is a similar tree,\r\ngrowing in both Florida and Texas, but it is of small size. Hoptree\r\n(_Ptelea trifoliata_) is another member of the family. Its fruit is\r\nsometimes substituted for hops for brewing beer. It is known also as\r\nwafer ash, wahoo, and quinine tree; the last name being due to its\r\nbitter bark. It grows from Canada to Florida, and west to New Mexico,\r\nand seldom exceeds twenty feet in height. Baretta (_Helietta\r\nparvifolia_) which occurs as a small tree in southern Texas, is a near\r\nrelative. Torchwood (_Amyris maritima_), so named because of its fine\r\nproperties as fuel, grows in southern Florida, sometimes reaching a\r\nheight of forty feet and a diameter of one. Canotia (_Canotia\r\nholacantha_) is a small, scarce tree of Arizona and California and has\r\nfine-grained, rich brown wood.\r\n\r\nNANNYBERRY (_Viburnum prunifolium_), known as black haw, sloe,\r\nsheepberry, and stagbush, grows from Connecticut to Oklahoma and is\r\nusually a shrub which springs up along highways and hedges, but it\r\nsometimes reaches a height of twenty feet and a diameter of eight\r\ninches. It is valuable in some localities in the manufacture of canes\r\nand umbrella sticks. Rusty nannyberry (_Viburnum rufotomentosum_) is a\r\nsimilar species, but attains a larger size, and grows from Virginia to\r\nTexas. The wood may be known by its disagreeable odor. Sheepberry\r\n(_Vibernum lentago_) has a more northern range, from Quebec to\r\nSaskatchewan, and south along the mountains to Georgia.\r\n\r\nBLUE ELDER (_Sambucus glauca_) is one of three tree elders in the United\r\nStates, the others being Mexican elder (_Sambucus mexicana_) and\r\nred-berried elder (_Sambucus callicarpa_). They are ornamental rather\r\nthan useful. The three species occur on the Pacific coast. The largest\r\nrecorded size of an elder was forty feet high and twenty-eight inches in\r\ndiameter. Its age was about fifty years.\r\n\r\nFRINGE TREE (_Chionanthus virginica_) is known also as white fringe,\r\nAmerican fringe, white ash, old man’s beard, flowering ash, and\r\nsunflower tree. Its natural range extends from Pennsylvania to Florida\r\nand west to Texas, but it has been widely planted in this country and\r\nEurope. It is seldom more than twenty feet high and eight inches in\r\ndiameter. The bark possesses medicinal value. Devilwood (_Osmanthus\r\namericanus_) belongs to the same family, but to a different genus. It\r\ngrows from North Carolina to Florida and west to Louisiana. The largest\r\ntrunks are a foot in diameter and forty feet high. The wood is strong,\r\nheavy, hard, dark brown, and difficult to work.\r\n\r\nBLACK IRONWOOD (_Rhamnidium ferreum_) of Florida is among the heaviest,\r\nprobably is the heaviest, wood of the United States. It weighs 81.14\r\npounds per cubic foot, and when a hundred pounds of the wood is burned,\r\nit leaves eight pounds of ashes--the highest in ash of all woods of the\r\nUnited States. Its fuel value is very high. Trees are small, seldom more\r\nthan thirty feet high and six inches in diameter. Bluewood (_Condalia\r\nobovata_) is a related Texas species, called also logwood and purple\r\nhaw. It produces heavy, hard, close-grained wood, light red in color.\r\nTrees six inches in diameter and twenty-five feet high are fully up to\r\nthe average. Along the lower Rio Grande it forms dense, tangled\r\nthickets. Red ironwood (_Reynosia latifolia_) of southern Florida\r\nbelongs to a related species, and is sometimes called darling plum,\r\nbecause its purple fruit is edible. The tree is small, the wood heavy,\r\nhard, strong, and of rich brown color. White ironwood (_Hypelate\r\ntrifoliata_) belongs to a different family. It occurs in Florida where\r\ntrees are sometimes thirty-five feet high and eighteen inches in\r\ndiameter. The heavy, hard, rich brown wood is durable in contact with\r\nthe ground, and is used for fence posts, handles, and boats. Inkwood\r\n(_Exothea paniculata_) is of the same family as white ironwood but of a\r\ndifferent genus. It is also a Florida species and is known in some\r\nlocalities as ironwood. The tree is occasionally a foot in diameter and\r\nforty feet high, wood very hard, heavy, and strong, and bright red in\r\ncolor. It is used by boat builders, for wharfs, and as handle wood.\r\n\r\nCINNAMON BARK (_Canella winterana_), also called whitewood and wild\r\ncinnamon, is a south Florida species seldom more than twenty-five feet\r\nhigh and ten inches in diameter. The wood is exceedingly heavy, hard,\r\nand strong, and of dark reddish-brown color. The wild cinnamon bark of\r\ncommerce comes from this tree.\r\n\r\nJOEWOOD (_Jaquinia armillaris_) grows in the Florida everglades. The\r\ndark and beautiful medullary rays of this wood may sometime make it\r\nvaluable for turnery and small novelties. Trunks seldom exceed six or\r\nseven inches in diameter. Marlberry (_Icacorea paniculata_) belongs in\r\nthe same family with joewood. Trunks are small, but the hard, rich brown\r\nwood is beautifully marked with dark medullary rays.\r\n\r\nCRABWOOD (_Gymnanthes lucida_) is known chiefly by the fine canes made\r\nof it. The tree occurs in southern Florida where it is sometimes known\r\nas poisonwood. It is dark brown, streaked with yellow. Trunks more than\r\neight inches in diameter are unusual. Manchineel (_Hippomane\r\nmancinella_) is of the same family, and occurs in Florida. The wood is\r\nlight and soft.\r\n\r\nSINGLELEAF PINON (_Pinus monophylla_). This is the only pine in this\r\ncountry with single needles. They are one and one-half inches long, and\r\nare curved like the old fashioned sewing awl used by shoemakers. The\r\nneedles fall during the fourth and fifth years. The cones are one and\r\none-half or two and one-half inches long. The trees are small, averaging\r\nfifteen or twenty feet high and eight or twelve inches in diameter. Its\r\nrange covers portions of Utah, Arizona, Nevada, and California, but it\r\noccupies dry, sterile regions as nearly under desert conditions as can\r\nbe found in this country. The tree maintains a foothold on the eastern\r\nslope of the Sierra Nevada mountains at an altitude of 9,000 feet and it\r\ndescends into the Colorado desert in California at an elevation of 2,000\r\nfeet. It endures winter cold below zero on the mountains, and summer\r\ntemperature of 122 in the Mojave desert. It is fitted to live in a dry,\r\nsterile region. The leaves are small and the branches bear few of them.\r\nThe thin foliage uses little water, which is a fortunate circumstance,\r\nfor there is little to use. Slow growth is the result. The trunk often\r\nadds less than an inch to its diameter in twenty years. The trees form\r\nvery open forest, resembling old orchards, and the greenness usually\r\nassociated with pine landscapes is generally wanting. The singleleaf\r\npine has filled an important place in the development of the region, and\r\nfurnishes an example of the great service which a small, crooked tree\r\ncan give when it is the only one to be had. Mines worth many millions of\r\ndollars have been worked with little of any other wood. This has been\r\nthe fuel for the kitchen, the engine house, the blacksmith shop. It has\r\nsupplied the props, posts, stulls, and lagging for the underground\r\noperations. Fences for stock corrals, sheds, stables, cabins, and\r\nbridges have been constructed of the small, crooked trunks and the\r\ndistorted limbs, when no other wood could be had in fifty or a hundred\r\nmiles. Extensive tracts have been cut clean in the vicinity of mines.\r\nThe product of the singleleaf pine forest cannot be measured in board or\r\nlog feet, because of the smallness of the trunks and branches, but by\r\nthe cord. The wood is medium heavy, rather high in fuel value, very\r\nweak, brittle, and soft. The resin passages are few and small, color\r\nyellow or light brown, the sapwood nearly white. In contact with the\r\nsoil the wood is not durable, but its principal use has been in a very\r\ndry climate, and it lasts well there. It is the most important of the\r\nnut pines.\r\n\r\nIt produces enormous crops which are larger some years than others. John\r\nMuir believed that the singleleaf pinon’s annual nut yield surpassed\r\nCalifornia’s yield of wheat. Only a small part of the nut crop is ever\r\nput to use by man. Scattered over mountains, mesas, and deserts, 100,000\r\nsquare miles in extent, most of the nuts fall and decay, though the\r\nanimals of the rocks and sands, and the birds of the air live on them\r\nwhile they last. The Indians of the region long looked upon the nut\r\ncrop, as the Egyptians upon the overflow of the Nile--a guarantee\r\nagainst famine. The Indians are not so dependent on the nuts now as\r\nformerly because scattered settlements throughout the region supply\r\nother sources of food. Many nuts are still gathered, and are sold in\r\nstores from San Francisco to Denver. They look like peanuts, but are\r\nricher in oil, and if eaten raw they speedily cloy the appetite. The\r\nIndians usually roast them, and frequently crush them into meal. When\r\nthe harvest is ripe the Indians gather from all sides and camp during a\r\nmonth or more, thrash the cones from the trees with poles, extract the\r\nnuts, and keep up the operation until all present needs are supplied,\r\nand every available basket is filled for future use. The packhorses and\r\nburros of the mining country in Nevada where this pine grows, acquire a\r\nliking for the nuts. They are as nourishing as oats, and the pack\r\nanimals like them better. Indians do considerable business collecting\r\nthe nuts and selling them by the gunny sack to pack trains, for horse\r\nfeed. A single Indian will sometimes gather thirty or forty bushels, for\r\nwhich he can get a dollar a bushel when he has carried them to market.\r\n\r\nThe singleleaf pine’s future will be about as its past has been, as far\r\nas can now be foreseen. Little planting will ever be done, nor is it\r\nnecessary. Nature plants all that the sterile soil will support. It is\r\nof too slow growth to tempt the forester. A century is required to\r\nproduce a fence post, and 200 years for a crosstie. Forest fires do\r\nlittle injury, for the ground is generally so bare that fire dies out of\r\nits own accord in a short distance. The tree can never be planted much\r\nfor ornament. Even if it would grow outside of its dry habitat, it\r\npossesses no more beauty than a half-dead apple tree in a neglected\r\norchard. The trunks resemble mesquite in Texas; but the Texas tree is\r\nredeemed by the beauty of its foliage in summer, while the foliage of\r\nthe singleleaf pine is so pale and thin that it attracts no attention.\r\n\r\nCAROLINA HEMLOCK (_Tsuga caroliniana_) is of far less importance than\r\nits northern neighbor which goes south along the Appalachian mountains\r\nto meet it. The two species mingle on the mountain tops from\r\nsouthwestern Virginia to northern Georgia. The Carolina hemlock is\r\nusually confined to altitudes 2,500 or 3,000 feet above sea level, and\r\nprefers rocky banks of streams. It does not usually occur in dense\r\nstands of even moderate size, as the northern hemlock does. A few trees\r\nin clumps or scattered solitary represent its habit of growth. Typical\r\ndevelopment of the species occurs on the headwaters of the Savannah\r\nriver in South Carolina. For a long time this hemlock and its northern\r\nrelative were supposed to be the same. Botanists did not formerly\r\nseparate them, and the mountaineers do not generally do so now. There\r\nare several differences, however, which may be observed upon close\r\nexamination, and by comparing the two species. The Carolina hemlock’s\r\nleaves have more rows of stomata and therefore are a little whiter on\r\nthe under side. The leaves are also longer, and the cones are larger.\r\nThe tree does not attain the dimensions of the northern species, its\r\naverage size being forty or fifty feet in height, and two or less in\r\ndiameter. It is not abundant, and has never been and never can be much\r\nused for commercial purposes. It is an attractive park tree and has been\r\nwidely planted.\r\n\r\nLIMBER PINE (_Pinus flexilis_) owes its name to its long, drooping\r\nbranches. It is often called white pine, Rocky Mountain white pine,\r\nwestern white pine, and limber twig pine. It is not the tree usually\r\ncalled western white pine (_Pinus monticola_), but is a high mountain\r\nspecies, ranging from the Rocky Mountains of Montana to western Texas;\r\nit grows also on the mountains of Arizona, Utah, Nevada, and California.\r\nThe upper limit of its range in the Sierra Nevadas is 12,000 feet. It\r\ndescends to an altitude of only 4,000 feet in the Rocky Mountains, and\r\nforms open, scattered stands of round-topped trees of little commercial\r\nvalue, and is usually associated with western yellow pine or Rocky\r\nMountain cedar. At altitudes of 8,500 or 10,000 feet it is more stunted,\r\nand associates with Lyall larch and other high mountain species.\r\nIntermediate between its lower and its higher belts it produces a little\r\nmerchantable lumber. The wood is light, soft, medium brittle, of slow\r\ngrowth and with narrow bands of summerwood. The resin passages are large\r\nand numerous. The wood, when a choice trunk is found, resembles that of\r\neastern white pine; but generally the trunks are inferior in size and\r\nform. The heartwood is light, clear yellow, the sapwood nearly white.\r\nTrees range in height from thirty to fifty feet, and one to three in\r\ndiameter. A sawlog ten feet long is about as much as can be had from a\r\ntrunk, and of course, when compared with commercial trees, it holds a\r\nlow place; but in some remote mountain regions it is the principal wood\r\navailable, and to that extent it is of importance. When green, the wood\r\nis very heavy, and sometimes will sink. It is used for posts and in the\r\nmines. The farmer seasons posts on the stump. He peels the trees six\r\nmonths before cutting them. They immediately exude resin over the whole\r\npeeled surface, and the tree quickly dies. At the end of six months the\r\ntrunk is seasoned, and is cut for posts. The ends are smeared with\r\nresin. Such posts have lasted twenty years with little decay. Railroads\r\nmake ties of fire-killed limber pine. Charcoal burners use it also. The\r\ngrowing trees resist the fumes of copper smelters better than any other\r\nspecies associated with it.\r\n\r\n    PARRY PINON (_Pinus quadrifolia_). The names by which this tree is\r\n    known in the region where it grows indicate one of its leading\r\n    features, a bearer of nuts. It is called nut pine, Parry’s nut pine,\r\n    pinon, and Mexican pinon. The nuts exceed half an inch in length,\r\n    are reddish-brown, and the wings narrow and small. They cannot carry\r\n    the nuts far, and the species is not spreading. Reproduction takes\r\n    place beneath the parent tree, and frequently the old trunk dies\r\n    without having succeeded in planting a single seed to perpetuate the\r\n    species. The nuts are nutritious, and are eagerly sought by birds,\r\n    rodents, and larger animals, including human beings. The cones are\r\n    seldom two inches long, and the leaves are little more than an inch.\r\n    They are usually in clusters of four, and fall the third year. The\r\n    tree’s characteristics betray its environment. It is fitted for dry,\r\n    sterile situations. Its abnormally large seeds provide food for the\r\n    seedling until it can get its rootlets deep enough in the poor soil\r\n    to get a start. The Parry pinon’s range is confined to the extreme\r\n    southern part of California and to Lower California where it\r\n    occupies arid mesas and low mountain slopes. It is common on Santa\r\n    Rosa mountains, California, at an elevation of 5,000 feet. It is too\r\n    small to be worth much for lumber, the usual height being less than\r\n    thirty feet, the trunk diameter from ten to sixteen inches. The wood\r\n    is medium heavy, weak, low in elasticity, but rather high in fuel\r\n    value. The annual rings are very narrow, and the thin bands of\r\n    summerwood are not conspicuous. It is one of the slowest-growing of\r\n    the pines, and probably it is surpassed in that respect by lodgepole\r\n    pine alone. Its only uses are fuel, a few fence posts, and small\r\n    ranch timbers.\r\n\r\n    KNOBCONE PINE (_Pinus attenuata_). This pine is known as\r\n    prickly-cone pine, sun-loving pine, sunny-slope pine, narrow-cone\r\n    pine, and knobcone pine. Its leaves are in clusters of three, and\r\n    are four and five inches long. The cones are from three to six\r\n    inches long. They often adhere to the branches thirty or forty\r\n    years, and may become entirely overgrown and hidden by bark and\r\n    wood--hence the name knobcone. The wood is light, soft, weak,\r\n    brittle; the growth is slow and the annual rings are narrow. The\r\n    resin passages are large and numerous. The average height of the\r\n    mature knobcone pine is from twenty-five to forty feet, and the\r\n    trunk diameter eight to twelve inches. It grows on dry mountain\r\n    regions of California and Oregon, and is not a valuable timber tree.\r\n    A little is occasionally sawed in small dimensions, but the\r\n    principal use is for mine props. It is short lived, even when it\r\n    does not fall a victim to accidents. In accordance with the\r\n    provisions of nature, it prepares for early death by bearing seeds\r\n    when only five or six feet high. The cones act as storing places for\r\n    seed, sometimes during the whole life of the tree. Thus a knobcone\r\n    pine may hold in its tightly closed cones the seeds produced during\r\n    the tree’s whole life. When death overtakes it, the cones open and\r\n    scatter the seeds. The accumulated crops may total three or four\r\n    pounds of seeds. Fire usually kills the trees, but the heat is\r\n    generally not sufficient to burn the cones. When they open soon\r\n    after the fire has passed, they find a bared mineral soil ready to\r\n    receive them. The knobcone pine lives in adversity and usually dies\r\n    by violence.\r\n\r\n    ARIZONA PINE (_Pinus arizonica_). This tree is confined to the\r\n    mountains of southern Arizona at from 6,000 to 8,000 feet above sea\r\n    level. It is the prevailing pine near the summit of the Santa\r\n    Catalina mountains. Much of the timber is of small size and yields\r\n    only inferior lumber; but when larger trunks are obtainable, the\r\n    lumber grades with western yellow pine, and goes to market with it.\r\n    Arizona pine is medium light, soft, not strong, rather brittle, of\r\n    slow growth, with the summerwood comparatively broad and very\r\n    resinous; color, light red or often yellow, the sapwood lighter\r\n    yellow or white. The leaves are in clusters of five and are tufted\r\n    at the ends of the branches. They are from five to seven inches\r\n    long, and are deciduous the third year.\r\n\r\n    DWARF JUNIPER (_Juniperus communis_) is an interesting tree because\r\n    its range practically runs round the world in the north temperate\r\n    and frigid zones, but in the United States the only reported use of\r\n    the wood is in southern Illinois where it grows on the limestone\r\n    hills and is occasionally cut for fence posts. In nearly all other\r\n    parts of its range in this country it is little more than a shrub.\r\n    Some trees with a spread of limbs twenty feet across are only three\r\n    or four feet high. The seeds mature slowly, not ripening until the\r\n    third year; and they often hang a year or two after ripening. The\r\n    wood is narrow-ringed, hard, very durable in contact with the soil,\r\n    of light brown color, with pale sapwood. In Europe the aromatic\r\n    fruit of this tree is used in large quantities to flavor gin, but\r\n    there is no report that it has been so employed in this country. In\r\n    the United States it occurs in Pennsylvania and northward, and\r\n    northward from Illinois, and throughout the Rocky Mountains north of\r\n    Texas. It occurs on the Pacific coast north of California. It grows\r\n    from Greenland to Alaska, and through Siberia, and northern Europe.\r\n\r\n    DROOPING JUNIPER (_Juniperus flaccida_) is confined in the United\r\n    States to the Chisos mountains in western Texas, but grows in\r\n    Mexico. The tree attains a height of thirty feet and a diameter of\r\n    one. Its name refers to its graceful branches. It has been planted\r\n    in this country less than in southern Europe and northern Africa.\r\n    The bark is light cinnamon-brown, and easily separates in loose,\r\n    papery scales. The lumberman will never go far to procure drooping\r\n    juniper logs. They are too small, scarce, and of form too poor. The\r\n    wood has the usual characteristics of the junipers which grow in\r\n    western mountains. It looks more like alligator juniper than any\r\n    other. In Texas it goes to the lathe to be manufactured into\r\n    candlesticks, pin boxes, picture molding, and other articles of\r\n    turnery.\r\n\r\n    UTAH JUNIPER (_Juniperus utahensis_) is known also as juniper,\r\n    desert juniper, and western red cedar. The last name is properly\r\n    applied to a different tree in Washington and Oregon. The Utah\r\n    juniper occupies the great basin between the Rocky Mountains and the\r\n    Sierra Nevadas, particularly in Utah, Nevada, California, Arizona,\r\n    and Colorado. It thrives best about 8,000 feet above the sea, but\r\n    descends to 5,000 feet or less. It is a desert tree, usually small,\r\n    often a mere shrub, but occasionally attaining a height of twenty\r\n    feet or more and a diameter of one or two. The trunk is irregular in\r\n    shape, and is generally deeply fluted. The wood is light brown in\r\n    color, though it varies greatly in different specimens, and even in\r\n    the same tree. The sapwood is thick and nearly white. The tree has\r\n    not been much used except for fence posts and fuel. The Indians of\r\n    the region eat the berries raw or bake them in cakes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX TO COMMON NAMES\r\n\r\n\r\n  Acacia, 535\r\n  African mahogany, 463\r\n  Ailanthus, 676\r\n  Alaska
