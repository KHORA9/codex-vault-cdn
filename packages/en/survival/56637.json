But if such proof is not\r\nforthcoming, they adhere—in preference to groping in the dark—to\r\nNature’s own methods, knowing from experience, that when allowed full\r\nscope and fair treatment, it is most sure in all its ways. That will\r\nnot prevent them, however, from giving in the future, as they have\r\ndone in the past, the question of sewage treatment in all its aspects\r\ntheir most careful consideration.\r\n\r\n  ALFRED S.

ALFRED S. JONES, V.C.\r\n  ASSOC. M. INST. C.E., ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Introductory remarks.]\r\n\r\n“How extremely simple it all is!” was the remark of a recent visitor\r\nat a sewage farm—which encourages me to venture on publication of the\r\nmost recent discussions on a “problem” complicated by engineers,\r\nchemists, bacteriologists and inventors of systems, who have raised\r\nclouds of dust through which it is difficult for ratepayers and\r\ndistrict councillors to find their way to “the best practical and\r\navailable means of sewage disposal.”\r\n\r\nI have a belief that publication of all attempts to purify _the whole_\r\nof a town’s sewage, rather than small scale experiments with equations\r\nfounded on such data, is the desideratum.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1872.]\r\n\r\nHaving begun in the year 1872, with a pamphlet, “Will a Sewage Farm\r\nPay?”[2] I desire to proceed with the present one thirty years later,\r\nas my humble contribution to a right understanding of the intelligent\r\nScavenger’s business.\r\n\r\nAt the earlier date agriculture was prosperous, and ratepayers of\r\nExeter were just as confident that sewage farming would bring large\r\ndividends as some of the same city’s councillors are at present not in\r\nthe least sceptical that their engineer’s septic system is the true\r\nspecific for sewage disposal.\r\n\r\nIn adhering to land as the natural and best agent, I have had the\r\nsupport of the Local Government Board with that of many Royal\r\nCommissions, notably the one now sitting, and I have naturally chosen\r\ncases where suitable land was accessible when I desired to demonstrate\r\nthe efficiency and simplicity with which the powers of Nature can be\r\napplied for the use and convenience of man.\r\n\r\nNor have I failed to study all “artificial” substitutes for the best\r\nmeans, wherever difficulties of obtaining suitable land presented\r\nthemselves, e.g. my Canvey Island scheme for dealing with the sewage\r\nof London on a relatively small area, and other cases.\r\n\r\nOf late years I have welcomed the light thrown on this subject by\r\nbacteriologists, but lamented extravagant statements put forward by\r\nthose who fail to see that the previously unrecognised microbes can do\r\ntheir work, as they have always done it, to most advantage in the\r\nupper layers of any porous land.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1902.]\r\n\r\nAn interim report by Lord Iddesleigh’s Royal Commission has, however,\r\nawakened such theorists to the fact that land is not to be discarded\r\nbecause it may not bring in a profit or because patentees of systems\r\nfind it to their interest to contrast neglected or badly managed\r\nsewage farms with carefully nursed little experimental installations\r\nfor artificial treatment of selected samples of sewage.\r\n\r\nRecognising the marvellous improvements in arts and manufactures of\r\nall kinds due to steam, chemistry and electricity, the public has\r\nnaturally expected similar results from applied science in artificial\r\nsewage treatment, and there has been no lack of study of every\r\nimaginable process during the last thirty years.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1884. Lord Bramwell’s Royal Commission establishes\r\nprinciples.]\r\n\r\nBut the late Lord Bramwell’s Royal Commission on Metropolitan Sewage\r\nDischarge established two very important points of general\r\napplication, namely:—\r\n\r\n1. The principle of separation in works of sewerage and drainage; and\r\n\r\n2. The fact that the suspended matters in town sewage can be very\r\neffectually removed from its liquid by _simple deposition_ without the\r\naid of any chemical reagent.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1887. The chemist Dibdin discards chemical reagents in\r\nfavour of M. Pasteur’s aerobic organisms.]\r\n\r\nAnd Mr. Dibdin three years later began to demonstrate the mistaken\r\npolicy of adding lime or any other precipitating agent in any quantity\r\nlikely to arrest the natural agency of abundant bacterial life, which\r\nultimately disposes of all dead and effete organic matter by forming\r\ngases or natural compounds, with more or less offence to human senses,\r\naccording to the supply of oxygen and rate at which these bacteria can\r\ncarry out their work.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Leeds and Exeter.]\r\n\r\nIt was soon found that the bacteria of two classes, aerobe and\r\nanaerobe, abound in sewage, and the latest Leeds experiment with the\r\ncontinuous or trickling filter show the marvellous rapidity with which\r\nthe _aerobic_ microbes at any rate, can accomplish their task where\r\nair and liquid sewage are sufficiently diffused in the pores of a\r\nfilter; while Mr. Cameron, C.E., at Exeter has shown rapid evolution\r\nof gases and considerable solution of organic solids by _anaerobic_\r\nmicrobes in a septic tank.\r\n\r\nBut the enthusiasm of inventors and their converts has made too much\r\nof the benefit to the human race supposed to be conferred by the\r\nbacterial discovery of M. Pasteur as applied by them to sewage\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\nWithout detracting from the credit due to the great French savant and\r\nother bacteriologists who have followed up his interesting studies of\r\nferments for the last fifteen years, the practical man may well ask\r\nhow much forwarder have we got in the main and pressing business of\r\npurifying our rivers—as a consequence of clearer knowledge of minute\r\nforms of life?\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Intermittent filtration.]\r\n\r\nThe late civil engineer Bailey-Denton demonstrated, thirty years ago\r\nat Merthyr Tydvil, the best conditions of intermittent downward\r\nfiltration, and his filters there and at Kendal, Abingdon, etc., are\r\nstill doing their work efficiently to this day, while the coke, coal,\r\nclinker, burnt ballast, etc., beds, so popular of late, are clogging\r\nup after a few years of more careful treatment than was ever accorded\r\nto an acre of land under sewage.\r\n\r\nAnaerobic action has also been proceeding in the old sewers of most\r\ntowns and, as it has now been proved that there is no advantage in the\r\nexclusion of air, upon which Mr. Cameron laid so much stress when he\r\nbrought his Exeter tank to public notice in 1897, there can be no\r\nnovelty except its name attaching to the anaerobic or _septic_ system,\r\nwhich has thrown many sanitary authorities off their balance of late\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nThe whole modern system of self-cleansing sewers having been only\r\nrendered possible by public recognition of the horrible nuisance\r\narising from middens, cesspools, and irregularly built sewers of\r\ndeposit, it is hard for those concerned in the cleanly disposal of\r\nsewage to be told that because sewage works are usually remote from\r\npopulous districts they must there put up with the cesspool nuisance\r\nand fancy its old smell changed by the new name, because a preliminary\r\nstage in the transmutation of sewage has not taken place, as was\r\nformerly the case in the sewerage system of some modern towns, before\r\narrival at the works.\r\n\r\nBut in this as in other affairs there is force in the old maxim,\r\n_Medio tutissimus ibis_, and a properly constructed open tank, for\r\nsimple deposition of the solids (frequently washed out), arrests most\r\nof the solids and allows fresh liquid sewage, after slight anaerobic\r\naction, to pass on to land or filter bed in a perfectly inoffensive\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The cleanly and dirty processes for sludge removal.]\r\n\r\nAs an example of this I have, at Aldershot, a pair of tanks close to a\r\npublic high road, one of which fills with sludge and is emptied every\r\nfortnight or so, and as a contrast there is another pair of larger\r\ntanks in a remote quarter of the same farm in use for years as septic\r\ntanks, from which some sludge is drawn off at long intervals,\r\nanaerobic action being allowed its full course as in the Exeter\r\nexperiments.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to compare the results of these preliminary clean,\r\nand dirty, processes respectively on similar _very fresh_ domestic\r\nsewage which enters the clean depositing, and the septic tanks alike,\r\nand my observations are as follows:—\r\n\r\n1. The manurial result in growth of crop _slightly_ greater with the\r\nseptic liquid.\r\n\r\n2. Labour increased by the greater deposit carried on to the land\r\nunder septic liquid.\r\n\r\n3. The removal of sludge and washing out the clean tank gives an\r\nhour’s work with very little smell ten yards to leeward of the site,\r\nbut drawing off sludge from the septic tank is a very unpleasant\r\noperation, and, at all times, the vicinity of tank and carriers is\r\nmalodorous for a radius of at least fifty yards from the septic tanks.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Loam on sand and gravel the best medium for aerobic\r\norganisms to work in.]\r\n\r\nPassing now to the aerobic stage of sewage purification we find it\r\nuniversally admitted, that a good loam resting on very porous sand or\r\ngravel, affords the best medium for work by the oxygen-loving\r\nnitrifying organisms when they are supplied with constantly moving\r\nliquid sewage, and given intermittent periods for the aeration of the\r\npores of the soil.\r\n\r\nThe proportion of sewage to land is of course as variable as the\r\nquality of the land itself, and the best sort of land is rarely\r\navailable, while the improvement of natural land is not understood by\r\nthe engineer or chemist, who are usually appealed to by sanitary\r\nauthorities in their sewage difficulties.\r\n\r\nHence the variety of artificial substitutes of contact beds, costing\r\nfrom 5000_l._ to 12,000_l._ per acre, which have been proposed of late\r\nyears, with the object of purifying a large volume of sewage on a\r\nsmall area.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Leeds experiments.]\r\n\r\nMr. Dibdin first startled the world with the formula 1,000,000 gallons\r\nper acre, but that has long been cut down to 200,000 gallons, and the\r\nlife of the contact bed has become the subject of serious concern, as\r\nshown in the annexed table of experiment at Leeds.\r\n\r\nOthers have sought to increase the proportion of sewage to area by\r\narranging for _continuous_ instead of _intermittent_ application; but\r\nthe difficulty of sprinkling so that every part of a bed may be kept\r\njust moist, in order that aeration may be continuous as well as the\r\ndropping sewage, is very great, and increases with every gallon and\r\nfoot from the scale of a laboratory experiment to that of a practical\r\nworking for a town’s sewage.\r\n\r\nThere was an article published a few years ago in the Journal Royal\r\nAgricultural Society (England) on “The Making of the Land,” showing\r\nhow nearly all the value of agricultural land in England has been\r\nstored up in it by the exertions of our forefathers, through a process\r\nof successive improvements from, in many cases, worthless sand and\r\nclay, to a condition of the greatest fertility; and I often think that\r\nthe 12,000_l._ spent at Birmingham or elsewhere on an acre of contact\r\nbed could be expended to better purpose in preparing 100 acres of the\r\nworst land to deal, for any number of years, with as much sewage as\r\nthe contact bed may do for a few years. In the one case we know no\r\nlimit to the life of the purifier, and that it must be a very short\r\none in the other case.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE SHOWING THE VARIATIONS IN CAPACITY OF CONTACT BEDS.\r\n\r\n  -------------------------+--------------------+-------------------+\r\n                           |    No. 1 Rough     |   No. 3 Rough     |\r\n                           |    Contact Bed.    |   Contact Bed.    |\r\n  -------------------------+---------+----------+--------+----------+\r\n                           |  Dates. | Gallons. | Dates. | Gallons. |\r\n  -------------------------+---------+----------+--------+----------+\r\n  Original water capacity }|   1897. |          | 1898.  |          |\r\n    after putting         }|October 1| 83,300   |Nov. 21 |  51,800  |\r\n    in the coke           }|         |          |        |          |\r\n                           |  1899.  |          | 1900.  |          |\r\n  After experiment         |  May 6  | 22,700   |March 10|  14,700  |\r\n                           |         |          |        |          |\r\n  -------------------------+---------+----------+--------+----------+\r\n  Duration of each of   }  |         |          |        |          |\r\n    above experiments   }  |19 months|  60,600  |   25½  |  37,100  |\r\n    and loss in gallons }  |         |          |  mths. |          |\r\n                           |         |          |        |          |\r\n  Loss in percentage of }  |                    |                   |\r\n    original capacity   }  |    73 per cent.    |    71 per cent.   |\r\n  -------------------------+--------------------+-------------------+\r\n\r\n\r\n  ------------------------+----------------+----------------+-----------------+\r\n                          |  No. 5 Rough   |  No. 7 Single  |  No. 8 Single   |\r\n                          |  Contact Bed.  |  Contact Bed.  |  Contact Bed.   |\r\n  ------------------------+-------+--------+-------+--------+--------+--------+\r\n                          |Dates. |Gallons.| Dates.|Gallons.| Dates. |Gallons.|\r\n  ------------------------+-------+--------+-------+--------+--------+--------+\r\n  Original water capacity}| 1899. |        | 1899. |        |  1899. |        |\r\n    after putting        }|Feb. 28| 53,100 | March | 75,000 |March 23| 29,500 |\r\n    in the coke          }|       |        |   24  |        |        |        |\r\n                          | 1900. |        | 1900. |        | 1900.  |        |\r\n  After experiment        |June 1 | 13,200 |October| 21,600 | June 1 |  9,800 |\r\n                          |       |        |   20  |        |        |        |\r\n  ------------------------+-------+--------+-------+--------+--------+--------+\r\n  Duration of each of   } |       |        |       |        |        |        |\r\n    above experiments   } |  15   | 39,900 |   7   | 34,100 |   14   | 19,700 |\r\n    and loss in gallons } |months |        | months|        | months |        |\r\n                          |       |        |       |        |        |        |\r\n  Loss in percentage of } |                |                |                 |\r\n    original capacity   } |   75 per cent. |  61 per cent.  |   67 per cent.  |\r\n  ------------------------+----------------+----------------+-----------------+\r\n\r\n_N.B._—The average duration of the above experiments was 14 months,\r\nand average loss of capacity about 70 per cent. original water\r\ncapacity in that period.—A. S. J.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Wrexham sewage farm.]\r\n\r\nAt Wrexham, in North Wales, I had nineteen years’ management of about\r\n150 acres of good land, with a mixed residential and manufacturing\r\nsewage of some 15,000 population, with large breweries and leather\r\nworks. The owner of this land at the termination of lease asked so\r\nexorbitant a price for the improved freehold, that the corporation\r\ndecided to sacrifice the sewage works on his land, and to carry out a\r\nscheme of mine for carrying the outfall sewer two miles further to a\r\nsite of 200 acres, which they could acquire on reasonable terms in the\r\nyear 1889.\r\n\r\nDuring my management there was no trouble about the effluent, although\r\nit was carefully watched by the authorities of the city of Chester,\r\nwhich takes its water supply from the river Dee, some twelve miles\r\nbelow my late farm; and the fact that the scheme which took the\r\nWrexham sewage two miles nearer to the Chester waterworks intake was\r\ncarried out _unopposed_ is, I think, strong evidence of well-founded\r\nconfidence in the efficiency of land treatment where the public have\r\nthe opportunity of observing such results. It is easy to get up a case\r\nwith expert evidence against any sewage scheme where the land-owners,\r\nclergy and others have no means of properly informing themselves, and\r\nhave a prejudice against sewage which it is very difficult to overcome\r\nexcept by giving the utmost possible publicity to the truth.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Camp Farm, Aldershot.]\r\n\r\nOf late years, while working for the War Department, I have found it\r\nexpedient to be more reticent, but the Camp Farm restoration has in\r\none way or another become known to the public, and there can be no\r\ngreat harm in my now referring to the circumstances as neither martial\r\nlaw nor a censorship has yet been proclaimed in Hampshire.\r\n\r\nWhen Aldershot Camp was first hutted, soon after the Crimean War, a\r\ncertain Colonel Ewart, R.E., had imbibed true ideas of the separate\r\nsystem through his association with the work of the late Mr. Menzies,\r\nthe Deputy Ranger of Windsor Forest, who preached and practised that\r\nsystem in the drainage of Windsor Castle and the town of Eton at a\r\ntime when every other civil engineer scouted the possibility of\r\nkeeping rain or subsoil water out of foul sewers—they said it was\r\nessential for flushing their big sewers.\r\n\r\nColonel Ewart, at any rate, impressed his corps, and after about 1866\r\none began to see the word FOUL painted up over gratings into which the\r\nsoldiers were to pour their slops. A civilian, James Blackburn, also a\r\nfriend of Menzies, was employed by the War Office to deal with the\r\ncamp sewage on about 100 acres of rough heather-covered land close by,\r\nand he, knowing his business, watched what came down the sewers in wet\r\nweather and kept the Royal Engineers up to the Menzies standard.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Blackburn’s successful management.]\r\n\r\nTogether with this initial advantage of having a regular volume of\r\nsewage not much affected by storm water to deal with, Mr. Blackburn\r\nhad many drawbacks in the “pan,” as it is usually called, of iron\r\nconglomerate underlying the very irregular surface which was pitted\r\nall over with holes from which gravel or sand had been dug many years\r\nago; but he persevered until he had got nearly all the area to bear\r\ngood crops, when he entered the Camp Farm in competition for the Royal\r\nAgricultural Society’s 100_l._ prize in 1879 for the best managed\r\nsewage farm in the United Kingdom. The Report of the Judges at that\r\ncompetition is recorded in the Society’s Proceedings 1880, giving full\r\nstatistics except financial accounts, which Mr. Blackburn withheld\r\nbecause he was then in treaty with the War Office for new terms after\r\nfourteen years’ work on the War Department Farm. My impression after\r\nreading the judges’ reports and having seen the farm a year or two\r\npreviously to its date, is that, if the condition as to the production\r\nof the financial accounts could have been fulfilled, the first prize\r\nwould have been awarded to the Camp Farm instead of jointly to those\r\nof Bedford and to Wrexham.\r\n\r\nMr. Blackburn had built a big wooden shed and sublet it to a man who\r\nbought his ryegrass for some fifty cows (for whose milk there was a\r\ngreat demand in the camp), so this subtenant made a tempting offer to\r\nthe War Office and got a fourteen years’ lease of the whole farm,\r\nwhile Blackburn retired in disgust.\r\n\r\nI wish to write only from knowledge of facts, and will therefore take\r\nup my narrative again in 1895, after an interval of some fifteen\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Neglected state of, in 1895.]\r\n\r\nIn the month of May 1895, I was called upon to visit the Camp Farm and\r\nreport to Mr. Henry Campbell-Bannerman, the Secretary of State for War\r\nat that date.\r\n\r\nI found the whole farm in a deplorable condition of neglected\r\nnuisance, stagnant lakes of sewage retained here and there by banks of\r\nearth, buildings and fences in decay, and the greater part of the camp\r\nsewage passing, by pipes laid by its tenant, under a road which forms\r\nthe lower boundary of War Department land, to some rough meadows held\r\nby their tenant from civilian owners for the purpose of saving him the\r\ntrouble of spreading the sewage over the sloping surface of the War\r\nDepartment Farm—work which required the use of a land surveyor’s level\r\nand staff.\r\n\r\nIn the ditches of these flat meadows the sewage could go through the\r\nseptic process to its fullest extent as the level of the river\r\nBlackwater kept them nearly full at all times, and the supernatant\r\nliquid could spread over the coarse herbage of these meadows only in\r\nwinter floods, with the result of heavy crops of hay, and sewage\r\ndisposal conveniently out of sight and outside War Office jurisdiction\r\nwhen a Royal Engineer officer might come to inspect the Camp Farm from\r\ntime to time.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _British Medical Journal’s_ report.]\r\n\r\nBut before my visit an active Medical Officer of Health (Dr. Seaton),\r\ntaking an interest in the state of the river bounding his county of\r\nSurrey, detected the camp origin of the stagnant sewage, and,\r\nconcluding that the meadows must form part of the Camp Farm over the\r\nroad, made a serious report about “Government Sewage Marshes,” which\r\nthe _British Medical Journal_ took as a text for an article, and the\r\nThames Conservancy attacked the War Department as soon as their 1894\r\nAct gave them jurisdiction in the matter.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Temporary abatement of nuisance.]\r\n\r\nI was told that the Camp Farm milk and grass had been condemned, and\r\nthat the tenant had consequently sold his cows and was to give up the\r\nfarm on June 20, 1895; therefore my report was wanted _forthwith_,\r\nbut it was only to take account of anything which could be done\r\n_temporarily_ to abate nuisance, as an agreement was pending with the\r\nAldershot District Council for the removal of the camp sewage outfall\r\nto some site, at least two miles distant from the camp, at which the\r\nDistrict Council was to become solely responsible for its future\r\ndisposal, together with their own Aldershot town sewage, and the War\r\nDepartment to be rated for the purpose like any other householder.\r\n\r\nI found the Commanding Royal Engineer then in office fully alive to\r\nthe existing nuisance and prepared to support any efforts I might make\r\nto abate it. Accordingly I agreed to become manager in control of such\r\nlabour and material as was necessary for immediate temporary\r\nimprovement, and being supplied with army horses, and any necessary\r\nbuildings, tanks, etc. to be constructed by the Royal Engineers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1897. The War Office resolve on permanent improvement.]\r\n\r\nAfter about two years it became understood that the nuisance could be\r\npermanently remedied on the Camp Farm, as I had said from the first,\r\nand accordingly the draft agreement, which had then been in discussion\r\nfor five years, was abandoned. I was asked to prepare a scheme and\r\nestimate for such permanent works as would enable the sewage to be\r\neffectually disposed of on the Camp Farm.\r\n\r\nRecollecting that the sewage had to be at once cut off from Dr.\r\nSeaton’s “Sewage Marsh,” and its disposal provided for throughout on\r\nWar Department land, it will be observed that the improvement work had\r\nto proceed piecemeal with some extra care and arrangement; but on the\r\nwhole I am satisfied that the work has been completed with greater\r\nefficiency and economy than would have been the case if the sewage had\r\nbeen turned into the river and the whole site handed over to a\r\ncontractor for two years in the usual course.\r\n\r\nAbout the same date (end of 1897) about 13 acres of land was handed\r\nover to my management with sewage from the Royal Military and Staff\r\nColleges at Sandhurst, about 8 miles distant from the Camp Farm, and,\r\nbeing somewhat better land to begin with, this part now presents a\r\nvery pretty example of what a small installation for about 1000\r\npopulation may accomplish.\r\n\r\nBut it is worked as part and parcel of the Camp Farm, horses being\r\nsent out to Sandhurst from Monday to Saturday when required.\r\n\r\nIt is, perhaps, worthy of note that the reform of the Camp Farm was\r\ninitiated in 1895 by the Secretary of State for War in a Liberal\r\nMinistry, and that it has weathered for seven years all the storms of\r\nJingoism and the fashionable crazes for artificial sewage treatment.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sir Redvers Buller’s period of command at Aldershot.]\r\n\r\nBut whatever may be the rights or wrongs of General Sir Redvers\r\nBuller’s quarrel with the Press and the Government, his reputation as\r\na practical agriculturist is undeniable, and while in command at\r\nAldershot it was his custom to stroll over the Camp Farm on a Sunday\r\nafternoon, occasionally leaving a message with cowman or bailiff to\r\nwarn me of anything he found amiss, for which I was very grateful,\r\nliving as I do ten miles away. I am proud, therefore, to be able to\r\npublish the following letter from one who has shown that he is not to\r\nbe influenced by complaisance to superior or inferior in expressing or\r\nmodifying his opinions, and he writes as follows:—\r\n\r\n     17 LOWNDES SQUARE, S.W.\r\n     _July 14, 1902._\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR JONES,\r\n\r\n     I am delighted to hear that you are publishing a book about\r\n     sewage treatment.\r\n\r\n     The sewage farms at Aldershot and the Royal Military College\r\n     afford ample proof of what a sensible practical man can do.\r\n     But it is not every one who knows what those farms were\r\n     before you took charge of them, nor do I think that any one\r\n     seeing them now could conceive their previous condition. It\r\n     is to that I can testify; you have turned putrid sewage bogs\r\n     into fertile fields. You will confer an immense benefit on\r\n     the country if, by your book, you can only teach sanitary\r\n     authorities generally that the crux of the whole question is\r\n     the necessity for practical commonsense measures against\r\n     sewage stagnation, and if those measures are taken nature\r\n     will do the work of purification without the assistance of\r\n     expensive patents or artificial devices.\r\n\r\n     Yours very truly,\r\n\r\n     (_Signed_)      REDVERS BULLER.\r\n\r\n     _To_ COL. A. S. JONES, V.C., C.E.\r\n\r\nIt must not be gathered from the foregoing account that the War Office\r\nauthorities are prejudiced in favour of the _natural_ treatment of\r\nsewage, for, like many other sanitary authorities, they have been\r\nbewildered of late years by the numerous forms of “_artificial_”\r\ntreatment in vogue, and I know of more than one experimental\r\ninstallation for barracks where good available land has been\r\nneglected, for I read last summer of ghastly failures among the\r\nbacterial arrangements in some of those.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Success mainly due to activity of farm bailiff, foremen and\r\nother workers.]\r\n\r\nI cannot quit the above account of the vicissitudes of the Camp Farm\r\nin fourteen years’ growth from a sandy waste to a condition which\r\ntempted a tenant to pay a rent of 3_l._ odd per acre in 1880—its\r\nretrogression to its primitive waste during the following fifteen\r\nyears—and restoration to its present measure of fertility, without\r\nexpressing the belief that Mr. Blackburn’s success and my own have\r\nbeen mainly due to our good fortune in obtaining the willing services\r\nof excellent intelligent foremen and workers who, one and all, have\r\ntaken a real interest in their several tasks.\r\n\r\nMr. Cameron and other engineers may boast of their labour saving (?)\r\nautomatic appliances for opening and shutting valves on sewage works,\r\nbut practical workers, responsible for dealing with a million gallons\r\na day and upwards average, in hourly varying flow of town sewage, will\r\nagree with me in hesitation as to placing entire confidence in the\r\nsubstitution of automatic machines for any large proportion of their\r\nmanual labour.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Education and encouragement of sewage employees advocated.]\r\n\r\nI have for many years advocated education of sewage farm managers and\r\nwatermen, to be selected from the rapidly decreasing class of\r\nagricultural labourers by the tender of high wages, houses and good\r\ngardens, with other profit-sharing allowances which it will well pay\r\nsanitary authorities to hold out to their sewage employees.\r\n\r\nIn this sense I am glad to note the recent formation of “_The\r\nAssociation of Managers of Sewage Disposal Works_,” Secretary, Charles\r\nH. Ball, 5 Fetter Lane, London, E.C., as a Trades Union move from\r\nwithin well calculated to raise the status of the class of men upon\r\nwhose exertions the community must mainly rely if there is to be any\r\nhope of improving the condition of our streams and rivers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Evidence and Reports of Lord Iddesleigh’s Royal\r\nCommission.]\r\n\r\nTwo large Blue Books containing the evidence taken by Lord\r\nIddesleigh’s Royal Commission have been published since the Interim\r\nReport, and their contents more than warrant the opinion expressed in\r\nthe latter; indeed it must surely be admitted that the case for each\r\nof the artificial systems was very fully gone into before that\r\nCommission expressed the guarded conclusion, “We doubt if any land is\r\nentirely useless.”\r\n\r\nI do not believe that the surface purification obtained by\r\ndistribution over even the densest of clay lands was _effectively_ put\r\nin evidence, and too much weight was given to the difficulty of\r\nincreasing the effective top soil on such land; but on the whole I\r\nthink that the Interim Report is very satisfactory to the reasonable\r\nadvocates of a preference being given to the adoption of a large area\r\nof land, where available, over any artificial treatment on a small\r\narea, other things being equal.\r\n\r\nAt the time when the Interim Report was issued, however, a very full\r\nand careful examination of a select number of sewage farms was still\r\nin progress, and Appendix 22, with a casual mention by Dr. M’Gowan,\r\naffords the only glimpse to be had in the bulky Blue Books, of any\r\nresults of that examination having been as yet adduced in evidence.\r\n\r\nThe Commission’s officers, to my knowledge, were engaged for many\r\nmonths in examining, surveying and taking numerous samples of sewage\r\nand effluent at the Camp Farm, and, as they doubtless had equal\r\nopportunities of independent observations on the other selected sewage\r\nfarms, the further reports of Lord Iddesleigh’s Royal Commission\r\ncannot fail to be interesting and instructive.\r\n\r\nOn one point Appendix 22 to the Blue Book abundantly supports an\r\nopinion I have so often expressed, namely, that a good strong loamy\r\nsurface is a more efficient purifier of sewage than many feet of\r\nbarren sand.\r\n\r\nI refer to the curves in Appendix 22, showing the greatly superior\r\npurification effected at Nottingham with the best soil as compared to\r\nthat of the sandy one at Aldershot, which, in its natural character,\r\nis about the worst for purification and for producing crops to be\r\nfound in England.\r\n\r\nMy experience, however, all points to the extreme importance of\r\nstudying local conditions from the first inception of plans in each\r\nparticular case, to their completion with the best available\r\nmaterials.\r\n\r\nBut when the engineer has done his best, the sanitary authorities,\r\nhaving borrowed the funds to pay for the work, will take no further\r\ntrouble about its sewage, and will often engage careless ignorant\r\nworkpeople at inadequate wages to carry on the hourly varying labour,\r\non efficient performance of which success depends.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Automatic appliances for sewage and effluent discharge.]\r\n\r\nIt may seem idle to complain of boards and their employees showing\r\nlittle interest in the work of sewage disposal, but it is worse to\r\npander to their failings by selling them automatic machines under the\r\npretence that all the thought, and fertility of resource, required for\r\nefficient sanitary sewage disposal can be supplied by ingenious\r\napplications of hydraulics on the principle that sewage is a fluid,\r\nand, as such, will behave like clean water.\r\n\r\nOf course, when the aerobic treatment is carried out on a bare level\r\nsurface of cinders or coke growing only weeds, the lack of interest is\r\nvery excusable, but in the natural system the growth of crops and\r\ncontouring a sloping surface with carriers so that every part shall\r\nhave its trickling water alternating with dry periods for cutting the\r\ncrops or hoeing out weeds, should be a matter of constant interest to\r\nan agricultural worker, and, if he knows his business, good crops and\r\npurity of effluent must go together.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Managers should have a free hand.]\r\n\r\nIn order to attain this happy result, a manager must know his business\r\nand be given a free hand, not pestered by members of a committee\r\n(farmers, butchers, gardeners or town tradesmen) coming to give their\r\nadvice or orders. The river authority should take samples as often as\r\nthey like and send the manager as soon as possible the analyses with\r\nday and hour of sampling as a guide for future working.\r\n\r\nHe will then have to explain any defect from average purity of\r\neffluent, due to one of the hundred contingencies which may arise in\r\npractice, after he and the river authorities have agreed about what\r\nthat average analysis should be for his particular farm or works; and\r\nit will be for the advantage of all parties not to try and enforce a\r\nfixed standard for a whole district, as some river authorities usually\r\nattempt to do, because it is easier to lead than to drive a good\r\nmanager, and nothing at all can be done with a bad one.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that I think river authorities should be easy\r\ngoing, quite the contrary, but they should trust their inspectors’\r\nreports, and “run in” those sanitary authorities who are careless\r\nabout the management of their sewage farms and trying to cut down\r\nworking expenses and capital.\r\n\r\nIn precipitation or other artificial sewage works it is easy to judge\r\nthis, but more difficult for any one except the good farm manager to\r\nknow whether the land is being made the most of for profit or for\r\npurification; still the rivers authority ought to get to know if they\r\nand their officers take pains.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Purification and profit.]\r\n\r\nIt is a common idea that working a sewage farm for profit, and for\r\npurification of the sewage, are two incompatible things, whereas, the\r\ngood manager with sufficient working capital (double or more what\r\nwould be enough for the same acreage in ordinary agriculture) and a\r\ngood market for produce will attain the two together in due proportion\r\nin all ordinary seasons, when a fair allowance has been made him for\r\nthe necessary sanitary work.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to see how the popular idea of incompatibility has arisen\r\nin a case like that above stated of the Camp Farm tenant, eating up\r\nyear by year all the fertility stored up in the land during the\r\nprevious period, and letting nearly all the sewage run to waste,\r\nbecause its scientific application would cost much in thought and\r\nlabour. In much the same way district councils have been, all over the\r\ncountry, stinting their labour bills and interfering with their\r\nmanagers’ purchases and sales in order to make as small a demand on\r\nthe rates as they can—each year bringing some change of system—to the\r\nend that nobody is responsible or has any confidence in master or man.\r\n\r\nWith such a state of things up and down the country the way was\r\nprepared for preachers of microbe agency to say, why should you buy\r\nall that land when a septic tank, a few acres of coke or burnt\r\nballast, and a patent automatic opener and shutter of valves (which\r\nyou see working so nicely with tap water and model at some exhibition)\r\nwill give you “no more troublesome sludge,” and a first class effluent\r\nwith hardly any labour bill? if you only agitate against that\r\narbitrary Local Government Board, which insists upon land!\r\n\r\nBut those gentlemen neglected the fact, that in a few years’ time\r\ntheir filters would have to be pulled to pieces, washed and put back,\r\nwhile the land remains as efficient as ever, and a valuable asset, in\r\nsome cases saleable at building value, if it becomes desirable to move\r\nthe outfall further at some future time.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sludge treatment.]\r\n\r\nIn the above comparison between natural and artificial treatment\r\nreference has been had chiefly to the aerobic branch of the business,\r\nbut the anaerobic, breaking down _some_ of the solid organic matter\r\nand the sanitary disposal of the remainder in the state of sewage\r\nsludge (containing fully 90 per cent. of moisture) must not be\r\noverlooked or shirked as beneath the attention of the scientific\r\nbacteriologists and chemists whose analyses of effluents, and often of\r\nwhat they call crude sewage, are made from the liquid which has passed\r\nthrough a filter paper in their laboratory before their “oxygen\r\nabsorbed” or “ammonia processes” are proceeded with.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, I have always maintained that sludge, being the\r\nfoulest part of town sewage, ought to receive primary and earnest\r\nattention if we desire to improve the condition of our watercourses.\r\n\r\nWhen town sewage is pumped through a long rising main, it can often be\r\nspread on the land in its really crude state, and if the soil is clay\r\nploughed up to receive it the sludge is most beneficial to its\r\ntexture.\r\n\r\nBut in every other case we must face the nuisance of extracting the\r\nsludge, and its desiccation in one of the following ways.\r\n\r\n1. On a farm at some distance from roads and houses, the cheapest plan\r\nis to form a bank of earth about 18 inches high, enclosing a\r\nrectangular area into which the wet sludge can be run or pumped out of\r\ndepositing tanks, and left alone until dry enough for cartage, when it\r\ncan be used on the farm or sold to neighbouring farmers for a shilling\r\nor two a load.\r\n\r\n2. A wall of farmyard _long_ manure may be used instead of earth, and\r\ntrench 5 feet wide dug on each side of the longer sides of the\r\nrectangle, leaving 3 feet of ground between the wall and trench, on\r\nwhich men can stand to scoop the sludge over the wall when it has\r\nconsolidated a little in the trench; the latter is then ready to\r\nreceive the sludge from another tank emptying, which is again scooped\r\nover the wall on to a thin coating of farmyard manure, which has been\r\nscattered over the last layer of sludge in the rectangle; and thus in\r\na year’s time a solid mass of the mixture is raised four or five feet\r\nhigh, and is in capital order for putting in drills for a crop of\r\nmangold wurtzel.\r\n\r\nThis is the plan in use at the Camp Farm; it occupies little ground\r\nand smells only like rotten dung does during the few days carting to\r\nthe mangold field.\r\n\r\n3. Pressing by compressed air forcing a liquid mixture of sludge and\r\nlime into the interstices between cloths supported by vertical iron\r\nplates on a horizontal frame; and such pressing is a very expensive\r\nprocess, only resorted to when the sewage works are in a confined\r\npopulated district where no accumulation of sludge can be tolerated.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Expert examination of neighbourhood a very necessary\r\npreliminary to any sewage scheme.]\r\n\r\nBefore any sewage scheme is conceived a very careful survey of the\r\nneighbourhood ought to be made by a person who knows the requisites of\r\na site for sewage disposal, especially if land irrigation is intended,\r\nbecause natural advantages of site both for tanks, main carriers,\r\nroads, etc., may make all the difference in the world in expense and\r\nefficiency not only in first cost of works but also in their use\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\nAnd if land is to be acquired for sewage farming it will be very\r\ndesirable to include in the purchase some neighbouring high lying\r\narea, not required for sewage disposal but for growing straw crops to\r\nbe used on the farm.\r\n\r\n\r\nCROPPING A SEWAGE FARM.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Vegetation of some kind, useful or weeds, _will_ grow from\r\nsewage, and must be frequently removed from land or contact bed.]\r\n\r\nThis is a matter of vital importance, because when sewage is\r\n_intermittently_ applied to land of any kind or to coke beds,\r\nvegetation of some kind or other must result and must be removed in\r\norder to leave a clear course for the next dose of sewage; the cost of\r\nremoval and destruction of weeds will be found very great when contact\r\nbeds are tried on any working scale and would be quite prohibitive if\r\nallowed to grow on irrigated land.\r\n\r\nHence we must crowd out the weeds as much as possible by useful plants\r\nwhich will bring something towards the cost of their removal; and as\r\nthat return from perishable greenstuff is dependent upon its immediate\r\nsale or consumption on the farm, the manager must cast about for\r\ndemands for his abundant supply; but as both the sunshine (in this\r\nclimate) and markets are very capricious factors in the problem, he\r\nhas no easy task always to make both ends meet.\r\n\r\nTheoretically the town which yields the sewage ought to provide an\r\nabundant demand, but in practice it can rarely be depended upon,\r\nEdinburgh being the only exception, where the Craigentinny sewage\r\nmeadows are rented at a very high figure by the cow-keepers of a city\r\nsituated in the heart of an arable district.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Alternative destinations for vegetation thus removed. Milk\r\n(everywhere in demand) or a destructor furnace.]\r\n\r\nFortunately, however, there is always an unlimited demand for milk,\r\nand if he has the means of keeping a herd of cows on the farm, or can\r\narrange with a neighbouring cow-keeper to take all the grass and roots\r\nhe can supply at a low rate, it is about the best course a manager can\r\nadopt.\r\n\r\nIf he maintains a herd of cows, tied up in good, well ventilated\r\nstables, and has them daily brushed and groomed like horses, they\r\nrequire no exercise and produce milk in perfection for an average\r\nperiod of fifteen months from date of purchase after their third or\r\nfourth calving.\r\n\r\nSuch a herd will consume rye-grass carted from the field from April to\r\nNovember, and mangolds, kohl-rabi, and rye-grass hay during the\r\nwinter, thus securing a uniform demand for produce of the sewage land\r\nthroughout the year, and such cows will only require a little cotton\r\ncake and oat straw bedding (of which latter they eat a good deal) to\r\nfit them for sale to the butcher as soon as they become dry.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of such a steady demand is so great when rye-grass and\r\nmangolds, etc., are indicated as the main crops of the farm, owing to\r\nthe large volume of sewage per acre, that the system of cow-keeping is\r\nforced upon managers, however reluctant their sanitary authorities may\r\nbe to provide the necessary working capital, unless they can find a\r\nreliable contractor to receive at a fixed price any quantity of grass\r\nand roots the authority may grow and deliver.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Permanent pasture grazed and for hay available in certain\r\ncases.]\r\n\r\nWhen a town has more land in proportion to its sewage, permanent\r\npasture may take the place of Italian rye-grass, and, with proper\r\nprecautions, a part of the permanent pasture may be grazed; but the\r\nsaving of labour, thus supposed to result from letting animals bite\r\nand carry their food, is expended in making up, in a necessarily\r\nimperfect manner, the carriers trodden in by the cattle.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Importance of neat tidy contour carriers, correctly\r\nlevelled.]\r\n\r\nAnd here I would observe that most of the bad odour into which sewage\r\nfarming has fallen of late years is distinctly traceable to the common\r\nabsence of sufficient regularly contoured and neatly cut distribution\r\ncarriers resulting from parsimony about wages bills natural to the\r\nratepayers’ representatives in Council, and often to the manager’s\r\ndependence on a borough surveyor’s coming to the farm with his level\r\nand staff for great measures, or on his own guesses for smaller works,\r\ninstead of using an instrument to peg out every distribution carrier\r\nat the right moment.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Attract good labour.]\r\n\r\nThere is another important outlay of capital to be provided for in\r\nevery complete sewage scheme, which should embrace sufficient good\r\nlabourers’ houses and gardens in order to attract and retain on the\r\nspot the best class of workers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Summary of the experience of a lifetime.]\r\n\r\nTo sum up the general conclusions to which my experience points, and\r\nwhich I trust may prove useful to district councillors, they are as\r\nfollows:—\r\n\r\n     1. In works of sewerage, limit and regulate, as far as\r\n     possible, the volume of sewage by excluding subsoil\r\n     water and clean surface water.\r\n\r\n     2. Where the outfall sewage enters the disposal works\r\n     provide a pair of open catch-pits (or grit-chambers), each\r\n     twice as wide as, and 2 feet deeper than the sewer, with\r\n     sluices allowing the sewage to pass through one pit at a\r\n     time in its free course, while the other pit is being dried\r\n     and the deposited detritus dug out. The depth below sewer\r\n     invert may be more than 2 feet, and length of catch-pit is\r\n     immaterial, but I confine its width to twice that of the\r\n     sewer in order to conserve sufficient velocity in the\r\n     current to carry forward organic matter, paper, etc., and\r\n     leave only clean sand and gravel in these catch-pits.\r\n\r\n     Continuing the course by open channel (of same width as\r\n     outfall sewer), it should expand to five or six times its\r\n     width, forming the screening chamber, and thence discharge\r\n     into the\r\n\r\n     3. Depositing tanks. These are best formed in concrete with\r\n     smooth surface, with a semicircular level weir from which\r\n     the liquid overflows into a semicircular collecting open\r\n     carrier leading to the aerobic process on land or contact\r\n     bed.\r\n\r\n     The semicircles above referred to are struck from centre of\r\n     the inlet to depositing tank with a radius of 50 feet or\r\n     more.\r\n\r\n     The weir level should be at least 1 inch below that of\r\n     invert of inlet, and the depth of tank immediately under\r\n     this point should be governed by consideration of the\r\n     facility of drawing off the sludge by valve at that depth to\r\n     the sludge drying beds by gravitation if possible, or pump\r\n     if necessary, and from this sludge emptying valve the smooth\r\n     concrete bottom of tank slopes up to the semicircular weir\r\n     above described.\r\n\r\n     The bottom and sides of such a tank should be made with the\r\n     best Portland cement and finest granite chippings wrought to\r\n     a smooth surface, so that the sludge may be easily swept\r\n     clean away with a squeegee to its outlet valve, as it is\r\n     very necessary to have the tank thoroughly washed after each\r\n     emptying if my view of the _clean_ mode of sewage disposal\r\n     is to be carried out.\r\n\r\n     But with the dirty mode, on the contrary, some of the sludge\r\n     only should be drawn off and the septic anaerobic action\r\n     preserved continuously in the tank itself, whereas I prefer\r\n     that action to have its early and less offensive course in\r\n     the tank and its completion in a drying bed mixed if\r\n     possible with farm-yard manure.\r\n\r\n     4. The aerobic process. The one essential point in this\r\n     final process, whether in land or “contact beds,” is\r\n     _sufficient_ aeration (excess as by blowing has no result\r\n     commensurate with cost of its introduction), and it can be\r\n     attained by intermittence of sewage and rest, or by\r\n     continuous passage of sewage through a bed of coarse medium\r\n     _kept always just moist in all its atoms_ by a rain-like\r\n     dropping on the surface so carefully adjusted as to moisten\r\n     all parts and not to form a water-seal in any part of the\r\n     bed. Intermittence is easily arranged on any scale of\r\n     working, and continuous filtration, on the contrary, is\r\n     difficult even for a few thousand gallons a day.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Anticipation of a coming reaction against “fads” and\r\noverpressure in sanitation.]\r\n\r\nSince the above was written our grand old philosopher Herbert Spencer\r\nhas published a volume of “Facts and Comments”[3] containing a chapter\r\non “Sanitation in Theory and Practice,” which points to a coming\r\nreaction against the movement begun, some fifty years ago, by the late\r\nSir Edwin Chadwick and followed up by many enthusiastic exploiters of\r\nthe popular dread of “germs,” which he associated with bad smells.\r\n\r\nOf course the professor’s practical acquaintance with Chadwick’s hobby\r\nis, as he says, very limited, and his argument, that because sewage\r\nand manure smells are harmless in the open air of the country, they\r\nshould be equally innocuous in a town, falls to the ground when\r\nbrought to the test of experience, and I trust that Mr. Spencer will\r\nforgive me for pointing out that sewer-gas, drawn into a dwelling\r\nroom, in town or country, through scullery waste pipe or other\r\nconnection with a sewer in which the air is of lower temperature than\r\nthat of the dwelling room, is really prejudicial to health whether\r\naccompanied or not by disease germs.\r\n\r\nAnd although, as one of the experts to whom Chadwick appealed and\r\nwhose moderate testimony was cast aside because it did not come up to\r\nthe standard desired by his enthusiasm, I fully endorse Mr. Spencer’s\r\ncaution with regard to the mass of Blue Book evidence on sanitation, I\r\nventure to express my regret that the dear old man has had an\r\nunfortunate experience of sewage treatment, and my surprise that so\r\ndeep a reasoner should have published his judgment in this chapter\r\nwithout having taken the pains to extend his acquaintance with sewage\r\ntreatment in other places than the single instance of Burton-on-Trent.\r\n\r\nIn thus despising an unsavoury subject Mr. Spencer is not alone, and I\r\nam sorry to have to say that general indifference is answerable for\r\nthe waste of much public health and money, because it need not be\r\nsurprising if those following a _despised_ trade are sometimes ready\r\nto take advantage of the prejudice and ignorance of their employers.\r\n\r\nIn this sense I beg to quote Professor Spencer as follows in\r\njustification of the reflection with which I began the above essay:—\r\n\r\n     “New sanitary appliances are continually being devised,\r\n     sanctioned by authority, and required by surveyors; and\r\n     surveyors may have and certainly sometimes do have, personal\r\n     interests in pushing the use of them; either as being\r\n     shareholders in the companies they are manufactured by or as\r\n     receiving percentages on the numbers sold through their\r\n     recommendation.”\r\n\r\n\r\n     [2]: Published by Longmans, London, 1874.

INTRODUCTORY REMARKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the request of Lieut.-Colonel A. S. Jones, V.C., Assoc. M. Inst.\r\nC.E., who has done yeoman service in this matter, I have great\r\npleasure in putting down some observations on this old but ever\r\ncontroversial question of sewage treatment.\r\n\r\nColonel Jones has done more than anyone else living to establish\r\ncorrect views on sewage farming, and he has lately changed the\r\nGovernment sewage marshes at Aldershot into a veritable “Garden of\r\nEden,” watered by the waters from Aldershot Camp, growing healthy\r\ncrops, and causing not the slightest nuisance. After many struggles,\r\neven the milk from the dairy cows is now recognised as good and\r\nsupplied to the military hospitals. This is an achievement of which\r\nanyone might be proud; and all those who have been over the farm\r\nduring the time of the “deluge,” and can now study the order and\r\nsystem evolved out of chaos by Colonel Jones will testify to this! It\r\nis pleasant to record that the War Office have recognised Colonel\r\nJones’ work for them by having appointed him quite recently to manage\r\nall the sewage disposal works in the Aldershot district. This will\r\ninvolve the laying out of irrigation works in eight separate places,\r\nin some of which artificial methods of sewage purification have been\r\ntried and found wanting.\r\n\r\nBefore commencing with my task proper it may not be out of place to\r\ndescribe here very shortly the various stages through which the sewage\r\nquestion has passed during the century just closed. Such a retrospect\r\nis of general interest and may throw some further light upon our\r\nsubject; it must of necessity be short, otherwise it would absorb more\r\ntime and space than is at my disposal, and any shortcomings in this\r\nrespect that the reader may discover, I trust he will kindly put down\r\nto this cause.\r\n\r\n“The man in the street” seems year after year more called upon to form\r\nan important element in settling questions even of a scientific\r\nnature, and if what I am going to say should prove of some service to\r\nhim my labours will be well repaid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. THE SEWAGE QUESTION DURING THE LAST CENTURY.\r\n\r\nA SHORT RETROSPECT.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn dealing with the sewage question during the last century, it will\r\nbe an advantage to distinguish between the theory and practice of\r\nsewage purification, as such a division of the subject will render it\r\nless complicated and will tend to avoid misconceptions.\r\n\r\nDealing first with the theoretical side of the question, it is very\r\ndoubtful whether at the dawn of the century even a working hypothesis\r\nexisted to explain the process of sewage irrigation which was then\r\nadopted in one or two instances, notably at Edinburgh, where the town\r\nsewage was very successfully purified on the Craigentinny meadows. It\r\nis more than likely, that at this time instinct took the place of\r\ntheory, and that sewage irrigation was an instinctive imitation of\r\nirrigation with river water employed for many centuries in some\r\neastern countries.\r\n\r\nLater on it is on record, that Cagniard de la Tour in France, about\r\nthe year 1825, and Schwann in Germany, about the year 1836, expressed\r\nthe view, that organised substances—micro-organisms—played some role\r\nin fermentative and putrefactive changes. Almost diametrically opposed\r\nto this were the views authoritatively laid down by the then star in\r\nthe chemical horizon, Justus von Liebig, who, about the year 1845,\r\nmaintained that these changes were brought about by the dead inert\r\nmatter itself—by molecular movements in the same—and not by organised\r\nsubstances, the presence of which in fermenting or putrefying\r\nsubstances was purely accidental. So great was Liebig’s authority\r\nthen, that many almost blindly adopted his views, and the strife that\r\ncommenced around these opposing views was fought with the greatest\r\nbitterness. But the stronghold of old ideas, which were gradually but\r\nsurely being supplanted by new ones, could not hold out for ever\r\nagainst combined attacks, however stoutly it was defended by its\r\ndesigner, and its final downfall came about the year 1860, when a\r\nyoung Frenchman, Pasteur, established beyond doubt by his ever\r\nclassical researches, that fermentation and putrefaction were, in the\r\nfirst instance, due to living organisms and not to dead matter.\r\nPasteur further demonstrated that living organisms were also the cause\r\nof some and probably of all zymotic diseases.\r\n\r\nSo far, so good! But unfortunately the methods of biological research\r\nemployed by M. Pasteur were very cumbersome and left otherwise much to\r\nbe desired, so that his discoveries could not be fully utilised and\r\nextended, until in 1882 Robert Koch of Berlin published his new\r\nmethods of investigation. This was the signal of raising the\r\nfloodgates of biological (bacteriological) research throughout the\r\nworld with this result, that the flood waters pent up until then\r\ninundated practically other branches of scientific investigation and\r\ndrowned their individual life for some time to come.\r\n\r\nDuring this interval, 1860 to 1882, investigators who wished to study\r\nthe organised impurities in sewage had to proceed by indirect methods.\r\nThey had no means of ascertaining by direct biological experiment the\r\nnumber and character of the micro-organisms contained in sewage: all\r\nthey could do, was to determine chemically the dangerous nature of the\r\nsewage by the amount and origin of organic matter it contained, which\r\nwould probably act as food to the germs; and the greater this amount\r\nwas, so it was inferred, the greater would be the number of germs it\r\nharboured and the more dangerous its character.\r\n\r\nThis was the condition of things at the time the second Rivers\r\nPollution Commission carried out its investigations, which in many\r\nrespects, and rightly too, are still considered standard\r\ninvestigations. It cannot be surprising, therefore, that, being\r\nwithout proper means of biological examination, and having to rely\r\nchiefly on chemical methods only, the Commissioners came to the\r\nconclusion that the changes brought about in sewage purification were\r\ndue to mechanical and chemical agencies!\r\n\r\nIt is frequently a matter of the utmost difficulty to ascribe, after\r\nthe lapse of half-a-century, a new theory to one special author, as\r\nseveral investigators may have been trending the same way quite\r\nindependently of each other, but may not have been equally successful\r\nin the matter of their publications becoming generally known.\r\nTheories, as a rule, do not drop out of the clouds like meteorites,\r\nthey force themselves gradually upon men’s minds and are elaborated by\r\nthem until ripe.\r\n\r\nBearing this in mind, and subject to further research, it would appear\r\nas if Alexander Müller had been the first to apply Pasteur’s general\r\ntheories as to decomposition, fermentation and putrefaction to the\r\nproblem of the self-purification of sewage. He made his experiments in\r\n1869 and published them in 1873. Since that date a very large number\r\nof investigators have been at work on similar lines, and whilst it\r\nwould lead too far to deal with them minutely, it ought to be stated\r\nthat the results of their labour confirmed the view of living\r\norganisms playing a very important part in the decomposition of\r\nsewage. Among the many names prominent in this respect are those of\r\nSchloesing, Müntz, Hatton, Warrington, Sorby, Winogradsky, Percy\r\nFrankland, Dupré, Emich and Dibdin. That set of researches, however,\r\nwhich has done more than any other to consolidate the theory of\r\nbio-chemical changes taking place in the self-purification of sewage\r\nare the investigations of the Massachusetts State Board of Health,\r\nwhich were commenced in November 1887, and are still being continued.\r\n\r\nSince 1895 a large number of additional experiments have been made,\r\nwhich will be dealt with more in detail later on, but speaking\r\ngenerally they have not materially increased our knowledge of the\r\nprocesses taking place in sewage purification.\r\n\r\nSummarising the remarks on the theoretical aspect of this question,\r\nit may be said that, as to the agencies at work, we know now they are\r\nof a mechanical, chemical and biological nature; but as to the\r\nprocesses and products brought about by these agencies we know very\r\nlittle beyond the initial and terminal stages, as will be pointed out\r\nin some of the subsequent observations.\r\n\r\nDirecting now attention to the practical side of the question, it has\r\nalready been stated that the only known sewage treatment at the\r\ncommencement of last century was land irrigation. Then about the\r\nmiddle of the century chemistry seems to have taken the matter in hand\r\nand tried to make a lucrative business out of it. It is on record,\r\nhowever, that it did not succeed in this attempt, and the financial\r\nloss which this endeavour has caused is a dismal subject to\r\ninvestigate.\r\n\r\nThere is before my mind’s eye the case of a gallant officer of His\r\nMajesty’s land forces who, after having reached very near the summit\r\nof his career, retired and employed his time in trying to make a\r\nfortune out of sewage. So enamoured was he of the subject, that—so the\r\nstory goes—he commuted his pension to have all the more ready money;\r\nbut fortune did not smile on him, and his last days were spent under\r\nthe lengthening shadows of the sorrow of financial difficulties,\r\nhaving practically lost all he possessed.\r\n\r\nThe emphatic verdict of the first Sewage Commission of 1857, the first\r\nand second Rivers Pollution Commission, and, indeed, of all other\r\nauthoritative investigations, was in favour of land treatment; and it\r\ncannot, therefore, be surprising to find that the Local Government\r\nBoard insisted, save in exceptional cases, that “any scheme of sewage\r\ndisposal, for which money is to be borrowed with their sanction,\r\nshould provide for the application of the sewage or effluent to an\r\nadequate area of suitable land before it is discharged into a stream.”\r\nIndeed, had this body taken any different view and neglected the\r\nfindings of practically all authoritative inquiries, it would have\r\nbeen singularly deficient in the discharge of its duties to the\r\nratepayers of this country.\r\n\r\nBut the best of land cannot go on for ever doing its duty if by\r\nsystematic neglect and ignorance the essential conditions for\r\nsuccessful purification are year after year violated; and the great\r\npity is that the Local Government Board, after deciding in favour of\r\nland treatment, did not systematically superintend this operation. It\r\nmay not have had the power, but it is quite evident that had it done\r\nso, things would not have drifted from bad to worse, until local\r\nauthorities, driven to despair by the apparent failure of land and not\r\ndiscerning the right cause, refused altogether to be ruled by what\r\nseemed to them a very unfair and absurd restriction.\r\n\r\nIt was at this time that Mr. Dibdin, who, on behalf of the London\r\nCounty Council, had been carrying out a set of valuable experiments,\r\ncame forward with his application of well known theories to sewage\r\noperations on a large scale. As I pointed out at the time, Mr.\r\nDibdin’s experiments proved beyond a doubt that the application of\r\nsewage to suitable land was right in principle and that the failures\r\nwere brought about by the non-observance of the rules laid down by\r\nthis gentleman—that, in fact, sewage irrigation was the only natural\r\nmethod of sewage purification and that all the other methods were\r\nartificial. I described land treatment as the natural self-purification\r\nof sewage and the oxidation or contact bed system as the artificial\r\nself-purification of sewage.\r\n\r\nBut the swift current of public opinion had set very strongly against\r\nsewage farms, and nothing but the contact bed treatment would do. A\r\nlarge number of experimental plants on this system grew up like\r\nmushrooms all over the country, and the waves of enthusiasm seemed at\r\none time to engulf even the Local Government Board itself with its\r\n“antiquated notions,” until Parliament came to the rescue and\r\nappointed on May 7, 1898, a new Royal Commission to study the question\r\nof sewage purification.\r\n\r\nThis Commission consists of nine members,[4] i.e. six professional men\r\nand three laymen. Of the professional men, one is a biologist, one a\r\nchemist, two are medical men in administrative positions, and two are\r\nengineers likewise in administrative positions. Of the laymen two are\r\nmembers of special boards for the prevention of the pollution of\r\nrivers.\r\n\r\nSo far the Commissioners have issued an Interim Report dated July 12,\r\n1901, a volume of evidence and a volume of appendices. Quite lately,\r\nit is stated, they have issued a further Interim Report, to which are\r\nattached separate reports on some special subjects by their officers,\r\nbut this report has not yet come to hand.[5]\r\n\r\nAt the time of their first Interim Report, July 12, 1901, the\r\nCommissioners had held altogether thirty-five sittings, the first of\r\nwhich was on June 22, 1898, and the last on May 22, 1901. The period\r\nthus covered is nearly two years, and out of the thirty-five sittings\r\nthirty took place in London, and five in the provinces, viz. at Leeds,\r\nRipon, Manchester, Accrington and Reigate.\r\n\r\nOn these occasions, all in all, fifty-eight witnesses were examined,\r\nwho may be grouped as follows:\r\n\r\n   1 Zoologist\r\n   1 Botanist\r\n   2 Laymen\r\n   3 Bacteriologists\r\n   5 Lawyers\r\n   7 Medical men\r\n  11 Patentees\r\n  14 Chemists\r\n  14 Engineers\r\n\r\n  58 witnesses in all.\r\n\r\nOut of this number twenty-five were officials, viz. five lawyers, six\r\nmedical men, six chemists and eight engineers. Four officials were\r\nfurther managers of artificial sewage purification works, but not one\r\nsingle manager of natural purification works, i.e. a sewage farm\r\nmanager, was called, the term “sewage farm manager” being used here to\r\nindicate an official whose sole duty it is to manage a sewage farm.\r\n\r\nThe entire absence of this latter class of official is so striking\r\nthat it cannot be due to accident, but must be the outcome of a\r\nsettled policy not to reopen questions conclusively settled by\r\nprevious inquiries.\r\n\r\nAnother point that strikes the observer is that the Commission only\r\ncalled one zoologist and one botanist, as it is to these scientists\r\nthat belongs in the first instance the question of studying the fauna\r\nand flora of sewage before the subject is taken up by other branches\r\nof natural science.\r\n\r\nSpeaking on the whole, the evidence taken by the Commissioners forms\r\nvery interesting reading, and ought to be carefully studied by those\r\nwho have to deal with the subject. When now and again opinions are\r\nexpressed, which seem directly opposed to each other, it must be borne\r\nin mind that here, as in other things human, unanimity of opinion,\r\nthough much desired, is apparently unobtainable.\r\n\r\nTo understand the conclusions fully, at which the Commissioners in\r\ntheir Interim Report have arrived, it ought to be pointed out that\r\nthey had either to accept the recommendations in favour of land passed\r\nby all previous Royal Commissions and authoritative inquiries, or they\r\nhad to show by incontestable evidence that their predecessors had made\r\ngrievous mistakes, and where!\r\n\r\nOf these two courses, the present Commissioners have adopted, no doubt\r\nfor very good reasons of their own, the first, and they have started\r\ntherefore, in the conclusions to which they have come, at the point\r\nwhere previous inquiries had left off, viz. that land treatment is a\r\nvery proper method of sewage purification.\r\n\r\nBut before referring more in particular to their observations on land\r\ntreatment, it will be necessary to point out that the Commissioners\r\nevidently divide all methods of sewage purification into two main\r\nclasses, viz. natural and artificial methods. Into the former they\r\nonly place land treatment, whilst they call all other methods\r\nartificial.\r\n\r\nThis division seems to have given a great deal of offence to all those\r\nwho have expressed decided and frequently very one-sided views in\r\nfavour of the “bacterial” treatment of sewage; but on closer\r\nexamination it cannot be denied that the Commissioners were quite\r\nright in forming this view, as the following remarks will show.\r\n\r\nFor main divisions of all methods of sewage treatment two factors seem\r\nto be of primary importance, viz. the agencies which bring about this\r\npurification, and the way in which these agencies are employed. Now,\r\nit will not be denied that all agencies are natural ones, whether the\r\nprocess employed is a purely chemical one, a purely “bacterial” one,\r\nland treatment pure and simple, or a combination of these, and, at the\r\npresent time no such thing as an artificial agency is known; indeed,\r\nit is perhaps not too much to say that there cannot be such a thing\r\nas an artificial agency. Hence it is impossible to divide sewage\r\npurification methods in this respect by the agencies employed, and one\r\nis bound to fall back upon the way in which these agencies are\r\nemployed. Here it is no longer open to argument whether a chemical\r\nprocess or the contact bed system—oxidation bed system—is artificial,\r\nor whether the land treatment is natural! For who would deny that\r\nmasonry or concrete tanks and the materials contained in the same are\r\nartificial products—i.e. products formed by man—and that land is a\r\nnatural product—i.e. formed by nature—and that further the soil is the\r\nnatural home of bacteria. Hence it must be perfectly clear, even to a\r\ncasual observer, that the line of demarcation drawn by the\r\nCommissioners between all known systems of sewage purification is a\r\ncorrect and legitimate one, and that all objections to such a division\r\nare based on misconceptions.\r\n\r\nConcerning land treatment, the Commissioners observe, “We doubt if any\r\nland is entirely useless,” but further on they observe that peat and\r\nstiff clay lands are generally unsuitable for the purification of\r\nsewage. Concerning peat, nobody acquainted with the subject would\r\nprobably differ from their conclusions owing to the great amount of\r\nmoisture contained in this material; but as to clay soils, the\r\nCommissioners when making this statement must have known that there\r\nare several successful sewage farms on this kind of land in existence,\r\nsuch as the sewage farms at South Norwood, Wimbledon, Warwick and\r\nLeicester, not to mention others. In the case of Leicester, although\r\nthe land is a very dense boulder clay, the Corporation of this town\r\nhave just purchased the freehold of the farm for about 160,000_l._\r\n\r\nDealing with the artificial processes from a chemical point of view,\r\nthe Commissioners are of opinion that it is practicable to produce by\r\nthese processes alone, either from sewage or from certain mixtures of\r\nsewage and trade refuse, effluents which might be discharged without\r\nfear of creating a nuisance, and that in consequence the Local\r\nGovernment Board would be justified in modifying, under proper\r\nsafeguards, the present rule as regards the application of sewage to\r\nland.\r\n\r\nThe artificial processes referred to in the observations appear to be\r\nthe following:—\r\n\r\n  Closed septic tanks and contact beds.\r\n  Open septic tanks and contact beds.\r\n  Chemical treatment, subsidence[6] tanks and contact beds.\r\n  Subsidence tanks and contact beds.\r\n  Contact beds alone.\r\n  Closed septic tank followed by continuous filtration.\r\n  Open septic tank followed by continuous filtration.\r\n  Chemical treatment, subsidence tanks, and continuous filtration.\r\n  Subsidence tanks followed by continuous filtration.\r\n  Continuous filtration alone.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners do not say what these safeguards are, in fact they\r\nstate that no general rules concerning them can be laid down, and that\r\nin the case of these artificial processes it is necessary to consider\r\nevery case on its own merits.\r\n\r\nThe next point dealt with is the bacteriological quality of effluents,\r\nand here the Commissioners observe: “We find that, while in the case\r\nof effluents from land of a kind suitable for the purification of\r\nsewage there are fewer micro-organisms than in the effluents from most\r\nartificial processes, yet both classes of effluents usually contain\r\nlarge numbers of organisms, many of which appear to be of intestinal\r\nderivation, and some of which are of a kind liable under certain\r\ncircumstances at least to give rise to disease.”\r\n\r\nNo particulars of effluents from sewage farms are given, and later on\r\nit will be shown that this conclusion of the Commissioners is not in\r\naccord with the results published up to now and available concerning\r\nthe bacterial purity of effluents from land treatment.\r\n\r\nThe report concludes with some remarks on rivers pollution. The\r\nCommissioners state that it is of the utmost importance to provide the\r\nsimplest possible means for adequately protecting all rivers, and they\r\nthink that this subject is of such grave importance “as to demand the\r\ncreation of a separate Commission or a new department of the Local\r\nGovernment Board, which shall be a supreme Rivers Authority, dealing\r\nwith matters relating to rivers and their purification, and which,\r\nwhen appeal is made to them, shall have power to take action in cases\r\nwhere the local authorities have failed to do so.”\r\n\r\nSumming up the observations on the practice of sewage treatment, it\r\nmay be said that as a result of their extended inquiries, the present\r\nRoyal Commissioners have at the end of the century re-established land\r\nin its position as the first and only natural method of sewage\r\npurification, beside which they have recognised artificial\r\n(biological) treatments as being under proper safeguards admissible\r\nfor the purification of sewage.\r\n\r\nBefore concluding this portion of the observations, it is necessary to\r\nmention the valuable work done by Mr. Scott-Moncrieff and Mr. Cameron,\r\nwho, contemporaneous with Mr. Dibdin, but quite independently, had\r\nexperimented with sewage and evolved their own artificial methods of\r\nsewage treatment.\r\n\r\nThese remarks must suffice for the more historic portion of the\r\nsubject, viz. the progress of sewage purification during the last\r\ncentury, and it is time now to direct attention first to natural and\r\nafterwards to artificial sewage treatments.\r\n\r\n\r\n     [4] Two of these have since retired.\r\n\r\n     [5] This report has just been issued (August 18, 1902), and\r\n     although the special reports it contains are of the greatest\r\n     interest, it is not necessary to refer to it again in these\r\n     observations.\r\n\r\n     [6] The expression “subsidence tanks” is intended to denote\r\n     tanks which are used in such way that little or no septic\r\n     action is produced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. THE SUBSOIL.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: General remarks on subsoil and its properties.]\r\n\r\nBefore dealing more in detail with the processes taking place in the\r\npores of the subsoil of sewage farms, it may not be out of place to\r\nmake here a few general observations on the mechanical structure of\r\nsoil, its permeability, water capacity, retentive power, the capillary\r\nmovements in the same, its temperature, the subsoil air, the movement\r\nof water in and through the same, the micro-organic life in soil, and\r\nits absorbing powers.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. MECHANICAL STRUCTURE OF SOIL.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Size of grain and pores.]\r\n\r\nHere is of interest the size of the grains or particles composing the\r\nsoil, the size of the pores and their collective capacity.\r\n\r\nAccording to the character of the soil, its grains or particles will\r\nvary from very large in coarse gravel to very fine in fine sand and\r\nclay.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Variable size of pores.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Surface attraction.]\r\n\r\nThe size of the pores will vary as the size of its grains from large\r\nto small, but frequently a certain kind of soil will contain a mixture\r\nof large and small pores. The finer the pores the more energetic will,\r\nas a rule, be the surface attraction of the grains composing the soil.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Pore-volume.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: With particles of equal size pore-volume amounts to about\r\n38 per cent. of the total space, and sinks down to 10 or 15 per cent.\r\nwith particles of unequal size.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: With equally sized particles the pore-volume is the same\r\nwhether the particles are small or large.]\r\n\r\nThe collective capacity of the pores or the pore-volume mainly depends\r\non the equal or unequal sizes of the particles. When the same are of\r\nequal size the pore-volume amounts to about 38 per cent. of the total\r\nspace occupied by the soil, but when this is not the case it may sink\r\nto as low as from 10 to 15 per cent. of this space. With equally sized\r\nparticles the pore-volume is the same whether the individual particles\r\nare large or small. In nature it will be the exception to find all the\r\nparticles of equal size, such a condition of things prevails only when\r\ncareful sorting by sifting or riddling has taken place, and in the\r\nmajority of cases the larger pores will be partly filled up by the\r\nsmaller particles of the soil.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. PERMEABILITY OF SOIL.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Permeability depends first on the size of the pores, and\r\nsecondly on the pore-volume.]\r\n\r\nThe permeability of a soil for the passage of air and water depends,\r\nin the first instance, on the size of the pores, and is further to\r\nsome extent influenced by the pore-volume.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Effect of large and small pores.]\r\n\r\nSoil with large pores will offer but little resistance to the passage\r\nof air and water, but when the pores are small these movements will be\r\ngreatly impeded.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Permeability is proportional to the fourth power of the\r\npore-diameter.]\r\n\r\nIt has been ascertained that the permeability of soils is proportional\r\nto the fourth power of the diameter of the pores, so that it decreases\r\nvery rapidly with the diminishing size of the pores.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: In frozen soil permeability decreases rapidly.]\r\n\r\nIn subsoil with small pores all movements of air practically cease\r\nwhen it is half full of water, and in frozen soil the decrease of the\r\npermeability is still more marked.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. WATER CAPACITY OF SOIL.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Water capacity is equal to the pore-volume.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Air can never be wholly driven out of the pores.]\r\n\r\nThe water capacity of a soil is that quantity of water which can be\r\nstored in its pores; it is therefore equal to the pore-volume. For\r\nvery accurate measurements allowance must be made for a small amount\r\nof air, which even after filling remains in the pores and cannot be\r\ndislodged, but for practical purposes this can be overlooked.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1 cubic yard of soil with particles of equal size will hold\r\nabout 85 gallons of water.]\r\n\r\nAs has already been stated, the pore-volume of a soil consisting of\r\nequal particles throughout, amounts to about 38 per cent. of the space\r\noccupied by it, and 1 cubic yard of such a soil—whether we have to\r\ndeal with coarse gravel or fine sand—will hold about 85 gallons of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. WATER-RETENTIVE POWER OF SOIL.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The water-retentive power of soil is a percentage of its\r\nwater capacity.]\r\n\r\nThe water-retentive power of a soil is expressed by that quantity of\r\nwater which can be retained by it; it will always be a percentage or\r\nportion of the water capacity of this soil.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Soil with a large pore-volume and a large percentage of\r\nfine pores retains more water than soil with a small pore-volume and\r\nlarge pores.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Clean gravel retains about 10 gal. and clean sand about 70\r\ngal.]\r\n\r\nSoil with a large pore-volume and with a large percentage of fine\r\npores will retain more water than soil with a small pore-volume and\r\nfew fine pores. Clean gravel will retain about 12 per cent. of its\r\nwater capacity, i.e. 10 gallons per cubic yard, whereas fine sand may\r\nretain as much as 84 per cent. of its water capacity, i.e. about 70\r\ngallons per cubic yard.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Organically polluted soil retains more water than clean\r\nsoil.]\r\n\r\nThis will explain why a polluted subsoil containing a large amount of\r\norganic substances will retain more water than the same soil in a\r\nclean condition.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The retentive power of a soil is due to its surface\r\nattractions.]\r\n\r\nThe retentive power of a soil is due to the surface attraction of its\r\nparticles, and when the space between them is small, or when, in other\r\nwords, the pores are small, this attractive power will be all the\r\ngreater.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: When, after the limit of the retentive power has been\r\nreached, of water are poured upon the soil, a portion of the\r\npreviously stored water is driven out, and its place in the pores\r\ntaken up by the fresh supply.]\r\n\r\nIt is further of interest to observe here, that if after the limit of\r\nthe retentive power has been reached further quantities of water are\r\npoured upon the soil, the water retained in the lower layers will\r\ncommence to drain away. This means that the water freshly poured upon\r\nthe soil will drive out a portion of the water previously stored in\r\nthe pores. It is important to bear this in mind when dealing with\r\npolluted water, as owing to this action the water penetrating into\r\ndeeper layers will to some extent at least have become purified in the\r\nupper layers.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. CAPILLARY MOVEMENTS OF WATER IN SOIL.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Capillary attraction causes an upward movement of the\r\nwater.]\r\n\r\nThrough capillary attraction an ascending movement of the water is\r\ncaused in direct opposition to the laws of gravity, and the height to\r\nwhich water will thus ascend depends mainly on the smallness of the\r\npores; large pores do not assist in this movement. As the same,\r\nhowever, extends over the whole pore-volume the quantity of water thus\r\nraised may exceed the water-retentive power of soil.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Capillary attraction also causes lateral and downward\r\nmovements.]\r\n\r\nIn addition to the upward movement brought about by capillary\r\nattraction, this power is also continually at work in a lateral and\r\ndownward direction; but for the present purposes only the upward\r\nmovement will be noticed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Time occupied by upward movement. Height reached by upward\r\nmovement.]\r\n\r\nIn observing the upward movement, it is interesting to notice the time\r\noccupied by it and the total height reached. As to the time occupied,\r\nit has been established that the upward movement in gravel and coarse\r\nsand is much quicker than in fine and loamy sand, but the heights\r\nattained are reversed. For whereas the height in a material consisting\r\nof coarse or large pores amounts to from 2 inches to 4 inches; a\r\nheight of about 4 feet after thirty to thirty-five days has been\r\nrecorded in fine or loamy sand; in peaty soil one observer states that\r\nthe upward movement of the water may reach a height of 20 feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. TEMPERATURE OF SOIL.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Three principal sources of heat.]\r\n\r\nThe earth’s crust receives its supply of heat from three principal\r\nsources, viz.:\r\n\r\n1. From the sun through its rays;\r\n\r\n2. From the interior of the earth through conduction; and\r\n\r\n3. From various physical and chemical processes which take place in it\r\nand create heat.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Heat through sun’s rays.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dark soils absorb more heat than light-coloured soils.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Capacity for heat is greater in damp and fine-grained\r\nsoils.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Evaporation and condensation of aqueous vapour produce the\r\ngreatest effect in fine-grained soils.]\r\n\r\nDealing with the upper layers of the crust, it may be said that,\r\nbesides the intensity of the sun’s rays, the temperature also depends\r\non a variety of properties possessed by various kinds of soil, amongst\r\nwhich latter may be mentioned the absorption of heat, which is much\r\ngreater in dark than in light-coloured soils; the heat conductivity\r\nand the capacity for heat, which lead to higher temperatures in damp\r\nand fine-grained soils; and finally the evaporation and condensation\r\nof aqueous vapour, which tend to prevent extremes of heat and cold and\r\nwhich likewise produce the greatest effects in fine-grained soils.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A fine-grained damp soil does not get so hot, but retains\r\nthe heat better.]\r\n\r\nIt follows from these observations that a coarse-grained, dark\r\ncoloured and dry soil will show the highest and lowest temperatures,\r\nwhereas a fine-grained damp soil does not get so hot but retains the\r\nheat better.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The temperature of the surface of the soil may exceed that\r\nof the air.]\r\n\r\nIt ought to be pointed out in this place that a variety of\r\ncircumstances may bring about very high temperatures on the surface of\r\nthe ground which considerably exceed the average temperatures of the\r\nair at the same time.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Laws regulating the subsoil temperatures.]\r\n\r\nConcerning the laws that have been deduced from careful and long\r\ncontinued observations of subsoil temperatures, it will not be\r\nnecessary at this point to deal minutely with them; it must on the\r\ncontrary suffice to summarise only the more important ones.\r\n\r\nWith the distance from the surface of the ground,\r\n\r\n1. The differences of temperature become less,\r\n\r\n2. The temperatures are retarded, and\r\n\r\n3. The variations of short durations gradually disappear.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Subsoil temperatures 18 in. below surface.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Subsoil temperatures at depths of 4 ft. 6 in. and 9 ft.]\r\n\r\nAt a depth of 18 inches below the surface the daily fluctuations are\r\nhardly observable, the temperature differences of various days become\r\nobscured, the differences between the monthly mean temperatures are\r\nless by several degrees, and the yearly fluctuation amounts only to\r\nabout 10° C. At a depth of 4 feet 6 inches the latter is only 4° C.,\r\nand at a depth of 9 feet it is only 1°C.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Subsoil temperatures at depths from 9 ft. to 33 ft.]\r\n\r\nBetween 9 and 33 feet, according to the yearly mean of the surface,\r\nthe yearly fluctuation ceases and the temperature remains the same\r\nthroughout the year.\r\n\r\nBelow this point an increase of temperature is observable towards the\r\nearth’s centre, which amounts to about 1° C. for every 40 feet.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Retardation of temperatures with increase in depth.]\r\n\r\nConcerning the retardation of the temperatures with an increase in\r\ndepth below the surface, it is interesting to point out that this,\r\naccording to Fodor, amounts to about three weeks for every yard, so\r\nthat the yearly maximum at a depth of 1 yard will take place in\r\nAugust, at a depth of 2 yards in the beginning of September, and at a\r\ndepth of 4 yards in October. This is on the assumption that the\r\nmaximum temperature of the atmospheric air is reached in July.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Frost depth about 3 ft.]\r\n\r\nThe depth to which frost under ordinary conditions penetrates is about\r\n3 feet, but there are cases on record where water pipes at depths of\r\nfrom 4 to 5 feet have been frozen up during long continued severe\r\nfrost.\r\n\r\n\r\n7. SUBSOIL AIR.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Subsoil air is saturated with aqueous vapour and contains\r\nlarge quantities of carbonic acid.]\r\n\r\nThe pores of soil are either partly or wholly filled with air, which\r\nas a rule is saturated with aqueous vapour. This air consists very\r\nlargely of carbonic acid (from 0·2 to 14 per cent., on an average from\r\n2 to 3 per cent.) and to a small extent of oxygen, which has been used\r\nup for the formation of carbonic acid. It also contains traces of\r\nammonia and gases of decomposition.\r\n\r\nThe movements of subsoil air need not be considered here, and beyond\r\nthese few general observations it will not be necessary to deal with\r\nthe subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n8. MOVEMENTS OF WATER IN SOIL.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Strata above level of subsoil water.]\r\n\r\nTwo main strata may here be distinguished in subsoil, one above the\r\nlevel of the subsoil water and one below this level. The latter strata\r\ndo not interest us, and those above the level of the subsoil[7] water\r\nmay again be subdivided into three zones, which in descending order\r\nare as follows:—\r\n\r\n  The evaporation zone;\r\n  The passage zone; and\r\n  The capillary zone.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: One-third of the rain-water evaporates. One-third flows off\r\nthe surface. One-third percolates.]\r\n\r\nAll these three zones must be passed by the water in its descent from\r\nthe surface of the ground to the subsoil water level, and the quantity\r\nof water retained by them will depend on their state of dryness.\r\nSpeaking quite generally and within wide limits, one-third of the\r\nrain-water flows off the surface, one-third evaporates, and one-third\r\npercolates into the subsoil.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Evaporation zone.]\r\n\r\nThe evaporation zone reaches from the surface of the soil to that\r\npoint below, which marks the extent of the drying influence of the\r\natmospheric air. In the same the quantity of water stored in the pores\r\nmay at times sink below the retentive power of the soil, i.e. below\r\nthat quantity which can be retained in the pores owing to the\r\nmechanical powers of adhesion, etc. When it has become very dry\r\nthrough evaporation and other causes the zone, especially when it\r\nextends some way down, may retain large quantities of water. In a\r\ndepth of 10 inches, 1 square yard of soil, with fine pores, may retain\r\nabout 10 gallons of water, and as a rainfall of ½ inch produces only\r\n2·3 gallons per square yard, it is clear that subsoil of this nature\r\nmay retain a number of successive showers. During the height of summer\r\nfine porous soil may become so dry that practically no water finds its\r\nway into deeper zones; in this state the evaporation zone can be\r\ncompared to a large sponge.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Passage zone.]\r\n\r\nThe next zone traversed by the water in its downward movement is the\r\npassage zone, which lies beyond the drying influence of atmospheric\r\nair. When too far removed from the level of the subsoil water, its\r\npores will not be completely filled with water, but will only contain\r\nthat amount which is due to the retentive powers of the soil. By\r\ndirect measurement it has been found that on an average a cubic yard\r\nof fine porous soil will retain from 30 to 80 gallons of water, and it\r\ncan easily be calculated that in a layer from 1 to 2 yards in\r\nthickness the rainfall of a whole year may be retained. The passage\r\nzone, especially if it is of considerable thickness, represents a very\r\nlarge storage reservoir.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Capillary zone.]\r\n\r\nThe last zone before the level of the subsoil water is reached is the\r\ncapillary zone, in which the pores are partially or wholly filled by\r\nthe upward movement—due to capillary attraction—from the subsoil\r\nwater. The extent of this filling will depend on the size of the pores.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Springs.]\r\n\r\nWhen the descending water has finally reached the subsoil water it\r\neither comes to a standstill altogether on the impervious layer or\r\nmoves along the same, if the latter is not horizontal, until it may\r\neventually leave the subsoil again by issuing therefrom in the form of\r\nvisible or invisible springs.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rate of downward movement governed by pores.]\r\n\r\nThe rate of movement of any liquid—rain-water, sewage or other\r\npolluting liquid—is largely governed by the size of the pores. Where\r\nthese are large, as for instance in coarse gravel, the descent of the\r\nwater will be comparatively rapid, but when they are small it may take\r\na very long time before the water reaches the level of the subsoil\r\nwater, and in that case it will have undergone material changes as\r\nregards its chemical or bacterial composition.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: With a high level of subsoil water zones become\r\nindistinguishable.]\r\n\r\nWith a high level of subsoil water the zones may become\r\nindistinguishable, one zone reaching into the other, with the result\r\nthat the whole of the soil becomes very wet.\r\n\r\nWhen subsoil has been artificially drained the amount of water\r\nreaching the subsoil water below the general level of the drains will\r\ndepend on the size of the latter and the distance between them. In\r\nsuch a case the downward movement of the water through undrained soil,\r\npreviously described, may be further interfered with through the\r\nventilation of the subsoil by drains, and the drying up action caused\r\nthereby.\r\n\r\n\r\n     [7] The term subsoil water is here used to denote that\r\n     portion of the water in the pores of the soil, which is\r\n     either at rest on or moves along the inclined plane of an\r\n     impervious layer.\r\n\r\n\r\n9. THE MICRO-ORGANIC LIFE IN SOIL.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Soil probably original home of micro-organisms.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Distribution of micro-organisms in soil.]\r\n\r\nThe soil is probably the original home of all micro-organisms, from\r\nwhich they have emigrated into other media. It contains vast numbers,\r\nand, according to some observers, 1 ccm. may hold 100,000 germs. By\r\nfar the greater number is found on or near the surface, and in lower\r\nlayers the numbers gradually diminish, until at last a depth is\r\nreached, which depends on local conditions, where the soil is\r\nperfectly sterile. The aerobes live near the surface and carry on\r\ntheir work in this region, whereas the anaerobes are at work lower\r\ndown in the soil.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cycle of micro-organic activity during the year.]\r\n\r\nThe picture of the cycle of micro-organic activity in the upper layers\r\nof the soil during the various seasons of the year is probably the\r\nfollowing. In winter, especially during that period when frost and ice\r\nbind the earth, micro-organic life is apparently at its lowest ebb,\r\nand may in some very cold climates come to a standstill altogether,\r\nwhen micro-organisms may be said to hold their vegetative winter\r\nsleep. With the return of life and the awakening of nature in\r\nspring—especially with the approach of higher temperatures and the\r\nformation of moisture—micro-organic activity once more makes itself\r\nfelt all round. During the summer months it is exposed to some\r\ninjurious influences such as the heating and drying up of the upper\r\nlayers of the soil, but, still gradually increasing, micro-organisms\r\nreach the climax of their activity during the autumnal rains, to\r\nremain in this state until with the advent of the cold season their\r\nactivity gradually declines again.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Micro-organic life in layers from 3 ft. to 6 ft. in depth.]\r\n\r\nIn the lower layers of the soil, down to 3 feet and 6 feet,\r\nmicro-organisms are more protected against the injurious influences of\r\nthe atmosphere, sunlight and drying up, but the want of oxygen,\r\ntogether with the greater difficulty of removing such products as\r\ncarbonic acid, has an injurious influence. As the temperature in these\r\nlayers is considerably more uniform, it may be inferred that the\r\nmicro-organic activity is there of a more uniform kind, less\r\ninfluenced by sudden changes, probably also less intense, but without\r\npronounced periods of rest.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Micro-organisms probably quickly perish in depths greater\r\nthan 6 ft.]\r\n\r\nIn depths greater than 6 feet micro-organisms probably perish very\r\nquickly owing to unfavourable conditions, and if found their presence\r\nmust be explained by emigration from higher layers, not by actual\r\ngrowth at these depths.\r\n\r\nOn sewage farms the micro-organic activity is without doubt greatly\r\nmodified, and proceeds all the year round at a more uniform rate than\r\non ordinary land, as the sewage always contains the necessary warmth\r\nand moisture so beneficial for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n10. THE ABSORBING POWERS OF SOIL.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Absorbing powers due to surface attraction of the particles\r\nof the soil.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The finer the pores the greater the absorption.]\r\n\r\nThe absorbing powers of soil are due to the surface attraction of its\r\nparticles or grains, and these, as has already been pointed out, will\r\nbe all the greater the finer the pores are; they extend on the one\r\nhand to aqueous and other vapours and gases, and on the other to\r\nmatters in solution.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1 cub. yd. of coarse gravel may contain 50 sq. yds. of\r\nsurface and 1 cub. yd. of fine sand 9200 sq. yds.]\r\n\r\nThat the attractive force of the surface of the particles is pretty\r\nconsiderable will be at once apparent when it is stated that 1 cubic\r\nyard of coarse gravel may contain about 140,000 grains with a combined\r\nsurface of 50 square yards, and 1 cubic yard of fine sand 40 million\r\ngrains with a combined surface of 9200 square yards, which is a little\r\nunder 2 acres.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Deodorising action of soil absorption of gases.]\r\n\r\nConcerning the absorption by soil of aqueous vapour and gases (apart\r\nfrom condensation through a fall in temperature), dry soil with fine\r\npores acts most energetically. The almost instantaneous deodorisation\r\nof foul-smelling gases, such as are formed by decomposing fæcal\r\nmatters (earth closet) or coal gas, through a thin layer of fine dry\r\nsoil is well known, and is to be explained in this way.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Absorption of dissolved substances by soil.]\r\n\r\nMore interesting still, and also more important, is the absorption of\r\ndissolved substances by soil. In this way is to be explained the\r\ndecolorising effect and the retention of dissolved polluting\r\nsubstances such as are contained in sewage. In the same way soil has\r\nthe power of destroying such poisons as strychnine, nicotine, coniine,\r\netc., and the experiments of Falk and others go to show that ptomaines\r\nand toxines are likewise retained and rendered harmless by it. This\r\nabsorbing power of soil is of the utmost importance in agriculture,\r\nand without it soil could not possess purifying powers for polluting\r\nliquids. It is quite true that in this process of purification other\r\nfactors play an important part, but they could not come into play if\r\nthis absorption did not exist.\r\n\r\nThe absorbing powers of soil are in some way dependent on the presence\r\nof micro-organisms and air, and in the absence of these they will soon\r\ncome to a standstill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. SELF-PURIFYING POWERS OF SOIL. NATURAL SELF-PURIFICATION OF\r\nSEWAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Self-purifying powers of soil.]\r\n\r\nAfter these preliminary remarks it becomes necessary now to examine\r\ninto the self-purifying powers of soil with special reference to\r\nsewage farms. Generally speaking, the term “self-purifying powers\r\npowers of soil” comprises all those processes which go on on the\r\nsurface and in the pores of the soil of sewage farms, and by which\r\npolluting liquids such as sewage become purified as these take place\r\nunder natural conditions and in a natural medium, the process of land\r\ntreatment of sewage is called—see previous observations—“the natural\r\nself-purification of sewage.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Self-purifying powers vary with local conditions.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Soil best suited for sewage farms.]\r\n\r\nIt should be stated at the outset that the self-purifying powers of\r\nsoil will depend largely on the soil itself and the local conditions\r\nunder which they come into play, so that observations made in one\r\nlocality will not be immediately applicable to others without making\r\nfull allowance for the differences; this will be clear from the\r\npreliminary remarks as to the character and properties of soils made\r\nin the previous pages. As will be pointed out more in detail later on,\r\na subsoil that combines great permeability for air with high retaining\r\nand absorbing powers, is best suited for sewage farms.\r\n\r\nLet us now consider what becomes of water, sewage or any other\r\npolluting liquid containing organic substances after it has been\r\npoured out upon the surface of the ground, and for this purpose we\r\nwill assume a subsoil of a suitable character and in fair condition\r\nfor work with proper under-drainage.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Retention of liquid by pores of soil.]\r\n\r\nThe liquid thus poured out upon the surface will sooner or later\r\ndisappear in the soil, and will at first be retained in the pores of\r\nthe zone of evaporation, which may be said to extend to the level of\r\nthe under-drains. This retention is due to the retentive powers of\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Suspended matters retained on the surface, soil acts like a\r\nsieve.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Coating of surface of the land.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Removal of suspended matters generally an advantage.]\r\n\r\nPortion of the suspended matters will be retained on the surface and\r\nthe rest will be strained out in a mechanical manner in the pores, the\r\nsoil acting as a sieve more or less fine according to its character. If\r\nthe suspended matters are present in very large quantities it may\r\nhappen that they will gradually form a coat on the surface of the land\r\nand choke the pores to the exclusion of air, and as this is a thing to\r\nbe avoided in sewage farming it is in most cases advisable to remove\r\nthem out of the liquid before it is poured upon the land.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The more finely divided the suspended matters are, the\r\nlighter the work of the land.]\r\n\r\nEven where such a removal has taken place there will still be left a\r\ncertain portion of the suspended matters, and if these are in a finely\r\ndivided state, such as is probably the result of their passage through\r\nfine strainers or pump valves, the work of the land will be\r\nconsiderably lightened.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Micro-organisms screened out in a mechanical way.]\r\n\r\nThe micro-organisms contained in the liquid will be to a large extent\r\nscreened out in a mechanical way with the suspended matters and\r\ndeposited on the surface and in the upper layers of the soil.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Retention of matters in solution after removal out of the\r\nliquid is due to physical and chemical agencies.]\r\n\r\nThe matters in solution will partly, after removal out of the liquid,\r\nbe retained by the absorbing powers of the soil in the pores, a\r\nprocess that is due to physical and chemical agencies.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Absorbing powers gradually ripen.]\r\n\r\nIt is well known that land which is being treated with sewage for the\r\nfirst time does not purify sewage so well as land that has been under\r\nsystematic treatment for some time, and this is probably due to the\r\nabsorbing powers, which gradually ripen until they have reached their\r\nmaximum of efficiency. This process of gradual improvement seems to be\r\ndue to the formation of a slimy coating round each particle of soil,\r\nwhich growth does not only assist mechanical filtration, but also\r\npossesses high powers of absorbing oxygen.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Depths to which polluting substances may penetrate into\r\nsoil.]\r\n\r\nThe depth to which polluting substances may penetrate into soil will\r\nprobably differ in each case, but the following factors may be said to\r\ninfluence it, viz. the velocity of the downward flow, the nature and\r\ndegree of the polluting liquid, and the character of the soil. Where,\r\ntherefore, the powers of the soil are over-taxed the polluting\r\nsubstances may reach the level of the underdrains and pass out through\r\nthem, in which case the effluent will be but little better than the\r\nraw liquid. It must be the aim of careful management to avoid this.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Process of decomposition of organic matters stored in soil\r\nduring periods of rest.]\r\n\r\nThe polluting substances of an organic nature thus stored in the pores\r\nundergo here—and that probably chiefly during periods of rest—a\r\nprocess of decomposition or disintegration, which goes on until the\r\nwhole of the organic matter has been converted into stable mineral\r\nforms.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Explanation of the term “self-purifying power of soil.”]\r\n\r\nThis process of retention, absorption and decomposition of organic\r\nimpurities is called “the self-purifying power of soil.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: After conversion substances are removed out of the soil by\r\nthe plants, by the subsoil air and subsoil water.]\r\n\r\nThe substances thus converted do not remain in the pores, but they are\r\nremoved either by the plants, for which they act as food, or by the\r\ncurrents of subsoil air, or by the subsoil water, and as the removal\r\nof fertilising substances by the subsoil water indicates a waste it\r\nmust be the aim of a careful management to utilise them as much as\r\never possible for the benefit of the plants.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Process of digestion. “Sewage sick.”]\r\n\r\nThe whole of these intricate and very complicated changes may be\r\nlikened to the process of digestion in animals, and when these\r\ndigestive powers are overtaxed signs of sickness may be noticed as the\r\ninevitable result, which increase until, in sewage phraseology, the\r\nland becomes “sewage sick.” In this condition it remains until the\r\nflow of the polluting liquid is stopped, when after a period of\r\nrest—recreative period—the digestive powers gradually return and begin\r\nto do their work afresh.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Action of lime.]\r\n\r\nWhen the soil of a sewage farm has got into this state, owing to\r\nhaving received heavy doses of sewage, the application of lime has\r\nproved very beneficial by accelerating the process of nitrification,\r\nand in this respect interesting experiments have been made on the\r\nBerlin sewage farms. The action of lime is said to be a twofold one.\r\n\r\n1. It quickly attacks and splits up the organic matters and\r\naccelerates afterwards their decomposition and their utilisation by\r\nplants; and\r\n\r\n2. It neutralises the excess of acid in the soil, and causes the\r\nlatter to part with its carbonic acid.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Decomposition proceeds quickest at or near the surface.]\r\n\r\nThe process of decomposition proceeds as a rule at a much quicker rate\r\non the surface and in the upper layers of the soil, where, as already\r\nmentioned, the number of micro-organisms is greatest.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: When carefully worked there is no time limit to the\r\npurifying powers of the soil.]\r\n\r\nIt has been maintained that the soil of sewage farms will after a\r\nwhile silt up and cease to purify sewage, but the results obtained\r\nwith carefully managed farms clearly disprove this, and under these\r\nconditions there appears to be no limit as to time to the purifying\r\npower of soil.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Depth of soil necessary for purification.]\r\n\r\nConcerning the depth of soil—evaporation zone—that is necessary for\r\nthe successful retention, absorption and decomposition of sewage, no\r\ngenerally applicable rule can be laid down, as this will depend on a\r\nvariety of factors, amongst which may be mentioned: the character and\r\nthickness of the top soil (humus), the nature and cultivation of the\r\ntop soil; the character of the subsoil—its permeability for air and\r\nits retaining and absorbing powers; the surface slopes of the land and\r\nthe level of the subsoil water.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Greater depths than 4 ft. will be rarely necessary.]\r\n\r\nOn some farms a depth of 3 feet on an average has proved sufficient,\r\nand on others the drains have been laid at depths ranging between 3\r\nand 6 feet, but very special reasons ought to be shown for all depths\r\nover 4 feet.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Soil best suited for sewage farms.]\r\n\r\nWhilst practically no soil is entirely useless for sewage farming,\r\nwith the exception perhaps of peat, owing to the quantity of moisture\r\nit contains, a soil that combines great permeability for air with high\r\nretaining and absorbing powers—such as a loamy sand with fairly large\r\ngrains—is probably the best.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Clay soil not unsuitable for sewage farms, but it\r\nnecessitates a greater area of land.]\r\n\r\nIt has been maintained that clay, owing to its impervious character,\r\nis totally unsuitable for sewage farming, but the experience of such\r\nfarms as South Norwood, Wimbledon, Warwick and Leicester disproves\r\nthis. It is true, however, that as the purifying powers of the soil\r\nare restricted in a vertical sense to the upper layers, it may become\r\nnecessary in places to extend the area of the farm beyond what would\r\nbe necessary with a more pervious soil.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Changes observed in the heavy clay land at Leicester since\r\nsewage treatment was commenced.]\r\n\r\nIt may not be without interest to draw attention here to some of the\r\nchanges that have taken place on the Leicester sewage farm since the\r\nland has received regular dressings of sewage. When I was engaged in\r\nlaying it out in 1888 my powers of locomotion over the land were\r\ngreatly impeded during wet seasons by the inordinate amount of clay\r\nthat adhered to the boots; but when engaged again for some\r\nconsiderable time on the land during the winter 1900 to 1901 this\r\nunpleasant peculiarity had completely disappeared even on land that\r\nhad recently been sewaged. Through the action of the sewage the very\r\ndense clay had been disintegrated and become so pliable that, when\r\ntrod upon, it crumbled to pieces. The colour of the soil had been\r\nchanged from a yellowish-brown to a greyish-black, and altogether the\r\nland had been greatly improved by the application of the sewage.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Movement of liquid through the passage and capillary zones\r\nto the impervious layer.]\r\n\r\nIf more sewage is poured upon the land than the effluent drains can\r\ndeal with—and here it may be well to bear in mind that on sewage farms\r\nin our climate on a broad average throughout the year about one-third\r\nof the total quantity is lost by evaporation—the excess will pass down\r\nbetween the drains from the evaporation to the passage zone, and if\r\nthe flow of the sewage is not discontinued the downward movement in\r\nthe passage zone may be continued until, after having traversed the\r\ncapillary zone, the level of the subsoil water is reached.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Length of downward movement of water may be very great.]\r\n\r\nWhat length of time may elapse before this level is reached will\r\nentirely depend on local circumstances, but it will be clear from the\r\npreliminary remarks that the completion of this downward movement may\r\nin places and under certain conditions take a very long time.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Displacement of sewage held by the pores of the land by the\r\nfresh discharge of sewage upon the surface of the land.]\r\n\r\nIn connection with this it is of importance to point out that not the\r\nfresh sewage which is poured on the surface of the land will at once\r\npass into the lower layers, but a portion of the old sewage, which up\r\nto then was stored in the pores and is now displaced by the fresh\r\ndischarge, so that the fresh raw sewage is retained and only purified\r\nsewage allowed to escape into deeper layers, which means that in its\r\ndownward movement all sewage undergoes purification. Were this not the\r\ncase the raw sewage might reach the effluent drains.\r\n\r\nIt appears time now to examine somewhat more closely the processes of\r\ndecomposition and the products elaborated therein.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Factors that influence the process of decomposition.]\r\n\r\nConcerning the factors which have a favourable influence upon this\r\nprocess, some of them, such as permeability for air, high retentive\r\nand absorbing powers, have already been mentioned, and to these can be\r\nadded moisture and warmth, the latter of which are always present in\r\nsewage.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Advantages of a systematic underdrainage.]\r\n\r\nOne word here concerning the systematic under-drainage of the subsoil.\r\nIts chief function is, of course, the carrying away of the effluent\r\nwater and by doing so to prevent the formation of a swamp, but after\r\nthe land has done its work, and during so-called periods of rest, the\r\nunder-drains act as ventilators of the subsoil and thus make it\r\nartificially more permeable for air, with the result that a drying-up\r\naction is set up and oxygen supplied for micro-organic life. For the\r\npurpose of improving the ventilation of the soil it may become\r\nadvisable in places to connect the upper ends of the drains with a\r\nshort upcast shaft. The mouths of the drains should always discharge\r\nabove water so as to allow of a free circulation of air.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Micro-organisms that carry on the work of splitting up and\r\nconverting organic compounds.]\r\n\r\nThe work of splitting up and converting the organic compounds is\r\nprimarily carried out by micro-organisms such as yeast fungi, mould\r\nfungi, algæ, protozoa and even by higher forms of life such as\r\nearthworms and insects.\r\n\r\nTo what extent in addition to these other agencies take part in this\r\nbio-chemical process is not yet fully elucidated.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Decomposition and putrefaction most complicated processes.]\r\n\r\nFischer in his interesting book, ‘The Structure and Functions of\r\nBacteria,’ observes (page 99): “The decomposition of dead animal\r\nbodies, of vegetable tissues, or of substances like stable manure, is\r\nfar from being a simple putrefactive process. Side by side with the\r\ndisintegration of nitrogenous bodies there are going on a number of\r\nfermentative changes by which non-nitrogenous compounds are being\r\nbroken up, besides nitrification and other bio-chemical processes. For\r\nthis reason it is always difficult and often impossible to determine\r\nthe respective parts played by the different species of bacteria.…\r\n\r\n“The phenomena of putrefaction are so complicated that we do not know\r\nall of the compounds that arise during the process.… Very careful\r\nchemical investigations on pure cultures will be necessary before the\r\nchaos of phenomena presented by putrefactive bacteria can be arranged\r\nin something like order.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: In the decomposition of proteids five or rather six stages\r\nmay be distinguished.]\r\n\r\n“Proteids are split up by putrefaction into a large number of simpler\r\ncompounds both nitrogenous and non-nitrogenous. The substances thus\r\nproduced are precisely similar to those resulting from the artificial\r\ndecomposition of proteids by fusion with caustic potash or boiling\r\nwith hydrochloric acid or barium hydrate. Five groups may be\r\ndistinguished:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Albumoses and peptones.]\r\n\r\n“1. Albumoses and peptones: soluble diffusible bodies closely\r\nresembling albumen. They are produced by the action on albumen of\r\nbacterial enzymes, similar to the enzymes (pepsin and pancreatin)\r\nwhich give rise to peptones in the digestive tract of man.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Aromatic compounds.]\r\n\r\n“2. Aromatic compounds; among others indol and skatol, which give the\r\ncharacteristic odour to human excrement; also some non-nitrogenous\r\nsubstances such as phenol, phenylacetic acid, and phenylpropionic\r\nacid.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Amido compounds.]\r\n\r\n“3. Amido compounds, all nitrogenous: leucin, tyrosin, aspartic acid,\r\nglycocol.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fatty and aromatic acids.]\r\n\r\n“4. Fatty and aromatic acids, all non-nitrogenous and therefore having\r\nno part in the circulation of nitrogen; acetic, butyric, succinic and\r\nvalerianic acids.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Inorganic end-products of putrefaction.]\r\n\r\n“5. Inorganic end-products of putrefaction: free nitrogen, ammonia,\r\nfree hydrogen, methane, carbonic acid, methylmercaptan, sulphuretted\r\nhydrogen. It is probable also, but not certain, that phosphuretted\r\nhydrogen is formed and is oxidised at once by the free oxygen of the\r\natmosphere.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ptomaines.]\r\n\r\n“Most of these substances are formed also by the chemical decomposition\r\nof proteids, but there is a sixth group which may be termed specific\r\nputrefactive products. These are the so-called ptomaines or\r\nputrefactive alkaloids.”\r\n\r\nSome of these bodies are either not poisonous or only poisonous in\r\nlarge doses, whilst others, derived from putrid foods of various kinds\r\n(sausages, cheese), are highly toxic (ptomatropine, tyrotoxine).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Definition of some terms.]\r\n\r\nConcerning the work done by micro-organisms, it may not be out of\r\nplace here to define the meaning of certain terms, and to direct\r\nattention at the same time to the modifications in the results brought\r\nabout by the presence or absence of air during the various stages of\r\nthe process.\r\n\r\nThe terms mineralisation, disintegration, oxidation, hydrolysis,\r\nbacteriolysis, nitrification, decomposition, eremacausis,\r\nputrefaction, fermentation, etc., have by many been used somewhat\r\npromiscuously, and this has led to a good deal of confusion,\r\nbewilderment and misconception. The cause of this has been undoubtedly\r\nour small amount of knowledge concerning this process and the changes\r\nbrought about therein, but this would appear to be no reason why\r\ncomplication should be made worse. For the purposes of these remarks\r\nthe undermentioned terms shall have the following meaning.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mineralisation.]\r\n\r\nThe term “mineralisation” is used for describing the whole process of\r\nthe disintegration and conversion of organic into mineral matter, and\r\nno distinction shall be made between organic matter containing\r\nnitrogenous and organic matter containing carbonaceous substances.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Aerobic fermentation or decomposition.]\r\n\r\nWhen this process of mineralisation is carried on in the presence of\r\nsufficient quantities of air it is called “aerobic fermentation,” or\r\n“decomposition,” which is generally characterised by the absence of\r\nstrong smells. The process may then be called one of complete\r\noxidation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Anaerobic fermentation or putrefaction.]\r\n\r\nWhere, however, the mineralisation proceeds in the absence of air the\r\nprocess is called “anaerobic fermentation,” or “putrefaction,” and it\r\nis then that very pronounced foul smells are emitted. The process may\r\nthen be called one of incomplete oxidation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Obligatory aerobes and anaerobes.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Facultative anaerobes.]\r\n\r\nThat class of micro-organisms which can only live in the presence of\r\noxygen is called “obligatory aerobes,” and that which can only exist\r\nin the absence of this gas “obligatory anaerobes.” Between these two\r\nis the group of “facultative anaerobes,” which, while growing best\r\nwith a plentiful supply of oxygen, are nevertheless able to exist with\r\na very small amount, and even with none at all, although in this case\r\ntheir vitality is often much impaired.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Organic matters are first split up and then converted into\r\nmineral substances.]\r\n\r\nIn the process of mineralisation two stages may be distinguished, viz.\r\nthe first or disintegration stage, and the second or oxidation stage,\r\ni.e. the organic substances are first split up and afterwards\r\nconverted into inorganic ones; and frequently these processes are\r\ntaking place side by side and not after each other.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The splitting up of organic substances is frequently\r\ncarried out in the presence of air.]\r\n\r\nIt has been maintained—probably with a view to justifying the\r\nnecessity of a septic tank—that the preliminary process of splitting\r\nup is best carried out in the absence of oxygen, but sufficient proof\r\ndoes not appear to have been advanced in support of this statement,\r\nand in some cases at any rate it is evidently carried out quite\r\nsatisfactorily in the presence of air.\r\n\r\nConcerning the presence or absence of oxygen, Fischer observes as\r\nfollows:—\r\n\r\n     “The effects of the presence of oxygen are somewhat better\r\n     understood. If air have free access, putrefaction\r\n     (decomposition) may go on without any odour at all, the\r\n     evil-smelling gases (NH{3} and SH{2}, for example)\r\n     being oxidised at once to form nitrates and sulphates.\r\n     Aerobic bacteria, too, such as the nitre and sulphur\r\n     bacteria, bring about this mineralisation of organic\r\n     nitrogen. Moreover, when air is circulating freely, there is\r\n     no accumulation of intermediate products such as skatol or\r\n     indol. It occurs on the surface of manure heaps, on the\r\n     outer surfaces of carcases, and in well ventilated soil.\r\n\r\n     “In anaerobic decomposition (putrefaction proper), as in\r\n     anaerobic fermentation, the organic molecules are at first\r\n     only partly disintegrated, intermediate products such as\r\n     leucine, tyrosine, skatol and indol being formed. In the\r\n     absence of air these accumulate, and hence it is that\r\n     putrefaction going on in the mud of ponds and ditches, or\r\n     inside carcases, is accompanied by such evil odours.\r\n\r\n     “Although the details of the process vary considerably,\r\n     according to the presence or absence of air, the ultimate\r\n     products of decomposition and putrefaction are in both cases\r\n     the same: namely, free nitrogen, free hydrogen, ammonia,\r\n     methane, carbonic acid and sulphuretted hydrogen. These are\r\n     also the end-results of the disintegration of the human\r\n     body.\r\n\r\n     “After the organic nitrogen of decomposing substances has\r\n     been converted into ammonia, and to a small extent into free\r\n     nitrogen, the latter can at once be utilised by the\r\n     root-nodule organisms and other bacteria in the soil, but\r\n     the ammonia must undergo two further changes and combine\r\n     with a base to form a nitric salt before it is available for\r\n     plant life. These two changes are brought about by bacteria,\r\n     which convert the ammonia first into nitrous and then into\r\n     nitric acid; this process has been called ‘nitrification.’”\r\n\r\nIt will be clear from the foregoing remarks that the process of\r\nmineralisation is a very complicated one, which under favourable\r\nconditions, for instance in the pores of an open soil, may come to an\r\nend fairly quickly, but which under very unfavourable conditions—such\r\nas the interior of large heaps of refuse—may last many years.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Chemical purification on sewage farms.]\r\n\r\nConcerning the chemical purification effected on sewage farms, i.e.\r\nthe purification of the sewage as revealed by chemical analysis, it\r\nhas been put on record over and over again, and is now fully and\r\nuniversally understood, that suitable land well managed is capable of\r\nchanging even the foulest sewage to a perfectly clear water devoid of\r\nsmell and danger, so that this point need not be laboured here. For\r\ninstance, on the Berlin sewage farms the degree of purification\r\nattained has averaged for a period of 20 years 97 per cent., and on\r\nthe farm at Gennevilliers—one of the Paris sewage farms—the effluent\r\nis so sparkling, bright and clear that the inhabitants drink it in\r\npreference to other available water.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Micro-organic purity of effluent from sewage farms.]\r\n\r\nBut in reference to the purity of the effluent as to the products of\r\nmicro-organic activity and pathogenic micro-organisms, it will be\r\nnecessary to make a few observations with a view to remove\r\nmisconceptions that have from time to time been put forward.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ptomaines have not been found in effluents from well\r\nmanaged sewage farms.]\r\n\r\nThe question whether the specific products of putrefaction, i.e. the\r\nputrefactive alkaloids “ptomaines and toxines,” are capable of doing\r\nfurther mischief by escaping with the effluent into the stream, may be\r\nanswered as follows. These substances are fortunately very unstable,\r\nand the experiments conducted by Falk and others seem further to\r\nindicate that soil is capable of retaining them and of rendering them\r\nharmless. At any rate there is no well authenticated case on record\r\nof these bodies having wrought mischief on sewage farms. (See here\r\nalso the remarks made on pages 51 and 52 under the heading “The\r\nAbsorbing Powers of Soil.”)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Pathogenic germs on sewage farms.]\r\n\r\nIt has further been maintained that the presence of pathogenic\r\norganisms on sewage farms might in two ways lead to mischief, viz.\r\neither by transmission through air or by transmission through water.\r\nThe pathogenic organisms after spreading over the land might rise into\r\nthe air through the movements of the atmosphere and then be carried\r\nabout by it, or they might escape through the land and be conveyed\r\nwith the effluent into the stream or river that takes the latter.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Pasteur’s fears as to mischief likely to be brought about\r\nby pathogenic micro-organisms on sewage farms not borne out by facts.]\r\n\r\nIn connection with this point it may not be without interest to\r\nmention here that even the late M. Pasteur at one time of his career\r\nconsidered the wholesale spreading of disease germs on sewage farms\r\nmight prove highly injurious to the public health of the\r\nneighbourhood. As he himself admitted, he based his fears on purely\r\ntheoretical considerations and opposed, for this reason, the extension\r\nof the sewage farms in the neighbourhood of Paris. But when, later on,\r\nhe was made acquainted with the results observed on the Berlin farms,\r\nhe tacitly modified his views and ceased to oppose the extension of\r\nthe Paris farms.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: No well-authenticated case is on record where a sewage farm\r\nhas acted as the focus of a local outbreak of typhoid fever.]\r\n\r\nIndeed, search as I might, I have not been able to discover one single\r\ninstance where a sewage farm has acted as the focus of a local\r\noutbreak. On the contrary, during one or two small epidemics of\r\ntyphoid fever in Berlin, no case of this complaint has been observed\r\non the sewage farms of that city.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Experience on the Berlin farms.]\r\n\r\nConcerning the escape of pathogenic micro-organisms into streams and\r\nrivers, no case is on record where such a thing has actually occurred:\r\nindeed, the very painstaking investigations on the Berlin farms have\r\nled to negative results.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Observations made at the Freiburg sewage farm.]\r\n\r\nAnother sewage farm, that of Freiburg in Baden, has likewise been made\r\nthe subject of careful and long-continued investigation by Dr. Korn,\r\nwho, for the twelve months ending August 1897, made no less than 165\r\nelaborate chemical and bacteriological examinations. Summing up his\r\nobservations on the presence of bacteria in the effluents from subsoil\r\ndrains, he remarks:\r\n\r\n     “Apart from the few exceptional cases of high numbers, generally\r\n     speaking my experiments show that the number of germs in the\r\n     subsoil drain effluents is relatively small, and even omitting\r\n     these experiments, in which a dilution with subsoil water must\r\n     have taken place, the number of micro-organisms is still so small\r\n     that the effects of filtration through soil are clearly\r\n     perceptible. In addition to this—and this is of considerable\r\n     importance in forming a judgment—it must be borne in mind that\r\n     the bacteria in sewage are principally derived from the\r\n     intestines, whereas in the subsoil drain effluents the\r\n     inhabitants of the intestines are either not present at all or\r\n     only in very small numbers compared with the number of soil and\r\n     water bacteria, which are always present. Out of 165 examinations\r\n     I only succeeded in 18 cases in proving the presence of bacterium\r\n     coli.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bacterium coli no longer a true criterion of sewage\r\npollution.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dr. Weissenfels’ conclusions.]\r\n\r\nIt may be convenient to point out in this place that bacterium coli\r\ncan no longer be looked upon as a typical inhabitant of the human\r\nintestines after the very elaborate investigations carried out by Dr.\r\nWeissenfels, who arrived at the following conclusions:\r\n\r\n1. The so-called bacterium coli can be cultivated from almost every\r\nkind of water, and its presence can be demonstrated in nearly every\r\ncase, provided a sufficient volume of water is utilised.\r\n\r\n2. It is not possible by the result of the experiments upon animals to\r\ndecide whether the bacterium coli was cultivated from a pure or\r\ninfected water, and the discovery of a virulent bacterium coli in any\r\nsample of water cannot, therefore, be regarded as a criterion that\r\nsuch water has been polluted with fæcal bacteria.\r\n\r\nAfter these remarks, it would seem quite possible that the bacterium\r\ncoli discovered in eighteen cases by Dr. Korn in the Freiburg\r\neffluents was not derived from sewage at all but from the ordinary\r\nsubsoil water of the land.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The possibility of further mischief by pathogenic\r\nmicro-organisms on sewage farms is exceedingly remote, if it exists at\r\nall.]\r\n\r\nBearing these observations in mind, it is quite clear, therefore, that\r\nneither theoretical investigations, as available up to now, nor\r\npractical results, support the theory that pathogenic micro-organisms\r\nmay do mischief on sewage farms, and one is forced to conclude that\r\nthis possibility—if it exists at all—after systematic treatment on\r\nland is an exceedingly remote one.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sewage farms reduce the quantity of final effluent.]\r\n\r\nBefore concluding these remarks on the natural purification of sewage\r\nit is necessary to draw attention to another considerable advantage\r\nwhich it possesses over artificial sewage treatments, and that is the\r\nreduction in quantity of the effluent, which at times is very\r\nconsiderable, whereas in the artificial methods such a reduction is\r\ncomparatively small.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Loss of liquid by evaporation and by plant life.]\r\n\r\nSpread over a large area of land, well cropped, evaporation is very\r\nactive—especially during the summer months, when the flow of water in\r\nthe brook that takes the effluent is as a rule at its lowest; and, in\r\naddition to this, the growing plants further abstract a considerable\r\namount of the liquid that finds its way into the soil, so that the\r\nquantity of the effluent may not be more than from 30 to 50 per cent.\r\nof the total quantity that was poured over the land. In the artificial\r\ntreatment the evaporation is considerably smaller, and as plants are\r\naltogether absent the quantity of the effluent is probably about 90\r\nper cent. and more of the total quantity of the raw sewage. This is a\r\npoint of very considerable importance so far as the influence of the\r\neffluent upon the water in the stream that takes the same is\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\nAlthough the subject of natural purification is by no means exhausted,\r\nit is now time to direct attention to artificial methods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV. ARTIFICIAL SELF-PURIFICATION OF SEWAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. GENERAL OBSERVATIONS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Enumeration of more important experiments.]\r\n\r\nA great many experiments have been made during the last ten years with\r\nartificial processes for the self-purification of sewage, and amongst\r\nthe more important the following may be mentioned:\r\n\r\n  London experiments.\r\n  Sutton      „\r\n  Exeter      „\r\n  Manchester  „\r\n  Leeds       „\r\n  Sheffield   „\r\n  Leicester   „\r\n  York        „\r\n  Hamburg     „\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Experiments have not been conducted on uniform lines.]\r\n\r\nA casual observer might, therefore, consider himself justified in\r\nthinking that all these experiments had added a great deal to our\r\nknowledge of the intricate changes taking place in these processes,\r\nbut such a conclusion would not be justified in reality. For beyond\r\nsettling questions of local importance by chemical analysis, the\r\nexperiments, owing to a variety of causes, have not materially\r\nenhanced the stores of our information, indeed not unfrequently the\r\nresults obtained are apparently contradictory and bewildering.\r\n\r\nAn experiment must be looked upon as a question addressed to nature,\r\nand the answer will depend on the way the question has been put. If\r\nthis way differs in every case it must be clear that the answer, too,\r\nwill differ in every case, and it is this absence of uniformity which\r\ngreatly reduces the general value of these experiments.\r\n\r\nThese remarks must not be misunderstood to convey the impression as if\r\nthe experiments had not been conducted with care and skill! Far from\r\nit! Some of them have been made with the greatest skill and care and\r\nwith the very evident desire to arrive at correct conclusions, and it\r\nis only when they are placed side by side with other experiments, with\r\na view to deducing from them general conclusions concerning the\r\nprocesses at work, that great difficulties are experienced. The result\r\nof each experiment is governed by a large number of factors, which by\r\nslightly different manipulations may attain in this ever-fluctuating\r\nprocess different weights, so that the results may be contradictory,\r\nand it is only by arranging these factors on a common basis, as it\r\nwere, and by addressing the questions to nature in the same systematic\r\nand uniform way, that good general results may be expected.\r\n\r\nIt is well known, for instance, that in some cases septic tanks have\r\nnot given good results, whilst in others they have worked very well;\r\nagain, continuous filtration has failed in some experiments, whilst in\r\nothers, notably in the York experiments, it has given good results.\r\n\r\nIf, therefore, in future the mistake of the past is to be avoided, it\r\nwill be necessary to settle on a common line of action in all\r\nexperiments.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Attempt to evolve general theory.]\r\n\r\nIn spite of all the difficulties which beset such a task, an attempt\r\nwill be made in the following observations to evolve some general\r\ntheory concerning the processes at work in the artificial\r\nself-purification of sewage. Such a theory, it is quite clear, cannot\r\nbe complete in the present state of our knowledge, and it is sincerely\r\nhoped that the many and serious gaps will be filled up by later\r\ninvestigations.\r\n\r\nFor convenience of reference the different forms of the process, such\r\nas are now employed, shall be dealt with separately, commencing with\r\ncontact or oxidation beds.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. ARTIFICIAL SELF-PURIFICATION OF SEWAGE IN INTERMITTENT CONTACT\r\nBEDS.\r\n\r\nAt the outset it may not be out of place to make a few remarks\r\nconcerning the various names given to this form of application. The\r\nterm “intermittent contact bed” is here used to distinguish this kind\r\nof bed from the “continuous contact bed,” frequently called\r\n“continuous filtration.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Names of process misleading.]\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Name of Process._—This process has frequently been called\r\n“biological process,” “bacteriological process,” “contact bed system”\r\nor “oxidation bed system,” but all these terms do not appear to define\r\nit sufficiently, as they do not cover the whole, but only phases or\r\nstages in the same; hence, they do not seem appropriate.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Biological process.]\r\n\r\nThe name “biological process” is decidedly misleading, for besides\r\nbiological agencies there are also at work physical (mechanical) and\r\nchemical ones.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bacteriological process.]\r\n\r\nThe term “bacteriological or bacterial process” is likewise erroneous,\r\nfor besides bacteria a number of other micro-organisms participate in\r\nit—such as yeast fungi, mould fungi, algæ, protozoa, and even higher\r\nforms of life, such as earthworms and insects.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Contact bed system.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Oxidation bed system.]\r\n\r\nThe expressions “contact bed system” or “oxidation bed system” are in\r\nso far inappropriate as they describe only portions of the process but\r\nnot the whole. The term “contact bed” describes the first stage, and\r\nthe term “oxidation bed” portion of the second stage only.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Term most suitable.]\r\n\r\nThe term which seems most suitable of all is “artificial\r\nself-purification in contact beds,” as it includes every phase of this\r\nlengthy process applied in an artificial form; the term “natural\r\nself-purification” being applied to land treatment of sewage, as it is\r\nthe only method in which the self-purifying powers are employed under\r\nnatural conditions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Working operations.]\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Explanation of Process._—The cycle of operations commences with\r\nthe filling of the bed, and during the same the sewage comes gradually\r\nin contact with the filling material. When the bed is full, the inflow\r\nis stopped and the sewage allowed to remain in contact with the\r\nmaterial for some time. The bed is then emptied, and a period of rest\r\nis given it before the filling is commenced again.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Purification of sewage in full bed due to absorbing powers\r\nof filling material and only to a small extent due to activity of\r\nmicro-organisms.]\r\n\r\nIt has been held, that while the sewage is in the contact bed it\r\nundergoes a very rapid process of decomposition by bacteria, but it\r\nmust be evident, that as the sewage—including filling—remains only for\r\nabout two hours in the bed, the micro-organisms would have to work at\r\nan express rate. This fact alone is apt to make this theory very\r\ndoubtful, but apart from it, it has been proved by experiments that\r\nthe by far greater amount of purification—whilst the sewage is in the\r\nbeds—is due to the absorbing powers of the filling material, which are\r\nderived from the surface attraction of its component particles.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Retention of suspended matters by bed.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Absorbing powers of filling material.]\r\n\r\nThe filling material retains in its upper layers the suspended\r\nmatters, which it strains out of the sewage in a purely mechanical\r\nmanner, much after the fashion of a screen, and when the bed is filled\r\nits absorbing powers come into play, which cause the removal of the\r\ndissolved matters out of the liquid and their retention on the surface\r\nof the particles. This latter process is probably a chemico-physical\r\none assisted by the micro-organic life in the sewage.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Decomposition of organic substances by micro-organisms when\r\nbed is empty.]\r\n\r\nIt is only after the bed has been emptied that the real activity of\r\nthe vast number of micro-organisms commences, which is directed\r\ntowards converting the organic substances into mineral ones. This\r\nprocess of splitting up, decomposing, disintegrating and mineralising\r\norganic waste products is an exceedingly complex one, which ever\r\nfluctuates according to the prevailing conditions, and which does not\r\ncome to an end until finally stable mineral forms are reached. In the\r\npresence of a plentiful supply of oxygen, the process proceeds as a\r\nrule at a more rapid rate, and the intermediate forms produced are\r\nless complex than in the comparative or total absence of this gas;\r\nhence the progress of the process is largely determined by it. The\r\namount of oxygen necessary for bacterial activity is partly\r\nabstracted, and with extraordinary energy, from the atmospheric air in\r\nthe pores of the filling material, and a portion of the substances\r\nformed, such as carbonic acid and nitrogen—in gas form—escape into the\r\natmosphere, whilst the remaining portions are washed out of the bed\r\nwith other products, such as nitric acid, by the effluent.\r\n\r\nFurther remarks upon this process of mineralisation have been made in\r\nconnection with the subject of natural self-purification of sewage,\r\nand these may be referred to here.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Effluent from bed practically raw sewage as far as its\r\nbacterial contents are concerned.]\r\n\r\nThe effect of the bed upon the bacterial flora of sewage is, as was to\r\nbe expected, but very slight, and it is on record now that, as far as\r\nthe micro-organic life is concerned, the effluent is to all intents\r\nand purposes raw sewage.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Silting up of bed.]\r\n\r\nSome of the substances contained in raw sewage remain in the bed, no\r\nmatter how carefully the sewage has been previously strained, and\r\nthese, in combination with the slimy surface coating of the component\r\nparticles, the accumulation of mineralised substances in the pores,\r\nthe consolidation of the bed, the disintegration of the filling\r\nmaterial, and the liquid retained, lead gradually but surely to the\r\nsilting or sludging up of the bed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Theoretical original water capacity of bed.]\r\n\r\n(_c_) _Water Capacity of Bed and Silting up._—The theoretical water\r\ncapacity of the bed, previous to commencing operations, is the\r\naggregate of the cubical space occupied by the pores or small passages\r\nbetween the particles forming the filling material, and the pores of\r\nthe filling material itself; but in practice a certain amount of this\r\nspace is occupied by air, which it is impossible to dislodge\r\naltogether in filling. The aggregate of the cubical space of the pores\r\nmay be called the pore-volume.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to lay down general rules as to what the original\r\nwater capacity of a bed should be expressed in per cent. of the space\r\noccupied by the filling material, but speaking within fairly wide\r\nlimits the following is somewhat near the truth.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Original water capacity with spherical particles of uniform\r\nsize.]\r\n\r\nWhen the particles forming the filling material are fairly spherical\r\nand of equal size, the original water capacity of a bed amounts to\r\nabout 38 per cent. of the space occupied by the filling material; but\r\nas in practice it is difficult to obtain spherical particles of\r\nuniform size, the original water capacity is found to range from 35 to\r\n45 per cent. of this space.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Original water capacity with particles of different sizes.]\r\n\r\nWhen, however, the particles are of materially different sizes, and\r\nwhen the smaller ones fill up the spaces between the larger ones, the\r\noriginal water capacity may sink down to as low as from 5 to 10 per\r\ncent. of the space occupied by the filling material.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Size of particles of filling material does, under certain\r\nconditions, not affect original water capacity of bed.]\r\n\r\nIt has been further demonstrated that the water capacity of a bed is\r\nnot affected by the size of the particles, provided the latter are\r\nspherical and of uniform size. In other words, the water capacity of\r\ntwo beds filled with material of different sizes is the same, provided\r\nthe particles are spherical and of uniform size throughout each bed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Silting up of bed during regular work.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rapid initial decrease of capacity.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Consolidation of bed.]\r\n\r\nThis original water capacity is, however, not maintained in regular\r\nwork, as has been pointed out already. Basing the observations on\r\nregular work only, the original capacity decreases at first, after a\r\nnew bed has been started or after an old reconstructed bed has been\r\ntaken in hand, rapidly for some time and afterwards more slowly.\r\nGraphically expressed, this decrease is not represented by a straight\r\nline but approaches more nearly a parabolic curve. This initial rapid\r\ndecrease is chiefly due to the consolidation of the bed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Disintegration of filling material.]\r\n\r\nIn connection with the movements in the bed tending towards its\r\nconsolidation, it is also clear that the continual filling and\r\nemptying operations cause the smaller particles to be washed out of\r\ntheir original position and to be placed in the larger passages\r\nbetween the filling material, and if this process is assisted by the\r\ngradual disintegration of the particles composing the filling\r\nmaterial, it is clear that the pores must become smaller and smaller\r\nin time, i.e. choked.\r\n\r\nFrom these observations it follows that the filling material should be\r\na hard substance, which will only to a limited extent be subject to\r\nthis crumbling away process.\r\n\r\nBut besides these there are, as has already been pointed out, other\r\nsilting up agencies at work.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Water-retentive power of filling material.]\r\n\r\nOf the total quantity of sewage which has entered the bed a small\r\nportion will always remain in it owing to the water retaining power of\r\nthe material. This power has sometimes been called “minimum water\r\ncapacity,” but as this name is liable to be misunderstood, it is\r\nbetter to adopt here the term “water-retentive power” of material.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of the sewage retained by the bed varies with the\r\nmaterial and pore-volume, and is due to adhesion and capillary\r\nattraction. The greater the pore-volume, and the greater the\r\npercentage of fine pores, the greater is the quantity thus retained.\r\nClean gravel retains about 12 per cent. and fine sand about 84 per\r\ncent. of its water capacity—i.e. expressed per cubic yard of filling\r\nmaterial, one cubic yard of clean gravel will retain about 10 gallons\r\nand one cubic yard of fine sand about 70 gallons of water.\r\n\r\nThrough draining a bed for several hours through evaporation and other\r\natmospheric influence, a portion of the sewage retained is lost, but\r\nthe quantity so lost will vary continually with the circumstances\r\nunder which the bed is worked.\r\n\r\nThe water-retentive power of the filling material does not decrease\r\nwith the working of the bed, but increases, which in a large measure\r\nis probably due to the slimy coat which forms round the surface of the\r\ncomponent particles, and to which reference is made in the following\r\nparagraph.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Slimy surface coating of component particles.]\r\n\r\nA further silting-up agency is the slimy surface coating of the\r\nparticles of the filling material. This accumulation is well known to\r\nall who have had to do with intermittent contact beds, and has been\r\ndescribed as spongy bacterial growth. The Manchester report for the\r\nyear ending March 27, 1901, contains on page 62 the following passage:\r\n“This (spongy bacterial growth) is at once the cause of increased\r\nefficiency in the bed and loss of capacity. On examining the material\r\nof a contact bed in active condition, every piece is seen to be coated\r\nover with a slimy growth. If this is removed it soon dries to a stiff\r\njelly, which can be cut with a knife. Under the microscope masses of\r\nbacteria and zoogloea will be found to be present.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Accumulations of decomposed substances in the pores.]\r\n\r\nIn addition to this slimy surface-coating of the particles, there are\r\nalso found in the pores, especially in the upper layers of the filling\r\nmaterial—and in fine beds more so than in a coarse bed—accumulations\r\nwhich are “akin to humus or garden soil.” They contain to a limited\r\nextent only putrescible substances, and appear to be the remains of\r\norganic matter decomposed by the activity of micro-organisms.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Periods of rest will not permanently restore portion of the\r\noriginal water capacity of the bed.]\r\n\r\nIt was formerly maintained with considerable persistency that periods\r\nof rest would permanently restore to a systematically worked bed a\r\nportion of its lost water capacity, but such a contention has been\r\nproved to be wrong. It is quite true that immediately after periods of\r\nrest an increase of the water capacity is very noticeable, which is\r\nprobably due to drying up processes within the bed during the rest,\r\nbut such an increase is not permanent and is lost again more or less\r\nquickly; it is therefore only temporary and not permanent.\r\n\r\nWhere, however, a bed has not been systematically worked, i.e. where\r\nit has been worked at a greater rate than is suitable, and where in\r\nconsequence of this a large quantity of undecomposed substances is\r\nstored in it, a period of rest may permanently restore a portion of\r\nthe lost capacity; but this is due to the mineralisation of these\r\nundecomposed organic substances during the rest.\r\n\r\nIt follows from these remarks, as has been stated above, that when the\r\norganic substances are regularly decomposed during systematic work a\r\nperiod of rest cannot materially affect the water capacity, and that\r\nwhere a considerable permanent restoration of the water capacity takes\r\nplace the bed has not been properly worked.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Decrease of capacity is accompanied to some extent by\r\nincrease of efficiency and _vice versa_.]\r\n\r\nIt would, however, be incorrect to assume that the silting up of the\r\nbed affects its efficiency besides reducing the capacity. On the\r\ncontrary! To some extent decrease of capacity is accompanied by\r\nincrease of efficiency and _vice versa_!\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Higher capacity of beds in summer than in winter.]\r\n\r\nAt this point it ought to be stated that in the Manchester experiments\r\n(see page 61 of the report for the year ending 27th March, 1901) a\r\nhigher average capacity is maintained during the summer than during\r\nthe winter, which is no doubt due to the greater activity of the\r\nmicro-organisms during the warm weather of the year.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Raking of beds not advantageous.]\r\n\r\nThe raking of the surface does not materially affect the capacity of\r\nthe bed, and it is better to scrape off the matters retained on the\r\nsurface than to rake them into the body of the bed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Renovation of filling material either partially or wholly.]\r\n\r\nIt will be clear from these observations that, no matter how carefully\r\nthe bed has been worked, sooner or later a time will come when the\r\ndecrease of capacity becomes so pronounced as to render it impossible\r\nany longer to treat the daily flow of sewage with the available plant;\r\nand when this point has been reached a renovation, either partially or\r\nwholly, of the filling material becomes an inevitable necessity.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Minimum capacity of beds to be provided for.]\r\n\r\nTo provide for this at the outset, and thus avoid the difficulties of\r\nreduced capacity, it seems advisable to lay down, when designing the\r\nworks, a minimum capacity, which will just allow the daily volume of\r\nsewage to be treated by the plant, and which when reached will\r\nnecessitate the cleansing of the bed.\r\n\r\nThe idea, formerly frequently expressed, that the filling material\r\nwhen rationally worked need not be renewed or renovated, can no longer\r\nbe maintained and is outside the reach of practical possibilities.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Underdrainage of intermittent contact beds.]\r\n\r\nAt this place a word or two about the under drainage of intermittent\r\ncontact beds may not be out of place. It is of the greatest importance\r\nthat all drains should work well, and that the entrance of the sewage\r\ninto them should not lead to disturbance in the filling material,\r\nespecially should the tearing of portions of the filling material into\r\nthe drain pipes be avoided.\r\n\r\nBy carefully arranging the position, number, size and fall of the\r\nmaster drains and branch drains, it is possible to reduce the\r\nresistance so as to allow of a fairly even flow of sewage through all\r\nthe drains, and to prevent a great rush of water through the drains\r\nnear the outlet end.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The presence of lime is of no consequence.]\r\n\r\nIn passing it may not be out of place to point out that the view,\r\nformerly expressed, that an admixture of lime in some form would prove\r\nadvantageous to the purification of sewage, is not supported by the\r\nexperience gained.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Absorbing effect increases with the time of contact.]\r\n\r\n(_d_) _Absorbing Powers of Filling Material._—The absorbing effect of\r\nany filling material seems to increase with the time of contact.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Absorbing powers increase until bed has become ripe.]\r\n\r\nIt ought further to be pointed out that the absorbing powers of the\r\nfilling material gradually increase until the bed has become ripe.\r\nThis fact was formerly stated to be due to the development of the\r\nproper micro-organisms within the bed, but it would seem to be\r\nchiefly due to the slimy surface coating of the particles of the\r\nfilling material, or spongy bacterial growth, as it has frequently\r\nbeen called, which does not only assist mechanical filtration but also\r\npossesses high powers of absorbing oxygen.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Absorbing powers soon cease in the absence of\r\nmicro-organisms and air.]\r\n\r\nBut it cannot be open to doubt that the absorbing powers of the\r\nfilling material are dependent in some way or other on the presence of\r\nmicro-organisms, for Dunbar has shown that in the absence of\r\nmicro-organisms and without periods of aeration these powers soon\r\ncease.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Oxygen is absorbed from air in the pores with great\r\nenergy.]\r\n\r\n(_e_) _Consumption of Oxygen by the Filling Material._—The oxygen\r\nnecessary for the proper work of an intermittent contact bed is\r\nabstracted with great energy from the atmospheric air, with which the\r\npores become filled during periods of rest. Through diffusion, and\r\nthrough the vacuum created by the processes of absorption, further\r\nquantities of oxygen are taken from the atmospheric air, even under\r\ndifficult conditions, and, as pointed out in the Manchester report for\r\nthe year ending 27th March, 1901, “there is, therefore, little need to\r\nforce air into a bed.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The oxygen taken up during aeration is not imparted to the\r\nsewage at the next filling and does not escape in the effluent.]\r\n\r\nThe oxygen thus taken up is not imparted in gas form to the sewage\r\nduring the next filling, and the effluents from intermittent contact\r\nbeds are not saturated with oxygen. Dunbar states that the effluents\r\nof a satisfactorily worked bed frequently only contain one cubic\r\ncentimetre of free oxygen per litre. Clowes reports a similar result\r\nin his third report on the London experiments.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The greatest quantity of oxygen is consumed during the\r\noxidation of the products formed by micro-organisms.]\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that by far the greatest quantity of oxygen is\r\nconsumed during the process of oxidation of the products formed by\r\nmicro-organisms from putrescible organic substances.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Consumption of oxygen and formation of carbonic acid not\r\nsolely due to biological agencies.]\r\n\r\n(_f_) _Formation of Carbonic Acid._—Dunbar has shown by his\r\nexperiments that the consumption of oxygen and the formation of\r\ncarbonic acid is not solely due to biological agencies, but is to some\r\nextent the result of physico-chemical processes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: More free carbonic acid contained in the effluent than in\r\nthe raw sewage.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: By far the greatest portion of carbonic acid escapes into\r\nthe air.]\r\n\r\nHe further reports that in his experiments the effluents contained on\r\nan average 100 milligram per litre more free carbonic acid than the\r\nraw sewage, and that the quantity contained in the effluents\r\nrepresents only a small portion of the total amount of carbonic acid\r\nformed during the whole process. The by far greatest portion of\r\ncarbonic acid escapes into the air. Concerning the air in the pores of\r\nthe filling material during periods of aeration, Dunbar states that it\r\ncontains sometimes not less than from 6 to 10 per cent. carbonic acid.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Nitrogen escapes in gas form into the air.]\r\n\r\n(_g_) _Nitrogen._—It is quite clear from all experiments that a\r\nconsiderable amount of the total nitrogen contained in raw sewage is\r\nabstracted by the filling material of intermittent contact beds, and\r\nit is interesting to ascertain what becomes of it! Does it accumulate\r\nin the bed? In that case, one has a right to assume that the\r\nsatisfactory work of the bed would gradually cease! As this is,\r\nhowever, not the case, and as, further, the sludge formed in the bed,\r\nwhether it be fairly fresh or very stale, only contains a very small\r\namount of total nitrogen, we must surmise that the nitrogen after its\r\nretention by the bed escapes in gas form—like the carbonic acid—into\r\nthe atmosphere.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The presence of nitric acid is not an unfailing guide for\r\ndetermining the satisfactory character of the effluent.]\r\n\r\n(_h_) _The Formation of Nitric Acid._—Concerning the presence of\r\nnitric acid in the effluents from intermittent contact beds, Dunbar is\r\nof opinion that it offers certain means for forming an opinion of the\r\nprocesses taking place in the same, but that it is only in a\r\nsubordinate sense an indication of the degree of purification attained\r\nand must not be taken as an unfailing guide for determining the\r\nsatisfactory character of the effluent.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Nitrifying bacteria always present in town’s sewage.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Nitric acid is formed very rapidly, but only during periods\r\nof rest.]\r\n\r\nNitrifying bacteria are always present in ordinary town’s sewage, but\r\nit would appear that other micro-organisms besides Winogradsky’s\r\nbacteria assist in the process of nitrification. Nitric acid is formed\r\nvery rapidly, but only during periods of rest, and besides aeration\r\nother less powerful influences are at work.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reduction of nitric acid when bed is filled from bottom\r\nwith an upward flow.]\r\n\r\nIt is further interesting to note that, according to Dunbar, the\r\ngreater portion of nitric acid which has been formed during periods of\r\naeration becomes completely reduced in a very short time, when the bed\r\nis filled with an upward flow from the bottom, and that only a small\r\nportion remains in the form of nitrous acid.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. ARTIFICIAL SELF-PURIFICATION OF SEWAGE IN SEPTIC TANKS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Septic tanks only used in combination with contact beds.]\r\n\r\nAlthough it has never been claimed, and is further not open to doubt,\r\nthat a septic tank alone and unaided by subsequent treatment in\r\nintermittent or continuous contact beds does not sufficiently purify\r\nthe sewage, in these remarks the work of the septic tank only will be\r\nconsidered, as the treatment in contact beds will be dealt with\r\nseparately.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Septic tank a suitable name.]\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Name of Septic Tank._—A good many names have been suggested by\r\ndifferent observers—such as “anaerobic fermentation tank,” “putrefying\r\ntank,” “liquefying tank,” “cess-pit,” etc.—but there appears to be no\r\nreason why the name “septic tank” should not be adhered to, as it\r\ndescribes sufficiently correctly the work done by the tank, which is\r\nchiefly of a septic nature.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Covered or Open Septic Tank._—Before dealing with the processes\r\ntaking place in a septic tank, it will not be out of place to consider\r\nhere, shortly, whether a closed septic tank confers advantages over an\r\nopen septic tank sufficiently great to justify the considerably\r\ngreater expenditure necessitated by its construction.\r\n\r\nIt is well known, that at Exeter in the first experimental\r\ninstallation of this process, the septic tank was covered in by an\r\narched roof; but subsequent experiments made elsewhere do not seem to\r\nsupport the theory then advanced, that such a tank should be a closed\r\none. This is chiefly due to the thick skin which, after a few months’\r\nwork, forms on the surface of closed or open tanks, and which\r\naccording to locality and season may reach a thickness of from 1 to 2\r\nfeet; it is maintained then that this cheap natural cover does away\r\nwith the expensive artificial cover.\r\n\r\nIn the report on the treatment of the Manchester sewage, by Messrs.\r\nBaldwin Latham, Percy F. Frankland and W. H. Perkin, it is stated on\r\npage 54, amongst the conclusions and recommendations, as follows:—“The\r\nanaerobic or septic process is found to take place as effectively in\r\nan open tank as in a closed one.” This conclusion does not appear to\r\nhave been modified by the experiments made subsequent to the issue of\r\nthis report.\r\n\r\nIn the Leeds experiment a similar result was obtained.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Closed septic tanks possess generally speaking no\r\nadvantages over open ones.]\r\n\r\nWhilst it would, therefore, appear to be correct to say, generally,\r\nthat closed septic tanks afford no material advantages over open ones,\r\nso far as the purification of the sewage is concerned, they may become\r\nnecessary in special cases, when the smells emanating from open ones\r\nmight create nuisances in crowded neighbourhoods.\r\n\r\nThe following remarks refer, therefore, equally to open as well as to\r\nclosed septic tanks, and no distinction will be made between them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The work in the septic tank is chiefly done by obligatory\r\nanaerobes.]\r\n\r\n(_c_) _Explanation of Process._—Although the processes taking place in\r\nseptic tanks are at present but imperfectly understood, they may be\r\nsaid to be in the main due to anaerobic micro-organisms, i.e. due to\r\nsuch micro-organisms which carry on their life’s work in the absence\r\nof oxygen. They split up or peptonise the organic compounds in the\r\nabsence of air, and the group of changes brought about by them has\r\nbeen termed “anaerobic fermentation” or “putrefaction.” During the\r\nsame, it is claimed that a considerable amount of the sludge retained\r\nin the tank is liquefied or destroyed, and that the rest becomes so\r\nchanged as to be denser than ordinary sludge, and to contain less\r\nmoisture.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dissolved matters entering and leaving the septic tank.]\r\n\r\nConcerning the amount and nature of the dissolved matters entering and\r\nleaving an open septic tank, the following is taken from the\r\nManchester report for the year ending March 27, 1901:—\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Manchester observations.]\r\n\r\n     “A series of determinations have been made of the amount of\r\n     dissolved matter entering and leaving the tank, by evaporating\r\n     known volumes of the sewage and effluent after filtration through\r\n     paper and weighing the solid residue.\r\n\r\n     “An average of six determinations (confirmed by similar\r\n     observations in connection with the closed septic tank) gave the\r\n     following results:—\r\n\r\n  ----------------------------------+--------------------------------\r\n               Raw Sewage.          |  Open Septic Tank Effluent.\r\n       Dissolved matter, grains     |   Dissolved matter, grains\r\n               per gallon.          |        per gallon.\r\n ------------+--------------+-------+----------+-------------+-------\r\n             |  Organic and |       |          | Organic and |\r\n    Mineral. |   Volatile.  | Total.| Mineral. |  Volatile.  | Total.\r\n  -----------+--------------+-------+----------+-------------+-------\r\n      33·0   |     33·0     | 66·0  |   30·8   |    25·0     | 55·8\r\n             |              |       |          |             |\r\n             |              |       |      Reduction, in per cent.\r\n             |              |       |   6·67   |    24·24    | 15·45\r\n  -----------+--------------+-------+----------+-------------+-------\r\n\r\n     “A certain amount of loss of ammonia, as ammonium carbonate, will\r\n     take place on evaporation in both cases, and this will probably\r\n     be greater with septic tank effluent.\r\n\r\n     “An examination of the residue obtained by evaporating large\r\n     quantities of open septic tank effluent (filtered through paper),\r\n     shows that the mineral matters largely consist of iron oxide,\r\n     from the decomposition of organic compounds of iron, and calcium\r\n     sulphate. Among the volatile constituents have been detected\r\n     ammonium carbonate, mercaptan-like compounds of very offensive\r\n     smell, acetic and butyric acids. No evidence of the presence of\r\n     amines could be found in the residue on evaporation, but by\r\n     distilling large volumes of the liquid and carefully analysing\r\n     the platinum salts obtained from the distillate, the presence of\r\n     amines is indicated.\r\n\r\n     “Research in this direction is being continued; careful\r\n     comparison especially will be made of the products obtained by\r\n     evaporation and distillation of crude sewage and septic tank\r\n     effluent respectively.\r\n\r\n     “The evidence, however, points to a breaking down of albuminoid\r\n     and cellulose matter in the septic tank into simpler and to some\r\n     extent volatile compounds. The reactions are probably hydrolytic\r\n     in character, ammonia, amines, carbonic acid, water, and possibly\r\n     alcohol, being produced.\r\n\r\n     “A further quantity of organic matter also disappears as methane,\r\n     nitrogen and hydrogen.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Must aerobic fermentation in all cases be preceded by\r\nanaerobic fermentation?]\r\n\r\nIt will be clear from the foregoing, that the changes going on in a\r\nseptic tank are entirely different from those brought about in contact\r\nbeds, and the question whether a septic tank is a necessity for the\r\nsubsequent contact bed treatment, or whether it is a distinct\r\ndisadvantage, can only be definitely settled when we know whether\r\naerobic fermentation, i.e. decomposition, must in all cases be\r\npreceded by anaerobic fermentation, i.e. putrefaction, and to what\r\nextent, or whether such a succession of changes is not necessary.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: At Manchester contact beds accustomed to septic tank\r\neffluent did not at once purify raw sewage.]\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note in connection with this point, that during\r\nthe Manchester experiments it was established that contact beds, which\r\nhave become accustomed to septic tank effluent, will not at once\r\npurify comparatively fresh sewage.\r\n\r\n(_d_) _Velocity of Flow through Tank._—The velocity of flow through\r\nthe septic tank is of great importance, as on it depends the size of\r\nthe installation.\r\n\r\nIt seems to have become a habit to express this velocity by the length\r\nof the sojourn of the sewage in the septic tank—for instance, “the\r\nflow of sewage through the tank was such that it would fill it in\r\ntwenty-four hours”; but as all tanks vary in size, and as in\r\nconsequence the distance which has to be traversed by the sewage from\r\nthe entrance to the exit in twenty-four hours is different in nearly\r\nevery case, such a habit is, to say the very least, very misleading.\r\n\r\nIt will not be disputed that the deposition of the suspended solids in\r\nsewage is dependent on the rate of movement of the liquid, and that in\r\na quickly moving liquid there will be less deposition than in a very\r\nslowly travelling liquid.\r\n\r\n  -----------------+----------+---------+-----------+-------------\r\n        Town.      | Length.  |  Width. |   Depth.  |  Contents.\r\n  -----------------+----------+---------+-----------+-------------\r\n                   |          |         |           |\r\n                   |  feet.   |   feet. |  ft. in.  |   gallons.\r\n  Manchester tanks |   300    |   100   |   6  0    |  1,125,000\r\n                   |          |         |           |\r\n  Leeds        “   |   100    |    60   |   7  7    |    250,000\r\n  -----------------+----------+---------+-----------+-------------\r\n\r\nBearing this in mind it will not be without interest to examine the\r\nvelocities employed during the Manchester and Leeds experiments. The\r\ntanks employed in these have the dimensions given in the table on the\r\npreceding page.\r\n\r\nNow assuming that each tank is to be filled once in twenty-four hours\r\nwe obtain the following velocities:\r\n\r\n     Manchester (300′ 0″ × 12″)/1440 = 2″·5 per minute.\r\n     Leeds      (100′ 0″ × 12″)/1440 = 0″·84 per minute.\r\n\r\nWhich means that in the Manchester experiments the velocity would have\r\nbeen three times as large as in Leeds; and it is clear that if the\r\nsewage of both towns was identical the results, so far as the\r\nretention of the suspended matters in the tanks are concerned, could\r\nnot have been identical. As a matter of fact, considerably greater\r\nvelocities have been used in the Manchester experiments, as will be\r\nshown later on.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rate of flow through septic tanks should not be expressed\r\nby the length of sojourn in tank but by some linear measurement in a\r\nstated time.]\r\n\r\nIt will be clear from this, that it is most misleading and erroneous\r\nto express the rate of flow by the length of the sojourn of the sewage\r\nin the tank, and that the velocity should in each case be expressed by\r\nsome linear measurement in a stated time—probably inches per minute.\r\n\r\nThe next point to consider is the velocity to be employed in septic\r\ntanks; and here it is not without interest to refer to the various\r\nexperiments enumerated with their results in the next table.\r\n\r\nThe difference in the results obtained, so far as the suspended\r\nmatters are concerned, is probably due to the different character of\r\nthe various sewages experimented with; but so low a velocity as 0·52\r\ninch, as used in the Exeter experiments, does not appear to be\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nIn the Leeds experiments, it was found that the filling of the tank\r\nonce in twenty-four hours gave the best results; and as the velocity\r\nthen was 0·84 inch per second it will be somewhat near the mark to\r\nrecommend generally a velocity of 1 inch per minute. On the assumption\r\nthat the sewage shall remain twenty-four hours in the tank, this gives\r\na length of tank of 120 feet, which is a very suitable one.\r\n\r\nSEPTIC TANK EXPERIMENTS.\r\n\r\n_Rate of Flow and Deposition of Suspended Matters._\r\n\r\n  -----+------------+-----------------------+\r\n       |            |     Rate of Flow.     |\r\n       |            +-----------------------+\r\n       |            |           |           |\r\n   No. |   Name of  | Length of |  Velocity |\r\n       |    Town.   |  Sojourn  |  of Flow  |\r\n       |            | of Sewage |    per    |\r\n       |            |  in Tank. |  minute.  |\r\n       |            |           |           |\r\n  -----+------------+-----------+-----------+\r\n       |            |           |           |\r\n       |            |   days.   |  inches.  |\r\n    1  |   Exeter   |   1·0     |   0·52    |\r\n       |            |           |           |\r\n    2  | Manchester |   0·44    |   5·58    |\r\n       |            |           |           |\r\n    3  |     “      |   0·56    |   4·44    |\r\n       |            |           |           |\r\n    4  |   Leeds    |   0·5     |   1·68 }  |\r\n       |            |           |           |\r\n    5  |     “      |   1·0     |   0·84 }  |\r\n       |            |           |           |\r\n    6  |     “      |   2·0     |   0·42 }  |\r\n  -----+------------+-----------+-----------+\r\n\r\n  -----+-----------------------------------------------\r\n       |           Suspended Matters in Sewage.\r\n       |-----------+-----------+------------+----------\r\n       |           |           |            |\r\n   No. | Remaining | Destroyed |   Leaving  |\r\n       |    in     |    and    |    Tank    |  Total.\r\n       |   Tank.   | Liquefied |     in     |\r\n       |           |  in Tank. | Effluents. |\r\n       |           |           |            |\r\n  -----+-----------+-----------+------------+----------\r\n       |           |           |            |\r\n       | per cent. | per cent. |  per cent. |\r\n    1  |    17     |    39     |     44     |    100\r\n       |           |           |            |\r\n    2  |    41     |    22     |     37     |    100\r\n       |           |           |            |\r\n    3  |    23     |    33     |     44     |    100\r\n       |           |           |            |\r\n    4  |    ..     |    ..     |     ..     |     ..\r\n       |           |           |            |\r\n    5  |  average  |    28     |     ..     |     ..\r\n       |    say    |           |            |\r\n    6  |           |    ..     |     ..     |     ..\r\n  -----+-----------+-----------+------------+----------\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Septic tanks reduce the sludge difficulty to some extent,\r\nbut do not altogether remove it.]\r\n\r\n(_e_) _Destruction and Liquefaction of Sludge in Septic Tanks._—It was\r\nformerly maintained that the employment of a septic tank did away with\r\nall sludge difficulties, and one sees even now advertisements to that\r\neffect, that there is “no sludge” with a septic tank; but experience\r\neverywhere does not bear out this contention. On the contrary, there\r\nmust be sludge with a septic tank, and the only question one has to\r\nconsider is, to what extent does a septic tank reduce the quantity of\r\nsludge?\r\n\r\nThe table above contains the results obtained in the various\r\nexperiments, and from these it would appear as if on an average, with\r\na velocity of 1 inch per minute, 25 per cent. of the total sludge\r\nwould be destroyed or liquefied in a septic tank. Generally speaking,\r\ntherefore, the following figures will be somewhat near the mark, where\r\nthe plant is worked systematically and carefully supervised.\r\n\r\n                                                Per cent.\r\n\r\n  Suspended matters remaining in tank               35\r\n      “        “    destroyed or liquefied in tank  25\r\n      “        “    escaping in effluent            40\r\n                                                   ---\r\n                      Total                        100\r\n\r\nThese figures mean that 35 per cent. of the total suspended matters\r\nwill have to be dealt with as sludge, 25 per cent. will be destroyed\r\nor liquefied in the septic tank, and the remaining 40 per cent. will\r\nbe deposited on and in the contact beds.\r\n\r\nIt has already been pointed out that it is claimed that the septic\r\ntank sludge is denser and contains less moisture than ordinary sludge,\r\nand that about half of it is mineral matter.\r\n\r\nAs previously stated, at Manchester a reduction of about 16 per cent.\r\nin the dissolved matter has been observed in the open septic tank.\r\n\r\n(_f_) _Formation of Gas in Septic Tank._—It was at one time suggested\r\nthat the gases formed in septic tanks during anaerobic fermentation\r\nmight be utilised for lighting or heating purposes, but anyone well\r\nacquainted with the subject will admit that such a use is outside the\r\nrange of practical possibilities.\r\n\r\nAt Manchester, 100 gallons of sewage evolved in twenty-four hours\r\nabout a cubic foot of gas, which on an average contained:\r\n\r\n                              Per cent.\r\n\r\n  Marsh gas, CH{4}               73\r\n  Carbon dioxide, CO{2}           6\r\n  Hydrogen, H                     5\r\n  Nitrogen, N (by difference)    16\r\n                                ---\r\n                     Total      100\r\n\r\nAt this rate 1 million gallons of sewage will evolve 10,000 cubic feet\r\nof gas, or 0·2 tons of gas, in twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Septic tank effluent more suitable for nitrification.]\r\n\r\n(_g_) _Mixing Action of Septic Tank._—There is one advantage possessed\r\nby a septic tank which cannot be disputed, and that is the mixing\r\naction going on within it. The fresh sewage on its arrival becomes\r\nmixed with stale sewage, and, owing to the rising of lumps of sludge\r\nfrom the bottom, and other causes, the contents of the tank become of\r\na more uniform composition, which must entail a corresponding\r\nadvantage for the subsequent contact bed treatment.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The septic tank effluent is so far as bacterial purity is\r\nconcerned practically raw sewage.]\r\n\r\n(_h_) _Micro-organisms in Effluent from Septic Tank._—Although the\r\navailable number of experiments on the micro-organisms contained in\r\nthe effluent from a septic tank is not large, yet they support the\r\nconclusion which one would form by analogous reasoning, that so far as\r\nthe bacterial flora is concerned the effluent is practically raw\r\nsewage.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. CONTINUOUS CONTACT BEDS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Continuous contact beds still in an experimental stage.]\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to make at this point a few short observations on the\r\nartificial self-purification in continuous contact beds.\r\n\r\nThis method of artificial purification has frequently been called\r\n“continuous filtration,” but it will be much better to reserve the\r\nterm “filtration” for the percolation of water through fine material,\r\nsuch as sand, and to call the continuous flow of sewage through\r\ncoarser material continuous contact bed treatment, as the processes\r\ngoing on during the same are more analogous to those going on in an\r\nintermittent contact bed than to those taking place in a waterworks\r\nfilter.\r\n\r\nFormerly it was attempted to use the same kind of contact bed for\r\ncontinuous treatment as is used for intermittent treatment, but, as\r\nwas to be expected, the results obtained were so unsatisfactory that\r\nthe experiments had to be discontinued. Now somewhat different forms\r\nare utilised, which are mostly protected by patent rights, and the\r\nmode of distribution has also been altered by the introduction of\r\npatent distributors or sprinklers, which cause the sewage to fall in\r\nvery thin streams upon the filling material.\r\n\r\nIn the Manchester experiments, the proprietary continuous contact bed\r\ndoes not appear to have given satisfactory results. Better effluents\r\nwere obtained at Leeds, and at York the results obtained are said to\r\nhave been very good.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, however, it is but right to say that the experience\r\ngained so far is not sufficient to entitle us to form definite\r\nopinions, and for this reason it will be better to await further\r\nresults.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. MANAGEMENT OF PLANTS FOR THE ARTIFICIAL SELF-PURIFICATION OF\r\nSEWAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Plants for the artificial self-purification of sewage\r\nrequire very careful handling.]\r\n\r\nIt was formerly frequently concluded that neither septic tank nor\r\ncontact beds required careful superintendence, but that they could be\r\nworked by automatic machinery and left to themselves. It was therefore\r\nmaintained that the working expenses of plants of this nature would be\r\nnext to nil. This was, however, not Mr. Dibdin’s view, who, after\r\nyears of careful study, came to the conclusion that they were delicate\r\npieces of mechanism which required careful watching.\r\n\r\nSince, Mr. Dibdin’s conclusions have been amply confirmed by all\r\ncareful experimenters.\r\n\r\nFor instance, Mr. Fowler, the chemist in charge of the Manchester\r\nexperiments, observed before the Royal Commission on Sewage Disposal\r\nas follows: “It is a delicate operation (the management of septic tank\r\nand contact beds), which requires careful watching! There is no doubt\r\nwhatever about that!” (Question 5651.)\r\n\r\nAgain, the conditions of successful working of contact beds, laid down\r\nby the same gentleman on page 64 of the Manchester report for the year\r\nending March 27, 1901, are ample proof of this, and they show very\r\nclearly how extremely careful the supervision of such a plant ought to\r\nbe, and that in the hands of inexperienced men it will soon come to\r\ngrief.\r\n\r\nProfessor Percy Frankland stated in his evidence before the Royal\r\nCommission, that in his opinion land required less skilled supervision\r\nthan contact beds. (See Questions 9937, 10071-74.)\r\n\r\nA similar view was expressed by Mr. H. M. Wilson, the chief inspector\r\nof the West Riding of Yorkshire Rivers Board. (Question 6380.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.  SOME OBSERVATIONS ON THE DEPOSITION OF SUSPENDED MATTERS IN\r\nTANKS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Definition of the term “deposition.”]\r\n\r\nThe term “deposition” shall here be held to mean the precipitation of\r\nthe suspended matters without chemicals or other artificial means,\r\ni.e. the unaided subsidence of these matters at such a rate of flow\r\nthat septic action is not set up within the tanks.\r\n\r\nThe question that is of interest here, is: Which is the most\r\nfavourable rate of flow of the sewage through the tank, so far as\r\nthe deposition of the suspended matters is concerned? To some extent\r\nthe answer to this question will depend on the special characteristics\r\nof the particular sewage under consideration, but for general purposes\r\nthe following observations will not be without interest.\r\n\r\nAlthough of very great importance, this question does not appear to\r\nhave received very general consideration, as the available number of\r\ncareful experiments is but small.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tank velocity at Barking.]\r\n\r\nIt appears that the calculated velocity in the channels of the\r\nprecipitation tanks at Barking is about 4 feet per minute, and that\r\nwith this velocity about 77 per cent. of the suspended matters were\r\ndeposited in the year 1894.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tank velocity at Manchester.]\r\n\r\nAt the Manchester tanks it is stated that a velocity of 3 feet 4\r\ninches per minute is employed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Velocity frequently adopted.]\r\n\r\nA rate of velocity now frequently adopted in this country for new\r\nworks is 6 inches per minute.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Frankfort experiments.]\r\n\r\nIn the settling tanks at Frankfort on the Main there are deposited\r\nabout 84 per cent. of the suspended matters, with velocities ranging\r\nfrom 9½ inches to 16½ inches per minute.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cassel experiments.]\r\n\r\nWith a velocity of 7 inches per minute, it is stated that at the\r\nCassel sewage works 97 per cent. of the suspended matters are retained\r\nin the tanks.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hanover experiments.]\r\n\r\nAt Hanover a set of interesting observations has lately been made, on\r\ntanks 246 feet long, with a view to ascertaining the most advantageous\r\nrate of flow.\r\n\r\nWith a velocity of 9·44 inches per minute, 62·7 per cent. of the\r\nsuspended organic matters were precipitated, with a velocity of 14·17\r\ninches per minute 61·7 per cent. were deposited, and with a velocity\r\nof 35·43 inches per minute 57·3 per cent.; from which figures it will\r\nbe clear that there is not much difference in the result on the\r\nsuspended matters between these velocities.\r\n\r\nAgainst these results must be placed the results obtained with septic\r\ntanks, where, as has frequently been stated, a velocity of 1 inch per\r\nminute and a sojourn of twenty-four hours in the tank may be expected\r\nto lead to a deposition of about 60 per cent. of the suspended\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reduction of cost.]\r\n\r\nWhere, therefore, a previous septic treatment of the sewage by\r\nanaerobes is not necessary, it is clear that the substitution of\r\nordinary settling tanks for septic tanks will be accompanied by a very\r\nconsiderable reduction of cost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII. CONCLUDING REMARKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the foregoing observations were penned, the Chairman of the\r\nRoyal Commission on Sewage Disposal has delivered a very interesting\r\ninaugural address, in August last, at the Congress in Exeter of the\r\nInstitute of Public Health, to which attention ought to be drawn at\r\nthis point.\r\n\r\nAccording to _The Times_ he is reported to have stated as follows: “He\r\nregretted that he could not give some idea of the probable date at\r\nwhich the Commission would issue its final report and recommendations.\r\nThey would soon, he hoped, be able to publish the results of a\r\nprolonged investigation into the treatment of sewage on land; and\r\ntheir experts were now making elaborate parallel examinations of some\r\nof the processes of filtration by artificial means. But he feared that\r\nthey would ultimately be obliged to bring their proceedings to an\r\narbitrary close; for, however much they could learn, he was quite\r\ncertain they could never come to a point at which they could say there\r\nwas nothing more to be learned. The subject was inexhaustible.”\r\n\r\nThese very guarded observations are almost in direct contrast with the\r\nvery positive assurance of some enthusiastic supporters of artificial\r\ntreatments, who a year or two ago did not hesitate in proclaiming\r\nthroughout this country that the panacea for all sewage difficulties\r\nhad been discovered, and that the investigations of the Royal\r\nCommission were a mere matter of form and a foregone conclusion.\r\n\r\nTo all those who did not share these very sanguine expressions of\r\nfaith, and who were painfully aware of the great gaps in our knowledge\r\nof the processes taking place in sewage purification, these words of\r\nLord Iddesleigh will prove an assurance that the commissioners are not\r\nswayed by popular likes and dislikes, however fascinating they may be,\r\nbut that they are earnestly endeavouring, in an impartial manner, to\r\nthrow such light upon this abstruse question as will enable them to\r\narrive at correct conclusions.\r\n\r\nFor a like purpose the foregoing remarks have been written; and if the\r\nfacts recorded in the previous pages, and the opinions expressed\r\ntherein, should prove of assistance to anyone in forming correct\r\nviews, the labour spent on them will be amply repaid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSTSCRIPT.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the foregoing remarks were written, I have been somewhat struck\r\nwith the views expressed at one or two meetings by some of those who\r\nought to have the full facts of the case at their fingers’ ends. There\r\nseems to be a considerable vagueness as to the sanitary results to be\r\nobtained by either the natural or one of the artificial methods of\r\nsewage treatment, and with a view to making this point quite clear I\r\nhave prepared the following comparative statement (see next page),\r\nwhich, I trust, will show at a glance what one may expect from either\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nThis statement has not been prepared from experimental installations,\r\nwhere, as a rule, better results are obtained than in actual every-day\r\nwork; but it refers to fairly large works dealing from day to day with\r\nthe whole town’s sewage. It has further been assumed, that the plant\r\nboth for the natural as well as for the artificial treatment is\r\nsuitable, and managed carefully and on intelligent lines.\r\n\r\nAs in all sewage treatments the sanitary results have first to be\r\nconsidered, I have only dealt with them in the statement, but even if\r\nI had extended it to economic considerations the result would have\r\nbeen practically the same.\r\n\r\nFrom a careful examination of the facts recorded in the statement it\r\nfollows that with natural treatment we get five distinct advantageous\r\nresults, against which we have to place only two on the side of the\r\nartificial treatments; but this means, that if we wish to bring up the\r\nresults of these treatments to those obtained by the natural\r\ntreatment, we have to supplement them by three further treatments for\r\nthe extraction of pathogenic germs, and of the manurial elements, and\r\nfor the reduction of the liquid.\r\n\r\nIt is these facts which ought to be carefully considered by all those\r\nwho wish to study the comparative advantages of these two systems, or\r\nwho have to decide on a definite method to be employed in a particular\r\ncase, and no step ought to be taken before every one of these five\r\npoints has been very carefully weighed. Generally speaking, that\r\nsystem will be preferred which confers the greatest number of\r\nadvantages.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATEMENT.\r\n\r\n                  _Results to be obtained from_\r\n\r\n    (A) _Natural Treatment._         (B) _Artificial Treatment._\r\n\r\n  1.
