In\r\nhonoring Columbus they honor and exalt the sons of Catalonia, who also\r\ntook part in the discovery and civilization of the New World, among whom\r\nmay be named the Treasurer Santangel, Captain Margarit, Friar Benardo\r\nBoyl, first patriarch of the Indies, and the twelve missionaries of\r\nMonserrat, who accompanied the illustrious admiral on his second voyage.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1881, a national competition was opened by the central\r\nexecutive committee for the monument, and by the unanimous voice of\r\nthe committee the premium plans of the architect, Don Cayetano\r\nBuigas Monraba, were adopted. From these plans, which we find in _La\r\nIlustracion Española_, we give an engraving. Richness, grandeur, and\r\nexpression, worthily combined, are the characteristics of these plans.\r\nThe landing structure is divided into three parts, a central and two\r\nlaterals, each of which extends forward, after the manner of a cutwater,\r\nin the form of the bow of a vessel of the fifteenth century, bringing to\r\nmind the two caravels, the Pinta and Niña; two great lights occupy the\r\nadvance points on each side; a rich balustrade and four statues of\r\ncelebrated persons complete the magnificent frontage. A noble monument,\r\nsurmounted by a statue of the discoverer, is seen on the esplanade.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MONUMENTAL LANDING AND STATUE TO COLUMBUS, AT BARCELONA,\r\nSPAIN.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe commission appointed in France to consider the phylloxera has not\r\nawarded to anybody the prize of three hundred thousand francs that was\r\noffered to the discoverer of a trustworthy remedy or preventive for the\r\nfatal grape disease. There were not less than 182 competitors for the\r\nprize; but none had made a discovery that filled the bill. It is said,\r\nhowever, that a Strasbourg physician has found in naphthaline an\r\nabsolutely trustworthy remedy. This liquid is poured upon the ground\r\nabout the root of the vine, and it is said that it kills the parasites\r\nwithout hurting the grape.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENERY ON THE UTAH LINE OF THE DENVER AND RIO GRANDE.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. R.W. Raymond gives the following interesting account of the\r\nremarkable scenery on this recently opened route from Denver to Salt\r\nLake:\r\n\r\nHaving just made the trip from Salt Lake City to this place on the\r\nDenver & Rio Grande line, I cannot write you on any other subject at\r\npresent. There is not in the world a railroad journey of thirty hours\r\nso filled with grand and beautiful views. I should perhaps qualify this\r\nstatement by deducting the hours of darkness; yet this is really a\r\nfortunate enhancement of the traveler's enjoyment; it seems providential\r\nthat there is one part of the way just long enough and uninteresting\r\nenough to permit one to go to sleep without the fear of missing anything\r\nsublime. Leaving Salt Lake City at noon, we sped through the fertile and\r\npopulous Jordan Valley, past the fresh and lovely Utah Lake, and up the\r\nValley of Spanish Fork. All the way the superb granite walls and summits\r\nof the Wahsatch accompanied us on the east, while westward, across the\r\nwide valley, were the blue outlines of the Oquirrh range. One after\r\nanother of the magnificent cañons of the Wahsatch we passed, their\r\nmouths seeming mere gashes in the massive rock, but promising wild and\r\nrugged variety to him who enters--a promise which I have abundantly\r\ntested in other days. Parley's Cañon, the Big and Little Cottonwood, and\r\nmost wonderful of all, the cañon of the American Fork, form a series not\r\ninferior to those of Boulder, Clear Creek, the Platte, and the Arkansas,\r\nin the front range of the Rockies.\r\n\r\nFollowing Spanish Fork eastward so far as it served our purpose, we\r\ncrossed the divide to the head waters of the South Fork of Price River,\r\na tributary of Green River. It was a regret to me, in choosing this\r\nroute, that I should miss the familiar and beloved scenery of Weber and\r\nEcho cañons--the only part of the Union Pacific road which tempts one\r\nto look out of a car window, unless one may be tempted by the boundless\r\nmonotony of the plains or the chance of a prairie dog. Great was my\r\nsatisfaction, therefore, to find that this part of the new road,\r\nparallel with the Union Pacific, but a hundred miles farther south,\r\ntraverses the same belt of rocks, and exhibits them in forms not less\r\npicturesque. Castle Cañon, on the South Fork of the Price, is the\r\nequivalent of Echo Cañon, and is equal or superior in everything except\r\ncolor. The brilliant red of the Echo cliffs is wanting. The towers\r\nand walls of Castle Cañon are yellowish-gray. But their forms are\r\nincomparably various and grotesque--in some instances sublime. The\r\nvalley of Green River at this point is a cheerless sage-brush desert,\r\nas it is further north. To be sure, this uninviting stream, a couple of\r\nhundred miles further south, having united with the Grande, and formed\r\nthe Rio Colorado, does indeed, by dint of burrowing deeper and deeper\r\ninto the sunless chasms, become at last sublime. But here it gives no\r\nhint of its future somber glory. I remained awake till we had crossed\r\nGreen River, to make sure that no striking scenery should be missed by\r\nsleep. But I got nothing for my pains except the moonlight on the muddy\r\nwater; and next time I shall go to bed comfortably, proving to the\r\nconductor that I am a veteran and not a tender-foot.\r\n\r\nIn the morning, we breakfasted at Cimarron, having in the interval\r\npassed the foot-hills of the Roan Mountains, crossed the Grande, and\r\nascended for some distance the Gunnison, a tributary of the Grande, the\r\nUncompahgre, a tributary of the Gunnison, and finally a branch, flowing\r\nwestward, of the Uncompahgre. A high divide at the head of the latter\r\nwas laboriously surmounted; and then, one of our two engines shooting\r\nahead and piloting us, we slid speedily down to Cimarron. It is in such\r\ndescents that the unaccustomed traveler usually feels alarmed. But the\r\nexperience of the Rio Grande Railroad people is, that derailment is\r\nlikely to occur on up-grades, and almost never in going down.\r\n\r\nFrom this point, comparison with the Union Pacific line in the matter\r\nof scenery ceases. As everybody knows, that road crosses the Rocky\r\nMountains proper in a pass so wide and of such gradual ascent that the\r\nhigh summits are quite out of sight. If it were not for the monument to\r\nthe Ameses, there would be nothing to mark the highest point. For all\r\nthe wonderful scenery on the Rio Grande road, between Cimarron and\r\nPueblo, the Union Pacific in the same longitudes has nothing to show.\r\nFrom an artistic stand-point, one road has crossed the ranges at the\r\nmost tame and uninteresting point that could be found, and the other at\r\nthe most picturesque.\r\n\r\nAt Cimarron, the road again strikes the Gunnison, and plunges into the\r\nfamous Black Cañon. In length, variety, and certain elements of beauty,\r\nsuch as forest-ravines and waterfalls, this cañon surpasses the Royal\r\nGorge of the Arkansas. There is, however, one spot in the latter (I\r\nmean, of course, the point where the turbulent river fills the whole\r\nspace between walls 2,800 ft. high, and the railroad is hung over it)\r\nwhich is superior in desolate, overwhelming grandeur to anything on the\r\nGunnison. Take them all in all, it is difficult to say which is the\r\nfiner. I have usually found the opinion of travelers to favor the\r\nGunnison Cañon. But why need the question be solved at all? This one\r\nmatchless journey comprises them both; and he who was overwhelmed in the\r\nmorning by the one, holds his breath in the afternoon before the mighty\r\nprecipices of the other. To excuse myself from even hinting such folly\r\nas a comparison of scenery, I will merely remark that these two cañons\r\nare more capable of a comparison than different scenes usually are; for\r\nthey belong to the same type--deep cuts in crystalline rocks.\r\n\r\nBetween them come the Marshall Pass (nearly 11,000 ft. above sea-level),\r\nover the continental divide, and the Poncha Pass, over the Sangre di\r\nCristo range. This range contains Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Elbert,\r\nMassive (the peak opposite Leadville), and other summits exceeding the\r\naltitude of 14,000 ft. To the east of it is the valley of the Arkansas,\r\ninto which and down which we pass, and so through the Royal Gorge to\r\nCañon City and Pueblo, where we arrived before dark on the day after\r\nleaving Salt Lake.\r\n\r\nSalt Lake, the Jordan Valley, Utah Lake, the Wahsatch, Castle Cañon, the\r\nBlack Cañon of the Gunnison, Marshall Pass, Poncha Pass, the Arkansas\r\nValley, the Royal Gorge--what a catalogue for so brief a journey! No\r\nwonder everybody who has made it is \"wild about it!\" If enthusiastic\r\nurgency of recommendation from every passenger has any influence (and I\r\nknow it has a great deal), this road will continue to be, as it is at\r\npresent, crowded with tourists. It furnishes a delightful route for\r\nthose who wish on the overland journey to see Denver (as who does not?)\r\nand to visit Colorado Springs and Manitou. All this can be done _en\r\nroute_, without retracing the steps.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPHY APPLIED TO TERRA-COTTA AND OPAL GLASS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the natural course of things it must necessarily have occurred to\r\npractical men to utilize photography in the case of terra-cotta, as it\r\nhas already been employed in connection with so many other wares; but I\r\nhave not to this day known of its successful application to terra-cotta.\r\nNow this is strange, if one considers how fashionable _plaque_ and plate\r\npainting have become of late, and the good photographic results that\r\nare easily obtained on these as on sundry articles of this same \"burnt\r\nearth.\" Portraits, animals, landscapes, seascapes, and reproductions are\r\none and all easily transferred, whether for painting upon or to be left\r\npurely photographic. As a matter of business, too, one fails to see\r\nthat it would not be remunerative, but rather the contrary. It was with\r\nsomething of this feeling that I was led to try and see what could be\r\ndone to attain the end in view, and as I knew of no data to go by, I had\r\nto use my own experience, or rather experiment on my own account.\r\n\r\nSince emulsion was constantly at hand in my establishment, in the\r\ncommercial production of my gelatine dry plates, it was but natural I\r\nshould first have turned to this as a mode of obtaining the desired\r\nresults; but, alas! all attempts in that direction signally failed--the\r\nware most persistently refused to have anything to do with emulsion. The\r\nbugbear was the fixing agent or hypo., which not only left indelible\r\nmarks, but, despite any amount of washing, the image on a finished plate\r\nvanished to nothing at the end of an hour's exposure in the show window.\r\nThere was nothing left but to seek other means for the attainment of my\r\nobject. I would not have troubled the reader as to this unsuccessful\r\nline of experiment but that I wished to put him on his guard and save\r\nhim useless researches in the same direction. To cut matters short, the\r\nmethod I found best and most direct was the now old but still excellent\r\nwet collodion transfer. I will now proceed to detail my system of\r\nworking to facilitate the matter to the inexperienced in collodion\r\ntransfer.\r\n\r\n\r\nTERRA-COTTA PHOTOGRAPHY IN PRACTICE.\r\n\r\nThe first and indispensable operation, in the preparation of the surface\r\nto receive the transfer, is the \"sizing of the surface.\" It simply\r\nconsists of a solution of gelatine chrome-alumed, as follows:\r\n\r\n  Gelatine.                           10 grains.\r\n  Water.                               1 ounce.\r\n  A trace of chrome alum.\r\n\r\nCoat with a soft camel's hair brush and let dry. It is needless to say\r\nthat numbers of _plaques_, plates, vases, etc., may be coated right off,\r\nand will then be ready for use at any time.\r\n\r\nHaving settled on the subject and carefully dusted the negative, as well\r\nas placed it _in situ_ for reproduction, the next thing required is a\r\nsuitable collodion, and the following will be found all that can be\r\ndesired:\r\n\r\n  TRANSFER COLLODION.\r\n\r\n  Cotton.                      3 drachms.\r\n  Iodide of cadmium.          65 grains.\r\n  Ammonium iodide.            25   \"\r\n  Bromide of cadmium.         19   \"\r\n  Ammonium bromide.           11   \"\r\n  Alcohol.                    15 ounces.\r\n  Ether.                      15   \"\r\n\r\nThe plate thoroughly cleaned and coated with the collodion is now\r\ntransferred to a bath, as follows:\r\n\r\nNitrate of silver (common) 25 grains to the ounce.\r\n\r\nMade slightly acid with nitric acid.\r\n\r\nAfter sensitizing, the plate is exposed in the usual way and taken to\r\nthe room where pictures are ordinarily developed, and _quantum suff_. of\r\nthe following poured into the developing cup to bring out the image:\r\n\r\n  DEVELOPING SOLUTION.\r\n\r\n  A Winchester of water, i.e.  80 ounces.\r\n  Protosulphate of iron.      240 grains.\r\n  Citric acid.                240   \"\r\n\r\nOr the following may be used:\r\n\r\n  Pyro                          3 grains\\\r\n  Citric acid                   2   \"    } per ounce of water.\r\n  Glacial acetic acid          30 drops /\r\n\r\nAfter perfect development the picture is well washed and then fixed in a\r\nsaturated solution of hypo.; after which it is thoroughly washed.\r\n\r\nIt will now be found that the picture is not altogether satisfactory; it\r\nlacks both vigor and color. To improve matters recourse is now had to\r\n\r\n\r\nTONING.\r\n\r\n  Gold.    1 grain.\r\n  Water.   5 ounces.\r\n\r\nWith this a very fine depth is soon attained, and a nice picture the\r\nresult. Leave out the toning, and only a poor, sunken-looking picture\r\nwill be the outcome; but directly the toning bath is employed richness\r\nat once comes to the fore. I have, however, known of instances where the\r\npicture needed no toning.\r\n\r\n\r\nOPAL PRODUCTION IN PRACTICE.\r\n\r\nThis is still a secret with some in the profession. A limited number\r\nof workers have succeeded in bringing out good opals, and their _modus\r\noperandi_ is kept from the many. Now this is a pity, when one considers\r\nthe great charm attached to a good picture on opal, with pure whites and\r\nrich blacks, and in many localities the demand that might be created for\r\nthem. Apart from their beauty, another charm attaches to opals--their\r\nabsolute permanence; and this, it must be allowed, is no trifle. What,\r\nin fact, can be more painful to the worker who values his work, and sets\r\nstore by it, than to feel it must ere long fade and pass into oblivion!\r\nA properly executed opal will no more fade than the glass pictures so\r\ncommon at one time, and which, wherever taken care of, are as perfect\r\nnow as they were when first taken.\r\n\r\nNow, excellent pictures are to be made on opals by means of emulsion;\r\nbut I propose first taking the transfer method (mainly applicable to\r\nground opal and canvas) as given above for pottery, since in practice\r\nit is found very ready, easy of manipulation, and safe. The details are\r\nmuch the same as above, and necessitate double transfer.\r\n\r\nAfter the picture had been obtained on the plate (ordinary glass plate),\r\nand after thoroughly fixing, washing, and toning, the picture (and this,\r\nremember, is the case likewise with terra-cotta) then has to be loosened\r\nfrom its support, and this is done with a solution of sulphuric\r\nacid--one drachm to fifteen ounces of water--which is made to flow\r\nbetween the image and the glass, after which perfectly wash and mount.\r\nWhen the image is loosened a piece of tracing paper is put on the image,\r\nevened out, raised (assisted by some one else to hold the two opposite\r\ncorners during the operation), and with the aid of the helper the\r\npicture is carefully centered, gently pressed out or down, and the\r\ntransfer is so far effected. But what will happen, and does happen,\r\nin the case of vignettes, is impurity of the whites, when the picture\r\nbecomes positively objectionable. Now the way to remedy this lies simply\r\nin the application, to the dirty-looking parts, of a solution of iodine\r\ndissolved in iodide of potassium to sherry color; after which, well wash\r\nand apply a weak solution of cyanide of potassium, and wash well again.\r\nThis, by the way, is equally applicable to paper transfers; and it is\r\nto be remembered that the toning comes last of all. It is a rather\r\ndifficult matter to clean a ground opal which has been used two or three\r\ntimes, and acid must then be had recourse to (nitric acid is as good as\r\nany); but by transferring from the support on the ground surface, all\r\nstains are at once avoided.\r\n\r\nOn the flushed glass, or on the pot metal (unground), after well\r\ncleaning the surface it should be covered with a substratum of egg. Then\r\nthe picture is taken direct, not transferred; that is, the plate is\r\nexposed direct in the camera, regularly proceeded with, and, when dried,\r\nvarnished with a pale negative varnish, or with dead varnish if intended\r\nfor chalk or water-color. This, when a good negative is used, gives a\r\nremarkably fine picture, not requiring a vestige of retouching, and\r\nhaving likewise the invaluable advantage of being perfectly durable\r\nif varnished with the negative varnish. Moreover, on that, effective\r\npictures may be made in oil with simply tinting.\r\n\r\nA gentleman, who has a right to be considered a good judge in all art\r\nmatters, on looking at one of these pictures transferred on flushed\r\nglass, said it was one of the finest productions of photography. He\r\nurged that negatives _ad rem_ should be taken most carefully, and that,\r\nlike the picture I showed him, they should be full of half-tone and\r\ndetail, and yet have plenty of vigor. They should, he said, be robust in\r\nthe high lights, have perfectly clear glass in the few points of deep\r\nshadows, and thus have powerful relief. Moreover, the negatives should\r\nbe retouched only by a competent hand, and care taken that the likeness\r\nshall be in no way altered, which is so frequently the case now.\r\n\r\nIf done as thus suggested there is no doubt that remarkably fine\r\npictures are to be produced on opal, whether ground or not. Most\r\nartistic results are to be obtained, and, with proper care, absolute\r\npermanency. In this age of keen competition, all have to think of what\r\nmay be really recommended to one's _clientèle_, and likely to meet with\r\napprobation from strangers and friends when the picture has once been\r\ndelivered; and I candidly think that the opal, of all, is the picture\r\nmost likely to meet with this general approbation.\r\n\r\nI hope I have left it clearly to be understood that the class of opal\r\npicture to which I have chiefly alluded is one that remains untouched\r\nafter the transfer--that is, absolutely unpainted upon. It is pure\r\nphotography in every sense of the word, and the resultant picture one\r\nhardly to be surpassed in any way. I have rather laid a stress on this\r\npoint, well knowing how pictures are at times irretrievably ruined by\r\nthe barbarous hand of would-be artists, who by far exceed the true\r\nartists in number; and the hint on retouching should not be lost sight\r\nof, either, at a period when the tendency is to stereotype every one\r\nin marble-like texture, or rather lack of texture, as if the face were\r\ndevoid of all fleshiness and as hard and rigid as cast-iron. It might\r\nbe wise to weigh this point carefully, and act upon it, before the\r\nenlightened public have raised a cry against the pernicious practice\r\nand made photographers smart for their want of applying timely remedial\r\nmeasures to a decided evil.\r\n\r\nOn reading the above again, fearing lest any misconception should arise\r\nin the mind of the reader, I deem it expedient, to clearly state that\r\nfor terra-cotta recourse is had to double transfer; that is, the picture\r\nfirst taken is lifted from the support on tracing paper, put in\r\nthe right position on terra-cotta, and pressed down while wet with\r\nblotting-paper, left to dry, and is then so far ready.\r\n\r\nRespecting the production of pictures by means of emulsion, ground opal\r\nbeing the best, the system I employ is as follows: After well cleaning\r\nthe glass, coat it with emulsion (which had better not be too thick).\r\nWhen dry it is exposed and developed with the usual oxalate developer,\r\nto which a little bromide of potassium has been added. The remainder of\r\nthe operations is as usual. Those varnished with dead varnish can be\r\ntinted and worked up with colored crayons or black lead pencil and make\r\nvery pleasing pictures. It is needless to add that they are also to be\r\nfinished in water-colors if thought preferable.--_G. W. Martyn, in Br.\r\nJour.

Thiebaut is as follows: the paper has the\r\nfollowing advantages:\r\n\r\nFirst. The sensitive coating is regular, and its thickness is uniform\r\nthroughout the entire surface of each sheet.\r\n\r\nSecond. It can be exposed for a luminous impression in any kind of slide\r\nas usually constructed.\r\n\r\nThird. It can be developed and fixed as easily as a negative on glass.\r\n\r\nFourth. The negative obtained dries quite flat on blotting paper.\r\n\r\nFifth. The film which constitutes the negative can be detached or peeled\r\nfrom its support or backing easily and readily by the hand, without the\r\nassistance of any dissolving or other agent. Thus this invention does\r\naway with all sensitive preparations on glass, which latter is both a\r\nbrittle and relatively heavy material, thus diminishing the bulk and\r\nweight of amateur and scientific photographers' luggage when traveling;\r\nit produces photographic negatives as fine and as transparent as those\r\non glass, in so much that the film does not contain any grain; and,\r\nlastly, it admits of printing from either face of the film, as regards\r\nthe production of positives on paper or other material, as well as\r\nplates for phototypy and photo-engraving, which latter processes require\r\na negative to be reversed.\r\n\r\nFor the manufacture of my sensitized film paper:\r\n\r\nFirst. A gelatinized sheet of paper is properly damped with cold water,\r\nand when evenly saturated it is placed on a glass, to which it is\r\nattached by means of bands of paper pasted partially on the glass, and\r\npartially on the edges of the said sheet; in this state it is allowed to\r\ndry, whereby it is stretched quite flat.\r\n\r\nSecondly. I coat the dry sheet with a solution of ordinary collodion,\r\ncontaining from one to two per cent. cubic measure of azotic cotton (1½\r\nper cent. gives very good results) and from 1½ to 2½ per cent. of castor\r\noil (2 per cent. gives very good results); this coating is allowed to\r\ndry; and,\r\n\r\nThirdly. The glass, with the prepared paper upward, is leveled, and then\r\nit is coated, in a room from which all rays but red rays of light are\r\nexcluded, with a tepid emulsion of bromide of silver to the extent of\r\nabout one millimeter thick, and after leaving it in this position until\r\nthe gelatine has set (say) about five minutes, with the film paper still\r\nattached, it is placed upright in a drying-room, where it should remain\r\nabout twelve hours exposed to a temperature of from 62 to 66 degrees\r\nFahrenheit; and,\r\n\r\nFourthly. The film paper is detached from the glass ready for exposure,\r\ndevelopment, and fixing in the usual manner. For the purpose of\r\ndeveloping, oxalate of iron or pyrogallic acid answers equally well; for\r\nthe purpose of fixing, I have found that a mixture by weight, water,\r\n1,000, hyposulphite of soda 150, and powdered alum 60, produces\r\nexcellent results, after being allowed to dry.\r\n\r\nFifthly. The film is peeled off the paper by hand, and can be\r\nimmediately used for producing negatives _recto_ or _verso_ as above\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nI claim as my invention:\r\n\r\nFirst. The preparation or formation of gelatino-bromide film paper\r\nfor photographic negatives, in the manner and for the purposes above\r\ndescribed; and,\r\n\r\nSecondly. The use for this purpose of castor oil, or any other analogous\r\noil, more especially with the view of peeling off the film from the\r\npaper backing as above described.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME OF THE USES OF COMMON ALUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nA substance very much used by photographers of late years--in fact, so\r\nmuch used that no well-appointed laboratory could be considered complete\r\nwithout it--is the substance known is common alum, or potash alum, being\r\na double sulphate of alumina and potash; but it is interesting to note\r\nthat much of the commercial alum met with at the present time is ammonia\r\nalum, or the double sulphate of alum and ammonia. It is quite a matter\r\nof indifference to the photographer whether he uses potash alum or\r\nammonia alum.\r\n\r\nBesides its great value to the autotype, Woodburytype, and mechanical\r\nprinters as an agent for hardening the gelatine films, it has been\r\nrecommended for all sorts of ailments photographic. The silver printer\r\nadds a small portion to his sensitizing bath to keep it in working\r\norder, and to prevent blistering of the albumen; then, again, silver\r\nprints are soaked in a dilute solution of alum, having for its object\r\nthe thorough elimination of the last traces of the fixing salt. A very\r\ngood proportion to use for this latter purpose is four fluid ounces of a\r\nsaturated solution, diluted with one gallon of water, the prints being\r\nwell agitated during an immersion of ten minutes.\r\n\r\nOf all the uses to which alum is put, perhaps not in any single instance\r\ncan so much satisfaction be derived as when it is used to\r\narrest frilling of gelatine plates. This it has the power to do\r\ninstantaneously, and many of the most careful workers, both amateur and\r\nprofessional, or at least those who do net care to run any unnecessary\r\nrisks with negatives which have cost them a good deal of anxiety and\r\ntrouble to secure, but prefer to make assurance doubly sure--such\r\nindividuals may be numbered by the hundred--make it a point in every-day\r\npractice to immerse all their plates in a solution of alum, either\r\nbefore fixing, or immediately afterward. In fact, some operators have\r\ntwo alum baths in use, one a normal bath, as above mentioned, for\r\nimmersing the plates in when of the ordinary printing intensity; and the\r\nother a saturated solution strongly acidified by means of a vegetable\r\nacid (such as citric) or a mineral acid (such as sulphuric), for use\r\nwhen there is too much printing density, since it has been found\r\nin practice that an acid solution of alum in contact with sodium\r\nthio-sulphate on the gelatine image (after fixing, but before washing)\r\nnot only removes the color or stain caused by the alkaline or\r\npyrogallol, but perceptibly reduces the strength of the image. Moreover,\r\nthe color does not again reappear after washing, as it does sometimes\r\nwhen the fixing salt has been partially washed away. In cases where\r\nthere is great tendency to frill--such, for instance, as when a soft\r\nsample of gelatine has been employed, or old decomposed emulsion worked\r\nin with the fresh emulsion--it will in such cases be safer to put the\r\nplates in the normal-bath for a few minutes previous to immersing them\r\nin the acid bath.\r\n\r\nPotash alum is obtained tolerably pure in commerce in colorless\r\ntransparent crystalline masses, having an acid, sweetish, astringent\r\ntaste. It is soluble in 18 parts of water at 60° F., and in its own\r\nweight of water at 212° F.; but the excess crystallizes out upon\r\ncooling. The solution reddens litmus paper, and, when impure, usually\r\ncontains traces of oxide of iron. Upon the addition of either caustic\r\nsoda or potash, a white gelatinous precipitate is formed (hydrate of\r\nalumina), which is soluble in excess of the reagent employed. The\r\nprecipitate thus obtained has much of the character of the opalescent\r\nfilm sometimes observed on gelatine plates, when dry, which have been\r\nsoaked in alum, and not well washed afterward.\r\n\r\nAlkaline carbonates--such as washing soda, for instance--precipitate\r\nhydrate of alumina, which does not dissolve in an excess of the\r\nreagents, and carbon dioxide is evolved.\r\n\r\nAmmonia hydrate produces a precipitate in a much finer state of divison,\r\nwhich does not dissolve in excess when examined in a test-tube, it\r\nsomewhat resembles thin starch paste.\r\n\r\nThe presence of traces of iron may be known by adding a few drops of\r\nhydrochloric acid to a small quantity of a saturated solution of alum\r\nin a test-tube, to which add strong liquid ammonia; should any iron be\r\npresent, the mixture will have a reddish-brown tinge when examined over\r\na sheet of white paper. Other alums exist, such as the double sulphate\r\nof alumina and sodium, and sodium or aluminum and ammonium; but hitherto\r\ntheir uses have been confined to the experimental portion of the\r\ncommunity rather than the practical.--_Photo.

The effect is\r\nthat, together with the tension, although slight, and the drying, the\r\nweft partly shrinks and partly curls up, the latter, however, being\r\nscarcely observable to the naked eye. It may almost be said that as\r\nregards the width the shrinkage is due to a number of minute crumples\r\nbecause the cloth is easily streatched again by the fingers almost to\r\nits gray width. The main use of a stretching machine, therefore, is not\r\nso much to make the cloth more than it is as to bring it again to its\r\nnormal or woven width after operations that tend to shrinkage have been\r\nperformed upon it. The stretching operation, therefore, is especially\r\nuseful to calico printers, as it enables them to obtain when desired a\r\nwhite margin of even width, the irregularities due to bleaching being\r\ncorrected before printing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IMPROVED CLOTH STRETCHING MACHINE.]\r\n\r\nThe machine now illustrated is one we have recently seen in operation in\r\na Salford finishing works. It is an improved form of another stretching\r\nmachine which had been turned out in considerable numbers by Mr.\r\nArchibald Edmeston, engineer, of Salford, who makes a specialty of\r\ncalico printers' and finishers' machinery. The improvements consist\r\nmainly of a simplification of the working parts and thoroughly\r\nsubstantial construction of the machine. The principle adopted is a\r\nwell-known one. The selvages of the cloth, or more strictly the two\r\nedges of the cloth, of a width of about two inches, are caused to pass\r\nover and at the same time are held by the rims of two diverging pulleys.\r\nThe rims are further apart where the cloth leaves them than where they\r\nseize it, hence the stretching is gradually, certainly, and uniformly\r\nperformed. The cloth is gripped by the pressure of an endless belt\r\nacting against the lower half of each pulley, the edges being held\r\nbetween them. In the engraving these stretching pulleys are indicated by\r\nthe letters AA; the endless leather band passes over the pulleys, CC, of\r\nwhich there are a set of four provided for each stretching pulley. The\r\nlower pair of pulleys in each case may be tightened up by a screw\r\nfor the purpose of imparting the requisite tension to the bands. The\r\nstretching pulleys are mounted upon and driven by the same shaft, an\r\ningenious but simple swiveling joint in their bosses enabling them to\r\nbe set at any angle to the shaft and yet to revolve and be driven by it\r\nwithout throwing any undue strain upon the working parts. The piece,\r\nwound upon the ordinary batch shell, is placed upon the running-off\r\ncenter, D; it is led off over the rails, EE, and then downward to the\r\nnip of the bands and pulleys, AA. As explained, the selvages are here\r\ngripped between the bands and stretching pulleys, the rims of which are\r\nwider apart at the back than the front, and thus, in being conveyed\r\nunderneath, the piece is suitably stretched. Leaving the grip at the\r\nback it passes over leading-off rollers, FF, and the scrimp or opening\r\nrail, G, and thence downward to the winding-on center, which cannot be\r\nseen. The winding-on center is driven by friction. As the batch fills\r\nit and tends to wind faster than the machine delivers the cloth, the\r\ndriving slips. In addition to a capability of being set at an angle to\r\nthe shaft, the stretching pulleys, AA, may be slided upon, so as to\r\nseparate or bring them closer together, to allow for the treatment of\r\ndifferent widths of cloths. This adjustment is provided for by mounting\r\nthe stretching pulleys, AA, and the band pulleys, CC, etc., on frames,\r\nBB, the ends of which rest, as shown, upon rails, at the back and front\r\nof the machine. The adjustment either for width of piece or for the\r\nangularity (extent of stretching) is easily made by the hand-wheel, L.\r\nBy the bevel wheels shown, two cross screws having nuts connected to the\r\nends of frames, BB, are actuated in such a way that as desired the space\r\nbetween the back and front of the pulleys may be closed in or opened\r\nout, or the two wheels, maintaining the same angularity, may be\r\nseparated or closed in, either adjustment being expeditiously made. The\r\nwheels, HHH, are called center stretching wheels, the use of which is\r\nsometimes advantageous. They act in conjunction with a set of stretching\r\npulleys, of which one, K, may be seen in illustration. By a proper\r\nadjustment at the latter the piece is bent into a wavy form, where it\r\npasses between the whole of them, the effect of the corrugation being\r\nto loosen the center threads and to allow the piece to be more equally\r\nstretched with those near the selvages and more easily. This part of the\r\nmachine may be used or not as required. The production, we observe, was\r\nabout 120 yards per minute. The machine is solidly built and well fitted\r\ntogether, as was obvious to us from an inspection of some in course\r\nof construction at the maker's works. It is also claimed to be of\r\nconsiderable advantage to bleachers and finishers of white goods,\r\non account of the uniformity of the stretching causing but small\r\ndisturbance to the stiffening.--_Textile Manufacturer_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWOOLEN FABRICS PURIFIED BY HYDROCHLORIC ACID GAS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll known methods for chemically purifying woolen stuffs from vegetable\r\nfibers depend on the action of acids or substances of acid reaction.\r\nThe excessive temperature, hitherto unavoidable in the operation, acts\r\ninjuriously on the woolen fibers, especially during the formation of\r\nhydrochloric acid, with which process especially the development of an\r\ninjuriously high temperature has been hitherto unavoidable. The best\r\nmethod of absorbing the heat developed is in the evaporation of the\r\nmoisture naturally present in the wool. The patentees find agitation of\r\nthe fabric and the use of an exhauster during the process of material\r\nassistance. The operation maybe successfully performed in two\r\nways--either by acting on the fabric at the ordinary pressure with\r\nconstant agitation, or by saturation without agitation in a vacuum. For\r\nthe first method the patentees employ a wooden cylinder with an aperture\r\nat one end for inserting and removing the cloth, and having apertures\r\nall round to allow free access of air. This cylinder rests on a hollow\r\naxle, closed at one end and perforated with holes, through which the\r\nacid gas is passed. By the rotation of the cylinder the gas is drawn\r\nthrough the material and the latter exposed to the atmosphere, whereby\r\nit gives up a quantity of aqueous vapor. An average temperature of 30°\r\nCent. is best suited to the operation, and it can be regulated according\r\nto the supply of gas by opening or shutting a three-way cock between the\r\ngas generator and the revolving cylinder. This process is assisted by\r\nthe use of an exhauster of the usual construction. When fully saturated,\r\nthe fabric is allowed to remain until the vegetable fibers are\r\nsufficiently friable. The treatment _in vacuo_ is as follows:\r\n\r\nThe hydrochloric acid gas passes into a vessel of suitable material\r\nprovided with a perforated false bottom. From under this false bottom\r\na pipe connects with a second similar vessel connected itself with a\r\nvacuum pump having a let-off pipe. As soon as the maximum vacuum is\r\nattained, the gas is turned on through a three-way cock at a pressure of\r\n40 mm. mercury. The gas fills the first vessel and saturates the cloth.\r\nThe warmth set free (about 500 calories per kilo, gas) is taken up\r\nby the combined water in the wool, as, owing to the low pressure, a\r\nquantity of vapor is formed sufficient to take up the heat. This vapor\r\nstreams through the second vessel at a temperature of 35° Cent.,\r\npenetrates the material, and passes out through the pump. After\r\nsaturating the contents of the first vessel the gas passes into the\r\nsecond. AS soon as this is one-quarter or one-third saturated the first\r\nvessel is taken out and replaced by a third, which receives the overplus\r\nfrom No. 2 in like manner, and so on. This plan of working prevents gas\r\npassing through and damaging the pump. Instead of working under reduced\r\npressure, the desired low temperature can be maintained by passing\r\nalternately with the gas currents of air which absorb heat in\r\nevaporating the moisture of the material. The cloth, after saturation by\r\nthese processes, is left from six to twelve hours in the vessels, after\r\nwhich it is freely exposed to the air until the vegetable particles\r\nare friable. As soon as this occurs, the fabrics are washed. It is\r\nadvantageous to add to the wash water powdered carbonate of baryta,\r\nstrontia, magnesia, or preferably lime, and subsequently to rinse in\r\npure water. Phosphate of lime containing carbonate may also be employed\r\nfor neutralizing the acid, and the residue recovered and separated from\r\nthe organic residues mixed with it.--\"_H.

These gases perform the role of oxidizing or decolorizing agents.\r\n\r\nThe fibers that are immersed in the solution during the passage of the\r\nelectric current must necessarily remain therein for a greater or less\r\nlength of time, according to the nature of the material to be bleached,\r\nand must, after this first operation, be washed, rinsed, and dried.\r\n\r\nThe use of an electric current for decomposing the metallic chlorides\r\nand disengaging their elements is not new, and there have been specially\r\nutilized for this purpose, up to the present time, the alkaline\r\nhypochlorites that are obtained by well known processes.\r\n\r\nIn the latter case the metal is brought to the state of oxide in\r\npresence of the water that is necessary for the reaction. But the\r\nresults obtained in practicing this method are deceiving, as far as\r\nbleaching is concerned, and it is evidently more rational and economical\r\nto endeavor to compound the hypochlorite directly by borrowing all its\r\nelements from the metallic chloride itself, and from the water by means\r\nof which such transformation is to be effected. This is a reversal of\r\nthe problem, and, _à propos_ thereof, we would call the attention of\r\nthe reader to an apparatus invented by Messrs. Naudin & Schneider for\r\neffecting such synthesis in a simple and practical manner.\r\n\r\nIf a solution of chloride of sodium or kitchen salt, NaCl, be submitted\r\nto electrolysis in a hermetically closed vessel containing the material\r\nto be bleached, a formation of hypochlorite of soda is produced in the\r\nfollowing way:\r\n\r\n2NaCl + 2 H_{2}O = NaCl + NaO, ClO + 4H.\r\n\r\nIn operating in this manner we shall have the advantage that results\r\nfrom the nascent body through the electrical double decomposition of the\r\nchloride of sodium and water, which puts the chlorine, the metal, the\r\nhydrogen, and the oxygen simultaneously in presence. The chlorine and\r\noxygen will combine their action to decolorize the textile material.\r\n\r\nWhile starting from this idea, it will nevertheless be preferable to\r\nadopt Naudin & Schneider's arrangement.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus consists of a hermetically closed electrolyzer, A,\r\ninto the lower part of which enters the electrodes, E and F, of any\r\nelectrical machine whatever. The receptacle, A, is provided with a\r\nsafety-tube, T, that issues from its upper part and communicates with\r\na reservoir, B. A second tube, D, forms a communication between the\r\nelectrolyzer and the vessel, C. The liquid contained in this latter is\r\nsucked up by a pump, P, and forced to the lower part of the vessel, A,\r\nby means of the tubes, G and H.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus operates as follows:\r\n\r\nThe closed vessel, C, in which the material to be bleached is put, is\r\nfilled, as is also the electrolyzer, with a solution of chloride of\r\nsodium. This solution is then submitted to the action of an electric\r\ncurrent, when, as a consequence of the chemical decomposition of\r\nthe chloride and the water, the elements in a nascent state form\r\nhypochlorite of soda. When the partial or total conversion of the liquid\r\nhas been effected (this being ascertained by chlorometric tests), the\r\npump, P, is set rapidly in operation, and, as a consequence, draws up\r\nthe chloride of sodium from the bottom of the vessel, C, to the lower\r\npart of the electrolyzer, A. The hypochlorite that has formed passes\r\nthrough the tube, D (as a natural consequence of the elevation of the\r\nlevel of the liquid in A brought about by the entrance of a new supply\r\nof chloride), and distributes itself throughout the vessel, C, where it\r\nacts upon the textile material.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: APPARATUS FOR BLEACHING TEXTILE FIBERS BY ELECTRICITY.]\r\n\r\nThe safety-tube, T, which is attached to the electrolyzer, permits\r\nof the escape of the hydrogen which is produced during the chemical\r\nreaction, and fixes, through an alkaline solution contained in the\r\nreservoir, B, the chloride whose escape might discommode the operator.\r\n\r\nAs may be conceived, the slow transfer of the saline solution from\r\nthe receptacle, C, to the electrolyzer, and its rapid conversion into\r\ndecolorizing chloride, as well as its prompt application upon the\r\nmaterials to be bleached, presents important advantages.\r\n\r\nWhile, in the present state of the industries that make use of bleaching\r\nchlorides, the chloride of sodium is converted into hydrochloric acid,\r\nwhich, in order to disengage chlorine, must in its turn react upon\r\nbinoxide of manganese, we shall be able, with this new method, to\r\nutilize the chloride of sodium, which is derived from ordinary salt\r\nworks, and extract from it the constituent elements of the hypochlorite\r\nby a simple displacement of molecules produced under the influence of an\r\nelectric current.\r\n\r\nAnother and very serious advantage of electric bleaching is that of\r\nhaving constantly at hand a fresh solution of hypochlorite possessing a\r\nuniform decolorizing power, which may be regulated by the always known\r\nintensity of the current.\r\n\r\nWe must remark that the hypochlorites require a certain length of time\r\nto permit the chlorine to become disengaged, and that, besides, all\r\nchlorides, bromides, and iodides that are isomorphous are capable of\r\nundergoing an analogous chemical transformation and of being employed\r\nfor the same purpose. This is especially the case with the chlorides\r\nof potassium or barium, the bromides of strontium or calcium, and the\r\niodides of aluminum or magnesium. On another hand, as sea water contains\r\ndifferent chlorides, it results that it might serve directly as a raw\r\nmaterial for bleaching textile fibers. Then, when the solution of\r\nchloride of sodium has been deprived of its chlorine by electrolysis,\r\nthere remains a solution of caustic soda which may be utilized for\r\nscouring fibers.--_H. Danzer, in Le Génie Civil_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVED SPRING TRACTION ENGINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nMessrs. J. & H. McLaren, of the Midland Engine Works, Hunslet, Leeds,\r\nEngland, for several years past have devoted considerable attention to\r\nthe question of mounting traction engines on springs. The outcome of\r\nthis is the engine in question, the front end of which is carried by a\r\npair of Timmis spiral springs, resting on the center pin of the front\r\naxle, which is on Messrs. McLaren's principle, which enables it to\r\naccommodate itself to the inequalities of the road without throwing any\r\nundue strain on the front carriage. The chief difficulty hitherto has\r\nbeen to mount the hind end on springs without interfering with the spur\r\ngearing, which must be kept perfectly rigid to prevent breakage of the\r\ncogs. This is entirely provided for by the new arrangement, whereby all\r\nthe spring is allowed for in the spokes of the wheel itself, which will\r\nbe clearly seen on reference to the illustrations, in which Fig. 1 is a\r\nperspective view of the engine, while Fig. 2 shows a detail view of the\r\nwheel. The rim of the wheel is built up in the ordinary way of strong\r\nT-iron rings, with steel crossplates riveted on. The nave of the wheel\r\nhas wrought-iron ribs to which the spokes are bolted. These spokes are\r\nmade of the best spring steel, specially manufactured and rolled for the\r\npurpose, 9 inches wide and ½ inch thick. They are bent in a pear shape,\r\nwith the narrow ends fastened to the nave, and the crown resting upon\r\nthe rim of the wheel, where they are divided, and held in their places\r\nby means of clip fastened with bolts. When the weight of the engine\r\ncomes on these spokes, those nearest the ground are compressed and\r\nthose, at the top are elongated a little. In order to avoid any of the\r\ndriving strain passing through the springs, a strong arm is fixed on the\r\ndifferential wheel and attached to the rim as shown in Fig. 2, so that\r\nthe springs have really no work to do beyond carrying the weight of the\r\nengine. Messrs. McLaren naturally felt a certain amount of diffidence\r\nin placing their invention before the public until they had thoroughly\r\ntested it in practical work. This, we are informed, they have done, with\r\nthe most satisfactory results, during the last five or six months; and\r\nthey have a set of springs which ran during that time between 2,000 and\r\n3,000 miles, besides which there are several of these spring engines in\r\ndaily use.--_Iron_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG 1.

Among the recent improvements\r\ntending to perfect such mills, those which are shown in the iron frame\r\nstock gang, manufactured by Wickes Bros., East Saginaw, Mich., are\r\neminently valuable. Our large engraving represents one of these mills,\r\nconstructed to be driven by belt, friction, or direct engine, as may be\r\ndesired. The important requisite in this class of mills is such design\r\nand proportion of parts as will insure durability and continued movement\r\nat the highest speed, safely increasing the quantity and improving the\r\nquality of work done at a lesser feed, and admitting the use of thinner\r\nsaws than is practical in the slower moving sash. These are among the\r\nadvantages gained in the iron frame machine, overcoming the necessity\r\nof an expensive mill frame, saving time and expense in setting up, and\r\navoiding the liability of decay or change of position.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IMPROVED IRON FRAME GANG SAW MILL.]\r\n\r\nMany improvements have been made in the mechanism of oscillation, and\r\nfrom these the builders of this mill have adopted what is known as the\r\nWilkin movement, which oscillates the top and bottom slides. The top\r\nslides are pivoted at the top end, and the bottom ones from the bottom\r\nend, both being operated by one rock shaft from the center. This\r\nmovement when properly adjusted gives an easy clearance and the easiest\r\ncut yet obtained. It adds no extra weight to the sash, and avoids the\r\ncumbrous rock shaft and its attendant joints, usually weighing from\r\nthree hundred to five hundred pounds, which have been found so\r\nobjectionable in many other movements. The feed is continuous, and is\r\nmade variable from ¼ to 1¼ inch to each stroke, controllable by the\r\nsawyer. Power is applied to the press rolls in the double screw form\r\nwith pivot point, also operated by the same hand. A special feature of\r\nthis machine is the spreading of the lower frame so that its base rests\r\nupon an independent portion of the foundation from the main pillow block\r\nor crank shaft. The solidity of the whole structure is thus increased,\r\nboth by the increased width at the base and the prevention of connecting\r\nvibrations, which necessarily communicate when resting upon the same\r\npart, as in other forms of such machines heretofore in use.\r\n\r\nThe mill shown in the perspective view is one of twenty-six saws 4½ feet\r\nlong, sash 38 inches wide in the clear, and stroke 20 inches, capable\r\nof making 230 strokes per minute. The crank shaft is nine inches in\r\ndiameter, of the best forged iron. The main pillow block has a base\r\n6½ feet long by 21 inches bearing, weighing 2,800 pounds. The cap\r\nis secured by two forged bolts 3½ inches in diameter, and by this\r\narrangement no unequal strain upon the cap is possible. A disk crank is\r\nused with suitable counterbalance, expressly adapted to the weight and\r\nspeed of sash; a hammered steel wrist pin five inches in diameter, and a\r\nforged pitman of the most approved pattern, with best composition boxes.\r\nThe iron drive pulley is 4 to 4½ feet in diameter and 24 inches face;\r\nthe fly-wheel six feet in diameter, and weighing 4,700 pounds, turned\r\noff at rim. When a wider and heavier sash is required, a proportionate\r\nincrease is made in all these parts.\r\n\r\nIn the construction of the sash the stiles are made of steel; the lower\r\ngirt and upper heads are made in one solid piece, without rivets, giving\r\nthe greatest strength possible, with the least weight. The outfit also\r\nincludes eight iron rollers for the floor, 8½ inches in diameter, with\r\niron stands, and geared as live rolls when desired, a full set of\r\nLippencott's steel saw hangings, and gauges for one-inch lumber. The\r\nweight of the machine here shown is 18½ tons. They are, however, built\r\nin larger or smaller sizes, adapted to any locality, quality or quantity\r\nof work desired.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is said that the St. Gothard Tunnel is diverting the bulk of the\r\nItalian trade into the hands of the Belgians, Germans, and Hollanders\r\nwith startling rapidity. Without breaking bulk, early fruits are taken\r\nfrom all parts of Italy to Ostend, Antwerp, and Rotterdam, whence they\r\nare carried by fast steamers to London and other English ports. But, on\r\nthe other hand, Germany is sending into Italy large quantities of coal,\r\niron, machinery, copper, and other articles of which the latter received\r\nnothing before. In two months alone, the Italians imported 1,446 tons of\r\npaper.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HEAT REGENERATIVE SYSTEM OF FIRING GAS RETORTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe system of heat regeneration in the firing of gas retorts, in\r\naccordance with the principle which Dr. C.W. Siemens has worked out in\r\nsuch a variety of ways in the industrial arts, has lately been applied\r\nwith very marked success at the Dalmarnock Station of the Glasgow\r\nCorporation Gas Works. Notwithstanding the fact that a period of about\r\ntwenty years has elapsed since Dr. Siemens successfully adapted his\r\nsystem to the firing of retorts at the Paris Gas Works, it seems to have\r\nmade but little progress up to the present time; for what reasons it is\r\nperhaps difficult to explain. It is certain, however, that so-called\r\nregenerator furnaces of various forms have, from time to time, been\r\nbrought into use at gas works for the purpose in question both on the\r\nContinent and in this country; and in recent years the subject has\r\nreceived much attention from gas engineers, the general opinion\r\neventually being that the adoption of such a system of working would be\r\ncertain to result in so great an amount of economy as to put gas as an\r\nilluminating agent on a more secure footing to compete successfully with\r\nits modern and somewhat aggressive rival, the electric light. Of course,\r\nit is now admitted that the mode of adapting the heat regenerative\r\nprinciple at the Paris Gas Works was attended with a degree of\r\ncomplexity in the structural arrangements that was so great and so\r\nexpensive as to place it practically beyond the reach of gas companies\r\nand gas corporations generally, when the expense as well as the\r\nscientific beauty and practical efficiency of the new mode of applying\r\nand utilizing heat had to be considered. Fortunately, however, Dr.\r\nSiemens was enabled two or three years ago to demonstrate that there was\r\nno such thing as \"finality\" in that department of invention which he had\r\nmade almost exclusively his own. About the time mentioned he placed\r\nhis most advanced views on gas producers and on the regeneration and\r\nutilization of heat before the world, and within that period a most\r\ndecided step in advance has been made, the structural arrangements\r\nnow required for gas producers and regenerator furnaces having been\r\nimmensely simplified and cheapened, while their practical utility has in\r\nno way been interfered with.\r\n\r\nScarcely had Dr. Siemens announced his new form of gas producer and\r\nregenerator than communication was opened with him by Mr. W. Foulis, the\r\ngeneral manager to the Glasgow Corporation Gas Trust, with the view of\r\nentering into arrangements for its adoption on an experimental scale\r\nat one of the stations under his charge. Encouraged by the hearty\r\nco-operation of the gas committee, two or three of whose members were\r\nwell known engineers, Mr. Foulis very soon came to an understanding with\r\nDr. Siemens to have the regenerative system put to a thorough test at\r\nthe Dalmarnock Gas Works, situated in the extreme east end of the city,\r\nand the largest establishment of the kind in Scotland, the total number\r\nof retorts erected being about 750. The system in its most recent shape\r\nwas applied to four ovens, each of which had seven retorts, but which\r\nnumber has since been increased to eight, owing to the space occupied\r\nby the furnace in the ordinary settings being rendered available for\r\nan additional retort in the new or \"Siemens\" setting. For each oven or\r\nchamber of eight retorts there was erected a separate gas-producer,\r\nso that even one set of eight retorts might alone be used if thought\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GAS RETORTS WITH REGENERATIVE FURNACES .--GLASGOW\r\nCORPORATION GAS WORKS.]\r\n\r\nIn Figs. 1 and 2 of our illustrations, the general arrangement and the\r\nrelationship of the gas producer, the regenerators, and the retorts to\r\neach other are clearly shown. It was a sort of _sine qua non_ of the new\r\nmethod of firing the retorts that the producer should be in as close\r\nproximity as possible to the place where the gaseous fuel was to be\r\nused, and it was concluded that the most convenient situation would be\r\nimmediately in front of its own set of eight retorts, and with its top\r\non a level with the working floor of the retort house. To place it\r\nin such a position meant a good deal of excavation, which was also\r\nrequired, however, for the regenerator flues. The excavation was carried\r\ndown to a depth of 10 ft. below the level of the retort house floor, and\r\nas a matter of course the operation of underpinning had to be resorted\r\nto for the purpose of carrying down the foundations of the division\r\nwalls, which, together with the main arches and the hydraulic main, were\r\nin no way otherwise disturbed. As in most new inventions, a good deal\r\nof difficulty was experienced at first in connection with these gas\r\nproducers and heat regenerator furnaces; but by dint of application and\r\nby the adoption of modifications made here and there in the arrangements\r\nfrom time to time, as also by a determination not to be beaten, although\r\noften disheartened, Mr. Foulis was ultimately rewarded with complete\r\nsuccess. The new system of firing being made so simple that there was\r\nscarcely any possibility of failure likely to arise in ordinary practice\r\nif it was superintended with but a moderate amount of care.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 3._]\r\n\r\nThe results which were obtained in course of time with four ovens, or a\r\ntotal of 32 retorts, were so exceedingly promising that it was forthwith\r\nresolved to extend the new mode of firing to the whole of a double bench\r\nof twelve ovens, now containing 96 retorts; and all the improvements\r\nwhich had suggested themselves during the working experiments with the\r\nfour ovens were adopted from the first in the reconstruction of the\r\nremaining eight ovens in the bench. More recently the regenerator system\r\nhas been applied to other 22 ovens, or 176 additional retorts, being the\r\nwhole of one of the main divisions of the retort house; and during the\r\nvery depth of the present winter, when the demand for gas was at its\r\ngreatest height, all the retorts of the converted or \"Siemens\" settings,\r\namounting to 272, were in full working activity, in which condition they\r\nstill remain. It is intended to make another very considerable extension\r\nof the heat regenerative system of firing during the ensuing spring and\r\nsummer. The reconstruction of the present year will extend to the ovens\r\nof seven retorts each, giving in this case eighty gas fired retorts; and\r\nto twenty ovens of five retorts each, which will become sixteen ovens,\r\neach having eight retorts, making 128 retorts in this division, and the\r\ntotal being 208 retorts in place of 170 in the same amount of space. It\r\nis confidently anticipated, therefore, that by the month of August of\r\nthe present year, 480 full sized retorts will be available for working\r\nout the new method at the Dalmarnock Gas Works. Furthermore, the\r\nconfidence which has been inspired in the minds of the members of the\r\nGlasgow Corporation Gas Committee and their engineer regarding the\r\nactualities and possibilities of the Siemens system of firing gas\r\nretorts, in its most improved state, is such that arrangements are\r\nbeing made for starting shortly to apply it throughout at the Dawsholm\r\nStation, which is situated in the suburban burgh of Maryhill, and some\r\nfour or five miles distant from the Dalmarnock Works in a northwestern\r\ndirection. The station just named, which is also a very large one, will\r\nprobably require two years for its conversion.\r\n\r\nWe shall now give some account of the structural arrangements adopted\r\nfor producing cheap gaseous fuel, and for turning that fuel to the\r\ngreatest advantage in firing the retorts for the purpose of carbonizing\r\nthe cannel coal used as the source of the gas.\r\n\r\nThe gas producer, which is represented in vertical section in Fig. 2, is\r\na cylinder of brickwork inclosed in a casing of malleable iron. It is 7\r\nft. 6 in. deep, and 3 ft. in diameter, which becomes reduced to 20\r\nin. above, where it is closed by means of a cast-iron lid, which is\r\ncontinuous with the floor of the retort house. There are no firebars\r\nat the bottom, so that the fuel rests on a floor of firebrick. At the\r\nbottom of the walls of the producer there are several holes about 1 ft.\r\nin length by 6 in. in height. By means of these openings any clinker\r\nthat may form and the ashes of the spent fuel can readily be withdrawn.\r\nThey also allow of the admission of air to maintain the combustion in\r\nthe lower portion of the mass of fuel; and at each opening there is a\r\nmalleable iron tube for delivering a jet of steam direct from a steam\r\nboiler. We shall subsequently explain the functions performed by the\r\nsteam.\r\n\r\nThe fuel employed is the coke or char resulting from cannel coal when it\r\nhas yielded up its hydrocarbons and other gases during the process of\r\ncarbonization in the gas retorts. Being entirely made from Scotch cannel\r\nthe coke is very poor in quality, as it contains a large percentage of\r\nmineral matter or ash relatively to its fixed carbon. The retorts are\r\nworked with three-hour charges, but the producer is only charged once in\r\nevery six hours For each set of eight retorts the charge of raw cannel\r\nis about 18 cwt., and it is found in practice that the coke drawn from\r\nfive of the retorts is quite sufficient to fill up the producer to the\r\ntop. Formerly a set of seven retorts fired in the ordinary way from a\r\nfurnace underneath, required from 60 to 75 per cent. of the coke made,\r\nbut now, with eight retorts in each oven, the quantity has been reduced\r\nto about 30 per cent., or less than one-half of what it formerly was.\r\nBefore the retorts are drawn the lid is removed from the top of the\r\nproducer, and any fuel still remaining unconsumed is touched up a bit by\r\nway of leveling it on the surface, and as soon as it has been filled up\r\nto the constricted portion a shovelful of soft luting is spread over the\r\ntop of the coke, and the lid is laid upon it and driven home, thereby\r\nmaking a perfectly air-tight joint. The contents of the other three\r\nretorts, as also the contents of the whole of the retorts at each\r\nalternate drawing, are taken to the coke heap in the yard. We have\r\nalready spoken of a charge of cannel as being about 18 cwt. for each set\r\nof eight retorts, but in connection with that matter we should mention\r\nthat it was formerly about 13 cwt. per oven containing seven retorts,\r\nand that there is every prospect of it being increased without\r\nincreasing the length of time occupied in carbonizing the cannel of each\r\ncharge.\r\n\r\nIt may be worth while now to notice briefly what takes place among the\r\nmass of coke in the gas producer. The atmospheric air admitted at the\r\nseveral openings previously spoken of ascends through the lower layers\r\nof the incandescent coke, the carbon of which burns to carbonic acid\r\ngas at the expense of the oxygen of the air. Among the middle and upper\r\nlayers of the incandescent coke the carbonic acid gas takes up a further\r\nquantity of the fixed carbon, and becomes transformed into carbonic\r\noxide gas (CO_{2}+C=2CO), which is an inflammable body, and possesses\r\nconsiderable calorific power. Unless the carbonic acid gas is very\r\ncompletely \"baffled\" in its ascent through the coke in the producer, a\r\nquantity of it passes into the furnace along with the carbonic oxide,\r\nthe efficiency of which is diminished in proportion as the former\r\nincreases in quantity. Of course, also, the nitrogen associated with\r\nthe oxygen in the air admitted to the gas generator passes on with the\r\ncarbonic oxide gas, this nitrogen acting as a dilutant and being of\r\ncourse absolutely useless as a generator of heat. The steam which\r\nwe previously spoke of serves two good purposes. In contact with\r\nincandescent coke it suffers decomposition, its oxygen uniting with some\r\nof the fixed carbon to form carbonic oxide, while the hydrogen which\r\nis set free passes onward, and mixes with the other gases to be\r\nsubsequently consumed with them. The admission of the steam thus causes\r\nthe absorption of heat in the gas generator where the decomposition\r\ntakes place, this heat being again evolved on the subsequent combustion\r\nof the hydrogen. Then, again, as the steam is delivered in among the\r\ncoke in a jet, or a series of jets, it has the effect of almost entirely\r\npreventing any clinkering or slagging of the earthy and silicious\r\nmaterials, which form such a large portion of the substance of the coke\r\nobtained from Scotch cannels, sometimes as much as from 15 to 20 per\r\ncent. It is scarcely necessary for the stokers to go down below to the\r\nbottom of the producers to remove the ash above once in every six hours.\r\nReferring to the composition of the gaseous fuel obtained from cannel\r\ncoke in one of these gas producers, we give the following typical\r\nanalysis on the authority of Dr. William Wallace, F.R.S.E., gas\r\nexaminer, and one of the public analysts for the city of Glasgow:\r\n\r\n                     Per cent.\r\n  Hydrogen             8.7\r\n  Carbonic oxide      28.1\r\n  Carbonic acid        3.5\r\n  Oxygen               0.4\r\n  Nitrogen            59.3\r\n                     -----\r\n                     100.0\r\n\r\nBy again referring to Fig. 2, it will be observed that an opening is\r\nprovided for the passage of the gaseous matter as it is formed into the\r\nmass of brickwork, the upper half of which is occupied by the retorts of\r\nthe setting and the lower by the regenerators.\r\n\r\nBefore following the gas we may first direct attention to the\r\narrangements for dealing with it, and with the air that has to be\r\nadmitted for the combustion of so much of it as is of a combustible\r\nnature. It will be seen by reference to Fig. 1 that the oven proper is\r\noccupied by eight [Inline Illustration] shaped retorts. These are 9 ft.\r\nlong (set back to back) by 18 in. by 13 in., and they are placed on\r\narches which are 8 ft. 6 in. wide. Underneath the level of the retort\r\noven there are two regenerators or regenerator chambers, which differ\r\nvery materially in form from the regenerators formerly applied by Dr.\r\nSiemens to gas retort ovens, and which are still employed for high\r\ntemperature furnaces like those used for steel and glass melting. In\r\nthe case of these latter the regenerators are on the alternating\r\nsystem--that is to say, a mass of brickwork is heated by the waste heat\r\nof the effluent gases, and when that is made sufficiently hot, the\r\ncurrent of waste gases is turned into a second mass of brickwork, while\r\nair is admitted to pass through the brickwork already heated. The system\r\nthus briefly described entails a certain amount of attention on the part\r\nof the workmen in the altering of the valves or dampers to reverse the\r\ncurrents. The regenerator now adopted consists of an arrangement of six\r\nzigzag flues, three on each side of the setting. These flues run the\r\nwhole length of the setting. As indicated by the arrows pointing\r\ndownward in Fig. 3, the waste gases on their way to the chimney stack\r\npass to and fro through the side flues, thus giving up a large portion\r\nof their contained heat by the process of conduction or contact to the\r\ncentral flue through which the incoming air passes. The air necessary\r\nfor combustion is first admitted into a large chamber in the center, and\r\nthen it is divided into two currents, which pass right and left into the\r\ncentral passages of the two regenerators. As the air flue is at a very\r\nbright heat for a considerable distance before the air leaves it, the\r\ntemperature of the air must be equally great, or nearly so. In its most\r\nimproved form one of these heat regenerative furnaces provides an amount\r\nof heating surface extending to 234 square ft., which is exposed to the\r\nair on its way to the combustion chamber.\r\n\r\nPassing from the producer through the flue provided for it, the gas\r\nenters the retort setting underneath the side retorts, where it meets\r\nthe air coming from the regenerator. It enters the setting, not by a\r\nnumber of small openings, but by one large opening on each side, and\r\nmeets the air entering also by a large opening, the effect of which is\r\nto avoid the localization of intense heat, as all the retorts of the\r\nsetting become enveloped in an intensely heating flame, due to the\r\ncombustion of the carbonic oxide and hydrogen gases.\r\n\r\nThere are various advantages attending this system of firing gas\r\nretorts. First of all, there is already a saving of fuel to the extent\r\nof one-half, and not unlikely there will soon be a further very decided\r\nincrease in the saving of fuel to record, inasmuch as it has been\r\nexperimentally determined within the past two or three weeks that, by\r\nincreasing its diameter to 3 ft. 4 in., one producer can be made to\r\nprovide a sufficient amount of gaseous fuel to fire two sets of eight\r\nretorts. By the arrangement just hinted at the relative amount of fuel\r\nused will be still further reduced. Then, again, an additional retort\r\ncan well be placed in each oven, as it occupies the position of the fire\r\nin ordinary settings. In the third place, by the greater heat which is\r\nobtained, the charges can be more rapidly distilled; or heavier charges\r\ncan be carbonized in a given space of time. When all the gains are put\r\ntogether, the amount of coal carbonized is increased by about 40 per\r\ncent. over any specified time. Of course, in the new or regenerator\r\nsettings there is much greater regularity of heat; and as the gaseous\r\nfuel is perfectly free from all solid matter, and burns without any\r\ntrace of smoke, there is a total absence of deposit on the outside of\r\nthe retorts. From these two circumstances combined it is but natural to\r\nexpect that there should be greater durability of the retorts--which\r\nis really the case. Another advantage is that, as the fuel used in\r\nthe furnaces is wholly gaseous, choking of the flues cannot by any\r\npossibility arise. It is the confident opinion of Mr. Foulis that the\r\nsystem in question can be applied with advantage to all sizes of gas\r\nworks, and that it is certainly well adapted for all works where the\r\nsummer consumption of gas is sufficiently large to give employment to\r\neight retorts.\r\n\r\nAs this is the first instance of the new form of gas producer and\r\nregenerator having been adopted in any gas works, a very great amount\r\nof scientific and practical interest attaches to it. Many persons have\r\nvisited the Dalmarnock Gas Works during their reconstruction, in order\r\nto see the system in operation, and doubtless many more will go and do\r\nlikewise when they learn of the numerous advantages which it possesses,\r\nand which are likely to increase rather than diminish.--_Engineering_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA NEW GAS-HEATED BAKER'S OVEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the past few weeks, a highly interesting experiment--and one,\r\nmoreover, destined to materially influence the development of the uses\r\nof gas in a fresh field--has been in progress, under the guidance of Mr.\r\nBooer, at a baker's shop in the Blackfriars Road, London. The experiment\r\nin question is nothing less than the application of gas for heating\r\nbakers' ovens, in a manner not hitherto attempted, and such as to bring\r\nthe system within the means of the poorest tradesman in all but the\r\nsmallest towns. It will be remembered that the success of the gas-heated\r\nmuffles for burning tiles and glass led to the attempted construction of\r\na model baker's oven, heated by the same fuel, which was shown in action\r\nat the Smoke Abatement Exhibition at South Kensington in the winter\r\nof 1881-82. This model attained considerable success; but its design\r\ndemanded either a new structure in every case, or considerable\r\nalteration of any existing oven. In the proposed system, moreover,\r\nthe oven was heated wholly from without--a condition supposed to be\r\nnecessary to meet the objections of the bakers. It is evident, however,\r\nthat there must be considerable waste of gas in heating a mass of tiles\r\nand brickwork, such as go to the construction of a common baker's oven,\r\nfrom the outside; and the objection to handicapping such a costly fuel\r\nas gas in this manner becomes more apparent when it is remembered that\r\nin the usual way the oven is always heated by an internal coal fire.\r\nWhen it is further considered that the coal commonly used by bakers is\r\nof the most ordinary quality, full of dirt that would condemn it in the\r\nestimation of a gas manager, the sentimental objection to allowing a\r\npurified gas flame to burn in a place which this rubbish is permitted to\r\nfill with foul smoke becomes supremely ridiculous. Consequently, when\r\nMr. Booer, whose work in connection with the gas muffle is well known\r\nin England and America, seriously addressed himself to construct, upon\r\naltogether new lines, a cheap and practical baker's oven, he wisely put\r\nthe gas inside.\r\n\r\nThere are many other conditions which Mr. Booer, after consultation with\r\npractical bakers and others, set himself to fulfill, the observance\r\nof which lends to the present Blackfriars experiment much of its\r\ninteresting character. Thus it was observed that, while it is not\r\ndifficult to build an oven in a given spot, and bake bread in it, this\r\ncannot truly be called a _baker's_ oven. By this term must be understood\r\nin particular an oven in an ordinary bakehouse, set in the usual style\r\nand worked by a man with his living to get by it. Before the problem of\r\nextending gas to bakers' ovens could be considered solved, it had to be\r\nattacked from this aspect. Mr. Booer, to do him full credit, seems to\r\nhave early appreciated this fact in all its bearings. He not only saw\r\nthat it was necessary to save gas, as much as possible, by putting it\r\ninside the oven; but he was told that, in order to meet with any general\r\nsuccess, the cost of converting an oven to the gas system must be\r\nrigidly kept down to about ten or twelve guineas. The latter seems\r\na particularly hard condition, when it is remembered that the only\r\nimproved baker's oven in practical use at the present day is the steam\r\noven invented by Mr. Perkins, which costs two or three hundred pounds to\r\nerect. Mr. Booer also had in mind the necessity that everything possible\r\nfor a coal oven must likewise be performed by a gas oven; and in this\r\nrespect he set himself to surpass the costly Perkins oven, which will\r\nnot bake the common \"batch\" or household bread, generally the principal\r\narticle of sale, more especially in populous and poor neighborhoods. The\r\npeculiar efficacy of the common coal fire in this respect proceeds from\r\nthe essential principle of action of a brick oven, which is found simply\r\nin the fact that the work is done entirely by heat previously imparted\r\nto the tile bottom, roof, and sides of the oven, and thence radiated to\r\nthe bread. No other kind of heat will bake batch-bread--i.e., loaves\r\npacked in contact with one another--which requires to be thoroughly\r\nsoaked by a radiant heat in a close atmosphere of its own steam. Now,\r\nas a coal fire is eminently qualified to impart, by radiation and\r\notherwise, this necessary store of heat to the brickwork, it is plainly\r\na difficulty to effect the same purpose with a fuel which, of\r\nitself, can scarcely radiate heat at all. The system of the gas\r\ncooking-oven--the utilization of the heat of the combustion products as\r\nformed--is clearly inapplicable here; for a different kind of heat is\r\nneeded, under conditions that would not sustain continuous combustion.\r\nTherefore, there is nothing for it but to heat the bottom and sides\r\nof the brick oven by the direct contact of powerful gas-flames; thus\r\nsupplanting the coal fire, but leaving the actual work of baking to be\r\ndone afterward by stored-up heat in the regular way.\r\n\r\nHaving settled the general principles of a system of this kind, there\r\nstill remain a number of scarcely less important details, in the dealing\r\nwith which lies the difference between practical success and failure.\r\nThus it is not merely sufficient to heat an oven for bread baking; it is\r\nalso necessary to heat it within the times and according to the habits\r\nof work to which the baker has been accustomed. Work in town bakeries\r\nbegins at about midnight, or shortly after, and the condition of the\r\noven must conform to the requirements of the dough, which vary from day\r\nto day and from season to season. In order to master all these niceties,\r\nas far as a knowledge of them is necessary to his purpose, Mr. Booer\r\nhas spent many nights in the bakehouse in the Blackfriars Road; and has\r\nthereby obtained a command over the technicalities of the work which has\r\nserved him in good stead, not merely for adjusting his gas heat, but in\r\nanswering the innumerable objections always raised when a revolution in\r\nan immemorial trade is threatened. It is with considerable satisfaction\r\nthat we are enabled to declare, after duly weighing all the conditions\r\nas to first cost and otherwise imposed by himself and others, that Mr.\r\nBooer has succeeded, upon these terms, in vindicating the claims of gas\r\nto be a cheap, efficient, and cleanly fuel for heating ovens under the\r\ncontrol and according to the methods of working of the baker himself.\r\n\r\nThe oven with which this success has been achieved is one of two in the\r\nbakehouse of Mr. Loeber, of 161 Blackfriars Road. It measures 7 feet by\r\n6 feet internally; being what is technically termed a 6 bushel oven. The\r\nalterations made by Mr. Booer consist in the first place in the removal\r\nof the flooring tiles, and the laying down of a new bottom, under which\r\nrun a number of flues radiating from the side furnace. The throat of the\r\nfurnace, where it enters the angle of the oven, is bricked up, and eight\r\npieces of ¾-inch gun-barrel tubing project above this dwarf wall,\r\nand radiate fan-shaped under the dome of the roof. These are the\r\ngas-burners, which are supplied from a 1½-inch pipe led into the old\r\nfurnace. The same pipe supplies the similar burners which are inserted\r\nin the flues under the oven bottom. This is really all the plant\r\nrequired. It should be remarked that these bottom flues are carried to\r\ndifferent points of the side walls, and the products of combustion are\r\nallowed to rise upward into the oven through gaps left for the purpose.\r\nA supplementary supply of heated air is provided to help the combustion\r\nof the gas in these flues, which would otherwise be languid. When the\r\ngas is turned on from the main cock in the furnace either to the top or\r\nthe bottom set of burners, a long match is used to light them from\r\nthe same point. This is effected without risk of firing back, by the\r\nadoption of a specially constructed atmospheric nipple and shield, the\r\npattern of which is registered. The flame from the top burners unites in\r\na sheet of fire, which spreads out all over the crown of the oven, at\r\nthe same time that the burners below are doing their work, and the\r\nproducts of combustion flow together through the oven to the chimney,\r\nwhich is the same that was used for coal. At first, as might be\r\nexpected, there was considerable difficulty in finding the most suitable\r\nposition of the chimney damper, aggravated in this case by the fact that\r\nthe other oven worked with a coal fire into the same shaft. Finally,\r\nhowever, the two flues were disconnected with the happiest results.\r\nDuring the past fortnight the oven has been in regular use, and the\r\nbread has been sold over the counter in the ordinary course of trade.\r\nTwo and three batches of bread have been baked in one day in this oven;\r\nthe economy of its use, of course, increasing with the number of loaves\r\nturned out. As a rule the gas is lighted for about an hour before the\r\noven is wanted, and about 250 cubic feet are used. Then the cocks are\r\nshut and the oven is allowed to stand closed up for ten minutes, in\r\nwhich time it ventilates itself, and the heat spreads over it. Then the\r\nbatch is set, and the baking occupies from an hour to an hour and a\r\nhalf, according to the different classes of loaves. Two batches are\r\nbaked with a consumption of about 620 cubic feet of gas; costing, at 2s.\r\n10d. per 1000 cubic feet, just 11d. each batch for fuel. This cannot be\r\nconsidered costly. But the system possesses many other advantages. In\r\nthe first place, it is much more cleanly than coal; for the oven never\r\nrequires wiping out, which is usually done with a bundle of old rope\r\ncalled a \"scuffle\" and the operation is attended with a most unpleasant\r\nodor. Then there is no smoke--a great advantage from the point of\r\nview of the Smoke Abatement Institution. More to the purpose of the\r\njourneyman baker, however, is the fact that there is no stoking to be\r\ndone, and he can therefore take his repose at night without having to\r\nattend to the furnace. Besides this the master has the satisfaction of\r\nknowing that the oven will always be hot enough if he simply attends to\r\nthe time of lighting the gas--a consideration of no small moment. It is\r\nno mean testimony to the reality of Mr. Booer's success that Mr. Loeber,\r\nhaving seen his difficulties and troubles from the beginning, and marked\r\nhow they have been overcome, is content to acknowledge that even this\r\nfirst example is capable of turning out bread in a condition to be sold\r\nover the counter. There is a good opening in this direction, for there\r\nare 6,000 bakeries in London alone, to every one of which Mr. Booer's\r\nsystem might be applied with advantage to the tradesman and his\r\ncustomers. And what may be done with gas at about 3s. per 1,000 cubic\r\nfeet may certainly be done to still greater advantage in many towns\r\nwhere the price is lower. Mr. Booer has entered upon his work in a\r\nproper spirit. He has begun at the beginning, with the necessities of\r\nthe baker; and has gone plodding on quietly, until he has achieved a\r\nnoteworthy success. It may be hoped he will receive the reward which his\r\nperseverance merits.--_Jour. of Gas Lighting_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN MATTHEW WEBB.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho was drowned on July 24 in attempting to swim through the whirlpool\r\nand rapids at the foot of the Falls of Niagara, was born at Irongate,\r\nnear Dawley, in Shropshire, January 18, 1848. He was 5 feet 8 inches in\r\nheight, measured 43 inches round the chest, and weighed about 14½ stone.\r\nHe learnt to swim when about seven years old, and was trained as a\r\nsailor on board the Conway training-ship in the Mersey, where he saved\r\nthe life of a fellow seaman. In 1870 he dived under his ship in the Suez\r\nCanal and cleared a foul hawser; and, on April 23, 1873, when serving on\r\nboard the Cunard steamer Russia, he jumped overboard to save the life of\r\na hand who had fallen from aloft, but failed, and it was an hour before\r\nhe was picked up almost exhausted. For this he received a gold and\r\nother medals. He became captain of a merchant ship, but soon after he\r\nrelinquished the sea and devoted himself to the sport of swimming.\r\n\r\nAt long distance swimming in salt water he was _facile princeps_, but he\r\ndid not show to such advantage in fresh water. In June, 1874, he swam\r\nfrom Dover to the North-East Varne Buoy, a distance of 11 statute miles.\r\nOn July 3, 1875, he swam from Blackwall Pier to Gravesend Town Pier,\r\nnearly 18 statute miles, in 4 hours 52 minutes. On the 19th of the same\r\nmonth he swam from Dover to Ramsgate, 19¼ statute miles, in 8 hours 45\r\nminutes. On August 12, 1875, he tried to cross from England to France,\r\nand although he failed, owing to the heavy sea, he compassed the\r\ndistance from Dover to the South Sand Head, 15½ statute miles, in 6\r\nhours 48 minutes. On the 24th of the same month he made another attempt,\r\nwhich rendered his name famous all over the English-speaking world.\r\nStarting from Dover, he reached the French coast at Calais, after being\r\nimmersed in the water for 21 hours 44 minutes. He had swum over 39\r\nmiles, or, according to another calculation, 45½ miles, without having\r\ntouched a boat or artificial support of any kind. Subsequently he swam\r\nat the Lambeth Baths, and the Westminster Aquarium, and last year, at\r\nBoston, U.S., he remained in a tank nearly 128½ hours. Latterly he had\r\nsuffered from congestion of the lungs, and his health had become much\r\nimpaired.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CAPT. MATTHEW WEBB.]\r\n\r\nThe story of his final and fatal effort needs here but a brief\r\ndescription. At two minutes past four, on July 24, Webb dived from the\r\nboat opposite the Maid of the Mist landing, and, amid the shouts and\r\napplause of the crowd, struck the water. He swam leisurely down the\r\nriver, but made good progress. He passed along the rapids at a great\r\npace, and six minutes after making the first plunge passed under the\r\nSuspension Bridge. Immediately below the bridge the river becomes\r\nexceedingly violent, and as the water was clear every movement of Webb\r\ncould be seen. At one moment he was lifted high on the crest of a wave,\r\nand the next he sank into the awful hollow created. As the river became\r\nnarrower, and still more impetuous, Webb would sometimes be struck by a\r\nwave, and for a few moments would sink out of sight. He, however, rose\r\nto the surface without apparent effort. But his speed momentarily\r\nincreased, and he was hurried along at a frightful pace. At length he\r\nwas swept into the neck of the whirlpool. Rising on the crest of the\r\nhighest wave, he lifted his hands once, and then was precipitated into\r\nthe yawning gulf. For one moment his head appeared above the angry\r\nwaters, but he was motionless, and evidently at the mercy of the waves.\r\nHe was again drawn under the water, and was seen no more alive. Some\r\ndays later his body was found four miles below the fatal Rapids. It bore\r\ntokens of the fearful violence of the struggle which he had undergone.\r\nHis bathing drawers were torn to fragments, and there was a deep wound\r\nin his head. An inquest was held, and the jury returned a verdict of\r\n\"Found drowned.\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Webb was married about three years ago, and leaves a widow and\r\ntwo children. It is understood that he risked his life in this last\r\nfatal attempt to obtain money for the support of his family.--_London\r\nGraphic_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSEMI-DETACHED VILLAS, BROMFIELD CRESCENT, HEADINGLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese houses are situated in a pleasant part of Headingley, which is\r\nthe favorite residential suburb in the locality of Leeds. As regards\r\naccommodation, the ground-floor of each house comprises good-sized\r\ndrawing and dining rooms, each with bay windows; well-lighted entrance\r\nhalls, opening upon wooden verandas; kitchen, pantry, and scullery; on\r\nfirst floor are three good bedrooms, a bathroom, and other necessary\r\naccommodation; on second floor are two additional bedrooms. The basement\r\ncontains coal-place and larder.\r\n\r\nIn these houses an attempt has been made to produce conveniently-planned\r\nand well-arranged habitations, combined with a pleasing and picturesque\r\nexterior, without involving a large outlay of money. The materials used\r\nare brick of a deep red color for facings, red terra-cotta from Messrs.\r\nWilcock & Co., of Burmantofts, for moulded strings, sills, etc., and a\r\nvery sparing use of stone from the Harehills Quarries.

The statistics of the Parisian working\r\nclasses in the way of lodgings are not of an encouraging nature, and\r\nreflect great discredit on the powers that be, who can be stern enough\r\nin the case of any political question, but are blind to the spectacle\r\nof fellow creatures living the life of beasts under their very eyes. In\r\n1880, the Prefect of Police gave licenses to 21,219 arrivals in the city\r\nof French origin, and to 7,344 foreigners. In the succeeding year,\r\nthe former had increased to 22,061, while the latter had somewhat\r\ndiminished, being only 5,493. There was a census taken in 1881, from\r\nwhich it appeared that Paris contained 677,253 operatives and 255,604\r\nemployes and clerks, while out of every 1,000 inhabitants, 322 only\r\nwere born in the city, and 565 came from the departments or the French\r\ncolonies. The foreign element in the working classes has increased\r\nvery rapidly, numbering 119,349 in 1876, to which by 1881 there was an\r\naddition of 44,689. To every 1,000 inhabitants, Paris now numbers 75\r\nforeigners, though in 1876 the proportion was only 60. It may not be\r\namiss to state that the annual increase of the Paris population is at\r\nthe rate of 56,043 persons, and that in the five years 1876-81, the city\r\nreceived 280,217 additional mouths. The total population of the capital\r\nis 2,239,928, of whom 1,113,326 are males.\r\n\r\nReturning to the poorer classes, we find that in 1872 they were\r\nestimated at 100,000; but that in 1873 they had risen to 113,733, and\r\nin 1880 to 123,735. It is unfortunate to be obliged to say that the\r\nmajority of these people are housed worse in Paris than in almost any\r\nother great city in the world. There are two classes of lodgings for the\r\npoor--the one where the workman rents one or more rooms for his family,\r\nand, perhaps, owns a little furniture; the other, a single room tenanted\r\nfor the night only by the unmarried man who pays for his bed in the\r\nmorning and gets his meals anywhere that he can. Readers will remember\r\nhow, under the auspices of M. Haussmann, western Paris was almost pulled\r\ndown and transformed into a series of palatial boulevards and avenues.\r\nWhile the work lasted the Paris workman was well pleased; but he did\r\nnot like it quite so much when the demon of restoration and renovation\r\ninvaded his own quarters, such as the Butte des Moulins, and all that\r\ndensely populated district through which the splendid Avenue de l'Opera\r\nnow runs. The effect of all this was to drive the workman into the\r\nalready crowded quarters at the barriers, such as La Gare, St. Lambert,\r\nJavel, and Charonne, where, according to the last statistics of the\r\n_Annuaire_, the increase was at the rate of 415 per 1,000. Of course the\r\nill health that always pervaded these quarters increased also; and, from\r\nthe reports of Dr. Brouardel and M. Muller, the number of deaths from\r\ntyphoid and diphtheria were doubled in ten years. Dr. Du Mesnil, in\r\nmaking his returns for 1881 of convalescents from typhoid, remarked that\r\nthe most unsanitary arrondissements were the 4th, 11th, 15th, 18th, and\r\n19th--precisely those to which the principal migrations of laborers had\r\ntaken place. The 18th arrondissement, which in 1876 had only 601 lodging\r\nhouses with 8,933 lodgers, had, in 1882, over 850, with 20,816 inmates.\r\nIn the 19th arrondissement there were 517 houses in 1876, with 9,074\r\nlodgers, and 752 in 1882, with 17,662 inhabitants.\r\n\r\nIt is not only the crowded condition of the poor quarters that is such a\r\nstanding menace to the health of the city, but also the shocking state\r\nof the rooms, which the unhappy lodgers are obliged to put up with. The\r\nowners of the property are, as happens in other places besides Paris,\r\nunscrupulous and grasping to the last degree, and have not only divided\r\nand subdivided the accommodation wherever possible, but have even raised\r\nthe rental in nearly all cases. Whole families are crowded into a small\r\napartment, icy cold in winter, an oven in summer, the only air and\r\ndaylight which reaches the interior coming from a window which looks on\r\nto a dirty staircase or a still fouler court reeking with sewage. There\r\nare at the present time in Paris 3,000 lodgings which have neither stove\r\nnor chimney; over 5,000 lighted only by a skylight; while in 4,282 rooms\r\nthere are four children in each below 14 years of age; 7,199 with three\r\nchildren; and 1,049 with four beds in each. The Parisian population has\r\naugmented only 15 per cent. in seven years; but the district of poor\r\nlodging houses has increased by twenty per cent., and the number of\r\nlodgings by about 80 per cent. It is true that a law was passed in 1850\r\nto provide for the sanitary supervision of this class of property; but\r\nin Paris the law is a dead letter, and, although it is now active in the\r\nprovinces and in places like Marseilles, Lyons, Bordeaux, and Nantes, it\r\nis applied, even there, in a jerky and intermittent manner.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the worst of the abominable dogkennels called houses was the\r\ngroup known as the Cité des Kroumirs, in the 13th arrondissement, which,\r\nby a strange irony, was built on land belonging to the Department of\r\nPublic Assistance, which was let out by that body to a rich tenant, who\r\nsublet it to these lodging-house owners. This veritable den of infection\r\nand misery has now been demolished; but there are plenty of others quite\r\nas bad. Notably, there is the Cite Jeanne d'Arc (a poor compliment to\r\nhave named it after that sturdy heroine), an enormous barrack of five\r\nstories, which contains 1,200 lodgings and 2,486 lodgers. No wonder that\r\nit was decimated in 1879 by smallpox, which committed terrible ravages\r\nhere. The Cité Dore is grimly known by the poor-law doctors as the\r\n\"Cemetery Gateway.\" The Cite Gard, in the Rue de Meaux, is inhabited\r\nby 1,700 lodgers, although it is almost in ruins. The Cite Philippe is\r\ntenanted by 70 chiffonniers, and anybody who knows what are the contents\r\nof the chiffonnier's basket, or _hotte_, may easily guess at the\r\neffluvia of that particular group of houses. A large lodging-house in\r\nthe Rue des Boulangers is tenanted by 210 Italians, who get their living\r\nas models or itinerant musicians. Both house and tenants are declared to\r\nbe unapproachable from the vermin.\r\n\r\nIt is some satisfaction to know that these houses have lately awakened\r\nthe apathy of some of the public bodies, and that more than one\r\nscheme is being put forward with a view of erecting proper industrial\r\ndwellings. The Municipal Council is negotiating with the Credit Foncier\r\nfor the erection of a certain number of cheap houses, which, for the\r\nspace of twenty years, will be exempt from all taxes, such as\r\noctroi, highway, door and window tax, etc. There are also one or\r\ntwo semi-private companies, which are occupying themselves with the\r\nquestion, and it is to be hoped that the rumors of the pestilence in\r\nEgypt may hasten the much-needed reform.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt, says the _Engineer_, that the inventor who could\r\nsupply in a really portable form a machine or apparatus that could give\r\nout two or three horse power for a day would reap an enormous fortune.\r\nUp to the present time, however, nothing of the kind has been placed\r\nin the market. Gas is laid on to most houses now, and gas engines are\r\nplenty enough, yet they do not meet the want which a storage battery may\r\nbe made yet perhaps to supply.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECENT EXPERIMENTS AFFECTING THE RECEIVED THEORY OF MUSIC.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo prove the incorrectness of Helmholtz's statement that beats do not\r\ncolesce into musical sounds, but that the ear will distinguish them as a\r\nrumbling noise, even when their number rises as high as 132 vibrations\r\nper second, Rudolph Koenig has constructed a series of tuning forks,\r\nrecently presented by President Morton to the Stevens Institute of\r\nTechnology. The following table exhibits the number of vibrations per\r\nsecond of these forks, the ratios of their vibrations when two are\r\nsounded together, the number of beats produced, and the resultant sound:\r\n\r\n  Vibrations per second.

It is furnished for this purpose with\r\neight disks, each of which contains a given number of circles of\r\nholes arranged at different angular distances. A description of this\r\ninstrument, which is also the property of the Stevens Institute, and of\r\nSeebeck's experiments is thus given in a letter by Koenig himself.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n_Effects produced when the isochronism of the shocks is not perfect_.\r\n\r\nA.\r\n\r\nIn order to produce a note, the succession of shocks must not deviate\r\nmuch from isochronism.\r\n\r\nIf the isochronism is but little impaired, we obtain a note\r\ncorresponding to the mean interval of the shocks.\r\n\r\nIf the intervals between the shocks are alternately t and t', and if the\r\ndifference between t and t' is slight, we obtain the two notes t+t' and\r\n(t+t')/2. If the intervals between the shocks are alternately t, t', and\r\nt'', we obtain the two notes t+t'+t'' and (t+t'+t\")/3.\r\n\r\nDisk No. 1 has--\r\n\r\n  On circle No. 1 12 holes, angular distances   t=30°\r\n   \"   \"        2 24  \"       \"        \"          15°\r\n   \"   \"        3 36  \"       \"        \"          10°\r\n   \"   \"        4 36  \"     at irregular distances.\r\n   \"   \"        5 36  \" distances t= 10½°, t'=l0°,t''=9½°\r\n   \"   \"        6 36  \"   \"          11°      10°     9°\r\n   \"   \"        7 36  \"   \"          16°      14°\r\n   \"   \"        8 36  \"   \"          16½°     13½°\r\n\r\nCircle No. 8 produces the two notes of circles 1 and 2; circle No. 7 the\r\nsame, but the low note is stronger than in 8.\r\n\r\nCircle 6 produces the notes of circles 1 and 3, and so does circle 5,\r\nbut in the latter the low note is stronger than in 6.\r\n\r\nCircle 4 produces a noise approximating only to the note of circle 3.\r\n\r\nBy pulling out one of the buttons of the wind chest, we admit the air\r\nthrough eleven holes at a time, having an angular distance of 30° and\r\ndirecting it against the corresponding circle of holes on the turning\r\ndisk. If the arrangement of holes is not repeated identically twelve\r\ntimes on the same circle, we cannot, of course, make use of the above\r\narrangements of holes of the wind tube, and we must then employ one of\r\nthe movable brass tubes, which communicate with the interior of the wind\r\nchest by means of rubber tubes and stopcocks. The experiment with disk\r\n1, circle 4, for example, requires the use of one of these two tubes,\r\nwhile the perforated wind tube of the wind chest may be used with all\r\nthe other circles of the same disk.\r\n\r\nB.\r\n\r\nIf t is much less than t', while t' is a multiple of t, the note\r\n(t+t')/2 disappears, and the notes t+t' and t are heard.\r\n\r\nDisk No. 2 has--\r\n\r\n  On circle No. 1 12 holes,  distances 30°\r\n   \"   \"        2 36  \"       \"        10°\r\n   \"   \"        3 48  \"       \"        7½°\r\n   \"   \"        4 60  \"       \"         6°\r\n   \"   \"        5 24  \"       \" t= 5°, t'=25°\r\n   \"   \"        6 24  \"            6°     24°\r\n   \"   \"        7 24  \"            7½°    22½°\r\n   \"   \"        8 24  \"           10°     20°\r\n\r\nCircle 8 produces the notes of circles 1 and 2; circle 7, those of 1 and\r\n3; circle 6, those of 1 and 4; and circle 5, the note of circle 1 and of\r\nits sixth harmonic.\r\n\r\nC.\r\n\r\nIf the same circular arc is divided into m and n equal parts; that is to\r\nsay, if mt=nt', we obtain the notes m and n.\r\n\r\nDisk No. 3 has--\r\n\r\n                                                       Distances.\r\n  On circle No. 1 24 holes, distances 15°\r\n   \"   \"        2 24   \"        \"     15° & 27 holes,   13-1/3°\r\n   \"   \"        3 24   \"        \"     15° \" 30   \"      12°\r\n   \"   \"        4 24   \"        \"     15° \" 32   \"      11-1/4°\r\n   \"   \"        5 24   \"        \"     15° \" 36   \"      10°\r\n   \"   \"        6 24   \"        \"     15° \" 40   \"       9°\r\n   \"   \"        7 24   \"        \"     15° \" 45   \"       8°\r\n   \"   \"        8 24   \"        \"     15° \" 30, 36, & 48 holes\r\n\r\nCircle 1 produces a single note, circle 2 a second, circle 3 a third,\r\ncircle 4 a fourth, 5 a fifth, 6 a sixth, 7 a seventh, and 8 a perfect\r\nchord.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n_Experiments to prove that the shocks may proceed from two or several\r\ndifferent places to conspire in the formation of a note, provided that\r\nthe isochronism of the shocks is sufficiently exact, and that the shocks\r\nare produced in the same direction_.\r\n\r\nDisk No. 4 has--\r\n\r\n  On circle 1 24 holes.\r\n   \"    \"   2 36   \"\r\n   \"    \"   3 23   \"\r\n   \"    \"   4 12 at an angular distance of 10° from the holes\r\n                  of circle 3.\r\n   \"    \"   5 12 holes at an ang. dist. of 20° from those of circle 3\r\n   \"    \"   6 12   \"          \"     \"       0°        \"\r\n   \"    \"   7 12   \"          \"     \"      15°        \"\r\n   \"    \"   8 12   \"          \"     \"      15°        \"\r\n\r\n1. If from the same side two currents of air at an angular distance of\r\n15° are directed against circle No. 8 of 12 holes, we obtain the octave\r\nof the note produced by the same circle if only one current is used.\r\n\r\nThe wind-chest is provided with a special arrangement for this\r\nexperiment. By pulling out button 8, we give vent to 12 currents of air\r\nspaced like the twelve holes of the disk; on pulling out button 9 we\r\nalso produce 12 currents, but they are situated just between the first.\r\nEach of these two buttons pulled out alone will produce the same note\r\ncorresponding to 12 holes, but drawn together they produce the octave,\r\nor the note of circle 1.\r\n\r\n2. If two currents of air are directed against two similar circles whose\r\nholes are situated on the same radii, we obtain the same result.\r\n\r\nIn this experiment, circles 7 and 8 are sounded by pulling out buttons 7\r\nand 9.\r\n\r\n3. When two currents of air are directed on the same radius against two\r\ncircles of similar holes arranged alternately, these circles sounded\r\nsimultaneously will produce the octave of the note which one of them\r\nwould give alone.\r\n\r\nThis experiment is performed by sounding circles 6 and 7 and pulling out\r\nbuttons 6 and 7.\r\n\r\n4. If we direct three currents of air on the same radius against three\r\nsimilar circles having holes alternating by a third of the distance\r\nbetween two holes of the same circle, the three circles together produce\r\nthe fifth of the octave (Note 3) of a single circle.\r\n\r\nCircles 3, 4, and 5 sounded together emit the note of circle 2.\r\n\r\n(By sounding only two circles, 3 and 4, or 4 and 5, we make the same\r\nexperiment with two circles as disk No. 2 enabled us to make with\r\ncircle 8 alone; also, by sounding circle 3 alone, we obtain the note\r\ncorresponding to 12 holes; then pulling out button 4, the notes\r\ncorresponding to 12 and 36 holes are heard suddenly and very strongly;\r\nbut as soon as circle 5 is sounded also, the note of 12 disappears\r\ncompletely, and we have left only that corresponding to 36 holes.)\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n_Effects of interference produced by shocks in opposite directions_.\r\n\r\n1. If we direct against a circle of holes two currents of air in\r\nopposite directions, the note obtained with a single current is very\r\nmuch weakened, if the two currents reach the holes simultaneously.\r\nIf the impulses are not isochronous, the intensity of the note is\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\n2. If the two currents are directed against two circles of the same\r\nnumber of holes, the effect is the same as for the two preceding cases.\r\n\r\n3. If two currents of air are directed against two circles, one of which\r\nhas twice as many holes as the other, we obtain only the low note if\r\nevery shock of one is isochronous with every shock of the other.\r\n\r\nWe obtain the notes of both circles, one of which is the octave of the\r\nother, if there is no isochronism between the shocks.\r\n\r\nDisk No. 5 has three circles of 36, 36, and 72 holes. The air currents\r\nare directed against the circles of holes through the movable tubes,\r\nmade so that they can be detached at pleasure. All these experiments\r\nrequire great precision in the arrangement of these wind tubes. To make\r\nsure that the tubes are simultaneously before two holes of the disk, it\r\nis well to put little rods through the holes, reaching into the wind\r\ntubes, and to remove them only when the tubes are firmly attached. The\r\nexperimenter should be careful also to place the two tubes exactly\r\nat the same distance from the turning disk. It is clear that\r\nnotwithstanding all these precautions we never obtain perfect\r\ninterference, but only the weakening of notes that ought to disappear\r\nentirely if all the arrangements were made with mathematical exactness,\r\nand also if the ear could have absolutely the same position with regard\r\nto impulses produced in opposite directions.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\n_Beats_.\r\n\r\nDisk No. 6 has--\r\n\r\n8 circles of holes to the number of 1, 2, 23, 24, 25, 47, 48, 49.\r\n\r\nCircles 3 and 4, 4 and 5, 6 and 7, and 7 and 8 ought to produce as many\r\nbeats as circle 1 produces simple shocks; and circles 3 and 5, 6 and 8,\r\nas many beats as circle 2 produces simple shocks; but we must content\r\nourselves in these experiments with a much less perfect result, for the\r\nfollowing reasons: The disk never being rigorously plane, alternately\r\napproaches the single wind pipe and recedes from it. No matter how\r\nslight this deviation is, every sound given by a single circle is heard\r\nwith periodical intensities which complicate the phenomenon. This\r\ninconvenience could be avoided by placing several wind-pipes around the\r\ncircle; but while we can extend the period of the holes in two circles\r\n(whose difference is 1) around the whole circle by blowing through a\r\nsingle wind tube, we would be compelled to limit it to the distance\r\nbetween two wind tubes, and it would become too short; for, when the\r\ndisk rotates with a velocity sufficient to produce notes high enough and\r\nintense enough, the beats become too numerous to be easily perceived.\r\n\r\nBesides these provisions, which sufficiently illustrate the points to\r\nwhich we desire to call especial attention, Koenig also furnishes two\r\nmore disks.\r\n\r\nThe seventh contains 8 circles having 48, 54, 60, 64, 72, 80, 90, and\r\n96 holes respectively. The 1st, 3d, 5th, and 8th will produce a perfect\r\nchord when the air is admitted through the 11 holes in the wind chest;\r\nwith one wind tube the entire gamut may be obtained.\r\n\r\nFinally the eighth disk contains 8 circles of holes, whose numbers are\r\nin the ratio of 1:2:3:4, etc., and which may be used to illustrate\r\nharmonics.

For we wished,\r\nthrough this voluntary omission, to stimulate their sagacity by bringing\r\nthem face to face with difficulties that they will perhaps have\r\nsucceeded in overcoming, with causes of error that they will have\r\nperceived, and the principal one of which is the want of absolute\r\ncleanliness in the water, vessels, and instruments that they may have\r\nused for the experiments.\r\n\r\nThus, very probably, they will have more than once seen the camphor\r\nremain immovable when placed in vessels in which they had hoped to\r\nbe able to see it undergo its gyratory and other motions. Their\r\nastonishment will have been no less than our own was when we noticed\r\nthe sudden cessation of the camphor's motions under the influence of\r\nvitreous or metallic objects, such as glass rods or tubes, pieces of\r\ngold, silver, or copper coin, table knives, etc., dipped into the liquid\r\nin which such motions were taking place before the immersion of the\r\nobjects under consideration.\r\n\r\nThe instantaneously _sedative_ power of the human fingers, or of a hair,\r\nwill have, perhaps, reminded them of some sort of sorcery, or of some\r\ndiabolic art worthy of the great Albert.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: APPARATUS FOR THE STUDY OF THE MOTIONS OF CAMPHOR.]\r\n\r\nAs for ourself, we confess that, after repeating the curious experiments\r\nof Mr. Dutrochet day after day, and scrupulously following his\r\ndirections, we have, in the presence of our results, that were exactly\r\nidentical with his, almost been tempted to believe ourself to be the\r\nvictim of some occult power, or at least of some optical illusion,\r\nthe true cause of which remained a mystery to us. Finally, after\r\nmany fruitless attempts to find a key to the enigma that engaged our\r\nattention, the light finally dawned upon us, and then shone straight in\r\nour eyes.\r\n\r\nIn comparing the last results of our experiments with those that we had\r\nobtained previously, we saw, for example, that the camphor moved in the\r\ntest glasses at a level that was notably higher than that at which its\r\ngyration took place the day before, or the day before that. And yet we\r\nhad always used the same vessels, the same water, and particles detached\r\nfrom the same lump of camphor.\r\n\r\nTo what, then, could be due the difference observed between the two\r\nlevels at which we had, in the first and last place, seen the\r\ncamphor execute its movements? In the absence of any answer that was\r\nsatisfactory, we finally suspected that the difference that we had\r\nnoticed was ascribable to the fact that, after the numerous washings\r\nthat the apparatus had been submitted to in having water poured into\r\nthem to repeat the experiments, they had gradually been freed from\r\nimpurities of whatever nature they might have been, and which, unbeknown\r\nto us, might have soiled their sides.\r\n\r\nStarting with this idea, which was as yet a hyphothetical one, we began\r\nto wash our hands, glasses, etc., at first with very dilute sulphuric\r\nacid, and then with ammonia. Afterward we rinsed them with quantities of\r\nwater and dried them carefully with white linen rags that had been used\r\nfor no other purpose; and finally we plunged them again into very clean\r\nwater. We thus cut the Gordian knot, and were on the right track.\r\n\r\nIn fact, on again repeating Mr. Dutrochet's experiments, with that\r\nminute care as to cleanliness that we had observed to be absolutely\r\nnecessary, we saw crumble away, one after another, all the pieces of\r\nthe scaffolding that this master had with so much trouble built up. The\r\ncamphor moved in all our vessels, of glass or metal, and of every form,\r\nat all heights. The immersed bodies, such as glass tubes, table knives,\r\npieces of money, etc., had lost their pretended \"sedative effect\" on a\r\npretended \"activity of the water,\" and on the vessels that contained\r\nit. The so-called phenomenon of habit \"transported from physiology into\r\nphysics,\" no longer existed.\r\n\r\nThe likening of the apparatus employed to obtain motions of camphor\r\nupon water, with the entirely physiological apparatus by means of which\r\nnature effects a circulation of the liquid contained in the internodes\r\nof _Chara vulgaris_, had proved a grave error that was to be erased from\r\nthe science into which it had been introduced by its author with entire\r\ngood faith. The true cause of _life_ had not then been unveiled, and the\r\nnew agent designated as _diluo-electricity_ vanished before the very\r\nsimple and authentic fact that camphor moves rapidly upon the surface\r\nof very pure mercury, in which no one would assuredly suppose that that\r\nvolatile substance could dissolve.\r\n\r\nMr. Dutrochet attaches great importance to the manner in which the water\r\nis poured (with or without agitation) into the vessel with which\r\nthe experiment is performed. The matter is in fact of little or no\r\nimportance, and to prove this, it is only necessary to employ a test\r\nglass (see figure) provided with a lateral tube, A, that terminates in a\r\nlower tubulure, B, above which there is a contraction, C. Upon pouring\r\nwater into the lateral tube until the level reaches D, and placing\r\na particle of camphor on its surface, the camphor will be seen to\r\ncontinually move about, even when the liquid has reached the upper\r\nedge of the vessel. To reduce the level to various heights, it is only\r\nnecessary to revolve the tube in the cork through which it is fitted to\r\nthe tubulure. In proceeding thus, agitation or _collision_ of the water\r\nis avoided; and yet if the test glass is very clean, the camphor will\r\ncontinue to move at every level of the water.\r\n\r\nBut, some one will doubtless say, how do you explain the stoppage in the\r\nmotions of the camphor on the surface of water contained in vessels that\r\nare not perfectly clean? Before answering this question, let us say in\r\nthe first place that the cause of the motions under consideration is due\r\nto nothing else but the evaporation of this concrete oil--to effluvia\r\nthat escape from all parts and that exert upon the body whence they\r\nemanate a recoiling action exactly like that which manifests itself in\r\nan ælopile mounted upon a brasier, or, better yet, in the explosion of\r\na sky-rocket. A portion of these camphory vapors, as well as a small\r\nportion of the camphor itself, dissolves in the water and forms upon its\r\nsurface an oily layer which is at first very slight, but the thickness\r\nof which may increase in time until it becomes (especially if the vessel\r\nis narrow) a mechanical obstacle to the gyration of the small fragments\r\nof camphor that it imprisons, and whose evaporation it prevents. Now,\r\nas this layer of volatile oil may and does evaporate, in fact, after a\r\ncertain length of time, the camphor then resumes its gyratory motions;\r\nbut there is not the least reason in the world for saying on that\r\naccount that it \"has _habituated_ itself to the cause which had at first\r\ninfluenced it, and that, too, in modifying itself in such a way as to\r\nrender null the influence of a cause that has not ceased to be present\"\r\n(Dutrochet, _l.c._., p. 50).\r\n\r\nWe have been enabled to convince ourself of the existence of this oily\r\nlayer of camphor when it was of a certain thickness by introducing under\r\nthe water on which it, had formed, a few drops of sulphuric ether whose\r\nsudden evaporation produced sufficient cold to instantaneously congeal\r\nthe layer in question and thus render it perfectly visible to the eye.\r\nThe slight layer of greasy matter that habitually lines the sides of\r\nvessels from whence no effort has been made to remove it, produces\r\neffects exactly like those of the oil of camphor, that is to say, that\r\nin measure as it becomes thicker it likewise arrests the motions of the\r\nconcrete volatile essence.\r\n\r\nThis is precisely what happens in a test-glass in which we see the\r\ncamphor in motion become immovable if the level of the water be raised a\r\nfew centimeters, and, more especially, if it be raised to the upper edge\r\nof the apparatus. In its slow ascent the liquid _licks_ up, so to speak,\r\nthe oily layer that lines the inner surface of the vessel, and this\r\nmaterial spreads over the surface of the water and forms thereupon a\r\nlayer which, in spreading over the bit of camphor itself, prevents its\r\nevaporation, and, consequently, its motions. The existence of the layer\r\nunder consideration cannot be doubted, since it is made to disappear by\r\ncausing the water to-overflow from the edges of the vessel, and, more\r\neasily still, by spreading a piece of filtering paper over the liquid in\r\nwhich the camphor is in a state of rest. As soon as the paper is\r\nremoved (without the water being touched by the fingers, it should be\r\nunderstood), the camphor resumes its motions and afterward continues\r\nthem at all levels.\r\n\r\nThe fingers themselves, provided they are very clean, have no power to\r\nstop the gyration. The following experiment, which is easy to repeat, is\r\nan unquestionable proof of this.\r\n\r\nWash carefully the middle finger with aqua ammonia, and afterward with\r\nplenty of water, and then dip it into a drinking glass in which a\r\nfragment of camphor is rapidly moving, and the gyration will not be\r\nstopped. But it will be made to stop instantly if the finger in\r\nits natural state (that is, covered with the fatty substances that\r\nordinarily soil the fingers, especially in summer) be dipped into this\r\nsame glass.\r\n\r\n_Movements of Camphor upon Mercury_.--In order to study the motions of\r\ncamphor, mercury possesses, as compared with water, a great advantage,\r\nand that is that we can easily assure ourselves of the degree of\r\ncleanliness of this metal by means of the condensed breath. The\r\nvapory-deposits thereon in a uniform manner if the mercury is perfectly\r\nclean, but forms variously shaded and more persistent spots if it is\r\nsoiled by foreign bodies But it is extremely difficult to clean mercury\r\ncompletely. To do so Mr. Boisgiraud and I take distilled mercury and\r\nleave it for a long time in contact with concentrated sulphuric acid,\r\ntaking care to often shake the mixture. Then, after removing the greater\r\npart of the acid, we throw the metal into a vessel containing quick lime\r\nin powder, and finally pass it through a filter containing a few holes\r\nin its lower part.\r\n\r\nPurified by this process, mercury not only permits of the motions of\r\ncamphor on its surface, but renders visible the traces of the vapors\r\nthat escape from it, and which resemble small tadpoles with a long tail\r\nthat are endowed with very great agility. Nothing is more curious than\r\nto see the particle of camphor successively ascend and descend the\r\nstrongly pronounced curves presented by the mercury near the sides of\r\nthe vessel that contains it. On raising the temperature of the metal\r\nslightly, the motions of the camphor on its surface are accelerated, and\r\nthe same effects occur with water that has been slightly heated.\r\n\r\nThe experiments that we have just called attention to show what\r\nimportance slight impurities may have upon certain results. \"They\r\nprove,\" says our learned colleague Mr. Daquin, \"that there exists upon\r\npolished substances an imperceptible coating of those fatty matters\r\nwhich serve to-day to explain Moser's images.\" We find therein also a\r\nmanifest proof and a rational explanation of those grave errors into\r\nwhich the presence of these fatty matters, that have hitherto been\r\nscarcely suspected, led so clever and so distinguished a scientist as\r\nthe illustrious discoverer of endosmosis.--_N.

E. Siebel in 1872, and\r\nused at that time in the brewery of Messrs. Bartholomae & Roesing, in\r\nChicago. The object of the apparatus is to retain as much carbonic acid\r\nin the beer as possible while racking the same off into smaller packages\r\nfrom the storage vats. The importance of this measure is apparent to\r\nevery one who knows what pains are taken to preserve the presence of\r\nthis constituent in all the former stages of the brewing process. In the\r\nmethod of racking off which is in present use in most breweries, the\r\nbeer is forced through a rubber hose from the cask in the store vault to\r\nthe barrels, kegs, and smaller packages in the fill room. Owing to the\r\nexcess of pressure in the beer as it enters the keg, it is evident that\r\na large amount of the carbonic acid gas must escape. The escape of\r\ncarbonic acid during the process of racking off is indeed so large that\r\neven a small difference in the pressure of the atmosphere causes a\r\nremarkable difference in this respect. It is, therefore, evident that if\r\na larger pressure can be maintained while racking off, a larger amount\r\nof carbonic acid gas will remain in the beer. It is true that the\r\nracking off will take a little longer time if done under pressure, but\r\nthis inconvenience is certainly insignificantly small, when compared\r\nwith the other labors and troubles daily undergone in a brewery, for the\r\nsole purpose to preserve in the beer the carbonic acid in that form in\r\nwhich it has been formed during the fermentation, and in which form it\r\nhas far more refreshing and other valuable properties than in any\r\nother form in which it may be subsequently introduced into the beer by\r\nartificial means. The apparatus designed in the accompanying cut is\r\ncalculated to artificially produce a higher pressure of the atmosphere,\r\nat least within the keg which is to be filled with beer. For this\r\npurpose, the beer from the store cask running through the pipe, B,\r\nenters the keg through a hollow copper bung, fitting light into the bung\r\nhole by means of a rubber washer. The air contained in the keg, being\r\nreplaced by the beer, is forced out by means of the hollow copper bung,\r\ntaking its course through the pipe, inscribed \"Glass Gauge,\" until it is\r\nallowed to escape in the standpipe, C, containing a column of water,\r\nthe height of which designates the pressure within the keg, and a\r\nconsequently increased retention of carbonic acid gas. If the keg or\r\nbarrel is filled with beer, the same becomes apparent from the beer\r\nshowing itself in the glass gauge; then the faucet, B, is closed, the\r\ncopper bung is lifted out of the bung hole, and the beer contained in\r\nthe pipe is just sufficient to completely fill the keg, which is then\r\nbunged up, while the apparatus is transferred to the next keg. Should\r\nthe attendant carelessly neglect to close the faucet in proper time, the\r\nsurplus beer will not necessarily be wasted, but will be collected in\r\nthe vessel, D, whence it can be drawn off through e.--_Chemical Review_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE DIFFERENT MODIFICATIONS OF SILVER BROMIDE AND SILVER CHLORIDE.\r\n\r\n\r\nHermann W. Vogel has made a comparative study of the properties of\r\nsilver bromide, obtained by precipitation in an aqueous solution of\r\ngelatin, and those of the same compound prepared by precipitation in an\r\nalcoholic solution of collodion. In 1874 Stas called attention to six\r\nmodifications of silver bromide. One of these, granular bromide of\r\nsilver, obtained by boiling the flocculent precipitate for several days\r\nwith water, he stated, was the most sensitive to light of all substances\r\nknown; exposure for two or three seconds to the pale blue flame of a\r\nBunsen burner being sufficient to blacken it. Important as this fact was\r\nfor photographers it was not applied for years, and it was only in\r\n1878, when, it having been found that silver bromide precipitated in\r\na gelatine solution and boiled for several hours becomes much more\r\nsensitive to light, that the remarks of Stas was recalled. Today these\r\nobservations have become of the greatest importance to practical\r\nphotography. They have led to the preparation of the silver bromide\r\ngelatin emulsion and the silver bromide gelatin plates, which are twenty\r\ntimes more sensitive than the silver iodide collodion plates, and have\r\nbecome indispensable when impressions are to be taken in a dim light.\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary sensitiveness of silver bromide in gelatin seemed the\r\nmore remarkable since it was known that silver bromide in collodion is\r\nonly moderately sensitive. The explanation was sought for in various\r\ndirections, but as the result of numerous investigations it appears\r\nthat the chief cause of the difference is the presence of different\r\nmodifications of silver bromide. From a consideration of the work\r\nalready done on the subject, Vogel suspected that silver bromide\r\nprecipitated in an aqueous colloidal liquid would have notably different\r\nproperties from silver bromide precipitated in an alcoholic colloidal\r\nsolution. Silver bromide was prepared in many different ways. Emulsions\r\nwere made in bromide solutions containing gelatin or collodion (the\r\nformer aqueous, the latter alcoholic), some with the aid of heat, others\r\nwithout. Part of the emulsion was then poured upon plates kept at a\r\nmoderate temperature and dried. The remainder was boiled or treated with\r\nammonia before being applied to the plates. He also precipitated silver\r\nbromide in dilute gelatin or collodion solutions, allowed it to settle\r\ncompletely, washed the precipitate, and mixed it with a new portion\r\nof gelatin or collodion before applying it to the plates. Finally he\r\nprecipitated pure silver bromide, in the absence of all colloids, by\r\nmeans of pure aqueous or alcoholic solutions of bromides and attempted\r\nto bring this upon plates, using gelatin or collodion as a cement.\r\nThe result of all these experiments is that there are essentially two\r\nmodifications of silver bromide, the one being obtained by precipitation\r\nin aqueous, the other in alcoholic solutions. The first, on account of\r\nthe position of the maximum of sensitiveness for the solar spectrum, he\r\ncalls blue sensitive, the other, for the same reason, indigo sensitive.\r\n\r\nIt is of no consequence whether the aqueous or alcoholic solution in\r\nwhich the silver bromide is formed contains gelatin or collodion, or\r\nwhether the precipitation is effected with excess of bromide or of\r\nsilver nitrate. It makes no difference whether the solution is hot or\r\ncold, or whether the silver bromide is treated with ammonia or\r\nwhether it is boiled or not. The only necessary condition is that in\r\nprecipitating indigo sensitive silver bromide the solutions must contain\r\nat least 96 per cent of alcohol. From aqueous alcoholic solutions blue\r\nsensitive silver bromide is precipitated.\r\n\r\nBesides the difference of sensitiveness toward the solar spectrum, these\r\nmodifications of silver bromide exhibit other characteristic differences\r\nin properties which indicate beyond a doubt that they are two\r\nessentially different modifications of the same substance. Among these\r\nare, 1st. Their unequal divisibility in gelatin or collodion solutions.\r\nThe indigo sensitive silver bromide cannot be distributed through a\r\ngelatin solution, while the blue sensitive modification does so very\r\nreadily. 2d. Their unequal reducibility; the blue sensitive silver\r\nbromide being reduced with much greater difficulty than the indigo\r\nsensitive variety. 3d. Their different action toward chemical and\r\nphysical sensitizers. 4th. Their different action toward photographic\r\ndevelopers. 5th. Their different action under the influence of heat.\r\nThe blue sensitive variety if heated under water has its sensitiveness\r\nperceptibly increased, while the other is not changed by such treatment.\r\n\r\nA direct transformation of one modification into the other has not yet\r\nbeen accomplished. The effect of the light upon these substances is\r\nincipient reduction, and we might hence suppose that the more reducible\r\nindigo sensitive variety would be the more sensitive to light. But\r\nthis is not the case, because it is not chemical reducibility, but the\r\nabsorption power for light that is of the greatest importance. Now the\r\nblue sensitive silver bromide has a greater absorption power than the\r\nindigo sensitive variety, and hence its greater sensitiveness. Silver\r\nchloride prepared by methods similar to those used in making the two\r\nforms of bromides was also found to exist in two modifications. One is\r\ndesignated as ultra violet sensitive, the other as violet sensitive\r\nsilver chloride.--_Amer. Chem.

RAYMOND.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe method in question is recommended as easy, expeditious, and\r\naccurate. It consists in precipitating all the manganese in the state of\r\nperoxide, dissolving it in a ferrous solution so as to bring back the\r\nmanganese to the manganous slate, and determining volumetrically, by\r\nmeans of potassium permanganate, the quantity of ferrous salt which\r\nhas been converted into ferric. The method of rapidly precipitating\r\nmanganese peroxide is peculiar. If we act upon cast-iron or steel with\r\nnitric acid and potassium chlorate in certain proportions, and boil\r\nthe mixture, the manganese is completely precipitated in the state of\r\nperoxide insoluble in nitric acid, but retaining a small quantity of\r\nferric oxide. Suppose that we have a sample of steel or manganiferous\r\ncast-iron containing less than 7 per cent of manganese. Three grammes\r\nare treated in a small flask with 40 c. c. of nitric acid, of sp. gr.\r\n1.20, added little by little. The liquid is stirred, and ultimately\r\nheated to complete solution. It is withdrawn from the fire, and 15\r\ngrammes potassium chlorate are added, and then 20 c. c. of nitric acid\r\nat sp. gr. 1.40. It is boiled for about fifteen minutes, until the\r\nescape of chlorine ceases; all the manganese is found thrown down\r\nas peroxide; hot water is added, the mixture is filtered, and the\r\nprecipitate washed with boiling water. To dissolve the manganese\r\nperoxide thus obtained we measure exactly 50 c. c. of an acid solution\r\nof ferrous sulphate, made up with 40 grammes ferrous sulphate to 750 c.\r\nc. water and 230 c. c. sulphuric acid (full strength). The 50 c. c. are\r\npoured into the flask in which the sample has been dissolved, and\r\nto which a little peroxide adheres, and it is then poured upon the\r\nprecipitate and the filter in a Berlin-ware capsule. The manganese\r\nperoxide dissolves very readily, transforming its equivalent of ferrous\r\nsulphate into ferric sulphate. The liquid is then diluted to 100 or 150\r\nc. c. for the next operation. We then take a solution of permanganate\r\nformed by the same proportions as are used in determining iron by the\r\nprocess of Margueritte (5.65 grammes of the crystalline salt per liter\r\nof water), and determine its standard exactly. By means of this liquid\r\nwe determine volumetrically the quantity of ferrous sulphate remaining\r\nin the solution of manganese. We take then 50 c. c. of the original\r\nsolution of ferrous sulphate diluted as above, and determine the total\r\nferrous salt.\r\n\r\nThe difference between the two determinations corresponds to the ferrous\r\nsalt which has been peroxidized by the manganese peroxide. The quantity\r\nof iron thus peroxidized multiplied by 0.491 gives the quantity of\r\nmanganese contained in the portion operated upon. In the case of a\r\nsteel or cast iron containing but little manganese it is convenient to\r\ndissolve the peroxide in 25 c. c. only of the ferrous solution. Small\r\nGay-Lussac burettes may then be used in the titration of only 0.010\r\nmeter internal diameter, and graduated into one-twentieth c. c., which\r\nallows of great exactitude in the determination. For a spiegeleisen\r\nnot more than 1 gramme of the sample should be taken, and for a\r\nferro-manganese 0.3 gramme.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMANGANESE AND ITS USES.\r\n\r\n\r\nManganese is one of the heavy metals of which iron may he taken as the\r\nrepresentative. It is of a grayish white color, presents a metallic\r\nbrilliancy, and is capable of a high degree of polish, is so hard as to\r\nscratch glass and steel, is non-magnetic, and is only fused at a white\r\nheat. As it oxidizes rapidly on exposure to the atmosphere, it should be\r\npreserved under naphtha.\r\n\r\nIt occurs in small quantity in association with iron in meteoric stones;\r\nwith this exception it is not found native. The metal may be obtained by\r\nthe reduction of its sesquioxide by carbon at an extreme heat.\r\n\r\nManganese forms no less than six different oxides--viz., protoxide,\r\nsesquioxide the red oxide, the binoxide or peroxide, manganic acid, and\r\npermanganic acid. The protoxide occurs as olive-green powder, and is\r\nobtained by igniting carbonate of manganese in a current of hydrogen.\r\nIts salts are colorless, or of a pale rose color, and have a strong\r\ntendency to form double salts with the salts of ammonia. The carbonate\r\nforms the mineral known as manganese spar. The sulphate is obtained by\r\nheating the peroxide with sulphuric acid till there is faint ignition,\r\ndissolving the residue in water and crystallizing. It is employed\r\nlargely in calico printing. The silicate occurs in various minerals.\r\n\r\nThe sesquioxide is found crystallized in an anhydrous form in braunite,\r\nand hydrated in manganite. It is obtained artificially as a black powder\r\nby exposing the peroxide to a prolonged heat. When ignited it loses\r\noxygen, and is converted into red oxide. Its salts are isomorphous with\r\nthose of alumina and sesquioxide of iron. It imparts a violet color to\r\nglass, and gives the amethyst its characteristic tint. Its sulphate is a\r\npowerful oxidizing agent.\r\n\r\nThe red oxide corresponds to the black oxide of iron. It occurs native\r\nin hausmannite, and may be obtained artificially by igniting the\r\nsesquioxide or peroxide in the open air. It is a compound of the two\r\npreceding oxides.\r\n\r\nThe binoxide, or peroxide, is the black manganese of commerce, and the\r\npyrolusite of mineralogists, and is by far the most abundant of the\r\nmanganese ores. It occurs in a hydrated form in varvicite and wad. Its\r\ncommercial value depends upon the proportion of chlorine which a given\r\nweight of it will liberate when it is heated with hydrochloric acid, the\r\nquantity of chlorine being proportional to the excess of oxygen which\r\nthis oxide contains over that contained in the same weight of protoxide.\r\nWhen mixed with chloride of sodium and sulphuric acid it causes an\r\nevolution of chlorine, the other resulting products being sulphate of\r\nsoda and sulphate of protoxide of manganese. When mixed with acids, it\r\nis a valuable oxidizing agent. It is much used for the preparation of\r\noxygen, either by simply heating it, when it yields 12 per cent. of\r\ngas, or by heating it with sulphuric acid, when it yields 18 per\r\ncent. Besides its many uses in the laboratory, it is employed in the\r\nmanufacture of glass, porcelain, and kindred wares.\r\n\r\nManganic acid is not known in a free state. Manganate of potash is\r\nformed by fusing together hydrated potash and binoxide of manganese. The\r\nblack mass which results from this operation is soluble in water,\r\nto which it communicates a green color, due to the presence of the\r\nmanganate. From this water the salt is obtained _in vacuo_ in beautiful\r\ngreen crystals. On allowing the solution to stand exposed to the air, it\r\nrapidly becomes blue, violet, purple, and finally red, by the gradual\r\nconversion of the manganate into the permanganate of potash; and on\r\naccount of these changes of color the black mass has received the name\r\nof mineral chameleon.\r\n\r\nPermanganic acid is only known in solution or in a state of combination.\r\nIts solution is of a splendid red color, but appears of a dark violet\r\ntint when seen by transmitted light. It is obtained by treating a\r\nsolution of permanganate of baryta with sulphuric acid, when sulphate of\r\nbaryta falls, and the permanganic acid remains dissolved in the water.\r\nPermanganate of potash, which crystallizes in reddish purple prisms, is\r\nthe most important of its salts. It is largely employed in analytical\r\nchemistry, and is the basis of Condy's Disinfectant Fluid.\r\n\r\nManganese is a constituent of many mineral waters, and is found in small\r\nquantities in the ash of most vegetables and animal substances. It is\r\nalways associated with iron.\r\n\r\nVarious preparations of manganese have been employed in medicine. The\r\nsulphate of the protoxide in doses of one or two drachms produces\r\npurgative effects, and is supposed to increase the excretion of bile;\r\nand in small doses, both this salt and the carbonate have been given\r\nwith the intention of improving the condition of the blood in cases of\r\nanæmia. Manganic acid and permanganate of potash are of great use when\r\napplied in lotions (as in Condy's Fluid diluted) to foul and fetid\r\nulcers. In connection with the medicinal applications of manganese it\r\nmay be mentioned that manganic acid is the agent employed in Dr. Angus\r\nSmith's celebrated test for the impurity of the air.\r\n\r\nIt is the glass maker's soap of glass manufacture, and is used to\r\ncorrect the green color of glass, which is owing to the presence of\r\nprotoxide of iron. This it converts into the comparatively colorless\r\nperoxide.\r\n\r\nIt is also used in the Bessemer and similar processes, to decompose the\r\noxide of iron. Spiegeleisen, an iron which contains a natural alloy of\r\nfrom 10 to 12 per cent. of manganese, is used for this purpose when\r\nconveniently attainable.--_Glassware Reporter_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOZOKERITE, OR EARTH-WAX.\r\n\r\nBy WILLIAM L. LAY.\r\n\r\nON THE DEPOSITS OF EARTH WAX (OZOKERITE) IN EUROPE AND AMERICA.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: Abstract from a paper read before the New York Academy of\r\nSciences.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThere exists a large mining and manufacturing industry in Austria, that\r\nof ozokerite, or earth-wax, which has nothing like it in any other part\r\nof the known world, an industry that supplies Europe with a part of its\r\nbeeswax, without the aid of the bees. It may not be generally known that\r\nthe mining of petroleum was a profitable industry in Austria long before\r\nit was in this country. In 1852, a druggist near Tarnow distilled the\r\noil and had an exhibit of it in the first World's Fair in London.\r\nIn America, the first borings were made in 1859. Indeed, the use of\r\npetroleum as an illuminator was common at a very early age in the\r\nworld's history. In Persia at Baku, in India on the Irawada, also in the\r\nCrimea, and on the river Kuban in Russia, petroleum has been used\r\nin lamps for thousands of years. At Baku the fire worshipers have a\r\nnever-ceasing flame, which has burned from time immemorial. The mines of\r\nozokerite are located in Austrian Poland, now known as Galicia. Near the\r\ncity of Drohabich, on the railway line running from Cracow to Lemberg,\r\nis a town of six thousand inhabitants, called Borislau, which is\r\nentirely supported by the ozokerite industry. It lies at the foot of\r\nthe Carpathian Mountains. About the year 1862, a shaft was sunk for\r\npetroleum at that place. After descending about one hundred and eighty\r\nfeet, the miners found all the cracks in the clay or rock filled with\r\na brown substance, resembling beeswax. At first, the layers were not\r\nthicker than writing paper; but they grew thicker gradually below, until\r\nat a depth of three hundred feet they attained a thickness of three or\r\nfour inches. Upon examination, it was found that a yellow wax could be\r\nmade of a portion of this substance, and at once a substitute for wax\r\nwas manufactured.\r\n\r\nThe discovery caused an excitement like the oil fever of 1865 in\r\nAmerica. A large number of leases were made. When I saw the wells of\r\nPennsylvania, in 1879, there were more than two thousand. The owner\r\nof the land received one-fourth of the product, and the miners\r\nthree-fourths. In the petroleum region, the leases at first were whole\r\nfarms, then they were reduced to 20, then 10, then 5, and at last to 1\r\nacre, which is a square of 209 feet.\r\n\r\nBut in the ozokerite region of Poland, where everything is done on a\r\nsmall scale, when compared with like enterprises in this country, the\r\nleases were on tracts thirty-two feet square. These were so small that\r\nthe surface was not large enough to contain the earth that had to be\r\nraised to sink the shaft; consequently the earth had to be transported\r\nto a distance, and, when I saw it, there was a mound sixty or seventy\r\nfeet high. Its weight had become so great that it caused a sinking\r\nof the earth, and endangered the shafts to such an extent that the\r\ngovernment ordered its removal to a distance and its deposit on ground\r\nthat was not undermined. The shafts are four feet square, and the sides\r\nare supported by timbers six inches through, which leaves a shaft three\r\nfeet square. The miner digs the well or shaft just as we dig our water\r\nwells, and the dirt and rock are hoisted up in a bucket by a rope and\r\nwindlass. But one man can work in the shaft at a time. For many years\r\nno water was found; but, as there is a deposit of petroleum under the\r\nozokerite, at a depth of six hundred feet from the surface, the miners\r\nwere troubled with gas. This is got rid of by blowing a current of fresh\r\nair from a rotary fan through a pipe extending down the shaft as fast as\r\nthe curbing of timber is put in place. The ozokerite is embedded in a\r\nvery stiff blue clay for a depth of several hundred feet; below, it is\r\ninterlaid with rock. [Specimens of crude and manufactured ozokerite were\r\non exhibition, through the kindness of Dr. J. S. Newberry.]\r\n\r\nThat part of the earth's surface has more miners' shafts to the acre\r\nthan any other part of the globe. As wages are very low in Poland,\r\naveraging not more than forty cents a day for men and ten cents for\r\nchildren, a very small quantity of ozokerite pays for the working. If\r\nthirty or forty pounds a day is obtained, it remunerates the two men\r\nand one or two children required to work each lease. When the bucket,\r\ncontaining the earth, rock, and wax, is dumped in the little shed\r\ncovering the shaft, it is picked over by the children, who detach the\r\nwax from the clay or rock with knives. The miners use galvanized wire\r\nropes and wooden buckets. When preparing to descend, they invariably\r\ncross themselves and utter a short prayer. The business is not free from\r\ndanger, carelessness on the part of the boy supplying the fresh air, or\r\nthe caving in of the unsupported roof, causing a large number of deaths.\r\nOne of the government inspectors of the mines informed me that in one\r\nweek there had been eight deaths from accidents.\r\n\r\nThe ozokerite is taken to a crude furnace, and put into a common cast\r\niron kettle, and melted. This allows the dirt to sink to the bottom, and\r\nthe ozokerite, freed from all other solids, is skimmed off with a ladle,\r\npoured into conical moulds, and allowed to cool, in which form it is\r\nsold to the refiners, for about six cents per pound. The quantity\r\nproduced is uncertain, as the miners take care to understate it, for\r\nthe reason that the government lays a tax upon all incomes, and the\r\nlandowner demands his one-fourth of the quantity mined. The best\r\nauthority is Leo Strippelman, who states the quantity produced in\r\nfifteen years at from 375,000,000 to 400,000,000 pounds, worth\r\ntwenty-four millions of dollars. As the owners of the land get\r\none-fourth of the sum, they received six millions. This is at the rate\r\nof four hundred thousand a year, a rather valuable crop from some two\r\nhundred acres of land.\r\n\r\nThe miners do not support the earth by timber or pillars, as they\r\nshould; the result is that the whole plot of about two hundred acres is\r\ngradually sinking, and this will eventually ruin the industry in that\r\npart of the deposit. In another part of the same field, a French company\r\nhas purchased forty acres, and it is mining the whole tract and hoisting\r\nthrough one shaft by steam power. In that shaft they have sunk to a\r\ndepth of six hundred feet, and are troubled with water and petroleum.\r\nThese they pump out very much the same way as in coal and other mines,\r\nworked in a scientific manner. The thickest layer of ozokerite found is\r\nabout eighteen inches, and this layer or pocket was a great curiosity.\r\nWhen first removed at the bottom of the shaft, it was found to be so\r\nsoft that it was shoveled out like putty. During the night it oozed\r\ninto the space that had been emptied the day before; this continued for\r\nweeks, or until the pressure of the gas had become too weak to force it\r\nout.\r\n\r\nI have been occupied in the petroleum region of Pennsylvania since 1860,\r\nhave seen all the wonderful development of the oil wells, and was very\r\nmuch interested in contrasting the Austrian ozokerite and petroleum\r\nindustry with the American. It is a good illustration of the difference\r\nbetween the lower class of Poles and Jews and the Yankee. Borislau,\r\nafter twenty years' work, was unimproved, dirty, squalid, and brutal. It\r\ncontained one school house, but no church nor printing office. None of\r\nits streets were paved, and, in the main road through the town, the mud\r\ncame up to the hubs of the wagon wheels for over a mile of its length.\r\nIn places, plank had to be set up on edge to keep the mud out of the\r\nhouses, which were lower than the road. It contained numerous shops,\r\nwhere potato whisky was sold to men, women, and children. It depends on\r\na dirty, muddy creek for its supply of water. Its houses were generally\r\none-story, built of logs and mud.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Oil City, a town of the same age and size, contained\r\neight school houses (one a high school building), twelve churches, and\r\ntwo printing offices. It has paved streets, which, in 1863, were as deep\r\nwith mud as those in Borislau in 1879. It has no whisky shops where\r\nwomen and children can drink. Many of its houses are of brick, two,\r\nthree, four, and five stories high. Its water works cost one hundred and\r\nfifty thousand dollars. All this has been done since 1860, when it did\r\nnot contain forty houses.\r\n\r\nI saw in the market place of Borislau women standing ankle deep in the\r\nmud, selling vegetables. One woman really had to build a platform of\r\nstraw, on which to place a bushel of potatoes; if the straw foundation\r\nhad not been there, the potatoes would have sunk out of sight. Borislau\r\nis three miles from Drohobich, a city of thirty thousand inhabitants;\r\nbetween the two places, in wet weather, the road was impassable. For a\r\nthird of the way, it was in the bed of the creek; and I had to wait a\r\nday for the water to fall so as to navigate it in a wagon. On inquiring\r\nwhy they did not improve the road, I found the same difficulty as the\r\nArkansas settler encountered with his leaky roof; when it rained he\r\ncould not repair it, and when it was dry it did not need repair: so with\r\nthe road to Borislau.\r\n\r\nOzokerite (from the Greek words, \"Ozein,\" to smell, and \"Keros,\" wax) is\r\nfound in Turkistan, east of the Caspian Sea; in the Caucasian Mountains,\r\nin Russia; in the Carpathian Mountains, in Austria; in the Apennines,\r\nin Italy; in Texas, California, and in the Wahsatch Mountains, in the\r\nUnited States. Commercially, it is not worked anywhere but in Austria;\r\nalthough, I believe, we have in Utah a larger deposit than in any other\r\nplace. I made two journeys to examine the deposits in the Wahsatch\r\nMountains. For a distance of forty miles, it crops out in many places,\r\nand on the Minnie Maud, a stream emptying into the Colorado, I found\r\na stratum of sand rock, from ten to twelve feet thick, filled with\r\nozokerite.\r\n\r\nNo systematic effort has been made to ascertain the quantity of\r\nozokerite in Utah. I saw a drift of some fourteen feet at one place, and\r\na shaft twenty-three feet deep at another. In this shaft, the vein was\r\nabout ten inches wide; and it could be traced along the slope of the\r\nhill, for several hundred feet. The largest vein of pure ozokerite is\r\nseen on Soldiers' Fork of Spanish Cañon, which enters Salt Lake Valley\r\nnear the town of Provo. This vein is very much like the ozokerite of\r\nAustria, and contains between thirty and forty per cent. of white\r\nceresin (which resembles bleached beeswax), about thirty per cent. of\r\nyellow ceresin (which resembles yellow wax), and twenty per cent. of\r\nblack petroleum; the residue is dirt. Dr. J. S. Newberry, of Columbia\r\nCollege, and Prof. S. B. Newberry, of Cornell University, made\r\nexaminations of the ozokerite found in Utah; those who are interested\r\nin the subject will find the papers published in the _Engineering and\r\nMining Journal_ for the year 1879.\r\n\r\nA deposit of white ozokerite occurs on the top of the Apennine\r\nMountains, in Italy, of which a specimen is here exhibited. An\r\ninteresting story is told of its discovery. A church at Modena was\r\nrobbed; among other articles taken was a quantity of wax candles. A\r\nshort time afterward, a woman brought to a druggist a quantity of wax\r\nand offered it for sale. The druggist bought it and afterward suspected\r\nit consisted of the stolen candles melted down. Soon after ward she\r\nbrought another lot. He had her arrested. When questioned by the\r\nmagistrate, she said she found the wax in the clay on her farm, about\r\ntwenty miles from the city. This story confirmed him in the belief that\r\nshe had stolen the candles, or was the receiver of the stolen goods; for\r\nsuch a thing as a deposit of wax in the soil was unheard of. She was\r\ntherefore remanded to jail. On three several days, she was brought\r\nbefore the court, and, when questioned, told the same story. She was a\r\nmember of the church, and requested the priest to be sent for. He came,\r\nand, after an interview between them, he said it was easy to disprove\r\nher story, if it was a lie, by sending her home, in company with an\r\nofficer, to investigate. The court sent the priest, who was the only one\r\nwho believed her. On coming to her house, she took her pick and shovel,\r\nand going to the place at the top of the hill, she dug out of the clay\r\na quantity of while ozokerite, proved her case, and was at once set at\r\nliberty. She performed the same service for me, and I saw her dig the\r\nspecimen and heard her tell the story as I have told it to you. The hill\r\nwas composed of loose clay and stones. It appeared as if it had been\r\nforced up by gas or some power from below the surface. The quantity that\r\ncould be gathered, by one person, laboring constantly for a week, was\r\nonly twenty-five or thirty pounds. An attempt had been made to sink a\r\nshaft; but, at a depth of fourteen feet, the pressure of the clay was\r\nsufficient to break the boards that held up the sides. The earth caved\r\nin, and the shaft was abandoned.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary here to describe the various processes of\r\nmanufacture; it will be sufficient to enumerate some of the forms of\r\nozokerite, and the uses to which it is put. At Borislau, there are\r\nseveral refineries, where candles, tapers, and lubricating oils are\r\nmade. In Vienna, there are five factories; in one of these, they make\r\nwhite wax, wax candles, matches, yellow beeswax, black heel-ball,\r\ncolored tapers, and crayon pencils. In Europe, large quantities of the\r\nyellow wax are used to wax the floors of the houses, many of the finer\r\nones being waxed every day. It is a curious fact that the Catholic\r\nChurch does not allow the use of paraffine, sperm, or stearine candles;\r\nat the same time nearly all the candles used in the churches in Europe\r\nare made from ozokerite, which is a natural paraffine, made from\r\npetroleum in nature's laboratory. In the United States, the only\r\nuses made of ozokerite, so far as I know, are chewing gum and the\r\nadulteration of beeswax. In this the Yankee gives another illustration\r\nof the ruling passion strong in money making, which gives us wooden\r\nnutmegs, wooden hams, shoddy cloth, glucose candy, chiccory coffee,\r\noleomargarine butter, mineral sperm oil made from petroleum, and beeswax\r\nmade without bees.\r\n\r\nAfter this paper was written, the following translation from a pamphlet,\r\npublished by the First Hungarian Galician Railway Company, in 1879, came\r\nto my notice. The writer's name is not published:\r\n\r\n\"Mineral wax, in the condition in which it is taken from the shafts,\r\nis not well adapted for exportation, since it occurs with much earthy\r\nmatter; and, at any rate, an expensive packing in sacks would be\r\nnecessary. It is therefore first freed from all foreign substances by\r\nmelting, and cooled in conical cakes of about 25 kilos. weight, and\r\nthese cakes are exported. There are now, in Borislau, 25 melting works,\r\nwhich, in 1877, with 1 steam and 60 fire kettles, produced 95,000 metric\r\ncentners (9,500,000 lb.).\r\n\r\n\"The melted earth wax is sent from Borislau to almost all European\r\ncountries, to be further refined. Outside of Austro-Hungary, we may\r\nspecially mention Germany, England, Italy, France, Belgium, and Russia\r\nas large purchasers of this article of commerce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"PRODUCTS AND THEIR APPLICATIONS.\r\n\r\n\"The products of mineral wax, are:\r\n\r\n\"(a.) _Ceresine_, also called ozocerotine or refined ozokerite, a\r\nproduct which possesses a striking resemblance to ordinarily refined\r\nbeeswax. It replaces this in almost all its uses, and, by its cheapness,\r\nis employed for many purposes for which beeswax is too dear. It is much\r\nused for wax candles, for waxing floors, and for dressing linen and\r\ncolored papers. Wax crayons must be mentioned among these products. The\r\nhouse of Offenheim & Ziffer, in Elbeteinitz, makes them of many colors.\r\nThese crayons are especially adapted to marking wood, stone, and iron;\r\nalso, for marking linen and paper, as well as for writing and drawing.\r\nThe writings and drawings made with these crayons can be effaced neither\r\nby water, by acids, nor by rubbing.\r\n\r\n\"Concerning the technical process for the production of ceresine, it\r\nshould be said that, when the industry was new (the production of\r\nceresine has been known only about eight years, since 1874), it was\r\ncontrolled by patents, which are kept secret. This much is known, that\r\nthe color and odor are removed by fuming sulphuric acid.\r\n\r\n\"From mineral wax of good quality about 70 per cent. of white ceresine\r\nis obtained. The yellow ceresine is tinted by the addition of coloring\r\nmatter (annatto).\r\n\r\n\"(b.) _Paraffine_, a firm, white, translucent substance, without odor.\r\nIt is used, chiefly, in the manufacture of candles, and also as a\r\nprotection against the action of acids, and to make casks and other\r\nwooden vessels water-tight, for coating corks, etc., for air-tight\r\nwrappings, and, finally, for the preparation of tracing paper. There\r\nare several methods of obtaining paraffine from ozokerite (see the\r\nEncyclopedic Handbook of Chemistry, by Benno Karl and F. Strohmann, vol.\r\niv., Brunswick, 1877).\r\n\r\n\"The details of the technical process consists, in every case, in the\r\ndistillation of the crude material, pressure of the distillate by\r\nhydraulic presses, melting, and treating by sulphuric acid.\r\n\r\n\"In the manufacture of paraffine from ozokerite, there are produced from\r\n2 to 8 per cent. of benzine, from 15 to 20 per cent. of naphtha, 36\r\nto 50 per cent. of paraffine, 15 to 20 per cent. of heavy oil for\r\nlubricating, and 10 to 20 per cent. of coke, as a residue.\r\n\r\n\"(c.) _Mineral oils_, which are obtained at the same time with\r\nparaffine, and are the same as those produced from crude petroleum,\r\ndescribed above. The process consists, as in the natural rock oils,\r\nbesides the distillation, in the treatment of the incidental products\r\nwith acids and alkalies.\r\n\r\n\"Of the products of ozokerite, manufactured in Galicia, the greater part\r\ngoes to Russia, Roumania, Turkey, Italy, and Upper Hungary. The common\r\nparaffine candles made in Galicia--which are of various sizes, from\r\n28 to 160 per kilo--are used by the Jews in all Galicia, Bukowuina,\r\nRoumania, Upper Hungary, and Southern Russia, and form an important\r\narticle of commerce. Ceresine is exported to all the ports of the world.\r\nOf late a considerable quantity is said to have been sent to the East\r\nIndies, where it is used in the printing of cotton.\"\r\n\r\nThe President, Dr. J. S. Newberry, stated that ozokerite was undoubtedly\r\na product of petroleum. Little was known by the public concerning its\r\nuse and value. He exhibited specimens of natural brown ozokerite, of\r\nyellow ozokerite, sold as beeswax, and of a white purified form, which\r\nhad been treated by sulphuric acid. Specimens from Utah had already been\r\nshown before the Academy. There was no mystery as to its genesis in\r\neither region, as it had been shown to be the result of inspissation of\r\na thick and viscid variety of petroleum. The term \"petroleum\" includes a\r\ngreat variety of substances, from a limpid liquid, too light to burn,\r\nto one that is thick and tarry. These differ widely also in chemical\r\ncomposition: some yielding much asphalt by distillation, resembling a\r\nsolution of asphalt in turpentine; some containing so much paraffine\r\nthat a considerable quantity can be strained out in cold weather. The\r\nasphalt in its natural form is a solid rock, to which the term \"gum\r\nbeds\" has been applied in Canada. These differences in constitution have\r\noriginated in the differences in the bituminous shales from which the\r\npetroleum, ozokerite, etc., have been derived. In Canada, as excavations\r\nare sunk through the asphalt, this becomes softer and softer, and\r\nfinally passes into petroleum. This is also the case in Utah.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Concluded from SUPPLEMENT No. 400, page 6390.]\r\n\r\n[KANSAS CITY REVIEW.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SOLAR ECLIPSE OF MAY 6, 1883.\r\n\r\n\r\nProfessor C.

The\r\nproducts of this country are fruits and photographs of the young women.\r\nThe party enjoyed both eating the former and bringing the latter home\r\nfor the admiration of their friends. The expedition really began at\r\nCallao, where the party embarked on the United States man-of-war\r\nHartford. Few circumstances contributed more to the enjoyment of the\r\ntrip than the lucky chance which threw this vessel in their way. The\r\nHartford was fitted out last August as flag ship of the South Pacific\r\nsquadron. The admiral had not yet removed his flag to the vessel, but\r\nthe extra accommodations provided for him and his train condoned the\r\ndignity lost by his absence. On March 22 they weighed anchor for a sail\r\nof more than four thousand miles over the blue ocean which stretches\r\nbetween Callao and their destination, Caroline Island. The southeast\r\ntrade winds favored them, and from the first day there was actually no\r\nnecessity for altering the position of a sail....\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants--five men, one woman and two children, according to\r\nthe eclipse census--are natives of Tahiti. The houses are one story\r\nstructures with clapboard sides, probably cut out in California and\r\nbrought out in ships, to be erected on this island. The island on which\r\nthey are built is about three-fourths of a mile in diameter and nearly\r\ncircular in outline. The edge, which rises from five to twenty inches\r\nfrom the water, according to the tide's phase, goes down under the water\r\nto an even table of coral running out many feet into the sea; and is\r\nimpossible to step on it with bare feet. At the end of this table the\r\nreef goes down perpendicularly, a sheer precipice, into the unfathomable\r\nsea. No vessel can anchor here, and to make a landing was an exciting\r\nmatter. The island was approached in small boats on the side sheltered\r\nfrom the wind, and here, with the luck which characterized the trip, was\r\nfound the only opening in this barrier of coral. A long cleft, perhaps\r\neight feet wide, at the outer edge of the reef, ran in, narrowing to a\r\nmere crack near the shore. Watching a favorable chance, the boats were\r\nguided through the surf into a cleft as far as shoal water, when the\r\nmen jumped on to the reef and carried baggage and instruments ashore as\r\nquickly as possible. The boats, which were new when they entered the\r\nsurf, came out much the worse for wear, and the boat in which Dr.\r\nHastings landed was stove in. Once on shore, life became a succession of\r\nwonders, rivaling the tales of Gulliver, and needing the conscientious\r\ndescriptions of exact scientists to make them credible.\r\n\r\nThe members of the observing party took up their abode in the larger of\r\nthe three houses, sleeping in swinging cots slung from the verandas,\r\nwhich afforded shade on three sides of the building. The second house\r\nwas occupied by the sailors, while the third was left to the natives.\r\nThese latter were sufficiently conversant with English to serve as\r\nexcellent guides. Each day the party bathed in a lagoon in the center of\r\nthe island. This lagoon was bordered by a beach of dazzling white coral\r\nsand, and all through its water extended reefs of living coral of\r\nthe more delicate and elaborate kinds. These corals gave the lake a\r\nwonderful variety of colors, forming a picture impossible to paint or\r\ndescribe, and with the least ripple from a passing breeze the whole\r\nscene changed to new groups of color. The water was very clear, and\r\nin some places deep; in others so filled with coral that a boat could\r\nbarely skim over the surface without scraping the keel. After crossing a\r\nlong reef, one day, they entered on a sheet of water so deep that their\r\nlongest line would not reach the bottom, plainly visible beneath. Fish\r\nswarmed here, and it was characteristic of them that every species, if\r\nnot brilliantly colored, was marked in the most peculiar manner. One\r\nvariety which frequented the shallow water, where it was heated to the\r\ndegree uncomfortable to the touch, was a pure milky white, with black\r\neyes, fins, and tail.\r\n\r\nThe French party arrived two days after the Americans. They had steamed\r\ndirectly from Panama with the hope of anticipating the Americans.\r\n\r\nIt rained on the morning of the eclipse, but cleared off in good time,\r\nand the definition was particularly good. Photographs occupied the time\r\nof the English and French observers. Professor Holden and Dr. Dickson\r\nsearched for intra-mercurial planets; Mr. Preston took the times of\r\ncontact; Dr. Hastings and Mr. Rockwell devoted their attention to\r\nspectroscopic observations of the corona. Dr. Hastings' observations\r\nhave led to the production of a new theory of the corona. Briefly\r\nstated, the theory is that the light seen around the sun during a total\r\neclipse is not due to a material substance enveloping the sun, but is a\r\nphenomenon of diffraction.\r\n\r\nFrom his observation during the eclipse of 1878, made at Central City,\r\nDr. Hastings conceived the first idea of this explanation of the solar\r\ncorona. Further study served to convince him of the truth of this\r\ntheory, but he had no means of proving it. Before the present eclipse,\r\nhowever, he devised a crucial test of his theory. This test is based on\r\nthe following already known phenomena: When the moon covers the face of\r\nthe sun, an envelope of light is seen all round it; the envelope is\r\nnot visible when the sun is shining, on account of the sun's greater\r\nbrightness; this light is called the corona; it is extremely irregular\r\nin outline. According to the drawing of Mr. J. E. Keeler at the eclipse\r\nof 1878, it enveloped the sun as a hazy glow, extending for a distance\r\nof several minutes of arc from the sun's limb and at two nearly opposite\r\npoints is extended out in two long streamers feathering off into space.\r\nThe opinion has been that this light was due to an atmosphere extending\r\nmillions of miles from the sun. According to Dr. Hastings' view, it must\r\nbe light from the sun which has undergone refraction, i.e., which has\r\nbeen bent from its regular course by the interposition of an opaque body\r\nlike the moon.\r\n\r\nIn order to make this perfectly plain, suppose the front of a surface\r\nof waves of any sort to be striking an object which resists them. If\r\nan organ of sense is placed in the resisting object, it will judge the\r\ndirection of the waves or the direction of the object producing them by\r\na line at right angles with the wave front. Now suppose a body is placed\r\nbetween the body producing the waves and the sensitive organ. The waves\r\nmust go around this body and will produce an eddy behind it, so that the\r\nwave front will have a different direction, and the organ of sense will\r\nconceive the origin of the waves to lie in a direction different from\r\nthat before the body was interposed. Now consider the waves to be waves\r\nof light, and their origin the sun. The organ of sense is the retina of\r\nthe eye. The moon is the opaque body interposed in the course of the\r\nwaves, and they, being bent, make the impression on the eye that the\r\nlight comes from beyond the edge of the sun. The moon covers the sun\r\nduring the eclipse and a little more, so that it can move for about five\r\nminutes and still cover the sun entirely. This movement is very slight,\r\nand if the corona consists of light from a solar atmosphere, it should\r\nnot change at all during this movement of the moon. But if diffraction\r\nis the cause of the light, then the slightest change in the relative\r\npositions of the sun and the moon should change the configuration of the\r\ncorona, i.e., the corona should not remain exactly the same during\r\na total eclipse. The character of the light as shown by a spectrum\r\nanalysis should change.\r\n\r\nTo determine this point Dr. Hastings invented the following instrument:\r\nTwo lozenge-shaped prisms of glass were fastened in the form of a letter\r\nV, and so arranged that all the light falling within the aperture of\r\nthe V was lost, and that falling on the ends of the glass prisms was\r\ntransmitted by a series of reflections to the apex of the V, where the\r\nprisms touched; here was placed a refracting prism, so that the light\r\ncould be analyzed. This instrument was attached to the eye piece of the\r\ntelescope, and the image of the eclipse reduced to such a size that the\r\nmoon just fitted into the aperture of the V, while opposite sides of the\r\ncorona were reflected through the prisms to the place where they came\r\ntogether. In this way both sides of the corona were seen through the\r\neye-piece at the same time. On looking at the eclipse this is what Dr.\r\nHastings saw: The light of the corona was divided into its constituents.\r\nProminent among them was a bright green line, which is designated by the\r\nnumber 1,474; to this line attention was directed. Its presence in the\r\nspectrum has been an argument in favor of the view that the corona is\r\na solar atmosphere. If this is the case, the line should remain fixed\r\nduring the eclipse; but if the corona is due to diffraction, this line\r\nshould change. It should grow shorter in the light from one side of the\r\ncorona, and longer on the other. The observation was now reduced to\r\nwatching for a change in the relative length of two green lines.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of totality the line from the west side was much the\r\nlonger, but as the eclipse progressed it shortened notably, while the\r\nline from the east side, shorter by about one-third at the beginning of\r\nthe eclipse, grew longer. When the eclipse ended, the proportions of the\r\nlines were exactly reversed. There had been a change equal to two-thirds\r\nthe length of the lines, while the sun and moon had only changed their\r\nrelative positions by an extremely small amount. The only way in which\r\nthis phenomenon can be accounted for is on the diffraction theory. The\r\nmaterial view of the corona will not answer for it. But there are other\r\ndiscrepancies in the older view which have been known for some time.\r\nThe principal ones are: 1. It is known from study of the sun that the\r\ngaseous pressure at the surface must be less than an inch of mercury,\r\nand is probably less than one-tenth of an inch, but an atmosphere\r\nextending to the supposed limits would cause an enormous pressure at the\r\nsun's surface, especially since the force of gravity on the sun is very\r\nmuch greater than on the earth. 2. The laws of gravitation would require\r\na solar atmosphere to be distributed symmetrically around the sun, while\r\nthe corona is enormously irregular in form. The sun is irregular in\r\noutline, which would make its diffracted phenomena show the observed\r\nirregularity, but it is symmetrical as regards density. 3. The most\r\ninteresting discrepancy of the theory of the solar atmosphere is the\r\nfact that while it is supposed to extend for millions of miles from the\r\nsun, the recent comet passed within two hundred thousand miles of the\r\nsun, and yet its orbit was not affected in the least, as it would have\r\nbeen if it had plowed its way through a material substance. In taking\r\nphotographs of the corona it is seen to be larger as the time of\r\nexposure is longer. This shows that the corona extends indefinitely, and\r\nit decreases in brilliancy in exact accordance with the mathematical\r\nlaws of diffraction. These laws involve very complicated mathematics,\r\nbut by them alone Dr. Hastings has proved that there must be diffraction\r\nwhere the corona is, and that it must follow the same laws as those\r\nobserved. There is a small envelope around the sun, but in the opinion\r\nof Dr. Hastings it does not extend beyond what is known as the\r\nchromosphere.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe question seems to be settled, with considerable certainty, that\r\nnothing exists inside of Mercury large enough to be dignified by\r\nthe name of planet. There may be, and there probably are, for the\r\nperturbations of Mercury indicate it, multitudes of small masses\r\ncirculating around the sun like the planets, being fragments of comets\r\nor condensations of primitive matter, whose combined luster is seen in\r\nthe zodiacal light.\r\n\r\nThe other results of the work of the Commission, so far as now known,\r\nare connected with the structure of the corona, the solar appendage\r\nwhich extends out for millions of miles from the sun's disk. In the\r\nphotographs of the Egyptian eclipse of last summer these streamers can\r\nbe traced back of each other where they cross; no better proof of their\r\nextreme tenuity could be given.\r\n\r\nThe duration of an eclipse of the sun depends on three things, the\r\ndistance of the sun from the earth, the distance of the moon from the\r\nearth, and the distance of the station from the equator. All of these\r\nwere favorable to a long eclipse in the case of the recent one, and the\r\nsix minutes of totality gave opportunities for deliberate work not often\r\nenjoyed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA BURIED CITY OF THE EXODUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe excavations at Tell-el-Maskhutah, of which illustrations are given,\r\nhave resulted in some of the most interesting and important discoveries\r\nthat have ever rewarded the labors of archæologists. The idea of\r\nfounding an English society for the purpose of exploring the buried\r\ncities of the Delta originated with Miss A. B. Edwards, the well-known\r\nauthoress of \"One Thousand Miles up the Nile,\" and was carried into\r\neffect mainly by her own efforts and the energy and zeal of Mr. Reginald\r\nStuart Poole, of the British Museum, aided by the substantial support of\r\nSir Erasmus Wilson, without whose munificent donations the work could\r\nnever have been accomplished. The \"Egypt Exploration Fund,\" thus founded\r\nand maintained, was fortunate in securing the co-operation of M.\r\nNaville, the distinguished Swiss Egyptologist, who set out for Egypt\r\nin January of this year with the object of conducting the explorations\r\ncontemplated by the society. After a consultation with M. Maspero, the\r\nDirector of Archæology in Egypt, who has throughout acted a friendly\r\npart toward the society's enterprise, M. Naville decided to begin his\r\ncampaign by attacking the mounds at Tell-el-Maskhutah, on the Freshwater\r\nCanal, a few miles from Ismailia. The mounds of earth here were known to\r\ncover some ancient city, for some sphinxes and statues had already\r\nbeen found; but what city it could be, archæologists were at a loss to\r\ndetermine; though some, with Professor Lepsius at their head, believed\r\nit to be none other than the Rameses or \"Raamses,\" which the Children of\r\nIsrael built for Pharaoh, and whence they started on their final Exodus.\r\nAny identification, however, of the sites of the Biblical cities in\r\nEgypt was so far merely speculative. Practically nothing definite was\r\nknown as to the geography of the Israelite sojourn, except that the Land\r\nof Goshen was undoubtedly in the eastern part of the Delta, and that\r\nZoan was Tanis, whose immense mounds are to form the next subject of\r\nthe society's operations. The route of the Exodus was as uncertain as\r\neverything else connected with Israel's sojourn in Egypt. What sea they\r\ncrossed, and where, and by what direction they journeyed to it, remained\r\nvexed questions, although Dr. Brugsch had set up a plausible theory, in\r\nwhich the \"Serbonian Bog\" played an important part.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE EXCAVATIONS PITHOM-SUCCOTH]\r\n\r\nSix weeks of steady digging at Tell-el-Maskhutah, under M. Naville's\r\nskillful direction, placed all these speculations in quite a new light.\r\nThe city under the mounds proved to be none other than Pithom, the\r\n\"store\" or \"treasure city\" which the Children of Israel \"built for\r\nPharaoh\" (Exod. i. 11). Its character as a store place or granary is\r\nseen in its construction; for the greater part of the area is covered\r\nwith strongly built chambers, without doors, suitable for the storing of\r\ngrain, which would be introduced through trap doors in the floor\r\nabove, of which the ends of the beams are still visible. These curious\r\nchambers, unique in their appearance, are constructed of large, well\r\nmade bricks, sometimes mixed with straw, sometimes without it, dried in\r\nthe sun, and laid with mortar, with great regularity and precision. The\r\nwalls are 10 ft. thick, and the thickness of the inclosing wall which\r\nruns round the whole city is more than 20 ft. In one corner was the\r\ntemple, dedicated to the god Tum, and hence called Pe-tum or Pithom, the\r\n\"Abode of Tum.\" Only a few statues, groups, and tablets (some of which\r\nhave been presented to the British Museum) remained to testify to its\r\nname and purpose; the temple itself was finally destroyed when the\r\nRomans turned Pithom into a camp, as is shown by the position of the\r\nlimestone fragments and of the Roman bricks. The statues, however, and\r\nespecially a large stele, are extremely valuable, since they tell the\r\nhistory of the city during eighteen centuries. From a study of these\r\nmonuments, M. Naville has learned that Pithom was its sacred, and Thukut\r\n(Succoth) its civil, name; that it was founded by Rameses II., restored\r\nby Shishak and others of the twenty-second dynasty; was an important\r\nplace under the Ptolemies, who set up a great stele to commemorate the\r\nfounding of the city of Arsinoë in the neighborhood; was called Hero or\r\nHeroöpolis by the Greeks (a name derived from the hieroglyphic _ara_,\r\nmeaning a \"store house\"), and Ero Castra by the Romans, who occupied it\r\nat all events as late as A.D. 306. Indications are also found of the\r\nposition of Pihahiroth, where the Israelites encamped before the\r\npassage of the \"Reedy Sea,\" and of Clysma. All these data are directly\r\ncontradictory to preconceived theories: Pithom, Succoth, Heroöpolis,\r\nPihahiroth, and Clysma had all been hypothetically placed in totally\r\ndifferent positions. The identification of Pithom with Succoth gives us\r\nthe first absolutely certain point as yet established in the route of\r\nthe Exodus, and completely overthrows Dr. Brugsch's theory. It is now\r\ncertain that the Israelites passed along the valley of the Freshwater\r\nCanal and not near the Mediterranean and Lake Serbonis. The first\r\ndefinite geographical fact in connection with the sojourn in the Land of\r\nEgypt has been established by the excavations at Pithom. The historical\r\nidentification of Rameses II. with Pharaoh the oppressor also results\r\nfrom the monumental evidence. One short exploration has upset a hundred\r\ntheories and furnished a wonderful illustration of the historical\r\ncharacter of the Book of Exodus. The finding of Pithom (Succoth)\r\nis, however, only the beginning, we hope, of a series of important\r\ndiscoveries. When enough money has been collected for the proposed\r\nexploration of Zoan (Tanis), results of the highest interest to students\r\nalike of the Bible and of Egyptian antiquities may, with certainty, be\r\npredicted.\r\n\r\nThe uppermost view shows a portion of the diggings; a workman is\r\nbringing up a barrow-load of soil from one of the deep store chambers\r\nwhich the Children of Israel built more than three thousand years ago.\r\nIn the foreground lie the fragments of a fallen granite statue, the head\r\nand face of which are intact. The other illustration is taken from the\r\ntemple end of the excavations. The sculptured group of Rameses the Great\r\nseated between divinities is one of a pair that adorned the entrance;\r\nits companion and the sphinxes that guarded the pylon are at Ismailia.\r\nBeyond this group, and a little to the left, is seen the great Stele of\r\nPithom, set up by Ptolemy Philadelphus and Arsinoë, and containing a\r\nmass of important information in its long hieroglyphic inscriptions.\r\nBehind this, and on either side, the massive brick walls of the store\r\nchambers and the inclosing wall of the temple can be traced; while on\r\nthe right hand, in the middle distance, is a heap of limestone blocks,\r\nalready collected by Rameses II. for the completion or enlargement of\r\nthe temple. The excavations were photographed for M. Naville, by Herr\r\nEmil Brugsch, of the Boulak Museum, and our illustrations are taken from\r\nthese photographs, supplemented by sketches.--_S.L.P., in Illustrated\r\nLondon News_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MOABITE MANUSCRIPTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe surprises of archæology are magnificent and apparently\r\ninexhaustible. It is continually bringing forth things new and old, and\r\noften it happens that the newest are the oldest of all. Whether this\r\nor the exact converse is the case in regard to the latest discovery of\r\nBiblical archæology is a question not to be determined offhand; but the\r\ninterest and importance of the question can hardly be overrated. There\r\nare now deposited in the British Museum fifteen leather slips, on the\r\nforty folds of which are written portions of the Book of Deuteronomy\r\nin a recension entirely different from that of the received text. The\r\ncharacter employed in the manuscript is similar to that of the famous\r\nMoabite stone and of the Siloam inscription, and, therefore, the mere\r\npalæographical indication should give the probable date of the slips as\r\nthe ninth century B. C., or sixteen centuries earlier than any other\r\nclearly authenticated manuscript of any portion of the Old Testament.\r\nThe sheepskin slips are literally black with age, and are impregnated\r\nwith a faint odor as of funeral spices; the folds are from 6 to 7 inches\r\nlong and about 3½ inches wide, containing each about ten lines, written\r\nonly on one side.\r\n\r\nSo far as they have yet been deciphered, they exhibit two distinct\r\nhandwritings, though the same archaic character is used throughout.\r\nIn some cases the same passages of Deuteronomy occur in duplicate on\r\ndistinct slips, as though the fragments belonged to two contemporary\r\ntranscriptions made by different scribes from the same original text. At\r\nfirst sight no writing whatever is perceptible; the surface seems to\r\nbe covered with an oily or glutinous substance, which so completely\r\nobscures the writing beneath that a photograph of some of the\r\nslips--which we have had an opportunity of examining side by side with\r\nthe slips themselves--exhibits no trace of the text. But when the\r\nleather is moistened with spirits of wine the letters become momentarily\r\nvisible beneath the glossy surface.\r\n\r\nThese extraordinary fragments were brought to England by Mr. Shapira,\r\nof Jerusalem, a well known bookseller and dealer in antiquities.\r\nMr. Shapira's name will be remembered in connection with certain\r\narchæological problems which have been solved by some scholars in a\r\nmanner not altogether creditable to his sagacity.\r\n\r\nThe Moabite pottery which reached Europe through Mr. Shapira's agency\r\nand is deposited in the Museum at Berlin is now commonly regarded as a\r\nmodern forgery; but of this forgery, if it be one, it is asserted that\r\nMr. Shapira was the dupe and not the accomplice. The leathern fragments\r\nnow produced by Mr. Shapira were, as he alleges, obtained by him from\r\ncertain Arabs near Dibon, the neighborhood where the Moabite stone was\r\ndiscovered. The agent employed by him in their purchase was an Arab\r\n\"who would steal his mother-in-law for a few piastres,\" and who would\r\nprobably be even less scrupulous about a few blackened slips of ancient\r\nor modern sheepskin. The value placed by Mr. Shapira on the fragments\r\nis, however, a cool million sterling, and at this price they are offered\r\nto the British Museum, where they have been temporarily deposited for\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\nDr. Ginsburg, the well-known Semitic scholar--whose receipt of a grant\r\nof £500 from the Prime Minister toward the production of his important\r\nwork on the \"Massorah\" we announced with much satisfaction yesterday--is\r\nnow busily engaged in deciphering the contents of the fragments and\r\nexamining their genuineness. On this latter question we refrain from\r\npronouncing an opinion. When Dr. Ginsburg's report appears, we shall be\r\nable to judge whether these extraordinary fragments are really 2,500\r\nyears old, or have been compiled within the last few years.\r\n\r\nNo complete account of the contents of the fragments can yet be given.\r\nTo decipher them is a work of time and of infinite patience and skill,\r\nas will readily be inferred from the account we have given above of the\r\nappearance and condition of the slips. But enough has been deciphered to\r\nshow that the text employed in them exhibits discrepancies of the most\r\nremarkable and important character as compared with that of the received\r\nversion of the Mosaic books.\r\n\r\nIn the first verse of the ninth chapter of Deuteronomy, where the\r\nreceived version reads, \"Thou art to pass over Jordan this day, to go in\r\nto possess nations greater and mightier than thyself,\" the corresponding\r\npassage of the fragments substitutes the plural for the singular, \"Ye\"\r\nfor '\"Thou,\" while for \"_g'dôlîm_,\" the word translated \"greater,\" it\r\nreads \"_rabbîm_.\" But a far more complete idea of the variations of text\r\nand signification may be obtained from a comparison of the text of the\r\nDecalogue as it appears in the received version in the sixth chapter of\r\nDeuteronomy with that contained in the fragments so far as they have yet\r\nbeen deciphered. The version of the fragments, literally rendered, runs\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n\"I am God, thy God, which liberated thee from the land of Egypt, from\r\nthe house of bondage. Ye shall have no other gods. Ye shall not make to\r\nyourselves any graven image, nor any likeness that is in heaven above or\r\nthat is in the earth beneath, or that is in the waters under the earth.\r\nYe shall not bow down to them nor serve them. I am God, your God.\r\nSanctify ... in six days I have made the heaven and the earth, and all\r\nthat is therein, and rested on the seventh day, therefore rest thou\r\nalso, thou and thy cattle and all that thou hast: I am God, thy God.\r\nHonor thy father and thy mother ...: I am God, thy God. Thou shall not\r\nkill the person of thy brother: I am God, thy God. Thou shalt not commit\r\nadultery with the wife of thy neighbor: I am God, thy God. Thou shalt\r\nnot steal the property of thy brother: I am God, thy God. Thou shalt not\r\nswear by my name falsely, for I visit the iniquity of the fathers upon\r\nthe children unto the third and fourth generation of those who take\r\nmy name in vain: I am God, thy God. Thou shalt not bear false witness\r\nagainst thy brother: I am God, thy God. Thou shalt not covet the wife\r\n... or his manservant, or his maidservant, or anything that is his: I am\r\nGod, thy God. Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thy heart: I am God,\r\nthy God. These ten words (or commandments) God spake.\"\r\n\r\nSeveral points may be noted in this version. The singular refrain \"I\r\nam God, thy God\"--which does not appear at all in the received\r\nversion--occurs ten times, being, as it were, a solemn ratification of\r\nthe Divine sanction given at the end of each separate precept. If this\r\nbe so, the first two commandments, as they are commonly reckoned, are\r\nhere fused into one, and the tenth place is taken by a commandment which\r\ndoes not appear in the received version of the Decalogue.\r\n\r\nIt will further be observed that the distinctive Jewish name for the\r\nAlmighty, \"Jehovah,\" or \"the Lord,\" does not appear at all, the familiar\r\nphrase of the received version, \"the Lord thy God,\" being replaced\r\nthroughout by \"God, thy God.\"\r\n\r\nOn the many variations in arrangement and detail we need not dwell;\r\nthey speak for themselves. But we have quoted enough to show that these\r\nfragments present problems of the utmost importance and interest both to\r\ncriticism and exegesis, unless, indeed, they are to be regarded as\r\nthe ingenious fabrications of some Oriental Ireland, who, knowing the\r\ninterest felt by scholars in variations of the Sacred Text, has set\r\nhimself, with infinite pains and skill, to forestall a growing demand.\r\nUntil this preliminary question is resolved to the satisfaction of all\r\ncompetent scholars, no further questions need be raised. In any case\r\nthe _primá facie_ presumption must be held to be enormously against\r\nthe genuineness of the fragments. Such a presumption rests on the\r\nimprobability of finding manuscripts older by at least sixteen centuries\r\nthan any extant manuscripts of the same text, on the comparative ease\r\nwith which such fragments can be forged, and on the powerful motives\r\nto such forgery attested by the price placed by Mr. Shapira on his\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\nAll that we know of the _provenance_ of the fragments is that Mr.\r\nShapira obtained them from an Arab of doubtful character; and that\r\nArabs of doubtful character have driven a splendid trade in Moabite\r\nantiquities ever since the discovery of the Moabite stone. On the other\r\nhand, the forger, if forgery there be, is assuredly no clumsy and\r\nignorant bungler, as the makers of the Moabite pottery were confidently\r\nalleged to be by those who disputed its genuineness. It is, of course,\r\npart of his craft, and not, perhaps, much more than the 'prentice part,\r\nto give to the sheepskins on which the text is inscribed an appearance\r\nof immemorial antiquity. But a good deal more than the skill required to\r\nmake a new sheepskin look like an old one has gone to the production of\r\nMr. Shapira's fragments. If they are forged, the fabricator must have\r\nknown what scholars would be likely to expect in genuine fragments,\r\nand have set himself to fulfill their expectations. In these days of\r\nscientific palæography and minute textual scholarship no forger of\r\nancient manuscripts could hope to take in scholars unless he were a\r\nscholar himself. Variations of text would be looked for as a matter of\r\ncourse; palæographical accuracy would be exacted to the minutest turn\r\nof a letter. Now, to vary a text so as to furnish a different recension\r\nwithout betraying ignorance or solecism requires scholarship of no mean\r\norder, while it is very far from an easy thing to write currently in an\r\narchaic and unfamiliar character in such a manner as to deceive experts\r\nin palæography. But the fabricator of these fragments, if fabricated\r\nthey are, has attempted and accomplished a good deal more than this.\r\nHe has in some cases produced two identical texts written in different\r\nhands, both preserving unimpaired the archaic character of the letters.\r\nThis implies either the employment of two scribes or else an almost\r\nincredible skill in the single scribe employed, and in either case\r\nit doubles the probability of detection. If, moreover, the supposed\r\nfabricator is also himself the scribe, it is evident that he is not only\r\na very ingenious artist, but also a very accomplished scholar, and one\r\ncan only regret that he has engaged in an industry which has placed him\r\nat the mercy of an Arab who would steal his mother-in-law for a few\r\npiastres, and is likely, therefore, to enrich no one but Mr. Shapira. We\r\nshould expect to find, however, that his extraordinary ingenuity has at\r\nsome point or another overreached itself. Familiar as he must be with\r\nthe labors of modern Biblical critics--for otherwise he would hardly\r\nhave ventured to impose upon them--it would be strange if he were not\r\nbetrayed into some more or less suspicious coincidences with them. In\r\nany case, the problem presented by the fragments is one of profound\r\ninterest, and the whole world of letters will resound with the\r\ncontroversy they are certain to excite.--_London Times_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SPECIMENS OF OLD KNOCKING DEVICES FOR DOORS.--_From the\r\nBuilding News_.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSHIPPING OSTRICHES FROM CAPE TOWN TO AUSTRALIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the failure last August of the Cape Commercial Bank there has been\r\nmuch depression in South Africa. Ostrich farming, in common with\r\nother enterprises, has suffered. Before the crisis a pair of breeding\r\nostriches have been sold for 350 l., now they would not realize 50 l.\r\n\r\nThe resolution of the Government of South Australia to encourage ostrich\r\nbreeding came in very opportunely for the Cape dealers, and one or two\r\ncargoes of birds have been shipped for Adelaide. The climate of the two\r\ncolonies is very similar, and the locality selected for the imported\r\nbirds (the Musgrave Ranges) resembles in dryness and temperature their\r\nnative _habitat_.\r\n\r\nThe first sketch opposite represents the ostriches bidding farewell\r\nto their South African home. \"The dear old farm where we were reared,\r\ngood-by!\"\r\n\r\nOne of the boxes, while being slung from the cart to the hold, got into\r\na slanting position. This frightened one of the two inmates, a fine\r\ncock. He kicked so hard that he burst open the door of his cage, which\r\nwas, of course, instantly lowered on deck. Fortunately there was there\r\na gentleman who understood how to handle ostriches. He instantly seized\r\nhim before he could do himself or the bystanders any injury, and after\r\na brief struggle prevailed on him to re-enter his box. When released in\r\nthe hold he became quite quiet, and ate his first meal on board ship\r\nwith a relish.\r\n\r\nAfter being taken out of their boxes the birds are allowed to take a\r\nlittle exercise just to make themselves at home, and are then arranged\r\nin wooden kraals, of which there are two hundred on board the vessel.\r\nThe ostriches are induced to move from one place to another by catching\r\nhold of their bodies, and using a little gentle force.\r\n\r\nThe last sketch represents their first meal on board after a fast of\r\nthirty hours. Apple melons were chopped up for them by their \"steward,\"\r\nwho was to accompany them to Australia. It was curious to see a bird\r\nswallow a great lump and then to watch the lump working slowly down\r\nthe animal's long neck. On the voyage they would be fed with maize or\r\nmealies, onions, apple melons, and barley. They require very little\r\nwater; however, there were five large iron tanks on board in case they\r\nwould feel thirsty.

Mr. Emile Richard, inspector of the Versailles\r\nwaterworks, has just devised an ingenious system which, while\r\nconsiderably reducing the weight of the movable part, allows the\r\nweathercock to preserve all its sensitiveness. This apparatus consists\r\nof two principal parts--one fixed and the other movable. The stationary\r\npart is designated in the accompanying figure by the letters A and B and\r\nby cross-hatchings. This forms the rod or support. An iron tube, T, with\r\nclamps, P, at its lower extremity forms the base of the apparatus, and\r\nis hidden, after the mounting of the apparatus, by the ornamental zinc\r\ncovering, Z. The upper part of the tube carries a shoulder-piece,\r\nupon which rests a bronze platform, E, and which is slightly inclined\r\noutwardly to prevent the accumulation of water on it. Over the platform\r\nthere move three crystal balls, which are held and guided by a\r\nhorizontal disk movable around the stationary tube.\r\n\r\nThe movable portion, designed to receive the action of the wind and to\r\nindicate its direction, is designated by the letters C D and coarse\r\nlines. It consists of (1) a zinc tube, K, provided at intervals with\r\ncopper rings, and entering the rod, A B, which serves as a guide for it;\r\n(2) of a bronze disk covered by an external ornament, O, fixed to the\r\ntube and resting on the balls; (3) of the vane, G, properly so called;\r\nand (4) of the cap, C, provided with bayonet catch, crowning the tube\r\nand covering the point of attachment of the wire of transmission.\r\nThis latter consists of a simple brass or galvanized iron wire, f f,\r\nperfectly taut, and made fast in the top of the tube. After traversing\r\nas many stories as necessary this wire terminates, in the interior of\r\nthe room where the observations are made, in a copper rod to which is\r\nfastened a horizontal arrow, F. The wire traverses the floorings through\r\nsmall zinc tubes; and, in the rooms through which it passes, it is\r\nprotected by iron tubes. To the ceiling of the observing room there is\r\naffixed a wind-rose, R, on which the arrow reproduces all the motions of\r\nthe vane.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RICHARD'S WEATHERCOCK.]\r\n\r\nThis apparatus is now in operation in the different stations that the\r\nVersailles waterworks has established near the reservoirs of the plateau\r\nof Trappes, and it is also installed in several primary normal schools,\r\nwhere it is giving very good results.--_La Nature_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARRED CLOVER.\r\n\r\n\r\nA correspondent of the _Ohio Farmer_ reports an experiment in curing\r\nclover, showing how he just missed breeding fire in his barn, and\r\nillustrating the importance of ventilating hay mows:\r\n\r\nIn 1861 I used a horse fork for the first time. The haying season was\r\nnot a bright one, and our clover was drawn a little greener than usual,\r\nand went into the mow in large and compact forkfuls. The result was\r\nintense heating, and consequently very rapid evaporation and sweating of\r\nthe mow. On a bay holding ordinarily twenty tons we put at least thirty\r\ntons, as every load at the top seemed to make room for another. The barn\r\nwas rather open, which allowed quite free evaporation on all sides as\r\nwell as at the top. The result was that I had very bright and excellent\r\nhay at the bottom, top, and sides of that mow, but severals tons in the\r\ncenter were as completely charred as though burned in a coal pit. What\r\nprevented combustion has always been a mystery to me. Since that escape\r\nfrom a conflagration, I have not deemed it prudent to put clover in so\r\ngreen as to cause intense heating, or to fill a mow too rapidly. If we\r\nhaul six loads per day to one mow, weighing thirty hundred each, which\r\nwill shrink during the sweating process to one ton each, we have three\r\ntons of water to be thrown off by evaporation.\r\n\r\nIf we continue to put on six loads per day until the mow is full, the\r\nprincipal part of that moisture must rise through the entire mass. To\r\nrelieve the hay of moisture, I deem it best to have several places of\r\nstorage, and change daily or semi-daily from one to the other, thus\r\ngiving time for a share of the moisture to pass off. To facilitate this\r\nevaporation and prevent the hay from reabsorbing it and becoming musty,\r\nthe best of ventilation is necessary. Ventilation above a clover mow is\r\nas necessary as it is above a sugar or fruit evaporator. If there is\r\nnot open space and draught sufficient to carry away the moisture, it is\r\nreturned to the mow, and mould is the inevitable result. No ordinary\r\namount of drying will prevent hay from becoming musty if ventilation is\r\nshut off during the sweating process. If a hole is cut through the floor\r\nat the bottom of the mow near the center and under a ventilator in the\r\nroof and a barrel placed over it and drawn up as the hay is mowed in,\r\nthus leaving a hole from bottom to top, evaporation will be facilitated\r\nand the quality of the hay improved. Salt thrown on, as the clover is\r\nput in, to the amount of two or three quarts to the ton, will make it a\r\nrelish with stock.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE QUEEN VICTORIA CENTURY PLANT.\r\n\r\n(_Agave victoriæ-reginæ_.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis beautiful Agave is now in blossom in the garden here, and I am\r\nhappy to be able to send you photographs of it. This is the first time\r\nit has ever blossomed in cultivation, and it has never been seen in\r\nflower in a wild state. It is a mature native-grown specimen, dense in\r\nhabit, and perfectly semi-spherical in form, and the leaves are arranged\r\nin spiral fashion with as much regularity as those of a screw pine. The\r\ncircumference of the plant is 5 ft. 1 in., and it has 268 leaves. Its\r\nflower-stem appeared about the middle of June, grew rather fast till it\r\nwas 7 ft. high, then rather slowly till it reached its full development.\r\nThe scape is now 10 ft. 4 in. high above the plant, 6½ in. in\r\ncircumference at the base, or 5¼ in. at a foot above the base; from\r\nthere it tapers very gradually till near the apex. The flower-spike is\r\nexceedingly dense, and 5 ft. 8 in. long; the lower or naked portion, 4\r\nft. 8 in. long, is prominently marked by abortive flower buds, with,\r\nnear the base, some bristle-like scales 3½ in. to 4 in. long. The\r\nflowers are regularly arranged in parcels of three, all the three being\r\nequal in size and opening together; they are greenish white in color, 1½\r\nin. long, or, including the stamens, some 2¾ in. to 3 in. long.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AGAVE VICTORIÆ-REGINÆ.]\r\n\r\nThe first flowers opened on August 3, and they have continued to open\r\nin succession, a belt about 3 in. wide opening each day. They remain in\r\ngood condition for two days; on the third day the stamens wilt and drop\r\ndown, but the pistil remains erect till the fourth day. On the first day\r\nof opening the pistil is not so long as the stamens by ¾ in.; on the\r\nsecond it has grown to be as long as the stamens, but it is not in\r\ncondition to receive the pollen till after noon of the second day.\r\nAlthough the flowers on some eighteen inches of the spike have already\r\nblossomed, none of the ovaries have been fertilized; they are dropping\r\noff, but I am rather sanguine regarding those about the middle of the\r\nspike. So great is the superfluity of nectar contained in the flowers,\r\nthat on the afternoon of the second day it often drops from the cups,\r\nand the least shake to the scape brings it down in a shower. The main\r\nbeauty of the inflorescence consists in the dense bottle-brush-like mass\r\nof bright yellow anthers. This plant, together with several smaller\r\nones, was contributed to this garden by Dr. Edward Palmer, who collected\r\nthem in their native wilds--the mountains of Northern Mexico--some three\r\nyears ago. He found them growing in a limited and rather inaccessible\r\nlocality in gravelly and rocky soil some miles from Monterey. In\r\naddition to those he sent here he also sent a quantity to the garden of\r\nthe Agricultural Department at Washington, and some to Dr. Engelmann,\r\nthe eminent botanist at St. Louis. To Dr. Engelmann he also sent a piece\r\nof an old flower stem and some dried capsules which he found upon an\r\nold plant, and it was from these specimens in 1880 that the doctor\r\nwas enabled to describe for the first time the inflorescence of this\r\nAgave.--_The Garden_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE CONSTITUTION OF THE NATURAL FATS.\r\n\r\nBy J.
