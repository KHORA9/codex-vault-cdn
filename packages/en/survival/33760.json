UDDEN\r\n\r\nAN INSTANCE OF THE PRACTICAL VALUE OF \"PURE SCIENCE\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe practical value of the service of the geological profession is, with\r\nevery year, being more and more appreciated, especially among people who\r\nare developing the mineral resources of our country. Nevertheless, we\r\nstill hear men who speak of geologists as theorists that render our\r\nprofitable industries but little assistance. It is true that much of the\r\nwork that geologists do has but a remote bearing on practical questions.\r\nThe fact is that in geology, as in other sciences, one can never know\r\nwhen a purely scientific observation may turn out to have a practical\r\napplication. Paleontologists who study the minutest details of fossils\r\nhave been held up as impractical people, even though their science has\r\nmore than once proved to be of the greatest practical importance for the\r\nfinding of valuable natural deposits. Certainly those who have been most\r\nprominent in the promotion of paleontology as a science have seldom, if\r\never, had any economic motive in the pursuit of their work. I think the\r\nsame is true of our leading petrographers. I believe that the men who\r\nhave advanced the science of geology most, have seldom contributed much\r\nto the practical application of the principles they have discovered.\r\nMuch scientific work naturally appears unprofitable or useless to the\r\nuninitiated. I shall here relate a case that suggests how entirely wrong\r\nit may be to regard as of no economic value any geologic fact, however\r\ninsignificant it may appear.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1890 I took occasion to make a trip to the Black Hills\r\nin South Dakota in order to profit, as I could, by a few weeks' tramping\r\nin this interesting region. Going one day in a southwest direction from\r\nMinnekahta, to look for fossil cycads, I stumbled on a block of\r\nsandstone with a rather smooth surface on which were some peculiar\r\nmarkings, such as I had never seen figured or described. The rock was\r\nevidently a block from the Dakota sandstone. Its smooth upper surface,\r\nwhich represented a bedding plane, was covered with a thin coating of\r\nsilt or fine clay which adhered to the block. The markings were in this\r\nclay. They were straight, shallow grooves from one-half to two inches in\r\nlength, and from one-sixteenth to one-eighth inch in width. They were\r\njoined into patterns in which some sprang out from the sides of others\r\nand again themselves sent out other branches. Some crossed each other. I\r\nnoticed that there was a quite uniform angle of divergence in these\r\nbranches, and I was able to make out that this usual angle was about\r\nsixty degrees. I also noted that the grooves narrowed to sharp points.\r\nSomehow, immediately I concluded that the cracks were the result of ice\r\ncrystals, and I at once saw the propriety of frozen water having existed\r\nin an age during which deciduous trees began to appear. This was theory.\r\nWe have since that time learned to know that cold climates far antedate\r\nthe coming of the dicotyledons.\r\n\r\nAs I had no suitable photographic equipment, I took pains to make\r\naccurate drawings of a part of the pattern as it appeared on the rock.\r\nMy original drawing is shown in Plate I. A brief description of these\r\nmarkings was later furnished in the Scientific American, of February 19,\r\n1895.\r\n\r\nIt took me some years to find any similar markings again. In the early\r\nspring of 1903 I had occasion to make a visit to Mexico, when I spent a\r\nhalf day in Ojinaga, which is a little village south of Presidio, in\r\nTexas, on the Mexican side of the river. Some sidewalks in this little\r\nvillage are built of flags of limestone belonging to the Eagle Ford\r\nformation. To my great delight I found some of these slabs having\r\nprecisely the same kind of markings that I had noted on the sandstone in\r\nDakota. Naturally I attached some importance to the fact that the Eagle\r\nFord corresponds quite closely in age to that of the Dakota sandstone.\r\nBoth were made at about the beginning of the upper Cretaceous age. I\r\nnoticed here a considerable variation in the closeness of the patterns\r\nof the markings. Occasionally they were found as separate single lines,\r\nseveral inches removed from each other; and on other rocks they would\r\nbe found crossing in close networks. In the summer of 1904 I again found\r\nmy ice markings on a layer of arenaceous limestone in the same formation\r\nin the Big Bend country in Texas. This time I collected some specimens\r\nwhich were subsequently photographed. One of these photographs is shown\r\nin Plate II. Again in 1906 I noticed the same markings on some thin\r\nsandy flags which occur in the Del Rio clay near the city of Del Rio. In\r\nthis case the needle-like crystals were somewhat more slender than those\r\npreviously seen, and some were slightly curved and somewhat more\r\nelongated. These of course interested me as showing the occurrence of\r\nfreezing temperatures no doubt at a somewhat earlier time than that\r\npertaining to my previous observations.\r\n\r\nDuring all these years my residence was in Illinois, and I was naturally\r\nwatching for similar markings in recent mud, resulting from late and\r\nearly frosts. I found them in the fall of 1909. At this time some\r\nexcavations were being made in the loess in Rock Island, when some rains\r\nfell in the late fall. These rains evidently happened to give the mud\r\nthe amount of moisture necessary for such crystals to develop, as the\r\nground froze. The rains had washed the loess extensively, and I found a\r\nnumber of places where it lay redistributed, with a fairly smooth\r\nsurface. It was evident that the moisture content of the ground,\r\ntogether with the temperature conditions, determined the size and the\r\ncloseness of the frozen patterns. In places the crystals were long and\r\nslender, in others they were short and stout. At some points they were\r\nstraight and in others slightly curved. Here and there the patterns were\r\nclose enough to resemble the fine lines which we sometimes notice in the\r\nhoarfrost on windowpanes. In other places the crystals occurred in\r\nradiating groups, and elsewhere they would form scattered separate\r\nunits. For preserving a record of what I saw, I poured plaster over\r\nseveral patterns and had these casts photographed, as appears in Plates\r\nVIII, IX, X. Placing these side by side with the photographs of the\r\npatterns I have photographed from the Eagle Ford, it appears to me that\r\nno doubt can be left as to the origin of the markings found in the\r\nfossil state.\r\n\r\nRecently I have found that these ice crystal marks are quite common at\r\none horizon in the Eagle Ford beds of Brewster County, in Texas. There\r\nis also a layer in which they can be usually seen in the vicinity of\r\nAustin, Texas. This lies about twenty-five feet below the Austin Chalk,\r\nnear Austin. A like layer occurs about 100 feet below the Austin Chalk\r\nin the Big Bend country. Here I have found the markings in localities\r\nthirty miles apart. They occur at the north point of Mariscal Mountain\r\nand in a number of places near the Fossil Knobs and on the Chisos Mining\r\nCompany property at Terlingua.\r\n\r\nUnprofitable as observations on such a simple matter as this may seem, I\r\nfind that other geologists have given it some attention. Quite recently,\r\nDr. John M. Clarke[A] has figured slabs showing what has been described\r\nas _Fucoides graphica_, by Hall. The markings figured by Professor\r\nClarke are undoubtedly of the same kind as those I have found in the\r\nEagle Ford. They occur in the Upper Devonian in New York. I also find\r\nthat the formation of ice crystals in wet mud has been observed in the\r\nclays about Boston by Marbut and Woodworth.[B] Other observations of\r\nsimilar recent markings are said to have been made by some English\r\ngeologists.\r\n\r\nTo \"practical people\" it may indeed appear that no more unprofitable or\r\nmore idle curiosity could be indulged in, than making observations on\r\nwhat kind of crystals are formed when water freezes in mud. I must\r\nconfess that my own first observations had no motive whatever, except\r\nfor the desire to know something new; and I never expected that anything\r\nI could learn about these fossil marks would ever turn out to have any\r\npractical application, at least not in my own work.\r\n\r\nBut it has turned out differently. For some time, I have been called\r\nupon occasionally to advise with regard to the finding of the ore in one\r\nof our quicksilver mines in West Texas. It is now a well established\r\nfact that the distribution of the ore in this mine, and I believe in the\r\nentire Terlingua district, bears a definite relation to geological\r\nhorizons. Successful mining requires search in these horizons. The\r\ncinnabar, as it appears, has accumulated in greatest quantity under\r\nimpervious rocks such as shales and marls along planes that separate\r\nthese from underlying rocks of more open texture, mostly limestones. The\r\nore has clearly come from below and has risen through fissure planes,\r\nwhich in some cases separate large blocks of the Cretaceous formations.\r\nThe best ore has been found under the basal part of the Boquillas flags,\r\nand under the Del Rio clay in the upper part of the Georgetown\r\nlimestone. The workings must be so arranged in the mine that these\r\nhorizons can be entered on both sides of a fault fissure. The problem of\r\nlocating the depth of the desirable horizons in the mine in question\r\nwould be easy enough, if it were not for the fact that the outcropping\r\nrocks consist of a series of sediments with few characteristic fossils.\r\nMost of the fossils which occur extend through a range of several\r\nhundred feet and the beds themselves are quite uniform in character,\r\nconsisting of alternating thin layers of impure limestones and marls. An\r\nattempt was made to correlate the outcropping beds by close examination\r\nof the layers exposed, but the result was not very satisfactory. A close\r\nscrutiny made of each layer on the section resulted, however, in the\r\nfinding of two features that enabled me to measure the throw of the\r\nfault under investigation. Interbedded in the Boquillas flags there are\r\nsome thin layers of bentonite, which are quite persistent and can be\r\nfollowed for several miles. By comparing the distances between these\r\nlayers and by taking note of their individual thickness, it was possible\r\nto make a correlation that seemed to be correct. But the proof sought\r\nfell just short of being certain. In cases of this kind one always looks\r\nfor corroborating facts to check one's conclusions. I found this check\r\nin the discovery of the layer which carries ice crystal markings in\r\nthese beds. The layer had a definite relation to the seams of bentonite,\r\nand, with this additional evidence, I was confident there was no\r\npossible chance of a mistake. It enabled me to locate not only the right\r\nhorizon but also a horizon in the underlying heavy Comanchean limestone,\r\nwhich is water-bearing, and which must be avoided to prevent serious\r\ninjury to the underground operations. I need not add that the\r\ninformation obtained was of real practical value in this case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE I\r\n\r\n\r\nPlate I.

The upper rock shown in the Plate is from the south side of\r\nCuesta Blanca in Brewster County, Texas, and shows casts of crystals\r\nwhich represent fillings of sandy mud projecting slightly down into an\r\nunderlying bed of more argillaceous material. The lower part of the\r\nfigure shows a similarly marked flag from the same formation at a point\r\nabout five miles north of the old Boquillas postoffice near Tornillo\r\nCreek, east of the Chisos Mountains, in Texas. Here are seen the\r\noriginal grooves made by the ice on a layer of muddy material later\r\nburied. Slightly reduced.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE II]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE III\r\n\r\n\r\nPlate III. Photograph of fossil casts of a close tangle of ice crystals\r\nseen in a stony calcareous layer in the Eagle Ford shale in Walnut\r\nCreek, about eight miles north of Austin, Texas. This tangle is closer\r\nthan any of the recent ice crystal marks figured here, but equally\r\nclosely grown crystals have been seen by the writer on frozen mud in\r\nIllinois. Natural size. Compare with Plate VIII.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE III]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE IV\r\n\r\n\r\nPlate IV. Photograph of fossil casts of ice crystals seen on some stony\r\nflags in the upper part of the Eagle Ford at Fossil Knobs, about two\r\nmiles northwest of the Chisos Mine in Brewster County, Texas. These may\r\nbe characterized as relatively short and scattered. This shows ridges\r\nprojecting into the grooves formed by ice crystals on the surface of a\r\nmuddy layer originally underlying the layer photographed. Slightly\r\nreduced.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE IV]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE V\r\n\r\n\r\nPlate V. Photograph of fossil casts of ice crystals seen on the under\r\nside of flaggy layer of calcareous sandy rock in the upper part of the\r\nEagle Ford at Fossil Knobs, about two miles northwest from the Chisos\r\nMining Company's property, Brewster County, Texas. It will be seen that\r\nsome of the crystals are gently curved. Similar curving crystals are\r\nalso seen in the figures showing recent growths at Rock Island,\r\nIllinois. Compare with Plate IX. Slightly reduced.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE V]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE VI\r\n\r\n\r\nPlate VI. Photograph of a thin flag of sandy limestone from the Eagle\r\nFord at Fossil Knobs in Brewster County, showing molds left by ice\r\ncrystals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE VI]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE VII\r\n\r\n\r\nPlate VII. Photographs of three fragments of flags showing casts of ice\r\ncrystals on the under side. All observations made on crystals of this\r\nkind indicate local differences in the forms of ice crystals presumably\r\ndue to differences in the rate of freezing, in the texture of the mud\r\nand probably in variations in water content of the mud. Some crystals in\r\nthe locality from which these specimens came, show pinnate secondary\r\ngrowths. Specimens shown here are from near the upper part of the Eagle\r\nFord at a point about two miles north from the Chisos Mining Company's\r\nproperty. Brewster County, Texas. Slightly reduced.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE VII]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE VIII\r\n\r\n\r\nPlate VIII. Photograph of a cast made by pouring plaster over a surface\r\nof mud in which ice crystals had recently formed, in Rock Island,\r\nIllinois, after the ice in the crystals had been removed by slow natural\r\nsublimation into the atmosphere, leaving open cracks in the mud. The\r\ncomb-like ridges on the plaster cast have the form of the ice crystals.\r\nCompare with Plate III.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE VIII]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE IX\r\n\r\n\r\nPlate IX. Photograph of a cast made by pouring plaster over a surface of\r\nmud in which ice crystals had formed, in Rock Island, Illinois, soon\r\nafter the ice in the crystals had been removed by slow natural\r\nsublimation into the atmosphere, leaving open cracks in the mud. In the\r\nlocality where this cast was made, the crystals were relatively slender,\r\ndistant, and some gently curved, like those seen in Plate V. Slightly\r\nreduced.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE IX]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE X\r\n\r\n\r\nPlate X. Photograph of a cast made by pouring plaster over a surface of\r\nmud in which ice crystals had recently formed, in Rock Island, Ill., and\r\nwhere they had later been removed by natural sublimations into the\r\natmosphere, leaving open cracks in the mud. It will be seen that the\r\ncrystal growth in this case involves an x-like or radiating pattern\r\nformed of relatively very slender forms that almost everywhere are very\r\ngently curved somewhat reminding of the slender thread-like crystals\r\nsometimes seen in frost on windows. I have not yet seen any similar\r\nfossil crystal growths as slender as these. Slightly reduced.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE X]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n\r\n[A] Strand and undertow markings, etc., New York State Museum, _Bulletin\r\nNo. 196, April 1, 1917_, pp. 199-210; pl. 20-23.\r\n\r\n[B] Brick clays of Rhode Island, Massachusetts; Marbut and Woodworth,\r\n_U.S. Geol.
